Evans , April 17 , 1997 ABSTRACT The translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia rearranges the promyelocytic leukemia gene ( PML ) on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor a ( RAR « a ) on chromosome 17 .
This yields a fusion transcript , PML /RARa , a transcription factor with reported dominant negative functions in the absence of hormone .
Clinical remissions induced with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia are linked to PML expression in leukemic cells .
To evaluate the PML /RARa role in myelopoiesis , transgenic mice expressing PML /RARa « were engineered .
A full-length PML/RARa cDNA driven by the CD11ib promoter was expressed in transgenic mice .
Expression was confirmed in the bone marrow with a reverse transcription PCR assay .
Basal total white blood cell and granulocyte counts did not appreciably differ between PML / RARa transgenic and control mice .
Cell sorter analysis of CD11b+* bone marrow cells revealed similar CD11b+ populations in transgenic and control mice .
However , in vitro clonal growth assays performed on peripheral blood from transgenic versus control mice revealed a marked reduction of myeloid progenitors , especially in those responding to granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor .
Granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor and kit ligand co-treatment did not overcome this inhibition .
Impaired myelopoiesis in vivo was shown by stressing these mice with sublethal irradiation .
Following irradiation , PML/RARa transgenic mice , as compared with controls , more rapidly depressed peripheral white blod cell and granulocyte counts .
As expected , nearly all control mice ( 94.4 % ) survived irradiation , yet this irradiation was lethal to 45.8 % of PML /RARa transgenic mice .
Lethality was associated with more severe leukopenia in transgenic versus control mice .
Retinoic acid treatment of irradiated PML/RARa mice enhanced granulocyte recovery .
These data suggest that abnormal myelopoiesis due to PML /RARa expression is an early event in oncogenic transformation .
In acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , the balanced t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation rearranges the promyelocytic leukemia gene ( PML ) on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor a ( RARa ) located on chromosome 17 ( 1-3 ) .
This translocation leads to expression of a fusion transcript , PML/RAR « , in APL cells ( 4-6 ) .
Variant translocations exist and also involve rearrangements with RARa but are much less frequent than the t ( 15 ; 17 ) in APL ( 7 ) .
PML is co-expressed in APL cells with PML and RARa ( 4-6 ) .
All-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) treatment of APL patients causes transient complete clinical remissions in patients whose leukemic cells express PML / RARa ( 6 , 8-10 ) .
Successful RA treatment is associated with in vivo leukemic cell maturation ( 9 , 10 ) .

§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
7900 PML/RARa functions as a transcription factor with dominant negative functions exerted on the RARa or PML pathways ( 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 ) .
That PML/RARa has an inhibitory role in APL cells is consistent with the finding that APL cells have an aberrant nuclear localization of PML .
This abnormality is reversed by RA treatment ( 13 , 14 ) .
Direct inhibitory effects of PML /RARa in myeloid cells was shown through PML expression in U937 or HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells ( 11 , 15 ) .
In NB4 cells , the sole APL line expressing PML/RARa and inducing a mature myeloid phenotype following RA treatment ( 16 ) , over-expression of the nonrearranged alleles , RAR « , or PML , leads to growth suppression of transfectants ( 17 , 18 ) .
This growth suppression is hypothesized to result from antagonism of PML /RARa function in these APL cells .
Biologic effects of an expressed dominant negative RARa in murine myeloid leukemic and progenitor cells have been reported ( 19 , 20 ) .
When endogenous RARa activity is suppressed in myeloid leukemic cells by expression of a dominant negative RARa , granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) -induced neutrophil differentiation is blocked at the promyelocyte stage ( 19 , 20 ) .
The ability of a dominant negative RARa to inhibit neutrophil differentiation at the promyelocyte stage was also reported in murine primary bone marrow cultures ( 20 ) .
The blocked promyelocytes proliferated continuously as a GM-CSF-dependent cell line but were induced to terminally differentiate into neutrophils following RA treatment ( 20 ) .
These findings indicate that expression of a dominant negative RARa « in murine myeloid progenitors alters myeloid maturation and may represent a transformation step leading to leukemia .
These data suggested that PML/RARa expression in early myeloid cells would alter myelopoiesis .
The present study was undertaken to explore the growth and differentiation effects of PML/RARa « in bone marrow myeloid cells in the mouse .
Mice were engineered to express a full-length PML cDNA transgene driven by the CD11b promoter .
PML/RARa expression in bone marrow cells was confirmed using a reverse transcription ( RT ) polymerase chain reaction assay .
Clonal growth assays performed using peripheral blood and bone marrow cells isolated from transgenic mice reveal PML /RARa expression leads to impaired myelopoiesis .

tivity to sublethal radiation with increased depression of total white blood cell ( WBC ) and granulocyte counts .
The recovery of granulocytes and leukocytes was enhanced by RA treatment of transgenic mice .
These findings are consistent with the view that PML /RARa inhibits myelopoiesis and directly contributes to transformation of myeloid cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS RT-PCR Assay and Southern Analysis .
RNA and genomic DNA were purified from NB4 cells and the bone marrow of control and transgenic PML/RARa mice using guanidine thiocyanate and standard techniques ( 21 ) .
PML/RARa expression was assayed in total RNA isolated from harvested bone marrow .
Nested primers and an RT-PCR assay were used with established techniques optimized for detection of PML / RARa mRNA in APL cells ( 6 , 17 ) .
Southern analysis was performed as described previously ( 22 ) .
PML/RARa Transgenic Mice .
The PML/RARa expression vector was constructed using a full-length PML/RARa cDNA ( 4 ) cloned into the NotI site of a Bluescript ( Stratagene ) plasmid .
This was gel-purified after digestion with Bg/II and Xbal .
A Hind ! III/Smal fragment of the CD11b promoter ( 29 ) was ligated at the HindIII site of a Bluescript SK~- plasmid containing a 0.7-kb Xbal/EcoRI fragment of the SV40 Poly ( A ) sequence .
The vector was engineered by bluntly ligating the 5 ' BgilI site in the PML/RARa fragment to the SmaI site in the plasmid and ligating the 3 ' Xbal site of this fragment to an Xbal site in the plasmid backbone .
Transgenic mice were engineered using standard techniques ( 23 ) .
Founder mice were mated to ICR Swiss or non-Swiss mice .
Controls were identical to transgenic mice but did not express PML / RARa .
An independent PML/RARa line was derived to exclude genetic heterogeneity as responsible for an observed phe-notype .
Mice were aged 8-12 weeks and were sex and weight matched .
An approved institutional animal care and use committee protocol was used .
Radiation Protocols .
Control and transgenic mice received y irradiation from a cesium source ( 600 rad/mouse ) .
This caused negligible lethality , transient anemia , thrombocytope-nia , granulocytopenia , and minimal weight loss or other symptoms in control mice .
When radiation-induced leukopenia developed , WBC and granulocyte counts , hemoglobin , hematocrit , and platelet counts were measured generally daily , until WBC recovery .
Granulocytes were counted after crystal violet staining of peripheral blood smears .
To limit phlebot-omy , groups of six or 12 mice had base-line hematologic parameters measured .
After radiation-induced leukopenia , three control or transgenic mice had hematologic parameters measured generally daily .
Mice were rotated for these measurements .
Results were correlated with survival after irradiation .
Whether RA ( Sigma ) limited radiation-induced myelo-suppression in transgenic mice was studied .
Twenty-four PML/RARa transgenic mice were each irradiated with 600 rad .
The day before and of irradiation , 12 transgenic mice were each administered dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO , Sigma ) as a 40-ul i.p .
injection .
The day before and of irradiation , 12 other transgenic mice were each administered RA ( 1 mg ip . )
dissolved in the same DMSO volume as controls .
Clonal Growth and Cell Sorter Assays .
Bone marrow from untreated or 24-h post 5-fluorouracil treated mice were har-vested .
Early hematopoietic progenitors were detected in primary and 7-day `` delta '' culture generated-secondary high proliferative potential colony-forming cells ( HPP-CFCs ) using interleukin-3 , KL , and established techniques ( 24-26 ) .
For 5-fluorouracil-untreated mice , primary cultures were performed using peripheral blood or bone marrow with 5 x 10+ cells/ml supplemented with or without cytokines .
Bone marrow cultures were used for colony forming unit-granulocyte/ macrophage ( CFU-GM ) and burst forming unit-erythroid Proc .
Natl .

USA 93 ( 1996 ) 7901 measurements .
Low proliferative potential colony forming cells ( LPP-CFCs ) were assayed with 2.5 X 10° bone marrow cells .
Cultures were scored at 7 days for CFU-GMs or LPP-CFCs .
HPP-CFC colonies with minimum diameter of 0.5 mm were scored at 10 days .
Assays were performed in triplicate and confirmed in at least triplicate independent experiments .
The recombinant cytokines were ' murine KL at 20 ng/ml ( Immunex ) , murine GM-CSF at 10 ng/ml ( Immunex ) , murine inter-leukin-3 ( Intergen ) at 20 ng/ml , human G-CSF ( Amgen Biologicals ) at 1000 units/ml , human M-CSF ( Cetus ) at 1000 units/ml , and human erythropoietin ( Amgen ) at 2 units/ml .
Cell sorter assays compared CD11b* populations in the bone marrow of these mice .
Cells were incubated with a rat anti-mouse CD11b ( MAC-1 ) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody or an isotype matched , fluorescein iso-thiocyanate-labeled , control antibody ( Caltag ) .
Red blood cells were lysed wtih potassium acetate .
Assays were performed as described ( 17 ) .
RESULTS Transgenic PML expression was confirmed using an RT-PCR assay ( Fig .
1 ) .
The expected short form of PML / RARa mRNA ( 6 ) was found in bone marrow of transgenic ( lane 6 ) but not control mice ( lane 4 ) .
As a positive control , RNA was isolated from the APL cell line ( NB4 ) that expresses the long form of PML /RARa ( 6 , 16 ) along with several splice variants ( Fig .
1 lane 2 ) .
Southern analysis was performed using genomic DNA from a representative transgenic mouse to confirm the entire PML cDNA was present ( data not shown ) .
A full-length PML/RARa cDNA was cloned and sequenced from this mouse .
No sequence additions , deletions , or substitutions were identified in this cDNA ( data not shown ) .
To begin to characterize the phenotype present in this transgenic line , clonal growth assays were performed on bone marrow and peripheral blood .
As expressed per femur , in wild-type versus transgenic bone marrow , total burst forming unit-erythroid ( 4047 + 3059 SEM versus 3814 + 187 SEM ) and CFU-GEMM ( 1017 + 276 SEM versus 998 + 276 SEM ) numbers did not appreciably differ while CFU-GM numbers were slightly higher in wild-type mice ( 37,050 + 21,739 SEM versus 29,386 + 566 SEM ) .
In contrast , peripheral blood cells derived from PML transgenic but not wild-type controls displayed a blunted clonal growth response to GM-CSF ( Fig .

This cytokine is active in the same myeloid populations in which the CD11b promoter is active ( 27-30 ) .

Clonal growth assays were simultaneously performed with bone marrow from five control and five PML/RARa transgenic mice following stimulation with GM-CSF or GM-CSF plus KL .
When findings are expressed per femur , bone marrow clonal growth was only Proc .

Similar results were obtained from a second transgenic line established from an independent founder ( data not shown ) .
_ It is unlikely the CD11b driven PML/RARa transgene is expressed in the earliest myeloid progenitors ( 27-30 ) .
Stem cell assays ( HPP-CFC ) were performed with bone marrow harvested from PML transgenic or wild-type mice to confirm that peripheral blood findings did not reflect observed changes in myeloid stem cells .
Indeed , the responses of these early myeloid progenitors to GM-CSF or GM-CSF plus KL were normal .
Thus , comparable LPP-CFC and HPP-CFC numbers were isolated from 5 wild-type and 5 PML transgenic mice ( data not shown ) .
Similar findings were obtained in a second independent experiment , indicating that changes in stem cell numbers do not account for altered GM-CSF response in peripheral blood from the transgenic line .
Similarly , search for changes in CD11b* populations using cell sorter analysis failed to reveal significant differences between control and transgenic mice ( Fig .
2B ) .
Similar findings were obtained in 22 wild-type and 20 PML/RARa transgenic mice .
Thus , the numbers of CD11b* bone marrow cells do not explain altered GM-CSF cellular response of transgenic mice .
To exclude other changes due to PML expression , necropsies were performed in eight transgenic mice and were compared with findings obtained from eight control mice .
No gross abnormalities were observed in these transgenic or control mice .
Histopathologic studies were performed on the spleen and bone marrow of mice .
No abnormalities were observed ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
24 , peripheral blood clonal growth assays reveal an altered cytokine response of PML /RARa « expressing cells .
To evaluate whether stressing the bone marrow of mice uncovers a phenotype , groups of wild-type and transgenic mice ( matched for age , sex , and weight ) were each irradiated with sublethal total body irradiation ( 600 rad , single dose ) .
Mice were monitored at indicated time points for radiation-induced changes in hematologic parameters , including total WBC and granulocyte counts .
Results of a representative experiment appear in Fig .
34 .
This demonstrates that , as compared with controls , PML /RARa « transgenic mice have a more rapid and sustained decline in total WBC counts ( Fig .
34 ) .
The period of severe granulocytopenia ( < 250 per wl ) was longer in transgenic than control mice ( 8 versus 5 days ) .
As expected , nearly all control ( 94.4 % , 17 of 18 ) mice survived irradiation .
Fig .
3B reflects pooled findings from two independent experiments using 12 and six wild-type mice .
In marked contrast , experiments with 24 PML /RARa transgenic mice ( represent-ing pooled results from two independent experiments each with 12 mice ) reveal that only 54.2 % or 13 of 24 mice survived .
This survival difference between wild-type and transgenic mice is significant using either the Wilcoxon or log rank statistical tests ( P values = 0.0043 ) .
The lethality was not due to acute radiation toxicity , since no deaths occurred until day 7 following irradiation .
Induced lethality was associated with the duration and degree of leukopenia ( Fig .
34 ) and granulocytopenia .
Additional studies were conducted to examine whether RA treatment of irradiated PML/RARa transgenic mice limits induced leukopenia or granulocytopenia .
Vehicle ( DMSO ) -treated PML/RARa transgenic mice served as controls .
The results of a representative experiment appear in Fig .
4 .
Since DMSO protects against radiation-induced damage in vivo ( 31 ) , the end-point for this study was not survival but duration and extent of radiation-induced granulocytopenia .
As compared with controls , PML /RARa transgenic mice treated with RA exhibit more rapid granulocyte recovery .
This reaches statistical significance by day 8 using the two-tailed Student 's ¢ test ~ ( P value < 0.05 ; Fig .

The recovery of granulocyte counts of PML /RARa mice after a single dose of 600 rad/mouse and treatment with DMSO ( vehicle ) or RA .
As compared with controls , this study demonstrates that RA treatment enhances the granulocyte recovery following radiation treatment of these PML transgenic mice .
The more rapid granulocyte recovery at day 8 is statistically significant ( depicted by the * ) using the two-tailed Student 's £ test ( P =.05 ) .
Similar findings were observed in a second independent experiment .
The y axis depicts a logarithmic scale of % basal granulocyte count , and the x axis represents the time in days .
The interrupted line indicates that granulocyte counts were not measured until day 5. expressed in myeloid cells ( 27-30 ) .
The CD11b promoter directs cell type-specific expression in myelomonocytic cells , which are known to be sensitive to GM-CSF ( 27-30 ) .
Since it is likely that the CD11b promoter is not active in myeloid progenitors ( 27-30 ) , it is expected that changes in HPP-CFC and LPP-CFC progenitors would not be found .
In contrast , PML/RARa transgenic expression causes marked suppression of CFU-GMs in peripheral blood clonal growth assays , as shown in Fig .
24 .
The in vitro suppression of CFU-GMs is not overcome when PML myeloid cells are cultured with GM-CSF and KL .
Those colonies forming from control and transgenic peripheral blood were of a smaller size ( 50-200 cells/colony ) than CFU-GMs in bone marrow ( 50-10,000 cells/colony ) and probably represent a more differentiated progenitor population .
Notably , a minimal suppression of CFU-GMs is present in clonal growth assays performed with bone marrow derived from the PML/RARa transgenic line .
This difference between clonal growth results from peripheral blood versus bone marrow cells could reflect the reduced capacity of the PML /RARa transgene to mobilize progenitor myeloid cells to peripheral or extramedullary sites .
This may partly account for the enhanced sensitivity of these transgenic mice to irradiation .
This finding is not without precedence .
For example , mice bearing mutant genes at the W or Steel loci have modest changes observed in bone marrow clonal growth assays , yet these mice also have , as compared with wild-type mice , enhanced radiation sensitivity ( 32-34 ) .
Although almost all control mice survived sublethal irradiation , nearly 50 % of PML/RARa mice succumbed ( Fig .
3B ) .
This lethality was associated with a greater degree of granulocytopenia and leukopenia ( Fig .
34 ) in PML/RARa versus control mice .
Other cellular defects in addition to granulocytopenia and leukopenia could contribute to this increased lethality .
This includes altered granulocytic functions ( migra-tion and phagocytosis ) and altered stromal-bone marrow interactions or splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis ( 35 ) .
Although multiple factors may contribute to this lethality , it is apparent that RA treatment antagonizes some inhibitory effects of PML/RARa on myelopoiesis .
RA treatment of these transgenic mice enhances granulocyte recovery ( Fig .
4 ) .
Finding an inhibitory effect of PML expression on myelopoiesis is not unexpected .
Prior work reveals that in the absence of ligand , PML/RARa functions as an inhibitory transcription factor with putative dominant negative functions ( 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 ) .
In certain myeloid leukemic cells , engineered PML/RARa overexpression inhibits induced differentiation ( 11 , 15 ) .
In defined cell contexts , PML/RARa expression exerts an inhibitory effect on the transactivation of reporters containing retinoic acid response elements ( 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 ) .
Also , 7904 Medical Sciences : Early et al .
PML /RARa expression leads to aberrant nuclear localization of PML in APL cells ( 13 , 14 ) , and RA restores a normal nuclear localization pattern .
Overexpression of either PML ( 17 , 18 ) or RARa ( 17 ) in NB4 cells leads to growth suppression either through a direct growth suppressive effect of PML or RARa or indirectly through an antagonism of the inhibitory PML/RARa effects in APL cells ( 17 ) .
The inhibition of myelopoiesis reported here has clinical implications .
That RA treatment of irradiated mice antagonizes the granulocytopenia found in PML/RARa transgenic mice is reminiscent of the clinical retinoid response of APL patients .
RA treatment overcomes the clinical maturation block found in leukemic promyelocytes , presumably due to antagonism of the actions of PML /RARa in these cells .
Since DMSO protects against radiation damage ( 31 ) , this likely accounts for the more limited granulocytopenia found in vehicle-treated and irradiated PML /RARa mice ( Fig .
4 ) than in transgenic or control mice not treated with DMSO ( Fig .
3 and data not shown ) .
Of note , these PML /RARa transgenic mice do not develop leukemia or obvious hematopathology , despite more than 2 years of follow-up .
Several factors could contribute to these findings .
The low levels of PML/RARa expressed in bone marrow cells from these transgenic mice suggest that an optimal PML gene dosage is required to fully transform myeloid cells .
Appropriate timing of PML/RARa « expression in early myeloid cells might play a critical role in transformation .
Perhaps a myeloid-specific promoter active in even earlier myeloid cells than the CD11b promoter used to engineer this transgenic line will yield higher levels of PML / RARa expression in these progenitors .
Alternatively , a second oncogenic event such as ras or p53 activation may be required to develop leukemia ( 36 , 37 ) .
This PML /R AR a transgenic line may prove useful to identify second oncogenic events contributing to APL development .
Since RA treatment of this irradiated PML /RARa line antagonizes some of the inhibitory PML/RARa effects , this transgene might predict useful therapeutic properties of RA or retinoid analogs before use in APL clinical trials .
In summary , these studies provide the first direct evidence that expression of PML/RARa in mice can trigger abnormal myelopoiesis and increased radiation sensitivity .
RA therapy reverses at least some of these findings , suggesting that PML / RARa mice provide a useful model to further understand the basis of oncogenic transformation and treatment of APL patients .
