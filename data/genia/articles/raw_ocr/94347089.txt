( 1994 ) 302 , 119-123 ( Printed in Great Britain ) 119 Inhibition of activation of transcription factor AP-1 by CD28 signalling in human T-cells Marek LOS , Wulf DROGE and Klaus SCHULZE-OSTHOFF* Division of Immunochemistry , Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum , D-69120 Heidelberg , Germany Co-stimulation of T-lymphocytes by T-cell receptor ( TcR ) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) production .
The increase in IL-2 gene expression triggered by CD28 involves a « B-like sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the IL-2 promoter , called CD28-responsive element .
Stimulation of T-cells by agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) - or TcR-derived signals induces the enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF- « B .
Here we report that CD28 engagement , however , exerts opposite effects on the transcription factor AP-1 .
Whereas anti-CD28 together with PMA increased the DNA binding and trans-activation activity of NF- « B , PMA-induced activation of AP-1 was significantly suppressed .
The inhibitory effect exerted by anti-CD28 was observed at the level of DNA binding as well as in functional reporter-gene assays .
These results suggest that the two transcription factors are independently regulated and may perform different functions during T-cell activation .
INTRODUCTION Activation of T-lymphocytes requires the presence of two signals which are provided by an antigen-specific stimulus delivered through the CD3-T -cell receptor ( TcR ) complex and an antigen-independent mechanism referred to as co-stimulation [ 1,2 ] .
Numerous studies have indicated that TcR engagement in the absence of co-stimulation may induce a state of unresponsiveness ( anergy ) or programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) ( reviewed in refs .
[ 1,2 ] ) .
A major co-stimulatory signal is triggered by the activation of the T-cell surface molecule CD28 , which is the counter structure of the B7-1 and B7-2 antigen present on activated B cells , dendritic cells and monocytes [ 3-5 ] .
CD28 is expressed on almost all CD4* and about 50 % of CD8* T-cells .
Signalling via CD28 readily synergizes with signals through the CD3-TcR for increased cytokine production and cell proliferation [ 6-9 ] .
CD28 functions as a regulator of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) expression at the level of both gene transcription and mRNA stabilization .
The transcriptional stimulation of IL-2 expression by the CD28 co-stimulus is controlled by a « B-like cis-regulatory element ( CD28 regulatory element ) in the IL-2 promoter that can be occupied by transcription factors of the nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B family [ 10,11 ] .
Co-stimulation of T-cells with agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies together with anti-CD3 or agents that mimic TcR-induced protein kinase C activation results in increased nuclear amounts of NF- « B proteins [ 12 ] .
The major biochemical events initiated by CD28 are largely unknown .
Several pieces of evidence suggest a signal-transduction pathway that is distinct from the TcR [ 3 ] .
CD28 signalling is resistant to treatment with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A and does not involve protein kinase C trans-location .
Recently , it has been observed that CD28 mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of a 100 kDa protein [ 13 ] and activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase [ 14 ] and phospholipase C [ 15 ] .
Activation of NF- « B by cytokines and other agents has been shown to rely on the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates and redox-regulated processes [ 16-18 ] .
Among other stimuli , CD28-mediated activation of NF-KB is inhibited by antioxidant compounds , such as N-acetylcysteine and dithio-carbamates [ 19 ] .
A contribution of redox-regulated processes is further supported by the observation that co-stimulation via CD28 leads to a rapid decrease in intracellular thiols [ 19 ] ( M. Los , W. Droge and K. Schulze-Osthoff , unpublished work ) .
Besides NF- « B , another widely used mediator of immediate-early gene expression is the transcription factor AP-1 , which is involved in activation of gene expression associated with various growth and differentiation processes ( reviewed in ref .
[ 20 ] ) .
AP-1 is composed of a heterodimeric complex of the c-fos and c-jun gene products and is activated by complex mechanisms consisting of transcriptional and post-translational events .
We and others have recently shown that alterations of the redox state may exert opposite effects on NF- « B and AP-1 activation [ 21,22 ] .
Several antioxidants , which largely inhibited phorbol ester-induced activation of NF- « B , increased AP-1 activation .
This suggests that the two transcription factors may be oppositely regulated by the redox state of the cell .
Here we report that , in addition , CD28-triggered signalling differentially affects the two transcription factors .
Whereas agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies synergized with phorbol esters for NF- « B activation , in contrast , DNA binding and trans-activation activity of AP-1 were significantly inhibited .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and reagents The human T-cell line Jurkat ( subclone JR ) was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) heat-inactivated fetal-calf serum and aritibiotics .
CLB-CD28/1 , an IgG , monoclonal antibody directed against human CD28 , was provided by Dr. van Liet ( Amsterdam ) and used after purification by Protein G-Sepharose chromatography .
Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and H , O , ( perhydrol ) were purchased from Sigma .
Abbreviations used : TcR , T-cell receptor ; IL-2 , interleukin 2 ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay ; TBS , Tris-buffered saline ; NF , nuclear factor .

120 M. Los , W. Drége and K. Schulze-Osthoff Acetyl-CoA , poly ( dI-dC ) and [ `` *CJchloramphenicol were obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim and Amersham respectively .
Oligonucleotides and plasmids The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to detect the DNA-binding activities of NF- « B and AP-1 were as follows ( the binding sites are underlined ) : NF- « B , 5-AGCTTCAGAG GGGATTTCCGAGAGG-3 ' ; AP-1 , S-AGCTTGAIGAGT-CAGCCGGATC-3 ' .
The oligonucleotides were annealed with complementary strands containing S'-overhanging ends and labelled using Klenow polymerase and [ « -**P ] JdCTP .
The labelled probe was purified from free nucleotides on push columns ( Stratagene ) .
The plasmid TRE2CAT used to determine AP-1-dependent trans-activation activity was generated by insertion of two AP-1-binding sites 5¢ to the tk promoter of pBLCAT2 .
This vector contains the HSV basal tk promoter from residues -109 to +51 linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene [ 23 ] .
The CAT reporter plasmid termed NF- « B4CAT has been described previously [ 17 ] .
It contained four spaced NF- « B-binding motifs upstream of the tk promoter in pBLCAT2 .
To detect non-specific effects on CAT expression , transfections with the parent vector pBLCAT2 were performed .
Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay ( e.m.s.a . )
Cells were stimulated at 1x 10 % /ml with PMA ( 25 ng/ml ! )
or anti-CD28 ( 1.5 ug/ml ) .
After the indicated time points , cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a high-salt buffer containing 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.5 , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 20 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 1 % Nonidet P40 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and 0.01 % aprotinin .
After 10 min of incubation on ice , extracts were cleared by centrifugation .
Equal amounts of the extracts ( about 10 4g of crude protein ; determined by the Bio-Rad assay kit ) were incubated with the NF- « B- and -specific **P-labelled oligonucleotides .
Binding reactions were performed in a 20 wl volume containing 2-4 wl of extract , 4 xl of 5 x binding buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 2.5 mM MgC ! 1 , , 20 % Ficoll ) , 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) as non-specific competitor DNA , 2 g of BSA and 10000-15000 c.p.m .
of the labelled oligonucleotide .
After 30 min of the binding reaction at room temperature , samples were loaded on a 4 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 45 mM Tris-borate , 1mM EDTA , pH 8.0 .
For specificity controls a 200-fold excess of unlabelled probe was applied .
Transfections and CAT assays Transfections were performed by the DEAE-dextran method combined with chloroquine treatment .
Briefly , 1.5 x 10 '' cells were washed in Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ) and resuspended in 2 ml of TBS containing 200 ug of DEAE-dextran , 400 ug of chloroquine and 5-15 4g of plasmid DNA .
Cells were incubated at room temperature with frequent agitation .
After 30 min , the cells were washed in TBS and resuspended in 50 ml of culture medium .
After 24 h , portions of batch-transfected cells were stimulated for 12-15 h with anti-CD28 ( 1.5 ug/ml ) or PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) .
Cell extracts were prepared by three freeze/thaw cycles and measured for protein content .
CAT activity was determined essentially as described [ 24 ] .
Equal amounts of total cell protein were mixed in a 150 wl volume with 0.53 mM acetyl- CoA and 2.2 kBq of [ '*CJchloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C for 8-12 h. Acetylated chloramphenicol was extracted in ethyl acetate , resolved on t.l.c .
plates and quantified on a t.l.c .
linear analyser .
RESULTS Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with anti-CD28 in the presence and absence of PMA .
At 90 min after treatment , cell extracts were prepared and analysed by e.m.s.a .
with an NF- « B- and AP-1-specific oligonucleotide .
As shown in Figure 1 , PMA induced « B-specific DNA-binding activity , which was not observed in unstimulated cells .
Co-treatment of the cells with anti-CD28 in the presence of PMA induced a significant increase in NF- « B binding ( Figure 1 , lane 4 ) .
Incubation with anti-CD28 in the absence of PMA , however , resulted in no or only a weak induction of NF- « B binding ( Figure 1 , lane 2 ) .
These observations confirm previous reports that CD28 signals synergize with the phorbol ester- or anti-CD3-mediated NF- « B activation [ 10-12 ] .
As CD28-induced signalling has been reported to rely on the induction of pro-oxidant conditions and to be inhibited by antioxidants [ 12 ] , we further analysed the above effects in the presence of H,0 , .
Cells treated with H , O , revealed a marked stimulation of NF- « B binding ( Figure 1 , lane 5 ) .
This DNA-binding activity was slightly enhanced on CD28 stimulation ( Figure 1 , lane 6 ) .

A section of the fluorogram is shown .
The arrowhead indicates the position of the AP-1-specific DNA complex .
co-treatment of cells with anti-CD28 and PMA under pro-oxidant conditions resulted in a further enhancement of NF- « B DNA binding ( Figure 1 ; compare lanes 3 and 4 with 7 and 8 ) .
Thus these findings support the idea that PMA- and CD28-induced NF- « B activation are mediated by redox processes .
The same experimental conditions were used to analyse the Inhibition of AP-1 by CD28 signalling 121 Table 1 Effect of PMA , anti-CD28 and anti-CD28 + PMA on NF-xB- and AP-1-dependent transactivation Jurkat T-cells were transfected with NF- « B4CAT , a CAT reporter plasmid controlled by four NF-xB-binding sites , or the AP-1-driven CAT plasmid TREZCAT .
At 24 h after transfection , cells were stimulated with the indicated agents as described in Figure 1 .
After 15 h , cell extracts were prepared and analysed for CAT activity .
Controls were performed with the parent plasmid pBLCAT2 .

AP-1 DNA binding was already detectable in unstimulated cells but was significantly inhibited by anti-CD28 treatment ( Figure 2 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Treatment with PMA induced an increase in AP-1 DNA binding ( Figure 2 , lane 3 ) .
In contrast with NF- « B , however , co-stimulation of the cells with anti-CD28 decreased phorbol ester-induced AP-1 activation to a similar level to that in unstimulated cells ( Figure 2 , lane 4 ) .
Of note is the fact that changes in DNA binding were not observed with an isotype-matched control antibody ( results not shown ) .
The inhibitory effect of anti-CD28 was even more pronounced under pro-oxidant conditions .
H , O , induced a slight increase in AP-1 DNA binding ( Figure 2 , lane 5 ) .
Treatment of the cells with PMA and H , O , reproducibly resulted in weaker DNA binding than stimulation with PMA alone ( Figure 2 , compare lanes 3 and 7 ) .
In addition , co-treatment of cells with PMA and anti-CD28 under pro-oxidant conditions resulted in an almost complete inhibition of AP-1 DNA binding , which was even lower than in unstimulated cells .
In further experiments the time course of CD28-mediated inhibition of PMA-induced AP-1 activation was analysed .
AP-1 DNA binding was greatly activated 1.5 h after PMA treatment , reaching a plateau within 3 h ( Figure 3 , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Thereafter , DNA-binding activity gradually declined .
Anti-CD28-mediated inhibition of AP-1 DNA binding followed a slightly different kinetic course .
Inhibitory effects of anti-CD28 were observed 1.5 h after cell treatment , but were maximal after 3 h ( Figure 3 , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The effects of CD28 activation on NF- « B and AP-1 were further investigated in functional trans-activation experiments ( Table 1 ) .
Jurkat cells were transfected with CAT reporter constructs under the control of either four NF- « B-binding sites ( NF- « B4CAT ) or two AP-1-binding sites ( TRE2CAT ) .
When the transfected cells were stimulated with anti-CD28 , a slight increase in trans-activation of the « B reporter construct was induced ( Table 1 ) .
Incubation with PMA led to a strong enhancement of NF- « B activation .
This increase in CAT activity was further enhanced on co-treatment of the cells with PMA and anti-CD28 .
Similarly to the results from the e.m.s.a. , H,0 , triggered NF- « B activation ( Table 1 ) .
NF- « B-dependent gene expression induced under pro-oxidant conditions was further 122 M. Los , W. Droge and K. Schulze-Osthoff augmented when the cells were stimulated with PMA and a combination of PMA and anti-CD28 . '
Under the same conditions , contrasting effects were observed in cells transfected with an AP-l-regulated CAT plasmid ( Table 1 ) .
PMA induced a more than tenfold increase in CAT activity , whereas anti-CD28 had no effect .
However , when cells were treated with a combination of anti-CD28 and PMA , a significant inhibition of AP-l-dependent gene expression was observed in comparison with cells incubated with PMA alone .
In agreement with the previous DNA-binding experiments , the inhibitory effect of CD28 stimulation was stronger when cells were kept under pro-oxidant conditions ( Table 1 ) .
H , O , increased AP-1 activation , which was suppressed by anti-CD28 .
Also PMA-induced AP-1 activation was markedly inhibited by anti-CD28 under these conditions .
To examine non-specific effects on CAT expression , control experiments with the basal reporter plasmid PBLCAT2 were performed .
Expression of pBLCAT2 showed virtually no responsiveness towards PMA and anti-CD28 stimulation ( Table 1 ) .
Therefore both DNA-binding and transactivation experiments reveal that anti-CD28 selectively potentiates PMA-induced NF- « B activation but exerts inhibitory effects on the activation of AP-1 .
DISCUSSION The present study shows that stimulation of T-cells by phorbol ester and CD28 engagement exerts distinct effects on the activation of the transcription factors NF- « B and AP-1 .
Incubation of Jurkat cells with agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies largely increased PMA-induced activation of NF- « B , as reported in earlier studies [ 10-12 ] .
Activation of NF- « B in response to PMA and anti-CD28 essentially involved post-translational mechanisms and was not suppressed in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors ( results not shown ) .
The stimulating effect of both agents has been attributed to the induction of a pro-oxidant state , as NF- « B activation is efficiently blocked by diverse antioxidant substances [ 15-18 ] .
In addition , treatment of the cells with anti-CD28 induces a rapid and transient decrease in intracellular thiol concentration , suggesting that oxidative mechanisms are involved [ 18 ] ( M. Los , W. Drége and K. Schulze-Osthoff , unpublished work ) .
Activation of AP-1 by phorbol esters presumably involves a separate pathway from that for NF- « B [ 22 ] .
PMA-induced AP-1 activation does not appear to rely on a pro-oxidant effect because it is not inhibited by antioxidants , and is even suppressed under pro-oxidant conditions [ 22 ] .
Furthermore , we and others have recently reported that diverse antioxidants that inhibit NF- « B activation even strongly induce AP-1 DNA binding and trans-activation activity [ 21,22 ] .
Hence it has been suggested that NF-KB is an oxidant-inducible factor , whereas AP-1 can be regarded as an antioxidant-responsive transcription factor .
This study shows that effects similar to those produced by pro-oxidants can be induced by stimulation with anti-CD28 .
Treatment of the cells with anti-CD28 increased NF- « B activation , but significantly inhibited AP-1 .
Therefore these data further suggest that activation of the two transcription factors may be differentially regulated .
The inhibition of PMA-induced AP-1 activation could be caused by several candidate mechanisms ( reviewed in ref .
[ 20 ] ) .
Engagement of the CD28 molecule provokes oxidant conditions , which may counteract a signal provided by protein kinase C. For instance , oxidative stress or other CD28-induced downstream signals such as tyrosine phosphorylation could interfere with the dephosphorylation of c-Jun , which mediates AP-1 activation in response to phorbol esters [ 25 ] .
Other possible explanations may include CD28-induced changes in AP-1 interaction with inhibitory proteins , inhibition of Fos and Jun synthesis , or increased synthesis of repressing members of the family such as Jun B [ 20,26 ] .
These mechanisms , however , appear unlikely , because PMA-induced AP-1 activation does not depend on protein synthesis and inhibition by anti-CD28 was already apparent early after cell treatment .
Is there a biological relevance to these observations ?
Efficient activation of T-cells requires co-stimulatory signals resulting in the increase in IL-2 production and cell proliferation [ 2 ] .
TcR signalling in the absence of these stimuli may induce a long-lasting state of unresponsiveness ( anergy ) or programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) .
Both processes can be antagonized by anti-CD28 , which prevents cell death and restores T-cell responsiveness [ 2,3,27 ] .
In some ways conflicting with our results , it has recently been shown that anergized cells strongly suppress AP-1 activation , which was suggested to contribute to the anergic state [ 28 ] .
Other authors , however , could not confirm these data and found no differences in induction of AP-1 on re-stimulation of anergized versus resting cells [ 29 ] .
In studies with thymocytes and T-cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus , apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation or incomplete T-cell activation was prevented by CD28 co-stimulation [ 30 ] .
Apoptosis in T-cells is an active process requiring de novo protein synthesis [ 31,32 ] .
Several papers have reported that early steps of apoptosis are accompanied by transcriptional induction of the AP-1 subunits c-fos and c-jun [ 33,34 ] .
In addition , antisense RNA constructs of c-fos and c-jun prevent or inhibit cell death [ 34 ] .
Thus it may be conceivable that , in cells undergoing apoptosis , CD28-induced inhibition of AP-1 activation may contribute to the rescuing effect of this co-stimulus .
Future experiments therefore need to reveal whether inhibition of AP-1 activation by CD28 interferes with apoptotic processes resulting from incomplete T-cell activation .
