RAPID COMMUNICATION Thrombopoietin Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in Human Blood Platelets By Yoshitaka Miyakawa , Atsushi Oda , Brian J. Druker , Hiroshi Miyazaki , Makoto Handa , Hideya Ohashi , and Yasuo Ikeda Thrombopoietin is known to be essential for megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis .
Recently , we and others have shown that thrombopoietin induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and other proteins in human platelets and BaF3 cells , genetically engineered to express c-Mpl , a receptor for thrombopoietin .
The Jak family of tyrosine kinases are known to mediate some of the effects of cytokines or hematopoietic growth factors by recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of Stat ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .
Hence , we have investigated whether Stat proteins are present in platelets and , if so , whether they become tyrosine phosphorylated in LONING OF A cDNA for thrombopoietin has enabled us to perform an extensive examination of the biologic functions of this hematopoietic growth/maturation factor .
The results of these studies have indicated that thrombopoietin induces the growth and maturation of megakaryocytic precursors . ''
In support of this conclusion , mice lacking c-Mpl ( a receptor for thrombopoietin ) have significantly reduced numbers of circulating platelets . ''
Despite extensive knowledge of thrombopoietin function , the intracellular events that occur after thrombopoietin binding to its receptor are largely unknown .
It has been reported that , in BaF3 cells engineered to express murine c-Mpl , thrombopoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins , including c-Mpl itself , Jak2 , and Shc . ''
We previously reported that treatment of human platelets with thrombopoietin led to tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins with relative molecular weights of 130 , 95 , 85 , and 52 kD . ''
Using specific antisera , we showed that Jak2 and Shc were two of the proteins that were inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in platelets in response to thrombopoietin . ' ''
Furthermore , we have preliminary data that suggest that treatment of platelets with thrombopoietin ( 1 to 10 ng/mL ) enhances aggregation induced by various agonists such as epinephrine and ADP ( manuscript submitted ) .
These data suggest that c-Mpl on the surface of platelets is functional .
Thus , thrombopoietin appears to be similar to other cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , interleu-kin-3 ( IL-3 ) , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , which are not only required for the proliferation and maturation of progenitor cells but stimulate the functions of mature hematopoietic cells .
Recently , a new class of transcription factors termed Stat ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) have been identified .
'* '' '' They appear to have an essential role in signal transduction elicited by cytokines , hematopoietic growth factors , interferons , growth hormone , prolactin , or epidermal growth factor In all cases , the Stat proteins appear to be dormant in resting cells .
On stimulation of cells with growth factor or cytokine , they become tyrosine phosphory-lated , possibly as a consequence of the activation of a Jak family tyrosine kinase .
The phosphorylation of the Stat pro Blood , Vol 87 , No 2 ( January 15 ) , 1996 : pp 439-446 response to thrombopoietin .
We immunologically identified Stat1 , Stat2 , Stat3 , and Stat5 in human platelet lysates .
Thrombopoietin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in these cells .
Thrombopoietin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in FDCP-2 cells genetically engineered to constitutively express human c-Mpl .
Thus , our data indicate that Stat3 and Stat5 may be involved in signal transduction after ligand binding to c-Mp !
and that this event may have a role in megakaryopoiesis/thrombo-poiesis or possibly a mature platelet function such as aggregation .

tein has been shown to be essential for homo- or hetero-dimerization , translocation into the nucleus , and formation of DNA binding complexes . ''
Given the presence of functional thrombopoietin receptors on platelets and our previous observation of Jak2 activation after stimulation with thrombopoietin , we examined the possibility that platelets may have Stat proteins and , if so , whether they become tyrosine phosphorylated after treatment with thrombopoietin .
We also examined whether Jak2 activation and Stat phosphorylation correlated with parameters of platelet function , eg , aggregation .

After boiling at 95°C for 5 minutes , one-dimensional SDS-electro-phoresis was performed on 10 % or 12 % polyacrylamide gels as described . ''
Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto PVDF membranes in a buffer containing Tris ( 25 mmol/L ) , glycine ( 192 mmol/L ) , and 20 % methanol at 0.2 amps for 12 hours at room temperature .
To block residual protein binding MIYAKAWA ET AL sites , transfer membranes were incubated in TBST ( Tris-buffered saline [ TBS ] , 10 mmol/L Tris , 150 mmol/L NaCl , pH 7.6 , with 0.1 % Tween 20 ) with 10 % chicken egg albumin .
The blots were washed with TBST and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at a final concentration of 1.0 pg/mL in TBST .
The primary antibody was removed and the blots were washed four times in TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody diluted 1:3,000 in TBST .
Blots were then washed four times in TBST .
Antibody reactions were detected with chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Immunoprecipitation .
_ Cell stimulation was terminated by the addition of an equal amount of lysis buffer ( 15 mmol/L HEPES , 150 mmol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L PMSF , 10 mmol/L EGTA , 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate , 0.8 mg/mL leupeptin , 2 % Triton X-100 [ vol/ wt } , pH 7.4 ) .
After 20 minutes on ice , the lysates were centrifuged at 10,0008 ( at 4°C ) for 20 minutes .
The supernatant was removed and incubated with preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose ( 40 uL of 50 % slurry ) for 1 hour .
The desired polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies were then added and incubated for 2 to 3 hours on ice .
Protein A-Sepharose or antimouse IgG-conjugated agarose ( 40 LL of 50 % slurry ) was added and incubated for several hours .
The immune complexes were washed with 1 mL of cold washing buffer ( 15 mmol/L HEPES , 150 mmol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L PMSF , 10 mmol/ L EGTA , 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate , 0.8 mg/mL leupeptin , 1 % Triton X-100 [ vol/wt ] , pH 7.4 ) three times and then lysed with Laemmli 's sample buffer .
When immunoprecipitation of denatured proteins was necessary , cells were lysed first in 1 % SDS and boiled for 5 minutes .
The lysates were diluted 10-fold in the lysis buffer that contains 1 % Triton X-100 before immunoprecipitation .
Measurement of platelet aggregation .
The measurement of platelet aggregation was performed with an aggregometer ( Hema Tracer TM Model 601 ; Niko Bio Science , Tokyo , Japan ) with continuous stirring ( 1,000 rpm ) .
RESULTS In preliminary experiments , we found that human platelets express Statl , Stat2 , Stat3 , and Stat5 but not Stat4 or Stat6 by immunoblotting with specific antisera .
A positive control cell lysate ( RSV-3T3 ) was used to confirm that the Stat proteins were detected with the specific antisera and that the proteins detected in platelets comigrated with the Stat proteins in the control lysates ( Figs 1C and 2C and data not shown ) .
We next examined whether any of the Stat proteins became tyrosine phosphorylated after treatment of platelets with thrombopoietin .
Platelets treated with thrombopoietin ( 100 ng/mL ) for various times were lysed in a buffer containing 1 % Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with specific Stat3 antisera .
The same amount of a 95-kD protein recognized by Stat3 antisera was immunoprecipitated from all cellular lysates ( Fig 1B ) .
After treatment with thrombopoietin , this same protein was tyrosine phosphorylated ( Fig 1A ) .
Thus , platelets have Stat3 and it becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after thrombopoietin treatment .
Similar experiments were performed to examine whether Stat5 was inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in platelets .
Because the anti-Stat5 antibody used does not work for immu-noprecipitations , tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were im-munoprecipitated , from denatured cellular lysates , with a specific antiphosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) .
We found that , in the antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates , increased amounts of a 95-kD protein were recognized by an anti-Stat5 antibody after stimulation of platelets with throm- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Similarly , we examined whether Statl and Stat2 were tyrosine phosphorylated and we could find no evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation of either protein before or after stimulation of platelets with thrombopoietin ( data not shown ) .
Jak2 has been reported to phosphorylate Stat5 on tyrosine in vitro and possibly in vivo .
' '' '** '' Consistent with our previous observations , increased amounts of Jak2 were detected in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates after stimulation of platelets with thrombopoietin ( Fig 2B ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 occurred over a similar time course to that of Stat3 and Stats ( compare Fig 1A and Fig 2A and B ) .
To further confirm the link between thrombopoietin stimulation and Stat3/Stat5 , we examined whether Stat3 and Stat5 were tyrosine phosphorylated in FDCP-2 cells expressing human c-Mpl ( FDCP-hMPL5 ) .
FDCP-hMPLS cells were treated with thrombopoietin ( 100 ng/mL ) for various times and were lysed in a buffer containing 1 % Triton X-100 .
The same amount of a 95-kD protein recognized by Stat3 antisera was immunoprecipitated from all cellular lysates ( Fig 3B ) .
This same protein became tyrosine phosphorylated after treatment with thrombopoietin ( Fig 3A ) .
We also found that M -_ L_ Epi A TPO 1min L J lag time Jak2 was tyrosine phosphorylated after treatment with thrombopoietin ( Fig 3C ) , which corroborates the data obtained in platelets and BaF3 cells transfected with murine c-Mpl .
'* '' '' Furthermore , tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 occurred along with that of Stat3 ( compare Fig 3A and C ) .
We also found that 4G10 immunoprecipitates contained increased amounts of Stat5 and Jak2 from lysates of FDCP-hMPLS cells ( Fig 3D and E ) after thrombopoietin stimulation .
As in platelets , we did not detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl or Stat2 either before or after stimulation of FDCP-hMPLS cells with thrombopoietin ( data not shown ) .
Because of the structural similarity between thrombopoietin and erythropoietin , we also examined whether Stat3 and Stat5 were tyrosine phosphorylated in FDCP-2 cells expressing erythropoietin receptors ( FD-ER3 cells ) .
Erythropoietin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 but not of Stat3 in these cells ( Fig 4A and B ) .
We have found that treatment of platelets with thrombopoietin enhances aggregation induced by various agonists such as shear stress , epinephrine , and ADP ( manuscript submitted ) .
The effect was observed at 1 ng/mL of thrombopoietin and reached a maximum at 10 ng/ml .

We found that epinephrine , which does not induce platelet aggregation in hirudin-PRP , '' '' does so in the presence of thrombopoietin ( manuscript submitted ) .
Figure 5B shows that thrombopoietin ( 10 ng/mL ) did not induce aggregation or shape change .
Subsequent addition of epinephrine induced aggregation within 15 seconds .
When the order of the agonists was re-versed , there was a significant lag time ( the lower line ) .
However , aggregation was still observed within 1 minute after the addition of thrombopoietin , suggesting that the priming of epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation occurred within 1 minute .
Finally , we examined whether other Jak family kinases other than Jak2 may also be tyrosine phosphorylated after treatment of platelets with thrombopoietin .
We found that thrombopoietin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 in platelets and FDCP-hMPLS cells ( Figs 6 and 7 ) .
Under the same conditions , we did not detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3 ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION This report shows the presence of Stat proteins and thrombopoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and MIYAKAWA ET AL Stat5 in human platelets .
Both were also tyrosine phosphorylated in FDCP-hMPLS expressing human c-Mpl , a receptor for thrombopoietin .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins induced by thrombopoietin was apparently limited to Stat3 and Stat5 .
Our data do not rule out the possibility that other unknown Stat-like proteins are also tyrosine phosphorylated in platelets or in FDCP-hMPLS or that Stat1 or Stat2 could be phosphorylated below the level of detection in our systems .
Interestingly , Gurney et al '' '' showed that Stat 1 and 3 were activated , as measured by binding to a sis-inducible element ( SIE ) , in CMK megakaryoblastoid cells stimulated with thrombopoietin .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl was not measured directly by these investigators and further studies will be required to explore the possibility that a variety of Stat heterodimers are formed after thrombopoietin stimulation .
In a study by Goullieux et al , '' it was also reported that phosphorylation of tyrosine at position 697 was essential for DNA binding activity of and that Stats was tyrosine phosphorylated by Jak2 in vitro .
Our data show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 occurred along with that of Stat3 or Stat5 .
Because phosphorylation of Jak2 is known to be accompanied by enhanced kinase activity , '' '' it is likely that Jak2 may at least partially contribute to tyrosine phos- M.W .

PLATELETS AND STAT PROTEINS phorylation of the Stat proteins in our system .
We have found that , consistent with the report of Rodriguez-Linares et al '' '' Tyk2 and Jak1 are also present in human blood platelets and that Tyk2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation of platelets and FDCP-hMPLS cells with thrombopoietin ( Figs 6 and 7 ) .
Thus , Tyk2 may also contribute to tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stat proteins in our system .
Recently , Sattler et al '' '' also reported that thrombopoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 in Mo7e cells and BaF3 cells , which were genetically engineered to express c-Mpl , although Tortolani et al '' '' did not detect increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 in thrombopoietin-treated Mo7e cells .
The reason for the different observations is unknown .
Involvement of both Stat3 and Stat5 in signaling induced by thrombopoietin is interesting in view of the recent reports of activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 but not of Stat3 induced by erythropoietin ( Fig 4 ) , growth hormone , and GM-CSF . ''
Indeed , Stahl et al '' determined that the YXXQ motif in gp130 of IL-6 receptor , which is required for tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 , is absent in the cytoplasmic domain of erythropoietin or GM-CSF receptor .
This motif is present in the c-Mpl cDNA used in our transfection studies . ''
Given that the signal transduction pathways used by these cytokines overlap significantly , the involvement of specific combinations of Jak family members and Stat proteins may contribute to the unique effects of each cytokine .
Previously , we showed that thrombin and thrombopoietin induced distinctively different patterns of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets . ''
Although Jak2 may be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by a few fold in thrombin-stimulated platelets , '' we did not find measurable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 or StatS5 proteins after thrombin treatment of platelets ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the thrombin receptor and c-Mpl appear to use differing signaling pathways and tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stat proteins seems to be unique to the thrombopotetin receptor activation in platelets .
One of the most interesting findings in this study is the presence of Stat proteins in human platelets because they are devoid of nuclei .
One possibility is that they are simply remnants from megakaryocytes .
However , this would be consistent with a role for Stat proteins in megakaryopoiesis/thrombo-poiesis .
Another more intriguing hypothesis is that Stat proteins may have roles in platelet activation .
Indeed , we found that thrombopoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 was observed at concentrations of thrombopoietin of 1 ng/mL and reached a maximum at 10 ng/mL ( Fig 5A ) .
In separate experiments , we found that thrombopoietin primed platelet aggregation induced by various agonists in a similar dose range ( manuscript submitted ) .
Furthermore , the priming of epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 occurred within 1 minute after stimulation of platelets with thrombopoietin ( compare Figs 1A , 2A , and 5B ) .
Because serum levels of thrombopoietin may reach 10 ng/mL in thrombocytopenic patients , '' these data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stats and priming of platelet aggregation by thrombopoietin occurred in a similar time framework and in a dose range that 445 can be achieved in pathophysiologic states .
Because thrombopoietin may enhance the activation of platelets , it is possible that Stat proteins , perhaps through their SH2 domains , could be an element in this enhancement .
Most importantly , these data show that thrombopoietin is similar to other cytokines , such as GM-CSF , IL-3 , and G-CSF , that are not only required for the proliferation and maturation of progenitor cells but stimulate the functions of mature hematopoietic cells .
