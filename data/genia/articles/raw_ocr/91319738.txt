Fields , April 8 , 1991 ABSTRACT Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) expression and replication are under tight regulatory control .
We demonstrate that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol { 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ] enhances the replication of monocyte- and lympho-cyte-tropic strains of HIV-1 up to 10,000-fold in monocyte cell lines , peripheral blood monocytes , and unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is therefore one of the most potent regulators of HIV-1 replication described to date .
Precursors of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; enhance HIV-1 replication in proportion to their affinity for the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; intracellular receptor , suggesting that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; influences HIV-1 replication by mechanisms involving this receptor .
These studies may have important implications for the design of effective therapy of HIV-1 infection .
The monocyte is thought to play a crucial role in the patho-genesis of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -related illness ( 1 ) .
It is possible that active viral replication in mono-cyte/macrophages may lead to tissue injury , transmission of virus to other cell types , passage of virus between various organ systems within the body ( e.g. , across the blood-brain or blood-retina barrier ) , and eventual progression to HIV-related illness .
Understanding the factors that regulate HIV-1 replication in monocytes could lead to new approaches capable of modulating disease expression in those tissues harboring HIV-1-infected monocyte/macrophages .
Expression of HIV in monocytes is under the control of several cell regulatory factors ( 2 , 3 ) .
1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] , the biologically active form of vitamin D , has multiple effects on cellular differentiation and function , including regulation of surface differentiation anti-gens , oncogene expression , cytokine production , protein kinase C activity , phagocytosis , and heat-shock protein production ( reviewed in refs .
4 and 5 ) .
Since HIV-1 replication is related to the cell surface expression of CD4 antigen ( 6 , 7 ) and the state of activation of cells ( 8 , 9 ) , we hypothesized that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , might affect HIV-1 replication .
To test this hypothesis , we evaluated HIV-1 replication in a monocytoid cell line , peripheral blood monocytes , and unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
HIV-1 replication was enhanced by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in all of these cells at physiologic and supra-physiologic concentrations .
This enhancement involves the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; intracellular receptor ; precursors and analogs of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; enhance HIV-1 replication in proportion to their affinity for this receptor .

6632 MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines and Virus Stocks .
BT4A3.5 ( A3.5 ) cells are a clone of monocytic cells that were isolated from human bone cell cultures ( these cells were originally isolated and characterized by S. R. Goldring , E. P. Amento , B. Jahn , A. Duran , and S.M.K. , unpublished ) .
The cells are CD4* , HLA-DR * , CD15* ( Leu-M1* ) , and CD3~ , they produce interleukin 1 after stimulation with endotoxin , and they are susceptible to infection with lymphocyte- and monocyte-tropic strains of HIV-1 .
Peripheral blood monocytes were separated from PBMC of HIV-1 seronegative donors by counterflow cen-trifugation ( elutriation ) in a Beckman JE-5.0 elutriator chamber and rotor .
This method allows for the separation of large numbers of minimally activated , highly purified monocytes ( 10 ) .
U937 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection .
HIV-lims and H9 cells were a gift of R. Gallo ( National Institutes of Health ) .
U1 cells and HIV-1§..1 were provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases AIDS Reagent Program .
All cells used in these experiments ( except U1 cells ) were tested and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination .
Cultures of A3.5 Cells .
A3.5 cells were infected with HIV-1ing { multiplicity of infection ( moi ) = 1 x 107 tissue culture infectious doses , ( TCIDs , ) per celll and cultured in Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( GIBCO or Sigma ) .
TCID ; , was determined by serial dilution of viral stock supernatant fluid and the induction of syncytium formation by C8166 cells as described ( 11 ) .
Every 3-4 days , culture supernatants were sampled for HIV-1 p24 antigen production by ELISA ( DuPont/NEN ) .
Supernatant fluids and cells were tested for their ability to induce syncytium formation in C€8166 cells .
Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion .
At selected times , cells from the cultures were stained by indirect immunofluorescence , after blocking Fc receptors with heat-aggregated immunoglobulins , using a polyclonal antiserum against HIV-1 and a fluorescein isothi0o-cyanate-conjugated sheep antibody F ( ab ' ) , fragment to human immunoglobulin ( Organon Teknika-Cappel ) .
The percentage of positive cells was determined by counting at least 300 cells using a Zeiss Axioskop MC100 microscope .

Cultures with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and Precursors .
A3.5 cells were incubated for 24 hr in the presence of various concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , infected with HIV-ljs ( moi = 1 x 10~ > TCIDs , per cell ) , and then cultured with the appropriate concentration of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Every 3-4 days , supernatant fluids were assayed for HIV-1 p24 antigen production by ELISA ( DuPont/NEN ) and , on selected days , were assayed for HIV-1 virus yield [ performed as described ( 11 ) ] .
An aliquot from each sample was assayed for cell viability by trypan blue exclusion .
Fresh medium was added every 3-4 days with the appropriate concentration of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
For the experiment depicted in Fig .
2B and others ( including those with peripheral blood monocytes ) , HIV-1 ( moi = 5 x 10~ > TCIDs , per cell ) and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; were added simultaneously to the cells .
Cocultures of PBMC .
PBMC were isolated from HIV-1 seropositive individuals by Ficoll/Hypaque density centrif-ugation of heparinized peripheral blood ( < 10 units/ml ) .
Cocultures were performed with PBMC from HIV-1 seronegative donors prestimulated for 3-4 days with phytohemagglu-tinin P ( Difco ) and interleukin 2 ( Pharmacia ) as described ( 12 ) .
Four parallel cocultures were performed : these cocultures contained 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 24 nM ) , Polybrene ( 2 ug/ml ; Sigma ) , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and Polybrene ( 24 nM and 2 ug/ml , respectively ) , or no 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; or Polybrene .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and Precursors .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was a gift of M. R. Uskokovi¢ ( Hoffmann-La Roche ) .
Cholecalciferol and 7-dehydrocholesterol were obtained from Sigma .
25-Hydroxycholecalciferol [ 25 ( OH ) D ; ] was a gift of M. F. Hol-ick ( Boston University School of Medicine , Boston , MA ) .
Surface Marker Expression Determination .
A3.5 cells were incubated for 45 min with heat-aggregated immunoglobulins to block Fc receptors and then stained by indirect immunofluorescence with the relevant monoclonal antibody and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse conjugate ( 13 ) .
After fixation with 1 % paraformaldehyde , at least 2000 cells per sample were analyzed by flow cytometry .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) 6633 curred 7 days after infection .
Chronic infection ensued with 17-60 % of the cells expressing HIV-1 antigens at any given time .
We thus know that this cell line is susceptible to infection with HIV-1ms and can be maintained continuously in culture with ongoing HIV-1 replication .
The experiments carried out in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; or its precursors in the present investigations all utilized acutely infected A3.5 cells .
A3.5 cells were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for 24 hr and then infected with HIV-1 igs ( moi = 1.0 x 107 TCIDs , per cell ) .
As shown in Fig .
2 A and B , HIV-1 replication was enhanced by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in a dose-dependent manner .
Enhancement was between 1000- and 10,000-fold in the presence of 24 nM or 240 nM 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; after 10-14 days of culture .
Virus yield assays confirmed this augmentation ; for example , virus titers ( TCIDs , per ml ) after 10 days of culture in the experiment depicted in Fig .
24 were 2.1 x 10° , 1.5 x 104 , 1.0 x 10° , and 1.0 x 10 '' in the presence of 0 M , 2.4 nM , 24 nM , and 240 nM 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , respectively .
These experiments were replicated nine times with changes in the protocol that included various moi of HIV-1ims ( 6 x 107+ , 1 x 107 '' , and 5 x 10-5 ) , concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; from 12 pM to 240 nM , and either pretreatment of cells with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , or simultaneous addition of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and HIV-1 .
Enhancement was seen with every protocol at every concentration of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; tested from 7-10 days after infection of the cells with HIV-ligg .

and 2.5- to 10-fold at 0.12 nM .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is normally present in plasma at concentrations of ~0.12 nM ; therefore , enhancement of HIV-1 replication occurs at physiologic concentrations .
One-hundred- to 10,000-fold enhancement was always demonstrated after 10-14 days of culture in the presence of 24 nM 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
This may be important since local concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in vivo may exceed circulating plasma levels .
No effect on HIV-1 replication was observed in the presence of the 95 % ethanol used to dissolve the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; at a dilution of 1:2000 .
The effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on HIV-1 replication were not limited to the A3.5 monocyte line .
In the experiments shown in Table 1 , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; enhancement of HIV-1 replication in U937 cells ( another monocytoid line ) exceeded that in A3.5 cells .
However , HIV-1 replication was not induced by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in the U1 clone of U937 cells .
The U1 clone is chronically infected with HIV-1 , and HIV-1 replication can be modulated by several cytokines and other activating agents ( 2 , 14 , 15 ) .
Enhancement of HIV-1 replication was also not observed in the lymphoblastoid cell line H9 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on HIV-1 replication may be largely limited to monocytic cells .
Since monocytoid lines may differ from peripheral blood monocytes in their response to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , we studied the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on the replication of a monocyte-tropic strain of HIV-1 in peripheral blood monocytes .
Monocytes were separated from blood of HIV-1 seronegative donors by elutriation ( counterflow centrifugation ) , allowed to adhere for 24 hr to plastic culture wells precoated with AB+ human serum , and then infected in vitro with HIV-15 , .1 ( 16 ) and treated with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
These cells were > 98 % monocytes and were > 98 % viable as determined by morphology , a-naphthyl esterase staining , phagocytosis of latex beads , and trypan blue exclusion .
A 4- to 12-fold enhancement of HIV-1 replication , compared with infected cells cultured without 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , was seen at concentrations of late with increased HIV-1 replication ; we hypothesized that alterations in monocyte CD4 expression might affect HIV-1 replication .
The expression of CD14 , CD11b , and CD15 antigens in A3.5 cells increased in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ; the expression of CD4 and HLA-DR was unchanged ( Table 2 ) .
The expression of CD14 increased in a dose-dependent fashion after treatment with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in concentrations ranging from 24 pM to 240 nM ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , modulation of CD4 expression was not correlated with enhancement of HIV-1 replication by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in A3.5 cells .
It should be noted , however , that the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on cell surface antigen expression in different monocyte cell lines and peripheral blood monocytes can vary .
For example , CD4 and HLA-DR expression are reduced in peripheral blood monocytes , whereas CD14 and class I HLA antigen expression are unaffected after exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 17 ) .
To determine whether the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; intracellular receptor might be involved in the enhancement of HIV-1 replication by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , we studied the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; precursors on HIV-1 replication .
These precursors of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; either bind with greatly reduced affinity ( 105 fold ) to the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; intracellular receptor ( cholecalcif-erol and 7-dehydrocholesterol ) or bind with somewhat reduced ( 10+ to affinity [ 25 ( OH ) D ; ; refs .
5 , 18 , 19 ] .
When A3.5 cells were infected with HIV and cultured in the presence of cholecalciferol or 7-dehydrocholesterol at concentrations ranging up to 26 nM , no enhancement of HIV-1 replication was observed .
In contrast , HIV-1 replication was enhanced in the presence of 25 ( OH ) D ; .
The potency of 25 ( OH ) D ; was =200- to 500-fold less than that of Table 2 .

1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ; 500 nM 25 ( OH ) D ; enhanced HIV-1 p24 antigen production to the same extent as 0.96 nM and 2.4 nM 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on days 7 and 10 of culture , respectively .
These results are consistent with a mechanism of induction of replication that involves the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor .
Typical 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors demonstrated previously in U937 cells were also found in the A3.5 cells ( data not shown ; method as in ref .
20 ) .
DISCUSSION These studies demonstrate that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; enhances HIV-1 replication in monocyte cell lines , peripheral blood monocytes , and cocultures of PBMC from HIV-1 seropositive individuals to a degree similar to or greater than that observed with the most potent regulator of HIV-1 expression ( the HIV-1 tat protein ) described to date .
We consistently observed enhancement at physiologic concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( ~0.12 nM ) in the experiments with the A3.5 cell line and peripheral blood monocytes separated by elutriation { e.g. , Fig .
2B [ normalized to control values without 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] } .
This enhancement occurred in a dose-dependent manner .
It should be mentioned that local concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; may be higher than circulating levels .
In addition , UV irradiation can transiently increase circulating levels of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in normal volunteers ( ~25 % ) and dramatically increase 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; levels in vitamin D-deficient patients ( ~300 % ; ref .
21 ) .
Vitamin supplements increase 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and 25 ( OH ) D ; levels above the physiologic level ; our in vitro data indicate that this might be an undesirable effect .
After performing dose-response experiments in each cell type , we chose to study higher doses in subsequent experiments to more easily measure differences in the effects on these cells .
The cellular and molecular events underlying the immuno-modulatory effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; have not been fully elu-cidated .
One of the major effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is the induction of changes in calcium flux across cell membranes ; this may occur after binding of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to its cytosolic receptor or more rapidly , without transcriptional effects , after interaction of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; with the cell membrane ( 22 , 23 ) .
Several lines of evidence indicate that HIV infection of cells , or the binding of HIV-1 gp120 to CD4 , also results in increased levels of intracellular calcium and inositol triphos-phate , which may be associated with modulation of HIV replication or pathogenic effects of HIV ( 24 ) .
HIV-1 gp120 induces an increase in concentration of intracellular free calcium that is associated with toxicity to rodent retinal ganglion cells and hippocampal neurons ; these effects are abrogated by the calcium channel blocker nimodipine ( 25 ) .
Diphenylhydantoin inhibits the HIV -induced increase in concentration of intracellular calcium and potentiates the anti-retroviral activity of zidovudine ( AZT ) in some cell lines ( 26 ) .
Steroid hormones influence transactivation of promoter regions in other retroviral systems .
The mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat ( LTR ) contains a cis-acting target [ glucocorticoid response element ( GRE ) ] for the glu-cocorticoid-receptor complex ( 27 , 28 ) .
This DNA-protein/ receptor interaction increases transcription from linked initiation sites relatively independently of the orientation of the GRE or its distance from heterologous promoters ( 27 ) .
Cellular transcription factors ( the mouse homolog of NF-1 , F-i ) may also be important in this interaction ( 29 , 30 ) .
NF-1 may influence the effect of various steroids on the relevant hormone response element ( HRE ) in this system by binding to regions outside of HRE ( 31 ) .
Steroid hormones may also affect HIV-1 replication .
Tamoxifen can block phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced HIV-1 replication in the U1 clone , and tamoxifen and dexamethasone block PMA enhancement of expression of a Proc .

Some investigators have reported inhibitory effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on HIV-1 replication in U937 cells ( 34 ) .
Others have shown that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; facilitates HIV-1 infection and replication in HL-60 and chronically infected U937 cells ( 35 , 36 ) .
Our investigations demonstrate enhancement of HIV-1 replication in acutely infected monocyte cell lines ( A3.5 and U937 cells ) and peripheral blood monocytes ; however , the U1 cell line behaves quite differently than its `` parental '' U937 cell line and the A3.5 cell line in experiments involving induction by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Monocytoid cell lines often differ from each other in several ways , including cytokine production , the detailed kinetics of HIV-1 replication , cell surface marker modulation , and kinetics of cellular proliferation .
Our experiments showing enhancement of HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood monocytes may be particularly important in this regard as they suggest that models showing enhancement of HIV-1 replication by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , may more closely parallel the in vivo situation .
Our investigations also suggest the importance of the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; intracellular receptor in these effects .
Intracellular receptors for 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; are found in many tissues , including brain , thymus , bone marrow , intestine , colon , kidney , bone , muscle , and lung ( 4 ) .
Monocytes and activated , but not resting , T cells have this receptor .
Several possible explanations for the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; observed in the present study are possible .
The steroid hormone and its intracellular receptor may bind to the relevant response elements within the genome and , in the case of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , alter intracellular calcium levels or other relevant cellular correlates of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; activity .
Alternatively , the recep-tor-ligand complexes could bind to regulatory regions within the HIV-LTR that share sequence homology to the relevant steroid hormone response elements ( 37 , 38 ) .
It is also known that steroid receptor binding sites are often found clustered with binding sites for other cellular transcription factors [ e.g. , NF-kB and Sp-1 ( 39 ) ] ; these may act synergistically to enhance HIV-1 replication or steroid hormone effects .
UV light can induce HIV-1 expression , perhaps through a mechanism involving heat-shock proteins ( 40 , 41 ) .
UV light activation of a HIV-LTR construct in transgenic mice has been demonstrated ( 42 ) .
Enhancement of HIV-1 replication by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , may be relevant in this in vivo system , since UV light is known to promote 25-hydroxylation of cholecalciferol in skin .
Our studies may have important biological and clinical implications .
We have described a monocyte cell line that can be infected with HIV-1 and provides a model to study factors that influence HIV-1 replication during acute infection .
Studies with chronically infected cells should also be possible .
The addition of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to cell cultures should optimize recovery of HIV-1 and aid in the diagnosis of HIV infection .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; or compounds that generate 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( e.g. , cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol ) might have adverse effects in individuals infected with HIV-1 .
These compounds are used to treat several diseases , and some are readily available in health-food stores as vitamin supplements .
Finally , specific antagonists of the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; might inhibit virus replication .
Such compounds could provide novel therapeutic agents for HIV-1-infected individuals .
