Genometrix , The Woodlands , TX 77381 Contributed by David Botstein , June 11 , 1999 ABSTRACT cDNA microarrays and a clustering algorithm were used to identify patterns of gene expression in human mammary epithelial cells growing in culture and in primary human breast tumors .
Clusters of coexpressed genes identified through manipulations of mammary epithelial cells in vitro also showed consistent patterns of variation in expression among breast tumor samples .
By using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against proteins encoded by a particular gene in a cluster , the identity of the cell type within the tumor specimen that contributed the observed gene expression pattern could be determined .
Clusters of genes with coherent expression patterns in cultured cells and in the breast tumors samples could be related to specific features of biological variation among the samples .
Two such clusters were found to have patterns that correlated with variation in cell proliferation rates and with activation of the IFN-regulated signal transduction pathway , respectively .
Clusters of genes expressed by stromal cells and lymphocytes in the breast tumors also were identified in this analysis .
These results support the feasibility and usefulness of this systematic approach to studying variation in gene expression patterns in human cancers as a means to dissect and classify solid tumors .
Many of the new genomic analysis tools offer great promise for classifications of tumors based on variations in gene expression .
However , the study of gene expression in primary human breast tumors , as in most solid tumors , is complicated for two major reasons .
First , breast tumors consist of many different cell types , including not just the carcinoma cells , but also additional epithelial cell types , stromal cells , adipose cells , endothelial cells , and infiltrating lymphocytes ( 1 ) .
Second , breast carcinoma ( BC ) cells themselves are morphologically and genetically diverse ( 2 ) .
These features have made the study and classification of human breast tumors difficult .
Recently , cDNA microarrays have been used to identify physiologically relevant gene expression patterns in simple biological samples like yeast cultures ( 3 ) and cultures of human fibroblasts ( 4 ) .
cDNA microarrays have been extensively described and simply consist of thousands of different cDNA clones spotted onto known locations on glass microscope slides ( 5-11 ) ; these slides/microarrays then are hybridized with differentially labeled cDNA populations made from the mRNAs of two different samples .
The primary data obtained are ratios of fluorescence intensity ( red/green , R/G ) representing the ratio of concentrations of mRNA molecules that hybridized to each of the cDNAs represented on the array .

9212 breast tumors , in vitro experiments were performed by using specific hormones added to breast epithelial cell cultures .
By subjecting cells to different conditions , it was possible to identify `` clusters '' of genes that showed similar patterns of expression by using the algorithms and software described by Eisen et al .
( 12 ) .
In a first attempt to study tumors , mRNA samples from 13 grossly dissected human breast tumors were compared to the mRNA from cultured human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) .
Some of the clusters of genes with distinctive expression patterns identified in vitro also varied substantially in their expression in the breast tumor samples .
For some of the clusters of coexpressed genes , expression in the tumor samples appeared to be attributable to other , noncarcinoma cell types , including stromal cells and B lymphocytes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA Clones , Microarrays , and Data Analysis .
The 5,531 human cDNA microarrays used in this study were made in collaboration with Synteni , Inc. ( now Incyte Pharmaceutical , Inc. ) .
These microarrays were hybridized as described in ref .
4 and scanned and quantitated as described in ref .
3 by using the average of the lower 10 % of the pixel intensities for the local background calculation .
The cDNA clones used to make these microarrays represent a set of approximately 5,000 genes , which is part of a larger 15,000 gene/clone collection that has been described elsewhere ( refs .
4 and 13 and see http : // www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/LCG/15K/HTML/ ) .
Sequence confirmation of this clone set is not completed ; but the identities of approximately 80 % of the clones that were successfully resequenced were confirmed .
Many clones are identified here by either a name or number , which is preceded by the designation SID ( which stands for the Stanford identification number ) ; these are clones for which satisfactory confirmation is still lacking .
All clones/genes named in the text or in the figures ( including LM.A.G.E .
expressed sequence tag num-bers ) were confirmed by resequencing .
Any questions concerning cDNA clones/genes presented here should be directed to C.M.P .

Gene-clustering analysis was performed as described in ref .
12 .
For the cluster diagrams presented in Figs .
1 and 2 , the input parameters were to select the subset of genes that had a R/G ratio of 3-fold or higher on at least two or more arrays ( Fig .
1 ) or a R/G ratio of 3-fold or higher on at least three or more arrays ( Fig .
2 ) .

( C ) Expanded view of the IFN-regulated gene cluster .
In many instances , multiple independent clones/cDNA representing the same gene were spotted on different locations on these microarrays , and in most cases , these copies usually clustered together , either very near each other or immediately adjacent to each other .
Cell Culture .
HMEC were obtained from Clonetics ( San Diego ) and grown in the recommended complete mammary epithelial growth medium .
A single HMEC isolate was used for all studies .
The control HMEC reference samples used were passage 9-14 cultures that were harvested at 60-80 % confluence and had their medium changed 2 days before the mRNA harvest .
To determine how much variation in gene expression there was in these independently prepared HMEC samples , two different passage HMEC control samples were compared on a 1,952-gene microarray ( data not shown ) .
Of the 1,952 genes analyzed , four genes showed a R/G ratio between 2.3 and 2.0 , 14 genes showed a R/G ratio between 0.5 and 0.37 , whereas all other genes tested that gave an appreciable signal fell into the R/G ratio range of 2 to 0.5 ( 2-fold difference or less ) .
The senescent HMEC cells were a passage-19 culture that showed very little cell division over a 2-week period , with senescence occurring at the M1 stage ( 14 ) ; these senescent cells also contained numerous large vacuoles , which were rarely seen in early to mid passage cells and have been shown previously to occur in senescent fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and HMEC cultures ( 15-17 ) .
For the confluent HMEC sample , the cells were allowed to reach 100 % confluence and refed with fresh medium , and mRNA was harvested 2 days later .
The epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) withdrawal HMEC samples were prepared as described in ref .
18 .
The Matrigel ( Becton Dickinson ) samples were prepared by applying a thick coating of Matrigel to tissue culture plates according to the manufac- turer 's instructions , followed by the seeding of the plates with 2 X 10° HMEC ; mRNA then was harvested 24 hr after plating .
Individual hormones were added to 60-70 % confluent HMEC cultures .
In each case , the concentrations of hormone used were based on previously published studies ( 19 , 20 ) , with the medium removed and replaced with complete mammary epithelial growth medium ( MEGM ) that contained either 7 ng/ml transforming growth factor B-1 ( TGF-B1 ) ( R & D Systems ) , 500 units/ml universal type I IFN-a « ( RDI , Flanders , NJ ) , or 33 ng/ml IFN-y ( RDI ) followed by a 24-hr incubation at 37°C .
MCF7 cells ( J. Weinstein , National Cancer Institute ) and HsS78T cells ( American Type Culture Collection ) were grown in RPMI + 10 % FCS + penicillin/streptomycin to 70-80 % confluence .
HB2 cells ( 21 ) were obtained from H. S. Wiley ( University of Utah ) and grown in complete MEGM medium .
mRNA Isolation from Cells and Breast Tumors .
Cultured cells were harvested by scrapping and mRNA was prepared by using an Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 mRNA Isolation Kit and protocol .
All of the breast tumor samples used in this study were pieces of the primary tumor except for BCS-LN35 , which was a BC-filled lymph node , and BC1257-M , which was a BC metastasis to an ovary .
After surgical resection , the breast tumors were dissected and a piece ( s ) was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C .
A frozen tumor specimen then was cut into small pieces and immediately placed into 12 ml of TRIzol Reagent ( GIBCO/BRL ) .
The tumor sample in TRIzol was homogenized by using a PowerGen 125 Tissue Homogenizer ( Fisher Scientific ) , and total RNA was isolated 9214 Genetics : Perou et al .

by using the TRIzol reagent protocol .
Tumor mRNA was isolated by using the above-mentioned Invitrogen kit and protocol .
The normal breast samples used here were obtained from CLONTECH and were pools of six ( NorBst1 ) or two ( NorBst2 ) whole normal breasts .
Histology and Immunohistochemistry .
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded sections from all tumors in this study by using either a STAT1 mAb ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or a Ki-67 antibody ( Immunotech , Westbrook , ME ) following the protocol described in ref .
22 .
Antibody reactivity was detected by using diaminobenzidine , and each section was counterstained with hematoxylin to visualize tumor morphology .
RESULTS To begin to define patterns of gene expression relevant to mammary epithelial cell biology , a HMEC line growing in vitro was subjected to a set of experimental perturbations .
These included ( ¢ ) addition of TGF-B1 for 24 hr , ( # ) withdrawal of EGF for 2 days , ( ii ) withdrawal of EGF for 2 days followed by the addition of EGF for 90 min , ( iv ) addition of IFN-a for 24 hr , ( v ) addition of IFN-y for 24 hr , ( vi ) response to 100 % confluence , ( viz ) response to senescence , and ( viii ) growth on Proc .

The mRNAs from these experimental cultures each were labeled with the Cy5/red fluorescent nucleotide .
All but one of the experiments presented in this paper ( i.e. , the EGF addition experiment that used the -EGF sample as the Cy3-labeled sample ) used the same green reference sample , which was a Cy3-labeled cDNA sample prepared from mRNA taken from 60-80 % confluent , passage 9-14 , normally growing HMEC cultures .
The data from this study were analyzed and displayed as described ( 12 ) .
Briefly , a hierarchical clustering algorithm produces a table of results wherein the elements/cDNAs of the array ( representing specific genes ) are grouped together based on similarities in their patterns of gene expression .
The same algorithm is applied to cluster the experimental samples ( i.e. , cell lines and tumors ) according to the similarities in their overall patterns of gene expression .
The data tables , thus ordered , are presented graphically as colored images .
Along the vertical axis , the genes analyzed are arranged as ordered by the clustering algorithm , so that the genes with the most similar patterns of expression are placed adjacent to each other .
Along the horizontal axis , experimental samples are similarly arranged such that those with the most similar patterns of expression across all genes are placed adjacent to each other .
The color of each cell/square in this tabular image represents the measured expression ratio of each gene in question .
The color saturation is also directly proportional to the magnitude of the measured gene expression ratio with the brightest red squares having the highest R/G ratio ( i.e. , > 8-fold difference ) , the brightest green squares having the lowest R/G ratio , black squares indicating a ratio of approximately 1 , and gray squares indicating insufficient data quality .
Fig .
14 shows the single cluster diagram produced by the set of HMEC in vitro experiments ( see also Fig .
5 , which is published as supplemental data to this article on the PNAS web site , www.pnas.org ) .
Six of the eight experimental treatments tested here caused a significant reduction in the proliferation rate of these cultures , which is reflected by the variation in expression of a set of genes highlighted in the uppermost portion of Fig .
14 .
This set of genes included many genes involved in the progression through the cell cycle and included the human homologue of the yeast CDC47 gene ( MCM2 ) , MCM3 , MCM6 , cyclin B1 , and the proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67 ( Fig .
1B ) .
The repression of cell-cycle transit and DNA replication is consistent with the inhibition of proliferation that is known to occur in HMEC upon the addition of TGF-B1 and IFN-y and the withdrawal of EGF ( 18 , 23 , 24 ) .
These results show that the expression level of this set of genes was reduced by a diverse set of growth inhibitory pathways and suggests that this pattern may be linked to cellular proliferation .
Two important processes of many primary human epithelial cells in culture are a reduction in cell proliferation caused by contact inhibition or replicative senescence ( 25 , 26 ) .
The cluster of genes that showed reduced expression after treatment with TGF-B1 , IFN-y , or IFN- « , or after withdrawal of EGF , showed a similar reduction in transcript levels at confluence and senescence ( Fig .
1B ) .
A striking feature of the gene expression patterns seen in the confluent and senescent samples is apparent at the bottom of Fig .
14 .
Under both of these conditions numerous IFN-regulated genes , including ( 2'-5 ' ) oligoadenylate synthetase E , IFN-induced 17KD protein , and STAT1 were induced ( Fig .
1C ) ( 27-29 ) .
The induction of these IFN-regulated genes is known to occur via the JAK/STAT pathway , which when activated , results in the phosphorylation of some of the STAT family member proteins ( 30 ) ; the phosphorylated STAT pro-tein ( s ) then translocates into the nucleus where it directly activates the transcription of target genes , including the STAT1 gene itself ( 29 ) .
Numerous transcriptional targets of this pathway , as well as one of the central regulators ( i.e. , STAT1 ) all were coordinately expressed in this `` IFN- Genetics : Perou et al .
regulated '' cluster .
The response of this set of genes to IFN-a and IFN-y was also very similar to the genes ' response to confluence or senescence ( Fig .
1 4 and C ) .
A simple interpretation of these results is that the induction of these IFN-regulated genes in the confluent and senescent cells was the result of the activation of STAT1 .
The activating STAT1 signal , at confluence and senescence , however , remains unknown .
In addition to the patterns present in Fig .
1 , there were other patterns to be seen in the primary data tables ( which are available at http : //genome-www.stanford.edu/sbemp/ in text/ tab delimited format ) .
Although all of these patterns can be seen in the primary data , many were not represented in Fig .
1 because we selected for the subset of genes whose transcript levels varied 3-fold or more in at least two experiments .
Hence , any gene whose expression varied by less than this magnitude , or was highly expressed in only a single experiment , would not have been included .
Our goal is to use cDNA microarrays as a tool to understand and classify tumors on the basis of their global patterns of gene expression .
To this end , several human breast tumors , tissues , and cell lines were compared , each in turn , to the same HMEC control samples used for the experiments presented in Fig .
1 .
Thirteen grade II-III , grossly dissected , infiltrating ductal carcinomas were collected , and mRNA was prepared from each .
In addition , two normal breast samples ( pools of six and two whole normal breasts ) also were tested .
Finally , three immortal breast-derived cell lines were studied ( MCF7 , ref .
31 ; HB2 , ref .
21 ; and HsS78T , ref.32 ) .
A single clustered image was generated for the 1,247 genes that varied 3-fold or more in three or more of the 26 samples /experiments ( Fig .
2 and Fig .
6 , which is published as supplemental data to this article on the PNAS web site , www.pnas.org ) .
The experimental sample dendrogram above the cluster diagram shows the identity of each column/experiment , with the branching pattern and length of the branches conveying a measure of the relatedness between the samples ( 12 ) .
The microarrays used in this study did not contain all of the genes known to be important for breast cancer biology ; for example , the estrogen receptor and HER2/NEU were notably absent .
Nevertheless , there were still too many clusters of coexpressed genes with obvious relevance to breast cancer biology to discuss here in detail .
We therefore will discuss only a few clusters of genes ( indicated by the black bars in Fig .
2 ) that we considered to be particularly significant .
All of the other clusters , which included a cluster of coexpressed ribosomal protein genes , a cluster of EGF-responsive genes , and a cluster of genes that were highly expressed in normal breast , can be found in Fig .
6 ( see Supplemental data ) .
We recognize as well that important features remain to be found by further exploration of this large data set ( approximately 140,000 independent data points ) .
The `` proliferation cluster '' described in Fig .
1 was recapitulated in this larger experiment ( Figs .
34 , 5 , and 6 ) .
In addition to the previously observed parallel between expression of these genes in vitro and cell proliferation , we observed that this set of genes was highly expressed in the three rapidly growing immortal cell lines , and most significantly , highly expressed in a subset of tumor specimens .
In the tumors , the level of expression of this proliferation-associated cluster showed a range of expression from low levels in BC24 and both normal breast samples ( bright green ) to high expression levels in BC23 ( bright red ) .
A classic histopathological marker that is associated with cell proliferation is the Ki-67 antigen , which is a large protein of unknown function that is expressed at relatively high levels in proliferating cells and at much lower levels in quiescent cells ( 33-35 ) .
To determine whether there was a relationship between the expression levels of genes in the proliferation cluster and the Ki-67 assessment , the percentage of Ki-67-positive carcinoma cells in each tumor section was determined ( Figs .
34 and 4 B , D , F , and H for representative Ki-67 stains ) .

4G ) .
three tumor specimens that showed the highest level of expression of the genes in the proliferation cluster contained 70 % or greater Ki-67-positive carcinoma cells whereas the three tumor specimens with the lowest average expression of these genes showed only 5-10 % Ki-67-positive carcinoma cells .
Thus , although the correlations in detail are imperfect , there is general agreement between the expression level of the genes in the proliferation cluster and a conventional assessment of proliferation of carcinoma cells .
Breast tumor specimens contain other diverse cell types in addition to the carcinoma cells ( 1 ) .
We therefore expected to find gene expression patterns that were contributed by these nonepithelial cell types .
Before discussing these data , it first should be noted that the use of a single cell line ( HMEC ) as a reference made quantitative measurements of gene expression impossible for all those genes not expressed at all in the HMEC reference .
In these cases , the HMEC reference sample 's signal intensity at these spots was very close to zero/ background , whereas the experimental sample 's intensity gave 9216 Genetics : Perou et al .

a significant value .
The net result is that the observed ratio is not an accurate measure of the difference between the two samples , but is instead seen as an arbitrarily large ratio in favor of the experimental sample .
Therefore , only qualitative measurements could be made on these nonepithelial cell type-specific spots/genes .
Nevertheless , this qualitative assessment still permitted the identification of gene expression patterns that were contributed by at least two nonepithelial cell types .
A cluster of genes marked at the bottom of Fig .
2 shows an expression pattern likely to have been contributed by B lymphocytes .
This cluster included three different Ig genes ( lambda heavy , lambda light , and mu chains ) and the generic leukocyte antigen CD45 ( see Fig .
6 ) .
Tumor sections were stained for CD20 , a B-lymphocyte cell surface marker ( 36 ) ; the results showed that the tumors that were positive for Ig mRNAs as determined by cDNA microarray analysis also contained CD20 positive cells ( data not shown ) .
A second nontumor cell type that may be contributing a unique gene expression pattern was tumor-associated stromal cells .
A distinctive cluster of genes that included the extracel-lular matrix proteins collagen type Ia and biglycan were expressed at high levels in all of the tumor specimens , and only in HsS578T among all of the cell lines ( a carcinosarcoma-derived cell line that has stromal cell characteristics ; ref .
32 ) ( see Fig .
6 ) .
The IFN-regulated gene cluster that originally was identified in vitro also was expressed coordinately in many of the tumors ( Fig .
3B ) .
This cluster of genes was highly expressed in some of the tumors ( BC23 ) , moderately expressed in others ( BC14 ) , and apparently silent in others ( BC17 ) .
To identify the cell type ( s ) that was contributing the IFN-regulated pattern , paraffin-embedded tumor sections were stained with antibodies specific for the STAT1 protein .
This protein was chosen because it is a required component of the IFN- « signal transduction pathway ( 20 ) and was expressed coordinately Proc .

Immunohistochemical staining of tumor BC17 , which expressed the genes in this cluster at a very low level , showed no reactivity for the STAT1 protein in any cell type , including lymphocytes ( Fig .
44 ) .
In contrast , tumor BC23 , which had high STAT1 mRNA levels , showed strong and homogenous staining of all tumor cells and many lymphocytes ( Fig .
4C ) .
Specimen BC14 showed a unique pattern of STAT1 staining that could be characterized as a positive staining of some lymphocytes and the most peripheral tumor cells of some tumor cell nests , with the tumor cells in the center of most nests showing little STAT1 reactivity ( Fig .
4E ) .
Finally , a fourth pattern was seen in which only some of the lymphocytes/histiocytes stained positive for STAT1 whereas the carcinoma cells did not ( BC16 and Fig .
4G ) .
DISCUSSION Variation in gene expression reflects important aspects of biological variation in cancers .
Systematic characterization of expression patterns associated with specific cell types , and in response to specific physiological and pathological perturba-tions , provides a framework for interpreting the biological significance of the expression patterns observed in each tumor .
In this study we found features of gene expression patterns in breast cancers that could be related to ( ? )
a complex physiological property ( e.g. , proliferation ) , ( # ) the activity of specific signaling pathways ( e.g. , the IFN-regulated pathway ) , and ( ¥ ) the cellular composition of the tumors ( e.g. , the presence of stromal cells and B lymphocytes ) .
One of our main goals is to use cDNA microarrays to classify breast tumors into categories based on shared gene expression patterns .
The tumor specimens analyzed here could readily be classified based on at least two different gene-expression parameters : expression levels of the genes in the proliferation-associated cluster and the IFN-regulated cluster .
A much larger clinical study will no doubt be required to determine whether expression levels of these , or other sets of genes , can be used as prognostic indicators .
Diverse additional features of variation in gene expression patterns also were seen among the tumor samples ( see primary data tables at http : //genome-www .
stanford.edu/sbemp and Fig .
6 ) ; all of these gene expression features may provide the basis for a more precise molecular taxonomy of breast cancers .
A cluster of IFN-regulated genes was highly expressed in HMEC under three circumstances : addition of IFN , senescence , and confluence .
The latter two suggest that there may be circumstances that activate expression of these genes other than the presence of IFN .
Similarly , we found multiple circumstances in which these genes were expressed in the tumor specimens , some of which may not involve IFNs and may resemble confluence and/or senescence ( BC23 ) .
The role of the STAT family of proteins in breast cell biology is extensive and complex , with numerous STAT proteins playing important roles ( 37-39 ) .
Watson and Miller ( 40 ) have demonstrated the presence of high levels of STAT1 protein in some primary breast tumor nuclear extracts , whereas others have documented high levels of both STAT1 and STAT3 proteins in primary breast tumors ( 41 ) .
We , too , see high levels of STAT3 protein in many of the same tumors that express high levels of STAT1 mRNA and protein ( data not shown ) .
It is not clear at this time what effects the high levels of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins are having on the carcinogenic process , but it is clear that a subset of BCs express the STAT1 protein at relatively high levels , which appears to have resulted in the induction of a known set of IFN-regulated genes .
Breast cancers are complex and highly variable in their histology .
It is not a prior ?
evident that measurements of gene expression based on total mRNA isolated from such a complex tissue can be interpreted in terms of the properties of specific cells ( e.g. , the carcinoma cells ) .
It therefore is noteworthy that Genetics : Perou et al .
discrete gene expression patterns could be identified within a complex mixture of cell types , and that many of these patterns then could be assigned to specific cell types , either by using prior knowledge about the cell type-specific expression of genes within a cluster ( e.g. , Igs ) or by immunohistochemistry using either classical reagents ( e.g. , Ki-67 antibodies ) or antibodies specific for products of genes contained within a cluster ( e.g. , STAT1 ) .
By identifying characteristic clusters of coexpressed genes and then by using antibodies directed against a subset of these genes for immunohistochemistry , archived tumor samples with extensive clinical data can be made accessible to insights derived from gene expression analyses .
We therefore have reason for optimism that clustering analysis of cDNA microarray data can be used generally to study and interpret variation in gene expression in tumors , without prior separation of the constituent cell types .
