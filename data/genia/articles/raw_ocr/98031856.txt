We screened TSGIO1 for somatic mutations in DNA and RNA samples isolated from a variety of common human malignancies , EBV-immortalised B-cells , and normal lung parenchyma .
Intragenic TS8SGI01 deletions in RNA transcripts were frequently found in all types of samples .
Analysis of DNA failed to show genomic rearrangements corresponding to transcripts containing deletions in the same samples .
The breakpoints of most transcript deletions coincide with genuine or cryptic splice site sequences , suggesting that they result from alternative or aberrant splicing .
A similar spectrum of transcript deletions has previously been described in the putative tumour suppressor gene FHZZT .
We analysed FHZT in the same series of RNA samples and detected truncated FHIT transcripts frequently in both tumour and normal tissues .
In addition , transcripts from TSGI01 , FHIT and seven other genes were analysed in RNA isolated from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes .
Large TSGI0 !
and FHIT intragenic transcript deletions were detected and these appeared to be the predominant transcript in 'aged ' lymphocytes .
Similar alterations were not detected in transcripts of the other genes which were analysed .
Our findings demonstrate that truncated TSGI01 and FHIT transcripts are commonly detected in both normal and malignant tissues and that a significant fraction of these are likely to be the result of aberrant splicing .
While we can not exclude that alterations in TSGI01 and FHIT occur during cancer development , our data indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript abnormalities are misleading .
Keywords : TSGI01 ; FHIT ; splicing ; tumour Introduction tsg1I01 is a gene whose functional inactivation transforms mouse fibroblasts to cells that form metastatic tumours in nude mice ( Li and Cohen , 1996 ) .

The human homologue ( TSGI01 ! )
is 86 % identical to mouse tsg101 and consists of an open reading frame ( ORF ) of 1140 bp which is predicted to encode a protein of 380 amino acids ( Li et al. , 1997 ) .
TSGIO1 is localized to chromosome 11p15.1-15.2 , a region at which loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) is frequently observed in breast , ovarian and testicular cancers and in Wilms ' tumour , suggesting that one or more tumour suppressor genes reside in this region ( Li et al. , 1997 ) .
Analysis of RNA derived from breast tumour tissue identified large deletions and insertions within the coding region of TSGI01 in seven of 15 tumours ; these alterations were absent in RNA from matching normal breast tissue ( Li et al. , 1997 ) .
All of these deletions removed part or all of the coiled-coil domain and were predicted to truncate the TSGI01 !
protein .
In addition , 6 tumours which contained deletions in TSGIO !
transcripts appeared also to contain deletions in genomic DNA which had been analysed using a PCR amplification based Southern blot hybridization ( Li et al. , 1997 ) .
The alterations reported in TSGIO !
in primary breast tumours are similar in type to alterations reported in another candidate tumour suppressor gene , FHIT ( Ohta et al. , 1996 ; Sozz et al. , 1996 ) .
The FHIT ( fragile histidine triad ) gene is located at the fragile site locus FRA3B on chromosome 3p14.2 , a region of the genome which shows LOH in a variety of cancers including small cell lung cancers ( SCLC ) and non-small cell lung cancers ( NSCLC ) ( Sozzi et al. , 1996 ) .
FHIT contains an ORF of 444 bp encoding a protein of 147 amino acids , which appears to be ubiquitously expressed in human tissues at low levels .
Large deletions within FHIT transcripts occur frequently in SCLC , NSCLC and carcinomas of the oesophagus , stomach , colon , and breast ( Hayashi et al. , 1997 ; Huebner et al. , 1997 ) .
Most of the deletions described to date in FHIT involve loss of one or more coding exons and are predicted to lead to truncation of the FHIT protein ( Huebner et al. , 1997 ) .
In the current study , we analysed cDNA from normal lymphocytes and lung parenchyma , EBV-immortalised B-cells , and from primary ovarian , breast and lung cancers , chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( CLL ) and ovarian , breast , lung and melanoma cell lines for mutations in TSGIO0 !
and FHIT transcripts .
We also analysed primary ovarian carcino-mas , CLL , and ovarian and lung cancer cell lines for mutations of TSGI01 in genomic DNA .
Aberrant splicing of TSG101 and FHIT SA Gayther et al 2120 Results TSG101 transcript analysis in multiple malignancies and normal tissues cDNA reverse transcribed from RNA prepared from primary tumours , cancer cell lines , and 'normal ' tissues ( lung parenchyma and EBV-immortalised B-cells ) , was used to PCR amplify the entire coding region of TSGIO1 in one fragment to screen for deletions .
The results of this analysis are summarised in Tables 1-3 .
In addition to the normal sized transcript which was observed in the large majority of samples tested , one or more smaller fragments were frequently seen in primary ovarian , breast and lung cancers , in chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( CLL ) , and in breast cancer , ovarian cancer and melanoma cell lines ( Table 1 and Figure la ) .
Although we used a nested PCR approach more than half of the deletions were identified after first round amplification .
The majority of TSGI01 deletions were reproducible in repeat PCR amplifica-tions .
In some tumours shorter transcripts were predominant , and full length TSGIO0 !
was either not detectable or present at low levels ( Table 1 and Figure Table 1 - Frequency of intragenic deletions in TSGIO !

Sequence analysis indicated that these smaller fragments represented TSGIO1 transcripts containing deletions of between 315 and 922 bp ( Figure 1 ; Table 2 ) .
The 5 and/or 3 ' breakpoints of TSGI01 deletions of 506 , 598 , 609 , 815 , 901 and 922 bp were at genuine splice sites or at cryptic splice sites located within exons ( see Table 2 ) .
Most of these deletions are predicted to truncate the TSGIO01 protein and this was confirmed using the protein truncation test ( PTT ) .
We also detected three in-frame deletions of 315 , 609 and 780 bp .
PTT was also used to screen for mutations in TSGIO1 transcripts which did not contain large intragenic deletions .
Alterations such as micro-dele-tions and insertions and nonsense mutations which would be predicted to have the same effect as the larger deletions ( i.e .
to lead to truncation of the protein ) were not detected in any of the samples tested .
Finally , a combination of single strand conformation analysis and heteroduplex analysis ( SSCA/HA ) was used to screen the coding region of the gene for more subtle mutations ; once again no alterations were identified .
We also analysed TSGI01 for transcript deletions in normal tissues .
Intragenic deletions were frequently observed in normal lung parenchyma and EBV transformed lymphocytes ( Table 3 ) .
In all of these samples the full-length TSGIO1 !
transcript was also present .
The spectrum of deletions appears to differ between tumour and normal samples ; the 315 bp in-frame deletion was the most frequently observed alteration in normal tissues and the in-frame deletion of 780 bp was only seen in a normal sample ( Table 2 ) .
However , we also detected the 922 , 901 and 598 bp deletions , which were more frequently seen in tumours , in normal samples .
The spectrum of deletions observed in both tumour and normal tissues is illustrated in Figure 1b and summarised in Table 2 .

( 1 ) PCR primers located in exons 1 and 5 , and flanking breakpoints of three TSGI01 transcript deletions ( 568 , 598 and 901 bp ) , were used in an attempt to amplify the predicted genomic DNA product that would correspond to transcript deletions in ovarian cancer and CLL samples .
We were unable to amplify any genomic DNA product , whereas in a simultaneous control the deleted transcript was amplified from the corresponding cDNA sample using the same primers and PCR conditions .
( 2 ) Genomic DNA , from 47 ovarian tumours and matching bloods , five breast and ovarian cancer cell lines and four CLL samples , were amplified using nested PCR with Aberrant splicing of TSG101 and FHIT SA Gayther et al primers that flank the breakpoints of all of the deletions we identified in RNA transcripts .
Products of amplification were Southern blotted and hybridized with a full-length TSGI01 cDNA probe .
Multiple PCR fragments hybridized .
Six different fragments which hybridized were cloned and sequenced ; five were shown to be amplification artefacts .
The sixth fragment , amplified from a normal sample , represented TSGIO1 related sequence : the sense primer is followed by an additional 11 bp of TSG101 coding sequence before it diverges at nucleotide 132 , the precise location of the 5 breakpoint of deletions of 315 , 506 , 598 and 922 bp .
The sequence at the point of divergence represents a potential consensus splice donor site ( CAAGgt ) , but we have not obtained further evidence that an intron divides exon 1 at nucleotide 132 .
( 3 ) Southern blot hybridization analysis was performed using genomic DNA from 19 ovarian tumours digested with EcoRI and from six ovarian and lung cancer cell lines digested with EcoRI , BamHI and HindIII ; most of these samples had intragenic TSGI01 transcript deletions .

Full length TSG101 is the predominant transcript in samples 1-4 , 7 , 9-11 and 13 .
Full-length TSG1O1 is either absent or at low levels in samples 5 , 6 , 8 and 12 .
Smaller fragments which represent transcripts containing deletions can be seen in samples 3 , 9 and 11 ( deletion of 315 bp ) ; 5 , 6 and 12 ( 901 bp ) ; 8 and 12 ( 568 bp ) .

No evidence of genomic deletion or rearrangement was seen in any samples .
In a recent report , 13 breast cancer cell lines analysed by Southern blot showed no evidence of TSG101 genomic deletion ( Steiner et al. , 1997 ) .
Four of these lines ( BT-20 , T-47D , MCF-7 , MDA-MB-175 ) were analysed in the current study and observed to have the 901 bp transcript deletion .
Finally , to screen for more subtle genomic altera-tions , we used SSCA to analyse the 6 coding exons of TSG101 in genomic DNA from 47 sporadic ovarian tumours and matching lymphocytes .
No deleterious mutations were identified .
Analysis of TSG1IOl transcript deletions in peripheral blood lymphocytes To determine the presence of TSGIO01 truncations in RNA from 'normal ' tissues other than lung parench- TSG101 fresh lymphocytes 'aged ' lymphocytes Igf2 receptor fresh lymphocytes 'aged ' lymphocytes BRCA1 fresh lymphocytes 'aged ' lymphocytes yma and EBV-transformed cell lines , we decided to analyse RNA prepared directly from normal peripheral blood .
Blood was taken from 12 healthy individuals ; approximately half the volume of each sample was prepared immediately for RNA and reverse transcribed into cDNA .
The remainder was incubated at room temperature for 60 h prior to RNA isolation and reverse transcription ( 'aged ' sample ) .
Both sets of cDNA samples were screened simultaneously for deletions in TSGI01 !
transcripts .
Transcripts containing deletions were detected in both fresh and 'aged ' samples .
However , whereas in freshly prepared samples full length TSGIO1 !
was the predominant transcript , 'aged ' samples contained very little full length TSGI01 and a transcript containing a truncating deletion of 506 bp was predominant ( Figure 2a ; Tables 2 and 3 ) .
An identical deletion was also observed in RNA isolated from one lung cancer and from primary breast cancers in the series reported by Lee and Feinberg ( 1997 ) .

TSGI01 !
and FHIT wild-type transcripts are predominant in fresh samples but there is evidence of transcripts with intragenic deletions in some samples .
In RNA samples from 'aged ' lymphocytes full-length TSGI01 and FHIT transcripts are less abundant or completely absent in the majority of samples while the frequency of transcripts with deletions increases significantly .
BRCA1I , BRCA2 , RB , and Igf2 receptor full-length transcripts are amplified consistently in cDNA from both fresh and 'aged ' lymphocytes , with no evidence of intragenic deletions .
In RB and BRCA ! , additional faint bands are occasionally seen ; sequencing of these bands indicates they are artifactual PCR amplification products between exons 2 and 3 .
The specificity of these breakpoints , as well as the results obtained with RT-PCR amplification of other genes , suggest that the 506 bp deletion is the result of alternative aberrant splicing and not degradation of the larger wild-type transcript .
Comparison between TSGIOL transcripts and other gene transcripts To assess whether the difference between RNA prepared from fresh and 'aged ' lymphocytes was a feature of all genes or whether it was specific to TSG1I01 , we analysed the same series of samples for the presence of transcripts deletions in other genes .
Fragments spanning multiple exons were amplified for the genes BRCAI , BRCA2 , BRUSHI , FHIT , hMSH2 , IGF2 receptor , PGDB and RB .
There was no evidence of truncated transcripts containing deletions similar to those observed in TSGI01 !
in any gene except for FHIT ( Figure 2 ) .
FHIT has previously been shown to be frequently altered in a variety of different malignancies ( Huebner et al. , 1997 ) .
The mutation spectrum reported for FHIT , large deletions detected in RNA with breakpoints in the coding region and 5 ' untranslated region of the gene , is similar to that reported for TSGIO1 ! I .
Analysis of fresh and 'aged ' lymphocyte cDNA samples from peripheral blood identified FHIT transcripts shorter than full length transcript in some cases .
As with TSGI01 , these shorter Aberrant splicing of TSG101 and FHIT SA Gayther et al FHIT transcripts were more predominant in 'aged ' samples ( Figure 2b ) .
Sequence analysis of these shorter fragments revealed deletions similar to those previously reported in tumours ( Figure 3b ) .
FHIT deletions occur at the boundaries of splice sites and are predicted to truncate the protein .
Transcripts containing deletions were not observed in any of the other seven genes and in these the integrity of RNA transcripts did not appear to differ between fresh and 'aged ' lymphocytes ( see Figure 2 ) .
Our interpretation of this result is that the fidelity of splicing for the TSGI01 and FHIT genes is affected in 'aged ' lymphocytes .
The 'integrity ' of the transcripts of the seven control genes seems to indicate that RNA degradation is not a trivial explanation of our results .
FHIT transcript analysis in multiple malignancies and normal tissues We also analysed FHIT transcripts for mutations in RNA from multiple malignancies and 'normal ' tissues .
Transcripts containing deletions were frequently detected in all samples analysed ( Figure 3a ; Tables 3 and 4 ) .
The breakpoints of these deletions occurred at the boundaries of introns and exons suggesting that they were the result of aberrant alternative splicing .
The spectrum of deletions observed is illustrated in Figure 3b .

Discussion The data presented in this study show that TSGI0 !
and FHIT transcripts containing deletions can be frequently detected in a variety of different malignancies , but also at similar frequencies in RNA from 'normal ' tissues .
One particular deletion in TSGI01 ( of 901 bp ) which was frequently observed in transcripts in our series of samples is identical to a deletion which was seen in transcripts from four out of seven primary breast cancers in the original report of TSGI01 mutations ( Li et al. , 1997 ) .
Analysis of the sequence flanking this deletion suggests that the boundaries of the breakpoints may represent cryptic consensus splice sites , a splice donor in exon 1 and a splice acceptor in exon 5 .
As we were unable to detect this deletion in genomic DNA , it seems likely that it represents an aberrant splice variant in both malignant and 'normal ' tissues .
Inspection of the sequences flanking the breakpoints of other deletions indicated that in six out of 10 deleted transcripts a genuine or a cryptic splice site is located adjacent to the proximal and/or distal breakpoints of the deletion .
TSGI01 transcripts with deletions of 922 , 598 , 506 and 315 bp share a common proximal breakpoint at nucleotide 132 .
The 315 bp deletion has been reported to be present in an EST ( AA214591 ) from normal human brain ( BLAST search conducted at NCBI ) , and is also seen in normal breast and several different foetal tissues ( Lee and Feinberg , 1997 ) .
Distal breakpoints of deletions of 506 , 598 , 609 , 815 , 901 and 922 bp occur at genuine or cryptic splice acceptor sequences ( Table 2 ) .
It appears , therefore , that aberrant splicing may be the underlying mechanism for most of the truncated transcripts we detected .
Aberrant splicing has also been proposed as a cause of TSGI01 deletions ( of 315 , 506 , 598 and 901 bp ) in RNA transcripts from breast cancer ( Lee and Feinberg , 1997 ) .
Four of ten deletions in transcripts reported in the original description of TSG1O1 mutations in breast cancer are similar to those attributable to alternative and aberrant splicing .
We also identified deletions in which both of the breakpoints of the deletion did not correspond to splice site sequences ( 538 and 780 bp ) ; the mechanism by which these deletions might have occurred is unclear .
Analysis of genomic DNA from primary ovarian cancers , cancer cell lines , CLL and EBV-immortalised B-cells did not show any genomic deletions corre- sponding to transcript deletions in the same samples .
In addition , we did not detect any more subtle mutations in genomic DNA or cDNA using SSCA/ HA and PTT ( in more than 100 samples analysed ) .
Southern blot data obtained by us as well as others is now available from 118 primary breast cancers , 19 primary ovarian cancers , and 19 breast , ovarian and lung cancer cell lines , and to date no TSG101 genomic rearrangements have been seen .
In the present study , truncated FHIT transcripts were frequently detected in all types of malignancy and normal tissues analysed .
Deletions in the coding region of FHIT transcripts have been reported in a variety of cancers including lung , gastric , oesophageal and breast tumours ( Hayashi et al. , 1997 ; Huebner et al. , 1997 ) .
More recently at least two groups have reported deletions in FHIT transcripts from normal tissues , but characterised these as different from deletions present in tumours ( Fong et al. , 1997 ; Luan et al. , 1997 ) .
In contrast , we saw similar types of deletions in both tumour and normal samples .
In all cases the deletion breakpoints are at the boundaries of exons and introns ( see Figure 3b ) , supporting the contention that they probably result from aberrant splicing .
Aberrant splicing has been previously described for other cancer-associated genes , namely p53 , MLL and hMSH2 ( Flaman et al. , 1996 ; Lochner et al. , 1996 ; Nam et al. , 1996 ) , but not to the extent that we are now reporting for TSGIO1 !
and FHIT .
One possible explanation for the observations in TSGI01 !
and FHIT is that the mechanisms involved in the control of RNA splicing have been disrupted , but whatever causes this disruption appears not to be specific for cancer cells .
Importantly , mis-splicing was not observed in normal peripheral blood samples in seven other genes , BRCAL ! , BRCA2 , BRUSH1 , hMSH2 , IGF2 receptor , PGDB and RB , indicating that this is not a generalized phenom-enon .
Lee and Feinberg ( 1997 ) in their report quantitated the aberrant TSG1O01 transcripts and showed that in cancer cells they represent a large percentage of the RT-PCR products and in normal cells 3-4 % of RNA .
It seems therefore unlikely that the aberrant transcripts are the result of some experimental artefact .
In conclusion , these data strongly suggest that most of the truncations observed in TSGIO1 and FHIT transcripts result from alternative and aberrant splicing events .
It remains to be seen whether truncated TSGIO1 and FHIT transcripts are important in tumour progression in a wide variety of malignancies or whether these truncations are merely the consequence of altered mRNA splicing fidelity that occurs more commonly in tumour cells .
In the case of FHIT , FISH and Southern blot analysis have shown that in some tumours and cell lines the same exons that are missing from the truncated transcripts appear to be deleted in genomic DNA ( Druck et al. , 1997 ; Virgilio et al. , 1996 ) .
Despite this , it has not been possible to clone any of the putative genomic breakpoints and so the evidence that FHIT is the real target of the genomic deletions seen at the fragile site locus that encompasses this gene is lacking .
A similar scenario appears to be emerging for TSGIO1 ; a variety of transcript deletions are frequently detected but as yet there is no direct evidence that genomic deletions correspond to these aberrant transcripts .
Materials and methods Patient material and cancer cell lines EBV-transformed B-cells were derived from individuals ( both affected and unaffected ) from breast and ovarian cancer families .
All tissue samples were snap frozen upon collection and stored at -80°C ; cancer cell lines and EBV transformed lymphocytes were grown to confluence ; peripheral blood samples drawn from 12 healthy individuals were collected in EDTA .
The names of cell lines obtained commercially ( breast , ovarian and lung cancer ) and used in this study are available on request ( email : sg200 @ cam.ac.uk ) RNA extraction Total RNA extraction was performed using either TRIzol '' '' ( Life Technologies ) or Purescript ' '' ( Gentra Systems , Inc. ) in primary ovarian , breast and non-small cell lung cancers , ovarian , breast and lung cancer cell lines , low-passage melanoma cell lines , chronic lymphocytic leukaemias ( CLL ) , EBV-immortalized cell lines and normal lung parenchyma .

All RT reactions included a tube with no added RT as a negative control .
Primers located in 5 and 3 ' untranslated sequences were used to amplify the entire coding region of TSGI01 using single round ( 35-40 cycles ) or nested PCR ( 15-20 cycles ) and size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis .
Primers used for nested PCR were the same as those used for the PTT assay .

All PCR experiments were done with a template-negative tube as control .
PCR fragments were purified from 2 % low melting point ( LMP ) agarose and reamplified for direct sequencing .
Sequence analysis was performed using the ABI 373 semi-automated DNA sequencer and dye terminator cycle sequencing with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase , FS ( Perkin Elmer ) .
The protein truncation test ( PTT ) was performed as previously described ( Gayther et a/. , 1997 ) using a sense primer incorporating a T7 promoter sequence .
Single strand Aberrant splicing of TSG101 and FHIT SA Gayther et al conformation analysis analysis ( SSCA/HA ) was performed using MDE ( Flowgen ) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described ( Gayther et al. , 1997 ) .
Analysis of genomic DNA Oligonucleotide primers located within exons 1 and 5 and flanking the breakpoints of three TSGIO !
transcript deletions ( nucl .
568-1113 ( 568 bp ) ; 133-730 ( 598 bp ) ; 154-1054 ( 901 bp ) ) were used to try to amplify the products of the deletions from genomic DNA of primary tumours , cancer cell lines and normal tissue .
PCR-Southern blot analysis was performed using genomic DNA from 47 ovarian tumours and matching blood samples , five breast and ovarian cancer cell lines and from four CLL samples .
Nested PCR using pairs of primers located in exonic and intronic sequences and which flank the breakpoints of all the deletions we detected , were used to try to amplify fragments between exon 1 and exon 5 .
PCR products were Southern blotted ( Hybond N* , Amersham ) and hybridized with a P-labelled full length cDNA probe .
Fragments which hybridized to TSG101 were purified from 2 % LMP agarose gels , cloned using the TA cloning system ( Invitrogen ) and sequenced as described above .
Southern blot hybridization was performed using genomic DNA from 19 primary ovarian tumours digested with EcoRI and from six ovarian and lung cancer cell lines digested with EcoRI , BamHI and HindIII .
Between 5 and 10 ug of DNA were digested overnight prior to Southern blotting and hybridization with a full length cDNA probe .
SSCA/HA was used to screen all six coding exons of TSGIO1 from genomic DNA from 47 sporadic ovarian tumour-blood pairs , as previously described ( Gayther et a/. , 1997 ) .
Analysis of mRNA transcripts from multiple genes in normal peripheral blood cDNA reverse transcribed from RNA isolated from fresh and incubated blood samples from 12 healthy individuals ( see above ) was used to amplify partial or complete transcripts from BRCA !
( exons 17-22 ) , BRCA2 ( exons 3-10 ) , BRUSHI , FHIT , IGF2 receptor , PGDB , TSG101 , hMSH2 and RB .
TSG101 analysis is described above .
The primers used for FHIT analysis have been described previously .
BRCAI , BRCA2 , hMSH2 , TSG101 and FHIT were analysed using nested PCR ; BRUSH 1 , IGF2 receptor , PGDB , and RB were amplified using a single round of PCR .
All primer sequences are available on request ( email : sg200 @ cam.ac.uk ) .
FHIT was analysed also for intragenic deletions in RNA from primary tumours and/or cell lines from ovarian , breast and lung cancers , melanomas and chronic lymphocytic leukaemias ( CLL ) , from EBV-immortalized B-cells and normal lung parenchyma ( Tables 3 and 4 ) .
