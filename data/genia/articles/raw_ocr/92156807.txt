The AP-1 Site at -150 bp , but Not the NF- « B Site , Is Likely to Represent the Major Target of Protein Kinase C in the Interleukin 2 Promoter By Jugnu Jain , '' Viia E. Valge-Archer , '' f Anthony J. Sinskey , t and Anjana Rao* From the *Division of Tumor Virology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , and the Department of Pathology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 ; and the tDepartment of Biology , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 Summary Stimulation of T cells with antigen results in activation of several kinases , including protein kinase C ( PKC ) , that may mediate the later induction of activation-related genes .
We have examined the potential role of PKC in induction of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene in T cells stimulated through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex .
We have previously shown that prolonged treatment of the untransformed T cell clone Ar-5 with phorbol esters results in downmodulation of the a and isozymes of PKC , and abrogates induction of II-2 mRNA and protein .
Here we show that phorbol ester treatment also abolishes induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in Ar-5 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter linked to this reporter gene .
The IL-2 promoter contains binding sites for nuclear factors including NFAT-1 , Oct , NF-B , and AP-1 , which are all potentially sensitive to activation of PKC .
We show that induction of a trimer of the NFAT and Oct sites is not sensitive to phorbol ester treatment , and that mutations in the NF-KB site have no effect on inducibility of the II > 2 promoter .
In contrast , mutations in the AP-1 site located at -150 bp almost completely abrogate induction of the IL-2 promoter , and appearance of an inducible nuclear factor binding to this site is sensitive to PKC depletion .
Moreover , cotransfections with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly enhance induction of the IL-2 promoter in minimally stimulated T cells .
Our results indicate that the AP-1 site at -150 bp represents a major , if not the only , site of PKC responsiveness in the IL-2 promoter .
Stimulation of T lymphocytes by antigen results in the activation of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases , and later in induction of a large number of activation-associated genes ( reviewed in references 1-3 ) .
One of the best characterized of the kinases is protein kinase C ( PKC ) , a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that are activated as a consequence of increased phosphatidylinositol turnover in stimulated T cells ( reviewed in references 4 and 5 ) .
Gene induction in activated T cells is at least partly mediated by PKC , since phorbol esters ( alone or in combination with calcium ionophores ) can activate PKC and gene expression in parallel ( reviewed in references 3 and 6 ) .
In fact , phorbol esters induce a variety of transcription factors that are capable of binding to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of phorbol ester-inducible genes .
Among these is the AP-1 ( Fos/Jun ) transcription factor , which is newly synthesized as well as posttranslationally modified in phorbol ester-stimu- 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; PKC , protein kinase C ; hGH , human growth hormone .
lated cells ( 7 , 8 ) , and the NF-KB transcription factor , which is released from a preexisting cytosolic complex with an in-hibitory protein upon phorbol ester treatment ( 9 ) .
The gene for the lymphokine IL-2 , a growth factor for T and B cells , is induced within 1-6 h after TCR stimulation ( 10 , 11 ) , and represents a good model system for investigating the relation between PKC activation and lymphokine gene induction in T cells .
The sites relevant for induction of the IL-2 promoter have been exhaustively mapped .
Both constitutive ( Oct ) and inducible ( NFAT-1 , NF- « B , AP-1 , and CD28RC ) DNA binding factors have been implicated in induction ( 11-19 ) .
Each of these inducible factors can be induced by phorbol esters and/or calcium ionophores in T cells and other cell types , suggesting the potential involvement of PKC and/or calcium-dependent kinases .
Moreover the induction of c-Fos , a component of the AP-1 family of transcription factors ( 7 ) , is PKC dependent in T cells ( 20 ) .
By itself , the use of phorbol esters has not been sufficient to prove the involvement of PKC , since the activity of several other kinases and enzymatic processes can be secondarily regu- 853 J. Exp .

In fact the changes in phosphorylation of c-Jun in phorbol ester-stimulated fibroblasts can not be replicated in vitro with purified PKC ( 8 ) .
Experiments with PKC inhibitors have also been equivocal , since few inhibitors are entirely selective for PKC , and most are toxic to untransformed cells at concentrations approaching those required for complete inhibition of kinase activity ( 22 ) .
An alternative method for assessing the involvement of PKC has relied on downmodulation of certain PKC isozymes by prolonged treatment with high concentrations of phorbol esters ( 23 ) , a technique that works particularly well in untransformed cells with low biosynthetic rates .
The mechanism of downmodulation is apparently through recruitment of essentially all the enzyme to the plasma membrane , where it is rapidly degraded by a protease ( 24 , 25 ) .
Although untransformed cells treated in this manner show an initial acute response to the phorbol ester , this response fades rapidly .
After 36-48 h , the treated cells appear similar to quiescent , untreated T cells in their growth rates , basal levels of cellular kinase activity , and expression of activation-associated genes ( 20 , 26 ) .
In murine thymocytes , Western blotting with isozyme-specific antibodies indicates that the & and 3 PKC isozymes are downmodulated by chronic phorbol ester treatment , and expression of the e isozyme is unaffected ( 27 ) .
Depletion of the x and 3 isozymes by phorbol ester treatment has been confirmed by direct measurements of PKC activity in untransformed murine T cell clones ( 20 , 26 ) .
The residual e isozyme was not detected since it does not efficiently phos-phorylate the histone substrate used in the standard assays for PKC ( 28 ) .
T cells chronically treated with phorbol esters , and thus depleted for the ax and B PKC isozymes , show no gene induction or lymphokine secretion in response to TCR ligands ( 20 , 26 ) , suggesting that these downmodulated isozymes are required for signal transduction through the TCR .
A less likely explanation is that chronic phorbol ester treatment affects an unrelated process that is independently required for gene induction and lymphokine secretion in activated T cells .
We have used the untransformed , antigen-responsive T cell clone Ar-5 ( 20 , 29 , 30 ) to identify the PKC-sensitive sites in the IL-2 gene promoter .
Ar-5 cells show low constitutive but strong inducible expression of nuclear factors that bind to sites in the IL-2 promoter .
Moreover , induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activity in Ar-5 cells transfected with an IL-2 promoter-CAT plasmid , and then activated through the TCR , is completely suppressed by chronic phorbol ester treatment , thus implicating the & and B isozymes of PKC in IL-2 gene induction and facilitating the identification of potentially PKC-sensitive mechanisms for IL-2 gene induction .
We show that a major locus of PKC responsiveness in the IL-2 promoter is likely to be the AP-1 site located at -150 bp upstream of the transcription start site .
Analysis of promoter mutations indicates that an intact NF-KB site is not required for II > 2 gene induction in Ar-5 T cells .
Materials and Methods Plasmids .
- The haman 5 IL-2-CAT plasmid ( obtained from G. Crabtree , Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) contains 635 bp of the human IL-2 promoter linked to the CAT gene and SV40 poly ( A ) tail as described ( 31 ) .
The murine 5'IL-2-CAT plasmids pIL-CATO , pIL-CAT2/1* , and pILCAT2/1-M ( obtained from E. Serfling , Universitit Wiirzburg , Wiirzburg , Germany ) contain -2000 to -7 bp , -293 to -7 bp , and -293 to -200 bp region , respectively , of the murine IL-2 promoter linked to the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( tk ) promoter placed upstream of the CAT gene in the plasmid pBLCAT2 ( 14 ) .
The three human 5 ' IL-2-CAT plasmids bearing mutations in the IL-2 « B site ( obtained from M. Siekevitz , Mount Sinai Medical Center , New York , NY ) were as described previously ( 13 ) .
The four mutants in the -150 and -180 bp AP-1 sites were constructed in the human 5 ' IL-2-CAT plasmid ( 30 , 31 ) using uracil-labeled template DNA , as described ( 32 ) .
Mutated plasmids were selected by colony hybridizations using the mutagenic oligonucleotide , and their identity was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing ( 33 ) .
The oligonucleotides used for the site-directed mutagenesis of the AP-1 sites were : M1 : 5CAAAGACTGACTTTATGGTA , M2 : 5CAAAGGGTGACT GAATGGAT , M3 : 5 '' TCTGATGACTCGAGGGAATT , and M4 : 5 '' TCTGATGTTGCTTTGGAATT .
The expression plasmids BK28 ( human c-Fos , [ 34 ] ) and pRSV-cJ ( human c-Jun , [ 35 ] ) were used for cotransfections .
The control plasmids that lacked the c-Fos and c-Jun coding sequences , but possessed the FBJ-MSV proviral LTR and the RSV LTR , respectively , were kindly provided by Dr. E. Flemington , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA .
Transfections .
- The murine T cell clone Ar-5 was cultured in `` T cell medium , '' consisting of DMEM containing 10 % FCS and rat T cell growth factor ( CR-fFCGF , Collaborative Research Inc. , Lex-ington , MA ) as a source of IL-2 , and other additives , as described previously ( 29 , 30 , 36 ) .
For PKC depletion , cells were treated with 200 nM PMA for 2 d before transfection , and 200 nM PMA was included in the culture medium until the cells were harvested .
For transfections , untreated or PMA-treated cells ( 2-3 x 10 '' ) were harvested in log phase growth ( ~5 x 10° cells/ml ) , incubated with 10-15 ug of DNA and 100 ug/ml DEAE-dextran in 2 ml DMEM for 30 min at 37°C , and split equally into two flasks containing 10 ml of T cell medium and coated with rabbit anti-hamster antibodies , if appropriate .
The transfected cells were activated the next day , harvested 24 h later , and assayed for CAT activity , as described ( 37 ) .
The conversion of `` C-chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms was quantified using a Betagen Betascope ( Waltham , MA ) .
To control for the increase in protein synthesis in activated cells , the protein concentration of cell extracts was measured according to Bradford ( 38 ) and used to normalize the measured CAT activity .
In addition , the plasmid pRSVCAT ( 37 ) was used as a standard for transfection efficiency of the cells in each experiment ( 30 ) .
The enhancerless plasmid pBL-CAT 2 ( 39 ) was not inducible in transfections and exhibited very low basal transcriptional activity .
The stimuli used for activation were antigen ( arsonate-conjugated OVA , 100 ug/ml ) with 2 x 10° TA3 APC ( 29 , 36 ) , anti-CD3e ( 1 % 145-2C11 hybridoma supernatant [ 40 ] ) crosslinked either via Fc receptors on 2 x 10° TA3 cells or on flasks coated with 300 ug/tl rabbit anti-hamster antibody ( Cappel Laboratories , Cochran-ville , PA ) , or 10-nM PMA plus 100 nM ionomycin .
Activation was monitored in all experiments by measuring proliferation or IL-2 secretion ( 20 , 36 ) .
We have noticed that transfected Ar-5 cells stimulated with TA3 cells and antigen or anti-CD3¢e show consistently lower induction of IL-2-CAT activity than cells stimulated with 854 AP-1 and NFKB Sites in the Interleukin 2 Promoter anti-CD3¢ that have been crosslinked using immobilized second antibody , possibly because the latter stimulus is capable of cross-linking a larger proportion of surface TCR/CD3 complexes .
Nevertheless , all three stimuli yield qualitatively very similar results .
For most experiments , the use of anti-CD3 crosslinked with second antibody was preferred , because it monitors activation solely through the TCR/CD3 complex , uncomplicated by interactions involving other cell-surface receptors such as CD28 ( 19 ) .
The quality of the plasmid DNAs used for transfections was monitored by checking them all for equivalent content of super-coiled DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis , and by cotransfecting them with an RSV-hGH ( human growth hormone ) internal control plasmid and monitoring hGH activity in supernatants and extracts of unstimulated cells as described ( 41 ) .
Values for intracel-lular growth hormone ranged from 3 to 11 ng/2 x 10 '' cells 48 h after transfection , and values of secreted hGH ranged from 1.85 to 5.1 ng/2 x 10 '' cells .
At least three independent DNA preparations were tested for each plasmid .
Relative to the wild-type human 5 IL-2-CAT plasmid ( set to 100 % ) , the transfection efficiency of the IL-2 xB mutants was as follows : M1 ( 80.1 % ) , M4 ( 62.1 % ) , and M5 ( 60.9 % ) .
Similarly , relative to the wild-type human 5 ' IL2-CAT plasmid ( set to 100 % ) , the transfection efficiency of the AP-1 mutants monitored by this assay was as follows : M1 ( 92.6 % ) , M2 ( 131.4 % ) , M3 ( 265.4 % ) , and M4 ( 123.4 % ) .
Cotransfection with internal control plasmids could not be performed in our experiments , since all the internal control plasmids that we have tested were induced in activated T cells , and since induction of the CAT plasmids was decreased when internal control plasmids were cotrans-fected , apparently because of competition between the CAT plasmids and the internal control plasmids for relevant transcription factors .
These problems are likely to reflect lower resting , as well as lower inducible levels of transcription factors in untransformed T cell clones , compared with the transformed T cells previously used for studies of II-2 promoter activation ( JURKAT , EL-4 , and LBRM-33 [ 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 ] ) .

The oligonucleotides were endlabeled with y [ `` °P ] -ATP and polynucleotide kinase ( 33 ) and purified on 12 % acrylamide gels .
Small-scale nuclear extracts were made from 2 x 10 '' unactivated or activated Ar-5 cells by a modification of the method of Dignam ( 44 ) .
Unless otherwise stated , cells were activated for 2 h with anti-CD3e antibody which was crosslinked using immobilized second antibody .
For each binding reaction , 10,000 cpm ( ~0.2-0.5 ng ) of endlabeled probe was incubated with 5-8-ug nuclear extract in the presence of 3 ug sheared poly ( dI-dC ) .
The binding reaction was performed for 5-10 min ( AP-1 ) , or 15-20 min ( NFAT-1 and IL-2 « B ) at room temperature .
The resulting complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis at room temperature on 4 % acrylamide gels ( 33 ) .
Results and Discussion Induction of the IL-2 Promoter Is Sensitive to Chronic Phorbol Ester Treatment .
- The antigen-responsive murine T cell clone Ar-5 ( 29 ) was left untreated or depleted of PKC by prolonged treatment with a high concentration of PMA ( 200 nM for 48 h ) .
As mentioned previously , this treatment results in selective degradation of the & and 3 isozymes of PKC , but not the e isozyme in murine thymocytes ( 27 ) , and abrogates induction of IL-2 mRNA in Ar-5 cells ( 20 ) .
Untreated and PMA-treated cells were transfected with plasmids containing the 5 ' sequences of either the human or murine IL-2 promoters linked to the CAT reporter gene ( 14 , 31 } .

The cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity 18-24 h later ( 37 ) .
Both human and murine 5 '' IL-2-CAT constructs were induced three-fivefold after activation of Ar-5 cells by TA3 cells and antigen or anti-CD3 ( Fig .
1 b , left and center ) .
No induction was seen if the cells were depleted of PKC by phorbol ester treatment ( Fig .
1 b , left and center ) .
This was expected since IL-2 mRNA and protein are not induced after chronic phorbol ester treatment ( 20 ) .
The plasmid pRSVCAT , which is constitutively expressed , was used as a control for transfection efficiency and was equivalently expressed in untreated and PMA-pretreated cells ( see Fig .
2 ) .
The PMA-pretreated cells did not proliferate in response to PMA and ionomycin nor to anti-CD3¢ antibody , confirming that they were depleted of the relevant ( a and 3 ) PKC isozymes ( data not shown ) .
24 Induction of an NFAT/Oct Trimer Is Insensitive to Chronic Phorbol Ester Treatment .
- The human and mouse IL > 2 promoters share binding sites for several known transcription factors in the region extending ~300 bases upstream of the transcription start site ( see Fig .
1 a ) .
This region contains sites for the nuclear factors NFAT-1 , Oct-1/Oct-2 , NF-KB , CD28RC , and AP-1 ( 11-19 ) .
NFAT , AP-1 , and NF- « B binding activities have been shown to be induced by phorbol esters and/or calcium ionophores in T cells ( JURKAT [ 12 , 13 ] and EL4 cells [ 14 ] ) , and in other cell types ( 7 , 45 , 46 ) , implicating PKC and/or calcium dependent kinases in their activation .
To determine whether the NFAT-1 and Oct sites contributed to the PKC responsiveness of the IL-2 promoter , we transfected a CAT plasmid ( pIL-CAT2/1-M ; [ 14 ] ) containing a trimer of the murine NFAT-1/Oct site ( -293 to -200 bp relative to the transcription start site ) into untreated and phorbol ester-treated Ar-5 cells ( Fig .
1 b , right ) .
The NFAT 1/Oct construct was induced strongly under both conditions 856 AP-1 and NFKB Sites in the Interleukin 2 Promoter AGGGATTTCAC GG @ G @ aGaCcTTTCC Labelled probe : IL2 kB Competitors : lg kB 5 ' Mut ATTC 3 ' Mut GAA Induced ae o won suse . » : None Self Ig kB _ 5'¢ Mut _ 3 ' Mut 20 40 20 40 20 40 20 40 * , 1 ( Fig .
1 , b , right ) .
Although this experiment does not distinguish between the individual contributions of NFAT-1 and Oct sites , it is clear that downmodulation of PKC activity ( or any other effect of chronic PMA pretreatment ) does not compromise their enhancer function in Ar-5 cells .
Likewise , phorbol ester treatment did not affect the induction of a protein complex that bound specifically to the NFAT-1 site in gel-shift assays ( see Fig .
3 b , lanes 9-12 ) .
The lack of effect of PKC depletion on induction of the NFAT-1 site trimer , and on appearance of NFAT-1 binding activity in a gel-shift assay , is consistent with the suggestion that calcium-dependent processes may be involved in the activation of NFAT-1 ( 18 ) .
However PKC isozymes ( such as the e isozyme ) that are not downmodulated by chronic phorbol ester treatment might also be involved ( 27 ) .
Mutations in the NF-KB Site Do Not Decrease IL-2 Promoter Induction .
- These experiments suggested that the NFAT and Oct sites were not PKC responsive ( as defined by their insensitivity to chronic phorbol ester treatment ) , and hence that 857 Jain et al .

- Induction of the IL-2 promoter is unaffected by mutations of the « B site that abolish NF- « B binding .

Cells were either unstimulated ( lanes 1-3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , and 17 ) or stimulated with anti-CD3¢ crosslinked with immobilized second antibody ( lanes 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , and 18 ) .

Two likely candidates were the NFKB and AP-1 sites ( Fig .
1 a ) , which can bind purified NF-kB and AP-1 proteins as well as PMA-inducible nuclear factors from activated T cells in vitro ( 13 , 14 , 42 , 47 ) .
We used site-specific mutants to determine the importance of the NF-KB site in IL-2 promoter induction .
Three 5 ' IL-2-CAT plasmids derived from mutations in the NF-KB site of the human IL-2 gene ( 13 ) ( Fig .
2 a , top ) were transfected into Ar-5 cells .
All three mutant promoters ( Fig .
2 a , lanes 7 , 8 ; 11 , 12 ; and 15 and 16 ) could be activated at least as well as the wild-type promoter ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The lack of effect of mutations in the site was not due to any differences in the ability of the plasmids to be transfected as determined by the internal controls ( see Materials and Methods ) .
In fact , mutants M4 and MS ( lanes 11 , 12 ; and 15 , 16 ) consistently showed two to fourfold higher induction than the wild-type promoter ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , despite being lower in transfection efficiency .
This suggests that perhaps the IL-2 NF-KB site is a target 8 __ __ € 8 1soap4 __ & ATCCAEQAGTCAECTTTGGGGGTWAMGAMTTCCﬁAGﬁ ' CATCAGA AA CC CTC CAA M1 M2 M3 - M4 pRSVCAT _ Human S'IL2-CAT M1 M2 M3 M4 ___ _ X-linked acos ____________j Fold induction 84.7 63.2 57.7 2.3 4.2 * *e * -150 AP-1 MT AP-1 NFAT-1 -o- ot oB c- o- o $ o $ o- - + + PMA pretreatment Woo , auath # - .

for negative regulation in Ar-5 cells .
In contrast , the same NF- « B mutations have been reported to decrease induction in PHA/PMA-stimulated JURKAT cells by as much as 80 % ( 13 ) .
This discrepancy may reflect a difference between primary and transformed T cells .
Alternatively , stimulation via PMA and PHA may not physiologically mimic activation by antigen or antibodies to the TCR/CD3 complex .
Nevertheless , Ar-5 cells and JURKAT cells are unlikely to have completely different requirements for IL-2 promoter activation , since a mutant promoter with an internal deletion encompassing the NF-KB site was induced as well as the wild-type IL2 promoter in PHA/PMA-stimulated JURKAT cells 12 , 48 ) .
( Like ) induction of the wild-type promoter , induction of the IL-2 « B site mutants was also abrogated by PMA pretreatment ( Fig .
2 a , lanes 5 , 6 ; 9 , 10 ; 13 , 14 ; and 17 , 18 ) .
This result confirms that the NF-KB site does not represent the PKC-responsive site in the IL-2 promoter .
The IL-2 « B site binds purified NF-KB in vitro with ~10-fold lower affinity than the Ig « B site ( 49 ) , and its activity in vivo may be further reduced or modified by interactions with other nuclear factors ( 47 , 50 ) ; thus , it is not surprising that it appears non-functional in our assays .
Although mutations in the NF-KB site did not alter the induction of IL-2-CAT activity , we detected binding of an inducible nuclear factor to the NF-KB site in gel-shift assays ( Fig .
2 b ) .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the murine IL-2 « B site ( -210 to -186 bp ) was labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from Ar-5 cells that were either unstimulated or stimulated with crosslinked anti-CD3e .
Two specific retarded bands were observed with nuclear extracts from stimulated , but not unstimulated cells ( Fig .
2 b , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The upper band migrated with the same mobility as the retarded bands seen with a labeled ( Ig ) k enhancer « B probe ( data not shown ) .
The lower and fainter band appeared variably and may result from proteolytic degradation of the upper band .
The binding was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the labeled IL-2 « B probe ( Fig .

2 b , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Ig « B oligonucleotides containing mutations in the 5 invariant GGG ( similar to the M1 mutation in IL-2 « B , lanes 7 and 8 `` 5 ' Mut '' ) or in the 3 ' TTCC ( similar to the M4 mutation in IL-2 « B , lanes 9 and 10 , `` 3 ' Mut '' ) failed to compete for binding ( Fig .
2 5 ) .
The factor therefore , behaved as predicted for authentic NF-KB ( 13 , 42 ) .
The discrepancy between the binding seen in the gel-shift experiments and the lack of effect in transfection assays emphasizes the importance of corroborating in vitro binding analyses with experiments performed in vivo .
Mutations in the Downstream APA Site Abrogate IL-2 Promoter Induction .
- We also investigated the role of both AP-1 sites in induction of the IL-2 promoter .
Two AP-1 sites have been identified by deletion and footprinting analysis at ~150 and -180 bp upstream of the transcription start site ( 12 , 14 , 15 , 30 ) ( Figs .
1 a and 3 a ) .
The upstream AP-1 site at -180 bp is not detected by footprinting of EL-4 nuclear extracts 859 Jain et al .
( 14 ) , and deletion of the site does not affect induction of the IL-2 promoter in JURK AT cells ( 12 ) .
However , this site has been implicated in the synergistic response to IL-1 of LBRM-33 cells ( 16 ) .
By contrast , deletion of the downstream AP-1 site at -150 bp decreases induction to 11 % of the wild-type level in JURKAT cells , and to 27 % of the wild-type level in EL-4 cells ( 12 , 14 ) .
This site binds inducible nuclear proteins from EI ; 4 cells , and has a higher affinity for purified AP-1 proteins than the -180 bp site ( 14 ) .
We made site-specific mutations in both AP-1 sites and transfected the mutants into Ar-5 cells ( Fig .
3 , a and b ) .
Both mutations in the downstream ( -150 bp ) AP-1 site significantly decreased IL-2 promoter activity in transfection experiments .
Mutant M3 , bearing a triple base mutation ( AAA to CTC ) showed a ~95 % decrease in the induction of CAT activity in response to crosslinked anti-CD3e ( Fig .
3 a , bottom ) , and a 60-80 % decrease in response to TA3 cells and anti-CD3e or PMA and ionomycin ( data not shown ) .
If normalized with respect to wild-type plasmid for transfection efficiency , induction of the mutant M3 promoter would be decreased by two to threefold further ( see normalized hGH values in Materials and Methods ) .
Mutant M4 , which also bears a triple mutation ( AGT to CAA ) showed no response at all to any stimulus tested ( > 95 % decrease , Fig .
3 a , bottom , and data not shown ) , although the plasmid was transfected better than the wild-type .
In contrast the M1 and M2 mutations in the upstream AP-1 site only partly decreased induction in response to these various stimuli ( 25-65 % decrease , Fig .
3 a , bottom , and data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the downstream AP-1 site is absolutely required for induction of the IL-2 promoter in response to TCR stimuli .
The upstream site , although not critical , may enhance activation in vivo .
Our mutations monitor the AP-1 site at -150 bp rather than the CD28-responsive site that is located immediately upstream ( 19 ) , since they abrogate induction of CAT activity in cells stimulated with crosslinked anti-CD3 in the complete absence of accessory cells that might express ligands for CD28 .
We performed gel-shift assays to determine if either AP-1 site was capable of binding in a PKC-sensitive manner to inducible nuclear factors in vitro .
Radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to either AP-1 site were incubated with nuclear extracts from stimulated or unstimulated Ar-5 cells .
The -180 AP-1 site probe failed to bind any strongly inducible protein ( data not shown ) .
These results are in contrast to those reported for LBRM cells ( 16 ) , and may reflect the inability of H1 to enhance IL-2 gene induction in Ar-5 cells ( Jain , J. , and A. Rao , unpublished results ) .
In contrast , the oligonucleotide corresponding to the -150 AP-1 site bound to a nuclear factor found only in activated Ar-5 cells ( Fig .
3 b , lanes 1 and 2 ) ; an inducible factor of identical mobility bound to an oligonucleotide containing the metallothionein AP-1 site ( Fig .
3 b , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
The factor was identified as Fos or a Fos-related protein ( 30 ) .
It was detectable at 30 min after activation and was maximally induced at 1-2 h , as expected if the rapidly inducible Fos family members were involved .
Its migration was altered by affinity-purified anti 44x 6 C 5 } 6 5 I & 4 } B O ] e 3 ) CG 4 & 2 } 1 S Imon ous controls c-fos c-jun c-fos + c-jun plasmids 2 ) medium soluble aCD3 BJ xtinked aCD3 Figure 4 .
Induction of the IL-2 promoter is augmented by expression of c-Fos and c-Jun .
Ar-5 cells were cotransfected with 2.5 ug of the human 5 ' IL-2-CAT plasmid and 2.5 pg each of the human c-Fos , c-Jun , or control expression plasmids .
The cells were activated with 1 % anti-CD3 , either soluble ( hatched bars ) , or crosslinked with immobilized second antibody ( solid bars ) .
One representative experiment , of three similar ones , is shown .
bodies to the Fos M peptide ( 51 ) that were capable of im-munoprecipitating c-Fos and related proteins .
Its binding was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the downstream AP-1 site or the metallothionein AP-1 site , but not by oligonucleotides containing the IL-2 « B site or the M1 , M2 , M3 , or M4 mutations in the AP-1 sites ( 30 ) .
Induction of the AP-1 factor in Ar-5 cells was sensitive to PKC depletion by chronic phorbol ester treatment ( Fig .
3 b ; compare lanes 2 and 4 with 6 and 8 ) , although there was no effect on induction of NFAT-1 in the same experiment ( Fig .
3 6 , lanes 9-12 ) .
Cotransfection with c-Fos and c-Jun Expression Plasmids Increases IL-2 Promoter Induction .
_ Fos-Jun complexes are induced after TCR/CD3-mediated activation ( 16 , 20 ) and bind to AP-1 sites in vitro ( 7 ) .
We tested the ability of c-Fos and c-Jun expression plasmids to enhance the induction of IL- 2-CAT activity in transient cotransfections ( Fig .
4 ) .
As high concentrations of plasmid DNA ( > 10 pug ) inhibit transfection efficiency in these cells ( Valge-Archer , V. E. , and A. Rao , unpublished results ) , the amount of IL-2-CAT plasmid transfected was decreased by the amount of c-Fos , c-Jun , or con trol plasmids used .
Under these conditions , the IL2-CAT plasmid cotransfected with control plasmids for c-Fos and c-Jun was weakly induced by crosslinked anti-CD3¢ ( 4.3-fold in this experiment ) , presumably because the FBJ-MSV and RSV LTRs present in the control plasmids competed for binding of transcription factors also required for IL-2 promoter induction ( see Materials and Methods } .
Cotransfection of either c-Fos or c-Jun with IL-2-CAT resulted in increased induction of CAT activity in stimulated T cells ( to 27-fold and 13-fold , respectively ; Fig .
4 ) .
Cotransfection of both c-Fos and c-Jun with IL-2-CAT resulted in a 44-fold induction of IL-2-CAT .
This represents a 10-fold enhancement over the control cotransfection ( Fig .
4 ) .
In addition , cotransfection of either c-Fos alone , or c-Fos and c-Jun together uncovered a threefold induction of IL-2-CAT by soluble anti-CD3e , which alone was insufficient to induce IL-2-CAT expression .
Cotransfection of c-Fos and c-Jun , either individually or together , did not cause induction of II-2-CAT activity in unstimulated T cells , confirming that other transcription factors such as NFAT-1 are also required for induction .
Cotransfection with c-Fos alone causes a reproducible three- to fivefold increase in the induction of IL-2-CAT activity in stimulated T cells , possibly because induction of c-Jun ( which is expressed in resting cells ) is not limiting for AP-1 activity ( 30 ) .
In contrast , cotransfection with c-Jun alone has a more variable effect , indicating that induction of c-Fos or other Fos family members may be limiting .
Cotransfection with c-Fos did not increase induction of the AP-1 site mutants M3 and M4 in response to crosslinked anti-CD3e ( 30 ) .
These results are consistent with the possibility that c-Fos and c-Jun act to enhance IL-2-CAT induction by binding to the -150 bp AP-1 site , and provide further in vivo evidence for the importance of the -150 AP-1 site for IL-2 promoter activation in untransformed T cells .
Conclusions .
- In summary , we have demonstrated that the IL-2 NF-KB site is not required for TCR-mediated induction of the IL-2 promoter in an untransformed T cell clone .
In contrast , the AP-1 site at -150 is clearly required for induction in vivo .
In the absence of any inducible binding with the -180 AP-1 site in gel-shift assays , our results establish that the -150 AP-1 site is a major , if not the only , kinase C-responsive site in the IL-2 promoter .
Cotransfection with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids enhances IL-2 promoter induction , most likely by acting at the AP-1 site at -150 bp .
However , it remains to be established which of the various Fos/Jun family members actually mediate activation of the IL-2 promoter in vivo .
