Tilton , '' and Larry Denner ' Advanced glycation end product ( AGE ) activation of the signal-transducing receptor for AGE ( RAGE ) has been linked to a proinflammatory phenotypic change within cells .
However , the precise intracellular signaling pathways involved have not been elucidated .
We demonstrate here that human serum albumin modified with N°- ( carboxymethyl ) lysine ( CML ) , a major AGE adduct that progressively accumulates with aging , diabetes , and renal failure , induced nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B-driven reporter gene expression in human monocytic THP-1 cells .
The response was blocked with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative ligand-binding domain of RAGE , with anti-RAGE antiserum , and by coexpression of truncated receptors lacking the intracellular domain .
Signal transduction from RAGE to NF- < B involved the generation of reactive oxygen spe-cles , since reporter gene expression was blocked with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine .
CML-modified albumin produced rapid transient activation of tyrosine phosphorylation , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 , and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , but not c-Jun NH , -terminal kinase .
RAGE-mediated NF- < B activation was suppressed by the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor S $ B203580 and by coexpression of a kinase-dead p38 dominant-negative mutant .
Activation of NF- « B by CML-modified albumin increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor-a , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ) severalfold , and inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked these increases .
These results indicate that p38 MAPK activation mediates RAGE-induced NF- « B-dependent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and suggest that accelerated inflammation may be a consequence of cellular activation induced by this receptor .

50 , JUNE 2001 lucose and other reducing sugars can react nonenzymatically with amino groups of pro teins and lipids to form Schiff bases that , through multiple rearrangements , are transformed into irreversibly cross-linked fluorescent advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) ( 1-3 ) .
The formation and accumulation of AGE adducts in various tissues are known to progress as a function of age and glycemia , are associated with altered protein structure and function , and are able to generate reactive oxygen intermediates and induce cellular activation and inflammation ( 1,4 ) .
Accumulation of AGEs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diverse disorders , including diabetes ( 1,5 ) , Alzheimer 's disease ( 6,7 ) , and hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis ( 8 ) , as well as the natural aging process ( 1,9 ) .
The finding that pharmacological inhibition of AGE formation prevents vascular complications affecting retina , kidney , and nerves in long-term diabetic animals provides support for this suggestion ( 1,10,11 ) .
One mechanism by which AGEs exert their effects on cellular function is via interaction with specific receptors .
Several AGE-binding proteins have been identified , including lactoferrin ( 12 ) , oligosaccharyl transferase complex protein 48 ( AGE-R1 ) ( 13,14 ) , 80OK-H protein ( AGE-R2 ) ( 13,14 ) , galectin-3 ( AGE-R3 ) ( 15 ) , lysozyme ( 16 ) , and the receptor for AGE ( RAGE ) ( 12,17 ) .
RAGE is a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed on the surface of a variety of cell types , including endothelial cells , smooth muscle cells , lymphocytes , monocytes , and neurons ( 18,19 ) .
Increased RAGE expression has been shown in both endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells from diabetic patients ( 5,20 ) and in macrophages from patients with renal failure and dialysis-related amyloidosis ( 21 ) .
Areas of enhanced RAGE immunoreactivity colocalize with immunostaining for AGE-reactive epitopes .
Recent studies also have demonstrated elevated RAGE expression in affected neurons in Alzheimer 's disease ( 7 ) and in vasculatures affected by autoimmune/inflammatory disorders ( 6 ) .
Interruption of AGE-RAGE interaction by administration of the soluble extracellular domain of RAGE has been shown to suppress diabetes-induced vascular hyperpermeability ( 22 ) and the accelerated development of atherosclerosis in diabetic apo-lipoprotein E knockout mice ( 23 ) .
Although these findings support a causal role for RAGE in the pathogenesis of 1495 RAGE-MEDIATED p38 MAPK-DEPENDENT NF-B ACTIVATION diabetes-induced vascular functional and structural changes , the intracellular mechanisms by which AGE-RAGE interaction causes vascular dysfunction remain unclear .
Interaction of AGE with RAGE has been shown to generate an oxidative stress that results in activation of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kB , the oxidant-sensitive transcription factor ( 24 ) .
NF-kB may contribute to the development of a proinflammatory state by stimulating expression of target genes , such as heme oxygenase ( 25 ) , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) ( 26 ) , procoagulant tissue factor ( 27 ) , endothelin-1 ( 28 ) , macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( 24 ) , and RAGE itself ( 29 ) .
Despite these observations , information regarding signal transduction from RAGE to NF- « kB-induced cytokine secretion remains largely unknown .
Several reports have linked reactive oxygen species ( 24 ) , p21 Ras , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 and 2 ( 30 ) to this signaling pathway , yet the potential role of other relevant signaling molecules remains unknown .
The purpose of the present study was to elucidate intracellular signaling pathways linked to RAGE activation in monocytes using the ligand N°- ( carboxymethylysine ( CML ) -modified human serum albumin ( HSA ) .
CML is a major adduct of AGE-modified proteins that accumulates in diabetic patients , has been recognized as a marker of oxidative stress ( 31,32 ) , and recently has been demonstrated to be a ligand for RAGE ( 33 ) .
We identified p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) as a key downstream effector of RAGE , since p38 is required for CML-HSA-induced NF-kB transcriptional activation and the subsequent increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -a , interleukin ( IL ) -16B , and monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 .
This report establishes a RAGE-p38 MAPK -NF-kB-cytokine signaling cascade in monocytes and raises the possibility that it may have physiological importance in the development of the proinflammatory milieu associated with such diverse diseases as Alzheimer 's , atherosclerosis , and diabetes .

Cells were grown at 37°C in a 5 % CO , atmosphere .
Log-phase cells were used for all experiments .
Human peripheral monocytes were isolated from healthy donors ' blood ( SeraCare , Oceanside , CA ) using standard Ficoll-Hypaque ( Amersham Phar-macia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) density-gradient centrifugation followed by adherence depletion of lymphocytes as previously described ( 85 ) .
Cells were seeded at 4 X 10° cells per well in a 48-well plate and treated with 100 pg/ml HSA or CML-HSA in the absence or presence of SB203580 or PD98059 for 24 h before measurement of TNF- « in the culture media by ELISA .
Anti-RAGE antiserum preparation .
The human RAGE extracellular domain encompassing residues 23-340 ( sRAGE ) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli using the pET thioredoxin system ( Novagen , Madison , WI ) .
For antiserum production , BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 ug sRAGE protein in complete Freund 's adjuvant , and an additional 50 ug sRAGE in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant was given every 4 weeks until a high serum titer was achieved .
NF-kB reporter neutralizing activity of the antiserum was measured by preincubation with THP-1 cells ( 1:5 or 1:25 dilution of the antiserum ) for 1 h before exposure to CML-HSA .
DEAE/dextran-mediated cell transfection and luciferase assay .
THP-1 cells were seeded at 5 X 10° cells per 100-mm dish in 10 ml of serum-free medium ( SFM ) the day before transfection .
Transfection was performed by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously ( 36 ) , with minor modifications .
Cells were washed once with SFM and resuspended in 1 ml of the same medium containing 2 pg NF- « B-Luc reporter plasmid ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) and 200 ug/ml DEAE-dextran ( Promega , Madison , WID ) .
The cell-DNA mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20-30 min before washing , centrifugation , and resuspension into fresh SFM .
Transfected cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 70,000 cells per well for recovery .
After 24 h , cells were treated with the indicated amount of control albumin or CML-modified albumin for 10 min to 24 h before cell harvest .
Equivalent amounts of cell lysates , normalized for total protein ( Bradford protein assay ; Bio-Rad , Palo Alto , CA ) , were used for measurement of luciferase activity .
Luciferase assays were performed using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Promega ) , and luminescence was detected in a TopCount microplate scintillation counter , using a single-photon monitor program ( Packard Instrument Company , Meriden , CT ) .
For cotransfection experiments , 10 ug ( 10-fold molar excess ) of expression plasmid was used with 1 g of the NF- « B reporter , with the empty vector serving as a transfection control .
Transfection efficiency in THP-1 cells was 20-30 % , as monitored by cotransfection with a -galactosidase expression plasmid ( Clontech ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Cell extracts were prepared using the protocol of Schreiber et al .
( 87 ) , with minor modifications .
Briefly , 2-4 x 10° cells were collected by centrifugation , washed in Tris-buffered saline , then resuspended by gentle pipetting in 400 pl cold buffer containing 10 mmol/l HEPES , pH 7.9 , 10 mmol KCI , 0.1 mmol/l EDTA , 0.1 mmol EGTA , 1 mmol/l .
dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , and 0.5 mmol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) .
The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min , after which Nonidet-P40 was added to a final concentration of 1 % .
The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation for 10 s ; the pellet was resuspended in 50 ul ice-cold buffer containing 20 mmol/ HEPES , pH 7.9 , 0.4 mol/l NaCl , 1 mmol/ EDTA , 1 mmol/ EGTA , 1 mmol/l DTT , and 1 mmol/l PMSF ; and the tube was rocked at 4°C for 30 min on a shaking platform then dialyzed against reaction buffer ( 20 mmol/l HEPES , pH 7.9 , 20 % glycerol , 50 mmol/l KC ] , 0.2 mmol/l EDTA , 1 mmol/l MgC ] , , and 1 mmol/l DTT ) .
The nuclear extract was spun for 5 min in the cold room .
Total protein content of the supernatant was determined , with the remainder stored at -70°C in aliquots .
Some 5 ug of the nuclear extract was mixed with 2 pg poly dl-dC and ~200 pg ( 10,000 cpm ) of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the c-myc NF-kB binding site ( CGTTGGGAAAACCCGGGATT ) in reaction buffer to a final volume of 30 ul and incubated at room temperature for 25 min .
Samples were run on a 5 % ( 30:1 ) polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA buffer .
Radiolabeled probes were prepared by labeling one of the oligonucleotides comprising the DNA binding site and then annealing it to its unlabeled partner .
Radiolabeling was performed using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ y-*P ] JATP .
After this reaction , unincorporated nucleotides and the T4 kinase buffer were removed , the unlabeled oligonucleotide was added , and it was heated to 80°C and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature .
RAGE-expression plasmids .
A cDNA-encoding RAGE was generated by reverse transcriptase ( RT ) -polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using human lung mRNA as a source for the cDNA and primers based on the published full-length sequence ( GenBank AFOQ1095 ) .
The product was fully sequenced and then subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA8.1 ( *Jneo .

CML-HSA induces NF-xB transcriptional activation in THP-1 cells .
A : Concentration-dependent stimulation of NF- « B-luciferase reporter by CML-HSA .
THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with the NF- « B-Luc reporter gene , treated 1 h with the indicated concentrations of CML-HSA , and harvested for analysis of luciferase activity .
B : Time-dependent stimulation of NF- « B-luciferase reporter by CML-HSA .
After transfection , cells were exposed to 100 ug/ml CML-HSA for the indicated period of time followed by luciferase measurement .
Relative luciferase activities are expressed as the mean + SE of at least three independent experiments with triplicate determinations , setting the basal ( i.e. , no CML-HSA exposure ) at 100 % .
C : CML-HSA treatment resulted in increased NF- « B DNA-binding activity .
Some 5 ug of nuclear extract prepared from THP-1 cells treated for 4 h with 100 pg/ml HSA , 100 ug/ml CML-HSA , or 10 ng/ml recombinant human TNF- « was incubated with radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the c-myc NF- « B binding site in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled probe ( competitor ) .
The single arrow indicates nonspecific binding to the probe , and the double arrows indicate specific DNA binding that is effectively competed by adding excess unlabeled double-stranded probe or is absent when the binding site was altered ( data not shown ) .
*P < 0.05 compared with basal levels .
RAGE lacking its intracellular domain was constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using primers to introduce a termination codon immediately after amino acid 364 ( RAGE-365t ) or amino acid 371 ( RAGE-372t ) .
RAGE-365t terminates two amino acids after the hydrophobic region thought to be the transmembrane domain , whereas RAGE-372t retains only a portion of the cytosolic tail that is not well conserved across species .
Western blotting analysis .
THP-1 monocytes ( 5 X 10° ) were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/l Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 150 mmol/l NaCl , 1 % Nonidet-P40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Cellular lysates ( 50 ug ) were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting .
Western blotting was performed using the indicated primary antibodies according to the instructions of each manufacturer .
Blots were then stained with the corresponding anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish-peroxidase conjugate ( 1:3,000 dilution ) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ( ECL , ; Amer-sham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Autoradiography was done at room temperature , and the appropriate exposures were quantitated by densitometry .
Measurement of cytokine secretion .
ELISA was used for quantitative measurement of released TNF- « , I-18 , and MCP-1 .
After treatment of the cells , the media was collected and analyzed by ELISA according to each protocol provided by the manufacturer ( R & D Systems ) .
Statistical analysis .
Quantitative data were expressed as means + SE , based on at least three separate experiments .
Unpaired Student 's £ test was used to determine the significance of differences among treatments .
A P value < 0.05 was considered significant .
RESULTS CML-HSA activates NF-KB transcriptional activity in monocytic THP-1 cells .
AGEs have been shown to stimulate NF-kB DNA-binding activity in vitro in a number of DIABETES , VOL .
50 , JUNE 2001 cell types ( 24,26,30,33 ) .
To determine whether CML-HSA induces NF- < B transcriptional activity , we used the THP-1 monocytic cell line transiently transfected with an NF-kB reporter gene .
Both RT-PCR and Western blot were used to demonstrate the presence of RAGE mRNA and protein , respectively , within THP-1 cells ( data not shown ) .
Transfected cells incubated with native HSA or without CMLHSA treatment were used as controls for basal luciferase activity .
Treatment with CML-HSA at > 100 pg/ml stimulated reporter gene expression by ~1.7-fold as compared with the basal level ( Fig .
14 ) .
CML-HSA exposure initiated a fast and statistically significant NF-kB response , with an initial induction observed as early as 20 min after treatment .
Luciferase activity was elevated approximately twofold within the first hour and remained essentially unchanged for 24 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
The lack of further luciferase accumulation after 1 h suggests an acute activation and deactivation of NF- « kB , whereas the prolonged signal probably reflects the stability of the luciferase protein .
The effect of 10 , 5 , and 1 % CML modification of HSA was tested using the NF-kB reporter assay , and a similar 1.5- to 1.7-fold increase in the luciferase signal was observed at modifications of > 5 % ( data not shown ) .

Requirement for RAGE in the CML-HSA-induced NF- « B response .
Blockade of CML-HSA-mediated NF-xB transcriptional activation by a synthetic peptide and neutralizing antiserum ( A ) or by coexpression of RAGE truncation mutants ( B ) .
A : 100 ug/ml CML-HSA was preincubated with or without a synthetic peptide derived from the extracellular ligand-binding domain of RAGE at 37°C for 1 h. The mixtures were then added to cell cultures and incubated for another 1 h before analysis of luciferase activity .
For the neutralizing antiserum experiments , RAGE antiserum ( at 1:5 and 1:25 dilution ) or the preimmune control serum ( 1:5 ) were preincubated with the transfected cells for 1 h before CML-HSA stimulation .
Results from native HSA treatment were set at 100 % .
B : Full-length ( wild-type ) RAGE or the cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants RAGE-372t or RAGE-365t were cotransfected with the NF- « B reporter into THP-1 cells .
After 24 h of incubation , cells were exposed to 100 ug/ml CML-HSA or HSA for 1 h before determinaton of luciferase activity .
Results shown were normalized to the HSA control .

Effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine , genistein , PD98059 , and S $ B203580 on NF- « B stimulation by CML-HSA .
THP-1 cells transfected with the NF- < B reporter were preincubated with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC , 500 pmol/l ) , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein ( 100 mol/l ) , an MEK-1 inhibitor ( PD98059 , 50 umol/l ) , or a p38 inhibitor ( SB203580 , 10 mol/l ) at 37°C for 30 min .
The cells were then exposed to 100 ug/ml CML-HSA for another 1 h and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity .
NF- « B reporter activity with HSA treatment was defined as 100 % .
All values represent the means + SE of at least three independent experiments ( *P < 0.05 ) .
CML-HSA-mediated NF- « B transcriptional activation , we prepared synthetic peptides based on sequences derived from the RAGE extracellular domain that have high probability of solvent accessibility .
A 17-amino acid peptide encompassing residues 102-118 of RAGE neutralized CML-HSA activity in a dose-dependent manner such that a 20-fold molar excess effectively eliminated the NF-kB response ( Fig .
24 ) .
Peptides corresponding to amino acids 39-56 and amino acids 67-82 ( both predicted to have a high probability of solvent accessibility ) had no detectable effect ( data not shown ) .
Mouse antiserum to sRAGE also blocked the CML-HSA-induced NF- « B response in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
24 ) .
To more clearly define the role of RAGE in CML-HSA signaling to NF-kB , we generated two RAGE cytoplasmic domain truncation mutants : RAGE-365t lacks the whole intracellular domain , whereas RAGE-372t retains a small nonconserved portion of the cytoplasmic tail .
Both mutants and wild-type RAGE were individually coexpressed with the NF-kB reporter .
In contrast to full-length ( wild-type ) RAGE , the mutants blocked the NF- < B response to CML-HSA ( Fig .
2B ) .
Similar results were seen when changes in NF- « B were measured by DNA binding activity ( Fig .
2C ) .
THP-1 cells were transfected with an empty vector ( peDNA3.1 ) , wild-type RAGE , or the RAGE-365t .
Both control and wild-type RAGE-transfected cells showed no increase in basal NF-kB DNA binding but exhibited a large increase after incubation with CML-HSA .
RAGE-365t decreased the response to CML-HSA .
Together , these results demonstrate that the intracellular domain of RAGE is required for CML-HSA-induced signaling to NF-kB and that expression of a RAGE in which this domain has been removed acts to block endogenous RAGE signaling in a DIABETES , VOL .
50 , JUNE 2001 trans-dominant manner .
RAGE specificity was demonstrated by the inability of the RAGE mutant , the peptide , or RAGE antiserum to block a fourfold increase in luciferase activity induced by TNF- « ( data not shown ) .
Involvement of reactive oxygen species , protein tyrosine kinase , and the MAPK family in CML-HSA-mediated NF- < B transcriptional activation .
We next examined the effect of selective inhibitors of potentially relevant signaling molecules impinging on the reporter response .
Cells transfected with the NF-kB reporter were pretreated for 30 min with each compound before stimulation with CML-HSA .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the antioxidant NAC ; the MEK1 ( an upstream kinase for ERK1/2 ) inhibitor , PD98059 ; and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 completely blocked CML-HSA-induced NF-kB activation .
Similarly , genistein , the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitor , resulted in a partial but significant reduction ( ~35 % ) in reporter activation .
Together , these results suggest a role for reactive oxygen species , PTK , and MAPK in the signaling from RAGE to NF- « B .
CML-HSA induces tyrosine phosphorylation .
Tyrosine phosphorylation is a crucial event that occurs rapidly and at a very early stage to propagate initial signals after activation of many receptors .
Since genistein diminished NF-kB activation by CML-HSA , we evaluated more directly the tyrosine phosphorylation profile after CML-HSA expo-sure .
Stimulation of THP-1 cells with CML-HSA caused rapid phosphorylation ( < 10 min ) on tyrosine residues of several proteins .
Prominent phosphotyrosine polypeptides migrated at 75 , 85 , and 125 kDa ( Fig .
4 ) .
Interestingly , the induced phosphotyrosine signals on these bands were abolished after 10 min and reappeared 60 min after treatment .
Activation of MAPK family members in response to CML-HSA treatment .
The results shown in Fig .
3 suggest that CML-HSA-mediated signaling to NF- < kB involves the MAPK family .

Tyrosine phosphorylation profile in response to CML-HSA ex-posure .
THP-1 cells were exposed to 100 g/ml CML-HSA for the indicated times , cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE , and tyrosine-phospho-rylated proteins were detected by blotting with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody .
Results shown are representative of three independent experiments .
1499 RAGE-MEDIATED p38 MAPK-DEPENDENT NF-B ACTIVATION we examined MAPK activation by Western blotting using antibodies specific to the active forms of the kinases .
As shown in Fig .
54 , stimulation of THP-1 monocytes with CML-HSA enhanced ERK1/2 MAPK activities approximately twofold over basal levels .
CML-HSA-mediated ERK activity peaked at 20 min and returned to basal levels by 45 min posttreatment .
Moreover , incubation of cells with PD98059 for 30 min before CML-HSA stimulation resulted in complete inhibition of ERK1/2 activation , whereas addition of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 had no detectable effect .
p38 Kinase , another member of the MAPK family , also responded to CML-HSA treatment , as its activity was stimulated 1.3- to 2 .
1-fold between 5 and 30 min , with maximal kinase activity at 20 min after CML-HSA exposure ( Fig .

Like ERKs , p38 activity returned to basal levels 45 min after treatment .
SB203580 , the selective inhibitor of p38 , blocked > 80 % of the p38 activation .
PD98059 had no detectable effect .
No changes were observed in the levels of JNK activation after CML-HSA stimulation ( Fig .

Concentrations of PD98059 and SB203580 that effectively blocked the NF-kB reporter response did not affect JNK activity .
CML-HSA-induced NF-KB transcriptional activation requires p38 MAPK .
To establish a direct role for p38 MAPK in RAGE signaling leading to NF-kB transcriptional activation , THP-1 cells were transfected with the NF-kB reporter and an expression plasmid directing the synthesis of a dominant-negative form of p38 .
Overexpression of the kinase-dead p38 mutant completely blocked CML-HSA-mediated NF- « B activation , as did expression of an IxB mutant resistant to phosphorylation-dependent degradation ( Fig .
64 ) .
To further verify that the expressed p38 mutant competes efficiently with the endogenous wild-type kinase , we also measured the p38 kinase activity from empty vector-transfected and p38 mutant-transfected cells .
In vitro kinase assays were performed using the transcription factor ATF-2 , a downstream target of p38 , as a substrate .
Although total p38 protein levels were elevated by expressing the mutant ( Fig .
6B , left panel ) , the p38 mutant-containing lysate had much less kinase activity compared with the empty vector-transfected control ( Fig .
6B , right panel ) .
CML-HSA-induced monocytic cytokine release requires p38 MAPK and NF-B .
Since it is well established that NF-kB mediates proinflammatory responses by regulating the expression of a number of cytokines ( 38,39 ) , and since CML-HSA induced p38-dependent NF-kB activation in THP-1 monocytes , we further investigated the role of p38 MAPK and NF-kB in CML-HSA-induced cytokine production .
Mock- , p38 , or IxB mutant-transfected THP-1 cells were exposed to CML-HSA for 24 h , and secreted cytokines were measured .
Table 1 shows that CML-HSA treatment induced a robust secretion of TNF- « and MCP-1 ( ~12- and 6-fold , respectively ) .
IL-1B production was less dramatic but still increased ~3.5-fold by 24 h. Expression of the p38 dominant-negative mutant or the IxB mutant significantly reduced the CML-HSA-induced secretion of these cytokines , indicating that p38 MAPK and are both required in the signaling pathway from RAGE to cytokine production .
To strengthen and extend this obser-vation , similar experiments were performed in peripheral blood-derived monocytes .

Requirement of p38 MAPK in CML-HSA-induced NF- « B transcriptional activation .
A : Cells were cotransfected with a kinase-dead p38 MAPK or an IxB dominant-negative mutant together with the reporter then treated for 1 h with 100 pg/ml CML-HSA or HSA , and results were normalized to the HSA treatment .
Data are the means + SE of at least three separate experiments ( *P < 0.05 compared with empty vector control ) .
B : Cell lysates from THP-1 cells that had been transfected with the p38 mutant or empty vector were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-p38 antibody for protein level ( left panel ) or an anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody for kinase activity after in vitro kinase reactions ( right panel ) .
DISCUSSION The results of our experiments identify a signaling cascade in THP-1 monocytes in which CML-HSA binds RAGE , leading to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 , causing increased DNA binding and transcriptional activation of NF- « B and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines .
Although many AGEs have been identified , including pen-tosidine , methylglyoxal , pyralline , and imidizalone ( 1,3,4,9 ) , to date , only CML has been reported to be an adduct on proteins that act as a ligand for RAGE ( 83 ) .
Our findings are consistent with previous observations that 1 ) RAGE plays a role in chronic cellular activation and tissue injury by serving as a cell-surface receptor for the S100/calgranulin family of polypeptides that are released from activated inflammatory cells and accumulate at sites of chronic inflammation ( 6 ) ; 2 ) AGE-induced increased endothelial cell tissue factor expression , a membrane-bound glycoprotein that initiates coagulation by its ability to bind factor VI/ TABLE 1 CML-HSA-induced monocytic cytokine release requires p38 MAPK and NF-kB Cytokine production ( pg/ml ) Transfection - Treatment TNF-a IL-18 MCP-1 Mock HSA 0.6 + 0.2 - 0.2 + 0.1 74A + 0.2 Mock CMLHSA 7.3 +03 0.7+0.0 - 44.3 + 0.5 p38 mutant CML-HSA - 2.5 + 0.1* 0.1 + 0.0 % 20.7 + 1.2* IxB mutant CML-HSA - 2.2 + 0.1* 0.1 + 0.0 % 25.8 + 0.4* Data are normalized by subtracting the background ( TNF- « , 1.7 + 0.2 pg/ml ; IL-1B , 0.2 + 0.1 pg/ml ; MCP-1 , 2.5 + 0.6 pg/ml ; mock , without treatment ) and represent the means + SE of three independent experiments .

50 , JUNE 2001 VIla , is blocked by RAGE antisense ( 27 ) ; 2 ) AGE-RAGE interaction induces cell-associated VCAM-1 expression ( 26 ) ; 4 ) high-molecular weight hyaluronic acid blocks AGE-induced NF- « B activation and proinflammatory cytokine production in J774 mouse macrophages ( 40 ) ; and 5 ) AGE adducts increase NF-kB DNA binding activity ( 24,30 ) .
Thus , although many studies have shown RAGE-induced NF-kB DNA binding activity , here we further show that this DNA binding leads to increased transcription of NF-kB target genes .
These findings , together with the observations that NF- « B is a pleiotropic regulator of many `` re-sponse-to-injury '' genes and that the expression of this cell-surface receptor is upregulated in a number of diverse pathologies , suggest a central role for RAGE in the expression of proinflammatory and prothrombotic genes .
Our results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE is required for CML adducts to activate NF- « B target gene transcription .
These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that transient transfection of a cDNA-encoding RAGE lacking the cytoplasmic domain imparted a dominant-negative effect when the ligand TABLE 2 CML-HSA-induced TNF- « release in peripheral monocytes is sensitive to 5B203580 and PD98059 Treatment TNF-a production ( pg/ml ) Sham 1.9 + 0.1 HSA 2.8 + 0.1 CML-HSA 11.0 + 0.9 CML-HSA + $ B203580 3.9 + 0.4* CML-HSA + PD98059 2.2 + 0.3 % Data are the means + SE of three independent experiments .
Peripheral monocytes were treated for 24 h as described , and culture media was collected for TNF- « measurement by ELISA .
*P < 0.05 compared with CML-HSA treatment .
1501 RAGE-MEDIATED p38 MAPK-DEPENDENT NF-B ACTIVATION was CML-ovalbumin ( 833 ) or S100B ( a member of the S100/ calgranulin family ) ( 6 ) .
A dominant-negative effect of the RAGE cytoplasmic tail also was reported on neurite outgrowth and NF- « B activation in N18 neuroblastoma and C6 glioma cells in response to AGE-modified bovine serum albumin and amphoterin ( 41 ) .
Although the conserved cytoplasmic domain of RAGE is required for CML-HSA to activate NF-kB , only some of the signaling intermediates in the path from RAGE to the nucleus have been demonstrated .
Thus , oxidant stress ( 24 ) , PTK ( 42 ) , p21Ras , and ERK1/2 MAPK ( 30 ) are involved in the AGE-mediated signaling cascade .
In addition , it has been suggested that more than one parallel pathway can be activated simultaneously by the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE ( 41 ) .
In that study , it was demonstrated that Rac and Cdc42 , the Rho family small GTPases , were responsible for RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth induced by amphoterin , but not the simultaneous activation of NF- « B-dependent transcription , which was dependent on Ras-MAPK pathway .
It is noteworthy that CML-HSA ligation of RAGE induced acute tyrosine phosphorylation followed by either dephos-phorylation or degradation .
For many transmembrane immunoglobulin-class receptors , signaling is initiated by ligand-induced aggregation that activates receptor-cou-pled tyrosine kinases ( 43,44 ) .
In most studies of mammalian receptors that signal by coupling to tyrosine kinase activation or that contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , the earliest obligate intracellular event after ligand engagement is tyrosine phosphorylation ( 45,46 ) .
Although our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in RAGE signaling , no consensus kinase motif has been identified in the RAGE intracellular domain .
Con-sequently , RAGE probably couples to a tyrosine kinase ( s ) , directly or indirectly , to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation .
Currently , intracellular proteins capable of binding to the RAGE cytoplasmic domain remain unknown .
A wide variety of extracellular signals regulate phosphorylation-dependent activation of MAPK family members that subsequently modulate transcriptional responses altering cellular function in normal and pathological set-tings .
Although there is considerable cross-talk within these signaling cascades , some generalities have emerged regarding the specific types of information that are processed through the three MAPK family members .
Thus , ERK typically mediates cell proliferation in response to growth factors , whereas p38 and JNK respond to cytokines and cellular stress inducers .
Previously , RAGE ligands have been reported to activate ERK in arterial smooth muscle cells ( 30,47 ) , rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells ( 30 ) , and renal tubulus cells in culture ( 48 ) , indicating that this pathway is common across a variety of cell types .
Our results implicate both ERK and p38 as key intermediates in CML-HSA activation of RAGE signaling leading to target gene expression in a human monocytic cell line .
The specificity of these responses is indicated by the lack of activation of JNK , the third MAPK family member .
Additional specificity is evident since p388 is not inhibited by SB203580 , suggesting that other p38 isoforms must mediate the response to CML-HSA ( 49 ) .
These observations on p38 appear not to be unique to the AGE ligand used , CML-HSA , since amphoterin-induced RAGE signaling in C6 glioma cells activated p38 as well as 1502 p44/p42 ( ERK ) and stress-activated protein kinase/JNK MAPKs ( 50 ) .
Indeed , the extent of induction for ERK1/2 and p38 was comparable in both studies .
Our inability to detect JNK activation in response to CML-HSA may be due to differences in cell types ( THP-1 monocytes versus C6 glioma ) , exposure times ( 10-60 vs. 90 min ) , and ligand used ( CML-HSA versus amphoterin ) , which may have different affinities for RAGE .
Other recent reports have shown closely related results ; CML-HSA increased NF-kB DNA binding through RAGE ( 33 ) , and glycated serum albumin stimulated ERK activity and NF- < B DNA binding ( 30 ) , but unfortunately , p38 was not evaluated in these studies .
Mechanisms that couple activation of MAPK to NF-kB target gene induction are complex .
It is particularly important to note that NF-kB DNA binding activity is necessary , but not sufficient , for transcription , as shown in several reports and reviews ( 51 ) .
For example , IxB degradation and NF- « B DNA binding were insufficient for TNF- and IL-1B-induced NF-kB-dependent transcription ( 52 ) .
In addition , inhibition of TNF-induced p38 activation blocked NF-kB-dependent gene expression without decreasing DNA binding activity ( 53 ) , leading to speculation that these intermediates converge at a more distal point .
A subsequent report further delineated a mechanism wherein p38 phosphorylated the TATA-binding protein TFIID , increasing its binding to the p65 subunit of NF-kB ( 54 ) , stabilizing the transcription complex and mediating gene expression .
This mechanism was further supported by observations that inhibitors of p38 and ERKs cooperatively regulated the transactivation potential of the p65 subunit ( 55 ) .
Thus , increased DNA binding activity shown here and by others is only an intermediate readout of RAGE signaling and illustrates the importance of analyzing target gene expression , as we report here , for secretion of the cytokines IL-1B , TNF- « @ , and MCP-1 .
Finally , our observations that both p38 and ERK mediate RAGE-dependent NF-kB target gene induction suggest that RAGE may be a pleiotropic integrator of AGEs that signal both growth factor-like proliferative responses as well as cytokine-like proinflammatory responses .
The present studies demonstrate that p38 activation is necessary for CML-HSA-mediated RAGE-dependent NF- « B activation , induction of target gene expression , and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from monocytes .
The identification of a RAGE signaling axis involving p38 extends our understanding of AGE-induced cellular dysfunction and provides a possible mechanism for p38 involvement in inflammation , arthritis , septic shock , and myocardial dysfunction after ischemia ( 56-59 ) .
Further-more , since AGEs-particularly CML adducts-are prevalent in diseases such as diabetes , renal failure , chronic inflammation , and Alzheimer 's disease ( 6,32,33,60 ) , our findings may provide another pathophysiologically relevant mechanism linked to these disorders .
Understanding the integrative aspects of RAGE in the diverse pathologies of AGEs provides a key challenge for future studies .
