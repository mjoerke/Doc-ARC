Abstract .
Unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) results in tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the affected kidney by stimulating the renin-angiotensin system .
This study established a UUO model in angiotensin type la receptor ( AT1la ) deficient ( mutant ) mice to elucidate the role of angiotensin II through AT1la on the fibrosis of the obstructed kidney ( OBK ) .
The relative volume of the tubulointerstitium was measured by an image analyzer ; deposition of collagen types III and IV and monocyte/macrophage infiltration were histologically examined using specific antibodies .
Also determined were the mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-B by Northern blot analysis .
Nuclear factor- « B activity was assessed by gel shift assay .
UUO in wild mice resulted in a marked expansion of relative volume of the tubulointerstitium , together with increased deposition of collagen types III and IV and number of infiltrated monocytes/macrophages in the interstitium , relative to sham-operated mice .
In comparison , these changes were significantly lower in mutant mice with UUO .
The mRNA level of transforming growth factor-B was significantly higher in the OBK of wild mice with UUO compared with sham-operated mice .
In contrast , the increase in mRNA level in the OBK of mutant mice was significantly less than in wild mice .
Finally , UUO resulted in activation of nuclear in wild mice but was inhibited in the OBK of mutant mice .
The results provide direct evidence that angiotensin II acting via the AT 1a plays a pivotal role in the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in UUO .
It is widely recognized that progressive renal disease is accompanied by tubulointerstitial changes characterized by tubular atrophy , increased number of interstitial fibroblasts , phenotypic change of interstitial cells , accumulation of matrix pro-teins , and interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear cells .
Deterioration of renal function is determined to a large extent by the degree of tubulointerstitial changes rather than by the extent of histologic changes in the glomeruli in many forms of glomerulonephritis .
However , the pathogenic mechanisms of tubulointerstitial changes have not yet been elucidated fully .
Evidence from many studies suggests that common pathogenic mechanisms exist in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial changes ( 1 ) .
Unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) is a well-established experimental model of progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis .

The renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) is also known to be activated in the setting of UUO .
UUO is associated with increased plasma renin activity and renal renin content , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) activity , and angiotensin II ( Ang II ) concentration in the experimental kidney ( 6 ) .
Ang II generated by RAS seems to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis .
Ang II also has been shown to mediate overexpression of transforming growth factor-B ( TGF-B ) gene ( 7 ) , a major cytokine in the regulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) protein synthesis ( 8 ) .
Furthermore , it has been shown that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin type 1 receptor ( AT1l ) antagonists ameliorate tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the rat UUO model ( 9,10 ) .
Ang II exerts a wide range of biologic activities through different types of receptors .
There are at least two major angiotensin receptors : ATI ( 11 ) and type 2 receptor ( AT2 ) ( 12 ) .
Molecular cloning of AT1 has been performed in several species .
These studies revealed the presence of two subtypes of AT1l : ATla and AT1b .
Sequence analysis of these subreceptors showed a high homology in the coding sequence of their mRNA ( 13 ) .
Although the functional difference between these subtypes has yet to be elucidated , AT 1a has been demonstrated to be the predominant isoform .
318 Journal of the American Society of Nephrology To elucidate the functional importance of AT la-mediated signal transduction pathways in the pathophysiology of renal diseases , especially tubulointerstitial injury , we established ATla-deficient ( mutant ) mice with a targeted replacement of ATla loci by the lacZ gene ( 14,15 ) .
Using these mice , we determined in the present study the role of the Ang II-AT1a system in the pathophysiology of tubulointerstitial injury after experimentally induced UUO .
Our results indicate that the action of Ang II via ATla plays an important role in the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis with UUO .
Materials and Methods Experimental Protocol Female C57BL/6 ( wild ) mice at the age of 10 wk , weighing 20 to 22 g , and female mutant mice at the age of 10 wk , weighing 25 to 35 g , were used in these experiments .
With the mice under pentobarbital anesthesia , the left ureter was ligated with 4-0 silk at two locations and cut between the ligatures to prevent retrograde urinary tract infection in both wild ( # = 14 ) and mutant mice ( n = 14 ) .
Mice that were operated on were killed under pentobarbital anesthesia 2 ( 7 = 5 ) , 5 ( n = 5 ) , and 10 ( n = 4 ) d after UUO .
Sham operation was performed in both wild ( @ r = 4 ) and mutant mice ( r = 4 ) ; mice had their ureters manipulated but not ligated .
Five d after sham operation , mice were killed to obtain control kidneys .
The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committees for Animal Experimentation of the participating institutions .
Morphometric Evaluation of Interstitial Fibrosis of Renal Cortex Obstructed kidneys ( OBK ) were removed , sliced axially into 3-mm-thick sections , fixed in 10 % buffered formalin , and embedded in paraffin .
Paraffin sections ( 4-pm thick ) were stained with Azan-Mallory stain .
Blue-stained interstitial fibrotic areas were assessed by using an image analyzer ( MCID image analyzer , Fuji Film , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Five consecutive fields were randomly selected in renal cortex and evaluated at X400 on a 10 X 10 grid-imprinted reticule .
All points not counted within tubular cells , lumen , glomerulus , or vascular space were considered interstitial .
This fraction represented the relative interstitial volume .
Results were expressed as percentage of the measured area , which represented the interstitial space and was determined as the relative volume ( Vv ) of the interstitium .
Immunohistochemical Studies Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously ( 16 ) .
Briefly , surgically removed kidney specimens were immediately snap-frozen and unfixed cryostat sections ( 4-um thick ) were prepared .
The sections were washed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) three times , 5 min each , and then incubated with the primary antibody in PBS for 1 h at room temperature .
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against type III collagen ( LSL Corp. , Tokyo , Japan ; dilution 1:60 ) and type IV collagen ( LSL Corp. ; dilution 1:30 ) were used as primary antibodies .
Each section was washed three times in PBS and incubated with the second antibody in PBS for 30 min .
Fluorescence isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG ( Zymed Laboratories , Inc. , San Francisco , CA ; dilution 1:80 ) was used as the second antibody .
After the section was washed with PBS three times , it was mounted with fluoromount-G. Deposition of type III and type IV collagens in the tubulointerstitium of renal cortex was assessed semiquantitatively by fluorescence microscopy as described previously ( 17 ) .
A matrix deposition score ranging from O to 3 was J Am Soc Nephrol 12 ; 317-325 , 2001 determined on the basis of the intensity and distribution of type III and type IV collagens in the tubulointerstitium : 0 , no change ; 1 , mild change ; 2 , moderate change ; 3 , severe change .
The matrix score was determined in each section selected at random and more than 40 fields were examined under X200 magnification .
Identification and Quantitation of Infiltrating Monocytes/Macrophages Infiltration of monocytes/macrophages was examined by immuno-histochemistry as described previously ( 18 ) .
Briefly , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized , and endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide .
Sections were then washed in PBS three times , 5 min each , preincubated in a blocking solution ( 10 % goat serum in PBS ) for 30 min , washed in PBS three times , and then incubated for 1 h with F4/80 ( Serotec , Oxford , England ; dilution 1:100 ) as the primary antibody against monocytes/macrophages .
Control sections using wild OBK sections were treated similarly but without addition of the primary antibody .
Each section was washed three times in PBS and then incubated with the second antibody for 30 min .
Biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG ( Nichirei Corp. , Tokyo , Japan ; dilution 1:1000 ) was used as the second antibody .
After the sections were washed with PBS three times , they were placed in streptavidin labeled with peroxidase ( Nichirei Corp. ) .
They were placed in diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide solution , counterstained with hematoxylin , dehydrated , and enclosed in synthetic resin .
Monocyte/macrophage infiltration was determined by counting the number of F4/80 positively stained cells in the renal cortex .
The number of F4/80-positive cells was determined in 20 randomly selected nonoverlapping X200 fields in each section of the individual mouse renal cortex .
The average number of F4/80-positive cells from three separate animals was calculated and averaged .
RNA Extraction and Northern Hybridization Analysis Total RNA from the cortex was extracted by the acid guanidium thiocyanate phenol chloroform extraction method , as described previously ( 19 ) .
RNA concentration and purity were determined spec-trophotometrically .
A total of 20 ug of RNA was run on 0.8 % agarose 6 % formaldehyde gels .
RNA integrity was verified by examination of 288 and 188 ribosomal bands of ethidium bromide-stained material under ultraviolet light .
The RNA was then transferred onto nylon membranes ( Hybond-N ; Amersham Life Science , Buckinghamshire , England ) by capillary action and fixed by ultraviolet irradiation .
Membranes were hybridized with a cDNA probe coding for mouse TGF-f labeled with [ « - '' °P ] dATP by random primed DNA synthesis .
Membranes were hybridized in a solution containing 1 % bovine serum albumin , 7 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 0.5 M NaHPO , and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate ( EDTA ) .
The filter was then exposed to x-ray film at -80°C for 1 to 7 d. The membrane was rehybridized with a cDNA probe coding for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydroge-nase ( GAPDH ) labeled with [ a- '' °P ] dATP .
The relative intensity of autoradiograms was determined by scanning densitometry .
Results were expressed as the ratio of optical density of TGP-B to GAPDH relative to baseline control kidneys that were arbitrarily assigned a value of 1 .
Detection of Renal ATla and ATIb mRNA Expression First , cDNA strand was synthesized from total RNA ( 1 ug ) by Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Little Chalfont , England ) with random hexamers as a primer .
ATla , AT1b , and GAPDH cDNA were amplified by J Am Soc Nephrol 12 ; 317-325 , 2001 AmpliTaq DNA polymerase ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) .
PCR was performed using 35 cycles for ATla and GAPDH , each cycle consisting of 30 s at 94°C , 45 s at 60°C , and 60 s at 72°C .
For AT1b , 35 cycles were used , each cycle consisting of 60 s at 94°C , 90 s at 55°C , and 90 s at 72°C .
PCR products were separated on 0.8 % agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts Nuclear extracts were prepared from the kidney cortex according to the procedure of Asanuma et al .
( 20 ) .
In brief , the kidney cortex was minced and suspended in 1 ml of TBS buffer ( 25 mM Tris-HCI ] [ pH 7.4 ] , 130 mM NaCl , and 5 mM KCI ) and homogenized for 20 strokes in a glass homogenizer .
The homogenates were centrifuged at 7000 X g for 30 s , and the pellets were resuspended with 1 ml of TBS buffer and vortexed for 10 s followed by centrifugation of the homogenates at 5000 X g for 30 s. The pellets were suspended in 1 ml of buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 10 mM KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM ethyleneglycol-bis ( B-aminoethyl ether ) -N , NV ' -tetraacetic acid , 1 mM phenyImethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 1 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] ) and chilled on ice for 20 min .
In the next step , 100 ul of 10 % Nonidet P-40 was added and vigorously vortexed for 15 s. The nuclear fraction was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 X g for 7 min and suspended in 100 pl of buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM ethyleneglycol-bis ( B-aminoethyl ether ) -N , N -tetraacetic acid , 1 mM DTT , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
The mixture was left on ice for 2 h with frequent agitation .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 X g for 7 min and stored at -80°C .
Protein concentration was determined by the protein assay reagent ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) .
Gel Shift Assay To detect the DNA binding activity , gel shift assay was performed as described previously ( 21 ) .
Consensus sequences of nuclear factor- « B ( NF-kB ) oligodeoxynucleotide ( ODN ) were as follows : 5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3 ' .
The ODN was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Binding reactions were performed with 15 pg of nuclear extracts in a binding buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl , , 4 % glycerol , and 50 mg/ml poly [ dl-dC ] .
Each 30- pl reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature , and then approximately 200,000 cpm of [ y°°P ] -ATP-labeled ODN probe was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature .
Samples were then electrophoresed on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) , 45 mM sodium acetate , 2.5 % glycerol , and 1 mM EDTA .
Electrophoresis was carried out for 2 h. After electrophoresis , the gel was dried and autoradiographed and the relative intensity of autoradiograms was determined by scanning densitometry .
To assess the specificity of the reaction , we performed competition assay with 50- and 10-fold excess of unlabeled consensus sequences of NF-KB .
The unlabeled probes were added to the binding reaction 10 min before the reaction of the labeled probe .
When supershift assays were carried out , polyclonal antibodies against p50 or p65 were added to the extracts 30 min before the labeled probe .
Each experiment was performed three times .
Statistical Analyses Data , shown as mean + SD , were analyzed by the unpaired £ test using the Macintosh StatView program ( Hulinks , Tokyo , Japan ) .
One-way ANOVA was used to determine the significance of the relative volume of the renal interstitium , F4/80 cell infiltration , type UUO in ATia-Deficient Mice 319 III collagen or type IV collagen matrix score , and results of Northern blots and gel shift assay .
P < 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference .
Results Expression of Renal ATla and AT1b mRNA The expression of ATla and AT1b mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) .
ATla mRNA was expressed in wild mice but was absent in mutant mice ( Figure 1 ) .
Renal AT1lb mRNA expression was not detected in either wild or mutant mice .
Morphology of the Renal Cortex Figure 2 demonstrated sections of the renal cortex stained with Azan-Mallory stain .
In sham-operated mutant mice , hypertrophy of juxtaglomerular apparatus and focal hypertrophy of intrarenal artery was evident compared with sham-operated wild mice ( Figure 2 , B and H ) , although the tubules and interstitium were normal ( Figure 2 , A and B ) .
Five d after UUO in wild mice , fibrous material and monocyte infiltration increased in the interstitial space .
Furthermore , thickening of the tubular basement membrane and widening of the interstitial space of the renal cortex were noted ( Figure 2 , C and E ) .
In contrast , the interstitial space in the mutant mice did not show a significant increase ( Figure 2D ) .
The prevalence of atrophic tubules as a result of UUO was prominent ( Figure 2F ) , and there were no changes in the glomeruli of either the OBK or the contralateral kidney at 5 d ( Figure 2 , G and H ) .
There was no particular change in renal function ( serum creatinine level : sham 0.22 + 0.05 to UUO after 5 d 0.25 + 0.06 mg/dl ) .

The interstitial volume of the OBK was significantly increased at 2 and 5 d of UUO in wild mice .
In the mutant mice , Vv of OBK at 2 ds was significantly less than in wild mice ( 11.2 + 1.5 % versus 16.8 + 2.2 % ; P < 0.01 ) .
At 5 d , the difference between the two groups was smaller but still significant ( 26.2 + 8.3 % versus 37.8 + 4.9 % ; P < 0.05 ; Figure 3 ) , but at 10 d after UUO , the interstitial volume of the OBK in mutant mice was increased the same as in wild mice ( 40.7 + 8.1 % versus 41.1 + 7.9 % ) .

Immunohistochemical Analysis Type III collagen was clear stained and confined to the renal interstitial space in control wild mice .
In OBK of wild mice at 5 d , interstitial type III collagen was markedly increased in the interstitial space compared with sham-operated kidneys ( SOK ; data not shown ) .
In contrast , type III collagen was not increased in mutant mice ; there was little staining of type III collagen in the interstitial space .
In sham-operated kidney , there was no difference between wild and mutant mice ( Figure 4 , A and B ) .
Increased deposition of type IV collagen at 5 d was observed in the OBK in wild mice .
In mutant mice , there was a significantly less deposition of type IV collagen in OBK at 5 d compared with that in wild mice ( Figure 4 , C and D ) .
The matrix scores for interstitial types III and IV collagen expression are summarized in Table 1 .
Two d after UUO , the matrix deposition score of type III collagen was significantly higher in wild mice than in SOK of wild mice .
However , no such increase was observed in mutant mice .
At 5 d after UUO , however , the difference between wild and mutant mice became smaller but was still significant ( P < 0.05 ) .
At 10 d after UUO , there was no significant difference between the two groups .
For matrix deposition score of type IV collagen , deposition was significantly higher 2 d after UUO in the wild mice compared with SOK ( Table 1 ; P < 0.01 ) .
In contrast , increased deposition measured at the same day in mutant mice was not significant relative to SOK of mutant mice .
Changes at days 5 and 10 in both groups were similar to those of type III collagen ( Table 1 ) .

Discussion Previous studies have shown that UUO in rats resulted in tubulointerstitial fibrosis ( 3,5,17,22 ) and that such pathologic changes could be reduced by ACE inhibitors or ATI receptor antagonists ( 10,17 ) .
Furthermore , reduced angiotensinogen expression attenuated renal interstitial fibrosis as a result of UUO in mice ( 23 ) .
These results suggest that in this model , RAS plays an important role in the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis .
The physiologic effects of Ang II within the kidney are mediated primarily by the AT 1 receptor subtype ( 24 ) .
The AT1 in rat and mouse has been further subclassified by molecular cloning into AT1a and AT1b subtypes ( 13,25,26 ) , which show 94 % homology at the amino acid level and are pharmacolog-ically indistinguishable from each other ( 13 ) .
A complete block of the AT la receptor is present in ATla-deficient mice from birth ; thus , this mouse is useful for investigating the specific function of AT la .
Using this model , we examined in this study the role of the Ang II-AT1la system in the development of interstitial fibrosis .
First , we demonstrated a lack of expression of AT 1b in this mouse by RT-PCR and thus confirmed that in this model , Ang II does not act through AT1b .

Angiotensinogen-deficient mice and ACE-deficient mice typically develop abnormal kidney with atrophy of renal papillae and renal vascular thickening ( 27,28 ) .
Unlike these mice , homozygous mutant mice used in our study did not show any histologic abnormalities in the tubulointerstitium of the renal cortex .
Our results showed that the volume fraction ( Vv ) of the cortical interstitium in the OBK in mutant mice was significantly less than in wild mice .
After 2 d of UUO , wild mice showed a 3.5-fold increase in interstitial volume , but mutant mice showed only a 1.2-fold increase .
However , after 5 d of UUO , the difference in Vv between two groups had become J Am Soc Nephrol 12 ; 317-325 , 2001 “ wink .

anisms inducing these changes .
In this regard , previous studies have demonstrated that both vitamin E ( 29 ) , an antioxidant , and arginine ( 30 ) , which increases nitric oxide ( NO ) produc-tion , improved renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis .
Reduced production of intrarenal NO and increased production of reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the tubulointerstitial fibrosis process , which is characteristic in the late phase in the UUO model .
Furthermore , because of the lack of Ang II-AT1a system in our mutant mice , certain compensatory mechanisms , such as endothelin-1 ( 1 ) , might explain the difference in the late and early phases in our model .
It has been demonstrated that angiotensin regulates at least 50 % of the renal interstitial fibrotic response in obstructive nephropathy using mice altering the number of copies of the angiotensinogen gene ( 23 ) .
Immunohistochemical studies showed less deposition of types III and IV collagen in mutant mice relative to wild mice .
Type IV collagen , a major component of the basement mem-brane , was observed in the thickened tubular basement membrane and widened interstitial space .
The amount of type IV collagen in the interstitium of mutant OBK after 2 d of UUO was similar to the sham-operated mice .
However , after 5 d , type IV collagen deposition increased in the interstitial space to a level similar to that in the wild mice .
TGF-B has a pleiotropic effect on matrix protein production .
TGF- stimulates gene expression of ECM components ( 31 ) .
Our results showed that the level of TGF-B mRNA was increased in the cortex of OBK of the wild mice compared with SOK .
This finding suggests that an increased level of TGF- in 324 Journal of the American Society of Nephrology the cortex augmented the synthesis of the ECM component .
In mutant mice , a UUO-induced increase in the level of TGF-B mRNA in the OBK was blunted relative to wild mice , suggesting that increased levels of Ang II stimulate gene expression of TGF- and result in accumulation of ECM .
Fern et al .
( 23 ) also showed that renal expression of TGF-B was not increased by UUO in mice that did not express the angiotensinogen gene .
ECM might accumulate not only by upregulation of its synthesis but also by downregulation of its degradation .
ECM proteins are degraded by various proteinases .
Among these , the plasmin activator-plasmin system plays a major role .
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 inhibits plasmin activation , which causes ECM storage .
In this regard , Ang II is known to stimulate the production of TGF-B and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 leading to a rapid matrix accumulation ( 32 ) .
Infiltration of monocytes/macrophages was observed in the renal cortex of the OBK during UUO .
Ishidoya et al .
( 10 ) reported that administration of ACE inhibitor but not Ang II receptor antagonist resulted in a significant reduction in the number of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages .
In contrast , Lafayette et al .
( 33 ) showed that ACE and ATI blockade resulted in similar beneficial effects on tissue injury after subtotal nephrectomy .
In another study , Wu et al .
( 34 ) demonstrated that treatment with both drugs reduced the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages in the interstitium .
In the present study , the number of monocytes/macrophages in the OBK of mutant mice was less than in wild mice .
Several chemoattrac-tants for monocyte/macrophage infiltration have been identi-fied , including macrophage-colony stimulant factor ( 18 ) , a lipid factor ( 35 ) , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) ( 36 ) , and osteopontin ( 37 ) .
MCP-1 gene transcription has been shown to be regulated by NF- « B ( 38 ) .
Recently , several reports have indicated the possible role of Ang II to induce NF-kB activation ; ACE inhibitor prevented NF- « B activation , MCP-1 expression , and macrophage infiltration in a rabbit model of early accelerated arteriosclerosis and in a rat model of immune complex nephritis ( 39,40 ) .
More recent , Morrissey and Klahr ( 41 ) showed that ACE inhibitor decreased activation in OBK .
We also showed that in the UUO model , NF- « B activity in the mutant mice was lower than in wild mice .
Together , these results indicate that NF- « B activation was mediated by the Ang II-AT1a system in renal cortex .
In summary , we demonstrated that the relative volume of the tubulointerstitium was significantly increased in the mouse renal cortex of the OBK at 2 or 5d after UUO compared with SOK .
This expansion was due to an increase in the deposition of type III collagen and type IV collagen and monocyte/ macrophage infiltration in the tubulointerstitium .
We also showed that the expression of TGF-B mRNA and NF-kB activation was increased in OBK .
In the mutant mouse , the increase in the interstitial volume , deposition of type III collagen and type IV collagen , the number of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in the tubulointerstitium , expression of TGF-B mRNA , and NF- « B activation were significantly reduced compared with the wild mice .
These results indicated that the Ang II-AT1a system plays an important role in the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in UUO in mice .
