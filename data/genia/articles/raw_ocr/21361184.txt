NEOPLASIA HTLV-1 p12 !
protein enhances STATS activation and decreases the interleukin-2 requirement for proliferation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells Christophe Nicot , James C. Mulloy , Maria G. Ferrari , Julie M. Johnson , Kaisong Fu , Risaku Fukumoto , Raffaella Trovato , Jake Fullen , Warren J. Leonard , and Genoveffa Franchini The p12 !
protein , encoded by the pX open reading frame | of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) , is a hydrophobic protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi .
Although p12 !
contains 4 minimal proline-rich , src homology 3-binding motifs ( PXXP ) , a characteristic commonly found in proteins involved in signaling pathways , it has not been known whether p12 ' has a role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways .
This study demonstrated that p12 !
binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) B chain that is involved in the recruitment of the Jak1 and Jak3 kinases .
As a result of this interaction , p12 !
increases signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 ( STATS ) DNA binding and transcriptional activity and this effect depends on the presence of both IL-2R B and y , chains and Jak3 .
Transduction of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-based retroviral vector expressing p12 !
also resulted in increased STATS phosphorylation and DNA binding .
However , p12 !
could increase proliferation of human PBMCs only after stimulation of T-cell receptors by treatment of cells with low concentrations of « CD3 and « CD28 antibodies .
In addition , the proliferative advantage of p12-transduced PBMCs was evident mainly at low concentrations of IL-2 .
Together , these data indicate that p12 !
may confer a proliferative advantage on HTLV-1-infected cells in the presence of suboptimal antigen stimulation and that this event may account for the clonal proliferation of infected T cells in vivo .

2001 ; 98:823-829 ) ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL ) , !
and its genome carries genetic information for the structural and enzymatic proteins , the regulatory proteins Tax and Rex , and other open reading frames ( orfs ) encoding small proteins with largely unknown functions . ''
HTLV-1 infects and immortalizes primary human T cells in vitro , and after several months , these cells acquire the ability to grow in the absence of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . '
The switch to IL-2 independence correlates in most cases with acquisition of a constitutive activation of the Jak/signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) pathway** and decreased expression of the src homology 2-contain-ing tyrosine phosphatase 1 protein , '' which regulates signaling from several hematopoietic surface receptors. ! ''
HTLV-1 also confers longevity on T cells in vivo , since expansion of T cells with identical integrations for HTLV-1 can be found at several-year intervals in the same infected individuals . ''
These findings raise the question of how CD4* T cells carrying the HTLV-1 provirus can expand and survive for a long time in vivo .
The HTLV-1 p12 '' protein , a hydrophobic protein resident in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi®® that is encoded by the 3 ' end orf I of the viral genome , '' forms dimers , '' has weak oncogenic properties , and binds to the p16 subunit of the vacuolar hydrogen adenosine diphosphatase ( H* ATPase ) .
Expression of p12 '' in infected cells is suggested by the presence of transcripts in cultured > '' '' and ex vivo cells from individuals infected with HTLV-1 . ''
The orf I is likely expressed in vivo because antibodies ( Abs ) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes to peptides from the orf I protein have been detected . ' '' '' ''
Importantly , ablation of the splice acceptor site for the singly spliced p12 !
messenger RNA from a molecular clone of HTLV-1 impaired viral infectivity in a rabbit model in This may be partly related to the finding that p12 '' interferes with major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC I ) heavy-chain trafficking and may facilitate escape of HTLV-1-infected cells from the host 's immune surveillance . ''
We previously reported that p12 !
also binds the IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) B and y , chains and affects their expression on the cell surface. ! ''
IL-2 is an essential cytokine for the growth and survival of T cells . '' ''
Binding of IL-2 to the IL-2R B and y , , chains results in activation and recruitment of Jak1 and Jak3 and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT5a and STAT5b .
STAT proteins have been found to be activated with a high frequency in a wide variety of human cancers , '' and STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT5 were shown to be activated in 70 % of ATLL primary cells . ''
In fact , there is good evidence that constitutively activated STAT signaling participates in oncogenesis by simultaneously promoting cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis . ''
Because p12 '' interacts with the IL-2R B and IL-2R y , , chains , we hypothesized that p12 !
may interfere with or augment signaling From the National Cancer Institute , Basic Research Laboratory , Bethesda , MD ; and the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , Laboratory of Molecular Immunology , Bethesda , MD .

824 _ NICOT etal pathways and contribute to proliferation of T cells infected with HTLV-1 .
In this study , we found that p12 '' , through its binding to the IL-2R B chain , increased STAT 5b transcriptional activation and simultaneously decreased the T-cell requirement for IL-2 for proliferation .
Materials and methods Expression plasmids The p12 '' complementary DNA tagged with the AU1 or HA1 epitopes , as well as the wild-type IL-2R B and IL-2R y , , chains and mutants for both chains , were cloned in the pME18S plasmid .
IL-2R B-chain mutants B33 , Bs5p , AH , AS , AA , and AST were described previously . ''
The remaining IL-2R B-chain mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the AST plasmid and resulted in deletion of amino acid residues 264 to 296 and 350 to 525 , 264 to 350 and 432 to 525 , and 264 to 390 , indicated by subscripts in the following : AST ; 2956.350 , AST 1350-432 , and AST 399-525 .
All plasmids were verified by sequencing .
The BCD4B and the « af chimeric receptors , which were described previously , '' contain the B chain in which the transmembrane region has been exchanged with the equivalent region of the CD4 receptor ( BCD4B ) or the extracellular and transmembrane region of the « chain has been joined to the B-chain cytoplasmic portion .
Lentiviral human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -based retroviral vector HR 'cyto-megalovirus ( CMV ) -Luc , CMV-driven HIV helper virus deleted for the erv and nef genes ( pDNL6 ) , and the HIV long terminal repeat-vesicular stomatitis virus G ( VSV-G ) envelope were described previously . ''
HA-tagged p12 !
was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Turbo PFU polymerase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , sequenced , and cloned between BamH1 and Xhol restriction sites ( HR'CMV p12 '' HA ) .
DNA transfections , immunoprecipitations , Western blotting , and immunofluorescence One million COS-7 or 1.2 X 106 293T cells were plated in a 100-mm dish and transfected the next day with 10 jpg of each plasmid by using the calcium phosphate method . '' ''
Cells were then collected , washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , lysed in lysis buffer by freeze-thawing , and assayed for luciferase activity ( Promega ) .
Abs against the AU1 ( Berkeley Antibody , Richmond , CA ) and HA1l ( 12CA5 ; Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) epitopes were used to immunoprecipitate the wild-type p12 '' mutants .
Monoclonal Ab anti-B chain ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) was used to immunoprecipitate the IL-2R B chain in association with protein glycine agarose ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Polyclonal rabbit serum was used to detect B-chain protein with antirabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated as secondary Ab .
Immu-noprecipitations were done in radicimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer overnight at 4°C by using 2 jug/mL Ab .
Protein glycine agarose was then added .
After an additional 2 hours at 4°C , immunocomplexes were washed in RIPA buffer containing Tween 20 0.1 % , resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) gels ( Novex , San Diego , CA ) , and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Hybond ; Amersham , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Detection was done with a chemilu-minescent system ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Labeled proteins were analyzed in 15 % SDS-PAGE gel and visualized on X-Omat film ( Kodak , Rochester , NY ) .
Western blotting for STATS was done by using Ab Y694 and Y699 ( Upstate , Lake Placid , NY ) .
Pseudotype virus production and concentration The 293T cells ( 2 X 10° ) were seeded on a 10-cm dish and transfected the following day with VSV-G ( 2 g ) , pDNL6 ( 4 pug ) , and HR'CMV-Luc or HR'CMV p12 !
( 4 ug ) by using an Effectene reagent kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Supernatant from 20 dishes was collected every 12 hours from 24 hours to 72 hours after transfection , cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 8000g for 10 minutes at room temperature , filtered through a 0.45 jum filter , and stored at BLOOD , 1 AUGUST 2001 « VOLUME 98 , NUMBER 3 -80°C .
Pseudotype viruses were formed into pellets by ultracentrifugation at 50 000g ( 28 000 rpm with a SW41 rotor ) for 1.75 hours at 4°C .
Virus was then resuspended in PBS by means of a 4-hour incubation on ice , collected , divided into aliquots , and stored at -80°C .
HIV gag p24 was measured by using an antigen capture assay ( Coulter , Miami , FL ) .
Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were infected by using comparable amounts of viral particles for both HR'CMV-Luc and HR'CMV p12 .
Infectivity and expression were verified by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation Western blot assays .
Primary T-cell infection and proliferation assay Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque methods ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) , washed in PBS , and either used as such or after suboptimal stimulation obtained by phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ; 1 ng/mL ) or CD3/CD28 ( 0.5 ng/mL ) for 24 hours before infection with HR'CMV p12 '' or HR'CMV-Luec VSV pseudotyped viruses .
Infected cells were plated in duplicate in a 96-well plate ( 3 X 10+ cells/well ) in 100 L RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 % fetal-calf serum ( FCS ) in the absence or presence of 2.5 , 5 , or 10 U/mL IL-2 ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Cellular proliferation assays were done on days 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 after infection by using a Colorimetric Cell Proliferation Kit II ( Roche Molecular , Indianapolis , IN ) as described by the manufacturer .
Spectrophotometric absorbance was measured with a mean filter at 492 nm and a reference filter at 690 nm .
SDs were calculated from values obtained from 2 independent infections of each donor cell , and results were representative of 3 independent experiments done using cells from 3 human volunteers .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays PBMCs from healthy volunteers were purified with the Ficoll-Hypaque method , washed in PBS , activated with 5 g/mL PHA for 3 days , washed again in PBS , and cultured for 5 days in RPMI 10 % FCS and 10 U/mL IL-2 .
Lymphocytes were infected with HR'CMV p12 '' or HR'CMV-Luc pseudotype viruses .
After 18 hours , PBMCs were washed twice in medium free of serum and IL-2 and deprived overnight of serum ( 0.1 % ) and stimulation with IL-2 .
The next day , infected PBMCs were divided into 6 batches of 2 X 10° cells and pulsed with 0.1 , 1 , 10 , 100 , or 1000 U/mL IL-2 for 10 minutes at 37°C .
Unstimulated cells were used as controls for basal levels of STATS activation .
Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed and lysed in 20 pL lysis buffer . ''
Binding reactions were done with 2 ug protein extract , as previously reported , '' with an increase in incubation time from 30 minutes to 1 hour .
STATS DNA binding activity was measured by using phosphorus 32 ( @ P ) -labeled B-casein y-interferon activated sequence ( GAS ) elements .
The DNA-protein complexes were separated on prerun 5 % native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 X Tris borate EDTA buffer at 200 V for 2 hours .
Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at -80°C .
Gel-shift analysis using the B-casein GAS element was done as described previously . ''
COS-7 cells were transfected and pulsed with the selected amounts of IL-2 , nuclear extracts were made , and 10 jug of nuclear extracts were incubated with 20 000 cpm 3°P-labeled B-casein GAS element and run on 5 % native polyacrylamide gels .

BLOOD , 1 AUGUST 2001 « VOLUME 98 , NUMBER 3 immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with Ab to the receptor ( R & D Systems ; goat antiserum against human IL-2R B [ RDB ] ) and to p12 !
( « eHA1 ) ( Figure 1 ) .
The BAST mutant lacking most of the cytoplasmic tail ( A267 ) failed to bind p12 '' ( Figure 1 , bottom panel , lane 5 ) .
Although the B33 , mutant also failed to bind p12 , the Bsp mutant ( lane 7 ) did bind , indicating that the region encompassing amino acids 330 to 350 of the receptor was required for p12 '' binding ( Figure 1 , bottom panel , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
The BAA mutant , which lacks amino acids 313 to 382 , also did not bind p12 , whereas the BAS mutant ( A267-322 ) did ( Figure 1 , bottom panels , lanes 13 and 14 ) , further supporting this idea .
Because the BAH mutant coprecipitated more p12 !
when increased than the B35 , mutant ( Figure 1 , bottom panel , lanes 7 and 8 ) , we investigated whether the binding site of p12 '' on the IL-2R B chain extended beyond amino acid 350 , which is present in the BAH mutant ( Figure 1 , top panel ) .
To do this , 3 additional deletion mutants were constructed and coexpressed with p12 '' ( Figure 1 , top panel ) .
Coprecipitation of p12 '' was observed with the BAST 1395-350 mutant , whereas neither BAST 1359433 nor BAST ; 399.5325 coprecipitated p12 '' ( Figure 1 , bottom panel , lanes 18-20 ) .
Therefore , the primary binding site of p12 !
to the IL-2R B chain appears to be proximal to amino acid 350 , although there could be additional contacts beyond this region .
Importantly , this region was previously shown to be critical for the recruitment of Jak1 and Jak3 after IL-2 signaling . ''
p12 !
increases STAT5b DNA binding activity Because p12 '' binds the IL-2R B chain in a region involved in transduction of the IL-2 signal , we hypothesized that p12 '' could modulate activation of the nuclear effector of IL-2 signaling , STATS .
To investigate this hypothesis , the IL-2R signaling path A 91214111 l : Figure 1 .

In this experimental system , the phosphorylation and DNA binding of STATS5 can be assessed before and after IL-2 triggering of cells .
COS-7 cells were pulsed with IL-2 for 20 minutes , and nuclear lysates were evaluated for the presence of activated STAT 5b by measuring STATS5 binding to the B-casein probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) as described previously . '' ''
A 2- to 4-fold increase in the basal level of STATS binding to the B-casein probe was observed in the presence of p12 !
( Figure 2A , top panel , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Results with controls for equivalent expression of IL-2R ( and p12 '' and the association of p12 '' with the IL-2R B chain are also shown in Figure 2A .
Together , these findings suggest that p12 '' increases STATS DNA binding in the absence of IL-2 and that less IL-2 is required to promote STAT 5b binding activity in the presence of p12 .
p12 !
does not influence degradation of activated STATSb IL-2-induced STATS activation is tightly regulated by dephosphorylation and protein degradation . ''
To investigate whether the increase in p12 -induced STATS activation resulted from a delay in its degradation , we studied the decay of STATS binding activity after IL-2 pulsing and removal of the ligand .
Higher levels of STAT5 binding activity were detected in the presence of p12 '' at all time points after the IL-2 washout ( Figure 2B ) .
However , the rate of decay of the STATS binding activity did not appear to be affected by p12 , since the amount of STAT 5b binding to the B-casein probe was reduced by about 50 % at 80 minutes ( Figure 2C ) .
Thus , p12 '' does not appear to increase IL-2R signaling by delaying STATS inactivation or degradation .

binding to the IL-2R B chain is necessary to increase STATS5b transcriptional activity To assess whether the increased STAT 5b DNA binding induced by p12 '' also resulted in increased transcriptional activity of STAT 5b , the IL-2R signaling pathway was reconstituted in 293T cells and a B-casein promoter luciferase reporter gene was used to measure STAT5b transcriptional activation in the presence of p12 '' .
We found that p12 '' increased STAT5b transcriptional activity by approximately 2-fold to 3-fold ( Figure 3A ) ; this increase was also evident in the presence of increasing amounts of IL-2 ( Figure 3B ) .

In this experiment , 2931 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing IL-2 B , IL-2R y , , Jak3 , and STATSb with or without p12 ' .

The increase in STAT 5b transcriptional activity induced by p12 '' required the presence of all components of the IL-2R pathway , since the absence of B , y , , or Jak3 resulted in loss of STATS activation despite the presence of p12 '' ( Figure 3C ) .
In addition , p12 '' binding to the B chain at amino acids 330 to 350 was also essential for p12 '' induction of STAT5b activity because in the presence of the BAA mutant , which maintains its ability to transduce the IL-2 signal '' ( although at a lower level ) but lacks the 330- to 350-amino acid stretch that binds p12 ' , no increase in STAT5b activity was observed ( Figure 3D ) .
Increased transcriptional activation was also observed when STAT 5a was used instead of STAT 5b ( data not shown ) .
Together , these results show that p12 !
decreases the threshold of IL-2 signaling and that this effect depends on binding to the IL-2R B chain .
Because the B and y , chains are also part of the IL-15R , it would be interesting to determine whether p12 !
could also affect IL-1 5R signaling . ''
p12 !
increases STATS phosphorylation and DNA binding in primary human PBMCs HTLV-1 infects and transforms human primary PBMCs both in vivo and in vitro .
Therefore , we investigated whether p12 '' would increase STATS activation in its natural target-cell population .
An HIV-1-based retroviral vector expressing p12 '' was constructed ( HR'CMV p12 '' ) .
Expression of -tagged p12 '' was assessed first in transfected 293T cells by Western blotting , and the characteristic doublet of p12 !
was readily detected ( Figure 4A ) .
Transduction of HR'CMV p12 !
in primary human PBMCs was properly localized in the ER-Golgi compartment , as demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence ( Figure 4B ) .
To assess the effect of p12 !
on PBMCs , peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy volunteers were infected with pseudotype viruses carrying p12 '' or the luciferase genes .
After 18 hours , PBMCs were deprived of serum and IL-2 to lower the STATS basal level of DNA binding activity .
Cells were then pulsed for 10 minutes with various concentrations of IL-2 , and STATS phosphorylation and activation was assessed by either gel-shift assay or Western blot using Ab to phosphorylated STAT5 .
The expected DNA-protein complex in nuclear extracts of cells pulsed with IL-2 was readily observed by using the B-casein probe ( Figure 4C ) , and From www .

Cells were pulsed with various amounts of IL-2 ( 0 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 100 IU/mL ) as indicated .
( D ) Western blot analysis using a phospho-STATS-specific Ab was done on the same cellular extracts used in the gel-shift assay .
the identity of STATS in the DNA complex was demonstrated by using a specific STATS Ab to supershift the complex ( Figure 4C ) .
At 10 U and 100 U IL-2 , the level of STAT5-DNA complex was a few-fold higher in cells infected with HR'CMV p12 '' than in cells infected with the control HR'CMV-Luc virus , suggesting that p12 '' may enhance STAT5 phosphorylation and DNA binding .
To confirm this finding , the same nuclear lysates were used in Western blot analysis using a mouse monoclonal Ab to the phosphorylated STATS .
This experiment confirmed the presence of a higher level of phosphorylated STAT 5 in cells infected with HR'CMV p12 '' than in those infected with HR'CMV-Luc after pulsing with IL-2 ( Figure 4D ) .
Thus , as observed in COS-7 cells , p12 !
increased STATS activation in primary human PBMCs .

ACTIVATES STATS - 827 p12 !
decreases the IL-2 requirement for T-cell proliferation An expected consequence of an increased basal level of STAT5 activation is that cell proliferation may occur with a lower concentration of exogenous IL-2 .
To investigate this hypothesis , PBMCs from healthy volunteers were isolated , washed in PBS , and either used as such or after suboptimal stimulation with either PHA ( 1 ng/mL ) or CD3/CD28 ( 0.5 ng/mL ) for 24 hours before infection with HR'CMV p12 '' or HR'CMV-Luc pseudotype viruses .
Infected cells were then divided into 4 aliquots and plated in duplicate in 96-well plates in the absence or presence of 2.5 , 5 , and 10 or 100 U IL-2 .
Cellular proliferation was monitored as described . '' ''
The p12 '' -transduced PBMCs stimulated in suboptimal conditions proliferated faster than the Luc-transduced PBMC control ( Figure 5 ) and , although this effect was evident with 2.5 U and 5 U IL-2 ( Figure 5D-E ) , it was lost at higher concentrations ' '' of the ligand ( Figure 5E ) .
Furthermore , this effect was evident only within the first few days after infection , it became undetectable 4 days after infection ( Figure 5F ) , and it was not observed at all in unstimulated resting PBMCs ( Figure 5A-C ) .
Other studies suggested that p12 '' may affect HTLV-1 infectivity by promoting activation of quiescent primary T lymphocytes . `` !
Our results , obtained from experiments with samples from 3 different donors , do not seem to support this conclusion , since p12 !
did not stimulate T cells to proliferate in the absence of an exogenous activating signal .
Together , these data suggest that p12 !
expression alone is not sufficient to activate T cells but that it enables T cells , activated in suboptimal conditions , to proliferate even in the presence of a low level of IL-2 .
Discussion HTLV-1 has persisted in nonhuman and human primates for thousands of years , as shown by the finding of proviral DNA in Andean mummies . ''
HTLV-1 virions , in contrast to HIV-1 virions , are poorly infectious in vitro , and HTLV-1 is thought to be transmitted efficiently mainly through cell-to-cell contact . !
Therefore , maintenance of a large pool of long-lasting infected T cells carrying the provirus in infected individuals '' has likely been instrumental in preventing extinction of HTLV-1 .
However , the expansion of infected T cells does not occur without risk .
In fact , in 1 % to 2 % of individuals infected with HTLV-1 , ATLL , a fatal clonal disease , develops , presumably by means of accidental accumulation of somatic mutations of genes that regulate T-cell growth .
The ways in which HTLV-1 immortalizes T cells in vitro likely mirror the mechanisms used by the virus in vivo .
In vitro , the viral transactivator Tax overrides normal mechanisms for controlling cell growth by affecting the activity of regulators of cell-cycle progression , such as p53 , '' '' 3° the Rb protein , '' and MAD1 , *° and by either suppressing expression of the cell-cycle regulators c-Myb '' and B-Myb '' or increasing expression of antiapoptotic proteins , including Bcel-X # > and Bel-2 .
In addition , Tax appears to have a costimulatory effect on T cells by inducing dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 , '' resulting in activation of CD28-responsive elements in the IL-2 promoter '' and the IL-2R a chain , '' which together with the B and y. chains , forms the high-affinity receptor for IL-2 .
However , although Tax is important in preventing T-cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest , its immunogenicity in vivo '' '' may interfere with the ability of infected cells to survive immune recognition .
The HTLV-1 p12 '' protein may play a crucial role in this regard .
First , the ability of p12 '' to target the MHC I for From www .

degradation '' * may markedly decrease the density of the MHC I/viral-peptide complexes ( including Tax peptides ) on the cell surface and render the infected cells invisible to recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes .
Second , as demonstrated in this study , the ability of p12 '' to increase the basal level of STATS activation and T-cell responsiveness to IL-2 , coupled with the costimulatory effect of Tax , may ultimately result in a limited burst of virus as well as limited replication of HTLV-l-infected T cells .
Both the Tax costimulatory effect and the increased STATS activation induced by p12 !
appear to depend on antigen or mitogen stimulation , suggesting that cell-cycle entry of HTLV-1-infected T cells may be promoted in the presence of antigen stimulation in the microenvi-ronment .
In support of this hypothesis , epidemiologic studies have indicated that patients with concomitant Strongyloides stercoralis infection have a higher frequency of ATLL.4** ' Interestingly , HTLV-1 and HIV-1 have independently evolved 2 proteins ( p12 ' and Nef ) with similar cellular targets .
Both p12 '' and Nef target subunits ( although different ) of the vacuolar H+ATPase'* '' '' ; p12 !
interferes with trafficking of MHC I heavy chain to the cell surface , '' '' whereas Nef down-regulates the MHC I that has already reached the cell surface , and both proteins increase IL-2 responsiveness ( though by different mechanisms ) .
`` `` > '' '' In addition , ablation of Nef and p12 '' from molecular clones of simian immunodeficiency virus and HTLV-1 , respectively , results in a similar phenotype , ie , their absence impairs viral infectivity in vivo , but their presence is not essential for viral infectivity or replication in tissue culture . '' '' '' ''
Thus , the 3 ' region of both human retroviruses encodes proteins ( p12 !
and Nef ) that help to preserve life-long infection of humans while increasing the likelihood of viral transmission .
