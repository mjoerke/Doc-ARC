CHEMOKINES NF-B Activation Is Required for C5a-Induced Interleukin-8 Gene Expression in Mononuclear Cells By Matthew H. Hsu , Meiying Wang , Darren D. Browning , Naofum i Mukaida , and Richard D. Ye C5a , a potent peptide chemoattractant , stimulates interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
Experiments were conducted to understand the mechanisms for C5a-induced IL-8 production , w hich was 14-fold greater than that in unstimulated cells by 2 hours .
IL-8 secretion was accompanied by accumulation of IL-8 mRNA in the cytosol and by nuclear expression of a « B DNA binding activity within 30 minutes .
AP-1 but not NF-IL-6 DNA binding activity was also detected in C5a-stimulated PBMC ; however , its delayed expression ( maximal at 4 hours ) suggested a less important role in the rapid production of IL-8 .
The correlation between C5a-induced B binding activity and IL-8 gene expression was examined in the RAW264.7 macrophage cells using reporter genes directed by the kB 5a IS A PROINFLAMMATORY peptide generated through activation of the complement system , which occurs in the course of trauma , immune complex formation , and bacterial infection . `` ?
C5a is more potent than the other two activated complement anaphylatoxins , C3a and C4a , in activating peripheral blood leukocytes . ''
The proinflammatory effects of CSa are mediated through binding of this peptide agonist to specific receptors expressed on the surface of peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes* ( reviewed in Gerard and Gerard '' ) .
More recent studies indicate that the same receptor is also present in hepatocytes , astrocytes , and glial cells .
* '' Molecular cloning and characterization of CS5a receptors have led to the determination of its primary structure as a G-protein-coupled receptor with 7 putative transmembrane domains .
'* '' CSa receptor , together with the receptors for fMet-Leu-Phe , platelet-activating factor , leukotriene B , , and a growing number of chemokines , form a subgroup within the large family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors . !
* Binding of CSa to its receptor in phagocytes induces chemotaxis , generation of superoxide anions , and release of degradative enzymes . ''
CSa receptor appears to have a nonredundant function in innate immunity , because targeted deletion resulted in weakened mocosal host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lung . ''
Several studies demonstrate that C5a actively regulates local cytokine networks by stimulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines .
It has been reported that recombinant CSa stimulates transcription of the interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) genes . ' ''
CS5a can also enhance the effect of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in its stimulation of IL-6 synthe-sis '' and acts synergestically with y-interferon to stimulate IL-1 synthesis .
' 8 In addition , C5Sa has been shown to induce P-selectin expression in endothelial cells . ''
The role of CSa in regulating gene expression was further suggested by recent studies of CSa receptor knockout mice , which demonstrate reduced TNFa and IL-6 levels in peritoneal reverse passive Arthus reaction compared with the wild-type littermates . ''
Although these activities are consistent with the proinflammatory functions of CSa , the mechanism for CSa stimulated cytokine generation remains incompletely understood .
There Blood , Vol 93 , No 10 ( May 15 ) , 1999 : pp 3241-3249 sequence from IkBa and IL-8 promoter regions .
C5a-induced reporter gene expression was abolished by introducing mutations into the B sites and by coexpression of a dominant negative IkBe « construct resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation .
Pertussis toxin , which ADP-ribosylates the G ; proteins known to couple to the C5a receptor , produced minimal inhibition of C5a-induced IL-8 expression and had little effect on C5a-induced calcium mobilization in RAW264.7 cells .
These results suggest that NF-B activation is required for C5a-induced IL-8 gene expression and that this response is mediated primarily through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathw ay .

have been conflicting reports regarding whether CS5a is able to stimulate transcription and translation of cytokine gene* '' '' or its effect is confined only to transcriptional activation . !
To better understand the role of C5a in regulating transcription and translation during inflammation , we investigated the ability of C5a to stimulate IL-8 synthesis at both protein and nucleic acid levels .
IL-8 is a CXC chemotactic cytokine that has been extensively characterized both structurally and function-ally .
IL-8 plays an important role in acute inflammation through binding to and activation of the IL-8 receptors on neutrophils and mononuclear cells. > > IL-8 is also angiogenic* '' and may stimulate its own biosynthesis through an autocrine mechanism ( unpublished results ) .
The genomic structure of IL-8 and the transcriptional elements regulating its expression have been characterized previously , '' '' permitting a detailed study of the effect of C5a on IL-8 gene expression .
Using a combination of immunologic and recombinant DNA approaches , we investigated IL-8 gene expression and protein synthesis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in a macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 .
Our results indicate that C5a induces activation of NF-KB , which is necessary for a rapid increase in IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in the stimulated cells .

3242 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .
Human CSa was obtained from two sources : natural CS5a purified from human serum ( kindly provided by Dr T.E .
Hugli , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) and recombinant human CSa ( purchased from Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis , MO ) .
The recombinant CSa was tested negative for the presence of LPS with a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay that detects LPS at a concentration of 25 pg/mL .
Human IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit was purchased from Biosource ( Camarillo , CA ) .
Pertussis toxin was obtained from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) .
Actinomycin D , cyclohex-amide , and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate were purchased from Sigma .
Oligonucleotides with the consensus sequences of NF-xB , AP-1 , and NF-IL-6 binding sites were obtained from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .
Rabbit antibodies against p50 and p65 , and their neutralizing peptides , were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
Human PBMC were prepared from fresh , heparinized venous blood by Ficoll-Hypaque ( Sigma ) density gradient centrifugation .
Platelets were separated from PBMC by washing with Hank 's balanced salt solution ( GIBCO-BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) and by centrifugation through a fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) cushion gradient that allows penetration of mononuclear cells but not platelets .
The PBMC pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium ( Irvine Scientific , Santa Ana , CA ) and cultured in round-bottom culture tubes for induction of IL-8 synthesis at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO ; .
All of the solutions used in these studies were either subjected to ultrafiltration for elimination of microbial products or treated with an endotoxin removal kit ( Associates of Cape Cord , Inc , Woods Hole , MA ) .
Determination of immunoreactive IL-8 by ELISA .
- Approximately 0.5 X 10° PBMC were cultured in 1 mL RPMI 1640 medium and stimulated with CS5a for various time periods .
The supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-8 secretion by ELISA according to instructions from the manufacturer ( Biosource ) .
RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis .
- PBMC ( 0.5 X 10° ) were preincubated with or without various inhibitors or bacterial toxins for 1 to 4 hours , followed by C5a stimulation for 2 hours .
Cells were harvested , and pellets were resuspended in 1 mL TRI-reagent ( Molecular Research Center , Inc , Cincinnati , OH ) for total RNA isolation .
For Northern blot , 10 ug of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in a gel containing 1.2 % agarose and 6.6 % formaldehyde as denaturing agent .
The RNA was then transferred to nylon membrane and fixed by short-wave UV radiation .
The Northern blot was prehybridized for 1 hour in the ExpressHyb solution ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) and hybridized with a IL-8 DNA fragment at 1 % 10° cpm/mL .
Hybridization was performed at 65°C for 3 hours in the ExpressHyb solution .
The blot was washed twice in 0.5 % standard sodium citrate solution with 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65°C for 15 minutes .
The blot was then stripped and rehybridized with a [ e-P ] dCTP-labeled B-actin cDNA for equal loading control .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Freshly isolated PBMC were placed at a density of 5 X 10° in round-bottom culture tubes and stimulated with C5a .
After stimulation , cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , harvested , and resuspended in 0.4 mL of buffer A ( 10 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.9 , 10 mmol/L KCI , 0.1 mmol/L EDTA , 0.1 mmol/L EGTA , 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol , and 0.5 mmol/L phenolmethylsulfony ] fluoride ( PMSF ) .
After 10 minute , 23 uL of 10 % Nonidet P-40 was added and mixed for 2 seconds .
Nuclei were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 13,0008 for 10 seconds and resuspended in 50 uL of buffer B ( 20 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.9 , 0.4 mol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 1 mmol/L EGTA , and 0.1 mmol/L PMSF ) .
After 30 minutes at 4°C , lysates were separated by centrifugation at 13,000g for 30 minutes , and supernatant containing nuclear proteins was aliquoted and stored at -80°C .
The protein concentration of HSU ET AL extracts was measured using the BCA protein dye reagent ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) with bovine serum albumin as standard .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .
EMSA were performed by incubating 2.5 ug of nuclear extract in 12 uL of binding buffer [ 5 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.9 , 5 mmol/L MgCl ; , 50 mmol/L KCI , 0.5 mmol/L dithiothreitol , 0.4 mg/mL poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) , 0.1 mg/mL sonicated double-stranded salmon sperm DNA , and 10 % glycerol ] for 10 minutes at room temperature .
`` °P-labeled oligonucleotide probe ( 30,000 cpm ) was then added , and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 10 minutes at room temperature .
For reactions involving competitive oligonucleotides , the unlabeld competitor , at 100-fold molar excess , and the labeled probe were premixed before addition to the reaction mixture .
For supershift assays , the reaction mixture minus the probe was incubated with 2 uL of specific antibodies to proteins for 30 minutes at room temperature .
The *P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was then added and incubation was continued for 15 minutes .
The samples were analyzed on 6 % acrylamide gels .
The gels were pre-electrophoresed at 12 V/cm for 1.5 hours at room temperature and 0.5 hours in a cold room , and the electrophoresis was continued at the same voltage for another 2 hours at room temperature .
Gel contents were transferred to Whatman chromatography paper ( Markson Lab Sales , Hillsboro , OR ) , dried , and exposed to a PhosphorImage screen ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) for 3 hours .
Cell culture and transfection .
- The murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , 100 IU/mL penicillin , 50 ug/mL streptomycin , and 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO ; environment .
RAW264.7 cells were cotransfected , by electroporation , with reporter gene plasmid DNA and the control plasmid pCMV f. For each transfection , a total of 10 ug supercoiled DNA was added to 2 X 10 '' cells resuspended in 0.2 mL of fresh growth medium in an electroporation cuvette with 0.4-cm gap and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes .
Electroporation was performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) , with voltage and capacitance settings of 300 V ( 750 V/cm ) and 960 uF , respectively .
The cells were collected immediately after electroporation , seeded in 2 mL growth medium , and cultured overnight in a 6-well plate until starvation and stimulation .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assay .
Eight micro-grams of each CAT reporter construct DNA and 2 ug of the control plasmid pCMVJB were cotransfected into 2 X 10 '' RAW264.7 cells by electroporation .
In experiments with a dominant negative IxBa construct ( kindly provided by Dr D. Van Antwerp and I. Verma , The Salk Institute , La Jolla , CA ) , 4 ug of the plasmid DNA was cotransfected with a CAT reporter .
Sixteen hours after transfection , the cells were washed with serum-free medium , replaced with starvation medium ( RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , 100 IU/mL penicillin , 50 ug/ml streptomycin , and 0.5 % fetal bovine serum ) , and cultured for 4 hours .
Cells were then stimulated with C5a ( 100 nmol/L ) for 2 to 6 hours in the starvation medium and collected in 100 uL of 0.25 mol/L Tris ( pH 7.8 ) followed by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw .
CAT activities were measured in crude cellular extracts using [ '*C ] chloramphenicol ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) as substrate and thin-layer chromatography to separate the native form from acetylated form .
Relative transfection efficiency was determined by normalizing the CAT activity to B-galactosidase activity measured in cell extracts from the cotransfected pCMV B. Calcium mobilization assay .
Cells were treated with or without pertussis toxin ( 100 ng/mL , or as indicated in the figures ) for 16 hours , harvested with trypsin-free cell dissociation buffer ( GIBCO-BRL ) , and loaded with Indo-1 ( 5 pmol/L ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) by incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle rocking .

STIMULATION OF NF- « B AND IL-8 EXPRESSION eter ( SLM-Aminco , Urbana , IL ) detecting at 400 and 490 nm , with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm .
RESULTS C5a stimulates synthesis of immunoreactive IL-8 from PBMC .
Freshly prepared human PBMC were stimulated with C5a at various concentrations and IL-8 secreted into the supernatant was measured by ELISA .
Figure 1 shows that unstimulated PBMC did not produce detectable IL-8 , whereas cells incubated with 100 nmol/L of recombinant human CSa produced up to 1,200 pg/mL of IL-8 .
CS5a induction of IL-8 secretion was dose-dependent , detectable with 12.5 nmol/L of CSa and peaking at an agonist concentration of 500 nmol/L .
PBMC from at least 6 different donors gave similar results ( Fig 1 ) .
Natural C5a , purified from human serum , gave nearly identical results ( data not shown ) .
The IL-8 secreted into the culture medium increased rapidly in the first 2 hours of CS5a stimulation , reaching 14-fold above the level of an unstimulated culture ( Fig 2 ) .
This rapid increase in IL-8 secretion suggests a direct effect of C5a on IL-8 production .
IL-8 level in unstimulated culture remained low ( < 100 pg/mL ) during the time period of investigation .
These results are consistent with a previous report indicating C5a induction of IL-8 production in monocytes . ''
CS5a stimulates transcription of the IL-8 gene .
To investigate whether the induction of IL-8 by C5a is at the transcriptional level , PBMC were treated with various transcription and translation inhibitors for 1 hour before C5a stimulation .
After 2 hours of incubation with CSa , the supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-8 by ELISA .
As shown in Fig 3 , CSa-stimulated IL-8 secretion was blocked almost completely by the translation inhibitor cyelohexamide ( CHX ) and by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D ( ActD ) .
These data suggest that C5a-mediated production of IL-8 from PBMC is the result of de novo protein synthesis and not the release of a preformed 1800 & d € : 2 17 5 3 1 & ‘ gs e » 1 i w - 4 2 0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 CSa ( nM ) Fig 1 .

This was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis using total RNA isolated from PBMC after 2 hours of C5a stimulation in the absence or presence of the above-noted inhibitors .
As shown in Fig 4 , C5a stimulated cytosolic accumulation of IL-8 mRNA ( lane 3 v lane 1 ) .
Both IL-8 protein secretion and mRNA accumulation were not only inhibited by ActD , but also reduced by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , a potent inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-KB ( Fig 4 , lanes 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 IL-8 secretion ( pg/ml ) Basal TNF CS @ a PDTC ActD CHX PTX Fig 3 .

CSa-induced increase in cytosolic IL-8 mRNA .

4 and 5 ) .
This result suggests the involvement of nuclear factor xB ( NF-kB ) in C5a-induced transcriptional activation of IL-8 gene .
CSa-induced nuclear expression of a « kB DNA binding activity is primarily responsible for the early stage transcriptional activation of IL-8 gene .
The IL-8 gene consists of 4 exons and 3 introns with a single TATA box and a CAT box .
The 5'-flanking region contains potential binding sites for known transcription factors AP-1 , AP-2 , NF-IL-6 , and NF-kB . ''
The sequence from -94 to -81 on IL-8 gene promoter shows similarity with potential binding site for NF-IL-6 ( CAGTTG-CAAATCGT ) , and the sequence from -82 to -70 ( GTG-GAATTTCCTC ) is homologous to the consensus binding element for as in the genes for Ig x light chain , SV40 and HIV ( GGGGACTTTCC ) . '' '' ''
NF- « B has been shown to play an important role in the transcription of genes for many inflammatory factors , '' including the IL-8 gene . ''
It was therefore important to determine whether CSa is capable of activating this transcription factor as well as other factors known to cooperate with NF-kB in IL-8 gene expression , including AP-1 and NF-IL-6 .
PBMC were stimulated with C5a or with the control agonists TNFa and LPS , and nuclear extracts were prepared for gel mobility shift assays using *°P-labeled probes for NF-kB , AP-1 , and NF-IL-6 .
As shown in Fig 5 , exposure of PBMC to CSa resulted in a marked increase in both kB and AP-1 binding activities .
However , the expression of these binding activities followed different time courses .
The kB binding activity was strongly expressed within 30 minutes after C5a stimulation and reached its peak in 60 minutes .
However , the AP-1 binding activity was apparent 4 hours after stimulation ( Fig 5 , HSU ET AL middle panel ) .
C5a did not stimulate NFE-IL-6 binding activity for up to 4 hours , whereas LPS induced a strong NP-IL-6 binding activity in these cells ( Fig 5 , lower panel ) .
Because of the rapid increase in both IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in the first 2 hours after C5a stimulation ( Fig 2 ) , the above-noted results suggest that C5a-induced NF-KB is most relevant to the early stage IL-8 gene expression in PBMC .
To test the specificity of C5a-induced « kB binding activity , an excess amount of unlabeled « B oligonucleotide was used in gel mobility shift assays .
Unlabeled xB oligonucleotide , at 100-fold molar excess , successfully competed with the labeled probe , whereas a 100-fold molar excess of the AP-1 oligonucleotide had no effect on xB binding activity ( Fig 6 , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
The two protein components of the prototypic NF-kB , p65 ( RelA ) and p50 ( NFKB1 ) , were found to be the constituents in supershift assays by inclusion of anti-p50 and anti-p65 poly-clonal antibodies ( Fig 6 , lanes 6 through 8 ) .
Antibody-induced supershift was blocked by incubation with the p50 and p65 peptides , to which the antibodies were generated , indicating specificity of the antibodies for p50 and p65 ( lane 9 ) .
These results demonstrated that CSa induces activation of NF-kB containing the p50 and p65 subunits .

Lane 9 contains anti-p50 and anti-p65 plus the neutralizing peptides used for antibody production .
Samples were analyzed by EMSA , using 6 % acrylamide gel and P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF- « B binding site consensus sequence .
The gel supershift bands induced by the anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies were indicated with arrow s. xB-CAT ( chloramphenical acetyltransferase ) reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected into the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 , which expresses CSa receptor .
The CAT activities were determined 48 hours after transfection .
As shown in Fig 7 , C5a induced a sixfold increase in CAT activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type IxBa promoter-CAT construct , pO.2kb ( WT ) JCAT ( lane 3 v lane 2 ) , which contains one copy of a kB site ( GGAAATTCCC ) .
`` ° There was no increase in CAT activity in cells transfected with a mutant IxBa construct [ pO.2kb ( M ) CAT ; CGAAATTAAT ; Fig 7 , lane 4 ] .
The IL-8 promoter-driven CAT constructs were next used to examine the direct effect of CSa on IL-8 gene expression .
C5a induced a 14-fold increase in CAT activity in cells transfected with an IL-8 promoter reporter p-272CAT , which contains 272 3245 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site ( Fig 7 , lane 6 v lane 5 ) .
The reporter construct harbors NF-kB , NF-IL-6 , and AP-1 sites . '' ''
To determine whether NF-KB plays a crucial function in CSa-induced IL-8 gene expression , another reporter construct , p-94 ( A78-71 ) CAT was used .
In this construct , a critical part of the kB binding sequence ( underlined in GTG-GAATTITTCCTC ) was removed , resulting in a plasmid containing all other DNA binding sites except a functional kB site .
Cells transfected with this construct did not show C5a inducible CAT activity ( Fig 7 , lane 8 v lane 7 ) .
Therefore , the xB site in the 5 ' flanking region of IL-8 gene is indispensable for CS5a-stimulated IL-8 gene transcription .
NF-KB activation results from phosphorylation and degradation of the IB proteins .
`` ' > '' Prevention of IxBa phosphorylation leads to inhibition of NF-kB activation . ''
To establish a function of C5a-induced NF-KB activation in IL-8 transcription , RAW264.7 cells were cotransfected with the p-272CAT reporter and a dominant negative form of ( IBM ) , in which Serq ) and Serge were mutated to block agonist-induced IxBa phosphorylation and subsequent NF-kB activation . ''
Coexpression of IxBaM completely blocked CSa-induced expression of the p-272CAT gene ( Fig 8 , lane 4 ) , indicating involvement of IxBa phosphorylation and NF-KB activation in CSa-stimulated IL-8 gene expression .
Additional evidence supporting a critical role of NF-kB activation in CSa-induced IL-8 gene transcription was obtained by using the NF-KB inhibitor PDTC , which effectively blocked C5a-stimulated CAT activity using the p-272CAT construct ( Fig 9 , lane 5 ) .
Similarly , the transcription inhibitor ActD and the translation inhibitor CHX also abolished CSa induction of CAT activity ( Fig 9 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive and insensitive pathways in C5a stimulation of IL-8 gene expression .
- The chemotactic function of C5a , like that of other chemoattractants , is known to be mediated through coupling of its 7-transmembrane domain receptor with the G ; class of G protein « -subunits that are sensitive to pertussis toxin ( PTX ) treatment . '' ''

`` * '' 8 The involvement of G ; proteins in CSa-induced IL-8 gene expression was examined in cells treated with PTX , which ADP-ribosylates and inhibits the activities of the G ; and G , proteins .
Results from both ELISA and Northern blotting indicated only a partial blockade ( ~20 % ) of IL-8 secretion and IL-8 mRNA accumulation in the toxin-treated cells ( Figs 3 and 4 ) .
In control experiments , the same pertussis toxin treatment was sufficient to block CSa-induced calcium mobilization and MAP kinase activation in neutrophils ( data not shown ) .
Consistent with the results from ELISA and Northern blot experiments shown above , PTX had a very small inhibitory effect on CSa-induced CAT activity ( Fig 9 , lane 6 compared with lane 2 ) .
These findings suggest that C5a-induced IL-8 gene expression is mediated primarily through G , , proteins insensitive to PTX treatment .
Alternatively , a pathway independent of G protein activation may be involved in activating NF-kB .
To examine these possibilities , calcium mobilization assay was adopted , because CSa-induced increase of intracellular Ca*+* level is known to follow G protein and phospholipase C activation .

DISCUSSION The anaphylatoxin CSa has been previously shown to induce the synthesis and secretion of a number of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1B and However , how CSa regulates the biosynthesis of these cytokines remains unclear .
Results from this work provide direct evidence for CSa activation of NF-kB in PBMC and in a transfected macrophage cell line .
Thus , NF-KB activation may be an important mediator of CSa-induced transcriptional activation of these cytokines genes , which all contain < B-binding sequence in their promoter regions . ''
This notion is supported by the finding that CSa stimulates IL-8 secretion , which peaks at 2 hours after agonist stimulation and follows NP- « B activation , which reaches maximum within 1 hour ( Figs 2 and 5 ) .
Further attesting to the role of NF-KB in IL-8 gene expression , the antioxidant inhibitor of NF-kB , PDTC , markedly reduces C5a-induced IL-8 secretion and IL-8 message accumulation .
The effective inhibition of NF-KB activation by a dominant negative IxBa mutant suggests a direct role of C5a stimulation of IxBa phosphorylation , which leads to NF-kB activation and IL-8 expression .
Although CSa also stimulates AP-1 binding activity , the time course of AP-1 activation differs significantly from that of NF- « B and can not account for the early phase ( within 2 hours ) upregulation of IL-8 at the protein and mRNA levels .
The current work does not rule out the possibility that AP-1 activation contributes to IL-8 gene expression in the late phase , as was reported in several previous studies . '' ''
The observed 14-fold increase in CAT activity with the p-272CAT construct compared with a sixfold increase using the 0.2-kb ( WT ) JCAT construct supports a synergistic function of AP-1 in IL-8 gene expression with prolonged CSa stimulation , as was the condition used in CAT assays .
Previously published studies demonstrate that NF-IL-6 can act synergistically with NF-KB to enhance IL-8 transcrip- 3247 tion in a cell type-dependent manner , but NF-IL6 alone is insufficient for IL-8 gene expression . '' ''
However , in this study , C5a did not induce detectable NF-IL6 activation ; therefore , the function of NF-IL-6 in IL-8 expression may be negligible .
Our results suggest a critical role of NF-kB activation in CSa-stimulated IL-8 gene expression , because a reporter construct with a defective kB site did not respond to CSa stimulation despite the presence of the AP-1 and NF-IL-6 sites ( Fig 7 ) .
The actions of CSa are mediated by the G-protein-coupled C5a receptor expressed in granulocytes , monocytes , and several other types of cells .
The C5a receptor is known to couple to G ; proteins that are sensitive to pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation and G protein inactivation .
In reported studies , PTX treatment abolishes C5Sa mediated functions such as chemotaxis , degranulation , and superoxide generation ( reviewed in Gerard and Gerard '' ) .
A surprising finding from this study is the lack of complete inhibition by PTX of CSa-stimulated NF- « B activation and IL-8 secretion .
Using calcium mobilization as an assay for G-protein-coupled response , we demonstrated that C5a receptor can couple to either PTX-sensitive or PTX-insensitive G proteins depending on cell types .
The two likely candidates for PTX-insensitive G proteins are G , , , and GyJ4 , being both present in mononuclear cells and insensitive to PTX treatment .
Gy ; 4 has been shown in a previous report to couple to CSa receptor in transiently transfected COS-7 and 293 cells , '' '' '' 8 making it a more likely candidate for the G protein that transduces C5a-induced signaling leading to transcription activation .
This study provides an example of coupling of a chemoattractant receptor to PTX-insensitive G protein -subunit ( s ) that effectively mediates a cellular re-sponse .
Based on our data , we can not rule out the possibility that C5a induces IL-8 gene expression without activating G proteins in the RAW264.7 cells .
It will be important to further investigate the possible presence of a G-protein-independent pathway and to understand the structural basis for CSa receptor coupling to multiple G , , proteins that leads to different cellular responses .
Activation of NF-kB and other transcription factors for immediate-early genes provides an effective means for chemoattractant stimulated upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines .
Results from the current study suggest that , in addition to a synergistic role of C:5a in LPS-induced cytokine production , '* '' '' this peptide agonist can directly induce NF-xB activation that leads to biosynthesis of IL-8 .
A rapid induction of IL-8 biosynthesis after C5a stimulation supports a direct action of this chemoattractant on IL-8 gene expression .
Because chemoat-tractants are molecules that leukocytes encounter at an early stage of inflammation , their effect on cytokine gene expression may influence the course of inflammation .
By induction of IL-8 expression , a chemoattractant such as C5a and fMet-Leu-Phe can stimulate the generation of a potent chemotactic cytokine that , in turn , may attract additional phagocytes and lymphocytes to the site of inflammation .
Recent studies conducted in our laboratory demonstrate that IL-8 produced by mononuclear cells may also regulate the secretion of other cytokines , including IL-8 itself .
IL-8 binding to the IL-8 receptors can lead to transcription activation and an autocrine regulation of IL-8 biosynthesis ( unpublished result ) .
Additional efforts will be required to understand the mechanisms by which chemoat- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .
