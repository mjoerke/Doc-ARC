Paul , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , May 10 , 1995 ABSTRACT Interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) is an important im-munoregulatory cytokine whose receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily .
We have recently demonstrated that stimulation of human T and natural killer cells with IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK2 and Tyk2 , implicating these kinases in the immediate biochemical response to IL-12 .
Recently , transcription factors known as STATs ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) have been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to a number of cytokines that bind hematopoietin receptors and activate JAK kinases .
In this report we demonstrate that IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a recently identified STAT family member , STAT4 , and show that STAT4 expression is regulated by T-cell activation .
Furthermore , we show that IL-12 stimulates formation of a DNA-binding complex that recognizes a DNA sequence previously shown to bind STAT proteins and that this complex contains STAT4 .
These data , and the recent demonstration of JAK phosphorylation by IL-12 , identify a rapid signal-transduction pathway likely to mediate IL-12-induced gene expression .
Interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) is a monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokine ( 1 , 2 ) , which , through its many effects on natural killer ( NK ) and T lymphocytes , plays a central role in the initiation and control of cell-mediated immune responses ( 3 , 4 ) .
The receptor for IL-12 ( IL-12R ) is incompletely characterized , although a low-affinity subunit has recently been cloned ( 5 ) .
This subunit is a member of the hematopoietin receptor family , closely related to gp130 .
Like other family members , binding of IL-12 to the IL-12R induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a range of intracellular substrates ( 6 , 7 ) .
However , hematopoietin receptors do not possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity but instead associate with and activate members of the Janus ( JAK ) family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases ( 8-12 ) .
We have recently demonstrated that IL-12 treatment of human T and NK cells leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of both JAK2 and Tyk2 kinases , implicating these kinases in the immediate biochemical response to IL-12 ( 6 ) .
The biological effects of IL-12 include the rapid activation of early-response genes such as interferon y ( IFN-y ) and perforin ( 3 , 4 ) , but the molecular mechanisms by which IL-12 might stimulate transcription are not known .
A number of recent studies have identified a family of transcription factors called STAT 's ( signal transducers and activators of transcrip-tion ) , which are involved in the signal-transduction cascades of The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

7307 many cytokines known to activate JAK kinases ( 8 , 13-15 ) .
Originally described as mediators of IFN-induced transcrip-tion , STATs are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that , after tyrosine phosphorylation , translocate to the nucleus and bind specific , but related , DNA sequences to promote transcription of cytokine-responsive genes ( 13 ) .
IFN- induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 , which associate with a nuclear 48-kDa DNA-binding protein to form a multiprotein transcriptional activator known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 ( 16 , 17 ) .
In contrast , IFN-y promotes tyrosine phosphorylation and homodimerization of STAT1 , which translocates to the nucleus and directly binds to a conserved sequence motif termed the IFN-y-activation site ( 18 ) .
Ligand binding to many hematopoietin receptors has now been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT family proteins , thereby promoting their ability to bind IFN-y-activation site-related DNA sequences : the IL-6 family of cytokines activate both STAT1 and STAT3 ( 19 , 20 ) , prolactin activates STAT1 ( 21 ) and STATS ( 22 ) , and IL-4 activates a STAT protein designated IL-4-STAT ( STAT6 ) ( 23 ) .
STAT4 is another family member with restricted distribution , being expressed mainly by myeloid cells and developing spermatogonia and also in thymus and spleen ( 24 , 25 ) .
To date , no STAT4-activating ligand has been identified .
In this study we sought to determine whether STAT proteins could be identified in the signal-transduction pathway of IL-12 .
Stimulation of human T cells with IL-12 induced early tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 but not of STAT1 or STAT2 .
Moreover , electrophoretic mobility-shift assays ( EMSAs ) identified an IL-12-induced DNA-binding complex that contained STATA4 .
These results suggest that IL-12 might activate transcription by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 .

Cell Culture and Activation .
Normal human T cells ( 94 + 5 % CD3* ) were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described ( 26 ) .
Fresh NK cells were negatively selected from low-density Percoll fractions using anti-CD3 antibodies coupled to magnetic beads ( MACS ; Miltenyi Biotechnology , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
To induce IL-12 responsiveness , T cells were cultured for 3 days in RPMI 1640 medium/10 % fetal calf serum/phytohem-agglutinin ( PHA ) at 2 pg/ml ( Sigma ) , split 1:1 with fresh medium , and then cultured for an additional day with IL-2 at 50 international units/ml ( 27 ) .
The human T-cell line Kit 225 ( subclone K6 ) ( 28 ) was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium/10 % fetal calf serum /IL-2 at 100 international units/ml .
Before stimulation with cytokines , activated T cells and Kit 225/K6 cells were washed in acidified RPMI 1640 medium ( pH 6.4 ) and rested for 4 hr in RPMI 1640 medium/0.5 % human AB serum or 2 % fetal calf serum , respec-tively .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Like many other members of the hematopoietin receptor family , the IL-12 receptor is functionally coupled to members of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases .
We have previously reported that IL-12 treatment of PHA-activated human T cells induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of both Tyk2 and JAK2 , implicating these kinases in the early signal-transduction events after interaction of IL-12 with its receptor ( 6 ) .
Many cytokines that activate JAK kinases induce the binding of STAT proteins to a series of palindromic IFN-y-activation site-related DNA oligonucleotides with the consensus sequence TTNCNNNAA ( 14 , 15 ) .
Therefore , we investigated by EMSA whether IL-12 might also induce such DNA-binding complexes in human lymphocytes .
Whole-cell extracts from untreated or cytokine-treated PHA-activated T cells were examined for binding to a probe corresponding to the GRR of the human Foy receptor I gene that has been shown to bind a number of cytokine-activated nuclear factors ( 14 , 31 ) .
Extracts from untreated PHA-stimulated human T cells contained three GRR-binding complexes designated here as A , B , and C ( Fig .
14 , lane 1 ) .
Treatment of T cells with IL-12 induced a more slowly migrating complex , which we have called IL-12-stimulated factor ( IL-12SF ) , which appeared within 5 min of stimulation and was still present after 45 min ( Fig .
14 , lanes 2-4 ) .
In this experiment , band C was only weakly detectable in untreated cells and was modestly enhanced by IL-12 treatment .
However , this was not a consistent finding ; in most donors band C was detectable in untreated cells and was unaffected by treatment with IL-12 ( data not shown ) .
The significance of complex C to the IL-12 response therefore remains unclear .

present in unstimulated cells from any of the donors examined and was induced in all donors by IL-12 treatment .
Stimulation of the same cells with either IFN-a ( Fig .
14 , lane 5 ) or IL-6 ( lane 6 ) induced a complex that migrated at approximately the same position as IL-12SF .
IL-12SF , complexes A-C , and the complexes induced by IFN-a and IL-6 each bound specifically to the labeled GRR sequence .
These complexes could be displaced by competition with unlabeled GRR oligonucleotide ( Fig .
1B , lanes 3 and 4 ) but not with an unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the ISRE ( lanes 5 and 6 ) or with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the DNA-binding site of the transcription factor AP-1 ( data not shown ) .
The ability of STAT proteins to bind to target DNA elements depends upon their tyrosine phosphorylation ( 14 , 34 ) , and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 binds to GRR in response to IFN-y and other cytokines ( 14 , 30 ) .
To determine whether IL-12 could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT2 , which might be components of IL-12SF ( Fig .
1B ) , lysates from untreated or cytokine-treated PHA-activated T cells were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to STAT1 or STAT2 , resolved by SDS/PAGE , and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting ( Fig .
24 , Upper ) .
As expected , IFN-a « induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 ( lane 3 ) and STAT2 ( lane 6 ) .
In response to IFN-a , STAT1 and STAT2 associate in a transcriptional complex known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 ( 16 , 17 ) .
Con-sequently , the anti-STAT2 antiserum used was able to coim-munoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT 1 from IFNa-treated cells ( Fig .
24 , lane 6 ) as described ( 17 ) .
In contrast to IFN-a , IL-12 treatment caused tyrosine phosphorylation of neither STAT1 ( Fig .
24 , lane 2 ) nor STAT2 ( lane 5 ) .
The presence of equal levels of STAT1 and STAT2 in each lane was demonstrated by stripping these blots and reprobing with antiserum against STAT1 and STAT2 , respectively ( Fig .
24 , Lower ) .
These data suggest that STAT1 and STAT2 are not activated by IL-12 in T cells and are unlikely to be components of the IL-12SF complex .
STAT4 is a recently identified STAT family member expressed in hematopoietic tissues , including thymus and spleen , but not in a number of murine T cell lines tested or in many other tissues ( 24 , 25 ) .
To investigate whether STAT4 could potentially be a component of the IL-12-induced GRR-binding complex ( IL-12SF ) , we first analyzed by immunoblotting its expression in human T cells .
Fresh peripheral T cells from a number of donors expressed either low or undetectable levels of STAT4 protein by immunoblotting ( Fig .
2B , lane 1 ) .
However , T cells only express IL-12R and respond functionally to IL-12 after activation with agents such as PHA ( 35 ) .
Moreover , components of other cytokine signaling pathways , such as IL-2 receptor a chain and JAK 3 , are strongly up-regulated by T-cell activation ( 9 , 36 ) .
We therefore examined STAT4 expression in T cells stimulated for various times with PHA .
PHA induced expression of STAT4 protein in a time-dependent manner ; maximal induction was observed after 72 hr of stimulation ( Fig .
2B ) .
Interestingly , this time course of STAT4 expression mirrors closely the kinetics of induction of IL-12R expression on T cells by PHA , as well as the acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness ( 35 ) , suggesting that STAT4 might be involved in IL-12 signal transduction in activated T cells .
Furthermore , STAT4 was found to be expressed in other IL-12-responsive cells : fresh peripheral NK cells , Kit 225/K6 cells , and the NK3.3 cell line ( 37 ) ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , fresh tonsillar B cells and the NK-like cell line YT , which do not respond to IL-12 , did not express STAT4 ( data not shown ) .
Together , these data suggested the possible involvement of STAT4 in IL-12 signal transduction .
To more directly establish a role for STAT4 in IL-12 signaling , the ability of IL-12 to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 was assessed .
STAT4 was immunoprecipitated from cytokine-treated or -untreated IL-12-responsive Proc .

Recently it has been proposed that STAT proteins ( 39 , 42 ) , like a number of other transcription factors ( 43 ) , may be regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation , and it is intriguing to consider that phosphorylation of serine/ threonine as well as tyrosine residues might contribute to the regulation of STAT4 function .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 in response to IL-12 suggests that the IL-12SF detected by EMSA might contain STAT4 .
To test this directly , EMSAs were done in which antibodies to STAT4 or control antibodies were included in the DNA-binding reaction before addition of P-labeled probe ( Fig .
3C ) .
Antiserum to STAT4 ( lane 3 ) , but not a control antiserum ( lane 4 ) , was able to supershift the IL-12SF complex , indicating that IL-12SF contained STAT4 .
In contrast , and in agreement with the tyrosine phosphorylation data shown in Fig .
24 , antiserum to STAT1 supershifted the IFN- « -induced GRR-binding complex but had no effect on IL-12SF ( data not shown ) .
Antiserum to STAT4 had no effect on the constitutive GRR-binding complexes A-C or on the complexes induced by either IL-6 or IFN-a « ( data not shown ) , indicating that these do not contain STAT4 and are therefore different in composition from IL-12SF .
However , although IL-12 is the only reported inducer of STAT4 activation , the expression of STAT4 in myeloid cells and in developing spermatogonia ( 24 ) suggests that other STAT4 activating ligands might exist .
A number of cytokines that signal via JAK kinases have recently been shown to induce activation of STATs ( 8 , 13-15 ) .
Analysis of JAK-deficient cell lines has shown that JAK kinases are necessary for phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to IFNs ( 44 , 45 ) , and over-expression of JAKs can activate STAT DNA-binding activity ( 46 ) .
Data such as these suggest that JAK kinases might directly regulate STAT proteins , and the `` JAK-STAT '' pathway has been proposed as a paradigm for cytokine signaling .
In this paper we have shown that IL-12 stimulation of human lymphocytes induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 but not of STAT1 or STAT2 .
Moreover , IL-12 stimulates the formation of nuclear complexes that bind to the GRR DNA sequence , and these complexes contain STAT4 .
Together with our previous finding that IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and Tyk2 ( 6 ) , these data suggest that a specific JAK-STAT pathway may transduce rapid and direct IL-12 signals to the nuclei of responsive cells and provide a clear basis for understanding the mechanisms by which IL-12 might regulate gene expression .
The mechanisms controlling the induction of genes such as IFN-y and perforin by IL-12 are still very poorly characterized , and it will be interesting to analyze the function of STAT4 in these responses .
Some cytokines , including IL-6 and epidermal growth factor , promote tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of more than one STAT protein ( 19 , 20 ) .
Epidermal growth factor , for example , causes activation of STAT1 and STAT3 , which can bind DNA as either homo- or heterodimers ( 20 ) .
Whether STAT4 forms homo- or heterodimers upon activation by IL-12 is unclear .
Our data suggest that STAT1 and STAT2 are not phosphorylated or activated in response to IL-12 ( Fig .
24 ) , but we can not rule out that other STAT family members ( or unrelated proteins ) might also be components of IL-12SF or that IL-12 might induce binding of distinct STATs to other DNA sequences .
In fact , preliminary data suggest that in some cell types , IL-12 can also stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 ( data not shown ) .
However , the level of STAT3 phosphorylation detected is minimal in comparison with that induced by IL-6 and IFN-a , and the significance of this finding is as yet unclear .
Little STAT4 is expressed in resting human T cells , which express negligible surface levels of IL-12R ( 35 ) .
However , STAT4 protein levels are increased dramatically upon activation of T cells by PHA with a time course similar to the induction of IL-12R expression and the acquisition of IL-12 responsiveness ( 35 ) .
A similar pattern of expression has been Immunology : Bacon et a/ .
previously described for components of the IL-2 signaling path-way , in which both IL-2Ra and JAK3 are induced in T cells with a time course parallel to that of IL-2 responsiveness ( 9 , 36 ) .
Together , these data indicate that components of cytokine signaling complexes can be coordinately regulated in T cells .
It is possible that such coregulation of signaling molecules is one mechanism by which peripheral blood T cells control cytokine responsiveness during the inflammatory immune response .
IL-2 and IL-12 exert many similar biological effects on NK and T cells , including the induction of common genes such as IFN-y and perforin ( 3 , 4 ) .
However , the molecular mechanisms underlying this similarity are unclear .
Although JAK2 and Tyk2 are implicated in IL-12 responses ( 6 ) , IL-2 stimulates the activation of JAK1 and JAK3 ( 10 , 11 , 47 ) .
Moreover , while IL-12 , but not IL-2 , triggers activation of STAT4 , IL-2 activates distinct STATs ( 48 ) which we and others have recently identified as STAT3 and STATS ( 49-51 ) .
Similarly , although IL-12 and IFNs a and y have many similar effects on lymphocytes , these cytokines differ biochemically in that the IFNs , but not IL-12 , activate STAT1 .
It is likely that the activation of different JAKs and STAT 's by these cytokines is dictated by the differential ability of these molecules to bind to each cytokine 's receptor ( 52 ) .
Further investigation of the ways in which distinct signaling pathways such as these converge to produce common effects should lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cytokines control the immune response .
