While in most cell types , activation requires interaction of Tat with the unusual transcription element TAR , astrocytic glial cells support TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat .
This alternative pathway of Tat activation is mediated by the viral enhancer , a « B domain capable of binding the prototypical form of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-KB ) present in many cell types , including T lymphocytes .
Tat transactivation mediated by the « B domain is sufficient to allow replication of TAR-deleted mutant HIV-1 in astrocytes .
The present study demonstrates the existence of « B-specific binding factors present in human glial astrocytes that differ from prototypical NF- « B .
The novel astrocyte-derived < B-binding activity is retained on an HIV-1 Tat affinity column , while prototypical NF-B from Jurkat T cells is not .
In vitro transcription studies demonstrate that astrocyte-derived « B-binding factors activate transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and that this activation is dependent on the B domain .
Moreover , TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription is reproduced in vitro in an astrocyte factor-dependent manner which correlates with « B-binding activity .
The importance of the central nervous system-enriched « B transcription factor in the regulation of HIV-1 expression is discussed .
The tat gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is essential for viral replication ( 16 , 20 ) .
Tat is expressed early in the viral life cycle and serves as a potent activator of transcription directed by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , leading to the increased expression of all viral genes ( 1 , 54 ) .
Tat binds to a specific RNA structure , termed the TAR element , found at the 5 end of all HIV-1 mRNAs ( 12 , 13 , 39 , 49 ) .
Experiments carried out with a limited number of cell types , primarily HeLa cells and T-lymphocytic cell lines , indicate that the interaction of Tat with this specific RNA target is an important component of the activation mechanism ( 8 , 12 , 13 ) .
It has been suggested that binding to TAR serves to localize Tat to the vicinity of the promoter , where it interacts with unspecified targets , resulting in enhanced transcriptional initiation ( 53 ) .
This model of Tat function is consistent with results implicating the participation of specific upstream regulatory elements of the viral LTR , such as the kB domain and the GC-rich Spl-binding sites , in Tat transactivation ( 7 , 30 , 55 ) , as well as with kinetic studies which suggest that a transient interaction between Tat and nascent TAR RNA is sufficient for achieving wild-type levels of transactivation ( 7 , 8 , 28 , 30 , 53 , 55 ) .
Recently , a number of reports have suggested that the primary function of Tat is to increase the efficiency of transcriptional elongation ( 19 , 36 ) .
The ability of Tat to influence elongation seems surprising in light of evidence that the target of Tat function is at the promoter ( 7 , 30 , 52 , 55 ) and that the kinetics of Tat function indicate an effect at the time of , or immediately after , initiation of transcription ( 28 ) .
In an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox , it has been proposed * Corresponding author .

3971 that Tat functions at the promoter of HIV-1 , requiring the participation of upstream regulatory elements , and biases initiation towards the formation of `` more-processive '' transcription complexes ( 22 ) .
The clinical course of HIV disease is frequently complicated by multiple disorders of the central nervous system ( CNS ) ( 47 , 48 ) .
At least 60 % of AIDS patients exhibit clinical symptoms of neurologic disease , and 90 % demonstrate neuropathologic abnormalities at autopsy ( 32 , 42 ) .
While HIV-1 predominantly infects microglial cells in the CNS , viral antigens have also been detected in astrocytes in vivo ( 25 , 57 ) , and it has been demonstrated that HIV-1 infects glial astrocytes in vitro ( 14 , 15 , 17 ) .
Studies examining the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression in cells derived from the CNS revealed that glial astrocytes support TAR-independent activation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat ( 60 ) .
The alternative pathway of Tat utilization in glial astrocytes was found to allow HIV-1 replication to circumvent the requirement for a functional TAR element ( 6 , 60 ) .
We further determined that the RNA-binding domain of Tat protein was dispensable for TAR-independent transactivation but that the activation domain of the protein remained necessary ( 59 ) .
The kB domain within the HIV-1 LTR , also referred to as the viral enhancer , was determined to be Tat responsive within astrocytes , conferring Tat responsiveness to heterologous promoters and permitting TAR-independent replication of HIV-1 ( 6 , 60 ) .
These observations clearly differed from many previous reports concerning lymphocytes and monocytes , where TAR is reported to be absolutely essential for Tat transactivation and viral replication , and suggested the potential for differential utilization of kB elements within astrocytes .
Further , these observations may provide insight 3972 TAYLOR ET AL .
into the mechanism by which Tat influences cellular gene expression .
The HIV-1 enhancer found between nucleotides -80 and -105 of the viral LTR contains two tandem repeats of the decanucleotide sequence 5-GGGACTTTCC-3 ' which have been found to bind two copies of the transcription factor NF- « B .
Induction of NF-kB binding is responsible for the increased HIV-1 transcription observed upon activation of T lymphocytes by specific antigen or stimulation with mitogens such as phorbol esters and lectins ( 40 ) .
This activation works in concert with Tat in stimulating HIV-1 gene expression ( 34 , 40 ) .
In addition , the « B domain mediates activation of HIV-1 by the regulatory proteins of a number of heterologous viruses , including the ICPO protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 , the Ela protein of adenovirus , and the Tax protein of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( 41 , 64 ) .
The induction of HIV-1 replication caused by the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1 , specifically implicated in reactivation of HIV-1 from latency in astrocytes ( 61 ) , is also mediated by the « xB domain ( 43 , 45 ) .
The importance of the « kB domain to the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression globally , and , specifically , the involvement of the « kB domain in mediating transactivation by Tat in astrocytes , led us to study the status of xB transcription factors in astrocytes .
The results demonstrate the presence of kB-specific binding factors in human glial astrocytes that differ from prototypical NF- « B of lymphocytes .
Unlike prototypical NF-kB , the form of kB present in the CNS is specifically retained on an HIV-1 Tat affinity column , indicating either a direct or an indirect interaction between astrocyte-derived kB and Tat .
Astrocyte-derived « B-binding factors activate transcription of HIV-1 in vitro in a promoter-specific fashion that is dependent on the presence of « B-binding sites .
Moreover , TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription is reproduced in vitro and is found to be dependent on an astrocyte factor which correlates with xB-binding activity .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotides and in vitro transcription templates .
Templates for in vitro runoff transcription were prepared by restriction enzyme digestion of expression plasmids p117/80 , p117/3 , and 80/3 ( containing HIV-1 LTR nucleotides -117 to +80 , -117 to +3 , and -80 to +3 , respectively [ 60 ] ) with EcoRI or of pAdMLP ( containing a 430-bp Alul fragment of pAd6 [ 9 ] ) with BamHI .
Full-length runoff transcription from template ~117/+80 produces a transcript of 356 nucleotides .
Templates -117/+3 and -80/+3 produce transcripts of 279 nucleotides .
Template AdMLP produces a transcript of 375 nucleotides .
Oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in vitro transcription-competition analysis are as follows ( single strand shown only ) : 5'-TCGA CAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGC-3 ' ( wild-type « B site ) and 5-TCGACAGAGCTCACTTTCCGAGAGGC-3 ' ( mu-tant xB site ) .
Cells and tissue culture .
U-87MG cells are human astrocytic glioblastoma cells and were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle media ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) .
U-87MG cells , originally cloned by Ponten et al .
( 46 ) in 1966 , show characteristic markers of astrocytic differentiation and are available from the American Type Culture Collection .
The biology of HIV-1 in U-87MG cells has been studied extensively and is representative of behavior in a wide variety of astrocytes ( 6 , 14 , 15 , 46 , 58-60 ) .
Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal bovine serum .
For induced J. ViroL.. cultures , 50 ng of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma ) per ml was added to the growth media 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , or 20 h prior to harvesting the cells .
EMSA .
Nuclear extracts from U-87MG glial astrocytes and Jurkat T cells for use in EMSA and in vitro transcription were prepared as described previously ( 2 ) .
40,000 counts of *°P-end-labeled wild-type kB oligonucleotide was incubated with 8 ug of U-87MG nuclear extract in a binding buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM Na-EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 4 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) , 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) per ml , and 3 mM GTP .
Following a 30-min incubation on ice , the resulting complexes were resolved on a low-ionic-strength 6 % native polyacryl-amide gel containing 6.7 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 3.3 mM Na-acetate ( NaOAc ) , and 1 mM Na-EDTA .
Electrophoresis was carried out at 4°C at a constant 140 V with a recirculating buffer .
The gel was then dried and autoradiographed at -70°C with an instrument fitted with an intensifying screen .
For competition analysis , a 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction mixture .
Affinity column chromatography .
A 400-pg amount of purified protein ( Tat or BSA ) was dialyzed against coupling buffer containing 25 mM HEPES ( N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ) buffer ( pH 7.9 ) , 20 mM NaCl , 5 mM B-mercaptoethanol , and 10 % glycerol and then coupled to 200 pl of washed , equilibrated Affi-Gel 10 matrix ( Bio-Rad ) in a final volume of 2.5 ml overnight at 4°C .
A 400-pl volume of U-87MG or Jurkat T whole-cell extract ( 10 mg/ml ) , dialyzed against the column buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 50 mM KCI , 10 mM MgClI ; , 0.2 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 20 % glycerol [ 21 ] ) , was subjected to chromatography at 4°C at a flow rate of 1 ml/12.5 min .
The flowthrough was recycled four times , and the column was subsequently washed with 5 ml of column buffer .
Bound proteins were step eluted with KCI concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 M. Samples of the flowthrough , the first 400 pi of wash buffer , the final 400 pl of wash buffer , and each of the salt elution fractions were dialyzed against dialysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 6 mM MgC ] ; , 40 mM ( NH , ) , SO , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , and 15 % glycerol and analyzed for kB-binding activity by EMSA .
Samples of all fractions were examined by silver staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels , which demonstrated that all fractions retained full integrity ( no degradation detectable ) .
No gross differences were observed between Tat and BSA fractions by silver stain .
In vitro transcription analysis .
To analyze basal transcription , 50 to 100 ng of each template was incubated with 1.3 mM ATP , 1.3 mM GTP , 1.3 mM CTP , 20 pCi of [ « - '' '' P ] JUTP ( 400 Ci/mmol ) , and 7 pul of HeLa whole-cell extract in a reaction volume at 30°C for 1 h. HeLa whole-cell extract was prepared as described previously ( 35 ) .
The order of addition of the components of the transcription reaction mixture was consistently as follows : ( i ) template DNA [ and poly ( dI-dC ) when appropriate ] , ( ii ) nucleoside triphosphates , ( iii ) transcription extract , and ( iv ) [ « - '' '' P ] JUTP .
Transcription reactions were stopped by addition of 200 pl of stop solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 1 % SDS , 0.1 mM EDTA , and 50 mg of tRNA per ml and 200 pl of phenol .
This mixture was gently rocked for 5 min at room temperature , extracted three to five times with phenol-chloroform and once with chloroform , and ethanol precipitated with 0.3 M NaOAc on dry ice .
After centrifugation , the RNA was resuspended in gel loading buffer ( 90 % deionized formamide , 5 % Tris-borate-EDTA , and 0.5 % bromophenol blue ) and analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing acrylamide-urea gel .

To reveal the B1 and B2 NF- « B complexes , Jurkat T cells were stimulated for 20 h with PMA before nuclear extract preparation .
the reaction mixtures , containing suboptimum concentrations of the template DNAs ( 20 ng ) and 4 pl of HeLa whole-cell extract , were supplemented with 2 pl of the appropriate astrocytic nuclear extract .
Titration of the template indicated that 25 ng provided an optimal basal activity for analysis of transcriptional activation ( data not shown ) .
For the in vitro transcription competition experiments , the glial nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 pg of either wild-type or mutant « B oligonucleotide for 15 min on ice before being added to the transcription reaction mixture .
In addition , the in vitro transcription competition reaction mixtures contained only 15 ug of template DNA and were supplemented with 0.5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) .
For the in vitro transcription transactivation experiments , the transcription extracts were preincubated with 1 wM synthetic Tat protein for 15 min on ice .
Synthetic Tat protein ( amino acids 1 to 86 ) , a generous gift of S. A. Khan , Wistar Institute , Philadelphia , Pa. , was stored lyophilized at -70°C .
For use , Tat was dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mM HEPES-KOH ( pH 7.9 ) -20 % glycerol ( vol/ vol ) -100 mM KCI-O0.2 mM EDTA-1 mM DTT and degassed with N ; .
In quantitation , densitometry results were normalized for RNA recovery and gel loading by comparison with a reference band labeled R. This product is transcription independent and probably represents tRNA labeled with [ °°P ] UTP .
RESULTS Human astrocytes contain B-binding activity .
Observation that the HIV-1 « B domain mediated cell-specific Tat transactivation prompted an analysis of kB-binding factors from astrocytes ( U-87MG , an astrocytic glioblastoma cell line , is described in Materials and Methods ) .
EMSA using nuclear extracts prepared from U-87MG astrocytes reveals two complexes , designated a and B , which form with an oligonucleotide probe containing the HIV-1 « kB sequence ( GGGACTTTCC ) .
A biphasic pattern of induction in « B complex formation is observed upon treatment with the mitogen PMA .
In the absence of PMA treatment , both the a and B complexes are present at a low , basal level with a comparable ratio of « and B ( Fig .
1A , lane 1 ) .
Appearance of the « complex is substantially induced at 1 to 3 h after PMA stimulation , while the B complex is slightly induced , resulting in a dramatic increase in a complex relative to B complex ( Fig .
1A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
After 6 to 12 h of continuous stimulation by PMA , the « /B ratio returns to the levels observed in nontreated cells , although the quantity of both complexes remains elevated above basal levels ( Fig .
1A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
After 20 h of PMA stimulation , the B complex is greatly induced , while the a complex remains unaltered , resulting in a dramatic increase in the ratio of B complex relative to « , an inversion of the previous ratio ( Fig .
1A , lane 6 ) .
Both the a and B complexes were determined to represent a specific interaction with the kB sequence by competition analysis .
Formation of the a complex , induced upon stimulation of U-87MG cells with PMA for 3 h ( Fig .
1B , lane 2 ) , was blocked in the presence of 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide ( Fig .
1B , lane 3 ) but not in the presence of an oligonucleotide containing a mutant « B-binding site ( lane 4 ) .
Similarly , formation of the B complex , induced upon stimulation of U-87MG cells with PMA for 20 h ( Fig .
1B , lane 5 ) , was blocked by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled , wild-type oligonucleotide ( Fig .
1B , lane 6 ) but not by oligonucleotide containing a mutant kB-binding site ( lane 7 ) .
Astrocyte-derived B-binding factors differ from those observed in T lymphocytes .
The prototypical NF-kB induced by PMA in Jurkat T cells appears as two complexes that have been previously designated B1 and B2 ( 10 ) .
The a complex of U-87MG astrocytes comigrates with the B1 complex of Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
1C , lanes 1 and 3 ) and is induced with kinetics similar to those reported for B1 following stimulation with PMA ( 38 ) .

proteins of 75 , 86 , and 50 to 55 kDa , believed to represent p65 , c-Rel , and p50 , respectively ( 38 ) .
The B complex of U-87MG astrocytes migrates very slowly in the native gel , suggestive of a very large complex ( Fig .
1C , lane 1 ) .
A similarly large complex which migrates more slowly than NF-kB , coincidentally termed BETA , was previously observed in astrocytes and neurons ( 31 ) and has also been observed in mouse and human fetal brain nuclear extracts ( unpublished observation ) .
The induction kinetics of B complex suggest that de novo protein synthesis may precede the formation of this complex .
No complex of comparable migration is observed in Jurkat T cells , suggesting that astrocytes contain additional , or perhaps novel , « B-binding factors ( Fig .
1C , lane 1 ) .
The B2 complex of Jurkat T cells , which consists solely of 50- to 55-kDa proteins and probably represents a homodimer of p50 ( 38 ) , does not appear in astrocytic extracts , demonstrating further heterogeneity between kB-binding factors in U-87MG astrocytes and Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
1C , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In addition , astrocytic xB-binding factors differ from prototypical NF-kB in susceptibility to dissociation by oxidation , salts , and treatment with detergents ( unpublished data ) .
Astrocyte-derived xB is specifically retained on an HIV-1 Tat affinity column , while prototypical NF- « B is not .
To investigate the potential interaction between kB-binding factors and Tat , whole-cell extract prepared from PMA-stimulated U-87MG and Jurkat T cells was subjected to chromatography over an HIV-1 Tat affinity column .
The presence of both « and B complexes from U-87MG cells can be observed in the loaded extract , as well as in the flowthrough and the first washing fraction ( Fig .
2A , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
No kB-binding activity is observed in the last washing fraction , which contains very little protein as determined by silver staining ( unpublished observation ) .
Band shift analysis of salt elution fractions demonstrates that « B-binding activity , in the form of a B complex , retained on the Tat column is released in the presence of 0.3 to 0.5 M KCI ( Fig .
2A , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The a complex , in contrast , is not retained by the Tat column , suggesting a structural difference between these two astrocyte-derived « B-binding activities .
To examine binding specificity , U-87MG whole-cell extract was subjected to chromatography over a control affinity column containing BSA .
As can be seen in Fig .
2B , « B-binding activity is not retained on a BSA affinity column .
In a parallel experiment , whole-cell extract from PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells was subjected to chromatogra- Vor .

All of the prototypical NF-kB from these cells was found in the flowthrough and early wash steps , as was the « complex from U-87MG cells , suggesting that these factors are unable to bind to Tat and be retained on the Tat affinity column ( Fig .
2C ) .
Band shift analysis of the Jurkat extract on the control BSA showed no « kB-binding activity in the salt-eluted fractions ( data not shown ) .
The ability of the B complex derived from astrocytes to bind Tat further distinguishes this xB activity from prototypical NF-kB and promotes this activity as a candidate for mediating TAR-independent transactivation .
Transcriptional transactivation correlates with « B-binding activity .
To examine the influence of astrocytic nuclear factors on HIV-1 transcription , a cell-free in vitro transcription system was established by using HeLa whole-cell extract .
Templates for runoff transcription were generated by EcoRI digests of LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs ( Fig .
3A ) .
Template -117/+80 contains the HIV-1 LTR sequences from -117 to +80 relative to the transcription start site , which includes the « B domain ( - 105 to -80 ) , a GC-rich Sp1-binding domain ( -47 to -79 ) , a canonical TATA sequence , and 80 nucleotides of the HIV-1 leader sequence encoding TAR .

These transcripts are not produced in the presence of 0.5 pug of « -amanitin per ml , demonstrating their dependence on RNA polymerase II ( Fig .

To examine the influence of astrocytic nuclear factors on HIV-1 transcription in vitro , HeLa transcription extracts were supplemented with astrocyte-derived nuclear extracts .
In this and subsequent experiments , a lesser amount of template DNA was utilized to decrease basal transcription ( as described in Materials and Methods ) .
Supplementation of HeLa transcription extracts with nuclear extract from unstimulated U-87MG astrocytes had negligible influence on transcription from template -117/+80 ( Fig .

However , supplementation of HeLa transcription extract with nuclear extract from PMA-stimulated U-87MG glial astrocytes resulted in a transcriptional activation that strongly correlates with the induction of « B-binding activity ( Fig .

The greatest activation in transcription is seen upon addition of extract stimulated with PMA for 1 to 3 and 20 h ( approxi-mately eightfold + twofold activation in multiple experiments , as determined by densitometry ) .

-117/+3 is similarly activated by PMA-stimulated astrocytic nuclear extract , demonstrating that this response is independent of the TAR element ( Fig .
3C ) .
However , deletion of the « B-binding sites , utilizing template -80/+3 , abolishes the transcriptional enhancement , suggesting that factors mediate the activation ( Fig .
3C ) .
The presence of astrocytic nuclear factors has no influence on transcription directed by the adenovirus major late promoter , demonstrating that activation is not a general phenomenon ( Fig .
3C ) .
These results suggest that the astrocyte-derived xB activity present in both the a and B complexes contributes to activation of HIV-1 transcription .
Evidence that astrocyte-derived « B-binding factors are responsible for transcriptional activation .
To determine whether astrocytic activity is responsible for the transcriptional activation observed upon supplementation of the HeLa system with astrocytic nuclear factors , oligonucleotide competitors were used to interrupt interaction of < B-binding factors with the promoter .
The induction in transcription from tem- plate -117/+80 seen upon supplementation of the HeLa extract with stimulated astrocytic nuclear proteins ( Fig .
4A , lanes 1 and 2 ) is inhibited by the presence of an excess of oligonucleotide containing the wild-type « kB-binding sequence ( GGGACTITCC ) ( lane 3 ) but not by incubation with the mutant oligonucleotide ( CTCACTTTCC ) ( lane 4 ) .
Neither wild-type « B oligonucleotide nor mutant kB oligonucleotide influences the basal transcription from -117/+80 in HeLa extract alone ( unpublished results ) .
This result is consistent with the supposition that « B-binding proteins are responsible for the observed transcriptional activation .
As expected , the same « B-dependent induction in transcription is observed with template -117/+3 , which does not contain the TAR element , demonstrating that the effect is not TAR dependent ( Fig .
4B , lanes 1 to 4 ) .
Taken together , these results strongly suggest that the « B-binding activity present in the astrocytic nuclear extracts is responsible for the observed transcriptional activation .

astrocyte nuclear factors .
TAR-dependent activation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat can be observed in vitro with the HeLa whole-cell system , as has been previously reported ( 29 , 36 ) .
The addition of an optimal concentration ( 1 wM ) of synthetic Tat results in approximately a sevenfold + twofold increase in transcription from the -117/+80 template ( Fig .
5A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The ability of Tat to activate HIV-1 transcription in the HeLa system is dependent on TAR , as demonstrated by the inability of Tat to activate transcription from template -117/ +3 , which has the TAR element removed ( Fig .
5B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Our previous studies carried out in vivo indicated that astrocytes support TAR-independent activation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat ( 60 ) .
Supplementation of HeLa transcription extract with nuclear factors from unstimulated U-87MG astrocytes does not influence transactivation of template -117/+80 ( Fig .
5A , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
However , the presence of nuclear factors from unstimulated astrocytes contributes to an approximately 4.5-fold * 2-fold activation of transcription by Tat from template -117/+3 ( Fig .
5B , lanes 3 and 4 ) , demonstrating TAR-independent activation in vitro .
Interestingly , when this experiment was performed with PMA-stimulated astrocytic nuclear extracts , the addition of Tat resulted in a decrease in transcription , possibly representing a squelching phenome-non .
Similar decreases in transcription were observed with 3-and 20-h PMA-stimulated glial extract ( unpublished observation ) .
Supplementation of the HeLa system with nuclear extracts prepared from unstimulated Jurkat T lymphocytes does not permit Tat activation of the TAR-deleted -117/+3 template ( Fig .
6A ) , further suggesting that the ability to support TAR-independent Tat responsiveness is a feature unique to astrocytes .
It has been reported that nuclear extract from PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells activates HIV-1 transcription in vitro ( 33 ) .
It has also been reported that TAR-independent replication of HIV-1 is observed in PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells ( 6 , 26 ) .
Perhaps T-cell activation results in the expression of an 3978 TAYLOR ET AL .

68 , 1994 NF- « B-related activity that is common to , and enriched in , astrocytes .
Our current studies are examining the ability of PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells to support TAR-independent Tat activation in vitro and the relationship of this mechanism to that observed in astrocytes ( unpublished data ) .
TAR-independent activation of HIV-1 in vivo was found to be mediated by the kB domain of the viral LTR ( 6 , 60 ) .
As expected , the ability of astrocytic nuclear factors to support TAR-independent Tat responsiveness in vitro requires a functional xB-binding site .
Transcription from template -80/+3 , in which both TAR and the < B-binding sites have been deleted , is not activated by Tat , implicating the astrocytic « B-binding factors as mediators of Tat activity ( Fig .
6B ) .
Further evidence for the involvement of « kB-binding factors in mediating Tat transactivation comes from competition experiments .
Excess oligonucleotide competitors were used to interrupt interaction of « B-binding factors with the promoter .
Wild-type kB oligonucleotide , but not mutant oligonucleotide , inhibited Tat activation ( unpublished data ) .
DISCUSSION Differential utilization of transcription factors , determined by different subunit combinations or interactions with modu-latory activities , is a mechanism by which a cell can increase the functional diversity of a limited number of gene products .
Such diversity is observed in the activity and specificity of the NF- « B family of transcription factors .
In Jurkat T cells , the specific complex of p49-p65 works in concert with Tat to stimulate HIV-1 transcription , while a complex of p50-p65 may not ( 44 ) .
In U-87MG glial astrocytes , a newly recognized « B-binding activity is observed which is retained on a Tat affinity column and is capable of activating HIV-1 transcription .
In addition , the data suggest that the astrocyte-derived « B-binding activity is responsible for mediating TAR-independent transactivation by Tat .
Prototypical NF-KB consists of two protein subunits , 50 and 65 kDa , termed p50 and p65 , respectively .
The cloning of the genes encoding p50 and p65 allowed recognition that they were both related by homology in their amino-terminal region to the product of the rel oncogene .
In vivo , prototypical NF-kB consists of a heterodimeric complex of p50 and p65 which is sequestered in an inactive form in the cytoplasm by association of the p65 subunit with an inhibitory activity , IxB ( 3-5 ) .
NF- « B binding activity is rapidly induced by dissociation of IxB from the cytoplasmic complex , allowing nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 ( 3-5 ) .
Upon binding DNA , both p50 and p65 contribute to transcriptional activation ( 23 ) .
Activation of NF- « B , in most cell types , occurs independently of de novo protein synthesis and seems to involve phosphorylation of the inhibitor IxB ( 24 , 27 ) .
Recently , a gene related to , but distinct from , p50 was cloned ( 51 ) .
The product of this gene , p49 , is capable of forming a complex with p65 which activates HIV-1 transcription in Jurkat T cells ( 44 , 51 ) .
Evidence suggests that the heterodimeric complex p49-p65 , but not pS50-p65 , works in concert with Tat to stimulate HIV-1 transcription , demonstrating that functional differences result from different combinations of « kB-related proteins ( 44 ) .
The xkB-binding factors present in astrocytes show characteristics of prototypical NF- « B , such as specificity of binding , inducibility by PMA , and the bimodal kinetics of this induction .
However , electrophoretic mobility of the kB complexes derived from astrocytes differs from that of those seen in lymphocytes , demonstrating heterogeneity .
The a complex derived from U-87MG cells comigrates with the B1 complex of Jurkat T cells and is induced with similar kinetics ( Fig .
1 ) ( 38 ) .
CNS-DERIVED « kB REGULATION OF HIV-1 EXPRESSION 3979 Further , two-dimensional UV cross-linking experiments strongly suggest that astrocytic a and lymphocytic B1 complexes contain the same proteins in the same stoichiometry ( unpublished data ) .
Taken together , these observations suggest that the « complex is the U-87MG equivalent of the Jurkat B1 complex , both representing prototypical NF-kB .
Most interesting , however , is the presence of a more slowly migrating kB-binding complex B in U-87MG cells which has no readily observable counterpart in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
It is the astrocyte-derived B complex which is retained on the Tat affinity column , a feature not observed for either the astrocyte-derived a complex or the Jurkat-derived NF-KB ( Fig .
2 ) .
The B complex may be composed of novel , CNS-specific proteins of the Rel family of < B-binding factors .
Preliminary observations suggest , however , that the B complex represents a supershifting of prototypical NF- « B by a CNS-enriched activity that is capable of interacting with Tat .
The < B-binding activities of U-87MG cells are demonstrated to activate transcription in a promoter-specific manner that is dependent on the presence of kB-binding sites ( Fig .
3 and 4 ) , which classifies these binding activities as transcription factors .
It is likely that the ability of astrocyte-derived « B factors to interact with Tat is related to TAR-independent Tat transactivation which is mediated through the kB domain of the HIV-1 LTR ( 6 , 26 , 60 ) .
TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat is observed in vitro and , as expected , is dependent on the presence of both astrocytic nuclear factors and « B-binding sites within the promoter ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) .
The ability of Tat to potently activate the rate of HIV-1 transcription has been attributed to increased efficiency of transcriptional elongation , though increased transcriptional initiation in the presence of Tat has also been observed ( reviewed in reference 22 ) .
It has been proposed that Tat functions in the vicinity of the HIV-1 promoter to bias initiation towards the formation of more-processive transcription complexes .
This model is consistent with results implicating the participation of the kB domain and the Spl domain in Tat transactivation ( 7 , 30 , 55 ) , as well as kinetic studies which suggest that a transient interaction between Tat and nascent TAR RNA is sufficient for wild-type levels of transactivation ( 8 , 28 ) .
In other systems , distinct classes of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes , with differing efficiencies of elongation , have been observed and studied ( 37 ) , and evidence suggests that their formation may be determined by specific conditions of transcriptional initiation ( 56 ) .
While Tat is the first identified promoter-specific elongation factor , it would not be surprising to discover that this mechanism of transcriptional regulation is not unique to HIV-1 .
In addition to its role in regulating HIV-1 transcription , Tat appears to play other roles in the pathogenesis of AIDS .
This probably reflects the recently recognized ability of Tat to influence the expression of select cellular genes ( 11 , 50 , 58 ) .
Functional interaction between Tat and cellular transcription factors , such as those interacting with kB , may be involved in initiating the cascade of altered cellular gene expression that contributes directly to disease .
Consistent with this model , Tat has been directly implicated in the development of immunodeficiency ( 11 , 62 ) , as well as the development of Kaposi 's sarcoma ( 18 , 63 ) .
