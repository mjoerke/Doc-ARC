The human IL-4 gene , of 10 kilobases , is composed of four exons and three introns .
A cis-acting element ( P sequence ) resides in the 5 upstream region ; no additional DNA segments with enhancer activity were identified in the human IL-4 gene .
For further mapping purposes , a fusion promoter was constructed with the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor basic promoter containing 60 base pairs of sequence upstream from the cap site of the mouse granulocyte /macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene and various lengths of the 5 ' upstream sequence of the IL-4 gene .
The P sequence was located between positions -79 and -69 relative to the transcription start site of the human IL-4 gene , and this location was confirmed by base-substitution mutations .
The plasmids carrying multiple copies of the P sequence showed higher responsiveness to the stimulation .
The binding protein ( s ) that recognize the P sequence of the IL-4 gene were identified by DNA-mobility-shift assays .
The binding of NF ( P ) ( a DNA binding protein that specifically recognizes the P sequence ) to the P sequence was abolished when oligonucleotides carrying base substitutions were used , indicating that the NF ( P ) interaction is sequence-specific and that binding specificity of the protein paralleled the sequence requirements for IL-4 expression in vivo .
The P sequence does not share homology with the 5° upstream sequence of the IL-2 gene , even though surrounding sequences of the IL-4 gene share high homology with the IL-2 gene .
We conclude that a different set of proteins recognize IL-2 and IL-4 genes .
cDNA cloning ( 1 , 2 ) of interleukin ( IL ) 4 documented that many diverse activities were due to a single lymphokine .
In addition to B-cell growth factor activity ( 3 ) , IL-4 stimulates the proliferation of T cells and mast cells and acts as a potent costimulator of proliferation of immature T cells from fetal and adult thymuses .
Of particular importance is the profound effect of IL-4 on regulation of IgE production through the induction of isotype switching .
IL-4 strongly blocks activation of natural killer cells by IL-2 but enhances IL-2-induced proliferation of activated T cells .
These observations indicate that IL-4 is a powerful immune modulator ( for reviews , see refs .
4 and 5 ) .
The major source of IL-4 in mice is the T , ,2 subset of helper T ( T , ) cells ( for a review , see ref .
6 ) .
The production of IL-4 , like other lymphokines , is induced by antigen or mitogen stimulation .
Activation signals are transmitted through activation of protein kinase C and an increase of the intracellular Ca®* concentration .
The requirement for two signals , protein kinase C and calcium ions , in T-cell activation has been The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
2864 directly demonstrated by employing a mutant protein kinase C that is constitutively active in the absence of T-cell activation signals and by using the IL-2 gene as a model system ( 7 ) .
We have chosen IL-4 as a model for differential regulation of lymphokine genes .
For this purpose , we isolated mouse and human IL-4 genomic clones ( 8 , 9 ) .
IL-4 is a single-copy gene composed of four exons and three introns in mouse and human that are ~6 and 10 kilobases , respectively .
The 5 ' flanking regions of human and mouse IL-4 genes share ~85 % homology , suggesting their importance for the regulation of IL-4 expression ( 8 ) .
IL-4 genes for mice and humans were mapped on chromosomes 11 and 5 , respectively , and are part of a cluster of lymphokine genes , such as IL-3 , granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , and IL-5 ( 10 , 11 ) .
In this report , we demonstrate that a cis-acting sequence ( P sequence ) is responsible for receiving signals through the interaction of NF ( P ) protein , a DNA binding protein that specifically recognizes the P sequence .
The P sequence is apparently unique to the IL-4 enhancer and is not found in the IL-2 enhancer although surrounding sequences share high homology .
We propose different sets of proteins regulate the expression of IL-4 and IL-2 genes .
A preliminary account of this work has been presented ( 12 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Construction .
The construction of pmGMLuc-60 , pmGMLuc-96 , and pcDSRa-PX has been described ( 13 , 14 ) .
Deletion mutants with various lengths of the 5 ' upstream region of the human IL-4 gene were constructed by using mung bean nuclease , yielding series of phIL-4 plasmids .
Fusion promoter construction was carried out by transferring various lengths of fragments from phIL-4 plasmids into pmGMLuc-60 after filling-in the Bg/ II site , yielding of pFIL-4 ( 439 ) , phIL-4 ( 297 ) , phIL-4 ( 220 ) , phIL-4 ( 176 ) , and phIL-4 ( 63 ) .
The pFIL-4 ( 199 ) plasmid was constructed by inserting a Dra I fragment ( positions -199 to -32 ) into the blunt-ended Bagi II site of pmGMLuc-60 .
The numbers in parentheses represent the position of 5 ' end of the human IL-4 gene .
The region between positions -176 and -64 was divided into three portions ( fragment A , positions -176 to -140 ; fragment B , positions -139 to -101 ; fragment C , positions -100 to -64 ) .
These synthetic fragments , designed to create Abbreviations : IL , interleukin ; GM-CSF , granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; T , , helper T. *Present address : Department of Biochemistry , School of Dentistry , Showa University , 1-5-8 Hatanodai , Shinagawa-ku , Tokyo , 148 , Japan .

Bgl II cohesive ends ( GATC ) at the 5 end , were inserted into the unique Bg/ II site of the pmGMLuc-60 plasmid .
The plasmids were named pFIL-4 ( A ) , pFIL-4 ( B ) , and pFIL-4 ( C ) .
pFIL4 ( -C ) contains fragment C in the antisense orientation ; pFIL-4 ( A +B ) and pFIL-4 ( B +C ) have DNA fragments spanning positions -176 to -101 or positions -139 to -64 , respectively .
The N ( GATCCTGGTGTAACGAAAATTTC-CAATGT , positions -88 to -64 ) , the P ( GATCCG-AAAATTTCC , positions -79 to -69 ) , 2P ( GATCCGAAA-ATTTCCGATCCGAAAATTTCC ) , 3P ( GATCCG- AAAATTTCCGATCCGAAAATTTCCGATCCGAAA-ATTITCC ) , 3P , ; ( GATCCTAAAATITCCGATC- CTAAAATTTCCGATCCTAAAATTTCC ) , and 3P ; , ( GATCCGAAAATTTACGATCCGAAAATTTACGATC-CGAAAATTTAC ) oligonucleotides were inserted into Bg/ II site of pmGMLuc-60 to obtain pFIL4 ( N ) , pFIL4 ( P ) , pFIL-4 ( 2P ) , pFIL-4 ( 3P ) , and 14 ) .
Cell Culture , Transfection , and Luciferase Assay .
Trans-fections into Jurkat cells were performed as described ( 14 ) .
Transfection experiments were repeated at least three times .
Luciferase assay was performed as described ( 9 ) .
Preparation of Nuclear Extract from Jurkat Cells .
Cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) at 50 ng/ml plus 0.5 uM A23187 ( PMA/A23187 ) for 2-8 hr for large-scale preparation or for luciferase assay before harvest , respectively .
Nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells were prepared as described ( 15 ) .
DNA-Mobility-Shift Assay .
The mobility-shift assay was as described ( 15 ) .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated on 5 % native polyacrylamide gel at 4°C in 89 mM Tris borate , pH 7.5/2 mM EDTA .
RESULTS Regulatory Sequence ( s ) Responsible for Mediating PMA/A23187 Stimulation Signals are Localized in the 5 Upstream Region .
As we reported ( 9 ) , human IL-4 gene expression in Jurkat cells , the T-cell leukemia line , was induced upon stimulation by PMA/A23187 , which mimics antigen stimulation .
DNA elements essential for induction of the human IL-4 gene by virus trans-activators and for PMA/ A23187 stimulation are localized in the 5 ' upstream region .
To delineate the regulatory region of the human IL-4 gene , 5 ' upstream fragments were linked to the GM-CSF heterol-ogous promoter , which contains a 60-base-pair ( bp ) sequence upstream from the transcription initiation site of the GM-CSF gene .
After transfection of these constructs , the IL-4 promoter activity was evaluated by measuring firefly luciferase activity .
The appearance of luciferase activity was dependent upon PMA/A23187 stimulation and the upstream sequences ( Table 1 ) .
The cis-acting element responsible for induction was mapped between positions -176 and -63 .
This observation was also confirmed in B21 ( 16 ) , the cloned T-cell line , with nonfusion promoter constructs ( data not shown ) .
An 11-bp Sequence ( P Sequence ) Confers Responsiveness to PMA Stimulation .
To identify the minimum region that responds to stimulation , the DNA segment covering positions -176 to -64 was divided into three fragments , A , B , and C ( Table 2 ) , which were placed upstream of the GM-CSF basic promoter either in combinations of two or as single fragments .
Enhancer activity was located in fragment C ( positions -100 to -64 ) since high luciferase activity was observed when plasmids carrying this fragment were transfected into Jurkat cells ( Table 2 ) .
The stimulation activity of fragment C was orientation-independent .
The induction activity was restored also when fragment C was replaced by fragments N and P , which cover positions -88 to -64 and positions -79 to -69 , respectively .
The importance of the P sequence for the expression of the IL-4 gene was shown clearly by using plasmids that carry multiple copies of the P Proc .

The transcription activity was augmented 3- and S-fold when pFIL-4 ( 2P ) and pFIL-4 ( 3P ) , having two and three copies of the P sequence , respectively , were transfected into Jurkat cells ( see Fig .
2 ) .
The pFIL-4 ( 3P ) showed comparable activity to pmGMLuc-96 , which has a relatively strong promoter and enhancer system ( 17 ) .
For further con-firmation , base substitutions were introduced within the P sequence ( Fig .
1 ) and the resulting plasmids were transfected into Jurkat cells .
As expected , mutant plasmids with substitution mutations in the P sequence could not respond to stimulation .
The one exception was pF ( 84+85 ) , which has substitutions at the 5 ' end of the P sequence ( positions -79 to -77 ) .
Cells with pF ( 72+73 ) , in which base substitutions were outside the P sequence , were responsive to stimulation .
pFIL-4 ( 3P ; 4 ) carrying three copies of the P sequence with a substitution mutation at the second base from 3 ' end of the P sequence ( at position -70 ) could not respond to the stimulation ( Fig .
2 ) .
On the other hand , plasmid pFIL-4 ( 3P ; ) with three copies of the P sequence carrying a substitution mutation at the second base from 5 ' end of the P sequence ( at position -78 ) showed perfect response to stimulation , indicating agreement with the results shown in Fig .

DNA Binding Protein ( s ) that Recognizes the P Sequence of the Human IL-4 Enhancer .
DNA binding protein ( s ) that specifically recognize the P sequence and mediate signals were characterized by DNA-mobility-shift assays ( Fig .
3 ) .
When fragment C was used as a probe , three distinct shifted bands ( bands I , II , and III ) were observed .
Since their binding was inhibited by addition of fragment C as a competitor , bands I and II were considered to be specific DNA-protein complexes .
In contrast , band III is a nonspecific complex due to the failure of fragment C to inhibit complex formation .
Band II appears to be a specific DNA-protein complex whose recognition sequence resides Table 2 .

NF ( P ) complex formation , with the same specificity , was observed when extracts from unstimulated cells were used instead of the extracts from stimulated Jurkat cells .
To examine the relation between specific DNA binding protein ( s ) and expression in vivo , competition experiments employing the same set of mutant oligonucleotides used for transfection experiments shown in Fig .

complex NF ( P ) was inhibited by addition of 50-fold excess of double-stranded oligonucleotides 72+73 and 84+85 ( Fig .

An excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides 70+71 , 80+81 , and 82 +83 could not prevent the formation of P-labeled NF ( P ) complex .
These results are consistent with in vivo transfection experiments ( Fig .
1 ) , indicating that recognition of the P sequence by NF ( P ) is essential for IL-4 gene expression .
The P Sequence Conserved in Mouse and Human IL-4 Is Apparently Unique to the IL-4 Enhancer .
The P sequence that was mapped as a cis-acting sequence of the human IL-4 enhancer shares high homology with the mouse IL-4 gene ( Fig .
5 ) .
The human IL-4 enhancer contains two extra bases ( positions -77 and -78 , CG ) at the 5 ' end of the P sequence that were shown to be dispensable for both binding and transcription activity in vivo ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
In addition , the mouse IL-4 enhancer has an extra base at position -71 ( T ) .
NF ( P ) -P-sequence ( human ) complex formation was inhibited by addition of the mouse P sequence ( data not shown ) , indicating that the P sequence from both human and mouse are recognized by human NF ( P ) protein .
As was indicated ( 18 ) , reasonable homology was recognized in the 5 ' flanking region of the genes for IL-2 and IL-4 .
The P sequence , however , was apparently unique to the IL-4 enhancer , although surrounding sequences showed high homology with the human IL-2 enhancer ( positions -66 and -95 ) ( Fig .
5 ) .
Interestingly , the recognition sequence for NFIL2A ( a DNA binding protein ) is also found in the IL-4 Competitors ( 20 ng ) Fig .

Involvement of a Different Set of Proteins in the Regulation of IL-4 and IL-2 Gene Expression .
Since the expression of IL-2 and IL-4 is generally mutually exclusive in the mouse system , we determined whether different sets of binding proteins recognize the IL-2 and IL-4 sequences .
Competition experiments using a site A fragment [ hIL2 ( W ) ] as a probe and site A fragments with various lengths of insertion sequences as competitors were carried out .
The formation of hIL2 ( W ) -NFIL2ZA complex was not inhibited by addition of an excess of hIL-4 ( W ) ( Fig .
6 Left ) .
When mutant oligonucleotides carrying insertions of partial P sequences in site A [ hIL2.4 ( A ) , ( B ) , and ( C ) ] were used as competitors , competition was much less efficient than it was when hIL-2 ( W ) was used , indicating that the interaction of NFIL2A protein with site A was abolished by interruption of site A sequence either with the P sequence or a nonrelated sequence .
Binding of NF ( P ) to the P sequence was not inhibited by hIL2 ( W ) or by hIL2.4 ( C ) ( Fig .
6 Right ) .
NFP ) binding , however , was inhibited not only by hIL4 ( W ) but also by hIL2.4 ( A ) and hIL2.4 ( B ) , despite the presence of insertions within the site A sequence .
This insert recreated 8 bp ( AATTTCCA ) of the P sequence .
Thus these results indicate that the P sequence is unique to IL-4 and is recognized by NFP ) but not by NFIL2A protein , in spite of the conservation of the NFIL2A recognition sequence in the IL-4 enhancer .
DISCUSSION We have studied the mechanism of IL-4 induction after T-cell activation as a model system for coordinated and differential regulation of lymphokine genes .
We have shown that a cis-acting DNA element that responds to the signal resides in the 5 upstream region of the human IL-4 gene ; although , the response to signaling is much weaker than for other lymphokine genes such as GM-CSF and IL-2 ( data not shown ) .
It is a reasonable assumption that enhancer sequence ( s ) may be located not only in the 5 ' upstream sequence but also in the intron sequences or even outside the IL-4 gene , since genes for IL-3 , GM-CSF , IL-4 , and IL-5 are clustered within several hundred kilobases on chromosomes 5 and 11 for human and mouse , respectively ( 11 ) .
During the course of DNA sequencing studies of the human IL-4 gene ( 9 ) , potential enhancer sequences such as a TG repeat sequence in the second intron ( positions 2966 and 3077 ) , which are known to form left-handed Z-DNA under certain conditions , and three 70-bp tandem repeats in intron 3 ( positions 7694 and 7902 ) were found .
We , however , did not find any enhancer activity , when intron fragments were inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid phIL-4 ( 176 ) ( data not shown ) .
We have identified an essential cis-acting sequence in the T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat between positions -176 and -63 by using 5 ' deletion constructs .
The observation was quence with T ; l and T » ,2 lymphokine genes .

hIL-2 JGG @ T _ hIFN-y also confirmed in a human T-cell clone , B21 ( 16 ) ( data not shown ) .
We mapped a P sequence ( CGAAAATTTCC ; between positions -79 and -69 from the cap site of the human IL-4 gene ) as a cis-acting sequence .
An experiment using substitution mutations in the P sequence confirmed that this sequence is essential for the PMA/A23187-stimulated response ( Fig .
1 ) .
The evidence that transcription activity was augmented by placing multiple copies of the P sequence upstream of the GM-CSF basic promoter ( Fig .
2 ) also supports this proposal .
The P sequence is apparently unique to the IL-4 gene and was conserved between human and mouse genes ( Fig .
4 ) .
We have identified a DNA binding protein ( s ) , NF ( P ) , that recognizes the P sequence specifically ( Fig .
2 ) .
A competition experiment showed that NF ( P ) can recognize human and mouse P sequences ( data not shown ) .
The formation of NF ( P ) -DNA complex , however , was not PMA/ A23187-stimulation-dependent ( data not shown ) .
There are several possible explanations for this observation .

interaction is stimulation-dependent but whose affinity to NFP ) is not strong enough to allow isolation as a complex by a mobility-shift assay .
Alternatively , the NF ( P ) is modified in a stimulation-dependent manner but the modification does not affect the mobility-shift band .
Interestingly , the region surrounding the P sequence ( positions -91 to -53 ) of human IL-4 showed high homology ( 88 % ) with the site A sequence of the human IL-2 gene ( positions -91 to -66 ) ( Fig .
5 ) .
NFIL2A , which recognizes site A in the IL-2 enhancer ( 19 ) , is indistinguishable from the ubiquitous octamer binding protein Oct-1 ( 20 ) .
Two octamer motifs , ATGCAAAG ( positions -302 to -295 ) and ATGTAAA ( C ) T [ positions -67 to -60 ( -59 ) ] , are recognized in the human IL-4 enhancer .
The former octamer motif , however , is found only in human IL-4 .
The latter octamer motif seems not to be recognized by Oct-1 protein in spite of good conservation of the octamer motif , since the addition of the hIL-4 ( W ) fragment ( positions -92 to -53 ) did not inhibit NFIL2A ( Oct-1 ) -site A complex formation ( Fig .
6 ) .
This observation indicated that , in IL-4 , insertion of a P sequence upstream of the octamer motif abolishes the interaction between NFIL2A ( Oct-1 ) and DNA , suggesting that the octamer consensus motif alone may not be enough for NFIL2A ( Oct-1 ) protein recognition .
Thus this may be a device by which Oct-1 protein , a ubiquitous protein , can interact with the IL-2 enhancer but not with the IL-4 enhancer .
Unlike IL-2 , the IL-4 enhancer requires only a short stretch of the DNA motif ( P sequence ) to confer responsiveness to PMA/A23187 stimulation .
For activation of the IL-2 gene , at least four and possibly five motifs within the IL-2 enhancer ( positions -326 to -63 ) seem to be involved ( 20 , 21 ) .
Among several DNA binding proteins that bind to critical sites for IL-2 expression , such as NF-AT , NFIL2A , NF-kB , and AP-1 ( 21-23 ) , NF-AT , which binds at the E site ( extend-ing from positions -255 to -285 of the human IL-2 gene ) , is thought to provide activation dependency and T-cell specificity ( 22 ) .
For IL-4 , it remains to be determined whether the P sequence alone is enough to confer T-cell specificity and activation dependency .
We have found that the IL-4 gene is induced by p40'* and by PMA/A23187 ( data not shown ) .
Both share the same cis-acting sequence , the P sequence .
Several groups have claimed that p40'** acts through transcription factor NF- « B ( 24 ) .
Furthermore , the involvement of NF- « B or related proteins in the expression of several cytokines , such as IL-2 , GM-CSF , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor , and the IL-2 receptor is proposed ( 25-29 ) .
From that evidence , NF ( P ) is likely to be NF- « B or a NF- « B-related protein , but a definitive answer is not yet available .
Since , unlike NF-KB , binding of the NF ( P ) is not stimulation-dependent , although an excess amount of « B oligonucleotide abolished the complex of NF ( P ) with P-sequence probe ( unpublished result ) .
Many human T-cell clones are found to simultaneously secrete IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , and interferon y upon stimulation .
However , the human counterparts of the mouse T , ,1 and T , ,2 subsets , with similar cytokine production profiles , have been identified among T-cell clones isolated in certain disease situations ( 30 ) .
The human T,1-like subset produced IL-2 and interferon y but low or absent levels of IL-4 and IL-5 , whereas the T , ,2-like subset had the opposite pattern , indicating that under particular conditions human T cells can be primed in vivo to subsets with a restricted cytokine production profile .
The results in this paper suggest that DNA binding proteins interact with the IL-2 and IL-4 genes in a mutually exclusive way , therefore raising the possibility that the structure of these genes may be implicated in the differential regulation of the T,1- and T , ,2-like cytokines .
This is substantiated by the DNA sequence comparison shown in Fig .
5 .
It remains , however , to be determined whether the differential regulation of these genes is due to differences in coupling of the T-cell receptor to intracellular signaling Proc .
