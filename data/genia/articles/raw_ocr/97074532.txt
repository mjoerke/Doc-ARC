Interferon Augments PML and PML/RARa Expression in Normal Myeloid and Acute Promyelocytic Cells and Cooperates With All-trans Retinoic Acid to Induce Maturation of a Retinoid-Resistant Promyelocytic Cell Line By Kathryn Nason-Burchenal , Domenica Gandini , Marina Botto , Janet Allopenna , James R.C .
Seale , Nicholas C.P .
Cross , John M. Goldman , Ethan Dmitrovsky , and Pier Paolo Pandolfi The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor a gene ( RARa ) in the acute promyelocytic leukemia { ( APL ) 15 ; 17 translocation .
PML is expressed in diverse tissues and cell lines and localized in the nucleus with a typical speckled pattern .
In the bone marrow , it is preferentially expressed in myeloid cells .
PML appears to be transcriptionally regulated by class | and iI interferons , which raises the possibility that interferons modulate the function and growth and differentiation potential of normal myeloid cells and precursors by activating PML-dependent pathways .
Similarly , interferons could act on APL cells , alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) , especially if the PML/RAR « fusion transcript that results from the t ( 15 ; 17 ) is induced by inter CUTE PROMYELOCYTIC leukemia ( APL ) , the M3 subtype in the French- American-British ( FAB ) classi-fication , represents greater than 10 % of all the myelogenous leukemias in adults .
APL is characterized by the expansion , in bone marrow , of abnormal promyelocytes .
'~ APL patients often respond to chemotherapy , while the majority of patients also achieve transient complete remission following all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) treatment . '' ''
RA , both in vivo and in vitro , induces terminal differentiation of APL cells toward mature granulocytes . ''
Unlike with other myeloid leukemias , APL cells are extremely sensitive to the matura-tion-inducing action of RA .
This exquisite sensitivity is para-doxical , since the molecular hallmark of the disease is a reciprocal translocation that involves the retinoic acid receptor a ( RARa ) gene on chromosome 17 .
RARa is translo-cated to a gene located on chromosome 15 , initially designated myl , and subsequently renamed PML . ''

We report here that PML is expressed at low levels or not expressed in normal circulating human monocytes , lymphocytes , and polymorphonucleate cells , but is markedly induced by interferon ; that PML and PML/RARa expression is augmented by interferon in the NB4 APL cell line , which carries the t ( 15 ; 17 } , and in APL blasts from patients ; that interferon inhibits growth and survival of NB4 APL cells in cooperation with RA ; that interferons alone have minimal maturation effect on NB4 cells ; and , finally , that interferon y , but not a or , induces maturation and growth suppression of NB4 cells with de novo retinoid resistance , and partially restores RA response .

transcripts can be expressed : PML/RARa and RARa/ PML .
'*'° PML/RARa is expressed in all t ( 15 ; 17 ) -containing APL cases and , in the leukemic blasts , coexists with a truncated form of PML , referred to as aberrant PML .
RARa/ PML is expressed in only 70 % of cases . '' ''
The PML/RARa protein retains most of the putative functional domains of the PML protein and the DNA and ligand-binding domain of RARa .
PML/RARa can heterodimerize with RXR and PML/RARa has the potential to interfere with both PML and RARa endogenous signaling pathways and , in vitro , blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines and promotes cell growth by inhibiting apo-ptotic cell death . '' ''
RARa is a transcription factor and member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily , implicated in regulating aspects of development and differentiation . ''
PML is a nuclear protein whose normal function is at present under active study . '' ''
Recently , we found that PML expression is specifically transcriptionally regulated by class I and II interferon treatment of diverse cell lines . '' ''
This finding prompted us to investigate the following : ( 1 ) if this regulation was occurring in normal circulating myeloid cells ; ( 2 ) if the level of expression of PML and PML/RARa proteins was affected by interferon in NB4 cells , the sole APL cell line carrying the t ( 15 ; 17 ) , or in APL blasts from patients ; ( 3 ) if interferon influences the capacity of NB4 cells to grow and survive before or after RA treatment ; ( 4 ) if interferon induces terminal differentiation of APL cells ; and ( 5 ) if interferons could restore RA response in RA-resistant NB4 cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell purification and cell culture conditions of human neutrophils , lymphocytes , and monocytes .
- Peripheral blood from normal human volunteers was obtained by venipuncture .
Neutrophils were isolated under sterile conditions by two consecutive Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugations as described previously . ''
Each experiment was performed on cells derived from a single donor .
Cell preparations were routinely assessed for viability ( > 95 % ) by trypan blue exclusion and for contaminating cell types by Wright staining and nonspecific esterase cytochemistry ( a-naphthyl acetate esterase staining ) , which showed that greater than 99 % of purified cells were polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) .

IFN AND RA-RESISTANCE IN APL from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) by adherence to polystyrene tissue culture flasks for 1 hour at 37°C as described previously . ''
PMN ( 10'/mL ) and monocytes ( 6 to 8 x 10°/mL . )
were cultured for up to 24 hours in RPMI 1640 medium ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) , supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , and antibiotics .
All media , sup-plements , and buffers were prepared using endotoxin-free water .
The cells were cultured in the presence of Escherichia coli lipopolysac-charide ( LPS ; 1 mg/mL ) ( Sigma Chemical , St Louis , MO ; serotype 026.B6 ) ; interferon y ( 20 ng/mL , 100 U/mL ) ( Hoffman-LaRoche , Nutley , NJ ) or tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ; 5 ng/mL , 800 U/ mL ) ( Bissendorf Biochemicals , Hannover , Germany ) .
Cell culture of APL blasts .
APL patients ' mononuclear cells were suspended at 10¢/mL in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco , Paisley , UK ) , 15 % FCS ( Seromed , Berlin , Germany ) , and cultured at 37°C in humidified air with 5 % CO ; , for 24 hours .
Recombinant human « -interferon 2a ( Hoffman-LaRoche , Nutley , NJ ) and y-interferon ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) were both used at levels similar to those achieved by pharmacologic doses of 100 U/mL .
RNA isolation and Northern analysis .
| Total cellular RNA was extracted from cell preparations by the guanidinium-isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method , '' '' electrophoresed on 1 % agarose gels , blotted onto a nylon membrane ( Nytran ; Shleicher & Schuell , Keene , NH ) , and incubated with different cDNA probes labeled with [ P ] by the random primer method . '' ''
Hybridizations were performed with the PML cDNA probe LAV1O and the RARa cDNA probe IT , as previously described .
`` `` > '' A cDNA probe for P-actin , a gene constitu-tively expressed and not modulated by cytokine treatment , was used as control for the amounts of RNA loaded onto the gels .
RNA was quantified by optical density and by scanning densitometry as previously described . ''
Immunofluorescence microscopy .
- Peripheral blood from normal human volunteers was obtained by venipuncture .
PMNs were isolated under sterile conditions by two consecutive Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugations as described previously . ''
Each experiment was performed on cells derived from a single donor .
Cell preparations were routinely assessed for contaminating cell types by Wright staining , which showed that the population of purified cells were PMN .
Monocytes were isolated from PBMC by adherence to polystyrene tissue culture flasks for 1 hour at 37°C as described previously and lymphocytes were collected as well .
PMN , lymphocytes , and monocytes were cultured for 24 and 48 hours in RPMI 1640 medium ( GIBCO ) , supplemented with 30 % heat-inactivated FCS , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , and antibiotics , in the presence or absence of interferon y ( 100 U/mL ) .
The PMN and lymphocytes were then collected and subjected to cytospin ( 10° cells/slide ) .
All cells were fixed at room temperature with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes , and methanol at -20°C for 7 minutes .
Cells were subsequently incubated with 10 % goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) blocking solution for 1 hour and then for 1 hour with monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) PG-M3 '' ® ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , an MoAb raised specifically against a peptide sequence located within the aminoterminal region of the human PML protein .
The dilution of the antibody was 1:150 .
Bound MoAb was detected using a rabbit antimouse antibody conjugated with fluores-cein isothiocyanate ( FITC ; Sigma ) .
A DAPI ( 4',6-diamine-2-phenyl-indole-dihydrochloride ) nuclear staining ( Boehringer Mannheim , In-dianapolis , IN ) was also performed .
Specimens were then analyzed using an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope ( Olympus America , Lake Success , NY ) .
Protein isolation , Western analysis , and antibodies .
A total of 10 ' cells was pelleted , resuspended in 1 mL of chilled RIPA lysis buffer ( 150 mmol/L NaCl + 50 mmol/L Tris pH 8.0 + 1 % NP-40 + 0.5 % deoxycholate + 0.5 ug aprotinin , leupeptin , pepstatin , antitrypsin , chymostatin + 1 mmol/L phenylmethyisulfonyl fluoride 3927 [ PMSF ] ) , and left on ice for 30 minutes .
The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 minutes and the supernatant was stored on ice .
Protein concentration was assessed with the Bradford assay , and 50 ug protein per lane was run on a 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) polyacrylamide gel for 3.5 hours at 100V .
The protein was electrotransferred from the gel to supported nitrocellulose ( Amersham International , Little Chalfont , UK ) .
The ECL Western blotting protocol and kit ( Amersham International ) was used for antibody labeling and detection .
Blots were exposed to film for 5 to 10 seconds for the RARa antibody and 1 to 5 seconds for the PML antibody .
The films were scanned with a BioRad Model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) .
Relative intensities were analyzed with National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Image 1.57 ( by Wayne Rasband , NIH , Bethesda , MD ) and Molecular Analyst ( BioRad ) software .
The PML antibody , PML PG-M3 was used at a 1:250 dilution , and this recognizes some of the many isoforms of PML expressed .
The RARa antibody , kindly provided by Dr Pierre Cham-bon , recognizes both the wild-type RARa and the PML/RARa fusion proteins , and was used at a 1:4,000 dilution .
Blots were stained with Ponceau- $ ( Sigma ) to assess for equal protein loading .

RESULTS PML and PML/RARa expression is regulated by interferon in normal circulating monocytic , lymphocytic , and polymorphonuclear cells ; in APL blasts ; and in the NB4 APL cell line .
- The level of expression of the PML gene in normal circulating neutrophils and monocytes was analyzed by Northern analysis performed on total RNA isolated from cells from healthy human donors ( see Methods ) .
PMNs and monocytes were also treated , before RNA extraction , with E coli LPS , TNF , or interferon y ( see the Materials and Methods ) .
PML expression was difficult to detect in untreated PMNs and monocytes even after long exposures ( up to 2 weeks of autoradiography ; Fig 1A ) .
While interferon y markedly augmented PML expression , especially in PMNs , neither TNF nor LPS had observed effects on PML expression ( Fig 1A ) .
Despite a higher level of expression in APL cells and myeloid precursors , PML was expressed at low levels in mature circulating myeloid cells and was specifically regulated by interferon .
LPS , which activates circulating leukocytes , does not regulate PML .
It is notable that the Northern analysis expression pattern following interferon y treatment of PMNs is different from that found for PML in other tissues .
The lower of the three major bands usually recognized by the cDNA probe used ( LAV 10 , see Methods ) is barely detected , while the three bands are detected in the monocyte samples treated with interferon y ( Fig 1A ) .
This finding indicates differences in PML isoform expression in NASON-BURCHENAL ET AL normal circulating neutrophils with reduced or absent expression of PML isoform 3 .
`` ° PML protein expression was also studied by immunofluorescence analysis in polymorphonucleate ( PMN ) , lymphocytic ( LP ) , and monocytic ( MON ) blood cells ( Fig 1B ) .
Cells were stained with the MoAb PG-M3 , as described earlier .
PML protein was undetectable before interferon y treatment in all three populations .
The simultaneous staining with DAPI confirmed the presence of cells and displayed the nuclear structure .
Treatment with interferon y induced a typical speckle-like staining in the nucleus of PMN cells .
Both a speckle-like and a diffuse nuclear staining were present in lymphocytic cells after interferon y treatment .
Monocytes displayed a speckled nuclear distribution , with some cells having a cytoplasmic staining ( Fig 1B ) .
These data confirm the low basal level of PML expression in mature circulating PMNs , lymphocytes , and monocytes and show that PML expression is markedly increased by interferon y treatment .
PML and PML/RARa expression was also monitored by RT-quantitative PCR in blasts derived from APL patients upon exposure to interferon ( Table 1 ) . ''
In both cases , PML/ RARa mRNA was augmented by interferon in parallel with PML transcripts , suggesting the portion of PML fused to RARa retains the element ( s ) that mediate interferon induc-ibility .
The differentiation at 24 hours , as estimated by NBT and Mo-1 analyses , was negligible ( data not shown ) .
The fact that PML and PML/RARa was regulated by interferon in mature circulating myeloid cells prompted us to confirm these data with Western analysis .
For this pur-pose , NB4-S1 and NB4-R 1 cells were exposed for 36 hours to 100 U/mL and 1,000 U/mL of interferons a , 8 , and y. PML , RARa , and PML/RARa protein expression was monitored by Western analysis ( Fig 2 and the Materials and Methods ) .
In NB4-S1 cells ( Fig 2A ) , PML/RARa , and PML protein levels were upregulated after interferon treatment .
The upper band in the top panel represents PML/RARa , as seen with the RARa antibody , and , excepting the 100 U/mL interferon a treatment group , there is a twofold increase in expression , as assessed by densitometric scanning .
Hybridiza-tion with the PML antibody shows a twofold to threefold increase in the total amount of PML protein .
Likewise , 100 U/mL interferon a treatment shows no increase in PML protein levels .
In NB4-R 1 cells ( Fig 2B ) , the level of expression of PML/RARa is increased twofold in all treatment groups .
Notably , although the total amount of PML protein did not change in these cells , there is differential regulation of the PML isoforms .
A similar pattern of bands is also seen in U937 cells ( data not shown ) , while HL-60 cells present Fig 1 .
( A ) PML mRNA expression in activated human monocytes and polymorphonuciear cells ( PMN ) } before and after stimulation with LPS , TNF , interferon ( IFN } y , or without treatment ( ¢ ) .
A total of 7 mg of total cellular RNA was loaded in each lane .
The bands that characterize the 4 major PML isoforms are present in the IFNy- treated monocytes lane ( black arrowhead indicates the 2.1-kb transcript ) , whereas the trancript encoding for PML isoform 3 is not visible in IFN+y-stimulated PMN lanes as indicated by the empty arrowhead .
The quantity of loaded mRNA was normalized on the basis of the G-actin mRNA signal .
( B ) Immunofiuorescence analysis of polymorphonucleates ( PMN ) , lymphocytes { LP } , and monocytes ( MON ) stained with MoAb PML-PG3 shows the absence of the protein before IFNy treatment .
Treatment with IFNy leads to the appearance of a typical speckle-like staining in the nucleus of PMN ceils .
A speckle and a diffuse nuclear staining is also present in LPs .
A speckled nuclear distribution is visible in monocytes , but in some cells cytoplasmic staining is detected .
The nuclear cellular staining with DAPI of each field is also shown .

Enhancement of the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of interferon and RA on NB4 cells .
The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of class I and II interferons ( interferons a .
B , and y ) on NB4 cells were compared , in the presence or absence of 10° mol/L RA ( Fig 3 and the Materials and Methods ) .
Three different concentrations of the three interferons were used : 10 , 100 , and 1,000 U/mL .
The antiproliferative effect of RA alone or at concentrations ranging from 10 ~ to 10 ~* mol/L was independently assessed .
RA was cytotoxic at 10 ~* mol/L .
RA alone exerted an antiproliferative effect at a concentration 10 ~ '' mol/L , with maximal inhibition at mol/L ( 80 % ) , which became evident on the second day of culture ( data not shown ) .
NB4 cells ' doubling time , in the absence of RA or at 10~ ' mol/L , was approximately 44 hours ( data not shown ) .
At concentrations of 10 U/mL , these interferons did not exert any observed antiproliferative effects either alone or in combination with RA ( data not shown ) .
At doses achievable in vivo ( 100 U/mL ) , these interferons inhibited cell growth in a similar manner , with maximal inhibition of 30 % to 40 % reached at day 4 ( Fig 3A ) .
If cells were treated with a combination of interferon and RA , an enhanced antiproliferative effect was obtained ( Fig 3A ) .
Even more marked proliferative inhibition occurred when the cells were treated with a higher dose of interferon ( 1,000 U/mL ) ( data not shown ) .

Reduction of MTT to blue formazan was measured spectrophotomatrically , and the Y-axis represents the optical density .
ons ( Fig 3B ) , and at all the concentrations used ( 10~'° to 10~ '' mol/L ) , RA exerted minimal effects on NB4 cell viability ( Fig 3B and data not shown ) .
Cytotoxicity was observed when NB4 celis were treated simultaneously with interferon and RA ; interferon # was more cytotoxic than a or y ( Fig 3 ) .
These interferons markedly inhibited growth , and this effect was enhanced by RA treatment in NB4 cells ( Fig 3 ) .
Differentiating effects of RA and interferon y on NB4 cells .
- In NB4 cells , the differentiation-inducing effects of interferon a , 3 , and y , in the absence and presence of RA ( 10~° mol/L ) , was assessed using an immunophenotypic marker and the NBT assay .
As previously reported , NB4 cells , when treated with RA , mature along the myeloid path-way , characterized by expression of the myelomonocytic marker Mo-1 .
** ' When treated with 10~° mol/L RA , expres- sion of the immunophenotypic marker , Mo-1 , increased substantially in NB4-~S1 cells ( ~83 % ; Fig 4 ) .
In contrast to this pattern , NB4-R1 cells have a minimal shift in expression ( ~7 % increase ) .
When treated with 100 U/mL .
interferon y alone , NB4-R1 cells responded to a slightly higher degree than NB4-S1 cells ( ~22 % and ~16 % shift , respectively ) .
With the combination of 100 U/mL interferon y plus RA , there was a substantial increase in the expression of Mo-1 in the NB4-R 1 cells ( ~32 % from baseline ) .
This result indicates an additive effect of the two compounds .
This combined treatment did not have any greater maturation effect on NB4-S1 cells than did RA alone .
In fact , the 69 % increase from baseline is less than was induced with RA alone .
The response to 1,000 U/mL interferon y , with or without RA , was also analyzed , and these results were similar , but with From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

The level of Mo-1 expression in NB4-R1 and NB4-S1 cells grown in the presence of 100 U/ mL and 1,000 U/mL interferon a and 3 , with and without RA ( data not shown ) , was studied .
None of these treatment conditions , in either cell , showed a response to interferon or an enhanced response to RA .
The NBT assay was also used to assess maturation of NB4-R1 and NB4-S1 cells before and after the same treatment combinations .
These data independently confirmed that interferon y induced NB4-R1 cells to differentiate , and , in combination with RA , there was at least an additive matura- NASON-BURCHENAL ET AL tion effect .
Figure 5 depicts the percentage of NB4-R1 and NB4-S1 cells that reduce NBT after treatment with 100 U/ mL interferon y in the presence or absence of RA .
Data in Fig 5A show that after 5 days of treatment , NB4-S1 cells were responsive to RA ( 69 % NBT-positive ) , but had no response to interferon y alone ( 1.5 % NBT-positive ) .
There was not an enhanced effect with the combined treatment ( 73 % NBT-positive ) .
At day 5 , there was almost maximal differentiation achieved in NB4-S1 cells treated with RA alone .
To establish whether interferon y augmented RA actions but was masked by the already high response rate of NB4-S1 cells , the NBT assay was performed on day 3 .
These results showed that NB4-S1 cells treated with RA alone and RA plus 100 U/mL interferon y still exhibited similar differentiation ( 19 % and 20 % NBT-positive , respectively ) ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , NB4-R1 cells were responsive to 100 U/mL interferon y ( 14 % NBT-positive ) ; and had a negligible RA response ( 3.8 % NBT-positive ) .
A superadditive effect with the combination of RA plus interferon y ( 28 % NBT-positive ) was observed .
A greater response occurred when NB4-R1 cells were treated with 1,000 U/mL interferon y alone ( 22 % NBT-positive ) and with RA plus 1,000 U/mL interferon y ( 40 % NBT-positive ) ( data not shown ) .
Interferon a , 3 , and y , did not exert an appreciable effect on the RA response of RA-sensitive cells , except in the treatment arm of 1,000 U/mL interferon a plus RA , when NBT-positive cells increased slightly ( data not shown ) .
Due to the ability of interferon y to differentiate NB4-R 1 cells , the effect of interferon y on proliferation of NB4-R I and NB4-S1 cells was assessed by MTT assay . ''
The MTT assay was used in studies of NB4-R1 and NB4-S1 cells to facilitate analysis of multiple treatment combinations .
This assay is more rapid than manual cell counts determined by hemocytometer .
Figure 3C shows that 100 U/mL interferon y alone had a slight inhibitory effect on proliferation of NB4-R1 cells .
The combination of 100 U/mL interferon y plus RA led to a substantial decrease in proliferation by day 5 .
These results were even more notable in the combination of 1,000 U/mL interferon y plus RA ( data not shown ) .
Con-versely , interferon y alone had no effect on the NB4-S1 cells .
The combination of RA plus either 100 U/mL or 1,000 U/mL interferon y was similar to RA treatment alone ( Fig 3A ) .
In summary , interferon y overcomes de novo resistance to the growth inhibitory and differentiation properties of RA in NB4-R1 cells .
At the dose of 100 U/mL interferon y , a level achievable in patients , myeloid maturation occurred in NB4-R1 cells , and when combined with RA , effects were at least additive .
At the higher interferon levels , 1,000 U/ mL , this response was enhanced .
Interferon a or 3 treatments did not induce growth arrest or differentiation of NB4-R I1 cells .

`` `` > ' Different PML isoforms are expressed within tissues and cell lines from different histologic origin .
In the bone marrow , PML expression is restricted to the myeloid compartment .
`` ° Activated macrophages accumulate PML protein in the nuclear bodies . '' ''
Class I and II interferons transcriptionally induce PML in several cell lines . '' ''
This study examined whether interferon regulates PML expression in normal circulating myeloid cells .
Notably , PML is not appreciably expressed in mature circulating myeloid cells .
This finding , combined with the observation that PML is highly expressed in bone marrow cells of myeloid lineage and in APL promyelocytes , suggests PML expression declines when neutrophils and monocytes mature .
`` ** '' These cells reactivate PML expression after stimulation with specific cytokines .
A cytokine active in this effect is interferon that is able to induce PML expression within a few hours of treatment ( Fig 1 ) .
Regulated PML expression by interferon occurs in terminally differentiated myeloid cells in a cell-type-spe-cific manner .
In PMNs , PML-3 isoform is not augmented by interferon to levels comparable to other isoforms , whereas in monocytes all PML isoforms are induced ( Fig 1A ) .
Immunofluorescence studies showed that after interferon stimulation , PML not only localizes to the nuclear speckles of circulating monocytes , but also accumulates in the cytoplasm of these cells ( Fig 1B ) .
In contrast , interferon-stimulated PMNs have PML distributed in a typical nuclear speckled pattern .
Upon interferon stimulation , PML is upregulated in circulating lymphocytes , where it accumulates in the nuclear bodies and throughout the nucleus ( Fig 1B ) .
If PML functions in negatively regulating cell growth , then PML may be necessary during terminal maturation ; however , once a mature circulating blood cell no longer proliferates , PML could acquire a different role , one that is dependent on interferon stimulation , such as functional activation during viral or bacterial infections .
Interferon also induces PML and PML/RARa expression in NB4 APL cells and in some APL cells from patients ( Fig 2 and Table 1 ) .
This finding suggests the interferon regulatory elements within PML are not lost when PML fuses to RARa , and raises the possibility that interferon plays an important role in controlling proliferation and differentiation of APL blasts by regulating PML or PML/RARa expression .
Based on this assumption , we treated NB4 cells with class I and II interferons .
Because APL blasts mature in response to RA treatment , interferon effects in these cells were examined alone and in combination with RA .
Cell viability was not appreciably affected by treatment with interferon and RA alone ( Fig 3 and data not shown ) .
In contrast , interferon and RA exert a synergistic cytotoxic effect when administered together , with interferon 3 being more effective than either a or y ( Fig 3 ) .
RA treatment exerts an antiproliferative effect , with a maximal response at a concentration of 10° mol/L ( 80 % ) ( data not shown ) .
At clinically achievable doses , interferon also suppresses growth of APL cells .
The three interferons examined inhibit cell growth in a similar manner , with a maximal inhibition of 30 % to 40 % ( Fig 3 ) .
When NB4 cells are treated with interferon ( 100 U/mL ) plus RA ( 10° mol/ L ) , greater growth suppression occurs ( Fig 3 ) .
The interferons studied in the presence and absence of RA show , in NB4 cells , at least an additive antiproliferative effect .
Interferon alone has negligible differentiation-inducing capacity on NB4-S1 cells , which retain the ability to differentiate upon exposure to RA ( Figs 4 and 5 ) .
Surpris-ingly , when interferon y alone was tested at pharmacologic doses on NB4 cells , which are refractory to the maturative effects of RA ( NB4-R1 ) , 15 % to 20 % of the cells differentiated as established by the NBT assay and flow-cytometric analysis of myeloid surface markers ( Figs 4 and 5 ) .
Interferon a and 3 treatments alone did not exert appreciable maturation responses in either NB4-S1 or NB4-R1 cells .

3934 Interferon y partially restored RA response of NB4-R 1 cells , as seen by the more than additive effect of the combination treatment .
The capacity of interferon to promote growth inhibition , cytotoxicity , and differentiation of myeloid cells has been investigated primarily with cell lines such as HL60 and U937 that do not carry the t ( 15 ; 17 ) specific to APL .
**** The findings of this study extend prior work exploring the role of interferon in APL cells '' '' '' '' by reporting a comprehensive analysis of interferon effects in normal hematopoietic cells , fresh APL cells from patients , and RA-sensitive and -resis-tant NB4 cells .
Taken together , these data are consistent with the view that interferons play a role in normal and pathological myeloid hematopoiesis by augmenting signals that regulate commitment , maturation , and expansion of myeloid precursors , thereby modulating the expression of different genes , including PML .
Interferon acts in a specific manner in APL , where it upregulates PML/RARa and PML and partially restores differentiation sensitivity in an RA-resistant NB4 APL cell .
Grignani et al have shown that PML/RARa blocks differentiation of U937 myeloid cells , but , in the presence of pharmacologic doses of RA , promotes differentiation of these cells . '' '' '' '
Based on these results , they proposed a model by which the PML/RARa fusion protein is leukemogenic in the absence of RA , but promotes terminal differentiation of APL promyelocytic blasts if RA is present . '' ''
If this model is correct , then one way to explain the results reported here is to postulate that PML/RARa expression is augmented by interferon and with pharmacologic RA doses promotes the differentiation of APL blasts .
Notably , a PML/RARa protein of expected size is found by Western analysis of the NB4-Rl RA-resistant line we have used in these studies ( data not shown ) .
Alternatively , interferon may promote differentiation by modulating the expression of PML isoforms .
Yet , neither of these interpretations fully accounts for the preferential effects of interferon y , which , if compared with a and B , appears most effective in promoting differentiation of NB4-resistant cells .
In one clinical APL case , the use of interferon successfully overcame RA resistance in vivo . '' '
In another case , interferon did not overcome retinoid resistance , '' but the interferons used in these studies differed and neither study used interferon y .
From the studies reported here , it is apparent that additional in vitro studies are needed to pursue the mechanisms responsible for this cooperation before additional clinical trials are undertaken .
It would be worthwhile to learn whether interferons can induce growth suppression or maturation of other RA-resistant NB4 lines , especially NB4-resistant cells where the PML/RARa chimeric protein is not found . ''
This study has highlighted a potential role for interferon y in the treatment of retinoid resistant APL .
Yet interferons a and # may also play a role in other APL cases .
It would be interesting to examine whether interferons are clinically active alone or in combination with RA in APL patients characterized by variant translocations such as the t ( 11 ; 17 ) associated with a de novo resistance to RA . ''
It remains to be explored if treating APL patients , at pre- NASON-BURCHENAL ET AL sentation , with a retinoid plus interferon regimen could increase the proportion of cells undergoing terminal differenti-ation , and thereby enhance chemotherapeutic response .
Transgenic mouse models of APL carrying t ( 15 ; 17 ) , as well as t ( 11 ; 17 ) products , would be extremely useful in addressing these questions .
