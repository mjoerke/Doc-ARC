Keywords : Myc ; Mad ; oncogene ; cell cycle ; lympho-cyte ; tumor suppressor Introduction Madl is one of a family of three known bHLHLZip proteins ( Ayer et al. , 1993 ) .
Madl homodimerizes poorly but interacts with Max to form a sequence-specific DNA-binding heterodimer .
The bHLHLZip domain of Madl is required for both heterodimeriza-tion with Max and its sequence-specific DNA binding ( Blackwell et a/. , 1990 ) .
The Mad1/Max complex binds to the same E box motif as Myc/Max heterodimers but , in contrast to Myc/Max , Mad1/Max complexes function as transcriptional repressors ( Amati et al. , 1992 ) through interaction with the co-repressors mSin3A/mSin3B and the mammalian histone acetylases HDAC and HDAC2 .
Madl association with mSin3A/ mSin3B/HDAC requires the N-terminal 25 residues of Madl .

This suggests that Madl represses transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases to target sites on DNA ( for review : Kiermaier et a/. , 1997 ) .
In addition to Madl , the Mad protein family also comprises Mxi ( Zervos et al. , 1993 ) , Mad3 and Mad4 ( Hurlin et al. , 1995 ) , all of which specifically associate with Max to repress transcription .
Mad proteins , like Myc proteins , are short-lived ( Ayer et al. , 1993 ) and their expression is tightly regulated during cell cycle progression and in response to induced differentiation in various cell lines ( Ayer et al. , 1993 ; Zervos et al. , 1993 ; Hurlin et al. , 1995 ; Larsson et al. , 1994 ) .
In contrast , expression of Max protein is constitutive .
However , because both Myc and Madl compete for Max ( Ayer et al. , 1993 ) , access of Myc to Max is profoundly dependent upon expression of Madl ( and vice versa ) .
For this reason , Madl1/Max complexes function as repressors of Myc activity as evidenced by the fact that Madl1/Max ( and Mxi/Max ) inhibit Myc transactivation of reporter plasmid constructs containing the Myc consensus element ( Ayer et a/. , 1993 ; Zervos et al. , 1993 ; Backwood et al. , 1992 ) and that Madl suppresses Myc transforming activity in rat embryo fibroblasts ( Lahoz et al. , 1994 ) .
However , it is not clear whether the biological activity of Mad proteins resides solely in their abilities to antagonize Myc proteins or whether , as dominant trans-repres-sors , they fulfill other roles .
Therefore , to gain further insight into the biological action of Madl in vivo , we have generated transgenic mice in which the expression of a Madl transgene is targeted to the thymus , a tissue in which both c-Mye and Madl are normally expressed ( Broussard-Dichl et al. , 1996 ; Foley et al. , 1998 ) .
Indeed , in situ hybridization analysis indicates that different members of the Mad gene family are expressed in distinct , yet partially overlapping patterns in adult thymus ( Queva et a/. , 1998 ) .
Since proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis play such crucial roles during T cell development , the thymus offers itself as a particularly intriguing experimental system in which to examine the consequences of manipulating the Myc/Max/Madl1 network in vivo .
To date , transgenic mouse analysis of the Myc/Max/ Madl network has been restricted to ectopic expression of c-mye within the lymphoid compartment ( CD2-c- mye , Thyl-comyc , Epu-c-myc ) ( Stewart et al. , 1993 ; Spanopoulou et al. , 1989 ; Adams et al. , 1985 ) .
However , in all such cases deregulated c-myc expression results in the formation of tumors , making it difficult to analyse normal lymphocyte differentiation in these mice .
C-mye knockout mice have also been generated but these die between day E9.5 and E10.5 of gestation ( Davis et al. , 1993 ) , before the onset of lymphocyte ontogeny .
In contrast , the consequences of ectopic Mad1 expression has not yet been investigated and although Mad1-~- have been generated and are viable , no data are available concerning Tcell development in these mice .
In this paper , we investigate the effects of expression of a Madl transgene under the control of the proximal /ck promoter on thymocyte development .
We show that although thymus size in /ck-Mad !
transgenic mice is drastically reduced , general representation of individual thymocyte sub populations seems overtly normal .
We investigated the effects of Madl expression on positive thymocyte selection using MHC class TI-restricted H-Y-TCR transgenic mice .
This analysis shows that Madl expression reduces the efficiency of positive selection .
We also show that thymocytes and splenic T cells from [ Ick-Mad ! l transgenic mice display a profound proliferative defect when activated with PMA/Ionomycin or anti-CD3/ CD28 antibody in vitro .
Only the first thymocyte G0 S transition is inhibited by Madl expression and this inhibition can be , at least in part , overcome by co-expression of c-Myc .
Results Generation of \ck-Madl1 transgenic mice To examine the action of Madl in vivo , we generated transgenic mice in which a Madl transgene was expressed under the control of the T cell lineage specific proximal ick promoter which directs expression of the transgene to thymocytes and mature peripheral T lymphocytes ( Wildin et al. , 1991 ) .
A schematic representation of the transgenic construct is depicted in Figure la .
Construct DNA was injected into C57BL/ 6x CBA F1 embryos using standard techniques ( Brin-ster et al. , 1985 ) .
Two founder lines were generated , both harbouring roughly the same copy number ( ~10 copies , data not shown ) .
Both lines behaved identically and are therefore not further distinguished .
Expression of the Mad1 transgene was monitored by Northern blot analysis using total RNA and a human Madl cDNA as a probe .
Expression of the transgene was detected in transgenic thymus and spleen tissue .
No expression was detected in thymus and spleen from control littermates ( Figure 1b ) .
As a control transgene expression was not detected in heart tissue of transgenic mice .
RT-PCR analysis performed on RNA derived from sorted thymocyte sub populations such as double negative ( DN ) , double positive ( DP ) or CD4* and Analysis of Mad1 function in T cells using Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice B Rudolph et al a CD8* single positive thymocytes ( CD8 * SP , CD4+* SP ) from Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice showed equal expression of the transgene in all thymocyte sub populations ( Figure 1c ) .
Expression of endogenous Madl was detected in the DN , DP and to a weaker extent in the CD4* SP sub population ( Figure 1c ) .
In addition , RT-PCR analysis on sorted thymocyte sub populations from wild-type and Mad1 transgenic mice showed comparable expression of other Mad family members such as Mxi and Mad4 in different thymocyte sub populations ( Figure 1c ) .
We confirmed immunokhistochemically protein expression of the transgenic Madl protein in thymus using a Madl specific antibody .
Staining for the endogenous Madl protein was detected with weak intensity .
Specificity of the staining was confirmed by preincubation of the Madl specific antibody with its immunogenic peptide which blocked all signal ( Figure 1d ) .
Lck-Mad1 transgenic mice exhibit reduced numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T cells but thymocyte sub populations are represented normally Mad1 expression had a dramatic effect on thymic cellularity : thymus size , as well as the total thymocyte number , was reduced by approximately 50 % relative to wild-type control littermates ( Figure 2a right panel ) .
To examine the effects of Madl expression on T cell development , thymocytes from /ck-Madl transgenic mice and from control littermates ( 4-10 weeks old ) were analysed by three-color flow cytometry using antibodies against CD25 , CD44 , CD3s , CD69 and in combination with CD4 and CD8 to discriminate between the different thymocyte sub populations .
These analyses indicated that Madl expression caused no significant change to the ratios of the four thymocyte sub populations in the adult ( Figure 2a ) .
In addition , a more detailed analysis of the four DN sub populations did not reveal a difference between control littermates and /ck-Mad !
transgenic mice ( data not shown ) indicating no developmental blockade in early T cell development in /ck-Mad ! l transgenic mice .
The level of all cell surface markers tested was unchanged .
To examine any effect that Madl expression might have on peripheral T lymphocytes , lymph node cells were analysed by two-color flow cytometry using antibodies against CD4 and CD8 to discriminate between the different T cell sub populations .
These analyses showed a reduction in the percentage of the CD4* and CD8*+ SP population which was accompanied by a reduced number of mature T cells in the peripheral lymph nodes when compared with control littermates ( Figure 2b ) .
Expression of the Ick-Madl1 transgene in an H-Y-TCR background perturbs thymic selection One way that Madl might reduce thymic cellularity is to disrupt positive and/or negative selection .

Radiolabelled RT-PCR reactions were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to detect the expression of Mad1 , Mxi and Mad4 in different thymocyte sub populations of wildtype control littermates ( wt mice ) and /ck-Mad1 transgenic mice ( Mad1 tg mice ) .
Independent RT-PCR amplification of /-actin mRNA was used as a control for efficient cDNA synthesis .

transgenic mice ( Mad1 ) .
Frozen sections were stained for Madl protein expression in the absence ( left panel ) or presence of immunogenic peptide ( right panel ) examine this possibility , we crossed /ck-Madl transgenic mice with mice expressing a transgenic T cell receptor specific for the male H-Y-antigen presented by MHC class I H-2D® .
In male mice , the well-established model system for negative selection , almost all thymocytes are negatively selected during Tcell development through the interaction of the transgenic H-Y-TCR with the male specific H-Y peptide .
In female mice , where no male H-Y-antigen is present , selection of MHC class TI-restricted CD8* SP thymocytes proceeds very efficiently because thymocytes expressing the H-Y-specific transgenic TCR are positively selected ( Teh et al. , 1989 ; von Boehmer , 1990 ) .
First , in female H-Y-TCR transgenic mice , flow cytometry using antibodies against CD4 and CD8 and the transgenic H-Y-TCR ( T3.70 ) indicated that Madl expression had a significant effect on positive selection .
Compared with female H-Y-TCR transgenic mice , female H-Y-TCR transgenic mice carrying the Mad !
transgene exhibited an increased proportion of DN Oncogene thymocytes and a concomitant reduction in the percentage of DP , CD8* SP and CD4* SP thymocytes ( Figure 3a ) .
This change in the thymocyte subset distribution was also obvious in the absolute cell number .
( Figure 3a table ) .
Gating on the CD8* SP population showed that all CD8* SP cells expressed high levels of the transgenic H-Y-TCR indicating that these cells had been selected by interaction of the TCR « /B with H-2D° MHC molecules ( Figure 3b ) .
Consistent with the reduced percentage of DP * , CD8* SP and CD4* SP thymocytes , a reduction in the mature CD8* and CD4* population in the periphery was observed ( Figure 3¢ ) .
Similar to transgenic mice , female /ck-Mad !
x H-Y-TCR double transgenic mice showed a decrease in thymic cellularity ( table Figure 3a ) .
Thus , thymic cellularity and thymocyte subset distribution analysis both demonstrate that Madl reduces the efficiency of positive selection in T cells expressing a class MHC-restricted TCR « / $ B .

A comparison of thymuses from male /ck-Mad1 x H-Y-TCR double transgenic mice with control H-Y-TCR transgenic mice showed no significant difference in thymic cellularity : both were extremely hypocellular .
Examination of negative selection using flow cytometry revealed differences between H-Y-TCR transgenic and /ck-Mad1 x H-Y-TCR double transgenic mice .
Antibodies against CD4 and CD8 showed that expression of Madl caused an increase in the proportion of DN thymocytes accompanied by a reduction in the proportions of DP+ , CD4* and CD8+ SP thymocytes .
Staining of lymph node cells with the same antibodies however showed only a minor reduction in the representation of mature CD8 * cells in the periphery ( data not shown ) .
To summarize , we did not observe a significant difference in total thymocyte number between male /ck-Madl x H-Y-TCR double transgenic and male H-Y-TCR mice .
In addition , the effect on the percentage of CD8* cells in the periphery was extremely mild .
Thus , the only thing we do conclude from these data is that Mad1 expression does not seem to reduce negative selection .
Impaired mitogen-induced proliferation in lck-Madl1 transgenic mice In the absence of activation , T cells are arrested in GO .
Mitogenic stimulation of the TCR triggers progression into S phase and consequently proliferation .
C-myc is well characterized as a gene that is rapidly induced in T cells following mitogenic stimulation ( Carding and Reem , 1987 ) .
Moreover , c-mye appears to be necessary for thymocyte proliferation since antisense oligonucleo-tide inhibition of c-Myc expression blocks S phase entry of T cells ( Heikkila et al. , 1987 ) .
For this reason , and because of the dramatic effect of Madl expression on the total thymocyte cell number in vivo , we next investigated the effect of Madl expression on mitogen-induced proliferation .
Thymocytes and purified T cells from /ck-Madl transgenic mice or control littermates were stimulated with either antiCD3/CD28 antibody or phorbol myr-istate acetate ( PMA ) and Ionomycin , and proliferation assayed by [ PH ] -thymidine incorporation .
Madl expression significantly suppressed proliferation of both thymocytes and purified splenic T cells in response to either mitogenic stimulus ( Figure 4a and data not shown ) .
The effect was not due to changes in the level of TCR , CD3s expression or CD28 expression on the cell surface , which was unaffected by Mad1 expression ( data not shown ) .
This suppression was not reversed by addition of exogenous recombinant interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) indicating that the impaired proliferation is not a consequence of impaired autocrine IL-2 stimulation ( Figure 4a and data not shown ) .
p53 is implicated in suppression of cell proliferation in response to a number of stimuli , such as DNA Oncogene damage , oncogene deregulation ( for review Schwartz and Rotter , 1998 ) and inhibition of CD95/Fas signalling ( Zoernig et al. , 1998 ) .
Therefore , we were interested to determine whether Madl1-induced growth arrest is dependent upon expression of p53 .
Leck-Mad1 transgenic mice were crossed with p53w_- mice ( Donehower et al. , 1992 ) .
Thymocytes from p53 and p53~- non-transgenic and Ick-Madl transgenic mice were then assayed for their proliferative response to anti-CD3/CD28 mitogenic stimulation .
Absence of p53 had no effect on the ability of Madl to suppress T lymphocyte proliferation ( Figure 4b ) .
Mad1-suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation is not accompanied by alterations in described G1 phase cell cycle regulators Although the Myc/Max/Mad1 network is implicated in the control of cell proliferation ( Eilers et al. , 1991 ; Evan et al. , 1992 ; Keath et al. , 1984 ; Heikkila et al. , 1987 ; Roussel et al. , 1996 ) , its precise relationship with the cell cycle machinery remains largely obscure .
Progression through the cell cycle is controlled by different active cyclin/edk complexes whose activities are regulated by the availability of regulatory cyclin subunits , the presence of major cdk-inhibitory proteins and by the phosphorylation status of the cyclin/edk complexes ( Albrecht et al. , 1998 and ref .
therein ) .
We therefore investigated whether Madl expression has any effect on expression or activation of these regulators .
In response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation , expression levels of the constitutively expressed cyclin-dependent kinases cdk2 and cdk4 remain unchanged .
In contrast , cyclin E and cyclin D2 are up regulated .
Cdk inhibitor p27 is present in quiescent thymocytes but rapidly degraded following mitogen stimulation ( Boonen et al. , 1999 ) whereas the Cdk inhibitor p21 is undetectable in quiescent T cells but induced by antiCD3/CD28 activation ( Linette et al. , 1996 ) .
As shown in Figure 5a , despite the profound growth-inhibitory effect of Madl on thymocytes , the expression patterns of all of these G1 phase cell cycle regulators was unaffected ( Figure Sa ) .
Likewise , the immediate early kinetics and extent of expression of c-myc was unaffected by growth-inhibitory levels of Madl ( not shown ) .
In contrast , expression of cyclin A , an indicator of cell proliferation and S phase entry , was markedly suppressed in /ck-Mad !
transgenic thymocytes in response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation .
Expression of cyclin A in unstimulated cells was comparable in wild-type and transgenic thymocytes ( Figure 5a ) .
In fibroblasts it has been demonstrated that an increased level of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity precedes entry into S phase induced by c-Myc activation ( Steiner et al. , 1995 ) and that this is necessary for induction of cyclin A by Myc ( Rudolph et al. , 1996 ) .
We were curious to see if Madl expression in thymocytes would block the induction of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity in response to Analysis of Mad1 function in T cells using Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice B Rudolph et al a A .

transgenic mice is p53-independent .
( « ) Thymocytes from control littermates ( wt ) and /ck-Mad1 transgenic mice ( Mad1 ) were plated in the presence or absence of IL-2 and treated with either antiCD3/CD28 antibody ( CD3/CD28 ) or PMA/Ionomycin ( PMA/Iono ) as indicated .
Mean incorporation of was assessed from triplicate wells at different time points after treatment .
Shown is a representative experiment .
( b ) Thymocytes from hetero- and homozygous p53 mutant mice , either with or without the transgene , were plated on anti-CD3/CD28 coated plates ( CD3/CD28 ) .
Incorporation of [ °H ] -thymidine was assessed from triplicate wells at different time points after treatment .
Shown is a representative experiment anti-CD3/CD28 treatment .
Thymocytes from Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice and control littermates were stimulated for 48 h with antiCD3/CD28 , extracts were prepared from stimulated and unstimulated cells and immune complex kinase assays performed using an anti-cyclin E antibody or control antibody with histone H1 as a substrate ( Figure 5b ) .
As expected no cyclin E-dependent kinase activity was detectable in non-stimulated thymocytes .
However , following co-stimulation with antiCD3/CD28 , we observed clear increases in cyclin E kinase activity in both wild-type and /ck-Madl transgenic mice .
Thus , although thymocytes exhibit reduced cyclin A levels in response to anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation , this was not accompanied by any detectable suppression of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity .
Expression of Madl in T cells blocks only the first GO-S entry into the cell cycle but not subsequent cell cycles Initial entry of quiescent T cells from G0 into the cell cycle appears to be a mechanistically discrete process from the M-G1 transition of continuously proliferating cells .
Unlike exit from M phase , exit from G0 is accompanied by transient expression of immediate early genes and the GO-S transition takes far longer than the equivalent transition from M to S phase .
It is still unclear whether the Myc/Max/Madl1 network is primarily concerned with the GO-G1 transition or whether it fulfils a reoccurring or sustained role in continuously proliferating cells .
For this reason , we decided to investigate whether the growth-inhibitory effect of Madl was exerted only at the exit from quiescence or also in each reoccurring cell cycle .
To monitor proliferation over time in response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation purified T cells from Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice or control littermates were labelled in vitro for 72 h using the fluorescent dye CFSE ( Wells et al. , 1997 ) .
This dye binds irreversibly to the cell surface and segregates equally between daughter cells upon cell division .
As cells divide their fluorescence halves sequentially with each generation .
When analysed by flow cytometry , gating on the living cells showed that unstimulated splenic T cells from either Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice or control littermates exhibited a sharp single peak indicative of no cell 1169 Oncogene Analysis of Mad1 function in T cells using Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice B Rudolph et al 1170 A .

( a ) Thymocytes from control littermates ( wt ) and /ck-Mad1 transgenic mice ( Mad1 ) were either harvested immediately ( NS ) or plated in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 antibody for 48 h ( CD3/CD28 ) .
Expression of important G1 phase cell cycle regulators in response to anti-CD3/CD28 activation was then analysed by Western immunoblot analysis .
Where indicated with an asterisk , cells were incubated for 72 h with antiCD3/CD28 antibody .
( b ) Extracts of thymocytes from control littermates ( wt ) and transgenic mice ( Mad1 ) , either before ( NS ) or after treatment with immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 ( CD3/CD28 ) for 48 h. Cyclin E-dependent kinase activity in wild-type and in Mad ] transgenic thymocytes was assessed by immune complex kinase assay using either an anti-cyclin E serum ( cye E ) or a control antibody ( co ) with histone H1 as a substrate division ( Figure 6a , left panel ) .
In contrast , activation of T cells from control littermates resulted in the appearance of several distinct peaks representing successive cell divisions .
We observed marked heterogeneity and asynchrony in the kinetics of cell division , with some cells having divided as many as five times after 72 h of co-stimulation ( peak 6 ) whilst others remained undivided ( peak 1 ) .
T cells from Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice consistently exhibited fewer cell divisions in response to anti-CD3/CD28 treatment , as evidenced by reduced peak sizes and a smaller percentages of divided cells .
19.0 % of the alive T cells remained undivided in the control T cell population , whereas 36.9 % of the alive T cells of Ick-Madl transgenic T cells remained undivided ( Figure 6a , left panel and table ) .
This indicates that the initial GO-G1 entry into the cell cycle is clearly inhibited by Madl transgene expression .
To investigate the effects of Madl expression on cells already in cycle , splenic T cells that had already divided three times ( peak 4 ) were sorted and re-plated for 24 h in the presence of IL-2 on anti-CD3/CD28 coated plates .
The CFSE profiles from both transgenic mice and control littermates were then compared .
We observed negligible differences between CFSE profiles of control and thymocytes ( Figure 6b ) , indicating that Madl exerts no antiproliferative influence over cells already past the GO0-G1 boundary .
This conclusion was confirmed by CFSE staining combined with Hoechst 33343 staining .
Anti-CD3/CD28 activated , CFSE-stained splenic T cells were incubated with the intercalating dye Hoechst 33343 and analysed by flow cytometry .
Both CFSE-and cell cycle profiles were obtained .
By gating on different peaks in the CFSE profile , the corresponding Hoechst cell cycle profiles were then identified .
The cell cycle distribution of the nondivided population of Oncogene CFSE stained T cells ( peak 1 ) revealed a slightly increased number of T cells in G1 and a reduced number of T cells in S phase in /ck-Madl transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates .
Analysing the cell cycle distribution of cycling cells by gating on a population of already divided T cells ( peak 2 ) showed no difference in the cell cycle profile between wild-type and /ck- Madl transgenic mice supporting the notion that Mad1 inhibits only the entry in the first cycle and does not affect normal cell cycle progression of already cycling T cells ( Figure 6¢ ) .
c-Myc can overcome the proliferation block caused by Mad1 expression The general model of the Myc/Max/Mad1 network holds that proteins of the Mad family compete with Myc for Max and that Mad/Max heterodimers compete with Myc/Max heterodimers for binding to DNA .
However , neither relative affinities of Myc and Mad proteins for Max and DNA , nor the precise stoichio-metries of Myc and Mad proteins in normal cells have been well defined .
However , it is known that normal cells express very low levels of c-Myc protein and that levels of c-Myc in tumor cells can be up to 100 times higher ( Moore et al. , 1998 ) .
To test in vivo the notion that Myc and Madl compete functionally , we crossed our Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice with mice expressing the 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) -dependent c-MycER '' * '' protein under the control of the proximal ick promoter .

One representative experiment out of three experiments is shown 1171 c-MycERY in vivo .
After 9-12 days of daily 4-OHT administration , mice were analysed for proliferation in response to anti-CD3/CD28 activation .
Purified T cells from double transgenic Ick-o-mycER '' /lIck-Mad1 mice and their control littermates were CFSE stained and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 72 h. When analysed by flow cytometry , the stimulated T cells from Ick-comycER '' '' transgenic mice ( Figure 7b ) exhibited increased proliferation relative to cells from a wild-type control littermate ( Figure 7a ) .
The phenotype of the Ick-oompycER '' '' transgenic mice is therefore opposite to that shown by transgenic mice which show less proliferation compared to a wild-type control after anti-CD3/CD28 activation ( Figures 4 and 6 ) .
In contrast to single transgenic mice , T cells from Ick-oomycER/Ick-Mad1 double transgenic mice injected with 4-OHT showed a proliferation profile similar to that of Ick-comycER transgenic mice ( Figure 7c¢ ) , indicating that activation of c-mye in vivo can overcome the suppression of proliferation caused by Madl expression .
The effect was absolutely dependent on the presence of 4-OHT since T cells from double transgenic mice in which c-mye was not activated ( oil injection ) showed a proliferation profile identical to that of Ick-Mad ! l transgenic littermates ( Figure 7d ) .
Thus , we conclude that Myc and Madl compete on the same pathway though we can not exclude the possiblity that Myc simply acts downstream of Madl in a completely independent way .

Purified splenic T cells from 4-OHT-injected control littermates ( wt ) , ick-Mad ! 1 transgenic mice ( Mad1 ) , ick-c-mycER '' '' '' transgenic mice ( MycER '' ** '' ) and double transgenic /ck-c-transgenic mice were CFSE stained and plated in the presence or absence of immobilized anti-CD3/CD28 antibody .
Seventy-two hours after plating , T cells were harvested and analysed by flow cytometry .
The result from a representative experiment is shown Discussion Madl is a sequence-specific DNA binding bHLHZip protein identified through interaction with Max , the common partner in the Myc/Max/Madl1 network ( Ayer et al. , 1993 ) .
The notion that Mad proteins antagonize functionally the activities of the Myc protein family ( Ayer et al. , 1993 ; Hurlin et al. , 1995 ; Amati et al. , 1994 ) is based upon three in vitro observations .
First , the ability of Madl to compete with Myc for binding to its partner protein Max ; second , the ability of Madl1/Max heterodimers to compete with Myc/Max heterodimers for sequence-specific DNA binding sites and third the opposing transcriptional activities of Mad1 and Myc as repressor and activator , respectively .
If these in vitro data hold true in vivo , we would presume that transgenic expression of Ick-Mad1 would antagonize the function of endogenous c-myc ( Ayer et al. , 1992 ; Amati et al. , 1993 ) .
However , there is as yet no evidence that Madl can suppress Myc action in vivo .
Moreover , it is possible that Mad proteins , which are potent transcriptional repressors , exert other functions in addition to antagonizing Myc .
We therefore decided to examine the effects of perturbing the Myc/Max/Madl1 network in vivo by transgenic expression of Madl in thymus and peripheral T cells - tissues in which ontogeny , proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis , all important attributes of the Myc/Max/Mad1 network , play important parts .
In fact , one existing study has examined the effect of transgenic expression of Max under control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enchancer ( E ) in T cells and shown that Max attenuates Myc-induced lympho-proliferation and lymphomagenesis in Myc/Max double transgenic mice ( Lindemann et al. , 1995 ) .
However , because Max is the central shared component within the Myc/Max/Mad1 network , it has the capability of enhancing not only Myc but also Madl activity , making interpretation of this study difficult .
We chose to examine the effect of ectopic expression of the Madl protein in vivo by generating transgenic mice expressing Madl under the control of the T cell specific proximal /ck promoter .
Perhaps surprisingly , Oncogene these mice display apparently normal T cell development with no significant effect on the representation of various thymocyte sub populations .
This is similar to the findings of a recent study in which Max was transgenically expressed in B cells under the control of the immunoglobulin Ep heavy chain enchancer .
The distribution of different T cell sub populations appeared normal in Epu-Max mice ( Lindemann et a/. , 1995 ) .
The observed robust homeostasis of T lymphocyte development , even in the face of major experimental genetic manipulation , is well acknowledged even though its basis remains a mystery .
To analyse the effect of /ck-Madl1 expression on T cell development in detail , we used the H-Y-TCR model for T cell selection ( von Boehmer , 1990 ) .
Our analysis indicates that deregulated Madl expression exerts effects on positive thymocyte selection reducing the efficiency of the generation of CD8* SP .
One obvious feature of the Ick-Mad1-transgenic mice was a marked reduction in lymphoid cellularity , accompanied by an impaired T cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA treatment in vitro .
This raises the possibility that the reduced in vivo lymphoid cellularity induced by Madl expression arises by inhibition of proliferation during the early phase of thymocyte proliferation .
The block in proliferation observed in ick-Mad ! l thymocytes and T cells in vitro is consistent with a recently published report showing increased proliferation of mxi-'~- T cells in response to anti-CD3/CD28 treatment ( Schreiber-Agus et al. , 1998 ) , matched by an increase in the percentage of mxi-'- splenic T cells exiting from G1 phase .
As might be expected from the broad pattern of expression of Myc and Mad proteins , the suppressive effect of Mad1 expression on proliferation does not appear to be cell type specific .
Ectopic expression of Madl inhibits NIH3T3 cell line proliferation in response to activation of the CSF-1 receptor , leading to a significant increase of the fraction of G1 phase cells ( Roussel et a/. , 1996 ) , whereas cell cycle exit of granulocytic precursors from Mad-'~- mice is inhibited relative to control cells ( Foley et al. , 1998 ) .
Notably , the growth-inhibitory effect of Madl we observe on thymocytes is overcome by co-expression of c-Myc , consistent with the notion that Myc and Mad compete for their antagonistic functions on cell proliferation .
What might be the mechanism by which Madl expression suppresses thymocyte proliferation ?
Initiation of T lymphocyte proliferation involves activation of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) and the CD28 co-receptor by antigens or activating antibodies which initiates an intracellular cascade of signalling events culminating in activation of critical genes such as c-myc and IL-2 that are required for T cell proliferation .
Autocrine stimulation by IL-2 is absolutely required for Tcell proliferation , raising the possibility that one effect of Madl expression might be the inhibition of IL-2 synthesis or secretion .
However , this does not seem to be the case since addition of recombinant IL-2 to antiCD3/CD28 stimulated /Ick-Mad1 transgenic thymocytes and splenic T cells failed to restore proliferation to normal levels .
A similar observation has also been made in mice expressing IxB « or FADD DN under the control of the proximal ick promoter ( Boothby et al. , 1997 ; Zoernig et al. , 1998 ) , both of which also show a profound block in T cell proliferation .
To investigate further the mechanism underlying the block of T cell proliferation in /ck-Mad ! l transgenic mice , we analysed the behaviour of a number of key molecules implicated in G1 phase cell cycle progres-sion .
Activation of Myc in arrested RATIA-MycER fibroblasts stimulates expression of both cyclin E and cyclin A ( Janser-Duerr et al. , 1993 ) and S phase entry is preceded by increased levels of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity ( Steiner et al. , 1995 ) .
However , in thymocytes from our /ck-Madl transgenic mice , kinetics and levels of expression of G1 phase cedks , cyclins and the cdk inhibitors p21 and p27 in response to anti-CD3/CD28 treatment all appeared identical to that of control thymocytes .
Only cyclin A , a typical S phase cyclin , appeared to be altered in /Ick-Mad !
thymocytes , consistent with a block in cell cycle progression at the transition from G1 into S phase .
These data support the notion that Mad proteins function to regulate cell growth by regulating the exit from G1 phase ( Roussel et al. , 1996 ; Foley et al. , 1998 ) .
We next investigated whether Mad1-induced growth arrest might be p53-dependent .
However , loss of p53 had no effect on the ability of Mad to suppress T cell proliferation .
Consistent with this observation , p53 also did not seem to be required for Myc-induced proliferation .
Consistently , ectopic expression of c-mye induces proliferation in p53-~- MEFs ( Hermeking and Eick , 1994 ; Wagner et al. , 1994 ) .
The relationship between proteins of the Myc/Max/Mad1 network and p53 is unclear .
However , p53 has been implicated in mediating Myc-induced apoptosis ( Hsu et al. , 1995 ) , although this probably reflects synergy between the two rather than a dependence of one on the other ( Juin et al. , 1999 ) .
Nonetheless , mice transgenically expressing c-myc on a p53 negative background show accelerated development of malignant lymphomas ( Hsu et a/. , 1995 ; Elson et al. , 1995 ) .
Analysis of Mad1 function in T cells using Ick-Mad1 transgenic mice B Rudolph et al a The notion that Madl can act as a p53-independent tumor suppressor is an intriguing one that has never been tested directly .
However , there are observations that support the idea .
First , Madl suppresses c-myc-induced transformation in rat embryo fibroblasts ( Lahoz et al. , 1994 ) .
Second , madl maps to a chromosomal region altered in certain human tumors ( Edelhoff , 1994 ) .
Third , an adenovirus vector encoding Madl dramatically inhibits the tumorigenicity of human astrocytoma cells in nude mice ( Chen et a/. , 1995 ) .
Thus , manipulation of Mad family members may be an effective way of suppressing cell growth even in tumors lacking functional p53 .
Materials and methods Generation of transgenic mice A cDNA encoding human Madl ( Ayer et al. , 1993 ) was cloned into the BamHI cloning site of the transgenic expression vector p1070 ( Chaffin et al. , 1990 ) .

Briefly , purified splenic T cells were resuspended at a density of maximal 1x 10 ' cells per ml in 0.1 % BSA/PBS .
CFSE was added to a final concentration of 10 uM and cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 min .
