Scharff , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx , NY , August 6 , 1998 ( received for review June 8 , 1998 ) ABSTRACT The molecular mechanism involved in the process of antigen-driven somatic hypermutation of Ig genes is unknown , but it is commonly believed that this mechanism is restricted to the Ig loci .
B cell lymphomas commonly display multiple somatic mutations clustering in the 5'-regulatory region of BCL-6 , a proto-oncogene encoding for a POZ/Zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B cells and required for GC formation .
To determine whether BCL-6 mutations represent a tumor-associated phenomenon or reflect a physiologic mechanism , we screened single human tonsillar GC B cells for mutations occurring in the BCL-6 5'-noncoding region and in the Ig variable heavy chain sequences .
Thirty percent of GC B cells , but not naive B cells , displayed mutations in the 742 bp region analyzed within the first intron of BCL-6 ( overall frequency : 5 x 10~+/bp ) .
Accordingly , an expanded survey in lymphoid malignancies showed that BCL-6 mutations are restricted to B cell tumors displaying GC or post-GC phenotype and carrying mutated Ig variable heavy chain sequences .
These results indicate that the somatic hypermutation mechanism active in GC B cells physiologically targets non-Ig sequences .
Somatic hypermutation is one of the mechanisms by which Ig genes are modified in B cells to generate a large repertoire of B lymphocytes , each expressing a unique antibody molecule ( 1 ) .
This process is activated in germinal center ( GC ) B cells ( 2-4 ) , where it introduces mutations in the variable region of Ig genes ( IgV ) at a frequency of 2-8 x 10-2 in humans ( 5 ) .
The mechanism involved in IgV hypermutation is not known , although experimental evidence suggests that it requires transcription of the target sequences and the presence of the Ig enhancer but not a specific promoter ( 6-8 ) .
It is generally assumed that the process of somatic hypermutation is restricted to the Ig loci including heavy and light chain variable region genes ( 1 ) .
However , B cell lymphomas were shown to display somatic hypermutation of the 5'-noncoding region of BCL-6 ( 9 , 10 ) , a proto-oncogene encoding a POZ/Zinc finger transcriptional repressor normally expressed within GC B cells and required for GC formation ( 11-20 ) .
In 30 % of diffuse large cell lymphoma ( DLCL ) and 5-10 % of follicular lymphoma ( FL ) , the BCL-6 gene is altered structurally by chromosomal translocations ( 11 ) .
In addition , mutations of its 5'-noncoding region were frequently found in DLCL and FL even in the absence of translocations involving this locus ( 9 , 10 ) .
In most tumor cases , mutations were multiple , often biallelic , and clustered in the 5 ' regulatory sequences at frequencies ( 7 X 107 '' through 1.6 X 10-*/bp ) The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

11816 comparable with that of IgV genes in B cells ( 9 ) .
These findings raised the question of whether BCL-6 mutations represent a tumor associated misfunction or the effect of the IgV hypermutation process acting on non-Ig genes .
To address this issue , we have investigated the presence of BCL-6 mutations in normal GC and naive B cells by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of DNA from single cells .
This approach allows the analysis of multiple genes and alleles from a specific cell , eliminating Taq polymerase-mediated misincorporations ( 21 ) .
We also have analyzed BCL-6 and Ig heavy-chain V ( Ig Vy ) mutations in B cell lymphomas representative of various stages of B cell development , including GC , pre- and post-GC stages .
The results demonstrate that BCL-6 mutations , like IgV mutations , are found in normal GC cells as well as in their GC and post-GC neoplastic counter-parts .
These findings indicate that the somatic hypermutation mechanism affecting Ig genes can physiologically target non-Ig sequences , with implications for normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue Samples .
Tumor biopsies from 341 patients were collected during standard diagnostic procedures based on morphologic , immunophenotypic , and cytogenetic analysis .
The fraction of neoplastic cells corresponded to > 70 % in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases and at least 30 % in multiple myeloma .
In addition , 13 Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines were included in the panel .
Genomic DNA was prepared by the salting-out procedure .
For the single-cell study , a reactive tonsil from a S-year-old child and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an unrelated donor were used .
Cell Separation and Flow Cytometry .
The protocol for purification of single tonsillar CD38+CD77+ and CD38+CD77- GC B cells has been reported ( 22 ) .
For the isolation of single IgD+CD27- B cells from the peripheral blood of a healthy donor , mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Isopaque density centrifugation , and CD19+ B cells were purified to > 98 % by magnetic cell separation by using the MiniMACS system ( Miltenyi Biotech , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) as described ( 23 ) .
The B cell-enriched cell suspension was preincubated for 5 ' with 1 mg/ml Beriglobin ( Ber-ingwerke , Marburg , Germany ) , a human Ig-fraction , followed by 15 '' with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( isomer 1 ) -conjugated anti-CD27 and biotinylated goat anti-human ( GaH ) -IgD .

ter washing and an additional 5 ' incubation with Beriglobin , the cell suspension was stained with digoxygenated antifluo-rescein isothiocyanate-isomer 1 , washed twice , and incubated on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate-containing anti-Digoxigenin liposomes ( 24 ) for 30 ' under constant agitation .
Single IgD+CD27- B cells were sorted on a FACS 440 ( Becton Dickinson ) directly into PCR tubes containing 20 pul of 1X Expand High Fidelity PCR buffer ( Boehringer Mann-heim ) and 1 ng/ul 58 rRNA .
Single-Cell PCR .
Single cells were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 50°C , followed by 10 ' at 95°C for inactivation of the enzyme .
A seminested multiplex PCR strategy was devised to simultaneously amplify the rearranged Ig V3 genes of the largest V1 , V3 , and Vy4 families , along with the BCL-6 first intron ( 742 bp ) and a 394-bp genomic region of the -globin gene , spanning exon1/intron1/exon2 .
For the first round of amplification , a total number of eight gel-purified oligonucleotides ( 10 when the B-globin was co-amplified ) were used in the same reaction mix .
The Vy family-specific and 3 ' antisense J ; primers have been described ( 21 ) .
Sequences of the oligonucleotides for amplification of the BCL-6 and B-globin genes are available on request .
The concentration of each primer pair was titrated in a PCR assay and varied considerably among the loci to allow concurrent amplification of multiple target genes ( 8.4 nM for the V and Jy primers ; 100 nM each BCL-6 primer and 50 nM each -globin primer ) .
The PCR conditions for the first round of amplification have been reported ( 21 ) .
For the second round of amplification , a 1.5-pl aliquot of the first reaction mix was used as template in separate reactions for each of the five loci analyzed .
The antisense oligonucleotides were replaced by internal primers , and the reaction was carried out in 50 ul of volume containing Expand High Fidelity buffer , 1.5 mM MgC ] ; , 200 wM each dNTP , 200 nM each BCL-6 or B-globin primer , 125 nM for the pairs , and 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase .
Cycling conditions were the following : for the B-globin gene , 95°C for 5 , 65°C for 4 '' , 72°C for 1 '' , followed by 29 cycles at 95°C for 1 '' , 63°C for 30 '' , and 72°C for 1 ' .
For the BCL-6 gene , 95°C for 5 , followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 '' , 57°C for 30 '' , and 72°C for 45 '' .
Programs ended with a final step at 72°C for 7 ' .
The protocol for single cell reamplification of V ; genes has been reported ( 22 ) .
To avoid contamination by DNA throughout the procedure , separate working areas were designated for pre- and post-PCR manipulations , and negative water controls were included for every cell in all the experiments ( r = 200 ) .
Cloning Procedure .
Cloning into pGEM-T vector ( Promega ) was required for confirmation of BCL-6 mutations in two tumor cases as well as in those cells in which the occurrence of insertions/deletions in heterozygosis induced a frameshift , preventing evaluation of the downstream sequences .
Ligated PCR products were transformed into DHS @ competent cells and at least four clones/reaction were sequenced .
Sequencing Analysis .
PCR products were purified by using the Wizard PCR Preps kit ( Promega ) and directly sequenced from both strands by using the same primers as in the second amplification reaction , with two additional internal oligonucleotides for the larger BCL-6 product ( 10 ) .
The procedure was accomplished by the dideoxy chain termination method on a ABI373A sequencer ( Perkin-Elmer , Applied Biosystems ) .
Sequencing analysis and alignments were performed by using the GCG package ( Genetics Computer Group , Madison , WI ) and the GenBank data library as well as DNAPLOT ( www .
genetik.uni-koeln.de ) for comparison of the rearranged IgV genes to the most homologous germline sequences .
Ig Vx amplicons representing either non-Ig sequences ( r = 2 ) or double sequences ( as in case both alleles are rearranged by using the same Vy family ) were not considered for analysis .

RESULTS BCL-6 Mutations in Normal GC B Cells .
To investigate whether normal B cells display mutations in their BCL-6 gene , human B cell populations corresponding to GC centroblasts ( CD38+CD77+ ) and centrocytes ( CD38+CD77- ) as well as naive B cells ( sIgD+ CD27- ) were isolated individually by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from a reactive tonsil and the peripheral blood of healthy donors .
In these cells , we analyzed a BCL-6 742-bp genomic region previously shown to represent the major cluster of mutations in DLCL and FL ( Fig .
1 ) .
Using a multiplex seminested single-cell PCR approach , we generated amplicons from the BCL-6 intron 1 and the rearranged IgV ; genes of the same cell and analyzed them by direct sequencing .
In a subset ( n = 36 ) of the cells , the nontranscribed B-globin gene was coamplified and sequenced as a control for locus specificity of the mutations .
The results indicate that the BCL-6 gene is altered by somatic mutations in ~30 % GC lymphocytes but not in naive B cells ( Table 1 ; Fig .
1 ) .
No significant differences in the frequency of mutated cells were observed between the two GC-derived subpopulations , centroblasts and centrocytes .
The percentage of mutated GC cells most likely represents an underestimate because only one allele could be amplified in 43 % ( 50/116 ) of the cells analyzed .
The allelic status could be assessed based on the presence of three linked polymorphisms [ two previously described ( 9 ) and a G/A substitution in position +858 ] occurring in heterozygosis in the subject investigated ( not shown ) .
Sequencing analysis of BCL-6 amplicons in centroblasts and centrocytes revealed a frequency of mutations of 0.07 and 0.04 x 10-2/bp , respectively ( range : 0-0.4 x 10-/bp , corresponding to 0-3 mutations per allele ) .
This frequency was significantly higher than that observed in naive B cells ( 0.009 x 10-2/bp ; P = 0.01 ) , which , in turn , was indistinguishable from the Taq misincorporation rate ( see results of the B-globin analysis ) ( Table 1 ) .
Similarly , the average frequency of mutations in the Ig V , ; genes from GC B cells was ~5 X 10-*/bp , whereas most naive B cells displayed Vy sequences in germline configuration , as expected ( 4 , 23 , 26 ) .
The 2 Vp-mutated cells most likely represented accidentally sorted non-naive B cells .
The BCL-6 sequences could not be analyzed in these cases because a positive PCR product was not obtained .
The B-globin gene , successfully amplified in 32/36 centroblasts , was consistently found unmutated ( Table 1 ) .
These results indicate that a cell-specific , locus-specific hypermutation mechanism targets BCL-6 sequences in normal GC cells .
The frequency of mutations appeared to be 10- to 100-fold lower than that observed in rearranged IgV ; genes from the same cells .
BCL-6 Mutations are Restricted to Neoplasms Derived from GC or Post-GC Cells and Carrying IgVy Mutations .
To corroborate the specific association among BCL-6 mutations , IgV mutations , and GC transit , we screened for BCL-6 and Ig Vx mutations a panel of B cell tumors representative of various stages of B cell differentiation , including pre-B cells ( acute lymphoblastic leukemia : ALL ) , pre-GC ( mantle cell lymphoma ) ( 27 ) , GC- ( DLCL , FL , BL ) and post GC- ( multiple myeloma : MM ) derived tumors .

Distribution of mutations within the BCL-6 5'-noncoding sequences of 37 single GC B cells .

Coding and noncoding exons are indicated by filled and empty boxes , respectively .
The PCR fragment amplified for mutational analysis is approximately positioned below the map and blown up in the lower panel to show the distribution of mutations .
Each line represents a 20-bp interval of the BCL-6 sequence amplified , and the first nucleotide of the BCL-6 cDNA is designated as position +1 .
Mutations included single base pair substitutions ( closed ovals ) and deletions ( brackets ) .
For each cell , identified by its code number , the type and exact position of the mutation are specified on the right column ( A , deletion ) .
Note that all of the 68 nucleotide exchanges , including deletions , were found in heterozygosis when both alleles were amplified ( cells marked by an asterisk ) .
mutated IgV genes in up to 40 % of cases ( 28 ) , also were included in the panel , along with T cell-derived malignancies and non-lymphoid malignancies .
Because tumors reflect the clonal history of their cell of origin , we postulated that if BCL-6 and IgV sequences were targeted by the same mechanism , the respective frequency and distribution of mutations should correlate in the various histologic categories .
A total number of 354 tumor samples was investigated for BCL-6 mutations by SSCP in the same region analyzed in normal cells .
Sequence variants were found at significant frequency in lymphoid malignancies derived from GC ( DLCL , FL , BL ) , post-GC ( MM ) , and CD5S+ B cells ( CLL ) , but not from pre-B cells ( 0/19 ALL ) or pre-GC B cells ( 1/19 mantle cell lymphoma ) ( Table 2 ) .
Two of 15 ( 13 % ) peripheral T cell lymphomas also displayed an altered migration pattern upon SSCP analysis ; the occurrence of BCL-6 mutations in these Table 1. cases may reflect the activity of the somatic hypermutation mechanism in CD4+ T cells within the GC , as suggested by the observation that these cells accumulate mutations in their T cell receptor a and B V genes ( 29 , 30 ) .
This possibility could not be tested due to the lack of material from these particular cases .
No BCL-6 mutations were found in non-lymphoid malignancies , which lack Ig Vy mutations .
To comparatively examine the frequency and type of mutations occurring in the BCL-6 and Ig V , genes , we analyzed the mutated sequences in a subset of cases representative of the main categories of B cell lymphomas , including mantle cell lymphoma , CLL , BL , FL , DLCL , and MM .
The frequency of BCL-6 and IgVy mutations correlated in different tumor subtypes , with BCL-6 substitutions being consistently lower ( Fig .
2 ) .

which the occurrence of BCL-6 substitutions was restricted to the subset carrying Ig V ; mutations ( 28 ) .
These findings indicate that BCL-6 mutations are introduced in the same tumor types as IgV mutations , suggesting their derivation from a common mechanism .
Features of BCL-6 and IgVy Mutations in Normal and Transformed Cells .
The comparative analysis of 636 independent substitutions from the BCL-6 5'-noncoding region ( r = 124 ) and the Ig Vy genes ( n = 512 ) in normal GC cells and DLCL is summarized in Table 3 .
For both BCL-6 and Ig Vx mutations , the frequency was higher in tumor than in normal GC cells .
For both loci , mutations almost were exclusively represented by single base pair substitutions , and transitions were more common than transversions ( BCL-6 : 55 % vs. 45 % in normal B cells and 54.5 % vs. 45.5 % in DLCL , despite the potential for twice as many transversion events ) .
In the two categories analyzed , small deletions represented 3 % and 5.3 % of the mutations , respectively .
However , no significant differences in the frequency of mutations affecting each base were found after correction for the base composition of the BCL-6 region ( in normal GC cells , C = 33 % , G = 24 % , T = 22 % , and A = 21 % ; in DLCL , C , G , T , and A substitutions accounted p 25 1.6 - o BCL-6 o pa PS * IgVH a .

Thus , the mutation pattern of BCL-6 does not indicate a preferential bias of A : N over T : N templates , suggesting the absence of strand polarity , a feature reported for IgV mutations ( Table 3 ) ( 31 ) .
A variety of studies have recognized specific nucleotide motifs within the Ig genes as intrinsic hotspots for somatic hypermutation : among them , the consensus RGYW ( where R = purine , Y = pyrimidine , and W = A or T ) appears to be the most frequently mutated one ( 31-33 ) .
To determine whether there is preferential targeting of the RGYW motif in the BCL-6 locus , the number of G mutations within the RGYW motif was normalized for its frequency in the region investigated and compared with the expected frequency of mutations in both normal GC B cells and DLCLs .
For BCL-6 , the actual occurrence of bp changes within the RGYW motif was found to differ from that expected by chance alone ( P < 0.05 ) , suggesting the existence of a preferential targeting .
This bias , however , was less evident than in the IgV » sequences ( P < 0.001 ) ( Table 3 ) .
Taken together , these observations indicate that the features of BCL-6 and IgV mutations are similar , consistent with both sets of mutations being produced by the same mechanism .
DISCUSSION This study reports that the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene is targeted by a somatic hypermutation mechanism operating in normal GC B cells .
An analysis of transformed counterparts of B cells at various differentiation stages confirms a close association among BCL-6 mutations , IgV mutations , and GC transit .
These findings provide evidence that somatic hypermutation is not limited to the Ig locus in B cells , with implications for the mechanism of hypermutation as well as its role in B cell function and lymphomagenesis .
Relationship Between BCL-6 and IgV Mutations .
Several observations suggest that BCL-6 mutations may be due to the same mechanism generating IgV mutations in B cells .
First , our results show that in both normal and malignant cells BCL-6 mutations selectively occur in GCs , the physiologic site of IgV hypermutation ( 1-4 ) .
The detection of BCL-6 mutations in a subset of CLL cases also is consistent with this notion because the same cases displayed nucleotide exchanges in their Ig Vx loci , indicating a GC transit of the putative precursor cell .
Second , BCL-6 mutations share most of the features of IgV mutations , including the preference for single base pair substitutions with a small number of deletions , the predominance of transitions over transversions , and some degree of preferential motif ( RGYW ) targeting ( 22 , 31-35 ) .
Third , both BCL-6 and IgV mutations are associated with transcribed sequences .
Intriguingly , BCL-6 mutations , as IgV mutations , are scattered within 2 kb from the transcriptional initiation site ( 36 ) .
The frequency of BCL-6 mutations appears to be significantly lower than that of IgVy mutations in both normal and neoplastic cells .
The basis for this difference is not known , but it does not seem to correlate with a lower transcription rate , because the BCL-6 gene is transcribed at high levels in GC cells ( 16 ) .
While this manuscript was in preparation , another study has reported the occurrence of BCL-6 mutations in normal B cells ( 37 ) .
The frequency , type , and distribution of nucleotide substitutions are similar in the two studies , although a strand bias was noted by Shen et al .
( 37 ) that was not detectable in our analysis .
Overall , these data strongly suggest that BCL-6 and IgV mutations represent the product of the same mechanism .
Implications for the Somatic Hypermutation Mechanism .
The identification of a new locus undergoing somatic hypermutation in normal B cells prompted a reexamination of some of the known functional requirements for the IgV hypermutation mechanism .
The BCL-6 5'-noncoding region and the IgV sequences do not share primary sequence homologies , consistent with the observation that somatic hypermutation is a target sequence-independent process and does not require a specific promoter ( 7 , 8 ) .
The occurrence of BCL-6 mutations downstream of the promoter region is comparable with that observed in rearranged IgV genes , suggesting that the hypermutation process may be targeted to a specific distance from the transcription initiation site ( 7 , 33 ) .
As IgV hypermutation requires the Ig enhancer , it is conceivable that the BCL-6 locus also contains a cis-acting transcriptional control element structurally or functionally similar to the Ig enhancer .
The identification of such an element should provide insight into the mechanism by which hypermutation is targeted to specific loci .
Role of BCL-6 Mutations in Normal and Transformed B Cells .
The functional significance of mutations introduced into the BCL-6 5'-regulatory region of normal B cells is unknown .
Because these mutations have been found at a comparable frequency in normal memory B cells ( 37 ) as well as in multiple myeloma , which represents transformed plasma cells , our study indicates that cells carrying BCL-6 mutations are neither significantly counterselected nor positively selected in the GC .
The pattern of mutations is not clearly different in normal and malignant B cells , suggesting that most of the mutations found in tumors may not have any pathologic effect .
However , initial studies on several tumor-derived BCL-6 alleles indicate that few mutations can significantly deregulate BCL-6 expression , whereas others are apparently functionally irrelevant or associated with silent alleles ( unpublished observations ) .
The ~740-bp intronic sequence corresponding to the major cluster of BCL-6 mutations contains several regions of high evolutionary conservation , suggesting that some mutations may hit regulatory domains of the BCL-6 gene and influence its mode of expression .
A functional dissection of the BCL-6 5'-noncoding region is needed to address these issues .
Finally , the identification of BCL-6 mutations suggests the possibility that other sequences may be subjected to the hypermutation process in GCs .
Thus , it is possible that the role of somatic hypermutation is not limited to generate antibody diversity in B cells .
Structural and functional similarities Immunology : Pasqualuceci et al .
between BCL-6 and Ig loci may be useful to identify other possible targets of the hypermutation process .
