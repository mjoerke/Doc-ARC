MENDELSOHN* , YAN ZHU , AND SARAK O'NEILL Cardiovascular Division , Department of Medicine , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , and Center for Research in Cardiovascular Biology , Brockton/WRVA Medical Center , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 Communicated by Eugene Braunwald , September 23 , 1991 ( received for review June 3 , 1991 ) ABSTRACT - Thrombin plays a critical role in platelet activation , hemostasis , and thrombosis .
Cellular activation by thrombin leads to the phosphorylation of multiple proteins , most of which are unidentified .
We have characterized several 29-kDa proteins that are rapidly phosphorylated following exposure of intact human platelets to thrombin .
A murine monoclonal antibody raised to an unidentified estrogen receptor-related 29-kDa protein selectively recognized these proteins as well as a more basic , unphosphorylated 27-kDa protein .
Cellular activation by thrombin led to a marked shift in the proportion of protein from the 27-kDa unphosphorylated form to the 29-kDa phosphoprotein species .
Using this antibody , we isolated and sequenced a human cDNA clone encoding a protein that was identical to the mammalian 27-kDa heat shock protein ( HSP27 ) , aproteinofuneertainfnnctionthatisknowntobe phosphorylated to several forms and to be transcriptionally induced by estrogen .
The 29-kDa proteins were confirmed to be phosphorylated forms of HSP27 by immunoprecipitation stud-ies .
Thus , the “ estrogen receptor-related protein '' is HSP27 , and the three major 29-kDa proteins phosphorylated in thrombin-activated platelets are forms of HSP27 .
These data suggest a role for HSP27 in the signal transduction events of platelet activation .
e Thrombin is the most potent physiologic agonist of platelet activation ( 1-3 ) and initiates platelet secretion and aggregation in the developing thrombus by activating several important Signal transduction pathways ( for review , see ref .
4 ) .
One thrombin receptor has recently been cloned and shown to have a novel proteolytic mechanism of activation ( 5 ) .
However , the subsequent steps in platelet activation by thrombin and the contributions of known signal transduction pathways to specific platelet activation events are less well understood .
Protein kinase-mediated events are ubiquitous in cellular activation ( for reviews , see refs .
6 and 7 ) .
The kinases involved in cellular Signaling are only partially characterized , however ( 8 ) , and little is known about the specific cellular substrates phosphorylated in response to physiologic ago-nists .
Platelet activation by thrombin leads to marked increases in the level of [ *P ] phosphate incorporation by a number of proteins ( 2 , 9 , 10 ) .
Studies to date have emphasized the phosphorylation of a 20-kDa protein identified subsequently as the light chain of myosin and the 40- to 47-kDa protein kinase C substrate ( s ) ( 2 , 4 ) .
Three unidentified 29-kDa proteins have also been shown to be phosphorylated in platelets activated by a variety of physiologic agonists ( 11 ) and to be similar or identical to proteins in fibroblasts ( 11 ) and endothelial cells ( 12 ) .

§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
11212 The heat shock proteins consist of a number of highly conserved proteins thought to play a protective role in cells subjected to high temperature or other stresses ( reviewed in refs .
13 and 14 ) .
Evidence suggests that these proteins are synthesized for reasons in addition to thermotolerance and are present ( and often essential ) for normal cell functions ( 14 ) .
The high molecular weight heat shock proteins HSP90 , HSP70 , and HSP60 ( GroEL ) , have been studied in greatest detail ( 14 ) .
These proteins have been implicated as molecular *'chaperones '' ' in some interactions , such as that between HSP90 and steroid receptor complexes ( 15 ) or between HSPI0 and protooncogene products with tyrosine kinase activity ( 13 ) .
However , even with these two examples the precise function of the HSP90 , the nature and role of other associated proteins , and the role of HSP90 phosphorylation remain unclear ( 13-15 ) .
The low molecular weight heat shock proteins are the least well understood members of the heat shock protein family ( 13 ) .
At least three potential levels of regulation exist for the low molecular weight heat shock proteins : their synthesis is temperature-induced ; they are induced as well at specific developmental stages at normal temperature ; and they are phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of stimuli ( 13 , 14 ) .
In this report we characterize three major 29-kDa proteins phosphorylated following platelet activation by throm-bin , identify these phosphoproteins as forms of HSP27 , and establish that the previously unidentified estrogen receptor-related protein ( 16 ) is HSP27 .

Platelet Isolation and Separation .
Platelets were isolated from normal volunteers and gel-filtered platelets were prepared ( 17 ) .
All preparations and subsequent experiments were performed at 22°C .
Platelets were pelleted and resuspended in buffer A ( 130 mM NaCl/10 mM trisodium cit-rate/10 mM Tris base/9 mM NaHCO ; /6 mM dextrose/0.9 mM MgCl ; /0.81 mM KH ; , PO , , pH 7.3 ) .
After filtration on Sepharose 2B , platelet aliquots were subjected to various experimental conditions and pelleted at appropriate time points .
For phosphorylation experiments , platelets were resuspended for 1 hr in 2 ml of buffer A containing 1.0 mCi ( 37 MBq ) of P ; , after which they were gel-filtered and entered into expenments as described ( 18 ) .
The term phosphorylatlon as used in this report is synonymous with the net increase in protein-associated *P as detected by autoradiography .
Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis .
Platelet pellets from 0.8-1.9 x 10° platelets ( see figure legends ) were resuspended in lysis buffer and subjected to two-dimensional isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) -SDS/PAGE essentially as described ( 19 ) .
Upon completion , gels were either stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and dried for autoradiography or removed directly for immunoblotting .
Silver staining was performed by the method of Morrissey ( 20 ) .
Molecular weight standards were used to provnde reference values and to localize the 29-kDa proteins in all gels .
Immunobiotting .
For immunoblotting studies , two-dimensional gels from * '' P-labeled platelets were electroblotted to PVDF membranes for 60-90 min at 500 mA , rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and blocked overnight ( 21 ) .
Blots were subsequently incubated with DS antibody at a 1:400 dilution in PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 .
Blots were rinsed extensively and developed using a horseradish peroxidase system followed by diaminobenzidine ( 22 ) .
Immunoblots from immunoprecipitation experiments were prepared from SDS/12.5 % polyacrylamide minigels , and exposed to film or probed with a 1:1000 dilution of a murine monoclonal anti-HSP27 antibody ( a gift from William McGuire , University of Texas , San Antonio ) , and developed as above .
In some experiments , 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the SDS/ PAGE sample buffer to prevent reduction of the DS antibody itself .
Immunoprecipitation .
Experiments were performed essentially as described ( 23 ) using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7.4/50 mM NaCl/50 mM NaF/5 mM EDTA/20 mM sodium pyrophos-phate/1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1 mM Na ; VO , /1 % ( vol/vol ) Triton X-100 .
Immunoprecipitates containing 1-2 x 10° platelets were precleared with protein A-Sepharose prior to addition of DS antibody ( 10-20 ul ) .
After overnight incubation at 4°C with rocking , immune complexes were isolated by addition of protein A-Sepharose , pelleted , and washed three times at 4°C with RIPA buffer .
The pellets were solubilized by addition of SDS/PAGE sample buffer and immunoblots were prepared as above .
Autoradiography .
Dried gels or **P-labeled electroblots were exposed to X-Omat AR film at -70°C in cassettes equipped with DuPont Cronex intensifying screens for various times .
Densitometry was performed on a Molecular Dynamics 300A computing densitometer ( Sunnyvale , CA ) using the integrated volume mode .
Values were expressed in arbitrary densitometric units ( ADU ) .

RESULTS Two-Dimensional IEF-SDS/PAGE Analysis of Protein Phosphorylation in Human Platelets .
An autoradiograph of a two-dimensional gel from *P-labeled platelets followmg thrombin stimulation is displayed in Fig .
1 .
Increases in phosphorylation of a number of proteins were consistently observed in thrombin-stimulated platelets , including three major 29-kDa proteins ( 292-c ) .
Isoelectric points for these proteins ( average of 10 gels ) were as follows : 29a , 6.8 ; 29b , 6.5 ; 29c , 5.7 .
These three phosphoproteins form the subject of this report .
Proteins 29a-c were not visible following staining of two-dimensional gels with Coomassie brilliant blue but could be clearly seen after silver staining ( Fig .
24 ) .
The relative amounts of the three proteins , determined by silver staining , were 29b > > 292 > 29c .
The corresponding pattern of phosphorylation ( Fig .
2B ) demonstrated 29¢ to be most prominently phosphorylated , suggesting that the stoi-chiometry of phosphorylation of 29¢ is higher than that of 292 or 29b .
A small degree of phosphorylation of several cellular proteins is known to occur in resting platelets ( 9 , 10 , 29 ) .

- Silver stain identification of the 29-kDa phosphoproteins in human platelets .
A two-dimensional gel of 10° thrombin-stimulated ( 1 unit/ml , 2 min ) , P-labeled platelets was prepared and subjected to silver staining ( A ) followed by autoradiography ( B ) .
The orientation of the acidic ( + ) and basic ( - ) ends of the first-dimension gel and the position of the 31-kDa molecular size marker are shown .
The phosphorylated proteins 29a-c in B migrated exactly as in Fig .
1 and were directly superimposable on the silver-stained proteins bearing the same labels in A. Phosphorylation of proteins 292-c was minimal in resting platelets , with prominent increases in phosphorylation within 60 sec of stimulation by thrombin ( Fig .
3 ) .
Densitometric analysis revealed that *P incorporation into proteins 292a-c increased 1.6- , 1.5- , and 3.3-fold , respectively , at 30 sec and 2.1- , 4.6- , and 7.1-fold , respectively , at 60 sec .
The degree of phosphorylation at 60 sec was essentially the same as that at 2 min ( cf .
Fig .
4 ) or 4 min of thrombin exposure ( unpublished observations ) .
We consistently observed the small phosphoprotein adjacent to 29¢ as well , which may be a fourth protein form or an artifact ( see below ) .

Extensive attempts to obtain protein sequence for 29a-c from two-dimensional gels transferred to PVDF were unsuccessful , in part because the amino termini of proteins 292a-c were blocked ( unpublished observations ) .
An immunologic approach was simultaneously pursued to identify 292-c , in which candidate antibodies for the platelet proteins were used to screen two-dimensional immunoblots .
DS , a murine monoclonal antibody raised by Coffer et al .
( 16 ) during attempts to obtain antibody to the purified estrogen receptor , had been shown to recognize 29-kDa phosphoprotein ( s ) with characteristics similar to those of the 29-kDa platelet proteins ( 16 , 30 , 31 ) .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) to recognize 29-kDa proteins in samples from human platelets .
Because of recent studies of the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of similar 28- to 30-kDa proteins in endothelial cells ( 12 , 32 , 33 ) , we also examined first-passage *P-labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( kindly provided by M. Gimbrone , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston ) and found that 29-kDa phosphoproteins were similarly detectable with the DS antibody in these cells ( unpublished observations ) .
Two-dimensional immunoblots from *P-labeled platelets demonstrated precise recognition of the phosphorylated proteins 29a-c by antibody DS ( Fig .
4 Upper ) .
In addition , a more basic , unphosphorylated 27-kDa protein ( arrowhead ) was clearly recognized by DS on the immunoblots .
Strikingly , the predominant species in control ( unstimulated ) platelets was the unphosphorylated 27-kDa protein ( Fig .
4 Upper ) , while stimulation of the platelets with thrombin led to a marked decrease in the amount of 27-kDa protein detected and an increase in the amount of each of the three proteins 29a-c on the immunoblots .
The phosphorylation pattern generated from these immunoblots demonstrated a parallel increase in the phosphorylated species 29a-c following thrombin stimulation ( Fig .
4 Lower ; cf .
Figs .
1-3 ) .
Densitometry revealed increases in phosphorylation at 2 min of 2.2- , 5.3- , and 7.7-fold for proteins 292a-c , respectively .
These experiments established that the increase in the intensity of phosphoproteins 292-c by autoradiography was due to an increase in the quantity of proteins 292a-c , as demonstrated by immunoblotting .
The small species adjacent ( acidic ) to 29¢ was also demonstrable on both the immunoblot and the autoradiograph , suggesting that it , too , was either a separate form of the 27-kDa protein or artifactual and derived from protein 29¢ ( cf .
Figs .
1-3 ) .
The data in Fig .
4 provided strong evidence that the 29-kDa phosphoproteins were all forms of the same protein , the unphosphorylated 27-kDa species present on the immunoblots .
This was further supported by previous work in platelets and fibroblasts demonstrating identical electropho-retic patterns for these proteins following limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease ( 11 ) .

Recognition of the 29-kDa phosphoproteins by D5 , a monoclonal antibody directed against an uncharacterized estrogen receptor-related 29-kDa protein .
Two-dimensional gels of *P-labeled platelet lysates ( 10° platelets per gel ) were prepared from unstimu-lated platelets ( control ) or platelets exposed to human thrombin for 2 min ( thrombin ) .
Proteins were then electroblotted to PVDF and probed with DS , an antibody raised against a 29-kDa phosphoprotein copurified with the estrogen receptor ( 16 ) .
The immunoblots ( Upper ) were developed and visualized , dried , and placed on film to generate the corresponding autoradiographs ( Lower ) .
Only a portion of the two-dimensional immunoblots and autoradiographs is displayed ( cf .
Fig .
1 ) .
The phosphoprotems 29a-c ( Lower ) were localized by pi and molecular size as in Fig .
1 , and were superimposable on the corresponding proteins of the immunoblots displayed ( Upper ) .
Along with proteins 29a-c , a more basic 27-kDa protein was evident on the immunoblots ( arrowheads ) .
No other proteins were detected anywhere on the two-dimensional immunoblots .
The control immunoblot contained a faint protein corresponding to 29¢ that is not well reproduced in the figure .

Screening of Human Agt11 Expression Libraries with Monoclonal Antibody DS , Isolation of cDNA , and Identification of the Clone Recognized as Expressing the 27-kDa Heat Shock Protein .
Human Agt11 cDNA expression libraries from platelets ( 25 ) and endothelial cells ( 24 ) were screened .
Screening of ~=150,000 plaques each from a human platelet cDNA library and an oligo ( dT ) -primed endothelial cell library led to the identification of a single plaque from the endothelial library recognized by the DS antibody .
The recombinant was plaque-purified and its DNA insert was subcloned into pBluescript for amplification and sequencing .
Three hundred forty-eight bases were sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequence ( Fig .
5 ) was used to search the Protein Identification Resource data base ( National Biomedical Research Foundation ; May 1991 ) .
The clone identified by the DS antibody was identical to the mammalian 27-kDa heat shock protein , HSP27 ( 34 ) .
To further confirm these findings , the DS antibody was used in immunoprecipitation experiments with resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets ( Fig .
6 ) .
First , immunoprecipitation studies using *P-labeled platelets were performed with the D5 antibody to demonstrate the resting phosphorylation and predicted increase in phosphorylated forms of HSP27 following thrombin stimulation .
Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS/12.5 % PAGE and subjected to autoradiography .
A 3.2-fold increase in total 29-kDa protein phosphorylation was observed 2 min after stimulation with thrombin at 1 unit/ml ( Fig .
6 Leff ) .
No other phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated .
In preliminary immunoprecipitation studies of the time course of phosphorylation , we found near-complete phosphorylation of the 29-kDa proteins within 10 sec following thrombin stimulation ( unpublished observations ) , consistent with a role for these phosphorylation events in platelet signal transduction ( 2 , 4 , 10 , 29 ) .
Further studies will be necessary , however , to quantitate precisely the time course for total 29-kDa phosphorylation and the individual time courses of phosphorylation for 292-c and to correlate these with specific platelet activation events .
Next , a separate anti-HSP27 monoclonal antibody was used to probe immunoblots prepared from DS immunoprecipitates of unlabeled platelets at rest or following thrombin stimulation ( Fig .
6 Right ) .
Immunoprecipitates were resolved in 12.5 % gels , with 2-mercaptoethanol omitted from the sample buffer to prevent reduction of the D5 antibody .
This omission had no effect on the migration of the immunoprecipitated 27- to 29-kDa proteins ( unpublished observations ) .

DISCUSSION Platelet activation in hemostasis and thrombosis is characterized by a number of protein phosphorylation events that are presumed to participate in the morphologic and secretory events that ensue .
The present study characterizes the rapid incorporation of *P into three 29-kDa platelet proteins following cell activation by thrombin .
The observed time course of phosphorylation of proteins 29a-c is consistent with the time course of platelet activation by thrombin and other agonists ( 2 , 4 , 10 , 29 ) , lending support to the potential relevance of these phosphorylation events in platelet signal transduction .
The data presented identify proteins 29a-c as forms of HSP27 , a low molecular weight member of the heat shock protein family .
The small heat shock proteins are ubiquitous and are more diverse than the larger heat shock proteins , differing in number between organisms and divergent in sequence from one organism to another ( 13 ) .
All share carboxyl-terminal homology with the lens structural protein a-crystallin and are able to form large intracellular polymeric aggregates , perhaps through interactions involving this region ( 13 ) .
Conversely , a recent report demonstrated that a B-crystallin is a member of the small heat shock protein family ( 35 ) .
The subcellular distribution of the small heat shock proteins varies , depending on cell type and perhaps as well on different degrees of phosphorylation ( 13 , 36-38 ) , though the functional significance of the different cellular dispositions of the proteins remains unclear .
HSP27 is known to be phosphorylated to several forms during normal cellular events , depending on stimulus and cell type ( 13 , 36 , 39-43 ) .
These studies , and the recognition of three distinct phosphorylated forms of HSP27 in human platelets , suggest that phosphorylation may regulate HSP27 function .
In mammalian cells , varying degrees of HSP27 phosphorylation have been shown following stimulation by phorbol esters , calcium ionophore , or serum ( 36 ) , as well as by the mitogens interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor ( 41 , 42 ) .
However , despite previous pharmacologic attempts to explore HSP27 phosphorylation ( 12 , 33 , 36 , 40 , 42 ) , and the recent identification of two phosphorylation sites in the murine small heat shock protein ( 44 ) , the specific protein kinases involved in the phosphorylation of HSP27 remain unidentified .
The identity between HSP27 and the estrogen receptor-related 29-kDa protein P29 is also noteworthy .
Coffer and colleagues ( 16 , 30 ) first found P29 while preparing antibodies against the estrogen receptor .
Although identification of P29 11216 - Cell Biology : Mendelsohn et al .
remained elusive ( 45 ) , characteristics of the protein suggested to those investigators the application of P29 as a marker for estrogen responsiveness in tumor tissues ( 46 ) .
Working separately , McGuire and colleagues ( 47-49 ) had earlier identified a `` ©24-kDa '' ' protein as such a marker in breast cancer , then demonstrated the 24-kDa protein to be transcriptionally induced by estrogen , and more recently have shown this protein to be HSP27 .
Identification of the estrogen receptor-related protein as HSP27 strongly suggests that HSP27 is both transcriptionally induced by estrogen and interacts with the estrogen receptor , though the latter remains to be established .
If so , this defines a potentially important regulatory loop in estrogen-responsive cells .
The data also allow speculation regarding possible links between estrogen responsiveness and the cells that participate in hemostasis and thrombosis .
The specific role of HSP27 and its phosphorylation in platelet activation events is entirely unknown .
Platelets do not have nuclei , display little protein synthetic function ( 50 ) , and have yet to be demonstrated to be regulated by estrogen or other steroid hormones .
Some possible roles for HSP27 in platelet activation include a chaperone function for an unidentified steroid receptor or other protein ( 14 ) , interaction in a protooncogenic signal transduction pathway ( 11 , 13 , 51 ) , participation in non-nuclear , steroid-mediated events ( 52 ) , or direct participation of one or more of the HSP27 forms in the cytoskeletal , membrane , or secretory reorganizational events that occur with cell activation .
