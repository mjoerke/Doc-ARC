Biochemical Characterization of the NF-Y Transcription Factor Complex during B Lymphocyte Development* ( Received for publication , March 31 , 1998 , and in revised form , May 13 , 1998 ) R. Alexander Currie } From the Laboratory of Gene Regulation , The Wheeler Institute for Biomedical Research , Huntington , New York 11743 The transcription factor , NF-Y , plays a critical role in tissue-specific major histocompatibility complex class II gene transcription .
In this report the biochemical properties of the heterotrimeric NF-Y complex have been characterized during stage-specific B-cell development , and in several class IIC mutant B-cell lines , which represent distinct bare lymphocyte syndrome class II genetic complementation groups .
The NF-Y complex derived from class II* mature B-cells bound with high affinity to anion exchangers , and eluted as an intact trimeric complex , whereas , NF-Y derived from class II~ plasma B-cells , and from bare lymphocyte syndrome group II cell lines , RJ2.2.5 and RM3 , dissociated into discrete NF-YA and NF-YB : C subunit fractions .
Recombination of the MPC11 plasma B-cell derived NF-Y A : B : C complex with the low molecular mass protein fraction , NF-Y-associated factors ( YAFs ) , derived from mature A20 B-cell nuclei , conferred high affinity anion exchange binding to NF-Y as an intact trimeric complex .
Recombination of the native NF-YA : B : C complex with the transcriptional cofactor , PC4 , likewise conferred high affinity NF-Y binding to anion exchangers , and stabilized NF-Y interaction with CCAAT-box DNA motifs in vitro .
Interaction between PC4 and NF-Y was mapped to the C-terminal region of PC4 , and the subunit interaction subdomain of the highly conserved DNA binding-subunit interaction domain ( DBD ) of NF-YA .
These results suggest that in class II* mature B-cells NF-Y is associated with the protein cofactor , PC4 , which may play an important role in NF-Y-mediated transcriptional control of class II genes .
The major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes encode a set of highly polymorphic transmembrane glycopro-teins that mediate several critical immunological processes that include antigen presentation to T helper cells , and the phenomenon of T-cell selection in the thymus ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .

18220 covalent heterodimer on the cell surface of a restricted subset of mammalian cell types ( e.g .
mature B-cells , activated T-cells , macrophages , and the thymic epithelium ) , and their expression is modulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by a variety of cytokines , lymphokines , and hormones ( reviewed in Refs .
3-6 ) .
Additionally , in B lymphocytes MHC class II proteins are regulated in a stage-specific manner , as the high level of constitutive expression observed in mature B-cells is completely extinguished during progression to the plasma B-cell stage through repression at the transcriptional level ( 7 , 8 ) .
Three highly conserved MHC class II DNA elements , the S- , X- , and Y-boxes , have been shown through extensive functional analyses to represent , in large measure , the focal regulatory regions of class II transcriptional control ( 9-12 ) .
The X-box contains two separable functional elements : X1 and X2 , where the X1 motif binds the regulatory factor X ( RFX ) family of transcription factors ( 13 , 14 ) , and the X2 motif binds many members of the fos/jun and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) /activating transcription factor families ( 15 , 16 ) .
In contrast , a single activating transcription factor , the heteromeric nuclear factor-Y ( NF-Y ) , specifically interacts with a CCAAT motif found in all MHC class II gene Y-boxes ( 10 , 17 , 18 ) .
Proteins that interact with the X- and Y-box elements function in a cooperative manner because alterations in their spacing lead to significant reduction in in vivo promoter activity ( 19 ) , and disrupt stabilized complexes formed in vitro with their corresponding proteins ( 20 , 21 ) .
NF-Y binding sites are frequently located within ~50-80 base pairs of promoter transcriptional initiation sites , and also in more distal enhancer control regions of eukaryotic genes ( 22 ) .
In these contexts , the ubiquitous NF-Y factor is often juxtaposed with other general or tissue-restricted transcription factors , which together mediate crucial functional steps in constitutive and inducible gene regulation .
For example , cooperative protein interactions between NF-Y and the CCAAT/en-hancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) , and C/EBP-related proteins , DBP and LAP , have been observed in the murine albumin promoter ( 23 ) , between NF-Y and the serum response factor , p67° '' '' , in the human G-actin promoter ( 24 ) , and between the NF-Y and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP ) in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) promoter ( 25 ) .
In the last example , NF-Y : SREBP acts as a negative-feedback sensor to regulate the transcriptional activity of HMG-CoA in response to serum cholesterol levels .
Initial biochemical characterization of the HeLa cell CCAAT-box factor , CPI ( 26 ) , and the rat liver CCAAT-box factor ( CBF ) ( 27 ) , showed that specific CCAAT-box DNA binding activity was lost following ion exchange chromatography , but could be restored by recombining two separate column fractions .
The two HeLa column fractions , A and B , could also be recombined with the separated Saccharomyces cerevisiae subunit fractions , This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog NF-Y -associated Cofactors in Stage-specific B-cells HAP2 and HAP3 , to reconstitute specific CCAAT-box binding activity ( 28 ) .
These results suggested a heterodimeric structure for this CCAAT factor , which appeared to have been highly conserved in eukaryotes ( 26-29 ) .
Isolation of cDNAs that encoded the murine NF-YA/YB ( 18 ) , and rat CBF-A ( NF-YB ) , and CBF-B ( NF-YA ) subunits ( 30-32 ) provided conclusive evidence of the equivalence of CBF and NF-Y , and showed these subunits to be homologs of the yeast HAP2/3 proteins ( 83-35 ) .
Cloning of an additional S. cerevisice factor , HAP5 ( 86 ) , and CBF-C ( NF-YC ) ( 37 , 38 ) , together with biochemical characterization of the NF-Y complex , has now confirmed the existence of a third subunit and a heterotrimeric structure which is minimally required for specific CCAAT-box DNA binding activity .
Recently , the NF-Y complex has been shown to interact functionally with the non-histone chromosomal high mobility group protein , HMG-I ( Y ) , and a protein-protein interaction site mapped to the NF-YA DNA-subunit interaction domain ( DBD ) in NF-Y , and the AT-hook motif in HMG-I ( Y ) ( 89 ) .
Lack of appropriate MHC class II expression in humans results in a severe autosomal recessive immunodeficient condition known as bare lymphocyte syndrome ( BLS ) ( 6 ) .
The class II~ mutant B-cells in BLS subgroup type II synthesize normal levels of MHC class I , and class -associated invariant chain proteins , whereas expression of all class II isotypes is universally extinguished .
The B-cell-specific gene product , class II transactivator ( CIITA ) , represents the defective gene product in BLS group II class II~ cell lines , and is capable of fully restoring class II gene transcription in this specific genetic complementation group ( 40 ) .
CIITA has been shown to regulate both constitutive class II transcription in mature B-cells ( 40 ) , and mediate interferon-y ( IFN-y ) -induced expression of MHC class II genes during monocyte/macrophage cell differentiation , and in several class II~ cell lines ( 41 , 42 ) .
In addition , endog-enous CIITA mRNA expression has been shown to be completely suppressed in plasma B-cells , whereas unregulated overexpression of CIITA in plasma B-cells surprisingly restores MHC class II mRNA and protein expression to the elevated levels observed in mature B-cells ( 43 ) .
These results suggest active repression of CIITA expression accounts for the dominant suppressor plasma cell phenotype exhibited by mature B : plasma B-cell somatic cell hybrids ( 7 , 8 ) , and further suggest CIITA plays an obligatory role in the normal tissue-specific regulation of MHC class II gene transcription .
Positive cofactor 4 ( PC4 ) , also referred to as p15 ( 44 , 45 ) , was initially identified as an abundant nuclear protein in murine plasmacytoma cells ( 46 ) , and cloned independently on the basis of its differential expression in rat embryo cells and B-cell tumors ( 47 ) , and the ability of this protein to bind polydeoxy-pyrimidines in vitro ( 46 ) .
Subsequently , PC4/p15 was shown to function as a general transcription accessory factor in the response of RNA polymerase II to upstream activator proteins in in vitro reconstituted systems ( 44 , 45 ) .
Phosphorylated PC4 , as modified by casein kinase II ( CKII ) , has been shown to be functionally inactive in reconstituted cell-free in vitro transcription assays , whereas both the purified native non-phos-phorylated , and Escherichia coli derived forms of PC4 , are potent transcriptional activators in vitro ( 45 , 48 ) .
In addition , recent results suggest that PC4 regulation may occur while tethered to specific promoter transcription factors , such as NF-Y ( 39 ) .
In this report , the biochemical ion exchange properties of the NF-Y complex were examined in stage-specific B lymphocytes , and compared with a series of BLS mutant cell lines to determine if tissue-specific changes in NF-Y structure occur during stages of active and inactive MHC class II gene transcription .
The NF-Y complex in class II* mature B lymphocytes was 18221 observed to bind as an intact trimeric complex to anion exchangers .
In contrast , the NF-Y complex derived from class II~ plasma B-cells dissociated into discrete NF-YA and NF-YB : C subunit fractions following anion exchange chromatography .
A protein fraction derived from mature B-cell nuclei , the NF-Y-associated factors ( YAFs ) , in addition to recombinant PC4 , restored Q* binding to the plasma B-cell NF-Y complex as an intact trimeric complex .
These results suggest that , in MHC class II mature B-cells , PC4 functions to stabilize both NF-YA : B : C subunit interactions , as well as NF-Y : CCAAT-box DNA interactions , and further suggest PC4 plays important trans-activator/transrepressor roles in MHC class II gene transcription during B-cell development .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Recombinant Plasmids-Human PC4 was cloned from pPCA4 2T ( 89 ) into the EcoRI site of pGEX2TK ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) using polymerase chain reaction .
GST-PC4 mutants were derived from pPC4 2T using polymerase chain reaction , and cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX2TK .
pPCA4 ( AC37 ) contains the N-terminal 90 amino acids of PC4 ( nucleotides 1-270 as defined ; Ref .
44 ) , pPCA4 ( AN64 ) contains the C-terminal 63 amino acids ( nucleotides 198-884 ) , and pPC4 ( C37 ) contains the C-terminal 37 amino acids of PC4 ( nucleotides 271-384 ) .
pYA ( DBDAC23 ) was prepared by digesting pYA ( DBD ) ( 89 ) with StyI-EcoRI , followed by treatment with the large subunit of DNA polymerase I ( Klenow ) under standard conditions to generate blunt-ends ( 49 ) .
The purified YA ( DBD ) fragment was ligated and plasmids that lacked the C-terminal 28 amino acids of YA ( DBD ) ( nucleotides 1011-1081 , as defined in Ref .
18 ) were identified .
Plasmids were prepared and verified using standard techniques ( 49 ) .
Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins- The cloning , expression , and purification of His-Y¥B , His-YC , glutathione S-transfer-ase ( GST ) , and GST fusion proteins ( YA , YA ( DBD ) , YA ( ADBD ) , PC4 , Dr1 , TFIIB , and HAP2 ( DBD ) ) , and *°P labeling of recombinant proteins using CKII , and heart muscle creatine kinase ( HMK ) have been described previously ( 89 ) .
GST-PC4 ( AC37 ) , GST-PC4 ( C37 ) , GST-PC4 ( AN64 ) , and GST-YA ( DBDAC23 ) were expressed in K. coli DHS50 , and purified from the soluble fraction as described previously ( 39 ) .
Thrombin cleaved recombinant proteins , YA ( DBD ) and PC4 , were further purified to > 95 % by centrifugation through Centricon 30 filtration devices ( Amicon ) in BC-420 ( 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 0.42 M KCl , 20 % glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) , and stored at -80 °C following buffer exchange to BC-100 ( 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 0.1 M KCl , 20 % glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride ) using Centricon 10 devices ( Amicon ) .
Cell Culture and Nuclear Extract Preparation-Cell lines were kindly provided for these studies as follows : A20 ( J. Durdik , University of Arkansas , Fayetteville , AR ) , Raji ( J. Jones , National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine , Denver , CO ) , RJ2.2.5 ( B. Mach , University of Geneva , Geneva , Switzerland ) , RM8 ( M. Peterlin , University of California , San Francisco , CA ) , and 6.1.6 ( D. Pious , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) .
MPC11 cells were obtained from the ATCC , Rockille , MD .
Lymphocyte cell lines were maintained in suspension culture at ~10° cells/ml in RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) which contained 10 % fetal bovine serum ( HyClone ) .
Cell lines were routinely tested for cell surface MHC class II protein using FITC-conjugated species-specific anti-class II antibodies ( PharMingen ) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis .
A20 and Raji cells express high levels of surface MHC class II protein , whereas all other class II~ cell lines tested did not express measurable surface class II molecules . ''
Nuclear extracts were prepared from these , and other cell lines , according to the method of Dignam et al .
( 50 ) , and as described previously ( 39 ) .
Briefly , nuclear extracts were passed over DEAE-Sepharose ( Sigma ) in BC-420 to remove residual nucleic acids , and the flow-through fraction was dialyzed for 5 h against BC-100 using a 10-12-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
Extracts were centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge ( 10,000 rpm for 10 min ) at 4 °C following dialysis to remove insoluble material , and aliquots of the supernatant frozen at -80 °C .
Nuclear extract protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) as the protein standard ( 51 ) , and ranged between ~5-15 mg/ml .

The *°P-Ea DNA oligomer was used in EMSA to normalize nuclear extracts for relative NF-Y CCAAT DNA binding activities for use in comparative chromatographic analyses .
In EMSA , protein fractions were mixed with ~2 ug of the nonspecific DNA competitor , poly ( dI-dC ) ( Amersham Pharmacia Bio-tech ) , prior to addition of ~0.2 ng of *°P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe in a 30-ul binding reaction .
Binding reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min , then loaded onto a 4 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel ( 80:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio ) containing 50 mM Tris , 50 mM boric acid , 1.0 mM EDTA ( 0.5 X TBE ) .
Gels were electrophoresed at ~150 V for 1.5 h following pre-running for 30 min at room temperature using 0.5 x TBE as the running buffer .
Dried gels were exposed to XAR-5 film ( Eastman Kodak Co. ) with an intensifying screen ( DuPont ) at -80 °C .
Chromatographic Procedures-Anion exchangers , Q* Sepharose , DEAE-Sepharose , and the cation exchanger , S~ Sepharose , were prepared according to the manufacturer 's specifications ( Sigma ) , and equilibrated in BC-100 .
Nuclear extracts were depleted of YAF proteins by first passing extracts over DEAE-Sepharose in BC-420 , followed by dialysis against several changes of BC-420 over an 8-h period using a Spectra/Por 6 ( 25-kDa cut-off ) cellulose membrane ( Spectrum ) .
Subsequently , extracts were dialyzed against BC-100 for 4 h and stored at -80 °C , following centrifugation to remove insoluble material .
The NF-YA subunit was prepared from YAF-depleted nuclear extracts by heating nuclear extracts to 65 °C for 5 min , placing extracts on ice for 15 min , then centrifuging ( 10,000 rpm for 10 min ) at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material .
NF-YB : C is effectively inactivated following this heat treatment step ( 87 ) .
NF-YA was further purified by passing this material over Q* Sepharose equilibrated in BC-100 , and collecting the flow-through fraction ( 27 ) .
NF-YA was concentrated using Centricon 10 filtration devices , stored in BC-100 at -80 °C , and used to complement NF-YB : C activity in recombination experiments .
NF-YB : C subunits were isolated following Q* and S % Sepharose chromatographic separations , as described previously ( 27 , 37 ) , with the following modifications .
A20 and MPC11 nuclear extracts , depleted of YAF proteins as described above , were applied to a Q* '' Sepharose column in BC- 100 ( Tris-HCl buffer ) .
Following extensive washing with BC-100 , NF-YB : C was step-eluted using BC-600 ( 0.6 M KC ] , and dialyzed against BC-100 buffer where HEPES had been substituted for Tris- HCl .
This material was loaded onto a S- Sepharose column , and eluted using BC-100 ( HEPES ) .
NF-YB : C elutes in the flow-through fraction , whereas residual NF-YA activity binds tightly to S~ Sepharose under these conditions ( 27 ) .
The NF-YB : C fractions in each case were concentrated using a Centricon 10 filtration device , and the buffer was exchanged to BC-100 ( Tris-HCl ) .
NF-YB : C fractions were stored at -80 °C , and used to complement the NF-YA subunit in recombination experiments .
The elution position of separated NF-Y subunits was identified in Q* Sepharose column fractions by incubating 5 ul of each column fraction with 10 ul of the corresponding complementing partially purified YA or YB : C subunit fraction in a 80-ul EMSA reaction .
In dialysis experiments , an aliquot of an A20 DEAE-Sepharose column flow-through fraction ( 1.0 ml ; ~10 mg of protein ) in BC-420 was dialyzed separately against BC-420 using a 10-12-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , against BC-420 using a 25-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane ( Spectrum ) , and also against BC-100 using a 25-kDa cut-off membrane .
The dialysis buffers were changed in each case after 3 h , and dialysis continued for an additional 3 h at 4 °C .
After this period , all extracts were further dialyzed for 3 h against BC-100 .
Normalized NF-Y Ea DNA binding activities were determined , and assayed for binding to Q* Sepharose .
To prepare NF-Y from nuclear extract fractions depleted of YAF activity A20 or MPC11 nuclear extracts were first passed over DEAE-Sepharose in BC-420 , dialyzed against BC-420 for 8 h using a Spectra/Por 6 ( 25-kDa cut-off ) membrane , then diluted 1:4 in BC-0 buffer .
This material was applied to a heparin-agarose ( Sigma ) column in BC-100 , and the column was developed using a BC-KC ] step gradient .
The NF-Y complex eluted in the 0.42 M KCl step was dialyzed against BC-100 , and aliquots stored at -80 °C A20 NF-Y derived from the heparin-agarose fraction , and used in experiments with recombinant PCA4 , was further purified using a CCAAT-box DNA affinity column as described previously ( 89 ) .
Approximately 100 ug of the affinity-purified NF-Y protein fraction was recombined with either ~50 ug of purified recombinant PC4 , or purified BSA , as described for YAF recombination experiments below .
In native YAF recombination experiments , A20 YAFs were prepared from A20 nuclear extracts that had been passed over DEAE-Sepharose in BC-420 .
The heparin-agarose A20 NF-YA : B : C and MPC11 NF-YA : NF-Y -associated Cofactors in Stage-specific B-cells B : C fractions were compared with A20 nuclear extracts for NF-Y Ea DNA binding activity .
A20 nuclear extracts that contained ~2-fold greater equivalents of CCAAT-box DNA binding activity were used to prepare the A20 YAF fraction by centrifuging the 0.42 m KCl DEAE-Sepharose fraction through a Centricon 30 filtering device ( Amicon ) in a DuPont Sorvall type SM-24 rotor ( 7000 rpm for ~8 h at 4°C ) as described previously ( 89 ) .
The individual heparin-agarose A20 , or MPC11 NF-YA : B : C fraction , was adjusted to 0.42 M KCl , recombined with the Centricon 30 filtrate , and incubated at room temperature for 5 min .
This material was then dialyzed against BC-100 using a 10-12-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane for 3 h at 4 °C to permit protein reas-sociation .
NF-Y complex binding to Q* Sepharose in these recombined fractions was determined following dialysis using EMSA .
The A20 YAF fraction , as prepared using Centricon 30 filtration devices , was depleted of protein by incubation with StrataClean resin according to the manufacturer ( Stratagene ) .
Silica beads were removed by centrifugation , and the depletion procedure was repeated .
This depleted YAF fraction was recombined with A20 NF-YA : B : C , and the NF-Y complex was tested for Q* Sepharose binding using EMSA as described above .
Normalized amounts of NF-Y Ea DNA binding activity were loaded onto ion exchange columns , and developed using a BC-KCl step gradient ( 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.6 , and 1.0 M KC ] ) .
An aliquot of the column load material and a 5-ul aliquot of each column fraction were then assayed for CCAAT-box DNA binding activity to the Ea oligomer probe using EMSA .
Equivalent film exposures were obtained for each chromatographic analysis in order to directly compare the relative level of NF-Y complex binding to ion exchange materials .
RESULTS Anion Exchange Properties of the NF-Y Complex in Stage-specific B Lymphocyte Cell Lines-NF-Y is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues , and is known to play an essential functional role in the transcriptional regulation of many tissue-specific ( MHC class II , collagen « 2 ( I ) , lipoprotein lipase ) , cell-cycle regulated ( cyclin A , ede2 ) , and inducible ( HMG-CoA , interleukin-4 ) eukaryotic genes ; however , the underlying transcriptional mechanisms that depend on NF-Y and its interaction with other combinations of general proximal-promoter factors ( eg .
Oct-1 , Spl , RFX ) , and components of the basic RNA polymerase II machinery in these diverse situations are largely unknown .
The CCAAT-box DNA binding activity of the Hela CP1 complex in Hela cells ( 26 ) , the HAP2/3 complex in S. cerevisice ( 28 ) , and the CBF complex in rat liver and NIHS3T3 cells ( 27 ) were initially shown to be lost following ion exchange chromatography , but could be reconstituted by recombining specific column fractions .
Subsequently , the CBF-A ( NF-YB ) fraction was shown to contain an additional protein component , CBF-C ( NF-YC ) , which associated with CBF-A through strong hydrophobic interactions and coeluted as a heterodimer through these ion exchange materials ( 37 ) .
Together with cloning of the HAP5 subunit ( 36 ) , these studies demonstrated that three unique subunits were minimally required for specific CCAAT-box DNA recognition .
In an effort to determine if the ubiquitous NF-Y complex exhibits differential `` tissue-specific '' biochemical properties , the ion exchange behavior of NF-Y was examined in a variety of stage-specific B lymphocyte cell lines .
The anion exchange properties of NF-Y derived from the mature murine B-cell lymphoma , A20 , were compared with the terminally differentiated murine plasmacytoma B-cell line , MPC11 ( Fig .
1 ) .
Analysis of the A20 NF-Y complex revealed near quantitative recovery of Ea CCAAT-box DNA binding activity in the 0.6 m KCl step fractions ( panel A ) .
In contrast , MPC11 NF-Y Ea DNA binding activity was virtually lost following Q* Sepharose analysis ( panel B ) .
A low level of residual MPC11 NF-Y was consistently observed in the 0.6 M KC ] step fraction ( panel !
B , fraction 10 ) .
The A20 and MPC11 Ea DNA binding activities identified in the 0.6 1 KCI step fractions were shown to be bona fide NF-Y complexes , respectively , using a-NF-YB antibodies in EMSA upshift assays . ''

Anion exchange behavior of the NF-Y complex derived from stage-specific B lymphocytes .
Nuclear extracts prepared from the murine mature B-cell lymphoma cell line , A20 ( A ) , and the murine plasmacytoma cell line , MPC11 ( B ) , were compared for NF-Y complex binding to the anion exchanger , Q* Sepharose .
The columns were developed using a KC ] step gradient , and each fraction was assayed for Ea DNA binding activity using EMSA .

S107 , MOPC 315 , and P3X63Ag8 ) using both Q* Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose .
In these cases , the mature B-cell NF-Y complex was observed to bind to Q* and DEAE-Sepharose with high affinity as an intact multimeric complex , whereas the plasma B-cell NF-Y complex separated into discrete subunit fractions .
In addition , NF-Y derived from a number of MHC class II_ cell lines ( e.g .
Hela , 3T38-L1 , and TAl ) exhibit identical Q* Sepharose binding behavior as observed in MPC11 cells . ''
These results suggest that the biochemical properties of NF-Y are altered during B-cell development , and that high affinity NF-Y Q* binding correlates with activation of MHC class II genes in mature B-cells , and loss of Q* binding correlates with suppression of class II gene transcription in terminally differentiated plasma B-cells .
In order to locate and verify the identity of NF-Y subunits separated during Q* analysis in Fig .
1 , individual complementing A20 and MPC 11 NF-Y subunits were prepared and used in recombination EMSA assays .
NF-YA and NF-YB : C fractions were added individually to A20 and MPC 11 Q* fractions , and tested for Ea DNA binding activity ( Figs .
2 and 3 ) .
Addition of exogenous A20 YB : C activity to the A20 Q* fractions identified a small quantity of additional A20 YA activity in the early region ( 0.1 m KCI ) of the step gradient ( Fig .
24 ) .
The majority of YA subunit activity however , was observed in the 0.6 m KCl step fraction .
Addition of exogenous A20 YA activity did not reveal any additional A20 YB : C activity in the A20 Q* fractions ( Fig .

These analyses suggest the majority of the A20 NF-YA and YB : C subunits elute together from Q* Sepharose as an intact multisubunit complex in the 0.6 m KCI fraction .

These results clearly demonstrate that the loss of NF-Y Ea DNA binding activity in MPC11 nuclear extracts following Q* Sepharose chromatography ( Fig .
1 ) is due to physical separation of the YA and YB : C subunits .
Furthermore , these comparisons suggest that the biochemical properties of the NF-Y complex are altered in a stage-specific manner during the transition from a mature B-cell to a plasma B-cell .
Ethidium bromide ( EtBr ) is a compound that is known to intercalate between duplex DNA strands , to prevent transcription factors from binding to their sequence-specific elements , and to be useful in assessing if associations observed between a protein and additional putative protein cofactors are specific , and not due to cofactor interaction with contaminating nuclear DNA ( 52-54 ) .
The results of testing the effectiveness of EtBr in disrupting A20 NF-Y binding to Q* Sepharose are shown in Fig .
4 .
A20 nuclear extracts were treated in control experiments with increasing EtBr concentrations , and tested for Ea DNA binding activity ( pane !
A ) .
EtBr concentrations of 50 or 100 ug/ml essentially inhibited A20 NF-Y Ea DNA binding activity ( Zanes 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
A20 nuclear extracts were made 50 ug/ml in EtBr , applied to a Q* column equilibrated in the same EtBr concentration , and KCl-step eluted ( panel !

A20 Q* column fractions were assayed for DNA-binding by first reducing the [ EtBr ] to 10 ug/ml .
A20 NF-Y was quantita-tively recovered in the 0.6 m KCl step fraction from this Q* column .

MPC11 NF-Y Q* Sepharose fractions from Fig .

increasing [ EtBr ] , as an [ EtBr ] of 50 and 100 ug/ml inhibited Ea DNA binding activity ( panel C , lanes 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
These results suggest that the A20 NF-Y complex interacts with Q* Sepharose anionic groups directly , and not through nonspecific DNA , or DNA-protein interactions .
Further support for this conclusion was reached by treating A20 nuclear extracts with high concentrations ( 0.1 unit/ul ) of micrococcal nuclease or DNase I prior to Q* column analysis .
Both treatments had no effect on A20 NF-Y binding to Q* Sepharose suggesting that contaminating DNA and/or nonspecific DNA-protein cofactor interactions are not responsible for A20 NF-Y binding to anion exchange materials . ''
High Affinity Binding of A20 NF-Y to Q* Sepharose Is Dependent on the Mature B-cell YAF Fraction-To test the concept that the NF-Y complex in mature B-cells is associated with one , or more , small molecular mass polypeptides , in comparison to the known YA ( ~42 kDa ) , YB ( ~36 kDa ) , and YC ( ~40 kDa ) subunits , a series of dialysis experiments were performed using cellulose membranes of defined molecular mass cut-off and under specific KCl concentration conditions ( Fig .
5 ) .
A20 nuclear extracts were first dialyzed against BC-420 using a 10-12-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane ( panel A ) , a 25-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane ( panel !
B ) , and against BC-100 using a 25-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane ( panel C ) , then extracts were dialyzed further against BC-100 in each case .
The A20 NF-Y complex was tested for its ability to retain or lose binding affinity for Q* Sepharose following dialysis under these experimental conditions .
These analyses suggested that , under conditions of elevated [ KCI ] and using a 25-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane , the activity associated with A20 NF-Y binding to Q* Sepharose dissociated from the NF-Y com NF-Y -associated Cofactors in Stage-specific B-cells plex and was lost during dialysis ( panel B ) .
Control experiments showed that the [ KCI ] and dialysis membrane cut-off size were critical in separating this activity away from the NF-Y complex .
In particular , lower KCI concentrations of 0.1 M were insufficient in facilitating dissociation of this activity using a 25-kDa cut-off membrane ( panel C ) .
These results suggest that the activity associated with A20 NF-Y Q* binding has a nominal molecular mass between 10 and 25 kDa , and can be physically separated from the NF-Y A : B : C subunit complex using 0.42 m KCL .
This operationally defined activity is referred to as the YAF fraction .
Subunit recombination assays using the Q* fractions in panel B and exogenous complementing YA and YB : C subunits demonstrate that the A20 YA and YB : C activities derived from dialyzed A20 extracts elute in a manner identical to MPC11 NF-Y ( Fig .
1B ) .2 Ultrafiltration has been used previously as a method for preparing active YAF fractions , and dialysis using a 25-kDa cut-off membrane under these same conditions has been used as a method to prepare nuclear extracts depleted of YAF activity ( 39 ) .
In Fig .
6 , an A20 NF-YA : B : C fraction depleted of YAF activity failed to bind to Q* Sepharose as an intact heterotrimeric complex ( panel A ) .
Recombination of the A20 YA : B : C fraction with the separated A20 YAF fraction , however , fully restored the ability of the A20 YA : B : C complex to bind to Q* Sepharose ( panel B ) .
In addition , prior treatment of the A20 YAF fraction with DNase I or micrococcal nuclease had no effect on its ability to confer Q* binding to A20 NF-YA : B : C.2 Treatment of the A20 YAF fraction with protein depleting silica beads ( StrataClean resin ) resulted in loss of its ability to restore the Q* binding phenotype ( panel C ) .
The MPC11 NF-Y subunits were shown previously to separate following Q* Sepharose analysis ( Figs .
1 and 3 ) , suggesting that NF-Y in a class II~ plasmacytoma B-cell line differs in biochemical properties from the NF-Y complex in mature B-cell class II* lymphocytes .
The ability to transfer the A20 YAF-dependent Q* phenotype to a class II_ NF-Y complex was tested by recombining MPC11 NF-Y depleted of MPC 11 YAF proteins with the isolated A20 YAF fraction , and assaying for high affinity NF-Y Q* binding ( panel D ) .
The ability to bind to Q* Sepharose was successfully transferred to MPC11 NF-YA : B : C by the A20 YAF fraction , and the MPC 11 NF-Y elution profile was identical to A20 NF-Y recombined with the A20 YAF fraction ( compare panels B and D ) .
These results further suggest that the A20 YAF fraction contains an activity capable of conferring high affinity Q* binding to NF-Y .
In addition , the partially purified A20 YA subunit derived from A20 nuclear extracts has been recombined with a partially purified Hela YB : C subunit fraction derived from this class II~ cell line , and assayed for Q* binding .
Recombination of this A20 YA fraction with Hela YB : C restores Ea DNA binding activity , but this NF-Y complex fails to bind to Q* Sepharose as an intact complex . ''
These results suggest that the ability to bind to Q* Sepharose is not contained in the A20 YA fraction , and furthermore suggests that A20 YA itself is not the activity responsible for high affinity Q* binding in the A20 NF-Y complex .
The ability to separate this activity from A20 NF-Y , and to successfully recombine the YAF fraction with the depleted A20 NF-YA : B : C complex , which itself fails to bind to Q* columns , represents a major step in efforts to characterize the functional properties of the NF-Y-associated cofactors in vitro .
Transfer of A20 YAF activity to the MPC 11 NF-Y complex suggests that loss of YAF functional activity in the NF-Y complex of terminally differentiated B-cells may represent a critical step in NF-Y modulation of MHC class II genes during B-cell development .

To test the possibility that PC4 was the YAF protein that alone conferred high affinity Q* binding to NF-Y , affinity-purified A20 NF-YA : B : C derived from YAF-depleted nuclear extracts was recombined with purified recombinant PC4 and assayed for Q* binding ( Fig .
7 ) .
PC4 was observed to specifically confer to NF-YA : B : C the ability to bind to Q* Sepharose as an intact trimeric complex with elution properties that were identical to the NF-Y complex derived from unfractionated mature B-cell nuclear extracts ( Fig .
14 ) and to NF-YA : B : C recombined with the mature B-cell YAF fraction ( Fig .
6 , B and D ) .
Recombinant PC4 was also observed to specifically stabilize the interaction of affinity-purified NF-Y binding to several known CCAAT-box elements ( Fig .
8 ) , suggesting that PC4 may stabilize NF-YA interactions with the YB : C heterodimer and as a result may stabilize overall NF-Y interactions with CCAAT-box DNA motifs .
To define the region in PC4 responsible for interaction with NF-Y , °°P-YA ( DBD ) was used to test several PC4 deletion mutants , and control GST fusion proteins , in a glutathione-agarose bead pull-down assay ( Fig .
94 ) .
YA ( DBD ) was observed to stably interact with full-length PC4 ( Zane 3 ) and with a PC4 mutant that lacks both the N-terminal serine-rich phosphorylation region and the region responsible for binding to double-stranded DNA ( Zane 7 ) .
YA ( DBD ) did not interact with a C-terminal PC4 mutant that lacked the extreme 37 amino acids ( lane 4 ) , a GST fusion protein that contained these 37 amino acids ( Zane 5 ) , or the general transcription repressor , Drl ( lane 6 ) .
These results suggest YA ( DBD ) interacts with the C-terminal region in PC4 , and maps the interaction site in PC4 near amino acid 90 .
To determine if phosphorylated PC4 retains the ability to specifically interact with NF-Y , PC4 was °°P-labeled with CKII and HMK and tested in the glutathione-agarose pull-down assay using the NF-Y complex , several NF-YA mutants , and other control GST fusion proteins ( Fig .
9B ) .
*°P-PC4 ( CKII ) , as phosphorylated by CKII , was observed to stably interact with the NF-Y complex ( Zane 3 ) , full-length YA ( Zane 4 ) , YA ( DBD ) ( Zane 6 ) , TFIIB ( lane 8 ) , and the YA ( DBD ) homolog from S. cerevisice , HAP2 ( DBD ) ( lane 9 ) .
GST-YA ( ADBD ) , which lacked the DBD element , failed to interact with *°P-PC4 ( CKII ) ( Zane 5 ) , as did GST-Drl ( Zane 7 ) .
°°P-PC4 ( HMK ) , as phosphorylated by HMK , was observed to stably interact with YA ( DBD ) ( Zane 12 ) , and a YA ( DBD ) mutant that lacked 23 amino acids in the C-terminal DBD region , YA ( DBDAC23 ) ( lane 14 ) , but failed to interact with YA ( ADBD ) that lacked the highly conserved DBD region ( Zane 13 ) .
GST-YA ( DBDAC23 ) fails to support CCAAT-box DNA binding activity when recombined with full-length NF-YB : C. '' These results suggest that internally and externally phosphorylated forms of PC4 , as modified by CKII and HMK respectively , do not impair or block interaction with YA ( DBD ) in vitro , and that the PC4 interac- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 18226 NF-Y -associated Cofactors in Stage-specific B-cells A ' C 0.3 M 0.6 M 1.0 M 0.3 M __ 0.6 M__ 1.0 M | | | NF-Y - v bolus ~ B D NF-Y - U it bs NF-Y - W bs but | | 12 13 14 15 16 17 T P OL 1 2 3 4 5 Ll M 2 13 14 1S 16 17 1 8 9 10 1 POL b 2 3 4 | ) I | 0 1 1 Fig .

These results suggest that inactivation of the B-cell-specific class II gene factor , CIITA , in BLS group II cell lines is associated with dissociation of the NF-Y subunit structure following anion exchange analysis , whereas expression of functional CIITA in both `` normal '' MHC class II* mature B-cell lines ( eg .
A20 , Raji ) , and in a BLS group III cell line , 6.1.6 , results in an NF-Y subunit structure that elutes as an intact multimeric complex from anion exchangers .
These results further suggest that CIITA may directly or indirectly modulate the activity of PC4 , in effect regulating its ability to stabilize NF-Y subunit interactions .
DISCUSSION Differential expression of MHC class II genes during B lymphocyte development represents an attractive system for studying the transcriptional mechanisms underlying tissue 18227 specific gene activation and repression .
Human MHC class II genes are activated at the mature B-cell stage ; however , progression to the plasma B-cell stage following stimulation with foreign antigens , various mitogens , and T-cell factors results in uniform repression of all class II gene expression at the transcriptional level ( 7 , 8 ) .
A number of ubiquitous transcription factors , together with the B-cell-specific cofactors , CIITA ( 6 ) and the Oct coactivator from B-cells ( 56 ) , are believed to play critical regulatory roles in stage-specific class II gene transcription ; however , the mechanistic steps involved in creating an active class II initiation complex and possible functional interactions between these general activators , B-cell-specific cofactors , and basic components of the RNA polymerase II machinery remain poorly understood .
In this study , the biochemical properties of the multimeric NF-Y complex have been investigated and compared in stage-specific B-cells in an effort to identify structural components in the NF-Y complex that may be involved in regulating NF-Y function during states of active and repressed class II tran-scription , and may contribute to the formation of a functional class II initiation complex .
The main observations from this study are as follows .
1 ) The NF-Y complex derived from MHC class II * B-cells binds to anion exchangers with high affinity as an intact trimeric species , whereas NF-Y derived from MHC class II~ plasma B-cells and BLS group II cells dissociates into discrete YA and YB : C subunit fractions .
2 ) The NF-Y complex in mature B-cells is associated with a low molecular mass protein fraction ( YAFs ) , which accounts for the NF-Y Q* binding phenotype ( i.e .
transfer of the YAF fraction to a YAF-depleted mature B-cell NF-Y complex , or a NF-YA : B : C complex derived from class II~ cells fully restores NF-Y Q* binding .
3 ) Recombinant PC4 restores high affinity NF-YA : B : C binding to Q* Sepharose , and significantly stabilizes native NF-Y : CCAAT-box DNA interactions in vitro .
Anion exchange analysis of the NF-Y complex in a variety of human and murine MHC class II* mature B-cell lines have shown NF-Y to elute as an intact trimeric complex ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
Western blot analyses of the A20 Q* fractions shown in Fig .
1 , using affinity-purified a-YA and « -YB antibodies , also confirmed that the YA and YB subunits coelute in the 0.6 M KCl fraction . ''
In contrast , the NF-Y complex derived from a variety of murine class II~ plasma B-cell lines , several other class II~ cell types ( e.g .
P388D1 , 3T3-L1 , TA1 , C3H10T1/2 ) , and shown previously in Hela ( 26 ) , and NIH 3T3 ( 27 ) cell lines , dissociates into discrete YA and YB : C subunit fractions following Q* analysis .
These observations together with NF-Y subunit recombination experiments ( Fig .
2 ) suggest NF-YA : B : C subunit interactions are stabilized in class II* mature B-cells , in comparison to a variety of class II~ cell types .
To test these conclusions further , the anion exchange properties of NF-Y were examined in the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line , P388D1 , during IFN-y-mediated dif-ferentiation .
In the absence of IFN-y , NF-Y dissociated into YA and YB : C fractions , whereas NF-Y eluted as the trimeric complex following IFN-y-mediated induction of class II transcription . ''
These comparisons suggest that the anion exchange properties of NF-Y are significantly altered during periods of active , inactive , or repressed MHC class II transcription .
In a previous report , physical interaction between NF-Y and the transcriptional coactivator , PC4 , was demonstrated in vitro using far Western assays , and mapped to the highly conserved DBD element in the NF-YA subunit ( 39 ) .
Biochemical characterization of the YAF fraction from a variety of cell types and these initial studies raised the possibility that PC4 was associated with NF-Y in stage-specific B-cells , and responsible for the NF-Y Q* binding properties .

sion of NF-Y into a complex that bound Q* Sepharose in a manner indistinguishable from mature B-cell NF-Y , and NF-Y reconstituted with the mature B-cell YAF fraction ( Fig .
7 ) .
These results suggest that PC4 is the YAF component , which itself is necessary and sufficient for conferring the Q+ binding phenotype to the NF-YA : B : C complex .
PC4 is known to be phosphorylated in a group of N-terminal serine residues , primarily by CKII in vivo , and this modification of has been shown .
to prevent its interaction with the viral activator , VP16 , and its ability to function as a coactivator in vitro ( 48 ) .
The PC4 recombination results suggest that the non-phosphorylated form of PC4 is capable of conferring the high affinity Q* binding phenotype to NF-Y , and further suggest that PC4 may be differentially regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in association with NF-Y .
To determine if phosphorylated forms of PC4 interact with NF-Y , PC4 was phosphorylated both with CKII and HMK and used to probe a series of GST fusion proteins in a solution pull-down assay ( Fig .
9 ) .
Both °°P-PC4 modified forms bound to YA ( DBD ) , and not to the N-terminal activation domain of YA , suggesting that phosphorylation did not impair this interaction , and that the general nature of this association was different from previous studies suggesting an interaction between the N-terminal region of PC4 and the activation domains of VP16 ( 48 ) , and GAL4-AH ( 57 ) .
Of particular note was the observation that °°P-PC4 interacted with the subunit interaction subdomain of YA ( DBD ) .
This region in YA ( DBD ) is known to be important for the interaction of YA with the YB : C heterodimer in creation of a unique structure , which then recognizes the CCAAT-box motif ( 32 ) .
Deletion of amino acids in the DNA-binding subdomain of YA ( DBD ) , which prevent interaction with CCAAT-box motifs , did not impair interaction with PC4 .
In addition , recombinant PC4 was observed to specifically stabilize NF-Y : CCAAT- box DNA interactions in vitro ( Fig .
8 ) .
These results further suggest that the interaction of PC4 with YA ( DBD ) may play a significant role in stabilizing YA interaction with YB : C , and the interaction with CCAAT-box binding sites following subunit trimerization .
Further studies will be aimed at determining the step ( s ) at which PC4 functions in these processes , and in more precisely defining the region and amino acids in YA ( DBD ) that support this interaction .
To more accurately define the region in PC4 that interacts with YA ( DBD ) , a series of GST-PC4 mutants were tested in vitro ( Fig .
9 ) .
The N-terminal CKII phosphorylation region in PC4 was clearly dispensable for this interaction , while the C terminus near amino acid 90 appeared to be an important interaction site .
Phosphorylation of PC4 by CKII has been suggested to induce a conformational change that prevents its interaction with activation regions and nullifies its positive coactivator functions ( 45 ) .
Interaction of PC4 through its C-terminal region with the highly conserved YA ( DBD ) region suggests PC4 may function in a unique manner when bound to NF-Y , since this interaction was mapped to the region known at present only to be responsible for nonspecific binding to single-strand DNA ( 57 , 58 ) .
In association with NF-Y , PC4 may act both as a potent activator through its N-terminal region , and as a repressor when phosphorylated by CKII since both forms interact with YA ( DBD ) .
In addition , PC4 may regulate NF-Y CCAAT-box DNA binding by stabilizing overall subunit interactions , which in turn increase the rate of NF-Y association with its DNA-binding site .
An interaction between °°P-PCA4 ( CKIIT ) and TFIIB was also observed ( Fig .
9 ) ; however , the functional significance of this observation is not known at present .
These results contrast with previous studies which suggest non-phosphorylated human PC4 interacts with TFIIA , and not TFIIB , in vitro ( 59 ) , and with Far Western assays , which suggest non-phosphorylated SUB1 , the yeast homolog of PC4 , interacts with TFIIB , and acts as a clearance factor in vivo by promoting the release of TFIIB from TBP ( 60 ) .
SUB1L has been shown to activate a upstream activating sequence reporter ~4-fold in yeast which contains a CCAAT-box DNA-binding site for HAP2/3/4/5 , the yeast homolog of NF-Y ( 60 ) .
These results suggest PC4 may also play a functional role in mediating NF-Y transactivation potential in vivo , and warrant further investigation into the functional relationships between NF-Y , PC4 , TFIIA , TFIIB , TBP , and their concerted mecha- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog NF-Y -associated Cofactors in Stage-specific B-cells nism of action within NF-Y CCAAT-box containing promoters .
Characterization of MHC class II gene expression during the mature to plasma B-cell transition , and in somatic plasma : mature B-cell hybrids , has suggested that the shift from active to inactive class II transcription involves expression of a dominant plasma B-cell repressor ( 7 , 8 ) .
Overexpression of CIITA in plasma cells overrides this repression and restores class II transcription ( 43 ) , suggesting that the hypothesized plasma B-cell repressor may act not on class II promoters directly , but possibly on the CIITA promoter itself to extinguish CIITA expression .
These comparative analyses between stage-specific B-cells demonstrate that CIITA plays a dominant role in class II transcription ; however , the relationships between CIITA expression , class II promoter structure , and additional coactivator proteins in relation to tissue-specific transcriptional initiation remain unclear .
CIITA functions as a critical nodal point in class II gene activation , and transmission of its signal either directly , or through downstream effector proteins , could result in specific alterations in the structure and activity of the known class II transcription factors during B-cell development .
Several BLS group II cell lines which possess defective CIITA genes , RJ2.2.5 and RM3 , and are class II_ , as well all other class II~ non-B-cell tested here , exhibit the class II~ NF-Y Q* phenotype .
In contrast , the parental cell line , Raji , and all other mature B-cell lines that express CIITA , exhibit the class II* NF-Y Q* phenotype .
The CIITA* BLS group III cell line , 6.1.6 , also exhibits the mature B-cell NF-Y Q* phenotype despite absence of class II transcription .
Collectively these comparative analyses from a diverse set of cell types and cellular states provide support for the suggestion that PC4 activation is linked to CIITA expression .
Transmission of the biochemical signal initiated by CIITA may lead to conversion of PC4 from the phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated form , and stabilization of NF-Y subunit interactions .
The accumulated evidence presented in this study supports a model of NF-Y structure based on a unique association with the abundant , ubiquitously expressed cofactor , PC4 .
In this context , PC4 may be involved in mediating general NF-Y transcription factor functions in class II~ cells , and undergo post-translational modification both during B-cell development and during IFN-y-induced class II gene activation , which are critical to NF-Y function in MHC class II gene transcription .
Terminal differentiation into the plasma B-cell stage may signal specific PC4 phosphorylation events , and be coupled to the overall process of extinguishing class II transcription .
Further in vitro analyses of the biochemical nature of the NF-Y complex in stage-specific B lymphocytes and its in vivo function will aid elucidation of the molecular mechanisms linking NF-Y function with PC4 activity , and may provide insight into the signals initiated by CIITA which regulate tissue-specific MHC class II gene transcription .
