10 PU.1 ( Spi-1 ) and C/EBPa Regulate Expression of the Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor « Gene STEFAN HOHAUS , MARTHA S. PETROVICK , MARIA TERESA VOSO , ZIJIE SUN , DONG-ER ZHANG , anp DANIEL G. TENEN®* Division of Hematology/Oncology , Department of Medicine , Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Received 31 January 1995/Returned for modification 29 April 1995/Accepted 12 July 1995 Growth factor receptors play an important role in hematopoiesis .
In order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of hematopoiesis , we initiated a study investigating the transcription factors activating the expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) receptor « gene .
Here , we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF receptor « promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion in myelomonocytic cells , which correlates with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse transcription PCR .
The GM-CSF receptor « promoter contains an important functional site between positions -53 and -41 as identified by deletion analysis of reporter constructs .
We show that the myeloid and B cell transcription factor PU.1 binds specifically to this site .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that a CCAAT site located upstream of the PU.1 site between positions -70 and -54 is involved in positive-negative regulation of the GM-CSF receptor a promoter activity .
C/EBPa is the major CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of U937 cells .
Point mutations of either the PU.1 site or the C/EBP site that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of GM-CSF receptor « promoter activity in myelomonocytic cells only .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that in myeloid and B cell extracts , PU.1 forms a novel , specific , more slowly migrating complex ( PU-SF ) when binding the GM-CSF receptor « promoter PU.1 site .
This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with PU.1 on a myeloid PU.1 binding site .
The novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to B cell enhancer sites and can be formed by addition of PU.1 to extracts from certain nonmyeloid cell types which do not express PU.1 , including T cells and epithelial cells , but not from erythroid cells .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that the PU-SF complex binds to PU.1 sites found on a number of myeloid promoters , and its formation requires an intact PU.1 site adjacent to a single-stranded region .
Expression of PU.1 in nonmyeloid cells can activate the GM-CSF receptor « promoter .
Deletion of the amino-terminal region of PU.1 results in a failure to form the PU-SF complex and in a concomitant loss of transactivation , suggesting that formation of the PU-SF complex is of functional importance for the activity of the GM-CSF receptor « promoter .
Finally , we demonstrate that C/EBPa can also activate the GM-CSF receptor « promoter in nonmyeloid cells .
These results suggest that PU.1 and C/EBPa direct the cell-type-specific expression of GM-CSF receptor a , further establish the role of PU.1 as a key regulator of hematopoiesis , and point to C/EBPa as an additional important factor in this process .
Hematopoietic growth factors and their receptors play an important role in the proliferation , differentiation , and survival of hematopoietic cells .
Among these factors , functional and binding analyses suggest that the receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is expressed specifically on myeloid cells and their precursors ( 8 , 42 , 43 , 68 ) .
In myeloid cells , the GM-CSF receptor is expressed on early myeloid cells as well as on mature phagocytic cells , reflecting the ability of GM-CSF to modulate the development and activity of myeloid cells throughout differentiation ( 21 , 50 , 68 ) .
The heterodimeric GM-CSF receptor consists of at least two subunits , an « chain , which binds GM-CSF with low affinity when expressed alone , and a nonbinding B chain , which is required for the formation of high-affinity receptors and signal transduction and is shared by two other cytokine receptors , the interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) and IL-5 receptors ( 32 ) .
Functional GM-CSF receptors have been identified on primary and cultured myeloblasts from patients with acute leukemia and on neutro- * Corresponding author .

5830 phils and basophils from patients with juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia ( 12 , 43 ) .
An increased responsiveness to GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of juvenile chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( 12 ) .
However , the differential expression of the « and B subunits , their tissue specificity , and their developmental regulation on both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells remain poorly understood .
Recently , the gene for the « subunit of the human GM-CSF receptor has been cloned , and its genomic structure , including the putative promoter region , has been described ( 35 ) .
The major transcription initiation site in hematopoietic cells was determined to be 195 bp upstream of the translation initiation site ( 35 ) .
As with many other genes which are regulated during myeloid cell differentiation , the sequence of the 5'-flanking region does not contain an obvious TATA motif ( 35 ) .
Interestingly , several purine-rich stretches , resembling PU.1 binding sites , were identified in the proximal 5 ' upstream region .
PU.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors and is specifically expressed in myeloid and B cells ( 6 , 24 ) .
PU.1 was first identified as the product of the Spi-1 oncogene in Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia ( 16 , 33 , 44 ) , and over-expression of PU.1 in erythroid progenitor cells can block erythroblast differentiation ( 55 ) .
Recently , many target genes Vou .

Schematic representation of the GM-CSF receptor a promoter , PU.1 and C/EBP « binding sites , and deletion mutants .
The DNA sequence is taken from reference 35 .
The position of the transcription start site is numbered +1 ( 35 ) .
The purine-rich region ( bp -39 to -27 ) common to several myeloid promoters is circled ( 35 ) .
A GA-rich sequence ( bp -5 to +1 ) , which does not bind PU.1 , and the actual PU.1 binding site identified by gel shift assay ( bp -48 to -43 ) are boxed .
The guanosine residues at bp -48 , -46 , and -45 which contact PU.1 as identified by methylation interference are indicated by asterisks .
The CCAAT box at bp -63 to -59 is overlined .
The construct -393GM-CSFr-luc contains the sequence from residue -393 to +49 cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pXP2 .
The 5 ' positions of the deletion constructs are indicated by numbers above the sequence .
The first intron , which starts after bp +81 , is indicated by lowercase letters .
for the transcriptional regulation by PU.1 have been identified in myeloid cells ( 1 , 10 , 13 , 25 , 29 , 34 , 41 , 45 , 52 , 62 , 70 ) .
Among these is the receptor for M-CSF ( 70 ) , which has a PU.1 site at nearly the identical position with respect to the transcription initiation site as a putative PU.1 site in the GM-CSF receptor a promoter .
PU.1 has a crucial role for hematopoietic devel-opment , as shown by the inhibition of colony formation of human CD34¢* cells by PU.1 binding double-stranded oligonucleotides ( 66 ) .
Furthermore , gene targeting of PU.1 in mice results in a complete abrogation of fetal development of myeloid cells and lymphocytes ( 56 ) .
The PU.1 protein consists of 272 amino acids , with the DNA binding domain located in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein , while the amino terminus contains an activation do-main , which has been implicated in interactions with other regulatory proteins ( 19 , 24 ) .
In B cells , PU.1 recruits a second , B cell-specific DNA binding factor , NF-EMS5 , to a site important for immunoglobulin k 3 ' enhancer function ( 11 , 46 , 47 ) .
For this interaction , phosphorylation of a serine residue at position 148 is necessary ( 47 ) .
However , such interactions have not been shown to play a functional role in previously described myeloid targets of PU.1 , such as CD11b and the M-CSF receptor ( 41 , 70 ) .
In vitro experiments also demonstrated an interaction of the amino-terminal region of PU.1 with a conserved region in both the basal transcription factor TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) and the retinoblastoma ( RB ) protein ( 19 ) , and in these TATA box-lacking , myeloid promoters , the PU.1 site could function like a TATA box to recruit the basal transcription factors to the promoters ( 10 , 19 ) .
Upstream of the potential PU.1 sites in the 5'-flanking region of GM-CSF receptor a are sequences representing potential binding sites for CCAAT-binding proteins .
Members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) family of transcription factors have been shown to regulate the terminal differentiation of adipocytes and hepatocytes ( 5 , 28 ) .
In the hematopoietic system , C/EBPa , C/EBPRB , and C/EBP3 are specifically expressed in myeloid , but not in erythroid or lymphoid cells and are differentially expressed during myelomonocytic differentiation ( 18 , 22 , 36 , 57 , 64 ) .
High levels of expression of C/EBPa in proliferating myeloid cells ( 36 , 57 ) suggest that C/EBPa may activate genes involved in the growth and differentiation of these cells .
Currently , few target genes for the regulatory function of C/EBP have been definitely identified in myeloid cells .
In chicken cells , the C/EBP factor NF-M regulates the expression of the mim-1 gene ( 4 , 37 ) and of chicken myelomonocytic growth factor , a homolog of human G-CSF ( 18 , 22 , 64 ) .
The promoter of the human neutrophil elastase gene contains a functional site which resembles a C/EBP site ( 39 ) .
Moreover , the promoter regions of the genes for several cytokines which are expressed in macrophages , including human G-CSF , IL-6 , IL-1a , IL-1B , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , contain known or predicted C/EBP binding sites ( 3 , 36 , 48 ) .
Potential binding sites in the 5 ' -flanking region of an impor- 5832 HOHAUS ET AL .
tant myeloid growth factor receptor , GM-CSF receptor « , prompted us to investigate whether PU.1 and/or C/EBP play important roles in the transcriptional activation of this key regulator of hematopoietic development .
Here we demonstrate that both PU.1 and C/EBP bind to sites critical for myeloid cell-specific expression of the GM-CSF receptor a promoter .
Moreover , PU.1 forms a larger complex with another protein which may be important for functional activ- ity .

RT-PCR analysis of GM-CSF receptor « gene expression .
Total RNA was isolated from cell lines by the guanidium isothiocyanate-CsCl method ( 53 ) .
First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 30 ng of total RNA , using 200 U of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a 20-pl reaction mixture containing 1 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates ( dNTPs ) , 1 U of RNasin per pl , 100 pmol of random hexamers ( Pharmacia ) , and 10 mM dithiothreitol in 1 % buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl [ pH 8.3 ] , 75 mM KCl , 6 mM MgCl ; ) .
The reaction mixture was incubated at 23°C for 10 min , 42°C for 60 min , and 94°C for 5 min .
PCR was performed in a reaction volume containing 2 pl of the reverse transcription ( RT ) product , 40 pmol of each primer , 200 M dNTPs , and 2 U of Taq polymerase in 1 % buffer ( 10 mM Tris HCl [ pH 8.3 ] , 50 mM KCI , 1.5 mM MgC ) , 0.001 % gelatin ) .
Each cycle of PCR included 1 min of denaturation at 94°C , 1 min of annealing at 60°C for the GM-CSF receptor « primers ( 5'-C TTCTCTCTGACCAGCA-3 ' and 5 '' -ACATGGGTTCCTGAGTC-3 ' ) ( 15 ) or at 50°C for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) primers ( 5'-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3 ' and 5°CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3 ' ) ( 2 ) , and 90 s of extension at 72°C .
A control for DNA contamination , containing water instead of cDNA , was used in each RT-PCR .
To ensure that the RT-PCR signal was linear with respect to the RNA input , we performed a kinctic analysis by varying the number of cycles of amplification for each primer set and the amount of RNA input ( 66 ) .
On the basis of this analysis , we used 20 cycles for the GAPDH primers and 27 cycles for the GM-CSF receptor primers .
RT-PCR products were separated on a 1.5 % agarose gel and blotted on a Biotrans+ membrane ( ICN ) in 0.4 M NaOH .
The blots were dried , prehybridized , and hybridized in 0.5 M NaPO , ( pH 7.2 ) -7 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -1 % bovine serum albumin at 65°C with GM-CSF receptor a cDNA and GAPDH cDNA as probes .
The membranes were washed in 2 SSC ( 2 % SSC is 0.15 NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate ) -0.1 % SDS at room temperature for 5 min , and in 0.2 SSC-0.1 % SDS at 65°C for 10 min .
Exposures were performed in the linear range at -80°C with an intensifying screen .
Isolation of the human GM-CSF receptor « promoter , The sequence 5 ' of exon 1 of the human GM-CSF receptor a gene was amplified and cloned from Beilll-digested human genomic DNA ( peripheral blood of a normal donor ) by PCR based on the published sequence ( 35 ) with primer A ( 5-GTGGGATCCTG CAGGAAAGTGGGGAT-3 ' ) and primer B ( 5 % -GTGGATCCGGTACGCTIT CTCTCCT-3 ' ) .
The synthesized fragment was 466 bp long , extending from bp -393 to +73 with the transcription start site designated +1 ( Fig .
1 ) ( 35 ) .
A second PCR fragment from bp - 393 to +49 was generated by using primer A and primer C ( 5-/GTGGTACCGCITTITTCTTCTCTCGGA-3 ' ) and the 466-bp-con-taining plasmid as a template .
This PCR fragment was digested with BemHI and KpnI and cloned into the promoterless luciferase vector pXP2 ( 38 ) .
The sequence of this fragment matched the published genomic sequence .
This construct is referred to as -393GM-CSFr-luc .
Transient transfections .
U937 , Raji , and Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation in IMDM medium ( GIBCO ) at 960 F and 300 V , and Rex cells were transfected at 280 V , with a Bio-Rad Genepulser .
The cells were harvested 7 h posttransfection into 0.25 ml of lysis buffer , and 0.1 ml of this lysate was added to 0.3 ml of assay buffer for luciferase assays .
The details of the transfection and luciferase assay procedures were as described previously ( 40 ) .
The transfection efficiency was normalized to the levels of growth hormone produced by 2 ug of cotransfected plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus promoter directing human growth hormone gene expression ( CMV-hGH ) .

( 7 ) , modified as described previously ( 41 ) , with the addition of 1 mM diisopropylfluorophosphate ( Sigma ) to buffers A and C. Extracts of Cos ?
and HepG2 cells were prepared by the following method .
Adherent cells ( 10° to 10 '' cells per 100-mm-diameter tissue culture plate ) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ( Sigma ) , scraped from the plate , pelleted by centrifugation at 200 x g , resuspended in 1 ml of PBS , and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes .
The cells were pelleted again and resuspended in 400 pl of cold hypotonic buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES [ N-2-hydroxyeth-ylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ] [ pH 7.9 ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KC , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride ) , and allowed to swell for 15 min on ice .
The cells were lysed by being vortexed for 10 s , and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 10 s in a microcentrifuge .
The supernatant was removed , and the nuclei were resuspended in 40 pl of cold buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 25 % glycerol , 420 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) and incubated on ice for 20 min , with flicking of the tube several times .
The nuclei were pelleted at 4°C and 12,000 x g for 3 min , and the supernatant was removed and stored at -80°C .

Identification of critical cis elements in the GM-CSF receptor « promoter .
A series of 5 ' deletion constructs was generated and transiently transfected into U937 cells .
Four to eight independent experiments were performed , and the average fold luciferase activity over the level with pXP2 and standard errors were calculated .
Luciferase activity was normalized to growth hormone produced by a cotransfected CMV-hGH plasmid .
bility shift assay ( EMSA ) were prepared as previously described ( 41 ) , and 0.5 ng ( specific activity , 5 X 10° cpm/ug ) was used per reaction .

As described in the figure legends , unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides ( 50 ng = 100-fold excess ) were included in this 30-min preincubation .
For supershift experiments , 1 pl of either specific polyclonal antiserum or normal rabbit serum was added to the preincubation mixture .
A rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing the amino terminus of PU.1 ( amino acids 33 to 45 of the murine protein ) was provided by Richard Maki ( 24 , 46 ) , and an antiserum raised against the full-length PU.1 protein was a gift from David Kabat .
Rabbit antisera raised against the carboxyl four-fifths of C/EBP « , against the carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acids of C/EBPB , and against full-length C/EBP3 were provided by Steven McKnight .
An Oct-1 peptide antiserum ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) served as a control .
Antiserum raised against the full-length RB protein ( N9 serum ) and preimmune serum were provided by Bill Kaelin .
In vitro transcription and translation of PU.1 , PU.1 deletion mutants , and other ets family members were performed with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system ( TnT system ; Promega ) as previously described ( 66 ) , and 1 pl was added in the 20 pl reaction mixture instead of adding the nuclear extract .
Reaction mixtures were then electrophoresed at 10 V/cm on a 5.2 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 % TBE ( 45 mM Tris-borate , 1 mM EDTA ) at 4°C .
Methylation interference analysis .
Twenty-five picomoles of an oligonucleotide spanning bp -70 to -54 ( Fig .

After heat inactivation at 65°C for 20 min , PCR was performed by adding 25 pmol of primer C , 2 ng of -393GM-CSFr-lue as the template , and KCI and dNTPs to final concentrations of 50 mM and 50 pM , respectively , in a total volume of 100 fJ .
The amplification procedure included denaturation at 94°C for 1 min , annealing at 55°C for 1 min , and extension at 72°C for 1 min during 35 PCR cycles .
The PCR product was then isolated after electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose gel .
The PCR fragment was partially methylated by treatment with dimethyl sulfate as previously described ( 30 , 63 , 70 ) , subjected to a binding reaction which was scaled up fivefold from the EMSA conditions described above , and incubated on ice for 20 min .
The samples were then electrophoresed on low-ionic-strength 4 % polyacrylamide gels .
The complexes in the free and bound fractions were visualized by autoradiography , excised from the gel , and isolated by electroclution .
Each sample was extracted twice with phenol-chloro-form and once with chloroform and ethanol precipitated .
The pellet was resuspended in 150 pl of 1 M piperidine and incubated at 90°C for 30 min .
Piperidine was removed by butanol precipitation and drying in a speed vacuum apparatus .
Samples with equivalent amounts of radioactivity were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8 % polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel and visualized by auto-radiography .
Construction of plasmids with deletions , with site-directed mutations , and with the PU.1 binding site upstream of the thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter .
Deletion constructs of the GM-CSF receptor « promoter were generated by PCR with -393GM-CSFr-luc as the template with primer C ( described above ) and the respective 5'-3 ' primers containing a 5 ' BemHI site as indicated in Fig .
1 .
The PCR product was digested with BermHI and KpnI and ligated into BamHI-KpnT-digested luciferase vector pXP2 ( 38 ) .
Mutated GM-CSF receptor « promoter fragments were also generated by PCR ( 26 ) .
For generation of -53GM-CSFr ( GM-1 ) -luc , containing mutations in the PU.1 site at positions -48 , -46 , and -45 , the plasmid -393GM-CSFr-luc served as the template and primer C and were used as primers ( mu-tated bases are shown in lowercase ) .
For construction of -70GM-CSFr ( GM-1 ) -luc , the resulting PCR fragment then served as a primer for the second PCR , using this fragment and 5'-AGGTITCCCAATCCTAT-3 ' as primers and -393GM-CSFr-lue as the template .
The plasmid -70GM-CSFr ( GM-2 ) -luc , containing mutations in the CCAAT site at positions -60 and -61 , was generated by PCR with primer C and 5 '' -AGGTITTCCCg @ gTCCTAT-3 ' with -393GM-CSFr-luc as the template .
To generate the double PU.1-C/EBP mutant -70GM-CS-Fr ( GM-1/2 ) , -70GM-CSFr ( GM-1 ) -lue was used instead as the template .
The final PCR products were digested with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into BamHI-Kpnl-digested pXP2 .
The plasmids PU.1-T81-lue and mutPU.1-T81-lue were constructed from oligonucleotides with wild-type and GM1 mutant sequences , respectively , from positions -53 to -36 , with XhoI and Sell restriction sites ( 5'-tegagGAAATGAGGAAGCAGGGGg-3 ' and 5'-tegacCCCCTGCTTCCT CATITCe-3 ' , 5'-tegagGAAATcAccAAGCAGGGGg-3 ' and 5'-tegacCCCCT GCTTegTgATITCce-3 ' ) .
These were cloned into the Sal site of pBluescript KS ( - ) ( Strategene ) .
A single wild-type PU.1 site was subcloned into the BarHI-Sall site of pT81-luc , and a single PU.1 mutant GM1 sequence was subcloned into the HindIIM-SsfI site of pT81-luc ( 38 ) .
The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method .
Transactivation .
HepG2 and CV-1 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as previously described ( 14 ) with 10 ug of reporter plasmid ; with expression vectors containing full-length PU.1 ( 24 ) , amino-terminally deleted forms of the PU.1 protein ( N133 PU.1 or N70 PU.1 ) ( 59 ) , or the C/EBP expression vector MSV-C/EBPa ( 5 ) ; and with 0.25 ug of CMV-hGH plasmid and sonicated double-stranded salmon sperm DNA , to a total of 20 ug of DNA .
Luciferase assays were performed 40 h after transfection .
Titration of expression vectors over the range of 1 to 8 pg did not produce any significant difference in results .
RESULTS GM-CSF receptor a is specifically expressed in myelomonocytic cell lines .
The expression of the GM-CSF receptor a chain and its regulation during hematopoietic differentiation have not been extensively characterized .
As a basis for the subsequent comparative analysis of the cell-type-specific activity of the 5 ' -flanking region , we determined the mRNA expression of GM-CSF receptor « in the hematopoietic system .
We analyzed several myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines .

A double-stranded GM-CSF receptor a promoter oligonucleotide extending from position -53 to -37 was end labeled with [ y- > °P ] ATP and incubated with 2 ug of double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) in the absence of nuclear protein ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of 1 pl of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate ( lane 2 ) , 1 pl of reticulocyte lysate containing in vitro-translated PU.1 ( lanes 3 through 7 ) , or 10 pg of nuclear protein prepared from U937 cells ( lanes 8 through 11 ) .
The following unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added at a 100-fold molar excess over the probe oligonu-cleotide : GM-CSF receptor a bp -53 to -37 ( self [ S ] ) ( lanes 4 and 9 ) and GM-CSF receptor a mutated PU.1 site oligonucleotide ( GM1 ) ( lanes 5 and 10 ) .
In lanes 7 and 11 , antiserum recognizing the amino terminus of PU.1 was added to the reaction mixture as described in Materials and Methods ; in lane 6 , normal rabbit serum ( NRS ) was added as a control .

The sequence of the GM1 mutated PU.1 site oligonucleotide is shown in Fig .
9. tained only a very weak signal with Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis .
Therefore , we applied the sensitive technique of RT-PCR for analysis of expression .
Primers were chosen to detect mRNA independent of alternative splicing ( 49 ) .
As a control , we compared the relative expression of the housekeeping GAPDH gene .
GM-CSF receptor a was expressed in the myeloid cell lines U937 , HL-60 , Monomac , and NB4 and also in monocytes isolated from peripheral blood but not in the B-lymphoblastic cell line Raji or the T-lymphoblastic cell lines REX and Jurkat ( Fig .
2A ) .
These data confirm the myeloid cell-specific expression of the GM-CSF receptor « mRNA in the hematopoietic system .
The promoter of GM-CSF receptor « exhibits cell-type-specific activity .
To analyze whether the promoter exhibits myeloid cell-specific activity , a DNA fragment spanning from bp -393 to +49 of the human GM-CSF receptor a gene ( Fig .
1 ) was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pXP2 to form -393GM-CSFr-luc .
Promoter activity was determined by the luciferase assay after transfection into the human myelomonocytic cell line U937 and compared with the activity of transfected nonmyeloid cell lines , including the B-lymphoblastoid Raji and BJAB and T-lymphoblastoid Rex and Jurkat cell lines ( Fig .
2B ) .
All luciferase values were corrected for transfection efficiency by cotransfection of CMV-hGH and compared with those for the promoterless vector pXP2 .
In the myelomonocytic cell line , the GM-CSF receptor « 5 ' -flanking region demonstrated very strong activity .
The luciferase activity of -393GM-CSFr-lue was 303-fold ( mean ) greater than that of Mor .

pXP2 .
Comparative analysis revealed that this promoter is five-to eight-fold more active than in the nonmyeloid cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
These results demonstrate that the 5'-flanking region of the GM-CSF receptor « contains cell-type-specific activity .
The GM-CSF receptor « promoter contains an important functional site between bp -53 and -41 .
To localize the functionally important sites for the promoter activity in myeloid cells , we performed a deletion analysis of the 5 -flanking region of the GM-CSF receptor a gene .
We created a series of deletions of the -flanking region ( Fig .
1 and 3 ) , and the activities of the 5 ' deletion series with endpoints at bp -278 , -146 , -70 , -53 , -41 , and -10 were assessed in U937 cells by transient transfections ( Fig .
3 ) .
Deletion to position -70 was of no significant consequence .
Deletion to position -53 resulted in an increase of activity ( mean , 2.3-fold ) .
Additional deletion to position -41 , which removed a potential PU.1 binding site , diminished the GM-CSF receptor a promoter activity from 668-fold above that for pXP2 to 88-fold , an 87 % drop in activity .
Further deletion to position -10 did not change the basal activity of the promoter .
PU.1 binds to the GM-CSF receptor « promoter region .
The functionally important region between bp -53 and -41 contains a purine-rich sequence resembling sites known to bind PU.1 in myeloid cells ( Fig .
1 ) ( 35 ) .
PU.1 is a myeloid and B cell-specific transcription factor which has been implicated in the transcriptional control of several myeloid cell-specific genes , including another receptor for a myeloid growth factor , the M-CSF receptor ( 70 ) .
Therefore , an oligonucleotide spanning the region from bp -53 to -37 was prepared and used in EMSA with either in vitro-translated PU.1 or nuclear extracts from U937 cells .
As shown in Fig .
4 , in vitro-translated PU.1 protein comigrates with a complex ( labeled PU.1 ) formed with nuclear extracts from U937 cells .
This complex can be inhibited by the wild-type PU.1 site ( Fig .
4 , lanes 4 and 9 ) , but not by a mutant PU.1 site ( Fig .
4 , lanes 5 and 10 ; see also Fig .
5 , lane 1 ) .
The complex can be supershifted by using a specific amino-terminal peptide antibody ( Fig .
4 , lanes 7 and 11 ) .
In vitro-translated Spi-B , a member of the ets family of transcription factors closely related to PU.1 ( 51 ) , can also bind to this PU.1 site ( data not shown ) .
However , other ets family mem-bers , including ets-1 , ets-2 , elf-1 , and fli-1 , failed to interact with this site ( data not shown ) .
In addition to the complex designated PU.1 in Fig .
4 , faster-and more slowly migrating specific complexes can be observed in nuclear extracts of U937 cells .
The faster-migrating band , indicated in Fig .
4 with an asterisk , has been observed previously in EMSA with probes containing PU.1 sites in the CD11b and the M-CSF receptor promoters and has been described extensively ( 6 , 41 , 70 ) .
This complex is formed by a proteolytic product of PU.1 which retains the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain but has lost the amino-terminal region recognized by the peptide antiserum .
The more slowly migrating complex ( PU-SF ) can be diminished by both an antiserum raised against an amino-terminal PU.1 peptide ( 24 , 46 ) and an antibody raised against the full-length PU.1 protein ( 54 ) , indicating that PU.1 is involved in the interaction with another protein , which we refer to as PU.1-shifting factor , in the formation of this complex , PU-SF ( Fig .
4 , lane 11 ; Fig .
5 , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
Furthermore , unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the PU.1 binding sites from the promoters of the CD11b and the M-CSF receptor genes inhibit the more slowly migrating complex , PU-SF , supporting the notion that it contains PU.1 ( Fig .
5 , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
While these functional PU.1 sites can compete for the formation of this complex , a purine-rich potential PU.1 site ( 35 ) from the GM-CSF receptor promoter ( positions -10 to +7 ; Fig .
1 ) fails to compete ( Fig .
5 , lane 5 ) , Vou .

Characterization of the PU-SF complex by gel mobility shift assay .
The GM-CSF receptor « promoter oligonucleotide from position -53 to -37 ( same as for Fig .
4 ) was used as a probe and incubated with 10 jg of nuclear extract prepared from either U937 cells ( lanes 1 through 12 ) , Raji B cells ( lanes 13 through 15 ) , or Jurkat T cells ( lanes 16 and 17 ) .
The following unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixtures at a 100-fold molar excess : GM-CSF receptor a promoter bp -53 to -37 ( self ) ( lanes 14 and 17 ) , mutated PU.1 site ( GM1 ) GM-CSF receptor a promoter ( lanes 1 and 15 ) , PU.1 binding site from the CD11b promoter ( 41 ) ( lane 2 ) , mutated PU.1 site from the CD11b promoter ( M1 mutation [ 41 ] ) ( lane 3 ) , M-CSF receptor ( c-fins ) promoter PU.1 binding site ( 70 ) ( lane 4 ) , GM-CSF receptor a promoter bp -10 to +7 ( lane 5 ) , GM-CSF receptor « promoter bp -41 to -25 ( lane 6 ) , and GM-CSF receptor a promoter bp -80 to -49 ( lane 7 ) .
The following antisera were added as described in Materials and Methods : antiserum recognizing the amino terminus of PU.1 ( lane 9 ) , antiserum against the full-length PU.1 protein ( lane 10 ) , antiserum against Oct-1 ( lane 11 ) , antiserum raised against Sp1 ( lane 12 ) , and normal rabbit serum ( lane 8 ) .
Abbreviations are as in Fig .
4 ; in addition , a nonspecific band observed near the top of the gel is labeled NS .
The autoradiograph was extensively exposed in order to show the PU-SF complex in U937 cells .
indicating that it does not bind PU.1 .
Moreover , oligonucleotides spanning the regions adjacent to the PU.1 site in GM-CSF receptor « fail to compete for the formation of this complex ( positions -41 to -25 [ Fig .
5 , lane 6 ] ; positions -80 to -49 [ Fig .
5 , lane 7 ] ) , suggesting that this complex is not formed with a neighboring DNA-binding protein , particularly not with C/EBP , which binds to the upstream area ( positions -80 to -49 ) , as shown below .
PU.1 forms a novel complex via its amino-terminal domain .
To further investigate which protein could be involved in the formation of PU-SF , we tested nuclear extracts from different sources .
Nuclear extracts from the B-lymphoblastoid cell line Raji also contain PU.1 and form complexes with the GM-CSF receptor « PU.1 site similar to those found in U937 nuclear extracts , except that relatively more PU-SF ( compared with full-length PU.1 ) is observed ( Fig .
5 , lane 13 ) .
Nuclear extracts from the T-lymphoblastoid cell lines Jurkat and REX , which do not contain PU.1 , fail to form any specific complex ( Fig .
5 , lane 16 ; Fig .
6A , lane 7 ) .
However , when in vitro-translated PU.1 is added to PU.l-negative nuclear extracts from REX cells , a complex similar to that seen in myeloid and B cells is formed ( Fig .
6A , lane 8 ) .
Moreover , nuclear extracts from a variety of cell lines , including HepG2 hepatoma cells ( Fig .
6B , lane 8 ) , Jurkat T cells and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells ( data not shown ) , the glial cell line U87 ( Fig .
6B , lane 4 ) , and monkey kidney Cos cells ( Fig .
6B , lane 10 ) are capable of forming PU-SF with in vitro-translated PU.1 .
However , the erythroid cell lines MEL , which overexpresses PU.1 , and CBS5 , which does not express PU.1 ( 58 ) , fail to form the PU-SF complex with in vitro-translated PU.1 ( Fig .
6A , lane 13 ; Fig .
6B , lane 2 ) .
We therefore conclude that a protein which is not restricted to the cell types in which PU.1 is expressed is involved in the formation of PU-SF .
Interestingly , Spi-B is also capable of forming the larger PU-SF complex ( data not shown ) .
To localize the domain of the PU.1 protein which interacts with this protein , we in vitro translated a series of PU.1 proteins with deletions in the amino terminus .
These truncated proteins retained the DNA binding domain located in the carboxyl-terminal sequence ( residues 167 to 255 ) and were therefore capable of binding to the PU.1 site ( Fig .
6A , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
We localized the region in the PU.1 protein involved in forming PU-SF to amino acids 32 to 70 in the transactivation domain : removal of either 133 or 70 amino acids from the amino terminus abolished the ability of PU.1 to form PU-SF ( Fig .
6A , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
However , deletion of amino acids 8 through 32 in the amino terminus did not abolish the formation of the complex ( Fig .
6A , lane 11 ) .
We investigated whether PU-SF involved TBP or RB protein , ubiquitously expressed proteins which have been previously shown to interact with the amino terminus of PU.1 in vitro ( 19 ) .
The expression pattern of PU-SF ( not in erythroid cells ) made it unlikely to be TBP or RB protein , and an anti 5836 HOHAUS ET AL .

DNA sequence requirements for the binding of PU-SF .
Various oligonucleotide probes were analyzed for their abilities to bind PU-SF by EMSA .
The probe number indicated at the top corresponds to the probe number in Table 1 , where the sequences are listed .
All probes were incubated with both in vitro-translated PU.1 and nuclear extracts from the Rex cell line , and in the even-numbered lanes they were inhibited with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide .
Lanes 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 13 , and 14 , GM-CSF receptor « probe , bp -53 to -37 , with single-stranded flanking BamHI and KpnI sites ( Table 1 , probe 1 ) .
Competition with the same oligonucleotide , unlabeled , is shown in lanes 2 , 8 , and 14 .
Lanes 3 and 4 , M-CSF receptor probe , bp -53 to -37 , with single-stranded flanking BamHI and KpnI sites ( Table 1 , probe 14 ) .
Lanes 5 and 6 , CD11b probe , bp -27 to -11 , with single-stranded flanking BamHI and KpnI sites ( Table 1 , probe 15 ) .

Lanes 15 and 16 : GM-CSF receptor a , bp -53 to -37 , with an 8-base single-stranded 5 ' overhang on the coding strand ( Table 1 , probe 8 ) .
Lanes 17 and 18 , GM-CSF receptor a , bp -53 to -37 , with an 8-base single-stranded 5 ' overhang on the noncoding strand ( Table 1 , probe 7 ) .
Abbreviations are as in Fig .

NF-EMS ( 47 ) , did not abolish the ability of PU.1 to form PU-SF ( Fig .
6A , lane 12 ) ; and ( iii ) the PU-SF complex migrated with a mobility distinctly slower than that formed by a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the PU.1/NF-EMS site from the x 3 ' enhancer ( 46 ) ( data not shown ) .
We further asked whether this interaction is specific for the GM-CSF receptor « promoter PU.1 site or whether other functional PU.1 sites in myeloid cells can form this complex .
In experiments performed simultaneously and run on the same gel , certain oligonucleotides containing the PU.1 site from the M-CSF receptor ( 70 ) or the CD11b promoter ( 41 ) failed to form PU-SF when incubated with U937 nuclear extracts ( Table 1 , probes 13 , 16 , and 18 ) .
Formation of PU-SF requires a single-stranded pyrimidine region .
The failure of certain M-CSF receptor or CD11b PU.1 site oligonucleotides to form a complex with PU-SF prompted us to investigate whether specific DNA sequences were required for such an interaction .
Methylation interference assays did not indicate any significant difference between the PU.1-and PU-SF-bound probe ( data not shown ) .
We then designed a series of oligonucleotide probes which we tested by EMSA with in vitro-translated PU.1 and nuclear extracts from the REX cell line , a combination which produced a large quantity of PU-SF-DNA complex ( Fig .
6A , lane 8 ) .
Interestingly , PU-SF formation was lost when both single-stranded flanking BamHI ( coding strand ) and KpnI ( noncod-ing strand ) sites were eliminated from the GM-CSF receptor a probe , but it was regained when either site was added back ( Table 1 , probes 1 to 4 ) or when those sequences were added to the M-CSF receptor and CD11b PU.1 binding sites ( Fig .
7 , lanes 3 to 6 .
In addition , we could not detect PU-SF when using a probe with double-stranded flanking BamHI and KpnI sites ( Fig .
7 , lanes 9 and 10 ) or when using a double-stranded probe which extended the GM-CSF receptor « sequence to an equiv- alent length ( Fig .
7 , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
However , 8-base single-stranded 5 ' overhangs of GM-CSF receptor « sequence on either the coding or noncoding strand were sufficient to allow the formation of the complex ( Fig .
7 , lanes 15 to 18 ) .
We then asked whether the requirement of PU-SF for single-stranded DNA was sequence specific .
Changing the cytosine residues at bp -57 and -58 of the GM-CSF receptor a 5 ' overhang to thymidines did not prevent the formation of the complex .
However , PU-SF could not be detected when the single-stranded 5 ' overhangs were constructed entirely of pu-rines ( Table 1 , probes 9 to 11 ) .
These data indicate that the formation of PU-SF has some requirement for pyrimidines as well as for single-stranded DNA .
Single-stranded oligonucleotides ( Table 1 , probes 1 , 7 , and 8 ) could not inhibit either the PU.1 or the PU-SF complexes , nor could an oligonucleotide ( GM1 [ see Fig .
9 ] ) mutated only at the PU.1 binding site ( data not shown ) .
However , an oligonucleotide which , as a probe , could bind PU.1 but not PU-SF ( Table 1 , probe 12 ) did inhibit both complexes ( data not shown ) .
These observations are consistant with the hypothesis that PU-SF requires PU.1 to bind DNA .
The single-stranded or mutated competitor is unable to bind PU.1 and therefore unable to bind PU-SF , and a competitor that binds PU.1 but not PU-SF will block PU.1 from the probe and therefore prevent binding to PU-SF indirectly .
Mutation of the PU.1 site abolishes binding of PU.1 and decreases promoter activity in myelomonocytic cells .
To define the residues in the GM-CSF receptor « promoter contacted by the PU.1 protein , methylation interference assays were performed with a DNA fragment including the region between positions -70 and +49 .
As shown in Fig .
8 , the PU.1 protein directly contacts the three G residues at positions -48 , -46 , and -45 .
No other strong contacts could be observed , indicating that this site is the only PU.1 binding site in the proximal Vou .

Methylation interference analysis of DNA contact points of PU.1 to the GM-CSF receptor « promoter .
The GM-CSF receptor « promoter fragment from bp -70 to +49 was end labeled on the 5 ' end of the noncoding strand and methylated by treatment with limiting quantities of dimethyl sulfate .
Free DNA ( lane F ) and DNA from the complex formed by in vitro-translated PU.1 with the bp -70 to +49 fragment ( lane ( B ) was subjected to piperidine-mediated cleavage of methylated guanosine residues .
Lane G/A , adenosine-guanosine sequence standards were prepared from the unmethylated probe by a chemical cleavage protocol ( 30 ) .
The sequence of the region between bp -53 and -42 is shown on the right .
The asterisks indicate the direct contacts between the DNA and PU.1 at residues -45 , -46 , and -48. promoter , since PU.1 also does not bind to oligonucleotides extending upstream to position -80 and downstream to +7 ( Fig .
5 , lanes 5 to 7 ) .
To verify the importance of PU.1 for the activity of the GM-CSF receptor « promoter , the three guanosine residues identified by methylation interference to be contacted by PU.1 were mutated into cytosine residues ( Fig .
9 ) .
An oligonucleotide with the mutated PU.1 site could not compete for PU.1 binding to the wild-type region from bp -53 to -37 ( Fig .
4 , lanes 5 and 10 ; Fig .
5 , lane 1 ) .
Furthermore , the same PU.1 mutant site oligonucleotide did not bind to PU.1 either as in vitro-translated protein or U937 nuclear extracts in gel shift assays ( Fig .
9 , lanes 3 and 7 ) .
The mutant oligonucleotide also was not able to form PU-SF observed with nuclear extracts , supporting the idea that DNA binding of PU.1 is critically involved in the formation of this complex ( Fig .
9 , lane 7 ) .
Additionally , no specific protein binding site was created by the mutation ( Fig .
9 , lane 7 ) .
In nuclear extracts from U937 cells , we observed only a nonspecific band ( Fig .
9 , lanes 7 to 10 ) which comigrated with a similar nonspecific band seen with the wild-type oligonucleotide ( Fig .
9 , lane 15 ) at a position slightly lower than that of PU.1 ( Fig .
9 , lanes 11 , 13 , and 14 ) .
This same mutation was then introduced into the GM-CSF receptor a promoter-luciferase construct .
We introduced the mutation both into -70GM-CSFr-luc , which retains full promoter activity compared with -393GM-CSFr-luc , and into -53GM-CSFr-luc , PU.1 AND C/EBPa « REGULATE GM-CSF RECEPTOR « GENE 5839 which has increased activity ( Fig .
3 ) .
Comparative analysis of transient transfections in U937 cells revealed that the promoter activities of both mutants were significantly decreased compared with that of the wild type ( Fig .
10 ) .
-53GM-CS-Fr ( GM-1 ) -luc , containing mutations of the PU.1 site at the three base pairs which contact PU.1 , demonstrated 31 % of the activity of the wild type ( Fig .
10A ) .
The activity of the -70GM-CSFr ( GM-1 ) -lue construct was reduced to 13 % of that of the wild-type promoter ( Fig .
10B ) .
In nonmyeloid Jurkat cells , the activity of -70GM-CSFr-lue was only 8 % of the activity in U937 cells , and mutation of the PU.1 site ( -70GM-CSFr ( GM-1 ) -lue did not result in a significant change of promoter activity ( Fig .
10B ) .
These data indicate the myeloid specificity and functional importance of PU.1 for the regulation of GM-CSF receptor « .
C/EBPa binds to the GM-CSF receptor « promoter .
Deletion analysis of the GM-CSF receptor a promoter identified a fragment between residues -70 and -54 whose deletion resulted in an increase in promoter activity ( Fig .
3 ) .
We asked whether proteins involved in negative regulation or involved in a competition between a positive and a negative factor could bind to this region .
A CCAAT site around bp -60 represents a potential protein binding site in this fragment .
CCAAT sites are target sequences for a variety of both general and cell-type-specific transcription factors ( 20 ) .
C/EBPs are involved in the control of cell-type-specific differentiation and proliferation , and the « , B , and 8 forms are expressed specifically in myeloid cells ( 36 , 57 ) .
Theses factors could be involved in myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation through the transcriptional control of the expression of growth factor receptors , like GM-CSF receptor « , that play a crucial role in this process .
We therefore analyzed whether this region can bind C/EBP .
An EMSA with a nuclear extract from U937 cells and an oligonucleotide spanning the GM-CSF receptor a promoter from position -80 to -49 showed binding of a specific complex ( complex C/EBPa ; Fig .
11 , lane 2 ) , which could be blocked by an excess of unlabeled self oligonucleotide ( Fig .
11 , lane 3 ) , by a shorter oligonucleotide spanning positions -70 to -54 and retaining the CCAAT region ( Fig .
11 , lane 4 ) , and by an oligonucleotide containing a C/EBP site from the M-CSF receptor ( ¢-fms ) ( Fig .
11 , lane 6 ) ( 69 , 71 ) .
However , an ets consensus binding oligonucleotide which binds multiple ets factors ( 23 , 66 ) could not inhibit the formation of this complex ( Fig .
11 , lane 5 ) .
The specific complex could be diminished by a rabbit antiserum raised against the carboxyl-terminal four-fifths of C/EBPa ( Fig .
11 , lane 8 ) but not by normal rabbit serum ( Fig .
11 , lane 7 ) or antisera against other C/EBP family members ( Fig .
11 , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
Besides the C/EBPa complex , we could identify faster-migrating specific complexes ( Fig .
11 , complexes B and C ) .
These complexes could be observed as well in Cos ?
cells ( Fig .
12 ) and may therefore represent non-cell-type-specific activities .
Competition studies with a 100-fold molar excess of either unlabeled strand of the probe indicated that complexes B and C bind single-stranded DNA ( data not shown ) .
Single-strand competitors containing sequences from bp -70 to -49 did not inhibit complexes B and C , while a single strand containing the sequence from bp -80 to -70 did , indicating that B and C bind the region from bp -80 to -70 of the probe when it is in a single-stranded form ( data not shown ) .
To obtain further evidence that the complex is C/EBPa , we performed a gel shift with a nuclear extract from Cos ?
cells which were transiently transfected with a C/EBPa expression plasmid ( Fig .
12 ) .
C/EBPa formed a specific complex with the oligonucleotide from bp -80 to -49 ( Fig .
12 , lane 2 ) , similar to that seen in the U937 cell nuclear extract ( Fig .
11 , lane 2 ) , which could also be inhibited by an oligonucleotide spanning 5840 HOHAUS ET AL .

Mutation of the PU.1 site abolishes PU.1 binding in EMSA .
The probe used in lanes 1 to 10 was a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the GM-CSF receptor a promoter from position -53 to -37 with point mutations of the guanosine residues ( bp -48 , -46 , and -45 ) identified by methylation interference to be involved in PU.1 binding ( Fig .
8 ) ( GM1 ) .
In lanes 11 to 15 , the probe was the wild-type ( wt ) oligonucleotide used as a control .
Probes were end labeled and incubated with either 1 pl of in vitro-translated PU.1 ( lanes 3 to 6 and 11 to 13 ) or 10 pg of nuclear extract from U937 cells ( lanes 7 to 10 , 14 , and 15 ) .
A 100-fold molar excess of the following unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides was added to the reaction mixtures : mutated PU.1 site GM-CSF receptor a promoter ( GM1 ) ( lanes 4 , 8 , and 13 ) , wild-type GM-CSF receptor a promoter bp -53 to -37 ( Wt ) ( lanes 5 , 9 , 12 , and 15 ) , and GM-CSF receptor a promoter bp -41 to -25 ( lanes 6 and 10 ) .
All other abbreviations are as in Fig .
4 and 6 .
A nonspecific complex , which does not compete with excess cold self oligonucleotide ( lane 9 ) , migrates just ahead of PU.1 and is seen in lanes 7 to 10 , 14 , and 15 ( also observed in Fig .
4 to 6 ) .
positions -70 to -54 ( data not shown ) but not by an oligonucleotide in which the adenosine residues of the CCAAT site were mutated into guanosine residues ( GM2 ) ( Fig .
12 , lane 4 ) .
Moreover , this complex could be inhibited by a high-affinity C/EBP binding site ( Fig .
12 , lane 6 ) ( 5 , 60 ) but not by a mutated site ( Fig .
12 , lane 7 ) .
C/EBPa binding was abolished by the specific « antiserum ( Fig .
12 , lane 9 ) , while antisera against C/EBPB and C/EBP38 had no effect ( Fig .
12 , lanes 10 and 11 ) .
Gel shift assays with Cos7 cell extracts transfected with C/EBPB and -8 resulted also in the formation of specific complexes with the oligonucleotide probe from bp -80 to -49 which appeared similar to complexes formed by these extracts with the high-affinity consensus C/EBP site ( 5 , 60 ) ( data not shown ) .
However , the binding of C/EBPB to the GM-CSF receptor « CCAAT site was much weaker than that observed with the consensus high-affinity C/EBP site ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , supershift experiments with antisera raised against C/EBPB and -8 and the oligonucleotide from bp -80 to -49 did not result in supershifts in U937 nuclear extracts ( Fig .
11 , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
The faint complex ( NS ) suggesting a supershift can also be observed in Cos ?
extracts transfected with C/EBPa ( seen in the longer exposures of Fig .
12 , lanes 10 and 11 ) but not in untransfected Cos ?
cells , and it therefore most likely represents a cross-reaction of these C/EBP antibodies with C/EBPa .
However , in U937 cells , we observed significant levels of C/EBPa and not C/EBPB or C/EBP38 ( Fig .
11 ) ( 71 ) .
From these results taken together , we conclude that homodimers of C/EBPa are the major C/EBP form in U937 cells binding to the GM-CSF receptor a CCAAT site .
Mutation of the CCAAT site abolishes binding of C/EBPa and diminishes promoter activity .
To address the question whether this CCAAT site could be responsible for the negative regulatory effect of this area , we mutated this site by point mutations changing two adenosine residues at positions -60 and -61 into guanosines , which abolished the binding of C/EBP ( Fig .
12 , lane 4 ) .
We introduced this mutation to form the mutant construct -70GM-CSFr ( GM-2 ) -lue .
Comparative analysis of this construct in transient transfections in U937 cells revealed that this site is a positive regulatory site .
Mutation of the CCAAT site diminished the activity to 30 % of the wild-type activity in U937 cells ( Fig .
10B ) .
However , in nonmyeloid Jurkat cells the activity of -70GM-CSFr ( GM-2 ) -lue was slightly greater than that of the wild-type construct , indicating the myeloid specificity of the positive function of the CCAAT site .
These data point to a positive-negative role of the region from bp -70 to -54 in which C/EBPa acts as a positive regulator .
Mutation of both the PU.1 and CCAAT sites had no additional effect above that of a single mutation of each site , pointing to an independent function of each site ( results of two experi-ments ; data not shown ) .
PU.1 and C/EBPa activate the GM-CSF receptor « promoter in nonmyeloid cells .

The activity of the GM-CSF receptor « pro moter in the presence of cotransfected full-length PU.1 was increased to twice that of the control , while the presence of C/EBPa increased the promoter activity to 180 % ( Fig .

A 100-fold molar excess of the following unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides was added to the reaction mixtures : GM-CSF receptor « promoter position -80 to -49 ( self ) ( lane 3 ) , GM-CSF receptor a promoter -70 to -54 ( lane 4 ) , E18 ets consensus site ( see Table 1 ) ( nonself ) ( lane 5 ) ( 23 , 66 ) , and M-CSF receptor ( ¢-fms ) promoter C/EBP site ( lane 6 ) .
In lanes 7 to 10 , 1.5 pl of antisera against C/EBPa ( lane 8 ) , C/EBPB ( lane 9 ) , and C/EBP 8 ( lane 10 ) or normal rabbit serum ( lane 7 ) were added to the reaction mixtures .

Furthermore , PU.1 was able to enhance the activity of a construct which contained a single PU.1 binding site upstream of the minimal TK promoter an average of sixfold ( Fig .

A plasmid with a mutation in the PU.1 binding site did not show transactivation greater than that of the minimal TK promoter .
These results support the functional importance of C/EBPa and PU.1 in the regulation of GM-CSF receptor « expression .
Moreover , it delineates a role for the amino-terminal domain of PU.1 in the activation of the GM-CSF receptor « promoter .
DISCUSSION The expression of specific growth factor receptors is critically important for the development of hematopoietic cells , and therefore the factors regulating their expression could be key regulators of hematopoiesis .
Recently PU.1 emerged as a candidate key regulator as suggested by gene inactivation and targeting studies ( 56 , 66 ) .
Most myeloid cell-specific gene promoters , including the M-CSF receptor ( 70 ) , contain functional PU.1 sites .

scription factors for hematopoiesis is less well studied ; only a few mammalian myeloid target genes have been definitely identified so far ( 3 , 4 , 36 , 37 , 48 ) .
Here , we demonstrate that the 5'-flanking region of the GM-CSF receptor « gene , which demonstrates cell-type-specific activity in myeloid cells , contains functionally important PU.1 and C/EBPa sites .
While PU.1 and C/EBPa « are also expressed outside the myeloid lineage , myeloid specificity could be obtained by the combination of both factors .
PU.1 , expressed in myeloid and B cells ( 6 , 24 ) , is critical for the myeloid activity of the GM-CSF receptor « promoter , as is C/EBP , which within the hematopoietic system is expressed specifically in myeloid cells and not in other lineages , such as B cells ( 57 , 64 ) .
In the region extending from position -80 to -49 , we could detect specific DNA binding in U937 myeloid cells by C/EBPa but not by other C/EBP proteins .
The mutation of two bases within this region ( mutant GM2 , containing mutations in the CCAAT site at bp -60 and =61 ) , which abolished C/EBPa binding , decreased promoter activity by 70 % , indicating that C/EBPa acts as a significant positive regulator of GM-CSF receptor « .
However , two other complexes , found in both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells , bind to this region ( complexes B and C ; Fig .
11 and 12 ) .

Transactivation of the GM-CSF receptor a PU.1 site .
( A ) Transactivation of the GM-CSF receptor promoter in nonmyeloid cells .
The hepatoma cell line HepG2 was transfected by the Ca , ( PO , ) , precipitation method with 10 g of the GM-CSF receptor « promoter construct -70GM-CSFr-luc and with one of the following expression constructs : none ( bar 1 ) , the PU.1 expression construct PUpECE ( +PU.1 ) ( bar 2 ) , an expression construct with amino acids 1 to 133 of PU.1 deleted ( +N133 ) ( bar 3 ) , an expression construct with amino acids 1 to 70 of PU.1 deleted ( +N70 ) ( bar 4 ) , and the C/EBPa expression construct MSV-C/EBPa ( +C/EBPa ) ( bar 5 ) .
Luciferase was measured 40 h after transfection and normalized for transfection efficiency with the cotransfected growth hormone plasmid CMV-hGH .
The data are the means of three independent experiments .
The standard errors of the means are indicated by the error bars .

CV-1 cells were transfected with either the parental TK-luciferase vector ( pT81-luc ) , pT81-luc containing a single PU.1 site with the GM1 mutation ( described in Materials and Methods and shown in Fig .

The results are expressed as the average fold increase in activity upon addition of PUpECE .
The error bars represent the standard error of the mean of at least four experiments .
PU.1 AND C/EBPa « REGULATE GM-CSF RECEPTOR « GENE 5843 mutation ( Fig .
12 , lane 4 ) but can be inhibited by either unlabeled strand containing sequences from bp -80 to -70 , suggesting that they are formed by single-strand-binding proteins which do not exhibit strand specificity .
Deletion of the region from bp -70 to -53 led to an increase in promoter activity in U937 cells ( Fig .
3 ) , indicating that this region mediates negative as well as positive regulatory effects .
Competition by overlapping binding sites of a non-cell-type-specific factor with C/EBP could contribute to cell type specificity .
An example for the model of competition by use of overlapping DNA binding sites between negative and positive factors has been described for the myeloid cell-specific gp91-phox promoter ( 61 ) .
Binding of the ubiquitously expressed CCAAT displacement protein results in repression of the gp91-phox gene in nonmyeloid and early myeloid cells ( 61 ) .
DNA binding studies with the CCAAT region of GM-CSF receptor « showed that CCAAT displacement protein does not bind to this region ( data not shown ) .
Another example for negative regulation is the conversion of a transcriptional activator into a repressor .
The beta interferon gene , which is upregulated by viral induction , is switched off in uninduced cells by a repressor that first was believed to block the binding to an adjacent NF-B site ( 17 ) .
This protein has been recently cloned in Drosophila melanogaster as the high-mobility-group ( HMG ) -like protein DSP1 , which can switch NF-kB from a transcriptional activator to a repressor ( 27 ) .
In the case of GM-CSF receptor « , further studies are needed to identify the putative negative regulatory factor or factors , their mechanism of action , and their roles in the regulation of expression of the receptor .
We identified C/EBPa « to be the major C/EBP form in myeloid extracts of U937 cells binding to the CCAAT site at position -61 .
This finding is consistent with previous protein expression data obtained by immunoblots ( 57 ) .
The relative expression of C/EBP proteins is temporally regulated during myeloid cell differentiation ( 36 , 57 ) .
It is interesting to speculate that changes in the C/EBP expression pattern could influence the expression of GM-CSF receptor « .
It is noteworthy that GM-CSF receptor a is upregulated early during IL-3-plus-GM-CSF-induced differentiation of CD34* progenitor cells and decreases later when the cells have undergone further maturation ( data not shown ) .
A similar pattern has been observed for protein expression of C/EBPa during differentiation of the murine myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dc13 ( 57 ) .
Other C/EBPa target genes in myeloid cells include the receptor for M-CSF ( 69 , 71 ) and G-CSF ( 62 ) , both of which are also regulated by PU.1 ( 62 , 70 ) .
Therefore , we postulate a major role for C/EBPs in the specific expression of myeloid CSF receptor genes .
It will be the focus of future research to elucidate the role of the C/EBPs in myeloid cell differentiation .
GM-CSF receptor « is predicted by these studies to be a critical target for these transcription factors .
In gel shifts with the GM-CSF receptor a promoter PU.1 site , we observed the formation of a more slowly migrating complex ( PU-SF ) with nuclear extracts of myeloid and B cells .
This complex could be formed by addition of nuclear extracts from a variety of cell types ( but not from erythroid cells ) to either PU.1 or the closely related ets family member Spi-B ( 51 ) .
We have not observed formation of the PU-SF complex when the PU.1 binding site is replaced by a C/EBP binding site , even when the oligonucleotide contains single-stranded ends ( 62a ) .
Comparative analysis with studies of other myeloid PU.1 sites indicates that this complex is not unique for the GM-CSF receptor « PU.1 site .
Our data suggest that the PU-SF complex is novel and does not involve proteins which have been previously shown to interact with PU.1 : TBP ( 19 ) , RB protein ( 19 ) , 5844 HOHAUS ET AL .
or NF-EMS ( 11 , 46 , 47 ) .
The importance of the formation of PU-SF for the activity of the GM-CSF receptor a promoter was supported by transactivation of the promoter by full-length PU.1 but not by amino-terminally truncated forms of the PU.1 protein which fail to form PU-SF .
In these studies , the magnitude of transactivation of GM-CSF receptor « by PU.1 was only twofold .
However , the extent of transactivation does not necessarily reflect the functional importance of the PU.1 site , particularly when the transactivation studies are performed with the native promoter .
Another promoter with a functionally critical PU.1 site which is only moderately transactivated ( two- to threefold ) by PU.1 is CD11b ( 41 ) .
Experiments performed with the PU.1 site placed upstream of a heterologous promoter show that the GM-CSF receptor « PU.1 site could be transactivated an average of sixfold .
EMSA studies indicate that DNA interaction with PU-SF requires , in addition to PU.1 , a single-stranded region of DNA containing pyrimidines proximal to a PU.1 binding site .
Although the inability of the amino-truncated forms of PU.1 protein to transactivate GM-CSF receptor « supports the hypothesis that PU-SF has a functional role in this promoter , we can not yet exclude the possibility that those regions of the PU.1 protein are critical for an unrelated activating function .
Additional studies will be required to establish the functional importance of the formation of PU-SF .
There is substantial evidence for the role of single-stranded binding factors in other promoters , both as activators and repressors ( 31 , 65 , 67 ) .
In the simplest scenario , two factors which bind to opposite strands of the same site , VACssBF1 and VACssBF2 , have been shown to play a role in repression of the vascular smooth muscle « -actin gene promoter , perhaps by stabilizing single-stranded structure and preventing the binding of a positive regulatory factor which requires double-stranded DNA ( 65 ) .
Other theories include stabilization of single-stranded regions that serve to relieve torsional stress induced by transcription or provide a flexible joint to facilitate DNA-bound protein-protein interactions ( 9 ) .
Wang et al .
postulate that the binding of the serum response factor to the serum response element of the platelet-derived growth factor A-chain promoter induces DNA bending and strain which can be released by strand separation and that this altered conformation is stabilized by a second , single-stranded binding factor , SSBF ( 67 ) .
It is possible that the interaction between PU.1 and PU-SF provides a similar function .
For example , PU.1 might recruit PU-SF to stabilize an alternative DNA conformation .
The domain of the PU.1 protein involved in the formation of PU-SF is located in the amino terminus between amino acids 32 and 70 .
Other PU.1 targets in which the amino-terminal region of the protein is essential include the J chain gene in B cells ( 59 ) and the IL-18 promoter in myeloid cells ( 25 ) .
Further localization of the domain in the PU.1 protein responsible for the formation of PU-SF and identification of the factor involved in PU-SF formation will help to define the specific role of PU-SF in GM-CSF receptor « expression .
