Molecular Regulation of the Human IL-3 Gene : Inducible T Cell-Restricted Expression Requires Intact AP-1 and Elf-1 Nuclear Protein Binding Sites By Lisa R. Gottschalk , * Diane M. Giannola , t and Stephen G. Emersont From the *Department of Medicine , University of Chicago , Illinois 60637 ; and the tDepartment of Internal Medicine , University of Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 Summary Interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) is a hematopoietic stem-cell growth and differentiation factor that is expressed solely in activated T and NK cells .
Studies to date have identified elements 5 ' to the IL-3 coding sequences that regulate its transcription , but the sequences that confer T cell-specific expression remain to be clearly defined .
We have now identified DNA sequences that are required for T cell-restricted IL-3 gene transcription .
A series of transient transfections performed with human IL-3-chloremphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmids in T and non-T cells revealed that a plasmid containing 319 bp of 5 ' flanking sequences was active exclusively in T cells .
Deletion analysis revealed that T cell specificity was conferred by a 49-bp fragment ( bp -319 to -270 ) that included a potential binding site for AP-1 transcription factors 6 bp upstream of a binding site for Elf-1 , a member of the Ets family of transcription factors DNasel footprint and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses performed with MLA-144 T cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that this 49-bp region contains a nuclear protein binding region that includes consensus AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites .
In addition , extracts prepared from purified human T cells contained proteins that bound to synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites .
In vitro-transcribed and translated Elf-1 protein bound specifically to the Elf-1 site , and Elf-1 antisera competed and super shifted nuclear protein complexes present in MLA-144 nuclear extracts .
Moreover , addition of anti-Jun family antiserum in electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions completely blocked formation of the AP-1-related complexes .
Transient transfection studies in MLA-144 T cells revealed that constructs containing mutations in the AP-1 site almost completely abolished CAT activity while mutation of the EIf-1 site or the NF-IL-3 site , a previously described nuclear protein binding site ( bp -155 to -148 ) in the IL-3 promoter , reduced CAT activity to < 25 % of the activity given by wild-type constructs .
We conclude that expression of the human IL-3 gene requires the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites ; however , unlike other previously characterized cytokine genes such as IL-2 , the AP-1 and Elf-1 factors can bind independently in the IL-3 gene .
Thus , the exact DNA composition of these sites , flanking DNA sequences , and the distance between the AP-1 and Ets family binding sites determine the fine specificity of nuclear factors that bind to these sites and the resulting inducible , cell-restricted expression of a group of lymphokine genes .
he growth factor interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) is a major regu- lator of hematopoiesis .
The role of IL-3 is particularly interesting because IL-3 is secreted from T and NK cells and primarily acts on both early stem cells and hematopoietic cells committed to distinct lineages ( 1 , 2 ) .
Alone , IL-3 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow precursor cells to produce macrophages , eosinophils , and mast cells , and in combination with other growth factors , IL-3 influences the development of erythrocytes , megakaryocytes , and neu-trophils ( 3-5 ) .
In addition , IL-3 supports the growth of cell lines derived from bone marrow cultures and enhances retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into bone marrow stem cells ( 6 , 7 ) .
Thus , this lymphokine forms a bridge between the immune system and homeostasis in non-immune tissues .
IL-3 is distinguished from other growth factors by its restricted cellular expression and mode of induction .
Thus , only activated CD28 * T cells and NK cells ( 8-10 ) produce IL-3 , whereas growth factors such as GM-CSF and G-CSF are expressed in a variety of cell types ( 11-13 ) .
In addition , the agent of activation is critical to optimal IL-3 gene induction in human T cells .
In contrast to other cytokines such as IL-2 , TNF- « , lymphotoxin ( LT ) , IFN-y , and GM-CSF , incubation of T 1681 __ J. Exp .

To induce high-level IL-3 gene expression , T cells must be activated via the TCR/CD3 pathway or with agents that mimic this pathway ( PMA and ionomycin ) ( 8 ) .
Although much is known regarding the biological activities and requirements for induction of IL-3 in vitro , relatively little is understood about the regulation of expression of this gene .
The genes for both the murine and the human homo-logue of IL-3 have been cloned ( 15 , 16 ) , and comparison between the two sequences reveals a low level of sequence identity except for some short regions of sequence homology in the 5° and 3 ' flanking regions .
Two recent reports have demonstrated that IL-3 mRNA accumulation is controlled at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels ( 17 , 18 ) .
The studies describing transcriptional regulation of the IL-3 gene have shown that the IL-3 promoter consists of two activating regions separated by an inhibitory region ( 19-21 ) .
The 3 ' activating region contains two motifs common to many lymphokine promoters , the CK-1 and CK-2 elements ( 22 ) .
In addition , the 3 ' activating region contains a sequence similar to the Oct-1 motif ( 23 , 24 ) , NF-IL-3 , and an element immediately 3 ' that is similar to a cAMP-responsive element ( CRE ) ( 25 ) .
These latter two motifs , referred to as ACT -1 ( 21 ) may be important for IL-3 activation .
The inhibitory region includes a sequence referred to as NIP that binds a nuclear protein in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) !
( 19 ) thought to restrict IL-3 expression to T cells .
However , as the NIP site also appears to be functionally inhibitory in activated ML A-144 gibbon T cells , this site alone can not be responsible for the restriction of IL-3 expression to T cells .
A number of recent studies have shown that the regulatory regions of inducible T cell-related genes contain an AP-1 nuclear protein binding site in close proximity to an Ets family nuclear protooncogene binding site , and these sites are required for inducible gene expression ( 26 , 27 ) .
Of note , the 5 activation region of IL-3 contains a consensus binding site for the AP-1 transcription factors .
Notably , the AP-1 motif has been shown to confer phorbol ester inducibility upon heterologous reporter genes ( 28 , 29 ) and is thought to regulate activation of many inducible genes ( 30 ) .
In addition , the human IL-3 promoter contains a consensus Ets family binding site 6 bp 3 ' of the AP-1 motif .
Thus , given the distinct lineage restricted and TCR-inducible pattern of IL-3 gene expression , it was of interest to address the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of these sites in regulating IL-3 gene expression .
In this report , we show that the AP-1 and an Ets family binding site , Elf-1 , are required for inducible IL-3 gene expression .
Moreover , the 49-bp fragment containing the AP-1 and Elf-1 nuclear protein binding sites contributes to T cell-restricted expression of the IL-3 gene .

1682 quirement of AP-1 factor complex formation for NFAT binding activity seen in the IL-2 enhancer ( 27 ) , the AP-1 and Elf-1 sites in the IL-3 gene can bind their respective proteins or protein complexes independently .
We also confirm that the NFE-IL-3 site is required for IL-3 gene expression .
These data provide the basis for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of T cell IL-3 gene regulation and its role in the cellular link between the immune system and nonimmune cell proliferation .

Results Isolation and Characterization of a Genomic Clone Containing the Human IL-3 Gene .
We isolated a clone containing the full-length IL-3 gene from a human genomic library with a human IL-3 cDNA as a probe and standard techniques .
This clone includes 3 kb of 5 ' flanking sequence and 5 kb of 3 ' flanking sequence .
To identify regulatory elements in the 5 !
flanking region , we sequenced 1,400 bp of DNA 5 '' of the transcriptional start site ( Fig .

Two additional EBS are present in the IL-3 5 flanking sequences ( -108 to ~98 ; -230 to -220 ) , in addition to a CD28-responsive element ( CD28R ; bp -126 to ~116 ; GAGGTTCCATG ) ( 42 ) .
The finding of a CD28-responsive element is of interest because earlier studies in this laboratory demonstrated that IL-3 gene expression is limited to the CD28 * T cell subpopulation ( 8 ) .
Contained within the lymphokine CK-2 motif is a consensus sequence for the GATA-3 transcription factor ( AGATAA ) ( 43 ) , and this site is conserved within murine IL-3 gene sequences .
Finally , a site similar in 8 of 10 bp to the NIP inhibitory motif ( 19 ) is located 657 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site .
Identification of cis- Acting Transcriptional Regulatory Sequences that May Be Involved in T Cell-Restricted IL-3 Gene Expres sion .
- In an effort to define transcriptional regulatory elements that modulate IL-3 gene expression , we examined a series of heterologous reporter constructs containing the bacterial CAT gene and human genomic IL-3 subfragments in various cell lines .
Initially , a set of contiguous DNA segments from the 5 flanking region of the IL-3 gene was cloned in 5° to 3 ' orientation directly 5 '' of the CAT gene in the promoterless/enhancerless vector , pCAT-basic .

Transcriptional activity of CAT constructs containing 5 ' flanking region DNA segments of the human IL-3 gene in various cell lines .
IL-3-CAT constructs containing 150-319 bp of 5 flanking DNA sequences of the human IL-3 gene with 30 bp of 55 untranslated DNA cloned into pCAT were transiently transfected into Jurkat , PEER , and MLA-144 T cells , into Clone 13 B cells , and into Hela fibroblasts , along with an efficiency plasmid , pRSV gal or pRSVluciferase , and tested for transcriptional activity .
Some of the nuclear protein binding sites that these constructs included are shown at top .
Following transfection , the cells were divided into two groups : the first was maintained in media only while the second was induced with activation agents known to elicit IL-3 .
The activation agents ( denoted by + ) used in Jurkat , PEER , and Clone 13 cells were PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 400 ng/ml ) , and those used in MLA-144 cells were PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) and PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) .
The various cell lines were induced for 6-8 h before the harvest of extracts , and these extracts , normalized for transfection efficiencies , were used in CAT assays as previously described .
Relative CAT activity is shown in the table { mean and SD ) and represents the activity given by a particular construct compared to the activity given by the pCAT vector alone .
Each construct was tested four times in Jurkat , PEER , and MLA-144 cells , three times in Clone 13 cells and twice in Hela cells with different plasmid preparations .
CK-2 , CRE , and NF-IL-3 elements ) of 5 '' flanking sequence ( with 30 bp of 5 untranslated sequences ) increased CAT activity after activation in all cell lines tested .
CAT activity was also observed in transfected Hela cells and lower level activity was demonstrated in unstimulated T and B cells .
In contrast , a construct containing 319 bp of 5° flanking sequence was active exclusively in T cells .
Deletion analysis demonstrated that this activity was lost in T cells when 49 bp was removed from the 319-bp construct , and this construct was also inactive in non-T cell lines .
The 49-bp DNA segment ( bp -319 to -270 ) contains a consensus AP-1 nuclear protein binding site ( bp -301 to -295 ) 6 bp 5 ' to the Elf-1 nuclear protein binding site described above .
Such an AP-1/Ets family member nuclear protein binding cassette has been implicated in the activation of other cytokine genes ( 26 , 27 ) .
Although -270CAT included the putative silencer NIP , mutation of the NIP site from GCTGCCATGC to TCTTCA-CTTG in the context of -270CAT failed to increase CAT activity in MLA-144 T cells or in Clone 13 B cells to the level demonstrated by ~175CAT ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that additional DNA sequence is necessary for full activity in T cells regardless of the status of NIP site integrity , or that the low-level activity given by -270CAT is not en- Molecular Regulation of the Human IL-3 Gene tirely due to the NIP site .
Together , these data provide evidence that the 49-bp fragment is required for the T cell-restricted pattern of IL-3 gene expression and that it may function in concert with other negative regulatory elements within the IL-3 promoter .
Activation of ML A-144 Cells Induces High-level IL-3 Gene Transcripts and Nuclear Proteins that Bind to DNA Sequences within the 49-bp Fragment in the 5° Flanking Sequences of the IL-3 Gene .
To study further the role of the 49-bp fragment in IL-3 gene transcription , it was necessary to identify cells that could be induced to express high levels of IL-3 .
Northern blot analysis of RNA obtained from Jurkat and PEER T cells revealed that these cells produced extremely low levels of IL-3 gene transcripts ( data not shown ) .
However , as shown in Fig .
3 A , MLA-144 cells can be induced by incubation for 8 h with PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) and PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) to produce high levels of IL-3 gene transcripts and to a lesser degree after incubation with PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 400 ng/ml ) or with PMA ( 100 ng/ml ) alone .
These levels were comparable with levels of IL-3 expression obtained in primary human T cells ( L. Gottschalk , unpublished results ) .
Notably , no IL-3 gene transcription was detected in RNA prepared from cells incubated with media alone .
These data confirm that , unlike other inducible cytokine genes , IL-3 gene expression is not induced with PHA alone ( 8 ) and suggest that relatively unique molecular mechanisms may regulate IL-3 gene transcription .
To identify nuclear protein binding sites within the 49-bp subfragment of the human IL-3 gene promoter that conferred T cell specificity in CAT assay studies , we subjected a 193-bp DNA subfragment ( bp -319 to -126 ; sense strand ) containing the 49-bp segment ( bp -319 to -270 ) to DNasel footprint analysis .

100 ug uns 150 ug uns 200 ug uns and C shows that nuclear extracts prepared from MLA-144 cells protected the AP-1 site , Elf-1 site , and intervening DNA from digestion by DNasel ( bracketed and boxed ) and that no other regions in the 49-bp segment within the 193-bp fragment bound nuclear proteins .
Because these sites were protected by nuclear extracts prepared from both unstimulated and stimulated ML A-144 cells , further characterization of the proteins that interact with the IL-3 gene DNA was performed by EMSAs .
ML A-144 Cells Contain Multiple Specific Nuclear Proteins that Bind to DNA Sequences in the IL-3 Promoter .
To determine the number and the specificity of nuclear proteins that bind to the protected sequences present in the 49-bp IL-3 gene subfragment , we performed a series of EMSAs with MLA-144 nuclear extracts and double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 and Elf-1 nuclear protein binding sites .
Fig .
4 A shows that when nuclear extracts from resting ML A-144 cells were tested with the AP-1/Elf1 DNA probe ( including intervening DNA ) , four low-mobility bands { arrows ) bound specifically , as demonstrated by competition with wild-type oligonucleotides ( lane 2 ) but not by unrelated DNA competitor ( MNIP , lane 6 ) or a mutant Elf-1 DNA competitor ( lane 4 ) .
Specific bands were also demonstrated using stimulated ML A-144 extracts ; however , with the exception of the lowest mobility band , the bands were difficult to distinguish .
Of note , the highest mobility bands do not appear to be specific because they are present despite the addition of wild-type DNA competitors .
Further cold competition experiments revealed that an oligonucleotide corresponding to a consensus AP-1 nuclear protein binding site competed the middle complexes in both unstimulated and stimulated nuclear extracts ( lanes 5 and 11 ) .

( B ) EMSA analyses using radiolabeled AP-1 as a probe with stimulated MLA-144 nuclear extracts .
Unia-beled competitor oligonucleotides ( 200 ng ) were used as marked .
competition with an oligonucleotide that corresponds to the Elf-1 site alone showed that the lowest mobility specific band is competed when mixed with the AP-1/Elf-1 probe and both stimulated and unstimulated extracts .
In addition , when an Elf-1 DNA competitor is added in EMSA at the same time with AP-1 DNA competitor , the lower predominant band evident in lanes 5 and 11 ( AP-1 DNA competitor alone ) is reduced suggesting that there are two bands that run with similar mobility , one binding to the AP-1 site and one binding to the EIf-1 site ( data not shown ) .
Together , the EMSAs demonstrate specific and distinct complex formation with the AP-1/Elf-1 oligonucleotide probe and proteins from both unstimulated and stimulated MLA-144 cells .
Fig .
4 B shows that an oligonucleotide corresponding to the AP-1 binding site in the IL-3 gene specifically bound nuclear proteins from stimulated ML A-144 cells in the absence of the EIf-1 site ( lanes 1 , 3 , and 4 ) .
However , comparison of the complexes formed with the AP-1/Elf-1 probe described above to those formed with the AP-1 probe alone ( Fig .
4 B ) and the Elf-1 probe alone ( see Fig .
6 , lane 5 ) demonstrate that at least some of the binding activity observed with the AP-1/Elf-1 probe may require cooperative binding of AP-1 and Elf-1 or of yet undefined transcription factors .
Of note , the addition of unlabeled NF-IL-3 competitor eliminated all complex formation observed with a labeled AP-1 consensus probe ( Fig .
4 B , lane 2 ) and stimulated extracts , suggesting that the NF-IL-3 nuclear protein binding site may bind AP-1 transcription factors .
The AP-1/Elf1 DNA Probe Binds In Vitro Transcribed/Trans-lated Elf-1 Protein and Is Competed by Anti-Elf-1 Sera .
To test whether Elf-1 protein binds to the EBS in the IL-3 promoter , truncated and full-length in vitro-transcribed/translated Elf-1 protein was used in EMSAs with the AP-1/Elf-1 DNA probe .
Because truncated EIlf-1 protein ( Elf-li0es » ) binds with equivalent specificity as full-length Elf-1 protein ( 44 ) and because of higher translation efficiency of smaller transcripts in vitro , the truncated version was used in competition experiments .
As seen in Fig .
5 , the AP-1/Elf-1 DNA probe bound truncated Elf-1 ( Elf 1 , lane 2 ) .
This binding activity was abolished by the addition of unlabeled wild-type Elf-1 competitor ( lanes 3 and 4 ) but was still present when nonspecific DNA competitor was added ( lane 5 ) .
As expected , no binding activity was observed when in vitro translation reactions without transcribed RNA was used in EMSAs ( lanes 1 and 6 ) .
Finally , a control probe that contains an Elf-1 nuclear protein binding site from the MSV LTR ( MSV ) bound the in vitro-transcribed and translated tElf-1 protein ( lane 7 ) .
These EMSA data demonstrate that Elf-1 protein can bind directly to DNA sequences in the IL-3 promoter , Addition of Elf1 and Jun Antisera Block Complex Formation in EMSA Reactions with ML A-144 Nuclear Extracts .
To identify the proteins within MLA-144 nuclear extracts that bind to IL-3 promoter DNA sequences , we performed EMSAs as above with anti-Jun and anti-Elf-1 antisera .
Fig .
6 shows that addition of anti-Jun family serum which recognizes JunB , JunD , and c-Jun blocked the formation of the middle complexes with both unstimulated and stimulated ML A-144 nuclear extracts ( compare lanes 1 and 8 with 3 and 10 ) .
As described above , the same bands were blocked by addition of consensus AP-1 DNA competitor .
When specific anti-Elf-1 serum was added into the EMSA reactions , it was difficult to demonstrate the disappearance of a band using the AP-1/ Elf-1 DNA probe ( lane 2 ) ; however , the higher mobility band ( closed arrow ) formation was blocked in EMSA reactions containing the shorter Elf-1 DNA probe ( -ELF-1 ; compare lanes 5 and 6 ) .

- EMSA using radiolabeled AP-1/EIf-1 , Elf-1 , or MSV oligonucleotide probes with unstimulated or stimulated MLA-144 nuclear protein extracts in the presence of various antisera .
Various antisera , as noted , were incubated with the nuclear proteins for 15 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe .
Lanes 1-7 were run on one gel while lanes 8-11 were run on a separate gel .
The complex corresponding to full-length Elf1 ( £-Elf-1 ) is denoted by a closed arrow as well as the supershifted complexes { open arrows ) evident in lanes 2 , 6 , and 11 .
Preimmune sera and anti-IL-2 receptor ( IL 2R ) were used as controls .
the band observed in EMSA reactions containing in vitro , translated full-length ElK-1 protein and the AP-1/Elf-1 probe { data not shown ) .
In addition , a faint supershifted complex ( open arrow ) was observed in reactions containing either DNA probe with unstimulated MLA-144 nuclear extracts ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , and in reactions with the AP-1/EIlf-1 probe and stimulated extracts ( compare lanes 10 and 11 ) .
The addition of IL-2R antibody or preimmune serum did not alter the binding activities observed with either probe or with either nuclear extract ( lanes 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ) .
Interestingly , the specific band with the lowest mobility observed with both probes ( lanes 2 and 6 ) was unaffected by addition of the Elf-1 antiserum .
However , the binding activity appeared to be greater in the absence of the AP-1 nuclear protein binding site ( with Elf-1 probe ) .
This band was also present when nuclear extracts prepared from PEER and Jurkat T cells , and Clone 13 B cells were used ( data not shown ) .
In summary , these EMSA data demonstrate that ML A-144 T cells contain proteins that bind specifically to AP-1 and Elf-1 nucleotide sequences , that Elf-1 protein binds to the Elf-1 nucleotide sequences in vitro , and that Elf-1 and Jun antisera block proteins or protein complexes within MLA-144 nuclear extracts that bind to these two sites .
Intact AP-1 and Elf-1 Nuclear Protein Binding Sites Are Required for Full Functional Activity .
We next asked whether 1687 Gottschalk et al .
the NF-IL-3 , AP-1 , and Elf-1 sites that bound nuclear proteins played important functional roles in IL-3 gene transcriptional activation in intact MLA-144 cells .
A series of mutant IL-3 promoter constructs were produced and tested for transcriptional activity after transfection into MLA-144 cells .
Mutations were introduced into the -319-bp promoter in the AP-1 , the Elf-1 , the NF-IL-3 nuclear protein binding sites or in a combination of sites ( changes noted in Materials and Methods and in the figure legend ) .
In addition , constructs containing multimerized oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type and mutant AP-1 and Elf-1 sites with intervening nucleotides were cloned into a vector under the direction of the minimal SV 40 promoter and tested for transcriptional activity .
Fig .
7 , A and B shows that the AP-1 and the Elf-1 nuclear protein binding sites were necessary for full activity in stimulated MLA-144 cells both in the context of the endogenous IL-3 promoter ( Fig .
7 A ) and in constructs containing the multimerized DNA segments controlled by the minimal SV40 promoter ( Fig .
7 B ) .
Finally , mutation of the NF-IL-3 site in -319CAT reduced CAT activity by 80 % , demonstrating a role for this site as well .
Interestingly , the reduced CAT activity produced by -319CAT with the NF-IL-3 mutation in comparison to that produced by the wild-type construct is less dramatic when transfected into Jurkat T cells ( data not shown ) .
The studies detailed above demonstrate the requirement of intact AP-1 , Elf-1 , and NF-IL-3 nuclear protein binding sites for inducible IL-3 gene expression .
Human T Cells Contain Multiple Inducible Specific Nuclear Proteins That Bind to DNA Sequences in the IL-3 Promoter .
To investigate the interaction of human T cell nuclear proteins with the 49-bp IL-3 promoter sequence , we performed EMSAs using various oligonucleotide probes and nuclear extracts prepared from uninduced and induced , purified human T cells .
Before extract preparation , a portion of the human T cells was stimulated for 6-8 h with PMA and ionomycin , which induces high levels of IL-3 transcripts ( data not shown ) .
Fig .
8 A shows that multiple complexes were formed with induced T cell extracts and both the AP-1/EIlf-1 ( lane 2 , arrows ) and the AP-1 DNA probes ( lane 4 , arrows ) .
In contrast to EMSA analysis performed using nuclear extracts from unstimulated MLA-144 cells , very little complex formation is evident using uninduced human T cell extracts ( lanes 1 and 3 ) .
However , consistent with results obtained with nuclear extracts prepared from ML A-144 cells , the band pattern seen with human T cell extracts and the AP-1/Elf-1 probe ( lane 2 ) compared with the pattern observed with these extracts and the AP-1 probe ( lane 4 ) is distinct , with fewer and less intense complexes formed with the AP-1 probe .
The specificity of nuclear protein binding of induced T cell nuclear proteins to the AP-1/EIlf-1 DNA subfragment was assessed using unlabeled DNA competitors , as shown in Fig .
8 B .
The two higher mobility bands denoted by closed arrows were specific as demonstrated by competition with wild-type competitor ( lane 2 ) but not by unrelated competitor ( MNIP , lane 5 ) or mutated competitor ( MElf-1 , lane 6 ) .
Clearly , the lowest mobility band denoted by a closed arrow is nonspecific because it is competed by both specific and lL-Gfiomolorjgrﬂgﬁfr_ | cat ii— RELATIVE CAT ACTIVITY ( % ) 25 50 75 100 } ®-C-+ co- pg-C-+ B .

- Functional analysis of three nuclear protein binding sites in the human IL-3 gene .
MLA-144 cells were transfected with a CAT construct under the control of 319 bp of the human IL-3 gene promoter ( A ) or with a CAT construct containing three copies of the AP-1/EIf-1 nuclear protein binding sites found in human IL-3 under the control of the minimal SV40 promoter ( B ) .
CAT constructs with mutations in up to three of the nuclear protein binding sites were also tested .
In addition , 2 ug of pRSV Agal was included in each transfection to normalize efficien-cies .
After transfection , the cells were divided into two groups : one that received PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) and PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) 8 h before harvest and a second group that was incubated with media only .
CAT assays were performed as previously described ( 33 ) .
( A ) Activity of constructs containing mutated nuclear protein binding sites in the context of the endogenous IL-3 promoter .
The mutations were ( AP-1 ) TGAGTCAG to TCTCGAGC , ( ElF-1 ) GGCAGGAAGGG to TGTCTCCTTCG , and ( NF-IL-3 ) ATGAA-TAA to GACTCGAG .
Activity shown is that of stimulated ML A-144 cells only .
Relative CAT activity is that given each construct compared to the activity given by the pCAT vector alone .
Each construct was transfected at least three times and the data shown are from a representative experiment .
( B ) Activity of intact and mutant multimerized AP-1/EIf1 nuclear protein binding sites in constructs under the control of the heterologous minimal SV40 promoter .
The mutations introduced into the AP-1 site were identical to A .
The EIf1 site in this construct was mutated to TGTCTGCTGCC .
Cultures stimulated with PHA/PMA are denoted by { + ) .
Relative CAT activity here represents the activity given by the individual construct in extracts from induced cultures compared to the activity given by the construct in extracts from uninduced cultures .
The uninduced and induced samples were assayed on the same day but run on two thin layer chromatographic plates .
Each construct was transfected three times with different preparations of plasmid DNA and the data presented are representative of one experiment .
nonspecific competitors .
The competitions observed using unlabeled AP-1 and Elf-1 DNA probes are consistent with the pattern seen with MLA-144 nuclear extracts because ( a ) at least one complex is evident in the presence of competitor AP-1 oligonucleotide ( lane 3 , open arrow ) and this band runs A .

Finally , the lowest mobility specific band observed in EMSA reactions with the MLA-144 nuclear extracts does not appear to be present in EMSA reactions conducted with human T cell nuclear extracts .
Discussion IL-3 is a potent inducible hematopoietic growth factor that is produced solely by activated T and NK cells .
In this report , we demonstrated that multiple nuclear protein binding sites are required for T cell-restricted expression of the human IL-3 gene , including sites that bind to AP-1 transcription factors and to Elf-1 , an Ets family transcription factor .
With oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites , we have shown by direct binding and competition that these sites , in fact , bind AP-1 and Elf-1 transcription factors .
In the absence of a DNA subfragment containing the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites , CAT constructs including a segment of the IL-3 promoter/enhancer were active in both T and non-T cells .
In addition , mutation of an element thought to be involved in restricting IL-3 expression , NIP , failed to 1688 Molecular Regulation of the Human IL-3 Gene increase transcription to the level seen with a smaller subfragment when transfected into activated T and non-T cells .
Together , these data support the conclusion that the AP-1/ Elf-1 cassette is critical to cell-restricted and inducible IL-3 gene expression .
The AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites were found to be absolutely required for IL-3 gene expression , because constructs with these sites deleted were inactive in induced T cells .
DNasel footprint and EMSA analyses revealed that the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites as well as intervening DNA bound multiple specific nuclear protein complexes , and there were differences in the mobilities but not the intensities of the complexes observed in EMSAs using extracts from resting or induced MLA-144 cells .
These results suggest that there may be distinct nuclear proteins that bind to the IL-3 promoter in induced and uninduced extracts , or that one or more of these proteins might undergo posttranslational modifications after ac-tivation , or that different protein-protein interactions may exist in resting and induced cells .
Further studies with antisera revealed that both Elf-1 and Jun family binding proteins individually formed complexes with the AP-1/Elf-1 DNA probe .
The presence of proteins that were blocked by Jun family antiserum in extracts from resting MLA-144 cells may be attributed to constitutive expression of Jun and Fos family proteins in these cells .
Evidence for high constitutive expression of JunD , and low but detectable expression of Jun-B , c-Jun , and Fra-1 has been demonstrated in other resting cells ( 45 , 46 ) .
Alternatively , distinct combinations of Jun and Fos proteins may bind to the IL-3 gene during different stages of activation ( 47 ) .
Because it is evident that protein-protein interactions between the various Jun and Fos transcription factors mediate the differential effects observed in regulation of AP-1 proteins ( 30 ) , examination of the individual constituents of the Fos/Jun or Jun/Jun complexes binding to the IL-3 gene AP-1 site in uninduced or induced MLA-144 T cells will be important to elucidate .
Finally , EMSA studies using purified human T cells demonstrated that binding activities were largely limited to extracts prepared from induced cells .
This result is not unexpected , and the demonstration of binding activities in unstimulated MLA-144 cell extracts possibly reflects the transformed state of the ML A-144 cells .
The exact DNA composition of the AP-1 and Ets family nuclear protein binding sites , flanking DNA sequences , and the distance between these sites may determine the fine specificity of nuclear factors that bind to these sites .
Members of the Ets protooncogene family encode transcription factors that bind to purine-rich DNA sequences present in the promoters and enhancers of several cellular and viral genes ( 26 , 33 , 38 , 40 , 49 , 50 ) .
The core GGA sequences are absolutely required for DNA-protein interaction , whereas the flanking sequences determine the specificity of DNA binding by the different Ets family members ( 39 ) .
With respect to the IL-3 gene , examination of the EBS sequence predicts that the IL-3 gene can bind Elf-1 because of a permissive A at nucleotide 8 ( 41 ) .
Whether an Ets family transcriptional protein actually forms a complex with AP-1 dimers or a third protein bridge may depend on the distance separating the two nuclear protein binding sites .
For example , Boise et al .
1689 Gottschalk et al .
( 27 ) have shown that NFAT complex formation requires cooperation between an Ets family factor and AP-1 dimers , and the EBS and AP-1 binding sites in the NFAT motif are 1 bp apart .
Likewise , Wasylyk et al .
( 26 ) demonstrate that the ets-1 protein interacts with AP-1 dimers to activate transcription through the PEA3 motif in the polyoma enhancer .
In the oncogene-responsive domain of the polyoma enhancer , the ets-1 and AP-1 sites overlap by several bases , and analyses using chimeric constructs revealed that maximal levels of activity were possible only when these sites were adjacent ( 48 ) .
In contrast , the Elf-1 and AP-1 nuclear protein binding sites in the IL-3 gene are separated by six nucleotides , and the resulting spatial orientation may account for the observation that these sites can bind to some proteins or protein complexes independently .
Although we have demonstrated the critical importance of the AP-1 and Elf-1 sequences to inducible , T cell-restricted IL-3 gene expression , both AP-1 and Elf-1 transcription factors themselves are found in non-T cells as well as in T cells .
There-fore , the manner in which AP-1 and Elf-1 binding proteins might confer T cell IL-3 specificity is of extreme interest including several possibilities .
First , T cell-specific proteins may interact with the AP-1 or Elf-1 binding factors but not directly with DNA .
Second , there may be yet undefined regulatory protein binding sites and binding factors not detected by DNasel and EMSA analyses .
Finally , the AP-1 and Elf-1 transcription factors may undergo posttranslational modification in vivo leading to T cell-restricted gene expression .
Previous investigators have suggested that two different nuclear protein binding sites , the NF-IL-3 and the NIP sites , may play roles in T cell-specific IL-3 gene expression .
For example , Davies et al .
( 21 ) implicated the NF-IL-3 site ( within the ACT -1 motif ) in IL-3 expression , yet the effect of a mutation in this site is only evident in the context of a construct truncated just 5° to the NF-IL-3 site .
Within a larger construct ( 300 bp of 5 ' flanking DNA ) , the effect of an ACT -1 mutation is negligible ( 21 ) .
In contrast , our data show that mutation of the NF-IL-3 site within the context of 319 bp of 5 flanking sequence dramatically reduces CAT activity as compared to that of the native IL-3 promoter .
There are several possibilities for this discrepancy .
First , the designs of mutant constructs were different .
We mutated specific bases within the NF-IL-3 site , whereas Davies replaced the entire NF-IL-3 site and the 3 ' CRE element with a short DNA spacer ( 15 to 6 bp ) .
Thus , in the latter construct the spatial interactions were dramatically altered and the NF-IL-3 site mutations were not isolated .
In fact , when we tested a construct truncated immediately 3 ' of the NF-IL-3 site , -150CAT ( including the CRE or 3 ' section of ACT -1 ) , this construct gave 50-100 % of the activity given by the larger -175CAT construct .
Thus , Davies ' deletion of the CRE site would be expected to impact greatly on transcriptional activity .
Second , the modes of IL-3 gene induction in the transfected MLA-144 cells were different .
We induced IL-3 gene expression in MLA-144 cells with PHA and PMA , whereas Davies et al .
activated these cells with PMA alone .
Our Northern blot analysis shows that IL-3 transcripts in MLA-144 cells are significantly lower following incubation with PMA in con trast to the levels shown with PHA/PMA stimulation .
There-fore , the effects of mutations in the larger construct described in the other report ( 21 ) may not be evident during low-level IL-3 gene transcription .
Interestingly , our construct with NF-IL-3 site mutations which produced significantly less CAT activity compared to wild-type constructs after transfection into MLA-144 T cells , reduced CAT activity only moderately when tested in Jurkat T cells .
However , the data derived from experiments using Jurkat cells must be carefully assessed because these cells produce extremely low levels of IL-3 .
Two groups have suggested that this lineage-restricted expression is primarily regulated by the NIP element in the IL-3 promoter ( 19-21 ) .
However , mutation of the NIP sequence in the context of -270CAT failed to increase CAT activity to the level observed with the smaller -175CAT .
This implies that another negative regulatory element in addition to or instead of NIP may be involved in repressing IL-3 gene expression .
Alternatively , in the absence of upstream sequences , NIP mutations are unable to restore CAT activity to the levels observed with -150CAT and -175CAT .
In any event , our data do not support a major role for the NIP binding site in the cell specificity of IL-3 gene expression in cells that produce significant quantities of IL-3 mRNA .
Our results are of particular interest in light of recent studies on both the molecular basis of T cell anergy and T cell cytokine deficiency after bone marrow transplantation .
Schwartz and Kong et al .
( 51 , 52 ) have found that antigen-specific anergic T cell clones display profound deficiencies in the binding of AP-1 transcription factors to AP-1 nuclear protein binding sites .
Similar AP-1 nuclear protein deficiencies could well explain the T cell anergy routinely observed following bone marrow transplantation in which T cells arising after transplant fail to secrete either IL-3 or GM-CSF in response to mitogens ( 53 , 54 ) .
Thus , T cell activation via AP-1 and EBS nuclear binding proteins may be a major molecular checkpoint in the expression of the developmental program of T cells in diverse clinical settings .
In summary , these data indicate that 5 '' flanking sequences containing nonadjacent AP-1 and Elf-1 nuclear protein binding sites play a major role in conferring T cell specificity to IL-3 gene expression .
In contrast to the NF-IL-3 and NIP sites , the effects of the AP-1 and Elf-1 binding sites in reporter constructs with flanking IL-3 gene sequences distinguish T cells from non-T cells and are most evident under conditions of T cell activation that maximally stimulate IL-3 production per se .
Future studies identifying the particular members of the Jun family , as well as additional proteins involved in activation at the AP-1 and EIf-1 sites will be extremely interestingly in illuminating the molecular basis of the specificity of T cell cytokine gene expression .
