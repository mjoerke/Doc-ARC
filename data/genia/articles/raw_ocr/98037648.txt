12 Repression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 through the Novel Cooperation of Human Factors YY1 and LSF FABIO ROMERIO , MATTHEW N. GABRIEL , anp DAVID M. MARGOLIS* Institute of Human Virology , Medical Biotechnology Center , University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute , Baltimore , Maryland 21201 Received 7 April 1997/Accepted 20 August 1997 A subpopulation of stably infected CD4* cells capable of producing virus upon stimulation has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -positive individuals ( T.-W.

Few host factors that directly limit HIV-1 transcription and could support this state of nonproductive HIV-1 infection have been described .
YY1 , a widely distributed human transcription factor , is known to inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) transcription and virus production .
LSF ( also known as LBP-1 , UBP , and CP-2 ) has been shown to repress LTR transcription in vitro , but transient expression of LSF has no effect on LTR activity in vivo .
We report that both YY1 and LSF participate in the formation of a complex that recognizes the initiation region of the HIV-1 LTR .
Further , we have found that these factors cooperate in the repression of LTR expression and viral replication .
This cooperative function may account for the divergent effects of LSF previously observed in vitro and in vivo .
Thus , the cooperation of two general cellular transcription factors may allow for the selective downregulation of HIV transcription .
Through this mechanism of gene regulation , YY1 and LSF could contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a population of cells stably but nonproductively infected with HIV-1 .
The paradigm of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) transcriptional activation and virion production following cellular stimulation has been long established .
The nuclear level of several cellular factors , most notably NF-kB , is upregulated following antigen- or lec-tin-induced lymphocyte activation , allowing HIV-1 mRNA expression and successful production of virions .
As few infected , activated CD4 * cells appear to return to the resting state ( 6 ) , little attention has been given to mechanisms that repress HIV transcription and possibly allow some cells to support stable , unproductive infection .
However , the regulation of proviral expression within this reservoir of infected CD4 * cells may assume greater relevance as potent combination antiretroviral therapies deplete HIV from productively infected cell popula-tions .
YY1 is a widely distributed 68-kDa multifunctional transcription factor that directly interacts with many viral and cellular nuclear factors ( 5 , 15 , 24 , 30 ) .
Previously , we demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) that a protein complex present in HeLa nuclear extract binds the HIV-1 LTR initiation region ( -17 to +27 ) and that this complex is specifically depleted by anti- YY1 monoclonal antibod-ies .
Moreover , we found that expression of YY1 inhibited HIV-1 LTR transcription and virion production ( 18 ) .
Further studies of the YYl-containing LTR-binding complex suggested that this might be a multiprotein complex .
Biochemical studies revealed the presence of a second factor that proved to cooperate in function with YY1 .
Three other factors , USF ( 8 ) , LSF ( also known as LBP-1 , UBP-1 , and CP-2 [ 9 , 12 , 14 , 29 ] ) , and TDP-43 ( 19 ) , have been shown to bind the HIV-1 LTR within the -17 to +27 region * Corresponding author .

9375 that is also recognized by YY1 .
LSF ( LBP-1/UBP/CP-2 ) is a ubiquitous factor demonstrated to directly inhibit HIV transcription ( 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 28 ) .
Paradoxically , while LSF can repress HIV transcription in vitro ( 14 ) , transient expression of LSF has no effect on the in vivo activity of the HIV-1 LTR ( 16 , 28 ) .
The function of TDP-43 is unknown , while USF acts as an activator of the HIV-1 LTR ( 8 , 19 ) .
We find that the protein complex that recognizes the HIV-1 LTR initiation region contains a second factor in addition to YY1 .
Further , YY1 cooperates with this factor in inhibition of HIV-1 LTR expression and virus production .
This unique interaction may allow for selective repression of HIV gene expression and could allow some cells to establish stable , nonproductive infection .
The discovery of a selective mechanism of transcriptional repression may lead to targeted approaches to inhibiting HIV gene expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Nuclear extracts .
Large-scale preparation of nuclear extracts from CEM cells for chromatographic purification of the repressor complex sequence ( RCS ) was carried out as described previously ( 7 ) with the following minor modifications : buffers A and C were supplemented with 1 mM NaF , 1 mM Na ; VO4 , 10 mg of leupeptin per ml , 10 ug of aprotinin per ml , and 1 pg of pepstatin A per ml .
Chymostatin ( 1 pg/ml ) was also added to buffer A , and 50 mM B-glycerolphos-phate was added to buffer C. EMSA .
The double stranded oligonucleotides used in this study were LTR ( corresponding to the -17 to +27 region of the HIV-1 LTR ) ; RCS ( -10 to +27 of the HIV-1 LTR ) ; mRCS ( -10 to +27 of the HIV-1 LTR ) , carrying three mutations at positions -1/+1 ( 5-GG-3'-5 '' -CC-3 ' ) , +10/+11 ( 5'-GG-3'-5'-TC-3 ' ) , and +17/+18 ( 5'-CC-3'-5'-GG-3 ' ) ; and P5 , carrying a canonical binding site for YY1 from the -60 region of the adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) P5 promoter ( 24 ) .
All oligonucleotides were end labeled with polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , Mass . )
and [ y-*PJATP .
Purified oligonucleotide probe ( 2 X 10 % cpm ) and 4 ug of nuclear extract or 0.2 pl of affinity chromatography fraction were incubated for 30 min on ice in a buffer containing 12 % glycerol , 12 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 60 mM KCI , 5 mM MgCl , , 4 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 0.6 mM EDTA , 0.6 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , and 10 wM zinc acetate ( final volume , 20 wl ) .
Two micrograms of poly ( dI-dC ) was added to reaction mixtures containing nuclear extract ; 100 ng of poly ( dI-dC ) and 50 ug of bovine serum albumin were added to binding reaction mixtures with purified fractions .

YY1 LTR-binding activity in CEM lymphocytes and U937 monocytoid cells .
The LTR ( -17 to +27 ) probe was incubated with CEM or U937 nuclear extract .
The YY1-specific DNA-protein complex was depleted by the addition of anti-YY1 monoclonal antibody ( « YY1 MAb ) and anti-IgG agarose ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .
The addition of control antibody ( anti-E1A ) and anti-IgG agarose ( lanes 5 and 9 ) or anti-IgG agarose alone ( lanes 3 and 7 ) had no effect .
( 20:1 ) in a buffer containing 12.5 mM Tris-borate and 0.05 mM EDTA .
Competition EMSA was performed with unlabeled RCS , mRCS , or P5 oligonucleotide in the indicated amount .
For experiments using crude nuclear extract , anti- YY1 monoclonal antibody or control monoclonal antibody ( anti-E1A , a gift of Y. Shi ) was added to the EMSA reaction mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4°C .
The antibody-protein-DNA complexes were depleted by the addition of 3 ul of anti-immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) agarose ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo .
) , incubation for 30 min at 4°C , and centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 5 minutes .
The supernatant was recovered and complexes were resolved on a 4 % nondenaturing gel .
For antibody interference EMSA with nuclear extract fractions , 3 mg of purified anti-YY1 rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) , an equivalent amount of rabbit IgG ( Sigma ) , 1 pl of anti-LSF rabbit antiserum , or 1 pl of preimmune rabbit serum was added and the EMSA reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min at 4°C .
Phosphatase experiments .
For phosphatase experiments , EMSA was performed as described above , but nuclear extracts were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence or absence of 1.0 U of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals , Indianapolis , Ind . ) .
Where indicated , 10 mM NaF was added to inhibit phosphatase activity .
The reaction mixtures were then incubated on ice for 30 min with DNA probe and poly ( dI-dC ) and resolved on a 4 % acrylamide gel as described above .
Ion-exchange chromatography .
Activated P11 phosphocellulose ( Whatman , Clifton , N.J. ) was equilibrated with a solution containing 50 mM NaCl , 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 10 % glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) and 0.5 mM DTT .
CEM cell nuclear extract was loaded at 0.4 ml/min , washed , and eluted in a linear gradient of 50 mM to 1 M NaCl .
Fractions shown by Western blotting with anti-YY1 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) to contain YY1 and by EMSA to contain RCS-binding activity were pooled and dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 10 % glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM PMSF , 0.5 mM DTT , and 50 mM NaCl before DEAE-cellulose chromatography .
A DEAE-cellulose DE5S2 column ( Whatman ) was loaded with pooled fractions at 0.2 ml/min .
The column was washed and eluted , and the fractions were analyzed as above .
Fractions positive by both Western blot and gel shift analysis were subjected to further purification by DNA affinity chromatography .
DNA affinity chromatography .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the region -10 to +27 of the HIV-1 LTR was ligated and coupled to CNBr- activated Sepharose CL-4B ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , N.J. ) as previously described ( 13 ) .
Active fractions from DEAE-cellulose chromatography were equilibrated in buffer Z ( 25 mM HEPES [ pH 7.6 ] , 0.1 M NaCl , 20 % glycerol , 12.5 mM MgCl , , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF , and 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 ) .
Affinity resin was washed extensively with buffer Z without glycerol and Nonidet P-40 .
Fractions were incubated for 10 min at 4°C with 10 ag of poly ( dI-dC ) , loaded by gravity , washed , and eluted with a step gradient of 0.1 to 1 M NaCl .
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously ( 2 ) .
Cell lines , transfections , and assays .
CEM and U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and transfected as follows .
Twenty micrograms of plasmid DNA was prepared in 430 pl of distilled water ; 60 pl of a 1 M CaC ] ; solution was added to the DNA .
Five hundred microliters of 2 % HBS solution ( 1 % HEPES , 1.6 % NaCl [ pH 7.08 ] ) and 10 pl of 100 % PO , solution ( 483 mg of Na ; HPO , and 497 mg of NaH ; PO , in 100 ml of distilled water ) were premixed and then added to the DNA-CaCl ; mixture .
After 30 min at room temperature , the solution was added to the cells ( 2.5 x 10° to 4 X 10° cells/plate ) .
Twelve hours after transfection , the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fed fresh medium .
Forty-cight hours later the cells were harvested , cellular extracts were prepared , and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) and B-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described ( 2 , 17 ) .
Luciferase assays were performed as suggested by the manufacturer ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) , but cells were resuspended in 200 pl of lysis buffer and three freeze-thaw steps were performed .
Five micrograms of cellular extract in a final volume of 10 pl was used for luciferase reactions .
To measure transfection efficiency and effects on other promoters , cellular extract was tested for B-galactosidase or luciferase activity .
CAT assays were then normalized for B-galactosidase or luciferase activity .
The control reporter constructs pCH110 , expressing B-galactosidase ( Pharmacia Biotech ) , and pHB-ac-tin-luciferase ( 26 ) , were used in cotransfection .
Where indicated , aliquots of culture medium were sampled for detection of HIV-1 p24*** protein by antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Coulter Corporation , Hialeah , Fla. ) .
ms ( ABC ) -CAT construction .
For CAT reporter assays of HIV-1 LTR unresponsive to YY1 and LSF , a CAT gene was cloned into plasmid ms ( ABC ) ' .
This construct contains mutations that abolish LSF binding to the HIV-1 promoter ( 12 ) , as well as six compensatory mutations that maintain the folding of the TAR Vor .

A mutated RCS probe and a high-affinity YY1 binding sequence do not compete for formation of the YY1-specific complex on the HIV-1 LTR .
When used in EMSA , an mRCS probe carrying three mutations described to prevent the binding of LSF to the HIV-1 LTR ( 12 ) was unable to induce formation of the YY1-specific complex ( lane 11 ) .
In competition experiments , this oligonucleotide failed to compete with the RCS probe for formation of the RCS complex .
The P5 oligonucleotide encoding the canonical YY1 binding site present at position -60 of the AAV P5 promoter ( 24 ) was able to induce the formation of a YY1-specific complex , as indicated by the smaller arrow ( lane 12 ) .
Nevertheless , when used as a competitor this oligonucleotide was unable to inhibit formation of the YY1-specific complex with the RCS probe ( lanes 8 to 10 ) .
stem-loop structure and response to Tat activation ( 23 ) .
BamHI sites were created flanking a CAT gene by PCR amplification .
The CAT gene was then inserted into the BamHI site ( +82 ) of ms ( ABC ) ' , and the promoter and reporter sequences were confirmed .
RESULTS YY1-specific LTR-binding activity in lymphocyte and mono-cyte cell lines .
EMSAs using a -17 to +27 oligonucleotide and nuclear extract from the CD4* lymphocyte cell line CEM or the monocytoid cell line U937 revealed several DNA-protein complexes ( Fig .
1 , lanes 2 and 6 ) .
Treatment with the anti- YY1 monoclonal antibody 1G3 ( a gift of Y. Shi ) specifically depleted the lowest-mobility complex ( Fig .
1 , lanes 4 and 8 ) .
A control antibody ( anti-E1A , a gift of Y. Shi ) or an agarose-conjugated anti-IgG antibody had no effect ( Fig .
1 , lanes 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ) .
For these studies we modified the protocol used to prepare nuclear extracts to minimize protein degradation and dephosphorylation ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Previous studies using HeLa nuclear extract prepared from large batches of cultured cells detected two YY1-specific complexes ( 18 ) .
We detected only one YY1-specific complex in nuclear extracts prepared by a modified protocol from smaller culture volumes of the lymphoid cell lines CEM , Jurkat , and A3.01 , the monocytoid cell line U937 , and primary lymphocyte cell populations ( Fig .
1 and data not shown ) .
We tried to further delimit the sequence necessary for the formation of the LTR-binding complex that contains YY1 .

LSF copurifies with YY1 and the RCS-binding activity .
Equal amounts of the DNA affinity chromatography fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-CP-2 ( LSFe/LBP-1¢ ; a gift of M. Sheffery ) antiserum .
The 0.3 and 0.4 M NaCl fractions were found to contain LSF and to copurify with YY1 and the RCS-binding activity .
Molecular weight markers ( MWM ) are indicated , in thousands .
NEs , unfractionated nuclear extract .
Another factor participates in LTR binding with YY1 .
While the LTR-binding complex we have identified contains YY1 , several observations suggested that this complex might contain additional components and/or a uniquely modified form of YY1 .
First , the lymphoid transcription factor LSF ( LBP-1/UBP/ CP-2 ) has been shown to recognize the same LTR sequence as YY1 ( 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 28 ) .
We found that a triple mutant of the -10/+27 RCS probe very similar to a triple mutant that disrupts LSF binding at this site ( 12 ) was not able to form YY1-specific complexes or compete for their formation ( Fig .
2 , lanes 5 to 7 and 11 ) .
Also , an oligonucleotide encoding the binding site for YY1 from the AAV P5 promoter , a sequence that efficiently binds YY1 ( 24 ) , did not compete for formation of the YY1-specific complex with the RCS probe ( Fig .
2 , lanes 8 to 10 ) .
These results suggest that YY1 binds the HIV-1 LTR with cofactors or is modified in a way that makes it unavailable for binding to the P5 probe .
Further , while purified LSF can repress LTR transcription when tested in vitro ( 14 ) , transfection of LSF expression constructs failed to inhibit transcription in vivo ( 28 ) .
Phosphorylation of LSF has been shown to modulate its DNA binding activity ( 25 ) .
We found that phosphatase treatment of nuclear extract disrupted the formation of the YY1-specific LTR-binding complex ( Fig .
3 ) .
Finally , purified YY1 expressed in E. coli efficiently bound the P5 probe but did not bind the LTR probe in EMSA ( data not shown ) .
This could be due to the absence of a cofactor or proper posttranslational modification of YY1 expressed in Escherichia coli .
These observations led us to hypothesize that LSF and YY1 bind the HIV-1 LTR and function as part of a multiprotein complex .
LSF participates in RCS complex formation .
We sought to identify other components of the YY1-specific LTR-binding complex with a DNA affinity purification strategy .
To delineate components of the RCS-binding complex , CEM nuclear extract was serially fractionated by P11 phosphocellulose ( Fig .
4A ) , DEAE-cellulose ( Fig .
4B ) , and DNA affinity chromatography with a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the RCS ( Fig .
4C ) .
At each step , fractions enriched for RCS-binding activity were identified by EMSA , and the presence of YY1 was assayed by Western blotting .
YY1 and RCS-binding activity copurified in the 0.3 and 0.4 M NaC fractions of the final DNA affinity chromatography step .
RCS-binding activity was enriched approximately 10,000-fold by this procedure .
Western blot analysis showed that LSF copurified with YY1 and the RCS-binding activity in the 0.3 and 0.4 M NaC fractions ( Fig .
5 ) .
TDP-43 , another nuclear protein reported to bind near the RCS site ( 19 ) , was not detected ( data not shown ) .
Since anti-YY1 antibodies ( Fig .
6A ) as well as anti-LSF antisera ( Fig .
6B ) disrupted the formation of the RCS complex , we concluded that both YY1 and LSF participate in RCS complex formation .
Total rabbit IgG , preimmune rabbit se-rum , or irrelevant antibodies such as anti-E1A had no effect on RCS complex formation ( Fig .
6A and B and data not shown ) .
Further , anti- or anti-LSF had no effect on EMSA complexes formed on a Sp1 binding site ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that both YY1 and LSF bind the HIV-1 LTR as part of a multiprotein complex .
YY1 and LSF synergize in repression of HIV-1 LTR expression .
Cooperation in repression of HIV-1 gene expression by YY1 and LSF was demonstrated by cotransfection of HeLa cells with the infectious molecular clone pNL4-3 ( 1 ) and vectors expressing YY1 ( 24 ) and/or LSF ( a gift of Q. Zhu and U. Hansen ) .
As these cells support HIV replication but can not be infected , a measurement of the effects of YY1 and LSF on a single round of viral replication can be made .
The effects of YY1 and LSF on viral production were measured by testing the culture supernatant for the presence of the viral protein p24°* .
In conditions in which transfection of a vector expressing YY1 or LSF produced little inhibition of virion production , cotransfection of both factors synergistically inhibited HIV production ( Fig .
7A ) .
The data shown are representative of three independent experiments .
In a second set of experiments , we tested the effects of YY1 and LSF on the expression of a CAT reporter gene driven by the HIV-1 LTR in the presence of the viral protein Tat .
As previously reported ( 18 ) , YY1 inhibited the basal level of HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT expression .
We found little inhibition of the basal level of LTR expression following cotransfection of LSF ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , Tat-activated , LTR-directed CAT expression was inhibited by YY1 alone and not significantly affected by LSF alone .
However , cotransfection of YY1 and LSF strongly inhibited CAT expression ( Fig .
7B ) .

The RCS-binding complex contains YY1 and LSF .
( A ) EMSA binding reaction with the RCS probe ( -10/+27 ) and 5 ng of DNA affinity chromatography eluate .
Complexes were disrupted by a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the carboxyl-terminal domain of YY1 ( anti-YY1 [ « YY1 ] C-20 ) or a polyclonal antibody directed against the entire molecule ( anti-¥Y1 [ « YY1 ] 1-414 ) but not by an equal amount of total rabbit IgG .
( B ) EMSA binding reaction with the RCS probe and 5 ng of DNA affinity chromatography eluate .
Complexes were disrupted by a rabbit antiserum raised against LSF-c ( anti-CP-2 [ « CP2 ] ) but not by preimmune rabbit scrum .
The results shown are representative of four independent experiments .
In all of these experiments , cell growth , expression of a cotransfected simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) early-driven B-galactosidase reporter and expression of a B-actin promoter-driven luciferase reporter were unaffected by YY1 and LSF ( data not shown ) .
The level of inhibition of LTR-directed CAT expression by YY1 and LSF was similar when CAT assay reaction mixtures were normalized for either SV40 early-driven B-galactosidase activity or B-actin promoter-driven luciferase activity ( data not shown ) .
While LSF is known to activate the SV40 late promoter , it has little effect on the early promoter ( 22 ) .
As YY1 and LSF do not modulate the expression of a broadly active viral promoter or a constitutive cellular promoter , the cooperative repressive effect of these factors appears somewhat selective for the HIV-1 LTR .
The effects of LSF and YY1 can not be attributed to general repression of transcription or nonspe-cific cell toxicity .
Taken together , these data indicate that YY1 and LSF participate in the formation of the RCS-binding complex and cooperatively inhibit virion production by repressing HIV-1 transcription .
Mutations which abolish YY1 and LSF binding abrograte the abilities of YY1 and LSF to repress HIV-1 LTR expression .
To confirm that the negative effects of YY1 and LSF on HIV-1 expression correlated with the abilities of these proteins to recognize the -10/+27 region of the LTR , a CAT reporter gene was inserted downstream of the BamHI site ( +82 ) of plasmid ms ( ABC ) ' .
This construct contains mutations that abolish LSF binding to the HIV-1 promoter ( 12 ) as well as RCS complex formation ( Fig .
2 ) .
ms ( ABC ) ' contains six compensatory mutations that maintain the folding of the TAR stem-loop structure and is defective in the production of short transcripts , but responds to Tat ( 23 ) .
We found that the expression of ms ( ABC ) '-CAT in the presence of Tat was unaffected by the presence of YY1 , LSF , or both factors ( Fig .
8 ) .
DISCUSSION We have described a nuclear protein complex isolated from CEM lymphocytes that binds the initiator region of the HIV-1 LTR .
We have designated the binding site RCS ( for repressor complex sequence ) .
We have shown that two transcription factors , YY1 and LSF , are required for formation of the RCS-binding complex .
Further , YY1 and LSF cooperate in repres-sion , as their coexpression synergistically inhibits LTR-directed gene expression and HIV-1 virion production .

Cooperative repression by YY1 and LSF .
( A ) HeLa cells were transfected with 1.25 ug of HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 and the indicated amounts of expression vector .
Repression mediated by YY1 and LSF was synergistic .
( B ) HeLa cells were transfected with 20 ng of HIV-1 LTR-CAT reporter ( 1 ) , 25 ng of Tat expression vector ( 10 ) , and empty cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) expression vector , CMV-YY1 , or CMV-LSF , as indicated .
As shown , the repression of CAT expression by YY1 and LSF was more than additive .
Percent acetylation is indicated above each lane .
INHIBITION OF HIV-1 BY YYI AND LSF - 9381 YY1 and LSF to cooperate in function has not been previously described .
Our findings suggest that LSF allows YY1 to recognize a site on the LTR that YY1 can not bind by itself .
Anti-YY1 antibodies completely and specifically disrupt RCS complex formation .
However , bacterially expressed YY1 binds weakly to the RCS , suggesting that YY1 of bacterial origin is unable to bind the RCS or that YY1 requires a cofactor for binding .
Previous studies have shown that bacterially expressed LSF as well as LSF purified from nuclear extract can bind an oligonucleotide encompassing the RCS in EMSAs ( 14 , 28 , 29 ) .
Further , anti-LSF antibodies completely and specifically disrupt RCS complex formation .
These observations are consistent with a model in which YY1 participates in RCS complex formation through both direct contact with LSF and a DNA site ( s ) within the RCS .
This model has precedent in YY1 function in other promoters .
The human papillomavirus type 18 URR promoter is regulated by YY1 , but YY1 requires C/EBP-B to cooperatively bind a site in the human papillomavirus promoter not recognized by YY1 alone ( 3 ) .
YY1 can directly repress transcription ; it binds and represses the AAV P5 promoter ( 24 ) .
We suggest that YY1 requires a second protein , LSF , to bind the RCS within the HIV-1 LTR and that binding of the HIV-1 promoter by YY1 and LSF results in repression of transcription .
However , we have not yet demonstrated a direct physical interaction between YY1 and LSF or a biochemical cooperation in binding the RCS .
Therefore , we can not yet exclude other models , such as those involving a third factor .
Studies to explore the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions of YY1 and LSF are underway .
Three transcription factors , USF , LSF ( LBP-1c/UBP-1/CP-2 ) , and TDP-43 , have been shown to bind the HIV-1 LTR within the -17 to +27 region that is also recognized by YY1 ( 8 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 19 , 29 ) .
USF has been shown to activate transcription ( 8 ) .
We were unable to detect TDP-43 in the column fractions containing the RCS-binding activity .
As inhibition of LTR expression is not seen upon the overexpression of LSF in pCMv - ( ug ) 2.5 1.25 1.25 pCMv-YY1 1.25ug - + - + pCMV-LSF 1.25ug i A + + FIG .

Mutations which abolish YY1 and LSF binding abrograte the ability of YY1 and LSF to repress HIV-1 LTR expression .
HeLa cells were transfected with 20 ng of ms ( ABC ) '-CAT reporter , 25 ng of Tat expression vector ( 10 ) , and empty cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) expression vector , CMV-YY1 , or CMV-LSF , as indicated .
As shown , YY1 and LSF had no significant effect on CAT expression .
9382 ROMERIO ET AL .
cells , these observations lead us to speculate that YY1 directly mediates transcriptional repression following its recruitment and/or stabilization within the RCS complex by LSF .
Previously , we reported that YY1 was able to repress the basal level of LTR expression and inhibit HIV-1 virion production ( 18 ) .
We now find that coexpression of YY1 and LSF synergistically inhibits Tat-activated LTR expression and virion production .
Promoter mutations which block RCS complex formation abrogate repression by YY1 and LSF .
These mutations also abolish the function of the inducer of short transcripts ( 23 ) .
However Pessler et al .
have recently reported that neither YY1 nor LSF regulates the function of the inducer of short transcripts , and they attribute that function to a novel factor , FBI-1 ( 21 ) .
The mechanism through which YY1 and LSF repress HIV-1 transcription remains to be studied .
YY1 interacts directly with cellular enhancer factors such as Sp1 ( 15 ) and with other general transcription factors ( 5 ) .
Such interactions may mediate repression by blocking the assembly of a preinitiation transcription complex or by inhibiting the processivity of an assembled complex .
Alternatively or additionally , as the viral activator protein Tat can interact with the TATA-binding protein and can induce phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II , YY1 and LSF may inhibit these putative activating functions of Tat .
Finally , several groups have recently reported that histone acetylation may result in transcriptional repression ( 20 ) .
YY1 may act by bringing a histone acetylase to the promoter and inducing an inhibitory modulation of chromatin structure ( 27 ) .
Repression by YY1 and LSF appears to some degree to be selective for the HIV-1 promoter .
Under conditions that significantly inhibited LTR expression , coexpression of YY1 and LSF did not significantly affect the activity of a promiscuous viral promoter ( SV40 early ) or of a constitutive cellular promoter ( B-actin ) .
While other cellular processes are likely to be affected by YY1 and LSF , the unique cooperation of these factors may allow specificity in the negative regulation of HIV-1 LTR expression .
It is attractive to speculate that YY1 and LSF participate in cellular pathways opposing those signals that activate lymphocytes , induce IL-2 expression , upregulate NF-kB , and promote HIV-1 replication .
