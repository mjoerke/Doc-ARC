Activation of the transcription factor MEF2C by the MAP kinase p38 in inflammation J. Han , Y. Jiang , Z. Li , V. V. Kravchenko & R. J. Ulevitch Department of Immunology , The Scripps Research Institute , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , California 92037 , USA For cells of the innate immune system to mount a host defence response to infection , they must recognize products of microbial pathogens such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , the endotoxin secreted by Gram-negative bacteria ' .
These cellular responses require intracellular signalling pathways , such as the four MAP kinase ( MAPK ) pathways '' .
In mammalian cells the MAPK p38 is thought to play an important role in the regulation of cellular responses during infection through its effects on the expression of proinflammatory molecules ' .
One means of understanding the role of p38 in these responses is to identify proteins with functions regulated by p38-catalysed phosphorylation .
Here we demonstrate a link between the p38 pathway and a member of the myocyte-enhancer factor 2 ( MEF2 ) group of transcription factors .
We found that in monocytic cells , LPS increases the transactivation activity of MEF2C '' '' ~ '' through p38-catalysed phosphorylation .
One consequence of MEF2C activation is increased c-jun gene transcription .
Our results show that p38 may influence host defence and inflammation by maintaining the balance of c-Jun protein consumed during infection .
We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with p38 .
Because active kinase-substrate interactions may be transient , we used a kinase-inactive mutant of p38 to favour the formation of stable protein-protein complexes '' .
We used as targets two constructs of p38 that were produced by fusing the cDNA of the p38 coding region ( wtp38 ) or a p38 mutant with the TGY dual phosphorylation site mutated to AGF ( TY mutant ) to the carboxy 296 terminus of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pAS1 vector '' .
A human fetal brain cDNA library fused with the GAL4 activation domain placed in the pGAD1IO was screened using the two p38 constructs .
By screening 10 '' transformants we identified five positive clones which interacted with the TY mutant ; in contrast , no clones were obtained when wtp38 was used in the screen .
To address the specificity of these interactions a mating experiment was performed in which the cDNAs from the five clones were transfected into strain ¥190 .
The resultant cells were mated with strain Y187 transfected with seven different cDNAs ( Fig .
la ) fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pASl vector , Only the cells expressing the p38 TY mutant and the five test clones displayed positive galactosidase activity .
Sequencing showed that each clone encoded different regions of the same protein , namely , myocyte enhancer factor 2C ( MEF2C ) , a transcription factor belonging to the MADS superfamily `` .
MEFZC has three alternatively spliced exons of which the first was found in all our clones while alternatively spliced exons two or three were absent in other clones ( Fig .
1b ) .
The MEF2C used for subsequent experiments lacks alternatively spliced exon three .
There are four members of MEF2 gene family , MEF2A-D `` , but the interaction with p38 seems to be selective for MEF2C , as no other members of this family have been isolated by two-hybrid screening even though the cDNAs encoding these other proteins are in the brain library ( data not shown ) .
To show that wtp38 and MEF2C interact , glutathione-agarose , with or without bound recombinant GST-wtp38 , was incubated with varying amounts of recombinant MEF2C in the presence or absence of ATP .
Immunoblotting revealed saturable binding of MEF2C to GST-wtp38-agarose but not to GST-agarose ( Fig .
lc , bottom ) .
The binding of MEF2C to p38 was not detected when a large excess of cold ATP was included ( Fig .
1¢ , bottom , last lane ) .
Phosphorylation of MEF2C was detected by the inclusion of P-ATP in the incubation mixtures ( results not shown ) .
Taken together these data show that MEF2C and wtp38 interact , and that the stability of this interaction is reduced after phosphorylation of MEFC .
To determine whether other MAPKs can phosphorylate MEF2C we compared the activity of recombinant p38 and two other MAP kinase family members , ERK2 and JNK1 , towards MEF2C ( Fig .
1d ) .

NATURE !
VOL 386120 MARCH 1997 MEF2C is indeed a preferred substrate of p38 ; not unexpectedly , other substrate preferences were observed for ERK2 or JNK1 ( Fig .
1d ) .
Quantification of MEF2C phosphorylation showed that p38 is 16-fold more active than ERK2 and 100-fold more active than JNK1 ; the relative enzyme activities were normalized using MBP .
MEF2C transcripts have previously been reported to be enriched in skeletal muscle , spleen and brain ' '' ~ '' .
By using RNase protection assays with a MEF2C probe corresponding to bases 404-695 , we | observed mRNA expression in primary monocytes , in monocyte- like cell lines THP-1 and U937 , and in the B-cell line Akata , but not in HepG2 cells ( Fig .
2a ) .
MEF2C has been reported to bind to AT-rich DNA sequences present in promoters of a variety of genes '' '' .
To evaluate whether activation of monocytic cells with LPS influences proteins in nuclear extracts that bind to a MEF2 site , an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using oligonu- letters to nature cleotides encoding a MEF2 binding site ' '' .
Treating RAW 264.7 cells with LPS resulted in a time-dependent increase in MEF2-site binding activity , reaching a maximum 1h after stimulation with LPS ( Fig .
2b ) .
This binding activity can be competed with the oligonucleotide containing a MEF2 site but not a mutated MEF2 site .
To investigate further how p38 regulates MEF2C we used a modified form of MEFZC in which the MADS and MEF2 domains were deleted , with the remainder of the protein containing a transactivation domain '' fused to the DNA-binding domain of yeast transcription factor GAL4 .
This fusion protein will bind to GAL4 DNA-binding sites and can be used to study interactions between p38 and MEF2C without complications from the effects of other endogenous proteins .

e , The influence of the mutation of phosphorylation sites of MEF2C on MEFZC-dependent reporter gene expression .
Mutations at the phosphorylation sites of MEFZC reduced MKKSBb ( E } - or LPS-enhanced MEF2C-dependent reporter gene expression. , 297 letters to nature luciferase reporter gene containing five copies of a GAL4-binding site upstream of a minimal promoter ( 5XGAL4-luc ) and a GAL4-MEF2C expression plasmid .
LPS treatment increased the expression of the GAL4-MEF2C-dependent reporter gene in both cell lines ( Fig .
2¢ , d ) .
Co-transfection of a constitutively active p38 activator , MKK6b '' , also increased luciferase expression in THP-1 ( Fig .
2¢ ) and RAW 264.7 cells ( data not shown ) .
MKK6b { ( E ) seems to be a stronger activator than LPS , perhaps because LPS activates p38 only transiently , whereas activation by MKK6b { ( E ) is continuous .
This idea is supported by the observation that stimulation with LPS of cells already expressing MKK6b { ( E ) , GAL4-MEF2C and a reporter gene failed to increase luciferase activity ( data not shown ) .
The addition of the p38 inhibitor FHPT '' ° reduced reporter gene expression induced by LPS or MKK6b ( E ) in THP-1 cells ( Fig .
2¢ ) .
Expression of dominant-negative p38 with a mutation in the ATP binding site ( Lys 53 to Met ) also inhibited LPS-induced enhancement in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
2d ) ; dominant-negative p38 also blocked MKK6b ( EB ) -induced luciferase activity ( data not shown ) .
An in-gel kinase assay '' using recombinant MEF2C as substrate showed that p38 is the major kinase in lysates from LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells that is responsible for phosphorylation of MEF2C ( Fig .
2e ) .
Treatment of recombinant MEF2C with p38 in vitro followed by phosphoamino-acid analysis indicated that p38 can phosphorylate both serine and threonine residues of MEF2C ( Fig .
3a ) .
Further studies were performed using phosphopeptide mapping strategies to identify the exact sequences phosphorylated '' ( Fig .
3b ) .
By analysing the electrical charge and the mass of all the tryptic peptides of MEF2C ' '' '' , we have predicted the sequences of the two phosphopeptides of MEF2C in Fig .
3b that seem to be targeted by p38 .
We observed that peptide 1 had a higher level of phosphorylation than peptide 2 .
Because MAP kinases favour sites containing proline , we believe that Thr 293 and Thr 300 in peptide 1 and Ser 387 in peptide 2 are phosphorylated by p38 ( Fig .
3b ) .
These two threonines are the logical candidates for phosphorylation sites because p38 phosphorylates MEF2C on both threonine and serine residues ( Fig .
3a ) , and Thr 293 and Thr 300 are the only threonine residues followed by a proline in MEF2C .
Thr 293 and Thr 300 are located in a previously identified transactivation domain of MEF2C '' .
To establish whether these sites are phosphorylated after treatment with LPS , and to investigate whether their phosphorylation results in regulation of MEF2C transactivation activity , we created a mutant of GAL4-MEF2C in which Thr 293 and Thr 300 , Ser 387 , were mutated to alanine .

( 3 M ) inhibited LPS ( 10 ng ml~ ' , 40 min } -induced c-Jun transcription , as determined by northern blotting analysis .
298 fected RAW 264.7 cells and selected stable transfectants .
Phosphorylation of the GAL4-MEF2C fusion proteins was detected using in vivo labelling with *P-orthophosphate followed by stimulation with LPS , which induced phosphorylation of GAL4-MEF2C fusion proteins ; the induced phosphorylation was reduced when Thr 293 , Thr 300 or Ser 387 was mutated to alanine ( Fig .
3¢ ) .
Peptide mapping ( see Fig .
3d ) revealed that the inducible phosphorylation occurred on two peptides identical to those shown in Fig .
3b .
The Ser 387 mutation led to loss of inducible phosphorylation of peptide 2 , whereas inducible phosphorylation of peptide 1 was prevented by using the GAL4-MEFZC with mutations of Thr 293 and Thr 300 ( Fig .
3d ) .
These data are consistent with the idea that p38 is important in the LPS-induced phosphorylation of MEF2C , as the phosphorylation sites identified in these whole-cell studies are the same as those observed from in vitro phosphorylation studies .
To determine whether the phosphorylation of MEF2C controls its transactivation activity , a reporter gene assay was performed .
The Thr 293 and Thr 300 and Ser 387 mutants are not activated by the coexpression of MKK6b { ( E ) or the addition of LPS , but a control Ser 240 mutant behaved identically to native MEF2C ( Fig .
3€ ) .
Analysis of the promoters of many LPS-inducible genes revealed a MEF2C site in the c-Jun promoter that was previously suggested to be involved in serum-induced c-Jun expression ' '' .
To determine the role of this MEF2 site and p38 activation in LPS induced c-Jun gene expression we used the constructs pJluc , with the luciferase gene driven by the c-Jun promoter ( - 225 to +150 base pairs ) , and pJSXluc , which contains a mutated MEF2 site '' .
LPS stimulation or MKK6b { E ) expression increased c-Jun promoter activity ( Fig .
4a ) .
Mutation of the MEF2 site in the c-Jun promoter dramatically reduced the induction of reporter-gene expression by either LPS stimulation or by expression of MKK6b ( E ) , Thus the MEF2 site plays an important role in LPS-induced c-Jun expression .
We next overexpressed MEF2C in RAW 264.7 cells .
Overexpression of MEF2C inhibited LPS-induced c-Jun reporter expression in a dose-dependent manner , which suggests that MEF2C homo-dimers exert a negative regulatory effect as a result of competition with MEF2C heterodimer ( s ) that are likely to enhance gene transcription .
This interpretation was further supported by results showing that expression of MEFZC with mutations of either Thr 293 and Thr 300 or at Ser 387 had a much stronger inhibitory effect ( Fig .
4b ) because their expression not only increases the homodimer formation but also results in the formation of defective hetero-dimers .
Inhibition of p38 activity by FHPI also markedly inhibited LPS-induced c-Jun mRNA expression ( ~65 % ) ( Fig .
4¢c ) .
These data support the idea that MEFZC participates in LPS-induced c-Jun expression through p38-induced phosphorylation .
We know of no data that directly link MEF2C activation to expression of cytokine genes , such as that for tumour necrosis factor .
However , p38-enhanced c-Jun expression might contribute to LPS-induced changes in AP-1 or the AP-1/CRE-like element binding activity in monocytic cells '' '' , as the modulation of these DNA-binding activities by LPS requires de novo protein synthesis* '' .
Cytokine genes typically have AP-1/CRE-like ele-ments .
Thus , for infection with multiple exposures to microbial pathogens such as LPS , MEF2C activation might play an important role in controlling the balance of cytokine production through its effects on c-Jun expression .
It has also been shown that stimulation with LPS leads to the activation of JNK and the subsequent phosphorylation of c-Jun '' .
Thus LPS activation results in consumption of c-Jun protein , and p38-induced MEF2C activation results in increased transcription of the c-Jun gene , which itself would result in the replenishment of c-Jun protein .
Because p38 and JNK are also quite often activated together by important phlogistic stimuli such as interleukin-1 or tumour necrosis factor , these two MAP kinase pathways may also be linked during many conditions in which inflammatory responses are upregulated .

Direct observation of the rotation of F , -ATPase Hiroyuki Noji* , Ryohei Yasuda , Masasuke Yoshida* & Kazuhiko Kinosita Jri * Research Laboratory of Resources Utilization , Tokyo Institute of Technology , Nagatsuta 4259 , Midori-ku , Yokohama 226 , Japan t Department of Physics , Faculty of Science and Technology , Keio University , Cells employ a variety of linear motors , such as myosin ' ~ , kinesin ' and RNA polymerase '' , which move along and exert force on a filamentous structure .
But only one rotary motor has been investigated in detail , the bacterial flagellum® ( a complex of about 100 protein molecules ' ) , We now show that a single molecule of F ; -ATPase acts as a rotary motor , the smallest known , by direct observation of its motion .
A central rotor of radius ~1 nm , formed by its y-subunit , turns in a stator barrel of radius ~5nm formed by three « - and three B-subunits ' .
F ; -ATPase , together with the membrane-embedded proton-conduct-ing unit F , , forms the H*-ATP synthase that reversibly couples transmembrane proton flow to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis in respiring and photosynthetic cells '' '' .
It has been suggested that the y-subunit of F ; -ATPase rotates within the « B-hexamer '' , a conjecture supported by structural , biochemical'* '' and spectroscopic '' studies .
We attached a fluorescent actin filament to the y-subunit as a marker , which enabled us to observe this motion directly .
In the presence of ATP , the filament rotated for more than 100 revolutions in an anticlockwise direction when viewed from the 'membrane ' side .
The rotary torque produced reached more than 40 pN nm ~ ' under high load .
In the crystal structure of mitochondrial Fi-ATPase® , rigid '' coiled-coil « -helices of the y-subunit penetrate the central cavity of the and extend into the stalk region that links F ; -ATPase to the F , portion .
The amino terminus of the B-subunits is on the side opposite the stalk region of the y-subunit .
To fix the a ; B3y subcomplex on a glass plate , the subcomplex derived from a thermophilic bacterium was expressed in Escherichia coli , with ten histidines ( His tag ) linked to the N terminus of each B-subunit .
