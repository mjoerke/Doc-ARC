Béatrice Kunz and Werner Held* Members of the Ly-49 gene family code for class I MHC-specific receptors that regulate NK cell function .
Due to a combinatorial distribution of Ly-49 receptors , NK cells display considerable clonal heterogeneity .
The acquisition of one Ly-49 receptor , Ly-49A is strictly dependent on the transcriptional trans-acting factor T cell-specific factor-1 ( TCF-1 ) .
Indeed , TCF-1 binds to two sites in the Ly-49a promoter and regulates its activity , suggesting that the Ly-49a gene is a direct TCF-1 target .
TCF-1 deficiency resulted in the altered usage of additional Ly-49 receptors .
We show in this study , using TCF-1 B ; , -microglobulin double-deficient mice , that these repertoire alterations are not due to Ly-49/MHC class I interactions .
Our findings rather suggest a TCF-1-dependent , cell autonomous effect on the acquisition of multiple Ly-49 receptors .
Besides reduced receptor usage ( Ly-49A and D ) , we also observed no effect ( Ly-49C ) and significantly expanded ( Ly-49G and I ) receptor usage in the absence of TCF-1 .
These effects did not in all cases correlate with the presence of TCF binding sites in the respective proximal promoter .
Therefore , besides TCF-1 binding to the proximal promoter , Ly-49 acquisition may also be regulated by TCF-1 binding to more distant cis-acting elements and/or by regulating the expression of additional trans-acting factors .
Consistent with the observed differential , positive or negative role of TCF-1 for Ly-49 receptor acquisition , reporter gene assays revealed the presence of an inducing as well as a repressing TCF site in certain proximal Ly-49 promoters .
These findings reveal an important role of TCF-1 for the formation of the NK cell receptor repertoire .

This receptor fam- ily includes both activating and inhibitory receptors that are specific for classical MHC class I molecules .
The expression of inhibitory receptors prevents NK cells from attacking normal cells and enables them to detect autologous MHC class I loss variants .
These receptors are thus important to maintain NK cell tolerance toward normal cells and to ensure reactivity toward aberrant cells .
The role of activating Ly-49 receptors is less well known .
Members of the Ly-49 receptor family are highly homologous ( 59-91 % ) , except Ly-49B , which is more distantly related ( 1 , 2 ) .
Six family members were shown to recognize classical MHC class I molecules using functional and/or cell-cell adhesion assays .
Although some Ly-49 receptors exhibit rather broad MHC class I cross-reactivity ( e.g. , Ly-49A , C , and 1 ) , others ( Ly-49E , F , and G2 ) bind selectively to certain MHC class I alleles ( 3 ) .
Inhibitory Ly-49 receptors contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in their cytoplasmic domain , which are required to trans-duce the inhibitory signal .
Two family members ( Ly-49D and H ) lack this motif .
Upon engagement of MHC ligand and/or receptor cross-linking using mAbs , these receptors are able to activate NK cells via associated DAP-12 adaptor molecules ( 4-6 ) .

E-mail address : wheld @ isrec.unil.ch Copyright © 2001 by The American Association of Immunologists The genes encoding Ly-49 family receptors are tightly clustered in the NK complex on mouse chromosome 6 ( 7 , 8 ) .
To date , 10 Ly-49 genes have been shown to give rise to complete mRNAs in C57BL/6 mice .
The expression of Ly-49 receptors is restricted to NK cells , NK T cells , and occasional conventional CD8 * T cells ( 9 ) .
In contrast to other multigene families , like MHC class I or II , the expression of Ly-49 genes is not coregulated .
Individual Ly-49 receptors are expressed by partially overlapping subpopulations of 10-50 % of peripheral NK cells ( 9 ) .
Ly-49B and Ly-49E receptors are expressed only by occasional ( < 2 % ) NK cells based on single cell RT-PCR analysis ( 10 ) .
Therefore , NK cells display some , but not all , of the available Ly-49 receptors ( 10 ) , whereby receptor expression usually occurs from a single allele ( 11 , 12 ) .
Indeed , coexpression of inhibitory Ly-49 receptors is detected at frequencies that are expected when the receptors are expressed independently and coexpression coincides ( 12-14 ) .
Ly-49 receptors are acquired during NK cell development , and the bone marrow environment seems to play an important role in inducing Ly-49 receptor expression ( 15 , 16 ) .
During development , Ly-49 receptors are acquired in an ordered fashion , one Ly-49 receptor at a time ( 17-19 ) .
At each stage , NK cells acquire a particular receptor in an all or none fashion .
Once acquired , the patterns of Ly-49 expression in NK cells are stably maintained also through cell division ( 18 , 20 ) .
In contrast , extinction of Ly-49 expression seems to occur in NK T cells to allow their maturation ( 21 ) .
To obtain insights into the process of Ly-49 receptor distribu-tion , we have begun to investigate the control over Ly-49 gene expression .
We have previously shown that the Ly-49a promoter contains two sites for transcriptional trans-acting factors such as T cell factor-1 ( TCF-1 ) , '' denoted TCF sites I and II .

Indeed , the acquisition of the Ly-49A receptor in vivo is strictly dependent on TCE-1 based on the analysis of TCF-1-deficient mice ( 22 ) .
These findings suggested that TCF-1 binding to the Ly-49a promoter is a critical event for Ly-49A acquisition during NK cell development .
TCF-1 was discovered based on its binding to certain lympho-cyte-specific enhancers .
Although TCF-1 and related factors of the TCF lymphoid enhancer factor ( LEF ) family ( which includes TCF-1 , -3 , -4 , and LEF-1 in mammals ) have no transactivation capacity on binding site multimers , they acquire the ability to activate transcription upon the association with B-catenin ( 23 , 24 ) .
TCF/B-catenin complexes are formed transiently in response to wingless/wint signaling and mediate the expression of TCF-depen-dent target genes ( 23-26 ) .
In the absence of B-catenin , TCFs act as transcriptional repressors due to their association with Groucho-related proteins ( 27 ) .
In the context of genes that are constitutively expressed , TCF-1 ( and its homologue LEF-1 ) plays an architectural role independent of B-catenin binding ( 28 , 29 ) .
For instance , the minimal TCRa enhancer is regulated by the TCP/LEF-induced , context-dependent assembly of a higher order nucleo-protein complex ( 30 ) .
Similarly , Ly-49a promoter activity in a T cell line was regulated by TCF-1 in the absence of B-catenin binding ( 22 ) .
In contrast to Ly-49A usage , other members of the Ly-49 receptor family were not stringently dependent on TCF-1 ( 22 ) .
Nev-ertheless , the sizes of most Ly-49-defined NK cell subsets were altered in TCF-1-deficient mice .
In this study , we have assessed the Ly-49 receptor repertoire in TCF-1/B , -microglobulin ( B , m ) double-deficient mice to rule out the possibility that these alterations are due to Ly-49/MHC class I interaction .
The data suggest that TCF-1 positively regulates the acquisition of Ly-49A and D , and depresses Ly-49G and I , while Ly-49C is not affected .
These findings suggest a dual role for TCF-1 in the formation of the NK cell receptor repertoire .
They are discussed in the context of the structure and function of the proximal promoter region of the respective Ly-49 genes .
Materials and Methods Mice C57BL/6 ( B6 ) ( H-2 '' ) and B10.D2 ( H-2 '' ) were purchased from Harlan Olac ( Horst , The Netherlands ) .
B , m-deficient B6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) .
TCF-1 exon VII knockout and Ly-49A transgenic mice have been described ( 31 , 32 ) .
All mice used in this study were homozygous for a B6-derived NK gene complex .
This was initially ascertained by Southern blot analysis to detect an RFLP in the Ly-49a gene between 129Sv and B6 mouse strains ( EcoRI-digested genomic DNA hybridized with a Ly-494 cDNA probe ) .
In addition , the B6 origin of receptors encoded in the NK gene complex was ascertained using flow cytometry with B6 allele-specific mAbs Al ( Ly-49A ) and PK136 ( NK1.1 ) .
TCF-1-deficient B , m-deficient , H-2 '' '' or Ly-49A transgenic mice were obtained by back-crossing to the respective strains and intercrossing .
Appropriate offspring was identified using flow cytometry with mAbs specific for H-2D '' ( KH-95 ) , H-2D % ( 34.2.12 ) ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) , or Ly-49A ( JR9-318 ) .
Experimental mice were 8-12 wk old .
Flow cytometry Spleen cell suspensions were passed over nylon wool columns .
One million nonadherent cells were incubated with 24G2 ( anti-CD16/32 ) hybridoma supernatant to reduce background .
Cells were stained with a mixture of NK1.1 PE and CD3 cychrome plus appropriate combinations of FITC- or biotin-labeled anti-Ly-49 mAbs : SW5E6 ( Ly-49C/D ; 4D11 ( Ly-49G ) , 4E5 ( Ly-49D ) ( all from PharMingen ) , JR9-318 ( Ly-49A ) ( 33 ) , and 4L03911 ( Ly-49C ) ( 34 ) .
EL-4 T cell lymphoma cells were stained with FITC-la-beled Ly-49 mAbs ( listed above ) and propidium iodide to exclude dead cells .
In general , 5 X 10 % live cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software for data evaluation ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .

A second sense primer at the Psfl site of Ly-49a is indicated in boldface in Fig .

These two primers were used individually in conjunction with gene-specific antisense primers specific for -untranslated regions of different Ly-49 cDNAs .
The sequence complementary to the primers is indicated in boldface in Fig .
3 .
The Ly-49a fragment was derived from clone 9-1 ( 35 ) .
PCR was performed in a total volume of 30 pul using 100 ng of B6-derived tail DNA , 300 nM of each primer , and 1.5 U of AmpliTaq in 1 % buffer supplied by the manufacturer ( Roche Diagnostics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) .
Conditions for PCR were 5 min at 92°C , then 40 cycles of 1 min at 92°C , 1 min at 55°C , 1 min at 72°C , and finally 5 min at 72°C .
Amplification products were gel purified and cloned using the TA cloning kit ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) .
To control for PCR and sequencing errors , three or more independent clones were completely sequenced on both strands .
The antisense PCR primers were chosen to yield amplification products derived from specific Ly-49 genes and to include known cDNA sequence .
This allowed the assignment of upstream sequences to given Ly-49 cDNAs .
Because very little sequence information was available for Ly-49d exon I , we have used the amplified genomic Ly-49d sequence to design an additional sense primer .
This primer was used then used in conjunction with a Ly-49d-specific primer ( 36 ) on B6 NK cell cDNA templates to obtain additional 5'-untranslated Ly-49d cDNA sequence .
This amplification product was cloned and sequenced .
It matched the Ly-49d cDNA and confirmed the correct upstream sequence of the Ly-49d gene .
PCR products were obtained with Ly-49a ( Xbal ( -362 ) ) together with the above antisense primers , except for Ly-49¢ , for which only a shorter fragment was amplified using the sense primer Ly-49a ( Psfl ( -177 ) ) .
An additional sense primer ( Ly-49a ( EcoRI ( -1066 ) ) further upstream did not yield any amplification products .
Moreover , no specific amplification products were obtained for Ly-49e and Ly-49h .
The Ly-49a sequence ( accession L13874 ) was previously reported ( 35 ) .
The sequences described in this report are accessible at GenBank : Ly-49c ( AYO26327 ) , Ly-49d ( AYO26324 ) , Ly-49f ( AYO26325 ) , Ly-49g ( AY026323 ) , and Ly-49i ( AYO26326 ) .
They were initially aligned with Sequencher ( Gene Codes , Ann Arbor , MI ) .
Portions of the alignment were manually adjusted to accommodate gaps .
5'-rapid amplification of cDNA end ( 5'-RACE ) The 5 ' end of Ly-49 cDNAs was determined using 5-RACE .
Total cellular RNA was isolated from IL-2-activated NK cells using TRIzol ( Gibco BRL , Basel , Switzerland ) .
cDNA was prepared using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Roche ) and oligo ( dT ( 12-18 ) ) as primer ( Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
Tailing of the 5 '' cDNA end and nested PCR was performed using the 5'-RACE kit ( Roche Diagnostics ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
For first-round PCR Ly-49 gene-specific antisense primers are described previously ( 36 ) , and for the second round PCR the specific primers are indicated in Fig .
3 ( boldface ) .
PCR products were cloned using the TA cloning kit ( Invitrogen ) , and multiple independent clones were sequenced to determine the cDNA end .
Bent arrows in Fig .

These correspond to three of four clones for Ly-49g ( one clone ended ~50 nt more 3 '' ) , three of five ( 5 ' arrow ) and two of five ( 3'arrow ) for Ly-49d , and two of three for Ly-49¢ ( one clone ended ~50 nt more 3 ' ) .

Ten million cells were electroporated with 5 ug of the luc plasmid or a promoter-less luc construct .
One microgram of a SV40 promoter green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) plasmid was included to control for the transfection effi-ciency .
After 36 h , the cells were analyzed for GFP expression using flow cytometry or lysed to measure luc activity ( Promega , Walliselleu , Switzerland ) .
Specific reporter gene activation was determined relative to a promoter-less luc construct .
Values were normalized to the percentage of GFP* cells , as determined by flow cytometry .
Results Ly-49 receptor usage in TCF-1-deficient mice lacking MHC class I molecules Besides the striking effect on Ly-49A , we have previously observed additional , but more subtle alterations of Ly-49 receptor usage in TCF-1-deficient mice ( 22 ) .
To rule out the possibility that the NK cell receptor repertoire in these mice was skewed based on Ly-49/MHC class I interactions , we generated double-deficient mice , which lack TCF-1 as well as class I MHC molecules ( due to the targeted disruption of the Bam gene ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , in the absence of class I MHC molecules , the Ly-49 receptor repertoire of TCF-1* and TCF-1~ mice was significantly different .
The frequency of Ly-49A-expressing NK cells was reduced ~10- to 20-fold in Tef-I mutant as compared with wild-type mice ( Fig .
14 ) .
In contrast , Ly-49C/I-expressing NK cells ( identified by mAb 5B6 ) were significantly more abundant in the absence of TCF-1 .
This , together with the observation that the Ly-49C subset ( identified by mAb 4L0431 ) was not significantly altered , suggests a positive effect on Ly-49I usage in the absence of TCF-1 .
Similarly , Ly-49G usage was increased , while the NK cell subset defined by the activating Ly-49D receptor was reduced ~3-fold in the absence of TCF-1 ( Fig .
1B ) .
Therefore , in the absence of MHC class I molecules , TCF-1 deficiency results in positive and negative effects on Ly-49 receptor usage .
To test whether it is the absence of TCF-1 or of Ly-49A that is responsible for the altered representation of the remaining Ly-49 receptors , we have generated Ly-49A transgenic , TCF-1-deficient mice .
Transgene expression did not significantly alter endogenous Ly-49 usage in TCF-1-deficient mice ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the Ly-49 receptor repertoire is skewed due to TCF-1 , and not indirectly due to Ly-49A deficiency .
Finally , NK cells seem to express distinct Ly-49 receptors in-dependently , based on the observation that the extent of receptor coexpression fits well with coincident coexpression ( 13 , 14 ) .
Even though the sizes of individual Ly-49-defined NK cell subsets are significantly altered in TCF-1-deficient mice , coexpression of Ly-49 receptors was still observed at the expected frequencies , which indicate independent regulation of Ly-49 receptors ( Fig .
1C and data not shown ) .
Therefore , the lack of Ly-49A acquisition from the endogenous locus does not per se affect the acquisition of other Ly-49 receptors , and the lack of TCF-1 does not globally alter Ly-49 coexpression patterns .
Collectively , these findings suggest that TCP-1 independently affects the acquisition of multiple Ly-49 receptors during NK cell development .
Isolation and analysis of Ly-49 promoter regions We have previously shown that the TCF-1 dependence of Ly-49A acquisition correlated with the presence of two TCF binding sites in the proximal Ly-49a promoter ( 22 ) .

The alignment of Ly-49a with the novel sequences revealed three patterns ( Fig .
3 ) .
First , Ly-49a-like sequences include Ly-49c and Ly-49g .
These sequences contain two consensus TCF-1 binding sites ( CTTTGA/TA/T ) that are referred to as TCF I and II .
Second , Ly-49c-like sequences ( including Ly-49c¢ , Ly-49f , and Ly-497 ) are characterized by a 20-bp deletion that comprises in its center and consequently eliminates TCF site II .
TCF site I is retained in Ly49i and Ly-49f , but mutant in Ly-49c .
Third , the Ly-49d upstream region resembles Ly-49a ( ie. , it contains the above 20-bp se-quence ) ; however , both consensus TCF sites are mutant ( Fig .
3 , and schematic representation in Fig .
4 ) .
Because Ly-49D usage is significantly reduced in TCF-1-deficient mice , these latter findings suggest that TCF-1-dependent effects may also be indirect ( ie. , based on deregulated expression of additional transcription fac-tors ) or be exerted by TCF-1 binding to cis-acting elements that are located elsewhere in the gene .

Ly-49i cDNAs extended into the TATA box region ; however , this analysis may have been biased for such products because the primer covered the major initiation site present in other Ly-49 genes .
The data are compatible with the presence of a TATA-like ( ATAAAA ) core promoter element in Ly-49a and Ly-49g ; however , the remaining Ly-49 promoters appear to be TATA-less .
Moreover , the upstream sequences reported in this work do indeed contain promoter elements .
Regulation of Ly-49 promoters by TCF site II To delineate a role for TCF binding sites that are located in proximal Ly-49 promoters , we have first compared the activity of the different Ly-49 promoters using reporter gene assays in the Ly-49A-expressing T cell lymphoma EL-4 .
Preliminary experiments indicated that the ~400-bp ( Xbal-EcoRV ) Ly-49a promoter fragment was sufficient to confer efficient reporter gene activation in EL-4 cells ( data not shown ) .
Similar to Ly-49a , the Ly-49g upstream regions conferred robust ( 30-fold ) reporter gene activation in EL-4 T cells , but not in control A20 B cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast , reporter gene activation by the Ly-49f ( 10-fold ) and Ly-49i ( 3-fold ) promoters was considerably less efficient , while Ly-49d was completely inactive ( Fig .
2 ) .
Therefore , the functional differences in reporter gene assays seem to reflect structural differences in Ly-49 promoters .
The presence of TCF site II in proximal promoters correlated with efficient reporter gene activation ( Fig .
4 ) .
Indeed , point mutations in TCF site II significantly reduced Ly-49a promoter activity ( 22 ) .
Natural promoters such as Ly-49c¢ , Ly-49i , and Ly-49f lack TCF site II due to a 20-bp deletion .
To further address the importance of TCF site II , the respective 20 bp was deleted from the Ly-49a promoter .
This deletion resulted in a considerably reduced activity of the Ly-49a promoter ( ~4-fold ) ( Fig .
5 ) .
In a reciprocal experiment , we tested whether TCF site II was able to restore strong reporter gene activation by a Ly-49 promoter that lacked it .
To this end , we introduced the 20 bp of the Ly-49a promoter-containing TCF site II into Ly-49f .
Indeed , the Ly-49f insertion construct conferred efficient reporter gene activation in EL-4 cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
The presence of the 20-bp stretch is thus nec- 6185 Ly49a Ly49f Ly49f ins II -- -- - [ } - [ } -= 0 _ 10 20 30 40 50 Fold specific activation FIGURE 5 .

essary for efficient Ly-49 promoter activity in EL-4 cells , suggesting that TCF site II can significantly contribute to the activity of Ly-49 promoters .
Regulation of Ly-49 promoters by TCF site I NK cells expressing certain Ly-49 receptors were overrepresented in the absence of TCF-1 , raising the possibility that TCP-1 can inhibit Ly-49 acquisition .
Because the Ly-49i promoter contains a single consensus TCF site ( Figs .
3 and 4 ) , we hypothesized that TCE-1 binding to this site was inhibitory .
To address this , we took advantage of a modified Ly-49a promoter , in which the 20 bp surrounding TCF site II were deleted and that had retained residual activity ( Fig .
5 ) .
Reporter gene activation by this construct was compared with the corresponding construct in which TCF site I was mutated .
Control experiments using EMSA assays ensured that the mutation of TCF site I abrogated the binding of rTCF-1 ( 22 ) or nuclear extract from EL-4 cells ( data not shown ) .
Indeed , the construct with the mutant TCF site I displayed significantly higher reporter gene activation in EL-4 cells compared with the construct with a wild-type TCF site I ( > 2-fold increase ) ( Fig .
6 ) .
To ensure that the inhibition by TCF site I was true for natural Ly-49 promoters , the respective site was also mutated in the Ly-49f and Ly-49i promoters .
Again , the TCF site I mutant Ly-49f promoter was significantly more effective in reporter gene assays than its wild-type counterpart ( ~4-fold ) ( Fig .
6 ) .
Ly-49i activity was not increased upon the elimination of TCF site I ( Fig .
6 ) .
Indeed , Ly-49i activity ( of 129/ ] origin ) may be repressed in EL-4 cells by sequences upstream of the Psfl site ( 37 ) .
Our data thus provide evidence that in the absence of TCF II , TCF site I can negatively influence Ly-49 promoter function .
Therefore , the functional studies using EL-4 cells revealed the potential of two cis-acting elements in proximal Ly-49 promoters , TCF sites II and I , to influence promoter function in a positive or a negative fashion , respectively .
In extension , they may help to explain why TCE-1 deficiency can influence Ly-49 receptor acquisition in both positive and negative ways .
Discussion We show in this study that in the absence of MHC class I expres-sion , the lack of TCE-1 results in contracted ( Ly-49A and Ly-49D ) , expanded ( Ly-49I and Ly-49G ) , or unaltered ( Ly-49C ) NK 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6186 TCF X P HI V Ly49a In yon , bul LO ) el Ly49a HUE I \n on mme amman Ly49a del II RAF—lqz-DO—l Ly49a del II mut 1 Ly49f mﬂ— Ly49f mut I - =-=_ -- -- = -- -- -Ly49i q—v-D— Ly49i mut | - =n -- n m 0 5 Fold specific activation 10 15 20 25 FIGURE 6 .

cell subsets expressing Ly-49 receptors .
Additional experiments suggest that these effects are unrelated to the absence of Ly-49A protein or the failure to express the endogenous Ly-49a locus .
The failure to acquire Ly-49A is indeed due to the lack of TCF-1 in the NK cells themselves , and not environment in which these develop ( 22 ) .
The TCF-1-dependent effects on Ly-49 usage are not readily mirrored by the gene order in the Ly-49 cluster ( Ly-49d-//- Ly-49i- Ly-49g-//-Ly-49c- Ly-49a ) ( 7 , 8 ) ) .
They seem also unrelated to the presumed order in which these receptors are acquired during NK cell development ( A-G- > C/I-D ) ( 5 , 17 , 18 ) .
Our findings suggest that TCP-1 deficiency results in a cell autonomous defect , which independently perturbs the acquisition of multiple Ly-49 receptors .
Based on the TCF-1 dependence of Ly-49A acquisition in vivo , together with the presence of two consensus TCF sites in the proximal Ly-49a promoter , which bind TCF-1 and regulate promoter function ( 22 ) , we have isolated and analyzed additional Ly-49 promoters .
Indeed , inhibitory Ly-49 receptors that displayed an altered usage in TCF-1-deficient mice contained at least one TCF binding site .
Surprisingly , however , no consensus TCF binding site was present in the proximal Ly-49d promoter , while Ly-49D usage was clearly reduced in the absence of TCF-1 in vivo .
Therefore , in addition to a direct action of TCF-1 on proximal promoters , as suggested for Ly-49a , we have to consider the possibility that TCF-1-dependent effects may also be exerted by TCF-1 binding to cis-acting elements that are located elsewhere in the gene .
In addition , it is possible that TCF-1-dependent effects may be indirect , i.e. , based on deregulated expression of additional transcription factors .
There is indeed some evidence that the regulation of activating Ly-49 receptors may differ from their inhibitory counterparts .
Activating Ly-49 receptors are not expressed in NK T cells , and the extent of their coexpression deviates from the predicted value that indicates independent expression ( 5 , 38 ) .
Whatever the precise TCF-1 target , Ly-49 promoters seem to control important aspects of Ly-49 gene expression .
The activity of the Ly-49a promoter strictly correlated with endogenous Ly-49A usage in cell lines ( 22 ) .
Moreover , the expression of Ly-49A and G by EL-4 cells correlated with the efficient activity of the respective ( but not other ) promoters .
The promoter may thus be important to control tissue specificity of Ly-49 expression .
The functional studies also revealed an important role of TCF binding sites TCF-1 DEPENDENCE OF THE Ly-49 RECEPTOR REPERTOIRE to regulate Ly-49 promoter function .
Site II was required for efficient function of proximal Ly-49 promoters ( Fig .
5 ) .
Notably , this site was absent in three Ly-49 promoters due to a 20-bp deletion .
This deletion removes exactly two turns of the DNA helix , leaving trans-acting factors bound adjacent to this site in phase , yet bringing them into proximity .
Interestingly , that is the proposed role of TCE/LEF factors in the TCRa enhancer : DNA binding induces a bend in the DNA helix , which brings proteins bound to sites surrounding TCF/LEF sites into proximity ( 30 ) .
In the absence of TCF II due to a 20-bp deletion , we observed that the remaining TCF site I repressed promoter function ( Fig .
6 ) .
The deletion of TCF II seemed to be important for the repressing function of TCF I .
The latter site failed to repress in the presence of TCF II or in its absence due to the introduction of point mutations ( Fig .
6 ) ( 22 ) .
These findings demonstrate that distinct TCF sites can modulate promoter function in a positive or negative fashion .
However , the precise role of TCF sites is influenced by their context .
In extension , the data help to explain why TCE-1 is required for the acquisition of certain Ly-49 receptors , while it suppresses others .
Although these findings illustrate the principle , there remain differences between the in vitro and in vivo data ( see below ) .
Perhaps these arise because transient transfections reveal the architectural function of TCE-1 .
The role of TCF-1 during Ly-49 receptor acquisition may be to make chromatin accessible and to allow additional transcription factors to bind the promoter ( 39 ) .
The dual role of TCFs has become apparent in cell fate determination during Xenopus and Drosophila development .
Target gene induction is mediated by the wnt-dependent association of TCFs with B-catenin ( 23 , 24 ) .
In the absence of wnt signals and consequently intracellular free B-catenin , target gene expression is repressed via the interaction of TCFs with Groucho-related proteins ( 27 ) , CBP ( 40 ) , or NEMO-like kinase ( 41 ) .
It will thus be important to determine whether Ly-49 receptor acquisition is influenced by TCF cofactors .
Like Ly-49a , the Ly-49g promoter contained two TCF sites ( Fig .
3 ) .
However , unlike Ly-49A , Ly-49G usage was increased in TCE-1-deficient mice ( Fig .
1 ) .
Because preliminary experiments indicate that Ly-49g promoter activity is also dependent in part on TCF site II ( not shown ) , it is possible that in the absence of TCF-1 , Ly-49G acquisition is ensured by another trans-acting factor that can bind TCF sites , such as LEF-1 .
Indeed , TCF-1 and LEF-1 have identical DNA-binding specificity and LEF-1 can substitute for TCF-1 to mediate TCRa enhancer function ( 42 ) .
We are thus currently testing whether in addition to TCF-1 , LEF-1 is playing a role for the formation of the Ly-49 receptor repertoire .
In addition , one of the differences between the Ly-49a and Ly-49g promoter sequences may affect ATF-2 binding to the Ly-49g promoter .
In the Ly-49a promoter , ATF-2 binds a nonconsensus cAMP-responsive element and regulates promoter activity ( 43 ) .
Because the TCF site I and the ATF-2 binding site in the Ly-49a promoter overlap partially ( see Fig .
3 ) , it is possible that ATF-2 binding can prevent TCF-1 binding to the inhibitory site I in the Ly-49a , but not the Ly-49g promoter .
In this way , TCE-1 might be able to depress Ly-49G , but not Ly-49A usage .
Promoter diversity and the formation of the Ly-49 receptor repertoire When considering only the presence/absence of the two consensus TCFE-binding motifs , we find four different configurations among the six Ly-49 promoters ( see Fig .
2 and schematic representation in Fig .
3 ) , demonstrating considerable heterogeneity among Ly-49 promoters .
The implication of TCE-1 suggests a role for additional factors for Ly-49 promoter function and/or the developmentally regulated Ly-49 acquisition process .
As pointed out above , TCF-1 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology has no transactivation capacity by itself .
In the minimal TCRa enhancer , TCF-1 and its homologue LEF-1 function in collaboration with additional transcription factors of the ets , cAMP response element-binding protein , and core binding factor families ( 28 , 30 , 44 ) .
The fact that Ly-49 promoter sequences ( and relevant elements therein ) display diversity provides circumstantial evidence that differential Ly-49 receptor expression in NK cells may be mediated via the differential yet partially conserved presence and occupancy of protein-binding sites in Ly-49 promoters .
Therefore , distinct Ly-49 genes may be controlled by partially overlapping sets of DNA-binding factors .
Ly-49 receptor acquisition during NK cell development may occur when an appropriate factor complex forms at a given promoter .
The formation of this complex would be required to initiate Ly-49 receptor expression in an all or none fashion .
That event may occur with a low probability , accounting for the relatively low rate of Ly-49 receptor acquisition during NK cell development .
We propose that TCF-1 influences positively or negatively the formation of this putative complex at Ly-49 promoters .
Note added in proof .
The sequence assigned here to Ly-49i corresponds to Ly-49j ( 45 ) .
The Ly-49i sequence has the same configuration of TCE/LEF sites as Ly-49j .
