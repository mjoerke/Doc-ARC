Tax expression promotes N-terminal phosphorylation and degradation of a principal cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-KB .
Our studies now demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax activates the recently identified cellular kinases IB kinase « ( IKKa ) and IKK , which normally phosphorylate IxBa on both of its N-terminal regulatory serines in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha ( INF- « ) and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) stimulation .
In contrast , a mutant of Tax termed M22 , which does not induce NF-KB , fails to activate either IKKa « or IKKB .
Furthermore , endogenous IKK enzymatic activity was significantly elevated in HTLV-1-infected and Tax-expressing T-cell lines .
Transfection of kinase-deficient mutants of IKKa « and IKKB into either human Jurkat T or 293 cells also inhibits reporter gene expression induced by Tax .
Similarly , a kinase-deficient mutant of NIK ( NF-KB-inducing kinase ) , which represents an upstream kinase in the TNF- « and IL-1 signaling pathways leading to IKKa and IKKf activation , blocks Tax induction of NF-KB .
However , plasma membrane-proximal elements in these proinflammatory cytokine pathways are apparently not involved since dominant negative mutants of the TRAF2 and TRAF6 adaptors , which effectively block signaling through the cytoplasmic tails of the TNF-a @ and IL-1 receptors , respectively , do not inhibit Tax induction of NF-KB .
Together , these studies demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax exploits a distal part of the proinflammatory cytokine signaling cascade leading to induction of NF-KB .
The pathological alteration of this cytokine pathway leading to NF-KB activation by Tax may play a central role in HTLV-1-mediated transformation of human T cells , clinically manifested as the adult T-cell leukemia .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) represents the first pathogenic human retrovirus identified ( 49 , 78 ) .
After a long latency period , approximately 0.05 to 0.1 % of individuals infected with this retrovirus develop an often aggressive and fatal proliferation of activated CD3 ¢ CD4 * T cells , termed adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) ( 66 ) .
HTLV-1 has also been etiologically linked with a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( 13 , 46 ) .
HTLV-1 encodes a 40-kDa regulatory protein termed Tax that appears to play a central role in cell transformation ( 18 , 36 , 50 , 58 , 64 , 74 ) .
Although Tax does not bind directly to DNA , it alters the activity of several host transcription factors , notably cyclic AMP responsive element ( CRE ) binding protein ( CREB ) /activating transcription factor ( ATF ) , serum response factor ( SRF ) , and NF-kB/Rel ( 79 ) .
Tax-induced transactiva-tion of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is mediated through the CREB/ATF pathway ( 5 , 15 , 63 ) .
In this response , Tax participates in the formation of a ternary complex that includes the viral CREs and CREB , appears to enhance CREB * Corresponding author : Mailing address : Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology , P.O .

5157 dimerization , and stabilizes CREB binding to the CREs ( 3 , 6 , 48 , 63 , 69 , 81 ) .
Additionally , the indirectly tethered Tax protein facilitates recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein ( CBP ) , through an interplay with the KIX domain of CBP ( 16 , 28 , 76 ) .
Tax also modulates transcription of various cellular genes , some of which may be involved in T-cell transformation ( 19 , 57 , 77 , 79 ) .
Many of these genes are regulated by members of the NF- « B/Re ! l family of transcription factors .
For example , Tax induces various cytokines and the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor « -chain gene via the NF- « B pathway ( 19 , 57 , 77 ) .
Tax also induces the c-fos oncogene through SRF ( 11 , 12 ) .
Of note , Tax induction of the CREB/ATF , SRF , and NF- « B/Rel pathways is selectively impaired by the introduction of site directed mutations into Tax ( 36 , 55 , 56 , 74 ) .
For example , the M22 mutant of Tax ( T1308 L131 ) retains CREB/ATF-stimulatory activity but is strongly impaired in its ability to activate NF-kB ( 56 ) .
These findings raise the possibility that different subre-gion domains of Tax mediate the activation of these various host transcription factor pathways .
The precise role of each of these pathways in Tax-induced cellular transformation remains unresolved ( 36 , 58 , 74 ) .
The prototypical NF- « kB complex corresponds to a hetero-dimer of the p50 ( NFKB1 ) and RelA ( p65 ) members of the NF-kB/Rel family of transcription factors ( 1 , 2 , 68 ) .
Other 5158 GELEZIUNAS ET AL .
factors in this family include RelB , c-Rel , and p52 ( NFKB2 ) .
Prior to activation , NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its physical interaction with a set of inhibitors termed the IxBs ( IxBa , IxBB , and IxBg ) , p105 and p100 ( NFKB2 ) ( 1 , 2 , 68 ) .
Stimulation of the cell with proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNF- « ] and interleukin-1 [ IL-1 ] ) , phorbol esters , lipopolysaccharide , and several other activators leads to the phosphorylation of IkBa on two N-terminal serine residues located at positions 32 and 36 .
This posttranslational modification targets the inhibitor for rapid ubiquitination and degradation within the 268 proteasome .
The proteolysis of cytoplasmic IxBa allows nuclear translocation of NF-kB ( 1 , 2 , 68 ) .
How cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kB by the p100 and p105 inhibitors is relieved remains largely unknown .
The molecular basis for Tax induction of NF-kB has been a topic of extensive investigation .
Tax has been reported to interact physically with many members of the family ( 2 , 21 , 79 ) but appears to display highest affinity for the p100 product of the NFKB2 gene ( 4 , 26 , 31 , 44 ) .
The amino terminus of p100 , which contains p52 and its Rel homology domain , appears to mediate this interaction ( 4 , 26 , 44 ) .
Expression of Tax has also been reported to overcome the cytoplasmic sequestration property of p100 and p105 , permitting the release and nuclear translocation of NF- « B ( 26 , 43 , 44 ) .
However , a convincing series of studies has shown that Tax promotes the phosphorylation and degradation of both IxBa and IxBB , suggesting that this HTLV-1 regulatory protein may induce nuclear translocation of NF- « B by acting prior to or at the level of IKB phosphorylation ( 7 , 17 , 24 , 29 , 39 , 62 ) .
This notion is further strengthened by the finding that degradation-resistant IxBa mutants lacking the two N-terminal serine phosphorylation sites effectively block Tax-induced « B-dependent transcription ( 7 , 25 ) .
Together , these findings suggest that Tax may coopt a signaling pathway that leads to IxB phosphoryla-tion .
Three cellular kinases involved in TNF- « and IL-1 induction of NF-kB have recently been identified .
These include the NF-kB-inducing kinase ( NIK ) , a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase ( MAP3K ) -related kinase that associates with various TNF receptor ( TNFR ) -associated factors ( TRAFs ) and corresponds to a strong inducer of NF-kB .
When rendered catalytically inactive , NIK functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF- « - and IL-1-induced NF-kB activation ( 35 , 59 ) .
However , NIK does not directly phosphorylate the IKBs but instead associates with and activates ( 51 ) the recently recognized IxB kinase a ( IKKa ) ( 10 , 40 , 51 ) , previously designated the conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase ( 9 ) .
IKKa « has been shown to phosphorylate both N-terminal serines of IxBa and preferentially serine 23 of IxBB ( 10 , 39 , 50 ) .
A second related IKB kinase , termed IKK $ , has also been isolated and characterized ( 40 , 72 , 80 ) .
This enzyme phosphorylates the regulatory serines of both IxBa and IxBB .
These « and B IKKs can form hetero- and homodimers ( 40 , 72 , 80 ) via their leucine zipper domains , although heterodimers appear to be favored in vivo .
The studies described in this report were aimed at identifying the cellular signaling intermediates involved in HTLV-1 Tax induction of nuclear NF- « B expression .
We demonstrate that Tax activates the enzymatic activity of ectopically expressed IKKa and IKKB and that the enzymatic activity of endogenous IKKs is elevated in HTLV-1-infected and Tax-expressing T-cell lines .
In addition , we report that kinase-deficient versions of NIK , IKKa , and IKKS effectively block Tax action .
In contrast , based on the use of dominant negative mutants , Tax induction of NF-kB does not appear to involve Mor .

the TRAFZ2 and TRAF6 adaptor proteins which represent more proximal components of the TNFa and IL-1 signaling pathways .
These findings suggest that distal components of the proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway are selectively co-opted by Tax , leading to the activation of NF-kB .

RESULTS Signaling pathways leading to JNK and NF-KB activation .
A summary of the recognized signaling pathways leading to NF- « B and c-Jun activation is schematically presented in Fig .
1 .
TRAFZ and TRAF6 represent proximal signaling intermediates that are recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of the type 1 TNFR ( TNFR1 ) and the type 1 IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R1 ) , respectively , following ligand binding ( 8 , 22 ) .
TRAF2 is recruited through an interaction with TRADD , while TRAF6 appears to associate with MyD88 and IRAK ( IL-1 R-associated kinase ) ( 8 , 22 , 45 , 71 ) .
Both of these TRAFs are capable of engaging NIK , a MAP3K-related kinase , which thus forms a nexus in these two proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathways leading to NF-kB activation ( 35 , 59 ) .
In turn , NIK associates with and activates IKKa and -B ( 51 , 72 ) .
The IKKs phosphorylate the IxBs on two N-terminal serine residues ( 10 , 40 , 51 , 72 , 80 ) , leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of these inhibitors in the 268 proteasome ( 1 , 2 , 68 ) .
MEKK1 corresponds to a second MAP3K that forms a key signaling intermediate in the TNFR1 pathway leading to JNK activation .
MEKK1 is also capable of activating NF- « B when ectopically expressed , but its role in TNF- « induction of this transcription factor remains controversial ( 20 , 32 , 34 , 59 ) .
PAK1 corresponds to a kinase that is activated by small GTPases of the Rho family that has also been shown to activate JNK ( 27 ) .
The precise involvement of PAK1 in these signaling pathways is not yet clear .
Finally , pp90 ' '' is a phorbol ester-activated kinase , positioned downstream of the extracellular response kinases ( ERKs ) ( 60 ) , that has been shown to directly phosphorylate IxBa on serine 32 in vitro and to induce degradation of this inhibitor ( 14 , 54 ) .
We have explored the participation of several of these signaling components in the HTLV-1 Tax response leading to induction .
The IxBa $ $ 32/36AA mutant blocks HTLV-1 Tax induction of NF-B in 293 cells .
As a starting point in our studies , we verified that a constitutive repressor mutant of IxBa ( the S§32/ 36AA mutant ) , in which serines 32 and 36 were substituted with alanines , effectively blocked Tax induction of xB-depen- Tax INDUCTION OF NF- « B INVOLVES IKKe AND IKKB - 5159 dent luciferase activity in human 293 cells .
These cells were cotransfected with a Tax expression vector and increasing amounts of the IxBa S§32/36AA mutant ( 25 to 400 ng of expression plasmid [ Fig .
2AJ ) .
In these cells , the IxBa S§32/ 36AA mutant functioned as a potent inhibitor of Tax-induced NF-kB expression .
This finding confirms for 293 cells the results of prior studies performed with different cell types ( 7 , 25 ) and suggests that Tax activates NF-kB by entering a signaling pathway prior to or at the level of IxBa .

Functional analysis of the roles of IKKa and IKKB in HTLV-1 Tax induction of NF-xB .
( A ) IxBa mutant HA-IkBae $ §32/36AA , which fails to undergo stimulus-coupled phosphorylation and degradation , blocks Tax activation of NF- « B in human 293 cells .
Cells were transfected with 1 ug of Tax expression vector , 200 ng of xB-TATA-luciferase , 20 ng of 6RZ ( -galactosidase reporter ) , and 25 , 100 , or 400 ng of HA-IxBa $ $ 32/36AA .
The total DNA concentration was held constant at 4 pg by supplementation with the parental pCMV4 vector .
To control for differences in transfection efficiency , luciferase activity was normalized to B-galactosidase activity .
The results presented represent the means ( + standard deviations ) derived from at least three independent transfections .
All values were first calculated as fold induction relative to cells transfected with reporter plasmids only .
These values were then expressed as percentages of the response obtained with Tax alone .

Functional effects of kinase-deficient IKKe and IKKB mutants on HTLV-1 Tax induction of NF- « B in human Jurkat T cells .
Cells were transfected by using DMRIE-C with 350 ng of Tax , 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1 ug of the K44M mutant of IKKa-T7 or the K44A mutant of IKKB-FLAG , and 500 ng of either the « B-luciferase or the HTLV-1 LTR luciferase reporter plasmid .
Each transfection also contained 250 ng of 6RZ and was supplemented to 4.25 pg of DNA with a pCMV4-based CD8 expression vector .
Luciferase results were normalized to B-galactosidase activity , expressed as fold induction relative to cells transfected with reporters only and finally as a percentage of the HTLV-1 Tax response .
( K44A ) on Tax-induced NF-kB expression were next assessed in 293 cells .
Since the wild-type IKKs were included as controls for their kinase-deficient mutant counterparts , the functional effects of wild-type IKKa and IKKS were first evaluated ( Fig .
2B ) .
IKKa produced only a twofold increase in « kB-luciferase activity at the highest dose of expression vector ( 400 ng ) , while IKKS mediated a sevenfold increase in luciferase activity at the same dose of expression vector ( 400 ng ) .
The addition of increasing amounts of either the IKKa ( KA44M ) or IKKS ( KA44A ) kinase-deficient expression vector produced a dose-dependent suppression of the Tax response ( Fig .
2C ) .
In contrast , addition of increasing amounts of the wild-type IKKa and IKKf expression vectors did not inhibit the Tax response and in some cases produced a slight amplification of the response .
Immunoblotting of the cell lysates confirmed the presence of comparable levels of Tax protein expression in each of the transfection conditions ( Fig .
2C , inset ) , eliminating suppressive effects of the IKKa and IKK kinase-deficient mutants on Tax expression as the cause of the observed inhibition .
Kinase-deficient IKKa and IKK mutants inhibit HTLV-1 Tax-mediated activation of NF-KB in Jurkat T cells .
Since HTLV-1 preferentially infects human T cells , which in some cases leads to ATL , the effects of the kinase-deficient mutants of IKKa and IKKB on Tax induction of xB-luciferase activity were evaluated in human Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
As a control for these experiments , the effects of these IKK mutants on Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-1 LTR , which involves the CREB/ATF rather than NF- « B/Re ! l family of transcription factors , was evaluated in parallel .
Transfection of escalating doses ( 0.1 , 0.3 , and 1 ug ) of the expression vectors encoding either IKKa ( KA44M ) or IKKB ( K44A ) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of Tax activation of xB-luciferase activity ( Fig .
3 ) .
In contrast , over these same doses , the kinase-deficient IKK mutants produced no significant inhibition of Tax-induced HTLV-1 LTR luciferase activity .
These results suggest that Tax induction of NF- « B in human Jurkat T cells , as in 293 cells , involves the participation of IKKa and IKK .
HTLV-1 Tax activates IKKa and IKKRB enzymatic activity .
To independently assess whether HTLV-1 Tax induction of NF-kB proceeds through IKKa and IKKB , we examined whether Tax , like TNF- « , stimulates the enzymatic activity of IKKa and IKKS ( Fig .
4 ) .
We chose to perform these experiments with HeLa cells because of a failure to observe induction of IKK enzymatic activity by either Tax or TNF- « in 293 cells .

This result most likely reflects a high constitutive enzymatic activity due to overexpression of these kinases .
Thus , HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding either IKKa or IKK and wild-type Tax or the M22 mutant of Tax .
M22 Tax fails to induce NF- « xB expression ; however , it continues to activate the HTLV-1 LTR via the CREB/ATF pathway , indicating that it is not completely misfolded ( 55 ) .
As an additional control , selected cell aliquots were stimulated with TNF-a for 10 min .
Kinase activity for IKKa ( Fig .
4A ) and IKKS ( Fig .
4B ) was assessed in in vitro kinase assays involving immunoprecipitation of the kinases and the addition of recombinant GST-IxBo ( 1-62 ) as an exogenous substrate .
As shown in Fig .
4A and B , wild-type Tax , like TNF- « , but not M22 Tax activated the enzymatic activity of the IKKa and IKKS proteins .
The levels of immunoprecipitated IKKa and IKKB , as well as the levels of Tax in the cell lysates , in each transfection condition are also shown .
Of note , the M22 Tax mutant was consistently expressed at lower levels than wild-type Tax ; however , when comparable levels of protein expression were examined ( for example , wild-type Tax at 0.1 wg and M22 Tax at A B & ® C °§Q°5 % Q2\QQ ( 3 $ 0 N $ §3PQ roS - puras Y pka « P C\ AA « IPS $ « e Pox x `` x ' x ¢¢lxex x o. alie -C GST-IxBo- » » Wi we om GST-IxBa ( 1-62 ) ( 1-62 ) IKKo-HA -- « « - I E A 8 - S -Tax- i wa -- Tax- 5 & C ( sq D a & A 4 C 6 } a « 0+ 7,6 ” & F & & « & ¢ y » & ¢ y GST-IxBa ( 1-62 ) ~ « - < » IKKO/IKKB - « ous cas -- - am- wan cme Tax - coum ques muz FIG .

HTLV-1 Tax activates ectopically expressed and endogenous IKKa and IKKB enzymatic activity .
( A ) Approximately 4 X 10° Hela cells were transfected with 1 ug of IKKa-HA expression plasmid and various amounts of wild-type ( WT ) Tax ( 0.3 or 1 ug ) or M22 Tax ( 3 or 1 ug ) expression vector .
As a control , cells transfected with IKKa-HA only were stimulated with medium or TNF-a ( 20 ng/m ! )
for 10 min .
Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and subjected to in vitro kinase assay in the presence of GST-IxBa ( 1-62 ) as an exogenous substrate .
Levels of immunoprecipitated IKKa-HA and levels of wild-type and M22 Tax present in the cell lysates are also shown .
( B ) Approximately 10 '' HeLa cells were transfected with 900 ng of IKKB-FLAG expression plasmid and either 1.8 mg of wild-type Tax or 5.4 pg of M22 Tax expression vector .
Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assay in the presence of GST-IxBa ( 1-62 ) as an exogenous substrate .
Levels of immunoprecipitated IKKB-FLAG and levels of wild-type and M22 Tax present in the lysates are also shown .
In vitro kinase assays were performed on endogenous IKKa/B immunoprecipitated with antibody H744 , which cross-reacts with both enzymes .
GST-IxBa ( 1-62 ) fusion protein was added as an exogenous substrate , and activities were compared for unstimulated and TNF- « ( 20 ng/ml for 30 min ) -induced Jurkat E6-1 cells and HTLV-1-infected HUT102 and C8166 T cells ( C ) or Jurkat T cells stably transfected with a sense ( Jurkat-Tax ) or antisense ( Jurkat-anti-Tax ) expression vector ( D ) .
Levels of H744-immunoprecipitated endogenous IKKo/B proteins and levels of Tax in the cell lysates are also shown .
Vou .
18 , 1998 1 ug ) , wild-type Tax significantly activated the enzymatic activity of IKKa compared with the M22 Tax mutant ( Fig .
4A ) .
Similarly , when 1.8 pg of wild-type Tax was compared to 5.4 ug of M22 Tax , a significant induction in IKK enzymatic activity was observed in response to Tax expression ( Fig .
4B ) .
Utilization of a GST -IxBa substrate containing alanine substitutions for serine at positions 32 and 36 demonstrated that the measured Tax response involved phosphorylation at the two N-terminal serine residues of IkxBa ( data not shown ) .
Together , these findings demonstrate that like the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a , HTLV-1 Tax , but not M22 Tax , augments the enzymatic activity of both IKKa and IKK .
Endogenous IKKs are enzymatically more active in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and Jurkat T cells expressing Tax .
To assess whether Tax also activates the endogenous IKKa and IKKS enzymes , we analyzed the HTLV-1-infected HUT102 or C8166 T-cell lines and Jurkat T cells engineered to stably express Tax or antisense Tax ( 70 ) .
Endogenous IKKa and IKKB were immunoprecipitated from these cells with antibody H744 , which cross-reacts with both enzymes , and analyzed in an in vitro kinase assay ( Fig .
4C ) .
Although somewhat less IKKa/B was immunoprecipitated from HUT102 and C8166 cells than from Jurkat E6-1 cells , both HTLV-1l-infected cell lines displayed significantly higher levels of endogenous IKKa/B enzymatic activity .
Indeed these levels of activity exceeded that obtained in Jurkat E6-1 cells stimulated with TNF-a .
While the HUT102 and C8166 cells expressed large amounts of Tax ( Fig .
4C ) , it was possible that other differences in these cells from Jurkat T cells were responsible for the altered IKKa/B activity .
Accordingly , we compared Jurkat-Tax and Jurkat-anti-Tax cell lines , which are identical except for the presence of Tax ( 70 ) .
Although expressing comparable amounts of IKKa/B , the Jurkat-Tax cells displayed moderately increased IKKa/B enzymatic activity relative to the Jurkat-anti-Tax cell line ( Fig .
4D ) .
The small increase in IKK activity paralleled the relatively low level of Tax expression observed in the Jurkat-Tax cells ( Fig .
4D ) .
These results demonstrate that IKKa/B enzymatic activity is constitutively elevated in T-cell lines expressing HTLV-1 Tax .
Kinase-deficient mutants of NIK , but not PAK1 , inhibit HTLV-1 Tax induction of The potential involvement of NIK in Tax induction of NF- « B was next evaluated .
As noted , NIK represents the next upstream component of the TNF-a and IL-1 signaling pathways ( Fig .
1 ) .
When introduced into 293 cells alone , NIK functioned as a potent activator of < B-lucif-erase activity ( Fig .
5A ) as previously reported ( 35 ) .
Cotransfection of 293 cells with Tax and increasing amounts of the kinase-deficient NIK mutant ( KK429/430¥AA ) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of « B-luciferase reporter activity in these cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
In contrast , cotransfection of matching amounts of the wild-type NIK expression vector led to enhancement rather than inhibition of the Tax response .
Immunoblotting of the cell lysates verified the presence of comparable levels of Tax in the presence of the NIK KK429/430AA mutant ( Fig .
5B , inset ) .
The potential role of PAK1 in the Tax response was similarly evaluated .
PAK1 is activated by certain small GTPases of the Rho family ( Rac and CDC42 ) ( 67 ) .
PAK1 , like the small GTPases , activates JNK , suggesting that it may be a downstream effector of the Rho GTPases ( 27 ) .
However , the role of PAK1 in NF- « B activation is unknown .
Cotransfection of increasing amounts of a kinase-deficient mutant ( K299R ) of PAK1 had no effect on Tax induction of NF-kB ( Fig .
5D ) .
Blotting of the cellular lysates confirmed dose-related expression of PAK1 and comparable levels of Tax expression ( Fig .
5D , inset ) .

Functional effects of wild-type and kinase-deficient NIK on HTLV-1 Tax-induced NF- « B expression .
( A ) 293 cells were transfected with various amounts of wild-type Myc-NIK expression vector , 200 ng of « B-luciferase re-porter , and 20 ng of the 6RZ plasmid ; 18 to 24 h later , cell lysates were prepared and « B-luciferase activity was determined .
Results are presented as relative light units normalized to B-galactosidase activity .
Error bars depict standard deviations obtained for triplicate transfections .
( B ) 293 cells were transfected with 1 g of Tax expression vector , 200 ng of « B-TATA-luciferase , 20 ng of 6RZ , and 25 , 100 , or 400 ng of the kinase-deficient KK429/430AA mutant of Myc-NIK or wild-type Myc-NIK .
Results are presented relative to the response obtained with Tax alone as described in the legend to Fig .

The inset shows the level of Tax expression in each of the cultures determined by immunoblotting .
( C ) Functional effects of a kinase-deficient NIK mutant on Tax induction of NF- « B expression in Jurkat T cells .
Jurkat T cells were transfected as described in the legend to Fig .
3 with various amounts ( 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1 ag ) of the KK429/430AA mutant of Myc-NIK and 350 ng of Tax and 500 ng of the or HTLV-1 LTR luciferase reporter plasmid .
Results are expressed as a percentage of the response obtained in the presence of Tax alone .
( D ) The same experiment as described for panel B was performed except that 293 cells were transfected with the K299R kinase-deficient mutant of Myc-PAK1 .
Levels of Tax and Myc-PAK1 K299R expressed in these cultures are shown in the inset .
( E ) The same experiment as described for panel C was performed except that Jurkat T cells were transfected with the kinase-deficient mutant Myc-PAK1 K299R .
5162 GELEZIUNAS ET AL .
The effects of the kinase-deficient NIK and PAK1 mutants on Tax induced NF- « B expression were also assessed in Jurkat T cells .
The NIK KK429/430AA mutant produced dose-dependent inhibition of Tax-induced « B-luciferase activity but had essentially no effect on Tax induction of HTLV-1 LTR luciferase activity , which occurs independently of NF-kB ( Fig .
5C ) .
As observed in 293 cells , the kinase-deficient PAK1 K299R mutant did not inhibit « B-luciferase activity induced by Tax , nor did it alter the Tax induction of the HTLV-1 LTR ( Fig .
5E ) .
' % he lack of effect of the kinase-deficient PAK1 mutant further supports a specific effect for the kinase-deficient NIK mutant .
Together , these findings raise the possibility that Tax action proceeds through the activation of NIK enzymatic activity .
However , the observed inhibitory effects of the NIK KK429/430AA mutant observed in both 293 and Jurkat T cells could also result from its binding to and inactivation of IKKs , making these latter kinases unresponsive to Tax .
These two possibilities could be distinguished by assessing the effects of Tax on NIK enzymatic activity .
However , our studies indicate that ectopically expressed NIK is constitutively active and not induced further by TNF- « , TRAF2 , or Tax ( data not shown ) .
Resolution of this issue thus awaits the development of an im-munoprecipitating anti-NIK antibody that will allow assessment of endogenous NIK activity in the presence and absence of Tax .
Dominant negative mutants of TRAF2 and TRAF6 fail to inhibit HTLV-1 Tax induction of NF- « B .
TRAF2 interacts with TRADD and activates NF- « kB presumably through its interaction with NIK ( 35 , 52 ) .
An amino-terminal deletion mutant of TRAF2 [ TRAF2 ( 87-501 ) ] , lacking its RING finger domain , functions as a dominant negative inhibitor in the TNF- « /TNFR1 signaling pathway , blocking both NF-kB and JNK activation ( 22 , 34 , 59 ) .
When cotransfected with Tax , the dominant negative TRAF2 mutant did not alter Tax activation of NF- « B ( Fig .
6B ) .
However , in agreement with prior studies ( 22 ) , this same mutant significantly inhibited the TNF- « -in-duced NF- « B response ( Fig .
6A ) .
This result suggests that Tax enters the TNF-a signaling pathway downstream of TRAF2 or perhaps through a different TRAF .
In this regard , TRAF6 is recruited to IL-1R1 by the MyD88 adaptor and a serine/thre-onine kinase termed IRAK ( 8 , 45 , 71 ) .
To rule out that Tax activates NF-kB via TRAF6 , the amino-terminal deletion mutant TRAF6 ( 289-522 ) was cotransfected with Tax .
While the TRAF6 dominant negative mutant effectively blocked IL-1 signaling ( Fig .
6C ) ( 8 ) , no significant inhibitory effects were obtained for Tax induction of NF- « B ( Fig .
6D ) .
These results indicate that Tax induction of NF-kB involves neither TRAF2 nor TRAF6 and suggest that Tax enters this proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway downstream of the site of action of these TRAFs .
HTLV-1 Tax is a weak inducer of JNK1 enzymatic activity in 293 cells .
MEKK1 represents another kinase of the MAP3K level that acts immediately downstream of TRAF2 ( 34 , 59 ) .
MEKK1 acting through the stimulation of MKK4 is a critical signaling intermediate for TNF- « activation of JNK , which in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun ( 41 , 75 ) .
MEKK1 has also been reported to activate NF-kB when ectopically expressed , but its role in the NF- « B arm of the TNF-a signaling pathway ( Fig .
1 ) is controversial ( 20 , 32 , 34 , 59 ) .
Having established that Tax enters the TNF- « /TNFR1 pathway downstream of TRAF2 and perhaps at the level of NIK , we next explored whether the MEKK1-MKK4-JNK axis ( Fig .
1 ) was activated by Tax .
For these studies , we examined whether HTLV-1 Tax activated JNK1 enzymatic activity .
293 cells were transfected with both « B-luciferase and FLAG-JNK .

Effects of dominant negative mutants of TRAF2 and TRAF6 on Tax induction of « B-luciferase activity .
( A ) 293 cells were transfected with 200 ng of « B-TATA-luciferase , 20 ng of 6RZ , and 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1 ug of a dominant negative FLAG-TRAF2 ( 87-501 ) mutant .
Approximately 24 h after transfection , the cells were stimulated with TNF- « ( 10 ng/m ! )
for 6 h. ( B ) 293 cells were transfected with 1 pg of the Tax expression vector , 200 ng of xB-TATA-luciferase , 20 ng of 6RZ , and 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1 mg of FLAG-TRAF2 ( 87-501 ) .
Luciferase activity was determined approximately 30 h later and normalized to B-galactosidase activity .
( C ) HeLa cells were transfected with 200 ng of xB-TATA-luciferase , 20 ng of 6RZ , and 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1 ug of a dominant negative Myc-TRAF6 ( 289-522 ) mutant .
At approximately 24 h posttransfection , the cells were stimulated with IL-1B ( 10 ng/ ml ) for 6 h. ( D ) HeLa cells were transfected with 1 g of Tax expression vector , 200 ng of « B-TATA-luciferase , 20 ng of 6RZ , and 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1 ug of Myc-TRAF6G ( 289-522 ) .
Luciferase activity was determined at approximately 30 h posttransfection .
The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant at 4 pg by supplementation with pCMV4 .
Luciferase activity was normalized to B-galactosidase activity , and the values represent the means ( + standard deviations ) of three independent transfections .
The values were first expressed as fold induction relative to cells transfected with reporters only .
Final values were expressed as percentages of the TNF- « , IL-1 , or Tax response .
transfection of an N-terminally truncated MEKK1 mutant ( 30 ) which is constitutively active led to substantial activation of JNK1 as assessed by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun ( 1-79 ) substrate in vitro ( Fig .
7A ) .
At the highest dose of MEKK1 expression vector ( 2 ug ) , NF-xB was also activated ( Fig .
7B ) .
Cotransfection of Myc-TRAF2 or treatment of cells with TNF-a for 30 min also led to enhanced JNK1 activity ( Fig .
7A ) .
Myc-TRAF2 expression as well as treatment of cells with TNF-a for 6 h also led to NF-KB activation ( Fig .
7B ) .
In contrast , cotransfection of Tax caused only a modest induction of JNK1 activation compared to the other agonists despite causing substantial NF-kB activation in these same transfected cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
This finding is consistent with a previous report demonstrating a similar modest induction of JNKI1 enzymatic activity by Tax in other cell types ( 23 ) .
These results suggest that in contrast to its ability to activate NF-kB , Tax does not significantly activate the MEKK1-MKK4-JNK1 pathway .

Finally , 293 cells transfected with reporters only were treated for 30 min and 6 h with 100 ng of TNF-a per ml .
Cell lysates were prepared to determine luciferase activity and B-galactosidase activity and were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody .
Anti-FLAG M2 immunoprecipitates from each transfection were subjected to in vitro kinase assays in the presence of GST-c-Jun ( 1-79 ) as an exogenous substrate .
In vitro kinase reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose .
Membranes were subsequently probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody to establish levels of immunoprecipitated FLAG-JNK1 .

The data are presented as relative luciferase activity based on arbitrary light units .
DISCUSSION To identify the molecular mechanism ( s ) underlying HTLV-1 Tax induction of NF-kB , we have explored the potential involvement of several components of the TNF- « and IL-1 signaling pathways .
These studies have revealed that kinase-deficient forms of IKKa , IKKB , and NIK , but not PAK1 , effectively inhibit Tax induction of NF-kB in both human 293 and Jurkat T cells .
Further , these investigations have demonstrated that wild-type Tax enhances both IKKa and IKKB enzymatic activities .
In contrast , the M22 Tax mutant , which manifests a specific defect in NF- « B activation , does not significantly stimulate these kinases .
Additionally , we have found that the endogenous IKKa and IKKB enzymes present in HTLV-1-infected and Tax-expressing T-cell lines are quite ac-tive .
Further , we have detected Tax activation of endogenous IKKa/B in Jurkat T cells stably expressing Tax compared with matched Jurkat anti-Tax controls .
These results thus significantly extend our prior study in which we demonstrated the involvement of pp90'* in phorbol ester- but not Tax-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa ( 14 ) .
These findings indicate that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein activates only a subset of the cellular kinases capable of phosphorylating IxBa .
The ability of Tax to activate the IKKs appears to be quite specific since a parallel pathway which is initiated by TRAF and involves MEKK1-MKK4 activation of JNK1 does not appear to be significantly induced by Tax .
Thus , although MEKK1 has been proposed as an inducer of NF- « B , it seems unlikely that Tax activation of NF- « B proceeds through MEKK1 .
For this to occur , Tax would have to activate MEKK1 in a manner not leading to standard JNKI activation .
Tax INDUCTION OF NF- « B INVOLVES IKKe AND IKKB - 5163 The ability of a kinase-deficient form of NIK to block Tax induction of NF- « B raised the distinct possibility that Tax action involved this component of the TNF-a and IL-1 signaling cascade .
However , the high constitutive activity of this enzyme obtained following its ectopic expression coupled with a lack of response of the kinase to TNF- « , TRAF2 , or Tax precluded firm assignment of this enzyme to the intracellular pathway utilized by Tax .
The involvement of NIK in this reaction could be evaluated if an active inducible form of endogenous NIK could be immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Tax .
Un-fortunately , reagents to perform such an experiment are not available at the present time .
In addition , we can not completely exclude the involvement of yet another MAP3K in the Tax response whose activity is inhibited by expression of kinase-deficient NIK .
However , it is interesting that both Tax and NIK possess similar properties with regard to activation of IKKs and JNK .
Specifically , Tax ( Fig .
4 ) , like NIK ( 51 , 72 ) , activates both IKKs , while neither of these proteins significantly activates JNK1 ( 23 , 59 , 73 ) ( Fig .
7 ) .
While Tax utilizes the IKKa , IKKB , and perhaps NIK components of the TNF-a and IL-1 signaling pathways , more proximal components of these pathways , specifically TRAF2 and TRAF6 , do not appear to be involved in Tax induction of NF-xB .
This conclusion is based on the fact that dominant negative mutants of TRAF2 and TRAF6 , which effectively block TNF-a and IL-1 signaling , respectively , fail to inhibit Tax induction of NF-kB .
These findings further suggest that Tax does not activate NF-kB via the induced transcription and autocrine action of TNF-a or IL-1 .
However , our results do not formally exclude the possibility that Tax activates the expression of another cytokine that is secreted and binds to a receptor that functions independently of TRAF2 and TRAF6 , leading to the stimulation of NIK and IKKs .
It remains unknown whether Tax subverts the TNF- @ /IL-1 signaling pathway by directly interacting with and activating NIK and/or IKKa or IKKS or by indirectly altering the expression levels of various components of this pathway .
However , enhanced levels of IKKs in HTLV-1 Tax-expressing cell lines is unlikely to be the cause of increased NF-KB activity since the levels of endogenous IKKs were comparable to levels in cells that did not express Tax ( Fig .
4C and D ) .
A prior report indicating that Tax induces nuclear NF- « B expression in the absence of de novo protein synthesis further argues against an indirect effect involving new gene transcription ( 33 ) .
Although Tax has been reported to be principally a nuclear protein , it is also present in the cytoplasm ( 4 , 26 , 43 ) .
Indeed , Tax avidly binds to the p100 product of the NF- « xB2 gene , an exclusively cytoplasmic member of the IxB family of proteins ( 4 , 26 , 31 , 44 ) .
This interaction may thus ensure a cytoplasmic pool of Tax to mediate subsequent activation of IKKa , IKKB , and perhaps NIK .
If Tax does in fact act in a direct manner at the level of NIK , our findings raise the intriguing possibility that Tax functions as a TRAF-like molecule .
The TRAFs may act by producing oligomerization of the downstream kinase , leading to altered enzymatic activity .
In this regard , the M22 mutant of Tax , which fails to activate IKKa and IKKB catalytic activities , also fails to dimerize ( 65 ) .
Alternatively , Tax may function through an as yet unidentified TRAF to promote aggregation of NIK .
Indeed , biological precedence exists for such a mechanism .
Specifically , the cytoplasmic domain of the transforming LMP1 protein encoded by Epstein-Barr virus has been shown to associate with TRAFs and to induce NF-kB ( 42 ) .
It has been suggested that LMP1 causes aggregation of TRAFs and may mimic the effects of TNF binding to its trimeric receptor ( 42 ) .
It is also possible that Tax induces nuclear NF- « B expression 5164 GELEZIUNAS ET AL .
by altering the levels of endogenous NIK .
In this regard , NIK expression levels have been shown to correlate with NF-kB activation ( 35 ) ( Fig .
SA ) .
Finally , it is possible that Tax induces the expression of an unknown activator of the NIK or IKK enzymes or perhaps down-regulates the expression or activity of an inhibitor of these kinases such as protein phosphatase 2A ( 10 ) .
Future studies will help delineate which of these mechanisms of action is utilized by Tax .
In terms of the biology of HTLV-1 infection , Tax induction of NF- « B in virally infected T cells may play a central role in cellular transformation leading to the ATL .
One possible role for Tax-induced NF- « B expression would be to inhibit apoptosis in infected T cells .
In this regard , it has recently been shown that expression is induced by transforming Ras mutants and that NF-kB production inhibits a p53-independent pathway of apoptosis in these cells ( 38 ) .
In conclusion , our studies reveal how HTLV-1 Tax subverts specific plasma membrane-distal components of the physiological proinflammatory signaling pathway leading to the pathologically sustained induction of NF-kB .
These findings thus provide new insights into the molecular basis of Tax action , emphasizing its ability to directly or indirectly alter the activity of cytoplasmic kinases pivotally involved in signal-coupled degradation of IxB .
Should the abnormal expression of NF- « B play a central role in -associated leukemogenesis , the development of inhibitors of NIK or IKKa and IKKB might serve not only as anti-inflammatory agents but also as novel chemotherapeutics potentially active against HTLV-1-induced ATL .
