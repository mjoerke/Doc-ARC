Activation-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation of the Human Jas Promoter Requires NF- « B p50-p65 Recruitment HENRY CHAN , DAVID P. BARTOS , anp LAURIE B. OWEN-SCHAUB* Department of Immunology , The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , Texas 77030 Received 19 June 1998/Returned for modification 14 August 1998/Accepted 10 December 1998 Fas ( CD95 ) and Fas ligand ( CD95L ) are an interacting receptor-ligand pair required for immune homeosta-sis .
Lymphocyte activation results in the upregulation of Fas expression and the acquisition of sensitivity to FasL-mediated apoptosis .
Although Fas upregulation is central to the preservation of immunologic tolerance , little is known about the molecular machinery underlying this process .
To investigate the events involved in activation-induced Fas upregulation , we have examined mRNA accumulation , fas promoter activity , and protein expression in the Jurkat T-cell line treated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin ( P/D ) , pharmacological mimics of T-cell receptor activation .
Although resting Jurkat cells express Fas , Fas mRNA was induced approximately 10-fold in 2 h upon P/I stimulation .
Using sequential deletion mutants of the human fas promoter in transient transfection assays , we identified a 47-bp sequence ( positions -306 to -260 relative to the ATG ) required for activation-driven fas upregulation .
Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a previously unrecognized composite binding site for both the Spl and NF-KB transcription factors at positions -295 to -286 .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and supershift analyses of this region documented constitutive binding of Spl in unactivated nuclear extracts and inducible binding of p50-p65 NF-KB heterodimers after P/I activation .
Spl and NF-B transcription factor binding was shown to be mutually exclusive by EMSA displacement studies with purified recombinant Spl and recombinant p50 .
The functional contribution of the « B-Spl composite site in P/I-inducible fas promoter activation was verified by using B-Sp1 concatamers ( -295 to -286 ) in a thymidine kinase promoter-driven reporter construct and native promoter constructs in Jurkat cells overexpressing Site-directed mutagenesis of the critical guanine nucleotides in the xB-Sp1 element documented the essential role of this site in activation-dependent fas promoter induction .
Lymphocyte activation results in the transcription of a number of gene products that mobilize and maintain a functional immune response .
Such gene products regulate cellular differ-entiation , effector function , and clonal expansion of the responding lymphocyte population .
One such gene product is Fas ( CD95 ) , a cell surface protein known to induce apoptosis in activated lymphocytes upon binding to its cognate ligand ( FasL ) .
The essential roles of Fas and FasL in the maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance underscore their prominence as homeostatic regulators of the immune system ( reviewed in reference 41 ) .
Within the T-cell compartment , Fas is expressed on immature thymocytes , but does not appear to be involved in thymic deletion ( 13 , 17 ) .
Fas expression on resting peripheral blood lymphocytes is low to absent ( 26 , 37 , 41 , 44 ) .
Primary T-cell activation results in upregulation of fas mRNA and protein followed by the gradual acquisition of sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis ( 37 , 44 ) .
Although the regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis is complex , involving assembly of the intracellular proteins necessary to initiate the apoptotic cascade ( 7 , 40 ) and an absence or low abundance of inhibitory proteins , such as FAP-1 ( 53 ) , FLIP ( 22 ) , bel-2 , and bel-x , , ( 6 , 23 , 25 ) , Fas receptor cross-linking is fundamentally required ( 24 ) .
Fas expression is maintained on activated lymphocytes for several weeks ( 44 ) , and upon secondary exposure to anti-gen , FasL is upregulated ( 1 , 14 , 26 ) .
Autocrine or paracrine interactions of Fas and FasL result in the apoptotic elimination of responding CD4* lymphocytes , a process termed `` activa- * Corresponding author .

2098 tion-induced cell death '' ( AICD ) ( 1 , 14 , 26 ) .
AICD can also be induced in CD4 * T-cell lines by T-cell receptor ( TCR ) engagement or pharmacological mimics of TCR signaling , such as anti-CD3 antibodies or phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) plus ionomycin ( P/I ) , respectively .
In direct contrast , activated CD8 * T cells do not appear to undergo apoptosis as a result of Fas ligation , but rather are stimulated to undergo clonal expansion by reverse signaling through FasL ( 59 ) .
Thus , while Fas appears to be equivalently upregulated in both CD4 * and CD8* T cells upon activation ( 37 ) , the signals transduced by both Fas and FasL have dissimilar biological effects on the two lymphocyte subsets .
The transcriptional machinery controlling Fas expression is largely unknown .
Genomic organization studies showed that human fas is a single-copy gene containing nine exons and eight introns , spanning approximately 25 kb ( 5 ) .
Sequences proximal to the Fas translational start site have a relatively high GC content ( 61 % ) between -590 and -1 , a number of CpG dinucleotides ( 28 CpGs between -590 and -1 ) , and an absence of conventional TATA and CAAT boxes ( 5 ) .
These are properties characteristic of a class of polymerase II-dependent promoters that include housekeeping genes ( reviewed in reference 3 ) and other members of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -nerve growth factor receptor superfamily ( 28 , 51 , 52 , 54 ) .
Although Fas is constitutively expressed on a variety of nonhematopoietic cells and hematopoietic cell lines ( 33 , 43 ) , multiple reports have documented Fas inducibility in response to such stimuli as UV irradiation , viral infection , wild-type p53 , hypoxia , and chemotherapeutic agents ( 2 , 34 , 39 , 45 , 47 , 61 ) .
To date , however , the molecular events regulating constitutive and inducible fas expression have not been elucidated .
In the present study , we have investigated the transcriptional Vor .
19 , 1999 machinery required for activation-dependent induction of Fas expression in the CD4 * Jurkat T-cell line .
Although constitutively expressed on Jurkat cells , Fas can be markedly upregulated by P/I activation .
Using deletion constructs of the fas promoter in luciferase reporter assays , we demonstrate the presence of a previously unrecognized , activation-responsive 47-bp sequence containing a composite binding site for both Sp1 and NF-xB transcription factors .
Characterization of this noncanonical site ( located at positions -295 to -286 ) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and supershift analyses revealed that Sp1 was constitutively bound to this site in untreated Jurkat cells , while p50-p65 NF- « B heterodimers were bound after P/I activation .
Site-directed mutagenesis of the critical guanine nucleotides in the < B-Sp1 site , as well as inhibition of IxB degradation or NF-kB translocation , inhibited inducible Fas transcription .
Taken together , our results indicate a critical requirement for NF- « B translocation to the site at positions -295 to -286 in activation-driven fas promoter induction .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and cellular activation .
The T-lymphoma cell line Jurkat-E6 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , Md . )
and cultured in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 with 10 % fetal bovine serum [ FBS ] and 2 mM r-glutamine ) at 0.4 X 10° to 0.7 X 10° cells/ml .
For activation studies , Jurkat cells were removed from culture and washed once with RPMI 1640 , plated in 10 ml of complete medium , and rested overnight .
The following day , cells were activated with PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )
and ionomycin ( 3 pg/ml ) for the times indicated ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo . ) .
Flow cytometric analysis .
Indirect antibody staining and flow cytometric analyses were carried out as described previously ( 43 ) .
Briefly , 10° cells in 100 pl of Dulbecco 's phosphate-buffered saline ( D-PBS ) containing 2 % FBS and 0.1 % sodium azide ( fluorescence-activated cell sorter [ FACS ] buffer ) were incubated with either 150 ng of UB2 ( Kaimaya Biomedical Co. , Tukwila , Wash. ) or isotype-matched , control mouse anti-human immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) antibodies ( Sig-ma ) at 4°C for 30 min .
Samples were washed twice in FACS buifer , and phyco-erythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were added in 100 pl of FACS buffer for 30 min at 4°C .
Samples were washed twice with FACS buffer , fixed overnight in PBS containing 1 % paraformaldehyde , and analyzed with a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson and Co. , Mountain View , Calif. ) .
Ten thousand cells were analyzed for each sample , with the gate set to exclude dead cells and debris .
RNA isolation and RPAs .
At the indicated time points , P/I-treated Jurkat cells were pelleted and washed once in D-PBS .
Control Jurkat cells were similarly cultured but were not treated with P/I .
Total RNA from 10 '' cells per sample was extracted with the RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , Calif. ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and RNase protection assays ( RPA ) were performed with the HybSpeed RPA kit ( Ambion , Austin , Tex . ) .
Samples ( 25 pg of total RNA ) were hybridized to a riboprobe spanning Fas exons 3 to 6 ( cDNA sequence 510 to 750 ) and a control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) riboprobe .
Following RNAse digestion , protected products were boiled , separated by electrophoresis on a 5 % urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) gel , and analyzed by autoradiography .
Scanning densitometry ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) was used to quantitate the fas and GAPDH band intensities of cach sample .
Relative fold induction was calculated by dividing each normalized f2s/GAPDH ratio against the zero time point .
Generation of fas promoter constructs and site-directed mutagenesis .
A human placental genomic phage library ( Clonetech , Palo Alto , Calif. ) was screened with a PCR-generated , [ a-* '' P ] dCTP-labeled Fas cDNA probe containing 5 ' untranslated exon 1 and 2 sequences : forward , 5 ' GGACCCGCTCAGTACGG AGTT ; reverse , 5° TTCACCTGGAGGACAGGGCTTATG ( Life Technolo-gies , Grand Island , N.Y. ) .
Plaque hybridizations were carried out as previously described ( 52 ) , and filters were washed sequentially in 6 % SSC ( 0.9 M NaCl , 0.09 M sodium citrate ) -0.1 % sodium dodecy ] sulfate ( SDS ) at 42°C for 20 min , 2 % SSC-0.1 % SDS at 60°C for 20 min , and 1 % SSC-0.1 % SDS for 20 min before autoradiography .
Approximately 1.35 x 10° plaques were screened , followed by sequential hybridizations of the positive clones .
Subsequent subcloning of SacI or HindIII inserts into pGEMI1Zf ( + ) ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) identified a 2.16-kb HindIII fragment containing 1.74 kb proximal to the Fas translational start site ( FasH3 ) .
Sanger dideoxy sequencing ( U.S. Biochemical Corp. , Cleve-land , Ohio ) confirmed that FasH3 contained 5 ' flanking sequences identical to those previously reported for human fas ( 5 ) .
Reporter constructs were generated with the 2.16-kb FasH3 fragment and primers corresponding to sequences -1739 to -1717 ( 5 ' AATAATCACTCAT CTCACTGGGC ) and -43 to -19 ( 5° CGAAGTGAAAGAGCITTCCCCAAC TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF THE HUMAN frs PROMOTER - 2099 TC ) by PCR to generate a 1.72-kb product .
This PCR product was then subcloned into the peR2 expression vector ( Invitrogen , San Diego , Calif. ) and digested with EcoRI , and the insert was shuttled into pGEM7+ ( Promega ) ( pFPR7+ ) .
A partial Xhol digest and complete HindIII digest of pFPR7+ were made to insert the 1.7-kb fragment into the pGL2Basic luciferase reporter construct ( Promega ) in either orientation .
The final constructs , FPR1-Luc ( + ) and FPR1-Luc ( - ) , spanning the region ( 1739 to -19 ) upstream of the fas ATG were sequenced to verify orientation and identity .
The thymidine kinase promoter reporter construct tk-Luc was generated by subcloning the Bg/II-HindIII fragment of the thymidine kinase promoter from pRL-tk ( Promega ) into pGEM-11 , followed by insertion of the Secl-Hind [ II fragment into pGL2B .
The A5/A6-tk-Luc reporter was constructed by subcloning the Secl fragment from FPR-Luc ( + ) into tk-Luc , digesting it with Xhol-Psfl , treating it with a Klenow fragment to fill recessed ends , and performing blunt end ligation .
Deletion constructs were generated as follows .
A5-Lue ( -460 to -19 ) is the product of a religated XhoI digest of FPR-Luc { + ) ; A6-Lue ( -236 to -19 ) is the product of a religated complete SacI digest of FPR-Luc ( + ) .
Constructs within the A5-Luc region were generated by PCR with the following oligonucleotides , digested with KpnI ( underlined ) -HindIlI ( double underlined ) , and subcloned directly into pGL2B : A5.4+ ( 5 ) GGGTACC-*°GCCACTGCAGGAACGCCC CGGGACAG ) ; A5.5+ ( 5'GGGTACC TACC ) ; A5.7+ *°TCCCCAACCCGGGCGTTCCCCAGCG ) ; A5.8+ _ ( 5GGGTACC `` ° GACCACCGGGGCTTTTCGTGAGCTCGTCT ) ; FasRIH- - CGAAGTGAAAGAGCTTCCCCAAC ) .
The mutagenized reporter constructs AS5M5.7-Luc and A5M5.8-Luc were generated by PCR with the appropriate primers ( A5.7M , 5°CTCCCCAACCCittCG TTCCCCAGCG [ forward ] and 5°CCTCGCTGGGGAACGaaaGGGTTGG [ re-verse } ; A5.8M , 5°CCGecyCTTITTCGTGAGCTCGTCT [ forward ] and 5'AGAC GAGCTCACGAAAAGrggCGG [ reverse ] ; mutated nucleotides are in lower-case ) by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing with vector and internal primers .
Luciferase reporters containing « B-Sp1 concatemers were constructed with oligonucleotides having two copies of the element at position -295 to position -286 .
These oligonucleotides were synthesized with either KpnI ( underlined ) or Sacl ( double underlined ) 3 ' overhangs ( forward , 5°CGGGCGTTCCCAAAAAG GGCGTTCCCGAGCT and reverse , 5CGGGAACGCCCITTITTTGGGAACG CCCGGTAC ; forward , 5'CGGGCGTTCCCAAAAAGGGCGTTCCCGGTAC and reverse , 5°CGGGAACGCCCTITTITTGGGAACGCCCGAGCT } .
The corresponding 5° KpnI-3 ' Sacl or 5 '' Secl-3 ' KpnI oligonucleotides were annealed ( 10 min at 85°C and then cooled to room temperature ) , and timed ligations were prepared with T4 ligase with various ratios of the double-stranded primers .
Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were heated to 75°C for 10 min to inactivate the ligase before subcloning into the KpnI-Sacl-digested tk-Luc vector ( see above ) .
Various clones were screened by sequence analysis to determine the number of B-Sp1 elements present .
The resultant constructs containing two , four , and six copies of the kB-Sp1 site were used for transient transfection and reporter assays .
Transient transfections and reporter assays .
A DEAE-dextran-chloroquine mixture was used for transient transfection of Jurkat cells .
Briefly , 5 X 10° to 7.5 X 10° exponentially growing cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of transfection solution ( RPMI plus 250 pg of DEAE-dextran per ml , 0.1 M Tris [ pH 7.2 ] , and 0.1 mM chloroquine ) together with 10 pg of reporter construct and 10 ng of the pRL-tk Renilla normalizing luciferase vector ( Promega ) .
The cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C , washed , and plated in 10 ml of complete media .
After a 20-h recovery , transfected cells were activated with P/I for 8 h. Cell extracts and luciferase reagents were prepared with the Promega Dual-Lucif-erase Reporter Assay System .
Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were monitored with a luminometer ( Turner Industries , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
Normalized reporter activity is expressed as the firefly luciferase value divided by the Renilla luciferase value .
Relative fold induction is calculated as the normalized reporter activity of the test sample divided by either the untreated FPR-Luc or A5-Luc reporter construct , as indicated below .
The Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven IxBa construct ( RSV-IxBa ) and vector control were obtained from Tse-Wa Tan ( Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Tex . ) .
Nuclear extract preparation , EMSAs , supershift analyses , and displacement studies .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified method of Dignam et al .
( 15 ) .
In brief , 7.5 X 10° Jurkat cells were washed in PBS and pelleted before resuspension in 200 l of cold buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] ) and incubated for 20 min on ice prior to the addition of 200 ul of cold buffer B ( buffer A with 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 ) .
Cells were gently pipetted and returned on ice for another 20 min .
Nuclei were pelleted ( 5,000 x g , 2 min ) , washed in buffer A , and pelleted again , and nuclear proteins were extracted in 25 ul of buffer D ( 400 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol 1 mM PMSF ) .
The tubes were iced for at least 30 min , followed by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min .
The supernatant was recov-ered , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at -80°C prior to use .
Probes used for EMSAs were radiolabeled by [ y-P ] ATP end labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase .
Briefly , 30 pg of the A5-Luc plasmid was digested with Xhol , dephosphorylated with calf intestine phosphatase , and both enzymes were inactivated at 85°C for 10 min .
An aliquot of the digest ( 7.5 mg ) was end labeled 2100 CHAN ET AL .
with [ y- > °P ] ATP for 60 min before the kinase was inactivated at 75°C for 10 min .
The end-labeled plasmid was then digested overnight with Seel , and the released probe A ( -460 to -236 ) was gel purified as described previously ( 11 ) .
The oligonucleotide probe B ( -306 to -278 ; 5'~**°CTCCCCAACCCGGGCGTTC CCCAGCGAGG ) or its mutated counterpart was annealed to the corresponding complementary sequence before 1 pmol was end labeled with [ y-*°P ] ATP for 30 min .
The labeled probe was purified from unincorporated nucleotides by using a Chroma Spin 10 column ( Clonetech ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
The specific activities of all `` P-labeled oligoprobes were routinely 5 X 10° to 6 x 10° cpm per pmol .
Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , Calif. ) .
For EMSAs , 6 pg of nuclear extract was incubated in a total volume of 19 pl of binding buffer [ 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.9 ) , 0.5 mM EDTA , 1 mg of poly ( dI-dC ) , and 5 % glycerol ] for 15 min at room temperature before 50,000 cpm of the indicated y-* '' P-end-labeled probe was added for another 15 min .
For competition assays , excess unlabeled oligonucleotides were preincubated for 15 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe ( 50,000 cpm ) .
For antibody-mediated supershift assays , extracts were preincubated with 1 pl of either anti-p50 , -p65 , -c-Rel ( Oncogene Research , Cam-bridge , Mass . )
-relB , -p52 , or -Sp1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) antibodies at 4°C for 45 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe .
The reactions were loaded on a 4.5 % polyacrylamide nondenaturing PAGE gel in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA electrophoresed for 2.5 h at 100 V before drying and exposed to autoradiographic film .
For displacement studies , 4 footprinting units ( fpu ) of Sp1 ( ~30 ng ; Promega ) was preincubated in a total volume of 19 pl of binding buffer for 5 min prior to addition of 12,500 cpm of labeled probe B .
After 15 min at room temperature , increasing amounts of recombinant p50 NF- « B ( Promega ) subunits were added for an additional 15 min before the mixture was loaded on a 4.5 % polyacrylamide PAGE gel as described above .
RESULTS Expression of Fas mRNA and protein is upregulated in Jurkat cells by pharmacological agents that mimic T-cell activation .
While resting T cells express low to undetectable levels of the Fas protein ( 26 , 37 , 41 , 44 ) , it is rapidly upregulated upon exposure to specific antigens , mitogens , cytokines , TCR antibodies , and various pharmacological agents such as P/I ( 6 , 37 , 44 ) .
The Jurkat T-cell line has an activated T-cell phenotype , in that it constitutively expresses cell surface Fas ( Fig .
1A ) .
Because we were interested in the transcriptional mechanisms controlling Fas expression , we asked whether Fas could be upregulated in Jurkat cells upon activation .
To this end , Jurkat cells were stimulated with P/I for various times , and mRNA and protein expression was determined with RPAs and FACS analyses , respectively .
As shown in Fig .
1A , Jurkat cells transiently upregulated surface Fas after P/I stimulation .
Increased Fas was detectable as early as 4 h poststimulation , reached maximal levels by 8 h , and declined to near-baseline levels by 24 h. A 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in both the percentage of cells expressing Fas as well as the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFT ) , representative of antigenic density on a per-cell basis , was observed .
Correspondingly , as shown in Fig .
1B , Fas mRNA levels were upregulated by 10-fold in Jurkat cells activated for 2 h ; mRNA levels declined subsequently over the time period examined ( 24 h ) .
These results demonstrate an immediate-early , activation-dependent upregulation of Fas in P/I-stimulated Jurkat cells , suggesting a likely transcriptional control .
A 220-bp region in the Fas promoter is required for activation-dependent upregulation .
To test the premise that activation-dependent Fas upregulation was modulated at the level of transcription , approximately 1.7 kb of the 5 ' region flanking the fas translational start site ( nucleotides -1739 to -19 ) were isolated from a human placental genomic library and subcloned into the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector in both orientations relative to the luciferase gene .
The basal activity of the FPR1-Luc ( + ) construct was first determined by transient transfections into various T- and B-cell lines , followed by extract preparations and luciferase activity measurements .
As shown in Fig .

The percentage of specific Fas staining and the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFT ) of Jurkat cells at each time point are shown to the right .

In B-cell lines , modest basal activity was observed only in Raji cells ( fivefold over empty vector alone ) , but not in Daudi or Ramos cells .
These results document that the 1.7-kb region upstream of the fas ATG contains a functional promoter operative in T-cell lines and certain B-cell lines .
To determine whether FPR1-Luc ( + ) was responsive to activation , transiently transfected Jurkat cells were treated with P/I as described in Materials and Methods , and the relative luciferase activities of untreated and P/I-stimulated cells were compared .
As shown in Fig .

-p Probe A : -460 / -236 compared to the basal activity of unstimulated Jurkat cells .
The fas promoter is orientation dependent , since FPR1-Luc ( - ) was inactive in both resting and stimulated cells .
To more precisely map the fas promoter region ( s ) responsive to P/I activation , two deletion constructs containing the sequences from -460 to -19 ( AS-Luc ) and -240 to -19 ( A6-Luc ) were prepared as described in Materials and Methods .
As shown in Fig .
2B , P/I inducibility of the fas promoter was maintained when the sequences between -1739 and -460 were deleted .
However , when sequences between -460 and -240 were deleted , P/I-induced upregulation was virtually absent .
As shown , FPR1-Luc ( + ) and A5S-Luc were upregulated 17- and 15-fold after P/I treatment , respectively , while the A6-Luc construct was upregulated by less than 4-fold .
Interestingly , no differences were noted in the activity of these constructs in unstimulated Jurkat cells , suggesting that the fas promoter sequences between -460 and -240 are critically important for activation-dependent , but not basal , transcription .
Sequence analysis within this region demonstrated the presence of consensus elements for several transcription factors , including AP-2 , GAS , NF-kB , and NF-AT .
To investigate whether the 220-bp region between -460 and -240 contained enhancer elements responsive to P/I activation , this region was subcloned proximal to a thymidine kinase promoter in a luciferase reporter construct ( AS/A6-tk-Luc ) , and transient transfection reporter assays were carried out .
As shown in Fig .
2B , the AS/A6-tk-Lue construct was highly inducible by P/I ( 12-fold relative to tk-Luc ) , at levels comparable to that of the native Fas promoter .
These results suggest that the fas promoter region between -460 and -240 contains enhancer element ( s ) necessary for activation responsiveness .

Basal and inducible fas promoter activity and in vitro EMSA analysis .
( A ) FPR1-Luc ( + ) containing the sequence from -1739 to -19 is active in T-cell lines and the B-lymphocyte line Raji , but inactive in Daudi or Ramos cells .
Cells were transfected with 10 ug of either the empty reporter ( pGL2B [ D ] ) or the fas promoter reporter vector ( FPR1-Luc [ MI ] ) ; 10 ng of pRL-tk vector was cotransfected for normalization .
Extracts were taken after 40 h , and luciferase activity was determined .
Relative fold activity was calculated as the normalized FPR1-Luc ( + ) activity divided by the normalized pGL2B value .
( B ) fas promoter sequences -460 to -240 are required for inducible fas reporter activity .
FPR1-Luc in both orientations ( forward and reverse ) , A5-Luc , A6-Luc , tk-Lue , and A5/A6-tk-Lue constructs were transiently transfected into Jurkat cells with pRL-tk for normalization , and the cells were then left untreated ( C ) or were activated with P/I ( I ) for 8 h before harvesting of the extracts for measurement of luciferase activity .
The values shown are averages of three independent experiments ( + standard deviation ) and are expressed as relative fold induction over normalized luciferase values from untreated Jurkat cells containing FPR1-Luc ( + ) .
For tk-Luc and A5/A6-tk-Luc , the relative fold induction was calculated separately as the normalized luciferase value divided by the untreated , normalized tk-Luc luciferase value .
( C ) Specific protein complexes bind the enhancer region between -460 and -236 .
*°P-labeled probe A ( 50,000 cpm ) was mixed with nuclear extracts from untreated or P/l-activated Jurkat cells ( left panel , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
Specific complexes ( C1 and C2 ) are indicated .
N.S. , nonspecific complexes .
Cold competition mixtures with a 25-fold excess of the indicated consensus elements ( right panel , lanes 4 to 7 ) were mixed with extracts from Jurkat cells activated with P/I for 1 h prior to addition of labeled probe A .
To analyze whether transcription factors may be involved in the activation-dependent upregulation of the fas promoter within this region , EMSA analyses were carried out .
Nuclear extracts , prepared from unactivated and P/I-stimulated Jurkat cells , were incubated with a °°P -labeled probe spanning the fas promoter region between -460 and -236 ( probe A ) .
A time course analysis revealed the presence of two complexes binding to this region .
An upper complex , designated C2 , was constitutively bound in unactivated Jurkat extracts throughout the course of activation ( Fig .
2C , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
A second lower complex , designated C1 , bound only upon P/I activation ( Fig .
2C , Lane 2 ) .
To determine the nature of the C1 and C2 com-plexes , cold-target competition was carried out with 25-fold excesses of the Sp1 , NF-kB , and AP-1 consensus elements .
As shown ( Fig .
2C , lane 5 ) , CZ binding was inhibited by Sp1-specific oligonucleotides , indicating the presence of an Sp1-like transcription factor at this site .
C1 binding was specifically competed by using « kB consensus oligonucleotides derived from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat ( HIV LTR ) ( Fig .
2C , lane 6 ) .
Other cold-target consensus elements tested , including AP-1 , AP-2 , NF-ATp , and GAS , were incapable of inhibiting either C1 or C2 binding ( Fig .

Localization of activation-dependent fas promoter activity .
( A ) The fas nucleotide sequence between -460 and -230 is shown with known consensus transcription factor elements indicated ( shaded areas ) .
The location and designation of the various deletion constructs are indicated by the solid arrow .
( B ) P/I inducibility of the fas promoter localizes between nucleotides -306 and -260 .
Jurkat cells transiently transfected with 10 g of the various deletion constructs and 10 ng of pRL-tk as the normalizing vector were left untreated ( 0 ) or activated with P/I ( @ I ) for 8 h before extracts were prepared for luciferase activity measurements .
The values shown are averages of three independent experiments + standard deviation and are expressed as the relative fold induction of the various deletion constructs over the untreated , normalized A5-Luc luciferase value .
bound constitutively , while NF- « B complex formation occurred only in response to stimulation .
Activation-dependent Fas promoter induction requires nucleotides -306 to -260 .
To analyze the region between -460 and -240 in further detail , sequential deletions of A5-Luc spanning 40- to 60-bp intervals were generated by PCR .
The precise sequences contained in the various constructs are shown in Fig .
3A .
Basal and inducible promoter activities in transiently transfected , unactivated , and P/I-stimulated Jurkat cells , respectively , are shown in Fig .
3B .
Deletion of nucleotides -460 to -306 and -259 to -240 had little effect on the activation-dependent induction of the fas promoter ( AS to A5.7 , A5.8 to A6 ) , ruling out the contribution of the consensus NF- « B sites located at -421 to -412 and -252 to -243 , the GAS element at -394 to -386 , and the NF-ATp-AP-2 site at positions -358 to -345 .
When nucleotides -306 to -260 ( A5.7 to A5.8 ) were deleted , however , inducible reporter activity was reduced to that observed with the A6 construct .
The sequences between -306 and -260 were devoid of any mapped transcription factor consensus sites , except for a kB-like motif present at positions -295 to -286 .
This motif con Mor .

tains the sequence GGGCGTTCCC and differs from the derived consensus kB p50-p65 heterodimer motif GGGRNNY YCC ( 20 , 30 , 48 ) at position 4 ( change of R to C ) .
Notably , however , the critical G , _ , nucleotides necessary for p50 binding are maintained .
Comparison of this motif to a consensus Sp1 site , KRGGCGKRRY ( 35 ) , also revealed homology at 8 of 10 residues , indicating a possible interaction with this transcription factor .
Taken together with results from our previous studies showing that complexes that could be competed with Sp1 and NF-kB oligonucleotides bound to the fas promoter region at -406 to -236 , it seemed likely that these transcription factors , acting alone or in combination , might be required for activation-dependent fas promoter induction .
Spl and NF- < B conjointly bind at the motif ( -295 to -286 ) during activation-driven fas promoter induction .
To further investigate the transcription factors involved in fas promoter upregulation in P/T-activated Jurkat cells , EMSA analyses of nuclear extracts were performed with a 29-bp probe spanning the noncanonical « B-Sp1-like motif ( -306 to -278 ; probe B ) .
In concert with our previous observations with probe A , spanning nucleotides -460 to -236 ( Fig .
2C ) , we observed constitutive binding of the CZ complex in both unactivated and P/I-stimulated extracts and inducible binding of the C1 complex upon activation ( Fig .
4A ) .
C1 was induced de novo within 15 min of P/I addition ( Fig .
4A , lane 2 ) and persisted for up to 2 h postactivation ( Fig .
4A , lane 5 ) .
The specificities of C1 and C2 binding to probe B were first demonstrated by cold-com-petition assays using excess unlabeled probe B ( Fig .
4A , lane 9 ) .
Jurkat extracts were coincubated with radiolabeled probe B and 25-fold excesses of either unlabeled AP-1- or NF-AT-specific oligonucleotides or a mutated probe B ( GGG to TTT [ see below ] ) .
Under these conditions , no displacement was observed in either C1 or C2 binding complexes ( Fig .
4A , lanes 7 , 8 , and 10 ) .
To investigate Sp1-NF- « B binding to probe B , Jurkat extracts were incubated with labeled probe B and increasing concentrations of unlabeled NF-kB consensus oligo-nucleotides .
With a 25-fold excess , NF-kB oligonucleotides effectively competed the inducible C1 complex , but not the C2 complex .
However , at 100-fold excess , both C2 and nonspecific binding were inhibited ( Fig .
4A , lanes 11 to 12 ) .
Increasing concentrations of Spl oligonucleotides , on the other hand , specifically competed the constitutive C2 complex , but not the inducible C1 binding ( Fig .
4A , lanes 13 and 14 ) .
We next addressed whether extracts from P/I-activated Jurkat cells bound to probe B could be supershifted by using antibodies against various NF- « kB-Rel family members , including p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , and RelB .
As shown in Fig .
4B , the inducible C1 complex was supershifted with antibodies against p50 , p65 , and to a lesser extent , c-Rel , indicating the presence of these heterodimers in the shifted complex ( Fig .
4B , lanes 2 to 4 ) .
No such shifted complexes were observed in extracts from unactivated Jurkat cells lacking the inducible C1 complex ( data not shown ) .
Antibodies against Sp1 , on the other hand , shifted the constitutive C2 complex in both activated ( Fig .
4B , lanes 7 and 8 ) and unactivated Jurkat extracts ( data not shown ) .
These results imply that Spl is bound to the kB-Sp1l site at -295 to -286 during normal basal transcription , whereas NF-kB p50-p65 heterodimers occupy the < B-Sp1 site during activation-driven fas promoter induction .
Mutually exclusive binding of Spl versus NF-KB at nucleotides -295 to -286 .
To assess whether binding of Spl and NF-kB to the -295 to -286 site in the fas promoter occurs concurrently or as a mutually exclusive event , EMSA analyses were performed with probe B with recombinant Sp1 and increasing amounts of recombinant p50 .
Consistent with our observations using extracts from unactivated Jurkat cells , a Vor .

In vitro analysis of a potential « B-Sp1 site at -295 to -286 .
( A ) Time course analysis of complex binding to probe B ( -306 to -278 ) .
Jurkat cells were activated with P/I for the indicated time , nuclear extracts were harvested , and EMSA analysis was performed with *°P-labeled probe B ( left panel , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF THE HUMAN f @ s PROMOTER - 2103 single complex is observed when probe B is mixed with Spl alone ( Fig .
4C , lane 2 ) .
As increasing amounts of recombinant p50 are added , however , the intensity of the Sp1 complex is decreased , with a concomitant increase in the lower p50 binding complex ( Fig .
4C , lanes 3 to 6 ) .
These results indicate that the fas promoter region at -295 to -286 contains a single < B-Sp1 binding motif to which either Spl or NF- « B is exclusively bound .
Upon cellular activation , constitutively bound Sp1 is likely displaced by NF-xB to drive fas promoter upregulation .
NF-B recruitment regulates activation-dependent Fas promoter induction .
Although the above in vitro analyses document that NF- « B heterodimers are rapidly recruited to the fas promoter region controlling activation-dependent induction , these studies do not address the functional consequences of the effects of NF-kB recruitment on fas promoter activity .
To investigate the role of NF- « B recruitment in activation-driven fas upregulation , the effects of various inhibitors of NF- « B function were examined .
Jurkat cells transiently transfected with the A5-Luc reporter were pretreated with two pharmacological inhibitors of NF- « B and then activated with P/I , and luciferase activity was determined .
As shown in Fig .
5A , cyclosporin A pretreatment of Jurkat cells completely prevented P/I-dependent upregulation of the fas promoter .
Because this calcineurin inhibitor can inhibit NF-AT translocation and disrupt Ca** signals leading to NF-kB induction ( 36 ) , the fungal metabolite gliotoxin , a specific inhibitor of IxB- « degradation and NF-kB translocation , was also used ( 46 ) .
Gliotoxin , but not the inactive gliotoxin derivative bis-dethio-bis ( methylthi0 ) gliotoxin , completely abolished P/I inducibility of the AS-Luc reporter , consistent with the notion that NF- « B recruitment was functionally required for activation-dependent fas promoter induction .
The critical requirement for NF- « B recruitment was additionally verified in Jurkat cells overexpressing wild-type IxB- « .
The overexpression of IxB- « , a natural inhibitor of NF-kB translocation , has been shown to effectively block « B-dependent transactivation ( 31 , 32 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5B , P/T-activated Jurkat cells transiently transfected with the AS-Lue reporter and RsV-IxB- « expression plasmid showed a dose-dependent decrease in fas promoter activity with increasing IxB-a « concentration .
Taken together , these results strongly support the premise that NF-kB translocation is essential for activation-dependent fas promoter induction .
The B-like motif at -295 to -286 controls activation-dependent fas promoter responses .
While previous experiments indicated that NF- « B translocation was essential for fas promoter induction , the functional significance of the kB element at positions -295 to -286 remained to be tested .

For NF- « B and Sp1 competition , a 25-fold excess ( lanes 11 and 13 ) and 100-fold excess ( lanes 12 and 14 ) of consensus oligonucleotides were added to equivalent amounts of P/I-activated nuclear extracts prior to addition of *°P-labeled probe B .

Inhibition of activation-dependent fas promoter upregulation .
( A ) Pharmacological inhibition of A5-Luc induction by P/I .
Jurkat cells transiently transfected with 10 pg of A5-Lue and 10 ng of pRL-tk were preincubated in the absence ( None ) or presence of cyclosporin A ( CsA [ 1 pg/ml ) ) , gliotoxin ( GT [ 1 pg/ml ] ) , or bis-dethio-bis ( methylthio ) gliotoxin ( DGT [ 3 pg/ml ] ) for 30 min prior to P/I stimulation for 8 h. Following incubation , cells were harvested for extract preparation , and luciferase activity was determined .
The values shown are representative of two independent experiments + standard deviation and are expressed as the relative fold induction over normalized untreated A5-Luc activity .
( B ) Dose-dependent inhibition of P/I-inducible A5-Luc reporter activity by I « Ba .
Increasing amounts of wild-type RsV-IxBa ( ID ) or vector control ( ® ) expression plasmid were cotransfected into Jurkat cells with 10 ug of A5-Lue and 10 ng of pRL-tk 40 h prior to P/I activation .
Cells were harvested for extract preparation after 8 h of P/I exposure , and luciferase activity was measured .
The values shown are averages from two independent experiments + standard deviation and are expressed as percent inhibition of P/I-induced , normalized A5-Luc reporter activity .
determine the specific contribution of this kB-Sp1l element , oligonucleotides were synthesized with the composite site altered ( as underlined ) ( GGGCGTTCCC to TTTCGTTCCC ) and with a mutagenized A5 fas reporter construct generated by PCR .
This construct was designated ASM5.7-Luc .
As a control , a second A5 reporter construct containing the xB site at -262 to -253 was also mutagenized ( ASMS5.8 ; GGGGCTTITTC to GCCYCTTTITC ) and used in reporter assays .
Jurkat cells transiently transfected with the wild-type AS-Lue construct , ASMS5.7-Luc , or the ASMS5.8-Luc control were activated with P/I , and reporter activity was measured .
Similar to previous experiments with the A5 deletion constructs ( Fig .
3B ) , both wild-type AS-Lue and ASM5.8-Luc showed an approximate 15-fold induction following activation ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , ASM5.7-Luc reporter activity increased only threefold after P/I treatment .
These results document the functional contribution of the kB-Spl site at positions -295 to -286 , but not the consensus NF-kB site at -262 to -243 , in activation-dependent fas promoter induction .
Interestingly , while ASM5.7-Lue induction was significantly suppressed compared to that of the wild-type A5-Luc construct ( 79.6 % + 10.61 % , respectively ) P/I inducibility was not entirely abolished .
Such findings suggest that an additional site or sites , perhaps in the region from -19 to -240 ( compare Fig .
3B to Fig .
6 ) , may be required for maximal fas promoter induction during T-cell activation .
To further verify the transcriptional contribution of the -295 to -286 kB-Sp1 composite site , concatemer constructs containing multiple copies of this element upstream of a thymidine kinase promoter-driven luciferase reporter were generated ( Fig .
2B ) .
Constructs containing none , two , four , or six copies of the xB-Sp1 element were transiently transfected into Jurkat cells , and the reporter activity was measured after P/I activation ( Fig .
6B ) .
As expected , the inducibility of the con-catemer-reporter constructs increased with the number of the < B-Sp1 elements multimerized , with six copies showing a > 35-fold specific induction over that of the thymidine kinase promoter alone .
As observed previously with the A5-Luc construct ( Fig .
5 ) , P/I inducibility of the xB-Sp1 concatemers was specifically eliminated by inhibitors of NF- « B translocation .
Fig ures 6B and C show the effects of gliotoxin and IxB- « overexpression on P/I inducibility of the < B-Spl-containing constructs .
Furthermore , in cells transfected with six copies of the element basal reporter activity was fourfold higher in unstimulated Jurkat cells than that of the tk-Luc reporter alone , suggesting a possible enhancement of constitutive fas promoter regulation by multiple Spl sites .
Taken together , these experiments confirm the functional significance of the xB-Sp1 site at -295 to -286 in the control of activation-driven fas promoter induction .
DISCUSSION In recent years , much attention has been focused on how the immune response is downregulated .
Because self-reactive T cells are ineffectively deleted by negative selection in the thy-mus , the preservation of immune homeostasis requires self-regulatory mechanisms for the maintenance of tolerance and the control of excessive T-cell proliferation to foreign antigens in the periphery .
Apoptosis is responsible for maintaining T-cell homeostasis by at least two mechanisms-AICD that occurs after TCR ligation by antigen and passive cell death that occurs in the absence of antigen or cytokine stimulation ( 1 , 14 , 26 , 63 ) .
The Fas-FasL-mediated pathway of apoptosis appears to be central in the regulation of peripheral tolerance , because mutations in either the receptor or the ligand can induce lymph-adenopathy and autoimmune disease in mice and humans caused by defects in AICD and peripheral T- and B-cell deletion ( 18 , 60 , 65 ) .
Fas is constitutively expressed on most cultured T cells , whereas freshly isolated , naive ( CD4SRO* ) peripheral blood T cells have little to no surface Fas .
Early after T-cell activation , Fas is rapidly upregulated , but these Fas-positive cells remain resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis ( 26 , 37 , 41 , 44 ) .
With the progression of an immune response , Fas-positive T cells acquire sensitivity to Fas-induced killing ( 37 , 44 ) .
Although Fas upregulation is known to be a prerequisite for the elicitation of Fas-FasL-mediated AICD ( 1 , 14 , 26 ) , the molecular mechanisms underlying this process have not been well investigated .

Using transient transfection reporter assays , we have localized a 47-bp sequence ( -306 to -260 ) upstream of the translational start site that confers P/I inducibility of the fas promoter ( Fig .

Within this region , a critical 10-bp enhancer ( -295 to -286 ) was shown to bind Sp1 during basal transcription expression and NF- « B p50-p65 heterodimers after P/I activation ( Fig .

The « B-Sp1 enhancer element is required for P/l-inducible A5-Luc reporter activity .
( A ) Nucleotide mutagenesis of A5-Luc at either the « B-Sp1 element ( GGG-CCC ; -295 to -293 [ ASMS5.7-Luc ] ) or the downstream NF- « B element ( GGG-CCY ; -252 to -249 [ A5M5.8-Luc ] ) was introduced by PCR .
Wild-type or mutagenized constructs were cotransfected into Jurkat cells with 10 ng of pRL-tk , and the cells were activated with P/I for 8 h prior to being harvested for extract preparation and luciferase activity measurements .
The values shown are averages of three independent experiments + standard deviations and are expressed as the relative fold increase over untreated , normalized A5-Lue luciferase activity .

Inhibition of NF- « B activity were analyzed by preincubation of transfected cells with either gliotoxin ( GT [ 1 pug/ml ] ) or bis-dethio-bis ( methylthio ) gliotoxin ( DGT [ 1 ug/m1 ] ) as described in the legend to Fig .

tial control of constitutive and inducible Fas expression and suggest an intervention strategy for inducible Fas upregulation .
Spl is a zinc-finger transcription factor constitutively expressed in a variety of cell types that binds the GC-rich consensus sequences ( KGGGCGGRRY or KRGGCGKRRY ) present in many cellular and viral promoters .
The N terminus of Sp1 contains glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich domains required for transactivation , while the C terminus is involved in synergistic activation and interaction with other transcription factors ( 12 ) .
Although Sp1 has been shown to independently initiate transcription in TATA-less promoters ( reviewed in reference 3 ) , it can also form homo- or heteromultimeric complexes to transactivate a number of disparate promoters , including interleukin 2 , VCAM-1 , and the HIV LTR ( 42 , 50 , 56 ) .
Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that Spl may be involved in basal fas transcription .
First , sequences proximal to the fas translational start site have a relatively high GC content ( 61 % between positions -590 and -1 ) and an absence of conventional TATA and CAAT boxes ( 5 ) , typical of a subclass of polymerase II-dependent promoters controlled by the interactions of the glutamine-rich activation domains of Sp1 with TFIID components ( 9 ) .
Second , the TATA-less , GC-rich area of the fas promoter ( -590 to -1 ) has been shown to be 2106 CHAN ET AL .
functional in analyses of transcriptional start sites ( 5 ) .
Third , the TATA-less A5 fas promoter construct was sufficient in driving basal transcription .
Fourth , Spl bound to the kB-Spl site at positions -295 to -286 in resting , but not activated , Jurkat cell extracts ( data not shown ) .
Finally , multimers of the kB-Sp1 element at positions -295 to -286 showed increase basal transcription in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
Although Sp1 may be involved in the control of fas transcription in resting Jurkat cells , it is likely that multiple Sp1 binding elements are required for optimal basal levels of Fas expression .
In this regard , site-directed mutagenesis of the xB-Sp1 site at -295 to -286 alone inhibited basal fas transcription by ~20 % , while disruption of a second consensus Sp1 site at -140 to -131 repressed basal fas transcription by greater than 50 % ( data not shown ) .
Nuclear translocation of the NF- « B-Rel transcription factor family occurs in T lymphocytes in response to TCR engagement ( reviewed in reference 20 ) .
The prototypic form of NF- « B is a heterodimer complex containing NF- « kB1-p50 or NF- « kB2-p52 in combination with a transactivating subunit such as c-Rel or RelA ( p65 ) ( reviewed in reference 64 ) .
Each NF- « xB-Rel family member contains a conserved N-terminal region responsible for decameric DNA binding , dimerization , and IxB interaction ; NF- « B-responsive genes are transacti-vated by the C-terminal domain of dimeric NF- « B-Rel family members .
In resting T lymphocytes , various NF- « B subunits are sequestered in the cytoplasm by virtue of their association with by the IxB family of inhibitors ( IxBa , IxBB , IxBg , IxBy , and bel-3 ) , which masks their nuclear localization signal ( reviewed in reference 64 ) .
During T-cell activation , intracellular signaling triggers multiple kinase pathways that converge in the activation of the IxB kinase complex ( IKK ) ; IKK then phos-phorylates IxBa or IxBB at conserved serines , resulting in the targeting of the kB inhibitor for ubiquitin-proteasome-depen-dent destruction and permitting the nuclear translocation of NF-kB ( 10 ) .
Binding sites for NF-kB have been found in numerous genes involved in effector T-cell function , including those regulating cytokine production , cell adhesion molecules , and apoptosis .
In this report , we have demonstrated that NF- « B p50-p65 mediates inducible fas promoter activation in T lymphocytes at -460 to -240 and confers the majority of P/I responsiveness at a single , noncanonical < B-Spl-like motif ( GGGCGTTCCC ) located at -295 to -286 .
Interestingly , although two consensus NF-KB sites as well as GAS , NF-ATp , AP-2 , and Egr-1 sites are also present within this region , the contribution of these elements to either basal or inducible fas promoter induction in Jurkat cells was insignificant ( Fig .
3 ) .
Notably , however , such motifs may be functional in other cell types , because Egr-1 binding at -371 to -338 has been reported to repress fas transcription during B-cell activation ( 16 ) .
The mutually exclusive binding of either Spl or NF-kB to the novel composite < B-Sp1 site at -295 to -286 in the fas promoter differs from the previously described cross-coupling of NF-kB with the transcription factor AP-1 or HMG I ( Y ) ( 58 , 62 ) .
Our observations are not unexpected , however , in light of reports documenting the functional interference of Spl and NF- « B at selected NF-kB binding sites ( 21 ) and crystallographic data showing that Sp1 and p50 homodimers both interact with DNA at the major groove ( 19 , 38 , 49 ) .
In this report , we provide multiple lines of evidence that NF- « B p50-p65 heterodimers displace Sp1 at the composite kB-Sp1 site to drive activation-dependent interaction of the fas promoter .
First , P/I-dependent promoter induction requires the sequences between -306 and -260 containing the kB-Sp1l site ( Fig .
3B ) .
Second , NF-kB p50-65 heterodimers bound to this region of the fas promoter only during activation ( Fig .
4A and B ) .
Third , recombinant NF- « B p50 displaced Sp1 binding to Mor .

the xB-Sp1 site in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
4C ) .
Fourth , recruitment of NF-kB to the fas promoter region at -295 to -286 was required for activation-dependent fas promoter induction , but not for basal activity ( Fig .
5 ) .
Fifth , specific mutagenesis of the NF-kB site at -295 to -286 significantly diminished P/I-dependent fas promoter induction ( Fig .
6A ) .
Finally , multimers of the « B-Sp1 site juxtaposed to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter were functionally responsive to P/I stimulation in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
6B ) .
In further support of our observations that NF- « B is critically required for activation-induced fas upregulation , several inducers of NF-kB , including UV irradiation , hypoxia , cytokines , and TNF , have been reported to rapidly upregulate Fas ( 24 , 44 , 61 ) .
It is interesting to speculate that Sp1 , bound to the kB-Sp1 site during basal transcription , may facilitate rapid activation-induced fas promoter responsiveness mediated by NF-kB translocation as a consequence of its role in DNA bending ( 57 ) .
If Fas is similarly regulated in Jurkat and fresh T cells , our findings may be relevant to HIV pathogenesis , in which increased Fas expression and sensitivity to FasL-induced apoptosis have been reported during infection and disease progression ( 2 , 4 , 27 ) .
Interestingly , both HIV-1 binding and gp120-mediated CD4 cross-linking can induce NF-kB ( 8 ) .
Because NF-kB can drive both HIV-1 expression ( 50 ) and fas upregulation , inhibition of NF-kB may be one major strategy to suppress both viral replication ( 31 ) and premature execution of the AICD pathway resulting in T-cell depletion .
Indeed , inhibitors of NF-kB may also effectively repress Fas-driven apoptosis in response to metabolic stress , genotoxic insults , and viral infections .
Although our studies clearly demonstrate a critical role for NF- « B in fas upregulation , other transcriptional or posttran-scriptional processes may also be operative , depending upon the cell type and cellular microenvironment .
For example , the proline- , glutamine- , and histidine-rich protein TDAGS1 has been reported to be critical for Fas mRNA induction after TCR engagement ( 47 ) .
Our laboratory has demonstrated that wild-type p53 can upregulate fas expression in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells ( 45 ) .
Taken with our current observations , it is plausible that p53 may act with NF- « B to increase fas transcription , particularly under conditions of metabolic and genotoxic stress .
mRNA stability may also regulate fas expression .
In this regard , the 3 ' untranslated region of fas contains several AU-rich elements reported to induce selective mRNA degradation ( 29 , 55 ) .
Given the potent biological function of the Fas protein , multiple levels of gene regulation involving both cis-acting transcription and mRNA stability would not be unexpected .
In summary , our studies have identified a novel kB-Spl enhancer motif in the fas promoter in which NF-kB p50-p65 dimers bind to drive activation-dependent Fas upregulation in T cells .
The critical involvement of NF-kB further underscores the importance of this transcription factor in immuno-homeostasis and prompts consideration for strategies aimed toward its manipulation in various pathophysiological states involving inappropriate Fas and FasL interactions , including malignant disease , autoimmunity , and AIDS .
