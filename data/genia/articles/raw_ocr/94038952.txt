12 no.12 pp.4685-4695 , 1993 In vivo control of NF-xB activation by IxBa Nancy R.Rice and Mary K.Ernst Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis , ABL-Basic Research Program , NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , MD 21702-1201 , USA Communicated by F.Blasi The transcription factor NF-xB is stored in the cytoplasm in complexes with the inhibitor protein IxBa .
It has been shown in vitro that dissociation of IxBa from these complexes results in active NF-xB .
In this report we show that lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced activation of B or pre-B cells results in loss of IxBa from NF-xB complexes in vivo .
Many liberated NF-xB dimers reached the nucleus , where increased c-re/ , p65 and p50 were detected by immunoblotting and by DNA binding assays .
Some liberated dimers were retained in the cytoplasm , however , through binding to newly synthesized IxBa , a finding which strongly suggests ( i ) that the LPS-induced signal causes dissociation of complexes rather than preventing their association and ( ii ) that dissociation results from modification of IxBa and not of c-rel or p65 .
No effect of LPS treatment was detected on p105 or p100 , which also retain re ?
family members in the cytoplasm .
Quite unexpectedly , we also found that in unstimulated cells there is a constant ongoing process of degradation and replacement of complexed IxBa .
We propose that this turnover results in the low level of active NF-xB presumably necessary even in the unstimulated cell , and that the high rate of synthesis of IxBa provides the ability to turn off NF-xB activity rapidly as soon as the activating signal ceases .
Key words : c-rel/lxBa/NF-xB/transcription factor/regulatory complexes Introduction Nuclear factor-xB ( NF-xB ) ( Sen and Baltimore , 19862 ) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of numerous genes , including many of those involved in immune or inflammatory responses ( for review , see Grilli et al. , 1993 ) .
As originally described , NF-xB was a heterodimer composed of a p50 and p65 subunit ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Ghosh and Baltimore , 1990 ) , but it is now known that there are five different proteins that can participate in dimer formation .
In addition to p50 and p65 , these are p52 , c-rel and rel B ( also called I-rel ) .
All are related over a stretch of ~300 amino acids to the c-rel oncogene and to the Drosophila morphogen dorsal ( Ballard et al. , 1990 ; Ghosh et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ; Neri et al. , 1991 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Ruben et al. , 1991 , 1992a ; Schmid et al. , 1991 ; Ryseck et al. , 1992 ) .
DNA-binding dimers can be homodimers ( except for rel B ) or many ( or perhaps all ) of the possible heterodimers [ see above references plus Inoue et al .
( 1991 ) , Urban et al .
( 1991 ) , Hansen et al .
( 1992 ) and Perkins et al .
( 1992 ) ] .
Transcriptional activation is due chiefly to p65 , c-rel and rel B ( Bull et al. , 1990 ; Inoue et al. , 1991 ; Schmitz and Bacuerle , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ; Ruben et al. , 1992b ; Ryseck et al. , 1992 ) although under certain conditions p50 homodimers can also transactivate ( Fujita et al. , 1992 ) .
NF-xB activity is constitutive in B cells and in some monocyte cell lines , but in most other cells it is very low or undetectable .
However , NF-xB activity can be rapidly induced in most cells by treatment with any of a variety of agents , e.g .
phorbol esters , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) or hydrogen peroxide ( for review see Grilli et al. , 1993 ) .
The fact that in most cases this induction does not require protein synthesis ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986b ; Hohmann et al. , 1991 ) led to the discovery that NF-xB is stored in inactive form in the cytoplasm ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1988 ) .
Storage of c-rel- and p65-containing dimers is accomplished through binding to one of several inhibitor proteins .
One of the inhibitors is the high molecular weight precursor to p50 ( Rice et al. , 1992 ) .
Both p50 and p52 are synthesized as inactive cytoplasmic precursors ( p105 and p100 , respectively ) , of which the N-terminal halves constitute the active DNA-binding form ( Bours et al. , 1990 , 1992 ; Ghosh et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ; Meyer et al. , 1991 ; Neri et al. , 1991 ; Schmid et al. , 1991 ) .
A significant fraction of p105 is bound to c-re/ or p65 , and these p105/c-rel and p105/p65 dimers are strictly cytoplasmic and unable to bind DNA .
Processing of p105 to p50 occurs slowly ( Fan and Maniatis , 1991 ) , but gradually leads to the appearance of p50/p65 and p50/rel dimers ( Rice et al. , 1992 ) .
Whether the rate of processing is influenced by stimulation of the cell is not yet clear .
In a similar manner , p100 , the precursor of p52 , also retains c-rel and p65 in the cytoplasm ( Mercurio et al. , 1993 ) .
The most extensively studied inhibitor of the rel family proteins is IxBax , the product of the MAD-3 gene ( Haskill et al. , 1991 ) and the human homolog of chicken pp4O ( Davis et al. , 1991 ) and rat RL/IF-1 ( Tewari et al. , 1992 ) .
In vitro , it binds efficiently to c-re/ , p65 and rel B and prevents DNA binding by their homo- or heterodimers ( Zabel and Baeuerle , 1990 ; Kerr et al. , 1991 ; Wulezyn et al. , 1992 ) .
It also binds to p50 homodimers but does not prevent their binding to DNA ( Beg et al. , 1992 ) .
Cytoplasmic IxBa complexes are thought to be major targets in signal transduction pathways .
It is known that phosphorylation of IxBa in vitro prevents its binding to rel and to p50/p65 ( Shirakawa and Mizel , 1989 ; Ghosh and Baltimore , 1990 ; Kerr et al. , 1991 ) and it is presumed that phosphorylation regulates association in vivo as well .
Whatever the precise mechanism , the working hypothesis is that stimulation of the cell results in loss of IxBa from cytoplasmic complexes , transport of rel family proteins to the nucleus , followed by DNA binding and gene activation .
Consistent with this scenario , stimulation of cells with agents such as TNFa results in the rapid disappearance 4685 N.R.Rice and M.K.Ernst of IxBa , as monitored by immunoblotting ( Brown et al. , 1993 ; Sun et al. , 1993 ) .
In this paper we examine IxBa-containing complexes directly , by immunoprecipitation .
We show that lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of murine B and pre-B cells results in loss of IxBa from all pre-existing c-re/-and p65-containing dimers , in accordance with the working model .
Some but not all of the liberated c-re/ and p65 translocates to the nucleus and exhibits DNA-binding activity .
The remaining c-rel and p65 are captured by newly synthesized IxBa and retained in the cytoplasm , a result which strongly suggests that complexes dissociate because of modification of IxBa , not of c-rel or p65 .
We also examine IxBa complexes in unstimulated cells and find a quite unexpected dynamism .
While c-re/ and p65 are stable proteins , complexed IxBa turns over with a half-life of 30-60 min in a variety of cell lines .
We propose that this turnover results in the low level of active NF-xB that is presumably necessary even in the unstimulated cell .
In addition , we suggest that the high rate of synthesis of IxBa relative to that of rel family members provides the ability to turn off NF-xB activity rapidly as soon as the activating signal ceases .
Results Activation of cells results in dissociation of IxBa To test the effect of cellular stimulation on IxBa , we determined the response of the murine B cell line WEHI 231 and of the murine pre-B cell line 70Z/3 to bacterial LPS , an effective activator of these cells ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986b ) .
Cells were grown in *°S-containing medium for 1 h , and then in non-radioactive medium with or without LPS .
We asked whether [ *°S ] IxBa would be lost from rel family complexes during incubation of the cells in LPS .
To examine the 702/3 cells , cytoplasmic extract was immunoprecipitated with both anti-c-re/ and anti-p65 ( see Figure 1 for description of antisera ) .
The washed precipitate was released from antibody by incubation in excess competing peptides and the eluted ( c-re/- and p65-containing ) material was reprecipitated as indicated in Figure 2A .
In cells chased for 90 min without LPS , both anti-c-re/ ( lane 1 ) and anti-p65 ( lane 2 ) precipitated [ *°S ] IxBa , as expected , and anti-IxBa precipitated *°S-labeled IxBa , c-re/ and p65 ( lane 3 ) .
In LPS-treated cells , however , neither anti-c-re/ ( lane 4 ) nor anti-p65 ( lane 5 ) precipitated [ *°S ) ] IxBa , and anti-lxBa precipitated only a trace of [ * '' SJe-rel or p65 ( lane 6 ) .
Thus , LPS treatment of the 70 % /3 pre-B cells resulted in loss of [ *°S ] lxBa from c-rel- and p65-containing complexes .
At the same time , the amount of precipitable cytoplasmic c-re/ and p65 declined somewhat after LPS treatment ( compare lane 1 with lane 4 , and lane 2 with lane 5 ) .
This suggests that the c-re/ and p65 released from IxBa left the cytoplasm , where they had constituted a significant fraction of total c-rel and p65 .
There are two additional points to be made about this experiment .
First , while the amount of [ *SJce-rel and [ } ° $ ] p65 precipitable by anti-IxBa after LPS treatment was very low , it was not zero ( lane 6 ) .
We wondered whether this low level represented incomplete dissociation of *°S-labeled complexes or whether it reflected binding of newly synthesized ( and hence non-radioactive ) IxBa to c-re/ and p65 .
To test this , LPS treatment was carried out in the presence of cycloheximide .
The result was that precipitation of [ } SlJce-rel or [ *S ] p65 by anti-lxBa was abolished ( lane 10 ) .
Thus , synthesis of IxBa proceeds in the presence of LPS , and new IxBa is able to associate with previously synthesized [ *SJc-rel or [ *°S ] p65 .
Second , this experiment suggests that LPS treatment for 90 min has little effect on processing of p105 and/or p100 .
In the untreated cells , both the c-re/ precipitate ( lane 1 ) and the p65 precipitate ( lane 2 ) contained a protein ( s ) migrating -IH-H-AA 1050 1051 1266 m-rel-I m-rel-I m-rel-C Murine c-rel : | 1158 I rel-I I Human c-re ! }

Antisera .
The diagram shows the peptide antisera used in these experiments .
In the text each is referred to generically ( e.g .
anti-c-re/ , anti-p65 , etc .
) , then by its specific number ( e.g .
# 1158 , # 1266 , # 1207 , etc .
) , then by its description ( e.g .
m-re/-I , for murine c-rel internal ; m-rel-C , for murine C-terminal ; or 65-N , for p65 N-terminal ) .
Those sera without an 'm ' or ' h ' in their descriptive name recognize murine and human proteins .
Each serum is specific for its protein and does not cross-react with other family members .
4686 at the position expected of p105 and p100 ( which co-migrate under our conditions ) .
This protein ( s ) was also present , in about the same amounts , after LPS treatment ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Thus , of the known inhibitors that bind to c-rel and p65 , the major effect of LPS is on IxBa .
Of course we can not rule out the possibility that longer treatment or a different stimulus might also accelerate processing , as reported for phorbol ester treatment of HeLa cells ( Mercurio et al. , 1993 ) .
To test whether these results are unique to 702/3 cells , a similar experiment was performed with WEHI 231 cells , where levels of the proteins of interest are much higher .
With one exception , results were much like those seen with 7027/3 cells .
As above , WEHI 231 cells were grown in S-containing medium , then in non-radioactive medium with A Fig .

LPS results in loss of IxBa .
( A ) 702/3 cells were grown for 1 h in medium containing [ *5S ) methionine and ( each at 100 Ci per ml ) .
Excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine were then added , and the cells were diluted 10-fold into complete medium containing LPS ( 15 pg/ml ) , LPS plus cycloheximide ( 20 pg/ml ! )
or no additives .
After 90 min , cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with a combination of anti-c-re/ ( # 1051 , m-re/-I ) and anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ) .
The precipitates were eluted with excess peptides , and the eluates were reprecipitated with anti-c-re/ ( # 1050 , m-re/-D , anti-p65 ( # 1207 , 65-N ) or anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3C ) , as indicated , and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Each lane contains the precipitate from ~10 '' cells .
The film was exposed for 30 days .
( B ) WEHI 231 cells were treated as in ( A ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-re/ ( # 1050 , m-re/-D ) .
Precipitates were eluted with peptide , and eluates were reprecipitated with anti-c-re/ ( # 1051 , m-rel-D ) , anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3-C ) or anti-p105 ( # 1263 , m-105-N ) , as indicated .
Each lane contains the preciptate from ~10 '' cells .
The film was exposed for 3 days .
Instability of IxBa complexes and without LPS .
Cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-re/ , precipitates were eluted with peptide , and eluates were reprecipitated as shown in Figure 2B .
In extracts from the untreated cells , anti-c-re/ precipitated [ *°S ] IxBa ( lane 1 ) and anti-IxBa precipitated and [ *°SJc-rel ( lane 2 ) , just as in the 70Z/3 experiment .
LPS treatment resulted in the loss of [ *°S ] lxBa from the rel precipitate ( lane 4 ) , but , unlike the result with 702/3 cells , anti-lxBa was still able to precipitate considerable ( lane 5 ) .
Thus , while LPS caused the loss of [ *°S ] IxBa , replacement by new unlabeled IxBa must have been so rapid that much of the temporarily liberated [ *S ) c-re/ remained precipitable by anti-IxBa .
As above , this interpretation was confirmed by treating with LPS in the presence of cycloheximide .
Under those conditions , not only did [ 3°S ] IxBa dissociate from c-rel ( lane 7 ) , but also anti-IxBa was unable to precipitate ( lane 8 ) .
Thus , as in 7027/3 cells , synthesis of IxBa continued in the presence of LPS , and newly synthesized molecules were able to associate with pre-existing but newly liberated [ *°SJc-rel .
This strongly suggests ( i ) that the LPS signal affects IxBa complexes rather than free IxBa , i.e .
the signal causes disruption of complexes rather than preventing their formation , and ( ii ) that disruption results from some change to IxBa , not to c-rel , since [ *°S } c-rel remained able to bind to new inhibitor molecules .
In addition , this experiment shows that translocation to the nucleus is not a necessary consequence of every dissociation event .
If new IxBa is synthesized at a high enough rate [ and 90 min exposure to at least some activating agents is sufficient to increase the level of IxBa mRNA significantly ( Haskill et al. , 1991 ; Brown et al. , 1993 ; Sun et al .
, 1993 ) ] dissociated rel and/or p65 may be efficiently recaptured and retained in the cytoplasm .
We wondered whether the [ *°S ] lxBa that disappears from c-rel complexes in response to LPS could be found as free molecules .
This was tested by exhaustively precipitating the cytoplasmic extract from LPS-treated WEHI 231 cells with anti-c-re/ and anti-p65 , and then looking for [ *5S ] IxBa : in the supernatant .
None was detectable ( data not shown ) , suggesting that it had been degraded .
The same result was obtained with two different IxBa antibodies , neither of which was directed at a region with a potential phosphorylation site .
As with the 702/3 cells , there was no obvious effect of LPS treatment on processing of pre-existing p105 .
A high molecular weight protein ( s ) coprecipitated with c-rel in both untreated and LPS-treated cells ( lanes 1 and 4 ) ; presumably it represents a combination of p105 and p100 .
When the rel-containing complexes were reprecipitated with anti-p105 , bands of similar intensity were seen in treated ( lane 6 ) and untreated ( lane 3 ) cells .
LPS treatment increases nuclear c-rel and p6S The preceding experiments showed that LPS treatment resulted in loss of IxBa from c-re/-containing cytoplasmic complexes .
We next tested whether dissociation outpaced replacement sufficiently to allow some liberated complexes to reach the nucleus .
702 % /3 cells were treated with LPS , and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were assayed by immunoblotting ( Figure 3A ) .
In untreated cells there was little nuclear p50 , p65 or c-rel , but the level of all three increased significantly upon LPS treatment .
Most p50 and p6S remained in the cytoplasm even after treatment 4687 tam o Fig .

Effect of LPS on nuclear c-re/ and p65 and on DNA-binding activity .
( A ) 702/3 cells were treated with LPS ( 15 ug/ml ! )
for 85 min or were left untreated .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were assayed by immunoblotting using anti-c-re/ ( # 1050 , m-re/-D , anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ) or anti-p50 ( # 1157 , 105-1 ) .
Each lane contains extract from 2.6 % 106 cells ( rel , p65 ) or 1.4 x 106 cells ( pSO ) .
( B ) 702/3 and WEHI 231 cells were treated with LPS ( 10 ug/ml ! )
for 90 min .
Nuclear extracts from treated and untreated cells were assayed for ability to bind to a +°P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the murine kappa chain intronic xB site .
Unbound probe migrated to the bottom of the gel and is not shown in the figure .
( C ) 702/3 cells were treated with LPS , and nuclear extracts were assayed as in ( B ) .
Prior to incubation with the 32P-labeled probe , samples were incubated with anti-c-re/ ( # 1051 , m-rel-I , lane 3 ; or # 1266 , m-rel-C , lane 9 ) , anti-p50 ( # 1263 , m-105-N ; lane 4 ) or anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ; lane 6 ) .
Samples in lanes 5 and 10 contained 32P-labeled probe and antiserum , but no nuclear extract .
For lanes 2 and 8 , the incubation mixture included a 40-fold molar excess of unlabeled xB oligonucleotide .
( D ) Nuclear extract from WEHI 231 cells was assayed for DNA-binding activity using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the IL-6 xB site .
Prior to addition of the 32P-labeled probe , extracts were incubated with anti-c-re/ ( # 1266 , m-rel-C ; lane 3 ) , anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ; lane 4 ) or anti-p50 ( # 1263 , m-105-N ; lane 5 ) .
The sample in lane 6 contained P-labeled probe and anti-c-rel , but no nuclear extract .
For lane 2 , the incubation mixture included a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled xB oligonucleotide .
( reflecting not only IxBa-containing complexes , but those significantly more binding activity in LPS-stimulated than with p105 and p100 as well ) , but the amount of c-re !
is low in unstimulated 702/3 cells ( Figure 3B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In enough in these cells that transport to the nucleus diminished contrast , WEHI 231 cells had a high level of activity in the cytoplasmic level noticeably .
With WEHI 231 cells the unstimulated cells [ as has been reported previously ( Sen and results were similar , except that even untreated cells had Baltimore , 1986b ; Inoue et al. , 1991 ) ] .
This constitutive some nuclear c-re/ and p50 .
The levels of nuclear c-re/ and level was so high that it did not increase significantly upon p65 were increased appreciably by LPS treatment ( data not LPS treatment ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , in spite of the fact that shown ) .
immunoblot analysis had shown increased nuclear c-re/ and p65 in LPS-treated cells .
LPS-induced DNA binding activity To determine the composition of the DNA binding We next tested whether the increased level of nuclear rel complexes , their reactivity with various rel family antisera family members would be reflected in increased DNA was tested .
Both of the prominent bands produced by the binding activity .
702/3 and WEHI 231 cells were treated 7027/3 extracts were shifted by anti-p50 ( Figure 3C , lane 4 ) , with LPS for 90 min , and nuclear extracts were assayed for while only the upper band was shifted by anti-p65 ( lane 6 ) .
their ability to bind to the xB site from the intron enhancer Anti-c-rel had little or no effect on the bound complexes of the murine kappa light chain gene .
In agreement with ( lane 3 ) .
In a second experiment using a different anti-c-re/ results of others ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986b ) , there was serum , however , a small amount of shifted material was seen 4688 Instability of IxBa complexes Fig .

IxBa has a short half-life .
( A ) WEHI 231 cells were grown for 1 h in medium containing [ 35S ) Jmethionine and [ 35S ) cysteine ( each at 100 uCi per ml ) .
Cells were pelleted , resuspended in non-radioactive complete medium , and incubated at 37°C for the indicated times .
Whole cell extracts were adjusted to 1 % SDS and 0.5 % B-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min .
After diluting at least 4-fold with TNT-E buffer , aliquots were immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3-C ) .
The sample shown in lane 2 contained competing peptide 1258 .
Each lane contains precipitate from ~3 x 106 cells and the film was exposed for 6 days .
( B ) Jurkat cells were treated as in A , except that the *5S-containing medium was not removed following the labeling period .
Instead , excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine were added , and cells were diluted 5-fold into complete medium .
To reduce background on the gel , immunoprecipitation was performed in two steps .
Lysate ( obtained as in A ) was precipitated with anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3-C ) .
Precipitates were washed with TNT buffer , boiled in 1 % SDS for 5 min , diluted at least 4-fold with TNT and then reprecipitated with fresh anti-IxBa .
Samples in lanes 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 contained competing peptide 1258 during the second precipitation .
Each lane contains precipitate from ~9 x 106 cells , and the film was exposed for 7 days .
( lane 9 , arrow ) .
Thus , the upper band must be composed predominantly of a p50/p65 heterodimer , but may also contain some c-rel/p50 , while the lower band is either a p50/p50 homodimer or a p50/pS52 heterodimer ( or both ) .
In contrast , c-ref in WEHI 231 nuclear extracts bound very well to xB-containing probes .
A significant fraction of the total bound complex was shifted by anti-c-re/ ( Figure 3D , lane 3 ) , while little or none was shifted by anti-p65 ( lane 4 ) .
All of it was shifted by anti-p50 ( lane 5 ) .
Thus WEHI 231 extracts contain a prominent p50/c-rel heterodimer , as well as other unidentified p50-containing complexes ( with rel B ?
p52 ? ) .
There was no change in this pattern with extracts from LPS-treated cells : the nuclear p65 detected by immunoblot analysis did not contribute significantly to the total DNA-binding activity ( data not shown ) .
In summary , LPS treatment of 7027/3 and WEHI 231 cells resulted in loss of IxBa from all pre-existing c-re/- or p65-containing complexes .
Most , but not all , of the liberated c-rel and p65 was transported to the nucleus in 702/3 cells , where they were detectable both by immunoblotting and by DNA binding assays .
In WEHI 231 cells some of the liberated c-rel and p65 reached the nucleus , but most appeared to be bound to newly synthesized IxBa and retained in the cytoplasm .
IxBa has a short half-life The preceding experiments showed that disruption of IxBa complexes occurred upon activation of the cell .
We wondered whether dissociation also occurs at a lower but significant rate in the unstimulated cell .
This question was prompted by the observations that in pre-B cells cycloheximide alone results in both nuclear xB binding activity ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986b ) and transcription of the kappa light chain gene ( Wall et al. , 1986 ) .
Both of these studies suggest that there is a short-lived protein inhibitor of kappa gene expression .
If the labile protein is IxBa , then dissociation of IxBa complexes may be a frequent occurrence and not limited to periods of cellular activation .
To investigate the stability of IxBa , WEHI 231 cells were grown in medium containing [ °*°S ) methionine and [ } 5S } cysteine for 1 h and then in non-radioactive medium for varying times .
Total cell extract was boiled in SDS , precipitated with anti-IxBa and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
The intensely labeled protein band seen in the pulse-labeled sample ( Figure 4A , lane 1 ) was nearly gone after 2 h of chase ( lane 3 ) and continued to decline thereafter ( lanes 4-6 ) .
The same result was obtained with three different IxBa antibodies directed at different regions of the protein .
This result shows that in these murine B cells total cellular IxBa turns over very rapidly .
From multiple experiments we estimate a half-life of ~30 min .
To determine whether this result is unique to B cells , in which NF-xB is active constitutively , similar experiments were performed with the murine pre-B cell line 702 % /3 ( propagated in either serum-free or serum-containing medium ) , the human plasmacytoma cell line Sultan , the human T cell line Jurkat and the human epithelial cell line HeLa .
The results showed that IxBa turns over rapidly in these cells as well .
In all cases the half-life of IxBa was ~1 h ( Figure 4B and data not shown ) .
Most IxBa is complexed to rel and/or p65 The preceding experiments measured the stability of total cellular IxBa .
They leave open the possibility that there is a rapidly turning over pool of free IxBa , while complexed IxBa is quite stable .
To determine the relative amounts of free versus complexed IxBa , we examined 702/3 and Jurkat lysates from which all c-re/ and p65 had been removed .
35S-labeled cytoplasmic extracts were exhaustively immunoprecipitated with anti-c-rel and anti-p65 , and the amount of precipitable [ *°S ] IxBa in the supernatant was compared with that in non-depleted lysates .
The result was 4689 N.R.Rice and M.K.Emmst Fig .
5 .
Most IxBa exists in complexed form .
702/3 or Jurkat cells were grown in 35S-containing medium for 1 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were divided in half .
One half was treated with excess anti-c-re/ ( # 1050 , m-rel-I ; or # 1135 , h-rel-I ) and excess anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ) ; the other half was treated with the same volume of an irrelevant antiserum .
After discarding the precipitates , the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3-C ) .
To reduce the background this was done twice .
The first precipitates were washed , boiled in 1 % SDS , diluted and reprecipitated with fresh anti-IxBa .
In order to quantify the amount of IxBa in the immunodepleted extracts , the intensity of the precipitated sample ( lane 5 for 702/3 , lane 13 for Jurkat ) was compared with that in several different amounts of the control extract ( lanes 1-4 ) for 702/3 , lanes 8-11 for Jurkat ) .
In both cases the immunodepleted samples contained IxBax at only ~15 % of the level seen in the controls .
Precipitations for lanes 6 and 12 were performed in the presence of competing IxBa peptide .
Samples in lanes 7 and 14 were precipitated twice with anti-p105 ( # 1140 , 105-C ) instead of anti-IxBa .
Since a strong p105 band remains in the immunodepleted sample ( lane 14 ) , the loss of most IxBa can not be attributed to nonspecific effects of incubation with the c-rel and p65 antisera .
that most IxBa was bound to c-rel or p65 ; treating the lysate with anti-c-rel and anti-p65 removed about 85 % of the total IxBa ( Figure 5 ) .
We regard this as a minimum estimate of bound IxBa since additional molecules may be bound to p50 homodimers ( Beg et al. , 1992 ; Zabel et al. , 1993 ) , which were not removed in these experiments .
In fact , in a similar study with WEHI 231 cells , the small amount of IxBa not precipitable by anti-c-re/ and anti-p65 was precipitated by anti-p50 ( data not shown ) .
Thus , in a pre-B , a T cell and a B cell line , almost all IxBa is complexed rather than free .
Complexed IxBa also turns over rapidly The observation that most IxBa is bound and that total IxBa has a short half-life necessarily implies that bound IxBa turns over rapidly .
To test this prediction , a specific subset of c-rel-containing complexes was examined in a pulse-chase experiment .
WEHI 231 cells were labeled , chased for various times and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-rel .
The washed precipitates were released from antibody by incubation in excess competing peptide , and the eluted ( c-rel-containing ) material was reprecipitated with anti-p65 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Since each sample was precipitated sequentially with anti-c-rel and anti-p65 , each lane of the resulting gel shows complexes that contain both c-rel and p65 ( Figure 6A ) .
In these complexes both [ *°SJc-rel and [ *°S ] p65 were quite stable over the course of 22 h , suggesting that they associated with each other at or soon after synthesis , and that they remained associated throughout the experiment .
In contrast , **S-labeled IxBa declined 4690 rapidly .
The intense band seen in the pulse-labeled sample ( Figure 6A , lane 1 ) was much reduced after a 2 h chase ( lane 2 ) and was almost gone after 5 h ( lane 3 ) .
Thus , the association between newly synthesized IxBa and the c-rel/p65 complex was not stable , for the disappeared with a short half-life .
Next we tested whether the displaced [ *°S ] lxBa is replaced with new IxBa molecules .
As in the preceding experiment , c-re/-containing complexes were collected at each time point .
These were reprecipitated with anti-IxBa and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Thus , the gel shows only those complexes that contained both c-re/l and IxBa ( Figure 6B ) .
As in Figure 6A , pulse-labeled was stable , while [ *°S ] IxBa declined rapidly .
However , the fact that anti-IxBa precipitated c-rel even after [ °°S ] IxBa had almost disappeared ( Figure 6B , lanes 4 and 5 ) shows that new unlabeled IxBa replaced the lost labeled molecules .
This conclusion was confirmed by chasing in the presence of cycloheximide ( Figure 6C ) .
The result was that after a 90 min chase anti-IxBa was unable to precipitate [ *°S ) re/-containing complexes ( compare the c-re/ band in lanes 2 and 4 ) .
Thus , complexed IxBa is unstable .
Even in unstimulated B cells it is frequently lost from c-re/- and p65-containing complexes and is replaced by a newer molecule .
There are two further predictions .
First , in c-re/-IxBa complexes , the incorporation of °°S by IxBa and that by c-rel should reflect not only their contents of methionine plus cysteine but also their differing half-lives .
In fact , the intensity of the IxBa band in Figure 6B , lane 1 , is significantly greater than that of c-re/ .
The labeling period in that experiment was 1 h ( which is two half-lives of IxBa ) , so substantial turnover of newly synthesized molecules occurred during that time .
When cells were labeled for only 10 min , the difference in incorporation between IxBa and c-rel was greatly magnified ( to at least a factor of 5 ) , as expected ( data not shown ) .
Second , treatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor would be expected to increase nuclear c-re/ and p65 , as old IxBa decays but synthesis of new IxBa is blocked .
To test this , WEHI 231 cells were incubated in cycloheximide for varying times , and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting ( Figure 6D ) .
The results showed relatively little nuclear c-re/ or p65 after 15 or 50 min of treatment , but a significantly increased level after 3 h in the presence of cycloheximide .
There is a substantial amount of nuclear p50 in untreated cells , and this level also increased somewhat after 3 h treatment .
( We have observed repeatedly that cycloheximide at 20 ug/ml does not inhibit protein synthesis completely ; this may account for the lack of response after 50 min treatment . )
Thus , cycloheximide blocks synthesis of most IxBa ( Figures 2A and B and 6C ) and results in increased levels of nuclear c-re/ , p65 and p50 .
This is consistent with the model of unstable association of IxBa with rel family complexes .
The rapid turnover of bound IxBa is not unique to B cells .
In a pulse-chase experiment with 7027/3 pre-B cells we examined complexes containing IxBa and c-re/ or p65 .
The result was qualitatively the same as that with B cells .
A constant level of *5S-labeled c-re/ or p65 was associated with IxBa , but [ °°S } lxBa declined with a half-life of ~1 h ( see below ) .
Thus , even in non-B cells IxBa complexes are dynamic .

Complexed IxBa turns over rapidly .
( A ) WEHI 231 cells were labeled and chased as detailed in the legend to Figure 5 .
Cells were lysed in TNT buffer , and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-re/ ( # 1051 , m-rel-I ) .
Precipitates were washed and then released from antibody by incubation with excess competing peptide 1051 .
Eluates were reprecipitated with anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
( B ) WEHI 231 cells were labeled and chased , and lysates were immunoprecipitated and eluted with anti-c-re/ and peptide 1051 , respectively , as in ( A ) .
Eluates were reprecipitated with anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3C ) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
( C ) WEHI 231 cells were 3°S-labeled and chased for 90 min with ( lanes 3 and 4 ) or without ( lanes 1 and 2 ) cycloheximide at 20 pg/ml .
Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-re/ ( # 1050 , m-re/-1 ) , eluted with peptide 1050 , and reprecipitated with anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3C ) .
In parts A , B and C , each lane contains precipitate from ~10 '' cells and the films were exposed for 3-5 days .
( D ) WEHI 231 cells were incubated in complete medium plus cycloheximide ( 20 pg/ml ! )
for 15 min , 50 min or 3 h. For each time , nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-rel ( # 1158 , re/-D , anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ) or anti-p50 ( # 1157 , 105-1 ) .
Each lane contains extract from ~5 x 105 cells .
replaced by a newer molecule .
Since the decay rate mirrors the turnover rate of total IxBa , the lost molecule is most likely degraded .
IxBa turnover in the presence of LPS The preceding experiments have shown that in unstimulated cells nearly all IxBa is complexed with rel family members and that it turns over rapidly ( half-life 30-60 min ) .
They also demonstrated that treatment with an activating agent accelerates this normal process : all pre-existing IxBa disappeared from rel-containing complexes by 90 min after addition of LPS .
These findings predict that the turnover time of IxBa should be reduced in LPS-treated cells .
To test this , 702/3 cells were incubated for 3 h with or without LPS , then for 45 min and chased in non-radioactive medium for varying times .
( The LPS-treated cells also received LPS during the labeling and chase periods . )
c-rel- and p6S-containing complexes were precipitated , eluted with peptides and reprecipitated with anti-IxBa .
The resulting gel therefore shows only those complexes containing IxBa and c-re/ and/or p65 ( Figure 7 ) .
The result was a noticeable decrease in the turnover time of bound [ 3°S ] IlxBa in LPS-treated cells .
Its half-life in untreated cells was ~1 h ( lanes 1-4 ) , but it was considerably less than that in LPS-treated cells ( lanes 5-8 ) .
Examining total rather than bound IxBa gave the same result ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the half-life of IxBa , already short in 4691 Fig .

Turnover of IxBa in the presence of LPS .
702/3 cells were grown with or without LPS ( 15 pg/ml ) for 3 h , labeled in medium containing and [ 3°S ] cysteine ( 100 gCi/ml each ) for 45 min and then chased as described in the legend to Figure 4B .
The LPS-treated cells also received LPS during the labeling and chase periods .
Cytoplasmic extracts were precipitated with combined anti-c-rel ( # 1051 , m-rel-I ) and anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ) .
Precipitates were eluted with peptides 1051 and 1226 , and eluates were reprecipitated with anti-IxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3-C ) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Each lane contains the precipitate from ~2 x 10 '' cells , and the film was exposed for 3 weeks .
The identity of the 80 kDa band is unknown ; the protein at 45 kDa is most likely p50 .

Stability of IxBa in transfected cells Two recent papers examined the stability of IxBa in cells transfected with expression vectors encoding IxBa and/or p65 ( Scott et al. , 1993 ; Sun et al .
, 1993 ) .
When transfected alone , the half-life of IxBa was found to be 30-40 min .
However , when cotransfected with p65 , or when induced by overexpression of p65 , IxBa was very stable , with a half-life of many hours .
These results led to the conclusion that while free IxBa turns over rapidly , bound IxBa does not .
Yet our experiments reported above showed that complexed IxBa is unstable .
We have therefore tested whether this difference is attributable to experimental methodology or to the use of transfected versus non-transfected cells .
We transfected cells with IxBa DNA with or without p65 DNA , and we examined the stability of IxBa protein using the two-step immunoprecipitation protocols detailed above .
The results are in complete agreement with those of Sun et al .
( 1993 ) and Scott et al .
( 1993 ) .
In a pulse-chase experiment , transfected IxBa had a half-life of less than 1 h and was only barely detectable after 2 h ( Figure 8 , top panel ) .
In contrast , IxBa was much more stable when cotransfected with p65 .
This was true regardless of whether immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-IxBa alone ( Figure 8 , panel a ) , or with sequential anti-IxBa and anti-p65 ( panel b ) .
In a separate experiment we examined the stability of IxBa induced by overexpression of transfected p65 .
Just as shown by Scott et al .
( 1993 ) , the induced IxBa was very stable , with no detectable decrease after a 7 h chase ( data not shown ) .
Thus , there is a real difference in the stability of IxBa in transfected versus non-transfected cells , 4692 Fig .

Stability of IxBa in transfected cells .
Human 293 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding IxBa ( Haskill et al. , 1991 ) with or without a second expression vector encoding p65 ( Ruben et al. , 1992b ) .
48 h later , cells were grown in medium containing [ 35SJmethionine for 1 h and then chased in non-radioactive medium for the indicated times .
Top panel : cytoplasmic extracts from cells transfected with IxBa were immunoprecipitated with anti-lxBa ( # 1258 , MAD-3-C ) .
Precipitates were boiled and reprecipitated with fresh serum , as described in the legend to Figure 4B .
Middle panel : cytoplasmic extracts from cells cotransfected with IxBa and p65 were immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa , boiled and then reprecipitated with fresh anti-IxBa , as above .
Bottom panel : cytoplasmic extracts from cotransfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa .
The precipitate was eluted from antibody with excess peptide , and the eluted material was precipitated with anti-p65 ( # 1226 , 65-C ) .
Precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Only the portion of the gel containing IxBa is shown .
presumably resulting from the sustained high level expression in the former .
Discussion We report here on two key features of IxBa regulation of NF-xB in the unstimulated cell .
First , we showed that essentially all IxBa is complexed to rel family members in the cytoplasm : there is little or no free IxBa .
Second , in contrast to c-rel or p65 , IxBa is unstable , turning over with a half-life of ~30 min ( WEHI 231 B cells ) to 60 min ( various non-B cell lines ) .
This implied that complexes themselves are unstable , with frequent dissociation and/or degradation of the IxBa-and we were able to demonstrate this directly .
Synthesis of new IxBa is rapid enough that most liberated rel family dimers are efficiently captured by new IxBa and retained in the cytoplasm .
The experiments reported here also reveal aspects of IxBa regulation in the activated cell .
First , in response to LPS , all previously synthesized IxBa was gradually lost from rel-and p65-containing complexes in both WEHI 231 and 702/3 cells .
Since the lost IxBa was not detectable by immunoprecipitation , it was probably rapidly degraded .
Dissociation of complexes was correlated with the appearance of rel family members in the nucleus .
These results complement those from recent experiments using TNFa , where treatment resulted in maximal nuclear xB-binding activity after only a few minutes .
The level of total cellular IxBa was monitored by immunoblotting and was found to decline drastically almost immediately , correlating nicely with the rapid rise in DNA-binding activity ( Brown et al. , 1993 ; Sun et al. , 1993 ) .
While this manuscript was being reviewed , two additional studies documented the loss of IxBa following treatment of cells with various activating agents , including LPS ( Beg et al. , 1993 ; Cordle et al. , 1993 ) .
Second , during the relatively slow LPS-induced process , some of the lost IxBa molecules were replaced with newly synthesized ones : even after 90 min of treatment , anti-IxBa still precipitated some previously synthesized c-re/ and p65 , even though all of the old IxBa had disappeared .
Thus even during stimulation of the cell , not every dissociation event results in nuclear translocation .
Rather , the high rate of IxBa synthesis results in modulation of the response to LPS and prevents an all-out migration to the nucleus .
These competing processes of association and dissociation may be detectable only with a relatively weak activator such as LPS .
With a strong signal such as TNFa ( Hohmann et al. , 1990 ) , the speed and extent of the reaction may preclude their observation , at least initially .
Third , the fact that some liberated dimers were able to associate with newly synthesized IxBa strongly suggests that the LPS-induced signal causes disruption of complexes rather than preventing their association , and that complexes are broken due to modification of IxBa , and not of the dimers .
We wish now to consider the unstimulated cell in more detail .
First , why is there little or no free IxBa in the unstimulated cell ?
Excess inhibitor could interfere with response to an activating signal , so the advantage of this arrangement is evident .
But how is the precise balance between NF-xB and IxBa maintained ?
Roughly coordinated rates of synthesis are probably involved , but it is also possible that free IxBa ( i.e .
never complexed , as distinguished from dissociated ) is more unstable than complexed IxBax , just as indicated by the transfection experiments ( Figure 8 ; Scott et al. , 1993 ; Sun etal. , 1993 ) .
It is not clear why cotransfected IxBa is so stable relative to the endogenous IxBa in the various cell lines we examined .
However , if the transfected cells accurately reflect the normal ratio of the half-lives of complexed versus free IxBax , then free IxBa in non-transfected cells may survive for only a few minutes at most .
Why is complexed IxBa unstable ?
( i ) Perhaps the association between rel family members and IxBa is not strong .
In that case occasional dissociation events might result in free IxBa being recognized and degraded .
We do not favor this explanation even though there is no direct evidence to rule it out .
In our experience isolated IxBa & -containing complexes are stable for days and survive multiple purification procedures .
( ii ) Perhaps complexed IxBa is inherently unstable due to some feature of its structure that marks it for rapid turnover .
In that case we need not invoke a separate dissociation event , but only recognition and degradation .
However , this theory requires a second mechanism to account for the response of IxBa to activating signals .
( iii ) Alternatively , perhaps the complexed molecule is stable until it is modified in some way by normal cellular processes .
For example , perhaps the kinase that phosphorylates IxBa in an activated cell operates constitutively at a low level in the unstimulated cell .
Phosphorylation of IxBa might result in its recognition and degradation , perhaps following its dissociation from the complex .
This is an attractive hypothesis because it postulates Instability of IxBa complexes a single mechanism to account for events in both the unstimulated and the activated cell , but there is as yet no evidence to support it .
Whatever the basis for IxBa 's instability in the cell lines examined here , there is no a prior ?
reason to think that all cells have such unstable IxBa .
For example , if the hypothetical kinase mentioned above has little or no constitutive activity , complexed IxBa might be more stable .
On the other hand it is important to stress that the results we present are not limited to the WEHI 231 B cell line , but pertain to a pre-B , a T , a plasmacytoma and an epithelial cell line as well .
The cost of maintaining this system is considerable .
A 1 h half-life for IxBa means that it will be replaced in half of all the complexes every hour , even in the absence of an activating signal .
Looked at another way , if the half-life of IxBa-bound c-rel and p65 is ~8 h , IxBa is produced at at least 8 times the rate of their synthesis .
What is the advantage to the cell of such a seemingly wasteful system ?
One possibility is that it generates the low level of NF-xB activity that is presumably necessary even in unstimulated cells .
At a minimum , dividing cells must double their NF-xB content once per cycle , and active NF-xB is probably necessary to accomplish this [ the genes for both p105 and c-rel have xB sites in their promoter regions ( Hannink and Temin , 1990 ; Capobianco and Gilmore , 1991 ; Ten et al. , 1992 ; T.Kochel and N.R.Rice , unpublished ) ] .
The continual turnover of IxBa may provide the opportunity for small amounts of liberated c-rel/p65/p50 to enter the nucleus .
In contrast , if the complexes were very stable in the absence of an activation signal , there would be no active NF-xB for 'house-keeping ' purposes .
A second possible advantage of the system follows from the high rate of IxBa synthesis , which may provide the ability to curtail NF-xB activity rapidly once the activating signal subsides .
It has been suggested that IxBa is not only the major cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-xB , but that it is also responsible for turning off active NF-xB in the nucleus ( Zabel et al. , 1993 ) .
The hypothesis is that some excess IxBa molecules may enter the nucleus , bind to active NF-xB and release it from DNA .
However , there can only be excess IxBa if its rate of synthesis exceeds that of the c-re/ and p65 to which it binds .
If their rates of synthesis were the same , all new IxBa would bind to new c-rel/p65 : there would never be uncomplexed inhibitor , even in the presence of an activating agent .
In fact , the rate of synthesis of IxBa considerably exceeds that of the c-rel/p65 to which it binds .
We showed that under 'resting ' conditions enough IxBa is made not only to bind new c-rel/p65 , but also to replace old IxBa in pre-existing dimers .
Under activating conditions , however , some or many of those pre-existing dimers will have left the cytoplasm for the nucleus , thus creating an imbalance between the amount of newly synthesized IxBa and its available targets .
If some of the excess IxBa escapes degradation and enters the nucleus , it could inactivate some of the translocated dimers .
Such a system ensures that maintenance of NF-xB activity depends on continued migration of liberated dimers from cytoplasm to nucleus , i.e .
on the continued presence of the activating signal .
If the stimulus abates and no new dimers reach the nucleus , the nuclear IxBa can turn off the response very quickly .
Thus , even before the increased transcription of the IxBa gene that is induced by activating agents ( Haskill er al .
, 1991 ; Tewari et al. , 1992 ; Brown et al. , 1993 ; Sun et al. , 1993 ) , the 4693 N.R.Rice and M.K.Ernst system is very responsive to changes in the environment .
The important point is that it requires that IxBa and its target p65 and c-rel molecules be synthesized at different rates .
Thus , viewing this regulatory sytem as a whole , storage of active transcription factor in the cytoplasm enables instantaneous gene activation in response to cell stimulation .
Constitutive synthesis of excess inhibitor enables instantaneous damping of activity upon cessation or diminution of stimulation .
Materials and methods Cells and reagents Mouse cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , and , in the case of 702/3 , 50 4M 2-mercaptoethanol .

immunoblotting Cell pellets were washed in PBS , then in hypotonic buffer ( HB ) ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7.4 , 1 mM magnesium chloride , 5 mM potassium chloride ) and then incubated in HB for 15 min on ice .
An equal volume of HB containing 1 % NP-40 was added , and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min .

The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 gl buffer B ( 25 mM HEPES , pH 7.6 , 1 M KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) with frequent vortexing for 15 min at 4°C .
After centrifuging at 20 000 g for 20 min , the supernatant was diluted with buffer C ( 25 mM HEPES , pH 7.6 , 20 % glycerol , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) at a ratio of 1 part supernatant to 3.75 parts buffer C. This mixture constitutes the nuclear extract .
Oligonucleotides for EMSA Oligonucleotides were synthesized by an Applied Biosystems synthesizer and were used without purification .
