Cherla and Ramesh K. Ganju* Stromal cell-derived factor 1 « ( SDF1a ) and its cognate chemokine receptor CXCR4 act as potent chemoattractants and regulate trafficking and homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells and lymphocytes .
However , the molecular mechanisms regulating SDF1a-driven cell migration are not well defined .
In this study , we have explored the roles of the second messenger NO and the transcription factor NF-KB in SDF1la & -induced T cell migration .
SDF1la treatment of Jurkat T cells increased the activity of NO synthase , which catalyzes the generation of NO .
We observed that pretreatment of Jurkat cells or activated PBLs with several NO donors significantly enhanced the SDF1a & -induced migration , whereas various inhibitors of NO synthase markedly abrogated the chemotactic response in a concentration-dependent manner .
Furthermore , we observed that inhibitors of the transcription factor NF-B , which is linked to NO signaling pathways , also significantly blocked the SDF1a & -induced chemotactic response .
However , these compounds did not have a significant effect on SDF1la & -induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activity .
In addition , the MAP/Erk kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 did not abrogate SDF1a & -induced chemotaxis .
AKT , which has been shown to mediate NO production , was also phosphorylated upon SDF1 « stimulation .
These studies suggest that NO-related signaling pathways may mediate SDF1a & -induced chemotaxis , but not mitogen-activated protein kinase activation .
- The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 166 : 3067-3074. hemokines , which are a group of low molecular weight proteins , mediate several cellular functions .
They play an important role in the regulation of hematopoiesis , leukocyte maturation , angiogenesis , trafficking , and homing of T and B lymphocytes and in the development of lymphoid tissue ( 1-6 ) .
Based on the arrangement of their first two of four-conserved cysteine residues , the chemokine superfamily has been divided into four subfamilies : « ( C-X-C ) , B ( C-C ) , y ( C ) , and 8 ( C-X-X-X-C ) ( 1 , 2 , 6 .
Stromal cell-derived factor 1 « ( SDFia ) is a member of the CXC or e « -chemokine subfamily and is the only known ligand for the chemokine receptor CXCR4 ( 7-10 ) .
SDFla and CXCR4 are constitutively expressed in a large number of tissues ( 10-14 ) .
CXCR4 plays an important role in HIV infection and pathogenesis ( 9 , 10 , 15 ) .
SDF1a and the CXCR4 receptor also regulate embryonic development ( 16-19 ) .
Furthermore , knockout mice lacking CXCR4 or SDF1la protein are embryologically lethal .

SDFla has been shown to act as a potent chemoattractant for PBLs , monocytes , pre- and pro-B cells , and CD34 * human progenitors ( 6 , 11 , 20-22 ) .
However , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate these functions .
We and others have recently shown that CXCR4 can mediate signaling through various components of the focal adhesion complex such as the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase ( RAFTK ) , also known as Pyk2 or CAK-B ( 23-25 ) .
Furthermore , we also showed that mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase and NF- « B are activated upon SDFla stimulation ( 23 ) .
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , which has been shown to regulate chemotaxis ( 26 ) , is also involved in SDFla-induced and CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis and T cell migration ( 23 , 27 ) .
In our present study , we further delineate the signaling pathways that regulate CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis .
We have observed that NO and NF-B are key components of the SDF1 & -induced signaling cascade .
NO is a multifunctional signaling molecule that has been shown to regulate various cellular functions such as hemostasis , apopto-sis , inflammation , vascular tone , and chemotaxis ( 28-32 ) .
NO is produced from L-arginine by at least three isoforms of the NO synthase ( NOS ) enzyme : type I ( neuronal NOS ) , type II ( inducible NOS ) , and type III ( endothelial NOS ( eNOS ) ) ( 28-30 ) .
All three isoforms have been shown to be expressed at very low levels in different types of T cells ( 33-36 ) .
The activity of NOS can be regulated by its phosphorylation and by other posttranslational modifications .
It has been shown that AKT/protein kinase B can phosphorylate eNOS on serine 1179 , which leads to enzyme activation and NO production ( 37-39 ) .
NO modulates the functions of various proteins by nitrosylation and other posttranslational changes ( 40 ) .
NE- « B is a major transcription factor that regulates transcription of genes encoding many inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules ( 41 ) .
NF- « B has been shown to influence NO production by regulating expression of the inducible NO synthase gene 0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 3068 ( 42 ) .
Conversely , NO has also been shown to be capable of modulating NF-KB function in mononuclear leukocytes and endothelial cells ( 43 , 44 ) .
Although NO can regulate migration in several cell types ( 45-48 ) , its role in chemokine-mediated chemotaxis in T cells is not known .
We now report that SDF1a & treatment activates NOS in Jurkat T cells .
Furthermore , NO donors enhance SDF1 « -induced chemotaxis , whereas NO inhibitors potently abrogate this chemotaxis .
SDFla stimulation also induces AKT phosphorylation .
These studies provide new information regarding signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of chemokine-induced chemotaxis in T cells .

Protein amounts were determined by a protein assay ( Bio-Rad ) to normalize the concentrations in all of the samples .
Isolation of PBLs PBLs were isolated as described previously ( 49 ) .
Briefly , PBLs were isolated from heparinized venous blood collected from healthy donors by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 25 min .
The cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS , 2 mM glutamine , 50 pg/ml penicillin , and 50 ug/ml streptomycin .

The mean densities of the bands are represented as the OD in units per square millimeter .
Chemotaxis assays Assays were done as previously described ( 23 ) .
Briefly , Jurkat cells were washed twice and 10 X 10° cells/ml were suspended in medium containing RPMI 1640 with 2.5 % FCS .
The chemotaxis assay was performed in 24-well plates containing 5-um porosity inserts ( Costar , Kennebunk , ME ) .
Before performing the chemotaxis assays , the cells were treated with different concentrations of NO donors , NOS inhibitors , NF-KB inhibitor , or the appropriate controls for 30-60 min .
One hundred microliters ( 1 X 10° cells ) from each sample were loaded onto the upper well .
A total of 0.6 ml of medium containing SDF1 « ( 50 ng/m ! )
was added to the lower chamber .
The plates were incubated for 1.5-3 h at 37°C in 5 % CO ; .
After incubation , the porosity inserts were removed carefully and the viable cells were counted using standard procedures .
The results are expressed as the number of cells migrated to the bottom chamber .
Each experiment was performed three or four times in triplicate .

Results SDF la enhances NOS activity To elucidate the effect of SDF1a on NO production , Jurkat T cells , which were uniformly positive for the CXCR4 receptor as detected by 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology FACS analysis ( data not shown ) , were stimulated with SDF1 « for up to 6 h. NOS activity , which catalyzes the synthesis of NO , was assessed by measuring the conversion of to [ *HJcitrul-line .
As shown in Fig .
1 , SDF1a treatment resulted in an increase in total NOS activity .
Maximum activity was obtained around the 3-h time period .
NO donors enhance SDF la-mediated chemotaxis To explore the role of NO in SDF1 & -induced chemotaxis , Jurkat T cells were pretreated with the different NO donors SNAP , SNP , and PFC in a concentration-dependent manner and then a chemotaxis assay was performed as described in Materials and Methods .
As shown in Fig .
2 , NO donors significantly enhanced chemotaxis in a concentration-dependent manner .
There was about a 60 % increase in migration with SNAP at 1000 nM ( Fig .
24 ) , a 75 % increase with SNP at 0.1 M ( Fig .
2B ) , and a 70 % increase with PFC at 0.1 uM ( Fig .
2C ) as compared with the solvent controls .
SNP and PFC at very high concentrations had no or a lesser effect .
The effect of various donors on the viability of cells was determined .
No effect on cell viability using various compounds was observed under these conditions ( data not shown ) .
NO inhibitors attenuate SDF la & -induced chemotaxis The role of NO in SDF1 « -induced chemotaxis was further confirmed by using various inhibitors .
As shown in Fig .
3 , pretreatment of Jurkat cells with the NOS inhibitors L-NMMA and L-NAME , and TLCK which has been shown to inhibit NOS gene expression ( 51-53 ) , attenuated SDF1a & -induced chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner .
L-NMMA pretreatment resulted in a 60-70 % inhibition at 0.1-1.0 mM ( Fig .
34 ) , whereas L-NAME at 2 mM inhibited by 40 % the chemotactic response induced by SDF1la ( Fig .
3B ) .
Maximum inhibition ( 90 % ) was achieved with TLCK , at 100 uM ( Fig .
3C ) .
These NO donor and inhibitor studies revealed that NO is an important mediator of chemotactic responses induced by the « chemokine SDFla in T cells .
We also determined the effect of various inhibitors on cell viability to rule out the possibility that the observed decrease in chemotaxis was due to the decrease in cell viability .
No effect on cell viability using various inhibitors was observed under these conditions ( data not shown ) .
NF-KB inhibitors inhibit SDF la-induced chemotaxis We have recently shown that SDF1a activates NF- « B ( 23 ) .
Furthermore , NOS expression has been shown to be regulated by NF-kB .

Activation of NOS upon SDF1 @ stimulation of Jurkat cells .
Cell lysates were obtained from untreated cells or cells stimulated with SDF1a ( 100 ng/m ! )
for the indicated times .
The samples were assayed for NOS activity by measuring the release of [ °H ] } L-citrulline as described in Materials and Methods .
The activity of the unstimulated samples was subtracted from the total activity obtained from the SDF1 « -induced samples .
The results presented in the graph are representative of three experiments .
3069 determine the role of NF- « B in SDF1 « -induced chemotaxis , we used the NF-KB chemical inhibitor TPCK and the peptide inhibitor SN50 .
These inhibitors markedly attenuated SDF 1 -induced chemotactic effects in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig .
4 ) .
About 80 % inhibition was achieved with 100 M TPCK as compared with the methanol control ( Fig .
44 ) .
Similarly , 90 % inhibition was obtained with the SN50 peptide ( 100 pg/ml ) .
A mutant peptide , SNOM , which does not affect NF- « B activity under similar conditions , had no significant effects on SDF1 -induced chemotaxis ( Fig .
4B ) .
SN50 is a cell permeable peptide inhibitor containing the nuclear localization sequence of the NF- « B component p50 , which inhibits translocation of NF-KB into the nucleus .
SN5OM is an inactive control peptide with substitutions of two amino acids in the nuclear localization sequence region ( 54 ) .
These results suggest that NF- « B may regulate SDFla & -induced chemotaxis .

MAP kinase inhibitor has no effect on SDF 1a-induced chemotaxis In previous studies , we have shown that besides chemotactic activity , SDFla also induced MAP kinase activity in CXCR4-expressing pre-B cells ( 23 ) .
In this study , we further assessed the functional role of the MAP kinase pathway in SDF1l -induced chemotaxis .
Jurkat cells were pretreated either with PD98059 , which inhibits MEK kinase upstream of p44/42 MAP kinase , or with control solvent DMSO .
Cell migration in response to SDF1 « & was then determined .
As shown in Fig .
5 , PD98059 at various concentrations did not inhibit SDFl & -induced migration .
These studies suggest that the MAP kinase signaling pathway is not involved in the chemotaxis induced by SDFl a in T cells .
Effect of various compounds on the SDF 1a-induced chemotaxis of activated PBL s We also confirmed the effect of various compounds on the SDFla & -induced chemotaxis of activated PBLs .

The NF- « B chemical inhibitor TPCK ( 4 ) or peptide inhibitor SN5O ( B ) was incubated with cells for 30-60 min .
An appropriate solvent was used as the control for TPCK and SN5OM ( a mutated peptide ) was used as the control for SN50 .
Cells were subjected to chemotactic assay for 3 h in the presence of SDF1a ( 50 ng/m ! )
as described in Materials and Methods .

64 , an ~20-25 % increase in chemotaxis was observed with the NO donor SNP at 50-100 nM concentrations .
However , NO and various other inhibitors significantly blocked SDF1a-induced chemotaxis ( Fig .
6 , B-D ) .
TLCK inhibited chemotaxis by 90-95 % at a 10 M concentration ( Fig .
6B ) .
Similarly , the NF-B inhibitor TPCK ( 10 uM ; Fig .
6C ) or SN50 ( 100 ug/ml ; Fig .
619 ) inhibited ~90-95 % of the PBL chemotaxis induced by SDF1l « as compared with the control-treated samples .
However , the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059 ( Fig .
6E ) did not have any effect on SDF1a-induced chemotaxis at a 10 or 50 wM concentration .
These studies further confirmed that NO-linked signaling pathways participate in SDFla-induced chemotaxis .
We also determined the effect of the above-mentioned compounds on the viability of PBLs .
No effect on cell viability was observed under these conditions ( data not shown ) .
SDF Ia induces AKT phosphorylation AKT has been shown to phosphorylate eNOS and mediate NO production during vascular endothelial growth factor signaling ( 37-39 ) .
As shown in Fig .
7 , stimulation with SDF1 « increased the phosphorylation of AKT in Jurkat cells ( Fig .

Maximum phosphorylation was observed around 5-10 min of stimulation .
Equal amounts of AKT protein were present in each lane ( Fig .

These results suggest that AKT may regulate SDF1a-induced NO production and chemotaxis .

Discussion The a chemokine SDF1a and its cognate receptor CXCR4 have recently sparked substantial interest because of their role in embryonic development , immune regulation , and HIV pathogenesis ( 9 , 10 , 16-19 ) .
These molecules regulate chemotaxis and cell viability , which are important for various cellular functions such as wound repair , metas-tasis , inflammation , angiogenesis , and development of lymphoid tissue ( 55-57 ) .
We and others have recently studied signaling molecules activated by SDF1a ( 23-25 ) .
These studies have shown activation of PI3 kinase and focal adhesion components such as RAFTK/Pyk2 , paxillin , and Crk in SDF1 -induced signaling and in chemotaxis responses of pre-B and T cells ( 23-25 , 27 ) .
SDF1la was also shown to activate the JAK/STAT pathway ( 58 ) .
Since the coordinated regulation of several signaling components is required for mediating migration , we have further explored the signaling mechanisms regulating SDF1a-induced chemotaxis .
NO , generated by NOS , is known to be both an intercellular and intracellular signaling messenger involved in multiple cellular functions .
Pretreatment of Jurkat cells or PBLs with NO donors markedly enhanced SDF1 « -induced chemotaxis , whereas NO inhibitors significantly abrogated this cell migration .
However , NO donors SNP and PFC at higher concentrations had no or a lesser effect , respectively , on this migration .
This could be due to feedback inhibition of NOS , since various NO donors have been shown to attenuate NOS activity in a concentration-dependent manner ( 59 , 60 ) .
These results demonstrated that NO-linked signaling pathways mediate SDF1 -induced chemotaxis .
NO has been shown to have opposing and complex effects on chemotactic responses exerted by various stimuli .
For example , it has 3071 A .

Effect of various compounds on SDF1la-induced chemotaxis in PBLs .
Activated PBLs were pretreated with various compounds such as SNP ( 4 ) , TLCK ( B ) , TPCK ( C ) , SN5O0 ( D ) , or PD98059 ( ® ) .
Cells pretreated for 30-60 min with the appropriate solvents or peptide ( SN5OM ) were used as controls .
The cells were subjected to chemotaxis in the presence of SDF1 « ( 50 ng/ml ) for 1.5-3 h. * , Results that are significantly different from the control : A , p < 0.01 and B-D , p < 0.005. been shown that NO enhances chemotactic responses in some cell types ( 45 , 46 , 61-63 ) upon certain stimuli , while inhibiting cell migration in others ( 47 , 64 ) .
Furthermore , NO has been shown to modulate T cell chemotaxis in Peyer 's patches and in the nonlymphoid region of the intestine ( 65 ) .
NO can exert its effects on cell motility through the modulation of cytoskeletal proteins and via cell matrix interactions ( 66 , 67 ) .
The cytoskeletal proteins paxillin , Crk , and RAFTK/Pyk2 are activated upon SDF1a stimulation ( 23-25 ) .
NO also induces the tyrosine nitration of the cytoskeletal protein p130cas , which is phosphorylated by SDF1a ( 68 ) .
We have recently shown that SDF1a induced NF- « B activation in CXCR4 transfectants ( 23 ) .
In this study , we have demonstrated that NF- « B inhibitors abrogate SDF1 & -induced chemotactic effects .
NO-related compounds have been shown to activate NF- « B activity ( 42 ) .
Moreover , the transcriptional activity of NF- « B has been shown to regulate iNOS gene expression ( 68 , 69 ) .
Furthermore , NF- « B has been shown to play an important role in cell migration when using various inhibitors that block NF-KB activation ( 70-72 ) .
PI3 kinase has been shown to regulate SDF1a-induced migration , which in turn has been shown to activate AKT ( protein kinase B ) .
In the present study , we have shown that SDF1 a enhances AKT phosphorylation .
Activated AKT has recently been shown to phosphorylate eNOS and enhance its activity , leading to NO production ( 37-39 ) .

SDFla induces phosphorylation of AKT in Jurkat cells and PBLs .
Cell lysates ( 50 ug ) obtained from Jurkat cells ( 4 ) or PBLs ( B ) , unstimulated ( 0 ) or stimulated for varying time periods with 100 ng/ml SDF1 « , were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-AKT Ab ( upper panels ) .
The blots were stripped and reblotted with AKT Ab ( bottom panels ) .
In addition , AKT was demonstrated to mediate NF-KB activation ( 73 , 74 ) induced by TNF and platelet-derived growth factor .
AKT was also shown to associate with IxB kinase and to phosphorylate IB kinase at threonine 23. motactic response , but has no significant effect on MAP kinase stimulation in CXCR4-mediated signaling pathways .
Furthermore , we observed that MAP kinase does not regulate NOS activity as PD98059 ( a specific inhibitor of p44/42 MAP kinase ) at a 50 M concentration had no effect on NOS activity induced by SDF1a ( data not shown ) .
However , NO has been shown to have complex and opposing effects on the MAP kinase activation induced by various stimuli .
For example , it has been shown that NO has partial or no effect on MAP kinase activation under certain conditions ( 77-78 ) , whereas it mediates this activation in several other cell types ( 79-81 ) .
In addition , PD98059 has been shown to inhibit the expression of NOS ( 82 , 83 ) .
Taken together , our results suggest that NO and NF- « B may mediate SDF1 « -induced chemotactic activity , but not MAP kinase activation in T cells .
These findings provide new information at the molecular level on the signal transduction pathways used by the a chemokine SDF1a and its receptor CXCR4 to regulate T cell migration , an important event in both physiological and pathological processes .
