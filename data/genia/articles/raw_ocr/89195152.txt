49 , 22145-22165 , April 15 , 1989 ] Properties of Glucocorticoid Receptors in Epstein-Barr Virus-transformed Lymphocytes from Patients with Familial Cortisol Resistance ' Sayomi lida , '' Masahiro Gomi , Kaname Moriwaki , Hiroshi Fujii , Mamiko Tsugawa , and Seiichiro Tarui Second Department of Internal Medicine , Osaka University Medical School , Fukushima , 1-1-50 Fukushima , Osaka 553 , Japan Abstract In a previous report of two patients with familial glucocorticoid resistance due to reduced numbers of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) , we have shown decreased numbers of GR in peripheral mononuclear cells and cultured fibroblasts but normal affinity of GR in both patients .
In this study , peripheral lymphocytes from these patients , one patient 's son and daughter , and normal subjects were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus .
Reduced numbers and normal affinity of GR were found in the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from both patients while the son and daughter had normal numbers and affinity of GR .
The thermal stability of GR and thermal activation of cytosolic receptors in both patients were found to be normal .
Aithough the percentages of nuclear bound GR were similar in both patients and normal controls , the absolute amounts of nuclear bound GR of the patients were about one-half that of normal controls .
These abnormal properties of GR ( reduced numbers of GR ) were preserved in the transformed cells from the patients .
Introduction We have previously reported two patients in the same family with primary cortisol resistance accompanied by a decrease in numbers of GR in peripheral mononuclear cells ( 1 ) .
These patients , patient I ( 35-year-old male ) and patient II ( mother ) , had sustained hypercortisolemia , but they presented no manifestation of Cushing 's syndrome .
Although there was a slight elevation of plasma deoxycorticosterone levels in patient I and corticosterone in patient II , both patients exhibited mild hypertension without hypokalemia .
Both patients were partially resistant to Dex adrenal suppression .
Reduced numbers but normal affinity of GR were found in the peripheral mononuclear cells from both patients and in the cultured skin fibroblasts from patient I ( 2 ) .
Tritiated thymidine uptake in the cultured fibroblasts from patient I was not inhibited to the extent observed with fibroblasts from normal individuals , indicating a resistance of the patient 's cells to Dex ( 3 ) .
The aim of this study was to examine the properties of GR after transformation by EBV in lymphocytes obtained from the patients and other family members .
Materials and Methods [ PH ] Dexamethasone ( 49 Ci/mmol ) was purchased from New England Nuclear ( Boston , MA ) ; Dex , dithiothreitol , and EDTA from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO ) ; DNA-cellulose was from Bio-Rad ( Richmond , CA ) ; and FCS was from Flow Laboratories , Inc. ( Sydney , Australia ) .
Transformation of Lymphocytes with EBV .
Sterile heparinized blood ( 20 ml ) was collected from the patients , patient I 's son and daughter , and ten normal subjects and diluted 2-fold with saline .
The mononuclear cell fraction was separated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation .
The mononuclear cell suspensions ( 5 X 10° cells/ml ) were mixed with 1 volume of 10 % sheep RBC suspensions in saline ' Presented at the Symposium on `` Glucocorticoid Receptors : Evolution , Struc-ture , Function and Abnormalities , '' July 14 and 15 , 1988 , Osaka , Japan .

treated with neuraminidase and 1 volume of FCS and then incubated on ice for 2 h. After Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation , the B-lymphocytes were separated from the T-lymphocytes which formed rosettes .
The B-lymphocytes were washed twice with PBS , pH 7.4 , and suspended at a density of 5 x 10° cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 % FCS .
Aliquots ( 0.1 ml ) of B-lymphocyte suspensions were mixed with 0.1 ml of medium containing EBV derived from B95-8 cells ( 2.5-5.0 x 10° cells/ml ) in 24-well plastic culture plates .
After incubation at 37°C for 1 h in an atmosphere of 5 % CO ; -95 % humid air , 0.8 ml RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 % FCS was added to each well .
Four days later , the same volume of fresh medium was added .
After 2 to 3 weeks , the transformed cells began to proliferate and were then transferred to 100-mm tissue culture plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS .
GR Assay in Whole Cell .
Whole cell binding studies were performed as previously described ( 1 ) .
Transformed cells were cultured in serum free RPMI 1640 for 24 h prior to assay and were judged 90 % viable by trypan blue exclusion assay .
Aliquots of these cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 with seven concentrations of [ } H ] Dex ( 0.31-20 nm ) for 6 h at 24°C in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Dex .
After incubation , the cells were washed with 3 ml ice-cold PBS three times to remove free steroid and centrifuged at 400 x g for 10 min .
After the final wash , the pellets were counted for radioactivity .
Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding and these data were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard ( 4 ) .
Nuclear Binding of PHJDex .
Transformed lymphocytes were incubated with four concentrations of [ ' H ] Dex ( 0.31-2.5 nM ) in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Dex at 37°C for 30 min .
After incubation , the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS .
One-fifth were used to determine whole cell binding and the remainder to determine nuclear binding .
To obtain the nuclear fraction , cell pellets were suspended in 3 ml ice-cold hypotonic buffer ( pH 8.0 ) containing 20 mM N-tris ( hydroxymethyl ) methylglycine , 2 mm CaCl , and 1 mm MgCl ; and immediately frozen in ethanol-dry ice ( 5 ) .
After room temperature thawing , the lysed cells were centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min at 4°C .
The nuclear pellets were washed twice with hypotonic buffer and counted for the radioactivity .
The DNA content was measured by a fluorometric method reported by Labarca and Paigen ( 6 ) .
Preparation of Low-Speed Cytosol .
Transformed lymphocytes were washed three times with room temperature PBS .
Pellets were resus-pended in ice-cold ETG buffer in an all-glass Dounce homogenizer using 20 manual strokes .
These homogenates were centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 10 min .
The supernatants represented the low-speed cytosol ( 2 mg protein/ml cytosol ) ( 7 ) .
Protein content was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay .
DNA-Cellulose Chromatography .
The low-speed cytosol was incubated with 50 nm [ °H ] Dex at 0°C for 4 h in the presence or absence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Dex .
Dextran-coated charcoal [ final concentration , charcoal 1 % ( w/v ) , dextran 0.1 % ( w/v ) ] was added to the cytosol and centrifuged to remove unbound steroid .
Activation was accomplished by incubating the cytosol at 25°C for 30 min , followed by an ice bath , and loaded onto a 1-ml 4°C DNA-cellulose column that had been equilibrated with ETG buffer .
After 15 min incubation , the column was washed with six column volumes of ETG buffer ( 8 ) .
The sample was eluted with ETG buffer containing stepwise addition of KCI ( 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.25 , and 0.30 M ) .
Fractions ( 0.5 ml ) were collected and their radioactivity was determined .
Thermostability of GR .
Transformed lymphocytes were washed twice with room temperature PBS and preincubated in RPMI 1640 at 30°C , 37°C , and 42°C for 60 min ; then 50 nm [ °H ] Dex in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess unlabeled Dex was added for 60 min .
After this incubation at the indicated temperatures , cells were washed three 2214s Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

Thermostability of GR .
Fig .
4 shows the specific binding capacity of GR in transformed lymphocytes at various incubation temperatures ( 30°C , 37°C , and 42°C ) .
The binding capacity of GR in cells from normal subjects was decreased with elevated temperature .
At any temperature , the binding capacity of GR in cells from both patients was about one-half those of normal subjects .
Discussion The binding capacity of GR in EBV-transformed lymphocytes from normal subjects was increased 7-fold over that of peripheral mononuclear cells .
On the other hand , the binding affinity of GR in transformed lymphocytes from normal subjects remained the same as that of peripheral mononuclear cells .
These results correspond to those of Tomita et al .
( 9 ) who reported that viral transformation of peripheral lymphocytes was associated with increased numbers of GR whereas other qualitative characteristics of the receptor remained similar .
The binding capacity of GR in transformed cells of patients I and II was also increased 6- to 7-fold that of peripheral mononuclear cells , while the binding affinity of GR was the same as that of peripheral mononuclear cells .
Therefore , the number of GR in these patients ' cells was decreased to about one-half of those from normal subjects .
The affinity of GR in cells from both patients was normal .
These results correspond to data obtained in peripheral mononuclear cells .
In the son and daughter of patient I , the binding capacity and the affinity of GR were both normal .
Godlowski and Michaels ( 10 ) demonstrated that both the binding capacity and affinity of GR were altered at the cell cycles using synchronized HeLa cell cultures .
It has also been reported by Crabtree et al .
( 11 ) that a 2- to 3-fold increase of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell in cells in S and post-S phase was observed compared to those in cells in G , and G ; phase using both nonstimulated rat lymph node cell suspensions and concanavalin A-stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes .
Therefore , in the present study , transformed lymphocytes were preincubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 to synchronize cell cycles to the G phase for 24 h prior to the binding assay .
Tomita et al .
( 12 ) reported reduced numbers and affinity of GR in transformed lymphocytes from their patients with familial cortisol resistance , whose GR abnormalities included reduced GR affinity ( 13 ) .
They speculated that induction of the expression of GR by EBV transformation was also impaired in patients ' cells .
In the present study , the numbers of GR in transformed cells of both patients were reduced to one-half of those in transformed cells of normal subjects .
Thus , induction of the expression of GR in the patients ' lymphocytes by transformation appeared to take place to the same degree as in transformed cells of normal subjects .
The percentages of GR- [ °H ] Dex complexes bound to nuclei in both patients were the same as normal ones .
These results suggest that the transfer of GR- [ } H ] Dex complexes to nuclei in both patients was normal .
Since the elution pattern in DNA-cellulose chromatography of GR- [ °H } Dex complexes in both patients was similar to those in normal subjects , the affinity of GR in both patients ' cells to DNA was normal .
The ratio of GR- [ ' H ] Dex complexes retained to the DNA column against the retained plus flowthrough in both patients was also normal .
Therefore , heat activation of GR complexes in both patients appears to be accomplished normally .
Although elevated temperature caused decreases in [ °H ] Dex binding to cells in both normal subjects and patients , at each incubation temperature , [ PH ] Dex binding to cells in patients was reduced to about one-half that in normal ones .
Therefore , thermolability of GR in both patients was demonstrated to be normal .
Decreased numbers with normal affinity of GR in transformed lymphocytes from our patients with familial cortisol resistance were demonstrated as shown in peripheral mononuclear cells .
No abnormalities of the patients ' GR in nuclear binding , DNA binding , and thermolability were found .
Since the abnormal properties of GR in these patients also remained in transformed lymphocytes , these cells appear to be a useful source for analyzing gene abnormalities .
