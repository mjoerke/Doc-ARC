In humans , there are two highly homologous genes encoding SCM-la & and SCM-1§ .
Here we examined the regulatory mechanism of the SCM-1 genes .
The luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 5 ' flanking region of 0.7 kb was strongly induced upon activation with anti-CD3 or PHA plus PMA only in SCM-1-producer T cell lines through a cyclosporin A-sensitive mechanism .
An element termed E1 located at -108 to -95 nt relative to the major transcription start site was found to be critical for the promoter activity .
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the E1 oligonucleotide as probe , nuclear extracts from unstimulated T and B cell lines formed a constitutive complex termed complex I , while nuclear extracts from stimulated SCM-1-producer T cell lines formed a higher mobility complex termed complex II with a concomitant decrease in complex I .
The shift from complex I to complex II seen only in SCM-1-producer T cell lines upon activation was completely suppressed by cyclosporin A .
Both complexes were critically dependent on the NF-AT core sequence TTTCC in the E1 element and were partially supershifted by anti-NF-ATp .
One-hybrid assays in yeast isolated NF-ATp as an E1 binding protein , and transfection of NF-ATp into T and B cell lines strongly enhanced the activation-dependent SCM-1 promoter activity .
Collectively , a unique mechanism involving NF-ATp appears to regulate the cell type-specific and activation-dependent expression of the SCM-1 genes .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 163 : 3295-3303. ingle C motif-1 ( SCM-1 ) */lymphotactin/activation-in- duced , T cell-derived , and chemokine-related molecule ( ATAC ) is a novel cytokine produced by activated T cells ( 1-4 ) .
It has a significant structural homology to chemokines , especially to the CC subfamily , but lacks the first and third of the four canonical cysteine residues conserved in other chemokines .
It is thus considered to represent the C subfamily of chemokine .
The pathophysiologic functions of SCM-1 are still mostly unknown .
It was reported to be chemotactic for lymphocytes and NK cells ( 1 , 4-6 ) .
It was found to be selectively expressed by activated CD8 * T cells and double-negative « B-type thymocytes ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) .
Furthermore , epidermal dendritic y8-type T cells and intestinal intraepithelial y8-type T cells were found to produce copious amounts of this cytokine upon activation ( 7 ) .
IL-2-activated murine NK cells and human NK clones were also shown to express its mRNA ( 6 ) .

Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists Thus , SCM-1/lymphotactin/ATAC is a unique cytokine whose expression is highly selective for certain subsets of T cells and NK cells .
In our previous study we isolated genomic clones hybridizing with the SCM-1 cDNA .
There are two highly homologous SCM-1 genes , termed and SCYC2 , in the human genome ( 8 ) .
These two genes are closely mapped to human chromosome 19423 , similarly inducible in peripheral blood T cells and Jurkat T cell line upon activation , and encode SCM-1a « and SCM-1 $ with only two amino acid differences ( 8 ) .
We have also identified a specific functional receptor for SCM-1a and SCM-1 , now termed XCR1 , which is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor selectively expressed in tissues such as placenta , spleen , and thymus ( 9 ) .
In the present study we have investigated the molecular mechanism of SCM-1 gene expression in particular subsets of T cells .
Because cyclosporin A ( CsA ) was shown to suppress the induction of this protein in activated CD8 * T cells ( 3 ) , the NF-AT family transcription factors are likely to be involved in its expression ( 10 ) .
We have found that an NF-AT-like cis-acting element in the 5 ' flanking regions of the SCM-1 genes termed E1 is essential and sufficient for activation-dependent , cell type-specific , and CsA-sensitive gene expression .
We have further demonstrated that E1 is a site of constitutive and activation-inducible DNA-protein interactions involving NF-AT family proteins .
Materials and Methods Cells Human T cell lines , Jurkat , PEER , and HPB-ALL , and a human B cell line BALL-1 were described previously ( 11 ) .
These cell lines and HeLa-S3 were maintained in RPMI 1640 , 10 % heat-inactivated FCS , and kanamycin ( 30 ug/ml ) .

primary human T lymphocytes with preference for CD8 * T cells .
Expression of the reporter gene in the CD4 * T cell populations might be due in part to the relatively low purity of CD4 * T cells ( ~80 % ) and/or to human equivalents of the murine NK1.1~* CD4 '' T cells that were mentioned to express lymphotactin/ SCM-1 ( 4 ) .
In Fig .
2C , we further tested the cell type-specific promoter activity by using five human cell lines .
The CMV-B-gal plasmid was used to normalize transfection efficiency by B-gal activity .
Consistent with the induction of the endogenous SCM-1 genes ( 8 ) , the treatment with PHA and PMA strongly activated the promoter in Jurkat ( a CD4 single-positive T cell line ) and PEER ( a double-negative 78 T cell line ) , but not in HPB-ALL ( a double-positive T cell line ) , BALL-1 ( a B cell line ) , or HeLa ( an epithelial cell line ) ( 11 ) .
Thus , the ~0.7-kb 5 ' flanking sequence of the SCM-1 « gene is functional only in certain T cell lines that are capable of expressing the endogenous SCM-1 genes upon activation ( 8 ) .
We also tested the effect of CsA on the stimulation-dependent activation of the promoter in Jurkat .
As shown in Fig .
2D , CsA completely abrogated the activation of the promoter by PHA and PMA with an ICs , of about 1 ng/ml .
Collectively , these results clearly demonstrated that the ~0.7-kb 5 ' flanking regions of the SCM-1 genes contain major cis-acting elements that regulate the activation-dependent , cell type-specific , and CsA-sensitive expression of the SCM-1 genes .
Deletion analysis of the 5 ' flanking region To determine the cis-acting regulatory elements in the 5 ' flanking region of the SCM-1a « gene , we transfected a series of luciferase reporter plasmids with progressively deleted 5 ' flanking regions into Jurkat cells .
As shown in Fig .
3 , all the plasmids showed a very low level of basal promoter activity .
Upon PHA and PMA stimulation , -669/luec and -497/luc induced luciferase activity by about 30-fold ; -279/luc , -117/luec and -108/lue induced luciferase activity by about 15-fold ; -98/luc , -83/luc , and -62/luc induced luciferase activity by about 3-fold ; -42/lue and -32/luc induced luciferase activity by < 2-fold .
From these results , at least three regions ( -497 to -279 , -108 to -98 , and -62 to -42 ) appeared to contribute to the full inducibility of the SCM-1a promoter upon treatment with PHA and PMA , and the region between -108 and -98 contained a major cis-acting element .
A close inspection of the sequence in and around this region revealed a sequence ( -101 to -92 ) that contained an inverted core sequence of the NF-AT site ( TTTCC ) ( 10 ) .
Because NF-AT is known to be involved in the expression of various cytokine genes in T cells by activation-dependent and CsA-sensitive Luciferase P ?
Luciferase B _ stimulated [ ] - unstimulated I Luciferase 220 % svao [ Cacher /no mechanisms ( 10 ) , our subsequent study was focused on this element .
For the sake of convenience , we designated the sequence between -108 and -83 as element 1 ( E1 ; Fig .
1 ) .
Role of the NF-AT core sequence in El We first examined the effect of mutations in the NFE-AT core sequence of E1 on the promoter activity of the -669-bp 5 ' flanking region .
The luciferase reporter plasmids with the wild-type E1 or a mutated El with three base substitutions in the NF-AT core sequence ( Fig .
44 ) were transfected into Jurkat and PEER .
As shown in Fig .
4B , the mutations at this site effectively abrogated the stimulation-dependent induction of the reporter driven by the -669-bp 5 flanking region in both cell lines .
To further test whether E1 was an activation-inducible and CsA-sensitive regulatory element , we constructed an artificial reporter plasmid by inserting six tandem repeats of E1 in the upstream of the -42/luc ( Fig .
3 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4C , the reporter driven by the tandem repeats of E1 was indeed induced by about 10-fold in transfected Jurkat by PHA and PMA .
Furthermore , this induction was fully abrogated by CsA .
Taken together , E1 containing the NF-AT core sequence is a critical regulatory element for the activation-dependent and CsA-sensitive expression of the SCM-1 promoter .
Binding of nuclear proteins to El To demonstrate specific interactions of nuclear proteins with El , EMSA was conducted using the E1 probe ( Fig .
5A ) .
Unexpectedly , even the nuclear extract from unstimulated Jurkat was capable of forming a DNA-binding complex , termed complex I .
On the other hand , the nuclear extract from stimulated Jurkat formed a higher mobility complex , termed complex II , with concomitant decrease in complex I .
Both complexes were blocked by the wild-type El site probe ( wt ) , but not by a mutated E1 site probe with three base substitutions in the NF-AT core sequence ( mu , see Fig .
44 ) .
More-over , the mutated E1 site probe ( mu-E1 ) failed to form any complexes with the nuclear extracts from either unstimulated or stimulated Jurkat .
These results indicated that the NF-AT core sequence of the E1 site , which is critical for the enhancer activity of the E1 site ( Fig .
4 ) , is also critical for the formation of both complex I and complex II .
EMSA was also conducted to test the effect of CsA .
As shown in Fig .
5B , the nuclear extract of Jurkat cells stimulated with PHA and PMA in the presence of CsA only formed complex I and failed to form complex II .
Thus , the shift from complex I to complex II observed upon stimulation with PHA and PMA was effectively blocked by CsA treatment .

The luciferase assay was performed in triplicate .

shift from complex I to complex II was required for the transcriptional activation .
By cold competition experiments , we next analyzed the nature of the nuclear proteins binding to E1 in complex I and II .
As shown in Fig .
5C , both complexes were clearly inhibited by the E1 probe at 10-fold excess and by the IL-2 NF-AT site probe at 10- to 30-fold excess ( 15 ) .
On the other hand , the IL-2 AP-1 site probe ( 15 ) hardly affected complex I even at a 100-fold excess .
This probe , however , partially inhibited complex II at a 30- to 100-fold excess .
For an internal control , EMSA was also conducted using the IL-2 NF-AT site probe ( 15 ) .
As expected , a complex was formed only with the extract from stimulated Jurkat .
Furthermore , 3299 this complex was inhibited by the IL-2 NF-AT site probe ( and the E1 site probe ) as well as by the IL-2 AP-1 site probe ( 10 , 15 ) ( Fig .
5D ) .
Collectively , these results suggested that both complexes contained proteins related to NF-AT .
Furthermore , the complex II might contain a cofactor related to the AP-1 family .
However , there is no consensus AP-1 site as defined by T ( T/G ) ANT ( A/C ) A ( 18 ) in or around the E1 site ( Fig .
1 ) .
To further define the critical nucleotides in the E1 site that were involved in the formation of constitutive complex I and inducible complex II , we next conducted EMSA in the presence of mutated E1 site probes with scanning-type 2-bp substitutions as cold competitors .
As shown in Fig .
55 , both constitutive complex I and activation-inducible complex II showed essentially identical inhibition patterns , indicating that the same nucleotide sequence in the E1 site was involved in the formation of both complexes .
Furthermore , the lack of competition by M6 , M7 , and M8 revealed that TTTCCA corresponding exactly to the NF-AT core sequence was essential for the formation of both complexes ( 10 ) .
Cell type-specific formation of complex II By using the E1 probe , EMSA was further conducted with nuclear extracts from Jurkat , PEER , BALL-1 , and HPB-ALL ( Fig .
6 , upper panel ) .
Both Jurkat and another SCM-1 producer T cell line , PEER ( 8 ) , formed the constitutive complex I before activation and the inducible complex II with a concomitant decrease or disappearance of complex I upon activation with PHA and PMA .
SCM-1-nonproducer cell lines BALL-1 and HPB-ALL ( 8 ) also formed complex I , but failed to form complex II even after activation with PHA and PMA .
Thus , the formation of complex II was seen only with the nuclear extracts from SCM-1 producer cell lines upon stimulation with PHA and PMA ( Fig .
2 ) .
As internal controls , the same nuclear extracts were probed with the IL-2 NF-AT site probe ( 15 ) .
In this case , the DNA-binding complex was seen only with extracts from stimulated Jurkat and HPB-ALL ( Fig .
6 , lower panel ) .
NF-ATp as a component of complexes I and II To test the presence of the NF-AT family proteins in complexes I and II , the effect of polyclonal anti-NF-ATp was examined in EMSA .
As shown in Fig .
7A , complex I formed with the nuclear extract from unstimulated Jurkat was partially supershifted by anti-NF-ATp , while both complex I and complex II formed with the nuclear extract from activated Jurkat were reduced by anti-NF-ATp ( panel El ) .
A faint supershift band was also seen .
The discrepancy of the effect of anti-NF-ATp on complex I formed by unstimulated Jurkat and that formed by stimulated Jurkat was unexpected and might indicate that they were not identical .
As internal controls , the same Ab was shown to partially supershift the IL-2 NF-AT nuclear complex ( panel NFAT ) , but to have no effect on the SP-1 nuclear complex ( panel SP-1 ) .
We further examined the effects of various anti-NF-AT Abs in EMSA using the nuclear extracts from PEER .
As shown in Fig .
7B , anti-NF-ATp again partially supershifted complex I formed by the nuclear extract of unstimulated PEER .
It also slightly reduced and faintly supershifted the complex II formed by the nuclear extract from stimulated PEER even though the effect was less dramatic than that seen with Jurkat .
No such effects were seen with anti-NF-ATc and anti-NF-ATx .
Collectively , these results support that both complexes I and II contain NF-ATp or some proteins immunologically cross-reactive with anti-NF-ATp .
Binding of NF-ATp to El To identify proteins binding to El , we conducted one-hybrid screening in yeast ( 17 ) .

tandem repeats of E1 site linked to a low activity promoter directing His3 gene expression .
A Jurkat cDNA library of 2 X 10° clones expressing a translational fusion with the Gal4 frans-activating domain was transformed into a his yeast strain carrying the HIS3 reporter plasmid .
About 2 million transformants were plated on the medium lacking histidine , and 20 HIS* colonies were isolated .
By partial sequencing , we found that 10 of 20 positive clones were NF-ATp .
We sequenced one NF-ATp clone and found that it encoded an N-terminally truncated NF-ATp starting from the amino acid position at 401 and consisting of 521 aa fused in-frame to the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4 .
To measure its frans-activation activity , we conducted B-gal reporter assay in yeast using a reporter construct consisting of six tandem repeats of E1 site linked to a low activity promoter directing lacZ gene expression ( 17 ) .
As shown in Fig .
8 , the NF-ATp-Gal4 fusion protein was capable of inducing the reporter gene by about 20-fold .
Thus , NF-ATp is capable of directly binding to the E1 site in yeast .
Transfected NF-ATp enhances SCM-1 promoter activity To further examine the effect of NF-ATp on the SCM-1 promoter , we cotransfected -669/luc with wild-type E1 site ( wt ) or mutated E1 site ( u ; see Fig .
4 ) and either a control vector or a vector expressing an N-terminally truncated 464-aa functional NF-ATp ( 12 ) into Jurkat and BALL-1 .
As shown in Fig .
9 , transfection of functional NF-ATp into Jurkat significantly augmented the activity of the SCM-1 promoter with the wild-type E1 site , but not that with the mutated El site upon stimulation with PHA and PMA .
Furthermore , transfection of NF-AT ' p into the SCM-1-nonproducer BALL-1 strongly induced the activity of the wild-type promoter , but not that of the mutated one upon stimulation with PHA and PMA .
The latter observation may support the lack of expression of functional NF-ATp in BALL-1 ( 19 ) .
Thus , an N-terminally truncated functional NF-ATp ( 12 ) is capable of frans-activating the SCM-1 promoter through the E1 site upon cell activation .

EMSA was conducted using the indicated probes ( NF-AT , E1 , SP-1 ) labeled with °°P .
In supershifting experiments , nuclear extracts were pre-treated with nonimmune IgG , anti-.NF-ATp , anti-NF-ATe , or anti-NF-ATx before incubation with the *P-labeled E1 probe .
These Abs did not form complexes when incubated with the probe alone ( not shown ) .
Discussion Studies to examine factors that regulate the expression of cyto-kines such as IL-2 and IL-4 have demonstrated that the NF-AT family of transcription factors plays an essential role in the activation-inducible and CsA-sensitive gene expression ( 10 ) .

The control ( pLacZ ) and test construct ( pLacZ-El X 6 ) were integrated into the recipient yeast genomes .
The reporter yeast strains were then transformed with the control vector expressing only the Gal4 activation domain ( pGAD ) or the vector expressing the Gal4 activation domain fused to NF-ATp ( pGAD-NF-ATp ) , and B-gal activity was measured .
Experiments were performed in duplicate .

kDa ) , NF-AT2/NF-ATe ( ~80 kDa ) , NF-AT3 ( ~100 kDa ) , and NF-AT4/NF-ATx ( ~120 kDa ) ( 12 , 20-23 ) .
They share a highly homologous DNA-binding domain that shows a weak sequence similarity to the DNA-binding domain of the Rel family proteins ( 24 , 25 ) .
Activation of T cells leads to translocation of cytoplasmic NF-AT into the nucleus through dephosphorylation of NF-AT by Ca* * /calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin , which is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 ( 26 ) .
Within nuclei , translocated NFE-AT and a de novo synthesized cofactor cooperatively bind to a composite site ( 10 ) .
Thus , most NF-AT binding sites in various cytokine promoters are accompanied by the binding sites for auxiliary transcription factors such as AP-1 and Oct ( 10 ) .
For example , NF-AT and AP-1 cooperatively bind to multiple composite sites in the promoter of IL-2 for full induction in activated T cells ( 27 ) .
The distal NF-AT site in the IL-4 promoter also consists of a composite binding site for NF-AT and AP-1 ( 28 ) .
Recently , the proto-oncogene c-maf was found to REGULATION OF SCM-1/LYMPHOTACTIN BY NF-AT be expressed highly selectively in Th2-type T cells and to act in synergy with NF-AT to frans-activate the IL-4 promoter by binding adjacent to the proximal NF-AT site ( 29 ) .
Furthermore , a nuclear factor designated NIP45 has been shown to interact with the Rel homology domain of NF-ATp and to act in synergy with NFATp and c-Maf in the expression of IL-4 ( 30 ) .
Thus , it is likely that cell type-specific cofactors assembling at a given NF-AT site determine the cell type-specific expression of various cytokines .
SCM-1/lymphotactin/ATAC is a unique cytokine whose expression is highly selective for activated CD8 * T cells , double-negative thymocytes , intradermal y8* dendritic T cells , intestinal intraepithelial y8* T cells , and NK cells ( 1-8 ) .
Like IL-2 and IL-4 , which serve as models to examine differential transcriptional regulation between Th1 and Th2 ( 31 , 32 ) , SCM-1 may provide a unique model for activation-dependent gene expression in particular subsets of T cells and NK cells .
In the present study we have shown that the SCM-1 promoter has an element termed El between -108 and -90 relative to the transcription initiation site ( Fig .
1 ) .
E1 is essential and sufficient for the activation-dependent and CsA-sensitive expression of the SCM-1 genes ( Figs .
2-4 ) .
Importantly , the E1 site contains the NF-AT core sequence ( TTTCC ) ( 10 ) that is essential for its enhancer activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
Unlike most other NFE-AT sites ( 10 ) , however , the E1 site probe formed a constitutive complex , termed complex I , with nuclear extracts from unstimulated SCM-1 producer T cell lines and even from SCM-1 nonproducer cell lines ( Fig .
5 ) .
With nuclear extracts from stimulated SCM-1 producer T cell lines , however , the El probe formed a higher mobility complex , termed complex II , with a concomitant decrease in complex I ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
Furthermore , the shift from complex I to complex II upon cell activation was effectively suppressed by treatment with CsA ( Fig .
5 ) .
Both complexes were critically dependent on the NFE-AT core sequence ( Fig .
5 ) and were partially supershifted by anti-NF-ATp , but not by anti- NF-ATe or anti-NF-AT ' x ( Fig .
7 ) .
Furthermore , NF-ATp was found to be a protein capable of binding to the E1 site bait in the yeast one-hybrid assay ( Fig .
8 ) ( 17 ) .
Exogenously transfected N-terminally truncated functional NF-ATp ( 12 ) was further shown to be capable of trans-activating the SCM-1 promoter in the El-de-pendent manner upon stimulation with PHA and PMA ( Fig .
9 ) .
Collectively , these results support the following conclusions .
Transcription from the SCM-1 promoter takes place through a shift from the preexisting complex I to the activation-inducible complex IL The NF-AT core sequence ( TTTCC ) in E1 is critical for the formation of both complexes .
NF-ATp is capable of binding to the NF-AT core sequence of E1 .
NF-ATp appears to be associated with both complexes , but induces transcription of the SCM-1 promoter only upon stimulation with PHA and PMA .
The SCM-1 E1 site thus presents notable differences from the classical IL-2 NFE-AT sites ( 10 ) .
In the case of IL-2 NF-AT sites , NF-AT proteins bind only after stimulation-induced nuclear translocation ( 10 ) .
In the case of E1 , however , not only the inducible complex II but also the pre-existing complex I seem to contain NF-ATp or proteins immunologically reactive with anti-NF-ATp .
Second , the IL-2 AP-1 site competitor only weakly inhibited the activation-inducible complex II of E1 ( Fig .
5 ) .
This contrasts to the IL-2 NF-AT sites , because the IL-2 AP-1 site competitor effectively inhibits the complex between the IL-2 NF-AT probe and nuclear extracts from stimulated T cells ( 10 , 15 ) ( Fig .
5 ) .
In fact , no potential AP-1 site with a consensus sequence of T ( T/ G ) ANT ( A/C ) A ( 18 ) is present adjacent to or within the E1 element ( Fig .
1 ) .
Like SCM-1 E1 , the activation-responsive element ( ARE ) located between -88 and -60 of the murine IL-4 gene was bound by proteins from both unstimulated and stimulated nuclear extracts of EL-4 T cells ( 33 ) .
Furthermore , both constitutive and inducible 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology complexes of the IL-4 ARE contained proteins immunoreactive with anti-NF-ATp and anti-NF-ATc ( 33 ) .
In contrast to the SCM-1 E1 site , however , the AP-1 family members were clearly associated with the activation-induced complex of the IL-4 ARE ( 34 ) .
The same ARE was also critical for activation-dependent expression of the IL-4 gene in murine mast cells and was also shown to be bound by nuclear proteins from both unstimulated and stimulated mast cells ( 35 ) .
Both constitutive and inducible complexes contained proteins immunoreactive with anti-NF-ATp ( 35 ) .
In contrast to T cells , however , the AP-1 family members were not associated with the activation-inducible complex of mast cells ( 35 ) .
The observation of mast cells is thus rather similar to our present findings .
In contrast to the SCM-1 E1 site , however , the constitutive complex of ARE formed by nuclear extracts from unstimulated mast cells had an electrophoretic mobility much faster than the activation-induced complex formed by nuclear extracts from stimulated mast cells ( 35 ) .
Collectively , some NF-AT proteins appear to be constitutively present in the nuclei of certain types of cells and capable of binding to elements such as SCM-1 E1 or IL-4 ARE even without cell activation .
In fact , a protein with a molecular mass of about 41 kDa and reactive with anti-NF-ATp was shown to be present in the nuclei of unstimulated murine mast cells ( 35 ) .
It remains to be seen whether this protein is encoded by an unknown gene belonging to the NF-AT family or produced by an alternative splicing or a post-translational modification of NF-ATp .
Recently , the carboxyl-terminal end of NF-AT4/x has been shown to be required for its maximum frans-activation activity , and notably , the same sequence is well conserved in other NF-AT family proteins ( 36 ) .
Furthermore , multiple isoforms of NF-AT proteins with distinct carboxyl-terminal regions and with different frams-activation activities have been shown to be generated by alternative splicing ( 21 , 36 , 37 ) .
Thus , some isoforms of NF-ATp may be capable of trans-locating into the nucleus without cell activation and may even behave as a negative factor .
Upon cell activation , they may be replaced by transcriptionally active NF-ATp translocated from the cytoplasm through dephosphorylation by calcineurin .
Transcriptional activation may also require some de novo synthesized cofactors specific for each cell type and to be associated with NFATp .
The El element of the SCM-1 genes may be useful to explore this new aspect of transcriptional regulation by the NF-AT system .
