Both Stat3-Activation and Stat3-Independent BCL2 Downregulation Are Important for Interleukin-6-Induced Apoptosis of 1A9-M Cells By Kenji Oritani , Yoshiaki Tomiyama , Paul W. Kincade , Keisuke Aoyama , Takafumi Yokota , Itaru Matsumura , Yuzuru Kanakura , Koichi Nakajima , Toshio Hirano , and Yuji Matsuzawa A unique subclone of a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line , BMS2.4 , produces soluble factors that inhibit proliferation of several types of hematopoietic cell lines .
An understanding of these molecules may be informative about negative regulatory circuits that can potentially limit blood cell formation .
We used expression cloning to identify interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) as one factor that suppressed growth of a pre-B-cell variant line , 1A9-M .
Moreover , IL-6 induced macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis of 1A9-M cells .
During this process , IL-6 downregulated expression of BCL2 in 1A9-M cells and stimulated BCL-XL expression , but had no effect on p53 , Bax , or Bak gene expression .
Mechanisms for transduction of IL-6-induced signals were then evaluated in IL-6-stimulated 1A9-M cells .
Whereas the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) was phosphorylated and activated , there was no effect on either Stati or Stat5 .
LOOD CELL FORMATION is strictly regulated by the bone marrow microenvironmental factors , including adhesion molecules , extracellular matrix components , and cyto-kines . ' ''
Interactions between very late antigen 4 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and between CD44 and hyaluronan play an essential role , because antibodies against them blocked the production of lymphoid and/or myeloid cells in long-term bone marrow cultures . ''
Modification of cell-cell adhesion by an antibody against CD9 also blocked production of myeloid cells in Dexter cultures . ''
Regulatory cytokines in bone marrow are typically produced in extremely small quantities , and some of them are capable of binding to extracellular matrix . ''
A number of genes that may be involved in lympho-hematopoiesis have been identified by experiments using cloned stromal cell lines that were originally selected for the ability to support proliferation and/or differentiation of a particular type of hematopoietic cells .
A stromal cell line , BMS2 , which was established from adherent cells of long-term bone marrow cultures , has been shown to have the capacity to support growth of pre-B cells . ''
However , BMS2.4 , a subclone of BMS2 , has unique characteristics .
It blocked proliferation of certain types of hematopoietic cells selectively and interacted with the pH From The Second Department of Internal Medicine , The Department of Hematology/Oncology , and The Department of Molecular Oncology , Biomedical Research Center , Osaka University Medical School , Osaka , Japan ; and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation , Oklahoma City , OK .

0006-4971/99/9304-0015 $ 3.00/0 1346 The importance of BCL2 and Stat3 on IL-6-induced macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis w as studied w ith 1A9-M cells expressing human BCL2 or a dominant-negative form of Stat3 , respectively .
IL-6-induced apoptosis , but not macro-phage-differentiation , was blocked by continuously expressed BCL2 .
A dominant-negative form of Stat3 inhibited both macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis induced by IL-6 .
However , diminished Stat3 activity did not prevent IL-6-induced downregulation of the BCL2 gene .
Therefore , activation of Stat3 is essential for IL-6-induced macrophage-differentiation and programmed cell death in this model .
Whereas overexpression of BCL2 abrogates the apoptotic response , Stat3-independent signals appear to dow late expression of the BCL2 gene .

We now report that interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is one of the growth-suppressors produced by BMS2.4 cells .
Recombinant human IL-6 as well as the supernatant of cells transfected with mouse IL-6 cDNA induced macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis of 1A9-M cells , a variant 1A9 pre-B-cell line .
IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cells. ! ''
IL-6 induces terminal differentiation of B cells to antibody-producing cells , proliferation of myeloma cells , and production of acute-phase proteins by hepatocytes . ''
IL-6 also induces macrophage differentiation of several myeloid cell lines , including M1 and Y6 .
`` * `` Recent studies have shown that IL-6 induced phosphorylation and activation of signal transduction molecules , such as Janus kinases ( JAK1 , JAK2 , and Tyk2 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription family proteins ( Statl and Stat3 ) .
' % '' In particular , activation of the Stat3 molecule has been shown to be essential for IL-6-induced macrophage-differentiation of M1 cells. ? ''
We describe here two IL-6-induced signal transduction pathways that lead to macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis of 1A9-M cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
A stromal cell line BMS2 and its subclone , BMS2.4 , were cultured in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Flow Laboratories , North Ryde , Australia ) .
1A9 , a pre-B-cell line , and its variant line , designated 1A9-M , were cultured in McCoy 's 5A medium supplemented with 5 % FCS and 5 X 107 '' mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol . ''
The 1A9-M line has rearranged both JH alleles .
However , one JH allele is different from the original 1A9 line and therefore may have undergone a secondary rearrangement .
1A9-M has also lost expression of IgM and CD19 .
Lymphoma cell lines ( 7OZ/3 and EL4 ) , an IL-3-dependent pro-B-cell line ( BaF3 ) , and myeloid leukemia cell lines ( FDCP1 and WEHI3 ) were maintained as previously described .

MACROPHAGE DIFFERENTIATION AND APOPTOSIS transformants were selected with 1 mg/mL of G418 ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) .
Expression cloning and sequence analysis .
| Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from BMS2.4 cells using a Fast Track mRNA isolation kit ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized with a TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) , ligated with BstXI adaptors ( Invitrogen ) , and cloned into a mammalian expression vector , pEF-BOS ( a kind gift of Dr S. Nagata , Osaka Bioscience Institute , Osaka , Japan ) .
Plasmid cDNAs were purified from pools of a few hundreds of clones and were transfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation .
Supernatants from each transfectant were added to cultures of 1A9-M cells , and positive pools were identified by growth suppression of 1A9-M cells .
Positive pools were divided into progressively smaller pools and rescreened until single clones were isolated .
The inserts of the single clones were subcloned into pBluescript ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) , and nucleotide sequence was determined using an automated DNA sequencer ( Applied Biosys-tems , Foster City , CA ) .
Nucleotide data base searching was performed with BLAST from the GCG computer program ( Genetics Computer Group , Madison , WD .
Flow cytometry .
Antibody incubations and washing steps were performed at 4°C in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 3 % heat-inactivated FCS and 0.1 % sodium azide .
Cells were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Antibodies used in this study were as follows : fluorescein isothiocya-nate ( FITC ) -conjugated antimouse CD32/CD16 ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) and phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated antimouse F4/80 ( Caltag , San Francisco , CA ) .
Isotype-matched Igs were used for controls .
Cell cycle analysis .

The fixed cells were incubated with 300 uL of staining buffer ( 1 mg/mL RNase , 20 ug/mL propidium iodide , and 0.01 % NP-40 in PBS ) at 37°C for 10 minutes .
The DNA contents in the nucleus of the cells were analyzed with FACSort ( Becton Dickinson ) using Cell Quest software .
DNA fragmentation assay .
- Fragmentation of DNA was assayed as previously described . '' ''
After stimulation with IL-6 , 1A9-M cells ( 1 X 10 '' ) were lysed in 0.4 mL lysis buffer containing 200 mmol/L Tris-HCI , 100 mmol/L EDTA , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and 50 ug/mL proteinase K ( Sigma ) and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C .
DNAs were extracted with phenol and then with chloroform/isoamylalcohol .
The aqueous phase was collected and precipitated with NaCl and ethanol .
DNA pellets were suspended in 0.4 mL TE buffer and treated with 50 ug/mL RNase for 5 hours and then with 200 ug/mL proteinase K for 5 hours .
DNAs were extracted twice and precipitated as described above .
DNA pellets were resuspended in TE buffer , separated by electrophore-sis in 1 % agarose gel ( 1 ug DNA per lane ) , stained with 0.5 ug/mL ethidium bromide , and visualized under UV light .
Luciferase assay .
A luciferase construct , 4X APRE-Luc , which contains a Stat3-binding sequence , was used as a reporter gene . ''
Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , in which transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfected pRL-CMV-Rluc , an expression vector for renilla luciferase .
The cultured cells were electroporated with 30 ug of reporter gene together with 30 ug of pRL-CMV-Rluc .
The transfected cells were serum-starved for 12 hours and then stimulated with 20 ng/mL IL-6 for 5 hours .
The cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplied by the manufactuer , followed by measurement of the firefly and the renilla luciferase activities on luminometer LB96P ( Berthold Japan , Tokyo , Japan ) .
The relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to the renilla luciferase activities .
Northern blot analysis .
Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol Reagent ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) , electrophoresed through a formaldehyde agarose gel , and transferred onto a nylon membrane 1347 ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
The cDNA fragments were labeled with [ °°P ] dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) and hybridized to the membrane .
Blots were then washed and autoradiographed .
Fragments of the BCL2 , BCL-XL , Bak , Bax , p53 , and B-actin genes were used as materials for probes . ''
Western blot analysis .
- The isolation of cellular lysates , gel electro-phoresis , and immunoblotting was performed according to the methods described previously , with minor modifications . ''
Briefly , 1A9-M cells were lysed in lysis buffer , and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation .

A mouse antihuman BCL2 antibody , a mouse antimouse BCL2 antibody , and a rabbit antimouse BCL-X antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
RESULTS Supernatant of BMS2.4 suppressed growth of certain hematopoietic cell lines .
- BMS2.4 is an unique subclone of the BMS2 stromal cell line .
In contrast to the parent line that supports proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid and myeloid precursors , BMS2.4 inhibits the growth of some hematopoietic cell types . ''
We evaluated whether these inhibitory effects were mediated by soluble factors or cell surface molecules .
As shown in Fig 1 , proliferation of several hematopoietic cell lines ( 1A9 , 70Z/3 , 1A9-M , and WEHI3 ) was suppressed by BMS2.4 conditioned medium , whereas that of FDCP1 , BaF3 , and EL4 cell lines was not affected .
Supernatants derived from the parent BMS2 line were not suppressive for any hematopoietic cell lines tested .
The 1A9-M cells appeared to be particularly sensitive to inhibition by BMS2.4 and were used in subsequent attempts to identify inhibitory factors .
The growth-inhibitory activity was not blocked by neutralizing antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-a , tumor growth factor- , or interferon- ( data not shown ) .

Approximately 1.2 X 105 clones were screened on the basis of growth inhibition of 1A9-M cells as described in Materials and Methods , and 6 clones were isolated .
Plasmids from each positive clone were transfected into 293T cells , and supernatants of the transfectants were collected after 3 days of incubation .
1A9-M cells were cultured with or without the supernatants for 3 days , and recovered viable cells were measured by hemocytometer .
The nucleotide sequences of the inserts from the single clones were determined using an automated DNA sequencer .
Identification of IL-6 as one inhibitory cytokine secreted by BMS2.4 cells .
Expression cloning of growth inhibitory substances was performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Approximately 1.2 X 10° clones of the BMS2.4 expression library were screened on the basis of growth inhibition of 1A9-M cells , and 6 clones were isolated ( Table 1 ) .
Supernatants of 293T cells that were transfected with plasmids prepared from these clones showed more than 90 % suppression of proliferation of 1A9-M cells .
Sequencing showed that all 6 clones contained mouse IL-6 cDNA inserts .
Moreover , proliferation of 1A9-M cells was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner when recombinant human IL-6 was added to cultures ( Fig 2 ) .
Addition of a neutralizing antibody to mouse IL-6 ( Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) cancelled approximately 90 % of the growth inhibitory effect of BMS2.4 supernatant on 1A9-M cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , IL-6 represents one major substance produced by BMS2.4 cells that can arrest growth of 1A9-M cells .

MACROPHAGE DIFFERENTIATION AND APOPTOSIS began to express Fc receptor ( CD32/CD16 ) and a F4/80 antigen , a macrophage-specific antigen , after IL-6 treatment ( Fig 3B ) .
1A9-M cells started to die within 48 hours of culture with IL-6 ( Fig 4A ) .
To clarify the mechanism of cell death , nuclear DNA contents of 1 A9-M cells cultured with IL-6 were analyzed by flow cytometry .
As shown in Fig 4B , the proportion of GO-G1 population increased within 24 hours ( 36.8 % before stimulation ; 46.4 % 24 hours after stimulation ) , and the subdiploid peak appeared within 48 hours ( 0.2 % before stimulation ; 43.17 % 48 hours after stimulation ) .
Moreover , DNA obtained from 1A9-M cells cultured with IL-6 for more than 48 hours showed extensive degradation with oligonucleosomal fragments ( Fig 4C ) .
Therefore , IL-6 induces macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis of 1A9-M cells .
Whereas growth of a related pre-B-cell line , 1A9 , was sensitive to factors produced by BMS2.4 ( Fig 1 ) , they were not influenced in any obvious way by IL-6 .
IL-6 modulated expression of apoptosis-related genes .
To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in 1A9-M cell responses to IL-6 , we evaluated expression of some apoptosis-related genes by Northern blot analysis .
As shown in Fig 5A , 1A9-M cells constitutively expressed BCL2 and Bax genes .
Expression of the BCL2 gene was downregulated within 24 hours after stimulation with IL-6 .
In contrast , expression of the BCL-XL gene was induced by IL-6 treatment .
Expression of Bax was not affected by IL-6 and neither the Bak nor the p53 gene was expressed by these cells at a level detectable by Northern blot .
The BCL2 and BCL-XL proteins were also == ] A 100 f 4a & i O Medium @ IL-6 20ng/ml bo & 1 Relative Cell Number Viability ( % ) 3 __ S & o 4 1 2 3 Culture ( Days ) 1349 evaluated by Western blot analysis .
As shown in Fig 5B , 1 A9-M cells lost BCL2 protein within 36 hours of stimulation with IL-6 .
Although expression of BCL-XL mRNA was induced by IL-6 treatment , the protein was undetectable even when 1 A9-M cells were treated with IL-6 ( data not shown ) .
Constitutive expression of BCL2 suppressed IL-6-induced apoptosis but not macrophage-differentiation of 1A9-M cells .
Because IL-6 downregulated gene expression of BCL2 , an antiapoptotic gene , we evaluated the importance of this change for IL-6-induced responses .
A human BCL2-expression plas-mid , pSVBT , was stably transfected into 1¥A9-M cells , and 3 individual clones that expressed human BCL2 under the control of a SV40 promoter ( 1 A9-M/BCL2 ) were obtained .
The amount of gene and protein expression of endogenous and exogenous BCL2 of 1A9-M/BCL2 clones was confirmed by Northern and Western blot analysis ( Fig 6A and B ) .
The1A9-M/BCL2 clones were cultured in the presence of IL-6 for 48 hours , and neither loss of viability nor apoptotic changes were observed ( Table 2 ) .
However , the 1 A9-M/BCL2 clones did acquire the macrophage-like morphology , along with CD32/CD16 and F4/80 antigens after treatment with IL-6 ( Table 3 ) .
These findings indicate that programmed cell death is not coupled to differentiation in the 1A9-M cell line and BCL2 is sufficient to block IL-6-induced apoptosis .
Expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 blocked both IL-6-induced apoptosis and macrophage-differentiation of 1A9-M cells .

To evaluate the importance of Stat3-mediated signals to IL-6-induced macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis , we stably transfected a pCAGGS-Neo-HA-Stat3D plasmid into 1A9-M cells .
Twenty individual clones were obtained that expressed a dominant-negative form of Stat3 carrying mutations at positions important for DNA binding ( 1A9-M/ST3D ) .
All 1A9-M/ST3D clones showed diminished levels of IL-6-activated transcription from the 4X APRE reporter plasmid that contains a potential Stat3-binding sequence ( Fig 6C and data not shown ) .
We then examined biological responses of the 1A9-M/ST3D clones to IL-6 .
Neither macrophage-differentiation nor apoptosis was induced by IL-6 when Stat3 functions were disrupted .
Eighteen of 20 1A9-M/ST3D clones ( clone 1-18 ) did not undergo apoptosis in response to IL-6 ( Table 2 and data not shown ) .
They also exhibit neither morphological changes nor acquisition of macrophage antigens in response to IL-6 ( Table 3 and data not shown ) .
Thus , Stat3 was likely to mediate signals for IL-6-induced macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis of 1A9-M cells .

One clone ( 1A9-M/ST3D clone A ) had slight macrophage differentiation , although its viability was retained .
Approximately 30 % of cells became apoptotic in another stable clone ( 1A9-M/ST3D clone B ) , without differentiation into macrophages .
Stat3 was not involved in downregulation of BCL2 gene expression by IL-6 .
Experiments described above indicated that BCL2 might be a critical determinant for life/death decisions in 1A9-M cells that are exposed to IL-6 .
It seemed possible that the IL-6-induced downregulation of BCL2 gene expression might be dependent on Stat3 .

Surface expression of CD32/CD16 and a F4/80 antigen was evaluated by flow cytometry .
To determine morphological changes into macrophages , cultured cells were stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa .
The increase of cells expressing F4/80 antigen or CD32 and morphologically macrophage-like cells by IL-6 treatment is shown as the mean + SD of triplicate cultures .
1351 ated BCL2 transcripts in the 1A9-M/ST3D clones before and after stimulation with IL-6 .
As shown in Fig 7 , IL-6 downregulated BCL2 gene expression within 24 hours in all of the 1A9-M/ST3D clones to an equivalent degree as in the control .
DISCUSSION BMS2.4 stromal cells probably produce multiple factors that modulate the survival and growth of hematopoietic cells .
Their identification may be helpful in understanding cytokines that limit blood cell production under steady state or conditions associated with unusual demands .
We used the particularly sensitive 1A9-M , a pre-B-cell line , and expression cloning to determine that IL-6 is one of the active substances produced by BMS2.4 .
The 1A9-M cells underwent remarkable changes in morphology , expressed macrophage surface markers , and then underwent apoptosis in response to IL-6 .
We demonstrated that these dramatic responses are dependent on specific components of the JAK-STAT pathway and that independent signaling mechanisms account for downregulation of BCL2 expression .
Lymphocyte lines and normal IL-7-responding cells were unaffected by IL-6 , but inhibited by BMS2.4 supernatant .
Therefore , the BMS2.4 line must make other negative lympho-poietic regulators that can be investigated using a similar experimental strategy .
The 1A9-M cell line was chosen for screening an expression library because of its sensitivity to BMS2.4 supernatant inhibition .
However , it is also remarkable in its ability to undergo an apparent lineage switch before programmed cell death .

A dominant-negative form of Stat3 did not inhibit IL-6-induced repression of BCL2 mRNA expression .
1A9-M cells transfected with either a control vector ( 1A9-M/pCAGGS clone 1 and 2 ) or a pCAGGS-Neo-HA-Stat3D plasmid ( 1A9-M/ST3D clone 1 and 2 ) were cultured with or without 20 ng/mL IL-6 for 24 hours .
Total RNAs were isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis using cDNAs of BCL2 and B-actin as probes .

1352 examples of pre-B cells that have undergone a macrophage-like change .
In some cases , the change was spontaneous ( HATFL and 70Z/3 ) , in others it was induced by a proto-oncogene or ectopic expression of the c-fms macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor . ''
This may indicate that commitment between these two cell lineages involves relatively few transcription factors .
Regardless , we are unaware of another cell line that undergoes this change before programmed cell death .
Whereas two myeloid cell lines , M1 and Y6 , were previously found to undergo macrophage-differentiation in response to IL-6 , 1 A9-M cells may provide a unique model for exploring IL-6-dependent mechanisms .
Stat family members were originally identified as transcription factors responsible for interferon-w- and interferon-y-dependent gene expression . '' ''
All Stat molecules have an SH2 domain , which recognizes phosphotyrosine in a specific peptide motif , and are generally involved in cytokine signal transduc-tion .
'* '' For examples , Stat1 is known to be involved in innate immunity .
`` * '' '' Statd4 is activated by IL-12 and is involved in the development of natural killer and T-helper type 1 cells .
`` * '' '' Stat6 is involved in Ig E production and lymphocyte proliferation in response to IL-4 . ''
The JAK-STAT pathway also mediates signal transduction through the IL-6 receptor subunit , gp130 .
JAK1 , JAK2 , and Tyk2 constitutively associate with gp130 and respond to IL-6.4° These activated tyrosine kinases , in turn , phosphorylate and activate the Stat family proteins , especially Statl and Stat3 for IL-6.4'42 Recently , it was reported that gp130 mutants without any of YXXQ motifs required for Stat3 activation did not activate Stat3 or induce terminal differentiation of M1 cells . ''
Moreover , it was shown that dominant-negative forms of Stat3 inhibited IL-6-induced macrophage-differentiation of M1 transformants . ?
Although these findings indicate that Stat3 may be important for IL-6-induced macro-phage-differentiation , all of the experiments were performed using the M1 cell line .
We now report similar observations with 1A9-M cells and can conclude that the phenomena may be general .
Apoptosis plays an important role in a wide variety of physiological processes , including removal of redundant cells during development , elimination of autoreactive lymphocytes , and eradication of old and differentiated cells in most adult tissues with self-renewal capacity . '' ''
Apoptosis of monocytes and macrophages has emerged as a central regulatory event in hematopoiesis and inflammation , and inflammatory cytokines can promote or prevent their apoptosis . ''
A number of genes , such as Bax , Bak , p53 , BCL2 , and BCL-XL , have been reported to control apoptosis of cells and to alter their gene expression during differentiation . ''
In 1A9-M cells , IL-6 induced both macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis .
Expression of p53 and Bak genes was not detected in 1A9-M cells , and BCL-XL was induced by IL-6 treatment .
In contrast , expression of BCL2 was downregulated by IL-6 treatment .
Because BCL2 is an inhibitor of apoptosis , downregulation of BCL2 may be related to IL-6-induced apoptosis of 1 A9-M cells .
Indeed , downregulation of gene and protein expression of BCL2 may be important for apoptosis , because constitutively expressed BCL2 blocked IL-6-induced programmed cell death .
The cAMP response-binding proteins , p53 , and c-myb are known to regulate BCL2 gene expression positively or negatively in a variety of cells .
`` ? 52 ORITANI ET AL In a pro-B-cell line , the tyrosine residue in the YXXQ motifs of gp130 that is essential for Stat3 activation is required for BCL2 induction and antiapoptotic effects . '' ''
However , in 1 A9-M cells , Stat3 was not related to regulation of BCL2 , because a dominant-negative form of Stat3 did not block IL-6-induced downregulation of BCL2 expression .
On the other hand , a Stat3-dependent pathway is also required for IL-6-induced apoptosis of 1 A9-M cells , because a dominant-negative form of Stat3 maintained their viability .
We could speculate that there is induction of apoptosis-related genes other than p53 , Bak , and Bax or reduction of some antiapoptotic genes beside BCL2 and BCL-XL .
In M1 cells , Stat3 is involved in IL-6-induction of several genes , such as the junB , interferon regulatory factor-1 , a CDK inhibitor p19N** '' , and Stat3 itself , and in repression of c-myb and c-myc that may regulate macrophage-differentiation and G1 growth arrest .
`` `` *~ '' '' It will be interesting to analyze molecular mechanisms through which the Stat3-dependent signalings induce apoptosis in 1 A9-M cells .
We created stable 1A9-M transfectants using a dominant-negative form of Stat3 and found that they have three patterns of response to IL-6 .
Eighteen of 20 1A9-M/ST3D did not differentiate to macrophages or undergo apoptosis in response to IL-6 .
The 1A9-M/ST3D clone A differentiated to macrophages without apoptosis .
In contrast , the 1A9-M/ST3D clone B died by apoptosis without macrophage-differentiation when stimulated .
These three groups of cells differ from untransfected 1A9-M cells that differentiated to macrophages and died in response to IL-6 .
Because the mutated Stat3 interfered with DNA binding of endogenous Stat3 in all 1A9-M/ST3D clones , a second mutation due to prolonged selection might occur in the exceptional clones ( clone A and B ) .
These cells are suitable for substrates of subtraction techniques , and further analysis may show the molecular mechanisms through which IL-6 induces macrophage-differentiation and apoptosis .
