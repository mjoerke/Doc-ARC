Scott , Takashi Fujita , Hsiou-Chi Lion , Garry P. Nolan , '' and David Baltimore The Rockefeller University , New York , New York 10021 USA , ; 'Department of Pharmacology , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 USA Transcription factor NF-KB ( p50/p65 ) is generally localized to the cytoplasm by its inhibitor IB .
Overproduced IxB , free from NF- « B , is rapidly degraded .
Overexpression of p65 increases endogenous IB protein in both carcinoma and lymphoid cells by two mechanisms : protein stabilization and increased transcription of IxB mRNA .
In contrast , p65A , a naturally occurring splice variant , fails to markedly augment IxB protein levels .
Both overexpressed p65 and coexpressed p50 are cytoplasmic , whereas p65A is partly nuclear , indicating that the IxB induced by p65 can maintain NF- « B in the cytoplasm .
Thus , p65 and IB are linked in an autoregulatory loop , ensuring that NF-B is held in the cytoplasm until cells are specifically induced to translocate it to the nucleus .
[ Key Words : NF- « B ; autoregulation ; B-cell development } Received March 22 , 1993 ; revised version accepted April 20 , 1993 .
NF- « B is a widely expressed factor important for transcription of the immunoglobulin xk gene in mature B-lymphoid cells and for rapid response to external stimuli in other cells ( Blank et al .
1992 ; Nolan and Baltimore 1992 ) .
NF-kB is composed of two subunits , p50 and p65 , that associate with a third protein , IB , in many cell types ( Baeuerle and Baltimore 1989 ) .
p50 and p65 exhibit amino-terminal homology to the proto-oncogene c-rel , heterodimerize through interaction sites in their Rel homology domains , and bind to kB sites in a variety of genes to stimulate transcription ( Ghosh et al .
1990 ; Kieran et al .
1990 ; Zabel et al .
1991 ) .
In addition to its Rel homology region , p65 contains an acidic carboxyl terminus that functions in transcriptional activation ( Nolan et al .
1991 ; Ruben et al .
1991 ; Fujita et al .
1992 ) .
A naturally occurring splice variant of p65 , p65A , which lacks 10 rel-homologous amino acids , has been suggested to transform Rat-1 fibroblasts and to exhibit differential expression during hemopoietic cell development ( Narayanan et al .
1992 ) .
The 38-kD protein , I « xB- « , that copuri-fies with NF- « B and inhibits its binding to DNA , can be dissociated from p50/p65 by deoxycholate ( Baeuerle and Baltimore 1988 ; Zabel and Baeuerle 1991 ) .
A cDNA clone , MAD-3 , originally isolated from adherent macro-phages , encodes a protein that exhibits the properties of and contains peptide sequences from IxB- « ( Davis et al .
1991 ; Haskill et al .
1991 ; Link et al .
1992 ) .
Notable in its sequence are repeats of a motif present in cde10 , SWI , SWIG and the erythrocyte structural protein ankyrin { ankyrin repeat ; Andrews and Herskowitz 1989 ; Lux et al .
1990 ] .
The mechanisms controlling the levels of NF-KB constituents are not yet established .
Transient activation of NF- « B can be achieved in many cells by treatment with stimuli like active phorbol esters ( PMA ) or lipopolysac-charide ( LPS ; Sen and Baltimore 1986 ) .
PMA stimulates protein kinase C , which can phosphorylate IxB in vitro , eliminating its ability to inhibit DNA binding by p50/ p65 ( Ghosh and Baltimore 1990 ) .
Thus , the control of NF- « B may involve , at least partially , the controlled phosphorylation of IxB .
We have found that p65 overexpression , directed either by transfection or by retroviral infection , causes a striking increase in endogenous IxB- « protein .
The induced IxB-a « is quite stable .
It differs markedly in this sense from IkB-a overproduced by plasmid-directed ex-pression , which is short-lived .
Combination of IxB- « with p65 then appears to stabilize the inhibitor protein , explaining part of the increased IxB- « produced by p65 expression .
Overexpression of p65 also induces increased IkB-a mRNA ; run-on experiments show that the increase is the result of a highly specific stimulation of transcription .
In contrast to p65 , retrovirus-directed expression of the 10-amino-acid natural deletion mutant p65A fails to increase intracellular levels of IxB- « .
p65A binds with lower affinity to IkB and does not activate transcription from « B-dependent promoters ( Ruben et al .
1992 ) .
The localization of overproduced p65 and p65A reflects their ability to induce IKB : p65 is cytoplasmic , whereas p65A is partly nuclear .
In addition , coexpressed p50 and p65 are maintained in the cytoplasm owing to the induced IxB , whereas p50 alone is nuclear .
These findings are explained most simply by the idea that IxB-a induced by p65 maintains NF- « B in the cytoplasm .
Therefore , it appears that this system of proteins is au-toregulated through the ability of p65 to determine the 1266 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 7:1266-1276 © 1993 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/93 $ 5.00 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press level of IxB-a « protein .
Similar conclusions were reached in two articles published while this paper was being reviewed ( Brown et al .

Results IxB levels parallel those of p65 , not pG65A cDNAs coding for IxB-a « , p65 , and p65A were each inserted into a retroviral vector and then transfected by the calcium phosphate technique into 293 cells ( human embryonic kidney cells transformed by the adenovirus ElA protein ) .
Using Western blotting to detect the protein , untransfected cells exhibited nearly undetectable levels of p65 , whereas lysates prepared 48 hr after transfection with each of three separately prepared constructs contained high levels of p65 ( Fig .
1A , lanes 5-7 ) .
The untransfected cells also had virtually undetectable levels of IxB- « , but the cells that made p65 contained a large quantity of IxB- « ( Fig .
1B , lanes 5-7 ) .
This inductive effect was specific to wild-type p65 , because control cells transfected with the activated tyrosine kinase v-abl , the IxB-like molecule be/-3 , or empty vector [ pGD ) alone showed no increase in IkB-a { lanes 1-4,8 ) .
The levels of IkB-a induced by p65 were surprisingly high .
By Western blotting , the amount of p65-dependent I « xB- « was similar to that achieved through retroviral expression of the IxB- « gene product alone ( lane 9 ) .
In contrast , cells transfected with the p65A construct produced p6S5A but exhibited little , if any , induction of IxB-a « expression ( lane 11 ) compared with cells transfected with the parent retroviral vector { lane 8 ) ; at most , a twofold increase might occur compared with the very marked increase induced by p65 .

Lysates were prepared from separate dishes of cells that were transfected simultaneously with a p65 construct and harvested at the times indicated in Figure 2 .
Western blotting and detection with antibodies to p65 revealed low levels of the proteins until 24 hr after trans-fection .
IkB-a levels in the same lysates remained low at early time points and rose only when p65 was seen [ Fig .
2B , lanes 7,8 ) .
The striking parallels between p65 and IxB- « expression were not limited to transfected or adherent cells .
To introduce the p65 retroviral expression construct into pre-B and B cells by retroviral transduction , we first cotransfected 293 cells with both the replication-defec-tive p65 retrovirus construct and a clone encoding rep-lication-competent Moloney murine leukemia virus { [ MuLV } to generate virus stocks that could infect murine 707/3 and WEHI 231 cells .
Two days after transfection , lymphoid cells were added to the transfected ( adherent ) producer cells and cocultured for 24 hr .
Medium containing the infected nonadherent lymphoid cells was then aspirated from the coculture .
Lysates from the nonadherent cells were analyzed by Western blotting .
Like the transfected 293 cells , both murine B-lymphoid cell types expressed elevated amounts of IxB- « after introduction of the p65 gene ( p65 levels in Fig .
3A ; IxB- « levels in Fig .

The p65 and IxB-a « that we detected were unlikely to result from contamination of the nonadherent cell population by retrovirus-producing 293 cells for two rea-sons : ( 1 ) Free virus infection of and WEHI 231 cells has been carried out with identical , but quantita-tively less , impressive results { data not shown ) ; ( 2 ) human nonadherent lymphoid [ ( Namalwa ) cells that are not infectable by ecotropic murine virus were cocultivated o w < = s tor Con 3 a a a 9 m o a & & 3 7 Goo g s 3 § s o < $ 3 B > R § 5 a a & 2 Z & & a muss $ 4 muses .

with retrovirus-producing 293 cells by the same protocol and displayed no detectable level of p65 or IxB- « ( data not shown ) .
We therefore conclude that IxB- « levels in a variety of cell types may be determined by the levels of p65 expression in those cells .
The mechanism of increased IxB expression is multifactorial To determine the mechanism of increased IxB- « expression in p65-transfected cells , we first carried out protein-labeling experiments .
293 cells were transfected with either a retroviral p65 construct or an IkB- « [ MAD-3 ) retroviral plasmid and labeled for 30 min with [ °°S ) me-thionine .
Immunoprecipitations at the times indicated after labeling showed that the half-life of p65 was long , on the order of 12-24 hr ( Fig .
4A ; despite strongly denaturing lysis and wash conditions , a smaller protein that migrates at a size identical to overexpressed was 1268 GENES & DEVELOPMENT also observed in the immunoprecipitations of p65 ) .
Overexpressed IxB- « was , in the absence of p65 , a very short-lived protein with a t , , , of ~30 min ( Fig .
4B ) .
Immuno-precipitation of IkB- « from p65-transfected cells { Fig .
4C , D ) showed that protein stabilization was a significant factor in increasing the levels of the inhibitor .
In the presence of p65 , the half-life of IkB-a was extended at least 25-fold to > 12 hr ( Fig .
4D ) .
The upper limit of the half-life is not clearly established by the above experi-ment , which was carried out three times with no reproducible drop in the amount of protein detected 24 hr after labeling .
To investigate the importance of transcription or mRNA stabilization to the observed increase in IKB- « protein levels , poly { A } -containing RNA from 293 cells transfected with retroviral p65 , p65A , or pGD vectors was isolated and hybridized with p65- and IxB-o-specific probes .
Specifically bound probe was quantitated using a PhosphorImager .
Cells transfected with the p65 or p65A constructs exhibited the expected 20- to 50-fold increases of p65 mRNA ( Fig .
5A ) .
Importantly , the p65-transfected cells contained approximately seven times as much IxB- « mRNA as did cells transfected with p65A or the pGD vector [ Fig .
5B ) .
Thus , p65 can both stabilize IkB-a protein and increase the steady-state concentration of its mRNA .
To determine whether the increased IxB-a mRNA was the result of increased transcription of the gene , we carried out nuclear run-on studies .
We used retroviruses to introduce rel- or IxB-related genes into NIH-3T3 cells and obtain run-on RNA free of contaminating plasmid sequences .

( A ) Separate plates of 293 cells were transfected with pGD-p65-34 DNA or pGD vector DNA ( mock , lane 1 } .
Thirty-six hours after addition of the DNA , all plates were starved in methionine-free medium for 30 min , and pulse labeled with [ °**SJmethionine for 30 min .
All cells were then refed with normal medium .
Just after feeding , lysates were prepared from mock-transfected cells and pGD-p65-transfected cells ( time 0 , lane 2 ) .
Lysates from separate plates were then prepared at the times indicated ( in hours ) and stored at -70°C .
All samples were then immunoprecipitated using anti-p65 serum , resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels , and autoradiographed .
( B ) Separate plates of 293 cells were transfected with retroviral DNAs encoding IxB- « { [ pGD-MAD-3-10 ) or pGD vector alone ( mock ] and processed as described in A .
These IxB-o-transfected cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified anti-IxB- « antibody , analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels , and autoradiographed .
( C , D ) Separate plates of 293 cells were transfected with pGD-p65-34 DNA or pGD vector DNA ( mock , lane 1 ) .
Thirty-six hours after the addition of the DNA , all plates were labeled with [ **S ) methionine , refed , and lysed at the indicated times ( in hours ) after labeling as before .
Lysates from each plate were then divided .
Half of the lysate from a given time point was immunoprecipitated using anti-p65 serum ( C ) ; the other half was precipitated with anti-IxB- « antibody ( D ] .
The precipitates were analyzed on separate SDS-polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed as shown .
agglutinin ( HA ) epitope-tagged variant of p50 , p65 , p65A , bel-3 , and IxB- « were tested .
RNAs from the nuclei of infected cells were in vitro labeled and hybridized to immobilized plasmid DNAs coding for various rel- and IxB-related genes , as well as others [ Fig .
6 ) .
In each case , the increased transcription of the retrovirally transduced gene was detected .
The only endogenous gene that responded to any retroviral infection was the IxB- « gene ; its transcription rate increased 5- to 10-fold after infection by the p65-encoding retrovirus ( lane 3 ) but not after infection with the other viruses .
Although strong binding between p50 and both bel-3 and IxB-y have been demonstrated ( Franzoso et al .
1992 ; Wulezyn et al .
1992 ) , no transcriptional response to p50 overproduction was evi- dent among any of the genes tested .
Thus , p65 specifically increases the rate of IkB-a transcription , accounting for the increased steady-state amount of IkB-a mRNA .
Localization of p65 A central tenet of previous thinking about IxB/NF- « B regulation has been the idea that functional IB tethers NF-kB in the cytoplasm of cells where it is dormant .
Therefore , if the IkB-a protein induced by p65 is func-tional , overexpressed p65 should be confined to the cytoplasm .
To determine the subcellular localization of p65 , we used helper-containing retroviral stocks to transmit the p65 gene to NIH-3T3 cells for immunofluores- GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1269 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Scott et al .

cence studies .
Under the staining conditions used , endogenous p65 was essentially undetectable [ Fig .
7A , B ) .
As predicted , retrovirally transduced wild-type p65 was almost completely limited to the cytoplasm [ Fig .
7C ) .
In contrast , the transcriptionally inactive p65A was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of infected cells ( Fig .
7D ) .
If the p65 regulatory effect is the central mode of NF-xB regulation , then the induced IkB should maintain the whole NF- « B complex in the cytoplasm .
To test this possibility , we simultaneously infected NIH-3T3 cells with retroviral stocks that could transmit NF- « B p50 { tagged at its amino terminus with a 9-amino-acid influenza virus HA epitope and detectable by a mouse monoclonal antibody ; Field et al .
1988 ) or p65 ( detectable by specific rabbit antiserum ) .
Immunofluorescence staining 2 days after infection [ Fig .
8 ) revealed populations of cells singly infected by either p50- or p65-transducing viruses , cells simultaneously infected by viruses transducing both genes , and uninfected cells .
Figure 8A is the phase photomicrograph of a field in which one cell overexpressing 1270 GENES & DEVELOPMENT p65 is stained with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody ( Fig .
8B ) ; neighboring cells lack expression .
Examination using a thodaminated anti-mouse antibody ( Fig .
8C ) shows that the p65-expressing cell is also expressing p50 and that both molecules are wholly cytoplasmic .
As a control , another cell in the field expresses p50 but not p65 .
Its fluorescence is entirely nuclear .
Thus , the IxB-a induced by p65 maintains the p50/p65 NF- « B complex in the cytoplasm , even at very high levels of expression .
In contrast , p50 alone induces only a small amount of IxB ( data not shown } , and virtually all of the protein is found in the nucleus .
Discussion NF- « B p50/p65 heterodimers in most cells are held in the cytoplasm by an inhibitor molecule , IxB .
In many cell types , specific signals such as LPS , PMA , or TNF-a can release p50/p65 from IxB , causing transport of transcriptionally active heterodimers to the nucleus .
This scheme requires that inhibitor levels in unstimulated cells always equal or exceed transcription factor levels .
Our studies suggest that the importance of controlling transcription from B-dependent genes is such that higher organisms have evolved at least two ways to assure parity of NF-kB and IxB levels .
First , p65-dependent stabilization of IxB- « protein can increase inhibitor half-life at least 25-fold .
Because p65 is stable , but free IxB- « is unstable , cells must make a large molar excess of IxB- « that is available to be stabilized by any increased synthesis of p65 .
Second , IxB- « mRNA levels are at least sevenfold inducible by p65 as a consequence of increased transcription of the IxB- « gene .
Therefore , even larger increases of p65 can trigger increased synthesis of IxB-a .
Stabilization of IkB-a We found that the half-life of retrovirally expressed IxB- « , free from p65 , is short ( ~30 min } .
Similar to findings by Sun et al .
( 1993 ) and Brown et al .
( 1993 ) , published while this paper was being reviewed , we have observed the rapid disappearance of endogenous IxB after PMA or LPS treatment of pre-B cells , presumably reflecting the difference in half-life between the unstable free and longer-lived bound forms ( H.-C. Liou , M.L .
Scott , and D. Baltimore , unpubl . ) .
Two structural features of IkB-a predict a short half-life for the free protein .
The two amino acids just following the initiating methionine ( F and Q ) are by the amino-end rule `` destabilizing '' residues ( Bach-mair and Varshavsky 1989 ) ; interestingly , two lysine res-idues , 18 amino-acids carboxy-terminal to the Q , are at a distance such that one or both could serve as acceptors for ubiquitin and target the protein for degradation ( Her-shko 1991 ) .
Also , the presence of PEST sequences associated with rapid protein turnover has been noted previously [ Rogers et al .
1986 ; Haskill et al .
1991 ) .
Thus , binding of IxB-a « to p65 must prevent the inhibitor molecule from interacting with one or more degradative pathways Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Virus ® & w p p f AN o kel ka k $ $ ¢ ] [ y « / p50 - ® « ame p6S « o | @ @ c-rel < ZC p100 as bel-3 « am S| - IxB- « a m & IxBy < 3 cA c-myc waa B actin __ « waw site age latte dt me CAPDE ( me mm | anl ( ae ae = e pBSK 1 2 3 4 5 6 in the cell .
In unstimulated cells , IxB-a is probably made in excess , with the unbound fraction being continually degraded , such that fluctuations in the level of p65 will not lead to the unprogrammed nuclear appearance of NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) or ( p65 ) , .
This suggests a mechanism by which cells that have cytoplasmic NF-kB ( p50/65 ) can also have nuclear [ p50 ] , ( KBF-1 ; Kieran et al .
1990 ) .
If p50 were made in excess over p65 , its transport to the nucleus would not be inhibited by IxB- « .
Consistent with this idea , we have observed that overexpression of p50 induces a small amount of IxB- « but has no effect on bel-3 or IxB-y , the two regulators that interact most strongly with p50 itself ( Franzoso et al .
1992 ; Inoue et al .
1992 ; Liou et al .
1992 ; Wulezyn et al .
1992 ) .
IxB- « protein levels are also regulated by p65-dependent changes in IxB mRNA .
We have shown here that retrovirus-directed expression of murine p65 can cause at least a sevenfold increase in IxB- « mRNA in transfected 293 cells .
Nuclear run-on studies of RNA from NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that most of the effect arises from increased transcription ( Fig .
6 ) .
Although we can not rule out a small contribution from post-transcrip-tional events , the simplest explanation for our findings involves the presence of kB sequences in the IxB- « pro-moter .
These sequences could bind ( p65 ) , , p50/p65 , or p65 complexed with another rel-related protein .
Two recent findings are consistent with this hypothesis .
First , we have demonstrated that ( p65 ) , can function as a transcriptional activator in vitro [ Fujita et al .
1992 ) .
Second , R. de Martin and F. Bach ( pers .
comm . )
have sequenced the promoter region of a porcine genomic locus that encodes a structural and functional homolog of IxB- « ; this promoter contains two kB sites that are functional in EMSA assays .
Increased transcription of IxB- « is probably a physiologic response that can control increases in p65 or NF- « B beyond those that can be accommodated by protein stabilization .
NFB p65 up-regulates IB Figure 6 .
Nuclear run-on RNAs from Rel- and IxB-expressing cells .
Retrovirus stocks transducing the genes indicated at the top ( Virus ) were used to infect NIH-3T3 cells .
Thirty-six hours after infection , *°P-labeled nuclear run-on RNA was prepared from each population of infected cells and hybridized to slot-biotted plasmids containing the cDNAs indicated at the left ( see Materials and methods } .
The asterisk ( * } indicates the increased 7 IxB- « transcription in p65-expressing cells .
Localization The fluorescence data on p65 subcellular localization that we have presented here differ from the results of Beg et al .
( 1992 ) and Zabel et al .
( 1993 ) , who found that overexpressed p65 localized to the nucleus .
At least three experimental details distinguish our work from theirs .
First , we used wild-type p65 and IkB-a detected with rabbit sera specific to them , not proteins amino-termi-nally modified with an influenza virus HA epitope detected with an epitope-specific monoclonal antibody .
Although the epitope-tagged proteins are largely similar in in vitro function to their normal counterparts , it is sometimes difficult to be certain that their in vivo behavior is identical .
To rule out this possibility , we have also carried out coinfection experiments similar to those shown in Figure 8 using viruses that encode wild-type p50 and p65 .
Detection with p50-specific antiserum revealed a population of cells expressing cytoplasmic p50 , which is not seen in cells transduced by p50 virus alone [ data not shown ) .
Second , the other studies were carried out using vectors containing a cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter that , in our hands , yields expression levels at least 10-fold higher than the retrovirus-based constructs that we have employed .
This partly results from the presence of « B sites in the CMV promoter itself .
Expressed proteins may therefore up-regulate their own synthesis .
A third potential explanation involves the cell types studied .
Some studies ( Beg et al .
1992 ) were carried out in COS cells that can amplify the transfected constructs , whereas our investigation employed renal carcinoma , pre-B , and B-lymphoid cells without the ability to am-plify .
It is our belief that the last two differences are probably the source of the discrepancy .
We suspect that in our experiments , the amount of p65 does not exceed the capacity of a cell to respond by synthesis of an equi-molar amount of IxB- « .

| Immunolocalization of p65 and p65A in NIH-3T3 cells .
{ A ) A phase photomicrograph of cells infected with Moloney MuLV ( helper ) virus alone [ 60 % objective } .
( B ) A fluorescence micrograph of the cells seen in A .
This sample was stained with p65-specific primary antibody { 1 : 300 dilution } and secondary rhodaminated donkey antirabbit serum { 1 : 200 dilution } , and was then photographed under the conditions used to identify the cells shown in C and D. ( C ) NIH-3T3 cells infected with the p65-transducing retroviral construct pGD-p65-34 were stained with p65-specific serum and photographed ( 60 % objective ] under conditions identical to those employed in B .
Greater than 50 % of the cells in this sample expressed detectable p65 { all cytoplasmic ) .
( D ) NIH-3T3 cells infected with the p65-transducing retroviral construct pGD-p65-A4 were stained with p65-specific serum and photographed [ 60 % objective } under conditions identical to those employed in B .
Greater than 30 % of the cells in this sample expressed detectable p65A , all with a mixture of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining .
ably such an excess of p65 that some or most of it is free from IkB-a and is therefore transported to the nucleus .
It seems unlikely that cells can make such an excess of p65 from their endogenous gene that it would overwhelm the IxB response system .
In this regard it is probably significant that transfection of a plasmid containing the genomic p65 promoter and natural exons causes increases in p65 and IxB-a « similar to those with retroviral constructs ( W. Sha , M. Scott , and D. Baltimore , unpubl . } .
The p65A splice variant both fails to stabilize IxB- « and fails to induce elevated transcription of IxB- « mRNA , properties that likely cause its localization to the nucleus .
It has recently been reported that p65A interacts only weakly with IxB- « , possibly because the splice variant has little ability to dimerize with itself or 1272 GENES & DEVELOPMENT other Rel variants { Beg et al , 1992 ) .
Thus , it may be the affinity of IkB-a for its full-length p65 target that stabilizes the inhibitor protein ( Ganchi et al .
1992 ) .
Such high-affinity binding could mask a site of interaction with a proteolytic system or could be the signal for a modification of IkB-a that makes it insensitive to a proteolytic system .
How these properties relate to the transforming potential of p65A ( Narayanan et al .
1992 ) remains to be determined .
Materials and methods Viruses and cells p65 virus inserts were prepared by PCR using as template the murine p65-5 cDNA clone { Nolan et al .
1991 ) .
One microgram Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press NFB p65 up-regulates IB of template DNA was amplified for 10 cycles under conditions including 10 % DMSO and 4 mm MgCl , described by the manufacturer of Taq polymerase ( Stratagene ) to yield a 1.6-kb product with the following structure : Sall-EcoRl-Kozak-p65-EcoRI-Clal .
After gel isolation , this product was inserted into the pGD retroviral vector ( Daley et al .
1990 ) at its Xhol and Clal sites , removing the neomycin-resistance cassette from the vi-tus .
Three independent clones { [ pGD-p65-28 , pGD-p65-34 , and pGD-p65-37 ) were identified ; all yielded the same increase in IxB- « levels described in the text .
A p65A mutation , deleting amino acids EDIEVYFTGP from the murine cDNA , was introduced using a 30-base oligonucleotide to prime second-strand synthesis of uracil-substituted pBSK-p65-5 phagemid DNA ( Ausubel et al .
1989 ) .
A clone containing the p65SA mutation was identified by DNA sequencing .
The Sphl-BsiWI fragment carrying this deletion was inserted into the pGD-p65-34 retroviral construct .
Clones pGD-p65A-4 and pGD-p65A-11 were selected on the basis of SphI , BsiWI , and Sacl-EcoRI digestion ( the last yielding a 228-bp fragment 30 bp shorter than wild type ) for further characterization .
The human IkB-a ( MAD-3 ) cDNA was amplified under the conditions described above , using 51-mer and 48-mer primers to generate a BamHI-EcoRI-IxB-o-EcoRI-Sall product .
This gel-isolated product was ligated to a modified pGD vector generated by Xhol digestion of the parent plasmid , followed by addition of a Bell linker to the blunted site .

( A ) A phase photomicrograph of cells coinfected with virus stocks transmitting p50 and p65 ( 60 % objective ) .
Cells were simultaneously stained with rabbit anti-p65 serum and a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the influenza virus HA epitope .
These antibodies were detected with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit serum and rhodaminated donkey anti-mouse serum as shown in B and C. ( B ) A photomicrograph of the same field of cells , using barrier filters to show green fluorescence ( p65 ) .
Only the cell at the upper left exhibits cytoplasmic p65 protein .
{ C ) A photomicrograph of the same cells seen in A and B , this time using barrier filters specific for red fluorescence ( p50/flu } .
The cell at the lower right , containing only endogenous p65 , shows a predominantly nuclear pattern of staining for p50 .
The cell at the upper left contains both retrovirally expressed p50 and p65 ; here , the p50 fluorescence is cytoplasmic .
cloning vector [ pGDB ) so generated was digested with Bcell and Sall to allow insertion of the corresponding MAD-3 cDNA .
Retroviral constructs encoding murine bel-3 and influenza HA epitope-tagged or wild-type murine p50 were also prepared and are described elsewhere { Nolan et al .
1993 ) .
Virus stocks and virus-producing cells were prepared by the method of W. Pear , G. Nolan , M. Scott , and D. Baltimore { in prep . )
using pGD-p65 , p65 , or IxB-a constructs and a replica-tion-competent helper virus clone pZAP ( Goff et al .
1982 ) .
In cocultivation experiments , 70Z/3 or WEHI 231 cells in RPMI ) were added to the adherent producer cell culture .
Twenty-four hours thereafter , the medium containing nonadherent cells was aspirated and lysates for Western blotting were prepared as described below .
Protein immunoblotting Lysates of transfected 293 cells or infected lymphoid cells were prepared at either 48 hr or at the times indicated after the addition of the p65 or IxB- « DNAs as calcium phosphate precipi-tates .
Cells were washed once with cold calcium free PBS and scraped from the plates in RIPA buffer [ 25 mm Tris-Cl at pH 7.4 , 0.5 % Triton X-100 , 0.5 % deoxycholate , 0.1 % SDS , 0.5 mm EDTA , 150 mm NaCl , 1 mm PMSF , 10 ug/ml aprotinin ( Sigma ) ] , 1.0 ml/100-mm plate of cells .

cation in an Eppendorf centrifuge ( 140008 for 10 min } , 5-10 pl of each boiled lysate was applied to 10 % polyacrylamide-SDS gels , electrophoresed , and transferred to supported nitrocellulose .
Rabbit sera specific to murine p65 were obtained after immunization with full-length protein derived from a baculovirus expression construct ( Fujita et al .
1992 ) .
The serum was used at a dilution of 1 : 1000 on immunoblots .
Affinity-purified antibodies specific to IkB-a were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase/IkB- « fusion protein ( Liou et al .
1992 ) and passing the immune sera over an Affigel 15 matrix [ Bio-Rad ] to which IxB- « fusion protein had been coupled as per the manufacturer 's instructions .
Antibody bound to the column was eluted as specified ( Harlow and Lane 1988 ) and used at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 pg/ml .
An alkaline phosphatase-cou-pled donkey anti-rabbit preparation ( Jackson Immunoresearch ] } was used to detect bound primary antibody in transfected cells .
In vivo protein labeling 293 cells seeded in 60 mm plates at 2.5 x 10° cells per plate were transfected with 5 pg of retroviral DNA per plate and incubated 48 hr before labeling .
After a 30-min period of starvation in methionine-free Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 5 % dialyzed fetal calf serum , fresh labeling medium with [ °°S ) methionine ( Amersham , 800 Ci/mmole , 200 wCi/ml ) was added for 30 min .
At the end of labeling , radioactive medium was aspirated and replaced with standard DMEM/10 % FCS { time O0 ) .
Lysates from the subsequent time points were prepared as described above and frozen at -70°C before immunoprecipitation .
Bicinchoninate assays { Pierce ) revealed less than twofold differences among the protein concentrations of all lysates .
Each lysate was precleared by the addition of 5 wl of preimmune rabbit serum for 30 min on ice ; this serum was then collected on a 20-pl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose 4B ( Pharmacia ) for 30 min .
To precipitate p65 from the precleared lysates of cells transfected with pGD-p65 , 5 pul of specific serum was added .
After incubation on ice for 60 min , another 20-pl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose { precoated with a cold lysate from untransfected 293 cells ) was added for 30 min .
The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice in RIPA buffer , twice in high salt buffer ( 1 % Triton X-100 , 0.5 m NaCl , 20 mm Tris-Cl at pH 7.6 ) , and twice in low salt buffer ( 1 % Triton X-100 , 10 mm NaCl , 20 mm Tris-Cl at pH 7.6 ) .
After the last wash , each pellet was resuspended in 30 pl of protein sample buffer and boiled for 5 min .
Five microliters of each sample was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography .
A similar protocol was used to precipitate IxB- « protein from cells transfected with either the p65 or IxB- « expression constructs .
Instead of whole sera , affinity-purified antibody [ 5 pg per lysate ) was used .
As an additional demonstration of specificity , 5 ug of affinity-purified antibody to IkB-a was preincu-bated with 50 ug of fusion protein for 30 min on ice and then added to precleared lysates and processed as described above .
This preincubation eliminated the 38-kD-labeled band precipitated from either p65 or ( IxB-a « } -transfected cells { not shown ) .
Immunofluorescence Virus stocks transducing the p50 , p65 , and p65A genomes were prepared by transient transfection of 293 cells as described above and used to infect NIH-3T3 cells .
3T3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at 10 % cells/well in 24-well plates .
The cells were exposed , 24-36 hr later , to the indicated viruses in 4 ug/ml of Polybrene for 3 hr .
For mixed infections , equal vol- 1274 GENES & DEVELOPMENT umes of viral supernatants from 293 cells singly transfected with p50 or p65 constructs were added to the plate of 3T3 cells .
Cells were then refed with DMEM/10 % calf serum and incubated for 36-48 hr .
( For some experiments , cells were infected at the indicated density in 35-mm plastic dishes , incubated for 24-48 hr , and seeded onto coverslips for staining 1 day thereaf-ter . ]
After washing in PBS , coverslips were fixed in PBS/4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , quenched with 50 mm glycine ( pH 8.0 ) in PBS for 10 min , and permeabilized with 1 % Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min .
Cells remaining on the coverslips were then blocked in a solution of PBS , 5 % normal donkey serum , and 1 mg/ml of BSA for 60 min .
Primary rabbit antiserum specific to p65 was diluted 1 : 300 in blocking solution and added to the coverslips for 45 min .
The coverslips were subsequently washed for 4-12 hr in three or four changes of PBS and reblocked for 30 min .
Secondary antibody ( rhodaminated donkey antitab-bit Fab , ; Jackson Immunoresearch ) diluted 1 : 200 , as described above , was added for 30-45 min and washed away in PBS { two or three changes ) for 1-3 hr before inversion and mounting on glass slides .
Cells were visualized and photographed using a Nikon fluorescence microscope with a 60 % objective .
RNA isolations and hybridizations 293 cells [ 10 ' cells/150-mm plate ) were transfected with p65 , p65A , or empty vector { [ pGD ) retroviral DNAs and incubated at 37°C for 48 hr .
After lysis in an NP-40-containing solution as per standard procedures { Ausubel et al .
1989 ) , total cytoplasmic RNAs obtained from each population of transfected cells were applied to an oligo ( dT } -cellulose column .
Samples ( 2.5 ug ) of each poly { A ) -containing RNA were electrophoresed through formaldehyde-agarose gels , transferred to nitrocellulose , and hybridized to **P-labeled probes derived from gel-isolated p65 and MAD-3 cDNAs .
Probe bound to each filter was detected by exposure to XAR film and quantitated by using a PhosphorIm-ager [ Molecular Dynamics ) .
The filters were stripped and rehy-bridized to an actin probe , and the process was repeated to demonstrate equal loading of RNA in each lane .
Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described ( Green-berg and Ziff 1984 ) using nuclei isolated from three 150-mm plates of NIH-3T3 cells , 36 hr after infection , with the indicated virus stocks prepared as described above .
Plasmids ( 7.5 pg ) encoding p50 { Ghosh et al .
1990 } , p65A { above ) , c-rel ( Bull et al .
1990 } , human p100 ( Schmid et al .
