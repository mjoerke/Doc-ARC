1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D , Receptor RNA : Expression in Hematopoietic Cells By Masahiro Kizaki , Anthony W. Norman , June E. Bishop , Chi-Whei Lin , Amitabha Karmakar , and H. Phillip Koeffler 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D , [ 1,25 ( OH } ) , D , ] induces differentiation and inhibits proliferation of myeloid leukemic cells from various lines and patients ; these effects are probably mediated through the 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor .
Little is known of expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA in hematopoietic cells .
We examined the expression and modulation of expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; receptor RNA in various proliferating and nonproliferating hematopoietic cells .
Constitutive expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA was detected in various kinds of hematopoietic cells , including macrophages and activated T lymphocytes , as well as in cell lines KG-1 ( { myelo-blasts } , HL-60 { promyelocytes ] , ML-3 ( { myelomonoblasts ) , U937 , THP-1 ( monoblasts ) , K562 ( erythroblasts ) , and S-LB1 ( HTLV-1-transfected T lymphocytes ) .
Receptor transcripts were 4.6 kilobases ( kb ) , and no variant sizes were observed .
All cell lines examined in this group also expressed 1,25 ( OH ) } , D , receptors .
Most B lymphocyte lines expressed negligible levels of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA and protein ; however ; analysis of a lymphoid/myeloid somatic hybrid suggested that suppression of expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA in B lymphocytes may be a dominant character-istic .
HL-60 cells were cultured with 10~ ' mol/L 1,25 ( OH ) , D , for 24 to 72 hours , and levels of expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , TAMIN D , IS A SECOSTEROID ; sequential hydrox- ylation in the liver and kidney converts it to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , [ 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ] , which is the active form , principally involved in calcium homeostasis . ''
The 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; facilitates calcium absorption from the in-testine , acts to mobilize calcium from bone , and stimulates renal reabsorption of calcium .
Studies suggest that this active metabolite may also play an important role as an immunohematopoietic regulatory hormone . ''
The 1,25 ( OH ) , D , can induce cells from both the murine myeloid leukemia line ( M-1 ) ° and the human promyelocytic leukemia line ( HL-60 ) '' * to differentiate to monocyte/macrophage-like cells .
We previously suggested that differentiation induced by 1,25 ( OH ) , D , is mediated through the intracellular 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor .
The receptor is an intracellular polypeptide that selectively binds 1,25 ( OH ) , D , with high From the Division of Hematology-Oncology , Center for Health Sciences and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , UCLA School of Medi-cine , Los Angeles ; and Division of Biomedical Sciences and Department of Biochemistry , University of California , Riverside , CA .

0006-4971/91/7706-0023 $ 3.00/0 1238 receptor and its RNA were examined .
Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand .
Levels of occupied 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor protein increased in these HL-60 cells ; but the total number of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors decreased about 50 % at 24 hours and returned toward normal at 72 hours .
Steady-state levels of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA were not affected by terminal differentiation of HL-60 toward either granulocytes or macrophages .
Nondividing macrophages from normal individuals also expressed 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA .
In contrast , nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals did not express 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA ; with stimulation of proliferation of these cells , accumulation of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA increased markedly .
Half-life ( t % ) of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA in T lymphocytes was short ( 1 hour ) as determined by measuring decay of the message after addition of actinomycin D. Consistent with this short t % , accumulation of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA increased in cells as their protein synthesis was inhibited .
Further studies are required to understand the physiologic role of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors in myeloid cells and proliferating T lymphocytes .

1242 were cultured with the ligand , we examined occupied and unoccupied 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , receptors in HL-60 cells after different lengths of exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ( Fig 2B ) ; 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ( 10~ ' mol/L ) resulted in an increase in the level of occupied 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , receptors during the 72-hour culture .
This increase in occupied receptors was accompanied by a decrease in unoccupied 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors .
The total number of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors ( occupied plus unoccupied ) was down regulated about 50 % at 24 hours and then began to return toward basal levels at 72 hours .
Nondividing macrophages express 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , receptor RNA , and RNA levels do not change after exposure to either TNF-a or LT. - Human macrophages are nondividing cells .
Both TNF-a and LT are capable of activating macrophages .
We showed that macrophages constitutively expressed 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA and exposure to either TNF-a ( 10° U/mL ) or LT ( 10° U/mL ) for 8 hours did not change levels of expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA ( Fig 3A ) .
These cytokines did stimulate accumulation of M-CSF RNA ( data not shown ) .
Macrophages had very little °H-thymidine incorporation as compared with actively dividing cells ( HL-60 ) and levels of °H-thymidine incorporation did not change during exposure to either TNF- « or LT ( Fig 3B ) .
Expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA parallels cellular proliferation in lymphocytes .
- Most peripheral blood lymphocytes are in the resting stage in the peripheral blood .
Many can be stimulated to proliferate after exposure to a mito-gen. Levels of expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA and synthesis of DNA as measured by ' H-thymidine incorporation were examined in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by 0.5 % phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) for different durations ( 0 to 72 hours ) .
' H-Thymidine incorporation increased in a time-dependent fashion ; after exposure to PHA for 24 hours , it was 10.5-fold above baseline ; at 48 and 72 hours , it was 36.5- and 50-fold greater , respectively , as compared with the unstimulated lymphocytes ( Fig 4B ) .
Resting lymphocytes expressed very low levels of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA .
Levels increased fivefold after 24 hours and greater than sixfold after 48 and 72 hours of exposure to PHA ( Fig 4A ) .
Half-life of steady-state 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA is short .
We examined the stability of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , receptor RNA , using S-LB1 T lymphocytes .
These cells were cultured with actinomycin D ( 5 pg/mL ) for different durations ( 0 to 8 hours ) .
RNA samples from these cells were analyzed for levels of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA ( Fig 5A , top panel ) .
Figure 5B summarizes the densitometry readings of the autoradiogram of the Northern blot shown in Fig 5A .
The half-life ( t ) of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA was approximately 1 hour .
Inhibition of protein synthesis increases expression of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; receptor RNA .
- Certain RNA species with short t % are stabilized by CHX , a protein synthesis inhibi-tor . ''
We analyzed the role of protein synthesis in regulation of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA accumulation .
S-LB1 ( T lymphocytes ) and Lu-CSF-1 ( lung adenocarcinoma cells ) were exposed to CHX ( 20 ug/mL ) for 4 hours ( Fig 6 ) .
CHX increased accumulation of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , receptor RNA in KIZAKI ET AL S-LB1 cells by threefold and in Lu-CSF-1 cells by 20-fold as compared with unstimulated , matched control samples .
DISCUSSION 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; is the physiologically important secosteroid that mediates calcium resorption of bone and intestinal calcium absorption . ''
It also has effects on hematopoiesis and the immune system . '
1,25 ( OH ) , D , induces terminal differentiation of a variety of myeloid leukemic cells from patients and cell lines as well as normal committed myeloid stem cells . ''
It decreases synthesis of immunoglobulins by B lymphocytes '' and decreases synthesis of lymphokines by T lymphocytes . ''
These effects of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , are probably mediated directly or indirectly by initial ligand binding to intracellular 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor . ''
The putative DNA-binding region of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor has strong homolo-gies to the DNA-binding domains of all the other steroid hormone receptors and with the v-erbA oncogene . ''
This suggests that the 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor belongs to the same supergene family with the other classic steroid hormone receptors .
The similarity of structure of the steroid family of receptor genes suggests a commonality in their mechanism of function .
Except for B-lymphocyte lines , all of the actively proliferating hematopoietic cells we examined expressed 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA and protein .
The 4.6-kb size of a single RNA transcript was similar to that reported for a human breast cancer cell line and a human intestinal cell line . ''
We showed that the steady-state levels of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , receptor RNA were not modulated by exposure to high concentrations of the ligand for 24 to 72 hours .
Similarly , glucocorticoid had no effect on the levels of RNA coding for the glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes . ''
Our 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor-binding assays showed that the number of occupied 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors was increased and the number of unoccupied receptors was decreased by culture with the ligand .
The total number of receptors decreased about 50 % at 24 hours and then began to return toward baseline at 72 hours of culture with 1,25 ( OH ) , D , .
These RNA and receptor data suggest that partial regulation of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor levels occur posttranscription-ally without alterations in cellular levels of transcripts coding for 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors .
In previous studies , vitamin D , metabolites upregulated the number of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors in a porcine kidney cell line ( LLC-PK1 ) . ''
Recently , investigators using an antibody against the 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , receptor showed that 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors increased at 12 hours and returned toward baseline at 48 and 72 hours when HL-60 cells were cultured with 1,25 ( OH ) , D , . ''
This discrepancy between our data and theirs is unclear .
We used 50-fold more ligand ( 10~ ' mol/L ) ; this concentration induces maximum differentiation without cytotoxicity .
Furthermore , we measured receptor numbers by their ability to bind to ligand as compared with immunoprecipitation of the receptors .
These differences in technique may explain differences in results at 24 hours of exposure to ligand .
Our later time points ( 72 hours of exposure to ligand ) are not divergent . ''

Results are the mean + SE of cultures , each performed in triplicate .
cytes ( presumably T lymphocytes ) correlated with their proliferative status .
No detectable 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA was found in nonproliferating lymphocytes harvested from the peripheral blood , but 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor transcripts became prominent after 24-hour exposure to PHA .
This paralleled initiation of proliferation of the cells .

Panel A : T lymphocytes ( S-LB1 ) were exposed for various durations ( 0 to 8 hours ) to actinomycin D ( 5 g/mL ) , and cytoplasmic RNA of these cells was sequentially hybridized with P-labeled 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors cDNA ( 4.6-kb bands , top panel ) or B-actin cDNA ( 2.1-kb bands , bottom panels ) as described in the Materials and Methods section .
The t ?
of the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D , receptor was determined by the decay of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA levels .
Panel B : Diagram of autoradiogram shown in Fig 6A as quantitated by densitometry using the control sample ( no actinomycin D ) as 100 % accumulation of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA .
1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor RNA is a dominant feature .
Perhaps B lymphocytes express a trans-acting dominant repressor of transcription of the 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor gene .
In contrast to lymphocytes , nondividing , terminally differentiated HL-60 cells and normal macrophages expressed RNA coding for 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors .
HL-60 cells were cultured with either RA or DMSO and differentiated to granulocytes or cultured with either TPA or 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; and differentiated to macrophages ( data not shown ) .
In either case , the cells lost proliferative capacity .
In addition , human macrophages were not dividing , as reflected by their low °*H-thymidine incorporation in our experiments ; never-theless , these cells expressed abundant 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor transcripts .
Further studies have shown that activated monocytes express the 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptor . ''
We previ- just & & A RELATIVE INTENSITY ( % ) w & 4.0 - 6.0 - 8.0 TIME ( brs ) ously showed that macrophages activated by y-interferon ( y-IFN ) can synthesize 1,25 ( OH ) , D , and their synthesis of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , can be controlled by levels of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , in the culture media ' '' ; in addition , we showed that 1,25 ( OH ) , D , can control levels of production of y-IFN and other cytokines produced by T lymphocytes . ''
From these findings , we hypothesized that macrophages and activated T lymphocytes might interact in a paracrine fashion using 1,25 ( OH ) , D , and y-IFN as signals . ''
Our present data on RNA expression of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , receptors suggest that the proposed interaction is possible .
