STAT3 Is a Serine Kinase Target in T Lymphocytes INTERLEUKIN 2 AND T CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALS CONVERGE UPON SERINE 727* Julian Ng and Doreen Cantrell } ( Received for publication , June 3 , 1997 ) From the Lymphocyte Activation Laboratory , Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories , 44 , Lincoln 's Inn Fields , London WCZA 3PX , United Kingdom Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 3 and 5 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) .
We now show that IL-2 regulation of STAT3 proteins in T cells is a complex response involving activation of two forms of STAT3 : 90-kDa STAT3 « and an 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3RB .
The phosphorylation of STAT proteins on serine residues is also required for competent STAT transcription .
A critical serine phosphorylation site in STAT3 « is at position 727 .
In this study we have produced an antisera specific for STAT3a « proteins phosphorylated on serine 727 and used this to monitor the phosphorylation of this residue during T lymphocyte activation .
Our results show that phosphorylation of STAT3 « on serine 727 is not constitutive in quiescent T cells but can be induced by the cytokine IL-2 .
Interestingly , triggering of the T cell antigen receptor complex or activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters also induces phosphorylation of serine 727 but without simultaneously inducing STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding .
Hence , the present results show that STAT3 serine phosphorylation can be regulated independently of the tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule .
IL-2 and T cell antigen receptor complex induction of STAT3 « @ serine 727 phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of the MEK/ERK pathway .
Previous studies have identified H-7-sensitive kinase pathways that regulate STAT3 DNA binding .
We show that H-7-sensitive pathways regulate STAT3 DNA binding in T cells .
Nevertheless , we show that H-7-sensitive kinases do not regulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727 .
These results thus show that STAT3 proteins are targets for multiple kinase pathways in T cells and can integrate signals from both cytokine receptors and antigen receptors .
The cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) '' controls G ; -S phase pro-gression , T cell clonal expansion , and functional differentiation ( 1 ) .
High affinity IL-2 receptors trigger activation of tyrosine kinases notably the Janus kinases ( JAKs ) 1 and 3 ( 2 , 3 ) and p56 '' ** ( 4 ) .
IL-2 also regulates the activity of p21 '' ( 5 ) , the kinases Raf-1 ( 6 ) , and ERK ( 7 , 8 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 9-11 ) , and p7O S6 kinase ( 12-14 ) .

24542 IL-2-activated transcription factors include members of the STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) family : STAT3 and STATS5 ( 15-19 ) .
STAT activation involves tyrosine phosphorylation which allows for Sre homology ( SH ) 2 domain-mediated homodimerization or heterodimerization .
Activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs then translocate to the nucleus to form sequence-specific DNA binding complexes and enable cytokine-mediated gene transcription ( reviewed in Ref .
20 ) .
Serine kinases are critical for STAT activation and can regulate STAT DNA binding or transcriptional activity ( 21-26 ) .
In reconstitution experiments , it has been recently shown that for STATA to elicit IFN-y-mediated antigrowth activity , the serine phosphorylation site ( Ser-727 ) is required ( 27 ) .
We have also recently shown that IL-2 regulation of STATS is mediated by both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase pathways ( 28 ) .
STAT5 serine phosphorylation in T cells is regulated by an as yet uncharacterized kinase whose activity is required for STATS transcriptional activity .
IL-2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of STAT3 .
The phosphorylation of serine 727 in the STAT3 carboxyl terminus is important for STAT3 transcriptional function , but neither has there been any characterization of STAT3 serine phosphorylation nor any study of the identity of STAT3 serine kinases in T cells .
Recent debates have focused particularly on the role of MEK/ERK kinase pathways in STAT activation ( 29 ) .
However , the identity of the STAT3 serine 727 kinase has not been fully resolved in any cellular system .
This site forms an in vitro substrate for the MAP kinase ERKs which raised the possibility that STAT3 integrates signals from the MAP kinases .
This hypothesis has not been fully explored in vivo , in particular , for certain cell systems phosphorylation of serine 727 is constitutive and in others , subject to regulation by extracellular stimuli ( 25 ) .
Herein we present evidence that IL-2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of two different forms of STAT3 : 90-kDa STAT3a « and 83-kDa STAT3R .
IL-2 also induces serine phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3a via a MEK/ERK pathway .
The present data also show that STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation can be independently regulated : activation of MAP kinases by phorbol esters or T cell antigen receptor cross-linking induces phosphorylation of STAT3a on serine 727 without concurrently inducing STAT3 DNA binding or tyrosine phosphorylation .
The phosphorylation of serine 727 is not obligatory for DNA binding or tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 .
Nevertheless , we find a H-7-sensitive kinase pathway that does not regulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3a is able to modulate STAT3 DNA binding .
These data collectively indicate the role of multiple T cell signaling pathways in mediating differential control over STAT activation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-Kit225 cells ( 80 ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10 % fetal calf serum and 1 nM recombinant IL-2 ( Eurocetus ) .

Cells were quiesced by washing three times in RPMI 1640 , and replacing in RPMI 1640 with 10 % serum in the absence of IL-2 for 48- 72 h. The inhibitors H-7 , - 1- ( G-isoquinolinylsulfonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine ( Sigma ) , and PDO098059 ( a gift of L. O'Neill , Trinity College , Dublin ) were preincubated with cells in RPMI 1640 for 30 min prior to cytokine stimulation .
Recombinant IL-2 ( 1 nM ) , interferon a ( 1000 units/m ! 1 ) , or phorbol 12,18-dibutyrate ( 50 ng/ml ) was incubated at indicated times .
Interferon a ( IFNa ) was a gift from I. Kerr .
Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ( PDBu ) was from Calbiochem .
Affinity Purification of DNA and Proteins-Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis of approximately 10-20 x 10° cells/ml in a lysis buffer comprised of 50 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8.0 , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 150 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 10 mM sodium fluoride , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM Na , VO , ; , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] !
fluoride , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 ug/ml aprotinin , 1 ug/ml leupeptin , 1 ug/ml chymostatin .
The oligonucleotide sequence used was derived from the high-affinity SIE of the c-fos gene ( SIEM6 ? 7 ) GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC .
DNA-binding proteins were isolated from extracts of approximately 15 X 10° cells in the above buffer by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with 1 ug of double-stranded , 5'-biotinylated oligonucleotide coupled to 30 ul of a 50 % suspension of streptavidin-agarose ( Sigma ) .
For affinity purification of proteins binding to the phosphopeptide IFNyR Y440P , the phosphotyrosylpeptide TSFGYD-KPH was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 ( Bio-Rad ) at 5 mg/ml , and 30 ul were used to purify binding proteins from 1 ml of cell lysate .
Binding was at 4 °C for 1 h , and complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer prior to elution by boiling in reducing sample buffer .
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 % acrylamide , 0.2 % bis gels , and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Millipore ) .
Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine ( 4G10 and PY20 ; 1 ug/ml each ; Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and Transduction Laboratories , re-spectively ) or antibodies against STAT proteins ; STATS5 , STAT3 , or STAT1 ( anti-ISGF3 ) ( Transduction Laboratories unless indicated other-wise ) .
Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the epichemilumi-nescence Western blotting system ( Amersham ) .
For the analysis of STAT8 @ B immunoreactivity on Western blot analyses , the following antibodies were used : amino-terminal ( residues 1-175 ) raised anti-STAT3 N-T fusion protein , carboxyl-terminal ( residues 750-769 ) raised anti-STAT3 C-T peptide , and carboxyl-terminal ( residues 688-727 ) raised anti-STAT3 C-T fusion protein ( Transduction Laboratories , Santa Cruz , CA , and a gift from I. Kerr , respectively ) .
For the analysis of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis , antibodies raised to the consensus tyrosine phosphorylation motif were used ( residues 701-709 ) ; either using a tyrosine phosphopeptide ( a-Py STAT3 ) or the equivalent non-phosphorylated peptide ( a-STAT3 control ) .
Both antibodies were from New England Biolabs .
Generation of Phosphoserine 727 STAT3 Antisera-The peptide sequence corresponding to human STAT3 at site 717-736 , TC-SNTIDLPMSPRALDSLMQ , were synthesized with serine 727 as a phosphopeptide or a control non-phosphorylated peptide .
These peptides were then coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the glutar-aldehyde coupling method .
Rabbit antisera to these serine 727 phosphopeptide were generated by standard immunization protocols .
Rabbit sera was screened for antigen reactivity by standard ELISA and Western blot analysis .
On final screening , the phosphoserine 727 antisera was used at a dilution of 1:5000 for Western analysis and at a dilution of 1:100 for immunoprecipitation studies .
Western Blot Analysis of Total Cell Lysates-Cells were lysed in the buffer used for affinity purification experiments , and proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 2.0 volumes of acetone .
Proteins isolated from 1 to 3 X 10° cells were separated by SDS-PAGE using the following gel conditions : for STATS5 , STAT3 , Sos , and Raf-1 analysis , 7.5 % acrylamide , 0.2 % bisacrylamide gels and 15 % acrylamide , 0.075 % bisacrylamide for MAP kinase analysis .

IL-2 induces DNA binding of two distinct forms of STAT3 .
A , IL-2-deprived peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts were left untreated or stimulated with 1 nM IL-2 for the indicated times .
Whole cell extracts were then prepared .
DNA-binding proteins were affinity purified from whole cell extracts with an agarose-coupled SIEM oligonucleotide .
Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot with STAT5 or STAT3 antibodies .
B , Kit225 cells were left untreated or treated for 10 min with IL-2 ( Zanes 4 , 8 , and 12 ) .
Cell lysates were then subjected to acetone precipitation or affinity purification with tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides or SIEM oligonu-cleotides , as indicated .
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using antisera raised to an NH , -terminal fusion protein ( Zanes 1-4 ) , distal COOH-terminal peptide ( residues 750-769 ) ( Zanes 5-8 ) , or antisera generated against a proximal COOH-terminal fusion protein ( residues 688-727 ) , of STAT3 ( lanes 9-12 ) .
The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left in kDa .
The data in Fig .
1A show that IL-2 induces DNA binding of STAT3 and STATS in peripheral blood-derived T cells .
IL-2 induced DNA binding of STAT3 and STATS is clearly discernible within 1 min of exposure to the cytokine and maximal by 10 min ( Fig .
14 ) .
Two forms , a 90-kDa and a 83-kDa form of STAT3 proteins , were seen in both Kit225 cells and peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Previous studies have not noted STAT3 heterogeneity in T cells .
However , two different STAT3 proteins of 90 and 83 kDa were detected in the IL-2 STAT-DNA complexes in both peripheral blood-derived T cells and Kit225 cells ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Two different forms of STAT3 have been described : STAT3a « and STAT3R ; STAT3R being a carboxyl-terminal truncated spliced variant of a single STAT3 gene ( 32 , 33 ) .
To further characterize the 90-and 83-kDa IL-2 induced STAT3 proteins ( termed hereafter as STAT3a « and STAT3 $ , respectively ) , antisera raised against different domains of STAT3 were used in Western blot analyses of the STAT3 proteins in total T cell lysates and in DNA binding complexes ( Fig .
1B ) .
Additionally , a tyrosine phosphopeptide comprising the tyrosine-phosphorylation site ( Tyr-440 ) of the y-interferon receptor « -chain was used to generate an affinity matrix for the purification of STAT3 from cell ex-tracts .
The data in Fig .
1B show that antisera raised against an STAT3 fusion protein and antisera generated against a fusion protein comprising residues 688-727 of STAT3 recognize two STAT3 proteins in T cell lysates and in the Tyr-440 peptide complexes .
They also recognize both IL-2-induced STAT3 proteins in SIEM DNA binding complexes .
In contrast , antisera raised against a COOH-terminal STAT3 peptide comprising residues 750-769 recognize only the 90 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 24544 LP .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is detected using phosphotyrosine ( Tyr ( P ) -705 ) STATS antibodies in IL-2 and interferon a-treated cells .
Total lysates were prepared from unstimu-lated ( Zanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ) , IL-2 ( lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) , or interferon a ( lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) -treated Kit225 cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody raised to residues ( 750-769 ) of STAT3 .
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with phosphotyrosine ( Tyr ( P ) -705 ) STAT3 ( lanes 1-3 ) , STATS ( lanes 4-6 ) , and STATS ( Zanes 7-9 ) antibodies .
kDa STAT3 and not the 83-kDa protein ( Fig .
1B ) .
The 83-kDa STAT3B protein in T cells thus corresponds to the recently described carboxyl-terminal truncated spliced variant of STAT3 ( 82 , 33 ) .
Activated and tyrosine phosphorylated STAT proteins were readily detected in STAT3 immunoprecipitates prepared from IL-2 activated T cells using anti-phosphoty-rosine antibodies raised to the tyrosine phosphorylation site of STAT3 ( Tyr-705 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
IL-2 Induces Phosphorylation of Serine 727 in STAT3o-There was a discernible reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT3a but not STAT3B isolated from IL-2-activated Kit225 cells and in IL-2 activated peripheral blood T lymphoblasts ( Fig .
34 and data not shown ) .
Both forms of STAT3 « ( termed s , slow , and f , fast ; for the different electrophoretic mobility shift properties ) can equally bind DNA upon IL-2 activation and are both tyrosine-phosphorylated .
The ability of STAT3a to undergo an electrophoretic mobility shift in response to IL-2 could reflect IL-2-regulated serine phosphorylation of STAT3 .
There is a serine phosphorylation site at residue 727 in STAT3a that is required for transcriptional activation ( 25 ) .
Generation of phosphorylation state-specific antibodies has been described previously ( 34 ) and had been shown to be successful in the analysis of site-specific phospho-rylations of a variety of proteins ( 85-37 ) , including transcription factors ( 38 ) .
Thus to circumvent radiolabeling techniques and to explore whether IL-2 is inducing the phosphorylation of STAT3a on serine 727 , we generated rabbit antisera selectively reactive to a phosphopeptide corresponding to the serine 727 site in STAT3 .
The selectivity of this antisera for the phosphorylated serine 727 STAT3 peptide compared with the nonphosphorylated peptide is shown by ELISA ( Fig .
3B ) .
The phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera could weakly immu-noprecipitate STAT3a proteins from quiescent peripheral blood-derived T cells but levels of STAT3 « immunoprecipitable with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera were increased markedly in cells lysates isolated from IL-2 stimulated T cells ( Fig .
44 ) .
The carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3B protein lacking the serine 727 site could not be immunoprecipitated with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera from either quiescent or IL-2-activated cells .
On Western blot analysis , IL-2 induced STAT3a DNA bound proteins were also reactive with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera ( Fig .
4B ) .
The reactivity of the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera with STATS3a « proteins isolated from IL-2-activated T cells could be blocked by competition with the phosphorylated serine 727 STAT3 peptide STAT3 Regulation in T Cells A Total s Lysate Kit 225 SLOT IL-2 = + 97 -| / STAT 3a s 1h ® STAT 3a f a-STAT3 STAT 38 68 1 2 B 2.000 h - # - _ STAT3 pS 727 g 1.500 - `` -o- - STATE 717-736 E tel Co =F Q & § - 1000 82 o t G -f 0.500 `` '' '' T fqn fg .

Kit225 cells were left untreated ( Zane 1 ) , or stimulated with 1 nM IL-2 for 10 min .

Antisera was then incubated at the indicated dilutions , starting at 1:100 , followed with serial 2-fold dilutions .
Horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit antisera was then incubated at 1:1000 .
Plates were subsequently washed in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 0.05 % and immunoabsorbance was detected using ABTS substrate ( Boeh-ringer Mannheim ) .
Plates were read at 405 nm after 30 min incubation .
Data shown represents two such experiments expressed as an average .
but not the nonphosphorylated peptide ( data not shown ) .
STAT3 proteins , affinity purified using the IFNyR Tyr-440 tyrosine phosphopeptide matrix were similarily analyzed for immunoreactivity with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera .
There was a low level reactivity of phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera with STAT3 proteins isolated from quiescent cells but this was markedly increased upon IL-2 stimulation ( Fig .
4C ) .
No reactivity of phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera with STAT3RB could be detected .
These data collectively show that IL-2 induces serine phosphorylation of STAT3 « on serine 727 in peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts .
Serine 727 in STAT3 « Is Regulated by the MEK/ERK Pathway in T Cells-Xenopus MAP kinase can phosphorylate STAT1 in vitro at the carboxyl terminus consensus MAPK phosphorylation site ( 25 ) .
The equivalent in vitro ERK site in STAT3 is serine 727 .
To explore directly the role of the MEK/ ERK pathway in STAT3 regulation by IL-2 we used an inhibitor of the ERK stimulatory kinase , MAP kinase kinase ( MEK ) , PDO098059 .
The specificity of PDO98059 as a MEK inhibitor has been previously described ( 89 , 40 ) .

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , followed by Western blot analysis with STAT3 antibodies .

In Western blot analysis , phosphotyrosine STAT3 antibodies were cross-reactive with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 , hence indicated as a-phosphotyrosine ( a-p¥ ) STAT .
C , whole cell extracts were prepared as above and STAT proteins were affinity purified using agarose-conjugated tyrosine phosphopeptides , as previously .
Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and followed by Western blot analysis using phosphoserine 727 STAT3 ( Zanes 1 and 2 ) or STAT3 antibodies ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
of the MEK inhibitor in T cells , we examined the phosphorylation of ERK induced by IL-2 in T cells pretreated with PD098059 .
As an additional means to monitor ERK activation in IL-2-treated cells , hyperphosphorylation of ERK substrates were also analyzed .
Cellular substrates for ERK in T cells , as in many cells , include the p21 '' effector molecule Raf-1 , and the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Sos ( 41 , 42 ) .
These proteins are both upstream regulators of the MAP kinases , but are phosphorylated by the MAP kinases through feedback signaling mechanisms .
Hyperphosphorylated ERK , Raf-1 , and Sos have reduced electrophoretic mobility when analyzed by SDS-PAGE .

Analysis of STAT3a « and STAT3 $ in DNA bound complexes ( Fig .

Effects of PDBu and the T cell antigen receptor agonist UCHT-1 on STATS .
A , Kit225 cells were untreated ( Zane 1 ) , stimulated STAT3 Regulation in T Cells MEK/ERK pathway prevents the IL-2-induced phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3 @ .
The Induction of STAT3a Phosphorylation on Serine 727 Does Not Require Tyrosine Phosphorylation of STAT3a-The phorbol ester PDBu stimulates protein kinase C and activates the ERK/MAP kinase pathway independently of IL-2 receptor activation .
If STAT3 « is regulated by MEK/ERK then one possibility is that PDBu , which activates ERK via a protein kinase C/Raf-1 pathway independent of IL-2 , could also induce the phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3a @ .
This is assuming that serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins can proceed independently of their tyrosine phosphorylation .
The data in Fig .
6A show that PDBu did not induce changes in the electrophoretic mobility of STATS but similar to IL-2 , PDBu induced changes in the electrophoretic mobility of STATS3 « but not STAT3B .
Moreover , immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of STAT3 proteins showed that PDBu induced STAT3a reactivity with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera ( Fig .
6B , panels a and b ) .
PDBu did not induce DNA binding of STAT3 probably because of the failure of phorbol esters to induce STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
6C and data not shown ) .
The PDBu data thus show that phosphorylation of STAT3a on serine 727 can occur independently of DNA binding or tyrosine phosphorylation .
Phorbol esters are pharmacological activators of the ERK pathway and to examine whether a more physiological signal for ERK activation can induce phosphorylation of STAT3 proteins in the absence of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation , we examined the effects of triggering the T cell antigen receptor complex on STAT3 .
Previous studies have shown that triggering of the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) complex does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 ( 31 ) .
However , the data in Fig .
6D show that STAT3a « proteins isolated from TCR-acti-vated T cells are reactive with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera compared with the weak reactivity seen in STAT3a @ proteins isolated from quiescent T cells .
These results show that STAT3 « can be phosphorylated on serine 727 in response to triggering the TCR complex .
This effect is prevented by pretreating T cells with the MEK inhibitor PDO98059 ; consistent with a model in which TCR regulation of the phosphorylation of serine 727 being mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway ( Fig .
6D ) .
IL-2 Induced STAT3 but Not STAT5 DNA Binding Is Regulated by a H-7 Serine Kinase Pathway-The data above show that IL-2 regulates a MEK-sensitive serine kinase that is acting on serine 727 in the COOH terminus of STAT3a @ .

Serine kinase inhibitor H-7 but not PDO98059 inhibits DNA binding of STAT3a « and STAT3B .
H-7 does not target IL-2 induced phosphorylation of serine 727 on STATS8a .
A , Kit225 cells were left untreated ( lane 1 ) or treated ( Zanes 2-7 ) with IL-2 for 10 min following preincubation with the indicated micromolar concentrations of PDO98059 ( lanes 3-6 ) or 200 um H-7 .

A low exposure is also shown to highlight the electrophoretic mobility shift of STAT3a @ , no difference in mobility shift of STATSRG was detected .
On total lysates , the phosphotyrosine ( Tyr ( P ) 705 ) STAT3 antibody is also cross-reactive with STAT5 ( indicated ) .

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antibodies .
sufficient for induction of STAT3a @ DNA binding ( Fig .
5B and 6C , respectively ) .
Although the MEK inhibitor PDO98059 inhibits STAT3a @ serine 727 phosphorylation ( Fig .
5C ) , the data 24547 in Fig .
7A show that pretreatment of T cells with the MEK inhibitor does not abrogate IL-2 induced STAT3w/B tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
7A , lane 2 versus lane 3 ) .
Thus , although the MEK pathway can control STAT3a phosphorylation on serine 727 , its activity is not required for IL-2 induced DNA binding of STAT3 « or STAT3 $ or tyrosine phosphorylation .
In certain cells , cytokine induction of STAT3 DNA binding can be regulated by a serine kinase pathway sensitive to the serine/ threonine kinase inhibitor H-7 ( 24 ) .
H-7 does not block the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in T cells ( 28 ) but the role of H-7-sensitive kinases in IL-2/STAT3 regulation in T cells had not been examined .
We considered the possibility that STAT3 could be regulated by two different serine kinases .
We therefore examined the effect of H-7 pretreatment of T cells on IL-2 regulation of STAT3 .
The data in Fig .
7B shows that IL-2 induced STAT3 @ /B DNA binding was inhibited in T cells pretreated with H-7 .
H-7 did not inhibit IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 @ /B ( Fig .
7A , lane 2 versus 7 ) .
The effect of H-7 on STAT3 DNA binding showed selectivity since this inhibitor did not prevent IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 or STATS ( Fig .
7A ) .
Nor was DNA binding of STATS5 proteins affected by H-7 ( Fig .
7B ) although as described previously , H-7 inhibits the generation of the serine-phosphorylated STAT5 p2 form as shown by the effect of H-7 on IL-2-induced electrophoretic mobility shift of STATS proteins .
( 28 ) ( Fig .
7B ) .
The inhibitor H-7 also did not prevent the formation of hyperphosphorylated STAT3 « @ in IL-2-activated cells in contrast to the effects of the MEK inhibitor PDO98059 ( Fig .
7A lane 7 versus lane 3 , respectively ) .
Concurrently , STAT3 « proteins from IL-2 activated , H-7-pretreated T cells were also reactive with phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera ( Fig .
7C ) , demonstrating that H-7 in T cells does not inhibit IL-2-induced phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3 @ .
Thus , H-7 inhibits IL-2 induction of STAT3 DNA bound complexes without preventing tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3a .
DISCUSSION The present study reveals that IL-2 activates DNA binding of two forms of STAT3 in T cells : 90-kDa STAT3 « @ and an 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated We show moreover that STAT3 proteins are both tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated in IL-2-activated T cells .
Notably , we developed a specific antibody reactive with phosphorylated serine 727 in STAT3 « and show that STAT3a is regulated by a MEK regulated pathway that is not required for STAT3 DNA binding but which specifically targets the site serine 727 required for STAT3 « maximal transcriptional activity ( 25 ) .
The present results also reveal that phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3a « is not only regulated by IL-2 but can be regulated by the TCR or phorbol esters ( Fig .
8 ) .
IL-2 activation of STAT3 concurrently induces phosphorylation on serine 727 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation .
However , STAT3 phosphorylation on serine 727 in response to TCR ligation or phorbol esters occurs without concomitant induction of tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding of STAT3 .
Accordingly , the serine and tyrosine phosphorylation pathways that target the STATs can be controlled independently by extracellular stimuli .
A continual challenge in T cell biology is to understand the mechanisms that regulate the immune specificity of T cell responses .
Phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3a is required for maximal STAT3 transcriptional activity ( 25 ) .
The ability of T cells to respond to TCR triggering by inducing phosphorylation of STAT3 on a residue that is key for STAT3 transcriptional activity reveals that in T cells there is `` crosstalk '' regulation of the STAT 's by members of the antigen receptor family .

Schematic representation of the pathways that converge to regulate STAT3 in T cells .
During T cell activation , the T cell antigen receptor activates the MEK/ERK pathway .
This phospho-rylates STAT8a @ on serine 727 .
Subsequent engagement of the IL-2 receptor results in phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 of STAT3 @ « and its SH2-mediated dimerization and induction of DNA binding .
IL-2 can also induce the MEK/ERK-mediated phosphorylation of serine 727 .
A second , unidentified , H-7-sensitive pathway can also regulate STAT3 DNA binding in IL-2-activated T cells .
activity of STAT3a @ in T cells to be linked to the immune activation status of the cells ; a link which may facilitate the immune specificity of T cell responses .
The inhibitor H-7 has been one tool with which to explore STAT serine kinases in a variety of cell systems , particularly , the regulation of STAT3 by H-7-sensitive kinases has been described .
Because of these previous experiments with H-7 we were prompted to see whether H-7 could regulate the phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3 @ .
The present study shows that IL-2-induced STAT3 DNA binding can be regulated by a H-7-sensitive pathway .
Nevertheless , the H-7-sensitive pathway does not regulate STAT3 « @ serine 727 phosphorylation .
The H-7 target is unknown but is intriguing because of the effects of H-7 on STAT3 DNA binding .
The simplest interpretation of the H-7 data is that STAT3a « integrates signals from two serine kinase pathways in T cells : a MEK-regulated pathway and a H-7-sensitive pathway .
These pathways are independent as H-7 does not prevent IL-2 activation of the MEK/ERK2 pathway ( 28 ) or the phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3 « .
H-7 , however , does inhibit IL-2-activated STAT3 DNA binding in T cells .
Conversely , the MEK/ERK2 pathway regulates phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3a « but is not necessary for IL-2 induced STAT3 DNA binding .
The regulation of both STAT3 « and DNA binding indicates that the H-7-sensitive pathway must regulate a site outside the variant carboxyl termini of the two forms of STAT3 .
It is possible that through a H-7-sensitive kinase , phosphorylation at , or close to , the DNA-binding domain increases DNA binding affinity of STAT3 proteins .
Nevertheless , it is also possible that the H-7 effect on STAT3 proteins is indirect and mediated through association with other transcription factors or co-factors ; H-7-inhibited phosphorylation of these associated factors could contribute to a loss in STAT3 DNA binding affinity .
We have shown previously that IL-2 activation of STATS5 involves the convergent action of both tyrosine and serine/ threonine kinases ( 28 ) .
The STATS serine kinase is H-7 sensitive and not regulated by MEK and can not be stimulated by activators of the MAP kinase cascade ( 28 ) .
Herein we show that the STAT3 727 serine kinase is sensitive to a MEK inhibitor and can be stimulated by receptors that activate the MEK cascade independently of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation .
The STAT3 Regulation in T Cells involvement of the MEK pathway clearly distinguishes IL-2 regulation of STAT3a and STAT5 and shows how a single cytokine working in the same cell can use distinct serine kinase pathways to regulate different STAT 's .
There has been considerable debate as to the identity of STAT serine kinases .
The present results show that regarding the identity of STAT serine kinases may reflect that cytokines can target STAT 's involving multiple and functionally different serine kinase pathways .
The MEK/ERK pathway is known to have an essential role in the activation responses of mature T cells and in thymocyte differentiation : the transition of thymocytes from double negative to double positive cells requires MEK/ERK2 activity as does positive selection of thymocytes ( 43 , 44 ) .
Despite the importance of this pathway , few MEK regulated pathways have been identified in T lymphocytes .
We now show that serine 727 , a residue critical for STAT3 function , is a substrate for the action of the MEK in T cells .
Interestingly , serine 727 in STAT3a can be phosphorylated by the MEK/ERK pathway not only in response to the cytokine IL-2 but also in response to triggering of the antigen receptor complex .
The present results demonstrate serine phosphorylation of residue 727 can occur independently of STAT3 « tyrosine phosphorylation , indicating that the regulation of STAT3 DNA binding and maximal transcriptional activity are separate processes .
These data collectively reveal the complexity of STAT regulation and show that STATs are not only targets for members of the cytokine receptor family in T cells but can also integrate diverse MAP kinase signals notably , signals from antigen receptors .
