7734-7738 , August 1993 Immunology Molecular regulation of human interleukin 2 and T-cell function by interleukin 4 EpwaArDp M. SCHWARZ , PaADMINI SALGAME , AnD BARRY R. BLOOM Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx , NY 10461 Contributed by Barry R. Bloom , May 18 , 1993 ABSTRACT _ Distinct functional T-cell subsets , differing in the patterns of lymphokines produced , regulate cell-mediated and humoral immune responses .
The two major types and their principal products , interleukin 4 and interferon y ( IL-4 and IFN-y ) , are reciprocally negatively interactive .
To analyze the molecular mechanism of IL-4-mediated suppression of cell-mediated immunity we studied its effects on expression of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and IFN-y .
IL-4 pretreatment of Jurkat cells prior to stimulation resulted in a decrease in transcription of the IL2 gene .
IL-4 suppressed IL-2 and IFN-y mRNA levels in primary human T cells , and addition of anti-CD28 antibodies relieved this suppression .
Using enhancer-reporter constructs , IL-4 specifically down-regulated the NFIL-2B element .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a DNA oligomer containing the NFIL-2B binding site indicated that IL-4 inhibited the NFIL-2B complex and that the NFIL-2B DNA binding factor is distinct from AP-1 .
These results suggest that IL-4 may regulate development and function of T-cell subsets involved in cell-mediated immunity in part by inhibiting factors required for transcription of the ZL2 gene .
Functional T-cell subsets have been defined in human and mouse cells by their surface markers and the patterns of lymphokines produced .
Type 1 CD4 ( Th1 ) and CD8 ( cyto-toxic T lymphocyte ) T cells producing interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and interferon y ( IFN-y ) serve as effector cells for cell-mediated immunity , whereas type 2 CD4 ( Th2 ) cells that regulate antibody formation and type 2 CD8 T cells that have suppressor activity produce interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) ( 1-3 ) .
IL-4 has been shown to exert immunosuppressive effects on cell-mediated immunity and resistance to Leishmania and Schistosome parasites in murine systems ( 4 , 5 ) .
CD8 T cells with mRNA for IL-4 predominate in lesions of antigen-unresponsive patients with lepromatous leprosy ( 6 ) .
Clones of such T cells suppress in vitro responses of antigen-responsive CD4 cells , and production of IL-4 appears to be a necessary condition for in vitro suppression by many ( 3 ) if not all ( 39 ) .
The present work explores the hypothesis that the suppressive effects of IL-4 result from transcriptional down-regulation of lymphokine genes functionally required by type 1 T cells to generate cell-mediated responses , particularly L2 and IFNG ( IFN-y gene ) .

RESULTS Suppression of IL2 Expression by IL-4 .
Jurkat cells have long served as a useful human T-cell model for study of transcriptional regulation of the ZL2 gene .
Stimulation with ionomycin and PMA mimics the effect of T-cell receptor-induced activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C , respectively , thereby inducing IL2 gene transcription .
When we pretreated Jurkat cells with IL-4 , an 80 % decrease in IL2 mRNA production was observed ( Fig .
1 ) .
This suppression could be attributed entirely to a decrease in the rate of IL2 gene transcription , since the half-life of the mRNA was unaffected ( Fig .
24 ) .
Of interest , addition of an antibody to CD28 , a costimulatory signal , relieved this suppression ( Fig .
1 ) .
To ascertain the biological significance of these findings with the Jurkat cell line , we measured the effect of IL-4 on steady-state mRNA levels in primary PBLs .
Northern analysis indicated that the transcriptional down-regulation of the IL2 gene by IL-4 observed in Jurkat cells faithfully reflected that in primary T cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
In addition , these experiments showed that the IFNG gene was also down-regulated by IL-4 .
A recent study in mouse ( 11 ) and the present study in human cells ( Fig .
2C ) demonstrate that a minimum of 12 hr of IL-4 pretreatment is required for suppression of IL2 mRNA levels to be manifest .
IL-4 Selectively Inhibits NFIL-2B .
Transcription of the ZL2 gene is regulated primarily through the 5 ' flanking region 326 bp upstream of the transcription start site ( 12 ) .
Since many of the binding sites for nuclear factors in this region are known ( 13-16 ) , we sought to assay these enhancer elements independently to determine if any was inhibited by IL-4 pretreatment .
One 5 ' element of the IL2 gene , termed NFIL-2B , originally defined as being protected from DNase I attack upon T-cell activation and essential to transcriptional activation of the IL2 gene by deletion analysis ( 14 ) , was of particular interest because it has been identified as the element sensitive to cyclosporin A ( 7 ) , glucocorticoids ( 17 , 18 ) , and clonal anergy ( 19 ) .
Using Jurkat cells transformed initially with a series of integrated B-galactosidase reporter constructs , we found the NFIL-2B enhancer element was reduced 50 % in transcriptional activity by IL-4 pretreatment , whereas the NF-AT and Oct-1 enhancer elements were not affected ( Fig .
3A ) .
The NFKB enhancer element was slightly inhibited by IL-4 .

USA 90 ( 1993 ) 7735 elements did not reflect the expected results based on the experiments with the endogenous ZL2 gene , we reasoned that this was due to position effects of the integrated reporters .
To establish that the IL-4 effects on the NFIL-2B element and the entire ZL2 enhancer were substantial , transient transfection assays were carried out with luciferase reporter plasmids ( Fig .
3 ) .
These experiments clearly confirmed that IL-4 pretreatment prevents transcription of the IL2 gene by inhibiting the NFIL-2B element .
The inhibition of NFIL-2B enhancer activity resulting from IL-4 pretreatment can be explained by our observation that the NFIL-2B complex is not formed in gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from cells treated with IL-4 prior to stimulation ( Fig .
4A ) .
In controls we observed that IL-4 pretreatment had no effect on the AP-1 and NF-AT complexes as assayed by gel shifts ( Figs .
4 B and C ) .
NFIL-2B Is a Transcription Factor Distinct from AP-1 .
The NFIL-2B element contains a putative AP-1 binding site , TRE ( AGAGTCA ) , and it has been demonstrated that partially purified AP-1 will bind to this site ( 20 ) .
It is also known that the IL2 gene is regulated by Fos and Jun proteins ( 21 ) .
Based on these data several groups inferred that the NFIL-2B element is merely an AP-1 site .
To clarify the issue , we analyzed the factors that bind this element in greater detail .
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the -159 to -134 region as a probe with nuclear extracts from unstimulated Jurkat cells , two complexes were observed ( Fig .
54 , lane 2 ) .
When gel shifts were performed with an oligo mutated in the two major AP-1 contact bases ( NFIL-2Bm ) , which reduces its capacity to bind AP-1 > 100-fold ( 22 ) , only the lower complex was formed ( Fig .
5A , lane 3 ) .
Since it is known that c-Jun is constitutively produced , but that c-Fos is induced upon stimulation ( 23 ) , this finding indicates that in unstimulated cells the DNA binding of the upper complex is probably due to Jun homodimers .
When gel shifts were carried out with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells stimulated by PMA and ionomycin , using the wild-type and mutant oligos , only the lower complex was formed , suggesting that the Jun homodimer complex was no longer present ( Fig .
5A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Another approach taken to discriminate different DNA binding proteins was use of a known enhancer element site of different sequence to learn if it can compete in a gel shift assay .
We used an unlabeled oligomer containing the AP-1 binding site of the human metallothionein gene as a competitor in the NFIL-2B gel shift assay ( Fig .
5A , lanes 7-13 ) .
If the only function of the NFIL-2B element were to bind AP-1 , then the unlabeled AP-1 metallothionine oligo would be expected to competitively inhibit the NFIL-2B gel shift .
Fig .
5A ( lanes 8 , 11 , and 13 ) demonstrates that the unlabeled AP-1 oligo failed to competitively inhibit the NFIL-2B gel shift in nuclear extracts from stimulated cells .

These two sets of experiments together provide compelling evidence that the DNA binding in the NFIL-2B complex is not mediated by AP-1 .
It was surprising that the NFIL-2B gel shift was generated when the unlabeled AP-1 oligo was added to extracts from unstimulated cells ( Fig .
5A , lanes 7 , 10 , and 12 ) .
This result suggested that in unstimulated cells , the NFIL-2B factor may be bound to an inhibitor that prevents it from binding DNA .
The putative inhibitor could specifically interact with the AP-1 oligo and , in so doing , allow the NFIL-2B complex to form .
The same experiments also revealed that the NFIL-2B factor is constitutively expressed but is capable of binding to DNA only after cells are stimulated .
Nuclear extracts from the IL-4-pretreated and stimulated cells yielded the same results as those from unstimulated cells , a weak NFIL-2B gel Proc .

5A , lanes 7 and 9 ) .
These results demonstrate that IL-4 pretreatment does not prevent the expression of the NFIL-2B factor but blocks some modification that enables it to bind DNA following stimulation .
As predicted by the inhibitor model , the ability of the unlabeled AP-1 oligo to generate the NFIL-2B gel shift in nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells was concentration dependent ( Fig .
5B ) .
Less than 20 ng of unlabeled oligo was insufficient to liberate NFIL-2B and > 20 ug of oligo nonspecifically inhibited the NFIL-2B gel shift .
We then tested the possibility that the inhibitor might be c-Jun .
The NFIL-2B DNA complex generated with unstimulated nuclear extracts ( Fig .
5C , lane 2 ) was dissociated and competitively inhibited by the addition of purified c-Jun homodimers ( lane 3 ) , but not 20 ug of bovine serum albumin , an irrelevant protein ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The data of the present study clearly indicate the existence of a DNA binding factor distinct from AP-1 that binds to the sequence defined by Durand et al .
( 14 ) as NFIL-2B and that is present in resting and stimulated T-cell , B-cell , and mac-rophage cell lines ( Fig .

model in which NFIL-2B in resting cells is bound to an inhibitor , most probably Jun homodimers , and is not free to bind the enhancer until c-Fos is induced by stimulation and the AP-1 heterodimer forms , or a post-translational modification releases the factor .
There are multiple additional lines of evidence consistent with our interpretation that the NFIL-2B factor is distinct from AP-1 and essential for IL2 gene regulation : ( ? )
the -159 to -151 deletion mutant , which leaves a putative AP-1 binding site intact , exhibits an 89 % loss of transcription ( 14 ) ; ( ii ) the core AP-1-like sequence of the NFIL-2B site , AGAGTCA , does not bind Jun/Fos het-erodimers ( 24 ) ; ( ii ? )

IL2 gene and binds to the NFIL-2B enhancer element is distinct from AP-1 .
It has also been found that the NF-AT and NFIL-2B elements act synergistically ( 17 ) and both elements have been reported to interact with AP-1-like factors ( 28-30 ) .
However , since the DNA binding proteins that recognized these elements are distinct from AP-1 , a model is suggested in which the NF-AT and NFIL-2B elements , both essential for IL2 transcription , may interact by binding the c-Jun and c-Fos components of AP-1 , perhaps after its phosphorylation ( 31 ) following T-cell activation , to form a transcriptional complex , similar to the original proposal for AP-1 transcriptional activation ( 32 ) .
The interaction of all three factors could best be accomplished by a loop , suggested in other systems to explain how enhancing elements situated at a distance from the transcriptional start site act to regulate transcription ( 33 , 34 ) .
The CD28 signal may relieve the IL-4-induced suppres-sion , possibly by stabilizing IL2 transcripts ( 35 ) or by compensating for the absence of the NFIL-2B complex by the CD28-induced nuclear factor , CD28RC , which binds to the site precisely adjacent to the NFIL-2B binding site ( 16 ) .
Mechanisms of peripheral tolerance-T -cell suppression and clonal anergy-appear to share many similarities .
Our findings suggest that the transcriptional regulation of the ZL2 gene by IL-4 is very similar to that recently described in anergic T cells ( 19 ) .
As in anergy , IL-4 pretreatment did not block the induction of c-fos mRNA ( data not shown ) .
Although the precise molecular mechanism by which the NFIL-2B enhancer is negatively regulated in all of these systems remains to be elucidated , our data indicate that IL-4 does not affect the expression of the NFIL-2B factor ( Fig .
5A , lane 9 ) .
Thus possible mechanisms of suppression could be through post-translational modifications , as described for other transcription factors ( 36 ) , or induction of a novel factor yet to be identified .
Overall , these results indicate that one mechanism by which IL-4 down-regulates IL-2 production is by inhibition of the transcription factor complex , NFIL-2B .
The complete role of IL-4 in regulation of T-cell subsets remains to be elucidated .
It is clear that IL-4 inhibits the expression of protective cell-mediated immunity in several infectious disease models .
Not only may IL-4 serve as a growth factor for type 2 CD4 ( Th2 ) ceils ( 37 , 38 ) , and suppress functions of type 1 CD4 ( Th1 ) cells , but it also may act to suppress the differentiation of virgin T cells to type 1 T cells by inhibiting production of IL-2 required for their expansion .
