IMMUNOBIOLOGY Selective imhibition of interleukin-4 gene expression in human T cells by aspirin Antonella Cianferoni , John T. Schroeder , Jean Kim , John W. Schmidt , Lawrence M. Lichtenstein , Steve N. Georas , and Vincenzo Casolaro Previous studies indicated that aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) can have profound immunomodulatory effects by regulating cytokine gene expression in several types of cells .
This study is the first in which concentrations of ASA in the therapeutic range were found to significantly reduce interleukin ( IL ) -4 secretion and RNA expression in freshly isolated and mitogen-primed human CD4+* T cells .
In contrast , ASA did not affect IL-13 , inter-feron-y , and IL-2 expression .
ASA inhibited IL-4 , but not IL-2 , promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ex pression in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells .
The structurally unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not affect cytokine gene expression in T cells , whereas the weak cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid was at least as effective as ASA in inhibiting IL-4 expression and promoter activity .
The inhibitory effect of ASA on IL-4 transcription was not mediated by decreased nuclear expression of the known salicylate target nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B and was accompanied by reduced binding of an inducible factor to an IL-4 promoter region upstream of , but not overlapping , the NF of activated T cells , and NF-kB-binding P1 element .
It is concluded that anti-inflammatory salicylates , by means of a previously unrecognized mechanism of action , can influence the nature of adaptive immune responses by selectively inhibiting the expression of IL-4 , a critical effector of these responses , in CD4+ T cells .

2001 ; 97 : 1742-1749 ) ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) is the oldest and most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) .
Although several other classes of NSAIDs have become available since the introduction of ASA in 1899 , this agent and structurally related salicylates still provide the mainstay of therapy for inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders .
In addition , these compounds have been shown to be effective in the management and prevention of an increasingly diverse array of noninflammatory conditions , including coronary and cerebral ischemia and gastrointestinal cancer . ''
Both the therapeutic properties of NSAIDs and their side effects have been ascribed to their ability to inhibit generation of prostaglandin ( PG ) and thromboxane by interfering with the intracellular enzyme cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) .
It is widely accepted that the anti-inflammatory actions of NSAIDs are mediated by inhibition of the inducible COX isoform COX-2 , whereas their detrimental effects on gastric mucosa viability and platelet function are due mostly to inhibition of COX-1.4 The relative effectiveness of several NSAIDs against the 2 isozymes varies considerably . ''
In particular , although ASA is a relatively effective , irreversible inhibitor of COX-1 , its effects on COX-2 activity are negligible . ''
This probably explains why higher doses of ASA are required in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases than are sufficient to inhibit PG generation in different experimental models in vitro . ''
However , the in vivo anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity of nonacetylated salicylates , which are poor overall inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2 , is almost superimposable to that of ASA or even more potent NSAIDs , such as diclofenac . ''
Indeed , given the short serum half-life of ASA ( 15 minutes ) , the serum concentra- tions of salicylic acid ( SA ) , its major nonacetylated metabolite , are better predictors of therapeutic effectiveness than the concentrations of ASA itself . ''
In the light of these observations , it has been speculated that inhibition of PG production can not fully account for the therapeutic potential of ASA and related salicylates . ''
Indeed , several studies showed that these compounds have a spectrum of biochemical and pharmacologic effects that are not related to COX inhibition and not shared with other NSAIDs .
* '' A major finding was the discovery that ASA and SA can interfere with the activation of critical transcription factors , such as nuclear factor ( NF ) B ( NF- « B ) and activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) .
`` ° On the other hand , salicylates were reported to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases and enhance interferon ( IFN ) signaling .
`` `` '' * '' '' These overall effects of salicylates are compounded by their ability to induce the release of potent anti-inflammatory mediators , such as adeno-sine and 15-epi-lipoxin A , .
* > '' * Taken together , these observations support the idea that the multiple therapeutic effects of ASA derive from its ability to regulate a network of biochemical and cellular events more complex than was initially thought .
It has long been speculated that the effectiveness of ASA in chronic inflammation , as well as in several apparently unrelated clinical conditions , might be at least partly accounted for by its effects on immune responses. ! ''
However , data on this issue are sparse and contradictory .
In particular , few studies have assessed the effects of ASA or other NSAIDs on T-cell differentiation and function .
Decreased production of immunomodulating PGs , such as prostaglandin E ; ( PGE ) , in accessory cells may account for the From the Departments of Medicine and Otolaryngology , The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD .

BLOOD , 15 MARCH 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 6 ability of ASA and other NSAIDs to bolster T helper ( Th ) 1-driven cellular immune responses . '' '' ''
ASA and ibuprofen can enhance mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation and the expression of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IFN-y , macrophage-derived IL-1f3 , tumor necrosis factor-a , and IFN- « .
`` > Conversely , by inhibiting NF- « B and perhaps other mechanisms , high concentrations of salicylates interfere with Th1-cell differentiation and effector responses . ''
`` `` This is in keeping with the idea that NF-kB activation is a preferential requirement for expression of cytokine genes in Th1 cells and macrophages .
`` 8 '' '' In this study , we examined the effect of ASA on the expression of effector cytokines in purified human CD4* T cells .
The study is the first to find that therapeutic concentrations of ASA can significantly and selectively inhibit the expression of the Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 .
This effect of ASA is not associated with reduced cell viability or detectable apoptotic changes and is apparently not due to inhibition or acetylation of COX isozymes in T cells , since it is not shared with other NSAIDs and can be reproduced in experiments using identical concentrations of the nonacetylated salicylate SA .
Our findings in purified CD4* T cells provide the first evidence that these cells may be a direct target of ASA and related compounds .
We found that inhibition of IL-4 expression by ASA and SA occurs at the transcriptional level and is due to interference with the binding of a Ca +*-inducible factor to a proximal IL-4 promoter element .
Much evidence indicates that this factor is not NF-kB and points to a previously unrecognized molecular target of ASA and structurally related compounds .
Materials and methods Cell isolation and culture Peripheral blood T cells ( PBT ) were enriched by elutriation of residual cells from unidentified healthy donors undergoing hemapheresis ( Oncology Center , Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions , Baltimore , MD ) . ''
These preparations , which were analyzed for expression of leukocyte markers with an Epics Profile II cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) , comprised an average of about 45 % CD3*CD4* cells , 20 % CD3*CD8* , 5 % CD19* , and 3 % CD14* .
CD3*CD4* cells were purified to at least 97 % by using the StemSep CD4 * T-cell enrichment cocktail ( StemCell Technologies , Vancouver , BC ) and magnetically activated cell-sorter LS* columns ( Miltenyi , Auburn , CA ) .
PBT and the Jurkat human T-cell line ( donated by Dr Jack L. Strominger , Harvard University , Boston , MA ) were cultured in complete medium consisting of 90 % RPMI 1640 ( Biofluids , Rockville , MD ) , 10 % fetal calf serum ( Summit , Ft Collins , CO ) , 2 mM GlutaMax-I ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) , and 40 ug/mL gentamicin .
Cell stimulation and cytokine detection PBT ( 2 X 105/0.5 mL ) were stimulated with A23187 and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) or murine monoclonal antibodies against human CD3 ( clone HIT3a ) and CD28 ( CD28.2 ; Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) .
Enriched PBT ( 2 X 105/mL ) were primed by 6-day incubation in complete medium containing 5 pg/mL phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ; Calbiochem ) with or without 50 ng/mL IL-4 ( R & D , Minneapolis , MN ) .
At the end of the incubation , cells were harvested , washed 3 times , and seeded in 24-well plates ( 10°/mL ) for restimulation .
ASA , SA , indomethacin ( IM ) , flurbiprofen ( FBP ) , sulfasalazine ( SSA ) , or dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) carrier ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) were added 15 minutes before stimulation .
Cytokine titers were measured in supernatants collected 18 to 20 hours after stimulation by using Cytoscreen human IL-4 ( detection limit , 7.8 pg/mL ) , Cytoscreen human IFN-y ( 15.6 pg/mL ) , human IL-2 ( 1.1 U/mL ) enzyme-amplified sensitivity immunoassay ( BioSource , Camarillo , CA ) , and IL-13 ( 7.8 pg/mL ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kits ( Immuno-tech , Marseille , France ) .
Cell viability was assessed by using trypan blue or INHIBITION OF T-CELL IL-4 EXPRESSION BY ASPIRIN _ 1743 propidium iodide exclusion .
In selected experiments , cells treated with ASA , SA , or mouse antihuman CD95 ( BioSource ) were analyzed for expression of early apoptotic markers by staining with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ; ApoAlert ; ClonTech , Palo Alto , CA ) .
RNA isolation and analysis The expression of cytokine transcripts was analyzed by reverse transcriptase , polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) of total RNA extracted 6 hours after stimulation with the Trizol reagent ( Life Technologies ) . ''

Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were from Stratagene ( La Jolla , CA ) .
IL-4 transcripts were quantified by real-time RT-PCR . ''
Total RNA ( 10 ng/sample ) was subjected to RT-PCR using the GeneAmp Gold kit ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) .
Quantitative determination of the amplified products was done with an ABI Prism 7700 System ( Applied Biosystems ) .
The forward and reverse primers were 5 -CGACTGCACAGCAGTTCCA-3 '' ' and 5-CAGGCCCCAGAGGT-TCC-3 ' , respectively ( Applied Biosystems ) .
The detection probe , labeled with the reporter dye 6-carboxy-fluorescein ( Apx , 518 nm ) at the 5 ' end and the quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine ( A ; , , , , , 582 nm ) at the 3 '' end , was 5-TCCGATTCCTGAAACGGCTCGACA-3 ' ( Applied Biosystems ) .
GAPDH was monitored by using reagents from Applied Biosystems .
Cycle threshold ( C ; ) values were calculated for IL-4 and GAPDH .
The relative IL-4 transcript levels in treated ( T ) and control ( C ) samples were expressed as 2-AAC ; , in which AACr = ACrmy - AGrg , and AC ; = Crary - for each experimental condition .
Transient transfections and analysis of reporter gene expression The 1L-4.265 , IL-4.225 , IL-4.145 , IL-4.95 , and IL-4.65 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmids were constructed by insertion in the HindIII and Xbal sites of pCAT-Basic ( Promega , Madison , WI ) of PCR-generated fragments spanning base pairs ( bp ) -265 , -225 , -145 , -95 , and -65 , respectively , to +55 of the human IL-4 gene .

Results Aspirin selectively inhibits IL-4 secretion from CD4+ T cells We studied the effects of ASA on the secretion of effector cytokines from freshly isolated CD4* PBT .
Suppression of PG production in monocytes may contribute to the reported enhancing effects of NSAIDs , including ASA , on T-cell proliferation and IFN-y and IL-2 expression . ''
Although both COX-1 and COX-2 have been reported to be expressed in human T cells , the importance of this finding is not clear . ''
To minimize the contribution of monocytes or other accessory cells to the possible effects of ASA on T-cell activation , we purified CD3*CD4* cells to at least 97 % by means of negative selection from enriched PBT preparations .
CD4+* PBT were treated with increasing concentrations of ASA ( 10-5-3 X M ) 15 minutes before stimulation with the Ca++ ionophore A23187 ( 0.5 pg/mL ) and the protein kinase C ( PKC ) agonist PMA ( 25 ng/mL ) .
These concentrations of ASA were chosen on the basis of the plasma levels known to be therapeutic in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions . '' ''
Figure 1A shows the effect of 10~ '' M ASA on IL-4 , IL-13 , IFN-y , and IL-2 secretion in these experiments .
ASA did not affect the production of IL-13 , IFN-y , and IL-2 , but it significantly inhibited IL-4 secretion ( by 47 % + 2.4 % in 3 experiments ; P < .05 ) .
As shown in Figure 1B , 10-3 M ASA was the lowest concentration that significantly inhibited IL-4 expression in these cultures , whereas none of the concentrations tested affected IL-2 secretion .
Similar results were obtained with enriched preparations containing about 45 % CD4+* PBT and substantial percentages of accessory cells .
Figure 1C shows the effect of 10~ ' M ASA on IL-4 expression in these preparations , stimulated with either A23187 ( 0.25 g/mL ) and PMA ( 25 ng/mL ) or with anti-CD3 ( 3 pg/mL ) and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies ( 5 ug/mL ) .
A short incubation ( 15 minutes ) with this concentration of ASA consistently and significantly inhibited IL-4 secretion , irrespective of the stimulants used .
Although ASA did not affect IL-2 secretion in cells stimulated with A23187 and PMA , it enhanced expression of this cytokine induced by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 or by A23187 alone ( data not shown ) .
Figure 1D shows that 10~ ' M ASA inhibited to a comparable degree IL-4 expression in mitogen-primed enriched PBT stimulated with A23187 and PMA .
Although expression of IL-4 was at a lower level in these cultures than in freshly isolated PBT , presumably because of the antagonizing effects of Th1-associated cytokines , '' '' ASA was at least as effective at inhibiting IL-4 production in cells cultured under Th2-biasing conditions , such as inclusion of IL-4 ( 50 ng/mL ) in the priming medium ( Figure 1D ) .

COX inhibition and acetylation play no role in IL-4 inhibition by aspirin To assess whether inhibition of PG generation might account for IL-4 inhibition by ASA , we compared the effects of different COX inhibitors on expression of this cytokine in purified CD4* PBT .
Figure 2 shows that among several NSAIDs , only SA , the weakest inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 in this pharmacologic group , '' inhibited IL-4 expression to an extent comparable to that of ASA .
In striking contrast to this finding , the potent COX inhibitors FBP and IM , used at concentrations in or above their respective COX-inhibitory and therapeutic ranges , '' did not affect IL-4 expression ( Figure 2 ) .
Neither of these compounds significantly affected IL-2 secretion .
In these experiments , ASA or other NSAIDs did not affect cell viability , as assessed by trypan blue or propidium iodide exclusion .

PBT , we conducted parallel experiments to analyze the binding of FITC-labeled annexin V after treatment with increasing concentrations ( 1074-3 X 10- M ) of the 2 salicylates and stimulation with A23187 and PMA .
`` ° A 20-hour incubation with 3 X 10-3 M ASA produced 6 % annexin V-binding cells , a frequency that did not differ substantially from that in DMSO-treated control samples .
Similar results were obtained in experiments using SA , IM , or FBP , whereas up to 11.9 % of cells were stained by annexin V after similar incubation with anti-€CD95 antibodies ( data not shown ) .
Aspirin inhibits IL-4 gene expression at the transcriptional level Decreased IL-4 secretion was paralleled by reduced accumulation of IL-4 message in CD4+* PBT treated with ASA .
Figure 3A shows the inhibitory effect of 10- '' M ASA on IL-4 RNA expression in cells stimulated with 0.5 g/mL A23187 and 10 ng/mL PMA .
Also shown is that this concentration of ASA did not affect IL-13 , IFN-y , or IL-2 expression in these experiments .
The degree of IL-4 RNA inhibition by ASA was analyzed by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR .
In 3 such experiments , IL-4 RNA levels were decreased by 56.4 % + 7.3 % and 71.2 % + 6 % in CD4* PBT treated with 10- M and 3 X 10- > M ASA , respectively ( Figure 3B ) .
A comparable decrease was observed in cells treated with the same concentrations of SA ( data not shown ) , whereas 10-5 M IM had no effect ( Figure 3B ) .
Similar results were obtained in the Jurkat human T-cell line ( data not shown ) .
To investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating the inhibitory effect of salicylates on IL-4 gene expression , we analyzed the effects of these compounds on IL-4 promoter activity in transiently transfected Jurkat cells .
As shown in Figure 3C , ASA ( 10-5-10-3 M ) caused concentration-dependent decrease of CAT expression driven by a 265-bp IL-4 promoter fragment in Jurkat cells stimulated with A23187 ( 0.5 pg/mL ) , whereas it did not affect constitutive IL-4 promoter activity .
The degree and concentration dependency of IL-4 promoter inhibition by ASA closely matched our findings on IL-4 secretion and transcript expression in PBT ( Figures 1B and 3B ) .
In contrast , ASA did not inhibit , but slightly enhanced , IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat cells stimulated with A23187 and PMA ( Figure 3C ) .
Enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity was especially obvious at lower concentrations of ASA and after suboptimal stimulation ( data not shown ) .
INHIBITION OF T-CELL IL-4 EXPRESSION BY ASPIRIN _ 1745 IL-4 gene inhibition by aspirin is not associated with reduced NF- « B activation Significant inhibition of IL-4 expression was observed consistently in cells treated with 10-3 M ASA .
A concentration 2.5 to 5 times higher was previously reported to be necessary for comparable inhibition of NF-kB DNA-binding and transcriptional activities . '' ''
To determine whether lower concentrations of salicylates might affect NF-kB activation under our experimental conditions , we conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) using nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells treated with ASA or the related compound SSA , a known potent and selective inhibitor of NF-kB . ''
Figure 4A shows an experiment in which stimulation with A23187 ( 0.5 pg/mL ) and PMA ( 10 ng/mL ) resulted in formation of 2 complexes on an oligonucleotide spanning a consensus NF-kB element from the -light-chain gene ( lane 2 ) .
Consistent with previous findings , * ' neither complex formed when extracts from cells stimulated with A23187 alone were used ( lane 5 ) .
Antibodies raised against the p65 ( lane 3 ) and p50 ( lane 4 ) NF-kB subunits interfered with formation of both complexes .

The effect of SSA on activation was not paralleled by an increased inhibitory effect , relative to ASA , on IL-4 promoter activity ( Figure 4B ) .
ASA and SA were the strongest inhibitors of IL-4 promoter-driven transcription among a panel of structurally related compounds .
In these experiments , SSA and 2,5-dihydroxy-benzoic acid , a major hydroxylated ASA metabolite in vivo , '' inhibited promoter activity by about 40 % , whereas other salicylates were completely ineffective ( data not shown ) .
Figure 4B shows the effects of identical concentrations of ASA and SSA ( 2 X 10- '' M ) on A23187-induced CAT expression in Jurkat cells transfected with the I1L-4.265 construct .
SSA was significantly less effective than ASA in inhibiting transcriptional activity of this construct .
IL-4 promoter activity was not affected in cells treated with 5-aminosal-icylic acid ( 5-ASA ) , the salicylate moiety of SSA previously found to be a relatively ineffective inhibitor of NF- « B activation . ''

ASA and SA ( 107 M ) were equally effective at inhibiting the activation of IL-4 promoter constructs truncated at bp -265 through -145 ( data not shown ) .
Figure 5A shows that CAT expression was significantly inhibited in Jurkat cells transfected with a construct carrying an IL-4 promoter fragment spanning bp -145 to +55 ( IL-4.145 ) and treated with ASA or SA ( 10-2 M ) but not FBP ( 10-5 M ) .
The same concentrations of ASA and FBP but not SA up-regulated the transcriptional activity of an IL-4 promoter construct ( IL-4.95 ) lacking bp -145 to -96 ( Figure 5A ) .

The sequence of the salicylate-targeted region of the human IL-4 promoter is shown in Figure 5B .
Integrity of this region appears to be critical for maximal IL-4 promoter activity in murine and human T cells.4 > ** An inverted CCAAT box at bp -114 is the only element in this region of the IL-4 promoter that has been characterized , and it binds the ubiquitous and constitutive factor CBF , also known as NF-Y .
However , sequence analysis revealed the existence of additional putative binding sites for several plausible candidates for IL-4 gene regulation in differentiated T cells ( Figure 5B ) .
These include an 80 % conserved Ets-binding site at bp - 128 , '' an E box ( CANNTG ) at bp -103 , *5 and an E2 box at bp -119 that is known to be recognized by multi-zinc-finger factors such as ZEB .
* '' Although factors binding to such elements have been found to be involved in T-cell pathophysiology and the development of immune and inflammatory responses , none have yet been characterized as a regulator of IL-4 expression or a salicylate target .
To understand the relative contribution of each of these elements and their cognate factors to IL-4 transcriptional regulation by salicylates , we generated 3 oligonucleotides spanning overlapping sequences in a region including bp -155 to -90 of the IL-4 promoter ( Figure 5B ) .

ASA did not affect the pattern of complex formation in EMSAs using an 1IL-4.155 probe or an oligonucleotide centered on the CCAAT box ( IL-4.CCAAT ; data not shown ) .
Similar results were obtained with extracts from A23187- and PMA-stimulated , ASA- or SA-treated PBT ( data not shown ) .
To further characterize the ASA-responsive complex forming on IL-4.135 , we tested several antibodies , including IgG specific for the factors Ets-1 and Ets-2 , NFAT-1 , and CBF , in EMSAs using extracts from activated Jurkat cells or PBT .
None of these affected complex formation in these experiments ( data not shown ) .
Discussion This study is the first to find that therapeutic concentrations of ASA '' significantly inhibit IL-4 gene expression in activated CD4+ T cells .
Inhibition of IL-4 secretion in cells treated with ASA was not associated with reduced viability , impaired basic biochemical and molecular functions , or expression of early apoptotic markers .
Indeed , depending on the stimulants used , IL-2 production was not inhibited or was moderately enhanced after treatment with ASA .
Similarly , ASA did not affect expression of the effector cytokines IL-13 and IFN-y in CD4+* PBT .
The results of our experiments in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells indicate that the effect of ASA on IL-4 expression is exerted at the transcriptional level .
Our findings can not be accounted for by the reported inhibitory effects of ASA on PG generation or NF-KB activation , '' and they suggest involvement of an alternative mechanism of action of salicylates .
To our knowledge , our experiments using purified PBT and Jurkat cells provide the first evidence that CD4* T cells may be a direct target of ASA and related compounds .
The hypothesis that inhibition of immunomodulatory PGs mediates the effect of ASA on IL-4 production in these cells ! ''
was not validated by our experiments using structurally unrelated COX inhibitors ( Figures 2 and 5A ) .
Moreover , T cells have been reported to produce negligible amounts of known COX products , with almost 100-fold-lower PGE , levels than required to modulate cytokine produc-tion .
* '' *+38 Previous studies using peripheral blood mononuclear cell or unfractionated PBT preparations showed that submillimolar concentrations of ASA can enhance several aspects of mitogen-induced T-cell activation , including proliferative responses and the expression of IFN-y and IL-2 . ''
Although these effects of ASA have been related to its ability to suppress production of monocyte-derived PGs , '' prolonged ( 96-hour ) incubation with several nonsali-cylic NSAIDs was found to enhance mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production in the absence of monocytes . ''
However , this finding was not confirmed in subsequent studies of long-term ( > 72-hour ) in vitro effects of ASA and SA on monocyte-depleted PBT preparations . ''
In our study , which focused on the short-term effects of ASA on isolated CD4* T cells , IL-2 expression and promoter activity were enhanced only under specific stimulation conditions , and lower concentrations of ASA ( 10-5-107+ M ) appeared to be more effective , presumably because of the concentration-dependent involvement of opposite mechanisms of action .
None of the concentrations of ASA used in our study significantly affected production of IL-13 and IFN-y in CD4+* PBT .
Taken together , these findings indicate that IL-4 is a preferential target of INHIBITION OF T-CELL IL-4 EXPRESSION BY ASPIRIN _ 1747 salicylates in these cells , thus pointing to the existence of unique molecular pathways that regulate expression of this cytokine gene in human T cells .
Several reports indicated that NSAIDs , including ASA and SA , can induce an increase in intracellular Ca+* and the transient activation of PKC in T cells .
' '' 2 '' These 2 events are thought to be necessary and sufficient for antigen- and mitogen-dependent T-cell activation and cytokine gene expression . '' ''
Indeed , one study found that FBP can activate the Ca+**- or PKC-dependent factors NFAT , AP-1 , and NF-kB in unfractionated PBT .
* However , the relation between these findings and the results of our study is unclear .
Although these phenomena have been cited to explain the comitogenic potential of ASA and other NSAIDs , they are not necessarily associated with T-cell activation and IL-2 production , presumably because of their intrinsically transient nature . '' ''
Furthermore , the idea that NSAIDs , particularly ASA and SA , function as adjuvants in host immune responses was challenged in studies showing the COX-independent inhibitory effect of ASA on the activation of NF-kB and other critical transcriptional activators in T cells and other types of cells.8 ! ® ASA inhibits NF- « B nuclear translocation at much higher concentrations ( > 2.5 X 10- M ) than its reported concentration that inhibits by 50 % COX-1 ( ~2 X 10-5 M ) and COX-2 ( ~3 xX 10-4 M ) .
`` ® Indeed , higher doses of ASA than are required to inhibit PG generation are used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases.© However , salicylate-related toxicity ( eg , tinnitus ) can occur with SA plasma levels as low as 1.2 X 10- '' M. '' Significant inhibition of IL-4 expression or promoter activity in our study was obtained with ASA or SA concentrations of 10-3 M or lower ( Figure 3B ) , well within the reported therapeutic range for these compounds ( 0.8-1.7 X 10-3 M ) . ''
In this study , we confirmed that these concentrations of ASA are not sufficient to affect NF-KB DNA-binding and transcriptional activity ( Figure 4A ) .8 '' ° On the other hand , the structurally related compound SSA , although it caused , as reported previously , '' '' almost complete inhibition of NE-xB DNA binding ( Figure 4A ) , was a significantly less effective inhibitor of IL-4 promoter activity than ASA or SA ( Figure 4B ) .
ASA effectively inhibited IL-4 promoter activation in cells stimulated with a Ca+* ionophore ( Figure 3B ) .
Although the engagement of Ca+**-delivered signals is necessary and sufficient for maximal activation of the IL-4 gene in several T-cell lines and clones , including Jurkat cells , '' '' our study confirmed that PKC coactivation by PMA is a stringent requirement for NF-kB induction in these cells ( Figure 4A ) .4 ' Although NF- « B is a necessary activator of the IL-2 gene , '' it contributes significantly to IL-4 down-regulation by PMA .
* '' In our study , however , ASA and SA inhibited IL-4 expression without affecting IL-2 expression , at a concentration ( 3 X 10- > M ) reported to cause at least 50 % inhibition of NF- « B-induced transcription.© Taken together , our findings indicate that a factor other than NF-KB is involved in the inhibitory effect of salicylates on IL-4 transcription .
The mechanisms regulating IL-4 gene expression in human and murine CD4* T cells have been the focus of intensive investigation during the past few years . ''
Members of the NFAT family of transcription factors are thought to have a critical role in the activation of antigen-dependent IL-4 gene expression in T cells.59 '' 4 Although the known NFAT molecular species appear to be expressed at similar levels in Th1 and Th2 cells , NFAT-directed IL-4 transcription is preferentially induced in Th2 cells , presumably because of the involvement of lineage-restricted coactiva-tors . ''
NFAT , however , is not a reasonable candidate for a molecular target of salicylates in our experimental system .
Ca+**-and calcineurin-dependent activation of NFAT also appears to From www .

etal be a requirement for expression of IFN-y , IL-2 , and perhaps 1L-13.5 % 5*5 $ .5 '' Moreover , increased NFAT nuclear mobilization and DNA binding after treatment with FBP was observed in isolated PBT .
* '' We previously found that ASA can up-regulate NFAT nuclear expression and NFAT-driven transcription . '' ''
ASA , but not SA or SSA , increased formation of an NFAT-1-containing complex on the P1 element , which was paralleled by sustained nuclear expression of NFAT-1 in Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments using PBT or Jurkat cells . ''
These effects , shared with other COX inhibitors , such as IM and FBP , likely account for increased transcriptional activity of a minimal IL-4 promoter construct ( IL-4.95 ; Figure 5A ) but are clearly dissociated from COX -independent inhibition of IL-4 expression , in analogy with results of previous studies of COX-2 gene regulation . '' '' ''
Taken together , our observations are consistent with the idea that a previously unrecognized transcriptional target accounts for the inhibitory effect of salicylates on IL-4 expression .
In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that the proximal 88 bp of the IL-4 promoter , including the NFAT-binding PO and P1 elements ( Figure 5B ) , are sufficient to mediate proper lineage-restricted and mito-gen- or antigen-induced IL-4 expression in distinct Th subsets . ''
However , our finding that IL-4 gene inhibition by salicylates involves DNA-protein interactions in a region upstream of bp -95 is in agreement with the idea that multiple promoter elements contribute to IL-4 gene activation in differentiated T cells.3 > 354344 We found that ASA affects formation of an inducible complex on a discrete region of the human IL-4 promoter between bp -135 and -110 .
On the basis of our findings and sequence homology , we infer that an Ets family member other than Ets-1 and Ets-2 , a zinc-finger protein such as ZEB , or both , may contribute critically to formation of this complex . ''
Although this observation provides a mechanistic basis for the inhibitory effects of salicylates on IL-4 transcription in T cells , additional studies are necessary to determine the precise location and sequence of a discrete ASA References BLOOD , 15 MARCH 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 6 responsive element on this region of the IL-4 promoter as well as the identity and function of its cognate factor or factors .
IL-4 , the prototypic cytokine expressed in Th2 cells , plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hematopoiesis and immune and inflammatory responses and is involved in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of disease conditions . '' ''
Although suppression of Th1 responses by means of NF-KB inhibition occurs at ASA doses well above the therapeutic range , '' ? ''
lower concentrations of ASA can enhance ( by means of inhibition of monocyte PG generation ) the in vitro and ex vivo expression of at least some Th1 cytokines and inherently counteract Th2 responses . ''
Therefore , NSAIDs have been evaluated as possible adjuvants of Th1-driven antiviral responses ' '' '' '' and in the management of Th2-associated and IL-4-associated conditions such as atopic asthma or rhinitis.© '' '' '' It was shown that topical treatment with lysin-ASA or SA , but not IM , can prevent the early asthmatic response to inhaled allergen , '' a finding consistent with the critical role of IL-4 in the development of such reactions . '' ''
IL-4 and Th2 responses are also involved in vernal conjunctivitis , '' juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , '' Kawasaki disease , '' '' and other conditions in which the effectiveness of salicylates is well documented .
`` * '' '' Our study , which showed direct inhibition of IL-4 production in T cells independent of COX and NF-KB activity , provides a new rationale for and creates new perspectives on the therapeutic applications of ASA and related compounds .
