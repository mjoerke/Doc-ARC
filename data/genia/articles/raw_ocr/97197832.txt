From the { Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology , NCI , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892-4255 and \Section of Immunobiology and Department of Biology , Howard Hughes Medical Institute Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven Connecticut 06510 The Jak1 , Jak2 , Jak3 , and Fes tyrosine kinases have been demonstrated to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to interleukin ( IL ) -4 stimulation in different cell systems .
However , it is not clear which , if any , of these kinases are responsible for initiating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates in vivo .
In the present study , we have utilized a mutant Jakl-deficient HeLa cell line , E1C3 , and its parental Jakl-expressing counterpart , 1D4 , to analyze the role of Jakl in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events .
IL-4 treatment rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) -1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 but not in E1C3 cells .
IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 was pronounced in 1D4 cells , while no IL-4-induced Stat6 phosphorylation was detected in E1C3 cells .
IL-4 also induced Stat6 DNA binding activity from lysates of 1D4 but not E1C3 cells utilizing a radiolabeled immunoglobulin heavy chain germline e promotor sequence ( Ie ) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Reconstitution of Jak1 expression in E1C3 cells restored the ability of IL-4 to induce IRS and Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation .
These results provide evidence that Jak1l expression is required for mediating tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of crucial molecules involved in IL-4 signal transduction .
Interleukin ( IL ) '-4 is known to play a critical role in determining the nature of an immune response to a given pathogen .
In addition , IL-4 has been demonstrated to mediate a diverse array of proliferative and functional effects in cells of nonhematopoietic origin ( 1 ) .
The multifunctional role of IL-4 is reflected by the ubiquitous expression of IL-4 receptors ( IL-4Rs ) in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types ( 2-4 ) .
The cDNA encoding a high affinity subunit for the human IL-4R has been cloned and termed IL-4Ra ( 5 , 6 ) .

6556 IL-4Ra sequence revealed that it is a member of the hemato-poietin receptor superfamily .
While IL-4Ra possesses a large cytoplasmic domain of approximately 500 amino acids , no consensus sequences for tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases have been identified .
It has been demonstrated that IL-4 can also utilize the y chain of the IL-2 receptor ( IL-2Ry ) in a complex with IL-4Ra to enhance ligand binding and signal transduction ( 7 , 8 ) .
Despite the lack of a tyrosine kinase domain in the cytoplasmic region of either IL-4Ra or IL-2Ry , IL-4 stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-4Ra « and certain intracellular signaling molecules .
IL-4 treatment has been demonstrated to result in tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor sub-strate-1 ( IRS-1 ) , IRS-2 ( formerly termed 4PS ) , Stat6 , and other undefined molecules ( 9-16 ) .
We have previously established that expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 are required for efficient IL-4-mediated mitogenesis in 32D myeloid cells ( 17 , 18 ) .
Recent studies characterizing the phenotype of Stat6 '~ mice have provided evidence that Stat6 expression is required for multiple functional responses induced by IL-4 and strongly implicate Stat6 involvement in IL-4-induced proliferative effects ( 19-21 ) .
It is well established that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins is essential for their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they activate transcription ( 22 , 23 ) .
These studies substantiate that tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation events play an integral role in implementing IL-4 signal transduction .
Three members of the Janus kinase family , Jak1 , Jak2 , and Jak3 , and the Fes proto-oncogene product are the only tyrosine kinases that have been reported to become tyrosine phosphorylated and/or activated in response to IL-4 stimulation in different cell systems ( 24-28 ) .
While IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak1 , Jak3 , and Fes has been demonstrated in many cell systems ( 24-27 ) , phosphorylation of Jak2 has only been reported to occur in human colon carcinoma cells ( 28 ) .
It has been demonstrated that IL-4 stimulation induces Jak1 and Fes association with IL-4Ra , while Jak3 has been shown to interact with IL-2Ry ( 24-27 ) .
Cotransfection studies in COS cells and in vitro experiments have indicated that both Jak1 and Jak3 are able to associate with and mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 ( 29 , 30 ) .
However , it has not been determined which , if any , of these kinases are involved in mediating IL-4-induced phosphorylation of downstream signaling substrates under physiological conditions .
In the present study , we have utilized a mutant HeLa cell line , originally isolated based on its lack of interferon responsive-ness , that is deficient in Jakl expression and its parental counterpart that does express Jak1 ( 31 , 32 ) to determine if this This paper is available on line at http : //www-jbc.stanford.edu/jbc/ 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog Jak1 Requirement for IL-4 Signal Transduction tyrosine kinase is responsible for mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events in vivo .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-The 1D4 and E1C3 Hela cell lines have been previously described ( 31 , 32 ) .
The human T lymphoid Jurkat cell line was a kind gift from Dr. L. Samelson , and the human monocytic U987 and B lymphoid Ramos cell lines were obtained from the ATCC .
Human recombinant IL-4 was obtained from Peprotech and insulin was from Upstate Biotechnology , Inc. Murine anti-Jakl monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) was obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories , anti-phosphotyrosine mAb , anti-Jak2 , and anti-Jak3 sera were from Upstate Biotechnology , Inc. , and anti-Fes mAb was from Oncogene Sciences .
The phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated IL-4 fluorokine receptor reagent kit was obtained from R & D Systems .
Rabbit anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 sera were generated by immunization of rabbits with baculovirus-ex-pressed rat IRS-1 protein or an IRS-2-specific peptide comprised of amino acid residues 1810 to 1822 ( LSHHLKEATVVKE ) , respectively .
The anti-IRS-1 serum very weakly recognizes IRS-2 , while anti-IRS-2 serum does not recognize IRS-1 .
The anti-Stat6 peptide serum used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis was raised against amino acid residues 787-804 ( GEDIFPPLLPPTEQDLTK ) of human Stat6 .
Flow Cytometry-The adherent 1D4 and E1C3 HeLa cell lines were treated with 0.5 mM EDTA to facilitate their removal from the sub-strate .
Helia and Ramos cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and resuspended at 5 X 10° cells/ml .
PE-conjugated IL-4 ( 10 ul ) was added to 25 pl of washed cells .
As a negative control , 20 ul of anti-human IL-4 neutralizing antibody was mixed with 10 ul of PE-conjugated IL-4 and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before addition to the cell suspensions .
Samples were incubated for 2 h at 16 °C and washed twice with PBS containing 0.1 % NaN , .
Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan ( Becton-Dickenson ) .

The total protein content of the lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay .
Equal amounts of clarified cell lysates ( 0.5-1 mg ) were immunoprecipitated with different antisera ( 1:500 ) plus 80 ul of protein G-coupled Sepharose ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) .
Immunopre-cipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer , solubilized with Laemmli buffer , boiled , and resolved by 8 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) .
For direct immunoblot analysis , proteins from lysates of the various cell lines ( 200 ug ) were directly resolved by SDS-PAGE without prior serum starvation .
Immunoblot analysis was performed by transferring separated proteins onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Immo-bilon-P ; Millipore ) in Tris-glyceride buffer containing 20 % methanol .
The membrane was then treated for 1-2 h with 8 % non-fat dry milk in TTBS ( 20 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 7.5 ) , 154 mM NaCl , 0.05 % Tween , 0.05 % NaN , , ) , incubated with antibodies in TTBS containing 0.5 % BSA ( TTBS-BSA ) for 1 to 2 h ( concentration of antibodies : 2 ug/ml for anti-Tyr ( P ) and 1:500 for the remaining antisera ) and reacted with '* '' T-labeled protein A ( 3 X 10° cpm/ul ) in TTBS-BSA for 1 h. Alternatively , bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Amersham Corp. ) .
All procedures were done at room temperature , and membranes were washed extensively with TTBS after each treatment .
After the final wash , the membrane was rinsed with distilled water , air dried and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at -70 °C .
Electrophorectic Mobility Shift Assay-DNA oligonucleotide probes used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) were annealed , labeled , purified , and whole cell extracts were prepared for EMSA essentially as described previously ( 14-16 , 38 ) .
The sequence of one strand of the double-stranded Ie probe used for EMSA was 5'-GATCTA-ACTTCCCAAGAACAG-3 ' .
Briefly , 1D4 and E1C3 cells were serum-starved overnight and treated for 10 min with IL-4 ( 100 ng/ml ) .
Cells were washed once with PBS containing 100 uM Na , VO , and solubilized in gel shift lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 8.0 ) , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 10 % glycerol , 100 um EDTA , 50 mM NaF , 167 mM NaCl , 100 uM Na , VO , , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 400 uM dimethyl sulfoxide , 1 ug/ml aprotinin , 1 ug/ml leupeptin , and 1 ug/ml pepstatin ) by incubation on ice for 1 h and 6557 A Jurkat 1D4 E1C3 1D4 E1C3 Jurkat Jurkat 1D4 E1C3 u937 1D4 E1C3 wil - ] ~ es 97 - | I Ta < Fes Blot : anti- anti- - anti- anti-Jaki Jak2 - Jak3 Fes Relative Cell Number us Fluorescence Intensity Fig .

Transient Transfection Assay-E1C3 cells ( 4 X 10° ) were plated in a 10-mm tissue culture dish 24 h before transfection in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
Cells were transfected with 10 ug of a retroviral expression vector containing murine JAK1 cDNA ( a kind gift from Dr. Warren Leonard ) and 40 ug of carrier DNA using the calcium phosphate method .
Eighteen hours after transfection , cells were washed and incubated in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum for 7-12 h. Cells were then serum-starved as described previously and used for subsequent experiments .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To confirm that parental 1D4 HeLa cells expressed Jak1 and that mutant EIC3 Hela cells were Jak1l-deficient , whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis utilizing an anti-Jakl mAb .
A 130-kDa protein was readily expressed in 1D4 cells , while no protein in this size range was observed in EIC3 cells ( Fig .
1A ) .
The 130-kDa protein was also detected in Jurkat cells that are known to express Jak1 ( Fig .
1A ) .
The status of Jak2 , Jak3 , and Fes expression in the two Hela cell lines was also examined by immunoblot analysis , since these tyrosine kinases have also been demonstrated to become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-4 treatment ( 24 , 25 , 27 , 28 ) .
Anti-Jak2 serum recognized a 130-kDa protein in Jurkat , 1D4 , and EIC3 cells ( Fig .
14 ) .
A Jak2 degradation product of 97 kDa was also observed in all three lines .
Anti-Jak3 serum specifically detected the expression of a 120-kDa protein in Jurkat cells , while no protein in this size range was observed in either 1D4 or E1C3 cells ( Fig .
14 ) .
A 92-kDa protein was detected in human U937 myeloid cells that are known to express Fes but not in 1D4 or E1C3 cells utilizing an anti-Fes mAb ( Fig .
14 ) .
Thus , mutant EIC3 cells do not detectably express Jak1 , Jak3 , or Fes but do express Jak2 .

IL-4 mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 but not in E1C3 cells .
1D4 or E1C3 cells were untreated ( 0 ) or stimulated with IL-4 or insulin ( INS ) .
Lysates were immunoprecipitated ( ZP ) with A , anti-IRS-1 or B , anti-IRS-2 serum , proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , and transferred proteins were immunoblotted ( Blot ) with anti-phosphotyrosine ( anti-PY ) , as designated .
Molecular mass markers are shown in kilodaltons .
The positions of IRS-1 and IRS-2 are indicated by arrowheads .
IL-4Rs have been detected on a wide variety of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types at levels ranging from 100 to 5000 sites per cell ( 2-4 ) .
In order to compare IL-4-induced signal transduction events in the 1D4 and E1C3 cell lines , it was necessary to determine whether these lines expressed receptors capable of binding IL-4 .
As shown in Fig .
1B , 1D4 and E1C3 cells specifically bound PE-conjugated human IL-4 .
The human B Ramos cell line , which is known to express high levels of IL-4Rs ( 2 ) , was also found to specifically bind PE-conjugated human IL-4 .
These results demonstrate that mutant E1C3 cells and their 1D4 parental counterpart express detectable levels of cell surface IL-4Rs .
The ability of IL-4 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 and E1C3 was next examined .
Cells were serum starved and either untreated or stimulated with IL-4 or insulin .
Insulin treatment was performed because it is known to mediate potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS mol-ecules , and evidence suggests that activated insulin receptors directly associate with and phosphorylate these substrates ( 34-36 ) .
Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for either IRS-1 or IRS-2 and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis utilizing anti-phosphotyrosine .
IL-4 treatment of 1D4 cells resulted in pronounced tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 , while no detectable phosphorylation of either substrate was observed in E1C3 cells in response to IL-4 stimulation ( Fig .
24 and B ) .
However , insulin treatment led to equivalent increases in the phosphotyrosine content of IRS-1 and IRS-2 molecules in both cell lines .
Immunoblot analysis of the same samples with either anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 serum revealed that equivalent amounts of IRS proteins were present in each immunoprecipitate and that IRS expression was similar in both cell lines . ''
These results strongly suggest that IL-4-induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation is mediated through activation of Jak1 , while insulin-induced IRS phosphorylation does not require Jak1 expression .
It has been established that IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 and binding of Stat6 to a specific DNA consensus sequence , TTCC ( A > T , N ) GGAA ( 13-16 ) .
To determine if Jakl expression is required for mediating these events , we first analyzed whether IL-4 could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 in the two HeLa cell lines .
Lysates prepared from untreated or IL-4-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated 2 X. H. Chen and L.-M. Wang , unpublished data .

IL-4 induces Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation in 1D4 but not in E1C3 cells .
1D4 or E1C3 cells were untreated ( 0 ) or treated with IL-4 .
Lysates were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with anti-Stat6 serum and subsequently immunoblotted ( Blof ) with A , anti-phosphotyrosine ( anti-PY ) or B , anti-Stat6 serum .
Molecular mass markers are shown in kilodaltons , and the positions of Stat6 are indicated by arrowheads .
C , whole cell lysates from untreated ( 0 ) or IL-4-stimulated 1D4 or E1C3 cells were incubated with *°P-labeled Ie for 10 min and assayed by EMSA as indicated under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
The position of the IL-4-induced Ie mobility shift is indicated by an arrowhead .
with antiserum specific for human Stat6 , proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , and transferred proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis utilizing anti-phosphotyrosine .
While IL-4 stimulation of 1D4 cells resulted in evident tyrosine phosphorylation of a 100-kDa protein specifically recognized by anti-Stat6 serum , no tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in this size range was detected in response to IL-4 treatment of E1C3 cells ( Fig .
34 ) .
Immunoblot analysis of the same immunoprecipitated lysates with anti-Stat6 serum demonstrated that Stat6 expression levels were comparable in the 1D4 and E1C3 cell lines ( Fig .
3B ) .
Stat6 can be distinguished from other Stat proteins by its ability to bind to a specific consensus sequence found in the immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line promotor of the IL-4-responsive human Ce gene , designated Ie .
To determine whether IL-4 could induce Stat6 binding activity in 1D4 and E1C3 cells , whole cell extracts from untreated or IL-4-treated cells were prepared and assayed for the induction of °°P-labeled Ie DNA binding activity by EMSA .
IL-4 stimulation of 1D4 cells led to rapid induction of Ie binding , while no detectable binding activity could be observed after IL-4 treatment of E1C3 cells ( Fig .
3C ) .
Thus , Jakl expression appears to be required for mediating IL-4-induced Stat6 activation .
Since the E1C3 cell line was derived by mutagenesis with ethylmethane-sulfonate ( 31 ) , it remained possible that other functional defects could account for the inability of IL-4 to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation events in these cells .
There-fore , a mammalian expression vector containing murine Jakl cDNA was transiently transfected into E1C3 cells ( E1C3/Jak1 ) .
Immunoblot analysis revealed that Jakl protein levels attained in E1C3/Jak1 cells were equivalent to those in 1D4 cells ( Fig .
4A ) .

Transient expression of Jakl in E1C3 cells restores the ability of IL-4 to mediate IRS-1 , IRS-2 , and Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation .
E1C3 cells were transfected with a retroviral expression vector containing Jak1 cDNA as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
A , equivalent amounts of proteins from lysates of 1D4 , E1C3 , Jurkat , and EIC3/Jak1 cells were immunoblotted ( Blot ) with anti-Jak1 serum , as designated .
The Jak1 protein is indicated by an arrowhead and the molecular mass marker is in kilodaltons .
B , EIC3/Jak1 cells were unstimulated ( 0 ) or treated with IL-4 .
Lysates were immunoprecipitated ( JP ) with anti-phosphotyrosine ( anti-PY ) and immunoblotted ( Blof ) with anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 serum or C , immunoprecipitated ( ZP ) with anti-Stat6 and immunoblotted ( Blot ) with anti-phosphotyrosine ( anti-PY ) .
stimulated with IL-4 and IRS , and Stat6 phosphorylation was examined .
As shown in Fig .
4 , B and C , the ability of IL-4 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 , IRS-2 , and Stat6 was restored in the E1C3/Jak1 transfected cells .
The ability of IL-4 to induce binding of Stat6 to Ie as determined by EMSA was also reconstituted in the E1C3/Jak1 cells . ''
These data provide conclusive evidence that Jak1 expression is required for mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS and Stat6 molecules in the HeLa cell system .
A recent study demonstrated that Jak1 but not Jak2 or Tyk2 expression is crucial for IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules in a series of mutant derivatives of a human fibroblast cell line , HT 1080 ( 37 ) .
E1C3 cells express Jak2 ( see Fig .
1A ) and Tyk2 ( 32 ) , further excluding the possibility that these Janus kinases are involved in IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates .
However , our results do not rule out the possibility that Fes or Jak3 may be capable of evoking IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events in other cell types , since these kinases do not appear to be expressed in 1D4 or E1C3 lines .
It has been reported that Fes expression appears to be limited to cells of the myeloid lineage ( 88 ) .
Since it is well established that IL-4 affects numerous cell types other than those of myeloid origin , the role of Fes in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates would be severely restricted .
Jak3 is also preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells ( 89 ) .
Moreover , several recent studies have indicated that IL-2Ry expression is not necessarily required for IL-4 function ( 40-43 ) .
Since Jak3 has been demonstrated to associate with IL-2Ry ( 24 , 27 ) , this further suggests that it is unlikely that Jak3 is the primary kinase utilized by IL-4 for eliciting its biological functions .
We are presently attempting to express Jak3 and Fes in the E1C3 line to determine if these kinases can mediate IL-4-directed tyrosine phosphorylation .
It has been demonstrated that a variety of cytokines and growth factors activate Jak1 ( 23 ) .
We have obtained preliminary evidence that interferon- « - and -y-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules requires Jak1 expression .
* It will be of interest to determine whether other cytokines require Jak1 to direct tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules or other substrates under physiological conditions .
If so , this would suggest that Jakl plays a central role in mediating signal transduction through multiple non-tyrosine kinase-con-taining receptors .
In summary , our study strongly suggests that Jak1 is the primary kinase that couples with the IL-4R to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation of critical effector molecules involved in mediating IL-4 elicited signal transduction .
