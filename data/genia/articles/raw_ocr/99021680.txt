Cahalan From the Department of Physiology and Biophysics University of Califomia , Irvine Califomia 92697 Sum m ary The mechanism by which progesterone causes localized suppression of the immune response during pregnancy has remained elusive .
Using human T lymphocytes and T cell lines , we show that progesterone , at concentrations found in the placenta , rapidly and reversibly blocks voltage-gated and calcium-activated K* channels ( Ky and K. , , respectively ) , resulting in depolarization of the membrane potential .
As a result , Ca®* signaling and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) -driven gene expression are inhibited .
Progesterone acts distally to the initial steps of T cell receptor ( TCR ) -mediated signal transduction , since it blocks sustained Ca®* signals after thapsigargin stimulation , as well as oscillatory Ca** signals , but not the Ca®* transient after TCR stimulation .
K+ channel blockade by progesterone is specific ; other steroid hormones had little or no effect , although the progesterone antagonist RU 486 also blocked Ky and K. , channels .
Progesterone effectively blocked a broad spectrum of K* channels , reducing both Kv1.3 and charybdotoxin-resistant components of Ky current and Ky , current in T cells , as well as blocking several cloned Ky channels expressed in cell lines .
Progesterone had little or no effect on a cloned voltage-gated Na* channel , an inward rectifier K* channel , or on lymphocyte Ca*+* and CI- channels .
We propose that direct inhibition of K+ channels in T cells by progesterone contributes to progesterone- induced immunosuppression .
Key words : of activated T cells mmunosuppression within the uterus is crucial for the survival of the fetus ( 1 , 2 ) .
Although the maternal immune system becomes sensitized to paternal antigens during pregnancy , fetal cells and placental trophoblasts bearing those antigens do not elicit a cytolytic immune response ( 3-5 ) .
High concentrations of progesterone in the placenta inhibit the maternal immune response against the fetal al-lograft ( 6 , 7 ) .
The immunosuppressive effects of progesterone were demonstrated in vivo by prolonged survival of xe-nografts near silastic implants containing progesterone at concentrations typically found in the placenta ( 3 , 6 ) .
In vitro assays have established that progesterone inhibits lymphocyte activation and proliferation in response to allogeneic cells or mitogens ( 8-10 ) .
In contrast , progesterone does not inhibit the effector functions of previously activated cytolytic T cells ( 11 ) .
These data suggest that progesterone may interfere with the early phases of T cell activation .

Once the CR AC channels are open , the trans membrane concentration gradient for Ca®+ and the membrane potential ( F , , ) provide the driving force for Ca+ entry .
E , , , is set by the interplay between several ion channels in the T cell membrane .
By itself , the Ca*®+* current through CRAC channels would diminish the driving force for calcium entry by reducing E , , .
However , currents through voltage-gated K* ( Ky ) channels and Ca+-activated K* ( Ke , ) channels enhance Ca+ entry by driving E , , to a negative voltage .
Chloride channels may also play a role in maintaining a negative E , , during T cell activation ( 20 , 21 ) .
The four major types of ion channels found in T cells are possible targets for immunosuppressive agents .
In particular , the Ky channel encoded by Kv1.3 is required for normal lymphocyte activation both in vitro and in vivo ( 14 , 22-25 ) .
We have determined the effects of progesterone on lymphocyte ion channels , Ca®* signaling , and gene expression .
By combining functional assays of gene expression with patch-clamp and Ca*®*-imaging measurements , we demonstrate that progesterone blocks lymphocyte K+ channels , interferes with TCR -induced [ Ca '' + ] ; signaling , and inhibits gene expression .
We propose that progesterone acts as an endogenous immunosuppressant by directly and revers ibly blocking K* channels .

Results Progesterone Suppresses Gene Expression Driven by NF-AT .
The murine T cell hybridoma , B3Z , recognizes an oc-tapeptide fragment from ovalbumin ( SIINFEKL ) and expresses the lacZ reporter construct under transcriptional control of the NF-AT response element of the IL-2 promoter ( 26 , 27 ) .
Several treatments that increase [ Ca®+ ] ; lead to NF-AT-driven la expression in B3Z cells ( 13 ) , including TCR engagement or stimulation with TG , a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum C # +-ATPase ( 33 ) .
By flow cytometry in the present series of ex-periments , cross-linking the TCR with anti-CD3-€e antibodies or stimulating with TG plus PMA produced lak expression in the majority of B3Z cells ( 60 + 4 % , n = 7 ; or 72 + 10 % , n = 3 , respectively ) .
Progesterone reduced NF-AT-mediated laZ gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner , with an IC ; , value of 22 + 2.1 pM in cells stimulated by TG/PMA ( Fig .
1 A , filled ardes ) .
The progesterone antagonist RU 486 also inhibited gene expression with slightly lower potency ( Fig .
1 A , open squares ) .
Progesterone reduced laZ expression when B3Z cells were stimulated by TG alone or with PMA , by immobilized anti-CD3-e antibody , or by antigen presentation ( Fig .
1 B ) .
Thus , at concentrations normally obtained in the placenta ( 34 , 35 ) , progesterone inhibits NF-AT-mediated gene expression when driven by four treatments that increase [ Ca+ ] ; .
Our results with NF-AT-driven lak re porter gene expression are consistent with levels of progesterone or RU 486 shown previously to inhibit activation of human T cells in vitro ( 8 , 9 ) .
Progesterone Inhibits [ C* ] , Signals in T Cells after TCR Engagement or TG Stimulation .
- Upon contact with K897 cells preloaded with SIINFEKL , B3Z cells responded with an initial Ca®+* transient from a resting [ Ca '' + ] ; of 180 + 86 nM to a peak of 2.5 + 0.5 M ( n = 20 ) , followed by sustained Ca '' + oscillations ( Fig .
2 A ) .
In the absence of preloaded anti-gen , K897 cells did not elicit Ca+* signaling in B3Z cells ( data not shown ) .
Application of 50 M progesterone reversibly suppressed antigen-induced Ca+ oscillations ( Fig .
2 A ) .
To determine if progesterone directly inhibits TCR -ini-tiated signaling or interferes with costimulatory pathways , we activated the TCR complex by cross-linking CD3 .
Settling B3Z cells onto chambers coated with anti-CD3-e antibodies elicited an initial Ca®* transient followed by vigorous oscillations that continued for at least 40 min ( Fig .
2 B ) .
In the presence of 50 jyM progesterone , most cells produced only the initial Ca®* transient lasting 271 * 178 s , or a transient followed by severely attenuated oscillations ( r = 14 ; Fig .
2 C ) .
These data demonstrate that progesterone blocks C+ signaling after TCR engage-ment .
Since the initial Ca+ transient results from IP ; -mediated release of from intracellular stores , and the sustained Ca*+* signal requires Ca®* influx , these data also suggest that progesterone inhibits Ca+* influx but not the steps that lead to Ca*+* release from intracellular stores .
TG inhibits the Ca*®+* reuptake pump , leading to depletion of the intracellular Ca+* stores and Ca*+* influx while bypassing the initial steps of TCR signaling and IP ; generation ( 36 , 37 ) .
In resting human T cells , the addition of TG to the bathing solution increased [ Ca®+ ] ; from 72 + 8 nM to a stable plateau level of 1.2 + 0.1 wM ( n = 76 ; Fig .
3 A ) .
Progesterone reversibly inhibited the sustained C+ signal with an ICs , value of 28 + 2.7 pM ( Fig .
3 , A and Figure 1 .

Thus , progesterone blocks Ca+ influx subsequent to emptying of the Ca®+* stores .
Progesterone Depolanzes the Membrane Potential , Reduang the Driving Fore for C & @ * Entry .
C* influx depends upon the opening of CR AC channels and upon an electrochem-ical gradient for Ca®+* entry across the cell membrane .
The negative membrane potential supported by K* channels provides the electrical component of the driving force favoring Ca®+* entry ; membrane depolarization would reduce this driving force .
By direct measurement during perforated-patch current-clamp recording , we found that progesterone depolarizes the membrane potential , E , , .
Ky channels normally maintain the resting membrane potential of T lymphocytes near -60 mV ( 38 ) .
Fig .
4 A illustrates that membrane hyperpolarization accompanies TG stimulation ( from -61 + 1.2 mV , n = 3 ; to -78 + 2.0 mV , r = 11 ) .
The hyperpolarization that follows TG stimulation is produced by activation of Kc , channels during the rise in driving FE , , towards the K+ equilibrium potential of ~-80 mV .
Progesterone ( 50 M ; application bar , Fig .
4 A ) not only reversed the hyperpolarization , but also resulted in depolarization to an average of -41 + 4.3 mV ( n = 13 , P < 0.0001 ) .
These results suggest that progesterone may block both Ky and K.. , channels .
If the reduction of [ Ca # ®+ ] ; by progesterone is secondary to decreased K* current , then restoration of a K* flux across the cell membrane should reverse this effect of progesterone .
We tested this hypothesis by using the K* ionophore , valinomycin , to hyperpolarize E , , .
In the experiment shown in Fig .
4 B , 30 wM progesterone reduced the plateau in [ C+ ] ; that followed TG stimulation .
The subsequent addition of valinomycin in the continued presence of progesterone resulted in an increase of [ Ca '' + ] ; .
Thus , Ca**+-imaging and current-clamp experiments demonstrate that progesterone reduces the driving force for Ca*+* entry , an effect that can be reversed by reestablishing K* efflux .
These data suggest that progesterone may affect [ Ca '' +* ] ; and gene expression by blocking K* channels .
Progesterone Blocks Voltage-gated K* and C & * -activated K+ Channels in T Cells : Whole-cell recording with the patch-clamp technique permits direct measurement of several types of channel activity in T cells A voltage step from a holding potential of -80 to +30 mV elicits rapidly activating Ky currents , which reach a peak and then slowly inacti-vate .
K , , currents consist of two components , a predominant fraction encoded by homotetramers of the Shaker-related Kvl.3 gene and a much smaller fraction of unknown molecular identity ( for a review , see reference 24 ) .
The two components can be readily distinguished by their biophysical and pharmacological properties Kv1l.3 channels are blocked by nanomolar concentrations of a scorpion toxin , charybdotoxin ( CTX ) , and undergo cumulative ( use-dependent ) C-type inactivation during repetitive de-polarization .
The smaller , CT X-resistant current does not exhibit use-dependent inactivation .
Application of progesterone rapidly and reversibly reduces Ky currents in human or B3Z T cells , with an IC , , of 29 + 2 wM for the peak K* current ( Fig .
5 ) .
Progesterone accelerates the decline of K* current during a depolarizing pulse , and thus the block Figure 3 .

Subsequent application of 50 M progesterone depolarized the cell to -26 mV , resulting in a reduction of the driving force for Ca* influx .
For perforated-patch recordings , the tips of the pipettes were filled with the following solution ( in mM ) : 120 K , SO4 , 16 KCI , 5 MgSO , , 10 Hepes ( pH 7.2 ) .
A stock solution of nystatin in DMSO ( 25 g/ ml ) was prepared daily and subsequently diluted in the pipette solution to a final concentration of 100 g/ ml .
After sonication , this solution was used for backfilling the pipettes as described previously ( reference 31 ) .

The apparent increased rate of channel inactivation ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) suggests that progesterone may preferentially bind to and block the open or inactivated Kyv1.3 channel .
To determine if steady-state inactivation enhances the block by progesterone , we inactivated a significant fraction of Kv1.3 channels by decreasing the holding potential from -80 to -50 mV .
As shown in Fig .

In the presence of progesterone , Kvl.3 currents steadily declined during repetitive pulsing , because channel inactivation recovers 10-fold more slowly , resulting in accumulation of channels in the inactivated state ( Fig .

We also examined the effects of progesterone on the smaller component of Ky current by selectively blocking the Kv1.3 component with 100 nM CTX .

However , in 11 cells examined in this series of experiments and in previous work ( 21 ) , 5-20 % of the K , , current remains in the presence of CTX .
This residual CT X-resistant current does not undergo use-dependent inactivation during repetitive depolarizing pulses ( Fig .
7 A ) .
Fig .
7 B demonstrates that the larger , use-dependent , CT X-sensitive component of Ky current is blocked either by progesterone or by RU 486 .
As shown in Fig .
7 C , most of the CTX-resistant current is also blocked by 50 M progesterone , whereas RU 486 at the same concentration is less effective .
We conclude that progesterone blocks both the predominant Kv1.3 component and the CTX-resistant component of Ky current in T cells , and that RU 486 blocks primarily the Kv1.3 component .
K. , channels hyperpolarize the membrane potential of T cells during the [ Ca+ ] ; signal , effectively counteracting the depolarizing effects of influx .
K , channels are volt-age-independent and highly sensitive to a rise in [ C¥ # + ] ; , with half-activation at ~400 nM and a steep [ Ca '' +* ] ; de-pendence , suggesting that at least four Ca®* ions must bind to open the channel ( for a review , see reference 24 ) .
Based upon biophysical characterization and its expression in T cells , it is likely that the K , , channel in T cells is encoded by the gene hKCa4 ( 39 ) .
Intracellular dialysis of B3Z or ac 1598 tivated human T cells with solutions containing 1 pM Ca®+ activated a large K* current that was evident in voltage ramps ( Fig .
8 A ) .
Progesterone blocked K. , channels with an IC ; , value of 113 + 9 mM ( Fig .
8 B ) .
Thus , progesterone blocks the Ky currents more potently than the K , currents in T cells In contrast , the progesterone antagonist RU 486 was consistently more potent than progesterone in blocking Ky , current ( Fig .
8 C ) .
These experiments demonstrate some degree of selectivity of the two components of Ky current and the K , current for progesterone and RU 486 .
Selectivity of Progesterone for K , Channels : Progesterone Does Not Block CRAC or Chloride Channels in T Cells The results from patch-clamp experiments suggested that progesterone , RU 486 , and perhaps other steroid hormones might block several K* channel types , albeit with rather low affinity .
Therefore , we screened a panel of steroids on the Ky and Kc , channels in T lymphocytes .
Most of the compounds tested either had no effect or were less effective than progesterone in blocking Ky or Kq , currents ( Table 1 ) .
In addition , we screened several channel types , including both cloned and native channels expressed in a variety of cell lines , for block by progesterone , as summarized in Table 2 .

The nominal free C* concentration of this solution was 1 pM , assuming a dissociation constant for EGTA and Ca* of 107 '' at pH 7.2 .
Ca®*-activated K* currents were evoked by voltage ramps of 200-ms duration from -120 to +50 mV every 30 s. Application of progesterone at different concentrations ( indi-cated at the right of each trace ) inhibited the Kc , current .

including Kv1.3 expressed in lymphocytes as the predominant Ky current , as well as Kv3.1 expressed in the brain and in certain subsets of mouse thymocytes .
In contrast , progesterone had very little effect on a cloned voltage-gated Nat channel found in skeletal muscle , or on a strongly inward rectifying K* channel found in RBL cells We conclude that progesterone is a broad spectrum , low-affinity K* channel blocker .
In further experiments on Jurkat T lymphocytes , we evaluated effects of progesterone on CR AC and CI- channels to determine if modulation of these channel types might contribute to the inhibition of Ca®* signaling .
During whole-cell patch-clamp recordings , intracellular dialysis with heavily buffered low-Ca '' + solutions passively depleted the intracellular Ca+ stores and activated CRAC channels ( Fig .
9 A ) .
After maximal activation , 30 pM progesterone ( Fig .
9 B , application bar ) had no effect on the amplitude or the current-voltage characteristics ( n = 6 cells ) .
This experiment rules out direct CRAC channel block as a possible contributor to the inhibition of C # + signaling by progesterone ; instead , it appears that progesterone blocks Ca®* signaling by inhibiting K+ channels , indirectly reducing the driving force for Ca®* entry .
CI- channels have also been implicated in lymphocyte signaling mechanisms by helping to maintain E , , during T cell acti- Table 2 .

However , superfusion of B3Z or Jurkat cells with 50 M progesterone did not affect the amplitude or the current-voltage characteristics of CI- currents induced by cell swelling ( Fig .
9 , C and D ) .
Discussion In this report , we demonstrate by patch-clamp measurement that progesterone directly blocks Ky and K. , channels , but not Ca*®+* or CI- channels in T lymphocytes .
Furthermore , we show that K* channel blockade is associated with membrane depolarization , inhibition of Ca* signaling , and a reduction of NF-AT-driven gene expression .
Since NF- AT links activation of the TCR to IL-2 produc-tion , interruption of these signals would inhibit production of the major proliferative cytokine for T cells We propose that K* channel blockade provides a mechanism contributing to the immunosuppressive effects of progesterone .
The rapid onset and reversibility of Ky channel block by progesterone is incompatible with changes in mRNA or protein synthesis , suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the classical steroid receptor pathway ( 40 ) .
The progesterone antagonist RU 486 is nearly as potent as progesterone in blocking both Ky channels and gene ex-pression , also implicating a nongenomic action of proges- Cloned channels Gene Kyvl.1 Kyvl.2 Kv1.3 Kv1.4 KyvI1.5 Kv3.1 hSKM1 Cell type L929 NGK1 L929 LTK MEL L929 HEK 31 + 6 45 + 10 44 + 9 23 + 8 25 + 2 53 +3 11 + 1 Native channels Channel Ky Ky Ky ( CTX ) Koa CRAC CI- Kir Cell type Human T B3Z Human T Human T , act .

Furthermore , channel inactivation enhances block by progesterone , suggesting that the state of the channel modulates the affinity of progesterone .
In T cells , the direct block of Ky channels by dihydroquinolines and benzhydryl piperidines is also enhanced by inactivation ( 41 , 42 ) .
In addition , progesterone blocks Kv1l.3 channels exogenously expressed in a cell line ( Table 2 ) .
Progesterone also blocks other Ky and Kc , channels with low affinity .
These data suggest that progesterone blocks K+ channels directly , rather than acting via the classical nuclear progesterone receptor pathway .
Channel blockade by progesterone is not without prece- 1600 dent .
Previous studies demonstrated that progesterone blocks voltage-gated Ca*®+ channels in smooth muscle cells and a variety of K+ channels in MDCK cells and hepato-cytes ( 43-45 ) .
Several transmitter-activated channels are also suppressed by progesterone in the micromolar concentration range ( 46-49 ) .
In contrast to its effects on somatic cells , progesterone activates Ca®+* influx in sperm ( 50 , 51 ) .
We found no evidence for progesterone-induced Ca** influx in T cells .
Our data provide the first evidence that an endogenous hormone may act as an immunosuppressant by blocking K* channels .
Inhibition of K* channels has been shown to reduce IL-2 production and T cell activation in vitro ( 22 , 23 , 52 ) .
Moreover , recent studies demonstrated that the peptide scorpion toxin margatoxin , a specific blocker of Kyv1.3 channels , inhibits delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and reduces response to allogeneic challenge in vivo ( 25 ) .
The depolarization and reduction of the driving force for Ca®+ entry resulting from K+ channel inhibition are sufficient to account for the reduction of Ca # * signals and NF-AT-driven gene expression .
CRAC channels are inwardly rectifying , and a modest depolarization can reduce Ca '' ®* entry significantly , reducing the rise in below the threshold for gene expression ( for a review , see reference 24 ) .
At high concentrations , progesterone reduces Ca®+ signaling and gene expression almost to control levels , below a plateau level seen with 100 nM CTX ( 21 , 53 , and data not shown ) .
Progesterone , although acting with low affinity , may reduce Ca®* signaling and gene expression to a greater extent than CTX because progesterone also inhibits CTX-resistant Ky channels The block of K* channels by progesterone or RU 486 can also account for previous results showing that progesterone or RU 486 inhibits activation of human T cells in vitro ( 8 , 9 ) , as well as the reduction of the number of CD3* cells in the placenta compared with maternal blood ( 11 , 54 ) .
During pregnancy , immunoregulatory mechanisms must operate locally at the placental interface and be readily reversible to preserve the systemic immune competence of the mother .
Several mechanisms involving progesterone may contribute to fetal-maternal protection , including altered expression of MHC class I proteins in fetal tissue , altered T cell subsets , or elaboration of immunosuppressive factors ( 2 ) .
Biochemical measurements have estimated progesterone concentrations to be 20 uM within the placenta ( 34 , 35 ) ; concentrations in the vicinity of trophoblasts producing progesterone must be even higher .
Average progesterone levels found in the placenta would be sufficient to block lymphocyte K* channels and thereby mediate a highly localized and reversible immunosuppression without compromising the maternal immune system .
The affinity of progesterone for K* channels ensures that this mechanism would only be effective in the region of potential contact between allogeneic cells , where progesterone is present at high concentrations .
