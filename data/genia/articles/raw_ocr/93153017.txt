Ganchi , Shao-Cong Sun , Warner C. Greene , and Dean W. Ballard* Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco General Hospital , California 94141-9100 Submitted August 14 , 1992 ; Accepted September 23 , 1992 The active nuclear form of the NF- « B transcription factor complex is composed of two DNA binding subunits , NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 , both of which share extensive N-terminal sequence homology with the v-rel oncogene product .
The NF- « B p65 subunit provides the transactivation activity in this complex and serves as an intracellular receptor for a cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF- « B , termed IkB .
In contrast , NF- « B p50 alone fails to stimulate « B-directed transcription , and based on prior in vitro studies , is not directly regulated by IkB .
To investigate the molecular basis for the critical regulatory interaction between NF- « B and IxB/MAD-3 , a series of human NF- « B p65 mutants was identified that functionally segregated DNA binding , IxB-mediated inhibition , and IxB-induced nuclear exclusion of this transcription factor .
Results from in vivo expression studies performed with these NF- « B p65 mutants revealed the following : 1 ) IxB/MAD-3 completely inhibits NF- « B p65-dependent transcriptional activation mediated through the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 « B enhancer in human T lymphocytes , 2 ) the binding of I « B/MAD-3 to NF- « B p65 is sufficient to retarget NF- « B p65 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , 3 ) selective deletion of the functional nuclear localization signal present in the Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 disrupts its ability to engage IxB/MAD-3 , and 4 ) the unique C-terminus of NF- « B p65 attenuates its own nuclear localization and contains sequences that are required for IxB-mediated inhibition of NF- « B p65 DNA binding activity .
Together , these findings suggest that the nuclear localization signal and transactivation domain of NF- « B p65 constitute a bipartite system that is critically involved in the inhibitory function of I « B/MAD-3 .
Unexpectedly , our in vivo studies also demonstrate that IxB/MAD-3 binds directly to NF- « B p50 .
This interaction is functional as it leads to retargeting of NF- « B p50 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm .
However , no loss of DNA binding activity is observed , presumably reflecting the unique C-terminal domain that is distinct from that present in NF- « B p65 .
INTRODUCTION During the development of a normal immune response , the clonal expansion of activated CD4* T lymphocytes is tightly controlled by the transient transcriptional in * Corresponding author and present address : Dean W.

Both of these growth-related genes contain promoter-proximal regulatory sequences that serve as functional binding sites for NF- « B ( Bohnlein et al. , 1988 ; Hoyos et al. , 1989 ) , a heterodimeric transcription factor that is rapidly trans-located from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell 1339 P.A .

activation ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986a , b ; Lenardo and Baltimore , 1989 ) .
Like these inducible cellular transcription units , the 5 ' long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ' of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) contains two tandem NF- « B binding sites that have been implicated in the capacity of this pathogenic retrovirus to respond to a variety of immunomodulatory signals that normally lead to T-cell activation ( Kaufman et al. , 1987 ; Muesing et al. , 1987 ; Nabel and Baltimore , 1987 ; Siek-evitz et al. , 1987 ; Tong-Starksen et al. , 1987 ) .
Thus , NF- « B represents one critical host transcription factor involved not only in normal T-cell activation and growth but also in governing the initial activation of HIV-1 gene expression in virally-infected CD4* T lymphocytes ( Greene et al. , 1989 ) .
Biochemical ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ) and molecular cloning ( Ghosh et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Ruben et al. , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ) studies indicate that the heterodimeric NF- « B complex found in the nucleus of activated T cells is comprised of at least two DNA binding subunits , termed NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 .
Both of these subunits share significant N-terminal amino acid sequence homology ( ~300 amino acids ) with the v-Rel oncoprotein , its cellular counterpart ( c-Rel ) , and the dorsal gene product , a maternal morphogen in Drosophila ( Gilmore , 1990 , and references therein ) .
Notably , the NF- « B p65 subunit exhibits two unique biologic activities that are integral to the function and regulation of the NF- « B complex .
First , NF- « B p65 , unlike NF- « B p50 , contains a strong C-terminal transactivation domain that is essential for efficient transcription directed from the HIV-1 « kB enhancer ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ; Ruben et al. , 1992b ) .
Second , this subunit acts as an intracellular receptor for I « B , a specific cytoplasmic inhibitor that appears critically involved in the regulation of NF- « B shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell activation ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1988a , b ; Molitor et al. , 1990 ; Urban and Baeuerle , 1990 ) .
In contrast to the positive transcriptional effects exerted by NF- « B p65 , comparative studies with NF- « B p50 have suggested that it primarily serves to augment the DNA binding affinity of the heterodimeric NF- « B p65/p50 complex ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ) .
It also has been reported that the homodimeric form of NF- « B p50 acts as a physiologic repressor of « B-dependent transcription ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ; Kang et al. , 1992 ) .
Furthermore , despite its extensive N-terminal sequence homology with NF- « B p65 , the DNA binding activity of NF- « B p50 is not subject ' Abbreviations used : CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; FCS , fetal calf serum ; HEPES , N-2-hydroxyethylpi-perazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ; HIV-1 , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ; HTLV-1 , human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ; LTR , long terminal repeat ; NLS , nuclear localization signal ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; PBS , phosphate-buffered saline ; PKA , protein kinase A ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate .
1340 to IxB-mediated inhibition in vitro ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Zabel and Baeuerle , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Inoue et al. , 1992b ) .
Instead , it appears that NF- « B p50 is expressed as an inactive 110-kDa precursor polypeptide whose DNA binding potential is regulated via proteolytic processing to remove an inhibitory C-terminal domain ( Ghosh et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ) .
Although the transactivation and IxB binding properties of NF- « B p65 are clearly distinct from those of NF- « B p50 , the molecular mechanism underlying IxB-mediated inhibition of NF- « B function specifically through the NF- « B p65 subunit ( Urban and Baeuerle , 1990 ) remains unknown .
In this regard , long-range deletion mapping studies with in vitro synthesized proteins suggest that the N-terminal Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 contains structural determinants essential for its regulation by I « B ( Nolan et al. , 1991 ) .
To define precisely this critical regulatory interaction in a more physiologic setting , we have analyzed the biochemical properties of a series of in vivo synthesized NF- « B p65 variants after transfection of the corresponding cDNA expression vectors in monkey COS cells .
These studies clearly demonstrate that NF- « B p65 contains two domains that function in concert to mediate assembly with I « B/MAD-3 , resulting in the inhibition of NF- « B p65 DNA binding activity .
Specifically , one major subregion of NF- « B p65 critically involved in I « B/MAD-3 binding corresponds to the functional nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) within the Rel homology domain .
In addition , the C-terminal transactivation domain of NF- « B p65 is required for IxB-mediated inhibition of DNA binding but is completely dispensible for the assembly of NF- « B p65 with I « B/MAD-3 .
Surprisingly , I « B/MAD-3 also binds to and regulates the subcellular distribution of the structurally related NF- « B p50 subunit in the absence of NF- « B p65 .
Together , these findings suggest that IxB/ MAD-3 prevents the nuclear translocation of NF- « B by directly masking the NLS of either of these integral Rel-related subunits .
However , the selective inhibition of NF- « B p65 DNA binding occurs through a more complex interaction involving the unique C-terminus of this transactivator .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression Vectors and Reporter Plasmids All human NF- « B p65 ( Ruben et al. , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ) , NF- « B p50 ( amino acids 1-461 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ) , and IxB/MAD-3 ( Haskill et al. , 1991 ) cDNAs were subcloned within the polylinker sequences of the pCMV4 expression vector ( Andersson et al. , 1989 ) downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter .
Carboxy- and amino-terminal deletion mutants were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction from a template corresponding to the full-length human NF- « B p65 cDNA ( Ruben et al. , 1991 ) .
Oligonucleotide primers used in these reactions were designed to incorporate a consensus translational initiation sequence ( Kozak , 1987 ) , an in-frame stop codon , and unique restriction sites to facilitate directional cloning into pCMV4 .
Specific site-directed mutations were introduced into the full-length NF- « B p65 cDNA using the phosphorothioate method and oligonu- Molecular Biology of the Cell cleotide primers that introduced diagnostic restriction sites ( Nakamaye and Eckstein , 1986 ) .
The Tax expression vector has been described previously ( Rimsky et al. , 1988 ) .
Reporter plasmids contained either the full-length type 1 human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-1 ) LTR ( Sodroski et al. , 1985 ) or the HIV-1 « B enhancer cassette linked to a heterologous TATA box ( Stein et al. , 1989 ) , cloned immediately upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene .
COS Cell Transfections and Extract Preparations The COS monkey kidney cell line was maintained in Iscove 's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 2 mM glutamine , and antibiotics .
One day before transfection , cells were seeded in 0.1 % gelatin-treated six-well plates ( 3 X 10° cells/well ) .
Plasmid DNA was transfected using the DEAE-dextran method ( Holbrook et al. , 1987 ) .
Briefly , adherent cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , incubated with 0.5 ml of DNA cocktail ( 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran and 2.5 ug/ml plasmid DNA in PBS ) for 30 min at 37°C , followed by the addition of 4.5 ml of Iscoves medium containing 100 aM chlo-roquine .
Cells were then incubated for an additional 2.5 h at 37°C .
The medium was aspirated , and the cells were treated with 10 % di-methyl sulfoxide for 2.5 min at room temperature .
At 48-60 h after transfection , some cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium lacking cysteine and methionine and then radiolabeled for 2 h with and [ *SJmethionine ( 150 each ) .
Whole-cell extracts were prepared under low-stringency conditions by lysis with ELB buffer ( 50 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] , pH 7.0 , 250 mM NaCl , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , 5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 1.0 mM phenyl-fluoride ) supplemented with a previously described protease inhibitor cocktail ( Ballard et al. , 1990 ) .
After a 10-min incubation at 4°C , lysed cells were centrifuged at 37 000 x g for 15 min .
Clarified supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until used .
DNA Binding Studies `` P-radiolabeled kB DNA probes were prepared by annealing a 27-base coding strand template ( 5-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCC-CTCTCCTT-3 ' , « B-pd ) to a complementary 10-base primer ( 5'-AAG-GAGAGGG-3 ' ) and filling in the resultant overhang using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [ a-* '' '' P ] JdATP , [ « - '' P ] dCTP , dGTP , and dTTP ( Ballard et al. , 1989 ) .
DNA binding reactions ( 20 ul ) contained 4 al of COS cell extract ( ~0.5 mg/ml ) and 0.2 ug of double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) buffered in 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , and 5 mM DTT ( Ballard et al. , 1989 ) .
Approximately 10 fmol of P-labeled probe ( 200 000 cpm ) was used per reaction .
After incubating the reactions at room temperature for 25 min , the resultant nucleoprotein complexes were resolved on a native 5 % polyacrylamide gel as previously described ( Bohnlein et al. , 1988 ) .
Immunoprecipitation Analysis Rabbit antisera were prepared ( Immunodynamics , La Jolla , CA ) against carrier-conjugated peptides corresponding to unique terminal sequences present in NF- « B p65 ( amino acids 1-21 and amino acids 535-551 ) ( Ruben et al. , 1991 ) , NF- « B p50 ( amino acids 1-21 ) ( Kieran et al. , 1990 ) , and IxB/MAD-3 ( amino acids 1-29 ) ( Haskill ef al. , 1991 ) .
For immunoprecipitation studies , 1 Ll of the appropriate antipeptide antiserum was mixed with 100 ul of precleared `` S-labeled COS extract and 400 Ll of ELB buffer .
Antibody binding reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4°C and then supplemented with 10 ul ( packed volume ) of protein A-agarose ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Solid-phase immune complexes were washed three times with 500 ul of ice-cold ELB buffer , boiled in the presence of 4 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 5 % B-mercaptoethanol , 8 M urea , and fractionated on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels .

Western Blot Analysis Protein samples ( ~3.5 ug ) were separated on 8.75 % polyacrylamide gels followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes .
Membranes were incubated in 5 % dry milk in PBS/0.1 % Tween 20 to inhibit nonspecific protein binding and then sequentially incubated with an appropriate dilution of specific rabbit antiserum ( 1 h ) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig ( Amersham ; 1:2500 dilution in PBS/0.1 % Tween 20 ) .
Membranes were washed extensively with PBST after each of the incubation steps .
Specific immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence as specified by the manufacturer ( ECL Western Blotting Kit ; Amer-sham ) .
Indirect Immunofluorescence COS cells were seeded on four-well chamber slides ( Nunc , Naperville , IL ) and transfected using the DEAE-dextran method .
After 48 h , the cells were rinsed once with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 3 % parafor-maldehyde/10 % FCS in PBS .
After rinsing twice with PBS , the cells were incubated with the primary rabbit antiserum ( diluted in PBS/ 10 % FCS ) for 1 h at room temperature , followed by three 5-min washes with PBS .
The cells were then incubated for 1 h with the Texas red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG ( Amersham ; 1:500 dilution in PBS/10 % FCS ) .
After washing four times in PBS , the slides were mounted in Gel/Mount ( Biomeda , Foster City , CA ) and photographed using an immunofluorescent microscope ( Diaplan ; Leitz , Wetzlar , W. Germany ) .
Jurkat T-Cell Transfections and CAT Assays The human T-cell line , Jurkat , was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM glutamine , and antibiotics .
Plasmid DNA was introduced into cells using DEAE-dextran ( Holbrook et al. , 1987 ) .
Jurkat cells ( 5 X 10° ) were incubated in 250 Ll of a 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran solution containing 10 ug of plasmid DNA for 30 min at 37°C .
Sub-sequently , 5 ml of RPMI containing 100 aM chloroquine was added , and the incubation continued for another 30 min at 37°C .
Cell extracts were normalized for protein recovery ( Bradford , 1976 ) and assayed for CAT activity 48 h posttransfection using the diffusion-based liquid scintillation counting method described by Neumann et al .
( 1987 ) .
RESULTS NF- « B p65-Mediated Activation of the HIV-1 « B Enhancer in Human T Lymphocytes is Inhibited by IxB/MAD-3 Biochemical reconstitution studies have suggested that the NF- « B p65/p50 heterodimer is functionally sequestered as a latent complex in the cytoplasm of resting T lymphocytes via specific protein-protein interactions between IxB and as yet undefined sequences within the N-terminal Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 ( Figure 1A ) ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Molitor et al. , 1990 ; Urban and Baeuerle , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ) .
Based on in vitro assays , the cytoplasmic form of NF- « B is likely released from IxB after phosphorylation of the inhibitor , thereby allowing the rapid translocation of NF- « B p65 to its nuclear site of action ( Ghosh and Baltimore , 1990 ; Kerr et al. , 1991 ) .
Recently , Haskill et al .
( 1991 ) have isolated a human cDNA clone ( IxB/MAD-3 ) encoding a 34- to 37-kDa polypeptide that inhibits 1341 P.A .

The transactivation function of NF- « B p65 is regulated by IxB/MAD-3 in vivo .
( A ) Primary domain structure of NF- « B p65 .
The N-terminal Rel homology domain ( shaded ) of NF- « B p65 , which contains two highly conserved motifs , a basic tetrapeptide nuclear localization signal ( NLS/KRKR ) , and a protein kinase A phosphorylation consensus sequence ( PKA/RRPS ) , is shown in conjunction with the C-terminal transactivation domain ( black ) and the `` mini-leucine zipper '' motif ( MLZ ; hatched ) .
The endpoints of specific N- and C-terminal NF- « B p65 truncation mutants used throughout this study are indicated .
( B ) Expression of C-terminally truncated NF- « B p65 mutants .
Monkey COS cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran with cDNA expression vectors encoding either wild-type IxB/MAD-3 ( lane 6 ) , wild-type NF- « B p65 ( lane 1 ) , or C-terminal truncation mutants of NF- « B p65 containing the indicated N- and C-terminal endpoints ( lanes 2-5 ) .
Recipient cells were metabolically labeled with [ *SJcysteine at 48 h posttransfection , and the corresponding extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antipeptide antiserum specific for either NF- « B p65 ( amino acids 1-21 ; lanes 1-5 ) or IxB/MAD-3 ( amino acids 1-29 ; lane 6 ) .
( C ) I « B/MAD-3 specifically inhibits NF- « B p65-dependent transactivation .
Human Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with the indicated wild-type and truncated NF- « B p65 expression vectors , along with a CAT reporter plasmid containing the HIV-1 « B enhancer ( « B-TATA-CAT ) in the presence ( C ) ) or absence ( ® ) of an I « B/MAD-3 expression vector .
In control transfections ( right ) , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with an HTLV-1 Tax expression vector and a CAT reporter plasmid linked to the full-length HTLV-1 LTR .
CAT activities were measured after 48 h of culture and are presented as the relative fold-induction over basal levels obtained with unmodified pCMV4 expression vector alone .
the DNA binding activity of NF- « B in vitro .
The predicted primary structure of this human inhibitor protein is also fully consistent with the partial amino acid sequence determined for purified rabbit I « B ( Davis et al. , 1991 ) .
However , the intracellular biologic effects of IxB/ MAD-3 on NF- « B-dependent transcription remain unexamined .
Transient transfection studies have revealed that NF- « B p65 , but not NF- « B p50 , contains unique C-terminal sequences ( amino acids 451-551 ) ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ; Ruben et al. , 1992b ) that are critical for activation of « B-directed transcription ( Figure 1A ) .
To investigate whether IxB/MAD-3 specifically regulates the transactivation function of NF- « B p65 in vivo , a series of C-terminally truncated cDNAs were constructed that encode stable NF- « B p65 variants lacking progressively larger portions of the C-terminal transactivation domain ( Figure 1B ) .
Jurkat human T cells were then cotransfected with recombinant expression 1342 vectors containing these truncated cDNAs and an HIV-1 « B-CAT reporter plasmid ( « B-TATA-CAT ) in the presence or absence of an expression vector encoding the 37-kDa human I « B/MAD-3 protein ( Figure 1B ) .
As shown in Figure 1C , coexpression of « B-TATA-CAT with full-length NF- « B p65 ( p65 WT ) potently stimulated « B-directed transcription ( ~15-fold ) relative to the levels observed with unmodified pCMV4 expression vector .
As expected ( Ballard et al. , 1992 ) , deletion of the C-terminal 101 amino acids ( amino acids 451-551 ) of NF- « B p65 disrupted the transcriptional activity observed with the wild-type NF- « B p65 protein .
More im-portantly , coexpression of I « B/MAD-3 with functionally active members of this deletion series completely abolished NF- « B p65-mediated transcription .
In addition , specific deletion of a ' '' mini-leucine zipper '' motif located immediately adjacent to the primary transactivation domain ( see Figure 1A ) , which is required for optimal NF- « B p65 activity ( Ruben et al. , 1992b ) , did not sig- Molecular Biology of the Cell nificantly affect the ability of IxB/MAD-3 to inhibit NF-kB p65-induced transcription ( Figure 1C ) .
In contrast , IxB/MAD-3 failed to significantly block Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of the HTLV-1 LTR , a response that proceeds independently of the NF- « B/Rel transcription factor pathway ( Paskalis et al. , 1986 ; Shimo-tohno et al. , 1986 ; Brady et al. , 1987 ; Smith and Greene , 1990 ) .
These studies thus demonstrate that IxB/MAD-3 functions as a potent inhibitor of NF- « B p65 in vivo , presumably by a mechanism involving the proposed ability of IxB/MAD-3 to retain NF- « B in the cytoplasm ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1988a , b ) .
IxB/MAD-3 Regulates the Nuclear Expression of Both NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 but Blocks the DNA Binding Activity of Only NF- « B p65 The previous finding that the Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 is involved in its interaction with IxB ( Nolan et al. , 1991 ) raised the possibility that homologous sequences present in the N-terminal half of NF- « B p50 might also interact with I « xB .
To determine the relative effects of IxB/MAD-3 on the DNA binding activity of NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 , extracts from COS cells overexpressing each of these subunits , either in the absence or presence of IxB/MAD-3 , were tested in gel retardation assays using a *P-labeled kB enhancer probe .
As shown in Figure 2A , in vivo synthesized forms of both subunits bound to this « B enhancer probe in the absence of I « xB/MAD-3 , leading to the formation of distinct nucleoprotein complexes ( lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Whereas coexpression of IxB/MAD-3 with NF- « B p65 completely blocked NF- « B p65 DNA binding activity ( lane 2 ) , coexpression of IxB/MAD-3 with NF- « B p50 failed to inhibit the formation of NF- « B p50/ « B enhancer complexes ( lane 4 ) .
These in vivo data are thus fully consistent with previous NF- « B DNA binding studies performed using in vitro synthesized proteins ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Zabel and Baeuerle , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Inoue et al. , 1992b ) .
These findings indicate that NF- « B p65 contains sequences required for IxB-mediated inhibition of DNA binding that are not found in NF- « B p50 .
However , these findings do not exclude the possibility that I « B/MAD-3 binds to NF- « B p50 , even though it fails to block its DNA binding activity .
To directly compare the relative IxB/MAD-3 binding capacities of NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 , coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed with subunit-specific antipeptide antisera using *°S-labeled extracts from transfected COS cells .
As shown in Figure 2B , the NF- « B p65-specific antiserum immunoprecipitated a major 65- to 72-kDa polypeptide in extracts from COS cells transfected with the wild-type NF- « B p65 expression vector ( lane 1 ) .
Coexpression of IxB/MAD-3 with NF- « B p65 in these recipient cells resulted in the detection of a second major polypeptide of 35-40 kDa ( lane 2 ) , which is consistent with the molecular weight reported Vol .

The relative positions and sizes ( in kilodaltons ) of molecular weight markers are given on the left .

for human IxB/MAD-3 ( Haskill et al. , 1991 ) .
This protein was also readily detected with anti-MAD-3 antiserum ( Ganchi et al. , unpublished results ) .
In reciprocal antibody binding studies with extracts from NF- « B p50-transfected COS cells , the NF- « B p50-specific antiserum immunoprecipitated a 48- to 55-kDa polypeptide ( lane 3 ) , consistent with the predicted size of this Rel-related subunit .
Surprisingly , despite the inability of I « B/MAD-3 to block NF- « B p50 DNA binding activity ( Figure 2A , lane 4 ) , IxB/MAD-3 was readily detected in immunoprecipitates from COS cells coexpressing these polypeptides ( Figure 2B , lane 4 ) .
These findings thus demonstrate the unexpected capacity of IxB/MAD-3 and NF- « B p50 to form stable complexes in vivo .
Studies were next performed to examine whether IxB/ MAD-3 modulated the subcellular distribution of NF- « B p50 and NF- « B p65 ( Figure 2C ) .
Immunofluorescent staining of COS cells expressing NF- « B p65 with specific anti-NF- « B p65 antiserum revealed a diffuse , predominantly perinuclear , or whole-cell pattern of fluorescence ( Figure 2C , a ) .
In contrast , coexpression of I « B/MAD-3 with NF- « B p65 yielded a nuclear-excluded distribution of NF- « B p65 ( Figure 2C , c ) .
When NF- « B p50-expressing COS cells were probed with an NF- « B p50-specific antiserum , a primarily nuclear pattern of expression was 1344 observed ( Figure 2C , b ) .
However , consistent with the capacity of NF- « B p50 to engage Ix « B/MAD-3 , this immunoreactive species was completely retargeted to the cytoplasm after coexpression with IxB/MAD-3 ( Figure 2C , d ) .
These results demonstrate that I « B/MAD-3 is capable of regulating the subcellular localization of the homodimeric forms of both NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 .
The Transactivation Domain of NF- « B p65 is Selectively Required for IxB-Mediated Inhibition of DNA Binding but not for IxB/MAD-3 Binding To determine the NF- « B p65 sequences required for IxB-mediated inhibition of DNA binding activity , the C-terminal deletion series of NF- « B p65 mutants were examined for DNA binding ( Figure 3A ) , inhibition of binding by IxB/MAD-3 ( Figure 3B ) , and stable association with IxB/MAD-3 ( Figure 3C ) after transfection in COS cells .
In gel retardation assays , extracts from COS cells transfected with the wild-type NF- « B p65 cDNA supported the formation of a single nucleoprotein complex ( Figure 3A , lane 2 ) that was absent in DNA-binding reactions performed using control extracts prepared from cells transfected with the parental pCMV4 expression vector ( lane 1 ) .
Deletion of the unique C-terminal Molecular Biology of the Cell non-Rel sequences of NF- « B p65 , which encompass the principal transactivation domain ( see Figure 1A ) ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ) , modestly enhanced the overall DNA binding activity of NF- « B p65 ( Figure 3 , lanes 5-8 ) .
These results are consistent with the earlier observations of Nolan et al .
( 1991 ) , suggesting that these C-terminal sequences intrinsically attenuate the DNA binding activity of NF- « B p65 .
Deletion to amino acid 291 , which removes a basic stretch of residues ( KRKR ; amino acids 301-304 ; see Figure 1A ) resembling the functional nuclear localization signal present in NF- « B p50 ( Henkel et al. , 1992 ) , also had no negative effect on DNA binding ( lane 8 ) .
However , removal of three additional amino acids to residue 288 completely disrupted DNA binding activity ( lane 9 ) , thus mapping the C-terminal boundary of the NF- « B p65 DNA binding domain to between amino acids 289 and 291 within the Rel homology domain .
In parallel experiments , this series of NF- « B p65 C-terminal deletion mutants was coexpressed in COS cells with an equivalent amount of an IxB/MAD-3 expression vector .
Results from gel retardation studies performed with extracts from these cotransfected cells are shown in Figure 3B .
Consistent with prior in vitro reconstitution studies ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Urban and Baeuerle , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Ruben et al. , 1991 ) , coexpression of wild-type NF- « B p65 with I « B/MAD-3 in vivo completely blocked « B enhancer binding activity ( lane 2 ) .
Similar inhibitory effects were observed with an NF- « B p65 mutant lacking the C-terminal 51 amino acids ( lane 3 ) .
However , removal of all of the primary NF- « B p65 transactivation domain ( amino acids 451-551 ; see Figure 1A ) ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ) yielded an NF- « B p65 mutant that was entirely refractory to IxB-mediated inhibition ( lane 4 ) .
Similarly , NF- « B p65 mutants terminated between amino acids 291 and 312 ( lanes 5-8 ) retained DNA binding activity when coexpressed with an equivalent amount of the I « xB/MAD-3 expression vector .
Subsequent titration experiments performed with the latter NF- « B truncation mutant revealed significant inhibitory effects on DNA binding activity only at higher ( at least 4:1 vector ratio ) doses of IkB/MAD-3 ( Ganchi et al. , unpublished results ) .
These surprising results suggest that the C-terminal activation domain of NF- « B p65 is required for IxB-mediated inhibition of NF- « B p65 DNA binding .
The precise subregion ( s ) within NF- « B p65 required for IxB/MAD-3 binding in vivo remains unknown .
To determine these requisite sequences , COS cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding IxB/ MAD-3 and each of the NF- « B p65 C-terminal deletion mutants .
These cell were then metabolically radiolabeled and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with specific antipeptide antiserum raised against the N-terminus of NF- « B p65 .
As shown in Figure 3C , this antiserum specifically immunoprecipitated a 65- to 72- Vol .
3 , December 1992 Interactions of NF- « B p65 and I « B/MAD-3 kDa radiolabeled polypeptide from COS cells transfected with the NF- « B p65 expression vector ( lane 3 ) but not from COS cells transfected with an expression vector encoding I « B/MAD-3 ( lane 2 ) or lacking a cDNA insert ( lane 1 ) .
When the IxB/MAD-3 cDNA was coexpressed with NF- « B p65 , a 35- to 40-kDa radiolabeled polypeptide was readily coimmunoprecipitated from recipient cell extracts ( lane 4 ) , indicating the formation of stable NF- « B p65 /IxB complexes in vivo .
However , removal of the C-terminal activation domain sequences , which were required for IxB-mediated inhibition of DNA binding , had no effect on the interaction of I « B/ MAD-3 with NF- « B p65 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Further deletion to residue 312 was also without effect ( lane 7 ) , but deletion to amino acid 296 or beyond , which disrupts the putative nuclear localization signal , yielded NF- « B p65 variants that failed to complex with IxB/MAD-3 ( lanes 8-10 ) .
These coimmunoprecipitation studies thus establish that the C-terminal boundary required for IxB/ MAD-3 binding lies between amino acids 297 and 312 , which is different from the C-terminal boundary for DNA binding ( amino acids 289-291 ) .
These results further demonstrate that the transactivation domain of NF- « B p65 , which is required for IxB-mediated inhibition of DNA binding , is not itself an essential part of the I « B/MAD-3 binding site on NF- « B p65 .
The Most N-terminal Residues of the Rel Homology Domain of NF- « B p65 are Required for DNA Binding but not for Association with IxB/MAD-3 To complement these C-terminal deletion mapping studies , reciprocal experiments were performed with a series of N-terminally truncated NF- « B p65 mutants .
To optimize translation , each of these NF- « B p65 cDNA mutants was prepared using the polymerase chain reaction and matched 5 ' oligonucleotide primers that incorporated a consensus translational initiation sequence ( Kozak , 1987 ) .
Whole-cell extracts prepared from COS cells transfected with these mutant NF- « B p65 constructs were subsequently tested in gel retardation assays ( Figure 4A ) .
In control reactions , a single specific nucleoprotein complex was detected with extracts containing full-length NF- « B p65 ( lane 2 ) but not with extracts from mock-transfected cells ( lane 1 ) .
This DNA binding activity persisted after deletion of up to 20 N-terminal amino acids ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , which affects NF- « B p65 sequences that are divergent from NF- « B p50 ( Ghosh et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Ruben et al. , 1991 ) .
However , removal of 10 or more additional residues , which involves the proximal boundary of the NF- « B p65 Rel homology domain , completely abolished this DNA binding activity ( lanes 5-7 ) .
As shown in Figure 4B , the DNA binding activity of each of the active NF- « B p65 complexes was completely inhibited by coexpression with equivalent amounts of IxB/MAD-3 ( Figure 4B ; lanes 2-4 ) .
These findings indicate that , in 1345 P.A .

- The N-terminal boundaries of both the NF- « B p65 DNA binding domain and IxB/MAD-3 binding domain are distinct .
( A and B ) The most N-terminal sequences of the Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 are required for DNA binding .
COS cells were transfected with the indicated NF- « B p65 expression vectors ( lanes 2-7 ) in the absence ( A ) or presence ( B ) of an I « B/MAD-3 expression vector .
Control transfections were performed with unmodified pCMV4 ( lane 1 ) and full-length NF- « B p65 ( p65 WT ; lane 2 ) .

Extracts from COS cells coexpressing IxB/MAD-3 together with the parental pCMV4 expression vector ( lane 1 ) or the indicated NF- « B p65 variants ( lanes 2-10 ) were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis using an antipeptide antiserum raised against the C-terminus of NF- « B p65 ( amino acids 535-551 ) .

The arrow indicates I « B/MAD-3 .
contrast to the C-terminus of NF- « B p65 , virtually the entire N-terminus of NF- « B p65 is required for DNA binding .
To delineate the N-terminal boundary of the IxB/ MAD-3 binding domain present in NF- « B p65 , a more extensive series of N-terminal truncation mutants was cotransfected into COS cells with equivalent amounts of the IxB/MAD-3 expression vector .
Radiolabeled extracts from these cells were then prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with an antiserum specific for the C-terminus of NF- « B p65 .
As shown in Figure 4C , I « B/MAD-3 was readily immunoprecipitated with this antiserum when coexpressed with the full-length NF- « B p65 protein ( lane 2 ) .
Surprisingly , deletion of up to 150 N-terminal residues did not affect the formation of a stable NF- « B p65 complex ( lanes 3-9 ) .
However , deletion of 50 additional N-terminal amino acids completely abolished its ability to engage IkB/ MAD-3 ( lane 10 ) .
These deletion mapping results thus localize the N-terminal boundary of the NF- « B p65 receptor domain for IxB/MAD-3 to between amino acids 151 and 200 .
Therefore , in contrast to the DNA binding domain ( amino acids 21-291 ) , which spans virtually the entire Rel homology region , the Ix « B/MAD-3 binding domain ( amino acids 151-312 ) encompasses only the distal half of this region .
1346 The NLS of NF- « B p65 is a Primary Target for IxB/ MAD-3 Binding Inspection of the IxB/MAD-3 receptor domain within NF- « B p65 was remarkable for the presence of a basic subregion ( KRKR ; amino acids 301-304 ; see Figure 1A ) within the Rel homology domain that is homologous to the functional NLS present at comparable positions in NF- « B p50 ( RKRQK ; Henkel et al. , 1992 ) and v-Rel ( KRQR ; Gilmore and Temin , 1988 ) .
To explore the potential role of this NF- « B p65 motif in I « B-mediated inhibition , IxB/MAD-3 binding , and nuclear translo-cation , site-directed mutagenesis was used to selectively delete these four codons from the wild-type NF- « B p65 cDNA .
Monkey COS cells were transfected with the resultant cDNA expression vector ( p65 ANLS ) along with increasing doses of the human IxB/MAD-3 expression vector .
Extracts from these COS cell transfectants were normalized for equivalent protein expression and subjected to gel retardation analysis using a P-labeled « B enhancer probe ( Figure 5A ) .
In the absence of IxB/MAD-3 , p65 ANLS ( lane 6 ) appeared to bind DNA with increased affinity relative to the wild-type NF- « B p65 protein ( lane 1 ) .

Whole-cell extracts described in A were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis using an NF- « B p65-specific antipeptide antiserum ( amino acids 535-551 ) .
Radiolabeled immunoprecipitates were fractionated by reducing SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography .

the wild-type protein ( lanes 2-5 ) .
In contrast , similar titrations with I « B/MAD-3 in cells containing p65 ANLS failed to significantly block its DNA binding activity ( lanes 7-10 ) .
As shown in Figure 5B , coimmunoprecipitation studies Eerformed with an NF- « B p65-specific antiserum and **S-labeled extracts derived from these cells showed markedly diminished I « B/MAD-3 binding to the p65 ANLS protein ( lanes 7-10 ) compared with the wild-type NF- « B p65 protein ( lanes 2-5 ) .
Furthermore , as shown in Figure 6A , deletion of four amino acids immediately N-terminal ( p65 A297-300 ; lane 1 ) or eight amino acids C-terminal ( p65 A305-312 ; lane 3 ) to the KRKR motif ( deleted in lane 2 ) did not significantly affect the IxB/MAD-3 binding capacity of these mutant proteins .
Site-directed mutation of the nearby protein kinase A ( PKA ) phosphorylation consensus sequence ( RRPS ; amino acids 273-276 ) within the Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 also had no effect on the interaction of NF- « B p65 with I « B/MAD-3 .
Together , these biochemical data indicate that the KRKR motif present in NF- « B p65 is selectively required for I « xB-mediated inhibition and functions as a primary subregion mediating the stable assembly of NF- « B p65 with I « B/MAD-3 in vivo .
To confirm that this basic subregion within human NF- « B p65 is in fact a functional NLS , immunofluores- Vol .
3 , December 1992 cence studies were performed with NF- « B p65-specific antiserum and COS cell transfectants overexpressing either the Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 ( p65 Rel ; amino acids 1-312 ) or a variant of this terminal deletion mutant lacking the KRKR motif , termed p65 Rel AKRKR .
Of note , preliminary studies performed with the full-length form of NF- « B p65 revealed a predominantly perinuclear or whole-cell pattern of fluorescence ( see Figure 2C ) , suggesting that the presence of the C-terminus intrinsically influences the subcellular disposition of NF- « B p65 .
However , as shown in Figure 6B , immunofluorescence staining of COS cells transfected with a C-terminal deletion mutant truncated downstream of the KRKR motif ( p65 Rel ) clearly demonstrated a nuclear pattern of expression .
Selective deletion of the KRKR motif within this NF- « B p65 mutant profoundly altered the subcellular distribution , yielding a polypeptide ( p65 Rel AKRKR ) confined predominantly to the cytoplasmic compartment .
Similar results were obtained with a mutant substituted within the KRKR domain ( KRKR ~-AAAA ; Ganchi et al. , unpublished results ) .
Furthermore , deletion of a region adjacent to the KRKR motif ( p65 Rel A293-296 ) failed to disrupt the nuclear targeting of this NF- « B p65 construct .
These results confirm the NLS function of this motif in NF- « B p65 .

DISCUSSION The NF- « B complex , a prominent member of the Rel family of transcription factors , is critically involved in both the physiologic activation of T cells in response to `` immunologic stimuli ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986a , b ; Lenardo and Baltimore , 1989 ) and the pathologic induction of HIV-1 gene expression in infected CD4* T lymphocytes ( Muesing et al. , 1987 ; Nabel and Baltimore , 1987 ) .
The prototypic form of this heterodimeric complex is composed of two functionally distinct subunits , NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Ghosh et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Ruben et al. , 1991 ) , which share extensive N-terminal homology with the v-rel oncogene product ( Figure 7 ) ( Gilmore , 1990 ) .
In addition , other interactive Rel-related polypeptides recently have been identified that may also participate in the NF- « B signal transduc-tion pathway through combinatorial associations involving either NF- « B p50 or NF- « B p65 ( Neri et al. , 1991 ; Schmid et al. , 1991 ; Bours et al. , 1992 ; Ruben et al. , 1992a ; Ryseck et al. , 1992 ) .
Although only NF- « B p50 was originally believed to possess DNA binding activity ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Urban and Baeuerle , 1990 ) , recent studies clearly have shown that NF- « B p65 is a « B-specific enhancer-binding protein in its own right ( Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Ruben et al. , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ) .
However , NF- « B p65 differs from NF- « B p50 with respect to several important functions .
Specifically , 1348 NF- « B p65 contains a strong transactivation domain at its C-terminus that is conspicuously absent in NF- « B p50 ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ; Ruben et al. , 1992b ) .
In addition , the in vitro DNA binding activity of NF- « B p65 , but not of NF- « B p50 , is selectively inhibited by IxB , a known cytosolic antagonist of NF- « B function ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ; Urban and Baeuerle , 1990 ; Zabel and Baeuerle , 1990 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ; Ruben et al. , 1991 ; Inoue et al. , 1992b ) .
In this regard , several cDNAs encoding I « B-like inhibitors recently have been cloned , including human MAD-3 ( Haskill et al. , 1991 ) , chicken pp40 ( Davis et al. , 1991 ) , murine I « By ( Inoue et al. , 1992a ) , and human Bcl-3 ( Ohno et al. , 1990 ; Hatada et al. , 1992 ; Wulezyn et al. , 1992 ) .
The high degree of amino acid sequence homology shared among these various inhibitors , such as the presence of multiple ankyrin-like motifs ( Davis et al. , 1991 ; Haskill et al. , 1991 ; Inoue et al. , 1992a ) , suggests a family of related proteins that may differentially regulate one or more members of the NF- « B/ Rel transcription factor pathway .
Furthermore , recent mutational analyses clearly have demonstrated that four of the ankyrin repeats present in pp40 are required to mediate its inhibitory effect on NF- « B p65 DNA binding activity ( Inoue et al. , 1992b ) .
However , the corresponding sequences of NF- « B p65 that interface with these I « B binding determinants and the effect of this interaction on NF- « B p65-dependent transcription in vivo have remained unknown .

- Defined organization of the NF- « B p65 DNA binding domain and functionally bipartite I « B/MAD-3 receptor sequences .
Established amino acid endpoints for the maximal DNA binding ( amino acids 21-291 ) and I « B/MAD-3 binding ( amino acids 151-312 ) domains of NF- « B p65 are shown in relation to previously defined motifs ( see Figure 1A ) .
The region within the NF- « B p65 transactivation domain ( amino acids 450-500 ) shown to be required for IxB-mediated inhibition of NF- « B p65 DNA binding is also bracketed .
explored in detail the molecular basis for the specific interaction between human NF- « B and IxB/MAD-3 , focusing on defining the requisite interaction sequences within NF- « B p65 and the effects of I « B/MAD-3 binding on the various intrinsic biochemical properties of NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 .
IxB /MAD-3 Inhibits NF- « B p65-Dependent Transcription In Vivo Previous functional assays performed with Gal4/NF- « B p65 chimeric proteins identified a potent transactivation domain in the distal 101 amino acids of this 65-kDa subunit ( Figure 7 ) ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ; Ballard et al. , 1992 ) .
Transient expression studies in human Jurkat T cells using the wild-type and C-terminally truncated forms of NF- « B p65 show that these activation sequences also function in the context of the native protein and that IxB/MAD-3 completely negates their stimulatory effects on transcription in vivo .
Of note , I « xB-mediated inhibition was unaffected by the selective deletion of a mini-leucine zipper motif that has been implicated as a part of the transactivation function of NF- « B p65 ( Figure 7 ) ( Ruben et al. , 1992b ) .
These findings strongly suggest that MAD-3 represents at least one functional member of the proposed IxB family of polypeptides that has the capacity to regulate NF- « B p65 -dependent transcription in vivo .
The NLS of NF- « B p65 is the Primary Functional Target of IxB/MAD-3 Phenotypic analysis of a series of N- and C-terminal NF- « B p65 truncation mutants has localized the maximal I « xB/MAD-3 binding domain to a segment of the Rel homology region encompassing amino acids 151 through 312 ( Figure 7 ) .
This region includes a basic tetrapeptide motif ( KRKR ; amino acids 301-304 ; Figure 7 ) ( Ruben et al. , 1991 ) that is highly conserved among all members of the NF- « B/Rel polypeptide family ( Gil- Vol .
3 , December 1992 more , 1990 ) .
In this regard , it has been demonstrated that the corresponding motif within the 110-kDa precursor of NF- « B p50 ( RKRQK ) serves as a functional NLS whose expression is effectively masked in cis by inhibitory C-terminal sequences ( Blank et al. , 1991 ; Henkel ef al. , 1992 ) .
These inhibitory precursor sequences are ultimately removed by proteolytic process-ing , thereby generating the mature 50-kDa DNA binding protein ( Ghosh et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ) .
An alternatively spliced transcript selectively encoding this C-terminal inhibitory domain , termed recently has been cloned and shown to exhibit IxB-like activity in trans ( Inoue et al. , 1992a ) .
We demonstrate here that the basic KRKR motif present in NF- « B p65 is a functional NLS .
Furthermore , specific deletion of this NLS markedly reduces the capacity of IxB/MAD-3 to stably associate with this transactivator protein .
These findings suggest that I « B/MAD-3 directly binds to and masks the NLS of NF- « B p65 , thereby preventing NF- « B p65 from entering the nuclear compartment .
The highly conserved nature of this NLS among the various known Rel proteins underscores a potentially fundamental role for this basic motif in regulating the inducible nuclear import of multiple Rel family members via recognition by IkB .
In this regard , we now show that the subcellular localization of NF- « B p50 is also regulated by IxB/MAD-3 , presumably by a similar mechanism that involves masking of its NLS ( Henkel et al. , 1992 ) .
Recent studies suggest that the homodimeric form of this Rel-related subunit acts specifically as a repressor of NF- « B p65-dependent transcription from the interleukin-2 promoter ( Kang et al. , 1992 ) .
It is not yet clear whether I « By , IxB/MAD-3 , or another member of this growing family of repressors is the authentic physiologic inhibitor of NF- « B p50 function .
Notwithstanding , the ability of the C-terminus of the NF- « B p50 precursor to mask its own NLS , coupled with its homology to both IxBy and I « B/MAD-3 , suggests that the NF- « B p50 NLS plays a 1349 P.A .
Ganchi et al .
role similar to that of the NF- « B p65 NLS in IxB-de-pendent cytoplasmic retention .
The Unique C-terminal Half of NF- « B p65 Attenuates the Rel Domain-Encoded Functions of DNA Binding and Nuclear Localization Transactivation In the present study , we have shown that deletion mutants of NF- « B p65 devoid of the unique C-terminal sequences are more efficiently localized within the nucleus when compared with the wild-type protein .
Previous studies have suggested that these transcriptionally inactive NF- « B p65 mutants also bind DNA with increased affinity ( Nolan et al. , 1991 ) .
The recently recognized capacity of NF- « B p65 to induce I « B/MAD-3 gene expression ( Sun et al. , unpublished results ) may contribute to these functional effects .
Alternatively these effects could be a consequence of the disruption of non-covalent interactions that occur between the C-terminus of NFE- « B p65 and the N-terminal Rel homology domain .
In what may be a related finding , specific deletion of the NLS of NF- « B p65 also enhances its DNA binding activity , suggesting that this stretch of basic residues may serve as a primary contact point for the NF- « B p65 C-terminus .
This proposed type of intramolecular masking mechanism is not without precedent .
For example , as noted above , the NLS within the Rel homology domain of the NF- « B p50 precursor is functionally sequestered by cis-acting C-terminal sequences ( Blank et al. , 1991 ; Henkel et al. , 1992 ) .
In addition , C-terminally truncated variants of the Rel-related dorsal gene product , a maternal morphogen in Drosophila , have been shown to exhibit enhanced nuclear localization properties as compared with the wild-type protein ( Rushlow et al. , 1989 ) .
Similarly , the cell cycle-dependent nuclear import of the yeast transcription factor , SWI5 , is contingent on the regulated disruption of an intramolecular salt bridge involving its NLS ( Moll et al. , 1991 ) .
By analogy , an interplay between the modular N- and C-terminal domains in NF-kB p65 may represent an alternative mechanism for regulating the potent transcriptional activity of NF- « B p65 in an IxB-independent manner .
This inhibitory interaction could conceivably be relieved by dimerization with other Rel polypeptides ( e.g. , NF- « B p50 ) or by specific posttranslational modification ( e.g. , phosphoryla-tion ) that induces an `` open ' '' NF- « B p65 structural con-figuration .
The NF- « B p65 Transactivation Domain and NLS are Essential for a Fully Functional NF- « B p65 /IxB Interaction Although the N-terminal Rel homology domain of NF- « B p65 is fully capable of binding I « B/MAD-3 , I « B-mediated inhibition of NF- « B p65 DNA binding activity requires additional sequences that map to the remote 1350 C-terminal transactivation domain .
This relationship explains the paradoxical finding that IxB/MAD-3 efficiently engages both NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 but inhibits the DNA binding activity of only NF- « B p65 ( see Figure 2 , A and B ) .
Specifically , these selective inhibitory effects of IxB/MAD-3 on NF- « B p65 do not derive from subtle differences between the Rel homology domains of NF- « B p65 and NF- « B p50 ( Nolan et al. , 1991 ) but rather involve the unique C-terminal transactivation domain of NF- « B p65 , which is missing in NF- « B p50 .
Coupled with the finding that the subcellular localization of NF- « B p50 can be regulated by IxB/MAD-3 , the Rel homology domain itself can be considered an IxB-resistant DNA binding unit containing an IxB-sensitive NLS .
In this model , the ability of I « B/MAD-3 to block DNA binding activity depends critically on C-terminal sequences downstream of the Rel homology domain , which are highly divergent among the various NF- « B/ Rel polypeptides ( Gilmore , 1990 ) .
Given the ability of I « B/MAD-3 to control the inducible expression of NF- « B at the level of subcellular localization , this alternate inhibitory potential would seem redundant .
However , should I « B/MAD-3 gain access to the nucleus , its capacity to inhibit DNA binding may serve a pivotal role in promoting disengagement of NF- « B p65 bound to its cognate enhancer ( Zabel and Baeuerle , 1990 ) .
In this regard , an inhibitor of NF- « B DNA binding activity has been identified in nuclear extracts from T lymphocytes and further shown to be highly sensitive to treatment with deoxycholate ( Kang et al. , 1992 ) , a characteristic biochemical property of IxB ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1988a , b ) .
As such , through its dual capacity to block nuclear import as well as DNA binding , IB could control both the rapid mobilization of NF- « B from the cytoplasm and the subsequent termination of NF- « B p65-dependent transcription in the nucleus .
