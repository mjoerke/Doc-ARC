GENE THERAPY Monocyte Arrest and Transmigration on Inflamed Endothelium in Shear Flow Is Inhibited by Adenovirus-Mediated Gene Transfer of IxB-a « By Kim S.C. Weber , Georg Draude , Wolfgang Erl , Rainer de Martin , and Christian Weber Mobilization of nuclear factor- « B ( NF- « B ) activates transcription of genes encoding endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines that contribute to monocyte infiltration critical in atherogenesis .
Inhibition of NF- « B has been achieved by pharmacological and genetic approaches ; however , monocyte interactions with activated endothelium in shear flow follow ing gene transfer of the NF- « B inhibitor IkB- « have not been studied .
We found that overexpression of IkB- « in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF- « ) -induced degradation of IkB- « and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and E-selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) and grow th-related activity- « ( GRO- « ) by TNF- « .
This was associated with a reduction in endothelial MCP-1 secretion and ONOCYTE ADHESION and emigration involves sequential and overlapping interactions of signal molecules and is fundamental in the initial pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis. ! ''
Whereas monocyte rolling on endothelium is mediated by selectins , activation of B1 and B2 integrins that bind to their endothelial ligands , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , respectively , is critical for firm adhesion and transmi-gration . ''
The expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 has been demonstrated in coronary atherosclerotic lesions , particularly in areas of neovascularization , and may contribute to leukocyte recruitment .
* '' Moreover , the CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) , which can trigger chemotaxis and extravasation of monocytes via its receptor CCR2 , has been detected in atherosclerotic plaques . ''
In addition , the induction and immobilization of the CXC chemokine growth-related activity- ( GRO-a ) can induce monocyte adhesion to endothelium stimulated by minimally modified low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , implying a role in monocyte recruitment during athero-genesis . ' ''
Inflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor- ( TNF- « @ ) , upregulate the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , and E-selectin and the production of chemokines , eg , MCP-1 , at the level of gene transcription involving the binding of nuclear factor-kB ( NF-KB ) to motifs in the promoter regions .
''~'* Activation and nuclear translocation of NFE- « B occurs in endothelial cells and requires the phosphor-ylation of its inhibitor IxB- « , which is degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway .
' 5 ! 8 Inhibition of NF-kB by increasing levels of in endothelial cells has been suggested to be of potential use in suppressing the inflammatory response . '' ''
Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer may be a potentially specific and effective method of gene delivery into local areas of inflamma-tion , such as atherosclerotic plaques or after balloon angio-plasty . ''
We used an adenoviral vector encoding IKxB- « to inhibit NF-KB activation and found that gene transfer of IKB- « in endothelial cells impaired the TNF-a « -induced upregulation Blood , Vol 93 , No 11 ( June 1 ) , 1999 ; pp 3685-3693 GRO- « immobilization .
Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest , spreading , and transmigration of monocytes on TNF- « -activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by IkB- « overexpression .
Inhibition with monoclonal antibodies and peptide antagonists inferred that this was due to reduced expression of Ig integrin ligand as well as of chemokines specifically involved in these events .
In contrast , rolling of monocytes was increased by IxB- « transfer and was partly mediated by P-selectin ; however , it appeared to be unaffected by the inhibition of E-selectin induction .
Thus , our data provide novel evidence that selective modulation of NF-kB by adenoviral transfer of IkB- « impairs the expression of multiple endothelial gene products required for subsequent monocyte arrest and emigration in shear flow and thus for monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques .

Overexpression of adenovirally encoded IxB-a in endothelial cells .
Construction of the adenoviral vector encoding for IxB- « ( rAd.IkB-a ) and infection of endothelial cells were performed as previously described . ''
Briefly , confluent HUVEC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and incubated with the adenovirus ( multiplicity of infection [ moi ] of 100 ) in PBS for 30 minutes at 37°C , washed , and then cultured for 48 hours .
Infection with a control adenoviral vector '' encoding green fluorescence protein ( rAd.GFP ) was performed at an equivalent moi of 100 , and effective transduction was confirmed by analyzing GFP expression by flow cytometry , as described . ''
Unless otherwise stated , cells were stimulated with TNF-a ( 100 U/mL ) for 4 hours .
Overexpression of IkB-a may induce apoptosis in TNF-o-activated endothelial cells by suppressing induction of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins '' ; however , cell viability was determined to be greater than 95 % under all conditions .
For Western blot , cells left untreated or activated with TNF- « for 1 hour were lysed in sample buffer containing protease inhibitors and lysates were separated by 12.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) .

Flow cytometry and quantification of MCP-1 protein .
- Confluent HUVEC were trypsinized , washed , and reacted with saturating concentrations of MoAb for 30 minutes on ice , washed , and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -or phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated goat antimouse IgG ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) , washed , and analyzed in a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson , Heidelberg , Germany ) . ''
The concentration of MCP-1 protein present in the HUVEC supernatants was determined using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ; R & D Systems ) performed according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
Monocyte adhesion and transmigration on endothelium in shear flow .
Laminar flow assays were performed as previously described .
`` `` '' * '' HUVEC were grown to confluence in 35-mm petri dishes that were assembled as the lower wall in a parallel wall flow chamber and mounted on the stage of an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope ( Olympus Optical , Hamburg , Germany ) with 20X and 40X phase contrast objectives .
Monocytes ( 0.5 X or Mono Mac 6 cells WEBER ET AL ( 105/mL ) suspended in Hanks ' buffered salt solution containing 10 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.4 , 0.5 % human serum albumin , and 1 mmol/L 1 mmol/L Ca** added shortly before the assay ) were kept in a heating block at 37°C during assays and were perfused into the flow chamber at a rate of 1.5 dyn/cm '' for 5 minutes .
The number of firmly adherent cells after 5 minutes was quantitated in multiple fields ( at least 5 per experiment ) by analysis of images recorded with a long integration JVC 3CCD video camera and a JVC SR L 900 E video recorder ( JVC , Japan ) , and expressed as cells per square millimeter .
The type of adhesion analyzed was restricted to primary , ie , direct interactions of monocytes with endothelium .
Consistent with findings using a similar flow chamber , '' secondary attachment to already adherent monocytes that is mediated by L-selectin and results in the formation of linear strings '' occurred only sporadically at 1.5 dyn/cm '' , accounting for a very small component of total interactions .
The extent of secondary tethers may vary due to differences in the dimension , profile , and other design characteristics of the flow chambers used .
The number of cells remaining bound , undergoing shape change , or transmigrating after 5-minute intervals was determined in high power fields , as described , '' and expressed as the percentage of cells that had firmly adhered .
As an inverse measure of firm arrest , the number of cells rolling at reduced velocity on endothelium was determined within the last 30 seconds of the 5-minute intervals and was expressed as the percentage of all cells interacting with HUVEC in the field .
Pretreatment with MoAbs was performed at 10 ug/mL .
Data are expressed as the mean + SD .

After 48 hours in culture , cells were challenged with TNF-a ( 100 U/mL ) for 1 hour and the expression of IxB- « was determined by Western blot .
In unstimulated cells , IxB- « was observed as a band of 37 kD ( Fig 1 , lane 1 ) .
Treatment of cells with TNF- « resulted in a marked decrease in detectable IxB- « compared with untreated cells , consistent with the degradation of IxB-a « ( Fig 1 , lane 2 ) .

INHIBITION OF MONOCYTE ARREST IN FLOW BY IkB expression ( Fig 1 , lane 3 ) .
Stimulation with TNF- « after rAd.IxB-a « infection decreased the expression of IxB- « , which , however , remained higher than in uninfected cells ( Fig 1 , lane 4 ) .
This was confirmed by densitometrical analysis ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that overexpression of IxB- « prevents a substantial IxB-o degradation and NF-kB mobilization induced by TNF-a .
IxB-a inhibits mRNA transcription of endothelial signal molecules .

Cells were left untreated , infected with rAd.IB- « , and/ or stimulated with TNF-a ( 100 U/mL ) for 4 hours .
RT-PCR was performed using specific primers for ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , and E-selectin ( A ) ; for MCP-1 and GRO- « ( B ) ; and for B-actin .
Quantification was perfomed by HPLC analysis , and mRNA expression was reported as the percentage of B-actin serving as an internal standard .
Data are the mean + SD of three separate experiments .
3687 Inhibition of TNF-o-induced adhesion molecule expression by IxB-a .
We determined whether rAd.IkB- « infection impaired the surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules by flow cytometric analysis .
Untreated HUVEC expressed moderate levels of ICAM-1 and low levels of VCAM-1 and E-selectin ( Fig 3A ) .
Stimulation with TNF-a ( 100 U/mL for 4 hours ) markedly increased the expression of ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , and E-selectin ( Fig 3B through D ) .
Infection with rAd.IrB- « almost completely inhibited the upregulation of adhesion molecules induced by TNF- « ( Fig 3B through D ) .
Thus , overexpression of IxB- « prevented the upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecule surface expression .
To control for effects of adenoviral infection itself , we infected HUVEC with the control vector rAd.GFP '' '' encoding GEP at an equivalent moi of 100 under identical conditions .
Flow cytometric analysis showed a marked GFP expression in greater than 90 % of HUVEC after 48 hours , confirming a high transduction efficiency ( Fig 4A ) .
Notably , infection of HUVEC with rAd.GFP under these conditions did not affect the surface expression of ICAM-1 in unstimulated HUVEC ( Fig 4B ) or in HUVEC stimulated with TNF-a ( 100 U/mL ) for 4 hours ( Fig 4C ) .
Effect of IxB-a @ on endothelial secretion of chemokines .
It has been shown that MCP-1 is secreted by endothelium as a soluble protein , whereas GRO- « can be immobilized on the endothelial surface. ! ''
An ELISA of HUVEC supernatants showed that stimulation with TNF- « for 4 hours induced an increase in secretion of MCP-1 protein that was completely prevented by overexpression of IxB-a « in HUVEC ( Fig 5A ) .
To determine the effects of rAd.IKB- « on immobilized GRO- « , we measured the amount of surface-associated protein by flow cytometric analysis .
We found that TNF- « stimulation increased the amount of GRO- « associated with the endothelial surface that was inhibited by overexpression of IxB-a « ( Fig 5B ) .
Effect of IxB-a on monocyte interactions with endothelium in shear flow .
- Firm adhesion of monocytes to endothelium under shear flow involves the « 4 and B2 integrins , known to interact with VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 , respectively. > '' Moreover , chemokines such as IP10 , Mig , and eotaxin have been implicated in the arrest of T effector cells and eosinophils in shear flow , respectively . '' '' '' ''
Recently , we have shown that surface-bound GRO- « is involved in monocyte arrest , whereas soluble MCP-1 mediates transmigration of monocytes on activated endothelium in shear flow . '' ''
Hence , we studied the effects of IxB- @ overexpression on monocyte adhesion to activated endothelium under physiological flow conditions .
After 48 hours in culture , HUVEC infected with rAd.IxB-a « or left untreated were stimulated with TNF- « ( 100 U/mL ) for 4 hours and inserted as the bottom wall of a parallel flow chamber .
Isolated human blood monocytes or monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells , which express a similar array of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors , '' '' were perfused through the chamber at a constant shear rate of 1.5 dyn/cm '' .
After a 5-minute period of accumulation , the number of Mono Mac 6 cells firmly attached to uninfected HUVEC treated with TNF- « was determined to be 198 + 46 cells/mm '' ( Fig 6A ) .
By comparison , overexpression of IxB-a « in HUVEC before TNF- « stimulation resulted in a significant inhibition in the number of cells firmly arrested after 5 minutes ( 59 + 22 cells/mm ) , whereas infection with the control vector From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

GFP had no effect and thus did not confound cell arrest ( Fig 6A ) .
Because leukocytes can bind to adherent leukocytes via L-selectin , * ' 4 '' only direct interactions of monocytes with endothelium were included in this analysis .
As described , '' a percentage of firmly attached cells was observed to undergo shape change or spreading and migrate towards interendothelial junctions and transmigrate .
On uninfected HUVEC treated with TNF-a , 25.0 % + 5.7 % of the firmly attached cells were found to undergo a shape change , spreading , or transmigration ( Fig 6B ) .
Infection of HUVEC with but not with control GFP adenovirus resulted in a clear reduction in the fraction of cells spreading or transmigrating ( Fig 6B ) .
Analysis of experiments performed with isolated human blood monocytes showed that 110 + 26 cells/mm '' had firmly attached after a 5-minute period on uninfected and TNF-o-treated HUVEC at a shear rate of 1.5 dyn/cm '' ( Fig 7A ) .
Of these firmly attached cells , 27.5 % + 4.9 % appeared to spread or to transmigrate between endothelial cells ( Fig 7B ) .
Consistent with previous results , '' a combination of « 4 and B2 MoAbs markedly reduced firm arrest , as well as spreading and transmigration of monocytes ( Fig 7A and B ) .
Similarly , infection of HUVEC with rAd.IKB- « significantly inhibited the shear-resistant adhesion of monocytes to TNF- « -activated endothelium as compared with uninfected controls ( Fig 7A ) .
Subse-quently , the percentage of attached cells that underwent spreading or transmigration was lower on HUVEC overexpressing IxB- « ( Fig 7B ) .

specific peptide antagonists showed that GRO-a « is involved in monocyte arrest ( Fig 7A ) , whereas MCP-1 contributes to monocyte transmigration on activated endothelium in shear flow ( Fig 7B ) .
Control peptides had no effect ( data not shown ) .
Preincubation of monocytes with a combination of blocking o4 and B2 MoAb in addition to infection of HUVEC with rAd.IkB- « resulted in a slightly although not significantly greater inhibition of monocyte arrest and of spreading/ transmigration as compared with infection with rAd.IrB-a « or MoAb treatment alone ( Fig 7A and B ) .
Taken together , these data infer that , beyond effects on endothelial Ig integrin ligands , the reduced chemokine expression in rAd.IkB-w-infected HUVEC is at least in part responsible for the inhibition of arrest and transmigration .
We next investigated the effect of IxB- « overexpression on selectin-mediated rolling interactions of monocytes on endothelium .
Previous reports have demonstrated that rolling of monocytes on activated endothelium is largely mediated by interactions of L-selectin and P-selectin . ''
On TNF-o-treated HUVEC , the rolling fraction of cells was found to be 21.2 % + 6.1 % of cells in the field ( Fig 7C ) .
Because initial rolling is rapidly converted into integrin-mediated firm adhesion , cells were pretreated with MoAbs to « 4 and B2 integrins to inhibit arrest and facilitate analysis of rolling .
This resulted in an increase in the rolling fraction of cells , thus serving as an inverse measure of firm arrest .

INHIBITION OF MONOCYTE ARREST IN FLOW BY IB cells ( 34.5 % + 5.8 % of cells in the field ) .
Preincubation of rAd.IkB-o-infected HUVEC with a blocking MoAb to P-selectin caused a clear reduction in the rolling fraction of cells ( Fig 7C ) and consequently an inhibition in firm arrest ( 47 + 14 cells/mm ) .
In contrast , the nonblocking P-selectin MoAb had no effect on rolling or firm arrest .
Thus , these results show that P-selectin is involved in monocyte rolling , a prerequisite for firm adhesion .

This was associated with a decrease in the adhesion and transmigration but not rolling of monocytes on activated endothelium in physiological flow and expands on previous findings that adenoviral gene transfer of IxB- « effectively inhibits NF- « B-dependent pro-cesses '' '' in a functionally relevant system .
Whereas stimulation of uninfected HUVEC markedly reduced the levels of IxB-a protein , most likely due to its proteolytic degrada-tion , `` '' '' stimulation of cells with TNF- « decreased the levels of IxB-a « that , however , remained higher than in control cells .
IxB- « expressed by adenoviral gene transfer may be phosphorylated and thus more susceptible to TNF-a « -induced degradation ; however , as observed with LPS stimulation , the overwhelming proportion of IkB- « could not be processed . '' ''
In comparison with the adenoviral techniques used here , retrovirus-mediated transfer of wild-type or a truncated form of IkB-a did not result in a marked overexpression in HUVEC . ''
This may be due in part to the presence of the nuclear localizing sequence in the adenoviral vector , but also reflects the high efficacy of infection by the adenovirus .
To our best knowledge , this is the first study demonstrating the effects of IxB- « overexpression on leukocyte adhesion and transmigration in shear flow .
As such , it clearly extends previous reports describing pharmacological and genetic approaches that inhibit NF- « B mobilization or increase the levels of IxB- « .
' '' 2252 As previously found , ' > '' '' * '' '' we show that inhibition of NF-kB mobilization by overexpression of IKB- « inhibited the induction of endothelial adhesion molecule mRNA and protein expression by TNF- « , in particular that of the integrin ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 .
This was not due to apoptosis , because cell viability was unaltered after stimulation with TNF-a for 4 hours , whereas the onset of apoptosis occurs only after 6 hours . '' ''
The effects were associated with a significant reduction in the ability of monocytic cells to firmly arrest and an increase in the rolling fraction of cells on rAd.IKB- « -infected HUVEC under physiological flow conditions .
It has been shown that a combination of blocking a4 and B2 integrins inhibits the adhesion of monocytes '' and as an inverse measure of firm arrest , resulted in a shift to more rolling interactions on activated HUVEC in shear flow .

* P < .05 versus uninfected control .
effects of IxB- « overexpression are likely due to reduced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 , ligands for the o4 integrin VLA-4 and the B2 integrin LFA-1 , respectively .
In addition , subsequent spreading and transmigration of monocytes was reduced on rAd.IxB- « -infected HUVEC .
Because transendothelial migration of leukocytes requires the coordinated regulation of integrin avidity , particularly that of VLA-4 and LFA-1 , '' > impaired expression of their ligands may also contribute to decreased transmigration across rAd.IkB-u-infected HUVEC .
Inhibition of NF- « B also suppressed the production of the chemokines MCP-1 and GRO-a in TNF-o-stimulated HUVEC , which are critically involved in monocyte adhesion and chemo-taxis .
'*** '' 5 Interestingly , overexpression of IxB- « appeared to be slightly more effective in inhibiting firm monocyte arrest on endothelium .

HUVEC were left untreated or were infected with rAd.I « B- « and were stimulated with TNF- « ( 100 U/mL ) for 4 hours .
Monocytes were perfused at a constant flow rate of 1.5 dyn/cm ?
after pretreatment with or without MoAbs to 4 and B2 , 8-73 GRO- « , or 9-76 MCP-1 peptide analogues ( 1 g/ mL each ) for 30 minutes on ice before being perfused .
( A ) The firm attachment of monocytes to HUVEC was determined by counting the number of cells attached per field after a 5-minute period .
( B ) Cells undergoing spreading or transmigration were counted after 5 minutes and expressed as the percentage of cells initially attached .
( C ) The number of rolling cells within the field was counted in the last 30 seconds of the 5-minute period and was expressed as the percentage of cells interacting with endothelium .
HUVEC were pretreated with a blocking ( G1 ) or nonblocking P-selectin ( $ 12 ) MoAb for 30 minutes at 37°C .
Data are the mean + SD of at least three independent experiments .

INHIBITION OF MONOCYTE ARREST IN FLOW BY IkB combination with an 4 MoAb inhibited eosinophil arrest on activated endothelium.4 '' * '' GRO- « can be immobilized to mmLDL-treated HUVEC and facilitate monocyte adhesion to endothelium , '' whereas monocyte transmigration appears to require a soluble gradient of MCP-1 .
* '' Indeed , we have recently established a hierarchical involvement of chemokines in monocyte traffic on activated endothelium in shear flow , ie , monocyte arrest requires surface-bound GRO- « , whereas subsequent transmigration is mediated by MCP-1 presented in a soluble gradient created by removal of secreted protein in shear flow . '' ''
We have confirmed here the contributions of these chemokines using peptide antagonists .
Moreover , the combination of MoAb to integrins with peptide antagonists or with infection of HUVEC appeared to slightly accentuate the inhibition of monocyte arrest , as well as spreading and transmigration .
Thus , the reduction in GRO- « due to NF-KB inhibition may contribute to decreased monocyte adhesion in shear flow .
In addition , overexpression of IkB-a in HUVEC may result in a marked reduction in MCP-1 secretion that would impair the establishment of an MCP-1 gradient and thus monocyte transmigration .
Hence , our data for the first time provide evidence that , in addition to effects on endothelial Ig integrin ligands , the reduced expression of specifically required chemokines in rAd.IxB-o-infected HUVEC contributes to the inhibition of monocyte arrest and transmigration in shear flow .
Interestingly , overexpression of IxB- « decreased firm adhesion but increased the rolling fraction of cells , indicating a shift to more rolling interactions .
Blocking MoAb inhibition assays have shown that monocyte rolling on activated endothelium is largely mediated by P- and L-selectin , whereas no role for E-selectin was seen , '' '' suggesting that interactions of P- or L-selectin are sufficient .
Although effects of NF-kB mobilization on E-selectin expression are well described , '' the regulation of P-selectin expression by the auto-regulatory loop is not yet clear .
Evidence with respect to the upregulation of P-selectin expression by TNF-a is not entirely conclusive. > '' * '' '' Moreover , proteasome inhibitors and antioxidants have been shown to decrease the expression of endothelial P-selectin independently of NF-kB inhibition . ''
We found that rolling interactions of monocytes were not affected by NF-kB inhibition in endothelial cells and that P-selectin , which was not inhibited by overexpression of IxB- « , plays a partial role in mediating monocyte rolling .
These results are consistent with previous reports showing that rolling is not affected by E-selectin. > '' Inhibition of NF-kB activation in endothelial cells has been suggested to be useful in dampening inflammatory re-sponses. ! ''
Notably , the inhibition of endothelial VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expression that can be specifically detected in atherosclerotic lesions* '' '' appeared to be more prominent than that of ICAM-1 , indicating a selective rather than general immunomodulatory effect .
This was consistent with findings with PDTC or aspirin ' '' '' '' and may be due to differential contributions of a variant NF-KB site or dimer compositions to ICAM-1 transcription . ''
Adenoviral gene transfer of IkB-a may offer advantages in its localized applicability , '' but deleterious effects of inhibiting NF-kB translocation in large cell populations can not be excluded .
Previous reports have confirmed the efficacy of adenoviral gene transfer in normal , 3691 atherosclerotic , or balloon-injured blood vessels .
`` > '' '' Although infection with control adenovirus alone did not increase ICAM-1 expression or cell arrest in our assays , adenovirus-mediated gene transfer itself may result in an inflammatory response and antigenicity , '' which warrants further studies addressing the feasibility of adenoviral gene transfer in vivo .
In conclusion , overexpression of IxB- « in endothelium may reduce extravasation of monocytes and other leukocyte subsets and be of potential use in limiting the inflammatory response in areas of atherosclerosis or after balloon injury .
