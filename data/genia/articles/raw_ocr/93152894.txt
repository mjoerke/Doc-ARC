Interleukin-3 Expression by Activated T Cells Involves an Inducible , T-Cell-Specific Factor and an Octamer Binding Protein By Kimberly Davies , Elizabeth C. TePas , David G. Nathan , and Bernard Mathey-Prevot Interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) is exclusively expressed by activated T and natural killer cells , a function that is tightly controlled both in a lineage-specific and in a stimulation-dependent manner .
We have investigated the protein binding characteristics and functional importance of the ACT-1-acti-vating region of the IL-3 promoter .
This region binds an inducible , T-cell-specific factor over its 5 end , a site that is necessary for the expression of IL-3 in the absence of other upstream elements .
Over its 3 ' end , it binds a factor that is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed .
This factor NTERLEUKIN-3 ( IL-3 ) is a hematopoietic growth factor that supports the differentiation and proliferation of early precursors of the myeloid , erythroid , monocytic , and mega-karyocytic cell lines . ''
Its expression is tightly regulated in both a lineage-specific and a stimulation-dependent manner and is restricted to activated T and natural killer ( NK ) cells . ''
Regulation of IL-3 expression takes place at several levels , but it has been shown that the accelerated production of IL-3 by activated T cells is partly due to an increase in the rate of transcription of the gene at the level of the promoter .
Therefore , we have endeavored to uncover the mechanisms of transcriptional control of the human IL-3 gene so that we may broaden our understanding of the means by which IL-3 production is enhanced when a rapid hematopoietic response is required .
IL-2 is functionally distinct , but , like IL-3 , its expression is limited to activated T cells . ''
The parallel in expression profiles suggests that the promoters for IL-2 and IL-3 might share common regulatory elements , despite the failure to detect such elements based on sequence homology .
Earlier studies have identified three cis-acting regulatory elements in the IL-3 promoter , all within 300 bp upstream of the transcription start site .
An AP-1 site at position -301 is necessary for maximal transcriptional activation .
Immediately downstream of the AP-1 site is a strong repressor element , termed NIP , that completely inhibits gene transcription in the absence of the AP-1 site .
A third regulatory element , at position -157 , referred to as ACT-1° or NF-IL3-A , '' is thought to mediate T-cell-specific expression and to be a site of nuclear factor binding.© '' We demonstrate here that this element actually encompasses two distinct protein-binding sites .

0006-497 928 is Oct-1 or an immunologically related octamer-binding protein , and it plays a role in coordinating the activity of several regulatory elements .
These characteristics make the ACT-1 site analogous to the activating ARRE-1 site in the IL-2 promoter .
Furthermore , and despite a lack of sequence homology , the promoters of IL-3 and IL-2 share an organizational pattern of regulatory elements that is likely to be important for the T-cell-specific expression of these genes .

end , ACT-1 binds an inducible , T-cell-specific factor that shares functional properties and DNA-binding affinity with the Octamer-l-associated protein ( OAP ) of the ARRE-1 element of the IL-2 promoter .
Over its 3 end , ACT -1 binds a constitutive factor that we show to be an octamer-binding protein .
Functionally , the inducible binding factor is capable of conferring inducible expression on an IL-3 reporter gene .
Although the constitutive ( octamer-binding ) factor can itself lead to some expression of a reporter gene , its role is more likely to coordinate the functions of the several cis-acting regulatory elements of the promoter , leading to maximal IL-3 production upon induction .
Thus , both the binding and functional characteristics of ACT-1 overlap those of the ARRE-1 site of the IL-2 promoter .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and stimulation .
- MLA144 , Jurkat , Raji , K562 , U937 , and human fibroblast cell lines were grown at 37°C , 5 % CO ; in RPMI 1640 , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 50 U/mL penicillin , 50 ug/mL streptomycin , and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine .
Activation of MLA144 cells was accomplished by treatment with 10 ng/mL of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) .
Other cell lines were activated with both PMA ( 10 ng/mL ) and ionomycin ( 0.5 amol/L ) .
MLA 144 and Jurkat cells express IL-3 upon activation . ''
DNA-binding assays .
- Nuclear salt-wash extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al . ''
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in 15 LL reactions containing ~5.7 ug of crude nuclear extract , 1 to 3 ug of poly dI-dC , and buffer ( 10 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.8/5 mmol/L potassium glutamate/5 mmol/L MgCl ; / ! 1 mmol/L EDTA/1 mmol/L dithiothreitol/5 % [ vol/vol ] glycerol ) .
The binding activity of the inducible factor was noted to be sensitive to changes in the poly dI-dC stock .
For competition experiments , excess unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors ( 40 to 80 ng ) were preincubated with the nuclear extract at 0°C for 8 minutes before addition of P-labeled probe .
The reaction was then further incubated at 0°C for 30 minutes before the DNA-protein complexes were separated on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel ( 4 % to 6.5 % ) at 180 V for 2.5 hours .
Gels were dried before autoradiography .
Oligonucleotide competitors were synthetically generated .
Supershift assay and methylation interference .
- The mobility shift reaction was incubated at 0°C with the probe for 30 minutes before the addition of 0.15 LL of antiserum .
The reaction was then incubated at 0°C for another 30 minutes .
Alternatively , 0.15 L of antiserum was incubated at 0°C for 30 minutes before addition of the probe .
Antiserum was provided by Gerald R. Crabtree ( Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) .
It has been shown to bind Oct-1 , but has not been tested for cross-reactivity with Oct-2 .
Methylation interference experiments were performed as described by Martin et al . ' ''

ROLE OF THE ACT-1 SITE IN IL-3 EXPRESSION IL-3 reporter genes .
- The reporter gene constructs consist of human genomic IL-3 sequences that include various lengths of upstream promoter sequences and that extend to the EcoRI site downstream of the last exon .
The first exon contains a 12-mer X/o I linker insertion at a unique Hpa I site , as previously The Stu I site at -315 and the Sca I site at -173 were used to generate the -315 and -173 constructs , respectively .
Internal mutations within the -315 promoter were made by polymerase chain reactions ( PCRs ) .
To generate the construct with a mutated constitutive binding site , the sequences from -315 to -147 ( primers A and B ) and from -138 to the CAP site ( primers C and D ) were each amplified using the following primers .
Primer A includes the # find3-containing polylinker sequence upstream of -315 ( CATGATTACGCCAAGCTTGGG ) .
Primer B inserts a BamHI site downstream of -147 ( GGGGG-ATCCTTATTCATCCATGACTT ) .
Primer C inserts a BamHI site upstream of -138 ( GGGGGATCCGTGGTTTTCTATGGAGG ) .
Primer D includes the CAP site ( AAAGGATCCTGAAGAGT-TGGCAAC ) .
The two PCR fragments were ligated at their BamHI sites .
The ligated fragment was digested with Hind3 and Sma I ( site at position -61 ) and was then subcloned into the reporter gene construct between the # 7ind3 site in the pUC 13 polylinker and the Sma I site at -61 .
To generate the construct with the entire ACT-1 site mutated , the sequences from -315 to -155 ( primers A and E ) and from -138 to the CAP site ( primers C and D ) were each amplified .
Primer E inserts a BamHI site downstream of -155 ( GGGGGATCCCCATGACTTTCTAGTAC ) .
These PCR fragments were ligated and subcloned as above .
The corresponding -173 constructs were made by Sca I digestion of the mutated -31 5 constructs .
Sequence analysis of these constructs confirmed the accuracy of the mutations .
Electroporation and RNA isolation .
- Reporter genes were introduced into MLA144 cells by electroporation .
Cells ( 3 X 10 '' ) were pelleted and resuspended in 2.4 mL of serum-free RPMI .
Fifty micrograms of reporter gene DNA in a pUC 13 vector was added to the cells .
After incubation on ice for 5 minutes , the DNA was elec-troporated into the cells in 0.8-mL aliquots at 275 V and 980 LF .
Cells were resuspended in 55 mL of RPMI complete and incubated at 37°C .
At 36 hours , cells were stimulated with PMA and 9 hours later , they were lysed with guanidium isothiocyanate ( GITC ) and RNA was isolated , as described by Niemeyer et al .
RNase protection assay .
- Twenty-five micrograms of total cellular RNA was resuspended in 31 LL of hyb-buffer ( 80 % [ vol/vol ] forma-mide/40 mmol/L PIPES , pH 6.4/400 mmol/L NaCl/1 mmol/L EDTA ) containing the appropriate `` P-labeled RNA probe .
RNase protection was as previously described.© Hybridization was performed at 52°C overnight .
Digestion with RNase A and TI was performed at 37°C for 30 minutes .
Reactions were treated with proteinase K at 37°C for 30 minutes , extracted with phenol/chloroform , and loaded on a 6 % Tris borate EDTA ( TBE ) acrylamide/urea gel .
For the probe , a Sma I-Pst I fragment containing exon 1 of the IL-3 gene was modified by insertion of a Xho I linker ( 12-mer ) at a unique Z7pa I site and subcloned into SPT 18 ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
The antisense probe ( 330 nt ) is obtained with SP6 polymerase after linearization with EcoRI , as previously described by Mathey-Prevot et al .
On RNase protection assay , the reporter gene yields a 226-bp protected fragment , whereas the endogenous gibbon IL-3 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) yields two protected fragments of 151 and 63 nt .

absent with the unstimulated extract but appears after cell stimulation .
Both bindings are specific , as excess unlabeled probe competes with labeled probe for binding ( lane c ) .
Other bands observed in Fig 1A represent nonspecific binding to the probe .
To localize the two binding sites within the ACT 1 element , two overlapping oligonucleotides that span either the 3 ' ( nt -151 through -142 ) or the 5 ( nt -159 through -147 ) end of ACT -1 were used as competitors of the binding to the ACT-1 probe ( Fig 1C ) .
The constitutive band is selectively competed by the 3 ' oligonucleotide ( lane a ) , whereas the 5° oligonucleotide specifically competes the inducible binding ( lane b ) .
The close proximity of these binding sites raises the question of whether these two factors can bind independently of one another .
To address this issue , two probes corresponding to the 5 ' and 3 ' oligonucleotides used in the above competition experiment were compared with the ACT-1 probe for their ability to bind nuclear proteins from unstimulated and stimulated MLA 144 cells ( Fig 1D ) .
An inducible factor , absent in unstimulated extract ( lane a ) , is seen to bind to the 5 ' probe ( lane b ) and is specifically competed by excess unlabeled probe ( lane c ) .
The migration of this complex is identical to the lower , inducible complex observed with the ACT-1 probe ( lane d ) that is specifically competed by excess ACT-1 probe ( lane e ) .
However , the 3 ' probe interacts with a constitutive factor whose binding is unaffected by T-cell activation ( lanes f and g ) .
This complex is specific as it is efficiently competed with excess unlabeled 3 ' probe ( lane h ) and comigrates with the constitutive complex observed with ACT-1 ( lane d ) .
Due to the choice of a lower percentage gel , the difference in migration between the constitutive and inducible complexes in Fig 1D is better resolved .
Because the migration for the constitutive and inducible complexes does not change when 3 ' or 5 ' probes , respectively , are compared with the ACT-1 probe , it appears that , under our conditions , these two factors bind independently of each other and may be mutually ex-clusive .
However , we can not exclude the possibility that , in vivo , the two factors bind simultaneously to the ACT-1 site .
Methylation interference analysis performed on the top band , using an ACT -1 probe labeled on the noncoding strand , shows that the constitutive binding occurs over nt -149 through -145 .
Similar analysis of the inducible complex , using the 5 ' probe labeled on the coding strand , shows binding over nt -155 through -150 ( Fig 1B ) .
These data indicate that , in vitro , the two nuclear factors contact adjacent regions over a short stretch of DNA .
To evaluate how soon the inducible binding can be observed after T-cell activation , we performed a time course with nuclear extracts prepared at increasing intervals after stimulation .
Figure 2A shows that there is progressive binding of a nuclear factor to the 5 ' oligonucleotide probe from 0 to 9 hours after PMA stimulation .
The binding kinetics over this site parallel the time course analysis observed for IL-3 transcription in MLA 144 cells . ''
Binding is specific , as it can be competed with excess unlabeled probe .
Other bands seen in lanes a through d represent nonspecific bindings as they fail to compete ( lane e ) .
In addition to its inducibility , one feature of the regulation of IL-3 transcription is its T-cell specificity .
To determine whether the protein that binds to the 5° element of ACT-1 is T-cell specific , nuclear extracts prepared from the human T-cell line Jurkat and from several PMA/ionomycin-stimulated hematopoietic cell lines were From www .

assayed for a nuclear factor that would bind the 5 ' probe ( Fig 2B and C ) .
Only in Jurkat cells did activation result in IL-3 expression ( data not shown ) .
The inducible binding activity was present in stimulated Jurkat cells ( Fig 2B ) .
Although many other bands can be seen , they represent nonspecific binding as they do not compete with excess unlabeled probe ( lane c ) and their intensity varies from experiment to experiment ( data not shown ) .
The inducible complex was not observed in other cell lines ( Fig 2C , lanes a through f ) , with the possible exception of U937 cells ( lane e ) , in which a weak complex was found to comigrate with the inducible binding detected in MLA 144 cells ( lane g ) .
In addition , nuclear extracts from human fibroblasts , similarly assayed , displayed no binding to the 5 ' probe ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the nuclear factor that binds to this 5 ' site is inducible , and appears to be T-cell specific .
In contrast , the constitutive binding over the 3 ' probe occurs in Raji , K562 , and U937 cells ( data not shown ) .
That complex is neither stimulation dependent nor T-cell specific .
As a nuclear factor that is present in multiple cell lines , the constitutive factor may be a known DNA-binding protein .
The sequence of its binding site was therefore studied for sequence homologies with known nuclear factor-binding elements .
The closest homologies noted were with the sequence between - 149 through -141 on the noncoding strand .
Five of eight nucleotide matches were identified with several known octamer-binding sites .
These include the published octamer-binding consensus sequence ( ATGCAAAT ) '' ' as well as the two Oct-l-binding sites present in the human IL-2 promoter , namely , NFIL-2D ( ATGAATTA ) and ARRE-1 ( ATGTAAAA ) .
* '' Having made this observation , we tested the binding of the ACT-1 constitutive factor to oligonucleotides of these sequences .
The results , shown in Fig 3A , demonstrate that binding of the constitutive factor is competed by the Oct-1 consensus sequence ( lane c ) and is partially competed by the NFIL-2D sequence ( lane d ) .
Binding is not competed by a nonspecific oligonucleotide sequence ( lane e ) .
Thus , the constitutive factor shares an affinity for the same DNA binding sites as Oct-1 .
To confirm that the constitutive factor is an octamer-binding protein , we obtained antiserum known to react with Oct-1 .
The antiserum was added to a mobility shift reaction with stimulated Jurkat cell nuclear extract either before or after addition of the 3 ' probe .
Figure 3B demonstrates that the antiserum blocks binding of the constitutive factor to the probe ( lanes b and c ) .
Addition of this antiserum under the same conditions had no effect on the binding of the repressor NIP complex to its cognate probe ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the inhibition of binding is specific to the constitutive factor , suggesting that the anti-Oct-1 antibody interacts with it .
In contrast , binding of the inducible , T-cell-specific factor to the 5 ' probe is neither competed by octamer binding se-quences , nor affected by anti-Oct-l antiserum ( data not shown ) .
Although this factor is distinct from Oct-1 , its binding From www .

932 site is physically linked to an octamer-binding site , an arrangement that is analogous to the ARRE-1 element that participates in the inducible expression of IL-2 by T cells .
This raised the possibility that the two sites might share similar protein-binding specificities .
Indeed , when the OAP binding site of the IL-2 promoter is used as a competitor for binding to the ACT-1 5 probe , it works as efficiently as the 5 ' probe itself ( Fig 3C , lanes b and c ) .
Functional assays .
- Functionally , the ACT-1 element is known to upregulate the inducible expression of the IL-3 gene .
To determine the individual roles of the two distinct binding elements , we transiently transfected into MLA 144 cells a reporter gene linked to selectively mutated IL-3 promoter sequences and assayed for the level of inducible expression of the reporter gene mRNA .
Because the activity of the AP-1 and NIP elements may overshadow the effects of the individual ACT-1 elements on the level of reporter gene expression , constructs were made that did not include AP-1 or NIP .
To this end , the promoter was truncated at position -173 .
Figure 4 shows that the -173 promoter is sufficient to promote IL-3 expression ( lane a ) .
Expression of this construct was not observed in the absence of MLA 144 cell activation or when it was introduced into stimulated fibroblasts ( data not shown ) .
When the ACT -1 element in this construct is replaced with a BamHI linker , expression is completely lost ( lane b ) , suggesting that ACT-1 , as a whole , is an essential positive regulatory element within the first 173 bp of the promoter .
When the constitutive factor binding site ( nt -146 through -139 ) is replaced by a BamHI linker ( lane c ) , the level of IL-3 expression is equivalent to that seen with the intact -173 construct .
Truncation of the promoter at position -149 , which leaves intact the constitutive element but deletes the inducible element of ACT -1 , decreases by half the expression observed with the -173 construct ( data not shown ) .
Together , these transient transfection and DNA-binding experiments point to the 5 half of ACT-1 as a key element in the inducible , T-cell-specific expression of IL-3 .
The role of the 3 ' , constitutive element is less clear ; however , taken in the context of the whole -315 promoter , which includes the AP-1 and NIP elements , it plays a noticeable role in maximizing IL-3 expression .
When the constitutive site is replaced with a BamHI linker in an otherwise intact -315 promoter construct ( lane e ) , there is a decrease in IL-3 expression as compared with the level of expression of the wild-type -315 construct ( lane d ) .
Interestingly , no further reduction in expression is observed when the whole ACT -1 site in the -315 promoter is replaced by a BamHI linker ( lanes f and g ) .
No expression of the -315 construct was detected in the absence of stimulation or after introduction into fibroblasts® ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION IL-3 is involved in the hematopoietic response to antigenic challenge by causing proliferation and differentiation of early precursors of multiple hematopoietic cell lines .
It seems likely that dysregulation of IL-3 expression may be responsible for one or more disorders of hematopoiesis .
To be able to recognize dysregulation of IL-3 expression , one must first understand the normal regulatory controls affecting its expres- DAVIES ET AL sion .
Because IL-3 expression is regulated in part at the level of transcription , we have directed our research toward discovering the molecular basis of IL-3 gene regulation at the level of the promoter .
The ACT-1 ( or NF-IL3-A ) element has been shown to mediate inducible and T-cell-specific expression of IL-3 and to be a site of nuclear factor binding .
It binds not one but two nuclear factors .
The more 5° part of the element binds an inducible factor detected thus far only in stimulated T cells .
An oligonucleotide directed against the DNA-binding site of OAP in the IL-2 promoter can efficiently compete for its binding to the IL-3 probe .
The more 3 ' part binds a constitutive factor present in both unstimulated and stimulated T cells and also present in all other cell lines assayed .
This constitutive factor appears to be Oct-1 or a closely related protein .
The binding characteristics of ACT-1 are therefore reminiscent of those of the ARRE-1 site in the IL-2 promoter , '' which will be discussed later .
The functional roles of the inducible and constitutive binding sites are somewhat complex .
We have found that mutation of the whole ACT-1 element ( nt -154 through -139 ) within an otherwise intact -315 promoter diminishes but does not ablate IL-3 expression .
Yet , the same mutation in the -173 promoter does result in complete loss of gene expression .
To evaluate the functional roles of the two sites within ACT-1 , without the added complexity of the upstream elements , we examined the functional activity of several truncated promoters that had been mutated at selected sites .
When the constitutive binding site is selectively mutated in the context of the -173 promoter , the ability of the promoter to induce gene expression is not diminished in comparison to the intact -173 promoter .
The role of the constitutive site is only apparent when the full promoter is used .
That role seems to be a cooperative one with other promoter elements to maximize IL-3 expression .
The organization and function of the ACT site show striking parallels with those of the ARRE-1 site in the IL-2 promoter .
As noted earlier , the constitutive site appears to bind Oct-1 or a related octamer-binding protein .
Like IL-3 , IL-2 is a cytokine expressed only by activated T cells .
ARRE-1 is a site that constitutively binds Oct- !
over its 3 ' part and inducibly binds a second protein ( OAP ) over its 5 ' part .
This similarity in binding behavior takes on added importance as we demonstrate that the T-cell-specific , inducible factor that binds ACT-1 recognizes the OAP '' -binding site of ARRE-1 .
In addition , the two factors appear to be functionally related .
When ARRE- !
is isolated from the other elements of the promoter , OAP binding but not Oct-1 binding is important for efficient , inducible expression of a reporter gene . ''
However , in the context of the full IL-2 promoter , the Oct-1 site and the OAP site are almost equivalent in their contribution to promoting gene transcription .
However , there is one notable difference .
In contrast to the Oct-1-facilitated binding of OAP to the ARRE-1 site , we have not been able to see the inducible and constitutive complexes bind simultaneously to the same ACT probe .
This may suggest that the inducible factor and OAP '' may be different proteins .
Alternatively , nucleotide differences in the binding sequences between the two promoters may dictate different binding af-finities .

Lanes a through c , d and e , and f and g represent independent RNase protection experiments .
The close relationship between the ACT-1 and ARRE-1 elements both in terms of binding and function for the regulated expression of IL-3 and IL-2 , respectively , is only one such parallel .
Several cis-acting elements of the IL-3 promoter appear to be functionally dependent on one another to op-timally regulate gene expression .
This is a pattern that is surfacing in many promoter systems .
Again , comparison between the IL-3 and IL-2 promoters shows that , although they do not share significant sequence homologies , they do share a common arrangement of similar binding elements .
In par-ticular , they each contain a module characterized by an AP-1 site upstream , an octamer/octamer-associated protein site ( ACT-1 and ARRE-1 ) downstream , and a negative regulatory element in the middle ( NIP and NRE-A ) . ''
This shared pattern of regulatory elements may be at the core of the shared regulatory mechanisms by which T-cell activation induces transcription of these genes .
Elements not shared by the two promoters may result in the differences in regulation of the two genes .
In the IL-3 promoter , the AP-1 site and the inducible site in ACT-1 have somewhat redundant functions , but these functions appear to augment one another in the intact promoter .
The repressor element between AP-1 and ACT-1 also interacts with these other promoter elements .
Furthermore , there appear to be elements downstream of ACT-1 , as yet uncharacterized , that may influence the function of these other elements .
The multiple regulatory sites with overlapping and interdependent functions certainly must be crucial for maintaining the tight control over gene expression that is necessary for the important biologic role that IL-3 and IL-2 play in controlling hematopoiesis and T-cell pro-liferation , respectively .
