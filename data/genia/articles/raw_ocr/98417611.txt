Altered DNA-binding specificity mutants of EKLF and Spl show that EKLF is an activator of the B-globin locus control region in vivo Nynke Gillemans , Rita Tewari , Fokke Lindeboom , Robbert Rottier , Ton de Wit , Mark Wijgerde , Frank Grosveld , '' and Sjaak Philipsen Erasmus University Rotterdam , Medical Genetics Center-Department of Cell Biology , 3000 DR Rotterdam , The Netherlands The locus control region of the B-globin cluster contains five DNase I hypersensitive sites ( 5'HS1-5 ) required for locus activation .
5 ! HS3 contains six G-rich motifs that are essential for its activity .
Members of a protein family , characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in transcription factor Sp1 , interact with these motifs .
Because point mutagenesis can not distinguish between family members , it is not known which protein activates 5'HS3 .
We show that the function of such closely related proteins can be distinguished in vivo by matching point mutations in 5'HS3 with amino acid changes in the zinc fingers of Sp1 and EKLF .
Testing their activity in transgenic mice shows that EKLF is a direct activator of 5HS3 .

The human B-globin cluster contains five structural genes in the order 5'-e ( embryonic ) -Gy-Ay ( fetal ) -6-B ( adult ) -3 ' .
Expression of these genes is completely dependent on the presence of the locus control region ( LCR ) , a 20-kb sequence located upstream of the e-globin gene ( for review , see Grosveld et al .
1993 ) .
The LCR is characterized by the presence of five erythroid-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites , termed 5'HS1-5 .
The activity of the LCR resides in the hypersensitive areas ( Grosveld et al .
1993 ) .
Our previous work has focused on the functional dissection of 5HS3 of the LCR .
It is the strongest activator when single hypersensitive sites are linked to the B-globin gene ( Fraser et al .
1990 ) , and it appears to have a dominant chromatin-opening activity ( Ellis et al .
1996 ) .
The 225-bp core fragment coinciding with the hypersensitive site retains the essential properties of 5'HS3 ( Philipsen et al .
1990 ) .
This core contains three footprinted binding sites for the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1 , alternated with three footprinted G-rich sequences or G boxes ( Philipsen et al .
1990 ; Strauss and Orkin 1992 ) .
The smallest fragment capable of activating a B-globin gene in transgenic mice consists of footprints 1-3 ( fp 1-3 ) of the core fragment ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
Fp 1 and 3 are GATA-1 binding sites , and fp 2 contains G boxes that are bound by multiple factors .

Point mutations in fp 1 and 3 have shown that intactness of these sequences is absolutely essential for activity .
From this , we concluded that GATA-1 binds to fp 1 and 3 in vivo .
In contrast , point mutations abolishing binding of single factors to the G boxes of fp 2 could not be designed ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
The G boxes are bound by members of a transcription factor family characterized by the presence of three zinc fingers highly hom olo-gous to those found in Spl .
The Spl family includes ubiquitously expressed proteins like Spl ( Kadonaga et al .
1987 ) , Sp3 ( Hagen et al .
1992 ; Kingsley and Winoto 1992 ) , basic transcription element binding protein ( BTEBs ; Imataka et al .
1992 ) and basic Kriippel-like factor ( BKLF ; Crossley et al .
1996 ) , and tissue-restricted factors like gut-enriched Kriippel-like factor ( GKLF ; Shields et al .
1996 ) , lung Kriippel-like factor ( LKLF ; Anderson et al .
1995 ) , and erythroid Kriippel-like factor ( EKLF ; Miller and Bieker 1993 ) .
Moreover , a large num ber of Spl-like zinc finger domains can be found in the expressed sequence tag ( EST ) databases .
Fp 2 is bound in vitro by Sp1 , Sp3 , BKLF , EKLF , and other as yet uncharacterized family members , present in erythroid nuclear extracts ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ; N. Gillemans , unpubl . ) .
This plethora of transcription factors precludes a straightforward interpretation of the relationship between binding sites and activators , and thus it is not known which protein binds to fp 2 in vivo .

presents a general problem in the interpretation of gene expression data .
The analysis of knockout mice is a first step toward the solution of this problem ( e.g. , Nuez et al .
1995 ; Perkins et al .
1995 ; Marin et al .
1997 ; Tewari et al .
1998 ) , but this approach can only provide indirect an-swers .
Pioneering work in Drosophila has established that a DNA-binding specificity mutant can be used as a tool to demonstrate direct interaction of a transcription factor and a DN A target site in a multicellular organism ( Schier and Gehring 1992 ) .
In this paper we have applied this approach to mice , utilizing the minimal fragment of 5'HS3 to test the role of putative activator proteins ( Spl and EKLF ) directly .
First , we mutated the G boxes in fp 2 so they no longer bind Spl family members in vitro .
Second , we designed zinc fingers recognizing the mutated sequence in fp 2 .
We then tested the capacity of the engineered factors ( mSpl and mEKLF ) to activate the mutant fp 2 construct in transgenic mice .
The results show that EKLF but not Spl activates fp 2 of 5'HS3 , and we conclude that EKLF plays a very specific role in the activity of 5'HS3 and in the activation of the B-globin locus .
Results Experim ental strategy We have used human B-globin gene activation by the minimal fragment of 5'HS3 as the experimental system ( Fig .
1A ) .
The functional importance of the GAT sites in fp 1 and 3 and the G boxes in fp 2 ( Fig .
1B ) has been analyzed extensively in transgenic mice ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
The results of these experiments show that all three footprinted sequences are required for activation of a linked B-globin gene .
Spl family members recognize a 9-bp sequence GGG GT/CG GGG ( Letovsky and Dynan 1989 ) and thus it could be predicted that fp 2 contains two overlapping binding sites , in addition to potential weaker binding sites ( Fig .
1B , wild type ) .
To minimize the complexity of fp 2 , we first determined whether one binding site would suffice for activation .
Two mutants with only one binding site ( Fig .
1B , 5 ' and 3 '' ) were made by disrupting every other potential binding site by G -T transversions ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
These mutants were placed in their natural context between fp 1 and 3 and the resulting fragments were tested for their capacity to activate the B-globin gene in transgenic mice .
Founder fetuses were dissected at 13.5 days of gestation ( E13.5 ) , and DNA was prepared from the head , yolk sac , and placenta to determine the transgene copy number and to check for mosaicism ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
RN A was isolated from the livers of nonmosaic transgenic fe-tuses , and the level of human B-globin mRNA was quantitated with S1 nuclease protection analysis using the level of the endogenous B-major mRNA as an internal control ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
The expression level per transgene copy was set at 100 for the wild-type fp 1-3 construct ( Fig .
1B ) .
The constructs with only one G box in fp 2 are expressed at approximately twofold lower levels than those observed with the wild-type fp 1-3 con 2864 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 kb 1 ko Exp .

struct .
Thus , we conclude that each G box contributes to the activity of fp 1-3 .
Because the 3 ' sequence has the best match with the Spl consensus binding site ( Letovsky and Dynan 1989 ) , we concentrated on this mo-tif .
For reasons of clarity , we will refer to this perm uta-tion of fp 2 as control ( ct in Fig .
1B ) , hereafter .
The zinc fingers of Spl family members are structurally closely related to those of the Zif268 protein ( Na-rayan et al .
1997 ; Sjottem et al .
1997 ) .
From the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of Zif268 it is known that one zinc finger occupies 3 bp in the recognition sequence ( Pavletich and Pabo 1991 ) .
We therefore assumed that fingers 1 and 3 recognize the triplet GGG , and finger 2 the triplet GTG in fp 2 ( Fig .
1B ) .
Hence , mutation of GGG to GTG triplets should interfere with recognition by fingers 1 and 3 of Spl family members .
We tested the activity of this fp 2 mutant in transgenic mice .
The analysis of eight founder fetuses shows that the fp 2 mutant results in a further fourfold reduction of B-globin reporter expression as compared with control fp 2 ( Fig .
1B ) .
These data are consistent with earlier observations in transgenic mice containing more drastic mutations in fp 2 ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
Thus , we conclude that the lower expression level is due to decreased binding of an activator protein to the mutant fp 2 sequence and that the fp 2 mutant could be used to test the transcriptional effect of modified activator proteins engineered to bind specifically to this sequence .
Construction of transcription factors with altered DNA-binding site specificity We set out to change the DNA-binding site specificity of two candidate activators of 5'HS3 : Sp1 , the ubiquitously expressed archetypal transcription factor , and EKLF , the only erythroid-specific Spl family member described to date .
The fp 2 mutant contains a 9-bp sequence consisting of three GTG triplets ( Fig .
1B ) .
In wild-type Spl family mem bers , zinc finger 2 recognizes this sequence ( Li et al .
1991 ; Feng et al .
1994 ; Narayan et al .
1997 ; Sjottem et al .
1997 ) .
Thus , if we would change the specificity of fingers 1 and 3 of EKLF and Spl to that of finger 2 , we EKLF but not Sp1 is an activator of the LCR should obtain proteins that interact specifically with the fp 2 mutant .
However , such changes may have unexpected consequences .
A simple triplication of finger 2 of Spl binds to such a sequence albeit with reduced affinity ( Desjarlais and Berg 1993 ) , which might be due to structural determinants provided by fingers 1 and 3 , and/or the spacer amino acids between the fingers ( Jacobs 1992 ; Choo and Klug 1993 ; Isalan et al .
1997 ) .
In addition , zinc fingers are involved in protein-protein interactions ( Perkins et al .
1994 ; Merika and Orkin 1995 ) and notably , the interactions with GATA-1 are of direct relevance to this work ( Merika and Orkin 1995 ) .
Therefore , we substituted the minimum number of amino acids in the recognition helices of fingers 1 and 3 to make their DNA-binding specificity identical to that of finger 2 of Spl ( Pavletich and Pabo 1991 ; Narayan et al .
1997 ; Sjottem et al .
1997 ) .
No other changes to the zinc finger domains of Spl and EKLF were made to preserve presumptive functions other than direct DNA recognition ( Fig .
2A ; m Spl and m EKLF ) .
The mutant transcription factors are transcriptional activators First , we determined whether m EKLF and mSp1 would be active as transcriptional activators in a binding site A Finger 1 Finger 2 Finger 3 Figure 2 .

dependent manner .
We inserted the control and mutant binding site 20 bp upstream of the TATA box in the promoter of the OVEC test vector ( Westin et al .
1987 ) to assess the capacity of the factors to act as classical transcriptional transactivators .
The cDNAs encoding the factors were cloned in the expression vector pRe/CMV .
These constructs were cotransfected in CHO cells with the OVEC test vectors and the OVEC-REF vector , which serves as an internal control for transfection efficiency .
RNA was isolated 72 hr after transfection , and the RN A synthesized from the OVEC test- and OVEC-REF vectors was quantitated by RNase protection analysis ( Westin et al .
1987 ) .
This shows that increasing the amount of mSpl stimulates transcription of the OVEC vector with the mutant binding site ( OVEC-mt ; Fig .
2B ) but not of the OVEC vector with the control binding site ( O VEC -ct ; Fig .
2B ) .
On the contrary , Spl has no effect on transcription of the OVEC-mt construct but stimulates transcription of the OVEC-ct construct ( Fig .
2B ) .
Transactivation by Spl appears to be less effective than that observed with mSp1 ( Fig .
2B ) , most likely because of competition with transcriptional repressors like Sp3 for binding to the control sequence but not the mutant sequence ( Hagen et al .
1994 ) .
A very similar result is obtained with m EKLEF transactivation ( Fig .
2B ; data not shown ) .
We conclude that the altered DNA-binding specificity mutants of EKLF and Spl are functional transcriptional activators that can stimulate transcription through the mutant fp 2 sequence in vivo .
Erythroid-specific expression and DNA-binding properties of the transcription factors To express the transcription factors in red cells , we cloned cDNAs encoding the wild-type and mutant proteins in the erythroid-specific expression vector pEV3 ( Needham et al .
1992 ) , resulting in Sp1-pEV , m Sp1-pEV , EKLE-pEV , and m EKLFE-pEV ( Fig .
2C ) .
Murine erythro-leukaemia ( MEL ) cells were stably transfected with these constructs to check for the expression and DN A-binding properties of the transgene-derived transcription factors ( Fig .
3A ; data not shown ) ; they were then used to generate transgenic mice .
For each construct , one transgenic line was analyzed further ; these lines will be referred to as Sp1l-pEV , m Sp1l-pEV , EKLF-pEV , and m EKLF-pEV .
The expression levels of transgene-derived transcription factors were assessed by Western blot analysis of E13.5 fetal liver extracts .
The blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against EKLF or Sp1 .
The epitopes recognized by these antibodies are amino-terminal to the zinc finger domains and they therefore detect both the wild-type and mutant transcription factors .
As a loading control , the blots were reprobed with a rat monoclonal antibody specific for the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1 .
The results show that the expression levels of the transgene-derived transcription factors are comparable to those of the endogenous factors , as we observe a moderate ( approximately two-fold ) increase of the signals in the transgenic samples , Figure 3 .

2866 GENES & DEVELOPMENT relative to the GATA-1 control ( Fig .
2D ) .
We conclude that the transgene-derived transcription factors are expressed at physiological levels , thus allowing comparison of the biological effects of these factors .
Protein extracts derived from transfected MEL cells and E13.5 transgenic livers were used for gel retardation analysis with oligonucleotide probes containing the control or the mutant fp 2 sequence .
Transfected MEL cell extracts show that transgene-derived Spl and EKLF proteins bind to the control fp 2 sequence ( Fig .
3A ) ; this could not be demonstrated in fetal liver extracts because of the large background caused by other proteins present in these extracts ( data not shown ) .
Very little , if any , specific binding to the mutant fp 2 oligonucleotide is observed with extracts from Sp1l-pEV fetal livers ( Fig .
3B ) , or with extracts from EKLEF-pEV and nontransgenic livers ( data not shown ) .
Thus , Sp1 family members do not appear to interact efficiently with the mutant sequence , in agreement with the functional data obtained in transgenic mice ( Fig .
1B ) and CHO cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast , transgene-derived m Sp1 and m EKLF proteins do interact with the mutant fp 2 sequence .
The specificity of these interactions is demonstrated by the addition of competitor oligonucleotides and antibodies to the reactions ( Fig .
3B , C ) .
Thus , we conclude that mEKLF and mSpl bind specifically to the mutant fp 2 sequence in vitro and not to the control fp 2 sequence , whereas the opposite is true for wild-type EKLF and Spl .
Functional analysis in transgenic mice To analyze the effect of EKLF and Spl on the activity of fp 1-3 constructs in transgenic mice , we generated reporter mice with the control or the mutant fp 1-3 fragment driving expression of the human B-globin gene ( see Fig .
1 ) .
For each construct , two independent lines were established .
These lines were crossed with the Sp1-pEV , mSpl-pEV , EKLE-pEV , and m EKLE-pEV lines , and the effect of transgene-derived transcription factors on human B-globin gene expression was determined by quantitative S1 nuclease protection analysis ( Fig .
4 ; Table 1 ) .
The level of mouse -globin mRNA was used as an internal control .
Expression of the control reporter gene is not altered by the presence of Sp/I-pEV , m Sp/I-pEV , EK-LFE-pEV , or m EKLF-pEV transgenes .
Thus , the transgene-derived transcription factors have no influence on the control reporter gene , excluding the possibility of a dominant effect on reporter gene expression .
In contrast , the expression levels of the mutant reporter gene are affected by m EKLF , but not by Spl , mSpl , and EKLF .
This demonstrates that the observed differences are dependent on the altered zinc finger domains of mEKLF and that the effect is specific to EKLF , as mSpl has no influence on the mutant reporter gene .
Expression of the mutant reporter gene is increased threefold in the presence of m EKLF , approaching the level observed with the control construct ( Fig .
4 ; Table 1 ) .
From this we conclude that EKLF directly activates 5'HS3 by binding to fp 2 in vivo .
Interestingly , the mSpl1 protein has no effect on B-globin gene expression through fp 2 of 5'HS3 , even EKLF but not Sp1 is an activator of the LCR 5 C - & 3 Z - R 5 C alls a © x d a © z W Transcrpbon factor .

Quantitative S1 nuclease protection assay of human B-globin transgene expression .
RNA was isolated from E13.5 fetal livers containing the mutant or the control B-globin reporter construct and the Sp1- , mSpl- , EKLF- , or mEKLF-pEV transgenes as indicated .
One microgram of RNA was used for the S1 nuclease protection assay with probes detecting endogenous mouse « -globin mRNA ( m-a ) and human B-globin mRNA ( h-B ) .
An increased level of human B-globin mRNA is only observed for the mutant reporter in the presence of m EKLF ( lane 6 ) ; no changes are found in any of the other combinations .
Lane 13 contains 3 ug of the RNA sample used in lane 7 to demonstrate probe excess .
though it is a functional activator when the mutant binding site is placed in the context of the promoter of the OVEC vector ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , it appears that the specific combination of GATA-1 bound at fp 1 and 3 and EKLF bound at fp 2 is required for the activity of 5'HS3 in erythroid cells .
Analysis of reporter gene expression at the single cell level The S1 nuclease protection assay described above provides a quantitative measurement of reporter gene expression in populations of cells .
Therefore , the reporter gene might be expressed at a high level in a subset of the cells and not in the remaining cells .
In this scenario , m EKLF would act by increasing the fraction of cells expressing the mutant reporter gene .
Alternatively , the reporter gene might be expressed in the large majority of erythroid cells , in which case m EKLF could exert its effect by increasing the rate and/or the duration of active transcription of the mutant reporter gene ( Milot et al .

1996b ) .
To distinguish between these possibilities , we analyzed reporter gene expression at the single cell level by primary transcript in situ hybridization ( Wijgerde et al .
1995 ) .
Oligonucleotide probes detecting nuclear transcription spots of the endogenous a-globin genes were used to determine the num ber of erythroid cells ( Tewari et al .
1996 ) .
Human -globin nuclear transcription signals were visualized with four oligonucleotides derived from intron 1 ; as two of these probes overlap partially with exon sequences , cytoplasmic -globin mRNA can also be detected ( Dillon et al .
1997 ) .
The presence of cytoplasmic mRNA shows that a cell has expressed the transgene at some point in time , whereas the presence of nuclear precursor RN A at the site of transcription is indicative of active transcription because precursor RN As are rapidly processed ( Wijgerde et al .
1995 ) .
The results of this analysis are summarized in Figure 5 and Table 2 .
Cells expressing m EKLF show a three- to fourfold increased num ber of nuclei with transcriptional foci of the mutant reporter gene .
Moreover , the cytoplasm of the cells shows a more intense red staining than cells with just the mutant reporter construct , reflecting the increased amounts of human B-globin mRNA in the presence of m EKLF .
Human -globin signals are not affected if m Spl is expressed in these cells , in agreement with the S1 nuclease analysis .
All cells with the control reporter gene contain B-globin mRNA in the cytoplasm , as do cells with the mutant reporter containing m EKLF .
Expression of any of the transcription factors has no effect on the control reporter gene , nor does expression of Spl or EKLF have any effect on the mutant reporter gene , in agreement with the S1 nuclease data .
Thus , the in situ hybridization analysis shows that the fp 1-3 reporter transgenic lines used in this study do not show classical position effect variegation .
Such effects can be observed when LCR mutants in the context of the 70-kb B-globin locus are integrated in heterochromatic regions ( Milot et al .
1996b ) .
The fact that we observe primary transcription signals in only part of the cells shows that transcription of the reporter genes is discon-tinuous .
Importantly , mEKLF appears to activate the mutant reporter gene in all cells because the cytoplasmic staining increases in all cells ( Fig .
5 ) .

The probes for human B-globin also detect cytoplasmic mRNA ; this is particularly evident in the mutant reporter/mEKLF and the control reporter cells .

The error margin was < 10 % .
DNase I hypersensitivity analysis The core fragments of the LCR coincide with strong , erythroid-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites .
In E13.5 liver cells of the reporter lines a hypersensitive site is found at the control fp 1-3 sequence , whereas a weaker hypersensitive site is found at the mutant fp 1-3 sequence ( data not shown ) .
Thus , we asked whether binding of mEKLFE to the mutant fp 1-3 sequence would result in increased DNase I hypersensitivity .
To investigate this , nuclei isolated from transgenic E13.5 liver cells were subjected to a DN ase I fade-out analysis ( see Ellis et al .
1996 ) .
Purified DNA of these DNase I series was digested with Nco !
and Southern blotted ( Fig .
6 ) .
In the absence of m EKLF , a weak hypersensitive site is detectable at the mutant fp 1-3 area ( Fig .
6B , mutant ) ; hypersensitivity is increased modestly in the compound transgenic ( Fig .
6B , mutant + m EKLPF ) .
As a control for DNase I digestion , the same blot was stripped and rehybridized with a probe detecting a 0.85-kb fragment of the mouse a , -globin gene , as DN ase I sensitivity of this gene should not be affected by m EKLF ( Fig .
6B , bottom ) .
Quantitation of the signals in the hypersensitive site area relative to the corresponding mouse a , -globin signals indicates that hypersensitivity is increased two- to threefold in the presence of m EKLF ( Fig .

data that direct binding of EKLF is implicated in the chromatin remodeling activity of 5'HS3 of the -globin LCR ( Ellis et al .
1996 ) .
EKLF but not Sp1 is an activator of the LCR Discussion Binary transgenic systems In this paper we have used binary transgenic mice to investigate the apparent redundancy of transcription factors binding to an important genetic element , 5'HS3 of the B-globin LCR .
Our approach encompasses the use of engineered zinc finger transcription factors rationally designed to recognize a mutated binding site in 5'HS3 .
Several binary systems for regulating gene expression have been described , for instance , the yeast GAL4/UAS , the bacterial tet-repressor/operator , and steroid-inducible systems ( Ornitz et al .
1991 ; Gossen et al .
1995 ; No et al .
1996 ; Wang et al .
1997 ) .
Furthermore , an engineered zinc finger domain recognizing a unique region of the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene has been shown to impair the expression of this oncogene in transformed cells after transient transfection in culture ( Choo et al .
1994 ) .
Our data show that engineered zinc finger transcription factors are particularly useful tools for the study of tissue-specific activation of gene expression in transgenic mice .
Transcription factors with altered binding specificities Previously , it has been shown that the DNA-binding specificity of the Drosophila fushi tarazu ( fiz ) protein can be altered by changing a single amino acid in its homeodomain .
This was used to demonstrate direct autoregulation through binding of the fiz mutant to mutant DNA target sites in a regulatory element of the fz gene , establishing that this in vivo approach can be used to distinguish between activities of homeodomain proteins with very similar binding site specificities ( Schier and Gehring 1992 ) .
Most transcription factors are mem bers of families classified by highly conserved DNA-binding domains .
Members of such families recognize very similar or even identical DNA sequences and are often found in the same cell types .
This suggests that family members may have overlapping arrays of target genes , and in many cases it has proved impossible to show which factor activates which gene .
5'HS3 of the B-globin LCR is a good example of this problem .
The core fragment contains three GATA footprints interspersed by three footprints over G boxes ; fp 1-3 of the core are minimally required for activity in transgenic mice ( Philipsen et al .
1990 , 1993 ) .
Because GATA-1 is the only GATA family member present at late stages of erythroid differentiation , point mutagenesis and in vivo footprinting analyses have demonstrated convincingly that GATA-1 interacts with the GATA sites of fp 1 and 3 in vivo ( Strauss and Orkin 1992 ; Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
In contrast , the G boxes of fp 2 are bound in vitro by a num ber of different proteins belonging to the Sp1 family ( Philipsen et al .
1990 , 1993 ) .
These proteins have very similar binding sites , and no mutations specific for individual factors could be made ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
To resolve this issue , we have introduced compensatory mutations in the zinc finger domains of the Spl family members Spl and EKLF designed to interact with a mutated G box in fp 2 .
Our data show that m EKLF activates GENES & DEVELOPMENT 2869 Gillemans et al .
the mutated 5'HS3 fragment in binary transgenic mice by binding directly to the fp 2 mutant in vivo .
In contrast , m Spl does not act as an activator in this context , even though it interacts specifically with the fp 2 mutant in vitro and is a functional transactivator through this binding site in the context of the promoter of the OVEC vector .
We conclude that specific properties of EKLF are required for activation of 5'HS3 .
Our data do not rule out that other factors are also capable of activating 5'HS3 .
Possible candidates are other Spl family members such as BKLF and Sp3 ( Hagen et al .
1992 ; Crossley et al .
1996 ) , or the recently described multitype zinc finger protein Friend of GAT ( Tsang et al .
1997 ) .
It remains possible that such proteins function as activators of 5'HS3 through direct interaction with the wild-type fp 2 sequence .
Furthermore , the reporter genes are present as multicopy concatemers , and thus synergism among the multiple insertions might occur .
Therefore , it will be of interest to test the activity of mutant binding sites/mu-tant transcription factor combinations in the structural context of single copy integrants of the complete human B-globin locus ( Strouboulis et al .
1992 ) .
It is likely that replacement of fp 2 with a completely artificial binding site will have a stronger effect on the remaining activity of fp 1-3 ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
The construction of novel zinc finger domains recognizing the artificial site would be required to activate such a mutant reporter gene .
Recently , it has been shown that the specificity of zinc finger domains can be changed efficiently by successive rounds of affinity selection through randomization of the recognition helix of each finger ( Greisman and Pabo 1997 ) .
Thus , a second generation of mutant Spl family members could be designed that interacts with a completely arbitrary sequence in fp 2 , resulting in more stringent activator/reporter combinations .
EKLF and activation of the -globin locus In this paper we have used binary transgenic mice to show that EKLF is an activator of the LCR that binds directly to fp 2 of 5 ! HS3 .
EKLF appears to function in a specific combination with GATA-1 bound at fp 1 and 3 , consistent with earlier results obtained with point mutations and deletions in 5'HS3 ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ; Pru-zina et al .
1994 ) .
Thus , we have identified an in vivo binding site for EKLF in the B-globin LCR .
Targeted inactivation of the EKLF gene in mice results in lethality around E14-15 caused by severe anemia due to failure to express the B-globin gene at appropriate levels ( Nuez et al .
1995 ; Perkins et al .
1995 ) .
The expression of other erythroid-specific genes examined , including the « -like and the embryonic/fetal B-like globins , is not affected showing that EKLF is essential for the activation of the adult B-globin promoter ( Nuez et al .
1995 ; Perkins et al .
1995 ; Wijgerde et al .
1996 ) .
In addition , we have demonstrated recently that the expression of 5'HS3-lacZ transgenes requires EKLF ( Tewari et al .
1998 ) , and DNase I hypersensitive site analysis of the human B-globin locus in the EKLF null background showed 2870 GENES & DEVELOPMENT strongly reduced sensitivity at the B-globin promoter and moderately reduced sensitivity at 5'HS3 ( Wijgerde et al .
1996 ) .
These data agree well with our observation that direct binding of mEKLF to the mutant fp 1-3 sequence results in elevated reporter gene expression and increased DNase I hypersensitivity at fp 1-3 .
We conclude that direct binding of EKLF is implicated in chromatin remodeling over 5'HS3 , the only LCR fragment that appears to have an intrinsic dominant chromatin opening activity ( Ellis et al .
1996 ) .
Deletion of 5'HS3 in the human or the mouse locus does not inactivate the LCR completely ( Hug et al .
1996 ; Milot et al .
1996b ) .
Deletion of 5'HS3 in the endogenous mouse locus results in a 30 % reduction of B gene expression in adult mice ( Hug et al .
1996 ) .
Natural mutations in the CACC box of the B-globin promoter result in a less severe reduction of B gene expression than observed in EKLF knockout mice ( Thein 1993 ; Perkins et al .
1996 ; Wijgerde et al .
1996 ) .
Thus , it appears that EKLF sites are necessary in both the promoter and the LCR and that these sites act independently of each other .
Remarkably , these interactions occur in a different context of other factors , and it is of interest to note that EKLF is not required for the activation of the y-globin promoter in fetal liver cells , whereas it is essential for B-globin promoter activity in the same cells ( Perkins et al .
1996 ; Wijgerde et al .
1996 ) .
Thus , we suggest that direct binding of EKLF to both the LCR and the B promoter is mandatory for high level transcription of the adult B-globin gene .
Outlook Direct binding of EKLF appears to be pivotal for the function of 5 ! HS3 and the B-globin promoter .
Therefore , mutation of both elements should result in a reporter gene that is expressed at extremely low levels in the absence of the appropriate m EKLF .
Rendering m EKLF steroid dependent by fusing it to a steroid-receptor ligand binding domain would give an additional level of control to study the kinetics of gene activation in erythroid cells .
The feasibility of steroid-inducible target gene expression in binary transgenic mice has been demonstrated ( Wang et al .
1997 ) .
Inducible activation of LCR-dependent gene expression provides an in vivo system that can be used to address different aspects of gene expression , for instance , recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter , interactions between the LCR and the promoter through DN A looping , and the potential link between transcriptional activation and DNA replication ( for review , see Milot et al .
1996a ; Ptashne and Gann 1997 ) .
We are currently exploring these issues in the context of the complete human B-globin locus ( Strouboulis et al .
1992 ) .
Materials and methods DNA constructs and transgenesis Mutations were introduced in the fp 1-3 region of 5'HS3 as described ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) , and linked to the Hpal-EcoRV fragment of the human B-globin gene .
The microinjection fragments were released from vector sequences by digestion with EcoRV , gel purified and used for transgenesis ( Kollias et al .
1986 ) .
Founder transgenics were either dissected at E13.5 ( Philipsen et al .
1990 , 1993 ; Talbot et al .
1989 ) or bred to obtain lines .
Intactness , mosaicism , and copy numbers of the transgenes were analyzed by Southern blotting ( Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
To change the binding specificity of fingers 1 and 3 of EKLF and Spl , the amino acid substitutions indicated in Figure 2A were introduced by PCR-mediated mutagenesis ; the sequence of the cloned PCR products was verified by dideoxy sequencing ( Sambrook et al .
1989 ) ; the mutated proteins were designated mEKLF and mSp1 .
For transfection experiments in CHO cells , cDNAs encoding Spl , mSp1 , and mEKLF were cloned in the Not !
site of the expression vector pRe/CMV ( Invitrogen ) .
Control and mutant binding sites were cloned in the site of the OVEC vector ( Westin et al .
1987 ) .
The integrity and orientation of the cloned oligonucleotides was determined by dideoxy se-quencing .
For erythroid-specific expression , the EKLF , m EKLF , Sp1 , and mSpl cDNAs were cloned in the vector pEV3 ( Needham et al .
1992 ) , resulting in EKLF-pEV , mEKLF-pEV , Sp1l-pEV , and mSp1l-pEV .
Microinjection fragments for transgenesis were obtained by digestion with Aafll and Asp718 .
Cell transfections CHO cells ( 0.5 x 10° ) were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method ( Graham and Van der Eb 1973 ) with 3 ug of OVEC test vector , 0.15 ug of OVEC-REF vector , and 0.1 , 0.5 , or 2 ug of the appropriate pRe/CMV expression vector , supplemented with pTZ to a total amount of 18 ug of DNA .
The cells were harvested after 72 hr and used to prepare RN A ( Antoniou 1991 ) .
MEL cells ( 25 x 10° ) were transfected by electroporation with 25 ug of pEV3 derivatives linearized with Scal .
After selection for G418 resistance , erythroid differentiation was induced by the addition of dimethylsulfoxide ( 2 % vol/vol ) to the media ( Antoniou 1991 ) .
After 4 days of induction , the cells were harvested and protein extracts were made according to Scholer et al .
( 1989 ) .
Fetal liver protein and RNA samples Fetal livers were dissected from E13.5 fetuses and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen .
RN A was isolated from frozen tissue samples as described ( Antoniou 1991 ; Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
Protein was extracted according to Scholer et al .
( 1989 ) and stored at -80°C .
Western blotting was performed as described , using 20 ug of protein per lane ( Marin et al .
1997 ) .
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing EKLF and Sp1 were used in 1:3000 and 1:1000 dilutions , respectively .
As a loading control , the blots were reprobed with a rat monoclonal antibody directed against GATA-1 ( N6 , cat .
no .
sc-265 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) used at 3 ng/ul .
Expression of the human B-globin transgene was quantitated by S1 nuclease analysis , using a probe specific for human B-globin mRNA , and probes detecting mouse B-major or mouse « -globin mRNA as the internal control ( Antoniou 1991 ; Philipsen et al .
1993 ) .
Gel retardation analysis Oligonucleotide probes covering fp 2 were labeled and annealed according to Wall et al .
( 1988 ) .
Double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added at the amounts indicated prior to the addition of extract to the reactions .
Polyclonal antibodies rec- EKLF but not Sp1 is an activator of the LCR ognizing Sp1 , Sp3 , and EKLF were used at 1:160 , 1:320 , and 1:40 dilutions in the binding reactions , respectively .
Incubation was for 30 min at room temperature .
The samples were loaded on 4 % polyacrylamide ( PAA ) / 0.5 % TBE gels and run at 300 V for 3 hr at 4°C .
Other details are described in Wall et al .
( 1988 ) .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are as follows ( only the sense strand is shown ) fp 2 control , 5-AGGTTCCAGT-GAGTTTGGGGTGGGGTCAGTG-3 ' ; fp 2 mutant , 5'-AG-GTTCCAGTGAGTTTGTGGTGGTGTCAGTG-3 ' ; and Spl , S'-ATAGTCCCGCCCCTAACTCCGCCCAT-3 ' .
Bases different from the wild-type sequence of fp 2 are underlined ; bases different between control fp 2 and mutant fp 2 are underlined and in boldface type .
Prim ary transcript in situ hybridization E13.5 livers from individual fetuses were disrupted in 150 ul of PBS .
Twenty microliters of this cell suspension was spotted onto a polylysine-coated slide and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde , 5 % acetic acid , for 20 min at room temperature .
The slides were then washed three times for 10 min in PBS and stored in 70 % ethanol at -20°C .
Two sets of probes were used for in situ hy-bridization .
Four biotinylated oligonucleotides were used to detect human B-globin transcription .
This probe mixture is directed against intron 1 ; two of the oligonucleotides overlap partially with exon sequences and thus cytoplasmic B-globin mRNA can also be detected ( Dillon et al .
1997 ) .
Three DIG-labeled mouse « -globin intron-specific oligonucleotides were used to reveal the erythroid cells ( Tewari et al .
1996 ) .
Hybrid-izations were done as described by Tewari et al .
( 1996 ) and Wijgerde et al .
( 1995 ) .
For antibody detection , the Tyramid amplification system of Dupont NEN was used ( Raap et al .
1995 ) .
For quantitation , at least 300 cells were scored for each slide .
The reproducibility of these data fell within a 10 % error margin .
The following oligonucleotides were used for in situ hybrid-izations : Human B-globin , 5-CTGTCTCCACATGCCCAGTT-TCTATGGTCTCCTTAAACCTGTCTTGTAA-3 ' , 5 TGGGAAAATAGACCAAAGGCAGAGAGAGTCAGTGCC-TATCAGAAAC-3 ' , 5-AGGGCAGTAACGGCAGACTCTCC-TCAGGAGTCAGGT-3 ' , and 5'-ATAACAGCATCAGGAGG-GACAGATCCCCAAAGGACTCA-3 ' ; Mouse a-globin , 5'-CA-CAGAAAAGCATAGTTAGAAGCGCCCACTGAGCGAGT- 5-AGCCCTTCCTAGGGGCCCAGATGC-CGCCTGCCAGGTCCC-3 ' , and 5-GCTCCCCTTCCTGG-GACCACTATGTCCCTGCCTTGGGCACGAGGACCC-3 ' .
DNase I hypersensitivity assay Ten E13.5 livers were used to isolate nuclei followed by treatment with increasing amounts of DNase I at 37°C ( Ellis et al .
1996 ) DNA was purified , digested with NcoI , and Southern blotted .
A 0.44-kb Hpal-Acel fragment from the B-globin promoter was used as a probe to detect the hypersensitive site at fp 1-3 .
A 0.6-kb BamHI-Sacl fragment of the mouse a , globin gene , detecting a 0.85-kb Nco !
fragment , was used as a control probe .
Quantitation was done on a PhosphorImager with Im ag-ecQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
