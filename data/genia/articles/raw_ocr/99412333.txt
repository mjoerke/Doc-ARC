However , only a few CD8 *-T-cell epitopes are known , with the majority being contained in the pp65 phosphoprotein , which is believed to dominate the CD8 *-T-cell response to HCMV .
Here , we have readdressed the issue of CD8 * T cells specific for the 72-kDa major immediate-early protein ( IE-1 ) , which is nonstructural but is found very early and throughout the replicative cycle .
Using a novel flow-cytometric assay , we were able to identify CD8 *-T-cell epitopes ( by IE-1 peptide-specific induction of cytokine synthesis ) and simultaneously measure the frequency of cells directed against them .
For this purpose , 81 pentadecamer peptides covering the complete 491-amino-acid sequence of IE-1 were tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-seropositive donors .
At least 10 new epitopes were identified , and the fine specificity and presenting HLA molecule of the first of them was determined .
The frequencies of CD8 * T cells directed against IE-1 were similar to those directed against pp65 in donors tested with known pp65-derived peptides .
Impor-tantly , additional testing of a corresponding set of peptides covering the complete sequence of pp65 on 10 of these donors identified individuals whose CD8 * T cells recognized IE-1 but not pp65 and vice versa , clearly illustrating that either protein may be a major target .
In summary , our results suggest that IE-1 is far more important as a CD8 *-T-cell target than current opinion suggests .
Primary infection with or reactivation of the human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a major complication after bone marrow transplantation and solid-organ transplantation , and in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( 11 , 19-21 , 24 ) .
Cell-mediated immunity plays an essential role in the control of persistent infection , induction of latency , and recovery from acute disease ( 11 , 14 , 15 , 19-21 , 24 ) .
Adoptive transfer of HCMV-specific CD8 *-T-cell clones in bone marrow transplant recipients has successfully prevented viremia and disease ( 11 , 20 , 21 , 24 ) , illustrating the importance of a sufficient CD8 * -T -cell response in particular .
Boosting the CD8 *-T-cell response with HCMV-derived peptides could potentially be a useful alternative to adoptive T-cell transfer in these patients .
In this regard , a previously defined HLA-2.1-pre-sented cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitope from the HCMV pp65 protein is being evaluated as a candidate for vaccination therapy ( 5 ) .
Unfortunately , to date , our knowledge of HCMV CD8 *-T-cell epitopes is limited to only a few , most of which originate from the pp65 lower matrix phosphoprotein ( UL83 ) ( 25 ) and some of which originate from the 72-kDa major immediate-early protein ( IE-1 ) ( 1 , 9 ) .
The presenting HLA molecules , as far as they are known , are HLA-A2 , HLA-B7 , HLA-B8 , HLA-B18 , and HLA-B35 ( 1 , 9 , 25 ) , so that only approximately 50 to 60 % of a Caucasian population could theoretically benefit * Corresponding author .

8179 from vaccinations or immune therapy based on these known epitopes .
Despite the existence of several CTL epitopes in IE-1 ( 1 , 9 ) and the observation of IE-1-directed CTL activity in early studies on the anti-HCMV T-cell response ( 2 ) , the pp65 phosphoprotein is presently believed to largely dominate the anti-HCMV CTL response ( 13 , 25 ) .
This is partly because structural proteins , such as pp65 , which is presented by infected cells prior to virus protein synthesis , are thought to be more effective targets per se than are nonstructural proteins ( such as IE-1 ) ( 13 ) .
That major histocompatibility complex class I-presented peptides are typically 9 amino acids long ( 16-18 ) was first revealed in 1991 ( 8 ) and later reflected in the use of at least nine overlaps in the design of peptides used for epitope mapping .
The only major study attempting to map CTL epitopes in IE-1 was in fact published in 1991 and used only six overlaps between adjacent peptides ( 1 ) .
Because pp65 had only recently been studied with regard to CTL epitopes by using a modern peptide design ( 25 ) , we chose IE-1 as the first HCMV protein to readdress the issue of CD8 * -T -cell epitopes by using a novel and very efficient flow cytometry-based method ( 12 ) .
This new method examines rapid peptide-specific induction of effector cytokine synthesis at the single-cell level ( 12 ) .
For this purpose , 81 15-amino-acid peptides ( nine overlaps between adjacent peptides ) derived from the 491-amino-acid protein sequence of IE-1 ( SwissProt accession no .
P13202 ) were tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from 20 HCMV-seropositive healthy blood donors .
At least 10 15-amino-acid peptides that induced gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) synthesis in subsets of donors were identified .
For the first one of these , we have now determined the minimal 8180 KERN ET AL .
epitope and the presenting HLA molecule .
Interestingly , the measured CD8 *-T -cell frequencies were of the same order of magnitude as those elicited by known pp65-derived peptides in HLA-A2- and HLA-B7-positive donors ( 12 ) .
More importantly even , additional testing with a corresponding set of 15-amino-acid peptides covering the complete sequence of pp65 in some of the donors identified several subjects with a strong CD8 *-T-cell response against IE-1 but not pp65 .
Conversely , we identified several donors who had no CD8 * -T -cell response to IE-1 but did show a response to pp6S5-derived peptides .
These results may have important implications with regard to the putative role of IE-1 as a factor in HCMV-associated immune system pathology .
In summary , our results suggest that in some individuals IE-1 may be of the same importance as pp65 , and in a subset who do not have pp65-specific CD8 * T cells , IE-1 may even dominate the CD8 * immune response ( possibly together with yet unidentified epitopes from other proteins ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Citrated blood was obtained from HLA-typed HCMV-seropositive ( immuno-globulin G IgG ) blood donors .
Following standard Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) density centrifugation , cells were washed with sterile phos-phate-buffered saline ( PBS ; Gibco-BRL ) , resuspended in RPMI 1640 ( Bio-chrom , Berlin , Germany ) containing 0.1 % ( wt/vol ) bovine serum albumin ( Bio-chrom ) and 50 mM glutamine ( Biochrom ) , and adjusted to 10 '' cells/ml .
Then 200 pl each of cell suspensions and peptide solutions ( 10 pg/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1 % bovine serum albumin ) were placed in Cellstar polystyrene tubes ( Greiner , Frickenhausen , Germany ) and placed in an incubator ( 5° slant ) at 37°C under a humidified 5 % CO ; atmosphere .
After 1 h , 1,600 pl of RPMI 1640 containing 12.5 % ( vol/vol ) fetal calf serum ( Biochrom ) , 50 mM glutamine , and 12.5 pg of brefeldin A ( Sigma , Munich , Germany ) per ml was added .
After an additional 5 h , the cells were washed with cold PBS , resuspended in PBS-1 mM EDTA ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) , incubated for 10 min at 37°C , and washed again with cold PBS .
After surface staining with monoclonal antibodies ( for 30 min at 4°C in the dark ) , the cells were fixed for 5 min at 37°C in PBS containing 4 % ( wt/vol ) paraformaldehyde ( Merck ) and washed in PBS prior to permeabilization ( permeabilizing solution ; Becton Dickinson , Heidelberg , Germany ) as specified by the manufacturer .
Following intracellular staining , the cells were washed in PBS and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) by using the CellQuestTM software package .
Unstimulated samples were analyzed to verify the effect of stimulation .
Data files were analyzed with CellQuest or Paint-a-Gate software ( Becton Dickinson ) .
On day 1 , candidate peptides were selected according to the results obtained with pooled peptides .
These candidate peptides were tested individually on day 2 .
For that purpose , PBMC from day 1 were kept in a standard incubator .
Stimulation was performed with individual peptides by the same method as on day 1 , ic. , with the same concentration of individual peptides as within the peptide pool .
Parallel stimulation with ( noncandidate ) control peptides and unstimulated samples was always performed to rule out unspecific stimulation .
Antibodies and peptides .
Fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated anti-IFN-y , phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated anti-CD69 , Peridinin-chlorophyl-protein ( PerCP ) -conjugated anti-CD8 , allophyocyanin ( APC ) -conjugated anti-CD3 , and the corresponding isotype- and fluorescent conjugate-matched control reagents were purchased from Becton Dickinson .
Peptides ( synthesized by the standard Fmoc method ) were purchased from NMI ( Reutlingen , Germany ) or produced at our own facility .
Peptides were stored freeze-dried or in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) at 4 mg/ml .
Peptide pools were generated from peptides dissolved in DMSO .
DMSO concentrations in all assay mixtures were kept below 0.1 % ( vol/vol ) .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Measurement of peptide-specific induction of IFN-y in CD8 * T cells is a rapid and efficient way to identify CD8 -T-cell epitopes ( 12 ) .
By testing 81 overlapping peptides , the complete amino acid sequence of the IE-1 protein was covered .
Peptide pools were set up in such a way that every peptide was contained in exactly two pools .
Thus , it was possible to identify candidate peptides by testing not more than 18 peptide pools on day 1 ( Fig .
1 ) .
The following day , selected candidate peptides were tested individually .
For this purpose , PBMC from the same donors had been kept in complete medium in a standard incubator overnight .

Design of peptide pools .
The numbers of the pools ( left column and top row ) are shown in bold .
Individual peptides ( # = 81 ) in these 18 pools correspond to the numbers in the respective columns and rows , with peptide 1 = IE-1 , ; , , peptide 2 = IE-1 ; ; ; , etc. , according to the complete sequence of the 72-kDa major IE protein .
previously identified pp6S5-derived peptides ( 12 ) on days 1 and 2 revealed that this preincubation slightly increased the frequency of responding CD8 T cells without increasing nonspecific stimulation as tested with an irrelevant peptide ( Fig .
1 , top right ) .
We believe that this effect was due to preactivation of antigen-presenting cells and/or a reduction of inhibitory monocytic activity .
The shading in Fig .
1 illustrates how candidate peptides were chosen .
The combination of the two positive pools , 7 and 15 , clearly identifies the candidate peptide 52 ( i.e. , IE-13,7-37 , , the only one contained in both pools ) .
Figure 2 corresponds to Fig .
1 and shows the CD8 *-T-cell IFN-y responses obtained with six different pools , the two positive pools and the four `` neighboring '' negative pools , 6 , 8 , 14 , and 16 .
Table 1 summarizes the results from 15 experiments with samples from healthy HCMV IgG-seropositive donors , which led to the identification of several CD8 * -T -cell-inducing IE-1-derived peptides .
Table 1 also shows the results obtained by testing a corresponding set of 15-amino-acid peptides covering the complete sequence of the pp65 protein ( SwissProt accession no .

Among the IE-1-derived peptides , IE-1 ; ; , ; ; ; , ( EFCRVLC CYVLEETS ) , IE-1 ; 93 2p ; ( ARAKKDELRRKMMYM ) , and IE-11s99 713 ( ELRRKMMYMCYRNIE ) were the most frequently identified .
All donors reactive to IE-1 ; , , ; ; , were HLA-B7 , HLA-Bw6 , and HLA-Cw7 positive ( D1 , D2 , D3 , and D4 ) ; however , donors who were HLA-Cw ? 7 or HLA-Bw6 but not HLA-B7 positive did not react to this peptide ( for example D5 , D6 , D9 , D10 , and D11 ) , identifying HLA-B7 as the presenting allomorph .
To define the epitope contained in IE-1 ; , ,_ , , , more pre-cisely , all seven consecutive 9-amino-acid peptides derived from its sequence were synthesized ( i.e. , IE-l39 415 IE-1309-317 , through IE-1 ; ; ; ; ; , ) and tested in two donors .
Several of these nonamer peptides were able to stimulate IFN-y induction .
In both donors , ; ; ; induced the highest frequency of CD8¢* T cells ( 0.84 and 0.64 % ) , IE-l310 31s gave a somewhat smaller response ( 0.50 and 0.42 % ) , and two additional consecutive peptides , IE-1399 317 and 31g , gave increasingly weak responses ( Fig .
3 ) .
These different frequencies of responding CD8 * T cells obtained in response to stimulation with largely overlapping peptides suggested that T cells of overlapping or different speci- voL .

ficities were addressed or that , owing to the relatively high concentrations of peptides we used ( on the order of 10° mol/ liter ) , the incomplete epitope also stimulated T-cell cytokine induction in much the same way as incomplete epitopes can induce target cell lysis in CTL assays if their concentrations are high enough ( 7 ) .
This will have to be examined in additional experiments .
Finally , to show that previous infection with CMV was necessary for cytokine induction by IE-1 ; , , , ; ; , , we tested this peptide on PBMC from three HCMV-seronegative , HLA-B7-positive donors under identical conditions but observed no response ( Table 1 , bottom ) .
Phorbol myristate acetate/iono-mycin stimulation performed in parallel showed that the CD8 * T cells from all individuals were able to produce cytokines upon stimulation .
We assumed , therefore , that reactivity to this peptide in our HLA-B7-positive donors was indeed dependent on immunization with HCMV and not likely to result from cross-reactivity with peptides of different origin .
Unlike IE-13 , ; 37 , , the other identified epitopes did not allow for easy determination of their presenting HLA molecule .
Notably , the peptides IE-1 ; 93 397 and IE-1199 313 ( Table 1 ) share 9 amino acids , suggesting that in donors who were reactive to both peptides ( DS and D11 [ Table 1 ] ) this overlap may define the epitope .
Interestingly , computerized binding motif analysis carried out by SYFPEITHI ( 16 ) , a computer program based on listings of MHC ligands and binding motifs ( 17 , 18 ) predicted HLA-B8 as the most likely presenting allomorph for this candidate epitope .
An even higher score , however , was obtained for HLA-Al and the decapeptide , IE-lj9g 207 ( DELRRKMMYM [ contained only in IE-1 ; 5 ; ; , ; ] ) .
Neverthe- less , at this stage the data is inconclusive , because although HLA-A1 and HLA-B8 are found in all donors reactive to one or both of these peptides ( D4 , DS , D10 , and D11 ) , other donors with just HLA-A1 ( D8 and D12 ) , just HLA-B8 ( D15 ) , or both HLA-A1 and HLA-B8 ( D6 ) did not respond to either .
Fine mapping of the epitope ( s ) with smaller peptides , however , is likely to give additional clues .
It is important to note that despite the identification of many new epitopes and high frequencies of CD8* T cells directed against them in some donors , samples from other individuals tested with the complete set of IE-1 peptides showed no response to any of them .
Testing some of our donors with a corresponding set of overlapping peptides covering the complete 561-amino-acid sequence of pp65 identified several individuals who , despite a strong response to one or several IE-1-derived peptides , did not respond to any of the pp6S5-derived peptides and vice versa .
By testing the pp65-derived peptides , several new epitopes were identified , and some of these are also shown in Table 1 ( the presenting HLA allomorphs are currently being determined ) .
In some donors , the responses to certain peptides were clearly positive ( a distinct population of IFN-y-positive events not observed in the control ) yet extremely small .
For example , in D15 , the frequency of CD8 * T cells responsive to pp654ge_sq3 and pp65493_sqp7 ( both containing the known epitope sq3 ) was only 0.02 % , while 0.78 % responded to the newly identified epitope pPP65zGs 210 This probably illustrates that when several different epitopes can be presented , individual peptides may become dominant epitopes .
The same phenomenon may also be observed in 8182 KERN ET AL .

In donors reactive to both pp65 and IE-1 , the frequencies of responsive CD8 * T cells may be compared ; however , it should be noted that the responses obtained with overlapping peptides can not simply be added , since complete or partial epitopes may be contained in the overlap .
More important than the difference in the frequencies of CD8 * T cells respond ing to one or the other protein in donors responsive to both seems to be the fact that some donors responded to only one of the two proteins .

Fine mapping of a 15-amino-acid peptide .
According to the amino acid sequence of the HLA-B7-presented peptide 3 ; , ( EFCRVLCCYVLEETS ) , seven additional nonamer peptides were synthesized and tested on PBMC of an HLA-B7-positive donor whose CD8 * T cells were reactive to the original peptide ( top ) .
Several of these nonamer peptides led to IFN-y induction in CD8 * T cells , with IE-1sp , 317 giving the strongest response ( middle and bottom ) .
IFN-y-positive events are highlighted .
The activation marker CD69 is used to increase the specificity of the analysis .
Results for 50,000 CD8 * T cells are displayed .
PBMC were stained with anti-IFN-y-FITC , anti-CD69-PE , anti-CD8-PerCP , and anti-CD3-APC .
Axes show log fluorescence intensity .
CD8 * T cells exist in some but not all individuals may be very important with regard to IE-l-associated immune system pathology ( 3 , 4 ) .
IE-1 is known to induce adhesion molecule upregulation in infected cells , which may lead to nonspecific activation of other cells ( 3 , 4 ) .
This process is not disrupted by therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet ( 4 ) .
The role of IE-1-recognizing CD8 * T cells in such a situation will be an interesting subject to study .
Notably , all donors nonresponsive to the pp65 peptides were HLA-A2 or HLA-B7 negative .
Conversely , most individuals not responding to IE-1 were HLA-A2 positive and HLA-B7 negative .
The data , though preliminary , suggests that preferences for IE-1 over pp65 and vice versa are directly related to the HLA type , and additional studies are in progress to corroborate these results .
Dominant peptides may be derived from pp65 or IE-1 , and clearly there is no obvious hierarchy of presenting allomorphs at this stage .
Interestingly , Gilbert et al .
reported in 1996 that IE-1-specific CTL were able to lyse IE-1-transfected but not HCMV-infected autologous fibroblasts ( 10 ) , and they found that pp65 apparently abrogated IE-1 peptide presentation by restricting its access to the antigen-processing machinery or diverting it to a different degradation pathway .
This in contrast to earlier data obtained by Borysiewicz et al. , who found that in two subjects , 18 to 58 % of the CTL clones able to lyse HCMV -infected autologous fibroblasts were IE-1 specific ( 2 ) .
In their study , only a small number of IE-1-specific CTL clones were unable to lyse HCMV -infected targets .
The phenomenon described by Gilbert et al .
may thus apply to only some IE-1-specific clones .
This could be explained if some but not all IE-1 epitopes escaped presentation under the influence of pp65 .
Neverthe-less , the high frequencies of IE-1-specific CD8 * T cells in our donors clearly argue that sufficient presentation of IE-1-derived peptides takes place for these cells to be generated .
It is important to note in this regard that in HCMV reactivation , IE proteins are expressed prior to the early protein pp65 ( whose expression is regulated by IE-1- and IE-2-dependent promot-ers ) ( 22 ) .
Recent studies indicate that HCMV reactivation is a frequent event even in healthy donors ( 23 ) , seems to be stress related , and is probably mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) ( 6 , 23 ) .
To compile a selection of epitopes which may be useful for immunotherapy in a majority of the population , additional work must be done .
Since the protein-coding content of HCMV is enormous , it will hardly be possible to scan all proteins for epitopes .
However , the need to identify T-cell targets in HCMV proteins will increase if vaccination trials using , for example , the AZ-presented are Success 8184 KERN ET AL .
ful ( 5 ) .
Our results should encourage the search for T-cell epitopes in other nonstructural HCMV proteins to complete the repertoire of peptides which may be potential candidates for vaccine development .
