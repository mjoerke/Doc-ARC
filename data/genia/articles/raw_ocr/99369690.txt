PHAGOCYTES C/EBPB and GATA-1 Synergistically Regulate Activity of the Eosinophil Granule Major Basic Protein Promoter : Implication for C/EBPB Activity in Eosinophil Gene Expression By Yuji Yamaguchi , Hitoshi Nishio , Kenji Kishi , Steven J. Ackerman , and Toshio Suda Eosinophil granule major basic protein ( MBP ) is expressed exclusively in eosinophils and basophils in hematopoietic cells .
In our previous study , we demonstrated a major positive regulatory role for GATA-1 and a negative regulatory role for GATA-2 in MBP gene transcription .
Further analysis of the MBP promoter region identified a C/EBP ( CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein ) consensus binding site 6 bp upstream of the functional GATA-binding site in the M BP gene .
In the cell line HT93A , which is capable of differentiating towards both the eosinophil and neutrophil lineages in response to retinoic acid ( RA ) , C/ EBP « mRNA expression decreased significantly concomitant with eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation , w hereas C/ EBPB expression w as markedly increased .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) showed that recombinant C/EBPB protein could bind to the potential C/ EBP-binding site ( bp -90 to -82 ) in the MBP promoter .
Furthermore , we have demonstrated that both C/EBPB and GATA-1 can bind simultaneously to the C/ EBP- and GATA-binding sites in the MBP promoter .
To IFFERENTIATION OF eosinophils from myeloid progeni- tors is regulated by several different cytokines , including interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , and IL-5 . ' ''
Of these cytokines , IL-5 is eosinophil-lineage specific and plays a principal role in the terminal differentiation of eosinophils and development of eosinophilia . ''
However , the molecular basis for the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to the eosinophil lineage remains to be elucidated .
We have been characterizing the regulatory regions of genes encoding eosinophil-specific proteins , including eosinophil peroxidase ( EPO ) , '' Charcot-Leyden crystal ( CLC ) protein , '' and eosinophil major basic protein ( MBP ) , '' to identify transcription factors involved in regulating the commitment and terminal differentiation of myeloid progenitors to the eosinophil lineage .
In analyses of the MBP promoter region , we have identified a major positive regulatory role for GATA-1 and a negative regulatory role for GATA-2 in MBP gene transcription , providing the first evidence for a GATA-regulated gene in the eosinophil lineage . ''
Further analysis of the MBP promoter region identified a C/EBP ( CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ) consensus binding site 6 bp upstream of the functional GATA-binding site in a positively acting region of the MBP promoter . ''
The C/EBP family belongs to the larger family of basic leucine zipper ( bZip ) transcription factors .
To date , 6 members have been cloned and characterized , including C/EBPa , '' ' '' '' C/EBPB , '* ! 5 C/EBPy , ! ° C/EBP3 , ' '' ° C/EBPe,22 and CHOP . ''
C/EBP proteins have been shown to regulate a number of hepatic'**+2*25 and genes .
Expression of C/EBP proteins in the hematopoietic system , particularly C/EBPa « , C/EBPB , and C/EBPe , is limited to myeloid cells , suggesting that they play an important role in the differentiation of myeloid cells.2 > '' > ? % '' '' Recent studies from other laboratories have shown that PU.1 ( Spi-1 ) and the C/EBP family , in particular C/EBPa , may serve as master regulators of Blood , Vol 94 , No 4 ( August 15 ) , 1999 ; pp 1429-1439 determine the functionality of both the C/EBP- and GATA-binding sites , we analyzed whether C/ EBPB and GATA-1 can stimulate the MBP promoter in the C/EBPRB and GATA-1 negative Jurkat T-cell line .
Cotransfection with C/ EBPB and GATA-1 expression vectors produced a 5-fold increase compared with cotransfection with the C/ EBPB or GATA-1 expression vectors individually .
In addition , GST pull-down experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between human GATA-1 and C/EBPB .
Expression of FOG ( Friend of GATA ) , which binds to GATA-1 and acts as a cofactor for GATA-binding proteins , decreased transactivation activity of GATA-1 for the MBP promoter in a dose-dependent manner .
Our results provide the first evidence that both GATA-1 and C/EBPB synergistically transactivate the promoter of an eosinophil-specific granule protein gene and that FOG may act as a negative cofactor for the eosinophil lineage , unlike its positively regulatory function for the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages .

Differences in the role of GATA-1 in eosinophil versus erythroid/megakaryocyte development and gene expression remain to be elucidated .
We report here that C/EBPB can physically interact with GATA-1 and synergistically transactivate the MBP P2 promoter with GATA-1 .

RESULTS Identification of a C/EBP consensus site in the functional promoter region of the MBP gene .
There are 2 promoters , Pl and P2 , in the MBP gene .
The distal promoter , which exists 5 ' upstream to exon 1 and drives expression of the 1.6-kb transcript , and the proximal promoter , which exists 5 ' upstream to exon 9 and drives expression of the 1.0-kb transcript , have been designated the P1 and P2 promoters , respectively . ''
We previously reported the specificity of P2 promoter for the eosinophil lineage and identified a positively acting region in the bp -117 to -67 segment of the MBP P2 gene . ''
In addition , we showed that GATA-1 could bind to a GATA consensus site , bp -76 to -71 , in this region and could transactivate the MBP P2 promoter . ''
As shown in Fig 1 , we have identified a C/EBP consensus binding site at bp -90 to -82 , 6 bp upstream of the functional GATA-binding site in this promoter .
Induction of C/EBPB mRNA expression in a cell line capable of differentiating towards both the eosinophil and neutrophil lineages .
- We have established a cell line capable of differentiating towards the eosinophil and neutrophil lineages in response to RA , HT93A.45 As shown by Northern blot analysis ( Fig 2 ) , no mRNA expression for MBP , gp91 '' '' '' * , and neutrophil elas-tase , which are markers for eosinophil and neutrophil lineages , GATA-1 , or PU.1 ( Spi-1 ) , was observed in untreated HT93A cells ( Fig 2 , lane 1 ) .
This result shows that the uninduced HT93A cell line does not express genes characteristic of the eosinophil and neutrophil lineages .
For the GATA-binding proteins , GATA-1 expression was induced 3 days after induction of HT93A cells with RA , whereas GATA-2 was expressed constitutively before and during the eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation of the cell line , consistent with our previous studies . '' ''
In contrast , expression of GATA-3 , which plays an important role in lymphoid development , was markedly downregulated during the eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation of HT93A cells .
For the C/EBPs , expression of C/EBPa decreased somewhat after 7 days of culture with RA , whereas the expression of C/EBPB markedly increased from day 1 to 7 during differentiation towards the eosinophil and From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

SYNERGISTIC ACTION OF C/EBPB AND GATA-1 ON THE MBP neutrophil lineages .
The expression of PU.1 ( Spi-1 ) , an ETS-domain transcription factor essential for the development of myeloid and B-lymphoid cells , also increased considerably along with the eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation of HT93A cells .
These results suggest that GATA-1 , C/EBPB , and PU.1 ( Spi-1 ) play an important role in eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation .
binds to the C/EBP consensus site in the MBP P2 promoter region .
Northern blot analysis in HT93A cells treated with RA indicated that C/EBPB was induced during the eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation .
Miiller et al '' '' have reported that NF-M , the chicken homolog of C/EBPR , induces eosinophil differentiation in a multipotent progenitor cell line transformed by the Myb-Ets oncoprotein .
Furthermore , we have recently shown that MBP promoter activity is increased 10-fold by cotransfecting the plasmids expressing C/EBPa or C/EBP3 , whereas cotransfection with the C/EBPB expression vector produced a 20-fold increase . ''
From the above-noted findings , it was suggested that C/EBPB might be involved in the regulation of MBP gene expression .
Accordingly , to determine whether C/EBPB binds to the potential C/EBP-binding site , bp -90 to -82 , in the MBP P2 promoter region , EMSAs were performed ( Fig 3 ) .
The gel-shift analysis was performed using a purified recombinant C/EBPR protein , maltose-binding protein ( MBP ) -C/EBPB , and nuclear extracts from COS7 cells transiently transfected with the GATA-1 expression vector , as described previously . ''
Full-length murine C/EBPB fused to the maltose-binding protein ( MBP ) was expressed in E coli and then purified by amylose resin affinity chromatography . '' ''
A DNA probe spanning bp -93 to -58 of the MBP promoter formed a specific protein-DNA complex when incubated with MBP-C/ EBPB ( Fig 3 , lane 2 ) , but not with maltose-binding protein alone ( Fig 3 , lane 1 ) .
The complex formed with the specific probe was inhibited by an excess amount of the wild-type ( competitor DNA A ) and GATA site-mutated ( competitor DNA B ) oligonucleotides ( Fig 3 , lanes 3 and 4 ) but not by an oligonucleotide mutated in only the C/EBP consensus site ( competitor DNA C ) or an oligonucleotide mutated in both sites ( competitor DNA D ; Fig 3 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
An EMSA with nuclear extracts from COS7 cells transfected with a GATA-1 expression vector and oligonucleotide spanning the MBP promoter from position bp -93 to -58 showed the formation of a specific GATA-1 complex ( Fig 3 , lane 7 ) .
Incubation of both GATA-1 and C/EBPB proteins with the labeled probe showed 3 specific complexes , GATA-1 alone , C/EBPR alone , and combined GATA-1 and C/EBPLB ( Fig 3 , lane 8 ) .
The C/EBPB-DNA complex band was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides A and B ( Fig 3 , lanes 9 and 10 ) , but not by unlabeled oligonucleotides C and D containing a mutated C/EBP site ( Fig 3 , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
The GATA-1-DNA complex band was also competed by oligonucleotides A and C ( Fig 3 , lanes 9 and 11 ) , but not by oligonucleotides B and D ( Fig 3 , lanes 10 and 12 ) .
To confirm the results shown in Fig 3 , we performed the EMSA with various labeled oligonucleotide probes ( Fig 4 ) .
When incubated with labeled wild-type oligonucleotide ( probe A ) and MBP-C/ EBPB or GATA-1 protein , the probe spanning position bp -93 to -58 ( probe A ) yielded 1 DNA-protein complex with C/EBPB or GATA-1 protein ( Fig 4 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Incubation of both C/EBPB and GATA-1 proteins with the wild-type probe 1433 ( probe A ) formed 3 specific bands , GATA-1 , C/EBPB , and GATA-1/CEBPB complexes ( Fig 4 , lane 4 ) .
In contrast , incubation of both proteins with the GATA-site mutated probe ( probe B ) or C/EBP mutated probe ( probe C ) did not yield the 3 complexes ( Fig 4 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Also , the incubation of both proteins with C/EBP and GATA site-mutated probes formed no DNA-protein complex ( Fig 4 , lane 7 ) .
These results demonstrate that C/EBPB binds to the C/EBP consensus site , bp -90 to -82 , and that both C/EBPB and GATA-1 can bind to the C/EBP- and GATA-binding sites simultaneously .
C/EBP transactivates the MBP promoter synergistically with GATA-1 .
- Our gel-shift analysis showed that C/EBPB can bind to the C/EBP consensus site of the MBP promoter .
Accordingly , to determine whether the C/EBP-binding site is functional , we analyzed the ability of C/EBPB and GATA-1 either individually or in combination to transactivate the MBP promoter in the C/EBPRB and GATA-1 negative Jurkat cell line .
Cotransfection with the GATA-1 or C/EBPRB expression vector produced a 5-fold increase in MBP promoter activity ( Fig 5 ) .
When both C/EBPB and GATA-1 expression vectors were transfected together , there was a S5-fold increase in MBP promoter activity above that obtained with these vectors individually ( Fig 5 ) .
To obtain more detailed information on the relative function of the GATA- versus C/EBP-binding sites , we constructed mutant reporter plasmids in which the GATA-and/or the C/EBP-binding sites were disrupted by multiple nucleotide sequence substitutions ( Fig 6A and B ) .

The T-lymphocytic Jurkat cell line was transfected by the electroporation method with 5 ug of the MBP promoter construct ( bp -117/pXP2-MBP ) along with the following expression constructs : pXP2-MBP + pEF-BOS , pXP2-MBP ( control ) and 4 pg of pEF-BOS ( the control plasmid containing the elongation factor promoter without cDNAs ) ; pXP2-MBP + pEF-GATA1 , 2 pg of pEF-GATA-1 , and 2 ug of pEF-BOS ; pXP2-MBP + pEF-C/EBPB ; 2 ug of pEF-C/EBPB and 2 pg of pEF-BOS , pXP2-MBP + pEF-GATA-A1 + pEF-C/EBPB ; and 2 pg of pEF-GATA-1 and 2 pg of pEF-C/EBPR .
Luciferase activity was measured 24 hours after transfection and normalized for transfection efficiency based on the activity of a cotransfected B-galactosidase expression vector ( CMV-BGal ) .
Data are show n as the mean of 3 independent experiments ( +SEM } ) .

Mutations ofthe GATA-or C/EBP-binding sites diminish MBP promoter activity ( A ) and mutations of the GATA- or C/EBP-sites does not prevent synergy ( B ) .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with pXP2-MBP containing wild-type GATA-1 and C/ EBP-sites , pXP2-MBP containing a mutated GATA-binding site , and/or pXP2-MBP containing a mutated C/EBP-binding site , along with 2 pg of pEF-GATA-1 and/or pEF-C/EBPB expression vectors .
The error bar represents the SEM for 3 independent ex 0 Fig 6A , the constructs with the mutated C/EBP- and/or GATA-binding sites decreased the promoter activity compared with those shown in the wild-type construct .
When GATA-1 and C/EBPB expression vectors were added together with a wild-type construct , there was a 60-fold induction of MBP promoter activity ( Fig 6B ) .
When C/EBPB or GATA-1 expression vector was added individually with constructs containing mutated GATA- or C/EBP-binding sites , a 4-fold induction of MBP promoter activity could be detected , confirming a synergistic effect of GATA-1 and C/EBPB for MBP promoter activity ( Fig 6B ) .
On the other hand , when both factors , GATA-1 and C/EBPB , were used together with the constructs containing mutated GATA- or C/EBP-binding sites , MBP promoter activity was induced by 30-fold or 50-fold , respectively ( Fig 6B ) .
When GATA-1 and C/EBPB expression vectors were added simultaneously together with the construct containing mutations in both the GATA- and C/EBP-binding sites , the promoter activity Relative Promoter Activity ( Fold above wild -type MBP construct ) 20 40 610 80 periments .
Luciferase activity was normalized to B-galactosidase activity from a cotransfected CMV-BGal plasmid .
was the same as that obtained with these vectors individually for the construct of both sites ' mutants ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that GATA-1 and C/EBPB may interact physically .
However , the mechanisms by which C/EBPB synergistically transactivates the MBP promoter in association with GATA-1 remain to be determined .
Physical interaction between GATA-1 and C/EBPGB .
Because the data in Fig 6B suggested that GATA-1 may be able to bind C/EBPB through protein-protein interactions , we proceeded to test this possibility directly in vitro .
`` S-labeled C/EBPB produced by translation in vitro was allowed to bind to hGATA-1 fused to GST or GST alone and was immobilized onto a glutathione-Sepharose matrix , after which the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
GATA-1 associated clearly with C/EBP $ in vitro , and as much as 15 % of the input protein was recovered as complexes with GATA-1 ( Fig 7 ) .
However , C/EBPB did not adhere to GST resin devoid of From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

- Physical interaction between C/ EBPB and GATA-1 in vitro .
`` S-labeled full-length C/ EBPB was synthesized by translation in vitro and incubated with GST alone ( lane 2 ) or GST-hGATA-1 ( lane 3 ) adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose , after which the matrix was washed and bound proteins were analyzed as described in Materials and Methods .
Lane 1 represents 15 % of the amount of labeled protein incubated with matrices .
GATA-1 .
Thus , there is a physical interaction between GATA-1 and C/EBPB .
FOG decreases the ability of GATA-1 to transactivate the MBP promoter The GATA-1 protein has 2 zinc fingers , a carboxyl-terminal zinc finger ( C-f ) and an amino-terminal zinc finger ( N-f ) .
The C-f of GATA-1 provides the essential DNA binding domain necessary for GATA-1 binding to GATA motifs , whereas the N-f of GATA-1 is not necessary for DNA binding .
Recently , Tsang et al '' '' identified a novel , multitype zinc finger protein , FOG , that binds to the N-f of GATA-1 and acts as a cofactor for GATA-binding proteins .
To determine the effect of FOG on GATA-1 transactivation of the MBP promoter , we analyzed the expression of FOG mRNA in HT93A cells capable of differentiating towards eosinophil and neutrophil lineages .
As shown in Fig 8A , the transcript for FOG was rapidly downregulated during the RA-induced eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation of the HT93A cell line .
It has been shown 1435 that FOG and GATA-1 synergistically activate transcription of an erythroid- and megakaryocyte-associated p45NF-E2 gene promoter . ''
We addressed whether FOG can synergize with GATA-1 to activate transcription of the eosinophil-specific MBP P2 promoter .
A fixed amount of GATA-1 and increasing amounts of FOG were transiently coexpressed in Jurkat cells together with pXP2-MBP .
Surprisingly , expression of FOG decreased the transactivation activity of GATA-1 for the MBP P2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 8B ) .
To examine the effect of the pMT2 vector used to express FOG on GATA-1 transactivation of the MBP promoter , a constant amount ( 8 ug ) of pMT2 plus pMT2-FOG was used in the transactivation study .
As shown in Fig 8C , a pMT2 vector did not affect the negative regulatory role of FOG for GATA-1 transactivation of the MBP promoter .
In addition , to analyze the specificity of the inhibitory effect of FOG on GATA-1 transactivation of the MBP promoter , a fixed amount of FOG-unrelated expression vector , pEP-C/ EBPB , and increasing amounts of FOG expression vectors were coexpressed in Jurkat cells together with the construct containing mutated GATA-binding site .
As shown in Fig 8D , expression of FOG did not affect the transactivation activity of C/EBPB for the MBP P2 promoter , indicating the specificity of the inhibitory effect of FOG for GATA-1-dependent transactivation of the MBP promoter .
These results suggest an inhibitory role of FOG for GATA-l-regulated genes in the eosinophil lineage , unlike that of FOG activity in the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages .
DISCUSSION We previously reported that GATA-1 can independently transactivate the MBP P2 promoter , but that GATA-2 has the capacity to compete for GATA-1 binding and to inhibit GATA-1 transactivation . ''
Furthermore , we have also shown that C/EBP family members , in particular C/EBP « , C/EBPB , and C/EBP38 , are able to transactivate the MBP promoter individually . ''
In the present study , we have shown that C/EBPRB can bind to the C/EBP consensus site ( bp -90 to -82 ) of the MBP P2 promoter and can transactivate MBP promoter activity synergistically with GATA-1 .
In the hematopoietic system , C/EBPa , -B , and -e play an important role in myeloid differentiation .
Scott et al '' '' have reported that the expression of C/EBPa predominates in immature myelomonocytic cells and that C/EBPRB expression predominates in terminally differentiated cells , consistent with our Northern blot analysis of RA-induced HT93A cells .
C/EBPa is crucial to the activity of the G-CSFR promoter , '' '' and C/EBPa knock out ( KO ) mice have impaired G-CSFR expression and signaling through this lineage-specific cytokine receptor . ''
Expression of C/EBPB was found to parallel the differentiation of myeloid cells to macrophages , and C/EBPB KO mice display impaired macrophage function . '' ''
Recently , Chih et al '' have shown that C/EBPe shows a restricted pattern of expression in cells of the myeloid lineage during their differentiation toward granulocytes .
In particular , they suggest that C/EBPe plays an important role in the differentiation of granulocytic progenitors to myeloblasts/promyelocytes . '' ''
In this study , we have not analyzed the effect of C/EBPe on eosinophilic differentiation , but C/EBPe null mice have been shown to have impaired eosinophil development . '' ''
Further studies on the role of C/EBP in the eosinophilic differentiation are required .

Additionally , granulocyte-expression increased along with the eosinophilic and neutro- committed cells express little C/EBPa compared with C/EBPB , From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

SYNERGISTIC ACTION OF C/EBPB AND GATA-1 ON THE MBP whereas in more primitive myeloid progenitors , only C/EBPa is present . '' ''
These findings suggest that C/EBPB plays a more important role in the terminal differentiation of the eosinophil lineage than C/EBPa .
Cell-type specific gene expression often involves interaction with different transcription factors .
In particular , C/EBP family members can form homodimers or heterodimers with each other and also interact with other transcription factors such as the myb oncogene .
`` ° Attempts to demonstrate direct interactions between two transcription factors by gel-shift analysis , eg , C/EBPRB and the glucocorticoid receptor for the rat « 1-acid glycoprotein gene and C/EBP and PU.1 for the murine neutrophil elastase gene , '' have been performed without success .
Williams et al % have shown that C/EBPR contains a negative regulatory region composed of 2 elements , RD1 and RD2 .
They suggested that the inactive form of C/EBPR adopts a tightly folded conformation that masks the activation and DNA-binding domains located at the N-and C-termini , respectively , and that activation of C/EBPRB requires some event , which causes the protein to unfold and unmask the activation and DNA-binding domains .
Transcription factors activate promoter activity by interacting with the basal transcriptional machinery .
The CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) has been suggested to bridge c-Myb and NF-M , the chicken homolog of C/EBP .
Recently , it has been reported that CBP acts as a coactivator of GATA-1 . ''
These observations suggest that CBP functions as a bridging protein between C/EBP , GATA-1 , and the basal transcriptional complex in the MBP promoter .
It has been reported that FOG acts as a cofactor for GATA-binding proteins and that FOG and GATA-1 synergize in activating transcription of the erythroid/ megakaryocytic-expressed p45 NF-E2 gene . '' ''
However , in our study , FOG acted as a negative cofactor for transcription of the eosinophil-specific MBP P2 promoter .
FOG is expressed in both erythroblasts and megakaryocytes , but not in mast cells . '' ''
In our experiment , the expression of FOG mRNA was downregulated during the RA-induced eosinophilic and neutrophilic differentiation of the HT93A cells .
These findings suggest that FOG acts as a negative regulator for the eosinophil , neutrophil , or mast cell lineages , in contrast to its positive regulatory function for the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
One of the mechanisms by which FOG decreases the transactivation activity of GATA-1 for the MBP P2 promoter may be to block the interaction between GATA-1 and the basal transcriptional complex in the MBP gene .
To date , it has been reported that C/EBPB has the capacity to act synergistically to transactivate promoters with a number of other factors , including NF-kB , '' c-Jun , glucocorticoid receptor , '' and v-Myb . '' ''
In the present study , physical interaction between GATA-1 and C/EBPB was demonstrated by a GST pull-down assay .
It has been reported that C/EBPR can bind to the c-fos serum response element binding protein ( SRE BP ) , '' glucocorticoid receptor , '' and AML1 .
`` ° However , to date , there are no reports of a physical interaction between GATA-1 and C/EBPB .
Our report is the first to describe both a physical interaction and cooperativity between GATA-1 and C/EBPB .
However , these data are not definitive .
We have to perform the coimmunoprecipitation experiment using extracts from eosinophilic cell lines for demonstrating that endogenous GATA-1 and C/EBPB interact in vivo .
The extent of the 1437 enhancement of C/EBPB-GATA-1-mediated transcription for the eosinophil-specific MBP P2 promoter by cotransfected CBP was less than that of GATA-1-dependent transcription for the erythroid-specific EKLF promoter by cotransfected CBP ( data not shown ) .
The role of FOG and CBP in the eosinophil lineage may be different from that in the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineages , with the difference in commitment towards eosinophilic versus erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation due to the differential functions of these cofactors .
It has been shown that GATA-1 and PU.1 , an ets transcription factor , stimulate activity of the IL-4 intronic enhancer '' ® and that both GATA-1 and the ets family transcription factors increase promoter activity of the c-mpl ( the thrombopoietin receptor ) gene . ''
In addition , it was reported that GATA-1 could convert myeloid cells in part to eosinophils in Myb-Ets-transformed chicken myeloblasts .
`` 2 Recently , McNagny et al '' '' have reported that low levels of GATA-1 stimulated the eosinophil-specific EOS47 promoter moderately in the presence of Ets-1 , c-Myb , and C/EBPa in the chicken hematopoietic system .
Also , Nerlov et al '' have shown that chicken C/EBPa and C/EBPB can induce both myeloid and eosinophil lineage commitment .
However , as far as we know , it has not been previously reported that the GATA-1 and C/EBP transcription factors have the capacity to act coordinately or interactively to stimulate promoter activity in a synergistic fashion .
Our results provide the first evidence that GATA-1 and C/EBPB have the capacity to act synergistically to affect the transcriptional activity of an eosinophil-specific granule protein gene .
