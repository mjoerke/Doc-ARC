Erikson , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , April 25 , 1995 ( received for review January 5 , 1995 ) ABSTRACT One of the most important cytokines involved in immune response regulation is interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , a potent activator of the proliferation and function of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells .
The mechanisms by which the effects of IL-2 are propagated within cells are not understood .
While the binding of IL-2 to its receptor was recently shown to lead to the activation of two kinases , Jak-1 and Jak-3 , subsequent steps in the signaling pathway to the nucleus that lead to the activation of specific genes had not been characterized .
Since many cytokines that activate Jak kinases also lead to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of members of the Stat family of transcription factors , the ability of IL-2 to trigger Stat phosphorylation was examined .
Exposure of activated human T lymphocytes or of a natural killer cell line ( NKL ) to IL-2 leads to the phosphorylation of Statla , StatlB , and Stat3 , as well as of two Stat-related proteins , p94 and p95 .
p94 and p95 share homology with Stat1 at the phosphorylation site and in the Sre homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain , but otherwise are immunologically distinct from Stat1l .
These Stat proteins were found to translocate to the nucleus and to bind to a specific DNA sequence .
These findings suggest a mechanism by which IL-2 binding to its receptor may activate specific genes involved in immune cell function .
The human immune system combines elements of both an antigen-restricted response by T and B lymphocytes and a less restricted response by natural killer ( NK ) cells .
A combination of specific antigen recognition and a general growth signal is necessary for the activation of lymphocytes .
The regulation of NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity is less well understood but depends , in part , on the presence of certain cytokines .
One of the most important growth and activation signaling molecules in both of these systems is interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , a 15-kDa glycoprotein originally identified as a T-cell growth factor ( 1 ) which binds to a tripartite receptor ( 2 ) .
Whereas the a chain of the IL-2 receptor is necessary only for high affinity binding of the ligand , the B and y chains appear to be involved in transmitting the signals necessary for IL-2-dependent cellular responses ( 3 , 4 ) .
It is not known how the binding of IL-2 to its receptor leads to lymphocyte proliferation .
The IL-2 receptor can associate with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 5 ) , and can lead to increased phosphorylation of inositides .
By a mechanism that is not yet elucidated , IL-2 interaction with its receptor also leads to the activation of S6 kinase ( 6 , 7 ) , p56'* ( 8 ) , pS3/p56Y '' ( 9 ) , Ras ( 10 ) , and Raf ( 11 , 12 ) , and the transcription of a number of immediate early genes ( 13-15 ) .
It is known that the B and y subunits of the IL-2 receptor share similarity with other receptor components of the hema-topoietic receptor superfamily , many of whose members bind to and activate Jak kinases ( 16 ) .
Recently it has been shown The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
7779 that Jak-3 and Jak-1 are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and show enhanced kinase activity in vitro in response to IL-2 ( 17-19 ) .
Activation of the Jak kinases is often accompanied by the phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of a group of cytoplasmic proteins termed Stats .
These proteins were initially identified by virtue of their role in signaling in response to interferon ( IFN ) ( 20 , 21 ) .
Statl is produced as two isoforms , a 91-kDa form ( Statla « ) and an 84-kDa form that lacks the last 38 amino acids ( Stat1 $ ) ( 22 ) .
Although both of these proteins can bind to a common DNA element , only Statla can activate transcription ( 23 ) .
Upon treatment with IFN- « , both of these proteins , as well as a distantly related 113-kDa protein ( Stat2 ) , become tyrosine phosphorylated , translocate to the nucleus , and form a complex that can bind a distinct DNA sequence and activate transcription ( 20 ) .
More recently , new members of this family have been described , including Stat3 ( 24 , 25 ) , Stat4 ( 25 , 26 ) , Stat5 ( 27 ) , and Stat6 ( 28 ) .
It is likely that there are other members of this family whose expression may be tissue re-stricted .
In general , the Stat proteins are located in the cytoplasm prior to stimulation .
Addition of the appropriate extracellular stimulus leads to Stat protein phosphorylation on tyrosine , translocation to the nucleus , binding to specific DNA sequences , and the modulation of transcription .
The present study demonstrates that both Stat proteins and Stat-related proteins are activated in response to IL-2 treatment of T lymphocytes or NK cells .
These findings delineate an IL-2-signaling pathway from the receptor to the nucleus .

RESULTS Anti-Phospho-Stat1 Antibody .
The phosphorylation of Stat1l on a single residue , Tyr-701 , is critical for its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation ( 23 ) .
To examine the phosphorylation of Statl in more detail , we raised antibodies that specifically recognized only the phosphorylated form of this protein .
This approach held the possibility of allowing greater sensitivity in detecting Stat1l phosphorylation , of visualizing activation of Statl at the cellular level by immunocytochemistry , and of identifying members of the Stat family that shared the phosphorylation site of Statl .
We immunized rabbits with a peptide containing amino acids 694-705 of mouse Stat1 with phosphotyrosine in position 701 .
The activity of this serum was tested in several ways .
Initially we examined IFN-treated cells in which the pattern of Stat formation has been determined .
When cells are treated with IFN-a , Stat1a , Stat1B , and Stat2 become phosphorylated ( 20 ) .
Western blot analysis of human melanoma cells ( SK-MEL-28 ) was performed by using antibody 91/84 , which recognizes amino acids 598-705 shared by Statle and Stat1l $ B .
This revealed two bands in untreated cells of molecular masses 91 and 84 kDa that represent Statla and Stat1 $ , respectively ( Fig .
Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 92 ( 1995 ) 1 ) .
Upon treatment with IFN-a , an additional band of apparent molecular mass 92 kDa can be seen .
This represents the Tyr-701-phosphorylated form of Stat1a ( 20 ) .
Although Stat1 B also becomes phosphorylated , the mobility of the phosphorylated form is indistinguishable from that of the unphosphor-ylated form .
To assess the specificity of the anti-phospho-Statl serum , this blot was then stripped and reprobed with the anti-phospho-Stat1 serum .
This antibody recognized no bands in untreated cells ( Fig .
1 , lane 3 ) .
By contrast , in the IFN- « ~-treated cells , it recognized bands corresponding to phosphorylated Statla « a and phosphorylated StatlB , with a 10-fold greater sensitivity than that of antibody 91/84 ( Fig .
1 , lane 4 ) .
Phosphorylated Stat2 , which does not share homology with Statl at its phosphorylation site , was not recognized by this antiserum .
That this serum is recognizing Stat1 was further shown by its ability to immunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 only from IFN-a-treated cells ( data not shown ) .
Finally , in immunocytochemistry , this antibody stained the nuclei of IFN-treated cells but showed no staining in untreated cells ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these findings indicate that the anti-phospho-Statl antiserum specifically recognizes only the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Statl .
Stats Phosphorylated in Response to IL-2 .
To explore Stat phosphorylation upon treatment with IL-2 , Western blot analysis was performed on PHA-stimulated human T cells or NKL cells treated with IL-2 by using the antibody that specifically recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Stat1 .
Within minutes of IL-2 treatment , four bands could be detected with the anti-phospho-Stat1l antiserum in activated T lymphocytes ( Fig .
24 ) .
A band of molecular mass 84 kDa that comigrates with phosphorylated Stat1B detected in IFN- « -treated cells appeared within 1 min of stimulation , reached maximal intensity at 15 min , and could no longer be detected by 60 min .
A band of molecular mass 92 kDa that comigrates with phosphorylated Stat1a appeared at near maximal intensity by 1 min and was no longer detectable by 60 min .
Two bands that were not detected in IFN-a-treated cells , of molecular masses 94 and 95 kDa were also seen .
The 94-kDa band , which is the predominant species seen in Fig .
2 , reached maximal intensity by 15 min and persisted for at least 5 h after IL-2 treatment .
By contrast , a fainter 95-kDa band did not appear until approximately 15 min after treatment with IL-2 and was barely detectable by 60 min .
The phosphorylation of the 94-kDa protein could be detected at IL-2 concentrations as low as 0.5 unit/ml ( Fig .
2B ) .
Maximal activity occurred at 10 units/ml and did not change at IL-2 concentrations as high as 1000 units/ml .
Identical results were seen in NKL cells treated with IL-2 .
To confirm that the four proteins recognized by anti-phospho-Stat1 were members of the Stat family , antibodies that recognize different Stat domains were used to immunoprecipitate Stat proteins from IL-2-stimulated cells .
Once immunoprecipitated , samples were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to assess the phosphotyrosine content of the immunoprecipitated proteins Phospho-Ab : Stati Stati Ar rales .f 91 kDa .

We considered whether Stat1l was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IL-2 treatment .
Immunoprecipitation with antibody 91C , which recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the 91-kDa Statla protein ( amino acids 713-738 ) followed by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies allowed the detection in IL-2-treated NKL cells of a band of molecular mass 92 kDa that is identical in mobility to Statla precipitated from IFN-a-treated cells ( Fig .
3 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Given this finding and the fact that the anti-phospho-Statl antibodies recognized a protein of identical mobility from IL-2-treated NKL cells by Western blotting ( Fig .
24 ) , we conclude that Stat1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IL-2 .
The magnitude of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in response to IL-2 is consistently less than that seen with stimulation by IFN-a « .
This may reflect the fact that the 94-kDa and 95-kDa proteins appear to be the principal Stats phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
We next considered whether Stat2 was phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
Immunoprecipitation with antibody 113 , which recognizes a unique segment of Stat2 , followed by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed a 113-kDa band from IFN-a-treated cells that represents Stat2 ( Fig .
3 , lane 12 ) .
Of note , Statla ( 91 kDa ) and Stat1 $ B ( 84 kDa ) were coprecipitated by antibody 113 .
By contrast , no phos-photyrosine-containing protein was immunoprecipitated by antibody 113 from IL-2-treated NKL cells ( Fig .
3 , lane 11 ) , suggesting that this protein is not phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IL-2 .
To examine the potential role of Stat3 in IL-2-induced signaling , immunoprecipitation was carried out with antibody 91N , followed by blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody .
The 91N antibody was raised to the amino terminus of Statl ( amino acids 2-66 ) , a region that is highly conserved in Stat3 ( 24 ) .
This antibody can immunoprecipitate Stat1 only weakly , but it is very effective at immuno-precipitating Stat3 ( 29 ) .
Antibody 91N precipitated an 89-kDa , tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from IL-2-treated cells that represents Stat3 ( Fig .
3 , lane 2 ) .
Although the signal in the Stat3 immunoprecipitation was weak , it was reproducible and similar in magnitude to that seen with ciliary neurotrophic 91C - giSsH2 - 113 3 ¢ ¢ Bd bu u Ab : g1N | < 3 E 1 = § | 3 € i Cytokine : _ | 3 & seee -88 kDa- t wes 1 2 8 4 5 60 7 8 9 10 11 12 Fig .

No such protein was detected in cells ( Fig .
3 , lane 3 ) .
The anti-phospho-Stat1 antiserum did not recognize phosphorylated Stat3 in Western blots following immunoprecipitation with antibody 91N in IL-2-treated cells , confirming that the anti-phospho-Stat1 antibodies do not recognize phosphorylated Stats in general ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that IL-2 treatment of NKL cells or PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl and Stat3 , but not Stat2 .
To characterize the 94- and 95-kDa proteins recognized by the anti-phospho-Stat1l antibodies , immunoprecipitation was performed by using antibody 91SH2 .
This antibody was raised against amino acids 504-596 of Stat1 , a region that resembles the Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain ( 30 ) .
The 91SH2 antibody recognizes Statl in Western blots , but it is unable to precipitate Stat1 from nondenatured cell extracts .
This antibody did not precipitate any bands from nondenatured extracts of IFN- « -treated cells ( Fig .
3 , lane 9 ) .
By contrast , antibody 91SH2 did precipitate from IL-2-treated NKL cells but not from untreated cells proteins of 94 and 95 kDa that were detected upon blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies ( Fig .
3 , lane 8 ) .
Since the 94- and 95-kDa proteins are recognized by two different antibodies that bind to distinct domains on Stat proteins ( the SH2 domain and the tyrosine phosphorylation site ) but are not recognized by certain anti-Stat1 antibodies , we conclude that these 94- and 95-kDa proteins may be members of the Stat family distinct from Stat1 that are phosphorylated in response to IL-2 in NKL cells .
Antibodies to Stat4 , -5 , and -6 were unable to immunoprecipitate any tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from IL-2-treated cells , although 'Western analysis using specific antibodies indicated that all three of these Stat proteins are present in these cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it is unlikely that p94 and p95 represent previously Uescribed Stat proteins .
It is possible that the 94- and 95-kDa bands represent differentially modified forms of the same protein .
Similar results were obtained by using extracts from activated T cells treated with IL-2 .
On Western blots with anti-phospho-Stat1 antiserum , p94 appears to be more prominent than p95 in IL-2-treated cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Following immunoprecipitation with the 91SH2 antibody and blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies , p95 often appears slightly more prominent ( Fig .
3 ) .
This may reflect a difference in the relative affinities of the anti-phospho-Stat1 antiserum and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies for the phosphorylation sites of p94 and p95 .
Alternatively , p95 may have other phosphorylated tyrosine residues in addition to that recognized by the anti-phospho-Stat1 antiserum , and this may lead to a stronger signal on the anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot .
Nuclear Translocation and DNA Binding .
Upon activation by tyrosine phosphorylation , Stat proteins may translocate to the nucleus where they can bind to specific DNA sequences .
Cellular fractionation followed by anti-phospho-Stat1 Western blotting of NKL cells treated with IL-2 revealed the presence of all of the bands identified by Western blots of whole-cell extracts in the nucleus ( Fig .
44 ) .
Immunocytochemistry with the anti-phospho-Stat1 antibody also revealed nuclear staining of NKL cells after IL-2 treatment , but not in untreated cells ( data not shown ) .

( B ) Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay .
Nuclear extracts from NKL cells that had either been untreated ( lane 1 ) or treated with IL-2 ( 50 units/ml for 10 min ; lanes 2-11 ) were incubated with *°P-labeled probe , as described in Materials and Methods .
Antibodies ( Abs ) were included in the binding reactions for samples in lane 3 ( 91C ) , lane 4 ( 91N ) , lane 5 ( anti-phospho-Stat1 ; I1P ) , lane 6 ( 91SH2 ) , lane 7 ( Stat2 ) , lane 8 ( Stat4 ) , lane 9 ( Stat5 ) , and lane 10 ( Stat6 ) .
Lane 11 contained a 50-fold excess of the unlabeled DNA probe .
phorylated Stat proteins are located in the cytoplasm in other systems , this suggests that IL-2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of Statla , Stat18 and the 94- and 95-kDa proteins .
This ability to localize in the nucleus upon tyrosine phosphorylation further supports the idea that the 94-and 95-kDa proteins are Stat family members .
To assess the ability of these Stat proteins to bind DNA , electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were performed ( Fig .
4B ) .
The probe used was a DNA sequence from the IFN-responsive factor 1 gene promoter ( AGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACGGC ) ( 31 ) that can bind homodimers of Statl « , homodimers of Stat3 , and heterodimers of Statla and Stat3 ( 29 ) .
IL-2 treatment of NKL cells led to the inducible formation of three complexes bound to this DNA element ( Fig .
4B , lanes 2 ) .
Small amounts of these complexes were detected occasionally in untreated cells ( Fig .
4B , lane 1 ) .
All of the protein-DNA complexes could be abolished by the presence of excess unlabeled DNA probe ( Fig .
4B , lane 11 ) , suggesting that they represented specific binding complexes .
We considered whether Stat1 a was a component of one of these protein-DNA complexes .
Antibodies specific for the carboxyl terminus of Stat1a disrupted complex I , suggesting that Statla is present in this complex ( Fig .
4B , lane 3 ) .
Antibodies to the amino terminus of Statl that also recognize Stat3 also abolished complex I and , in addition , led to the formation of supershifted complex A ( Fig .
4B , lane 4 ) .
This pattern of complex inhibition and supershift formation by these antibodies is identical to that seen when Statl and Stat3 are bound to the probe ( 29 ) , suggesting the participation of Stat3 in the binding to this DNA sequence .
Anti-phospho-Stat1 antibodies led to a decrease in Proc .
Natl .
Acad .

USA 92 ( 1995 ) complexes I and II and the formation of supershifted complex C ( Fig .
4B , lane 6 ) .
This suggested that one or more proteins recognized by anti-phospho-Stat1 were present in complexes I and II , although Statl itself appeared to be in complex III .
Antibodies to the SH2 domain of Stat1 led to the formation of supershifted complex B ( Fig .
4B , lane 5 ) .
This antibody does not supershift complexes from IFN-a-treated cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Stat proteins other than Stati that are recognized by this antibody are bound to the DNA probe .
Taken together , the results suggest that p94 and/or p95 are likely to be present in protein-DNA complexes I and II .
Antibodies to Stat2 , -4 , -5 , and -6 ( Fig .
4B , lanes 7-10 ) neither inhibited complex formation nor supershifted the protein-DNA complexes detected in IL-2-treated cells , suggesting that these Stat proteins were not present in the protein-DNA complexes .
We conclude that Stat1 , Stat3 , and the two Stat proteins p94 and p95 not only become phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus in response to IL-2 but that they participate in specific DNA-binding complexes , as well .
Identical findings were observed in activated human T lymphocytes stimulated with IL-2 ( data not shown ) .
Similar DNA-binding complexes could be detected with a probe containing a consensus IFN-y-activation site , although nonspecific binding to that probe was greater ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that the interaction of IL-2 with its receptor on either PHA-stimulated peripheral blood T cells or on an NK cell line leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of a set of DNA-binding proteins .
These proteins include Statla , Stat1 $ B , and Stat3 , which have been shown to be phosphorylated in response to a number of cytokines .
In addition , two other proteins of molecular masses 94 and 95 kDa are also phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
On the basis of the immunoprecipitation experiments , these proteins share antigenic similarity to Stat ] in the SH2 domain , and from the Western-blotting experiments , they share similarity to the phosphorylation site of Stat1 .
They differ from Statl , however , in their mobility on SDS/polyacrylamide gels , their precipitation by antibodies raised to the SH2 domain of Stat1 , their lack of precipitation by antibodies raised to the carboxyl terminus of Statl , and their distinct characteristics in DNA-binding assays .
Three Stat proteins have been described recently , and we considered whether p94 and p95 could be Stat4 , Stat5 , or Stat6 ( 26-28 ) .
Antibodies to Stat4 , -5 , and -6 did not immunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from IL-2-treated cells ( data not shown ) , nor did they alter the DNA binding of nuclear extracts from IL-2-treated cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
Thus , p94 and p95 may be members of the Stat family , though p94 and p95 may be differentially modified forms of the same protein .
p94 and p95 appear to be the predominant Stat proteins phosphorylated in T lymphocytes or NK cells in response to IL-2 and may have a major role in determining the genes that are activated in response to IL-2 .
Given that multiple cytokines lead to the activation of Jak kinases and the phosphorylation of Stat proteins , a key question concerns how a cytokine leads to specific responses in a particular cell .
Multiple levels of control can be envisioned .
The presence of a particular ligand-binding a chain on a cell will determine if its cognate cytokine will bind to that cell .
The presence of particular B and y subunits that can interact with a specific a chain may determine which Jak kinases are activated by cytokine binding .
The individual Jak kinase family members may have restricted specificity in terms of Stat proteins that they can phosphorylate .
For example , the phosphorylation of p94 and p95 which occurs after IL-2 treatment does not occur in response to IFN- « .
This may reflect the specificity of Jak-3 , which is not activated in response to IFN-a but is activated by IL-2 .
Alternatively , particular Stat proteins Biochemistry : Frank et al .
may only be expressed in a cell-specific manner , allowing a given cytokine to have distinct effects in different cells .
This would also generate a greater diversity of responses from the small number of Jak kinases that have been identified thus far .
There is evidence that Stat proteins bind to DNA as dimers ( 32 ) .
Thus , the specific combination of Stat proteins that become phosphorylated at a given time will likely determine the particular target genes that become activated .
Finally , cell-or tissue-specific restriction of other regulators of gene acti-vation , such as transcription factors that may function in concert with Stat proteins or the methylation of particular genes , may control cell-specific responses to a given cytokine .
It has recently been shown that the B and y subunits of the IL-2 receptor interact with Jak-1 and Jak-3 , respectively ( 33 , 34 ) .
It is also known that heterodimerization of the cytoplasmic domains of the B and y chains is necessary for IL-2 signaling ( 3 , 4 ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that IL-2 induces dimerization of the B and y subunits , leading to phosphorylation and activation of Jak-1 and Jak-3 .
The present study provides evidence for the subsequent steps of IL-2-induced signal transduction .
Five Stat proteins-Stat1a , Stat1f , Stat3 , and the Stat proteins described here , p94 and p95-are phosphorylated on tyrosine and translocate to the nucleus , where they can bind to specific DNA sequences and may lead to the transcriptional activation of genes that contain these DNA sequences within their promoter .
That each of these five proteins has distinct kinetics of phosphorylation raises the possibility that different DNA-binding complexes may form over time .
This may allow these proteins to participate in the sequential activation of genes over many hours following stimulation by IL-2 .
Studies of the c-fos protooncogene have suggested that the serum-response element can mediate IL-2-induced gene activation ( 35 ) .
The present study suggests that DNA sequences to which Stat proteins can bind also may be important for the transcriptional activation of genes in response to IL-2 .
The identification of Stat proteins activated in response to IL-2 will allow a further analysis of the physiological effects of this cytokine , including the identification of genes that are transcriptionally activated in response to IL-2 .
Such knowledge may shed light on T-cell and NK-cell activation and prolifer-ation , as well as on defects in lymphocyte signaling .
It is already known that at least one form of severe combined immunodeficiency in humans , in which there is diminished lymphocyte proliferation in response to IL-2 , is associated with a point mutation in the y subunit of the IL-2 receptor that decreases the association of this subunit with Jak-3 ( 33 ) .
Recent evidence also suggests that IL-2 , IL-4 , and IL-7 , all of which share a common y chain in their receptors and activate Jak-3 , may prevent the induction of anergy ( 36 ) .
Thus , understanding these signaling components may shed light on such processes as immunodeficiency states , immune suppression , and lym-phoid malignancies .
