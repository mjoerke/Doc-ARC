6 Transactivation of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Promoter by Human Herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) Strains GS and Z-29 in Primary Human T Lymphocytes and Identification of Transactivating HHV-6 ( GS ) Gene Fragments REBECCA T.

This study examines the regions of the HIV promoter required for HHV-6 transactivation in a heterogeneous population of primary human T lymphocytes with or without antigenic stimulation .
Two different strains of HHV-6 , GS and 229 , transactivated the HIV promoter .
The GS strain transactivated the promoter in both stimulated and resting T cells , while the Z29 strain increased HIV promoter activity only in stimulated T cells .
Three DNA clones containing HHV-6 ( GS ) genomic fragments transactivated the HIV promoter in cotransfected T cells .
A 21.4-kb DNA clone , pZVB70 , showed the highest transactivating ability , while two other DNA fragments , pZVB10 ( 6.2 kb ) and pZVH14 ( 8.7 kb ) , showed lower activity .
One of these clones , pZVH14 , activated the HIV promoter construct containing a mutation in the NFB site .
However , this mutated NFB promoter was not transactivated during HHV-6 ( GS ) infection or after cotransfection with pZVB70 or pZVB10 .
These data indicate that the NFB sites of the HIV promoter are essential for its transactivation during HHV-6 ( GS ) infection .
By increasing HIV promoter activity in primary T lymphocytes , HHV-6 may consequently increase HIV replication , leading to an increase in the cytopathic effect on coinfected human T cells .
Human CD4+ T lymphocytes are the primary target of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( 4 , 20 , 31 ) .
Infection with HIV results in the eventual development of AIDS ( 9 , 10 , 23 ) .
HIV replication can be shown in only a small percentage of T cells in vivo and seems to persist for long periods of time in a latent phase ( 2 ) .
Because the virus exists in a latent phase , infected individuals may not develop clinical manifestations of AIDS for years after the initial HIV infection ( 2 , 15 ) .
The latent HIV virus can be reactivated by various agents such as antigen , mitogen , or cytokine stimulation ( 7 , 21 ) .
A wide range of antigenic stimulation and viral infections have been demonstrated to activate the HIV promoter in various cell lines ( 13 , 22 , 40 ) .
However , it is not clear to what extent these events occur in vivo , and the mechanisms involved are not yet completely understood .
A new lymphotropic herpesvirus , human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) , has recently been isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with AIDS ( 35 , 39 ) , from patients with lymphoproliferative disorders ( 35 ) , and from infants with exanthem subitum ( 34 , 38 ) .
Immunological and molecular analyses have demonstrated that the new herpesvirus is distinct from other human herpesviruses ( 17 , 18 , 25 ) .
HHV-6 productively infects CD4+ human T cells ; however , the HHV-6 strains show variations in their ability to infect various T cells and T-cell lines ( 41 ) .
They also differ in antigenic properties ( 41 ) and exhibit DNA restriction site * Corresponding author .

2895 heterogeneity ( 5 ) .
The prototype strain , HHV-6 ( GS ) , infected a number of T-cell lines as well as human B lymphocytes , glioblastoma cells , and megakaryocytic cells ( 26 ) .
In contrast , HHV-6 ( Z29 ) , isolated from a Zairian AIDS patient , infected phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from cord blood or from adult peripheral blood but failed to replicate in unstimulated lymphocytes and certain T-cell lines ( 5 ) .
Recently , we have grown HHV-6 ( Z29 ) in the Molt-3 T-cell line , in which HHV-6 ( GS ) failed to replicate .
HHV-6 infects many of the same target cells as HIV ( 26 ) , and in vitro , HHV-6 ( GS ) can also productively coinfect HIV-infected CD4+ T cells ( 6 , 24 , 26 ) .
One study showed that this leads to accelerated cytopathic effects in comparison with HIV or HHV-6 infection alone ( 26 ) .
In addition , our previous studies have demonstrated that the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is activated in HHV-6-infected T-cell lines ( 14 ) .
Activation of the HIV LTR leads to increased HIV gene expression , which ultimately leads to a higher level of virus replication .
These observations suggest that HHV-6 can act as a cofactor in the development and possibly in the progression of AIDS .
To study the activation of HIV by HHV-6 under more physiologic conditions , we have assessed whether or not HHV-6 infection of primary human T lymphocytes can activate the HIV promoter .
Furthermore , the effects of specific antigenic stimulation in combination with infection by two strains of HHV-6 were examined .
Results of the study indicate that HHV-6 strains GS and Z29 can activate the HIV promoter in primary human T lymphocytes and differed in their dependency on antigenic stimulation for transactivation .
Transactivation by HHV-6 ( GS ) involves the NFkB region of the HIV LTR .
We have also identified three 2896 HORVAT ET AL .
different cloned HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA fragments that transactivate the HIV promoter after cotransfection into human T cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA and plasmids .
The HIV chloramphenical acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmid has been described in detail previously ( 19 ) .
Briefly , the construct contains both the 3 ' untranslated region and the repeat sequences of the HIV LTR aligned with the CAT gene .
The -147 CAT plasmid was constructed by deleting a fragment of the HIV LTR at the Aval site as described elsewhere ( 13 ) .
The -57 CAT plasmid was kindly provided by Joseph Sodroski ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , Mass . )
( 33 ) .
The HIV LTR plasmid containing the mutated NFB site was kindly provided by Gary Nabel ( 27 ) .
BamHI plasmid libraries of the HHV-6 genome were generated as described previously ( 17 ) .
HHV-6 viral strains and preparation .
The human T-cell lines HSB-2 ( ATCC CCL120.1 CCRF-HSB-2 ) and Molt-3 ( ATCC CRL 1552 ) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics .
Two strains of HHV-6 were used in this study .
HHV-6 ( GS ) was a gift from R. C. Gallo , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , Md .
; HHV-6 ( Z29 ) was a gift from P. Pellet , Centers for Disease Control , Atlanta , Ga. HHV-6 ( GS ) was grown in HSB-2 cells , and HHV-6 ( Z29 ) was grown in Molt-3 cells .
Infected cells were collected 6 to 8 days postinfection when more than 80 % of the cells were positive for viral antigens in an indirect immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) by using HHV-6 specific monoclonal antibodies ( 3 ) .
These infected cells were frozen and thawed twice , and the 50 % tissue culture infectivity dose was determined by procedures described previously ( 3 , 41 ) on HSB-2 cells for HHV-6 ( GS ) and Molt-3 cells for HHV-6 ( Z29 ) .
Human T lymphocytes .
Fresh mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of purified protein derivative ( PPD ) -immune , normal human donors by using Hy-paque-Ficoll ( 13 ) .
These cells ( 10° per well ) were then stimulated for 6 days with tuberculin PPD ( 5 pl/ml ) in 96-well round-bottom plates .
Lymphoblasts were separated from small mononuclear cells and dead cells by using a 35 to 45 % Percoll step gradient .
The cells collected at the interface between 35 and 45 % were judged to be > 98 % lymphoblasts by microscopic examination .
By immunofluorescence , 85 to 89 % of the cells were judged to be CD3+ ( Ortho T3 antibody ) .
These cells are referred to in this report as T-cell lymphoblasts and were used for transfections .
Transfection and infection of T cells .
The T-cell lymphoblasts were transfected by a DEAE-dextran method ( 1 ) .
Briefly , 1 ug of the appropriate DNA in the presence of 700 pg of DEAE-dextran per ml was added to T-cell lymphoblasts or the T-cell line HSB-2 for 3 h at 37°C .
The cells were then treated with dimethyl } sulfoxide ( 10 % ) for exactly 1 min .
After washing , the cells were placed in fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % human serum .
A portion of the transfected T cells was then infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) or HHV-6 ( Z29 ) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 by incubating the T-cell pellet for 1 h at 37°C with cell lysates of HHV-6 ( GS ) or HHV-6 ( Z29 ) .
In certain experiments , HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA clones were cotransfected with the HIV promoter constructs into primary T lymphoblasts or the T-cell line HSB-2 .
The transfected and/or infected T cells ( 2 x 10* per well ) were then added to either irradiated , adherent , autologous mononuclear cells ( 10° per well ) alone or cells that had been incubated overnight with tuberculin PPD ( 5 J. Viror .
ul/ml ) in 96-well flat-bottom plates as described earlier ( 13 ) .
These cell populations are referred to as resting transfected T cells or stimulated transfected T cells , respectively .
Five days later , the transfected T cells were collected , washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline , counted , and used in CAT assays .
Since a background level of CAT activity is observed in fresh T-cell blasts as a result of antigenic stimulation , cells were collected 5 days after transfection in order to lower this background level of CAT activity .
CAT assays .
Transfected T cells , collected after 5 days , were resuspended in 100 pl of sonication buffer ( 0.25 M Tris HCl , pH 7.4 ) .
The cell number was adjusted to 2 x 106/100 pl so that the same number of cells was used in each CAT assay .
Cellular extracts were prepared by a single freeze ( -70°C ) -thaw ( 37°C ) cycle and 1 min of sonication , followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris .
CAT assays using [ '*CJchloramphenicol and thin-layer chromatography have been described in detail previously ( 12 ) .
CAT assays using [ } Hlacetyl coenzyme A ( PHlacetyl-CoA ) have been described by Neuman et al .
( 30 ) .
Briefly , 50 pl of the cell lysates , [ PHJacetyl-CoA , and chloramphenicol was mixed in 100 mM Tris HCI , pH 8.0 .
An organic scintillation cocktail ( Econofluor ; Hewlett-Packard ) was layered over this mix-ture , and the samples were incubated at 37°C .
The samples were counted in a beta scintillation counter at hourly intervals after initiation of the assay .
Units of CAT activity in each cell lysate were calculated according to a standard curve established with a CAT sample ( Pharmacia ) of known enzymatic activity .
RESULTS HHV-6 ( GS ) transactivates the HIV LTR promoter in primary human T lymphoblasts .
The primary T lymphoblasts used in this study have been described previously ( 13 ) and consist of approximately 85 % CD3+ , 59 % CD4+ , and 32 % CD8+ cells .
These lymphoblasts were transfected with the HIV CAT construct , containing the HIV promoter , by using DEAE-dextran .
After transfection , a portion of the T cells was infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) .
Five days after infection with HHV-6 ( GS ) , 30 to 40 % of the cells reacted with HHV-6-specific monoclonal antibodies ( 3 ) by IFA .
This result indicated that the transfected cells were productively infected by HHV-6 ( GS ) .
None of the uninfected lymphocytes reacted with HHV-6-specific monoclonal antibodies , indicating the absence of endogenous HHV-6 virus .
After 5 days in culture , lysates were prepared from the transfected cells and CAT activity was measured ( Fig .
1 ) .
Lysates from transfected T cells without antigen ( PPD ) stimulation and without HHV -6 infection converted 9 % of the chloramphenicol substrate to its acetylated forms , as shown by thin-layer chromatography ( Fig .
1A ) .
This lysate contained a total of 0.12 U of CAT activity ( Fig .
1B and Table 1 ) .
Transfected T-cell blasts activated with antigen showed higher CAT activity than did unstimulated T cells .
Lysates from these cells converted 79 % of the chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms and contained a total of 0.46 U of CAT activity ( Fig .
1C ) .
This represents a fourfold increase in CAT activity after antigenic stimulation ( Table 1 ) .
These experiments confirm our previous studies , which showed that antigen activation of primary T cells can activate the HIV promoter ( 13 ) .
Infection of these transfected T cells with HHV-6 ( GS ) resulted in transactivation of the HIV promoter in both resting and stimulated T cells ( Fig .
1A and C ) .
When lysates from unstimulated , GS-infected T-cell lymphoblasts were tested for CAT activity , there was a conversion of 75 % of the Vor .

are more quantitative and convenient ( 30 ) , subsequent cell lysates were all measured by this rapid method .
These data show that infection of primary T lymphoblasts with HHV-6 ( GS ) activates the HIV promoter in both resting and stimulated primary T cells .
Although the activation in resting cells is not as pronounced ( 5- to 7-fold ) as in antigen-activated T cells ( 22- to 25-fold ) , the data clearly demonstrate that HHV-6 ( GS ) can infect unstimulated primary T cells and will activate the HIV promoter , which otherwise remains quiescent .
Although activation of resting , primary T cells by HHV-6 may have also contributed to the low level of transactivation of the HIV promoter , this alone can not account for all of the transactivation activity observed .
Transactivation of the HIV promoter in antigen-activated primary human T lymphocytes by HHV-6 ( Z29 ) .
Soon after the GS strain of HHV-6 was identified , a new variant strain of HHV-6 was identified which was designated HHV-6 ( Z29 ) ( 5 ) .
HHV-6 ( Z29 ) is related to the GS strain both antigenically and genetically ( 17 , 25 , 41 ) .
Both strains infect human T lymphocytes but seem to have a preference for distinct subsets .
These subsets are still not clearly defined .
The Z29 strain can effectively infect the Molt-3 T-cell line but not HSB-2 , while the GS strain infects HSB-2 but not Molt-3 .
Both HHV-6 strains can infect primary human phtyohemag-glutinin-stimulated blasts , but HHV-6 ( Z29 ) failed to replicate in unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 41 ) .
In this study , primary T lymphoblasts specific for the antigen tuberculin PPD were transfected with the HIV CAT construct and then infected with HHV-6 ( Z29 ) .
After 6 days , the cells were collected and tested for infection with HHV-6 ( Z29 ) by IFA using cross-reactive HHV-6 ( GS ) monoclonal antibodies ( 41 ) .
T lymphocytes stimulated with PPD during the HHV-6 ( Z29 ) infection had enlarged cells and were pos- 2898 HORVAT ET AL .

Shown are representative results from two different donors ; the values in parentheses show the increase in total CAT activity compared with the activity of unstimulated T lymphoblasts .
The total units of CAT activity in unstimulated T cells are 0.09 for donor 2 and 0.011 for donor 4. itive for viral antigens .
However , T cells infected with HHV-6 ( Z29 ) in the absence of antigen stimulation showed no viral antigen-positive cells .
After 6 days of culture , transfected T lymphocytes were collected , washed , and lysed , and the CAT activity was measured from the cell lysates .
The results showed that the HIV CAT promoter was activated only in HHV-6 ( Z29 ) -infected human T lymphocytes that had been stimulated with antigen .
This was explained by the finding that productive infections of T lymphocytes with HHV-6 ( Z29 ) , as determined by IFA with HHV-6-specific antibodies , occurred only in cells stimulated by antigen .
Unstimulated cells did not support viral infection , nor did they demonstrate HIV CAT promoter activation ( 0.09 U of CAT activity in donor 2 ; 0.011 U of CAT activity in donor 4 ) .
As noted above , in primary T cells not infected with HHV-6 ( Z29 ) , the HIV promoter was activated by antigenic stimulation ( 19-fold in donor 2 , with 1.75 U of CAT activity ; 140-fold in donor 4 , with 1.54 U of CAT activity ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
When the transfected T cells were infected with HHV-6 ( Z29 ) in the absence of antigen , no increase in CAT activity was observed ( 0.97-fold in donor 2 , with 0.087 U of CAT activity ; 0.7-fold in donor 4 , with 0.008 U of CAT activity ) .

Schematic diagram of the HIV promoters used in this study .
-57 CAT contained only one Spl site and the TATA box as well as the rat target sequences .
The -147 CAT plasmid contained the NFB site , all of the Sp1 sites , the TATA box , and the tat target region but had lost the negative regulatory region ( NEG reg ) .
The mutant NFB promoter had all regulatory regions intact but had two regions within the NFxB site changed from GGG to TCT .
The intact HIV CAT promoter had no sequence changed or deleted .
3-fold increase in activity over antigenic stimulation alone were noted ( 4.18 U of total CAT activity in donor 2 ; 4.44 U of total CAT activity in donor 4 ) .
These data indicate that HHV-6 ( Z29 ) transactivated the HIV LTR in antigen-stimu-lated , primary , human T lymphocytes and that transactivation by HHV-6 ( Z29 ) requires productive infection of primary T lymphocytes .
Transactivation of the HIV promoter in human T lymphocytes by HHV-6 ( GS ) depends on the presence of a functional NFB enhancer site .
Earlier studies on the activation of the HIV promoter in primary human T lymphocytes showed that activation of the HIV promoter was influenced by the NFB enhancer region as well as an upstream region that exerts negative regulation ( 13 ) .
Several different constructs of the HIV promoter , described in Fig .
3 , were transfected into PPD-specific human T lymphoblasts .
The HIV promoter designated -57 CAT contains one of the Spl sites as well as the TATA site .
This promoter has been shown to be active in other cell types ( COS-7 ; data not shown ) , but little or no promoter activity has ever been observed in primary T lymphocytes ( 13 ) ( Table 1 ) .
The promoter designated -147 CAT retained the NFB binding region as well as the three Spl sites and the TATA box ( Fig .
3 ) .
This promoter does not have the negative regulatory region , and therefore the CAT activity expressed after transfection into primary T lymphoblasts is somewhat higher than with the intact promoter ( Table 1 ) .
T lymphoblasts transfected with -147 CAT and then infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) consistently showed evidence of transactivation ( 9- to 17-fold increase in CAT activity ) .
This finding indicates that the negative regulatory region is not primarily involved in the increased promoter activity due to HHV-6 ( GS ) infection .
These results also show that the DNA sequences responsible for HHV-6 ( GS ) transactivation must be within the -147 to -57 region .
To further locate the specific promoter region responsible for HHV-6 transactivation , the HIV LTR plasmid containing a mutated NFB CAT promoter was transfected into primary T lymphocytes .
This promoter contained two sequences Vor .

CAT activity was measured after 5 days from cell lysate .
Antigen activation of transfected cells was as described for Table 1 .
® See Table 1 , footnote c. within the NFB sites that had been changed from GGG to CTC ( Fig .
3 ) , changes that in the NFB site eliminate the activation of the HIV promoter by the NFB protein ( 27 ) .
This mutation in the NFKB sites abolished the HIV promoter activity induced in primary T lymphoblasts both by antigen and by HHV-6 ( GS ) infection .
Although no CAT activity could be detected in the lysates from these cells , IFA indicated that the population of T cells transfected with the mutant NFB promoter and infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) contained enlarged cells highly positive for HHV-6 ( GS ) proteins ( data not shown ) .
This result showed that the transfected T cells were productively infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) and suggests that HHV-6 ( GS ) requires the NFB region for transactivation of the HIV promoter .
At least three different DNA segments cloned from the HHV-6 ( GS ) genome can transactivate the HIV promoter when cotransfected into primary T lymphocytes .
The HHV-6 ( GS ) genome was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI or HindIII , and the resulting fragments were ligated into the Bluescript vector ( 17 ) .
Six different HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA fragments representing about 40 % of the total viral genome and varying in length from 3.3 to 21.4 kb ( 17 ) were used in these studies .
Each HHV-6 ( GS ) fragment was cotransfected with HIV CAT into the primary T-cell populations , and CAT activity was measured in cell lysates 5 days later .
The largest fragment , pZVB70 ( 21.4 kb ) , showed a dramatic transactivating effect on the HIV promoter ( Table 2 ) .
In the absence of antigen , this fragment increased HIV promoter activity 26 to 101 times over the activity expressed in unstimulated T cells .
When the cells were stimulated with antigen , there was a 77- to 271-fold increase in total CAT activity , which was 6-to 42-fold over the antigenic stimulation alone .
It was the major DNA fragment from HHV-6 ( GS ) that showed this level of activity , and as such it was designated a high transactivator of the HIV promoter .

Total CAT activity from transfected HSB-2 cells .
( A ) HSB-2 cells were transfected with HIV CAT only ( - ) and then infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) .
Cells were also cotransfected with HIV CAT and various HHV-6 cloned DNA fragments : pZVB70 ( B70 ) , pZVH14 ( H14 ) , pZVB10 ( B10 ) , and pZVB43 ( B43 ) .
( B ) HSB-2 cells were also transfected with mutant NFkB CAT plasmid .
Some of the cells were infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) , while others were left uninfected ( - ) .
A portion of the cells were cotransfected with various HHV-6 DNA clones as described above .
( Table 2 ) when expressed in the absence of antigen stimulation .
The DNA clone pZVH14 contained a 8.7-kb fragment from HHV-6 ( GS ) , while clone pZVB10 contained a 6.2-kb fragment .
Since these HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA clones showed only low-level activation of HIV CAT in the absence of antigen and promoter activity in antigen-stimulated cells increased only slightly , we have designated these clones low transac-tivators .
The highest transactivation was observed when cotransfected T lymphocytes were stimulated with antigen , suggesting an additive effect of antigenic stimulation and the HHV-6 ( GS ) gene product ( s ) on HIV promoter activity .
Table 2 also shows data for three fragments cloned from HHV-6 ( GS ) that failed to transactivate the HIV promoter .
These DNA clones were designated pZVB9 ( 11.8-kb fragment ) , pZVB43 ( 8.3-kb fragment ) , and pZVB15 ( 3.3-kb fragment ) .
From these results , it can be concluded that HHV-6 contains at least three different gene segments that can transactivate the HIV promoter .
To confirm the data observed in primary T lymphocytes , these fragments were also cotransfected with HIV CAT into the human T-cell line HSB-2 ( Fig .
4A ) .
As previously demonstrated ( 14 ) , infection of the transfected HSB-2 cells with HHV-6 ( GS ) resulted in an increase in CAT activity ( threefold ) , indicating that the HIV promoter was also transactivated in a T-cell line .
Cotransfection of HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA clone pZVB70 and HIV CAT resulted in a dramatic increase in CAT activity ( 58-fold ; Fig .
4A ) .
Plasmid pZVB70 transactivated HIV CAT to a much greater extent than did HHV-6 ( GS ) .
It was also observed that plasmid pZVH14 , when cotransfected with HIV CAT into the HSB-2 T-cell line , activated promoter activity to a higher level than did HHV-6 ( GS ) .
The CAT activity in these samples increased 30-fold over the activity of HSB-2 cells transfected with HIV CAT alone .
This finding suggests that during HHV-6 ( GS ) infection , the gene products from these DNA segments are under some type of regulation that is lost when the genes are cloned into plasmids .
Cotransfection of HSB-2 cells with two other HHV-6 fragments , pZVB10 and pZV B43 , did not show any transactivation of HIV CAT .
These data confirm our observation in primary T lymphocytes , that the gene segments contained in plasmids pZVB70 and pZVH14 transactivated the HIV promoter ; however , unlike the situation 2900 HORVAT ET AL .

Cells were incubated for 5 days as described for Table 1 .
Total CAT activity was measured in cell lysates .
* See Table 1 , footnote c. for primary T cells , pZVB10 failed to activate the HIV promoter in HSB-2 cells .
To determine whether mutations in the NFB site of the HIV promoter affected the transactivation by cloned HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA fragments , the three transactivating fragments were cotransfected into primary T cells with the promoter containing the NFkB mutation .
The resulting promoter activities are shown in Table 3 .
Mutation in the NFkB site completely abolished the ability of the pZVB70 and pZVB10 clones to transactivate .
However , with the pZVH14 clone , a slight but consistent transactivation was observed ( four- to sevenfold ) that was less than the transactivation seen with the intact HIV promoter .
The transactivation of the mutated NFkB promoter by pZVH14 was not dependent on antigenic stimulation of the T cells , since it was not enhanced by the presence of antigen .
Similar results were observed when these cloned DNA fragments were cotransfected with the mutated NFB promoter into HSB-2 cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
The two DNA clones , pZVB70 and pZVB10 , failed to transactivate the mutated NFkB promoter , but pZVH14 showed slight transactivation ( 8- to 10-fold ) .
This finding confirmed the results in primary T lymphocytes .
Together , these data suggest that the transactivating gene ( s ) included within the pZVH14 clone may not totally depend on an intact NFkB site but may also use other target DNA region ( s ) in the promoter .
DISCUSSION Our studies demonstrate that two strains of HHV-6 , GS and Z29 , can infect and activate the HIV promoter in primary , human T lymphocytes .
However , these two strains of HHV-6 showed distinct differences in ability to transactivate the HIV promoter , related to the ability of the two strains to productively infect resting T lymphocytes .
HHV-6 ( GS ) infected both stimulated and unstimulated human T cells , while HHV-6 ( Z29 ) infected only stimulated T cells .
This observation confirms the results of Wyatt et al .
( 41 ) , who showed that HHV-6 ( Z29 ) failed to replicate in nonacti-vated peripheral blood lymphocytes .
HHV-6 ( Z29 ) was unable to infect resting T cells , and no transactivation of the HIV promoter was observed .
However , HHV-6 ( GS ) transactivated the HIV promoter even in resting T cells .
These data suggest that active replication of HHV-6 ( Z29 ) and subsequent production of its gene products are required for transactivation of the HIV promoter .
It is also possible that J. Viror .
HHV-6 ( Z29 ) requires essential cellular elements that are provided by antigenic stimulation of T cells for its replication , and thus the activation of the HIV promoter by Z29 may require cellular cooperation .
Ensoli et al .
( 8 ) have previously shown that HHV-6 ( GS ) infection of HIV-infected T cells increases the steady-state level of HIV mRNA that parallels CAT enzymatic activity .
It is quite possible that similar mechanisms are responsible for the increase in CAT enzymatic activity observed here .
Studies are currently under way to examine the mechanism of action by the cloned gene fragments .
Certain difficulties are inherent in these types of experi-ments .
We have observed differences in HIV promoter activation between different donors and even from the same donor when cells were donated at different times ( 6 months later ) .
Without HHV infection or antigenic stimulation , the background CAT activity ranged between 0.01 and 0.38 total U of enzyme activity .
Because the increase in promoter activity is based on the background activity between donors or experiments , this parameter can not be used to compare promoter activity but must be used to measure transactivation within a single experiment .
This was not expected , since these experiments require many steps of long incubation periods .
Because of the large number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells needed for each experiment ( > 100 x 10° ) , donors were only bled every 6 weeks .
However , each transfection was done at least twice on two different healthy adult human donors .
Therefore , when transactivation was observed consistently in all experiments , we concluded that there was activation of the HIV promoter in these situations .
A number of experiments were performed to identify the region of the HIV promoter required for transactivation by HHV-6 ( GS ) .
In earlier studies , several deletions or mutations in the HIV promoter were used to determine which promoter regions were essential for control of the promoter activity during primary in vitro T-cell stimulation ( 13 ) .
These altered promoters were also used in this study , and the results showed that the NFkB region was essential for transactivation during HHV-6 ( GS ) infection .
Thus , an HIV promoter containing mutated sequences within the NFB region was no longer activated by HHV-6 ( GS ) infection .
It is not known whether HHV-6 ( GS ) directly activates the NFB cellular protein or , alternatively , a HHV-6 ( GS ) gene product ( s ) binds directly to the NFB region .
However , these results to indicate that this particular promoter region seems to be essential for HHV-6 ( GS ) transactivation during an active infection .
Similar results were observed when the human T-cell line HSB-2 was transfected with the mutated NFB promoter and then infected with HHV-6 ( GS ) .
HHV-6 ( GS ) is not unique in using the NFxB site , since it has been noted that other herpesviruses , such as herpes simplex virus type 1 , cytomegalovirus , and Epstein-Barr virus , also act on the NFB region of the HIV promoter ( 22 ) .
The genome of HHV-6 ( GS ) has been estimated to be about 170 kb in length ( 17 , 18 ) , which should code for more than 70 proteins .
A number of DNA cloned fragments from the GS genome were examined in this study to determine whether they code for products that transactivate the HIV promoter .
Several HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA clones , comprising about 40 % of the viral genome , were individually cotransfected with HIV CAT into primary human T lymphocytes .
Three different non-cross-hybridizing DNA clones transactivated the HIV promoter , and at present it is not known whether other HHV-6 DNA fragments are also able to transactivate the HIV promoter .
The DNA clone showing the highest level of transactivation ( pZVB70 ) contained 21.4 Vor .
65 , 1991 kb of HHV-6 ( GS ) DNA .
It is possible that more than one gene product expressed from this plasmid is responsible for the high level of transactivating ability of this plasmid .
Since these fragments were not inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector , their expression requires endogenous promoter activity .
It can thus be inferred from these data that at least some of the HHV-6 promoters must be active in both stimulated and unstimulated primary T cells .
Two other plasmids containing HHV-6 ( GS ) fragments also transactivated the HIV promoter in primary T cells .
These plasmids were pZVH14 , which contained an 8.7-kb viral fragment , and pZVB10 , which contained a 6.2-kb fragment .
To determine the nature of the open reading frames present in these fragments , the DNA was sequenced ( data not shown ) .
From this information , several genes have been identified and are currently been subcloned and tested for transactivating ability on the HIV promoter in human T cells .
Although the pZVH14 clone was less active than pZVB70 , it transactivated HIV CAT in the T-cell line HSB-2 and in primary T cells .
Of interest was the observation that this fragment , pZVH14 , was unique in transactivating the mutant NFB promoter even in the absence of antigenic stimulation .
No such activity was seen after GS infection of T cells or transfection of primary T cells with the two transactivating DNA fragments from GS , pZVB70 and pZVB10 .
These data also suggest that the gene products expressed from pZVH14 are able to act on regions other than the NFxB site , independent of antigenic stimulation .
This also implies that gene expression from this DNA fragment is possible even without overt cellular stimulation .
Since transactivation of the mutant NFB was not observed during an actual infection with HHV-6 ( GS ) , the gene ( s ) contained within the pZVH14 DNA fragment must be under some type of regulatory control .
A recent study has shown that the pZVH14 genomic fragment also has oncogenic properties ( 32 ) .
At present it is not known whether the gene product ( s ) the induce transformation in NIH 3T3 cells is the same product ( s ) responsible for transactivation of the HIV promoter .
The immunodeficiency disease AIDS is a chronic disease caused by the human retrovirus HIV .
The time from HIV infection to the clinical manifestation of AIDS can range from 2 months to more than a decade ( 2 , 15 , 16 ) .
An important determinant of the length of this latency period is the rate of HIV replication .
Factors that accelerate HIV replication increase the progression of the disease .
After HIV infection of human T cells in vitro , the virus undergoes a form of latency until activated by mitogens or specific antigens ( 42 ) .
In vitro stimulation of T cells increases HIV promoter activity ( 13 , 40 ) , which can terminate HIV latency .
Thus , activation of the HIV promoter can be a factor in the length of the latency period .
On the basis of their ability to activate the HIV promoter , other DNA viruses , such as herpes simplex virus type 1 , cytomegalovirus , Epstein-Barr virus ( 22 ) , papovaviruses ( 11 ) , adenoviruses ( 28 ) , and hepatitis B virus ( 36 ) , have been implicated as possible cofactors in AIDS .
Recent studies have shown that the herpesvirus cytomegalovirus enhances the replication of HIV in coinfected cells ( 37 ) , and cells productively infected with both CMV and HIV have been found in the brains of AIDS patients ( 29 ) .
These studies indicate that it is possible for DNA viruses , especially herpesviruses , to activate HIV even in vivo .
HHV-6 infects primarily CD4+ human T cells , the same cells infected with HIV .
Several investigators have shown that peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be productively coinfected with HHV-6 and HIV ( 6 , 24 , 26 ) .
In fact , many of TRANSACTIVATION OF THE HIV LTR BY HHV-6 2901 the initial HHV-6 strains were isolated from individuals suffering from AIDS ( 25 , 35 , 39 ) .
Therefore , it seems likely that coinfection of human T cells with HHV-6 and HIV could accelerate the immunodeficiency disease caused by HIV .
Ensoli et al .
( 8 ) showed that T-cell line HSB-2 could be productively coinfected with HHV-6 and HIV , resulting in accelerated cell death and increased HIV transcription .
In the present study , the HIV promoter was activated in HHV-6-infected , primary human T lymphoblasts .
In contrast , recent reports have shown that coinfection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with HHV-6 and HIV suppressed HIV replication ( 6 , 24 ) .
The differences between these studies may be due to the nature of the cells that were infected , dosage of virus , and time of infection .
In the present study , 85 to 89 % of the transfected cells were human T lymphoblasts , whereas the other studies ( 6 , 24 ) used stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells which contained a variety of cell types .
It has been demonstrated that HHV-6 infects numerous cell types present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , including monocytes and B cells ( 25 , 26 , 39 ) .
Since the mechanism of HIV inhibition by HHV-6 in these studies is not known , it still remains possible that HHV-6 infection of cell types other than T cells contributes to suppression of HIV replication through cytokine production .
This study has demonstrated that HHV-6 gene products can activate the HIV promoter in primary human T lymphoblasts .
Therefore , an active HHV-6 infection of human T cells can activate an otherwise quiescent HIV promoter .
This promoter activation can lead to an increased HIV replication and consequently enhances T-cell death .
In addition , the replication of HHV-6 itself is cytopathic for T cells , which would start a cycle of increased T-cell death .
By this proposed mechanism , an active HHV-6 infection would accelerate the progression of AIDS .
