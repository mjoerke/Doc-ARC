3 Identification of Nucleotide Sequences That Regulate Transcription of the MCF13 Murine Leukemia Virus Long Terminal Repeat in Activated T Cells FAYTH K. YOSHIMURA , * MILENA CANKOVIC , RONALD SMELTZ , AND SITI IBRAHIM Department of Immunology and Microbiology , Wayne State University , Detroit , Michigan 48201 Received 1 August 1996/Accepted 27 November 1996 The region downstream of the enhancer ( DEN ) of the long terminal repeat of the mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus is important for viral pathogenicity .
Another important activity of DEN is its control of transcription in activated T cells , and we have determined that an NF-KB site is critical for this activity .
Our studies of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region that lies between the enhancer and promoter ( DEN , for downstream of enhancer ; Fig .
1 ) of a mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus ( MCF MLV ) have shown that this region is important for the pathogenicity of this retrovirus , which induces thymic lymphoma ( 27 ) .
Deletion of the DEN region attenuated the lymphomagenicity of the MCF13 MLV ( 27 ) .
Our analysis of the transcriptional activity of the MCF13 DEN sequences revealed that it is the only region of the LTR that controls transcription in activated T cells ( 11 ) .
To identify the nucleotide sequences that regulate the transcriptional activity of DEN in activated T cells , we performed gel shift assays to detect protein-DNA complexes that are unique for activated T cells .
We compared the binding of nuclear protein isolated from Jurkat T cells grown under different conditions to a °°P-labeled DEN DNA fragment that corresponded to the region between the RsaI and DraI sites of the MCF13 LTR ( Fig .
1 ) .
P-labeled DEN DNA ( 1 ng ) was incubated with 4 g of nuclear extract and 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Boehringer Mannheim ) in 10 mM HEPES ( N-2-hydroxyeth-ylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ pH 8.0 ] ) -50 mM NaCl-1 mM EDTA-0.25 mM EGTA-7 mM B-mercaptoctha-nol-10 % glycerol for 30 min at room temperature .
Samples subsequently were electrophoresed through a 4 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.3X TBE buffer ( 1X TBE is 81 mM Tris base , 81 mM boric acid , and 1.8 mM EDTA ) at 17 V/cm for 2 h at room temperature .
Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with a DuPont Lightning Plus intensifying screen at -70°C .
The results of this gel shift comparison are shown in Fig .
2A .
Nuclear extracts used for binding were isolated from Jurkat cells that were either unactivated ( lane 2 ) , activated with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( TPA ) and ionomycin ( lane 3 ) , or treated only with ionomycin ( lane 4 ) or TPA ( lane 5 ) .
We detected a major band ( indicated by an arrow ) that was seen with nuclear extract from activated T cells ( lane 3 ) .
Competition gel shift assays revealed that this major band represented specific protein binding to DEN ( Fig .
2B ) .
For these assays either unlabeled DEN DNA ( lanes 3 to 5 ) or lambda DNA digested with BsfEI restriction endonuclease ( lanes 6 to 8 ) was * Corresponding author .

2572 preincubated with nuclear extract from activated Jurkat cells prior to the addition of the labeled probe .
DNase I footprinting was performed to identify the protected bases for the specific protein-DNA complex detectable only with activated T-cell nuclear extract ( Fig .
3A ) .
DEN DNA that contained either °°P-labeled coding or noncoding strand was reacted with nuclear extract from Jurkat cells treated with TPA and ionomycin and digested with DNase I before elec-trophoresis through a 4 % polyacrylamide gel .
DNA was eluted from the specific complex ( Fig .
2 ) and after phenol/chloroform extraction was electrophoresed through an 8 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel .
Footprints of the bound complexes ( Fig .
3A , lanes 4 and 8 ) included either a complete consensus sequence for the NF-kB transcription factor ( 4 , 19 ) , which is denoted by brackets ( 5'-GGGACTTITTCC-3 ' ) for the noncoding strand ( lane 4 ) , or the 5'-half of the NF- « B site ( 5'-GGA AA-3 '' ) for the coding strand ( lane 8 ) .
For the noncoding strand we also detected protection of six bases ( 5'-GAAACT -3 ' ) that constitute the 3 ' portion of the MLPal protein binding site that we determined is able to regulate transcription specifically in T cells ( 27 , 31 ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
Bases that were protected for the noncoding and coding strands are indicated by a bold line in Fig .
3B .
Because we observed only partial protection of the NF- « B site for the coding strand , we used recombinant NF-kB p50 protein ( Promega Corp. ) in a DNase I footprint reaction and obtained similar results ( compare lanes 8 and 9 of Fig .
3A ) .
Thus , NF-kB binding under our conditions resulted in only partial protection of the coding strand .
The functional significance of the NF-kB and the 3 ' half of the MLPal protein-binding sites for the transcriptional activity of DEN in activated T cells was examined by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene construct that was used to originally identify DEN activity ( 11 ) .
In addition to the NF-kB and MLPal protein binding sites in DEN , there are sites for other transcription elements , such as ets and GATA ( Fig .
4 ) , which regulate transcription in T lymphocytes ( 15-17 , 21 ) .
Because the ets , GATA , and other potential binding sites may not have been detectable by our gel shift and DNase I footprinting assays because of possible differences in the abundancy of their cognate proteins , we mutated the entire DEN region to identify any additional elements that may regulate transcription in activated T cells .
Mutagenesis was performed by substituting the BamHI restriction endonuclease recognition sequence for each identifiable protein binding site or random sequences Vor .

( 24 ) ( Amersham ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing ( Pharmacia ALFexpress instrument ; Macromolec-ular Core Facility at the Wayne State University Medical School ) .
The mutants are designated in Table 1 and Fig .
4 either by the name of the transcription element that is mutated or the first nucleotide in that particular mutated sequence .
The numbering of the nucleotides is based on the sequence of the MCF13 LTR that we have published ( 29 ) .
The transcriptional activity of each mutant was compared with the wild-type DEN clone ( wtDEN ) in Jurkat cells that were activated by treatment with TPA and ionomycin ( Table 1 ) .
The CAT activity of each clone is expressed as a percent of the activity of the wild-type DEN clone .
We performed transient expression assays by detecting CAT enzymatic activity in total cellular protein that was extracted from cells 48 h after transfection with Lipofectin ( GIBCO/BRL ) as described by Chen and Yoshimura ( 11 ) .
We observed that mutations of the NF-KB site had the greatest effect on DEN activity , with reductions to 14.1 and 11.2 % of wild-type activity for m5'-NF- « B -TPA +TPA -TPA +TPA -ION +I0N +I0N ION A DEN \ B _ .

Mutations of six additional sites ( m279 , m287 , m3'MLPal , m323 , m333 , and mets ) each had a moderate effect on transcription , with activities ranging from 38 to 57 % of that of the wild type .
The m279 , m287 , and m3'-MLPal mutations affect sequences in the MLP protein binding site , which we have observed to bind multiple proteins ( 30 ) and which is juxtaposed with the NF-kB site ( Fig .
4 ) .
It has been observed that the activity of NF-xB often requires interactions with other transacting factors ( 18 , 23 , 25 , 26 ) .
Because our DNase I footprint analysis indicated that the 3 ' segment of the MLPal site is occupied by protein , it is possible for NF-kB to interact with some of the proteins that bind MLPal .
Although Ets binding sites that regulate transcription have been identified in the promoter and/or enhancer regions of the LTR of T-cell lym-phomagenic MLVs ( 13 , 14 ) , including MCF13 , this is the first observation of a functional ets site in the DEN region .
Because the BamHI recognition sequence contains a potential Ets binding site ( 13 ) , the effect of this element on transcription may be greater than what we have observed .

Protein binding sites and mutations in the DEN region .
Protein binding sites for the GATA , MLPal , NF-kB , and Ets proteins are delineated by boxes .
The numbers above the sequence correspond to those of the MCF13 LTR that we have published ( 29 ) .
Bases within DEN that were mutated are underlined .
tated in m333 were identified as part of the enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene ( 1 ) for which no DNA-binding protein has yet been identified .
A nucleotide sequence search revealed no transcription factor site that corresponds to the bases mutated in m323 .
Competition gel shift assays confirmed the presence of NF-KB in nuclear extract from activated Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2C ) .
Protein binding to a °°P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for NF-xB was effectively competed by the cognate unlabeled oligonucleotide ( lanes 3 to 6 ) but not an oligonucleotide containing the sequence of the MLPal protein-binding site ( lanes 7 to 10 ) .
Although NF-kB is ubiquitously expressed , its activity is especially critical for the transcriptional regulation of cytokine-inducible gene expression , including those involved in the activation of T cells ( 4 , 6 , 12 ) .
When T cells are stimulated by antigen presentation , mitogens , or cytokines , NF-kB is released from its inhibitor , IxB in the cytosol , and is translocated to the nucleus , where it transactivates cellular genes , such as the interleukin-2 and interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain genes ( 2-4 , 6 ) .
Besides its activation of cellular genes , NF-KB also regulates the transcription of viral genes , including those of retroviruses ( 7 , 8 , 22 ) .
The role of NF-KB in the transcriptional activation of the LTR of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been well documented ( 4 , 12 , 22 ) .
More recently it has been observed that NF- « B and/or other Rel-related proteins are required for the transcriptional regulation of the LTR of other retroviruses , such as the bovine leukemia virus ( 8 ) and the avian leukosis virus ( 7 ) .

Each value represents the mean + standard deviation of at least two independent transfec-tions performed in at least two different experiments .
The range of CAT activity was 0.3 x 10° to 6 x 10° cpm after correction for background ( approximately 3 % 10° cpm ) .
More than one plasmid preparation for each clone was tested .
the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein ( 5 , 20 ) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this human retrovirus .
Our data do not indicate which NF- « xB/Rel family member binds the MCF13 LTR .
However , it has been shown that the predominant proteins of this family in T lymphocytes and the thymus are p50 , c-Rel , RelA , and ReIB ( 4 , 9 , 10 , 28 ) .
Because the DEN region is important for MCF lymphomagenesis , it will be intriguing to determine whether the role of in the transcriptional control of the LTR in activated T cells is also required for viral pathogenicity .
