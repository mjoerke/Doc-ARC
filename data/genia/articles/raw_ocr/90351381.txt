The erythroid transcription factor erythroid factor-1 ( EF1 ) plays a critical role in the transcription of erythroid-specific genes .
Here we report the presence of a factor with the mobility and sequence-specific DNA-binding characteristics of EF 1 at low abundance in a wide variety of non-erythroid cell types .
This is the first report of an EFl-like activity in non-erythroid cells and indicates that this factor may play a role in the regulation of genes expressed in such cells .
INTRODUCTION The transcriptional regulation of many cellular genes is mediated by the binding of cell-type-specific factors , present in only one or a few tissues , to regulatory elements within the promoters or enhancers of such genes ( for review , see Maniatis et al. , 1987 ) .
In particular , the promoters and enhancers of many genes expressed specifically in chicken or mammalian erythroid cells , such as the globin genes and the porphobilinogen deaminase gene , contain a sequence with the consensus A/TGATAA/G ( Evans et al. , 1988 ; Wall et al. , 1988 ; Plumb et al. , 1989 ; Mignotte et al. , 1989 ) .
This sequence acts as the binding site for a transcription factor which is present at high levels in cells of the erythroid lineage and has been variously referred to as EFI ( Perkins et al. , 1989 ) , EryFl ( Evans et al. , 1988 ) , NF-E1 ( Wall et al. , 1988 ) and GF-1 ( Tsai et al. , 1989 ) .
Here we refer to this factor as EFI .
A variety of evidence suggests that EFI plays a critical role in the activation of erythroid-specific gene expression .
Thus deletion or mutation of the EFl binding sites within erythroid-specific genes reduces or abolishes their expression in erythroid cells ( Kollias et a/. , 1987 ; Behringer et al. , 1987 ; Reitman & Felsenfeld , 1988 ) .
Moreover , partially affinity-purified chicken EFI protein has recently been shown to stimulate the transcription of a chicken # hatching globin gene in a site-specific manner upon co-injection into Xeropus oocytes ( G. A. Partington , W. D. Perkins , R. H. Nicolas & G. H. Goodwin , unpublished work ) .
In agreement with its critical role in erythroid gene expression , EFI has been detected at high levels in cells of all stages of the erythroid lineage , and has not previously been observed in non-erythroid cells ( Evans et al. , 1988 ; Galson & Houseman , 1988 ; Wall et al. , 1988 ; Tsai et al. , 1988 ; Plumb et al. , 1989 ) .
We report here , however , that a factor with identical binding specificity and gel-retardation mobility to EFI is present in a wide range of human and murine non-erythroid cells , although at levels considerably lower than those observed for EF 1 in erythroid cells .
In addition to its role in the control of erythroid gene expression , EFI may also therefore play a role in the regulation of gene expression in non-erythroid cells .
EXPERIMENTAL Gel retardation assays Protein and DNA were mixed in a binding buffer that consisted of 4 % ( w/v ) Ficoll , 20 mm-Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mm-NaCl or -KCl and 1 mm-MgCl , in a final volume of 20 wl .
The incubations were carried out on ice for 45 min .
Typically , 5-10 fmol of *°P-end-labelled probe DNA ( > 10° c.p.m./ug ) was used in each incubation .
For a 0.3 m-NaCl nuclear extract , approx .
1.5-2.0 ug of protein was added to each incubation .
For these concentrations of protein , 5 ug of non-specific competitor , poly ( dI-dC ) DNA was added to each incubation .
Competitor DNAs were added as detailed in Figure legends .
The protein was always the final component to be added to the gel retardation mixture .
After incubation , each gel retardation was loaded directly on to a 4 % ( w/v ) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25 x TBE ( 0.089 m-Tris/borate , 0.089 m-boric acid , 0.002 m-EDTA ) , pre-run for 45 min .
The gel was run at 4°C for 90-180 min depending on the size of the probe DNA , at a constant 150 V and 5 mA .
After electrophoresis the gel was dried and then autoradiographed .
Nuclear protein extractions All solutions contained the proteinase inhibitors phenyl-methanesulphonyl fluoride ( 0.5 mm ) benzamidine ( 0.5 mM ) , aprotinin ( 1 4g /ml ) , pepstatin A ( 1 ug/ml ) , leupeptin ( 2 4g/ml ) and bestatin ( 5 ug and the phosphatase inhibitors levamisole ( 2 mm ) and # -glycerophosphate ( 10 mm ) .
Sodium butyrate ( 10 mm ) was included throughout .
All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4°C and were essentially those described in Perkins et al .
( 1989 ) .
The number of cells was counted in a Coulter counter .
A typical preparation used approx .
10 '' cells .
The cells were spun down at 1000 g and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ; - 137 mm-NaCl/2.7 mm-KCI1/8 mm-sodium - phosphate , pH 7.2 ) .
The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm-Tris/HCl ( pH 7.5 ) /5 mm-MgC1 , /0.05 % ( v/v ) Triton X-100 and lysed with 20 strokes in a 1 ml Dounce homogenizer .
Jurkat T-cells were first incubated on ice for 10 min in the above buffer with no Triton X-100 before being spun down and resuspended in 10 mm-Tris/HCl ( pH 7.5 ) /5 mm-MgC1 , /0.25 m-sucrose ( kept in buffers for all the Jurkat T-cell extraction procedure ) and lysed as above in the absence of Triton .
The nuclei were pelleted by spinning in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 10000 g for 15 min at 4 °C .
The nuclei pellet volume was estimated and then the pellet was resuspended in an equivalent volume of 10 mm-Tris/HCl ( pH 7.5 ) /5 mm-MgCl , , followed by the addition of 1 nuclei pellet vol .

269 544 that the final concentration of NaCl was 0.33 m. The lysing nuclei were left on ice for 30 min before being centrifuged at 10000 g for 15 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C .
The supernatant was removed and could then be used immediately .
If it was to be stored , 80 % ( v/v ) glycerol was added , such that the final glycerol concentration was 20 % ( v/v ) and then the sample was frozen at -70 °C .
HeLa and K562 cell nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence of all proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors by the method of Dignam et al .
( 1983 ) .
Human T-cell nuclear extract , prepared as for Jurkat T-cells , was provided by Dr. M. Crompton ( Institute of Cancer Research ) and Dr. D. Cantrell ( Imperial Cancer Research Fund ) .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to detect EF1 binding activity , we carried out a gel retardation experiment using an oligonucleotide containing a high-affinity EF1 binding site from the mouse « -globin promoter and nuclear extracts from a variety of cell types prepared as previously described ( Perkins et al. , 1989 ) .
As expected , an EFI binding activity ( labelled ' a ' in Fig .
1 ) was readily detectable using small amounts of extracts prepared from the mouse erythroleukaemia cell line MEL ( Fig .
1 , track 1 ) or the human erythroleukaemia cell line K562 ( Fig .
1 , track 2 ) .
More surprisingly , retarded bands indicative of proteins binding to the EF1 site were also detected using large amounts of extracts prepared from HeLa cells ( Fig .
1 , track 3 ) , resting human T-cells prepared as described by Cantrell & Smith ( 1984 ) ( Fig .
1 , track 4 ) , murine F9 embryonal carcinoma cells ( Fig .
1 , track 5 ) and the human T-cell line Jurkat ( Fig .
2¢c ) .
A variety of bands representing proteins binding to the probe were observed in these non-erythroid extracts , including a band of mobility identical to that of the major band seen in erythroid cells ( labelled a ) , two bands of higher mobility ( labelled b and c ) and Fig .

DNA mobility shift assay using the same oligonucleotide and extracts as in Fig .
1 Samples used were : ( a ) 1 wg of protein of K562 extract ; ( b ) 40 ug of protein of HeLa extract ; ( c ) 20 ug of protein of extract from the human T-cell line Jurkat ; ( 4 ) 20 4g of protein of purified human T-cell extract ; ( e ) 20 ug of protein of F9 cell extract .
The assays were performed in the absence of competing oligonucleotide ( track 1 ) , or in the presence of a 100-fold excess of oligonucleotides containing the identical sequence to the probe ( track 2 ) , the sequence of the EFI binding sites B ( track 3 ) and C ( track 4 ) from the chicken # hatching globin gene promoter ( Perkins et al. , 1989 ) , a mutated site C which does not bind EFI ( track 5 ) or an octamer-binding motif ( track 6 ) .
In track 7 , competition was carried out using an equivalent mass of pBR322 plasmid DNA .
The arrows indicate the bands labelled as in Fig .
1. bands of lower mobility which appeared to be specific to non-erythroid cells ( labelled x and y ) .
To investigate the relationship of these binding factors to the EF1 expressed in erythroid cells , we carried out a competition analysis of factor binding using the same cell extracts and also a 1990 Erythroid factor-1 nuclear extract prepared from the human T-cell line Jurkat ( Fig .
2 ) .
Interestingly , in the competition experiments , band a , which is identical in size to erythroid EFI , showed binding characteristics identical to those of erythroid EFI in each cell type .
Thus its binding was competed for by a 100-fold excess of identical unlabelled probe oligonucleotide ( track 2 ) or by oligonucleotides containing two different EF1 binding sites from the chicken # hatching globin gene promoter ( tracks 3 and 4 ) , but not by an oligonucleotide containing the octamer motif which binds the unrelated transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 ( track 6 ) or by an equivalent molar mass of plasmid pBR322 DNA ( track 7 ) .
Moreover , no competition for binding of the band a protein was observed with an oligonucleotide containing a mutated version of the EF1 binding site in the # hatching globin promoter which fails to bind erythroid EFI ( Fig .
2 , track 5 ) .
Hence this protein , in addition to being the same size as erythroid EFI , binds specifically to the EF !
binding site in a manner similar to EFI .
In competition experiments using all the cellular extracts ( see Fig .
2 ) , bands b and c were competed with much less effectively than band a by the competitor DNAs , though to some extent they show the same specificity of competition and may be related to EFI .
In K562 cells , a band labelled a ' shows an identical pattern of competition with EFI and may therefore represent a degradation product or alternative form of EFI .
Bands x and y observed in non-erythroid cells did show a sequence-specific pattern of binding , but with different characteristics than EFI .
Thus these bands were competed for by the probe EFI site ( track 2 ) and the mutated EF 1 site ( track 5 ) , but not by the non-specific competitors ( tracks 6 and 7 ) or by the EF 1 sites from the chicken { hatching globin gene ( tracks 3 and 4 ) .
They are relatively more abundant in T-cells than in Jurkat cells or F9 cells , and are barely detectable in HeLa cells .
The nature of these proteins and their relationship to EFI is unclear , although the factor we observe at a very low level in HeLa cells ( Fig .
1 , track 3 ) may be related to the factors observed in these cells by Brady et a/ .
( 1989 ) and Mignotte et al .
( 1989 ) which bind to an EFI site but are of different mobility to erythroid EFI .
In conclusion , it is clear that non-erythroid cells contain a protein with the size and binding characteristics of erythroid cell EF1 .
The levels of this protein in non-erythroid cells are 10-100-fold lower than in erythroid cells , and much larger amounts of non-erythroid extracts must therefore be used in order to detect this factor .
Our ability to detect this low level of non-erythroid EF whereas others have not is likely to be due to the use of a high-affinity binding site in the gel retardation assay , coupled with the preparation of nuclear extracts in the presence of a variety of proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors .
Received 26 January 1990/23 April 1990 ; accepted 27 April 1990 545 It is likely that the EF1-like factor we describe here is widely distributed in non-erythroid cells .
We have detected it in cells as disparate as HeLa cells , T-cells and embryonal carcinoma cells , and have also observed an EFIl-like activity in Xenopus oocytes ( G. A. Partington , N. D. Perkins , R. H. Nicolas & G. H. Goodwin , unpublished work ) .
Similarly , a factor binding to an EFI site in the rat elastase gene promoter has been observed by others in pancreatic cells ( Kruse et al. , 1988 ) .
Moreover , our detection of the EFl-like factor in resting T-cells obtained from human blood indicates that it is not confined to immortalized cell lines but is present also in normal human non-erythroid cells .
It is clear , therefore , that an EFl-like factor or family of factors is expressed in many non-erythroid cell types , although at a lower level than EFI in erythroid cells , and may therefore play a role in the regulation of genes expressed in non-erythroid cells .
We thank Doreen Cantrell and Mark Crompton for the extract from resting T-cells , Mike O'Hare for F9 cells and Rob Nicolas and Geoff Partington for helpful discussions .
