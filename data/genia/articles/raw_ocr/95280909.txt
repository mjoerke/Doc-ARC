WILKIE* ** Department of Molecular Genetics , The Ohio State University , Division of Hematology and Oncology , The Ohio State University Hospitals , '' and The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute , Columbus , Ohio 43210 Received 17 November 1994/Returned for modification 6 January 1995/Accepted 23 March 1995 Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1 « ) and its human equivalent ( GOS19 , LD78 , or AT464 ) are members of the -C-C- family of low-molecular-weight chemokines .
Secreted from activated T cells and macrophages , bone marrow-derived MIP-1 « /GOS19 inhibits primitive hematopoietic stem cells and appears to be involved in the homeostatic control of stem cell proliferation .
It also induces chemotaxis and inflammatory responses in mature cell types .
Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms which control the expression of MIP-I « /GOS19 .
Previous work has shown that in Jurkat T cells , a set of widely expressed transcription factors ( the ICK-1 family ) affect the GOS19 promoter .
One member , ICK-1A , behaves as a strong negative regulator , In this communication , we provide evidence that the pathway of induction in the macrophage cell line U937 is different from that in Jurkat cells .
Furthermore , we show that the ICK-1 binding site does not confer negative regulation in U937 cells .
We provide evidence for an additional binding site , the MIP-1 @ nuclear protein ( MNP ) site , which overlaps the ICK-1 site .
Interaction of nuclear extracts from various cell lines and tissue with the MNP site leads to the formation of fast-migrating protein-DNA complexes with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities .
A mutation of the MNP site which does not abrogate ICK-1 binding inactivates the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells .
We propose that the MNP protein ( s ) binding at the MNP site constitutes a novel transcription factor ( s ) expressed in hematopoietic cells .
Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1 « [ 48 ] ) and its human equivalent ( GOS19 [ 2 , 12 , 44 ] , LD78 [ 34 , 37 ] , or AT464 [ 20 , 53 ] ) are members of the -C-C- family of low-molecular-weight chemokines .
This family is characterized by a similar gene organization ( three exons and two introns ) and similar protein structures ( 5 , 22 , 30 , 32 , 38 , 48 ) .
In partic-ular , each member has four conserved cysteine residues located in almost identical locations in the primary amino acid sequence .
In keeping with other members of the family , MIP-1 « /GOS19 has proinflammatory properties and has been shown to activate mast cells and basophils , to be chemotactic for T cells and monocytes , and to induce an oxidative burst in neutrophils ( 1 , 10 , 21 , 39 , 46 ) .
In addition to these inflammatory properties , MIP-1 « /GOS19 has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression of hematopoietic stem cells ( 3 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 43 ) , and it may be identical to the in vivo bone marrow stem cell inhibitor ( SCT ) described by Lord and his colleagues ( 25 ) .
SCI is secreted by macrophages present in normal murine bone marrow ( 24 , 26 ) .
In regenerating bone marrow , little MIP-1 « /GOS19 is secreted , but macrophages secrete a stem cell stimulator ( SCS ) ( 23 ) .
Therefore , it is important to understand the switch in expression from SCI to SCS during homeostatic regulation of stem cell proliferation and to identify the mechanisms controlling the expression of MIP-1 « /GOS19 .

3110 Although the murine genome contains only one gene for MIP-1 « , there are three known human equivalent genes located on chromosome 17 , bands q11 to g21 .
Two encode functional copies of the MIP-1 « coding sequence ( GOS19.1 and GOS19.2 ) , and the third encodes a nonfunctional pseudogene which lacks the 5 ' flanking region and most of the first intron ( GOS19.3 ) ( 2 , 16 , 20 , 34 ) .
Individuals have only one copy of the GOS19.1 gene , while the GOS19.2 and GOS19.3 genes are variable in their copy number .
GOS19.1 and GOS19.2 show 94 % nucleotide sequence homology over 4 kb .
GOS19.2 , however , has a repetitive Alu sequence inserted 294 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site .
It has been shown that this Alu sequence has little or no regulatory role in transcription ( 36 ) .
Both have been shown by the reverse-transcriptase PCR method to be actively transcribed ( 34 ) , and although the secreted forms show three amino acid differences , no dissimilarity in biological activities has been shown to date ( 21 , 46 ) .
Under nondisease situations , GOSI9 is expressed and secreted by activated T cells , activated monocytes , and dendritic cells ( 29 , 47 , 52 , 54 ) .
Elevated levels of GOS19 expression and secretion in transformed B cells and in fibroblast-like cells in chronic inflammation induced by Schistosoma mansoni infection have also been reported ( 27 , 42 ) .
The cell type expression and pathways of induction of GOS19 in monocytes and T cells have been well characterized ( 15 , 28 ) .
Prior to cellular activa-tion , no GOSI9 RNA is detectable .
However , treatment of U937 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) induces high levels of GOS19 mRNA transcripts which can be detected within 2 h ( 34 ) .
Treatment of Jurkat T cells with PMA plus phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) also results in cellular activation and expression of GOSI9 mRNA ( 19 , 37 , 54 ) .
Further Vou .
15 , 1995 more , de novo protein synthesis is required for expression of GOS19 in Jurkat cells but is not required in U937 cells ( 12 ) .
These reports suggest a basic difference in the mechanisms of transcriptional activation between these two cell lines .
Functional domains of the promoter region of GOS19.7 and GOS19.2 in the Jurkat cell line and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 have been studied elsewhere ( 36 ) .
A small domain of 22 bp approximately 100 bp upstream of the transcription start site which acts as a suppressor of transcription in nonactivated Jurkat cells was defined .
Interestingly , this domain is also the binding site of positive regulatory elements and is also required for full expression upon activation of Jurkat cells .
This domain contains a 13-bp sequence motif , termed the ICK-1 element , which binds four identified nuclear factors ( ICK-1A , -B , -C , and -D ) .
At least one of these , ICK-1A , is required for suppression of transcription in nonactivated Jurkat cells .
Just upstream from the ICK-1 element , there is a consensus binding site for another transcription factor , variously termed CLEO or CK2 , which is present on several hematopoietic cytokine gene promoters ( 33 , 35 , 41 ) .
However , deletion of this sequence has been shown to have no effect on the activity of the GOS19.1/ GOS19.2 promoter in Jurkat cells in transient-transfection assays ( 36 ) .
In this communication , we show that in contrast to Jurkat cells , the region containing the ICK-1 domain does not act as a transcriptional suppressor in nonactivated U937 cells , although it is required for full expression following cellular activation with PMA and PHA .
We have identified an additional cis-acting sequence overlapping the ICK-1 target site which binds a novel transcription factor ( s ) , MIP-/ « nuclear protein ( MNP ) .
In essence , interaction of the MNP factor ( s ) with its target site is crucial for transcriptional activity of the GOS19.1 gene .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of recombinant plasmid clones .
A 992-bp fragment ( from bp -813 to +179 , relative to the transcription start site ) of the GOS19.7 gene was cloned from U937 cell DNA by using PCR ( Perkin Elmer-Cetus Gene Amp PCR System 9600 ) .
Primers were designed with BamHI sites engineered on each 5 ' end ( upstream primer BU3 TAGAGA-3 ' ] and downstream primer BU4 [ 5'-GCACCCGGGATCCCCCAC AACGAAACTCAGACTCA-3 ' ] ; Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer , PCR-MATE ) .
The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI site of plasmid pUC19 ( Gibco-BRL , Gaithersburg , Md . )
and transfected into Escherichia coli DHSa « ( Gibco-BRL ) .
The DNA sequence was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing with Sequenase version 2.0 ( U.S. Biochemicals , Cleveland , Ohio ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
This plasmid , pGSP992 , was then used for the further cloning of a set of 5 ' deletion mutants for functional assays of promoter activity and for the cloning of fragments of the promoter for mobility shift assays .
To facilitate cloning of the 5 ' deletion mutants , pGSP992 was digested with BamHI ( 5 ' end of insert ) and Xhol ( +51 ) .
The resulting 864-bp fragment ( -813 to +51 ) was isolated and cloned into the BamHI-Xhol site of pBluescript II KS* ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) and was called plasmid pGSP864 .
pGSP864 was digested with XhoI and one of the following enzymes , with cleavage sites located at the indicated positions relative to the transcription start site : SmeI ( -813 ) , Asp700i ( -645 ) , Pvull ( -368 ) , HinclI ( -265 ) , or EcoRV ( -152 ) .
The resulting fragments were directionally cloned into the SmeI-Xhol site of the pGL2-Basic vector ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene such that transcription would begin at the GOSI9.7 start site and the first ATG encountered would be that of the luciferase gene .
pGSP846 was also cut with Cfol ( -532 ) , treated with T4 DNA polymerase ( New England BioLabs , Beverly , Mass .
) , and cut with XhoI .
The resulting fragment was also cloned into the Smal-Xhol site of pGL2-Basic .
These reporter plasmids were designated as follows : pGSP-813luc , pGSP-645luc , pGSP-368luc , pGSP-265luc , pGSP-152luc , and pGSP-532luc .
pGSP-119luc , pGSP-87luc , pGSP-76luc , and pGSP-45luc were constructed by using PCR with appropriate upstream primers ( 5'-GTTGTG CAACTTAGCATGACAGCATCACTA-3 '' ' , 5'-TTAAAAATTTCCCTCCTCA CC-3 ' , 5-CTCCTCACCCCCAGATTCCATTITCC-3 ' , and 5'-CGCCAGGGCT GCCTAT-3 ' ) and a downstream primer past the XhoI site of pGSP992 ( 5'-TG AGCAGGTGACGGAATG-3 ' ) .
The resulting PCR products were cut with Xhol and cloned into the SmeI-Xhol site of pGL2-Basic .
Since PCR was used in GOSI9.1 REGULATION IN MACROPHAGES 3111 the generation of these plasmids , all were sequenced for verification as previously described .
To prepare DNA fragments for electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) , pGSP992 was cut with the following group of restriction enzymes located at the indicated positions relative to the transcription start site of GOSI9.1 : BamHI ( -813 ) -45p700i ( -645 ) , Asp700i-CfoI ( -532 ) , Cfol-Pvull ( -368 ) , Pvull-Hincll ( -265 ) , Hincll-EcoRV ( -152 ) , or EcoRV-Alul ( -18 ) .
pGSP992 was also cut with Alul alone to enable isolation of a 196-bp fragment from -17 to +179 .
The digests which included Cfol were treated with T4 DNA polymerase to create blunt ends .
The GOSI9.1 promoter fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 2 % low-melting-point agarose or 10 % polyacrylamide and eluted .
BemHI linkers ( Gibco-BRL ) were ligated on each end with T4 DNA ligase ( New England BioLabs ) , cut with BamHI , ligated into the BamHI site of the pUC19 plasmid , and transformed into £ .
colf DHSa .
The resulting plasmids were designated as follows : pGSP-813/-646 , pGSP-645/-533 , pGSP-532/-369 , pGSP-368/-266 , pGSP-265/-153 , pGSP-152/-18 , and pGSP-17/+179 .
Cell culture and transfections .
The human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 ( 45 ) , the human fibroblast cell line HeLa $ 3 , the human monocytic cell line THP-1 , the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 , and the human chronic myelogenous leukemic cell line K-562 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , Md . ) .
The human leukemic cell line Jurkat was obtained from The Ohio State University cell line depository .
Raji , an Epstein-Barr virus-positive ( EBV * ) Burkitt 's lymphoma B-cell line , and BJAB , an EBV~ B-cell line , are regularly cultured in our laboratory .
All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco-BRL ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Intergen Company , Purchase , N.Y. ) .
Cells were grown logarithmically to a density of 8 x 10° cells per ml .
For transfection of U937 and Jurkat cells , pools of 36 x 10° cells were washed twice with OptiMEM reduced-serum medium ( Gibco-BRL ) and split into 12 equal parts , each part containing 3 X 10° cells in 800 pl .
These were seeded into 35-mm cell culture wells .
For U937 cells , each well was transfected with 0.75 pmol of one of the GOS19.1 promoter deletion-luciferase plasmids by using 15 pl of Lipofectin reagent ( Gibco-BRL ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
As a negative control , one set of cells was transfected with pGL2-Basic ( pro-moterless luciferase plasmid ; Promega ) .
As a positive control , another set of cells was transfected with pGL2-Control ( Promega ) , in which the luciferase gene is under the control of the simian virus 40 carly promoter .
Initially , transfection efficiencies were normalized by cotransfection with 1 mg of pCH110 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif. ) , a simian virus 40 early promoter-B-galactosidase plasmid .
The cells were gently rocked and incubated for 9 h at 37°C .
Four milliliters of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum was added to each well , and the cells were incubated for an additional 32 h. At that time , each was split , one-half was treated with PMA ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo . )
at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml and PHA ( Sigma ) at a final concentration of 1 pg/ml , and the other half was left untreated .
The cells were incubated with gentle rocking for an additional 8 h and harvested .
Transfections were repeated with two different DNA preparations three times .
Jurkat cells were transfected and treated in the same manner , with the following changes .
Twelve microliters of Lipofectamin® ( Gibco-BRL ) was used according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Initial incubation before the addition of medium was for 5 h. Cells were then incubated for 7 h , treated with PHA and PMA , and incubated for an additional 8 h before harvesting .
Luciferase assay .
Harvested cells were lysed by using the Promega luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
The lysate was centri-fuged , and 10 pul of the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity , which was measured in light units with a Berthold ( Nashua , N.H. ) Lumat 9501 luminometer with a 100-pll injector ( 6 , 40 , 51 ) .
Light units after normalizing for total protein were expressed as a percentage of the activity of the full-length wild-type ( wt ) promoter ( pGSP-813luc ) .
Nuclear extracts and EMSA .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from various cell lines and brain tissue , essentially according to the method described by Dignam et al .
( 7 ) .
For U937 nuclear extracts only , the following modifications were made .
The low-salt buffer contained 0.1 M KCI , and the high-salt buffer contained 1 M KCI , thus preventing a sudden high change in salt concentration and lysis of the nuclei .
All extracts were dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES ( N-2-hydroxyeth-ylpiperazine-NV'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ; pH 7.9 ) at 4°C , 20 % glycerol , 100 mM KCI , 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4°C , frozen in aliquots in an ethanol-dry ice bath , and stored at -80°C .
U1240 , U1242 ( two glioblastoma cell lines ) , NIH 3T3 , and human brain nuclear extracts were a kind gift from Subir Ray and Maqsood Chotani ( The Ohio State University , Columbus ) .
An SP1 consensus sequence oligonucleotide ( Promega ) was used to confirm the activity of nuclear proteins in all nuclear extracts .
For EMSA analysis , appropriate plasmids were digested with BamHI and the fragments were isolated .
After dephosphorylation with shrimp alkaline phos-phatase ( U.S. Biochemicals ) , the fragments were end labeled with [ y- '' °P|ATP ( DuPont NEN , Boston , Mass . )
by using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England BioLabs ) .
Binding reactions were performed with a mixture containing 25 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) , 10 % glycerol , 50 mM KCI , 1.5 mM dithiothreitol , and 0.1 mM EDTA for 20 min at room temperature .
In a 20-pl reaction mixture , 5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) and 15 ug of crude nuclear extract were used .
The mixture was kept on ice until the addition of 25,000 cpm ( approximately 1 ng unless otherwise noted ) of probe .
In competition experiments , unlabeled competitor was added 3112 RITTER ET AL .

After incubation , the samples were electrophoresed on either 5 or 6 % polyacrylamide ( acrylamide-bisacrylamide [ 29:1 ] ) , and the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography .
Methylation interference analysis .
Mcthylation interference analysis was performed as previously described ( 50 ) .
5'-End-labeled single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed to cold complementary oligonucleotides and were methylated with dimethyl sulfate ( Aldrich Chemical Company , Inc. , Mil-waukee , Wis. ) .
The binding reaction was performed as described above for EMSA with 200,000 cpm of end-labeled probe , 8 pg of dI-dC , and 60 ug of crude nuclear extract .
The complexes and free probe were separated on 5 % polyacryl-amide , the appropriate bands were cut out , and the DNA was electrocluted .
After precipitation , the DNA from each band was cleaved with piperidine ( Sig-ma ) .
The cleaved upper strand was electrophoresed on a 12 % polyacrylamide ( acrylamide-bisacrylamide [ 19:1 ] ) sequencing gel , and the lower strand was electrophoresed on a 20 % gel .
The resulting G tracts were visualized by autoradiography .
Mutation construction and insertion into the full-length promoter .
Two 62-bp oligonucleotide fragments were synthesized as previously described .
Each contained transvertional mutations in only the four upstream contact points of the MNP-1 complex as identified by methylation interference ( 62M1U [ 5'-TCCT GAGCCCCTGTGGTCACCAGGGACCCTGAGTTTTTAAAATTAGCA TGACAGCATCACTA-3 ' ] and 62M1L [ 5-TAGTGATGCTGTCATGCTAA TTTTAAAAACTCAGGGTCCCTGGTGACCACAGGGGCTCAGGA-3J ) .
For EMSA analysis , one of these oligonucleotides was end labeled and annealed to the cold complementary strand as previously described .

The oligonucleotide 62M1U was used as the upstream primer in conjunction with BU4 as the downstream primer in a PCR with plasmid pGSP992 as the template .
In a separate reaction , BU3 was used as the upstream primer in conjunction with 62M1L as the downstream primer , again with pGSP992 as the template .
The two resulting PCR products ( 341 and 735 bp , respectively ) were band isolated and phosphorylated with ATP ( Sigma ) as described previously .
Then , 10-ng amounts of each of these PCR products were used together as the template in a PCR , in the absence of any primers .
After five cycles of PCR , 400 ng of both BU3 and BU4 was added to the reaction mixture , and the PCR was continued for 25 more cycles .
The resulting 1,018-bp product was cleaved with Smal and Xhol , band isolated and directionally cloned into the SmeI-Xhol sites of the pGL2-Basic vector , and transfected into £ .
coli STBL2 ( Gibco-BRL ) .
This plasmid , pGSP-813M1luc , was sequenced as described for verification .
pGSP-813M1luc was subsequently used in transfections and functional assays as described above .
RESULTS Promoter activity in T cells and macrophages .
Functional studies of the GOS19.1 promoter were carried out by transient-transfection assays with Jurkat and U937 cells .
Jurkat cells can be activated with PHA and PMA , and U937 cells can be induced to differentiate into macrophages with PMA treatment .
The set of sequential 5'-terminal deletions shown in Fig .
1A were fused to a luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected into Jurkat and U937 cells .
Since it has been shown that Vou .
15 , 1995 some cell lines transport luciferase out of the cell after a variable amount of time , both transfection and incubation times had to be predetermined for each cell line ( 31 ) .
After the predetermined incubation time , the transfected cultures were split into 2 equal parts .
One half was treated with PHA and PMA , and the other half was left untreated .
After another 8 h , the cultures were harvested , cellular extracts were prepared , and the promoter activity for each set of transfections was determined and expressed as percent light units compared with the full-length wt promoter pGSP-813luc ( Fig .
1B and C ) .
The simian virus 40 early promoter is known to be responsive to phorbol esters ( 49 ) .
As thus expected , pGL-2Control ( the simian virus 40-positive control plasmid ) had activity in both cell lines and was induced to a higher level of expression after cellular activation .
The promoterless negative control plasmid , pGL-2Basic , showed only background activity in both cell lines , with or without activation .
In both Jurkat cells and U937 cells , there was very little activity from the full-length GOS19.1 promoter ( pGSP-813luc ) in nonactivated cells , but a considerable induction of expression was obtained upon cellular activation .
In nonactivated Jurkat cells , sequential deletion of the promoter to position -119 relative to the transcription start site had very little effect on activity .
However , deletion of the sequence which contains the ICK-1 element ( pGSP-87luc ) between -119 and -87 ( Fig .
1D ) resulted in a substantial increase in the percentage of relative light units .
These results further extend and confirm the previous findings of Nomiyama et al .
( 36 ) who , using 3 ' deletion mutants , have shown that a negative regulatory factor , which is active in Jurkat cells , binds to the ICK-1 element .
In nonactivated U937 cells , sequential deletion of the pro-moter , including the region between positions -119 and -87 , had little effect on the low level of promoter activity ( Fig .
1C ) .
Therefore , it appears that there is no suppressor activity associated with the region containing the ICK-1 element in these cells .
In activated U937 cells , two regions appear to be important for full promoter activity .
Deletion of the region between positions -265 and -152 ( pGSP-152luc ) and the region between -119 and -87 ( pGSP-87luc ) both caused a marked reduction in the percentage of relative light units .
The region between these two domains ( -152 to -119 ) contains the putative CLEO/CK2 binding site ( Fig .
1D ) , which is apparently not required for full promoter activity in transient-expression assays .
The focus of this communication is the domain located in the 32 bp between -119 and -87 containing the ICK-1 sequence , which is essential for transcription ( Fig .
1D ) .
Analysis of DNA-binding proteins by EMSA .
Extracts of nuclear proteins were prepared from Jurkat and U937 cells .
The 135-bp fragment containing the ICK-1 element and the putative CLEO/CK2 site was excised from pGSP-152/-18 plasmid DNA , gel purified , end labeled , and used as a probe to detect sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins by EMSA analysis .
Figure 2 , lanes 1 to 5 , shows the presence of several shifted labeled complexes using Jurkat ( lane 2 ) and U937 ( lane 4 ) nuclear extracts , which were shown to be specific by com-petion with an excess of unlabeled self DNA ( lanes 3 and 5 ) .
( No difference was seen by using nuclear extracts from activated or nonactivated cells [ data not shown ] . )
Most impor-tantly , fast-migrating complexes were obtained by using U937 and Jurkat nuclear extracts .
These same bands were seen when extracted proteins were bound to a 91-bp fragment located between -119 and -29 ( Fig .
2 , lanes 6 to 10 ) and also to a 62-bp fragment located between -151 and -90 ( Fig .
2 , lanes 11 to 15 ) .
These results suggested that the faster-migrating complexes were due to the binding of nuclear proteins at a site defined by the overlap between the 62-bp fragment and the GOSI9.1 REGULATION IN MACROPHAGES 3113 135bp 91bp 62bp _s -a s - & Jurkat + - - FP -m Jurkat - @ Jurkat + - » U937 - an U937 + - & FP -~ Jurkat - o Jurkat + - « © U937 -3 U937 + - 2 FP ~ rm Jurkat -_ U937 - m U937 + \~ \ ¥ E 8 \ ld “ o s » A.

EMSA of overlapping 135-bp ( lanes 1 to 5 ) , 91-bp ( lanes 6 to 10 ) , and 62-bp ( lanes 11 to 15 ) fragments .

The U937-specific MNP-1 complexes formed with each probe are indicated by arrows .
The Jurkat cell-specific MNP-2 complexes formed with each probe are indicated by arrowheads .
By using the 91-bp probe , the MNP-2 complex was faint , probably because the binding site is quite near the 5 ' end of this sequence .
91-bp fragment , i.e. , in a 30-bp sequence located between -119 and -90 containing the ICK-1 element .
The faster-migrating Jurkat cell complex was faint with the 91-bp probe , which was subsequently found to be caused by the fact that the binding site for this factor is quite near the 5 ' end of this probe .
We synthesized a 30-bp double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to this sequence and used it in EMSA .
The fast-migrating complexes formed poorly with this fragment , and we assume that binding of the protein factor ( s ) to this site requires a larger stretch of DNA ( data not shown ) .
For this reason , all further experiments were carried out with the larger 62-bp DNA probe .
As seen in Fig .
3 , at least four complexes were identified which are due to binding of the ICK-1A , -B , and -C factors and the CLEO/CK2 factor ( complexes 3 , 4 , 6 , and 5 , respectively ) .
This was determined by competition with a 30-bp oligonucleotide containing the ICK-1 element ( lane 5 ) and with a double-stranded oligonucleotide defining the CLEO/ CK2 sequence from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene promoter ( 41 ) ( lane 6 ) .
In our hands , nuclear extracts often fail to form the most slowly migrating ICK-1 complex ( ICK-1D ) .
Titration of cold competitor showed that the U937 and Jurkat unique fast-migrating complexes ( complexes 1 and 2 ) were very sequence specific .
As little as a S-fold molar excess of cold fragment was sufficient to cause competition of these complexes with the labeled probe ( data not shown ) , in contrast to ICK-1A , which required a 30- to 3114 RITTER ET AL .

EMSA of 62-bp fragment and competition identification of DNA-protein complexes .
EMSA were performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Complexes were inhibited with a 50-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide representing the 30-bp overlap region -119 to -90 , which includes the ICK-1 element ( lane 5 ) and an oligonucleotide containing the CLEON/CK2 site from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoter ( lane 6 ) .
Identified complexes : MNP-2 ( 1 ) , MNP-1 ( 2 ) , ICK-1A ( 3 ) , ICK-1B ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ICK-1C ( 6 ) .
FP , free probe .
50-fold molar excess of competitor to achieve the same level of competition .
Nomiyama et al .
( 36 ) have shown that ICK-1A has a low binding affinity for the ICK-1 element .
Consensus binding site double-stranded oligonucleotides for 12 known transcription factors , SP1 , NF1/CTF , AP1 , AP2 , AP3 , NF- « B , GRE , CREB , OCT-1 , PU.1 , SRE , and CLEON/CK2 ( 11 , 18 ) , were used as cold competitors at a 100-fold molar ex-cess .
None could compete with the probe for binding of the faster complexes ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we propose to call these complexes MNP ( U937 cells ) and MNP ( Jurkat cells ) .
Contact point analysis .
To determine the nucleotide contact points for MNP-1 , we carried out methylation interference analysis with the 62-bp fragment ( -151 to -90 ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
MNP-1 made several contact points with G residues over a 17-bp region from -113 to -97 .
Methylation of G residues at -113 , =111 , and -99 on the upper strand ( Fig .
4A , lane 2 ) and at -110 , -107 , and -97 on the lower strand ( Fig .
4B , lane 2 ) significantly interfered with the binding of MNP-1 to the probe .
The binding sites in the region -113 to -107 are outside the contact points for ICK-1A , which makes contacts with G residues at -103 , -99 , and -95 on the upper strand and -102 , -97 , and -94 on the lower strand ( Fig .
4C ) ( 36 ) .
Thus , contact points at -99 ( upper strand ) and -97 ( lower strand ) are shared by MNP ICK-1A , and ICK-1B .
Neither ICK-1C nor ICK-1D shares those contact points .

Tissue and cell type expression and mutational analysis of MNP complexes .
By using site-directed mutagenesis , a 62-bp double-stranded DNA fragment in which the four upstream contact points for MNP-1 ( G residues ) were changed to T residues was constructed ( 62M1 ; Fig .
4C ) .
In order to determine the tissue and cell type expression of MNP complexes , the 62-bp double-stranded wild-type oligonucleotide ( 62 wt ) and 62M1 were end labeled and allowed to form complexes with nuclear extracts from U937 , THP-1 , Raji , BJAB , Jurkat , and K562 cells .
Shifted complexes were analyzed by EMSA , and the results are shown in Fig .
5A .
U937 ( lane 3 ) , THP-1 ( lane 5 ) , Raji ( lane 7 ) , and BJAB ( lane 9 ) extracts showed the presence of the distinctive MNP-1 complex with the probe 62wt .
The binding of MNP-1 in these nuclear extracts was abrogated by the presence of the M1 mutation ( lanes 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 , respectively ) .
Jurkat cell ( lane 11 ) nuclear extracts showed the presence of the MNP-2 complex with the probe 62wt , and binding was also abrogated by the presence of the M1 mutation ( lane 12 ) .
K562 nuclear extracts showed only a very faint MNP-2 complex ( lanes 13 and 14 ) .
In lanes 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , and 19 , it can be seen that neither MNP-1 nor MNP could be detected in brain ( lane 15 ) , U1240 ( lane 16 ) , U1242 ( lane 17 ) , NIH 3T3 ( lane 18 ) , and F9 ( lane 19 ) cell nuclear extracts .
In addition , in Fig .
3 , lane 2 , neither MNP-1 nor MNP-2 is detected in HeLa $ 3 nuclear extracts When the 62M1 mutant probe was used with these nuclear extracts ( brain , U1240 , U1242 , NIH 3T3 , F9 , and HeLa $ 3 cell nuclear extracts ) , the same pattern of bands was obtained as that observed with the probe 62wt , thus confirming the lack of MNP-1 and MNP-2 ( data not shown ) .
Figure 5B shows an EMSA with the SP1 consensus sequence oligonucleotide as a probe with these nuclear extracts to show that all were active for nuclear DNA-binding proteins .
The MIL mutation was introduced into the full-length GOS19.1 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene .
The mutant pGSP-813M1luc and wt pGSP-813luc constructs were then used to transiently transfect U937 and Jurkat cells .
These transfected cultures were subsequently treated with PHA and PMA as previously described .
The results were normalized for total protein and expressed as percent relative light units compared with the full-length wt promoter pGSP-813luc ( Fig .
6A and B ) .
The M1 mutation completely abolished the activity of the promoter in both noninduced and induced U937 cells ( Fig .
6A ) .
In Jurkat cells , the promoter activity was markedly reduced by a factor of 4 but was not abolished ( Fig .
6B ) .
DISCUSSION Previous work has shown that the GOS19.1 gene is differ-entially regulated in T cells and monocytes ( 15 , 19 , 28 , 34 , 37 , 42 , 52 , 54 ) .
A DNA sequence , termed the ICK-1 element , which is required for suppression of transcription in nonactivated Jurkat cells and also for induction of expression after cellular activation has been identified ( 36 ) .
This DNA sequence forms four distinct protein-DNA complexes when exposed to nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells .
The nuclear factors which form these complexes have been termed ICK-1A , -B , -C , and -D ( 36 ) .
Nomiyama et al .
( 36 ) have also presented evidence that at least ICK-1A is required for transcriptional suppression in Jurkat cells .
In this communication , we confirm the presence of a transcriptional silencer for noninduced Jurkat cells in the ICK-1 domain ( Fig .
1 ) .
Furthermore , we provide additional evidence for a basic difference in the regulation of the GOS19 genes in T cells and monocytes .
Unlike in Jurkat cells , there is no transcriptional suppressor activity of the ICK-1 domain in nonactivated U937 cells ( monocytes in Fig .
1C ) , although this domain is still required for full expression after cellular activation .
Thus , the underlying mechanisms for the lack of expression in nonactivated T cells and monocytes appear to be different .
Using EMSA , we investigated the protein-DNA complexes formed from nuclear extracts of Jurkat , U937 , and HeLa $ 3 cells .
The DNA probes that were used overlapped in a 30-bp sequence ( -119 to -90 ) which was slightly larger than the defined ICK-1 sequence .

Transient expression of the full-length GQSI9.1 promoter containing the M1 mutation .
The M1 mutation was introduced into the full-length GOS19.1 promoter and linked to the luciferase reporter in the pGL-2Basic vector ( pGSP-813M1luc ) .
The wt construct ( pGSP-813luc ) and the mutant construct ( pGSP-813M1luc ) were individually transfected into U937 cells ( A ) or into Jurkat cells ( B ) to compare promoter activities with and without the presence of the mutation .
Results of luciferase assays are expressed as percent activity relative to the full-length wt promoter pGSP-813luc after normalization for total protein .
Black bars , results from nonstimulated cells ; striped bars , results after stimulation with PHA and PMA for 8 h. complexes corresponding to ICK-1A , -B , and -C were identified ( Fig .
2 ) .
We did not routinely observe ICK-1D complexes under our binding conditions .
It has previously been reported that this complex is very sensitive to the amount and composition of nonspecific competitor DNA used in binding assays ( 36 ) .
In addition , a complex corresponding to an upstream CLEO/CK2 site was identified .
Our deletion experiments show that this binding site has no effect on promoter activity in either Jurkat or U937 cells ( Fig .
1B and C ) , at least in transient-transfection assays .
By using U937 , THP Raji , BJAB , Jurkat , and KS562 nuclear extracts , two additional faster-migrating complexes , which we have termed MNP-1 and MNP-2 , were observed .
Competition experiments show that these complexes are much more specific than ICK-1A , -B , or -C. It should be noted that no differences were observed in the pattern of complex formation whether nuclear extracts were prepared from nonactivated or activated cells .
We interpret this to mean that whatever the roles of the nuclear factors in suppression of transcription and full expression , the activation must involve modulation of existing proteins and/or the interaction with additional nuclear factors .

The MNP factor ( s ) makes contact with G residues in the 30-bp domain over a 17-bp region ( Fig .
4C ) .
Interestingly , four contact points ( two on each strand ) between positions -113 and -107 are completely outside the G residue contact points reported for ICK-1A , -B , -C , and -D ( Fig .
4C ) ( 36 ) .
Furthermore , the two G residue contact points which overlap with the ICK-1 element , at -99 ( upper strand ) and -97 ( lower strand ) , are shared by ICK-1A and -B .
These results strongly suggest a second cis-acting element located upstream of and overlapping the ICK-1 element , which we propose to term the MNP site .
ICK-1 sites have also been identified in the promoters of the interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor genes .
However , these sequences do not contain the upstream sequence which defines the MNP site .
With unlabeled synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to these other ICK-1 sites , competition with the ICK-1A , -B , and -C complexes ( at a rather high molar excess of competitor ) but not the MNP complexes was possible ( data not shown ) .
This further suggests that the MNP complex ( es ) is a distinct nuclear binding factor ( s ) .
The complex nature of the protein-DNA interactions surrounding the ICK-1 and MNP sites suggests the possibility of competition for binding for different factors and possibly cooperative binding .
The MNP factor ( s ) appears to have a higher affinity than any of the ICK-1 factors , and in the presence of the M1 mutation which abrogates the formation of the MNP complexes , the binding abilities of the ICK-1 factors are changed variably .
One attractive possible explanation is that in the presence of an MNP factor ( s ) , either or both of the ICK-1A or -B factors may not be able to bind to the ICK-1 site in vivo .
It remains to be determined whether this model has any validity for the difference in transcriptional regulation at this domain between Jurkat and U937 cells .
Using nuclear extracts from a wide variety of cell types , we found that the MNP complex was formed with U937 , THP-1 , Raji , and BJAB nuclear extracts , while a strong MNP complex was formed with Jurkat cell nuclear extracts .
The M1 mutation at the MNP site completely abolished the ability of the DNA to form either the MNP-1 or the MNP-2 complex .
At this time , we do not know whether the MNP complexes are formed from the same protein ( s ) or from a family of related proteins .
The M1 mutation completely abolished the activity of the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells , suggesting that interaction of the MNP factor ( s ) with its cis-acting binding site is necessary for promoter function in this cell type .
However , although the activity was reduced by fourfold in Jurkat cells , it was not completely abolished .
This further emphasizes the difference in regulation of GOS19.1 transcription in the two cell types .
Previous work by others ( 36 ) has shown that the ICK-1 site alone had little effect on the activity of the thymi-dine kinase promoter .
It would be of interest to investigate the MNP site alone in this way .
However , to date we have been unable to inactivate the ICK-1 site without also inactivating the MNP site .
Analysis of transcription factor recognition sequence data bases failed to reveal an identifiable match for the MNP target sequence .
We propose that we have identified a novel transcription factor , or family of factors , which is expressed in some hematopoietic cells , but not fibroblasts , epithelial cells , brain tissue , glioblastoma cells , or embryonal carcinoma cells .
We believe we have shown here that the MNP factor ( s ) is crucial for the transcription regulation of the GOS19.1 gene in T cells and macrophages .
