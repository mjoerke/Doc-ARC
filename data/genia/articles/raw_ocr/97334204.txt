Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is one such cytokine , whose increased expression results mostly from increases in transcription .
Cis-acting elements with NFxB , API and ETS-like binding motifs have been identified in the promoter region of the GM-CSF gene , and are important or essential for transcriptional activity following T cell activation .
ETS1 is a transcription factor of the ETS family that is expressed in T cells .
We have previously shown that ETS1 can transactivate GM-CSF in Jurkat T cells , but only after the cells have been stimulated by treatment with PMA and ionomycin , agents that mimic T cell activation .
Thus we proposed that ETS1 , which is expressed constitutively in Jurkat cells , may act in concert with PMA ionomycin inducible factors .
Here we show that ETS1 can transactivate a GM-CSF reporter construct in unstimulated Jurkat cells , providing that either NFxB or API transcription factors are supplied by co-transfection .
We confirm that binding of endogenous NFxB and API is induced following PMA/ionomycin treatment of T cells .
Transactivation by ETS1 , NFxB and API is synergistic , and mutation of the individual binding sites reveals that the transcriptional activities of these factors are inter-dependent .
Our results suggest that constitutive ETS1 , and inducible NFxB and API , cooperate as part of a higher order transcriptional complex in activated T cells .
Keywords : GM-CSF ; Transcription ; ETSl ; NFkB ; API Introduction Helper T cells are activated , and initiate an immune response , through recognition of specific antigens presented by antigen presenting cells .
Activation is primarily mediated through the T cell receptor , which enhances intracellular calcium levels and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity ( Miyajima et al. , 1988 ; Valge et al. , 1988 ; Klausner and Samelson , 1991 ) .
These events can be mimicked in culture by addition of the calcium ionophore , ionomycin and the protein kinase C activator , PMA ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) .
Correspondence : I Kola Received 31 October 1996 ; revised 28 February 1997 ; accepted 28 February 1997 Activating signals ultimately result in cellular prolifera-tion , and transcriptional induction and secretion of a number of cytokines including IL-2 ( interleukin-2 ) , IL-3 , IFNy ( interferon-gamma ) and GM-CSF ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) ( Stanley et al. , 1985 ; Miyajima et al. , 1988 ; Arai et al. , 1990 ) .
These cytokines direct the effector functions of various cell types involved in an immune response , including B cells , macrophages , mast cells , eosinophils and neutrophils .
GM-CSF expression in activated T cells is regulated by two mechanisms .
Firstly , GM-CSF transcription is controlled by both constitutive and inducible transcription factors that interact with the proximal promoter ( Sugimoto et al. , 1990 ; Koyano-Nakagawa et al. , 1993 ; Masuda et al. , 1993 ; Ye et al. , 1996 ) and a distal enhancer shared by GM-CSF and IL-3 ( Cockerill et al. , 1995 ; Osborne et al. , 1995 ) .
Secondly , GM-CSF mRNA stability is controlled through an AU rich 3 ' region ( Shaw and Kamen , 1986 ; Iwai et al. , 1993 ) , although the importance of this mechanism has been questioned ( Brorson et al. , 1991 ) .
Essential elements in the proximal promoter ( Figure 1 ) include the CLE2 ( conserved lymphokine element ) /GC-box region , which supports the binding of inducible NFxB/Rel and constitutive Spl family members , and CLEO , which binds inducible API and constitutive ETS factors .
An inducible NFAT-like complex ( Masuda et al. , 1993 ) also displays weak binding to CLEO .
The CLEO region has been described as a part of a triple repeat CATT ( A/T ) element by others ( Nimer et al. , 1990 ) .
In addition , other factors have recently been shown to be involved in GM-CSF transcriptional control .
CBF ( Core Binding Factor ) ( Takahashi et al. , 1995 ; Cockerill et al. , 1996 ) and YYI ( Yin-Yang 1 ) ( Ye et al. , 1994 , 1996 ) appear to exert positive and negative effects , respectively , upon GM CSF transcription .
These two factors bind a region between the CLE2 and CLEO elements .
Previously we have characterised the binding of ETSl and other ETS family members , to the ETS binding site within the CLEO element of the GM-CSF promoter ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) .
Our experiments suggested that ETS1l plays an important role in GM-CSF transcription following PMA and ionomycin stimulation , and hence in T cell activation .
However , we found that ETS1l binding appeared to be constitutive , and that ETS1 could not transactivate GM-CSF unless the T cells were first treated with PMA and ionomycin .
These results suggest that : ( 1 ) ETSl does not instigate GM-CSF transcription and ; ( 2 ) either ETSl is modified by PMA/ionomycin treatment or other factors induced by PMA/ionomy- Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al 2846 `` 600 600bp Human GM-CSF Promoter H CAT | -- pGM600 CLE2 GC-box CLEO TATA « 90 -80 -10 -60 -40 -30 -20 10 p > TfCAGST ABT TEJECCGCE NCCC TTETEGTCACGAT TAATCATT Tce TG GTGT AGCTCTTTTGCCAGTGAGCCCACGTACA Ab recA TCGAGAAAACGGTCACTCGGGTGCATET -v- -y -- - , -- NFkB Sp-1 CBEVY1 _ APA ETS AGAGGAAAT .- GMEts AGAAGAMAT .- GMETSm er nnn pGM600-ETSm1 - ames AGCGGAAGC .- MSV ( ETS consensus ) @ ETTAACT - GMeBm nnn rev pGM600-Bm1 GGGGACTT .- NFKB consensus Traitck - gmari GATAGCA |- GMAPIm sorce pGM600-AP1m1 TGAGTCA -- API consensus Figure 1 - Structure of the GM-CSF promoter , CAT constructs and oligonucleotide sequences .
The 600 bp human GM-CSF promoter contains a transcriptional control region of approximately 100 bp proximal to transcriptional initiation ( arrow ) .
This region contains elements conserved among the promoters of genes expressed following T cell activation .
The CLE2 ( conserved lymphokine element ) /GC-box region contains binding sites for the NFxB and Spl families of transcription factors .
CLEO contains binding sites for API and ETS families .
Other elements include a consensus TATA box , and binding regions for CBF ( core binding factor ) and YY1 .
The sequences of oligonucleotides spanning the NFxB , API1 and ETS sites and their mutations are shown .
Consensus binding site sequences are also shown .
pGM600 is a CAT construct driven by the 600 bp wild-type GM-CSF promoter .
Mutant binding sites have been introduced into the pGM600-ETS1 , -xB and -AP1 constructs , as indicated cin are required .
In this study we characterise requirements for ETS1 transactivation .
We show that ETSl can transactivate a GM-CSF reporter construct in unstimulated Jurkat cells , providing that either or both NFxB and API transcription factors are supplied exogenously .
We confirm previous studies that show binding of endogenous NFB and API is inducible following PMA/ionomycin treatment of T cells .
Transactivation by ETS1l , NFxB and API is synergistic , and mutation of the individual binding sites reveals that the transcriptional activities of these factors are inter-dependent .
Our results suggest that NFxB and API may be additional co-factors required for ETSl mediated transactivation , and that these three factors operate synergistically as part of a higher order transcriptional complex in activated T cells .
Results ETSI transactivation requires PMA and ionomycin stimulation or additional NFB and/or API factors A CAT reporter construct containing 600 bp of the human GM-CSF promoter ( pGM600 ) ( Figure 1 ) was transiently transfected into Jurkat cells , and the effects of co-transfected expression constructs and treatment of the cells with PMA and ionomycin were analysed ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ) .
The raw CAT data for pGM600 , with the various treatment/co-transfections , was normalised to its basal expression , which was given the value of 'one ' .
The mean of at least four replicates for each experiment was graphed to show a 'fold induction over basal pGM600 expression , to facilitate comparison between the different treatments/co-transfections .
Co-transfection of an ETSl expression construct resulted in fourfold transactivation of the GM-CSF reporter , but only if the cells were first treated with PMA and ionomycin .
Potentially , PMA/ionomycin either modifies the ETS1 protein or supplies co-factors required for ETS1l transactivation .
Because the GM CSF promoter contains binding sites for other transcription factors in close proximity to that of ETSl ( Figure 1 ) , we examined transcriptional interactivity between ETSl , NFxB and API1 factors .
Transfection of NFxB ( p50 and p65 ) and API ( c-Fos and c-Jun ) resulted in 18- and ninefold transactivation , respectively , in unstimulated Jurkat cells ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ) .
Although ETS1l alone could not produce transactivation in unstimulated cells , co-transfection of ETSl with NFxB or API resulted in strong synergistic transactivation .
ETS1 and NFxB together resulted in increased GM-CSF transcription 123-fold higher than basal expression - sevenfold higher than NFB alone .
ETSl and API resulted in a 34-fold increase , which was fourfold higher than API alone .
NFxB and API together were also strongly synergistic , resulting in a 308-fold increase in transcription compared with basal expression .
Maximal synergistic transactivation was achieved with all three transcription factors , resulting in a 820-fold increase over basal expression .
In this experiment , addition of ETSl resulted in a 2.5-fold increase compared to just NFxB/API .
Thus , transactivation by ETS1 was possible in PMA/ionomycin treated cells or in unstimulated cells supplemented with exogenous NFxB and/or API transcription factors , suggesting that these may be PMA /ionomycin induced co-factors required for ETSI function .
Consequently , we have examined whether DNA binding to ETS , NFB and API sites in the proximal GM-CSF promoter ( Figure 1 ) is increased upon stimulation of Jurkat cells In addition , we wished to identify the NFxB and API factors which may synergise with ETS1l in vivo .
ETSI binds the GM-CSF promoter constitutively EMSA ( electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) analysis showed that a number of proteins in Jurkat nuclear lysates bound to the GMETS sequence contained within CLEO , -35 to -44 of the GM-CSF promoter ( Figure 3 - lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The complex labeled n/s appeared to represent a non-specific DNA binding protein capable of binding any oligonucleotide sequence .
The complexes A , B and C were competed by an excess of a consensus ETS binding site ( MSV ) ( lane 3 ) and by GMETS ( lane 4 ) .
A mutant GMETS sequence ( GMETSm1l ) , which contains a point mutation in the core of the ETS binding site , was unable to compete for binding of these complexes ( lane 5 ) , and did not display binding to them when labeled and used as a probe ( lane 7 ) .
Thus , all complexes display characteristics consistent with DNA binding proteins of the ETS family .
Complex C was identified as ETS1l by its specific removal with addition of an ETS1 antibody ( lane 6 ) and the just visible appearance of a supershift ( identified by the open arrow ) .
The identity of complexes A and B have not yet been determined , but could represent binding of other ETS family members expressed in T cells such as ETS2 , GABP « and/or FLIl .
Binding of another complex , above that of complex A , was also faintly visible ( small arrow ) .
Previously we have identified this complex as Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al Fold Treatment !

Protein samples were Jurkat ( Jur ) cell nuclear lysates , either untreated ( - ) or PMA/ionomycin treated ( P+1 ) .

An open arrow identifies a super-shifted ETS1 complex in lane 6 .
A small arrow indicates ELFI1 binding in lane 2 ELF ] ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) , but can not consistently detect it due to the low level of binding .
The ETS-like complexes ( A , B and C ) displayed strong binding to the GMETS site .
Nuclear lysates from Jurkat cells treated for 4 h with PMA and ionomycin displayed little difference in the qualitative or quantitative binding of these complexes ( compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The cells were treated for 4 h with PMA/ionomycin since analysis of pGM600 induction over time suggested that the GM-CSF promoter was maximally active at this time ( data not shown ) .
In addition , activation of cells following treatment with PMA was confirmed by measurement of secreted interferon y in the media ( data not shown ) .
Hence ETSl binding ( as well as factors A and B ) appears to be constitutive over the time frame of the experiment .
This data supports the hypothesis that , although PMA/ionomycin treatment of T cells provides conditions under which ETS1l can transactivate GM-CSF , PMA/ionomycin provides required ETS1l co-factors , rather than directing any modification of ETSl that might increase its binding affinity .
NFxB p65/p50 and p50/p50 complexes bind the GM CSF promoter following PMA and ionomycin stimulation Two NFxB-like complexes in stimulated Jurkat nuclear lysates ( complex A and B ) bound the GMxB site contained within the CLE2/GC-box region , -77 to -85 of the GM-CSF promoter ( Figure 4a - lane 3 ) .
Both complexes were competed by an excess of a consensus NFxB sequence ( lane 4 ) and by the GMxB oligonucleotide ( lane 5 ) , but not by mutant GMxB ( GMxBm1 ) ( lane 6 ) .
Additionally , labeled GMxBml did not bind these complexes when used as the probe ( lane 8 ) .
The consensus NFxB probe bound most strongly to a complex in stimulated lysates that approximately co-migrated with complex A ( lane 10 ) , suggesting that they are equivalent .
Binding of recombinant p50 to the GMxB site was correctly identified as p50 using a panel of NFxB family antibodies ( Figure 4b - lanes 2-6 ) .
Since NFxB factors usually bind as dimers , this complex most probably represents a p50/p50 homodimer .
In Jurkat nuclear extracts these antibodies identified p50 in both complexes A and B ( lane 10 ) and p65 in complex A ( lane 11 ) , suggesting that complex A represents a p50/ p65 heterodimer , and complex B a p50/p50 homodimer .
Additionally , both recombinant p50/p50 and complex B had a similar migration rate , suggesting that they are equivalent .
It appeared that neither IxB nor c-Rel , formed part of the nuclear NFxB complexes that bound GMxB , since the binding of complexes A and B were not affected by addition of antibodies to these proteins ( lanes 8 and 9 , respectively ) .
Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al 2848 Binding of the p50/p65 and p50/p50 complexes to GMxB were not detectable in unstimulated Jurkat nuclear lysates , but were strongly induced following treatment of the cells for 4 h with PMA and ionomycin ( Figure 4a - lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The consensus NFxB sequence did however display some binding to proteins in unstimulated lysates ( lane 9 ) , probably due to its very high affinity compared to GMxB .
These complexes displayed similar but slightly faster and slower migration rates compared to the p50/p65 complex bound to GMxB , and may represent binding of unidentified NFxB family members .
API complexes containing c-Fos and c-Jun , and other fos { jun family members , bind the GM-CSF promoter following PMA and ionomycin stimulation APl-like binding to the GMAPI sequence contained within CLEO , -43 to -50 of the GM-CSF promoter , was represented by a diffuse band in Jurkat nuclear lysates ( Figure Sa - lane 2 ) .
This complex was competed by an excess of a consensus API sequence ( lane 3 ) and by the GMAPI oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) , but not by mutant GMAPI ( GMAPim ! 1l ) ( lane 5 ) .
Also , labeled GMAPIm ! 1 did not bind this complex ( lane 7 ) , but the API consensus site did ( lane 9 ) .
The AP1 consensus site appears to bind much more strongly than GMAPI , and appeared to bind additional APIl-like complexes .

The complexes that bind GMxB are labeled as complex A or p50/p65 , complex B or p50/p50 and non-specific ( n/s ) .
The open arrow indicates the position of antibody super-shifted NFxB complexes and c-Jun , expressed together in COS cells , also produced a diffuse band , in combination with API factors already present in COS nuclear lysates ( Figure 5b - lane 2 ) .
Cross-reacting antibodies to Fos ( pan-Fos : apfos ) and Jun ( pan-Jun : apjun ) family members , demonstrated that most or all of the complexes present contained Fos/Jun family components ( lanes 3 and 5 ) .
The c-Fos specific antibody appeared to remove just the top half of the band ( lane 4 ) .
c-Jun was present in both upper and lower parts of the band ( lane 6 ) .
Based on these results , it appears that binding was constituted by c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers , c-Jun/c-Jun homodimers and other Fos/Jun family complexes .
These experiments verify the fidelity of the antibodies .
In Jurkat nuclear lysates , the diffuse band appeared to contain multiple Fos/Jun family components ( lanes 8 and 10 ) .
c-Fos was predominant in the upper part of the band ( lane 9 ) and c-Jun in the lower ( lane 11 ) , although these two specific components also appeared to contribute to both upper and lower portions .
So , although c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers and c-Jun/c-Jun homodimers appeared to be present in the band , other Fos/Jun family dimers were also present .

The open arrow indicates the position of antibody super-shifted API complexes diffuse nature of the API complex could be explained by the binding of multiple Fos/Jun family dimers of similar EMSA mobilities ( Curran and Franza , 1988 ; Kerppola and Curran , 1995 ) , although the presence of multiple phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated species ( Radler-Pohl et al. , 1993 ; Woodgett et al. , 1993 ) could also contribute to the diffuse appearance of this band .
The API complexes were undetectable in unstimulated Jurkat nuclear lysates , but were induced after treatment of cells for 4 h with PMA ( Figure Sa - lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Although , using a stronger API binding site like the API consensus , API complexes were detected at lower levels in lysates from unstimulated cells ( lane 8 ) .
Similarly to NFxB binding , binding of API complexes present in unstimulated Jurkat cells to the API consensus displayed similar , but distinctly different mobilities , compared to those that bound GMAPI in unstimulated cells .
Mutations of the ETS , NFB and API binding sites reduce GM-CSF transcription in response to PMA and ionomycin , and to ETSI transactivation after PMA } ionomycin treatment To test whether the ability of ETS1l to transactivate in PMA /ionomycin stimulated cells may in fact be due to the induction of NFB and/or API factors , we have mutated the respective binding sites for these factors ( Figure 1 ) , and examined the effects upon PMA/ ionomycin mediated GM-CSF transcription , and ETS1 transactivation following PMA treatment .
The modifications to pGM600 involve minimal point-mutations , analogous to those found in the mutant oligonucleotides GMETSm1 , GMxBm1l and Fold - Treatment/ Transfection Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al GMAPlm1l , that we have demonstrated disrupt binding of the respective factors ( Figures 3 , 4a and 5b ) .
Mutation of the ETS , NFxB or API transcription factor binding sites in pGM600 resulted in very little change to the basal level of expression , which were not statistically significant ( 1.2- , 1.5- and 1.4-fold higher than wild-type , respectively ) .
The raw CAT data for each construct ( pGM600 , pGM600-ETSm1 , pGM600-xBm1 , pGM600-APIm1 ) , with the various treatment/ co-transfections , was normalised to its own basal expression , which was given the value of 'one ' .
The mean of at least four replicates for each experiment was graphed to show a 'fold induction ' over basal expression , to facilitate comparison between the different mutations and treatment/co-transfections .
All of these mutations resulted in reduction or abolition of PMA responsiveness , suggesting that these regions of the promoter are important for GM-CSF expression in activated T cells ( Figure 6 , Table 1 ) .
Mutation of the ETS site in CLEO ( pGM600-ETSm1 ) abolished PMA/ionomycin inducibility and also ETSl transactivation following PMA treatment .
Mutation of the NFxB site in the CLE2/ GC-box and API site in CLEO ( pGM600-APim1 ) resulted in 1.4- and 1.6-fold PMA/ ionomycin induction , respectively , which were not statistically different to basal expression .
However , the mutations resulted in 35 % and 40 % of the pGM600 induction by PMA respectively .
In addition , the NFxB and mutations greatly reduced the ability of ETSl to transactivate , supporting the proposal that the PMA dependence of ETSI transactivation is in fact due to dependence on PMA/ionomycin inducible co-factors such as NFxB and API .

Other labels and procedures are as described in Figure 2 2849 Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al 2850 Synergistic cooperation between ETS , NFxB and API is reduced by mutations in their binding sites Although ETS1l activity seems to be dependent upon the presence of other factors , the ability of NFxB and API to transactivate may also be dependent on other constitutive factors , such as ETSI , that are already present in unstimulated Jurkat cells To test the interdependence of the ETSl , NFxB and API factors , and whether these factors act directly through their respective binding sites , we analysed ETS1 , NFB and API transactivation , in unstimulated Jurkat cells , with the promoter constructs containing mutations of their binding sites ( Figure 7 , Table 1 ) .
Transactivation with NFxB was reduced by approximately 90 % , from 18- to 1.9-fold , after the NFxB site has been mutated , and API transactivation ( 8.8-fold ) was abolished with an API mutation , indicating that the effect of these factors , alone , is achieved mainly through direct interaction with the promoter .
However , mutation of the ETS site reduced NFxB transactivation by 63 % , to 6.6-fold ( P=0.01 ) , and blocked API mediated transactivation completely , suggesting that exogenous NFxB and API functionally interact with endogenous factor/s in Jurkat cells that bind the ETS site .
Mutation of the ETS binding site also eliminated the ability of ETS1 to transactivate in the presence of either or both NFxB and API , indicating that ETS1l acts by binding directly to the GM-CSF promoter at this site .
The synergistic transactivation displayed by ETSIl and NFxB together ( 123-fold ) was reduced by 94 % , to 7.3-fold , by mutation of the ETS binding site , and by 97 % , to fourfold , by mutation of the NFxB binding site .
These mutations did not however completely block transactivation , possibly because there is still residual binding to the mutated sites , although this is not supported by the EMSA data ( Figures 3 - lane 7 and 4 - lane 8 ) .

Because the ETS and API binding sites are very close together in the GM-CSF promoter , the respective mutations were evaluated by EMSA , which confirmed that mutation in one binding site did not disrupt or modify binding to the other ( data not shown ) .
The strong synergy displayed by co-transfection of ETSl , NFxB and API together ( 820-fold ) was particularly dependent upon an intact API site ( reducing transactivation by 99 % , to 6.5-fold , when mutated ) , and to a lesser extent the ETS and NFxB binding sites ( reducing transactivation by 92 % , to 64-fold and 88 % , to 97-fold , respectively , upon mutation ) .
Taken together , the results from ETS NFxB and API mutations of the GM-CSF promoter suggest a high degree of transactivational interdependence between these factors .
In addition , although NFB and API appear to have some ability to operate independently , these experiments suggest that there is interactivity with endogenous ETS1l , or other ETS factors , that are expressed constitutively in unstimulated Jurkat cells ( Figure 3 ) .
Discussion Helper T cells are intimately involved in mediating immune responses to pathogens and tumours .
Recognition of antigens is followed by a process of T cell activation , which ultimately results in expression and secretion of cytokines that enhance the function of various effector cells of the immune system .
The expression of these cytokines is primarily mediated through increased transcription factor activity and subsequent transcription .
Initially , our study of GM CSF transcription in T cells ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) suggested that ETSI , a constitutively expressed transcription factor , was required for GM-CSF transcription following T cell activation .
However , we observed that this factor could only transactivate GM-CSF in T cells that had first been activated by PMA /ionomycin treatment .
In this paper we show that ETSl can transactivate GM-CSF in unstimulated cells , provided that NFxB or API transcription factors Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al are supplied .
We confirm previous studies which demonstrate that NFxB and API factors are induced upon T cell activation , suggesting that these factors are the PMA/ionomycin induced co-factors required for ETS1 transactivation .
In addition , transactivation with combinations of ETSI , NFB and API is highly synergistic and interdependent , suggesting that these factors interact as a higher order transcriptional complex in activated T cells .
Although ETS1 could not transactivate a GM-CSF promoter reporter construct co-transfected into unstimulated Jurkat T cells , both NFxB ( p50 and p65 ) and AP1 ( c-Fos and c-Jun ) could .
However , co-transfection of ETSl with either or both NFxB and API resulted in additional , or synergistic , transactivation , which is similar to that achieved by co-transfection of ETSI into cells treated with PMA and ionomycin .
Additionally , mutations designed to eliminate binding of NFxB or API reduced the ability of PMA /ionomycin to induce GM-CSF transcription ( as did an ETS mutation ) .
These mutations also significantly reduced the ability of ETSl to transactivate GM-CSF in T cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin .
Binding of endogenous ETS1 in Jurkat T cells was constitutive , and NFxB and API were induced , following PMA/ionomycin treatment ( also discussed later ) .
Together , these results suggest that ; ( 1 ) constitutive ETS1l and induced NFxB and API are necessary for PMA/ionomycin mediated GM-CSF expression ; ( 2 ) PMA/ionomycin induces co-factors required for ETSl activity rather than directing any modification of ETS1 and might increase its binding affinity ; and ( 3 ) that these factors are NFxB and/or API .
The concept that ETS1l may act only in coordination with transcriptional partners is supported by a recent study that has identified a link between ETSI transactivation of the TIMP-1 promoter and its requirement for the presence of API ( Logan et al. , 1996 ) .
Surprisingly , another recently published paper has found that the GM-CSF promoter can be transactivated by ETSl in unstimulated T cells ( Nimer et al. , 1996 ) , which conflicts with the data presented here .
Their study involved the use of a truncated promoter in which the NFxB , Spl , CBF , and possibly API and YY1 binding sites , of the full-length promoter , are missing .
Thus , although our results suggest that ETS1l requires other co-factors for transactivation , there may also be inhibitory mechanisms that operate through the full length promoter that prevent ETS1 from transactivating alone .
We have shown that at least three ETS-like factors in Jurkat nuclear lysates bound the ETS site of CLEO in the proximal GM-CSF promoter .
These factors , including ETSI , displayed high levels of constitutive binding , before and after 4 h of PMA/ionomycin treatment .
In a previous publication ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) we have elaborated further upon ETSl binding to this site and provide evidence to suggest that ETSI specifically is required for GM-CSF transcription following T cell stimulation with PMA/ionomycin .
However , some controversy exists as to whether ETSI can be involved in the transcription of genes induced by T cell activation since ETSl mRNA and protein levels are reduced following activation signals ( Bhat et al. , 1990 ; Romano-Spica et al. , 1995 ) .
In addition , the 2851 Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al 2852 binding activity of pSl ETSl can be reduced by calcium dependent phosphorylation ( Fisher et al. , 1991 ; Rabault and Ghysdael , 1994 ) .
In fact , it has been suggested that ETS1l can act as a repressor and contributes to IL-2 expression in activated T cells due to a consequent reduction in its binding ( Romano-Spica et al. , 1995 ) .
We believe that the consequences of these considerations are allayed by the following points : ( 1 ) the reduction in ETS1l protein levels only occurs relatively late in the activation process , due to changes in de novo synthesis ( Romano-Spica et al. , 1995 ) ; ( 2 ) although phosphorylation occurs quickly ( within 5 min ) , the alternatively spliced p42 ETSI product , expressed in T cells , lacks this inhibitory phosphorylation domain ( Koizumi et al. , 1990 ; Fisher et al. , 1991 ) ; ( 3 ) other phosphorylation sites present in both forms of ETSl have been linked to enhanced transactivator activity ( Bradford et al. , 1995 ; Yang et al. , 1996 ) ; ( 4 ) inactivation of the ets !
gene in mice results in T cells that display severe proliferative defects in response to activating signals ( Muthusamy et al. , 1995 ) , which indicates that ETS1l is required for T cell activation .
Thus several lines of evidence , including the data presented here , suggest that ETSI can be involved in transcription of genes during T cell activation .
Possibly , ETS1 function is attenuated late in T cell activation via negative feedback mechanisms .
Binding of NFxB and API factors to their respective binding sites in CLE2/GC-box and CLEO of the GM CSF promoter were undetectable in unstimulated Jurkat cells , but were strongly induced upon 4 h of PMA/ionomycin treatment .
The induced NFxB complexes were identified as p50/p50 homodimers and p50/ p65 heterodimers , and multiple API complexes were constituted by Fos and Jun family members including c-Fos and c-Jun .
It is likely that p50/p65 constitutes a transcriptionally active complex ( Schmitz and Baeuerle , 1991 ) , and the different API dimers may exhibit varying positive or negative transactivating properties ( Deng and Karin , 1993 ) .
Our results confirm and extend the findings of others who have analysed binding to the GMxB and GMAPI sites ( Boise et al. , 1993 ; Wang et al. , 1994 ; Himes et al. , 1996 ) , and provide clues as to which NFxB and API family members may synergise with ETSl in vivo .
NFxB complexes are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm as precursors or by binding IxB ( Beg et al. , 1992 ; Finco and Baldwin , 1995 ) , an association that is known to be disrupted by PKC mediated phosphorylation and proteolysis of IxB and p105 ( the p50 precursor ) ( Israel , 1995 ; Li et al. , 1995 ; Verma et al. , 1995 ) .
Phosphorylation of p50 also results in a higher level of DNA binding stability ( Li et al. , 1994 ) , and increased p105 transcription is mediated by PMA ( Meyer et al. , 1991 ; Cogswell et al. , 1993 ) .
All of these mechanisms are potentially involved in the induction of NFxB binding observed .
The induction of API binding by PMA and ionomycin was probably mediated by PKC/Ca '' + dependent phosphorylation dephosphorylation and consequent increased binding affinity ( Boyle et al. , 1991 ; Karin , 1995 ) , and by increased transcription of Fos/Jun family members ( Makover et al. , 1991 ; Rincon and Flavell , 1994 ; Janknecht , 1995 ) .
Interestingly , both NFxB and API binding would be expected to increase shortly after stimulation of the cells by PMA ( Boyle et al. , 1991 ; Li et al. , 1994 ) , and , in the case of NFxB be inhibited thereafter by newly synthesized IxB ( Finco and Baldwin , 1995 ) .
The data presented here clearly show that both NFB and API binding activities remain high in cells treated with PMA /ionomycin for 4 h , a time point at which we estimated the GM-CSF promoter was most active ( data not shown ) .
Gene disruption of members of the NFxB/Rel family in mice produces T cell defects ; disrupted p50 results in T cells with decreased ability to proliferate in response to activation signals ( Sha et al. , 1995 ) ; p65 inactivation is an embryonic lethal mutation , but does cause defects in GM-CSF induction in cell lines ( Beg et al. , 1995b ) ; and c-rel disruption results both in defects in T cell proliferation ( Kontgen et al. , 1995 ) and GM-CSF transcription ( Gerondakis et al. , 1996 ) .
Inactivation of IxB results in enhanced granulopoiesis ( Beg et a/. , 1995a ) , possibly caused by increased or constitutive expression of cytokines such as GM-CSF .
Gene disruption of c-jun in mice appears to have no effect upon T cell proliferation or activation ( Chen et al. , 1994 ) , but c-fos activation results in dramatically reduced numbers of certain T cell sub-sets ( Johnson et al. , 1992 ; Wang et al. , 1992 ) , although these results are not supported by others ( Jain et al. , 1994 ) .
Similarly to ETS !
gene inactivation , these experiments have accentuated the importance of NFxB and API in the events of T cell activation , although there may be some redundancy in function between the different API family members .
Co-transfection with combinations of ETSI , NFxB and API resulted in strongly synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter in unstimulated cells .
In all experiments , transactivation was either greatly reduced or abolished by mutation of any of the ETS , NFxB or API binding sites .
These results demonstrate that ETSI1 , NFxB and API transcription factors primarily mediate transactivation through direct interaction with their binding sites , but also require the binding of adjacent factors .
Even transactivation by NFxB and API alone were also shown to involve the ETS binding site , possibly by interacting with constitutive ETSI , or another endogenous ETS family member .
Thus , a complex , interdependent , interaction between ETSI1 , NFxB and API factors appears to play a role in controlling GM-CSF transcription .
Cooperative synergism between ETSl and API has been demonstrated previously with other promoters ( Wasylyk et al. , 1990 ; Majerus et al. , 1992 ) , and API and NFxB are known to synergise in transcriptional activation of the GM-CSF promoter ( Tsuboi et al. , 1994 ) .
Our data shows that ETSl and NFxB also exhibit transcriptional synergy .
The relationship between these three factors may in part be explained by findings that ETS proteins can physically associate with API in activated T cells ( Bassuk and Leiden , 1995 ) , a process required for transcription involving ETS/API1 enhancers .
Also , p65 associates with c-Fos and c-Jun ( Stein et al. , 1993 ) , and , our preliminary data suggests , also with ETS1 ( data not shown ) .
Additionally , these factors can cooperate and potentially associate with other constitutive factors that bind the proximal GM-CSF promoter , such as Spl ( Gegonne et al. , 1993 ; Masuda et al. , 1994 ; Perkins et al. , 1994 ; Ye et al. , 1996 ) , CBF ( Wotton et al. , 1994 ) and perhaps YYl1 ( Ye et al. , 1994 ) .
Direct promoter association of ETS1l , NFB , API and other factors , as well as with each other , potentially comprises a higher order transcriptional complex capable of mediating high levels of GM-CSF transcription .
We do not yet know the mechanism by which such synergy is accomplished , but could involve increased binding affinity and/or decreased degradation of the combined factors , formation of binding surfaces for additional factors or components of the transcriptional machinery , and/or local conformational changes in the DNA .
Support for any of these models of cooperativity is preliminary .
However , some clues exist , such as the ability of p65 to functionally interact with TATA binding protein and TFIIB , components of the basic transcriptional machinery ( Schmitz et al. , 1995 ) , and the proposed abilities of NFxB and API to induce bending of DNA upon binding ( Kerppola and Curran , 1991 ; Pazin et al. , 1996 ) .
It seems likely that further study of the GM CSF promoter will describe a very complex set of interactive transcriptional control mechanisms .
Materials and methods Cell lines and culture Jurkat cells , a human leukemic T cell line , were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin .
Monkey COS7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum , penicillin and streptomycin as above .
Both cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5 % CO , .
Plasmid constructs for transfection pGM600 contains approximately 600 bp of sequence preceding the transcription initiation site of the human GM-CSF promoter .
An EcoRI-HindlII fragment from pHGMO.6 ( Cockerill et al. , 1993 ) containing the promoter was inserted upstream of the CAT reporter gene in pCAT-BASIC ( Promega ) .
pGM600-ETSm1 , pGM600-xBm1l and pGM600-AP1m1 contain mutations in the ETS , NFxB and AP1 binding sites analogous to those found in the oligonucleotides ETSm1 , xBm1l and APIlm1 , respectively .
Mutations of the GM-CSF promoter were produced by PCR of pGM600 using oligonucleotides containing the respective mutations .
The resulting PCR products were substituted back into pGM600 .
The ETS1 , c-Fos and c-Jun expression constructs are based on the pEFBOS expression vector ( Mizushima and Nagata , 1990 ) .
The human etsl cDNA from pGEMT7HE-1 ( Watson et al. , 1988 ) was subcloned as a blunt KpnlI-HindlII fragment into the blunt-ended Xbel cloning site of pEFBOS .
Human c-fos and mouse c-jun cDNAs ( gifts of Jane Visvader , Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research ) were blunt cloned into pEFBOS .
p50 ( Apal insert ) and p65 ( Nof insert ) NFxB subunit cDNAs were ligated into the pRC/ CMV ( Invitrogen ) expression vector ( Dunn et al. , 1994 ) .
The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by sequence analysis .
Transfection of Jurkat cells and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays Jurkat cells were transfected with 10 ug CAT reporter plasmid and 6 ug of expression constructs as previously described ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) .
PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 ng/ml ) was added to the growth media 24 h following transfection , where appropriate .
Cells were harvested a further 24 h later and processed for CAT Synergistic transactivation of the GM-CSF promoter RS Thomas et al assays as previously described ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) .
The raw CAT data for each construct ( pGM600 , pGM600-ETSm1 , pGM600- « xBm1l , pGM600-APlm1l ) , with the various treatment/co-transfections , was normalised to its own basal expression , which was given the value of 'one ' .
The mean , and standard error of the mean ( s.e.m .
) , of at least four replicates for each experiment was graphed to show a 'fold induction ' over basal expression , to facilitate comparison between the different mutations and treatments/co-transfections .
Data were subjected to statistical analysis using unpaired f-tests , with resultant P values less than 0.05 considered significant .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) Recombinant p50 , c-Fos and c-Jun were produced by transient transfection of the respective expression vectors into COS cells Sub-confluent cells were trypsinized , washed in growth medium ( as above ) , and resuspended in PBS with 20 mm HEPES at 5x cells/ml .
Three-hundred ul of cells were mixed with 20 ug DNA in 0.4 cm gap electroporation cuvettes and pulsed at 170 V and 500 uF ( Biorad Gene Pulsar ) .
Cells were replated into 10 cm petri dishes and harvested 24 h later .
Jurkat cells were grown to 5x 10° cells/ml and were untreated or treated with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 ng/ml ) for 4 h prior to harvest .
Nuclear lysates from COS and Jurkat cells were prepared as previously described ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) .
DNA binding experiments with nuclear lysates were performed using EMSA , as previously described ( Thomas et al. , 1995 ) .
Briefly , purified double stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [ « - '' P ] dATP by Klenow fill-in reaction .
One ng oligonucleotide probe was incubated for 10 min with 2 ug protein in DNA binding buffer ( 1 mM EDTA , 10 mm Tris.Cl pH 8.0 , 50 mm NaCl , 5 mM MgCl , , 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 1 mg/ml BSA , 500 ng/ml - poly-d ( I-C ) .d ( I-C ) , - 500 ng/ml - poly-dI.dC , 200 ng/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA ) , +100 ng unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides , +antibodies , in 10 ul final volume .
Assays were run through non-denaturing , 7 % acrylamide ( 29 acrylamide:1 bis-acrylamide ) , 0.5 x TBE gels , until free oligonucleotides had run off the bottom of the gel , to maximise separation of complexes .
