IL-2-Independent Activation and Proliferation in Human T Cells Induced by CD28 !
George Boulougouris , Julie D. McLeod , Yusuf I. Patel , Claire N. Ellwood , Lucy S. K. Walker , and David M. Sansom Although the role of CD28 in T cell costimulation is firmly established , the mechanisms by which it exerts its costimulatory actions are less clear .
In many circumstances it is difficult to distinguish the effects of CD28 from subsequent actions of cytokines , such as IL-2 , on T cell proliferation .
Here , we report a model of CD28 costimulation using PMA plus the natural ligand CD80 that resulted in very limited stimulation of IL-2 , as evidenced by both cytokine production and IL-2 promoter stimulation .
Promoter assays revealed CD28-dependent effects on both NF-xB and AP-1 , but not on NF-AT or the intact IL-2 promoter .
In addition , T cell proliferation was completely resistant to the actions of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
Moreover T cell proliferation was unaffected by the addition of blocking Abs to both IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor , demonstrating that this form of costimulation by CD28 was independent of IL-2 .
We also investigated the effects of stimulating T cell blasts with CD80 alone and found that there was a limited requirement for IL-2 in this system .
We conclude that CD28 costimulation can cause substantial T cell proliferation in the absence of IL-2 , which is driven by a soluble factor independent of NF-AT transactivation .

TCR by foreign Ags in complex with MHC molecules , other pathways are important for T cell proliferation .
These pathways include the delivery of costimulation through the CD28 receptor as well as the subsequent production of cytokines , such as IL-2 , and signals through the IL-2 receptor .
Studies using mice deficient for CD28 and IL-2 demonstrate a number of defects reflecting the importance of these receptors to both T cell and B cell immune responses ( 1 , 2 ) .
Intriguingly , however , rather than the predicted immunodeficient phenotype , IL-2-deficient mice suffer from T cell lymphoproliferation and a syndrome reminiscent of inflammatory bowel disease ( 2 ) .
This clearly indicates that cytokines other than IL-2 may be important in T cell proliferation .
CD28 is a surface glycoprotein expressed on the majority of T cells that interacts with two known natural ligands ( CD80 and CD86 ) ( 3 ) .
Both ligands are expressed by professional APCs , and both are capable of costimulating responses via CD28 .
One of the most striking features associated with CD28 costimulation is the ability of this pathway to prevent the induction of a tolerant state known as T cell anergy , an ability closely linked with the induction and secretion of a number of cytokines ( 3-6 ) , of which IL-2 ap- I n addition to signals initiated following engagement of the Department of Pharmacology , University of Bath , Bath , United Kingdom ; and Bath Institute for Rheumatic Diseases , Bath , United Kingdom Received for publication October 22 , 1998 .

One interpretation is , therefore , that costimulation of T cell proliferation and prevention of anergy by CD28 is mediated largely by IL-2 production and that IL-2 is responsible for many CD28 effects .
A major feature of signals initiated by CD28 costimulation is the resistance of this pathway to the calcineurin inhibitor , CsA , although the degree of resistance observed has been variable .
This may relate to the fact that Abs to CD28 can generate a calcium signal ( 7 , 8 ) that is dependent on the degree of cross-linking , which then leads to an apparently CsA-sensitive signal .
In contrast , it appears that natural ligands do not stimulate calcium elevation .
Whether or not CD28 is sensitive to CsA has considerable implications for the interpretation of costimulatory signals , since CsA is known to inhibit nuclear entry of the transcription factor NF-AT that is required for IL-2 gene transcription ( 9 ) .
Thus , if CD28 signals are resistant to CsA , this would suggest that CD28 has either NF-AT-independent effects on IL-2 production , or IL-2-independent costimulatory functions that would therefore dissociate CD28 costimulation from the effects of IL-2-driven proliferation .
Attempts to understand the signaling mechanisms of CD28 have identified several pathways , including activation and recruitment of the enzyme phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( PI3K ) , as well as a pathway via acidic sphingomyelinase ( 10-12 ) .
Nonetheless , the involvement of these pathways in costimulation of IL-2 production is still unclear ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) .
Downstream of PI3K , the effects of CD28 stimulation include activation of the ser/thr kinase protein kinase B ( PKB ) and subsequently p7086 kinase ( 15-17 ) indicating a possible role for PI3K in cell cycle progression .
In addition , the PI3K pathway also appears to be involved in CD28 receptor recycling ( 18 ) , and it is clear that CD28 costimulation has other functions , such as protection from cell death and increasing longevity of T cell responses ( 19-22 ) .
CD28 costimulatory signals are also thought to converge with signals from the TCR , resulting in the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , which is required for the generation of the transcription factor AP-1 ( 23 ) .
This , along with the influence of transcription factors NF- « B and NF-AT , provides the basis for 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 1810 transcriptional activation of IL-2 gene transcription ( 24 ) .
Conse-quently , much of the interpretation of CD28 costimulation has been based on analysis of IL-2 transcription and production .
To address the role of IL-2 production as a component of CD28 costimulation and to investigate the effects of CsA on CD28 responses triggered by the natural ligand CD80 , we compared two distinct T cell stimulation protocols , using either PMA and ionomycin or PMA plus CD80 ligand for their ability to stimulate T cells and support IL-2 production .
These experiments revealed that T cells proliferated strongly to both stimuli ; however , PMA plus CD8O-stimulated proliferation occurred in a completely CsA-resistant fashion whereas PMA plus ionomycin was sensitive to CsA .
Strikingly , irrespective of whether CsA was used , PMA- and CD8O-stimulated cells displayed a highly impaired ability to produce IL-2 , and , using neutralizing Abs to IL-2 and IL-2 receptor , we observed that proliferation was independent of IL-2 .
Consistent with this observation , studies on the IL-2 gene promoter indicated that PMA plus CD80 could stimulate activity of NF- « B and AP-1 elements , but not NF-AT or the intact IL-2 promoter activity , while PMA plus ionomycin stimulated all elements .
Finally , using activated T cells stimulated with CD80 alone , we also observed similar CD28-mediated proliferative responses that also proceeded in a largely IL-2-independent manner .
These data suggest that CD28 is capable of T cell costimulation independently of IL-2 and NF-AT in a CsA-resistant manner .
Materials and Methods T cell purification Purified resting T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy human donors .
PBMC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation at 800 X g for 30 min ( Nycomed 1.077 g/ml ) , and the buoyant layer was isolated .
Following two washes with medium , the cells were further purified by adhering to plastic for 1 h at 37°C in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 + 10 % FCS and antibiotics ) .
Nonadherent cells containing the T cell population were recovered and incubated with mAbs against CD14 ( UCHM ! 1 ) , HLA-DR ( L243 ) , and CD19 ( BU12 ) .
Stained cells were magnetically removed using sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads ( Dynal , Oslo , Nor-way ) .
The remaining cells , which comprised the resting T cell population , were used in subsequent experiments .
For experiments using T cell blasts , PBMCs were taken following density gradient centrifugation and washing .
These were then cultured with superantigen SEA ( 10 ng/m ! )
in complete medium .
After 4-6 days , blasts were washed and utilized .
Transfectants Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells were transfected with the CD80 cDNA expressed under the control of a CMV promoter , generated as previously described ( 25 ) .
Cells were maintained in glutamine-free DMEM containing 10 % FCS , plus penicillin and streptomycin .
Before use , cells were trypsinized and washed in PBS and then fixed with 0.025 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2-3 min .
Cells were washed extensively with medium containing 10 % FCS , counted , and utilized .
T cell proliferation assays Proliferation assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates in a final volume of 200 gl per well in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS and antibiotics .
T cells ( 5 X 10 '' ) were cultured either alone or stimulated as specified in figure legends or incubated with either CHO or CHO-CD80 cells at a ratio of 3:1 T cell to transfectants .
Proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation after a further 72 h. Where anti-CD28 Abs were used , the Ab 9.3 was added at 1 pg/ml and cross-linked using sheep anti-mouse IgG ( 5 ug/m ! ) .
Assays were incubated at 37°C for 72 h , at which time aliquots were removed for IL-2 analysis ( DuoSet-ELISA , Gen-zyme , Boston , MA ) , and the cells were incubated for a further 18 h with the addition of 1 Ci per well .
Cells were harvested onto 96-well filter plates using a Packard ( Meriden , CT ) 96-well harvester , and [ *HJthymidine uptake was determined via liquid scintillation counting .
Blocking Abs were added at the start of culture in 50-pl volumes to the final concentrations indicated in the figures .
Data are plotted as mean values of triplicate wells .
SEs were always less than 10 % of the mean value .
IL-2-INDEPENDENT T CELL PROLIFERATION Carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester labeling To determine cell division of T cells , resting T cells were labeled with carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) ( Molecular Probes , Leiden , NL ) .
T cells were labeled using 2.5 uM CFSE in PBS for 3 min and then washed twice in complete medium .
Cells were then subjected to stimulation as described in the figure legends , using PMA , PMA +CD80 , and PMA + ionomycin , and fluorescence was monitored by FACS at various times after stimulation .
Luciferase Assays Plasmids encoding multimerized NF-AT , NF-B , or AP-1 or the complete IL-2 promoter were used as previously described ( 26 ) .
Jurkat cells ( 5 % 10° ) were transiently transfected by electroporation at 320 V , 960 LF in 1 ml of complete medium .
After 24 h , Jurkat cells were stimulated for 8 h as detailed in figure legends or with CHO transfectants at a 1:3 ratio .
Cytoplasmic extracts were performed using luciferase assay kit ( Promega , Mad-ison , WI ) .
Briefly , cells were resuspended in lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 15 min .
Two freeze and thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen aided the cytoplasmic extraction , and after a brief centrifugation 20 pl of the supernatant was used with 100 pl of luciferase assay reagent .
Luminescence was measured immediately for 10 s with the TD-20/20 Lumi-nometer or using a Packard Top Count .
FACS analysis FACS analysis was undertaken using the following Abs at 1 pg/ml : anti-CD2 ( OKT11 ; American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) , Manassas , VA ) , anti-CD25 ( HB8784 ; ATCC ) , anti-CD69 ( 55.3.1 ; Serotec , Oxford , U.K. ) , and anti-CD28 ( YTH913.12 ; Serotec ) The primary Abs were added for 30 min at 4°C , cells were washed in PBS , and the secondary anti-mouse polyvalent FITC ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) was added for 30 min at 4°C .
Five thousand events were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson ( Mountain View , CA ) FACStar '' '' '' using a 488-nm 100-mW laser .
Results PMA plus CD80 induces proliferation in a completely CsA-resistant fashion Several studies have used PMA in synergy with Abs to CD28 to investigate the role of CD28 as a costimulatory receptor in T cell activation ( 7 , 27 ) .
However , few of these studies have used the natural ligands of CD28 , and confusion has arisen over the sensitivity of CD28 costimulation to CsA .
Since stimulation via the TCR is inherently CsA sensitive , we utilized the ability of PMA and the natural ligand CD80 to costimulate proliferative responses to clarify the effect of CsA on the CD28 pathway .
As shown in Fig .
1 , purified T cells proliferated well in the presence of PMA and CHO-CD80 cells together , although not to either stimulus alone .
Moreover , this type stimulation was resistant to the immunosup-pressive drug CsA , and in a large number of experiments we did not observe any CsA sensitivity in using this system .
In contrast , stimulation of T cells with PMA and ionomycin was highly sensitive to CsA .
To establish that both forms of stimulation resulted in expansion of T cells with similar phenotypes , we also performed flow cytometric analysis of the T cells activated by P +I and PMA + CD80 .
These results ( Fig .
2 ) confirmed that the responding T cells was phenotypically similar in each case and displayed typical activation markers such as €D69 and CD25 .
The only difference observed was that those cells that received CD80 stimulation expressed a lower level of CD28 , which occurs as a result of ligand engagement and is due to receptor internalization ( 18 , 28 ) .
Overall , however , these experiments clearly demonstrated that costimulation with the natural ligand CD80 resulted in proliferation of phenotypically normal cells via a CsA-resistant pathway .
PMA and CD80 is an insufficient signal for IL-2 production Given that proliferation of T cells to PMA plus CD80 was completely CsA resistant , we next tested whether IL-2 production was similarly unaffected by CsA , as has been suggested previously 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology I Control [ ] +Csa 50000 40000 = 30000 Q 20000 10000 O & T fas } O 0 £ + 4 < = S oa A.

We therefore measured the effect of CsA on IL-2 production in response to PMA plus CD80 stimulation .
Interestingly , we observed that resting human T cells stimulated in this manner produced very limited amounts of IL-2 ( Fig .

These results were surprising not only because of the ability of T cells to proliferate to PMA and CD80 despite extremely limited amounts of IL-2 ( most notably in the presence of CsA ) but also because previous studies have suggested that CD28 Abs synergized with PMA to induce IL-2 , which was CsA resistant .

PMA/CD80 or P + I give rise to similar activated T cell phenotypes .
T cells were stimulated with PMA alone ( A ) , PMA plus CD80 ( B ) , or stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin ( C ) .
Flow cytometric analysis of activated T cells was performed after 72 h with Abs to the surface markers shown .
Cells were analyzed for FITC fluorescence at 520 nm .
6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 1812 similar experiments using cross-linked anti-CD28 Abs ( Fig .
3 ) , we also observed substantial IL-2 production , which was not evident using natural ligand .
Moreover , this level of cytokine was sensitive to CsA , indicating that it derived from a calcineurin-dependent pathway , most likely due to calcium signals elicited from cross-linking CD28 .
However , the IL-2 production stimulated by anti-CD28 , while mainly sensitive to CsA , did reveal some residual CsA-resistant IL-2 production , which may be a feature of anti-CD28 stimulation .
Thus , our results clearly demonstrated an obvious disparity between the ability of T cell to proliferate to PMA and CD80 stimulation and their ability to produce IL-2 .
This suggested several possibilities ; either small amounts of IL-2 could sustain high levels of proliferation , the T cells consumed IL-2 more rapidly when stimulated by PMA and CD80 , or that T cell proliferation may not be IL-2 dependent in this system .
In addition , these data highlighted substantial differences between the results obtained using anti-CD28 Abs and natural ligands .
PMA and CD80 stimulate NF- « B and AP-1 transactivation but not NF-AT or the intact IL-2 promoter To further understand the differences in signaling between PMA and CD80 compared with PMA and ionomycin and their differential effects on IL-2 production , we next examined the effects of these stimuli on the transcription factors NFB , AP-1 , NF-AT and on the intact IL-2 promoter .
To establish the effect of CD80 on the transactivation of the IL-2 promoter and its components , we used luciferase reporters transiently transfected into Jurkat cells .
As shown in Fig .
44 , PMA alone was unable to induce substantial NF-KB activity without the addition of ionomycin , and as expected this activation was fully blocked by CsA .
In contrast , CD80 was also able to partially activate NF-KB , increasing the response ~2-fold over PMA alone , but , notably , this enhancement was resistant to CsA , suggesting that pathways leading from CD28 to NFB stimulation could be partially responsible for the CsA-resistant costimulatory effect of CD28 .
Similar experiments were also performed using AP-1 reporter constructs .
In examining the transactivation of AP-1 ( Fig .
4B ) , PMA was found to strongly induce AP-1 luciferase activity , which was enhanced by the addition of ionomycin and blocked by CsA .
Significantly , CD80 stimulation also enhanced the PMA-driven response , and like NFB this was completely resistant to CsA .
Thus , both NFB and AP-1 responses were stimulated by CD28 in a CsA-resistant manner .
We also investigated the effects of PMA and CD80 stimulation of the transcriptional activity of both NFE-AT and the whole IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
4 , C and D , respectively ) .
The NF-AT transcription factor is known to be dependent on calcium signaling , and specifically calcineurin , for its translocation to the nucleus , an event that is blocked by CsA ( 9 ) .
However , a partially calcineurin-indepen-dent mechanism has been suggested to be initiated by CD28 Abs ( 29 ) .
Using luciferase assays , we observed a strong NF-AT response to stimulation by PMA and ionomycin that , as predicted , was completely blocked by CsA .
However , in contrast to our results for NFB and AP-1 , we were unable to significantly activate the NF-AT reporter construct with the PMA and CD80 .
In addition , using a reporter construct containing the whole IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
4D ) , similar results were obtained to those with NF-AT .
In this case , however , CD80 was able to slightly enhance IL-2 activation induced by PMA , although this effect was blocked by CsA , suggesting it could not account for the CsA-resistant CD28 effect on T cell proliferation .
However , we did observe that , in the presence of P +I , CD80 stimulation was able to further stimulate the IL-2 promoter , suggesting that CD28 could only significantly aug IL-2-INDEPENDENT T CELL PROLIFERATION Luciferase units Luciferase units P+CD80+CsA O Luciferase units Luciferase units P+CD80+CsA Luciferase units Luciferase units PMA-CD28 PMA-CD28® PMA-CO28 PMA-CD28 9 ® a O + < 2 & PMA+ CD80 FIGURE 4 .
IL-2 promoter activity is poorly stimulated by PMA/CD80 .
Luciferase assays were performed in Jurkat cells using reporters linked to NF-KB ( 4 ) , AP-1 ( B ) , NF-AT ( C ) , and the intact IL-2 promoter ( D ) .
Experiments comparing CD80 and anti-CD28 are shown for NF-AT ( E ) and IL-2 ( F ) .
Stimulations ( 8 h ) were performed 24 h following transfection , and luciferase activity was detected using a luminometer .

ment activation of the IL-2 promoter in the context of calcium-dependent signals ( data not shown ) .
In addition to these experiments , we also directly compared the abilities of CD80 and anti-CD28 mAb for their abilities to stimulate NF-AT ( E ) and the IL-2 promoter ( F ) constructs .
These results showed similar findings for both constructs in that both PMA/ CD80 and PMA plus CD28 Abs ( not cross-linked ) were poor stim-ulators of the constructs .
However , cross-linking of the anti-CD28 Ab using a sheep anti-mouse Ig consistently gave a 2- to 3-fold stimulation of both NF-AT and IL-2 , suggesting that cross-linking CD28 Abs provides different signals to the natural ligand .
This observation was consistent with our observations in Fig .
3 , suggesting that cross-linked anti-CD28 Ab and CD80 ligand had different effects on IL-2 transcription .
However , it was notable that the levels of luciferase activity seen with cross-linked anti-CD28 were at least 10-fold lower than those with PMA and ionomycin in the same assay .
Overall , however these results indicated that both NFB and AP-1 responses were stimulated by CD28 ligation and that the pathways leading to activation of these transcription factors were CsA resistant .
In contrast , PMA and CD80 did not effectively stimulate NF-AT or the IL-2 promoter in the absence of a calcium flux , consistent with our data from normal T cell stimulations , indicating that IL-2 transcription was poorly stimulated in response to 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology -- Q -- _ CD3+CD80 A __ PMA+CD80 100000 -- O -- _ PMA+Iono 75000 ps A .

PMA/CD80 costimulation does not depend on IL-2 .
The effects of blocking Abs to IL-2 ( 4 ) and IL-2R ( B ) were tested on T cell proliferation .
Cells were stimulated with either PI ( circles ) , PMA and CD80 ( triangles ) , or CD3 and CD80 ( squares ) .
The effects on cell proliferation were measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation at 72 h. PMA and CD80 .
In addition , these assays further revealed differences in the ability of anti-CD28 to stimulate the IL-2 promoter , depending on whether or not the Ab was cross-linked .
Anti-IL-2 and anti-IL-2R Abs do not inhibit PMA + CD80 proliferation Taking the above results together , it did not appear that IL-2 was likely to be responsible for T cell proliferation to PMA and CD80 stimulation .
Nonetheless , since it was still formally possible that PMA- and CD8O-stimulated T cells produced small amounts of IL-2 sufficient to drive proliferation , we examined this possibility using blocking Abs to IL-2 and the IL-2R .
As shown in Fig .
5 , A and B , proliferation of the cells stimulated with PMA and CD80 1813 25000 +CHO 20000 W cHo-coso 15000 CPM 10000 5000 Untreated Anti-IL-2 ( ug/ml ) FIGURE 6 .
CD80 stimulation of activated T cells is substantially IL-2 independent .

The effect of anti-IL-2 was tested at the doses shown , and proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation 36 h after stimulation .

was not inhibited by blocking Abs to either IL-2 or the IL-2R , demonstrating that IL-2 was not responsible for the proliferative response to PMA and CD80 .
In fact , if anything , these Abs caused slight enhancement of responses .
This lack of inhibition was not due to the inability of the Abs to block since substantial inhibition was observed in T cell responses stimulated by either anti-CD3 plus CD80 or with P + I .
However , these Abs only partially inhibited proliferation to PMA and ionomycin , indicating that , like PMA + CD80 , this response was also only partially IL-2 depen-dent .
Nonetheless , it was clear from these experiments that IL-2 was not required to sustain proliferation to PMA and CD80 .
Activated T cells can be stimulated by CD80 in a largely IL-2-independent manner The above situation , where T cells proliferated well despite their inability to generate significant quantities of IL-2 or activate components of the IL-2 promoter , was reminiscent of our previous studies using activated T cells that were capable of responding to CD80 ligation alone ( 12 ) .
Given that PMA stimulation is not a physiologically relevant stimulus , we wondered whether CD80 stimulation of T cell blasts might represent a similar situation where IL-2 was not required .
We therefore investigated the effects of CD80 stimulation on SEA-activated T cell blasts .
Accordingly , 5-day-old blasts were washed and then recultured with either CD80 or CHO control cells , and the effects of anti IL-2 Abs were tested .
As shown in Fig .
6 , the CD80-stimulated cells continued to proliferate whereas the control cells did not .
Furthermore , the addition of blocking anti-IL-2 Abs revealed that this inhibited only ~20 % of the response , indicating that IL-2 was also not essential for T cell proliferation under these circumstances .
Thus , these experiments confirmed the possibility that IL-2-independent T cell proliferation may also occur under more physiological circumstances .
PMA + CD80-stimulated cells undergo cell division Finally , given that tritiated thymidine incorporation represents DNA labeling in S phase , but not necessarily actual cell division , we tested whether PMA- and CD80-stimulated cells divided similarly to cells from P + I-stimulated cultures .

Resting T cells were labeled with 2.5 M CFSE and stimulated with PMA ( 4 ) , PMA + CD80 ( B ) , or PMA + ionomycin ( C ) .

By labeling T cells before cell division with CFSE , cell division can then be monitored by the decrease in dye content of the cells as the dye is divided between daughter cells .
The data shown in Fig .
7 indicated that , over a 7-day period , the CFSE content of the cells decreased over 10-fold in the PMA + CD80 ( Fig .
78 ) and the P + I cultures ( Fig .
7C ) .
In contrast , the cells stimulated with PMA alone did not show any decrease in cell staining .
In addition , viable cell numbers increased in the PMA + CD80 and P + I cultures by ~6-fold over the same period .

PMA and CD80 stimulates production of a CsA-resistant proliferative factor .
Resting T cells were stimulated with PMA + CHO , PMA + CD80 , or PI in the absence ( filled bars ) or presence of CsA ( hatched bars ) .
Supernatants were removed and applied to 3-day-old T cell blasts with IL-2 as a positive control .
Proliferation was measured 36 h after the transfer of supernatant by tritiated thymidine incorporation .
together , these data provided unequivocal evidence that the T cells were undergoing cell division in response to PMA + CD80 in a manner that was IL-2 independent .
PMA + CD80-dependent T cell proliferation is mediated by a soluble factor Whereas we had established that IL-2 was not responsible for T cell responses to PMA and CD80 , we wished to establish whether proliferation was dependent on a soluble factor or whether CD28 signals were driving proliferation directly .
To test this , we transferred supernatants from cultures stimulated with various treatments onto previously activated day 5 T cell blasts .
As shown in Fig .
8 , this revealed that treatment with PMA and CD80 resulted in the secretion of a soluble factor that could cause proliferation when transferred to T cell blasts .
Likewise , the supernatant from PMA + ionomycin stimulation could also transfer a proliferative stimulus ; however , in keeping with our other observations , CsA strongly inhibited PMA + ionomycin- but not PMA + CD80-derived supernatants .
Interestingly , these effects were of similar potency as the addition of IL-2 .
Thus , this experiment indicated that cytokines were involved in both forms of proliferation although it raised the possibility that different cytokines may be in-volved , depending on the stimulation conditions .
Discussion In this paper , we report a CD28-dependent form of T cell stimulation that is resistant to CsA and independent of IL-2 .
Using the natural ligand CD80 transfected into CHO cells , we have shown that CD80 synergizes with the phorbol ester PMA to induce proliferation of purified resting T cells despite being severely compromised in their ability to produce IL-2 .
We observed that this form of stimulation was completely CsA resistant , suggesting it did not depend on the phosphatase activity of calcineurin , an enzyme known to be critical for nuclear entry of 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology the transcription factor NF-AT and control of IL-2 gene transcription ( 31 , 32 ) .
This lack of effect of CsA on CD28 costimulation is similar to that reported by others ( 7 , 27 ) ; however , there are several differences between our observations and those previously .
In our experiments we did not observe any sensitivity of CD8O-stimulated CD28 to CsA ; this contrasts to the observations of Linsley ( 7 ) , who suggested that a CsA-sensitive pathway may also derive from CD28 .
We believe these differences may be explained by the use of Abs vs natural ligands .
Indeed , our own data using cross-linked anti-CD28 Abs indicate that this type of stimulation does lead to an apparent CsA sensitivity in the CD28 pathway , which while inhibiting IL-2 production does not affect T cell proliferation .
Our findings also contrast somewhat with the findings of June et al .
( 27 ) , who observed that CD28-costimulated IL-2 mRNA induction was not inhibited by CsA .
In our experiments , we observed either limited IL-2 production using ligand or CsA-sensitive IL-2 production from cross-linked Ab .
There are several possible explanations for this .
One possibility may be that mRNA analysis by Northern blotting does not correlate well with actual IL-2 production , as measured by ELISA .
A second alternative is that their autoradiographic exposures were nonlinear , resulting in possible differences not being detected .
A third possibility is that there are genuine differences between Ab and ligand stimulation of this pathway ; indeed , several differences have been previously reported ( 33 , 34 ) .
Overall , however , despite these differences , consistent concepts do emerge from these various studies .
Clearly much , if not all , of the CD28 pathway is unaffected by CsA , and in all studies T cell proliferation is not inhibited .
In the absence of calcium signaling , as seen using PMA and CD80 , we observed that IL-2 induction was significantly impaired .
However , IL-2 production generated by Ab cross-linking appears to be sensitive to CsA , in keeping with the known effects of calcium stimulation on NF-AT .
Nonetheless , a residual CsA-resistant IL-2 signal was detected using Ab stimulation .
Overall , our interpretation of these various data is that the CsA resistance associated with CD28 costimulation is not due to the fact that IL-2 production is unaffected by CsA but that the CD28 pathway responsible for costimulation of T cell proliferation is unaffected and may ultimately be IL-2 independent .
Our findings at the functional level are supported by luciferase assays of IL-2 gene transcriptional activation .
These demonstrated that both NFE-AT and intact IL-2 promoter responses were either not stimulated by CD80 or stimulated in a manner that was CsA sensitive ( Fig .
4 , C and D ) .
While there are reports that suggest an NF-AT response in the presence of CsA ( 29 ) , these clearly represented only a minor fraction of NE-AT activation and were observed using anti-CD28 Abs .
Thus , whereas it is possible using Abs to detect CsA-resistant NF-AT and IL-2 responses , these are not easily observed using natural ligands .
In comparing CD28 Abs and CD80 ligands directly in luciferase assays in Jurkats , we observed that cross-linked anti-CD28 stimulated NF-AT and IL-2 luciferase activity to a greater degree than either soluble anti-CD28 or the CD80 ligand .
This is consistent with our data ( Fig .
3 ) , which demonstrated similar differences between anti-CD28 and CD80 ligand in IL-2 production by normal T cells .
Taken together , these data support the view that cross-linked CD28 Abs are significantly more potent stimuli for IL-2 production than the natural ligand under some conditions of T cell stimulation .
In contrast to the NF-AT and IL-2 promoter , we observed CD80 stimulation of NFxB and AP-1-driven luciferase reporters in keeping with other studies implicating CD28 in AP-1 and NFkB signaling ( 12 , 23 , 35 , 36 ) .
In addition we could only observe substantial effects on IL-2 luciferase by CD80 ligation in the presence of PI stimulation .
Given that CD80 was ineffective with PMA 1815 alone , this suggests that CD28 signals are effective on the whole IL-2 promoter only in the presence of a calcium-dependent stim-ulus .
These results would be consistent with a possible effect of CD28-stabilizing mRNA ( 37 ) .
Given the apparent discrepancy between proliferation and IL-2 production , we investigated directly the influence of IL-2 on PMA and CD80 stimulation .
Here again , our findings supported the view that IL-2 was not critical to T cell proliferation in this model .
Strikingly , neither anti-IL-2 nor anti-IL2R Abs could inhibit T cell proliferation , indicating that IL-2 was not involved in T cell proliferation driven by PMA and CD80 .
In contrast , these Abs were able to significantly inhibit proliferation by CD3 and CD80 and P + I .
Despite these surprising findings , our data are similar to those of at least two previous studies using IL-2 knockout mice .
In particular , studies by Razi-Wolf evaluated the effect of B7 costimulation on CD4 * T cells in vitro in IL-2-deficient mice ( 38 ) .
This established that B7 costimulation was still effective , and furthermore it appeared that this proliferation was independent of other cytokines , including IL-4 and other common y-chain-utiliz-ing cytokines .
Our own preliminary experiments concur with this finding in that we are unable to detect IL-4 by RT-PCR analysis .
More recently similar findings were reported by Khoruts et al .
( 39 ) , which revealed a CD28-dependent IL-2-independent function triggered by LPS .
Thus , despite our use of nonphysiological stimuli to reveal a discrete CD28 function , it appears that this model is very similar to functions of CD28 seen in vivo and in vitro on CD28 ligation using T cell blasts .
Given that T cell proliferation in the absence of IL-2 appears to be responsible for inflammatory bowel disease in mice , these studies may provide a useful and manipulable model for understanding the functional behavior of T cells that are able to operate in the absence of IL-2 and in which the negative regulatory influences of IL-2 may be studied .
