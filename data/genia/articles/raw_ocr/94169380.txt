Isolation and Characterization of Gelatinase Granules From Human Neutrophils By Lars Kjeldsen , Henrik Sengelaov , Karsten Lollike , Morten H. Nielsen , and Niels Borregaard We recently confirmed the existence of gelatinase granules as a subpopulation of peroxidase-negative granules by double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy on intact cells and by subcellular fractionation .
Further characterization of gelatinase granules has been hampered by poor separation of specific and gelatinase granules on both two-layer Percoll gradients and sucrose gradients , We have developed a three-layer Percoll density gradient that allows separation of the different granules and vesicles from human neutrophils ; in particular , it allows separation of specific and gelatinase granules .
This allows us to characterize these two granule populations with regard to their content of membrane proteins , which become incorporated into the plasma membrane during exocytosis .
We found that gelatinase granules , defined as peroxidase-negative granules containing gelatinase but lacking lactoferrin , UMAN NEUTROPHILS are equipped with a battery of proteins that contribute to the bactericidal poten- tial of the cell .
Many of these proteins , including adhesion proteins , receptors for chemotactic substances and comple- ment factors , ' '' * potent proteases , '' and the cytochrome bss ; component of the NADPH-oxidase , '' '' are localized in intra- cellular stores .
These substances are brought into contact with their respective targets only when the granules/vesicles in which they reside are exocytosed , as occurs in response to mediators of inflammation .
The existence of two neutrophil granule subpopulations has been known for decades , namely , peroxidase-positive azurophil granules and peroxidase-negative specific granules .
However , lately , the structure of the neutrophil has proven more complex .
We have demonstrated the existence of a very easily mobilizable compartment , the secretory vesicles , which is important during early neutrophil activa-tion . ''
Secretory vesicles are identified by latent alkaline phosphatase , ie , alkaline phosphatase that can only be measured in the presence of detergent .

Furthermore , we found that 20 % to 25 % of both the adhesion protein Mac-1 and the NADPH-oxidase component cytochrome bees is localized in gelatinase granules .
Although no qualitative difference was observed between specific granules and gelatinase granules with respect to cytochrome bees and Mac-1 , stimulation of the neutrophil with FMLP resulted in a selective mobilization of the least dense peroxidase-negative granules , ie , gelatinase granules , which , in concert with secretory vesicles , furnish the plasma membrane with Mac-1 and cytochrome bess .
This shows that gelatinase granules are functionally important relative to specific granules in mediating early inflammatory responses .

voir of the adhesion protein Mac-1 , * ' '' the NADPH-oxidase component cytochrome bsss , '' '' '' ' and the receptor for the chemotactic peptide FMLP . ''
Dewald et al '' } proposed the existence of yet another granule population , the gelatinase-containing granules .
This been confirmed by others , and Mac-1 , cytochrome bsss , and the receptor for FMLP have been allocated to these granules .
* '' '' * '' '' These findings , which are based on the measurement of gelatinase by a functional assay , have been questioned by double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy , which demonstrated gelatinase to be a component of specific granules . ''
We have recently resolved this discrepancy by demonstrating that the 1 35-kD form of neutrophil gelatinase is a complex of 92-kD gelatinase and a 25-kD protein that we designated NGAL . '' ''
The major part of NGAL is localized in specific granules not associated with gelatinase . ''
Using antibodies specific for gelatinase , we could demonstrate that peroxidase-negative granules exist as a continuum from the most dense granules containing lactoferrin , vitamin B ; , -binding protein , and NGAL but no gelatinase to the lightest granules containing gelatinase but no lactoferrin , vitamin B ; ; -binding protein , or NGAL .
'* '' ° The latter granules , which constitute approximately 25 % of all peroxidase-negative granules , are the most easily mobilized and our data indicate that they contain the majority of the gelatinase within the cell .
These granules are defined as gelatinase granules .
The remaining peroxidase-negative granules , which all contain lactoferrin and of which 80 % also contain gelatinase , are defined as specific granules . ''
Although gelatinase granules are lighter than specific granules , their respective densities do not differ very much .
Previously , only Graves et al ' '' have obtained a separation of a subset of granules described as specific granules containing gelatinase but lacking vitamin B ; ; -binding protein ( corresponding to `` our '' gelatinase granules ) from specific granules containing both vitamin B , ,-binding protein and gelatinase .
They used a three-layer sucrose density gradient specifically designed for this purpose . '' ''
The use of other sucrose density gradients , '' zonal sedimentation , '' and Percoll density gradients '' has resulted in a considerable overlap between the distribution profile of lactoferrin and Blood , Vol 83 , No 6 ( March 15 ) , 1994 : pp 1640-1649 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

We now present a three-layer Percoll density gradient that offers separation of specific granules and gelatinase granules .
This enables us to further characterize the gelatinase granules regarding ultrastructure , sodium dode-cyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) protein profile , and content of the membrane-associated proteins cytochrome bsss and Mac-1 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of neutrophils .
- Neutrophils were isolated from blood donated by healthy volunteers .
Blood was anticoagulated in 25 mmol/L sodium citrate , 126 mmol/L glucose .
Red blood cells were allowed to sediment for 45 minutes by the addition of equal amounts of 2 % ( wt/vol ) Dextran ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) in saline .
The leukocyte-rich supernatant was centrifuged on Lympho-prep ( Nygaard , Oslo , Norway ) at 400g for 15 minutes . ''
Remaining erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock in ice-cold water for 30 seconds and tonicity was restored by the addition of 1.8 % NaCl .
Cells were washed once in saline and resuspended in the desired buffer .
All steps except dextran sedimentation were performed at 4C .
Stimulation of neutrophils .
- For stimulation , the cells were resuspended in Krebs Ringer phosphate ( KRP ; 130 mmol/L NaCl , 5 mmol/L KCl , 1.27 mmol/L MgSO , , 0.95 mmol/L CaCl , , 5 mmol/ L glucose , 10 mmol/L NaH , HPO , /Na ; , HPO , , pH 7.4 ) at 3 X 10 '' cells/mL and preincubated for 5 minutes at 37°C .
After the addition of the stimulus ( 10 nmol/L FMLP or 2 ug/mL phorbol myristate acetate [ PMA ] ) cells were incubated for 15 minutes .
The incubation was stopped by centrifugation at 200g for 6 minutes .
The supernatant , termed So , was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in saline for subsequent subcellular fractionation .
Release of granule markers was calculated as content in S , as a percentage of the content in Sp , + S ; + P , ( see below ) .
Subcellular fractionation .
- After incubation of neutrophils with 1641 diisopropylfluorophosphate ( DFP ; 5 mmol/L ; Aldrich Chemical Co , Milwaukee , WI ) for 5 minutes and centrifugation at 200g for 6 minutes , neutrophils were resuspended at 3 to 5 X 10'/mL in disruption buffer ( 100 mmol/L KCl , 3 mmol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L ATPNa ; , , 3.5 mmol/L MgCl , , 10 mmol/L PIPES , pH 7.2 ) containing 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) .
Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation ( pressurized for 5 minutes ) as described . ''
Nuclei and intact cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400g for 15 minutes ( P ; ) .
Ten milliliters of the postnuclear supernatant ( S , ) was applied on top of a 3 X 9 mL three-layer Percoll gradient ( 1.05/1.09/1.12 g/mL ) containing 0.5 mmol/L PMSF and centrifuged at 37,0008 for 30 minutes .
This resulted in a gradient with 4 visible bands , from the bottom designated the a-band , the B , -band , the B ; , -band , and the y-band .
The cytosol was present above the y-band on top of the Percoll .
The gradient was collected in fractions of 1 mL each by aspiration from the bottom of the tube .
All fractions were assayed for markers as described below .
Marker assays .
- Myeloperoxidase ( azurophil granules ) , lactoferrin ( specific granules ) , gelatinase ( gelatinase granules ) , albumin ( se-cretory vesicles '' ) , and HLA ( plasma membranes ) were all measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) as described . ''
Specific granules were also identified by vitamin B ; ; -binding protein as described by Gottlieb et al '' and Kane and Pe-ters .
`` * Secretory vesicles were also identified by latent alkaline phosphatase , ie , alkaline phosphatase only measurable in the presence of detergent ( 0.2 % Triton X-100 ) . > ° Furthermore , fractions were assayed for B , -microglobulin and for the « subunit CD1 1b of Mac-1 , both assessed by ELISA .
* '' ° General procedures for the ELISAs were as described for NGAL ELISA below , except that samples for the CD11b ELISA were solubilized by 25 mmol/L N-octyl glucoside and 0.2 % cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( CTAB ) before further dilution . ''
The content of cytochrome bess was quantitated by dithionite-reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra using an Fig 2 .

- SDS-PAGE protein profile of fractions from Percoll gradient .
Four hundred microliters of fractions containing peak amounts of myeloperoxidase ( lane 1 ) , lactoferrin ( lane 2 ) , gelatinase ( lane 3 ) , and latent alkaline phosphatase/HLA ( lane 4 ) , respectively , was centrifuged in an airfuge to pellet the Percoll .
The biologic material was collected and resuspended in 100 LL of saline .
Sixty-six microliters of the resulting material was mixed with 34 LL of saline and 100 L of Laemmli sample buffer containing mercapto-ethanol .
After boiling for 3 minutes , 150 LL of each fraction was applied to electrophoresis on a 5 % to 20 % gradient gel with a 3 % stacking gel .
The lane marked MW shows molecular weight markers .
Bands that are enriched in gelatinase granules are marked ( * ) on either side in lane 3. ible bands , as previously described . ''
The -band contains azurophil granules , the 8-band specific and gelatinase granules , and the y-band light membrane structures , including secretory vesicles and plasma membranes . ''
The density profile within the 3-band is rather steep.© Introducing a third layer of Percoll with a density of 1.09 g/mL leads to a less-steep density profile ( Fig 1 ) , resulting in generation of 4 visible bands , from the bottom designated the « -band , the 8 ; -band , the 3 ; -band , and the y-band , with the cytosol on top of the Percoll ( Fig 2 ) .
This gradient was fractionated by aspiration from the bottom of the tube into 37 fractions of 1 1645 mL each .
Figure 3A and B shows the distribution profiles of markers for the different compartments of the neutrophil , and Table 1 gives the distribution of these markers in the different regions of the gradient .
The gradient is largely unchanged compared with the two-layer Percoll gradient regarding the content of the a- and the y-band ( Fig 3A and Table 1 ) .
The « -band contains the majority of the azurophil granule marker myeloperoxidase , whereas the y-band contains secretory vesicles identified by latent alkaline phosphatase and plasma membrane identified by HLA .
The characteristic `` shoulder '' in the profile of latent alkaline phosphatase extends into the 3 ; -band ( 21 % of latent alkaline phosphatase activity is contained within the 3 ; -band ; Table 1 ) .
The 8 , -band contains the majority of the specific granule marker lactoferrin ( 83 % ) , whereas the majority of gelatinase is located in the 8 ; -band and in the y-band , which both contain very little lactoferrin ( Fig 3B and Table 1 ) .
We have identified a subpopulation of peroxidase-negative granules that on double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy are positive for gelatinase but lack lactoferrin ; we have defined these as gelatinase granules . '' ''
The remaining peroxidase-negative granules all contain lactoferrin ; although 80 % contain gelatinase as well , these are defined as specific granules .
Thus , a total separation of gelatinase from lactoferrin is impossible because a significant portion of gelatinase resides in lactoferrin-containing granules .
Although there is a gradual transition from specific to gelatinase granules , we here arbitrarily define gelatinase granules as all granules contained in fraction no .
16 and higher , albeit 6 % of lactoferrin is contained within these fractions ( Table 1 ) .
According to this definition , gelatinase granules contain 50.3 % of total cell gelatinase ( 40.0 % in the 8 ; -band , 10.3 % in the y-band ) .
The ultrastructure of the different bands was investigated by electron microscopy .
Figure 4A through D shows electron micrographs of material from the a- , 8 ; - , 8 ; - , and y-band , respectively .
The ultrastructure of the « -band and the y-band is in agreement with previous publications . ''
The ultrastructures of the 8 , - and 8 ; , -bands , respectively , are very similar , because both contain electron-dense rounded granules , although the 8 ; -fraction appears more heterogeneous , possibly because of contamination with light membrane structures .
From morphometric analysis of 84 granules from the 8 , -band and 79 granules from the 8 ; -band , it appears that the B ; , granules are slightly but significantly smaller than the 8 , granules ( average diameter of 8 , granules 187 nm compared with 236 nm of 8 , granules , P < .00001 , two sample [ unpaired ] ) .
This is in agreement with previous findings using double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy on whole cells , which showed gelatinase gran- Fig 6 .

KJELDSEN ET AL ules to be smaller than specific granules . ''
Furthermore , these investigations showed that gelatinase granules comprise approximately 25 % of all peroxidase-negative granules .
This implies that the concentration of gelatinase is much higher in gelatinase granules than in specific granules .
This is also obvious from the SDS-PAGE protein pattern of the different regions of the gradient , as shown in Fig 5 .
In lane 3 , which shows the protein profile of fraction no .
16 , one observes a very intense gelatinase band at 92 kD compared with lane 2 ( specific granules , fraction no .
10 ) .
Apart from gelatinase , two bands at 55 kD and 40 kD are also relatively enriched in the gelatinase granule fraction and may therefore be constituents primarily residing in this granule subset .
The nature of these proteins is not known .
All other proteins visually identified in gelatinase granules are more prominent in either specific granules ( lane 2 ) or light membranes ( lane 4 ) .
The separation of specific granules and gelatinase granules on this three-layer Percoll ] gradient allowed us to rein-vestigate the subcellular localization of different granule proteins previously allocated to specific granules .
From Fig 3C and Table 1 it is observed that another well-established specific granule marker , vitamin B , ,-binding protein , strictly colocalizes with lactoferrin and is therefore a specific granule marker .
We previously published that 8 ; -micro-globulin® '' and NGAL ' both reside in specific granules .
Although NGAL strictly colocalizes with lactoferrin in specific granules , it is apparent from Fig 3C and Table 1 that some $ , -microglobulin is contained within gelatinase granules .
In addition , a third peak of 8 ; -microglobulin in the y-band colocalizes with the plasma membrane marker HLA measured by ELISA .
This is not surprising because this assay measures the HLA-8 , -microglobulin complex . ''
The subcellular localization of the NADPH com-ponent , cytochrome bsss , and the adhesion protein , Mac-1 , is of considerable interest .
Although recent investigations from our laboratory indicate that both proteins are mainly located in the specific granules , these conclusions were hampered by the lack of separation between the profiles of gelatinase and lactoferrin on the Percoll gradient hitherto used . '' ''
From Fig 3D and Table 1 it is observed that the distribution of cytochrome bss & and Mac- !
is quite similar , the majority being located to specific granules ( 61 % and 55 % , respectively ) .
Twenty percent to 25 % is located in gelatinase granules , with the remaining 15 % to 20 % confined to the y-band .
Previous investigations have shown that most of cytochrome bess and Mac-1 , contained within the y-band of unperturbed neutrophils , reside in secretory vesicies .
* '' * '' ' This indicates that there are three reservoirs of both cytochrome bsss and Mac- !
in unstimulated neutrophils , namely , specific granules , gelatinase granules , and secretory vesicles .
It has been demonstrated by several investigators that both Mac-1 and cytochrome bss translocate from internal stores to the plasma membrane on activation of neutro-The contribution of the different granule/vesi-cle subsets to the upregulation of cytochrome bss ; and Mac-1 in the plasma membrane on stimulation can now be investigated by subcellular fractionation of neutrophils From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

GELATINASE GRANULES IN HUMAN NEUTROPHILS stimulated with various secretagogues .
Figure 6 and Table 2 show the distribution of myeloperoxidase , lactoferrin , gelatinase , albumin ( a matrix marker for secretory vesicles ) , cytochrome bs53 , Mac-1 , and HLA in control cells and in cells stimulated with 10 nmol/L FMLP or 2 ug/mL PMA before subcellular fractionation .
It is evident that stimulation of neutrophils with FMLP hardly mobilizes any specific granules ( release of 2.2 % of lactoferrin ) , whereas 26 % of gelatinase is exocytosed .
It is observed that gelatinase is selectively depleted from the lightest peroxidase-negative granules , ie , gelatinase granules residing in the 3 ; , -band ( reduced from 40 % to 18.7 % ) and in the y-band ( reduced from 10.3 % to 4.3 % ) .
Likewise , the content of both cytochrome bss and Mac-1 in the 8 ; -band is reduced from 22 % and 25 % to 7.1 % and 9.2 % , respectively , with a parallel increase in the y-band content of these two proteins .
Furthermore , as previously shown , '' a translocation of cytochrome bss3 and Mac-1 occurs within the y-band from secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane , because secretory vesicles are almost fully mobilized on stimulation with FMLP ( as visualized by disappearance of albumin after FMLP stimulation ; Fig 6 ) .
This translocation to the plasma membrane of approximately 15 % of total cell cytochrome bss and Mac-1 is overlooked if one only focuses on the total content of these proteins in the y-band .
On stimulation with PMA , one observes a further upregulation of cytochrome bss3 and Mac-1 in the plasma membrane , with the major contribution coming from specific granules ( Fig 6 and Table 2 ) .
In contrast to gelatinase granules , specific granules are not fully mobilized on stimulation with PMA , because 34 % of lactoferrin remains in the # , -band .
DISCUSSION We describe here a novel method for subcellular fractionation of human neutrophils on three-layer Percoll density gradients .
In contrast to previous fractionation protocols , this protocol offers separation of all established secretory organelles of the neutrophil , in particular , separation of gelatinase granules from specific ( lactoferrin containing ) granules .
The present results are very much in line with our data obtained by double-labeling immunogold electron micros-copy '' '' and with the findings of Graves et al '' '' and Jones et al ' and confirms the recent assumptions of the existence of heterogeneity among peroxidase-negative granules .
These granules constitute a continuum from granules rich in lactoferrin and vitamin B ; ; -binding protein but devoid of gelatinase and scarcely mobilized by inflammatory mediators to granules rich in gelatinase but devoid of lactoferrin or vitamin B ; , -binding protein and responsive to stimulation of the cells by inflammatory mediators .
These latter granules , the gelatinase granules ( equivalent to `` specific granules containing gelatinase but lacking vitamin B , ; -binding protein , '' as designated by Graves et al '' '' ) , should therefore be considered a subpopulation of peroxidase-negative granules .
They contain approximately 50 % of total cell gelatinase , with the remaining 50 % being localized together with lactoferrin in specific granules .
It should be stressed that we reserve the term specific granules for peroxidase-negative granules containing lactoferrin and vitamin B , ; , -binding protein .
1647 The separation of gelatinase granules from specific granules enables us to estimate the relative distribution within peroxidase-negative granule subpopulations of both Mac-1 and cytochrome whose subcellular localizations have been a matter of debate during recent years .
It was con-cluded , based on colocalization with lactoferrin in double-labeling immunogold electron microscopy , that specific granules were the intracellular reservoir of leukocyte adhesion receptors ( including Mac-1 '' ' ) and cytochrome bsss . ''
On the other hand , Mollinedo et al claimed both Mac-1 and cytochrome bess to be located mainly within gelatinase gran-ules .
* '' We find the two proteins to be located in both specific and gelatinase granules , but find only 20 % to 25 % of Mac-1 and cytochrome bss residing in gelatinase granules , whereas the majority ( 55 % and 61 % ) is located in specific granules .
The localization of Mac- !
in both specific and gelatinase granules is in line with the results obtained by Jones et al `` * and Graves et al , '' although they found less Mac-1 in specific granules ( 32 % and 26 % , respectively ) and more in gelatinase granules ( 35 % and 44 % , respectively ) .
Furthermore , the fact that the majority of Mac-1 within the y-band of unperturbed cells is not located in the plasma membrane but rather in secretory vesicles '' was not considered in those studies .
The quantitative differences in distribution of Mac-1 within peroxidase-negative granules may be caused by the use of different solubilization procedures .
Only after including n-octyl glucoside and CTAB in the solubilization protocol in the CD1 1b ELISA were we able to measure all Mac- !
present in specific granules. > The heterogeneity within peroxidase-negative granules may reflect differential but overlapping synthesis and packaging of different granule proteins during granulopoiesis .
Ultrastructural studies on neutrophil precursors have indicated that lactoferrin is synthesized and packaged at the early myelocytic stage preceding the packaging of gela-tinase . ' ''
Although hypothetical , it is possible that the synthesis of gelatinase continues after lactoferrin synthesis has ceased .
The content of different peroxidase-negative granules could therefore simply reflect the actual proteins that are synthesized at the time of granule formation .
Furthermore , the possibility exists that a constant synthesis of both Mac-1 and cytochrome bss ; occurs during the time of specific granule formation and later during gelatinase granule formation .
This would result in an equal density of cyto-crome bess and Mac-1 in the membrane of gelatinase granules and specific granules , respectively , but given the lower number and smaller size/surface of gelatinase granules , the total content of these two proteins will be much less in these granules than in specific granules .
The biologic significance of storing Mac- and cytochrome bsss in three different secretory organelles is very intriguing .
We have recently shown that a strict hierarchy exists regarding both calcium sensitivity and kinetics of mobilization of the different organelles within the neutrophil . ''
Secretory vesicles are mobilized faster and at lower cytosolic Ca*+* levels than gelatinase granules , which again are mobilized faster and at lower cytosolic Ca** levels than specific granules .
This could imply that secretory vesicles are rapidly exocytosed , as the neutrophil reaches inflamed endothe- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

1648 lium , leading to upregulation of surface Mac-1 and subsequent firm adhesion of the cell .
Later , in the inflammatory response , a further upregulation of Mac- !
from gelatinase granules ensures a persistent firm attachment of the neutro-phil , '' with a concomitant secretion of gelatinase , allowing the cell to traverse the basement membrane of the endothe-lium .
The parallel partial translocation of cytochrome bss3 and subsequent activation of the NADPH-oxidase could be of importance in activation of latent gelatinase before dia-pedesis , '' '' and could mediate expression of ICAM-1 on the surface of the endothelial cells . ''
Considering the harmful effects to the host of reactive oxygen species , it seems reasonable to store the majority of cytochrome bss in specific granules , because specific granules are unlikely to be mobilized by weak stimuli involved in neutrophil adhesion and diapedesis .
The use of the three-layer Percoll density gradient presented here makes it possible to further characterize the structure and content of gelatinase granules with the potential of elucidating the mechanisms underlying the graded exoytosis of peroxidase-negative granule subpopulations .
