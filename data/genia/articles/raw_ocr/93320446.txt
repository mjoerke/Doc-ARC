Antisense Oligonucleotides to the p65 Subunit of NF- « B Block CD11b Expression and Alter Adhesion Properties of Differentiated HL-60 Granulocytes By John A. Sokoloski , Alan C. Sartorelli , Craig A. Rosen , and Ramaswamy Narayanan NF- « B is a pleiotropic regulator of a variety of genes implicated in the cellular response to injury .
This function has been attributed to the coordinated binding of subunits of NF- « B to distinct regions of the promoter elements of numerous genes , including cytokines , growth factor receptors , and adhesion molecules .
Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF- « B complex were used to define the physiologic role of this transcription factor in resting and stimulated granulocytes .
A reduction in the expression of p65 was produced by treatment with the phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxy-nucleotide .
This reduction was accompanied by rapid changes in the cellular adhesion of dimethyl sulfoxide-dif- HE NF- « B TRANSCRIPTION factor complex is a pleiotropic activator that participates in the induction of numerous cellular and viral genes , including the Ig « , the interleukin-2 receptor a chain , and human immunodeficiency virus I . ' ''
The NF- « B subunits , p50 and p65 , are members of a rapidly growing class of transcription factors that have unique amino terminal DNA binding and dimer-ization domains .
* '' The genes encoding p50° and p65*~ have recently been cloned , and the amino termini .
of both proteins have been shown to have considerable homology with the re/ oncogene product .
The re/ oncogene , originally described as the avian retrovirus Rev T , causes lymphoid cell tumors in birds .
* NF- « B also has homology with the dorsal gene product of Drosophila melanogaster . ''
Recently , we provided evidence that the p65 subunit is a potent transcriptional activator in the absence of the p50 subunit . ' ''
More specifically , domains in p65 that lie close to the domain that specifies DNA binding may affect the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with p50 as well as DNA binding .
Thus , p65 may interact with certain domains of its own and/or require the presence of p50 to interact with other elements .
This is consistent with the observation that p50 and p65 have different affinities for specific kB motifs , implying that different motifs are important for the selective regulation of gene expression by NF- « B .
Neutrophils ( polymorphonuclear leukocytes ) , which represent 70 % of circulating leukocytes , are terminally differentiated phagocytic cells .
The body 's first line of defense in protecting the host against invading microorganisms , neutrophils also play a role in the pathogenesis of immunologi-cally induced tissue damage .
Activated neutrophils can perform a variety of specialized cellular functions , including cellular adhesion , aggregation , chemotaxis , phagocytosis , the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites , and the secretion of enzymes such as myeloperoxidase and lysozyme , which are located in granules . ''
Within minutes of stimulation by a wide range of activators and chemotactic factors , circulating neutrophils attach to the endothelial wall of the blood vessel at the site of infection .
Neutrophils then migrate out of the bloodstream into the tissue , and degranulate readily , releasing a host of defensive antimicrobial prod-ucts . ''
The ability of neutrophils to attach to the wall of the blood vessel is a critical component of the host defense Blood , Vol 82 , No 2 ( July 15 ) , 1993 : pp 625-632 ferentiated HL-60 leukemia cells stimulated by 1 2-0-tetra-decanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) .
These effects were characterized by a marked reduction in CD11b integrin expression on the surface of treated cells .
Furthermore , the p65 antisense oligomer effectively abolished an upregulation of CD11b that was produced by formyl-met-leu-phe and TPA .
However , the p65 antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide had no significant effect on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates or on phagocytosis by these cells .
These findings indicate that antisense oligomers to p65 can be used to define the role of NF- « B in the activation pathways of neutrophils .

mechanism ; therefore , defects in neutrophil adhesion and migration can lead to recurrent , life-threatening infec-tions . ''
Neutrophils also play a significant role in the damage to host tissue that occurs in disorders such as rheuma-toid arthritis , myocardial reperfusion damage , and respiratory distress syndrome .
'* '' '' Thus , novel anti-inflam-matory agents able to block neutrophil activation may offer therapeutic benefits in the treatment of conditions in which an unregulated neutrophil response is implicated in the mechanism of tissue destruction .
In a previous study , we showed that antisense oligonucleotides to the p50 and p65 subunits of NF- « B elicit differential effects on cellular adhesion , a property dependent on the stage of differentiation . ''
Because several cell adhesion molecules have been shown to have NF- « B binding sites , '* '' '' we reasoned that the antisense oligomer-mediated inhibition of cellular adhesion was caused by inhibition of the synthesis of one or more of these adhesion molecules .
In the present study , we used differentiated HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells as a model of granulocytic maturation to show that an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the p65 subunit of NF- « B has a profound effect on cell attachment and on the production of important cell surface adhesion molecules .

626 MATERIALS AND METHODS Antisense oligonucleotides .
- The antisense and sense phosphorothioate analogs of oligonucleotides to the 5 end of the different subunits of NF- « B , including the ATG initiation codon ( 21-24 mer ) , were synthesized using an automated synthesizer ( Model 394 ; Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) according to the procedure of Matsukura et al '' '' ( Table 1 ) .
Oligomers were purified as previously described '' with the modification that oligomers were routinely re-extracted six times with ether before washing with absolute ethanol .
Stock solutions were made in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at a concentration of 14 mg/mL and frozen in small aliquots .
Cell culture .
- HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were provided by Dr Robert C. Gallo ( National Cancer Institute , Be-thesda , MD ) .
Cells were routinely propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 15 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum .
For all experiments and passages , cells were seeded at 5 to 10 x 10° cells/ mL and incubated in a 5 % CO ; -95 % air humidified incubator maintained at 37°C .
Passaged cells were maintained in exponential growth and were not used beyond passage 60 .
Cell numbers were measured using a Coulter ZBI particle counter with a multichannel analyzer ( Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) .
Cells were routinely screened for mycoplasma infection .
Granulocytic - maturation .

After induction of differentiation by exposure to 1.3 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) for 7 days , aliquots of cells were mixed with 40 gmol/L oligomer and placed in 24-well plates for various periods of time .
All experiments were performed in 24-well plates to minimize the consumption of oligodeoxynucleotides .
In some experiments , phosphorothioates were added to cells at different times after the addition of inducer , before attainment of the differentiated pheno-type .
Except as noted , all experiments were repeated at least four times with independent preparations of thiolated oligomers , with similar results .
The expression of CD1 1b ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) was used as a marker of mature myeloid cells .
Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated antibody for 30 minutes on ice , washed with PBS , and fixed in PBS containing 3.7 % formaldehyde ; CD1 1b fluorescence intensity was then measured using flow cytometry .
The production of hydrogen peroxide was measured by the dichlorofluorescein ( DCF ) assay as previously described . ''
Cells were treated with phosphorothioate for 6 hours , and then incubated with 5 umol/L dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( DCFH , -DA ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for 1 5 minutes , followed by 1 amol/L 12-0-tet-radecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) for an additional 15 minutes .
DCF fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry .
The ability of cells to phagocytize beads was monitored by the procedure of Blair et al . '' ''

RESULTS In a previous report , '' we showed that antisense oligonucleotides complementary to p50 and p65 of NF- « B had differential effects on the adhesion of a variety of cell types .
These findings suggested that NF- « B subunits , either as homodimers or heterodimers , are capable of regulating the synthesis of integrin-like molecules in cells .
To explore this possibility further , we used HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia as a model of granulocytic differentiation , because the differentiation of these cells into granulocyte-like forms is associated with the development of a complex pattern of cellular adhesion that is modulated by changes in integrin synthesis .
Modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to p50 , p65 , and the inhibitory IkB subunit of NF- « B were synthesized ( Table 1 ) .
Exposure of undifferentiated HL-60 leukemia cells to these oligomers had no significant effect on cell growth or differentiation ; however , the p65 antisense oligomer caused a marked alteration in the phenotype of HL-60 cells that had been induced by DMSO to differentiate ( Fig 1 ) .
In the absence of TPA , differentiated HL-60 cells did not attach to the plastic surface ( data not shown ) , but in the presence of TPA , differentiated HL-60 cells rapidly adhered to the plastic dishes in a process that was accompanied by a marked spreading of the cell surface .
Exposure of p65 anti-sense-treated cells to TPA resulted in a pronounced alteration of these adhesive properties ( Fig 1D ) .
In contrast , cells exposed to the p65 oligomer in the sense configuration ( Fig 1C ) or to either the sense ( Fig 1A ) or antisense ( Fig 1B ) configuration of p50 and IkB oligomers ( data not shown ) responded to TPA treatment in a manner analogous to that of control cells not exposed to a phosphorothioate .
The effects of oligomer treatment of HL-60 cells on the expression of p50 and p65 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR ( Fig 2 ) .
The p65 antisense phosphorothioate oligomer abolished p65 mRNA expression in differentiated HL-60 cells , but did not affect the expression of p50 or of GAPDH , From www .

NF- « B AND CELL ADHESION Fig 1 .
The effects of antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide to p65 on the spreading of differentiated HL-60 cells after treatment with TPA .
HL-60 cells that acquired a differentiated phenotype after exposure to DMSO by methodology described in Materials and Methods were mixed with 40 umol/L of oligomer in the sense and antisense configurations ( oligomers to p50 and to p65 ) in a 24-well culture dish , and were incubated for 8 hours .
Aliquots were removed , incubated for an additional 60 minutes in the presence of 1 ug/ml of 627 ANTISENSE TPA , and photographed .
a housekeeping gene .
Similarly , the p50 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide completely abolished p50 mRNA expression , whereas p65 and GAPDH mRNAs were not affected .
These findings suggest that the effects of the p65 antisense oligonucleotide on cellular aggregation and on TPA-me-diated adhesion of differentiated HL-60 cells were caused by the selective inhibition of p65 mRNA expression .
Addition-ally , the results indicate that the effects , if any , of the p50 antisense molecule in granulocyte-like HL-60 cells remain to be defined .
Treatment with the p65 antisense oligomer did not affect the viability of the cells , as ascertained by trypan blue exclu-sion , for at least 48 hours after exposure , or alter the morphology characteristic of differentiated granulocytes .
The p65 phosphorothioate oligomer in the antisense configuration also did not significantly impair the ability of these cells to phagocytize latex beads ( Fig 3A ) or to produce hydrogen peroxide ( Fig 3B ) or superoxide ( data not shown ) .
The effects of the p65 antisense oligomer were transient ; thus , when cells were replated in the absence of oligomer for 4 hours , they regained the capacity to spread on the plastic substratum after stimulation of attachment by TPA .
These findings implied that the effects of the p65 antisense molecule on differentiated HL-60 cells were the result of specific alterations in cellular adhesion properties and not a consequence of the toxicity of this oligodeoxynucleotide or of changes in the differentiative or proliferative status of the cells .
To determine if the changes induced by the p65 antisense oligomer in the adhesion and spreading of differentiated HL-60 cells after exposure to TPA were caused by alterations in the expression of integrin molecules on the cell surface , we monitored the effects of these phosphoro- thioates on expression of the a2 subunit of integrin ( CD11b/Mo 1 ) in differentiated HL-60 cells .
Exposure to the p65 antisense oligonucleotide for 6 hours caused a marked reduction in the expression of CD1 1b ( Fig 4 ) .
This inhibitory action was detectable within 2 hours and was retained for at least 18 hours ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , exposure to the p65 oligomer in the sense configuration did not alter the expression of CD1 1b .
Furthermore , neither p50 nor IkB antisense molecules , or their respective phosphorothioates in the sense orientation , had a significant effect on CD11b integrin expression ( Fig 4 ) .
These results suggest that the p65 subunit of NF- « B maintains a specific function in granulocyte-like cells , and is essential for the expression of CD1 1 b and possibly that of other mediators of cell attachment and migration .
Stimulation of differentiated HL-60 cells by the chemotactic factor formyl-met-leu-phe ( fMLP ) or by TPA has been shown to cause an upregulation of the expression of CD1 1b on the surface of granulocytes .
To determine if the p65 antisense oligomer alters this process , we exposed differentiated HL-60 cells that had been treated either with the sense or antisense configuration of phosphorothioate oligomers to fMLP or TPA for 30 minutes and then measured the expression of CD1 1b .
As shown in Fig 5 , exposure to fMLP and TPA caused an increase in the expression of CD1 1b , presumably representing the release of intracellular stores of this molecule .
The upregulation of CD1 1b on the cell surface these factors produced was blocked in p65 anti-sense-treated cells , whereas the stimulation of CD11b expression by fMLP or TPA was unaffected in cells exposed to the p65 oligonucleotide in the sense configuration .
Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to p50 and IkB in either the sense or antisense form also did not significantly alter From www .

The effects of p65 antisense molecules were concentration dependent , because levels of the p65 antisense oligomer lower than 10 mol/L had little effect on the stimulation of CD1 1b expression by fMLP , whereas concentrations of this oligonucleotide greater than 20 amol/L significantly inhibited CD1 1b expression .
Furthermore , the expression of CD1 1b was partially restored in cells washed free of the p65 antisense oligomer and incubated in fresh , oligonucleotide-free medium for 4 hours .
We next investigated whether the block of CD1 1b expression at the cell surface is caused by inhibition of CD1 1b mRNA expression ( Fig 6 ) .

The DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells showed significant expression of CD1 1b mRNA .
Treatment of DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells with either the sense or antisense p65 SOKOLOSKI ET AL oligomers did not inhibit CD11b mRNA expression , suggesting that the block of CD1 1b surface expression is not caused by inhibition of gene expression .
DISCUSSION The studies described in this report were undertaken to gain information on the function of the individual subunits of the NF- « B transcription factor complex in granulocytes .
Our previous studies had shown that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to the p50 and p65 subunits of NF- « B had differential effects on adhesion in a variety of cell lines . '' ''
As an approach to investigate this phenomenon further , we used HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia , a bipotential cell line that can be induced to differentiate into both granulocyte-like and monocyte-like cells by a variety of chemical agents , including DMSO .
Thus , HL-60 cells offer several advantages for studies on the role of NF- « B on cellular growth and differentiation .

Neutrophils attach to the endothelial cells of blood vessels before leaving the bloodstream at sites of inflammation .
The extravasation of these cells requires several different adhesion proteins that function in a multistep adhesion cas-cade .
The initial events occur as leukocytes roll along the vessel wall and are mediated by the selectin family of adhesion receptors . '' ''
Although rolling on the blood vessel wall is necessary for adhesion , it is not by itself sufficient .
These adhesion processes require the presence of other integrins , such as the 32 integrins in leukocytes . '' ''
The 82 integrins are inactive on circulating leukocytes and can be activated by phorbol esters or more physiologically by a variety of inflammatory stimuli produced by the endothelium or underlying inflamed tissue , such as chemotactic peptides , tumor necrosis factor , CSa , or platelet-activating factor . '' ''
Recently , it has become evident that the integrins are not simply adhesion sites on the cell surface , but may modulate a number of cellular processes as important molecules in signal transduction pathways .
In addition to mediating cellular adhesion and motility , the interactions of integrins with the extracellular matrix proteins play an important role in a number of other important cellular processes , including the activation and gene expression of fibroblasts , '' '' mono-cytes , '' and T lymphocytes '' ; and tyrosine phosphorylation triggered by integrin has been described in NIH 3T 3 cells . ''
For example , adherence of monocytes to the extracellular matrix induces genes encoding several inflammation media-tors . ''
Adherence of neutrophils through 3 integrins has been shown to costimulate the respiratory burst that occurs with cytokines . ''
These results suggest that the integrins may be part of the signal pathways that include growth factors , receptors , and tyrosine kinase oncogene products .
They also suggest a mechanism for the anchorage depen- 629 dence of normal growing cells and its loss in transformed cells . ''
Through these functions the integrins may play an important role in both development and the adult organ-ism .
Although the p50 and p65 subunits of NF- « B can form heterodimers , several lines of evidence suggest that these molecules may also function as homodimers , or alternatively , as heterodimers with other proteins that are presently unknown . ''
Furthermore , in resting cells NF- « B is believed to exist in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with the inhibitory protein IkB.3 ' We have recently shown that a naturally occurring spliced variant of p65 , termed p6SA , A Relative Fluorescence Intensity CONT P5OS P50 AS P6SS P65SAS IkKBS IkKB AS 16 B P & 2 o § 121 O o ( = 3 g 0.8 0 3 m g : 0.41 3 `` D A 0.0 0 20 10 5.0 2.0 P65 ( uM ) Fig 5 .

630 which lacks a functional activation domain , can elicit changes in cell growth and cause focus formation , anchor-age-independent growth in soft agar , and tumor formation in athymic nude mice . ''
In our most recent studies , we have observed that inhibition of p65 expression in diverse tumor-derived cell lines by p65 antisense oligomers blocks cell adhesion in vitro and growth in vivo . ''
These findings suggest that p65 may regulate the transcription of a set of genes essential for transformation .
To determine whether reduced expression of NF- « B would prevent the attachment of neutrophils , we incubated HL-60 cells in DMSO under conditions that caused them to terminally differentiate , and then treated these cells with antisense oligonucleotides of p50 , p65 , and IkB .
The treatment of differentiated HL-60 cells with an oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to the p65 subunit of NF- « B resulted in a marked reduction in cell spreading that followed a short period of exposure to TPA .
Treatment of differentiated HL-60 cells with the p65 antisense oligomer also resulted in a significant reduction in the level of the CD11b marker on the cell surface , which was associated with a pronounced inhibition of the recruitment of additional CD1 1b molecules to the surface from stored vesicles on stimulation of these cells by fMLP or TPA .
These effects occurred within 2 hours and depended on the state of differentiation of the cells , because undifferentiated HL-60 cells were not affected by the p65 antisense oligonucleotide .
Differentiated HL-60 cells treated with p65 antisense molecules were viable and retained the ability to respond to treatment with TPA when the cells were washed free of the oligomer .
In addition , the ability of cells to undergo phagocytosis and produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide was not affected by treatment with the p65 phosphorothioate in the antisense configuration .
This finding suggests that these phenotypic markers of the differentiated granulocyte and the expression of CD1 1b and TPA-induced cell spreading after attachment are under separate genomic control .
In agreement with earlier find-ings , '' * '' > we observed no expression of CD1 1b mRNA in the undifferentiated HL-60 cells ; however , differentiated HL-60 cells exposed to p65 antisense oligomers showed no inhibition of CD1 1b mRNA expression .

because the CD1 1b promoter sequence does not encode the putative NF- « B binding site . '' ''
These results suggest that p65 antisense oligomers may be blocking transcription of some factor ( s ) important for the release of intracellular granules containing preformed CD1 1b .
Alternatively , p65 antisense oligomers may be affecting the release of CD1 1b from the granules by nontranscriptional mechanisms .
Interference with the expression of p50 mRNA by the p50 antisense oligomer in differentiated HL-60 cells had no significant effect on cellular attachment or on the expression of CD11b .
At present , it is not clear why the decrease in the steady-state levels of p50 mRNA did not result in any measurable effects in these cells .
It is possible that p65 may function with some additional unknown factor of the NF « B complex as a heterodimer in these cells , or that p50 may possibly behave as a homodimer .
Because we were able to observe the presence of p50 mRNA in differentiated HL-60 cells and show the subsequent inhibition of its expression by treatment of these cells with a p50 antisense oligomer , it is possible that p50 may regulate functions not yet known to be associated with cell attachment in granulocytes , possibly through the production of cytokines or other growth factors .
As our studies used cellular adhesion to a plastic surface as a model for NF- « B function , we can not provide evidence that supports other possible functions of the p50 subunit of NF-kB .
An obvious question that arises from these studies is how antisense oligomers to p65 regulate NF- « B function .
Does the loss of p65 have a direct inhibitory role on the function of NF- « B in promoting gene expression , or alternatively , does the loss of p65 indirectly result in the imbalancing of some other yet undefined factor ?
We speculate that a decrease in the concentration of p65 may disrupt the function of NF- « B by inhibiting the induction of subtle changes in the ratio of homodimers or heterodimers of NF- « B that are essential for normal cellular function .
For example , the loss of p65 may affect the regulation of gene transcription by a p65 homodimeric complex , or may act indirectly by limiting the availability of p65 for the formation of p65-p50 het-erodimeric complexes .

NF- « B AND CELL ADHESION intracellular signals through a single protein complex to the DNA , which in turn triggers a unified response . '' ''
Diverse agents seem to communicate with the NF- « B complex through membrane receptors and second messenger systems activated by these receptors .
In this context , there are many inducible genes with NF- « B binding motifs wherein the factor may play a role in transcriptional activation .
One common denominator of NF- « xB-controlled genes is the involvement of the encoded genes in inflammatory and other acute-phase responses . ''
Many if not all of the target genes of NF- « B encode for immunoreceptor molecules , such as the integrins , cytokines , and other acute-phase proteins .
Thus , induction of these many specialized proteins by NF-xB may constitute a set of cellular responses to pathogenic signals or injuries that result in the activation of a number of cellular genes encoding defense proteins . ''
Another characteristic common to these target genes is their rapid induc-tion , evidenced in NF- « B by the presence of cytoplasmic precursors of the activating complex , its simple dissociation from the inactive complex , and the lack of requirement for new protein synthesis .
The findings presented in this report identify the p65 subunit of NF- « B as a key component in the activation pathway of neutrophils stimulated by fMLP and TPA , and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that NF- « B is an important element in the production of cellular molecules essential for the host defense mechanism .
