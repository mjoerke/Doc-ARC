B cells derived from patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( X-SCID ) are deficient in y , and provide a useful model in which to dissect the role of this subunit in IL-4-mediated signaling .
We found that although IL-4 stimulation of X-SCID B cells did not result in Janus tyrosine kinase-3 ( JAK3 ) phosphorylation , other IL-4 substrates including JAK1 and IRS-1 were phosphorylated .
Additionally , we detected signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 ( STAT6 ) tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity in X-SCID B cells with a wide range of y , mutations .
However , reconstitution of these X-SCID B cells with y , , enhanced IL-4-mediated responses including STAT6G phosphorylation and DNA binding activity and resulted in increased CD23 expression .
Thus , y , is not necessary to trigger IL-4-mediated responses in B cells , but its presence is important for optimal IL-4-sig-naling .
These results suggest that two distinct IL-4 signaling pathways exist .
Patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( X-SCID ) ' present with very few T cells and absent mitogenic responses ( 1 ) .
Although B cells are present , immunoglobulin levels are low , and specific antibody production is lacking .
The combination of these defects is fatal by 1-2 years of age unless the immune system is reconstituted by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation .

78314 wide range of mutations in the common gamma chain ( y , ) gene that result in either a lack of y , message , unstable y , proteins that are poorly expressed , or defective y , receptor subunits that are expressed but nonfunctional ( 2-4 ) .
y , was originally identified as a component of the IL-2 cytokine receptor ( IL-2Ry ) , but as it has been shown to be shared by receptors for IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 , it is now designated y , , ( 5-9 ) .
IL-4 is thought to be important for mature B cell functions including immunoglobulin class switching to IgG4 and IgE as well as expression of CD23 and major histocompatibility complex class II genes ( 10 ) .
Because IL-4 regulates B lymphocyte function , it is important to determine the response of X-SCID B cells to this cytokine .
The functional IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) consists of at least two components , IL-4Ra and y , , subunits ( 6 , 11 ) .
Signal transduction through the IL-4R , as well as through other hematopoietic receptors , is initiated by activation of Janus family tyrosine kinases ( JAKs ) ( 12 , 13 ) .
IL-4 elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK family members JAK1 and JAK3 , which interact with the IL-4Ra and y , subunits , respectively ( 14-17 ) .
The current model of cytokine signaling proposes that upon cytokine binding , members of the JAK family are rapidly activated and subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylate the receptor , forming a docking site for signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) that are also phosphorylated by JAKs ( 12 , 13 ) .
The STAT proteins then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind DNA sequences on target genes .
One important STAT that is activated in response to IL-4 , STAT6 ( IL-4 STAT ) , has been shown to bind to promoter sequences of IL-4-inducible genes ( 18-21 ) .
As STAT6 knockout animals parallel the IL-4 null phenotype and exhibit defects in Th2 helper T cell differentiation and immunoglobulin class switching ( 22-24 ) , STAT6 appears to be essential for many IL-4-mediated effects .
It might be predicted that in the absence of a functional y , chain , X-SCID B cells would not be able to respond to IL-4 .
Indeed , two groups have reported that neither JAK1 phosphorylation nor STAT6 DNA binding activity is induced upon IL-4 stimulation of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells ( B-LCL ) derived from X-SCID patients ( 25 , 26 ) .
However , Matthews and colleagues ( 27 ) have recently demonstrated that although X-SCID B cells can not undergo immunoglobulin class switching , they can proliferate in vitro in response to IL-4 when co-stimulated with CD40 ligand or anti-IgM .
Although the underlying biochemical mechanisms are not clear , these data suggest that IL-4-mediated signaling in X-SCID B cells can occur .
It was therefore important to analyze IL-4-signaling in a panel of B-LCL derived from X-SCID patients with a wide range of y , mutations in order to clarify these discrepancies .

IL-4 also induced STAT6 phosphorylation as well as DNA binding activity in these cells .
However , STAT6 activation and CD23 expression were significantly enhanced in X-SCID B-LCL reconstituted with wild type y , .
Thus , we have demonstrated a 7. , -JAK83-independent pathway through which IL-4 activates JAK1 and STAT6 in B cells derived from X-SCID patients .
These results have important implications for the understanding of IL-4 signal transduction and the lack of mature B cell function in patients with X-SCID .

STAT6 phosphorylation is enhanced following y , reconstitution of an X-SCID B-LCL .
Immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-STAT6 antibody was performed on lysates from a control ( normal ) , X-SCID B-LCL ( eDNA468+1 ) , and the same X-SCID B-LCL reconstituted with y , ( XSCID+y , ) following either no stimulation ( - ) or stimulation with IL-4 ( + ) .
Immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies ( upper panel ! )
and reprobed with an anti-STAT6 antibody ( lower panel ) .
RESULTS JAK1 and IRS-1 , but Not JAK3 , Are Phosphorylated following IL-4 Stimulation of X-SCID B-LCL-In order to investigate whether there is any y , -independent cytokine-mediated signal transduction in X-SCID B cells , we assessed the phosphorylation of the major intermediates determined to be involved in IL-4 signaling .
JAK3 associates with the shared y , subunit of the IL-2 and IL-4 receptors and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon addition of either cytokine ( 14-17 ) .
We therefore analyzed JAK3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-2 and IL-4 stimulation in Epstein-Barr virus- transformed X-SCID B-LCL with heterogeneous y , mutations .
Although JAK3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon both IL-2 and IL-4 stimulation of a control B-LCL and the HUT78 T cell line , we did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 following IL-2 or IL-4 stimulation of any of the X-SCID B-LCLs ( Fig .
14 , upper panel ) .
Equivalent levels of immunoprecipitated JAK3 could be demonstrated in each lane by immunoblotting the same filter with a polyclonal anti-JAK3 antibody ( Fig .
14 , lower panel ) .
These data indicate that JAK3 is not phosphorylated following IL-2 or IL-4 stimulation of X-SCID B-LCL with a diversity of y , mutations ( 28 , 29 , Fig .
1 ) .
JAK1 constitutively associates with the IL-2R§ and IL-4Ra subunits of the IL-2 and IL-4 receptors , respectively , and is phosphorylated upon receptor stimulation ( 14 , 16 , 34 ) .
It might be predicted that in the absence of JAK3 phosphorylation , JAK1 would not be phosphorylated in response to IL-2 or IL-4 in X-SCID B-LCL .
In fact , JAK1 was not phosphorylated in any of the X-SCID B-LCLs tested following the addition of IL-2 ( Fig .
1B , upper panel ) .
However , treatment with IL-4 resulted in JAK1 phosphorylation in all X-SCID B-LCLs .
It is of interest to note that the phosphorylation of JAK1 was observed irrespective of the presence of a y , subunit on the surface of the 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog IL-4 Signaling in X-SCID B Cells Normal X-SCID 7317 x-SCID/ye Number Cell Fluorescence Intensity Fig .

Modulation of CD23 cell surface expression by IL-4 .
Normal , X-SCID , and y -reconstituted B cells were treated with or without IL-4 in serum-free conditions for 48 h. CD23 expression was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described .
Expression in untreated and IL-4-stimulated cells are shown as open and closed histograms , respectively .
The mean fluorescence intensity of CD23 on the cell surface , with or without IL-4 stimulation , was analyzed with Cellquest software ( Becton-Dickinson ) .
The mean fluorescence intensity in the normal , X-SCID , and y , reconstituted X-SCID B-LCL increased by 1.98 ( 170.836 to 330.09 ) , 1.00 ( 188.45 to 181.76 ) , and 1.48 ( 282.56 to 344.91 ) -fold , respectively .
Results are representative of data from four independent experiments .
X-SCID B-LCL .
These results demonstrate that JAK1 is activated by an IL-4-responsive pathway in X-SCID B-LCL which is independent of y , and JAK3 .
The large cytosolic docking molecule IRS-1 is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-4 and has been hypothesized to be important for an IL-4-mediated proliferative response ( 35 , 36 ) .
We therefore examined the effects of IL-4 on IRS-1 phosphorylation in X-SCID B cells .
Following immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies , we detected IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in both B-LCL from a normal donor and a patient with X-SCID ( Fig .
1C ) .
Thus , y , expression is not required for IL-4-mediated IRS-1 phosphorylation .
IL-4 and IL-13 Induce STAT6 Phosphorylation and Activation in X-SCID B-LCL-Stimulation of many cell types with IL-4 leads to the phosphorylation of STAT6 ( 87 ) .
As JAKB3 was not phosphorylated in X-SCID B cells , it was important to determine whether IL-4-mediated STAT6 phosphorylation would also be affected by the loss of y , , .
Previous data indicated that IL-13 , which shares many structural and functional characteristics with IL-4 ( 38-40 ) , but not IL-4 itself , induced STAT6 activation in X-SCID B-LCL ( 25 ) .
However , we found that STAT6 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon both IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation in every X-SCID B-LCL ( Fig .
24 ) .
Nevertheless , the IL-4-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT6 was significantly greater in control B-LCL than in all X-SCID B-LCL tested ( Figs .
2A and 3 ) .
In contrast , the IL-13-mediated stimulation of STAT6 was roughly equivalent among the control and X-SCID B-LCLs .
We also found that IL-4 stimulated DNA binding activity in control and X-SCID B-LCL as assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( Fig .
2B ) .
Since IL-4 is known to induce the expression of CD23 in B cells ( 41 ) , we assessed DNA binding activity with a probe corresponding to the interferon-y activation sequence ( GAS ) element in the CD23 promoter ( 42 ) .
As shown in Fig .
2B , gel-retarded CD23 GAS element-binding complexes were formed following IL-4 stimulation of both a control B-LCL as well as an X-SCID B-LCL ( cDNA468+1 ) .
However , as might be expected from our finding that STAT6 was phosphorylated at lower levels in IL-4-stimulated X-SCID B-LCL as compared with control B-LCL ( Fig .
24 ) , IL-4-induced DNA binding activity was significantly lower in all X-SCID B-LCL than in control B-LCL ( Fig .
2B and data not shown ) .
To ascertain whether the DNA binding complexes contained STAT6 , we performed supershift analyses using STAT6 anti-sera .
In each of the IL-4-induced DNA binding complexes , a supershift was detected using STAT6 antisera but not with a control rabbit antisera ( Fig .
2B ) .
This demonstration of IL-4-stimulated STAT6 DNA binding activity in cells that do not express y , further supports the presence of an IL-4 signaling pathway independent of y , , and JAK3 .
STAT6 Phosphorylation and DNA Binding Activity Are Enhanced following Reconstitution of an X-SCID B-LCL with Wild Type y-In order to determine the role of y , in IL-4-mediated signaling , we assessed STAT6 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity in an X-SCID B-LCL in which y , , expression was reconstituted using retroviral mediated gene transduction ( 30 ) .
The data presented in Fig .
3 demonstrate that IL-4-mediated STAT6 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in the y , , reconstituted X-SCID B-LCL , approaching the level observed in the control B cell line .
Moreover , anti-STAT6 supershifted DNA binding complexes induced by IL-4 were more abundant in y , reconstituted X-SCID B-LCL than in the X-SCID B-LCL ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , wild type levels of STAT6 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity in control B-LCL are likely due to significant transduction through the y -dependent IL-4 pathway .
IL-4-induced Regulation of CD23 Expression in X-SCID and y , , Reconstituted B-LCL-Our data indicate that JAK1 , STAT6 , and IRS-1 can be phosphorylated by IL-4 in a y. , -independent fashion .
However , it was not clear whether these IL-4-mediated biochemical responses in B cells derived from X-SCID patients would result in biological outcomes , such as changes in gene expression in X-SCID B cells .
It has been shown that IL-4 induces CD23 ( FeeRII ) antigen expression in normal mature B cells ( 10 ) .
In order to determine whether y , expression had a significant effect on IL-4 functional responses , IL-4-induced regulation of CD23 in normal , X-SCID , and y , reconstituted X-SCID B-LCL was examined .
A 48-h incubation of control B cells with IL-4 resulted in an almost 2-fold increase in CD23 levels ( Fig .
4 ) , whereas no changes in CD23 expression were detected in B-LCL derived from a number of patients .
However , in X-SCID cells reconstituted with y , , there was an almost 2-fold increase of CD23 levels when compared with the same cells incubated without IL-4 .
This was a consistent finding in four replicate experiments .
These results suggest that y , is important for transducing some of the functional responses to IL-4 .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 7318 DISCUSSION Stimulation of B cells with IL-4 results in proliferation , immunoglobulin class switching , and regulation of cell surface proteins such as major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and the CD23 receptor .
Previous reports have concluded that the JAK-STAT pathway is not activated by IL-4 in the absence of y , ( 25 , 26 ) .
However , IL-4 can induce functional , although suboptimal , responses in X-SCID B cells ( 27 ) suggesting that the IL-4 signal transduction pathway is conserved in these cells .
X-SCID B cells , therefore , provide an important model in which to examine the generation of y.-independent IL-4 responses .
In this study , we determined that JAK1 , IRS-1 , and STAT6 were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-4 in B cell lines derived from X-SCID patients with a wide diversity of y , mutations and that IL-4 induced detectable levels of STAT6 DNA binding activity in these cells .
The finding that JAK3 was not phosphorylated in X-SCID B-LCL stimulated with either IL-2 or IL-4 was not surprising as a number of recent studies have demonstrated a physical association between y , and JAK3 ( 14 , 16 ) .
This interaction is thought to be critical for IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 signaling in lymphocytes ( 14 , 16 , 43 ) .
The data described here show that IL-4-induced JAK1 and IRS-1 phosphorylation as well as STAT6 activation can occur via mechanisms that are independent of y , and JAK3 .
IRS-1 is thought to be important for mediating IL-4 proliferative effects , but the mechanism by which IL-4 stimulates IRS-1 phosphorylation is unclear ( 44 ) .
Janus kinases likely play an important role ( 45 ) , and our data suggest that in the absence of JAK3 , JAK1 may mediate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-4 .
It remains to be determined whether other tyrosine kinases known to be induced by IL-4 , including JAK2 , Tyk2 , and Fes ( 46-48 ) , play a role in IL-4-mediated responses in X-SCID B cells .
Matthews et al .
( 27 ) showed that functional responses such as proliferation , IgE secretion , and CD23 expression could occur in X-SCID B cells when co-stimulated in vitro by IL-4 or IL-13 together with CD4OL or IgM .
However , in our studies , we did not detect an increase in CD23 expression in X-SCID B-LCL even though CD23 expression did increase in normal and y freconstituted X-SCID B-LCL following stimulation with IL-4 .
Because of the already high level of CD23 expression on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells , slight increases in CD23 expression may be difficult to detect .
Nevertheless , even in the studies performed by Matthews et al .
( 27 ) in primary B cells , the increase in CD23 in X-SCID B cells was significantly lower than that detected in control B cells ( 27 ) .
Suboptimal CD23 activation in response to IL-4 suggests that the observed humoral deficiency in X-SCID patients may result , at least in part , from the inability to transduce the full set of IL-4-induced signals through non-y , , containing receptors .
Our finding that IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation and CD23 expression were restored to wild type levels following introduction of y , , into these cells indicates that y , potentiates the IL-4 signal transduction pathway .
The importance of JAK3 in this y.-de-pendent pathway is further supported by the recent observation that IL-4-induced CD23 expression and STAT6 activation are also suboptimal in B cells that express y , , but are deficient in JAK3 ( 49 ) .
Although the precise mechanism by which this y , -independent signaling pathway is initiated is not clear , several groups have previously shown IL-4-induced proliferation and protein phosphorylation in endothelial , colon carcinoma , and plasmo-cytoma cell lines that lack y , ( 27 , 46 , 47 , 50-52 ) .
The y , -independent pathway in these cells has been suggested to function through a receptor that is shared by IL-4 and IL-13 since antibodies to the IL-4Ra chain can block the binding and IL-4 Signaling in X-SCID B Cells function of IL-4 as well as IL-13 ( 53-57 ) .
Accordingly , IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate the phosphorylation of many of the same downstream substrates ( 47 , 51 , 55 , 58-60 ) .
Moreover , IL-13 receptor subunits that have varied capacities to bind IL-4 have recently been identified ( 61 , 62 ) .
Our data support common signaling mechanisms as IL-4-activated JAK1 and STAT6 but not JAK3 in X-SCID B cells , and this concurs with what has been reported for IL-13 ( 47 , 51 58 , 60 ) .
Thus , an IL-4-mediated signal transduction pathway in y , -deficient X-SCID cells may occur via the same mechanisms utilized by IL-13 .
In contrast to other forms of SCID that present with a complete absence of both T and B lymphocytes , X-SCID patients have normal to elevated numbers of nonfunctional B cells .
However , it is clear that the IL-4 signaling that we have detected is not sufficient for normal B cell function .
The findings presented here provide insight into IL-4 signal transduction pathways and B cell function in X-SCID patients .
The physiological role of the described y , .
independent IL-4R pathway in normal individuals as well as in patients with X-SCID awaits further investigation .
