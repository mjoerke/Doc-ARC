Randy Q. Cron , * Susan J. Bort , * Yunxia Wang , * Mark W. Brunvand , '' and David B. Lewis®* The repetitive activation of T cells ( priming ) enhances the expression of many cytokines , such as IL-4 , but not others , such as IL-2 .
Molecular mechanisms underlying selective expression of cytokines by T cells remain poorly understood .
Here we show that priming of CD4 T cells selectively enhances IL-4 expression relative to IL-2 expression by a transcriptional mechanism involving nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) proteins .
As detected by in vivo footprinting , priming markedly increases the activation-dependent engagement of the PO and P1 NFAT-binding elements of the IL-4 promoter .
Moreover , each proximal P element is essential for optimal IL-4 promoter activity .
Activated primed CD4 T cells contain more NFAT1 and support greater NFAT-directed transcription than unprimed CD4 T cells , while activator protein 1 binding and activator protein 1-mediated transcription by both cell types is similar .
Increased expression of wild-type NFAT1 substantially increases IL-4 promoter activity in unprimed CD4 T cells , suggesting NFAT1 may be limiting for IL-4 gene expression in this cell type .
Furthermore , a truncated form of NFAT1 acts as a dominant-negative , reducing IL-4 promoter activity in primed CD4 T cells and confirming the importance of endogenous NFAT to increased IL-4 gene expression by effector T cells .
NFAT1 appears to be the major NFAT family member responsible for the initial increased expression of IL-4 by primed CD4 T cells .
ytokine secretion by T cells is a critical component of Ag-specific immunity .
Among the many cytokines pro duced by T cells , IL-4 has emerged as an important effector molecule ( 1 ) .
IL-4-mediated effects include the enhancement of IgE production by B cells and the differentiation of antigenically naive CD4 T cells into a Th2 population rather than a Th1 population ( 2 ) .
Recent in vivo experiments in which IL-4 or its specific receptor has been manipulated have revealed that IL-4 is essential for allergic disease and is a critical determinant of the outcome of infection or autoimmunity in some contexts ( 3 ) .
As a result , there has been a great deal of interest in defining the mechanisms controlling IL-4 production by T cells ( 4 ) .
IL-4 production and mRNA expression by T cells is mainly limited to CD4 T cells that have been activated previously in vivo .
These include recently activated effector T cells , most of which are short-lived , as well as long-lived memory T cells , in which activation may have occurred months or years before ( 5 , 6 ) .
In contrast , expression of IL-4 by antigenically naive CD4 T cells is minimal , while bulk populations of naive , effector , and memory CD4 T cells are all capable of substantial IL-2 production ( 7 , 8 ) .

Priming not only increases IL-4 expression but that of most other T cell-derived cytokines as well , with the notable exception of IL-2 ( 8 , 9 ) .
However , the molecular mechanisms by which priming acts to modulate the expression of the IL-4 gene and other cytokine genes remains poorly defined .
Expression of IL-4 and most T cell-derived cytokines appears to be predominantly regulated by the level of gene transcription ( 7 , 10 ) .
Analysis of transcription mediated by the 5 ' flank or enhancer region of cytokine genes , including IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , granulocyte-macrophage CSF ( GM-CSF ) '' , IL-5 , IL-13 , and CD4O-ligand , has revealed that purine-rich motifs , termed P elements , are critical for lymphocyte activation-induced transcription in T cells ( 11 ) .
In many cases , the P element in conjunction with an adjacent binding site for leucine zipper proteins , such as those of the activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) family , binds a nuclear protein complex , termed nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , which is induced by T cell activation .
Recently , two related but distinct gene products of peripheral T cells , NFAT1 ( NFATp , NFATc2 ) and NFAT2 ( NFATc , NFATcl ) , have been cloned on the basis of their binding in vitro to the IL-2 promoter purine-rich sequences ( 12 , 13 ) .
In addition , a third NFAT gene product , NFAT4 ( NFAT ' x , NFATc3 ) , expressed at high levels by thymocytes , has been cloned based on sequence homology to the Rel similarity DNA binding region ( 14-17 ) .
Transient overexpression of NFAT proteins in Jurkat thymoma cells increases expression of IL-2 , IL-4 , GM-CSF , and TNF promoter-driven reporter gene constructs , indicating that NFAT proteins are transcriptional activators of cytokine genes ( 14 , 18 ) .
Conversely , the immunosuppressive drugs , cyclosporin A and FK506 , inhibit cytokine gene transcription by T cells , including IL-2 and IL-4 , by blocking the calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT proteins and 3 Abbreviations used in this paper : GM-CSF , granulocyte-macrophage CSF ; AP-1 , activator protein 1 ; NFAT , NF of activated T cells ; FCF , flow cytofluorometric anal-ysis ; CM , complete medium ; EF-1 @ , elongation factor-1a ; PE , phycoerythrin ; TSS , transcription start site ; GEFP , green fluorescent protein ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay .

The role of NFAT proteins and P elements in regulating IL-4 gene transcription during the extrathymic differentiation of antigenically naive T cells into effector or memory T cells remains to be defined .
In this study , we demonstrate that increased IL-4 production by primed CD4 T cells is due , at least in part , to enhanced transcription directed by the immediate 5 ' flank promoter of the IL-4 gene .
We further show that both proximal P elements of the IL-4 promoter , PO and P1 , are occupied in vivo during IL-4 transcription in normal human T cells , and that both are independently required for optimal IL-4 reporter gene activity in this cell type .
An analysis of nuclear protein complexes formed in vitro with an IL-4 P1 element oligonucleotide demonstrates that NFAT 1 is the major NFAT protein forming a specific complex in fresh and primed CD4 T cells , and that there is a striking and direct correlation between the abundance of NFAT1 in the nucleus and IL-4 gene expression .
Impor-tantly , expression of wild-type and truncated NFAT1 constructs demonstrates that NFAT1 is a limiting component for IL-4 gene transcription by fresh CD4 T cells and also plays a role in the enhanced level of IL-4 gene expression by primed T cells .
Western blot analysis and IL-4 promoter-directed reporter gene studies involving transient overexpression of various NFAT family members both indicate that NFAT1 , rather than other NFAT family members , contributes to increased IL-4 gene expression by primed human CD4 T cells .
Together , these results suggest that an increase in NFAT1 in primed CD4 T cells is an important mechanism by which priming of T cells enhances the expression of IL-4 .
This mechanism , or a similar one , may also contribute to the increased expression of other cytokines by primed T cells , a critical event in T cell-mediated immunity .
Materials and Methods Cells and priming in vitro Whole blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of normal adult volunteer donors , and circulating T cells or CD4 T cells were obtained by treatment of whole mononuclear cells with T-cell Lymphok-wik or T-Helper Kwik , respectively ( One Lambda , Los Angeles , CA ) , as described ( 20 ) .
Flow cytofluorometric ( FCF ) analysis with appropriate directly conjugated mouse anti-human mAbs revealed that the isolated CD4 T cell populations were routinely > 98 % CD3 * , < 1 % CD8 * , and 85-98 % CD4* .
T cells or CD4 T cells ( 1-2 X 10°/ml ) were primed in vitro by incubation in complete medium ( CM ; Ref .
20 ) containing 10 ng/ml of human rIL-2 ( Proleukin-2 ; Promega , Madison , WJ ) , 3 ug/ml of Con A ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) , 1 ng/ml of PMA ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) , and an equal number of irradiated ( 3300 rads ) syngeneic whole mononuclear cells in 12-well flat-bottom plastic tissue culture dishes ( Corning , Corning , NY ) .
Medium was replaced every 2-3 days with fresh CM containing IL-2 .
Primed CD4 T cells were harvested after 10-30 days in culture , and viable cells were obtained by centrifugation over a Ficoll/Hypaque gradient before experimentation .
Northern blot analysis Primed or fresh CD4 T cells were stimulated in CM with 1.5 uM ionomycin ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) and 50 ng/ml of PMA for 5-6 h , under conditions previously determined to be optimal for maximal IL-4 mRNA accumulation ( 7 ) .
Total RNA was isolated by the method of Chom-czynski and Sacchi ( 21 ) using a commercial kit ( Trireagent ; Molecular Research Center , Cincinnati , OH ) .
RNA ( 10 pug per sample ) was analyzed for IL-2 , IL-4 , and elongation factor-1a ( EF-1 @ ) transcripts by RNA blotting as previously described ( 7 ) .
Intracellular cytokine detection CD4 T cells were cultured for 6 h in vitro with CM containing 1.5 M ionomcyin , 50 ng/ml of PMA , and 2 M monensin ( Calbiochem ) as previously described ( 22 ) .
The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( pH 7.4 ) for 5 min at 37°C .
Fixed cells were washed in ice-cold PBS with 0.1 % ( w/v ) BSA and permeabilized by incubation overnight at 4°C in PBS-S ( PBS ( pH 7.4 ) with 0.01 M HEPES , 0.1 % ( w/v ) BSA , 0.1 % ( w/v ) saponin ( Fluka , 861 Ronkonkoma , NY ) , and 10 % human type AB serum ) .
Aliquots of cells ( 2 X 10° ) were incubated with 100 ng of phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated 8D4-8 mAb ( murine IgG1 anit-human IL-4 ; PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) or PE-conjugated MQ1-17H12 ( murine IgG2a anti-human IL-2 ; PharMin-gen ) for 30 min on ice .
FITC-conjugated murine IgG2a anti-human CD3 mAb ( $ 4.1 ; Caltag Laboratories , San Francisco , CA ) or a FITC-conjugated IgG2a mAb control ( Caltag Laboratories ) were included with the anti-cytokine mAbs .
The cells were sequentially washed with PBS-S and PBS alone before analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Preincubation of anti-IL-4 with 100 ng of human rIL-4 ( provided by Dr. Ken Grabstein , Immunex , Seattle , WA ) or anti-IL-2 with 100 ng of human rIL-2 ( Proleukin-2 ) for 1 h on ice before addition to the cells resulted in > 95 % and > 70 % inhibition of staining , respectively ( data not shown ) .
Debris were removed from the analysis by gating , using side-scatter vs forward-scatter plots .
FCF analysis was performed using the Lysys II software program ( Becton Dickinson ) and plotted with the program Reproman ( True Facts Software , Seattle , WA ) .
Dimethyl sulfate in vivo footprinting In vivo footprinting was performed as previously described ( 23 ) .
Primed or fresh CD4 T cells were stimulated at 5 X 10° cells/ml in CM , or CM with 1.5 M ionomycin , and 50 ng/ml of PMA for 2 h at 37°C .
The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 2 ml of CM at 23°C , and 2.5 pil of dimethyl sulfate ( Aldrich , Milwaukee , WI ) was added to methylate the N-7 position of G residues and the N-3 position of A residues .
After gentle mixing for 30 s , the cells were immediately transferred to 15 ml of ice-cold PBS ( pH 7.4 ) with 2 ml of 2-ME .
The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended and lysed in SDS as described ( 23 ) .
Genomic DNA was isolated from the cell lysate by digestion with 1 mg/ml of proteinase K ( Life Tech-nologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) for 1 h at 37°C , followed by repeated phenol/ chloroform extraction and precipitation with sodium acetate and ethanol ( 24 ) .
The DNA was dissolved in 0.017 M HCI and incubated for 15 min on ice to open the ring structure of the methylated bases .
Strand cleavage was effected at each methylated base by piperidine ( Aldrich ) ( 25 ) .
The cleaved DNA was used as a substrate for ligation-mediated PCR amplification ( 26 ) .
The nested primers used to visualize the noncoding strand of the human IL-4 proximal promoter were primer 315 ( 5-AAGGTTTCATTITTC CTATTGGTC ) , primer 316 ( 5-GGTCTGATTTCACAGGAACATTIT TACCTG , and primer 317 ( 5-GGTCTGATITCACAGGAACATTT TACCTGTTTGTGAG ) .
Primers 315 , 316 , and 317 were annealed in 3 mM MgCl , at 54°C , 57°C , and 62°C , respectively .
Primer 317 was *°P-labeled , and the footprints were detected by analysis on sequencing gels using autoradiography as described ( 26 ) .
In vitro dimethyl sulfate modification of genomic DNA was conducted as previously described ( 23 ) .
Reporter gene and NFAT expression constructs pIL-4-Luc was created by PCR amplification of the human IL-4 promoter ( -745 to +60 with respect to the transcriptional start site ( TSS ) ) using standard methods ( 27 ) and the human IL-4 genomic clone , 10.2 , as a template ( 20 ) .
The PCR primers included Psf and HindIII sites in their 5 ' region to facilitate subcloning into the polylinker of the promoterless pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter gene vector ( Promega ) .
pIL-2-Luc was made by subcloning the human HindIIW/HindlII IL-2 promoter segment ( -568 to +50 with respect to the TSS ) ( 28 ) into pGL2-Basic .
pCMV-Luc , provided by Dr. Marianne Sweetser ( University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) , was created by inserting a 1150-bp Smal/HindIII-digested fragment of the promoter of the immediate-early CMV gene ( 29 ) into pGL2-Basic .

NFAT2/pREP-4 was generated by subcloning a 2.8-kb Xho BamHI fragment containing a full-length human NFATc cDNA segment ( 13 ) ( generously provided by Dr. Gerald Crabtree , Stanford University , Palo Alto , CA ) immediately downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter in the pREP-4 expression vector ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
A dominant-negative NFAT expression vector , NFATIANH , /pREP-4 , which lacks the amino terminal transcriptional activation domain , was created by subcloning a 5.7-kb Xhol/KpnI truncated fragment of the full-length NFAT1-coding sequence into the pREP-4 expression vector .
Multiple independent preparations of plasmids used for transfection were isolated by banding in cesium chloride ( 24 ) or by using a commercial affinity column following the manufacturer 's instructions ( Qia-gen , Chatsworth , CA ) .

The human IL-4 PO site ( 5 ' end beginning at -58 ) was mutated from ATTT TCCCT to ATTTGAGCT , and the human IL-4 P1 site ( 5 ' end beginning at -76 ) was changed from AATTTCCAA to AATTCGAAA .
Mutant plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion , since the designed mutations created new unique restriction sites .
Transient transfections T cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using a modified protocol ( 32 , 33 ) .
In brief , freshly isolated or in vitro-primed CD4 T cells ( 5 X 10° cells ) were electroporated with 10 pug of luciferase reporter plasmids as previously described ( 27 , 32 ) .
For cotransfections , 5-20 ug of pREP-4-based expression plasmids was included in the electroporation .
All time constants generated during electroporations were within 10 % of the mean time constant for any particular experiment .
Cell viability , as assessed by trypan blue exclusion at 1 h postelectroporation , was > 80 % for each individual transfection .
One million live cells per well were stimulated and analyzed for luciferase activity as previously described ( 27 ) .
Statistical analyses , including Student 's f tests for two group comparisons , were performed using Sigma Stat 2.0 software ( Jandel Scientific , San Rafael , CA ) .
In some experiments , transfection efficiency was analyzed by FCF using a plasmid , pGreen Lantern-1 ( Life Technologies ) , encoding green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) from Aeguorea victoria jellyfish ( 34 ) under the control of the intact immediate-early CMV promoter .
Primed and fresh CD4 T cells ( 5 X 10° cells ) were electroporated with 15 ug of pGreen Lantern-1 or pEQ-176 ( LacZ driven by the immediate-early CMV promoter , as a control ) , and cultured in CM for 5 h at 37°C .
The cells were washed in PBS with 0.1 % ( w/v ) BSA , incubated with PE-conjugated anti-CD4 ( IgG2a , clone $ 3.5 ; Caltag Laboratories ) or a PE-conjugated IgG2a control mAb ( Caltag Laboratories ) for 30 min on ice , and then washed sequentially in PBS with 0.1 % ( w/v ) BSA , and in PBS before analysis by FACScan .
GFP was detected using FITC filters ( 475-nm excitation peak , 485-nm barrier peak , 490-nm emission peak ) as described ( 35 ) .
Nuclear protein preparations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) Fresh and primed whole T cell and CD4 T cell populations were stimulated for 2 h with Con A ( 25 pug/m1 ) , or ionomycin ( 1.5 M ) ( see Fig .
7 ) , and PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) , and nuclear proteins were extracted as described ( 36 ) .
All nuclear preparations analyzed were free of significant contamination by cytoplasmic protein based on the lack of detectable signal for lactate dehydrogenase protein by chemiluminescent Western blot analysis ( data not shown ) .
EMSAs were performed as previously described ( 20 ) .
The NFAT ! -specific antiserum and peptide , 67.1 , against which it was made ( 37 ) , were generously provided by Dr. Anjana Rao ( Dana-Farber Cancer Research Center , Boston , MA ) .
This antiserum recognizes the amino-terminal portion of NFAT1 ( AISSPSGLAYPDDVLDYGL ) that is not conserved in NFAT2 ( 37 ) or NFAT4 ( 38 ) .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides used as P-labeled probes or as unlabeled competitors were synthesized using an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer ( Beckman , Palo Alto , CA ) .
The oligonucleotides ( the sequence of only one strand is shown ) included the human IL-4 promoter P1 element ( -66 to -82 with respect to the TSS ) , 5'-ATTGGAAATTITTTCGTTA ( noncoding strand ) ( 39 ) ; and a human me-tallothionein promoter AP-1-binding site , 5'-ACGTGACTCAGCGCGC ( coding strand ) ( 40 ) .
A mutant human IL-4 P1 oligonucleotide ( 5-ATT GGTCATTTTCGTTA ) was used as a nonspecific competitor , with the mutated residues indicated in bold .
Western blot analysis Total cell protein preparations from freshly isolated or in vitro-primed CD4 T cells were prepared as described ( 41 ) .
One hundred million cells per group were washed in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of Tris-EDTA-NaCl lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 2 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 10 M dichloroisocoumarin ( Sigma ) , 0.5 ng/ml of leupeptin ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) , 0.5 ng/m !

Cellular debris was centrifuged for 5 min at 7,500 X g , and supernatants containing total cellular proteins were stored at -80°C until analyzed .
Protein concentration was determined for an aliquot of each protein preparation by the Bradford assay using a com NFAT ENHANCES IL-4 IN PRIMED CD4 T CELLS mercially available kit ( Pierce Chemical , Rockford , IL ) .
Total or nuclear protein ( 20 pug/sample ) was loaded per lane in SDS-containing loading buffer onto a vertical SDS-PAGE gel with a 4.6 % acrylamide stacking gel and a 10 % acrylamide separating gel , and electrophoresed for 16 h at 50 V/h in SDS-containing running buffer .
The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) by electroblotting at 50 V/h for 12 h. The blot was blocked for 1 h with PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and 0.1 % ( v/v ) Tween 20 ( PBS-Tween ) , containing 3 % ( w/v ) BSA , and then immu-nohybridized for 2 h with anti-NFAT1-specific rabbit antiserum , 67.1 , at a concentration of 1:2000 in PBS-Tween .
After three consecutive washes in PBS-Tween , the blot was reacted for 2 h with a 1:2000 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase ( Amersham ) in PBS-Tween , followed by three washes with PBS-Tween .
In the experiments shown in Fig .

Results Primed CD4 T cells have greater expression of IL-4 transcripts and more IL-4 protein per cell than fresh CD4 T cells Our previous in situ hybridization experiments using polyclonally activated adult human CD4 T cells have shown a markedly lower frequency of cells expressing IL-4 mRNA than IL-2 transcripts ( 7 ) .
The bulk of these IL-4-producing CD4 T cells express a CD4SRO® '' ® '' CD45RA'** memory/effector cell surface phenotype ( 7 , 43 ) , while IL-2 is produced at a similar frequency by memory/ effector and antigenically naive ( CD45RO°*CD45RA '' ® '' ) cells .
Since freshly isolated T cells activated and cultured in vitro for several days to weeks ( primed ) 1 ) have an increased ability to produce most T cell-derived cytokines , with the exception of IL-2 ( 8 , 9 ) , and 2 ) tend to lose expression of CD4SRA and gain expression of CD45RO ( 44 ) , priming appears to mimic the process by which T cells in vivo acquire an enhanced ability to produce cytokines during their differentiation from antigenically naive to memory/effector T cells .
In agreement with these earlier results , we found here that the amount of mRNA for IL-4 relative to that for EF-1 « @ , a constitu-tively expressed housekeeping gene ( 7 , 20 ) , was substantially higher in primed CD4 T cells than freshly isolated circulating CD4 T cells after polyclonal activation ( Fig .
14 ) .
The small amount of IL-4 transcripts detected in fresh CD4 T cells is most likely produced by a subset of circulating memory CD4SRO®*® '' CD45RA ! °~ CD4 T cells ( 7 ) .
In contrast , fresh CD4 T cells produced either more or equivalent amounts of IL-2 mRNA , relative to EF-l « transcripts , compared with primed/effector CD4 T cells ( Fig .
1A ) .
Primed CD4 T cells always produced more IL-4 on a per cell basis than fresh CD4 T cells , although there was substantial variability among donors for IL-4 production by fresh CD4 T cells .
Results of an experiment , in which IL-4 production was analyzed in fresh and primed CD4 T cells by intracellular cytokine staining , and where the donor source of the fresh and primed CD4 T cells was iden-tical , are shown in Fig .
1B .
After a 6-h stimulation with ionomycin and PMA , 38 % of the primed CD4 T cells accumulated IL-4 protein , while only 13 % ( typically only 2-5 % for most donors ) of fresh CD4 T cells had detectable IL-4 .

Cell surface staining for CD3e is depicted along the x-axis , with cytokine staining for IL-4 ( top panels ) and IL-2 ( bot-tom panels ) on the y-axis .
levels of IL-4 in individual T cells were only detected among the primed CD4 T cell population .
In contrast , the vast majority of both primed and fresh CD4 T cells made IL-2 ( 78 % and 72 % , respectively ) , and most IL-2-ex-pressing fresh CD4 T cells contained more IL-2 on a per cell basis than primed CD4 T cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
Memory/effector cell markers , such as CD29 ( B , integrin chain ) , were present at high levels on usually < 15 % of fresh CD4 T cells , whereas almost all ( > 95 % ) primed CD4 T cells expressed these markers at high levels ( data not shown ) , in agreement with previous reports ( 44 ) .
Together , these results indicated that the increase in IL-4 production by priming was due both to an increase in the frequency of the IL-4-producing cells , as well as the amount of IL-4 produced per cell .
It seems unlikely that we were selectively expanding a subset of IL-4-producing €D4 T cells that do not also make IL-2 , since other investigators have shown that approximately half of the IL-4-producing CD4 T cells also expressed IL-2 ( 45 , 46 ) .
Thus , while fresh and primed bulk CD4 T cell populations are polyclonal and display some heterogeneity of cytokine production at the single cell level , these two cell populations provide a useful model for molecular analysis of how priming selectively increases the expression of IL-4 relative to IL-2 .
IL-4 promoter activity is greater in primed CD4 T cells than fresh CD4 T cells The recent development of a protocol for transient transfection of normal human T cells allowed us to analyze IL-4 promoter-driven A .

Primed and fresh CD4 T cells were compared for their abilities to transcribe , after transient transfection , a reporter gene construct ( pIL-4-Luc , containing 0.8 kb of the 5 ' flank human IL-4 promoter ) .
This determined whether the increased IL-4 mRNA and protein levels in primed CD4 T cells were due to an increased level of transcription conferred by the 5 ' flank of the IL-4 promoter .
For comparison , both cell types were also analyzed for their ability to transcribe a corresponding reporter plasmid containing the proximal human IL-2 promoter ( pIL-2-Luc ) .
The ratio of luciferase detected using the pIL-4-Luc construct between the primed and fresh CD4 T cells was substantially greater ( 17-fold ) than the ratio obtained with pIL-2-Lue construct ( 3.4-fold ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
To control for transfection efficiency between the two cell types , fresh and primed CD4 T cells were analyzed for expression of GFP and luciferase reporter genes under the control of the immediate-early CMV promoter .
In three separate FCF analyses , 0.57 + 0.16 % of fresh CD4 T cells and 1.54 + 0.64 % of primed CD4 T cells expressed GFP , indicating that the transfection efficiency of primed cells was typically about 3-fold greater than that of fresh cells .
In these experiments , GFP and luciferase were determined in parallel , and the ratio of pCMV-Luc activity of primed to fresh CD4 T cells was virtually identical to the ratio of primed to fresh cells which were GFP * .

Therefore , the ratio of CMV promoter-directed luciferase activity between the primed and fresh T cells was used to correct for their relative transfection efficiency in subsequent experiments .
IL-2 promoter activity was similar in fresh and primed CD4 T cells when the luciferase light units were corrected for transfection efficiency ( Fig .
2B ) .
By contrast , IL-4 promoter activity was approximately 3.5-fold greater in primed CD4 T cells compared with fresh cells .
We also determined the ratio of pIL-4-Luc to pIL-2-Luc luciferase activity for either primed/effector or fresh T cells , a value that is not influenced by differences in transfection efficiency for these two cell types .
The ratio of pIL-4-Lue to pIL-2-Luc in multiple experiments was 0.35 + 0.09 for the primed CD4 T cells , and 0.09 + 0.06 for the fresh €D4 T cells ( Fig .
2C ; p = 0.002 , by the two-tailed , unpaired Student 's ¢ test ) .
Taken together , these results suggested that increased IL-4 mRNA and protein expression by primed T cells were due , at least in part , to an enhanced level of IL-4 gene transcription directed by the elements within the 0.8-kb segment of the proximal IL-4 promoter .
They also indicated that within the context of the reporter plasmid , pGL2-Basic , the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter was stronger than that of the IL-4 promoter in both fresh and primed CD4 T cells .
Thus , the immediate 5 ' flank promoter regions of the IL-4 and IL-2 genes mediated , at least in part , differences in their transcription by primed vs fresh CD4 T cells .
The two P elements most proximal to the TSS are engaged in vivo after cell activation in primed CD4 T cells Since the region immediately 5 ' of the IL-4 gene TSS appears critical for activation-induced expression of the IL-4 gene in T cells ( 47-52 ) , a plausible mechanism for the increased activity of the IL-4 promoter in primed , compared with fresh , CD4 T cells would be increased binding of transcriptional activator proteins to this region in primed CD4 T cells .
To test this possibility , we used in vivo footprinting to compare engagement of this region by proteins in these two cell types before and after polyclonal activation for 2 h with PMA and ionomycin .
A striking finding was that footprints were detected over both the PO and P1 elements of the IL-4 gene in primed CD4 T cells following activation ( Fig .
3A ) , indicating protein binding to these sites in vivo .
Previous in vitro studies using nuclear protein extracts from activated T cells have indicated that both of these sites bind proteins of the NFAT transcription factor family ( 53 , 54 ) .
However , no such footprints were detectable in multiple experiments using polyclonally activated fresh CD4 T cells .
This is most likely due to the low percentage of cells in this population expressing IL-4 and the semiquantitative nature of the PCR amplification process used during in vivo footprinting ( Fig .
34 ) .
Such footprints were also not observed in unstimulated fresh or primed CD4 T cells , in that the pattern of bands in this region were similar to that obtained with purified human genomic DNA exhaustively methylated in vitro .
Clear footprints in response to activation were also detectable at the 5 ' end of the putative c-maf response element , a site implicated in expression of the IL-4 gene by Th2 cells ( 55 ) , as well as immediately 3 ' of this site in primed but not fresh CD4 T cells ( Fig .
34 ) .
In contrast , the octamer-binding site ( Oct ) located between PO and P1 was footprinted in primed CD4 T cells before activation ( Fig .
34 ) , but became hypersensitive relative to unstimulated primed CD4 T cells after activation ( Fig .
34 ) , suggesting that activation resulted in the release of protein ( s ) bound to this site .
Moreover , mutation of the Oct site within the context of an otherwise unperturbed pIL-4-Luc reporter gene resulted in increased transcriptional activity ( data not shown ) .

The proximal NFAT-binding sites ( P elements ) of the IL-4 promoter are bound in vivo after activation and are critical for optimal IL-4 expression .
A , The noncoding strand of the proximal IL-4 promoter was analyzed by in vivo footprinting of primed ( above ) and fresh ( below ) CD4 T cells before ( Unstim . )
and after activation ( Stim . )
with PMA and ionomycin for 2 h. Sites of protein binding ( footprints ) are depicted by arrows , and hypermethylated sites are represented by diamonds .
The A/G cleavage pattern for genomic DNA ( in vitro ) is presented for comparison ( fop ) .
The data are representative of more than four independent experiments for each cell type .
In some experiments the hypermethylated band in P1 ( far left diamond ) was footprinted in primed CD4 T cells .
P1 and PO represent the most proximal NFAT binding sites ; Oct is a putative octamer binding site ; Maf is a putative binding site for c-maf , TATA is the TATA box region of the IL-4 promoter .
B , Primed CD4 T cells were transiently transfected and activated for 5 h , as in Fig .
2 , with pIL-4-Luc or the identical plasmid mutated at the PO or P1 sites .
Arbitrary light units , minus the background from pGL2-Basic ( means + the SEs ) , are shown that are representative of more than five independent experiments .
nearby transcriptional activator , before cell activation , has been observed for the IL-8 promoter ( 56 ) , but a recent report suggests that octamer binding , in conjunction with PO element engagement , may actually increase IL-4 promoter activity in a T cell clone ( 57 ) .
This discrepancy may reflect differences between T cells that have been propagated in vitro for short vs long periods of time .
None-theless , increased human IL-4 promoter activity by primed human CD4 T cells correlated with increased engagement of PO , P1 , and the putative c-maf response element , and decreased engagement of the Oct cis-element .
In addition to being bound in vivo after activation in primed CD4 T cells ( Fig .
34 ) , previous work using murine Th2 clones has suggested that PO and P1 are each critical for IL-4 promoter activity in T cells in response to cell activation ( 53 , 54 ) .
To test the functional importance of these elements in primed CD4 T cells , the critical purine residues of PO and P1 required for NFAT binding ( 53 , 58 ) were mutated by substitution in an otherwise unaltered pIL-4-Lue construct to create POm-Luc and Pim-Luc , respectively .
Each mutant construct decreased IL-4 expression by > 75 % in multiple experiments ( Fig .
3B ) , indicating that each of these NFAT binding sites was important for optimal transcription of the IL-4 gene in nontransformed human T cells .
Primed T cell nuclei are enriched for NFAT1 capable of binding to the IL-4 P1 element Since the proximal NFAT-binding sites appeared critical for IL-4 gene expression , we determined if specific binding of nuclear protein , from primed vs fresh CD4 T cells , to P elements in vitro correlated with IL-4 promoter activity and gene expression .

The specificity of the antiserum-induced supershifts was confirmed in lane 3 by preincu-bating the antiserum with the peptide against which it was generated .

of nuclear protein that bound in vitro to the human IL-4 P1 element ( Fig .
4A , lane 1 ) , similar to what was found by Wenner et al .
( 59 ) and Rincon and Flavell ( 60 ) .
Polyclonal activation of the primed CD4 T cells for 2 h further increased this level of protein binding ( Fig .
4A , lane 3 ) .
This binding was specific in that addition of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled self-oligonucleotide competed for binding ( Fig .
44 , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
Furthermore , we found no evidence for contaminating cytoplasmic protein since the same nuclear extract had no detectable lactate dehydrogenase ( a strictly cytosolic protein ) by Western blot analysis , whereas lactate dehydrogenase was easily detected in whole cell extracts from the same cell population ( data not shown ) .
Antiserum to NFAT1 was used during EMSA to determine the identity of the nuclear proteins from activated primed T cells bound to the human IL-4 P1 element .
As seen in Fig .
4B , the vast majority of the complex bound to the human IL-4 P1 was supershifted with NFAT1-specific antiserum ( Zane 2 ) .
The supershift was specific since preincubation of the antiserum with the peptide against which it was made completely abrogated the supershift ( Fig .
4B , lane 3 ) .
In addition , the nuclear protein ( s ) bound to the human IL-4 P1 element were demonstrated to not be the common , NFAT-related , NF-KB proteins ( c-Rel , Rel A , and NF- « B p50 ) by lack of effect of specific antisera to these proteins by gel shift analysis ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , very little complex with the human IL-4 P1 element was detected using an equivalent quantity of nuclear protein from activated fresh T cells ( Fig .
4B , lane 4 ) .
The small amount detected , however , was specific ( lane 5 ) and predominantly supershifted by the NFAT1-specific antiserum ( lane 6 ) , similar to recent results by Lykah et al .
( 61 ) and Timmerman et al .
( 42 ) .
EMSA , using an oligonucleotide probe for a human metallo-thionein promoter AP-1 site , demonstrated that in contrast to NFAT1 binding ( Fig .
4B , lanes 1 and 4 ) there were roughly equivalent levels of AP-1 protein binding in the nuclei of primed and fresh human T cells after polyclonal activation ( Fig .
4C , lanes I and 4 ) .
The specificity of binding to the AP-1 element was shown by inhibition of complex formation with unlabeled self oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4C , lanes 2 and 5 ) , but not by a nonspecific competitor ( Zanes 3 and 6 ) .
To determine whether the observed increased NFAT1 binding to the P1 element in primed T cells was due to quantitative differ-ences , nuclear and total protein from stimulated and unstimulated fresh and primed CD4 T cells was analyzed by Western blot using an NFAT ! -specific antiserum .
NFAT1 was barely detectable , as either a 110- or 130-kDa protein , in nuclear extracts of fresh CD4 T cells ( Fig .
4D , lane 1 ) .
A small increase in the lower m.w .
form was noticeable after activation , and this may represent a dephos-phorylated form of NFAT1 ( Fig .
4D , lane 2 ) ( 62 ) .
In contrast , significant levels of NFAT1 were present in the nucleus of unstimulated primed CD4 T cells , primarily as a 130-kDa protein ( Fig .
4D , lane 3 ) .
After polyclonal activation of the primed CD4 T cells , an increase in the amount of the 130-kDa form of NFAT1 was observed , as well as the appearance of a dominant form of ~120 kDa ( Fig .
4D , lane 4 ) .
Analysis of metabolically labeled nuclear protein ( 63 ) from primed CD4 T cells confirmed that the protein binding to the P1 oligonucleotide was ~115 kDa in size ( data not shown ) .
By comparison , significant levels of the higher m.w .
form of NFAT1 were detected from total protein preparations of fresh and primed CD4 T cells ( Fig .
4D , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
However , there was more total NFAT1 detected in the primed CD4 T cells , including low levels of the 110- and 120-kDa forms , possibly derived from the nucleus .
Thus , these results suggested that quantitative and , possibly , qualitative differences in nuclear NFAT1 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 866 NFAT ENHANCES IL-4 IN PRIMED CD4 T CELLS A .

Primed/effector CD4 T cells have more functional NFAT than fresh CD4 T cells To determine whether increased expression of NFAT protein by primed T cells correlated with an increased capacity for these cells to direct transcription via NFAT-binding cis-elements , fresh and primed CD4 T cells were transfected with luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by multimers of either the distal human IL-2 NFAT site ( a multimer of a P element and an adjacent AP-1 site ) or the human IL-2 AP-1 site ( a multimer of an AP-1 binding site , alone ) .
Although the NFAT multimer had promoter activity in both cell types ( Fig .
54 ) , it was significantly higher in primed CD4 T cells compared with fresh CD4 T cells , even when promoter activities were corrected for transfection efficiency ( Fig .
5B ) .
Similar results were obtained using a murine IL-4 promoter-derived NFAT multimer construct site ( 59 ) that includes the P1 binding site and an adjacent AP-1 ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , both cell types contained similar levels of luciferase activity after transfection with the pAP-1-Lue construct when normalized for transfection efficiency ( Fig .

The mean ratios of the pNFAT-Luc to the pAP-1-Lue activity in fresh and primed CD4 T cells were 1.5 + 0.16 and 9.3 + 0.88 , respectively ( Fig .

This highly significant difference ( p < 0.001 by the two-tailed , unpaired Student 's £ test ) supports the idea that priming preferentially increased P element-di-rected transcription relative to that directed by AP-1 elements .
NFAT is critical for optimal IL-4 gene transcription To determine whether increased NFAT expression could augment IL-4 promoter activity in fresh and primed CD4 T cells , an expression vector for NFAT1 ( NFAT1/pREP-4 ) was cotransfected with pIL-4-Luc into these cell types .
Transfection of fresh CD4 T cells with increasing amounts of NFAT1/pREP-4 markedly increased IL-4 promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion , achieving levels of activity that were ~3.5-fold greater than basal levels ( Fig .
64 ) .
Although transfection of increasing amounts of NFAT1/pREP-4 plasmid into primed CD4 T cells also progressively increased IL-4 promoter activity , the maximal enhancement of promoter activity was relatively modest compared with the basal level ( ~1.5-fold ) .

25- close to optimal for directing IL-4 promoter activity in primed CD4 T cells .
To determine whether NFAT proteins binding to P elements are essential for IL-4 promoter activity by primed CD4 T cells , we generated an expression construct for an amino-terminal-truncated form of NFAT1 ( NFATIANH/pREP-4 ) .
This truncated form of NFAT1 should act as a dominant-negative since it lacks a region containing an important transcriptional activation domain , while retaining the domain required for binding to the P element ( 64 ) .
As seen in Fig .
6B , cotransfection of this construct into primed CD4 T cells substantially decreased pIL-4-Luc activity , in contrast to the full-length NFAT1 plasmid , which slightly enhanced luciferase production .
The NFATIANH , /pREP-4 inhibitory activity was specific , in that it did not inhibit a reporter plasmid ( pCMV-Luc ) lacking P elements in the promoter ( data not shown ) .
These results strongly suggest that NFAT proteins play a critical role in the transcription of the IL-4 gene by primed T cells .
Although the vast majority of NFAT protein bound to the IL-4 P1 element in vitro appeared to be NFAT1 ( Fig .
4B ) , and because NFAT2 and NFAT4 have been detected in cells of the immune system ( 17 , 42 , 61 ) , it remained formally possible that either NFAT2 or NFAT4 was contributing to the increased IL-4 gene transcription in primed CD4 T cells .
To address this possibility , we analyzed nuclear protein extracts from freshly isolated and in vitro-primed human peripheral blood CD4 T cells , before and after polyclonal activation in vitro , for NFAT2 and NFAT4 expression by Western blot analysis .
It was first confirmed that NFAT1 was markedly increased in €D4 T cells by in vitro priming , as detected by an NFAT 1-specific mAb directed against a unique epitope from the antisera used in Fig .
4D ( Fig .
7A ) .
By comparison , NFAT2 levels appeared to be decreased in the primed CD4 T cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
However , NFAT4 also appeared to be increased with priming , although to a lesser degree than NFAT1 ( Fig .
7C ) .
To test the functional significance of these results , freshly isolated CD4 T cells were transiently transfected with the pIL-4-Luc reporter gene and cotransfected with 10 ug of pREP-4 control , NFAT2/pREP-4 , or NFATA4/pREP-4 expression vectors .
Like NFAT1/pREP-4 ( Fig .
6A ) , NFAT2/pREP-4 was able to substantially ( ~4.5-fold ) augment IL-4 promoter-directed transcription in freshly isolated CD4 T cells relative to the pREP-4 control ( Fig .
6C ) .
In contrast , NFAT4/pREP-4 was consistently unable to augment IL-4 promoter-directed transcription ( Fig .
6C ) , while capable of increasing IL-2 promoter-directed transcription ( data not shown ) .
This may reflect the reported poor binding of NFAT4 to the IL-4 P1 element in vitro ( 14 ) .
Since NFAT2 can be substantially increased in response to T cell activation , it is possible that this protein may play a role in augmenting IL-4 transcription after NFAT1 acts initially ( 13 ) .
Thus , it appears as if NFAT1 is largely responsible for the initial NFAT-dependent increase in IL-4 expression by primed CD4 T cells from peripheral blood .

Moreover , the events leading to increased IL-4 production by T cell priming are of considerable interest , since IL-4 potentially regulates the outcome of the effector T cell immune response by its ability to promote Th2 differentiation and inhibit Th1 differentiation ( reviewed by Abbas et al .
in Ref .
66 ) .
The acquisition of an enhanced ability for cytokine gene transcription and production during T cell priming is critical for normal effector T cell function , although the mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood .
In this study we have focused on defining how priming increases IL-4 expression by human T cells , comparing molecular events involved in IL-4 gene transcription in freshly isolated peripheral blood CD4 T cells with those occurring when these cells have been primed in vitro .
We determined that the IL-4 gene 5 ' flank promoter segment was significantly more active in primed than fresh CD4 T cells , whereas the proximal human IL-2 gene promoter was equally active in both cell types .
In vivo footprint analysis of the proximal IL-4 promoter demonstrated activation-dependent engagement of the two most proximal NFAT -binding sites in primed but not fresh CD4 T cells .
In parallel , primed CD4 T cells contained more NFAT1 and directed more NFAT -driven transcription than fresh CD4 T cells .
Moreover , exogenous NFAT1 , achieved via transfection of expression plasmids , dramatically enhanced IL-A-mediated transcription by fresh CD4 T cells , but only modestly augmented IL-4 transcription in primed CD4 T cells .
This demonstrated that NFAT1 levels were limiting for IL-4 transcription by fresh €D4 T cells but adequate for IL-4 transcription by primed CD4 T cells .
Thus , the regulation of cellular NFAT levels appears to be a powerful , yet elegantly simple , mechanism by which to control the selective ability of primed/effector €D4 T cells to transcribe IL-4 and probably most other T cell-derived cytokines whose promoters possess NFAT-binding cis-elements .
The notable exception to this dictum is IL-2 .
The IL-2 promoter appears to be less selective in which NFAT proteins it can bind , allowing for transcription ( 16 ) .
Thus , the lack of NFAT1 in freshly isolated T cells may have little to no effect on IL-2 production , if , for example , NFAT2 or NFAT4 is available .
Furthermore , the IL-2 promoter may rely more on other transcription factors , such as NF- « B , for activation-dependent transcription ( 67 , 68 ) , while these same factors in the same cellular context may actually inhibit IL-4 promoter activity ( 69 ) .
Finally , it is possible that the IL-2 promoter may simply require lower levels of NFAT for binding and transactivation than the IL-4 promoter .
6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 868 Previously , sites of DNA-protein interactions involved in transcription of the proximal IL-2 promoter have been examined by in vivo footprinting ( 23 , 70 ) .
However , to the best of our knowledge , no in vivo footprinting of cytokine promoters has been performed with nontransformed T cells , nor has there been any previous reports of in vivo footprinting analysis of the proximal IL-4 promoter .
Our in vivo footprinting analysis of the two P elements closest to the IL-4 TSS , PO and P1 , revealed that after polyclonal activation both sites were clearly engaged in the primed CD4 T cell population .
Consistent with the DNA residues found to interact with NFAT based on the recently derived solution ( NFAT2 ) ( 71 , 72 ) and crystal ( NFAT1 ) ( 73 ) structures of NFAT , we found the identical three purine residues ( GGA ) of the PO and P1 elements were most consistently footprinted after activation .
In addition , both PO and P1 were shown to be independently critical for optimal IL-4 promoter activity by reporter gene analysis , similar to what has been previously shown for proximal P elements of the human CD4O-ligand promoter ( 27 ) and for corresponding sites in the murine IL-4 promoter ( 74 ) .
Thus , engagement of the two most proximal NFAT-binding P elements is critical for , and correlates with , IL-4 gene transcription by CD4 T cells .
The importance of the P1 element in IL-4 gene expression by effector T cells is also supported by recent murine experiments in which a P1 multimer-driven reporter transgene was active in effector T cells but not freshly isolated T cells ( 75 ) .
Previously , we and others have found the bulk of NFAT protein in peripheral T cells capable of binding P elements was NFAT1 ( 17 , 20 , 27 , 42 ) and the remainder was NFAT2 ( 41 , 42 , 76 ) .
In agreement with these results , supershift assays using the IL-4 P1 element oligonucleotide indicated that the vast majority of the complex formed with nuclear protein from fresh or primed T cells contained NFAT1 ( Fig .
4B ) .
Since NFAT proteins have been shown to bind to DNA in vitro as monomers ( 14 , 72 , 73 ) , this suggested that NFAT1 was the predominant NFAT species involved in binding to the proximal IL-4 P elements in vitro and , by inference , in vivo .
Moreover , primed T cells clearly possessed more protein binding activity for the IL-4 P1 element than did fresh T cells , whereas both cell populations had similar amounts of AP-1 protein binding activity .
This quantitative difference in NFAT1 may account for the ability to detect in vivo footprints of the proximal P elements in primed but not fresh CD4 T cells .
In addition to the quantitative differences in nuclear NFAT1 protein in the two cell types , qualitative differences were noted between nuclear NFAT1 protein from fresh and primed CD4 T cells , such that a significant portion of the nuclear NFAT1 from the primed CD4 T cells migrated at an apparent lower m.w .
Others have shown that lower m.w .
forms of NFAT detected after activation represent less phosphorylated proteins ( 19 , 62 ) .
The lower m.w .
NFAT1 protein detected in the nucleus of primed CD4 T cells most likely reflects a requirement for dephosphorylation of NFAT1 for its nuclear translocation and frans-activation , similar to NFAT4 ( 19 ) .
A requirement for dephosphorylation may also explain the lack of in vivo footprints in primed CD4 T cells before activation when higher m.w .
NFAT proteins are present in the nucleus .
The presence of NFAT proteins in the nucleus before activation has also recently been observed in murine T cells following priming with mitogen and exogenous IL-4 ( 60 ) , indicating that this observation is not unique to human T cells or the particular priming conditions we employed .
The presence of NFAT in the nucleus most likely reflects a balance between the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and nuclear kinases which enhance nuclear export of NFAT ( 19 , 77 ) .
Therefore , although priming of CD4 T cells results in quantitative differences in NFAT , qualitative alter NFAT ENHANCES IL-4 IN PRIMED CD4 T CELLS ations in NFAT may also be required for NFAT to bind to , and promote transcription of , the IL-4 promoter and gene , respectively .
Wild-type NFAT protein appears critical for optimal IL-4 transcription by primed CD4 T cells , in that expression of a form of NFAT1 lacking the amino-terminal frans-activation domain decreased IL-4 promoter activity .
Since this truncated NFAT1 protein retained its central DNA-binding domain ( 64 ) , it is likely that this protein interfered with IL-4 promoter activity by competing for binding to P elements , although its involvement at other steps of NFAT activation and/or nuclear translocation can not be ex-cluded .
Thus , binding of wild-type NFAT protein to the proximal P elements of the IL-4 promoter contributes to the ability of primed CD4 T cells to transcribe IL-4 mRNA .
This suggests that priming acts to increase IL-4 gene transcription by a NFAT-dependent mechanism .
Our results also clearly show that fresh CD4 T cells are relatively deficient in nuclear NFAT proteins after activation , and that this cell type 's limited ability for IL-4 promoter-directed transcription can be overcome by increased amounts of wild-type NFAT1 protein .
This finding suggests that NFAT1 may be critical for limiting expression of certain cytokines , such as IL-4 , to effector or memory T cell populations .
Our results suggest that there may be a threshold level of NFAT1 , lacking in fresh CD4 T cells but present in primed CD4 T cells , that is required for NFAT binding to the proximal P elements of the IL-4 promoter to initiate transcription .
If NFAT binding to P elements is competed by binding of neighboring inhibitory factors in fresh CD4 T cells , then a greater level of nuclear NFAT might be required in this cell type for sustained binding .
It is also possible that other transcription factors , scaffolding proteins , or modifiers of transcription factors or chromatin accessibility may also be required for P element binding by NFAT to the IL-4 promoter .
These proteins might be lacking in the nuclei of fresh CD4 T cells and might be preferentially increased in their activity or abundance by priming .
The recently identified NFAT-interacting protein ( NIP45 ) ( 78 ) or GATA-3 ( 79 ) may be such proteins .
Recently , three laboratories have independently generated mice that lack NFAT1 as a result of selective gene disruption ( 80-82 ) , but the effect of this complete NFAT1 deficiency on memory and effector T cell development has not been well characterized .
The expression of cytokines by T cells from two of these lines is reminiscent of the cytokine profile of fresh CD4 T cells .
In NFATI '~ mice challenged in vivo with a polyclonal stimulus ( anti-CD3e mAb ) , the T cells demonstrated early defective mRNA production of most all T cell-derived cytokines , except IL-2 ( 80 ) , and in similar NFATI '~ mice , splenocytes polyclonally activated in vitro for up to 2 days also demonstrated substantial defects in most cytokine mRNA while expressing normal levels of IL-2 message ( 82 ) .
This included the almost complete loss of transcripts for IL-4 , as well as substantial reductions in IL-5 , IL-13 , GM-CSF , TNF-a , CD40-ligand , and Fas-ligand mRNA ( 80 , 82 ) .
These cytokine genes contain one or more NFAT binding sites within their en-hancers or 5 ' flank promoters ( 11 ) , and , in most cases , expression of these cytokines is increased by T cell priming ( 8 , 9 , 20 , 83 ) .
In contrast , IL-2 transcript levels were only minimally reduced ( 80 , 82 ) .
These results are consistent with a model in which NFAT1 is limiting for most early cytokine gene expression , with the exception of IL-2 .
However , IL-4 gene transcription by polyclonally activated primary T cells was reported to be unaffected early in a third set of NFATI '~ mice , and actually increased at later time points ( 81 , 84 ) .
It remains unclear whether these markedly different results are attributable to differences in experimental design , the nature of the gene disruption used and its effects on intrathymic or extrathymic T cell maturation , or differences in compensatory 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology mechanisms for cytokine gene transcription among the three different knockout strains .
Clearly , under conditions of chronic stimulation , such as allergic challenge , NFAT1 is not essential for high levels of IL-4 production in vivo ( 81 , 85 ) .
However , all three independently generated NFATI '~ mouse strains have evidence of abnormally increased accumulation of peripheral T cells with age ( 80-82 ) , and , in at least one strain , increased expression of cell surface activation markers ( 86 ) .
This raises the possibility that T cell homeostasis is altered in these animals , perhaps due to the decreased expression of Fas-ligand ( 80 ) by NFATI '~ T cells .
Decreased fas-ligand or other alterations leading to decreased apoptosis of T cells in vivo ( 86 ) might perturb their priming for increased cytokine gene expression .
These results can be reconciled with our data with human CD4 T cells , assuming that NFAT1 has an early important role in the initiation of IL-4 gene transcription and a later role that directly or indirectly inhibits Th2 development in vivo .
In summary , priming of CD4 T cells increases IL-4 promoter-directed transcription , and significantly increases NFAT1 capable of binding the proximal P elements of the IL-4 promoter in vivo .
Addition of exogenous wild-type NFAT1 can partially overcome the comparative defect in IL-4 production by unprimed CD4 T cells , which are relatively NFAT Furthermore , dominant-negative experiments show the importance of wild-type NFAT for optimal IL-4 transcription in primed CD4 T cells .
Lastly , Western blot analysis reveals that priming increases NFAT1 and NFAT4 , but not NFAT2 , levels in CD4 T cells , and NFAT4 does not appear capable of substantially increasing IL-4 promoter-directed gene transcription in normal human CD4 T cells .
Together with the results observed in NFATI '~ mice ( 80 , 82 ) , these results suggest that the increase in NFAT1 with priming may not only contribute to increased IL-4 production , but may also contribute globally to the enhanced production of most T cell-derived cytokines by effector CD4 T cells .
