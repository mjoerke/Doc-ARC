19 ) ; L1040-L1050 , 1998.-Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation supports gas exchange in patients with respiratory failure but is also responsible for significant lung injury .
In this study , we have developed an in vitro model in which isolated lung cells can be submitted to a prolonged cyclic pressure-stretching strain resembling that of conventional mechanical ventilation .
In this model , cells cultured on a Silastic membrane were elongated up to 7 % of their initial diameter , corresponding to a 12 % increase in cell surface .
The lung macrophage was identified as the main cellular source for critical inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- « , the chemokines interleukin ( IL ) -8 and -6 , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in this model system of mechanical ventilation .
These mediators were measured in supernatants from ventilated alveolar macrophages , monocyte-derived macrophages , and promonocytic THP-1 cells .
Nuclear factor-kB was found to be activated in ventilated macrophages .
Synergistic proinflammatory effects of mechanical stress and molecules such as bacterial endotoxin were observed , suggesting that mechanical ventilation might be particularly deleterious in preinjured or infected lungs .
Dexamethasone prevented IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-a secretion in ventilated macrophages .
Mechanical ventilation induced low levels of IL-8 secretion by alveolar type II-like cells .
Other lung cell types such as endothelial cells , bronchial cells , and fibroblasts failed to produce IL-8 in response to a prolonged cyclic pressure-stretching load .
This model is of particular value for exploring physical stress-induced signaling pathways , as well as for testing the effects of novel ventilatory strategies or adjunctive substances aimed at modulating cell activation induced by mechanical ventilation .
alveolar macrophages ; tumor necrosis factor-a ; interleukin-8 ; interleukin-6 ; nuclear factor-kB ; metalloproteinases ; ventilator-induced lung injury ; acute respiratory distress syndrome THE OUTCOME OF PATIENTS with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and other types of respiratory failure has been markedly improved by the utilization of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation ( 19 ) .
However , mechanical ventilation can itself lead to serious complications due to increased intrathoracic pressure and air space distension .
Direct injuries can occur , such as blood-gas barrier disruption and pneumothorax ( 10 , 13 ) , but the lung can also be injured indirectly by The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

L1040 the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs ( 21 , 22 ) .
Two different types of stress induced by mechanical ventilation are thought to occur : 1 ) overstretching of small airways and alveoli due to increased volumes in some regions of the lung and 2 ) cycles of repeated opening and closing of alveolar groups in other regions , causing severe wall stress and surfactant depletion ( 29 , 32 ) .
Cell responses to mechanical stress such as shear stress have been studied during the past decade .
It has been demontrated that sheared endothelial cells produce inflammatory mediators ( 43 , 53 , 62 ) .
Shear stress-responding elements have been identified in the promoter regions of inflammatory genes ( 43 , 52 ) .
The effects of cell stretching have also been studied in various cell systems ( 20 , 24 , 28 , 48 , 58 , 60 ) .
On the other hand , positive-pressure mechanical ventilation induces a complex pressure-stretching strain in the cells different from this well-studied shear stress .
None-theless , recent animal studies suggest that mechanical ventilation may induce the production of inflammatory mediators by lung cells .
For example , injurious ventilatory strategies applied to isolated rodent lungs lead to the alveolar secretion of various proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - « , interleukin ( IL ) -1B , IL-6 , and IL-8 ( 57 , 59 ) .
In a model of surfactant depletion in rabbits , it was shown that granulocytes participated in ventilator-induced lung injury ( 21 , 22 ) .
The aim of our study was to determine the capacity of lung cells to secrete inflammatory mediators when subjected to a cyclic pressure-stretching strain resembling that induced by mechanical ventilation .
Using an in vitro model of mechanical ventilation of cell monolay-ers , we have identified the macrophage as the likely cellular source for the secretion of proinflammatory mediators in response to mechanical ventilation .
Macrophages respond to pressure-stretching strain by secreting the chemokine IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 .
Mechanical ventilation does not directly induce TNF- « and IL-6 but synergizes with other inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial endotoxin to stimulate the secretion of these mediators .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plastic Lung Model A `` plastic lung '' was designed to reproduce the cyclic pressure-stretching regimen induced by mechanical ventilation .
This plastic lung was made of transparent Plexiglas ( Fig .
1 ) .
The bottom of the chamber was engineered to reproduce a double six-well plate ( 12 wells of 3.5-cm diameter each ) , with the exception that the bottom of the wells was 1040-0605/98 $ 5.00 Copyright © 1998 the American Physiological Society Downloaded from www.physiclogy.org/journal/ajplung ( 173.236.240.127 ) on May 10 , 2019 .

View of closed ( A ) and open ( B ) `` plastic lung . ''
composed of a Bioflex Silastic , distensible , optically clear membrane ( Flexcell International , McKeesport , PA ) .
The same membrane is used in the Flexercell strain system , a stretching device with BioFlex plates bottomed with these membranes , and used for cyclic cell stretching ( Flexcell International ) ( 20 , 60 ) .
Two holes were made in the lateral wall of the chamber .
The first was connected to a noncollaps-ible size 6.0 endotracheal tube ( Laserflex tracheal tube , Mallinckrodt Medical , St. Louis , MO ) , and the second was connected to a pressure transducer and a graphic recorder ( Gould Instrument Systems , Valley View , OH ) , allowing on-line monitoring of the pressure regimen inside the chamber .
For culturing cells before mechanical ventilation in a 5 % CO ; , 100 % humidity atmosphere , the first hole was obturated and the second hole was connected to a 0.2-um filter ( Millex GV , Millipore , Molsheim , France ) .
During mechanical ventilation experiments , the chamber was bolted down to the bottom part in an airtight manner and connected to a regular intensive care adult ventilator ( Evita 2 , Dragerwerk , Liibeck , Germany ) .
CO ; was added to the inspiratory circuit of the ventilator , adjusted to an inspired fraction of 5 % , and monitored in the expired air with a Normocap apparatus ( Datex Instrumentarium , Helsinki , Finland ) throughout the proto-col .
The inspired fraction of 0 ; of the ventilator was adjusted to ensure a 21 % O ; , concentration in the plastic lung to compensate for the CO ; admixture .
The inspired air was kept moist at 37°C with a heatable respiratory humidifier ( MR700 , Fisher & Paykel Healthcare , Auckland , New Zealand ) and a Pall heat and moisture exchange filter ( BB25 filter , Pall , Muttenz , Switzerland ) connected between the inspiratory limb of the ventilator and the Y piece .
The plastic lung was kept in a 37°C incubator throughout cell ventilation .
The temperature inside the chamber was checked several times and was always found to be 37°C .
The Pall filter also prevented potential bacterial contamination of the plastic L1041 B lung chamber during ventilation .
The ventilatory circuit , the Y piece , and the chamber of the respiratory humidifier were treated with 70 % ethanol overnight before each ventilation experiment .
Only endotoxin-free sterile distilled water was used for humidification of the inspired air .
The day before cell ventilation , the plastic lung was sterilized with 70 % ethanol and ultraviolet exposure ( > 1 h ) , and rinsed three times with sterile distilled water and once with PBS , pH 7.4 .
The cells were then seeded in the wells of the plastic lung or in BioFlex plates for control static conditions ( see Cells for cell types and specific culture conditions ) and cultured in a 37°C , 5 % CO ; , 100 % humidity atmosphere .
The next day , the plastic lung was connected to the ventilator .
The cells were ventilated in a controlled mode at a frequency of 20 cycles/min with an inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio of 1:1 , an inspiratory flow of 90 l/min , and a maximum pressure limit of 80 emH ; 0 .
This corresponded to a peak and a plateau pressure of ~70 emH ; 0 , a tidal volume of 280-300 ml , and a minute ventilation of 5.6-6 l/min in the plastic lung .
Experiments were also performed with pressures of 40 and 20 ecmH30 in the plastic lung .
Mean stretching of the Silastic membrane was calculated according to the following formula : mean stretching = [ surface of the sphere zone of the disk ( =1r2 ) ] - 1 ; because AD # = r* + A2 , then stretching = A*/r* , where r is the radius and / is the height .

L1042 Using a small plastic stick of negligible mass with a millimet-ric scale , we measured a central vertical excursion of 6 mm during the `` inspiratory pressure plateau '' of 70 emH ; 0 , which corresponded to a mean stretching of 12 % ; i.e. , the surface of the inflated membrane was 12 % greater than that of the noninflated membrane .
Because of the physical properties of the Silastic membrane and the limitation of pressures generated by the ventilator , maximum mean stretch was limited to 12-15 % in this model .
In other systems of cell stretching , this amount of stretch is associated with maximal biological cell responses ( 20 , 24 , 28 , 58 ) .
In the Silastic membrane used in our studies , the radial strain profile is not uniform .
Cells are more elongated in the periphery compared with those in the center ( 15 ) .
A pressure-volume curve of the system was established , and the compliance of the plastic lung was measured at 10 ml/cmH,0 , which corresponds to a `` stiff lung . ''
According to the pressure-volume curve , ventilation of the plastic lung was performed in the linear portion of the curve .
Validation of Cell Stretching To validate our plastic lung model , primary alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) were cultured on Silastic membranes in BioFlex six-well plates ( Flexcell International ) and stretched under direct microscopic vision .
The lid from the six-well plate was sealed to the bottom part with silicon glue in an airtight fashion , and a hole was drilled into the lid .
A rigid plastic catheter was connected to it and also sealed with silicon glue .
This catheter was connected to a syringe and a pressure-monitoring system .
Sealed BioFlex plates were then put under an Axiovert 100TV phase-contrast microscope ( Zeiss ) in a 37°C heated chamber and connected to a digital-imaging system ( Hamamatsu digital camera 4742-95 ) .
The Silastic membranes were progressively `` inflated '' with the syringe with increasing air volumes to obtain the following pressure increments inside the `` chamber '' : 0 , 12 , 25 , 45 , 60 , and 75 emH,0 .
One AM was imaged at a time .
The focus was constantly readjusted during membrane inflation , and the vertical excursion was recorded for each pressure level .
At maximal pressure , vertical excursions were on the order of 5-7 mm , corresponding to those measured in the plastic lung with similar pressures .
Images of stretched AMs were recorded at all pressures .
Cell diameter and surface were measured in pixels with the Openlab software ( Improvision ) and converted to micrometers and square micrometers , respec-tively , according to the magnification factor used to view the cell ( at X32 magnification , 478 pixels = 100 um ) .
Percent cell stretch ( elongation ) at a given pressure was defined as [ ( d at a given pressure - d at zero pressure ) /d at zero pressure ] X 100 , where d is the cell diameter .
For cells imaged on the periphery of the Silastic membrane , the correction of the cell surface due to the angle of the Silastic membrane with that of the horizontal plane due to membrane inflation was ne-glected .
Cells Human AMs were obtained by lavage from lungs removed from patients with lung cancer as described elsewhere ( 34 ) .
All donors were current smokers or had quit smoking re-cently .
Briefly , healthy lobes of these lungs were lavaged with 0.15 M NaCl shortly after the operation .
The cells were then pelleted , washed with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml of penicillin , and 50 pg/ml of streptomycin ( culture medium ; GIBCO , Basel , Swit-zerland ) .
The cells were then seeded onto plastic surfaces MECHANICAL VENTILATION-INDUCED MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION ( 6-well regular plastic Falcon plates or BioFlex plates with a Silastic bottom membrane ; Flexcell International ) at a density of 2 X 105 cells/cm '' .
This procedure yielded > 95 % pure AMs as determined by a specific esterase-staining method .
Human monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) were obtained from buffy coats of healthy blood donors .
Peripheral blood monocytic cells were purified with a classic Ficoll technique , washed in culture medium , and distributed onto plastic or Silastic surfaces to obtain a macrophage cell density comparable to that of AMs ( see above ) .
After a 45-min incubation at 37°C , lymphocytes were washed away , leaving adherent MDMs .
MDMs rested 24 h before change of medium and cell stimulation .
In some experiments , the glucocorticoid ( GC ) dexamethasone ( 1 ug/ml ; Organon ) was used to pretreat ( 2 h ) MDMs and AMs .
Nonadherent promonocytic human THP-1 cells [ 2 x 10° cells/em* ; American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) , Manas-sas , VA ) ( 2 ) were seeded onto Silastic membranes in the presence of 10 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate ( PMA ; Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) .
This treatment rendered cells firmly adherent .
After 18 h , the medium was changed , and the cells rested for 30 h , the time necessary for chemokine and cytokine levels to return to their basal levels .
Mechanical ventilation and stimulation with agonists was then performed in fresh medium .
Escherichia coli 0111 : B4 lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; 200 ng/ml ; List , Campbell , CA ) was used as a positive control for MDM , AM , and THP-1 cell stimulation .
In other experiments , the following adherent cell types were tested : human type II-like epithelial A459 cells ( ATCC ) , EA.hy926 endothelial cells ( 12 ) cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and antibi-otics , human bronchial BET-1A cells ( ATCC ) cultured in LHC-9 medium ( Biofluids , Rockville , MD ) ( 49 ) , and human primary lung fibroblasts cultured in their corresponding medium ( Clonetics , Walkersville , MD ) .
PMA and/or recombinant IL-1B ( kindly provided by J.-M. Dayer , University of Geneva , Switzerland ) were used as positive controls for endothelial cells , epithelial cells , and fibroblasts .
Mechanical Ventilation of Cells On the day of assay , the cells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium and ventilated for 32 h in 3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 % fetal bovine serum .
This volume of medium covered the cells during the whole cycle of mechanical ventilation .
Experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition and time point .
Each experiment was performed most often three times but at least two times .
Data are expressed as means + SD .
Conditioned medium was sampled at 8 , 24 , and sometimes 32 h and centrifuged at 4°C .
Supernatants were divided into aliquots and kept frozen at -70°C until the day of assay .
In all experiments , cells were seeded at the same density in parallel onto six-well BioFlex plates ( same Silastic membrane as in the plastic lung ) and kept in a 37°C incubator ( static controls ) .
Positive controls ( addition of 200 ng/ml of LPS for macrophages and 2 ng/ml of IL-1 or 100 ng/ml of PMA for the other cell types at time 0 ) were performed in parallel with the mechanical ventilation both in the plastic lung and in static control conditions .
Cells submitted to ventilation or in the static plates were found to be > 95 % viable after 32 h as assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method .
In addition , lactate dehydrogenase activity ( measured by the classic pyruvate-to-lactate method ) in supernatants from macrophages ventilated for up to 32 h did not increase significantly , indicating the absence of a cyto-toxic effect of mechanical ventilation in our model system .

MECHANICAL VENTILATION-INDUCED MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION Measurement of Inflammatory Markers ELISAs .
Human TNF-a levels in conditioned supernatants were measured by a sandwich ELISA technique with a pair of monoclonal antibodies according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) .
The limit of detection of the TNF assay was 40 pg/ml .
Human IL-8 levels in conditioned supernatants were measured by a sandwich ELISA technique with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human IL-8 antibody ( a kind gift of S. L. Kunkel , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI ) as described elsewhere ( 838 ) .
Human IL-6 and IL-10 were measured in conditioned supernatants with ELISA techniques based on monoclonal antibody pairs and protocols obtained from Endogen ( Woburn , MA ) .
The limit of detection was 10 pg/ml for the three assays .
MMPs .
Levels of MMP-9 were determined by the quantification of the gelatinolytic band obtained in gelatin zymograms of conditioned supernatants ( 8 , 41 ) .
Quantification was performed with a Molecular Dynamic densitometer and Image-Quant software , and relative MMP-9 concentrations are expressed as arbitrary density units .
Nuclear factor- « B activation .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described ( 39 ) .
Briefly , MDMs in static conditions and MDMs ventilated in the presence and absence of LPS were collected by cell scraping at different times ( 30 , 60 , and 120 min ) and chilled in ice-cold PBS , pH 7.3 .
Nuclear proteins were obtained with a first extraction with an anti-protease- and Triton X-100-contain-ing lysis buffer and a second extraction with a high salt-containing buffer .
Three micrograms of nuclear proteins were mixed with trace amounts of *°P-labeled nuclear factor-kB ( NF-kB ) oligonucleotide probe ( Promega ) in the presence of salmon sperm DNA ( Sigma ) and poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) and were analyzed on 5 % acrylamide gels made in Tris-glycine-EDTA .
Electrophoresed gels were then transferred onto What-man paper , dried , and subjected to autoradiography .
RESULTS Visualization of Cell Stretching Using direct microscopic observation and recording of macrophages cultured on Silastic membrane submitted to stretch , we could demonstrate that the cell diameter and surface progressively increased with volume-pressure load increments to a level similar to that of the membrane itself ( Fig .
2 ) .
At 75 emH ; 0 pressure , macrophages were elongated by a factor of 7.1 + 0.4 % ( cell diameter ) , corresponding to an increase in cell surface of 11.8 + 2 % .
This value of cell stretching is in accordance with the calculated Silastic membrane stretching when similar pressures were applied to the plastic lung ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) .
Cytokine Response to Mechanical Ventilation AMs .
Of the different cell types submitted to mechanical ventilation , AMs were the cells responding the most .
IL-8 secretion was chosen as a marker for ventilator-induced lung inflammation because this chemokine is the most potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and because neutrophil recruitment has been observed in lungs submitted to positive-pressure mechanical ventilation .
AMs produced elevated IL-8 levels in response to pressure-stretching cyeli¢ strain ( Fig .

mechanical stress .
TNF-a and IL-6 were produced by AMs in response to LPS but not after mechanical ventilation , suggesting a differential response to mechanical ventilation between IL-8 and both TNF-a and IL-6 .
A marked synergistic effect on the secretion of both TNF- « and IL-6 was observed when LPS was added to ventilated cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Importantly , the absence of TNF-a measured in ventilated macrophages over a period of 32 h made very unlikely the possibility of LPS contamination of the plastic lung .
In addition , endotoxin levels were consistently found to be =0.05 endotoxin unit/ml ( Limulus assay lysate ; BioWhit-taker ) in supernatants from ventilated macrophages .
The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was produced only after 24 h by AMs in response to LPS ( Fig .
3 ) .

Ventilated MDMs produced IL-8 levels similar to those induced by LPS in the same cells under static conditions .
A small additive effect of the two stimuli was observed .
Similar to observations made in AMs , mechanical ventilation per se did not induce TNF- « and IL-6 in MDMs , but the secretion of these cytokines induced by LPS was markedly enhanced by mechanical ventilation ( data not shown ) .
MDMs ventilated with different driving pressures indicated that 20 emH ; 0 induced only slightly elevated IL-8 levels at 24 h , whereas 40 and 80 emH,0 induced similar elevated levels of IL-8 at 8 and 24 h ( Fig .

This would have the advantage of setting a reproducible model independent of interindividual differences in cellular responses and that could generate genetically modified cells with transfection , for example ( 389 ) .
We established conditions in which THP-1 could be rendered adherent to the Silastic membrane with the phorbol ester PMA , without persistent cell activation .
Adherent THP-1 cells submitted to mechanical ventilation showed activation patterns very similar to those observed in AMs and MDMs ( Fig .
7 ) .
Ventilated THP-1 cells secreted IL-8 but not TNF-a or IL-6 .
The addition of LPS and mechanical ventilation resulted in a marked enhancement of TNF-a , IL-8 , and IL-6 production compared with LPS alone ( Fig .
7 ) .
Seventy-two-hour macrophage differentiation of THP-1 cells by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 2 ) did not modify the pattern of cell response to mechanical ventilation but increased cytokine levels by a factor of ~8 ( data not shown ) .
NF-kB Activation by Mechanical Ventilation The secretion of many proinflammatory cytokines depends on the activation of nuclear factors such as NF- « kB .
Once activated , the latter translocates into the nucleus and binds to specific NF- « B DNA sequences present in the promoter region of cytokine genes ( 27 , 31 ) .
has been implicated in the activation of cells in response to mechanical stress such as endothelial shear stress ( 23 ) .
We tested the hypothesis that NF-KB could be activated by a cyclic pressure-stretching force applied to MDMs and thereby be implicated in cellular responses to cyclic pressure-stretching strain .
In Fig .
8 , we show that NF- « B was activated in MDMs as early as 30 min after the initiation of mechanical ventilation and persisted for as long as 2 h. Blocking Mechanical Ventilation-Induced Cell Activation With GCs GCs exert their anti-inflammatory effects , at least in part , via the inhibition of NF- < B activation in response to various proinflammatory stimuli ( 1 ) .

Effect of Mechanical Ventilation on Other Cell Types Several other human cell types , which might theoretically be of importance in biological responses to distended airways , were tested in the plastic lung .
These included endothelial cells , epithelial cells , and fibroblasts .
Only the type II-like A549 epithelial cells responded to mechanical ventilation by secreting low levels of IL-8 after 24 h , whereas the same cells produced high IL-8 levels in response to PMA ( Fig .

With identical cell culture and ventilation protocols as those used for macrophages , neither IL-8 nor IL-6 were produced in response to mechanical ventilation by endothelial EA.hy926 cells , bronchial BET-1A cells , and primary lung fibroblasts , whereas all these cells were capable of secreting IL-8 in response to other stimuli ( recombinant IL-1B or PMA ; data not shown ) .

MECHANICAL VENTILATION-INDUCED MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION cellular basis for ventilator-induced lung inflammation .
The lung macrophage was identified as an important mechanosensor , responding to pressure-stretching cyclic load by secreting critical inflammatory mediators such as IL-8 , TNF-a , IL-6 , and MMP-9 .
A key transcription factor , NF- « < B , was also activated in these cells .
In ARDS , large portions of the lung consist of alveoli that are collapsed at end expiration and open during inspiration , whereas other areas are condensed and never open and others still are close to normal .
Thus , during mechanical ventilation , the former lung zones undergo cyclic opening and closing and probably sustain damage due to high wall stress forces , whereas the latter receive most of the tidal volume and are at risk of overdistension during inspiration ( 14 , 46 ) .
New ventilatory strategies were recently developed with the aim of minimizing overdistension ( pressure-targeted ventilation , low-volume ventilation ) ( 29 , 30 ) and opening-closing cycles of alveolar groups ( positive end-expiratory pressure ) ( 14 , 25 , 61 ) .
Experimental data exist to support lung injury induced by both phenomena .
In various animal models and in vitro cell experiments , including some with lung-derived cells , cell stretching induces proinflammatory mediators , cellular proliferation , or cellular injury ( 18 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 48 , 58 , 60 ) .
Conversely , in animal models where rapid alveolar opening was induced , the lungs were either significantly injured ( 61 ) or responded by the secretion of proinflammatory mediators ( 59 ) .
In the latter situation , it has been calculated that wall stress during alveolar opening corresponded to a transmural pressure of ~140 emH ; 0O applied to the cells ( 82 ) .
In an ex vivo isolated rat lung model , Tremblay et al .
( 57 ) recently measured increased TNF- « , IL-1B , IL-6 , and IL-8 in lung lavages after injurious ventilatory regi-mens .
Maximum cytokine production was observed in lung lavage from animals ventilated with large vol-umes , with an end-expiratory lung volume below the lower inflection point of the pressure-volume curve , where cycles of opening and closing of alveolar groups occur ( 57 ) .
Our in vitro model was designed to combine both pressure and stretch forces , simulating the in vivo situation of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation .
Using this model , we first tested whether IL-8 , a potent neutrophil chemoattractant produced by various lung cell types ( 7 , 40 , 54 ) , could be upregulated in response to mechanical forces resembling those of mechanical ventilation .
IL-8 was chosen as a relevant mediator because a hallmark of ventilator-induced lung injury is the lung recruitment of neutrophils and neutrophil-mediated tissue injury ( 21 , 22 ) .
In addition , elevated IL-8 levels were measured in the alveolar space of patients ventilated for ARDS ( 9 , 33 ) .
Of the different cell types tested , the macrophage was the strongest IL-8 producer in response to mechanical stress .
This is not a complete surprise because this cell already integrates various other stresses ( bacterial molecules , proinflammatory cytokines , osmotic shock , pH variations ) ( 16 ) .
Interestingly , TNF- « and IL-6 could not be induced directly by mechanical ventilation of macro L1047 phages but required an inflammatory costimulus for a synergistic response .
Although IL-8 and TNF- « are usually secreted in parallel after myeloid cell activa-tion , a differential regulation of these two cytokines has been described in circulating leukocytes ( 6 ) .
These findings suggest that mechanical ventilation may induce limited inflammation in normal lungs , mainly IL-8-dependent recruitment of neutrophils , but may well augment lung inflammation to clinically important levels in preinjured or infected lungs .
Supporting this hypothesis , two groups have demonstrated in rats that a previous lung alteration ( oleic acid or the toxic a « -naphthylthiourea ) was associated with a marked ventilation-induced lung injury , with massive lung edema , compared with that of the toxin alone or high-volume ventilation alone ( 11 , 17 ) .
On the basis of the observations made in our studies , it can be concluded that macrophages are sensitive to cyclic pressure stretching , a mechanical strain resembling that of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation .
However , we can not ascertain that the AM is the cell playing the major role in the initiation of ventilator-induced lung injury .
First , these cells are loosely adherent because they are easily collected by bronchoalveolar lavage .
Second , it was shown by Tremblay et al .
( 57 ) that TNF- « mRNA induced by an injurious ventilatory regimen in isolated rat lungs was not decreased by a depletion of AMs collected by bronchoalveolar lavage .
The macrophage seems , however , to be a strong candidate because injurious ventilatory regimens consistently induced TNF secretion in animal airways ( 55 , 57 , 59 ) and because TNF- « is essentially produced by myeloid cells .
To reconcile these data , we hypothesize that the interstitial macrophage may play an important role as a mechanosensor in the lung .
ARDS is also characterized by profound tissue remodeling in both its early and late phases ( 87 , 45 ) .
We tested the hypothesis that mechanical cell stresses induced the secretion of enzymes important for lung remodeling .
MMPs are enzymes that degrade extracel-lular matrix components and basement membranes and are found at elevated levels in the alveolar spaces of patients with ARDS ( 44 , 56 ) .
MMP-9 is a type IV collagenase that is produced mainly by neutrophils and macrophages ( 35 ) and epithelial cells ( 63 ) .
The epithe-lial-derived MMP-9 was shown to actively contribute to lung repair processes ( 5 ) .
Whereas neutrophils secrete MMP by degranulation , the MMP-9 secreted by macrophages is tightly regulated and requires de novo enzyme synthesis ( 42 , 47 ) .
In the present study , we showed that , in addition to known proinflammatory mediators , a pressure-stretching stimulus induced MMP-9 secretion after 24 h in human macrophages .
Pardo et al .
( 86 ) demonstrated that additional collagenase transcripts ( MMP-1 and MMP-2 ) were upregulated in rat lungs ventilated with high volumes .
It is still unclear what triggers intracellular signaling events , and a membrane or intracellular mechano-receptor ( s ) remains to be discovered ( 3 ) .
Second messengers and signal transduction pathways have been studied in some detail in mechanical stresses such as Downloaded from www.physiclogy.org/journal/ajplung ( 173.236.240.127 ) on May 10 , 2019 .
L1048 endothelial fluid shear stress ( 50 ) .
In this latter example , mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades are turned on , leading to the activation of various transcription factors ( 26 ) .
Different DNA `` shear stress-respond-ing elements '' have been identified in the promoter region of sensitive genes ( 43 , 51 ) , including 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-responding element ( activator protein-1 ) ( 52 ) and NF- « kB DNA binding domain ( 23 ) .
Less is known about activation pathways during cell stretching .
In experiments performed in MDMs submitted to cyclic pressure stretching , we observed the activation and nuclear translocation of NF- « kB .
This transcription factor has been implicated as a critical factor for the activation of various inflammatory genes including IL-8 and MMP-9 ( 31 ) , the same genes that were shown to respond to mechanical ventilation .
However , it does not seem sufficient because IL-6 and TNF- « , which both have NF- < B consensus DNA sequences in their promoter region , were not directly activated by cell stretching .
We did not observe activated activator protein-1 in nuclear extracts from ventilated macrophages ( Dunn and Pugin , unpublished data ) .
GCs exert their anti-inflammatory properties , at least partially , via blockade of activation and nuclear translocation ( 4 ) .
In the present work , we observed that dexamethasone blocked both NF- < B activation and cytokine production by cells submitted to mechanical ventilation or to a combined cell stress , i.e. , mechanical ventilation and bacterial endotoxin .
This indicated that common distal activation pathways were utilized by proinflammatory cell stresses such as LPS and mechanical stresses and that both agonists could be blocked with a GC .
This may also have some implications in the pharmacological treatment of ventilator-induced lung inflammation .
Of the various other cell types present in the lung parenchyma , only the alveolar type II-like A549 cells responded , albeit poorly , to pressure stretching .
A similar observation was made by another group ( 18 ) with stretched A549 cells .
Their weak IL-8 response might be related to the loss by these immortalized cells of important functions or molecules critical for mechanical strain responses .
Human primary type II or type I cells would be of great interest to test in our model ; however , these cells can not be isolated with the degree of purity needed for such studies .
Human bronchial epithelial BET-1A cells were shown to produce IL-8 after cell deformation and detachment ( 49 ) but failed to secrete that chemokine when ventilated .
The absence of an IL-8 response in endothelial cells is also puzzling , although again the cells that we tested were derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fused with A549 cells ( 12 ) and thus might not reflect the response of capillary pulmonary endothelial cells .
Supporting this fact , endothelial cells from different vascular beds have different responses to stretching ( 20 ) .
Using microscopic-imaging technology , we could clearly demonstrate that in our model macrophages cultured on Silastic membranes were actually stretched when the membrane was inflated and that cell stretch MECHANICAL VENTILATION-INDUCED MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION ing was certainly a main determinant for cell activation .
However , this model has limitations : it clearly oversimplifies the lung stucture and the complex forces exerted on lung cells during the process of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation .
In addition , the true percent stretch of alveolar and interstitial cells during mechanical ventilation is not known and probably varies considerably from one territory to the other .
On the other hand , our model has the advantage of simplicity and the potential for addressing focused questions with purified primary cells or cell lines in a mechanically active environment resembling that of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation .
It may also allow one to dissect the signal transduction pathway of cells activated by a cyclic pressure-stretching strain .
In conclusion , the model described in this study led to the identification of the AM as a likely important cellular source for proinflammatory mediators produced in response to mechanical ventilation .
This provides a potential molecular and cellular basis for the ventilator-induced lung inflammation and remodeling theory .
Our model is particularly suitable for further studies on signaling pathways and gene regulation in response to a pressure-stretching strain and to test the effect of ventilator settings and therapeutics on the mechanical stress-induced cell activation .
