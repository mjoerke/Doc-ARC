Cantrell From the Lymphocyte Activation Laboratory , Imperial Cancer Research Fund , London , WC2A 3PX , England and the *Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 Summary In T lymphocytes , triggering of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) induces several signaling cascades which ultimately synergize to induce the activity of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a DNA binding complex critical to the inducibility and T cell specificity of the T cell growth factor interleukin 2 .
One immediate consequence of T cell activation via the TCR is an increase in cytosolic calcium .
Calcium signals are important for NFAT induction , and recent studies have identified calcineurin , a calcium-calmodulin dependent serine-threonine phosphatase , as a prominent component of the calcium signaling pathway in T cells .
A second important molecule in TCR signal transduction is the guanine nucleotide binding protein , p21 '' , which is coupled to the TCR by a protein tyrosine kinase dependent mechanism .
The experiments presented here show that expression by transfection of mutationally activated calcineurin or activated p21 '' alone is insufficient for NFAT transactivation .
However , coexpression of the activated calcineurin with activated p21 '' ® could mimic TCR signals in NFAT induction .
These data identify calcineurin and p21 '' '' as cooperative partners in T cell activation .
lymphocyte growth is controlled by the cytokine interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) .
Quiescent T cells do not express the IL-2 gene ( 1 ) .
After T cell activation via the T cell receptor for antigen ( TCR ) , there is transcriptional induction of IL-2 gene expression ( 2 ) .
The target for TCR-derived signals in the IL-2 gene is a T cell-specific transcriptional enhancer located in a region 275 bp 5 '' of the gene ( 3 ) .
The cooperative activity of at least eight proteins that interact with this enhancer appears to control IL-2 gene transcription ( 4 ) .
Several of these proteins , such as AP-1 , NFKB , and Oct-1 are ubiquitous and regulate gene transcription in many cells .
However , a protein complex termed the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) ' has been identified that seems to determine both the T cell specificity and inducibility of IL-2 gene regulation ( 5 ) .
In particular , NFAT is a specific target for the TCR-derived signals that control IL-2 gene expression .
NFAT is thought to be composed of two proteins : one is T cell-specific , cytoplasmic , and translocates to the nucleus upon T cell acti-vation ; the other is apparently a member of the AP1 family of transcriptional factors ( i.e. , Fos/Jun ) , predominantly nu-clear , and present only in activated cells ( 6-10 ) .
The expression of a functional NFAT complex in T cells 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : CAT , chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ; CNA , wild type calcineurin A subunit ; CNB , wild type calcineurin B subunit ; CNM , calcineurin A mutant ; NFAT , nuclear factor of activated T cells ; PKC , protein kinase C ; PTK , protein tyrosine kinase .
is controlled by synergistic signaling pathways initiated by the TCR ( 11 ) .
The immediate signaling consequences of TCR triggering include activation of protein tyrosines kinases ( PTKs ) , which facilitates the rapid elevation of intracellular calcium concentration and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( 12 ) .
Calcium and PKC are important signals in T cell activation since pharmacological agents such as calcium iono-phores and phorbol esters , that elevate intracellular calcium and activate PKC , respectively , can bypass the requirements for TCR triggering and synergize to induce a functional NFAT complex ( 13 , 14 ) .
A third signaling pathway that involves the guanine nucleotide binding proteins p21 '' also originates from the TCR ( 15-18 ) .
The Ras proteins rapidly accumulate in an activated GTP-bound state upon TCR triggering and also in response to stimulation of PKC .
However , although the TCR induces PKC activation , PKC does not appear to mediate TCR regulation of p21 '' ( 19 ) .
Instead , the TCR couples to p21 '' via a PKC-independent mechanism requiring the integrity of TCR-regulated PTKs .
In recent studies , it has been shown that Ras function is essential for TCR signal transduction as judged by the demonstration that expression of a dominant inhibitory mutant of p21 '' , N17 ras , prevents TCR induction of NFAT and the IL-2 gene ( 20 , 21 ) .
Moreover , expression of a constitutively activated Ras protein , p21 '' , has a dominant positive effect on NFAT induction and is able to generate a signal 1517 __ J. Exp .

The calcium-regulated signals that cooperate with p21 '' to induce NFAT have not yet been identified .
However , a component of the calcium signal that is essential for TCR induction of NFAT has recently been identified .
The calcium-calmodulin dependent phosphatase calcineurin ( 22-25 ) , which is the major cellular target for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 in vivo , is activated in response to TCR triggering or stimulation of cells with calcium ionophore ( 26 ) .
The expression of a truncated constitutively active Ca**-independent catalytic subunit of calcineurin generates a signal that can substitute for calcium signals and synergize with phorbol esters to induce the IL-2 gene ( 22 ) .
Overexpression of wild type calcineurin can also augment TCR-induced NFAT -dependent transcription ( 23 ) .
The potential for p21 '' * '' to cooperate with calcineurin has not yet been explored , but activation of ras is a good candidate for the physiological partner for calcineurin in NFAT induction for at least two reasons .
First , p21 '' , like calcineurin , has an essential function in TCR regulation of NFAT ( 21 ) .
Second , p21 '' can replace some requirements for phorbol ester activation of PKC in NFAT induction .
Accord-ingly , the object of the present study was to examine the potential for p21 '' and calcineurin to synergize during T cell activation and substitute for the TCR in the induction of NFAT .
The present data show that in two T cell lines , the human leukemia Jurkat and the murine thymoma EL4 , expression of either constitutively active p21 '' or a constitutively active calcineurin is not alone sufficient for NFAT transcription .
However , in combination , activated p21 ' '' and calcineurin can synergize to give induction of NFAT that mimics the response induced by TCR .
These data further define TCR signal transduction as involving cooperative interactions between signals by calcineurin and p21 '' '' controlled signaling pathways .
Materials and Methods Reagents Tonomycin ( calcium salt ) and phorbol-12 , 13-di-butyrate were from Calbiochem Corp. ( UK ) .
UCHT1 ( reactive for human CD3 ) was used at 10 pg/ml in culture ( 27 ) .
[ `` CJ-Acetyl coenzyme A ( at 50-60 mCi/mmol ) was from Amersham International ( Buckinghamshire , UK ) .
Cells and Transfections .
- The human T leukemia , Jurkat , and the murine cells EL4 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS .
Growth was at 37°C and humidified in 5 % CO2/95 % air .
Cells were transfected via elec-troporation ( Gene Pulser ; Bio-Rad Laboratories , UK ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Briefly , Jurkat cells were pulsed ( 2 x 10'/ml ) in media + serum , at 960 pF and 310 V. EL4 cells ( supplemented with 10 uM B @ -me for growth ) , at 10°/ml , were pulsed at 250 V and 960 uF .
Cultures were transfected and immediately stimulated , as necessary , for 24 h. Plasmids .
IL-2 chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) ( 11 ) , and NFAT CAT ( 5 ) have been previously described .
IL-2 CAT contains regulatory sequences upstream of the IL-2 gene ( from -326 to +47 ) , that include the IL-2 minimal promoter and enhancer , directing transcription of the reporter gene .
NFAT CAT contains three copies of the sequence 5° GGAGGAAAAACTGTTT CATACAGAAGGCGT 3 ' ( corresponding to the sequence from position -284 to -258 relative to the start of transcription of the IL-2 gene ) upstream of the IL-2 minimal promoter driving the reporter gene CAT .
This sequence has been identified as the binding site for NFAT , the ARRE-2 site of the human IL-2 enhancer ( 3 ) .
IL-2 mpCAT is a deletion mutant of NFAT CAT in which the binding sites for NFAT have been deleted , leaving the IL-2 minimal promoter to drive CAT activity .
The sequence of the IL-2 minimal promoter was confirmed by ds sequencing ( Sequenase , version 2.0 ; United States Biochem .
Corp. , Cleveland , OH ) .
The construct used for the expression of activated Ras was created by inserting the 0.7-kb BamHI fragment of CM Vras ( 21 ) into the BamHI site of pEF BOS ( 28 ) .
Orientation was determined by restriction analysis and activity was assessed in a focus forming assay .
CNA and CNB have been described ( 22 ) , and are expressed under the control of the SRa promoter of HTLV-1 ( 23 ) .
CNM is a truncation of in which a stop codon has been introduced at 22397 , resulting in a constitutively active , Ca**-independent phosphatase ( 29 ) .
CAT Assays .
- Assays were performed according to the method of Sleigh et al .
( 30 ) , with modifications .
Briefly , cells were lysed in 100 ul of 0.65 % NP-40 , 10 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , 1 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , for 10 min on ice .
Cellular debris was pelleted , and the lysate heat was treated at 68°C for 10 min before use .
Assay conditions were 150 mMTris , pH 8.0 , 0.05 uCi [ `` '' CJacetyl coenzyme A , and 2 mM chloramphenicol .
Chloramphenicols were extracted with ethyl acetate , and the amount of radioactivity in the acetylated products and nonacetylated substrate of each reaction was determined by liquid scintillation counting of organic and aqueous phases , respectively .
Results A Constitutively Active Mutant of Calcineurin Synergizes with Phorbol Esters to Regulate NFAT .
- 'To monitor NFAT activity , we employed transient transfection and quantitation of the expression of a CAT reporter gene whose activity is regulated by a trimer of the NFAT binding site , located upstream of the IL-2 minimal promoter .
The signaling requirements for expression of this transfected NFAT reporter gene in Jurkat cells have been described ( 3 , 6 , 13 ) .
Ionomycin , which elevates intracellular calcium , and Pdbu , which activates PKC , synergize for maximal NFAT induction ( Fig .
1 a ) .
To examine the effect of calcineurin on NFAT , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with NFAT CAT plus one or a combination of calcineurin expression constructs : CNA 4 , the wild type catalytic subunit of calcineurin ( CNA ) ; a wild type calcineurin B subunit ( CNB ) , or the constitutively active calcineurin A mutant ( CNM ) .
The latter is a deletion mutant of the calcineurin catalytic subunit , calcineurin A4 , that lacks functional calmodulin binding and autoinhibitory do-mains , and has Ca**-independent constitutive phosphatase activity in vitro ( 29 ) .
The data show that expression of wild type CNA and CNB either alone or in combination does not induce a marked activation of NFAT CAT .
As described previously , ionomycin alone has a slight stimulatory effect that is enhanced in cells transfected with the combination of CNA and CNB ( 23 ) .
PdBu alone has no apparent stimulatory effect , but the most striking observation was the strong synergy between the CNM and Pdbu that resulted in a level of NFAT induction com 1518 Ras and Calcineurin Regulate NFAT 80 oC ( J control a “ ; A CNA U so- CNB E AC CNA+CNB L2 H CNM R CQ iono+PdBu a- 401 0 C d a 6 20 '' & th stimuli b C ctl p 4.51 M pdbu < U < £ 2 2.57 G 3 `` C .A `` d 8 0.57 ctl cnm Figure 1 .

Here , 10 ug of reporter construct was used in concert with 10 ug of each calcineurin construct .

v-Ha-ras Synergizes with Calcium Ionophore to Regulate NFAT CAT in Jurkat Cells .
- p21 ' '' * '' is mutated at codon 12 and 59 ( 31 ) .
These mutations render the Ras proteins insensitive to the Ras-GTPase activating proteins such that the Ras accumulates in cells in an `` active '' GTP-bound state ( 32 ) .
When expressed in the murine thymoma EL4 , signals generated by p21 '' '' *** synergized with either the calcium ionophore ionomycin or the PKC activator Pdbu to induce NFAT ( 21 ) .
The Jurkat cells used in the present study differ from EL4 cells in their activation response to Pdbu ( 33 ) .
Hence in EL4 cells , PKC activation alone is sufficient for NFAT activity , whereas in Jurkat cells there is an apparent obligatory requirement for calcium signals for NFAT induction ( 11 ) .
The data in Fig .

and also that Ras does not synergize with PdBu was not due to insufficient expression of Ras .
Thus , the level of p21 '' ' '' ** expressed in these experiments was alone sufficient to stimulate maximal levels of AP-1 activity , i.e. , comparable to the level of AP-1 activity induced in response to PKC stimulation with phorbol ester ( Fig .

Cakineurin and p21 '' '' Synergize to Regulate NFAT .
p21 '' '' *= and CNM can both generate signals that regulate NFAT , but these signals appear to differ .
CNM synergizes with PKC , but not calcium controlled signals to regulate NFAT , whereas p21 '' '' * has the converse ability to synergize with calcium , but not PKC-controlled pathways .
To examine the potential for p21 '' and calcineurin to synergize in NFAT induction , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with NFAT CAT and p21 '' and CNM , either alone or in combination .
Data averaged from four experiments ( Fig .
3 ) show that p21 '' '*= in combination with CNM induced a strong expression of NFAT comparable to that seen in response to either plus ionomycin or CNM plus Pdbu .
Both p21 '' and calcineurin are activated in response to triggering of the TCR ( 15 , 24 , 25 ) .
The data show that p21 '' '' * plus CNM also induced NFAT CAT to a level greater than that induced in response to TCR triggering with the CD3 antibody UCHT1 ( Fig .

The regulatory effect of p21 '' * '' ** on NFAT is not confined to Jurkat cells but also occurs in a murine T cell EL4 .
The effect of calcineurin mutants on NFAT expression in cells other than Jurkat has not been explored in previous studies .

Discussion In T lymphocytes , p21 '' is stimulated via the TCR in a mechanism involving TCR inhibition of ras GT Pase-activating proteins ( ras-GAPs ) ( 15 , 18 ) .
One important role for the TCR is to control the expression and function of transcription factors such as NFAT , that contribute to the control of IL-2 gene transcription ( 6 ) .
Expression of a mutated constitutively activated p21 '' induces a response in T cells that can synergize with a calcium signal to modulate T cell activation as judged by NFAT induction ( 21 , 34 ) .
Similarly , overexpression of two src-family kinases , p56 and p595® , appear to be able to partially replace the calcium requirement for induction of NFAT -directed transcription ( 35 , 36 ) .
The components of the calcium signaling pathway able to cooperate with p21 '' ® in T cells to regulate NFAT have not been previously determined .
However , recent studies have established that calcineurin , which is regulated by increases in cytosolic calcium , is essential for TCR signaling function ( 22 , 23 , 37 ) .
The data presented here show that expression of a truncated , constitutively active calcineurin in both a human leukemic T cell line , Jurkat , and in the murine thymoma , EL4 , can substitute for calcium signals and , in synergy with an activated p21 '' , stimulate T cells to induce NFAT -mediated transcription .
Previous studies have indicated that calcineurin can synergize with phorbol esters to induce NFAT and hence the IL-2 gene ( 22 , 23 ) .
The current study identifies p21 '' as an alternative partner for calcineurin in T cell activation .
NFAT is known to have a critical function in the regulation of the IL-2 gene ( 11 , 21 ) .
However , the exact composition of this transcriptional factor is as yet unresolved .
It is proposed that NFAT is a complex of at least two compo-nents : a T cell-specific cytosolic component that translocates to the nucleus in response to increases in cytosolic calcium , and a nuclear component , expressed only in activated cells , Ras and Calcineurin Regulate NFAT that appears to be a member of the AP-1 family of transcriptional factors ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 ) .
p21 '' is well established as an in-ducer and regulator of AP-1 in fibroblasts ( 38 ) .
The present data confirm that p21 '' is also able to induce AP-1-medi-ated transcription in T cells , whereas calcineurin has no apparent regulatory effect .
It is most probable , therefore , that in the cooperation between p21 '' * and calcineurin , Ras would contribute to NFAT induction via control of AP-1 proteins , while calcineurin would regulate NFAT by control of the subcellular localization of the calcium-responsive NFAT subunit .
This model for the cooperative interaction between calcineurin and Ras in NFAT induction warrants further ex-ploration .
One complication lies in the fact that the AP-1 proteins are a large heterogeneous family of transcriptional factors , which come together in various combinations of Fos and Jun homo- and heterodimers to form functional complexes ( 39 ) .
When T cells are activated , they express multiple Fos and Jun proteins ( 40 ) , and the identity of the particular partners present in the AP-1 complex that contribute to NFAT induction is not yet clear ( 7 , 9 , 10 ) .
The downstream effectors of both p21 '' and calcineurin are not known .
One potential Ras regulated pathway that could contribute to NFAT regulation is the MAP kinase signaling cascade ( 41 ) .
p21 '' can regulate the activity of the MAP kinase Erk2 in Jurkat cells ( 42 ) .
Substrates for Erk2 include transcriptional factors such as the AP1 member c-jun , and Elk-1 , protein that complexes with serum response factor to transactivate the c-fos promoter , whose function is controlled by phosphorylation at target sites for the MAP kinase family ( 43-45 ) .
Thus , the MAP kinases could be integral to the signaling pathways that couple the TCR and p21 '' to the cell nucleus .
The potential for cooperation between p21 '' and cal cineurin has not been observed in previous studies of Ras function in other cell types .
However , the idea that Ras controlled signaling pathways are not alone sufficient for cell activation is not novel .
For example , oncogenic transformation in fibroblasts requires a cooperative interaction between Ras and other oncogenes ( 46 ) .
The demonstration herein that Ras and calcineurin can cooperate to activate T cells raises the possibility that calcineurin could be a protooncogene .
Thus , mutations in calcineurin or mutations that perturbed the regulation of calcineurin could be oncogenic if they occurred in cells expressing oncogenic Ras .
Defects in NFAT regulation have profound functional consequences for T cells , as judged by the immunosuppressive effects of the drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 that inhibit the action of calcineurin on NFAT induction ( 33 ) .
The realization that p21 '' is an important partner with calcineurin in NFAT regulation suggests that Ras could also be an important target for immunosuppression .
Alternatively , any defects in Ras regulation would have severe immune conse-quences .
This is supported by a recent study in nonobese diabetic fice , in which mature ( CD4 CD4~8+* ) T cells were not only unable to proliferate in response to TCR cross-linking , but could not demonstrate activation of p21 '' or p42 '' ** after ligation of the TCR ( 47 ) .
Direct stimulation of PKC was able to activate p21 '' , and also to restore the cells ' ability to grow in response to TCR signaling .
This suggests that a defect must exist between the TCR and the proteins in these anergic cells , supporting the hypothesis that p21 '' may play an important role in the generation of an immune response .
However , it remains to be seen if Ras defects exist in other anergic T cell models or autoimmune diseases .
