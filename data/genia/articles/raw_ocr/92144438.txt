D. , D. S. ] , Montreal , Canada Abstract The human interferon $ ( IFN-8 ) regulatory element consists of multiple enhanson domains which are targets for transcription factors involved in inducible expression of the promoter .
To further characterize the protein-DNA interactions mediating IFN-8 induction , positive regulatory domain ( PRD ) II binding proteins were purified from phorbol ester induced Jurkat T-cells and from IFN primed , cycloheximide/polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid treated Hela $ 3 cells .
From Hela cells , two major proteins of 52 and 45 kilodaltons ( kD ) copurified with DNA binding activity , whereas from T-cells , four proteins-a major protein of 52 kD and three minor proteins of 82 , 67 , and 43-47 kD-were purified .
Also , an induction specific DNA binding protein was purified from Hela cells that interacted with the ( AAGTGA ) , tetrahexamer sequence and the PRDI domain .
This protein is immunologically distinct from IRF-1/ISGF2 .
Uninduced or Sendai virus induced Hela extracts were used to examine transcription in vitro using a series of IFN $ promoter deletions .
Deletions upstream of the PRDIl element increased transcription in the uninduced extract , indicating predominantly negative regulation of the promoter .
A 2-4-fold increase in IFN-8 promoter transcription was observed in Sendai virus induced extracts , and deletion of PRDI and PRDII elements decreased this induced level of transcription .
When purified PRDII and tetrahexamer binding proteins were added to the induced extract , a 4-fold increase in transcription was observed .
These experiments demonstrate that it is possible to modulate IFN-8 transcription in vitro but indicate that additional proteins may be required to fully activate IFN-8 transcription .

Introduction Induction of type 1 IFN® genes ( IFN-a and IFN-8 ) occurs as an early response to virus infection in hemopoietic , epithelial , and fibroblastic cells .
Activation and repression of interferon 8 expression is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level and is mediated by multiple factors interacting with overlapping regulatory promoter domains , located immediately adjacent to the structural gene ( for reviews , see Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Three positive regulatory domains and two negative regulatory domains have been defined by mutational analysis of the promoter .
The PRDt domain ( -77 to -64 ) functions as a constitutive or virus-inducible enhancer when multimer-ized , depending on the cell type ( 3 ) .
Tandem repeats of the hexamer sequence AAGTGA , a conserved sequence motif present twice in PRDI , is also a virus inducible element ( 4 ) .
The positive regulatory domain PRDII ( -66 to -55 ) is also essential for virus inducibility ; base mutations or deletions which alter the PRDIIl domain of the natural promoter cause a loss in virus inducibility ( 5 , 6 ) .
Multiple copies of this element likewise function as a virus-inducible enhancer ( 3 ) .
Recently , a third positive regulatory domain , PRDIII ( -94 to -78 ) , was shown to synergize with PRDI and PRDil domains to increase virus inducibility ( 7 ) .
Two negative regulatory domains , NRDI and NRDHI , were identified by mutational analysis and in vivo footprinting ( 6 , 8 ) , but the exact boundaries of these regions have not been determined ( see Fig .
1 for the relative location of these regions ) .
The complexity of the induction process suggested by the organization of the IFN-8 promoter is further emphasized by the fact that multiple factors interact with the PRD and PRDIL domains .
Three proteins have been characterized that interact with the PRDi domain .
IRF-1 is involved in positive virus mediated induction of IFN-8 and IFN-a gene expression ( 9-11 ) .
Recently , ISGF-2 , a protein recognizing the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes , was shown to be identical to IRF-1 ( 12 ) .
Two other PRDI binding proteins , IRF-2-a protein structurally related to IRF-1-and PRDI-BF1-an 88 kD zinc finger containing protein-have been identified as transcriptional repressors of IFN-8 expression in cotransfection experiments ( 13 , 14 ) .
The PRDII domain interacts with the transcription factor NF- « B ( 15 , 16 ) and with a 300 kD protein termed PRDII-BF 1 ( 17 ) .

induction of IFN-8 transcription and is thus the only PRDIl binding protein implicated in positive regulation of the IFN-8 promoter ( 18-22 ) .
NF- « B is a multi-subunit transcription regulatory com-plex , inducible by a variety of agents including cytokines , mitogens , phorbol esters , and the HTLV-1 Tax protein ( 16 , 20 , 23 , 24 ) .
NF- « B induction is a posttranslational event .
Latent NF- « B exists in the cytoplasm as a hetero-trimeric protein ; induction involves the dissociation of a p65-p50 heterodimer from a regulatory protein ( inhibitor of « B or IB ) and nuclear translocation of the DNA binding NF- « B complex ( 25-27 ) .
Both p50 and p65 possess intrinsic DNA binding activity , and p65 is indispensible for the interaction of NF- « B with the IxB regulatory polypeptide ( 26-28 ) .
The complexity of the interactions of NF- « B with multiple enhancer elements has been increased recently with the identification of at least four different inducible DNA-binding proteins-p50 , p55 , p75 , and p85-all of which exist as latent cytoplasmic precursors that can be activated to nuclear forms with biphasic kinetics ( 29 ) .
Furthermore , cloning of the precursor complementary DNA of the DNA binding subunit of NF- « B demonstrated that p50 is identical to the KBF-1 protein which binds to the major histocompatibility complex class 1 H2K gene and , more importantly , that KBF-1/NF- « B is a member of the rel family of oncoproteins ( 30-34 ) .
The p85 protein has also been shown to correspond to c-rel ( 33 ) .
Like NF- « B , the rel family of proteins displays nuclear-cytoplasmic patterns of subcellular localization , possibly regulated via I « B-like proteins ( 34 ) .
To further characterize the role of different proteins mediating IFN-8 induction , PRD !
and PRDII binding proteins were purified from IFN primed , cycloheximide/ poly [ 1 : C ] treated Hela S3 cells and from phorbol ester stimulated Jurkat T lymphoid cells .
These proteins were added to an in vitro transcription assay consisting of a basal Hela cell nuclear extract to examine the effect of different proteins on IFN-8 gene transcription .
Both PRDI and PRDII binding proteins were capable of stimulating accurately initiated IFN-8 transcription in vitro .
Results PRDII Binding Activity in Jurkat and HeLa Cells .
The organization of the IFN-8 promoter and the 5 end points of deletions are illustrated schematically in Fig .
1 .
Inducibility of the NF- « B-like DNA binding activity was measured in two different cell types : in Jurkat T-cells following induction with phorbol ester ( PMA ) or in HeLa S3 cells with a combination of IFN , cycloheximide , and poly [ I : C ] .
Fig .
2 demonstrates that extracts from uninduced Jurkat T-cells contain little DNA binding activity capable of recognizing the PRDII domain ( P2 probe ) or the HIV enhancer ( Fig .
2A , Lanes 1-3 and 7-9 ) , whereas following phorbol ester treatment , a 40-fold increase in DNA binding activity was detected ( Fig .
24 , Lanes 4-6 and 10-12 ) .
Competition experiments demonstrated the specificity of the PRD protein-DNA complexes found in PMA-induced Jurkat extracts ( Fig .
2B ) ; both P2 and the HIV enhancer , as well as the entire IRE sequence containing a single PRDII site , competed for complex formation ( Fig .
2B , Lanes 2 , 3 , and 6 ) , whereas a mutated HIV enhancer or heterologous sequences ( P1 and P6 ) from the IFN-8 promoter did not compete for PRDII specific binding ( Fig .
2B , Lanes 4 , 5 , and 7 ) .
HeLa S3 cells also contained DNA binding activity with similar specific-ity : in this cell type , significant DNA binding activity was detected in uninduced cell extracts and was about 5-fold inducible in cells treated with IFN/cycloheximide/ poly [ I : C ] ( Fig .
2C ) .
In transfection experiments , the difference in DNA binding inducibility observed in the two cell lines correlated with the transcriptional activity of PRDII containing plasmids ( 7 ) ; a plasmid with one copy of P2 was 40-fold inducible by PMA treatment in Jurkat cells , whereas in Hela S3 cells , the same plasmid was Cell Growth & Differentiation 325 A P2 Probe Uninduced _ PMA-Induced Fig .

Purification of Cellular Proteins Interacting with the PRDII Domain .
To determine whether biochemical differences existed in the NF- « B protein-DNA complexes induced in the two cell lines , the PRDIIL DNA binding activities were purified from PMA treated Jurkat T-cells and IFN/cycloheximide/poly [ 1 : C ] treated Hela S3 cells .
Whole cell extracts were prepared from induced cells , fractionated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 columns , and subjected to three cycles of specific DNA affinity chromatography .
The profile of Jurkat cell PRDIlL DNA binding activity eluting from the Sephacryl S $ -300 column is shown in Fig .
3A ; two peaks of activity were detected-the first eluting with the majority of total cellular protein in fractions 11-20 , and the second eluting in fractions 28-35 .

The S-300 active pool from Jurkat cells was fractionated on a heparin-Sepharose column to partially fractionate a nonspecific protein ( data not shown ) , and proteins eluting from the column at 0.6 m KCl were subjected to three cycles of DNA affinity chromatography .
PRDIL DNA binding activity eluting from the DNA affinity column at 0.4-0.5 m KCl was highly enriched after two cycles ( Fig .
3B ) .
Overall , this activity was purified ~20,000-fold after the third cycle of DNA affinity chromatography .
Similarly , the PRDIlL DNA binding activity was purified from HeLa cell extracts ( Table 1 ) ; interestingly , throughout the purification , the DNA binding activity resolved as a single protein-DNA complex in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( see Fig .

The polypeptides present in different fractions were analyzed on an 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel ( Fig .

Lane 1 , no competitor DNA ; Lane 2 , 50 ng of P2 competitor DNA .
The apparent molecular weights correspond to the mass of the protein DNA cross-linked complexes ( the mass of the P2 BrdUrd probe is 13 kD ) .
mains of the IFN-8 promoter contain two permutated copies of the hexamer motif AAGTGA , multimers of which are known to bind the IRF proteins and PRDI-BF1 ( 4 , 14 ) .
A mobility shift assay was performed with protein extracts from - uninduced and IFN/cycloheximide/ poly [ I : C ] induced HeLa S3 cells , using the radiolabeled tetrahexamer ( AAGTGA ) , oligonucleotide as probe ( Fig .
5 ) .
In uninduced extracts , two protein-DNA complexes were detected ( complexes | and II ) ( Fig .
5A , Lanes 1-3 ) ; in the induced extract , the amount of complex 1 was decreased about 5-fold , complex I !
was not detected , and a new induction specific complex ( complex IIl ) was identified ( Fig .
5A , Lanes 4-6 ) .
Interestingly , this induction specific complex was not observed in IFN primed , Sendai virus induced protein extracts using either the same probe ( data not shown ) or the IFN-8 IRE ( 35 ) ; recent experiments demonstrate that complex III is specifically induced by the combination of cycloheximide and poly [ I : C ] . ''
The specificity of the three complexes was assessed using oligonucleotides representing different IFN-8 promoter domains as competitor .
For all three complexes , a 100-fold excess of homologous TH oligonucleotide competed efficiently for complex formation ( Fig .
5B , Lanes 2 and 9 ) , whereas the mutant trihexamer and the P2 ( PRD1 ! )
oligonucleotide were unable to compete for *J. Wagner and L. Cohen , unpublished observations .
binding activity ( Fig .
5B , Lanes 3 , 5 , 10 , and 12 ) .
The IRE sequence was able to compete more effectively than the P1 ( PRD1 ) oligonucleotide for the three complexes ( compare Fig .
5B , lanes 4 , 7 , 11 , and 14 ) , suggesting that sequences surrounding the PRDI domain in the IRE may be necessary to stabilize complex formation .
Interestingly , the P5 oligonucleotide representing the PRDIII region was able to compete for complex II !
formation better than for complex | ( Fig .
5B , Lanes 4 , 6 , 11 , and 13 ) .
The induction specific protein which generated complex III was purified from cycloheximide/poly [ I : C ] induced HeLa cell extracts following essentially the same purification scheme as described above for the PRDII/ « kB binding factors .
The $ -300 fractions containing TH binding activity were pooled and subjected to three cycles of TH specific DNA affinity chromatography .
Fig .
5C shows that the protein responsible for complex IIl formation eluted from the DNA affinity column at high salt concentration ( 0.7 and 0.8 m KCl ) .
SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the recovered fraction revealed a polypeptide of 56 kD ( Fig .
5D ) .
Because of similarities in DNA binding specificity and molecular weight of the TH protein and the IRF-1/ISGF-2 protein ( 11 , 12 ) , the TH fraction was compared to in vitro translated IRF-1 by Western immu-noblot analysis , using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against ISGF-2 ( 12 ) .
The antibody specifically recognized the in vitro translated 53 kD IRF-1 protein but did not react with DNA affinity purified TH protein ( Fig .

6A , Lanes 4 and 5 ) ; however , deletion to -67 caused a marked increase in IFN-8 specific transcripts ( Fig .
6A , Lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Further deletion into the vicinity of the TATA box ( -34 and -33 end points ) completely abrogated correctly initiated transcription ( Fig .
6A , Lanes 8 and 9 ) , demonstrating that the TATA box alone was not sufficient for IFN-8 promoter expression in vitro .
In IFN primed , Sendai virus induced extracts , transcription from the -281 template was increased relative to RBG ( Fig .
6A , Lane 10 ) , corresponding to a 2-fold increase in transcription in the induced extract compared to the uninduced extract ( compare Fig .
6A , Lanes 3 and 10 , and Fig .
6B ) .
Deletion to -134 caused a 2-fold increase in the level of transcription ( Fig .
6A , Lane 11 ) , whereas further deletion of sequences previously characterized as positive regulatory domains in vivo in the region between -85 and -67 resulted in a decrease in the induced level of transcription ( Fig .
6A , Lanes 12 and 13 ) .
No correctly initiated transcription occurred with the -34 and -33 Deletion End Point templates ( Fig .
6A , Lanes 15 and 16 ) , confirming that sequences upstream of the TATA sequence were required for basal expression of the promoter .
However , transcription of the -56 template was increased about 5-fold in the induced extract , to a level similar to that observed with the uninduced extract ( compare Fig .
6A , Lanes 7 and 14 ) .
The relative transcript levels obtained in Fig .
6A for the different IFN-8 promoter deletions is quantified in Fig .
6B .
Transcription of the -281 , -134 , and -85 promoters was increased in the induced versus uninduced extracts , and maximal inducibility ( 4-fold ) was obtained with the -134 promoter .
In contrast , a high level transcription of the -67 and -56 promoters occurred in uninduced extracts , and this level was not further increased in the induced extracts .
Four independent preparations of uninduced extract were also examined for their ability to support IFN-8 specific transcription in vitro and demonstrated that deletion of sequences from -281 to =-111 progressively increased IFN-8 transcription about 5-fold , confirming a dominant negative regulatory effect of these sequences on transcription ( data not shown ) .
The effect of PRDIH and TH binding proteins on IFN-8 transcription in vitro was examined using the -134 and -56 deletion templates in the IFN/Sendai stimulated extracts .
Addition of the fraction containing predominantly the 52 and 56 kD DNA binding proteins ( Fig .
3C ) resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of transcription from the -134 template but not from the RBG template 329 330 IFPN-s Protein-DNA Interactions M I 2 3 0 40 5 60 1708 9 IFN-B - » < a `` % Probe it ® muons .

7 , Lanes 6 and 7 ) .
The effect of both fractions was additive , resulting in a 4-fold increase in transcription of the -134 template ( Fig .
7 , Lane 8 ) .
However , addition of increasing amounts of the TH protein again reduced the transcript level ( Fig .
7 , Lane 9 ) , suggesting that the stoichiometry of this protein with other factors may be important for its functional activity .
The ratio of IFN-8 to RBG transcripts was not altered when both purified fractions were used together with the -56 template ( Fig .
7 , Lanes 10 and 11 ) , thus demonstrating the requirement for protein binding sequences between -134 and -56 of the IFN-8 promoter .
Discussion The results of the present study represent the first utilization of an in vitro transcription assay to characterize purified transcription factors interacting with the interferon 8 promoter .
Because of the complexity of interferon gene regulation ( 1-14 , 35 , 38-41 ) , in vitro dissection of the protein-DNA interactions mediating IFN-8 expression may be essential to an understanding of the induction process .
As a first step in reconstructing IFN-8 transcription in vitro , induction specific proteins binding to the PRDL and PRDII regions of the promoter were purified and examined for transcriptional activity in vitro .
Previous experiments had demonstrated that the inducible PRDII binding protein was indistinguishable from transcription factor NF- « B ( 19-22 ) .
Accordingly , we purified NF- « B-like PRDH binding proteins from HeLa $ 3 cells induced with cycloheximide/poly [ I : C ] and from phorbol ester stimulated Jurkat cells .
From HeLa cells , PRDIE binding activity was about 5-fold inducible by and purified as two polypeptides of 52 and 45 kD , probably identical to the p50 and p45 DNA binding proteins identified by Baeuerle and Baltimore ( 26 ) .
In contrast , the DNA binding activity from phorbol ester induced Jurkat cells resolved as multiple protein-DNA complexes in the mobility shift assay and copurified with polypeptides of 82 , 67 , 52 , and 43-47 kD .
The purification of these proteins is particularly relevant since recent studies have demonstrated that NF- « B corresponds to a family of four distinct DNA binding proteins of 50 , 55 , 75 , and 85 kD ( 29 , 33 ) , all of which Fig .

promoter activation .
Transcription reactions ( 50 wl ) contained 500 ng of plasmids p802 ( ~134/+1 start site ) ( Lanes 3-9 ) or 500 ng of p901 ( -56/+1 ) ( Lanes 10 and 17 ) , and 250 ng of RBG plasmid .
Nuclear extract from IFN/Sendai HeLa S3 cells ( 1.5 ug/al ) was used as a source of general transcription factors with no addition ( Lanes 3 and 10 ) or addition of NF- « B protein and TH binding protein as follows : Lanes 4 and 5 , 5 and 10 al of NF- « B , respectively ; Lanes 6 and 7 , 5 and 10 ul of TH fraction , respectively ; Lane 8 , 5 ul of NF- « 8 and 5 ul of TH ; Lanes 9 and 11 , 10 al of NF- « B and 10 gl of TH .
Read Through Transcript -all IFN-B RNA -all RBG RNA 95 are antigenically related to the rel family of oncoproteins ( 34 ) .
The exact relationship between the polypeptides isolated in this study and the recently identified members of the NF- « B/rel family remains to be established ; however , based on molecular weight , the 82 kD protein appears to be identical to the human c-rel/p85 protein identified by Molitor et al .
( 29 , 33 ) , whereas the 67 and 52 kD proteins may represent the p65 and p50 subunits of NF- « B ( 26-28 ) .
The differential inducibility of the NF- « B DNA binding proteins from HeLa and Jurkat cells , as reflected in distinct molecular weight protein species , is an intriguing observation that may have physiological relevance for the induction of interferon 8 and other NF- « B regulated genes .
Induction of NF- « B proteins may vary significantly with the cell type or the nature of the inducer and may contribute to the differential regulation of NF- « B dependent transcription ( 42 , 43 ) .
Temporal variations in the activation of members of the NF- « B/rel family could also contribute to differences in the yield of NF- « B binding proteins from the two cell types .
In this regard , the induction of NF- « B proteins by phorbol esters has been shown to result in a biphasic pattern of nuclear expression with 55 and 75 kD species appearing within minutes and 50 and 85 kD species appearing after several hours of cellular induction ( 29 ) .
Furthermore , it is possible that combinatorial associations between distinct NF- « B subunits may contribute to negative regulation as well as positive transcriptional activation via competition between factors at the level of DNA binding .
The v-rel protein has , in fact , been shown to function as an inhibitor of NF- « B dependent activation , whereas nontrans-forming mutants of v-rel fail to inhibit NF- « B mediated transcription ( 33 ) .
Human c-rel could play a similar role in regulation of interferon 8 and other NF- « B mediated genes , since the p85/c-rel protein normally appears in the nucleus several hours after induction ( 29 , 33 ) at a time coincident with the transcriptional repression of many NF- « B mediated cytokine genes ( 14 , 39 ) .
Alterna-tively , p85/c-rel could uncouple the normal activation pathway by protein-protein interactions which interfere with the formation of the p65-p50 heterodimer activation complex ( 26-28 ) or by acting as an IkB analogue ( 33 ) .
These possibilities will require further analysis .
A second DNA binding protein ( TH ) , capable of interacting with the PRD !
and PRDII domains of the IFN-8 promoter , was also purified from IFN/cycloheximide/ Cell Growth & Differentiation 331 poly [ I : C ] induced HeLa cells .
The DNA binding activity of the TH protein was not detected in uninduced cells and was activated in the absence of protein synthesis , reminiscent of the DNA binding factor PRDI-BFi ( 40 ) .
Furthermore , immunological studies demonstrate that the TH protein is not IRF-1/ISGF-2 , although the two proteins have similar binding specificity for AAGTGA-like sequences .
The identification of a new PRDI binding protein is relevant to IFN-8 transcription , since experiments from other systems suggest that IRF-1 may not be a primary transcriptional regulatory protein but rather may serve as a cofactor in transcriptional activation ( 12 , 44 ) .
An in vitro transcription assay was established to examine the transcriptional activity of the purified PRDI and PRDII DNA binding proteins .
In these studies , we were able to demonstrate that several in vivo features of IFN-8 regulation were reproduced in vitro using specific IFN-8 DNA templates .
1 .
In vitro transcription of IFN-8 templates in uninduced and IFN treated , Sendai virus induced HeLa cells resulted in correctly initiated transcription from the authentic mRNA start site as measured by S1 nuclease mapping ; furthermore , a consistent 2-4-fold stimulation of transcription from the -281 and -134 templates was observed in induced extracts compared to uninduced extracts .
2 .
Deletion of sequences between -281 and -111 resulted in higher basal levels of correctly initiated transcripts in uninduced extracts , demonstrating that sequences upstream of -111 negatively regulated transcription ( Fig .
6B and data not shown ) .
This sequence boundary is in agreement with the location of the negative regulatory domain NRDIL ( 5 , 8 ) .
3 .
Deletion of IFN-8 promoter sequences to -67 resulted in a basal level of transcription in uninduced extracts that was not increased in induced extracts .
The loss of inducibility is consistent with disruption of the positive regulatory domain PRD !
( 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 40 , 41 ) .
4 .
The sequences upstream of the TATA box were responsible for both basal and induced expression of the promoter , since removal of these sequences completely abrogated transcription in uninduced and induced extracts .
5 .
Finally , addition of purified PRD and PRDII DNA binding proteins to the transcription reaction produced a 4-fold increase in the transcript level from the -134 template , demonstrating that these proteins played a role in positive regulation of IFN-8 transcription .
Stimulation of IFN-8 transcription either in the virus induced extracts or following addition of purified proteins was relatively modest throughout these studies ; similar increases in transcript levels have also been observed in other defined in vitro transcription assays ( 45 , 46 ) .
In particular , NF- « B was previously shown to produce a 3-fold increase in transcription from the HIV enhancer , which contains two NF- « B binding sites ; the fact that the IFN-8 promoter contains a single site may also contribute to the moderate positive effect of NF- « B .
High basal levels of IFN-8 transcription in vitro indicate that important negative regulatory proteins that function to repress transcription in vivo may be lost during reconstitution of IFN-8 transcription in vitro ( 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 40 , 47 ) .
It will be of interest to identify and purify these proteins .
Taken together , these results reflect the current limitations of in vitro analysis , particularly with regard to the requirement for other general transcription factors or non-DNA binding accessory proteins .
Nevertheless , these experiments have demonstrated that is is possible to reproduce some of the regulatory features of IFN-8 transcription in an in vitro model system .
Future experiments will be aimed at defining more precisely the proteins and cofactors mediating basal and inducible levels of interferon transcription .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Induction Procedures .
All cell lines used were grown at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics .
T lymphoid Jurkat cells were grown in complete medium containing 5 % bovine serum , and HeLa S3 cells were grown in medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 25 mm Hepes ( pH 7.3 ) .
HeLa S3 cells were pretreated for 4 h with 500 IU/ ml of recombinant IFN-a ; , induced with cycloheximide ( 50 ug/ml ) and poly { [ I : C ] ( 25 ug/ml ) for 4 h , and subsequently used for preparation of whole cell extract ( 9 , 20 ) .
Jurkat T-cells were grown to a density of 10° cells/ml and induced by treatment with PMA to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml for 6-8 h before preparation of whole cell extract .
Whole Cell and Nuclear Extract Preparations .
Cells were pelleted after the induction period at 1200 rpm for 10 min , washed once with cold phosphate buffered saline , and resuspended in whole cell extract buffer ( 20 mm Hepes ( K* ) , pH 7.9 , 0.2 mm EDTA , 0.2 mm ethylene-glycol bis ( B-aminoethyl ether ) -N , N , N ' , N ' -tetraacetic acid , 0.5 mm spermidine , 0.15 mm spermine , 10 % glycerol , 10 mm sodium molybdate , and 1 mm dithiothreitol ) containing 0.5 mm PMSF and 1 ug/ml leupeptin , pepstatin , and aprotinin as protease inhibitors .
Cells were lysed by the addition of 2 m KCI to a final concentration of 0.5 m KCI , and lysates were gently mixed for 30 min at 4°C .
Cell debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm in a Ti60 rotor for 1 h at 2°C .
The supernatant was collected and diluted to 0.1 m KCl with WCE buffer ( 9 , 20 ) .
Protein concentrations for the different uninduced and induced extracts ranged between 1.5 and 2.0 mg/ ml .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Shapiro et al .
( 36 ) in nuclear dialysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors ( PMSF at 0.5 mm and pepstatin , leupeptin , and aprotinin at 1 ug/ml ) .
Aliquots were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay .
The band retardation assay was used to monitor DNA binding activities throughout purification as follows : 5 end labeled synthetic oligonucleotides ( 0.2 ng ) were incubated with crude WCE protein ( 0-15 ug ) and protein from different column fractions ( as described in individual experiments ) in the presence of 0.02-10 ug of poly [ dl : dC ] as nonspecific competitor DNA .
Unlabeled specific competitors were used at 0-50 ng as described .
Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min in WCE buffer containing 0.1 m KCl , and mixtures were then loaded on a 5 % native Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel .
After running at 100-150 V for 3 h , gels were dried and exposed to Kodak film at -70°C overnight .
The relative intensities of protein-DNA complexes were measured using the LKB Utroscan XL scanning laser densitometer ; the value obtained with 1 ug of crude extract was taken as 1 unit of activity .
332 IFN-8 Protein-DNA Interactions Protein Purification .
Whole cell extracts , prepared from 20 ml of IFN/cycloheximide/poly [ rl : rC ] induced HeLa S3 packed cell pellets and from 58 ml of PMA-induced Jurkat packed cell pellets , were applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column ( bed volumes , 100 and 200 ml ) equilibrated with WCE buffer containing 0.5 m KCl .
Flow-through fractions were collected , and proteins were precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 70 % .
After resuspension in buffer Z ( 25 mm Hepes ( K* ) , pH 7.9 , 20 % glycerol , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 0.5 mm PMSF , and 2 ug/ml each of leupeptin , aprotinin , and pepstatin ) containing 0.1 m KCl , the extracts were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephacryl 300 HR resin columns ( bed volumes , 120 and 500 mi ) , equilibrated with the same buffer ( the 500 ml bed volume column was run in the absence of glycerol to allow the use of a higher flow rate ) .
Active fractions were pooled ( 25 ml for HeLa S3 cell extracts and 80 ml for Jurkat cell extracts ) and incubated with nonspecific DNA , herring sperm DNA , and poly [ dl : dC ] ( 200 and 300 ug , respectively , for HeLa S3 extracts and 500 ug and 1.5 mg for Jurkat extracts ) .
After 10 min incubation on ice , the fractions were applied to specific oligonucleotide DNA affinity columns prepared as described by Kadonaga and Tjian ( 48 ) , using multimerized P2 sequences or multimers of the tetrahexamer ( AAGTGA ) , sequence .
Bound proteins were eluted with a stepwise KCl gradient ( 0.1-1 m ) in buffer Z. Fractions with DNA binding activity by mobility shift assay were pooled and purified by two additional cycles of DNA affinity chromatography .
Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad microas-say , during the purification steps .
Purified fractions were analyzed on 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and silver stained using a Bio-Rad silver staining kit .
UV Cross-Linking .
A BrdUrd substituted P2 oligonucleotide ( 43 ) was incubated with protein from the third cycle of DNA affinity chromatography in a standard mobility shift reaction , as described above .
The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then directly exposed to UV shadowing using a Spectroline transilluminator ( 302 nm ) for 30 min .
Reactions were diluted in 2 % sample buffer and loaded directly on an 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
Construction of Plasmids Containing Mutant Genes .
5 deletion mutants were created using the Erase-a-base system ( Promega ) and starting with the plasmid pT ; T ; 18 into which the 1.8-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the human IFN-8 gene had been inserted .
Essentially , this technique consists of linearizing the plasmid with BamHI to generate a 5 overhang and Pstl to generate a 3 ' overhang , followed by digestion with exonuclease III and S1 nuclease according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The plasmid DNA was filled in with Klenow and religated .
Following preliminary screening of the size of the deletion in individual clones , the end point of each deletion matant was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis .
In Vitro Transcription Assay .
Nuclear extract from uninduced or induced HeLa S3 cells was prepared and used in an in vitro reconstituted transcription assay , as previously described ( 35 ) , with the following modifica-tions : transcription reactions ( 40-50 1 ) containing 1.5-2 ug/ul of nuclear extract were preincubated with 1 ug of for 10 min on ice ; NF- « B enriched fractions or TH enriched fractions ( 0-20 ng ) were added , and reactions were started by the addition of 500 ng of IFN B DNA template , 250 ng of rabbit B-globin DNA , and four ribonucleoside triphosphates ( 100 um ) ( Pharmacia ) .
After 1 h at 30°C , RNA was harvested by a small scale guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure ( 49 ) .
Quantifica-tion of RNA transcripts was performed by S1 mapping ( 37 ) using the 5 end labeled 922-bp Bg/ll-EcoRl IFN-8 probe .
Rabbit -globin RNA was measured using a 575-bp BamHI-Pstl RBG probe .
Autoradiographs of the exposed film were scanned on the LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer .
In Vitro Transcription and Translation of IRF-1 , .
The IRF-1 complementary DNA , obtained from Dr. T. Fujita , was excised from pHIRF1-31 plasmid and subcloned in pBluescript ( Stratagene ) .
One ug of the pBluescript/IRF-1 construct was digested with Dral and used in a 25-ul transcription reaction containing the T7 polymerase , as recommended by the manufacturer ( Stratagene ) .
After extraction , RNA was redissolved in 25 al of H , O , and 2.5 ul were used for in vitro translation using a wheat germ extract in a 25-4ul reaction as recommended by the manufacturer ( Promega ) .
Western Blot Analysis .
/n vitro translated IRF-1 and the TH fraction ( 500 ng ) eluted from the first cycle of TH DNA affinity chromatography were separated on an 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellu-lose .
The proteins were incubated with a polyclonal antibody directed against ISGF-2/IRF-1 ( a gift from Dr. R. Pine ) and then developed using a sensitive chemilumi-nescence Western blotting detection system ( Amer-sham ) .
Briefly , after incubation overnight with the primary antibody , the nitrocellulose was rinsed with phosphate buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary goat anti-rab-bit antibody ; the reaction was developed as recommended by the manufacturer .
