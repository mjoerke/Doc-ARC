We show here that Bright has multiple contextual requirements to function as a transcriptional activator .
Bright can not transactivate via out of context , concatenated binding sites .
Transactivation is maximal on integrated substrates .
Two of the three previously identified binding sites in Ep are required for full Bright transactivation .
The Bright DNA binding domain defined a new family , which includes SWIL , a component of the SWI-SNF complex shown to have high mobility group-like DNA binding characteris-tics .
Similar to one group of high mobility group box proteins , Bright distorts Ep binding site-containing DNA on binding , supporting the concept that it mediates Ep remodeling .
Transfection studies further implicate Bright in facilitating spatially separated promoter-enhancer interactions in both transient and stable assays .
Finally , we show that overexpression of Bright leads to enhanced DNase I sensitivity of the endogenous Ep matrix associating regions .
These data further suggest that Bright may contribute to increased gene expression by remodeling the immunoglobulin locus during B cell development .
Transcriptional regulation of genes during development and differentiation is tightly controlled through several mecha-nisms .
The tissue specificity conferred by the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ( Ep ) has been studied extensively both for understanding Ig regulation and as a model for enhancer function ( reviewed in Ref .

Most of the previously identified factors bind to the enhancer core , and several have been shown to have some B cell specificity in terms of expression or ability to transactivate .
However , no binding site in isolation can confer all of the tissue-specific regulation seen in vivo .
Ultimately , this is the result of cumulative interactions of various nuclear factors with both DNA and each other .
The Ep core segment alone can increase transcription in transient systems ( 6 , 7 ) .
In vivo , however , the core alone is insufficient to drive transcription or maintain tissue specificity .
Transgenic studies have demonstrated that high level tissue-specific expression is only seen when the core is present in context of the MARs ( 8 ) .
This effect requires the core , because MARs alone could not produce high level expression .
Although the MARs had previously been implicated in negative regulation of the Ig locus in non-B cells ( 4 , 9-12 ) , this was the first demonstration that the MARs were required for proper expression in B cells .
Bright ( B cell regulator of IgH transcription ) is the only B cell-specific transcription factor shown to bind to , and transactivate via , the Ep MARs ( 13 ) .
Bright was first identified as a factor responsible for increased expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene following antigen + interleukin 5 stimulation of B cells in culture ( 14 , 15 ) .
The Bright binding complex has also recently been shown to contain Btk , which is critical for the DNA binding complex ( 16 ) .
Bright binds within the MARs of the IgH enhancer to distinct ATC motifs ( P sites ) previously identified as binding sites for the Ep negative regulator , nuclear factor-u negative regulator , and the MAR-binding protein , SATB1 ( 11 , 17 ) .
We have identified nuclear factor-u negative regulator as a previously characterized , lineage-non-restricted homeoprotein , Cux/CAAT displacement protein ( 18 ) , that antagonizes Bright binding and transactivation by direct competition for P sites .
Developmentally , Bright expression is maximal in late stage B cells ( 13 , 19 ) , a pattern opposite that of Cux/CAAT displacement protein ( 18 ) .
Bright is found in the nuclear matrix and within matrix-associated PML nuclear bodies ( 13 , 20 ) , locations consistent with a putative role in chromosomal organization .
Although a number of MAR binding factors have been cloned ( e.g .
see Refs .
13 , 17 , and 21-29 , and reviewed in Ref .
30 ) , Bright was the first shown to directly affect gene transcription .
MARs and attachment to the nuclear matrix can mediate specific alterations in chromatin structure ( 31-34 ) .
Such a mechanism seemed reasonable for Bright , based on features of its DNA binding .
Highly specific binding within the minor groove is achieved by virtue of two domains ( reviewed in Ref .
21325 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 21326 35 ) , a self-association/tetramerization domain , termed REKLES for a heptapeptide conserved within this region among Bright orthologues , and a DNA binding region , termed ARID for AT-rich interaction domain .
The Bright ARID defined a new family of DNA-binding proteins , including SW1I1 , a component of the SWI-SNF complex that has been shown to remodel chromatin ( 86 ) and p270 , its apparent mammalian orthologue ( 37 ) .
Components of human SWI-SNF appear to be tightly associated with the nuclear matrix ( 38 ) , suggesting that at least a fraction of this complex could be involved in chromatin organizational properties associated with MARs ( reviewed in Ref .
39 ) .
Like SWI-SNF , all ARID proteins bind AT-rich DNA , but only members that contain both ARID and REKLES bind specifically to AT-rich MAR motifs ( 85 ) .
In this report we further characterize the mechanisms through which Bright functions and the contextual requirements for Bright transactivation .
We also show that Bright bends its DNA target on binding .
This , along with the observation that Bright overexpression induces increased DNase I hypersensitivity of the enhancer , provides a rationale for how this protein may facilitate enhanced expression of the immunoglobulin gene .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs-The derivation of AEu and AP Ep mutants was described previously ( 13 ) .
Ep and AEp were cloned in the Xbal site of the pBL-CAT2 vector .
All AP mutants were cloned in the Safl-BamHI sites of the CAT vector .
The hybrid SV4A0-MAR construct ( 40 ) was previously constructed .
The S107 promoter was isolated as a BamHI-HaellI fragment ( covering nucleotides -550 to -40 ) , blunt-ended , and cloned into the pBL-CAT2 vector .
Vectors containing elements distal of the cat gene were constructed by first subcloning Ep of the appropriate mutation into pBluescript ( Stratagene ) and cloning a KprI-Sacl fragment into the distal site of either pBL-CAT2 or pBL-CAT2 containing the S107 promoter fragment .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-Specifics of binding reactions were described previously ( 13 ) .
To assess binding to the four P sites , the following contructs were used : the AP2 Ep 5 ' MAR isolates the P1 site , the AP1 Eu 5° MAR isolates the P2 site , the AP4 Eu 3 '' MAR isolates the P3 site , and the AP3 Ep 3 ' MAR isolates the P4 site .
Briefly , these fragments were end-labeled ( 20,000 epm/fmol ) , bound to in vitro-translated Bright protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of poly d ( I-C ) , and run on a 4 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel .
Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film .
Transfections and Stable Lines-Transfections of M12.4 and J558L cells and analysis of CAT protein was done as described previously ( 13 ) .
Stable transfectant lines were made by co-transfecting the indicated CAT vector in a 3-fold excess to pBK-cytomegalovirus ( Stratagene ) .
48 h after transfection , cells were selected in G418 .
Transient transfection of these cell with the Bright sense or antisense constructs were done 3-5 weeks after the selection began .
Circular Permutation Distortion Assays-The high affinity Bright binding site ( P2 X 3 ) and the circular permutation plasmid have been described previously ( 22 , 41 ) .
The P2 site concatamer was cloned into the plasmid polylinker and confirmed by sequencing .
A second series utilized an ~500-bp fragment spanning the core octamer and 3 '' MAR P3 site of Eu .
Circular permutated fragments were generated by appropriate restriction digests .
Mobility shift assay with these fragments and in vitro-translated full-length or truncated ( amino acids 216-601 ) Bright protein were performed as described above .
The binding and functional activity of the truncated Bright polypeptide were described previously ( 22 ) .
The distortion angle was estimated by the method of Thompson and Landy ( 42 ) .
Briefly , the relative mobilities of the fastest complex ( uF ) and the slowest complex ( uM ) are determined .
This ratio is then plotted on a graph of wM/uE ( abscissa ) and distortion angle ( ordinate ) derived from A-tract standards .
DNase I Digestion of Isolated Nuclei and Hypersensitive Site Analy-sis-Nuclei were isolated and treated with DNase I as detailed previously ( 48 ) .
Nuclease digests were restricted with Bg/II and analyzed on a 1.4 % agarose gel in 1 X TAE ( 40 mM Tris acetate , 1 mM EDTA ) .
The DNA was blotted onto a Bio-Rad Zeta probe nylon membrane by a modified alkaline blotting protocol ( 48 ) .
The gel was blotted overnight in 0.4 M NaOH , 0.2 M NaCl .
The membrane was then neutralized in 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5 for 5 to 10 min , air dried , and baked at 80 °C under Contextual Requirements for the Function of Bright Vector - Cell Line Bfi50x8 1558 P2x3 1558 Px3 - MI24 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Fold transactivation Fic .

Bright does not transactivate from a concatamerized binding site .
M12.4 or J558L cells were transfected with tk-CAT vectors containing concatamers of the Eu P2 site or of the high affinity Bf150 site from the S107 promoter as indicated .
Cells were co-transfected with an expression vector containing Bright in the sense ( filled bars ) or antisense ( open bars ) orientation .
Results are expressed as -fold activation over tk-CAT alone and are the average of at least four separate experiments .
a vacuum for 1 h. Prehybridization was carried out from 2 h to overnight in 0.27 M NaCl , 15 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7.0 ) , 1.5 mm EDTA , 0.5 % BLOTTO dried milk powder , 1 % SDS , 500 ug of sonicated herring testis DNA per ml .
Hybridization was carried out overnight in the same buffer in the presence of at least 2.5 X 10 '' cpm of a radiolabeled DNA probe ( specific activity , at least 10° cpm/ug ) generated by random primer synthesis with a Decaprime DNA labeling kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) .
The DNA probe used was a 800-bp Xbal-EcoRI restriction fragment found just downstream of the Ep 3 '' MAR ( 44 ) .
Autoradiograms were calibrated with DNA standards 2.3 , 2.0 , 1.3 , 1.1 , and 0.87-kb-long by constructing a plot of log DNA size versus mobility .
The sizes of the resulting hypersensitive fragments were interpolated from the resulting linear fit .
RESULTS Bright Does Not Transactivate from a Concatamerized Binding Site-In our first description of the Bright transcription factor ( 13 ) , we demonstrated that Bright could transactivate gene expression from a plasmid containing an IgH enhancer element ( Ep ) upstream of a reporter gene .
To assess the ability of Bright to transactivate gene expression from a binding site not in context of the Eu enhancer , we used reporter constructs containing concatamers of a binding site in the S107 promoter ( Bf150 ) or the Ep P2 site in transient transfections .
Expression constructs containing Bright in either the sense or antisense orientation were co-transfected with reporter constructs driven by a thymidine kinase promoter and the additional elements as described in Fig .
1 .
Concatamers of the P2 site , which gel shift analysis demonstrated is a strong Bright binding site , could not increase CAT levels in either a B cell or plasma cell line ( Fig .
1 ) .
Similarly , a reporter construct with the S107 MAR site concatamerized to eight repeats ( Bf150 X 8 ) did not show any significant increase in transcription when Bright was co-transfected in the sense orientation .
Bright Requires Specific MAR Sequences for Transactivation Function-Despite the lack of Bright activity on a concatamerized substrate , Bright clearly activated transcription from an Ep element over the levels seen from Ep alone ( see Ref .
13 and Fig .
2 ) .
Bright binding sites were required for this activity , because an Ep that lacked the P sites ( AEp ) did not mediate Bright transactivation ( see Ref .
13 and Fig .
2 ) .
To further examine the specificity for transactivation that Eu ascribes to Bright , we tested the effects of P site deletions .
Because P2 is a well characterized Bright binding site ( 13 ) , we reasoned that it might be capable of acting alone .
Indeed , a construct that lacks P1 , P3 , and P4 ( AP1 , P3 , P4 ) was competent in mediating 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Contextual Requirements for the Function of Bright s ' MAR _ core 3° MAR Eu PI Pr ps 4 AP1 , P3 , P4 [ IE ] AP2 I | |II sevezes [ | -- -| | ] Io 2 3 4 5 6 Fold Activation Fic .

Bright requires specific Ep P sites for function .
J558L cells were transfected with tk-CAT vectors containing wild-type or mutant Ep elements upstream of the tk promoter as indicated .
Results are expressed as -fold transactivation of cells transfected with the Bright sense construct over transfections with the antisense construct .
Ep alone conferred a 10-20-fold increase in CAT over tk-CAT in the absence of Bright .
Results are the average of at least four separate transfections .
Bright transactivation ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , a construct that lacked the P2 but had all other sites intact ( AP2 ) was still functional .
The additional deletion of the P4 site ( AP2 , P4 ) abrogated Bright- mediated function .
That P4 could mediate Bright transactivation alone was verified using a P4-only construct ( AP1 , P2 , P3 ) .
Interestingly , there was a trend that the P2-only and P4-only constructs were activated to a slightly lower degree than the intact Ep , though the difference was not statistically significant .
It seems possible that Bright can act through both sites but that the activity seen in the intact Ep may be the combined effects of Bright binding to both sites .
It was unanticipated that Bright could not function through the P3 site , because Bright also binds P3 very well ( Fig .
3 ) .
This lack of function suggested that competent Bright binding sites must be within a contextual arrangement to allow them to mediate transactivation .
Bright Mediates Promoter-Enhancer Interactions-Knowing that Bright could mediate transactivation from both the enhancer and the S107 promoter ( and possibly other Ig promot-ers , as well ) , we became interested in determining whether these functions were independent or whether these elements could function in concert .
We constructed CAT vectors that partially or completely recapitulated the immunoglobulin locus promoter/enhancer arrangement .
The S107 promoter fragment contains two Bright binding sites , one of which functions as a MAR ( 15 , 45 ) .
In a construct containing the promoter alone , Bright could not transactivate in a transient assay ( Fig .
4 ) .
This is in contrast to assays where Ep is placed 5 ' of the CAT gene and Bright effectively increased gene expression .
The ability of Bright to function through the IgH enhancer is also seen when the enhancer is in the distal position .
Strikingly , when both the promoter and enhancer are present in the same construct , the effects of Bright are synergistic , increasing transcription levels more than 3-fold over that seen with Ep alone in the distal position .
This Bright-mediated transactivation requires Bright binding , because a construct with AEp in the distal position could not mediate the Bright effect ( Fig .
4 ) .
Bright Transactivates Integrated Targets by MAR Interac-tion-Because Bright binding sites have the potential to act as MARs , we also studied these vectors in stably transfected cells to determine whether Bright can mediate MAR effects that 21327 would only be detected from integrated targets .
CAT constructs were stably transfected into J558L cells and selected with neomycin for 21 days before transient transfection with Bright sense or antisense constructs .
In contrast to results from the transient transfection assay , Bright is able to transactivate from the promoter alone in the stable system ( Fig .
4 ) .
This supports a role for Bright as a MAR-binding protein , because this phenomenon is only seen when the promoter construct is integrated into the chromosome .
A further increase in S107 promoter-driven transcription is seen when Ep is present in the distal position .
As in the transient studies , this interaction is specific for Bright binding , because a construct with AEu in the distal position does not transactivate beyond what is seen with promoter alone ( Fig .
4 ) .
Bright Mediates DNA Distortion-The distance between pro-moter-associated and enhancer-associated Bright sites that appear to synergize in the constructs of Fig .
4 is about 2 kilobase pairs .
We assumed that Bright may affect DNA topology to facilitate these interactions .
We have previously shown that Bright binds DNA in the minor groove ( 13 ) .
The class of high mobility group box proteins typified by lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 and SRY bind DNA in the minor groove and bend the double helix ( 41 ) .
To determine whether Bright can also distort its DNA target on binding , we used the circular permutation assay described by Giese et al .
( 41 ) , which measures DNA bending , as well as DNA flexibility caused by changes in DNA structure such as melting of AT-rich regions .
For this assay , a series of equally sized fragments , differing only in the position of a Bright binding site , were generated .
If the DNA is distorted during binding , then fragments bound near the center will migrate through a gel at a slower rate than those bound near the ends .
In Fig .
5 , a truncated Bright protein ( amino acids 216-601 ) with full binding activity distorts the circular permutated fragments as assessed by differences in complex mobility .
The full-length Bright protein had an identical effect in this assay ( data not shown ) .
The angle of induced distortion can be determined by comparing the calculated ratio uM/uE to a plot of known A-tract standards , where uM and uF are the relative mobilities of the middle-bound ( slowest migrating ) and end-bound ( fastest migrating ) fragments , respectively ( 42 ) .
For Bright , wM is calculated to be 0.41 and uF to 0.48 giving a ratio of 0.85 .
Based on A-tract standards in 4 % polyacrylamide gels , this ratio corresponds to a distortion angle of 80-90° .
Ep , Becomes DNase I Hypersensitive following Bright Over-expression-The ability of Bright to mediate specific activation of integrated binding sites and to distort DNA suggested that it may be involved with altering chromosomal architecture and nucleosome-free regions of DNA .
DNase I hypersensitive sites coincide with nucleosome-free regions in chromatin .
To test the ability of Bright to alter the chromosomal organization of the endogenous IgH locus , we stably transfected Bright into a murine mature B cell line ( WEHI 231 ) that produces low levels of endogenous Bright protein ( 13 ) .
Following a 20-day culture in G418 , we selected a clone that expressed Bright at levels ~8-fold above that in the WEHI 231 parental lane and about twice that seen in two Ig M-secreting plasmacytomas ( MOPC 104E and HNK-1 ; data not shown ) .
Nuclease sensitivity in mock-transfected WEHI 231 nuclei was limited to a 220-bp region coinciding with the Ep core ( Fig .
6 ) .
In cells ectopically expressing Bright , hypersensitivity was greater in magnitude and encompassed a significantly larger ( ~500 bp ) area that extended through the 5° MAR , which contains the high affinity P2 binding site of Bright .
A modest ( 2-3-fold ) increase in p transcription accompanied this effect ( data not shown ) but is similar to the level of u induction caused by antigen + inter 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 21328 Eu schematic A2 5° MAR labeled Contextual Requirements for the Function of Bright 5° MAR core 3 ' MAR PL P2 octamer P3 P4 Al 5° MAR M 3° MAR A3 3 ' MAR Pome UL _ | U J _ LC poly dIdC / ' ] / ’ ] Z/f ] * * `` I| Fic .

These results indicate that the endogenous enhancer assumes a more extended chromatin configuration as a direct or indirect consequence of ectopic Bright overexpression .
DISCUSSION Herrscher et al .
( 13 ) described Bright as a B cell-specific transcription factor capable of transactivating expression from the IgH enhancer ( Ep ) .
In this report we have characterized the contextual requirements of Bright transactivation to further understand how it , and potentially other MAR binding factors , can affect transcription levels .
The data presented in this report support several mechanisms for Bright-mediated transcriptional regulation .
Using transient transfection analysis we have demonstrated that context is important for Bright transactivation .
Bright was unable to transactivate gene expression from a concatamerized binding site , suggesting that it required interaction with specific factors to function .
Furthermore , Bright only acts through the P2 and P4 sites of the Ep MARs .
This was initially surprising , because Bright binds the P3 site as strongly as P2 and suggested spatial constraints for the interactions of Bright with other factors .
This suggested that Bright might function to form tertiary structures of the enhancer DNA and interact with additional DNA-binding proteins or adaptor molecules .
In support of this , we demonstrated that Bright distorts DNA .
Studies with the T cell receptor a-chain enhancer have shown the requirement for DNA bending and distortion to remodel DNA so that transcription factors whose binding sites are spatially distant can interact ( 46 ) .
It is possible that Bright plays a similar role in the induced immunoglobulin expression of late stage B cells .
Synergy between promoter and enhancer transactivation in both the transient and stable transfections suggest an additional level of function for Bright .
Because Bright exists in a tetrameric form , and only two functional chains are required for Bright binding in a gel shift assay ( 13 ) , it is likely that one Bright molecule could bind two sites .
Indeed , these studies suggest that Bright could bring an enhancer in apposition to the promoter and directly affect transcriptional activation .

Overexpression of Bright is accompanied by enhanced and extended DNase hypersensitivity of Ep .
The strategy for indirect end labeling was described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
Hypersensitive sites , mapped by reference to a 1.6-kb Bg/II restriction fragment spanning Ep , were detected by using an upstream Xbal-EcoRI 220-bp subfragment as a hybridization probe .
Nuclei , isolated from the indicated cell lines , were digested with ( from left to right in each panel ) 0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , or 2.0 ug/ml DNase I. DNA was purified , cut with Bgill , and analyzed by Southern blotting .
Molecular size markers are indicated to the left .
Hypersensitive positions , mapped by subtracting the fragment size from the parental Bg/II fragment , are indicated on the blots and superimposed onto a vertical schematic of Ep .
This effect would be consistent with studies that have implicated the IgH enhancer MARs in long range ( Ig heavy chain variable gene segment promoter-mediated ) transcriptional ac 21329 tivation ( 8 , 44 , 47 ) .
In comparing transgenic p expression in lines generated from wild-type and MAR-deleted Ep con-structs , no V ; p-initiated transcripts were detected from the MAR-deleted locus ( 47 ) .
Using a different approach , Artandi et al .
( 48 ) demonstrated that TFE3 proteins binding in the Ig promoter and enhancer could cooperate when binding sites were placed proximal and distal of a CAT gene , presumably through interaction of two dimers .
Bright already exists as a tetramer and so would not require any additional protein-protein interactions to carry out this function .
This study also provides functional evidence for the MAR binding function of Bright .
Transient transfections with the S107 promoter fragment , which contains a MAR ( 45 ) , demonstrated that Bright was unable to transactivate from this site .
In contrast , when this construct was stably transfected , Bright was now able to affect a 4-fold increase in transcription consistent with the concept that MARs only have effects when they are integrated into the chromosome .
We previously demonstrated that Bright protein can be matrix-associated ( 13 ) .
The fact that Bright is only capable of transactivating from the S107 promoter only when it is integrated suggests that Bright can function by modifying or mediating matrix attachment .
One difference between the 8107 plasmid and the construct with Eu in the proximal position , which can mediate transactivation in a transient assay , may be the availability of other interacting co-factors .
This highlights the context-dependent activity of Bright .
Bright may interact with some factors during a transient assay and allow activation from Eu , whereas matrix attachment is required for transactivation from a substrate that may have limited DNA binding factors associated with it for Bright interaction .
In support of interactions such as this , we have recently shown that Bright associates with members of the Sp100 family , which co-localize with Bright in nuclear domains and act as co-factors in transactivation ( 20 ) .
Thus , Bright has multiple requirements for transactivation activity , but the context-dependent activity may also provide multiple mechanisms for Bright to activate gene transcription .
Ectopic overexpression of Bright revealed an altered pattern of chromatin organization within the IgH enhancer in WEHI 231 B cell nuclei .
Consistent with previous studies ( 44 , 47 , 49 ) , the pattern of untransfected WEHI 231 nuclei is restricted to the Eu core .
The assembly of this complex , as judged by in vivo dimethyl sulfate methylation patterns , has been shown to be independent of the flanking MARs ( 47 ) .
Under conditions where Bright is expressed at high levels , DNase I hypersensitivity appears to extend upstream , to include the high affinity P2 site-containing MAR , but not downstream of the core .
This third , highly extended configuration extending across the 3 ' MAR is observed in the two Ig M-secreting plasmacytomas that transcribe u at ~50-fold higher levels .
Similarly , the Igx 3 ' enhancer assumes three states of DNase I detectable accessi-bility , which correlate strictly with stage of B cell development ( 50 ) .
That the Bright overexpressing cells may have begun to transition from mature to activated is consistent with the increased Ep accessibility and the slightly increased levels of u transcription observed here and with the appearance of active Bright : MAR binding complexes both in normal B cell populations and in B cell lines observed previously ( 13 , 19 ) .
Based on its SWIl similarities , nuclear matrix residence , and MAR bending properties , it is tempting to consider a direct role for Bright in this remodeling .
However , both known classes of chromatin remodeling enzymes , SWI-SNF and the histone acetyltransferases , exist as large multicomponent , ATP-hydro-lyzing complexes ( reviewed in Ref .
36 ) .
We have no evidence for or against participation of Bright as a B cell-restricted member or recruiter of either .
However , MARs do confer local regions of 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 21330 histone acetylation ( 51 ) .
In a different target gene system , Cux has been shown to form a complex with histone deacetylase that leads to gene inactivation ( 52 ) .
Bright could mediate de-repressive chromatin remodeling indirectly through its successful competition with Cux/histone deacetylase .
In a similar logic , Bright , along with related chromatin remodeling proteins , would then be in a position to clear out regions carrying the cis-acting regulatory elements of the core , contributing to the accessibility of conventional DNA binding transactivators to promoter and enhancer elements .
Studies presented in this report suggest some novel mechanisms for the regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression .
They confirm that Bright acts in a restricted manner by binding specific sites in the IgH promoter and enhancer and by potentially interacting with other factors within the enhancer core .
It further provides some insight into the mechanism of enhancer function and more specifically , how Bright may play an important role in Ig gene expression .
Further analysis of these Bright new alternatives should yield a greater understanding of long-standing questions regarding gene regulation .
