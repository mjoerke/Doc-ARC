NF-KB is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the HIV long terminal repeat and is selectively activated following HIV infection of human macrophages .
Although little information as to what signal transduction pathways mediate NF-KB activation in monocytes-macrophages is available , our previous work indicated that classical protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoenzymes were not involved in the HIV-mediated NF-KB activation .
In this study , we have focused on atypical PKC isoenzymes .
PKC-£ belongs to this family and is known to be an important step in NF-B activation in other cell systems .
Immunoblotting experiments with U937 cells demonstrate that PKC-£ is present in these cells , and its expression can be downmodulated by antisense oligonucleotides ( A0 ) .
The HIV-mediated NF-KB activation is selectively reduced by AO to PKC-£ .
In addition , cotransfection of a negative dominant molecule of PKC-£ with NF-B-dependent reporter genes selectively inhibits the HIV- but not phorbol myristate acetate- or lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of NF-KB .
That PKC-£ is specific in regulating NF-KB is concluded from the inability of PKC-C '' '' * to interfere with the basal or phorbol myristate acetate-inducible CREB- or AP1-dependent transcriptional activity .
Lastly , we demonstrate a selective inhibition of p24 production by HIV-infected human macrophages when treated with AO to PKC-£ .
Altogether , these results suggest that atypical PKC isoenzymes , including PKC- , participate in the signal transduction pathways by which HIV infection results in the activation of NF-KB in human monocytic cells and macrophages .
Persistent human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection of monocytic cell lines and of human macrophages results in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB ( 2 , 38 , 46 , 51 , 56 ) .
Macrophages are considered to be a major reservoir of persistent HIV replication in infected individuals ( 19 , 20 ) .
However , the host cell-virus interaction that regulates viral replication in these cells remains poorly understood .
Indirect evidence suggests that virus-induced activation of NF- « B is functionally important .
The HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is regulated by NF-KB alone ( 41 ) and in collaboration with other relevant transcription factors such as SP1 ( 27 , 47 ) .
HIV provi-rus deficient in NF-kB DNA binding sites has absent or sub-optimal replication in different in vitro models ( 1 , 31 , 37 , 45 , 48 ) , and blocking nuclear translocation of NF-KB or its binding to cis-acting sequences results in decreased HIV replication ( 28 , 30 , 50 ) .
Moreover , Tat , the regulatory viral protein involved in regulating viral replication , interacts directly or indirectly with the LTR NF- « B motif ( 5 , 53 , 57 ) .
All the above data suggest that HIV infection of macrophages results in the modification of signal transduction pathways and transcription factors to create a favorable environment for its own replication ; HIV-induced activation of NF- « B may be one of the mechanisms regulating viral persistence in these host cells .
NF- « B is a heterodimeric protein complex involved in the transcriptional regulation of multiple cellular and viral genes ( reviewed in reference 3 ) .
One common feature of the Rel family of transcription factors is their anchoring in the cytosol * Corresponding author .

IxBa , a 35- to 38-kDa protein , anchors the prototype NF-kB ( p50/p65 ) by masking the nuclear localization signal of p65 ( 4 , 18 , 25 ) .
A large number of stimuli , including soluble cytokines , various second messengers activated in response to an array of cell surface receptors , and viruses , result in posttranslational modifications of IxBa « and subsequent NF-kB activation ( reviewed in references 3 and 35 ) .
However , it is still unclear how multiple and unrelated signal transduction pathways target IxBa .
Both phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IxBa following activation of different cells by different stimuli are necessary for the release of NF- « B and its subsequent nuclear translocation ( 7 , 8 ) .
In vitro , multiple kinases have been shown to phosphorylate IkxBa , including , among others , protein kinase C- « ( PKC-a ) ( 22 , 54 ) , PKA ( 22 , 54 ) , p38 ( 24 ) , PKC-L-associated kinases ( 11 ) , and Raf-1 ( 33 ) .
In addition , a variety of other second messengers that function within multiple signal transduction pathways such as p21 ' '' '' , Raf-1 , src , and PKC-dependent and -independent pathways have been shown to regulate NF- « B activation ( 9 , 15-17 , 33 , 39 ) .
human pathogenic viruses other than HIV activate NF-kB .
Examples include the Tax protein of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 and the LMP-1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus ( 29 , 32 ) .
Although these two viral proteins target it is yet unknown which signal transduction pathway ( s ) is being activated ( 26 , 55 ) .
For HIV , not only are the signal transduction pathways unknown , but in addition what viral protein ( s ) exerts this action remains to be elucidated .
Initial studies by our group demonstrated that HIV infection activates NF- « B in monocytic cells by using classical PKC ( cPKC ) -independent pathways ( 46 ) .
At least 12 PKC isoforms have been cloned .
224 FOLGUEIRA ET AL .
They include the phospholipid- , diacylglycerol- , and Ca**-de-pendent PKC or cPKC isoenzymes ( « , BI and BI , and y ) ; the novel PKC ( nPKC ) isoenzymes ( 8 , g , and m ) , which are Ca** insensitive ; and atypical PKC ( aPKC ) isoenzymes ( { ) , which are insensitive to both Ca** '' and diacylglycerol ( reviewed in reference 43 ) .
Of these PKC isoforms , PKC-£ clearly participates in the regulation of NF-kB in different cell systems , as demonstrated by the use of antisense oligonucleotides and of negative transdominant molecules that inhibit PKC-£ function ( 10 , 14 , 36 ) .
In addition , PKC-£ is associated with an kinase activity ( 36 ) .
Although the exact location of PKC-£ within identified signal transduction pathways is the subject of active study , to date this kinase has been placed downstream of p21'** ( 12 ) , phosphatidylinositol kinase ( PI-3 kinase ) ( 42 , 59 ) , phosphatidic acid ( 34 ) , and ceramide ( 40 ) .
However , the specific substrates and downstream second messengers of PKC-£ remain unknown .
To continue our investigation of the signal transduction pathways which are upregulated by HIV in monocytic cells and human macrophages to result in the activation of NF-kB and thus test the hypothesis that this virus-induced activation of NF- « B is relevant for its replication and persistence in this host cell , we have focused on the role of aPKC isoenzymes , such as PKC- , in potentially mediating this activation .
For this , we have used a model of persistent HIV infection of U937 cells previously shown to contain increased NF- « B activity as a result of posttranslational modifications of IkBa « ( 38 ) .
Our studies indicate that PKC-£ is present in monocytic cells and that its interruption by using different antisense and negative transdominant approaches results in a selective decrease in HIV-induced NF- « B activation and a decrease in HIV replication in human macrophages .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and reagents .
U937 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , Md. , grown in RPMI supplemented with antibi-otics , glutamine , and 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif. ) ; and routinely tested to be mycoplasma negative .
Phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) was purchased from Sigma Chemicals , St. Louis , Mo. , and stored in dimethyl sulfoxide at -20°C .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was purchased from GIBCO-BRL , Gaithersburg , Md. , and stored at -20°C .
Plasmids , expression vectors , and oligonucleotides .
The minimal promoter-reporter construct cona-luc and the three tandem motifs of the HIV LTR NF- « B cloned upstream of cona-luc yielding xB cona-luc , as well as the AP1-luc , CREB-luc , and CMV-luc reporter genes , have been described previously ( 38 ) .
The thymidine kinase-B-galactosidase reporter plasmid was used to normalize for transfection efficacy and was purchased from Clontech .
The cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) expression vector , peDNA3 , referred to in this study as CMV , was purchased from Invitrogen , San Diego , Calif .
The PKC-f mutant ( 6 , 10 ) is a kinase-deficient PKC- { generated by a substitution of Lys-275 for tryptophan and thus lacks a functional catalytic domain .
This gene was cloned downstream of the peDNA3 to yield CMV-PKC- ( .
The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to PKC- , sense ( ATG CCC AGC AGG ACC ) and antisense ( GGT CCT GCT GGG CAT ) , have been previously described ( 13 ) and are directed to the translation initiation codon .
The PKC-y oligonucleotides are targeted to the translation initiation codon ( 44 ) , and their sequences are ATG GCT GAC GTT TTC CCG ( sense ) and CGG GAA AAC GTC AGC CAT ( antisense ) .
After purifi-cation , oligonucleotides were dissolved in sterile HEPES ( N-2-hydroxyeth-ylpiperazine-NV'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ) -saline solution , divided into aliquots , and stored at -20°C .
For the different experiments , an aliquot was stored at 4°C to avoid cycles of freezing and thawing .
Three different batches were used in the different experiments , yielding similar results .
HIV infection and oligonucleotide treatment .
Ten million exponentially growing U937 cells were infected as previously described with the LAVggy ; strain ( 38 ) .
These cells undergo a phase of cell death at days 7 to 14 postinfection , and the surviving population is refractory to HIV-induced cell death in that a productive persistent infection is established in over 90 % of cells as detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis directed to cytoplasmic p24 ( 38 ) .
U937 cells 21 to 40 days postinfection were used in the experiments .
Monocyte-derived human macrophages were generated as previously described ( 38 ) .
Briefly , buffy coats from normal healthy donors from our blood bank were processed through Ficoll-Hypaque gradients .
After an extensive washing , 4 X 10° mononuclear cells were placed in 2 ml of RPMI with 10 % human sera for 5 days .
Thereafter , J. ViroL .
nonadherent cells were removed by extensive washing and the adherent monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) were infected with 10° cpm of SF ; ,4 , ( ob-tained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Rockville , Md . )
in 0.5 ml of RPMI-10 % FBS for 18 h. Cell-free virus was then removed by extensive washing , and cells were treated with different oligonucleotides at 1 M or left untreated and incubated in duplicate wells ( per treatment ) in 2 ml of RPMI with 10 % FBS .
Cells were passaged once weekly by removing old culture supernatant and adding RPMI-10 % FBS containing or not containing the appropriate oligonucleotide treatment .
At each passage , cell supernatant was spun at 1,000 X g and the cell-free medium was frozen at -20°C for subsequent p24 determination by using a commercial p24 assay kit ( Cellular Products , Buffalo , N.Y. ) .
Cell transfections .
Transfection of U937 cells was performed by using DEAE-dextran as previously described ( 46 ) .
Exponentially growing cells were washed in TS buffer ( 46 ) and resuspended at 6 X 10° cells in 600 pl of TS containing the different plasmids and/or oligonucleotides and DEAE-dextran ( Pharmacia , Pis-cataway , N.J. ) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 20 min at 21°C .
Cells were then washed in RPMI 1640 , and 4 x 10® were resuspended in RPMI 1640-5 % FBS at 5 X 10°/ml per well in 6-well plates ( Costar , Cambridge , Mass . ) .
One additional aliquot of 2 X 10° cells was resuspended in RPMI 1640-5 % FBS at 10°/ml per well in 24-well plates .
Stimuli including PMA ( 20 ng/m ! )
and LPS ( 1 pg/ml ) were added 36 h after transfection .
Twenty-four hours posttransfection , the 2 X 10° aliquot was harvested , washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and lysed in lysis buffer ( Clontech ) , according to the manufacturer 's recommendations to detect B-galactosidase activity .
The 4 X 10° aliquot was harvested 48 h posttransfection , washed in PBS , and then lysed in a luciferase lysis buffer according to the manufacturer 's recommendations ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) to detect luciferase activity .
In both aliquots , total protein content was measured by the Bradford technique with the Bio-Rad kit ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , Calif. ) .
Transfection results are expressed as relative light units , the ratio of luciferase to B-galactosidase units normalized to total protein .
Each set of experiments was done at least three times with different plasmids and oligonucleotide preparations .
Immunoblotting .
Forty micrograms of each cell lysate was analyzed by sodium dodecy ] sulfate-10 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-10 % PAGE ) and then transferred to Immobilon membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , Mass . )
and immunoblotted with specific antibodies .
Anti-PKC isoenzyme antibodies and corresponding peptides were purchased from GIBCO-BRL .
Antibody to the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase was a kind gift from Robert Abraham ( Mayo Clinic ) .
Immunoblotting was detected by using the ECL kit ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , III . ) .
RESULTS PKC-£ is present in U937 cells and is inhibited with specific antisense oligonucleotides .
Having previously demonstrated that persistent HIV infection of U937 cells results in the activation of NF- « B in a cPKC-independent fashion ( 46 ) , we determined whether PKC isoenzymes other than those susceptible to the PKC inhibitor GF ( 60 ) that could mediate NF-kB activation were present in these cells .
To date , only the aPKC-£ isoenzyme has been clearly identified to participate in the activation of NF-B in different cell lines ( 10 , 14 , 36 ) .
Total cell lysates of U937 cells and rat brain homogenate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies directed to different PKC isoenzymes .
Within the group of cPKC isoenzymes , only PKC-y was detected in U937 lysates ( Fig .
1 , lane 9 ) , while PKC- « , -BI and -BII , and -y were present in the rat brain homogenate ( Fig .
1 , lanes 2 , 5 , and 10 ) .
The specificities of the 80-kDa cPKC isoenzymes were determined by preincubating each antibody preparation with the specific peptide prior to immunoblotting ( Fig .
1 , lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 11 , and 12 ) .
We next examined whether nPKC isoenzymes such as PKC-8 and -g were present in this cell line .
Using specific antibodies and competing peptides , we demonstrated that the 80-kDa PKC-8 and the 90-kDa PKC-g were present in rat brain but not in U937 cells ( Fig .
1 , lanes 13 and 17 ) .
The aPKC isoenzyme , PKC-£ , with a molecular mass of 65 to 70 kDa was detected in both U937 cell lysates and rat brain homogenate ( Fig .
1 , lanes 21 and 22 ) .
The nature of the double band detected by anti-PKC-£ antibodies is unclear at this time , although it has been observed by other authors to occur in COS cells ( 61 ) and is suggested to be an effect of proteolysis .
Alter-natively , the anti-PKC-£ antibody could cross-react with another recently described member of the aPKC isoenzyme voL .

PKC isoenzymes in U937 cells .
Forty micrograms of cell lysates from U937 cells ( U ) and rat brain homogenate ( B ) were analyzed by SDS-10 % PAGE followed by immunoblotting with specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the different PKC isoenzymes .
Antibody was preincubated with a 10-fold ( wt/wt ) excess amount of peptide prior to immunoblotting ( Comp ) .

group ( PKC- ) ( 52 ) .
Thus , the HIV -induced cPKC-independent activation of NF- « B in U937 cells could be potentially mediated by PKC-£ .
Because of the lack of specific pharmacological inhibitors that target PKC-£ function , we investigated whether oligonucleotides directed to the translational initiation codon of the RNA of this isoenzyme , previously shown to inhibit its function ( 13 ) , would be useful to interfere with its function in the U937 cell line .
Sense and antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specific for the PKC-£ sequence were added at different concentrations to exponentially growing U937 cells for 36 h , after which cells were harvested , analyzed for viability , and lysed .
Viability and total cell numbers were similar to those for mock-treated cells for the different concentrations of sense and antisense oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
An equal amount of protein cell lysate from each concentration of oligonucleotide was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-PKC-£ antibodies .
One-hundred-micromolar concentrations of antisense but not sense oligonucleotides to PKC-£ inhibited the expression of this kinase ( Fig .
2 ) .
Despite the apparent lack of effect of 100 uM antisense oligonucleotide to PKC-£ on cell viability and growth of U937 , we tested whether the synthesis of cellular proteins unrelated to PKC-£ could be inhibited nonspecifically .
By immunoblotting the same cellular lysates with an anti-p85 antibody that recognizes the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase , we demonstrated that synthesis of this protein is not inhibited by antisense PKC-£ oligonucleotides ( Fig .
2 ) .
In repetitive experiments , the inhibitory dose of PKC-£ antisense oligonucleotides ranged from 75 to 100 mM .
Antisense oligonucleotides to PKC- interfere with the HIV-induced NF-KB activation in U937 cells .
Previous studies have demonstrated that persistently infected U937 cells and human macrophages contain increased NF-kB functional activity as measured by NF-kB-dependent reporter genes ( 38 , 46 ) .
To test whether such activity is mediated by PKC-£ , we developed PKC-f MEDIATES NF- « B ACTIVATION IN MONOCYTES 225 a model in which oligonucleotides could be transfected con-comitantly with reporter genes rather than being added to the transfected cell culture , thus significantly reducing the amount of oligonucleotide required and potential variability in their uptake by cells .
Mock- and HIV-infected cells were cotransfected with the minimal conalbumin promoter-luciferase reporter gene ( cona-luc ) or with the same construct containing three NF-kB tandem motifs of the HIV LTR ( 3 kB cona-luc ) and 10 pM either sense or antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-£ .
As previously reported ( 38 , 46 ) , more NF-KB activity is present in HIV-infected than in mock-infected U937 cells ( Fig .
3A , compare `` mock '' groups for the two cell lines ) .
Cotransfection of PKC- antisense oligonucleotides reduced the NF-KB activity present in HIV-infected U937 cells but not that of uninfected U937 cells .
The PKC-£ sense oligonucleotides did not interfere significantly with NF- « kB-dependent function in either cell group .
To show specificity of the PKC-£ antisense oligonucleotides in interfering with the HIV-dependent NF-kB activation , titration of the oligonucleotide concentration was performed with HIV-infected U937 cells .
These cells were cotransfected either with the cona-lue or 3 kB cona-lue reporter gene and increasing concentrations of sense or antisense oligonucleotides to PKC- { .
The NF-KB activity present in HIV-infected cells was reduced with an increasing concentration of antisense but not sense oligonucleotides , with a significant reduction detected around 1 wM ( Fig .
3B ) .
In addition , Fig .
3C shows results of three representative experiments which indicate that antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-£ repro-ducibly inhibit 60 % of the HIV-induced NF- « B activity , with some degree of inhibition , albeit moderate ( 15 % ) , being observed with the sense oligonucleotides .
The lower concentration of oligonucleotides required to inhibit NF- « B-dependent transcriptional activity in HIV-infected cells ( 10 M ) in comparison with that required to inhibit PKC-£ expression ( 100 M ) is possibly due to the introduction of oligonucleotides by transfection techniques in the former situation .
To further control for the specificity of the PKC-£ antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit HIV-mediated NF- « B activation in U937 cells , we generated oligonucleotides to target another PKC isoenzyme present in these cells , PKC-y ( Fig .
1 , lane 9 ) .
In experiments similar to those described in the legend to Fig .
3 , cotransfection of either sense or antisense oligonucleotides to PKC -y did not significantly interfere with the HIV-mediated NF-kB activation , in contrast to the inhibitory effect of the antisense oligonucleotide to PKC-£ ( Fig .
4A ) .

The same amount ( 40 pg ) of cell lysate was loaded in each lane .
The membrane was then stripped and reblotted with anti-p85 antibodies .

Antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-f inhibit the HIV-mediated NF-xB activation in U937 cells .
( A ) Uninfected ( Nl ) or HIV-infected ( HIV ) U937 cells were transfected with the 3 « B cona-luc or the control cona-lue reporter gene and mock , sense , or antisense oligonucleotides to PKC- { ( 10 wM ) .
( B ) HIV-infected U937 cells were cotransfected with the control cona-lue and the 3 xB cona-luc reporter genes with different micromolar concentrations of sense or antisense PKC- .
Experiments were performed in duplicate , and standard deviations are indicated by error bars .
( C ) Shown are results from three different experiments in which U937 HIV-infected cells were cotransfected with the 3 « B cona-luc and either mock ( 0 ) , sense ( SENSE ) , or antisense ( ANTI-SENSE ) ( 10 M ) oligonucleotides to PKC-f following the same experimental design as used for the experiments represented in panels A and B .
The mean for the three experiments is expressed as percent reduction from the baseline activity of mock-treated cells .

antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-y conveyed a functional inhibitory effect , uninfected U937 cells were cotransfected with a xB-luc reporter gene and sense or antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-y and PKC-£ and then subjected to PMA stimulation .
As shown in Fig .
4B , the antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-y but not PKC-£ partially inhibited the NF-kB activity induced by PMA .
These results obtained with antisense oligonucleotides indicate certain specificity of aPKCs such as PKC-£ in mediating HIV-dependent activation of NF-kB and of the cPKC isoform ( PKC-y ) in mediating phorbol ester-dependent NF-kB activation .
negative dominant molecules selectively interfere with HIV-induced NF-KB activity .
Overexpressed functional inactive proteins that lack the catalytic domain of an enzyme compete with the endogenous protein , thus decreasing its function , and behave as negative dominant molecules .
A mutant form of PKC-£ has been previously shown to compete with and inhibit the effects of PKC- in promoting mitogenesis and cell transformation ( 10 , 12 ) .
Therefore , to confirm that PKC-£ is selectively inhibiting the HIV -induced NF- « B activity in U937 cells and to exclude a nonspecific inhibition of other cell functions by oligonucleotide administration , we used the PKC-£ negative dominant molecule , PKC-£ '' '' * .
First , we tested whether PKC-Z '' * selectively inhibited the HIV-induced NF- « B activity and not the basal or inducible activity of other transcription factors .
Uninfected and HIV-infected U937 cells were transiently cotransfected with AP1-lue or 3 « kB-lue and PKC-L '' * .
Confirming the data obtained with the PKC-L£ antisense oligonucleotides , PKC-L '' ** selectively inhibited the HIV-induced NF-kB activity but not the basal activity of an AP1-luc reporter gene ( Fig .
5A ) .
Similar results were obtained in different sets of experiments in which transfection of the expression vector did not interfere with basal activity of a CREB-luc reporter plasmid which , as with AP1 , was not found to be increased in HIV-infected cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
Because transient transfection results in protein expression of the transfected gene in a very low percentage of cells , thus limiting our ability to detect the expression of PKC-C '' '' , and to control for possible differences in expression levels of PKC-Z between uninfected and HIV-infected cells , the CMV expression vector driving the transcription of PKC-£ '' * was cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene ( CMV -luc ) and transfected in parallel with a 3 kB-luc construct into uninfected and HIV-infected U937 cells .
While increased NF-B-dependent transcriptional activity was present in HIV-infected cells , the basal activities of the CMV -luc reporter genes were similar in the two cell lines ( Fig .
5C ) .
This suggests that levels of expression of are similar in the two cell groups .
We next determined whether other stimuli that result in NF- « B activation in U937 cells , such as PMA and LPS , require PKC-£ .
U937 cells were cotransfected with the 3 « kB-luc reporter plasmid and either the CMV expression vector or PKC-T '' and then stimulated with PMA or LPS .
PMA and LPS , respectively , resulted in 3- and 12-fold increases in NF-kB activity which was not inhibited by PKC-£ '' '' '' * ( Fig .
6A ) .
Moreover , and as observed in additional experiments , PKC- [ L '' ** cotransfection was associated with increased inducibility of the 3 « B-lue reporter activity by such stimuli .
Altogether , these data suggest that PKC-£ selectively participates in a signal transduction pathway which is HIV induced and independent of those pathways used by other stimuli such as PMA or LPS .
Cotransfection of the CMV- , AP1- , or CREB-luc reporter genes and PKC- '' into U937 cells followed by PMA or LPS stimulation resulted in a three- to fourfold increase over the A 200 160 G3 - 120 3 é 80 40 0 a/f o $ ) & o/f $ yAXAZE cona-luc 3 kB cona-luc B 100 80 es Lz !

Antisense oligonucleotides to PKC-f decrease HIV replication in HIV-infected human macrophages .
Human-derived macrophages were infected with the HIV strain SF ; 4 , and treated twice weekly with either mock , sense , or antisense oligonucleotides ( 5 M ) .
Supernatants were harvested at days 14 and 21 and assayed for p24 content .
Experiments were done in duplicate wells , and the standard deviation is indicated by a line on top of each bar .
cells synergistically increased the HIV-induced NF- « B activation , and the effect was decreased by cotransfection of the mutant form of PKC-£ .
Overall , these experiments confirm that HIV infection results in the upregulation of a signal transduction pathway in which PKC-£ is one of the components and that another pathway ( s ) or other mechanisms that regulate NF-kB activation , such as those initiated by PMA , can synergize with or complement the HIV-PKC-£-dependent pathway .
PKC-£ antisense oligonucleotides reduce HIV replication in HIV-infected MDM .
Having identified a specific second messenger of a signal transduction pathway that appears to be selectively used by HIV infection in monocytic cells to upregu-late NF-kB , we tested whether inhibition of PKC-£ would lead to decreased viral replication and thus establish a correlation between NF-kB activation and persistent viral replication .
To test this hypothesis , MDM infected with a monocytotropic strain of HIV were used as a more relevant model of persistent viral replication .
HIV-infected MDM were treated with sense or antisense oligonucleotides twice weekly at the time of cell passage , and culture supernatant was then analyzed for p24 content .
As shown in Fig .
7 , HIV replication was reduced approximately 50 to 60 % by the antisense oligonucleotide to PKC- at both 14 and 21 days postinfection .
Sense oligonucleotide also interfered with viral replication , albeit to a lesser degree , suggesting a nonspecific effect of oligonucleotides on viral replication .
In addition , MDM were monitored morpho-logically with every culture passage and on day 21 analyzed for cell viability by use of a modified trypan blue analysis .
Although cell viabilities were similar among the three treatment groups ( mock , sense , and antisense ) , the decreased p24 levels correlated , in a blinded fashion , with decreased HIV -induced morphological changes ( cell enlargement and vacuolization of the apparent infected cells ; data not shown ) .
Taking into account the potential limitations of oligonucleotides in inhibiting HIV replication , these preliminary studies with MDM imply that PKC-£ is a host cell protein that participates in the regulation of viral replication in MDM .
Future studies will need to address the impact of inhibiting this PKC isoenzyme on macrophage function and whether PKC-£ selectively interferes with NF- « B activation by HIV infection and other physiological stimuli .
PKC-f MEDIATES NF- « B ACTIVATION IN MONOCYTES 229 DISCUSSION In search of cellular signal transduction pathways leading to NF-kB activation in HIV-infected cells , our studies indicate that PKC-£ , a member of the aPKC isoform family , is a second messenger involved in this virus-host cell interaction .
Interruption of PKC-£ function by using different genetic approaches in monocytic cell lines and human macrophages leads to decreased HIV-induced NF- « B activation and viral replication .
Activation of NF- « B by different viruses suggests that this type of virus-host cell interaction may be important for effective viral replication .
For HIV , NF-kB has been clearly established as a key transcription factor in modulating the HIV enhancer-promoter region ( 41 , 47 ) , regulating not only reactivation from latency but also viral persistence ( 1 , 5 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 37 , 45 , 47 , 50 , 53 , 56 ) .
Since the macrophage is a reservoir of persistent viral replication in infected individuals ( 19 , 20 ) and since we have shown that infection with monocytotropic viruses increases NF-KB activation in human macrophages ( 38 ) , we have started to dissect potential signal transduction pathways that regulate NF-B activation in infected cells .
Although little information as to what signal transduction pathways are functional in cells of the monocytic lineage is available , our previous work indicated that PKC isoenzymes regulated by phorbol esters ( i.e. , cPKC isoforms ) were functional in mediating NF-B activation in monocytic cells ( 46 ) .
However , persistent HIV infection of those cells resulted in NF-kB activation through other PKC isoenzymes and/or PKC-independent pathways .
To explore the first option , we have first focused on a PKC isoenzyme that has been classified as atypical ( differing from cPKC by the absence of the Ca**- and diacylglycerol-responsive elements ) and shown to mediate NF-kB activation in murine cells and oocytes ( 10 , 14 ) .
The mechanisms by which PKC-£ results in NF- « B activation are the subject of active study .
This transcription factor is regulated at multiple levels and by a variety of inhibitory proteins ( reviewed in references 3 and 35 ) .
One such inhibitor , IxBa ( 11 ) , is a target of phosphorylation and degradation following activation of yet-ill-defined signal transduction pathways by multiple extracellular stimuli .
Recent studies indicate that PKC-£ binds a kinase that in vitro leads to the phosphorylation of IxBa , implicating this inhibitor as a potential target of PKC- { -dependent steps resulting in NF-kB activation in vivo .
Persistent HIV replication in human monocytic cells and macrophages is associated with increased turnover of IxBa , resulting in levels constitutively decreased from those present in uninfected controls ( 38 ) .
Although studies to examine the phosphorylation characteristics of IxBa in infected cells are under way , our preliminary data indicate that IxBa is hyper-phosphorylated following HIV infection , probably rendering it more susceptible to degradation , as shown by recent studies ( 7 , 8 ) .
Therefore , it is plausible that pathways lead to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IxBa in HIV-infected cells , resulting in persistent NF-kB nuclear translocation ( 38 ) .
Further studies are required to evaluate whether PKC-£ itself or associated kinases are involved in modifying IxBa in HIV-infected cells .
Moreover , other NF-kB inhibitory molecules , such as IxBB , have been recently cloned ( 58 ) and shown to be regulated by posttranslational modifications similar to those regulating IxBa ; thus , future investigation should address whether NF-KB inhibitor molecules other than IxBa are targets of HIV and/or PKC-£ .
The fact that HIV infection , but not phorbol esters or LPS , activates NF- « xB through this kinase suggests certain specificity for the HIV-induced signal transduction pathways in monocytic cell lines and suggests that this kinase must be upstream 230 FOLGUEIRA ET AL .
of the converging common pathway that regulates NF- « B by multiple unrelated stimuli .
In addition , the function of this kinase may be cell specific .
PKC-£ has been shown to mediate NF- « B activation in mouse fibroblasts and oocytes in response to extracellular stimuli such as phospholipase C ( 10 , 14 ) , but not in T cells in response to different modes of T-cell activation ( 21 , 23 ) .
Moreover , interruption of PKC-£ in other cell systems has not been associated with disruption and other cell functions ( 10 , 14 ) .
These observations suggest that disruption of PKC- { in monocytes could potentially interfere with HIV-induced NF-kB activation and therefore possibly interfere with viral persistence without altering other physiological functions of the cell and thus target this molecule for future therapeutical intervention .
The exact location of PKC-£ within known signal transduction pathways is being studied .
Recent data point towards an association of this kinase with p21 '' ( 12 ) .
This relevant proto-oncogene is critical in mediating signal transduction signals from a variety of growth factor receptors although dispensable for some cytokine receptor-initiated signals ( 49 ) .
Although the exact relationship between these two second messengers is unknown , PKC-£ appears to be downstream of p21 '' but unrelated to the other well-characterized downstream target of ras , raf-1 kinase ( 12 ) .
PI-3 kinase has been recently shown to be another downstream second messenger of p21 '' ( 49 ) and to activate PKC-£ in vitro ( 42 , 59 ) .
Moreover , PKC-£ and ras are physically associated following cell activation ( 12 ) .
Altogether , this indicates that p21 ' '' '' may bifurcate its signalling via the raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase or the PI-3 kinase-PKC-£ pathway .
More studies are needed to define whether PKC-£ can be activated via a p21'®-independent pathway as has been suggested recently for tumor necrosis factor ( 40 ) .
How this general organization scheme of signal transduction pathways fits with the HIV-induced NF- « B activation in human macrophages is unknown .
If PKC-£ is being activated by p21 '' via PI-3 kinase , it is plausible that specific inhibitors of PI-3 kinase , such as wortmannin , should selectively interfere with the HIV-induced NF-KB activation in these cells and thus bypass our current limitation of lacking specific pharmacological inhibitors of this PKC isoenzyme .
A new PKC isoform with all the characteristics ascribed to PKC-f has been recently cloned ( 52 ) .
This new isoenzyme ( PKC-1 ) , whose function remains unknown , has an extremely high degree of homology ( up to 84 % in the catalytic domain and carboxy-terminus region ) to the better-characterized PKC-£ .
Because many of the reagents utilized to study PKC- { ( commercial antibodies , which are directed to the C terminus , and dominant negative molecules containing mutations in the catalytic domain ) may potentially cross-react with PKC- , future studies addressing the role of aPKC-£ should attempt to determine the specificity of these isoforms in the different models tested thus far .
Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the interaction between HIV and host cell proteins that favor effective viral replication and that mediate many of the HIV-induced effects on the infected cell is essential to advance our knowledge of HIV pathogenesis .
Systematic dissection of signal transduction pathways upregulated by HIV to result in the activation of transcription factors that are essential for viral replication , such as NF- « B , should identify potential targets for therapeutical intervention .
