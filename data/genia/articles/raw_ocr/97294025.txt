Introduction It has recently been demonstrated that stimulation of B cells via HLA or MHC class II antigens transduces intracellular signals mediating different biological phenomena , including homotypic cell aggregation ( 1-3 ) , inhibition of cell proliferation ( 4 ) , immunoglobulin secretion ( 5 ) , cell surface induction of the costimulatory molecule B7 ( 6 , 7 ) , and TNF-a° release by EBV+B cells JY ( 8 ) .
The local release of selected cytokines and cell-cell inter-action ( s ) are central points in B-cell development ( 9 ) , differentiation ( 10 ) , and activation ( 11 ) .
In addition , growth factors and cytokines may exert an autocrine function by binding to specific cell surface receptors .
Receptor occupancy triggers a tightly coordinated multistep signal transduction cascade to the nucleus ( 12 ) .
In this cascade , nuclear transcription factors NF- « B and AP-1 serve as terminal acceptors responsible for executing long-term responses modulating gene expression and TNF-a release ( 13 , 14 ) .
The aims of this study were to investigate the role of HLA-DR antigens in the regulation of TNF-a release by B cells at different stage of maturation and to evaluate its autocrine effects on nuclear binding activity , homotypic cell aggregation , and cell proliferation .
The experimental data we obtained demonstrate that the engagement of HLA-DR antigens by selected mAbs transduces an intracellular signal ( s ) that up-regulates the levels of TNF-a mRNA and its release by B cells Ri-1 , Ci-1 , and Sc-1 , which are at a distinct stage of differentiation ( 15 ) , and by the more differentiated B cell Raji ( 16 ) but not by the pre-B cells Nalm-6 ( 17 ) and BV173 ( 18 ) .
The intracellular signal ( s ) mediating TNF-a release is independent from those signals leading to homotypic cell aggregation and inhibition of cell proliferation .
Lastly , our data show that secreted TNF-a up-regulates NF- « B and AP-1 activity in B cells at different stage of maturation .

Time- and Dose-dependent TNF-a Release by Naim-6 and Raji Cells after the Triggering of HLA-DR Antigens .
The up-regulation of TNF-a release by Ri-l , Ci-1 , Sc-l , and Raji cells after the triggering of HLA-DR antigens by mAb L243 was found to be time and dose dependent .
In contrast , the triggering of HLA-DR antigens for different times and with different concentrations of mAb L243 did not induce TNF-a release by Nalm-6 and BV173 cells .
Figs .
3 and 4 show the time and dose dependency of TNF-a release by Raji and Nalm-6 cells , representative of three independent experiments .
A 2-3-fold increase in the amount of TNF-a detectable in the culture supernatant of Raji cells was observed after 6 h of treatment with 10 g/ml of mAb 1243 ; cytokine accumulation peaked at 24 h and decreased thereafter ( Fig .
3 ) .
The up-regulation of TNF-a release reached its maximum when mAb L243 at 10 ug/ml was used , and it was still marked when 1 ug/ml mAb was used ( Fig .
4 ) ; in contrast , the amounts of TNF-a detectable after triggering with 0.1 ug/ml of mAb L243 were similar to control values ( Fig .
4 ) .
Nalm-6 cells ( Figs .
3 and 4 ) and BV173 cells ( data not shown ) cultured under similar experimental conditions did not release detectable amounts of TNF-a .
Results similar to those obtained with Raji cells were obtained with Ri-l , Ci-l , and Sc-l cells ( data not shown ) .
The triggering of HLA-DR antigens for different times ( Fig .

Modulation of TNF-a mRNA Levels after the Triggering of HLA-DR Antigens on Nalm-6 , BV173 , and Raji Cells .
The effect of the triggering of HLA-DR antigens by mAb L243 or mAb 2.06 on TNF- « mRNA level was investigated by Northern blot analysis .
Fig .

No induction of TNF-a mRNA was observed after treatment of Nalm-6 and BV173 cells with either mAb ( Fig .
5 ) .
However , TNF-a mRNA levels increased in the three cell lines under study after 3 h of treatment with 10 ng/ml PMA ( Fig .
5 ) .
The increase in TNF-a mRNA levels of Raji cells treated with mAb L243 or PMA was time dependent .
It peaked at 3 h ( data not shown ) , decreased thereafter , and returned to baseline levels at 24 h ( Fig .
6 ) .
No change in TNF-a mRNA levels was observed when BV173 cells were treated with mAb L243 under similar experimental conditions ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , treatment of BV173 cells with PMA increased TNF-a mRNA levels with a kinetic similar to that observed for Raji cells ( Fig .

Enhancement of NF- « B and AP-1 Binding Activity after the Triggering of HLA-DR Antigens .
To investigate whether cross-linking of HLA-DR antigens would be able to regulate the transcriptional machinery and whether released TNF-a might have a role in such phenomena , we investigated NF- « B and AP-1 binding activity in the cell lines under study .
Nuclear extracts of Nalm-6 , BV173 , Ri-l , Ci-1 , Sc-l , and Raji cells , incubated with or without mAb L243 , were analyzed by EMSA .
Treatment with 10 ug/ml of mAb L243 for 1 h up-regulated NF-kB ( Fig .
7A ) and AP-1 ( Fig .
7B ) binding activity in all cell lines but not in Nalm-6 and BV173 cells .
The specificity of the up-regulation of NF- « B and AP-1 binding activity was confirmed by competition with a molar excess of unlabeled probes for NF- « B ( Fig .
7A ) and AP-1 ( Fig .
7B ) or the unrelated oligonucleotide Sp1 ( data not shown ) .
Triggering of HLA-DR antigens did not influence Spt binding activity in all cell lines under study ( Fig .
7C ) .
Polyclonal anti-TNF-a « neutralizing antibody inhibited NF- « B binding activity enhanced by mAb L243 in Raji cells but did not affect NF- « B binding activity in Nalm-6 cells ( Fig .

Similar results were obtained with Raji and Nalm-6 cells for AP-1 ( data not shown ) .
Modulation of Cell Proliferation and Homotypic Cell Aggregation after the Triggering of HLA-DR Antigens .
The effect of the triggering of HLA-DR antigens by mAb L243 or mAb 2.06 on the proliferation of Nalm-6 , Ri-1 , Ci-l , Sc-l , and Raji cells was investigated by [ °HIthymidine uptake .
Data from three independent experiments in which cells were cultured in the presence of either mAb for 24 h are reported in Table 1 .
The triggering of HLA-DR antigens did not affect [ } HJthymidine uptake by the B cells investigated to a statistically significant extent .
incorporation by Nalm-6 , Ri-1 , Ci-I , Sc-I , and Raji cells was not influenced even by prolonging their incubation with mAb L243 or mAb 2.06 for up to 72 h ( data not shown ) .
The triggering of HLA-DR antigens with 10 ug/ml mAb L243 induced homotypic aggregation of Ri-1 , Ci-1 , Sc-l , and Raji cells .
The effect was time dependent ( data not shown ) , and cell aggregates included > 50 % of cells after 1 h of culture ( Table 1 ) .
In contrast , no aggregation of Nalm-6 ( Ta-bie 1 ) and BV173 cells ( data not shown ) was observed after 1 h of culture with mAb L243 or when incubation with the mAb was prolonged up to 6 h ( data not shown ) .
The triggering of HLA-DR antigens by mAb 2.06 had no effect on homotypic aggregation of Nalm-6 , Ri-1 , Ci-1 , Sc-1 , Raji ( Table 1 ) , and BV173 cells ( data not shown ) .
The addition of polyclonal anti-TNF- « neutralizing antibody did not affect homotypic aggregation of B cells induced by mAb L243 ( data not shown ) .
Results similar to those obtained with the whole immunoglobulin molecule were observed by using F ( ab ' ) , fragments of mAb L243 under similar experimental conditions ( data not shown ) .
Discussion In addition to their classical role as antigen-presenting molecules to T cells ( 19 ) , HLA class II antigens expressed on different cell types can act as signal-transducing structures .
In fact , the triggering of HLA class II antigens on B cells activates phosphatidyl inositol turnover increasing intracellular Ca** concentration ( 20 , 21 ) and induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation ( 20 ) .
Moreover , the triggering of HLA class II antigens by staphylococcal superantigens activates tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of protein kinase C in monocytic cells ( 22 ) and activates interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 gene expression in IFN-y-treated human rheu-matoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( 23 ) .
HLA class II antigens are highly expressed throughout B-cell development ( 24 ) and differentiation ( 25 ) ; nevertheless , their functional role in discrete steps of B-cell matura- HLA-DR Antigen-mediated TNF-a Release in B Celis Fig .

TNF ' U BV173 & ‘ tion is not fully understood .
In mature B cells , the triggering of HLA-DR antigens up-regulates the constitutive release of TNF-a ( 8 ) , induces homotypic cell aggregation ( 1 , 8 ) , inhibits cell proliferation ( 4 , 5 , 8 ) , and enhances NF- « B activation ( 8 ) .
Cytokine release and cellular interactions are important events in B-cell maturation ( 9-11 ) , and to the best of our knowledge , scattered information is available on the cellular source ( s ) of released cytokines and on the mechanism ( s ) regulating nuclear factors activity in immature B cells .
Therefore , in this study , we investigated whether the triggering of selected epitopes of HLA-DR antigens expressed on B cells at a distinct stage of maturation would regulate TNF-a release and its biological role .
Cross-linking of HLA-DR antigens by mAb L243 did not induce TNF-a release by the pre-B cells Nalm-6 and BV173 , although it significantly ( P < 0.05 ) up-regulated , in a time-and dose-dependent manner , the release of TNF-a by B cells Ri-l , Ci-1 , and Sc-1 , in the intermediate stage of maturation , and by the less immature B cell Raji .
In addition , PMA stimulation induced and/or enhanced TNF-a release by all B cells investigated .
Therefore , the lack of TNF-a release that we observed with Nalm-6 and BV173 cells is likely not to reflect a constitutive inability of pre-B cells to synthesize TNF-a but rather suggests that the capacity of HLA-DR antigens to regulate TNF-a release is restricted to discrete stages of B-cell differentiation .
Consistent with this assumption is our previous demonstration that mAb L243 enhanced TNF-a release by mature EBV+B cells JY ( 8 ) and the demonstration by Northern blot analysis that TNF-a mRNA levels of pre-B cells Nalm-6 and BV173 were not affected by the triggering of HLA-DR antigens for different times , whereas they increased after their treatment with PMA with a kinetic of increase and to an extent similar to that observed for Raji cells .
Time course analysis of TNF-a mRNA on Raji cells demonstrated that the up-regulation of TNF-a release was preceded by an increase in the levels of TNF- « mRNA that peaked at 3 h and returned to baseline levels after 24 h. This rapid increase of TNF- « mRNA is similar to that observed after the triggering of HLA-DR antigens on monocytic cells THP-1 by staphylococcal superantigens TSST-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( 26 ) , and it strongly suggests a transcriptional regulation of TNF- « gene expression , which was A Nalm-6 BV173 8 o 500g , , _ & _ 50 ca $ 0 P i & o 34 iE mab L243 ; bol pl y D a I g a & L gold xB oligo - £ s .

After a 1 -h incubation at 37°C cells were washed three times with PBS and frozen at -80°C .

Nevertheless , posttranscriptional mechanisms participate in TNF-a biosynthesis ( 27 ) and their possible involvement in TNF-a release by B cells after the triggering of HLA-DR antigens by mAb L243 can not be presently ruled out .

Inhibition of NF- « B activation by anti-TNF- « neutralizing polyclonal antibody .
Cultures of Nalm-6 and Raji cells ( 1 x 10° ) were supplemented with the anti-HLA-DR mAb L243 ( 10 ug/ml ) used alone or in combination with anti-TNF- « neutralizing polyclonal antibody ( blocking activity , 1000 units of TNF-a ) .
After a 1-h incubation at 37°C , cells were washed three times with PBS and frozen at -80°C .

and BV173 cells .
This discrepancy is not due to the lack of an autocrine effect of released TNF-a on pre-B cells because TNF-a secreted by Ri-l , Ci-l , Sc-l , and Raji cells was found not to be responsible for their homotypic aggregation .
Moreover , Nalm-6 cells can be induced to aggregate by anti-CD9 and anti-very late antigen mAbs ( 28 ) ; thus , they are not intrinsically unable to aggregate but rather lack this capacity after the engagement of HLA-DR antigens .
The triggering of HLA-DR antigens did not affect the proliferation of B cells investigated .
This information is at variance with data we obtained previously with EBV +B cells JY , which are significantly growth-inhibited by the triggering of HLA-DR antigens ( 8 ) .
These data suggest that intracellular signal ( s ) regulating the release of TNF-a are distinct from those regulating cell proliferation .
Neither the release of TNF-a nor the regulation of cell proliferation or homotypic cell aggregation correlated with cell surface level of HLA-DR antigens .
In fact , staining of B cells under study with mAb L243 detected the highest expression of HLA-DR antigens on Nalm-6 cells .
The lack of effect of the anti-HLA-DR mAb 2.06 in the investigated phenomena and its reactivity with B cells under study , which was similar to that of mAb L243 , strongly suggest that selected epitopes of HLA-DR antigens transduce intracellular signals leading to the observed phenomena .
In fact , cross-inhibition experiments demonstrated that mAb L243 and mAb 2.06 recognize close but not identical epitopes of the HLA-DR molecule ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , mAb 2.06 failed to induce TNF-a release by the EBV +B cells JY ( 8 ) and did not inhibit the proliferation of JY cells ( 8 ) and of EBV+B lymphoblastoid cell line cells ( 4 ) .
To further investigate intracellular signals induced by the triggering of HLA-DR antigens on B cells at different stages of maturation , we analyzed the activation of the binding factors NF- « B and AP-1 , which are involved in the regulation of TNF-a gene expression .
NF- « B and AP-1 binding activities are activated in specific stages of B-cell maturation ( 12 , 29 ) .
Moreover , NF- « B has been reported to be a constitu-tively active nuclear protein in mature B cells , whereas in pre-B cells , it is activated only after treatment with PMA or lipopolysaccharide ( 30 ) .
The state of activation of NF- « B and the production of TNF-a by mature B cells seem to be strictly interdependent ( 30 ) ; in fact , TNF-a release by mature B cells is under transcriptional control of NF- « B ( 31 ) , and TNF-a is a potent activator of NF- « B ( 31 ) and AP-1 ( 32 ) .
Together , these observations suggested that TNF- « production by mature B cells provides a permanent NF-kB and AP-1 activation through an autostimulatory regulatory loop ( 31 ) .
Moreover , we have recently demonstrated that NF- « B activation is already detectable 15 min after the cross-linking of HLA-DR antigens on Raji cells ( 33 ) .
These observations strongly suggest the lack of an NF- « B-independent TNF-a gene expression mediated by the cross-linking of HLA-DR antigens .
The data reported in our study show that the triggering of HLA-DR antigens up-regulates NF-kB and AP-1 binding activities in B cells at intermediate and mature stages of differentiation but not in pre-B cells ( Fig .
7 ) and that secreted TNF-a is responsible for such phenomena .
Thus , the lack of NF- « B and AP-1 activation that we observed in Nalm-6 and BV173 cells is likely due to the inability of HLA-DR antigens to induce TNF-a release by pre-B cells .
Together , these data demonstrate that the triggering of HLA-DR antigens can modulate the autocrine loop involving TNF-a-regulated activation of NF- « B and AP-1 during B-cell maturation .
The involvement of an autocrine loop sustaining NF- « B and AP-1 activation in monocytoid cells has been reported .
In fact , using TSST-1 , which binds outside the antigen binding groove of HLA-DR antigens ( 34 ) , Trede et a/ .
have reported a TNF-a-dependent up-regulation of NF- « B ( 22 ) and AP-1 ( 35 ) in human monocytic cells .
It is , however , noteworthy that TSST-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B do not regulate TNF-a release and NF- « B activation by B cells ( 8 , 36 ) , suggesting a differential role of the two stimuli in the release of TNF-a by B cells .

In fact , during B cell-T cell cognate interactions , CD4 expressed on T cells induces HLA-DR cross-linking , leading to stable B cell-T cell interaction and to T-cell activation ( 37 ) , enhancing the efficiency of antigen presentation to T cells .
in addition , TNF-a is involved in the development of the germinal center ( 38 ) ; thus , it can be speculated that B-cell migration into the follicle after B cell-T cell interaction and the activation of the NF- « kB/TNF- « loop may contribute to the development of the germinal center .
Little is known about the effects of TNF- « on B-cell development ( 39 ) .
Our present data suggest that TNF-a released by immature B cells can play a significantly functional role by regulating the NF-kB and AP-1 binding activities , which are involved in the regulation of different genes relevant to B-cell development ( 31 ) .
In addition , the lack of TNF-a release by pre-B cells suggests that TNF-a might be important for B-cell development from a specific stage of maturation on .
In view of the latter considerations , it can be envisaged that HLA-DR antigens may play a critical role in B-cell differentiation by regulating the release of TNF-a in discrete stages of B-cell maturation .
The understanding of TNF-a gene expression during B-cell maturation and HLA-DR molecule-mediated signal transduction could lead to define new approaches to the control of normal and neoplastic B-cell differentiation .
Materials and Methods Cells .
The human B-cell fines Nalm-6 ( 17 ) , BV178 ( 18 ) , Ri-1 , Ci-1 , Sc-1 ( 15 ) , and Raji ( Ref .
16 ; Table 2 ) were grown in RPMI 1640 ( Flow Laboratories Inc. , McLean , VA ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS ( Flow Laboratories , Inc. ) and 2 mm u-glutamine .
All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination .
mAbs and Reagents .
The anti-HLA-DR mAb L243 and mAb 2.06 ( 8 ) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) .
mAbs were purified from ascitic fluid by sequential purification with caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate ( 8 ) .
The purity of mAb preparations was moni- tored by SDS-PAGE ( 40 ) under reducing and nonreducing conditions .
No lipopolysaccharide was detected in mAb preparations by the Limulus amoe-bocyte lysate test ( sensitivity , < 1 ng/ml ; BioWhittaker , Inc. , Walkersville , MD ) .
PMA was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO ) .
Polyclonal rabbit antihuman TNF-a neutralizing antibody was purchased from Genzyme Corporation ( Cambridge , MA } .
In all experimental procedures , 10 pl of the latter antibody were used ( able to neutralize 1000 units of TNF-a ) .
Serological and Proliferation Assays .
The double determinant im-munoassay to measure TNF- « was performed using an ELISA kit purchased from Quantikine RD ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
Indirect immunofluorescence analysis and flow cytometry were performed as described previously ( 8 ) .
For proliferation assays , Nalm-6 , Ri-t , Ci-I , Sc-I , and Raji cells were cultured ( 2 x 10° cells/well } in 96-well round-bottomed plates ( Costar Corp. , Cambridge , MA ) in 200 Ll of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS and 2 mm u-glutamine in the presence of 10 ug/ml mAb L243 or 10 ug/ml mAb 2.06 .
Control cultures were incubated under similar experimental conditions without stimuli .
All the experiments were performed in triplicate .
Cultures were incubated for due time at 37°C in a 5 % CO , humidified atmosphere and were pulsed with 1 uCi/well ( Amersham International , Ayles-bury , United Kingdom ) for 4 h. Then cultures were harvested on glass fiber strips , and incorporation was measured by a MATRIX 96 Direct Beta Counter ( Packard , Meridien , CT ) .
Cell Aggregation Assays .
Cell aggregation assays were performed as described previously ( 8 ) .
Briefly , cells ( 1 x were seeded in 8-well Lab-Tech Chamber Slides ( Nunc Inc. , Naperville , IL ) in 200 Ll of RPME 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS and 2 mm u-glutamine in the presence of 10 ug/ml mAb L243 or 10 pg/ml mAb 2.06 .
Control cultures were incubated under similar experimental conditions without stimuli .
All experiments were performed in duplicate .
Slides were scored independently by two investigators by using an inverted microscope .
RNA Extraction and Northern Blotting .
Total RNA was extracted from investigated cells ( 1 x 10 '' ) as described ( 41 ) by using the RNAfast Isolation System ( Molecular Systems , San Diego , CA } .
RNA ( 10 ug ) was size-fraction-ated on denaturing 1 % agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred overnight to Hybond-N hybridization transfer membrane ( Amersham ) .
cDNA probe for TNF-a ( kindly provided by Dr. William Jacob , Genetic Therapy , Inc. , Gaith-ersburg , MD ) was a 0.7-kb fragment cut from pT2 plasmid by the restriction enzymes Bill and Xhol .
cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [ a-*°PIJdCTP { Amersham ) using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit ( Boehringer Mann-heim , Milan , Italy ) to a specific activity of 1-3 x 10° cpm/ug .
Filters were processed for autoradiography as described ( 41 ) .
EMSA .
EMSA was performed as described previously ( 8 ) , using 5 ug of nuclear extract in the presence of 1 ug of calf thymus DNA ( Sigma ) .
Oligonucleotides containing the NF-xB , AP-1 , and Sp1 recognition sequence ( Promega , Madison , WI ; Ref .
8 ) were used as probes .
Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled at 5 '' end with [ y-*°PJATP { Amersham ) and polynucleotide kinase ( Promega ; Ref .
8 ) and used at 50 pmol per reaction .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described ( 8 ) , normalized for protein levels , and used immediately for EMSA on 7.5 % polyacrylamide gels .
Statistical Analysis .
Data were analyzed by the Student 's paired t test using the StatWorks statistical package from Cricket Software , Inc. ( Phil-adelphia , PA ) .
Differences with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
