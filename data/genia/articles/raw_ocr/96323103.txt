9 Various Modes of Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Protein-Mediated Regulation of Murine Leukemia Virus Transcription in Lymphoid Cell Lines ANDERS LADE NIELSEN , ' f PEDER LISBY NRBY , ' FINN SKOU PEDERSEN , '' AND POUL JORGENSEN'* Department of Molecular and Structural Biology and Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology , '' University of Aarhus , DK-8000 Aarhus C , Denmark Received 30 October 1995/Accepted 10 May 1996 The transcriptionally regulatory regions of the Iymphomagenic Akyv and SL3-3 murine leukemia retroviruses ( MLVs ) contain two types of E-box consensus motifs , CAGATG .
One type , Ey , is located in the upstream promoter region , and the other , E , , , . , , is located in a tandem repeat with enhancer properties .
We have examined the requirements of the individual E-boxes in MLV transcriptional regulation .
In lymphoid cell lines only , the E , , , -binding protein complexes included ALF1 or HEB and E2A basic helix-loop-helix proteins .
Ectopic ALF1 and E2A proteins required intact E. , , motifs for mediating transcriptional activation .
ALF1 transactivated transcription of Aky MLV through the two E , , , motifs equally , whereas E2A protein required the promoter-proximal E , , , motif .
In T- and B-cell lines , the E , , , motifs were of major importance for Aky MLV transcriptional activity , while the E , , ; motif had some effect .
In contrast , neither E , , , nor E , , ; motifs contributed pronouncedly to Aky MLV transcription in NIH 3T3 cells lacking DNA-binding ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins .
The Id1 protein was found to repress ALFA activity in vitro and in vivo .
Moreover , ectopic Id1 repressed E , . , -directed but not Ep , g-directed MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines .
In conclusion , E , , , motifs and interacting basic helix-loop-helix proteins are important determinants for MLV transcriptional activity in lymphocytic cell lines .
Endogenous retrovirus expression may result in induction of neoplastic diseases in mice ( 44 ) .
Within the first year of life , mice of the inbred AKR strain develop thymic lymphomas .
SL3-3 murine leukemia virus ( MLV ) , isolated from a lymphoid AKR tumor cell line , induces exclusively thymic lymphomas when injected in newborn NMRI mice , whereas the AKR endogenous MLV , Akyv , induces a broader spectrum of dis-eases , including B and T lymphomas , myelogenous leukemia , and nondifferentiated leukemia ( 35 ) .
Lymphomagenesis is linked to the activity and cell type specificity of the MLV enhancer in the U3 part of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ; e.g. , the enhancer of the T-lymphomagenic SL3-3 MLV directs greater transcriptional activity in T-cell lines than does the corresponding enhancer region of Aky MLV ( 6 , 7 , 23 ) .
The MLV U3 regions represent an amalgamation of several cis transcriptional regulatory sequences .
Recently , basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors and their cognate DNA recognition sequence , CANNTG ( E-box ) , have been characterized as putative mediators of MLV transcription regulation ( 9 , 21 , 28 , 31 , 32 ) .
The bHLH transcription factors are involved in cell growth control and transformation , sex deter-mination , pancreas gene expression , neurogenesis , muscle dif-ferentiation , and hematopoietic gene expression and differentiation ( reviewed in reference 26 ) .
The cDNA cloning of the human bHLH protein SEF-2 or E2-2 was based on its in vitro * Corresponding author .

5893 capacity to bind E-boxes in the SL3-3 MLV enhancer ( 9 ) , whereas murine ALF1 and ALF2 or E2A were cDNA cloned by affinity to the identical Akvy MLV E-boxes ( 31 ) .
Human and rat analogs to ALF1 are termed HEB/HTF4 and REB , respectively ( 17 , 20 , 46 ) .
HEB has been reported to have affinity for E-boxes in the human immunodeficiency virus , immunoglobulin enhancers , and CD4 enhancer ( 10 , 17 , 38 , 47 ) .
In transient-transfection assays , ALFI1 can frens activate transcription from Akv , SL3-3 , and the thymotropic Moloney MLV U3 regions , as well as the erythrotropic Friend spleen focus-forming virus , but not from the erythrotropic Friend MLV ( 32 ) .
Similarly , the bHLH transcription factor E47 can transactivate transcription of recombinant MLVs ( 21 ) .
Class A bHLH proteins include E12 , E47 , and E2-5 , all encoded by the E2A gene ( 13 , 27 ) ; SEF-2 or E2-2 ( 9 , 13 ) ; and ALF1 , HEB , or HTF4 ( 17 , 31 , 46 ) .
Class A bHLH proteins regulate tissue-specific gene expression and differentiation by binding to DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers with other class A bHLH or with class B bHLH proteins , such as TAL1 or SCL and myogenic factors ( 15 , 28 ) .
Class B bHLH proteins do not bind to DNA as homodimers but require heterodimer formation with class A bHLH proteins ( 28 ) .
Class A bHLH proteins can form heterodimers with helix-loop-helix proteins lacking the basic domain required for DNA binding , the Id proteins ( 4 , 8 , 37 , 43 ) .
Id proteins are dominant negative for class A bHLH protein-mediated transcriptional activation , and Id mRNA expression is inversely correlated with class A bHLH protein activity ( 4 , 36 , 45 ) .
Moreover , a family of proteins coding for zinc finger domain proteins have also been identified as repressors of bHLH activity , e.g. , ZEB and 8EF1 ( 11 , 39 ) .
Instead of mediating repression through protein-pro-tein interactions , this protein family represses class A bHLH protein activity through competition for the E-box binding site ( 11 ) .
5894 NIELSEN ET AL .
Class A bHLH proteins have been intensively studied with respect to transcriptional regulation in hematopoietic cells ( 13 , 18 , 29 , 38 ) .
Ectopic expression of the class A bHLH dominant-negative Id1 protein in transgenic mice resulted in a decrease in B-cell formation ( 41 ) .
Targeted gene disruption in mice has recently shown the importance of class A bHLH proteins in hematopoietic development ( 2 , 48 ) .
Mice with the E2A gene deleted contain no B cells , whereas other lineages , including T-cell , granulocyte , macrophage , and erythroid lineages , are relatively intact .
This may suggest an incomplete functional redundancy in gene regulation among the very homologous class A bHLH proteins ( 2 , 48 ) .
In the present study , we found that MLV E-box-binding protein complexes in lymphoid cell lines included ALF1 or HEB and ALF2 or E2A bHLH subunits and that ALF1 and E2A proteins had stringent E-box requirements for transcriptional transactivation .
Intact E-box motifs were found to have major importance for active MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines , and ectopic Id1 reduced the MLV transcriptional rate .
Our analysis showed that MLV enhancer E-boxes and corresponding bHLH transcription factors are important determinants for MLV transcription in Id-negative cells such as lymphocytes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines .
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts , HeLa epitheloid carcinoma cells , and the Mpc11 immunoglobulin-secreting B-cell line were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium-10 % newborn calf serum-2 % penicillin-streptomycin .
1691-6 and WEHI7.1 T-cell lines , the J558L immunoglobulin-secreting B-cell line , and K562 erythroleukemia cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium-10 % newborn calf serum-2 % penicillin-streptomycin .
All cells were grown with 5.6 % CO ; , at 37°C .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) vector constructions .
The pAKV6 CAT , pSL3-3CAT , and p1-99CAT constructs were described previously ( 34 ) .
To generate pE ( c ) CAT , the mutational primer 5231 ( CCCCGGTCATCTTGGGA ACCTTG ; E-box in italics and mutation underlined ) and an oligonucleotide primer in excess corresponding to the R sequence at the KpnI site were used in an asymmetric PCR with p1-99CAT as a template in a Hybaid OmniGene temperature cycler .
The single-stranded PCR product was purified and used as a primer in an additional PCR with a primer corresponding to sequences including Pstl in the upstream U3 region .
The fragment was digested with Psfl and KpnI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pAKV6CAT .
To generate pF ( ab ) CAT , a 139-nucleotide oligonucleotide with mutations in both Akvy MLV enhancer E-boxes and a tag primer nonhomologous to Aky MLV sequences for recovery of the full-length PCR products ( see reference 32 ) were used in a standard PCR with the KpnI site corresponding primer .
The PCR product was digested with KprI and partially digested with Apel , and the longest Apal-KpnI fragment ( 343 bp ) was cloned into the corresponding sites of p1-99CAT .
pE ( abe ) was generated as described previously ( 32 ) .
Vector constructs with all combinations of wild-type and mutational E-boxes were constructed by swapping the largest fragment either from Psfl to a partially digested Apel site or from KpnI to a partially digested Apel site between the constructs described above .
For generation of E-box mutation constructs with one copy of the 99-bp repeat removed , an Apal fragment was removed from pE ( c ) CAT , pE ( ab ) CAT , and pE ( abe ) CAT .
The presence of specific mutations was verified by using an Applied Biosystem Taq sequencing kit on an Applied Biosystem 373A Sequencer .
Expression vectors and protein purification .
pBNALFIA expressing ALFL under control of the EF-1 « promoter has been described elsewhere ( 32 ) .
The E12 and E2-5 expression vectors were kindly donated by R. Rivera , University of California , and T. Kadesch , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , respectively .
Expression vectors pCMV4 and pCMV4-Id1 have been described previously and were kindly donated by R. Baer , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( 16 ) .
To generate the prokaryotic expression construct coding for ALF1 amino acids 562 to 706 ( ALF1se ) 794 ) , PCR was done with the use of ALF1 primers with artificial restriction sites followed by BerHI and EcoRI cloning of the generated fragment into pGEX2TK ( Pharmacia ) .
The prokaryotic Id expression vector was generated by cloning of the full-length coding region of Id1 into pGEX2TK by use of artificial restriction sites .
Induction and purification procedures for the glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins were as described by the manufacturer ( Pharmacia ) .
The produced GST-ALF1s , , ; , , fusion protein was digested with thrombin and purified from the GST moicty .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and antibodies .
Cellular nuclear extracts were prepared as described elsewhere ( 1 ) .
Double-stranded 34-nucleotide oligonucleotide probes labeled to the same specific activities were generated as J. ViRoL .
described previously ( 32 ) .
Binding reactions of nuclear extracts with 2 x 10° cpm of probe were done at 25°C for 15 min in 25 wl of 10 mM HEPES ( N-2 hydroxyethylpiperazine-V ' -2-ethanesulfonic acid ) -NaOH ( pH 7.9 ) -10 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.9 ) -3 mM MgC1 , -80 mM NaCl-1 mM dithiothreitol-300 ug of bovine serum albumin per ml with 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) -poly ( dI-dC ) .
Prokaryotically expressed proteins were bound under the same conditions except for the addition of Tween 20 to 0.25 % in the binding buffer and preincubation of the proteins at 37°C for 30 min before the addition of DNA to assist heterodimer formations .
Following binding , the reaction products were electrophoresed through native gels ( 5 % acrylamide , 0.1 % bisacrylamide , 5 % glycerol , 50 mM Tris , 380 mM glycine , 2 mM EDTA ) and autoradiographed without drying at -80°C with intensifying screens .
In competition analysis , a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oli-gonucleotides was added together with the probe to the binding reaction mixture .
For supershift reactions , antiserum and control serum at the amounts indicated below were added to the binding reaction mixture , which was placed on ice prior to the addition of nuclear extract .
Polyclonal ALF1 antibody has been described previously ( 33 ) .
The anti-HEB antiserum ( « HEB ) was generated by immunizing rabbits with HEB amino acids 530 to 554 , a sequence region 100 % identical to the ALF ] sequence ( 38 ) .
« HEB was kindly donated by D. R. Littman , University of California .
The anti-E2A ( « E2A ) -specific antiserum was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Transfections and CAT assays .
NIH 3T3 cells ( 5 X 10° ) were transfected as described previously ( 32 ) .
Each precipitate included 2 ug of CAT reporter plasmid , 2.0 pg of expression vector , and 5 pg of pCH110 as an internal standard expressing B-galactosidase from the simian virus 40 promoter .
CAT assays were done for 0.5 to 4 h , and conversions were monitored by scintillation counting or by PhosphorImager analyses ( Molecular Dynamics ) of thin-layer chromato-grams .
Estimated values were normalized to the B-galactosidase activities to correct for variation in transfection efficiency .
Transfections of Mpc11 and K562 cells were done as for NIH 3T3 cells except that the plates were seeded with 3 X 10° cells per 100-mm-diameter plate 24 h before transfection .
DNA concentrations were 5 ug of CAT reporter plasmid , 5 ug of pCH110 , and 6 ug of cytomegalovirus 4 expression vector .
1691-6 and J558L cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran as described previously , with modifications ( 40 ) .
Briefly , 5 X 10° cells were washed and suspended in 1 ml of TSD ( 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KC , 0.6 mM Na , HPO , , 25 mM Tris base [ pH 7.4 ] , 0.5 mM MgCl , , 0.7 mM CaCl , , 0.5 mg of DEAE-dextran [ Pharmacia ] ) including 5 pg of CAT reporter plasmid and additionally , in cotransfection experiments , 5 pg of cytomegalovirus expression vector .
After incubation for 20 min at 37°C , the cells were washed twice in complete medium and incubated for 48 h. Cellular extracts were prepared and CAT activity was measured as for the NIH 3T3 cells except that the extracts were preincubated at 60°C for 10 min and centrifuged before the CAT assay .
CAT conversion was normalized to the total protein concentration , and all transfections were repeated three to nine times .
RESULTS Several distinct protein complexes interact with the MLV E-boxes .
Previous studies have shown that sequences within the U3 part of Akv and SL3-3 MLV LTRs are determinants for transcriptional activity ( 6 , 12 , 25 ) .
Recently , consensus E-box motifs ( CANNTG ) were identified in SL3-3 MLV and Akv MLV U3 regions ( 9 , 31 , 32 ) .
The U3 region of Akvy MLV contains three E-box consensus motifs ( Fig .
1 ) .
and E , , ( B ) in the tandem repeat are identical with the sequence AACAGATGGT ; the E , , , sequence overlaps the glucocorticoid response element .
Ea,4 ( C ) ( CCCAGATGAC ) is located between the tandem enhancer repeat and the promoter region .
The SL3-3 MLV U3 region contains a triplicated region carrying the E , , , E-box and an Ep , in the upstream promoter ( Fig .
1 ) .
To examine the binding of cellular proteins to the sequence regions corresponding to the E-boxes , we did electrophoretic mobility shift assays using oligonucleotide probes with the Akv MLV and SL3-3 MLV E-box sequence E , , , Or Ex , s ( Fig .
2 ) .
We have analyzed nuclear extracts from T-cell lines ( L691-6 and WEHI7.1 ) , a B-cell line ( J558L ) , and a fibroblast cell line ( NIH 3T3 ) for their ability to form complexes with affinity for the E-box sequences .
All major bands were specific for the E-box sequences , i.e. , they were not formed with oligonucleo-tides including a mutated E-box sequence such as AANNTG ( mutated nucleotide underlined ) ( data not shown ) .
When the E , , , oligonucleotide probe was used , nuclear extracts from T-and B-cell lines formed E-box-specific complexes termed nu VoL .

Structure of MLV LTR CAT gene constructs .
In the pAKV6CAT construct , the CAT reporter gene was set under transcriptional control of the Aky MLV LTR and flanking sequences .
The pSL3-3CAT construct was generated by replacing the Akvy MLV U3 region with the SL3-3 MLV U3 region .
p1-99CAT was derived from pAKV6CAT by removing one copy of the enhancer repeat .
By PCR , the mutation AAGATG was introduced into each E-box ( CA GATG ) , and all possible combinations of E-box mutations were created in the background of pAKV6CAT or p1-99CAT .
Introduced E-box mutations ( - ) and enhancer repeat structures ( shaded boxes ) are indicated .
Numbers of nucleotides are given below the boxes , with +1 corresponding to the start point of transcription .
351 « 317 +245 +173 clear factor complexes ( NFC , ,\s ) ( Fig .
2A ) .
The intensities of the bands varied for the different cell types ; NFC , ,_4 was always the most prominent band , whereas NFC , ,,2 and NF-C , , .
were barely detectable in WEHI7.1 cells .
The E-box specificity of the bands was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay competition analysis with mutant E-box probes ( data not shown ) .
E-box-specific complexes termed nuclear factor complexes ( NFC , , ; s ) were formed with the E , , , probe ( Fig .
2B and data not shown ) .
In lymphocytic cell lines , E-box-interacting protein complexes include ALF1 or HEB and ALF2 or E2A subunits .
To examine if the identified E-box-specific protein complexes formed with the oligonucleotide probes E , , , and E , , , included class A bHLH components , we did electrophoretic mobility shift assays , using polyclonal antisera raised against either ALF1 or the murine EZA protein ALF2 .
Binding of nuclear bHLH PROTEINS REGULATE MLV TRANSCRIPTION 5895 extracts from T-cell lines ( L691-6 or WEHI7.1 ) and a B-cell line ( J558L ) to the E , , , oligonuclcotide after the addition of ALF1 antiserum showed a decrease in formation of complexes ( Fig .
2A ) .
With the ALF2-E2A antiserum , we observed the same pattern but more pronounced .
In this case , NFC , , 1 was completely undetectable in the presence of antiserum .
In NIH 3T3 cells , none of the E-box complexes reacted with the antisera , in agreement with previous observations that NIH 3T3 fibroblasts are depleted of DNA-binding class A bHLH proteins ( 32 , 38 ) .
Interestingly , the two antibodies su-pershifted none of the complexes formed with the E , , , probe ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , ALF1 and ALF2 or EZA are not involved in complex formation at the E-box sequence Ex , g , localized between the enhancer and the promoter regions in both Akv and SL3-3 MLVs .
As ALFI and ALF2 or EZA are very homologous in primary structure , the polyclonal sera for ALF1 and ALF2/EZA were found to cross-react to some degree ( data not shown ) .
There-fore , we repeated our examinations with sera more specific for each component .
« HEB reacts with a domain specific for ALF1 or HEB , and « E2A reacts specifically with the ALF2 or E2A proteins ( 38 ) .
« HEB decreased the mobility of NFC , ,.1 from the T-cell lines ( Fig .
2C ) .
Nuclear extract from the B-cell line J558L includes an « HEB-retarded complex comigrating with the « HEB-retarded complexes from the T-cell lines ( Fig .
2C ) .
Hence , NFC , , includes ALF1 or HEB subunits .
Incubation with « EZA antiserum always completely removed the NFC , ,,1 ( Fig .
2D ) .
Thus , in all tested T- and B-cell lines , NFCgrel includes E2A subunits .
In conclusion , class A bHLH protein complexes of B- and T-cell lines include both ALF1 and EZA subunits that bind to the E , , , motif but not to the very homologous Ea , .
Since nuclear extracts from lymphoid cell lines contained DNA-binding ALF1 and ALF2 or E2A bHLH proteins , we did transient-transfection assays to examine the transcriptional regulatory capacity of various combinations of ALF1 and ALF2 or E2A proteins .
We cotransfected into NIH 3T3 cells the pAKV6CAT construct , having the CAT gene under transcriptional control of the Akv MLV LTR with expression vectors for the bHLH proteins .
Both ALF1 and E2A proteins activated pAKV6CAT transcription approximately fourfold ( Fig .
3 ) .
Cotransfection of ALF1 and E2A proteins showed no syn-ergistically transactivated transcription from the Akvy MLV enhancer to the same level as the putative heterodimeric complex ( Fig .
3 ) .
We should draw attention to the fact that homodimeric ALF1 or HEB and EZ2A proteins have different preferred DNA-binding sites ( 5 , 42 ) .
In addition , ALF1 and E2A proteins require different compositions of enhancer E-boxes for mediating transcriptional activity ( see below and Fig .
4 ) .
We find E-box-binding complexes without ALF1 and ALF2 or EZ2A proteins .
Similar observations have been made in other studies , i.e. , ubiquitous protein complexes lacking class A bHLH protein interact with the CD4 enhancer E-box ( 38 ) .
We do not relate these E-box-binding protein complexes , without ALF1 and ALF2 or E2A proteins , to any DNA-binding protein family , but they could make up transcription factor complexes .
Notably , the transcriptional activity mediated by protein complexes formed on the Ea , , could not be repressed by ectopic expression of Id1 ( see below and Table 2 ) .
MLV E-boxes are weak transcriptional elements in NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells .
To examine the contribution from individual E-box sequences to the MLV enhancer function , by PCR we introduced identical point mutations into each of the three Aky MLV E-boxes and created constructs with all possible combinations of wild-type and mutated E-box motifs .

ALFI and E2A proteins do not activate Aky MLV transcription synergistically .
The pAKV6CAT construct ( 2 ug ) was cotransfected into NIH 3T3 cells ( 5 X 10° ) with a total of 2 ug of expression vector , either parental empty expression vectors ( basal ) , vector expressing ALF1 ( encoding expression vectors pBNALF1A and pBNALF1B ) or E2A ( protein-encoding expression vectors E47 and E2-5 ) , or ALF ] and EZA expression vectors in combinations , as indicated .
A 2-g amount of expression vector yields half-saturation of the synthesis , as measured by either ALF1 or E2A expression .
Five micrograms of pCH110 was included as an internal standard expressing B-galactosidase from the simian virus 40 promoter .
The B-galactosidase-normalized CAT activities were estimated and visualized by setting the value of the basal expression to 100 .
The standard deviation from the mean values was =25 % .
Basal activity troduced mutation changed the E-box core sequence CAG ATG to AAGATG , a mutation found to eliminate the binding of class A bHLH proteins in vitro and transactivation in vivo ( 32 ) .
The panel of constructs generated is shown schematically in Fig .

According to the nomenclature of Speck et al .
( 40 ) , the mutated E-boxes are shown in parentheses [ e.g. , pE ( ab ) CAT includes mutations in E , , , ( A ) and E , , , ( B ) ] .
Studies of Aky MLV transcriptional regulation in NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells have shown that removal of one copy of the 99-bp enhancer repeat reduced the transcriptional activity ( 25 ) .
To examine the function of E-boxes in enhancers with only one copy of the repeat , we included such constructs in our analysis ( Fig .
1 ) .
We transfected the series of CAT gene constructs into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and evaluated CAT activities ( Table 1 ) .

70 , 1996 tions in either E , , , ( A ) or E , , , ( B ) or the double mutation resulted in no significant change in transcriptional activity .
Mutation of the promoter-proximal E-box Ea , & ( C ) did not affect the level of transcription .
Constructs with only one copy of the 99-bp repeat ( Fig .
1 ) all showed a small reduction in transcriptional activity by introduction of E-box mutations ( Table 1 ) .
In conclusion , under our assay conditions , the Akv MLV E-boxes seemed to contribute only weakly to the high Akv MLV transcriptional activity in NIH 3T3 cells .
We notice that NIH 3T3 cells lack DNA-binding bHLH proteins ALF1 and ALF2 ( Fig .
2 ) .
We repeated the analysis with HeLa cells also lacking DNA-binding class A bHLH proteins .
As observed in NIH 3T3 cells , the mutations of Aky MLV E-boxes resulted in only a reduced transcription relative to the levels of the parental construct ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , in HeLa cells , as in NIH 3T3 cells , the MLV E-boxes contributed only slightly to MLV transcription .
E-boxes contribute to Aky MLV transcriptional activity in T- and B-cell lines .
In previous studies , E-boxes were found to contribute to the transcriptional activity of lymphoid cell-ex-pressed genes , such as the immunoglobulin and CD4 genes ( 22 , 38 ) .
To examine if intact E-boxes contributed to the Akv MLV transcriptional activity in lymphoid cells relevant for MLV oncogenesis , we tested the panel of Aky MLV mutant constructs in the L691-6 and WEHI7.1 T-cell lines .
The pE ( c ) CAT construct had a twofold-lower transcriptional activity than the parental construct ( Table 1 ) .
Mutation of either E , , , ( A ) or E , , ( B ) decreased the transcriptional activity approximately fourfold , whereas the pE ( ab ) CAT construct had a 5- to 10-fold-decreased activity ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , for Aky MLV , E-boxes are essential for transcriptional activity in T-cell lines .
Removal of one copy of the repeat did not affect Akvy MLV transcriptional activity pronouncedly in L691-6 cells ( 24 ) .
Introduction of either single or double E-box mutations reduced the transcriptional activity equivalently to the decrease caused by the same mutations in the parental construct ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , in a T-cell line , the absence of one copy of the Aky MLV enhancer repeat did not enhance the importance of the remaining E-box motifs .
The greater importance of the E , , , ( A ) and E , ,_ ( B ) motifs in T-cell lines than in fibroblasts and HeLa cells correlates with the appearance of the class A bHLH complex NFC , ,.1 ( Fig .
2 ) .
We also tested the importance of Akvy MLV E-boxes for transcriptional activity in two B-cell lines .
In the B-cell lines , the pE ( c ) CAT construct had a lower transcriptional activity than the wild-type construct , as observed in T-cell lines ( Table 1 ) .
In both cell lines , the pE ( b ) CAT construct had a decreased transcriptional activity compared with that of the pE ( a ) CAT construct , indicating that the promoter-proximal E , ,_ ( B ) was more important for the enhancer function than the distal E , , , ( A ) motif .
In agreement , the E ( b ) mutation and the double mutation E ( ab ) had equivalent activities , and pE ( be ) CAT had lower activity than pE ( ac ) CAT ( Table 1 ) .
These data suggested that in B-cell lines the E , , , ( B ) motif was more important than E , , , ( A ) in control of Aky MLV transcription .
The construct with the triple mutation had a fivefold-reduced transcriptional activity compared with that of the parental construct , showing the major importance for Akv MLV E-boxes in mediating transcription in B-cell lines ( Table 1 ) .
Removal of one copy of the enhancer repeat decrease the transcriptional activity of Akvy MLV threefold in the B-cell lines ( data not shown ) .
Introduction of a mutation in E , ,\ ( B ) decreased transcriptional activity pronouncedly in the background of p1-99CAT ( Table 1 ) .
Moreover , the mutations E ( c ) and E ( be ) decreased the transcriptional activity ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , removal of one copy of the 99-bp repeat increased the importance for bHLH PROTEINS REGULATE MLV TRANSCRIPTION 5897 intact E-boxes in B-cell lines .
In conclusion , in T- and B-cell lines , E-boxes and in particular enhancer E , , , E-boxes have major importance for proper Aky MLV transcription .
In T-cell lines , E , , , ( A ) and E , ,_ ( B ) might be of equivalent importance , whereas E , , , ( B ) might be more important than E , , , ( A ) in B-cell lines .
In the K562 erythroleukemia cell line , class A bHLH proteins exist in heterodimeric complexes with the class B bHLH oncoprotein TAL1 ( 14 , 30 ) .
In K562 cells , a twofold reduction in transcription resulting from the E , , , mutations E ( a ) , E ( b ) , and E ( ab ) , as well as the Ea , , mutation E ( c ) , was observed ( Table 1 ) .
Removal of one copy of the Aky MLV enhancer repeat decreased the transcriptional activity in K562 cells twofold compared with that of the parental-type enhancer ( data not shown ) .
By further introduction of mutations in the E-boxes , we observed a decrease in activity smaller than the decrease observed for E-box mutations in the parental-type construct ( Table 1 ) .
In conclusion , in T-cell lines and an erythroleukemia cell line , E-box-binding protein complexes transactivate equivalently through both enhancer E , , , E-boxes , and in B-cell lines , protein complexes transactivate preferentially through the most promoter-proximal enhancer E-box , E , , , ( B ) .
ALF1 and E2A transactivations have different enhancer E-box constraints .
Since bHLH proteins were found to interact solely with the motifs E , ,\ ( A ) and E , ,\ ( B ) and since distinct E-boxes contribute differently to Akv MLV transcriptional activity in lymphocytes , we wanted to examine the activator capacity of class A bHLH proteins .
We cotransfected the different Aky MLV-based CAT constructs into NIH 3T3 cells with the ALF1 expression vector and evaluated CAT activities for the examination of the putative activator function of ALF1 .
As previously observed , ALF1 transactivates the wild-type pAKV6CAT construct ( Fig .
3 and 4 ) ( 32 ) .
The pE ( c ) CAT construct was transactivated by ALF1 , whereas the pE ( ab ) CAT and pE ( abe ) CAT constructs did not respond positively to ALF1 overexpression ( Fig .
4A ) .
Thus , the enhancer E-boxes are necessary for ALFI1 function , which is in accordance with the observations that enhancer-localized E , , , motifs are binding sites for ALF1 ( Fig .
2 ) ( 32 ) .
The constructs pE ( a ) CAT and pE ( b ) CAT responded identically to transactivation by ALF1 ( Fig .
4A ) .
Thus , the existence of a single enhancer E-box is sufficient for mediating a positive ALF1 transcriptional signal , similar to the observations for T-cell lines with DNA-binding ALF ] subunits .
Furthermore , we examined CAT constructs for transcriptional transactivation mediated by the £24 gene-en-coded protein , E2-5 .
Like ALF1 , E2-5 required intact E , , , motifs for mediating transcriptional activation ( Fig .
4B ) .
Interestingly , the pE ( a ) CAT construct was transactivated , while the pE ( b ) CAT construct was not significantly activated ( Fig .
4B ) .
Thus , the ALF1 and E2A proteins have different E-box constraints for mediating transcriptional activation .
The importance of the E , , , ( B ) motif in EZ2A-mediated transcriptional activation parallels the importance of the intact motif for mediating transcriptional activity in B-cell lines , a cell type in which EZA subunit-including complexes bind to the motif ( Fig .
2 ) .
In constructs in which one copy of the enhancer repeat is removed , EZA protein E2-5 and ALF1 transactivated transcription equally ( Fig .
4B ) .
The different E-box requirements for transcriptional activation mediated by EZ2A protein E2-5 and ALF1 suggest that these two very homologous proteins somehow may contact the transcriptional machinery formed on the MLV promoter-enhancer differently .

ALF1 and E2A proteins have different constraints for E-box-medi-ated transcriptional activation .
The CAT reporter constructs ( 2 pg ) depicted in Fig .
1 were cotransfected in NIH 3T3 cells ( 5 x 10° ) with empty expression vectors and vectors expressing either ALF1 ( A ) or E2-5 ( B ) .
In all cases , the total amount of expression vector was 2 ug per transfection .
Five micrograms of pCH110 was included as an internal standard expressing B-galactosidase from the simian virus 40 promoter .
CAT activities normalized for B-galactosidase activities were estimated and visualized by setting the value for reporter constructs without bHLH overexpression to 100 .
The standard deviation from the mean values was < 20 % .
1E ( b ) ing bHLH proteins in vitro , we did electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
An oligonucleotide including the E , , , motif was used as a DNA probe ( Fig .
5A , lane 1 ) .
Purified ALF1sze » _ 706 resulted in the generation of a doublet of retarded bands constituting DNA-binding ALF1 oligomers ( Fig .
5A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Addition of GST -Id1 to ALF1sg ; 794 resulted in a nearly 100 % reduction of ALF1 DNA binding ( Fig .
5A , lane 5 ) .
Thus , Id1 functions in vitro as a repressor of ALF1 DNA-binding activity , as observed for other class A bHLH proteins .
We examined the repressive effect of Id1 in vivo on MLV transcription in NIH 3T3 cells , using pAKV6CAT or pSL3-3CAT as a reporter construct .
Ectopic expression of Id1 did not influence the transcription of pAKV6CAT ( Fig .

However , the ALF1-mediated transcriptional activation was significantly reduced when we coexpressed Id1 with ALF1 ( Fig .

served with the pSL3-3CAT construct as well ( Fig .
5C ) .
Thus , Id1 may function as a repressor of ALF1-mediated MLV transcription in vivo .
Id1 represses MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines .
The bHLH protein complexes from lymphoid cell nuclear extracts that were found to interact with the E , , , motifs are targets for dissociation by Id proteins ( Fig .
2 ) .
It deserves notice that covalent linking between the protein members in class A bHLH homodimers has been identified ( 3 ) and that Id proteins dissociate TAL1-E2A heterodimers inefficiently ( 16 , 30 ) .
In the L691-6 T-cell line , ectopic expression of Id1 resulted in a 50 % reduction in the transcriptional activity from pAKV6 CAT ( Table 2 ) .
Use of the pE ( ab ) CAT construct showed that repression by Id1 required intact E , , , motifs ( Table 2 ) .
That ectopic Id1 in a T-cell line can function as a transcriptional regulator by mediating MLV transcriptional repression verifies that class A bHLH proteins are important Akv MLV transcription factors in T-cell lines .
Use of the pSL3-3CAT construct as a reporter showed that Id1 also has the capacity to regulate SL3-3 MLV 's transcriptional level ( Table 2 ) .
Thus , the existence of identical E-boxes in Akv and SL3-3 MLV enhancers resulted in the same response to Id1 protein in a T-cell line .
In B-cell lines ( Mpc11 and J558L ) , ectopic expression of Id1 again resulted in a roughly 50 % reduction of transcription from the pSL3-3CAT construct ( Table 2 ) .
pAKV6CAT was not repressed by ectopic expression of Id1 in the B-cell lines under the experimental conditions used for the T-cell line , i.e. , use of 5 pg of CAT reporter construct ( Table 2 ) .
However , by using a smaller amount of Aky MLV reporter construct ( 1 ug ) , a repression by Id1 was detectable , confirming that Akvy MLV was under transcriptional regulation by class A bHLH proteins in B-cell lines ( Table 2 ) .
Thus , although Akvy MLV and SL3-3 MLV carry almost the same set of E-box sequences , they did not respond exactly alike to ectopic Id1 in the B-cell lines tested , indicating that sequences outside the E-boxes are important determinants for cell-type-directed function of the E-boxes in Aky MLV and SL3-3 MLV .
DISCUSSION For study of transcriptional regulation , MLVs represent an excellent model system , with their regulatory sequences localized in a well-defined DNA segment in the LTR and with regulation dependent exclusively on cellular transcription factors .
By electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we found that the two types of promoter-enhancer-localized E-boxes , E. , , and Ea , g , in Aky MLV and SL3-3 MLV bind distinct protein complexes .
Supershift analysis using specific antibodies directed against ALF1 or HEB or EZA showed that the E , , , E-boxes bound ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins in nuclear extracts from lymphoid cell lines , whereas the E , , E-box complex did not include ALF1 or HEB or EZA .
The E , , , E-box complex was found to include both ALF1 or HEB and E2ZA , suggesting the existence of a heterodimer .
Previous reports have described such a heterodimeric E-box binding complex ( 38 ) .
Nuclear extracts from NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells included no E-box-binding capacity of ALF1 or EZA proteins .
In transfection analysis , we showed that ALF1 , HEB or E2A homodimeric protein complexes transactivated transcription from the Akv MLV enhancer to the same level as when the proteins were coexpressed ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , there is no synergistic effect of ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins .
However , a putative heterodimer-ization may result in stabilization compared with the relatively labile homodimer complex , e.g. , resulting in greater resistance to dissociation , as observed for EZ2A-TAL1 heterodimers ( 16 , 30 ) , or a changed DNA specificity , which we were not able to observe using the MLV E-boxes .
We should draw attention to the fact that homodimeric ALF1/HEB and E2A proteins have different preferred DNA-binding sites ( 5 , 42 ) .
Some of the E-box complexes detected in this work did not contain ALF1 or ALF2 or E2A proteins .
Complexes formed on E , , , and without class A bHLH components might be transcriptional repressors , as proposed for E-boxes in immunoglobulin enhancers , in which the transcriptional repressor ZEB regulates transcriptional regulation through E-box sequences 11 ) .
( B ) y introduction of mutations in the Akv MLV E-boxes , we examined their putative function as targets for activators and repressors .
In fibroblasts and HeLa cells , mutation of the E-boxes only moderately affected the transcriptional activity .
This is in accordance with the absence of functional class A bHLH E-box DNA-binding activity in fibroblasts ( Fig .
2 ) .
Analysis of Aky MLV reporter constructs with mutations in the two E , , , E-boxes ( A and B ) and the Ea , , showed that the expression was reduced to 10 to 20 % of that of the parental Aky MLV reporter , suggesting a very central role in the enhancer function of E-box-binding proteins either alone or in a larger complex with other proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation .
This shows that the E-boxes in the enhancer region are essential for proper Aky MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines and suggests an important role for the observed E-box-binding ALF1 or HEB and EZA proteins in Aky MLV transcriptional regulation ( Fig .
2 and Table 1 ) .
In T-cell lines , mutation of each of the E , , , E-boxes and E , , reduced the transcriptional activity equally , and the double mutation decreased the activity even further in L691-6 cells ( Table 1 ) .
Interestingly , in B-cell lines , the promoter-proximal enhancer E-box , E , , _ ( B ) , was most important for Akv expression , indicating a different composition of the E-box binding complex in T- and B-cell lines .
5900 NIELSEN ET AL .
Ectopic expression of ALF1 in NIH 3T3 cells showed that ALF ] transactivated equivalently through the two enhancer E , , , E-boxes , similar to the situation of E-box regulation in T-cell lines , whereas overexpression of the E2A protein , E2-5 , transactivated with preference through the more promoter proximal of the enhancer E-boxes , E , ,\ ( B ) , equivalent to the E-box requirement in B-cell lines ( Fig .
4 ) .
The different E-box requirements in E2A protein E2-5- and ALF1-mediated transcriptional activation suggest that these two very homologous proteins contact the transcriptional machinery formed on the MLV promoter-enhancer differently .
The only known function of the family of Id proteins is to repress the function of class A bHLH proteins .
We have measured the effect of Id overexpression to see if repression may be detected in MLV transcription .
Id1 was previously described to be a repressor of DNA binding and of transcriptional activation by EZ2A proteins ( 4 , 19 , 43 ) .
We found that Id1 repressed ALF1 DNA binding in vitro and that ectopic expression of Id1 resulted in a decrease in ALF1l-mediated transactivation of Aky MLV and SL3-3 MLV transcription in vivo .
Thus , Id1 has the characteristics expected for a repressor of ALF1l-mediated transcriptional activation .
According to this , we found that in a T-cell line ectopic Id1 repressed transcription of Aky MLV and SL3-3 MLV .
Repression by Id1 required intact E.. , motifs ( Table 2 ) .
This is in agreement with our observations showing that the E , , , motifs , and not the Ex , motif , bind class A bHLH protein-including protein complexes ( Fig .
2 ) .
We found different sensitivities to Id repression of Akv and SL3-3 MLV expression in B-cell lines .
This may reflect various concentrations of endogenous bHLH proteins in the different cell types .
