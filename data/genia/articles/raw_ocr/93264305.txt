Abstract Stimulation of highly purified human T-cells via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules induces and maintains proliferation for more than 3 weeks .
This potent interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent activation does not require monocytes or accessory cells .
Long-lasting IL-2 receptivity is associated with high-level expression of the inducible IL-2 receptor a chain ( /L-2Ra ) gene that is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .
Increase of IL-2Ra gene transcription involves the enhanced binding of the transcription factor NF- « B to its consensus sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the IL-2Ra gene .
To dissect the molecular basis for the unusually persistent transcription of the IL-2Ra gene , we analyzed nuclear NF- « B binding to a radiolabeled IL-2Ra « B-specific oligonucleotide probe during the time course of CD24+CD28 activation .
Resting T-cell nuclear extracts contained KBF1/p50 homodimer .
After stimulation , two new « B-specific complexes were identified as NF- « B p50-p65 heterodimer and putative c-Rel homodimer or c-Rel-p65 heterodimer .
Both inducible complexes persisted for at least 3 weeks .
Their relative levels were very similar for the duration of proliferation .
In parallel , CD2+CD28 activation triggered a significant intracellular thiol decrease , suggesting that oxygen radicals are involved in the signaling pathway of adhesion molecules .
Finally , micromolar amounts of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an oxygen radical scavenger that efficiently blocked the nuclear appearance of NF- « B in T-lymphocytes , also inhibited IL-2 secretion , IL-2Ra cell surface expression , and T-cell proliferation .
Together , these results suggest that NF- « B plays an important role in long-term activation of human primary T-lymphocytes via CD2+CD28 .

Introduction In vitro , T-lymphocyte activation requires combined action of two signals provided by different combinations of lectins , phorbol esters , cytokines , or mAbs . ''
Two main activation pathways have been described : the antigen-dependent pathway , involving the CD3/TcR complex , and the adhesion molecule pathway , engaging CD2 and CD28 surface molecules .
CD2 , first described as the sheep erythrocyte receptor , is present on nearly all T-lymphocytes .
Its major natural ligand , the lymphocyte function associated 3 surface molecule , is of wide cellular and tissular distribution ( 1 ) .
CD28 molecule is present on only half of the CD8-positive resting T-cells but on almost all of the CD4-positive cells ( 2 ) .
CD28 shares with CTLA-4 its ligand B7/BB1 .
B7/BB1 has a more restricted distri-bution , since it is expressed only on activated T-lymphocytes , y-interferon-treated monocytes , and mouse den-dritic thymic cells ( 3-5 ) .
Both pathways can be mimicked by in vitro use of mAbs directed against these molecules ( 6-10 ) .
Simultaneous activation of CD2 and CD28 leads to a long-lasting proliferation ( > 3 weeks versus 10 days for the CD3/TcR pathway ) of highly purified human T-lymphocytes ( 11 ) .
CD2+CD28-triggered proliferation does not require the presence of monocytes or accessory cells but depends strongly on IL-2 secretion by the T-cells ( 9 , 10 ) .
This long-lasting , IL-2-dependent autocrine or paracrine proliferation is apparently sustained by a persistent high-level expression of its high-affinity receptor .
Following CD2+CD28 costimulation , and /L-2Ra genes are differentially regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels ( 11-14 ) .
Several constitutive and inducible cis-acting regulatory sequences and trans-acting factors involved in their regulation have now been identified ( for a review , see Ref .
15 ) .
Among the inducible factors , recent attention has focused on the role of NF- « B in the induction of genes involved in T-cell growth ( for a review , see Ref .
16 ) .
T-cells stimulated by various stimuli activate the NF- « B transcription factor and related proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 and /L-2Ra genes .
The NF- « B transcription factor , identified originally as an immunoglobulin x light chain enhancer-binding complex ( 17 ) , is associated with the inducible expression of a large number of genes ( for a review , see Ref .
18 ) .
NF- « B is a member of a novel family of transcription factors including the two NF- « B * The abbreviations used are : mAb , monoclonal antibody ; iL-2 , interleukin 2 ; -R , receptor ; PMA , 46-phorbol 12-myristate 13a-acetate ; NF , nuclear factor ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; PDTC , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ; ROI , reactive oxygen intermediates ; PHA , phytohemag-glutinin ; kDa , kilodalton ( s } ; TNF-a , tumor necrosis factor a ; TPA , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ; GM-CSF , - granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ; ELISA , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ; MCB , monochlorobimane .

19 and 20 ) .
The amino-terminal portions of these proteins also share amino acid sequence homology with the product of the morphogen dorsal gene from Drosophila melanogaster .
The homology domain was shown to encompass dimerization , nuclear targeting , and DNA and IkB binding domains .
With respect to the adhesion molecule pathway , a transcription study in Jurkat T-cells has demonstrated that the NF- « B binding sites of the human immunodefi-ciency virus 1 long terminal repeat are required for signaling by CD28 ( 21 ) .
in vitro binding studies using Jurkat T-cell nuclear extracts have demonstrated that CD28-induced signal synergizes with either PMA or CD3 for the induction of nuclear factors that bind CD28RE , a « B-like motif of the IL-2 enhancer ( 13 , 14 ) .
Finally , nuclear extracts from PMA-activated Jurkat T-cells produce two distinct complexes in EMSAs when incubated with the « B element from the /L-2Ra gene ( 22 ) .
Following activation , nuclear appearance of these proteins is induced with distinct biphasic kinetics , suggesting that the T-lymphocyte gene activation program might involve modulation of NF- « B subunit composition .
A recent report has shown that the nuclear expression of NF- « B is activated by binding of IL-2 to its receptor in purified primary resting human T-cells ( 23 ) .
However , to date , no study has addressed the activation of NF- « B in human purified T-lymphocytes activated via the adhesion molecules CD2 and CD28 .
Rapid induction of NF- « B nuclear activity is regulated at a posttranscriptional level , involving the release of an inhibitory factor , I « B , from a preformed cytoplasmic protein complex .
in vitro , dissociation can be triggered by treatment with detergent , low pH , protein kinases , and protein phosphatases ( for a review , see Ref .
24 ) .
The modification releasing I « B in the intact cell is not known but is likely to involve phosphorylation events .
Activation of NF- « B is triggered by a wide variety of mostly pathogenic agents ( for a review , see Ref .
18 ) .
In T-cells , in contrast to macrophages and monocytes , for instance , the NF- « B activating signals are mitogenic and encompass treatment of cells with phorbol ester , lectins , antigen , monoclonal antibodies , and infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type I .
Various genes encoding IxB proteins have been cloned , including MAD-3 ( 25 ) , pp40 ( 26 ) , bei-3 ( 27 , 28 ) , IkBy ( 29 ) , and RF/IF-1 ( 30 ) .
I « B-like proteins contain an ankyrin-like repeat domain also found in the carboxy-terminal part of the p105 and p100 precursors of NF- « B p50 and p49 ( for a review , see Ref .
20 ) .
The ankyrin repeat is apparently involved in complex formation with NF- « B complexes by contacting the rel homology domain .
IxB-like factors display distinct affinity in vitro for NF- « B/Rel complexes ( 31 ) .
Several recent studies indicate that distinct combinations of NF- « B subunits could determine the specificity of transcriptional activation through modulation of NF- « B binding to the various « B motifs ( 20 , 32-34 ) .
The availability of inhibitor and activator subunits allows separation of functions in signal transduction pathways .
This may explain the apparent paradox between NF- « B activation by many inducers , on one hand , and the specificity of regulation of gene expression , on the other .
Parant ranmrte havo chum that arctivatinn hy by compounds such as L-cysteine , N-acetyl -- cysteine , or PDTC ( 35-38 ) .
The chemical basis for cysteine and PDTC inhibiting effects seemed to lie in the oxygen radical-scavenging activity of sulfur-containing groups .
This suggests that ROI are important and widely used messengers in the activation of NF- « B ( 36 ) .
In contrast to our precise knowledge about NF- « B structure and interaction with I « kB and enhancer ele-ments , only a few studies have assessed its physiological role in primary human T-cells ( 23 , 39-41 ) .
Here , we investigated the role of NF- « B in the adhesion molecule activation as mimicked by anti-CD2 and anti-CD28 treatment of purified human T-cells .
The unique long-term T-cell activation induced by these mAbs ( 9 , 11 , 42 , 43 ) was further characterized in terms of proliferation , IL-2 secretion , and receptivity .
In parallel , an EMSA was used to detect NF- « B-related complexes present in nuclear extracts prepared from CD2+CD28-activated T-cells , and the different subunits of NF- « B family members were identified by DNA-protein UV-cross-linking assays and NF- « B-specific antisera .
We analyzed the effect of PDTC , a potent inhibitor of NF- « B activation , to evaluate the role of NF- « B complexes in CD2+CD28-triggered proliferation and cytokine synthesis .
Thiol level variations were determined by flow cytometry to assess the involvement of ROI in the onset of CD24+CD28 T-cell activation .
Our results show that T-cell activation by the adhesion molecule pathway leads to long-term activation of NF- « B .
The functional significance of this event is supported by pharmacological experiments with an inhibitor of NF- « B activation .
Finally , evidence is provided that induction of NF- « B nuclear appearance relies on a prooxidant state of peripheral T-cells .
Results Characterization of T-Lymphocyte Activation through the CD2/CD28 Adhesion Molecule Pathway .
Purified human T-lymphocyte activation by CD2 and CD28 mAbs was characterized in terms of proliferation , IL-2 secretion , and receptivity .
The T-cell proliferation rate was measured by incorporation ( Fig .
1A ) .
Stimulation with CD28 mAb associated with CD2 mAb induced high-level proliferation compared to the CD3¢+CD28 combination .
Both proliferations lasted for at least 3 weeks .
In contrast , CD3¢ alone triggered stimulation for only 1 week .
CD2 or CD28 mAb or medium alone induced no or very little ( < 1000 cpm ) proliferation .
CD2+CD28 costimulation induced a higher level of IL-2 secretion than CD3c+CD28 , and IL-2 remained measurable at least until day 7 , compared to day 4 for CD3c+CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
1B ) .
Cumulative IL-2 secretion was 2 times higher with CD2+CD28 stimulus than CD3c+CD28 .
Single stimulus CD3c , CD2 , CD28 , or medium alone did not induce detectable IL-2 secre-tion .
- Both combined stimuli ( CD2+CD28 - or CD3c¢+CD28 ) induced high-level cell surface expression of IL-2Ra chain , reaching 80 and 83 % of positive cells , respectively , at 6 days ( Fig .
1C ) .
However , CD2+CD28-induced IL-2Ra expression persisted for at least 3 weeks as opposed to that of CD3c¢+CD28 , which decreased after 2 weeks .
CD3¢ alone induced a relatively weaker ( peak , 53 % ) and shorter IL-2Ra expression ( < 10 days ) .

Characterization of CD2+CD28 costimulation of purified human T-lymphocytes compared to CD3¢ and CD3¢+CD28 stimulations .
Stimulations were performed with different mAbs used at saturating concentrations : CD2 mAb 39C1.5 and 6F10.3 ; CD3¢ mAb 289 .
Total cell numbers were counted microscopically by phase contrast , and the number of dead cells was determined by trypan blue uptake .

CD2+CD28 or CD3¢+CD28 combination induced high levels of soluble IL-2 receptor , in contrast to CD3c alone .
Both combined stimuli induced comparable total amounts of soluble IL-2 receptor , with higher levels for CD3¢+CD28 at 14 days .
In conclusion , CD2 and CD28 costimulation induced a long-lasting proliferation of primary T-cell culture for up to 3 weeks .
In sharp contrast , CD3¢ alone and other stimuli , such as PHA+1IL-2 or PHA+PMA , support at best 1-week-long proliferation ( 9 ) .
Previous studies demonstrated that following activation , IL-2Ra chains released from the membrane could bind IL-2 efficiently and inhibit IL-2 cellular uptake ( 44 , 45 ) .
We do not believe that these observations are of relevance for the IL-2-dependent CD2+CD28 stimulation ( 9 , 10 ) , since high levels of soluble IL-2R correlated positively with proliferation .
In comparison with other stimuli that induce transient expression , we also observed that CD2+CD28 stimulation induced high-level IL-2 secretion and receptivity .
NF- « B Activation after CD24+CD28 Costimulation .
In regard to the putative central role of NF- « B in T-lymphocyte activation , we investigated whether CD2+CD28 costimulation efficiently induced nuclear NF- « B in primary human T-cells .
« B-binding proteins present in nuclear extracts of T-cells treated by different stimuli were first detected by EMSA with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe containing the NF- « B binding site of the « Ig light chain enhancer ( 17 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
All three stimuli strongly induced a slow-migrating complex of comparable levels ( Fig .
2 , Lane 2 compared to Lanes 5 , 8 , and 11 ) .
In addition , untreated and stimulated cell nuclear extracts both contained an intense , faster-migrating protein-DNA complex .
To demonstrate the sequence specificity of these complexes , we performed competition assays in the presence of excess unlabeled wild-type or mutant « B DNA competitor oligonucleotides .
The more intense , faster-migrating complex was not a bona fide NF- « B-specific complex , since it was almost equally competed by wild-type and mutant competitor oligonucleotides .
In contrast , wild-type competitor completely abrogated the inducible upper complex ( Fig .
2 , Lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ) whereas the mutant « Ig motif was ineffective ( Fig .
2 , Lanes 4 , 7 , 10 , and 11 ) .
These data show that peripheral human T-cells respond to extracellular stimuli by activation of NF- « B , as previously reported for tumoral T-cell lines ( 18 ) and for primary resting human T-cells in the presence of exogenous IL-2 ( 23 ) .
Long-Term Expression of Nuclear Induced « B1-22 , -Pro-tein Complexes in CD24CD28-stimulated T-Lymphocytes .
The long-lasting cell surface expression of CD25/ IL-2Ra ( Fig .
1C ) , apparently sustained by the transcriptional activation of its encoding gene ( 11 ) , prompted us to perform a kinetic study of NF- « B nuclear activation using the « B motif from the IL-2Ra promoter and nuclear extracts prepared from T-cells harvested from 3 h up to 332 NF- « B Activation in CD2+CD28-stimulated Primary T-Cells Fig .

Demonstration that T-cell activation via CD2+CD28 induced long-lasting ( > 3 weeks ) nuclear expression of « Bi.22 , DNA-binding pro-teins .
Highly purified human T-lymphocytes were incubated at 37°C with CD2 and CD28 mAbs ( see `` Materials and Methods '' ) .
After increasing times of incubation , cell samples were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C , rapidly cooled in ice water , and kept frozen at -80°C until nuclear extract preparation .
Nuclear extracts were prepared simultaneously when all cell samples were harvested .
Equal amounts of proteins ( 1 ug/reaction ) were analyzed for « B-specific DNA binding in EMSAs using a **P-labeled DNA probe containing the wild-type binding site for NF- « 8 from the /L-2Ra gene promoter .

As shown in Fig .

2 ) .
This pattern is specific to the « Bir .
motif , as it was also observed after CD3 and TPA stimulation ( data not shown ) .
Nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells contained two protein-DNA complexes , C and D. The intensity of band C was variable depending on the batch of T-cell preparation used ( six independent preparations ) but was always detectable in nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells .
In contrast , two new retarded bands , designated A and B ( Fig .
3 , Lane 1 compared to Lane 2 ) , appeared after stimulation .
A and B complexes were present in nearly identical amounts in nuclear extracts of T-cells harvested between 3 h and 3 weeks after CD2+CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
3 , Lanes 2-9 ) .
In conclusion , CD2+CD28 costimulation leads to the persistent appearance of two /L-2Ra « B-binding activities in nuclei of peripheral T-cells .
Characterization of « Bu. » r.-Protein Complexes .
We performed competition experiments with a set of specific and nonspecific unlabeled oligonucleotides to determine the DNA binding specificity of the complexes binding to the « Bir .
probe .
As shown in Fig .
4A , Lanes 4-6 , a 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to « kB sites of IL-2Ra , IL-2 , or IL-6 almost completely abrogated the three upper bands A , B , and C. In contrast , SP1 or mutant « lg oligonucleotides had little effect on these bands ( Fig .
4A , Lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The faster-migrating intense D complex was apparently nonspecific .
To characterize the three « Bi sr. , -specific complexes , we included five different NF- « B antisera in binding reaction mixtures ( Fig .
4B ) .
Rabbit antisera to portions of Cell Growth & Differentiation v ¢ A aA A A OCO U > 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 recombinant p50 , p65 , and c-Rel were used ( 30 ) .
As reported by Kieran et al .
( 46 ) , anti-p50 no .
2 recognizes both KBF1/p50 homodimer and NF- « B p50-p65 complexes , whereas anti-p50 no .
3 recognizes only KBF1/ p50 homodimer .
In addition , complexes were tested for inhibition by the recombinant I « B protein MAD-3 , * which inhibits DNA binding of both NF- « B and c-Rel ( 25 ) .
As expected from competition experiments , the nonspecific band D was unaffected by the different antisera or recombinant MAD-3 in binding reaction mixtures ( Fig .
4B , Lanes 2-8 ) .
Constitutively expressed band C disappeared in the presence of serum anti-p50 and antisera no .

The resultant DNA-protein complexes were - resolved on 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .

Nuclear extracts were prepared as above and incubated with `` P-labeled « B , probe in the presence of specific NF- « B antisera and recombinant MAD-3/l « B as indicated at top of lanes using conditions previously described by Kieran et al .

3 antisera had no effect ( Fig .
4B , Lanes 2 , 4 , and 7 ) .
We concluded that band B corresponded to NF- « B p50-p65 heterodimers .
The nature of band A was more puz-zling .
None of the five antisera significantly affected the formation of this inducible « Buse .
complex ( Fig .
4B , Lanes 2-4 , 6 , and 7 ) .
However , incubation with recombinant MAD-3 completely inhibited band A ( Fig .
4B , Lane 8 ) , indicating that the inducible complex A contained at least one NF- « B/c-Rel-like subunit able to interact with MAD-3 .
The absence of reactivity with anti-p65 or anti-c-Rel does not necessarily exclude the presence of p65 or c-Rel subunits in complex A , since epitopes could be masked upon dimer formation or upon binding to DNA .
UV-cross-linking experiments were performed to further characterize the inducible bands A and B ( Fig .
4C ) .
Complex A revealed only one polypeptide at 94 kDa , a 333 334 - NF- « B Activation in CO2+CD28-stimulated Primary T-Cells size relatively close to 85 kDa , the reported size of c-Rel protein adduct ( 47 ) ( Fig .
4C , Lane 1 ) .
Alternatively , complex A could correspond to R « B , a 107 kDa product encoded by a gene recently cloned ( 48 ) .
R « B was originally characterized as a « Biu.r , DNA-binding complex present in PMA-induced Jurkat T-cell nuclear extracts .
However , this protein is related to the regulatory protein MyoD but not to the NF- « B gene family , since it lacks the Rel homology domain .
Despite the lack of effect of antisera , we tentatively identified complex A as a c-Rel-like protein homodimer or a c-Rel-p65 complex in accordance with recombinant MAD-3 inhibition .
As expected from antisera characterization , band B elicited a pattern of radiolabeled proteins very similar to the composition of the late-phase NF- « B complex present in PMA-induced Jurkat T-cell nuclear extracts ( 22 ) .
As reported by Molitor et al .
( 22 ) , the major 57 kDa polypeptide most probably corresponds to NF- « B p50 , and the 124 kDa adduct to NF- « B p50 and p65 subunits both cross-linked to the same probe .
Finally , in accordance with the apparent constant pattern of NF- « B complexes revealed by EMSA ( Fig .
2 ) , similar results were obtained when experiments were performed using nuclear extracts prepared at 3 h , 24 h , and 3 weeks after CD2+CD28 costimulation ( data not shown ) .
CD24+CD28 Activation of T-Cells Depleted Intracellular Thiols .
On the basis of u-cysteine and N-acetyl-L-cysteine effects , intracellular thiol levels appear to play a key role in NF- « B activation in Jurkat T-cells stimulated by PMA and TNF-a ( 35 , 38 ) .
To evaluate thiol involvement in T-cell activation by CD24+CD28 , we measured by flow cytometry the levels of glutathione , the major intracellular ROI scavenger ( 38 , 49 , 50 ) .
We used an assay based on monochlorobimane , a membrane-per-meant nonfluorescent substrate that becomes fluorescent after reaction with a sulfhydryl group ( 38 ) .
Within cells , it is almost exclusively coupled to glutathione by glutathione-S-transferase ( 49 ) .
In accordance with a role of oxidative stress in transduction of CD2+CD28-triggered signals , we observed a rapid decrease in total thiol content following T-cell activation ( Fig .
5 ) .
A comparative flow cytometry distribution of control unstimulated cells ( a , mean fluorescence 98 ) and CD2+CD28-triggered cells 15 min after stimulation ( b , mean fluorescence 75 ) is shown in Fig .
5A .
This representative experiment , of four experiments performed , demonstrated a significant decrease ( 23.5 % ) of relative thiol levels .
Flow cytometry distribution evidenced a heterogeneity in the populational thiol content of stimulated cells , in contrast to resting lymphocytes .
Heterogeneity of thiol levels could be interpreted as the consequence of differential CD2 and CD28 T-cell surface expression .
Although CD2 is expressed in nearly all cells , only 50 % of CD8+ T-lymphocytes express CD28 ( 2 ) .
During the early phase of CD2+CD28 stimulation , half of the CD8+ cells ( ap-proximately 20 % of the whole population ) are not directly triggered , and therefore , their intracellular thiol level remains at the basal level until a second signal is provided ( such as IL-2 secretion by CD4+ cells ) .
in an attempt to correlate thiol level variation and long-term activation , we performed a kinetic study of intracellular thiol levels during T-lymphocyte activation ( Fig .

Effects of thiol compounds on the activation of NF- « B via CD2+CD28 T-cell stimulation .
Purified T-cells were stimulated with CD2 and CD28 mAbs for 24 h , in the absence ( Lanes 1-3 ) and presence ( Lanes 4-7 ) of the indicated compounds .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for xB-specific DNA binding in EMSA using a « ig motif .
As indicated at top of the lanes , the effects of PDTC on nuclear CD2+CD28-induced NF- « B were tested at concentrations between 1 am and 0.01 um .
Pyrrolidine , a cyclic molecule structurally related to PDTC but lacking a dithiocarboxy group , was used as a negative control at 1 mm .

PDTC Inhibits the Nuclear Activation of NF- « B by CD24+CD28 .
Previous results have shown that activation of NF- « B in intact cells can be blocked by radical-scavenging compounds ( 36 , 37 , 51 ) .
Among several dithio-carbamate derivatives tested , PDTC , as a potent NF- « B inhibitor , was best suited for tumor cell culture experiments ( 37 ) .
Consequently , we analyzed the in vivo effects of PDTC on purified T-lymphocytes .
Phenotypic and biochemical analyses were performed in parallel using the same cell cultures in the presence of increasing amounts of PDTC .
Gel retardation analyses confirmed that PDTC efficiently inhibited the CD2+CD28-induced NF- « B activation in purified T-lymphocytes ( Fig .
6 ) .
The NF- « B detected by the « B. , , probe were fully inhibited in the presence of 1 um PDTC ( Fig .
6 , Lane 4 compared to Lanes 5 and 6 ) .
In sharp contrast , 1 mm pyrrolidine , the end product of PDTC oxidation but lacking a dithiocarboxy group , had no detectable effect ( Fig .

Comparable results were obtained with the « Bu > r .

- Effects of thiol compounds on CD2+CD28-induced T-cell proliferation , cytokine synthesis , and receptivity .
Purified T-lymphocytes were stimulated via CD2+CD28 in the presence or absence of PDTC ( ex-pressed in um ) used at different concentrations between 10 um and 0.01 um as indicated at bottom of bars .
Thiol compounds and specific mAbs were added simultaneously in cell culture .
As controls , CD2+CD28-stimulated T-cell cultures without any thiol compound or with pyrrolidine ( pyrro ; used at a 1 mm concentration ) were performed .
Cell viability was controlled microscopically by trypan blue exclusion and in no case was less than 90 % .
Thiol compound effects on T-lymphocyte proliferation ( A ) were measured at 24 h by [ °H ] thymidine incorporation .
After the third day ( data not shown } , proliferation was restored to the same level as controls , showing the absence of significant toxicity and demonstrating the reversibility of PDTC effects on T-cell proliferation .
The effects of PDTC on IL-2 ( 8 ) and GM-CSF ( D ) secretion were measured at peak secretion ( 24 h and 96 h , respectively ) with an ELISA assay .
Thiol compounds did not interfere with the titration method ( data not shown } .
CD25/IL-2Ra cell surface expression in the presence of PDTC was determined at 36 h by flow cytometry ( C ) .
PDTC did not interfere with flow cytometry analysis ( data not shown ) .
ment of NF- « B in T-cell activation , we measured the proliferation rate , cytokine synthesis , and IL-2 receptivity in the same cell cultures used for EMSA analysis ( see Fig .
7 ) .
T-cell proliferation was evaluated by [ ' H Ithymidine incorporation 24 h after stimulation via CD2+CD28 in the presence of the drug ( Fig .
7A ) .
PDTC at concentrations between 10 and 1 um completely abrogated T-cell proliferation but had no effect on thymidine incorporation below 0.1 um PDTC , as compared to no addition or 1 mm pyrrolidine .
Cell viability remained better than 90 % ( data not shown ) , a result demonstrating that PDTC was nontoxic for purified T-lymphocytes under our experimental conditions .
Furthermore , the effect of PDTC was reversible , as [ H ] thymidine incorporation in PDTC-treated cells was restored to control levels after 48 h ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , IL-2 secretion was less sensitive to PDTC concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 um ( Fig .
7B ) .
However , secretion was completely abrogated at 10 um .
Similarly , IL-2 receptivity , estimated by CD25/IL-2Ra cell surface expression ( Fig .
7C ) , was abolished only when the PDTC concentration reached 10 um .
GM-CSF , another T-cell-secreted cytokine not directly involved in CD2+CD28 T-cell activation , but whose promoter contains a functional « B motif ( 18 ) , showed a sensitivity to PDTC comparable to that of IL-2 secretion ( Fig .
7D ) .
These results show that primary T-cells can be kept alive without withdrawal of the drug for at least 4 days at PDTC concentrations that are optimal for inhibition of NF- « B and cytokine secretion and receptivity .
Further 336 - NF- « B Activation in CD2+CD28-stimulated Primary T-Cells more , they confirm the positive correlation between NF- « B - activation - and CD2+CD28-induced - T-cell proliferation .
Discussion The large majority of studies on the role of NF- « B in T-cell activation were performed with tumor cell lines which exhibit biological characteristics that are not manifested by primary T-lymphocytes ( for a review , see Ref .
16 ) .
For instance , only one recent report has emphasized these differences with respect to the function of NF- « B ( 40 ) .
To further investigate the role of NF- « B in normal human T-cells , we analyzed the nuclear appearance of NF- « B in highly purified T-cells activated by monoclonal antibodies directed against CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules .
The data presented here support the hypothesis that NF- « B plays an important role in activation and long-term maintenance of proliferation of human primary T-lymphocytes stimulated via CD2 and CD28 .
How Is the Long-Term Activation of NF- « B Achieved ?
In contrast to the results described for the Jurkat T-cell line treated by PMA , we have observed , using EMSA with a « Bu. » r , probe : ( a ) constitutive expression of a homodi-meric complex of the NF- « B p50 subunit , ( b ) the appearance of two new NF- « B complexes 3 h after stimulation , and ( c ) a long-lasting maintenance ( 3 weeks ) of their relative levels .
In parallel , we observed a rapid and transient ( < 20 h ) decrease in thiol level after CD2+CD28 stimulation .
Finally , we demonstrated that nontoxic amounts of PDTC fully abrogated the activation of NF- « B and inhibited proliferation of CD2+CD28-stimulated purified T-cells .
The variation of thiol level and the effects of PDTC evidenced a role for oxidoreduction mechanisms in T-cell activation through the adhesion molecules .
However , as could be predicted in view of the inhibiting effects of prolonged thiol depletion in human purified T-cells ( 52 ) , cellular regulation mechanisms quickly restored the basal level after the thiol decrease induced by CD2 and CD28 costimulation .
This suggests that intracellular oxidant stress is one of the first phenomena in T-cell activation , but a fine balance of oxidoreduction status is required , since prolonged oxidative stress is deleteri-ous .
We propose that the initial induction of NF- « B via CD2+CD28 relies , at least in part , on a prooxidant state of peripheral T-cells .
A functional study is under way to assess in more detail the role of thiol level depletion during T-cell stimulation in correlation with NF- « B activation .
In the human promyelocytic cell line HL60 stimulated by TNF-a or PMA , maintenance of NF- « B activity was reported to depend on de novo protein synthesis and the continuous presence of external stimuli ( 53 ) .
Furthermore , the level of the 3.8-kilobase mRNA encoding the NF- « B p50 subunit is increased upon stimulation .
Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that the promoter of p50 can be activated by either of the two subunits of NF- « B ( p50 and p65 ) and more strongly by the combination of both ( 54 ) .
To investigate whether such a mechanism could be involved during long-term CD2+CD28 stimulation , analysis of NF- « B gene family expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels is under way .
What Are the Roles of the Various « B Complexes ?
A new physiological function has recently been suggested for p50 homodimers in the T-cell response ( 40 ) .
For instance , in a nontransformed CD4+ T-lymphocyte clone , p50 homodimers present in resting cells seem to inhibit IL-2 gene expression .
After antigenic activation , the amount of homodimer decreased , whereas the amount of the p50-p65 heterodimer increased .
In parallel , induced expression of the ! L-2 gene and activity of the IL-2 « B-DNA binding site correlated with a decrease in the p50-p50 complex .
Furthermore , overexpression of p50 repressed IL-2 promoter activity .
In contrast , upon CD2+CD28 stimulation , we detected an additional inducible Rel-like complex and no significant variation in p50-p50 amounts .
We propose that these discrepancies are due to differences in stimulation conditions , « B probes , and cell population .
On the basis of the putative mechanism of NF- « B action , CD2 and CD28 costimulation could induce sufficient amounts of NF- « B p50-p65 and c-Rel complexes to remove p50-p50 dimer inhibitory block .
Such a hypothesis is reinforced by the recent identification of c-Rel as one component of the Rel/NF- « B family proteins involved in the « B-dependent activation of ! L-2Ra gene expression ( 55 ) .
How Are the Functional Effects of PDTC in Human Primary T-Lymphocytes Explained ?
In agreement with its blocking effect in response to many NF- « B inducers ( 36 , 37 ) , PDTC inhibited CD24+CD28 induction of NF- « B nuclear appearance , and , since cell viability was not af-fected , we demonstrated that PDTC is well suited for experiments using primary T-cells .
However , in contrast to inhibition of proliferation and NF- « B activation , a somewhat higher PDTC concentration ( > 10 um versus 1 um ) was required to impair cytokine expression and receptivity .
Although several independent studies are consistent with a potential role for oxidation-reduction in the control of NF- « B , the exact mechanism involved has not yet been characterized ( 36 , 38 , 56 , 57 ) .
PDTC has at least two chemical properties .
In addition to its oxygen radical-scavenging effect , PDTC also has a chelating activity for heavy metals that could interfere with metal-dependent enzymes .
Both mechanisms seem to be involved in Jurkat T-cells treated by several inducers , such as H ; O ; , PMA , or TNF-a ( 37 ) .
However , NF- « B inhibition required considerably lower PDTC concentrations ( 1 um versus 100 gm ) in primary T-cells than in the tumoral Jurkat T-cell line ( Ref .
37 and this report ) .
Furthermore , we did not observe desensitization to the drug , as reported in Jurkat T-cells ( 37 ) , but a high cell toxicity above 100 am PDTC ( data not shown ) .
Finally , inhibition did not require prein-cubation , as inhibitor and inducers were added simultaneously in our experiments .
Our observations are one more example of differences between the tumor cell line and the primary T-cell .
We propose that the observed discrepancies are due to differences in experimental conditions in which , on one hand , the drug was added to actively dividing cells and , on the other , to resting T-cells before the CD2+CD28-triggered Go-G : transition .
Furthermore , upon simultaneous addition of inducers and inhibitor , enough active NF- « B could be transiently present in the nucleus and participate in cytokine and receptor gene induction .
To test this hypothesis , further Cell Growth & Differentiation 337 experiments are necessary to determine NF- « B half-life and turnover rate in the nucleus .
In conclusion , although our data support the involvement of oxidative stress and the requirement of NF-kB maintenance for long-term primary T-cell proliferation , they also suggest the engagement of other regulatory factors .
Consequently , further experiments are required to assess the role of the different NF- « B complexes identified and their interactions with other trans-acting factors in the induction of cytokine and receptor genes through activation of CD2 and CD28 .
These studies may provide new and important insights into the mechanisms of the adhesion molecule pathway involved in normal T-cell growth and differentiation .
Materials and Methods Primary T-Lymphocyte Preparation .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from healthy blood donors , and T-cells were purified as previously described ( 43 ) .
Controls for the absence of monocytic , B- , and natural killer cell contamination were performed by flow cytometry analysis using specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mAbs , namely 10G3.3 ( CD14 ) , 10B4 ( CD19 ; Immunotech , Marseille , France ) , and NKH1 ( Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) , respectively .
Contamination by B- or natural killer cells was less than 1 % .

( 59 ) as modified by Staal et al .
( 38 ) .
Briefly , cells were harvested and washed in cold Tris-buffered saline , then resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer A [ 10 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7.8-10 mm KCl-2 mm MgCl ; -1 mm dithiothreitol-0.1 mm EDTA-0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ] supplemented with leu-peptin ( 0.3 mg/ml ; Sigma ) , and incubated on ice for 15 min .
Then 25 gl of a 10 % Nonidet P-40 solution ( Sigma ) were added , and cells were vigorously mixed for 15 s and then centrifuged ( 13,000 rpm , 15 s ) .
Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 ul of buffer C [ 50 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7.8-50 mm KCIl-300 mm NaCl-0.1 mm EDTA-1 mm dithiothreitol-0.1 mm phenyImethylsulfonyl fluoride 10 % ( v/v ) glyc-erol ] .
After mixing for 20 min , the nuclei were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm , and supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were transferred to another tube and stored at -80°C .
