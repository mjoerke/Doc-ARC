6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; Inducible Nitric Oxide : An Autoregulatory Feedback Inhibitor of Vascular Inflammation ' Hai-Bing Peng , Martin Spiecker , and James K. Liao* Inducible nitric oxide ( INO ) is produced at sites of vascular inflammation by resident and nonresident vascular wall cells , but its role in the inflammatory process is not known .
In this study , we show that a novel function of iNO is to terminate inflammatory processes .
We find that iNO produced by murine macrophage-like cells , RAW264.7 , can inhibit cytokine-induced endothelial cell activation in a separated and mixed endothelial-RAW264.7 coculture system .
Both iNO production and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were induced simultaneously with bacterial LPS and murine-specific IFN-y .
Inhibition of iNO synthase ( iNOS ) activity with N ' in endothelial-RAW264.7 cocultures , stimulated with murine-specific IFN-y and LPS , decreased iNO production by 86 % , augmented VCAM-1 and iNOS expression in endothelial and RA W264.7 cells , respectively , and increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface .
Transient transfection studies using various VCAM-1 promoter constructs demonstrated that inhibitory effects of iNO on VCAM-1 gene transcription were mediated , in part , by inhibitory effects of iNO on xB cis-acting elements .
Immunofluorescence studies using an Ab to the RelA ( p65 ) subunit of nuclear factor-B revealed that iNO inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-xB .
These studies indicate that iNO attenuates iNOS expression in macrophages and inhibits monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells , and suggest that endogenously derived iNO may be an important autoregulatory inhibitor of vascular inflammation .
The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 1970-1976. ne of the proximal events in atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation is the activation of endothelial cells ( 1 ) .
The activated endothelium expresses surface adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 , and E-selectin , which facilitate the attachment of peripheral blood leukocytes to the endothelial cell surface ( 2 ) .
Indeed , leukocyte adhesion and infiltration to the vessel wall are crucial for initiating and sustaining the inflammatory process ( 3 ) .
Since the expression of VCAM-1 is up-regulated in response to cytokine stimulation during vascular inflammation , factors that can modulate endothelial VCAM-1 expression and subsequent leukocyte adhesion could potentially affect the inflammatory process .
During inflammatory conditions , vascular wall cells ( 4 , 5 ) and macrophages ( 6 , 7 ) produce sustained high levels of inducible nitric oxide ( INO ) via the induction of type II NO synthase ( iNOS ) .
Although the expression of iNOS is up-regulated in atherosclerosis ( 8 ) , transplant arteriosclerosis ( 9 ) , and balloon-injured vessels ( 10 , 11 ) , its precise role in these inflammatory processes is still poorly understood .

Indeed , inhibition of iNO production by a nonspecific NOS inhibitor , N-monomethyl-L-arginine ( LNMA ) , attenuates the inflammatory response associated with transplant rejection ( 13 ) .
Thus , under certain environmental conditions , iNO may function as a proinflammatory mediator .
In contrast , several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that NO may also function as an antiinflammatory mediator .
For example , the NO released by exogenous NO donors can decrease cytokine-induced endothelial cell activation ( 14 , 15 ) , inhibit endothelial-leukocyte interaction ( 16-18 ) , and attenuate vascular inflammation ( 19 ) .
It is uncertain , however , whether the NO donors used in these studies are biologically equivalent to endogenous derived 1NO produced at sites of vascular inflammation in vivo since the quantity and kinetics of NO release may differ ( 20-22 ) .
Furthermore , controversies exist as to whether some of the NO donors used in previous studies , such as S-nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) and 3-morpholino sydnonomine , actually release physiologic levels of NO or even NO at all ( 21 , 22 ) .
Although we have demonstrated previously that macrophage-derived iNO can inhibit endothelial VCAM-1 expression in a paracrine manner ( 23 ) , the relationship between iNO and vascular inflammation has not been clearly es-tablished .
The purpose of this study , therefore , is to determine whether endogenously derived iNO can regulate endothelial cell activation and endothelial-leukocyte interaction .

The rabbit polyclonal Re/A Ab were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Coculture system Two different coculture systems were used in this study .
The mixed coculture system consisted of human saphenous vein endothelial cells ( < 3 passages ) and adherent murine peritoneal monocyte-macrophage RAW264.7 cells grown on gelatin-coated six-well culture plates ( Nunc , Naperville , IL ) in DMEM containing 10 % FCS and 50 pg/ml of endothelial cell growth factor .
Each well contained equal number ( ~1.4 X 10° ) of endothelial and RAW264.7 cells .
For the separated coculture system , RAW264.7 cells ( ~1 X 10° cells ) were grown on six-well inserts ( Falcon , Franklin Lakes , NY ) placed above the underlying endothelial cells ( ~2 X 10° cells/well ) , but sharing the same culture medium , as previously described ( 23 ) .
Cellular viability , as determined by cell number , DNA con-tent , and trypan blue exclusion , was maintained for all treatment conditions .
Northern blot analyses The full-length cDNA probes for murine iNOS ( J. Cunningham , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , MA ) and human VCAM-1 ( T. Collins , Brigham and Women 's Hospital ) were radiolabeled using random hexamer priming ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) .
The membranes and the radiolabeled cDNA probes were hybridized overnight at 45°C in 50 % for-mamide , 5X SSC , 2.5 % Denhardt 's solution , 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 6.5 ) , 0.1 % SDS , and 250 ug/ml salmon sperm DNA , and washed with 0.2 % SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 65°C before autoradiography .
Nitrite assay Nitrite assay was performed using the Griess reagents , as described ( 23 ) .
In some instances , the media was removed and treated with nitrate reductase ( 10 mol/L to 1 mmol/L ) to convert all of the nitrate in the media to nitrite before addition of Griess reagents .
Preliminary studies indicate that the nitrite to nitrate ratio in all of our conditioned media is greater than 5:1 , indicating relatively little oxidation of nitrite to nitrate under our experimental conditions .
Monocyte adhesion assay Human PBMC were obtained from freshly prepared white blood cell-en-riched blood by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient at 15°C ( LMS ; Organon Teknika , Durham , NC ) , as previously described ( 14 ) .
Eluted monocyte suspensions with this technique are 89 + 4 % pure with 8 % lymphocyte , < 2 % granulocyte , and essentially no platelet contamina-tion , as determined by light scatter ( FACScan ; Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) and cell surface Ag analysis with mAb directed to CD14 .
For cellular adhesion assays , human saphenous vein endothelial cells were grown to confluency in six-well tissue culture plates ( ~2 X 10° cells/well ) and then placed in a separated coculture system with confluent RAW264.7 cells ( ~1 X 10° cells ) grown on overlying tissue culture inserts .
Following stimulation with the indicated agents , culture inserts containing RAW264.7 cells were removed , and the underlying endothelial cells were subjected to monocyte adhesion analyses .
The rotational monocyte adhesion assay was performed as described ( 14 ) .
The number of adherent cells was determined by counting four randomly selected high power fields using an ocular grid and a X20 objective ( 0.16 mm/field ) .
For nonspecific control , some monolayers were treated with murine mAbs , E1/6 and HUS5/3 , directed against VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 , respectively .
Enzyme-linked immunoassays Cells were incubated with VCAM-1 Ab ( E1/6 ) for 2 h. After rinsing with PBS , cells were incubated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG Ab ( 1/ 1000 dilution ; Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA ) for 1 h , followed by incubation with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase ( Zymed , South San Fran-cisco , CA ) for 30 min .
Cells were treated with p-nitrophenylphosphate ( 1 ug/tol ) for 30 min at 22°C , and absorbance was measured at 410 nm using cells without primary Ab as a blank .
Immunohistochemistry Endothelial cells in mixed coculture were grown on coverslips coated with 0.1 % gelatin in six-well Nunc culture dishes .
Following stimulation , cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde at 4°C for 10 min and incubated with VCAM-1 Ab ( E1/6 ) for 1 h. The plates were then incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse Ab ( Bio Genex , San Ramon , CA ) .
After further washing 1971 steps , the cells were incubated with a streptavidin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Ab and stained with Fast Red substrate ( Dako , Carpenteria , CA ) , followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin .
Immunofluorescence of NF-kB subunit RelA Cells were grown in the separated coculture system , as described ( 23 ) , except that RAW264.7 cells were prestimulated alone in six-well inserts with LPS/mIFN-y for 12 h before placing them in coculture with endothelial cells .
Following appropriate stimulation of coculture for 1 h , endothelial cells were fixed and permeabilized with acetone at -20°C for 2 min .
Cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal Ab directed against RelA ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; C20 , 1 ug/ml ! )
for 60 min , followed by incubation with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ab ( Vector ; IgG-H+L ) for 45 min .
After washing with PBS , cells were treated with streptavidin-FITC for 45 min .
Immunofluorescence was visualized using an Olympus BX 60F microscope ( Olympus ) .
Images for each condition were taken from four random fields and were representative of the entire field .
Transfection-CAT assays Several different VCAM-1 promoter constructs ( FO , F3 , and F4 ) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene were used for transient transfection assays ( 14 , 24 ) .
Bovine rather than human endothelial cells were used because of their higher transfectional efficiency by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method ( 12 % vs 1 % efficiency ) .
Twenty-four hours after transfection , equal number ( 8 X 10° cells ) of RAW264.7 cells were cocultured adjacent to transfected bovine endothelial cells .
The mixed coculture system was stimulated 48 h after transfection , as indicated .
To control for transfection efficiency , another reporter gene , CMV.B-gal , was cotransfected .
The relative CAT activity was calculated as the ratio of CAT to B-galactosidase activity and standardized to unstimulated FO promoter activity ( fold induction ) .
Data analysis All values are expressed as mean + SD compared with controls and among separate experiments .
Band intensities were quantitated by laser densitom-etry using the National Institutes of Health Image program ( 25 ) .
Paired and unpaired Student 's f tests were used to determine the significance of changes in absorbance values , nitrite levels , band intensities , and CAT activities .
p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant .
Results Induction of VCAM-1 and iNOS expression in single culture We find that mIFN-y has no biologic activity in human endothelial cells ( Le. , inability to activate IRF-1 or to induce endothelial MHC class II expression ) and alone was unable to induce iNOS mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells ( data not shown ) .
However , mIFN-y in combination with LPS significantly induced iNOS mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells alone after 24 h ( Fig .
14 ) .
LPS alone also induced iNOS mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells , albeit to a lesser extent compared with that of LPS and mIFN-y .
However , LPS alone did not induce iNOS mRNA expression in human endothelial cells .
Treatment with the LNMA alone had no effect on iNOS expression or function , but in combination with LPS and mIFN-y , decreased LPS/mIFN-y-stimulated iNO production by 86 + 5 % and augmented LPS/mIFN-y-induced iNOS expression by 2.5-fold ( p < 0.01 for both ) ( Fig .
14 and Table I ) .
These findings indicate that 1iNO produced by iNOS functions as an autoregulatory feedback inhibitor of macrophage iNOS expression .
Treatment with LPS alone or in combination with mIFN-y was equally effective in inducing VCAM-1 mRNA expression in human endothelial cells after 24 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
Treatment with LNMA alone mildly increased endothelial VCAM-1 expression ( 24 + 5 % of LPS stimulation , p < 0.01 ) , suggesting that basal endothelial NO production , although not detectable by the nitrite assay , contributed to the tonic inhibition of endothelial VCAM-1 expression ( Fig .
1B and Table I ) .
However , we have reported previously , using the more sensitive [ *HJarginine to conversion assay , that treatment with LNMA inhibited basal endothelial NOS activity by greater than 85 % ( 26 ) .

Effect of iNO on monocyte adhesion to endothelial cell surface in coculture Two coculture systems ( i.e. , mixed and separated ) were used to determine the paracrine effects of RAW264.7-derived iNO on endothelial cell activation .
When human endothelial cells were cultured with RAW264.7 cells in a separated coculture system , there was no basal iNO production and minimal monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface ( Table II ) .
Pretreatment of endothelial cells before monocyte adhesion assay with specific mAb to VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 indicates that these adhesion molecules contribute approximately 45 and 30 % toward monocyte attachment to LPS-stimulated endothelial cells , respectively .
Monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface was inversely proportional to the amount of iNO produced by RAW264.7 cells in the separated coculture system ( Table II ) .
Interestingly , treatment with LNMA had no detectable effects on NO production , but mildly increased monocyte adhesion , suggesting again that low constitutive endothelial NO production tonically inhibits endothelial-leukocyte interaction .

**Represents a significant change from LPS/mIFN-y stimulation in the presence of LNMA ( p < 0.05 ) .
Stimulation of the mixed coculture with LPS alone markedly induced VCAM-1 .
Addition of mIFN-y to LPS treatment resulted in the stimulation of iNO production ( 28 + 3.2 wmol/L ) and attenuation of VCAM-1 expression ( 31 + 3 % of LPS , p < 0.01 ) .
When LPS/mIFN-y-stimulated coculture was treated with LNMA , 1iNO production was reduced by 86 + 4 % , while VCAM-1 expression was augmented by 3.6-fold ( p < 0.01 for both ) .
Furthermore , the effects of LNMA on LPS/mIFN-y-stimulated VCAM-1 expression were nearly reversed in the presence of an NO donor , GSNO ( 43 + 4 % of LPS , p < 0.05 ) , confirming that 1NO is the most likely inhibitory mediator of endothelial VCAM-1 expression ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similar findings were observed in a mixed coculture system when RAW264.7 cells were grown adjacent to endothelial cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Effect of iNO on NF- « B activation in coculture Since the activation of NF- « B is required for VCAM-1 expression , we determined the effects of iNO on NF-KB activation in human endothelial cells .
Under basal conditions , the NF- « B subunit , RelA , is retained in the cytoplasm .
When cytokine-stimulated RAW264.7 cells producing iNO were incubated with unstimulated endothelial cells , iNO alone did not activate NF- « B in unstimulated endothelial cells ( data not shown ) .
In the separated coculture system , treatment with LNMA produced a small increase in NF-KB activation in endothelial cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
Stimulation with LPS alone caused a marked increase in the nuclear accumulation of RelA , which was inhibited by 1iNO produced in response to LPS and mIFN-y .
Addition of LNMA to LPS/mIFN-y-stimulated coculture inhibited iNO production by 85 % and led to an increase in NF-KB activation in endothelial cells .
Nitrite accumulation after 24 h in response to treatment with LNMA , LPS , LPS/mIFN-y , and LPS/mIFN-y/LNMA was 0.1 + 0.1 pmol/L , 5.2 + 1.3 pmol/L , 27.3 + 2.6 umol/L , and 4 + 0.2 mol/L , respectively .
Similar inhibitory effects of iNO on NF- « B activation in RAW264.7 cells were observed ( data not shown ) .

quires the activation of NF- « B ( 27 ) , the ability of iNO to inhibit NF- « B activation is consistent with our finding that inhibition of 1NO production by LNMA augments LPS/mIFN-y-induced iNOS expression ( Fig .
14 ) .
Effect of iNO on endothelial VCAM-1 gene transcription in coculture To confirm that « B cis-acting elements in the VCAM-1 promoter mediate inhibitory effects of iNO on VCAM-1 expression , we used several VCAM-1 promoter constructs ( FO , F3 , F4 ) linked to the CAT reporter gene ( Fig .
6A ) .
The [ -755-bpJFO construct is a fully functional VCAM-1 promoter containing activator protein-1 , GATA , two tandem « B , and IFN-stimulated response element cis-acting elements .
The [ -98-bpJF3 construct contains only binding sites for NF-kB and IRF-1 , while the [ -44-bpJF4 construct is devoid of « B cis-acting elements , but contains binding site for IRF-1 .
Transiently transfected bovine endothelial cells expressing various VCAM-1 constructs were cocultured adjacent to RAW264.7 cells .
Stimulation of the mixed coculture with LPS alone caused a 6.2-fold induction of FO promoter activity ( p < 0.01 ) ( Fig .
6B ) .
The combination of LPS and mIFN-y treatment , which stimulated 1NO production in RAW264.7 cells , completely repressed FO promoter activity to basal levels .
Addition of LNMA to LPS/mIFN-y-stimulated coculture caused a 7.4-fold increase in FO promoter activity ( p < 0.01 ) .
Similar findings were also observed with the 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 1974 FIGURE 5 .

The F4 construct , which lacks the two tandem B cis-acting elements , had a 4.2-fold lower basal promoter activity compared with that of FO construct .
The F4 construct was minimally induced by LPS and was not affected by iNO production .
These findings indicate that inhibition of VCAM-1 gene transcription by iNO is mediated predominantly by « B cis-acting elements .
Discussion We have shown that iNO can modulate macrophage and endothelial cell activation in an autocrine and paracrine manner , respectively .
Inhibition of endothelial cell activation by iNO resulted in a functional decrease in monocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cell surface .
This is consistent with our previous study showing that iNO can inhibit cytokine-induced endothelial VCAM-1 expression ( 23 ) .
Furthermore , inhibition of constitutive endothelial NO production by LNMA also induced low levels of endothelial cell activation and monocyte adhesion , indicating the importance of constitutive endothelial NO production in tonically suppressing basal endothelial cell activation .
The mechanism by which NO inhibits monocyte adhesion , in part , correlated with a reduction in endothelial NF-B activation and VCAM-1 gene tran INDUCIBLE NITRIC OXIDE AND ENDOTHELIAL CELL ACTIVATION - A -- A AP-1 GATA u s [ [ _ ] No Stimulation N= 3 I - » s LPS/mIFN-y LPS/mIFN-yLNMA x s 3 % doses -- + yam 0 S+ 3 s s 7 3 t =K 3 i 3 yey wa oe < hock xs 3 Hess 4 i Promoter Activity ( Fold Induction ) e % v is s a % % 3 f i 3 s a z de ats z % k T de dd x e e Siw F3.CAT Vector - SV40 FO.CAT F4.CAT FIGURE 6 .

B , VCAM-1 promoter activity ( fold induction ) , as assessed by CAT assays using transfected plasmid vectors containing no promoter ( vector ) , the SV40 pro-moter , and the indicated VCAM-1 promoter constructs .
Both RAW264.7 and transfected endothelial cells were stimulated in mixed coculture with LPS ( 10 ng/ml ) and mIFN-y ( 400 U/ml ) in the presence and absence of LNMA ( 3 mmol/L ) .
Each experiment was performed three times in trip-licate .
Results are presented as mean + SD .

scription .
These results are consistent with previous studies showing that NO decreases endothelial cell activation ( 14 , 15 ) .
Interestingly , iNO produced by RAW264.7 cells also attenuated its own NF-KB activation and iNOS expression in an autocrine manner .
This finding is also consistent with previous studies demonstrating that NO inhibits iNOS expression and activity ( 28-31 ) , and suggests that iNO may function as an important autoregulatory feedback inhibitor of vascular inflammation by not only limiting endothelial cell activation and monocyte attachment to the vessel wall , but also , inevitably , terminating its own production by inhibiting iNOS expression .
Our findings are consistent with recent in vivo studies suggesting that blocking iNO production may actually worsen transplant allograft arteriosclerosis ( 32 ) .
Although murine RAW264.7 cells may not represent human macrophages in terms of the quantity of iNO released , human vascular smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes , nevertheless , can produce sustained high levels of iNO in response to cytokines ( 33 ) .
Production of iNO by vascular smooth muscle cells may be more relevant than that produced by macrophages , given the ratio of smooth muscle to endothelial cells in the vascular wall .
The findings of our coculture system , therefore , most likely represent the physiologic colocalizing effects of cytokines , iNO , and endothelial cells within the vessel wall .
The RAW264.7 cells merely serve as an endogenous source of 1iNO in our studies .
6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology The results of the mixed coculture system may be influenced by potential heterotypic interactions between endothelial cells and RAW264.7 cells that may affect endothelial NF-KB activation and VCAM-1 expression .
For example , interaction between CD40 and CD40 ligand , which is expressed on macrophages and vascular wall cells , leads to the activation of NF- « B ( 34 ) .
However , heterotypic interactions in our mixed coculture system appear minimal since there was no NF- « B activation in either cell type under basal culture condition .
Furthermore , the inhibition of endothelial VCAM-1 expression by macrophage-derived iNO was reversed in the presence of LNMA , suggesting that the predominant inhibitory effect is due to endogenously derived iNO and not to heterotypic interactions in the mixed coculture system .
Most of the studies implicating NO as proinflammatory and cy-totoxic , however , are based upon association rather than causality ( 9 , 11 ) .
Nevertheless , some of the reported inconsistencies of the vascular effects of NO may be due to where NO is produced , the level of NO production , and the environmental milieu into which it is released .
Such factors can determine the ultimate biologic effects of NO by modulating its redox status ( 35 ) .
For example , iNO may function as a cytotoxic mediator through its ability to activate poly ( ADP-ribose ) synthetase ( 36 ) .
However , other neuro-toxic effects of iNO may be due to the interaction of NO with superoxide anion to form a potent oxidant , peroxynitrite ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , the interaction of 1iNO with thiol derivatives can lead to modification of intracellular proteins ( 35 ) .
Indeed , S-nitrosylation of p21 '' '' ( 37 ) and the transcription factor OxyR ( 38 ) by nitroso-thiols results in the activation of these signaling molecules .
Thus , it is likely that NO may mediate both pro- and antiinflammatory processes , depending on its interactions with local environmental factors .
The mechanism by which NO inhibits NF- « B occurs , in part , via the induction and nuclear translocation of the NF-B inhibitor , IkB-a ( 23 ) .
However , recent studies indicate that reactive oxygen species , particularly hydrogen peroxide , can activate NF-KB and proinflammatory genes such as macrophage CSF ( CSF-1 ) ( 39 ) .
Indeed , antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine or pyrrolidine di-thiocarbamate inhibit NF- « B activation and endothelial VCAM-1 expression ( 40 ) .
Thus , it is interesting to speculate whether NO and antioxidants share similar mechanisms in terms of suppressing reactive oxygen species production and inhibiting NF-KB .
For example , recent studies indicate that peroxynitrite formed by the interaction of NO and superoxide anion attenuates endothelial-leukocyte interactions ( 41 ) .
Conversely , NO , through its interaction with superoxide anion , may divert superoxide anion away from forming its dismutated product , hydrogen peroxide , thereby preventing peroxide-mediated activation of NF- « B .
This alternative mechanism agrees with previous studies showing that TNF- @ -in-duced VCAM-1 expression is inhibited by catalase , but not superoxide dismutase ( 14 ) .
Despite some similarities , some of the effects of NO and antioxidants on NF-KB activation are quite distinct .
For example , we have shown recently that antioxidants , but not NO , prevent IxB-a phosphorylation and degradation by inhibiting IxB-a « kinase activity ( 42 ) .
In contrast to cytokine-stimulated 1iNO , the NO derived from type III endothelial NOS is constitutively active and produces significantly lower levels of NO .
Endothelial derived NO has been shown to attenuate inflammatory processes by mediating vasodi-lation ( 43 ) , reducing platelet aggregation ( 44 ) , and inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation ( 45 ) .
Overexpression of endothelial NOS in the injured rat carotid artery attenuates intimal smooth muscle proliferation and vascular inflammation ( 46 ) .
Supplemen-tation of L-arginine , the precursor substrate for endothelial NOS , inhibits endothelial-leukocyte interaction and decreases the extent 1975 of atherosclerotic lesions in cholesterol-fed rabbits ( 47 , 48 ) .
Indeed , mutant mice that lack endothelial NOS develop larger cerebral infarct sizes in response to ischemia compared with wild-type mice ( 49 ) .
Thus , our results with iNO are consistent with the notion that NO in general is an important modulator of vascular inflammation .
Our findings , however , indicate that the amount of NO produced by endothelial NOS , although sufficient to tonically suppress basal endothelial cell activation , is not sufficient for inhibiting endothelial cell activation in response to cytokines .
It is interesting to speculate that perhaps inhibition of cytokine-induced endothelial cell activation is only possible when the vessel wall switches to the high capacity 1iNO during inflammatory conditions .
In summary , we have identified a novel physiologic mechanism by which iNO can modulate the activation of resident and nonresident vascular wall cells in an autocrine and paracrine manner .
Despite previous studies suggesting that iNO is a proinflammatory and cytotoxic mediator , our findings indicate that under certain conditions , iNO may be antiinflammatory through its inhibitory effects on NF-KB activation .
Since iNOS expression is up-regulated in inflammatory conditions , we propose that inducible NO may serve as an important inducible autoregulatory feedback inhibitor of vascular inflammation .
