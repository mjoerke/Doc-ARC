Orkin , April 30 , 2001 Friend of GATA ( FOG ) proteins regulate GATA factor-activated gene transcription .
During vertebrate hematopoiesis , FOG and GATA proteins cooperate to promote erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation .
The Drosophila FOG homologue U-shaped ( Ush ) is expressed similarly in the blood cell anlage during embryogenesis .
During hematopoiesis , the acute myeloid leukemia 1 homologue Lozenge and Glial cells missing are required for the production of crystal cells and plasmatocytes , respectively .
However , additional factors have been predicted to control crystal cell proliferation .
In this report , we show that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis and larval development , and the GATA factor Serpent is essential for Ush embryonic expression .
Furthermore , loss of ush function results in an overproduction of crystal cells , whereas forced expression of Ush reduces this cell population .
Murine FOG-1 and FOG-2 also can repress crystal cell production , but a mutant version of FOG-2 lacking a conserved motif that binds the corepressor C-terminal binding protein fails to affect the cell lineage .
The GATA factor Pannier ( Pnr ) is required for eye and heart development in Drosophila .
When Ush , FOG-1 , FOG-2 , or mutant FOG-2 is coexpressed with Pnr during these developmental pro-cesses , severe eye and heart phenotypes result , consistent with a conserved negative regulation of Pnr function .
These results indicate that the fly and mouse FOG proteins function similarly in three distinct cellular contexts in Drosophila , but may use different mechanisms to regulate genetic events in blood vs. cardial or eye cell lineages .
M embers of the GATA family of transcription factors regulate gene expression during the development of a variety of tissues ( reviewed in refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Functional studies of the GATA N-terminal zinc-finger domain have identified a class of interacting transcriptional coregulators , the Friend of GATA ( FOG ) family of multitype zinc-finger proteins ( 3-8 ) .
FOG modulation of GATA factor-regulated transcription entails repression or activation of gene expression , depending on the developmental context ( 3-11 ) .
Repression of GATA-1 transcriptional activation by FOG-1 can be mediated through a conserved PXDL amino acid motif , which binds the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein ( CtBP ) ( 11-13 ) .
The GATA-FOG regulatory paradigm extends across tissues and taxonomies .
In mice , two FOG genes with largely nonover-lapping expression patterns have been identified ( 6-8 ) .
FOG-1 interacts with GATA-1 during hematopoiesis to promote erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation ( 3 , 9 , 10 ) .
FOG-2 has been shown to repress GATA-4 activation of cardiac promoters in transient transfection assays and is required for cardiac morphogenesis and vascularization ( 7 , 8 , 14 , 15 ) .
In contrast , a single FOG gene has been identified in Xenopus and Drosophila .
The expression pattern of Xenopus FOG ( xFOG ) overlaps that of all six Xenopus GATA factors and , similar to murine FOG-1 , appears to regulate erythropoiesis ( 16 ) .

Ush is also expressed in hemocyte precursors during embryogenesis ( 17 ) .
These cells give rise to two classes of embryonic hemocytes , plasmatocytes and crystal cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
Plasmatocytes constitute 90-95 % of circulating hemocytes and are mac-rophage-like cells .
Crystal cells , named for their crystalline inclusions , are involved in the defense-related melanization of encapsulated targets ( 20 ) .
During hematopoiesis , the acute myeloid leukemia 1 ( AML-1 ) homologue Lozenge ( Lz ) and Glial cells missing ( Gem ) are required for the production of crystal cells and plasmatocytes , respectively ( 21 ) .
However , additional factors have been predicted to control crystal cell proliferation .
Considering that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and is structurally and functionally similar to FOG-1 and FOG-2 ( 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 22 , 23 ) , we wanted to determine its function during hematopoiesis .
In this report we show that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes and functions to limit crystal cell production .
Furthermore , this function may be conserved evolutionarily and require CtBP because misexpression of FOG-1 and FOG-2 repressed crystal cell production , whereas a mutant version of FOG-2 lacking the CtBP-binding motif did not .
This hematopoietic function of FOG proteins is in contrast to that of Lz and may represent an intersection between the FOG and AML-1 hematopoietic regulatory pathways .
To determine the extent of the functional conservation between the mouse and fly FOG family members , we also coexpressed Ush , FOG-1 , FOG-2 , or the mutant version of FOG-2 with Pur during heart and eye development .
We observed severe eye and heart phenotypes , consistent with a conserved negative regulation of Pur transcriptional activity .
These results indicate that Ush and the murine FOG proteins function similarly in three distinct cellular contexts during Drosophila development , but may use different mechanisms to regulate genetic events in blood vs. cardial or eye cell lineages .

Results Ush Expression During Hematopoiesis .
Using an antibody directed against Ush synthetic peptides , we detected Ush protein in an expression pattern similar to that previously reported for the gene transcript .
Around embryonic stage 8 , both ush RNA and protein can be detected in blood cell precursors ( ref .
17 ; Fig .
1a ) .
By stage 10 , Ush-positive hemocyte precursors have spread throughout the lateral and ventral head mesoderm ( Fig .

embryogenesis progressed , we detected Ush in stage 13 plasmatocytes migrating throughout the head mesoderm ( Fig .
1¢ ) and down the ventral midline .
During the late stages of embryogenesis , Ush continued to be expressed in plasmatocytes circulating throughout the embryonic hemolymph ( data not shown ) .
Iz expression in crystal cells is detected first during stage 10 and is maintained in this lineage until the late stages of embryogenesis ( 21 ) .
We used fluorescent antibody staining and confocal microscopy to determine whether Ush and /z were coexpressed in the crystal cell lineage .
To detect /z expression in hemocyte precursors and crystal cells , we monitored the expression of a UASlacZ reporter gene driven by IzGal4 ( zlacZ ) .
This reporter is active in hemocyte precursors as early as stage 10 and is expressed in the crystal cell lineage throughout embryogenesis ( 21 ) .
During embryonic stage 10 , a number of hemocyte precursors expressed both Ush and /z ( Fig .
104 ) .
Later , during stage 13 , the number of cells that expressed both /z and Ush decreased ( Fig .
le ) .
Finally , during the late stages of embryogenesis , Ush was not detected in crystal cell lineage , evidenced by its failure to colocalize with the IzlacZ crystal cell marker ( Fig .
1f ) .
These results are consistent with a role for ush as a repressor of crystal cell production and suggest that ush expression is down-regulated in hemocyte precursors during crystal cell lineage commitment .
During larval development , hematopoiesis takes place in the larval lymph glands , which flank the dorsal vessel .

- The epistaticrelationship between Ush and Srp .
Ush is detected in the hemocyte precursors ( hp ) of wild-type ( a and c ) but not srp mutant ( b and d ) embryos , whereas expression remains unaltered in the dorsal ectoderm ( de ) of both genotypes .
In contrast , the expression of Srp ( e-A ) is unaltered in ush mutant embryos ( fand h ) , compared with wild-type embryos ( e and g ) .

the gland , whereas crystal cells develop exclusively in the primary lobe ( 21 ) .
We detected Ush in most cells of primary and secondary lobes ( Fig .
1 g and / ) , consistent with expression in the plasmatocyte lineage .
The protein was expressed in a differential pattern in the cells of the lymph glands ( Fig .
1/7 ) , perhaps indicative of down-regulation during hemocyte precursor commitment .
This may be analogous to the down-regulation of murine FOG-1 that is required for eosinophil and myeloid lineage differentiation ( 3 , 28 ) .
Srp Is Required for Ush Hematopoietic Expression .
Srp function is required for hemocyte development and for differentiation of plasmatocytes and crystal cells ( 21 , 29 , 30 ) .
Furthermore , studies using amorphic alleles of srp indicate that it is required for hemocyte precursor specification ( 29 ) .
Srp is expressed first in the hemocyte precursors during embryonic stage 5 , and , similar to Ush , its expression is maintained in plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis ( 21 , 30 ) .
To determine whether an epistatic relationship exists between srp and ush , we assayed Ush expression in srp mutant embryos and Srp expression in ush mutant embryos ( Fig .
2 ) .
We used the hypomorphic allele srp , which results in the production of hemocyte precursors , even with the reduction of Srp function ( 30 ) .
In srp embryos , Ush was not detected in hemocyte precursors , plasmatocytes , or midgut ( Fig .
2 b and d ) , unlike the wild-type expression pattern ( Fig .
2 a and c ) .
In contrast , Srp was observed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes in both wild-type ( Fig .
2 e and g ) and ush mutant embryos ( Fig .
2 f and A ) .
This result suggests ush resides downstream of srp in the hematopoiesis hierarchy and ush expression requires Srp function .
Furthermore , ush is not required for the specification of hemocyte precursors or plasmatocytes , because these Srp-positive cells were detected in ush 7344 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.131215798 Fig .

mutant embryos .
Finally , wild-type levels of ush were present in the dorsal ectoderm of srp mutant embryos ( Fig .
2 b and d ) , indicating that dynamic ush expression is under the control of multiple regulators during embryogenesis .
Ush Functions to Prevent the Overproduction of Crystal Cells .
Previous studies have shown that ush functions to prevent the overproduction of sensory bristles , cardial cells , and pericardial cells ( 5 , 17 ) .
These observations , together with our findings that ush appeared to be down-regulated during crystal cell lineage commitment ( Fig .
1 ) , suggested that Ush may act to limit crystal cell production .
To test this hypothesis , we assayed for increased numbers of crystal cells in ush mutant embryos .
Crystal cells are localized in a bilateral cluster of cells within the head mesoderm and require /z expression from embryonic stage 10 through 14 for their development ( 21 ) .
The IzlacZ genotype served as a crystal cell marker .
Expression of IzlacZ was assayed in stage 13 embryos because during this stage the germ-band retraction phenotype can be used to distinguish ush mutant from wild-type embryos .
Homozygous ush embryos showed an increase in the number of IzlacZ-expressing cells ( Fig .
3 b and c ) compared with the wild-type control ( Fig .
3a ) .
We confirmed these results by using embryos harboring the Be mutation , which renders crystal cells visible in late-stage homozygous embryos ( 27 ) .
Crystal cell production in ush Bc embryos was compared with the Bc parental strain , which has the wild-type ush allele .
Again , homozygous ush Bc embryos had an increase in the number of crystal cells ( Fig .
3 e and f ) compared with the Be embryos from the parental strain ( Fig .
34 ) .
Because the number of crystal cells in wild-type embryo populations can vary more than 2-fold , we sampled 20 wild-type and 20 ush embryos and showed a 30 % overall increase in the number of crystal cells by using either the lzlacZ or Be marker .
These results indicate that Ush functions to repress crystal cell production during hematopoiesis .
Misexpression of FOG Transgenes Represses Crystal Cell Production .
To demonstrate further that Ush repressed crystal cell production , we expressed Ush in crystal cells by using the Gal4/UAS Fossett et al .

binary system ( 31 ) .
The IzGal4 driver was used to express UASUsh in crystal cells , and their production was monitored by using the IzlacZ marker .
Embryos with forced expression of Ush in crystal cells had a significant reduction in the number of these cells .
Compared with similarly staged wild-type controls ( Fig .
4 a and b ) , UASUsh stage 13 and 16 embryos ( Fig .
4 c and d ) had a 30 % and 85 % reduction in number of crystal cells , respectively .
A sample of 40 stage 13-16 UASUsh embryos averaged a 30 % reduction in the number of crystal cells compared with wild-type controls .
The phenotype of individual embryos within this population ranged from being completely devoid of crystal cells to wild-type cell numbers .
These results indicate that down-regulation of ush during crystal cell lineage commitment is required for development of these cells .
Together with the observed increase in crystal cell number in ush loss-of-function assays , these findings suggest that Ush functions during hematopoiesis to limit the number of hemocyte precursors that enter the crystal cell lineage .

Embryos are stained for D-MEF2 protein .
Forced pan mesodermal expression of FOG transgenes results in a reduced number of cardial cells in the forming dorsal vessel .
Arrows point to missing cardial cells .
Considering that Ush is structurally and functionally similar to murine FOG-1 and FOG-2 ( 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 22 , 23 ) , we wanted to determine whether expression of UASFOG-1 and UASFOG-2 would repress crystal cell production .
Forced expression of either of these proteins ( Fig .
4 reduced the average number of cells in stage 13-16 UASFOG-1 and UASFOG-2 embryos by 50 % overall compared with wild-type controls .
As with UASUsh , we observed a range of phenotypes from wild-type cell numbers to embryos completely devoid of crystal cells .
Approximately 23 % of the UASFOG-1 and UASFOG-2 embryos had no detectable crystal cells .
All members of the FOG family of proteins characterized to date have a consensus PXDL amino acid sequence , which binds to the transcriptional corepressor CtBP ( 11 , 16 ) .
Forced expression of a mutant form of FOG-2 with the CtBP interaction domain deleted ( UASAFOG-2 ) had no effect on crystal cell production ( Fig .
4 i and j ) .
Taken together , these data suggest that the mechanism of crystal cell repression by FOG class proteins is conserved and likely requires a corepressor such as CtBP .
FOG Transgenes Inhibit Cardial Cell Production .
In Drosophila , forced mesodermal expression of ush inhibits cardial cell production , presumably by negatively regulating Pur function ( 17 , 24 ) .
Given that FOG-1 and FOG-2 repress crystal cell production , we wanted to determine the effect of forced mesodermal expression of UASFOG-1 , UASFOG-2 , and UASAFOG-2 on cardial cell production .
The myogenic differentiation factor D-MEF2 was used to assess the status of cardial cells ( 32 ) .
Late-stage wild-type embryos have two contiguous rows of 52 cells present in the forming or mature dorsal vessel ( Fig .
5 @ ) .
In contrast , we observed a reduction in the number of cardial cells in embryos with iwiGal4-driven mesodermal expression of any one of the four FOG transgenes ( UASUsh , UASFOG-1 , UASFOG-2 , or UASAFOG-2 ; Fig .
5 b-e ) .
An average of 40 % of embryos had gaps in the heart tube ranging from 10 cells missing to a complete absence of cardial cells .
All four transgenes produced embryo populations with a similar range and severity of cardial cell reduction .

Arrows indicate ectopic production of antennae .
the FOG proteins in this heart-formation assay is conserved .
Furthermore , FOG proteins inhibit cardial cell production in the absence of the CtBP interaction domain , suggesting either that this corepressor is not required or that different corepressors operate in the cardial cell and hemocyte lineages .
FOG Transgenes Perturb Eye Development .
Pur is also expressed at the dorsal margin of the eye imaginal disk and acts upstream of wingless to control proper eye and head capsule development ( 33 ) .
In the wild-type adult , the ommatidia have a distinct polarity and there is a single pair of antennae ( Fig .
6a ) .
eyGal4-driven expression of any one of the four FOG transgenes in the eye disk produces phenotypes comparable to those observed in pnr mutants ( 33 ) .
These phenotypes include ectopic production of antennae ( Fig .
64 ) , reduction or loss of the eye ( Fig .
6 b-e ) , disrupted ommatidial polarity , and death of ~80 % of the population before eclosion .
These results are similar to those observed in animals with pnrGal¥4-driven misexpression of Ush ( 33 ) .
Our observations suggest that forced expression of FOG proteins in the eye disk inhibits the function of Pur and that this perturbation of eye development does not require interaction with a protein that binds the PXDL sequence .
7346 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.131215798 Discussion In this report we have shown that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis and during larval development .
Srp acts upstream of Ush during hematopoiesis , and Srp-positive plasmatocytes were observed in ush mutant embryos , indicating that Ush is not required for plasmatocyte specification and migration .
Nonetheless , the observation that Ush is expressed in the plasmatocyte lineage suggests it is required for some aspect of plasmatocyte development .
Ush is down-regulated during crystal cell lineage com-mitment , consistent with a role for the protein as a negative regulator of crystal cell production .
Genetic studies demonstrated further that Ush limits crystal cell production and that this function may be conserved evolutionarily among the FOG proteins .
Moreover , repression of crystal cell production by FOG proteins appears to require CtBP .
In contrast , forced expression of the FOG factors repressed cardial cell production and disrupted eye development in the absence of the binding site for this transcriptional corepressor .
Lebestky et al .
( 21 ) recently reported that Srp acts upstream of two lineage-specific transcription factors , Gem and Lz .
In this model of Drosophila hematopoiesis , Srp-positive hemocyte precursors give rise to a large subpopulation of Gem-positive cells ( plasmatocyte lineage ) and a smaller subpopulation of Lz-positive cells ( crystal cell lineage ) .
These authors reported that misexpression of Gem in crystal cells can change their fate to that of the plasmatocyte lineage .
However , they also reported that /z expression did not change , nor did the number of crystal cells increase , in gem loss-of-function mutants ( 21 ) .
This result indicates that other factors are required to restrict the number of hemocyte precursors that enter crystal cell lineage commitment .
Crystal cell numbers increased in ush mutant embryos and decreased in embryos with /z enhancer-directed misexpression of Ush .
Thus , Ush may function to restrict the size of the crystal cell population by regulating crystal cell lineage commitment .
Recent studies have indicated that FOG proteins may function to regulate the commitment of several hematopoietic lineages .
Ectopic expression of FOG proteins mFOG-1 , mFOG-2 , and xFOG ( Xenopus FOG ) early in Xenopus development represses red blood cell formation , possibly by down-regulating Gata-/ expression ( 16 ) .
These data suggest that FOG proteins may act to limit the differentiation of erythrocytes to prevent depletion of pluripotent stem cells ( 16 ) .
Furthermore , by using an in vitro avian hematopoietic differentiation system , Querfurth et al .
( 28 ) demonstrated that FOG-1 represses eosinophil-specific gene expression and that forced expression of FOG-1 in eosinophils produces a multipotent precursor phenotype .
Thus , down-regulation of FOG-1 in multipotent hematopoietic precursors is an essential step in eosinophil differentiation ( 28 ) .
In addition to our findings that misexpressed Ush repressed crystal cell production , our data showing FOG-1 and FOG-2 also repressed crystal cell number indicate that the mechanism by which these proteins limit crystal cell number may be conserved .
Taken together , studies using the Drosophila and vertebrate systems suggest that FOG proteins function to preserve the multipotent hemocyte precursor pool by controlling the lineage commitment of specific cell types .
An additional factor that may be required to control lineage commitment is CtBP .
This transcriptional corepressor may interact with FOG-1 and FOG-2 to repress erythrocyte differ-entiation , because a mutant version of FOG-2 lacking the consensus PXDL sequence failed to repress erythrocyte differentiation when ectopically expressed during Xenopus development ( 16 ) .
We have shown that CtBP may be required for FOG protein repression of crystal cell production .
It is noteworthy that CtBP likely functions during Drosophila hematopoiesis because a lacZ reporter gene inserted in the enhancer region of the CtBP Fossett et al .
gene is expressed in the larval plasmatocyte lineage ( 34 ) .
Thus , the FOG and CtBP class of transcriptional regulators may act together to control hemocyte lineage commitment in a pathway that is conserved evolutionarily .
FOG function involves binding to its GATA partner 's N-terminal zinc finger .
Srp is the only known hematopoietic GATA factor in Drosophila and reportedly contains a single C-terminal zinc finger ( 29 ) .
However , a survey of the srp genomic sequence shows an ORF within the third intron of the gene that putatively encodes an N-terminal zinc finger with 96 % homology to that of Pur ( data not shown ) .
This raises the possibility that Ush interacts with an alternatively spliced isoform of Srp during hematopoiesis .
Ush appears to negatively regulate the cardiogenic function of the GATA-4 homologue Pur ( 17 , 24 ) , converting Pur from a transcriptional activator to a repressor as observed during sensory bristle development ( 5 , 35 ) .
As with Ush , forced mesodermal expression of FOG-1 , FOG-2 , and AFOG-2 also produced a diminution of cardial cells .
These results demonstrate a functional conservation of the FOG proteins during Drosophila cardiogenesis , which most likely involves negative regulation of the cardiogenic activity of Pur .
In addition , forced expression of FOG proteins disrupted eye development-producing phenotypes that mimic pnr loss of function mutants , presumably by repressing Pur activation of its downstream effector genes .
The disruption of eye development and the repression of cardial cell production by FOG proteins occurred in the absence of the CtBP-binding motif .
This is consistent with the work of Svensson et al .
( 36 ) , which showed that FOG-1 and FOG-2 .

repression of GATA-4 activation of cardiac promoters did not require the corepressor CtBP .
Rather , conserved N-terminal regions of the murine FOG proteins were required for the repression of GATA-4 transcriptional activation , indicating that an alternative repressor mechanism may be used to negatively regulate GATA-4 ( 36 ) .
An emerging hypothesis suggests that CtBP may be a hematopoietic corepressor , and an alternative corepressor may be required during heart development .
Our results showing that AFOG-2 does not repress crystal cell production but does repress cardial cell production is evidence for this dual mechanism of FOG gene regulation during heart development and hematopoiesis in a single experimental organism .
In conclusion , our data suggest that Ush and Lz function antagonistically during crystal cell lineage commitment and that Ush is required to limit the overproliferation of crystal cells .
This demonstrates a possible intersection between the FOG and AML-1 gene pathways , which may prove important for understanding vertebrate hematopoiesis .
Furthermore , this study expands the molecular characterization of the earliest events of hematopoiesis in Drosophila , identifying additional conserved genes that establish the fly as a model organism for hematopoiesis .
