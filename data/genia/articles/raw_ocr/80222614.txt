] , France ABSTRACT In leukocyte populations freshly isolated from the blood of 26 patients with acute leukemia , we have measured several parameters including glucocorticoid receptors , nucleoside incorporation , percentage of cells in S phase , and steroid-induced cell lysis .
In addition , in some cases , the short-term response to steroid therapy was determined .
Although , in all the patients studied , leukocytes were found to contain glucocorticoid receptors , we failed to demonstrate any correlation between the level of binding sites and the in vitro or in vivo response to glucocorticoids .
This absence of correlation could be in part explained by the marked heterogeneity of the steroid response demonstrated in leukocyte subpopulations .
It appears , however , that the degree of steroid action in vitro as well as the extent of spontaneous and dexamethasone-induced cell death may be related to the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle .
INTRODUCTION It is now widely accepted that ALL ' is a heterogeneous disease with regard to its clinical aspects , its response to chemotherapy , and its prognosis ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 12 , 41 , 47 ) .
It has been shown that the clinical heterogeneity of ALL appears in part to be related to the extent of lymphocyte differentiation , a high proportion of cases arising from bone marrow-derived `` null '' cells and the rest from cells differentiating into mature T- and B-cells .
More recently , these 3 main groups have been subdivided according to the level of leukemic cell differentiation , based on the study of constitutive enzymes and other biochemical markers .
This immunological classification is of practical value , since correlations have been demonstrated between the phenotype of the leukemic cells and the prognosis of the disease .
Because of the well-known catabolic effects of glucocorticoids on lymphoid tissue ( 9 , 36 ) , glucocorticoids have been used for more than 20 years in the treatment of leukemia , first alone and now as a part of combined chemotherapy ( 3 , 4 , 31 ) .
It appears , however , that some patients are resistant to steroid treatment or cease to respond over the course of the treatment .
Because of the iatrogenic complications of steroid treatment , it would be of value if one could select in advance those patients who are likely to respond to glucocorticoids .
According to the classical mechanism of steroid hormone action , which includes a preliminary step of interaction of the steroid with cytoplasmic receptors ( 16 ) , numerous studies have * The abbreviations used are : ALL , acute lymphocytic leukemia ; BSA , bovine serum albumin ; HBSS , Hanks ' balanced salt solution ; GIBCO , Grand Island Biological Co .

JULY 1980 been devoted to the question of whether or not the receptor content of leukemic cells is representative of their in vitro or in vivo steroid sensitivity and would therefore be indicative of therapy ( 5 , 11 , 14 , 23 , 24 , 28 , 30-33 , 46 ) .
The situation , however , remains unclear .
Lippman et al .
( 30 ) first presented evidence in favor of such a correlation between cytosolic receptor content and in vitro sensitivity in patients with ALL .
Sibley and Tomkins ( 44 ) and Lippman et al .
( 32 ) later described the existence of corticoresistant lymphoma or lymphoblastoid cell lines which contained glucocorticoid receptors .
Furthermore , Bird et al .
( 5 ) , as well as Crabtree et al .
( 11 ) , Homo et al .
( 24 ) , and Sioman and Bell ( 45 ) failed to demonstrate any significant correlation between the number of steroid receptors and the in vitro sensitivity of human lymphoblastoid cell lines or human leukemic cells .
In this study , we have measured in 26 patients with acute leukemia not only the level of glucocorticoid receptor and later steps in the steroid action ( i.e. , inhibition of nucleic acid precursors and cell lysis ) but also several parameters of population diversity ( immunological markers , morphology , pulse cytophotometric analysis ) on the whole-leukocyte populations or in subpopulations isolated by centrifugation on a discontinued BSA gradient .
In some cases , we have also attempted to relate these parameters to the short-term in vivo response to glucocorticoid therapy .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients .
Studies were performed in 26 patients with acute leukemia , comprising 24 patients with ALL and 2 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia in `` lymphoid '' blast crisis .
In each of the patients studied , cytological examinations were performed .
Blood and bone marrow were stained by different methods including May-Griuinwald-Giemsa , periodic acid-Schiff , peroxidase , and also , in numerous cases , by an acid phosphatase reagent .
Detection of T-cells was performed by the erythrocyte rosette-forming test using sheep erythrocytes and by the trypan blue dye exclusion test with a rabbit anti-human T-lymphocyte antiserum ( Merieux Institute ) and detection of B-cells by immunofluorescence of surface immunoglob-ulins .
None of these patients had ever received chemotherapy prior to the time of the study .
All experiments were performed at the time of the first examination .
The clinical features of the patients are presented in Table 1 .
Isolation of Cells .
Leukocytes were isolated within 2 hr after blood sampling by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque ( 6 ) .
After 2 washes using HBSS , the cells were resuspended in minimum essential medium ( Gibco Ref .
138 ) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine ( Gibco Ref .
503 ) , 1 mm sodium pyruvate ( Gibco Ref .
136 ) , penicillin ( 100 units/ml ) , and streptomycin ( 100 ug/ml ) ( Gibco Ref .
507 ) and 1 % ( v/v ) of nonessential amino acid 2601 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

solution ( Gibco Ref .
114 ) ( Medium A ) and adjusted to a concentration of 10 '' cells/ml .
The cell viability , estimated by the trypan blue exclusion procedure ( 37 ) , was always above 95 % at the end of the cell isolation procedure .
In one patient ( S. S. , Patient 10 ) , the experiment was performed on a bone marrow sample ; the marrow was successively aspirated through 18- , 22- , and 25-gauge needles to obtain a single-cell suspension which was diluted in HBSS and then centrifuged on Ficoll-Hypaque .
Isolation of Cell Subpopulations .
The separation of cell subpopulations by centrifugation on a discontinuous BSA gradient was performed according to the method described by Komuro and Boyse ( 27 ) .
Leukocytes ( 2 to 4 x 10° cells ) prepared as described above were resuspended in 1 ml of 35 % BSA solution and deposited at the bottom of 1- x 10-cm tubes .
One ml of the following BSA solutions were then layered successively on this suspension : 29 % , 26 % , 23 % , and 10 % .
After 30 min centrifugation at 13,000 x g ( 4° ) , the cells located at the 4 interfaces were collected and washed twice with 5 ml HBSS .
The cells were then resuspended in Medium A , counted , and assayed for °H-nucleoside incorporation , cell viability , pulse cytophotometric analysis , and May-Griinwald-Giemsa staining .
A-cells are those located at the top of the gradient between the 23 and 10 % BSA layers , B-cells are located between 26 and 23 % BSA layers , C-cells are located between 29 and 26 % BSA layers , and D-cells are located between the 35 and 29 % BSA layers .
In each experiment , the 4 samples A , B , C , and D were adjusted to the same concentration , 1 to 3 X 10° cells/ ml .
As previously demonstrated , this procedure of gradient separation does not significantly alter the metabolic properties of the cells ( 13 , 22 ) .
Binding Assays .
[ °H ] JDexamethasone was used as tracer because , unlike endogenous cortisol , it has low affinity for the plasma cortisol-binding globulin .
The methodology of [ °H } dexamethasone binding studies has been previously described ( 13 , 15 ) .
In each experiment , the cells were incubated either with alone ( 24 to 25 Ci/mmol , The Radi-ochemical Centre , Amersham , U.K. ) or in the presence of an excess of unlabeled dexamethasone .
The residual binding in the presence of nonradioactive steroid was assumed to represent nonspecific binding and the difference between the total binding of [ °HJdexamethasone , and this nonspecific binding was taken as specific binding of the steroid hormone .
Steroid Effect on Nucleic Acid Precursor Incorporation .
In order to determine the steroid sensitivity of the cells in vitro , we measured the incorporation of tritiated nucleosides in the absence ( control ) or presence of nonradioactive dexamethasone .
Previous experiments performed using normal human lymphocytes or leukemic cells showed that short-term incubation ( 3 to 5 hr ) in the presence of steroid does not lead to any marked decrease in precursor incorporation ( 24 , 25 ) .
There-fore , the cell suspensions were preincubated for 22 hr at 37° in an atmosphere of 5 % CO ; in air , in the absence or presence of 107° m dexamethasone , and then received 1 of either [ } HJuridine ( 25 Ci/mmol ! )
or [ °HJthymidine ( 27 Ci/mmol ; CEA France ) for a 2-hr pulse labeling .
The reaction was terminated by addition of ice-cold 5 % trichloroacetic acid .
The precipitates were filtered on Whatman GF/A filters and washed 3 times with 10 ml of ice-cold 5 % trichloroacetic acid .
The radioactivity collected on the filters was counted by liquid scintillation spec-trometry .

At the end of the incubation , the cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml propidium iodide solution ( 50 mg propidium iodide and 1 g sodium citrate per liter ) .
Pulse cytophotometric measurements were performed within 1 hr of staining using a Cytofluorograf ( 4802 A ; Biophysic Sys-tems , Inc. , Mahopac , N .

DNA histograms were evaluated by planimetry ( 20 ) .
Statistical Analysis .
Correlations were estimated by determination of the regression lines using the least square method .
RESULTS Determination of Glucocorticoid Receptors in Acute Leukemia .
Chart 1 ( right ) shows the values of glucocorticoid-binding sites , determined by Scatchard plot analysis ( 40 ) , in 23 patients .
The concentration of glucocorticoid receptors varied widely from one patient to another , ranging from 2,600 to 19,200 sites per cell . '
The mean receptor value was about 9000 sites [ 9140 + 4390 ( S.D .
) ; n = 23 ] per cell .
Dissociation constants , determined from the slope of the Scatchard plots , were in the range of 1.2 to 6.7 x 10~° m ( 3.9 + 1.6 x 10~° m ; n = 23 ) and appeared similar to those determined for dexamethasone-re-ceptor interaction in normal human lymphocytes ( Chart 1 , /eft ) .
Attempts have been made to correlate the level of steroid receptors with several parameters including immunological markers , WBC , and patients ' sex or age .
The results presented in Table 2 reveal that the number of glucocorticoid receptors tends to be higher in males than in females .
Konior-Yarbro et al .
( 28 ) also mentioned some variation in the level of glucocorticoid receptors with sex and age , but their results were not statistically significant .
This possible sex difference in receptor level should therefore be confirmed in more extensive studies .
Within our group of patients , no significant difference in receptor content between T-cell and `` null '' cell acute leukemia was 10 20000 ® - U aE bnd @ s x & x R « a [ 3 * * = ] f=3 e w to € s- m 8 410000 R 3 % Se = mex 00g 2 = ma H F a I § & O 2 o 6 « a U co e Chart 1 .

apparent , in contrast with previously reported results ( 28 ) .
These discrepancies might be related to differences in methodology as discussed elsewhere ( 14 ) .
Absence of Correlation between the Effects of Glucocorticoid in Vitro and the Levels of Glucocorticoid Receptors .
Attempts have been made to establish a correlation between the level of glucocorticoid receptors and the inhibitory effects of steroids on uridine and thymidine incorporation in vitro .
As shown in Chart 2 , no correlation could be found between the number of steroid-binding sites and the percentage of steroid-induced inhibition of both uridine and thymidine incorporations .
Moreover , in some patients , we have even noted a stimulation of nucleoside incorporation in the presence of dexamethasone .
In addition , the sex difference observed in terms of glucocorticoid receptors is not associated with any sex difference in steroid sensitivity .
Dexamethasone-induced inhibition of uridine and thymidine incorporation is plotted as a function of the spontaneous levels of nucleoside incorporation Chart 3 .
A significant correlation exists between these parameters ( r = 0.49 , p < 0.01 , n = 25 and r = 0.51 , p < 0.01 , n = 25 for uridine and thymidine , respectively ) , suggesting that the effects of the steroid in vitro could be linked to the proliferative and metabolic state of the cells .
The effect of dexamethasone on cell viability , which represents the end point of the steroid action , was also determined over a 22-hr incubation period in vitro , in relation to receptor levels .
As shown in Chart 4 , in the absence of steroid , the cell viability remained > 75 % in 15 of 23 patients and showed only an appreciable decrease in 8 of 23 patients .
Dexamethasone ( 10~ '' m ) produced a supplementary diminution of cell viability in only 7 of 23 patients .
This effect was more frequent in those patients who showed an already high incidence of spontaneous cell death ( 5 of 8 ) .
Under similar conditions , the viability of normal human peripheral Iymphocytes remained virtually unaffected by steroid ( 25 ) .
Again , no correlation could be found between the lytic effect of steroid in vitro and the number of glucocorticoid receptors .

Dexamethasone on [ °HJThymidine Incorporation .
As mentioned above , there is a significant correlation between the level of [ °HIthymidine incorporation and the extent of the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone .
In order to focus on this relationship , we have divided our patients into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of cells in S phase , determined by pulse cytophotometry .
As shown in Table 3 , the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on thymidine incorporation is markedly higher in the group possessing an appreciable proportion of cells in S phase than in the group with no detectable circulating cells in S phase .
No difference could be seen between male and female patients in terms of the proportion of cells in the S phase and steroid inhibition , although the number of binding sites appears to be higher in male than in female patients .
In addition , the mean value of WBC is consistently but not significantly lower in patients with no cells in S phase than in patients with an appreciable proportion of these cells .
Relationship between the Proportion of Cells in the S Phase and Spontaneous or Dexamethasone-induced Cell Lysis .
As shown in Table 4 , there is a parallelism between the 2604 pattern of cell viability and the proportion of cells in the S phase .
This percentage tends to be higher in the group of patients whose cells exhibit spontaneous cell death than in the group of patients with no cell death ( 5.4 + 3.5 versus 3.8 + 4.8 % ) .
Moreover , within the group showing steroid-induced aggravation of cell death , the porportion of cells in S phase appears still higher ( 7 + 3.7 % ) .
The incidence of patients showing an appreciable percentage of cells in S phase is 6 of 13 in the group with a spontaneous viability of > 75 % , 7 of 8 in the group with a spontaneous viability of < 75 % , and 7 of 7 in the group showing steroid-induced cell lysis .
As also shown in Table 4 , the WBC tends to be lower in the group of patients with a cell viability of > 75 % than in the 2 other groups .
Absence of Relationship between the Proportion of Cells in the S Phase of the Cell Cycle ( Measured at the Time of Blood Sampling ) and the Level of [ °HJThymidine incorporation after 24 Hr Incubation in Vitro .
Analysis of the results presented above revealed that some patients with a high percentage of ceils in the S phase , when measured at the time of blood sampling ( which represents the time zero of the experi-ment ) , do not necessarily exhibit a high level of thymidine incorporation as measured by a 2-hr pulse labeling after 22 hr incubation in vitro .
Thus , each of the 2 groups of patients previously classified according to the presence or absence of cells in S phase could be further subdivided into 2 groups .
Among the patients with a high percentage of cells in S phase at the time of blood sampling , Group III contains the patients whose cells showed a high level of [ °HJthymidine incorporation after 24 hr incubation , whereas Group IV contains the patients with a low [ °HIthymidine incorporation .
Patients with no appreciable proportion of cells in S phase and low levels of thymidine incorporation are separated into 2 groups , I and II , according to the pattern of cell viability .
in Group II , the percentage of viable cells remained over 75 % in the absence as well as in the presence of 10~® m dexamethasone ; whereas in Group I , the percentage of viable cells is lower than 75 % .
As shown in Chart 5 , both nucleoside incorporations and the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone increase in parallel from Group I to Group III and then decrease in Group IV , which still confirms the correlation between the levels of nucleoside incorporation and the extent of steroid action .
The pattern of cell viability appears highly variable in Groups III and IV , whether or not it is affected by the steroid in vitro .

patients showing clinical characteristics generally considered as indicative of a poor prognosis : 2 patients over 15 years of age with `` null '' cell leukemia ; 2 adult patients with T-cell leukemia ; and 2 patients ages around 50 years with chronic myelocytic leukemia in `` lymphoid '' blast crisis .
This group is also characterized in general by a high WBC and a male predominancy .
Cell Heterogeneity .
Tables 5 and 6 show several parameters ( distribution , viability , proportion of cells in S phase , levels of [ ®HIthymidine incorporation , and inhibitory effects of steroid in vitro ) determined in 4 patients after isolation of subpopulations by centrifugation on a discontinuous BSA gradient .
From the results obtained after gradient separation , several points may be underlined : ( a ) the cell distribution along the gradient appears markedly different from one patient to another , even in the 2 patients with similar clinical and immunological features ( Table 5 , Patients B. J. M. and G. G. ) .
in general , the vast majority of cells are located in the lightest fractions of the gradient ( A and B ) ; ( b ) in a given patient , the subpopulations appear markedly different in terms of spontaneous or dexamethasone-induced cell lysis ( Table 5 ) ; ( c ) similarly , the level of [ °HIthymidine incorporation varies markedly from one subpopulation to another both between patients and JULY 1980 within a given patient ( Table 6 ) .
The upper layer of the gradient ( Subfraction A ) appears , however , enriched in proliferative blast cell as determined by thymidine incorporation , pulse cytophotometry analysis , and also smear examination in good agreement with previously published results ( 10 , 38 , 43 ) ; ( d ) the percentage of steroid-induced inhibition of thymidine incorporation is generally maximal in the light fraction ( Subfraction A ) , but this high inhibitory effect does not appear to be necessarily associated with steroid-induced cell lysis .
Thymidine incorporation is sometimes slightly stimulated by dexamethasone in the dense fractions ( Subfractions C and D ) .
In some cases , granulocytes or monocytes could be observed in these fractions by smear examinations .
Response to Short-Term Glucocorticoid Therapy .
Eleven patients were treated with prednisone ( 40 mg/sq m ) for 2 to 4 days before starting combined chemotherapy .
Among these patients , only 6 responded to steroids by a marked decrease both in WBC and in the level of circulating blast cells .
The clinical features and the results of in vitro determinations in responding and nonresponding patients are compared in Table 7 .
No significant differences could be found between these 2 groups in terms of glucocorticoid receptors or in terms of inhibition of nucleoside incorporation by dexamethasone and 2605 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

DISCUSSION The proliferative activity of leukemic cells in acute leukemia has been under investigation for a long time .
In former autora-diographic observations and determinations of the mitotic index or , more recently , pulse cytophotometry analysis , low percentages of bone marrow cells in S and G ; + M phases have been found in untreated ALL patients ( 19 , 21 , 26 , 35 ) .
Except for some patients with ALL , there exist in all types of acute leukemia more cells in the S phase of the cell cycle in the bone marrow than in peripheral blood ( 19 , 35 ) .
Under normal conditions , very few proliferating cells enter the circulation ; while in acute leukemia , bone marrow blasts generally escape into the peripheral blood .
In some ALL patients , however , the dominant migration may be in the opposite direction .
Small diurnal variations in the number of cells synthesizing DNA were also seen in the bone marrow of some patients , as well as a periodicity in the appearance of labeled cells in the peripheral blood after thymidine injection in vivo , suggesting that some control mechanism for bone marrow release is at work ( 19 , 39 ) .
Several investigators have emphasized that , in a given patient , blasts can not be considered as a single homogeneous population and that a classification could be achieved on the Table 5 Distribution and patterns of viability in subfractions isolated by centrifugation on a discontinuous BSA gradient Arrows denote a dexamethasone-induced decrease of cell viability after 22 hr incubation in the presence of 10~° m steroid .

basis of morphological criteria and labeling index ( 19 , 26 , 35 ) .
It has been suggested that , during the maturation process of leukemic blasts , some cells proliferate while others do not and cells may die at any stage of their development ( 26 , 48 ) .
The question as to the kind of cells which are preferentially released from bone marrow is still open .
More recently , Wagner et a/ .
( 48 , 49 ) pointed out that each of the various types of ALL ( `` 'null , '' ' T-cell-derived , and B-cell-derived ALL ) does not represent a uniform type of neoplasia with an identical growth pattern .
Considering all the factors of heterogeneity which exist in ALL , it is not surprising to find no correlation between in vivo and in vitro effects of glucocorticoids .
Using both freshly isolated cells and a whole-cell binding assay to minimize technical problems , we failed to show any relationship between the level of steroid receptors in lymphoid cells and the in vitro actions of glucocorticoid , the clinical features of the patients investigated , or the in vivo response .
The only significant correlation found with regard to the steroid effects in vitro was the relationship between uridine and thymidine incorporation in ALL and the steroid-induced inhibition of their incorporation .
This suggests , as previously reviewed ( 2 , 9 ) , that the effects of glucocorticoids on lymphoid cells greatly depend upon the state of the cell at the time of drug exposure .
We therefore conclude that steroid receptor determinations in human circulating leukemic cells are not sufficient to preclude steroid sensitivity .
Using pulse cytophotometry analysis and density gradient centrifugation , we have demonstrated that in blood samples of ALL the pattern of proliferative activity is highly variable and that a marked cell heterogeneity exists in a given patient and between different patients with the same clinical features .
Furthermore , we have shown that the degree of steroid action in vitro may be related to the number of cells in S phase as well as the extent of spontaneous cell death and dexamethasone-induced cell death .
It should be mentioned that , for experimental convenience , most of the experiments performed in order to determine the effects of glucocorticoids on leukemic cells in vitro were with WBC instead of bone marrow cells .
However , it has been shown that peripheral blood cells do not entirely reflect the proliferative activity of the bone marrow ( 20 , 35 ) .
Hillen et a/ .
JULY 1980 ( 21 ) , using pulse cytophotometry analysis , have investigated the short-term and long-term effects of prednisone treatment on blood and bone marrow cells of ALL patients .
They found a considerable decrease in S phase and G , + M cell in bone marrow of the patients after 3 days of treatment , while bone marrow morphology ( percentage of blasts ) remained almost unchanged .
In most patients , this effect was accompanied by a rapid decline in the number of lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood .
After 1 or 2 weeks of daily prednisone treatment , they found an increase in the proportion of bone marrow cells in the S and G ; + M phases in all patients , while the percentage of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow diminished and the normal hemopoietic cells reappeared .
They suggested that glucocorticoids cause a selective lysis of lymphoblasts , independent of the cell cycle , while the development of normal hemopoiesis is not disturbed .
This is in agreement with the rapid disappearance of mainly nonproliferating lymphoblasts from the peripheral blood during prednisone treatment demonstrated by Ernst and Killmann ( 17 ) .
They also suggested that , beside the lytic effect , prednisone may also have an effect on the mitotic cycle which could explain the decreased percentages of cells in the S and G + M phases during the first days of treatment .
Such inhibition of the passage of lymphoblasts from G , to S has already been demonstrated ( 17 , 29 ) .
Bone marrow cells may represent a more appropriate tissue for the study of glucocorticoid action , and comparison with blood cells would be of great interest .
Depending on the nature of the leukemic cells , the effects of glucocorticoids in vitro may differ , inhibiting DNA synthesis in a given population of blasts without affecting their viability and inducing cell lysis or accelerating programmed cell death in another population ( 34 , 42 ) .
Finally , there are a number of additional problems which have not been mentioned , such as the effects of glucocorticoids on leukocyte and vascular function and on the general hormonal balance to which tumors are exposed ( 5 ) .
Such in vivo perturbations induced by glucocorticoids could influence the evolution of leukemia .
Indeed , it has been demonstrated recently that the effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocytes are more indirect ( suppressing the production of T-cell growth factor by some cells ) than direct ( at the level of the activated lymphocytes ) ( 18 ) .
Furthermore , the experimental in vitro con 2607 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

ditions do not correspond to the in vivo situation .
In vivo , the steroid could not only affect the lymphoid tissue directly but also disturb the ionic and/or hormonal hemopoietic microen-vironment .
in vitro studies would therefore not encompass these possible synergistic-antagonistic factors of steroid action .
