Immunology 1998 94 167-172 Low CD3 + CD28-induced interleukin-2 production correlates with decreased reactive oxygen intermediate formation in neonatal T cells S. KILPINEN & M. HURME Department of Microbiology and Immunology , University of Tampere Medical School , Tampere , Finland SUMMARY The capacity of neonatal T cells to secrete interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) has been reported to be variable .
We analysed IL-2 production in purified neonatal and adult T cells using polyclonal activator phorbol ester + calcium ionophore ( PDBu + iono ) or receptor-mediated anti-CD3/anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation .
PDBu+iono induced equally high IL-2 levels in both groups and , when stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , the IL-2 secretion by neonatal cells was undetectable and adult cells produced low amounts of IL-2 ( mean 331 +86 pg/ml ) .
The addition of anti-CD28 mAb to anti-CD3-stimulated cells markedly increased IL-2 production in both cell types , but levels of IL-2 in neonatal T cells remained clearly lower than those of adult T cells ( respective mean values : 385 +109 pg/ml and 4494 +1199 pg/ml ) .
As NF-xB is a critical transcription factor in the control of IL-2 expression , we next analysed its nuclear translocation in neonatal and adult T cells using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and , because induction of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) is required for the activation of NF-xB , we also analysed levels of intracellular ROI in these cells using the ROI-reactive fluorochrome DCFH-DA and flow cytometry .
In neonatal T cells NF- « B activation and ROI formation after anti-CD3 stimulation were low compared with adult T cells and , although addition of anti-CD28 mAb increased induction of NF- « B and ROI formation , levels similar to those of adults were not achieved .
After PDBu+iono stimulation , the cells showed similar ROI formation and IL-2 secretion .
Our results suggest that reduced IL-2 production by neonatal T cells is specific for anti-CD3 and anti-CD3 + anti-CD28-mediated stimulation and that these activators can not effectively activate the ROI-NF-xB signalling pathway in neonatal T cells .
INTRODUCTION Neonatal T cells may be considered as naive on the basis of their origin , their phenotype and their functional properties .
Tedder et al . '
originally made the observation that greater than 90 % of human neonatal T cells are of the CD45RA * surface phenotype , whereas only about 60 % of circulating adult T cells are of this phenotype .
It is thought that these CD4SRA * T cells are virgin , antigenically unprimed cells that evolve into CD4SRO* T cells - memory cells - presumably as a result of repeated antigen exposure .
* '' The cytokine profile of neonatal T cells is unique and it has been reported that neonatal T cells produce less interferon-y ( IFN-y ) , IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor- « ( TNF-4 « ) than adult T cells in response to various stimuli .
** Conflicting results have been found with regard to IL-2 production by neonatal cells : increased , normal or reduced IL-2 secretion have all been Received 23 October 1997 ; revised 26 February 1998 ; accepted 28 February 1998 .

`` ~ '' This discrepancy may at least partially be caused by differences in experimental procedures and/or differences in stimulating agents .
Most of the studies have been carried out using polyclonal activators and , in response to them , IL-2 production by neonatal T cells has been shown to be comparable with IL-2 production by adult T cells .
However , a few studies using more specific stimuli , like antigens or monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) against the CD3/T-cell receptor ( TCR ) complex and the CD2 molecule , have reported a reduction in the level of IL-2 secretion by neonatal T cells .
`` * '' Optimal activation of T cells results in increased production of IL-2 , enhanced cell proliferation and an effective immune response . '' ''
To become optimally activated , T cells require co-stimulatory signals in addition to the signal provided via the CD3/TCR complex .
The CD28 molecule appears to be an important co-stimulatory receptor on T cells and addition of anti-CD28 mAb to T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/TCR mAb enhanced T-cell proliferation , primarily as a result of increased IL-2 synthesis . ''
Signalling through CD28 leads to activation and binding of the transcription factor NF- « B to the CD28 responsive element ( CD28RE ) in the IL-2 pro-moter . ''
NF-xB has a central role in T-cell activation and is 168 S. Kilpinen & M. Hurme a key regulator of IL-2 gene expression .
A great variety of stimuli can regulate its activation .
'* Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) are not only undesirable side-products of mitochondrial respiration or part of an antimicrobial defence mechanism but may also be involved in signal transduction of immunoregulatory processes . '' ''
A number of studies further suggest that ROI , for example superoxide , hydrogen peroxide and lipoxygenase products , could participate in lymphocyte activation ; basically all inducers of NF-xB , such as viral and bacterial products , T-cell mitogens , co-stimulation with anti-CD28 mAb and inflammatory cytokines , induce a transient formation of ROI ; furthermore , NF- « xB activation is inhibited by a broad range of chemically unrelated antioxidants .
'* ' '' The precise role of ROI in signal transduction pathways is still unknown , but it is thought that these could directly modify the function of transcription factors or could act as second messengers , to regulate the activity of protein kinases or phosphatases . ''
To study in detail the molecular mechanisms that regulate the IL-2 production of neonatal T cells , we stimulated these cells either polyclonally , using the phorbol ester and calcium ionophore ( PDBu+iono ) combination , which bypasses the cell surface receptors , or 'physiologically ' using anti-CD3 +anti-CD28 stimulation .
The data obtained demonstrated that after PDBu +iono stimulation , neonatal and adult T cells produced equally high levels of IL-2 but , after anti-CD3 +anti-CD28 stimulation , IL-2 levels were much lower in neonatal T-cell cultures .
Analysis of the signalling mechanisms indicated that in neonatal T cells anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation induced a weaker NF-xB DNA binding and lower levels of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) than in adult T cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents OKT3 ( anti-CD3 ) antibody-containing ascites fluid was provided by Dr M. Kaartinen ( Department of Bacteriology and Immunology , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland ) .
In some experiments OKT3 ( anti-CD3 mAb ) from Pharmingen ( Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) was also used at a final concentration of 1 ug/ml .
Monoclonal antibody of the mouse subclass immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) against human CD28 ( clone CLB-CD28/1 15E8 ) was purchased from the Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion service ( CLB , Amsterdam , the Netherlands ) .
Phorbol dibutyrate ( PDBu ) was obtained from Sigma ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) and the calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) was from Calbiochem ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) .
The purity of the cells was controlled by flow cytometry and the following antibody conjugates were used : IgG1-fluorescein isothiocyan-ate ( FITC ) and IgG2a-phycoerythrin ( PE ) as isotype controls and Leucogate ( CD45/CD14 ) ( Becton-Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
The culture medium consisted of RPMI-1640 ( Gibco , Paisley , UK ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( Gibco ) , 10 mm Hepes buffer , 2 mm L-gluta-mine and antibiotics ( complete medium ) .
Cell preparation Cord blood was collected from the umbilical veins of healthy , full-term newborns after normal vaginal delivery ( kindly performed by the staff of the Department of Obstetrics , Tampere University Hospital , Finland ) .
Leucocyte-rich buffy coats were obtained from healthy adult blood donors ( Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service , Tampere , Finland ) .
Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Isopaque ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) density centrifugation .
After washing , most of the adherent cells were removed by plastic plate adherence for 60 min at 37° .
T cells were enriched by rosetting with S- ( 2-aminoethyl ) isothiouroniumbromide-treated _ sheep _ red blood cells .
The purity of the cells was determined by flow cytometry .
The cells were cultured in petri dishes at a concentration of 10° cells/ml in complete medium and stimulated .
IL-2 production Microtitre wells were coated with a pretested optimal dilution of anti-CD3 antibody-containing ascites fluid .
The wells were incubated at 37° for 1 hr and then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) before Tcells were added ( 250 x 103/well ) .
Anti-CD28 mAb , PDBu and calcium ionophore were added directly to the wells .
Anti-CD28 mAb was used at a final concentration of 2 ug/ml ; PDBu and calcium ionophore were used at final concentrations of 100 ng/ml .
After 24 hr the cells were harvested and the supernatants were collected and stored at -20° .
IL-2 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ; Duoset , Genzyme Diagnostics , Cambridge , UK ) .
The sensitivity of the assay was 15:6 pg/ml .
Measurement of intracellular ROI 2 '' 7-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate ( DCFH-DA ) ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) is a stable non-fluorescent cell-diffusible dye , which has been used as indicator for the intracellular formation of H , O ; and free radicals . ''
Intracellular esterases cleave the acetyl groups from the molecule to produce non-fluorescent 2 ' 7'-dichlorofluorescin .
This is trapped inside the cell and , in the presence of ROI , 27-dichlorofluorescin is further modified to fluorescent 27-dichlorofluorescin , which can be detected by flow cytometry .
Cells were preloaded with 5 um DCFH-DA at 37° for 15 min in PBS and were then stimulated using plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb , anti-CD28 mAb or PDBu the stimulator concentrations used are listed above .
The assay was performed as described'® and 10000 individual data points were collected for each sample with a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer .
The data were expressed as mean level of fluorescence ( FL1 ) .
The mean fluorescence of unstimulated samples was subtracted from that of stimulated samples at each time point .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) The NF- « xB oligonucleotide used ( 5-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3 ' ) was purchased from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .
To measure the association of NF- « B with xB sequence , the double-stranded oligonucleotide described above was end-labelled with **P. Nuclear extracts were isolated from 10x 10° cells and prepared as described previously . ''
Nuclear protein-DNA-binding reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 ul containing 5 ug nuclear extract protein , 10 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 7-5 ) , 40 mm KCl , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm dithio-threitol , 10 % glycerol , 2 mg poly dI-dC ( Pharmacia ) as a non-specific competitor and 10 fmol 5'-labelled double-stranded oligonucleotide .
The binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min .
Samples were then analysed ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 94 , 167-172 Correlation of CD3 + CD28-induced IL-2 production with ROI 169 by electrophoresis on 4 % non-denaturing low-ionic-strength polyacrylamide gels in 0-25 x TBE ( 22 mm Tris , 22 mm boric acid , 0:5 mm EDTA ) and detected by autoradiography .
Autoradiograms - were quantified using a - Personal Densitometer SI ( Molecular Dynamics Inc. , CA ) .
Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the for independent samples .
RESULTS Effect of anti-CD3 + anti-CD2 $ 8 stimulation on IL-2 production When stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb , the production of IL-2 by neonatal T cells was undetectable and , although adult T cells produced only low amounts of IL-2 ( mean 331 +86 pg/ml ) , their IL-2 secretion was significantly higher than that of neonatal T cells .
It has been well documented that in T cells activated via their CD3/TCR , the addition of anti-CD28 mAb causes a marked increase in the IL-2 mRNA level and of IL-2 secretion . ''
Stimulation of cells with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 mAb increased IL-2 production compared to cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb alone .
After anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation , IL-2 secretion by adult cells ( mean 4494 +1199 pg/ml ) was significantly greater than IL-2 secretion by neonatal cells ( 385 +109 pg/ml ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
Anti-CD28 mAb was normally used at 2 ug/ml .
In some experiments anti-CD28 mAb was added in graded amounts ; the co-stimulatory effect of anti-CD28 mAb on IL-2 production remained the same at concentrations of 20 ug/ml to 0-7 ug/ml .
When anti-CD28 mAb was used at a concentration of 0:2 ug/ml , it no longer had any co-stimulatory effect on IL-2 secretion .
PDBu was a potent stimulator of IL-2 production and induced a similar level of IL-2 production in neonatal ( mean 157-6+300ng/ml ) and adult ( mean 135-3 +17-5 ng/ml ) T cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
With this activator there was no significant difference between the groups .

cells or cells stimulated with anti-CD28 mAb alone showed no IL-2 production .
Effect of anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation on NF-xB activation NF- « B is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of the IL-2 gene .
* ' Previous reports have shown that the IL-2 gene promoter has a CD28-responsive element ( CD28RE ) * and , after CD28 co-stimulation , this region contains at least three members of the NF- « B family . '' ''
Based on these results , levels of NF-KB in nuclear extracts of T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 mAb for 24 hr were examined .
Fig .

Unstimulated cells ( Fig .
3 , lanes 1 and 4 ) or cells treated with anti-CD28 mAb alone ( data not shown ) showed no or low levels of NF-xB .
Anti-CD3 stimulation induced an increase of NF- « xB activation , which was greatly enhanced when anti-CD28 mAb was added as a co-stimulus to the cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
In neonatal T cells , NF-xB induction in response to anti-CD3 stimulation was low compared with adult T cells ( Fig .
3 lane 5 versus lane 2 , respective densitometric values 7 and 1160 ) .
Although addition of anti-CD28 mAb to neonatal cells increased NF-KB levels , they were not restored to the levels observed in adults ( Fig .
3 , lane 6 versus lane 3 , respective densitometric values 894 and 2039 ) .
Effect of anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation on ROI formation It has been shown that the co-stimulatory CD28 pathway leads to the generation of ROI '' and that ROI are important regulators of NF-xB activation . ''
In both groups , anti-CD3 +anti-CD28 stimulation clearly induced stronger ROI production than anti-CD3 stimulation alone ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , adult cells always produced higher levels of ROI than neonatal cells , both with anti-CD3 and with anti-CD3 +anti-CD28 stimulation ( Fig .

As it was previously observed that ligation of CD28 causes the rapid decrease of glutathione within minutes and increases ROI formation , which is maintained for 16-24 hr after stimula-tion , '' '' it was surprising in our experiments that the ROI levels started to decrease so soon after cell stimulation ( Figs 900 { -a- PDBu+iono/adult T cells soo } -*- PDBu+iono/cord T cells 700 | 600 } 500 } 400 F Mean fluorescence 300 f 200 | 100 F 0 T T u t T 15 30 45 60 75 Time ( min ) Figure 5 .

This phenomenon may partly result from properties of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescindiacetate ( DCF-DA ) .
Intracellular oxidation of DCF-DA tends to be accompanied by leakage of the end product ( 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein ) from the cell , which may make detection of slow oxidation difficult . '' ''
DISCUSSION Previous studies have observed a reduced IL-2 production and proliferation after anti-CD3 stimulation in murine neonatal T cells* and our results are consistent with these studies .
It has also been found previously that anti-CD3-stimulated neonatal T cells of mice greatly increased their IL-2 production in response to anti-CD28 mAb '' and we noted the same phenomenon in human neonatal T cells .
Our data also suggest that the decreased IL-2 secretion of neonatal cells is specific for CD3 and CD3 +CD28-mediated stimulation ; direct stimulation with PDBu+iono induced equally high IL-2 levels .
The lower reactivity of neonatal T cells could not be explained by different expression of these surface molecules on the cells .
We found the surface expression of CD3 and CD28 to be similar both in adult and neonatal T cells : 98 % CD3 in adults , 98 % CD3 in newborns ; and 74 % CD28 in adults , 77 % CD28 in newborns ( data not shown ) , thus being consistent with previous reports .
`` * '' ° To clarify the molecular background of reduced IL-2 secretion by neonates after receptor-mediated stimulation we analysed activation of NF-xB and ROI formation in these cells .
NF- « B is an important inducible regulator of the IL-2 gene and several studies have suggested that ROI are a common messenger required for NF-xB activation , although the exact activation mechanism is still unknown .
** We observed that NF-xB activation and ROI formation of the cells were parallel with their IL-2 production .
In neonatal T cells , NF-xB activation and ROI formation in response to anti-CD3 stimulation were low compared with adult T cells , and although ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 94 , 167-172 Correlation of CD3 + CD28-induced IL-2 production with ROI 171 addition of anti-CD28 mAb increased induction of NF- « B and ROI formation , levels similar to those of adults were not achieved .
After stimulation with PDBu+iono , cells showed similar ROI formation and IL-2 secretion .
We have reported previously that cord T cells stimulated for 24 hr with PDBu+iono had even stronger NF-xB activation than adult T cells . ''
It is well known that NF- « B is not the only transcription factor involved in IL-2 production by T cells .
Transcription factors such as NF-AT , AP-1 , Oct-1 and AP-3 also regulate IL-2 transcription , and the co-operation of these factors is required for complete T-cell activation . '' '
Based on present data , two of these factors - AP-1 and NF-xB - are regulated by the intracellular redox state . '' ''
As oxidative stress has been shown to perturb intracellular Ca** homeostasis , '' it remains possible that ROI may modify more than just these two transcription factors .
In our present study we concentrated on transcription factor NF-xB , because it is an oxidative stress-responsive factor and previous data have shown that signalling through CD28 increased NF-xB activation but significantly inhibited AP-1 activation . ''
We found decreased NF- « B activation after anti-CD3 and anti-CD3 +anti-CD28 stimulation in neonatal T cells , but we can not exclude the possibility that some other transcription factors involved in IL-2 transcription after this stimulation would also be decreased in these cells .
Our present results suggest that the reduced IL-2 production by neonatal T cells could result from decreased ROI formation after anti-CD3 and anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation .
ROI can act as signal transducers by modifying , directly or indirectly , different protein kinases or phosphatases , which then activate NF-xB .
`` ° Reduced levels of ROI formation by neonatal T cells was specific for stimulation via CD3 and CD28 receptors .
It has been observed that the activity and expression of p56 '' * and p59 '' , protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family , are lower in cord T cells compared with adult T cells .
`` * The function of these kinases is essential for efficient signalling through TCR , '' and it has been proposed that p56 '' and/or p59° '' could also participate in signalling through the CD28 molecule ( reviewed in reference 37 ) .
Furthermore , these protein tyrosine kinases have been found to be redox sensitive . '' ''
Thus , it may be hypothesized that the reduced activity and expression of these kinases in neonatal T cells could account for the reduced ROI formation and NF- « B activation observed after anti-CD3 and anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation .
In conclusion , our results suggest that reduced IL-2 production by neonatal T cells is a result of decreased ROI formation , and thus decreased NF-xB activation .
Neonatal T cells are 'true ' naive cells , which have not previously encountered antigen , and their activation leads to the initiation of a cell cycle from a 'true ' resting state .
Various groups have shown that naive T cells have a higher activation threshold for the CD3/TCR signal than memory T cells '' '' and optimal CD28 co-stimulation can not compensate for this difference . ''
Together with these earlier reports , our findings suggest that neonatal and adult T cells have , at least partly , different activation requirements and intrinsic properties and thus it is possible that neonatal T cells are at a different stage of development and differentiation .
Studies even exist which have found the function of phenotypically similar , CD4*CD4SRA * , adult and neonatal T cells to be different ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 94 , 167-172 and which suggest that the neonatal CD4*CD4SRA * T cell is a precursor of the adult CD4*CD4SRA * T cell .
*** '' Recent studies in our laboratory support the notion that the functions of neonatal T cells differ from those of adult naive T cells ; after anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation CD4SRA*t and CD4S5RO * T cells of adults produced equally high IL-2 levels , and induction of NF-xB activation and ROI formation were stronger in naive than in memory T cells of adults .
