LEONARD* Laboratory of Molecular Immunology , National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892-1674 Received 19 August 1996/Returned for modification 11 October 1996/Accepted 8 April 1997 The interleukin-2 IL-2 receptor B-chain ( IL-2R $ ) is an essential component of the receptors for IL-2 and IL-15 .
Although IL-2Rf is constitutively expressed by lymphocytes , its expression can be further induced by a number of stimuli , including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) .
We have now characterized factors that bind to an enhancer region located between nucleotides -170 and -139 of the human IL-2RfB promoter .
Both Sp1 and Sp3 bound to the 5 ' portion of this region , whereas a PMA-inducible factor ( PIF ) mainly bound to its 3 ' portion and bound to the Sp binding motifs as well .
In Jurkat T cells , induction of PIF DNA binding activity was rapidly induced , required de novo protein synthesis , and was sustained at a high level for at least 23 h. Interestingly , PIF was constitutively activated in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed MT-2 cells .
In this paper , we demonstrate that PIF is Egr-1 based on its recognition by anti-Egr-1 antisera in gel mobility shift assays , even though the IL-2RB DNA binding motif differed substantially from the canonical Egr-1 binding site .
In addition , Egr-1 bound to the Sp binding site .
In Jurkat cells , both sites were required for maximal IL-2RfB promoter activity , and in HeLaS3 cells , transfection of Egr-1 could drive activity of a reporter construct containing both sites .
Moreover , Spl and Egr-1 could form a complex with kinetics that correlated with the production of Egr-1 in Jurkat cells upon PMA stimulation .
Thus , Spl and Egr-1 physically and Vol .

7 functionally cooperate to mediate maximal IL-2RB promoter activity .
The interleukin-2 receptor B-chain ( IL-ZRB ) is a critical signaling component of high- and intermediate-affinity IL-2Rs ( 28 , 42 , 47 ) .
Like the common cytokine y chain , IL-2R $ is also a component of the receptor for IL-15 , a cytokine that shares a number of biological actions with IL-2 ( 3 , 17 ) .
Recent evidence derived from gene-targeting experiments has shown that mice deficient in IL-2RB exhibit dysregulated T-cell activation and autoimmunity , indicating that IL-2RB plays vital roles in maintaining normal immune responses ( 45 ) .
IL-2Rf is constitutively expressed in resting T cells ( 12 , 37 ) , B cells ( 4 , 37 , 52 ) , natural killer ( NK ) cells ( 38 ) , monocytes ( 14 , 37 ) , dendritic epidermal cells ( 46 ) , neutrophils ( 11 , 50 ) , and large granular lymphocyte-like cells in decidua during early pregnancy ( 40 ) .
Stimulation of T cells with a number of stimuli can greatly increase the levels of both IL-ZRB mRNA and protein ; such stimuli include the mitogen phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( 20 ) ; anti-CD3 ( unpublished observations ) , anti-CD28 , ( 7 ) , and anti-CD2 plus anti-CD28 ( 7 ) antibodies ; the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA [ un-published observations ] ) ; IL-2 ( reference 38 and unpublished observations ) ; and IL-4 ( 6 ) .
However , the molecular mechanisms by which the IL-2RB gene expression is regulated are not well understood .
We previously delineated the regions critical for basal and PMA-inducible activities of the human IL-2RB promoter and identified three enhancer-like regions .
Among them , the -56 to -34 and -170 to -139 enhancer regions were active in T-cell lines but not in nonlymphoid HeLaS3 or MG63 cells , correlating with the activity of the IL-ZRB promoter in these cells .
The -56 to -34 enhancer contains an Ets * Corresponding author .

3714 binding site ( EBS ) that binds two Ets family proteins , Ets-1 and GA-binding protein ( GABP ) .
Although the integrity of this site is critical for both enhancer and promoter activities ( 30 ) , the EBS in the -56 to -34 region is not sufficient for IL-Z2RB promoter activity , since a 5'-deletion reporter construct containing nucleotides -61 to +97 is not active .
Therefore , like many other cellular promoters ( 31 , 48 ) , the IL-2RB promoter appears to be coordinately regulated by multiple elements .
Egr-1 ( early growth response protein 1 ) cDNA was first isolated as an immediate-early gene by differential screening of cDNA libraries made from BALB/c 3T3 cells stimulated by serum in the presence of cycloheximide ( 27 , 43 ) .
In addition to its induction by mitogens , Egr-1 is induced by other stimuli , including signals for development , differentiation , tissue or radiation injury , and neuronal excitation ( 15 ) .
Egr-1 has been shown to be a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that binds to the 5'-GCG ( C/G ) GGGCG-3 ' motif ( 8 ) .
Like Sp family proteins , Egr-1 also contains Zn finger structures ( 9 , 43 ) that are critical for its DNA binding activity ( 5 ) .
Depending upon the presence of other DNA binding sites nearby the Egr-1 site , it can cither positively or negatively regulate gene transcription in response to stimulation , because Egr-1 contains both transactivation and repression domains ( 16 ) .
We have now characterized the -170 to -139 enhancer region of the human IL-ZRB promoter and found that Spl , Sp3 , and Egr-1 bind to this region .
We also demonstrate that both Sp and Egr-1 binding sites at the -170 to -139 enhancer region are required for maximal IL-2RB promoter activity .

Transient transfection and CAT assays .
Jurkat cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran ( Pharmacia ) as described previously ( 30 ) .
For IL-2RB enhancer and promoter constructs , 5 and 10 pg , respectively , of plasmid DNA purified with Qiagen plasmid purification kits ( Qiagen Inc. , Chatsworth , Calif. ) were used .
HeLaS3 cells were seeded in 100-mm-diameter petri dishes , transfected with 5 pg each of reporter and effector plasmid DNAs with Lipofectamine reagent ( Gibco-BRL , Gaithersburg , Md .
) , and maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 0.5 % fetal bovine serum .
Twenty-four hours after transfection , the cells either were not treated ( controls ) or were treated with 10 ng of PMA ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo . )
per ml .
The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection , and protein concentrations were determined with the Protein Assay Reagent ( Bio-Rad ) .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays ( 18 ) were performed with equal amounts of protein extracts .
For enhancer and promoter constructs , the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 and 3 h , respectively .
CAT activities were quantitated by analyzing the thin-layer chro-matography plates ( J. T. Baker Inc. , Phillipsburg , N.J. ) with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
EMSA and methylation interference assay .

The concentrations of nuclear proteins were quantitated with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent .
Ten micrograms of nuclear extracts and 15,000 cpm of *°P-labeled probes were used in each reaction mixture as previously described ( 30 ) .
For competition assays , nuclear extracts were preincubated for 20 min with 25 ng of unlabeled oligonucleotide as indicated , radiolabeled probe was added , and then the mixture was incubated for another 15 min .
For supershift assays , prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe , the nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice for 30 min with 2 pl of antibody as indicated .
For methylation interference assays , probes *°P end labeled at either the top or bottom strands were prepared as described previously ( 30 ) .
Typically , 500,000 cpm of probes and 30 pg of nuclear extracts were used in each binding reaction mixture .
Methylation interference assays were performed according to the method of Baldwin ( 2 ) .
Southwestern assay , immunoprecipitation , and western blotting .
For Southwestern assays , 30 ug of nuclear extracts was denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 7.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate gels .
After proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes ( Millipore Corporation , Bedford , Mass .
) , the blots were incubated in blocking buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 60 mM KCI , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 5 % nonfat dry milk ) at 4°C for 1 h and then incubated at 4°C for 1 h in binding buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 60 mM KCI , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 5 pg of salmon sperm DNA per m ! )
containing 400,000 cpm of *°P-labeled oligonucleotides per ml .
The blots were then washed in washing buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 60 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT ) at room temperature for 30 min , and the results were visualized by autoradiography .
For immunoprecipitation and Western blotting , 10 X 10° to 20 x 10° cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris ( pH 7.0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mM 4- ( 2-aminoeth-y ) benzenesulfonyl fluoride ] at 4°C for 30 min .
The immunocomplexes were precipitated with 5 pg of anti-Sp1 antiserum and recombinant protein G-agarose ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , Md .
) , resolved on 8 % poly-acrylamide gels ( Novex , San Diego , Calif. ) , and blotted onto Immobilon-P mem-branes .
The membranes were then blotted with anti-Egr-1 or anti-Sp1 antiserum and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL System ; Amersham ) .
In some of the immunoprecipitation experiments , prior to addition of anti-serum , lysates were incubated with or without ethidium bromide on ice for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min to remove DNA contamination from the total cell lysate ( 26 ) .

EMSAs of nuclear proteins binding to -170 to -139 , -170 to -155 , and -158 to -142 oligonucleotides .
( A ) Radiolabeled -170 to -139 probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or HeLaS3 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) cells either untreated ( lanes 1 and 3 ) or treated with 10 ng of PMA per ml for 1 h ( Jurkat ) or 5 h ( HeLaS3 ) .
( B ) Prior to addition of the radiolabeled -170 to -139 probe , the nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either untreated ( lane 1 ) or treated with PMA ( lanes 2 to 7 ) were incubated either with no competitor ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or with 25 ng of the following unlabeled competitors : -56 to -34 ( lane 3 ) , -170 to -139 ( lane 4 ) , -170 to -155 ( lane 5 ) , -158 to -142 ( lane 6 ) , and SV40 Sp1 ( lane 7 ) .
( C ) Radiolabeled -170 to -139 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , -158 to -142 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , -170 to -155 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , and SV40 Sp1 probes were incubated with the nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either untreated ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ) or treated with 10 ng of PMA per ml for 1 h ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) .
( D ) Radiolabeled -170 to -139 ( lane 5 ) , -170 to -155 ( lane 6 ) , -158 to -142 ( lane 7 ) , and SV40 Sp1 ( lane 8 ) probes were incubated with 0.5 footprinting unit of purified human Spl protein ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
( E ) The nuclear extracts were preincubated with either unrelated antibody ( lane 1 ) or anti-Sp1 ( lane 2 ) , anti-Sp2 ( lane 3 ) , anti-Sp3 ( lane 4 ) , or anti-Sp4 ( lane 5 ) antibody prior to addition of radiolabeled -170 to -155 probe .
The supershifted complex by anti-Sp1 antibody is indicated by an asterisk .
RESULTS Spl , Sp3 , and PIF bind to the -170 to -139 enhancer region .
To identify nuclear proteins that could bind to the -170 to -139 enhancer region , we performed EMSAs with a P-labeled -170 to -139 probe and nuclear extracts from Jurkat and HeLa cells .
As shown in Fig .
1A , major ( C2 ) and minor ( C1 and C3 ) complexes were detected in the nuclear extracts from the unstimulated Jurkat ( lane 1 ) and HeLaS3 3716 LIN AND LEONARD ( lane 3 ) cells .
Consistent with the ability of the -170 to -139 enhancer region to respond to PMA stimulation in Jurkat but not in HeLa cells ( 30 ) , treatment of the cells with PMA induced formation of two new complexes , C4 and CS5 , in the nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells ( lane 2 ) but not in those from HeLa cells ( lane 4 ) .
PMA treatment did not affect the complexes C1 , C2 , and C3 ( lane 2 versus lane 1 ) .
Induction of the C4 complex by PMA was somewhat variable , because C4 was sometimes detected in nuclear extracts from untreated Jurkat cells .
To confirm the specificity of these complexes and to examine if they bound to distinct regions of the -170 to -139 probe , we performed competition experiments .
As expected , the -170 to -139 oligonucleotide competed with the formation of all of the complexes ( Fig .
1B , lane 4 ) , although for reasons unclear , the competition of CZ was less effective .
Interestingly , the -170 to -155 oligonucleotide markedly diminished the formation of the C1 , C2 , C3 , and C4 complexes but was less effective in inhibiting formation of C5 ( lane 5 ) , whereas the -158 to -142 oligonucleotide competed with the formation of the C4 and C5 complexes but did not affect C1 , C2 , and C3 ( lane 6 ) .
An oligonucleotide corresponding to the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) Sp1 site abolished the formation of the C1 , C2 , C3 , and C4 complexes but had no effect on the formation of the CS complex ( lane 7 ) , suggesting that Spl-like factor ( s ) might be involved in complexes C1 to C4 but not CS .
An unrelated oligonucleotide corresponding to the -56 to -34 region of the IL-2RB promoter that is known to bind to Ets family proteins did not affect any of the complexes ( lane 3 versus lane 2 ) .
When used in EMSAs , the -158 to -142 oligonucleotide exhibited a single PMA-inducible complex of much greater intensity than was seen with the -170 to -139 probe ( Fig .
1C , lane 4 versus lane 2 ) .
The pattern of DNA complexes formed with Jurkat nuclear extracts with the -170 to -155 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
1C , lanes 5 and 6 ) was indistinguishable from that with the SV40 Sp1 probe ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Thus , the -170 to -139 region appeared to have two subregions , with complexes C2 and C3 binding to the -170 to -155 region and complex C5 binding primarily to the -158 to -142 region .
However , the facts that the -170 to -155 oligonucleotide could partially inhibit CS5 formation ( Fig .
1B ) and that a complex comigrating with C5 could be detected when the -170 to -155 oligonucleotide was used as a probe ( Fig .
1C , lane 6 ) suggest that both regions could independently contribute to formation of C5 .
C1 and C4 formation appeared to require both subregions , because neither complex was detected except with the full-length -170 to -139 probe .
Consistent with the 5 ' portion of the -170 to -139 region containing an Spl binding motif , both the -170 to -139 and -170 to -155 oligonucleotides could bind purified human Sp1 with a pattern indistinguishable from that seen with the SV40 Sp1 probe ( Fig .
1D , lanes 1 and 2 versus lane 4 ) .
In contrast , the -158 to -142 oligonucleotide did not bind Spl ( lane 3 ) .
Three additional closely related Sp1 family proteins ( Sp2 , Sp3 , and Sp4 ) have been identified ( 19 , 25 ) .
We therefore performed EMSAs with the -170 to -155 probe and antibodies specific for all four Sp1 family proteins to determine which were involved in the Sp complexes .
As shown in Fig .
16 , an anti-Sp1 antibody supershifted most of the major complex , which migrated with a slower mobility ( lane 2 versus lane 1 ) , and an anti-Sp3 antibody blocked the complex with a faster mobility ( lane 4 versus lane 1 ) , whereas antibodies to Sp2 ( lane 3 ) or Sp4 ( lane 5 ) had no effect .
These data establish that both Spl and Sp3 bind to the -170 to -155 region , the PMA-inducible factor ( PIF ) in the C5 complex binds to the -158 to Mor .

Methylation interference analyses .
Double-stranded -170 to -151 ( A ) and -158 to -139 ( C ) probes were end labeled on the top ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or bottom ( lanes 4 to 6 ) strands and partially methylated with dimethyl sulfate .
EMSAs were performed with nuclear extract from Jurkat cells treated with PMA and the methylated probes .
For both panels A and C , free ( lanes 1 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) and bound ( lanes 2 and 5 ) probes were excised in situ and eluted from the gel , treated with piperidine ( Fisher Scientific ) , lyophilized , resolved on a 12 % sequencing gel , and autoradiographed .
The results from panels A and C are summarized in panels B and D , respectively .
Strong interference with binding due to methylation of G residues is indicated by solid circles , and weak interference with binding is indicated by open circles .
-142 region , and the PMA-inducible C4 complex may contain both Sp1 family protein ( s ) and PIF .
Compared to the full-length -170 to -139 probe , more intense binding activities were seen with the -170 to -155 and -158 to -142 probes ( Fig .
1C ) .
To further define the DNA binding sequences of these nuclear complexes , we performed methylation interference assays .
Consistent with the data obtained from the EMSAs in Fig .
1 , the methylation interference pattern obtained with a -170 to -151 probe revealed that the nuclear factors in C2 ( Fig .
2A , lanes 2 and 5 [ summarized in Fig .
2B ] ) and C3 ( data not shown ) indeed contacted the Spl motif ( 5 ! -GTGTGCCGCCCCCAG-3 ' ) between -169 and -155 , whereas the methylation interference pattern obtained with a -158 to -139 probe indicated that PIF contacted the region between -155 and -143 ( Fig .
2C , lanes 2 and 5 ; summarized in Fig .
2D ) .
As expected , the wild-type -158 to -142 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
3A ) efficiently competed for PMA-inducible DNA binding activity to a -158 to -142 probe ( Fig .
3B , lane 3 versus lane 2 ) .
Consistent with the data from the methylation interference assays , mutation of either the GCG residues at -155 to -153 into CAC ( lane 4 versus lane 2 ) or GAG residues at -149 to -147 into TCT ( lane 5 versus lane 2 ) of the -158 to -142 oligonucleotide abolished its ability to compete for PIF binding to the wild-type probe , and neither of these mutant oligonucleotides could bind PIF ( Fig .
3C , lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2 ) .
The DNA binding motif for PIF differs from the consensus motifs of other known PIFs , including AP-1 ( TGA CTCA ) and NF- « B ( GGGRNNYYCC ) ( 1 ) .
As expected , oligonucleotides corresponding to AP-1 ( lane 6 ) , NF-KB ( lane 7 ) , and NF-AT ( lane 8 ) binding sites did not compete for PIF binding .
Furthermore , in contrast to the ability of antibodies to c-Fos and c-Jun to compete for NF-AT binding ( 10 , 35 ) , a number of antibodies that specifically recognize c-Fos , c-Jun Vor .

PIF is different from AP-1 , NF-xB , and NF-AT .

The NF-AT sequence is from the murine IL-2 promoter ( 31 ) .
( B ) Prior to addition of the radiolabeled -158 to -142 probe , the nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either untreated ( lane 1 ) or treated with PMA ( lanes 2 to 8 ) were incubated either with no competitor ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or with 25 ng of the following unlabeled competitors : wild type ( WT ; lane 3 ) or mutant ( lanes 4 and 5 ) -158 to -142 oligonucleotides or oligonucleotides corresponding to AP-1 ( lane 6 ) , HIV « B ( lane 7 ) , or NF-AT ( lane 8 ) sites .
( C ) EMSA was performed with radiolabeled wild-type ( WT ; lanes 1 and 2 ) and mutant ( Mut-1 in lane 3 , Mut-2 in lane 4 ) -158 to -142 oligonucleotide probes and nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either untreated ( lane 1 ) or treated with PMA for 2 h ( lanes 2 to 4 ) .
proteins , or Fos or Jun family proteins did not affect PIF binding activity ( data not shown ) , diminishing the possibility that AP-1 family proteins are involved in the PIF complex .
PIF binding activity is rapidly induced by PMA and de novo protein synthesis is required for its production .
A kinetic analysis revealed that PIF DNA binding activity was detectable as early as 30 min after treatment of Jurkat cells with PMA ( Fig .
4A , lane 2 ) , was maximal between 1 and 2 h ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , and was sustained at a high level for at least 23 h ( lane 6 ) .
Interestingly , PIF DNA binding activity was only very weakly and transiently detected in HeLa nuclear extracts at 1 h ( Fig .
4B , lane 5 ) and 2 h ( lane 6 ) following PMA treatment , but at a much lower level than that seen with Jurkat nuclear extracts ( lane 2 ) .
The transient weak activation of PIF in HeLaS3 cells was not sufficient to activate a CAT reporter construct in response to PMA in these cells with either of the -158 to -142 ( not shown ) or -170 to -139 ( 30 ) regions .
Because PIF was rapidly induced , we investigated whether de novo protein synthesis was required for its induction or whether like NF- « xB , it was present in a latent form in the cells .
Jurkat cells were treated with PMA in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , and nuclear extracts were prepared .
Cycloheximide did not induce PIF ( Fig .

( F ) Constitutive PIF binding activity in HTLV-1-transformed MT-2 cells .
Radiolabeled -158 to -142 probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or MT-2 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) cells .
PIF DNA binding activity ( lane 4 versus lane 3 ) .
In contrast , as previously reported ( 1 ) , cycloheximide not only induced ( Fig .
4D , lane 2 ) but in fact superinduced NF-kB binding activity by PMA ( lane 4 versus 3 ) .
Thus , de novo protein synthesis is essential for the production of PIF .
PIF binding activity is induced by PMA but not by PHA or IL-2 in normal PBLs and is constitutively expressed in HTLV-1-transformed MT-2 cells .
In addition to its induction in Jurkat T cells , PIF binding activity was induced by PMA in normal PBLs ( Fig .
4E , lane 2 versus lane 1 ) .
However , whereas a single major PIF complex was detected in Jurkat nuclear extracts ( Fig .
4F , lane 2 ) , two complexes were detected in the nuclear 3718 LIN AND LEONARD extracts from PBLs isolated from three independent donors ( Fig .
4E , lane 2 , and data not shown ) , and the upper complex comigrated with the Jurkat PIF complex ( data not shown ) .
The basis for the added complex in PBLs is unclear and requires further investigation .
Neither complex was induced by PHA ( lane 3 ) or IL-2 ( lane 4 ) .
These results indicate that unlike NF-kB , PIF binding activity appears to be mainly induced by PMA .
Many cellular genes are activated in HTLV-1-infected T cells by a 40-kDa viral transactivator Tax protein of HTLV-1 ( 32 , 51 ) .
Tax activates transcription of these genes by modulating the DNA binding activity of transcription factors , including AP-1 , ATF/CREB , and NF-kB .
Some of these PMA-inducible transcription factors , like c-fos and NF-KB , are constitutively expressed at high levels in HTLV-1-transformed MT -2 cells and are known to be activated by Tax in these cells ( 51 ) .
We therefore examined whether PIF DNA binding activity was affected in MT-2 cells .
Constitutive PIF DNA binding activity was detected in MT-2 nuclear extracts ( Fig .
4F , lane 3 ) , and it was also modestly increased after PMA treatment ( lane 4 versus lane 3 ) , suggesting that HTLV-1 protein ( s ) might activate PIF via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway .
Determination of the molecular mass of PIF .
To further characterize PIF , we performed Southwestern assays with the -158 to -139 probe .
Two proteins migrating at 82 and 60 kDa , respectively , were detected with a wild-type ( Fig .
5A , lane 2 ) but not mutant ( lane 4 ) probe in nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells after PMA stimulation ( lane 2 ) and from unstimulated MT-2 cells ( data not shown ) .
No proteins were detected in the nuclear extracts from unstimulated Jurkat cells ( lane 1 ) .
A constitutively expressed 120-kDa protein was detected by both wild-type ( Fig .
5A , lanes 1 and 2 ) and mutant ( lanes 3 and 4 ) probes , indicating that it binds to the sequences unrelated to the PIF site .
PIF is Egr-1 .
The rapid induction of PIF and the requirement of de novo protein synthesis for its DNA binding activity suggested that PIF was encoded by an immediate-early gene .
Because PIF contains 82- and 60-kDa DNA binding proteins ( Fig .
5A ) , we investigated whether PIF was related to the Zn finger-containing Egr family of transcription factors , which are immediate-early gene products induced by a variety of stimuli , including PMA , and which have a molecular mass of 80 to 82 kDa ( 5 , 44 ) .
In EMSAs with Jurkat nuclear extracts , an Egr-1 binding site ( EBS-1 ; CGCCCCCGC ) ( 5 ) bound to a PIF binding activity ( Fig .
5B , lane 4 versus lane 3 ) that comigrated with the PIF seen with the -158 to -142 probe ( lane 2 ) .
Although the core DNA binding sites differed ( 5'-GCGTAGGAGGCA G-3 ' for PIF and 5-CGCCCCCGC-3 ' for Egr-1 ) , the unlabeled -158 to -142 and EBS-1 oligonucleotides nevertheless inhibited PIF binding activity ( Fig .
5C , lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1 and lanes 5 and 6 versus lane 4 ) , with the -158 to -142 oligonucleotide being less efficient ( lanes 2 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 5 ) .
These results indicate that Egr family protein ( s ) are likely involved in the formation of the PMA-inducible DNA complex .
This notion was further supported by the fact that anti-Egr-1 antisera either abolished ( Fig .
5D , lanes 3 and 6 ) or supershifted ( data not shown ) PMA-inducible DNA binding activity to either the -158 to -142 or EBS-1 probe , whereas antisera specific for other Egr family proteins , including Egr-2 , Egr-3 , and Wilm 's tumor antigen , did not affect protein binding to either probe ( not shown ) .
These results establish that the PIF that bound to the -158 to -142 region in the human IL-2RB promoter is Egr-1 , and we therefore redenote the -158 to -142 region PIF as an Egr-1 site .
Although the consensus DNA binding site for Egr-1 was defined as GCGKGG GCG ( 8 ) , our data show that Egr-1 can recognize a DNA Mor .

Characterization of PIF .
( A ) Southwestern analysis with the -158 to -139 probe .
Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either untreated ( lanes 1 and 3 ) or treated with PMA for 1 h ( lanes 2 and 4 ) were analyzed by Southwestern assay with either radiolabeled wild-type ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or mutant ( lanes 3 and 4 ) -158 to -139 probes .
A 120-kDa band constitutively present in the nuclear extracts is indicated by an asterisk .
Molecular masses were determined by comparisons with the mobilities of prestained molecular markers ( Amersham ) .
( B ) PIF comigrates with Egr family protein ( s ) .
Results are from EMSA with radiolabeled -158 to -142 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or canonical Egr binding motif ( EBS-1 ; lanes 3 and 4 ) probes and nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either unstimulated ( lanes 1 and 3 ) or stimulated with PMA ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
( C ) Inhibition of PIF DNA binding activity by Egr DNA binding site .
Results are from EMSA with radiolabeled -158 to -142 ( lanes 1 to 3 ) and the canonical Egr binding motif ( EBS-1 ; lanes 4 to 6 ) probes and nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either unstimulated ( lanes 1 and 4 ) or stimulated with PMA ( lanes 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) .
The extracts were incubated with either the unlabeled -158 to -142 probe ( lanes 2 and 6 ) or the Egr binding site ( EBS-1 ; lanes 3 and 5 ) prior to addition of the radiolabeled probes .

Results are from EMSA with radiolabeled -158 to -142 ( lanes 1 to 3 ) and the canonical Egr binding motif ( EBS-1 ; lanes 4 to 6 ) probes and nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either unstimulated ( lanes 1 and 4 ) or stimulated with PMA ( lanes 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) .
Prior to addition of the radiolabeled probes , the extracts were incubated either with anti-Stat5 ( Stat5 ; lanes 2 and 5 ) as a control antiserum or with anti-Egr-1 ( Egr-1 ; lanes 3 and 6 ) .
In panels B to D , a constitutive DNA binding activity was detected by the EBS-1 probe , as indicated by asterisks .
sequence very different from the consensus .
Because a 60- to 62-kDa truncated form of Egr-1 has also been reported ( 15 ) and the anti-Egr-1 antiserum abolishes PIF binding to the -158 to -142 probe ( Fig .

Egr-1 binds to both Sp1 and Egr-1 sites at the -170 to -139 region .
( A ) Sequences of wild-type ( WT ) , Sp1 mutant ( Sp1-M ) , Egr-1 mutant ( Egr-M ) , and Sp1 plus Egr-1 mutant ( Sp1/Egr-M ) -170 to -139 oligonucleotides , show ing the Spl and Egr-1 motifs , and mutated nucleotides ( underlined in lowercase ) .
( B ) EMSA with radiolabeled wild-type ( WT ; lanes 1 and 2 ) , Sp1 mutant ( Sp1-M ; lanes 3 and 4 ) , Egr-1 mutant ( Egr-M ; lanes 5 and 6 ) , and Sp1 plus Egr-1 mutant ( Sp1/Egr-M ; lanes 7 and 8 ) probes and nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either unstimulated ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ) or stimulated with PMA ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) .
( C ) EMSA with radiolabeled wild-type ( WT ; lanes 1 to 6 ) and Egr-1 mutant ( Mut ; lanes 7 to 12 ) -170 to -139 probes and nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells either unstimulated ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 ) or stimulated with PMA ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 ) .
Prior to addition of the probes , the extracts were incubated either with control ( lanes 1 , 2 , 7 , and 8 ) , anti-Egr-1 ( Egr-1 ; lanes 3 , 4 , 9 , and 10 ) , or anti-Sp1 ( Sp1 ; lanes 5 , 6 , 11 , and 12 ) antiserum .
The anti-Sp1 supershifted complexes are indicated by an asterisk .
protein detected by Southwestern blotting ( Fig .
5A ) might be a truncated form of Egr-1 .
The Sp site also binds to Egr-1 , and the integrity of both Sp and Egr-1 sites is essential for IL-2RB promoter activity .
We next evaluated how mutation of the Sp and/or Egr-1 binding sites ( Fig .
6A ) affected the formation of each complex with the -170 to -139 probe .
Mutation of the Sp site abolished the formation of complexes C1 , C3 , and C4 and greatly diminished that of C2 ( Fig .
6B , lanes 3 and 4 ) , whereas that of C5 was actually increased , suggesting that Spl and/or Sp3 have higher DNA binding affinities to the wild-type oligonucleotide and probably interfere with the binding of Egr-1 .
Mutation of the Egr-1 site abolished the C1 and C4 complexes , but as expected , had no effect on the CZ and C3 complexes .
Interestingly , this mutation had no significant effect on the PMA-inducible CS complex ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , suggesting that in addition to the Egr-1 site at -158 to -142 , this factor likely recognizes other sequences within the -170 to -139 region , consistent with our earlier observation that both the -158 to -142 and -170 to -155 oligonucleotides could inhibit CS5 formation ( Fig .
1B ) .
As expected , mutation of both Sp and Egr-1 sites abolished all of the complexes ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
To determine whether the C4 and CS5 complexes both contained Egr-1 and whether the PIF bound to the -170 to -139 probe containing a mutation at the Egr-1 site was also Egr-1 , we performed EMSA with anti-Egr-1 antiserum .
As shown in REGULATION OF IL-Z2RB PROMOTER BY Egr1 - 3719 Fig .
6C , the anti-Egr-1 antiserum abolished the formation of both the C4 and CS5 complexes ( lane 4 versus lane 2 ) .
In addition , the PMA-inducible complex bound to the Egr-1 mutant -170 to -139 probe was also recognized by anti-Egr-1 antiserum ( lane 10 versus lane 8 ) , suggesting that Egr-1 may bind to the Sp site on the basis of the similarity between the Egr-1 and Sp sites .
In contrast , when all three probes were used ( Fig .
6C ) , anti-Sp1 antiserum only supershifted the C2 complex and had no effect on Egr-1 binding .
Together with the results of Fig .
1 , these data demonstrate that the Sp site not only binds to Sp1 and Sp3 but also binds to Egr-1 .
In the context of the -170 to -139 region with the heter-ologous thymidine kinase promoter , mutation of the Sp1 site diminished basal enhancer activity but had less of an effect on the fold induction by PMA ; mutation of both sites was required to significantly diminish PMA-inducible enhancer activity ( Fig .
7A ) .
In the context of the -548 to +97 IL-2RB promoter , the greatest effect was also seen when both Spl and Egr-1 sites were simultaneously mutated ( Fig .
7B ) , indicating that both of the Sp1 and Egr-1 sites are required for maximal IL-2RB promoter activity .
Since much less endogenous Egr-1 was detected in HeLaS3 cells than in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
4B ) , we next evaluated whether overexpression of Egr-1 in HeLaS3 cells could drive expression of the IL-2RB constructs .
Indeed , the pTKB-170/-139 reporter construct was activated by Egr-1 , and activity was diminished when both of the Sp1 and Egr-1 sites were mutated ( Fig .
7C ) .
Interestingly , there was very little , if any , PMA inducibility whether the cells were cultured in the presence of 10 % ( data not shown ) or 0.5 % ( Fig .
7C ) serum , indicating that overexpression of Egr-1 in HeLaS3 cells obviated the need for PMA treatment .
In contrast , no induction was seen with the -548 to +97 IL-2RB promoter construct , even when both Ets-1 and GABPs were also coexpressed ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the additional lineage-restricted factor ( s ) are required for IL-2RB promoter activity .
In view of the importance of both Sp and Egr-1 sites at the -170 to -139 region for IL-2RB promoter activity and the fact that Sp1 can form complexes with either itself or with other transcription factors ( see Discussion ) , we investigated whether Sp1 could form a complex with Egr-1 to regulate the IL-2RB promoter .
In coimmunoprecipitation experiments , we found that Egr-1 could be precipitated by anti-Spl antiserum in response to PMA stimulation ( Fig .
8A , lanes 2 to 4 versus lane 1 ) , and the amount of Egr-1 coimmunoprecipitated correlated with the expression level of Egr-1 in the cells ( lanes 5 to 8 ) .
To evaluate the possibility that coimmunoprecipitation of Egr-1 by anti-Sp1 antiserum required the presence of DNA , total cell lysates were incubated with ethidium bromide prior to immunoprecipitation to eliminate DNA-dependent protein-protein interactions ( 26 ) .
Anti-Spl antiserum was still able to efficiently coprecipitate Egr-1 proteins even after treatment of the lysates with ethidium bromide ( Fig .
8B , lanes 3 and 4 ) , although the amounts of Egr-1 coprecipitated by anti-Sp1 antiserum were somewhat smaller than that seen in the lysate without ethidium bromide treatment ( lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2 ) .
These results suggest that both DNA -independent and -de-pendent interactions of Sp1 and Egr-1 exist and also imply that the Sp1-Egr-1 complex can simultaneously occupy both Sp and Egr-1 sites at the -170 to -139 region , thus regulating IL-2RB promoter activity .

Both Sp1 and Egr-1 sites are required for maximal promoter activity .
( A ) The enhancer CAT reporter plasmid pBLCAT2 and pTKB-170/-139 constructs ( WT ; Sp1 mutant [ Sp1-MJ , Egr-1 mutant [ Egr-MJ , and Sp1 plus Egr-1 mutant [ Sp1/Egr-M ] ) were transfected into Jurkat cells .
( B ) The promoter CAT reporter plasmid JOCAT and JMXHB-548/+97 constructs ( WT ; Sp1 mutant [ Sp1-MJ , Egr-1 mutant [ Egr-M ] , and Sp1 plus Egr-1 mutant [ Sp1/Egr-M ] ) were transfected into Jurkat cells .
In both panels , the cells were either not treated ( open bars ) or were treated with PMA ( solid bars ) overnight before being harvested for CAT assays .
Data represent the means + standard errors derived from three independent experiments .
The activities of pBLCAT2 ( A ) and JOCAT ( B ) without PMA treatment are assigned a value of 1.0 ; the activities of other constructs are expressed as relative fold increases .
( C ) Cotransfections of HeLaS3 cells were performed with the following combinations : pBLCAT2 plus either peDNA3.1neo ( Vector ) or p930 , wild-type pTKB-170/-139 ( WT ) plus either peDNA3.1neo ( Vector ) or p930 , and pTKB-170/-139 construct mutated at both Sp1 and Egr-1 sites ( Sp1/Egr-M ) plus p930 .
The cells were either not treated or treated with PMA overnight before harvest and measurement of CAT activities .
Data represent the means + standard errors derived from three independent experiments .
The activity of pBLCAT2 plus pcDNA3.1neo without PMA treatment is assigned a value of 1.0. is controlled by Spl family proteins and the immediate-early gene product Egr-1 .
Sp1 was originally identified as a ubiquitously expressed mammalian transcription factor that binds to GC box promoter elements and activates the SV40 early promoter ( 13 ) .
It has also been shown to be important for the promoter activity of many other viral and cellular genes .
At least in some cases , Sp1 activates transcription by cooperative interaction either with itself ( 41 ) or with other transcription factors , such as the EZ protein bound to the bovine papillo-mavirus enhancer ( 29 ) , Tat protein bound to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat ( 21 , 22 ) , NF-kBp65 bound to the HIV-1 enhancer ( 34 ) , and Rb protein bound to the retinoblastoma control element in c-fos , c-myc , and transforming growth factor B1 genes ( 49 ) .
In the IL-2RB promoter , a functional Sp1 binding site located at the -169 to -155 region is required mainly for basal promoter activity .
Interestingly , Spl is also physically associated with Egr-1 in vivo upon PMA stimulation .
Because both Sp1 and Egr-1 can simultaneously bind to the -170 to -139 region , it is likely that Sp1-Egr-1 complex formation plays a role in regulating IL-Z2RB promoter activity in response to PMA .
Our observation that either Sp1 or Egr-1 can bind to an Sp binding site in the IL-2RB promoter region is similar to a report ( 39 ) that the ZIP ( zinc finger protein binding ) region in the IL-2 promoter binds independently to either Spl or Egr-1 proteins .
However , in addition to the Sp binding site , the IL-2RB promoter has an adjacent Egr-1 binding site just downstream of the Sp site at the -170 to -139 region , which only binds to Egr-1 .
Mutation of either the Sp or Egr-1 site alone at the -170 to -139 region diminished IL-2RB promoter activity , whereas simultaneous mutation of both sites abolished promoter activity .
Given that we have previously shown that the EBS in the -56 to -34 region is essential but not sufficient for promoter activity ( 30 ) , it is clear that both the -170 to -139 region and the EBS at -56 and -34 are required , but neither of them alone is sufficient for IL-2RB promoter activity .
Thus , inducible expression of the IL-2RB promoter is most likely regulated by functional cooperation between both the Sp1 and Egr-1 sites in the -170 to -139 region and the EBS in the -56 to -34 region .
Although only a few genes are known to be regulated by Egr-1 in hematopoietic cells , the ability to induce Egr-1 expression in response to mitogens or differentiation stimuli is well correlated with proliferation of B lymphocytes or differentiation of monocytes .
In mature B cells , anti-p antibodies induce Egr-1 expression and promote cell proliferation , whereas in immature B cells , these antibodies do not induce Egr-1 expression , inhibit cell proliferation , and thereby eventually cause cell death ( 36 ) .
In U937 and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells , PMA induces Egr-1 expression and causes monocytic differentiation ( 23 , 24 ) , whereas dexamethasone blocks Egr-1 expression and inhibits differentiation ( 23 ) .
Furthermore , Egr-1 antisense oligonucleotides can prevent macrophage differentiation induced by PMA , whereas constitutive expression of Egr-1 favors macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells but prevents granulocyte differentiation induced by dimethyl ] sulfoxide in these cells ( 33 ) .
The role of Egr-1 in fibroblasts and certain hematopoietic cells has been more extensively studied ; however , little is known about the role played by Egr-1 and/or other Egr family proteins in T cells .
The coordinate regulation of both the IL-2 ( 39 ) and IL-2RB genes in T cells by Egr-1 and Sp1 suggests that these factors may coordinately influence expression of a range of T-cell-specific genes during T-cell activation .
The optimal targets for the Egr-1 site have not been defined by a DNA binding site selection assay , and we now show here that the Egr-1 site in the IL-Z2RB promoter binds well to Egr-1 despite the fact that the site is markedly different from the canonical site ( 8 ) .
Therefore , we hypothesize that other noncanonical Egr sites will be identified in the promoter regions of other T-cell-specific genes that play a role in regulating gene expression in response to mitogen stimulation .
Interestingly , PHA does not induce Egr-1 , but some of the cytokines produced by the cells in response to mitogen or antigen stimula- Vor .

Association of Egr-1 with Sp1 in Jurkat cells upon PMA stimulation .
Jurkat cells were either untreated ( lanes 1 and 5 ) or treated with PMA for 30 min ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , 2 h ( lanes 3 and 7 ) , or 18 h ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .
Cells were then lysed , and lysates were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with anti-Sp1 ( lanes 1 to 4 ) .
In lanes 5 to 8 , aliquots of lysates were blotted with anti-Egr-1 as controls for the amount of Egr-1 induced at the different time points .
( B ) Total cell lysates were prepared from Jurkat cells either untreated ( lane 1 ) or treated with PMA for 2 h ( lanes 2 to 4 ) .
The lysates were either untreated ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or treated with 25 ( lane 3 ) or 100 ( lane 4 ) ug of ethidium bromide ( EtdBr ) per ml as described in Materials and Methods .
Western blotting was performed with antisera specific for Egr-1 or Sp1 and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence .
Egr-1 and Sp1 proteins are indicated by arrows , and the immunoglobulin heavy chain is indicated by asterisks .
tion , like IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha , induce Egr-1 expression ( 15 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that Egr-1 is induced by IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha during T-cell activation and serves as an important mediator that regulates expression of a broad range of genes .
