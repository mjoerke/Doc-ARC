Laboratory of Microbiology and Host Defenses and Laboratory of Genetic Engineering , School of Food and Nutritional Sciences , University of Shizuoka , Yada , Shizuoka 422-8526 , Japan Key words : - C/EBPa/C/EBPB/MRP14/HL-60 cells/1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; /THP-1 cells ABSTRACT .
Transcriptional regulation of the gene for the myeloid calcium binding protein , MRP14 , was investigated in human monocytic leukemia cell lines .
The MRP14 gene was not expressed in monoblastic ML-1 cells , promonocytic U-937 cells , or promyelocytic HL-60 cells .
On the other hand , the gene was expressed in monocytic THP cells and in the HL-60 cells treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; , ( VD ; ) .
The level of MRP14 in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells was two-fold higher than that in THP-1 cells .
Among several known transcription factor binding motifs , nuclear protein ( s ) of VD ; -treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells bound to the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) -binding motif that was located in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene ( -81 ) , as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility-shift assay .
An antibody for C/EBPa supershifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP-1 cells but not in the VD ; -treated HL-60 cells , whereas an antibody for C/EBP # blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL-60 cells but not with that of THP-1 cells .
An antibody had no effect on the complex in either cell .
Thus , it was concluded that C/EBP a and - # were able to bind to the C/EBP motif , and that C/EBPa bound to the motif in THP-1 cells and C/EBP / } bound to that in the VD ; -treated HL-60 cells .
Furthermore , to examine the transcriptional activity of the C/EBP motif , we transfected several constructed luciferase reporter DNAs into HL-60 cells and THP -1 cells .
The luciferase activity of the C/EBP motif in HL-60 cells was increased by VD ; treatment .
The C/EBP motif in the MRP14 gene was confirmed to function as a regulatory region in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells by the assay .
Since C/EBP / } was also detected in VD ; -untreated HL-60 cells by immunoblotting , VD , ; activated C/EBP # to bind to the motif , probably through post-translational modification .
Myeloid calcium binding proteins , MRP8 and MRP14 ( 25 , 35 ) , also designated cystic fibrosis antigen ( 5 , 12 ) , the leukocyte L1 molecule ( 4 ) , the 60B8 antigen ( 34 , 55 ) , p8/p14 ( 17 ) , calgranulin A/B ( 22 ) , and calprotectin ( 51 , 66 ) , are members of the $ 100 protein family , whose genes are known to be localized in the cluster on human chromosome 1q21 ( 46 ) .
Therefore , it has been proposed that MRP8 and MRP 14 be called $ 100A¥8 and $ 100A9 , respectively ( 46 ) .
They are expressed in myeloid lineage cells ( 17 , 34 ) and in certain epithelial cells ( 63 , 68 ) .
MRP8 and MRP14 are not expressed in normal macrophages but are detected in macrophages that have infiltrated into inflammatory lesions ( 35 , 40 , 43 , 68 ) .
Differential expression of MRP8 and MRP14 in such macrophages has been reported ( 11 , 68 ) , proba- * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

109 bly reflecting the clinical manifestation of inflammatory diseases .
MRP proteins are also essential as a diagnostic marker being abundant in serum of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and other connective tissue diseases ( 5 , 14 , 23 ) and with hematological disorders such as chronic myeloid leukemia ( 20 ) .
Furthermore , the protein was detected in feces of certain colon cancer patients ( 13 , 42 ) .
MRPs are induced in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that have differentiated into macro-phage-like cells by treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( VD ; ) ( 34 , 55 ) .
The MRP8 and MRP14 mRNAs were co-transcribed starting one day after VD ; treatment ( 23 , 24 ) .
The mRNA level reached a peak on day two and then quickly declined .
We have investigated how the expressions of MRP8 and MRP14 genes are co-expressed .
Roth et al .
suggested that a cal-cium-induced suppressor protein was responsible for suppression of MRP8 and MRP14 at the transcriptional level ( 44 ) .
In our previous study , differentia- tion-specific binding of nuclear factors to the 5'-upstream regions of MRP8 and MRP 14 genes were identified , together with consensus sequences for several known transcription factor binding motifs in these regions ( 24 ) .
In this study we aimed to examine where the promoter elements in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene were located and what transcription factors bound to these elements .
Two DNA fragments in the upstream region of the MRP 14 gene were prepared , and factors that bound to these fragments were detected by the gel mobility-shift assay .
A factor bound to the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) -binding motif ( -81 ) of a fragment , depending on the VD ; -in-duced differentiation .
C/EBP family is a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor and has several members ( 1 , 6 , 10 , 26 , 41 ) .
C/EBPa and -8 are reported to recognize the same nucleotide sequence ( 1 ) .
We identified that the binding factor was in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells , C/EBPa in human monocytic leukemia THP cells , which constitutively expressed MRP pro-teins .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and culture Human promyelocytic HL-60 , monocytic THP -1 , promonocytic U-937 , and monoblastic ML-1 leukemia cells were cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inacti-vated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Bioserum , Australia ) and 100 ug/ral each of sodium ampicillin and kanamycin sulfate at 37°C in a 5 % CO ; incubator .
The HL-60 cells ( 2 x 10° cells per ml ) were treated with 107 '' M VD ; , ( Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. , Tokyo ) for up to 6 days with the medium renewed every 3 days .
THP -1 and U-937 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank .
Human peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils were purified as described previously ( 34 ) .
Northern blot hybridization Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells by the guanidini-um/cesium chloride method ( 45 ) .
Northern blot hybridization was performed using P-labeled MRP8 , MRP14 , and $ -actin cDNA probes ( 23 , 24 ) .

Gel mobility-shift analysis The 5 '' -upstream region of the MRP14 gene ( sequences from -1,000 to +50 ) was amplified by PCR , using a sense primer ; S-ATCACTGTGGAGTAGGGGAA-3 ' and an antisense primer ; 5-GGGAAGCTGGCAGCTCACTT-3 ' ( 24 ) .
The amplified MRP14 gene fragment was then cleaved with Sac I and Hae II ( Takara Biomedicals , Kyoto ) into 251 bp ( -400 to -150 ) and 199 bp ( -149 to +50 ) fragments , which are designated £251 and £199 , respectively ( Fig .
4A ) .
The fragments were further purified by electrophoresis on DEAE cellulose membrane ( S & S , Dassel , F.R.G . )
( 45 ) and used as probes for the gel mobility-shift analysis .
Oligonucleotides containing IRF-1 ( half-site ) , Spl , or C/EBP element ( Table I ) and each complementary oligomer were synthesized and annealed by heating both oligonucleotides at 90°C for 2 min and then at 70°C for 10 min followed by cooling to room temperature .
These DNA fragments were used as competitors for the gel mobility-shift analysis .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured HL-60 and THP -1 cells according to the method of Schreiber et al .
( 47 ) .
The DNA fragments were end-labeled with [ y-2P ] ATP ( DuPont , NEN , F.R.G . )
by T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Takara Biomedicals , Kyoto ) and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Gel mobility-shift analysis was performed as described previously ( 24 ) .
Competition experiments were performed by adding excess amounts of synthetic oligonucleotides or herring sperm DNA for 10 min prior to addition of the labeled probe .
For supershift experiments , 1 ul of poly-clonal rabbit antibody specific to C/EBP , - $ , or -5 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA ) that specifically reacts with human C/EBP a , - $ , or -8 , respectively , and that is non cross-reactive with other members of C/EBP family ( supplier 's manual ) , was added to the reaction mixture for 1 hour at 4°C before the addition of the probe .
As a control , the heated ( 10 min ) anti-C/EBP/ # antibody or normal rabbit serum ( 1 : 100 dilution ) was added .
The reaction products were then analyzed by 4 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
The radiographic image was analyzed by a BAS2000 imaging analyzer ( Fuji Film Co. Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) or autoradio-graphs .
Plasmids For the construction of the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) expression vector , the Pst I-Sal I1 sGFP ( S65T ) fragment ( 0.7 kb ) was inserted between the Pst I site and Xho I site of the zH3M plasmid containing the chimeric CMV /HIV promoter Table I .

This plasmid was designated zH3M-GFP ( 4.2 kb ) .
The zH3M-luc plasmid ( 5.4 kb ) was constructed by insertion of luciferase cDNA ( 1.9 kb ) between the blunt-ended Pst I site and the Xho I site of the zH3M plasmid and was used as a positive control .
pIGCAT-MRP14 was constructed by fusing the PCR-amplified MRP14 gene ( -1,000 to +430 ) and pIGCAT ( 18 ) .
The blunt-ended Sal I-Bal II fragment including CAT cDNA and the SV40 polyadenylation site of pIGCAT-MRP14 was replaced by the blunt-ended Hind III-BamH I fragment ( 2.8 kb ) of zH3M-luc , including luciferase cDNA , pSV2 splice and polyadenylation signals .
The resultant plasmid was named p1000-luc ( 7.8 kb ) .
pIG-lue was pro-moterless and had a defect in the p1000-luc region of the MRP14 gene , and was used as a negative control ( 6.4 kb ) .
p73-luc plasmid included the region of the MRP14 gene from -73 to +430 , which is the downstream region than the C/EBP binding motif .
The p1000 ( -C/EBP ) -lue plasmid , which was defective in the C/EBP binding motif , was constructed by inserting an upstream region of the C/EBP binding motif in the MRP14 gene ( -1,000 to -89 ) , which was amplified in a Thermo Processor ( TAITEC ) using a sense primer ; S-ATAAAGCTTCTAGATCACTGTGGAGTAGG GGAA-3 ' and an antisense primer ; S-AAAGGATCCGTGA GCAGTGTGGTAATGCT-3 ' , into the p73-luc plasmid .
Mono-mers and multimers ( three copies ) of the wild type and mutated C/EBP oligonucleotides ( Table II ) were fused to the p73-lue construct ( Fig .
5 ) .
Transfections Cells were resuspended at 1 % 10/200 wl in serum-free F12 medium ( pH 7.2 with NaOH ) .
In some experiments , FBS was added to 10 % .
Twenty-five micrograms of luc plasmid DNA , 10 pg of zH3M- $ -gal as an internal control , and 15 pg of herring sperm DNA in 50 ul of 1/10 TE were added to the cell suspension in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette ( BioRad ) .
The cells and plasmids were then preincubated for 10 min at room temperature .
Transfection of THP-1 cells was carried out by electroporation with a BioRad gene pulser at 300 V and 250 uF .
Transfection of HL-60 cells was conducted at 300 V and 500 uF .
Cuvettes were allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature after transfection .
The cells were then transferred to 10 ml of F12 containing 10 % FBS and incubated at 37°C in a CO ; incubator .
Luciferase and -galactosidase assays Twenty-four ( for HL-60 cells ) or forty-eight hours ( for THP 111 1 cells ) after transfection , cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
The cells were then lysed in lysis solution ( 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.8 , 0.2 % Triton X-100 , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) and the luciferase activity was assayed using a PicaGene kit ( Toyo ink ) .
$ -galactosidase activity in cell extracts , which had been preheated at 48°C for 50 minutes to inactivate endogenous $ -galactosidase activity ( 65 ) , was measured by a Galacto-Light chemiluminescent reporter assay kit ( Tropix , Inc. ) in order to normalize the transfection efficiency in each experiment ( 21 ) .
Western blot analysis Nuclear extracts were prepared from HL-60 , THP U-937 , and ML-1 cells and after being subjected to SDS-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) under reduced condi-tions , were electrotransfered to a PVDF membrane , Trans-Blot ( BioRad ) .
The membrane was treated with the anti-C/EBP / or -a antibody , or normal rabbit serum followed by alkaline phosphatase immunostaining with NBT ( nitro blue tetrazolium ) and BCIP ( 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phos-phate ) .
RESULTS Expression of MRP14 in human monocytic leukemia cells We examined the mRNA expression in human monocytic leukemia cell lines and peripheral blood leukocytes by Northern blot analysis using MRP14 , MRPS8 and S-actin cDNA as probes ( Fig .
1 ) .
MRP14 mRNA was not expressed in HL-60 cells but was induced in the cells after VD ; treatment , as previously described ( 23 , 24 ) .
No MRP14 mRNA was also detected either in ML-1 or U-937 cells , while THP-1 cells constitutively expressed the mRNA ( Fig .
1A ) .
Its level in THP-1 cells was 54 % of that in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells according to the scanning by a densitometer .
The pattern of MRP8 mRNA expression was identical with that of MRP 14 ( Fig .
1B ) .
A nuclear factor of C/EBP family binds to the 5 -up-stream region of MRP14 gene To examine the transcriptional regulation of MRP14 gene , we surveyed the DNA sequence of the known regulatory elements in the 5-upstream region ( -400 to +50 ) of the MRP14 gene ( 25 ) , and the putative binding sites for three transcription factors ( IRF-1 half-site , Spl , and C/EBP ) were found ( Fig .
2A ) .
In order to investigate which transcription factor is involved in the induction of MRP14 in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells , two DNA fragments [ -400 to -=150 ( £251 fragment ) and -149 to +50 ( £199 fragment ) ] were prepared as probes and we performed competition gel shift experiments using an oligonucleotide containing the IRF-1 ( half-site ) , Sp1 , or C/EBP binding elements ( Table 1 ) .

Northern blot hybridization of MRP-14 and -8 mRNA in human leukemia and peripheral blood cells .
Total cellular RNA extracted from untreated and VD ; -treated ( day 2 ) HL-60 cells , and THP-1 , U-937 , ML-1 cells , monocytes , and neutrophils was hybridized with ( A ) MRP14 cDNA probe , ( B ) MRP8 cDNA probe , and ( C ) B-actin cDNA probe .
An excess amount of a 20-mer oligonucleotide containing the IRF-1 half-sites could not compete with the binding of nuclear factors to the £251 probe ( Fig .
2B ) , indicating that no factor bound to the region from -235 to -216 with the IRF-1 half-sites in the differentiated HL-60 cells .
On the other hand , the binding to the £199 probe was competed for by the 20-mer oligonucleotide containing the C/EBP binding motif , but not by the oligonucleotide containing the Spl motif ( Fig .
2C ) , suggesting that a factor of C/EBP family binds to £199 .
Differential binding of C/EBP } in HL-60 and C/EBP a in THP cells to the C/EBP motif in the 5-upstream region of the MRP14 gene To further characterize the nuclear factors , the 20-mer oligonucleotide with the C/EBP element ( C/EBP probe ) instead of £199 was used as a probe in the gel shift assay .
Nuclear extracts from HL-60 cells treated with VD ; , for indicated days were incubated with the C/EBP probe ( Fig .
3A ) .
The nuclear factor that bound to the C/EBP probe did not exist in the nuclei of untreated HL-60 cells , but was detected in the nuclei of HL-60 cells one day after the VD ; treatment .
The factor was most abundant in the nuclei on day 3 and had decreased greatly by day 6 , indicating that this factor is 112 R. Kuruto-Niwa et al .

However , the nucleoprotein complex in THP -1 cells was supershifted by an anti-C/EBPa antibody instead of an anti-C/EBP $ antibody .
These results indicated that the complex contains C/EBP/ # in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells and C/EBPa in THP-1 cells .
In U-937 cells , which did not express MRP14 ( Fig .
1A ) , weak shifted band was detected and the formation was inhibited by an anti-C/EBPa antibody ( data not shown ) .
No nuclear complex was found in ML-1 cells ( data not shown ) .
Transcriptional activity of the C/EBP binding motif in the MRP14 gene To characterize the transcriptional activity of the C/EBP binding motif , luc plasmid DNA was transfected into HL-60 cells treated with or without VD ; , and THP-1 cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
We preliminarily tested the transfection efficiencies of zH3M-GFP into HL-60 and THP-1 cells , since HL-60 cells are suspected to have a low transfection efficiency ( 38 ) .
zH3M-GFP , which includes a visual reporter , GFP ( 7 ) , was poorly trans- 113 fected by electroporation into HL-60 cells compared with THP -1 cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
The poor transfection of HL-60 cells was also shown by the S-galactosidase assay using the construct ( data not shown ) .
However , the addition of serum ( 10 % ) to the electroporation medium improved the transfection efficiency of HL-60 cells up to 10 % of that of THP cells ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the following luciferase assays of THP -1 cells were performed in serum-free electroporation medium , whereas that of HL-60 cells was done in the presence of 10 % serum .
The results of the luciferase activity in HL-60 cells were indicated in Fig .
5A .
We constructed the p1000 ( -C/EBP ) -luc that was defective in the C/EBP binding motif , in order to examine the function of the motif by comparison with p1000-luec .
The luc activity of p1000 ( -C/EBP ) -lue was decreased compared with that of p1000-luc [ Fig .
5A¥ ( a ) ] , suggesting that the C/EBP motif was a positive functional regulatory region in the expression of the MRP14 gene .
In VD ; -treated HL-60 cells , the luc activity of p1000-lue was approximately 1.5-fold greater than in the untreated cells .
To further characterize the involvement of the C/EBP motif , single and multimerized , wild type or mutated C/EBP oligonucleotides were fused in the ordinary ( sense ) or Fig .

Bar=100 wm .
opposite direction ( antisense ) to p73-luc construct , and the luciferase activity was assayed [ Fig .
5A¥ ( b ) ] .
The p73-luc plasmid that was fused with a single copy of the sense C/EBP motif ( C/EBP-p73-luc ) in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells had 3- to 4-fold higher activity than that in the untreated cells , and 5-fold higher activity than p73-luc ( without the C/EBP motif ) in the VD ; -treated cells .
Similar results were obtained by the insertion of an antisense copy .
Introduction of a two-base pair mutation in either C/EBP motif lowered the luc activity in both cells .
Three copies of the wild type sense C/EBP oligonucleotide increased the activity to approximately 3-fold by VD ; treatment , and 8-fold that of the p73-luc in the VD ; -treated cells .
However , three copies of the antisense C/EBP motif as well as the mutation had no so stimulatory effect .
In untreated HL-60 cells , the C/EBP motif raised the luciferase activity to a certain extent ( Fig .
5A ) .
It might be due to the artificial event that with low affinity showed the activity by the transfection of multicopy DNA , because C/EBP # was 114 R. Kuruto-Niwa et al .
detected in untreated HL-60 cells by Western blot analysis as described below ( Fig .
6 ) .
The luc activity of p1000-lue was a half of that of C/EBP-p73-lue in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells , suggesting that there might be silencer elements in the other region except the C/EBP motif in the MRP 14 gene .
Fig .
5B showed the results in THP-1 cells .
The lue activity of p1000 ( -C/EBP ) -lue was decreased compared with that of p1000-luc [ Fig .
5B ( a ) ] .
The activity of C/EBP-p73-luc was 3- to 4-fold greater than that of p73-luc [ Fig .
5B ( b ) ] .
Moreover , three copies of the wild type sense C/EBP motif increased the activity to approximately 10-fold that of the p73-luc in THP -1 cells .
These data demonstrated that the C/EBP binding motif was the functional regulatory region of the MRP14 gene in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells and THP -1 cells .
Expression of C/EBP / # in human monocytic leukemia cells We investigated the nuclear expression of C/EBP in human monocytic leukemia cell lines by Western blot analysis with the anti-C/EBP/ # antibody ( Fig .
6 ) .
The antibody stained discrete two protein bands with molecular masses of 46 and 44 kDa ; the 44 kDa band was stained much stronger by the antibody .
These two proteins are considered to be derived from the first two AUG codons of mRNA ( 1 , 60 ) .
The intensity of the two signals did not significantly change in HL-60 cells after VD ; treatment ( Fig .
6 ) .
was strongly expressed in all cell lines except for ML-1 cells .
However , C/EBP } in the nuclei of untreated HL-60 cells and THP cells could not bind to the C/EBP motif in the MRP14 gene ( Fig .
3 , A , C ) .
With the anti-C/EBPa antibody , no specific band appeared in either cell by the Western blot analysis ( data not shown ) .
No band was detected with normal rabbit serum ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION We examined MRP expression in human monocytic leukemia cells .
The MRP genes were not expressed in monoblastic ML-1 cells and promonocytic U-937 cells as well as promyelocytic HL-60 cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Other investigators have reported that MRPs are expressed in U-937 cells ( 25 , 49 ) .
The discrepancy is probably due to variations of U-937 phenotype under different culture conditions .
On the other hand , monocytic THP ( 58 ) and VD ; -treated HL-60 cells expressed the MRP genes , but with differential levels ( Fig .
1 ) .
Thus , it is apparent that MRP genes are expressed at the post promonocytic stage in monocytic differentiation and the VD ; treatment induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells beyond the promonocytic stage .

The values are means of three independent experiments ; error sentation of each luc reporter construct is shown on the left .
( a ) p1000-luc single and three copies , wild type or mutated C/EBP oligonucleotides .
factors to the cis-element of a gene can promote the initiation of transcription of the gene ( 15 , 54 ) .
To investigate the transcriptional factors regulating the MRP14 gene expression , we performed gel-shift competition assay using two probes , £251 ( -400 to -150 ) and £199 ( - 149 to +50 ) in the 5'-upstream region of the MRP 14 gene .
A retarded complex shown in Fig .
2C , lane 1 , which had been faintly detected and neglected in the previous study ( 24 ) , was clearly detected in the current study and was competed with a C/EBP-specific oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2C , lane 4 ) .
Therefore , we re-evalu-ated the factor that bound to the C/EBP motif and further studied in the following experiments .
A retarded 115 bars represent standard deviations of the means .
A schematic repre-and p1000 ( -C/EBP ) -luc construct .
( b ) p73-lue and p73-lue fused with band close to the free £199 probe has been designated MP14FII in the previous report ( 24 ) .
In this study , however , the band was not consistently detected , and we concluded that MP1I4FII was a false-negative .
In the previous gel shift assay , we designated a factor in the nuclei of HL-60 cells that retarded the £251 probe ( Fig .
2B ) as MP14FI ( 24 ) , which was also present in THP -1 cells ( data not shown ) .
MP14FT did not bind to the IRF-1 half-sites , since the retardation of £251 by MP14FI was not affected by the addition of the competitor with the IRF-1 half-sites ( Fig .
2B ) .
Therefore , it is essential to determine where MPI4FI binds in the £251 fragment in future experiments .

- Western blot analysis of C/EBP in human leukemia cells .
Nuclear extracts were prepared for the detection of C/EBPS from HL-60 cells treated with VD ; for 0 , 1 , and 3 days , and from THP-1 , U-937 , and ML-1 cells .
Blotted membrane was immunostained with an anti-C/EBP / antibody .
The C/EBP-specific binding was further studied by the use of a C/EBP -specific oligonucleotide as a probe in the gel-shift assay ( Fig .
3 ) .
The binding factor which is VD ; differentiation-dependent in HL-60 cells ( Fig .
3A ) was immunologically identified as C/EBP $ , whereas C/EBP a bound to the same C/EBP motif in THP-1 cells ( Fig .
3C ) .
C/EBPa , previously termed C/EBP , was identified originally as a heat-stable , sequence-specific DNA-bind-ing activity present in soluble extracts of rat liver nuclei ( 26 ) and is characterized as a factor involved in cell differentiation and energy metabolism ( 28 , 50 , 53 , 61 ) .
Several isoforms , such as C/EBP # , -7 , -8 , -£ and CHOP 10 , have been identified , and they are known as the C/EBP family ( 1 , 2 , 10 , 26 , 41 , 54 ) .
These members can cross-dimerize and bind to DNA with similar specificity ( 1 , 6 , 37 , 41 , 64 ) .
C/EBP } is known to regulate a number of cytokine genes and may contribute to normal myeloid development as well as to activation of mature myeloid cells in response to an inflammatory stimulus ( 1 , 31 , 39 , 52 , 53 , 59 ) .
Furthermore , the expression of C/EBP & increases during differentiation towards granulocytes as well as macrophages ( 31 , 48 ) .
The differential binding of C/EBPa and - $ in our study may be important in the regulation of MRPI14 expression since the level of MRP14 mRNA in THP-1 cells was half that in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells ( Fig .
1A ) .
Pope et al .
reported that C/EBP } was a stronger acti-vator of the TNFa promoter than C/EBP a ( 39 ) .
It was also reported that C/EBPa attenuated the transcriptional activation by C/EBP # ( 36 ) .
The transcriptional activities of the C/EBP binding motif were functional and showed similar patterns in VD ; -treated HL-60 and THP-1 cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
It is possible that C/EBP synergistically interact with other transcription factors , which may bind to other promoter regions in the MRP14 gene , for example , an unknown factor that bound to the £251 fragment .
It is known that C/EBP # 116 R. Kuruto-Niwa et al .
interacts with NF-4B , glucocorticoid receptor , and retinoblastoma protein ( 8 , 27 , 33 ) , and that C/EBPa asso-ciliates with TFIIB , TATA-binding protein , and AML ( acute myelogenous leukemia ) -1 ( 32 , 67 ) .
The differential activity of C/EBP isoforms may be caused by distinct interactions with other proteins ( 37 ) .
We would like to examine the other negative or positive factors involved in MRP 14 expression .
It was reported that no C/EBP } mRNA was detected in untreated HL-60 and U-937 cells ( 31 ) .
In this study , however , C/EBP # was detected in these cells by Western blot analysis ( Fig .
6 ) .
This discrepancy may also due to different cell culture conditions as discussed above .
We found that the DNA binding activity of C/EBP } appeared in HL-60 cells after VD ; treatment with little change in C/EBP # level .
Other investigators similarly reported that DNA binding activity of C/EBP & # increased after stimulation , whereas the amount of remained unchanged , suggesting that was activated through post-translational modification ( 1 , 60 ) .
Similar post-translational modifi cation of C/EBP # may occur in VD ; -treated HL-60 cells .
Several investigators have reported that C/EBP # is activated through phosphorylation by calcium/cal-modulin-dependent protein kinase ( 62 ) , mitogen-activated kinase ( 30 ) , protein kinase C ( 56 , 57 ) , or protein kinase A ( 57 ) .
It was also reported that the association with c-Fos or with c-Jun altered the DNA binding specificity of C/EBP and reduced its binding ( 19 ) .
Further studies will be needed to identify any modification in the HL-60 cells .
