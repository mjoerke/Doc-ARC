Communication Nitric Oxide-stimulated Guanine Nucleotide Exchange on p21 '' `` ** ( Received for publication , December 30 , 1994 , and in revised form , February 1 , 1995 ) Harry M. Lander # § , Jason S. Ogiste ? t , S. Frieda A. Pearce , Roberto Levit , and Abraham Novogrodsky|** From the { Department of Pharmacology and Medicine , Division of Hematology / Oncology , Cornell University Medical College , New York , New York 10021 , the Felsenstein Medical Research Center , Beilinson Campus , Petah-Tikva 49100 , Israel , and the **Sackler School of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv 69978 , Israel The protooncogene p21 `` , a monomeric G protein family member , plays a critical role in converting extra-cellular signals into intracellular biochemical events .
Here , we report that nitric oxide ( NO ) activates p21l ' `` * in human T cells as evidenced by an increase in GTP bound p21 '' .
In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21 '' demonstrate that the activation is direct and re-versible .
Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21 * '' '' in association with GDP/GTP exchange .
The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that p21 '' is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling , such as NF-KB activation , and that endogenous NO can activate p21 `` '' in the same cell .
These studies identify p21 '' ** as a target of NO in T cells and suggest that NO activates p21 '' by an action which mimics that of guanine nucleotide exchange factors .
Reactive oxygen species are known to mediate signal transduction events in lymphocytes ( 1-3 ) and have recently been implicated in the signaling process of a wide range of stimuli ( 4 ) .
The reactive nitrogen species , nitric oxide ( NO ) , !
plays critical roles in many diverse biological processes such as vasoregulation , host defense and synaptic plasticity ( 5-8 ) .
Recently , we identified a role for NO as a positive signaling molecule in the immune system ( 9 , 10 ) .
The protooncogene p21 ** has been identified as a key molecular switch involved in regulating T cell activation triggered by various mitogens ( 11-13 ) .
Therefore , we hypothesized that the immune stimulatory properties of NO may be mediated through p21 '' , and thus we examined whether NO could activate p21 ** in human T cells .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide gas were purchased from Matheson Gas , East Rutherford , NJ ; [ y-°°P ] IGTP and PO ; were from Amersham Corp. ; p21 '' ** antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotech-nology , Santa Cruz , CA ; and all other biochemicals were from Sigma .
Purified , recombinant p21 '' ** was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Manor , Department of Pharmacology , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY .
Cell Culture-The human T cell line , Jurkat , was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5 % CO , .
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HU-VEC ) were kindly provided by Dr. Steven S. Gross , Department of Pharmacology , Cornell University Medical College , New York , NY and PC12 mutant cells by Dr. G. Cooper , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA .
Quantitation of p21 ' % ®-associated Nucleotides-The assay used to measure the GTP/GDP ratio on immunoprecipitated p21 '' ** was essentially that of Downward et ol .
( 11 ) .
Jurkat T cells ( 4 X 10° cells/ml ! )
were labeled in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 200 mCi/ml *°POz for 16 h. NO , prepared as described previously ( 10 ) , was added directly to 1 ml of sample for the indicated time after which cells were analyzed for the percentage of GTP-bound p21 ' '' '' * .
Anti-p21 '' '' ®-agarose ( clone Y13-259 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was added for immunoprecipitation .
After elution of guanine nucleotides , 5 ul of sample was spotted onto polyethyleneimine TLC plates , run for 3 h in 0.75 m KH , PO , ( pH 3.4 ) and exposed to phosphorimaging screens overnight .
Spots migrating with the same R , as GDP or GTP standards were quantified using a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
The percent of GTP bound to p21 * was calculated using the following formula which takes into account the extra phosphate on GTP as compared with GDP : ( % x GTPY/ ( GDP + % x GTP ) .
Control samples had non-immune IgG + protein A-agarose added rather than anti-p21 ' '' '' , and no GDP or GTP spots were evident .
GTPase Assay-The GTPase assay was performed exactly as we previously described ( 10 ) .
Carbon monoxide was prepared as a saturated solution with a concentration of 1 mM ( 14 ) , in a similar manner as NO solutions ( 10 ) .
PHJGDP Release Assay-p23V ® ( 1 pM ) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 200 ul of GDP binding buffer ( 20 mm Tris , pH 7.4 , 1 mm MgCl , , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 100 mM NaCl , 0.1 mg/ml BSA , and 100 pmol of [ °HJGDP ( 10 Ci/mmol ) .
Then , 20 pl of 5 mM GTP was added with any test reagents .
After incubation for the required time at 30 °C , 40-ul aliquots were removed and bound [ °HJGDP was separated from free by washing with 20 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , 100 mm NaCl , and 25 mm MgCl , on nitrocellulose filters .
The filters were dried and counted in a liquid scintillation counter .
Binding Assay-The y-*°S-GTP binding assay was performed exactly as described ( 15 ) , except that 100 nM y-S-GTP was added to modify the specific activity of radiolabeled probe .
Assay of Nitrosothiol Content-Samples of p21 '' ** were exposed to NO ( 50 pM ) for 10 min prior to analysis of nitrosothiol content by a coloro-metric method ( 16 ) .
Samples containing either NO , p21 '' , or IgG alone had no detectable nitrosothiol .
S-Nitroso-N-acetylpeniciliamine ( 10-1000 uM ) was used as a standard .
Circular Dichroism Spectral Analysis-Circular dichroism spectral analysis was performed at 22 °C in 0.1-mm cuvettes in a Jasco 710 CD spectrophotometer .
Samples were dissolved in 50 mM Tris buffer , pH 7.4 , and measured with a 0.2-nm bandwidth , a 0.2 nm step scan , and varying scan speeds of 60-200 nm/min .
NO ( 50 um ) was added to p21 '' ** ( 17 pM ) , and spectral characteristics measured over varying time periods indicated that p21 ' '' * '' and the p21 '' '' *-NO complex remained stable for the duration of the data collection period .
The spectra were analyzed using the LINCOMB program ( Dr. G. D. Fasman , Brandeis University , Waltham , MA ) .
NF- « B Gel Shift Assay-Nuclei from PC12 cells were isolated and assayed for NF-kB binding activity as we described previously ( 9 , 10 ) .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Effects of NO on p21 Enzymology-In its resting state , p21 '' ** has GDP bound .
Upon in vivo activation , p21 '' releases GDP and binds GTP ( 17-20 ) .

1 , Effect of NO on p21 '' activation in Jurkat T cells .
The human Jurkat T cell line was stimulated with various amounts of NO for 10 min ( A ) or with NO ( 0.01 um ) for various times ( B ) .
At the appropriate times , cells were washed , p21 '' '' '' was immunoprecipitated , and the bound nucleotides analyzed .
Data are expressed as the percentage of GTP-bound p21 ** of control .
Control samples had a base line value of 12.4 + 3.6 % GTP bound .
Data represent the mean and standard deviation from four to six experiments .
measured the ratio of GTP/GDP on p21 '' in Jurkat cells ( a human T cell line ) in which the nucleotide pools were labeled with °°PO ; .
As seen in Fig .
14 , immunoprecipitation of p21 ' '' ** reveals a substantial increase in the percentage of GTP bound upon NO treatment .
The curve is biphasic with a maximal effect at 10 nm , although higher concentrations of NO yielded levels of GTP-p21 '' * '' that were above base line values .
The kinetics of p21 ** activation ( Fig .
1B ) is of short duration and more similar to that seen upon growth factor receptor stimulation of neural cells than that of T cells ( 11 , 21 , 22 ) .
The relatively short duration of the NO-induced signal may be due to the interaction of activated p21 ° with its effector and/or GTPase-activating proteins .
Alternatively , this stimulation may be transient and therefore not lead to a fully activated phenotype .
The activating effect of NO could be mediated either by direct interaction with p21 '' ** or indirectly through additional factors .
Therefore , we mixed NO with pure recombinant p21 ** in vitro and measured its intrinsic GTPase activity .
Surprisingly , NO enhanced the GTPase activity of p21 in vitro , indicating a direct effect ( Fig .
24 ) .

Effect of NO and carbon monoxide on p21 '' enzymatic activity in vitro .
Pure recombinant p21 '' * '' was incubated with various concentrations of NO or CO for 10 min ( 4 ) after which p21 `` * GTPase activity was measured .
p21 '' preloaded with [ °H ] JGDP , or GDP-loaded p21 mixed with y-*°S-GTP , was treated with various amounts of NO for 10 min at 37 °C followed by assay of bound [ °HJGDP or y-*°S-GTP ( B ) .
Data represent the mean and standard deviation from three to seven experiments .
unitsm1l ) or superoxide dismutase ( 30 units/ml ) had no effect on the /ability of NO to enhance p21 '' ** GTPase activity ( data not shown ) , indicating that the activating species is not hydroxyl radical , superoxide , or peroxynitrite .
The amount of NO which gives a maximal response ( 75 um ) in vitro is much higher than that required in whole cells ( 0.01 um , Fig .
14 ) .
We have observed previously a similar differential sensitivity in leukocyte membranes treated with NO before or after isolation using a membrane GTPase assay ( 10 ) .
This phenomenon may be due to a cellular component which makes NO more potent and is lacking in purified preparations .
These are likely to be oxidizing conditions which favor formation of nitrosonium ion ( NO¢ ) and facilitate nitrosothiol formation ( 23-25 ) .
In contrast to NO , carbon monoxide , another gas claimed to be a signaling molecule in the brain ( 26 , 27 ) , had no effect on p21 * activity ( Fig .
24 ) .
The apparent increase in GTPase activity could be due to either : 1 ) an increase in GDP release from p21 '' * '' ( the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle ) or 2 ) an increase in the intrinsic GTPase activity of p21 '' .
In vivo , GDP release is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF ) , and represents activation , whereas GTP hydrolysis is controlled by GTPase-activating proteins and represents inactivation ( 17 Nitric Oxide Signaling through p21 Hb before NO Hb after NO > l 2 & | pie 1 < o i 3 ag-f 150 i & 0 ( Eoul I 0 G | 10 i - 1 § | I 1 l N0 : -o ¢ t - + + Hb : - - 4+ + -o q B { Z2 R-SNO Formation ( mol/me ! )

Effect of hemoglobin and the influence of blocking antibodies on p21 '' * '' activity and nitrosothiol formation .
Hb ( 0.4 mM ) was added before or 10 min after NO ( 100 um ) addition ( 4 ) .
In antibody blocking experiments , 10 ug of the indicated antibody was incubated with 1 um p21 '' for 30 min at 22 °C followed by NO ( 50 uM ) addition and GTPase assay or nitrosothiol assay .
Data represent the mean and standard deviation of three experiments .
The asterisk denotes no detectable nitrosothiols ( i.e .
less than 0.2 mol/mol ) .
20 ) .
To distinguish between these possibilities , we preloaded p2V * with [ PHJGDP and tested whether NO increased GDP release .
As seen in Fig .
2B , concentrations of NO which enhance GTPase activity ( Fig .
24 ) induced GDP release from p21 '' * '' .
Furthermore , at concentrations of NO where [ °H ] JGDP was released , y-*°S-GTP was bound ( Fig .
2B ) .
These data support our findings of an increase in the GTP/GDP ratio on p21 '' ** in whole cells ( Fig .
1A ) and verify the concept that NO is an activator of p21 '' by promoting guanine nucleotide exchange .
Studies on Mechanism-Hemoglobin ( Hb ) has a high affinity for NO and can thus prevent most of its biological actions by complexing with it ( 23 , 28 ) .
As expected , we found that Hb prevented NO from activating p21 '' when added prior to NO ( Fig .
3A ) .
Interestingly , when Hb was added 10 min after NO addition , p21 '' activation was reversed whereas Hb by itself had no effect on activity ( Fig .
34 ) .
A reversible activation of p21 ' '' ** by NO implies that either NO is acting allosterically or that it reversibly and covalently modifies an enzyme site .
Of note , nitrosothiols are known to be reversibly nitrosated in the presence of Hb ( 23 , 28 ) .
Release of GDP is effected by GEF 's which bind to regions on p21 '' that can be blocked by the monoclonal antibody Y13-259 ( 29 , 30 ) .
To determine if NO induces GDP release in a manner similar to GEF 's , we examined whether preincubation of p21 '' ** with Y13-259 prevents NO activation .
As seen in Fig .
3B , antibody Y13-259 substantially prevented the ability of NO to activate p21 '' ** .
In contrast , monoclonal antibody Y13-238 , which binds to a different region on the molecule ( 31 ) , had no effect ( Fig .
3B ) .
These data suggest that NO induces GDP 7019 1 '' which normally release by interacting with a region of p2 interacts with GEK 's ( 32 , 33 ) .
Because p21 ' '' ** does not contain a heme group , and Hb reversed the activation by NO , we examined the possibility that the mechanism of activation was via formation of a nitrosothiol ( Fig .
3B ) .
We found that NO induced the formation of only one nitrosothiol on p21 '' , even though p21 ' '' ** contains 5 Cys resi-dues .
Importantly , the antibody Y13-259 , which prevented activation of p21 ' '' * '' by NO , also prevented nitrosothiol formation , whereas the control antibody Y13-238 , which did not prevent activation , also did not prevent nitrosothiol formation ( Fig .
3B ) .
Furthermore , Hg '' * , a known thiol-reactive reagent , enhanced p21 '' GTPase activity ( data not shown ) .
These data strongly suggest that formation of a nitrosothiol on p21 ** by NO is responsible for activation .
To examine if NO causes a conformational alteration in p21 '' , we used circular dichroism ( CD ) spectral analysis to assess secondary structure .
Treatment of p21 ** with NO led to a dramatic change in its CD spectral properties , and computer analysis revealed a profound reduction in a-helical content ( from 60 to 36 % ) and a concomitant increase in B-sheet content ( from 18 to 44 % ) .
The basal spectra we obtained for untreated p21 ** were identical to that published previously ( 34 ) .
These data suggest that NO induces a conformational change in p21 '' * '' concomitant upon nitrosothiol formation , leading to enhanced nucleotide exchange .
Downstream Signaling-Previous data from our laboratory have broadened the spectrum of NO action to include an immune stimulatory component ( 9 , 10 ) .
In those studies a G protein inhibitor , GDPBS , blocked NO-induced NF- « B transcription factor activation in human lymphocytes .
Although those findings implicated ( G proteins as transducers of NO signals , exactly which G proteins were involved was unclear .
Here , we examined whether NO could activate NF-KB in cells harboring a mutant , inactive p21 ® ( 35 ) .
As seen in Fig .
4 , upper panel , wild type parental cells responded to sodium ni-troprusside by translocating NF-B to the nucleus .
In contrast , the p21 '' **-defective cells did not respond to sodium nitroprus-side .
Thus , p21 '' * is necessary for NO-induced cellular activation signals .
Others have found that PC12 cells expressing a dominant negative mutation in p21 '' no longer respond to tumor necrosis factor-a and UV light by activating NF-kB ( 36 ) .
These free radical generators ( 4 ) were proposed to act upstream of `` .
Our data suggest that reactive nitrogen species , and therefore possibly reactive oxygen species , directly activate p21 , leading to subsequent downstream events such as NF- « B translocation .
The physiological relevance of our findings are strengthened by our demonstration that endogenous NO activates p21 `` ( Fig .
4 , lower panel ) .
We induced nitric oxide synthesis in HUVEC with LPS and IFN-y ( 37 ) .
We found that in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor `` N-methyl-L-argi-nine , providing a pulse of the substrate , L-arginine ( to avoid the desensitization effect found in Fig .
1B ) , led to recovery of an activated form of p21 '' ( Fig .
4 , lower panel ) .
Thus , an auto-crine loop may exist within cells , whereby endogenous NO activates cellular p21 , leading to cell activation and nitric oxide synthase transcriptional regulation .
NO is a highly reactive gas which can be generated in high local concentrations at sites of inflammation .
Thus , our findings suggest that activation of p21 * by NO is likely to be a major mechanism of amplification of leukocyte-induced local tissue damage .
The present findings identify p21 '' ** as a target of NO in T cells .
We propose that NO , via formation of a nitrosothiol , leads to a conformational change which enhances guanine nucleotide 7020 A wt ( ras+ ) mt ( ras- ) SNP ( uM ) : 0 1 10 0 1 10 NF - KB B so - it `` % No Addition fos IFN-y x* 40 0 U L. YC - 30 4 OO Q ere Q i— J ip .

Role of p21 '' '' * in NO signaling .
Upper panel , parental PC12 wild type ( wt ) or ras-negative ( mt ) cells were serum-starved overnight and then treated with the indicated concentration of sodium nitroprus-side ( SNP ) , an NO-generating compound , for 4 h followed by nucleus isolation and assay for NF-kB binding activity .
The arrow denotes migration of the NF- « kB/DNA complex .
Lower panel , HUVECs were either untreated or treated 16 h with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , 30 ug/ ml ) and interferon-y ( IFN-y , 50 ng/ml ) or `` N-methyl-L-arginine ( NMA ) ( 3 mm ) in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 100 mCi/ml *°PO ; .
Then , indicated wells were treated with L-arginine ( ARG , 10 mm ) for 15 min and samples assayed for GTP-bound p21 '' .
exchange , thus mimicking endogenous GEF 's .
The ability of NO to activate p21 '' * '' , a non-heme enzyme , represents a novel signal transduction pathway .
Furthermore , because nitrosothiol formation on a critical cysteine is apparently responsible for its activation , p21 '' may be ideally suited to transduce other oxidative stress signals from both endogenous and exog-enous sources in many cell types .
In fact , others have found that redox agents modulate binding of GTP to p21 ' '' ** immuno-precipitates ( 38 ) .
Furthermore , the activation of p21 ' '' ** or other monomeric G proteins by NO may not be restricted to T cells and conceivably could mediate many signals transmitted by NO , such as Ca**-independent vesicle exocytosis ( 39 ) and synaptic plasticity in the brain ( 8 , 40 ) .
Heterotrimeric G proteins may also be a target of NO as the G , , subunits are highly homologous to p21 '' ( 18 ) .
For example G proteins are known to Nitric Oxide Signaling through p21'® mediate olfaction , and NO has recently been implicated in this sytem ( 41 ) .
