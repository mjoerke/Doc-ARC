Inhibition of Nuclear Factor « B Activation Attenuates Apoptosis Resistance in Lymphoid Cells By | .

Debatin Death-inducing ligands ( DILs ) such as tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa ) or the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin have been show n to activate a nuclear factor « B program that may rescue cells from apoptosis induction .
We demonstrate here that TRAIL ( TNF-related apoptosis-inducing li-gand ) , a recently identified DIL , also activates NFkB in lymphoid cell lines in a kinetic similar to TNFa .
NFB activity is independent from FADD , caspases , and apoptosis induction .
To study the influence of NFkB activity on apoptosis mediated by TRAIL , CD95 , TNFa , or doxorubicin , NFkB activation was inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor ESISTANCE OF TUMOR cells towards induction of apoptosis is a main reason for failure of anticancer treatment. ! ''
Recent studies suggest that Nuclear factor « kB ( NFB ) may mediate a survival pathway in many cells . ''
In the present study , we suggest that inhibition of NFB activation may decrease apoptosis resistance for death-inducing ligands ( DILs ) and cytostatic drugs in lymphoid cells .
NFB is a DNA binding protein that augments transcription of various genes involved in cell proliferation , such as growth factors . ''
NFB plays an important role for cell development , * survival , and oncogenesis , '' eg , in the immune system , '' and mediates its function through homodimers or heterodimers formed by family members ( RelA/p65 , RelB , c-rel , NFKkB1/ p50 , and NFKkB2/p52 ) .© In quiescent cells , cytosolic NFB is bound to inhibitory IxB-proteins .
`` > '' Upon activation , IxB becomes phosphorylated , ubiquitinated , and subsequentially degraded by proteasomes , '' enabling nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of activated NFB . ''
A variety of different stimuli activate NFB , such as oxida-tive stress , cytokines , and apoptosis-inducing stimuli including drugs used in anticancer treatment .
'* ' '' Most importantly , direct triggering of death receptors , eg , by tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa ) , may activate a NFB dependent pathway that antagonizes apoptosis .
Induction of apoptosis by TNFa involves signaling through adapter molecules such as FADD that bind to the intracellular death domain of the respective receptor via TRADD to activate downstream caspases and apoptosis effec-tors .
In contrast , activation of NFB seems to be the consequence of a pathway that is independent from FADD-mediated From the Division of Molecular Oncology , Deutsches Krebsfor-schungszentrum , Heidelberg , Germany ; the Department of Physiology , University Munich , Germany ; the Institut filr Medizinische Strahlen-kunde und Zellforschung , University Wiirzburg , Germany ; and the University Childrens ' Hospital , Ulm , Germany .

Sensitivity for induction of apoptosis was markedly increased by these treatments in apoptosis sensitive cell lines .
Moreover , both in cell lines and in primary leukemia cells that are resistant towards induction of apoptosis by DILs and doxorubicin , antagonization of NFB activity partially restored apoptosis sensitivity .
These data suggest that inhibition of NFB activation may provide a molecular approach to increase apoptosis sensitivity in anticancer treatment .

* TNFa activates NFB in a broad spectrum of cells and activation of NFB was shown to modify induction of apoptosis . '' '' '' ''
Thus , in RelA -/- cells ' '' or cells overexpressing IxB , '' '' induction of apoptosis by TNFa is markedly enhanced .
Apart from TNFa , two additional DILs are characterized so far , all members of the TNF superfamily : CD95-ligand ( CD95-L ) and TRAIL ( TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ) .
CD95-L activates NFB in a cell-type-specific manner and independently from its cytotoxic function .
'** ' Recently , a new DIL was found , TRAIL , ** > ** that mediates apoptosis by its receptors DR4/TRAIL-R1/TRICK1*® '' and DRS/TRAIL-R2 TRICK2 , '' * > ' eg , in leukemic cells . ''
We report here that TRAIL activates NFB in lymphoid cell lines .
Inhibition of NFB activation strongly increases apoptosis sensitivity in some cell lines .
In addition , we found that inhibition of NFB activation enables induction of apoptosis by several DILs as well as cytostatic drugs in cells that are cross-resistant for apoptosis induction by DILs and drugs .

4625 RESULTS Activation of NFB by TRAIL .
We used electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) to investigate whether TRAIL is able to activate NFB in lymphoid cells .
As shown in Fig 1A , enhanced NFB binding activity was found as early as 10 minutes after stimulation of Jurkat cells with TRAIL ( 0.3 ug/mL ) .

4626 comparable with stimulation of Jurkat cells with PMA/ Tonomycin ( Fig 1A ) .
Activation of NFB by TRAIL was also observed in CEM cells and in the murine pre-B-cell line PD31 ( data not shown ) .
TNFa also activated NFB in most cell lines tested , whereas CD95-triggering did not consistently induce NFB activation '' ( and data not shown ) .
TRAIL-induced NFB binding activity was mediated by a complex of dimers containing p50 and p65 proteins as demonstrated by supershift experiments ( data not shown ) .
NFKB activation was accompanied by degradation of its cytosolic inhibitor IxBa , which could be blocked by the proteasome inhibitor LLnL , as detected in Western blot ( Fig 1B ) .
Independence of TRAIL-mediated NFB activation from FADD and caspases .
- Because TRAIL mediates two effects , namely induction of apoptosis and activation of NFkB , we examined whether both signals use the same intracellular signaling pathway .
After stimulation with TRAIL , BJAB cells stably overexpressing a dominant negative FADD mutant protein displayed similar NFkB activation compared with mock-transfected cells , suggesting that TRAIL-mediated NFkB activation is indepedent from FADD signaling ( data not shown ) .
To test whether TRAIL-induced activation of NFB involves known downstream effector molecules for apoptosis mediated by TRAIL , we examined NFB activation in the presence of inhibition of caspase activity .
ZVAD , a broad spectrum inhibitor of caspases that is known to block TRAIL-induced apoptosis , '' had no significant influence on activation of NFB by TRAIL ( Fig 2 ) , suggesting that both intracellular signaling pathways are at least partially independent .
Increase in apoptosis sensitivity of CEM cells by inhibition of NFkB activation .
- Because the two signals mediated by TRAIL use different intracellular signaling transmission , we further examined the influence of one signal on the other , here of coactivated NFB activity on DIL and drug-induced apoptosis .
We used parental CEM cells ( Fig 3 ) and CEM-R cells , a derivative cell line resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and cross-resistant for DILs such as TRAIL ( Fig 4 ) .

JEREMIAS ET AL absence of cycloheximide .
Treatment of CEM cells with LLL in concentrations that block NFB activation ( compare Fig 2 ) strongly enhanced apoptosis induced by low doses of TRAIL ( Fig 3A ) .
This increase in apoptosis sensitivity was additionally found in the acute T-cell leukemia line Jurkat ( Fig 3B ) , the Burkitt lymphoma line BJAB ( Fig 3C ) , and in response to anti-APO-1 , TNFa , and doxorubicin ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , BJAB cells stably overexpressing a dominant negative mutant FADD protein that are resistant towards TRAIL-induced apoptosis**~ '' ° did not acquire sensitivity in the presence of LLnL , suggesting that the FADD-mediated signaling pathway is indepedent from NFkB ( Fig 3C ) .
To see more specifically whether the underlying mechanism of LLnL function is dependent on NFKB blockade , we used transient overexpression of a nondegradable IxBa mutant protein .
Cotransfection with the gene for the GFP marker protein enabled separate forward side scatter FACScan analysis of transfected cells .
Using this treatment , apoptosis induced by all three DILs was markedly enhanced in the presence of mutant IxBa in comparison to mock-transfected cells ( Fig 3D and E ) .
Abrogation of apoptosis resistance in CEM-R cells by inhibition of NFkB activation .
While inhibition of NFkB activation augments induction of apoptosis , we asked whether it would further affect apoptosis resistance .
CEM-R cells are resistant towards apoptosis mediated by doxorubicin and certain DILs .
In both cell lines , apoptosis-sensitive CEM cells and apoptosis-resistant CEM-R cells , TRAIL mediates activation of NFB comparable to activation by PMA/Ionomycin ( Fig 4A ) .
Additionally , basal NFB activity of unstimulated cells was not consistently different between CEM and CEM-R cells ( data not shown ) .
Using LLnL , CEM-R cells were clearly sensitized towards induction of apoptosis by high doses of TRAIL ( Fig 4B ) , anti-APO-1 , and TNFa ( data not shown ) .
Most importantly , LLnL also mediated sensitivity for induction of apoptosis by doxorubicin in these otherwise completely resistant cells ( Fig 4C ) .
Similarly , LLnL restored DIL and doxorubicin sensitivity in the apoptosis-resistant cell lines Jurkat-R and BOE ( data not shown ) .
Likewise , transient overexpression of mutant IxBa strongly increased apoptosis sensitivity , predominantly for TRAIL and TNFa ( Fig 4D ) .
These data suggest that inhibition of NFKB activation enables induction of apoptosis in otherwise resistant cell lines .
Attenuation of apoptosis resistance in primary leukemia cells by inhibition of NFB activation .
- To see whether our findings obtained with cell lines would be relevant for primary tumor cells , we studied bone marrow cells from 6 patients with acute leukemias .
Because of the increased spontaneous apoptosis , short-term incubations were performed .
In each case , the experiment was terminated when the percentage of spontaneous apoptosis exceeded 35 % .
Leukemic cell from all patients displayed almost complete resistance towards induction of apoptosis by DILs ex vivo .
As shown in Fig 5A , inhibition of NFxB activation by LLnL led to a strong increase in sensitivity for TRAIL induced apoptosis in 5 of 6 patient samples .
In 2 patients , we further tested apoptosis induction by additional DILs .
LLnL markedly increased apoptosis sensitivity triggered by €D95 or TNF-receptor I in both primary common ALL cells ( Fig 5B ) and primary AML cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

that the influence of inhibition of NFB activity on apoptosis resistance might be clinically relevant .
DISCUSSION In the present study , we demonstrate that inhibition of NFB activation augments DIL and drug-induced apoptosis and significantly decreases apoptosis resistance .
DILs such as CD95-L and TNFa are known to activate NFB independently of their cytotoxic function .
We show here that TRAIL also activates NFkB in lymphoid cells .
Activation of NFB by TRAIL is independent from FADD , caspases , and induction of apoptosis , suggesting that the two intracellular signaling pathways initiated by TRAIL separate at an early stage close to the receptors and upstream from Activation of NFkB by TRAIL was not found in all lymphoid cell lines sensitive for TRAIL-induced apoptosis ( data not shown ) .
Likewise , cell type specificity of TRAIL-mediated NFKB activation has also been described in some , but not all solid tumor cell lines . '' ''
However , all DILs identified so far are able to mediate at least two different signals in some cells , apoptosis and activation of NFB .
We studied the influence of NFB on induction of apoptosis using two different approaches to block NFKB activation .
LLnL disables degradation of NFB-inhibitory IxBa protein by the proteasome .
Because inhibition of proteasome function itself may have potential side effects , '' '' '' '' we performed an extensive testing for the toxicity of LLnL .

INHIBITION OF NFkB ATTENUATES APOPTOSIS RESISTANCE A * 1 Fig 5 .
Attenuation of apoptosis resistance in primary leukemia cells by inhibition of NFB activation .
( A ) Primary leukemia cells of 6 patients with acute leukemias were obtained from bone marrow at the time of diagnosis and separated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation .
Cells were treated with TRAIL ( 1 pg/mL ) in the presence or absence of LLnL ( 1 hour of preincubation , untoxic dosis , respectively , for each patient , 4 to 25 pmol/L ) for 6 to 12 hours ( spontaneous apoptosis < 35 % ) and apoptosis was measured by forward side scatter analysis in FACScan flow cytom-eter .
Data are the mean of duplicates with a standard deviation less than 10 % .
( B ) Primary bone marrow leukemia cells of a patient with common ALL were obtained as in ( A ) .
Cells were stimulated with TRAIL ( 1 pg/mL ) , anti-APO-1 ( 1 pg/mL ) in the presence of protein A ( 5 ng/mL ) , or TNFa ( 0,3 pg/mL ) for 6 hours in the presence or absence of LLnL ( 4.25 pmol/L , 1 hour of preincu-bation ) , and apoptosis was measured as in ( A ) .
Data are the mean of duplicates with a standard 0 deviation less than 10 % .
Similar results were obtained in two patients .
17,5 + specific apoptosis ( % ) specific toxicity limit of the drug ( 10 to 20 umol/L , respec-tively ) .
LLnL significantly increased induction of apoptosis by DILs and doxorubicin .
To rule out that the increase in induction of apoptosis might be due to interference of proteasome inhibitor with the cell cycle , '' a second molecular approach was performed using transfection of DNA encoding mutant IxBa protein .
The mutant IxBa protein can not be phosphorylated and subsequentially ubiquitinated , leading to inhibition of NFB activity .
Overexpression of mutant IxBa markedly increased induction of apoptosis , proving that NFB activation interferes with DIL-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells , eg , after stimulation with TRAIL .
Similar results were obtained by transient overexpression of wild-type IxBa protein ( data not shown ) .
Most importantly , inhibition of NFB activation enabled apoptosis sensitivity for all DILs in otherwise apoptosis-resistant CEM-R cells .
CEM-R cells were derived from the apoptosis-sensitive parental CEM cell line by continuous culture in doxorubicin for several months . '' ''
CEM-R cells did not exhibit an MDR phenotype of drug resistance and were cross-resistant to apoptosis induction by several DILs .
CEM-R cells showed a similar basal NFKB activity , similar p65 content ( data not shown ) , and similar TRAIL-mediated NFB activation compared with CEM cells , but a slightly increased sensitivity for LLnL ( data not shown ) .
In these cells , inhibition of NFB activation significantly attenuated apoptosis resistance towards DILs and doxorubicin , predominantly for TRAIL and TNFa .
Activation of NFB has been found after treatment of tumor cells with cytostatic drugs .
'* '' '' In cells cross-resistant for DIL and drug-induced apoptosis , inhibition of NFB activation by LLnL sensitizes for both DILs and drugs .
Recent evidence suggests that induction of apoptosis in target cells by cytostatic drugs may involve DILs such as the CD95 system . '' ''
Drugs also increase cellular TRAIL mRNA and TNFa mRNA* ( Herr et al , manuscript submitted ) , suggesting a possible additional role for TRAIL and TNFa : in drug-induced apoptosis .
Because induction of apoptosis by anticancer drugs may involve DILs,4 '' activation of NFB after drug treatment may be a consequence TRAIL 4629 ) A S 10 4 specific apoptosis ( % LLnL + | + £ 4 ThiFc [ + ] + TRAIL +LLnL of DIL function .
Thus , LLnL might overcome drug resistance by sensitizing for DIL-induced apoptosis .
The concept that inhibition of NFB activation increases apoptosis sensitivity was also investigated in primary tumor cells of patients with acute leukemias ex vivo .
Although no specific apoptosis was induced using DIL alone , a significant increase in specific cell death could be obtained by TRAIL in the presence of LLnL in 5 of 6 patients .
Recently , it was suggested that apoptosis resistance for TRAIL might be based on presence of two TRAIL receptors that contain an absent or truncated intracellular signal transducing death domain ( TRAIL-R3 , TRID , DeR1 , LIT,262730344445 and TRAIL-R4 , DeR2454 ) , The distribution pattern of TRAIL-R3 suggested that normal , but not malignant cells were resistant towards TRAIL-induced apoptosis .
In line with this , we found that normal peripheral T cells remain resistant towards TRAIL-induced apoptosis even after activation . ''
Additionally , the majority of leukemic cell lines tested display a TRAIL-sensitive phenotype .
`` > * '' However , all primary leukemia cells used here were almost completely resistant towards TRAIL-induced apoptosis .
Because LLnL sensitizes patient cells for TRAIL-induced apoptosis , the molecular mechanism of apoptosis resistance seems to be more complex and might additionally involve intracellular signal proteins that may at least partially depend on NFkB activity .
The mechanism by which activation of NFB antagonizes induction of apoptosis remains to be elucidated .
Coincubstion of TRAIL , CD95-L , or TNFa with an inhibitor of protein synthesis , eg , cycloheximide , also augments induction of apoptosis and attenuates apoptosis resistance ( data not shown ) .
Thus , de novo protein synthesis protects cells from DIL-induced cytotoxicity probably by induction of protective genes eventually mediated by NFkB .
NFkB-dependent proteins might interfere with pathways leading to caspase activation and might participate in generating abundant cross-resistances between different apoptosis-inducing agents .
Further studies are needed to detect the effectors of the NFKB activation signal as well as From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .
