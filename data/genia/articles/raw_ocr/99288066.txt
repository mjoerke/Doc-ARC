We have now investigated the mechanism of action of a new analogue of UP , PNU156804 , which shows a more favorable activity profile than UP in mice .
We demonstrate here that the biological effect of PNU156804 in vitro is indistinguishable from UP : PNU156804 blocks human T cell proliferation in mid-late G , , as determined by cell cycle analysis , expression of cyclins , and cyclin-dependent kinases and retinoblastoma phosphorylation .
In addition , we show that PNU156804 does not block significantly the induction of either IL-2 or IL-2R a- and y-chains but inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation .
We have investigated several molecular pathways that are known to be activated by IL-2 in T cells .
We show that PNU156804 does not inhibit c-myc and bel-2 mRNA induction .
On the other hand , PNU156804 efficiently inhibits the activation of the NF-B and AP-1 transcription factors .
PNU156804 inhibition of activation is due to the inhibition of the degradation of IxB-a & and IxB- .
PNU156804 action is restricted to some signaling pathways ; it does not affect NF-B activation by PMA in T cells but blocks that induced by CD40 cross-linking in B lymphocytes .
We conclude that the prodigiosin family of immunosuppressants is a new family of molecules that show a novel target specificity clearly distinct from that of other immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A , FK506 , and rapamycin .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 ; 7102-7109. yelosporin A ( CsA ) has proved an extremely useful and potent immunosuppressive drug in organ transplantation and is also employed to treat some autoimmune diseases ( 1-3 ) .
However its deleterious side effects , in particular renal toxicity , have encouraged the search for new immunosuppressive compounds ( 3 , 4 ) .
Drugs showing a different mechanism of action than CsA are likely to be good candidates for combined therapy with CsA .
In particular , drugs affecting IL-2-dependent signaling should be of particular interest , not only for their potential clinical use but also to define the role of the different molecular cascades triggered by IL-2 in T cell proliferation .
We have previously described the biological activity of a new immunosuppressive drug , undecylprodigiosin ( UP ) , on human T and B lymphocytes in vitro ( 5 ) .
This compound was encouraging since it efficiently inhibited the polyclonal proliferation of primary human T and B lymphocytes induced by a variety of Ca**-dependent and Ca**-indepen-dent mitogens .
It also completely blocked the proliferation and immortalization of B cells by EBV .
At a concentration fully active on primary lymphocytes ( 50 ng/m1 ) , UP did not affect significantly the proliferation of transformed leukemic cell lines in vitro .

Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists nally , the effect of UP on the induction of protooncogenes and cell cycle genes had shown that UP had a different mechanism of action than CsA , FK506 , or rapamycin , making it a good candidate drug for combined immunotherapy with these agents ( 5 ) .
UP , however , has never been developed as an immunosuppressant because it was found to produce too severe side effects in vivo ( Ref .
5 and Isetta et al. , unpublished observations ) .
This led to the screening for UP analogues with more favorable activities in vivo .
The analogue PNU156804 showed promising activity as an immunosuppressant in mice .
In particular PNU156804 gave a 2- to 3-fold more favorable ratio of effective vs lethal dose in a DTH model in vivo .
Also it showed toxic effects in vitro on resting lymphocytes or cell lines at 30-fold higher doses than UP ( Isetta et al. , manuscript in preparation ) .
This compound was therefore selected for further studies .
We have investigated the biological effect and mechanism of action of PNU156804 on primary human lymphocytes in vitro .
We demonstrate that prodigiosins are a new class of immunosuppressive molecules that efficiently inhibit IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation and show novel molecular targets .
Materials and Methods Cells and cell cultures Human primary T lymphocytes were obtained from buffy coats of normal volunteers .
Briefly , mononuclear cells were separated on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient ( Seromed , Berlin , Germany ) , and lymphocytes were separated from monocytes by centrifugation onto 50 % isoosmotic Percoll ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
If necessary , residual monocytes were removed by 1-h adherence onto tissue culture petri dishes ( Falcon , Oxnard , England ) in complete medium .
The resulting lymphocyte population contained 1-2 % CD14* monocytes , 6-10 % CD20 B lymphocytes , and > 80 % CD3+* T lymphocytes , as determined by indirect immunofluores-cence with appropriate mAbs on the FACS .
Resting B lymphocytes were purified from fresh human tonsils , obtained from routine tonsillectomies , as described previously ( 6 ) .
Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium ( Se-romed ) , supplemented with 10 % FCS ( HyClone , Steril System , Logan , UT ) , glutamine ( Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) , and 50 g/ml gen-tamicin ( Life Technologies ) .

Killed Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I ( SAC ) strain bacteria ( Calbiochem ) were used at 0.005 % .
PMA was obtained from Sigma and used at 3 ng/ml .
UP and PNU156804 were obtained by a fully synthetic process ( D'Alessio et al. , manuscript in preparation ) .
Purified anti-CD40 Ab ( clone 626.1 ) was a kind gift of Dr. D. Vercelli ( DIBIT , Hospital San Raffaele , Milan , Italy ) .
Cell stimulations , proliferation , and cytotoxicity assays Primary lymphocytes were plated at 1-2 X 10 % /ml in flasks ( for RNA and protein extractions ) or in quadruplicate in 96-well plates ( Falcon ) .
At 48 h , 0.5 uCi |HJthymidine was added in each well ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) , and the cells were harvested in a Titertek cell harvester ( Ska-tron , Lyerbyen , Norway ) 12-16 h later .
For IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation , T lymphocytes were stimulated for 72 h with 1 pg/ml PHA to induce expression of the IL-2R .
Cells were then washed and replated in medium containing 1 % FCS .
After 24 h , recombinant human IL-2 ( rhIL-2 ; Serono , Rome , Italy ) was added at 200 U/ml .
PNU156804 or UP were added at the indicated concentrations 10 min before IL-2 .
Nuclear extracts were prepared 30 min or 4 h after addition of IL-2 .
Thymidine incorporation was measured at 48-60 h. To measure cell death , T lymphocytes were stimulated as above for 48 h. Cells were then stained with FITC-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide ( PT ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) and analyzed on a FACScan apparatus ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Cell cycle analysis Monoparametric cell cycle analysis on ethanol-fixed cells using PI was performed as described previously ( 7 ) .
Analysis was done on at least 10* cells using a FACStar '' '' ( Becton Dickinson ) .
The Baisch method was used to assess the cell cycle phase distribution ( 7 ) .
RNA extraction and Northern blots RNA was extracted by standard guanidium isothiocyanate and cesium chloride gradient purification .
Twenty micrograms total RNA was run in 1 % formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto GeneScreen Plus membranes according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
All probes were labeled with *°P by standard nick-translation .
The cDNA probes have been described previously ( 5 ) .
The edk2 and edk4 plasmids used as probes were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Man-assas , VA ) .
Western blots Western blots were performed essentially as described ( 5 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts were loaded and run in 8-12 % SDS/polyacrylamide gels .
The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters ( Schleicher & Schuell , Dassel , Germany ) for 3-5 h at 35 V , according to standard procedures .
The blots were incubated first in blocking solution ( PBS containing 5 % nonfat milk powder ) overnight , then with rabbit antiserum or mouse monoclonal according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
All specific Abs used for Western blots were from Santa Cruz ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Secondary Abs conjugated to HRP were from Amersham and used at 1/1000 .
Between each incubation , the blots were washed three times for 10 min in PBS containing 0.5 % NP4O0 .

The nuclear pellets were lysed in buffer B ( 500 mM KCI , 25 mM HEPES ( pH 7.8 ) , 10 % glycerol , and 100 wM DTT ) containing protease inhibitors with gentle shaking for 20 min at 4°C .
The lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C .

Double-stranded oligonucleotides carrying a binding site for NF- « B ( from the HIV-1 promoter ) and for AP-1 ( from the IL-8 promoter ) were as follows : NF-KB , dGGTCCAGAGGGGACTTITTCCGAGAGGC ; AP-1 , dGTGTGATGACTCAGGTTTCC .
The oligonucleotides were labeled with [ °P ] dCTP and klenow enzyme .
For binding , 2-5 ug nuclear extract was bound to 0.2 ng probe in binding buffer ( 40 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.5 ) , 120 mM KCl , 8 % Ficoll 400 , 4 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT , and 2 ug poly ( dIdC ) ) for 30 min .
In supershift experiments , 2 pl specific Abs was added .
7103 Results PNU156804 inhibits human T and B cell proliferation UP , the first identified member of the prodigiosin family , showed too severe side effects upon prolonged treatment in vivo ( 5 ) for development as an immunosuppressant .
Screening for prodigiosin analogues with a more favorable activity led to the identification of PNU156804 , whose structure is shown in Fig .
1 together with that of UP .
PNU156804 has a benzylic substitution in place of methylic substitution on the oxydrylic group .
To determine the activity and mechanism of action of PNU156804 on human T lymphocytes , we first determined its capacity to inhibit mitogen-induced T cell or B cell proliferation in comparison with UP .
As shown in Fig .
24 , PNU156804 inhibited by up to 90 % the proliferation of human T cells stimulated by PHA .
The optimal inhibitory dose was 200-300 ng/ml , compared with 50 ng/ml for UP .
Thus a 4- to 6-fold higher concentration of PNU156804 than UP is required .
Of note is that the dose-response curve of PNU156804 is less sharp than than of UP .
PNU156804 also inhibited the MLR response of T cells , with a similar dose-response curve ( Fig .
2B ) , showing that inhibition is efficient also in a more physiological model of T cell response and is not specific for PHA .
Similarly , PNU156804 efficiently inhibited SAC-induced tonsillar B cell proliferation ( Fig .
2C ) , as well as EBV-induced B cell proliferation and immortalization ( data not shown ) .
Again the dose response curves were similar to those obtained in PHA stimulated T cells .
We verified that the drug PNU156804 did not induce cell death by microscopic examination at different times and by quantifica-tion of cell death with a standard method that detects extracellular phosphatidyl serine with fluorescein-labeled annexin V and FACS analysis .
As shown in Table I , PNU156804 at a fully active concentration ( 300 ng/m ! )
did not induce a significant increase in either apoptotic or necrotic cells above that induced by PHA alone .
Less than 4 % more dead cells could be detected in presence of B. PNU156804 C11H23 HCI FIGURE 1 .

On the other hand , incubation of the cells overnight with staurosporine as a control led to a 3- to 4-fold increase in both apoptotic and necrotic cells .
PNU156804 inhibits T cell proliferation in mid-late G , To determine the cell cycle phase of inhibition by PNU156804 , we also analyzed the DNA content of human T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA in the presence or absence of PNU156804 .
As shown in Fig .
3 , entry of the cells in the S/G , /M phases of the cell cycle , induced by PHA at 48 h , was completely blocked by PNU156804 .
These data show that PNU156804 inhibits T cell activation before entry into S phase .

In particular we investigated the effect of PNU156804 on cyclin D2 , cyclin E , edk2 , and edk4 mRNA induction .

Inhibition of edk2 , edk4 , and cyclin E was confirmed at the protein level in Western blots ( Fig .
4B , and data not shown ) .
Finally , we demonstrated that , similarly to UP , PNU156804 inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , observable as a series of bands of higher apparent m.w .
( p112-114 ) in Western blots ( Fig .
4B ) .
Finally , PNU156804 , like UP , did not inhibit the down-regulation of p27 protein ( Fig .
4B ) .
All together , the data presented demonstrate that PNU156804 efficiently inhibits human T cell proliferation with little toxicity , that it blocks T cells in mid-late G , , and that it shows a similar mechanism of action as UP at least as far as cell cycle genes are concerned .
PNU156804 blocks IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation G , -G , phase progression in T cells is accompanied by induction of IL-2 and the IL-2R , and signaling by IL-2 drives entry into S phase ( 8 , 9 ) .
In these cells , the IL-2R is mostly regulated by induction of the -chain during activation , allowing high affinity binding ( 9 ) .
We therefore investigated the effect of PNU156804 on IL-2 and IL-2R a-chain expression .
IL-2Ra mRNA was strongly induced by PHA and was not inhibited by PNU156804 ( Fig .
5 ) .
At the protein level , induction of IL-2Ra by PHA was slightly lower but was not abolished in the presence of PNU156804 ( Table II ) .
IL-2 expression was not affected at either the protein ( Table II ) or RNA level ( data not shown ) , as previously observed for UP ( 5 ) .
Since expression of the IL-2R y-chain also increases during T cell activation ( 9 ) , we also investigated its regulation in the presence of the drug .
As shown in Fig .
5 , y-chain mRNA induction was unaffected by PNU156804 .

inhibits T cell proliferation mostly downstream from IL-2 and IL-2R expression , in agreement with a block in mid-late G , .
To test directly whether PNU156804 inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation , peripheral T lymphocytes were preactivated with PHA for 72 h to induce IL-2R expression ( 10 ) .
The cells were then washed and starved for 24 h in the absence of IL-2 .
rhIL-2 was then added to the cells in the presence or absence of PNU156804 .
As shown in Fig .
6A , preactivated starved T cells required exog-enously added IL-2 to proliferate , and this proliferation was inhibited efficiently by PNU156804 .
Furthermore the dose-response curve for inhibition of IL-2-dependent proliferation ( Fig .
6B ) was superimposable to that obtained on primary T cells ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) .
We conclude that PNU156804 inhibits events taking place downstream from the interaction of IL-2 with its receptor .
PNU156804 specifically inhibits activation of NF- « B and AP-1 Several signaling cascades are known to be triggered by IL-2 that lead to the expression of different sets of genes and transcription factors thought to be important for the proliferative and antiapoptotic response of T cells ( 8 , 9 , 11-13 ) .
To determine in more detail the mechanism of action of PNU156804 and determine which signaling pathway is affected by the drug , we have set out to determine the effect of PNU156804 on the pathways triggered by IL-2 , which are thought to be important for the proliferative response of the cells , in particular the induction of c-myc , bel-2 , AP-1 , and NF- « B , using the IL-2-dependent system .
As shown in Fig .
74 , c-mye mRNA is strongly induced at 3 h after addition of IL-2 , and this induction is not affected by PNU156804 .
Similarly , bel-2 expression is clearly up-regulated with a peak around 8-12 h after stimulation with IL-2 , and this stimulation is not inhibited by PNU156804 ( Fig .
7B ) .
Thus , PNU156804 does not affect the signaling pathways that lead to c-myc and bel-2 induction in response to IL-2 .

PNU156804 inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation .
Human T cells preactivated with PHA for 72 h were starved for 24 h in 1 % FCS in the absence of IL-2 .
They were then stimulated with 200 U/ml rhIL-2 in the presence or absence of PNU156804 at 300 ng/ml ( 4 ) or different doses ( B ) .
[ °H ] Thymidine incorporation was measured at the indicated times ( 4 ) or at 48 h ( B ) .
We next set out to measure the activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF- « B .
For this purpose , an EMSA was chosen that can directly measure the activation state of these factors in nuclear extracts .
Oligonucleotides carrying a binding site specific for each transcription factor were used .
As shown in Fig .
84 , both NF- « B and AP-1 , which are also strongly induced 4 h after addition of IL-2 , were inhibited by up to 90 % by PNU156804 .
Competition assays with the cold AP-1 and NF- « B oligonucleotides confirmed that the retarded bands were specific ( Fig .

RNA was extracted at 0 , 3 , or 8 h following stimulation and analyzed for c-myc ( A ) or bel-2 ( B ) expression by Northern blotting .
INHIBITION OF IL-2-DEPENDENT SIGNALING BY PNU156804 NE- « B and AP-1 are known to be activated by many extracellular signals and several second messenger cascades ( 9 , 13-15 ) .
Since PNU156804 blocks IL-2-driven G , -S proliferation , we investigated whether PNU156804 could also inhibit PMA-induced activation of NF- « B and AP-1 in resting T cells .
As shown in Fig .
8B , PMA strongly activated both transcription factors , but PNU156804 did not inhibit this activation in any way .
Similarly , PNU156804 showed no inhibitory effect on PHA-induced AP-1 or NF- « B activation ( data not shown ) .
We conclude that PNU156804 specifically inhibits IL-2- and not phorbol ester- or PHA-triggered activation of NF- « B and AP-1 in T cells .
To evaluate the specificity of inhibition by PNU156804 for IL-2 signaling , we also investigated the effect of the drug on a more physiological signal such as CD40 triggering of a B cell line .
As shown in Fig .
8C , the results show that PNU156804 can inhibit CDA4O-triggered activation of NF- « B measured by EMSA .
We conclude that PNU156804 blocks NF-KB induction by some ( IL-2 , CD40 ) but not all ( PMA , PHA ) signals .
PNU156804 inhibits NF-KB activation through inhibition of IxB degradation To investigate in more detail by which mechanism PNU156804 inhibited NF-KB activation , we first conducted supershift experiments .
As shown in Fig .
94 , anti-p50 Abs supershifted completely the IL-2-induced NF- « B complex , whereas anti-p65 Abs led only to a partial supershift .
This indicates that the IL-2-induced NF- « B complexes contain p50/p65 heterodimers as well as p50 ho-modimers or p50 complexed with another c-re/ family member .
NE- « B activation is usually regulated through phosphorylation of IB , the NF- « B-associated inhibitor , with degradation of IB followed by translocation of free NF-KB to the nucleus ( 15 , 16 ) .
We therefore investigated the effect of PNU156804 on cytoplasmic IkB-a and IxB-B expression .
As shown in Fig .
9B , IL-2 induced a rapid degradation of and IxB-f3 , and this degradation was completely blocked by PNU156804 .
We conclude that PNU156804 inhibits NF- « B activation through inhibition of IB degradation .
Discussion In this report , the activity of a new analogue of the prodigiosin family of immunosuppressive drugs ( 5 , 17 , 18 ) , PNU156804 , is described for the first time .
In addition , the mechanism of action of PNU156804 on human primary T lymphocytes is investigated in detail .
The major conclusions that can be drawn are the following .
1 ) PNU156804 efficiently inhibits the proliferation of primary human T and B lymphocytes triggered by mitogenic or antigenic stimuli ( MLR ) .
2 ) The proliferation block takes place in mid to late G , as shown by cell cycle analysis and the pattern of expression of cell cycle genes .
3 ) PNU156804 inhibits T cell proliferation downstream from the induction of IL-2 and the IL-2R and indeed blocks IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation .
4 ) PNU156804 does not inhibit the induction of the c-myc and bel-2 genes in response to IL-2 .
5 ) PNU156804 efficiently blocks the activation of the NF- « B and AP-1 transcription factors induced by IL-2 .
It has no effect on the activation of the same factors triggered by phorbol ester or PHA .
However , it blocks NF-KB activation by CD40 on B cells , suggesting that the PNU156804 target is not restricted to IL-2 signaling .
We conclude that PNU156804 targets a signaling pathway triggered by IL-2 that leads to activation of NF- « B and AP-1 .
Furthermore we hypothesize that the effect of PNU156804 on NF- « B and AP-1 activation is responsible for the block of T cell proliferation brought about by the drug .

demonstrate that PNU156804 shows a different mechanism of action than other immunosuppressive drugs such as CsA , FK506 , and rapamycin ( 3 , 19-21 ) .
The effectiveness of PNU156804 action , its specificity for defined signaling pathways , and its diversity from other immunosuppressants , in particular CsA and FK506 , make this drug and other members of the prodigiosin family good candidate drugs for combined immunotherapy .
Furthermore , the mechanism of action of PNU156804 defined here makes this family of compounds interesting new tools to dissect the IL-2-signal-ing pathways that lead to T cell proliferation .
A simplified scheme of the intracellular signaling cascades induced by IL-2 and based on this report and available published data is shown in Fig .
10 ( 8 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 22 , 23 ) .
The differences in the effects of PNU156804 and rapamycin on these cascades are also indicated .
Previously we had investigated the biological effects of the first isolated member of the prodigiosin family , UP , on human T and B lymphocytes in vitro ( 5 ) .

Nuclear extracts for band shift experiments ( A ) or cytoplasmic extracts for Western blots ( B ) were prepared .

The presence of IxB- « and IxB-B was analyzed by Western blotting ( B ) .
activity on the proliferation of primary lymphocytes without affecting significantly the in vitro growth of leukemic cell lines , it showed too severe toxic side effects during prolonged in vivo treatment in mice to permit its development as a therapeutic agent .
For this reason , a screening was performed to identify new analogues of UP with more favorable activities in vitro and in vivo in mice , and PNU156804 was identified as a suitable candidate since it has a lower ratio of toxic vs effective dose than UP .
The effect and mechanism of action of PNU156804 were investigated in primary human T lymphocytes .
The first part of this report was directed at determining the activity of PNU156804 on human T and B lymphocytes , the point of the cell cycle where the cells became blocked , and at comparing the activity of PNU156804 with that of UP itself , as well as of other known immunosuppressive drugs such as rapamycin .
PNU156804 was found to inhibit the proliferation of human T and B lymphocytes by 80-90 % at 200-300 ng/ml .
Thus , PNU156804 is as effective as UP but at doses 4-6 times higher .
This is in agreement with in vivo data in mice .
We have also determined that PNU156804 , like UP ( 5 ) , strongly inhibits B cell proliferation STAT3 and 5 x ?

Thus , PNU156804 shows the same biological activity as UP in vitro on human lymphocytes .
The capacity to block the immortalization of B lymphocytes by EBV is an important advantage for a candidate immunosuppressive drug due to the frequent occurrence of EBV-induced lymphomas in immunosuppressed patients ( 3 ) .
Analysis of the cell cycle profile and cell cycle-regulated genes in PNU156804-treated T cells has allowed us to conclude that PNU156804 blocks T cell proliferation in mid-late G , , suggesting that that its target is very similar to that of UP ( 5 ) .
In particular we show that PNU156804 inhibits cells between cyclin D2 and cyclin E expression and that both cdk2 and edk4 are completely inhibited ( 5 , 24 , 25 ) .
Furthermore we show that retinoblastoma protein remains hypophosphorylated in the presence of PNU156804 ( 5 , 26 ) .
Finally , we demonstrate that PNU156804 does not inhibit the down-regulation of p27 protein , clearly distinguishing it from rapamycin , which on the contrary blocks p27 degradation ( 19 , 27 , 28 ) .
Thus the prodigiosin family represents a new family of molecules with a common mechanism of action and specific molecular targets .
The second part was aimed at identifying more precisely possible target proteins of PNU156804 action .
We have first demonstrated that PNU156804 blocks IL-2-dependent signaling .
It does not inhibit significantly the induction of IL-2 and of its receptor a-and y-chains but efficiently blocks IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation .
These data led to the investigation of the different signaling pathways known to be triggered by IL-2 in T cells .
IL-2 responses are mediated by the IL-2R complex , which is composed of three subunits , « , 3 , and y ( 8 , 9 , 29 ) .
The -chain is responsible for high affinity IL-2 binding , whereas the B- and y-chains mediate signaling ( 8 , 9 ) .
Several non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as Jak1 , Jak3 , p56 '' ** , and syk interact with the IL-2R and become activated after IL-2 engagement ( 8 , 9 , 19 , 29-33 ) ( Fig .
10 ) .
IL-2 also activates PI3-kinase ( 9 , 19 , 22 , 34 , 35 ) .
These different kinases in turn activate different cascades that lead both to the induction of c-myc , c-fos , and c-jun , which form the transcription factors AP-1 and bel-2 , and to the activation of STAT transcription factors ( 10 , 12 , 13 , 29 , 30 , 33 , 36-39 ) .
IL-2 has also been shown to activate NF-KB ( 9 , 40 ) ( Fig .
10 ) .
The serine rich ( S ) region of the IL-2 -chain is known to associate with Jak1 and syk and to be required for induction of c-mye and bel-2 ( 9 , 29 , 36 ) .
The acidic domain ( A ) is required for activation of p56 '' ** , for association of the adapter protein she , which may mediate activation of p21ras and of the MAPK cascades , and for induction of c-fos and c-jun gene expression ( 9 , 13 , 29 , 31 , 41 ) .
The mechanism of activation of PI3-kinase is still unclear but requires the S region and leads to activation of protein kinase B ( PKB , also called Akt ) , which may participate in induction of bel-2 and down-regulation of p27 ( 22 , 34 , 37 ) .
The mechanism of activation of NF-KB is still unclear but may involve kinases of the JNK pathway and in particular MEKK-1 ( 15 , 16 ) ( Fig .
10 ) .
Evidence has been presented that activation of c-myc , AP-1 , and bel-2 is important for the proliferative response of T cells to IL-2 ( 13 , 29 , 42 , 43 ) .
Here we confirmed bel-2 and c-myc induction by IL-2 in our IL-2-dependent system , but we showed that PNU156804 does not affect the expression of these genes .
These data , as well as the lack of inhibition of p27 down-regulation , suggest that the Syk and PT3-kinase pathways possibly involved in the signaling of IL-2 to these molecules are not targets of PNU156804 action ( Fig .
10 ) .
On the contrary , PNU156804 very efficiently inhibits both NF-KB and AP-1 activation in response to IL-2 .
Furthermore , we confirm that a major NF-kB complex induced by IL-2 in our primary T cell INHIBITION OF IL-2-DEPENDENT SIGNALING BY PNU156804 system is the p50/p65 ( relA ) complex and show that IL-2 signaling leads to rapid down-regulation of IkB-a and IkB- $ B , as described for many of the other signals that activate NF- « B ( 15 , 16 , 44 ) .
Finally we demonstrate that PNU156804 inhibits the IL-2-induced down-regulation of IxB- « and IxB- $ B .
These data strongly suggest that PNU156804 inhibits NF-KB activation through inhibition of IxB-a and IxB-B down-regulation .
IxB-a and IKB-B are thought to undergo phosphorylation by IB kinase complex ( es ) , and this phosphorylation event renders these proteins targets for protea-some-mediated protein degradation ( 15 , 16 , 44 ) .
It is likely that many second messengers can trigger these phosphorylation events through activation of perhaps several IB kinases , since many different signals can activate NF-KB in different cells , including TNF , IL-1 , LPS , phorbol esters , anti-CD28 , etc .
All signals , however , appear to act by degrading IB molecules ( 15 ) .
Recently , a ubiquination-sensitive IB kinase complex has been described , and two IB kinases have been cloned that are part of a different multiprotein complex ( 45-47 ) .
Little is known about the second messengers that are triggered by IL-2 and lead to NF-KB activation and about which IB kinase may be involved in IL-2-induced NF- « B activation ( 9 , 40 ) .
The data presented here suggest that PNU156804 inhibits an IL-2-specific signaling pathway that leads to IkB-a and IxB- degradation and which is not shared by PMA or PHA , since PNU156804 did not inhibit PMA- or PHA-induced NF- « B activation .
Furthermore , NF- « B is thought to play a role in the induction of IL-2 and IL-2Ra transcription ( 15 ) .
The fact that expression of these two genes was little affected by PNU156804 is in agreement with a specific inhibition of NF- « B activation downstream from the interaction between IL-2 and its receptor .
Numerous signals can , however , lead to NF- « B activation in different cells .
The experiments presented suggest that PNU156804 can also inhibit NF- « B induction by CD40 Abs in B cells .
Thus , the inhibition of NF-KB activation by PNU156804 is not specific solely for the IL-2-dependent signaling pathway .
A complete investigation of the different signals and intracellular cascades that lead to NF- « B activation in different cell types and their sensitivity to PNU156804 will be of particular interest in identifying a molecular target for PNU156804 but is clearly beyond the scope of this article .
Although much more information is available on the IL-2-induced activation of AP-1 activity , the exact signaling pathways have not yet been clearly identified ( 8 , 13 , 14 , 29 , 31 , 35 , 48 ) .
AP-1 activation is regulated at different levels , involving transcription of its components such as c-fos and c-jun and activation of c-jun through phosphorylation by JNK ( 13 , 14 , 48 ) .
Furthermore , activation of ras through the p56 '' * and the she , sos , grb pathways and possibly through the action of other IL-2-associated kinases can lead to activation of the MAP kinase ( ERK ) and JNK pathways , which are required for maximal AP-1 activation ( 13 , 14 , 38 , 43 , 48-50 ) ( Fig .
10 ) .
Thus , the exact target of PNU156804 that leads to AP-1 inhibition will require a more detailed characterization of its effects on these kinase cascades , which is beyond the scope of this paper .
It is again of particular interest that PNU156804 specifically blocks the IL-2- and not PMA-induced AP-1 activation , suggesting a specific effect on a target downstream from IL-2 .
Interestingly MEKK-1 , a kinase that is upstream from the JNK cascade and therefore plays a role in AP-1 activation , has been shown to activate NF- « B through activation of one or more IB kinase complexes ( 15 , 23 ) .
Thus , the AP-1 and NF-KB pathways appear to be linked by MEKK-1 ( Fig .
10 ) .
It is tempting to speculate that a target of PNU156804 could lie in the pathway linking the IL-2 receptor to such a dual kinase capable of activating both the NF- « B and AP-1 pathways .
6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology We conclude that the prodigiosin family of drugs show a very specific effect on IL-2-induced signaling , leading to NF- « B and AP-1 activation .
These two transcription factor complexes appear to be involved in the control of several cellular functions , including proliferation and apoptosis ( 8 , 29 , 36 , 51 ) .
Thus , we hypothesize that inhibition of AP-1 and NF- « B may be responsible at least in part for the proliferation block induced by prodigiosins .
The effi-cacy , specificity of action , and diversity relative to other known immunosuppressive drugs make this family of compounds of great interest for further preclinical studies , as well as interesting tools to further dissect the signaling pathways triggered by IL-2 in T lymphocytes .
Furthermore , the centrality of IL-2 signaling and AP-1 and NF-KB activation in the biology of T and other cell types makes this class of compounds of wide interest .
