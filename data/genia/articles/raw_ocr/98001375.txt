Received 12 March 1997/Accepted 30 July 1997 Recruitment and extravasation of T cells through the blood-brain barrier are favored by adhesion molecule-mediated interactions of circulating T cells with endothelial cells .
Since a common pathological finding in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -associated diseases is the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes into various organs , we have looked for the profile of adhesion molecules expressed by HTLV-1-transformed T cells .
Flow cytometry analysis indicated that these cells were expressing high levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1 [ CD106 ] ) , a 110-kDa member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily , first identified on endothelial cells stimulated with inflammatory cytokines .
This adhesion molecule was also expressed by T cells obtained from one patient with HTLV-1l-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis but not by activated T cells isolated from one normal blood donor .
The role of the viral frans-activator Tax protein in the induction of VCAM-1 was first indicated by the detection of this adhesion molecule on Jurkat T-cell clones stably expressing the tax gene .
The effect of Tax on VCAM-1 gene transcription was next confirmed in JPX-9 cells , a subclone of Jurkat cells , carrying the fax sequences under the control of an inducible promoter .
Furthermore , deletion and mutation analyses of the VCAM-1 promoter performed with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that Tax was frans activating the VCAM-1 promoter via two NF-B sites present at bp -72 and -57 in the VCAM-1 gene promoter , with both of them being required for the Tax-induced expression of this adhesion molecule .
Finally , gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two NF-KB motifs , confirming that VCAM-1 was induced on Tax-expressing cells in a « B-dependent manner .
Collectively , these results therefore suggest that the exclusive Tax-induced expression of VCAM-1 on T cells may represent a pivotal event in the progression of HTLV-1l-associated diseases .
Most of individuals infected by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) remain asymptomatic , indicating that exposure to the virus leads to persistent infection that rarely results in disease progression .
Indeed , only 1 to 5 % of infected persons develop either adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) or a nonmalignant neurologic disorder termed HTLV-l-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) ( 13 , 24 , 39 , 41 , 50 , 54 , 56 ) .
The mechanisms involved in progression to either disease remain to be clarified , but might include genetic predisposition , age at infection , routes of transmission , and differences of the host immune responses .
The interplay of two viral regulatory proteins , Tax and Rex , strictly regulates HTLV-1 gene expression .
Tax , a 40-kDa nuclear protein , increases transcription by acting via 21-bp repeats found in the proviral 5 ' long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
Rex , a 27-kDa nuclear/nucleolar protein , acts at the posttranscrip-tional level via an mRNA Rex-responsive element located in the 3 ' LTR to facilitate the export of mRNAs required for the synthesis of viral enzymes and structural proteins ( 7 , 10 , 47 ) .
In addition , numerous investigations have been devoted to unraveling the effects of Tax in the onset and development of dis * Corresponding author .

8522 eases linked to HTLV-1 T-cell infection .
Indeed , the trans-activating capacity of Tax enables this protein to intervene in the induction and/or the increased expression of a large collection of cellular genes , such as those coding for cytokines , cytokine receptors , proto-oncogenes , and cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin ( 10 , 12 , 55 ) .
Tax does not bind DNA directly ( 2 , 38 ) .
Indeed , the activation of these cellular genes is correlated with the ability of Tax to interact with the activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding ( ATF-1/CREB ) family and the serum response factor ( 4 , 11 ) .
Likewise , by interacting with IxBa or NF-kB precursors , Tax is able to increase the nuclear localization of the NF- « B-related family of transcription factors ( 3 , 17 , 34 , 49 ) .
Thus , by deregulating the transcription of cellular genes involved in T-cell activation and proliferation , Tax is playing a crucial role in viral pathogenesis .
A pathological finding common to ATL and HAM/TSP is the infiltration of lymphocytes into various organs .
Indeed , ATL cells are able to invade organs such as the liver , spleen , lungs , and skin ( 50 , 54 ) .
Furthermore , infiltration of HTLV-1-infected T cells into the central nervous system may be a hallmark of the evolution of the pathogenic process and may act by triggering the chronic inflammatory lesions observed in HAM/TSP patients ( 18 , 20-22 , 25 ) .
The emigration of lymphocytes from the periphery has been shown to be dependent on three distinct interactions of adhesion molecules with endothelial cells , selectin-carbohydrate , chemoattractant-receptor , and voL .
71 , 1997 integrin-immunoglobulin ( Ig ) ( for reviews , see references 5 and 48 ) .
Recent observations have provided evidence for the Tax-induced expression of adhesion molecules , which might be involved in HTLV-1-infected T-cell infiltration .
Thus , it has been observed that Tax is responsible for the upregulation of both intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 [ CDS54 ] ) , a member of the Ig gene superfamily , and lymphocyte function antigen 3 ( LFA-3 [ CD58 ] ) in HTLV-1-infected T cells ( 32 , 51 , 52 ) .
The L-selectin gene , which is constitutively overexpressed in fresh ATL cells , can be transactivated by Tax ( 53 ) .
Besides these conventional adhesion models , the OX40/gp34 interactions define another adhesion pathway .
Indeed , OX40 , a type I transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family expressed by activated T cells , mediates the adhesion of these cells to gp34 ( OX4A40L ) , present on vascular endothelial cells .
Both OX40 and gp34 have been shown to be constitutively expressed on the membrane of Tax-expressing T lymphocytes ( 15 , 23 ) .
In this report , we first show that T cells carrying proviral HTLV-1 were expressing high levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1-CD106 ) , a 110-kDa member of the Ig gene superfamily , which has been found to be expressed mainly on endothelial cells , only when stimulated with inflammatory mediators ( 9 , 40 ) .
We then investigate the role of Tax in trans-activating the expression of VCAM-1 by Jurkat clones stably expressing the tex gene and finally determine the regulatory elements in the VCAM-1 promoter that were responsive to Tax .
We found that the two NF- « B sites present at positions -72 and -53 in the VCAM-1 gene promoter are absolutely required for the Tax-induced expression of this adhesion molecule .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies .

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) was from Sigma .
Plasmids and transfections .
pMTenvyXLTR , containing the coding sequences of env , fax , and rex together with the HTLV-1 3 ' LTR , and MT-Tax , encoding only Tax , were under the control of the mouse metallothionein promoter ( 14 ) .
Another Tax expression plasmid ( SV40-Tax ) was kindly provided by P. Jalinot ( Ecole Normale Supérieure , Lyon ) .
The SV40-Neo plasmid carries the neo resistance gene under the control of the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) promoter .
Three VCAM-1 reporter plasmids in which various fragments of the promoter/en-hancer region of the human VCAM-1 gene were linked to bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) have been described previously ( 36 ) and were kindly provided by T. Collins ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , Mass . ) .
These deletion plasmids were FfL-pCAT3 ( -2167 ) , F3-pCAT3 ( -98 ) , and F4-pCAT ( -44 ) .
In addition , the two F3MA-pCAT3 and F3MB-pCAT3 constructs , both derived from the F3-pCAT3 plasmid , have point mutations in the 5 ' and 3 ' NF- « B motifs , respectively .
Transfections were carried out by electroporation at 250 V and 1,500 F with the Celljet electroporator ( Eurogentec ) .
CAT assay .
CEM cells were transiently transfected with the LTRgrriv1y CAT , Ffi-pCAT3 ( -2167 ) , F3pCAT3 ( -98 ) , or F4-pCAT3 ( -44 ) construct ( 20 g ) or cotransfected with the same plasmids and the SV40-Tax construct ( 5 pg ) by a previously published procedure ( 27 ) .
They were incubated at 37°C for 48 h and then harvested .
After centrifugation at 300 x g for 3 min , the cell pellets were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
The cells were disintegrated by four rounds of freezing and thawing .
After centrifugation , aliquots of the clear supernatant were tested for the CAT protein by a CAT antigen capture assay ( Boehringer ) .
An internal control was made available with the kit that allows quantification of the CAT enzyme contained in the extracts .
In some experiments , JPX-9 cells transiently transfected with LTR ( gyry-y-CAT , F { I-pCAT3 ( -2167 ) , F3pCAT3 ( -98 ) , or F4-pCAT3 ( -44 ) construct ( 20 pg ) were cultured for 48 h at 37°C in medium alone or in medium containing cadmium and the CAT assay was performed by the published method ( 37 ) .
Briefly , the method uses [ » HJacetyl coenzyme as the acetyl donor , and relies on the diffusion of labelled acetylchloramphenicol into a water-immiscible liquid scintillation cock-tail .
The quantity of [ *HJacetylchloramphenicol produced was measured directly by counting the samples at selected time intervals .
RT-PCR assay .
PCR detection of retrotranscribed RNAs was performed by a previously published procedure with slight modifications ( 28 ) .
Briefly , total RNA was extracted in guanidinium thiocyanate from 4 % 10° cells and resuspended in 50 ul of H , O0-0.1 % diethylpyrocarbonate .
To reduce the amount of DNA originating from lysis , supernatants were treated with 10 U of RNase-free DNase ( Boehringer ) per pl for 30 min at 20°C and then for 5 min at 65°C .
To 2 ug of RNA sample ( 10 pl ) was added 200 ng of oligo ( dT ) primer ( 1 wl ) for 10 min at 65°C .
Each sample was made up with reaction buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 8.3 ] , 30 mM KCI , 8 mM MgCl , , 9 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 320 nM deoxynucleoside triphosphate ) to a final volume of 25 pl , supplemented with 20 U of RNase inhibitor ( Boehringer ) and 25 U of avian myeloblastosis virus ( AMV ) reverse transcriptase ( Boehringer ) , and incubated for 90 min at 42°C .
PCRs were carried out on 4 pul of the sample supplemented with an amplification mixture containing 20 pmol of each of the oligonucleotide primers and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase .
The amplification reaction was run in a PHC2 thermal cycler ( Techne , Cam-bridge , United Kingdom ) .
The amplified products were electrophoresed in a 1 % agarose gel , blotted , and hybridized with a y-*°P-labeled probe .
Labeled DNA products were visualized by autoradiography .
Flow cytometry analysis .
After two washes with PBS , 5 X 10° cells were suspended in 100 pl of PBS containing a saturating amount of unconjugated MAb and 5 % goat serum ( Gibco ) and then incubated in ice for 45 min .
After two washes with PBS , the cells were incubated for 30 min in ice with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig ( Dako ) in PBS with 5 % goat serum .
After an additional three washes in PBS , the cells were resuspended in 1 % paraformaldehyde .
A Becton Dickinson ( Mountain View , Calif. ) FACScan was used to identify fluorescence-labeled cells .
Integrated fluorescence of the gated population was measured , and data were collected from at least 10,000 events .
For analysis following PDTC treatment , the cells were labeled with 5 ug of propidium iodide ( Sigma ) per ml for 10 min at 4°C by the DNA-labeling technique .
Dead cells labeled with propidium iodide were excluded from the analysis .
Western blot analysis .
The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS , harvested in 1 ml of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer , scraped , and then boiled for 3 min .
Equal amounts of lysates ( 30 ug ) were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-7.5 % polyacrylamide gels .
The fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( BA 85 ; Schleicher & Schiill , Dassel , Germany ) with a semidry-blotting device ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , Calif. ) .
Membranes were then blocked with a 10 % nonfat millk-0.1 % Tween 20-PBS solution for 1 h at room temperature and probed with the appropriate antibody for 1 h. They were then rinsed with PBS-0.1 % Tween 20 and incubated at room temperature with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 1 h. Following four additional rinses in PBS-0.1 % Tween 20 , blots were developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Luminol reagent [ CovalAb , Oullins , France ] ) .
The membranes were subjected to autoradiography with Hyperfilm MP ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , 111 ) .

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a published method ( 6 ) .
Briefly , cells ( 2 x 10° ) were extensively washed and harvested after a 16-h incubation at 37°C in culture medium ( or medium supplemented with additives ) .
The cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ; pH 7.8 ) , transferred into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes , and microcentrifuged at 4°C for 15 s. The pellet was resuspended in 800 pl of buffer A ( 10 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCl , , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 4 ug of leupeptin per ml , 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7.8 ] ) .
After 15 min on ice , a 50-pl solution of 10 % Nonidet P-40 was added to the sample and the cells were homogenized by vortexing and microcentrifuged at 4°C for 30 s. The pellets were resuspended in 100 l of buffer B ( 50 mM KCI , 300 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 4 ug of leupeptin per ml , 10 % glycerol , 50 mM HEPES [ pH 7.8 ] ) .
The nuclear extracts were microcentrifuged at 4°C for 5 min , and the supernatants were stored at -80°C until used .
The NF- « B mobility shift assays were performed with 2 ug of protein from nuclear extract , 10° cpm of radiolabeled double-stranded probe NF- « B ( NF-kB sense strand only : CCTC-3 ' ) in buffer C ( 100 mM KCI , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM ZnSO , , 20 % glycerol , 0.01 % Nonidet P-40 , 50 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] ) , supplemented with bovine serum albumin , tRNA , and poly ( dI-dC ) in a final volume of 20 pI .
After 20 min at room temperature , the mixture was run at 120 V in a 10 % polyacrylamide gel .
The specificity of binding was determined by competition with 10- , 50- , and 100-fold molar excesses of the same unlabeled NF- « B double-stranded oligonucleotide sequence or unrelated Sp-1 oligonucleotide ( Sp-1 sense strand only : 5-GGA GGCGTGGCCTGGGCGGGACTGGGGAGTGGCGA- » ) .
RESULTS Expression of VCAM-1 by HTLV-1-infected human T cells and by Jurkat clones stably transformed with Tax expression plasmids .
Analysis of the expression of adhesion molecules by HTLV-1-transformed T cells ( C8166 and MT2 ) allowed us to show that these cells are expressing VCAM-1 , as ascertained either by flow cytometry with MAb 1G11 or 1.4C3 to CD106 ( Fig .
1 ) or by immunofluorescence ( data not shown ) .
Likewise , freshly isolated T cells from one HAM/TSP patient were found to express VCAM-1 together with CD25 ( Fig .
2A ) .
In contrast , VCAM-1 was not detected on T cells derived from one normal ( HTLV-1-seronegative ) blood donor , even when they were activated with phytohemagglutinin and cultivated in the presence of IL-2 .
As expected , these cells were expressing CD25 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Since Tax is the only viral protein expressed by C8166 cells and it is expressed by T cells from HAM/TSP patients , the role played by this viral regulatory protein in the induction of VCAM-1 was next investigated by using Jurkat T cells that stably express Tax .
Three clones of Jurkat cells , clones C11 and E12 , which express both Tax and Rex , and clone 50 , which expresses only Tax , were found to express VCAM-1 at a level comparable to that observed for HTLV-1-transformed T cells J. Viror .
( Fig .
3A ) .
Parental Jurkat cells as well as cells from a Tax-negative Jurkat clone , C9 ( obtained under the same selection procedure as the Tax-positive clones ) , did not express VCAM-1 ( Fig .
3A ) .
Western blot analysis performed under nonreducing conditions with a blotting MAb directed against VCAM-1 revealed the presence of a protein of approximately 97 kDa in extracts of Tax-positive C11 , E12 , 50 , and C8166 T cells ( Fig .
3B , lanes 3 to 6 , respectively ) .
The molecular weight of this protein is consistent with the seven Ig-like domains of the VCAM-1 molecule .
No such protein could be detected in extracts of parental Jurkat and C9 cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) .
These results clearly suggest that Tax expression in Jurkat cells correlates with the induction of VCAM-1 at the cell surface .
VCAM-1 expression is dependent on the Tax concentration in T cells .
To further evaluate the effect of Tax on VCAM-1 gene expression , we next used JPX-9 cells , a subclone of Jurkat cells that was stably transformed with the pMAXRHneo-1 plasmid carrying the fax sequences under the control of the human metallothionein promoter responsive to heavy-metal ions .
Previous experiments performed with JPX-9 cells transiently transfected with an LTR construct and cultivated in a medium with increasing concentrations of cadmium chloride ( CdCl ; ) have indeed indicated a positive correlation between the expression of a functionally active Tax and the concentration of heavy-metal ions .
Expression of the VCAM-1 gene was assayed by RT-PCR performed on total mRNA extracted after a 24-h culture of cells either in medium alone or in medium containing 5 or 10 wM CdCl ; with or without 100 wM PDTC , an antioxidant which has been shown to block the mobilization of by Tax ( 45 ) .
In untreated cells , VCAM-1 mRNA was undetect-able , whereas the constitutive expression of the TK gene , used as a control , was observed .
After treatment of JPX-9 cells with CdCl , VCAM-1 mRNA was readily detected at both Cd** concentrations ( Fig .
4 ) .

Analysis of cell surface VCAM-1 expression by Tax-expressing cells .
( A ) For a flow cytometry analysis , Jurkat parental cells , a Tax-negative Jurkat clone ( C9 ) , and Tax-positive Jurkat clones ( C11 , E12 , and clone 50 ) were labeled with a MAb to VCAM-1 ( 1G11 ) for 30 min at 4°C and incubated with an FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig for an additional 30 min .
Fluorescence profiles are shown as dark histograms after labeling with the VCAM-1 MAb and as light histograms after labeling with an IgG1 isotype control .
The results are representative of 3 to 10 separate experiments .
( B ) For an immunoblot analysis , lysates prepared from parental Jurkat and C9 cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and from Tax-positive T cells , C11 , E12 , 50 , and C8166 ( lanes 3 to 6 ) , were electrophoresed through an SDS-7.5 % polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane .
The membrane was incubated first with a VCAM-1 MAb ( 1.4C3 ) , then with a rabbit anti-Tax antiserum and with a rabbit anti-actin antiserum , and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig antibody .
Proteins were revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system and after exposure of the membrane to hyperfilms .
VCAM-1 was next analyzed by flow cytometry .
In addition to that of VCAM-1 ( CD106 ) , the expression of CD4 and that of B7 ( CD80 ) , a Tax-inducible membrane antigen ( used as a positive control ) , were determined on JPX-9 cells cultured for 48 h in medium alone or in medium containing either ZnCl ; or CdCl ; , .
The same analysis ( except for B7 ) performed with parental Jurkat T cells cultured in medium alone or in medium containing ZnCl , revealed that VCAM-1 could not be induced in these cells ( Fig .
5A ) .
In untreated JPX-9 cells , neither VCAM-1 nor B7 ( CD80 ) was expressed ( Fig .
5 ) .
Following Tax induction by CdCl , or ZnCl , , JPX-9 cells expressing either VCAM-1 or B7 were detected , at a percentage about fourfold higher for cells treated with ZnCl , ( Fig .
5B ) than for those treated with CdCl , ( Fig .
5C ) .
No increase in the number of JPX-9 cells expressing CD4 was observed following Tax induc-tion .
These results , in agreement with data obtained by RT-PCR analysis , confirmed that Tax is involved in the induced expression of VCAM-1 in T cells .
Functional analysis of the VCAM-1 promoter for transactivation by Tax .
To further ascertain the role of Tax in the transcriptional activation of the VCAM-1 gene , we next attempted to localize the Tax-responsive elements in the VCAM-1 promoter .
To this end , three deletion constructs that contained portions of the VCAM-1 5'-flanking sequences , -2167 ( Ff1 ) , =-98 ( F3 ) , and -44 ( F4 ) , linked to the promot-erless CAT gene were transiently transfected by electroporation either into CEM lymphoblastoid T cells or into JPX-9 cells ( Fig .
6A ) .
To examine the effects of Tax , CEM cells were cotransfected with a Tax expression plasmid whereas JPX-9 cells were treated with CdCJ , .
As shown in Fig .
6B , CAT assays performed 48 h after transfection revealed that Tax strongly induced the expression of the CAT reporter gene in CEM cells transfected with the Ff1 and F3 constructs , indicating that the sequences in the -2167 to -98 region are dispensable for Tax transactivation of the VCAM-1 promoter .
However , with re gard to JPX-9 cells transfected with the same constructs and treated with CdCl ; , , CAT assays reveal that a responsive element appears to exist in the region extending from positions -2167 to =98 of the promoter ( Fig .
6C ) .

PCR analysis of retrotranscribed VCAM-1 mRNA in JPX-9 cells cultured in medium alone ( lane 2 ) or medium containing 5 M ( lane 3 ) or 10 M ( lane 4 ) CdCl ; was performed with the VCAM-1 oligonucleotide primer pair ( see Materials and Meth-ods ) .
Amplified products were electrophoresed , blotted , and hybridized with an -*°P-labelled VCAM-1 probe .
Labelled DNA products were visualized by autoradiography .
Autoradiograms of PCR amplification of retrotranscribed Tax mRNA and thymidine kinase ( TK ) mRNA are shown as controls .

Flow cytometry analysis of cell surface VCAM-1 expression by JPX9 cells and by parental Jurkat T cells .
In addition to that of VCAM-1 ( CD106 ) , the expression of CD4 and that of B7 ( CD80 ) were determined on Jurkat T cells cultured for 48 h in medium alone or medium containing ZnCl , ( A ) or on JPX-9 cells cultured for 48 h in medium alone or medium containing either ZnCl , ( B ) or CdCl ; ( C ) .
Cells were labeled with an isotype control IgG1 MAb , with an anti-CD4 MAb ( IOT4 ) , with an anti-B7 MAb ( 104 ) ( except for parental Jurkat T cells ) , and with an anti-VCAM-1 MAb ( 1G11 ) for 30 min at 4°C and incubated with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig for an additional 30 min .
Fluorescence profiles before treatment are shown as controls .
Where relevant , the percentage of positive cells is indicated .
which might be related to a difference in the efficiency of Tax either transiently or stably expressed , warrants further investi-gations .
For both types of cells transfected with the F4 construct , no induction of CAT activity by Tax was observed , suggesting that the major Tax-responsive elements in the VCAM-1 promoter were found between -98 and -44 .
Interestingly , this region has been shown to contain two sequences , one at -57 and the other at -72 , that each conform to consensus NF-kB elements ( 36 ) .
To investigate which of these elements is essential to Tax-induced VCAM-1 expression , we used two mutant constructs generated from the F3 deletion plasmid ( F3mA and F3mB ) .
Transfection experiments performed as described above indicated that with the upstream F3mA construct , no CAT activity was induced in presence of Tax .
The same results were obtained with the F3mB mutant .
These data clearly demonstrate that the Tax-induced expression of the VCAM-1 gene is mediated by the two NF-kB consensus binding sites present in the -98 to -44 region of the core promoter .
Tax induces VCAM-1 expression through the NF-KB pathway .
Since Tax is known to intervene in the nuclear translocation of the NF-kB family of transcription factors , we next performed gel shift assays to demonstrate the specific binding of nuclear proteins to the two sites .
A labeled oligonucleotide encompassing these two elements was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared either from parental Jurkat cells or from JPX-9 cells , both cell types being either left uninduced or treated with 5 M CdCl ; , .
As shown in Fig .
7 , lane 4 , a significant increase in the shift of the labeled oligonucleotide was observed when it was mixed with extracts of treated JPX-9 cells compared with extracts prepared either from untreated JPX-9 cells ( lane 3 ) or from parental Jurkat cells that were untreated ( lane 1 ) or treated with CdCl ; ( lane 2 ) .
The addition of a 10- , 50- , or 100-fold molecular excess of unlabeled NF- « B oligonucleotide decreased the formation of the Tax-inducible DNA-protein complex ( lanes 7 to 9 ) .
In contrast , no such inhibition was observed after incubation of the nuclear proteins and the labeled oligonucleotide in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Sp-1 oligonucleotide ( lane 10 ) .
A significant reduction in the amount of the DNA-protein complex was also observed with nuclear extracts prepared from JPX-9 cells treated with CdCJ ; , and with 100 M PDTC ( lane 3 ) .
Finally , treatment of Tax-expressing Jurkat T cells with increasing concentrations of PDTC led to a dose-dependent decrease in VCAM-1 expression .
Thus , VCAM-1 expression was inhibited by more than 75 % at the highest concentration of PDTC ( 100 wM ) .
Such an effect did not correlate with a decreased functionality of Tax , since Tax was found to be still able to trans-activate the HTLV-1 LTR ( data not shown ) .
Collectively , these results confirm the presence of nuclear proteins binding specifically to the two NF- « xB consensus sites of the VCAM-1 gene promoter in Tax-expressing T cells .
They further underline that these two sites are responsible for the Tax-mediated induction of the VCAM-1 expression on HTLV-1-infected T cells .
DISCUSSION Infiltration of T lymphocytes carrying the HTLV-1 provirus into organs represents a crucial event in the evolution of lymphoproliferative and inflammatory diseases associated with HTLV-1 infection .
Indeed , numerous studies have underlined voL .

Analysis of Tax-responsive elements in the VCAM-1 promoter .
( A ) Schematic diagram , adapted from reference 36 , of the fusion plasmids containing portions of VCAM-1 -flanking sequence with or without deletion mutations in the regulatory regions and the CAT reporter gene .
( B ) CEM cells were transfected with VCAM-1 wild-type Ff1-pCAT3 construct , deletion plasmids F3-pCAT3 ( -98 ) and F4-pCAT3 ( -44 ) , or mutant F3mA-pCAT3 or F3mB-pCAT3 construct or cotransfected with one of these constructs and a Tax expression vector , as indicated in Materials and Methods .
Promoter transactivation was evaluated by measuring CAT antigen synthesis by a CAT antigen capture assay .
Bars represent the average value of two independent experiments .
( C ) JPX-9 cells transfected with the same reporter plasmids as in panel B were cultured in medium supplemented or not supplemented with CdCl ; .
Promoter transactivation was evaluated by measuring the [ *HJacetylchloramphenicol produced , as described in Materials and Methods .
We provisionally considered the transactivation of VCAM-1 wild-type ( Ff1 ) promoter by Tax to be 100 % transactivation to allow comparison of panels A and B .
Under similar experimental conditions , transactivation of LTR -y by Tax used as internal control was 107.5 % + 17.5 % .
the role of adhesion molecules , not only in mediating cell-cell interactions but also in mediating tissue invasion ( 18 , 20-22 , 25 , 50 , 55 ) .
In the present report , we demonstrate that VCAM-1 , an adhesion molecule that is a member of the Ig gene superfamily , is expressed on in vitro HTLV-1-transformed T cells , on T cells from one HAM/TSP patient , and on Jurkat T cells stably expressing the viral regulatory Tax protein .
We also demonstrate that Tax activates VCAM-1 transcription mainly via the two NF-KB sites present in the promoter of the VCAM-1 gene .
Among the in vitro HTLV-1-transformed T cells examined in this study and which were found to express VCAM-1 , C8166 cells were known to harbor a deleted HTLV-1 provirus .
Because the only viral protein synthesized by these cells is Tax , we next investigated its role in the expression of this adhesion molecule by HTLV-1-infected T cells .
Indeed , this regulatory protein has been shown to induce the transcriptional activation of cellular genes involved in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection ( 10 , 56 ) .
To this end , we have used three clones of the human Jurkat T-cell line which share the property to stably express Tax and found that VCAM-1 was present on these cells .
Furthermore , induction of Tax in JPX-9 cells , a subclone of Jurkat cells stably transformed with a plasmid carrying the tax gene under the control of the inducible human metallothionein promoter , led to the expression of VCAM-1 .
These results clearly stress that Tax is responsible for the induction of VCAM-1 on HTLV-1-infected T cells .
Indeed , with the exception of a subset of anergized autoreactive T cells bearing TCR-y8 ( 26 ) , VCAM-1 has never been reported to be expressed by resting or activated T lymphocytes .
As such , the present observations indicate a unique effect of Tax in the expression of an adhesion molecule , since other studies have shown that ICAM-1 , LFA-3 and L-selectin expressed by normal T cells are upregulated by Tax on T cells carrying proviral HTLV-1 ( 50 , 52 ) .
Finally , it should be underlined that HTLV-1-transformed T cells constitutively express both VCAM-1 and its ligand VLA-4 ( 8 ) .
The same is true for OX40 and its ligand gp34 , which are both detected on the membrane of Tax-expressing T lymphocytes ( 23 ) .

Induction of NF- « B-binding proteins in JPX-9 cells after treatment with CdCl , .
Nuclear extracts prepared from JPX-9 cells cultured in medium alone ( lane 3 ) or in medium containing 5 M CdCl , ( lane 4 ) or 5 aM CdCl , and 100 M PDTC ( lane 5 ) were reacted with a double-stranded oligonucleotide NF- « B probe .
The specificity of binding of nuclear extracts prepared from JPX-9 cells cultured in medium containing 5 wM CdCl , to NF- « B probe was determined by competition with a 10- , 50- , and 100-fold molar excess of cither the same unlabeled double-stranded NF-B oligonucleotide sequence ( lanes 7 to 9 ) or 100-fold unlabeled double-stranded Sp-1 oligonucleotide ( lanes 10 ) .
Nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat cells cultured in medium alone ( lane 1 ) or in medium containing 5 M CdCl ; ( lane 2 ) reacted with a double-stranded oligonucleotide NF- « B probe are shown as controls .
VCAM-1 gene , performed with the respective CAT reporter constructs transfected either in CEM cells in the presence of a Tax expression plasmid or in JPX-9 cells either induced or left uninduced , revealed that Tax was inducing VCAM-1 expression in a B-dependent manner .
Indeed , these experiments indicated that the -98 to -44 region of the VCAM-1 promoter , which contained two sequences that conform to consensus NF-kB elements , is indispensable for Tax-induced expression of VCAM-1 .
Next , transfection of two CAT constructs , each carrying the -98 to -44 region mutated in either NF- « kB-like site , indicated that both of them were strictly required for Tax induction of this adhesion molecule .
Furthermore , gel shift assays performed with nuclear extracts obtained from either induced or uninduced JPX-9 cells confirmed that Tax induction correlated with the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes in the presence of an oligonucleotide spanning these two NF- « B-like sequences .
Finally , a decrease in the formation of these protein-DNA complexes was found to be linked to a decrease in the expression of VCAM-1 by induced JPX-9 cells treated with the antioxidant PDTC , which abolished oxidative processes involved in the activation of this transcription factor .
VCAM-1 was first identified as an adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of IL-1- or TNF- « -stimulated endothelial cells ( 9 , 40 ) .
Previous studies have established that the two NF- « B sites of the VCAM-1 promoter were required for induction of VCAM-1 transcription by these inflammatory cyto- J. Viror .
kines ( 36 ) .
Interestingly , these two sites were not responsive in Jurkat T cells treated with TNF- « , even though NF- « B elements present in other promoters were activated by TNF-a in these human T cells ( 19 , 33 , 36 , 46 ) .
These observations therefore indicated that NF-kB subunits specific of endothelial cells were involved in the response of the VCAM-1 promoter to TNF- « .
Experiments performed to ascertain whether IL-1 or IL-6 added to Jurkat T cells might be able to induce VCAM-1 expression consistently gave negative results ( data not shown ) .
Our present results indicate for the first time that these two NF- « B subunits are implicated in the induction of the VCAM-1 gene in Tax-positive T cells .
As underlined above , VCAM-1 was first identified as an adhesion molecule induced on endothelial cells by inflammatory cytokines .
Indeed , quiescent endothelial cells normally exhibit a low affinity for circulating lymphocytes .
The release of cytokines at sites of inflammation results in the upregulation of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells and the subsequent establishment of interactions of VCAM-1 with VLA-4 expressed on T lymphocytes , with this ligand-receptor pair allowing the attachment of lymphocytes to activated endothelium .
Whether or not VCAM-1 expressed on HTLV-l-infected T lymphocytes is playing a major role in recruiting these cells from the peripheral blood and in mediating their passage into organs remains questionable , inasmuch as the « 4 chain specifying the VLA-4 molecule was not found to be expressed by quiescent or stimulated endothelial cells .
Although it might be postulated that an alternative counterreceptor for VCAM-1 on endothelial cells is promoting the adhesion and invasion of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes , VCAM-1 might rather favor the interaction of HTLV-1-infected T cells among themselves and with uninfected T cells expressing VLA-4 .
Such interactions may lead to cell fusion , transmission of HTLV-1 , and/or immuno-logical destruction of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes .
Recently VCAM-1 has been demonstrated to be involved as an accessory molecule or potential coreceptor for HTLV-1-induced cell fusion ( 16 ) .
Soon after its identification on activated endothelial cells , VCAM-1 was also found on nonendothe-lial cells , such as lymphoid dendritic cells , tissue macrophages , glial cells , muscle cells ( 1 , 5 , 30 , 42 , 43 ) .
In particular , VCAM-1 on myoblasts and myotubes and VLA-4 induced during myo-tube formation were shown to play a role in secondary myo-genesis ( 43 ) .
A recent report indicates that HTLV-1 -associated inflammatory polymyositis is not due to direct infection of the muscle fiber by the virus but , rather , to a T-cell-mediated and major histocompatibility complex class T-restricted immuno-pathological process such as myocytotoxicity ( 29 ) .
Thus , it is tempting to speculate that HTLV-1-infected T cells expressing VCAM-1 and infiltrating muscles may perturb the myogenic process at the origin of muscle disorders that have been described in some patients suffering from HAM/TSP .
The numerous studies devoted to the role of adhesion molecules have indicated that activation of leukocytes by various stimuli leads to different utilizations of adhesion pathways .
In this perspective , the results presented here provide a novel example in which activation of an adhesion molecule such as VCAM-1 induced by a viral protein may represent a crucial event in the initiation and development of lesions associated with a retroviral infection in humans .
