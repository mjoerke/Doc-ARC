We asked whether dexamethasone ( Dex ) and cyclosporin A ( CsA ) inhibit IL-2 gene transcription by interfering with the activity of nuclear proteins that bind to the IL-2 promoter .
Nuclear extracts from primary human T lymphocytes were analyzed by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays .
Both Dex and CsA inhibited the binding of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT , but not of NF-kB and OCT-1/OAF , to their corresponding sites on the IL-2 gene promoter .
To correlate changes in nuclear factor binding in vitro with transcriptional activity in vivo and define the structural requirements for IL-2 promoter repression , we used transient DNA transfections .
Jurkat cells were transfected with plasmids containing either the intact IL-2 promoter or its AP-1 , NF-AT , and NF-kB motifs .
Dex inhibited the IL-2 promoter and the AP-1 , but not the NF-AT and NF-kB plasmids .
In contrast , CsA inhibited the IL-2 promoter and the NF-AT , but not the AP-1 and NF-kB plasmids .
These results suggest that in human T lymphocytes both Dex and CsA inhibited IL-2 gene transcription through interference with transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT .
We propose that , while maximum inhibition may involve interaction with both transcription factors , AP-1 is the primary target of Dex .

In spite of their widespread medical use , the mechanism of their inhibitory effects has not been completely de-fined .
We have recently reported that dexamethasone ( Dex ) , a synthetic GC hormone , inhibits the nuclear transcription of IL-2 gene in primary human T lymphocytes ( 2 ) .
IL-2 gene transcription is mediated by a region extending ~ 326 bp upstream of the transcription start site .
This promoter region contains binding sites for at least seven nuclear proteins ( Fig .
1 ; references 3-9 ) .
Analysis of the IL-2 promoter has not revealed any cis-reacting sequences ( glucocorticoid response elements , GRE ) for binding of the activated GC receptor and negative transcriptional regulation ( 10 ) .
Thus , delineation of the mechanism of negative transcriptional regulation of IL-2 promoter has been the subject of active investigation over the last two years .
Even though several recent publications have explored this area in transformed human or mouse lymphocytes ( 11 , 12 ) , the mechanisms of GC-mediated inhibition of IL-2 gene transcription in primary human T lymphocytes remain un-known .
Using electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) and transient DNA transfection assays , we have examined whether interference with activity of nuclear proteins binding to IL-2 promoter may explain the inhibitory effects of GC on IL-2 nuclear transcription .
To better understand the effect of GC on primary human T lymphocytes , we have also examined their effect on transiently transfected transformed T lymphocytes with reporter constructs containing specific IL-2 promoter motifs and have compared it with the effect of another unrelated inhibitor of IL-2 gene transcription , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) ( 13-17 ) .
Our data suggest that in primary human T lymphocytes GC and CsA inhibit IL-2 gene transcription by interfering with transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT .
Our data also suggest that while AP-1 is the primary target for GC-mediated repression of IL-2 gene transcription , NF-AT appears to be the main target of CsA action .
Methods Cell cultures .
Human PBMC were obtained and purified by gradient centrifugation over lymphocyte separation medium ( Organon Tek-nica , Durham , NC ) from leukapheresis of normal volunteers by the Department of Transfusion Medicine , Clinical Center , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
Cells were aspirated from the resulting interface and washed three times in PBS without Ca** or Mg** .
PBMC were depleted of macrophages by fractionation in Sepracell-MN ( Sepratech , Oklahoma City , OK ) , according to the instructions of the manufac-turer .
Monocyte-depleted cells were collected , washed in PBS , and ro-setted with 2-aminoethyliso-thiouronium bromide pretreated sheep red blood cells ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) and separated over lymphocyte separation medium .
E ( + ) cells were resuspended at a density of 5 X 10°/ml in medium consisting of RPMI 1640 ( Gibco , Mechanism of Immunosuppression by Glucocorticoids __ 1481 -257 -256 - -2M42 -28 sw OCT-1 - 188 - ~186 -177 -10 NF-AT NF-xB AP-1 - 164 - 146 -110 CD2BRC AP-1 NRE-A Figure 1 .

of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA , Sigma Chemical Co. ) , M Dex ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) and 100 to 1 ng/ml of CsA ( Sandoz , Basel , Switzerland ) .
Cells were preincubated with Dex for > 8 h and with CsA for > 0.5 h before stimulation .
Human Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI-1 640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS , 25 ug/ml gentamicin , and 5 x 10 ~ ' M 2-mercaptocth-anol ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) .
Nuclear extracts .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from 2 x 10° T-lymphocytes by a modification of the method of Dignam et al .
( 18 ) .
Briefly , cells were washed once with PBS and twice with buffer A ( 10 mM Hepes , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KCl , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) .
The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 al of buffer A/0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , incubated 10 min on ice , mixed briefly , and spun in a microcentrifuge ( full speed ) for 10 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was removed and the nuclear pellet was suspended in 20 ul of buffer C ( 20 mM Hepes , 25 % glycerol , 0.42 M KCI , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) , incubated 15 min at 4°C , mixed briefly , and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was diluted with equal volume of modified buffer D ( 20 mM Hepes , 20 % glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM PMSF , 0.5 mM DTT ) ( 18 ) .
The protein concentration in the nuclear extracts was determined by using the Bradford assay ( 19 ) .
DNA-protein binding assay .
End-labeled DNA fragments ( 0.2-0.5 ng , ~ 2 X 10° ) cpm were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 5 to 10 Lg of nuclear protein in the presence of 4 ug poly-dI-dC in 15 l of buffer .
Two buffers were used : Buffer I ( 10 mM Tris HCl , pH 7.5 ; 50 mM NaCl ; 1 mM DDT ; and 5 % glycerol ) was used for NF-kB and NF-AT EMSA .
Buffer II ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 ; 2.5 mM MgC ) ; ; 40 mM KCI ; 1 mM DTT ; and 4 % Ficoll ) was used for AP-1 and OCT-1 .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 % Tris borate buffer at 150 V for 1.5 h at room temperature .
The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film .
Specificity of binding was determined by using 20-fold excess of specific cold oligonucleotide , which competed the binding of the proteins to radiolabeled probe , whereas a similar excess of unrelated oligonucleotide did not compete .
To determine whether the binding of proteins to the AP-1 site contained c-Jun or c- fos protein , nuclear extracts from stimulated cells were incubated with 0.1 ug of purified c-jun rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody against the DNA binding site of the protein ( Oncogene Science , Inc. , Uniondale , NY ) , 1 ul of anti-jun antibody 636/5 provided by Dr. R. Bravo ( Bristol-Myers , Squibb Institute , Princeton , NJ ) ( 20 ) , 0.1 ug of purified anti- fos rabbit polyclonal antibody against the NH -terminal domain of c-fos ( Oncogene Science ) , or 0.1 ug normal rabbit immunoglobulin before addition of the labeled AP-1 probe .
DNA probes .
The oligonucleotides were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosystems ; Foster City , CA ) .
Complementary sequences were annealed at 68°C for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature , labeled with [ *P ] ATP , and used for EMSA after gel puri-fication .
The following probes were used , all derived from sequences present in the IL-2 promoter region : For AP-1 binding site from -157 to -140 'TTCCAAAGAGTCATCAG ' ; NF-AT binding site sequences -285 to -254 , 'GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAG-GCGT® ; OCT-1 binding site from -82 to -67 , 'TAATATGTAAAA- CATT } ; and NF-kB binding site from -206 to - 195 , 'GGGATTTCA-CCT ( 21 ) .
Plasmids .
The plasmid pIL-2 CAT ( a gift from Dr. U. Siebenlist , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) contains 632 bp of the 5-flanking sequences of the human IL-2 gene , including 575 bp upstream of the transcription start site through position +57 bp linked to the CAT gene ( 22 ) .
The plasmid AP-1 CAT ( TRE-tk CAT , a gift from Dr. M. Karin , University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , CA ) contains a synthetic oligonucleotide from -7 1 to -65 of the human collagenase gene flanked by HindIII/Bam linker sequences cloned into HindIII / BamHI cut of pBLCAT2 , which contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( HSV -tk ) promoter from position -109 to +51 in front of the CAT structural gene ( 23 ) .
The NF-AT CAT plasmid ( a gift from Dr. G. Crabtree , Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) has three copies of NF-AT binding site containing 5° IL-2 sequences -255 to -285 linked to the IL-2 promoter sequences from -72 to +47 linked to the CAT gene ( 7 ) .
The plasmid NF-Kb ( provided by Dr. U. Siebenlist ) contains the kB site from the IL-2 promoter linked to minimal c- fos promoter inserted at the Sal site at -56 , and drives the expression of the CAT gene ( 24 ) .
The plasmid pCH110 ( Pharmacia Inc. , Piscataway , NJ ) contains a functional lacZ gene , coding for -galactosidase , under the transcriptional control of the SV40 early promoter .
DNA transfections .
Transfections of lymphoid cells were carried out by the DEAE-dextran method ( 4 ) .
To decrease variations in transfection efficiency , cells were transfected in single batches , which were then separated into different drug treatment groups .
As an internal marker for monitoring and normalizing transient expression , cells were transfected with pCH110 .
For each treatment , 1.5-2 x 10 cells harvested in log phase of growth ( 3-5 x 10° cells/ml ) were incubated with 20 ug DNA and 100 ug/ml DEAE-dextran in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium for 50 min at room temperature .
After two washes with serum-free RPMI-1640 medium they were replated in complete medium .
24 h after transfection , cells were treated with various concentrations of Dex > 8 h and for 0.5 h with various concentrations of CsA .
Then they were stimulated for 8 h with ionomycin 1 ug/ml and 30 ng/ml of PMA .
After stimulation , cells were harvested and extracts were prepared by rapid freeze-thawing .
Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay ( 19 ) and equivalent amounts of protein extracts were assayed for enzyme activity .
CAT assay .
CAT assay was carried out as described previously ( 25 ) by incubation of 50 ug of cell lysate protein with 0.1 LCi of [ `` CJ ) -chloramphenicol ( specific activity 57.3 mg/mmol , NEN Research Products , Boston , MA ) in the presence of 9 mM acetyl-coenzyme A ( Pharmacia Inc. ) for 3 h at 37°C .
Acetylated and unacetylated chloramphenicol were separated by thin layer chromatography , and acetyla-tion quantified by autoradiography .
B-galactosidase assay .
Equal amounts of the same cell lysate used for CAT assays were diluted in 100 mM NaPO , , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM MgSo , , 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , pH 7.0 , and -galactosidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 420 nm by the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenol-8-p-galactoside .
Results Dex and CsA inhibit the protein kinase C- and calcium-me-diated trans-activation of the IL-2 promoter .
Both Dex and CsA inhibit the nuclear transcription of the human IL-2 gene ( 2 , 1482 F. Paliogianni , A. Raptis , S. S. Ahuja , S. M. Najjar , and D. T. Boumpas 13-17 ) .
To determine whether their inhibition is mediated through interference with the transcriptional activity of the human IL-2 promoter , Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with plasmid ( p ) IL-2 CAT , which contains the IL-2 promoter region driving the expression of CAT gene ( see Methods ) .
After transfection , cells were incubated with Dex ( 10-10 ~ M ) or CsA ( 1,000 to 0.1 ng/ml ) and stimulated with ionomycin ( 1 ug/ml ) and PMA ( 30 ng/ml ) .
18 h later , cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT activity .
pIL-2 CAT was not expressed in unstimulated Jurkat cells or in cells incubated with Dex or CsA ( Fig .
2 ) .
Stimulation with ionomycin and PMA significantly increased CAT activity .
Both Dex and CsA inhibited the expression of IL-2 CAT after stimulation with ionomycin and PMA in a dose-dependent fashion ( minimum effective dose 10 ~ ' M and 0.1 ng/ml respectively , not shown ) .
Dex at the dose of 10~° M inhibited by a mean of 60 % ( range 54-67 % ) the CAT activity ( three different experiments ) , whereas at 10~ ' M inhibition was ~ 20 % ( range 15-28 % ) .
Inhibition by CsA was as follows : 1,000-10 ng/ml , 100 % ; 1 ng , ~ 80 % , 0.5 ng , ~ 40 % ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that both Dex and CsA inhibit IL-2 gene transcription by interfering with the activity of IL-2 promoter , and that CsA is more potent than Dex ( on a molar to molar basis ) in mediating this inhibition .
Stimulation through ionomycin and PMA induces the activity of nuclear proteins AT , NF-kB , AP-1 and OCT /OAP , all of which are thought to contribute to the transcriptional activation of IL-2 promoter in various degrees ( 7 , 9 , 26 , 27 ) .
Recent data have suggested a functional antagonism between the AP-1 transcriptional factor for the collagenase gene and the activated GR ( 28-30 ) .
We therefore first examined the effect of Dex on the activity of the AP-1 site of the human IL-2 promoter .
Binding of nuclear proteins from stimulated primary human T lymphocytes to the AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter is inhibited by Dex or CsA .

served sequence TGAGTCA functioning as a TPA responsive element ( TRE ) .
This sequence is recognized by the transcriptional factor AP-1 , which is encoded by the cellular proto-oncogene c-jun ( 31-34 ) .
c-fos protein interacts with AP-1 through their `` leucine zipper . ''
This complex binds to the TRE with an affinity 300-fold higher than AP-1 alone , leading to transactivation of AP-1-dependent transcription ( 34 ) .
The human IL-2 promoter contains two TREs , one proximal and one distal .
Footprint and deletion analysis has shown that only proximal TRE binds strongly AP-1 and has revealed its importance in IL-2 enhancer activity ( 7-9 ) .
Human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were therefore stimulated with ionomycin and PMA after preincubation with Dex ( > 8 h ) or CsA ( 0.5 h ) .
Nuclear extracts were isolated 16 h later and analyzed in an EMSA using end-labeled DNA fragment corresponding to the proximal AP-1 site of the IL-2 enhancer .
In agreement with previous observations ( 21 ) , unstimulated T lymphocytes contain little or no AP-1 activity ( Fig .
3 4 ) .
Stimulation of these cells effectively induced AP-1 activity .
The sequence specificity of the binding was assessed by using molar excess of homolo-gous and heterologous oligonucleotide as competitors .
Protein binding to the P-labeled IL-2 AP-1 site was inhibited by a cold homologous , but not with a heterologous ( NF-kB ) oligonucleotide ( see Methods ) .
An antibody raised against a peptide common to the DNA-binding region of Jun proteins , but not an equivalent concentration of normal rabbit immunoglobulin , specifically blocked protein binding , suggesting that it contains Jun protein and identifying it as the AP-1 factor ( Fig .
3 B ) .
An antibody raised against c-fos decreased the mobility of this complex , suggesting that it contains c-fos protein .
Both Dex and CsA inhibited the formation of the AP-1 complex .
Lower concentration of Dex ( 107 ' M ) had little effect ( Fig .
3 4 ) , whereas 10 ~ M had no effect ( not shown ) .
These results suggest that both Dex and CsA inhibit the binding of the AP-1 transcription factor to the AP-1 site of the human IL-2 pro moter .

( A ) Dex and CsA inhibit the binding of nuclear proteins from stimulated primary human T lymphocytes to the AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter .
In EMSA a **P-end-labeled 17-bp DNA probe that included the AP-1 binding domain of the human IL-2 promoter was incubated with nuclear extracts ( 10 ug/lane ) prepared from primary human T lymphocytes resting or stimulated , in the presence or absence of Dex or CsA for 16 h , in buffer II ( see Methods ) .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 x Tris borate buffer .
Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film .
Specificity of binding was determined by the use of a 20-fold excess of specific or unrelated oligonucleotide .

1 ug of affinity purified c-jun ( « Jun ) or c- fos ( « fos ) antibodies , or 0.1 ug of normal rabbit immunoglobulin ( RZ ) before addition of the labeled AP-1 probe .
a Jun binds to the DNA binding site of the protein , thus inhibiting its binding .
The `` supershift '' observed with « Fos is consistent with this antibody binding to the Jun-Fos complex , thus decreasing its mobility .
Dex but not CsA inhibits the in vivo transcriptional activity of a construct containing the AP-1 site .
Jurkat cells were transfected with plasmid AP-1 CAT ( TRE-CAT ) , which contains the AP-1 site of the human collagenase gene cloned into pBLCAT2 ( 23 ) .
Cells were preincubated with Dex ( 10 ~*-10~ M ) or CsA ( 10-1,000 ng/ml ) as described in Methods and stimulated by ionomycin and PMA .
Cell extracts were prepared and assayed 8 , 18 , and 36 h later .
Unstimulated Jurkat cells expressed low but detectable AP-1 CAT activity , which was suppressed by Dex ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast to Dex , CsA failed to suppress the activity of this construct .
As expected , when cells were stimulated with ionomycin and PMA , activity of AP-1 CAT was induced by severalfold .
Dex inhibited the inducible activity of AP-1 CAT by a mean of ~ 70 % ( range 60-80 % ) at 10~° M and ~ 30 % ( range 35-25 % ) at 10~ '' M , when cells 1484 were harvested at 18 h. Similar results were obtained when cells were harvested at 8- and 36-h time points ( not shown ) .
Lower doses of Dex ( 10 ~ M ) did not have a significant effect on AP-1 CAT activity ( not shown ) .
In contrast to Dex , CsA failed to inhibit the inducible activity of AP-1 CAT ( Fig .
5 ) at concentrations that were previously found to be effective for downreg-ulation of IL-2 promoter activity .
Concentrations of CsA as high as 1 ug/ml were not effective ( not shown ) .
Taken together , these results confirm the in vitro data for inhibition of AP-1 by Dex and suggest that this inhibition does not require the presence of other motifs of the IL-2 promoter .
The discrepancy between the in vitro and the in vivo data observed when CsA was used may be due to the difference in cell types ( primary vs. transformed ) .
These data are in agreement with previous reports suggesting that in Jurkat cells AP-1 activity by EMSA or transfection assays is not inhibited by CsA ( 14 , 15 , 17 ) .
Inhibition of AP-1 activity in vitro by CsA in primary human T lymphocytes ( by EMSA ) has also been reported by Granelli-Piperno et al .
( 16 ) .
NF-AT activity in primary human T lymphocytes is inhibited by Dex or CsA .
In contrast to nuclear factor AP-1 , which is ubiquitous , NF-AT has been found only in lymphoid cells ( 27 ) .
Unstimulated primary human T lymphocytes contain no detectable activity for NF-AT as determined by EMSA .
In stimulated T lymphocytes NF-AT activity appears within 6 h after stimulation and continues to increase until it reaches a peak within ~ 36 h ( 21 ) .
Induction of NF-AT in transformed human T lymphocytes requires two activation-dependent effects : a CsA-sensitive translocation of a preexisting cytoplasmic component to the nucleus and a CsA-resistant synthesis of a nuclear component ( 35 ) .
Recent data in murine T lymphocytes suggest that the CsA-insensitive nuclear component is AP-1 ( which is added to the preexisting NF-AT complex ) and that there is close physical and functional interaction ( crosstalk ) between AP-1 and NF-AT ( 36 ) .
We therefore examined the effect of Dex on NF-AT activity .
Primary human T lymphocytes were stimulated by ionomycin and PMA in the presence of Dex or CsA .
Nuclear extracts were isolated 18 and 36 h later and analyzed by EMSA using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe for the AT site of the human IL-2 promoter .
Unstimulated cells did not exhibit any AT activity ( Fig .
5 ) .
Stimulation of cells resulted in induction of AT activity , which was inhibited by both Dex or CsA at 36 h ( Fig .
5 ) .
Analysis at 8 and 18 h revealed similar results .
Binding of nuclear proteins was sequence specific , as demonstrated by competition assays with related and unrelated ( NF-kB ) DNA ( Fig .
5 ) .
Inhibition of NF-AT activity by CsA in primary human T lymphocytes corroborates previous findings in both primary and transformed T lymphocytes ( 14-16 ) .
CsA but not Dex inhibits the transcriptional activity of a transfected plasmid containing the AT site in Jurkat cells .
NF-AT activity is inhibited by Dex in vitro .
We examined these phenomena in vivo by transfection assays .
Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with pNF-AT CAT , which contains three copies of the NF-AT site of the human IL-2 promoter linked to the CAT gene ( 5 ) .
Plasmids containing a single copy of the NF-AT site are not inducible ( 5 , 11 , 12 ) .
As shown in Fig .
6 , unstimulated Jurkat cells did not exhibit any detectable CAT activity .
Neither Dex nor CsA affected the baseline activity of this plasmid ( Fig .
6 ) .
Activation of Jurkat cells led to a dramatic induction of pNF-AT CAT .
Dex at 10~° or 10~ ' M did not affect the activity of this plasmid ( Fig .

In contrast to Dex , CsA ( 100 ng/ml ) completely inhibited the activity of pNF-AT CAT .
Doses of CsA as low as 1 ng/ml inhibited the activity of this plasmid ( not shown ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that CsA is a potent inhibitor of NF-AT activity and that its inhibitory effect does not require the presence of other sites of the IL-2 promoter .
Lack of inhibition of pNF-AT activity in vivo by Dex in Jurkat cells could be due to ( a ) resistance of transformed T lymphocytes ( compared with primary T lymphocytes ) ; ( b ) the presence of three NF-AT sites in the plasmid used for these Figure 5 .

experiments instead of a single site in the IL-2 promoter ; or ( c ) to Dex requiring the presence of other sites of the IL-2 promoter in order that it may inhibit NF-AT activity .
Analysis of Jurkat cells by EMSA demonstrated that both Dex ( 10° M ) and CsA inhibit the binding of nuclear proteins to the human NF-AT site of the human IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
7 ) .
When higher concentrations of Dex were used ( 10~° M ) in DNA transfection assays with pNF-AT , CAT results were identical ( not shown ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that the NF-AT site , by itself , is not sufficient for GC mediated inhibition .
Given the highly cooperative interaction among the various transcription factors for the IL-2 gene promoter ( 27 ) , it is possible that additional sites are required in order that NF-AT may confer susceptibility to GC ( see Discussion ) .
Neither Dex nor CsA inhibits the activity of nuclear proteins binding to the OCT site of the human IL-2 promoter .
OCT -1 is a ubiquitous octamer binding nuclear protein that participates in the induction of IL-2 promoter activity by interacting with both DNA and a 40-kD protein called -associated protein ( OAP ) ( 37 ) .
Two octamer-binding sites are identified in the human IL-2 promoter , one proximal and one distal ( Fig .
1 ) .
Protein extracts of stimulated primary T lymphocytes bind very poorly to the OCT -1 distal site ( 21 ) .
In contrast , binding to the proximal OCT is strong .
Levels of OCT -1 activity are low in unstimulated T cells and are induced after stimulation reaching a peak at ~ 6 h ( 21 ) .
As shown in Fig .
8 , unstimulated primary T lymphocytes exhibited low levels of OCT -1 binding activity that were not affected by pretreatment by Dex or CsA ( not shown ) .
Two bands are apparent in this figure , one upper and one lower .
Competition with related cold oligonucleotide ( OCT -1 ) completely inhibited the binding of the label in the upper band , whereas it competed less effectively for binding in the lower band .
Competition with a heterologous ( NF-kB ) oligonucleotide did not exhibit any demonstrable effect on binding of these proteins .
This suggests that upper band is specific for OCT-1 , whereas binding to the lower band represents nonspecific binding .
Both Dex or CsA failed to inhibit the activity of OCT-1/OAP nuclear proteins .
NF-kB activity is not inhibited by Dex or CsA .

In unstimulated human T lymphocytes low to undetectable levels of NF-kB activity are present by EMSA .
Stimulation of T lymphocytes leads to a rapid induction of NF-kB activity , which peaks within 6 h and persists at similar levels for > 36 hours ( 21 ) .

We next determined whether Dex or CsA will inhibit NF-kB activity in Jurkat cells .
Plasmid NF-kB CAT , which contains a single copy of the human IL-2 kB site , was transfected into Jurkat cells .
Neither Dex or CsA inhibited the induction of NF-kB activity by ionomycin and PMA ( not shown ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that NF-kB is not likely to mediate inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity by Dex .
Lack of inhibition of NF-kB activity by CsA has been reported also by Granelli-Piperno et al .
( 16 ) , whereas other groups have reported partial inhibition ( 14 , 17 ) .
Discussion We have presented a series of studies aimed at defining the mechanism ( s ) of GC-mediated inhibition of IL-2 gene nuclear transcription in primary human T lymphocytes .
To better understand this inhibition and put the effect of GC in perspective , we have also studied transformed human T lymphocytes ( Jur-kat cells ) and have compared the effects of GC with those of CsA .
Our results suggest that inhibition of IL-2 transcription by GC , both in primary and transformed human T lymphocytes , is mediated by interference with nuclear factors AP-1 and AT .
Furthermore , our data suggest that while maximum inhibition of IL-2 promoter transcription may involve interaction with both transcription factors , AP-1 seems to be the primary target of GC because , in contrast to NF-AT , its inhibition does not require the presence of other motifs of the IL-2 promoter .
Fi-nally , we have shown that inhibition of IL-2 transcription by CsA in primary T lymphocytes involves interference with both NF-AT and AP-1 , whereas in Jurkat cells inhibition is mediated mainly through NF-AT .
Our results are reminiscent of findings recently reported by Vacca et al .
( 11 ) .
By mutational analysis of human IL-2 promoter in a system using transfection in Jurkat cells , these investigators found that mutants carrying deletions disrupting the NF-AT and the proximal AP-1i -like motif impaired their ability to be inhibited by GC .
A homooligomer of NF-AT was found to be inducible by ionomycin and PMA .
Dex did not inhibit the activity of the construct .
When an AP-1 motif con-catemer was used , calcium ionophores and PMA failed to induce it significantly .
Based on these results , they concluded that the AP-1 motif confers GC sensitivity to a flanking region containing an NF-AT element and suggested that , in order that GC may inhibit IL-2 gene transcription , a synergistic cooperativity is required between the NF-AT and the AP-1 sites .
The experiments presented herein , while not necessarily excluding cooperation between AP-1 and NF-AT in mediating the inhibitory effect of Dex , also suggest that the AP-1 motif ( but not the NF-AT ) of IL-2 promoter may be sufficient for inhibition by Dex .
Inability to demonstrate inhibition of the AP-1 noncatemer used by Vacca et al .
( 11 ) by Dex is due to its failure to be induced after stimulation .
A multimerized AP-1 construct derived from the AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter ( AP-CAT/NFIL2B2H ) , when used by Northrop et al .
( 12 ) , was inducible after stimulation .
Dex inhibited the activity of this construct by 78 % ( compared with 100 % inhibition of the intact IL-2 promoter ) .
Taken together , these results raise the intriguing possibility that , similar to activation of IL-2 promoter , where multiple transcriptional factors are required for optimal activity , maximal repression by GC may involve interaction with more than a single factor and/or binding site .
Recent work in murine cells has suggested that AP-1 is important for binding and activity of NF-AT and has also suggested a close physical and functional interaction between these two factors ( 36 ) .
Our work raises the possibility that the primary target of GC in mediating inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity is transcriptional factor AP-1 , whereas its effect on NF-AT activity may be , at least in part , indirect , through decreasing AP-1 activity .
A functional antagonism that involves direct protein to protein interactions between AP-1 and GR has been reported by several investigators ( 28-30 ) .
We have shown that the proximal AP-1 site of the human IL-2 promoter binds an inducible protein in primary human T lymphocytes , a protein that contains both c-jun and c- fos proteins and mediates repression by GC .
Vacca et al .
( 11 ) have also shown that the proximal AP-1 motif of the human IL-2 promoter binds an inducible complex containing c- fos protein in Jurkat cells .
Our results differ from those recently reported by Northrop et al .
( 12 ) , who suggest that inhibition of IL-2 transcription by GC is mediated by direct interaction between GR and a factor that binds to two sequences located in the proximal half of the IL-2 promoter ( NKIL2B/AP-1 and NFIL2A/OCT-1/OAP ) .
These sequences bind a similar , if not identical , inducible nuclear factor that has biological characteristics that distinguish it from AP-1 ( likely OAP ) ( 12 ) .
The discrepancy of these results may be due to differences in cell types used ( primary or transformed human vs. transformed human or murine ) or to differences in experimental protocols .
To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of GC inhibiting IL-2 transcription by interfering with nuclear factors Mechanism of Immunosuppression by Glucocorticoids __ 1487 for IL-2 promoter in primary human T lymphocytes .
Granelli-Piperno et al .
( 16 ) have also studied the effects of GC on the induction of nuclear factors binding in the IL-2 promoter in primary human T lymphocytes .
Dex at 10 ~ ' M , while blocking the increase in IL-2 mRNA in stimulated primary human T lymphocytes , did not inhibit binding of nuclear factors AP-1 , AP-3 , NF-kB , OCT-1 , and NF-AT .
We have previously shown that relatively high doses of Dex are required for inhibition of IL-2 gene transcription as determined by nuclear run-off assays ( minimum effective dose 10~° M ) , whereas lower concentrations ( 107° M ) are required for inhibition of IL-2 mRNA and protein product .
This discrepancy is due to posttranscriptional effects of GC on IL-2 gene expression ( 2 ) .
Thus , the difference between our results and those reported by Granelli-Piperno et al .
( 16 ) is due to lower doses of Dex used by these investigators ( 107° M vs. 107 '' M ) .
Concentrations of GC comparable to 10~° M of Dex used in these experiments are certainly achievable in vivo by doses of prednisone of > 1 mg/kg or methyl-prednisolone similar to those used for pulse therapy ( > 15 mg/ kg ) .
An infusion of 40 mg of cortisol ( equivalent to 10 mg of prednisone or 1.3 mg of Dex ) will result in plasma cortisol levels of ~ 1-4 X 10~° M ( 42 ) .
These facts are important to bear in mind when using data obtained in vitro to interpret the immunosuppressive effects of GC in vivo .
