11 CD14-Mediated Signal Pathway of Porphyromonas gingivalis Lipopolysaccharide in Human Gingival Fibroblasts ATSUSHI WATANABE , AKIRA TAKESHITA , SHIGEO KITANO , anp SHIGEMASA HANAZAWA* Department of Oral Microbiology , Meikai University School of Dentistry , Keyakidai 1-1 , Sakado City , Saitama 350-02 , Japan Received 25 March 1996/Returned for modification 17 May 1996/Accepted 7 August 1996 Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces expression of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes/macrophages via CD14 , one of the LPS receptors , which is expressed predominantly in these cells .
It has been demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS ( P-LPS ) also is able to induce inflammatory cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts .
Therefore , it is important to determine whether CD14 is expressed in gingival fibroblasts and to define the P-LPS-mediated signal-transducing mechanism in the cells .
In this study , we observed unexpectedly by immunohistochemical , Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) , and Northern ( RNA ) blotting assays that CD14 is expressed at high density in human gingival fibroblasts .
P-LPS-induced expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) gene in the cells was inhibited markedly by treatment with anti-human CD14 antibody and was completely was inhibited by herbimycin A , a potent inhibitor of tyrosine kinase .
The inhibitor also dramatically inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity of and MCP-1 production by the cells .
Furthermore , P-LPS-induced expression of the MCP gene in the cells also was blocked by inhibitors of two transcription factors , i.e. , curcumin , an inhibitor of AP-1 , and pyrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor of NF-KB .
Both inhibitors inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity in the culture supernatant of P-LPS-treated cells .
Gel shift mobility assay showed stimulation of the AP-1 and NF-B contents in P-LPS-treated cells .
This study is the first to demonstrate the expression of CD14 in human gingival fibroblasts and to show that the signal-trans- ducing pathway of P-LPS in the cells is mediated by CD14 .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) of Porphyromonas gingivalis , a pathogenic bacterium of periodontal disease , has been considered an important pathogenic component of the organism in the initiation and development of periodontal diseases , because bacterial LPS is known to be a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokine production and bone resorption ( 2 , 12 , 18 , 21 , 31 ) .
One target of LPS is the human gingival fibroblast , a cell that play an important role in the remodeling of periodontal soft tissues .
These fibroblasts may also function as a regulator of the cytokine network of periodontal tissues , because they produce several kinds of cytokine when stimulated by inflammatory cytokines and bacterial cell components .
Several studies ( 18 , 33 , 35 ) have shown that P. gingivalis LPS ( P-LPS ) stimulates interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-8 , and IL-6 production by human gingival fibroblasts .
Other studies ( 37 , 42 ) have demonstrated that CD14 , one of the LPS receptors , plays an important role in signal transduction in the LPS-responsive cells .
It is well known that a high expression of CD14 is found predominantly on monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils .
However , more recently , an interesting study ( 10 ) has demonstrated that CD14 gene expression in the mouse is not restricted to myeloid cells but also occurs in epithelial cells of various organs .
This demonstration suggested to us that LPS may be involved actively in inflammatory reactions of various tissues via CD14 .
Therefore , it is important to examine whether human gingival fibroblasts express CD14 on their cell sur-face .
If they do , it would be of interest to elucidate the CD14-mediated signal transducing mechanism of P-LPS in these gingival fibroblasts .
In this study , we show that human gingival fibroblasts ex * Corresponding author .

Acetone-fixed cells were incubated in the presence of normal mouse IgG ( A ) or anti-human CD14 antibody ( B ) and then reacted with horseradish-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody .
In another experiment ( C ) , total RNA was prepared from gingival fibroblasts incubated under serum-free conditions , and Northern blotting analysis was performed with mouse CD14 and B-actin cDNAs used as probes .
In addition , Western blotting analysis using anti-human CD14 antibody ( lane 1 ) and normal mouse IgG as a control antibody ( lane 2 ) was conducted to test for the presence of CD14 in the cells ( D ) .
An identical Western blot experiment independently performed gave similar results .

Blots were blocked with 2 % skim milk in Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ) ( 100 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 150 mM NaCl ) containing 0.05 % Tween 20 for 6 h and washed with 0.1 % Tween 20 in TBS .
Then the membrane was incubated for 12 h at room temperature with anti-human CD14 antibody ( 1:100 ) or normal mouse IgG ( 1:100 ) in TBS and washed twice with 0.1 % Tween 20 in TBS .
The washed membrane was treated for 3 h at room temperature with 2 Ci of ***I-labeled protein A per ml and 0.1 % Tween 20 in TBS and then exposed to X-Omat film ( Eastman Kodak Co. ) .
Immunohistochemistry .
Immunostaining was performed on acetone-fixed smears of human gingival fibroblasts .
The fixed smears were treated for 10 min with 10 % normal rabbit serum , washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( pH 7.2 ) , incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibody ( 1:100 ) or normal mouse IgG ( 1:100 ) as a control antibody , and washed ; thereafter the immunohistological reaction was detected with a kit of avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse IgG as instructed by the manufacturer .
cDNA hybridization probe .
Plasmids containing human MCP-1 sequences ( a gift from B. J. Rollins ) , mouse CD14 sequence ( a gift from S. Yamamoto ) , and B-actin sequences ( Oncor Co. , Gaithersburg , Md . )

Preparation of total RNA and Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis .
The cells were cultured in « -MEM with 10 % FCS in Falcon 90-mm-diameter plastic plates until nearly confluent .
The cells were washed , incubated for 24 h in serum-free -MEM , and subsequently treated for the desired periods in serum-free e-MEM with or without test samples at various concentrations .
Total cellular RNA in the cells was extracted by the guanidine isothiocyanate procedure ( 6 ) .
Gene expression was analyzed by Northern blot assay as described previously ( 19 ) .
B-Actin was used as an internal standard for quantification of total mRNA on each lane of the gel .
Monocyte chemotactic assay .
The monocyte chemotactic assay was performed as described previously ( 9 ) .
Briefly , human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia Japan ) and used for the chemotaxis assay in a 48-well apparatus equipped with a 5-m-pore-size polycarbonate filter ( Nuclepore ; Costar Corp. , Cambridge , Mass . ) .
Monocytes that had migrated through the filter onto its bottom side were counted in 20 microgrid fields under oil immersion ( magnification , 1,000 ) , and then the total count was divided by 20 .
The chemotactic activity was expressed as the mean + standard deviation of the total number of migrating monocytes per oil immersion field in triplicate assays .
Formyl-methionyl-leucine-phenylalanine at 10~® M was used as a positive control .
Metabolic labeling and i precipitation assay .
Subconfluent monolayers of the cells were washed , treated or not with test samples , and then incubated for 24 h in methionine-free Eagle 's MEM containing ( 350 pCi/ml ) .
The culture supernatants ( 500 pl ) were supplemented with Triton X 100 ( 1 % ) , EDTA ( 1 mM ) , and protease inhibitors ( PMSF [ 0.8 mM ] and leupeptin [ 10 ug/tml ] ) .
Each sample was centrifuged to remove any cellular debris , aliquoted , and incubated overnight at 4°C with normal rabbit serum as the control serum or anti-MCP-1 antiserum ( 1:100 ) .
Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads ( 30 pl ) , washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.4 ] , 300 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 % bovine serum albumin , 10 mM Nal ) plus protease inhibitors , washed with distilled water , and then eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer ( 2 % SDS , 6 % 2-mercaptoethanol , 0.06 M Tris-HCl [ pH 6.8 ] , 10 % glycerol ) .
The eluted proteins were boiled for 3 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on 17.5 % polyacrylamide gels .
The gels were treated with Amplify ( Amersham Japan ) for 20 min , dried , and exposed to Kodak XAR film ( Eastman Kodak ) at -70°C for 2 days .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Confluent monolayers in 15-cm-diameter dishes were treated with test samples or not as indicated in the figure legends , their nuclei were isolated , and the extracts were prepared as described previously ( 19 ) .
Briefly , the nuclei were treated with buffer A ( 10 mM N-2-hydroxyeth-ylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ; pH 7.9 ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KCI , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] ) and further treated by being stirred for 60 min at 4°C in buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.42 M NaCl , 25 % glycerol , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) .
Nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation for 60 min at 25,000 x g and desalted by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 0.1 M KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) .
Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford ( 3 ) .
Gel mobility shift assay .
The assay was carried out as described previously ( 20 ) .
Briefly , binding reactions were performed with 5 ug of sample protein in a mixture of 2 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 8 mM NaCl , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.8 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , 0.2 mM DTT , and 20,000 cpm of a *°P-labeled AP-1 or NF- « B oligonucleotide in a final volume of 20 pl for 20 min on ice .
The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a tandem repeat of the consensus sequence for the binding site for AP-1 , -TGACTCA- , and that for NF- « B , -GGGGACTITCC- , was end labeled by the T4 polynucleotide kinase- [ y- '' '' PJATP method .
Each unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was used as a competitor .
DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on native 5 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 X TBE buffer ( 22 mM Tris [ pH 8.0 ] , 22 mM boric acid , 0.6 mM EDTA ) .
Gels were vacuumed , dried , and exposed to Kodak X-ray film at -70°C .
RESULTS CD14 expression in human gingival fibroblasts .
Since several studies ( 18 , 33 , 35 ) have shown that human gingival fibroblasts are P-LPS responders , first we examined , using anti-human CD14 antibody , whether the fibroblasts express CD14 .
Interestingly , as seen in Fig .
1B , CD14 was clearly detected in 4490 WATANABE ET AL .

the cells .
This immunohistochemical observation suggests the possibility the CD14 gene is expressed in the cells .
Therefore , we examined by the Northern blotting assay the expression of the CD14 gene in gingival fibroblasts .
As shown in Fig .
1C , expression of the CD14 gene was observed in the cells .
This CD14 expression was not augmented by P-LPS treatment ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , we looked for the presence of CD14 in the cells by carrying out a Western blotting assay .
As shown in Fig .
1D , the presence in the cells of CD14 with a molecular mass of 54 kDa was confirmed .
These results suggested the possibility that P-LPS-mediated responses in human gingival fibroblasts is via CD14 .
Involvement of CD14 in MCP-1 gene expression in P-LPS-treated human gingival fibroblasts .
Next , we examined , using anti-human CD14 antibody , whether the LPS induces MCP-1 gene expression via CD14 .
As shown in Fig .
2 , P-LPS-induced expression of the MCP-1 gene in the cells was markedly inhibited by treatment with CD14 antibody .
We also observed that P-LPS-induced MCP-1 gene expression was increased even more in the presence of 2 % human serum ( data not shown ) .
On the other hand , as shown in Fig .
3 , although £ .
coli LPS was not able to induce MCP-1 gene expression under culture conditions without serum , gene expression was clearly induced by this LPS in the presence of 2 % serum .
These results strongly indicated the involvement of CD14 in P-LPS-induced expression of the MCP-1 gene of human gingival fibroblasts .
Therefore , using these cells as an experimental system for MCP-1 gene expression , we analyzed how the LPS-CD14 interaction leads to signal transduction in gingival fibroblasts .
Effect of protein kinase inhibitor on expression of the MCP-1 gene in P-LPS-treated human gingival fibroblasts .
At first , we examined the effects of H-7 and staurosporine , both of which have a relatively high specificity for protein kinase C , on MCP-1 gene expression in P-LPS-treated cells .
The cells were treated with one of the inhibitors before stimulation with P-LPS , and then MCP-1 gene expression was analyzed by Northern blotting assay .
As shown in Fig .
4A and B , MCP-1 gene expression induced by P-LPS was not strongly affected by staurosporine at 10 nM or by H-7 at 10 M. We also examined the effect of herbimycin A , an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase , on expression of the MCP gene under the experimental conditions described above .
As shown in Fig .
4C , the inhibitor inhibited in a dose-dependent manner MCP -1 gene expression in InFECT .

the cells and inhibited it completely at 10 pg/ml .
The inhibitory effect was specific , because B-actin gene expression , an internal control , was unaffected by the inhibitor .
Furthermore , the effect of H-89 , an inhibitor with a relatively high specificity for protein kinase A , on MCP-1 gene expression was examined .
H-89 at 25 M barely inhibited MCP-1 gene expression ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that tyrosine kinase may play a major role in P-LPS-induced MCP-1 gene expression in human gingival fibroblasts .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibits MCP-1 production by P-LPS-treated human gingival fibroblasts .
We next examined the effect of herbimycin A on monocyte chemotactic activity in the culture supernatant of , and on production of MCP-1 by , P-LPS-treated cells .
Figure 5A shows that herbimycin A inhibited the chemotactic activity in a dose-dependent fashion .
Furthermore , we observed by immunoprecipitation assay that the inhibitor also blocked MCP-1 production by P-LPS-treated gingival fibroblasts ( Fig .
5B ) .
These results strongly suggest the involvement of tyrosine kinase in the CD14-mediated LPS signal transduction for MCP-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts .
Involvement of transcriptional factors NF-KB and AP-1 in expression of the MCP-1 gene in P-LPS-treated human gingival fibroblasts .
We also examined , using potent inhibitors of transcriptional factors ( PDTC for NF-kB and curcumin for AP-1 ) , whether either or both factors function in the transcription of MCP-1 gene expression in P-LPS-treated cells .
As shown by Northern blotting analysis ( Fig .
6 ) , both inhibitors dose dependently blocked expression of the MCP-1 gene in the cells .
These results suggest that NF- « B and AP-1 may be involved in transcriptional regulation of the P-LPS-induced MCP-1 gene .
PDTC and curcumin also inhibit the monocyte chemotactic activity of P-LPS-treated human gingival fibroblasts .
Since MCP-1 gene expression of P-LPS-treated gingival fibroblasts was markedly inhibited by PDTC and curcumin , we also examined whether both inhibitors are able to inhibit monocyte chemotactic activity in culture supernatants of P-LPS-treated cells .
Figure 7 shows that the chemotactic activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both inhibitors .

tions of both inhibitors on MCP-1 production by the P-LPS-treated cells .
P-LPS stimulates the production of NF-KB and AP-1 in human gingival fibroblasts .
Finally , it is important to prove whether P-LPS actually stimulates an increase in NF-kB and AP-1 contents in human gingival fibroblasts .
Therefore , we examined the effect of P-LPS on NF- « B and AP-1 contents in human gingival fibroblasts by conducting a gel mobility shift assay .
As shown in Fig .
8 , P-LPS markedly stimulated the binding of nuclear proteins to the consensus sequences of the binding sites for AP-1 and NF- « B .
Since the stimulated binding in each case was completely inhibited by each competitor , i.e. , the unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the respective consensus sequence , these results suggest that P-LPS is able to stimulate an increase in amount of AP-1 and NF-kB in human gingival fibroblasts .
DISCUSSION This study is the first to demonstrate that human gingival fibroblasts express CD14 and that P-LPS induces expression of MCP-1 in the cells via CD14 .
Our immunohistochemical studies unexpectedly showed a high level of expression of CD14 in human gingival fibroblasts .
This observation was strengthened by the results of the Northern and Western blotting assays showing that the CD14 gene also is expressed in the cells .
These observations suggested to us that P-LPS may induce expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 , IL-8 , and MCP-1 in the cells via CD14 .
Therefore , we examined , using anti-human CD14 antibody , whether the P-LPS-induced MCP-1 expression in the cells is mediated via CD14 .
The P-LPS induction was dramatically inhibited by the antibody treatment .
This inhibitory effect proved the involvement of CD14 in P-LPS induction of an inflammatory cytokine in the cells .
As shown in previous studies ( 15 , 33 , 35 ) , P-LPS is able to induce expression of inflammatory cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts under serum-free culture conditions , although £ .
coli LPS did not have such an effect under these same conditions .
The reason for this difference has not been examined in detail .
Many studies ( 4 , 11 , 29 , 40 ) have suggested the importance of LPS-binding protein ( LBP ) in serum for the LPS response in macrophages and endothelial cells , because the LPS response is stimulated markedly when serum is present in the medium .
An interesting study ( 14 ) has demonstrated that LBP is an accelerator protein for LPS binding to CD14 .
Interestingly , we observed that E. coli LPS is able to induce expression of the IL-6 gene in human gingival fibroblasts when 2 % serum is present in the B A 100 200 % 80 97.4— > § € 69 -* » 1 § so 46 - » ] 1 , Fk | 3 6 30 - » ** ; I < 3 40 § S 21.5 - » = 3 20 smug * 14.3 _ a- MCP P-LPS _ - 0 4+ 40 40 4+ = i Herbimycin A - 0.1 10 10 10 P-LPS -- + + + + ( ug/ml ) Herbimycin A - - - - ++ Control serum - + - + - + anti-MCP- !

medium ( unpublished data ) , though the LPS is unable to induce the expression of its cytokine under serum-free conditions as described above .
These observations suggest that E. coli LPS may require LBP in order to bind to CD14 to induce expression of cytokines of human gingival fibroblasts .
In further experiments , it will be important to elucidate this point .
We ( 18 ) previously showed that monocyte chemotactic activity in the cervical fluid of adult periodontal patients increases with the severity of the disease and that the MCP-1 gene is expressed to a high level in gingival tissues of patients with advanced disease , although it was not detected in the tissues of healthy subjects .
Several investigators ( 18 , 41 ) have also demonstrated that MCP -1 gene expression is detectable in inflamed gingiva of adult periodontal patients .
These observations suggested an important role for MCP-1 in monocyte recruitment to gingival tissues in this disease .
Therefore , it is important to understand the LPS signal-transducing pathway in human gingival fibroblasts .
Several studies ( 1 , 7 , 25 , 29 , 32 , 36 , 38 , 39 ) have demonstrated that the LPS signal-transducing pathway in monocytes/ macrophages works via CD14 .
As described above , since human gingival fibroblasts expressed CD14 , it is of interest to understand the CD14-mediated signal transducing pathway , A 100 - 80 3 5 60 5 5 ao éz ; 20 *~ 3 0 P-LPS _- + + + + Curcumin ( uM ) - - 1 5 10 10 InFECT .

because such a pathway has not yet been demonstrated in these cells .
Many kinds of protein kinase play a significant role in signal transduction induced by LPS , cytokines , and growth factors .
We observed that herbimycin A , a potent inhibitor of tyrosine kinase , dramatically inhibited expression of the LPS-induced MCP-1 gene in human gingival fibroblasts .
The inhibitor also potently inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity and MCP-1 production in culture supernatants of P-LPS-treated cells .
Recent studies ( 1 , 5 , 7 , 17 , 25 , 30 , 32 , 36 , 38 , 39 ) also have shown that LPS induces tyrosine phosphorylation in monocytic cells via CD14 .
Together with these demonstrations , our study suggests that tyrosine kinase may play a significant role in signal transduction in LPS-responsive fibroblasts .
LPS activation of tyrosine kinase may lead to formation of some tyrosine-phosphorylated protein ( s ) as a second messenger .
We do not know which tyrosine-phosphorylated protein ( s ) is induced by P-LPS .
However , since such a protein ( s ) may be involved in induction of transcriptional factors that regulate P-LPS-induced responses in human gingival fibroblasts , it is of interest to identify this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein ( s ) .
On the other hand , although recent studies ( 16 , 26 ) have demonstrated the importance of mitogen-activated protein kinase in LPS-treated monocytic cells , we do not know whether mitogen-activated protein kinase is involved in P-LPS-treated human gingival fibroblasts .
Our next interest was to demonstrate which transcriptional factor is involved in P-LPS-induced MCP expression in human gingival fibroblasts .
We used two inhibitors , curcumin and PDTC , to examine this point .
Earlier studies ( 20 , 22 , 23 , 34 ) demonstrated that curcumin inhibits AP-1 binding to the consensus sequence by suppressing specifically the c-jun gene .
However , it is known that the inhibitor is also able to inhibit NF-kB activity .
On the other hand , PDTC inhibits NF- « B activation by suppressing the release of the inhibitory subunit IxB from the latent form of NF-kB ( 28 ) .
We observed in this study that both inhibitors strongly blocked expression of the P-LPS-induced MCP -1 gene in human gingival fibroblasts .
The P-LPS-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in culture supernatants of the cells also was drastically inhibited by both inhibitors .
These observations suggest to us that AP-1 and NF- « B may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of P-LPS-induced MCP-1 expression .
Therefore , using the gel mobility shift assay , we examined whether AP-1 and NF- « B factors are induced in the gingival fibroblasts by P-LPS .

After 1 h , P-LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
was added ; cell culture supernatants were collected after 24 h. Monocyte chemotactic activity in each supernatant was measured .
The results are expressed as mean + standard deviation from triplicate cultures .

P-LPS induces AP-1 and NF-kB in human gingival fibroblasts .
The cells were treated or not with P-LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) , and after 6 h , the nuclear proteins were prepared .
Gel mobility shift assay was performed with `` P-labeled oligonucleotide or it plus , as the competitor , unlabeled oligonucleotide ( 10 ng ) containing the AP-1 ( A ) or NF-xB ( B ) consensus sequence in the presence of the nuclear proteins .
An identical experiment independently performed gave similar results .
mobility shift assay showed a marked increase in AP-1 and NF-xB contents elicited by the P-LPS .
Since this increase was blocked completely by each competitor , an unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the AP-1 or NF-kB consensus sequence , the P-LPS-induced AP-1 and NF- « B increase is spe-cific .
Recently , negative and positive regulation among transcriptional factors have been proposed by many investigators .
Therefore , in the near future , it is important to demonstrate the type of regulation effected by transcriptional factors involved in P-LPS-induced gene expression in human gingival fibroblasts .
In conclusion , P-LPS induces activation of tyrosine kinase in human gingival fibroblasts via CD14 , which leads to MCP-1 gene expression through transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-xB .
