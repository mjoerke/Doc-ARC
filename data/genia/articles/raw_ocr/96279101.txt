Octamer Binding Factors and Their Coactivator Can Activate the Murine PU.1 ( spit-1 ) Promoter* ( Received for publication , November 7 , 1995 , and in revised form , February 21 , 1996 ) Hui-min Chen } , Pu Zhang , Hanna S. Radomska , Christopher J. Hetherington , Dong-Er Zhang , and Daniel G.

Our previous studies ( Chen , H. M. , Ray-Gallet , D. , Zhang , P. , Hetherington , C. J. , Gonzalez , D. A. , Zhang , D.-E. , Moreau-Gachelin , F. , and Tenen , D. G. ( 1995 ) Oncogene 11 , 1549-1560 ) demonstrate that the PU.1 promoter directs cell type-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines , and that PU.1 activates its own promoter in an autoregulatory loop .
Here we show that the murine PU.1 promoter is also specifically and highly functional in B cell lines as well .
Oct-1 and Oct-2 can bind specifically to a site at base pair -55 in vitro , and this site is specifically protected in B cells in vivo .
We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in B cells ; an Spl binding site adjacent to the octamer site , and the PU.1 autoregulatory site .
Finally , we show that the B cell coactivator OBF-1/Bobl/OCA-B is only expressed in B cells and not in myeloid cells , and that OBF-1/Bob1/0CA-B can transactivate the PU.1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells .
This B cell restricted coactivator may be responsible for the B cell specific expression of PU.1 mediated by the octamer site .
PU.1 is the product of the spi-1 oncogene identified as a consequence of its transcriptional activation in Friend virus induced erythroleukemias ( 1-4 ) .
The overexpression of the PU.1 gene from a retroviral construct in long term bone marrow cultures is able to provoke the proliferation of proerythro-blast-like cells that differentiate at a low frequency into hemo-globinized cells ( 5 ) .
PU.1 antisense oligonucleotides reduce the capacity of Friend tumor cells to proliferate , and competitor oligonucleotides block myeloid colony formation in human CD34* cells ( 6 , 7 ) .
Moreover , disruption of the PU.1 gene by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells is lethal for homozygous PU .

Embryos present with multilineage defects in white cell development , including B cells .
Taken together , these data demonstrate the importance of proper regulation of PU.1 in the hematopoietic system in general , and particularly in B cells .

vators and is involved in the regulation of expression of multiple genes specific for different lineages .
PU.1 has been shown to bind to the promoters of many myeloid genes and is critical for their myeloid specific expression ( listed in Ref .
9 and reviewed in Ref .
10 ) .
In B cells , PU.1 regulates the J chain promoter and immunoglobulin promoters , the immunoglobulin A 2-4 and k 3'-enhancers , the u heavy chain gene enhancer , the B29 gene promoter , and Epstein-Barr viral promoters ( 11-18 ) .
Since PU.1 is such an important transcription factor in hematopoietic development , and abnormalities of PU.1 expression can lead to experimental erythroleukemia , we investigated the PU.1 promoter in order to understand its regulation .
Our previous investigation of the murine PU .
1 promoter in myeloid cells demonstrate that as little as 334 bp '' of upstream promoter sequence directs cell-type specific transcription .
This promoter includes a binding site for PU.1 itself in this region , which may play an important role in positive autoregulation of PU.1 ( 9 ) .
As discussed above , in addition to myeloid cells , PU.1 is also strongly expressed in B lymphocytes and regulates many B cell-specific genes .
The functional region of the PU.1 promoter has octamer and Spl sites which are conserved in both the murine and human PU . ]
promoters ( 9 ) .
The octamer sequence ATGCAAAT was originally found in all immunoglobulin heavy and light chain promoters , as well as the intronic heavy chain enhancer ( reviewed in Refs .
19 and 20 ) .
Octamer binding proteins belong to the POU homeodomain transcription factor family ( 21 ) .
Two of the best characterized octamer binding proteins are Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
The Oct-1 protein is ubiquitously expressed , whereas Oct-2 is expressed mainly in B lymphocytes ( 22-27 ) .
Constitutively expressed Oct-2 can preserve expression of B cell-specific genes in cell hybrids ( 28 , 29 ) .
Oct-2 gene disruption shows that it plays an important role in B cell maturation at late stages , but not in early B cell development ( 30 ) .
In addition , several reports suggested the existence of octamer coactivators , proteins which augment the ability of octamer factors to stimulate promoters in a factor , promoter , and cell type-specific manner ( 31 , 32 ) .
Recently , both Oct-1 and Oct-2 have been shown to interact with a non-DNA binding octamer coactivator , known as Bob1 ( 83 ) , OBF-1 ( 34 ) , or OCA-B ( 35 ) , and that this interaction is critical for octamer function .
In these reports , the Oct-1/Oct-2 coactivator was reported to be expressed in B cells and not T cells , but its expression in myeloid cells was not extensively studied .
In this study , we show that the murine PU.1 promoter is highly functional in B lymphocytes and that an octamer site at bp -55 of the PU .
1 promoter is an important determinant of its B cell specificity and activity .
We also show that the octamer * The abbreviations used are : bp , base pair ( s ) ; CMV , cytomegalovirus ; hGH , human growth hormone ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; PCR , polymerase chain reaction .

Interaction between Oct-1/O0ct-2 and their coactivator may contribute significantly to the activity of the PU.1 promoter in B cell lines .

Plasmid Constructions-The murine 0.5-kb BamHI fragment containing the PU.1 promoter region from bp -334 to +147 was subcloned into the promoterless vector pXP2 just upstream of the luciferase reporter gene to generate mPU-334/luc ( 9 ) .
Unidirectional deletions of mPU-334/lue were prepared using exonuclease III as described ( 9 ) to create 5 ' deletions starting bp -197 , -86 , -61 , -48 , -39 , -7 , +34 , and +107 , to the end of bp +147 , to generate mPU-197/lue , mPU-86/lue , mPU-61/lue , mPU-48/luc , mPU-39/lue , mPU-7/ue , mPU+34/lue , and mPU+107/lue plasmids , respectively ( see Fig .

Transient Transfections-Electroporation was performed at 960 uF and 230 V for both BJA-B and Hela cells , and at 300 V for U937 cells .
Luciferase assays were performed following transient transfection of 20 ug of the promoter-luciferase constructs by electroporation as described elsewhere ( 43 ) .
Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting 1 ug of a plasmid containing the CMV promoter driving human growth hormone ( CMV-hGH ) , and measuring growth hormone levels in the supernatant .
Cells were harvested at 5 h. Data represent the mean and the standard error of the mean for three to four independent experiments , and all transfections were performed with at least three independent DNA preparations for each construct .
For cotransfection experiments , 10 ug of PU.1 promoter constructs and 2 pg of either the Oct-1 ( pCGOct-1 ) or Oct-2 ( pCGOct-2 ) expression vectors ( in which the octamer cDNAs are expressed by a CMV promoter ) ( 44 ) were transfected with or without 2 ug of the Bob1 ( octamer coactivator expression vector pCATH NLS-BOB1 , in which the Bobl cDNA is expressed by a CMV promoter ) ( 33 ) into Hela cells using the Ca , ( PO , ) , coprecipitation method ( 42 ) , or into U937 cells by electroporation ( 48 ) .
Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection for HeLa and 24 h for U937 cells .
Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting 0.2 pg of a plasmid containing the CMV-hGH , and measuring growth hormone levels in the supernatant .
Data represent the mean and the standard error of the mean for three independent experiments , and all transfections were performed with three independent DNA preparations for each construct .

In vivo footprinting bands were visualized using PU.1 Regulation by Octamer Factors and Coactivators the ligation-mediated-PCR procedure ( 42 , 46 ) .
The universal linker used in this amplification method is composed of two oligonucleotides , linker oligo 1 ( GAATTCAGATC ) and linker oligo 2 ( GCGGTGACCCGG-GAGATCTGAATTC ) .

Cell membranes were disrupted by pushing the cell suspension 5-10 times through a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe .
Nuclei were pelleted at top speed ( 12,000 rpm ) in a microcentrifuge for 20 s and resuspended in 0.67 volume of 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 25 % glycerol , 420 mM NaCl , 1.5 mm MgCl , , 0.2 mm EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride .
After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C , the extracts were centrifuged 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 x g , and the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen .
Binding reactions and gel retardation assays were performed as described previously ( 51 ) .

RESULTS The Murine PU.1 -334-bp Promoter Is Functional in B Cell Lines , and an Octamer Site at bp -55 Contributes to This Tissue Specificity-Our previous studies have shown that the murine 334-bp PU.1 promoter , as well as the human 290-bp promoter , demonstrate tissue-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines but not in T cells and Hela ( nonhemato-poietic ) cells ( 9 ) .
To determine if this region of the PU.1 promoter was functional in B cells , which also express high levels of PU.1 ( 8 , 50 ) , the -334 PU.1 promoter/luciferase construct was transfected into the B cell line BJA-B .
As shown in Fig .
1B , the murine PU.1I -334-bp promoter luciferase construct ( mPU.1-334/luc ) is highly active in BJA-B ells , with luciferase activities 47-fold higher than in Hela cells .
The activity in BJA-B is 5-fold higher than that in the myeloid cell line U937 ( Fig .
1B ) .
To locate the important regulatory region of the PU.1 promoter in B cells , a 5 deletion series of the -334 PU .
1 promoter was transfected into BJA-B cells .
As shown in Fig .
1B , in BJA-B cells , deletion from bp -334 to bp -61 did not significantly change promoter function , but deletion from bp -61 to -48 , which removes an octamer binding site , decreased activity to 20 % of the bp -334 promoter .
Deletion from bp -48 to -39 , which contains a Spl binding site , did not result in a significant change in luciferase activity .
Deletion from bp -7 to +34 , which removes a PU.1 binding site , decreased activity to 50 % of the bp -7 promoter .
Similar results were obtained with the murine B cell line K46 ( data not shown ) .
The Transcription Factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 Bind to the PU.1 Promoter at bp -55-The functional analysis of the PU.1 promotor deletion series suggested that the murine PU .
1 promoter -55 octamer site was important for its function in B cell lines .
To determine whether the octamer binding proteins bind the PU.1 promoter , we performed gel shift assays .
A 25-bp ( bp -66 to -42 ) oligonucleotide containing a central octamer site was used as a probe .
As shown in Fig .
24 , nuclear extracts from the Oct-1 or Oct-2 transiently transfected COS cells , which express undetectable levels of Oct-2 '' were used as sources of Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins for controls .

Binding was competed by self oligonucleotide ( Fig .

The complexes of Oct-1 and Oct-2 could be supershifted by anti-Oct-1 antibody or anti-Oct-2 antibody , respectively ( shown as SI or S2 in Fig .
24 , lanes 3 and 6 ) .
An Oct-1 complex was formed using nuclear extracts from U937 cells ( Fig .
2A , lane 7 ) .
The complex was specifically competed out by self oligonucleotide or by an oligonucleotide which has a wild type octamer site and mutant Sp1 site ( Fig .
24 , lanes 8 and 10 ) , but not by a mutated octamer site oligonucleotide from the PU.1 promoter , a wild type Spl site oligonucleotide from the PU .
1 promoter , or wild type PU.1 site oligonucleotide from the PU.1 promoter ( Fig .
24 , lanes 9 , 11 , and 12 ) .
Only anti-Oct-1 antibody could supershift the complex in U937 nuclear extracts , but not anti-Oct-2 antibody ( Fig .
24 , lanes 13 and 14 ) .
BJA-B nuclear extracts demonstrated a similar pattern of competition and supershifts for Oct-1 binding , and in addition an Oct-2 complex was observed which could be specifically competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides and supershifted by anti-Oct-2 antibody ( Fig .
2A , lanes 15-22 ) .
Nonim-mune antibody could not supershift the Oct-1 and Oct-2 complexes ( data not shown ) .
These results show that in the B cell line BJA-B , both Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to the PU.1 promoter octamer site , but in the myeloid cell line U937 only Oct-1 binding is observed .
The Transcription Factors PU.1 and Sp1 Bind to the PU.1 Promoter at bp +20 and -40 , Respectively , in B Cells-We have previously shown that in myeloid cells , PU.1 binds to a site in the 5'-untranslated region of the PU.1 promoter ( at bp +20 ) , and that this site is functionally important , leading to an autoregulatory loop in myeloid cells ( 9 ) .
Since PU.1 is also expressed at high levels in B cells , we asked whether PU.1 from B cell extracts also binds to this site .
As shown in Fig .
2B , PU.1 from the B cell line BJA-B binds to the PU.1 site to form a complex which comigrates with that formed by in vitro translated PU.1 , indicating that the complex does not contain other proteins , specifically NF-EMS5 , which can interact with PU.1 at sites found in B cell enhancers ( 12 ) .
This complex can be competed efficiently with wild type but not mutant PU.1 oligonucleotides , indicating a specific interaction .
Interestingly , al 15747 though this site is functionally important ( see below ) , PU.1 appears to bind with slightly lower affinity to this site compared to the CD11b PU .
1 promoter site ( Fig .

This was also observed when using nuclear extracts from myeloid cells ( 9 ) .
Most of the binding activity is supershifted with an antibody specific for PU.1 , which does not react with the related ets family member Spi-B ( 50 ) .
Therefore , although both PU.1 and Spi-B bind to this site ( 9 ) , and both are expressed in BJA-B cells ( 50 ) , it appears that most of the binding activity to this site in B cells represents PU.1 and not Spi-B .

The Octamer Site Is Protected in Vivo-Since in vitro DNA-protein binding experiments may not reflect binding occurring on promoters embedded in chromosomal structures in vivo ( 42 , 46 ) , in vivo footprinting analysis was performed to determine whether DNA-protein interactions occurred in a B cell specific matter .
Fig .

The human B cell line BJA-B repeatedly showed a protected region located at bp -51 , which lies in the center of the octamer binding sequence , ATGCAAAC ( 57 , 58 ) .
This protection was not observed in the myeloid cell line U937 .
One hypersensitive band is located at bp +21 , which is located just 3 ' of the PU.1 core site AGGAA ( 59 ) , and one protected band at bp +28 is noted in U937 cells ( lane 3 ) .
No obvious change was observed at the -40 region , which contains a Spl site .
The epithelial cell HeLa line showed neither protected nor hypersensitive bands ( Fig .

3 , lane 1 ) .
A weakly protected band was also observed at bp -76 in BJA-B and U937 cells .
We did not observe any protected or hypersensitive bands on the coding strand in BJA-B , U937 , or Hela cells ( data not shown ) .

In lane 1 , deproteinized genomic DNA ( N ) was used .

B cells .
In addition , deletion of a small region including this octamer binding site results in a large decrease of promotor function in B cell lines in transient transfection assays , suggesting that the octamer site is important for PU.1 promoter function in B cells .
In order to determine the effects of specific mutations in the context of the entire promoter , a 6-bp mutation in the octamer site was introduced into the PU.1 -334 promoter/luciferase construct .
This mutation abolished binding by both Oct-1 and Oct-2 as determined by gel shift competition experiments ( Fig .
24 ) .
In addition , in order to compare the relative contribution of the octamer , Sp1 , and PU.1 sites to B cell activity of the PU.1 promoter , similar mutations were introduced into the PU.1 and Spl sites .
In BJA-B nuclear extracts , Oct-1 and Oct-2 both specifically and strongly bind to the octamer site at bp -55 ( Fig .

In vitro synthesized PU.1 and Spi-B bind to the PU.1 site at bp +20 ( Fig .
2B ) , and purified Sp1 specifically binds to a site at bp -40 ( Fig .

We created specific mutations in each of these sites which abolished DNA binding of each factor , and these mutations were introduced singly or in combination into the -334 murine PU .

Mutation of the octamer site significantly reduces PU.1 promoter activity in B cells .
Specific mutations were introduced into the -334 to +147 murine promoter at the octamer site ( mutating bp -56 to -51 ) ; the Sp1 site ( bp -48 to -88 ) ; or the PU.1 ( bp +17 to +21 ) ; or both octamer and Sp1 sites as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Each mutation abolished specific binding at that site by octamer , Sp1 , or PU.1 , respectively ( Fig .

The left panel is a schematic representation of the wild type ( mPU-334 ) and mutant murine promoter constructs , as well as the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pXP2 .
The right panel shows the activity observed when 20 ug of these constructs were transfected into the BJA-B ( black bars ) and Helia ( white bars ) cell lines .
Transfection efficiency was corrected by cotransfecting 1 ug of CMV-hGH .

type PU.1 promoter , mutation of the octamer site led to a decrease in luciferase activity to 30 % of wild type in BJA-B cells .
The Spl mutation decreased activity to 64 % and PU.1 mutation to 36 % of wild type activity in BJA-B cells .
The construct harboring mutations in both the octamer and Spl sites yielded a loss of activity similar to that of the single octamer site mutation .
Similar results were observed in the murine B cell line K46 ( data not shown ) .
In the epithelial cell line Hela , none of the mutants caused a significant decrease of wild type luciferase activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast , in the myeloid cell line U937 , the PU.1 mutant , rather than the octamer mutant , led to the most dramatic decrease ( 9 ) .
Sp1 Can Transactivate the PU.1 Promoter-In gel shift experiments , Sp1 bound to a site at bp -40 of the PU .
1 promoter , and mutation of this site led to a 36 % decrease in luciferase activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
To demonstrate that Sp1 can transactivate the PU.1 promoter , we cotransfected PU.1 promoter constructs with a Sp1 expression vector ( pPac§p1 ) into Drosophila Schneider ( 82 ) cells , which , unlike most mammalian cells , lack endogenous Spl .
When the wild type mPU-334/luc construct was cotransfected with the pPac§p1 expression vector , luciferase activity increased 35-fold , compared to a 9-fold transactivation if the Sp1 site was mutated ( Fig .
5 ) .
These results indicate that Sp1 can bind to and activate the PU.1 promoter .
The lesser increase of activity using a construct with a mutation in the Sp1 binding site is frequently observed with other Sp1 dependent promoters ( 60 ) and may reflect transactivation mediated by undetectably weak binding of Spl to the mutant site ; by a mechanism which does not involve DNA binding , as has been observed with myb ( 61 ) ; or by binding of Sp1 to another location in the promoter .
In any case , these results show that most of the observed Sp1 transactivation is mediated through specific binding to the site at bp -40 .
Oct-2 Is Expressed at Low or Undetectable Levels in Myeloid Cells-In myeloid cells , PU .
1 itself is the most significant factor for PU.1 promoter function ( 9 ) , but the octamer site is most important in B cells ( Figs .
1B and 4 ) .
In order to understand this difference , we investigated the pattern of expression of factors interacting with the octamer site .
Oct-2 , unlike Oct-1 , is expressed primarily in B cells , but its expression pattern in myeloid cells has not been extensively described ( 22 , 57 ) .

The data represent the mean and standard error of three experiments .
critical in B cells , we used EMSA to determine Oct-2 expression in myeloid cell lines .
A 51-bp oligomer derived from the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ( 51 ) was used as a probe .
As shown in Fig .
6A , Oct-1 complexes are found at high levels in nuclear extracts of all cell lines tested ( Fig .
6A , lanes 2-17 ) .
Oct-2 complexes were present at high levels in BJA-B nuclear extracts only , with trace amounts in THP-1 , KG-1a , and M1 myeloid lines .
No Oct-2 complexes were observed in Mono Mac 6 or U937 myeloid lines , the T lymphoblastic line RPMI-8402 , or in HeLa cells ( Fig .
6A ) .
An anti-Oct-2 antibody reacted with the Oct-2 complexes but not the Oct-1 complexes ( Fig .
6A , lanes 3 , 7 , 15 , and 17 ) .
These results indicate that Oct-2 is expressed at trace or undetectable levels in myeloid cells .
The Octamer Coactivator Bob1/OBF-1/OCA-B Is Not Expressed in Myeloid Cells-In order to further determine the mechanism of why the octamer site was relatively more important for PU.1 promoter function in B cells versus myeloid cells , we examined the expression and function of the Oct-1/Oct-2 coactivator protein , Bob1l or OBF-1 .
This protein , which does not bind to DNA directly , has been shown to increase the ability of octamer proteins to activate octamer dependent promoters ( 33 , 34 ) .
The octamer coactivator has been reported to be expressed exclusively in cells of B cell origin , but not in non-B cells such as T cell lines or Hela cells ( 33 , 34 ) .
In order to determine whether the coactivator is expressed in myeloid cells , we performed Northern blot analysis using a human Bob1l cDNA probe .
As shown in Fig .
6B , the Bob1 probe hybridizes to a 3.2-kb mRNA species in human BJA-B cells and slightly smaller species in murine K46 , A20 , and Sp2 B cell lines , and not in Hela or Jurkat T cells , consistent with previously published results ( 33 , 34 ) .
We observed no hybridization to the multipotential line LyD9 , human promyelocytic/promonocytic lines U937 and HL-60 , the human monocytic line Mono Mac 6 , or to primary murine peritoneal macrophages , indicating that Bob1/OBF-1/0CA-B is not expressed in myeloid precursors or mature macrophages .
Octamer Coactivator Mediates Oct-1/Oct-2 Transactivation of the PU.1 Promoter-We next asked the question of whether the Oct-1/O0ct-2 coactivator could augment the ability of octamer proteins to activate the PU.1 promoter .
For these experiments , wild type mPU-334 and octamer mutant PU .
1 promoter luciferase constructs were transfected along with combinations of Oct-1 , Oct-2 , and Bob1l/OBF-1 expression constructs into HeLa cells , which contain significant endogenous levels of Oct-1 but not Oct-2 .

levels of both Oct-1 and Sp1 , two activators of PU.1 promoter activity .
Introduction of the Oct-1 expression vector did not augment wild type promoter activity , but addition of Oct-2 increased promoter activity 2.4-fold , as did transfection of Bobl alone , presumably through its augmentation of Oct-1 activity .
Cotransfection of both Oct-2 and Bob1l led to a dramatic increase in wild type activity , which was not observed in the presence of a mutation in the octamer site of the promoter ( Fig .
7A ) .
These results indicate that Bob1 can significantly stimulate PU.1 promoter activity , particularly in concert with Oct-2 .
Cotransfection of Oct-1 and Bobl did not increase promoter activity greater than that of Bob1l alone , perhaps due to the significant endogenous levels of Oct-1 in Hela cells .
Similar experiments were performed in the promonocytic U937 cell line , which expresses neither Oct-2 or Bob1 .
As shown in Fig .
7B , transient expression of the PU.1 promoter/luciferase construct with an expression vector for Oct-2 led to a 2.5-fold increase of PU-334 activity , higher than that observed with Oct-1 or Bob1 alone .
Cotransfection of Bob1 with either Oct-1 or Oct-2 expression vectors with the PU-334 construct showed a further increase of promoter function .
Cotransfection of Bob1l and Oct-2 increased the PU-334 promoter activity 5.7-fold , over twice the transactivation observed with Bob1 and Oct-1 .

1 promoter shows cell type specificity in myeloid cells which express PU.1 , but not in T cells nor in nonhematopoietic cells , and that in myeloid cells PU.1 autoregulates its own promoter by a positive feedback loop through a PU.1 DNA binding site at bp +20 of the 5'-untranslated region .
In this report , we studied PU.1 promoter function in B cells , and specifically how its regulation might differ from that observed in myeloid cells .
DNA binding and transfection analysis of deletions , mutations , in vivo footprint-ing , and cotransactivation analysis all indicate that the octamer binding site at bp -55 plays an important role in the expression of the PU.1 gene in B cells .
We considered how B cell-type specificity is mediated by the octamer site , since Oct-1 is expressed ubiquitously ( 22 ) .
One potential mechanism which could explain octamer mediation of B cell type specific regulation is that a special cofactor expressed only in B cells augments the function of Oct-1 or Oct-2 .
Our data support a model in which a B cell specific octamer coactivator augments the ability of octamer proteins to stimulate the PU.1 promoter , and this occurs specifically in B cells because the octamer coactivator Bob1/OBF-1/0CA-B is highly expressed in B cells and expressed at very low or undetectable levels in myeloid cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
In B cells , the octamer coactivator may augment the physical interaction between Oct-1 or Oct-2 and the TATAA binding protein , TBP ( 66 ) .
In myeloid cells , which express Oct-1 but very little or no Oct-2 ( Fig .
6A ) and no octamer coactivator , the TBP binding function mediated by Oct-1/0ct-2 and Bob1/OBF-1 in B cells may be substituted by binding of PU.1 , since PU.1 can also bind to TBP in vitro ( 67 , 68 ) .
Although many cells , including myeloid cells , express Oct-1 , Oct-2 is more restricted to B cells ( Fig .
6A ) .
We also showed that the octamer coactivator is expressed in B and not myeloid cell lines ( Fig .
6B ) .
In the case of the PU .
1 promoter , expression of Oct-2 alone increases activation of the PU.1 promoter in HeLa cells and U937 cells to a degree greater than that of Oct-1 , and this increase is augmented by the addition of the coactivator Bob1 ( Fig .
7 ) .
These results indicate that Oct-1 can by itself activate the PU .
1 promoter , but that this activation is weaker than that mediated by Oct-2 , whose effect is further augmented by B cell-specific expression of the octamer coactivator .
In contrast , we observed no decrease of luciferase activity when the PU .
1 promoter was transfected into Oct-2 knockout B cell lines ( 30 ) , compared to that observed in matched heterozy-gote ( Oct-2+/- ) lines ( data not shown ) .
These findings imply 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog PU.1 Regulation by Octamer Factors and Coactivators In B lymphocytes : In macrophages : ® & Note : GTF -general transcriptional factors Fic .

Model for the differential activation of the PU.1 promoter in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells .
We propose that , in B cells , the major activation of the general transcription factors ( GTF ) , including RNA polymerase II and associated general factors , is via the octamer site binding Oct-1 or Oct-2 , with postulated interactions of the octamer coactivator Bob1 ( identical to OBF-1 and OCA-B ) between octamer binding proteins and the GTF .
PU.1 and Sp1 may play lesser roles in activating the promoter .
In myeloid cells , due to lack of Oct-2 and Bob1 , the PU.1 site may play a more significant relative role .
Our data support a model whereby the effects of the octamer and PU.1 sites in the two different cell types are additive , so that the increased activity of the promoter in B cells can be attributed to presence of Oct-2 and Bob1 ( see Figs .
1B and 7B ) .
that B cell-specific expression of Oct-2 is by itself not essential for PU.1 promoter function and , depending on the cell type ; , Oct-1 and/or Oct-2 can support PU.1 expression .
The differences in the abilities of Oct-1 and/or Oct-2 to activate the PU .
1 promoter reflect differences in expression of octamer proteins , octamer coactivators , and other transcription factors ( Spl , PU.1 ) which interact on the PU.1 promoter regions .
In addition , differences in modifications of these proteins , such as phosphorylation of Oct-1 and Oct-2 during the cell cycle ( 44 , 69 ) , may also play an important role .
Our transactivation studies in Schneider cells implied that the Sp1 site at bp -40 of the PU .
1 promoter is involved in PU.1 regulation .
In vitro gel shift assays also demonstrated that Sp1 from nuclear extracts from BJA-B and U937 cells can specifically form a complex with an Sp1 site oligonucleotide from the PU.1 promoter .
Since the Sp1 and octamer sites are very close to one another in the PU.1 promoter , the octamer proteins binding at bp -55 may interact with Sp1 , which binds to an adjacent site at bp -40 .
This idea is supported by our data showing that if the octamer site has been deleted , further deletion of the Sp1 site does not lead to further loss of activity ( Fig .
1B , compare -48 to -39 deletion ) .
However , mutation of the Sp1 site in the presence of an intact octamer site ( Fig .
4 , Sp1 mut ) leads to a significant loss in promoter activity .
Cooperative interactions between Oct-1 and Spl have been described in other RNA polymerase II promoters ( 70 ) .
Cooperation between adjacent octamer and Spl sites could perhaps explain the functional importance of the octamer site in myeloid cells ( 9 ) , in which the octamer coactivator is not expressed .
15751 In the case of the PU.1 promoter , we were not able to observe a tertiary complex with Spl and Oct-1 , even when large amounts of recombinant proteins were added to the binding reaction ( data not shown ) .
PU.1 is also likely to be involved in activation of the PU.1 promoter in B cells .
Mutation of the PU.1 site in the PU.1 promoter reduced promoter activity to 36 % of wild type , close to the magnitude of that observed with mutations of the octamer site , but significantly less than that observed in myeloid cells .
We sought but did not find evidence of any physical interactions between PU.1 and either Oct-1 or Oct-2 in vitro ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , it has been previously shown that Oct-1 , Oct-2 , and Ets-1 itself can positively regulate the Ets-1 promoter ( 71 ) in a manner that is similar to that which we have now described for the regulation of the related family member PU.1 .
In summary , our studies have suggested an explanation of some of the mechanisms underlying the differences in activity of the PU .
1 promoter in myeloid versus B cells ( Table I and Fig .
8 ) .
In B cells , the presence of both Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the octamer coactivator Bob1/OBF-1/0CA-B may mediate activation of the promoter , presumably by interactions with general transcription factors .
Conversely , in myeloid cells , which express Oct-1 but either trace amounts or no Oct-2 and no Bobl ( Fig .
6 ) , the octamer site is not as significant for promoter activity as is the PU.1 site .
Overall , the PU .
1 promoter appears to be approximately 5 fold stronger in the B cell lines tested than in myeloid cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
Our transactivation studies suggest that this 5 fold difference might be largely accounted for by the action of Oct-2 and/or Bobl/OBF-1 ( Fig .
7 ) .
The actual role of the OBF-1/Bob1 coactivator in PU.1 expression in B cells may eventually be determined by investigating PU.1 expression in OBF-1/Bob1 `` knockout '' mice .
Finally , an important question not yet addressed by these and our previous studies ( 9 ) is how PU.1 is activated in early multiprogenitor cells ( 7 , 50 ) , and this shall be the focus of future studies of PU .
1 gene regulation .
