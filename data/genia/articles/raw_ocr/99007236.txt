Dervan , August 20 , 1998 ABSTRACT Sequence-specific DNA-binding small molecules that can permeate human cells potentially could regulate transcription of specific genes .
Multiple cellular DNA-binding transcription factors are required by HIV type 1 for RNA synthesis .
Two pyrrole-imidazole polyamides were designed to bind DNA sequences immediately adjacent to binding sites for the transcription factors Ets-1 , lymphoid-enhancer binding factor 1 , and TATA-box binding protein .
These synthetic ligands specifically inhibit DNA-binding of each transcription factor and HIV type 1 transcription in cell-free assays .
When used in combination , the polyamides inhibit virus replication by > 99 % in isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes , with no detectable cell toxicity .
The ability of small molecules to target predetermined DNA sequences located within RNA polymerase II promoters suggests a general approach for regulation of gene expression , as well as a mechanism for the inhibition of viral replication .
Simple rules have been developed to rationally control the sequence specificity of minor-groove binding polyamides containing pyrrole ( Py ) and imidazole ( Im ) amino acids ( 1-6 ) .
DNA recognition depends on a code of side-by-side aromatic amino acid pairings in the minor groove .
A pyrrole opposite an imidazole ( Py/Im pairing ) targets a C-G bp whereas Im/Py targets a G-C bp .
A Py/Py pair binds both AT and T-A pairs .
These compounds represent the only class of synthetic small molecules that can bind predetermined DNA sequences with affinities and specificities comparable to DNA-binding proteins ( 7 ) .
The DNA-binding activity of the 5S RNA gene-specific transcription factor TFIIIA was inhibited by an eight-ring hairpin polyamide that bound within the recognition site of zinc finger four in the DNA minor groove .
As a result , transcription of 5S RNA genes by RNA polymerase III was suppressed in vitro and in cultured Xenopus cells ( 8 ) .
The question arises whether polyamides can permeate human cells and specifically regulate genes transcribed by pol II ( RNA polymerase II ) .
As a first case study , we examined the ability of polyamides to inhibit HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription in cell-free assays and viral replication in human lymphocytes .
The HIV-1 enhancer/promoter element contains binding sites for the cell-encoded proteins upstream stimulatory factor , Ets-1 , lymphoid-enhancer binding factor 1 ( LEF-1 ) the nuclear factors NF- « B , Sp1 , and TATA-box binding protein ( TBP ) ( Fig .
14 ) ( 9 ) .
To shut-down the promoter , polyamides were designed to target the transcription factors TBP , LEF-1 , and Ets-1 simultaneously .
TBP is indispensable for initiation of HIV-1 transcription , and LEF-1 , considered to be an architectural protein , plays a central role in coordinating activities The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .

12890 of multiple transcription factors ( 10 ) .
Both TBP and LEF-1 bind the minor groove of DNA and are likely to be inhibited by the minor groove binding polyamides .
Ets-1 predominantly contacts the major groove in the center of its binding site , with additional flanking contacts that are possibly in the minor groove ( 11 , 12 ) .
The DNA-recognition sites of these transcription factors are not optimal polyamide target sequences because they are found in the promoters of many cellular protein-coding genes .
However , the sequences immediately flanking these transcription factor binding sites often are conserved for a particular gene , providing an address for gene-specific targeting .
This study demonstrates how gene-specific polyamide inhibition can be achieved by targeting sequences that are located adjacent to , but do not coincide with , binding sites for transcriptional regulators and how strategic targeting of multiple transcription factors can result in effective inhibition of a pol II promoter and viral replication in human cells .
METHODS Polyamides .
Polyamides 1-4 were synthesized by solid phase methods as described ( 13 ) .
DNA-Binding Assays .
Recombinant human TBP ( Promega ) was used at 0.14 nM in gel mobility shift experiments with 100 ng of poly dG-poly dC per 10 pl of reaction as recommended .
A 50-bp kinase-labeled oligonucleotide , corresponding to positions -46 to +4 of the HIV-1 promoter ( 9 ) , was used at 1.5 nM final concentration .
The adenovirus major late promoter TATA region oligonucleotide had the top-strand sequence 5-GATCGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGG-3 ' and the complementary bottom-strand sequence .
Six percent nonde-naturing polyacrylamide gels containing 44 mM Tris-borate ( pH 8.3 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 4 mM MgCl » , and 0.02 % ( vol/vol ) Nonidet P-40 were used .
Recombinant LEF-1 protein containing the 86-aa DNA-binding domain was the generous gift of J .
Love ( Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) ( 14 ) .
DNA binding reactions , containing 8 nM LEF-1 , were performed in 10 mM Hepes-OH ( pH 7.5 ) , 100 mM KCI , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl » , 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , 250 ng of poly dG-poly dC , and 50 pmol of a singly end-labeled 400-bp restriction fragment isolated from pHIV long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase plasmid DNA ( obtained from K. A. Jones , Salk Institute , La Jolla , CA ) ( 15 ) .

mobility shift experiments ( 16 ) along with 50 pmol of a 43-bp HIV-1 oligonucleotide ( positions -160 to -117 ) .
In Vitro Transcription .
Transcription was monitored with a nuclear extract from HeLa cells ( Promega ) .
The human lymphoid cell line H9 ( ATCC HTB 176 ) was grown as described ( 17 ) , and whole-cell extracts were prepared by hypotonic lysis ( 18 ) .
Run-off RNA transcripts of ~300 bases [ cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) major immediate early promoter linked to a guanine-less cassette , pE1B-GL ( 19 ) ] and ~500 bases ( pHIV long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol aceytyl transferase ) were obtained with EcoRI-digested plasmid DNA ( 100 ng per 25 ul reaction ) .
Polyamide-DNA complexes were allowed to form at ambient temperature for 15-30 min before addition of extracts .
Transcription reactions were carried out as described ( 17 ) .
The H9 cell extract was immunodepleted with antibody to LEF-1 ( provided by K. Jones ) prebound to protein A Sepharose beads as described ( 17 ) .
The efficiency of immunodepletion was determined by subjecting depleted and mock-depleted extracts to SDS/PAGE and Western blotting and was found to be > 95 % .
The blot was probed with LEF-1 antibody ( diluted 1:2500 ) and was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
Virus Replication .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were separated from whole blood collected from normal adult volunteers by density gradient centrifugation as described ( 20 , 21 ) .
Donors were provided by the General Clinical Research Center of The Scripps Research Institute , which is supported by National Institutes of Health Grant MO1 RRO0833 .
PBMC were activated with 2 ug/ml phytohemag-glutinin and 20 units/ml of interleukin 2 for 2-3 days before HIV-1 infection .
Each culture of 5 X 10° PBMC was infected with 10° tissue culture infectious doses of HIV-1 for 24 hours ; free virus was removed by washing the cells in medium , and polyamides were added to the culture .
Virus replication in culture was measured by HIV-1 p24 viral capsid antigen ELISA ( Dupont ) .
Assays of HIV-1 replication were performed five times with five human PBMC donors .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Polyamide Design .
The sequence 5'- ( ¥ , T ) GC ( A , T ) GC ( A , T ) -3 ' is present on both sides of the TATA box and immediately upstream of the Ets-1 binding site .
The sequence 5'-AGTACT-3 ' is found between the recognition sites for Ets-1 and LEF-1 ( Fig .
14 ) .
These sequences are conserved for most reported strains of HIV-1 ( 22 , 23 ) .
Although the propensity for mutation at these sites is unknown , allowed sequence changes in the promoter could be targeted with new polyamides designed by the pairing rules .
According to these rules , 5'- ( A , T ) GC ( A , T ) GC ( A , T ) -3 ' sequences may be targeted by hairpin polyamide 1 having sequence composition ImPy-B-ImPy-y-ImPy-B-ImPy-B-Dp ( Fig .
1B ) .
Because the B/B pairing recognizes both AT and T-A bp ( 24 ) , polyamide 1 is expected to bind to all three sites .
Quantitative footprint titration experiments revealed that polyamide 1 binds to each of these sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant ( Ky ) of 0.05 nM .
A mismatch control polyamide ImIm-B-ImIm-y-PyPy-B-PyPy-B-Dp ( 2 ) , which differs only in the placement of the Im and Py amino acids , binds the 5- ( A , T ) GC ( A , T ) GC ( A , T ) -3 ' sites with 100-fold reduced affinity relative to polyamide 1 .
According to the pairing rules , the sequence 5'-AGTACT-3 ' , between the LEF-1 and Ets-1 binding sites , will be bound by polyamide 3 of sequence composition ImPyPyPy-y-ImPyPyPy-B-Dp ( Fig .
1B ) ( 7 ) .
Quantitative footprint titration experiments revealed that polyamide 3 binds this site with K4 = 0.06 nM .
Mismatch polyamide 4 binds this sequence with > 100-fold reduced affinity .
Inhibition of TBP Binding .
Binding of the TBP subunit of TFIID in the minor groove nucleates assembly of the pol II transcription machinery for TATA-containing genes ( 25-27 ) .

Binding models and measured dissociation constants are shown .
Mismatches are highlighted .
TBP binds the HIV-1 TATA element with a Kq of ~1-3 nM .
A gel mobility shift assay revealed that polyamide 1 inhibits TBP binding to a double stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the HIV-1 TATA box region ( Fig .
24 , lanes 3-5 ) whereas no inhibition was observed for control polyamide 2 ( Fig .
24 , lanes 13-15 ) .
Additionally , polyamide 1 does not inhibit TBP binding to the TATA box region of the adenovirus major late promoter ( 5'-GGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGT-3 ' ) , which contains mismatch flanking sequences ( Fig .
24 , lanes 8-10 ) .
The half-life of the polyamide 1-DNA complex was determined by competition experiments to be in excess of 2.5 hours .
Inhibition of Ets-1 Binding .

Inhibition of transcription factor binding to the HIV-1 promoter and enhancer .
( 4 ) Gel mobility shift assay with TBP and polyamides 1 and 2 .
Oligonucleotides corresponding to the HIV-1 TATA box ( lanes 1-5 and 11-15 ) or adenovirus major late promoter TATA box ( lanes 6-10 ) were incubated with no polyamide ( lanes 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 11 , and 12 ) , 50 nM polyamide ( lanes 3 , 8 , and 13 ) , 100 nM polyamide ( lanes 4 , 9 , and 14 ) , and 200 nM polyamide ( lanes 5 , 10 , and 15 ) before the addition of recombinant human TBP , as indicated ( + ) .
The positions of free probes ( F ) and the monomer and dimer TBP-DNA complexes ( B ) are indicated .
( B ) Differential effect of polyamide 1 and 3 on Ets-1 DNA-binding .
Polyamide concentrations were 100 nM ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ) , 200 nM ( lanes 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 ) , and 400 nM ( lanes 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 ) .
( C ) DNase I footprint experiment with LEF-1 { Janes 7 to 14 ) and polyamide 3 used at the following concentrations : no polyamide ( lanes 1 and 7 ) , 10 pM ( lanes 2 and 8 ) , 30 pM ( lane 9 ) , 0.1 nM ( lanes 3 and 10 ) , 0.3 nM ( lane 11 ) , 1 nM ( lanes 4 and 12 ) , 3 nM ( lanes 5 and 13 ) , and 10 nM ( lanes 6 and 14 ) .
Polyamides and DNA were incubated before the addition of transcription factors .
ever , prevented the Ets-1/DNA complex formation ( Fig .
2B , lanes 9-11 ) .
The two mismatch polyamides 2 and 4 did not prevent complex formation ( lanes Fig .
2B , lanes 6-8 and 12-14 ) .
DNase I footprinting revealed that polyamide 1 prevents Ets-1 DNA-binding whereas polyamide 3 cooccupies the DNA with Ets-1 .
Polyamide 1 likely inhibits Ets-1 binding by steric interaction with protein contacts in the minor groove whereas polyamide 3 , which does not inhibit Ets-1 binding , must occupy the minor groove beyond the Ets-1 contacts .
Inhibition of LEF-1 Binding .
LEF-1 is a member of the high mobility group family of minor-groove binding proteins ( 14 ) and has been shown to be essential for HIV-1 transcription and Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 95 ( 1998 ) replication in lymphoid cells ( 28 ) .
Three sites on the HIV-1 promoter/enhancer restriction fragment are bound by the 86-aa LEF-1 DNA binding domain , sites L1 , L2 , and L3 ( Fig .
2C ) , with Kq = 1.4 , 5.8 , and 4.9 nM , respectively .
The LEF-1 footprint at site L1 , characterized by a marked DNase I hypersensitive site , changes to the polyamide footprint in the presence of match polyamide 3 ( Fig .
2C , lanes 8-14 ) .
LEF-1 binding is inhibited 50 % at a polyamide 3 concentration of ~60 pM .
Thus , polyamide 3 , located in the minor groove immediately adjacent to site L1 , inhibits LEF-1 binding to this site .
Polyamide 3 inhibits LEF-1 binding to the sites L2 and L3 at markedly higher polyamide concentrations ( 3 nM and above ; Fig .
2C , lanes 13-14 ) because there are no high affinity polyamide recognition sites adjacent to sites L2 and L3 .
Inhibition was observed either by adding the polyamide to the DNA before LEF-1 or after preincubation of the DNA with LEF-1 , consistent with the relative dissociation constants for the two binding reactions .
Mismatch polyamide 4 failed to inhibit LEF-1 binding .
Inhibition of Transcription .
The effects of polyamides 1 and 2 on HIV-1 transcription were tested in an in vitro transcription assay with a HeLa cell nuclear extract .
Polyamide 1 inhibited basal transcription from the HIV-1 promoter ( Fig .
34 , lanes 2-4 ) but not from the CMV major immediate early promoter , which contains a mismatched TATA-flanking sequence ( 5'-GAGGTCTATATAAGCAGA-3 ' ) ( Fig .
34 , lanes 6-8 ) .
The mismatch polyamide 2 did not inhibit transcription from either promoter ( Fig .
34 , lanes 10-12 and 14-16 ) .
We performed titrations of polyamide 1 over a wide range of concentrations ( 1 to 200 nM ) with both of the HIV-1 and CMV templates in the same reaction .
Under these conditions , we observed 50 % inhibition of HIV-1 transcription at 60 nM polyamide 1 , which corresponds to a 6- to 10-fold excess of polyamide over binding sites ( Fig .
3B , closed triangles ) .
No significant inhibition of CMV transcription was observed ( Fig .
3B , open circles ) .
To test the effects of polyamides 3 and 4 on LEF-1-activated HIV-1 transcription , we supplemented the HeLa nuclear extract with a human lymphoid H9 cell extract , which contains high levels of LEF-1 protein ( as determined by Western blot analysis ) .
The mixture of H9 and HeLa cell extracts stimulated HIV-1 transcription 2.5- to 3-fold over the level of transcription observed with the HeLa extract alone ( Fig .
3C , lane 1 ) .
Immunodepletion of LEF-1 protein from the H9 extract abolished this activated transcription ( Fig .
3C , compare lanes 1 and 6 ) .
Polyamide 3 inhibited HIV-1 transcription in this system ( Fig .
3C , lanes 2-5 ) with a 50 % reduction of transcription observed at 10-30 nM polyamide .
Polyamide 3 failed to inhibit HIV-1 transcription in the LEF-1-depleted extract ( Fig .
3C , lanes 7-10 ) .
We also monitored the activity of the CMV major immediate early promoter in both the mock-depleted and LEF-1-depleted H9 cell extract , with the result that LEF-1 depletion had no effect on CMV transcription .
As additional controls , we tested the effect of the mismatch polyamide 4 on HIV-1 transcription ( Fig .
3D , lanes 4 and 5 ) and polyamides 3 and 4 on CMV transcription ( Fig .
3D , lanes 6-10 ) .
No potential binding sites for either polyamide 3 or 4 are present in the CMV major immediate early promoter sequence .
As expected , polyamide 3 fails to inhibit CMV transcription ( Fig .
3D , lanes 7-8 ) , and polyamide 4 fails to inhibit either HIV-1 or CMV transcription ( Fig .
3D , lanes 4-5 and 9-10 ) .
Notably , polyamide 3 does not inhibit basal transcription , although binding sites for this polyamide are present at the start site for transcription and within the HIV-1 RNA coding sequence ( Fig .
2C ) .
These observations suggest that pol II can transcribe DNA with a polyamide bound in the minor groove and that polyamides are only inhibitory to transcription when these compounds interfere with the DNA binding activity of a required transcription factor .

Polyamide inhibition of HIV-1 transcription in vitro .
( 4 ) DNA templates containing the HIV-1 promoter ( lanes 1-4 and 9-12 ) and the CMV major immediate early promoter ( lanes 5-8 and 13-16 ) were incubated with the following concentrations of polyamide 1 or 2 ( as indicated ) before the addition of HeLa nuclear extract : no polyamide ( lanes 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 ) 50 nM polyamide ( lanes 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 ) , 100 nM { Janes 3 , 7 , 11 , 15 ) , and 200 nM ( lanes 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 ) .
( B ) Relative levels of HIV-1 transcription ( closed triangles ) compared with CMV transcription ( open circles ) are plotted as a function of polyamide 1 concentration , from mixed template reactions with HeLa nuclear extract .
( C ) Polyamide 3 inhibits LEF-1-activated transcription .
Transcription reactions were performed with HeLa nuclear extract supplemented with H9 whole cell extract ( lanes 1-5 ) or LEF-depleted H9 extract ( lanes 6-10 ) .
The final concentrations of polyamide were no polyamide ( lanes 1 and 6 ) , 10 nM ( lanes 2 and 7 ) , 30 nM ( lanes 3 and 8 ) , 100 nM ( Janes 4 and 9 ) , and 300 nM ( lanes 5 and 10 ) .
( D ) Transcription with mismatch control polyamide 4 and control CMV template .
Plasmid DNA was incubated with polyamide 3 ( 10 nM , lanes 2 and 7 ; 100 nM , lanes 3 and 8 ) or polyamide 4 ( 10 nM , lanes 4 and 9 ; 100 nM , lanes 5 and 10 ) .
turn-over kinetics ( 29 ) , we examined HIV-1 transcription indirectly by measuring the levels and kinetics of HIV-1 replication in human PBMC in culture .
PBMC were infected with the T cell-tropic HIV-1 strain WEAU1.6 ( 30 , 31 ) or with Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 95 ( 1998 ) - 12893 the macrophage-tropic strain SF162 ( 32 , 33 ) .
Polyamides were added to the culture medium , and the levels of HIV-1 p24 viral capsid protein released into the culture media ( primarily as virions ) were determined on subsequent days after infection by using a standard ELISA assay .
In control PBMC cultures with no added polyamide , viral replication of both strains resulted in increasing p24 levels between 4 and 10 days of culture ( Fig .
5 A and C ) .
Polyamide 1 at 1 wM concentration caused an 80 % reduction in virus whereas polyamide 3 at 1 wM concentration caused a 60 % reduction after 6 to 8 days ( Fig .
44 ) .
The combination of polyamides 1 + 3 inhibited HIV-1 replication at 10 nM to 1 wM concentration , but the closely related polyamides 2 + 4 did not ( Fig .
4B ) .
The combination of polyamides 1 and 3 at 1 uM each acted in synergy to reduce viral p24 levels to below the threshold of detection after 6-8 days for WEAU ( < 10 pg/ml ; > 99.9 % inhibition of viral replication ) ( Figs .
44 and 5C ) and were as effective as 1 uM azidothymidine in blocking HIV-1 replication .
The macrophage-tropic SF162 isolate , which replicates in both macrophages and CD4* T-lymphocytes , was not inhibited efficiently by either polyamide alone , but the combination of 1 mM each polyamide 1 and 3 reduced and eventually blocked its replication after 10 days ( Fig .
54 ) .
Addition of mismatch polyamides 2 and 4 , which differ by a single atomic substitution ( 4 ) , or a rearrangement of the Im and Py amino acids ( 2 ) , from the match polyamides , had no effect on the level of virus in the medium , either alone or in combination ( Fig .
4B ) .
The inhibitory effects of polyamides was not caused by obvious toxicity .
No significant decrease in cell viability was apparent in PBMC cultures treated with polyamides 1 and 3 for 10 days , in contrast to 90 % mortality observed for PBMC cells treated with 1 wM azidothymidine for the same period ( Fig .
5 B and D ) .
Cell viability was slightly higher in WEAU-infected cultures that were treated with polyamides 1 and 3 than in untreated cultures ( Fig .
5D , filled circles versus open circles ) , probably because the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 infection was reversed completely .
Cell recovery was not impacted by polyamide treatment but was reduced by azidothymidine treat-ment .
The observed polyamide inhibition of virus replication is likely caused by interference with the DNA-binding activities of TBP and Ets-1 by polyamide 1 and the binding activity of LEF-1 by polyamide 3 , but it is possible that inhibition of A B 2500 250 2000 - 200 { 1500 -| L 150 HIV p24 ( pg/m ! )

Kinetics of polyamide inhibition of HIV-1 replication and effects on cell viability .
PBMC were infected with the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolate SF162 ( 4 and B ) or the T-cell tropic isolate WEAU 1.6 ( C and D ) .
Polyamides 1 and 3 were added in combination at 1 uM each .
Virus replication was monitored by p24 ELISA ( 4 and C ) .
Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion in the presence of polyamides or azidothymidine ( B and D ) .
cellular genes involved in T-cell activation could have an indirect effect on HIV-1 replication .
To assess this possibility , we performed an RNase protection assay for transcripts of a number of cytokine and growth factor genes , including interleukin 2 , interleukin 5 , and interleukin 13 , which differ in the target sequences flanking the TATA box .
Four other cytokine genes that lack binding sites for either polyamide 1 or 3 in their promoters also were examined ( Fig .
6 ) .
The results show that exposure of activated human PBMC to a combination of either polyamides 1 + 3 or 2 + 4 ( 1 wM each ) for 6 days failed to inhibit RNA expression of all of the genes examined ( Fig .
6 ) .
There was no difference in the intensity of CD4 and CD8 RNA bands ( data not shown ) , indicating equivalent recovery of CD4 and CD8 T cells in treated and untreated cells .
This lack of inhibition of cytokine gene transcription suggests that the polyamides reduce virus replication in cells by a direct effect on HIV-1 RNA transcription .
Future Plans .
Our present studies show that polyamides designed to target DNA sequences 6-7 bp in length are effective inhibitors of gene transcription in cell-free systems and viral replication in human cells .
Because sequences of these lengths would be highly redundant in the human genome , it had seemed likely that these ligands would have deleterious effects on cell metabolism because of interference with the activity of cellular genes .
However , the results described here indicate that a set of two polyamides that recognize 6- to 7-bp sequences can be sufficient for gene-specific regulation in vivo .

Control gene expression .
( 4 ) The TATA box ( bold ) and flanking sequences ( from GenBank listings ) of each of the cytokine/ growth factor genes examined are shown .
The polyamide 1 binding site is underlined .
( B ) Ribonuclease protection assays for the indicated mRNAs ( 41 , 42 ) .
PBMCs were cultured and either were left untreated or were treated with 10 wM polyamides 1 + 3 or 2 + 4 for six days .
Data are expressed as the intensity of each RNA relative to the intensity of the ribosomal L32 RNA band to standardize for RNA loading .
It is interesting to compare these small molecule transcription repressors to eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins that also recognize multiple short sequences to increase functional specificity ( 27 , 34 , 35 ) .
The observations that polyamides do not interfere with pol II elongation , and that polyamides can bind simultaneously with certain major groove proteins , should further enhance gene-specificity ( 36 ) .
In addition , polyamides are not limited to 6- to 7-bp recognition .
For example , polyamides of similar size to those described here have been shown to bind as cooperative dimers to sites 10-16 bp in length ( 37 , 38 ) .
The polyamide binding site size required to elicit optimal biological function should be reported in due course .
The specific inhibition of genes transcribed by pol II represents an important first step toward asking whether cell-permeable small molecule transcription antagonists might regulate gene expression in complex organisms ( 8 ) .
We have chosen TBP and two additional key regulators of HIV-1 transcription , Ets-1 and LEF-1 , as targets for inhibition of pol II-driven transcription .
Because most tissue-specific cellular genes and viral genes contain TATA elements as well as enhancer factor binding sites , this approach may be generally applicable for the inhibition of most target genes .
