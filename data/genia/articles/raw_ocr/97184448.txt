3 Physical and Functional Interaction between the Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 Tax ; , Protein and the CCAAT Binding Protein NF-Y CYNTHIA A. PISE-MASISON , JURGEN KAREN E. anp JOHN N. BRADY* Virus Tumor Biology Section , Laboratory of Molecular Virology , National Cancer Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892-5055 Received 10 September 1996/Returned for modification 5 November 1996/Accepted 3 December 1996 Tax , , a potent activator of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transcription , has been shown to modulate expression of many cellular genes .
Tax , does not bind DNA directly but regulates transcription through protein-protein interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors .
Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins which interact with Tax ; , we isolated the B subunit of the CCAAT binding protein NF-Y from a HeLa cDNA library .
The interaction of Tax , with NF-YB was specific in that NF-YB did not interact with a variety of other transcription factors , including human immunodeficiency virus Tat , human papillomavirus E6 , and Bicoid , or with the M7 ( amino acids ~°CP-AS ) Tax , mutant .
However , NF-YB did interact with the C-terminal Tax , mutants M22 ( °TL-AS ) and M47 @ * LL-RS ) .
We also show that in vitro-translated NF-YB specifically bound to a glutathione S-transferase-Tax , fusion protein .
Further , Tax , coimmunoprecipitated with NF-Y from nuclear extracts of HTLV-1-transformed cells , providing evidence for in vivo interaction of Tax , and NF-YB .
We further demonstrate that Tax , specifically activated the NF-Y-responsive DQB promoter , as well as a minimal promoter which contains only the Y-box element .
In addition , mutation of the Y-box element alone abrogated Tax , -mediated activation .
Taken together , these data indicate that Tax ; interacts with NF-Y through the B subunit and that this interaction results in activation of the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter .
Through activation of this and other NF-Y driven promoters , the Tax , -NF-Y interaction may play a critical role in causing cellular transformation and HTLV-1 pathogenesis .
Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is the causative agent of the aggressive , usually fatal adult T-cell leukemia ( see references 22 , 23 , 48 and 86 and references therein ) .
Recent reports have linked HTLV-1 with additional and clinically diverse human diseases ( 31 , 46 , 53 , 59 , 63 , 65 ) .
The best characterized of these is a progressive demyelinating syndrome termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy ( HAM ) or tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) ( see references 22 , 23 , 48 , and 86 and references therein ) .
Because of the long incubation period between viral exposure and disease onset , the mechanism of HTLV-1 pathogenesis is still unclear .
It is clear that host cell control of HTLV-1 replication is a primary determinant of virus expression and subsequent disease .
Studies on the variation of viral sequences among different infected groups have not revealed any particular determinant which distinguishes onset of a particular HTLV-1 associated disease ( 18 , 44 , 60 , 74 , 87 , 88 ) .
In vitro , HTLV-1 has been shown to activate and immortalize human T lymphocytes , resulting in the polyclonal proliferation of infected cells and subsequent oligoclonal or monoclo-nal growth ( 26 , 43 ) .
HTLV-1 contains no known cellular proto-oncogene , and because there is no preferential site of integration among infected individuals , it is unlikely that in * Corresponding author .

1236 sertional mutagenesis is responsible for viral transformation .
Several lines of evidence suggest that the viral transcriptional activator Tax contributes to the development of disease ( 23 , 28 , 29 , 82 ) .
Tax , which is essential for viral replication ( 22 , 23 , 48 , 86 ) , has recently been shown to transform established rodent fibroblasts to anchorage-independent growth ( 77 , 82 , 85 ) .
More-over , Tax can transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts in cooperation with activated ras ( 67 ) as well as immortalize normal human T lymphocytes when expressed from a herpes simplex virus-based vector ( 28 , 29 ) .
Finally , transgenic mice carrying the Tax gene frequently develop mesenchymal tumors and neurofibromas ( 34 , 62 ) .
These findings suggest that Tax plays a critical role in -associated leukemogenesis .
Tax is believed to exert its effect by stimulating viral gene expression and by deregulating expression of cellular genes ( 22 , 23 , 48 , 86 ) .
Tax has been shown to activate transcription of a number of cellular genes involved in cell proliferation , such as those for interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , IL-2 , the IL-2 receptor , gran-ulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , c-Fos , c-Jun , parathyroid-related protein , and the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I ( see references 22 , 23 , 48 , and 86 and references therein ) .
The aberrant expression of these growth-related genes has been implicated in contributing to the establishment of HTLV-1-associated pathogenesis .
While Tax does not bind DNA directly , it appears to stimulate RNA synthesis through protein-protein interactions with host cell transcription factors .
The most well studied of these interactions is with the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors , which bind to cyclic AMP -responsive elements in the HTLV-1 long terminal repeats ( 1 , 5 , 22 , 24 , 66 , 81 , 83 , 91 ) .
Tax has also been shown to mediate transcription of a variety of cellular genes through interaction with NF- B-like factors , Ets-1 , and serum response Vor .
17 , 1997 factor ( 22 , 23 , 36 , 48 , 61 , 86 ) .
The molecular steps leading to the deregulated expression of cellular genes by Tax are not yet understood ; however , recent reports suggest that Tax may activate transcription through enhancement of the DNA binding activities of cellular transcription factors ( 4 , 5 , 24 , 56 , 83 , 91 ) .
This Tax-dependent enhancement of DNA binding activity is in part due to an increase in basic leucine zipper protein dimerization ( 4 , 7 , 10 , 83 ) .
In addition , Tax has been shown to stimulate transcription of cellular genes which contain NF-kB sites by increasing the nuclear concentration of active NF-kB complexes through protein translocation ( 36 , 57 , 61 ) .
Because of the critical role that Tax has in HTLV-1 patho-genesis , we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cellular proteins which interact with Tax .
Our studies clearly demonstrate that Tax interacts with the transcription factor NF-Y .
NF-Y is an evolutionarily conserved heteromeric DNA binding protein composed of A , B , and C subunits ( 52 , 76 ) .
NF-Y ( also called CP-1 , CBF , or YEBP ) recognizes the CCAAT motif and was initially identified by its binding to Y boxes of the MHC class II promoters ( 20 , 89 ) .
Our studies demonstrate that the B subunit of NF-Y directly interacts with Tax and that this interaction results in an activation of the MHC class II promoter .
Activation of NF-Y by Tax may also increase expression of other cellular genes which contribute to HTLV-1 induced pathogenesis .
MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA library and DNA binding domain plasmids .
HeLa cDNA library-en-coded proteins were expressed by using the 2m TRPZ galactose-inducible pJG4-5 vector ( kindly provided by Roger Brent ) , which also contains sequences coding for the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope tag , the B42 acidic activation domain , and the simian virus 40 nuclear localization signal located upstream of the cDNA ( 90 ) .
Tax genes ( wild type , M7 , M22 , and M47 ) were cloned downstream from the DNA binding dimerization domains of the LexA bacterial repressor in the Zam £H/S3 vector pL202PI .
pL202PI-based vectors expressing the Tat , E6 , or Bicoid protein were also used ( 16 ) .
Two-hybrid assay .
EGY48 ( MATa tpl ura3 his3 LEU2 : pLexAop6-LEU2 ) ( kindly provided by Roger Brent ) carrying pJK103 ( URA3 ) , which directs the expression of a GAL 1-lacZ gene from two high-affinity ColE1 LexA operators ( 90 ) , was transformed with pLexA/Tax or pLexA/M16 .
The resulting strains were transformed with the pJG4-5-based HeLa library ( TRP7 ) by the lithium acetate method of Ito et al .
( 37 ) .
A total of 8.5 X 10° primary transformants were selected on Ura~ His~ Trp~ glucose plates , scraped , and pooled .
Cells ( 3 x 10° ) from this pool were spread on four Ura : His : Trp Leu~ galactose plates .
Colonies appearing 3 days later were streaked onto Ura '' His Trp glucose plates and Ura~ His~ Trp Leu_ X-Gal ( 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-B-p-galac-topyranoside ) galactose plates .
Plasmids from blue , Leu* colonies were recovered by direct introduction into the Escherichia coli K-12 strain KCS pyrF : :Tn5 hsdR 1euB600 trpC9830 lacD74 strA galK hisB436 by electroporation as described by Marcil and Higgins ( 54 ) .
The cDNA clones were sorted into a total of 12 classes based on restriction enzyme digestion patterns .
At least one representative cDNA from each class was partially sequenced to establish identity by using the Sequenase system ( U.S. Biochemicals ) .
Two identical , independently isolated , full-length NF-YB clones were recovered .
B-Galactosidase assays .
Quantitative B-galactosidase assays with o-nitrophe-nyl-B-p-galactosidase were performed on permeabilized cells essentially as described by Ausubel et al .
( 6 ) .
Expression of the pJG4-5 Gall promoter was induced by shaking cultures overnight in Ura Trp His~ Leu~ galactose medium at 30°C .
The cells were washed in ultrapure water and suspended to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2/ml in buffer Z ( 10 mM KCI , 1 mM MgSO , , 60 mM Na , PO , , 40 mM NaH , PO , ) .
Cells ( 1.0 ml ) were permeabilized by addition of 15 pl of 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) and 20 pl of chloroform followed by a 10-s vortex .
After incubation of the samples at 30°C for 10 min , 0.2 ml of o-nitrophenyl-B-p-galactoside ( 4 mg/ml !
in buffer Z ) was added , and incubation at 30°C was continued for 15 min .
The reactions were terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of 1 M Na , COs ; .
The cells were pelleted , and the optical density at 420 nm of the supernatant was determined .
Cell lines and nuclear extracts .
All cell lines were maintained at a density of 1 X 10° to 2 X 10° cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 mM glutamine and 10 % fetal bovine serum .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Schreiber et al .
( 72 ) from Jurkat and CEM ( American Type Culture Collection ) T-cell lines , as well as from the HTLV-1-transformed cell lines C81 and MT2 .
The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and suspended in buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 100 wM EDTA , 100 wM EGTA , 500 wM INTERACTION OF HTLV-1 Tax AND CCAAT BINDING PROTEIN NF-Y - 1237 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] , 1 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 10 mM KCI ) at a density of 10° cells per 400 pl .
After incubation on ice for 15 min , Nonidet P-40 ( NP-40 ) was added to a final concentration of 0.6 % , and the samples were vortexed for 10 s. Nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 x g for 30 s at room temper-ature .
The pellets were suspended in 50 pl of buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF ) and rocked at 4°C for 15 min to extract proteins .
Extracts were centrifuged ( 10,000 x g ) for 5 min at 4°C , the supernatants were transferred to new tubes , and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) .
Protein analysis .
Nuclear extracts ( 300 mg ) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with either NF-YA antibody ( 10 ug ) or immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibody ( 10 mg ) of the same isotype in a final volume of 100 pl .
The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) to capture antibody-protein complexes .
The samples were washed four times with wash buffer ( 120 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 200 uM sodium vanadate , 50 mM NaF , 0.5 % NP-40 , 50 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 7.4 ] , 5 mM EDTA with 1 ag of leupeptin per ml and 18 g of aprotinin per ml ) , and the proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and separated in 4 to 20 % polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels ( Novex ) .
Fifty micrograms of nuclear extract was run as a control .
The gels were analyzed by immunoblotting as described by Ausubel et al .
( 6 ) with antiserum specific for Tax ( 14 ) , NF-YA ( Rockland Inc. ) , or NF-¥B ( a kind gift from Robert Mantovani ) and visualized by chemilumi-nescence ( Amersham } .
GST binding assay .
Five hundred nanograms of purified glutathione S-trans-ferase ( GST ) or GST-Tax was incubated with 30 pl of a 50 % slurry of glutathione-Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) for 1 h at 4°C .
The beads were washed three times in binding buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.5 ] , 100 mM KCI , 20 % glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) to remove unbound proteins and suspended in 200 pl of binding buffer .
Radiolabeled NF-YA , NF-YB , and YB-1 proteins were synthesized in vitro by using the TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulo-cyte lysate system ( Promega ) and radiolabeled with 40 Ci of ( > 1,000 Ci/mmol ) ( Amersham ) in a 50-pl volume .
The in vitro-translated mixtures ( 5 pl ) were added to either GST or GST-Tax coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads .
The samples were rotated at 4°C for 3 h and washed three times in binding buffer plus 0.5 % NP-40 , and the proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer .
The proteins were separated by electro-phoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide-SDS gels and analyzed by autoradiography .
Northern blot analysis .
mRNAs from human T-cell lines and an osteosarcoma cell line were prepared and transferred to nylon membranes as described by Dittmer et al .
( 19 ) .
Gel-purified oligonucleotide probes ( DQB [ 5'-GGTCGTG CGGAGCTCCAACTGGTAGTTGTGTCTGCACACCGTGTCCA-3 ' and NE-YB [ 5-CCGTTTCTCTTGATGGCACCTTTCACTTGC-3 ' ] ) were end labeled by using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs ) in the presence of [ y-*°P ] dATP ( > 3,000 Ci/mmol ! )
as described by the manufacturer .
Electroporations and CAT assays .
Jurkat cells cultured to a density of 1 x 10° cells/ml were washed once in PBS and suspended in RPMI 1640 at 2.5 x 10° cells/ml .
DNA diluted in 50 pl of distilled water was added to 250 pl of cells and electroporated with the Gibco BRL Cell Porator Electroporation System at 250 V and 800 pF .
The cells were chilled on ice for 30 min and suspended in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum .
Cells were harvested at 24 to 36 h posttransfection , washed twice with PBS , suspended in 100 pl of 0.25 M Tris-Cl ( pH 7.5 ) , subjected to three cycles of freezing-thawing , and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activity ( 6 ) .
Conversion was quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager .
All other promoter constructs were derived from pDQBCAT ( kindly provided by Elliot P. Cowan ) , which contains the MHC class II DQB promoter cloned upstream of the CAT gene in pBLCAT3 ( 50 ) .
pAH/PCAT , which lacks promoter sequences upstream of the Y box , was designed by deletion of the internal HindIII-to-PpuMI restriction fragment .
pAB/PCAT with the Y box deleted was constructed by digestion of pDQBCAT with PpuMI and BsmFI , and restriction sites were blunt ended with mung bean nuclease prior to ligation .
The Y-box mutant pBclICAT was constructed by digesting pDQBCAT with BsmFI and PpuMI and ligating the complementary oligonucleotide 5 -GTCCTTCAGCTCCAGTGCTGATCATTIT CTTTTCCGAGGGACCATCCAATCC-3 ' .
All mutant constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequence analysis .
Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
The gel-purified oligonucleotide 5'-TCCAGTGCTGATIGGTTITTCCGAGGGA-3 ' ( 100 ng ) , which contains the Y-box element , was end labeled by using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [ y- > °P ] dATP ( > 3,000 Ci/mmol ! )
and made double stranded by annealing to 100 ng of the gel-purified antisense oligonucleotide .
Nuclear extracts ( 6 ug ) were preincubated for 10 min at 4°C with 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) and 100 ng of unlabeled competitor DNA or 1 ug of antibody in ( final concentrations ) 12.5 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) -6.25 mM MgC1 , -0.05 % NP-40-5 mM ZnS $ O , -50 mM KC-50 pg of bovine serum albumin per ml-10 % glycerol .

RESULTS Isolation of NF-YB in a yeast two-hybrid library screen .
Tax , expressed as a fusion to LexA , was used as bait to screen a conditionally expressed cDNA library by using the yeast two-hybrid system .
Two identical independent clones of the B subunit of the human CCAAT binding protein NF-Y were isolated and chosen for further analysis .
We examined the specificity of the NF-YB-Tax interaction by testing the ability of NF-YB fused to an acidic activation domain to interact with a panel of different LexA fusion proteins ( Table 1 ) .
A 27-fold increase over background B-galactosidase activity was produced in strains which contained LexA-Tax and NF-YB .
In reciprocal assays in which NF-YB was expressed as the bait and Tax was expressed as the prey , B-galactosidase levels were 43-fold above the background level , supporting the initial observation of Tax-NF-YB interaction .
M22 ( °°TL-AS ) and M47 ( @ *°LL-RS ) , mutant derivatives of Tax that have differential abilities to activate the HTLV-1 and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) long terminal repeats ( 78 ) , interact with NF-YB at levels equivalent to or greater than what is observed with wild-type Tax ( Table 1 ) .
NF-YB did not interact with LexA or with the transactivators Bicoid , Tat , and E6 .
Interestingly , NF-YB failed to interact with the Tax mutant M7 ( ? °CP-AS ) ( 78 ) , which is defective in activating transcription from the HTLV-1 or human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeats in mammalian cells .
Although the M7 mutation does not allow Tax to localize to the nucleus , when fused to the LexA DNA binding domain this mutant was able to enter the nucleus as determined by repression assays ( 6 ) and thus to provide information on Tax-NF-YB interaction .
Together these results demonstrate that NF-YB specifically interacts with Tax in the two-hybrid system .
Interaction of Tax with NF-YB .
We next examined the interaction of Tax with NF-YB through capture by GST-Tax fusion proteins .

7 , and 8 ) , NF-YB ( lanes 2 , 4 , and 5 ) , or YB-1 ( lanes 3 , 6 , and 7 ) was incubated with purified GST or GST-Tax proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose ( Fig .
1B ) .
GST -Tax , but not GST , allowed the efficient capture ( 15 % ) of NF-YB ( Fig .
1A , compare lanes 4 and 5 ) .
In contrast , transcription factor YB-1 , which has also been shown to bind to the Y box of the MHC class II promoter ( 58 , 68 , 70 , 84 ) , failed to bind to either GST or GST-Tax ( Fig .
1A , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Interestingly , the A subunit of NF-Y ( Fig .
1A , lanes 1 , 8 , and 9 ) also failed to bind to GST-Tax over background GST binding , demonstrating specificity of Tax-NF-YB interaction .
We next analyzed the intracellular association of NF-YB and Tax by coimmunoprecipitation analysis with Tax-expressing HTLV-1-transformed T cells .
Nuclear extracts were prepared ( see Materials and Methods ) from both Jurkat and C81 ( HTLV-1-transformed ) T-cell lines .
Although C81 cells do not produce virus , they constitutively express Tax protein from an integrated copy of the HTLV-1 genome .
The relative amounts of NF-YA , NF-YB , and Tax detected in 50 pg of nuclear extract from the two cell lines are shown in Fig .
2A .
NF-YA and NF-YB proteins are detected in both cell lines .
The NF-Y protein levels appear to be slightly higher in nuclear extracts prepared from C81 cells .
Tax is detected only in C81 cells , and equivalent levels of the general transcription factor Spl are detected in both cell lines .
Antibodies directed against the NF-YA subunit were used for testing the Tax-NF-YB interaction in vivo since the antibody to NF-YB fails to immunopre-cipitate NF-Y complexes .
Nuclear extracts immunoprecipitated with NF- YA antibody coprecipitated Tax , while a control IgG antibody of the same isotype failed to coprecipitate Tax ( Fig .
2B ) .
In Western blot analysis ( as in Fig .
2A ) , NF-YA antibody did not cross-react with Tax , indicating that Tax is not directly immunoprecipitated by anti-NF-YA .
These same results were observed with the HTLV-1-transformed cell line MT2 ( data not shown ) .
NF-Y-Tax complexes could not be detected when anti-Tax antibodies were used .
However , this may be due to disruption of the complex upon antibody binding , or the antibodies we have used may block the interaction .
Since we observed an interaction with Tax and NF-YB in the two-hybrid and GST binding assays , the interaction of Tax with the NF-Y complex by coimmunoprecipitation is probably through its interaction with the NF-YB subunit .
Consistent with this notion , the A subunit of NF-Y , although present in our cDNA library as determined by PCR analysis ( data not shown ) , was not identified in the interactive screen .
In addition , NF-YA did not bind to GST-Tax .

Tax binds to NF-Y in HTLV-1-transformed cells .

( B ) The same extracts ( 300 ug ) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either NF-YA or mouse anti-rabbit IgG antibody .
The captured proteins were compared to 50 ug of nuclear extracts of Jurkat and C81 cells by immunoblot analysis with Tax antibody after separation on 4 to 20 % polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels .
The band marked with an asterisk indicates the IgG heavy chain .
Numbers on the left are molecular weights in thousands .
coimmunoprecipitated with NF-YA demonstrates that the binding of Tax to NF-YB does not dissociate NF-YB from the NF-Y heterotrimer , and thus the complex could still be capable of binding DNA .
Increased expression of MHC class II DQ .
Previous studies have established that NF-Y is a critical factor in MHC class II gene expression and that MHC class II gene expression is increased in HTLV-1-infected cells ( 3 , 25 , 38 , 47 , 51 , 64 ) .
Therefore , we sought to determine what effect the interaction of Tax with NF-Y has on the expression of MHC class II genes .
Since the HTLV-1 activation of the MHC class II DQ promoter has not been examined at the RNA level , we first determined the relative levels of MHC class II DQB one of the three class II alleles ) mRNA from T-cell lines which were either HTLV-1 negative ( Jurkat and CEM ) or HTLV-1 positive ( HUT-102 , MT-2 , and C81 ) .
A dramatic increase in MHC class II transcription was seen in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines compared to Jurkat and CEM cell lines ( Fig .
3A ) .
In contrast , the levels of NF-YB message ( Fig .
3B ) were approximately equal in all cell lines examined .
To better characterize the effect of Tax on the HLA-DQ promoter , we tested the ability of Tax to transactivate the wild-type and mutant DQB promoters in Jurkat T cells by using transient-transfection assays ( Fig .
4A ) .
Tax caused an increase in expression of the wild-type DQB construct in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
4C ) .
When the mutant constructs were compared , the level of Tax expression was similar in each promoter construct transfection ( Fig .
5B ) ; however , differences in CAT activity were observed .
Tax had no effect on expression from the vector alone , whereas a fivefold increase in CAT activity from the MHC class II promoter ( pDQCAT ) was observed ( Fig .
5A ) .
A threefold increase in activity was seen INTERACTION OF HTLV-1 Tax AND CCAAT BINDING PROTEIN NF-Y - 1239 when the Y-box and CCAAT sequences were the only elements directing CAT expression ( pAH/PCAT ) .
Deletion of both the Y box and the CCAAT element ( pAB/PCAT ) ( Fig .
5A ) abolished promoter activity .
When we mutated the Y box in the context of the full-length promoter ( pBclICAT ) , the basal promoter was active ; however , Tax-mediated transactivation was abrogated .
To determine whether this mutation prevented NF-Y binding to the Y box , gel shift assays were performed .
As shown in Fig .
5C , lane 4 , an oligonucleotide containing the Bcell mutation was unable to compete with the wild-type Y-box element for NF-Y binding .
The wild-type Y-box oligonucleotide did compete for NF-Y binding , and anti-NF-YA antibody supershifted the NF-Y complex to the well ( Fig .
5C , lanes 2 and 5 , respectively ) .
These results support the hypothesis that the Y box is the Tax-responsive element in the MHC class II promoter .
Tax mutants M22 and M47 activated transcription of the MHC class II promoter ( Fig .
5A ) .
This is consistent with the data obtained with the two-hybrid system , in which both M22 and M47 were capable of interacting with NF-YB ( Table 1 ) .
The Tax mutant M22 is capable of interacting with CREB and thus can activate CREB-driven promoters such as the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat .
However , M22 does not interact with NF- « B and , unlike wild-type Tax , can not activate NF-kB promoters ( 78 ) .
The M47 mutant has the reverse phenotype from that of M22 ( 78 ) .
Since M22 and M47 are capable of activating the DQB promoter , these data argue that NF-kB and CREB factors are not involved in the Tax-mediated activation of the MHC class II promoter .
Since the Tax mutant M7 does not localize to the nucleus ( 78 ) , it was not included in these studies .
Taken together , these data indicate that Tax can increase expression of the MHC class II promoter and that this increase is a consequence of its interaction with NF-Y .
DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that Tax can interact with the CCAAT binding factor NF-Y and activate transcription of the MHC class II DQB gene , a gene involved in cellular differentiation and activation ( 20 , 89 ) .
It has previously been shown that the transcription of other genes involved in cellular acti- E o A - g.g8 , < 4eCL -~ $ 832258 28 S o “ DQB 18S B .

( C ) Increasing amounts of peTax ( 2 , 4 , or 8 pg ) or the vector alone ( 4 mg ) was cotransfected with 5 mg of pDQBCAT into Jurkat T cells .
Cell lysates were collected 24 h later and assayed for CAT activity .
The bars represent the average values from three or more independent experiments .
vation and proliferation is also transcriptionally activated by Tax ( 22 , 23 , 48 , 86 ) .
Abnormal expression of such factors or receptors involved in cell growth may be one of the key events that ultimately leads to the development of adult T-cell leukemia or TSP/HAM .
MHC class II genes are comprised of a large family of highly polymorphic heterodimeric glycoproteins .
The functional consequence of this variation is the regulation and restriction of the cellular immune response , since the structure of each class II molecule determines which peptide sequences are presented to lymphoid cells ( 58 , 68 , 70 ) .
The MHC class II-peptide complexes determine the repertoire of mature T cells and the activation of CD4 * T cells and thus play a fundamental role in the homeostasis of the immune response .
Quantitative and qualitative changes in the expression of MHC class II molecules on the cell surface dramatically affect the onset of the immune response and may be the basis of a wide variety of disease states ( 51 ) .
By cell surface staining , the MHC class II molecule has been shown to be elevated in peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from HTLV-1-infected patients as compared to normal donors ( 3 , 47 , 64 , 92 ) .
In addition , HTLV-1 Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
infection of neuroblastoma cells or transfection of a glial cell line with Tax demonstrated that Tax activated the expression of MHC class II in these cells ( 47 ) .
Similarly , infection by bovine leukemia virus , a member of the same family of oncogenic retroviruses as HTLV-1 and -2 , causes an increase in MHC class II expression by infected B and T lymphocytes ( 79 ) .
Iwakura et al .
( 38 ) reported that as a consequence of overex-pression of MHC genes and inflammatory cytokines , transgenic mice which express the HTLV-1 pX and env regions develop an autoimmune chronic inflammatory arthropathy resembling rheumatoid arthritis .
In addition , evidence suggests that certain class II MHC molecules are associated with human rheumatoid arthritis ( 30 ) .
Further , Hasunuma et al .
( 33 ) have recently reported the presence of specific cytotoxic T cells against Tax-bearing synoviocytes and augmentation of HLA class II molecules on the cell surface of HTLV-1 synoviocytes .
Although latent viral replication in circulating infected T lymphocytes is a common feature of HTLV infection , the percentage of circulating HTLV-infected T lymphocytes is significantly increased in HAM/TSP patients ( 27 , 39 , 45 ) as compared to in asymptomatic carriers .
In addition , HTLV-1-specific CD4* HLA class II-restricted and CD8 * class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes have been demonstrated in peripheral blood lymphocytes of HAM/TSP patients ( 39 , 40 ) .
This increase in cytotoxic T lymphocytes is hypothesized to induce pathogenesis not only in HAM/TSP patients but also in patients with arthri-tis , uveitis , and Sjorgen 's disease ( 41 ) .
Therefore , Tax greatly contributes not only to cellular proliferation but also to induction of an immune response through deregulation of MHC expression .
Our observation that Tax interacts with and activates transcription through NF-Y provides a mechanism for this HTLV-1-induced expression of class II molecules .
The primary regulation of class II molecule expression is at the level of transcription , which is both cell type and development stage specific ( 11 , 17 , 58 , 68 , 70 ) .
Our work demonstrates that the increase in MHC class II expression on HTLV-1-transformed T cells is due to an increase in the level of MHC class II mRNA .
The MHC class II promoters share conserved sequence motifs , which include the W , X , X2 , and Y boxes .
Nuclear factors which bind to these sequences have been iden-tified , and some have been cloned ( 17 , 68 , 70 , 84 ) .
Reports have shown that binding of the factors which control the class II promoter is cooperative and that NF-Y binding facilitates in vivo recruitment of upstream transcription factors ( 69 , 84 ) .
In this paper , we clearly demonstrate that Tax can activate transcription of the DQB promoter through the NF-Y element .
In addition , we find that Tax is able to directly interact with the NF-YB subunit .
Recently , Matsuzaki et al .
( 55 ) have shown that Tax can interact with a CREB-like factor , TREBS5 , which binds to the X region of the MHC class II promoter , suggesting that Tax can activate transcription through this element .
In our hands , the X box ( AH/PCAT ) is dispensable for Tax transcriptional activation of the DQ promoter .
However , transactivation of the class II promoter by Tax is elevated when the X box is present , suggesting a possible cooperative effect of Tax-NF-Y and an upstream factor ( s ) .
NF-Y is an evolutionarily conserved heteromeric CCAAT binding protein composed of A , B , and C subunits , all of which are required for DNA binding activity .
Recently it has been shown that the subunits of NF-Y associate in a 1:1:1 ratio and that association occurs in an ordered fashion ( 75 ) .
The B and C subunits must bind each other before the A subunit can bind .
Interestingly , NF-YB and NF-YC were identified as having H2B and H2A histone-fold motifs , respectively ( 8 ) .
This implies that the mechanism by which the B and C subunits interact with each other to form dimers is similar to that of HZA Vou .

Tax activation of the DQ promoter .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with 5 ug of the indicated CAT reporter plasmid and 4 pg of cither pCMV vector ( - ) or pcTax ( + ) and assayed 24 h later for CAT activity .
Shown is a representative assay , with the percent conversion ( Conver ) of chloramphenicol and fold increase by Tax listed below the lanes .
( B ) Samples from each transfection were assayed by immunoblot analysis to determine the level of Tax expressed .
Numbers on the left are molecular weights in thousands .
( C ) Nuclear extracts of Jurkat T cells ( 6 pg ) were incubated with 1 ng of *°P-labeled Y-box sequence either alone ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of 1 pg of wild-type ( W.T . )
( lane 2 ) , mutant ( Mut ) ( lane 3 ) , or Bell mutant ( Bell ) ( lane 4 ) competitor DNA .
In addition , 6 g of extracts was preincubated with either 1 pg of NF-YA antibody or 1 mg of IgG antibody of the same isotype ( lanes 5 and 6 , respectively ) .
The NF-Y-bound complex and free probe are indicated .
and H2B .
Tax could facilitate complex formation between NF-YB and NF-YC , driving the formation of an A-B-C complex and thus elevating the level of active NF-Y DNA binding factors .
Alternatively , Tax could be stabilizing NF-Y complexes through its interaction with NF-YB and/or could increase the nuclear localization of NF-Y , similar to what is seen for NF- « B ( 35 , 42 ) .
To date there has been no evidence of an inhibitor of NF-Y , but the possibility exists .
In a report by Schmidt and Schilber ( 71 ) , describing a difference in regulation between NF-YA and NF- YB , it was suggested that the levels of NF-YB are regulated posttranslationally .
This could again be achieved by nuclear localization , protein stabilization , or both .
There is no obvious nuclear localization signal in NF-YB , yet the majority of the protein is found in the nucleus ( 9 ) .
Since NF-Y is a heteromeric complex , the stoichiometric levels of the A , B , and C subunits may be maintained in a manner analogous to that which makes stability of IxB dependent on levels of NF-kB ( 12 , 73 , 80 ) .
NF-Y has recently been shown to bind to CCAAT motifs in the promoters of several eukaryotic and viral genes .
Several of these genes are involved in cellular regulation , such as those for human thymidine kinase , IL-4 , fibroblast growth factor-4 , and ribonucleotide reductase R2 ( 13 , 14 , 21 , 32 , 49 ) .
NF-Y binding sites have also been reported in the cell cycle regulators CDC25C and CDC2 ( 15 , 93 ) both of which are important for progression through G , /M .
Recently , another important regulator of the cell cycle , the tumor suppressor protein p53 , has been shown to bind to NF-Y on the hsp70 promoter , causing a repression in transcription ( 2 ) .
The interaction of Tax with NF-Y in HTLV-1-transformed cells suggests that Tax not only transcriptionally activates MHC class II genes but may also activate other cellular genes regulated by NF-Y .
This interaction may also have an important impact on regulation of the cell cycle .
Therefore , the interaction that we observe be tween Tax and NF-Y may play a critical role in cellular transformation and ultimately contribute to HTLV-1 disease .
