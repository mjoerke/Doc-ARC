As a first step toward elucidating the function of Cbl in TCR-initiated signaling , we evaluated the ability of wild-type Cbl or a transforming Cbl mutant ( 702/83 ) to induce transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) element derived from the interleukin 2 ( L2 ) promoter in transiently cotransfected Jurkat-TAg T cells .
702/3 , but not Chl , caused NFAT activation which was significantly enhanced by stimulation with calcium ionophore , and was drastically reduced by cyclosporin A pretreatment .
A point mutation of a potential phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) binding site ( Y '' * '' *EAM to Y '' **EAC ) in 70 % /3 disrupted the association of PI3-K with 702/83 , but did not reduce the induction of NFAT activity , suggesting that the interaction between Chl and PI3-K is not required in the 70 % /3-mediated induction of NFAT .
Additional mapping studies indicated that defined deletions of C-terminal 702/83 sequences affected to a variable degree its ability to stimulate NFAT activity .
Strikingly , deletion of 346 C-terminal residues augmented this activity , whereas removal of 20 additional residues abolished it .
Coexpres-sion of dominant negative Ras abrogated the basal or ionomycin-stimulated , 702/3-mediated NFAT activation , suggesting a functional Ras is required for this activation .
These results implicate Chl in Ras-dependent signaling pathways which lead to NFAT activation .
The c-cbl protooncogene is the cellular homologue of v-cbi , a transforming gene of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus .
The v-cbi oncogene was generated as a result of a rearrangement between Cas-Br-M virus and a sequence encoding the 355 N-terminal residues of the c-cbl product .
This oncogene induces pro-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias in mice ( 1 ) .
The 120-kDa product of c-cbl consists of a highly basic N-terminal region , a zinc Ring finger , multiple proline-rich sequences , and several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites ( 2 ) .
While the transforming v-cbl product can be detected both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus , c-Cbl is exclusively cytosolic and lacks transforming activity ( 3 ) .
Another c-cbl mutant isolated from the murine 70/3 pre-B cell lymphoma encodes a protein with an internal deletion of 17 amino acids near the zinc Ring finger .

This mutation ( 702/83 ) also activates the transforming potential of c-cbl , and the corresponding protein displays enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation ( 4 ) .
Several recent findings support the notion that Cbl is involved in signal transduction pathways : first , the proline-rich domain of Cbl mediates constitutive associations with SH3 domains of adaptor signaling proteins , i.e. , Grb2 ( 5-8 ) and Neck ( 9 ) ; second , engagement of different receptors , including the epidermal growth factor receptor ( 10-14 ) and cytokine receptors ( 7 , 14-16 ) causes an increase in the phosphotyrosine ( Tyr ( P ) ) ' content of Cbl , and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl associates with SH2 domains of the regulatory subunit ( p85 ) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI38-K ) ( 5-7 , 13 , 17 , 18 ) and Crk ( 19-21 ) in an activation-dependent manner .
Third , we found recently that in T cells , Cbl interacts with 14-3-3 proteins , and that this association is increased upon TCR stimulation ( 22 ) .
14-3-3 proteins are thought to participate in signal transduction pathways via their association with different oncogene and protooncogene products ( 23 , 24 ) .
Despite all of these findings , however , the physiological function of mammalian Cbl remains unclear .
Cbl is also likely to participate in signaling pathways initiated by the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) -CD3 complex and other immune recognition receptors , i.e .
the B cell antigen receptor ( 18 , 25 ) , and the IgG-Fc receptor ( 14 , 26 ) .
TCR-CD3 ligation by processed antigenic peptides or anti-receptor antibodies leads to activation of protein tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk families ( 27 , 28 ) which , in turn , phosphorylate multiple cellular proteins .
These early events trigger signal transduction cascades which lead to T cell activation , lymphokine production , and proliferation .
Cbl was recently identified as a prominent protein tyrosine kinase substrate in TCR-stimu-lated T cells ( 5 , 6 , 21 , 29 ) , and was found to associate with two protein tyrosine kinases , i.e .
Fyn ( 5 , 29 , 30 ) and ZAP-70 ( 30 ) , in activated T cells .
Furthermore , ZAP-70 causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in an Lck- and Fyn-dependent manner ( 30 ) , indicating that Cbl may couple ZAP-70 to downstream signaling events during T cell activation .
In order to begin to address the role of Cbl in TCRCD3-mediated signaling , we evaluated the effects of wild-type or a mutated form ( 702/83 ) of Cbl on the transcriptional activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , using transient transfection assays in Jurkat T cells .
NFAT is a transcription factor complex that plays a critical role in the induction of interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) and other cytokine genes , and the two signal requirement for its activation mimicks the requirement for optimal proliferation and IL2 production in TCR-CD3-activated T cells ( 31 , 32 ) .

We report that transient overexpression of 70 % /3 ( but not wild-type Cbl ) induces an increase in the basal activity of NFAT , which is further enhanced synergistically by calcium ionophore .
This NFAT induction is dependent on both calcineurin and functional Ras .
These results provide evidence that Cbl is involved in Ras-dependent T cell signaling pathways that lead to the transcriptional activation of cytokine genes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies-The anti-CD3e monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , OKT3 , was purified from culture supernatants of the corresponding hybridoma by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography .
Polyclonal rabbit anti-Chl antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
The 4G10 anti-Tyr ( P ) mAb and a rabbit anti-p85 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ) .
Anti-hemagglutinin ( HA ; 12CA5 ) or anti-Grb2 mAbs were from Boehringer Mannheim and Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) , respectively .
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG F ( ab ' ) , fragments were from Amersham Corp. Plasmids-The cDNAs encoding human c-Cbl , v-Cbl , or the homologue of murine 702/83 ( representing an internal 17-amino acid deletion of Cbl ) were subcloned from the pGEM-2z vector into a mammalian expression vector , pEFneo ( 83 ) at the EcoRI and Xbal sites to generate pEFneo-Cbl , pEFneo-v-Cbl , and pEFneo-702/8 , respectively .
A sequence encoding an HA tag epitope has been added to the 5 end of the 702/83 cDNA by a standard polymerase chain reaction .
A methionine to cysteine mutation at a potential PIS-K-binding motif in Cbl ( Y**EAM ) was introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a cDNA fragment encoding the Y*EAC mutation and ligation of the product into the TA cloning vector ( InVitrogen ) .
The sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing , and the cDNA fragment digested with SnaBI and Xbal was ligated into pEFneo-702/3 which has been digested with the corresponding enzymes to create the expression vector .
To construct expression plasmids encoding 702/83 proteins with successive deletions of their 114 , 176 , 346 , 866 , or 456 C-terminal residues , internal restriction sites or a point mutation were used to generate plasmids Al ( deletion of an EcoRV-Xbal fragment ) , A2 ( deletion of a SnaBI-Xbal fragment ) , A8 ( point mutation of the proline-560 codon to a stop codon by polymerase chain reaction ) , A4 ( deletion of a Bgill-Xbal fragment ) , and A5 ( deletion of a Sacl-Xbal fragment ) , respectively ( see Fig .
5A ) .
These deletions removed distinct proline-rich sequences of the protein .
The deletion mutants were ligated into the pEFneo vector .
The luciferase reporter plasmids , NFAT-Lue and IL2-Luc , were generous gifts from Dr. G. Grabtree ; AP-1-Lue and were kindly provided by Dr. M. Karin .
The dominant negative H-RasN17 plasmid in the pcDNA vector was obtained from Dr. H. Wang .
Cell Culture and Transfection-Simian virus 40 T antigen ( TAg ) -transfected human leukemic Jurkat T cells ( Jurkat-TAg ) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Harlan , Indianapolis , IN ) , L-glutamine , and antibi-otics .
Cells in a logarithmic growth phase were transfected with the indicated amount ( usually 10 pg ) of Cbl plasmid DNA and 5 pug of the reporter plasmid by electroporation as described previously ( 22 , 34 ) .
The cells were transferred to 24-well plate 24 h later and cultured in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2 % fetal calf serum for 4-6 h. The transfected cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-CD38e mAb ( OKT3 ; 10 ug/m1 ) , ionomycin ( 100 ng/m ! 1 ) , and/or phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; 10 ng/ml ) for another 8-10 h. In some experiments , the cells were treated in triplicate with cyclosporin A ( 50 ng/ml ) for 10 min prior to stimulation .
In order to assess the effect of dominant negative Ras , the cells were transfected with a mixture of 5 ug of pEFneo-702/83 , 10 ug of RasN17 , and 5 ug of reporter plasmid DNAs .
Similar amounts of the corresponding empty vectors were used as controls in all transfection experiments .
Luciferase Assay-Transfected Jurkat-TAg cells were harvested and lysed in 100 pl of lysis buffer ( 100 mM KPO , , pH 7.8 , 10 mM dithiothre-itol , 0.2 % Triton X-100 ) for 10 min at room temperature .
The lysates were then centrifuged ( 15,000 x g , 5 min ) , and their protein content was determined in an ELISA plate reader ( Bio-Rad ) using a Bio-Rad microassay .
Aliquots of the lysates ( 80-50 ul ) normalized to the same protein concentration were mixed with 100 ul of assay buffer ( 17.5 mM glycyl-glycine , pH 7.8 , 10 mM MgCl , , 5 mM ATP , 0.185 mM coenzyme A , 0.285 mM luciferin ) .
Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate and expressed as arbitrary units ( AU ) .
The standard deviation among triplicates was < 10 % , and each experiment was repeated at least three times .
Immunoprecipitation , Immunoblotting , and PI3-K Assoy-Immuno-precipitation , immunoblotting , and PIS-K enzymatic assays were performed as described previously ( 22 , 34 ) .
RESULTS Overexpression of 70Z/3 Induces NFAT Activity Which Is Synergistic with Ionomycin Stimulation-To explore whether Cbl or 70Z % /3 can transduce signals leading to IL2 gene transcription , we evaluated the effects of cotransfected Cbl or 702/83 cDNA on the transcriptional activity of an IL2 promoter-re-porter plasmid ( IL2-Luc ) , or reporters corresponding to defined response elements in the IL2 promoter , i.e. , NFAT-Luc , NFxB-Luc or AP-1-Luc , in Jurkat-TAg cells .
Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity following culture in low serum-containing medium and stimulation with ionomycin and/or PMA .
As shown in Fig .
1A , when the full-length Cbl was transfected into unstimulated Jurkat T cells , no increase ( or a slight decrease ) in NFAT activity was observed by comparison with the empty control vector .
Similarly , Cbl did not activate NFAT in ionomy-cin- or PMA-stimulated cells .
In contrast , transient overexpression of 702/383 induced a ~3-4-fold increase of NFAT activity in unstimulated cells , and stimulation of the 70 % /3-transfected cells with ionomycin which was minimally active by itself ( ~2-fold activation ) , but not with PMA , resulted in a synergistic effect ( ~70-fold NFAT activation ) .
Cbl or 702/83 did not cause detectable activation of AP-1 , and 70 % /3 overexpression led to only a slight induction of the IL2 promoter and NFkB under unstimulated or stimulated conditions ( data not shown ) .
To rule out the possibility that the observed difference between Cbl and 702/3 was due to different expression levels of the two proteins , we assessed protein expression by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-Cbl antibody .
As shown in Fig .
1B , transient transfection of Cbl or 702/83 increased the intracellular level of a 120-kDa protein which was recognized by anti-Cbl antibody to a similar degree .
The 70 % /3 protein could also be detected with an anti-HA antibody , since an HA tag was added to its N terminus ( Fig .
1B ) .
Collectively , these results indicate that 702/83 is constitutively active in T cells in terms of its ability to induce NFAT-dependent transcription , and synergizes with a Ca '' `` -dependent signal in this regard .
The former observation is consistent with the finding that 70 % /3 can transform fibroblasts ( 4 ) .
Calcineurin , a calcium-calmodulin dependent phosphatase which plays a critical role in NFAT induction , is a major target for the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 ( 35 , 36 ) .
To determine whether 70¥/3-induced NFAT activation is dependent on calcineurin , the cells were pretreated with cyclosporin A .
As shown in Fig .
1C , cyclosporin A blocked the ionomycin-stimulated increase in NFAT activity in cells transfected with the empty vector , as well as the synergistic effect of 702/83 plus ionomycin .
This suggests that functional calcineurin is required for the 70 % /3-mediated signal which leads to the transactivation of NFAT .
v-Cbl Fails to Activate NFAT-Cbl was originally isolated as a product of a transforming viral oncogene ( v-cbl ) .
Since both v-Cbl ( 1 ) and 70 % /3 ( 4 ) possess transforming activity , we wished to determine whether v-Cbl shares with 702/38 the ability to activate NFAT .
When cells expressing the NFAT-Luc reporter plasmid were cotransfected with 702/3 , an increase of 3- and 60-fold in NFAT activity was detected in the absence or presence of ionomycin stimulation , respectively , consistent with the results shown in Fig .
1 .
In contrast , cotransfection with the v-Cbl expression vector failed to stimulate the basal or ionomycin-induced NFAT activity ( Fig .
24 ) .

was not due to different expression levels of 70/3 and v-Cbl , since immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody revealed similar expression levels of the two transfected proteins ( Fig .
2B ) .
Therefore , despite the fact that both v-Cbl and 702/83 display transforming activity , only is capable of activating NFAT , suggesting that transformation by the two proteins involves different mechanisms .
70Z/3-mediated NFAT Activation Is Independent of PI3-K Association with 70Z/3-TCR-CD3 cross-linking causes rapid tyrosine phophorylation of Cbl which , in turn , leads to an association of Cbl with PI3-K in an activation-dependent manner ( 5 , 6 , 17 , 29 ) .

2. v-Cbl does not activate NFAT .
A , Jurkat-TAg cells were cotransfected with the NFAT-Luc reporter plasmid plus pEFneo , pEF-neo-702/3 , or pEFneo-v-cbl , left unstimulated or stimulated with ionomycin as indicated , and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity .

or CD28-mediated signaling events leading to IL2 transcription ( 37 , 38 ) .
Thus , we wished to address the possibility that an activation-induced CbI/PI3-K association plays a role in the observed NFAT activation mediated by 702/38 .
Cbl contains two potential PI3-K-binding motifs ( 39 ) , ie. , Y° CEM and Y¥ '' *EAM which may mediate binding to the SH2 domain of p85 ( 17 ) .
The first of these motifs is deleted in 70 % /3 ( 4 ) .
To examine whether the Y '' **EAM is essential for the interaction between Cbl and PI3-K and , if so , whether this association is required for the 70Z/3-mediated NFAT activation , we mutated the methionine residue in this motif of 702/83 to cysteine ( Y**EAC ) .
A similar methionine mutation was found to disrupt the association of the CD28 YXXM motif with PI3-K ( 87 ) .
The relative specificity of this point mutation is indicated by the findings that : first , it did not have a global effect on the basal or anti-CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 702/83 , as revealed by anti-Tyr ( P ) immunoblotting of the corresponding immunoprecipitates ( Fig .
3C ) ; second , the mutation did not appear to have a gross effect on the integrity and/or conformation of the 702/83 protein since it could still associate in an activation-independ-ent manner with Grb2 ( Fig .
3D ) , which is known to constitutively associate with Cbl ( 5-8 ) .
Jurkat-TAg cells were transiently transfected with the 702/83 expression vectors ( or empty vector ) , and their association with endogenous PI3-K was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation using the anti-HA tag mAb .
The results ( Fig .
34 ) demonstrate that 70 % /3 coimmunoprecipitated with p85 in unstimulated cells , and that the amount of coprecipitated p85 was markedly increased following anti-CD3 stimulation .
The lower association in unstimulated cells most likely reflects the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl .
In contrast , very little association of Y '' *EAC with PIS-K was observed under the same conditions ( panel A ) , although the expression levels of the two Cbl proteins were equivalent as revealed by anti-HA immunoblotting ( Fig .
3B ) .
This result was confirmed by performing an in vitro PI3-K enzymatic assay on the same immunoprecipitates .
Thus , anti-HA immunoprecipitates from stimulated , Y '' **EAC-trans-fected cells contained a markedly lower PI3-K activity than their counterparts from 70 % /3-transfected cells ( Fig .
83K ) .
To-gether , these results suggest that the Y '' **EAM motif in 702/83 is largely responsible for the interaction with p85 .
Next , we determined the effect of the 702/83 Y '' *EAC mutation on the 70Z/3-mediated activation of NFAT .
The mutant plasmid or 702/83 was cotransfected with the NFAT-Lue reporter plasmid into Jurkat-TAg T cells .
As showed in Fig .

Mutation of the Y '' **EAM motif disrupts the association of 702/83 with PI3-K. Jurkat-TAg T cells were transfected with pEFneo , pEFneo-70 % /8 , or pEFneo-70Z/3/Y¥ '' `` EAC ( Y The cells were left unstimulated ( - ) , or stimulated ( + ) with an anti-CD3 antibody ( OKT3 ) .
The cells were then lysed and Cbl proteins were immu-noprecipitated with an anti-HA mAb .

A parallel membrane was immunoblotted with an anti-Tyr ( P ) mAb ( C ) , followed by reprobing with an anti-Grb2 mAb ( D ) .
The positions of molecular mass ( MW ) standards are indicated ( X 1000 ) .

times higher luciferase activity both in resting and ionomycin-stimulated cells than that from 702/3-transfected cells .
Similar results were consistently observed in a number of repeated experiments .
The expression levels of the transfected plasmids were determined by immunoblotting and no apparent difference was detected between 702/3 and Y '' **EAC ( Fig .
4B ) .
These data strongly suggest that an optimal interaction between PI3-K and 702/83 is not required for NFAT activity induced by the latter .
The Effects of C-terminal Deletions on 70Z % /3-mediated NFAT Activation-In order to further define the region in 702/83 which is responsible for NFAT activation , we focused on the C-terminal region of the protein , since v-Cbl , which corresponds to the 361 N-terminal residues of human c-Cbl , lacked any NFAT-stimulating activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
The C-terminal region of c-Cbl contains a proline-rich region and several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites ( 2 ) .

NFAT activation by 702/83 is independent of PIS-K asso-ciation .
A , Jurkat-TAg cells were transfected with NFAT-Lue plus pEFneo , pEFneo70Z/3 , or pEFneo/Y'**EAC ( Y *EAC ) .
The cells were left unstimulated or stimulated as indicated , and lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity .
Bars represent the mean of triplicate samples .
The data shown are representative of six experiments .
B , cell lysates were analyzed for the expression levels of the Chl proteins by immunoblotting with an anti-HA mAb .
70Z/3 proteins with successive C-terminal deletions were generated ( Fig .
5A ) and assessed for their ability to activate NFAT in Jurkat-TAg cells by transient cotransfection assays ( Fig .
5B ) .
As shown earlier ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) , 70 % /3 caused a ~3-fold increase in the basal NFAT activity and stimulated it by ~70-fold in the presence of ionomycin , whereas v-Cbl was inactive .
Similarly , mutation of the major PI3-K-binding motif ( Y¥ '' * '' EAC ) caused some increase in the corresponding activity .
Deletion of 114 or 176 C-terminal residues ( A1 and A2 , respec-tively ) reduced the activity by ~50 % relative to the untruncated 70 % /3 .
These results suggest that the C-terminal 114 amino acids of 702/38 contribute to maximal NFAT activation .
Surprisingly , the A3 construct , in which the 346 C-terminal 70Z/3 residues have been deleted , induced higher basal or ionomycin-stimulated NFAT activity than the untruncated 70Z/3 construct , and deletion of additional 20 ( A4 ) or 110 ( A5 ) residues essentially abolished this activity ( Fig .
5B ) .
The differences in biological activity among the distinct 702/83 constructs did not reflect differences in their expression levels since immunoblotting lysates of the transiently transfected cells with an anti-HA tag antibody revealed similar expression levels of the corresponding proteins ( Fig .
5C ) .
A Functional Ras Is Required for the 70Z/3 Function-The finding that 70Z2/3 synergizes with ionomycin to induce NFAT activation was reminiscent of the effect of constitutively active Ras which can also cooperate with ionomycin to induce NFAT or IL2 promoter activity ( 40-43 ) .
To examine whether NFAT activation by 702/38 is dependent on functional Ras , we cotransfected Jurkat-TAg cells with combinations of 70/3 and/or a dominant negative Ras expression vector ( or with the corresponding empty vectors ) , and assessed the degree of NFAT activation .

Effects of C-terminal deletions on the NFAT-inducing activity of 702/83 .
A , schematic illustration of the 70Z/3 constructs .
All the constructs contain an HA tag epitope at the N terminus ( star ) .
Shown are the 17-amino acid deletion occurring near the zinc Ring finger of c-Cbl which led to the generation of 702/83 , the 11 proline-rich stretches in the C-terminal region of human Cbl ( black bars ) , and the position of the Y '' **EAC point mutation ( asterisk ) .
The numbers of the last amino acid residue in each construct are indicated with respect to the original c-Cbl sequence .
The v-Cbl construct encoding the N-terminal 361 amino acids of c-Cbl is also shown .
B , Jurkat-TAg T cells were transiently cotransfected with an NFAT-luc reporter plasmid plus the indicated Cbl expression plasmids .
Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of ionomycin ( 100 ng/ml ) for the final 8-10 h of culture and then assayed for luciferase activity .

The expression level of 70 % /3 was , however , similar in cells cotransfected with the control ( pcDNA3 ) or RasN17 expression vector ( Fig .

These results suggest that functional Ras is required for the 70Z2/3-mediated activation of NFAT .
DISCUSSION In the present study , we have demonstrated that 702/3 , a mutated version of the Cbl protooncogene product , but not wild-type Cbl or v-Cbl , functions in a constitutively active manner to induce NFAT activation in Jurkat T cells and , furthermore , that 702/83 acts in synergy with calcium ionophore in this regard .

Induction of NFAT by 702/83 requires functional Ras .
A , Jurkat-TAg T cells were cotransfected with the NFAT-Luc reporter plasmid plus pEFneo or pEFneo-70Z/3 together with empty peDNA8 vector or pcDNAS-RasN17 .
Transfected cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with ionomycin , and lysed for the luciferase assay .
Bars represents the mean of triplicate samples .
The data shown are representative of three experiments .
B , samples of the same lysates were analyzed for 70Z/3 expression by immunoblotting with an anti-HA mAb .
A molecular weight ( MW ) standard is shown ( X 1000 ) .
both the basal and the ionomycin-stimulated induction of NFAT by 702/83 .
On the other hand , a mutation that markedly reduced the association of 702/83 with PI3-K did not impair the activation of NFAT and , in fact , seemed to increase it .
These results suggest that Cbl is involved in the TCR-CD3-mediated signaling pathway ( s ) which ultimately lead to the activation of NFAT , one of the critical transcription factor complexes involved in induction of IL2 and other cytokine genes ( 31 , 32 ) .
Optimal activation of NFAT and the IL2 promoter requires two signals which can be mimicked by agents that increase the free intracellular calcium concentration and activate the protein kinase C/Ras pathway in T cells , respectively ( 40-43 ) .
Constitutively active calcineurin , which can replace the calcium signal , or ionomycin , can each synergize with phorbol ester or constitutively active Ras to induce NFAT activation ( 41 , 42 ) .
Thus , calcineurin is a major target for the calcium signal involved in NFAT activation and IL2 gene transcription .
Our finding that 702/38 synergized with ionomycin ( but not with PMA ) to induce NFAT activation , and that this effect was blocked by cyclosporin A pretreatment ( Fig .
1 ) , strongly sug-gest , therefore , that this constitutively active Cbl can cooperate with calcineurin to provide the requisite signals for NFAT activation .
70Z2/3 mimicks in this respect the effects of constitutively active Ras ( 41 , 42 ) .
The similarity with Ras also extends to the finding that , like Ras ( 41 , 42 ) , 70 % /3 synergized with ionomycin ( Fig .
1 ) , but not with an anti-CD3 mAb ( data not shown ) , to activate NFAT .
This connection between Cbl and the Ras signaling pathway is supported by our finding that dominant negative Ras inhibited almost completely the 702/3-induced activation of NFAT , indicating that functional Ras is necessary for NFAT induction in the context of 702/38 .
This finding does not allow us to conclude at present whether Ras acts downstream of 702/83 , or in a parallel pathway which interacts with a Cbl-dependent pathway , to induce NFAT activation .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog Ras-dependent , Ca '' * -stimulated Activation of NFAT Recent studies have indicated that , in hematopoietic ( 5 , 6 , 17 ) and other ( 13 ) cells , tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl recruits PI3-K , an interaction that may be mediated by tyrosine-con-taining YXXM motifs in Cbl and the SH2 domain of p85 ( 17 ) .
Since PI3-K may be involved in signaling pathways leading to IL2 production ( 37 , 38 ) , it was of interest to examine whether PI3-K association with Cbl is required in order for 702/83 to activate NFAT .
We found that a point mutation of methionine to cysteine in the Y '' **EAM motif of 702/83 reduced the association of 702 % /3 with PI3-K to a minimum , indicating that this motif is largely responsible for the interaction of 702/83 with PI3-K .
However , this mutation increased the activation of NFAT by 702/83 , suggesting that activation-dependent recruitment of PI3-K to Chl is not required for the induction of NFAT .
A striking observation in the present study is that the 702/83 A3 mutant , from which 346 C-terminal amino acid residues were deleted , exhibited the highest NFAT-inducing transcriptional activity .
Further deletion of only 20 additional amino acid residues ( A4 ) completely abrogated basal or ionomycin-stimulated NFAT induction .
One potential explanation is that the region represented by residues 541-560 in 70 % /3 interacts directly or indirectly with an essential effector involved in NFAT activation , and that removal of more proximal residues ( i.e .
residues 561-906 ) facilitates this interaction , perhaps by abolishing other interactions with a negative regulator ( s ) .
Al-ternatively , differences in biological activity among the various constructs represent conformational changes in the structure of 702/38 , in which case A3 may have a more favorable conformation for mediating the effector function of Cbl .
Since the 70Z/3 deletions remove distinct proline-rich sequences which have been implicated in binding to SH3 domains of other proteins ( 5-8 , 44 ) , it is possible that interactions with SHS-containing signaling proteins are a major target for the functional effects of these deletions .
This possibility is currently being analyzed .
What is the molecular mechanism by which the constitutively active Cbl mutant , 702/83 , affects the transcriptional regulation of NFAT ?
The finding that 702/3 , but not wild-type Cbl , can mediate this event suggests that amino acid residues 366-383 ( which have been deleted in 702/83 ) regulate negatively the function of Cbl or its association with effector proteins , and that their removal unmasks the ability of Cbl to activate NFAT .
This is compatible with the findings that the same deletion activates the transforming potential of Cbl ( 4 ) .
The notion of a negative regulatory activity associated with Cbl is supported by the recent finding that a Cbl homologue , Sli-1 , negatively regulates vulval development in Caenorhabditis el-egans , a process which is known to be initiated by a homologue of the epidermal growth factor receptor via a tyrosine kinase-and Ras-dependent signaling pathway ( 45 ) .
The internal deletion may activate Cbl directly , or indirectly by abolishing an interaction between Chl and a putative negative regulator that binds to the deleted region .
It is possible that this activity can also be unmasked by an undefined physiological signal which leads to Cbl activation during T cell activation .
In any event , recent findings that Cbl functions as an adapter protein and associates with many signaling proteins suggest that Cbl-asso-ciated proteins may act as intermediate effectors to transduce signals from Chl which lead to induction of NFAT , and perhaps other transcriptional elements involved in T cell activation .
Our findings open the way for further studies to directly investigate the mechanism by which Cbl acts to regulate signaling pathways initiated by immune recognition receptors .
