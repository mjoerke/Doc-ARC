6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; Protein Kinase C Regulates Fas ( CD95/APO-1 ) Expression1 Ruoxiang Wang , Liying Zhang , Deling Yin , R. Allan Mufson '' , and Yufang Shi° Fas ( CD95/APO-1 ) is a transmembrane protein of the TNF/neuron growth factor receptor family .
Ligation of Fas by specific Abs or Fas ligand ( FasL/CD95 ligand ) induces rapid apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types .
Despite progress in understanding the death signals transduced from Fas , very little is known with regard to the mechanisms by which Fas expression is regulated .
Using our previously established murine T cell hybridoma model A1.1 , we show that specific protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitors could block activation-induced Fas expression and apoptosis .
The activation of PKC with PMA or l-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol could mimic the TCR signal by inducing the expression of Fas but not FasL .
PKC-dependent Fas expression was also observed in several murine and human tumor cell lines .
Since the inhibition of Ca** redistribution by an inhibitor of intracellular Ca** mobilization , 8- ( diethylamino ) -octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride , inhibited TCR-induced FasL but not Fas , the expression of Fas appears to be independent of Ca** mobilization .
Significantly , expression of the newly identified Fas-regulatory gene , TDAGS1I , was found to be dependent upon the activity of PKC .
PKC activation only induced Fas expression in cells expressing wild-type TDAGS1 .
Thus , Fas expression is likely mediated by PKC through TDAGS1 .
The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 2201-2207. ctivation of the TCR leads to the expression of a series A of genes related to either apoptosis or cell proliferation ( 1 , 2 ) .
Whether cell proliferation , differentiation , or apoptosis is favored depends upon the cellular stage and the extracellular milieu ( 2-4 ) .
The activation of immature T cells during thymic development induces apoptosis ( 5-7 ) .
Although TCR stimulation of resting peripheral T cells usually leads to proliferation and clonal expansion , primary activated mature T cells ( 8-10 ) and peripheral mature T cells from HIV-infected patients ( 11 ) are also sensitive to activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) .
* Thus , AICD in T cells is a fundamental mechanism for maintaining immune tolerance and cellular homeostasis during T cell development , immune responses , and disease ( 12 , 13 ) .
Similar to immature thymic lymphocytes and activated mature T cells , T cell hybridomas also undergo AICD following TCR cross-linking ( 14-17 ) .
Recent studies have demonstrated that AICD in T cell hybridomas is dependent upon the induction of Fas ( CD95 ) and Fas ligand ( FasL/CD95 ligand ) ( 18-20 ) .
Importantly , competitive inhibition of the interaction between Fas and FasL with soluble Fas proteins effectively inhibited AICD ( 19 ) .

Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists Fas and FasL play a fundamental role in AICD in T cells and T cell hybridomas .
The activation of Fas through its interaction with FasL or with specific anti-Fas Abs triggers the activation of a cascade of pro-teases ; these proteases , in turn , execute the apoptotic process ( 21 ) .
Interestingly , the apoptosis signals after Fas ligation are independent of macromolecular synthesis ( 22 ) .
Therefore , the expression of Fas is the key checkpoint for cells to commit to AICD .
In many cellular systems , the expression of Fas is strictly controlled ( 23 ) .
An overexpression of Fas rendered cells highly sensitive to FasL-mediated killing ( 24 , 25 ) .
However , the regulation of Fas expression is poorly understood .
Thus , elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms for Fas expression could provide important information for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis .
Ligation of the TCR by specific Ag peptide presented by the MHC on APCs initiates a biochemical cascade that involves the activation of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phos-phatases ( 1 , 2 ) .
These enzymes change the phosphorylation status of a number of intracellular substrates participating in the signal transduction cascade , which leads to the activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and to Ca** mobilization ( 13 ) .
Since PKC activation and Ca** redistribution have been shown to be critical in TCR-mediated activation signals , we examined the role of these signals in Fas and FasL expression during AICD .
An increase in cytosolic Ca** has been shown to be fundamental in the regulation of FasL expression , since the activation-induced expression of FasL could be completely inhibited by cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( 26 ) .
Nevertheless , the role of PKC in the regulation of Fas and FasL expression is not clear .
We report that the activation of PKC without intracellular Ca** mobilization is sufficient to induce Fas expression .
Interestingly , FasL expression requires both PKC activation and intracellular Ca '' * redistribution .

After washing with 0.2X SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 56°C for 1 h , hybridization signals were detected by autoradiography .
Results Both PKC activation and Ca '' * influx are required for AICD Murine T cell hybridoma A1.1 cells commit to AICD in a Fas- and FasL-dependent manner ( 15 , 19 ) .
AICD occurs in a period of 8 h , with a sequential induction of Fas at 2 h and FasL at 4 h following TCR cross-linking ( 19 ) .
Ligation of the TCR initiates a signal transduction cascade in which Ca** influx and the activation of PKC have been shown to be the critical points in activation-induced cytokine production and proliferation in T cells .
Thus , the combination of PMA and Ca** ionophore mimics the signals from the TCR ( 13 ) .
Here , we examined the role of PKC in the regulation of Fas and FasL expression during AICD .
We initially tested the requirement of PKC activation and Ca** influx for AICD in T cell hybridomas .
As shown in Figure 1 , treating A1.1 cells with the Ca** ionophere , ionomycin , plus either PMA or OAG readily induced apoptosis as detected by genomic DNA fragmentation ( Fig .
14 ) and MTT viability assay ( Fig .
1B ) .
When applied individually , neither ionomycin , PMA , nor OAG was sufficient to induce apoptosis .
Similar to the activation of primary T cells ( 30 ) , both PKC activation and Ca** influx are required for AICD in the A1l.1 hybridoma .
To further investigate the role of PKC in the pathway leading to AICD , we examined the effect of several relatively specific PKC inhibitors ( 31 ) .
We found that these inhibitors could effectively block TCR ligation-induced AICD in A1.1 hybridomas as demonstrated by DNA content analysis ( Fig .
1C ) and genomic DNA oligonucleosomal fragmentation ( Fig .
11 ) .
Furthermore , we have performed PKC isoform typing and found that a , y , 8 , e , 1 , and u were present in A1l.1 cells , while isoforms B , & , and 0 , were not found ( Fig .
1£ ) .
Thus , several PKC isoforms are present in T cell hybridoma A1l.l cells and are required for activation-induced apoptosis .
Activation of PKC alone sensitizes T cell hybridomas to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis The activation-induced expression of Fas and FasL is absolutely required for AICD in T cell hybridomas , since soluble Fas protein could completely block AICD ( 19 ) .
Unactivated A1.1 cells express a low level of Fas , which are insensitive to anti-Fas Ab- or FasL-expressing fibroblast-induced apoptosis ( Fig .
2 ) .
Interestingly , although the application of PMA or OAG alone could not induce apoptosis in A1.1 cells ( Fig .
1 ) , these treatments primed A1l.1 to undergo increased Fas ligation-induced apoptosis as detected by DNA content analysis ( Fig .
2 ) .
Specifically , Al.l1 cells were treated with PMA ( Fig .
24 ) or OAG ( Fig .
2B ) for 2 h and then incubated with L cells that had been transfected with either sense FasL or antisense FasL ( Fig .
24 ) or with or without anti-Fas ( JO2 , Fig .
2B ) for 12 h. PKC activation with PMA or OAG sensitized Al.1 cells to Fas ligation-induced apoptosis as assessed by DNA content analysis .
There are two possible explanations to account for this result , i.e. , PKC activation either increases Fas expression or sensitizes the T cell hybridoma cells to Fas-mediated death signals .

- Activation-induced apoptosis requires both PKC activation and Ca '' * .
A1.1 cells were activated with anti-CD3 or 25 nM of ionomycin with or without 50 nM of OAG or 30 nM PMA .
Genomic DNA fragmentation ( A ) and cell viability ( B ) were assessed at 12 h poststimulation .
A1.1 cells were activated with anti-CD3 with or without the PKC inhibitors ( HA and H7 , 50 uM ; G66976 , 1 uM ; bisindolyImaleimide , 10 M ; calphostin C , 50 nM ) for 8 h. Apoptosis was analyzed by DNA content analysis ( C ) and genomic DNA fragmentation ( D ) .
Different isoforms of PKC in A1.1 cells were determined by Western blot analysis .
The isoforms that were not present in A1.1 cells were underlined and not labeled on the gel ( E ) .
PMA alone induces Fas expression We have reported that AICD in T cell hybridomas requires de novo synthesis of macromolecules , since apoptosis could be suppressed by the inhibition of either protein or RNA synthesis ( 15 ) .
However , recent studies have shown that the apoptosis triggered by anti-Fas Ab is independent of macromolecular synthesis once the Fas receptor is expressed ( 22 ) .
Since treatment with phorbol esters sensitized cells to anti-Fas killing ( Fig .
2 ) , the effect of PKC activation might induce Fas expression .
Therefore , we characterized the phorbol ester induction of Fas expression .
A1.1 cells were treated with PMA in the presence or absence of ionomycin for 3 h , and RNA was isolated .
Electro-phoretically fractionated RNA was examined for Fas and FasL expression by Northern blot hybridization .
As shown in Figure 3A , the expression of Fas mRNA could be induced by phorbol ester alone , whereas the expression of FasL required both the activation of PKC and Ca** mobilization .
To further confirm the role of PKC activation in Fas expression , we treated A1l.1 cells with different concentrations of PMA ( 0.1 ng-1000 ng/m1 ) .
The maximal induction of Fas expression was observed at 5 ng/ml .
The expression level was comparable with the level induced by CD3 ligation ( Fig .
3B ) .
On the other hand , when the same blots were examined for the expression of FasL , we found that PMA alone does not have any effect on the induction of FasL .
PMA plus ionomycin or anti-€CD3 , however , induced the expression of FasL .
Experiments with OAG , which is a membrane permeable analogue of 1,2-diacylglycerol ( 32 ) , showed results that were similar to those obtained with PMA ( data not shown ) .

PKC activation primes T cell hybridomas to Fas-mediated apoptosis .
A1.1 cells were treated with PMA ( 30 nM ) or OAG ( 50 nM ) for 2 h and then cocultured with L cells that had been transfected with sense FasL ( FasL * ) or antisense FasL ( FasL- ) ( 4 ) or with anti-Fas ( JO , , 200 ng/m ! )
( B ) for 12 h. Apoptosis was assessed by cellular DNA content analysis .
Next , we isolated RNA from A1.1 cells that had been treated with PMA for different times ; we found that the PMA-induced Fas expression was detectable at 2 h posttreatment .
This increase was sustained for at least 12 h ( data not shown ) , while the Fas expression that was induced by anti-CD3 diminished at 5 to 6 h postactivation .
This sustained expression of Fas induced by PMA is compatible with the extended effect of PMA on PKC activation ( 33 , 34 ) .
To examine whether the activation of PKC alone could induce Fas in cell types outside the T cell lineage , we treated various cell lines with PMA for 3 h and analyzed Fas expression by Northern blot hybridization .
We found that PMA could induce Fas expression in a murine B cell lymphoma , CH31 , in a human breast cancer cell line , MDA231 , in a human ovarian cancer cell line , Hey , in a human cervical cancer , HeLa , and in a human prostate cancer , DU145 ( data not shown ) .
Since it has recently been shown that treating Jurkat cells with PMA increases their resistance to Fas ligation-induced apoptosis ( 34 ) , we have tested whether PMA also induces the expression of Fas in these cells .
As shown in Figure 3C , we found indeed that Jurkat cells were also induced to increase the expression of Fas .
Therefore , the effect of PMA on the sensitivity of Jurkat cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis is not exerted by regulating Fas expression ; rather the effect of PMA is exerted by interfering Fas signals .
Nevertheless , our results in A1l.1 cells are consistent with the recent observation of Wong et al .
( 35 ) , who have shown that PKC treatment increased the sensitivity of T cell hybridomas to Fas-mediated apoptosis ( the double-band pattern of human Fas has been shown previously ) .
Thus , PKC plays a general role in regulating Fas expression .
Expression of Fas is completely blocked by PKC inhibitors Although it has been well-established that the activation of T cells through the TCR activates both PKC and Ca '' * influx , our studies on the effect of activation of PKC with PMA do not necessarily establish a physiologic role for PKC during TCR signaling .
To confirm the role of PKC in activation-induced Fas expression through the TCR , we treated A1.1 cells with anti-CD3 in the presence or absence of the PKC inhibitor , H7 , or its analogue , HA1OOQ4 , for 3 h ; total RNA was isolated .
H-7 has a greater ability to inhibit PKC than cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase .
Con-versely , HA1OO4 has a greater ability to inhibit cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase than PKC ( 34 ) .
As shown in Figure 5 , Northern blot analysis revealed that H7 completely blocked activation-induced Fas expression , while HA1004 had no effect on TCR activation-induced Fas expression in A1l.1 cells .
Similar results were also obtained with the relatively specific PKC inhibitors calphostin C and G66983 ( data not shown ) .
Ca '' * is not required for Fas expression We have previously reported that blocking Ca* -dependent calcineurin with CsA completely inhibits AICD in T cell hybridomas .
As reported recently ( 26 ) , cyclosporin could inhibit activation-induced FasL but not Fas expression ( data not shown ) .
However , cyclosporin has no effect on the Fas expression induced by TCR ligation or PMA treatment ( data not shown ) .
Thus , calcineurin and downstream events , while important for FasL expression , are not required for Fas expression .
Since cyclosporin does not have any effect on cytosolic Ca* * levels and thus does not interfere with the interaction between PKC and Ca** , we tested the effect of an inhibitor of intracellular Ca** redistribution , TMB-8 ( 36 ) , on TCR cross-linking-induced AICD .
We found that TMB-8 completely blocked AICD ( Fig .
44 ) and FasL expression .
However , TMB-8 did not inhibit the activation-induced expression of Fas ( Fig .
4B ) .
Thus , activation-induced Fas expression is independent of the redistribution of intracellular Ca** .
Expression of Fas regulator TDAG351 is associated with Fas expression PKC signaling in T cells is a complex process involving multiple enzyme cascades .
Although our data clearly demonstrated 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology A Ionomycin+PMA | |_ Jer Ionomycin PMA FasL |u i | Fas ~~~ gump Gam ene B 2 % I , % z & 2 3 - m # wa Z © 3 § s S 3 a & & : f 8 4 Gg G G G G G 5 6 ° E Z Z £ £ Z Z 2 V < 4 Cn Fa Aa Pia Pa C C Fas ~ » ap os wo u20De © TTD FasL .

Activation of PKC alone induces Fas expression .
A , A1.1 cells were activated with PMA ( 20 nM ) or PMA plus ionomycin ( 25 nM ) for 3 h. The expression of Fas and FasL was determined by Northern blot .
B , Al.1 cells were activated with anti-CD3 or different concentrations of PMA for 3 h. Similarly , Fas and FasL expression was examined by Northern blot .
C , Jurkat cells were activated with PMA .
The expression of Fas was accessed by Northern blot using human Fas cDNA as a probe .
a vital role for PKC in AICD , the PKC downstream effectors have not yet been elucidated .
It has recently been reported that TDAGS51 , a newly identified potential transcription factor , is required for activation-induced Fas expression in T cell hybridomas ( 17 ) .
Thus , we determined the relationship between PKC and TDAGS51 in our system .
When the expression of TDAGS51 was analyzed in A1l.1 cells , we found that this gene is not expressed in unactivated A1l.1 cells .
However , its expression is induced upon activation through the TCR or by PMA alone .
Similar to Fas , the expression of TDAGS1 also has a requirement for PKC ( Fig .
5A ) .
In addition , we examined the expression of Fas in another T cell hybridoma , KCIT , and its mutant bearing the mutation of TDAGS1 .
We found that PMA induced Fas expression in KCIT cells , but not in the TDAGS1 mutant .
Interestingly , transfecting the mutant with wild-type TGAGS1 restored its response to PMA-induced Fas expression ( Fig .
5B ) .
Therefore , TDAGS1 is a downstream effector in the PKC-mediated pathway leading to the induction of Fas expression .

Cell viability was determined by MTT assay at 12 h postactivation ( A ) .
Fas and FasL expression was determined by Northern blot at 3 h postactivation ( B ) .
Discussion It is clear that the expression of Fas and FasL is responsible for apoptosis in some cell types , not only for the elimination of activated T cells after mounting a proper immune response ( 12 , 37 ) but also for the maintenance of immune-privileged sites ( 38 , 39 ) .
AICD in T cells requires de novo macromolecular synthesis , including the up-regulation of Fas and FasL , whose interaction then activates the apoptosis program ( 19-21 ) .
Since it has been shown that Fas ligation-induced apoptosis is independent of macromole-cule synthesis ( 22 ) , the activation of Fas and FasL genes is a critical step in initiating AICD .
It has been well-established in T cell hybridomas that the expression of Fas and FasL increases after activation ( 19 , 17 ) .
Furthermore , blocking the interaction of Fas and FasL with Fas fusion proteins could completely block AICD ( 19 ) .
Alternatively , T cells can be activated by calcium ionophere and phorbol ester .
This combination implies that both calcium redistribution and the translocation of PKC are required for T cell activation ( 30 ) .
Since the signals leading to the expression of Fas still remain largely unknown , we investigated the role of Ca** and PKC in the regulation of Fas expression .
Our data show that Fas expression is solely dependent upon PKC activation and does not require Ca* * redistribution .
This effect of PKC is exerted through TDAGS1 .
PKC-mediated Fas expression was also observed in the murine B cell lymphoma CH31 and in several human cancer cell 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 2206 Ionomycin PMA + Ionomycin Anti-CD3 + H7 2 z t ' Anti-CD3 + HA Anti-CD3 PMA Control TDAGS1 Fas | » « » ~ > with s= quem Garon | & » an a a o an am KCIT TDAGS1-~/-KCIT TDAGS1-/-Transfected TDAGS1 KCIT PMA - t =- f : -~ + Fas wﬁw GAPDH FIGURE 5 .

Therefore , PKC activation may be a critical component in the regulation of Fas expression .
Recent studies have demonstrated that FasL expression could be inhibited by CsA ( 26 ) , retinoic acid ( 40 ) , antioxidants ( 41 ) , and dexamethasone ( 42 ) .
In accordance with our previous results on the requirement of c-myc during AICD , we have recently shown that the inhibition of c-myc expression also inhibits FasL expression ( 43 ) .
Interestingly , none of the FasL modulatory reagents had any effect on the expression of Fas , indicating that the expression of Fas and FasL are regulated by distinct pathways .
We activated A1.1 cells with anti-CD3 Ab-coated plastic in cal-cium-free medium supplemented with different concentrations of calcium and assayed DNA fragmentation at 12 h poststimulation .
We found that the extent of DNA fragmentation was dependent upon the calcium concentration in the medium ( data not shown ) .
Similar results were obtained by supplementing with different concentrations of EGTA .
Thus , these experiments clearly demonstrated that extracellular Ca** is essential for AICD in the T cell hybridoma .
It has been shown that the blocking of the Ca** signal by CsA could completely inhibit FasL , but not Fas , expression .
However , it is not known whether Ca** alone is sufficient in FasL induction .
We have found that blocking intracellular Ca** with TMB-8 completely inhibited FasL expression but did not affect Fas .
We have performed experiments in which Al.1 cells were PKC MEDIATES Fas EXPRESSION treated with 2000 nM of PMA for 12 h. We found that this treatment blocked activation-induced apoptosis in these cells ( data not shown ) .
Although this treatment blocked activation-induced FasL expression , it did not show effects on Fas expression .
Since the Ca** PKC isoforms are more sensitive to PMA depletion , we conclude that activation-induced Fas expression does not require Ca* * based on these findings and the above data combined with our observation that PMA alone could induce maximal Fas expression .
Thus , our data strongly suggest that FasL expression requires both PKC and Ca** .
We have shown that the diacylglycerol analogue OAG , which stimulates PKC , induces apoptosis in A1l.1 cells when added together with ionomycin .
Further , we have shown that the inhibition of PKC could prevent activation and inhibit anti-CD3-induced Fas expression and apoptosis in the T cell hybridoma .
This observation indicates that PKC is involved in activation-induced Fas expression .
When we down-regulated PKC function by preincubating cells with high concentrations of PMA , we were able to show again that activation-induced Fas expression required PKC ( data not shown ) .
TDAGS1 is a newly identified potential transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of activation-induced Fas expression in the T hybridoma KMIs-8.3.5 .
This hybridoma undergoes Fas/ FasL-dependent apoptosis upon activation .
A variant of KMIs-8.3.5 bearing a mutation in TDAGS1 expresses FasL , TNFR-1 , and IL-2 , but not Fas ( 17 ) .
Transfection of the active gene restored activation-induced Fas expression in this mutant .
Thus , TDAGS1 may play an essential role in the induction of apoptosis by coupling TCR stimulation to Fas expression .
Our data show that TDAGS1 expression could also be activated solely by PKC ; it is very likely that the effect of TDAGS1 acts downstream of PKC .
How TDAGS1 regulates Fas expression is currently not known .
The transfection of TDAGS1 does not appear to induce Fas expression ( 17 ) .
Thus , it is possible that other factors are required .
Studies are in progress to determine how PKC regulates TDAGS1 and Fas expression .
