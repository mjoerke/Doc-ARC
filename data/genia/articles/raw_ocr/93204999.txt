4 Interaction Between NF- « B- and Serum Response Factor-Binding Elements Activates an Interleukin-2 Receptor « -Chain Enhancer Specifically in T Lymphocytes ANNA A. KUANG , t KRISTINE D. NOVAK , # SANG-MO KANG , § KEVIN BRUHN , AND MICHAEL J. LENARDO* Laboratory of Immunology , Room 11D09 , Building 10 , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 Received 6 November 1992/Returned for modification 18 December 1992/Accepted 6 January 1993 We find that a short enhancer element containing the NF- « B binding site from the interleukin-2 receptor « -chain gene ( IL-2Ra « ) is preferentially activated in T cells .
The IL-2Ra enhancer binds NF- « B poorly and is only weakly activated by the NF-B site alone .
Serum response factor ( SRF ) binds to a site adjacent to the NF-B site in the IL-2R enhancer , and both sites together have strong transcriptional activity specifically in T cells .
Surprisingly , the levels of SRF constitutively expressed in T cells are consistently higher than in other cell types .
Overexpression of SRF in B cells causes the IL-2R enhancer to function as well as it does in T cells , suggesting that the high level of SRF binding in T cells is functionally important .
The a-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-Z2Ra ) is a key surface protein that is expressed during the activation of T lymphocytes .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) is a major regulator of T-cell proliferation and death ( 23 , 53 , 54 ) .
The IL-Z2Ra protein is a component of the high-affinity receptor for IL-2 ( 62 ) .
The IL-2 receptor is expressed early in mouse T-cell differentiation on CD4~ CD8~ thymocytes , in which it may play a role in the expansion of thymocyte number ( 58 ) .
The IL-2Ra « protein , and presumably its gene , are turned off at later stages of thymic development .
In mature T cells , the IL-2Ra « gene can be reexpressed following antigen stimulation .
This is a tightly regulated process-resting T lymphocytes express virtually no IL-Z2Ra « , whereas antigen-acti-vated T cells have surface expression of 3 x 10° to 6 x 10* IL-2Ra molecules ( 62 ) .
The IL-2Ra gene is most commonly expressed in T cells but can be expressed also in other hematopoietic cells ( 62 ) .
During antigen activation of mature T cells , the promoter of the IL-2Ra gene is regulated by a DNA sequence that binds the NF- « B protein complex ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 27 , 44 ) .
NF- « B is a protein complex that enables a large number of genes to be rapidly induced in response to extracellular stimuli ( 16 , 24 ) .
Two polypeptides , termed p50 and p65 , together form the NF- « B transcriptional transactivator by specifically binding to a 10-nucleotide DNA sequence ( 2 , 50 ) .
The recent cloning of the subunits of NF- « B reveals that they belong to the Rel family of DNA-binding protein genes , which includes p50 , p49/p50B ( lyt-10 ) , p65 , c-re/ , RelB , and v-rel ( 6 , 7 , 12 , 21 , 34 , 35 , 45 , 49 , 50 , 63 ) .
Mature B cells express high constitutive levels of NF- « B ( p50/p6S5 het-erodimer ) binding activity in the nucleus ( 50 ) .
Most other cells contain NF- « B in a non-DNA-binding form in the cytoplasm complexed with an inhibitory protein called I- « B * Corresponding author .

2536 that prevents both nuclear translocation and DNA binding ( 2 ) .
-B belongs to a family of proteins sharing a conserved protein motif known as the ankyrin repeat ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 17 ) .
NF- « B can be released from IB and become active in the nucleus of T cells following stimulation of the antigen receptor with antigen or surrogate stimuli ( 19 , 20 , 50 ) .
Within the lymphoid lineage , it is largely unknown what additional molecular determinants cause specific genes to respond to NF-kB and related activators in T cells versus B cells .
We studied the NF- « B sites in the immunoglobulin « gene ( x ) and the IL-2Ra gene ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 26 , 27 , 44 , 51 ) .
Several studies have demonstrated that NF- « B and c-re/ can bind to and presumably transactivate the IL-2R B site ( 3 , 4 , 8 , 27 , 44 , 57 ) .
We previously showed that the kB site from the IL-2Ra promoter caused greater transcriptional activity in T cells compared with that in B cells ( 8 ) .
We now show that preferential activity in T cells is facilitated by an adjacent site in the IL-ZRa « oligonucleotide that binds the serum response factor ( SRF ) .
SRF mediates both growth factor induction of the c-fos gene and muscle actin gene regulation ( 13 , 14 , 32 , 36 , 41 , 42 , 46 , 60 ) .
Growth factor or protein kinase C induction of the c-fos gene apparently may not alter the levels of SRF binding but possibly alters a constitutively bound SRF complex with its DNA binding site , the serum response element ( SRE ) or causes additional protein interactions ( 14 , 15 , 18 , 43 , 46 , 56 ) .
We present evidence that elevated levels of SRF binding activity in T-lymphoid cells are important for regulating an SRE-like sequence in the IL-2Ra « gene .
Moreover , the SRF- and NF- « B-binding elements together cause preferential expression of the IL-2R enhancer element in T cells .

activity was carried out as described by Pierce et al .
( 39 , 40 ) .
$ 194 and P3X63AG8 were transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure .
MT-2 and ELA cells were transfected by electro-poration with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus with each sample containing 5 x 10° cells per assay in 0.25 ml of RPMI plus 20 % FCS .
Samples were electroporated at 200 V and 960 uF capacitance , incubated on ice for 10 min , replated at 10° cells per ml of RPMI plus 10 % FCS ( stimulated EL-4 plus 50 ng of PMA per ml ) , and incubated at 37°C and 5 % CO ; .
Samples were normalized according to protein content .
Thin-layer chromatographic plates were counted in a Molecular Dynamics Phospho Imager .
The percent acetylation was calculated by dividing the sum of the acetylated and diace-tylated values by the total of each sample .
Plasmid constructions .
CAT reporter plasmids were derived from the A56-c-fos CAT plasmid ( 13 ) or the pBLCAT2 plasmid ( 30 ) .
Note that the A5S6-c-fos CAT backbone is truncated so as to eliminate most known factor binding sites , including the SRE , leaving only the TATA motif and transcription start site .
Synthetic oligonucleotides with sequences shown in Fig .
1 were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems , Inc. , model 380B DNA synthesizer and were kinased , annealed , and cloned into the unique Sa/Zl sites in either A56-c-fos CAT or PBLCAT2 , as carried out previously ( 26 , 40 ) .
Not depicted in the sequences in Fig .
1 are 5'-TCGA-3 ' extensions on both strands that allow cloning into restriction sites ( SaZl , Xhol , etc . )
that are compatible .
To create an SRF expression plasmid , a plasmid containing the human SRF cDNA was obtained from R. Treisman ( 36 ) and was digested with EcoRI .
The 3.5-kb SRF cDNA IL-2R « GENE REGULATION 2537 fragment was filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I ( Boehringer-Mannheim ) .
The plasmid pBK28 obtained from I. Verma ( 48 ) contains a FBJ-murine sarcoma virus ( MSV ) long terminal repeat , a simian virus 40 poly ( A ) addition site , and an ampicillin resistance gene .
pBK28 was digested with Xhol and EcoRI , yielding a 3.8-kb fragment that was filled in with Klenow , treated with alkaline phos-phatase from calf intestine ( Boehringer-Mannheim ) , and then ligated to the 3.5-kb SRF cDNA fragment .
The EcoRI SRF fragment was also cloned directly into the pMT2T adenovirus major late promoter expression plasmid ( 20 ) .
Procedures were carried according to manufacturer 's instructions or standard techniques ( 47 ) .
The constructions were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping .
Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis .
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al .
( 10 ) with modifications that we described previously ( 25 ) .
Binding assays were either carried out as described previously ( 25 ) or modified to run on custom-made minigel apparatuses ( Owl Scientific Co. ) .
The modified reaction was in 6- to 10-pl total volume set up in the wells of a Terasaki plate ( Nunc Intermed ) and contained 2 to 5 ug of nuclear extract protein , 0.5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) unless otherwise noted , and 40,000 cpm ( Cerenkov ) of radiolabelled target DNA in a solution of 10 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM EDTA , and 10 % glycerol .
The samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and loaded with a tapered micropipette tip into the wells of the minigel apparatus .
For competitions , the indicated amounts of unlabelled oligonucleotides were added to the binding mix , with the nuclear extract protein added last .
For supershift assays , the nuclear extract was preincubated for 15 min on ice with either preimmune serum or anti-SRF antiserum ( RP-4 , a gift of R. Prywes ) against a C-terminal peptide of SRF .
Electrophoresis was carried out on 4 % polyacrylamide gels ( 30:1 ) in 50 mM Tris , 380 mM glycine , 2 mM EDTA ( pH 8.5 [ 55 ] ) or 6.7 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 7.5 ) , 3.3 mM sodium acetate , and 1 mM EDTA ( 26 ) with recirculation of the buffer at a voltage of 11 V/cm for 90 min at room temperature .
IxB inhibition experiments were carried out by preincubating nuclear extracts with bacterially expressed IB ( a gift of A. Baldwin ) for 15 min on ice .
Flow cytometry analysis .
Aliquots of 5 x 10° cells were washed and suspended in sorter buffer containing 1x PBS ( 0.8 mM potassium phosphate , 154 mM sodium chloride , 2.9 mM sodium phosphate [ pH 7.4 ] ) with 2.5 % FCS and 0.1 % sodium azide .
Cells were stained with either a 1:50 dilution of monoclonal antibody rat immunoglobulin M 7D4 against the mouse IL-2Ra « chain ( 31 ) or mouse immunoglobulin G2a anti-Tac against the human IL-2Ra chain ( 61 ) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-rat k or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G2a ( Southern Biotechnol-ogy ) , respectively .
Samples of 10 '' events were analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACSCAN cytometer with Consort-30 software .
RESULTS Functional differences in « B binding oligonucleotides .
Previously it was found that a 22-base oligonucleotide bearing the immunoglobulin x light chain gene NF- « B binding site ( x ) acts as a enhancer in both B and T lymphocytes , whereas a 26-base NF- « B site oligonucleotide from the IL-2Ra gene promoter functioned preferentially in T cells ( 8 , 40 ) .
To confirm this difference , we prepared new test constructs with single copies of both NF-KB oligonucleotides as en- 2538 KUANG ET AL .

Variations in the CAT values between experiments were usually less than 20 % ; results for the different constructs are representative of 10 experiments in $ 194 , MT-2 , and EL-4 cell lines and 2 experiments in the P3X63Ag8 cell line .
Assays of oligonucleotides in either the A56-fos-CAT or pBLCAT2 backbones gave similar results ( data not shown ) .

We found that the immunoglobulin x oligonucleotide ( x ) was more active than the IL-2R oligonucleotide in the mouse B-cell lines P3X63¥AG8 and $ 194 ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , in MT-2 human T-leukemia cells or in PMA-stimulated EL-4 mouse T-lymphoma cells , the activity of the IL-2R oligonucleotide was on average sixfold greater than that of the x oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2 ) .
The c oligonucleotide worked well in both T cells and B cells .
By contrast , the IL-2R oligonucleotide was very active in T cells but worked poorly in B cells .
These differences were sur-prising , because each of the cell lines tested had significant levels of NF- « B binding activity ( see Fig .

was independent of the orientation of the oligonucleotides and was seen when CAT was driven by a minimal thymidine kinase promoter instead of the c-fos promoter ( data not shown ) .

The ILT oligonucleotide binds a specific complex that is indistinguishable from SRF .
Autoradiogram of an EMSA with 4 ug of nuclear extract per lane from H9 human T-lymphoma cells ( lanes 1 to 5 , 10 , 12 , and 15 ) or SRF produced from an in vitro transcrip-tion-translation reaction with an SRF coding sequence plasmid ( a gift of R. Treisman ) ( lanes 6 to 10 , 13 , 14 , and 16 ) .
Only the slowest migrating complex is specific by competition analysis .
ILT or SRE was used as probes as indicated .
Note that the same apparent complex is detected with either the SRE or the ILT probe which comigrates with the in vitro translation product .
Supershift assays were carried out by preincubating 1 pl of either preimmune serum ( lanes 11 and 13 ) or anti-SRF serum ( lanes 12 and 14 ) .
$ 194 B cells had very little p55 .
Unstimulated EL-4 cells had a moderate level of surface p55 that was elevated by PMA stimulation .
MT -2 cells had very high levels of p55 .
Therefore , the activity of the IL-2R enhancer oligonucleotide reflects appropriate tissue-specific expression of the IL-2R gene in these cell lines .
IL-2R contains a weak NF-B binding site .
Because the exact nucleotide sequence of the NF-kB binding motifs differed between the immunoglobulin k gene and IL-2R ( Fig .
1 ) , their abilities to bind NF- « B were tested .
In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) the IL-2R and the immunoglobulin x oligonucleotide were used to compete for the formation of the NF- « B complex with either oligonucleotide with an MT-2 extract ( Fig .
4 ) .
The IL-2R sequence was able to compete five times better for the NF- « B complex formed with itself as probe than with the immunoglobulin k sequence as a probe ( lanes 1 to 8 ) .
The immunoglobulin k sequence was also able to compete five times better for the NF- « B complex formed with the IL-2R sequence as a probe than with the immunoglobulin « sequence as probe ( lanes 9 to 16 ) .
Thus , for either probe , the IL-2R oligonucleotide did not compete as effectively as the immunoglobulin k sequence , which is consistent with previous analyses ( 16 ) .
These findings suggest that the IL-2R sequence was a significantly weaker binding site for NF- « B than the immunoglobulin k sequence , which seemed to explain why the IL-2R oligonucleotide was transcriptionally less active in B cells than the immunoglobulin x oligonucleotide .
The downstream flanking sequence of the NF-KB site is important for IL-2R enhancer activity .
In our previous study , we found that when the downstream flanking sequence of the NF-KB site in the IL-2R oligonucleotide was appended to the immunoglobulin xB site , its activity was enhanced specifically in T cells ( 8 ) .
We therefore tested the IL-2R KB site without its downstream flanking sequence ( sIL-2R ) , and found it worked significantly worse in T cells than the IL-2R oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2 ) .
This was true despite the fact that 2540 KUANG ET AL .

Tissue specificity of the SRF-ILT nucleoprotein complex .
EMSAs contained the radiolabelled ILT oligonucleotide defined in the legend to Fig .
1 , 5 ug of protein , and 0.5 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) from nuclear extracts from the cell lines indicated above each lane .
The protein concentrations in all nuclear extracts were carefully quantitated in a single assay with the Bio-Rad kit just prior to EMSA analysis .
Lanes 2 to 4 , B-cell lines ; lanes 5 to 12 , T-cell lines ; lanes 1 and 13 to 16 , nonlymphoid cell lines .
The arrow indicates the specific SRF complex as determined by competition assays .
The lower band is nonspecific by competition analysis ( see Fig .
5 and 8 ) , is characteristic of human cell nuclear extracts ( lanes 7 to 15 ) , and is detected by several other unrelated probes ( 23a ) ( see Fig .
8 ) , suggesting that it is a nonspecific binding protein .
The derivation of the cells is provided in Table 1. both the IL-2R and sIL-2R oligonucleotides bound NF- « B equivalently ( data not shown ) .
Notably , removal of the downstream flanking sequence of the IL-2R « B site or mutations in it ( see below and Fig .
7 ) did not activate the IL-2R « B site in B cells and was therefore unlikely to contain a site for repression in B cells .
Together , these results suggest that the IL-2R downstream flanking sequence ( Fig .
1 ) contained a site that was positively regulated in T cells and might account for why the IL-2R oligonucleotide is more active than the immunoglobulin « oligonucleotide in T cells .
SRF binds adjacent to NF-B .
Because of the apparent functional importance of the sequence downstream of the NF- « B site in the IL-2R oligonucleotide in T cells , this sequence , termed ILT ( Fig .
1 ) , was tested for binding to nuclear factors .
An EMSA revealed several nucleoprotein complexes with the ILT sequence with extracts from H9 human T cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
The slowest migrating complex bound specifically , since wild-type ( ILT , lanes 1 to 3 ) but not mutant ILT ( M-ILT , lanes 4 and 5 ) sequences could inhibit its formation .
The faster migrating complexes were not specifically inhibited .
Sequences within the ILT oligonucleotide resembled a motif called CArG , [ CC ( A/T ) , GG ] , which binds a nuclear regulatory protein known as SRF ( 15 , 32 , 33 , 36 , 41 , 42 , 60 ) .
Others have previously noted similarities between a protein complex with the IL-2R promoter and SRF ( 3 , 38 , 59 ) .
We therefore compared the ILT complex with SRF by binding to a CArG box-containing oligonucleotide derived from Xenopus y-actin gene sequences ( SRE , a gift of R. Prywes ) .
The SRE oligonucleotide detected a comigrating complex in H9 extracts .
Either oligonucleotide could also cross-complete for binding of the other ( data not shown ) .
Also , SRF produced by in vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA coding sequence formed a complex with either the ILT or the SRE probes that comigrated with the specific ILT complex ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 to 10 , 15 , and 16 ) .

Finally , antiserum against SRF ( a gift of R. Prywes ) but not preimmune serum specifically shifted both the ILT and SRF complexes ( Fig .
5 , lanes 11 to 14 ) .
Note that the band above SRF in lanes 11 and 14 is an artifact resulting from a component of the preimmune serum interacting directly with the DNA probe .
Similar competition and supershift analyses were obtained by comparing Jurkat and HeLa nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the ILT complex appears to be indistinguishable from SRF .
SRF binding is present at higher levels on T cells .
We next determined the abundance of SRF in various continuously cycling tumor cell lines .
Surprisingly , we found that T-cell lines consistently exhibited high levels of nuclear SRF binding activity ( Fig .
6 , lanes 5 to 12 ; Table 1 ) .
By contrast , B cells or nonlymphoid cells , with some exceptions , had lower levels of nuclear SRF binding activity ( Fig .

IL-2R transcriptional activation levels are reduced by mutations in either the xB or SRE sequences .
Quantitation of CAT assays from transfections of various cell lines with reporter constructs containing either the IL-2R oligonucleotide or derivatives with mutations in the NF-kB site ( M1 ) , the CArG box ( M3 and M5 ) , or both sites ( M2 ) ( for sequences , see Fig .
1 ) .
Thin-layer chromatography plates were counted in a Molecular Dynamics Phosphor Imager and are presented as histograms indicating the relative CAT activity above that of vector alone , which was assigned a value of 1 .
Values are the average of two independent transfections in this experiment .
Variations between experiments were less than 20 % in CAT values ; results are representative of four experiments .
human cells ( lanes 7 to 15 ) but not mouse extracts have a strong shifted band that migrates faster than SRF , but this band is not specific for the CArG box ( see legend to Fig .
6 ) .
The distribution of SRF contrasted with the distribution of nuclear NF- « B which was constitutively present in mature B cells but present in other cells only after induction by stimuli such as by p40'** , PMA , phytohemagglutinin , or cyclohex-imide ( Table 1 ) .
Binding of SRF was not affected by these stimuli ( Table 1 ) .
IL-2R activity depends on B and CArG sequences .
We next tested whether elevated levels of SRF in T cells could stimulate the IL-2R oligonucleotide either alone or in conjunction with weak binding of NF- « B .
Mutations were introduced into the IL-2R oligonucleotide that destroy binding to either the NF- « B site ( M1 ) , the CArG box ( M3 and MS ) , or both sites ( M2 ) ( for sequences , see Fig .
1 ) .
Mutations in either site drastically reduced the activity of the IL-2R oligonucleotide in MT-2 cells or in stimulated EL-4 cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
Altering the KB site alone or both the kB and SRE sites abolished activity , while eliminating the SRE site reduced activity to the level seen with the sIL-2R oligonucleotide ( compare Fig .
7 with Fig .
2 ) .
Because MT-2 cells have unusually high levels of NF-KB in the nucleus , sIL-2R ( Fig .
2 ) and the M3 and MS oligonucleotides retain approximately 20 % of the activity of the IL-2R oligonucleotide ( Fig .
7 ) .
Importantly , the ILT oligonucleotide , which contains the downstream flanking sequencing alone , had only variable or low enhancer activity that could not account for the activity of the IL-2R oligonucleotide in T cells ( Fig .
7 , ILT ) .
The combined enhancer activity of the « B and SRE sites in the complete IL-2R oligonucleotide appeared to be greater than the contribution of either site alone .
NF- « B and SRF bind simultaneously to IL-2R .
We next tested by EMSA whether NF- « B and SRF could bind simultaneously with the IL-2R oligonucleotide ( Fig .
8 ) .
This revealed the formation of four complexes with either MT-2 ( Fig .
8A , lanes 1 to 14 ) or EL-4 plus PMA ( lanes 15 to 24 ) nuclear extracts .
For either extract , competition with the IL-2R oligonucleotide itself diminished binding of the three complexes of slowest mobility ( labeled 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , indicating these were specific ( Fig .
8A , lanes 1 to 4 and 15 to 18 , and for EL-4 , seen more clearly in Fig .
8B , lanes 1 to 4 ) .
The most rapidly migrating complex is the nonspecific band previously seen in human extracts ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) .
Complex 2 was not inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing a mutant CArG box ( Fig .
8A , M3 , lanes 8 to 10 ) or an irrelevant oligonucleotide ( Fig .
8A , X , lanes 11 to 13 ) , suggesting it was the SRF complex .
Complex 3 was not inhibited by a mutant NF- « B site ( Fig .
8A , M1 , lanes 5 to 7 ) or an irrelevant oligonucleotide ( Fig .
8A , X , lanes 11 to 13 ) , suggesting it was NF- « B .
The identification of NF- « B and SRF was supported by comparison to complexes obtained with known « B and SRE probes from other genes ( data not shown ) .
Interest-ingly , complex 1 could be inhibited by either mutant oligonucleotide but not by the irrelevant oligonucleotide ( X ) , suggesting that it represented the binding of both SRF and NF- « B .
The abundance of complex 1 was less than the individual NF- « B and SRF complexes , suggesting there was not significant cooperativity in binding in vitro .
Antibody supershift studies confirmed that complexes 1 and 2 contained SRF ( Fig .
8B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Conversely , complexes 1 and 3 , but not SRF , could be inhibited with IxB , suggesting they both contain NF- « B or a related complex ( Fig .
8C , lanes 1 to 3 , 8 , and 9 ) .
Moreover , oligonucleotide containing the immunoglobulin « B site or the Xeropus y-actin SRE site could inhibit complex 1 as well as NF- « B and SRF , respectively ( Fig .
8C , lanes 3 to 7 ) .
Thus , despite the close proximity of their binding sites , a ternary complex of an 2542 KUANG ET AL .

The IL-2R oligonucleotide binds NF-kB , SRF , and both proteins together .
( A ) EMSA with radiolabelled IL-2R oligonucleotide as a probe .
A total of 5 ug of MT-2 nuclear extract per lane was added in lanes 1 to 14 , 5 pg of nuclear extracts from EL-4 cells stimulated with 50 ng of PMA per ml for 3 h was added to each of lanes 15 to 26 .
Unlabelled oligonucleotide competitors are IL-2R ( lanes 1 to 4 and 15 to 18 ) , IL-2Rm1 ( lanes 5 to 7 and 19 to 21 ) , IL-2Rm3 ( lanes 8 to 10 and 22 to 24 ) , and X , which is a 26-bp oligonucleotide of random sequence { lanes 11 to 14 ) .
Arrow 1 points to the specific complex containing both the SRF and NF-xB complexed with the IL-2R oligonucleotide .
Arrow 2 indicates the SRF complex alone , and arrow 3 indicates the NF-kB complex alone .
( B ) EMSA showing competition as in lanes 15 to 18 of panel A .
Lanes 5 and 6 are samples with no competitor , and for lane 6 , the nuclear extract was preincubated with anti-SRF antiserum as described in the legend for Fig .
5 .
EMSA was carried out in low-ionic-strength Tris-acetate buffer ( 20 ) .
( C ) EMSA with either the IL-2R probe ( lanes 1 to 7 ) or the ILT probe ( lanes 8 and 9 ) in which the nuclear extract was untreated ( lane 3 ) or treated with the indicated volumes ( in microliters ) of I-kB ( lanes 1 , 2 , and 9 ) .
Competitions used either the immunoglobulin « B oligonucleotide ( lanes 4 and 5 ) or the Xenopus actin SRE ( lanes 6 and 7 ) in the nanogram amounts shown .
NF- « B-like protein complex , SRF , and DNA could be demonstrated in vitro .
Overexpression of SRF drives IL-2R in B cells .
These experiments suggest that SRF- and NF- « B-binding sites collaborate to positively activate the IL-2R enhancer in T cells .
The lower constitutive levels of SRF binding in B cells might therefore be rate limiting for IL-2R enhancer expression .
This would differ from growth factor regulation in which the level of SRF binding activity appears not to be rate limiting during serum activation of the c-fos gene ( 13 , 18 , 46 ) .
To test this idea , we overexpressed SRF in B cells by constructing a chimeric gene in which the SRF coding sequence was expressed by a FBJ-MSV retroviral promoter ( 48 ) .
This chimeric gene ( BKSRF ) was transfected in increasing amounts together with the IL-2R enhancer/reporter plasmid into $ 194 B cells which have little SRF binding activity ( Fig .
6 ) .
The retroviral promoter plasmid without SRF coding sequences ( BK ) was added to maintain a constant amount of DNA in the transfection .
As shown previously , the IL-2R enhancer alone had little activity in $ 194 cells ( Fig .
9 ) .
However , IL-2R enhancer activity was increased 3- and 8.5-fold by the addition of 5 and 10 ug , respectively , of BKSRF ( Fig .
9 ) .
Overexpression of SRF had either variable or no effect on the immunoglobulin k oligonucleotide ( x ) or the CAT backbone ( A56 ) ( Fig .
9 ) .
Overexpression of SRF gave quantitatively no induction of IL-2R expression in EL-4 cells or the M3 mutant oligonucleotide in $ 194 cells .
In further experiments , 10 pug of a plasmid overexpressing SRF in the sense orientation by the adenovirus major late promoter increased IL-ZR expression threefold in $ 194 cells , whereas the antisense orientation had no effect .
In EL-4 cells , expression of the sense or antisense orientation of SRF gave almost the same CAT activity as the backbone alone ( 23a ) .
These results suggest that levels of SRF can be rate limiting for transcriptional activation and support the conclusion that elevated SRF in T cells contributes to the increased activity of the IL-2R element .
DISCUSSION Our investigation was prompted by the intriguing question of how NF- « B and other members of the Rel family , induced in many cell types in response to diverse signals , activate only certain genes in specific hematopoietic lineages .
Our previous study of an NF- « B site in the IL-ZRa « promoter suggested that the site had selective activity in T lymphocytes ( 8 ) .
We have now further dissected this element and found that its preferential activity in T cells is due to the interaction of NF-kB and SRF binding sites .
Surprisingly , we found SRF binding activity to be consistently higher in T-lymphoid tumor lines than in other continuously cycling tumor cells .
The combined action of NF-kB and SRF appeared to be due to the formation of a complex including both factors and the IL-2R oligonucleotide .
Finally , overexpression of SRF in a B-cell line activated the IL-2R enhancer oligonucleotide .
This suggests that the level of SRF in the cell , and not other posttranslational effects , is rate limiting for IL-2R enhancer activation in T cells .
One plausible explanation for the functional differences between the immunoglobulin x and IL-2R elements in B cells and T cells is that different members of the Rel gene family or other DNA-binding proteins ( 1 ) specifically regulate these sites .
Several aspects of our data are incompatible with this hypothesis : ( i ) the sIL-2R oligonucleotide had much less Vor .

SRF overexpression activates transcription of the IL-2R enhancer in $ 194 B cells .
Above is shown the chimeric gene construction used to overexpress SRF coding sequence by a strong viral promoter/enhancer from the FBJ-MSV long terminal repeat ( a gift of I. Verma ) .
In the middle is shown the thin-layer chromatographic analysis of CAT activity from the transfected cells .
Cells were transfected with 10 ug of CAT reporter construct together with the indicated amounts of SRF expression vector BKSRF ( in micro-grams as shown ) .
The total amount of expression vector was kept constant by addition of BK~ ( vector without the SRF cDNA ) .
The reporter constructs were either the A56 backbone ( A56 ) , the IL-2R-fos-CAT construct ( IL-2R ) , or the < -fos-CAT construct ( kappa ) .
Below are given the amounts of DNA used and quantitation of the relative acetylation of chloramphenicol relative to the A56 backbone value .
Absolute percent conversion for the samples ( from left to right ) were A56 , 0.18 , 0.11 , and 0.13 ; IL-2R ( run in a separate assay in which A56 and J14 gave 0.7 to 12 % acetylation , respectively ) , 0.6 , 2.9 , and 5.2 ; and kappa , 0.76 , 0.49 , and 0.69 .
Variations in the CAT values between experiments were less than 20 % ; results are representative of four experiments .
activity than the IL-2R oligonucleotide in T cells despite the fact that they competed equivalently for NF- « B ( data not shown ) , ( ii ) mutations in the CArG box dramatically decreased the activity of the IL-2R oligonucleotide , and ( iii ) SRF overexpression increased the activity of the IL-2R but not the x oligonucleotide in B cells .
Each of these pieces of evidence points toward a functional importance of the downstream flanking sequence of the IL-Z2R oligonucleotide , which contains the SRF binding site .
Another possibility is that a repressor acts at the SRE sequence in B cells , but we have failed to find evidence that this sequence can repress positive elements in B cells ( data not shown ) and when removed or mutated does not increase sIL-2R activity in B cells ( Fig .
2 and 7 ) .
We therefore favor the hypothesis that both B and T cells have a Rel protein complex , probably NF- « B , that will activate the IL-ZR site but only in cooperation with SRF .
Though we did not detect cooperativity in binding in vitro , one model is that in vivo , SRF is capable of recruiting NF-kB to its adjacent binding site .
The importance of this mechanism for the regulation of the IL-2Ra IL-2Re GENE REGULATION 2543 gene is supported by previous studies in which mutations in the sequences that bind SRF severely impair IL-2Ra promoter function in T cells ( 3 , 59 ) .
However , these previous studies do not address the contribution of SRF to T-cell specificity in the IL-2R gene , because the promoter mutants and levels of binding activity were not examined in non-T cells .
We now show that SRF contributes importantly to T-cell specificity of the IL-2R enhancer .
Recent evidence suggests that c-re/ also activates the IL-2R B site and thus contributes to its activity in T cells ( 57 ) .
It will be interesting to determine if SRF can interact directly with any member of the Rel protein family .
Our studies revealed a surprising facet of the biology of SRF .
Previously , SRF has been associated with gene induction by serum and growth factors and muscle-specific gene expression .
We now propose that SRF can be used by T cells for tissue-specific gene activation .
In particular , IL-2Ra « gene control may differ with regulation of the c-fos gene by serum or growth factors ( 18 , 46 , 52 , 56 ) .
Importantly , the SRF-p62 interaction , which may take part in c-fos regula-tion , is mediated through DNA sequences that flank the CArG box in the c-fos promoter .
These sequences are absent from the flanks of the CArG box in the IL-Z2Ra « promoter .
Recently , a coactivator molecule has been identified in HeLa cells that stimulates transcription by SRF ( 64 ) .
Such coacti-vators may further regulate the transcriptional response to SRF in different cell types .
Together , these findings suggest that there are multiple pathways of gene regulation through SRF .
Regulation of IL-2Ra « in mature T cells depends on antigen stimulation .
However , IL-2R « expression during thymic development occurs in a transient stage before T-cell receptor genes are rearranged and expressed .
This would seem to preclude any involvement of antigen-receptor signalling in inducing IL-2Ra « early in T-cell development .
Recently we have found that SRF binding activity is abundant early in thymocyte development at the double-negative stage ( 65 ) .
It will be interesting to determine whether NF- « B and SRF participate in this earlier , presumably antigen-independent , expression of IL-Z2Ra « during T-lymphocyte ontogeny .
