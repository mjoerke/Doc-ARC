Interleukin ( IL ) -10 Inhibits Nuclear Factor « B ( NFB ) Activation in Human Monocytes IL-10 AND IL-4 SUPPRESS CYTOKINE SYNTHESIS BY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS* ( Received for publication , January 12 , 1995 , and in revised form , February 22 , 1995 ) Peng Wang , Ping Wu , Marvin I. Siegel , Robert W. Egan , and M. Motasim Billah From the Schering-Plough Research Institute , Kenilworth , New Jersey 07038 Our previous studies in human monocytes have demonstrated that interleukin ( IL ) -10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated production of inflammatory cytokines , IL-1 $ , IL-6 , IL-8 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - « by blocking gene transcription .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) , we now show that , in monocytes stimulated with LPS or TNFa , IL-10 inhibits nuclear localization of nuclear factor « B ( NFxB ) , a transcription factor involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes .
Several other transcription factors including NF-IL-6 , AP-1 , AP-2 , GR , CREB , Oct-1 , and Sp-1 are not affected by IL-10 .
This selective inhibition by IL-10 of NFB activation occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner and correlates well with IL-10 's cytokine synthesis inhibitory activity in terms of both kinetics and dose responsiveness .
Furthermore , compounds such as tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate that are known to selectively inhibit NFB activation block cytokine gene transcription in LPS-stimulated monocytes .
Taken together , these results suggest that inhibition of NFB activation may be an important mechanism for IL-10 supression of cytokine gene transcription in human monocytes .
IL-4 , another cytokine that inhibits cytokine mRNA accumulation in monocytes , shows little inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NFKB activation .
Further examination reveals that , unlike IL-10 , IL-4 enhances mRNA degradation and does not suppress cytokine gene transcription .
These data indicate that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit cytokine production by different mechanisms .
Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , * originally identified as a cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor , inhibits production of a wide range of cytokines in various cell types ( for review , see Ref .
1 ) .
For instance , IL-10 suppresses synthesis of IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - « in monocytes/macrophages ( 2-6 ) , of IL-1 , IL-8 , and TNFa in neutrophils ( 5 ) , and of IL-2 , TNF $ , interferon-y , granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulat-ing factor , and others in T cells ( 7 ) .
This inhibition of cytokine production is accompanied by reduced accumulation of mRNAs ( 2-6 ) .
Nuclear run-on experiments in human monocytes have demonstrated that IL-10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

induced synthesis of IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNFa by acting mainly at the level of gene transcription ( 5 , 6 ) , raising the possibility of IL-10 affecting the activities of transcription factors involved in cytokine gene expression .
Gene promoters for IL-1 $ , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNFa contain multiple cis-acting motifs including those that bind such transcription factors as nuclear factor « B ( NFkB ) , NF-IL-6 , AP-1 , AP-2 , CREB , GR , Oct-1 , and Sp-1 ( 8-11 ) .
Motifs for NFB , NF-IL-6 , AP-1 , AP-2 , and CREB are common to all four cytokine gene promoters , and recent data have clearly indicated that NFB , NF-IL-6 , and AP-1 are critical for the induction of these cytokine genes ( 8 , 12-21 ) .
NFkB was originally identified as a heterodimeric complex consisting of two subunits , p65 and p50 ( reviewed in Ref .
22 ) .
In most cells including monocytes , NFB is constitutively present in the cytoplasm as an inactive p65-p50-I « B ternary com-plex .
Various stimuli including LPS induce rapid dissociation of the inhibitory subunit IxB .
The resultant heterodimer of p50 and p65 translocates into the nucleus and initiates transcription of appropriate genes in synergy with other transcription factors such as NF-IL-6 .
Like NFkB , NF-IL-6 exists in the cytosol and responds to stimulation by rapidly translocating into the nucleus ( 23 ) .
By contrast , c-Fos and c-Jun , the two components of AP-1 , are synthesized de novo during stimulation ( 24 ) .
Our present data suggest that IL-10 causes selective inhibition of NFB activation in LPS-stimulated human monocytes , and that this NFxB inhibition may be a mechanism by which IL-10 causes the suppression of the cytokine production .
Our data further demonstrate that IL-4 inhibits cytokine production by a mechanism that does not involve NFkB .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Preparation and Incubation-Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were prepared as described ( 5 ) .
For some experiments , purified monocytes were prepared from PBMC by elutriation ( 25 ) .
The elutriated monocyte fraction consisted of > 95 % monocytes as determined by histologic staining and by immunofluorescence assay for CD14 antigen .
Cell incubation was performed as described previously ( 5 ) .
Assays for Cytokine Proteins-Cytokines released into cell culture media were determined by using commercially available specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits ( IL-6 and TNFa kits from Bio-source , Camarillo , CA ; IL-18 and IL-8 kits from R & D Systems , Minne-apolis , MN ) .
The assays were performed in duplicate .
The data presented are from representative experiments .
Data points are the means of two determinations , which were within 10 % , mostly 5 % , of the mean .
Northern Blot Analysis-Cytokine mRNA levels in cells after various treatments were determined by Northern blotting as described previously ( 6 ) .
Cytokine cDNA probes were from R & D Systems .
Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -At the end of the specified incubation time , cells ( 15-20 x 10° per sample ) were collected by centrifuging at 350 x g for 5 min at 4 °C .
After washing once with phosphate-buffered saline , the cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A ( 10 mm Hepes-NaOH , pH 7.8 , 15 mM KCl , 2 mm MgCl , , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mx dithiothreitol , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .

Effect of IL-10 on LPS- and TNFa « -induced NFB activation in human PBMC .
A , the nuclear protein sample from LPS-stimulated cells ( see below ) was used to examine the specificity of the complex observed by EMSA using a P-labeled NFxB oligonucleotide probe as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Competition experiments were performed using unlabeled NFxB and Oct-1 oligonucleotide probes at 100 % molar excess .
In `` supershift '' experiments , antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 ug per assay .
B , cells were stimulated with 80 ng/ml LPS or 20 ng/ml TNFa in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml IL-10 for 1.5 h before the extraction of nuclear protein for EMSA .
microcentrifuge tube then centrifuged at 750 x g for 5 min .
The supernatant was removed by aspiration , and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer A .
After 10 min on ice , Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.5 % and the suspension was centrifuged at 1330 x g for 15 min .
The resultant nuclear pellet was suspended in 15 pl of buffer B ( 20 mm Hepes-NaOH , pH 7.9 , 1.5 mm MgCl , , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.42 M NaCl , 0.2 mm EDTA , 25 % glycerol , and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
After 15 min on ice with vigorous stirring , the suspension was centrifuged at 16,300 x g for 10 min .
Fifteen ul of the resultant supernatant was diluted with 75 ul of buffer C ( 20 mm Hepes-NaOH , pH 7.9 , 50 mm KCl , 0.2 mm EDTA , 0.5 mi dithiothreitol , and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ] fluoride ) to obtain the final nuclear extract prep-aration .
EMSAs for NFxB and other transcription factors in nuclei were performed by using gel shift assay system ( Promega ) , except that 8 % ( instead of 4 % ) gels were used .
The reaction mixture contained 2 ul of 5 x gel shift binding buffer , 1 ul of *°P-labeled consensus oligonucleotide ( oligo ) probe of appropriate specificity , 2 ul of water , and 5 ul of nuclear extract ( 1 ug of protein ) .
Nuclear Run-on Assay-Cytokine gene transcription rates were measured by nuclear run-on assays as described previously ( 6 ) .
mRNA Stability Analysis-Cytokine mRNA stability was analyzed as described previously ( 6 ) .
Other Reagents-Human recombinant IL-10 and IL-4 were from Schering-Plough .
Human recombinant TNFa was obtained from R & D Systems .
LPS , TPCK , TLCK , and PDTC were purchased from Sigma .
Consensus oligonucleotide probes for various transcription factors , except for NF-IL-6 were from Promega .
The probe for NF-IL-6 was synthesized as reported ( 26 ) .
Antibodies against p65 and p50 subunits of NFkB were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Phosphorothicate analogs of NFB oligonucleotides , both sense and antisense , were prepared as reported ( 13 ) .
RESULTS IL-10 Selectively Inhibits NFkB Activation-In order to determine the effects of IL-10 treatment on transcription factors involved in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines , nuclear extracts were prepared from appropriately treated PBMC , and EMSA was performed using specific °°P-labeled cis-acting DNA elements .
Thus , when nuclear extracts from LPS-treated cells were incubated with a °°P-labeled NFkB oligonucleotide probe , a °°P-labeled protein-oligonucleotide complex was formed ( Fig .
14 ) .
This complex formation was inhibited in the presence of an excess of unlabeled NFKB oligonucleotide , but not in the presence of an excess of unlabeled Oct-1 oligonucleotide , showing that the NFxB oligonucleotide specifically competes with °°P-labeled probe .
Furthermore , specific antibodies to the NFB components p50 and p65 caused a supershift of the P-labeled complex , confirming the identity of the protein in the complex as NFB ( Fig .
1 ) .
Hence , the °°P-labeled oligonucleotide probe used in these experiments complexed with cellular NFkB and LPS stimulated NFkB translocation into the nucleus .
The data that anti-p50 antibody 9559 caused the total shift of the °°P-oligonucleotide-NFxB complex while anti-p65 antibody caused only a partial shift show that LPS-stimulated nuclear NFkB exists as both p50-p50 homodimer and p50-p65 heterodimer , with the homodimer predominating .
Incubation of PBMC with IL-10 alone for up to 1.5 h had no effect on nuclear NFB .
However , when IL-10 was added 5 min before LPS , NFkB translocation induced by LPS was completely inhibited ( Fig .
1B ) .
Under the same conditions , production of IL-6 and IL-8 was also inhibited ( data not shown ) .
Stimulation of PBMC with a different stimulus , TNFa , caused nuclear localization of NFxB , but to a smaller degree than LPS .
TNFa-induced NFB translocation ( and cytokine synthesis under the same experimental conditions ) was inhibited by IL-10 treatment .
Thus , IL-10 inhibits NFB activation in PBMC in response to two distinct stimulating agents .
When incubated with °°P-labeled NF-IL-6 cis-acting ele-ment , nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated PBMC generated a *P -labeled protein-oligonucleotide complex , which was competed away with unlabeled NF-IL-6 oligonucleotide but not with unlabeled Oct-1 or NFkB oligonucleotide .
This complex formation was not affected by IL-10 treatment .
LPS-stimulated localization of AP-1 into the nucleus , when assessed under similar conditions , was also not inhibited by IL-10 .
When incubated with the °°P-labeled cis-acting elements for AP-2 , CREB , GR , Oct-1 , and Sp-1 , nuclear extracts from resting cells produced the appropriate °°P-labeled protein-oligonucleotide complexes .
None of these complexes was affected by either LPS or IL-10 ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that IL-10 causes selective inhibition of NFkB activation in LPS-stimulated PBMC .
Characteristics of IL-10 Inhibition of NFkB Activation-The inhibitory effects of IL-10 on NFkB activation and cytokine synthesis were dependent on IL-10 concentration ( Fig .
2 ) .
Nearly complete inhibition of both NFkB translocation and cytokine synthesis occurred at 1-10 ng/ml IL-10 .
However , substantial NFxB activity was still detected at 0.1 ng/ml IL-10 , a concentration that inhibited TNFa and IL-18 synthesis ( 60 75 % inhibition ) more effectively than it did IL-6 and IL-8 synthesis ( 20-35 % inhibition ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
This differential inhibition pattern suggests that the threshold levels of NFkB necessary for the initiation of cytokine gene expression vary among different cytokines and confirms our previous conclusion that cytokine gene expression is differentially regulated in LPS-stimulated monocytes ( 6 ) .
This experiment was performed using a PBMC-derived preparation that contained > 95 % monocytes .
The lymphocyte fraction obtained from the same PBMC preparation produced neither cytokines nor NFkB translocation .
Thus , cytokine production and NFB activation and their inhibition by IL-10 in LPS-stimulated PBMC were due primarily to monocytes and not to lymphocytes , although the lymphocytes accounted for 80 % of the PBMC population .
In experiments discussed above where a complete inhibition of NFB activation was observed , IL-10 was added 5 min before LPS .
The same complete inhibition was noted when IL-10 was added simultaneously with or 2 h before LPS , suggesting that IL-10 acts rapidly to inhibit NFxB activity and that the sig-nal ( s ) generated by IL-10 lasts for at least 2 h ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similar rapid inhibitions have also been observed with both cytokine protein synthesis and cytokine gene expression ( 6 ) , demonstrating a strong correlation between cytokine gene expression and NFkB activation .
In addition , the nuclear appearance of NFxB in response to LPS preceded cytokine mRNA accumula-tion , and nuclear NFB activity reached a maximum within 30 min of LPS addition and remained virtually unchanged over the next 2.5 h ( data not shown ) .

Effects of IL-10 concentrations on LPS-induced NFB activation and cytokine release in human monocytes .
A , various concentrations of IL-10 were added 5 min before the addition of 80 ng/ml LPS .
After 1.5 h , nuclear protein was extracted and EMSA was performed as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
B , an aliquot of cell suspension from each of the culture samples used for EMSA was further incubated for a total period of 4 h. Cytokines released to the supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
The amounts of IL-18 , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNFa produced by LPS stimulation in the absence of IL-10 were 2.4 , 17.0 , 120.6 , and 3.1 ng/ml , respectively .

Effect of IL-10 addition time on inhibition of LPS-induced NFB activation in human PBMC .
IL-10 ( 10 ng/ml ) was added 2 h prior to , 0 , 0.5 , or 1 h after LPS ( 80 ng/ml ) .
Cells were exposed to LPS for a total period of 1.5 h. For all other details , see `` Materials and Methods . ''
1 h after LPS during an LPS stimulation period of 1.5 h , substantial inhibition of NFkB activity was still observed and was more pronounced at 0.5 h than at 1 h ( Fig .
3 ) .
This observation supports the view that nuclear NFkB undergoes rapid turnover during LPS stimulation ( 27 ) .
Inhibition of NFkB May Be Sufficient for Suppressed Synthesis of Inflammatory Cytokines-To determine whether inhibition of NFkB activation is sufficient for suppression of cytokine production , two non-peptide inhibitors of NFxB activation were investigated for their ability to inhibit cytokine mRNA synthesis .
TPCK , a chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibi-tor , is a potent inhibitor of NFxB activation ( 28 ) .
In our system , TPCK inhibited LPS-induced NFxB activation as well as the accumulation of IL-1 $ , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNFa mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner , and , at 20 pun , both responses were IL-10 Inhibits NFB Activation in Human Monocytes completely inhibited ( Fig .
4 ) .
TLCK , an analog of TPCK with inhibitory activity against trypsin-like serine proteases ( 28 ) , inhibited neither NFkB activation ( data not shown ) nor cytokine mRNA accumulation in LPS-stimulated PBMC ( Fig .
4 ) .
In LPS-stimulated human monocytes , it has been published that the antioxidant , PDTC , inhibits NFxB activation ( 29 , 30 ) and TNFa synthesis ( 30 ) in a dose-dependent manner .
In our experiments , PDTC by itself caused slight accumulation of cytokine mRNAs , but a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced accumulation of various cytokine mRNAs was still observed ( Fig .
4 ) .
Given the relative specificity with which these two compounds ( TPCK in particular ) inhibit NFkB among various transcription factors tested ( 28 , 29 ) , our present data are consistent with NFkB inhibition being responsible for the inhibition of cytokine mRNA accumulation .
An antisense oligonucleotide to the p65 subunit of NFkB inhibits IL-8 production in Jurkat T lymphocytes ( 13 ) .
We have also examined the effect of this antisense oligonucleotide on the production of IL-1 3 , IL-6 , and TNFa by LPS-stimulated PBMC .
Preincubation of cells with the antisense oligonucleotide for 4-8 h resulted in an inhibition of cytokine synthesis by 50 % to 70 % , probably due to insufficient uptake of the oligonucleotide .
Upon longer preincubations , the oligonucleotide itself induced cytokine synthesis .
Taken together , these data suggest that inhibition of NFB activation may be sufficient for suppression of the synthesis of various inflammatory cytokines .
IL-4 Does Not Inhibit NFB Activation-The effect of IL-10 on LPS-induced NFxB activation was compared with that of IL-4 , because IL-4 is a potent inhibitor of cytokine synthesis in human monocytes ( 5 ) .
Under the present experimental conditions , maximal IL-4 inhibition of LPS-induced synthesis of the cytokines was 80 % ( IL-1 $ , IL-6 , and IL-8 ) or 70 % ( TNFa ) .
The steady state levels of cytokine mRNAs , as determined by Northern blot analysis , were also similarly inhibited .
However , at 10 ng/ml , that was optimal for its inhibitory effects on cytokine synthesis , IL-4 caused no significant suppression of the NFB activation ( Fig .
5 ) , suggesting that the inhibition of cytokine synthesis by IL-4 does not involve NFB .
Nuclear run-on experiments revealed no inhibition by IL-4 of transcription of cytokine genes in LPS-stimulated monocytes ( Fig .
6 ) , while mRNA stability analysis showed that IL-4 treatment did enhance the degradation of various cytokine mRNAs ( Fig .
7 ) .
These results are consistent with IL-4 not inhibiting NFxB activation and indicate that IL-4 and IL-10 inhibit cytokine synthesis in LPS-stimulated human monocytes through distinct mechanisms .
DISCUSSION We have previously shown in human monocytes that IL-10 inhibits cytokine mRNA accumulation by acting at the level of gene transcription ( 6 ) , indicating a possible mechanism of IL-10 action through transcription factors .
Several approaches using mutation or deletion of kB sequence , overexpression of NFkB proteins , antisense oligonucleotides to NFkB , and the NFkB DNA binding sequence have provided data to strongly implicate NFkB in the expression of cytokine genes in monocytes ( 8 , 12-14 , 31 , 32 ) .
Additional studies have further suggested that NFxB acts synergistically with NF-IL-6 and AP-1 to effect cytokine gene expression ( 17 , 19 ) .
In the present study , we demonstrate that IL-10 inhibits NFxB activation in stimulated human monocytes without affecting AP-1 , NF-IL-6 , or other transcription factors that are believed to be involved in cytokine gene transcription .
This selective inhibition of NFkB activation occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner and correlates well with the inhibition of cytokine gene transcription in terms of both time course and dose-response , indicating that IL-10 inhibition of cytokine gene expression may be me IL-10 Inhibits NFB Activation in Human Monocytes Fic .

diated by the blockade of NFxB activation .
Although treatment of cells with TPCK and PDTC may elicit broader effects than inhibition of NFB only , it is noteworthy that these compounds do not affect other transcription factors such as AP-1 , Oct-1 , CREB , and Sp-1 ( 28 , 29 ) and that a structural analog of TPCK is without effect on NFB activation or on cytokine mRNA accumulation ( Fig .
4 ) .
This selectivity with regard to NFB inhibition and the inhibition of cytokine mRNA accumulation by TPCK and PDTC in conjunction with the observations that antisense oligonucleotides and the NFkB binding sequence inhibit cytokine mRNA synthesis would indicate that the blockade of NFkB activation might indeed be 9561 Le a a 3 $ % $ 4 '' `` s s Lws ou Gy G 200 a o ¥M++¥+UU++ kow ono & & Z 2 BF d _id _ mm l 2d a oa a 6 11 ; a a % 3 .

Our data , however , do not rule out the possibility that IL-10 exerts its inhibitory action on cytokine gene transcription through other transcription factors .
While transcription factors such as AP-1 , NF-IL-6 , Oct-1 , Sp-1 , and CREB are not affected by IL-10 , IL-10 does cause a rapid nuclear localization of the transcription factor , p91 , a component of the protein complex which binds to the interferon-y response region ( 33 ) .
However , the importance of this complex in cytokine gene transcription has yet to be determined .
Recently , it has been reported that in LPS-stimulated macrophages from mice lacking the p50 subunit of NFkB , TNFa and IL-1a « release are normal ( 34 ) , suggesting NFxB-independent regulation of the cytokine genes .
However , it remains unclear whether the in vivo role of p50 in cytokine gene regulation can be compensated for by other members of the NFkB family ( e.g .
p65 ) .
A definitive assessment of the role of NFxB in gene expression of inflammatory cytokines must await evaluation of animals with targeted disruption of both p50 and p65 .
The fact that IL-4 inhibits cytokine synthesis and cytokine mRNA accumulation by enhancing cytokine mRNA degradation suggests the existence in human monocytes of a transcription factor-independent mechanism .
This mechanism is not stimulated by IL-10 in human monocytes , as suggested by our observation that IL-10 has little or no effect on cytokine mRNA stability .
Interestingly , in murine peritoneal ( 35 ) and porcine alveolar ( 36 ) macrophages , IL-4 inhibits cytokine gene transcription with little or no effect on mRNA stability , whereas , in these same systems , IL-10 appears to act by enhancing mRNA degradation ( 4 ) .
These observations suggest that IL-4 and IL-10 generate distinct signals affecting distinct steps in cytokine mRNA metabolism and that the mechanisms employed by these two inhibitory cytokines vary depending on the animal species .
IL-10 action on NFxB most likely involves the blockade of a reaction required for release of IxB from the NFB complex in intact cells .
Experiments using cell-free preparations have suggested that protein kinases such as protein kinase C phospho-rylate IxB causing its release and ensuing activation of NFxB 9562 IL-10 Inhibits NFB Activation in Human Monocytes 120 Tip IL-1B bese « - & 40 { Fic .
