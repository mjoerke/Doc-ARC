The Small GTP-Binding Protein Rho Potentiates AP-1 Transcription in T Cells JIN-HONG CHANG , JOANNE C. PRATT , SANSANA SAWASDIKOSOL , ROSANA KAPELLER , Anp STEVEN J. BURAKOFF* Division of Pediatric Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , and Department of Pediatrics , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Received 1 December 1997/Returned for modification 30 December 1997/Accepted 29 May 1998 The Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure , gene transcription , specific cell fate development , and transformation .
We demonstrate in this report that overexpression of an activated form of Rho enhances AP-1 activity in Jurkat T cells in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , but activated Rho ( V14Rho ) has little or no effect on NFAT , Oct-1 , and NF-KB enhancer element activities under similar conditions .
Overexpression of a V14Rho construct incapable of membrane localization ( CAAX deleted ) abolishes PMA-induced AP-1 transcriptional activation .
The effect of Rho on AP-1 is independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , as a dominant-negative MEK and a MEK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) did not affect Rho-induced AP-1 activity .
V14Rho binds strongly to protein kinase Ca ( PKCa ) in vivo ; however , deletion of the CAAX site on V14Rho severely diminished this association .
Evidence for a role for PKCa as an effector of Rho was obtained by the observation that coexpression of the N-terminal domain of PKCa blocked the effects of activated Rho plus PMA on AP-1 transcriptional activity .
These data suggest that Rho potentiates AP-1 transcription during T-cell activation .
The Ras-related Rho family members are involved in thymic development , cell transformation , actin cytoskeletal rearrange-ment , and cell polarity ( 17 , 26 , 35 , 36 , 41 , 47 ) .
The Rho family is comprised of several related proteins , including Racl , RacZ , RhoA , RhoB , RhoC , Cde42Hs , and TC1O ( 18 , 19 ) , which share structural similarity with Ras .
These proteins contain intrinsic GTPase activity and bind GTP and GDP in a manner that is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs ) , and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) ( 43 , 46 ) .
Several GEFs for the Rho family , such as Ost ( 23 ) , Tiam ( 29 ) , and the faciogenital dysplasia gene product ( FGD1 [ 39 ] ) , have been isolated and shown to promote binding of GTP to Rho .
Ber ( 11 ) , p190 ( 8 , 45 ) , and Cdc42GAP ( 7 ) have been demonstrated to act as GAPs for the Rho family , promoting the conversion of GTP to GDP .
The importance of Rho family members in cellular activation and growth has been underscored by several recent stud-ies .
In NIH 3T3 cells , coexpression of oncogenic Ras ( 61L ) with activated Rho ( 63L ) enhances morphological transformation and cell motility .
Overexpression of dominant-negative ( DN ) mutants of Rac or Rho reduces oncogenic Ras transforming activity , indicating that activation of Rho is required for Ras transformation ( 26 , 40 ) .
Roles for Rho in gene regulation and cell cycle progression have also been demonstrated .
Microinjection of activated forms of Rho , Rac , and Cdc42Hs stimulates cell cycle progression and subsequent DNA synthe-sis .
Serum-induced DNA synthesis and progression through the G , phase can be blocked by microinjection of C3 exoenzyme ( a specific inhibitor of Rho ) or by expression of DN Rac or Cdc42Hs ( 38 ) .
In addition , thymuses lacking functional Rho isolated from transgenic mice that overexpress C3 exoenzyme are small and show markedly decreased cellularity ( 17 ) .

4986 studies have demonstrated that Rho is required for survival of early pre-T cells and regulates cell cycle progression in late pre-T cells ( 20 ) .
The mechanism ( s ) by which Rho regulates such diverse cellular processes is not well understood .
One possibility is that Rho mediates distinct cellular functions through control of transcriptional activation .
Consistent with this hypothesis , reports have demonstrated that activated Rho regulates c-fos promoter activity by serum response factor ( SRF ) and that this activity can be blocked by the addition of C3 exoenzyme ( 1 , 21 ) .
Fos interacts with c-Jun and subsequently controls the transcriptional activation of a number of other genes involved in many cell programs .
Protein kinase C ( PKC ) consists of a family of structurally related serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in cell proliferation , differentiation , and transformation ( 32 , 33 ) .
PKCs are divided into three major subgroups ( conventional , novel , and atypical ) defined by their structures and their abilities to be regulated by calcium and/or phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) .
Conventional PKCs contain a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain that is composed of a pseudosubstrate site , a C1 domain that binds diacylglyc-erol ( DAG ) or its analog PMA , and a C2 domain that binds calcium and phospholipid .
The cellular roles of the different PKC isozymes remain unclear , but accumulated evidence has shown that individual PKC isoforms may play distinct roles in response to various activating stimuli .
For example , overexpression of PKC enhances the growth rate of NIH 3T3 cells , while overexpression of PKC8 decreases cell growth rate ( 31 ) .
The important role of PKCs in signal transduction is evident from their substrate specificity , subcellular localization , sensitivity to downregulation via agonist induction and regulation of cell growth and differentiation ( 33 ) .
Interaction of the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) with antigen in the context of major histocompatibility complex proteins initiates a signal transduction cascade that leads to transcriptional activation , lymphokine production , cell proliferation , and induction of the cell 's effector function .
In addition to the TCR , other costimulatory surface molecules , such as CD28 , Vou .
18 , 1998 contribute to T-cell signaling ( 14 ) .
T-cell activation via anti-TCR and anti-CD28 antibody-mediated costimulation markedly enhances the production of several cytokines , including interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-3 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( 51 ) , and also results in cellular proliferation and functional activation .
The binding of transcription factors to specific sites within the promoters of these cytokine genes is responsible for their up-regulation .
A 300-bp IL-2 promoter ( IL-2P ) region upstream of the transcription start site is sufficient to transcriptionally regulate IL-2 expression in response to TCR stimulation ( 42 ) .
Several transcription factors , such as NFAT , Oct-1 , AP-1 , and NF-kB , have been shown to bind to identified enhancer elements in the IL-2P .
In lymphocytes , Fos and Jun form a competent transcription factor complex that activates the AP-1 enhancer elements within the promoters for several genes of diverse function , such as granzyme B , CD11c , CD40L , and CD69 genes , as well as the cytokine promoters .
Thus , it is apparent that regulation of the binding activity of the AP-1 complex is integral to the control of many aspects of immune function , including cytokine production , cytolytic effector function , adhesion , and cell survival and proliferation .
In this report , we demonstrate that overexpression of activated Rho synergizes with PMA to augment AP-1 transcriptional activity .
Overexpression of CAAX-deleted activated Rho abolishes the enhancement .
This effect is not mediated through the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway , as it is not affected by overexpression of DN MEK or by the addition of a MEK inhibitor .
The plasma membrane-asso-ciated Rho binds to PKCa but does not bind to PKCB , -y , or -g. In addition , expression of the N-terminal regulatory domain of PKCa blocks activated Rho-plus-PMA-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activation .
These data suggest that the small GTP-binding protein , Rho , potentiates AP-1 enhancer element activity and may augment AP-1l-containing gene transcription following T-cell activation .

RESULTS Small GTP-binding proteins potentiate AP-1 transcriptional activation following PMA stimulation .
Most cytokine genes contain several transcriptional elements in the promoter region that exert tight control of gene transcription following stimulation .
Regulation of the IL-2P is the most extensively studied model of cytokine transcriptional regulation .
The minimal IL-2P contains several regulatory elements , including a TATA box and AP-1 , Oct-1 , NFAT , NF- « B , and CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) binding sites ( 5 , 34 ) .
The DNA binding activity of the transcription factors is controlled by distinct regulatory proteins .
For example , NFAT binding is regulated by calcineurin , NF-kB binding is regulated by IB , and AP-1 protein binding is regulated by PKC ( 13 , 48 ) .
The inhibition of Rho has been shown to affect T-cell functions ( 17 ) , and Rho in nonlymphoid cells regulates transcription of c-fos .
To address the effect of Rho on transcriptional activation in lymphoid cells , luciferase reporter constructs that contain the IL-2P TATA box region and/or a combination of three or five repeats of individual IL-2P elements ( AP-1 , Oct-1 , NFAT , NF-kB , and CD28RE ) were generated as listed in Table 1 .
These reporter constructs , in combination with vector ( pEBG ) or pEBG-V14rho , were transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells .
Transfected cells were left untreated or stimulated with 10 ng of PMA per ml .
In cells transfected with vector alone , PMA induced minimal transcriptional activity of each IL-2 enhancer element .
In cells that overexpress activated Rho , the basal transcriptional activity of each enhancer element was increased three- to fivefold compared to vector-transfected 4988 CHANG ET AL .

1A ) .
The transcriptional activity of the AP-1 ( -140 region ) element ( -140 AP-1 ) was potentiated 20- to 30-fold following PMA stimulation in V14Rho-transfected cells .
The transcriptional activity of each of the remaining enhancer elements increased approximately 5- to 10-fold in the presence of PMA in V14Rho-transfected cells compared to vector-transfected cells .
Therefore , it appears that V14Rho has a potent effect on the -140 AP-1 enhancer element within the IL-2P .
Rho family members have distinct functions in cytoskeletal rearrangement ( 35 ) .
Rho regulates stress fiber formation , Rac regulates lamellipodia , and Cdc42 triggers the formation of filopodia .
To address if Cdc42 and Rac are also involved in AP-1 transcriptional activation , pEBG-V12rac and pEBG-V12edc42 were cotransfected with pGL2 ( -140 AP-1 ) into Jurkat T cells .
As shown in Fig .
1B , the transcriptional activity of -140 AP-1 was potentiated 20-fold in the presence of PMA in pEBG-V12ecdc42-transfected cells and about 10-fold in pEBG-V12rac-transfected cells .
Rho associates with PKCa .
Pkclp has been shown to associate with Rholp and to act as its downstream target in Sec-charomyces cerevisiae ( 37 ) .
Given the marked effect of V14Rho on the AP-1 enhancer element , we set out to investigate the possibility that Rho associates with PKC family members in T cells .
Western blot analysis of precipitated proteins that associated with GST-V14Rho , using antibodies specific for PKCa , -B , -y , and -£ , revealed that only PKCa , not PKCB , -y , or -g , associated with activated GST -Rho ( Fig .
2A ) .
The anti-PKCa antibodies did not cross-react with PKN , a PKC-like serine/ threonine kinase ( data not shown ) ( 4 ) .
Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were expressed ( Fig .
2B ) .
To further characterize this association , cells were transiently transfected with vector or V14Rho and subjected to subcellular fractionation .
As shown in Fig .
2C , PKCa constitutively associated with V14Rho in the membrane fraction only ; however , V14Rho was equally distributed in the membrane and cytosolic fractions .
In contrast , GST was found only in the cytosol ( Fig .
2D ) .
To investigate the structural requirement of Rho for its association with PKCa in Jurkat T cells , we transiently overexpressed activated V14Rho , wt Rho , DN N19Rho , and V14Rho-ACAAX ( a Rho construct that lacks four amino acids necessary for membrane localization ) .
As shown in Fig .
2E , PKCa associated strongly with V14Rho , to a lesser extent with wt Rho , and N19Rho , and only weakly with V14Rho-ACAAX .
Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were expressed ( Fig .
2F ) .
I ) £ﬂ'ector domains and localization of V14Rho to the membrane are required for the potentiation of AP-1 transcriptional activity .
The crystal structures of Ras-RasGAP and Rho-RhoGAP complexes have been solved , and their effector domains have been determined ( 44 ) .

are important for phosphate binding , and residues 35 to 40 of Ras are required for effector binding .
To address whether the effector domain of Rho regulates the activated-Rho enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity , pEBG-V38T/V1l4rho , pEBG-F39Y/V14rho , pEBG-E40I/V14rho , pEBG-N41I/V14rho , or pEBG-T37A/E40I/V14rho was cotransfected with pGL2 ( -140 AP-1 ) into Jurkat T cells .
As shown in Fig .
3A , mutation of residue 39 , 40 , or 37 and 40 of Rho abolished activated-Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity following PMA stimulation .
However , mutation of residue 38 or 41 had no effect on activated-Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity .
The levels of expression of GST-Rho fusion proteins of these mutants are shown in Fig .
3B .
The N termini of small GTP-binding proteins are important for GTPase activity and effector functions .
Moreover , the C termini of the members of the GTP-binding family of proteins possess posttranslational modification sites for carboxylation , prenylation , or geranylgeranylation ( 12 , 53 , 54 ) .
Posttranslational modifications are required for targeting the small G proteins to the proper membrane location .
As shown in Fig .
2C and E , membrane-bound V14Rho strongly associated with PKCa ; removal of the membrane-targeting signal of V14Rho diminished its association with PKCa .
To address if membrane targeting of V14Rho is required for its enhancement of AP-1 transcriptional activity , V14Rho-ACAAX was transiently co Rho REGULATES AP-1 TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION - 4989 transfected with the pGL2 ( -140 AP-1 ) luciferase reporter construct .
As shown in Fig .
3C , overexpression of V14Rho-ACAAX did not enhance basal or PMA-stimulated AP-1 transcriptional activity .
In addition , expression of N19Rho did not potentiate AP-1 transcriptional activity ( data not shown ) .
V14Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity is independent of the MEK pathway .
The AP-1 complex is comprised of the transcription factors Fos and Jun .
Since JunB DNA binding activity is regulated by Ras , we addressed the possibility that activated Ras can also enhance AP-1 transcriptional activity ( 9 , 10 , 52 ) .
pEBG-V12ras and pGL2 ( -140 AP-1 ) luciferase constructs were transfected into Jurkat T cells and stimulated with PMA .
The AP-1 transcriptional activity in cells transfected with V12Ras was similar to that seen in vector-transfected cells following PMA stimulation ( Fig .
4 , left ) .
The Ras-MEK-MAPK pathway links a number of cell surface receptors to nuclear events .
To address the involvement of MAPK in V14Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity , DN MEK and a MEK inhibitor were used in the assay .
The pGL2 ( -140 AP-1 ) luciferase reporter construct was cotransfected with pEBG or V14Rho in the presence or absence of pEBG-DN-MEK into Jurkat T cells .
Transfected cells were left untreated or stimulated with PMA , and luciferase activities were determined .
As shown in Fig .
4 ( right ) , DN MEK did not affect V14Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activation , while it partially blocked the PMA enhancement of AP-1 transcriptional activity .
To confirm these findings , vector- and V14Rho-transfected cells were treated with 50 um MEK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) for 30 min prior to PMA stimulation .
As shown in Fig .
4 ( right ) , the MEK inhibitor did not affect V14Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activation .
However , the MEK inhibitor partially blocked the PMA-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in vector- or V14Rho-transfected cells .
Two possible interpretations of these results are ( i ) the MEK inhibitor blocked only the PMA-dependent enhancement of AP-1 transcription and ( ii ) the synergy seen with V14Rho plus PMA partially recruits the MEK pathway .
N-PKCa blocks activated-Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity .
Our observation that PKCa physically associated with Rho in the membrane fraction of cells suggested a role for this interaction in the Rho-induced regulation of AP-1 activity .
This observation is consistent with a previous report that Rholp binds the N-terminal regulatory domain of Pkelp in S. cerevisiae .
To determine whether PKCa plays a role in activated-Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activation , Myc-tagged wt PKCa and pGL2 ( -140 AP-1 ) were cotransfected into Jurkat T cells .
As shown in Fig .
5A , coexpression of PKCa and V14Rho enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity following PMA stimulation .
To further address if Rho binding to PKCa affects V14Rho-mediated AP-1 transcriptional activity , a construct encoding c-Myc-tagged N-terminal regulatory domain of PKCa was coexpressed with activated Rho in Jurkat T cells .
Overexpression of N-PKCa blocked the basal- and activated-Rho-plus-PMA-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity ( Fig .
5B ) , supporting a role for this kinase in mediating the downstream effects of Rho .
Equal amounts of GST-V14Rho were expressed in these transfections ( Fig .
5C ) .
N-PKCa that associated with GST-V14Rho was detected by anti-c-Myc antibody ( 9E10 ) immunoblotting ( Fig .
5D ) .

An intact effector domain and membrane targeting of V14Rho are required for the enhancement of AP-1 transcriptional activation .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 10 pg of pEBG , V14Rho , V38T/V14Rho , F39Y/V14Rho , E40I/V14Rho , N41I/V14Rho , T37A/E40I/V14Rho ( A and B ) or V14Rho-ACAAX ( C ) , and approximately 10 ug of AP-1 enhancer element reporter construct .

ment ( 17 , 20 ) , and cell survival and cytolytic function ( 27 ) .
Although many recent studies have focused on the role and regulation of Rho in lymphocytes , little is understood about the effector mechanisms elicited by Rho that lead to these terminal events .
We have conducted studies to delineate downstream effectors of Rho in T cells .
We have found a striking effect of V14Rho on AP-1 transcriptional activity .
This result is consistent with a pivotal role for Rho in lymphocyte signaling , as it is well established that AP-1 is critically involved in T-cell activation .
In lymphocytes , the AP-1 enhancer element is found in the promoters of genes that encode proteins involved in the immune functions for which Rho has also been impli-cated , as described above .
The AP-1 enhancer element binds transcription factors of the Fos and Jun families that have formed homodimers or heterodimers prior to binding .
At least four Fos family members ( c-Fos , FosB , Fra-1 , and Fra-2 ) and four Jun family members ( v-Jun , c-Jun , JunB , and JunD ) have been identified .
The binding of Fos and Jun to the AP-1 transcription element of the IL-2P has been characterized .
Mutation of the -140 AP-1 enhancer element ablates PMA- and TCR-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity .
Our data show that Rho enhanced -140 AP-1 transcriptional activity , suggesting that activated Rho may activate transcription factors of the Fos and Jun families .
These data are in agreement with those of others ( 21 ) , which demonstrated that activated Rho enhanced c-fos transcriptional activity .
The transcription of c-fos is regulated through ternary complex factor ( TCF ) and SRF .
Binding of TCF and SRF to the serum response element ( SRE ) coordinately enhances c-fos transcriptional activation .
Mutational analysis of the c-fos promoter revealed that transcription of c-fos can be activated by SRF in the absence of TCF activation .
SRF is activated through a Rho-dependent pathway .
Further studies have shown that PMA enhanced SRF phosphorylation and TCF binding to SRE .
These findings are consistent with our results that PMA and activated Rho synergize to enhance AP-1 transcriptional activation .
Association of PKCa with Rho .
To determine potential upstream regulators of the effect of Rho on AP-1 transcriptional activation , we have dissected kinase pathways critical in T-cell signaling .
We found that the kinase activities of Erk , JNK , and p38 MAPKs were unaffected by coexpression of V14Rho in Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) , consistent with previously published findings in other labs ( 21 , 30 ) .
Furthermore , the inability of DN MEK or a MEK inhibitor to block the Rho-mediated AP-1 transcriptional activity suggested that MAPK is not in Vou .

V12Ras does not enhance AP-1 transcriptional activation , and DN MEK or MEK inhibitor does not block activated Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activation .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with 10 pg of pEBG , 10 pg of pEBG-V12ras , 10 pg of DN MEK , and 10 pg of V14Rho , alone or in combination as indicated , in addition to 2 ug of reporter constructs .
Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with PMA ( 10 ng/m ! ) .
To assay the effect of MEK inhibitor on V14Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activation , MEK inhibitor was added 30 min prior to the addition of PMA .
AP-1-driven luciferase activity was determined .

However , DN MEK and A series of experiments demonstrated that members of the the MEK inhibitor could partially block the V14Rho-plus- PKC family play a critical role in T cell-activation .

Coexpression of wt PKCa augments V1i4Rho-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity , while coexpression of N-PKCa blocks activated-Rho-plus-PMA-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity .

Rholp , binds to the N-terminal pseudosubstrate and C1 domains of Pkelp and activates its kinase activity ( 25 ) in S. cerevisiae ( 37 ) .
More recently , activated Rho has been demonstrated to associate with PKN ( 4 ) , ( 15 ) , and Rho kinase ( 3 ) ; however , the roles of these associations in Rho-dependent function remain to be determined .
In studies reported here , we have shown that Rho associates with PKCa in vivo and that membrane association and residues within the effector domain of Rho are required for maximal enhancement of AP-1 transcriptional activity .
The observations that coexpression of activated Rho and wt PKCa enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity and N-PKCa inhibited Rho signaling underscore the importance of the association of these proteins and support a role for PKCa in vivo .
A previous report ( 6 ) described an effect of PKCO on AP-1 transcriptional activation .
In that study , the authors were unable to detect an effect of PKCa on AP-1 transcriptional activation in assays using an AP-1 sequence derived from the collagenase promoter .
We observed that the AP-1 site derived from the -140 region of the IL-2P was responsive to activated Rho , while other enhancer elements containing AP-1 sites were unaffected , indicating a high level of discrimination in the downstream effects elicited by activated Rho .
Roles for several other members of the PKC family , including PKC , PKC { , PKCn , and PKCA ( 22 , 24 , 49 ) , in transcriptional activation have also been described .
The association of PKCa with Rho and their mutual involvement in AP-1 transcriptional activation provides one link in the elucidation of the signal transduction machinery that regulates nuclear events .
It remains to be determined if the association between PKCa and Rho is direct or indirect .
In our preliminary studies , we have been unable to detect a direct physical interaction between these two proteins by far-Western analysis ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the association requires the cooperative interaction with other molecules or the native conformation of PKCa .
There are many unanswered questions as to the immediate biochemical effects that this interaction in-duces .
For example , does overexpression of activated Rho regulate the kinase activity of PKCa ?
Since we were able to detect this association only in the membrane fraction of cells , it seems likely that the PKCa complexed with Rho is in an activated state , as previous studies have indicated that translocation of PKCa to the membrane correlates with its activation ( 16 , 48 ) .
Alternatively , could PKCa modulate Rho activity in the cell through direct phosphorylation or indirectly by phosphorylation of a GEF , GDI , GAP , or other intermediate molecule ?
Identification of the specific gene ( s ) regulated by this mode of AP-1 activation will indicate which aspect ( s ) of immune function is dependent on this interaction and its downstream ef-fects .
