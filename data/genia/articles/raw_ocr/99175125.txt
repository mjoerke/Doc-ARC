Activation of NF-KB is thought to be required for cytokine release from LPS-responsive cells , a critical step for endotoxic effects .
Here we investigated the role and involvement of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-a ) signal transducer molecules in LPS signaling in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells ( HDMEC ) and THP-1 monocytic cells .
LPS stimulation of HDMEC and THP -1 cells initiated an IL-1 receptor-like NF-KB signaling cascade .
In transient cotransfection experiments , dominant negative mutants of the IL-1 signaling pathway , including MyD88 , IRAK , IRAK2 , and TRAF6 inhibited both IL-1-and LPS-induced NF- « B-luciferase activity .
LPS-induced NF-KB activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 that is involved in TNF sig-naling .
LPS-induced activation of NF- « B-responsive reporter gene was not inhibited by IL-1 receptor antago-nist .
TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed on the cell surface of HDMEC and THP cells .
These findings suggest that a signal transduction molecule in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the IL-1 receptor/toll-like receptor ( TLR ) super family , and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1 in mononuclear phagocytes and endothelial cells .

Printed in U.S.A. Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , or endotoxin , is the major component of the outer surface of Gram-negative bacteria .
LPS is a potent activator of cells of the immune and inflammatory systems , including macrophages , monocytes , and endothelial cells , and contributes to systemic changes known as septic shock ( 1 , 2 ) .
LPS-induced activation of monocytes/macrophages is mediated through a cell surface receptor glycoprotein , known as membrane CD14 ( mCD14 ) .
The binding of LPS to mCD14 is enhanced by LPS-binding protein , a plasma protein ( 3 ) .
On the other hand , vascular endothelial cells do not express mCD14 and respond to LPS only in the presence of soluble CD14 ( 4-6 ) .
We ( 7 ) and others ( 8-12 ) have shown that protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ERK1 , ERK2 , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and c-Jun N-terminal kinase appear to be important for LPS-induced cellular activation .
LPS rapidly induces nuclear factor- « kB ( NF-kB ) in both monocytic ( 13 , 14 ) and endothelial cells ( 15 ) .
Activation of NF-KB is required for release of proinflammatory cytokines , including interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) ( 16 , 17 ) .
However , the molecular mechanisms of the signaling cascade induced by LPS to activate NF-kB are un-known .
Furthermore , the signaling LPS receptor is still unidentified .
The toll gene controls dorsoventral pattern formation during the early embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster ( 18 ) .
Toll initiates a signaling pathway homologous to the mammalian NF- « B activation cascade ( 18 ) .
The toll family of receptors is defined by homology to the Drosophila toll protein ( 19 , 20 ) .
The mammalian IL-1 receptor is a member of the toll family ( 18 ) .
Five other mammalian family members ( toll-like receptors 1 through 5 , TLR1-5 ) have been identified , but their function is uncertain .
Several TLRs , similar to IL-1R , have been observed to signal through the NF-kB pathway ( 19-22 ) .
LPS signaling also leads to activation of NF-kB , and recent studies suggested that a toll-like receptor ( TLR ) might be a signaling receptor that is activated by LPS ( 22 , 23 ) .
In these reports , expression of TLR2 in LPS-unresponsive human embryonic kidney cells ( 293 cells ) enabled these cells to respond to LPS stimulation ( 22 , 23 ) .
These investigators observed that LPS binds to a TLR2 extracellular domain and suggested that TLR2 is a candidate for a long sought LPS receptor , although the data were generated from a transfected and normally LPS-unresponsive cell line ( 22 , 23 ) .
A recent study in the LPS-resistant C3H-HeJ mice has implicated another toll homologue ( TLR4 ) as a signal-transducing component in the LPS receptor complex ( 24 ) .
It is known that the IL-1 signaling pathway in mammals is strikingly similar to the toll signaling pathway in Drosophila ( 19-22 ) .
The molecular events linking the IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling complex to the induction of NF-kB have been recently characterized .
Upon binding of IL-1 to its receptors ( IL-1R ) , IL-1R associates with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein ( IL-1RAcP ) ( 26 , 27 ) .

Dominant negative versions of MyD88 and TRAF6G but not TRAF2 inhibited LPS-induced NF-KB activity in human THP-1 cells .
Human THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with NF- « B-luciferase and B-galactosidase reporter vectors and dominant negative mutants of MyD88 , TRAF6 , and TRAF2 for 24 h. The total amount of DNA was kept constant with peDNA3 vector .
The cells were then stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
for different periods of time ( A ) or increasing amounts of LPS for 6 h ( B ) .
Some cells were transfected with different amounts of MyD88 mutants and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h ( C ) .
Cells were transfected with TRAF2 and TRAF6 mutants and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h ( D ) .
Luciferase and B-galactosidase assays were performed as described under `` Exper-imental Procedures . ''

MyD88 in turn recruits two distinct putative serine-threo-nine kinases , namely IL-1 receptor-activated kinase ( IRAK ) and IRAK2 , to the receptor complex ( 30 ) .
IRAK and IRAK2 interact subsequently with the adapter molecule , TNF receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6 ) ( 31 , 32 ) , which links them to the protein kinase NF- « B-inducing kinase ( NIK ) ( 83 ) .
NIK activates the IkB kinase complex ( IKKa and IKK $ B ) that directly phosphorylates IxB ( 34-36 ) .
The phosphorylation of initiates ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation and liberates and activates NF-kB ( 16 , 17 ) .
On the other hand , TNF and its receptor complex activate TRAF2 , but not TRAF6 ( 37 , 38 ) .
Downstream signaling pathways of IL-1 and TNF distal to TRAF6 and TRAF2 converge ( 16 , 17 ) .
In this study , we tested the hypothesis that LPS activates NF-kB through IL-1 signaling molecules , namely MyD88 , IRAK , IRAK2 , and TRAF6 in two LPS-responsive cell types .
Dominant negative mutants of these signaling elements were transfected into human monocytes ( THP-1 cells ) and human dermal endothelial cells together with a NF- « B-responsive reporter gene , and LPS-induced NF-kB luciferase activity was measured .
Our results indicate that LPS transduces signals of NF- « B activation utilizing the IL-1 signaling molecules in both monocytic and endothelial cells .

The anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antisera were raised against synthetic pep-tides ( extracellular domains of TLR2 and TLR4 ) by BABCO ( Richmond , CA ) .
The sequence of the synthetic peptide for TLR2 was a 27-amino acid peptide , starting at amino acid residue 277 of the mature hTLR2 ( FRASDNDRVIDPGKVETLTIRRLHIPR ) , whereas the peptide for TLRA4 was a 23-amino acid peptide , starting at amino acid 201 of mature hTLR4 ( FKEIRHKLTLRNNFDLSLNVMKT ) .

After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody , the membrane was developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL detection kit .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A series of defense mechanisms are triggered in vertebrates and invertebrates in response to Gram-negative bacterial infections by sensing the presence of LPS ( 1-3 ) .
LPS-induced signal relay is thought to be initiated following its binding to specific cellular receptors which then triggers intracellular signaling pathways leading to the activation of NF-kB ( 4-12 ) in various LPS-responsive cell types .
To date , the identification of a functional , signal-transducing component of the putative LPS receptor complex and the signaling pathways involved in LPS-induced activation of NF-kB have remained elusive .
Recent findings suggested that LPS might use signaling molecules of the TLR and IL-1R superfamilies to transduce signals ( 23 , 24 ) .
To investigate the potential involvement of IL-1 and TNF signal transducers in LPS signaling in two LPS-responsive cell types , HDMEC and THP-1 cells , we cotransfected dominant negative constructs of various components of the NF- « B signaling cascades for IL-1 and TNF together with NF- « B-luciferase reporter gene .
LPS induced the activation of NF-kB in a time- ( Fig .
1A ) and dose-dependent ( Fig .
1B ) manner in THP-1 cells .
Activation of NF-kB reached a maximum at a LPS concentration of 100 ng/ml and when cells were stimulated with LPS for 6 h ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Similar results were also obtained from endothelial cells .
A mutant version of MyD88 ( AMyD88 ) , encoding only for the COOH-terminal toll-IL-1R-like domain , which abrogates IL-1R-induced NF-kB activation ( 30 ) , inhibited both LPS- and IL-1-mediated NF- « B activation ( Figs .
1C and 2 , A and B ) but not TNF-induced NF-kB activation ( Fig .
2C ) .

In panel B , THP-1 and HDMEC cell lysates were resolved with SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-TLR2 , anti-TLR4 antibodies , and corresponding prebleeds .
Molecular mass markers are indicated at the right .
The apparent molecular masses for TLR2 and TLR4 were 85 kDa and 92 kDa , respectively .
< - 9 % 4 kDa 4-974 kDa signaling complex ( 30 ) .
Dominant negative constructs of IRAK ( AIRAK ) and IRAK2 ( AIRAK2 ) inhibited both LPS- ( Figs .
1D and 24 ) and IL-1R-mediated NF-kB activation ( Fig .
2B ) , but not TNF-induced NF-kB activation ( Fig .
2C ) .
NF-kB activation induced by various cytokine receptors is mediated by members of the TRAF adapter family .
While TRAF2 plays a crucial role in NF-KB activation by TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 ( 37 , 38 ) , TRAF6 has been implicated in IL-1 signaling ( 31 , 32 ) .
Therefore , we next determined whether dominant negative versions of TRAF6 ( ATRAF6 ) or TRAF2 ( ATRAF2 ) could act to inhibit LPS-induced NF-KB activity .
ATRAF-6 but not ATRAF2 significantly impaired LPS-induced NF- « B activation , suggesting that TRAF6 may act as an additional downstream mediator of LPS-induced NF-kB activation cascade ( Figs .
1D and 24 ) .
ATRAF2 blocked TNF-induced NF-KB activation in endothelial cells ( Fig .
2C ) , but not LPS-induced NF- « B activation ( Figs .
1D and 24 ) .
Because the pathways for IL-1 and TNF-a signaling converge at the level of NIK for NF- « B activation , we next investigated whether dominant negative NIK mutant ( ANIK ) would block LPS-induced , as well as IL-1- and TNF-induced , NF- « B activation .
As expected , ANIK blocked NF-kB activation induced by LPS , IL-1 , and TNF- @ ( Fig .
2 ) .
IL-1 receptor antagonist had no effect on LPS-induced NF- « B activation ( Fig .
24 ) but inhibited IL-l-induced NF- « B activation in endothelial cells ( Fig .
2B ) .

Schematic diagram of signaling cascades for LPS , IL-1 , and TNF .
The diagram illustrates that LPS utilizes IL-1 signaling molecules ( MyD88 , IRAK , IRAK2 , and TRAF6 ) but not TNF signaling molecules ( TRAF2 ) .
LPS stimulation of cells is not due to an autocrine effect such as LPS-induced IL-1 release from endothelial cells .
These data suggest that LPS stimulation of endothelial cells and THP-1 cells triggers an IL-1R-like signal relay leading to activation of NF- « B ( Fig .
5 ) .
Further support for this concept is provided by the observation of a 15-year-old girl with recurrent infections who was found to be resistant to both LPS and IL-1 stimulation in vivo and in vitro ( 39 ) .
The authors suggested that resistance to LPS and IL-1 was due to a defect very early in the common signaling pathway for LPS and IL-1 ( 39 ) .
The experiments with IL-1R antagonist also suggest that LPS does not use IL-1 receptor to transduce signals in endothelial cells .
Although recent findings imply that TLR2 or other members of the TLR family , which use the IL-1R signaling pathway , might be an important mediator for LPS signaling ( 23 , 24 ) , further studies are needed to identify naturally existing LPS receptors in LPS-responsive cells .
Beutler and coworkers ( 25 ) recently reported that TLR4 is the protein encoded by the LPS gene , which is mutated in the LPS-non-responsive C3H-HeJ mice .
To investigate the expression of the TLR2 and TLR4 message in HDMEC and THP-1 cells , we used RT-PCR .
Human THP-1 and HDMEC were found to express significant levels of both TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA ( Fig .
3 ) .
Expression levels of TLR2 appeared to be stronger in THP-1 whereas the expression level of TLR4 appeared to be stronger in HDMEC .
Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was confirmed with Northern analysis in THP-1 cells .
Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting data demonstrate that TLR2 and TLR4 proteins are expressed on THP-1 cells and HDMEC ( Fig .
4 ) .
Staining was absent in THP-1 and HDMEC incubated without the first antibody or incubated with rabbit IgG .
These results suggest that TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed in endothelial and monocytic cells and may represent a signaling component of a cellular receptor for LPS which signals through an IL-l-like pathway ( Fig .
5 ) .
In summary , we have demonstrated in endothelial and THP-1 cells that LPS-induced NF-KB activation is mediated by IL-1R signaling molecules , namely MyD88 , IRAK , IRAK2 , and TRAF6 , but not the TNF signaling molecule , TRAF2 .
We have also shown that TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed on the cell surface of two LPS-responsive cell types , endothelial cells and THP-1 cells .
These data strongly suggest that a crucial signaling component in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the LPS Activates NF-kB through IL-1 Signaling Molecules IL-1 receptor/TLR superfamily , and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1 .
MyD88 appears to represent the most upstream mediator of the LPS-mediated signaling cascade , which ultimately activates NF-kB , thus driving transcriptional activation of several cytokines .
Thus , MyD88 may represent a potentially useful therapeutic target to control the molecular switch from innate to the adaptive immune response .
