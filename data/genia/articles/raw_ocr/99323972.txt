The signal transduction events triggered by cross-linking of the CD40 receptor have been widely studied in B cell lines , but little is known about signaling following CD40 stimulation of monocytes and resting tonsillar B cells .
Therefore , we studied the CD40 pathway in highly purified human monocytes and resting B cells .
After CD40 triggering , a similar activation of the NF-B ( but not of the AP-1 ) transcription factor complex occurred in both cell preparations .
However , the components of the NF-sB complexes were different in monocytes and B cells , because p50 is part of the NF- « B complex induced by CD40 triggering in both monocytes and B cells , whereas p65 was only induced in B cells .
In contrast , although the Janus kinase 3 tyrosine kinase was associated with CD40 molecules in both monocytes and resting B cells , Janus kinase 3 phosphorylation induction was observed only in CD4O-activated monocytes , with subsequent induction of STAT5a DNA binding activity in the nucleus .
These results suggest that the activation signals in human B cells and monocytes differ following CD40 stimulation .
This observation is consistent with the detection of normal CD40-induced monocyte activation in patients with CD40 ligand * hyper IgM syndrome in whom a defect in CD4O0-induced B cell activation has been reported .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 163 : 787-793 .
D40 is a 50-kDa molecule that is present on the surface of B cells , monocytic/dendritic cells , some carcinoma cell lines , and human thymus epithelium ( 1-4 ) .
The CD40-CD40 ligand ( CD4OL ) ® interactions between B cells and activated Th cells play a key role in immune responses and have therefore been widely studied .
Cross-linking of CD40 molecules on B cells by their ligand ( CD4OL/CD154 ) causes Ig class switching ( 5-10 ) , cell proliferation , and rescue from apoptosis ( 11-14 ) .
The activation of monocytes by CD40 molecules leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-a ) , up-regulation of surface molecules ( CD54 , CD80 , CD86 , and HLA class II ) , tumoricidal activity ( 15-17 ) , and rescue from apoptosis ( 18 ) .
The CD40 stimulation of dendritic cells plays a major role in the defense against pathogens , because large amounts of IL-12 are produced ( 19 ) and specific T cell cytotoxicity is induced ( 20-22 ) .
Studies of CD4O- and CD4OL-deficient mice ( 23-27 ) and human patients with CD4OL mutations ( X-linked hyper IgM syndrome ) ( 28-32 ) have demonstrated that CD40-CD40L in *Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale , Unité 429 , Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades , Paris , France ; *Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unité 520 , Institut Curie , Paris , France ; *Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine de l'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris , Site Saint-Antoine , Paris , France ; and ©Serono Pharmaceuticals Research Institute , Geneva , Switzerland Received for publication October 14 , 1998 .

Another form of hyper IgM syndrome secondary to a defect in the CD40 activation pathway in B cells has also been reported ( 33-35 ) ( CD4OL * hyper IgM ) .
Patients with this syndrome have a defect in Ig switching but are not susceptible to infection by intracellular pathogens ; these patients exhibit normal in vitro CD4O-stimulated monocyte and dendritic cell activities ( 36 ) .
This may be due to T cell activation via the CD4OL or to differences in the CD40 activation pathways of B lymphocytes and monocytes/dendritic cells , respectively .
We investigated the latter hypothesis by comparing the biochemical events induced by the CD40 stimulation of highly purified human resting B cells and elutriated monocytes .
Little is known about the biochemical events induced by the CD40 activation of monocytes and resting B cells , because most studies have focused on preactivated B cell lines .
Several proteins are involved in the CD40 activation of B cell lines .
They include protein kinases such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase , phospholipase C-y2 , and lyn , which are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues ( 37 ) , and the transcription factor complexes NF-kB , AP-1 , and NF-AT , which are induced ( 33 , 38 , 39 ) .
Proteins of the TNF receptor-associated factor ( TRAF ) family ( TRAF2 , TRAF3 , TRAF5 , and TRAF6 ) and others ( TRAF family member associated NF-KB activator ( TANK ) , NF- « B-inducing kinase ( NIK ) , and c inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( clAP ) ) ( 40-45 ) interact directly or indirectly with the intracytoplasmic tail of CD40 and are involved in NF- « B activation .
The tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 3 ( Jak3 ) has been found in B cell lines , in which it interacts with CD40 .
It is tyrosine-phosphorylated after CD40 triggering and induces STAT3 translocation ( 46 ) .
However , no phosphorylation of Jak3 was detected in CD4O-activated murine spleen B cells , whereas STAT6 induction was reported ( 47 ) .
In a more recent study , Jabara et al .
showed that CD40 signaling in Jak3-deficient human B cells , including up-regulation of membrane marker expression , proliferation , and Ig switching , is functional ( 48 ) .
This observation demonstrates that Jak3 is not required for CD40 phs cytokine-induced B cell activation .

We obtained evidence for the induction of NF- « B ( but not AP-1 ) transcription factors in monocytes and resting B cells after CD40 triggering .
Jak3 was similarly associated with CD40 molecules in both cell populations , but tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 was detected only in monocytes after CD40 cross-linking .
STAT5a was induced in activated monocytes , but no STAT DNA binding activity was detected after the CD40 stimulation of resting B cells .
This finding suggests that there are differences in the CD40 activation pathways of resting B lymphocytes and monocytes .
Materials and Methods Cell preparations PBMCs that had been obtained from healthy donors by leukapheresis were subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation .
The mononuclear cell interface was further separated into a monocyte-enriched fraction by coun-tercurrent centrifugal elutriation using a Beckman J6 M/E centrifuge with a JE-5.0 elutriator rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Palo Alto , CA ) .
We used the technique described by Faradji et al .
( 49 ) , slightly modified in terms of the elutriation medium , with Hank 's medium replaced by a phosphate buffer .
The monocyte preparation was > 90 % pure as assessed by CD14 staining , with < 2 % B lymphocytes .
Tonsillar B cells were obtained by passing tonsil specimens through mesh and rosetting with 2-aminoethyl-isothiouronium bromide-treated SR-BCs to remove T cells .
Cells were subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and subsequently centrifuged through a discontinuous Percoll gradient to isolate small resting B cells .
The cell population ( recovered from the 50-55 % interface ) was analyzed by immunofluorescence .
More than 90 % of the cells were CD19* , p* , 8* .
Contaminating monocytes and T lymphocytes accounted for < 5 % of the cells .
Abs and reagents For immunofluorescence studies , FITC-labeled anti-CD40 mAb was purchased from Diaclone ( Besangon , France ) , PE-labeled anti-CD14 Ab and PE-labeled anti-CD19 Ab were obtained from Becton Dickinson ( Moun-tain View , CA ) , and FITC-labeled polyclonal Abs directed against IgM and IgD were purchased from Caltag ( San Francisco , CA ) .
For activation studies , the anti-CD40 mAb BB20 and an irrelevant mouse IgG1 control were obtained from Diaclone and used at a concentration of 10 ug/ml .
The soluble CD4O0L ( sCD4O0L ) , which was prepared as described previously ( 50 ) , was used at a final concentration of 10 ug/ml .
Tonomycin was purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) ; PMA was obtained from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) .
IL-4 was obtained from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) .
Rabbit polyclonal Abs against Jak3 , p65 ( Rel-A ) , c-Rel , STAT1 ( p84/ p91 ) , STAT2 , STAT4 , the C-terminal part of STAT5a ( sc-1081 X ) , and STAT6 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) , as was the anti-CD40 Ab ( sc-974 ) used for immunoprecipitation .
The Ab directed to the p50 component of NF- « B was kindly donated by R. Weil ( Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) .
The antiphosphotyrosine Ab 4G10 and the anti-STAT3 Ab were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ) .
The Ab directed against the N-terminal part of STATS5a was kindly provided by Dr. B. Groner ( Institute for Experimental Cancer Research , Tumor Biology Center , Freiburg , Germany ) ( 51 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) Monocytes or resting B cells ( 20 X 10° ) were activated for 30 min in RPMI 1640 in the presence of the anti-CD40 mAb BB20 ( 10 ug/ml ) , sCD40L ( 10 g/tol ) , IL-4 ( 100 U/ml ) , or a combination of PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )

Cells were then washed once in cold PBS , and nuclear extracts were prepared as described elsewhere ( 52 ) , with minor changes in procedure .
Briefly , cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min in buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KCI , 0.5 mM DTT , and 2 mM PMSF ) containing the following protease inhibitors : leupeptin , aprotinin , pepstatin , and antipain , each at a concentration of 4 pg/ml for monocytes and 2 ug/ml for B cells .
Samples were then centrifuged , and the pellet was suspended in 25 pl of buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.8 ) , 420 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mM DTT , and 2 mM PMSF ) containing the protease inhibitors .

Nuclear extracts were incubated separately for 30 min at 4°C with each of the double-stranded labeled probes for NF- « B ( 5-GATCCCAA GAGGGATTTCACCTAAATCC-3 ' ) , for AP-1 ( 5-GATCCGCTTGAT GACTCAGCCGGAA-3 '' ) , and for STAT factors with the y response region ( GRR ) probe from the FeyRI gene ( 5-ATTTCCCAGAAAAGAC CCTTTAT-3 ' ) .
The samples were then loaded onto a nondenaturing 5 % poly acrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 14 V/cm in a low-ionic-strength buffer ( 0.5 % Tris boric acid EDTA buffer ( TBE ) .
Gels were dried and examined with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunny-vale , CA ) .
Competition assays were conducted with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe added to the labeled probe .
The oligonucleotide probes used for STAT competition assays were the y-activated site of the IFN regulator factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) gene promoter ( 5'-GATCCATTTCCCCGAAA TGA-3 ' ) ( 53 ) and the binding site of the bovine B-casein ( B-CAS ) gene promoter ( 5-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATC-3 ' ) ( 54 ) .
IRF-1 and B-CAS probes are both STAT consensus binding sites .
For supershift assay , specific Abs to NF- « B components ( p50 , p65 ( Rel-A ) , and c-Rel ) were added ; the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4°C before adding labeled NF- « B probe .
Anti-STAT Abs ( 2 ug ) were added during incubation with the STAT-labeled probe .
Immunoprecipitation Monocytes or small resting B cells were incubated with the anti-CD40 mAb BB20 ( 10 g/m ! )
or the irrelevant IgG1 control ( 10 ug/ml ) for various times ( from 1 to 30 min ) .

The precipitate was washed several times in lysis buffer , suspended in Laemmli sample buffer , and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Immobilon-P , Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
Membranes were probed with antiphosphotyrosine Ab or with the Ab of interest , with detection by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , U.K. ) .
The probe was stripped from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by incubating for 30 min at 50°C in 62.5 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 6.8 ) , 100 mM 2-ME , and 2 % SDS .
Membranes were washed several times in PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 and subsequently reprobed .
Results CD40-mediated stimulation of monocytes and resting B cells activated NF-xB but not AP-1 CD40 triggering has been reported to induce the activation of the transcription factor complexes NF-KB and AP-1 in B cell lines ( 33 , 38 , 39 ) .
Therefore , we studied the activation of these transcription factors in CD4O0-stimulated monocytes and resting B cell preparations by EMSAs with specific labeled oligonucleotides .
NF- « B DNA-binding activity was induced in monocyte nuclei after 30 min of stimulation with sCD4O0L or the anti-CD40 BB20 mAb ( but not by the control IgG1 ) ( Fig .
14 ) .
The activation of AP-1 was not detected in the same nuclear extract ( Fig .
1B ) .
A similar pattern was obtained for the nuclei of resting B cells after stimulation with sCD40L or anti-€CD40 mAb , with activation of NF- « B but not AP-1 transcription factors ( Fig .
1 , C and D ) .
Similar results were obtained if B cells and monocytes were stimulated for =3 h ( data not shown ) .
As expected , PMA plus ionomycin , the positive control , activated both transcription factors in the nuclei of monocytes and resting B cells .
We investigated whether the same components were present in NF- « B complexes induced by CD40 stimulation in nuclei from monocytes and resting B cells by performing supershift assays .
In both cell populations , anti-p50 Abs caused a complete supershift , whereas anti-c-Rel Abs had no effect .
Anti-p65 Abs caused only a partial supershift in nuclei from B cells , and no supershift in nuclei from monocytes ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) .
This observation indicates that the NF- « B complexes resulting from CD40 activation in nuclei from monocytes and B cells contain p50 ; however , p65 is present only in the NF- « B complexes induced in B cells .
Jak3 is associated with CD40 in monocytes and resting B cells Hanissian and Geha showed that CD40 interacts with the tyrosine kinase Jak3 in B cells ( 46 ) .
Therefore , we investigated whether it could be also detected in monocytes and resting B cells by coim-munoprecipitation with an anti-CD40 Ab followed by Western blotting with an anti-Jak3 Ab .
A band was detected on the Western blot at ~115 kDa ; this size corresponds to that of the Jak3 protein in lysates from monocytes and resting B cells , indicating a Jak3 interaction with CD40 in both cell types ( Fig .
3 ) .

activation of resting B cells gave similar results .
Three independent experiments were conducted , and the results shown are typical .
preparations , a slightly smaller ( ~110-kDa ) protein was also detected with the anti-Jak3 Ab .
This band may correspond to a degraded form of Jak3 because monocyte protein extracts are rich in proteases .
It may also correspond to a shorter isoform of Jak3 that is present only in monocytes .
CD40-mediated stimulation of monocytes but not of resting B cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 As Jak3 has been shown to interact with CD40 molecules , we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 in CD4O0-stimulated monocytes and resting B cells .
Cell preparations were incubated with either anti-CD40 mAb ( or a control IgG1 ) or IL-4 for various periods of time ; next , the Jak3 protein was immunopre-cipitated , and the extent of its tyrosine phosphorylation was as-sessed .
In monocytes , anti-CD40 mAb activation ( but not activation by the IgG1 control ) induced Jak3 phosphorylation after 1-30 min of stimulation ( Fig .
44 ) .
Only the 115-kDa band was phos-phorylated ; the second band ( 110 kDa ) was not .
A higher molecular mass phosphorylated band ( 120 kDa , not found in IL-4-stim-ulated monocytes ) , precipitated with Jak3 , was also detected .
This band was not detected on the anti-Jak3 Ab immunoblot ( Fig .
44 , lower panel ) ; therefore , it may correspond to a Jak3-associated , tyrosine-phosphorylated protein .
In sharp contrast , the activation of resting B cells by either the s€CD40L or anti-CD40 mAb resulted in no detectable phosphorylation of Jak3 ( Fig .
4B ) , although significant amounts of Jak3 were precipitated ( Fig .
4B , lower panel ) and coprecipitated with CD40 ( Fig .
3 ) .
As expected , incubation with IL-4 , the positive control , consistently induced Jak3 tyrosine phosphorylation in monocytes and B cells ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
The difference in CD4O0-mediated Jak3 activation did not result from the differential expression of CD40 molecules , because a similar level of CD40 receptors was present on monocytes and resting B cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
CD40-mediated stimulation of monocytes but not of resting B cells induced STAT35a activation Jak tyrosine kinases transduce signals via the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors , leading to STAT dimerization , translocation to the nucleus , and binding to DNA sequences ( 55 ) .
Therefore , we investigated the induction of STAT molecules following the CD40 stimulation of monocytes and resting B cells by EMSA .
A 30-min incubation of monocytes with the anti-€CD40 mAb BB20 ( but not with the control IgG1 ) activated STAT proteins because the labeled GRR probe was retained on the gel .
Moreover , in competitive assays , the addition of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled IRF-1 or B-CAS probes ( both containing STAT consensus binding sites ) led to the complete disappearance of the sig-nal , confirming induction of the DNA-binding activity of STAT factors ( Fig .
64 ) .

In contrast , an Ab directed against the N-terminal part of the STAT5a protein consistently caused a complete supershift of the signal in CD4O-activated monocytes ( Fig .
7B ) .
However , an Ab directed against the C-terminal part of STAT 5a did not cause a significant supershift in CD4O-activated monocytes ( Fig .
7 , A and B ) , but did induce a dramatic supershift in the IL-2-activated B cell line ( Fig .
7C ) .
This observation suggests that an actual truncated form of the STAT 5a molecule , deleted of the C-terminus part , is translocated and activated in the nuclei of CD4O-activated monocytes .
In contrast , no STAT activation was detected in resting B cells after CD40 stimulation ( Fig .
6B ) , regardless of the length of the stimulation period ( 30-180 min ) .
However , NF- « B was activated in these nuclear extracts ( Fig .
6C ) , and IL-4 induced STAT binding activity , as expected ( Fig .
6B ) .
STAT 5a was present in B cells as detected by Western blotting with the Ab directed against the C-terminal part of the STAT5a molecule ( data not shown ) .

i 43 Discussion In this study , we compared the biochemical events induced by CD40 ligation in peripheral blood-elutriated monocytes and tonsillar resting B cells isolated from normal subjects .
The means of isolation used gave preparations of highly purified cells , with < 5 % contaminating cells .
We obtained evidence that CD40 cross-link ing activated the NF-KB transcription factor complex , but not AP-1 , in both monocytes and B lymphocytes .
To our knowledge , nothing has been published previously about the induction of transcription factors in CD4O0-stimulated monocytes , whereas conflicting reports have been published for B cells .
The source of B lymphocytes used probably accounts for the observed differences .

( 39 ) reported that CD40 activation leads to the induction of NF- « B and AP-1 in B cell lines , but that NF-KB is induced only in tonsillar B cells , consistent with our own obser-vations .

- Activation of a truncated form of STATS5a in response to CD40 ligation in monocytes but not in B cells .
A , Supershift assay with specific Abs directed against STAT1 , STAT2 , STAT3 , STAT4 , STAT6 , and the C-terminal part of STAT5a added to nuclear extracts from CD4O-activated monocytes during the binding reaction .
The different effects of the Abs directed against the C-terminal and the N-terminal parts of STATS5a are shown in B .
As a control , the supershift assay was performed using the Ab against the C-terminal part of STAT5a with nuclear extracts of an IL-2-stimulated B cell line ( C ) .

We provide evidence herein that the CD4O-induced NF- « B complexes were not identical in CD4O-activated monocytes and B cells , because the p65 component was present only in the nuclei of B cells , whereas p50 was present in the NF- « B complexes of nuclei from both B cells and monocytes .
Further work is required to fully characterize the NF- « B complexes detected in the nuclei of CD4O-activated monocytes and B cells .
We also investigated the involvement of the Jak3 tyrosine kinase in CD40 activation .
We used an immunoprecipitation study to demonstrate an association between CD40 molecules and Jak3 in both monocytes and resting B cells .
Such an association was also observed in B cell lines and resting B cells by Hanissian and Geha ( 46 ) .
However , our results clearly show that Jak3 was phosphorylated after CD40 triggering in monocytes but not in resting B cells .
As Jak3 activates transcription factors of the STAT family , we performed EMSAs with a consensus probe for STAT proteins .
Using a labeled GRR probe , STAT DNA-binding activity was consistently detected in CD4O-stimulated monocyte nuclear extracts but not in CD4O-activated resting B cell nuclear extracts .
Supershift assays with specific Abs showed that only STAT 5a was induced by CD40 activation in monocytes .
CD4O-triggered Jak3 phosphorylation and STAT translocation , not studied previously in monocytes , have been studied in B cell lines .
Hanissian and Geha described the induction of Jak3 phosphorylation and STAT3 translocation ( but no DNA-binding activity analysis of STAT 's was per-formed ) following CD40 activation in human B cell lines ( 46 ) .
However , Karras et al .
showed that CD40 triggering of unsepa-rated murine spleen B cells led to the induction of STAT6 , but not STAT3 , and that Jak3 tyrosine kinase was not phosphorylated ( 47 ) .
These differences strongly suggest the existence of various CD40-induced biochemical pathways in B cells , according to source and activation status .
In this study , we also found that CD40 activation induced a peculiar form of STATS5a in monocyte nuclei .
In the supershift assay , the Ab directed against the C-terminal part of the STAT 5a protein did not recognize any STAT 5a molecule , whereas the Ab directed against the N-terminal part of the protein did .
This strongly suggests that CD40 ligation results in the induction of a truncated form of STAT5a .
This truncated form of STAT5a may be a degradation product despite the use of protease inhibitors or it may be a monocyte-specific isoform .
Similar monocytic truncated isoforms of STAT 5a have been described in primary monocytes ( 57 ) and in monocyte lines ( 58 ) .
The most striking data from our study are the differences in the patterns of CD40 activation in monocytes and resting B cells .
CD40 triggering activates Jak3 and induces STAT 5a activation in monocytes but not in resting B cells .
The underlying mechanism is unknown .
The amounts of CD40 present on the membranes of B cells and monocytes are similar .
Jak3 appears to be associated with CD40 molecules in a similar way and to a similar extent in both cell populations .
In addition , CD40 activation is known to increase the intracellular concentration of Jak3 in B cells ( 59 ) .
Cell activation status may affect the pattern of responses to CD40 stimulation .
CD40 activation of B cell lines results in a pattern of Jak3 phosphorylation ( 46 ) similar to the one we describe here in monocytes .
However , STAT5a is induced in monocytes , rather than STAT3 , the translocation of which has been reported in B cell lines ( 46 ) .
The lack of Jak3 phosphorylation in CD4O-activated B cells may be balanced by the need for a second signal .
This second signal involves cytokines ( IL-4 or IL-13 ) , which are known to activate Jak kinases and induce STAT proteins ( 54 , 60 , 61 ) .
This suggests that regulatory molecules may be involved in CD40 activation in a cell-specific manner .
Factors , especially those of the TRAF fam- ily , have been reported to be associated with CD40 molecules ( 40-44 ) .
Large amounts of TRAF3 are present in monocytes and B cell lines , whereas this factor is hardly detectable in resting B cells ( 62 , 63 ) .
Therefore , TRAF3 could be a good candidate for the positive regulation of CD40 activation in monocytes ; CD40 triggering alone is sufficient to induce the activation of Jak3 kinase and STAT protein in TRAF3 * cells ( monocytes or activated B cells ) , but not in TRAF3 _- resting B cells .
Our observation that the NF-KB transcription factor was induced in resting B cells activated by CD40 alone is not inconsistent with this hypothesis , because B cells do not require TRAF3 to induce NF-KB after CD40 stimulation ( 63 ) .
However , data from preliminary experiments indicate that a 24-h preincubation of resting B cells induces TRAF3 expression , but that activation of the Jak3/STAT pathway by CD40 agonists does not occur .
Thus , other regulatory molecules , belonging to the TRAF family or interacting with TRAF factors , are probably involved .
The different patterns of CD40 activation of resting B lymphocytes and monocytes observed in this study are consistent with the clinical features of patients suffering from CD4O0L * hyper IgM syndrome ( 33-35 ) .
These patients suffer from Ig switch defect but are not susceptible to intracellular pathogens .
In these patients , the normal CD40 activation of monocyte/dendritic cells contrasting with the complete lack of CD40 response in B lymphocytes ( 36 ) may be due to the existence of different CD40 activation pathways in the two cell types .
