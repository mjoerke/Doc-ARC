1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , was produced both by lavage cells ( 12/12 tuberculosis patients , 2/6 sarcoidosis patients ) and blood mononuclear cells ( 3/5 tuberculosis patients , 0/3 sarcoidosis patients ) from patients but not controls , but significantly greater amounts were produced by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients than those of sarcoidosis patients ( P < 0.001 ) .

T lymphocytes appeared to be an important source of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production , since purified T lymphocytes from all patients with tuberculosis produced 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , production by these cells correlated closely with that produced by unseparated lavage cells .
Because 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can improve the capacity of macrophages to kill mycobacteria , our results support the conclusion that macrophage-lymphocyte interac-tions , mediated at least in part by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , may be an important component of a successful antituberculous immune response .

vitamin D metabolism « tuberculosis « sarcoidosis « T lymphocytes « alveolar macrophages Introduction Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with granulomatous diseases , including sarcoidosis and tuberculosis , can .
produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; at sites of disease activity ( 1 ) .
This spontaneous production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by granulomatous tissues may play an important role in the regulation of granulomatous reactions by influencing the maturation and activity of immune and inflammatory cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
Despite the potential importance of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production at sites of granulomatous reactions , several relevant questions remain unanswered : First , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production in different types of granulomatous disease has never been compared , and therefore it is Address reprint requests to Dr. A.

Secondly , it is unclear , what cell types spontaneously produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Fresh tissue ( 3 , 4 ) or unseparated cells ( 5 ) from sites of granulomatous reactions can spontaneously transform 25 ( OH ) D ; into 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; .
It is reasonable to expect that purified subpopulations of these cells would also retain this capacity , but freshly isolated alveolar macrophages from patients with sarcoidosis produce little or no 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , even though alveolar macrophages from patients with granulomatous diseases do produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; when cultured in vitro for 4-7 d ( 5-9 ) .
In this context , the possibility that other cell types , such as T lymphocytes , can produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; has not been yet evaluated .
To study these questions , we have evaluated the metabolism of 25 ( OH ) D ; by fresh cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from controls and normocalcemic patients with tuberculosis and sarcoidosis .
The goals of this study were to compare 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production in different types of granulomatous disease and to identify the cell types responsible for 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production .
Methods Study populations Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis .
The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was established on the basis of cultures of sputum or gastric aspirates positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( n = 11 ) and/or the presence of epithelioid granulomata with caseous necrosis on histological study of biopsy specimens ( r = 4 ) .
The 12 patients had a mean age of 34+7 yr. All patients had a normal level of serum calcium ( 2.34+0.10 mmol/liter ) and normal 24-h urinary calcium excretion ( 0.04+0.03 mmol/kg per d ; normal range < 0.11 mmol/kg per d ) at the time of evaluation .
Patients were studied before receiving any antituberculous therapy .
Patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis .
The diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis was established according to previously described criteria ( 10 ) .
The six patients had a mean age of 37+10 yr .
Chest radiographic types were as follows : type I ( n = 2 ) , type II ( r = 2 ) , and type III ( n = 2 ) .
The patients had normal serum calcium levels ( 2.37+0.15 mmol/liter ) and normal urinary calcium excretion ( 0.08+0.03 mmol/kg per d ) at the time of evaluation .
One patient had previously received corticoste-roid therapy , which had been discontinued > 3 mo before evaluation .
Control subjects .
Three normal volunteers and two patients undergoing bronchoscopic evaluation for nonparenchymal pulmonary disorders served as controls .
These individuals had an average age of 28+8 yr. Bronchoalveolar lavage Informed consent was obtained from all patients and control subjects .
Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed as previously described ( 10 ) .
In all patients , a radiologically abnormal lung segment was lavaged when present , and the right middle lobe or lingula lavaged when the radio-graph was normal .
Total and differential cell counts and the evaluation of the expression of CD4 and CD8 surface antigens on T lymphocytes were performed as previously described ( 10 ) .
Separation of cell populations Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood by centrifuga-tion on Lympho-paque ( Nyegaard Co. , Oslo , Norway ) , and the cells were resuspended in 20 ml Hanks ' balanced salt medium with 0.08 % EDTA and centrifuged ( 100 g for 15 min ) two times to remove plate-lets .
T lymphocytes were isolated from concentrated fresh lavage cells by passage through nylon wool columns using previously described techniques ( 11 ) .
To isolate alveolar macrophages , concentrated lavage cells were suspended in complete medium containing 10 % human AB serum and transferred to bacteriologic petri dishes that had previously been incubated with human AB serum for 18 h at 4°C and subsequently washed two times with phosphate buffered saline ( 12 ) .
After a 60-min incubation at 37°C , nonadherent cells were removed and adherent cells were washed twice with complete medium and incubated for 30 min at 4°C in 10 ml Hanks ' balanced salt solution containing 0.2 % EDTA .
Cells which detached spontaneously or after gentle pipet-ting were recovered and washed in complete medium before use .
The viability of fresh cells recovered by lavage stained with acridine orange and ethidium bromide ( 13 ) was : controls , 86+2 % ( mean+SD ) ; tuberculosis , 81+14 % ; and sarcoidosis , 90+6 % .
The viability and purity of lavage T lymphocytes were respectively : controls , 99+1 % and 93+5 % ; tuberculosis , 96+5 % and 96+3 % ; and sarcoidosis , 98+1 % and 95+5 % .
The viability and purity of pulmonary macrophages from tuberculosis patients after separation by adherence were respectively 98+1 % and 97+4 % .
Metabolism of 25 ( OH ) D ; by cells in vitro To evaluate the capacity of cells to metabolize 25 ( OH ) D ; in vitro , 1 X 10° viable cells were preincubated for 15 min ( 37°C , 95 % air/5 % CO ; ) in a 2-cm diameter glass vial containing 1 ml of serum free Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 1.8 mM Ca®* and 0.9 mM phosphate ( Boehringer Mannheim GmbH , Penzberg , FRG ) .
10 l of ethanol was then added which contained either : ( a ) 50 nCi { 26,27°H ] 25 ( OH ) D ; ( Radiochemical Centre , Amersham , UK ; final concentration 2.5 X 107° M and final 20 Ci/mmol sp act ) ; or ( b ) 1 ug unlabeled 25 ( OH ) D ; ( Roussel-Uclaf Laboratories , Paris , France ) with or without 50 nCi [ PH ] 25 ( OH ) D ; ( final concentration 1 X 10~° M and final specific activity 20 mCi/mmo ! ) .
Incubation was continued for 150 min , after which 2 ml HPLC grade methanol and 2 ml chloroform were added to each sample , the vials agitated , the chloroform phase removed and dried under N ; , and the residue redissolved in chromatographic solvent ( see below ) .
Before chromatography , 100 ng unlabeled synthetic 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( Hoffmman-La Roche , Inc. , Nutley , NJ ) was added to extracts from cells incubated in the presence of 2.5 X 10~° M [ PH ] 25 ( OH ) D ; , and 10 nCi synthetic [ PH ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was added to those incubated with 1 x 10~° M unlabeled 25 ( OH ) D ; .
To quantify 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; production , samples were chromatographed using a » -hexane : isopropanol solvent system , and the metabolites comigrating with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; were rechromatographed using a methylene-chloride : isopropanol solvent system as previously described ( 5 ) .
Chromatography of samples on two successive systems was obligatory to isolate 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , since large amounts of ( 5E ) -19-nor-10-ox0-25 ( OH ) D ; were produced by the cells and comigrated with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in the first , but not the second chromatographic system ( data not shown ) .
For incubations performed in the presence of 2.5 X 10~° M PH ] -25 ( OH ) D ; , the rate of conversion of [ °H ] 25 ( OH ) D ; into [ °H ] -1,25 ( OH ) D ; was determined by calculating the percentage of total radioactivity with an appropriate elution profile after the two successive chromatographies .
Results are expressed as fmol/10° cells per 150 min , based on the assumption that the specific activity of the product was the same as that of the substrate ( see below ) .
Thus , conversion of 1 % of substrate into [ PH ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; corresponds to the production of 33 fmol .
All incubations and the subsequent purification of metabolite were performed in duplicate , and each value reported in the study represents the mean of duplicate determinations .
The interassay coefficient of variation of the duplicate determinations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was 25+4 % .
In preliminary experiments , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by lavage cells was demonstrated to be linear over the 150-min period studied .
Furthermore , < 15 % of [ PH ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; added to lavage cell incubations was consumed over the incubation period .
When medium without cells ( rn = 4 ) was incubated in the presence of 2.5 X 10~° M [ PH ] 25 ( OH ) D ; , 0-0.065 % isotope eluted with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
This background value has not been subtracted from the values reported for incubations containing cells .
| To measure the specific activity of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; produced in incubations containing 1 X 10~° M PH ] J25 ( OH ) D ; , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was purified as described above by sequential chromatography using the two different solvent systems and the absorbance at 254 nm and radioactivity of the isolated metabolite were determined .
Ultraviolet ( UV ) absorption spectra of the purified metabolite were obtained using a HPLC system fitted with a photodiode array detector ( model 990 ; Millipore/Continental Water Systems , St. Quentin en Welinnes , France ) .
Binding of 25 ( OH ) D ; metabolites to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors To characterize the ability of 25 ( OH ) D ; metabolites to bind to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors , metabolites produced in incubations containing 1 X 107° M 25 ( OH ) D ; were purified by successive chromatogra-phies , and tested for their ability to compete with synthetic [ PH ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for binding to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors present in chick intestinal cytosol as previously described ( 14 ) .
For samples incubated in the presence of PH ] J25 ( OH ) D ; , measurement of the quantity of metabolite present was based on radioactivity , assuming that the specific activity was the same as that of the 25 ( OH ) D ; substrate .
For samples incubated in the presence of unlabeled 25 ( OH ) D ; , measurement of the quantity of metabolite present was based on its absorbance at 254 nm .
Each sample was tested in duplicate at three different dilutions .
A standard curve was performed in parallel using known amounts of synthetic 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
The displacement of binding produced by the standards and experimental samples were each fitted to sigmoid curves and compared as previously described ( 15 ) using the Ligand program provided by these authors .
Statistical methods Results are expressed as mean+SD .
Comparison of the production of 25 ( OH ) D ; metabolites by the three study groups was performed by the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of ranks procedure , and comparisons between subgroups of patients within a given diagnostic category were performed using the Mann-Whitney test .
Correlations between the production of 25 ( OH ) D ; , metabolites and other metric variables were evaluated by linear regression .
In each case , a P < 0.05 was considered significant .
Results 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by lavage cells and blood mononuclear cells .
Fresh lavage cells from patients with tuberculosis incubated in the presence of 2.5 X 10~ M [ PH ] 25 ( OH ) D ; produced a metabolite which coeluted with [ PH ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in two successive chromatographic systems .
Further studies supported the conclusion that this metabolite was , in fact , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
When lavage cells from these patients were incubated in the presence of 10~° M 25 ( OH ) D ; and extracts chromatographed successively on the two HPLC systems , a 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; Production by Lung T Lymphocytes - 1589 metabolite coeluting with [ °H ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; could also be detected in all cases by monitoring absorbance , and this metabolite had the same capacity as synthetic 1,25 ( OH ) D ; to compete with [ °H ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for binding to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors and its UV spectrum had a maximum at 267 nm and a minimum at 228 nm , values identical to those observed for synthetic 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( data not shown ) .
Fresh lavage cells from tuberculosis patients produced 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in all cases , although the amounts of total 25 ( OH ) D ; converted into 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; varied over a 10-fold range ( Table I ) .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three of the five patients with tuberculosis tested also produced detectable amounts of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , but the production of this metabolite by blood mononuclear cells was always less than that produced by the same number of lavage cells from the same individual ( P < 0.05 by paired analysis ) .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by fresh lavage cells was correlated with the proportion of CD8* T lymphocytes present in the cell suspension ( Fig .
1 ; r = 0.67 , P < 0.005 ) , but not with the proportion of CD4* T lymphocytes , total lymphocytes or alveolar macrophages present ( data not shown ) .
The conversion of PH ] 25 ( OH ) D ; into [ °H } 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by lavage cells from patients with sarcoidosis was observed in two of six cases , but only small amounts were present ( Table I ) .
Thus , the production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by lavage cells from patients with sarcoidosis was significantly less than that of cells from patients with tuberculosis ( P < 0.001 ) .
No conversion of [ PH ] J25 ( OH ) D ; into [ °H ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was detected by blood mononuclear cells from the three sarcoid patients tested .
Simi-larly , lavage cells and blood mononuclear cells from controls did not produce detectable amounts of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Identification of cell types recovered by lavage from patients with tuberculosis capable of converting 25 ( OH ) D ; into 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages were the predominant cell types recovered by lavage from patients with tuberculosis , and in 7/12 individuals , these two cell types accounted for > 80 % of recovered cells .
To determine which of these cell types could produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , the two populations were separated and studied individually .

Additional experiments confirmed the identification of this metabolite as 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
First , purified T lymphocytes from the five tuberculosis patients incubated in the presence of unlabeled 1 xX 10~° M 25 ( OH ) D ; produced a metabolite detected by UV absorbance at 254 nm which coeluted with synthetic [ °H ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in the two sequential HPLC chromatographic systems .

It had the same capacity as synthetic 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to compete with [ °H ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for binding to receptors present in chick intestinal cytosol ( data not shown ) , as well as a UV spectrum identical to that of synthetic 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( Fig .

Third , the T lymphocytes used for these experiments had a purity of > 95 % , and therefore the incubations could have contained at most 5 X 10° other cell types , whereas incubations containing 10° alveolar macrophages or fresh lavage cells did not produce detectable amounts of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( data not shown ) .
Fourth , alveolar macrophages from one tuberculosis patient did not produce detectable amounts of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , although 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by unseparated cells from the same individual could be detected ( see below ) .
Alveolar macrophages .
When purified alveolar macrophages ( purity 97+4 % ) from patients with tuberculosis ( all of whose unseparated lavage cells produced 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ) were incubated in the presence of 2.5 X 10~° M [ PHJ } 25 ( OHM ) D ; production of [ PH ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was detectable in two cases , but not with cells from the third individual tested ( 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , production ; 9.3 , 4.0 , and 0 fmol/10° cells per 150 min ) .
The metabolite produced by alveolar macrophages from the two individuals that coeluted with synthetic 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was confirmed to have the properties expected for 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by the spectroscopic and receptor-binding methods described earlier ( data not shown ) .
The production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was directly related to the number of alveolar macrophages included in the incubation between 10° and 10° cells/incubation , but no conversion of [ °H ] 25 ( OH ) D ; into [ PH ] 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; could be detected in incubations containing < 10° macrophages ( data not shown ) .
Discussion The spontaneous production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by fresh ceils or tissue obtained from sites of granulomatous reactions in a small number of patients with sarcoidosis or tuberculosis has previously been reported , all of whom had obvious abnormalities in calcium metabolism ( 3-5 , 7 ) .
Our study extends these observations in several ways : ( a ) It suggests that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by immune and inflammatory cells is occurring in most patients with tuberculosis , and is not limited to the small proportion of patients with systemic abnormalities in calcium metabolism ( 5 ) .
( b ) It suggests that the production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is regulated differently in different granulomatous diseases , for production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by lavage cells was detectable in all 12 patients with tuberculosis tested , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; Production by Lung T Lymphocytes _ 1591 whereas 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , production was detectable in only two of the six patients with sarcoidosis and for both individuals only small amounts were produced .
( c ) This study demonstrates that production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is not restricted to sites of granulomatous lesions , because blood mononuclear cells from some patients with tuberculosis were capable of producing detectable amounts of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
The results presented here also define the cell types recovered by lavage that can contribute to the production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Our findings indicate that T lymphocytes recovered by lavage from patients with tuberculosis spontaneously produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
The production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; could not be explained by the nonspecific activation of the lymphocytes during the purification procedure , for none of the lavage T lymphocytes from patients with sarcoidosis and normals produced detectable 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
In addition , a variety of evidence indicated that the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; produced did not result from 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; produced by other cell types ( e.g. , alveolar macrophages ) contaminating the lymphocyte preparations .
It is noteworthy that the close correlation observed between 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by fresh lavage cells and purified lavage T lymphocytes from the same individual suggests that T lymphocytes are an important source of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; produced by lavage cells .
The production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by normal T lymphocytes has not been previously detected , although extrarenal production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; has been suggested to occur in patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma ( 19 ) , and HTLV1-transformed cord blood T lymphocytes have been reported to produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 20 ) .
It is noteworthy that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by lavage cells was correlated with the number of CD8* T lymphocytes present , but not with the number of CD4+* T lymphocytes , consistent with the possibility that CD8+* lymphocytes are the major source of this metabolite .
Other explanations are possible for the observed correlation however , such as the possibility that CD8* cells produce cyto-kines which stimulate 1 « -hydroxylase activity in other cells , or that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; favors the expansion of CD8* T lymphocytes ( 1 , 2 , 21 , 22 ) .
Even if CD8+* lymphocytes are directly involved in 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production , they must be activated to do so , since the proportion of CD8* T lymphocytes recovered by lavage from patients with sarcoidosis was not significantly different from that of patients with tuberculosis .
These studies also demonstrate for the first time that freshly purified alveolar macrophages from some tuberculosis patients can spontaneously produce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
In contrast , unfractionated lavage cells from patients with sarcoidosis ( containing a majority of alveolar macrophages in each case ) produced little or no 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , consistent with the previous observation that fresh alveolar macrophages from sarcoidosis patients produce little or no 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 7 ) .
Degradation of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by the cells can not explain these re-sults , because little apparent degradation of preformed 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was observed over the period of incubation .
Because changes in `` maturation '' or `` differentiation '' of alveolar macrophages by in vitro culture increases their capacity to produce this metabolite ( 22 ) , it is unclear whether the low 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by freshly isolated sarcoid alveolar macrophages reflects the fact that they are often relatively immature ( 23 ) , or reflects a basic difference in the production of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in tuberculosis and sarcoidosis .
In conclusion , this study indicates that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; pro 1592 Cadranel , Garabedian , Milleron , Guillozo , Akoun , and Hance duction occurs commonly in tuberculosis , and that T lymphocytes , possibly CD8+* T lymphocytes , are an important source of this mediator .
Because 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can improve the capacity of macrophages to kill mycobacteria ( 24-26 ) , our results support the conclusion that macrophage-lymphocyte in-teractions , mediated at least in part by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , may be an important component of a successful antituberculous immune response .
