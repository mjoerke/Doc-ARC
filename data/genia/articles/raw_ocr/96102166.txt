However , while IL2 expression requires the contribution of Ca*+*- and protein kinase C-dependent signals , we report that activation of human IL4 transcription through the Ca*+-dependent pathway is diminished by protein kinase C stimulation in Jurkat T cells .
This phenomenon is due to mutually exclusive binding of NF-AT , , and NF-xB to the P sequence , an element located 69 bp upstream of the IL4 transcription initiation site .
Human ZIL4 promoter-mediated transcription is downregulated in Jurkat cells stimulated with the NF- « B-activating cytokine tumor necrosis factor a and suppressed in RelA-overexpressing cells .
In contrast , protein kinase C stimulation or RelA overexpression does not affect the activity of a human ZL 4 promoter containing a mouse P sequence , which is a higher-affinity site for NF-AT , and a lower-affinity site for RelA .
Thus , competition between two general transcriptional activators , RelA and NF-AT , , mediates the inhibitory effect of protein kinase C stimulation on IL4 expression and may contribute to differential gene expression in Ty cells .
The detection of distinct lymphokine profiles in CD4* T cells has led to the definition of two functional subpopulations in rodents and in man ( 1 , 2 ) : T helper type 1 ( Tl ) cell clones synthesize interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and interferon y and play a critical role in the development of cell-mediated responses , whereas Ty2 clones , producing IL-4 and IL-5 among others , generally provide help for humoral immunity and are associated with the development of inflammatory reactions .
Central to this notion is the role of individual lymphokines that in turn regulate Ty1/Ty2 cell differentiation and function ( 3 ) .
Several studies implicate a role for differential signaling in the generation of Ty1l- and Ty2-related lymphokines ( 4-7 ) .
IL2 expression is mediated by the concomitant activation of Ca*+*+- and protein kinase C ( PKC ) -dependent pathways ( 4 ) .
On the other hand , while triggering of Ca**-mediated signals is sufficient for maximal ZL 4 transcription ( 5 , 6 ) , IL-4 secretion from human T cells can be downregulated following PKC stimulation ( 7 ) .
The diverging effects of PKC on IL2 and IL4 expression are presumably exerted at the transcriptional level .
The Ca *- and calcineurin-dependent factor NF-AT , ( 8 ) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of both of these lymphokine The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

11623 genes ( 9 , 10 ) .
NF-AT , activation is sufficient for maximal IL4 promoter activity ( 10 , 11 ) , whereas IL2 transcription also requires the involvement of PKC-dependent factors , such as AP-1 and NF-KB ( 4 , 12 , 13 ) .
To identify possible molecular mechanisms leading to mutually exclusive lymphokine expression in Ty cells , we compared the transcriptional activation of IL2 and IL4 promoter-driven reporter genes in the human T lymphoid cell line Jurkat stimulated with a Ca*+*-agonist and/or a PKC agonist .
The data show that PKC stimulation inhibits human IL4 transcription , which is , surprisingly , mediated by binding of the general activator NF- « B to the positive regulatory P sequence ( 14 ) .
NF-kB may , therefore , play an important role in Ty ] /Tn2 differentiation through a mechanism of competitive repression of NF-AT-dependent transcription .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Construction and Transfections .
L4 promoter fragments were generated by PCR and inserted into the HindIII and Xba I sites of pCAT-Basic ( Promega ) to construct the reporter plasmids pIL-4.741 , pIL-4.306 , pIL-4.95 , and pIL-4.65 .
The pIL-4.85 ( huP ) and pIL-4.85 ( muP ) plasmids were constructed by insertion into pCAT-Basic of PCR products generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pIL-4.95 .
The IL-2.15ACX reporter plasmid and the RelA and NFKBI1 expression plasmids have been described ( 9 , 15 ) .
Jurkat cells were transfected by 48-hr culture in RPMI 1640 containing Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) at 2.4-5.2 mg/ml and were stimulated 16-18 hr before harvest .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activity was assayed in cell lysates ( 16 ) .
Nuclear Extracts and Recombinant Proteins .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat cells ( 17 ) .
Recombinant NF-ATpXS ( 1-297 ) was expressed in bacteria as a hexahisti-dine-tagged protein and extracted as described ( 18 ) .
The procedure for bacterial expression and purification of RelA and NFKB1 proteins has been described ( 15 ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift Assay ( EMSA ) .
The following oligonucleotides and their complements were used : 5'-GTGTAACGAAAATTTCCAATGTAAAC-3 ' ( human P sequence , huP ) ( 14 ) and 5-GTGTAATAAAATTTTCCA-ATGTAAAC-3 ' ( mouse P sequence , muP ) ( 19 ) .

RESULTS PKC Stimulation Downregulates IL4 Promoter Activity .
We compared CAT transcription driven by the human IL2 and IL4 promoters ( 9 , 14 ) in Jurkat cells stimulated with the Ca*+* ionophore A23187 ( 0.5 uM ) and/or the PKC agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( `` 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate , '' TPA ) ( 20 ng/ml ) .
As previously shown ( 4 , 9 ) , activation of the IL2 promoter required treatment with both agents ( Fig .
14 ) .
In striking contrast , IL4 promoter activity , which was , as described ( 10 , 21 ) , maximally stimulated by A23187 , was inhibited by concomitant treatment with TPA ( Fig .
14 ) .
By use of a series of 5'-deletion reporter constructs , this effect of TPA was mapped to a region spanning bp -95 to -65 relative to the ZL4 transcription initiation site ( Fig .
1B ) .
This region contains the P sequence , an 11-bp element ( ~CGAAAATTTCC-® ) originally characterized as mediating inducible activity of the human IL4 promoter ( 14 ) .
Up to five similar elements have been described in the mouse IL4 promoter sharing the consensus sequence ATTTTCCNNT and binding the transcriptional complex NF ( P ) ( 21 ) .
NF-xB Binds to the P Sequence upon PKC Stimulation .
To identify possible factors mediating the inhibitory effect of PKC on IL4 promoter activity , we analyzed complex formation on a human P sequence probe in EMSAs using extracts from Jurkat cells stimulated with A23187 ( 0.5 wM ) and/or TPA ( 20 A 10 C Control g - ® TPA & & ] A23187 2 = A23187/TPA Nud 0 53 `` C & m 3 LL , IL-2 .

In agreement with previous reports ( 11 , 14 ) , a se-quence-specific NF ( P ) complex formed with extracts from unstimulated cells ( Fig .
24 , lane 1 ) .
This complex was enhanced by treatment with A23187 ( lane 2 ) , whereas cotreat-ment with TPA resulted in the appearance of an additional complex of higher mobility ( lane 3 ) .
The formation of both complexes was inhibited when the NF- « B elements from the mouse « -chain enhancer ( IgxB ) ( 22 ) ( Fig .
2B , lane 5 ) and from the simian virus 40 early promoter ( AP-3 ) ( 23 ) ( lane 6 ) were used as competitors .
However , in EMSAs using specific antisera ( Fig .
2C ) , the NF ( P ) complex was found to contain NF-AT , and/or antigenically related factor ( s ) ( lane 2 ) , whereas antisera specific for the NF- « B components RelA ( lane 3 ) and NFKB1 ( lane 4 ) interfered with formation of the TPA-inducible complex .
Based on this finding , the two complexes will be referred to as `` NF-AT '' and `` NF-kB '' , respectively .
The NF-AT complex can be resolved into two discrete bands ( Fig .
2 B and C ) , which are , however , similar to each other for sequence specificity and immunoreactivity and presumably contain distinct NF-ATp-related molecular species ( 18 , 24 ) .
Also shown are additional `` high-mobility complexes '' ( HMC ) ( 14 ) of unclear specificity , whose formation is not apparently affected by cell stimulation ( Fig .
24 ) .
In agreement with previous reports ( 10 , 25 ) , none of the complexes described appeared to contain AP-1-related factors ( Fig .
2B ) .
IL4 Promoter Activity Is Repressed by NF- « B .
Thus , PKC-mediated downregulation of human IL4 transcription is paralleled by the formation of an alternative complex , containing NF- « B , on the P sequence .
Tumor necrosis factor « ( TNF-a , 20 ng/ml ) , which activates NF- « B by inducing proteolysis of the inhibitor protein IxBa ( 26 ) , substantially decreased A23187-induced IL4 promoter activity while increasing the activity of the human IL2 promoter ( Fig .
34 ) .
Furthermore , cotransfection with a RelA expression plasmid , alone or in combination with NFKB1 ( 15 ) , decreased IL4 transcription by 80 % in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3B ) , while not affecting or moderately increasing IL2 transcription ( data not shown ) .
This was surprising since RelA , either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with NFKB1 ( 20 ) , usually functions as a transcriptional activator of mammalian genes ( 27 ) .
On the other hand , overexpression of NFKB1 alone resulted in increased IL4 promoter activity ( Fig .
3B ) .
Taken together , these data suggested that NF-AT displacement from the P sequence by RelA could be one mechanism by which TPA and TNF-a repress Ca**-mediated IL4 promoter activity .
In support of this view , NF-AT complex formation was consistently decreased by coincubation of a P-sequence probe with recombinant RelA ( 15 ) and either crude extracts ( data not shown ) or a recombinant NF-AT , fragment-NFATpXS ( 1-297 ) -including the minimal region required for specific DNA binding ( 18 ) ( Fig .
3C ) .
Similar results were obtained with recombinant RelA-NFKB1 heterodimers ( data not shown ) , but not with NFKB1 homodimers ( Fig .
3D ) .
The Mouse P Sequence Is a Lower-Affinity Binding Site for NF-xB .
In recent studies of mouse IL4 , TPA did not affect promoter activity ( 10 , 21 ) and did not induce NF- « B complex formation on the P sequence ( 19 ) .
Indeed , the human and mouse P sequences differ by two potentially critical nucleotides ( Fig .
44 ) : ( ? )
an A - > G transition in position -78 makes the human P sequence more similar to a consensus NF-KB site , such as PRD-II of the interferon-B gene ( 28 ) , the highest-affinity site known for RelA homodimers ( 20 ) , and ( # ) an A to T transversion in position -74 makes the mouse P sequence more similar to other NF-AT , -binding sites , such as the mouse IL2 distal NF-AT site ( 29 ) .
To assess the possible impact of these divergences , oligonucleotides including a mouse or human P sequence were generated for use in EMSAs with extracts from Jurkat cells stimulated with A23187 and TPA .

However , their relative intensities indicated preferential NF-AT binding to the mouse P sequence and preferential NF- « B binding to the human P sequence ( Fig .

This was confirmed by Scatchard analysis of the binding of recombinant RelA and NFATpXS ( 1-297 ) to the two probes ( Fig .

The mouse P sequence is , in fact , a higher-affinity binding site for NF-AT , ( K4 = 128 pM ) and a lower-affinity site for RelA ( Kq = 526 pM ) than its human counterpart ( K4 = 535 and 116 pM , respectively ) .

To assess the functional significance of characterized as an NF-AT , binding site that , unlike the IL2 these findings , the human IL4 reporter construct pIL- NF-AT sites ( 13 ) , does not bind this factor as a complex with 4.85 ( huP ) was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to generate AP-1 ( 10 ) .
This explains why Ca*+-dependent activation of pIL-4.85 ( muP ) , where the human P sequence was converted to NF-AT , is sufficient for maximal ZL 4 promoter activity ( 10 , 11 , the mouse P sequence in an otherwise isogenic plasmid .
As 21 ) , whereas PKC stimulation is also required for IL2 tran-expected , transcriptional activation of pIL-4.85 ( muP ) was scriptional activation ( 4 , 9 ) .
However , AP-1 proteins can consistently less sensitive than pIL-4.85 ( huP ) to RelA overex- interact with critical elements in the mouse ZL4 promoter ( 21 , pression ( Fig .
5B ) and was not affected by PKC stimulation 30 , 31 ) .
It has been recently shown that AP-1 and NF-AT can ( Fig .
5C ) .
cooperatively activate the transcription of reporter genes driven by composite OAP4p/P sequence repeats ( 31 ) .
The data presented in this report provide a second expla-DISCUSSION nation for differential signaling requirements for IL2 and IL4 Here we show that the inhibitory effect of PKC stimulation on expression in Ty cells and suggest that the NF- « B component IL4 expression in human T lymphocytes ( 7 ) is exerted at the RelA mediates the inhibitory effect of PKC activation on transcriptional level and identify the P sequence as the critical human IL4 transcription .
Our conclusions are supported by element mediating this phenomenon .

Immunology : Casolaro et al .
PKC stimulation ( 22 ) bind to the human P sequence with higher affinity than NF-AT , ( Figs .
2 and 4 ) ; ( i ) RelA represses human IL4 promoter activity and displaces NF-AT , from complexes formed on the human P sequence ( Fig .
3 ) ; and ( # ? )
replacement of the human P sequence with a site binding RelA with lower affinity and NF-AT , with higher affinity , such as the mouse P sequence ( Fig .
4 ) , abrogates the inhibitory effect of PKC stimulation on promoter activity ( Fig .
5 ) .
We define the P sequence as a shared binding site for NF-AT and Rel family members .
Previous studies have shown that NF- « B can bind to the human P sequence ( 14 , 25 ) .
The binding of NF-AT-like proteins to NF- « B elements has been described as well ( 8 , 32 ) .
This is not surprising , inasmuch as the core NF-AT , -binding GGAA tetranucleotide ( 8 , 29 ) is also part of most NF-kB sites ( 27 ) , and the DNA-binding domains of different NF-AT and Rel family members are highly related ( 18 , 24 ) .
We identified critical base divergences in the human and mouse P sequences that account for preferential NF-AT , or RelA binding when both factors are activated ( Fig .
4 ) .
Indeed , RelA can compete with NF-AT , for binding to the human , but not mouse , P sequence .
Although our findings do not support a direct role of NF- « B in mouse IL4 transcription , residual NF- « B complex formation on the mouse P sequence ( Fig .
4B ) and inhibition of promoter constructs containing the mouse P sequence in RelA-overexpressing cells ( Fig .
5B ) imply that additional factors may promote NF- « B binding to an otherwise low-affinity site under some circumstances in vivo .
One possible candidate is the chromosomal protein high-mobility group ( HMG ) I ( Y ) , which enhances interferon B promoter activity by favoring NF-kB binding to the PRD-II site ( 15 ) .
In support of this view , HMG I ( Y ) can bind to the mouse P sequence and downregulate mouse IL4 promoter activity ( 30 ) .
Two Rel family members exert opposite effects on the regulation of ZL2 and IL4 transcription .
Remarkably , RelA , a general transcriptional activator ( 27 ) , acts as a repressor of human IL4 promoter activity , whereas it plays a permissive role in IL2 transcription ( 12 ) .
We also show that NFKB1 , which reportedly represses IL 2 promoter activity ( 33 ) , is an IL4 promoter activator ( Fig .
3B ) .
Overexpression of NFKB1 ho-modimers , with decreased formation of RelA-NFKB1 het-erodimers , occurs upon induction of cellular tolerance in vitro ( 34 ) .
T-cell tolerance in vivo is accompanied by preferential IL4 expression ( 35 ) .
Similarly , cAMP accumulation in T cells results in increased expression of Ty2-related lymphokines and decreased IL2 expression , as well as decreased RelA activation ( 36 ) .
Finally , the lack of IL2 transcription in mouse Ty2 clones has been related to the failure to generate active NF- « B heterodimers ( 37 ) .
Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that this phenomenon could be associated with derepression of IL4 and other Ty2-related genes and indicate NF- « B as a possible mediator of mutually exclusive IL-2 and IL-4 synthesis in Ty cells .
