Although GM-CSF receptor is devoid of tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity , GM-CSF-induced peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) functional activation is mediated by the phosphorylation of a large number of intracellular signaling molecules .
We have previously shown that JAK2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to GM-CSF in PMN .
In the present study we demonstrate that also the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) family members STAT1 p91 and STAT3 p92 and the product of the c-fps/fes protooncogene become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon GM-CSF stimulation and physically associated with both GM-CSF receptor B common subunit and JAK2 .
Moreover GM-CSF was able to induce JAK2 and p93 ' '' '' catalytic activity .
We also demonstrate that the association of the GM-CSF receptor B common subunit with JAK2 is ligand-dependent .
Finally we demonstrate that GM-CSF induces a DNA-binding complex that contains both p91 and p92 .
These results identify a new signal transduction pathway activated by GM-CSF and provide a mechanism for rapid activation of gene expression in GM-CSF-stimulated PMN .
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) regulates proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic progenitor cells and functionally activates polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) ( 1 ) .
In particular , GM-CSF exerts several direct actions on neutrophils , including stimulation of changes in surface expression of both chemotactic receptors and adherence proteins ( 2-5 ) , as well as hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils adhered to extracellular matrix components ( 6 , 7 ) .

More recently it has been reported that GM-CSF inhibits programmed cell death both in human eosinophils and neutrophils ( 15 ) and that this effect is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates ( 15 ) .
All GM-CSF effects are mediated by a heterodimeric receptor comprised of a ligand binding subunit , denoted a ( 16 ) , and of a transducing subunit designated as B ( 17 ) , which is also shared with interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) ( 17 ) and IL-5 receptor ( 18 ) .
Although GM-CSF receptor does not possess an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain , several lines of evidence indicate that signaling processes initiated by ligand binding to the receptor induce activation of cellular tyrosine kinases ( 19 ) .
Studies on the biochemical interaction involved in signaling from the GM-CSF receptor have demonstrated that a number of transducing molecules such as She ( 20-22 ) , Grb2 ( 20 ) , Sos1 ( 20 ) , Ras ( 23 ) , Raf-1 ( 24 ) , and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( 25 ) become activated upon GM-CSF stimulation .
It has also been reported that a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase , the c-fps/fes protooncogene prod-uct , is phosphorylated in response to GM-CSF ( 26 ) .
More recently the receptor-associated protein JAK2 ( 27 , 28 ) has been reported to be rapidly phosphorylated upon GM-CSF receptor activation ( 29 , 30 ) .
Recent data suggest that at least two components of latent cytoplasmic proteins termed signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT 's ) ( 31 ) , which become activated upon ligand binding , are substrates of JAK family members ( 32-34 ) .
In order to characterize the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins involved in GM-CSF-mediated PMN activation , we examined the role of two STAT proteins , STAT1I a ( p91 ) and STAT3 ( p92 ) and of c-fps/fes protooncogene product ( p93 '' ® ) in this process .
We demonstrate that , upon GM-CSF stimulation , both STAT proteins and p93/* '' become tyrosine-phosphorylated and physically associate with GM-CSF receptor B common subunit as well as with JAK2 .
GM-CSF stimulation was also able to induce p93 '' and JAK2 catalytic activity .
Moreover we demonstrate that , as previously reported for erythropoietin receptor ( 35 ) , JAK2 association with the B common subunit is ligand-dependent .
Finally we demonstrate that the DNA-binding proteins p91 and p92 are early targets of the GM-CSF-induced DNA-binding complex .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION GM-CSF plays an important role in host defense by enhance-ing the functional activities of mature leukocytes and , in particular , neutrophils ( 2-14 ) .
The binding of GM-CSF to its heterodimeric receptor , which is devoid of intrinsic kinase activity , leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates ( 19 ) .
It has been reported that , in growth factor-dependent cell lines , JAK2 is constitutively associated with the B subunit ( 29-30 ) .
Moreover JAK2 has been shown to be phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation not only in proliferating cells but also in PMN and eosinophils functionally activated by GM-CSF ( 30 ) and IL-5 ( 38 ) , respectively .
Moreover , a ligand-dependent association of JAK2 with erythropoietin receptor has also been reported ( 35 ) .
To further elucidate the interaction between the B subunit and JAK2 we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in unstimulated and GM-CSF-stimulated PMN .
The results , reported in Fig .
1 , demonstrate that in PMN p130 JAK2 physically associates with the B subunit only upon GMCSF stimulation , suggesting that , under physiological condi-tions , the association between JAK2 and the receptor may not be constitutive .
Kinetic analysis of JAK2 activation , upon GMCSF stimulation , reported in Fig .

band of phosphotyrosine-containing protein ( s ) of approximately 90 kDa ( Fig .
2 ) .
It is known that among the STAT proteins STAT1 and STAT3 exhibit a molecular mass of 91 and 92 kDa , respectively .
Therefore we sought to determine whether the JAK2 co-precipitating p90 phosphoprotein ( s ) included one or both STAT 's .
It has also been demonstrated that a p93 myeloid-specific protein , the product of the protooncogene c-fps/fes , becomes phosphorylated and associated to the GMCSF receptor B common subunit upon GM-CSF stimulation in a growth factor-dependent cell line ( 26 ) .
Therefore , we tried to assess whether p93° '' was also included in JAK2 co-precipitating p90 phosphoprotein ( s ) .
To test these possibilities we first evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of p91 , p92 , and p93 '' upon GM-CSF stimulation .
As shown in Fig .
3 , both STAT proteins , p91 and p92 , and p93/** become phosphorylated after 5 min of GM-CSF treatment .
In addition , in the anti-p91 and -p92 immunoprecipitates together with the marked band of approximately 90 kDa a faint band of approximately 130 kDa was detected .
Taken together these results strongly suggest that at least the two STAT proteins physically associated with JAK2 .
To confirm this hypothesis , anti-JAK2 co-immunopre-cipitates from unstimulated and GM-CSF-stimulated PMN were divided into four aliquots , resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and independently blotted with the antibodies of interest .
In the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot reported in Fig .

ity of anti-JAK1 antiserum to co-immunoprecipitate these proteins ( data not shown ) .
Moreover the correlation between the biochemical events induced by GM-CSF stimulation and its biological effects on PMN was supported by the observation that , upon IL-3 stimulation , neither functional activation ( data not shown ) or protein tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates ( Fig .
5 ) .
The observation that JAK2 physically associates with the 8 common subunit as well as with p91 and p92 STATs and p9 % ¥® '' implies that the latter three proteins are also directly or indirectly , via JAK2 , associated with the B common .
To evaluate this hypothesis anti-beta co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed .
The anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot of anti-§ common immunoprecipitates from unstimulated and GM-CSF-stimulated PMN , shown in Fig .
6A , demonstrates the presence of approximately 90-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein ( s ) only in GM-CSF-stimulated cells .
Moreover when aliquots of the same samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and independently blotted with the anti-p91 ( Fig .
6B ) , anti-p92 ( Fig .
6C ) , and anti-p93 % ®® ( Fig .
6D ) antibodies , the two STAT proteins together with the were found to be physically associated , upon ligand binding , with the B common subunit .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of various tyrosine kinases is commonly associated with the activation of their catalytic activity ( 53 ) .
An in vitro kinase assay was performed to examine whether phosphorylation of JAK2 and p93/*® correlates with their intrinsic kinase activity .
As shown in Fig .
7 , anti-JAK2 ( panel A ) and anti-p93'®® ( panel B ) immunoprecipitates from GM-CSF-stimulated , but not from IL-3-stimulated , PMN have a detectable in vitro kinase activity .
PMN are terminally differentiated cells and do not undergo proliferation ; however , tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates has been implicated in a number of functional activities such as superoxide anion production ( 54-58 ) ; regulation of integrin surface expression , leading to adherence of PMN to endothelial cells ( 59 ) ; regulation of microvascular per-meability , leading to migration of PMN into inflammatory tissue ( 60 , 61 ) ; and modulation of apoptotic process ( 15 ) .
The role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in physiological agonist-mediated or GM-CSF-mediated PMN activation is further supported by the observation that PMN biological responses are prevented by the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( 15 , 55 , 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 3566 Signaling in PMN Functional Activation A B Competitor - - 4 + HEPG2 P M N mt im - -- -- -- 43 PI pS2 PL PI PI p92 - ® < -- » a- # q =p J !

Nuclear extracts from 15-min GM-CSF-treated PMN or IL-6-treated HEPG2 cells were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with preimmune serum ( P7 ) , anti-p91 antiserum , or anti-p92 antibodies before incubation with radiolabeled oligonucleotide and separated on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
The IL-6-and GM-CSF-induced DNA-protein complexes and the supershifted specie are indicated .

It has been shown that , in PMN , GM-CSF causes a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular molecules including both 90- and 130-kDa proteins ( 15 , 55 , 62 , 63 ) .
In agreement with these findings , the present study demonstrates that a set of 90-kDa proteins namely STAT1 , STAT3 , and p93 and a 130-kDa protein , identified as JAK2 , become phosphorylated upon GM-CSF stimulation .
Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that at least some PMN functional activities may be regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway .
It has been reported that treatment of cells with different cytokines results in rapid STAT protein phosphorylation .
Activated STATs ( one or more ) form dimers that migrate in the nucleus and form stable complexes with specific DNA sequences ( response elements ) and stimulate transcription ( 31 ) .
Three discrete complexes between activated STAT proteins and DNA response elements have been demonstrated upon EGF treatment ( 50 ) .
These complexes seem to be formed by STAT1 or STAT3 homodimers or by heterodimers between the two STATs ( 50 ) .
In contrast , in interferon-y- ( 44 ) , IL-6- ( 50 ) , and GM-CSF-treated cells ( 51 ) , only one complex can be detected containing either the STAT1 ( 45 ) or the STAT3 homodimers ( 51 ) .
The rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p91 and p92 observed in GM-CSF-stimulated PMN led us to evaluate , by gel retardation assay , the formation of DNA-protein complexes in nuclear extract of untreated and treated cells .
As shown in Fig .
8A , both in IL-6-treated HEPG2 cells and in GM-CSF-treated PMN a DNA-protein complex appears .
Moreover when the same nuclear extracts were incubated with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide , both the IL-6- and GM-CSF -induced complexes are competed ( Fig .
8A ) demonstrating its sequence specificity .
Moreover it is also clear that the DNA-binding complex observed in IL-6-stimulated HEPG2 cells shows a slower migration than that observed in GM-CSF-stimulated PMN .
It has been reported that in HEPG2 cells IL-6 induces only the formation of a major complex , defined also as SIF-A ( 40 , 45 ) , corresponding to the complex containing p92 homodimers ( 50 ) .
In contrast , EGF-activated proteins have been shown to form three complexes , designated as SIF-A , SIF-B , and SIF-C ( 50 ) , with the serum-inducible element of c-fos ( in its mutated , hyperactive form ) ( 40 , 45 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that the faster migrating complex observed in GM-CSF-stimulated PMN contains either STATI-STAT3 heterodimers and/or STAT1 homodimers .
We thus tested the GM-CSF-induced complex for reactivity with anti-STAT1 p91 and anti-STAT3 p92 antibodies .
As shown in Fig .
8B , when anti-p91 and anti-p92 antisera were added to GM-CSF -treated nuclear extract , a new band , which was not present in the binding reaction with preimmune serum , appeared in the upper part of the gel , thus demonstrating the formation of a supershifted species .
A supershifted species appears also when nuclear extract from IL-6-stimulated HEPG2 cells was preincubated with anti-p92 antiserum ( Fig .
8B ) The presence of the supershifted complex observed both in anti-p91 and anti-p92-pretreated nuclear extract suggests that , in PMN , GM-CSF can rapidly modulate gene expression by the induction of a DNA-binding complex containing p91 and p92 heterodimer .
It has been shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are involved in GM-CSF-mediated PMN functional activation and c-fos gene transcription ( 55 ) .
Moreover the role of tyrosine kinases in controlling GM-CSF-induced c-fos gene expression in PMN , has been demonstrated by the use of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( 55 ) .
Our finding that at least two of the STAT proteins that become phosphorylated upon GM-CSF stimulation are involved in the formation of a complex with the serum-inducible elements of c-fos , supports the hypothesis that GMCSF can regulate the transcription of this gene via STAT1 and STAT3 activation .
In conclusion , our study demonstrates that in PMN both STAT1 p91 and STAT3 p92 and the myeloid-specific p93/* become phosphorylated upon GM-CSF stimulation and are co-immunoprecipitated by anti-JAK2 and anti-B common subunit antibodies , and that GM-CSF induces the formation of a DNA-protein complex containing both p91 and p92 .
The redundancy of growth factors inducing the same DNA-responsive element to stimulate both cell proliferation and functional activation raises the question of how their specificity can be determined .
The answer could be obtained by the identification of more genes whose transcription can be activated by the binding of known or unknown proteins .
