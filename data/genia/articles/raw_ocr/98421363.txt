RAPID COMMUNICATION Expression Status of BCL-6 and Syndecan-1 Identifies Distinct Histogenetic Subtypes of Hodgkin 's Disease By Antonino Carbone , Annunziata Gloghini , Gianluca Gaidano , Silvia Franceschi , Daniela Capello , Hans G. Drexler , Brunangelo Falini , and Riccardo Dalla-Favera The tumor cells in most cases of Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) have been recently recognized to originate from the B-cell lineage , but their precise differentiation stage is not fully clarified .
Recently , we have reported that the histogenesis of B-cell lymphomas may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of BCL-6 , a transcription factor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B cells , and CD138/ syndecan-1 ( syn-1 ) , a proteoglycan associated with post-GC , terminal B-cell differentiation .
In this study , we have applied these tw o markers to the study of HD histogenesis .
We have found that in nodular lymphocyte predominance HD ( NLPHD ) tumor cells consistently display the BCL-6+/syn-1~ phenotype , indicating their derivation from GC B cells .
Conversely , classic HD ( CHD ) is ODGKIN®S DISEASE ( HD ) is characterized histologi-cally by scanty neoplastic cells interspersed in the context of a reactive cellular background . '' ''
Based on the characteristics of neoplastic cells and of the reactive background , HD is distinguished into two major categories termed nodular lymphocyte predominance HD ( NLPHD ) and classic HD ( CHD ) .
Whereas NLPHD generally follows an indolent course , CHD is fatal without therapy.3* The detailed characterization of the HD neoplastic population has been a matter of debate for many years . ''
Recently , single-cell analysis of Ig genes has shown that tumor cells of NLPHD and of most CHD of B-cell lineage derive from germinal center ( GC ) B cells that have been stimulated and selected by antigen . '' ''

0006-4971/98/9207-0055 $ 3.00/0 2220 heterogeneous because the tumor cells of a fraction of CHD display the BCL-6-/syn-1* phenotype of post-GC B-cells , whereas another fraction of CHD is constituted by a mixture of tumor cells reflecting the GC ( BCL-6+/syn-1~ ) or post-GC ( BCL-6-/ syn-1+* ) phenotypes .
BCL-6~/syn-1+* tumor cells of CHD are mostly found surrounded by T cells expressing CD40L , consistent with the observation that CD40 signaling downregulates BCL-6 expression .
These data indicate that tumor cells of NLPHD uniformly display a GC B-cell phenotype , whereas the phenotype of tumor cells of CHD appears to be modulated by the surrounding cellular background , particularly CD4O0L+ reactive T cells .

and neoplastic cells of NLPHD , known as lymphocytic and histiocytic ( L & H ) cells , differ markedly in terms of morphol-ogy , phenotype , and infection pattern by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
' > Whereas the features of L & H cells are relatively homogeneous , RS cells of CHD display a high degree of polymorphism which remains unexplained . ''
Progression of normal GC B cells to later stages of B-cell differentiation may be monitored by following the expression of biologic markers associated specifically with distinct subsets of mature B cells .
We have recently shown that expression of BCL-6 and CD138/syndecan-1 ( syn-1 ) can reliably discriminate between GC and post-GC B cells . ' ''
The BCL-6 protein is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor encoded by the BCL-6 proto-oncogene and implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell diffuse large cell lymphoma ( B-DLCL ) . ''
The BCL-6 protein is expressed by GC B cells and is required for GC formation and function .
' > 4 Conversely , expression of BCL-6 is negative in all other stages of B-cell differentiation , including virgin and memory B cells as well as plasma cells . ''
Challenging of GC B cells either with antigen or through the CD40/CD4O0L pathway causes downregulation of BCL-6 .
' 5 '' Similarly , induction of the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) downregulates expression of BCL-6 in B cells reflecting the GC phenotype . ''
Syn-1 is a proteoglycan belonging to the syndecan family , which mediates cell-to-extracellular matrix interac-tions . ''
Among mature B cells , syn-1 is expressed in post-GC B cells , including immunoblasts and plasma cells , whereas it is absent in GC B cells. ! ''
Here we report data suggesting a histogenetic model for HD development .
Tumor cells of NLPHD consistently express the BCL-6+*/syn-1~ phenotype and thus closely reflect GC B cells .
Conversely , the majority of CHD display only or predominantly BCL-6~/syn-1 * RS cells .
The HD variants identified by BCL-6 and syn-1 differ in terms of amount and distribution of CD4O0L * reactive T lymphocytes , suggesting that interactions between CD40 ( on neoplastic cells ) and CD4O0L ( on reactive T cells ) is a crucial event in modulating the differentiation stage and phenotype of HD .

BCL-6 AND Syn-1 EXPRESSION ON RS CELLS OF HD MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples The study was based on 53 HD cases for which frozen tissue samples were available .
The HD panel included 10 NLPHD ( all B-cell pheno-type ) and 43 CHD ( 31 nodular sclerosis and 12 mixed cellularity ) with B-cell ( n = 10 ) or undetermined ( n = 33 ) phenotype ( Table 1 ) .
NLPHD was diagnosed according to morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria .
The CD30+ , CD45~ , CD15+ , EMA~ ( epithelial membrane antigen ) diagnostic profile was required for the diagnosis of CHD . !
The Rye modification of the Lukes and Butler classification was used to classify the histologic subtypes of CHD . ''
Frozen and/or paraffin-embedded tissues from 12 clinical samples with nonneoplastic lymphoid proliferations were also included in the study .
Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) IHC was performed with the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase ( APAAP ) method as described .
`` * The protocol used for each antigen tested is described below .
Negative control experiments , which were invariably negative , consisted of omission of the primary antibody , substitution with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , or staining with irrelevant isotype-matched mouse Ig .
BCL-6 protein .
The BCL-6 protein was detected by the PG-B6 monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) that has been recently generated in the laboratory of one of the investigators ( B.F. ) by immunizing BALB/c mice with a glutathione S-transferase-BCL-6 fusion protein . ''
Immunostaining for BCL-6 was performed on frozen or formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded sections by the APAAP method . ''
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were pretreated in a microwave oven ( Jet 900 W ; Philips , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) for 30 minutes at 250 W in EDTA solution ( 0.05 mmol ; pH 8 ) .
Syn-1 antigen .
- Anti-B-B4 MoAb ( Serotec , Oxford , UK ) , which specifically recognizes the syn-1 antigen , '' '' was applied to frozen tissues from all HD cases .
For morphologic control purposes , the MoAb was also applied to paraffin-embedded tissues from a representative subset of HD cases ( NLPHD , 4 cases ; nodular sclerosis CHD , 15 cases ; mixed cellularity CHD , 6 cases ) .
Immunohistochemistry for syn-1 was performed as previously described . ''
CD40 and CD4OL .
- Anti-CD40 MoAb 89 ( kindly provided by Dr J. Bancherau , Centre de Recherche , Schering-Plough , Dardilly , France ) was applied to paraffin-embedded tissue sections from all HD cases .
Anti-CD40L MoAb M90 ( Genzyme Diagnostic , Cambridge , MA ) was applied to frozen sections from all cases included in the study because of its lack of reactivity in paraffin embedded tissue sections .
Lineage assignment .
| Further immunophenotyping and lineage assignment of HD cases was performed with antibodies against conventional B- and T-cell-associated antigens , as reported in detail previously . ''
Assessment of BCL-6 and syn-1 Staining in HD Samples At least 100 neoplastic cells per section , as defined by histologic and immunohistologic criteria ( CD30 positivity ) , were independently counted by two of us ( A.C. , A.G. ) .
The percentage of BCL-6* or syn-1* neoplastic cells was assigned into one of the following categories : 0 , < 10 % , 10 % to 25 % , 25 % to 50 % , 50 % to 75 % , and > 75 % .
Only definite and unambiguous staining on unequivocally malignant cells was accepted as positive .
Two-Color Staining Multiple immunocytochemical staining was performed to detect BCL-6 plus syn-1 and BCL-6 plus LMP-1 in selected HD samples as previously described , '' with minor modifications .
Briefly , frozen section were cut and fixed in acetone-chloroform ( 1:1 ) solution for 5 minutes and stored at -80°C until use .
Slides were then brought to room temperature ( RT ) , fixed in acetone for 5 minutes at RT , air dried , fixed in buffered 10 % formalin for 10 minutes at RT , rinsed in PBS pH 2221 Table 1 .

2222 7.4 , preincubated with normal rabbit serum ( Dakopatts A/S , Glostrup , Denmark ) for 5 minutes at RT , and incubated with MoAb BCL-6 ( undiluted , with the addition of 3 % normal human serum ) for 1 hour at RT .
After washing in 0.05 mol/L Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ) pH 7.5 , they were fixed in cold methanol at -20°C for 10 minutes and then immunostained by the APAAP method '' using naphthol AS-MX phosphate along with fast blue BB salt ( Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis , MO ) for the development of alkaline phosphatase .
Subsequently , sections were treated twice for 5 minutes in citrate buffer ( pH 6 ) in a microwave oven to denature bound antibody molecules and to inacti-vate alkaline phosphatase present in the APAAP complex .
Finally , sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-syn-1 MoAb or anti-LMP-1 MoAb and immunostained by the APAAP method using naphthol AS-MX phosphate along with fast red TR salt ( Sigma ) for the development of alkaline phosphatase .
Multiple immunocytochemical staining was also performed to detect CD40L plus BCL-6 and CD4O0L plus syn-1 in selected HD samples .
Double-immunostaining assays were performed on frozen sections using CD4OL as first antibody .
These experiments were performed following the above-described method with the exception that the CD40L MoAb was applied after the fixation in methanol .
To define the relative abundance of CD40L+* lymphocytes in the reactive background of HD , a semi-quantitative analysis was per-formed .
In each case analyzed , the number of CD40L * lymphocytes directly surrounding ( ie , rosetting ) each RS cell was calculated on a total of 100 to 200 RS cells counted .
Analysis of Viral Infection All HD samples included in this study were subjected to determination of tumor infection by EBV .
EBER in situ hybridization ( ISH ) studies were performed on HD samples to identify the nature and distribution of EBV-infected cells . ''
In all the samples , immunostaining for LMP-1 was performed with an LMP-1 specific antibody ( Dakopatts A/S ) on Bouin or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections , as described above .
The percentage of LMP-1* neoplastic cells was assigned to one of the following categories : 0 , < 10 % , 10 % to 25 % , 25 % to 50 % , 50 % to 75 % , and > 75 % .
Cell Lines The characteristics of the human CHD cell lines L-428 , KM-H2 , SUP-HD1 , SBH-1 , CO , HD-MY-Z , HDLM-2 , and L-540 were described in detail previously. ? ''
CHD-derived cell lines were obtained through the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures ( Braunschweig , Germany ) .
Cytospin preparations of HD-derived cell lines were fixed in acetone-chloroform at room temperature for 10 minutes and immunostained with BCL-6 and anti-B-B4 MoAbs by the APAAP method . ''
Genetic Studies of BCL-6 The presence of mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions was tested by two independent methods , including polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR-SSCP ) and DNA CARBONE ET AL direct sequencing .
PCR-SSCP analysis of BCL-6 5° noncoding regions was performed on three partially overlapping PCR fragments ( E1.10 , E1.11 , E1.12 ) spanning 739 bp .
This 739-bp DNA fragment is located downstream of the first BCL-6 noncoding exon and has been shown to harbor greater than 95 % of BCL-6 5 ' mutations detected in B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas.3 % ' DNA direct sequencing was performed on a unique PCR product encompassing fragments E1.10 , E1.11 , and E1.12 using a commercially available kit ( Thermosequenase ; Amer-sham Life Sciences , Amersham , UK ) .
Mutations were investigated in CHD cell lines and , for comparative purposes , in B-cell lymphomas known to derive from the GC , including 102 cases of B-DLCL and 20 cases of follicular lymphoma ( FL ) .
The gross configuration of BCL-6 alleles was explored by Southern blot hybridization using probes that recognize the cluster of BCL-6 rearrangements detected in B-cell lymphoma . ''
Quantitative analysis of the hybridization signal was performed using a Molecular Imager System ( Biorad , Hercules , CA ) .
Statistical Methods Difference in rosetting of CD4O0L* T cells by BCL-6/syn-1 profile was assessed by means of Wilcoxon rank-sum test for unpaired data and analyses of variance . ''
RESULTS Expression Profile of BCL-6 , syn-1 , and CD4OL in Nonneoplastic Lymph Nodes We first assessed the expression pattern of BCL-6 , syn-1 , and CD40L in nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues .
The GC B cells of 12/12 ( 100 % ) nonneoplastic lymph nodes displayed a strong and specific reactivity for BCL-6 .
The B cells of mantle and paracortical zones stained negative for BCL-6 , with the exception of a subset of large B cells , which were localized around the follicles .
These BCL-6* large B cells were also seen at the margins of the GC .
A strong staining for syn-1 was found on plasma cells , but not other cell populations .
Overall , these data show that BCL-6 and syn-1 map to lymph node areas that are populated by B cells at different stages of differentiation .
In particular , B cells within the GC are BCL-6*/syn-1~ , whereas plasma cells , which predominate in interfollicular areas , are BCL-6-/syn-1 + .
Expression of CD4O0L in nonneoplastic lymph nodes was restricted to small lymphocytes .
These cells usually displayed a prominent dotlike or punctate paranuclear staining and occasionally exhibited a membrane staining pattern .
In the mantle and germinal center light zone of secondary follicles , CD4OL * cells paralleled the distribution of CD4* T lymphocytes .
Expression Profile of BCL-6 , syn- 1 , and CD40/CD4OL in NLPHD In 10/10 ( 100 % ) cases of NLPHD , the majority of neoplastic ( L & H ) cells ( range , 75 % to 100 % ) expressed BCL-6 ( Table 1 Fig 1 .

2224 and Fig 1A ) .
Syn-1 expression was consistently negative in L & H cells of all NLPHD ( Fig 1B ) , which thus could be ascribed to the BCL-6+/syn-1~ phenotype ( Fig 1 A and B ) .
CD40 was strongly expressed by L & H cells of 100 % NLPHD .
Reactive CD4O0L+* T cells in the tumor nodules of NLPHD were rare and distributed in a scattered fashion .
Rosetting of L & H cells by CD4OL* T cells was absent in all fields analyzed , suggesting that CD4O0/CD40L interactions between L & H cells and reactive T lymphocytes is not a feature of NLPHD .
L & H cells of all NLPHD scored negative for LMP-1 , consistent with absence of infection by EBV .
Expression Profile of BCL-6 , syn-1 , and LMP-1 in CHD The expression pattern of BCL-6 in CHD was characterized by a certain degree of heterogeneity .
In the majority of CHD cases ( 25/43 ; 58 % ) , RS cells did not express BCL-6 ( Table 1 and Fig 1C ) .
A fraction of CHD ( 18/43 ; 42 % ) displayed a low proportion of BCL-6* RS cells ( Fig 1E ) ( < 10 % in 14/18 ) .
Only 4/43 ( 9 % ) CHD contained > 10 % BCL-6+* RS cells .
A positive staining for syn-1 was detected in all CHD ( 43/43 ; 100 % ) , although the proportion of syn-1* RS cells and the intensity of staining was variable among the cases ( Table 1 and Fig 1D and F ) .
In cases containing both syn-1 * and BCL-6+* RS cells ( n = 18 ; Table 1 and Fig 1E and F ) , double-staining experiments showed that expression of these two antigens was mutually exclusive in the same RS cell ( Fig 1G and H ) .
Comparison of BCL-6 and syn-1 expression in each individual CHD led to the identification of two major phenotypic profiles of the disease ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
The first phenotypic profile associated with 25/43 ( 58 % ) CHD and was characterized by BCL-6~/syn-1* RS cells ( Fig 1C and D ) in the absence of BCL-6*/syn-1~ RS cells .
The second phenotypic profile associated with 18/43 ( 42 % ) CHD and was characterized by the coexistence of BCL-6~/syn-1* and BCL-6*/syn-1~ RS cells ( Fig 1E through H ) in the same biopsy .
Because CHD may be subclassified in terms of morphology ( nodular sclerosis v mixed cellularity ) and expression of conventional lymphoid markers ( B-cell phenotype v undetermined phenotype ) , we proceded to compare the expression of BCL-6 and syn-1 with the morphologic and phenotypic variant of CHD .
This analysis showed that BCL-6+/syn-1~ and BCL-6-/syn-1* RS cells were found in both nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity subtypes and in all conventional phenotypes ( Table 1 ) .
Nine of 43 CHD were infected by EBV .
In these cases , variable proportions ( 5 % to 75 % ) of RS cells expressed LMP-1 .

*None of the HD cases tested displayed BCL-6~/syn-1~ phenotype only .
CARBONE ET AL In cases displaying both LMP-1* and BCL-6* RS cells ( n = 4 ) , double-staining experiments ruled out the coexpression of BCL-6 and LMP-1 by the same RS cell .
Relationship Between RS Cell Phenotype and CD40/CD4OL Interactions in CHD In all CHD , RS cells strongly expressed CD40 but were consistently negative for CD4OL .
Conversely , CD4OL was expressed by numerous T lymphocytes present in the reactive background .
Single-color IHC showed that CD4O0L+* T cells localized preferentially in close proximity of RS cells , a phenomenon known as rosetting .
Therefore , by means of serial section two-color IHC , we explored the relationship between CD40L* T cells and the BCL-6/syn-1 profile of RS cells in six different CHD cases ( see Materials and Methods ) .
These data showed that in most instances BCL-6+/syn-1~ RS cells did not display rosetting by CD4O0L+® T cells ( 65 % of the BCL-6*/ syn-1~ RS cells examined ) ( Fig 2 ) .
Conversely , 93 % of BCL-6~/syn-1* RS cells were rosetted by > 1 CD4O0L+* T cells ( Fig 2 ) .
CD4O0L* T cells were of a significantly higher number around BCL-6-/syn-1* RS cells ( mean = 1.39 ; median = 1 ) than around BCL-6+/syn-1~ RS cells ( mean = 0.39 ; median = 0 ) ( Wilcoxon 2-sample test , P < .001 ) .
Analyses of variance showed that the most important source of difference was the BCL-6/syn-1 profile ( F value = 345.5 ; P < .001 ) , and not specific examined cases ( F value = 0.69 ; P = .63 ) .
Analysis of Mutations of the 5 '' Noncoding Regions of BCL-6 in CHD Cell Lines To define the histogenesis of BCL-6~/syn-1* RS cells , we have investigated CHD for the occurrence of mutations of BCL-6 5 '' noncoding sequences .
These mutations are regarded as a genetic marker of GC derivation that is achieved during B-cell transition through the GC and is subsequently retained during further Because of the paucity of RS cells in CHD biopsies , we have used CHD cell lines representative of B-cell-derived CHD ( KM-H2 , SUP-HD1 , SBH-1 , L-428 ) expressing the BCL-6~/syn-1* phenotype .
Mutational analysis by DNA direct sequencing showed that 3 out of 4 of these cell lines ( KM-H2 , SUP-HD1 , and L-428 ) harbored BCL-6 5 ' mutations clustering in the proximity of the BCL-6 promoter ( Table 3 and Fig 3 ) .
The frequency of BCL-6 mutations in CHD cell lines ( Table 3 ) was within the range of mutation rates detected in other lymphomas known to derive from the GC , as shown by our analysis of 102 cases of B-DLCL and 20 cases of FL ( G.G. , D.C. , A.C. , unpublished observation , May 1998 ) .
Also , the spectrum of BCL-6 mutations observed in CHD cell lines was similar to that of B-DLCL , as shown by a predominance of single-nucleotide substitutions over point insertions and deletions , as well as a relative excess of transitions versus transversions .
Mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions appeared to be specific for CHD cell lines of B-cell origin , because the CHD cell lines L-540 , HDLM-2 , CO , and HD-MY-Z , which derive from lineages other than B cells , were devoid of mutations .
DISCUSSION The aim of this study was to investigate the histogenesis of the pathologic spectrum of HD .

Only scattered CD4O0L+ ( cytoplasmic , blue ) lymphoid cells are detectable in the proximity of BCL-6+* ( nuclear , red ) RS cells ( A ) , whereas expression of CD4O0L ( cytoplasmic , blue ) can be observed on several reactive lymphocytes that surround syn-1* ( cytoplasmic and membranous , red ) RS cells ( B ) .

our data are twofold .
First , different categories of HD with B-cell or undetermined phenotype correspond to different stages of B-cell maturation .
Second , the maturation stage of the HD neoplastic clone is associated with a different composition of the reactive background of HD .
The expression profile of BCL-6 and syn-1 in the neoplastic cells of HD segregates two major phenotypic categories of the disease , ie , BCL-6*/syn-1~ and BCL-6-/syn-1* .
In normal lymphoid tissues , these phenotypic profiles correspond to GC and post-GC B cells , respectively . ' '' ''
The BCL-6*/syn-1~ profile associates with 100 % NLPHD , thus corroborating the notion that NLPHD is a relatively homogenous disorder closely reflecting the GC phenotype ( Fig 4 ) .2 > > The BCL-6-/syn-1* profile associates with the majority of CHD , indicating that RS cells are frequently represented by post-GC B cells that have undergone preterminal differentiation ( Fig 4 ) .
Although BCL-6~-/ syn-1* RS cells no longer express GC-restricted phenotypic markers , their histogenetic derivation from GC cells is indicated by the association with molecular hallmarks of GC transition .
In fact , this and previous studies have shown that RS cells of CHD harbor mutations of BCL-6 and Ig genes , which are regarded as markers of B-cell transition through the GC.5 '' From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

The differences observed in BCL-6 and syn-1 expression throughout the pathologic spectrum of HD may be caused by differences in the composition of the reactive background .
It is well established that rosetting of RS cells by activated CD4* T lymphocytes is mediated in part by the CD40/CD4OL adhesion pathway and that signaling between RS cells and rosetting T lymphocytes actively involves the CD40/CD4OL system .
`` > 5 '' '' Whereas CD40 is consistently expressed by both L & H and RS cells , the abundance and distribution of CD4O0L * T lymphocytes varies markedly in different HD categories '' ( and this study ) .
Our data indicate that CD40/CDA4O0L signaling between neoplastic and reactive cells is a prominent feature of CHD , but not of NLPHD , and that it preferentially clusters with RS cells displaying the BCL-6~-/syn-1* phenotype .

BCL-6 AND Syn-1 EXPRESSION ON RS CELLS OF HD pre-GC B-CELLS BCL-6/syn-1~ GC B-CELLS PLASMACELLS BCL-6/syn-1* Ons - .

A model of HD histogenesis .
The proposed model is based on the expression pattern of BCL-6 and syn-1 throughout physiologic B-cell differentiation .
B cells within the GC display the BCL-6+*/syn-1~ phenotype , whereas B cells that have exited the GC and have undergone further maturation toward the plasma cell stage exhibit the BCL-G6-/syn-1* phenotype .
On this basis , neoplastic cells of NLPHD consistently express the BCL-6+/syn-1~ phenotype and thus closely reflect the GC phenotype .
Conversely , RS cells of CHD may express either the BCL-6+/syn-1~ phenotype or the BCL-6-/syn-1+* phenotype , consistent with further maturation tow ard the late stages of B-cell differentiation .
Most CHD cases display only BCL-6-/syn-1+* RS cells , whereas a fraction of CHD displays a mixture of BCL-6+/ syn-1~ and BCL-6-/syn-1+* RS cells , suggesting heterogeneity in the differentiation stage of the neoplastic clone .
The CD40 molecule is expressed on neoplastic cells of both NLPHD and HD , whereas expression of CD40L by reactive T cells is restricted to the case of CHD and is consistently absent in NLPHD .
In CHD containing both BCL-6+*/ syn-1~ and BCL-6-/syn-1* RS cells , CD40L+ T cells preferentially cluster around BCL-6-/syn-1+* RS cells .
This model suggests that CD40/ CD40L-mediated interactions between tumor and reactive cells modulate the differentiation of the neoplastic clone and is consistent with the in vitro observation that CD40/ CD4OL interactions dow nreg-ulate BCL-6 in B cells with a GC phenotype .
The phenotypic profiles identified by BCL-6 , syn-1 , and LMP-1 in RS cells , as well as the preferential distribution of CD40L* T cells around BCL-6~-/syn-1* RS cells , are consistent with in vivo observations derived from other lymphoma types and with experimental evidence gained from in vitro cellular models .
In vivo , it has been reported that BCL-6 expression is mutually exclusive with syn-1 and LMP-1 also in the context of systemic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -related lymphomas and primary central nervous system lymphomas ( PCNSL ) .
'** > ° In these two settings , the BCL-6*/syn-1~/ LMP-1~ profile associates with cases displaying a large non-cleaved cell morphology and reflecting a GC phenotype , whereas the BCL-6~/syn-1*/LMP-1* profile associates with cases displaying an immunoblastic morphology and reflecting a post-GC phenotype .
In vitro , it has been shown that CD40/ CD4O0L signaling is able to downregulate BCL-6 in B cells with a GC phenotype . ''
A similar effect is exerted in vitro also by LMP-1 , which , in fact , is functionally homologous to CD40 . !
`` 4 '' On this basis , it may be postulated that CD40 ligation may be the major determinant of the phenotype of RS cells .
In EBV-infected HD , the effect mediated by CD40 ligation may be substituted by RS expression of LMP-1 .
According to this model , NLPHD retains BCL-6 expression and , consequently , 2227 the GC phenotype , because L & H cells are not exposed to CD40L signaling .
Conversely , CD40/CD40L interactions and/or LMP-1 expression induce RS cells of CHD to downregulate BCL-6 , thus allowing further maturation of the tumor clone to assume a post-GC phenotypic profile .
Presumably , cases of CHD containing a mixture of BCL-6~/syn-1* and BCL-6+*/ syn-1~ RS cells represent tumors in which , for unknown reasons , the differentiation process of RS cells is not complete in a fraction of cells and/or is still ongoing at the time of observation .
