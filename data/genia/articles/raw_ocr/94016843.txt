11 Phosphatidylcholine Hydrolysis Activates NF- « B and Increases Human Immunodeficiency Virus Replication in Human Monocytes and T Lymphocytes FERNANDO ARENZANA-SEISDEDOS , '* BELEN FERNANDEZ , !

PC-PLC-activated hydrolysis of PC was found to induce bona fide p50/p65 NF- « B binding activity in three different cell lines of human or murine origin .
No significant changes in the turnover of other cellular phospholipids were detected in PC-PLC-treated cells .
Induction of NF- « B by PC-PLC did not depend on de novo synthesis of proteins or autocrine secretion of either tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 1 .
In human monocytic and lymphoblastoid T-cell lines , induction of NF- « B by PC-PLC resulted in clear induction of luciferase expression vectors placed under the control of synthetic « B enhancers or wild type , but not « B-mutated , HIV long terminal repeat constructs .
HIV replication was increased by PC-PLC in chronically infected monocytes and T lymphocytes .
NF-KB activation promoted by addition of exogenous PC-PLC correlated with an intense production of diacylglycerol .
However , addition of a phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC from B. cereus also induced diacylglycerol but did not activate « B enhancer-directed vectors .
PC-PLC-induced NF-KB activation could not be blocked by a specific inhibitor of phorbol ester-inducible protein kinases C. These results indicate that a cellular transduction pathway , dependent on specific PC breakdown , is functional in T lymphocytes and monocytes and may be used by various transmembrane receptors to activate HIV transcription through NF- « B-dependent induction of the HIV enhancer .
Initiation of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) genome transcription , after integration of the HIV provirus into host cell DNA , appears to be determined by transcription factors interacting with the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 14 ) .
Transcriptional activation of the LTR depends largely on a major enhancer made of two directly repeated sequences able to respond to the transcription factor NF- « B ( 25 , 33 ) .
For this event to occur and HIV transcription to be initiated , NF-kB , usually associating pSO ( 18 ) and p65 ( 30 ) subunits , must be activated and translocated into the nucleus from the cyto-plasm , where it is normally retained by interaction with inhibitory proteins named IxB ( 3 , 22 ) .
The biochemical events leading to this critical dissociation of NF-kB heterodimers from IxB have not been elucidated .
Induction of transcriptionally active NF-kB complexes occurs after cellular activation either following physiological signalling engaging the CD3-T-cell receptor complex in T lymphocytes , in particular antigen recognition ( 15 , 16 ) and anti-CD3 antibodies ( 35 ) , or following stimulation with artificial inducers such as phorbol esters in both T lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages , the two main targets of HIV infection ( 37 ) .
Inhibition of type C protein kinases ( PKC ) in T lymphocytes blocks induction of the HIV enhancer by either CD3 antibodies or phorbol esters ( 35 ) .
Thus , it is assumed that in all these cases , NF-kB induction depends on the activation of PKC .
This is obviously the case when phorbol esters are used * Corresponding author .
6596 as the inducer , since some PKC isoforms , such as the calcium-dependent « , B , and y PKCs , are intracellular targets for phorbol esters .
Furthermore , direct demonstration that purified PKC indeed phosphorylates IxB has been obtained with cell lysates ( 13 ) .
The intracellular messenger which links membrane signals to PKC is diacylglycerol ( DAG ) .
An important but transient source of DAG is the hydrolysis of phos-phatidylinositol ( PI ) which takes place following activation signals through specific membrane receptors in many cell types , especially T lymphocytes ( 5 ) .
However , hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) is now largely accepted to account for the production of the sustained amounts of DAG detected in activated cells , in contrast to DAG derived from PI hydrolysis ( 11 , 23 ) .
The latter declines within minutes after the onset of cell activation .
The sustained production of DAG generated after specific breakdown of PC is associated with the induction of DNA synthesis in fibroblasts ( 21 ) .
Moreover , induction of the interleukin 2Ra ( IL-2Ra « ) gene and DNA synthesis in human T lymphocytes require the prolonged presence of high levels of DAG ( 4 ) , suggesting that a sustained production of this messenger is necessary to maintain transcription of inducible genes involved in cell activation and proliferation .
Stimulation of T lymphocytes either with phorbol esters or through the CD3-T-cell receptor activates NF-kB and HIV LTR transcription and also induces breakdown of PC , with generation of DAG independently of PI hydrolysis ( 34 ) .
Furthermore , activation of p21 ras , which plays a critical role in cell activation and induces PC breakdown and DAG formation without significant modification of PI metabolism ( 20 , 28 ) Vor .
67 , 1993 transactivates the HIV enhancer in human cells ( 1a ) .
Finally , recent data from our laboratory now directly document in Xenopus laevis oocytes a cascade of transduction events involving ras-induced hydrolysis of PC and DAG production mediated by a PC-specific phospholipase C ( PC-PLC ) ( 10 ) .
This was shown to lead to both nuclear translocation of NF-kB and enhanced transcription of « B-dependent vectors through activation of the zeta isoform of PKC ( PKC { ) , a calcium-independent and non-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -inducible isotype of PKC ( 26 ) .
Altogether , the above-mentioned data indicate that , in human monocytes and T lymphocytes , the two types of target cells of HIV infection , phosphodiesterase-mediated hydrolysis of PC has the potential to be a major activation pathway leading to induction of nuclear NF- « B-binding activity and transactivation of the HIV enhancer .
Using cell systems relevant to HIV pathogenesis , including an IL-2-dependent T-cell clone , we demonstrate that specific hydrolysis of PC , but not PI , induces nuclear translocation of bona fide NF-kB and enhances HIV enhancer activity independently of classical , phorbol ester-inducible PKC .
Furthermore , we show that increased HIV enhancer activity correlates with augmented HIV replication in chronically infected cells treated with PC-PLC .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
J. Jhan is a human lymphoblastoid cell line derived from Jurkat .
U937 is a human monocytic cell line .
U1 , derived from U937 , and ACH2 , derived from the lymphoblastoid T-cell line CEM , are chronically HIV-infected cell lines .
NIH 3T3 cells are murine fibroblasts .
The SPBenv cell line was obtained by infection of SPB21 cells , an IL-2-dependent CD4 * T-cell clone ( 15 ) , with a recombinant HIV virus carrying an amphotropic envelope .
The recombinant HIV virus was obtained by cotransfecting in COS7 cells a noninfectious HIV provirus , a derivative of HIV R7/neo ( 12 ) ( a gift from M. Feinberg ) carrying a 1,300-bp deletion from nucleotide 5930 to nucleotide 7210 in the envelope-coding region , and a simian virus 40 promoter-directed expression vector ( a gift from M. Alizon ) of the amphotropic 4070A Moloney leukemia virus envelope ( 7 ) .
Selection of infected cells was obtained by using a neomycin selectable marker located at the 3 ' end ( nef region ) of the HIV genome .
Reagents .
PC-PLC from Bacillus cereus was either obtained and purified essentially as previously described ( 21 ) or purchased from Calbiochem .
Pl-specific phospholipase C ( PI-PLC ) from B. cereus was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim .
Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) was a gift from W. Fiers .
The bisindolyImaleimide GF 109203X ( GF ) ( 36 ) is an inhibitor of PKC a , B , and y isoforms and was a kind gift from J. Kirilovsky ( Glaxo , Les Ulis , France ) .
PMA was obtained from Sigma .
Unless indicated otherwise , 2 U of PC-PLC per ml was used to stimulate cell cultures .
TNF and PMA were used at concentrations of 340 IU/ml and 20 ng/ml , respectively .
Plasmids .
Vector HIV-LTR-Luc ( 2 ) consisted of the Xhol ( -640 ) -HindllII ( +86 ) fragment containing the U3 and R regions of the HIV type 1 strain LAI cloned in a luciferase expression vector ( pC-Luc ) ( 15 ) .
HIV-LTRA « B-Lue ( 2 ) was obtained by insertion into the pC-Luc plasmid of the « kB consensus motif-deleted Xhol-HindllI fragment of the LAI LTR .
The kb-CONA-Luc vector derives from a CONA-CAT vector described by Kimura et al .
( 19 ) .
It carries a luciferase gene ( pCLuc ) placed under the control of three synthetic copies of the kB consensus of the immunoglobulin « -chain PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE HYDROLYSIS INDUCES HIV REPLICATION 6597 promoter cloned in the BamHI site located upstream of the conalbumin ( CONA ) transcription start site .
The CONA-LUC vector is identical to plasmid kb-CONA-Luc but does not contain the « kB sequences .
The PC-PLC expression vector , pCMV-PLC , was constructed from the B. cereus PC-PLC gene .
It carries the 21-amino-acid signal peptide of the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA .
This construct , including 19 bp upstream of the start codon , was then inserted into the mammalian expression vector pRcCMV ( pCMV ) , purchased from Invitrogene .
Analysis of products of phospholipid metabolism .
For determination of the levels of different phospholipids , cells were labelled with 10 pCi of [ methy ! -'*C ] choline for PC and sphingomyelin and with 10 mCi of [ 2-'*CJethan-1-olamine for phos-phatidylethanol .
Identical amounts of L- [ U-'*CJserine and [ myo-2-*Hjlinositol were used for labelling of phosphatidylserine or polyphosphoinositides , respectively .
After induction with agonists , cell cultures were treated with methanol and cell extracts were fractionated into chloroform and aqueous phases .
Organic phases were processed essentially as described elsewhere ( 21 ) .
For determination of DAG , we used a DAG detection kit ( Amersham ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer .
Results are expressed in terms of the *P label incorporated into phosphatidic acid , which results from the in vitro action of a DAG kinase on the pool of cellular DAG .
Thus , the amounts of radiolabelled phosphatidic acid can be directly correlated to the levels of DAG produced by cells .
EMSA .
Crude nuclear cell extracts were prepared as described elsewhere ( 17 ) .
For electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , 3 wg of protein extract was incubated with [ « -°P ] dCTP-labelled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding either to the « kB motif found in the promoter of the immunoglobulin -chain gene or to the tandem of kB sequences of the HIV enhancer .
The binding reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 5 % polyacryl-amide gels .
In DNA-binding competition assays , unlabelled oligonucleotides were used in a 40-fold molar excess with respect to the corresponding radiolabelled probes .
When indicated , specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies ( a gift from R. T. Hay ) generated against recombinant p50 or p65 ) or a C-terminal peptide of c-Rel ( a gift from I. Verma ) were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 10 min before addition of probes .
Similarly , 20 ng of recombinant IxB/MAD-3 ( a gift from R. T. Hay ) was used to block the binding of NF- « B to the radiolabelled oligonucleotides .
Transfection assays .
Plasmids were transfected in U937 or J. Jhan cells by the DEAE-dextran method .
Briefly , 5 x 10° cells were incubated with 5 ug of DNA in a buffer containing 500 ug of DEAE-dextran per ml for 20 min at room temperature .
Subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique for 4 h. After transfection , cells were washed and allowed to remain in culture for 48 h in the corresponding culture medium enriched either with 5 % fetal calf serum in the case of U937 and J. Jhan cells or with 0.2 % fetal calf serum for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts .
Transfected cells were induced with the different stimuli for the last 6 h of the culture period .
For detection of luciferase activity , total cell extracts were prepared in a lysis cell buffer , and samples were analyzed , as previously described ( 15 ) , in a luminometer ( Berthold , Gosheim , Germany ) .
Data are expressed in terms of relative luciferase activity units , calculated as ( light emission from experimental sample - light emission of lysis buffer alone ) /micrograms of cellular protein in the sample .
Detection of p24 HIV antigen .
U1 or ACH2 cells were seeded at 5 X 10°/ml and stimulated for 24 h. At this time , 6598 ARENZANA-SEISDEDOS ET AL .

PC-PLC from B. cereus induces nuclear « B-binding activity on human monocytes ( U937 ) and T lymphocytes ( J. Jhan ) independently of de novo synthesis of proteins .
Cells were preincubated for 45 min with 50 jg of cycloheximide ( CHX ) per ml , and then they were stimulated for 90 additional min with PC-PLC or TNF ( J. Jhan ) .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide ( 5-ACACAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTC CAGGGA-3 ' ) containing the tandem of « B wild-type ( WT ) sequences of the HIV enhancer was used as a radiolabelled probe .
For DNA-binding competition ( COMPET .
) , unlabelled oligonucleotides ( WT or the mutated [ M ] counterpart [ 5-ACACACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTCC AGGGA-3 ' ] ) were used in a 40-fold molar excess .
* , a sample containing radiolabelled probe incubated in the absence of nuclear extracts .
culture supernatants were harvested , and p24 viral core antigen was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( DuPont/NEN ) .
SPBenv-cells were starved of IL-2 for 18 h before induction , and viral antigen was evaluated in the supernatants of 24-h-stimulated cells .
RESULTS PC-PLC induces bona fide nuclear « B-binding activity in human monocytes , T lymphocytes , and murine fibroblasts .
Analysis by EMSA of crude nuclear extracts from monocytes , T lymphocytes , or murine fibroblasts incubated with PC-PLC from B. cereus revealed the presence of specific « kB-binding activity in the nuclei of treated cells ( Fig .
1 and 2 ) .
Specific binding of NF-kB proteins from either U937 or J. Jhan cells to the radiolabelled probes ( HIV enhancer or « -chain immunoglobulin « B motifs ) was abrogated by addition of a 40-fold molar excess of the corresponding unlabelled , wild-type oligonucleotide but not its mutated counterpart ( Fig .
1 ) .
In some experiments ( Fig .
1 , J. Jhan cells , and Fig .
2 , NIH 3T3 cells ) , nuclear extracts from TNF-treated cells were introduced as a source of control bona fide NF-kB .
Results displayed in Fig .
1 show that inhibition of protein synthesis did not block the induction of NF- « B complexes by PC-PLC .
On the contrary , at least in T lymphocytes , stimulation of cycloheximide-treated cells with either PC-PLC or TNF resulted in increased induction of NF-kB ( Fig .
1 , J. Jhan cells ) .
In order to characterize the components of the kB-retarded complexes induced by PC-PLC , we preincubated nuclear extracts from U937 cells with either recombinant IxB/MAD3 or rabbit specific antisera directed against p50 , p65 , or c-Rel .
Either anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies detect single bands in Western immunoblot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts from U937 cells , corresponding in apparent molecular mass to proteins of 50 and 65 kDa , respectively ( 1 ) .
The presence of the p50 subunit in the complexes induced by PC-PLC was demonstrated ( Fig .
2 , U937 cells ) , as an anti-p50 antibody , but not a preimmune rabbit serum , greatly impaired binding of NF- « B proteins and induced the up-shifting of the kB-binding activity .
It should be noted that addition of p50 antiserum equally blocked the formation of both the more slowly and the faster-migrating complexes ( Fig .
2 , U937 cells ) .
In contrast , Fig .
2 shows that incubation of PC-PLC-induced U937 nuclear extracts with anti-p65 antiserum , but not with an anti-c-Rel antiserum , dramatically retarded the migration of the more slowly migrating complex but did not affect the mobility of the faster-migrating complex .
Together , these data demonstrate that two « B-binding activities mainly composed of homodimeric p50 ( lower arrowhead ) or p50/p65 ( upper arrowhead ) complexes were induced in U937 cells by PC-PLC .
This conclusion is reinforced by the ability of recombinant IxB to prevent binding of heterodimeric p50/p65 complexes in the three cell lines ( Fig .
2 ) without affecting the formation of DNA-binding complexes formed by p50 homodimers ( lower arrowhead ) detected in both U937 and NIH 3T3 cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
PC hydrolysis induces transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR and HIV replication in chronically infected cell lines .
To demonstrate that nuclear NF- « B complexes induced by PC-PLC in U937 or J. Jhan cells were functionally active , we analyzed the transcription activity of transfected luciferase expression vectors placed under the control of the HIV LTR .
After 42 h of transfection , cells were stimulated for 6 additional h with PC-PLC , and then luciferase activity was evaluated in whole-cell lysates .
TNF was used as a positive control of HIV LTR transactivation .
Results of transient transfection depicted in Fig .
3 show a clear induction of HIV LTR activity and demonstrate that the enhancer sequences mediated the transactivation effect promoted by PC-PLC inasmuch as deletion of the tandem of « kB motifs abolished the LTR responses VoL .

for 1 h with 2 U of PC-PLC per ml .
One unit of PC-PLC per ml was used to induce NIH 3T3 cells .
Nuclear extracts from U937 cells were preincubated for 10 min with specific anti-p50 , anti-p65 , or anti-c-Rel rabbit antibodies ( ANTIB . )
before addition of the radiolabelled probes .
A rabbit preimmune ( pre . )
serum was used as a control .
U937 cells were preincubated for 45 min with 2.5 wM PKC inhibitor GF before stimulation with PC-PLC .
To prevent the formation of NF- « B DNA , 20 ng of recombinant IxB/MAD3 ( IxB ) was added to the nuclear extracts from U937 , J. Jhan , or NIH 3T3 cells .
For both U937 and J. Jhan nuclear extracts , the « B wild-type sequence of the HIV enhancer was used as a probe .
For NIH 3T3 extracts , a synthetic oligonucleotide with the xB motif from the immunoglobulin « -chain promoter was used as a radiolabelled probe .
Specific inhibition ( COMPET . )
of DNA binding by unlabelled oligonucleotides was performed ( NIH 3T3 and J. Jhan cells ) by adding a 40-fold molar excess of the corresponding wild-type ( WT ) oligonucleotide .
The positions of heterodimeric p50/p65 complexes and homodimeric p50 complexes are indicated ( upper and lower arrowheads , respectively ) .
to either PC-PLC or TNF .
Maximal induction was usually obtained at PC-PLC concentrations of 1 to 2 U/ml , although concentrations as low as 0.1 U/ml induced detectable transactivation ( data not shown ) .
Similar results were obtained with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by using the « B-CONA-Luc vector .
It should be noted that the HIV LTR transactivation induced by PC-PLC correlated with its PC-hydrolyzing activity and DAG production ( Table 1 and Fig .
4a ) .
In order to obtain further evidence for the specificity of this effect , we compared the effects of PI-PLC and PC-PLC , both obtained from B. cereus , on U937 cells transfected with the kB-CONA-Luc vector .
Results shown in Fig .
4b indicate that PC-PLC , but not PI-PLC , was able to increase the activity of the kB-directed vector .
The inability of PI-PLC to enhance the activity of kB enhancers contrasted with its capacity to induce a clear increase of DAG in the same cells ( Fig .
4a ) .
The above results , obtained with exogenously added PC-PLC , were confirmed in experiments whose results are shown in Fig .
5 by using an expression vector for the PC-PLC from B. cereus .
Transient expression of this enzyme in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in a clear and enhancer-dependent transactivation of the < B-CONA-Luc vector in transient cotransfection assays .
Interestingly , in these experiments the level of transactivation of xB-CONA-Luc obtained by cotransfection of the PC-PLC expression vector was not further modified by exogenously added PC-PLC ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether HIV enhancer transactivation induced by PC-PLC resulted in augmented HIV genome transcription and virus production , we induced hydrolysis of PC in three different cell lines ( U1 , ACH2 , and SPBenv- ) harboring integrated and replicative HIV provirus .
Results shown in Fig .
6 demonstrate that PC-PLC treatment of U1 , a monocytic cell line , or ACH2 , a lymphoblastoid cell line , consistently led to enhanced levels of p24 Gag antigen in cell supernatants , which correlated well with the levels of HIV LTR transactivation promoted by PC-PLC in control monocytic or lymphocytic cells ( Fig .
3 ) .

This rules out the possibility that the effect of PC-PLC in HIV-infected cells was due to an enhanced shedding of virus particles and not to increased expression of the viral genome .
In an attempt to analyze the role of PC hydrolysis in the reactivation of HIV replication in normal , nontransformed human T lymphocytes , we used an IL-2-dependent T-cell line harboring an integrated HIV provirus replicating at very low levels .
Stimulation of these cells with PC-PLC or with PMA for 24 h in the absence of IL-2 , significantly enhanced production of p24 antigen ( Fig .
6 ) .
Addition of exogenous PC-PLC specifically hydrolyzes PC but not other , cellular phospholipids .
In a previous report ( 21 ) , we documented that addition of purified PC-PLC from B. cereus to NIH 3T3 cells activates breakdown of PC in the absence of significant changes in the turnover of other phospholipids .
Results given in Table 1 show that a similar phenomenon occurred in J. Jhan and U937 cells treated for 30 min with 1 U of PC-PLC per ml .
Indeed , under these experimental conditions a clear effect on PC metabolism was observed without modifications of the sphingomyelin or PI turnover .
Very modest modifications of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanol were detected .
Concomitant with the hydrolysis of PC , a dramatic and prompt increase in DAG levels was observed in U937 cells treated with PC-PLC ( Fig .
4a ) .
Classical , PMA-inducible PKC a , B , and y are not involved in the transduction of PC-PLC-induced activation of NF-KB and HIV genome transcription .
To investigate whether NF-kB nuclear translocation induced by PC-PLC requires activation of PMA-inducible PKC isoforms , we stimulated U937 cells in the presence of GF , a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the « , B , and y PKC isoforms .
Figure 2 shows that 2.5 wM GF did not impair induction of nuclear NF-kB complexes by PC-PLC in U937 cells .
In agreement with the lack of inhibitory effect of GF on the nuclear translocation of NF- « B , transactivation of the HIV LTR and induction of HIV replication were unaffected by this compound ( Fig .
7 ) .
The failure of GF to block activation by PC-PLC was not due to lack of effect of this inhibitor on its targets , since GF abolished induction of both LTR transactivation and viral replication induced by PMA ( Fig .
7 ) .
DISCUSSION Activation of the PC turnover by exogenous PC-PLC was shown to induce a clear expression of nuclear kB-binding J. ViroL .

activity in human monocytes and T lymphocytes and also murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts .
These results are in agreement with a recent report ( 32 ) suggesting that TNF-induced PC-PLC activity activates nuclear NF- « B binding activity and our previous observation that expression of activated p21ras , an inducer of PC breakdown ( 20 , 28 ) , activates the HIV enhancer in human cells ( 1a ) .
The present results were obtained with two different , highly purified preparations of PC-PLC , one commercially available and the other prepared by us .
Furthermore , expression of a transfected B. cereus PC-PLC gene , the same which was used to prepare purified proteins , was shown to induce transcriptional effects on B-dependent genes similar to that observed in cells treated with exogenous PC-PLC proteins .
It should be stressed , however , that nuclear translocation of NF- « B does not always result in functional transactivation of the HIV enhancer .
We have indeed shown a dissociation between these two events in human T-cell clones ( 15 ) .

Endogenous PC-PLC expressed from a cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter-directed vector induces transactivation of a kB enhancer .
One microgram of the luciferase reporter plasmid ( « B-CONA-Luc or CONA-Luc ) and 2.5 ug of either the vector carrying the PC-PLC gene ( pCMV-PLC ) or a control without the inserted gene ( pCMV ) were cotransfected in NIH 3T3 cells .
For detection of luciferase activity , cell lysates were analyzed 48 h after transfection .
Fold amplification is indicated at the top of each bar .
The results are representative of three independent cotransfection experi-ments .
RLU , relative luciferase activity units .
show that PC breakdown induced by exogenous PC-PLC results in enhanced transcription of luciferase vectors under the control of either the whole ( U3 plus R ) HIV LTR or synthetic oligonucleotides with « B-responsive motifs cloned upstream from the weak CONA promoter .
The induction of HIV LTR activity by PC-PLC correlated with detection of bona fide NF-xB complexes in EMSA using the HIV enhancer as a probe .
Moreover , deletion of the two NF- « xB-responsive motifs in the HIV LTR abolished responsiveness to exogenous PC-PLC .
To investigate this phenomenon under conditions as relevant as possible to the pathogenesis of AIDS , we generated an appropriate cell system consisting of a CD4-positive , IL-2-dependent human T-cell clone stably transfected with an infectious HIV-1 provirus clone .
The constitutive transcriptional activity of this integrated provirus was shown to be upregulated by addition in the culture medium of PC-PLC .
Thus , PC-PLC-inducible transduction pathways can activate HIV transcription in normal , nontransformed T cells under conditions likely to mimic HIV reactivation from quiescence in circulating T cells .
PC-PLC clearly induced functional nuclear bona fide NF- « B complexes in monocytes , T lymphocytes , and fibroblasts .
Con-comitantly with the induction of p50/p65 heterodimers , a significant increase of homodimeric p50 complexes was also detected in U937 and NIH 3T3 treated cells ( Fig .
2 ) .

Exogenous PC-PLC induces HIV replication in chronically infected monocytes and T lymphocytes .
SPBenv- cells were seeded at 2 x 10°/ml for 24 h after being cultured for 18 h in an IL-2-starved culture medium .
To evaluate the production of p24 , culture supernatants were harvested after 24 h of induction .
At least two independent experiments were performed with each cell line .
Fold amplification of p24 production with respect to uninduced cultures is indicated at the top of each bar .
PC-PLC-treated U937 cells indicated that they were made mainly of p50/p65 heterodimers and p50 homodimers , as their binding to « B oligonucleotides was upshifted by either antibodies to p50 or those to p65 but not by an anti-c-Rel antibody .
In contrast to anti-p50 antibodies , which promote a clear inhibition and mobility retardation of both homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes in U937 nuclear extracts ( Fig .
2 ) , addition of anti-p65 exclusively retarded the migration of heterodimeric complexes , leaving unchanged the binding of p50 homodimers ( faster-migrating complexes ) .
Furthermore , our conclusion that the more slowly migrating complexes induced by PC-PLC are composed mainly of p50/p65 heterodimers is reinforced by the ability of recombinant IxB/ MAD3 to prevent their binding to the radiolabelled probes .
The specificity of the inhibitory effect of IxB is underlined by the fact that its addition to nuclear extracts did not substantially modify the binding of p50 homodimers ( faster-migrating complexes in Fig .
2 , U937 and NIH 3T3 cells ) .

Inducibility of the HIV LTR and HIV replication by PC-PLC are not mediated by classical , PMA-inducible PKC a , B , or y. U937 cells were transfected for 42 h with the HIV-LTR-Luc vector and then were preincubated for 45 min with 2.5 M PKC inhibitor GF and subsequently stimulated for 6 additional h with PC-PLC , TNF , or PMA .
U1 cells were induced for 24 h with the same inducers .
GF was added 45 min before induction .
Production of p24 was evaluated in culture supernatants harvested 24 h after induction .
RLU , relative luciferase activity units .
PC-PLC - none __ TNF PMA _ PC-PLC _ + + + + Addition of exogenous PC-PLC from the same source as that used in this study was previously shown to promote DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in fibroblasts ( 21 ) .
We now show that exogenous PC-PLC enhances the activity of « B-dependent luciferase expression vectors and induces the replication of integrated HIV provirus .
To rule out that PC-PLC would act through transcription of cellular genes , in particular that of cellular factors known to induce NF-kB such as TNF and IL-1 , we induced cells in the presence of cycloheximide .
Our results indicate that blockade of de novo protein synthesis does not prevent activation of NF-kB complexes in PC-PLC-treated U937 cells .
These results , together with the absence of either TNF or IL-1 activity in the supernatants of PC-PLC-treated cells ( data not shown ) , rule out the possibility that autocrine secretion of cytokines plays a role in the induction of NF- « B complexes induced by PC-PLC .
PC-derived DAG is known to be a pivotal , long-lasting second messenger in cell activation and mitogenesis ( 11 , 23 ) .
Prolonged treatment of U937 cells with PC-PLC resulted in high-level production of DAG , still observed 1 h after induction .
This is not surprising , since we have previously reported that 24 h after incubation of fibroblasts with PI-PLC or PC-PLC , DAG production remains elevated ( 9 ) .
We compared the efficiencies with which PC-PLC and PI-PLC induce NF-kB activation and DAG production .
Both enzymes in J. Vigo .
duced DAG , but only PC-PLC activated NF- « B in the U937 monocytic cell line .
DAG production induced by PC-PLC was usually higher than that induced by PI-PLC .
This is unlikely to account for the difference in activities , since we observed similar differences in other cell systems ( 8 ) , despite induction of functional effects of PI-PLC such as p80 phosphorylation or PKC and epidermal growth factor receptor downregulation ( 9 ) .
We have demonstrated previously ( 21 ) and confirm here that PC-PLC induces hydrolysis of PC but very few , if any , modifications of other cellular phospholipids .
We also confirmed that exogenous PI-PLC induces hydrolysis of PI ( data not shown ) .
If DAG production indeed has a role in the transduction pathways elicited by exogenous PC-PLC and leading to NF- « B activation , two alternative explanations are possible .
One is that molecular forms of DAG induced by the two enzymes are functionally different .
The other is that PC-PLC , but not PI-PLC , induces in addition to DAG other , yet uncharacterized signals that function independently or in association with DAG to ultimately activate NF-kB .
It was recently reported that addition of synthetic forms of DAG induces sphingomyelinase activity , which in turn would be responsible for NF- « B activation ( 32 ) .
It should be noted , however , that we could not detect sphingomyelin breakdown after PC-PLC treatment of the cell lines used here .
We previously demonstrated that incubation of fibroblasts with PC-PLC induces PKC translocation ( 8 , 9 ) .
NF- « B activation induced by PC-PLC could not , in the present study , be blocked by GF , a highly specific inhibitor of PMA-inducible PKC isoforms , including a , B , and y PKCs .
This is in agreement with previous work showing that PMA-induced PKC downregulation does not block the mitogenic effect of exogenous PC-PLC on fibroblasts ( 21 ) .
These results , together with the lack of effect of PI-PLC , a known inducer of PMA-inducible PKCs ( 8 ) , suggest that the « , B , and y isoforms of PKC do not mediate the NF- B-activating effects of PC-PLC .
Although the cascade of transduction events induced by PC-PLC and resulting in NF-KB activation is not yet characterized for mammalian cells , an exciting possibility is that a new isoform of PKC , { , has a pivotal role in this cascade , integrating and transducing the signals induced by PC-PLC .
Indeed , recent data from our laboratory ( 10 ) , obtained with specific inhibitory peptides ( pseudosubstrates ) , show that { , but not « , PKC mediates the functional activation of NF-kB induced by microinjection of either p21ras or PC-PLC proteins into Xenopus oocytes .
Recent results ( 9a ) in our laboratory are compatible with this hypothesis , since cells expressing consti-tutively high levels of { PKC show permanent NF- « B nuclear binding activity .
An original cellular transduction pathway generated by cell membrane signalling and involving p21ras activation , PC breakdown , and { PKC induction may thus be envisaged .
This pathway might be used by all membrane signals which can induce PC breakdown .
This is the case with CD3 stimulation ( 34 ) , TNF ( 31 ) , IL-1 ( 29 ) , and even PMA stimulation , which , through cross-talk , can induce PC hydrolysis ( 6 , 23 ) .
In contrast , sphingomyelinase activation and ceramide production can not account for NF- « B activation by all these inducers , since stimulation of the EL4 T-cell line through CD3 or by PMA , which induces intense NF- « B-dependent HIV LTR transactivation ( 12a ) , does not elicit a ceramide response ( 24 ) .
Thus , PC breakdown triggered on the occasion of T-cell and macrophage activation by physiological inducers may have a major role in the induction of HIV replication .
In monocytes , HIV replication itself induces , in an o- , B- , and y-PKC-independent manner sustained NF- « B activation responsible for self-perpetuating HIV enhancer activity ( 2 , 27 ) .
