Transcriptional and Post-transcriptional Regulation of c-jun Expression during Monocytic Differentiation of Human Myeloid Leukemic Cells* ( Received for publication , October 19 , 1989 ) Matthew L. Shermant , Richard M. Stone , Rakesh Datta , Steven H. Bernstein , and Donald W. Kufe From the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 AP-1 , the polypeptide product of c-jun , recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences and stimulates transcription of genes responsive to certain growth factors and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradeca-noylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .
We studied the effects of TPA on the regulation of c-jun gene expression in HL-60 cells during monocytic differentiation .
Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in untreated HL-60 leukemic cells , increased significantly by 6 h , and reached near maximal levels by 24 h of exposure to 32 nm TPA .
Similar kinetics of c-jun induction by TPA were observed in human U-937 and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells .
Similar findings were obtained with bryostatin 1 ( 10 nM ) , another activator of protein kinase C and inducer of monocytic differentiation .
Furthermore , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 0.5 uM ) , a structurally distinct agent which also induces HL-60 monocytic differentiation , increased c-jun expression .
TPA treatment of HL-60 cells in the presence of cycloheximide was associated with superinduction of c-jun transcripts .
Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of c-jun gene transcription in untreated HL-60 cells , and that exposure to TPA increases this rate 3.3-fold .
Treatment of HL-60 cells with both TPA and cycloheximide had no effect on the rates of c-jun transcription .
The half-life of c-jun RNA as determined by treating HL-60 cells with TPA and actinomycin D was 30 min .
In contrast , the half-life of c-jun RNA in TPA-treated HL-60 cells exposed to cycloheximide and actinomycin D was greater than 2 h. These findings suggested that the increase in c-jun RNA observed during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms .
Avian sarcoma virus 17 , isolated from a spontaneously growing chicken sarcoma , is a retrovirus which induces fibro-sarcomas in chickens and neoplastic transformation of cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts ( 1 ) .

The carboxyl-terminal portion of was shown to contain amino acid homology with the DNA-binding region of the a yeast GCN4 regulatory protein ( 2 ) .
GCN4 binds to a specific DNA sequence which is also recognized by the mammalian transcriptional activator AP-1 .
In-deed , several investigators have demonstrated that the protooncogene c-jun-encoded product is structurally and functionally similar , if not identical , to AP-1 ( 3 , 4 ) .
The expression of c-jun is an immediate early event during activation of fibroblasts .
For example , expression of c-jun is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by serum , platelet-derived growth factor , and fibroblast growth factor in mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts ( 5 ) .
c-jun transcription is rapidly induced during the G , to G : , transition following serum stimulation of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells ( 6 ) .
Epidermal growth factor also stimulates transcription of c-jun in rat fibroblasts ( 7 ) .
Moreover , nerve growth factor transiently induces c-jun expression in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells ( 8 ) , while stimulation of c-jun expression is an early event in several human and mouse cell lines after exposure to transforming growth factor-8 ( 9 ) .
More recent studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor induces c-jun in both human fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells ( 10 , 11 ) .
Other studies have demonstrated that induction of c-Ha-ras onco-protein is associated with stimulation of c-jun expression in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using a heavy metal-inducible model ( 12 ) .
Although AP-1 binds to DNA sequences that regulate transcription of genes responsive to phorbol esters ( 13-15 ) , less is known about the effects of these agents on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of c-jun gene expression .
For example , treatment of epithelial cells with 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) '' is associated with stimulation of a c-jun promoter/reporter gene by an autoregulatory mechanism involving the AP-1 protein ( 16 ) .
Other studies have demonstrated that exposure of human fibroblasts to TPA results in enhanced c-jun expression ( 10 ) .
In human myeloid leukemia cells , treatment with TPA is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation ( 17 ) .
Similar findings have been obtained with other agents , such as bryostatin 1 , which also activate protein kinase C ( 18 ) .
The effects of these agents on the regulation of c-jun gene expression during induction of monocytic differentiation , however , are un-known .
The present studies demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 and other human myeloid leukemia cell lines with TPA is associated with the appearance of c-jun transcripts .

We also demonstrate that bryostatin 1 , and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ) , another inducer of monocytic differentiation , also increase expression of the c-jun gene .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-The HL-60 and U-937 cells were grown as previously described ( 19 , 20 ) .
THP-1 monocytic cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing 10 % fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin , 100 ug/ml streptomycin , and 2 mM L-glutamine .
Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified 5 % CO ; in air atmosphere at 37 °C .
Cells were treated with 32 nm TPA ( Sigma ) , 0.5 um 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; ( Hoffmann-La Roche ) , or 10 nM bryostatin 1 ( provided by Dr. George Pettit , Arizona State University ) .
Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma .
Preparation of RNA and Northern Blot Hybridization-Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride technique as described ( 19 ) .
Total cellular RNA ( 20 ug ) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose , 2.2 M formaldehyde gel , transferred to nitrocellulose paper , and hybridized to one of the following P-labeled DNA probes : 1 ) the 1.8-kb BamHI/EcoRI insert of a human c-jun DNA probe containing 1.0-kb cDNA and 0.8-kb 3'-untranslated sequences ( 3 ) purified from a pBluescript SK ( + ) plasmid ( provided by Dr. R. Tijan , University of California ) ; and 2 ) the 2.0-kb Pstl insert of a chicken B-actin cDNA gene purified from the pAl plasmid ( 21 ) .
Hybridization reactions were carried out for 16-24 h at 42 °C in 50 % ( v/v ) formamide , 2 x SSC ( SSC : 0.15 M sodium chloride , 0.015 M sodium citrate ) , 1 X Denhardt 's solution , 0.1 % ( w/v ) sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and 200 ug/ml salmon sperm DNA .
Filters were washed and exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR film using an intensifying screen .
The autoradiograms were scanned using an LKB ( Bromma , Sweden ) Ultroscan XL laser densitometer and analyzed using the Gelscan XL software package .
The intensity of c-jun hybridization was normalized against S-actin expression .
Run-on Transcriptional Analyses-HL-60 cells ( 10°/assay ) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline , and the nuclei were isolated by lysis in 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 buffer as described ( 19 ) .
Nuclei were resuspended in glycerol buffer and incubated in an equal volume of reaction buffer containing 100 mM KCI , 0.5 mM each of ATP , GTP , and CTP , and 200 LCi of [ « -P ] UTP ( 800 Ci/mmol , Du Pont-New England Nuclear ) at 26 °C for 30 min .
The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 l of 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 1 mm Na , EDTA , 100 mM NaCl , 20 mm MgCl ; , 150 units/ml RNasin , and 40 ug/ml DNase and incubated at 28 °C for 15 min .
After proteinase K digestion , the RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol ( 25:24:1 ) and precipitated in ethanol and 2.5 M ammonium acetate .
The RNA was further purified by Sephadex G-50 column separation .
Plasmid DNAs containing various cloned inserts were digested with restriction endonucleases as follows : 1 ) the 2.0-kb PstI fragment of the chicken B-actin pA1 plasmid ( positive control ) ; 2 ) the 1.1-kb BamHI insert of the human $ -globin gene ( negative control , Ref .
22 ) ; and 3 ) the 1.8-kb BamHI/EcoRI fragment of the human c-jun cDNA from the pBluescript SK ( + ) plasmid .
The digested DNA was run in a 1 % agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters by the method of Southern .
The filters were prehybridized in 5 x Denhardt 's solution , 40 % formamide , 4 X SSC , 5 mM Na ; EDTA , 0.4 % SDS , and 100 ug/ml yeast tRNA for 2 h. Hybridization was performed with 10 '' cpm of **P -labeled RNA/m !

The filters were then washed in 2 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 37 °C for 30 min , 10 ug/ml RNase A in 2 x SSC at 37°C for 30 min , and 0.1 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 42 °C for 30 min .
Autoradiography was performed for 3-10 days .
RESULTS c-jun Transcripts Are Induced by TPA during Human Monocytic Cell Differentiation-The effects of TPA on c-jun expression were first studied during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells .

Similar kinetics of c-jun induction were observed in TPA-treated human U-937 monocytic leukemia cells ( Fig .

Treatment of U-937 cells with TPA was also associated with the appearance of a minor 3.2-kb c-jun transcript ( Fig .
24 ) .
THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells also have constitutive c-jun expression , and the level of c-jun transcripts was increased 2.3-fold after 24 h of exposure to TPA ( Fig .
2B ) .
Other Inducers of Monocytic Differentiation Increase c-jun Expression-In contrast to TPA , treatment of HL-60 cells with bryostatin 1 was associated with a less rapid increase in c-jun transcripts .
For example , low levels of c-jun RNA were present after 24 h , and maximal induction was observed after 48 h of exposure to bryostatin 1 ( data not shown ) .
Similar effects were observed following treatment of these cells with 0.5 uM 1,25- ( OH ) .D ; ( Fig .

c-jun Expression Is Regulated at Both the Transcriptional and Post-transcriptional Levels by TPA-In order to determine whether increased levels of c-jun RNA are associated with transcriptional activation and/or enhanced stabilization of the c-jun transcript , HL-60 cells were first treated with TPA in the absence and presence of cycloheximide .
Little , if any , c-jun RNA was detectable after 2 or 4 h of TPA treatment .
In contrast , treatment with cycloheximide alone was associated with an increase in the accumulation of c-jun RNA ( Fig .
4 ) .
Moreover , the combination of cycloheximide and TPA for 2 , 4 , or 24 h increased levels of c-jun transcripts as compared with treatment with either TPA or cycloheximide alone ( Fig .
4 ) .
These results indicated that cycloheximide superinduces c-jun expression , and thus de novo protein synthesis is not required for the induction of c-jun RNA by TPA .
Run-on assays were also performed to determine whether transcriptional mechanisms are responsible for the regulation of c-jun gene expression .
c-jun gene transcription was detectable in untreated HL-60 cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
Furthermore , exposure to TPA for 24 h was associated with a 3.3-fold increase in c-jun gene transcription .
In contrast , cycloheximide had no effect on the rates of c-jun transcription ( Fig .
5 ) .
These results suggested that cycloheximide affects c-jun expression by a post-transcriptional mechanism , perhaps by stabilizing the c-jun transcript .
In order to study the post-transcriptional regulation of TPA-induced c-jun RNA levels , HL-60 cells were treated with TPA for 18 h to induce c-jun expression and then exposed to actinomycin D for various times to inhibit further transcription .
The half-life of c-jun RNA as determined by densito-metric scanning was 30 min ( Fig .

Effects of cycloheximide on c-jun RNA half-life in TPA-treated HL-60 cells .
HL-60 cells were treated with 32 nM TPA for 18 h followed by 5 ug/ml actinomycin D ( Act ) or actinomycin D and 5 ug/ml cycloheximide ( CHX ) .
Cells were harvested at the indicated times ( after the addition of actinomycin D ) and analyzed as described .
treated HL-60 cells to greater than 2 h ( Fig .
6 and data not shown ) .
Taken together , these findings suggested that the increase in c-jun RNA observed during TPA treatment is also mediated by post-transcriptional mechanisms involving the synthesis of a labile protein which affects the turnover of c-jun RNA .
DISCUSSION The present results indicate that TPA induces c-jun expression in several myeloid leukemia cell lines .
Bryostatin 1 treatment was also associated with increases in c-jun RNA levels , although the kinetics were somewhat less rapid than that observed with TPA .
These findings suggested that , as in epithelial cells and fibroblasts ( 10 , 16 ) , activation of protein kinase C appears to play a role in the regulation of c-jun expression in hematopoietic cells .
However , the present results also demonstrate that c-jun expression is increased in these cells following treatment with 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; .
This agent binds to a cytosolic protein and has not been reported to activate protein kinase C ( 23 ) .
Thus , other signaling mechanisms may regulate c-jun expression during monocytic differentiation .
In this regard , cAMP may be involved in the regulation of c-jun expression in rat pheochromocytoma cells ( 8 ) .
The present findings also suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms requiring de novo protein synthesis regulate c-jun gene expression in myeloid cells .
In this regard , inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide superinduced levels of c-jun transcripts during TPA treatment .
Furthermore , while cycloheximide had no effect on c-Jun gene transcription , this agent did prolong the half-life of the c-jun transcript .
These findings suggest that , as in the regulation of RNA levels for certain cytokines and other protooncogenes , c-jun transcripts may be selectively processed and degraded by labile ribonu-cleases in myeloid cells ( 24 , 25 ) .
Similar mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation by serum have been reported for the c-jun gene in mouse fibroblasts ( 5 , 6 ) and are probably related to the presence of an AU-rich region in the untranslated 3 ' region of this transcript ( 3 ) .
The product of the c-jun protooncogene contains a highly conserved DNA binding domain with high affinity for the TPA-responsive element ( TRE ) .
This domain , also shared by a family of mammalian transcription factors including junB , junD , c-fos , fosB , fra-1 , as well as the yeast GCN4 protein , is composed of two regions , a leucine zipper and a region rich in basic amino acids ( 26 ) .
The leucine zipper allows for dimeri-zation between certain members of this family while the basic motif is necessary for binding to the TRE ( 27-30 ) .
Specific protein complexes contribute to the DNA binding affinity ( 30-34 ) .
For example , c-jun/c-fos heterodimers bind specifically to the TRE 25 times more efficiently than c-jun homo- 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4q wou ; papeojumo ( Regulation of c-jun during Monocytic Differentiation dimers , while c-fos homodimers have little affinity for the TRE ( 27 ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated that the induction of c-fos expression is a rapid event during induction of monocytic differentiation of myeloid cells by TPA , bryostatin 1 , and 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( 18 , 35 ) .
The appearance of c-fos transcripts in TPA-treated HL-60 cells precedes that for the c-jun gene .
Consequently , the formation of c-fos/c-jun heterodimers may play a role in the transcriptional induction of c-jun expression by TPA and other inducers of monocytic differentiation .
HL-60 cells treated with TPA express histochemical , mor-phological , and functional characteristics of the monocytic lineage .
In addition to induction of c-fos transcripts , monocytic differentiation is associated with changes in the expression of certain other protooncogenes and growth regulatory genes .
For example , TPA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation is associated with a decrease in c-myc transcripts ( 35 ) .
Of potential relevance is the finding that formation of c-jun/c-fos heterodimers may be involved in the down-regulation of the c-myc gene ( 36 ) .
Monocytic differentiation is also associated with the appearance of c-fms , platelet-derived growth factor , macrophage-specific colony stimulating factor , and tumor necrosis factor transcripts ( 35 , 37-40 ) .
While it is not known whether induction of AP-1 is required for the changes observed in the expression of these genes , macrophage-specific colony stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor are known to contain AP-1-like sites in their 5 upstream promoter regions ( 41 , 42 ) .
Thus , AP-1 may be involved in the regulation of certain genes required for the proliferation , differentiation , and activation of monocytes .
Further studies are needed to determine whether the induction of AP-1 by TPA and other inducers of monocytic differentiation regulates expression of these genes by functioning as a transcriptional activator .
