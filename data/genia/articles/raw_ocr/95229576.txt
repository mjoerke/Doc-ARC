Communication Platelet-activating Factor Stimulates Transcription of the Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like Growth Factor in Monocytes CORRELATION WITH AN INCREASED « B BINDING ACTIVITY* ( Received for publication , December 16 , 1994 , and in revised form , January 25 , 1995 ) Zhixing Pan , Vladimir V. Kravchenko , and Richard D. Yet From the Department of Immunology , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , California 92037 Human peripheral blood monocytes responded to stimulation of platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) with up-regulation of the transcript for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) , a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells .
This function of PAF was observed at nanomolar concentrations of the ligand , starting at 30 min after stimulation .
The PAF-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA was accompanied by an increase in « B binding activity , These functions of PAF appeared to be mediated through the cell surface PAF receptors , as two PAF receptor antagonists , WEB 2086 and L-659,989 , blocked both the up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and « B binding activity induced by PAF .
The antagonists , however , had no effect on phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and « B binding activity .
Pretreatment of monocytes with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of PAF , whereas cholera toxin had no inhibitory effect .
Pyrrolidine di-thiocarbamate , an inhibitor for NF- « B activation , markedly reduced PAF-stimulated « B binding activity as well as up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA .
These results suggest a potential role of PAF in HB-EGF expression and provide evidence that this stimulation may occur through increased « B binding activity .

Printed in U.S.A. transforming growth factor-B , and tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNFa ) , have been shown to stimulate SMC proliferation ( 1 ) .
These factors may be produced at the site of lesion by endothelial cells as well as monocytes , which are attracted to the subendo-thelial region by locally produced chemoattractants such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , colony-stimulating factor , and transforming growth factor-8 ( 1 ) .
More recently , it was shown that monocytic cells produce a protein that binds the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor with 10-fold higher affinity than EGF itself ( 3 ) .
This molecule , termed heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor ( HB-EGEF ) , is also produced by SMC and acts as a potent mitogen for SMC by an autocrine mechanism ( 4-6 ) .
HB-EGF is a 22-kDa single-chain polypeptide with an EGF-like domain and a heparin-binding domain ( 3 ) .
The cDNA as well as the gene for HB-EGF have been cloned ( 3 , 7 ) .
The synthesis of HB-EGF is up-regulated by a number of factors including lysophos-phatidylcholine , phorbol ester , angiotensin II , and thrombin ( 6 , 8 , 9 ) .
The mechanisms for transcriptional activation of HB-EGF expression , however , are not fully understood .
PAF , a biologically active phospholipid ( 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ) , is a substance released by many cells including monocyte/macrophages , endothelial cells , poly-morphonuclear cells , and platelets ( reviewed in Refs .
10 and 11 ) .
PAF exerts its effects through binding to specific receptors in target cells ( 12 , 13 ) .
Recent cloning of the PAF receptor indicates that it is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily ( 14-17 ) .
PAF has been suggested to play a role in atherogenesis and atherosclerosis , and clinical studies indicated higher levels of PAF in coronary artery samples from patients with severe atherosclerosis ( 18 , 19 ) .
A major part of the action of PAF during atherogenesis may be mediated by a juxtacrine intercellular signaling mechanism in which PAF synthesized by endothelial cells is attached to the surface of these cells , which could form a close interaction with leukocytes through P-selectin ( 20 ) .
This interaction may be important for the subsequent monocyte/macrophage activation , secretion of proliferative agents , migration between the endothelium , and eventually accumulation of lipid within the cells .
In the current study , we investigated the function of PAF in the regulation of expression of growth factors in monocytes and attempted to establish the relationship between the expression of HB-EGF and the activation of specific transcription factors .
Our results indicate that PAF is a strong inducer for HB-EGF expression in monocytes , and this function is associated with an enhanced « B binding activity suggesting potential involvement of NF- « B in PAF-induced gene regulation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Monocytes from Peripheral Blood-Heparinized human peripheral blood from health donors was fractionated on Percoll density gradients .
The cells were then harvested and washed , and monocytes were isolated using gelatin/plasma-coated flasks .
The purity of monocytes was greater than 95 % as determined by staining with the anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody MY4 .
Cell viability was greater than 98 % as measured by trypan blue exclusion .
Monocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium ( Irvine Scientific ) with 10 % ( v/v ) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum .
For isolation of total RNA and extraction of nuclear proteins , 5 x 10° cells were plated in 1 ml of the culture medium in sterile 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes .
The cells were incubated without serum for 12 h before stimulation with ligands .
RNA Extraction and Northern Blotting-Total RNA was isolated from monocytes by a modified guanidinium/acidic phenol method ( 21 ) .
In some experiments the cells were treated with various ligands as well 7787 7788 as the PAF antagonists WEB 2086 ( kindly provided by Boehringer Ingelheim , Ridgefield , CT ) or L-659,989 ( a gift from Merck & Co. ) .
About 20 ug of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gels containing 6 % formaldehyde and transferred to the Hybond-N plus membranes ( Amersham Corp. ) by the diffusion method .
A 616-base pair HindIII-Xbal fragment of the human HB-EGF cDNA was synthesized from U937 total RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reac-tion .
The sequences of the primers are : 5-ATG AAG CTT CTG CCG TCG GTG-3 and 5-TGT CTA GAT GCC CAA CTT CAC TTT CTC-3 .
The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and Xbal , and subcloned into the same sites in pBluescript SK ( + ) plasmid vector ( Stratagene ) .
For Northern hybridization , the fragment was labeled with [ *P ] dATP to a specific activity of > 5 x 10° cpm/ug of DNA by the random priming method ( 22 ) .
Blots were prehybridized in 6 x SSC , 5 x Denhardt 's solution , and 0.1 % SDS at 65 °C for 2 h and further hybridized with the *°P-labeled probe ( 1 x 10° cpm/ml ) for 16 h at the same temperature .
Filters were washed with 2 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 65 °C , followed by another wash with 0.1 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS .
The blots were exposed to Hyperfilm-MP ( Amersham Corp. ) with an intensifying screen .
Relative hybridization was analyzed for quantitation of actual radioactivity by a Phosphor-Imaging System ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
The quantity of samples in each lane was standardized against relative staining of the 18 and 28 S RNA after gel electrophoresis .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts-Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified method of Dignam et al .
( 23 ) .
Aliquots of monocytes ( 5 x 10° cells/sample ) were stimulated with different agents as indicated in the text , after which the cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline , harvested , and resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer A ( 10 my HEPES , pH 7.9 , 10 mm KCl , 1 mi dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM each of EDTA and EGTA , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride .
After 10 min , 23 ul of 10 % Nonidet P-40 was added and briefly mixed for 2 s. Nuclei were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 10 s and were resuspended in 50 Ll of buffer B ( 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 0.4 M NaCl , 1 ma EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride .
After 30 min at 4 °C , lysates were separated by centrifugation ( 13,000 x g , 30 s ) and the supernatants containing nuclear proteins were transferred to new vials .
Samples were diluted to equal concentration in buffer B. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described . ''
Briefly , 2.5 ug of nuclear extracts were added to 12 pl of binding buffer ( 5 mm HEPES , pH 7.8 , 5 mm MgCl , , 50 mm KCl , 0.5 mi dithiothreitol , 0.4 mg/ml poly ( dI-dC ) , 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA , and 10 % glycerol ) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature .
Approximately 20-50 fmol of *°P-labeled oligonucleotide probe ( 30,000-50,000 cpm ) was added , and the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature .
The samples were analyzed on 5 % acrylamide gel , made with buffers containing either 50 mit Tris borate , 1 mm EDTA ( TBE ) or 50 mit Tris , 380 mit glycine , 2 mit EDTA ( TGE ) .
After pre-electrophore-sis for 2 h at 12 V/cm , electrophoresis was carried out at the same voltage for 2-2.5 h. The gel contents were transferred to Whatman DE-81 paper , dried , and exposed to either x-ray film or PhosphorImager screen .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Stimulation of HB-EGF Gene Expression by PAF-Macro-phage-like U-937 cells produce HB-EGF in response to treatment with PMA , which has also been shown to be an inducer of the HB-EGF mRNA in SMC ( 3 , 4 ) .
We investigated the effect of PAF , generated at the site of vascular injury during atherogenesis , on HB-EGF gene transcription in human monocytes .
The expression of the HB-EGF message was examined by hybridization of a -labeled human HB-EGF cDNA probe to total RNA isolate from human monocytes ( Fig .
1A ) .
A major species of 2.5 kilobases was found in cells stimulated with PMA ( lane 2 ) , TNFa ( lane 3 ) , or PAF ( lane 4 ) but not in untreated monocytes ( lane 1 ) .
Although the base-line level of HB-EGF mRNA was very low , it increased rapidly after stimulation with PAF and was maintained for at least 4 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
PAF increased HB-EGF mRNA in a dose-dependent manner , with a maximal response achieved in approximately 10 nm PAF ( Fig .
1B ) .

PAF-induced expression of HB-EGF gene in monocytes .
Cells were stimulated under various conditions before RNA extraction .
Total RNA ( 20 ug ) were subject to Northern blot analysis with a *°P-labeled human HB-EGF probe .
A , autoradiograph of Northern blot with RNA from monocytes treated with medium alone , PMA ( 100 ni ) , TNFa ( 40 ng/ml ) , and PAF ( 100 nm ) for 60 min , as indicated .
B , dose- and time-dependent expression of HB-EGF mRNA .
Total RNA was extracted from cells stimulated with different doses of PAF for 60 min ( lanes 1-4 ) or after stimulation with 100 nM PAF at the time points indicated ( Zanes 5-8 ) .
C , effect of actinomycin D ( ActD ) on HB-EGF gene transcription .
The cells were stimulated with 100 nm PAF in the absence ( lane 2 ) or presence ( lane 3 ) of 1 ug/ml actinomycin D for 60 min before extraction of RNA .
The bottom part of panel A is a photograph of the same gel before transfer to membrane , with the relative molecular sizes marked by the 18 and 28 S RNA species .
Sample loading was similarly controlled for Northern blots shown in other figure panels .
RNA synthesis , blocked PAF-stimulated increase of the HB-EGF mRNA ( Fig .
1C ) .
These results suggest that stimulation at the transcriptional level contributes to PAF-induced up-regulation of the HB-EGF message .
Effect of PAF Receptor Antagonists and a Bacterial Toxin on HB-EGF Gene Expression-To investigate whether PAF 's effect on HB-EGF gene expression is mediated by the specific cell surface PAF receptor , we employed the PAF receptor antagonists , L-659,989 and WEB 2086 ( 24 , 25 ) .
Monocytes were pretreated with L-659,989 ( 1 um ) or WEB 2086 ( 10 um ) prior to stimulation by PAF ( 100 nm ) .
As shown in Fig .
24 , both antagonists markedly inhibited PAF-induced HB-EGF expression in monocytes ( lanes 1 and 3 ) .
In contrast , neither antagonist had an effect on PMA-induced expression of HB-EGF in the same cells ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
Treatment of the cells with the antagonists alone did not induce HB-EGF gene expression ( not shown ) .
PAF has been shown to bind a receptor that functionally couples to G proteins ( 12 , 13 ) , and recent cloning of the PAF receptor confirmed that it possesses a typical structure for G protein-coupled receptors ( 14-17 ) .
We examined whether PAF-induced HB-EGF mRNA synthesis is subject to inhibition by bacterial toxins that ADP-ribosylate ' the a-subunits of certain ( G proteins ( Fig .
2B ) .
Our results indicate that pertussis toxin ( PTX ) significantly reduced PAF-induced HB-EGF message up-regulation ( Zane 4 ) , while cholera toxin ( CTX ) has no such inhibitory effect in monocytes ( lane 5 ) .
Neither of the two toxins inhibited PMA-induced expression of the HB-EGF gene ( lanes 5 and 7 ) .
In a preliminary study of the potential mechanisms for PAF-stimulated gene expression , we investigated the requirement for protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity in PAF-induced HB-EGF expression .
Monocytes were treated with herbimycin A and staurosporine , inhibitors for PTK and PKC , respectively .
Herbimycin A treatment ( 1 um , 40 min ) completely inhibited PAF-induced HB-EGF gene expression ( Fig .
2C , lane 3 ) .
Similar results were obtained with staurosporine ( lane 4 ) , suggesting the functions of protein kinases in this process .

Effect of PAF antagonists , bacterial toxins , and protein kinase inhibitors on PAF-induced HB-EGF gene expression .
Northern blot with total RNA ( 20 ug/lane ) isolated after treatment of the cells as indicated below is shown .
A , cells were pretreated for 30 min with L-659,989 ( 10 un ; lanes 1 and 2 ) and WEB 2086 ( 10 um ; lanes 3 and 4 ) before stimulation for 60 min with PAF ( 100 nm ; lanes 1 and 3 ) or PMA ( 100 ni ; lanes 2 and 4 ) .
B , cells were pretreated for 4 h with PTX ( 500 ng/ml ) or CTX ( 5 ug/ml ) , followed by stimulation for 60 min with either PAF ( 100 ni ) or PMA ( 100 ni ) .

C , cells were pretreated for 40 min with herbimycin A ( HA , 1 um , lane 3 ) or staurosporine ( STSP , 200 nM , lane 4 ) , followed by PAF ( 100 nm ) stimulation for 60 min .
Lane 1 , no PAF or inhibitor treatment ; lane 2 , PAF only .
couples extracellular signals to gene-activating events .
The pro-totypic NF-kB is a heterodimer consisting of p50 and p65 sub-units and exists in the cytoplasm in an inactive form due to association with the specific inhibitor protein IB .
Phosphorylation of IxB by candidate kinases leads to the release and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF- « B , which then binds a decam-eric DNA sequence originally identified in the x light chain enhancer of immunoglobulin ( 26 ) .
The potential involvement of PTK and PKC in HB-EGF gene expression prompted us to examine the possible induction of kB binding activity by PAF and its relationship to the expression of the HB-EGF gene in monocytes .
Our results demonstrated that PAF stimulated a rapid rise in « B binding activity , observed within 20 min , peaked at 1 h , and returned to base line after 5 h ( Fig .
34 , lanes 10-14 ) .
PAF induced « B binding activity in a concentration-dependent manner proportional to the concentrations required for the expression of the HB-EGF gene ( Fig .
34 , lanes 5-9 ) .
Maximal response was obtained at 10 nm PAF , and a higher concentration of PAF ( 100 nmi ) did not produce an additional increase in the « kB binding activity .
The PAF receptor antagonists L-659,989 and WEB 2086 both blocked « B binding activity stimulated by PAF ( Fig .
3B , lanes 3 and 4 ) but not that stimulated by PMA ( Fig .
3B , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
When the cells were treated with bacterial toxins as described above , PTX blocked PAF-induced « B binding activity but not that induced by PMA , whereas CTX had no inhibitory effect ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that PAF could induce « B binding activity in monocytes through a receptor-mediated and G protein-coupled pathway .
We next examined the effect of herbimycin A and staurosporine on PAF-induced « B binding activity .
Both protein kinase inhibitors , at concentrations that blocked HB-EGF gene expression , produced a marked decrease in the kB binding activity ( not shown ) .
Our data suggested the possible involvement of PTK and PKC in PAF-stimulated « kB binding activity in monocytes .
Results presented above demonstrated parallel stimulation of the HB-EGF gene expression and « B binding activity upon PAF stimulation .
To determine whether HB-EGF gene expression could be the result of PAF-induced « B binding activity , we examined the effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) on both the gene expression and « B binding activity in PAF-stimulated monocytes .
PDTC is an antioxidant that selectively blocks the dissociation of IxB from the cytoplasmic NF- « B , thus preventing the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kB ( 27 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4 , PDTC treatment of monocytes significantly inhibited the « kB binding activity induced by PAF ( Fig .
4A ) .

induced expression of the HB-EGF transcript .
These results suggest that transcription factor ( s ) with kB binding activity participate in PAF-stimulated HB-EGF gene transcription .
HB-EGF was originally purified from conditioned medium of cultured human mononuclear cells ( 28 ) and the monocytic U-937 cell line ( 3 ) .
It was subsequently found that HB-EGF could be transcribed in vascular endothelial cells ( 29 ) and smooth muscle cells ( 6 ) ; both are associated with atherogenesis .
HB-EGF is a more potent mitogen than EGF for smooth muscle cell proliferation ( 3 ) .
The expression of HB-EGF in these cells is highly regulated .
It has been shown that factors that participate in atherogenesis , such as TNFa and thrombin , also up-regulate the expression of HB-EGF .
In spite of these findings , the transcription factors involved in HB-EGF gene expression have not been identified .
Characterization of the gene for the human HB-EGF revealed a 2-kilobase DNA fragment that contains promoter activity and a potential AP-1 site ( 7 ) .
The sequence of this AP-1 site , however , contains a single residue mismatch ( 7 ) that was found in a separate study to be defective in binding Fos and Jun ( 30 ) .
Although it was not clear from the above study whether there are « kB sites upstream of the HB-EGF gene , results reported here suggest that transcription factors with kB binding capability may contribute to the transcription of HB-EGF in monocytes .
NF- « B is a well character 7790 ized transcription factor whose activity in non-B lymphocytes is regulated by agents including those associated with inflammation and atherogenic lesions ( 31 ) .
Thus , the stimulating effect of several atherogenic factors on endothelial and smooth muscle cells may be mediated in part through NF- « B activation and up-regulation of growth factor synthesis .
PAF has long been suggested to play a role in atherogenesis and atherosclerotic lesions .
Only recently , however , has evidence begun to accumulate suggesting the function of PAF in gene regulation ( 32 ) .
Our results indicate that PAF at nanomolar concentrations is fully capable of stimulating « B binding activity .
This action of PAF appears to be mediated by the cell surface PAF receptor , which couples to a G protein sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment .
The signal transduction mechanism for transcription factor activation by G protein-coupled receptors remains to be explored .
Our preliminary results indicate that PAF-mediated « B binding activity involves kinase activa-tion ; thus it is likely that multiple signal transduction pathways lead to the phosphorylation and degradation of IxB .
Although in physiological conditions PAF released by cells is rapidly degraded ( 33 , 34 ) , prolonged exposure of leukocytes to PAF could be achieved by the recently discovered juxtacrine intercellular signaling mechanism in which newly synthesized PAF is presented on the surface of endothelial cells that interact with peripheral blood leukocytes as well as residential monocytes and macrophages ( 35 , 36 ) .
Because of the subendo-thelial localization of monocyte/macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions , sustained high level synthesis of HB-EGF is possible through the juxtacrine activation of the cells tethered by P-selectin and stimulated by endothelial cell surface-associated PAF .
We are currently investigating this possibility as well as the transcription factors involved in the process .
