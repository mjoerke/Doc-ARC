P. ] ABSTRACT In previous studies , it was shown that the fusion region of the pmI/RAR- « protein , expressed by acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cells , can be specifically recognized in vitro by donor ( D. E. ) CD4 T cells in a HLA class II DR11-restricted fashion .
We present here the results on the recognition of several pmIl/RAR- « peptides by APL patients expressing HLA DR11 .
The in vitro immunization of peripheral blood lymphocytes from four patients in remission ( S. R. , F. R. , M. M. , P. G. ) with BCR1/25 , a 25-mer pmV/ RAR- « , did not elicit either a polyclonal or a clonal immune response specific to the peptide .
We then generated new donor anti-pmI/RAR- « CD4* T-cell clones .
These clones were tested for their recognition of BCR1/25 .
One clone ( C3/5 , CD3* , CD4* , CD87 ) was selected for further analysis .
Clone C3/5 showed specific proliferation , cytotoxicity , and cytokine ( tumor necrosis factor & , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) production when challenged with autologous lymphoblastic cell lines pulsed with peptide BCR1/25 .
C3/5 cells developed specific proliferation and cytotoxicity when challenged with peptide-pulsed lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes from the four DR11* APL patients .
APL blasts , available only from patients F. R. and P. G. , were not lysed by C3/5 and were unable to present peptide BCR1/25 .
Incubation of APL cells with IFN-y failed to induce HLA class II molecules and recognition by the C3/5 clone .
Since APL cells do not express HLA class II molecules , we tested in two donors ( D. E. and C. H. R. ) and in patients S. R. and P. G. whether the use of 9-mer peptides ( BCR1/9 ) would generate a CD8/HLA class I-restricted response .

INTRODUCTION The pmIl/RAR-a « fusion protein , specifically expressed in APL ( 1-4 ) cells , creates a new tumor-specific amino acid sequence .
It has been shown that a 25-mer peptide ( BCR1/25 ) , encompassing the fusion region , contains an antigenic site ( ab-sent in the normal parent molecules ) recognizable by CD4* T-cell clones of a healthy donor ( D. E. ) in an HLA DRI1-restricted fashion on presentation by autologous APCs ( 5 , 6 ) .
Antipeptide CD4 clones also recognize pmI/RAR-a-transfected LCLs ( 6 ) .
The possible recognition of the pmI/RAR-a « protein by T lymphocytes of APL patients would open the possibility of directing the patient 's immune system against the leukemic cells through the recognition of a tumor-specific/transformation-related molecule ( 5 ) .
Although binding motifs for most DR molecules were not known at the time of the study , our previous data ( 6 ) indicated that DR 11 functions as a restriction element in this case .
For this reason , we focused on the analysis of DR1 1 * of DR11 APL patients .
In the present work , we studied the in vitro immune response of peripheral blood lymphocytes from four HLA DRI 1 * APL patients to several pmI/RAR-a « peptides .
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients Four APL patients were studied after informed consent was obtained .
Three patients ( F. R. , S. R. , and P. G. ) were in first remission , and one patient ( M. M. ) was in second remission .
Two patients ( S. R. and M. M. ) underwent autologous bone marrow | transplantation : ; the conditioning regimen included high-dose chemotherapy but not total-body irradiation .
At the time of the study , patients had not received treatment for at least 6 months , and their peripheral counts were within normal ranges .

594 Immune Recognition of the pmI/RAR- « Protein PBMCs Peripheral blood was obtained from two healthy donors ( D. E. and C. H. R. ) and four APL patients in remission ( S. R. , F. R. , M. M. , and P. G. ) after informed consent .
PBMCs were isolated by centrifugation on Ficoll gradients .
The HLA typing was as follows : DE ( A2,23 , B49,35 , DR1I1.13 ) , CHR ( A2,11 , B35,60 , DR1,4 ) , SR ( A1,24 , B51 , DR8,11 ) , FR ( A23 , B49,51 , DR4,1 1 ) , MM ( A23,10 , B27,49 , DR10,11 ) , and PG ( A1,2 , B15 , DR1,11 ) .
Cell Lines Lymphoblastoid cell lines ( DE.LCL , SR.LCL , FRLCL , MM.LCL , PG.LCL , and CHR.LCL ) were prepared from PBMCs as previously described ( 6 ) .
LAK cell lines were prepared by culturing PBMCs with recombinant IL-2 ( 10 units/ml ; Euro-Cetus BV , Amsterdam , the Netherlands ) .
The Daudi cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Biowhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) plus 10 % FCS ( Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beth Haemek , Israel ) .
FR.APL cells were obtained from bone marrow or peripheral blood of an APL patient ( F. R. ) and frozen in liquid nitrogen .
They were thawed and cultured for 18 to 24 h before use in proliferation or cytotoxicity tests .
Peptides The following peptides were used : BCR1/25 , a 25-mer ( NSNHVASGAGEAAIETQSSSSEEIV ) peptide , and a pool of nine different 9-mer peptides ( VASGAGEAA , ASGAGEAAL , SGAGEAAIE , GAGEAAIET , AGEAAIETQ , GEAAIETQS , EAAIETQSS , AAIETQSSS , and AIETQSSSS ) collectively indicated as BCR1/9 .
They encompass the BCR ! 1-type fusion region of the pmI/RAR- « protein ( 4 ) .
The peptides were synthesized by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center ( Madison , WI ) or American Peptide Company ( Sunnyvale , CA ) and purified using high-performance liquid chromatography to a minimum purity of 95 % .
Activation of Lymphocytes The protocol described by Chen et al .
( 7 ) was followed .
In brief , 50 X 10° fresh PBMCs ( 10° for patient P. G. and donor C. H. R. ) were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C in 5 % CO , with 20 jum corresponding peptides at 5 X 10° cells/ml serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 1 h. Fresh autologous PBMCs ( 50 % 10° cells in 10 ml RPMI 1640 medium + 10 % HS ) were added to each APC culture in culture flasks ( 75 cm-* ) .
The flasks were incubated upright for 7 days .
Primed lymphocytes were then harvested and restimulated with irradiated ( 3000 rad ) autologous PBMC-pulsed peptides ( 20 jm ) at a lymphocyte : APC ratio of 1:3 .
The next day , IL-2 ( 10 units/ml ) was added , and the percentage of HS was increased to 10 % .
Five days later , one half of the medium from each culture was replaced with RPMI 1640 + 10 % HS + 10 units/ml IL-2 .
The derived T-cell lines were left in culture for 7 days before cloning on day 21 poststimulation .
They were maintained in culture by periodic stimulation ( every 7-10 days ) using irradiated ( 8000 rad ) autologous LCL-pulsed peptide ( 20 jm ) and IL-2 ( 10 units/ml ) .
To test for proliferative activity of the derived T-cell lines , cells were washed and placed in U-bottomed 96-well plates ( 5 x 10° cells/well ) .
They were stimulated with irradiated ( 8000 rad ) autologous LCLs ( 10° cells/well ) in the presence or absence of the appropriate peptides .
LCL cells were washed three times in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium , incubated with 20 pum peptides as indicated above , and then irradiated .
After 48 h of culture , the plates were labeled with [ °H } dThd , further cultured for 18 h , harvested , and counted in a beta counter .
Generation of Lymphocyte Clones Primed T-cell lines were cloned on day 21 by limiting dilution ( 20 , 10 , 5 , 2 , and 1 cell/well/200 pi RPMI 1640 + 10 % HS ) in 96-well U-bottomed plates .
Autologous LCLs , PBLs , and allogeneic PBLs ( 25 x 10° cells/well ) were used as a feeder layer .
Autologous PBLs and LCLs were incubated separately in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium ( 5 X 10° cells/ml ) with 20 pm of the same mixture of peptides , used to prime lymphocytes ( see above ) , for 30 min at 37°C before irradiation ( 3000 rad for PBL s and 8000 rad for LCL cells ) .
X-irradiated ( 3000 rad ) allogeneic PBLs and IL-2 ( 50 units/ml ) were also added to the wells .
The plates were incubated for 14 days ; 100 w !
fresh medium and 50 units/ml IL-2 were replaced in each well every 3 days .
Wells with positive signs of growth were selected for expansion ( see '*Results '' ' ) .
The probability of clonality for each well containing growth was calculated as described previously ( 6 ) .
Growing clones were transferred to 96-well flat-bottomed plates , and each clone was stimulated with 25 X 10° irradiated ( 8000 rad ) autologous LCLs pulsed with the appropriate peptides ( 20 wm ) and 25 x 10° ( 3000 rad ) irradiated allogeneic PBLs .
IL-2 ( 50 units/ml ) was added to the wells after 1 day .
This activation cycle was repeated after 7-10 days of culture at lymphocyte : autologous LCL : allogeneic PBL ratios of 1:1:1. unless otherwise indicated .
Screening of Clones The following assays were carried out .
Proliferation Assay .
T-cell clones were first screened for proliferative activity 28 days after cloning .
Each well was washed off to remove IL-2 and split into three .
The first one was expanded for further culture .
The second well was stimulated with irradiated ( 8000 rad ) autologous LCLs ( 10° cells/well ) pulsed with the appropriate peptides ( 20 pm ) .
The third well was incubated with irradiated LCLs without peptides .
Cells were cultured for 48 h , incubated for an additional 18 h with [ °H ] dThd ( 1 pCi/well ) , and harvested .
In subsequent experiments , the incubation time was reduced to 24 h ( see `` Results '' ' ) .
Cytotoxic Assay .
T-cell clones were first screened for cytotoxic activity 6 weeks after cloning : ; one third of the cell suspension from each clone was admixed with °'Cr-labeled autologous LCL s ( 10° cell/well ) as a control , and the other third was incubated with LCLs pulsed with peptide ( 20 pum ) .
The assay was performed as previously described ( 6 ) .
The incubation time was 4-6 h. Spontaneous release never exceeded 15 % .
Anti-TNF-a monoclonal antibody ( Farmitalia , Milan , Italy ) and TNF-a ( EuroCetus BV ) were used in some assays ( see *'Results '' ' ) .
Cytokine Production and Detection Assays Cells from clone C3/5 ( 3 X 10° cells ) were cultured in 48-well plates ( 1.5 X 10° cells/ml ) with irradiated ( 8000 rad ) autologous DE.LCL ( 3 X 10° cells ) in the presence or absence Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

of 20 jum peptide ( 25-mer ) .
C3/5 cells ( 3 X 10° ) were also cultured in 2 ml RPMI 1640 + 10 % HS in the absence of LCLs .
The supernatant from each culture ( 2 ml ) was collected by centrifugation after 1 and 2 days .
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at -80°C until used .
The cytokines assayed in the present study were : IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IFN-y , TNF-a , and GM-CSF .
IL-2 activity was measured by [ °H ] dThd uptake of IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocyte line cells as previously described ( Ref .
8 , 1 unit biological activity was referred as half-maximal proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte line cells ) .
In brief , serial dilutions of IL-2 or supernatant from each culture were incubated in 200 ul for 24 h , followed by an overnight pulse of 1 p.Ci/well of [ °H ] dThd .
IL-3 was assayed by using a Quantikine Human IL-3 Immunoassay ( Research and Diagnostic Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) with a detection limit of 30 pg/ml .
IL-4 and IFN-y were measured using the sandwich ELISA as described in detail elsewhere ( 9 ) .

IL-6 and TNF- were analyzed using kits from Chromogenix AB ( Moilndal , Sweden ) , with a detection limit of 4 pg/ml as given by the manufacturer .
The human GM-CSF was assayed using Innotest human GM-CSF from Innogenetics NV ( Antwerp , Belgium ) with a detection limit of 8 pg/ml .
PHA and TT Assays PBLs were simultaneously thawed , washed , and seeded at 10° cells/well .
PHA ( Murex , Temple Hile , England ) was added at 1 pg/ml , and proliferation was assessed as [ °H ] dThd uptake ( 6-h incubation ) after 72 h. For proliferation to TT ( 10 pg/ml ; Connaugh Lab ) , 2 X 10° PBLs/well were cultured for 6 days and labeled with [ °H ] dThd for the last 18 h of culture .
Immunofluorescence Assay This assay was performed as previously described ( 11 ) .
The MAbs used were in the form of diluted ascites : anti-CD3 , anti-CD4 , anti-CD8 , anti-TCR-aB , anti-TCR-y8 , anti-HLA class I ( W6/32 ) , and anti-HLA class II ( D1-12 ) .
Samples were analyzed using flow cytometry ( FACs IV : Becton Dickinson , Sunnyvale , CA ) with a logarithmic signal amplification .

LCLs at 5 X 10° cells/ml were incubated with *'Cr for 90 min with or without peptides ( 20 jum ) .
After washing , the peptides were readded to the target ( 10° cells/well ) at the same concentration .
DE/9/25 , respectively .
Among the 52 SR/9 and the 41 SR/25 clones tested , no specific cytotoxic or proliferative activity was obtained .
Proliferation against LCLs pulsed with control peptides or with PBS was observed in several clones , suggesting autoreactivity or anti~EBV reactivity ( data not shown ) .
Among the 122 clones obtained from the DE/9/25 T-cell line , 59 were selected according to their specific proliferation ( SI > 2 ) or cytotoxicity ( specific lysis > 10 % ) .
Fifty-five clones showed specific proliferation to the peptide pool ( SI ranged from 2 to 16.47 ) with four clones showing specific lysis also [ B9/5 ( 17 % ) , C3/1 ( 20 % ) , C35 ( 19 % ) , and C4/1 ( 13 % ) ] .
An additional four clones showed specific lysis only [ A4/5 ( 19 % ) , E2/1 ( 10.5 % ) , E3/1 ( 23 % ) , and F2/1 ( 15 % ) ] .
The phenotype of these clones was uniformly CD3 , CD4* , CD8~T , TCR-w/B* , and TCR-y/6 ~ .
One clone ( C3/5 ) , which showed the highest and the most stable results , was selected for further analysis .
In subsequent experiments the proliferative and cytotoxic activity of the C3/5 clone against BCR 1/25 and BCR1/9 was evaluated .
BCR1/9 did not induce specific proliferation ( data not shown ) , indicating that BCR 1/25 was the peptide recognized in the peptide mixture initially used for stimulation .
The results for the cytotoxic activity of C3/5 against autologous LCLs pulsed separately with BCR1/25 and BCR1/9 are shown in Fig .

T-cell clones were also produced , with the same stimulation protocol and using combined or separate stimulation with BCR1/25 and BCR1/9 , from three additional DR11*~ APL patients ( F. R. , M. M. , and P. G. ) and with BCR 1/9 from donors C. H. R. , L. R. , and B. C. A total of 1015 clones ( 155 from patient F. R. , 106 from patient M. M. , 251 from patient P. G. , Days in culture Fig .
3 Specific cytokine production by the C3/5 clone .
Cells ( 1.5 % 10°/ml ) were cultured with irradiated ( 8000 rad ) autologous DE.LCL ( 1.5 X 10° cells/ml ) in the presence ( @ and ¥ ) or absence ( 0 and V ) of the BCR1/25 peptide ( 20 jum ) .
Supernatants were harvested on days 1 and 2 and assayed for the presence of TNF-a ( O and @ ) and GM-CSF ( V and ¥ ) .
198 from donor C. H. R. , 227 from donor L. R. , and 188 from donor B. C. ) was obtained and screened .
No specific proliferative or cytotoxic activity was observed , while a specific response was obtained from donors ' PBLs ( all being HLA-A2* ) in response to the influenza peptide GILGFVFTL ( data not shown ) .
Specific Cytokine Production by the C3/5 Clone in Response to Autologous Peptide-pulsed LCLs .
To assess cytokine production , cells from the C3/5 clone were stimulated with autologous DE.LCL in the presence or absence of the BCR1/25 peptide ( 20 um ) , and cytokine production was measured after 1 and 2 days of culture .
IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IFN-y , TNF-a , and GM-CSF were assayed .
IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-6 , and IFN-y levels were undetectable or below the detection limit of the assay used ( data not shown ) .
C3/5 cells cultured with autologous DE.LCL-puised peptide for 1 day secreted significant amounts of TNF-a ( 933 , 1189 pg/ml ) and GM-CSF ( 3395 , 3301 pg/ml ) in two separate experiments compared with those stimulated with DE.LCL in the absence of peptide ( 26 pg/ml or below the detection limit for TNF- « and 184 , 126 pg/ml for GM-CSF ) .
TNF-a and GM-CSF production peaked at day 1 and remained stable at day 2 ( Fig .
3 ) .
To test whether TNF- « produced by the C3/5 clone could be involved in its cytolytic activity , TNF-a and anti-TNF-e MAb were used .
The addition of anti- TNF-a at different concentrations 0.1 , 1 , and 10 pg/ml to the target cells DE.LCL in the presence or absence of the peptide , did not inhibit the cytolytic activity exerted by the €3/5 clone ( Fig .
4 ) .
The antibody was instead active in inhibiting the cytotoxic activity of TNF-a against the TNF-o-sensitive WEHI 164 cell line ( data not shown ) .
TNF-a , at 1-1000 units/ml , had no cytolytic activity on DE.LCL cells when added for the same Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

Cells from the C3/5 clone were challenged with autologous DE.LCL in the absence of peptide ( 0 ) and in the presence of 20 um BCR1/25 peptide ( @ ) .

duration of the cytotoxic assay ( data not shown ) .
The results indicate that cytotoxic activity and TNF-a release probably represent two separate functions in clone €3/5 , although both are specifically induced by BCR1/25 .
Reactivity of C3/5 toward HLA-DR11 Allogeneic APLs , LCLs , and PBLs .
- Five allogeneic LCLs [ SR , FR , MM , PG ( sharing DR11 with DE and obtained from APL patients ) and CHR ( DR11T ) ] were subjected to a cytotoxic test in the presence or absence of BCR 1/25 ( 20 um ) at different E : T ratios .
The results are shown in Fig .
5 .
The C3/5 clone specifically lysed DR11-matched SR , FR , and MM [ and PG ( data not shown ) ] LCLs pulsed with BCR1/25 , as well as the autologous DE.LCL .
CHR cells failed to present the peptide to the C3/5 clone .
The ability of the C3/5 clone to proliferate to the autologous DE.LCL and HLA-DR11-matched SR , FR , MM , and PG.LCL pulsed with different peptide concentrations was also investi-gated .
A preliminary experiment was carried out to determine the optimal stimulation period giving the highest proliferative activity of clone C3/5 at this stage of culture .
Cells were cultured for 24 , 48 , and 72 h with autologous irradiated ( 8000 rad ) DE.LCL in the presence ( 2 and 20 m ) or absence of the BCR1/25 peptide , incubated for an additional 18 h with [ °H ] JdThd , and harvested .
As shown in Fig .
64 , the 24 h- time point gave the highest cpm count ( P < 0.05 using the ?
test analysis ) .
The proliferative activity of the C3/5 clone against autologous and allogeneic LCL-pulsed peptide ( 0 , 5 , 20 , and 50 M ) was subsequently studied at the 24-h time point ( Fig .
6B ) .
All DR11* peptide-pulsed LCLs stimulated the C3/5 clone in a dose-dependent fashion ( PG.PBL induced an uptake of 38,500 90 } so - m- ~ E To - _/ © _ / _3 50 - //o GA 40 -| ® ___ -A a v QSG '' v_/// ” — ( 0 / r 20 { V7 .

Although some discrepancies between proliferation and cytotoxicity were observed ( SR and MM.LCL induced a good proliferative response but produced low levels of cytotoxicity , while FR.LCL induced little proliferation but was very efficiently lysed by €3/5 ) , all four APL patients ' LCLs were able to present peptide BCR1/25 to C3/5 .
The ability of LCLs derived from APL patients to present peptide BCR1/25 to C3/5 suggests that the failure in raising anti-pmI/RAR- « clones from the four APL patients was probably not due to a defect in antigen presentation capability .
To further investigate this point , this experiment was replicated using patients ' PBLs ( instead of LCLs ) as APCs .
The results are presented in Table 1 , and confirm that the antigen presentation capability in the APL patients studied was grossly intact .
Since the C3/5 clone was specifically able to lyse FR.LCL cells pulsed with the BCR1/25 peptide in a HLA class II ( DR11 ) restriction fashion , we further tested whether this clone could exert a cytotoxic activity against FR.APL cells .
Because APL cells are usually DR~ , FR.blasts ( 285 % leukemic cells ) were also cultured with IFN-y ( a cytokine known to induce or enhance the expression of HLA class II molecules ) before being used .
The results are present in Fig .
7 .
C3/5 cells did not lyse FR.APL blasts and the culture of FR.APL cells with IFN-y ( 10° units/ml ) for 48 h before the experiment did not enhance the cytolytic activity .
This was possibly due to the failure of IFN-y to induce HLA class II molecules on FR.APL blasts as assayed by immunofluorescence ( data not shown ) .
FR.APL cells were also unable to present peptide BCR1/25 even after IFN-y pre-incubation .

PHA and TT Responses of Patients ' PBLs .
Because of the negative results obtained with lymphocytes from APL patients , a PHA response assay was performed to test the T-cell response in these patients .
Results are presented in Table 2 and show that , compared to PBLs from two normal donors ( D. E. and C. H. R. ) , patients ' PBLs showed a dramatically reduced response .
These results were surprising to us , since all patients were studied while in remission and off treatment for > 6 months ( F. R. was in complete remission and off therapy for > 2 years ) .
Comparable results were obtained when response to a specific antigen ( TT ) was evaluated .

Screening of the pml/RAR- « Fusion Region for HLA Class I-binding Motifs .
Although donor lymphocytes can recognize pmI/RAR-a « peptides in a DR-restricted fashion , attempts at generating class T-restricted CTLs in two donors ( and in two patients ) failed .
We recently obtained the binding motifs for the 35 most frequent class I alleles and matched these motifs against the sequence of the pmI/RAR- « fusion region .
No good matching was identified , '' suggesting the lack of binding motifs for the class I HLA molecules most frequently encountered in the general population .
To provide partial confirmation to these negative findings , BCRI1/9 peptides were separately used in HLA stabilization experiments .
Different cell lines ( see *'Patients and Methods '' '' ) were used , enabling us to assess binding to HLA-A2,3 , B5101,63 , and Cw0701,0702 .
Appropriate positive control peptides ( natural ligands ) were included and induced an increase in the mean channel of fluorescence of 150 % ( A0201 ) , 500 % ( A0301 ) , and 269 % ( Cw0702 ) .
All BCR1/9 peptides induced increments of < 20 % ( or no increase at all ) over values obtained with control unrelated peptides .
DISCUSSION The data presented here demonstrate specific proliferation , cytotoxicity , and cytokine production by HLA-DR11* donor CD4 T-cell clones upon challenge with HLA-DR1L LCLs or PBLs pulsed with the BCR1/25 peptide ; no BCR1/9 peptide-specific CD8/HLA class I-restricted response could be generated in both donors and patients .
We also showed that these clones could not be obtained in four HLA-DR 11 * APL patients , and that APL blasts from DR11 patients were not recognized by a DRI 1-restricted CD4 T-cell clone and were unable to present peptide BCR1/25 .
These results raise several questions regarding the possible recognition of the APL-specific pmI/RAR-a molecule by T cells .
On one side , our results confirm previous findings that donor T cells can recognize a peptide encompassing the fusion region of the pmI/RAR- « molecule ( 6 ) .
Previous data indicate that the cellular processing of the pmI/RAR- « protein can produce peptides that stimulate anti-BCR1/25 clones ( 6 ) .
Here , we show that BCR1/25-specific T-cell clones can also exert a specific cytotoxic activity and release cytokines upon stimulation with the peptide .
We also present evidence that cytotoxic activity and TNF-a release by these clones are separate functions , although both seem to be BCR1/25 specific .
* C. Gambacorti-Passerini , unpublished results .
Finally , LCLs and PBLs derived from APL patients expressing the relevant restriction element ( HLA-DR 11 ) are able to present BCR1/25 similar to autologous LCLs .
On the other side , two different sets of data have to be considered .
First , repeated attempts at generating anti-BCR1/25 T-cell clones in four DR11+* APL patients were not successful .
These results can not be attributed to an insufficient antigen-presenting capability in these patients , since their LCLs and PBL s induced proliferation and cytotoxicity in the €3/5 clone in the presence of BCR1/25 similar to autologous LCLs .
However , it is possible that the frequency and/or the responsiveness of anti-BCR1/25 lymphocytes was particularly low in these patients , even if PBLs were recovered when the patients were in remission with normal peripheral blood counts and T-cell subsets values .
The results of the PHA and TT response assays strongly support this conclusion and indicate that a generalized impairment of the cellular immune system , already reported in cancer patients ( 15 ) , can be present even during long-term remissions .
The molecular analysis of the observed hyporespon-siveness is presently under investigation in our laboratory .
The possible deletion or suppression of anti-pmIl/RAR- « -specific T-cell clones by APL cells is another possibility that deserves further investigation as well as ways to increase the in vivo frequency of anti-pmI/RAR-a precursors in APL patients .
The failure to generate anti-BCR1/25-specific clones in APL patients represents the most relevant problem to be solved before therapeutic approaches can be considered .
Second , in both APL patients and healthy donors we were unable to raise CD8 , HLA class-I restricted T-cell clones .
This is of particular importance given the usual and strong suppression of the DR gene expression in APL cells .
Although our strategy of pulsing APCs with short peptides could not have been successful for technical reasons , it produced positive results in other systems ( 16 ) and against known immunogenic peptides .
It has been demonstrated that inhibitory peptides competitively block the binding to HLA molecules of stimulatory peptides ( 17 ) .
Since a mixture of 9-mer peptides was used in our experiments , peptide cross-inhibition can not be excluded .
The use of different stimulation protocols ( e.g. , using pmI/RAR- « -transfected cells ) or APCs ( like dendritic cells ) could produce positive results .
These results can also be explained by the observed lack of effective binding motifs for HLA class I molecules in the pmI/RAR- « junction .
A recent article by Bocchia et al .
( 18 ) , analyzing HLA binding to two pmIl/RAR- « peptides , is consistent with such an hypothesis .
Thus , it is possible that in APL , the pmI/RAR- « protein is recognized by T lymphocytes , but only when presented by a restriction element ( HLA-DR11 ) that is not present on the APL cells themselves .
The recognition of putative DR* APL stem cells in the form of colony-forming units could still be possible .
However , the existence of these cells has yet to be demonstrated ( 19 ) , and true APL colonies are difficult to obtain ( 20 ) .
Alter-natively , the induction of DR molecules on APL cells could permit an efficient immune recognition ( 20 ) .
The lack of expression of DR molecules by APL cells and the resulting inability of DR11* APL cells to present pml/ RAR-a peptides could also be reflected by the lack of clinical significance of DR11 expression in APL patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation .

600 Immune Recognition of the pmI/RAR-a Protein tional Bone Marrow Transplant Registry , an analysis was conducted in 189 APL patients in first remission who underwent an allogeneic related bone marrow transplant .
The patients were grouped into HLA-DR11* ( n = 44 ) and HLA-DR11I~ ( n = 145 ) .
No significant difference in survival or disease-free survival was evident between the two groups .
Also , the proportion of DR11 patients ( 23 % ) does not differ significantly from that seen in the general population . ''
In case the pmIl/RAR- « junction could not be presented by the HLA class I molecule , then the only chance that this fusion protein can be recognized in APL cells by T lymphocytes resides in the restoration of DR expression through pharmacological ( 21 ) or genetic manipulation , or in the targeting of the still hypothetical DR * APL stem cells .
Our studies demonstrate that the BCR1/25 peptide corresponding to the fusion region of the pmI/RAR-a « protein present in APL cells can be specifically recognized by donor ( but not by patient ) CD4 T cells in a HLA class II ( DR11 ) -restricted fash-ion ; CD8/HLA class I-restricted T cells were not generated , possibly due to the lack of HLA-binding motifs in the pml/ RAR-a fusion region .
Finally , APL blasts were not lysed by anti-pmI/RAR- « cytotoxic T cell clones due to the lack of expression of the DR11 molecule by the APL blasts studied .
Further immunotherapeutic approaches to APL will need to overcome the two main problems encountered in this study : the lack of DR expression in APL cells ( 20 ) and the poor immune status of APL patients .
