However , the action of dopamine on HIV-1 gene expression in cells of the immune system has not yet been examined .
Here , we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 expression by dopamine in Jurkat T cells and in primary blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
HIV-1 replication was increased by dopamine , which correlated with the increased levels of HIV-1 transactivation .
Our transient expression data revealed that dopamine stimulated transcription through the NF-xB element present in the long terminal repeat .
The importance of NF-xB sites was confirmed by using vectors containing wild-type or mutant xB sites in a heterologous promoter .
Consistent with the role of NF-xB in mediating dopamine responsiveness , the proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished dopamine-induced transcriptional activation .
We further explored the effect of dopamine in the presence of phorbol esters or tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF-q ) known to activate NF-xB .
The combination of dopamine and TNF-a led to a stimulation of HIV-1 transcription and replication .
However , in contrast with TNF-a , dopamine treatment did not affect NF-xB DNA binding activity nor the concentrations of p50 , p65 and IkB-a proteins , which suggests a distinct NF-xB activation mechanism .
These results reveal a new link between the dopamine system , cytokine signaling pathway and regulation of gene expression via the involvement of NF-xB in T cells and PBMC .
INTRODUCTION Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms which govern expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) genome is essential to understand the persistent viral replication and viral latency underlying HIV-l-associated pathogenesis .
HIV-1 transcription is directed by the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) through interactions with a number of viral and host cell proteins , such as the transcription factors Spl and NF-KB ( reviewed in 1,2 ) .
Viral production can be induced in response to a variety of agents which mediate their action through different transcription factors .
Interleukin 6 affects viral expression through the transcription factor NF-IL6 ( 3 ) .
A number of stimuli , such as tumor necrosis factor- ( TNF- ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) ( 4 ) , reactive oxygen intermediates ( 5 ) , phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis ( 6 ) , transforming growth factor- } ( TGF-B ) ( 7 ) and amino acid analogs ( 8 ) stimulate HIV-1 transcription by activation of the NF-KB transcription factor family ( 9-11 ) .
Upon stimulation-induced nuclear translocation , NF-KB proteins activate HIV-1 gene transcription through binding to the xB enhancer motif located in the -109/-79 LTR region .
We have reported recently that the neuromodulator dopamine is involved in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression in neuronal cells , via the transcription factor COUP-TF , acting on the proximal -68/+80 LTR region ( 12 ) .
The dopamine system is involved in the control of motor , cognitive and neuroendocrine processes in the central nervous system .
Dopamine mediates its effects by activating second messengers through its interaction with G-protein-coupled dopamine receptors .
The action of dopamine on target cells affects multiple intracellular pathways , such as formation of cyclic AMP , inositolphosphates and arachidonic acid , and modulates cellular electrical activity by altering the properties of ion channels ( 13-15 ) .
Pathways to the nucleus may involve adenyl cyclase and protein kinase A ( PKA ) or Ca # + , protein kinase C ( PKC ) or tyrosine kinase proteins , which regulate the activity of a number of transcription factors , such as CREB , AP-1 and COUP-TF through transcriptional and post-transcriptional events .
In addition to cell surface receptor binding , dopamine is also transported in cells via specific uptake mechanisms ( reviewed in 16 ) .
Recent studies have established that lymphocytes are also able to actively produce and transport catecholamines , such as dopamine ( 17,18 ) .
Dopamine is able to modulate peripheral blood lymphocyte activity via dopamine D3 and D5 receptors ( 19,20 ) .
However , effects of dopamine on HIV-1 expression in cells of the immune system have not been examined .
In this study , we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 expression by the neuromodulator dopamine in T lymphocytes and in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells *To whom correspondence should be addressed .

16 ( PBMC ) .
Our findings reveal that dopamine is able to stimulate viral replication in Jurkat T cells and in PBMC .
This correlates with increased transcription from the HIV-1 LTR through the NF-KB element .
Moreover , we have examined the effect of dopamine in the presence of phorbol esters and TNF- .
Finally , our results indicate that the mechanism of dopamine-mediated stimulation is distinct from the classic NF-KB activation mechanism involving signal-induced NF-KB nuclear translocation , and presents similarities with the recently reported TGF-fB-mediated HIV-1 activation ( 7 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Cell culture media and all reagents , unless specified , were obtained from Sigma .
[ `` CJchloramphenicol was obtained from NEN Life Science .
Plasmid constructs The LTR ( LAI ) -CAT and LTR ( HXB2 ) Luc vectors were described previously ( 12,21 ) .
LTR ( HXB2 ) AGC-CAT , LTR ( HX-B2 ) AxB-CAT , LTR ( HXB2 ) ArB/GC-CAT were described previously ( 22 ) .
The vector was constructed by isolating the Earl-HindlIII LTR insert from LTR ( HXB2 ) AxB/GC-CAT and subcloning the blunt-ended fragment into the Smal site of pUC19-CATO .
The GC-WAP-CAT , GCmut-WAP-CAT , < B-WAP-CAT , xBmut-WAP-CAT vectors contain respectively the wild-type and mutant ( -79/-45 ) GC-rich or ( -104/-79 ) NF-KB region from HIV-1 LTR ( 23 ) .
Cell culture , isolation and propagation of PBMC Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 10 mM HEPES and penicillin/strepto-mycin ( 100 U/ml ) .
Human PBMC were separated from whole blood collected from HIV seronegative donors by Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) density gradient centrifugation , washed thoroughly to remove contaminating platelets and cryopreserved .
Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U of penicillin/ml and 100 ug of streptomycin/ml .
Cells were activated with 2 ug/ml phytohemaglutinin and 20 U/ml interleukin-2 for 2-3 days before HIV infection .
Transfections , CAT and luciferase assays Cells ( 5 x 10° ) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with 1 pmol of reporter plasmid and 0.5 pmol of expression vector .
When indicated , cells were treated 1 day after transfection with dopamine ( 100 uM ) , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA , 10 ng/ml ) , TNF- ( 10 ng/ml ; Genzyme ) , MG132 ( 10 uM ) or cyclosporine A ( 0.5-5 ug/ml ; Sandoz ) and incubated for another 24 h before harvesting .
Each transfection was repeated at least four times with different plasmid preparations .
Chloram-phenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays were performed as described previously ( 12 ) .

Infection and p24 ELISA assay Jurkat cells ( 10 '' ) or PBMC ( 5 x 10° ) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with 5 ug of the proviral genome pNL4-3 .
After 2 h , dopamine ( 100 uM ) , PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) or TNF- ( 10 ng/ml ; Genzyme ) was added .
Cell culture super-natants were harvested every 24 h , free virus was removed by centrifugation .
Virus replication in culture was measured by the production of p24 protein by p24 viral capsid antigen ELISA ( Dupont ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) EMSAs were performed with 10 ug of nuclear protein extracts in a buffer containing 1 ng of *P 5'-end-labeled KB probe , 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , 50 ng of sonicated salmon sperm DNA , 10 mM MgC ] , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 12.5 mM HEPES , pH 7.8 , 10 % glycerol , 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 .
Mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 4°C and protein-bound DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6 % polyacryl-amide gel in 0.25x TBE ( 1x TBE = 89 mM Tris , 89 mM boric acid , 2 mM EDTA ) .
For competition assays , unlabeled KB oligonucleotide was added at a 50-fold molar excess at the same time as the probe .
For supershift assays , antibodies directed against NF-KBp50 ( sc-1190 ) specific for p50 and p105 , or c-Rel ( sc-272 ) reactive with both c-Rel p75 and NF-KBp65 , or NF-AT ( se-1149 ) reactive with NF-AT C1 , C2 , C3 and C4 , or Ets1/Ets2 ( sc-112 ) reactive with both Ets 1 and Ets2 ( Santa Cruz Biotech-nology ) , or normal rabbit serum were mixed with nuclear proteins for 1 h at 4°C prior addition of the probe .
The sequence of the xB synthetic oligonucleotides corresponds to the -108/-77 sequence of the HIV-1 ( LAI ) LTR .
Western blot analysis Jurkat cells ( 10 '' ) were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
Following a 10 min incubation at 4°C in buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 1.5 mM MgCl , 10 mM KCI ] , 0.5 mM EDTA , complemented with protease inhibitors ) , nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation .
Cytoplasmic extracts were collected and stored at -80°C .

and stored at -80°C .
For western analysis , proteins ( 10 ug ) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper .
Membranes were preincubated with 3 % bovine serum albumin in PBS overnight at 4°C and were probed with polyclonal antibodies described above in EMSA ( 1:5000 dilution ) for 90 min at room temperature in PBS-0.1 % Tween 20 ( PBST ) .
After six washes with PBST for 5 min , membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody ( 1:7500 dilution ) for 40 min and washed six times for 5 min in PBST .
The signal was visualized by the chemiluminescence protocol ( ECL , Amersham ) .
RESULTS Dopamine stimulates HIV-1 transcription and replication in Jurkat T cells and in PBMC To investigate the effect of dopamine on HIV-1 gene transcrip-tion , the LTR-CAT reporter vector containing the full-length LTR of the HIV-1 LAI strain was transfected into Jurkat cells which were either left untreated or treated for 24 h with Fold induction to T dopamine ( uM ) Figure 1 .

Analysis of CAT activity 48 h after transfection demonstrates that dopamine is able to stimulate HIV-1 gene transcription in Jurkat cells , in a dose-dependent manner , up to 3- and 4-fold with 100 and 300 LM dopamine , respectively ( Fig .
1 ) .
To study the effect of dopamine on viral replication in the Jurkat T cell line and in PBMC , cells were transfected with the proviral clone pNL 4-3 .
One day post-transfection , cells were treated with 100 LM dopamine or left untreated .

16 3293 culture supernatant was monitored every 24 h over a 4-day period ( Fig .

Results show that in Jurkat cells , dopamine treatment led to a 3-fold enhancement of p24 antigen levels , at each time point , which correlates with the 3-fold increased levels of HIV-1 transactivation .
Interestingly , a 3-fold enhancement of p24 levels was also detected in PBMC , at time points posterior to 48 h ( Fig .

The NF-KB element is involved in dopamine-induced gene transcription from the HIV-1 LTR We have previously shown that in neuronal cells HIV-1 gene transcription is stimulated in the presence of the transcription factor COUP-TF and dopamine through the -68/+29 proximal region of the LTR ( 12 ) .
To delineate the LTR sequences responsible for dopamine-induced activation in T cells , we transfected LTR-CAT vectors containing 5° deletions of the LTR region and tested for their induction following dopamine treatment ( Fig .
3 ) .
The dopamine-induced activation was not affected by deletion of sequences upstream of position -283 ( construct 2 ) ; deletion of the NF-KB binding sites up to position -89 ( construct 3 ) dramatically reduced the uninduced expression and reduced dopamine-induced transcription by half : from 3.1 to 1.5 .
Further removal of the 3 ' half of the last NF-KB site and one Sp1 site up to position -68 ( construct 4 ) or all three Sp1 sites up to position -40 ( construct 5 ) completely abolished dopamine-induced transcription .
These results indicate that sequences responsible for dopamine induction of LTR-driven transcription are contained within nucleotides -283 to -68 .
To precisely identify the proximal promoter elements involved in dopamine responsiveness , we used LTR-CAT reporter vectors containing internal deletions .
Deletion of the NF-KB and Spl sites within the -283/+80 LTR-CAT ( construct 6 ) resulted in a complete lack of dopamine induction , confirming the importance of these sites in dopamine responsiveness .

Numbers in brackets indicate the fold stimulation induced by dopamine .
or the three Spl sites ( construct 8 ) decreased the induction .
Taken together , these results indicate the essential role of the NF-KB and the Spl elements in dopamine-mediated transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR .
NF-KB sites are sufficient for dopamine-induced gene transcription To precisely examine the individual role of NF-KB and Spl sites in dopamine responsiveness , we used constructs containing each of these sites in a heterologous background .
In GC-WAP-CAT and NF- « B-WAP-CAT , the -79/-45 Spl sequences or the -104/-79 sequence containing the two NF-KB sites of the HIV-1 LTR , respectively , are inserted in front of the whey acidic protein ( WAP ) promoter containing a CAAT box and a TATA box ( 23 ) .
As shown in Figure 4 , transcription directed by the Spl-containing WAP promoter was not significantly responsive to dopamine .
In contrast , with NF- « B-WAP-CAT , dopamine treatment led to a 2.7-fold stimulation , comparable to the 3.1-fold induction observed with HIV-1 LTR .
As a control , the xBmut-WAP-CAT vector , which contains mutations in both NF-KB binding sites ( 23 ) , was unable to cause any dopamine responsiveness .
These results demonstrate that NF-KB sites are sufficient to mediate dopamine-induced gene transcription in Jurkat cells .
Since the NF-KB element is known to mediate phorbol ester signaling , we measured as a control the induction of transcriptional activity caused by PMA treatment for 24 h. Results show that the wild-type ©B-WAP promoter was stimulated 68-fold , while , as expected , the mutant promoter was not significantly Relative CAT Activity 0 1° 2 3 60 70 Figure 4 .
NF-KB sites are sufficient for dopamine-induced gene expression .
The GC-WAP-CAT , KB-WAP-CAT and xBmut-WAP-CAT vectors contain the -79/-45 three Sp1 sites , the -104/-79 wild-type and mutant NF-xB sequence from the HIV-1 LTR , respectively , inserted upstream of the promoter of the WAP and the CAT gene ( 36 ) .
Jurkat cells were transfected with each of these vectors and were subsequently left untreated or treated for 24 h with either dopamine ( 100 uM ) or PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) .

affected .
Interestingly , the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 LTR was stimulated 7.2-fold in the presence of PMA , which is about double of the 3.1-fold dopamine-induced stimulation ( Fig .
5 ) .
An inhibitor of proteasome is able to abolish dopamine-induced HIV-1 gene transcription Activation of NF-KB is induced by pathways which are controlled by the 268 proteasome complex .
The cytoplasmic NF-KB factor , complexed to the IKB inhibitor , is translocated in the nucleus following degradation of IKB by the proteasome ; in addition , active NF-KB dimers are generated following processing of p105 or p100 into p50 and p52 proteins by the proteasome pathway ( 24,25 ) .
It is known that the inhibitor of proteasome MG132 prevents nuclear translocation of NF-KB and thus inhibits NF-KB-mediated LTR-driven transcription ( 9,26,27 ) .
To further confirm the importance of NF-KB in dopamine responsiveness , we tested whether the action of dopamine was repressed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor .
Jurkat cells were transfected with either HIV-1 LTR-CAT or xB-WAP-CAT and subsequently treated with 10 uM of MG132 in the absence or presence of dopamine .
Results indicate that treatment with MG132 alone did not significantly affect LTR-driven transcription ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 and 2 ) and decreased xB-WAP-driven transcription by half ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
As a positive control , the PMA-induced LTR-driven stimulation could be totally abolished in the presence of 10 uM of MG132 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Interestingly , in the presence of dopamine , MG132 treatment totally suppressed dopamine-induced transcriptional activation of both LTR-CAT ( lanes 5 and 6 ) and ( lanes 9 and 10 ) .
We controlled by EMSA using nuclear extracts of cells treated by PMA or dopamine that the formation of the NF-KB complexes was abolished in the presence of MG132 ( results not shown ) .
These results clearly show that , similar to the PMA-induced activity , dopamine-induced transcriptional activity can be blocked by a proteasome inhibitor , which strongly suggests that the action of dopamine on the HIV-LTR or on a heterologous promoter containing KB sites requires the presence of NF-KB proteins .
Effect of dopamine , PMA and TNF-a on HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in Jurkat cells and in PBMC Besides PMA , various cytokines are known to activate HIV-1 gene transcription via NF-KB ( 25 ) .
TNF- was previously shown to stimulate LTR-driven CAT activity in Jurkat cells ( 4 ) .
To examine the effect on HIV-1 gene transcription of the combined action of two distinct activators of NF-KB , Jurkat cells and PBMC were transfected with LTR-CAT and LTR-Luc , respectively , and subsequently treated with either dopamine , PMA , TNF- or the combination of two signaling molecules ( Fig .
6A ) .
In Jurkat cells , the combination of PMA and dopamine , leading each to a 3.1- and 7.2-fold activation , resulted in an 11.5-fold stimulation , which corresponds to an additive effect .
The most dramatic effect was obtained with the combined action of dopamine and TNF- .
While dopamine and TNF- alone led to a 3.1- and 4.0-fold increase , respectively , the combination of dopamine and TNF- resulted in a 15-fold synergistic transcriptional stimulation ( Fig .
6A , left panel ) .
In PBMC , the combination of TNF and dopamine , either in the absence or presence of PMA , led to a 5.8-fold transcriptional increase , which corresponds to an additive effect ( Fig .
6A , right panel ) .
We also examined the effect of the combination of these stimuli on the proliferation of HIV-1 in PBMC .

In Figure 6B are shown the results obtained 5 days after infection .
Interestingly , the combination of dopamine and PMA ( lane 4 ) , as well as dopamine and TNF , in the absence ( lane 6 ) or presence of PMA ( lane 8 ) led to an additive increase in viral replication after 5 days .
Since the PBMC were preactivated with PHA , it is not surprising that PMA treatment failed to further increase HIV-1 replication , as previously described ( 28 ) .
To examine whether dopamine responsiveness was mediated through a calcium-dependent and , more specifically , a calcineurin-dependent pathway , Jurkat cells were transfected with LTR-CAT and treated for 24 h with dopamine in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of cyclosporine A ( 0.5-8 ug/ml1 ) .
Cyclosporine A was unable to affect the dopamine-induced transcriptional stimulation , indicating that in Jurkat cells , dopamine does not enhance the activity of calcineurin ( results not shown ) .
Dopamine does not change NF-KB DNA binding activities and NF-KB levels To examine whether dopamine treatment was able to induce xB binding activity , we performed EMSA experiments with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells treated for various lengths of time with either dopamine or PMA as a control ( Fig .
7A ) .
It was reported that with Jurkat nuclear extracts , EMSA analysis displays a complex pattern of binding activity , which can be affected by the salt concentration in the binding reaction and the conditions of cell culture ( 29 ) .
Our results show that PMA treatment caused a large increase of two DNA-protein complexes known to be formed by NF-KB proteins ( lanes 1-5 ) .

Only the time point after 5 days is shown .
reported previously , NF-KB activity comprises a family of DNA-binding proteins which , in PMA-stimulated Jurkat cells , give rise to two discrete DNA-protein complexes ( 30 ) .
In contrast with PMA , dopamine treatment did not significantly affect the minor complex C ( lanes 6-10 ) , of electrophoretic mobility similar to the faster migrating NF-KB complex .
The formation of complex C was specific , since it was competed by a 50-fold excess of the unlabeled KB oligonucleotide ( Fig .
7B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The xB sequence is the binding site of distinct transcription factors , including members of the NF-KB/Re ! l family and the zinc finger proteins MBP1/PRII-BP1/HIV-EP1 and MBP-2 ( 31 ) .
To examine whether complex C was formed by proteins of the NF-KB family , we performed supershift experiments with nuclear proteins from cells treated with dopamine for 4 h , in the presence of polyclonal antibodies directed against either NF-KBp50 , or p65 and c-Rel , or both proteins ( Fig .
7B ) .
The presence of the p50 subunit in complex C was demonstrated , since addition of anti-p50 antibodies ( lanes 4 and 6 ) , but not a non-immune serum ( lane 3 ) or anti-p65 antibodies ( lane 5 ) abolished complex C formation and led to the up-shifting of the activity ( lanes 4 and 6 ) .
Since interactions between Ets and NF-KB/NF-AT proteins have been reported to regulate the HIV-1 enhancer activity in human T cells ( 32,33 ) , we performed supershift experiments with antibodies directed against NF-AT ( C1-C4 ) and Ets1/Ets2 .
Both antibodies were unable to affect complex C formation ( results not shown ) , confirming that complex C contains only NF-KBp5Q0 , and no Ets or NF-AT proteins .
Since known to act through NF-KB , led alone and in combination with dopamine to a 4.0- and 15-fold transcriptional stimulation , respectively , we examined the EMSA pattern obtained with extracts of cells treated with either dopamine , TNF or the combination of both signals ( Fig .
7C ) .
As expected , stimulation with TNF-q led to the formation of a major NF-KB complex ( lane 3 ) .
Surprisingly , the formation of this complex was not further increased upon stimulation with dopamine and TNF ( lane 4 ) .
This result confirms that dopamine does not induce NF-KB DNA binding activities in Jurkat cells .
To further confirm the absence of NF-KB translocation induced by dopamine , we measured the levels of p50 , p65 and Nucleic Acids Research , 1999 , Vol .

proteins in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of Jurkat cells treated with dopamine over a 2 h period ( Fig .

Western blot analysis revealed that p50 , p65 and IKB- & proteins were located mostly in the cytoplasmic fraction , with a low amount in the nuclear fraction .
Interestingly , protein levels were unchanged in each fraction upon dopamine treatment , over a 2 h period .
This result is consistent with and confirms the previous observations , showing unchanged DNA binding activity of NF-KB ( Fig .
7 ) .
DISCUSSION Here our studies reveal that the neuromodulator dopamine can contribute , by itself or in the presence of cytokines or other NF-KB activating agents , to increase HIV-1 gene expression in cells of the immune system .
In the endocrine system , dopamine is synthesized by chromaffin cells present in the adrenal glands , and is secreted into blood vessels following various stimuli , especially stress conditions ( 34 ) .
Recently , cells of the immune system , T lymphocytes , were also discovered to synthesize , transport and bind catecholamines , such as dopamine ( 17-20 ) .
It was therefore intriguing to test whether this neuromodulator , whose endocrine-mediated secretion in the immune sytem is stress dependent , affects HIV-1 gene expression .
Our experiments reveal that dopamine is able to stimulate viral replication in the Jurkat T cell line as well as in PBMC , which correlates with increased transactivation from the HIV-1 LTR .
Moreover , we show that dopamine , in the presence of the nuclei cytoplasm duration of treatment o 30 60 90 0 30 60 so __ mms -S treo to < % 6 l aug “ ( pi { min ) 0 30 §0 120 0 30 60 120 fug -a p30 = mn mn mgs -- o_ ( min ) 0 30 60 120 Figure 8 .
Dopamine does not change NF-KB levels in Jurkat cells .
Western blot analyses were performed with specific antibodies against p50 , p65 and IxB-0 , as indicated .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from Jurkat cells treated with dopamine for various times , ranging from O to 120 min , as indicated .
Specific bands for p50 , p65 and IKB- @ are indicated by arrows .
cytokine TNF-Q , leads to a synergistic 15-fold transcriptional stimulation of the HIV-1 genome in T cells and to an additive effect in PBMC .
TNF- is known as a potent inducer of HIV-1 transcription and replication ( 4,35 ) .
Elevated levels of various cytokines , including TNF-Q , IL-1 , IL-6 and TGF-f } , are detected in the sera of late stage disease of HIV-1-infected patients .
These cytokines stimulate viral replication and contribute to 3298 Nucleic Acids Research , 1999 , Vol .

16 HIV-1 pathogenesis ( reviewed in 26 ) .
Our data reveal that the combination of dopamine and TNF- is a potent mediator of increased HIV-1 gene expression .
We further demonstrate that dopamine responsiveness is mediated through the NF-KB sites of the HIV-1 LTR .
A minimal xB-WAP promoter containing two KB sites , but not a mutated xBmut-WAP region , was also sufficient for dopamine-mediated stimulation .
Thus , dopamine represents a new member on the list of stimuli which are ©B-mediated transcriptional activators ( 25 ) .
The NF-KB/Rel family contains five DNA-binding members , p50 , p52 , p65/ReIA , c-Rel and RelB ( 11 ) .
Our supershift results indicate that p50 proteins are present in nuclear extracts at a low constitutive level , and bind to the KB DNA site .
Surprisingly , in contrast with PMA and TNF-a , dopamine treatment did not change NF-KB binding activity .
These data establish that dopamine-induced LTR-driven transcription through the NF-KB sites does not require modification of the NF-KB DNA binding activity .
These observations correlate with our western blot results , which show that in our culture conditions , Jurkat cells contain a small nuclear fraction of p50 and p65 NF-KB proteins , which are unaffected by dopamine treatment .
It is well established that NF-KB is retained in the cytoplasm , through its association with the IKB family of proteins .
Cytosolic IKB- & has a half-life of 1-2 h , and is rapidly degraded upon stimulation by activating agents such as phorbol esters , IL-1 and TNF- ( 26,36 ) .
We show that IxB-a levels are unaffected by dopamine - stimulation , confirming that dopamine does not induce NF-KB nuclear translocation .
Taken together our findings reveal a mechanism for HIV-1 gene activation by NF-KB , through unchanged DNA binding activities .
Similar results were recently reported in the activation of HIV-1 gene expression upon TGF-f } treatment ; HaCaT cells contain a constitutive fraction of NF-KB proteins in the nuclei , unaffected by TGF-fB stimulation ( 7 ) .
The importance of the proteasome pathway for NF-KB activation has been well established .
NF-KB molecules sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor IKB are translocated within the nuclei following degradation by the proteasome .
In addition , formation of p50 is generated by processing of the N-terminal portion of p105 by a proteasome-mediated process ( 11,24,37 ) .
We show here that a proteasome inhibitor which completely clears the nuclei from all NF-KB molecules , totally abolished dopamine-induced stimulation .
This repression of dopamine responsiveness by a proteasome inhibitor suggests that the fraction of NF-KB proteins present in the nuclei is both sufficient and essential to mediate dopamine action .
It therefore appears that dopamine , to play its role as a transcriptional activator , requires the action of another stimulus which first induces nuclear translocation of NF-KB .
Indeed , in HIV-1 infected T cells , autocrine secretion of TNF- @ was shown to control HIV-1 replication because of its ability to maintain elevated NF-KB in the nucleus ( 38 ) .
A constitutive NF-KB activity was also described in neurons ( 39 ) .
Our previous results have shown that in neuronal SK-N-MC cells , dopamine treatment alone is unable to affect HIV-1 transcription .
In these cells , dopamine stimulates transcription in the presence of increased levels of the nuclear receptor COUP-TF via the proximal -68/+80 LTR region ( 12 ) .
Similarly , our preliminary data indicate that in Jurkat cells , dopamine responsiveness can be mediated by overexpressed COUP-TF and/or CREB proteins via the proximal -68/+80 LTR region .
These data reveal a variety of molecular mechanisms by which dopamine modulates HIV-1 gene transcription .
Here our data in cells of the immune system stress the fact that dopamine alone is able to activate HIV-1 gene transcription through NF-KB .
The classic NF-KB activation mechanism , triggered by a number of extracellular inducers such as phorbol esters , TNF-a and oxygen peroxide , involves activation of a protein kinase that phosphorylates IxB and p105 , followed by degradation of IxB , and nuclear translocation of NF-KB ( 40,41 ) .
Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a second signaling pathway , distinct from the IKBa degradation and NF-KB nuclear translocation mechanism .
Overexpression of p21 ( CIP1/WAF1 ) in Jurkat cells stimulated HIV-1 gene transcription without inducing changes in NF-KB DNA binding activity ( 42 ) .
TGF-B was found to activate NF-KB proteins present constitutively in the nuclei of HaCaT cells , through a yet unidentified pathway ( 7 ) .
Similarly , a second signaling pathway triggered by IL-1 and TNF-o which confers NF-KB transcriptional competency was identified in A549 epithelial cells ( 43 ) .
Here our data also reveal the existence of a dopamine-induced pathway distinct from the classic NF-KB activation mechanism .
Recently , the transcriptional activity of NF-KB was found to be stimulated through phosphorylation of p65 by PKA ( 44 ) .
Moreover , phosphorylation of p50 was demonstrated to be a key step in the regulation of NF-KB in adenovirus transformed cells ( 45 ) .
Such a scenario involving increased phosphorylation of p50 induced by dopamine signaling may explain NF-KB activation by dopamine , as well as the synergistic effect with TNF- .
Our data further reveal that the dopamine-mediated effect does not require signaling through the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin , which activates nuclear import of NF-AT transcription factors ( 46,47 ) .
Clearly , further studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying NF-KB activation by dopamine , as well as the dopamine signaling pathway in T cells .
It will also be interesting to examine whether the action of dopamine is mediated by cellular uptake or by binding to the cell surface dopamine receptors .
