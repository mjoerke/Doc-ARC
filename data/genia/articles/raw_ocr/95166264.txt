Previously , an inducible enhancer between nucleotides -299 and -228 that contains NF-KB and CArG motifs was identified .
We now report the characterization of a second essential positive regulatory element located between nucleotides -137 and -64 that binds Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) .
This element had maximal activity in lymphoid cells , paralleling the cell type specificity of Elf-1 expression .
Transcription from the IL-2Ra « promoter was inhibited when either the Elf-1 or the HMG-I ( Y ) binding site was mutated .
Coexpression of both proteins activated transcription of the -137 to -64 element in COS-7 cells .
Elf-1 physically associated with HMG-I and with p50 and c-Rel in vitro , suggesting that protein-protein interactions might functionally coordinate the actions of the upstream and downstream positive regulatory elements .
This is the first report of a physical interaction between an Ets family member and NF-KB family proteins .
These findings provide significant new insights into the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that regulate cell-type-specific and inducible IL-2Ra « gene expression and also have implications for other genes regulated by Elf-1 and family proteins .
The interaction of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-2 receptors ( IL-ZR ) critically regulates the magnitude and duration of the T-cell immune response ( 42 , 70 ) .
Resting T cells and large granular lymphocytes express intermediate-affinity IL-2R , which consist of the IL-2R B ( 25 64 , 76 ) and y ( 68 ) chains .
y is encoded by the gene that is defective in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( 56 ) and is now referred to as the common y chain ( y , ) , on the basis of its also being shared by the IL-4 , IL-7 , and IL-15 receptors ( 21 , 32 , 33 , 55 , 62 ) .
With cellular activation , the IL-2R « -chain ( IL-2Ra ) gene is induced ( 39 , 54 ) , converting intermediate-affinity receptors to high-affinity ones ( 42 70 ) .
Thus , whereas IL-ZRB and y , , are essential molecules whose dimerization is required for IL-2 signaling ( 52 , 53 ) , IL-Z2Ra expression is an essential determinant of the acquisition by a cell of full responsiveness to IL-2 .
Conse-quently , IL-2Ra « transcription is tightly regulated ( reviewed reference 38 ) .
Transcription of the IL-2Ra « gene is potently induced within 1 h following mitogenic stimulation of normal peripheral blood T cells ( 41 ) .
The gene is also rapidly induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) in Jurkat T cells , which have been extensively used to delineate regulatory regions of the human IL-2Ra promoter ( 2 , 3 , 7 , 43 , 75 ) .

1786 onstrated that inducible IL-2Ra expression is at least partially regulated by a potent enhancer located between nucleotide positions -299 and -228 relative to the major transcription start site ( 44 ) , herein termed positive regulatory region I ( PRRI ) ( Fig .
1A ) .
This enhancer contains NF-kB and CArG motifs , binding sites which play important roles in activation of the IL-2Ra « gene in response to the transactivator protein ( Tax ) of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , PMA , and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( 2 , 3 , 8 , 43 , 46 , 75 ) .
The sequence of this enhancer , however , is not well conserved in the murine IL-2Ra « gene ( 67 ) , and furthermore , internal deletions within the IL-2Ra « promoter suggested the presence of other positive regulatory elements more proximal to the promoter ( unpublished observations ) .
We now report the characterization of a transcriptional regulatory element located between nucleotides -137 and -64 ( PRRII ) ( Fig .
1A ) .
This element contains binding sites for at least two DNA-binding proteins : an Ets family protein , Elf-1 ( 72 ) , and the nonhistone chromatin-associated proteins , HMG-I ( Y ) ( 14 , 30 , 48 ) .
Deletion or mutation of the binding sites for these proteins profoundly reduced IL-2Ra « gene tran-scription , even in the presence of an intact upstream enhancer ( PRRI ) , and overexpression of Elf-1 and HMG-I together in COS-7 cells activated transcription from PRRII .
Elf-1 specifically bound to NF-kB1 ( p50 ) and c-Rel in vitro , suggesting that these protein-protein interactions may mediate the transcriptional coordination between PRRI and downstream PRRII .
The characterization of PRRII has , therefore , significantly enhanced our understanding of the molecular regulation of the IL-Z2Ra gene and opens up new avenues for understand Vou .

All of the Elf-1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR and cloned between the BamHI and Xbel sites of peDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) .
The NF- « B p50 construct corresponded to the 1,680-bp HindII-Xbel fragment ( encoding amino acids 1 to 502 ) of the KBF1 cDNA ( 31 ) .
The c-Rel , RelA ( p65 ) , and serum response factor ( SRF ) cDNAs have been reported previously ( 4 , 57 , 61 ) .

Cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran ( 65 ) .
Transfections of IL-2Ra « enhancer or promoter constructs were performed with 5 or 10 pg of DNA , respectively .
Cotransfection experiments with COS-7 cells were performed with Lipofectamine ( Gibco-BRL ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions by using 5 mg of reporter and 3 ug of each expression plasmid .
The total DNA in the cotransfection experiments was kept constant with pUC13 DNA .
Following transfection , cells were maintained in medium for 24 to 30 h and then were treated with 0 or 20 ng of PMA per ml for 12 to 14 h. Cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.25 M Tris-HCI , pH 7.5 .
Extracts were clarified at 65°C for 10 min and assayed for protein concentrations with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit .

The optimal enzyme concentration and digestion time for cach preparation were determined empir-ically .
DNA was fractionated on a 9 % sequencing gel ( acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio , 37.5:1 ) with a buffer containing 90 mM Tris , 90 mM borate , and 2 mM EDTA ( pH 8.3 ) ( 1x TBE ) .
GST retention and c-Rel and HMG-I association assays .
The GST-Elf-1-Tag plasmid was constructed by inserting the myc-tag epitope ( 15 ) between amino acids 5 and 6 of the Elf-1 sequence by PCR mutagenesis ( 51 ) , and this Elf-myc-tag cDNA was cloned between the SmelI and Xhol sites of pGEX 2Tplink ( created by inserting the polylinker 5'-GATCCCGGGGCGGCCGCTCGA GG-3 ' between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX 2T [ Pharmacia-LKB ] ) .
The recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing .

15 , 1995 RESULTS Identification of a new positive regulatory element in the IL-2Ra « gene .
To investigate the existence of important elements downstream of PRRI , we cloned a series of IL-2Ra fragments ( Fig .
2A ) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in pBLCAT2 ( 47 ) and assayed their abilities to promote transcription in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
These studies revealed that the -137 to -64 construct ( pTKa-137/-64 ) exhibited significantly higher levels of transcription in unstimulated and PMA-stimulated Jurkat cells than did the control plasmid , pBLCAT2 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Truncation of the -137 to -64 region diminished transcriptional activity , and therefore we assigned -137 and -64 as the boundaries of this novel IL-2Ra « positive regulatory region ( PRRII ) ( Fig .
1A ) , the sequence of which is shown in Fig .
1B .
Since IL-2Ra expression is restricted principally to lymphoid cells , it was noteworthy that pTKa-137/-64 was not transcriptionally active in two nonlymphoid cell lines , GM637 and COS-7 ( Fig .
2C ) ; thus , its expression appeared to exhibit cell type specific-ity .
Identification of nuclear factors that bind to PRRII .
Factors binding to PRRII were identified by EMSAs with nuclear extracts from unstimulated and PMA-stimulated normal and Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
3A ) .
When poly ( dI-dC ) was used as the nonspecific competitor , only complex A was observed ( lanes 1 to 5 ) , whereas in the presence of sonicated salmon sperm DNA ( lanes 6 to 12 ) or poly ( dG-dC ) ( data not shown ) , the faster-mobility complex B was also detected .
Complex A was constitutively expressed in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3A , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
In contrast , it was only weakly detected in resting normal T cells but increased following mitogenic stimulation and then declined by 24 h ( Fig .
3A ) .
Complex B was also constitutively present in Jurkat cells ( lanes 11 and 12 ) .
In normal T cells , it was modestly induced and continued to increase for at least 24 h ( lanes 6 to 10 ) .
Both complexes were specific , as demonstrated by the ability of unlabeled -137/-64 , but not API or CREB , oligonucleotides to inhibit their formation ( Fig .
3B , lanes 4 and 5 versus 3 ) .
The additional band at the 9-h time point in T-cell nuclear extracts ( Fig .
3A , lane 9 ) was variably detected , and its identity is unknown .
Complexes A and B were also induced in normal T cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin , and analogously to the situation for Jurkat , they were constitutively expressed in three other lymphoid cell lines tested ( MT-2 and Kit-225 T cells and YT-1 natural killer-like cells ) ( data not shown ) .
Complex A contains Elf-1 .
To identify the nucleotides contacted in complex A , we performed methylation ( Fig .
4A ) and ethylation ( Fig .
4B ) interference assays .
Methylation of the bottom strand G residues at positions -91 and -92 ( Fig .
4A , lane 4 ) strongly diminished binding activity ( Fig .
4A , lane 4 ) .
The ethylation interference assays confirmed these results and additionally showed strong protection of nucleotides -88 , -90 , -93 , -94 , -95 and weaker protection of nucleotides -85 and -86 on the bottom strand ( Fig .
4B , lane 4 ) and -87 and -89 on the top strand ( lane 2 ) .
The protected nucleotides ( Fig .
4C ) span a GGAA purine-rich motif ( -91 to -94 ) , suggesting that complex A contained an Ets family protein .
Members of this family have been shown to regulate a number of lymphoid-tissue-specific genes ( 22 , 28 , 78 ; for a review , see references 6 , 49 , and 63 ) .
In order to identify the Ets family protein contained in complex A , we performed antibody supershift and oligonucleotide competition analyses .
Antibodies to Ets-1 and Ets-2 did not block or supershift complex A ( Fig .
5A , lanes 3 and 4 ) .

Methylation and ethylation interference analyses of complex A. Double-stranded -137 to -64 probes labeled on the top ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or bottom ( lanes 3 and 4 ) strand were partially methylated ( A ) with dimethyl ] sulfate ( DMS ) or ethylated with diethylpyrocarbamate ( DEPC ) ( B ) and Jurkat nuclear extracts bound .
Free ( F ) and bound ( B ) probes from complex A were excised from the gel , treated with piperidine , lyophilized , resolved on 9 % denaturing gels , and autoradiographed .
( C ) Summary of the data from panels A and B .
Strong ( solid circles ) and weak ( squares ) interferences are indicated .
The A residue at position -80 is hyperethylated by DEPC ( open circle ) .
Furthermore , a polyomavirus enhancer ( PEA3 ) oligonucleotide capable of binding Ets-1 and Ets-2 did not inhibit complex A formation ( Fig .
5B , lane 8 ) .
The Moloney murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat ( MSV LTR ) ( lane 2 ) and NFAT ( lane 4 ) oligonucleotides competed to a small extent , while the Drosophila E74 oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) blocked complex A formation .
CREB ( lane 6 ) , AP1 ( lane 11 ) , and mutant NFAT ( lane 5 ) oligonucleotides did not compete .
This specificity pattern suggested that the T-cell-specific protein Elf-1 , which is closely related to the Drosophila E74 protein ( 72 , 79 ) , was the most likely Ets family protein binding to PRRII in vitro .
In support of this hypothesis , an antiserum specific for Elf-1 inhibited complex A formation ( Fig .
5C , lane 2 versus lane 1 ) .

Additionally , EMSAs using Elf-1-programmed rabbit reticulo-cyte lysates yielded a major complex that comigrated with complex A ( Fig .

A second faster-mobility complex , which is also related to Elf-1 ( and perhaps represents a degradation product of Elf-1 ) , since its formation was inhibited by the antiserum to Elf-1 ( lane 5 ) but not by preimmune serum ( lane 6 ) , was often seen .
Furthermore , a monoclonal antibody to Elf-1 can supershift the Elf-1 complex to a new complex ( Fig .

Methylation and ethylation interference assays of both complexes seen with in vitro-translated Elf-1 protein yielded results identical to those obtained with complex A from nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .

Purified rHMG-I comigrated with complex B from nuclear extracts .
Similar results were obtained when either poly ( dG-dC ) or salmon sperm DNA ( data not shown ) were used .
( C ) EMSAs were performed as for panel B with salmon sperm DNA as the nonspecific competitor .

The position of the supershifted HMG-I ( Y ) -DNA-antibody ternary complex is indicated ( dot ) .
tains several AT-rich sequences ( 29 , 40 , 67 ) , the longest of which is 19 bp long ( -116 to =-98 ) and is contained within PRRII .
Several lines of evidence indicated that complex B ( Fig .
3 ) contained HMG-I ( Y ) proteins , low-molecular-weight ( 11,000 to 12,000 ) high-mobility group proteins that bind in the minor groove of AT-rich sequences .
First , complex B was not readily detected when poly ( dI-dC ) was used as a nonspecific competitor ( Fig .
3A ) , a feature exhibited by HMG-I ( Y ) ( 58 ) .
Second , in vitro-translated HMG-I and HMG-Y bound to PRRII ( Fig .
6A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Third , purified recombinant human HMG-I protein yielded a complex that comigrated with complex B ( Fig .
6B , lane 4 versus lane 1 ) .
Finally , an antiserum to HMG-I ( Y ) , but not preimmune serum , supershifted complex B ( Fig .
6B , lane 2 versus lane 3 ) .
In fact , two supershifted ternary complexes were formed , with purified HMG-I or nuclear extracts , with the lower one approximately superimposed on complex A ( lane 2 versus lane 3 and lane 5 versus lane 6 ) .
A second polyclonal antiserum to HMG-I ( Y ) , which yields only one supershifted complex with purified HMG-I ( Y ) ( 16 ) , allowed us to visualize the disappearance of complex A .
In the case of the lymphotoxin gene ( 16 ) , this antibody supershifts the faster-mobility complex containing HMG-I ( Y ) and blocks the formation of more slowly migrating complexes .
The effect of this antiserum on complex A suggests that this complex contains not only Elf-1 but also HMG-I ( Y ) or protein ( s ) antigeni-cally similar to HMG-I ( Y ) ( Fig .
6C , lane 2 versus lane 1 ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that HMG-I ( Y ) can exist as a cocomplex with Elf-1 in complex A .
The addition of control preimmune serum to the binding reaction mixtures did not alter the EMSA binding pattern seen with nuclear extract alone ( Fig .
6C , compare lanes 3 and 1 ) .
To define the DNA sequences in PRRII contacted by HMG-I ( Y ) , we performed DNase I footprinting using purified HMG-I protein and the -137/-64 oligonucleotide ( Fig .

Under the conditions used , two AT-rich regions between -128 to -123 ( region A in Fig .
7A ) and the poly ( A T ) stretch between nucleotides -116 and -98 ( region B in Fig .
7A and B ) were protected .
To confirm that these sites were contacted by HMG-I ( Y ) , we performed EMSAs with wild-type and mu Vou .

Binding reaction mixtures in lanes 1 to 5 contained 10 , 25 , 50 , 75 , and 100 ng of rHMG-I protein , respectively , and lanes 6 to 10 cach contained 75 ng of rHMG-I protein .
The M4 probe exhibited faster mobility since it is shorter than the other probes .

IL-2R « EXPRESSION 1791 tant -137/-64 oligonucleotides .
The sequences of the mutant oligonucleotides used in this study are depicted in Fig .
1B .
Titrations of purified HMG-I suggested that two complexes of different affinities could form with the -137/-64 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
7C , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
Complex C2 represented a protein-DNA interaction of high affinity , since it was apparent with the addition of only 10 ng of purified protein , while retarded complex C1 was observed only at higher concentrations of HMG-I , indicating lower-affinity interactions .
The formation of complex C1 was affected by mutation of the TATATT sequences located either at nucleotides -128 to -123 ( MS ) or at nucleotides -90 to -85 ( M6 ) , and mutation of both these sites simultaneously ( M7 ) resulted in the complete abrogation of complex C1 .
Deletion of the -116 to -98 poly ( A -T ) run ( M2 ) inhibited the formation of both complexes , C1 and C2 , suggesting that this is the major HMG-I ( Y ) binding site .
Thus , we believe that there are three potential binding sites for HMG-I ( Y ) in PRRII ( Fig .
7D ) that have various degrees of affinity for the protein .
Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) can interact in the absence of DNA .
Since it appeared that both Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) were contained in complex A , we investigated if Elf-1 could associate with HMG-I ( Y ) , which was covalently coupled to agarose beads .
Full-length Elf-1 [ Elf ( 1-619 ) ] efficiently bound to HMG-I , deletion of the N-terminal 99 amino acids [ Elf ( 100-619 ) ] did not diminish this interaction , while removal of amino acids 1 to 343 [ Elf ( 344-619 ) ] greatly decreased binding to HMG-I ( Fig .
8 ) .
An extremely weak signal was seen with Elf ( 344-619 ) , but its significance is unclear .
A construct containing residues 1 to 303 retained the ability to interact ; however , deletion of the conserved Ets homology domain between amino acids 207 and 303 ( 37 ) resulted in a total abrogation of interaction with HMG-I ( lanes 9 and 10 ) .
In agreement with the major interaction surface mapping to the Ets domain of Elf-1 , constructs that contained amino acids 100 to 304 ( lanes 11 and 12 ) , 151 to 303 ( lanes 13 and 14 ) , and 207 to 303 ( lanes 15 and 16 ) were all able to efficiently interact with HMG-I .
As a control for specificity of the Elf-1-HMG-I interaction , *°S-labeled in vitro-translated IL-7 receptor did not bind to HMG-I ( data not shown ) .
We have also found that GST-EIlf-1 can specifically retain a Gald4-HMG-I fusion protein , but not Gal4 , in the absence of contaminating DNA ( unpublished data ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that Elf-1 can interact with HMG-I in the absence of DNA through its conserved Ets domain ( residues 207 to 303 ) .
The role of HMG-I ( Y ) in facilitating the binding of other transcription factors has been previously shown ( 12 , 71 ) ; however , we found no evidence for an increase in Elf-1 binding to PRRII when HMG-I was added ( data not shown ) .
The Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) binding sites are essential , and together Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) can transactivate the -137/-64 element in COS-7 cells .
We next investigated the role of HMG-I ( Y ) and Elf-1 in activating transcription from PRRII , using cotransfection experiments with COS-7 cells .
As shown in Fig .
9A , HMG-I or Elf-1 alone weakly transactivated pTKa-137/-64 ; however , together they potently increased transcription of this reporter construct .
This synergistic effect required intact binding sites for Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) , as demonstrated by diminished activity of constructs mutated at either or both of these sites ( pTKaM1 , pTKa « M2 , and pTKaM3 ; see Fig .
1B for sequences of the mutants ) .
Additionally , we also tested the abilities of Elf-1 and HMG-I to transactivate a mutant construct , M4 or one in which only the two HMG-I ( Y ) sites identified by DNase I ( -128 to -123 and -116 to -98 ) were mutated , and obtained results similar to those with M2 ( data not shown ) .

These results suggest a functional coopera-tivity between Elf-1 and HMG-I in the activation of transcription from PRRIL Corresponding to these results with COS cells , the Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) binding sites were required for maximal activity of the -472 to +109 IL-2Ra promoter construct in Jurkat T cells .
Mutation of either the Elf-1 binding site ( IL-2R « M1 ) ( Fig .
1B ) or the dominant HMG-I ( Y ) binding site ( IL-2R « M4 ) ( Fig .
1B ) significantly decreased the overall levels of transcription ( Fig .
9B ) .
Analogous mutations in pTKa-137/-64 also resulted in decreased activity ( data not shown ) .
The fact that mutation of the Elf-1 site profoundly diminished IL-Z2Ra promoter activity , even when the -276 to -244 upstream enhancer ( PRRI ) was intact , indicates the existence of important functional interactions between Elf-1 and factors that bind to PRRL Elf-1 interacts with p50 and c-Rel proteins in the absence of DNA .
Since both PRRI and PRRII are essential for IL-2Ra « promoter activity , we speculated that these regions functionally coordinate with each other via interactions between Elf-1 and a factor ( s ) that binds to PRRI .
As shown in Fig .
10A , GST-Elf-1 bound NF- « B p50 and c-Rel contained in MT-2 T-cell extracts but not the p105 precursor form of p50 .
We obtained similar results with in vitro-translated proteins ( Fig .
10B , lanes 6 , 9 , and 12 ) and additionally demonstrated that GST-EIf-1 did not interact with NF-kB p65 ( lane 3 ) or SRF ( lane 15 ) at the concentrations used in these experiments .
The interactions of Elf-1 with NF- « B p50 and c-Rel were not mediated by contaminating DNA , since similar results were obtained when experiments were performed in the presence of ethidium bromide .
We consistently observed a small increase in the amount of NF- « B p50 retained by GST-EIf columns in the presence of HMG-I , consistent with HMG-I ( Y ) acting as `` molecular glue '' between Elf-1 and NF-kB p50 ( data not shown ) .
We confirmed the interaction of Elf-1 with c-Rel but not p65 by coprecipitation experiments ( Fig .
10C ) .
These results are provocative in view of the suggestion that c-Rel and NF-kB p50 synergize to activate the IL-2Ra promoter during T-cell activation ( 69 ) .
To identify the region of Elf-1 necessary for interaction with c-Rel , N- and C-terminal deletion constructs were labeled with 3°S-methionine by in vitro transcription-translation and evaluated for their ability to associate with c-Rel ( amino acids 1 to 300 ) coupled to agarose beads .
As shown in Figure 10D , full-length Elf-1 protein [ Elf ( 1-619 ) ] associated with c-Rel ( lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Deletion of either the N-terminal 100 amino acids ( lanes 3 and 4 ) or the C-terminal half of the protein ( lanes 5 and 6 ) did not abrogate interaction with c-Rel .
Truncated Elf-1 proteins that contained only residues 100 to 304 ( lanes 9 and 10 ) or 207 to 303 , the Ets domain ( lanes 11 and 12 ) , could still bind , while deletion of the Ets domain ( lanes 7 and 8 ) prevented interaction with c-Rel .
Thus , the highly conserved Ets domain of Elf-1 appears to be necessary and sufficient for its interaction with c-Rel as well as with HMG-IL .
DISCUSSION We have delineated a novel regulatory element ( PRRI ) essential for IL-Z2Ra « gene expression .
Unlike the previously defined -299 to -228 upstream enhancer ( PRRI ) , PRRII is more strictly conserved between mice and humans ( Fig .
1 ) ( 67 ) .
Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) bound to PRRII in an inducible manner .
Although inducible Elf-1 binding to other promoter regions has been observed ( 22 , 78 , 81 ) , to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of mitogen-induced binding of HMG-I ( Y ) to DNA .

Functional significance of Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) for IL-2R « gene regulation .

The activity of pTKa-137/-64 cotransfected with the empty vector was assigned a value of 1 , and all other values are expressed as fold increase over this value .
In addition the activities of pTKa « M1 , pTK « M2 , and pTKaM3 cotransfected with the empty vector were subtracted from the values obtained for cotransfection with Elf-1 and HMG-I for each of these reporter plasmids .
( B ) The Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) sites are required for IL-2Re expression in Jurkat cells .
Cells were transfected with wild-type ( WT ) or mutant promoter -472 to +109 IL-2Ra-CAT reporter con-structs .
JO , control plasmid JYMCAT-0 .
The M1 and M4 mutations in IL-2ReM1 and IL-2ReM4 are defined in Fig .
1B .
The data are means and standard errors of the means for three independent experiments .
The activity of JO without PMA was assigned a value of 1 , and all other activities are expressed as fold increase over this value .
nificant given that transcription of the human HMG-I ( Y ) gene is stimulated by PMA plus ionomycin ( 17 ) .
Whereas HMG-I ( Y ) proteins are widely expressed ( 14 ) , Elf-1 is lymphoid tissue specific ( 72 ) , in agreement with its playing an important role in regulating the cell-type-specific expression of the IL-2Ra « gene .
Although Elf-1 is implicated in the regulation of other T-cell-specific genes ( 22 , 78 , 81 ) , this study is the first to demonstrate direct activation of a gene by overexpression of Elf-1 .
Interestingly , transfection of Elf-1 alone was insufficient to activate transcription from PRRII in COS-7 cells , even though these cells contain endogenous HMG-I ( Y ) , suggesting that a threshold level of HMG-I ( Y ) is required .
The synergy between Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) is consistent with the fact that many Ets family proteins activate transcription in conjunction with other proteins ( 9 , 13 , 27 , 73 ) .
IL-2R « EXPRESSION 1793 In contrast to the situation with the beta interferon gene promoter , in which HMG-I ( Y ) proteins facilitate the binding of transcriptional activator proteins to DNA ( 12 , 71 ) , we have found no evidence for augmented Elf-1 binding to PRRII by HMG-I ( Y ) .
However , both Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) can be detected in the same complex in EMSAs and can interact with each other in the absence of DNA .
The Ets domain of Elf-1 was necessary and sufficient to mediate its interaction with HMG-I .
Thus , the interaction with HMG-I ( Y ) may allow Elf-1 to maintain a transcriptionally active conformation .
Another function of HMG-I ( Y ) in this scenario could be to act as molecular glue in bridging interactions between Elf-1 and NF-kB and perhaps with other DNA-binding proteins that bind in the immediate vicinity .
Furthermore , its ability to bend DNA ( 36 ) could also facilitate protein-protein interactions , thereby promoting the formation of an active transcription complex .
PRRI contains a xB site that plays an important functional role for IL-2R « expression in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 46 ; data not shown ) and in HTLV-I-transformed MT-2 cells ( 75 ) .
We have shown that deletion or mutation of the Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) binding sites in PRRII greatly diminished promoter activity even when the highly inducible PRRI was intact , in agreement with the possibility that protein-protein interactions coordinate the activities of the PRRI and PRRII .
In keeping with this idea , we have shown that Elf-1 can interact with NF- « B p50 and c-Rel , both of which have been implicated in the inducible expression of the IL-Z2Ra « gene ( 69 ) .
Furthermore , the interaction of Elf-1 with NF- « B p50 is modestly enhanced by the presence of HMG-I ( Y ) , which has also been shown to associate with NF-kB p50 ( 12 , 71 ) .
Therefore , Elf-1 may be involved in the selective binding and stabilization of specific NF- « B family proteins to PRRI during the course of T-cell activation .
Elf-1 can interact with NF-kB p50 but not its precursor p105 , suggesting that the interaction interface is masked in p105 .
Elf-1 is the first Ets family protein now known to interact with members of the NF- « B family of proteins , a finding that may have direct implications for other Elf-1 regulated genes ( 37 ) .
Mapping of the interaction surface of Elf-1 with c-Rel revealed that , as with HMG-I ( Y ) , the Ets domain was necessary and sufficient to mediate this interaction .
Therefore , the highly conserved Ets domain may be a common interaction surface generating multiple protein-protein interactions .
In keeping with this theme , we hypothesize that other specific Ets family proteins may also interact with NF-kB family proteins , thus providing a mechanism for generating further diversity in inducible gene expression in these situations .
Indeed , our preliminary studies with the Ets domain of another member of this family of proteins indicates that it can also interact with NF-kB family proteins in vitro .
Thus , the mitogen-stimulated expression of the IL-2Ra gene requires coordinated interactions between multiple regulatory proteins .
The model depicted in Fig .
11 is consistent with our data and is somewhat analogous to models proposed for the T-cell receptor « -chain gene and beta interferon genes , in which HMG proteins architecturally facilitate the formation of stereospecific enhancer complexes ( 5 , 19 , 20 , 23 , 74 ) .
In contrast to these other systems , however , cell-type-specific regulation and inducible IL-2Ra regulation involve interactions not only between adjacent proteins within a single transcriptional regulatory domain but also between two spatially separated transcriptional regulatory domains , presumably resulting in the formation of a highly specific nucleoprotein complex .
It seems likely that PRRII contributes more towards basal promoter activity and cell type specificity of expression whereas PRRI 1794 JOHN ET AL .

Elf-1 physically associates with NF- « B p50 and c-Rel but not with NF- « B p65 , p105 , or SRF .

Model of the IL-2R « promoter before ( resting T cells ) and after ( activated T cells ) mitogen stimulation depicting direct interactions between NFxB , Elf-1 , and HMG-I ( Y ) .
Two schematics are depicted for the activated state ; the upper schematic depicts direct Elf-1-NF « B interactions , whereas the lower schematic additionally shows the possibility that HMG-I may enhance the Elf-1-NF- « B p50 interaction .
It is possible that both models depicting the activated state exist at the same time .
In addition to the three HMG-I ( Y ) binding sites depicted in Fig .
7C , we have evidence for a fourth site between nucleotides -183 and -153 ; hence , four HMG-I ( Y ) molecules are shown contacting DNA .
Although no HMG-I ( Y ) is shown bound to the promoter in resting T cells , we believe that there is some binding to the major HMG-I ( Y ) site in these cells .

15 , 1995 more potently contributes to the inducibility of the IL-2Ra gene .
This hypothesis is consistent with the results in Fig .
9B , showing that mutation of the Elf-1 site significantly diminishes transcriptional activity but has a minimal effect on the PMA inducibility of the construct .
Since the IL-2Ra « gene is not expressed in unstimulated normal T cells , we hypothesize that the constitutive activity of PRRII in Jurkat cells reflects the endogenous levels of Elf-1 and HMG-I ( Y ) in Jurkat cells whereas no Elf-1 is found in resting T cells .
It will be interesting to determine if the two- to threefold inducibility of PRRII in Jurkat cells results from posttranslational modification ( s ) of Elf-1 .
PRRII also appears to play a role in coordinating and amplifying signals received from other parts of the promoter since a point mutation in the Elf-1 binding site is sufficient to abrogate transcription from the IL-2Ra « promoter .
In this re-gard , it is relevant that Elf-1 can bind TFIIB in vitro ( unpublished observations ) .
Thus , the identification of this novel regulatory region of the IL-2Ra promoter further elucidates the molecular mechanisms that operate to ensure the precise expression of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor .
