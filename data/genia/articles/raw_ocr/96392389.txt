Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central issue in herpesvirus biology .
Epithelial cells are the major site of lytic EBV replication within the human host , and viral reactivation occurs in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas .
It is known that expression of a single viral immediate-early protein , BZLF1 , is sufficient to initiate the switch from latent to lytic infection in B cells .
Cellular regulation of BZLF1 transcription is therefore thought to play a key role in regulating the stringency of viral latency .
Here we show that , unexpectedly , expression of another viral immediate-early protein , BRLF1 , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific fashion .
Therefore , the mechanisms leading to disruption of EBV latency appear to be cell-type specific .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a human herpesvirus associated with lymphoid and epithelial cell malignancies ( 1 , 2 ) .
A critical aspect of herpesvirus biology is the maintenance and disruption of viral latency .
EBV infection is generally latent in B cells but commonly productive in epithelial cells ( 3-5 ) .
EBV reactivation and replication in latently infected B cells can be activated by treatment with agents such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) or cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin ( 6 , 7 ) .
These agents activate expression of the immediate-early ( IE ) protein , BZLF1 ( Z ) ( 8 , 9 ) .
Z , a transcriptional activator , is a member of the basic leucine zipper ( bZip ) family which binds to AP1-like Z-response elements in EBV early promoters ( 10-12 ) .
Expression of transfected Z in latently infected lymphocytes is sufficient to trigger the lytic cycle ( 13-15 ) .
In addition to Z , EBV has one other IE protein , BRLF1 ( R ) .
Like Z , R is a transcriptional activator and sequence-specific DNA-binding protein ( 16-22 ) .
A number of early EBV promoters contain upstream R binding sites ( a G+C-rich motif ) and are transcriptionally activated by R in transient transfection assays .
Certain early viral promoters require both Z and R for maximal transcriptional activation ( 13 , 19 , 21 ) .
In contrast to Z , expression of transfected R in EBV-infected B cells does not disrupt latency ( 19 ) .
The finding that expression of Z is sufficient to disrupt viral latency has led to a model in which lytic EBV infection results from activation of BZLFI1 transcription by cellular transcription factors ( 23 ) .
The Z protein can potentially be derived from two different promoters , Zp and Rp ( 16 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
The more proximal promoter , Zp ( from which most , if not all , Z protein is derived ) , directs transcription of a 1.0-kb message encoding the Z protein alone .
The distal promoter , Rp , directs transcription of a 2.8-kb message encoding the R protein , and The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
9194 potentially the Z protein as well ( if the message can be bicistronically translated ) ( 16 ) .
Zp and Rp are normally inactive in latently infected cells , but agents that disrupt viral latency such as PMA and anti-immunoglobulin activate expression of Zp , as well as Rp ( 8 , 9 ) , with similar kinetics .
Although the phenotype of virus lacking Z or R has not been reported , it is likely that both Z and R are required for disruption of viral latency .
Assuming that this is the case , transfected Z may activate Rp in latently infected B cells , and the resultant combination of Z and R then leads to disruption of viral latency .
In contrast , transfected R may be incapable of activating Zp within the endogenous viral genome .
The effects of Z and R upon Zp and Rp transcription have not been carefully studied except in transient reporter assays .
In these types of experiments , Z has been reported to activate its own promoter ( Zp ) ( 24 ) as well as the R promoter ( Rp ) ( 25 ) , and R has been shown to activate Rp at a low level through an apparently non-binding mechanism ( 25 , 26 ) .
The effect of R on Zp expression has not been reported .
In this paper , we demonstrate that expression of the R IE protein is sufficient to disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific manner .
This ability of R to induce lytic viral infection in epithelial cells , but not lymphoid cells , correlates with its ability to activate Zp and Rp expression from the endogenous viral genome only in epithelial cells .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that in contrast to the results of plasmid-based reporter assays , transfected Z primarily activates Rp in the endogenous viral genome , rather than Zp .
These results suggest that in epithelial cells ( the major site of lytic EBV infection in vivo ) , cellular transcription factors which activate Rp may initiate the disruption of viral latency .

RESULTS R Activates Early Gene Expression in Epithelial Cells But Not Lymphoid Cells .
To compare the ability of R versus Z to induce lytic viral infection in different cell types , we transfected the R or Z gene products ( under the control of a strong constitutive promoter ) into various types of latently infected cells .
Induction of the EBV lytic cycle was monitored by the appearance of an early viral protein , BMRF1 ( early antigen-diffuse ) , which is not expressed in latently infected cells .
As shown for the Raji EBV-infected Burkitt lymphocyte line in Fig .

Similar results as shown in 4 and B were obtained with another Burkitt cell line , P3HR1 , and another lymphoblastoid cell line , SFC4 ( data not shown ) .

( Fig .
2b ) , expression of Z , but not R , induced early antigen expression , although in these cells Z was considerably less efficient in disrupting viral latency than in the Burkitt lines .
In contrast , expression of either R or Z induced early viral protein expression in two different EBV-infected epithelial cell lines ( Fig .
2 c and d ) .
Given that lytic viral infection likely requires the presence of Z , as well as R , the ability of transfected R to induce Z expression in epithelial cells ( from the endogenous viral genome ) was assessed by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific to the Z protein .
As shown in Fig .
2 ¢ and d , epithelial cells transfected with R also expressed the IE protein Z , indicating that R can activate Z expression in this cell type .
Similar results were obtained using a BRLF1 expression vector driven by the simian virus 40 promoter .
Thus , expression of R is sufficient to activate the lytic viral cascade in epithelial cells but not lymphoid cells .
R Induces Lytic EBV Replication in Epithelial Cells .
The previous results indicate that R can activate expression of at least two lytic EBV genes ( BZLF1 and BMRF1 ) in epithelial cells .
However , many different EBV genes are required for lytic replication , and therefore the early gene expression induced by R in epithelial cells might be abortive and not support successful viral replication .
To compare the ability of Z versus R to induce lytic viral replication in epithelial cells , we performed Southern blot analyses to distinguish latent ( episomal ) versus lytic ( linear ) EBV genomes as described ( 32 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 , expression of Z , as expected , resulted in conversion of the virus from the episomal to the linear form in both lymphoid cells ( data not shown ) or epithelial cells .
Consistent with the immunoblot analysis , expression of R also induced lytic replication of the EBV genome in epithelial cells .
These results indicate that R is able to induce full lytic infection in epithelial cells , not simply abortive expression of viral early proteins .

The cellular DNA was isolated 48 h after transfection , cut with the restriction enzyme BamHI , and analyzed by Southern blot using a -labeled riboprobe spanning the 1.9-kb XhoI sequence of EBV .
This assay ( 32 ) distinguishes between fused versus unfused viral termini .
The latent ( episomal ) virus contains only fused termini , whereas lytic replication results in an increased number of fused termini ( due to replicative intermediates ) as well as the appearance of unfused termini ( due to the replicated linear form ) .

USA 93 ( 1996 ) reactivation ( 23 ) , the activation of Zp transcription by cellular factors is the initial event leading to disruption of viral latency .
In this model , the Z protein then activates Rp , as well as further activating Zp .
The combined transactivator functions of Z and R then lead to an irreversible activation of the lytic cascade .
However , the effects of transfected Z and R upon Zp and Rp expression within the endogenous viral genome have not been well studied .
Using an RNase protection assay , we examined the effects of transfected R and Z upon Zp and Rp expression in different cell types .
The 1.0-kb BZLF ! 1 RNA ( arising from Zp ) and 2.8-kb BRLFI plus BZLF1 RNA ( arising from Rp ) were detected using an RNA probe as shown in Fig .
42 .
Disruption of viral latency induced by either cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin ( Akata cells ) or PMA/IUdR treatment ( D98 and NPC-KT cells ) activated Zp , as well as Rp , expression in each cell type ( Fig .
4b ) .
Similar results were obtained using PMA to disrupt viral latency in either Raji or Akata cells ( data not shown ) .
In contrast to the effects of immunoglobulin cross-linking and PMA , transfected Z primarily activated Rp ( with little , if any , Zp transcription observed ) in both the Raji B-cell line ( Fig .
4c ) and the epithelial D98/HE-R-1 cell line ( Fig .
40 ) .
This result is in conflict with the results of plasmid-based reporter gene assays , in which Z can activate its own promoter ( 24 ) .
Transfected R did not activate either Zp or Rp in the Raji cell line ( Fig .
4¢c ) , consistent with the inability of R to disrupt viral latency in these cells .
In contrast to the results seen in Burkitt cells , R activated both Zp and Rp in the epithelial D98/HE-R-1 cell line ( Fig .
40 ) .
Similar results were obtained in the epithelial NPC-KT cell line ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the ability of transfected R to disrupt viral latency in epithelial cells , but not lymphoid cells , correlates with its ability to activate Zp and Rp transcription from the endogenous viral genome in an epithelial cell-specific manner .
The R Transactivator Function Is Not Cell Type-Specific in Plasmid-Based Reporter Assays .
To determine if R transactivator function is impaired in B cells , we performed plasmid-based reporter gene assays using an early EBV promoter construct previously shown to be directly bound and transcriptionally activated by R ( 20 , 22 ) .
These results indicate that the transcriptional activator function of transfected R in plasmid-based assays is similar in B cells and epithelial cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
Therefore , the inability of transfected R to activate viral replication in B cells does not appear to be due to the absence of an essential trans-acting factor required for R transactivator function in B cells .
DISCUSSION This report demonstrates that the EBV IE protein , R , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific fashion .
Previous studies of EBV reactivation have examined the mechanisms by which viral latency is disrupted in B cells , and have identified the Z IE protein as the critical initiator of this process .
However , since lytic EBV replication in vivo occurs primarily in epithelial cells , rather than B cells , induction of lytic viral replication by R may be an equally important mechanism for disrupting viral latency in the human host .
The ability of transfected R to disrupt viral latency in epithelial cells , but not B cells , correlates with its ability to induce expression of the Zp and Rp promoters only in epithelial cells .
R is a transcriptional activator which binds to specific G+C-rich motifs present in many early EBV promoters .
The finding that R activates expression of both Zp and Rp in the endogenous genome is somewhat surprising , given that neither of these promoters is thought to contain R binding sites ( 18 , 26 ) .
However , we ( and others ) have previously shown that R binding sites can function from a distance as enhancer elements ( 19 , 20 , 22 ) , and more than 300 putative R binding Microbiology : Zalani et al .

( a ) RNase protection assays were performed using a single-strand *°P-labeled riboprobe .
Hybridization of the probe to Zp- and Rp-derived mRNA results in protected fragments of 115 and 148 bp , respectively .
The transfected BZLF1 vector yields an 80-bp protected fragment ( not shown ) .

sites have been located in the EBV genome ( 18 ) .
It thus remains possible that distant R binding sites ( not contained within the previously studied Zp and Rp reporter constructs ) mediate R-induced activation of Zp and Rp within the context of the viral genome .
Assuming this is the case , then the Rp and Zp promoters are presumably less accessible to direct binding by R in B cells .
Cell-specific differences in the methylation state of the Zp and Rp promoters , or differences in the chromatin configuration around these promoters , might exclude R binding in B cells , while allowing such binding in epithelial cells .
Alternatively , as we have previously suggested ( 26 ) , R may activate certain promoters through a nonbinding mechanism .
If the R-induced activation of Zp and Rp is mediated through this novel mechanism , then the trans-acting cellular factors required for this process may be more available in epithelial cells than in B cells .
The domains of R essential for transactivator function have been shown to be cell-type dependent ( 33 ) , suggesting that R-induced transactivation may be mediated by different mechanisms in different cell types .
Another group has previously reported that R expressed in vaccinia virus can activate early gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines , but not Burkitt cells ( 34 ) .
This group did not define whether the R vaccinia virus induced abortive lytic infection ( limited to early gene expression ) or progressed to full viral replication .
However , our results here clearly indicate that transfected R alone ( in contrast to Z ) can not disrupt viral latency in lymphoblastoid cells .
It remains possible that a vaccinia virus-encoded protein allows R to perform this function in B cells .
It has been previously reported that the Z gene product can activate expression of Zp in transient transfection assays ( 24 ) .
Based on the results of such assays , a model for EBV reactivation has been proposed ( 23 ) in which Zp is initially activated by cellular transcription factors , followed by autoactivation of Zp by its own gene product , and Z-induced activation of Rp .
The precise cellular transcription factors initially activating Zp have yet to be defined , although both CREB and API have been suggested ( 35 , 36 ) .
The results here indicate that transfected Z primarily activates Rp , rather than Zp , in the endogenous genome .
Another group has recently reported a similar result ( 37 ) .
Therefore , the results of transient plasmid-based assays may not reflect the sequence of events in the actual genome .
Instead , as shown in Fig .
6 ( model 1 ) , our data suggest that in B cells , activation of Zp by cellular transcription factors leads to subsequent activation of Rp , rather than Zp .
The combination of the Z and R transcription factors would then lead to maximal induction of early EBV promoters ( 13 , 19 , 21 ) .
From the results presented here , we now propose an additional mechanism for disruption of viral latency in epithelial cells .
This pathway would be initiated by cellular transcription factors known to activate Rp ( such as Zif268 and Sp1 ) ( 26 , 31 ) , rather than Zp .
The resultant R protein would then lead to further activation of 9198 Microbiology : Zalani et al .

Nevertheless , since the major site of lytic EBV replication in the human host is thought to be within epithelial cells rather than B cells ( 2 ) , this newly recognized pathway for viral reactivation may in fact play a critical role in vivo for transmission of virus .
The identification of the specific cellular factors that disrupt viral latency will ultimately be required for a full understanding of this key aspect of herpesvirus biology .
Our results presented here suggest that cellular factors that activate Rp , as well as Zp , may mediate disruption of viral latency in epithelial cells .
