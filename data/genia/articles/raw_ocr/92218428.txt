From the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599-7295 The promoter of the major histocompatibility class II gene DRA contains an octamer element ( ATTTGCAT ) that is required for efficient DRA expression in B cells .
Several DNA-binding proteins are known to bind this sequence .
The best characterized are the B cell-specific OTF-2 and the ubiquitous OTF-1 .
This report directly demonstrates that OTF-2 but not OTF-1 regulates the DRA gene .
In vitro transcription analysis using protein fractions enriched for the octamer-binding protein OTF-2 demonstrate a positive functional role for OTF-2 in DRA gene transcription .
In contrast , OTF-1-enriched protein fractions did not affect DRA gene transcription although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene .
Recombinant OTF-2 protein produced by in vitro transcription/translation could also enhance DRA gene transcription in vitro .
In vivo transient transfection studies utilizing an OTF-2 expression vector resulted in similar findings : that OTF-2 protein enhanced DRA gene transcription , and that this effect requires an intact octamer element .
Together these results constitute the first direct evidence of a positive role for the lymphoid-specific octamer-binding factor in DRA gene transcription .
Major histocompatibility ( MHC ) class II proteins control the level of the immune response by functioning as ligands for the activation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes ( 1 , 2 ) .
In addition , class II proteins transmit signals which activate B lymphocytes ( 3 ) .
MHC class II protein expression is limited to a few cell types , most notably on B cells , and is subject to transcriptional gene regulation .

tion of class II expression is mainly mediated by elements in their promoters , presumably via proteins that bind to these elements .
Several cis-acting elements critical for MHC class II expression have been defined in B lymphocytes and other cell types including the W , X , and Y elements ( 4 ) .
Furthermore , the class II DRA promoter contains an octamer element , ATTTGCAT , that is required for its efficient expression in B cells ( 5 , 6 ) ( see Fig .
14 ) .
This octamer element is identical to the octamer elements important for the expression of a variety of other genes including the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) light and heavy chains ( 7 , 8 ) , the human histone H2B ( 9 ) , and the U1 , U2 , and U4 snRNA genes ( 10 ) .
The octamer element has therefore been determined to be a functional element for genes expressed in restricted cell types as well as for genes expressed ubiquitously .
Nuclear proteins have been defined that bind specifically to the octamer element .
These include both the ubiquitous protein OTF-1 ( also referred to as oct-1 , NF-A1 , OBP100 , NFIII , and oct-B3 ) ( 11-17 ) and OTF-2 , classically referred to as a lymphoid-restricted protein ( also referred to as oct-2 , NF-A2 , oct-2A , and oct-B2 ) ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 19 ) .
Oct-3 through oct-7 have been identified in various mouse tissues at different stages of development ( 20 , 21 ) , and related proteins have been identified in adult brain ( 22 ) .
Since oct-3 through oct-7 are not present in the cell types used in this study , they will not be discussed further .
Both the OTF-1 and OTF-2 proteins bind to the octamer element with identical methylation interference and DNase I footprinting patterns ( 11 , 19 ) .
Both proteins have been purified from cells ( 11 , 19 ) and the corresponding genes have been isolated ( 17 , 23-27 ) .
Because of its restricted tissue distribu-tion , OTF-2 was hypothesized to be at least partially responsible for the restricted cell type expression of the Ig gene ( 16 , 18 , 19 ) and the MHC class II gene , DRA ( 5 ) .
In fact , it has been shown that purified OTF-2 can activate transcription of Ig heavy and light chain promoters in vitro ( 19 , 28 , 29 ) .
It was also demonstrated that OTF-1 could activate transcription of these same Ig promoters in vitro , but less efficiently ( 28 , 29 ) .
The difference in OTF-2 's versus OTF-1 's ability to activate transcription from these two promoters has been suggested to be due to the requirement for an additional B-cell-specific component ( 29 , 30 ) or due to quantitative differences in the amount of octamer-binding protein present ( 28 ) .
The context of the octamer element within the promoter may also be important ( 28 ) .
It has been hypothesized that the B cell-specific octamer-binding protein , OTF-2 , is required for MHC class II DRA promoter function in B cells , but this has yet to be shown directly .
In this report , we demonstrate a functional role for the octamer-binding protein OTF-2 in MHC class II gene expression using both in vitro transcription and in vivo transient 7677 7678 transfection systems .
This is similar to the positive functional role for OTF-2 observed in Ig gene transcription ( 19 , 28 , 29 ) .
In contrast to the Ig system , however , OTF-1 appears not to play a role in transcription from the MHC class II DRA promoter in a B cell system , whereas it can activate transcription of the testis H2A histone ( TH2A ) gene in our system .
These findings underscore that even though there are several similarities between the Ig and the DRA genes , including their expression in B lymphocytes , there are significant differences in their transcriptional regulation .
The differences observed may be due to the context of the octamer element in the promoters of these genes .
The octamer element upstream of a TATA box seems sufficient to confer B cell-specific promoter activity of Ig genes ( 31 , 32 ) , whereas MHC class II genes require additional promoter elements for expression ( 33 , 34 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids , Probes , and Competitors-The construction of plasmids pWToct and pMUToct ( Fig .
14 ) have been described in detail ( 5 ) .
They contain wild type DRA X and Y elements and either a wild type or mutant octamer element placed upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .
The human OTF-2 cDNA was isolated by polymerase chain reac-tion-based cloning from a human B lymphoblastoid cell line , Raji , using published DNA sequences ( 26 ) .
First strand cDNA was synthesized by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Life Sciences Biologicals , St. Petersburg , FL ) from 2 ug of oligo ( dT ) ( Boeh-ringer Mannheim Biochemicals , Indianapolis , IN ; 10-mer ) primed mRNA isolated by batch elution ( 35 ) from 10° log phase Raji cells .
Five percent of the reaction mixture was subjected to 35 cycles of amplification by polymerase chain reaction in a DNA thermal cycler ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus Corp. , Emeryville , CA ) using 50 pM each kinased primers of the sequence 5 { -ACGATGGTTCACTCCAGCATGG-3 ' and 5-CTGCCATCAGGCTGGTAAGG-3 ' ( 26 ) .
The temperature profile of amplification was 94 °C , 5 min , 55 °C , 1 min , 72 °C , 1 min for 1 cycle ; 94 °C , 30 s , 55 °C , 30 s , 72 °C , 1 min for 30 cycles ; and 94 °C , 30 s , 55°C , 30 s , 72°C , 7 min for 1 cycle .
Products were separated on a 2 % Nuseive low melt-agarose gel ( Seakem , FMC Corp. , Rockland , ME ) .
Three microliters of remelted agarose containing the 1.4-kb DNA band predicted for OTF-2 was directly ligated to de-phosphorylated Smal-digested pGEM3Z ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Sequence of the resulting clone determined by dideoxy chain termination ( 36 ) was identical to the published sequence ( 26 ) .
To obtain the OTF-2 expression vector , human OTF-2 cDNA cloned into pGEM3Z ( described above ) was digested with KpnI and Xbal in the polylinker region to release the 1.4-kb OTF-2 cDNA , which was isolated electrophoretically and then electroeluted from the gel .
The OTF-2 cDNA was then subcloned into the compatible cloning site of the plasmid pCMVS ( 37 ) .
pCMVS5 was a gift from D. W. Russell ( University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ) and contains the human cytomegalovirus early promoter ( CMV ) , a linker containing multiple cloning sites , and transcription termination and polyadenylation signals from human growth hormone ( Fig .
1B ) .
Li-gation was performed at room temperature for 4 h in a 20-4l volume .
The reaction was stopped by adding 1 al of 0.5 m EDTA , pH 8.0 .
Southern and sequencing analyses revealed that the 1.4-kb OTF-2 was properly subcloned into pCMV5 .
This clone was named plasmid pCMV5-OTF-2 .
The DNA probes and competitors used for gel mobility shift assays consisted of complementary oligonucleotides that were resuspended in annealing buffer ( 38 ) , boiled 5 min , and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature to anneal .
Probes were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( U. S. Biochemicals , Cleveland , OH ) and [ y- '' *P|ATP prior to annealing and purification on a NENsorb column ( Du Pont-New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) .
The sequence of strand 1 of WToct is : 5-AGAGTAATTGATTTGCATTTTAA-TGGTCAG-3 ' .
The sequence of strand 1 of MUToct is : AGAGTAA-TTGCGGGTCATTTTAATGGTCAG-3 ' , where the mutated sequence is underlined .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Octamer-binding Protein ( OBP ) Enrichment-Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification ( 39 ) of the Dignam procedure ( 40 ) .
2 Liters of log phase cells were pelleted , washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline , and OTF-2 Regulates DRA Gene Transcription resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of Buffer A ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 0.75 mM spermidine , 0.15 mM spermine , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 1 mm DTT , 10 mM KCl ) .

The nuclei were agitated 20 min at 4 °C and the extract centrifuged at 150,000 x g for 90 min .
The extract was dialyzed 2 x 90 min against 100 volumes of Buffer D ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 17 % glycerol , 100 mM KCl , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.2 mM EGTA , 2 mm DTT , 12.5 mm MgC ) ; , 2 gM 1,10-phenanthroline , 2 uM 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin , 0.4 uM E-64 ) .
Extracts were then centrifuged 20 min at 16,000 rpm in a Beckman S $ S34 rotor and the supernatant stored in small aliquots at -70 °C .
Extracts were not freeze/thawed more than two times for use in in vitro transcription reactions .
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay ( Richmond , CA ) .
Octamer-binding proteins were enriched by incubating 1 ml of nuclear extract with 1 ml of octamer-conjugated Sepharose affinity matrix .
The affinity matrix was prepared according to the method of Kadonaga and Tjian ( 41 ) using concatamers of the double stranded oligonucleotides ; _ TGGTC-3 ' and 3-TCTCATTAACTAAACGTAAAATTACCAGC-TAG-5 ' , to couple to the matrix .
Extract was incubated with affinity matrix and rotated end-over-end for 1 h at 4°C .
Octamer-binding proteins were eluted with 200 al of AC1000 buffer ( Buffer D with 1 M KCl ) and dialyzed against 100 volumes of Buffer D using a BRL microdialyzer ( Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Extracts were checked for complete depletion of octamer-binding proteins by gel mobility shift assay .
In Vitro Transcription/Translation of Recombinant OTF-2 Pro-tein-In vitro transcription/translation of recombinant OTF-2 was performed as described by the manufacturer of the kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .

The DNA template was removed following transcription by adding RQ1 RNase-free DNase to a concentration of 1 unit/ug of DNA , incubating for 30 min at 37 °C , extracting sequentially with phenol : chloroform and chloroform , and precipitating the RNA with ethanol .
RNA was resuspended in H0 and stored at -70 °C .
For in vitro translation of OTF-2 protein , 35 ul of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , 7 ul of H ; O , 1 ul of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor ( at 40 units/pl ) , 1 gl of 1 mM amino acid mixture ( minus methionine ) , 2 ug of RNA substrate in H ; O that had been heated at 67 °C for 10 min and immediately cooled on ice to decrease secondary structure , and 4 L1 of [ *°S ) methionine ( 1200 Ci/mmol ) at 10 mCi/ml ( Du Pont-New England Nuclear ) or 4 ul of unlabeled methionine were mixed in a final volume of 50 ul and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min .
Translation products were analyzed on 10 % SDS-polyacryl-amide gels and by gel mobility shift assay , and were stored at -70 °C .
Translation products were chromatographed on Sephadex G-25 or G-10 prior to use to reconstitute in vitro transcription reactions .
Gel Mobility Shift and in Vitro Transcription-Gel mobility shift reactions were performed essentially as described ( 15 ) .
DNA binding was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature in a 20-ul volume containing either 3 ug of nuclear extract or 2 ul of in vitro transcribed/translated protein , 20,000-50,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe , 1 ug of poly ( dIdC ) -poly ( dIdC ) ( Pharmacia LKB , Piscataway , NJ ) in a buffer containing 20 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mm EDTA , 10 mm Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , and 2.5 mM MgCls .
Double stranded DNA competitor , when used , was added at 100-fold molar excess .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe by electrophoresis on a 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in Tris glycine buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 190 mM glycine , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8.3 ) .
After drying the gel , complexes were visualized by autoradiography .
Transcription reactions were performed essentially as described ( 39 ) .
The plasmids used as templates for in vitro transcription , pWToct and pMUToct , are schematically drawn in Fig .
14 and have been described in detail ( 5 ) .
They contain wild type DRA X and Y OTF-2 Regulates DRA Gene Transcription elements and either a wild type or mutant octamer element upstream of the bacterial CAT gene .
The TH2A-CAT plasmid contains 248 bp of the rat testis H2A histone promoter upstream of the CAT gene ( 42 ) and was kindly provided by Dr. Chi-Bom Chae ( University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC ) .
The adenovirus major late pro-moter-CAT plasmid contains 170 bp of the adenovirus major late promoter upstream of the CAT gene ( 43 ) , and was kindly provided by Dr. Al Baldwin ( University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC ) .
Template DNA was linearized with Neol , and precipitated prior to use in the reactions .
The reaction consisted of template DNA ( 1.5 ug ) , 0.4 mM each ATP , UTP , and CTP , 1 mM creatine phosphate , 0.14 mM EDTA , 1 Ll of [ « - '' P ] GTP , and 15 al of extract in a final volume of 25 pl .
Transcription was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30 °C .
The reaction was stopped by adding 275 ul of stop solution ( 8 M urea , 0.5 % SDS , 10 mm Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 10 mM EDTA ) plus 1000 cpm of an internal standard radiolabeled 494-nucleotide Sp6 transcript to detect differences in recovery as previously published ( 39 ) .
After extraction with phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 20:20:1 ) , the phenol layer was back-extracted with 165 ul of urea extraction buffer ( 7 M urea , 350 mM NaCl , 10 mm Tris , pH 8.0 , 10 mM EDTA , 1 % SDS ) plus 25 ug of tRNA carrier .
The supernatants were combined and re-extracted with phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with 95 % ethanol .
After washing in 70 % ethanol , the RNA was heated at 90 °C for 2 min and electrophoresed on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea .
The gel was then autoradiographed .
Transient Transfection of Plasmid DNA and CAT Assay-Cells were transiently transfected using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporation apparatus which was set at 200 V and 960 microfarad .
Five to six X 10° cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of complete growth medium containing 7.5 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum : RPMI 1640 for HSB and Joklik 's modified minimal essential medium for HeLa .
The cell suspension was then placed into the electroporation chamber , followed by addition of DNA ( 10 ug of expression plasmid , 10 ug of reporter plasmid ) , mixing , and application of the voltage pulse .
The cells were immediately transferred to a 25-cm > flask containing 10 ml of complete growth medium .
Approximately 48 h after transfection , the cells were counted , harvested by centrifugation , washed once with phosphate-buffered saline , and resuspended in 50 ul of 0.25 M Tris-HCl , pH 7.6 .
Cells were then lysed by 3-4 freeze-thaw cycles , and cellular debris was removed by microcentrifugation for 5 min .
After heat inactivating the extract at 65 °C for 10 min ( 44 ) , the same cell number equivalents of the resulting extract were assayed for CAT activity .
The CAT assay was performed as described ( 5 ) , except that the final concentration of Tris-HCI was 0.25 M and the final volume of each reaction was 150 wl .
The CAT activities were analyzed by TLC and autoradiography .
Percent acetylation of chloramphenicol was quantified by cutting out and counting sections of the TLC plates in liquid scintillation fluid .
The fold induction of DRA-CAT expression by QOTF-2 protein was calculated as the percent acetylation produced by pWToct in the presence of pCMV5-OTF-2 divided by percent acetylation produced by pWToct in the presence of pCMV5 .
Additionally , the requirement for an intact octamer element for OTF-2 induction was determined as above except by using the pMUToct reporter plasmid .
RESULTS OBPs from B Cells but Not from HeLa Cells Can Partially Reconstitute DRA Transcription in Vitro-To assess whether OBPs from B cells which contain both OTF-1 and OTF-2 or OBPs from HeLa cells which only contain OTF-1 could reconstitute OTF-depleted DRA gene transcription in vitro , we compared the effects of OBPs enriched from these two cell lines on DRA transcription in an in vitro run-off transcription assay .
A plasmid containing the basal DRA promoter upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was used as a template for transcription ( Fig .
14 ) .
A schematic depiction of the strategy used for the transcription experiments is shown in Fig .
24 .
OBPs were enriched by eluting HeLa or B cell octamer-binding proteins from an octamer element DNA affinity column .
In Fig .
2B , a gel mobility shift assay ( 15 ) was used to test for the presence and specificity of octamer-binding factors in the material eluted off the column .

pMUToct is identical to pWToct except mutant octamer sequence replaces wild type octamer sequence .
B , schematic representation of OTF-2 expression plasmid , pCMV5-OTF-2 .
Human OTF-2 cDNA was cloned into the compatible cloning site of the plasmid pCMVS .
pCMVS5 contains the human cytomegalovirus early promoter , a multiple cloning site linker , and transcription termination and polyadenylation signals from human growth hormone .
pChvs and OTF-2 were identified based on published profiles from ours and other laboratories ( 6 , 19 , 28 , 33 ) .
Lanes 1 and 2 are whole nuclear extract from Namalwa B cells and HeLa cells , respectively .
Both cells contain OTF-1 protein ( upper arrow ) , but only the B cell line contains OTF-2 protein ( lower arrow ) .
Namalwa B cell OBPs eluted off the octamer element affinity matrix contain both OTF-1 and OTF-2 ( lane 3 ) which are specifically competed with an excess of octamer competitor ( lane 4 ) , but not with the same amount of a mutant octamer competitor ( lane 5 ) .
Hela cell OBPs eluted off the octamer element affinity matrix contain OTF-1 ( lane 6 ) and another complex , which can be specifically competed with an excess of octamer element competitor ( lane 7 ) , but not with mutant octamer competitor ( lane 8 ) .
These OBP -enriched extracts were used as a source of OTF proteins to reconstitute DRA gene transcription in a B cell nuclear extract depleted of octamer-binding proteins .
The extract was depleted of OBPs by passage over an octamer element affinity matrix , and the depletion of octamer-binding proteins confirmed by gel mobility shift assay ( data not shown ) .
DRA in vitro transcription using nondepleted B cell extracts as a source of transcription factors resulted in the correct 595-nucleotide run-off transcript ( left arrow ) ( Fig .
2C , lanes 1 and 4 ) , whereas octamer-depleted B cell extracts produced no DRA transcription ( lanes 2 and 5 ) .
It is critical that any differences in OTF-1 and OTF-2 activity would not be due to different amounts of these proteins used for reconstitution , therefore equivalent binding activity was determined by titration of these OBP -enriched fractions in a gel mobility shift assay ( data not shown ) .
B cell and HeLa cell OBPs containing similar amounts of OTF-1 binding activity were added to the depleted transcription reaction ( see Fig .
24 ) .
B cell OBPs could partially reconstitute transcription ( lane 3 ) , whereas Hela cell OBPs could not ( lane 6 ) .
The partial reconstitution with B cell OBPs averaged 35 % as quantitated relative to the level of internal 494-nucleotide standard ( arrowhead ) in three separate experiments as determined by densitometric scanning of autoradi-ographs .
When the same type of experiment was done using a plasmid containing a mutated octamer element as a transcription template , no effect of B cell OBPs was seen ( data not shown ) .
As a control to demonstrate that the Hela cell OBPs were functional , we determined that HeLa OBPs could reconstitute octamer-depleted transcription from the TH2ZA 7680 B cell nuclear extract octamer DNA affinity column deplete OBPs B cell nuclear extract depleted of octamer binding proteins 4 DRA promoter Neo !

A , flow diagram of the strategy used for DRA in vitro transcription reconstitution experiments .
B cell nuclear extract was depleted of octamer-binding proteins by passage over an octamer DNA affinity column .
This octamer-binding protein-depleted extract did not support DRA run-off transcription ( see C ) .
Octamer-binding proteins enriched from B cells ( which contain OTF-2 and OTF-1 ) or from HeLa cells ( which contain OTF-1 ) were assessed for their ability to reconstitute DRA gene transcription .
B , gel mobility shift of octamer-binding proteins enriched from B cell and HeLa cell nuclear extracts .
B cell ( lane 1 ) or HeLa cell ( lane 2 ) nuclear extracts , and octamer-binding proteins enriched from B cells ( lanes 3-5 ) or octamer-binding proteins enriched from HeLa cells ( lanes 6-8 ) were incubated with a radiolabeled octamer DNA probe in the presence of no competitor ( lanes 1-3 and 6 ) , wild type octamer competitor ( lanes 4 and 7 ) , or mutant octamer competitor ( lanes 5 and 8 ) .
The resulting complexes were electrophoresed on a 6 % nondenaturing Tris glycine polyacrylamide gel .
C , functional analysis of B cell or HeLa cell OBPs in DRA in vitro transcription .
DRA in vitro transcription using B cell nuclear extracts ( lanes 1 and 4 ) or B cell nuclear extracts depleted of octamer-binding proteins ( lanes 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) .
B cell OBPs were added to lane 3 , HeLa cell OBPs were added to lane 6 , and no OBPs were added to lanes 2 and 5 .
The correct DRA run-off transcription product ( left arrow ) is indicated .
As a control for HeLa cell OBP OTF-2 Regulates DRA Gene Transcription gene ( Fig .
2C , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
These experiments demonstrate that B cell-derived OBPs can partially reconstitute octamer-depleted DRA gene transcription , whereas HeLa cell-derived OBPs can not .
Additionally , this effect is dependent on an intact octamer element .
Cloned OTF-2 Protein Positively Affects DRA Gene Transcription in Vitro-Octamer-binding proteins enriched from B cells were able to partially reconstitute octamer-depleted DRA transcription , in contrast to octamer-binding proteins enriched from HeLa cells .
Since B cells make OTF-2 protein and HeLa cells do not , this suggests that OTF-2 was responsible for the reconstitution of octamer-depleted DRA gene transcription that we had observed .
We tested this directly using cloned OTF-2 protein .
For these experiments , a plasmid coding for human OTF-2 was utilized as a source of recombinant OTF-2 protein .
OTF-2 protein was transcribed and translated in vitro from this plasmid in the sense orientation , resulting in the correct OTF-2 band as assessed by gel mobility shift assay ( Fig .
3A , lane 2 ) .
As a comparison , nuclear extracts from the B cell line Namalwa ( lane 1 ) gave the expected OTF-1 ( upper arrow ) and OTF-2 ( lower arrow ) shifted bands .
The recombinant OTF-2 shifted band was specific since it could be competed with an excess of wild type octamer element ( lane 3 ) but was not competed with the same molar amount of mutant octamer element ( lane 4 ) .
Protein transcribed and translated from the same plasmid , but in the antisense orientation did not result in a specific OTF-2 protein ( lane 5 ) .
This antisense protein was used as a control for the cloned OTF-2 protein in the DRA transcription experiments .
The extra bands in the sense and antisense recombinant OTF-2 lanes ( lanes 2 and 5 ; arrowheads ) are specific octamer-binding proteins produced by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( compare lanes 3 and 4 ) .
HeLa cells do not contain OTF-2 protein ( see Fig .
2B ) and were used as a source of general transcription factors .
We ( 5 ) have previously reported that HeLa extracts can only minimally support transcription from the DRA promoter .
Cloned OTF-2 protein added to HeLa nuclear extracts allows for increased DRA gene transcription ( Fig .
3B , lane 2 , left arrow ) over a control extract to which antisense OTF-2 has been added ( lane 1 ) .
The arrowhead corresponds to the 494-nucleotide internal standard .
When a plasmid containing a mutated octamer element is used as a template for transcription , OTF-2 protein in the sense or in the antisense direction has no effect ( data not shown ) .
As another control for specificity , we examined the effect of recombinant OTF-2 protein on transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter ( right arrow ) , which does not contain an octamer element in its promoter .
Recombinant OTF-2 protein in the sense or in the antisense direction had no effect on adenovirus major late promoter transcription ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Thus , OTF-2 plays a positive role in DRA gene transcription .
This effect is also dependent on an intact octamer element .
In Vivo Role of Recombinant OTF-2 Protein on DRA Gene Transcription-To further address the effect of OTF-2 protein expression on DRA gene transcription , an OTF-2 expression plasmid , pCMV5-OTF-2 ( Fig .
1B ) , was co-transfected into the human T cell line HSB or into HeLa cells along with DRA-CAT reporter plasmids pWToct or pMUToct .
HSB and HeLa cells lack endogenous OTF-2 protein and DRA expression is negligible ( 33 ) .
The reporter plasmids contain wild function , in vitro transcription from the TH2ACAT plasmid was analyzed using HeLa cell extracts depleted of octamer-binding proteins ( lanes 7 and 8 ) without ( lane 7 ) or with ( lane 8 ) added HeLa cell OBPs .
The correct TH2A run-off transcription product ( right arrow ) is indicated .
The arrowhead indicates the 494-nucleotide internal standard included in all reactions .
OTF-2 Regulates DRA Gene Transcription type or mutant octamer elements in the context of 109 bp of DRA promoter sequence ( see Fig .

As a control for the OTF-2 expression plasmid , the same expression plasmid without OTF-2 sequence was used ( pCMV5 ) .
The effect of OTF-2 protein on DRA promoter function was determined by comparing the levels of CAT enzyme produced by pWToct in the presence of the OTF-2 or the control CMV expression plasmids .
A representative result of the transient transfection analysis using HSB cells ( Fig .

Ethyl acetate-extracted material was separated by thin layer chromatography and subjected to autoradiography .
7681 pare lanes 2 and 1 ) .
We have repeated the experiments using HSB cells 4 times and we have consistently observed a 2-3-fold induction of CAT expression by OTF-2 .
To determine if the effect of OTF-2 is dependent on the octamer element , a reporter plasmid containing a mutant octamer element , pMUToct , was used for similar experiments ( Fig .
4 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
OTF-2 had little effect on CAT expression from the pMUToct plasmid , demonstrating that OTF-2 induction of DRA-CAT expression requires an intact octamer element .
This effect was also observed when the similar experiment was performed using HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Transcriptional regulation is an important mechanism for the control of class II MHC gene expression .
Several cis-acting elements in the promoters of MHC class II genes have been defined that mediate this transcriptional control .
The octamer element , ATTTGCAT , is one of the cis elements defined that is necessary for DRA gene transcription in B cells , but not in non-B cells that express class II molecules ( 6 ) .
This conclusion was reached because mutagenesis of the octamer element in DRA greatly diminished gene expression in B cell lines but not in DR* non-B cell lines .
We had previously demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that two proteins bind to the DRA octamer element , one B cell-specific and the other not ( 33 ) .
These were thought to be the octamer-binding proteins OTF-2 and OTF-1 , respectively .
Although both OTF-2 and OTF-1 were capable of binding to the DRA promoter in vitro , it was not known whether these octamer-binding proteins functionally contributed to DRA gene transcription .
In this report , we demonstrated the role of OTF-2 protein in DRA gene transcription .
OTF-2 protein function was assessed in both a cell-free in vitro transcription system and by in vivo transient transfection studies .
Similar conclusions were obtained using both of these approaches .
Octamer-binding proteins enriched from B cells which contain OTF-2 could partially restore octamer-depleted DRA transcription in vitro , whereas those from HeLa cells which do not contain OTF-2 protein had no effect ( Fig .
2 ) .
Furthermore , recombinant human OTF-2 protein could potentiate DRA gene transcription , but to a lesser extent than enriched cellular OTF-2 ( Fig .
3 ) .
This result is consistent with data from other laboratories that suggests a role for an additional B cell factor in Ig gene regulation ( 28-30 ) .
Perhaps this same or another B cell factor is also required for optimal MHC DRA gene transcription .
Our in vivo studies demonstrated that OTF-2 protein enhanced DRA gene transcription 2-3-fold , and that this effect requires an intact octamer element ( Fig .
4 ) .
Together these results demonstrate a role for the OTF-2 protein in DRA gene transcription .
Although the effect of OTF-2 did not seem very dramatic , contributing about 2-3-fold enhancement of DRA transcription , it was very reproducible and the extent of OTF-2 contribution was similar using two very different methods , i.e .
in vitro cell-free transcription and in vivo transient transfection .
This level of effect was not unexpected since protein binding to the octamer element was thought to act in concert with DNA-protein interactions at other known regulatory elements of the DRA gene , including the W , X , and Y elements ( 4 ) .
We have already previously demonstrated a positive functional role for one Y element-binding protein YEBP , in DRA gene transcription in B cells ( 39 ) .
It will be informative to study the effects of all of the MHC class II promoter-binding proteins individually as well as in combination with each other to discern their roles in transcription .
In our studies , the OTF-1 enriched preparation did not 7682 affect DRA gene transcription ( Fig .
2 ) .
This is not due to the inactivity of OTF-1 in these preparations because it enhanced transcription of the control TH2A promoter .
At first glance , this seems to be in contrast to other studies where either OTF-1 or OTF-2 could positively regulate expression of the B cell-specific Ig gene ( 28-30 , 45 ) .
Octamer-enriched extracts used for our reconstitution experiments contained similar levels of OTF-1 binding activity ; therefore the differential ability of these two fractions to affect DRA gene transcription could not be due simply to differences in the amounts of octamer-binding proteins added .
It is more likely that since the context of the octamer element in the DRA promoter is different from that in the Ig promoter , the proteins that bind to this element function differently in the two genes .
Additionally , since octamer-enriched fractions from B cells were able to potentiate DRA gene transcription more than recombinant OTF-2 protein alone , another factor , potentially an additional B cell-specific factor similar to the one that acts in conjunction with OTF-2 in Ig transcription ( 29 , 30 ) , is also required for optimal MHC class II DRA gene transcription .
Although the octamer element and the OTF-2 protein play a role in MHC class II DRA gene transcription , other human MHC class II genes do not contain an obvious octamer element in their promoters .
Interestingly , the DRA homo-logues in other primates , including old and new world mon-keys , also contain octamer elements in similar locations in their promoter regions ( 46 ) .
Whether this suggests that the octamer-binding protein OTF-2 only affects transcription of the DRA gene ( and potentially its primate homologues ) but not other MHC class II genes , or whether the octamer-binding protein can bind to other DNA sequences in the promoters of these genes remains to be determined .
The octamer-binding proteins have , however , been shown to bind to DNA sequences other than the canonical ATTTGCAT octamer element including the TAATGARAT ( R = purine ) sequence upstream of the herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes ( 47 ) , the AAGAATAAATTAGA site in the Ay-globin gene promoter ( 48 ) , and the heptamer element CTCATGA in the Ig heavy chain promoter ( 49 , 50 ) .
On the other hand , if OTF-2 is only able to regulate transcription from the DRA MHC class II promoter , this could explain a possible mechanism for the higher levels of DR protein relative to DP or DQ proteins that are normally found on class II expressing cells ( 51 ) .
In conclusion , this is the first demonstration that the lymphoid-specific octamer-binding protein , OTF-2 , can positively regulate expression of the MHC class II gene , DRA .
Using both affinity-enriched protein fractions and in vitro translated OTF-2 protein in an in vitro transcription system , in addition to an in vivo approach , our results established a role for OTF-2 in DRA transcription .
Experiments are ongoing to determine the role of other proteins which may interact with OTF-2 in DRA gene expression .
