From there these immature cells migrate to the spleen where they differentiate to mature cells .
This final maturation step is crucial for the B cells to become responsive to antigens and to participate in the immune response .
Recently , invariant chain ( i ) , a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone , as well as the transcription factors c-Rel and p65/RelIA , were found to play a role in the final antigen-independent differentiation stage of B cells in the spleen .
In this study , we investigated a possible link between Ii-dependent B cell maturation and the NF- « B pathway .
Our studies indicate that Ii-induced B cell maturation involves activation of transcription mediated by the NF- « B p65/ReIA homodimer and requires the B cell-enriched coactivator TBP -associated factor 105 .
In the bone marrow , B cell development can be divided into different stages , based on the rearrangement status of the IgH and IgL chain loci ( 1 , 2 ) and the expression of intracellular and surface-bound markers .
The first cells expressing IgM during this developmental process are the immature B cells .
At this stage in their development the B cells translocate from the bone marrow to the spleen ( 3 , 4 ) .
In the spleen , B cells are still immature and are distinguishable from their mature counterparts ( 3 , 5-7 ) .
The subsequent differentiation event leads to mature B cells and is characterized by a series of changes in surface marker expression and in the activities of these cells .
Only 5 to 10 % of the newly generated immature B cells are selected into the pool of long-lived antigen-responsive mature B cells ( 7 , 8 ) .
The molecular mechanisms controlling the selection of immature B cells and especially their differentiation in the spleen are largely unknown .
The process of B cell development is controlled by a set of transcription factors , as well as stage- and lineage-restricted * This research was supported in part by Minerva Foundation , Ger-many , The Israel Science Foundation founded by the Academy of Sciences and Humanities , and the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development ( to I .

Recently several studies implicated NF- « B as a major regulator of the final stage of B cell maturation .
Cells deficient in the NF- « B family members , c-Rel and RelA , were found to be arrested at the immature stage ( 9 ) , indicating that these factors are essential for antigen-independent B cell development in the spleen .
In addition , I « Ba overexpression in B cells inhibited the formation of a mature B cell population ( 10 ) , supporting the notion that NF-kB has an essential role in late B cell differentiation .
We have shown that invariant chain ( Ii ) ,1 a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone , plays a crucial role in the differentiation of immature B cells in the spleen ( 11 ) .
In mice lacking Ii , the development from immature to mature B cells is impaired , and B cells are arrested at an immature stage characterized by low expression levels of IgD and CD23 and poor response to T-independent antigens ( 11-13 ) .
Recently we succeeded in disengaging the chaperonin activity of Ii from its role in B cell maturation and demonstrated that Ii N-terminal domain is directly involved in the maturation of B cells . ''
However , at present , the molecular mechanism by which Ii induces B cell maturation is still unknown .
Because B cells that are deficient in either Ii or NF- « B family members , c-Rel and RelA , are both arrested at the immature stage in the spleen , in this study , we investigated a possible link between Ti-induced maturation and NF- « B .
Indeed , our results indicate that Ii induces maturation by activating a pathway leading to up-regulation of transcription mediated by the p65 component of NF-kB and its coactivator , MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells Spleen cells were obtained from the various mice at 6-8 weeks of age as described previously ( 15 ) .
B cell population was enriched by treating the splenocyte suspension with antibodies against T cell surface molecules ( anti-Thy 1.2 , CD4 , and CD8 ; Southern Biotechnology Associates , Inc. ) for 1 h followed by incubation with low Tox-M complement ( Cederlane ) for 1 h at 87 °C .
Cell Transfection Primary B Cells-The method used was adapted from a procedure described previously ( 16 ) .
Purified Ii_~ B cells were incubated with 50 ug/ml lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella typhosa ( Sigma ) .
After 48 h , the cells were washed with RPMI medium and transfected with Trans-Fast transfection reagent ( Promega ) using 12 pl/4 ug of DNA ( 2 ug of pBabe-puro Ii construct + 2 ug of empty vector or 4 ug of empty vector ) according to the manufacturer 's directions .
The cells were collected after 48 h and analyzed for their cell surface marker expression by FACS analysis .
I « B , p65 , and p50 constructs were described previously ( 21 , 22 ) .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 7 Spleen B cells from mice are arrested at the immature stage .
We have developed an in vitro system to Invariant Chain-induced B Cell Maturation Involves NF- « B-TAF ; ; 105 analyze B cell maturation .
In this assay primary immature B cells from Ti-deficient mice can differentiate to mature cells in culture , by introducing Ii expression plasmid ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .2 To investigate the involvement of NF- « B in Ii-induced B cell maturation , we cotransfected an undegradable mutant form of IB , an inhibitor of NF- « B , along with p31 Ii .
In addition we introduced the 1-82 Ii fragment ( Ii1-82 ) lacking its lumenal domain .
This IxB mutant abolished both p31- and Ii1-82-mediated maturation ( Fig .
1B ) .
As p65/ReIA is a direct target for inhibition by and is also associated with the process of B cell maturation , it is plausible that NF- « B p65/ReIA is a downstream effector of Ti-induced maturation .
If so overexpression of p65/RelA should induce maturation of Ii~'~ primary immature B cells .
Indeed , p65/RelIA overcame the developmental arrest of the Ii~'~ B cells and directly induced maturation , and its effect was abolished by dominant IB ( Fig .
1C ) .
To characterize the specificity of NF- « B dimers in inducing maturation of Ii-deficient primary B cells , we analyzed maturation induction by p50-p65 dimer .
In contrast to the p65 : p65 complex , the heterodimeric complex , p65- : p50 , was unable to induce differentiation of B cells ( Fig .
1D ) .
To address the mechanism by which Ii induces B cell maturation via NF-kB , we examined the effect of Ii expression on NF- « B transcription activity .
For these studies we used human 293 cells that do not express the endogenous Ii gene .
The use of non-B cells for studies of B cell-specific transcription has been shown in many studies to provide valuable functional information for transcription factors and transcription modulators ( 19 ) .
A luciferase reporter plasmid containing two tandem NF- « B sites and a minimal core promoter was transfected , along with the expression plasmid for Ii , and luciferase activity was measured 24 h later .
As a control NF- « B-mutated or AP-1-dependent reporter plasmids were similarly analyzed .
Microscopic examination showed li-transfected cells to have the same healthy morphology as untransfected cells .
As shown in Fig .
2A Ii enhanced the constitutive NF- « B-dependent activity in a dose-dependent manner ( columns 1-3 ) .
The NF- « B-mutated reporter displayed negligible activity and was not affected by Ii expression ( columns 4-6 ) .
The AP-1-dependent reporter gene was not affected by Ii expression ( columns 7-9 ) confirming the specificity of the effect of Ii on NF-kB .
As the N-terminal segment of Ii ( p31 1-82 ) is capable of promoting B cell maturation similar to the wild type protein , we next analyzed the effect of this mutant on NF- « B transcription activity .
As can be seen in Fig .
2B , amino acids 1-82 enhanced the constitutive NF- « B-dependent activity to the same extent as the full-length protein .
Moreover , a construct of Ii lacking part of its cytosolic domain , amino acids 2-17 ( A 2-17 ) , was unable to enhance this activity ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , Ii N-terminal 17 amino acids are important for induction of NF- « B transcription activity .
A major pathway for NF- « B activation involves induction of its nuclear localization .
To determine whether Ii expression affects this process , nuclear extracts were prepared from 293 cells transfected with either empty or invariant chain expression plasmids ( efficiency of transfection was above 80 % ) .
These extracts were used in electrophoresis mobility shift assay with an NF- « B-specific probe .
Similar levels of nuclear NF- « B DNA binding activity were found in control or Ti-expressing cells , indicating that Ii does not induce nuclear transport of NF- « B ( Fig .
2C ) .
The observed DNA binding activity is NF- « B-specific as incubation of these extracts with antibodies against the p65/ReIA component of NF- « B resulted in a supershifted complex ( data not shown ) .
Thus , Ii stimulates transcription activity of NF- « B through a pathway that is independent of NF- « B nuclear transport .

Stimulation of NF- « B-dependent transcription by Ii .
A , wild type ( w.. ) and mutated NF-xB reporter plasmids containing two NF- « B-binding sites and AP-1 reporter plasmid were transfected into human 298 cells , together with either empty expression vector or with increasing amounts of Ii expression vector ( 0.5 and 1 ug ) .
Luciferase activity was measured , and the activity of the reporter alone was normalized to 1 .
B , wild type NF- « B reporter plasmids containing two NF- « B-binding sites were transfected into human 298 cells , together with either empty expression vector or with Ii p31 or 111-82 amino acids or Ii A 2-17 expression vector ( 1 ug ) .
The expression of different Ii-derived proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( lower panel ) using IN1 antibody for full-length ( FL ) and 1-82 and anti-CD74 ( San-ta Cruz Biotechnology ) for A2-17 .
C , 298 cells were transfected with either empty vector or Ii expression plasmid , and nuclear extracts were prepared .
Transfection efficiency was above 80 % as deter- c mined by cotransfected green fluorescent protein plasmid .
The extracts were subjected to electrophoresis mobility shift assay using an NF-kB-specific probe .
D , 298 cells were transfected with the luciferease reporter plasmid containing five Gal4 binding sites , together with unsaturated amounts of G4-p65 TAl ( the TAl activation domain of p65/Re ! A fused to the GAL4 G4-E2A-AD2 DNA binding domain or in the presence or absence of Ii expression plasmid ( 1 ug ) .
Luciferase units were measured , and transcriptional activity of G4-p65 TAl and G4-E2A-AD2 were normalized to 1 .
The results shown represent the average of at least four independent experiments with similar results .
Activation fold 0 we examined whether the effect of Ii is directed to the transcriptional activation function of p65/RelA .
For this purpose we used an expression plasmid that encodes a fusion of the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65/ReIA ( TAl ) with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 .
As a control , the E2A activation domain fused to Gal4 was used .
These plasmids were transfected into 293 cells , along with a luciferase reporter containing upstream Gal4-binding sites in the presence or absence of Ii plasmid .
As shown in Fig .
2D , Ii strongly and specifically stimulated the activity of the Gal4p65 but not Gal4E2A fusion proteins .
These results indicate that the effect of Ii on NF- « B activity is at least in part targeted to the activation function of p65/ReIA .
TAF ; jf105 is a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID , which is enriched in B cells ( 20 ) .
TAF ; { 105 appears to be present only in a subset of TFIID complexes and therefore is likely to function in the context of specific genes .
was shown to act as an activation domain-specific coactivator of p65/ReIA homodimers .
This function of involves its direct interaction with the p65/RelIA activation domain ( 21 , 22 ) .
To examine whether TAFL,105 is also involved in B cell differ-entiation , we employed two dominant negative forms of TAF j ; 105 lacking the TFIID interaction region in the Ti-mediated B cell maturation assay .
TAF f105ACA 452-472 is a double mutant of that is unable to bind p65/ RelA see Ref .

Apparently , suppression of the endogenous TAF ; ; 105 activity by the competing dominant negative TAF ; ,105AC prevented the maturation process .
By contrast , cotransfection of TAFq105AC-ANF- « B with p31 Ii did not interfere with the maturation process ( Fig .
3A ) .
This result further supports the involvement of p65/ReIA and the NF- « B pathway in Ti-induced B cell maturation .
Next , we analyzed the effect of TAFp105AC on Ti-induced NF- « B transcriptional activity using a luciferase reporter assay .
As shown in Fig .
3B Ti-enhanced NF- « B-dependent activity was dramatically inhibited when cotransfected with TAF 105AC .
In contrast , impaired in NF- « B binding ( TAF ; , ; 105AC-ANF- « B ) did not interfere with the Ti-induced activity .
Together , these results strongly suggest that NF- « B and are directly involved in li-mediated B cell maturation .
The role of Ii as a chaperone for major histocompatibility complex class II molecules has been well characterized .
Recently , we have described a novel role for Ii .
In mice lacking this chain , B cell maturation is impaired , and their secondary lymphoid organs are enriched with immature B cells ( 11 ) .
The data presented in this study reveal that Ii is most likely a signaling molecule that regulates this maturation step by inducing a specific gene expression program .
Essential elements in this process are the p65 component of NF- « B and its coactivator a subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIID , which is highly expressed in B cells .

Ii stimulates B cell maturation through p65/ReIA and TAF , ,105 .
Transfections were performed as described for Fig .
1 .
Cells were transfected with ( A ) empty expression plasmid , p31 or Ii1-82 alone , or together with the dominant negative mutant of TAF , ,105 ( TAF ; , ,105AC ) or TAF , p105AC A 452-472 ( TAF , ,105AC-ANF- « B ) .
The cells were FACS analyzed as described for Fig .

The graph represents the results of four independent transfection experiments .
B , wild type NF- « B reporter plasmid containing two NF- « B-binding sites was transfected into human 298 cells , together with either empty expression vector or with Ii expression vector ( 1 ug ) with or without TAF , ,105AC ( 1 ug ) or TAF , ,105AC-ANF- « B ( 1 umg ) .
The graph represents the results of three independent transfection experiments .
evidence support this conclusion .
First , maturation by Ii was suppressed by NF- « B-specific inhibitors , I « B and the dominant negative mutant of TAFL,105 However , mutant TAF ; ,105AC lacking the p65 interaction domain failed to inhibit Ti-induced maturation .
Furthermore , we show that p65/ RelA could efficiently overcome the B cell maturation block of Ti-deficient B cells .
The differentiation induced by p65 is similarly inhibited by IxB and by ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , only p65p65 but not p65 : p50 NF- « B dimeric complexes have the capacity to activate the maturation process , a result consistent with the finding that TAFL,105 preferentially associates with p65/ReIA homodimer ( 21 ) .
Moreover , these findings indicate that the activity of p65p65 is not redundant with that of the p50p65 complex in the regulation of Invariant Chain-induced B Cell Maturation Involves NF- « B-TAF ; ; 105 this stage of B cell differentiation .
In conclusion , a transcription complex of p65-p65 and is an essential downstream component of a signaling pathway stimulated by Ii that leads to specific gene activation .
NF- « B is a family of transcription factors that is activated by a broad range of extracellular signals .
A major pathway in regulating NF-kB activity involves its nuclear transport ( 23 ) .
Several studies have characterized additional pathways for inducing the activation potential of the p65 subunit of NF- « B .
The activation domain of this molecule was shown to be affected by several signaling pathways including cAMP-depend-ent protein kinase ( 24 ) , protein kinase C ( 25 ) , Ras ( 25-27 ) , and the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and Erk ( 14 ) .
These signaling pathways enhance the activation function of p65 .
Our experiments show that one possible pathway utilized by Ii involves modulation of the p65/ReIA activation domain .
We speculate that this event augments the interaction of p65 with coactivator molecules such as TAF ; ; 105 , resulting in activation of specific genes required for B cell maturation .
We suggest that Ii initiates a signaling cascade that is transmitted to the nucleus and activates protein kinases leading to modulation of either the p65 activation domain or its coactivators .
The role of p65/ReIA in the transition from immature to mature B cells in the spleen is consistent with recent studies showing that c-Rel and RelA play a crucial role in the final stages of B cell development ( 9 ) .
In that study c-Rel and RelA double deficient B cells , like Ti-deficient cells ( 11-13 ) were arrested at the immature stage .
The nature of the Ii signal essential for the maturation , as well as the pathway by which the Ii signal is transmitted to the nucleus , is still open to questions .
