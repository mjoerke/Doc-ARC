The mechanisms by which these promoters of cell growth exert their inhibitory effects vary , but in most instances they involve a disruption of the IFN- « @ /f-induced transcription complex ISGF3 such that the DNA-binding component of this complex ( the 48-kDa ISGF3y protein ) does not bind to the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) .
In this report , we demonstrate that phorbol ester treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes dramatically inhibits activation of IFN-o/f-stimulated early response genes but by a mechanism which does not involve abrogation of the ISRE binding of ISGF3y .
Phorbol ester treatment of monocytes inhibited IFNa-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factors Statla , Stat2 , and Stat3 and of the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 but had no effect on IFN-y activation of Statl « .
IFNa-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and the « subunit of the IFN-a « receptor were unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) .
Moreover , PMA caused the dephosphorylation of Tyk2 but not of Jak1 , which was activated by IFN .
Pretreatment of cells with vanadate prevented the effects of PMA with regard to PMA-induced Tyk2 dephosphorylation .
These observations suggest that PMA exerts its inhibitory effects by activation of a tyrosine phosphatase which selectively regulates Tyk2 but not Jakl activity .
Rapid activation of cellular genes by exposure of cells to interferons utilizes a signaling pathway which requires tyrosine phosphorylation of a family of transcription factors termed signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat pro-teins ) ( 15 , 20 ) .
The Janus family of tyrosine kinases are also integral components of this signaling cascade ( 15 ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins enables them to translocate to the nucleus and bind to enhancers with conserved sequences located within the promoters of responsive genes .
Two classes of enhancers which are necessary and sufficient for activation of genes by alpha/beta or gamma interferon ( IFN- « /B and IFN-y ) have been characterized .
One is termed the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) , and the other is the gamma interferon activation sequence ( GAS ) .
Either enhancer can be activated by while IFN-y-stimulated genes utilize primarily the GAS element ( 20 ) .
Tyrosine-phosphorylated Statl and Stat2 interact with the ISRE primarily through their association with ISGF3qy , a 48-kDa DNA-binding protein which is a member of the IFN regulatory factor family of DNA-binding proteins ( 32 ) .
The complex which contains these three components has been termed ISGF3 ( 21 ) .
Statl and other members of this family of transcription factors ( ex-cluding Stat ? )
interact with GAS-like sequences in the absence of ISGF3y ( 13 , 35 ) .
Inhibition of IFN-stimulated gene expression has been shown to occur under a variety of circumstances related to enhanced cellular growth and viral infection .

1419 tigen 2 inhibits the activation of IFN- « /B-stimulated genes ( 1 , 11 , 16 , 17 ) .
Many transformed cell lines also display severely diminished IFN- « /B-stimulated formation of ISGF3 and expression of ISGF3-regulated genes ( 25 ) .
Several viruses that mediate inhibition of IFN activation of cellular genes have been described ( 1 , 3 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 29 ) .
In the case of infection with vaccinia virus , a soluble IFN receptor which interferes with the actions of IFN is expressed ( 3 , 29 ) .
Expression of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 gene inhibits IFN- « -induced expression of ISRE-dependent genes but has no effect on IFN- « -induced ISGF3 formation ( 17 ) .
In several other cases thus far examined , inhibition of IFN- « /B-stimulated genes involves the expression of a cellular compet-itor ( s ) which interacts with ISGF3qy such that it can not form a stable complex with Statl and Stat2 ( 1 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 24 , 25 ) .
In fact , in several cervical cancer cell lines , the activity of this competitor , termed TKO , can be assayed in vitro by its ability to disrupt preformed ISGF3 and to bind ISGF3y directly ( 25 ) .
Phorbol ester treatment of primary human fibroblasts results in inhibition of IFN- « -induced gene expression by disrupting the ISGF3y-Stat protein interactions ( 24 ) .
Because the inhibitory effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) with regard to IFN-stimulated gene expression were cell specific and were most pronounced in primary cells ( 2 ) , we decided to examine the actions of this growth promoter in primary peripheral blood monocytes .
In these cells , PMA caused dramatic inhibition of IFN- « /B-induced gene expression by selectively enhance-ing the dephosphorylation of the Tyk2 kinase .

Phorbol ester treatment of monocytes inhibits IFN- « - but not IFN-y-stimulated gene expression .
Primary peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from normal volunteers as described previously ( 35 ) and incubated with 10~® M PMA for 1 h at 37°C , at which time either IFN- « ( 10° U/ml ! )
or IFN-y ( 10 ng/ml ) was added to some of the samples for an additional 1 h. ( A ) Total cellular RNA was isolated and hybridized with antisense riboprobes corresponding to several known IFN- « -induced genes including ISG15 ( 27 ) , ISG54 ( 2 ) , IFN-2 ( 2 ) , and 9-27 ( 28 ) .

RESULTS The phorbol ester PMA inhibits IFN-a « -stimulated early response genes in peripheral blood monocytes .
Previous studies have demonstrated that in some cells , PMA treatment results in the inhibition of IFN- « -stimulated 54-kDa gene ( ISG54 ) expression ( 2 , 24 ) .
The effects of PMA were cell as well as gene specific but were most prominent in primary fibroblasts ( 2 ) .
To determine whether PMA modulated IFN- « signaling in other primary cells , we examined the actions of this growth promoter in primary human monocytes .
Monocytes are very sensitive to the effects of phorbol esters in that they promote cell attachment and phagocytosis , both of which may modulate the actions of IFNs .
RNA was prepared from monocytes which had been left untreated or were treated with PMA in the presence or absence of IFN- « , and the induction of several IFN- « -induced RNAs was analyzed by RNase protection assays ( Fig .
Vou .
16 , 1996 1A ) .
In contrast to primary human fibroblasts , in which PMA treatment of cells inhibited ISG54 but not ISG15 RNA ( 24 ) , in primary human monocytes , PMA inhibited IFN-e-stimulated expression of several IFN- « -induced RNAs including ISG54 , ISG15 , 9-27 , and IFN-2 .
However , under the same conditions , IFN-y-stimulated expression of FeyR1 RNA was unaffected , suggesting that the effects of PMA were specific for the IFN « /B signaling cascade ( Fig .
1B ) .
To determine whether PMA treatment of monocytes was affecting IFN-o « -stimulated transcription of these early response genes rather than modifying the RNA half-life , nuclear run-on assays were performed ( Fig .
1C ) .
Monocytes were incubated with PMA for 1 h prior to the addition of IFN- « for another 45 min .
Nuclei were isolated and incubated in the presence of [ « - '' P ] JUTP , and isolated nuclear RNA was hybridized to nitrocellulose filters containing the indicated cDNA probes .
The intensity of the autoradiographic signal is a reflection of the transcription rate of a given gene at the time the nuclei were isolated ( 8 ) .
PMA inhibited by 80 to 90 % the transcription of all IFN- « -stimulated genes examined while the effects on actin and glyceraldehyde phosphate-3-dehydrogenase transcription were insignificant ( Fig .
1C ) .
PMA treatment of monocytes does not alter IFN- « binding to its receptor .
One possible explanation of the inhibitory actions of PMA on IFN- « activation of early response genes is that PMA treatment of monocytes decreases the number or affinity of IFN-a « cell surface receptors .
To explore this possibility , receptor-binding assays were performed with '**I-la-beled IFN- « 2b ; and the receptor number and affinity were determined by Scatchard analysis .
Peripheral blood monocytes contain approximately 625 receptors per cell with an apparent affinity of 6.2 X 10 '' ° for IFN- « 2b .
Incubation of monocytes with PMA for 60 min prior to performing the binding assay had no significant effect on either the number ( 575 ) or affinity ( 7.1 x 10 '' ) of IFN- « receptors for their ligand .
These results rule out the possibility that a simple change in IFN- « cell surface receptors can account for the inhibitory actions of PMA .
IFN-a @ -induced formation of ISGF3 and complexes that bind GAS enhancers are decreased in PMA-treated monocytes .
Five of the signaling components besides the receptor that are required for IFN- « /B activation of early response genes include the tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1 and the transcription factors Stat1 , Stat2 , and Stat3 .
Each of these proteins is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated as a result of IFN- « /B binding to its receptor .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stat proteins allows them to form dimers and translocate to the nucleus , where they bind to specific enhancers ( GAS and ISRE ) within the promoters of IFN- « /B-activated genes ( 20 ) .
While Stat1 and Stat3 bind to both GAS-like and ISRE enhancers , Stat2 binds only to the ISRE ( 20 ) .
To initially determine whether PMA inhibited IFN- « /B-stimulated binding to the GAS and ISRE enhancers , EMSAs were performed with oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the ISRE of the ISG15 gene and the GRR of the FeyR1 enhancer .
PMA treatment of monocytes prior to the addition of IFN- « clearly inhibited formation of the IFN- « -induced complex which bound to the GRR ( Fig .
2A ) and also formation of the ISGF3 transcription complex that bound to the ISRE ( Fig .
2B ) .
This finding excluded ISGF3qy as the primary target for PMA , because ISGF3y is required for the formation of ISGF3 but not for the GRR-binding complex ( 14 ) .
Interestingly , IFN-y-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl and its binding to the GRR were not affected by PMA treatment of the same monocytes ( Fig .
2A , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
IFN-a « -stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Statla , Stat2 , and Stat3 is inhibited in monocytes incubated with PMA .

Incubation of monocytes with PMA inhibits IFN- « -stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 but not of Jak1 or the a subunit of the IFN- « /f receptor ( IFNaR ) .
Peripheral blood monocytes were incubated as described in the legend to Fig .

( A and B ) The extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine antibody , and the subsequent blots were probed for the presence of either Jak1 ( A ) or Tyk2 ( B ) .

The blots were reprobed with their respective Stat-specific antisera to ensure that equal amounts of Stat protein were present in each sample ( data not shown ) .
PMA inhibits IFNa-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 but not Jak ] and the « subunit of the IFN- « @ /f receptor .
The observation that PMA inhibited IFN- « -stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Statla , Stat2 , and Stat3 suggested that it affects a signaling component ( s ) upstream of these transcription factors .
Both the Tyk2 and Jak1 tyrosine kinases are required for IFN- « -stimulated gene expression , and activation of these kinases by IFN- « treatment of cells induces their tyrosine phosphorylation ( 22 , 33 ) .
To examine whether PMA affected IFN- « -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 and Jak1 , we incubated monocytes with or without PMA for 30 min prior to the addition of IFN- « for 10 min .
Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with antiphosphotyrosine antibody .
Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE , blotted , and probed for the presence of either Tyk2 or Jakl ( Fig .
4A and B ) .
Although IFN- « -stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 was unaffected by treatment with PMA , there was virtually complete inhibition of IFN- « -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 .
Direct immunoprecipitations of Jak1 and Tyk2 followed by antiphosphotyrosine blotting revealed similar results ( data not shown ) .
The a subunit of the IFN « /B receptor has also been demonstrated to be rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated as a result of exposure of cells to IFN- « or IFN-B ( 26 ) .
Since Tyk2 but not Jak1 appeared to be a target for the PMA-induced inhibition of this signaling cascade , this observation allowed us to examine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the a subunit of the receptor paralleled the actions of PMA with regard to Tyk2 .
Monocytes were incubated with PMA ( Fig .
4A and B ) , and extracts were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the a subunit of the IFN- « /f receptor .
The subsequent blots were probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody ( Fig .
4C ) .
It is evident from these results that while IFN- « induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of this subunit of the receptor , PMA had no inhibitory effect on this event .
This finding suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of the « subunit of the receptor in primary monocytes may be more directly linked to activation of Jak ] rather than of Tyk2 .
Evidence for the role of a PMA-activated tyrosine phosphatase which targets phosphorylated Tyk2 .
From the results presented above , it appeared that PMA treatment of peripheral blood monocytes selectively inhibited IFN- « -stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 .
Two possible mechanisms could account for the actions of PMA .
Either PMA treatment of monocytes inactivates the kinase which is responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 , or PMA activates a tyrosine phosphatase ( protein tyrosine phosphatase [ PTPase ] ) which dephosphorylates this kinase .
If a tyrosine phosphatase were activated by PMA treatment of monocytes , incubation of cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate should reverse the inhibitory effects of PMA .
Monocytes were incubated for 30 min with vanadate prior to the addition of PMA for 30 min .
IFN-a « was then added to the cells for a further 15 min prior to the preparation of cell extracts .
EMSAs were performed with the GRR enhancer , or antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates were probed for Tyk2 ( Fig .
5 ) .
Preincubation of monocytes with vanadate prevented most of the inhibition by PMA of IFN-a-stimulated formation of the GRR-binding complex ( Fig .
5A , lanes 2 and 6 ) .
In other experiments , vanadate completely blocked the actions of PMA and also enabled Tyk2 to be tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of PMA and IFN- « ( Fig .
5B , lanes 5 , 6 , and 8 ) .
Vanadate treatment of cells in the absence of PMA or IFN- « had no effect on either formation of the GRR-binding complex ( Fig .
5A , lane 5 ) or tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 ( Fig .
5B , lane 3 ) .
If the inhibitory actions of PMA were mediated through the activation of a tyrosine phosphatase which targeted Tyk2 spe-cifically , PMA treatment of cells should also stimulate the dephosphorylation of Tyk2 that is already tyrosine phosphorylated after IFN- « treatment .
To address this possibility , we incubated monocytes with IFN- « for 10 min to allow Tyk2 to become tyrosine phosphorylated ( Fig .
5B , lane 5 ) .
PMA was then added to the cells in the continuous presence of IFN-a « for an additional 10 min prior to preparation of cell lysates .
Addition of PMA to cells which had previously been exposed to IFN- « induced the dephosphorylation of Tyk2 on tyrosine ( compare lanes 5 and 7 ) , as did the addition of PMA prior to IFN-a ( lane 6 ) .
In a separate aliquot from these samples , Tyk2 was directly immunoprecipitated and probed for Tyk2 by an immunoblot ( Fig .
5B , lower panel ) .
Equal amounts of Tyk2 protein were present in all samples , ruling out the possibility Vou .

PMA stimulates a PTPase activity in monocytes which targets Tyk2 .
( A ) Vanadate reverses PMA inhibition of IFN- « -stimulated binding to the GRR enhancer .
Monocytes were incubated with 1 mM vanadate at 22°C ( lanes 5 through 8 ) for 30 min .
PMA ( lanes 3 , 4 , 6 , and 7 ) was then added to some samples , and all samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. IFN- « ( lanes 2 , 3 , 6 , and 8 ) was then added for 15 min , cell extracts were prepared , and EMSAs were performed with the GRR oligonucleotide probe as described in the legend to Fig .
2 .
( B ) Vanadate reverses PMA inhibition of IFN-a-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 , and PMA stimulates the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyk2 .
Monocytes were incubated with vanadate , PMA , and/or IFN- « as in panel A .
The incubation time with IFN- « was 20 min .
In lane 7 , PMA was added to the culture 10 min after IFN- « and the incubation with both reagents was continued for an additional 10 min .
After the indicated treatments , cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine antibody ( « -PY ) .
The resulting blot was probed with Tyk2 monoclonal antibody as in Fig .
4B .
In the lower part of panel B , separate aliquots were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyk2 antiserum and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE .
The resulting blot was probed for the presence of Tyk2 by using a Tyk2 monoclonal antibody ( Transduction Labs ) .
that incubation of monocytes with PMA induced a selective degradation of the protein .
Rather , these results indicate that PMA is activating a tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates Tyk2 such that the Stat proteins can not be activated and transcription of IFN- « -stimulated early response genes is blocked .
DISCUSSION Modulation of growth factor and cytokine-regulated signaling cascades by viruses and oncogenic proteins is a well-known phenomenon .
For IFN- « or IFN-B activation of early response genes , a common control point used by adenovirus E1A , HPV E6/7 , or phorbol esters is the disruption of the interaction of the 48-kDa ISRE-binding protein , ISGF3y , with activated Stat transcription factors ( 1 , 11 , 16 ) .
The results of these studies clearly indicate that phorbol ester treatment of primary human peripheral blood monocytes selectively inhibits IFN- « /B activation of the Jak/Stat pathway .
In contrast to the other mech-anisms , PMA exerts its inhibitory effects in monocytes by inducing a tyrosine phosphatase activity that targets Tyk2 but has no effects on IFN- « -stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of either Jak ] or the a subunit of the IFN- « /B receptor .
There is recent evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 by IFN- « treatment of cells is not required for some aspects of IFN -a signaling ( 34 ) .
That study showed that a kinase-inactive Tyk2 transfected into a cell line lacking Tyk2 could rescue cell growth under selective pressure , presumably via an ISGF3-independent pathway .
However , IFN-a « treatment of cells expressing the kinase-inactive Tyk2 failed to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl and Stat2 ( 34 ) .
These results are in agreement with those presented here , in which tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 occurs in parallel with IFN- « -induced expression of early response genes and tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stat proteins .
The mechanisms by which PMA inhibits IFN- « -induced gene expression by stimulating a PTPase activity which dephosphorylates Tyk2 are unresolved .
Presumably , either the PTPase or a PMA-activated kinase which regulates the PTPase activity is very cell specific , since the dramatic inhibitory actions of this tumor promoter are restricted to primary monocytes and have thus far not been observed in any cell lines of monocytic origin .
Although it is still unclear whether PMA is exerting its actions by stimulating a protein kinase C isoform , we have observed that the protein kinase C inhibitor bisin-dolylmaleimide reverses the effects of PMA ( data not shown ) , a finding which is consistent with this possibility .
Previous studies have implicated the role of tyrosine phosphatases as both positive ( 6 , 12 , 30 ) and negative ( 4 , 13 ) regulators of IFN- « / B-stimulated activation of the Jak/Stat pathway .
However , the PMA-stimulated PTPase activity described here appears to be unique .
Although PTPases are clearly important modulators of cell growth and growth factor-mediated signaling cascades , few instances in which the activities of PTPases are known to be selective have been described .
One such PTPase is the SHZ domain-containing PTPase , PTP1C .
This PTPase has recently been implicated in down regulation of both erythropoietin and IFN- « activation of Jak2 and Jak1 , respectively ( 4 , 18 ) .
Its activity has been shown to be enhanced by treatment of HL60 cells with phorbol esters ( 36 ) .
PTP1C therefore seemed to be one candidate for a PMA-stimulated PTPase which could inhibit IFN- « /B-stimulated Tyk2 activity in primary monocytes .
However , in the studies examining the role of PTP1C in IFN « /B activation of the Jak/Stat pathway , it appears that this PTPase seems to selectively inactivate Jak1 , with only modest or no effects on IFN- « /B-stimulated Tyk2 tyrosine phosphor 1424 PETRICOIN ET AL .
ylation ( 4 ) .
In addition , experiments with macrophages from motheaten mice , which do not express PTP1C , indicate that PMA still is able to inhibit IFN- « /B stimulation of the Stat activation in the absence of PTP1C ( data not shown ) .
Three other PTPases which are regulated by serine phosphorylation and/or PMA treatment of cells include PTP1D , PTP-PEST , and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase « ( RPTPa ) ( 7 , 10 , 23 ) .
The first two PTPases are inactivated by PMA treatment of cells , whereas the third ( RPTPa ) is widely expressed and PMA augments its activity in several cell types ( 7 ) .
However , since its expression is ubiquitous , RPTPa remains a possible but relatively unlikely candidate to stimulate selective dephosphorylation of Tyk2 in monocytes .
Therefore , the identity of the PTPase that is being regulated by PMA in these cells and the mechanism by which this PTPase displays substrate specificity for Tyk2 remain to be determined .
