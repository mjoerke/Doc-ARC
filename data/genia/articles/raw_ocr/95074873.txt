1 Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Protein 2 Transactivation of the Latent Membrane Protein 1 Promoter Is Mediated by Jk and PU.1 ERIC JOHANNSEN , EUGENE KOH , GEORGE MOSIALOS , XIAO TONG , ELLIOTT KIEFF , * AND STEVEN R. GROSSMAN Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , Program in Virology , and Department of Medicine , Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Received 22 August 1994/Accepted 23 September 1994 Expression of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP-1 ) oncogene is regulated by the EBV nuclear protein 2 ( EBNA-2 ) transactivator .
EBNA-2 is known to interact with the cellular DNA-binding protein Jx and is recruited to promoters containing the GTGGGAA Jx recognition sequence .
The minimal EBNA-2-responsive LMP-1 promoter includes one Jx-binding site , and we now show that mutation of that site , such that Jr can not bind , reduces EBNA-2 responsiveness by 60 % .
To identify other factors which interact with the LMP-1 EBNA-2 response element ( E2RE ) , a -236/-145 minimal E2RE was used as a probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
The previously characterized factors Jx , PU.1 , and AML1 bind to the LMP-1 E2RE , along with six other unidentified factors ( LBF2 to LBF7 ) .
Binding sites were mapped for each factor .
LBF4 is B- and T-cell specific and recognizes the PU.1 GGAA core sequence as shown by methylation interference .
LBF4 has a molecular mass of 105 kDa and is probably unrelated to PU.1 .
LBF2 was found only in epithelial cell lines , whereas LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , and LBF7 were not cell type specific .
Mutations of the AML1- or LBF4-binding sites had no effect on EBNA-2 transactivation , whereas mutation of the PU.1-binding site completely eliminated EBNA-2 responses .
A gst-EBNA-2 fusion protein specifically depleted PU.1 from nuclear extracts and bound in vitro translated PU.1 , providing biochemical evidence for a direct EBNA-2-PU.1 interaction .
Thus , EBNA-2 transactivation of the LMP-1 promoter is dependent on interaction with at least two distinct sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins , Jx and PU.1 .
LBF3 , LBFS5 , LBF6 , or LBF7 may also be involved , since their binding sites also contribute to EBNA-2 responsiveness .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear protein 2 ( EBNA-2 ) regulates virus and cell gene transcription and is essential for primary B-lymphocyte growth transformation ( 8 , 18 ) .
One critical EBNA-2 function is to regulate transcription of the EBV latent membrane protein 1 oncogene ( LMP-1 ) ( 1 , 44 ) , whose expression is also essential for primary B-lymphocyte growth transformation ( 21 ) .
EBNA-2 response elements ( EZREs ) have been characterized upstream of the EBV LMP -1 , LMP -2A , and Cp promoters ( 12 , 20 , 41 , 51 ) , as well as the CD23 promoter ( 45 ) .
Each E2RE includes MNYYGTGG GAA , which includes the cognate sequence for the cellular DNA-binding protein Jx ( 16 , 42 ) .
Jx interacts with EBNA-2 in vitro ( 16 , 19 ) and in vivo ( 48 ) and thus can recruit EBNA-2 to E2REs .
While lacking direct sequence-specific DNA-binding activity , EBNA-2 has an acidic activator domain that can interact with TFIIB and TAF40 and increase transcription from heterologous promoters ( 7 , 40 ) .
However , E2REs are more complex than expected from a simple model whereby only Jx cognate sequences are necessary to direct EBNA-2-responsive promoters .
Jk is ubiquitously expressed in cell lines and tissues ( 14 , 16 , 17 , 38 ) , but the LMP-1 E2RE is responsive in B cells but not T or epithelial cells ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , the LMP LMP-2 , Cp , and CD23 minimal E2REs all include one or two Jx sites but can not be limited to those sites and still maintain EBNA-2 responsiveness ( 12 , 20 , 41 , 46 , 51 ) .
Moreover , reporter constructs containing four tandem Jx sites or two tandem Cp EZREs were * Corresponding author .

253 not EBNA-2 responsive , although higher-order oligomers did exhibit E2RE activity ( 25 ) .
The promoter-distal end of the LMP-1 EZ2RE has been mapped to either -234 bp ( 41 ) or -214 bp ( 12 ) relative to the mRNA cap site .
The two likely LMP-1 E2RE Jx-binding sites are at -298 to -290 or -223 to -213 .
One of these sites lies within a -234 EZRE , and neither is within a -214 E2RE .
The promoter-proximal end of the LMP1 E2RE has been defined to be -145 ( 12 ) or -92 ( 41 ) .
The objectives of these experiments are to more precisely define the role of Jx in the LMP-1 E2RE and to identify other cellular factors that may be involved .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture .
Cell lines were maintained in either RPMI 1640 ( B- and T-cell lines ) or Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium DMEM ( 293 and HeLa cell lines ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
Plasmids .
Plasmids p-512/LMP , p-205/LMP , p-147/LMP , and p-55/LMP , which contain inserts beginning at the indicated upstream positions ( relative to the mRNA cap site ) of the B95-8 LMP-1 gene cloned into the BamHI site of the promoterless reporter plasmid pCAT3M , have been described previously ( 24 ) .
p-236/LMP and p-215/LMP were constructed by PCR amplification of the LMP-1 upstream region with the 3 ' ( +39 ) LMP primer ( CCGGATCCCAGG GCAGTGTGTCAGG ) and either the -236 ( GCGGATCCTTGGCCACCGCA TTCCCA ) or -215 ( CCGGATCCGCTTGCCCCCCGGGGACC ) 5 ' primer .
Plasmid p-236AJx contained a -236/LMP insert mutated at nucleotides -219 to -217 ( CAC-AGA ) cloned into the BamHI site in pCAT3M .
The 5'-mutated primer ( -236AJx ) used in the PCR was GCGGATCCTTGGCCACCGCATTC-CAGAAGCTTGCCCC .
Plasmid p-236ALBF1 was constructed in a similar fashion with a CAC-ACA mutation at positions -230 to -228 , using the 5 ' -236ALBF1 primer , GCGGATCCTTGGCACACGCATTCCCA .
Plasmid p-236 APU.1 was constructed by using overlapping primers ( GTAGAAAGGGTCCG TAGAAAGCG and CGCTTTCTACGGACCCTTTCTAC ) to generate overlapping products mutated at nucleotides -166 to -164 ( TTC-GGA ) , which were then extended with the -236 and LMP primers and cloned into the BamHI site of pCAT3M .
Plasmid p-215APU.1 was constructed in a similar manner to 254 JOHANNSEN ET AL .
p-236APU.1 , except that the -215 primer was used as the 5 ' primer in the second PCR step .
Plasmids pTK-236/-145 , pTK-215/-145 , pTK-236/-196 , pTK-215/-174 , and pTK-187/-145 contain inserts from the indicated upstream positions of the B95-8 LMP-1 gene cloned as PCR products or synthetic oligonucleotides into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2 , which contains a minimal thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene ( 27 ) .
The 5 ' primers used in these PCRs are described above ( primers -236 and -215 ) ; the 3 ' -145 primer was GCGGATCCTCTAGAATGTAAGCGTAGAAG GGG .
Plasmids pTK-236AJx , pTK-236ALBF1 , pTK-236APU.1 , and pTK-215 APU.1 contain the above-described mutations within the -236/-145 insert that was PCR amplified with the above-described mutant 5° primers and cloned into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2 .
The 3 ' primer for these products was the -145 primer except for pTK-236APU.1 and pTK-215APU.1 , for which it was GCGGATCC TCTAGAATGTAAGCGTAGAAAGGGTCCGTAGAAAGCG .
Plasmid pTK-236ALBF4 contains a heptanucleotide mutation ( GCTTTCT-TAGG GAG ) at positions -175 to -169 within the -236 to -145 insert and was PCR amplified with the -236 and the LBF4A ( GCGGATCCATGTAAGCGTAG AAAGGGGAAGTCTCCCTAGTGTGTITGT ) primers before being cloned into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2 .
All LMP-1 promoter constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing .
Nuclear extracts and EMSA .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified Dignam method as previously described ( 48 ) .
Probes were prepared from annealed synthetic oligonucleotides or from the 92-bp BemHI inserts in pTK-236 or pTK-236APU.1 .
Plasmids were digested with BamHI , and GATC overhangs were filled in with Klenow by using a [ °°P ] JGTP .
For electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) 5 g of nuclear extract was incubated for 5 min at room temperature in reaction buffer [ 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-NV'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ; pH 7.9 ) , 5 % glycerol , 0.5 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 125 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 100 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml , 40 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) per ml , 50 mM KCI with or without a 100-fold molar excess of specific competitor oligonucleotide .
Probe was then added to the reaction mixture ( 1 to 2 ng or 5 X 10° to 10 x 10° cpm per reaction } , which was incubated for 15 min at room temperature .
For supershift assays , antibody was preincubated with nuclear extract in reaction buffer on ice for 10 min .
Samples were electrophoresed on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA ( TBE ) , after which the gel was dried and exposed to film .
PU.1 and AML1 antibodies were described previously ( 30 , 35 ) .
Protein purification .
Louckes or IB4 nuclear extracts from 18 liters of cells were diluted with 4 volumes of 20 mM morpholineethanesulfonic acid ( MES ; pH 6.2 ) -2 mM dithiothreitol-1 mM EDTA-10 % glycerol-0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-10 pg of aprotinin per ml , loaded onto an S-Sepharose column , and step eluted with 100 to 1,000 mM NaCl .
For LBF4 purification , peak fractions for LBF4 EMSA activity after S-Sepharose were pooled and fractionated on DNA cellulose ; then peak DNA cellulose fractions ( 0.3 M NaCl ) were subjected to sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography with multimerized -176 to -151 oligonucleotide as described previously ( 16 ) .
CAT assays .
BJAB cells ( 10 ' ) were electroporated ( Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ) with 5 wg of pUC-B-galactosidase , 5 to 15 ug of pSGS or pSGS-EBNA-2 , and 5 g of CAT reporter plasmid .
Cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 with 10 % fetal calf serum for 48 h ( LMP promoter assays ) or 65 h ( TK promoter assays ) .
Cell extracts were assayed for CAT and B-galactosidase activity ( 41 ) , as well as for EBNA-2 , by Western immunoblot with pE2 antibody ( 49 ) .
Methylation interference assay .
The EcoRI-Sa/l fragment from plasmid pTK-236/-145 was singly end labeled with [ °°P ] JCTP , and used for methylation interference assays of PU.1 and LBF4 complexes as described previously ( 5 ) .
Western blotting and elution from SDS-PAGE gels .
PU.1 ( 35 ) , ets ( Santa Cruz Biochemicals ) , and NFAT -p ( 29 ) antibodies used in Western blot experiments have been described previously .
LBF4 was eluted and renatured from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) gel slices as described previously ( 4 ) .
RESULTS The minimal LMP-1 E2RE requires the cooperation of at least two discrete elements .
The relative contribution of Jx to the EBNA-2 responsiveness of the LMP-1 promoter was investigated with CAT reporter constructs ( Fig .
1A ) which contained no Jk site ( -215/LMP ) , the -223 to -213 site ( -236/LMP ) , or both the -223 to -213 and -298 to -290 sites ( -512/LMP ) .
In B lymphocytes , p-236/LMP , and p-512/ LMP were equally EBNA-2 responsive ( 10- versus 8.5-fold [ Fig .
1A¥J ) .
p-215/LMP , which contains no J sites , was significantly less responsive ( 4.5-fold ) , and p-205/LMP , p-147/LMP , and p-55/LMP showed no responsiveness above that of a promoterless vector control ( Fig .
1A ) .
The activity of the -215/LMP construct was consistently higher than that of the vector control but significantly lower than that of the J. ViroL .

EBNA-2 responsiveness in the LMP-1 upstream region .
EBNA-2 induced increases in CAT activity in BJAB Burkitt 's lymphoma cells transfected with an LMP1 promoter-CAT reporter plasmid ( A ) or with an LMP1 regulatory fragment upstream of an HSV TK promoter-CAT reporter plasmid ( B ) .
CAT activity with a cotransfected EBNA-2 expression vector is compared with CAT activity with an expression vector without EBNA-2 .
CAT activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by using a cotransfected simian virus 40 carly promot-er-driven B-galactosidase expression plasmid .
Error bars indicate the standard deviation of values in independent assays .
-236/LMP construct .
These data therefore show that one Jx site is necessary for full EBNA-2 effect and confirm the previous finding that a -214/+40 LMP promoter without either Jx site is still EBNA-2 responsive ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , the data suggest that a factor interacting with sequence between -215 and -205 is essential for the residual activity of the -215/LMP construct .
To confirm the 3 ' boundary of the LMP-1 EZRE , a -236 to -145 LMP-1 upstream sequence was cloned 5 ' to the herpes simplex virus TK minimal promoter in a CAT reporter construct .
EBNA-2 induced a 4.5-fold activation of this construct ( Fig .
1B ) , which was similar to the 4-fold induction previously demonstrated for the -234 to -92 element ( 41 ) .
Also consistent with previous results ( 41 ) , a sequence containing just the Jrx-binding site ( -236 to -196 ) was not sufficient to mediate EBNA-2 responsiveness ( Fig .
1B ) .
The -215 to -174 , -187 to -145 , and -215 to -145 constructs were similarly unresponsive ( Fig .
1B ) .
Thus , EBNA-2 transactivation of the LMP1 E2RE depends on cooperation of the Jx site ( -223 to -213 ) with an element ( s ) partially or fully within the -215 to -145 sequence .
In contrast to previous experiments in which sevenfold activation was seen ( 12 ) , the -215 to -145 construct did not show a significant EBNA-2 response .
This may be explained by the lower sensitivity of the TK reporter system used in these experiments in which the larger -236 to -145 construct gave only 4.5-fold activation , as opposed to the previously reported 20-fold activation for this sequence ( 12 ) .
Nevertheless , our results with the -215/LMP native promoter Vou .

construct do confirm that LMP-1 promoter constructs without the Jr site retain residual EBNA-2 responsiveness .
The minimal LMP-1 E2RE binds multiple factors including the ets protein PU.1 .
The DNA sequence of the -236 to -145 minimal EZRE element was examined for binding sites of known transcription factors .
A perfect 6- of 6-bp match for the AML1 protein-binding site ( TGYGGT [ 30 ] ) was found between -229 and -224 , and an 11- of 12-bp match to a PU.1-binding site ( AAAGGGGAAGTa [ 22 ] ) was found at -169 to -158 ( Fig .
2A ) .
The putative AML1 site is immediately 5 '' to the consensus Jr site agctGTGGGAA ( 16 ) at -223 to -213 ( Fig .
2A ) .
AML1 is the human homolog of the mouse PEAZ factor , which is important for the activity of the poly-omavirus enhancer and is also the target of translocations in a number of human leukemias ( 2 , 11 , 31 , 34 ) .
PU.1 is an ets family protein important for the regulation of macrophage-and B-cell-specific promoters ( 22 ) .
To confirm activity for the hypothetical AML1- and PU.1-binding sites and to identify other factors that bind to the -236 EBNA-2 TRANSACTIVATION OF LMP-1 255 to -145 EZRE sequence , EMSAs were performed with B-cell extracts and a -236/-145 probe ( Fig .
2B ) .
A predominant complex and a second , less abundant complex were noted ( Fig .
2B , lane 2 ) .
Overlapping oligonucleotide competitors ( Fig .
2A ) were used to identify the binding sites of these factors .
A -168 to -145 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2A ) that contains the PU.1 site inhibited the most abundant complex ( Fig .
2B , lane 3 ) , and a -168 to -145 oligonucleotide with a mutation in the PU.1 consensus site ( Fig .
2A , -168/-145A1 ) no longer inhibited it ( Fig .
2B , lane 4 ) .
When antibody to PU.1 ( 35 ) was added to a mixture of nuclear extract and probe , the putative PU.1 complex disappeared and a larger , `` supershifted '' complex appeared , whereas control antibody had no effect ( Fig .
2B , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Addition of competitor -168 to -145 oligonucleotide specifically inhibited formation of the supershifted complex ( lane 9 ) .
Moreover , in vitro translated murine PU.1 ( which is only 2 amino acids longer than human PU.1 ) formed a complex with the -236/-145 probe which had the same mobility as the putative PU.1 complex ( Fig .
2B , compare lane 2 with lane 10 ) .
The recombinant PU.1 EMSA complex was inhibited by the -168 to -145 and -176 to -151 oligonucleotides but not by the -168 to -145A1 oligonucleotide , which is mutated within the PU.1 site ( lanes 11 to 13 ) .
These data indicate that the predominant EMSA complex observed with the -236/-145 LMP-1 probe and B-lymphoma cell extracts is due to PU.1 .
The other major -236 to -145 EMSA complex , LBF4 ( LMP binding factor 4 ) , was inhibited by a -176 to -151 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2A and 2B , lane 5 ) , which also contains the PU.1 site .
However , neither the smaller -168 to -145 PU.1 consensus site oligonucleotide nor a partially overlapping -180 to -158 oligonucleotide inhibited the LBF4 complex ( Fig .
2B , lane 3 , and data not shown ) .
Mutation of nucleotides -175 to -169 in the -176 to -151 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2A , -176/-151A1 ) partially impaired competition for LBF4 binding , but PU.1 was still inhibited effectively ( Fig .
2B , lane 6 ) .
All other mutations within this region showed similar effects on both factors ( summarized in Fig .
3A ) .
Neither PU.1 nor LBF4 bound to -236/-145 probe mutated at the PU.1 site ( see Fig .
5A , lane 2 ) .
Mutation of nucleotides -166 to -164 or -160 to -158 in the -236 to -145 fragment abolished both PU.1 and LBFA4 competitor activity ( Fig .
3A ) .
Mutations at either -162 to -161 or -157 to -151 within the -176 to -151 oligonucleotide had no effect on PU.1 or LBF4 binding ( Fig .
3A ) .
On the basis of these data with wild-type or mutated oligonucleotide competitors , LBF4 must bind to a sequence which includes the PU.1 consensus site and additional 5 '' sequence that is not essential for PU.1 binding ( Fig .
3A ) .
To further differentiate PU.1- and LBF4-binding sequences , guanosine contacts were evaluated by methylation interference .
As shown in Fig .
3B , methylation of guanosines at positions -163 and -164 strongly interfered with the binding of both PU.1 and LBF4 , while methylation of guanosine at position -162 interfered less completely with the binding of both .
These interference patterns center on a GGAA core ( -159 to -162 ) which is characteristic of ets family DNA-binding sites , and the putative PU.1 methylation intereference pattern is similar to that reported previously ( 22 ) .
To determine if PU.1 is a subunit of LBF4 ( as is seen with the PU.1-NF-EMS complex [ 36 ] ) , LBFA4 was purified from IB4 cell nuclear extracts by sequential cation exchange , DNA-cellulose , and sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography , using EMSA to monitor LBF4 activity .
LBF4 eluted from S-Sepharose in 500 mM NaCl , whereas PU.1 eluted in 900 mM NaCl ( results not shown ) .
The S-Sepharose fraction was chro-matographed on a nonspecific DNA-cellulose matrix , and the 256 JOHANNSEN ET AL .

The gel was sliced into small pieces , each containing proteins of a defined size .
The proteins were eluted from each slice , renatured , and analyzed by EMSA ( 4 ) .

Determination of the size of LBF4 .
The LBF4 peak activity fraction from a sequence-specific DNA affinity column containing a multimerzied -176 to -151 oligonucleotide was fractionated on an SDS-6 % polyacrylamide gel .
( A ) A silver-stained lane of the gel .
( B ) A nonstained lane was cut into slices corresponding to different protein sizes , and eluted proteins from each slice were tested for EMSA activity with a labeled -176/-151 probe .
A sample containing the peak activity of LBF4 from an S-Sepharose column is shown in lane 13 .
The positions of LBF4 and free probe ( P ) are indicated .
ies did , however , react with the expected proteins in cell extracts and in other column fractions ( results not shown ) .
These data indicate that PU.1 and LBF4 are distinct polypeptides that interact with the same core sequence , although the LBF4-binding site is larger and includes sequence 5 ' to the PU.1 site .
A probe mutated for PU.1 and LBF4 binding allows resolution of additional LMP-1 E2RE EMSA complexes and confirmation that AML1 is LBFL .
EMSA with B-cell nuclear extract with a -236/-145 probe mutated at the PU.1- and LBF4-binding site ( -236/-145APU.1 ) allowed resolution of complexes obscured by the presence of the abundant PU.1 and LBF4 complexes .
Five novel complexes were identified with this probe and termed LBF1 , LBF3 , LBFS5 , LBF6 , and LBF7 ( Fig .
5A , lane 2 ) .
A sixth complex was identical in size to the expected Jx complex ( lane 2 ) .
Overlapping competitor oligonucleotides spanning the probe sequence were then used to map the approximate binding site for each factor ( Fig .
5D ) .
The binding sites were further defined by mutations within competitor oligonucleotides ( summarized in Fig .
5D ) .
The Jx and LBF1 complexes were both inhibited by the -236 to -215 oligonucleotide ( Fig .

Two separate trinucleotide mutations within this oligonucleotide at the Jk site ( Fig .

The putative Jx complex was also inhibited by a site derived from the EBV LMP2A EZ2RE ( 16 ) ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , preincubation of extract with a glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) fusion protein resin ( 48 ) efficiently depleted the putative Jk-binding activity from nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) , confirming that this complex is due to Jk .

Mutation of the PU.1 site facilitates detection of other factors that bind to a -236/-145 LMP-1 E2RE , including Jx and AMLA .
EMSA analysis of B-cell extract with a -236/-145 LMP-1 probe mutated at the PU.1 site ( same mutation as in Fig .

Overlapping competitor oligonucleotides ( described below in panel D ) were used to localize the binding site for each factor .
( B ) Binding sites for each factor were further defined by mutated competitor oligonucleotides .
( C ) The LBF ] complex is supershifted by AML1 antibody ( lane 2 ) and not by control antibody to PU.1 ( lane 1 ) .

the LBF1 complex but not the Jx complex ( Fig .
5B , lane 4 , and data not shown ) .
The identity of LBF1 as AML1 was confirmed by incubation of nuclear extract with anti-AML1 antibody prior to EMSA .
Anti-AML1 but not control antibody ( Fig .
5C , lanes 2 and 1 , respectively ) resulted in an additional supershifted complex and partial depletion of the LBF1 complex , confirming that LBF1 is AML1 .
The supershifted AML1 complex was inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing a CBFa « ( murine AML1 } ) -binding site ( 47 ) that is also recognized by human AML1 ( 30 ) .
The AML1 , LBFS5 , and LBF6 complexes were all partially inhibited by a -227 to -203 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5B , lane 6 ) .
Competition for the AML1 complex was unexpected with -227 to -203 , since it does not include the entire AML1 consensus .
Inspection of the -227 to -203 sequence , however , revealed a degenerate ( 5- of 6-bp match ) AML1 site , TGT GGG , at -220 to -216 ( within the Jx consensus [ Fig .
SDJ ) .
Mutation within this site ( Fig .
5D , -227/-203A1 ) completely disrupted AML1 inhibition by this oligonucleotide .
In the context of the native LMP-1 promoter sequence , this degenerate AML1 site within the Jx site does not have significant binding activity , since the -236 to -215 oligonucleotide which includes both the consensus AML1 site at -224 to -229 and the degenerate site at -220 to -216 does not bind any AML1 258 JOHANNSEN ET AL .
when the consensus site is mutated ( Fig .
5D ) .
Mutation of the -227 to =-203 oligonucleotide at -211 to -215 ( Fig .
5D , -227/-203A¥1 ) also disrupted the partial inhibition of LBFS and LBF6 ( Fig .
5B , lane 7 ) , whereas an adjacent pentanucle-otide mutation at -208 to -204 ( Fig .
5D , -227/-203A2 ) had no effect on competitor activity ( results not shown ) .
Since the mutation of nucleotides -208 to -204 did not ablate competition by the -227/-203A2 oligonucleotide , the LBFS- and LBF6-binding site ( s ) must lie between -227 and -209 ( Fig .
5D ) .
The LBF7 complex was inhibited by both the -227 to -203 and -215 to -192 overlapping oligonucleotides ( Fig .
5B , lanes 6 and 8 ) , thus narrowing its binding site to within 13 bp ( -215 to -203 ) .
An array of mutations placed within both of these oligonucleotides ( Fig .
5D ) allowed further localization of LBF7 .
Five separate mutations that fell within the -211 to -203 sequence GCCCCCCGG ( Fig .
5D , -215/-192A1 , -215/-192A2 , -215/-192A3 , -215/-192M44 , and -227 -203A2 ) disrupted LBF7 competition ( Fig .
5B , lane 9 , and data not shown ) , whereas three mutations that bracket this sequence on either end ( Fig .
5D , -227/-203A1 , -215/ -192A5 , and -215/-192A6 ) had no effect on LBF7 competition ( Fig .
5B , lane 7 , and not shown ) .
These data thus map the LBF7 recognition site to the sequence GCCCCCCGG .
The LBF3-binding site was less precisely mapped .
LBF3 was inhibited by unlabeled -236/-145APU.1 probe ( Fig .
5A , lane 3 ) and partially inhibited by the -215/-145 , -215/-174 , and -236/-196 oligonucleotides ( Fig .
5A , lanes 4 , 6 , and 7 , respectively ) .
The smaller overlapping 22-bp oligonucleotides derived from this region ( Fig .
5D , -236/-215 , -227/-203 , and -215/-192 ) failed to compete for LBF3 binding ( Fig .
5B , lanes 3 , 6 , and 8 ) .
This indicates that the core of the LBF3-binding site is likely to be within the sequence from -215 to -196 and that additional 5 ' and 3 ' sequences are required for optimal binding .
Mutation of residues -208 to -201 in the context of the full-length -236 to -145 E2RE oligonucleotide ( see Fig .
5D , -215/-192A1 , for mutation ) , however , did not eliminate its ability to compete for LBF3 .
Thus , the core of the LBF3-binding site is between -215 and -196 , and nucleotides -208 through -201 are not critical for sequence-specific binding .
Lymphocytes and epithelial cells express different nuclear factors that recognize the LMP-1 E2RE .
Previous studies have demonstrated that EBNA-2 responsiveness of the LMP-1 E2RE is readily demonstrable in B lymphocytes but not in T lymphocytes or epithelial cells ( 12 , 46 ) .
To determine which factors might be responsible for LMP-1 EZRE cell type specificity , EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts from various epithelial and B-lymphocyte cell lines , using the -236/ -145 and -236/-145APU.1 LMP probes .
EBV-positive cell lines were also tested to ascertain whether any LMP-1 EZRE-binding factors are modulated by EBV latent-gene expression .
Figure 6A demonstrates that Jx was present in B , T , and epithelial cells while PU.1 expression was restricted to B cells , in agreement with the previously reported distribution of these factors ( 17 , 22 ) .
LBF3 , LBF5 , and LBF7 were also expressed in all cell lines tested ( Fig .
6B ) .
LBF4 was present in B and T lymphocytes but absent from epithelial cells ( Fig .
6A ) .
LBF1/ AML1 was restricted to B cells and was upregulated in EBV-positive B-cell lines , except in the BL41 cell line infected with the defective P3HR1 virus ( Fig .
6B ) .
P3HR1 virus expresses only EBNA-1 , EBNA-3A , EBNA-3B , and EBNA-3C in latently infected cells .
A novel complex , LBF2 , was noted only in epithelial cells ( Fig .
6 ) and was localized by competition experiments to the LBF7-binding region between -215 and -192 ( data not shown ) .

Mutation of nucleotides -211 to -213 disrupted the binding of Jx and reduced the EBNA-2 responsiveness of the p-236/LMP ( Fig .
7A ) or pTK-236/ -145 ( Fig .
7B ) constructs from 10- to 3.2-fold or from 4.7- to 2.0-fold , respectively .
Mutation of nucleotides -230 to -228 disrupted LBF1/AML1 binding and had a small effect on the EBNA-2 responsiveness of p-236/LMP in the one experiment shown for this construct ( Fig .
7A ) .
In other experiments , the AML1l-binding-site mutant had slightly greater EBNA-2 responsiveness than did the wild type ( data not shown ) .
This indicates that AML1 binding is not required for EBNA-2 responsiveness .
The LBFA4 mutation ( Fig .
2A , -176/-151A1 ) also had little effect on the activity of -236/LMP ( results not shown ) .
However , this does not rule out the participation of LBF4 in EZRE activity , since this mutation only partially disrupts binding activity ( Fig .
2B ) .
Disruption of both PU.1 and LBF4 binding with the -166 to -164 mutation surprisingly abolished EBNA-2 responsiveness of the LMP-1 EZRE in the context of the p-236/LMP , p-215/LMP , and pTK-236/-145 constructs ( Fig .
7 ) .
Thus , PU.1 ( or , less probably , LBF4 ) is an essential mediator of LMP-1 EBNA-2 transactivation , while Jx is critical for full EBNA-2 responsiveness .
GST-EBNA-2 fusion protein interacts directly with PU.1 .
The dramatic effect of the PU.1 mutation on EBNA-2 responsiveness could be due to a direct interaction between EBNA-2 and PU.1 .
To test this hypothesis , a GST-EBNA-2 fusion protein containing EBNA-2 residues 310 to 376 [ GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) ( 48 ) ] bound to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with either B-cell nuclear extract or *°S-labeled in vitro EBNA-2 TRANSACTIVATION OF LMP-1 259 A B bul b=l bt -LBF4 U - “ -PU.1 79- 50° se - -- -PU.j 85- n ﬁ-probe 3 1 2 4 5 6 FIG .

EBNA-2 interacts directly with PU.1 .
Purified GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) protein can bind in vitro translated PU.1 ( A ) or can deplete PU.1 from crude nuclear extract ( B ) .
S-labeled in vitro translated PU.1 ( lane 1 ) was incubated with glutathione Sepharose-bound GST ( lane 2 ) or GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) ( lane 3 ) for 1 h. After being washed , the beads were eluted in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE .
The amount of reticulocyte lysate in lane 1 is one-third of that used in the experiments for lanes 2 and 3 .
The position of the 45-kDa PU.1 polypeptide is indicated .
In panel B , B-cell nuclear extract ( lane 4 ) was incubated twice for 30 min each with GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) ( lane 5 ) or with GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-337 ) ( lane 6 ) .
The extracts were then analyzed by EMSA with a -236/-145 probe .
The positions of PU.1 and LBF4 EMSA complexes are indicated .
translated PU.1 ( Fig .
8 ) .
As shown in lanes 2 and 3 , GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) ( 48 ) adsorbed about 30 % of *°S-labeled recombinant PU.1 protein whereas GST absorbed little or no PU.1 .
The GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) fusion protein also extensively depleted PU.1 EMSA activity from B-cell nuclear ex-tracts , whereas a smaller protein , GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-337 ) , had little effect ( lanes 4 to 6 ) .
Thus , the EBNA-2 domain from amino acids 310 to 376 can interact with recombinant PU.1 and can specifically deplete native PU.1 from nuclear extracts .
As a further internal control , LBF4 , which also binds to the -236 to -145 probe , was not depleted by incubation with GST-EBNA-2 ( 310-376 ) protein ( lane 6 ) .
An attempt to immunoprecipitate in vitro translated PU.1 with in vitro translated full-length EBNA-2 and an EBNA-2 monoclonal antibody ( PEZ [ 49 ] ) was unsuccessful ( results not shown ) .
This may be due to the much smaller amount of EBNA-2 used in this experiment ( at least 100-fold less than in the GST-EBNA-2 experiment ) .
DISCUSSION These and previous data demonstrate that the EBV LMP-1 promoter is dependent for its activation on the interaction of EBNA-2 with both ubiquitous and tissue-specific host cell factors ( Fig .
9 ) .
Binding-site mutational analysis showed that EBNA-2 activation of the LMP-1 promoter in B cells is partially dependent on interaction with the ubiquitous Jx protein and is completely dependent on interaction with the B-lymphocyte- , macrophage- , and erythropoietic-cell-specific PU.1 protein .
At least six other B-cell proteins bind to a -236 to -145 LMP-1 minimal EZRE and may also be involved in EBNA-2 responsiveness ( Fig .
9 ) .
Of these , the AML1- and LBF4-binding sites have been specifically mutated , and these binding sites appear not to be critical for EBNA-2 responsiveness .
Since a -215 LMP-1 promoter construct is partially EBNA-2 responsive , whereas a -205 construct is not ( Fig .
1A ) ( 41 ) , a factor which interacts with -215 to -205 is likely to be important for EBNA-2 response .
LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , or LBF7 map within or near this critical -215 to -205 site and may therefore mediate this effect .
LBF3 and LBF7 bind to a -215/-145 probe , while LBF5 and LBF6 require additional upstream sequence , which could be sequence nonspecific and 260 JOHANNSEN ET AL .

Model of EBNA-2 interactions with E2RE-binding factors and basal transcription factors in B lymphocytes .
EBNA-2 is an acidic transcriptional transactivator which requires sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins to direct it to response elements .
The EBNA-2 acidic domain can interact with TFIIB , TAF40 , and TFIIH in stimulating transcription .
Whether it does so sequentially or as a complex of more than one EBNA-2 molecule interacting simultaneously with more than one factor remains to be determined .
Jx is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein which recognizes a GTGGGAA sequence present in all E2REs and interacts with a 27-amino-acid domain of EBNA-2 that includes the sequence GPPWWPP .
The LMP1 promoter has Jx-binding sites at -298 to -290 and -223 to -213 .
Truncation of the -298 to -290 Jx site has surprisingly little effect on EBNA-2 responsiveness in these and previous experiments .
Truncation to -214 removes the more-proximal Jx site as well as the AMLA1 site and encroaches on the LBF5 and LBF6 sites .
However , the effect on EBNA-2 responsiveness is similar to that of a specific mutation in the J « -binding site ( i.e. , a 50 % reduction in EBNA-2 responsiveness ) .
EBNA-2 can also interact with PU.1 , and this interaction is likely to account for the B-lymphocyte specificity of the EBNA-2 responsiveness of the LMP1 promoter .
Mutation of the PU.1-binding site has a profound effect on EBNA-2 responsiveness .
However , the PU.1 site is active only in the context of upstream sequence to -215 , which includes the LBF3- and LBF7- and at least part of the LBF5- and LBF6-binding sites .
Which of these factors acts in conjunction with PU.1 to convey EBNA-2 responsiveness is not known .
An epithelial-cell-specific factor , LBF2 , which recognizes a -215 to -192 site is also identified in this study .
LBF2 could account for the importance of the -214 to -144 LMP-1 promoter sequence in the high basal activity of the promoter in epithelial cells ( 12 ) .
A previously described silencer is also shown ( 12 ) .
-150 -100 +1 may be provided by the -215 LMP-1 promoter CAT construct .
Interaction of one of these factors with EBNA-2 may account for the activity of the -215 LMP-1 promoter construct , or a less direct interaction could be responsible .
Experiments to detect a direct interaction of LBF3 or LBF7 with EBNA-2 have so far been unsuccessful ( unpublished results ) .
Although EBNA-2 has a high specific affinity for Jx and all EBNA-2-responsive promoters have one or more J-binding sites ( 16 , 19 ) , the variable importance of this interaction to the regulation of different EZREs is surprising .
Cp E2RE activity is absolutely dependent on Jx , since an EBNA-2 WW to SS or SR mutation at positions 319 and 320 , which disrupts Jx interaction , or a mutation in the Jx DNA-binding site independently abolish Cp EBNA-2 responsiveness ( 16 , 19 , 20 , 25 , 48 ) .
In contrast , the same EBNA-2 mutation or inactivating or deletional mutations of the LMP-1 -298 to -290 and -223 to -213 IJk-binding sites result in only a twofold decrease in LMP-1 transactivation ( Fig .
1 ) ( 12 , 48 ) .
Furthermore , a -335 to -214 LMP-1 promoter DNA fragment which has both Jk sites conveys only low-level activity to a basal TK promoter in the presence of EBNA-2 , while a -214 to -144 fragment which lacks both sites showed sevenfold activation in the presence of EBNA-2 ( 12 ) .
Even the Cp and LMP-2 EZREs can not be limited to a Jx site ( s ) and bind other , as yet uncharacterized , factors ( 20 , 25 , 51 ) .
Thus , there is abundant evidence for cooperative functional interactions between EBNA-2 and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins besides Jx .
Computer searches of each E2RE for common transcription factor-binding sites has , however , turned up only the Jx-binding sequence ( unpublished observations ) .
J. ViroL .
The central importance of the PU.1 site in LMP-1 EBNA-2 responsiveness appears to explain the restriction of EBNA-2 transactivation of the LMP1 promoter to B lymphocytes as opposed to T lymphocytes or epithelial cells ( 12 , 46 ) .
PU.1 plays a key role in the expression of a number of lincage-specific genes in macrophages , B cells , and erythroid cells .
These include the x and A immunoglobulin light chain , macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor , and B-globin genes ( 10 , 15 , 35 , 50 ) .
The mechanism of PU.1 activation of these genes is unknown , although , as is seen with the LMP-1 EZRE , their activity is absolutely dependent on PU.1 binding .
PU.1 has only a weak activation domain in a proline- , glutamate- , serine- , and threonine-rich ( PEST ) region ( 35 ) .
In the x and A light-chain enhancers , PU.1 activity is dependent on an associated factor , NF-EMS5 , which binds to both PU.1 and an adjacent DNA sequence , even though NF-EMS can not itself bind DNA ( 10 , 35 ) .
NF-EMS interacts with PU.1 through the PEST domain ( 35 ) , and its binding is dependent on phosphor-ylation of specific PU.1 residues ( 36 ) .
Like Jx , PU.1 alone could not convey EBNA-2 responsiveness to the LMP1 promoter .
Although the PU.1 site is at -169 to -158 , a -205 to +40 LMP1 promoter was not EBNA-2 responsive .
Addition of sequences to -215 rendered the fragment significantly EBNA-2 responsive , indicating a requirement for LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , or LBF7 for PU.1 responsiveness .
In fact , a -214 to -144 fragment is sufficient to convey EBNA-2 responsiveness to a basal TK promoter under sensitive assay conditions ( 12 ) .
We have demonstrated direct high level interaction between a GST-EBNA-2 fusion protein and PU.1 .
The EBNA-2 domain responsible for this interaction ( amino acids 310 to 376 ) can also interact with Jk ( 48 ) .
The minimal domain for Jk interaction consists of residues 310 to 337 ( 48 ) , and that domain is not sufficient for PU.1 interaction , suggesting that sequence between amino acids 337 and 376 is important for PU.1 interaction .
The physiologic importance of the in vitro PU.1-EBNA-2 interaction is indicated by the absolute dependence of the LMP-1 E2RE on the PU.1 site .
Site-specific mutational analyses of the PU.1-EBNA-2 310 to 376 interactive domain and correlations of PU.1 association in vitro and in vivo with EBNA-2 activity in LMP-1 transactivation will provide further important tests of the current working model of direct EBNA-2-PU.1 interaction .
From a more formalistic perspective , PU.1 potentiation of EBNA-2 effects could be due to cooperation with other EBNA-2-binding proteins such as Jk in assembly of an EBNA-2 complex at the LMP-1 promoter , to an effect on DNA binding so that EBNA-2 molecules are more favorably positioned relative to the promoter ( as has been suggested for high-mobility group domain proteins in the human beta interferon promoter [ 9 ] ) , to enhanced recruitment of specific basal factors or activators , or to effects on local chromatin or nucleosome architecture .
Interaction with and reversal of the negative effect of a silencer which maps between -112 and -55 is also a possibility ( 12 ) .
Genetic and biochemical data indicate that transcriptional transactivation by EBNA-2 is ultimately mediated by the interaction of the acidic domain with TFIIB , TAF40 , and TFIIH ( 40 ) .
Multiple EBNA-2 molecules may be required at a promoter site for TFIIB , TAFA40 , and TFIIH interactions .
EMSAs of the LMP-1 promoter revealed that in addition to PU.1 , a distinct but much less abundant factor , LBF4 , binds to an overlapping recognition site and is found in B- or T-cell nuclear extracts .
Methylation interference demonstrated that LBF4 recognized the same core guanosines as PU.1 , yet it is unlikely to be an ets family protein , since it is larger than any Vou .
69 , 1995 mammalian ets protein ( 105 kDa [ 28 ] ) and does not react with an antibody directed at the conserved ets domain .
The recently cloned NF-AT proteins NF-ATc and NF-ATp bind to a similar purine-rich sequence and have apparent molecular masses of 105 to 120 kDa , respectively ( 29 , 33 ) .
Although LBF4 did not react with antibody directed to rat NF-ATp , LBF4 could be another NF-AT family member , such as NF-ATc ( 33 ) .
NF-AT is characteristically activated by B- or T-cell activation and inhibited by cyclosporin A .
The effect of B- or T-cell activation and cyclosporin A on LBF4 would be of interest .
Although LMP-1 promoter constructs with an LBF4-binding-site mutation were still EBNA-2 responsive , LBF4 could be important in regulating LMP1 promoter activity in latently infected cells that are stimulated by antigen or other extracellular ligands .
AML1 also binds to the LMP-1 EZ2RE but has little effect on EBNA-2 responsiveness in B-lymphoma cells .
The AML1 gene was identified in leukemic chromosomal translocations that fuse the N-terminal portion , including its DNA-binding do-main , with various other cellular genes ( 11 , 31 , 32 , 34 ) .
Human AML1 may have a C-terminal activation domain exon that would be homologous to the C-terminal activation domain of the murine AML1 , PEA2 ( 2 ) .
This exon would be removed in the translocated AML1 gene .
Interestingly , EBV -transformed B cells seem to have a greater abundance of AML1 EMSA activity , raising the possibility that AML1 has a role in the establishment or maintenance of the EBV growth-transformed phenotype .
The only other cell-type-specific LMP1 EZ2RE-binding protein identified in this study was LBF2 , which recognizes a site in the -215 to -192 sequence .
The factor appears to be epithelial-cell-line specific .
LBF2 may mediate the EBNA-2 independent constitutive activity of the LMP-1 promoter in epithelial cells , which has been shown to be dependent on sequence between -214 and -144 ( 12 ) .
The finding that EBNA-2 transactivation is dependent on multiple cellular factors and that it may physically interact with at least two separate factors on the same promoter suggests a complex mechanism of action , as seen with other viral trans-activators such as VP16 and E1A .
VP16 interacts not only with Oct-1 but also with the cellular protein complex host cell factor to activate herpes simplex virus early-gene promoters ( 23 , 26 , 37 , 39 ) .
E1A interacts with seemingly disparate cellular transcription factors ( 26 ) , which probably explains its greater promiscuity among target promoters and host cells .
Although the recent identification of the EZRE targeting factor Jx is a major breakthrough ( 16 , 19 ) , the further identification of a role for PU.1 indicates that EBNA-2 transactivation involves more than simple promoter targeting by Jx .
Delineation of the full array of factor interactions essential for LMP1 expression in EBV-infected cells is of substantial importance in understanding the biology of EBV latent infection .
Since LMP -1 is critical in the pathogenesis of EBV-induced cell transformations ( 21 ) , factors essential for LMP-1 expression are potential targets for anti-LMP-1 pharmaceuticals .
