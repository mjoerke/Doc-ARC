These parameters were examined in normal and Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized human B cells and compared with 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , -responsive cells of the T and monocytic lineages .
Although resting tonsillar B cells did not express VDR mRNA , activation of these cells with interleu-kin-4 induced VDR in the absence of exogenously supplemented 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , .
As indicators of hormone-mediated gene regulation we analyzed modulation of CD23 , a common B cell/monocyte surface antigen , and 24-hydroxylase .
1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells , yet failed to modulate CD23 expression in B cells .
Furthermore , 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , induced 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin-activated T cells , yet failed to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells .
These findings suggest that although human B lymphocytes can express VDR mRNA and protein , they exhibit a functional block for vitamin D-dependent gene regulation .
The role of the steroid hormone 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , ' the active metabolite of vitamin D ; , has been widely documented in calcium metabolism .
However , recent observations indicate that it also functions as an important immunohematopoietic regulatory hormone ( 1-3 ) .
Newly defined biological functions ascribed to 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; include modulation of cellular growth , differ-entiation , and function in a variety of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells ( 4 ) encompassing both lymphoid ( 5 , 6 ) and myeloid ( 7 , 8 ) lineages .

intestinal mucosa ) , a majority of the cellular actions of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , are thought to be mediated by specific intracellular vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) that bind the hormone with high affinity and selectivity ( 11 ) .
Hormone-occupied receptor can bind to genomic responsive elements and regulate transcription of specific genes , resulting in various biologic responses .
Expression of VDR has been documented in hematopoietic cells .
Although monocytic cells constitutively express VDR which can be up-regulated by 1 @ ,25- ( 0H ) , D , ( 12 , 13 ) , their expression in T lymphocytes requires as yet poorly defined activation event ( s ) ( 12 , 14 ) .
Interestingly , 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , acts as an immunosuppressive agent on T cells in a fashion similar to that of other immunosuppressive drugs , such as cyclosporin A ( 15 ) .
The target of action in both cases is at the transcriptional level modulating early gene activation , such as IL-2 production ( 15 , 16 ) .
The role of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D , on B cell function has yet to be fully elucidated , and initial observations have yielded conflicting evidence .
Initial reports indicated that VDR expression could be induced in B lymphocytes upon activation ( 14 , 17 ) , yet a subsequent report cited that in B lymphocytes , nonexpression of VDR mRNA is a dominant feature ( 18 ) .
Furthermore , although it has been reported that B cell proliferation ( 19 ) and immunoglobulin production ( 17 , 19 ) are inhibited by 1 @ ,25- ( O0H ) ; D ; , others have been unable to detect 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated inhibition of B cell function ( 20 , 21 ) .
These observations may be further compromised by the involvement of accessory cells ; inhibition of B cell function may be an indirect result of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated inhibition of T cell help and/or proliferation ( 6 , 22 ) or an indirect result of 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated inhibition of cytokine production by monocytes/macrophages ( 20 ) .
To further our understanding of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated genomic regulation and its influence on B cell functions , we have examined its effects on normal human tonsillar B cells and Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -immortalized human B cells .
Hormone-mediated regulation of B cell activity was assessed by its antiproliferation effect , as well as its capacity to modulate expression of a differentiation antigen , CD23 , a unique type-II transmembrane protein which is expressed on many hematopoietic cell types .
CD23 expression is induced by IL-4 in B lymphocytes ( 23 ) and monocytes ( 24 ) , and it is constitutively expressed on EBV-immortalized B cells ( 25 , 26 ) and a monocytic leukemia cell line U937 ( 27 ) .
CD23 has been characterized as a low-affinity IgE receptor ( 28 ) that interacts specifically with CD21 ( 29 ) , and it has been implicated in modulating IgE-mediated immune response ( 30 ) .
Human B cells were charac-terized , both quantitatively and qualitatively , for their capacity to express VDR mRNA and protein .
As it has been reported that resting lymphocytes do not express VDR ( 14 , 17 ) , we have utilized recombinant human IL-4 as well as EBV immortalization as activating agents .
As an additional indicator of hor- 13437 13438 mone-mediated gene modulation , we have investigated 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA , as well as its ability to convert 1a,25- ( OH ) ; , D , into 1a,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OBH ) , D , .
The results obtained with human B lymphocytes have been compared and contrasted with the effects of 1 @ ,25- { ( 0H ) , D , on model hematopoietic cell targets ; U937 , a human monocytic leukemia cell line ( 31 , 32 ) , and normal human T lymphocytes ( 5 , 33 ) .
Our results suggest that human B lymphocytes exhibit a functional block for 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D ; , -mediated gene regulation , irrespective of their ability to express VDR .

( 41 ) .
Cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in 5 x packed cell volumes of 1 x hypo-TD + protease inhibitors ( 100 mx Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 5 mm dithiothreitol , 2 mm phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride , 2 ug/ml leupeptin , and 2 ug/ml aproti-nin ) .
Following a brief incubation period on ice , cells were centrifuged at 400 x g. The cell pellets were resuspended in 2 x packed cell volumes of 1 x hypo-TD + protease inhibitors and disrupted by Dounce homogenization with a tight-fitting pestle .
The suspension was then made to 0.3 M KC ] and allowed to incubate on ice for 30 min .
Subsequently the lysate was centrifuged at 105,000 x g for 1 h in an L8-55 Beckman ultracen-trifuge .
The lysate was then made 20 % with glycerol and stored at -80 °C .
Total protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit .
Immunoprecipitation of VDR-The anti-vitamin D receptor monoclonal antibody 9477 ( Affinity Bioreagents ) was covalently cross-linked to protein-G-Sepharose ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. ) using the method of Schneider et al .

One-milligram aliquots of total cellular protein were preabsorbed with activated quenched protein-G-Sepharose for 1.5 h at 4 °C .
Subsequently , absorbed extracts were incubated with the derivitized beads ( ~15 pl ) overnight at 4 °C with gentle mix-ing .
Following incubation , the derivitized beads were washed with TEDK/0.3* buffer ( 10 my Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 1.5 mm EDTA , 5 mm dithiothreitol , 0.3 1 KCl , 2 mm phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride , 2 ug/ml apro-tinin , 2 ug/ml leupeptin ) and finally with 0.5 m Tris , pH 6.8 .
Western Blotting-Immunoprecipitated samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-denaturing buffer and separated on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli ( 43 ) .
Proteins were elec-trophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Hybond ; Am-ersham Corp. ) in a Trans-Blot apparatus ( Bio-Rad ) according to manufacturer 's instruction .
Membranes were incubated with TBS-T buffer , pH 7.6 ( 20 my Tris base ; 137 mm NaCl ; 0.1 % Tween 20 ) containing 5 % dry milk , 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , and 1 mg/ml chicken egg albumin overnight at 4°C .

Membranes were washed , and antibody binding was detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents ( Amersham Corp. ) .
Metabolism Studies-1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , metabolism studies were performed as described ( 44 ) .
Briefly , 24-hydroxylase activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D , into 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( O0H ) , D ; , in intact cells using substrate concentrations of 1a,25- ( 0H ) , D ; , ( 1 um ) above the K , , values reported for this enzyme ( 45 ) .
High substrate concentrations enabled monitoring of 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) , D , production by utilization of HPLC combined with a photodiode array detector .
The primary metabolite ( 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) ; D , ) and other minor metabolites of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D , produced in different cell types were identified by their UV spectra obtained during the HPLC analysis of the lipid extract using the photodiode array detector .
Approximately 4 x 10° cells were cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FCS in the presence or absence of 200 units/ml IL-4 to effect cellular activation ; tonsillar T cells were also activated with 15 ug/ml PHA-P. 14,25- ( OH ) , D , was subsequently added at a concentration of 5 x 10~ m for an additional 48 h to maximally stimulate metabolic enzymes .
At 72 h of culture , cells were washed and media and FCS were replenished , and 1 ux 1a,25- ( OH ) , ; D , was added for an additional 24 h. The reaction was then stopped with methanol , and lipid extraction was performed using the method of Bligh and Dyer ( 46 ) .
The lipid extract was analyzed by HPLC using a Waters model 600 equipped with a model 990 photodiode array detector ( Waters Associates , Milford , MA ) .
Mass spectra ( 70 eV ) of purified 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) ; D , produced in both U937 cells and normal tonsillar T cells were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5985 B mass spectrometer as described ( 44 , 47 ) .
RESULTS Effect of 10,25- ( OH ) , D , on CD23 Expression-Our preliminary experiments suggested that 14,25- ( OH ) , D , did not modulate proliferation of either EBV-positive B9 cells or activated normal human tonsillar B cells ( data not shown ) .
These results are in conflict with the reported activity of 1 « ,25- ( O0H ) , D , on T cells ( 5 , 15 , 33 ) and monocytes ( 32 , 48 , 49 ) .

The x axis shows the logarithmic intensity of green fluorescence and the y axis depicts relative cell number .
observations we analyzed the effect of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , treatment on surface expression of the CD23 antigen .
As CD23 expression has been shown to be inhibited by 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , ; in monocytes ( 50 ) , it is an excellent model for comparative analysis of 1 @ « ,25- ( OH ) , gene regulation in human B cells and monocytic cells .
As depicted by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter histograms shown in Fig .
1 , IL-4-mediated enhancement of CD23 expression in monocytic U937 cells was negatively modulated by 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , ( panel A ) , in agreement with a previous report ( 50 ) .
Concurrently these cells were also analyzed for surface expression of CD11b ( Mo-1 ) , an adhesion molecule of the B , -integrin family ( 51 ) whose expression correlates well with monocytic differentiation ( 52 ) .
Treatment with 1 @ « ,25- ( O0H ) , D ; and IL-4 dramatically up-regulated surface expression of the CD11b antigen ( Fig .
1 , panel B ) , indicative of cellular differentiation .
In contrast , treatment of B9 cells with 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , did not modulate IL-4-enhanced CD23 surface expression ( Fig .
1 , panel C ) .
Furthermore , CD23 protein expression was not modulated in these cells by treatment with 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , for other intervals of culture .
Analogously , 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , did not modulate IL-4-induced CD23 protein expression in normal tonsillar B cells ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , down-regu-lates CD23 expression in monocytic cells , yet does not modulate CD23 antigen expression in either normal or immortalized human B lymphocytes .

Effect of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , on CD23b mRNA expression .
U937 cells and B9 cells were cultured in various concentrations of 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , plus 100 units/ml IL4 .
After 72 h of culture , total RNA was isolated , and equal amounts ( 20 ug ) were electrophoresed and then blotted onto a nylon membrane .
The membrane was hybridized with a `` P-labeled 60-mer CD23b antisense oligonucleotide , stripped , and rehybridized with a P-labeled 195-base pair PCR product complementary to sequences of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) mRNA to confirm RNA quality and quantity ( see `` Experimental Procedures '' ) .

observation that CD23 can be expressed in at least two molecular isoforms , designated CD23a and CD23b , which are the result of different initiation sites and alternative splicing ( 53 ) .
Both isoforms are expressed on IL-4-treated B cells , whereas only the b isoform is expressed on monocytes .
Thus it is possible that 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , may preferentially modulate expression of only a single molecular isoform or induce reciprocal modulation of the two isoforms , thereby rendering analysis by antigen expression inappropriate .
To circumvent this dilemma , we exploited sequence differences in the 5'-end region of CD23a and CD23b cDNAs by utilizing unique antisense oligonucleotide probes complementary to these regions .
Using these antisense oligonucleotide probes , we analyzed CD23a and CD23b mRNA expression in U937 and EBV-immortalized B cells treated with various concentrations of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , in the presence of IL-4 .
As expected , CD23b mRNA expression was found to be significantly down-modulated in U937 cells after culture with 1 @ « ,25- ( OH ) , D , ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast , CD23b mRNA was not modulated in B9 cells treated with as much as 1 um 1 @ « ,25- ( 0H ) , D , ( Fig .
2 ) .
Also , treatment with various concentrations of 1 « ,25- ( 0H ) , D ; , did not modulate CD23a mRNA expression in the EBV-immortalized B cells ( data not shown ) .
These observations correlate well with the flow cytometry analysis , substantiating the contention that 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , negatively modulates CD23 in U937 cells , yet does not modulate CD23 expression in human B lymphocytes .
Induction of VDR mRNA in B Lymphocytes-The apparent refractory response of B lymphocytes to inhibition of proliferation or alteration of phenotype expression by 1 @ « ,25- ( OH ) , D , led us to question whether these cells express or could be induced to express VDR .
We undertook experiments to determine if VDR mRNA could be detected in either EBV-positive B9 cells , or normal human tonsillar B cells , in the absence or presence of IL-4 .
In these experiments , U937 cells were used as a positive control indicator of the 4.6-kilobase VDR mRNA ( 18 , 49 ) .
The VDR mRNA signal was weak from total RNA obtained from EBV-immortalized B cells ( Fig .

Induction of VDR mRNA .
B9 cells , normal tonsillar B cells , and U937 cells were treated with 10 % m 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , for 24 h. Tonsillar B cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 100 units/ml IL-4 for 72 h. 10 ug of polyadenylated mRNA ( lanes 1 , 2 , and 4 ) or 20 ug of total RNA ( Zanes 3 , 5 , and 6 ) were electrophoresed and then blotted onto nylon membranes .
The membranes were hybridized with a P-labeled hVDR cDNA probe , stripped , and rehybridized with a P-labeled 195-base pair PCR product complementary to sequences of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) mRNA to confirm RNA quality ( see `` Experimental Procedures '' ) .

evident with poly ( A ) * RNA from EBV-immortalized B cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and U937 cells ( lane 4 ) .
Unstimulated tonsillar B cells exhibited no detectable mRNA hybridizing with the hVDR probe ( lane 5 ) , yet activation with IL-4 was sufficient for induction of VDR mRNA expression ( lane 6 ) .
To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of interleukin-4-mediated induction of VDR in the absence of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D ; , .
Although trace quantities of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , may have been present in the FCS , it was clearly insufficient to up-regulate VDR mRNA expression in the absence of IL-4-mediated activation ( lane 5 ) .
These observations support the contention ( 14 , 17 ) that vitamin D receptor expression can be induced in activated human B lymphocytes .
Demonstration of VDR Protein by - Immunoblot-Demonstration of expression of VDR mRNA prompted us to investigate whether translation of VDR mRNA was occurring in human B lymphocytes and if this event resulted in a mature protein of correct molecular mass ( 54 , 55 ) .
Immunoblotting analysis of immunoprecipitated extracts from cells of various hematopoietic lineages was performed using a monoclonal antibody raised against the chick intestinal VDR ( 56 ) .
Immunoprecipitated extracts obtained from lectin-activated tonsillar T cells and U937 cells were used as reference sources known to express VDR protein ( 12 , 31 , 33 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4 , cross-reacting protein with an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 50 kDa was detected in immunoprecipitated extracts from activated tonsillar T cells ( lane 1 ) and U937 cells ( lane 6 ) .
Cross-reactive protein was also detected , albeit to a lesser ex-tent , in immunoprecipitated extracts from activated tonsillar B cells ( lane 2 ) as well as EBV-positive B9 cells ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Interestingly , cross-reactive protein derived from activated tonsillar B cells was detected as two distinct molecular species ; the cross-reactive protein exhibiting a reduced electrophoretic mobility may be indicative of occupied VDR which have undergone covalent modification ( 57 ) .

reduced electrophoretic mobility was the only immunoreactive protein detected in EBV-positive B9 cells ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
VDR protein detected in the cellular extract obtained from nonacti-vated peripheral blood leukocytes ( lane 3 ) was probably contributed by contaminating monocytes , which are known to constitutively express VDR ( 12 ) , and highlights the exquisite sensitivity of the enhanced chemiluminescence technique .
The additional cross-reacting protein detected in immunoprecipitated cellular extracts from activated tonsillar T and B cells ( lanes 1 and 2 , respectively ) is probably nonspecific , as it was not detected in the other immunoprecipitated cellular extracts .
These results suggest that translation of VDR mRNA does occur in activated human tonsillar B cells and EBV-immortalized B cells and that the resulting protein exhibits an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of VDR protein derived from activated T lymphocytes and myeloid cells .
B Lymphocytes Fail to Metabolize 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , -As activated normal and immortalized B lymphocytes were found to express VDR mRNA and protein , yet were apparently refractory to antiproliferative or differentiation effects of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D ; , , we exploited the phenomenon of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , -de-pendent 24-hydroxylase induction to determine whether a functional hormone-receptor complex was established .
It has been shown recently that 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , mediates its control of 24-hydroxylase expression at the transcriptional level ( 58 ) ; or-dinarily , 24-hydroxylase activity is not detected in hematopoietic cells unless they are stimulated with 1 « ,25- ( 0H ) , D , ( 59 ) .
From the representative HPLC chromatographic profiles depicted in Fig .
5 , it is clear that U937 cells pretreated with 1a,25- ( OH ) , ; D , ( 5 x 10~® m ) attain the ability to convert 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , into 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) , D , and that this ability is enhanced significantly in the presence of IL-4 .
On the contrary , B9 and normal tonsillar B cells pretreated with 1 « ,25- ( 0H ) , D ; , even in the presence of IL-4 , did not show any evidence of 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) , D , production .
However , unlike tonsillar B cells , tonsillar T cells ( activated with PHA and IL-4 ) produced a significant amount of 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) , D ; , the production rate of which is similar to that observed in U937 cells plus IL-4 .
B Lymphocytes Fail to Induce 24-Hydroxylase mRNA-Since 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , metabolism is directly linked to hormone-mediated induction of 24-hydroxylase , we next investigated 1 @ « ,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA .

HPLC analysis of metabolites of 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , produced by tonsillar B , T , and U937 cells .
HPLC analysis of the lipid extracts of both cells and media obtained by incubating 4 x 10° cells for 24 h with 10° m 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D ; in 200 ml of media .
Cells were preactivated for 24 h in the absence or presence of 200 units/ml IL-4 ( tonsillar T cells were also activated with PHA ) and subsequently cultured with 5 x 10° m 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , for an additional 48 bh .
At 72 h of culture , cells were washed and media and FCS were replenished , and 107 m 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , was added for an additional 24 h. Chromatographic conditions : Zorbax-SIL column ( 25 cm x 4.6 mm ) , eluted with hexane:2-propanol ( 90:10 ) , at a flow rate of 2 ml/min .
Arrows indicate the elution position of a synthetic standard of 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) , D , .
At the elution position of 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( 0H ) , D ; , a minor lipid contaminant peak was noted in the HPLC chromatograms of both B9 and tonsillar B cells .
This lipid contaminant peak did not exhibit the typical UV spectrum of the vitamin D chromophore and was present in all HPLC chromatograms , including control incubation studies without cells ( data not shown ) .
The putative 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) , D , produced in U937 and tonsillar T cells was identified unequivocally as 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( 0H ) , D , through masss spectrometry ( data not shown ) .
the molecular size of the hybridizing species is in agreement with a recent report analyzing 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression in HL-60 cells ( 58 ) .
Also , the data indicate that expression of VDR mRNA in the absence of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D ; is not sufficient for the expression of 24-hydroxylase mRNA ( Zanes 1 and 2 ) , in agreement with previous reports ( 58 , 59 ) .
Interestingly , although this mRNA species was found not to be inducible in U937 cells by treatment with only IL-4 ( Zane 2 ) , there was an apparent enhancement of 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression when these monocytic cells were co-stimulated with 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , and IL-4 ( lane 4 ) .
In contrast , the human 24-hydroxylase cDNA probe failed to hybridize to mRNA derived from EBV-positive B9 cells treated with as much as 1 um 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , ( lanes 6-8 ) , nor was 24-hydroxylase mRNA found to be expressed constitutively ( lane 5 ) , nor was it inducible by treatment with only IL-4 ( lane 9 ) .
Furthermore , treatment with a combination of IL-4 and 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , failed to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression in the EBV-positive B9 cells ( lane 10 ) .
Taken together , the data indicate that expression of 24-hydroxylase mRNA is not induced in EBV-immortalized human B cells by either 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , or IL-4 or a combination of these two reagents .
These results corroborate the absence of 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , metabolism observed in human B lymphocytes ( see Fig .
5 ) .
DISCUSSION Prior cellular activation has become a hallmark of lymphoid cell bioresponsiveness to 1a,25- ( 0H ) , D , ( 12 , 14 , 17 ) .
Although all other known target cells of 1 @ « ,25- ( 0H ) , D , constitutively express VDR ( 11 ) , lymphoid cells are unique in that VDR is not constitutively expressed , and specific activation events are re quired for its genomic up-regulation .
Characterization of activation events mediating VDR up-regulation in T lymphocytes has only recently been investigated , and initial results have revealed the intricacy of this cellular checkpoint controlling bioresponsiveness to 1 @ « ,25- ( OH ) , D , ; ( 60 ) .
However , at this time little is known regarding the complexity of signals necessary and sufficient for expression of VDR in B lymphocytes .
Although initial reports indicated that receptor expression could be induced in heterogeneous populations of lymphoid cells upon activation ( 14 , 17 ) , a subsequent report cited that VDR mRNA could not be detected in numerous long term cultured human B cell lines ( 18 ) .
Therefore , we undertook experiments to determine if VDR could be detected in human B cells and if its expression was sufficient to confer bioresponsiveness to 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , .
We were unable to detect VDR , either at the mRNA or protein level in normal resting B lymphocytes , in agreement with previous reports ( 14 , 17 , 18 ) .
To effect cellular activation and putatively up-regulate VDR expression , we utilized either B cell immortalization with EBV and/or exogenous supplemen-tation with IL-4 .
EBV-positive B cells were found to constitutively express VDR mRNA and protein at modest yet detectable levels , supporting the contention ( 14 , 17 ) that vitamin D receptor expression can be induced in activated human B lymphocytes .
However , our use of IL-4 as an activating agent may be more physiologically relevant for induction of a bioresponse to 1a,25- ( OH ) , D ; , .
Biological activities of IL-4 are mediated by specific cell surface receptors which are constitutively expressed on primary cells and established cell lines of hematopoietic lineage , including T cells , B cells , and monocytes ( 61 ) .
Activation with IL-4 mimics antigen-mediated activation , resulting in an increase in cell volume ( 62 ) and expression of 13442 A B U937 cells B9 cells ( EBV* ) IL-4 = + =o = - s 40+ 1,25 ( OH ) , D3 =- - ++ to t 404+ -+ T J 103 ee , VDR -- - s » # # CB e ( 4.6 kb ) 24-0H -- « a ( 3.2 kb ) caPDH -- @ ep e e » @ # « o a ( 1.3 kb ) ® hnd bat 1 2 3 4 § 6 7 B 9 10 Fic .

Induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA by 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , .
U937 cells ( monoblasts ) and B9 cells ( EBV-immortalized B cells ) were treated with 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , for 24 h. 10 ug of poly ( A ) * mRNA were electrophoresed and then blotted onto nylon membranes .
The membranes were hybridized with a P-labeled hVDR cDNA probe , stripped , and rehybridized with a P-labeled human 24-hydroxylase cDNA probe and finally stripped and rehybridized with a P-labeled 195-base pair PCR product complementary to sequences of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) mRNA .
Lanes 1-4 , U937 cells : unstimulated ( Zane 1 ) , + 100 units/ml IL-4 ( lane 2 ) , + 5 x 10° m 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , ( lane 3 ) , + 100 units/ml IL-4 + 5 x 10 % m 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , ( lane 4 ) .

activation antigens , including major histocompatibility complex class II ( 63 ) and CD23 ( 23 ) .
Furthermore , recent observations of IL-4 effect on osteoclast development ( 64 , 65 ) , and the capacity of 1,25- ( OH ) , D , to directly up-regulate IL-4 receptors ( 66 ) , link this lymphokine with the vitamin D , endocrine sys-tem .
Additional evidence supporting the induction of VDR in B cells was obtained by the immunochemical detection of VDR protein .
Immunoprecipitated cross-reactive proteins obtained from activated B cell extracts demonstrated an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of VDR protein derived from activated T cells and U937 cells .
Furthermore , the cross-reactive proteins derived from activated B cells which exhibit reduced electrophoretic mobility may be indicative of occupied VDR that has undergone phosphorylation ( 57 ) .
The fact that binding of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , to its receptor and receptor phosphorylation are temporally related events ( 57 , 67 ) provides suggestive evidence for initial hormone-receptor complex formation in human B cells .
As an indicator of cellular action induced by 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D ; , we analyzed the induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA , as well as induction of hormone metabolism and the generation of vitamin D , metabolites .
In agreement with previous studies ( 58 , 59 ) , we observed a strict requirement for 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , for expression of 24-hydroxylase mRNA , emphasizing the regulatory control of its genomic transcription as an excellent tool for analysis of hormone-mediated cellular effect .
Our observation of a failure to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA in either activated normal or EBV-immortalized B cells was corroborated by analysis of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , metabolism , in that we were unable to detect 1,24 ( R ) ,25- ( OH ) , D , or other known metabolites of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , from these cells .
These observations are particularly intriguing with respect to the putative regulatory role of self-induced metabolism of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , ; as a mechanism to limit Response of Human B Lymphocytes to 1 @ ,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D , the responsiveness of target tissues ( 68 ) .
As it has been proposed that metabolism of the hormone provides a negative feedback on cellular responsiveness to 1 @ « ,25- ( OH ) , D , , one would expect that following VDR up-regulation , a lack of metabolic activity would initiate an enhanced bioresponsiveness .
On the contrary , we observed in B cells a refractory response to both 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , metabolism and 1,25- ( 0O0H ) , D , effect on cellular function .
It would appear that in B cells a hormone-receptor complex is assembled but that it does not participate in hormone-mediated gene regulation .
This could occur through the action of negative regulatory factor ( s ) that impede the VDR-1 @ ,25- ( OH ) , D , complex binding to the VDRE or negating the action of the complex once it is bound to the VDRE .
Recent evidence has suggested that VDRE may exist as at least three functionally distinct classes , responsive to either 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; alone via VDR/VDR homodimer formation , to 1,25- ( OH ) , D , ; and 9-cis-retinoic acid as VDR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers , or to 1,25- ( OH ) , D , ; and all-trans-retinoic acid as VDR/retinoic acid receptor heterodimers ( 69 , 70 ) .
It has been postulated that a given responsive gene can be regulated by up to six separate hormone response pathways that are governed by the ligands 1,25- ( 0H ) , D ; , all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA acting individually , or by the three binary combinations .
In the presence of only a single ligand , the responsive target gene may be activated only moderately , whereas addition of a second or third ligand would correspondingly induce a greater maximal response ( 70 ) .
Whatever the case , our studies clearly demonstrate that in T lymphocytes and U937 cells , treatment with 1 @ « ,25- ( 0H ) , D , was both necessary and sufficient to up-regulate expression of the 24-hydroxylase gene .
In contrast , B lymphocytes ( either normal or EBV-immortalized ) were incapable of up-regulating the 24-hydroxylase gene .
Furthermore , treatment of U937 cells with 1,25- ( OH ) , D , was sufficient to inhibit expression of the CD23b gene ; this effect was not observed in B lymphocytes .
Experiments are currently underway to determine whether this functional block in B lymphocytes can be ascribed to aberrant complex assembly .
Taken together , these results indicate a functional block for 1a,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated gene regulation in normal and EBV-immortalized B cells .
We believe that the components and events critical for 1 « ,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated gene regulation can be identified and molecularly characterized by direct comparison between B cells and hormone-responsive T cells and mono cytes .
