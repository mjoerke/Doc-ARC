Steitz , Yale University , New Haven , CT , January 16 , 1997 ( received for review December 2 , 1996 ) ABSTRACT LR1 is a B cell-specific , sequence-specific DNA binding activity that regulates transcription in activated B cells .
LR1 also binds Ig heavy chain switch region sequences and may function in class switch recombination .
LR1 contains two polypeptides , of 106 kDa and 45 kDa , and here we report that the 106-kDa component of LR1 is nucleolin .
This iden-tification , initially made by microsequence analysis , was verified by showing that ( ? )
LR1-DNA binding activity increased in B cells transfected with a nucleolin cDNA expression construct ; ( ii ) LR1-DNA binding activity was recognized by antibodies raised against recombinant human nucleolin ; and ( iii ) in B cells transfected with epitope-tagged nucleolin expression constructs , the LR1-DNA complex was recognized by the anti-tag antibody .
Nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar protein which is believed to play a role in rDNA transcription or organization , or rRNA processing .
Homology between nucleolin and histone H1 suggests that nucleolin may alter DNA organization in response to cell cycle controls , and the nucleolin component of LR1 may therefore function to organize switch regions before , during , or after switch recombination .
The demonstration that nucleolin is a component of a B cell-specific complex that binds switch region sequences suggests that the G-rich switch regions may have evolved from rDNA .
LR1 is a B cell-specific , sequence-specific DNA binding activity .
It was first identified as a factor that specifically recognizes Ig switch region sequences and is induced in primary B cells activated to carry out class switch recombination ( 1 , 2 ) .
LR1 has also been shown to regulate transcription of two genes that function in B cell transformation , c-myc ( 3 ) and the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA-1 gene ( 4 ) .
In Ig switch recombination , one constant region is literally switched for another by joining a rearranged and expressed variable region to a downstream constant region , deleting a long region of intervening DNA .
Switching involves repetitive , G-rich regions of DNA , called switch regions ( S regions ) , that are found upstream of the constant regions that undergo switch recombination ( 5-7 ) .
A specific S region is targeted for recombination by induction of noncoding transcripts from a promoter upstream of that S region ( 8-14 ) , and recombination depends on both transcription and splicing of these switch transcript ( 15 ) .
Since S region transcription is prerequisite to recombination , it is possible that LR1 binding to sites in the S regions might potentiate S region transcription and thereby activate recombination .
In vitro DNA binding studies have shown that the LR1-DNA binding consensus , GGNC-NAG ( G/C ) JCTG ( G/A ) , is loose , and LR1 may bind multiple The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

3605 sites in each of the G-rich S regions .
This suggests that another possible function for LR1 could be to organize S region DNA before , during , or after recombination .
To understand the function of LR1 , we have purified and characterized the activity .
LR1 is a complex of two polypeptides , of 106 kDa and 45 kDa ( 2 , 16 ) .
In this communication we demonstrate that the 106-kDa polypeptide component of LR1 is nucleolin .
Nucleolin is an abundant and highly modified protein found in nucleoli , the centers of ribosome biogenesis ( 17-22 ) .
Its N terminus is homologous to histone H1 , and like many RNA-binding proteins , nucleolin contains both RNA recognition motifs ( RRM ) and Arg-Gly-Gly ( RGG ) motifs ( see Fig .
1 ) .
The similarity between nucleolin and histone H1 has suggested that one role of nucleolin in the nucleolus may be to determine rDNA architecture ( 23 , 24 ) ; and nucleolin may function analogously in switching , organizing S region DNA before , during , or after recombination in response to cell cycle controls .
Nucleolin has also been thought to regulate rDNA expression ; and the results we report provide the first conclusive evidence for participation of nucleolin in a transcription factor .
Finally , the observation that nucleolin is a component of a factor that binds specifically to S regions suggests that S regions and rDNA are evolutionarily related .
This possibility is in accord with early reports of sequence homology between rDNA and portions of the Ig heavy chain locus ( 25 ) and with functional studies showing that rDNA may have special properties in recombination ( 26-28 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of LR1 .
LR1 was purified from the human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line , Raji .
Nuclear extract ( 29 ) from 40 L of cells was incubated with 20 ng/ml of biotinylated duplex DNA carrying the §y1 LR1 binding site ( 1 ) and , as nonspecific competitor , 2 ug/ml sonicated , boiled Escherichia coli DNA , in buffer L containing 0.2 M KCl ; protein-DNA complexes were captured on streptavidin aga-rose ( 30 ) ; and protein was eluted with 0.6 M KCL in buffer L ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.5/2 mM EDTA/10 % glycerol/1 mM DTT/1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/10 pg/ml leupep-tin/5 ug/ml benzamidine/5 pg/ml pepstatin A/5 pg/ml apro-tinin ) .
The eluate was dialyzed in buffer L containing 0.1 M KCl and chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose using a gradient of 0.1-1.0 M KC in buffer L. Fractions with LR1-DNA binding activity eluted between 0.45-0.6 M KCI and contained 106 kDa and 45 kDa polypeptides , as observed previously ( 2 ) .
The 106-kDa species was isolated by preparative SDS/PAGE and submitted in the gel slice to the W. M. Keck Foundation , Yale Medical School , where proteolysis with endoprotease lys C and peptide sequence analysis were carried out .
Aware that nucleolin might copurify as a contaminant , we generated Abbreviations : CMV , cytomegalovirus ; S region , switch region ; RRM , RNA recognition motif ; HA , hemagglutinin .

highly purified LR1 from the murine pre-B cell line , PD31 .
Attempts to remove nucleolin in the first purification step by DEAE chromatography resulted in loss of more than 90 % of LR1-DNA binding activity , suggesting that , at least in nuclear extracts , nucleolin may contribute to the stability of the LR1-DNA binding activity .
Instead , nuclear extract ( 31 ) from 40 L of cells was fractioned first on Heparin Hi-Trap ; then by oligonucleotide capture , as described above ; then on Mono Q ( Pharmacia ) , using a 0.05-1.0 M NaCl gradient .
Activity assays and immunoblotting showed that most ( 90 % ) of the LR1-DNA binding activity flowed through Mono Q , while most ( > 95 % ) of the nucleolin eluted at 0.4 M NaCl , as reported by others ( 32 ) .
The flow-through from the Mono Q column was then subjected to Mono S chromatography , using a 0.05-1.0 M NaCl gradient , and binding activity eluted at about 0.33 M NaCl .
At this point the preparation was estimated to be at least 12,000-fold purified .
The purified preparation , which specifically bound to duplex DNA carrying an LR1 site DNA ( K4 ~ 5 X 10- ! ° M ) , contained polypeptides of 106 kDa and 45 kDa .
Immunoblotting showed the 106-kDa polypeptide to be nucleolin .
The 45-kDa species was not recognized by antinucleolin antibodies and is a distinct polypeptide species ( unpublished work ) .
Constructs and Transfections .
Nucleolin constructs were generated from a human nucleolin cDNA clone , generously provided by M. Srivastava ( 22 ) , which we subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBS/KS* ( Stratagene ) to create pBSNuc .
For production of recombinant protein in £ .
coli , an Nrul/MscI fragment was deleted from pBSNuc , leaving residues 284-709 of nucleolin , which was then cloned as an EcoRI fragment into the pMalc2 vector ( New England Biolabs ) to create pMalNuc .
To express nucleolin under control of the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter , the Xbal/EcoRV fragment from pBSNuc was ligated into Spel pCMV2R to generate pNFor4 ; pCMV2R is a derivative of pCMV B ( CLONTECH ) into which the NofI/Rseal fragment of the pBS/KS* polylinker has been inserted at the NotI site .

The tagged cDNA was cloned as an Xbel/EcoRV fragment into pCMV2R to create pNtagd4 .
All PCR-generated regions in clones were sequenced throughout their length .
PD31 murine pre-B cells were transfected with Qiagen ( Chats-worth , CA ) purified plasmid , as described ( 33 ) .
Nuclear extracts were made 40-48 hr later by extraction with 1 M KCI ( 31 ) and protein concentration measured by Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) .
Expression of the HA tag was confirmed by immunoblots of transfected cell extracts using the HA tag-specific mAb , 12CAS .
Antibodies , Immunofluorescent Staining , and Immunoblot-ting .
Antinucleolin antibodies were raised against a maltose binding protein fusion protein containing amino acids 284-709 of human nucleolin , which corresponds to the RRM and RGG domains ( see Fig .
1 ) .
Extract was treated with 20 units/ml micrococcal nuclease and 10 ug/ml RNase A , then purified by successive steps of DEAE chromatography , amylose resin ( New England Biolabs ) affinity chromatography , and ion exchange chromatography on Mono S. New Zealand White rabbits were hyperimmunized with purified and denatured protein ( 100 ug/injection ) , and serum antibodies were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography on Hi-Trap protein A Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) , and concentrated on Centricon ( Amicon ) .
Immunofluorescent staining and immunoblotting were carried out as described by Li et al .
( 34 ) using anti-nucleolin antiserum at 1:50 dilution .
The mAb 12CA5 , specific for the HA epitope was prepared as high titer ascites fluid .
DNA Mobility-Shift Analysis .
Binding to a synthetic duplex oligonucleotide carrying the LR1 §y1 site was assayed by DNA mobility-shift , as described ( 1 ) .
Assays of crude nuclear extract contained 1 ug of protein per lane , and assays of purified LR1 contained ~1 ng protein per lane .
Gel shift assays used from 0-2 ug of purified rabbit serum antibodies or 1 ul 12CAS ascites fluid .
Quantification of band intensity was carried out using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager .
RESULTS Microsequence Analysis Shows the 106-kDa Component of LR1 to be Nucleolin , a 709-aa Polypeptide .
The 106-kDa band in the preparation of LR1 purified from Raji cells was digested with endoprotease lys C , and two sequenced peptides were found to be identical to predicted lysyl peptides of human nucleolin ( 22 ) , peptide 1 to residues 523-536 and peptide 2 to residues 610-623 .
LR1-DNA binding activity is B cell specific .
To ask if there might be a B cell-specific form of nucleolin , we isolated and sequenced 9 B cell nucleolin cDNAs .
These clones all carried 9 nucleotide not present in the published sequence of nucleolin from a human retinal cDNA library ( 22 ) .
Rese-quencing the human retinal nucleolin cDNA clone ( 22 ) showed that a small region , encoding amino acid residues 624-626 , had been omitted from the published sequence .
The corrected sequence of the predicted human nucleolin polypeptide is shown in Fig .
14 , and the corresponding domains of the nucleolin polypeptide in Fig .
1B .
We found no evidence for B cell-specific , alternatively spliced forms of nucleolin .
Nucleolin is an abundant protein , and it was possible that it might have copurified as a contaminant in the LR1 prepara-tion .
The oligonucleotide affinity chromatography step is of particular concern because others have observed nucleolin or nucleolin fragments in protein preparations purified by affinity chromatography using G-rich telomeric DNA sequences ( 35 ) .
Another preparation of LR1 was generated , from a murine pre-B cell line , purified 12,000-fold by four steps of column chromatography and demonstrated to contain nucleolin by Biochemistry : Hanakahi et al .

immunoblotting ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Both the degree of purification and the relatively high salt used in chromato-graphic elution steps made it unlikely that nucleolin was a contaminant or was only weakly associated with the binding complex .
We therefore set about to demonstrate as rigorously as possible that nucleolin is indeed a component of the LR1-DNA binding complex .
Recognition of LR1 by Polyclonal Antinucleolin Antibodies Generates a `` Subshifted '' Complex in Native Gels .
We raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of recombinant human nucleolin ( residues 284-709 ) .
As anti-DNA antibodies in the serum would interfere with gel mobility-shift assays of LR1 activity , the protein used for immunization was purified to homogeneity from nuclease-treated cell extract .
The antibodies , purified by protein A affinity chromatography , specifically recognized nucleoli in immunofluorescent staining ( Fig .
24 ) .
They also specifically recognized the 106-kDa nucleolin polypeptide in PD31 cell nuclear extract , as shown by immunoblotting ( Fig .
2B ) .
Recognition of LR1I-DNA binding activity by the antinucleolin antibodies was tested by gel mobility-shift .
Interaction of antibodies with a DNA binding protein typically has one of two effects on formation of a protein-DNA complex : the antibodies may inhibit binding , in which case no shifted band Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 94 ( 1997 ) 3607 is evident ; or the antibodies may further retard the mobility of the protein-DNA complex , producing a highly retarded band referred to as a supershift .
As shown in Fig .
3 , treatment of LR1 with the anti-nucleolin antibodies neither inhibited binding nor caused a supershift .
Instead , the antibodies increased the mobility of the LR1-DNA complex , producing a `` sub-shift . ''
Both crude extract ( Fig .
34 ) and highly purified LR1 ( Fig .
3B ) treated with the anti-nucleolin antibodies displayed an identical subshift , while antibodies from pre-immune serum had no effect on complex mobility .
Several trivial explanations for the subshift can be ruled out .
The subshift can not be accounted for by anti-DNA activity of the antibodies , because migration of the labeled DNA duplex was not altered by incubation with the antibodies in the absence of LR1 activity ( Fig .
3B Right ) .
The subshift is unlikely to result from proteolysis , as the antibodies had been affinity purified on protein A , which should remove contaminating proteases ; and antibodies from pre-immune serum had no effect on complex mobility either in crude extract ( Fig .
34 ) or highly purified protein preparations ( Fig .
3B ) ; and the antinucleolin antibodies had no effect on other protein-DNA interactions , including those of Sp1 and Ku ( not shown ) .
The subshift is not peculiar to a single antibody preparation , as serum from two different hyperimmunized rabbits produced a similar subshift .
One explanation for the subshift could be that interaction with antibodies alters the mobility of the binding complex to make it migrate faster .
If so , there would be rabbit antibodies in the subshifted complex , and addition of anti-rabbit Ig to the binding complex should further alter complex mobility .
We tested this possibility by treating purified LR1 with rabbit antinucleolin antibodies in the presence of anti-rabbit Ig .
We tested both anti-rabbit IgM and anti-rabbit-Ig ( all isotypes ) , in reactions that contained 1 or 5 ug of affinity-purified antirabbit Ig and 2 ug of serum antibodies from a rabbit immunized with recombinant nucleolin .
As shown in Fig .
3C , even at 2.5-fold excess over rabbit serum antibodies , the anti-rabbit IgM or IgG antibodies had no effect on the mobility of the subshift .
The most likely explanation for the subshift therefore appears to be that the antinucleolin antibodies remove nucleolin from the DNA binding complex , leaving the remainder of the complex in contact with the DNA .

Further experiments , described below , are consistent with this interpretation of the LR1 subshift .
Anti-Tag Antibodies Supershift Epitope-Tagged Nucleolin in the LR1-DNA Binding Complex .
The sensitivity to antinucleolin antibodies illustrated in Fig .
3 shows that nucleolin , or a protein that shares epitopes with nucleolin , is present in the LR1-DNA binding complex .
To determine whether the polypeptide recognized by the antibodies is bona fide nucleolin or a related protein , we transfected the murine pre-B cell line , PD31 , with constructs in which the CMV promoter drives expression of either an unmodified nucleolin cDNA ( pNFor4 ) , or a nucleolin cDNA carrying an HA epitope tag at the amino terminus ( pNtag4 ) .
Extracts were assayed for LR1-DNA binding activity by gel mobility-shift .
Transfection with either pNtagd4 ( Fig .
44 ) or pNFor4 ( not shown ) resulted in a 4-fold increase in LR1-DNA binding activity .
Treatment with the anti-tag mAb , 12CAS , did not alter the mobility of shifted bands produced by nuclear extracts from cells transfected with the untagged construct , pNFor4 ( Fig .
4B Left ) , but when nuclear extracts from cells transfected with pNtag4 were incubated with this antibody prior to the gel shift assay , the mobility of the protein-DNA complex was retarded ( Fig .
4B Center ) .
Only a fraction of the complexed DNA was super-shifted , presumably because the tagged construct encodes only a fraction of the nucleolin in the LR1-DNA complex .
Sur-prisingly , treatment of HA-tagged LR1 with the anti-tag monoclonal results in an increase in the amount of DNA bound by the protein .
This is a reproducible effect of treating tagged LR1 with the 12CAS mAb .
One possible explanation is that interaction with the antibody increases affinity of LR1 for DNA .
Control lanes ( Fig .
4B Right ) show that , in the absence of nuclear extract , the anti-tag antibody did not alter the mobility of the free labeled DNA duplex .
We conclude that LR1-DNA binding activity contains bona fide nucleolin .

USA 94 ( 1997 ) The HA epitope encoded by pNtagd4 is at residue 4 of the N terminus of nucleolin .
The observation that anti-tag antibodies recognize the LR1-DNA complex suggests that the N terminus of nucleolin is exposed in this complex .
As shown in Fig .
1 , this region contains long acidic stretches , including repeats of glutamate and aspartate up to 38 residues in length .
Conceivably , these acidic regions within the N terminus might function as `` acid blobs '' and allow LR1 to activate transcription ( 3 , 4 ) by ionic interactions with the basal transcription apparatus ( 37 ) .
The Presence of Nucleolin in the LR1 Complex Diminishes Sequence Specificity of DNA Binding .
The experiments described above identify nucleolin as the 106-kDa component of LR1 .
As the 106-kDa polypeptide becomes covalently linked to DNA upon ultraviolet crosslinking ( 2 , 16 ) , nucleolin appears to make direct contact with DNA .
To probe the role of nucleolin in LR1I-DNA interaction , we assayed sequence-specificity of LR1 binding in the presence and absence of antinucleolin antibodies .
Mutations at most positions in the LR1 site , CCTCCTGGTCAAGGCTGAA , do not affect LR1 binding , but mutation of either of the two underlined G residues to A diminishes binding 10-fold or more ( ref .
1 ; and unpublished data ) .
These two Gs are at positions 8 and 14 of the binding site .
By replacing the underlined G residues with inosine or 2-aminopurine , we created a small panel of synthetic oligonucleotides that permitted us to analyze the specificity of LR1-DNA interactions .
Inosine differs from G in lacking the N functional group in the minor groove , and 2-aminopurine differs from G in lacking the O , group in the major groove .
Binding of the LR1 complex to DNA is diminished by substitution of 2-aminopurine , but not inosine , at G8 ; and by substitution of inosine but not 2-aminopurine at G14 ( Fig .
5 Leff ) .
When DNA binding was assayed in the presence of anti-nucleolin antibodies , binding to some of these oligonucleotides was altered ( Fig .
5 Right ) .
While binding to substitutions at position 14 was essentially unchanged , binding to GSI was somewhat reduced , and binding to G8-2AP was considerably reduced .
Removal of nucleolin from the binding complex therefore renders binding more sensitive to certain substitutions .
In the LR1 complex , nucleolin may relax stringency of DNA recognition and permit LR1 to bind S region DNA in a fashion that tolerates a greater degree of sequence heterogeneity .

Biochemistry : Hanakahi et al .
DISCUSSION LR1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein which regulates transcription in mammalian B cells and is likely also to function in switch recombination ( 1-4 ) .
LR1 contains two polypeptides , of 106 kDa and 45 kDa .
The 106-kDa component of LR1 is nucleolin .
What is the role of nucleolin in LR1-DNA binding ?
The 106-kDa nucleolin polypeptide in the LR1 complex contacts DNA , as shown by ultraviolet crosslinking ( 1 , 16 ) .
Nucleolin also affects sequence-specificity of DNA recognition , rendering binding less sensitive to certain substitutions .
The Ig S regions are composed of repetitive , G-rich sequences which conform to a loose consensus .
One function of nucleolin in LR1-DNA recognition may be to permit LR1 to bind a greater variety and number of sequences within the S regions .
Two results argue that nucleolin alone is not responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding by LR1 .
First , treatment of LR1 with antinucleolin antibodies depletes nucleolin from the complex without diminishing DNA binding .
Second , while a recombinant fusion protein expressing the C-terminal RRM and RGG domains of nucleolin can bind to duplex DNA carrying an LR1 site , binding is reduced by three orders of magnitude and does not exhibit the sequence-specificity characteristic of the LR1 complex ( unpublished data ) .
Others have identified nucleolin as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein ( 38 , 39 ) .
In contrast to our experiments , these reports were based only upon microsequence analysis of purified protein and were not supported with evidence showing that antinucleolin antibodies recognized the DNA binding activity under investigation .
As nucleolin is a very abundant protein , which could readily copurify as a contaminant , the significance of these reports is not clear .
It has also been reported that recombinant nucleolin can interact with long subcloned fragments from the S regions ( 40 ) .
However , in these experiments DNA binding was assayed by Southwestern blotting and binding affinity was not reported .
The primary sequence and predicted structural motifs of nucleolin ( Fig .
1 ) may provide clues relevant to the function of the LR1 complex in transcription and in recombination .
The N terminus of nucleolin contains long acidic stretches , including three uninterrupted runs of 16 , 21 and 38 amino acid residues , which could function as `` acid blobs '' ( 37 ) to regulate transcription .
The N terminus is homologous to histone H1 and contains nine TPXKK motifs which are sites for phosphorylation by edc2 kinase .
Mitosis-specific phosphorylation of H1 at these sites is thought to facilitate chromosome condensation ; and in the nucleolus , nucleolin is thought to enhance condensation of the actively transcribed rDNA at mitosis ( 23 , 24 ) .
Nucleolin may organize the structure of the actively transcribed S regions in an analogous fashion , responding to cell cycle-specific controls before , during or after recombination .
The central region of nucleolin is composed of four consensus RRMs ( or RBDs ) , conserved domains of 90-100 amino acids that form B-sheet structures ( reviewed in refs .
41 and 42 ) .
The RRMs are thought to provide a platform for protein-RNA contact , and the RNA exposed upon this platform is likely to be available for interaction .
In LR1 , the of nucleolin could function in interaction either with S region DNA or with the S region transcripts that are essential to recombination .
The C terminus of nucleolin contains RGG motifs , also common in RNA binding proteins , which have been implicated in nucleolar localization ( 32 , 43 ) , RNA binding and RNA helix-destabilization ( 44 ) .
RGG motifs in other RRM-containing proteins have been shown to facilitate pro-tein-mediated interactions of both RNA and DNA in vitro ( 45-48 ) , a function of obvious utility in a polypeptide component of a complex that functions in recombination .
In LR1 , protein-protein interaction mediated by the C-terminal regions could juxtapose regions of DNA bound to protein .
Taken Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 94 ( 1997 ) 3609 together , these properties are consistent with a picture in which LR1 binds to multiple sites in each activated S region , and functions to organize S region DNA for transcription , recombination , or both .
LR1-DNA binding activity is B cell-specific , but nucleolin is ubiquitous .
What accounts for the cell type-specificity of LR1 activity ?
Alternative processing of nucleolin mRNA could in principle provide a mechanism for cell type-specific modification of nucleolin , but we have not found evidence of alternative processing of the mRNA .
Moreover , as tagged nucleolin expressed from a full-length cDNA clone appears in the LR1 shift , it is unlikely that alternative processing of nucleolin is key to producing this B cell-specific DNA binding activity .
LR1I-DNA binding activity is dependent on phosphorylation ( 2 ) , which may regulate cell type-specificity .
Nucleolin is known to be phosphorylated , N-glycosylated , and to contain dimethylated arginine residues in the C-terminal RGGs ( 17-22 ) .
We are now investigating the possibility there is distinct posttranslational modification of the nucleolin in the LR1 complex .
Switch recombination is characteristic of the mammalian immune response , and it has not been observed in lower vertebrates .
This raises the question of how S regions and switch recombination evolved .
Sequence homologies have been reported between rDNA and regions within the Ig loci ( 25 ) , which may reflect a common origin or the G-rich base composition of both regions .
There is also functional evidence that rDNA sequences can play special roles in recombination ( 26-28 ) .
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the HOT1 hotspot for mitotic recombination proved to be identical to the rDNA promoter ( 26 ) .
In Drosophila , active rDNA recombination can magnify rDNA repeats in somatic cells ( 27 ) , and during meiosis the X and Y chromosomes pair in the vicinity of the nucleolus organizer-the rDNA .
X chromosomes that lack the pairing region segregate randomly , but this can be corrected by P element insertion of an rDNA gene into heterochromatin , and in flies carrying such insertions , X chromosome pairing occurs at the site of rDNA insertion ( 28 ) .
Our demonstration that nucleolin is one part of a complex that interacts with S regions suggests that this protein may have followed its cognate DNA as it moved from one function to another .
The G-rich rDNAs thus provide a plausible origin for the evolution of Ig S regions .
