RAPID COMMUNICATION Fas Ligation Induces Apoptosis and Jun Kinase Activation Independently of CD45 and Lock in Human T Celis By Kevin M. Latinis and Gary A. Koretzky Stimulation through the Fas/APO-1 receptor results in apoptosis through an incompletely characterized signaling pathway .
More is known regarding signal transduction events that occur after ligation of the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) .
It has been shown that TCR stimulation requires both the membrane tyrosine phosphatase , CD45 , and the Src-family kinase , Lok , to result in cellular activation .
Although prior studies suggest a role for protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in Fas signaling , we report here that Fas ligation induces apoptosis in T cells deficient in either CD45 or Lock .
Further , in normal and CD45- or Lok-deficient cell lines , Fas stimulation results in activation of Jun kinase ( JNK ) , a HE Fas ( APO-1 , CD95 ) surface receptor is known to be an important mediator of apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types .
`` * Apoptosis stimulated via Fas ligation is characterized by cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation .
`` * '' The physiologic importance of Fas is evident from both murine and human studies showing that mutations in Fas result in lymphoproliferative disorders and autoimmune disease . '' ''
Other studies also support the hypothesis that Fas plays a critical role in the process of immune peripheral tolerance . `` !
Yet , despite convincing data supporting the physiologic importance of Fas , relatively little is known regarding how Fas transmits its intracellular signals .
Fas is a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family . '' ''
It contains a cysteine-rich extracellular domain that mediates its binding to Fas Ligand** '' and an intracellular `` 'death domain '' required to promote cell death . '' ''
Although Fas lacks intrinsic catalytic activity , several reports have described Fas-associated proteins proposed to function as signaling intermediates . ''
Both protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) and protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase ) activity are indispensable for T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) mediated activation .
'** '' A recent study suggested that PTK and PTPase also participate in early signaling events mediated by Fas . ''
In this report , ligation of Fas was shown to result in a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylated proteins . ''
Additionally , Fas possesses a unique carboxy-terminal domain shown to be important for interactions with PTP-BAS ( FAP-1 ) , a tyrosine phosphatase whose expression appears to correlate with inhibition of Fas-mediated killing . ''
In this report we describe experiments designed to examine whether the protein tyrosine phosphatase , CD45 , or the Src-family protein tyrosine kinase , Lck , are required for Fas-induced apoptosis in the Jurkat leukemic T-cell line .
Our results indicate that neither CD45 nor Leck expression is required for Fas to couple with its signaling machinery in Jurkat T cells .
Several studies have suggested that Jun kinase may play a role in mediating the cytotoxic effects after TNF receptor ligation . ''
Additionally , both TNF and Fas receptor stimulation result in increased sphingomyelinase activity and subsequent intracellular ceramide release . '' ''
Synthetic ceramide analogs have been shown to induce apoptosis independently Blood , Vol 87 , No 3 ( February 1 ) , 1996 : pp 871-875 proposed mediator of stress activation pathways .
Previous studies have also demonstrated a role for endogenous ceramide release in Fas-mediated apoptosis .
We show that stimulation with a synthetic ceramide analog results in JNK activation as well as apoptosis , suggesting ceramide release occurs proximal to JNK activation in Fas signaling .
Our data suggest that although CD45 and Lock are not required for Fas signaling , JNK activation may play an important role transducing distal signals that lead to apoptosis after Fas ligation .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Jurkat , 145.01 , and JCaM.1 express equivalent amounts of Fas .
- The Jurkat T-lymphocyte leukemic cell line served as a model cell for all experiments in this study .
To investigate possible roles of CD45 and Lok in Fas signaling , experiments were performed using CD45- and Lek-deficient derivatives of Jurkat .
Relative surface expression of T-cell receptor , CD45 , and Fas was evaluated by FACS analysis ( Fig 1 ) .
All three cell lines expressed equivalent amounts of Fas and TCR .
In contrast , 145.01 cells expressed much less CD45 than either Jurkat or JCaM.1 cells .

To establish that the mechanism of death was indeed via apoptosis , we evaluated fragmentation of total cellular DNA into characteristic 200-bp concatamers .
The three cell types were stimulated as above followed by lysis and DNA precipitation .
DNA samples from unstimulated and Fas stimulated Jurkat , J45.01 , and JCaM.1 cells were then separated on a 1 % agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining ( Fig 2B ) .
We observed DNA fragmentation after Fas stimulation in all three cell types , establishing apoptosis as the mechanism of death .
Fas cross-linking results in JNK activation in Jurkat T cells .
Previous work has documented JNK activation in cellular responses to stimuli , including osmotic stress , '' '' treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors , '' and TNF-receptor stimulation .
`` `` '' * In an effort to elucidate potential signaling mechanisms and to confirm that CD45 and Lck were not required for Fas signaling pathways , we tested the ability of Fas stimulation to activate JNK in the three cell lines : Jurkat , 145.01 , and JCaM.1 .

C2-ceramide induces JNK activation in T cells .
Re-cently , others have reported a role for sphingomyelinase activation and subsequent ceramide release in Fas-mediated apoptosis .
`` `` '' '' * In an effort to establish a temporal relationship between ceramide release and JNK activation we used the synthetic ceramide analog , C2-ceramide , to stimulate Jurkat T cells .
C2-ceramide has been shown previously to promote apoptosis in T cells comparable to Fas ligation . ''
Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated for the indicated times with C2-ceramide or Fas MoAb or 30 minutes with sorbitol as a positive control .
JNK activity was determined as above .
As shown in Fig 4 , stimulation with ceramide analogs resulted in JNK activation with kinetics similar to Fas stimulation .
J45.01 and JCaM.1 cells also responded similarly to C2-ceramide stimulation by activating JNK and stimulating apoptosis ( data not shown ) .
Efficient signaling through the TCR requires CD45 and Lock to provide proximal tyrosine phosphorylation events leading to distal proliferative responses .
'* '' Several recent reports have suggested that protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases also function in regulating signaling events through the Fas surface receptor .
`` `` '' ° The present study was designed to test whether the tyrosine phosphatase , CD45 , and the lymphocyte-specific Sre family kinase , Lok , also are important for Fas-induced signals in T lymphocytes .
Our results show that CD45 and Lock are not required for Fas-induced apoptosis , suggesting that TCR proliferative signals and Fas apoptotic signals do not share all of the same proximal signaling mechanisms .
As others have reported , '' '' we observed that Fas stimulation of Jurkat results in some PTK activation ( data not shown ) .
However , in our hands the intensity and quantity of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was much lower than with TCR stimulation .
Interestingly , in both 145.01 and JCaM.1 Fas ligation resulted in no detectable changes in tyrosine phosphorylated proteins ( data not shown ) , even though apoptosis was similar to that seen with Jurkat .
Several recent reports have illustrated increases in JNK activity after stress activation , '' '' '' ' including treatment with TNF . ''
Our experiments similarly showed that JNK activity increases after Fas stimulation .

Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-Fas MoAb , C2-ceramide , or sorbitol , and JNK enzymatic activity was assessed as described in Fig 3 .
30 ' vation participates in the events directly inducing apoptosis requires further testing .
However , it is intriguing to speculate that Fas stimulation triggers a signaling cascade similar to previously described stress-induced pathways .
One known function of JNK is to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor c-Jun . ''
Although some reports demonstrate that Fas-mediated apoptosis does not require new protein synthesis , '' this does not rule out the possibility that transcriptional activation still participates in signaling apoptosis .
Experiments are currently in progress to test the significance of Fas-mediated JNK activation and whether transcriptional regulation may play a role in Fas killing .
In this report we show also that a synthetic ceramide analog can stimulate JNK activity with kinetics similar to Fas stimulation .
This observation , together with prior reports that Fas stimulates ceramide release , '' '' '' ' suggests that ceramide release may occur proximal to JNK activation in the Fas signaling cascade .
We are pursuing this finding in our effort to understand more fully the signaling events that occur linking Fas engagement with cellular death via apoptosis .
