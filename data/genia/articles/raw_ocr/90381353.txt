Interferon Affects Nuclear Proteins in Cells of Clinically Sensitive Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Patients By O.M .
Zack Howard , Moshe Talpaz , Hagop Kantarfjian , David Seong , Andrzej Wedrychowski , Nikolaos Paslidis , Jeane Hester , Anne Cork , James Turpin , Gabriel Lopez-Berestein , Jose Trujillo , Jordan Gutterman , Emil Freireich , and Albert Deisseroth Cytoplasmic protein extracts from chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) cells contained an activity that altered the electrophoretic mobility of complexes formed between nuclear proteins and the transcriptional enhancers of interferon ( IFN ) -inducible genes .
Exposure of CML cells to IFN- « diminished the effect of the CML cytoplasmic proteins on these nuclear protein-DNA complexes .
The pres N CHRONIC myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , an underlying defect in growth regulation related to the Philadelphia chromosome translocation leads to an accumulation of high numbers of myeloid cells .
The chronic or benign phase lasts a median of 4 years , following which the acquisition of additional mutations leads to a more acute form of leukemia in which the patients die of bleeding and infection . !
Alpha-interferon ( IFN-a @ ) induces complete hematologic remissions ( all cells are Philadelphia chromosome-positive , but the differential count and white blood cell count are normal ) in 70 % of patients and a complete cytogenetic remission ( all cells are diploid ) in 15 % of early phase CML patients . '
Fifteen percent to 30 % of early chronic phase CML patients show primary resistance to IFN-a at diagno-sis .
The mechanism through which IFN- « # mediates its clinical effect in CML and the reasons for these variable levels of sensitivity to IFN are unknown .
Alpha-interferon exerts its immunomodulatory and antiviral effects by activating the transcription of histocompatibility and antiviral genes .
It also alters the transcriptional activity of several other genes commonly known as IFN-inducible genes .
This transcriptional activation is mediated through alteration of nuclear proteins that bind to the 5 ' transcription-regulatory regions of IFN-inducible genes before the activation of gene expression .
** To test the hypothesis that the action of IFN-a in CML is also associated with changes in nuclear DNA-binding proteins , we isolated nuclear proteins from CML patients who were either clinically resistant or sensitive to IFN- .
We then studied the electrophoretic mobility of the complexes formed between these nuclear proteins and IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers .
The transcriptional enhancers used were taken from the 5 ' region of the IFN antiviral gene 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase ( 2,5-0AS8 ) , * '' the IFN immunomodulatory gene beta-2 microglobulin , ' and the IFN-inducible genes 9-27 '' and 6-16 , ° which are of unknown function . ''
We found that the electrophoretic mobility of complexes between the IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers and the nuclear proteins isolated from the unfractionated peripheral blood cells of CML and normal individuals were different before IFN exposure .
The complexes formed by nuclear proteins isolated from unfractionated normal peripheral blood cells resembled those formed by nuclear proteins from unfractionated CML peripheral blood cells after the Blood , Vol 76 , No 6 ( September 15 ) , 1990 : pp 1117-1130 ence of clinical responsiveness to IFN- « correlated with the sensitivity to the IFN-induced change in the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-DNA complexes .
These data suggest that the action of IFN-a in CML may be linked to a pathway that can result in posttranslational modification of nuclear proteins .

nuclear proteins from normal peripheral blood cells were exposed to a phosphatase-like activity found in cytoplasmic proteins of CML myeloid cells .
Alpha-interferon treatment changed the electrophoretic mobility pattern of complexes formed by nuclear proteins of CML peripheral blood to that of normal peripheral blood cells .
This IFN-induced change occurred in CML patients who were known to be clinically sensitive to IFN-a but did not occur in CML patients who were clinically resistant to IFN-a .
MATERIALS AND METHODS In vitro and in vivo use of alpha-interferon .
Patients were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of 5 to 10 x 10° U of IFN-a .
In vitro experiments involved the use of 1,000 U/mL of recombinant IFN-a at 37°C at pH 7.4 for 1 hour .
The concentration used for in vitro experiments ( 1,000 U/mL ) is four times the peak serum level usually seen 2 hours after a subcutaneous injection of 5 x 10° U of recombinant IFN-a .
The peripheral blood samples used for this study were obtained as incidental samples from routine diagnostic or response evaluation procedures approved by the M.D .
Anderson Surveillance Commit-tee .
Some of the samples from CML patients `` off of IFN '' ( patient not receiving IFN at time sample was taken ) were obtained at diagnosis before institution of therapy , while all of the samples from CML patients receiving IFN were obtained at variable time points after initiation of IFN therapy .
The time after initiation of therapy at which these samples were obtained is indicated in Table 4 ( see Results ) .
This is primarily a retrospective study in that the majority of samples were obtained after the response status was known .

The area at the bottom of the lane shows the free probe .
Patients chosen for this study were those in whom the responsiveness to IFN could be determined from the clinical history .
Patients responding to a combination of IFN-a and chemotherapy were excluded from analysis in Table 4 as their sensitivity to IFN-a as a single agent was incvaluable .
The analysis and interpretation of the electrophoretic mobility analysis of nuclear protein DNA complexes were performed by individuals unfamiliar with the IFN response status .
Mobility-shift analysis .
Nuclear proteins were isolated from peripheral blood cells or cell lines by the method of Miskimens et al ' '' or by the method of Dignam et al . ''
The mobility-shift assay was performed as described by Treisman , '' except that the binding buffer contained 120 mmol/L NaCl , 10 mmol/L Tris , pH 7.5 , 20 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol , 1 mmol/L ethylenediamine tetraacetate , 4 % glycerol , and 0.1 % Triton X-100 .
All protein-binding assays were performed after the unfractionated nuclear proteins ( 2 to 12 ug ) had been incubated with a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL of poly ( dl ) poly ( dC ) for 15 minutes at 4°C .
The nuclear proteins were then exposed for 1 hour at 4°C to 100 fmol or 10° cpm of the transcription enhancer oligonucleotide , which was `` P end-labeled by the Klenow reaction .
The nuclear protein-DNA complexes were electrophoresed in a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel at 5 V/cm for 12 hours in a Tris-acetate buffer .
Quantitation of the high- and low-mobility complexes was made by scanning densitometry .

1120 the electrophoretic mobility of complexes formed between nuclear proteins and IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers .
The nuclear proteins of normal monocytoid cells fraction-ated from normal peripheral blood cells form a high-mobility complex ( Fig la ) with the transcriptional enhancers of the IFN-inducible gene 2,5-0AS .
The nuclear proteins from normal peripheral blood lymphoid cells form a low-mobility complex ( Fig la ) .
The nuclear proteins isolated from lymphoid cell lines ( Fig 1b ) form a low-mobility complex with the 2,5-0AS IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancer , while the nuclear proteins of myeloid cell lines form a high-mobility complex ( Fig 1b ) .
The nuclear proteins of lymphoid and myeloid cells formed low- or high-mobility complexes , respectively , with the IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers ( Table 1 ) of the beta-2 microglobulin and the 6-16 , 9-27 , and 2,5-0AS genes ( Fig 1C ) .
Nuclear proteins from monocytoid cell lines formed high-mobility complexes , whereas nuclear proteins from erythroid cells ( HEL , K562 , OCIM-2 ) formed low-mobility complexes .
The mRNA levels of the 2,5-0A¥S , 6-16 , and 9-27 genes have been shown to be IFN-inducible in myeloid as well as lymphoid cells in our own laboratory as well as in those of others . ''
Sequence specificity of nuclear protein binding assay .
We incubated nuclear proteins from the HL60 cell line , which forms both the high- and low-mobility complex , with the P Klenow end-labeled 2,5-O0AS 5 ' transcriptional enhancer oligonucleotide ( Table 1 ; Fig 2 , lane 21 ) in the presence or absence of unlabeled oligonucleotides that were homologous or nonhomologous to the P-labeled 2,5-0AS oligonucleotide .
When we added a 50- or 100-fold molar excess of a 2,5-OAS transcriptional enhancer oligonucleotide itself ( Fig 2 , lanes 17 and 18 ) , we observed almost complete inhibition of binding of nuclear proteins to the P-labeled oligonucleotide .
Addition of a 50-fold excess of a region further 5 ' to the 2,5-0AS transcriptional enhancer ( Fig 2 , lanes 19 and 20 ) , which contained regions homologous to the `` P-labeled 2,5-0AS transcriptional enhancer , also led to inhibition of binding .
When we added a 50- or a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides that were not homologous ( Fig 2 , lanes 1 through 4 and 7 through 12 ) , no reduction in the binding of nuclear proteins to the P-labeled oligonucleotide occurred .
Addition of oligonucleotides containing elements that exhibited homology to the 2,5-0AS transcriptional enhancer oligonucleotide showed inhibition of binding of the P-labeled 2,5-0AS oligonucleotide ( Fig 2 , lanes 5 , 6 , and 13 through 20 ) .
These experiments demonstrate that the binding of nuclear proteins to DNA is sequence-specific under the conditions of our experiments .
Complexes formed between the interferon-inducible transcriptional enhancers and nuclear proteins extracted from chronic myelogenous leukemia and normal cells before interferon exposure are different .
Nuclear proteins extracted from the unfractionated normal peripheral blood cells of all 18 normal donors tested formed both a low-mobility complex and a high-mobility complex with the 2,5-O0AS oligonucleotide ( Table 2 ; Fig 3a ) .
HOWARD ET AL The nuclear proteins isolated from unfractionated peripheral blood cells of all 44 CML patients tested ( see patient data in Table 3 and lane 1 of Figs 3b and 3¢ ) formed the high-mobility complex .
The low-mobility complex was undetectable in 40 of the 44 untreated CML samples tested ( see Tables 2 and 3 and lane 1 of Figs 3b and 3¢c ) .
The low-mobility complex was undetectable even when 20 % of the peripheral blood cells were lymphoid ( patients no .
6 , 25 , 32 , and 36 in Table 3 ) .
In vivo exposure to alpha-interferon alters the complexes formed between interferon-inducible transcriptional enhancers and nuclear proteins .
- We then studied the in vivo effect of IFN- « on the electrophoretic mobility of complexes formed between nuclear proteins isolated from the unfractionated peripheral blood cells of CML patients and IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers .
The CML patients we studied exhibited the following different clinical response patterns to IFN-a , which indicate different levels of sensitivity to IFN-a : complete or partial hematologic remissions ( Table 4 ) , partial cytogenetic remissions ( Table 5 ) , complete cytogenetic remissions ( Table 6 ) , primary or de novo resistance defined as failure of IFN to decrease the white blood cell count to below 20,000/mm* in 3 months of therapy ( Table 7 ) , and secondary resistance ( the loss of hematologic or cytogenetic remission ) while receiving IFN- ( Table 7 ) .
The patients were usually treated 3 to 6 months before the response status was defined .
Interferon antibodies were ruled out as a cause of clinical resistance in all resistant patients included in this study .
As shown in lane 2 of Fig 3b , when the nuclear proteins were extracted from the unfractionated peripheral blood cells of IFN-sensitive CML patients during IFN therapy , both low- and high-mobility complexes were detected in 10 of Table 2 .

complexes formed by the nuclear proteins before ( Fig 4a , lane 3 ) and after ( Fig 4a , lane 4 ) in vitro exposure to IFN , this resulted in an increase in the intensity of the low-mobility complex ( band A in lane 4 of Fig 4A ) .
The blood sample of the same IFN-sensitive CML patient exposed in vivo to IFN-a ( Fig 4a , lanes 1 and 2 ) before ( lane 1 ) and after ( lane 2 ) in vitro exposure to IFN- , was taken 12 to 14 hours after the daily subcutaneous dose of IFN-a .
The serum level of a subcutaneous dose of 5 x 10° U/mL reaches a peak of 250 U/mL in the serum 2 hours after injection .
Thus , the intensity of the low-mobility complex seen in lane 1 of Fig 4a is less than that seen in lanes 2 or 4 of Fig 4a following in vitro exposure to 1,000 U IFN- « .
No change in the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-DNA complexes was seen when the cells of IFN-resistant CML patients were exposed in vitro to IFN before nuclear protein isolation ( Fig 4b ) .
The IFN-induced change in nuclear protein-DNA complex mobility , which was seen in cells of IFN-sensitive CML patients , did not require de novo protein synthesis , as the addition of cycloheximide in vitro to the peripheral blood cells of a CML patient before the cells were exposed to IFN did not prevent IFN-induced changes in nuclear protein complexes ( Fig 4¢ , lane 3 ) .
Cytoplasmic protein of chronic myelogenous leukemia myeloid cells alters nuclear protein complexes .
If lymphocytes were first purified from the myeloid cells present in CML peripheral blood before cell lysis and nuclear protein isolation , a low-mobility complex was formed between the IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers and the nuclear proteins of the lymphoid cells ( Fig 5 ) .
These data suggested that there was an activity in the peripheral blood myeloid cells of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML cells that was released at the time of cell lysis and altered in vitro the nuclear proteins of lymphoid cells .
To directly test this hypothesis , we added a small amount of cytoplasmic protein of the peripheral blood myeloid cells of an IFN-sensitive CML patient to the nuclear proteins of an established lymphoid cell line ( Daudi ) .
We have previously shown that the electrophoretic mobility of the complex formed between the IFN-inducible enhancer and the nuclear proteins of normal lymphoid cells or established lymphoid cell lines was identical .
The addition of the CML cytoplasmic protein caused a reduction in the intensity of the low-mobility complex and the formation of a more rapidly migrating complex ( Fig 6a ) .
The mobility of this more rapidly migrating complex was similar to that of the complexes formed by nuclear proteins of CML cells .

changes occurred when the peripheral blood cells of an IFN-resistant CML patient were used to generate a cytoplasmic extract ( Fig 6b ) .
However , almost no change was seen when the cytoplasmic proteins of the peripheral blood cells of a normal individual were used to generate the cytoplasmic extract or when the mature marrow cells ( bands and neutrophils ) of a normal individual were used to generate the cytoplasmic extracts ( Fig 6c , lane 3 ) .
The cytoplasmic proteins of the immature marrow myeloid cells ( blasts and promyelocytes ) generated only a small amount of change on the nuclear protein complexes ( Fig 6¢ , lane 2 ) .
These in vitro experiments were performed in the presence of high concen- trations of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo-ride , aprotinin , and benzamide .
The change induced in the mobility of the nuclear protein complexes by the CML cell lysate was temperature ( oc-curred at 22°C , but not at 5°C ) and time ( barely detectable at 5 minutes , but complete by 1 hour ) dependent .
This activity was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of CML myeloid cells .
The levels of this activity in the peripheral blood myeloid cells of normal individuals were almost undetectable , although it was present in blasts and promyelocytes isolated from the marrow of normal individu-als .

which is a phosphatase inhibitor , '' to CML cells before isolation of cytoplasmic proteins or to the cytoplasmic proteins themselves , diminished the effect of the cytoplasmic proteins on the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein complexes ( data not shown ) .
Finally , IFN treatment of the cells of IFN-sensitive patients appeared to diminish the effect of the CML cytoplasmic protein on the electrophoretic mobility of these nuclear protein-DNA complexes ( Fig 6a , lane S ) .
Exposure of the cells of IFN-resistant CML patients to IFN-a , did not diminish the effect of the cytoplasmic protein on electrophoretic mobility of IFN-inducible complexes , as shown in lane 3 of Fig 6b .
This data suggested that there was an activity in the peripheral blood myeloid cells of CML patients , which is not present in normal peripheral blood myeloid cells , that altered the electrophoretic mobility of complexes between transcriptional enhancers and nuclear proteins .
We then tested in vitro the effect of purified enzymes that might account for this effect of CML cellular proteins on nuclear proteins .
When we added an acid phosphatase to the nuclear proteins from the Daudi cell line , the intensity of the low-mobility complex ( lane 1 ) decreased and complexes of more rapid mobility ( lanes 2 and 3 ) were generated , as shown in Fig 7 .
As shown by a comparison of lanes 2 , 3 , and 4 , the electrophoretic mobility of the acid phosphatase-treated nuclear proteins was higher than that formed by Daudi 1127 nuclear proteins before phosphatase exposure .
Thus , the effect of acid phosphatase is to generate complexes that have mobilities similar to those seen with nuclear proteins from normal lymphoid or Daudi cells following exposure to the cytoplasmic proteins of CML cells ( Fig 6 ) .
The electrophoretic mobility of the high-mobility complexes generated in lanes 2 and 3 by exposure to phosphatase is slightly less than that of the high-mobility complex present in the CML cell line EM-2 ( Fig 7 , lane 4 ) .
This may reflect the degree to which the potato phosphatase can dephosphorylate the nuclear proteins of the Daudi cells in vitro .
These data suggest that the cytoplasm of CML cells contains a phosphatase that alters the mobility of the complexes formed between nuclear proteins and IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers , and that IFN-a reverses these changes through a posttranslational effect in the IFN-sensitive Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML myeloid cell .
DISCUSSION Our studies show that the cytoplasmic proteins of CML peripheral blood myeloid cells induced a change in the electrophoretic mobility of complexes formed between the transcriptional enhancer sequences of the IFN-inducible genes 6-16 , 9-27 , beta-2 microglobulin , and 2,5-OAS and the nuclear proteins of hematopoietic cells .
The CML cytoplasmic proteins converted the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-DNA complexes from low to high mobility .
The cytoplasmic proteins of the mature myeloid peripheral blood cells of normal individuals had little or no effect on the mobility of these complexes .
Thus , the presence of proteins ( which alter nuclear protein-DNA complexes ) in the cytoplasm of CML cells may account for the differences seen in the electrophoretic mobility of the complexes formed between transcriptional enhancers and the nuclear proteins of normal versus CML myeloid cells .
Alpha-interferon appears to oppose this effect of CML cytoplasmic proteins on the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-DNA complexes in cells of CML patients clinically sensitive to IFN-a .
The sensitivity of cells to the IFN-induced changes of the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-DNA complexes was observed in 10 of 10 IFN-a « hematologic responders tested , in 11 of 12 partial cytogenetic responders tested , and in seven of seven of the complete cytogenetic responders tested .
The complexes formed by the interferon-inducible transcriptional enhancer and the nuclear proteins of only one of the 13 IFN-a-resistant CML patients tested exhibited changes in electrophoretic mobility following IFN .
This difference between the sensitivity to the IFN-a-induced effect on nuclear protein-DNA complexes in clinically sensitive ( 28 of 29 ) and resistant ( one of 13 ) patients was statistically significant ( P < .01 ) ( Table 2 ) .
A correlation between in vitro sensitivity to the antiproliferative effect of IFN and the sensitivity to the IFN- « -induced changes in the binding of nuclear proteins has also recently been reported in IFN-sensitive and -resistant B cell lines .

clinical effects of IFN in CML .
It is not yet clear that the transcriptional activation of gene transcription is important to the clinical antiproliferative effect of IFN-a in CML or whether the antiproliferative effect is mediated through a 1129 direct cytoplasmic pathway .
The IFN-induced change in electrophoretic mobility of the 2,5-0AS transcriptional enhancer nuclear protein complex may be an indicator of an event predictive of clinical sensitivity or resistance without being linked to transcriptional activation of IFN-inducible genes .
The in vitro effect of IFN-a on nuclear proteins from CML patients occurs within 1 hour after exposure of the cells to IFN and is not associated with changes in the percentages of lymphoid or myeloid cells in the peripheral blood of CML patients .
Studies by other investigators have shown that transcriptional activation by IFN-a starts to take place within 5 minutes and peaks within 1 hour of its binding to the plasma membrane IFN receptor .
: : Furthermore , the IFN-induced changes in the nuclear proteins of IFN-inducible genes started to occur within the first 4 minutes in the studies of others .
: This early effect of IFN-a , which is insensitive to cycloheximide inhibition in our studies and in those of others , : occurs at a time that is synchronous with the activation of gene expression .
: :s Our studies suggest that the IFN-a-induced changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the nuclear protein complexes is due to a posttranslational modification of nuclear proteins , since this is not inhibitable by cycloheximide .
The differences in mobility of the complexes between nuclear proteins and IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancers could be due to the posttranslational modification of a single protein or to binding of different nuclear proteins to the IFN-inducible transcriptional enhancer .
The nuclear protein binding assay described in this report may be useful in predicting the responsiveness of CML patients to IFN-a therapy .
We are conducting a prospective evaluation of this assay as a predictor of de novo sensitivity or resistance to IFN- « .
Further studies will focus on the characterization of the structure of these nuclear proteins and their posttranslational modifications , which occur in both normal individuals and CML patients after exposure to IFN .
