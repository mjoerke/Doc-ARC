10 A Novel Ets-Related Transcription Factor , Elf-1 , Binds to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 Regulatory Elements That Are Required for Inducible trans Activation in T Cells JEFFREY M.

THOMPSON®** The Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The Departments of Internal Medicine , '' and Biochemistry , '' University of Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109-0650 Received 9 April 1992/Accepted 24 June 1992 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) and HIV-2 are structurally related retroviruses which both cause AIDS in humans .
Although both viruses establish latency in quiescent human-peripheral-blood T cells , the asymptomatic phase of HIV-2 infection may be more prolonged than that of HIV-1 .
The latent phases of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection have been shown to be disrupted by T-cell activation , a process that requires host cell transcription factors .
In the case of HIV-1 , the transcription factor NF-xB is sufficient for inducible transcriptional activation .
In contrast , factors in addition to NF- « B are required to activate HIV-2 transcription in infected T cells .
In this report , we demonstrate that a novel Ets-related transcription factor , Elf-1 , binds specifically to two purine-rich motifs in the HIV-2 enhancer .
Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that these Elf-1 binding sites are required for induction of HIV-2 transcription following T-cell-receptor-mediated T-cell activation .
Moreover , Elf-1 is the only factor present in activated T-cell nuclear extracts that binds to these sites in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
Thus , Elf-1 is a novel transcription factor that appears to be required for the T-cell-receptor-mediated frans activation of HIV-2 gene expression .
These results may explain differences in the clinical spectra of diseases caused by HIV-1 and HIV-2 and may also have implications for the design of therapeutic approaches to HIV-2 infection .
Many RNA and DNA viruses that infect animal cells utilize host cell transcription factors to express genetic information ( 31 ) .
Thus , for example , transcription of the simian virus 40 genome is regulated by interactions between several host cell transcription factors , including Sp1 , AP-1 , and TEF-1 ( 32 ) .
Similarly , transcription of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I enhancer appears to be controlled , at least in part , by interactions between cellular transcription factors that belong to the Ets and CREB/ATF families ( 6 , 29 , 39 ) .
Previous studies have suggested that host cell transcription factors also play an important role in regulating the inducible expression of the human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIVs ) in T cells ( 1-3 , 17 , 25 , 30 , 31 , 36 , 42 ) .
Two different types of HIVs , HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) and HIV-2 , have thus far been described ( 4 , 8-10 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 25 , 31 ) .
The life cycles of both viruses are characterized by an initial viremia and infection of circulating CD4 * T cells followed by a latent relatively asymptomatic phase which can last for as long as 10 years and which is characterized by a lack of transcription of the integrated proviral genome ( 11 , 17 , 25 , 31 ) .
HIV latency is disrupted by the transcriptional activation of the viral genome during the process of T-cell-receptor ( TCR ) -mediated T-cell activation .
The transcriptional activation of the proviral genome requires the participation of inducible .
host cell transcription factors that bind to the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and activate viral gene expression ( 1-3 , 17 , 25 , 30 , 31 , 36 , 42 ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated significant differences in the patterns of T-cell latency during HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections ( 4 , 25 ) .

5890 has been suggested that there may be fundamental differences in the host transcription factors involved in the trans activation of these two related human retroviruses ( 30 ) .
Binding of the inducible transcription factor NF-kB to two sites in the HIV-1 enhancer appears to be sufficient to activate HIV-1 gene expression in T cells ( 36 ) .
In contrast , it has been shown that factors in addition to NF- « B are needed to activate transcription of the HIV-2 LTR ( 30 ) .
In the studies described in this report , we have identified two purine-rich sequences ( purine boxes 1 and 2 [ PuB1 and PuB2 ] ) in the HIV-2 LTR that are required for transcriptional induction following TCR-mediated T-cell activation .
We have also shown that these sequences bind a novel member of the Ets family of transcription factors , called Elf-1 .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) utilizing an antiserum were used to demonstrate that Elf-1 is the only factor in activated T-cell nuclear extracts that binds to these purine-rich sequence motifs in EMSAs .
Taken together , these results show that the transcriptional activation of the HIV-2 LTR , unlike that of the HIV-1 LTR , requires at least two host cell transcription factors , NF- « B and Elf-1 .
These findings may be relevant to understanding some of the differences in the biological behavior of these two related retroviral pathogens .

In vitro translation reactions were performed with a commercially available rabbit reticulocyte system ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( 40 ) .
Production of recombinant Eif-1 protein and Elf-1-specific rabbit antiserum .
For production of recombinant Elf-1 protein for immunization , the Elf-1 cDNA was excised from pcDNAl/neo by digestion with EcoRV and cloned into the BamHI site of the pET-3b vector ( 38 ) ( following blunting with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I ) .
The resulting plasmid was transformed into competent BL21 ( DE3 ) bacteria , and a single colony was grown in M9ZB medium containing 100 ug of carbenicillin per ml to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 .
Isopropyl-B-p-thiogalac-topyranoside ( IPTG ) was added to a final concentration of 2 mM , and cells were grown at 37°C for 2.5 h with shaking .
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge ( Eppendorf ) and lysed in 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) -1 mM EDTA-1 mM DTT-1 mM PMSF-260 mg of lysozyme per ml .
Inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge .
Proteins were denatured and solubilized in 6 M urea and then renatured by dialysis against buffer D overnight at 4°C prior to being frozen in aliquots at -70°C .
Control extracts were prepared from BL21 ( DE3 ) bacteria containing the pET-3b plasmid without a cDNA insert .
Rabbits were immunized with three sequential subcutaneous injections of 100 to 150 pug of renatured recombinant Elf-1 protein in complete ( first immu-nization ) or incomplete ( second and third immunizations ) Freund 's adjuvant .
Serum was collected 9 days after the third immunization .
This serum was shown to specifically immunoprecipitate in vitro-translated Elf-1 but not Ets-1 or Ets-2 protein ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , in control experiments , this serum did not interfere with the binding of Ets-1 or members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors in EMSAs ( data not shown ) .
Nucleotide sequence accession number .
The complete nucleotide sequence of Elf-1 is available through GenBank , accession number MS82882 .
RESULTS Two purine-rich sequence motifs are required for transcriptional activation of the HIV-2 LTR .
A comparison of the sequences of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers ( Fig .
1A ) demonstrated the absence of one of the two NF- « B sites in HIV-2 compared with HIV-1 .
In addition , the HIV-2 enhancer contains two purine-rich sequence motifs , PuB1l and PuB2 , corresponding to the recently described consensus binding site for the Ets family of transcription factors ( 18 , 20 , 26 , 27 , 41 , 44 ) .
These two motifs are conserved in at least J. Viror .
eight strains of HIV-2 but are absent from the HIV-1 enhancer .
Similar motifs are also present in the transcriptional enhancers of several other inducible T-cell genes including those of the human interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-3 , and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) genes ( Fig .
1B ) .
To test the importance of the purine boxes and the NF-kB site for inducibility of the HIV-2 enhancer , we prepared CAT reporter constructs containing either the wild-type HIV-2 LTR or mutant LTRs with nucleotide substitutions in the PuB1 and PuB2 ( APuB ) or the NF- « B ( A « B ) binding sites .
These reporter constructs were transfected into human Jurkat T cells .
Portions of the transfected cultures were treated with medium alone , while other portions were activated by treatment with PMA or by cross-linking of the TCR complex by treatment with the anti-CD3 antibody G19-4 .
In agreement with previous results ( 30 ) , the wild-type HIV-2 enhancer was induced 50- to 100-fold following T-cell activation with either PMA or the anti-CD3 MAb ( Fig .
2 ) .
Mutation of the NF-KB site reduced PMA inducibility by more than 90 % ( Fig .
2 ) and had a similar effect on inducibility following TCR cross-linking ( 30 and data not shown ) .
Mutation of both purine boxes abolished the inducibility of the HIV-2 enhancer ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast , mutation of either purine box alone decreased but did not abolish inducible enhancer activity following either PMA treatment or TCR cross-linking ( 30a ) .
Thus , both the NF-KB binding site and at least one purine box are required for the inducibility of the HIV-2 enhancer following signaling through the TCR complex or activation with phorbol esters .
A novel Ets family member , Elf-1 , binds to the purine boxes of the HIV-2 LTR .
Two Ets family members , Ets-1 and Ets-2 , were known to be expressed in T cells ( 5 ) .
Several types of experiments were performed to determine whether either of these proteins bound to the purine boxes in the HIV-2 enhancer .
First , recombinant and in vitro-transcribed and -translated Ets-1 and Ets-2 proteins were used in EMSAs with radiolabeled probes containing PuBl and PuB2 .
Neither Ets-1 nor Ets-2 bound efficiently to the purine boxes from the HIV-2 enhancer despite the fact that these same protein preparations bound with high affinity to the Ta2 ( 20 ) site from the TCR a enhancer ( see Fig .
4 ; data not shown ) .
In a second series of experiments , anti-Ets-1 and anti-Ets-2 MAbs were used in EMSA experiments utilizing radiolabeled PuBl and PuB2 probes and nuclear extracts from PMA-activated normal human peripheral blood T cells .
Neither of these antibodies caused alterations in the binding and/or mobility of the major T-cell nuclear protein complex that bound to PuB1l and PuB2 ( see Fig .
4 ) .
Taken together , these experiments demonstrated that neither Ets-1 nor Ets-2 is involved in regulating the inducibility of the HIV-2 enhancer and suggested the possibility that there are novel Ets-related nuclear proteins that interact with PuB1 and PuB2 in T cells .
To test this hypothesis , we screened an activated Jurkat T-cell cDNA library by low-stringency hybridization with a probe from the DNA-binding domain of Ets-1 .
One cDNA clone isolated by this approach was shown to contain an Ets basic domain with 39 of 42 amino acids identical to those of the ecdysone-inducible transcription factor E74 , which is required for Drosophila metamorphosis ( 7 ) .
We therefore named this clone E74-like factor-1 ( Elf-1 ) ( 40 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the full-length 3.6-kb Elf-1 cDNA contains a 315-bp 5 ' untranslated region , a single long open reading frame of 1,857 bp , and a 1,392-bp 3 ' untranslated region .
The predicted amino acid sequence of Elf-1 includes a basic domain that is related to those of the other Ets family members as well as an a-helical domain Vor .

Functional significance of the xB and PuB sites in the HIV-2 enhancer .
Jurkat human T cells were transfected with reporter plasmids by using a modification of the DEAE-dextran protocol .
Thirty hours after transfection , cultures were treated with medium alone ( - ) or PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )
or were cultured in plastic tissue culture dishes coated with 1 ug of the G19-4 anti-CD3 MAb per ml as described in Materials and Methods .
Cells were harvested 12 h after stimulation , and cell extracts normalized for protein content by using a commercially available kit ( Bio-Rad ) were assayed for CAT and B-galactosidase activities .
The data are shown as CAT activity relative to that of the medium-treated control following normalization for differences in transfection efficiencies .
Autoradiograms of representative CAT assays are shown at the right .
immediately 5 ' of the basic region that is also conserved in most of the other Ets proteins ( 26 ) .
Together , these two regions , previously termed the ETS domain , represent the DNA-binding domain of the Ets family of transcription factors ( 26 , 45 ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated that E74 binds to a purine-rich sequence ( ACGAATCAGGAAAACTG ) that contains a core pentanucleotide that is identical to PuB1 and PuB2 ( 44 ) .
We therefore reasoned that Elf-1 might bind preferentially to the purine boxes from the HIV-2 enhancer .
As shown in Fig .
4 , in vitro-transcribed and -translated Elf-1 protein bound to PuB1 and PuB2 but not to the Ta2 Ets-1 binding site from the human TCR a enhancer .
Conversely , Ets-1 bound to Ta2 but failed to bind to PuBl or PuB2 .
Binding of Elf-1 to PuB2 was efficiently inhibited by unlabeled PuB2 and PuB1 oligonucleotide competitors but not by competitors containing nucleotide substitutions within the core of PuBl or PuB2 ( see Fig .
1A for the nucleotide substitutions ) ( Fig .
4C ) .
Finally , an antiserum raised against recombinant Elf-1 protein specifically inhibited binding of in vitro-transcribed and -translated Elf-1 to PuB2 and also inhibited binding of the major nuclear protein complex from PMA-activated normal human peripheral blood T cells to this same probe ( Fig .
4B ) .
Of note , the mobility of the PuB2 binding complex from activated T-cell nuclear extracts was identical to that produced by in vitro-translated Elf-1 protein ( Fig .
4B ) .
In control experiments , preimmune rabbit serum as well as anti-Ets-1 , anti-Ets-2 , and anti-IL-2-receptor antibodies had no effect on Elf-1 binding ( Fig .
4 ) .
Taken together , these experiments demonstrated that Elf-1 present in activated T-cell nuclear extracts binds preferentially and specifically to the purine boxes from the HIV-2 enhancer .
Furthermore , these Elf-1 binding sites are required for trans activation of the enhancer following T-cell activation .
DISCUSSION In the studies described in this report , we have identified two purine-rich sequence motifs corresponding to Ets-bind-ing sites that are required for the inducible expression of the HIV-2 LTR .
These sites bind a novel Ets-related family member , Elf-1 , but fail to bind the closely related Ets-1 transcription factor .
Importantly , Elf-1 appears to be the only protein in activated T-cell nuclear extracts that binds to these sites in EMSAs .
In agreement with previous reports ( 30 ) , we have shown that in addition to the Elf-1-binding sites , HIV-2 activation also requires an intact NF- « B binding site .
These results have several implications for the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-2 activation in T cells and for understanding the role of Ets family members in regulating inducible gene expression during T-cell activation .
The preponderance of evidence from several experimental systems suggests that Ets family members activate transcription by working in concert with other non-Ets DNA-binding proteins .
Thus , for example , Ets-1 has been shown to cooperate with AP-1 to activate transcription of the poly-omavirus enhancer ( 46 ) .
Similarly , GABPa , a novel Ets family member , has recently been shown to cooperate with GABPB and VP16 to activate HSV-1 immediate-early genes ( 41 ) .
The results presented in this report suggest that Elf-1 can also function cooperatively with the NF- « B family of transcription factors to activate transcription of the HIV-2 LTR during T-cell activation .
The requirement for both proteins may explain in part why overexpression of Elf-1 alone fails to activate the HIV-2 LTR ( data not shown ) .
In addition , it is worth noting that recent studies have demonstrated that Elf-1 interacts with the product of the retinoblas-toma gene ( 45a ) .
Thus , the regulation of Elf-1-dependent transcriptional activation is complex and can not be dupli- 5894 LEIDEN ET AL .

cated by simple overexpression in T cells .
The molecular mechanisms underlying cooperative interactions between Ets family members and other transcription factors have not yet been fully defined .
However , structural comparisons of the different Ets family members and their cooperative partners suggest that multiple distinct interactive domains may be responsible for this cooperativity ( 15 , 28 , 37 ) .
The results presented in this report also suggest that different Ets family members display distinct DNA-binding specificities and may thereby regulate the expression of Vor .

Binding of Elf-1 to purine boxes in the HIV-2 enhancer .
( A ) Binding of in vitro-transcribed and -translated Elf-1 and Ets-1 proteins to radiolabeled PuB1 and Ta ?
( 22 ) probes was as described previously ( 40 , 45 ) .
The positions of the Elf-1 and Ets-1 bands are shown by arrows .
( B ) Antibody blocking of Elf-1 binding .
Binding reaction mixtures containing in vitro-transcribed and translated Elf-1 ( left panel ) or nuclear extracts from PMA-ionomycin-activated normal human peripheral blood T cells ( right panel ) were pretreated with 1 pl of preimmune or « -Elf-1 rabbit antiserum or 1 pl of the previously described a-Ets-1 ( 22 ) , « -Ets-2 ( 14 ) , or a commercially available ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , Calif. ) « -IL-2 receptor ( « -IL-2R ) MAb at 4°C for 15 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled PuB2 probe .
The position of the Elf-1 band is indicated with an arrow .
The faint band remaining in the nuclear extract lane following pretreatment with the o-Elf-1 antiserum and competitions with PuBl and PuB2 oligonucleotides represents a nonspecific DNA-binding activity with slightly faster mobility than that of the wild-type Elf-1 protein .
( C ) Cold competitor experiments .
Radiolabeled PuB2 probe was incubated with nuclear extract from PMA-ionomycin-activated normal human peripheral blood T cells in the absence ( - ) or presence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides .
The nucleotide substitutions used to make the mutant PuB1 ( APuB1 ) and PuB2 ( APuB2 ) oligonucleotides are shown in Fig .
1A .
The Elf-1 band is indicated by the arrow .
The two lower bands represent non-sequence-specific DNA-binding activities in that they are inhibited equally by wild-type and mutant PuBl and PuB2 cold competitor oligonucleotides as well as by several unrelated oligonucleotide competitors .
different sets of genes in T cells .
Thus , for example , Ets-1 binds to the TCR a enhancer but fails to bind to the HIV-2 enhancer .
Conversely , Elf-1 binds to the HIV-2 but not to the TCR a enhancer .
Furthermore , despite the fact that multiple Ets family members are expressed in T cells ( 40 ) , EIf-1 is the only protein in activated T-cell nuclear extracts that can be shown by EMSA to bind to the purine boxes in the HIV-2 enhancer .
Thus , transcription factors containing Ets domains appear to display pleiomorphic regulatory activities by virtue of their abilities to cooperate with multiple other DNA-binding proteins and to bind with different specificities to purine-rich enhancer motifs .
In a separate report , we have recently demonstrated that nucleotides at the 3 ' ends of the Ets binding sites determine the fine specificities of binding of Ets-l1 and Elf-1 to naturally occurring Ets binding sites in the TCR « , IL-2 , and HIV-2 enhancers ( 45 ) .
Finally , we can not rule out the possibility that additional Ets or non-Ets transcription factors bind to the HIV-2 enhancer in vivo but fail to bind in in vitro EMSAs .
Although the organization of HIV-2 is quite similar to that of HIV-1 , the nucleotide sequences of the two viruses differ significantly ( 19 ) .
This sequence divergence involves both the structural genes of the viruses and their transcriptional enhancers .
These differences in primary structure are reflected in the distinct immunodeficiency syndromes caused by HIV-1 and HIV-2 .
In particular , the asymptomatic latent period of HIV-2 infection appears to be significantly longer than that associated with HIV-1 infection ( 4 , 25 ) .
The studies described in this report suggest a molecular mechanism that may account for these differences .
Unlike HIV-1 trans activation , which appears to require only NF- « B for induction from latency ( 30 , 36 ) , HIV-2 trans activation requires both NF- « B and Elf-1 , a novel Ets-related family member present in activated T cells .
Thus , these results suggest that , as is the case for avian and murine retroviruses , human retroviruses have evolved to utilize different sets of host factors for transcriptional regulation .
These results also suggest Elf-1 as a potential target for therapeutic approaches designed to block the activation of HIV-2 from latency .
