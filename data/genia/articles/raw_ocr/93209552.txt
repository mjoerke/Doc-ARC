Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press p105 and p98 precursor proteins cFlay an active role in NF-signal transduction Frank Mercurio , *~ > Joseph A. DiDonato , '' '' Caridad Rosette , '' and Michael Karin'* Departments of 'Pharmacology and Biology , Center for Molecular Genetics , University of California , San Diego , School of Medicine , La Jolla , California 92093-0636 USA The Rel/NF-KB family of transcription factors is composed of two distinct subgroups , proteins that undergo proteolytic processing and contain SW1IG6/ankyrin repeats in their carboxyl termini ( p105 , p98 ) , and those without such repeats that do not require processing ( p65 , c-Rel , RelB , and Dorsal ) , We demonstrate that the p105 and p98 precursors share functional properties with the IxB proteins , which also contain SWI6/ankyrin repeats .
Both p105 and p98 were found to form stable complexes with other Rel/NF-B family members , including p65 and c-Rel .
Association with the precursors is sufficient for cytoplasmic retention of either p65 or c-Rel , both of which are otherwise nuclear .
These complexes undergo stimulus-responsive processing to produce active p50/c-Rel and p55/c-Rel complexes .
These observations suggest a second pathway leading to NF-B induction , in which processing of the precursors rather than phosphorylation of IxB plays a major role .

Interaction of ligands with cell-surface receptors modulates transcription factor activity , thereby affecting gene expression ( Karin 1992 ) .
Several mechanisms are used to transmit signals generated at the cell surface across the plasma and nuclear membranes before reaching the nucleus .
Most of these mechanisms are based on post-translational activation or repression of pre-existing transcription factors and frequently involve changes in protein phosphorylation ( Hunter and Karin 1992 ; Karin 1992 ) .
However , other mechanisms are also possible .
One group of transcription factors , the Rel/NF- « B proteins , are involved in the rapid induction of genes , whose products function in protective and proliferative re-sponses , upon exposure to a variety of extemal stimuli ( Lenardo and Baltimore 1989 ; Baecuerle 1991 ; Baeuerle and Baltimore 1991 ) .
Members of this family also control cell differentiation ( Steward 1987 ) .
Rel/NFxB proteins form dimeric complexes that are well suited for mounting rapid responses to extracellular stimuli because their activation does not require de novo protein synthesis and is dependent , in part , on translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus .
The inactive cytoplasmic form of NF- « B can be activated to undergo nuclear translocation within minutes of an appropriate stimulus ( Baeuerle and Baltimore 1991 ] .
The major form of NF- « B is a heterodimer composed of 50-kD ( p50 ) and 65-kD ( p65 ) DNA-binding subunits ( Bae- *These authors made equal contributions to this work .

uerle and Baltimore 1989 ; Urban et al .
1991 } .
The inactive cytosolic form of NF- « B is associated with inhibi-tors , termed IxBs , which bind primarily through p65 ( Baeuerle and Baltimore 1989 ; Urban and Baeverle 1990 ; Beg et al .
1992 ) .
The IxBs are thought to be released in response to cell stimulation , and the NF- « B heterodimer is freed to translocate to the nucleus ( Baeuerle and Baltimore 1988a , b ) .
Release of IxB is presumed to involve phosphorylation by a yet-to-be identified protein kinase , which in vitro can be substituted by protein kinase C ( Shirakawa and Mizel 1989 ; Ghosh and Baltimore 1990 ) .
This relatively simple picture has become progressively complex upon the discovery that p50 ( Bours et al .
1990 ; Ghosh et al .
1990 ; Kieran et al .
1990 ; Meyer et al .
1991 ) and p65 [ Nolan et al .
1991 ; Ruben et al .
1991 ) belong to a large family of related transcription factors , including v-Rel ( Stephens et al .
1983 ; Wilhelmsen et al .
1984 ) , c-Rel ( Brownell et al .
1989 ) , RelB ( Ryseck et al .
1992 ) , p98 /p55 ( also termed p100/p49 , p50B , or LYT1O ) ( Neri et al .
1991 ; Schmid et al .
1991 ; Bours et al .
1992 ; Mercurio et al .
1992 ) , and the Drosophila dorsal gene product ( Steward 1987 ) .
These proteins bind to similar DNA se-quences , are subject to regulated subcellular localization , and contain a common structural motif , the Rel homology domain .
This 300-amino-acid domain contains subregions that mediate DNA binding , dimerization and nuclear localization ( Ghosh et al .
1990 ; Kieran et al .
1990 ; Logeat et al .
1991 ) .
The mammalian Rel/NFxB proteins form homo- and heterodimers that bind with different affinities to variants of the kB motif ( Ballard et GENES & DEVELOPMENT 7:705-718 © 1993 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/93 $ 5.00 705 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Mercuric et al .

1990 ; Radler-Pohl et al , 1990 ; Perkins et al .
1992 ) , This complexity provides the cell with opportunities to fine-tune NF-KB activity and respond to a variety of activating signals .
A unique feature of p50 is that it is synthesized as a 105-kD precursor ( pl05 ) with the Rel homology domain in its amino-terminal portion .
A precursor/product relationship between p105 and p50 was established ( Fan and Maniatis 1991 } .
The related protein p55 is also produced as a larger 98-kD precursor , p98 ( Mercurio et al .
1992 ] .
p105 and p98 are unable to bind DNA ( Bours et al .
1990 ; Ghosh et al .
1990 ; Kieran et al .
1990 ] , and p105 was shown to be exclusively cytoplasmic ( Blank et al .
1991 ; Henkel et al .
1992 ) .
Unlike other family members , p105 and p98 also exhibit limited sequence homology in their carboxy-terminal regions , which contain seven SWIG/ ankyrin repeats ( Bours et al .
1990,1992 ; Kieran et al .
1990 ; Meyer et al , 1991 ; Neri et al .
1991 ; Schmid et al .
1991 ; Mercurio et al .
1992 ) .
Interestingly , the IxB proteins also contain SWIG/ankyrin repeats ( Ohno et al .
1990 ; Davis et al .
1991 ; Haskill et al .
1991 ; Hatada et al .
1992 ; Inoue et al .
1992 ) .
The carboxy-terminal domain of p105 is required for its cytoplasmic retention ( Blank et al .
1992 ) , and similar observations were made for p98 ( F. Mercurio and C. Rosette , unpubl . ) .
Henec , proteolytic processing of p105 and p98 , leading to the loss of their carboxy-terminal portion , results in activation of their amino-terminal halves , p50 and p55 , respectively .
This allows for nuclear translocation and DNA binding by p50 and p55 , provided they are not associated with an IkB .
An often overlooked aspect of Rel/NE- « B regulation is the potential role of the most abundant Rel/NF-KB family members , p105 and p98 .
Are they simply precursors , do they serve as reservoirs of p50 and p55 , or do they have an unrecognized regulatory role ?
This study examined the functions of the two precursors , and its results lead us to propose that p105 and p98 can play a dynamic role in regulation of NF-kB activity .
Both p105 and p98 are capable of forming stable complexes with other family members , including each other .
p105/c-Rel and p98 / c-Rel complexes were found to be processed into active p50/c-Rel and pS5/c-Rel complexes .
We demonstrate that cell stimulation results in an increased level of processing .
Collectively , these observations suggest a mechanism according to which cytoplasmic to nuclear signaling by Rel/NF- « B complexes can occur independently of IB .
Results p105 and p98 form stable complexes with other family members in vitro p105 and its homolog p98 are processed to yield mature kB DNA-binding proteins , p50 and p55 , respectively ( Fan and Maniatis 1991 ; Mercurio et al .
1992 ) .
Both p50 and p55 form stable complexes with other Rel/NF- « B proteins { Gilmore 1991 ; Rushlow and Warrior 1992 ) .
We examined whether p105 and p98 could form analogous 706 GENES & DEVELOPMENT complexes .
This appeared reasonable in light of similar electrophoretic mobilities of p105 and p98 to previously characterized 124-kD and 115-kD v-Rel- and c-Rel-associated proteins [ Simek and Rice 19882 , b ; Morrison et al .
1989 ; Davis et al .
1990 ; Lim et al .
1990 ) .
Capobianco et al .
( 1992 ) demonstrated that p105 associates with v-Rel in vitro , Rel/NF-kB proteins labeled with were produced by cell-free translation using in vitro-transcribed RNA .
After either separate or combined translations , the proteins were irnmunoprecipitated with antibodies made against unique regions of the Rel/ NF-KB protcins , including anti-p105N , raised against the amino terminus of p105 ; anti-p1l05C , raised against the carboxyl terminus of p105 , ; anti-pI8N , raised against the amino terminus of p98 ; anti-c-Rel , raised against the carboxyl terminus of c-Rel ( kindly provided by Dr. N. Rice ] , and anti-p65C , raised against the carboxyl terminus of p65 { kindly provided by Dr. W. Greene , Gladstone Institute of Virology , San Francisco , CA ) { Fig .
1 ) .
In addition , a peptide epitope ( Flag ) was fused to the amino termini of some protcins to facilitate the analysis of heterocomplex formation , using monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies { ( Mer-curio et al .
1992 ) .
Antibodies used in these studies do not cross-react with other related Rel/NF- « B proteins .
These experiments , the results of which are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 1 , demonstrate that both p105 and p98 form stable complexes with p65 and c-Rel .
In addition , both p105 and p98 form stable complexes with p50 , p55 , and with each other ( data not shown ) .
All of these complexes were sufficiently stable to withstand relatively stringent immunoprecipitation conditions using RIPA buffer .
Higher order complex formation among Rel/NF- « B proteins in vivo The ability of p105 and p98 to associate with one another and other Rel/NF- « xB proteins in vitro does not necessarily mean that these proteins associate in vivo .

4 , Immune complexes isolated from RIPA lysates were eluted as intact hetero-oligomers by the addition of a large excess of the specific peptide immunogen , and the resulting supernatant was subjected to secondary immunoprecipitation as described above .
Primary immunoprecipitations of RIPA lysates of *°S-labeled HeLa S3 cells with anti-plO5N , using method 1 , identified specifically precipitated polypeptides of 37-40 , 50 , 65 , 80 , 114 , and 120 kD ( { the 114- and 120-kD polypeptides are not resolved in this cxposure ; Fig.3 A , lanes 1,2 ) .
Immunoprecipitations of the same lysates with anti-p9I8N identified specifically precipitated polypeptides of 50 , 55 , 62 , 65 , 114 , and 120 kD ( Fig .
3A , lanes 3,4 ) .
Immunoprecipitations of denatured Hela cell lysates with anti-p98N identified a major 114-kD polypeptide and a minor 55-kD polypeptide , migrating as a doublet ( Fig .
3B , lanes 5,6 ) .
These polypeptides are likely to correspond to the p98 precursor and its processed form , p55 , respectively .
A 62-kD polypeptide can also be detected after a longer exposure ( data not shown ) .
This polypeptide , which is clearly seen in Figures 3 , A and C , and 9 , B and C ( below ] , most likely represents a protein that shares an antigenic epitope with the amino terminus of p98/pS55 but is not a member of the Rel/NF- « kB family , because it does not associate with other family members ( see Figs .
4 and 5 ) .
The 50 , 65 , and 120-kD polypeptides that are precipitated by anti-p9I8N from native but not denatured lysates represent polypeptides associated with either p55 or p98 , or both .
Similar immunoprecipitations of denatured lysates with anti-p105N identified 50- and 120-kD polypeptides that are likely to correspond to the p105 precursor and its p50 product ( data not shown ) .
Therefore the 55- , 65- , and 114-kD polypeptides that are precipitated by anti-p10O5N , only from native lysates , are polypeptides that associate with either p50 or p105 , or both .
Interestingly , for both p105 and p98 , the precursors give rise to signals that are considerably stronger than the signals corresponding to their products .
To identify the precise nature of the polypeptides associated with p98 and p105 , we performed sequential immunoprecipitations .

Jurkat cells were stimulated with TPA ( 100 ng/ml ) and ConA ( 2 ug/ml } , and metabolically labeled with [ °°S ] -methio-nine for 5 hr .
Cell lysates were prepared in either SDS-RIPA buffer and boiled [ method 2 ( ii ) ; lanes 1,2 ] or RIPA buffer { method 1 ( i ) ; lanes 3,4 } , and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Rel .
To demonstrate complex formation between either p105 or p98 and c-Rel , primary anti-c-Rel immune complexes were disrupted by boiling in SDS-RIPA buffer and subjected to secondary immunoprecipitation [ method 3 ( iii ) ] with either anti-p98N { lanes 5,6 ) or anti-plO5N { lanes 7,8 ) .
Lanes 9-12 represent a longer exposure of lanes 5-8 , respectively .
The various antisera were preincubated with either specific [ SP ) or nonspecific ( NS ) peptide competitors , as indicated .
and reprecipitated with anti-pl0O5N ( Fig .
3B , lanes 1,2 ) .
The results clearly demonstrate that the 50-kD and 120-kD polypeptides associated with p98/p55 are actually p50 and p105 .
Thus , these results indicate that p105 associates with p55 and/or p98 in vivo .
Similar results were obtained by sequential immunoprecipitation using method 4 .
Anti-p98N complexes were disrupted by incubation with a large excess of specific peptide compet-itor .
The supernatant , which should contain intact het-ero-oligomers , was then subjected to secondary immunoprecipitation with anti-p105N .
The results show that p50 , p55 , p98 , and p105 were all coprecipitated ( Fig .
3B , lanes 3,4 ) .
Surprisingly , a 65-kD polypeptide also coprecipitated by anti-p105N .
The same results were obtained using anti-p105C , and the identity of the 65-kD polypeptide was established as p65 , using anti-p65C { data not shown ) .
These results suggest that a portion of p105 , p98 , and p65 are engaged in a higher order complex , different from a simple heterodimer .
It was reported that p105 is exclusively cytoplasmic ( Fan and Maniatis 1991 ; Henkel et al .
1992 ) .
To determine the subcellular localization of p98 and p55 , cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of TPA-stimulated HeLa cells were analyzed by Western blotting .
Although p98 was exclusively cytoplasmic , the p55 doublet was mostly nuclear ( Fig .
3C ) .
The cytoplasmic 50-kD polypeptide was not observed in all experiments and is most likely derived from nonspecific proteolysis of p98 , be Role of p105 and p98 in NF-KB signaling cause it was not detected in immunoprecipitates of denatured cell lysates in which only minimal proteolysis occurs .
Similar results were obtained with cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts prepared from TPA-stimulated Jurkat cells { data not shown ) .
The 62-kD polypeptide is the cross-reactive protein described above .
Association of p105 and p98 with c-Rel and p65 in vivo Proteins associated with v-Rel and c-Rel have been characterized extensively in reticuloendotheliosis virus T-transformed spleen cells and chicken embryo fibro-blasts [ Simek and Rice 1988 a , b ; Tung et al .
1988 ; Morrison et al .
1989 ; Davis et al .
1990 ; Lim et al .
1990 ) .
These Rel-associated proteins have approximate molecular masses of 40 , 70 , 115 , and 124 kD .
The 40- and 70-kD polypeptides represent avian IkBa ( pp40 ) and Hsp70 , respectively ( Lim et al .
1990 ; Davis et al .
1991 ) , whereas the 124-kD polypeptide corresponds to p105 { Capobianco et al .
1992 ) .
It is therefore reasonable to assume that the 115-kD protein corresponds to p98 .
To examine interactions of c-Rel with other Rel/NF- « B proteins in mammalian cells , lysates of TPA/concanavalin ( ConA ) -stimulated Jurkat cells , metabolically labeled with [ °°S ) methionine , were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Rel antibodies .
Immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions { method 2 ) identified c-Rel as an 80- to 85-kD doublet [ Fig .
4 , lanes 1,2 ) .
Immunoprecipitation of RIPA lysates with anti-c-Rel ( method 1 ) revealed several c-Rel-associated polypeptides , of which a poorly resolved doublet ( seen in a shorter exposure ) of 114 and 120 kD was most intense [ Fig .

The final immune complexes were analyzed as indicated above .

immunoprecipitation ( method 3 ) .
Secondary immunoprecipitation of disrupted anti-c-Rel immune complexes with anti-p98N revealed that the 114-kD polypeptide corresponds to p98 ( Fig .
4 lanes 5,6 ) .
A longer exposure ( Fig .
4 , lanes 9,10 ) revealed a small amount of p55 .
Interestingly , a small amount of the c-Rel doublet is reprecipitated by anti-p98N even from denatured supernatants { lane 5 ) , and a small amount of p98 is coprecipitated with c-Rel from the denatured lysate ( lane 1 ) .
These results suggest either incomplete dissociation of the initial complex or , more likely , rapid reassociation of the dissociated subunits upon dilution of the denatured lysate .
Secondary immunoprecipitation with anti-p10O5N revealed that the c-Rel-associated 120-kD polypeptide corresponds to p1Q05 ( Fig .
4 , lanes 7,8 ) .
A longer exposure ( Fig .
4 , lanes 11,12 ) revealed a very small amount of p50 .
We were unable , however , to detect either p50 or p55 in c-Rel complexes isolated from lysates of unstimulated Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
These experiments demonstrate that c-Rel associates with both p105 and p98 in vivo .
To determine whether p65 associates with p105 and p98 in vivo , immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-p65C ( kindly provided by Dr. W. Greene ) , directed against the carboxyl terminus of p65 .
Immunoprecipitation with anti-p65C of RIPA lysates of metabolically labeled Jurkat cells identified p65 accompanied by several other polypeptides , with masses of 50 , 55 , and 115-120 kD ( data not shown ) .
These primary anti-p65C immune complexes were disrupted by boiling in SDS-RIPA buffer and reprecipitated with anti-p98N or anti-p1l05N .
These experiments identified the 115-kD polypeptide as p98 and the 55-kD polypeptide as p55 ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1,2 ) ; whereas the 120- and 50-kD polypeptides correspond to p105 and p50 , respectively ( Fig .
5 , lanes 3,4 ) .
Thus , like c-Rel , p65 also associates with p105 and p98 in vivo .
As observed above for c-Rel ( Fig .
4 ) , a small amount of p65 reassociated with both p105 and p98 .
This reassociation most likely occurred upon dilution of the renatured lysate before immunoprecipitation .
A summary of the in vitro and in vivo interactions identified between Rel/NF- « B proteins is shown in Table 1 .
MAD-3 is not associated with p105 complexes in vivo Cytoplasmic localization of NF- « B is mediated by association with inhibitor proteins of approximate molecular mass 37-40 kD-IKBa and IxBB ( Baeuerle and Baltimore 1988a , b ; Ghosh and Baltimore 1990 ; Zabel and Baeuerle 1990 ) .
Recently Haskill et al .
( 1991 ) have cloned an immediate-early gene from human monocytes , termed MAD-3 , encoding a 37-kD protein thought to correspond to IxBa .
To determine whether MAD-3 associates with precursor-containing complexes in vivo , sequential immunoprecipitations ( method 3 ) of disrupted anti-p10O5N and anti-pl05C immune complexes were performed with either anti-p65C or anti-MAD-3 antisera ( Fig .
6 ) .
Although p65 was found in both the anti-pl05N and anti-p105C immune complexes , MAD-3 was present only in the p105N immune complex .

- MAD-3 is not associated with p105-containing complexes .
TPA/ConA-stimulated Jurkat cells were metabolically labeled with [ °°S ] methionine for 5hr and lysed in TNT buffer , which retains associations , and immunoprecipitated with either anti-p105N ( lanes 1,2 ) or anti-p105C ( lanes 3,4 ) antisera .
To determine whether MAD-3 or p65 is present within the primary immune complexes , these complexes were disrupted in SDS-RIPA buffer and reprecipitated { method 3 ( iii ) ] with cither anti- ( lanes 5,6,9,10 } or anti-p65C ( lanes 7,8,11,12 ) antisera .
All antisera were preincubated with either specific ( SP ) or nonspecific ( NS ) peptide competitor , as indicated .
p105C reacts only with the precursor and not the mature p50 product , it appears that MAD-3 is not associated with p105 in vivo .
Although it is formally possible that anti-p105C is incapable of reacting with MAD-3-con-taining complexes , it is important to note that MAD-3 is only a minor component of the complexes isolated by anti-pl0O5N { seen only after a longer exposure of Fig .
6 ) .
Therefore , even if MAD-3 associates with some p105-containing complexes , it is not present in the majority of these complexes .
Association with either p105 or p98 leads to cytoplasmic retention of p65 and c-Rel NF- « B-mediated transcriptional activation is regulated in part by subcellular localization ( Baeuerle 1991 ) .
Because both p105 and p98 can associate with either c-Rel or p65 in vitro and in vivo , and both of these proteins contain SWIG6/ankyrin repeats similar to IB , we explored the possibility that this association could result in cytoplasmic retention of c-Rel and p65 .
To this end , a sequence encoding a peptide epitope ( Flag ) was fused to the initiation codons of the cDNAs encoding c-Rel and p65 to enable their detection by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal anti-Flag antibody .
The FL-c-Rel and FL-p65 chimeras were inserted into a mammalian expression vector and transiently transfected into CV-1 cells alone or cotransfected with increasing levels of expression vectors encoding either p105 or p98 .
When transfected alone , both FL-c-Rel and FL-65 were confined to the nucleus ( Fig .
7a , b , panels A , B ) .
However , Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Role of p105 and p98 in NF-B signaling Figure 7 .
- p105 and p98 retain p65 and c-Rel in the cytoplasm .
( a ) CV-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding either FL-65 ( A , C , E ) or FL-c-Rel ( B , D , F ) , either alone ( panels A , B ) or in the presence of equimolar amounts ( panels C , D ) or a fourfold molar excess ( panels E , F ) of an expression vector encoding p105 .
As controls , the FL-65 expression vector was cotransfected with a threefold molar excess of an expression vector encoding either p50 ( G ) or MAD-3 ( H ) .
b ) For panels A-F CV-1 cells were transfected exactly as described above ( a ) for A-F , with the single exception that an expression vector encoding p98 was used instead of the p105 vector .
As controls , FL-c-Rel was cotransfected with a threefold molar excess of p55 ( H } or threefold molar excess of both p55 and MAD-3 ( G ) , At 16-24 hr post-transfection the cells were fixed and analyzed by indirect immunofluoresence , as described in Materials and methods , using anti-Flag antibodies .
when cotransfected with equimolar amounts of p98 , FL-c-Rel and FL-65 were partially retained in the cytoplasm ( Fig .
7b , panels C , D ) .
While an equimolar amount of the p105 plasmid caused partial cytoplasmic retention of FL-c-Rel , it had little effect on FL-65 , which remained nuclear ( Fig .
7a , panels C , D ) .
However , cotransfection with a fourfold molar excess of either p105 or p98 led to almost complete cytoplasmic retention of both FL-c-Rel and FL-65 ( Fig .
7a , b , panels E , F ) .
Cotransfection of p50 with FL-65 [ Fig .
7a , panel G ) or p55 with FL-c-Rel ( Fig .
7b , panel H ) had no affect on the nuclear localization of the tagged proteins .
In contrast , cotransfection of a threefold molar excess of MAD-3 with either FL-65 [ Fig .
7a , panel H ) or p55 and FL-c-Rel ( Fig .
7b , panel G ) resulted in the cytoplasmic retention of both tagged proteins .
These findings suggest that both p105 and p98 can function in an `` IxB-like '' capacity , and this process is dependent on the presence of the carboxy-terminal halves of the precursors .
Pulse-chase analysis of p105 and p98 processing Because both p105 and p98 can provide an IxB-like function , it is possible that the subcellular localization of complexes involving either precursor could be regulated , at least in part , by proteolytic processing .
We therefore examined the effect of cell stimulation on the rate of p105 and p98 processing .
Hela S3 cells were pulse-la- GENES & DEVELOPMENT 711 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Mercurio et al .
beled with [ °°S ) methionine for 60 min and chased with cold methionine either in the absence or presence of TPA stimulation .
The levels of °*S-labeled p105 and p98 were determined by immunoprecipitation of denatured cell lysates with either anti-plO5N or anti-p98N .
TPA stimulation led to an increased rate of proteolytic processing for both p105 ( data not shown ) and p98 , as indicated by the appearance of higher amounts of mature products in TPA-stimulated cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
The relative rates of processing of p105 and p98 were compared .
Cells were stimulated with either TPA ( HeLa ) or TPA/Con A { Jurkat } for 1.5 hr , pulse-labeled for 45 min with [ °°S ) methionine , and chased with cold methionine in the presence of continued stimulation .
In stimulated HeLa cells all labeled p105 disappeared within 5 hr [ Fig .
9A ) , whereas only 30 % of the labeled p98 disappeared within the same period ( Fig .
9B ) .
In both cases , decreased levels of the precursors were associated with increased levels of their products .
Interestingly , the level of proteolytic processing was much lower in Jurkat cells for both p105 ( data not shown ) and p98 ( Fig .
9C ) .
The results described in Figure 4 indicated that the majority of c-Rel in Jurkat cells was associated with p98 .
If the p98/c-Rel complexes are precursors for functional p55/c-Rel complexes , they must be processed before nuclear translocation .
We therefore followed the fate of these complexes to determine whether they are processed into potentially active p55/c-Rel complexes .
Jurkat cells were induced with TPA and ConA for 2 hr , metabolically labeled for 1 hr with [ °**S ) methionine , and chased with cold methionine .
Cells were harvested at various time points , lysed in RIPA buffer , and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Rel antibodies .
After dissociation of the immune complexes , secondary immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-p98N .

TPA stimulation increases the rate of p98 processing .
HeLa cells were serum starved for 24 hr , pulse-labeled for 60 min with and chased with cold methionine either in the absence ( lanes 1-6 ) or presence ( lanes 7-12 ) of TPA { 100 ng/tl } .
p98 was immunoprecipitated from SDS-RIPA lysates prepared at the indicated time with anti-p98N .
The antibodies were preincubated with either specific ( SP ) or nonspecific ( NS ) peptide competitors .
Immunoprecipitates were analyzed as described above .
712 GENES & DEVELOPMENT indicated that p98 associated with c-Rel is processed to yield mature p55 ( Fig .
10 } .
This should result in formation of potentially active p55/c-Rel complexes .
In other experiments in which TPA-treated Hela cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions , we found that all of the newly processed p55 was nuclear , whereas p98 remained in the cytoplasm { data not shown ) .
These results are consistent with the Western blot analysis shown above ( Fig .
3C ) .
Discussion NF- « B and related complexes formed by Rel/NF- « B family members are involved in rapid gene activation in response to extracellular signals .
Transcriptional activation by these complexes is regulated in part by their subcellular localization .
Inactive Rel/NF- « B complexes are present in the cytoplasm before cell stimulation , where they are efficiently removed from their nuclear targets .
In response to extracellular stimuli these complexes translocate to the nucleus , where they activate transcription of Rel/NF-kB-responsive genes ( Baeuerle 1991 ; Baeuerle and Baltimore 1991 ) .
One group of proteins responsible for cytoplasmic retention of Rel/NF- « B complexes are the inhibitors .
Release of Rel/NF- « B complexes from binding to I « B is a signal-dependent event , thought to involve the direct phosphorylation of IxB ( Shirakawa and Mizel 1989 ; Ghosh and Baltimore 1990 ; Kerr et al .
1991 ) .
However , a direct proof that the association of any IxB molecule with Rel/NF- « B complexes is regulated by phosphorylation in vivo is yet to be provided .
The work presented above demonstrates the existence of a second pathway whereby extracellular stimuli can affect the in-tracellular location of Rel/NF- « B complexes in the absence of I « B ( Fig .
11 ) .
We show that both p105 and p98 precursor proteins can associate with other Rel/NF- « B family members in vitro and in vivo .
This association can result in cytoplasmic retention of either c-Rel or p65 and possibly other family members .
Cell stimulation with TPA results in increased processing of both p105 and p98 leading to formation of their p50 and p55 prod-ucts , respectively .
Because these proteins can no longer retain p65 or c-Rel in the cytoplasm , this should result in the formation of active Rel/NF- « B complexes free to undergo nuclear translocation .
While this manuscript was being reviewed , Rice et al .
[ 1992 ] reported similar findings with p105 .
In vitro both p105 and p98 can form stable complexes with various Rel/NF- « B proteins , analogously to their products p50 and p55 ( Gilmore 1991 ; Blank et al .
1992 ) , In particular , p105 and p98 can associate with p50 , p55 , p65 , c-Rel , and each other ( Table 1 ) .
Formation of similar complexes in vivo was demonstrated by sequential immunoprecipitations using subunit-specific antibodies .
All of these complexes are very stable , surviving multiple immunoprecipitations done under relatively stringent conditions .
The possibility of subunit exchange was examined by challenging the p98/FL-65 heterocomplex with a 10-fold excess of p55 , and no subunit exchange was found [ J. DiDonato , unpubl . ) .

( Blank et al .
1991 ; Henkel et al .
1992 } , p105 is an exclusively cytoplasmic protein ( F. Mercurio and C. Rosette , unpubl .
) , and by indirect immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies we found that p98 is also restricted to the cytoplasm ( Fig .
3C ; F. Mercurio and C. Rosette , unpubl . ) .
This implies that any complexes containing either p105 or p98 must also be cytoplasmic .
By virtue of their cytoplasmic localization , p105 and p98 can provide an IKB-like function , leading to the cytoplasmic retention of otherwise nuclear proteins , such as p50 , p65 , or c-Rel .
This proposal was substantiated by transfection experiments using constructs encoding p65 , c-Rel , p98 , and pl05 .
Immunofluorescence analysis of epitope-tagged p65 and c-Rel indicated that in the absence of cotransfected p105 or p98 , both tagged proteins were pre-dominately nuclear .
However , expression of increasing amounts of either p98 or p105 led to cytoplasmic retention of both p65 and c-Rel .
Cytoplasmic retention of c-Rel or p65 by p98 or p105 appeared to be as complete as the retention achieved upon cotransfection of a MAD-3 expression vector , Cotransfection with expression vectors encoding the processed forms of p105 or p98 did not affect the nuclear localization of either c-Rel or p65 .
Therefore , the carboxy terminal domains of either p105 or p98 are required for their cytoplasmic retention function .
IkB proteins are composed primarily of SWIG6/ankyrin repeats [ Blank et al .
1992 } .
Recent studies suggest that IB proteins retain Rel/NF- « B complexes in the cytoplasm by masking the nuclear transfer signals ( NTS ) within the Rel homology domains ( Beg et al .
1992 ) .
This interaction is likely to be mediated by the SW1I6/ankyrin repeats ( Blank et al .
1992 ) .
A similar function was proposed for the IxBy protein , which is produced by alternative splicing of the primary p105 transcript ( Inoue et al .
1992 ) .
IxBy consists mostly of the carboxy terminal domain of p105 , containing its SWIG6/ankyrin repeats , and can inhibit p50/p65 DNA binding in vitro and pre- TIME : 0 h 1h 2 h 4h 11h [ i I I I I I 1 '' Abs 0 ; ac-Rel | 2 Ab : 0 ; ap9BN 1 Comp : [ ns se Ins sp Ins sp I ns sp I ns spl MW < 4- p98 97 l *e se © q one 69 46 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Figure 10 .

Final immunoprecipitates were analyzed as described above .
As noticed earlier , a small amount of c-Rel reprecipitated with p98/p55 most likely due to reassociation after dilution of the denatured lysate before immunoprecipitation .

Proteolysis Cyt Phosphorylation Figure 11 .
- Alternative pathways for activation of cytoplasmic NF- « B/Rel complexes .
One pathway involves the proteolysis of a p98 or p105 precursor whose carboxy-terminal domain containing IxB-like repeats prevents the recognition of the NTS of both subunits ( The interaction with the NTS is based on the recent work of Beg et al .
1992 . )
The other , more conventional , pathway is thought to involve the phosphorylation of IB , which prevents the recognition of the NTS while bound to the NF- « B/Rel complex ( phosphorylation of IxB in vivo is yet to be demonstrated ) .
The liberated complexes display their NTS and can undergo nuclear transfer .
vent the nuclear translocation in vivo of the heterocom-plex .
The cytoplasmic retention of p65 and c-Rel by p105 and p98 , described here , is unlikely to be the result of the production of IxBy or a similiar derivative of p98 because such proteins were not detected under our experimental conditions ( see Figs .
3 and 9 ; F. Mercurio , unpubl . ) .
Re-cently , Henkel et .
al .
( 1992 ) proposed an intramolecular masking model , whereby the SWIG6/ankyrin repeats of p105 act indirectly to prevent its nuclear transfer by providing an extension that allows a remote carboxy-terminal domain to fold back and mask the NTS and dimerization motifs within the Rel homology domain .
In part , that model was based on the failure of a particular anti-p105 carboxy-terminal antiserum to coprecipitate p65 with p105 .
It is possible that this particular antiserum is incapable of recognizing p105/p65 complexes because of steric hinderance between p65 and the antigenic epitope .
Our results using two different anti-p105 antisera , directed against either amino- or carboxy-terminal sequences clearly demonstrate that this protein is associated with p65 and other Rel/NF- « B family members , such as c-Rel , p55/p98 , and p50 , in vivo .
Similar experiments demonstrated the association of p98 with c-Rel , p65 , and p50/p105 ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , it is unlikely that the carboxy-terminal region of either precursor folds back on its Rel domains and inhibits its interactions with other family members .
It is more likely that the carboxy-terminal halves of either p105 and p98 , which are both similar in their repeat structure to IxB , provide an IxB-like function and prevent recognition of the NTS of both subunits ( see Fig .
11 } .
The SWIG6/ankyrin repeats may also anchor the complex to a cytoplasmic structure , providing an additional mechanism for cytoplasmic retention .
Having demonstrated that p105 and p98 are capable of 714 GENES & DEVELOPMENT associating with Rel/NF-KkB proteins leading to their cytoplasmic retention , we investigated whether the state of these complexes is affected by extracellular stimuli .
In theory , proteolytic processing of the precursors , which removes their carboxy-terminal IxB-like domains , should result in either the liberation of an active complex from its restricted cytoplasmic localization or reveal its NTS .
Either way , nuclear localization should en-sue .
Regulated proteolytic processing could control the level and composition of Rel/NF- « B complexes undergoing nuclear translocation , as well as affect the kinetics of this process .
Alternatively , the liberated complexes may encounter IkB molecules and remain cytoplasmic until a proper extracellular signal leads to their dissociation from IB .
Riviere et al .
( 1991 ) have shown that the human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) protease can process p105 , leading to increased levels of active nuclear NF- « B complex .
We found that TPA stimulation of both HeLa and Jurkat cells increases the rate of processing of both precursors .
At this point , we do not know whether this is the result of increased activity of the processing protease or a post-translational modification of the precursors , which increases their susceptibility to processing .
Alternatively , the efficacy of the processing reaction could increase in response to the elevated concentrations of the precursors , whose synthesis is TPA inducible ( Bours et al .
1990,1992 ; Mercurio et al .
1992 ) .
Fan and Maniatis ( 1991 ) demonstrated that an ATP-dependent protease is responsible for p105 processing .
It remains to be determined whether the same activity is responsible for the processing of p98 .
We found that the kinetics of total p98 processing were not significantly different from those of the population of p98 associated with c-Rel .
This suggests that the processing protease does not discriminate between uncomplexed p98 , if it exists , c-Rel-complexed p98 , and p98 complexed with other family members .
The rate of p98 processing was sufficiently slow to cause a prolonged release of supposedly active p55/c-Rel complexes .
These slow processing kinetics fit the recently described kinetics of nuclear translocation of c-Rel ( Tan et al .
1992 ) or the appearance of c-Rel-containing-NF- « B complexes ( Ballard et al .
1990 ) .
It is likely that the delayed nuclear translocation of c-Rel-containing complexes is regulated at the level of proteolytic processing of p98 , as the latter appears to be an abundant c-Rel-associated protein and the p98/c-Rel complexes are particularly stable .
In addition , cell fractionation experiments suggest that once p55 is generated by the processing of p98 , it enters the nucleus rather rapidly , because all of the detectable p55 was found to be confined to the nuclear fraction ( Fig .
3C ; data not shown ) .
The rate and extent of processing of both precursors was considerably different between Jurkat and HeLa cells .
Both p105 and p98 displayed lower relative levels of processing in Jurkat cells compared with Hela $ 3 cells .
Differential cell-type levels of proteolytic processing in response to extracellular stimuli should determine the relative contribution of the proteolytic pathway versus the IxB-mediated pathway to induction of NF- « B ac Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press tivity ( Fig .
11 ) .
We propose that the cell exploits a regulated proteolytic processing event to further modulate the nuclear translocation of Rel/NF- « B complexes .
Neri et .
al .
( 1991 ) have recently identified a B-cell chromosomal translocation involving p98 ( Iyt-10 } , generating a lyt-10/Ca-1 fusion gene that retains the Rel homology domain but lacks the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain .
This fusion protein displays similar characteristics to the normal p55 protein .
The inability of this protein to retain either itself or other family members , such as c-Rel , in the cytoplasm may be responsible for its oncogenic potential .

( 1983 ) , with the following modifications : Isolated nuclei were gently washed in hypotonic buffer made 0.02 % NP-40 , and the nuclear pellet was then resuspended in the same buffer and pelleted through a 50 % sucrose cushion made in hypotonic buffer .
Cytoplasmic ( 50 ug ) and nuclear ( 25 ug ) extracts were fractionated on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon paper for Western blot analysis .
The blot was incubated with a 1 : 400 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 715 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Mercurio et al .
dilution of anti-p9I8N antiserum , which was preincubated with either a specific or nonspecific peptide competitor , The blot was then developed with the ECL Western blotting detection system ( Amersham ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Immunofluorescence All manipulations were carried out at room temperature according to standard procedures ( Harlow and Lane 1988 ) .
Fixed cells ( in 4 % paraformaldehyde ) were washed in PBS - 5 mm glycine , permeabilized in PBS + 0.3 % Triton X-100 ( 8 min } , and saturated in PBS + 1 % gelatin and 1 % BSA { 15 min ) .
Binding of the primary antibody was for 1 hr using 1.0 pg/ml of anti-Flag antibodies ( M2 antibodies , IBI ) .
After four washes with PBS , either thodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody ( Cap-pel ) was applied for 30 min followed by several washes with PBS and nuclear staining with 0.0001 % DAPI { 10 min ) .
The slides were mounted in Mowiol mounting solution , viewed on a fluorescent light microscope , and photographed .

Note added in proof At a recent meeting sponsored by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , a new nomenclature for the NF-xB/Rel family of proteins was suggested .
Our study was completed and submitted before the new nomenclature system was decided on .
However , consistent with the suggestions at the meeting , the designations of the NF- « B/Rel proteins should be as follows : p105/p50 is NF-kB1 ; p100/p52 { p49 } , also known as p98/p55 , is NF-kB2 , ; v-Rel , c-Rel , RelB , and Dorsal remain the same ; p65 is RelA .
In the IxB molecules , MAD-3 , pp40 , and RL-IFl are to be referred to as IxBa ; IxBy , Bcl-3 , and IBB remain the same .
