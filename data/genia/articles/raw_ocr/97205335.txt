Department of Immunology and Inflammation 14 Cambridge Center Cambridge , Massachusetts 02142 Summary A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , designated TRAMP , has been identi-fied .
The structural organization of the 393 amino acid long human TRAMP is most homologous to TNF receptor 1 .
TRAMP is abundantly expressed on thymocytes and lymphocytes .
Its extracellular domain is composed of four cysteine-rich domains , and the cytoplasmic region contains a death domain known to signal apoptosis .
Overexpression of TRAMP leads to two major responses , NF- « B activation and apoptosis .
TRAMP-induced cell death is inhibited by an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases , but not by Bel-2 .
In addition , TRAMP does not appear to interact with any of the known apoptosis-inducing ligands of the TNF family .
Introduction The tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -related cytokines have emerged over recent years as a large family of pleiotropic mediators of host defense and immune regulation ( Smith et al. , 1994 ) .
A parallel family of receptors mediates the initiation of , among other things , cell death , proliferation , anti-viral activities , and differentiation ( Smith et al. , 1994 ; Ware et al. , 1996 ) .
In mammals , ten receptors have been identified , NGFR , TNF receptor 1 ( TNFR1 ) , TNFR2 , LTBR , CD40 , CD30 , CD27 , 4-1BB , OX 40 , and ( CD95 ) , which can interact with some eight TNF-related ligands .
*These authors contributed equally to this work .
The receptor members of this family are type I membrane molecules and are structurally homologous : each contains in its extracellular domain three to six imperfect repeats of approximately 40 residues , each containing approximately six cysteines ( Ware et al. , 1996 ) .
A single domain is formed by six B-sheets in which the cysteines are arranged in a typical 1-3 , 2-4 , 5-6 pattern ( Banner et al. , 1993 ) .
The cytoplasmic domains generally lack sequence homology , with the exception of a motif called the `` death domain '' found in TNFR1 and Fas ( Feinstein et al. , 1995 ; Hofmann and Tschopp , 1995 ; Tartaglia et al. , 1993b ; Watanabe et al. , 199223 ) .
Both of these receptors efficiently transmit death signals , initiated through association of TNFR1-associated death domain protein ( TRADD ) and Fas-associating protein with death domain ( FADD ) ( Boldin et al. , 1995b ; Chinnaiyan et al. , 1995 ) , respectively , which connect the receptors to interleukin-1B-converting enzyme ( ICE ) -like cysteine proteases via FLICE/MACH ( Boldin et al. , 1996 ; Muzio et al. , 1996 ) .
The aspartate-specific proteases are implicated as mediators of most types of apoptotic cell death ( Dixit , 1996 ; Henkart , 1996 ; Kumar , 1995 ) .
The ligand members are type II membrane molecules .
Their extracellular domains have B jelly-roll topography ( Banner et al. , 1993 ) and are important in ligand trimeri-zation .
Intrinsic to oligomerization is the formation of the receptor-binding site at the junction between neighboring subunits creating a multivalent ligand .
The binding of the ligands to their respective receptors induces oligomerization initiating downstream signaling events .
Except for the recently described ligand TRAIL ( for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ) ( Pitti et al. , 1996 ; Wiley et al. , 1995 ) , receptors have been identified for all members of the TNF ligand family ( Smith et al. , 1994 ) .
Similar to Fas ligand ( FasL ) , recombinant TRAIL can induce cell death in a broad range of cells ( Wiley et al. , 1995 ) , suggesting that the structure of the corresponding receptor may show sequence homology to receptors known to induce apoptosis , i.e. , Fas and TNFR1 .
There-fore , we have screened public databases for the presence of such a molecule and report here the characterization of a novel receptor displaying highest sequence homology with TNFR1 .
We show that this receptor , coined TRAMP , can elicit biological activities similar to those described for TNFR1 ( Tartaglia et al. , 1993a ) , ranging from activation of transcription factors to the induction of cell death .
However , TRAMP does not appear to be the cognate receptor of TRAIL or any member of the TNF ligand family known to trigger cell death .
Results Identification of TRAMP We reasoned that the receptor interacting with TRAIL most likely contains the typical TNF receptor cysteine-rich domain and searched the dbEST database using an improved profile search ( Bucher et al. , 1996 ) based on an optimal alignment of all family members .

Predicted Amino Acid Sequence of TRAMP and Its Homology to Fas and TNFR1 Colinear amino acid sequence alignment of human TRAMP , TNFR1 , and Fas .
Sequence numbering starts at the N-terminus of the predicted mature protein .
The cysteine-rich domains ( I-IV ) , the predicted transmembrane segment { ( TM ) , and the death domain ( DD ) are indicated .
The C-terminus of the alternatively spliced form giving rise to the soluble form of TRAMP is marked with an arrow ( stop ) .
In the four clones coding for the short version of TRAMP , the leucine was replaced by a proline at position 143 .
Identical and similar residues are represented in closed and shaded boxes , respectively .
a brain cDNA library and one in a fetal lung cDNA library .
Sequence analysis revealed that the 5'-end sequences of the clones were identical .
The four shorter clones predicted a soluble receptor that consisted of three and a half cysteine repeat units with a stop codon after 157 amino acids , with no indication of a hydrophobic transmembrane region ( Figure 1 ) .
In contrast , the longer clone ( 1.7 kb ) contained an open reading frame capable of coding a sequence of 393 amino acids for the mature protein , preceded by hydrophobic amino acids typical of a signal peptide .
The predicted extracellular domain included four complete TNFR folds , followed by a putative transmembrane segment and a 193 amino acid long cytoplasmic domain .
Moreover , a region with homology to the death domain previously found to be important in signaling cell death ( Itoh and Nagata , 1993 ; Tartaglia et al. , 1993b ) was detected close to the C-terminus .
The overall sequence of this novel receptor , which we designate TRAMP ( for TNF receptor-related apoptosis-mediating protein ) is most similar to TNFR1 ( 22.5 % identical residues ) , followed by Fas ( 14 % ; Figure 1 ) .
Highest sequence similarity was found in the region of the death domain , in which 40 % of the residues are identical between TRAMP and TNFR1 .
Expression of TRAMP The expression of TRAMP was studied by Northern blot analysis ( Figure 2A ) .
A transcript of 3.2 kb was detected in lymphocyte-rich tissues such as the thymus , colon , intestine , and spleen .
TRAMP mRNA was also found in the prostate , whereas other tissues tested were neg-ative .
TRAMP expression within organs was studied in more detail in mice ( Figure 2B ) .
In bone marrow , the transcript size heterogeneity was considerable as four prominent cross-hybridizing mRNAs were detectable migrating at approximately 1.0 , 1.6 , 3.4 , and 4.5 kb .
The 1.0 kb was the major transcript detected in stromal cells of the spleen .
Purified splenocytes , however , expressed mostly the 1.6 kb and 4.8 kb message .
In thymocytes , the larger transcript ( s ) was most abundantly expressed .
Interestingly , the 1.0 kb message was selectively up-regulated in Fas-deficient Ipr mice .
Characterization of the TRAMP Protein In agreement with the Northern blot analysis , highest levels of the TRAMP protein were found in activated T lymphocytes .
Polyclonal antibodies generated against the N-terminal sequence of TRAMP reacted with a protein of approximately 56 kDa , in agreement with the size of recombinant TRAMP overexpressed in 29317 cells , present in various human cell lines of epithelial , neu-ronal , and lymphocytic origin ( Figure 3 ) .
Similar to the related Fas and TNF receptors , TRAMP is most likely glycosylated , as the predicted molecular mass is 42.9 kDa .
Differences in glycosylation may also explain the variations and heterogeneity of the molecular size among different cells .
In peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) , for example , bands of 56 and 53 kDa were seen , while in melanoma cell lines and U937 , proteins of 56 and 59 kDa were detectable , respectively .
It is noteworthy that TRAMP expression in PBLs declined after prolonged stimulation with the lectin PHA and interleukin-2 .
TRAMP Activates NF- « B An important response induced by TNFR1 is the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB .
This activity is initiated by the oligomerization of the death domain of TRAMP , an Apoptosis-Signaling Receptor 81 A HC 5510 $ 09 , a x 6623 « $ & 0° CS » .s 6 & 0 & « Q » & .s 8.8 so CEs F SSCA $ « $ on $ & $ & 4.4 - ' E # 24 1.3 o af B 00434 4° ad © C oa y © 0 6 $ @ % Q\ & f © .C & '' $ 2 [ & 8 S & C & C & © .C 3 $ of & & 1.8-1.8- aas Figure 2 .

To investigate a possible activation of the signaling pathway leading to NF-kB activation , we transiently transfected 2931 cells with a TNF promoter-derived NF- « B-luciferase reporter gene and increasing amounts of the TRAMP expression vector .
TRAMP expression strongly induced the activity of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent fashion ( Figure 4 ) .
In the presence of an inhibitor of apoptosis ( see below ) , an increase in luciferase activity of up to 25-fold was measured .

TRAMP Signals Apoptosis The second signaling pathway triggered by the death domain of TNFR1 ( and Fas ) is that leading to apoptosis .
To investigate a possible role of TRAMP in apoptosis , we transiently overexpressed TRAMP in 293T cells .
Most of the transfected cells abundantly expressed TRAMP ( Figure 5A ) .
When their morphology was examined by phase-contrast microscopy 24 hr after transfection , cells had rounded up and had undergone morphological changes typical of apoptosis ( Figure 5B ) .
In contrast , cells transfected with an empty control vector retained their flat adherent appearance .
Inhibitors of ICE-like proteases such as crmA encoded by the cowpox virus or synthetic peptides can block TNF and FasL-induced apoptosis ( Los et al. , 1995 ; Tewari and Dixit , 1995 ) .
When 293T cells were transiently transfected with TRAMP in the presence of zVAD-fmk , an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases , cells retained their viable appearance .
In contrast , cotransfection of the be/-2 cDNA ( Borner et al. , 1994 ) with the TRAMP expression plasmid did not rescue cells from death .
A biochemical hallmark of apoptosis is the degradation of nuclear DNA into oligonucleosome-sized fragments ( Peitsch et al. , 1993 ; Russell , 1983 ) , and indeed TRAMP-expressing cells had fragmented nuclear DNA Figure 3 .

( C ) DNA fragmentation of TRAMP-transfected cells ( see [ B ] ) was analyzed by the determination of cytoplasmic histone-containing DNA complexes .
( Figure 5C ) .
Taken together , these results are consistent with the interpretation that TRAMP-induced apoptosis involves the activation of ICE-like proteases , leading to the morphological and biochemical changes typical of apoptosis .
The Death Domain of TRAMP Homo-Oligomerizes and Can Recruit FADD The downstream effector molecules that induce Fas-mediated apoptosis are FADD and FLICE ( for FADD-like ICE ) ( Boldin et al. , 1996 ; Muzio et al. , 1996 ) .
FADD is a typical linker protein with a N-terminal death domain binding to the death domain of oligomerized Fas and a C-terminal death effector domain interacting with the death effector domain of FLICE .
The C-terminus of FLICE , in turn , contains an ICE-like cysteine protease coupling FAS to the ICE proteases .
This led us to examine whether FADD can associate with TRAMP .
The Flag-tagged cytoplasmic domain of TRAMP ( amino acids 197-393 ) was cotransfected with a FADD expression vector in 293T cells .
Immunoprecipitation of Flag , TRAMP revealed that FADD associated with TRAMP ( Figure 6A ) .
Compared with parallel experiments using the Flag-tagged cytoplasmic region of Fas and FADD , however , the interaction of TRAMP with FADD appeared to be less efficient ( data not shown ) and was detectable only at very high FADD expression levels .
These data suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of TRAMP can recruit FADD .
It remains to be determined , however , whether TRAMP directly associates with FADD or whether TRAMP-FADD complex formation is mediated by ( endogenous ) TRADD , as seen for TNFR1 .
Transfection of the expression vector coding for the cytoplasmic region of TRAMP into 293T cells was also used to investigate a possible homo-aggregation of TRAMP .
The fact that TRAMP overexpression leads to the initiation of cell death in the absence of the ligand suggested that overexpression of TRAMP most likely results in the oligomerization of the cytoplasmic region , as aggregation of the death domain is thought to be the crucial trigger of the apoptotic signal pathway ( Boldin et al. , 1995a ; Krammer et al. , 1994 ; Nagata and Golstein , 1995 ) .
To this end , two expression vectors , both coding for the identical cytoplasmic region of TRAMP but carrying two distinct tag epitopes ( Myc and Flag ) were cotransfected into 293T cells .
Figure 6B shows that TRAMP forms homo-aggregates , whereas interaction with the cytoplasmic region of Fas was not detectable .
TRAMP Does Not Appear to Be the Receptor of TRAIL , TNFa , LTa1B2 , or FasL To determine whether TRAMP is the receptor of one of the known ligands of the TNF family , the extracellular domain of TRAMP was fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 ( IigG1 ) ( TRAMP-Fc ) .
The forced di-merization of the extracellular region of TNFR-like receptors was previously shown to result in a considerable increase of affinity for the respective ligands such that ligand-receptor interactions of the TNF family members can be studied in vitro ( Byrn et al. , 1990 ) .
The TRAMP-Fc and , for comparison , the Fc hybrids of human and mouse Fas ( mFas and hFas ) ( Itoh et al. , 1991 ; Watanabe et al. , 1992b ) , mouse lymphotoxin B receptor ( mLTBR ) ( Browning et al. , 1993 , 1996 ) , and human TNFR1 ( ATNFR1 ) ( Loetscher et al. , 1990 ) were coated onto wells of microtiter plates , and an assortment of the soluble version ( without membrane anchor ) of TNF ligand family members was added to test for possible binding .
As expected , strong interaction was found between hTNFa and mTNFR1-Fc , hFasL and human or mouse Fas-Fc , and hLTa1B2 and mLTBR-Fc ( Figure 7A ) .
In contrast , TRAMP-Fe did not show affinity for any ligand , including the orphan ligand TRAIL .
Since anti-TRAMP antibodies recognized the TRAMP-Fc hybrid , we excluded the possibility that coating of the wells with TRAMP-Fc was inefficient and responsible for the inability to detect a binding partner .
This set of experiments also revealed that TRAIL had no detectable affinity for any of the other receptor-Fc constructs tested .
Finally , the expression levels of TRAMP and TRAIL receptors were compared in various cell lines .
In melanoma cell lines , expression of both TRAMP and TRAIL receptors was comparably high , while no correlation was found in Jurkat T lymphomas ( and various other TRAMP , an Apoptosis-Signaling Receptor 83 A Flag-TRAMP + + + + FADD + + + + 88 49 ms -- ume 33 ._ oe e Rw < c 39 .

293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged TRAMP ( 5 pg ) and FADD ( 2 g ) , and the FADD expression levels were assayed in cell lysates using a monoclonal anti-FADD antibody .
The cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies ( precipitating TRAMP ) , and the presence of coprecipitating FADD was assessed by Western blot analysis using an anti-FADD antibody .

Immunoprecipitates of cell extracts using an anti-Flag antibody ( precipitating Flag-TRAMP ) were analyzed by Western blot and revealed with an anti-Myc antibody to detect coprecipitating Myc-TRAMP or Myc-Fas , respectively ( right panel ) .
It is noteworthy that TRAMP oligomers appeared to be extremely stable , since they were partially resistant to dissociation even in the presence of boiling SDS ( see bands > 50 kDa ) .
cell lines ; data not shown ) , in which high TRAIL receptor but only marginal TRAMP expression was detectable ( Figure 7B ) .
Taken together , these results do not support the possibility that TRAMP is the receptor of TRAIL .
Chromosomal Localization of TRAMP The chromosomal localization of the TRAMP gene was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis ( Figure 8 ) .
Under the condition used , the hybridization efficiency of the TRAMP probe was approximately 91 % ( among 100 mitotic figures checked , 91 showed signals on one pair of the chromosome ) .
TRAMP was assigned to the long arm of human chromosome 1 , region p36.2 .
Hence , the TRAMP gene is localized to a region where other receptors ( CD30R , TNFR2 , OXA40R ) and ligands ( 4-1BB ) of the TNF family have been mapped , indicating that these genes are clustered .
Another gene cluster of TNF family members is found on chromosome 12 ( CD27R , 12p13 ; LTBR , 12p13 ; TNFR1 , 12p13.2 ) , whereas the genes coding for Fas , TNFR1 , and nerve growth factor receptor ( NGFR ) are distributed on various other chromosomes ( e.g. , Fas , 10g24.1 ; CD40R , 20q12 ; and NGFR , 17421 ) .
Discussion We have characterized a novel member of the TNF receptor family , designated TRAMP .
Like most members of the TNF receptor family , the extracellular domain of TRAMP contains repeats of cysteine-rich domains that are known to be crucial for the interaction with its cognate ligand .
TRAMP is the fourth member of the TNF receptor family ( TNFR1 , Fas , NGFR ) that contains a death domain in the cytoplasmic region .
Its percentage amino acid identity with the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of TNFR1 and Fas is 29 % and 24 % , respectively ( for comparison , Fas and TNFR1 have 22 % identical amino acids ) .
In the death domain , the sequence homology between TRAMP and TNFR1 is highest ( 40 % ) .
TRAMP expression is found predominantly in tissues with a high content of lymphocytes .
Of the cells and cell lines tested , TRAMP was abundantly expressed on activated lymphocytes and in thymocytes .
Thus , TRAMP may be involved in the regulation of lymphocyte cell number , the negative selection of thymocytes , or both .
Two distinct cDNAs were found that code for TRAMP .
One transcript includes a stop codon after the third of six cysteines of the fourth repeat , at a position where the boundary between exons 5 and 6 is located in the TNFR1 gene ( Fuchs et al. , 1992 ) .
Although there is currently no evidence for the existence of such a soluble protein , it would be predicted to act as a secreted inhibitor of TRAMP-TRAMP ligand interaction .
Two other members of the TNF receptor family , both of poxvirus origin , also exist as soluble receptors .
T2 and A53 function to complex host-produced TNF ( Smith et al. , 1991 ) .
T2 is an acquired form of TNFR2 , while A53 shows much lower sequence homology and may represent a third TNF receptor .
The fatal virulence of wild-type myxoma poxvirus is reduced by nearly 50 % in viral mutants only differing by an inactivated T2 gene ( Upton et al. , 1991 ) .
It will therefore be interesting to identify and characterize the soluble TRAMP form .
Interestingly , a short transcript that possibly corresponds to the soluble receptor TRAMP is highly up-regulated in mice that lack a functional Fas .
The cytoplasmic region of TRAMP contains a death domain , which has previously been shown to signal cell death and NF- « B activation .
Natural or artificial mutations in this region disrupt the ability of Fas and TNFR1 to initiate these signals ( Nagata , 1994 ; Tartaglia et al. , 1993b ) .
It was therefore not surprising that overexpression of TRAMP both potently induced proinflammatory activity and cell death .
Overexpression of TNFR1 has previously been shown to trigger NF-kB activation in a ligand-independent manner ( Smith et al. , 1994 ) .

TRAMP Does Not Appear to Be the Receptor of Known Apoptosis-Inducing Ligands of the TNF Family ( A ) Interaction of TNF ligand and receptor family members .
Wells of microtiter plates were coated with fusion proteins of the indicated TNF receptor family members with human immunoglobulin Fo ( rec-Fc ) .
Binding of the tagged ligands was determined by the addition of anti-tag antibodies ( anti-Flag for for FasL , TRAIL , and TNFa ; anti-Myc for LTa1B2 ) .
Efficient coating with TRAMP-Fc was verified using a polyclonal anti- TRAMP antibody .
In the control panel , no ligand was included in the assay .
( B ) Comparison of TRAMP and TRAIL receptor surface expression .
The distribution of TRAIL receptor and TRAMP ( and for comparison Fas and TNFRs ) were compared in Me260 ( Melanoma ) and Jurkat ( T cell lymphoma ) cell lines .
Surface expression of Fas , TNFRs , and TRAIL receptor was analyzed by flow cytometry using tagged FasL , TNFa , and TRAIL , respectively .
TRAMP expression was detected using the polyclonal antibody AL104 .
in aggregation of the cytoplasmic region , therefore allowing direct complex formation with downstream signaling partners .
Akin to TRADD-induced activation of NF- « B ( Hsu et al. , 1995 ) , activation of the NF-kB reporter gene was best demonstrated when the cell death pathway was inhibited , indicating that the cell death pathway and the one leading to the proinflammatory response are distinct .
Whether TRAMP-induced NF- « B activation is mediated by TRADD remains to be determined .
TRAMP is also a potent inducer of cell death .
Similar to Fas , TRAMP is able to recruit FADD upon overexpres-sion , and it is reasonable to infer that TRAMP-com-plexed FADD is able to bind FLICE or the FLICE homolog Mch4 ( Fernandesalnemri et al. , 1996 ) .
TRAMP -triggered cell death is blocked by zVAD-fmk , which is a potent inhibitor of ICE-like proteases , including FLICE ( M. T. , data not shown ) .
In contrast , Bcl-2 , a potent inhibitor of other forms of signals causing apoptosis ( UV , growth factor withdrawal , etc . )
( Hawkins and Vaux , 1994 ; Korsmeyer , 1995 ) was ineffective , in agreement with its variable inhibitory activity on the Fas pathway ( Schroter et al. , 1995 ; Strasser et al. , 1995 ) .
The possible interaction of TNF family members known to induce cell death with TRAMP was assayed using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , based assay .
While strong signals were obtained with TRAMP , an Apoptosis-Signaling Receptor 85 Chromosome 1 known ligands , no signal above background was measured with TRAMP , suggesting that these members of the TNF family , and in particular TRAIL , can not bind TRAMP .
These results were supported by the fact that TRAIL receptor and TRAMP expression differed in various cell lines tested .
However , this conclusion has to be taken with caution .
The most conserved region , the cytoplasmic death domain , is highly homologous to the corresponding region of TNFR1 , and therefore the existence of heterotrimeric receptors , consisting of , for example , TNFR1 ; TRAMP ; , can not be excluded .
LTo1B2 may be considered the prototype of such a hetero-oligo-mer in the TNF ligand family .
If such a mixed receptor association exists in vivo , the assay system used here would have failed to detect it .
Still , the most likely explanation is that the ligand of TRAMP is a novel member of the TNF ligand family , which , when identified , may provide new insights into the pleiotropic biological activities of this family of ligands and receptors .

Human TNFR1-Fc and human LTBR-Fc were made as described previously ( Crowe et al. , 1994 ) .
The FADD expression plasmid ( pcDNA3 ) was a gift of Dr. Martinou ( Glaxo , Geneva ) .
The extracellular domain of TRAMP , encompassing residues 1-175 , was amplified by PCR using the proofreading DNA polymer-ase Pwo ( Boehringer ) using a specific 5 ' forward primer flanked by a BamHI site ( 5'-TCCGGATCCCAGGGCGGCACTCGT-3 ' ) and a 3 ' reverse primer flanked by a Sall site ( 5'-GTCGACCTGCCTCCAGCC ACAG-3 ' ) .
The amplification product was cloned into the pCRII vector ( Invitrogen ) and then subcloned in an expression vector containing the pCMV promoter ( PCRIII ; Invitrogen ) as a BamHI-Sall insert in-frame behind the signal sequence of the heavy chain of the immunoglobulin { Ig ) and in front of a Sall-Not !
fragment containing the cDNA of the hinge , C , ,3 and C , ,4 domains of the human IgG1 ( Fc domain } .
This strategy resulted in the generation of a full-length , highly expressed secreted TRAMP-Fc molecule .
Monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting include the following : an anti-Flag antibody and anti-Flag agarose ( Kodak International Biotechnologies ) , an anti-FADD antibody directed against amino acids 94-208 of human FADD ( Transduction Laboratories ) , and an antibody against the Myc epi-tope ( 9E10 ; provided by R. Iggo , ISREC ) .
Antiserum against TRAMP was generated against a peptide spanning amino acids 1-23 of the mature TRAMP ( QGGTRSPRCDCAGDFHKKIGLFC ) synthesized using the multiple antigen technology ( Francis et al. , 1991 ) .
The antiserum ( AL104 ) was affinity purified on the TRAMP peptide coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B ( Pharmacia ) .
Cloning of TRAMP cDNA Several EST clones that potentially encoded a novel member of the TNF receptor family were identified in the dbEST database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information by performing a database search using generalized profile method ( Bucher et al. , 1996 ) based on the sequence homology among TNF receptor family members .
Four of the clones ( insert size 0.6-0.8 kb ) were derived from an adult brain cDNA library ( GenBank accession numbers H46378 , Immunity 86 H41851 , H49675 , and H41522 ) ; the longest clone ( 1.7 kb ; GenBank accession number N71141 ) was from a fetal lung cDNA library .
The inserts were sequenced by conventional methods , and the resulting sequences were aligned .
Northern Blot Analysis Northern blot analysis was performed by using human multiple tissue Northen blots | and II ( Clontech 7760-1 and 7759-1 ) or by resolution of total RNA from mouse cells ( Wilson et al. , 1996 ) on 1.4 % agarose gels containing 18 % formaldehyde and blotting onto Hybond-N membrane ( Amersham ) .
The membrane was preincu-bated in hybridization solution ( 50 % formamide , 2.5 % Denhardt 's solution , 0.2 % SDS , 10 mM EDTA , 2x SSC [ pH 7.0 ] , 50 mM NaH , PO , [ pH 6.5 ] , 200 pg/ml boiled and sonicated herring sperm DNA ) for at least 4 hr at hybridization temperature ( 60°C ) .
The heat-denatured antisense RNA probe was added at 1.5 x 10° cpm per milliliter in fresh hybridization solution .
The membrane was incubated 12-24 hr at 65°C and washed at least three times with increasing stringency and exposed at -70°C .
Construction of TRAMP Expression Vectors The full-length TRAMP was amplified using the Pwo DNA polymer-ase using a specific 5 ' forward primer flanked by a BamHI site ( 5'-TCCGGATCCCAGGGCGGCACTCGT-3 ' ) and a specific 3 ' reverse primer flanked by an Xbal site ( 5'-GACTCTAGACGCCTAGGT GGCAAGT-3 ' ) .
The amplified fragment was cut with BamH ! |-Xbal and cloned into a modified version of pCRIII ( Invitrogen ) in-frame with the signal peptide of the heavy chain of IgG .
The cytoplasmic domain of TRAMP { amino acids 197-393 ) was PCR amplified using the two primers 5'-GAATTCACCTACACATACCGC-3 ' and 5'-CTCGAGTCACGGGCCGCGCTG-3 ' containing an EcoRl and Xhol site , respectively , and subcloned into a modified pCRIII vector in-frame with an N-terminal Flag epitope .
Cell Lysis , Coimmunoprecipitation , and Western Blot Analysis For analysis of various cell lines for TRAMP expression , cells were harvested and submitted twice to Triton X-114 extraction ( Bordier , 1981 ) .
The detergent phases were pooled , and proteins were precipitated by the addition of MeOH/CHCI ; ( 1:4 [ v/v ] ) .
Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein determination kit ( Pierce ) .
Membrane proteins ( 20 ug ) were diluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed for TRAMP expression by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting .
For coimmunoprecipitation experiments , 2937 cells were transfected with 5 ug of each plasmid by the calcium phosphate procedure ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) for 8 hr .
At 26 hr after transfection , cells from a 10 mm plate were lysed in 200 l of lysis buffer { 1 % NP-40 , 20 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 7.4 ] , 150 mM NaCl ) ) supplemented with 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM pefabloc-sc ( Serva ) , and 10 g/ml of each leupeptin and aprotinin ( Sigma ) .
Postnuclear lysates were precleared for at least 1 hr on Sepharose 6B ( Pharmacia ) before precipitation for 2 hr or overnight with 3 pl of anti-Flag agarose or 1 pg of anti-Myc ( E10 ) previously bound to protein G-Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) .
Precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 1 % NP-40 , boiled in sample buffer , analyzed by SDS-PAGE , and transferred to nitrocellulose ( Hybond ECL , Amersham ) .
For Western blot analysis of cell extracts and immunoprecipitates , blots were blocked with 5 % skim milk , 0.5 % Tween 20 in PBS and revealed using affinity-purified anti-T RAMP antibody AL104 at 1:2000 dilution , anti-Flag MAb at 5 g/ml , anti-FADD MAb at 1 g/ml , and anti-Myc MAb ( 9E10 ) at 5 g/ml , followed by incubation with per-oxidase-conjugated secondary antibody ( Jackson Laboratories ) .
Bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemilumines-cence kit ( Amersham ) according to the instructions of the manufac-turer .
Immunofluorescence 293T cells plated onto coverslips at a density of 2 X 10° cells in a 35 mm dish were transfected with 1 ug of full-length TRAMP con-struct .
At 20 hr after transfection , the coverslips were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS , followed by a 10 min incubation in 95 % EtOH , 5 % acetic acid .
Cells were stained with affinity-purified anti- TRAMP AL104 antibody at 25 ug/ml , followed by anti-rabbit immunoglobu-lin-FITC { Dianova , Hamburg , Federal Republic of Germany ) diluted 1:150 and examined by confocal microscopy ( Zeiss ) .
FACS Staining Cells were stained with affinity-purified anti-T RAMP AL104 antibody at a 1:20 dilution at 4°C for 20 min , washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) buffer ( PBS , 10 % FCS , 0.02 % NaN ; ) , pelleted at 200 x g , and stained with anti-rabbit-FITC ( Silenus Labo-ratory , Australia ) , diluted 1:400 for 20 min at 4°C .
Cells were washed and analyzed in the flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) .
TRAIL receptor , Fas , and TNFR expression on cell lines was analyzed by FACS using the respective Flag-tagged ligands ( 1 ug ) as detecting probes .
Bound ligands were detected with the anti-Flag M2 antibody , followed by a FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody ( Di-anova ) .
NF- « B Reporter Assay Approximately 2 x 10° 293T cells were seeded on 35 mm dishes and grown in 5 % CO , at 37°C .
Cells were transfected the next day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method .
The precipitate was removed after 8 hr , and the ICE family inhibitor zZVAD-fmk ( 50 wM ; Enzyme Systems Products ) was added .
After 24 hr , cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed with 200 wl of Triton X-100 , glycylglycine lysis buffer ( 1 % Triton X-100 , 25 mM glycylglycine [ pH 7.81 , 14 mM MgSO , 4mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT ) .
Aliquots of cell lysates { 1.5 wl ) were mixed with 100 wl of luciferase assay reagent ( Pro-mega } , and the luciferase activity was determined using a biocounter M2500 luminometer ( Inotech , Zurich ) .
B-Galactosidase activity was determined in a mixture containing 50 wl of cell extract and 50 pl of a buffer containing the substrate o-nitrophenyl -- o-galactopyra-noside ( Sigma ) .
Samples were incubated at 37°C until a yellow color developed and the absorbance was determined at 405 nm .
These values were used to normalize transfection efficiency .
Cell Death Assay 293T cells ( 2 x 10° ) were transiently transfected with either theempty vector ( 1 g ) or pcDNA3 expression construct encoding TRAMP ( 1 g ) , ( 1 pg ) , or both .
Expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis on whole-cell extracts .
The ICE family inhibitor zVAD-fmk was added , where indicated , at a concentration of 50 M 8 hr after transfection .
At 24 hr following transfection , the extent of cell death was assessed by the morphology of the cells .
Nuclear DNA degradation was determined in lysed cells using a kit from Boeh-ringer ( Number 1544 675 ) that detects cytoplasmic histone-associ-ated DNA fragments .
Ligand Binding Assay Wells of microtiter plates were coated with various receptor-Fc constructs at 1 pg/ml in PBS { 100 ul per well ) overnight at room temperature .
After blocking with PBS containing 5 % fetal calf serum { ( FCS ) for 1 hr at 37°C , wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 .
