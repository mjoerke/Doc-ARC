Lineage- and Stage-Specific Expression of Runt Box Polypeptides in Primitive and Definitive Hematopoiesis By Maria Teresa Corsetti and Franco Calabi Translocations involving the human CBFA2 locus have been associated with leukemia .
This gene , originally named AML1 , is a human homologue of the Drosophila gene runt that controls early events in fly embryogenesis .
To clarify the role of mammalian runt products in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis , we have studied their pattern of expression in mouse hematopoietic tissues in the adult and during ontogeny using an anti-runt box antiserum .
In the adult bone marrow , we found expression of runt polypeptides in differ HE runt locus of Drosophila melanogaster controls early developmental events in segmentation , sex deter-mination , and neurogenesis . ''
The first mammalian runt homologue was identified in humans as the locus , on 21q22 , involved in the t ( 8 ; 21 ) of acute myeloid leukemia .
* '' Because of this , it was initially named AML1 .
Three runt-like loci have been characterized both in humans and in mice . ''
The official nomenclature ( CBFAI-3 , in which the acronym stands for Core Binding Factor , a subunit ) reflects the recognition that runt products bind DNA with specificity for a consensus sequence ( Pu/TACCPwCA'~ '' ) , which was originally identified in viral enhancers '' and later also found in a number of cellular genes .
' '' * '' '' The DNA binding domain has been shown to coincide with an approximately 120 amino acid sequence that is conserved among all known runt family members ( runt box ) .
'* '' '' At least the CBFA !
and CBFA2 loci give rise to multiple isoforms because of alternative splicing . ''
Functional studies suggest that some of these may have opposing effects on the transcription of test target genes and on cell differentiation . ''
Thus , current evidence suggests that runt products make up a complex regulatory system that controls critical events in differentiation .
The expression of CBFA genes has been investigated both in the adult and in the fetus at the mRNA level . ''
However , only partial data are available for the hematopoietic system .
In most adult vertebrates , hematopoiesis occurs largely in the bone marrow , where a limited pool of pluripotential stem cells gives rise , through sequential commitment and differentiation steps , to mature blood cells of the different lineages : erythrocytes , granulocytes , platelets ( megakaryocytes ) , and lymphocytes . ''
This adult or definitive hematopoietic phase is preceded , in ontogeny , by others in which hematopoietic stem cell activity can be found at three other sites : the yolk sac , the aorta-genital ridge-mesonephros ( AGM ) region , and the fetal liver . ''
Significant differences are known to exist between the different phases . ''
Recently , by generating mouse lines functionally deleted in the CBFAZ locus , a requirement has been postulated for this locus in hematopoiesis starting from the fetal liver phase . ''
In contrast , the hematopoietic function of the yolk sac was apparently unimpaired in these lines .
However , no direct evidence is available regarding the expression of runt polypeptides within hematopoietic cells .
In this report , we set out to provide such evi-dence .
In particular , we aimed to address the question of whether the characteristic leukemic phenotypes associated Blood , Vol 89 , No 7 ( April 1 ) , 1997 ; pp 2359-2368 entiating myeloid cells and in B lymphocytes .
Within the erythroid lineage , runt expression is biphasic , clearly present in the erythroblasts of early blood islands and of the fetal liver , but absent in the adult .
Biochemical analysis by Western blotting of fetal and adult hematopoietic populations shows several runt isoforms .
At least one of them appears to be myeloid specific .

with translocations involving the human CBFA2Z locus correlate with a restricted expression of normal runt products to specific lineages or stages of hematopoietic differentiation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice and embryos .
TO mice were used as a source of embryos .
Gestational age , which was measured in days post coitum ( dpc ) , was calculated from midnight of the mating night .
Pregnant mice were killed by cervical dislocation .
Embryos were collected in cold phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and immediately processed .
The 7.5-day embryos were embedded without removing the decidua .
Fetal livers were dissected with the help of a dissection microscope .
Normal adult tissues were obtained from TO or CD1 mice .
Bone marrow was obtained by flushing the femoral and tibial shafts with cold PBS .
Expression of - recombinant - proteins .
| Constructs encoding AML1 , * an AML1/MTG8 in-frame fusion , '' and an AML1/MTGS8 out-of-frame fusion '' were assembled in eukaryotic expression vectors or pBABE Neo* '' from genomic and cDNA fragments and verified by sequencing ( F. Calabi , unpublished data ) .
COS-7 cells '' were transfected by the diethyl aminoethyl-dextran/chlo-roquine procedure . ''
Cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection .
A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 51 to 128 of human AML1* was joined in frame to the glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) coding sequence in the expression vector pGEX-2T ( Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
Escherichia coli TG1 cells harboring the construct were grown in SOB*/ampicillin medium to an ODss , of 0.5 before the addition of isopropyl-0-p-thiogalactoside ( IPTG ; 1 mmol/L final concentration ) .
After a further 4.5 hours , cells were harvested and lysed essentially as described . ''
A significant fraction of the recombinant GST/runt box polypeptide was found to be soluble in the detergent lysate and directly purified by binding to glutathi-one-agarose ( Sigma , Poole , Dorset , UK ) and elution with 5 mmol/L From the Developmental Biology Unit , Division of Cell and Molecular Biology , Institute of Child Health , London , UK .

2360 reduced glutathione ( GSH ) in 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer , pH 8 .
Preparation of the anti-runt box antiserum .
A New Zealand rabbit was immunized with approximately 250 ug recombinant GST/ runt box polypeptide by subcutaneous injection in complete Freund 's adjuvant .
Two further injections were administered in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant at 10-day intervals .
After 5 months of rest , the rabbit was boosted by a subcutaneous injection of approximately 10 ug purified runt box fragment .
This was prepared from the affinity-purified GST/runt box polypeptide by digestion with thrombin ( Sigma ) , followed by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) .
The antiserum obtained from the boosted rabbit was first depleted of antibodies reactive with GST and bacterial antigens by passing it through an Affi-Gel 10 column ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) coupled to total cellular proteins ( 70 OD ; s , U/mL gel ) from an IPTG-induced bacterial culture harboring the pGEX-2T vector .
Depletion was verified by Western blotting .
The anti-runt box antibodies were then further purified by affinity chromatography on an Affi-Gel 10 column coupled to affinity-purified GST/runt box polypeptide ( 4 mg/mL gel ) .
Bound antibodies were eluted first with 0.1 mol/L glycine , 10 % dioxan , pH 2.5 , followed by 0.1 mol/L diethylamine , pH 11.5.5 '' Acid- and alkali-eluted fractions were dialyzed against PBS , pH 7.2 ; pooled ; and concentrated on Centricon 30 ( Amicon , Beverly , MA ) .
Antibodies .
The following rat monoclonal antibodies ( MoAbs ) were used : 3C1 , anti-c-kit , or CD117* ( Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) ; RB6-8C5 , anti-Gr-1* ( Pharmingen ) ; M1/70 , anti-Mac-1 , or CD11b '' ( Serotec , Oxford , UK ) ; TER-119 , anti-mouse erythroid cells '' ( Pharmingen ) ; and RA3-6B2 , anti-CD45R , or B220° ( Sigma ) .
A fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse serum ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) was used to identify B cells .
Mouse bone marrow cell separation .
| The separations were performed using a VarioMacs System ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch-Glad-back , Germany ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
Briefly , cells ( up to 5 x 10*/mL , in PBS , pH 7.2 , containing 1 % bovine serum albumin , 5 mmol/L EDTA , and 0.01 % azide ) were labeled with the rat primary antibody ( TER-119 or FITC-coupled Gr-1 and CD45R , 0.5 to 1 ug/10° cells ) for 30 minutes on ice , washed once , and incubated with goat anti-rat Ig coupled to Microbeads for 20 minutes at 4°C .
The cells were then passed over an AZ column placed in a VarioMACS separator .
Purity of the sorted cells was checked using a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
In the case of TER-119 , eluted cells were stained with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-rat Ig ( Jackson , West Grove , PA ) before FACS analysis .
After a single passage through the magnetic field , Gr-1 and CD45R positively selected populations were usually found to be about 90 % pure .
However , TER-119 cells were only enriched to 50 % to 60 % because of cell clumping occurring on the column and causing nonspecific trapping .
Therefore , in most cases , the enriched TER-119 population was dispersed by pipetting as carefully as possible and reapplied to the column .
The final purity was 60 % to 75 % .
Immunohistochemistry .
- Cytospin preparations were fixed for 5 minutes in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , pH 7.2 ; washed for 2 minutes in PBS/0.5 % Triton X-100 ; and incubated in PBS/10 % goat serum/0.1 % azide ( blocking solution ) .
They were then sequentially incubated with ( 1 ) anti-runt box antiserum ( ~10 pg/mL . )
in blocking solution for 1 hour to overnight at room temperature , ( 2 ) biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antiserum ( Vector , Burlingame , CA ) for at least 1 hour , and ( 3 ) FITC-conjugated goat anti-biotin antiserum ( Vector ) or with R-Phycoerythrin-ExtraAvidin ( Sigma ) .
Double immunolabeling on single-cell suspensions was performed as follows .
After 5 minutes of preincubation on ice in blocking solution containing 0.02 % azide , the anti-cell surface antigen rat CORSETT !
AND CALABI MoAb was added ( 2 ug/10° cells ) and incubated for 20 minutes .
Cells were washed twice , resuspended in blocking solution , and cytospun .
The slides were processed as above , adding an FITC-conjugated mouse anti-rat serum ( Jackson ) to samples treated with unlabeled TER-119 .
For competition experiments , the purified anti-runt box antiserum was preincubated for at least 2 hours at 4°C with extracts from bacteria expressing either the GST/runt box or the GST proteins .
The amount of GST/runt box extract required for complete inhibition of the anti-runt box antiserum at the working dilution was determined empirically by titration .
Approximately 50 4L of antiserum , ie , the amount generally used per one slide , could usually be completely inhibited by the extract from 1 mL .
of bacterial culture .
In every experiment , parallel samples were stained with rabbit preimmune serum as a negative control .
Slides were mounted in an antifade medium ( Vector ) and examined using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) .
Images were captured by a Photometrics CCD camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) coupled to a Macintosh Quadra computer ( Apple Computers , Cupertino , CA ) .
Image analysis was performed using Smartcapture Software ( Digital Scientific , Cam-bridge , UK ) .
Paraffin sections were prepared for staining according to published procedures* with minor modifications .
Briefly , whole embryos and dissected organs were frozen by immersion in iso-pentane precooled to freezing point , transferred to precooled ethanol ( -70°C ) , and left for 3 days .
After this , cold ethanol was replaced every 2 days ( usually 3 times ) to complete dehydration .
Specimens were subsequently equilibrated to room temperature and embedded in paraffin wax .
Microtome sections ( 8-pm thick ) were dewaxed in xylene ( 3 changes of 2 minutes each ) , rehydrated in graded ethanol baths , incubated in blocking solution , and processed as described above , except that the fluorescent reagent was substituted with preformed streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex ( Dako ) .
Bound peroxidase was detected using di-amino-benzidine ( DAB ) /NiC ] ; as sub-strate .
Western blotting .
- Cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer '' and sonicated to shear DNA ; aliquots ( 10 ' cells ) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 9 % to 18 % gradient gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter ( Schleicher and Schiiell , Dassel , Germany ) .
The filter was blocked with 2.5 % nonfat , dry milk powder in PBS before incubation for 3 hours with purified anti-runt box antiserum diluted in PBS containing 2 % bovine serum albumin .
After washing in PBS/ 0.5 % Tween 20 , the blot was developed with 1 4Ci/10 mL ' '' L-protein A ( > 30 mCi/mg ; Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) in PBS/0.5 % Tween 20 .
RESULTS Production of an antiserum against runt box polypeptides .
A polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 51 to 128 in the predicted AML1 sequence* ( ie , the first 78 amino acids of the runt box ) was expressed in E coli as a fusion to GST .
After affinity purification on glutathione-agarose , it was used to immunize a rabbit .
Initial testing of the raw antiserum showed reactivity against cellular components that was not blocked by the GST/runt box polypeptide .
The antiserum was then affinity purified as described in Materials and Methods to yield an operationally specific reagent , as tested on Western blots of expressing bacterial lysates ( data not shown ) .
As a further stringent specificity criterion , in most of our immunostaining experiments we have made use , as a negative control , of purified antiserum blocked by preincuba- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

tion with a bacterial lysate expressing the GST/runt box polypeptide .
This was compared with the signal given by the same antiserum preincubated with a bacterial lysate expressing a comparable amount of GST alone .
We are therefore highly confident of the specificity of the staining observed for runt polypeptides .
The reactivity of the anti-runt box antiserum was verified by Western blotting analysis of a panel of COS-7 cells expressing three different runt box-containing polypeptides ( Fig 1 ) : a 30-kD polypeptide corresponding to AML1* and encoded by the pBEH-RMS plasmid ; an 84-kD polypeptide corresponding to an in-frame AML1/MTG8 fusion '' and encoded by the pBEH-RM plasmid ; and a 19.5-kD polypeptide corresponding to an out-of-frame AML1/MTG $ 8 fusion '' and encoded by the pBN-TG2 plasmid .

In our analysis of the expression of runt box polypeptides in hematopoietic cells , we focused on the mouse to be able to study more easily both the adult and the embryonic/fetal stages .
First of all , expression in adult bone marrow was investigated on cytospin preparations .
Most cells were found positive for runt ( Fig 2 ) , ranging from large blasts to maturing granulocytes .
A clear positive signal was detected in the nucleus .
It was somewhat stronger and more homogenous in the larger , more immature cells .
To determine the lineage of runt-expressing cells , we performed double staining with lineage-specific markers .
Gr-1 and Mac-1 were used for myelomonocytic elements , the former being specific for the granulocytic lineage , whereas the latter is shared by granulocytes and monocytes ; TER-119 for erythroid cells ; and Ig for B cells .
Essentially all Gr-1* cells express runt ( Fig 3A ) .

AND CALABI anti-rbox + GST a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum and counter-stained with Mayer hemalum , we observed that the smaller cells with the doughnut-shaped nucleus characteristic of mature granulocytes appear to be less positive than the larger , more immature cells ( data not shown ) .
Erythroid cells , which were identified by the TER-119 antibody , do not show a clear reactivity ; some dubious spots can be detected in only about 30 % to 50 % of the cells ( Fig 3C ) .
B-lineage cells ( Ig * ) are uniformly positive ( Fig 3B ) .
The c-kit receptor is helpful in defining an earlier differentiation stage than lineage markers , because approximately 50 % of the positive cells are negative for lineage markers .
About 70 % of the c-kit-bearing cells are runt-positive ( data not shown ) , suggesting that runt expression is also found in some precursor cells , ie , before terminal differentiation .
Because monocytes represent only a minor fraction of bone marrow cells ( ~2 % ) , expression of runt in the mono-cytic lineage was investigated on a nearly pure population of residential peritoneal macrophages ( data not shown ) and found to overlap completely with that of Mac-1 ( correspond-ing to 70 % of the cells ) .
The megakaryocytic lineage was not studied in detail .
However , the large hyperdiploid megakaryocytes , which are easily recognizable in the bone marrow , are runt-negative ( data not shown ) .
Expression of runt box polypeptides in embryonic hematopoiesis .
- We next moved to analyze runt expression in early hematopoiesis .
The first time point examined was at 7.5 dpc .
At this time , blood islands begin to form in the mesoderm of the yolk sac and erythroblasts can be seen . '' ''
Specific nuclear staining was observed with the anti-runt box antiserum in most of the cells within these structures ( Fig 4A and B ) .

( C and D ) Staining with anti-runt box antiserum preincubated with a bacterial extract containing either GST ( anti-rbox + GST ; C ) or GST/runt ( anti-rbox + GST/runt ; D ) .
The staining is abolished only in the latter sample .
At 11.5 dpc , the yolk sac is near the end of its erythropoi-etic function , although it is still the source of all circulating erythrocytes .
In contrast , the liver is the expanding hematopoietic organ and is constituted by immature , fast growing cells .
These cells are almost exclusively erythroid , '' although for the most part lacking the erythroid-specific marker TER-119 , whereas they are strongly positive for c-kit . '' ''
On wax sections , the anti-runt box antiserum stained about half of these cells ( Fig 4C and D ) with variable intensity .
Cytospin preparations were also made from the liver of 12.5-dpc mice to study in greater detail the nature of the positive cells and the localization of the runt box polypeptides .
Both early erythroblasts and nucleated primitive erythrocytes could be identified ( Fig 5A through D ) .
The former , which are easily recognizable by their nuclear shape and high nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio , showed a diffuse nuclear staining .
However , in the latter cells , which are characterized by their round nuclei and lower nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio , staining was visible only at the nucleus/cytoplasmic border ( Fig 5A , arrow-heads ) .
An identical staining pattern can be observed in the nucleated primitive erythrocytes that make up the majority of circulating blood cells at this stage ( Fig 5E ) .
It is unlikely that this pattern is due to a fixation or staining artefact , because it was apparent even with a different fixative ( ie , cold acetone for 10 minutes ) and with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit reagent ( data not shown ) .
At 16.5 days , the liver contains erythroid cells of all differentiation stages , displaying almost all the characteristics of the adult bone marrow erythroid cells .
However , populations differentiating toward the other lineages can be shown by both morphologic analysis and staining with lineage-specific antibodies .
Overall , more than one third of the cells express nuclear runt box polypeptides ( Fig 6A ) .

AND CALABI anti-rbox + GST 12.5 BLOOD anti-rbox + GST/runt anti-rbox + GST strongly stained for runt .
About 30 % of the TER-119* cells were stained by the anti-runt box antiserum , showing that runt expression is maintained in some erythroid cells at this stage .
The proportion of runt-expressing cells within the c-kit* population was lower in 16.5-dpc fetal liver ( 40 % ; data not shown ) than in adult bone marrow ( 70 % ; see above ) .
This correlates with a higher proportion of immature precursors within the c-kit ' pool of the former tissue '' and suggests that runt is expressed by the more mature c-kit* cells .
Of the Mac-1 * cells ( 6 % of the total ) , approximately 60 % expressed runt ( data not shown ) .
Because Gr-1* granulocytes make up a similar proportion of the Mac-1* population and they are all runt-positive , it is likely that the Mac-1*/ runt cells are Gr-1~ , ie , they must be monocytes .

Competition experiments were performed on 12.5-dpc liver ( C and D ) and blood ( E and F ) as for bone marrow ( Fig 2 ) .
In both tissues , the staining persisted after preincubation with GST ( C and E ) , but was abolished after preincubation with GST/runt ( D and F ) .
showed a number of runt box polypeptides ( Fig 7A ) .
The most abundant component migrated as a doublet at an apparent molecular weight of 53/55 kD , and minor ones at 43/45 , 40/41 , and 34 kD .
We therefore designate the runt products as p53/55-runt , p43/45-runt , p40/41-runt , and p34-runt .
Bands at 37 and 30 kD were recognized by the preimmune serum ( Fig 7A , asterisks ) and were not competed by the recombinant GST/runt box polypeptide ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , they must be regarded as nonspecific .
In some , but not all experiments , we could also detect an additional specific band at approximately 27 kD .
This was only found in some TO mice and never in CD1 , and may suggest a certain variability in the pattern of runt expression .
In gen-eral , the relative abundance of the various species appeared to vary to a certain extent between different experiments ( compare the bone marrow lanes in Fig 7A and C ) .

RUNT BOX POLYPEPTIDES IN HEMATOPOIESIS tides shown on Western blotting analysis was due to partial proteolysis , in some experiments transfected COS-7 cells expressing the AML1a polypeptide were mixed with bone marrow cells before lysis and electrophoresis .
No decrease in the amount or size of the COS cell-derived AML1a polypeptide was detected in comparison with unmixed samples ( data not shown ) .
To investigate whether there is lineage-restricted expression of individual runt products , Western blotting was also performed on purified bone marrow subpopulations expressing CD4SR , Gr-1 , or TER-119 markers .
B lymphocytes and granulocytes account for most , if not all , of the runt-box polypeptides in the whole bone marrow ( Fig 7A ) .
All of the described runt products appear to be expressed in both cell types , with the exception of p34-runt , which is significantly enriched in the myeloid cells , while totally absent in B lymphocytes .
Furthermore , the Gr-1* population shows a higher average content of p53/55-runt than do total marrow or B cells , and only the smaller component of the p40/41-runt doublet is visible .
In Fig 7A , other slower migrating species seem also to be enriched in either myeloid or B cells .
However , these results were not reproducible .
Consistent with the immunohisto-chemistry data , no specific runt signal can be seen in the adult TER-119* ( erythroid ) population .
Western blotting analysis was also performed on fetal liver cell lysates from 12.5- and 16.5-dpc embryos ( Fig 7B ) .
The pattern is essentially similar to that of whole adult bone marrow .
However , the intensity of the bands decreases with developmental age .
The presence of runt box polypeptides in erythroid ( TER-119* ) populations from 16.5 fetal liver , but not from adult bone marrow , is unlikely to be due solely to a different cellular complexity .
Morphologic analysis by May-Griinwald-Giemsa staining showed that the samples had a similar composition in differentiated elements , whereas the difference in the relative content of nucleated cells ( 56 % in the 16.5-day fetal liver sample against 22 % in the adult bone marrow sample ) was less than 3 times .
We also investigated the runt box polypeptides expressed at other adult hematopoietic sites , ie , thymus , spleen , and peritoneal macrophages ( Fig 7C ) .
All of the examined samples express p53/55-runt , p43/45-runt , and p40/41-runt , although their relative abundance varies .
For example , p40/41-runt is the prevalent species in peritoneal macro-phages , although it could not be clearly detected in the thy-mus .
p34-runt was not observed in any of these tissues .
DISCUSSION The involvement of a human runt homologue ( CBFAZ , at 21q22 ) in a number of leukemia-associated chromosome translocations '' suggests that it plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis .
Consistent with this finding , runt products have been shown to be able to regulate genes whose expression is characteristic of differentiated blood cells , '' '' to modulate the ability of hematopoietic cell lines to differentiate in vitro , '' '' and to be required for normal fetal liver hematopoie-sis . ''
However , a satisfactory definition of the role of mammalian runt genes in hematopoiesis requires a detailed analy- 2365 sis of their pattern of expression within the different lineages and at different stages .
This is of particular interest in view of the distinctive leukemic phenotypes associated with different CBFA2 rearrangements .
Furthermore , although a number of runt isoforms have been predicted on the basis of cDNA cloning , their direct biochemical analysis has so far lagged behind .
We have approached these issues by developing an antiserum specific for runt polypeptides .
This antiserum was raised against the NH , -terminal half of the human runt box encoded by the CBFAZ locus .
However , given the degree of both inter-species and inter-isotype sequence conservation , it must be expected to recognize all the known runt box-containing polypeptides .
The antiserum has been used first , in conjunction with hematopoietic lineage/stage markers , for an analysis of expression at the single-cell level and , second , for biochemical characterization .
At the cellular level in adult mouse bone marrow , runt polypeptides are found in differentiating granulocytic and B-lymphoid cells .
They are also found in other hematopoietic lineages outside the bone marrow ( ie , thymocytes and peritoneal macrophages ) .
Thus , even within the hematopoietic system , runt expression does not coincide with commitment to a single lineage .
Typical , mature granulocytes in mouse bone marrow have been reported to be negative for chfa2 mRNA by in situ hybridization . ''
The discrepancy with our results may be due to the different sensitivity of the techniques used .
We have found the smaller , doughnut-shaped cells to give the weakest runt signals .
Alternatively , runt polypeptides may persist in late myelocytes well after their synthesis has ceased , reflecting a slow turnover , as reported for other myeloid pro-teins . ''
Within the erythroid lineage , runt expression undergoes two phases during ontogenesis .
Whereas runt products are essentially undetectable in the adult , they are clearly expressed in the embryo .
This is true not only of the yolk sac stage , but also at least of the beginning of the liver phase ( 11.5 dpc ) .
However , by late fetal life ( 16.5 dpc ) the frequency of runt-positive erythroid precursors in the liver de-creases .
This decrease may correlate with the different ori-gin , during ontogenesis , of fetal liver erythroid precursors .
It is currently generally accepted that sequential waves of hematopoietic activity are contributed to the fetal liver by extra-embryonic ( ie , the yolk sac ) and intra-embryonic ( the AGM region ) sources . '' ''
The decrease in runt expression may parallel the decline in erythropoieitic activity of yolk sac progenitors , which are replaced by intra-embryonic progeni-tors .
Recent experiments have shown that , whereas liver hematopoiesis appears to require a functional CBFAZ locus , yolk sac erythropoiesis would not . '' ''
In the light of our experimental evidence on the expression of runt polypeptides in the yolk sac , these data suggest two hypotheses .
First , because our anti-runt box antiserum would cross-react with CBFAl and CBFA3 products , it is possible that either or both latter loci , rather than CBFA2 , are expressed in the yolk sac .
Second , although normally expressed and presumably required in yolk sac hematopoiesis , CBFAZ products may From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

be functionally replaced , within this system , by other gene products .
Analogous examples of plasticity and functional redundancy have been described in several other developmental pathways .
A number of genes have been shown to be required for yolk sac hematopoiesis , eg , GATA-I , tall , rbtn2 , and GATA-2 .
`` * It will be interesting to investigate the relationships , if any , between these genes and runt .
Although runt polypeptides are clearly expressed in maturing granulocytes , B lymphocytes , and monocytes , their presence at earlier differentiation stages remains to be investi-gated .
Our data on c-kit '' cells suggest that they are expressed before overt lineage differentiation .
Furthermore , we have preliminary evidence that human CD34* cells are runt-positive ( M.T.C. , unpublished data ) .
At the biochemical level , our analysis shows that a number of runt box polypeptides are present in both primitive and definitive hematopoietic cells .
We have not established the precise identity of the various species observed .
However , they can be correlated with the isoforms predicted from cDNA sequences by comparison of the observed with the expected molecular weights .
Thus , the p53/55-runt that is the major component in both total bone marrow and purified granulocytic and lymphoid subpopulations may correspond to a CBFA1l and/or to a CBFAZ isoform ( ie , the A1 '' or the B1° isoform , respectively ) .
A slightly higher molecular weight has been reported for the former expressed in COS cells . ''
p40/41 runt may correspond to the CBFAZ B2 iso-form© and p34 runt may correspond to the CBFA1 AZ iso-form . ''
As for the p43/45 runt , it may correspond to the product of the CBFA3 locus , based on the sequence of a human cDNA . ''
The three largest species appear as doublets , ie , two closely spaced bands of roughly similar abundance .
This finding suggests that they share a similar type of modification ( eg , phosphorylation ) .
The variable ratio between individual species may indicate that their relative balance is dynamic and possibly correlated with different functional states .
Clearly , at least some of the complexity of runt box polypeptides in the bone marrow may be due to cellular heteroge-neity .
However , with one notable exception ( the p34 runt , which is specific to granulocytes ) , a largely similar pattern was observed in more homogenous subpopulations of individual lineages , ie , relatively mature granulocytes , B lymphocytes , thymocytes , and embryonic erythroid precursors .
It can be concluded that the components of this pattern ( ie , p53/55 runt , p43/45 runt , and p40/41 runt ) are not sufficient per se to induce lineage commitment in hematopoietic precursors .
It remains possible that they play a role in this process or that they are involved in postcommitment events shared by the different lineages .
Finally , the data presented here bear on the relationship between rearrangements at the human CBFAZ locus and leukemia .
Both myeloid and lymphoid leukemia have been associated with translocations involving this locus , '' * although the two types correlate with different breakpoint positions .
The phenotypes of the leukemic populations resemble either of the main cellular types expressing runt polypeptides in normal bone marrow .
Thus , the immunopheno-type of t ( 12 ; 21 ) leukemias ( HLA-DR* , CD10* , and CD19* ) indicates a B-cell origin and correlates with runt expression in normal marrow B cells .
The phenotype of t ( 8 ; 21 ) AML , which is characterized by a certain degree of maturation within the leukemic clone , correlates with CBFA expression in differentiating myelocytes .
This finding suggests that leukemic transformation has a requirement for the same conditions that allow normal CBFA expression or action , rather than being due to inappropriate lineage or stage expression .
It may be expected that other lineages expressing From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

RUNT BOX POLYPEPTIDES IN HEMATOPOIESIS runt polypeptides are susceptible to leukemic transformation upon mutation at one of the CBFA loci .
Alternatively , it is possible that the novel translocated product ( s ) encoded by a rearranged CBFA2 locus competes or synergizes selectively with a lineage- or stage-specific runt isoform .
A prime candidate in the myeloid lineage would be the p34-runt .
