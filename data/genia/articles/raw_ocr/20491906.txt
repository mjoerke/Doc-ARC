Mohammad Ishaq , '' Ming Fan , and Ven Natarajan We have previously reported that the activation of resting human immature peripheral blood T ( PBT ) lymphocytes is associated with the loss of retinoid X receptor a ( RXRa ) expression .
In the present study , we have demonstrated that , unlike resting cells , activation of cycling human mature PBT lymphocytes , and T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines is accompanied by the accumulation of RXRa mRNA and protein .
Interestingly , cyclosporin A further augmented RXRa expression , indicating the involvement of calcineurin pathways in the process .
9-cis retinoic acid inhibited the accumulation , suggesting that retinoids can regulate the synthesis of their own receptors during T cell activation .
Transfection analysis in Jurkat cells , using RXRE-dependent reporter assays , showed that RXRa accumulated during T cell activation was transcriptionally inactive .
To investigate the mechanism of such inhibition , the role of two mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways , c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , in modulating RXRE-dependent transcription , was explored .
The expression of constitutively active MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 ( MEKK1 ) inhibited RXRE-dependent transcription , whereas dominant negative MEKK1 increased the transcription , indicating the involvement of JNK signaling pathways in the process .
In contrast , expression of constitutively active MEK1 , which activates ERK pathway , enhanced RXRE-dependent activation .
When both were activated simultaneously , JNK pathway was dominant over ERK pathway and resulted in inhibition of RXRE-mediated transcription .
These data demonstrate a dual regulatory control of RXRa expression during the activation of resting and cycling T lymphocytes and indicate a dynamic balance between JNK and ERK pathways in modulating RXRE-mediated transactivation .
The Journal of Immunology , 2000 , 165 ; 4217-4225. ation , retinoids also influence growth , development , and ap- optosis .
These effects are mediated through retinoid X receptors ( RXRa , RXR , RXRy ) '' and retinoic acid receptors ( RARa , RAR , RARy ) , a group of nuclear receptors involved in retinoic acid-mediated gene activation ( 1-6 ) .
These receptors exert their action as transcriptional regulators by binding , as homodimers or heterodimers , to specific hormone response elements , RXRE and RARE , in the promoters of target genes .
The role of retinoid receptors in the physiology of T lymphocytes is not well understood .

T cell activation triggers multiple signaling pathways including the activation of mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases ( 15-18 ) .
These include extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) /stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) , and p38 .
ERK is activated by upstream kinase MAP/ERK kinase ( MEK ) , whereas JNK and p38 are activated by JNK kinase ( JNKK/SEK/MKK4 ) .
MEK and MKK4 are activated by Raf-1 and MEK kinase ( MEKK ) , respectively ( 19-22 ) .
MEKK1 has been shown to bind JNK and preferentially activate JNK pathway ( 23 , 24 ) .
The role of MAP kinase pathways in the regulation of retinoid receptor signaling during T cell activation is not known .
Two different signaling events occur during the in vitro stimulation of resting immature and actively cycling mature T cells .
Although both types of cells produce IL-2 following activation , only the resting immature T cells undergo cell division and proliferate .
In contrast , activation of cycling mature T cells by Abs to TCR or PMA plus PHA or ionomycin ( ION ) is known to suppress their growth and lead to activation-induced cell death ( AICD ; Refs .
25-28 ) .
We have previously shown that RXRa levels in resting human peripheral blood T ( PBT ) lymphocytes are reduced during transition from G , /G , to S phase of the cell cycle and remain low throughout T cell proliferation ( 29 ) .
Surprisingly , during the course of our investigation , we found that RXRa mRNA levels were significantly induced when cycling PBT cells were restimu-lated with OKT3 , PMA plus PHA , or ION or OKT3 .
This was in contrast to resting PBMCs , which lost RXRa expression after activation .
In the present work , we set out to investigate the regulation of RXRa expression in actively dividing and cycling normal PBT cells and also T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines ( Jurkat and SupT13 ) , after in vitro activation by OKT3 , PMA plus PHA , or 0022-1767/00/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 4218 REGULATION OF RXRa EXPRESSION DURING T CELL ACTIVATION ION or OKT3 .
We found that the levels of RXRa expression were significantly increased in these cells after these treatments .
The accumulated RXRa was found to be transcriptionally inactive , and the activation resulted in the silencing of RXRE-mediated gene transcription .
We provide evidence that the activation of JNK and not the ERK pathway inhibits the RXRE-mediated gene transcription .
Interestingly , the activation of ERK pathway was found to increase the RXRE-mediated gene transcription .
We also found that when both were activated simultaneously , JNK pathway was dominant over ERK pathway and resulted in inhibition of RXRE-mediated gene activation .
These data demonstrate a dual regulatory control of RXRa expression during the activation of resting and cycling T lymphocytes and indicate a dynamic balance between JNK and ERK pathways in modulating RXRE-mediated transactivation .

The membrane was blocked with Blocker Blotto ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:1000 diluted RXRa ( D20 ) Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotech-nology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
RXRa was detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system from Amersham ( Arlington Heights , IL ) .
The blots were also stripped and reprobed with Abs to cyclin B1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) to confirm the equal loading of proteins in each lane .
The levels of cyclin B1 were only moderately effected by various treatments , except treatments involving Act D , where there was nearly complete loss of cyclin B1 protein .
However , equal loading was also confirmed in samples treated with Act D by staining the gel with a protein stain .
EMSA The DNA binding activity of RXRs was studied by EMSA using oligonu-cleotides corresponding to cellular retinol binding protein type II ( CRBPII ) RXRE , AGCTTCAGGTCAGAGGTCAGAGAGCT .

Up-regulation of RXRa in activated cycling T cells .
A , Total RNA isolated from Jurkat cells treated as indicated for 24 h , was subjected to RNase protection analysis using RXRa- and IL-2-specific probes as described in Materials and Methods .
GAPDH and L32 were used as internal controls for normalizing the RNA concentrations .
For clarity , a shorter x-ray exposure time is shown for GAPDH and L32 at the bottom of the figure .
B , Jurkat , SupT13 , and PBT cells were treated as indicated for 24 h ( except OKT3 treatment of Jurkat and PBT , which was done for 48 h ) , and RXRa mRNA was quantitated by RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods .
The values represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with SE calculated for each value .

4219 Jurkat with PMA + PHA for 24 h. As expected , IL-2 mRNA showed an ~50-fold induction during PMA + PHA treatment .
There was also a marked up-regulation of RXRa mRNA .
Time kinetics indicated that the accumulation of RXRa mRNA levels began as early as 4 h after the dual treatment and reached its peak within 24 h ( data not shown ) .
All three cell types showed an accumulation of RXRa mRNA ( 7- to 25-fold ) after treatment with PMA + PHA , PMA + OKT3 , or PMA + ION for 24 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
OKT3 cross-linking of SupT13 cells for 24 h resulted in a 6- to 10-fold up-regulation of RXRa mRNA .
OKT3 cross-linking of Jurkat and PBT induced a 4- to 6-fold RXRa mRNA up-regulation within 48 h. In addition to RXRa « , all cell types expressed RXRB , RARa , and RARy mRNA , whereas RXR y and RARf mRNA were undetectable ( data not shown ) .
There was also a moderate increase ( 2- to 3-fold ) in the levels of RARa mRNA observed during dual treatments of Jurkat but not with SupT13 or PBT cells ( data not shown ) .
The levels of RXR $ and RARy mRNA did not change during any of these treatments ( data not shown ) .
Western blots of the nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat , PBT ( Fig .
24 ) , and SupT13 ( Fig .
2B ) cells showed that there was a significant accumulation of RXRa protein during activation of all these cells .
These data demonstrate that the activation of cycling and actively dividing PBT cells and T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines results in a significant induction of RXRa mRNA and protein expression , unlike activation of resting PBMCs , which results in the loss of RXRa expression as reported earlier ( 29 ) .

Although the expected inhibition of IL2 mRNA synthesis by CsA was observed , this was not accompanied by the inhibition of RXRa expression ( Fig .
1A ) .
Instead , there was a 2- to 3-fold further enhancement of RXRa mRNA induction ( Fig .
1 ) and protein expression ( Fig .
2 ) in Jurkat and SupT13 cells when activation was conducted in the presence of CsA .
Activation in the presence of CsA did not further increase the RXRa mRNA and protein levels in PBT cells .
Fur-thermore , in the absence of activation signals , CsA did not have any effect on the levels of RXRa mRNA and protein in any of the cell types .
These data suggest that two divergent pathways are involved in the activation-induced IL-2 synthesis and activation-associated accumulation of RXRa .
Further , the effect of CsA on the expression of RXRa indicates the involvement of calcineurin ( CN ) signaling pathways in the regulation of RXRa expression during T cell activation .
Similar results were obtained ( data not shown ) with ascomycin ( an FK506 analogue and inhibitor of CN ) , further supporting the role of CN signaling in the regulation of RXRa expression during T cell activation .
9-CRA prevents activation-induced RXRa mRNA and protein up-regulation 9-CRA prevented the activation-induced up-regulation of RXRa mRNA ( Fig .
1 ) and protein ( Fig .
2 ) in all the three cell types by about 75 % .
In the absence of activation signals , 9-CRA did not have any effect on the levels of RXRa mRNA and protein in any of the cell types .
9-CRA was also found to abrogate the effect of CsA-induced further up-regulation of RXRa mRNA and protein during activation in Jurkat and SupT13 ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
9-CRA-mediated inhibition of RXRa up-regulation is suggestive of the ability of retinoids to modulate the synthesis of their own receptor during T cell activation .
Interestingly , the levels of IL-2 mRNA were also nearly completely down-regulated when the activation was performed in the presence of 9-CRA ( Fig .
14 ) .
Transcriptional regulation of RXRa mRNA expression during activation of cycling T cells To define the transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms involved in the regulation of RXRa mRNA levels during T cell activation in Jurkat cells , we measured the transcription of RXRa mRNA 8 h after treatment with PMA and PHA , using the nuclear run-on transcription assay ( Fig .

The membranes were washed and the transcriptional activity was quantitated using a bio-imaging analyzer ( Bas 1000 ; Fuji ) .
This experiment is a representative of three independent experiments .
ment .
PMA + PHA treatment in the presence of CsA increased the RXR mRNA transcription further by 2- to 3-fold , compared with PMA + PHA treatment alone .
When transcription was conducted with nuclei from cells undergoing activation in the presence of 9-CRA , the levels of RXR mRNA transcription decreased by about 50 % .
I-CRA also abrogated the effect of CsA-induced up-regulation of RXRa mRNA transcription by nearly 50 % .
The transcriptional regulation of RXRa expression during T cell activation was further investigated using transcriptional inhibitor Act D. There was up to 90 % inhibition of RXRa mRNA expression ( Fig .
1B ) and a corresponding decrease in protein levels ( Fig .
2 ) when the activation was conducted in the presence of this inhibitor .
Together , these data indicate that transcriptional regulation constitutes the major control of RXRa mRNA expression during the activation of cycling T cells .
Up-regulation of RXRa during T cell activation is associated with an increase in the RXRE binding activity To determine whether the accumulation of RXRa during T cell activation is associated with an increase in the DNA binding activity of this protein , we tested the nuclear extracts from PBT cells treated with PMA + PHA , either in the presence or absence of CsA or 9-CRA , for RXRE binding activity using EMSA .
The extracts from the PMA + PHA and PMA + PHA + CsA-treated cells exhibited a significant increase in the DNA binding activity when compared with nuclear extracts from the untreated cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , the nuclear extracts from cells treated with PMA + PHA in the presence of 9-CRA did not show any significant change in the DNA binding activity , which correlated with the 9-CRA-induced inhibition of RXRa up-regulation during T cell activation .
These results demonstrate that the activation-induced accumulation of RXRa protein is reflected in a corresponding increase in the DNA binding activity of this protein .

Jurkat cells were transfected with TATA-DR1-Luc or TATA-DR1-M-Luc plasmid for 24-36 h and then treated for 8 h with PMA + PHA either in the presence or absence of 9-CRA or CsA .
As seen in Fig .
5A , there was about 75 % inhibition of the RXRE-dependant luciferase activity when transfected Jurkat cells were treated with PMA + PHA .
CsA had no effect on the PMA + PHA-induced loss of RXRE activity .
We also investigated the effect of activation signals on the transcriptional activity of RXRa overexpressed by transfecting Jurkat cells with an RXRa-express-ing plasmid , pCMVX-hRXRa , along with TATA-DR1-Lue for 24 h and then treated the cells with PMA + PHA for 8 h in the presence or absence of 9-CRA or CsA .
As expected , pCMVX-hRXRa-transfected cells showed a significant increase in RXRE activity ( Fig .
54 ) .
Fig .
5B shows that this activity correlated with the significant levels of RXRa protein present in these cells .
When the transfected cells were treated with PMA + PHA in the presence or absence of 9-CRA or CsA , RXRE activity was inhibited in a manner similar to the effect on the constitutive RXRE activity ( Fig .
54 ) , even though significantly higher levels of RXRa protein were present in PMA + PHA-treated cells ( Fig .

A , Jurkat cells were transfected with TATA-DR1-Luc or TATA-DR1-M-Luc or TATA-DR1-Luc + pCMX-hRXRa or NFAT-Luc for 24 h and then treated for 8 h with PMA + PHA either in the presence or absence of 9-CRA or CsA .
In some experiments , 24-h transfected cells were also treated with 10ug/ml OKT3 , either in the presence or absence of 9-CRA , for 16 h. Cells were harvested and Luciferase activity measured as described in Materials and Methods .
The values represent the mean of three independent experiments with SE calculated for each value .
B , Nuclear extracts were prepared from TATA-DR1-Luc and TATA-DR1-Lue + pCMX-hRXRa cotransfected cells after 8 h of indicated treatments and analyzed for RXRa protein by Western blotting as described in Materials and Methods .
The values of luciferase activity corresponding to each treatment are expressed in folds ; the constitutive DR1 luciferase activity was given a value of 1 .
4221 with TATA-DR-1-M-Luc plasmid did not result in any significant luciferase activity , and PMA + PHA , either in the presence or the absence of CsA or 9-CRA , did not have any effect on this activity .
Induction of NFAT , a transcription factor that is accumulated during activation of T cells and inhibited by CsA ( 31 , 32 ) , was studied in parallel as an activation control ( Fig .
54 ) .
There was about 140-fold increase in the NFAT-driven luciferase activity after NFAT-Luc transfected Jurkat cells were treated with PMA + PHA .
As expected , when the activation was performed in the presence of CsA , there was complete loss of NFAT promoter activity .
There was a 50 % down-regulation of NFAT-driven luciferase activity when PMA + PHA treatment was done in the presence of 9-CRA .
JNK pathway inhibits and ERK pathway stimulates RXRE-mediated transcription Because T cell activation is known to trigger the activation of MAP kinases , which include JNK and ERK cascades , we explored the possibility of the role of these kinases in the regulation of RXRE-driven transcription during T cell activation .
Treatment of Jurkat cells with PMA + PHA activates both JNK and ERK pathways ( Fig .
64 ) .
These pathways are also activated by expressing constitutively active MEKK1 ( Fig .
64 ) .
In contrast , expression of dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 inhibits the JNK activity ( Fig .
6A ) .
When Jurkat cells were transfected with constitutively active MEKK1 plasmid , either in the presence or absence of pCMVX-hRXRa « , there was a dose-dependent inhibition of both ligand dependent ( data not shown ) and independent RXRE-driven transcription ( Fig .
6B ) .
Under similar experimental conditions , there was a marked stimulation of AP-1-driven luciferase activity ( Fig .
6C ) when cells were transfected with MEKK1 and AP1-Luc reporter plasmids as a control .
In contrast , expression of a dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 , either in the presence or absence of pCMVX-hRXRa , increased the RXRE-driven transcription in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
6B ) .
These data indicate that JNK pathway is involved in the inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription during T cell activation .
To rule out the contribution of ERK activation in the MEKK1-induced inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription , MEKK1 transfection was also conducted in the presence of MEK inhibitor PD98059 .
Unexpectedly , there was an additive effect on the inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription ( Fig .
6B ) by MEKK1 in the presence of the MEK inhibitor .
In addition , there was modest inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription in the presence of PD98059 without MEKKI1 .
These results indicate that , unlike JNK pathway , ERK pathway positively regulates the RXRE-driven transcription .
This observation was further confirmed by transfecting Jurkat cells with constitutively active MEK 1 plasmid , which activates ERK pathway ( Fig .
64 ) .
Fig .
6D shows that there was a dose-dependent increase in the RXRE-driven transcription with constitutively active MEK 1 plasmid .
Together , these data indicate that the activation of RXRE-driven transcription in T cells is under the dual control of JNK and ERK pathways and they exert opposite effects on the RXRE-dependent gene transcription .
JNK pathway is dominant over ERK pathway in modulating RXRE-driven transcription during T cell activation Given that treatment of T cells with PMA + PHA activates both ERK and JNK pathways and our observation that activation leads to the inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription , it can be speculated that , when both pathways are activated in T cells , JNK pathway is 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 4222 FIGURE 6 .

JNK and ERK assays were performed , as described in Materials and Methods , with extracts from PMA + PHA-treated Jurkat cells and extracts from cells transfected with indicated plasmids ( A ) .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 ug of TATA- DR1-Luc ( B and D ) or AP-1-Luc ( C ) plasmids either in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of constitutively active MEKK1 ( MEKK1DA ) or dominant negative MEKK1 ( MEKK1DN ) ( B ) or constitutively active MEK1 ( MEK1DA ) plasmid ( D ) or empty vector .

To test this , Jurkat cells were transfected with TATA-DR1-Luc reporter vector and constitutively active MEKK1 plasmid in the presence of increasing concentrations of constitutively active MEK1 plasmid .
Similarly , cells were transfected with TATA-DR1-Luc reporter vector and constitutively active MEK1 plasmid in the presence of increasing concentrations of constitutively active MEKK1 plasmid .
The results obtained demonstrate ( Fig .
7 ) that the inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription by MEKK1 could only be partially reversed by the expression of constitutively active MEK1 .
In contrast , the up-regulation of RXRE-driven transcription by MEK1 was completely inhibited by constitutively active MEKK1 in a dose-dependent manner .
These data show that , when activated alone , JNK and ERK pathways have opposite effect on RXRE-driven transcription .
However , when activated together , JNK-dependent inhibition becomes dominant over ERK-mediated up-regulation .
Previous reports have shown that Abs to CD3 induce activation of ERK and not of JNK ( 33 , 34 ) .
To investigate whether CD3-induced ERK activation would result in the increases in RXRE-dependent transcription , Jurkat cells were treated with OKT3 either in the presence or absence of 9-CRA , following transfection with TATA-DR1-Luc .
The data in Fig .
54 show that there was no increase but about 35 % loss of RXRE-driven transcription following treatment of transfected cells with OKT3 .
Interestingly , when we assayed OKT3 treated Jurkat cells for ERK and JNK activation ( data not shown ) , we found that both were activated although ERK was activated at a higher level than JNK .

These data further support the finding that T cell activation inhibits the RXRE-dependent transcription and JNK effect is dominant in inhibiting RXRE-mediated transcription , when both JNK and ERK are activated simultaneously .
Relatively lower inhibition of RXRE-dependent transcription by OKT3 as compared with 75 % inhibition induced by PMA + PHA may be due to low level JNK activation by anti-CD3 as compared with treatment with PMA + PHA .
Discussion To explore the role of retinoid receptors in T cell biology , we have investigated the regulation of RXRa expression and its function in T lymphocytes .
Previously , we have shown that RXRa « levels in resting human PBMCs are reduced following activation and transition from G , /G , to S phase of the cell cycle and the low levels are maintained throughout active cell division and proliferation ( 29 ) .
In the present study , we demonstrate that the expression of RXRa is modulated differently during the activation of cycling T cells .
Surprisingly , we found that the levels of RXRa expression were significantly increased in these cells after activation , unlike the activation of resting PBMCs , which resulted in the loss of RXRa expression as previously reported ( 29 ) .
Taken together , the data suggest the existence of dual regulatory signals that control RXRa expression during the activation of resting and cycling T cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
These signals have distinct characteristics ; the activation signals that lead to G/G , to S switch and proliferation of resting cells result in the down-regulation of RXRa , whereas the activation 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology 45- TATA-DR1-Lue p C to T. m T ro on L ho O L P on L % Relative Luciferase Activity ( x10° ) R FZ W sy Gifs ss o MEK1DA MEK1DA+ 2.5 ug MEKK1DA MEK1DA+5.0 ug MEKK1DA MEKK1DA+2.5 ug MEK1DA MEKK1DA+5.0 ug MEK1DA FIGURE 7 .
Dominant effect of MEKK1 expression on RXRE-driven transcriptional activity during coexpression of constitutively active MEKK1 and MEK1 .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 pg of TATA-DR1-Luc in the absence or presence of either constitutively active MEKK1 or MEK 1 plasmids ( 5 pg ) and indicated concentrations of either constitutively active MEK1 or MEKK1 plasmids , respectively .
Cells were harvested after 36 h and luciferase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods .
The values represent the mean of three independent experiments with SE calculated for each value .
signals leading to the inhibition of cell growth of the cycling T cells result in the accumulation of RXRa .
Although the physiological relevance of accumulated RXRa is not yet understood , fine tuning of levels of RXRa expression may have important immu-nological consequences in the positive and negative selection of T lymphocytes and in the regulation of T lymphocyte-dependent immune responses .
RXRs are known to play an important role as promiscuous heterodimerization partners in modulating the activities of a number of nuclear receptors , which include RAR ( 36 ) , thyroid hormone receptor ( 36 , 37 ) , vitamin D receptor ( 36 ) , peroxisome proliferator activated receptors ( 38 ) , and COUP-TF ( 39 ) .
Dynamic regulation of RXRa expression is probably an important mechanism allowing T cells to calibrate their responses to different levels of stimuli .
To gain some insight into the mechanism of RXRa induction , we investigated whether the up-regulation of RXRa involves pathways similar to IL-2 pathways , and studied the effect of CsA on the RXRa expression during activation .
There was a significant enhancement of RXRa mRNA and protein expression when activation was conducted in the presence of CsA , although under similar conditions there was a marked inhibition of IL-2 expression .
These results suggest that two divergent pathways are involved in the activation-induced IL-2 synthesis and activation-associated accumulation of RXRa .
Although the mechanism of CsA-induced up-regulation of RXRa during T cell activation remains unknown , our data suggest a link between the pathways that regulate RXRa levels and pathways involving calmodulin-dependent activation of serine-threonine phosphatase CN ( 40 ) .

Dual regulatory control of RXRa : expression during activation of resting and cycling T lymphocytes .
A , Quiescent PBT cells ( which are in G/G , phase of cell cycle ) can be activated by in vitro treatment with T cell activation agents like OKT3 or PMA/ION , to express IL-2 and proliferate .
The proliferating T cells express low levels of RXRa : as compared with resting cells ( 29 ) .
B , Restimulation of actively cycling PBT cells or T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines leads to IL-2 expression , inhibition of proliferation , and AICD .
Under these conditions , the expression of RXRa is elevated .
Cycling T Cell 9-CRA is a ligand for RXRa that is important for RXRE-mediated transcription and has been shown to have immunomodula-tory effect .
Although 9-CRA did not prevent the activation-induced growth inhibition ( data not shown ) , it surprisingly prevented the up-regulation of RXRa expression .
9-CRA-mediated and transcriptionally regulated inhibition of RXRa up-regulation is suggestive of the ability of retinoids to modulate the synthesis of their own receptors .
The mechanism of such inhibition is not understood and may involve a general mechanism rather than a direct effect on RXRa .
Retinoids have been known to antagonize the biological effects of phorbol esters , and it has been suggested that the modulation of T cell function by retinoids may be mediated by their influence on protein kinase C ( 41 ) .
Interestingly , the levels of IL-2 mRNA were also nearly completely down-regulated when the activation was performed in the presence 9-CRA .
The mechanism of 9-CRA-induced inhibition of IL-2 up-regulation remains to be studied and could possibly involve mechanisms similar to RAR-selective ligand-induced down-regulation of IL-2 promoter reported earlier ( 42 ) .
We provide evidence that RXRa accumulated during the activation of Jurkat cells is transcriptionally inactive and activation leads to the silencing of RXRE-mediated gene transcription .
Our data show that two important MAP kinase signaling pathways , JNK and ERK , both of which are activated during T cell activation ( 15-18 , 35 , 43 ) , are involved in the regulation of RXRE-mediated gene transcription .
To the best of our knowledge , there are no earlier reports of MEKK1 or MEK 1 pathways regulating the transactivation function of RXRa in T cells .
Although we can not rule out the role of other pathways regulating the RXRE-driven transcription during T cell activation , our data provide direct evidence that JNK pathway inhibits , whereas ERK pathway stimulates , RXRE-driven transcription , and JNK pathway is dominant over ERK pathway when both are simultaneously activated .
These data are consistent with the existence , in the T cells , of a dynamic balance between the JNK and ERK pathways in regulating the RXRE-driven transactivation function .
A recent study has shown that activation of JNK pathway and inhibition of ERK pathway is critical for apoptosis in rat PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells , and ERK activation may play a role in the proliferation and survival ( 44 ) .
In T lymphocytes , ERK and p38 pathways have also been implicated in the regulation of positive and negative selection , respectively ( 45 ) .
TCR engagement and treatment of cycling T cells 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 4224 with PMA and PHA is known to activate signals leading to AICD and JNK being an important pathway in modulating AICD , it is possible that even if both JNK and ERK pathways are operative , the JNK pathway is dominant and results in the inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription .
Conversely , ERK pathway may represent a dominant pathway during T cell proliferation and survival .
The mechanism involved in the JNK-pathway mediated loss of RXRE-dependent transcription remains unknown .
In a recent study ( 46 ) , hyperphosphorylation of RXRa by JNK in UV irradiated COS-1 cells did not effect RXRE-dependent transcription , indicating that direct phosphorylation of RXRa may not contribute to MEKK1-induced down-regulation of RXRE-dependent transcription .
It is likely that some yet unknown MEKK1l-activated intermediate protein ( s ) is involved in this inhibition .
This factor ( s ) may have a role in the inhibition of RXRE-mediated gene transcription either by displacing some important cofactor or through some other mechanism and needs further investigation .
Nuclear hormone receptors and AP-1 mutually antagonize each other functionally , either by recognizing common regulatory se-quences , a phenomenon termed cross-coupling ( 47 , 48 ) , or by physically interacting with each other ( 49 ) .
Recently , other mechanisms have been described to explain the antagonism , which include competition for limiting amounts of CREB-binding protein ( 50 ) , and nuclear hormone receptor dependent inhibition of JNK pathway ( 51 ) .
JNK activates c-Jun by phosphorylation on Ser-63/73 in the amino-terminal region ( 52 , 53 ) .
In addition , two other proteins ATF-2 and ELK-1 , which are involved in the induction of c-Fos , are also activated by JNK ( 54 , 55 ) .
It can be speculated that one possible mechanism for the JNK-mediated suppression of RXRE function reported in this study may involve antagonism of RXRE-dependent transcription by JNK-activated AP1 elements , c-Jun and c-Fos .
We have shown that MEKK1 and MEK1 modulate the transcriptional function of both constitutive and overexpressed RXRa , in the absence of T cell activation , suggesting that MAPK pathways regulate RXRE-driven transcription independent of RXRa levels .
Because CsA treatment enhances the RXRa accumulation but has no effect on the inhibition of RXRE-driven transcription following T cell activation , one may speculate that CN pathways regulate only the expression of RXRa levels .
Since T cell activation involves stimulation of both CN and MAPK pathways , accumulation of RXRa and inhibition of its function may be a consequence of stimulation of both of these pathways .
Thus the levels of RXRa alone may not be a measure of its function .
Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of other cellular factors seem to play a critical role in defining the RXRE-dependent transcription function .
Because the activation of cycling T cells eventually signals the growth inhibition and AICD , loss of RXRE-dependent transcription may be one of the early outcomes of such signaling that is essential for shutting down the cellular machinery and mediating AICD .
