P. ] Abstract To determine the contribution of BRCAI and BRCA2 mutations to the pathogenesis of male breast cancer in Hungary , the country with the highest male breast cancer mortality rates in continental Europe , a series of 18 male breast cancer patients and three patients with gynecomastia was analyzed for germ-line mutations in both BRCAI and BRCA2 .
Although no germ-line BRCAI mutation was observed , 6 of the 18 male breast cancer cases ( 33 % ) carried truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene .
Unexpectedly , none of them reported a family history for breast/ ovarian cancer .
Four of six truncating mutations were novel , and two mutations were recurrent .
Four patients ( 22 % ) had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first- or second-degree relative ; however , no BRCA2 mutation was identified among them .
No mutation was identified in either of the genes in the gynecomastias .
These results provide evidence for a strong genetic component of male breast cancer in Hungary .
Introduction Male breast cancer is a rare disease , comprising < 1 % of all malignancies in men in the western world ; however , in some developing areas , it is more frequent , accounting for 6-15 % of all breast cancers . ''
In continental Europe , the Hungarians have the highest male breast cancer mortality rates ( 1 ) .
The biggest risk factor for breast cancer in both genders seems to be inherited predisposition .
Approximately 5-10 % of female breast cancer cases are due to inheritance of autosomal dominant susceptibility genes ( 2 ) .
In the vast majority of inherited cases , the recently isolated genes BRCA I and BRCAZ are thought to be responsible for the disease ( 3 ) .
BRCA !
is estimated to account for most female breast/ovarian cancer families , but it can be infrequently detected in families with male breast cancer cases .
However , breast cancer-prone families in whom male breast cancer occurred have been shown to be linked to or have mutation in BRCAZ ( 4 ) .
Our earlier results did not reveal BRCAZ carrier male breast cancer patients in Hungarian breast cancer families , but two individuals without family history were found to carry BRCAZ mutations ( 5 ) .
Very little is yet known about the genetic background of male breast cancer .
Somatic mutations of the p53 gene were identified in 41 % of male breast cancer patients studied ( 6 ) .
Defects in only a few genes have been associated with predisposition to the development of this disease .
Genetic abnormalities of the androgen receptor have been reported in association with male breast cancer cases ( 7 ) .

3 Breast Cancer in Men .
http : //interact.withus.com/interact/mbc/ .
995 ( 8-10 ) , but in all cases the patients with male breast cancer were members of families carrying BRCAI mutation .
There is much more evidence that inherited BRCAZ mutations increase the risk for developing male breast cancer .
Several families that also contained male breast cancer patients were reported to carry BRCA2Z mutations ( 4 , 11-13 ) .
Men who carry a germ-line BRCAZ mutation have an increased risk of breast cancer ( 14 ) .
Although men with breast cancer also often have gynecomastia , it is still unknown whether gynecomastia per se predisposes the male breast to malignant disease .
Some authors report that as many as 20-36 % of the male breast cancer patients in their studies have a history of gynecomastia ( 15 , 16 ) .
In the present study , we have determined the contribution of germline mutations in the BRCAI and BRCAZ genes to the pathogenesis of male breast cancer in Hungary by screening a series of 18 unselected male breast cancer patients and three patients with gynecomastia .
Materials and Methods Patients .
Blood samples were collected from all consenting patients with male breast cancer or gynecomastia at the National Institute of Oncology ( Budapest , Hungary ) in the period of 1996-1998 .
The histopathological typing of the cases was completed by board-certified pathologists .
This panel represents consecutive cases who were not selected for family history of breast/ ovarian cancer ; however , information on family history was available for all patients .
The patients with gynecomastia did not have a medical history of Klinefelter syndrome .
BRCA1 and BRCA Mutation Screening .
Genomic DNA was extracted by standard methods from peripheral lymphocytes from all patients .
PCR amplification of 160-550-bp DNA fragments covering the entire BRCA2 coding region and splice junctions was carried out by using a set of 44 primer pairs ( 5 , 11 ) .
Similarly , all exons with the exception of exon 11 were amplified with a set of 23 primer pairs ; exon 11 was screened in three overlapping protein truncation test fragments as reported previously ( 5 ) .
Mu-tational screening was performed in germ-line DNA by combined multiple heteroduplex analysis and/or by single strand conformation analysis .
Mutation screening in both genes was performed irrespective of identification of a mutation in one gene , because it is possible that mutations of both BRCA ] and BRCA2 may be segregating in a family , as we reported in a Hungarian breast/ovarian cancer patient ( 17 ) .
PCR products from variant conformers were purified using Wizard PCR Prep DNA Purification System ( Promega Corp. ) and sequenced using the Thermosequenase Cyclo Sequencing kit ( USB-Am-ersham ) .
Results The entire coding regions and intronic splice sites of both BRCALI and BRCA2 were screened using multiple heteroduplex analysis/single-strand conformation analysis and protein truncation test , followed by direct sequencing of abnormalities .
Six of the 18 male breast cancer cases ( 33 % ) were observed to carry truncating mutations in the BRCAZ gene ( Table 1 ) .
Four of the six truncating mutations were novel ; the other two alterations ( 277delAC and 9326insA ) were reported earlier ( 5 , 18 , 19 ) .
A review was conducted of the clinical and family history of the mutation carriers .

None of them reported a family history for breast/ovarian cancer .
Two patients ( 11 % ) had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first-degree relative and another two ( 11 % ) in at least one second-degree relative in this unselected study ; however , no BRCA2 mutation was observed among them .
No germ-line BRCAI mutations were detected in the male breast cancer cases , nor was a mutation identified in either BRCALI or BRCAZ in the three cases of gynecomastia ; however , one patient ( G2 ) from this group carried an unclassified BRCAZ variant allele with unclear significance ( Table 2 ) .
There was no difference between mutation carriers and noncarriers with respect to clinicopathological features nor age at diagnosis ( Table 3 ) .
The average age at diagnosis was 62 years ; there was only an insignificant difference between the mean age of onset of carriers ( 58 years ) and noncarriers ( 64 years ) .
Discussion In the first studies of BRCAZ analysis ( 4 , 11 ) , the subjects of scrutiny were mostly large families that sometimes also contained members with male breast cancer .
In more recent reports ( 20-22 ) , sets of population-based male breast cancer cases were studied for the frequency of germ-line BRCAZ carriers .
Here we analyzed male breast cancer patients from a hospital-based study to determine the contribution of BRCAL and BRCAZ mutations to the pathogenesis of male breast cancer in Hungary .
Frequencies reported of BRCAZ mutations in male breast cancer vary between 4 % ( 21 ) and 40 % ( 23 ) , the latter results are possibly influenced by a strong founder effect in that particular population .
In contrast to reports by Friedman et al .
( 21 ) and Mavraki et al .
( 20 ) , who found 4 and 7 % of patients carrying germ-line BRCAZ mutations , respectively , in the present study a large proportion of cases was found to carry BRCA2Z mutations ( 6 of 18 ; 33 % ) .
These results are even higher than the recent reports of Haraldsson et al .
( 22 ) , who identified 21 % of all cases to be BRCA2 mutation carriers .
Although in some large BRCA ] families male breast cancer patients have been shown to have germ-line BRCAI mutations ( 8-10 ) , in the present study , as in the study of Friedman et al .
( 21 ) , no BRCAI mutations were found .
This indicates that BRCA J germ-line mutations do not contribute substantially to male breast cancer .
In the present study , six BRCAZ mutations were identified among the male breast cancer patients .
The mutations were all frameshifts predicted to result in truncated proteins .
This is in agreement with previous findings , that > 85 % of BRCA mutations identified cause protein truncation ( 21 ) .
Four of six truncating mutations were novel ; the other two alterations have been reported earlier .
The 277delAC mutation was reported from the United States in a large family that also contained three cases of male breast cancer ( 18 ) .
The other recurrent mutation ( 9326insA ) was first identified in Hungary ( 5 ) and has also been observed in a Hungarian male breast cancer patient living in Sweden ( 22 ) and in a French breast-ovarian cancer family that did not contain male breast cancer ( 19 ) .
Several additional Hungarian breast cancer families were identified to carry 9326insA , all without male breast cancer cases .
* In a recent international collaborative study , we identified a common founding haplotype for this mutation ( 26 ) , and we have indication for a common origin of 9326insA from the Central-Eastern European region . ''
The mutations we found in this study are located in exons 2 , 7 , 11 , 16 , and 23 ( Table 1 and Fig .
1 ) .
This is not notably different from the distribution of either BRCAZ mutation spectra in male breast cancers from other studies ( Fig .
1 ) or of all BRCA2 mutations . ''
Thus , there is no evidence to date that mutations in specific domains of BRCAZ may be associated with male breast cancer .
The 18 breast cancer patients screened for germ-line BRCA mutations were selected without any regard for family history .
However , information on family history was available for all patients ( Table 3 ) .
In the present study , the proportion of patients with family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first-degree relative was 11 % ( 2 of 18 ) , and in at least one second-degree relative , also 11 % ( 2/18 ) .
This is in agreement with the studies of Rosenblatt ef al .
( 24 ) and Friedman et al .
( 21 ) , who found similar proportions in their studies ( 18-10 % and 17-13 % , respectively ) .
Surprisingly , no BRCAZ2 mutation was identified among the cases with family history ; neither did the mutation carriers report family histories of breast/ovarian cancer .
This is in contrast with the results of Couch et al .
( 11 ) , who identified germ-line BRCAZ mutations in 7 of 50 ( 14 % ) male breast cancer cases , 6 of 7 ( 85 % ) of whom had a family history of breast cancer .
Friedman et al .
( 21 ) found two mutation carriers in their panel , one of whom had a family history .
Similarly to our results , Haraldsson et al .
( 22 ) reported recently that only one of seven BRCA2Z mutation carriers had a positive family history of breast cancer .
No evidence for differences in clinicopathological features was seen between mutation carriers and noncarriers .
Most patients had invasive ductal carcinoma ( 17 of 18 ; 95 % ) , including all germ-line BRCA2 mutation carriers ( Table 3 ) .
This is consistent with literature data that invasive ductal carcinomas account for 84-93 % of cases ( 25 ) .
The average age of men at diagnosis of breast cancer is close to 65 , about 5 years older than the average age for women . ''
In our studies , the average age at diagnosis in carriers was not significantly lower than that of noncarriers .
Compared with other BRCAZ mutations , 9326insA appears to be linked with younger age of onset in female breast cancer ( 26 ) and possibly also in male breast cancer ( 22 ) .
No mutation was identified in either of the genes in the three cases of gynecomastia ; however , one patient ( G2 ) from this group carried a missense BRCAZ variant allele ( 7O81A-G ) with unclear signifi-cance .
This alteration was reported eight times in the Breast Cancer Information Core as an unclassified variant and lies in a conserved region of the gene in human , rat , and mouse ; however , expression analysis would be required to elucidate the nature of this type of alteration .

A A 277delAC 999del5 The data presented here imply that germ-line mutations in the BRCAZ2 gene are involved in the development of one-third of male breast cancer cases in Hungary .
There may be other genetic factors that are responsible for some of the male breast cancers that can not be explained by mutations in the BRCAZ gene .
There is no evidence for a male breast cancer-specific cluster region in the BRCAZ gene thus far , but because the majority of BRCA2Z mutations found in male breast cancer are unique and not identified in female breast cancer cases , it is possible that at least some BRCA2 mutations may predispose to male rather than female breast cancer .
On the other hand , certain mutations ( e.g. , 9326insA ) result in both male and female breast cancers and can be associated with various phenotypes in different families .
This could be explained by mod 9326insA 4486delG 6174delT ifying factors in disease development different in males and fe-males .
The first evidence of a modifying genetic factor of BRCAZ in male breast cancer was provided recently ( 27 ) , reporting that an interstitial tandem duplication on 9p increases the risk of breast cancer in male patients conferred by BRCAZ .
The lack of a positive family history in all carriers suggests that at least some BRCA2 mutations may have a lower penetrance than others , and selection of putative BRCAZ mutation carriers among male breast cancer patients can not be based on the family background of the disease .
Our data provide further evidence that in certain populations there is a high genetic component in the development of this disease , and in these populations all patients with male breast cancer , regardless of their family history , should be screened for BRCAZ mutations .
