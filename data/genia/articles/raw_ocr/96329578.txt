LYSP100-Associated Nuclear Domains ( LANDs ) : Description of a New Class of Subnuclear Structures and Their Relationship to PML Nuclear Bodies By Alexander L. Dent , Jonathan Yewdell , Francine Puvion-Dutilleul , Marcel H.M. Koken , Hugues de The , and Louis M. Staudt The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor a ( RARa ) gene in t ( 15 ; 17 ) acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , creating a PML-RARa « fusion oncoprotein .
The PML gene product has been localized to subnuclear dot-like structures variously termed PODs , ND10s , Kr bodies , or PML nuclear bodies { PML NBs ) .
The present study describes the cloning of a lymphoid-restricted gene , LYSP100 , that is homologous to another protein that localizes to PML NBs , SP100 .
In addition to SP100 homology regions , one LYSP100 cDNA isoform contains a bromodomain and a PHD/TTC domain , which are present in a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins .
By immunofluorescence , LYSP100 was localized to nuclear dots that were surprisingly largely nonoverlapping with PML NBs .
However , a minority of LYSP100 nuclear dots exactly colocalized with PML and SP100 .
We term the LYSP100 HE INTERPHASE CELL nucleus is compartmentalized into different structural domains that are important for nuclear function ( see Spector ' for review ) .
The nucleolus , the most prominent subnuclear domain , assembles ribosomes .
Other classes of subnuclear domains , such as interchromatin granules , interchromatin fibrils , coiled bodies , and nuclear bodies ( NBs ) , were initially defined as morphologically distinct structures by electron microscopy ( EM ) .
Subsequently , antibody probes have been used to distinguish subnuclear domains biochemically .
For example , a variety of splicing factors have been localized to both interchromatin granules and coiled bodies .
The processes of transcription , splicing , and DNA replication have been shown to take place in localized regions of the nucleus , although the relation of these events to the morphologically defined subnuclear structures remains to be fully elucidated .
An ultrastructurally distinct subnuclear structure , variously termed the PML NB , '' POD , * NDI1O0 , ° or Kr body , ° has recently been studied intensively due to the observation that the PML protein localizes to this domain . ''
Interest in the PML gene derives from its involvement in the characteristic t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .
* '' By immunofluorescence , the wild-type PML protein localizes to five to 15 dot-like or ring-like domains in the nucleus .
** '' '' '' '' '' '' '' Using immuno-EM , PML was detected in annular or dot-like , electron-dense structures in the nucleoplasm , 0.3 to 1 wm in diameter .
* '' ' '' PML preferentially localized over the electron-dense outer ring of these structures .
This PML-containing structure is morphologically similar to a subclass of NBs previously defined by EM ( re-viewed in Brasch and Ochs '' ) , and thus we will term this structure a PML NB in the present study .
Although the normal function of PML NBs has remained elusive , a clue to their importance comes from the observation that DNA viruses encode proteins that localize to PML NBs transiently and subsequently disrupt the structures .
`` `` '' * The t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation of APL results in the expression of a fusion oncoprotein in which PML is fused to the retinoic acid receptor a ( RARa ) .
*° '' '' In APL cells , the characteristic PML NB structures are absent and , instead , Blood , Vol 88 , No 4 ( August 15 ) , 1996 : pp 1423-1436 structures `` LANDs , '' for LYSP10O0-associated nuclear domains .
Although LYSP100 is expressed only in lymphoid cells , LANDs could be visualized in HeLa cells by transfection of a LYSP100 cDNA .
Immunoelectron microscopy revealed LANDs to be globular , electron-dense structures morphologically distinct from the annular structures characteristic of PML NBs .
LANDs were most often found in the nucleoplasm , but were also found at the nuclear membrane and in the cytoplasm , suggesting that these structures may traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus .
By double-immuno-gold labeling of PML and LYSP100 , some LANDs were shown to contain both PML and LYSP100 .
Thus , PML is localized to a second subnuclear domain that is morphologically and biochemically distinct from PML NBs .

PML is localized to a large number of much smaller nuclear dots .
`` * '' APL patients treated with retinoic acid undergo a clinical remission resulting from the differentiation of leuke-mic cells into mature granulocytes and a concomitant decrease in proliferation ( see Grignani et al '' for review ) .
Interestingly , treatment of APL cells with retinoic acid causes reformation of the normal PML NB structures , leading to speculation that disruption of these subnuclear domains is integral to malignant transformation by PML RARa .
`` * Wild-type PML can suppress the growth and malignant phenotype of transformed cells , '' '' again suggesting that interference with PML function might contribute to the pathogen-esis of APL .
In the present study , we characterized a novel lymphoid-restricted protein , LYSP100 , that is homologous to SP100 , a protein that colocalizes with PML in PML NBs .
SP100 was originally defined as an antigen detected by autoantisera from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis , '' and is one of several proteins of unknown function that are found in PML NBs. > '' ° Using confocal microscopy and EM , we unexpectedly found that LYSP100 localized to a new class of subnuclear structures , which we term LANDs ( LYSP100-associated nuclear domains ) , that are morphologically and spatially distinct from PML NBs .

1424 calizes with LYSP1IOO0 in some LANDs , thus defining LANDs as a new PML-containing subnuclear structure .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of LYSP100 .
- Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -ampli-fiable cDNA enriched for lymphoid-restricted genes was obtained by subtractive hybridization of cDNA from the Burkitt 's lymphoma line , Raji , with mRNA from the erythroleukemia line , K562.°* This amplified cDNA was used to construct a subtracted cDNA library as previously described . ''
Twelve hundred ninety clones from the resultant subtracted library were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing and evaluated for homology using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ( BLAST ) algorithm .
A partial cDNA clone , AD2511 , was found to have high homology with the amino-terminal region of SP100 .
The AD2511 partial LYSP100 cDNA clone was used to screen a large-insert Lambda-ZAP ( Stratagene La Jolla , CA ) cDNA library prepared from the Raji cell line .
cDNA library screening and other DNA manipulations were performed using standard techniques . ''
DNA sequencing was performed using the Applied Biosystems ( ABI ; Foster City , CA ) 373 Sequencer and PRISM ( ABI ) sequencing mixes .
The sequences of LYSP1I00 cDNA isoforms , LYSP100-A and LYSP100-B ( Fig 2A ) , have been submitted to Genbank and assigned accession numbers U36499 and U36500 , respec-tively .
Cloning of alternate SP 100 isoforms .
_ A Pstl-Xbal fragment derived from LYSP100-A , which has sequences identical to the LYSP100-B/human nuclear phosphoprotein ( HNPP ) -like domain , was used to screen a HeLa cDNA library ( Stratagene ) .
A 2.7-kb cDNA clone obtained from this screen , termed HFPX , was sequenced and found to contain a short open reading frame ( 49 amino acids ) with very high homology to the carboxy-terminus of LYSP100-B .
The region of HFPX with the highest homology to LYSP100-B was used to design the following nested antisense PCR primers : ( 1 ) outer primer , S-ATATCCGAATTCCCTTCACCG-CACCACAGGTCAC-3 ' , and ( 2 ) inner primer , 5'-TGGAAGTAA-AGGAGCCTGAAAATC-3 ' .
These primers were used for reverse transcriptase-PCR ( cDNA cycle kit ; Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) on Raji mRNA in combination with the following primers from the 3 '' end of SP100 : ( 1 ) outer primer , 5'-TGGAACGAATTCAGACCT-GAGTAATGGAGAAGAG-3 ' , and ( 2 ) inner primer , 5-CTTCAG-GAAACCTGCAGCTCATCC-3 ' .
Specificity of the initial PCR product using the outer primers was verified using the inner primers .
A 400-bp product from the initial amplification was digested with EcoRI and cloned into pBluescript ( Stratagene ) .
The sequence of the PCR product showed a novel alternatively spliced form of SP100 , and the subcloned PCR product was then used as a probe to screen the Raji cDNA library described earlier .
Four independent SP100 cDNA clones derived from this screen were analyzed , and all four clones had similar open reading frames that were truncated with respect to the carboxy-terminus of LYSP100-B ( Fig 2A ) .
The DNA sequence of the SP100-B isoform has been submitted to Genbank and assigned accession number U36501 .

Female New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with a primary boost of 500 ug soluble GST-fusion protein , followed by an initial boost with 200 ug protein 4 weeks later plus subsequent boosts every 2 weeks also with 200 ug protein .
Blood samples were taken 12 days after every boost .
GST alone and GST -fusion proteins were coupled to Affigel ( BioRad , Richmond , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's specifications and used for affinity purification of LYSP100 and SP100 antibodies .
Briefly , antiserum was diluted 1:5 in 10 mmol/L Tris ( pH 7.5 ) buffer and passed several times over a GST-alone Affigel column to remove anti-GST specificities .
Diluted antiserum was next passed over the respective GST-fusion protein column several times and washed extensively with Tris buffer .

Transfection of HeLa cells .
A mammalian expression vector for LYSP100-B was created by cloning LYSP100-B cDNA into the vector pCGN®Y as follows .
LYSP100-B cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers : AGCAGGGCCAGCAGG3 ' and S'TTTTTTGGATCCTATTTT-AGGGTGCCATTTGCTGAAT3 ' .
The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BamHI and ligated into the same sites in pCGN .
For transfection , HeLa cells were plated at 25 % confluency on glass cover slips in the wells of a 24-well plate and grown in Dulbecco 's modified essential medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
Cells were transfected with the CaPO , procedure using 1 ug pCGN-LYSP100-B DNA per well .
After addition of DNA , cells were incubated for 16 hours at 37°C and then placed in fresh media .
Cells were grown on the cover slips for an additional 24 hours before staining with anti-LYSP100 antibodies , as already described .
Immuno-EM .
_ MBBI cell cultures were fixed for 1 hour at 4°C with 4 % formaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer ( pH 7.3 ) .
During fixation , the cells were scraped from the plastic substratum and centrifuged .
Pellets of fixed material were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol and embedded in Lowieryl K4M ( Chemische Werke Lowi , Waldkraiburg , Germany ) at low temperature as previously described . '' ''
Polymerization was performed for 5 days at -30°C under long-wavelength UV light .
Formvar carbon-coated copper grids ( mesh 200 ) bearing ultrathin sections of Lowi-cryl-embedded material were stained for immunogold detection by first incubating in a bovine serum albumin solution for 30 minutes to suppress nonspecific binding .
Grids were then floated on 10-uL drops of an LYSP100 antibody solution diluted to 10 Lg/mL in PBS for 2 hours at 25°C .
After a 15-minute wash in PBS , the grids were floated for 30 minutes on a 10-4L drop of a 1:25 dilution of goat antirabbit IgG conjugated to gold particles 10 nm in diameter ( Biocell Research Laboratories , Cardiff , UK ) .
For double staining , uncoated grids ( mesh 300 ) were first stained for LYSP100 on one side as already described , and then the opposite sides of the grids were stained similarly for PML using 15-nm gold particle-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG .

Expression of LYSP100 mRNA in human lymphoid cell lines and tissues .
A Northern blot was prepared using 2 ug poly ( A ) * mRNA from human cell lines ( lanes 1 to 11 ) or tissues ( lanes 12 to 17 ) and hybridized with a radiolabeled LYSP100 probe or a GADPH probe .
Cell lines : HeLa , cervical carcinoma ; K562 , _ myeloerythroleukemia ; Hut78 and Jurkat , T cell ; Nalm6 , pre-B cell ; and Raji , BJAB , MBB1 , VDSO , WIL2-NS , and ARHKH77 , mature B cell .
LYSP100 % 1425 all steps were performed normally but the primary antibody was omitted .
RESULTS LYSP100 gene characterization .
- In an effort to identify novel lymphoid-restricted transcription factors , we combined subtractive cDNA methodology with random automated DNA sequencing .
A subtracted cDNA library was prepared that was enriched for genes expressed in the Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , Raji , and not in the erythroleukemia cell line , K562 . ''
One subtracted cDNA clone was chosen for study by virtue of its homology with an autoantigen , $ P100 , °° '' that had been previously localized to PML NB subnuclear domains . ''
Northern blot analysis showed that this gene was expressed as three major mRNA transcripts , 0.9 , 1.6 , and 3.0 kb in length , that were detected in all three lymphoid tissues examined ( spleen , thymus , and tonsil ) but not in three nonlymphoid tissues ( Fig 1 ) .
LYSP100 mRNA was expressed in all mature B-lymphocyte and plasma cell lines tested ( Fig 1 , and data not shown ) , but it was only variably expressed in T-lymphocyte lines and was not detectable in several nonlymphoid cell lines ( Fig 1 ) .
Expression of the gene is thus lymphoid-restricted both in human tissues and in cell lines .
Consequently , we named this gene LYSP100 , for lymphoid-restricted homologue of SP100 .
By contrast , SP100 expression is widespread '' '' * '' '' ( and AL .
Dent , unpublished results , January 1994 ) .
To isolate full-length LYSP100 cDNAs , a Raji cDNA library was screened with the partial LYSP100 cDNA , and two cDNA clones , both 3.0 kb long , were chosen for further analysis ( Fig 2A ) .
The sequences of LYSP100-A and LYSP100-B cDNAs have identical 5 '' and 3 ' sequences but differ by two short insertions in the middle of the LYSP100-B cDNA , which probably result from alternative splicing .

probe derived from the LYSP100-B HNPP homology region .
Based on the sequence of a novel -like clone isolated from this screen , PCR primers were designed that were used with SP100 primers to amplify a novel SP100 isoform from Raji cDNA .
Sequencing of a full-length cDNA for this SP100 isoform , termed SP100-B , revealed that it is identical to SP100-A over the first 477 amino acids , but it has a carboxy-terminal extension that is highly similar to but shorter than the carboxy-terminal domain of LYSP100-B ( Fig 2A and B ) .
Thus , the LYSP100-B and SP100-B iso- forms share amino acid similarity throughout the length of the predicted proteins ( Fig 2B ) , suggesting that these two proteins had a common evolutionary precursor .
Further sequence analysis of the LYSP100-B isoform revealed two additional domains found in a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins : a PHD/TTC domain'** ' and a bromodomain* '' ( Fig 2B and C ) .
The PHD/TTC domain is a cysteine-rich motif with the general structure , C , HC ; , that is presumed to coordinate zinc .
Interestingly , like LYSP100 B , several coactivator proteins contain both a PHD/TTC domain and a bromodomain , including TIF1 , * '' CREB binding factor , '' and p300 .
* The PHD/TTC domain and bromodomain of LYSP100-B are most closely related to those of TIF1 , a potential transcriptional coactivator for nuclear hormone receptors . ''
In addition , the spacer regions between PHD/TTC domains and bromodomains of LYSP100-B and TIFI are similar in length and have homology to each other ( Fig 2C ) , suggesting that the carboxy termini of these two proteins may have related functions .
Taken together , the presence of the PHD/TTC domain and bromodomain in LYSP100-B suggests that LYSP100-B may be involved in transcriptional regulation .

Western blot analysis of LYSP100 protein .
Nuclear or whole-cell extracts were prepared from B-cell lines expressing LYSP100 mRNA ( ARH77 and Raji ) or from cell lines lacking LYSP100 mRNA ( K562 and Reh ) and analyzed by immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-LYSP100 antibodies .
Arrows indicate multiple LYSP100 protein isoforms .
LYSP100 antibodies should also recognize the LYSP100-B isoform , since most of the LYSP100-A carboxy terminus is shared by LYSP100-B ( Fig 2A and B ) .
Specificity of the anti-LYSP100 antibodies was tested by Western blot analysis of nuclear and whole-cell extracts ( Fig 3 ) .
A set of protein isoforms was observed in cells that express LYSP 100 mRNA ( ARH77 and Raji ) , but not in cells lacking LYSP 100 mRNA ( K562 and REH ) .
The LYSP100 isoforms ranged in size from 65 to 150 kD and may represent the products of alternatively spliced LYSP100 mRNAs or may include proteolytic degradation products .
In vitro translation of LYSP100-A and LYSP100-B isoforms showed that the protein products migrate more slowly in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels than predicted by the DNA sequence , as previously observed for SP100*° ( and A.L.D. , data not shown ) .
By this criterion , LYSP100-A mRNA can account for the 65-kD LYSP100 protein isoform seen on Western blots , and LYSP100-B mRNA can account for the 150-kD LYSP100 protein iso-form .
In addition , the 100-kD LYSP100 protein appears to be encoded by another LSYP100 cDNA isoform ( A.L.D. , data not shown ) .
The lower-molecular-weight bands on the Western blots were detected in all cells regardless of LYSP100 mRNA levels , and therefore represent cross-reacting protein species ( Fig 3 ) .
Next , subcellular localization of LYSP100 was investigated using the affinity-purified anti-LYSP100 antibodies for immunofluorescent staining and confocal laser microscopy of the MBBI1 human lymphoblastoid cell line and human peripheral blood B lymphocytes ( Fig 4 ) .
LYSP 100 localized to five to 20 dot-like structures in the nucleus of MBBI1 cells ( Fig 4A , D , and G ) .
LYSP100-associated dots were also detected in nontransformed human peripheral blood B cells ( Fig 41 , 3 cells shown ) .
On average , the number of LYSP100-associated dots was significantly lower in peripheral blood DENT ET AL B cells than in the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell line : one to three structures were seen per peripheral blood B cell , with some cells having no detectable dots .
LYSP100 was detected in nuclear dots regardless of whether the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde , methanol , or acetone , and nuclear localization of LYSP100 dots was confirmed by costaining the cells with a dye specific for DNA ( data not shown ) .
Specificity of LYSP100 staining was demonstrated in two ways .
First , the characteristic LYSP100 nuclear dots were found only in LYSP100-expressing cells ( MBBI1 , VDSO , and ARH77 ) , and not in cells that are negative for LYSP100 mRNA ( K562 and HeLa ) ( A.L.D. , data not shown ) .
As a second test of antibody specificity , HeLa cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector for LYSP100-B and then costained with the anti-LYSP 100 antibodies ( Fig 5A , green staining ) and with the 5E10 monoclonal anti-PML antibody ( Fig 5A , red staining ) .
Ten percent to 20 % of the cells showed a dot-like nuclear staining with anti-LYSP100 antibodies that was similar to the LYSP100 staining observed in MBBI1 lymphoblastoid cells .
Nuclear localization of LYSP100 dots was confirmed by Nomarski differential-interference contrast microscopy ( Fig 5B ) .
The remainder of the cells , which presumably did not incorporate DNA during the transfection , did not show this LYSP100 staining pattern .
These specificity studies demonstrate that although anti-LYSP100 antibodies detected minor cross-reacting protein species in all cell types by Western blot analy-sis , these cross-reacting proteins were not readily detectable in the immunofluorescence assay .
Furthermore , the HeLa transfection experiment demonstrates that LYSP 100 nuclear structures can be generated in nonlymphoid cells and thus do not require other lymphoid-specific proteins for their for-mation .
Surprisingly , in transfected HeLa cells , LYSP100 and PML staining patterns were largely nonoverlapping ( Fig 5A ) .
Similarly , the majority of LYSP100 and PML nuclear structures in MBBI1 and peripheral blood B cells were not coincident ( Fig 4C , F , I , and L ) .
In contrast , SP 100 and PML colocalized precisely in MBBI1 cells in nuclear structures with the characteristic appearance of PML NBs ( Fig 4M to O ) , confirming previous results .
We next tested whether the LYSP100 nuclear dots coincided with other previously described subnuclear domains .
LYSP100 immunofluorescent staining was entirely nonoverlapping with the nuclear speckles detected with antibodies to the splicing factor , SC35 , '' ° and the nuclear dots detected with antibodies to p80-coilin '' ( data not shown ) .
Thus , LYSP100 was localized to subnuclear structures that are distinguishable from PML NBs , interchromatin granules and interchromatin fibrils ( containing SC35 ) , and coiled bodies ( containing p80-coi-lin ) .
Interestingly , in approximately 5 % of the MBBI1 cells , PML dots and LYSP100 dots exactly coincided within a confocal optical slice ( Fig 4C and I ) .
In some cells , only one dot costained for LYSP100 and PML ( Fig 4C ) , whereas in other cells LYSP100 and PML coincided in more than one structure ( Fig 41 ) .
In some cells , the pattern of PML/ LYSP100 colocalization was also striking , in that the From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

At left is a binucleated transfected cell , and at right are several nontransfected cells .
( B ) Nomarski differential-interference contrast microscopy of the cells in A. LYSP100 immunofluorescence appeared to be surrounded by a ring of PML immunofluorescence ( Fig 41 ) .
Based on an analysis of a z-series of 20 confocal optical slices through this cell ( Fig 6 ) , PML appeared to form a shell around a central LYSP100 core .
This observation rules out the possibility that colocalization of LYSP100 and PML in these structures occurred simply by chance superimposition .
Next , the relationship of SP100 dots to LYSP1OO0 dots was judged by costaining with a polyclonal mouse anti-SP100 antibody and the polyclonal rabbit anti-LYSP100 antibody ( Fig 7 ) .
In most cells , SP100 and LYSP100 were detected in nuclear dots that did not overlap ( data not shown ) .
However , in some cells dot-like structures containing both SP100 and LYSP100 were detected , and often a single nucleus contained several such structures ( Fig 7 ) .
Approximately the same minor fraction of MBBI1 cells ( ~5 % ) showed LYSP100/SP100 colocalization as showed LYSP100/PML colocalization .
Thus , in a minority of cells , LYSP100 colocalized with PML or $ P100 .
In some images , the colocalization was reminiscent of PML NBs ( Fig 41 ) .
However , a more precise definition of LYSP100-associated nuclear structures required the higher resolution afforded by immuno-EM .
Immuno-EM characterization of LANDs .
- We used immuno-EM to visualize the ultrastructural morphology and subcellular localization of LYSP10O-associated structures .
After fixation and embedding of MBBI1 lymphoblastoid cells , thin sections were reacted with LYSP100 antibodies alone ( Fig 8 ) , with both LYSP100 and PML antibodies ( Fig 9 ) , or with both LYSP100 and SP100 antibodies ( data not shown ) .
LYSP100 antibodies were secondarily reacted with anti-rabbit IgG antibodies coupled to 10-nm gold particles , whereas PML or SP100 antibodies were detected with antibodies coupled to 15-nm gold particles .
LYSP100 antibodies decorated electron-dense structures that were round to irregular in shape .
These structures ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 um in diameter , and thus were smaller than PML NBs , which were 0.3 to 1.0 wm .
The electron density of LYSP100-associated structures was often uneven , and in many instances they appeared to have a central core that was more electron-dense ( Figs 8A and 9A ) .
Specificity of LYSP100 immunogold detection was checked in two ways .
First , the characteristic electron-dense structures were not observed when the gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG alone was used for detection .
Second , electron-dense structures detected by anti-LYSP100 antibodies were observed frequently in MBBI1 cells but only rarely in HeLa cells , as predicted by the preferential expression of LYSP100 in lymphoid cells .
LYSP100-associated structures and PML NBs were morphologically distinct in several respects .
First , LYSP100 structures often appeared more electron-dense than PML NBs ( Fig 9C and D , LYSP10O0 structures marked by big arrows-PML NBs marked by small arrows ) .
Second , LYSP100 was never detected in a ring-like electron-dense structure , which is a hallmark of PML NBs . ''
Third , the dot-like LYSP100 structures were uniformly decorated by LYSP100 antibodies ( Fig 8A to D ) , whereas PML tended to localize over the outer-ring structure of PML NBs ( Fig 9C and D ) .
LYSP100 therefore appears to be associated with a novel nuclear domain that is distinct from PML NBs and other well-characterized subnuclear structures .
We therefore propose to name these subnuclear domains `` LANDs , '' '' for LYSP100-associated nuclear domains .
In sections stained with both LYSP100 and PML antibodies , most LANDs were found to stain only with LYSP100 .
Furthermore , most PML staining was detected in typical PML NBs .
However , some LANDs were decorated with both 10-nm and 15-nm gold particles , indicating the presence of both L¥SP100 and PML , respectively ( Fig 9 ) .
These PML and LYSP100 costaining structures appeared to have the characteristics of LANDs , as already described , rather than the characteristics of PML NBs .
Indeed , LANDs that contained PML could not be readily distinguished by morphology from those that did not .
The ratio of LYSP100 to PML gold particles in the structures shown in Fig 9 is 2.0 + 0.49 .
The relatively low variation in this ratio points to a consistency in the molecular composition of the LANDs to which both LYSP100 and PML localize .
In contrast to LYSP100 , antibodies to SP100 stained characteristic PML NBs exclusively , and were not detected in structures with LAND morphology ( data not shown ) .
EM provided several intriguing refinements for the characterization of subcellular distribution of LANDs .
Most LANDs were observed within the nucleoplasm in the interchromatin space ( Figs 8A and 9A and D ) .
However , many LANDs were localized precisely at the nuclear envelope , sometimes on the nuclear face ( Fig 9C ) and in other cases on the cytoplasmic face ( Figs 8B and C and 9B ) .
Frequently , these LANDs were seen at the tip of deep invaginations of the nuclear envelope into the nucleus ( Figs 8B and 9B ) .
Approximately one fifth of the LANDs were observed in the cytoplasm and were morphologically indistinguishable from LANDs present in the nucleoplasm ( Fig 8D ) .
LANDs that contained PML showed a similar subcellular distribution compared with LANDs devoid of PML .
In summary , morphologically similar LANDs were observed in the nucleo- Fig 7 .

1432 plasm , at the nuclear membrane , and in the cytoplasm , raising the possibility that LANDs are transported between these compartments .
DISCUSSION We have cloned a novel lymphoid-restricted nuclear factor , LYSP100 , that is homologous to SP100 , a protein found in dot-like nuclear domains termed PML NBs .
As analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy , LYSP 100 was also localized in dot-like subnuclear structures , but , surprisingly , LYSP100 dots were generally nonoverlapping with PML NBs .
By immuno-EM , LYSP100 was found in novel electron-dense globular structures that were morphologically distinct from PML NBs and other previously described subnuclear structures .
Thus , LYSP100 molecularly defines a novel subnuclear domain , which we term LAND , for LYSP100-associated nuclear domain .
Interestingly , in a minor population of LANDs , LYSP100 and PML did colocal-ize , as judged by immuno-EM .
Our data thus reveal LANDs as a new class of nuclear structures associated with PML .
LYSP100 and SP100 genes likely evolved from a common ancestor , since they encode proteins that share several regions of homology .
All LYSP100 and SP100 isoforms share a highly conserved 157-amino acid amino-terminal domain .
In addition , one isoform of LYSP100 , LYSP100-B , contains a carboxy-terminal extension of 470 amino acids that bears homology with HNPP , a nuclear phosphoprotein that is strongly induced following interferon treatment of cells . ''
We used this LYSP10O0 isoform to identify a previously undescribed SP100 isoform , SP100-B , which also contains a carboxy-terminal HNPP domain .
A common feature of S $ P100 , HNPP , and PML is that they are strongly upregulated by interferon treatment of cells .
*** '' By contrast , interferon treatment has only a modest ( ~twofold ) effect on LYSP100 mRNA expression ( A.L .
Dent , unpublished observations , September 1993 ) .
Of particular note , LYSP100-B shares two homology regions with several transcriptional regulatory proteins , the PHD/TTC domain and the bromodomain .
The PHD/TTC domain is defined by a characteristic arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues , C , HC ; , '' °* and is a potential zinc-coordination motif . ''
Two PHD/TTC domain proteins , CBP and p300 , mediate transcriptional activation through the cAMP-responsive transcription factor , CREB . ''
The PHD/ TTC motif is also repeated four times in the Drosophila homeotic protein , trithorax , a positive regulator of transcription that is responsible for maintenance of the transcription of homeotic selector genes . ''
The MLL gene , a trithorax homologue translocated in a variety of human leukemias , '' '' '' * has particularly high sequence homology with trithorax in the PHD/TTC region .
The closest homologue to LYSP100-B in the PHD/TTC domain is TIF1 , a potential coactivator protein for nuclear hormone receptors . ''
TIFI binds to the AF-2 activation domains of nuclear hormone receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion and can stimulate transcription through these receptors in yeast . ''
Interestingly , TIF-1 displays a more extended homology with LYSP100-B that includes the bromodomain and the spacer region between the two domains , suggesting DENT ET AL that these two domains perform related functions in the two proteins .
In addition to TIF1 , the coactivator proteins , CBP and p300 , also contain both a bromodomain and a PHD/ TTC domain .
The bromodomain is also found in CCGI1I/ hTAFH250 , '' *°° a protein that is tightly associated with TATA binding factor and is required for the function of certain transcriptional activation domains . ''
A large , functionally distinct class of bromodomain proteins are homo-logues of the Drosophila homeotic protein , Brahma , and the yeast SWI2/SNF2 protein , and appear to contribute to a multiprotein complex that disrupts chromatin .
`` * Although the precise function of the bromodomain is not yet clear , deletion of this domain in the yeast transcriptional adaptor protein , impairs its ability to activate transcription mediated by certain activation domains . ''
These sequence homologies provide provocative , albeit preliminary , indications that LYSP100 may participate in transcriptional regulation .
The lymphoid-restricted expression of LYSP100 further suggests that LYSP100 does not perform a merely `` housekeeping '' function , but instead may act to regulate transcription in a cell type-specific fashion .
LANDs were distinct in location and morphology from other subnuclear structures that have been molecularly de-fined , including interchromatin granules , perichromatin fibrils , coiled bodies , and PML NBs .
EM showed LANDs to be round or irregularly shaped electron-dense structures ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.3 wm .
Three-dimensional confocal image plane reconstruction of LANDs showed them to be solid , roughly spherical structures ( A.L.D. , J. Y. , and L.M.S. , unpublished data , March 1994 ) .
Thus , the morphology of LANDs as revealed by immunofluorescence or EM is not notably distinctive , and consequently , this novel nuclear sub-domain could not have been appreciated without the cloning and characterization of LYSP1OO0 .
At present , since LYSP100 is a lymphoid-restricted protein , it is not possible to convincingly demonstrate that LANDs exist in nonlymphoid cells .
However , in this regard , it is noteworthy that when LYSP100-B was expressed in HeLa cells by transfection , LYSP100 antibodies detected dot-like nuclear structures by immunofluorescence that were indistinguishable from LANDs detected in lymphoid cells .
One interpretation of this result is that the ectopically expressed LYSP100 was incorporated into LAND-like structures that preexisted in HeLa cells Alternatively but seemingly less likely , LYSP100 might organize de novo LANDs within HeLa cells .
The ultrastructural location of LANDs may provide some intimation of their function .
The greatest number of LANDs was observed in the nucleoplasm , where they could be detected in the interchromatin regions ( Figs 7 and 8 ) and in the nucleolar regions ( data not shown ) .
However , in addition , many LANDs were directly touching the nuclear envelope , both on the nuclear and cytoplasmic face , and approximately one fifth of the LANDs were in the cytoplasm proper .
In-triguingly , LANDs were frequently observed at the tip of deep invaginations of the nuclear membrane ( Figs 7B and 8B ) .
It is unclear how such invaginations in the nuclear envelope are formed and maintained , but they could conceivably represent functional specializations of the nuclear enve- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

These observations suggest the possibility that LANDs may traverse the nucleus to the cytoplasm , or vice versa .
In the former case , LANDs might be multisubunit structures that , like ribosomes , are assembled in the nucleus but function in the cytoplasm .
Alternatively , LANDs might be directly involved in the transport of macromolecules such as RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm .
On the other hand , LANDs , like snRNPs , '' ° may be assembled in the cytoplasm and then imported into the nucleus .
Once in the nucleus , LANDs may serve as sites where specialized nuclear functions take place , or they may be storage areas for proteins that can be released from LANDs to function elsewhere in the nucleus .
Finally , our data provide evidence for the association of PML with a subnuclear structure other than the PML NB .
PML-containing LANDs were found in the nucleoplasm , at the nuclear membrane , and in the cytoplasm , and were morphologically indistinguishable from LANDs lacking PML .
Previously , PML has been localized by immunofluorescence to the cytoplasm of some cells , '' yet PML NBs have only been described by EM in the nucleo-plasm .
Therefore , some of the previously described cytoplasmic PML may be attributable to LANDs .
Furthermore , although the majority of PML in the nucleus is associated with PML NBs , some of the nuclear dots detected by immunofluorescence with anti-PML antibodies could represent LANDs .
Recent studies have demonstrated that PML can suppress the growth and malignant transformation of cells , '' '' and can repress the activity of certain promoters in transient transfection assays . ''
The present results suggest that LANDs should be taken into consideration in models of PML function .
One possibility raised by the presence of PML in both LANDs and PML NBs is that LANDs might be precursors in From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Conceivably , PML-containing LANDs might coalesce to generate the ring-like PML NBs .
In this regard , the confocal immunofluorescence image of LYSP100 surrounded by a ring of PML ( Fig 41 ) is especially intriguing .
Given the annular nature of PML NBs by EM , it seems possible that the ring-like structures in Fig 41 are unusually large PML NBs .
Thus , in a small percentage ( < 5 % ) of cells , LYSP100 may be located in PML NBs .
By immuno-EM , we were unable to detect LYSP 100 in characteristic PML NBs , but this failure may simply reflect the difficulty of detecting rare events by EM .
If LYSP100 is indeed present in a small subpopulation of PML NBs , it seems possible that LANDs are precursors to these structures .
