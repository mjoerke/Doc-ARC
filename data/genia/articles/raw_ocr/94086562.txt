Functional and Physical Interaction of Protein-tyrosine Kinases Fyn and Csk in the T-cell Signaling System* ( Received for publication , July 23 , 1993 ) Masakazu Takeuchi , Satomi Kuramochi , Noemi Fusaki , Shigeyuki Nadat # , Junko Kawamura-Tsuzuku , Satoru Matsuda , Kentaro Semba , Kumao Masato Okadat , and Tadashi Yamamoto1 From the Institute of Medical Science , The University of Tokyo , 4-6-1 Shirokanedai , Minato-ku , Tokyo 108 , Japan and the { Institute for Protein Research and §Research Institute for Microbial Diseases , Osaka University , Yamadaoka , Suita , Osaka 565 , Japan The Src-like protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn is associated with T-cell antigen receptor .
Transient expression of actively mutated Fyn , having Phe-528 instead of Tyr-528 or Thr-338 instead of Ie-338 , in Jurkat T-cells stimulated the serum response element ( SRE ) , 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-18-acetate response element , cyclic AMP response element , and c-fos promoter .
The stimulation of SRE was particularly prominent not only with active Fyn but also with normal ( wild-type ) Fyn .
SRE was also stimulated by both normal and active Lock .
Furthermore , normal and active Fyn stimulated transcription from the IL-2 gene promoter when transfected cells were stimulated by concanavalin A plus 12-O-tetradecanoy } -phorbol-13-acetate .
Under the same conditions , Lok did not stimulate IL-2 promoter unless it was activated by mutation .
Interestingly , a mutant Fyn , which has deletions within the SH2 region and so is able to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts , did not stimulate either the c-fos or IL-2 promoter , suggesting the importance of this region in T-cell signaling .
Csk , which phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory sites of Sre family kinases , down-regulated Fyn- and Lek-mediated stimulation of the serum response element and Fyn-mediated enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity .
These data suggest that Fyn and Lock , whose activities are regulated by Csk , are involved in different phases of T-cell activation .
The Sre-like kinases are generally associated with the internal portion of the plasma membrane and are suggested to play crucial roles in surface receptor-mediated signaling ( 1-8 ) .
Since the enzymatic activities of Src-like kinases are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their carboxy-terminal regions ( 1 , 2 ) , it is important to identify the enzymes responsible for these activities .
Recently an enzyme that phosphorylates a tyrosine residue close to the car-boxyl terminus of c-Src , tyrosine 527 , was purified from the membrane fraction of neonatal rat brain and named Csk ( 9 ) .
Csk can also phosphorylate other members of the Src family such as Fyn and Lyn at the conserved tyrosine residue within the carboxyl-terminal region .
Consequently , Csk down-regu-lates the kinase activities of Src , Fyn , and Lyn in vitro ( 10 ) and suppresses cell transformation by a combination of c-Sre and Crk ( 11 ) .
Recent evidence also shows that Csk is able to rescue the c-Src-induced lethal phenotype of Saccharomyces pombe , presumably by regulating kinase activity of the c-Sre protein ( 12 ) .
Csk is expressed in lymphoid tissues and in neonatal brain ( 10 ) , which is rich in Sre family kinases ( 1 , 2 , 13 ) .
There-fore , Csk may negatively regulate the functions of these Src-like kinases in lymphoid and neural cells .
The response of T-cells to antigen bound to the antigen receptor ( T-cell receptor ( TCR ) ' ) -major histocompatibility complex consists of a series of cellular events that result in expression of a number of genes including the c-fos and IL-2 genes ( 14 ) .
There are reports that activation of protein-tyrosine kinases following TCR stimulation is required and precede these intracellular events ( 15 ) .
In most cases TCR consists of an aB heterodimer and CD3 subunits that are y , 8 , e , and { ( and/or 1 ) chains .
However , none of these molecules possesses intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity .
Recent evidence suggests that Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases couple the TCR for the signaling events ( 15 ) .
In particular , the Fyn protein , which is expressed in mature T-cells , physically associates with the CD3 complex ( 16 ) .
The importance of Fyn in TCR-mediated signal transduction is further suggested by the following studies .
By use of a transgenic mice system , thymocytes expressing a high level of the fyn transgene were shown to be hyperstimulatable ( 17 ) .
Studies using fyn~ mice revealed that TCR-mediated signaling was defective in mature single positive ( CD4*CDS8~ or CD4-CD8+* ) thymocytes , although the signaling was still present in immature thymocytes and peripheral T-cells ( 18 , 20 ) .
The latter data suggest that fyn is critically important in TCR-mediated signaling , at least in a developmentally restricted subpopulation of thymocytes .
In addition , our unpublished data suggest that IL-2 production is elevated in T-cell hybridomas expressing high levels of wild-type and actively mutated Fyns upon mitogenic stimulation . ''
To obtain further details of the molecular mechanisms of T-cell signaling , we have examined the effects of Fyn and Csk expression on the activities of the c-fos and IL-2 promoters .

Construction of Expression Plasmids-The expression vector pME18SM containing SRa promoter ( 20 ) was a gift from K. Maruyama ( Tokyo University ) .
The complementary DNAs encoding T-Fyn were obtained by the following modifications of pSRD-FN ( 21 ) , which contained 1.8-kilobase pair B-fyn cDNA .
A sequence corresponding to exon 7A ( 22 ) specific to brain type Fyn was replaced by that corresponding to exon 7B ( 22 ) , which was synthesized by reverse transcription of mRNA from Jurkat T-cells followed by polymerase chain reaction ( 23 ) , The primers used for polymerase chain reaction were 5-CCACCCGGGC-CAAGCTTGAAACACTTC-3 ' and 5-GCCTGGTTTAAGAAGCTTTAT GGCTAC-3 ' , corresponding to the sense sequence at the 3 ' end of exon 6 and the antisense sequence at the 5 ' end of exon 8 , respectively .
These primers contained HindIII sites , which were created by introducing point mutations ( shown above in boldface letters ) in the authentic sequence of fyn cDNA .
The boundaries of the exons were deduced from those of the c-src gene ( 24 ) .
The amplified DNA fragments for exon 7 were cleaved by Hindlll and cloned in pUC119 .
The nucleotide sequence of exon 7B was determined by the standard dideoxy chain termination method .
The deduced amino acid sequence of exon 7B was compared with that of exon 7A ( Fig .
1B ) .
The T-fyn cDNA as well as B-fyn , t-lfyn , and f-14fyn cDNAs were excised from pSRD vector ( 21 ) and recloned into pME18SM at the Miul site .
The DNA fragments of the Ick cDNA ( 25 ) obtained from T. Shimotohno ( National Cancer Center , Tokyo ) , the lyn cDNA ( 13 ) , and the csk cDNA ( 26 ) were converted to the Miul fragments by attaching the Miul linker ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , which were then recloned into the Miul site of pME18SM .
Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at amino acid positions 505 of Lek , 508 of Lyn , and 528 and 531 of T-FynF and B-FynF , respectively , were introduced by the method of Kunkel ( 27 ) .
The modified sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing .
The reporter plasmids containing bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) , TRECAT , SRECAT , CRECAT , and c-fos CAT ( 28 ) were from K. Kaibuchi ( Kobe University , Japan ) .
The IL-2 CAT plasmid ( 29 ) was from T. Taniguchi ( Osaka University ) .
pBact-Bgal plasmid , in which the -actin promoter was placed upstream of the B-galactosidase gene , was from S. Ishii ( RIKEN , Japan ) .
Transfection Assay for CAT-Eiffector plasmid DNAs were transfected into Jurkat T-cells together with the reporter plasmid and pBact-Bgal by the DEAE-dextran method as described ( 29 ) .
The transfected cells were incubated with or without ConA ( 30 ug/ml ) and TPA ( 50 ng/ml ) for 8 h before cell harvest .
Cells were then harvested at 48 h after transfection , washed , and lysed as described ( 30 ) .
The lysates ( 80 ug of protein ) were forwarded to CAT assay as described ( 30 , 31 ) .
CAT activities of the reaction products were quantitated with a Fujix Bio-Image Analyzer BAS 2000 ( Fuji Film , Tokyo ) .
The transfection efficiency was monitored by measuring the -galactosidase activity of the cell lysates .

Proteins ( 50 ug ) in the lysates were separated by 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Immobilon-P filters ( Millipore ) , which were subsequently probed with anti-Fyn antibody ( 32 ) or anti-Csk antibody as described ( 33 ) .
Co-immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay-All procedures were essentially as described ( 7 ) with slight modification .
Briefly , the cells were lysed with TNE buffer ( 50 mm Tris : HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 20 mx EDTA , 0.2 my sodium orthovanadate , and 10 pg/ml ] aprotinin } .
The lysates were incubated with anti-Fyn or anti-Csk antibodies at 4 °C for 1.5 b , and the immune complexes were precipitated with protein-G Sepharose ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. ) .
The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer ( 20 my Hepes NaOH ( pH 7.4 ) , 10 mx MgCl , , and 1 um ATP ) with 37 kBq of [ y-*°P ] JATP at 25 °C for 20 min .
The reaction products were analyzed on 8.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

RESULTS Stimulation of c-fos Promoter and IL-2 Promoter Activities by Kinase-active Fyn-The cDNA of active T-fyn ( T-FynF , Fig .
1 ) that encodes thymus-type Fyn ( 22 ) with Phe-528 instead of Tyr-528 was cloned into the expression plasmid pME18SM containing a chimeric promoter ( SRe ) of the SV40 and human T lymphotropic virus-l promoters ( 20 ) .
Reporter plasmid c-fos CAT ( 28 ) was cotransfected with the T-fynF expression plasmids into Jurkat T-cells , which were chosen because of the similarity of their response to TCR stimulation to that of normal resting T-cells ( 34 ) .
Transfection of T-fynF significantly increased the c-fos promoter activity ( Table 1 ) .
Since the c-fos promoter contains the serum response element ( SRE ) , the TPA response element ( TRE ) , and the cyclic AMP response element ( CRE ) ( 35 ) , we examined which element was responsible for the T-fynF-mediated stimulation of the c-fos promoter .
For this , we transfected the T-fynF construct into Jurkat cells together with the SRECAT , TRECAT , or CRECAT reporter plasmid ( 28 ) .
Results showed that T-FynF stimulated these elements and the stimulation of SRE was more than those of TRE and CRE ( Fig .
Regulation of T-cell Signaling by Protein-tyrosine Kinases 27415 Tasie I Stimulation of fos and IL-2 promoters by Fyn Various Fyn cDNA constructs ( 5 ug ) in pME18SM vector were transfected into Jurkat T-cells ( 2 x 10° ) together with reporter plasmids , c-fos CAT ( Fos ) , SRECAT ( SRE ) , TRECAT ( TRE ) , CRECAT ( CRE ) , or IL-2 CAT ( 5 ug ) as described ( 28 , 29 ) .
The lysates ( 80 ug of protein ) of the transfectants were subjected to CAT assay as described ( 30 , 31 ) .
The transfectants of IL-2CAT were treated with ConA ( 30 ug/ml ) and TPA ( 50 ng/m ! )
for 8 h ( ConA + TPA ) before cell harvest .
Relative CAT activitiees of Fyn transfectants in comparison with mock ( vector ) transfectants are presented .

2A , Table I ) .
These data suggested that the c-fos promoter was activated by T-FynF primarily through SRE .
In contrast , Jurkat cells transfected with T-fyrF showed little activation of CAT activity of IL-2 CAT over the cells cotransfected with the vector plasmid ( Table I ) .
This result indicates that elevated tyrosine kinase activity alone is not sufficient for induction of the IL-2 gene .
However , when T-cells cotransfected with IL-2 CAT and the T-fynF constructs were stimulated simultaneously by TPA and a mitogen such as ConA or phytohemagglutinin , elevated kinase activity of T-FynF markedly stimulated the IL-2 promoter ( Table I ) .
In this system , the phorbol ester TPA provided a second signal that is required for TCR-mediated mitogenesis .
Next , we cross-linked the CD3 molecule with anti-CD3e antibodies on the surface of the Jurkat T-cells that had been transfected with the IL-2 CAT and T-fyrF constructs .
On TPA treatment , CD3 cross-linking induced significant transactivation of the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
3 ) .
Treatment with TPA and anti-CD3e without exogenous T-fyrF had little effect .
Thus we concluded that increased kinase activity of Fyn augments transcription of the IL2 gene upon T-cell activation .
Effects of Normal Fyn , Lock , and Lyn on SRE and IL-2 Pro-moter-Previous reports show that active forms of other Sre family members , namely F505 p56 '' ** ( 36 ) and v-Src ( 37 ) , enhance T-cell responsiveness .
As p56 '' ** is abundantly expressed in T-cells and can contribute to T-cell signaling ( 3-5 , 38 ) , it is important to clarify whether Fyn and Lok regulate the signaling through similar or different mechanisms .
Then we examined the effects of normal Fyn and normal Lck on SRE and the IL-2 promoter .
For comparison , the effect of the lyn gene prod-uct , which is not expressed in normal T-cells , was also tested .
Two forms of normal fyn cDNAs , T-fyn and B-fyn ( Fig .
1 ) ( 22 ) , transfected into Jurkat cells stimulated SRECAT and caused stimulation of the IL-2 promoter only when the transfectants were stimulated with TPA plus ConA ( Table I ) .
No significant difference was observed between T-fyn and B-fyn .
SRE was also stimulated by normal and active F505Lck ( Table II ) .
Furthermore , as c-fos CAT was transactivated by Lck to a similar extent as by Fyn ( Fig .
2B ) , we tentatively concluded that the c-fos gene is also regulated by Lek most likely through SRE on T-cell activation .
Active Lyn ( F508Lyn ) also stimulated SRE , while normal Lyn had only a slight effect ( Table II ) .
These findings were substantiated by the observation that introduction of increasing amounts of the fyn and Ick constructs , but not the lyn construct , stimulated SRE dose dependently ( Fig .
44 ) .
In contrast , we found that neither normal Lek nor Lyn activated the IL-2 promoter in the presence or absence of ConA plus TPA stimulation ( Table II ) .

Stimulation of c-fos promoter and SRE by Fyn and Lek .
A , effect of T-FynF .
The expression plasmids pME18SM ( 5 ug/reaction ) with ( Zanes 5-8 ) or without ( lanes 1-4 ) T-fynF cDNA were transfected into Jurkat T-cells ( 2 x 10° ) together with reporter plasmids ( 5 ug each ) , c-fos CAT ( lanes 1 and 5 ) , TRECAT ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , CRECAT ( lanes 3 and 7 ) , and SRECAT ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .
The lysates ( 80 ug of protein ) of the transfectants were subjected to CAT assay .
B , the expression plasmids pME18SM ( 5 pg/reaction ) containing cDNAs for normal T-Fyn ( lane 2 ) , mutant T-FynF ( lane 3 ) , normal Lok ( lane 4 ) , and mutant F505Lck ( lane 5 ) or no insert ( lane 1 ) were transfected into Jurkat T-cells ( 2 x 10° ) together with c-fos CAT ( 5 ug ) .
The lysates ( 80 ug of protein ) of the transfectants were subjected to CAT assay .
of the IL2 promoter by normal Lek or Lyn kinase remained low , while that by normal Fyn increased with an increase in the amount of fyn construct transfected ( Fig .
4B ) .
From these data , we conclude that Fyn is a key protein-tyrosine kinase involved in the process of T-cell activation .
It should be noted , however , that both active F505Lck ( LekF ) and F508Lyn ( LynF ) together with ConA plus TPA stimulated the IL-2 promoter ( Table II ) , though less significantly than Fyn .

Stimulation of IL-2 promoter upon cross-linking of CD3e .
The expression plasmids pME18SM ( 5 ug/reaction ) with ( shaded bars ) or without ( open bars ) T-fyrF cDNA were transfected into Jurkat T-cells ( 2 x 10° ) together with IL-2 CAT constructs ( 5 ug each ) .
The transfectants were treated with TPA ( 50 ng/ml ) and anti-CD3e antibodies ( 50 ng/ml , provided by T. Uchiyama , Kyoto University ) for 6 h before cell harvest as described ( 55 ) .
The lysates of these transfectants were subjected to CAT assay .
Tasue II Stimulation of SRE and IL-2 promoter by Lok and Lyn Both normal and active /ck or lyn cDNAs in pME18SM vector ( 5 ug ) were transfected into Jurkat T-cells ( 2 x 10° ) together with reporter plasmids , SRECAT ( SRE ) , or IL-2 CAT ( 5 ug ) as described in Table I .
The lysates ( 80 ug of protein ) of the transfectants were subjected to CAT assay , and the enhancer/promoter activities were shown as described in Table I.

Two mutants of B-fynr , f-14 and t-l1fyns , which we isolated before ( Fig .
1 ) , transform chicken embryo fibroblasts while normal fyn does not ( 21 ) .
The products of these mutant fyn genes were shown to have elevated protein-tyrosine kinase activities in vitro ( ( 21 ) summarized in Fig .
1 ) .
The mechanisms of activation seem to be different because the nature of the mutations in the genes are different from each other .
The £-14 mutant carries a point mutation resulting in Thr-338 instead of in the kinase domain .
The t-1 mutant carries deletions of 78 base pairs in the sequence encoding the Sre homology-2 ( SH2 ) region .
The product of £-14fyn stimulated the CAT activity of SRECAT , and the stimulation was greater than that by normal Fyn .
On the other hand , the t-1fyn did not transactivate SRE ( Table I ) .
The possibility that the expression level of t-1fyn was much lower than that of normal fyn or £-14fyn in transfected cells is unlikely for the following reasons .
First all the B-fyn constructs , the wild type , f-14 , and t-1 , directed almost the same level of Fyn expression when transfected into CV-1 cells ( Fig .
5A ) in which the level of en-dogenous Fyn is low .
Second , Jurkat cells transfected with the SH2 deletion mutant t-1 expressed a significant amount of the exogenous Fyn protein as determined by immune complex kinase assay ( Fig .
5B ) .
Third , even when the increased amounts of the t-1fyn construct were cotransfected , the CAT activity of SRECAT remained at low levels ( Fig .
44 ) .
Thus , the SH2 region seems important in Fyn-mediated transactivation of SRE .
Similarly the CAT activity of IL-2 CAT was stimulated by f-14 Fyn but not by t-1Fyn ( Table I ) in Jurkat cells treated by ConA Regulation of T-cell Signaling by Protein-tyrosine Kinases A 3 - @ - T-fyn > -a- lyn _ aA E - # - Ick l g -O- t-1 fyn < 0 2 Fa < U ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... o 00 | - wen '' 3 l 1 `` C P4 0 7T % } } Fm ; ° ' 8 10 Expression Plasmid 9 B s +T-fyn 3 4 -~ # lyn B - @ - lek < t 3 < J o 2 a 3 & a i .

Differential effects of Src-like kinases on SRE and IL-2 promoter .
Increasing amounts of the cDNAs for T-Fyn , Lek ( 25 ) , and Lyn ( 13 ) cloned in pME18SM ( 1-9 ug ) were transfected into Jurkat cells ( 5 x 108 cells ) together with SRECAT ( 3 ug ) ( A ) or with IL-2 CAT ( 3 ug ) ( B ) .
In B , transfectants were treated with ConA and TPA as described in Table I .
The lysates of these transfectants were subjected to CAT assay .
In A , the effect of t-1Fyn was also analyzed by transfecting its cDNA in pME18SM .
Three independent experiments gave virtually identical results .
The percentage conversions of [ **C ) chloramphenicol to its acetylated form with 1 ug of expression plasmids of fyn , ick , and lyn , respectively , in a particular experiment were , respectively , 0.7 , 0.6 , and 0.9 in A and 0.45 , 0.2 , and 0.3 in B .
The data with t-lfyn ( A ) were obtained with a different set of experiments , and the percentage conversion with 1 ug of DNA was 0.66 .

Transient expression of t-1fyn in fibroblasts and T-cells .
Expression plasmids pME18SM containing cDNAs for normal B-fyr ( lanes A4 and B4 ) , f-14fyn ( lanes A3 and B3 ) , and t-1fyn ( lanes A2 and B2 ) or no insert ( lanes A1 and B1 ) were transfected into CV-1 cells ( A ) and Jurkat T-cells ( B ) .
The transfectants were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed with RIPA buffer , and the lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis ( A ) or to immune complex kinase assay ( B ) using anti-Fyn antibodies .
The position of Fyn is indicated on the right .
Only a slight difference of migration between t-1Fyn and normal or £-14Fyn is acknowledged in B , since the kinase reaction products were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing a relatively higher concentration ( 12 % ) of polyacrylamide .
plus TPA .
These findings suggest that Fyn kinase enhances signaling into the nucleus and further that the SH2 domain of Fyn is involved in this enhancement .
Functional and Physical Interactions of Fyn with Csk in TCR-mediated Signaling-To determine the effects of Csk on transactivation of c-fos and IL-2 promoters by Src-like kinases , we inserted csk cDNA ( 26 ) in the correct and reverse orienta- Regulation of T-cell Signaling by Protein-tyrosine Kinases 1° 2 34 56 78 310 A 7 % Acetylation % Acetylation vector T-Fyn T-FynF Fic .

Interaction of Csk with Fyn and Lek .
Samples of 3 ug of the expression plasmid pMECsk ( sense ; + , shaded bars ) or pMEKsc ( antisense ; - , solid bars ) were transfected into Jurkat T-cells ( 5 x 10° ) together with the expression plasmids ( 3 ug ) for normal T-Fyn ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , normal Lok ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , activated T-FynF ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , or activated LckF ( lanes 9 and 10 ) and SRECAT ( A ) or IL-2 CAT ( B ) reporter plasmid ( 3 ug ) .
When the IL-2 CAT construct was used as a reporter plasmid , the transfectants were treated with ConA and TPA as described in Table I .
The pMECsk ( Zane 1 ) or pMEKsc ( lane 2 ) plasmid ( 3 ug ) was transfected with the reporter plasmids ( 3 ug ) and pME18SM vector plasmid without fyr cDNA ( 3 ug ) .
At least two independent experiments gave essentially identical results .
It should be noted that the data with antisense csk cDNA in this experiment were consistent with those given in Tables I and II except that the level of stimulation of SRE by LckF was relatively lower than that by Lok .
Probably this could be attributed to the poorer quality of the LckF plasmid that we prepared for this particular experiment .
tions under the SRa « promoter and transfected the resulting constructs into Jurkat cells together with the reporter CAT constructs and the fyn or Ick expression construct .
Expression of sense csk cDNA suppressed normal Fyn- or Lek-mediated stimulation of SRE , while expression of antisense csk cDNA had virtually no effect on SRE stimulation by Lek and Fyn ( Fig .
6A ) .
As expected , SRE stimulation by the active forms of these kinases with tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites ( T-FynF and LckF ) was barely affected by Csk .
Transactivation of the IL-2 promoter by normal Fyn was also suppressed by Csk ( Fig .
6B ) .
Again T-FynF-mediated transactivation of the promoter was little affected by Csk .
These results suggested that Csk is involved in TCR-mediated signaling by regulating the kinase activities of Fyn and Lek to stimulate the c-fos and/or IL-2 promoters .
Then the possibility that Csk physically interacts with Fyn was ex 27417 A 10 2 o : 40 506 kDa 200 - f 97.4 69.0 - w * -- < < 46.0 - C * $ i < Fic .

Co-immunoprecipitation of Fyn with Csk .
The HBC21.7.31 cells and their derivatives ( 10° ) that express normal B-Fyn ( lanes 2 and 5 ) and £-14Fyn ( lanes 3 and 6 ) exogenously were lysed with TNE buffer .
The lysates were subjected to immune complex kinase assay using normal rabbit serum ( lanes 1-3 ) or anti-Csk antibodies ( lanes 4-6 ) .
The Fyn protein was then re-immunoprecipitated from the reaction products ( A ) .
Aliquots of the lysates were subjected to Western blotting to examine the amount of Fyn ( B ) and Csk ( C ) expressed in each cell line .
The positions of Fyn and Csk are indicated on the right by arrows .
amined using the T-cell hybridomas HBC21.7.31 in which normal or f-14fyn was exogenously introduced . ''
From lysates of both normal fyn and £-14fyn overexpressed cells , we could co-immunoprecipitate Fyn with Csk using anti-Csk antibodies , which was demonstrated by in vitro kinase reaction ( Fig .
7 ) .
The amount of Fyn co-immunoprecipitated with Csk was apparently dependent on the level of Fyn expression ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
More phosphorylation of f-14Fyn as compared with normal Fyn was detected in the Csk immunoprecipitates ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
This may suggest that £-14Fyn that is supposed to be highly autophosphorylated at Tyr-420 in vivo forms a stabler complex with Csk than normal Fyn .
The associated Csk would phosphorylate Fyn in vitro .
It is also possible that both forms of Fyn equally associate with Fyn and the levels of phosphorylation merely reflect the in vitro kinase activities of £-14Fyn and normal Fyn .
Our experimental data do not discriminate these two possibilities .
It is important to examine whether phosphorylation in vitro ( lanes 5 and 6 ) occurred on Tyr-420 or on Tyr-531 in order to further analyze the mechanism of association .
Nonetheless our data at least demonstrate physical association of Fyn with Csk , which suggests that Csk is involved in TCR-mediated signaling .
DISCUSSION Using a transient expression system we have shown that Fyn kinase activated by a point mutation , Tyr-528 - > Phe , confers hyperresponsiveness on T-cells .
The T-cell responsiveness was determined by measuring stimulation of the promoter activities of both the c-fos and IL-2 genes .
Our evidence suggests that the c-fos promoter is stimulated by T-FynF through enhancement of SRE and TRE within the promoter ( Fig .
24 , Table I ) .
The IL-2 promoter activity was augmented by T-FynF only when the cells received mitogenic stimulation that mimics TCR-mediated activation ( Table I ) .
This suggests that the elevated kinase activity alone is not sufficient to deliver the signal toward the nucleus .
It is likely that T-cell specific signaling through Fyn may require its dimerization , as the signaling of the receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinase occurs via 27418 dimerization of the receptor ( 39 ) .
Since Fyn interacts with TCR complex , ligand-dependent clustering of TCR would result in Fyn dimerization .
Similar , though less , stimulation of these promoters was observed by overexpressing normal Fyn ( Table 1 ) .
In addition , kinase-active Fyn having a deletion in the SH2 region could hardly stimulate SRE or affect the promoter activity of the IL-2 gene in response to activating signal ( Table I , see below ) .
From these data we have concluded that Fyn plays an important role in delivering signal from TCR to nucleus .
In addition we would like to point out that the experimental system employed in this study is useful to analyze the molecular basis of Fyn function in T-cell activation .
Namely , it is possible to coexpress possible regulatory proteins such as protein tyrosine kinase Csk and protein tyrosine phosphatases together with Fyn in Jurkat cells and examine the activities of c-fos and IL-2 promoters in T-cell signaling ( see below ) .
The suggestion of functional involvement of Fyn in TCR signal transduction is provided by previous studies .
First , a rapid but transient increase in Fyn kinase activity followed TCR stimulation ( 40 ) .
Second , overexpression of Fyn in T-cell hybridomas ( Ref .
41 and our unpublished data ? )
or in thymocytes of transgenic mice ( 17 ) resulted in augmented responses to TCR stimulation .
Finally TCR-mediated signaling was defective in mature thymocytes of Fyn-deficient mice , although the signaling was unaffected in immature thymocytes and peripheral T-cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
The conclusion of this manuscript is consistent with these observations .
Previous studies have shown that another Src-like kinase Leck that is primarily expressed in T-cells is also important in the process of T-cell activation .
For example , a failure to express functional Lok was unable to activate the TCR-regulated pathway of the protein tyrosine kinase ( 42 ) .
Consistently SRE and the c-fos promoter were stimulated by Lek as well as T-Fyn ( Table II , Fig .
2 ) .
However , we also demonstrated that normal Lek , unlike normal Fyn , was unable to stimulate transcription of the IL-2 gene upon T-cell activation ( Table II , Fig .
4B ) , suggesting that Lok and Fyn play roles in different phases of signaling .
We propose that Fyn functions more proximal to the IL-2 gene than Lok .
The experimental data in this study also show that at least part of the SH2 region of Fyn is important in Fyn-mediated signaling in T-cells ( Table I , Fig .
44 ) .
Many lines of evidence show that SH2-containing proteins are important in signal transduction ( 43-45 ) .
These proteins include a phosphatidyli-nositol-specific phospholipase C-y , the ras GTPase-activating protein , the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and Grb-2/Sem5 , which have been demonstrated to be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues and/or associated with receptor protein-tyrosine kinases upon ligand stimulation .
In a preliminary study , we found that the CD3 { chain was associated with the Fyn protein when these proteins were expressed together in CV-1 cells ( data not shown ) .
Others also showed physical interaction between Fyn and the { chain and demonstrated that the 10-amino acid sequence in the amino-terminal unique domain was responsible for the association ( 46 ) .
The critical role of the { chain , which has multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites ( 47 ) , in signal transduction was clearly demonstrated by analyzing a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain of CD4 or CD8 and the cytoplasmic domain of { ( 48-50 ) .
Taken together we assume that the SH2 sequence of Fyn interacts with the partly phosphorylated { chain and that this interaction increases the stability of Fyn-£ association and is a prerequisite for further tyrosine phosphorylation of { by the Fyn kinase .
The resulting , heavily phosphorylated { chain would in turn recruit SH2-containing signaling molecules such as phospholipase C-4 , GTPase-activating protein , and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , as insulin receptor-associated p185 , which becomes phospho- Regulation of T-cell Signaling by Protein-tyrosine Kinases rylated at multiple tyrosine residues by the insulin receptor upon insulin stimulation , interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 51 ) .
It should be noted that ZAP-70 protein-tyrosine kinase , which was identified as { -associated kinase , contains two SHZ2 motives and is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation of T-cells ( 52 , 53 ) .
In addition , our present data suggest that at least some fraction of Csk is associated with TCR .
Csk might be recruited by phosphorylated { to complete negative regulation of Fyn and/or Lock kinases , resulting in down-regulation of signaling .
The kinase activity of the Src family is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a tyrosine residue that corresponds to Tyr-527 of c-Sre and is conserved among the family members ( 1 , 2 ) .
Phosphorylation of this regulatory tyrosine is catalyzed by a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase Csk ( 9 ) .
Regulation of the Sre kinase activity by Csk has been demonstrated in vitro and in yeast ( 10 , 12 , 26 ) .
Although the kinase activity of Fyn has been shown to be down-regulated in vitro by Csk ( 10 ) , regulation of Fyn kinase by Csk in intact cells has not been demonstrated .
Our present data clearly show that Csk suppresses activities of Fyn and Lek to stimulate the c-fos and IL-2 promoters in T-cells ( Fig .
6 ) , which suggests that Csk is involved in TCR-mediated signaling .
Furthermore we demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of ( sk and Fyn from the lysates of Fyn-overexpressed cells by means of in vitro kinase assay ( Fig .
7 ) .
The efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation was low , and preliminary data indicated that no more than 1 % of Fyn was physically associated in unstimulated cells .
The molecular basis of this interaction remains to be elucidated .
It should be noted , however , that no association of Csk with Sre was observed in fibroblasts ( 54 ) .
Nevertheless recent studies in this laboratory suggested physical interaction of Lyn and Fyn with Csk when both kinases were overexpressed in CV-1 monkey kidney cells . ''
Further studies are needed to explain the apparent discrepancy .
Both Fyn and Lek are associated with the antigen-major histocompatibility complex receptor system ( 3 , 4 , 6 ) .
Moreover Csk is expressed ubiquitously but is expressed at highest levels in certain tissues that include thymus ( 10 ) and has been isolated from the cellular membrane fraction ( 9 ) .
These data together suggest that Csk functions in the TCR-CD3-mediated signaling pathway .
