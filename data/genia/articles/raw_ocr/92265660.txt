This induction of differentiation is accompanied by adherence and loss of proliferation , as well as expression/repression of differentiation-associated genes .
Long term culture of TPA-differentiated U-937 cells in the absence of phorbol ester for 32-36 days resulted in a process of retrodifferentiation .
The retrodifferentiated cells detached from the substrate and reinitiated proliferation .
Other cellular parameters , such as glycosidase activities , cytokine release , and filament expression , returned to levels similar to that observed in uninduced cells .
Treatment of U-937 cells with TPA resulted in a rapid translocation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) from the cytosol to cell membrane fractions within 2-8 min .
Increased levels of membrane-associated PKC activity persisted until 17-29 days .
However , longer periods of incubation were associated with a return to the distribution of PKC in control cells .
Activation of PKC has been implicated in the regulation of certain immediate early response genes , and in the present studies , TPA rapidly induced c-fos and c-jun gene expression .
Levels of c-fos and c-jun transcripts remained elevated during periods of PKC activation and also returned to levels observed in control cells by 30-36 days , when the cells entered retrodifferentiation .
Staurosporine , a nonspecific inhibitor of PKC , partially blocked TPA-induced adherence and growth inhibition and concomitantly prevented TPA-induced c-fos and c-jun gene expression .
These findings thus suggest that PKC activation is involved in both regulation of early response gene expression and controlling the state of Received 3/29/91 .

Introduction Human myeloid leukemia cells ( HL-60 , U-937 ) differentiate along the monocytic lineage following exposure to phorbol esters such as TPA ( 1 , 2 ) .
The differentiated monocytic phenotype is characterized by growth inhibi-tion , adherence , loss of cell surface transferrin receptors , induction of a-naphthyl acetate esterase staining , and increases in monocyte surface markers ( 3 ) .
TPA-induced differentiation of some myeloid leukemia cell lines is also associated with down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb gene expression , as well as induction of the c-fos and c-jun immediate early response genes ( 4-6 ) .
Although these genes code for cell nucleus-associated products , TPA-induced differentiation is also associated with subsequent increases in the expression of products involved in the regulation and function of monocytes .
For exam-ple , TPA increases levels of transcripts coding for the monocyte colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF , CSF-1 ) , the monocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor ( c-fms gene product ) , and tumor necrosis factor ( 7 , 8 ) .
Thus , TPA-induced appearance of the monocytic phenotype is associated with changes in the expression of both early and later response genes .
TPA activates calcium- and phospholipid-dependent PKC ( 9 , 10 ) .
However , the role of this enzyme in regulating events associated with monocytic differentiation has remained unclear .
Bryostatin 1 , a macrocyclic lactone isolated from a marine bryozoan , also induces translocation of PKC and monocytic differentiation ( 6 ) .
Moreover , phospholipase C-mediated formation of diacylglyc-erol , the endogenous activator of PKC , is associated with transient induction of certain genes that are also induced during TPA treatment ( 11 ) .
Other studies have demonstrated that sphingoid bases and palmitoyl carnitine inhibit PKC activation and block TPA-induced differentiation ( 12 ) .
Taken together , these findings have supported the involvement of PKC in the induction of monocytic differentiation .
The effects of PKC activators on human myeloid leukemia cells have been examined in most studies at varying intervals through several days after induction of differentiation .
However , recent work has demonstrated that U-937 cells induced to differentiate by TPA revert back to the undifferentiated phenotype when cultured for periods of more than 30 days in the absence of this agent .
These findings are consistent with a process of * The abbreviations used are : TPA , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-ace-tate ; PKC , protein kinase C ; kb , kilobase ( s ) ; TNF-a , tumor necrosis factor a ; IL-18 , interleukin 18 ; PBS , phosphate-buffered saline ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate ; cDNA , complementary DNA .
542 PKC Activation in U-937 Differentiation and Retrodifferentiation retrodifferentiation characterized by apparent reversibil-ity of all parameters which have been altered during a previous differentiation event .
Thus , the properties of the retrodifferentiated cells were indistinguishable from untreated control cells ( 13 ) .
There are presently few insights available regarding the mechanisms responsible for this retrodifferentiation of TPA-treated U-937 cells .
Moreover , although PKC activation has been implicated in the induction of monocytic differentiation , the relationship between the activity of the enzyme and retrodifferentiation is unknown .
The present studies have examined activation of PKC during differentiation/retro-differentiation , as well as changes in phenotype and gene expression .
The results indicate a relationship between activation of PKC and c-fos/c-jun gene expression , suggesting a role for this enzyme in the maintenance and reversion of the differentiated monocytic phenotye .
Results Previous studies have demonstrated that TPA induces monocytic differentiation in U-937 cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
This induction is followed by a process of retrodifferentiation ( 13 ) .
TPA activates the Ca**- and phospholipid-dependent PKC by translocating the activity of this enzyme from the cytosol to cell membrane fractions ( 9 , 10 ) .
In order to determine whether differentiation/retrodifferentiation is related to these effects of TPA , we first studied activation of PKC in U-937 cells by this agent .
Approximately 90 % of the total PKC activity was detectable in the cytosol of U-937 cells .
In contrast , treatment with TPA was associated with translocation of this activity to the cell membrane ( Fig .
1A ) .
This effect was dependent on the concentration of TPA .
Whereas concentrations of 107° m or less had little , if any , effect , exposures to 5 X 107° m and higher TPA concentrations were associated with PKC activation ( Fig .
1A ) .
These findings corresponded with the ability of varying concentrations of TPA to induce a differentiated monocyte phenotype .
Thus , 5 X 107° m TPA was the lowest concentration found to activate PKC and induce monocytic differentiation .
The effects of 5 X 107° m TPA on PKC translocation were measured over time to determine whether activation of this enzyme is related to differentiation and retrodifferentiation .
Translocation of PKC activity from the cytosol to cell membrane was detectable after 2 min of TPA exposure , and nearly 90 % of the PKC activity was translocated by 8-15 min ( Fig .
1B ) .
An increase in membrane-associated PKC activity persisted for up to 29 days ( Fig .
1B ) .
However , increases in cytosolic activity were also detectable by 17 days ( Fig .
1B ) .
Moreover , the distribution of PKC activity in both the cytosol and cell membrane returned to near that of untreated cells by 30-36 days ( Fig .
1B ) .
The distribution of PKC proteins in subcellular compartments was analyzed by Western blots of long term cultured , differentiated U-937 cells .
Cytosolic PKCB was down-regulated between 5 min and 1 h after TPA treatment .
However , following culture of induced cells for 25 days in the absence of TPA , PKCB reappeared in the cytosol .
In contrast , there was no detectable 80 kDa PKCB8 protein in membrane preparations of uninduced and TPA-induced cells ( Fig .
24 ) .

Northern blot analysis of PKC-isoenzyme mRNA levels during long term culture of TPA-treated U-937 cells revealed low levels of PKCa and PKCy in control cells and cells treated for 1 h with TPA ( Fig .
2B ) .
Moreover , a 3-day exposure to TPA was associated with enhanced expression of PKCa and PKCy mRNAs .
However , when the cells underwent retrodifferentiation between 30 and 36 days , PKCa and PKCy expression declined to that observed in control cells .
In contrast , levels of a transcript of approximately 4.0 kb remained without apparent change during the course of the experiment ( Fig .
2B ) .
These findings suggested that the effects of TPA on PKC activation in U-937 cells are reversible .
TPA activates PKC by binding to this enzyme ( 9 ) .
Consequently , further studies were performed to determine whether binding of TPA corresponded to translocation of PKC activity .
U-937 cells were incubated with 5 X 107° m |HIJTPA for 3 days and then maintained in drug-free medium .
Lipid extraction and analysis by thin layer chromatography revealed that 11 + 0.9 % ( mean + SD ; n = 4 ) of the labeled TPA was bound during the first 3 days .
However , there was a progressive decline in the extent of TPA binding over 24 days ( Fig .

3 ) .
In accordance with the migration of fresh [ PH ] JTPA on a reference lane ( data not shown ) , the peaks of the radioactivity always appeared at the same point ( R , value = 0.3 ) .
The decline in incorporated H ] TPA during long term culture was associated with a progressive increase in the amount of tritium in the culture supernatant ( data not shown ) .
Taken together with the studies of PKC activation , these findings suggest that TPA binding and translocation of enzyme activity are related and reversible .
TPA binding and PKC activation were compared with changes in cellular parameters of a differentiated U-937 phenotype .
The initial 6 days following TPA exposure were associated with ( a ) decreases in B-galactosidase and a-mannosidase activities ; ( b ) release of TNF-a and IL-1 ; ( c ) increases in mRNA expression of the cytosolic intermediate filament protein vimentin ; and ( d ) increases in mRNA levels of the nuclear intermediate filament proteins lamin A and lamin C ( Fig .
4 ) .
These findings were consistent with induction of monocytic differentiation ( 2 , 13 , 14 ) .

proliferating cells in the absence of TPA for up to 24 days was associated with progressive increases in glycosidase activities and down-regulation of cytokine expression ( Fig .
4 ) .
Moreover , there were further increases in expression of the vimentin and lamin A/C mRNA transcripts during this time ( Fig .
4 ) .
Finally , each of these parameters returned to pretreatment levels by 36 days ( Fig .
4 ) .
These phenotypic changes were therefore in concert with the changes in the level of PKC activation .
Previous work has demonstrated that monocytic differentiation is associated with induction of c-fos and c-jun expression , as well as down-regulation of c-myb transcripts .
In the present studies , c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels were increased within 2-5 min in TPA-treated U937 cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
In contrast , there was no detectable effect of TPA on c-myb expression during 1 h of exposure ( Fig .
5 ) .
The induction of c-fos transcripts was detectable until 30 days , when the cells entered retrodifferentiation { Fig .
6 ) .
Similar findings were obtained for c-jun mRNA levels , although expression of this gene was biphasic with maximal increases at 12-24 h and between 3 and 18 days ( Fig .
6 ) .
As for c-fos expression , c-jun transcripts declined to control levels by 36 days ( Fig .
6 ) .
These changes in gene expression were associated with an initial decline in c-myb mRNA levels after 24-48 h and then subsequent increases to levels similar to those in untreated cells by 36 days ( Fig .
6 ) .
The reappearance of c-myb transcripts was associated with loss of cell adherence and reinitiation of proliferation ( data not shown ) .
Further studies were performed with staurosporine , a nonspecific inhibitor of PKC ( 15 , 16 ) , to determine whether activation of this enzyme is necessary for induction of the differentiated phenotype .
U-937 cells were pretreated for 15 min with varying concentrations of staurosporine before adding TPA .
The results show that staurosporine blocked TPA-induced adherence in a con-centration-dependent manner ( Table 1 ) .
Similar findings were obtained when monitoring proliferation .
Although 3 X 10 % m and 6 x 107 m concentrations had little , if any , effect on TPA-induced growth arrest , as determined by [ H ] thymidine incorporation , 107° m staurosporine partially blocked the growth-inhibitory effects of this agent , whereas no significant effect was detectable on uninduced U-937 cells ( Table 2 ) .

staurosporine ( > 5 X 10~° m ) significantly reduced the proliferation of uninduced U-937 cells ( Table 2 ) .
The effect of staurosporine on changes in gene expression were also examined in TPA-treated U-937 cells .
Although induction of U-937 cells with TPA for 1 h was associated with increases in c-fos and c-jun transcripts , pretreatment with 107 '' m staurosporine blocked the induction of these genes in part ( Fig .
7 ) .
This effect was more pronounced in experiments with 2 x 10~ '' m staurosporine ( Fig .
7 ) .
These results suggest that staurosporine , at nontoxic con-centrations , is a weak antagonist of TPA-induced changes .
Thus , TPA-induced PKC activation is involved at least partially in both changes in phenotype and gene expression associated with monocytic differentiation .
Discussion The human monoblastoid U-937 cell line has been used to study the involvement of PKC and the expression of protooncogenes during differentiation along the mono-cyte/macrophage lineage .
Recent studies have demonstrated that U-937 cells can be induced to differentiate by treatment with 5 X 10~ ' m TPA for 72 h ( 2 ) .
This concentration of TPA was sufficient to activate PKC , whereas lower concentrations had no detectable effect on the activity of this enzyme or induction of monocytic differentiation .
The differentiated U-937 cell phenotype was maintained in culture in the absence of TPA and changing the medium every 3 days .

over 36 days , however , was associated with the growth of a nonadherent population and appearance of a phenotype identical to that of control U-937 cells .
This phenomenon has been characterized by us as a retrodifferentiation ( 13 ) .
We have previously documented that this retrodifferentiation process is mediated neither by TPA-resistant subclones nor by noninduced cell artifacts ( 13 ) .
Moreover , the retrodifferentiated cells regain sensitivity to TPA and can be reinduced to differentiate along the monocytic lineage .
Although U-937 cells were treated with TPA for only 3 days , activation of PKC was associated with prolonged incorporation of PH ] TPA .
However , when the PH ] JTPA levels decreased below 1 % of initial binding , the cells began to retrodifferentiate , and the distribution of PKC returned toward patterns found in control cells , The unaltered R ; values of the radioactive peaks in accordance with a [ ° ' H ] TPA reference suggest that the major part of cell-associated TPA is not metabolized during long term culture .
In this respect , it is interesting to note that decreasing levels of cell-associated TPA are not only Cell Growth & Differentiation 545 £ £ U0 % UV UV G UV U o a - a ® 0 o # 4 © hast - ® ® 28S- 4 - c-fos 18s- ‘ m ... 28S-c-jun 188— ZSS-m c-myb 18Ss-Control 1885- mo 0 U0 @ # # w an Fig .

due to lateral diffusion into the culture supernatant , since the retrodifferentiation process can not be induced by extensive washes of TPA-treated cells ( data not shown ) .
Activation of PKC by TPA results in its translocation to the cell membrane ( 17 , 18 ) .
This effect is usually tran-sient , with subsequent degradation of PKC into regulatory and catalytic subunits ( 19 , 20 ) .
Western blot analysis in this study indicated a rapid down-regulation of PKCB protein in the cytosol of TPA-treated U-937 cells .
However , PKC activation was also detectable in the cell membrane fraction , and membrane-associated PKC activity per cell remained significantly elevated at 5 days .
This membrane-bound activity persisted at increased levels for up to 17-29 days .
Recent findings , which support our results , have demonstrated that PKCa is rapidly translocated in TPA-treated U-937 cells and then down-regulated after 3-6 h. At this time , membrane-associated PKCy activity is increased and remains activated for over 24 h ( 21 ) .
Although PKC is known to consist of at least seven isoenzymes with different Ca** and lipid affinities ( 22 , 23 ) , the present work has distinguished between the different expression pattern of PKCa , PKCB , and PKCy mRNA transcripts during long term culture of TPA-differentiated U-937 cells .
Temporal changes in distribution of PKC isoenzymes have been reported in TPA-treated HL-60 cells ( 24 ) .
These results suggest persistent activation of at least one form of this enzyme or subsequent activation of several different PKC isoenzymes during the process of differentiation which may depend on alterations in the lipid composition of the membranes .
This is also supported by our previous studies which demonstrate alterations in the membrane phospholipid composition during differentiation of U937 cells ( 25 ) .
TPA treatment is associated with translocation of PKC and induction of monocytic differentiation characterized by ( a ) growth inhibition ; ( b ) adherence ; ( c ) changes in glycosidase activity ; ( d ) cytokine release ; and ( e ) increases in filament expression .
These changes have previously been reported with appearance of the monocytic phenotype ( 13 , 14 ) .
Moreover , the induction of U-937 cell differentiation was associated with down-regulation of c-myb transcripts and rapid increases in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels .
Previous work confirmed these expression patterns during monocytic differentiation ( 4-6 ) .
Our results thus indicate that PKC activation is associated with specific changes in phenotype and gene expression during U-937 monocyctic differentiation .
Of interest , the persistent activation of PKC was associated with prolonged expression of the c-fos and c-jun genes .
With respect to c-jun , its biphasic and long term expression corresponding to the time course of c-fos is surprising and has not yet been shown .
Since the fos and jun proteins are known to form heterodimers with leucine zipper binding properties ( AP-1 ) ( 26 ) , the present data Table 1 - Effect of staurosporine on the adherence and viability of TPA-treated U-937 cells U-937 cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 5 ® 10° cells/ml .

The permanent 28S- activation of PKC or subsequent activation of PKC iso-C ‘ fOS enzymes in parallel with the high level of the protooncogenes c-fos and c-jun and the low level of c-myb 18S- suggests a crucial role for PKC in controlling both the arrested cell growth and the maintenance of these human tumor cells in a differentiated state .

Inhibition of c-fos and c-jun gene expression by 15-min prein-cubation of U-937 cells with staurosporine ( Stauro ) following 1-h TPA treatment .
suggest that early induction of the c-fos and c-jun genes is involved in the regulation of differentiation pathways in U-937 cells .
This has been shown recently for the c-jun gene expression in differentiating P19 embryonal carcinoma cells ( 27 ) .
The question whether the down-regulation of c-jun expression in U-937 cells after 3 days and its reinduction between 4-18 days is mediated by the subsequent activation of protein kinases ( i.e. , PKC isoenzymes ; pp60*~ kinase ; cyclic AMP-dependent PK ) and/or other factors remains to be investigated .
Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion for the nonadherent U-937 cells and by acridine orange staining of the adherent TPA-differentiated cells .
Protein Kinase C Assay .
U-937 cells were washed twice in PBS and suspended in homogenization buffer ( 20 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7.4-1 mm ethyleneglycol bis ( G-aminoethyl ether ) -N , N , N ' , N ' -tetraacetic acid-1 mm EDTA-5 mm 2,3-dihydroxybutane-1,4-dithiol ) .

The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 10 min to remove the nuclei .
The crude membranes and cytosol were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min , and the resulting supernatant was used as cytosolic fraction .
The pellet was resus-pended and solubilized for 30 min in homogenization buffer containing 5 mm 3 { [ ( 3-cholamidopropyl ) di-methylamino ] -1-propanesulfonate .
The solubilized membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation at Cell Growth & Differentiation 547 100,000 x g for 30 min .
Aliquots containing 10 ug of protein were used to measure PKC activity , as described with certain modifications ( 29 ) .
Briefly , the phosphoryl-ation of H1 histone in the presence or absence of 1 ug of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol and 5 ug of phosphatidylser-ine was measured in a final volume of 200 ul .
The reaction medium ( 100 ul ) [ 40 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7.4-0.4 mm ethyleneglycol bis ( # -aminoethyl ether ) -N , N , N ' , N ' -tetraacetic acid-1 mm CaCl ; -10 mm MgCl ; -40 ug of histone-6 nmol of [ y-*P ] -ATP ( 5 x 10° cpm/nmol ) ] was added to 100 ul of protein-containing homogenization buffer with or without lipids ( dispersed by sonication for 3 X 10 s at 50 W ) and was incubated for 3 min at 37°C .
The incubation was terminated by the addition of 200 al of chilled trichloroacetic acid ( 10 % w/v ) containing 1 mm ATP and 15 mm The mixture containing the precipitated proteins was applied to nitrocellulose filters , and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting .
PKC Western Blot Analysis .
Cytosol and the crude membrane fraction were prepared as described for the PKC assay .
Up to 100 ug of protein were separated in a 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Im-mobilon-P membrane as described ( 13 ) .
After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 5 % ( w/v ) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h , the blots were incubated for 12 h with the monoclonal antibodies MC-1a , MC-2a , and MC-3a diluted to 1 ug/ml in 0.25 % bovine serum albu-min-0.05 % Tween 20 , pH 8.0 .
These monoclonal antibodies were prepared against PKC isoenzymes PKCa , PKC # 8 , and PKCy , respectively ( 30 ) .
Following a 2-h incubation with ' '' l-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody , the blots were washed six to eight times with PBS , dried , and exposed to X-ray film .
Incorporation of TPA .
U-937 cells were incubated with 5 xX 10~ ' m PH ] TPA ( NEN ) for 72 h and then cultured in the absence of TPA for 24 days by replacing fresh medium every 3 days .
The cells ( 10° ) were washed three times with PBS , and lipid extraction was performed by chloroform/methanol ( 2/1 , v/v ) , as previously described ( 31 ) .
The samples , including a standard on a reference lane , were separated by thin layer chromatography using methylene chloride/acetone ( 3/1 , v/v ) as solvent system .
The thin layer chromatography plates were cut according to the R , ; values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 , and radioactivity was measured in a B-scintillation counter .
Glycosidase Activities .
Approximately 10 '' cells were washed twice with PBS and homogenized by sonication ( for 3 x 10 s at 50 W ) ( Labsonic cell disrupter ; Braun AG , Melsungen , Federal Republic of Germany ) .
Specific activities of B-galactosidase and a-mannosidase were measured in the cell homogenate by the capacity to cleave the appropriate p-nitrophenyl sugar as described elsewhere ( 32 ) .
Protein concentration was measured by microtiter Bradford protein assay ( 33 ) .
Release of Cytokines .
Cytokine release into the culture supernatant was measured for TNF-a and IL-18 using specific radioimmunoassays for these cytokines ( 34 , 35 ) .
TNF-a and IL-18 activities were also evaluated in the appropriate biological assay systems ( 36 ) .
Northern Blot Analysis .
Total cellular RNA from untreated and TPA-differentiated U-937 cells was prepared according to Chirgwin et al .
( 37 ) .
The resulting RNA pellets were solubilized in H , O , and the purity and concentration of the RNA were determined by absorb-ance measurements at 260 and 280 nm .
Aliquots of 20 ug of RNA were separated in agarose-formaldehyde gels according to Lehrach et al .
( 38 ) .
After electrophoresis , the RNA was transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes ( Amersham ) by capillary blotting ( 39 ) .
The filters were hybridized at 42°C for 12 h in 50 % formamide-1 % SDS-10 % dextran sulfate-1 m NaCl using the following random primer [ P ] dCTP labeled human cDNA probes : ( a ) a 1.3-kb EcoRl PKCa insert of a phPKC-a7 plasmid ; ( b ) a 1.8-kb EcoRI PKC insert of a phPKC-81-15-Eco plasmid ; ( c ) a 1.4-kb EcoRl PKCy insert of a phPKC-y6 plasmid ( all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) ; ( d ) a 1.8-kb BamHlI/EcoRl insert of a human c-jun DNA probe containing a 1.0-kb cONA and 0.8-kb 3'-untranslated sequences ( 40 ) purified from a pBluescript Sk ( + ) plasmid ( provided by Dr. R. Tjian ) ; ( e ) a 3.1-kb Xhol/Ncol c-fos insert of the pc-fos-1 plasmid ( 41 ) .
The c-myb cDNA and the 185 control cDNA probes were a generous gift from Dr. J. Schlehofer , German Cancer Research Center , Heidelberg , Federal Republic of Germany , and Dr. M. Revel , Weizmann Institute , Rehovot , Israel , respectively .
The filters were washed four times for 15 min at 42°C in 2 % saline-sodium phosphate-EDTA containing 1 % SDS and an additional four times in 0.1 % saline-sodium phosphate-EDTA containing 0.1 % SDS .
Thereafter , the filters were exposed at -80°C for 12-24 h. For vimentin and lamin A/C mRNA analysis , labeling of the appropriate probes and hybridization were performed as described elsewhere ( 13 ) .
Signal intensity was evaluated by laser densitometric analysis ( UltroScan ; LKB , Brommer , Sweden ) and compared to that for control U-937 cells .
