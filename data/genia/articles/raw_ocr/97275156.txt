Activation of the Pathway by Inflammatory Stimuli in Human Neutrophils By Patrick P. McDonald , Anette Bald , and Marco A. Cassatella Activated neutrophils have the ability to upregulate the expression of many genes , in particular those encoding cytokines and chemokines , and to subsequently release the corresponding proteins .
Although little is known to date concerning the regulation of gene transcription in neutrophils , it is noteworthy that many of these genes depend on the activation of transcription factors , such as NF- « B , for inducible expression .
We therefore investigated whether NF- « B/Rel proteins are expressed in human neutrophils , as well as their fate on cell activation .
We now report that dimers consisting of p50 NFB1 , p65 RelA , and/or c-Rel are present in neutrophils and that the greater part of these protein complexes is physically associated with cytoplasmic IkB-a in resting cells .
Following neutrophil stimulation with proinflammatory agonists ( such as lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] , tu- EUTROPHILS RANK among the first blood cells that migrate towards inflammatory lesions , where they accumulate in large numbers and perform host defense functions .
These include the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms or of foreign particles , the release of proteolytic enzymes , the generation of oxygen-derived reactive interme-diates , and the synthesis of potent lipid mediators such as leukotriene B , and platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) .
As a result , the relevance of neutrophils to host immunity has traditionally been viewed as being restricted to these effector functions .
In recent years , however , it has become evident that under various stimulatory conditions , neutrophils also have the ability to synthesize and release many proteins that can influence the course of inflammatory and immune responses .
A partial list of such proteins includes cytokines and related products , such as tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) , interleukin-1/ } ( IL-1/ # ) , and the IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) , as well as chemokines such as IL-8 , macrophage inflammatory protein-1 a ( MIP-1a « ) , and MIP-13 . '
Therefore , these observations emphasize the pertinence of considering neutrophils not only as professional phagocytes , but also as cells that can play a pivotal role in orchestrating inflammatory and immune processes .
The inducible production of these immunoregulatory proteins by neutrophils is usually preceded by , and largely dependent on , an accumulation of the corresponding mRNA transcripts , '' a process that is generally prevented by pre-treating the cells with the transcription inhibitor , actinomycin D ( and our unpublished observations , May 1992 ) .
It follows that transcriptional events are likely to play a central role in the induction of cytokine and chemokine production in neutrophils . '' '' ''
Although little is known to date concerning the regulation of gene transcription in neutrophils , a number of clues point to the potential involvement of distinct transcription factors in this process .
First , a common characteristic of the genes encoding TNF-a , IL-1ra , IL-8 , and MIP-1 @ , is that they all feature xB or « B-like binding motifs in their 5 ' regulatory region . '' ''
Moreover , the binding of NF- « B dimers to these motifs either suffices to confer transcriptional inducibility , '' or in the case of the IL-1ra gene , is required for full promoter activation . ''
Finally , a markedly increased expression of the transcripts encoding the above Blood , Vol 89 , No 9 ( May 1 ) , 1997 : pp 3421-3433 mor necrosis factor-a [ TNF-a ] , and fMet-Leu-Phe ) that induce the production of cytokines and chemokines in these cells , NF- « B/Rel proteins translocated to nuclear fractions , resulting in a transient induction of NF- « B DNA binding activity , as determined in gel mobility shift assays .
The onset of both processes was found to be closely paralleled by , and dependent on , IxB-a degradation .
Proinflammatory neutrophil stimuli also promoted the accumulation of IkB-a mRNA transcripts , resulting in the reexpression of the IkB-a protein .
To our knowledge , this constitutes the first indication that NF- « B activation may underlie the action of proinflammatory stimuli towards human neutrophil gene expression and , as such , adds a new facet to our understanding of neutrophil biology .

cytokines and chemokines can be induced in neutrophils by stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or TNF-a @ , *** '' which are known to be potent activators of NF-KB in other systems . '' ''
The transcription factor , NF- « B , consists of homo- or heterodimers of the Rel family proteins , p50/NFkB1 , p52/ NFxB2 , p65/RelIA , and c-Rel .
In most cell types studied to date , NF- « B dimers are retained in the cytoplasm through a physical association with inhibitor proteins , termed IB . ''
Following cell activation , IB becomes hyperphosphorylated on distinct serine residues , and a mounting body of evidence indicates that this hyperphosphorylation targets the inhibitor for proteolytic degradation ( reviewed in Finco and Bald-win '' ) .
The degradation of IxB eventually leads to its dissociation from NF- « B dimers , thereby allowing the movement of the latter towards the nucleus , where they may bind with high specificity to enhancer sequences in the 5 ' regulatory region of target genes .
Among those genes whose expression is most rapidly enhanced in a « B-dependent manner is the one that encodes IxB-a . '' '' ''
This , in turn , leads to the rapid resynthesis of the inhibitor protein , '' ** '' of which a portion accumulates in the nucleus where it is able to dissociate NF-xB dimers from DNA . ''
Fragmentary evidence also points to a potential role for IxB- « in retargeting NF-kB dimers From the Department of General Pathology , University of Verona , Verona , Italy .

3422 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , '' but the mechanism whereby this may occur remains unknown .
In the current study , we investigated the expression and distribution of NF- « B/Rel proteins and their cytoplasmic inhibitor , IkB-a , in human peripheral blood neutrophils , as well as their respective fate on cell activation .
We now report that following stimulation of neutrophils with proinflammatory mediators that are known to induce the production of cytokines and chemokines in these cells , cytoplasmic IkB-a becomes degraded and NF- « B/Rel proteins translocate to nuclear fractions , resulting in an increased nuclear NF- « B DNA binding activity .
Moreover , these various events are paralleled by the accumulation of IkB-a mRNA transcripts , which eventually leads to the protein synthesis-dependent reexpression of the IkB-a protein .
To our knowledge , this represents the first indication that NF- « B activation may underlie the action of proinflammatory stimuli towards human neutrophil gene expression .

Cell isolation and culture .
- Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors under endotoxin-free conditions by a modification of the method of Boyum , '' ' as described earlier . ''
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were enriched in monocytes by centrifugation over Percoll cushions , as previously described . ''
As determined by Wright staining and nonspecific esterase cytochemis-try , the final neutrophil suspensions consistently contained fewer than 0.5 % monocytes , and the monocyte-enriched suspensions contained 15 % to 35 % contaminating lymphocytes .
Neutrophil and monocyte viability exceeded 98 % after up to 3 hours in culture , as determined by trypan blue exclusion .
Purified cell populations were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % low-endotoxin FCS , at a final concentration of 5 X 10° cells/mL , and cultured in polystyrene flasks or in tubes at 37°C under a 5 % CO ; atmosphere , with occasional agitation .

These concentrations of the agonists were chosen on the basis of their being optimal for cytokine and chemokine production in human neutrophils. > '' '' '' * Electrophoreses and immunoblots .
- After the desired incubation period with the stimuli , aliquots of the cell suspensions were transferred into precooled tubes containing equivalent volumes of ice-cold RPMI 1640 supplemented with DFP ( 2 mmol/L , final concentration ) before centrifugation at 2,000g for 2 minutes at 4°C .
The resulting cell pellets were washed and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer ( 10 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.90 , 10 mmol/L NaCI , 1.5 mmol/L MgC ) , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 0.5 mmol/L EGTA ) containing 0.15 % NP4O0 and an antiprotease cocktail ( 2 mmol/L DFP , 1 mmol/L PMSF , 1 mmol/ L 4- ( 2-amino ethyl ) benzene sulfonyl fluoride ( AEBSF ) , and 10 pg/ mL each of aprotinin , leupeptin and pepstatin A , final concentra-tions ) .
Following a 10-minute incubation on ice , samples were briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 800g ( 10 minutes , 4°C ) .
The supernatants ( nonnuclear fractions ) were collected , and the pellets ( nuclear-con-taining fractions ) were washed twice in lysis buffer containing the aforementioned antiprotease cocktail .
Nonnuclear fractions were immediately dissolved twofold by the addition of an equal volume of sample buffer 2 % ( 50 mmol/L TrisBase pH 6.80 , 4 % sodium dodecyl sulfate [ wt/vol ] , 10 % 2-mercaptoethanol [ vol/vol ] , 20 % glycerol [ vol/vol ] ) , heated for 5 minutes at 95°C , and used immediately or stored at -20°C .

of DNAse buffer ( 20 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.50 , 1 mmol/L CaCl , 5 mmol/L MgC ) ; , 1 mmol/L EDTA ) containing 10 units of DNAse I and the aforementioned antiprotease cocktail , and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C .
Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of sample buffer 2 % , and samples were heated for 5 minutes at 95°C and used immediately or stored at -20°C .
Samples were electrophoresed on 15 % denaturing gels ( or 18 % gels in the case of IxB-a or FLAP ) , prepared according to the method of Thomas and Kornberg . ''
Proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose blotting membrane at 20 V constant for 60 minutes in a Transblot semidry transfer cell ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) .
Transfer efficiency was visualized by reversible Ponceau Red staining .

265 ) antiserum .
Antisera to FLAP and to LTA , hydrolase were used at 1:4,000 and 1:5,000 dilutions , respectively .
The membranes were then washed three times with 150 mL TBS , and incubated in TBS with a horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey antirabbit antibody , added to a final dilution of 1:10,000 , for 45 minutes at 37°C .
After three washes , the signal was revealed with the ECL reagent , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
As a positive migration control for NF- « B/Re !
proteins , a track of whole-cell samples from unstimulated Jurkat T cells was usually included on the gels .
Immunoprecipitations .
- Nonnuclear fractions were prepared as described above , deposited onto Microcon-100 microcolumns ( Ami-con Inc , Beverly , MA ) , which have a molecular weight cut-off of approximately 100 kD , and centrifuged ( 3,000g , 30 minutes , 4°C ) .
IkB-a was consistently undetectable in the eluates , as determined by immunoblot ( data not shown ) .
The retentates were flushed out of the microcolumns according to the manufacturer 's instructions , using 100 gL of immunoprecipitation buffer ( 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI pH 7.40 , 1 % NP40 , 150 mmol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L EDTA ) supplemented with the antiprotease cocktail .
Sample volume was then brought to 475 gL with immunoprecipitation buffer , and immuno-precipitations were performed as follows .
A total of 20 uL of a 1:2 ( vol : vol ) dilution of protein-G sepharose 4FF was mixed with preimmune rabbit serum ( 5 gL . )
for 30 minutes at room temperature .
Preclearing of the samples was achieved by incubating ( 120 minutes at 4°C , under agitation ) with the protein-G sepharose mixture .
Samples were then centrifuged ( 12,0008 , 2 minutes ) , and the protein-G pellets discarded .
During this time , 5 L of a 1:5 dilution of either anti-IkB-a antibody ( no .
9 ) , or antisera raised against individual Rel family proteins , was mixed with 20 uL of the protein-G sepharose mixture for 30 minutes at room temperature , before a 120-minute incubation with the supernatants ( 4°C , with agitation ) .
Samples were then centrifuged ( 10 minutes , 12,000g ) , and the resulting immunoprecipitates were washed three times with rinsing buffer ( 25 mmol/ L Tris-HCI pH 8.0 , 150 mmol/L NaCl , 0.1 % NP4O0 ) , before being dissolved in sample buffer and heated for 5 minutes at 95°C .
Following electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes , immunoblots were performed as described above .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .
- Neutrophils were cultured in the presence or absence of various stimuli for the indicated times ; incubations were stopped as described above , and the cells were pelleted and resuspended in ice-cold relaxation buffer ( 10 mmol/L PIPES pH 7.30 , 30 mmol/L KCI , 3 mmol/L NaCl , 3.5 mmol/L MgC ] ; , 1.25 mmol/L EGTA , 0.5 mmol/L DTT ) containing the antiprotease cocktail .
Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation , using a modification of a previously published procedure . ''
Briefly , neutrophils ( 10° cells/mL . )
were pressurized under a N ; atmosphere ( 350 psi , 20 minutes at 4°C ) with constant stirring in a nitrogen bomb ( Parr Instrument Co , Moline , IL ) .
Cavitates were spun at 1,000g ( 10 minutes , 4°C ) , to pellet unbroken cells and intact nuclei , and the supernatants were recentrifuged ( 1,000g , 10 minutes , 4°C ) to remove remaining nuclei and unbroken cells .
Both pellets were combined and resuspended in 200 pL relaxation buffer containing the antiprotease cocktail ; the resulting suspension was laid onto 2 X 400 uL of a Percoll step gradient ( 1.050 and 1.120 g/mL ) , and centrifuged at 2,200g ( 10 minutes , 4°C ) .
The top of the gradient ( containing the unbroken cells ) was discarded , and the nuclei-rich fraction at the interface of the two Percoll layers was carefully collected , diluted in relaxation buffer containing the antiprotease 3423 cocktail , and repelleted ( 1,500g , 10 minutes , 4°C ) , to rid the nuclei of remaining Percoll .
The 1,000-g ( postnuclear ) supernatants were centrifuged at 13,0005 ( 15 minutes , 4°C ) to pellet neutrophil gran-ules .
The resulting 13,000-g supernatants are referred to as `` 'cyto-plasmic '' fractions , even though they do contain plasma membranes in addition to cytosol .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by a modified Dignam procedure . ''
Washed nuclear pellets were gently resuspended in ice-cold relaxation buffer containing 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol and the antiprotease cocktail ; NaCl was then added to yield a final concentration of 380 mmol/L .
Following a 20-minute incubation on ice ( with occasional mixing ) , samples thus treated were spun at 13,000g ( 15 minutes , 4°C ) , and the resulting supernatants ( the nuclear extracts ) were aliquoted and immediately stored at -70°C .
Similarly , cytoplasmic fractions were supplemented with glycerol ( 10 % final concentration ) and with concentrated NaCl ( to yield a final concentration of 150 mmol/L ) , and incubated on ice for 20 minutes before centrifugation at 13,000g ( 15 minutes , 4°C ) .
The resulting supernatants , referred to as cytoplasmic extracts , were aliquoted and stored at -70°C before use .
In some experiments , whole-cell extracts were prepared by processing neutrophil cavitates in the same manner as described above for cytoplasmic extracts .
Small aliquots of the various extracts were routinely processed for protein content determination .
EMSA was performed essentially as described earlier , '' '' with the following modifications .
Binding reactions were performed in 20 pL binding buffer ( 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.50 , 50 mmol/L KCI , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 1 mmol/L DTT , 0.1 % ( vol/vol ) NP40 , 6 % glycerol ) supplemented with 20 ug acetylated BSA and 1 pg poly ( dI-dC ) .
Extracts ( amounts used are indicated in the figure legends ) were then added to the binding mixture and allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes at room temperature .
In some instances , binding mixtures containing cytoplasmic or whole-cell extracts were sequentially treated ( 10 minutes , room temperature ) with 0.7 % sodium deoxycho-late ( DOC ) ( vol/vol ) and 1 % NP-40 ( vol/vol ) , to dissociate NF- « B complexes from endogenous inhibitors . ''
For competition or supershift experiments , binding reactions were performed in the presence of cold competitors or of specific antisera , for 20 minutes at 4°C .
Finally , 40,000 cpm of an oligonucleotide containing the consensus NF- « B sequence , **P-end-labeled using T4 polynucleo-tide kinase , was added to the binding mixtures , which were further incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature .
The resulting samples were electrophoresed on 6 % native gels at 4°C in 0.5 % TBE .
Isolation of mRNA and Northern blots .
- Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously . ''
For this purpose , an IxB-a @ cDNA fragment was [ a-*P ] -dCTP-labeled with a Ready-to-Go DNA labeling kit ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) , before hybridization on nylon filters and autoradiography .
This IkB-a cDNA fragment was prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) amplification of mRNA purified from LPS-stimulated monocytes , using oligonucleotide primers that are specific for IxB-a ( kindly provided by Dr S. Haskill ) .
Contaminating monocyte mRNA was undetectable in our neutrophil preparations , as the filters did not hybridize with an IL-6 cDNA probe . ''
RESULTS Relative abundance and distribution of NF- « B/Rel proteins in resting human neutrophils and monocytes .
To determine which Rel family proteins are present in human neutrophils , as well as their distribution in resting cells , subcellular fractions obtained by NP4O lysis were electrophoresed and processed for immunoblotting using specific antisera to individual NF-kB/Rel proteins .

- Cellular distribution of NF- « B/Rel proteins in peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes .
( A ) Unstimulated neutrophils or monocyte-enriched mononuclear cell suspensions from the same donor were submitted to NP40 lysis , and the resulting nuclear-containing and nonnuclear fractions were processed for electrophoresis on 15 % Kornberg gels ( using 10° cell-equivalents per well , unless otherwise stated ) and immu-noblotting , as described in Materials and Methods .
For p105 and p50 , the immunoblot was performed using the no .

For p65/RelA , the immunoblot was performed using an antiserum to the N-terminal region ( no .

Figure 1A shows that in addition to abundant quantities of c-Rel , whose presence in neutrophils has already been reported , '' neutrophils were also found to contain p50/NFB1 and its precursor , p105 , as well as p65/ReIA .
In contrast , neither p52/NFxB2 nor its precursor , p100 , were detectable in neutrophils , even when 4 million cell-equivalents were loaded on the gels ( data not shown ) .
By comparison , monocyte-enriched suspensions contained substantial amounts of p52 and p100 ( Fig 1A ) .
Noteworthy is that in neutrophils , immunoblot detection of p65 ( but not that of c-Rel or p50 ) using both the C-terminal and N-terminal antisera required the presence of DFP in the various buffers used during sample preparation ( data not shown ) , in agreement with recent observations made in certain U937 cell subclones containing elevated levels of intracellular proteases that are typically found in granulocytes .

NF-kB ACTIVATION IN HUMAN NEUTROPHILS In both neutrophils and monocytes , a greater proportion of the Rel family proteins was recovered in the non-nuclear fractions ( Fig 1A ) .
A similar cellular distribution was observed in resting neutrophils disrupted by nitrogen cavitation instead of detergent lysis , with the exception that nuclear levels of Rel proteins were less abundant using the cavitation procedure ( data not shown ) .
The presence of detectable quantities of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel ( but not p100 or p105 ) in the nuclear fractions of neutrophils and monocytes , however , prompted us to ascertain the identity and purity of our subcellular fractions .
For this purpose , we examined their respective FLAP and LTA , hydrolase content ( Fig 1B ) .
FLAP is an 18-kD protein that is known to be exclusively located in the nuclear envelope of human neutrophils and monocytes , '' while LTA , hydrolase , a protein of approximately 70 kD , is strictly cytosolic , regardless of whether cells are fractionated by sonication '' or nitrogen cavitation ( unpublished data , October 1995 ) .
That FLAP was only detected in nuclear fractions , and LTA , hydrolase in nonnuclear fractions , demonstrates that these subcellular fractions are reasonably exempt from cross-contamination .
Interestingly , neutrophils were found to contain more FLAP than autologous monocytes , in agreement with previous observations . ''
Another noticeable difference between neutrophils and monocytes is that the latter contain more cytoplasmic NF- « B/Rel proteins than the former .
This was particularly evident in the case of p52/ p100 , as already mentioned .
Conversely , neutrophils were found to contain more nuclear p50 and c-Rel than monocytes .
Collectively , these differences indicate that results obtained using our neutrophil preparations do not reflect a contribution of contaminating monocytes , in agreement with the fact that monocytes account for less than 0.5 % of the cells ( as determined by esterase cytochemistry ) .
We also investigated the physical association of NF- « B/ Rel proteins with one another in nonnuclear fractions of resting neutrophils .
For this purpose , the fractions were immunoprecipitated using antisera to individual NF- « B/Rel proteins , and the resulting immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for c-Rel or p65/ReIA .
Figure 2 shows that in addition to being efficiently precipitated by a combination of anti-p65 antisera ( no .
1207 and no .
1226 ) , the p65/ReIA protein could also be coimmunoprecipitated using antisera raised against either c-Rel or p50 .
Similarly , c-Rel was not only immunoprecipitated using an antiserum to itself , but also by either anti-p50 or anti-p65 antisera ( Fig 2 ) .
In addition , immunoblot analysis of the same immunoprecipitates using an anti-p50 antiserum ( no .
1157 ) showed that while the antiserum efficiently brought down the p105 protein , the p105 signal was consistently below detection in anti-cRel and anti-RelA immunoprecipitates ( data not shown ) ; under these conditions , the immunoglobulin heavy chain strongly interfered with the detection of p50 .
This indicates that very little , if any , cytoplasmic RelA or c-Rel is complexed to p105 .
Therefore , the immunoprecipitable RelA or c-Rel brought down using the anti-p50 antiserum must principally reflect heterodimers containing p50 ( as opposed to p105 ) , consistent with the fact that neutrophils contain considerably more p50 than p105 ( Fig 1A ) .
Similar results were obtained using cytosolic fractions from neutrophils disrupted by nitrogen cavitation instead of NP4O lysis ( data not shown ) .

Following NP40 lysis of neutrophils , nonnuclear fractions were immunoprecipitated using antisera to individual NF- « B/Rel proteins , and immunoprecipitates ( 2.5 x 10° cell-equivalents ) were analyzed by immunoblot using an antiserum to the N-terminal region of p65/RelA { no .

Redistribution of Rel family proteins following neutrophil activation .
- To investigate the fate of NF- « B/Rel proteins following cell activation , neutrophils were stimulated with various agonists , and the resulting nuclear fractions were analyzed by immunoblot .
Figure 3 shows that in response to 1 ug/mL , LPS , c-Rel , p65/ReIA , and p50 translocated to the nuclear fractions ; this was paralleled by a decrease in the amount of these proteins in the corresponding nonnuclear fractions ( data not shown ) .
The effect of LPS towards the translocation of Rel family proteins was rapid , as it was detectable within 10 minutes and was sustained for up to 2.5 hours .
In this respect , the elevated nuclear levels of all three Rel proteins were indistinguishable between NP4O-disrupted and cavitated neutrophils following LPS stimulation ( data not shown ) .
Stimulation of neutrophils with 100 U/mL TNF-a yielded qualitatively identical results with respect to both the extent and time course of NF- « B/Rel protein translocation ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , a redistribution of NF- « B/Rel proteins was also observed in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils , although it required approximately 45 minutes to be evident ( Fig 3 ) .
Whereas c-Rel and p65/ RelA were efficiently mobilized to the nucleus in response to fMLP , it must be stressed that under the same conditions , only a minor fraction of cytoplasmic p50 translocated to nuclear fractions .
In five independent experiments , this modest translocation of the p50 protein was clearly observed in three donors ( as depicted in Fig 3 ) , whereas it was less evident in the other two .

In the same experiments , cycloheximide pretreat-ment also failed to affect the total cellular pool of immunoreactive Rel family proteins , regardless of whether the cells were subsequently stimulated ( for up to 2.5 hours ) with ei- Table 1 .

NF-kB ACTIVATION IN HUMAN NEUTROPHILS sively detected in the nonnuclear fractions , which comi-grated with authentic thI « kB- « .
The identity of this band was ascertained in control experiments by preincubating our anti-IxkB-a antibody with the recombinant protein , a treatment which prevented its subsequent detection by immunoblot ( data not shown ) .
Conversely , a nonspecific band that was sometimes detected right below the authentic band could not be displaced by this treatment .
We next investigated the physical association of IxB- « with Rel family proteins in resting neutrophils .
To this end , nonnuclear fractions from resting neutrophils were immunoprecipitated with antisera to individual NF- « B/Rel proteins and immunoblotted using an anti-I « kB-a antibody .
As shown in Fig 4B , this allowed the detection of IxB-a @ in all immunoprecipitates .
Thus , it appears that in resting neutrophils , IkB-a is complexed with protein dimers consisting of at least one of the three Rel family proteins that are present in these cells .
Further support for this conclusion is that both RelA and c-Rel were detected by immunoblot analysis of neutrophil nonnuclear fractions immunoprecipitated using an anti-IxB- « antibody ( data not shown ) .
To determine the fate of IxB-a following cell activation , neutrophils were stimulated under the same conditions that were found to promote the nuclear translocation of Rel family proteins .
Figure 4C shows that in cells stimulated with 1 ug/ml LPS , cytoplasmic I « kB-a « levels had substantially decreased by 10 minutes , reaching a minimum after 20 to 30 minutes ( depending on the donor ) .
This gradual loss of immunoreactive IkB-a protein was accompanied by the detection of a slower-migrating band , which presumably represents a hyperphosphorylated IxB-a species , based on similar observations made in other cell types . ''
Interestingly , we repeatedly observed that a weak residual amount of IxB-a protein was still detectable following cell stimulation ; we do not know at present whether this reflects an incomplete degradation of IkB-a or the rapid onset of de novo protein synthesis .
Nevertheless , evidence in favor of the latter mechanism is that the loss of IxB-a was invariably followed by an increase in the level of the protein , which was usually detectable after approximately 40 minutes of stimulation , and the cellular pool of IkB-a was almost replenished by 60 minutes ( Fig 4C ) .
Further evidence is that exposure of neutrophils to 20 pg/mL .
cycloheximide for 30 minutes before LPS stimulation prevented this reappearance of IkB-a ( data not shown ) , although a weak residual amount of IxB-a protein was often detectable following cycloheximide treatment .
Taken together , these data indicate that IxB- @ reexpression is mostly dependent on de novo protein synthesis .
In neutrophils stimulated with 100 U/mL TNF- @ , IkB-a was degraded and reexpressed with similar kinetics as in LPS -treated cells ( data not shown ) .
By comparison , the loss of immunoreactive IkB-a protein was only evident after 30 to 60 minutes ( depending on the donor ) in neutrophils stimulated with 10 nmol/L FMLP ( Fig 4C ) .
In five independent experiments , cytoplasmic levels of IkB-a had returned to near basal levels after 120 minutes in three donors ( as depicted in Fig 4C ) , whereas the reappearance of the protein was only observed after 180 minutes in the other two donors .

This experiment is representative of three .
( B ) Ethidium bromide staining of the gel corresponding to the autoradio-grams depicted in ( A ) .
ing neutrophil stimulation with LPS , TNF-a , or fMLP , prompted us to investigate whether this response might be paralleled by changes in IxB- « mRNA steady-state levels .
Neutrophils were , therefore , stimulated for varying lengths of time with either LPS , TNF-a , or fMLP ; total RNA was then extracted and processed for Northern blot analysis .
Figure 5 shows that a low quantity of IkB-a transcripts was consistently detected in resting neutrophils ; following cell exposure to either LPS or TNF-a , a dramatic and sustained accumulation of IxB- « mRNA was observed .
In neutrophils thus stimulated , the steady-state level of IxB-a mRNA remained elevated even after 3 hours of stimulation , relative to unstimulated controls ( data not shown ) .
By comparison , fMLP induced a less marked and more transient accumulation of IxB-a transcripts ( Fig 5 ) .
This effect of fMLP could be detected as early as 30 minutes and had become completely undetectable by 120 minutes ( data not shown ) .
In a separate series of experiments , neutrophils were pretreated with either 5 pg/mL actinomycin D or 20 pg/mL cycloheximide ( or their respective diluents ) for 30 minutes at 37°C before stimulation with LPS or fMLP for 45 minutes at 37°C .
Actinomycin D was found to block the accumulation of IkB-a transcripts , whereas cycloheximide superinduced it ( data not shown ) .
Both compounds exerted a similar effect on the steady-state level of IxB- « mRNA in unstimulated cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it appears that while the inducible accumulation of IkB-a mRNA involves transcriptional events , it does not require the synthesis of proteic factors .
Induction of NF-kB DNA binding activity following neutrophil activation .
- That neutrophils can be induced to mobilize NF- « B/Rel proteins to the nucleus strongly suggested that this response , as well as the related cellular events that occur under the same conditions , might be paralleled by NF-B activation .
Figure 6A shows that whole-cell extracts from resting neutrophils contained a latent NF-kB DNA binding activity ( complex A ) that became detectable following DOC treatment , as determined by EMSA .

The various DNA-binding complexes are indicated by the letters , A , B , and C. The amount of extract used in the binding reactions corresponded to 620,000 cell equivalents ( approximately 20 ag of protein } .
( B ) Neutrophils were cultured in the absence ( first lane ) or presence of LPS as indicated in ( A ) , and whole-cell extracts ( `` WC '' ) , as well as the corresponding cytoplasmic { `` CYT '' ) and nuclear ( `` N '' ) extracts , were analyzed in EMSA .

Before addition of the labeled NF-B oligonucleotide probe to the binding mixture , extracts were incubated with a 10- , 25- or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-xB oligonucleotide ( `` cold '' ) , or with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing mutated NF- « B binding sites ( `` mut '' ) .

Accordingly , the inducible NF- « B DNA trary , the fastest-migrating DNA binding activity ( complex binding activity present in whole-cell extracts of LPS -treated C ) appeared to be nonspecific , as competitor oligonucleo-neutrophils was detected in nuclear extracts prepared from tides did not significantly impede its detection ( Fig 6C ) .
In the same cells , but not in the corresponding cytoplasmic similar experiments , the inclusion of rh IxB-a protein in the extracts ( Fig 6B ) .

NF-kB ACTIVATION IN HUMAN NEUTROPHILS A ) was further retarded following coincubstion of the extracts with anti-p50 or anti-RelA antisera , whereas an anti-c-Rel antiserum weakly , but consistently , impaired the detection of the complex .
In contrast , the use of an anti-p52 antiserum invariably failed to exert a significant effect , consistent with our finding that the p52 protein is undetectable in human neutrophils .
Identical results were obtained using either whole-cell extracts of LPS- or TNF- « -treated neutrophils , or DOC-treated whole-cell extracts from resting neutrophils ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it appears that the inducible NF- « B complex primarily consists of p50/p65 heterodimers , but that it may also contain minor amounts of c-Rel-containing complexes .
Finally , it is noteworthy that the faster-migrating NF- « B DNA binding activities present in neutrophil whole-cell and cytoplasmic extracts ( complexes B and C ) were unaffected by any of the antisera ( Fig 6D and data not shown ) .
Similar bands were also weakly detected in monocyte or Jurkat extracts ; in contrast to neutrophil extracts , these faster-migrating complexes were much less abundant than complex A , but were equally unaffected by our antisera .
In view of the fact that the nuclear translocation of NF-kB/Rel proteins followed different time courses depending on the stimulus , we next investigated the kinetics of NF-KB activation in neutrophils stimulated with various agonists .
As shown in Fig 7A , the effect of LPS towards nuclear NF- « B activation was rapid and transient , as it was clearly detectable within 10 minutes , reached a maximum between 20 and 30 minutes , and had returned to near-basal levels by 60 to 90 minutes .
A similar time course of NF- « B activation was observed when neutrophils were exposed to 100 U/mL TNF-a or 10 ng/mL IL-1 # ( Fig 7B ) , although the latter cytokine proved to be significantly less potent than LPS or TNF-a in inducing this response , in agreement with our immunoblot data .
In contrast , stimulation of neutrophils with chemoattractants such as fMLP ( Fig 7A ) resulted in a delayed activation of NF- « B , insofar as it required between 30 and 40 minutes to be evident , depending on the donor ; the magnitude of this response was also somewhat modest , relative to that observed following LPS or TNF-a stimulation .
Another difference between the effect of fMLP and that of LPS or TNF- « is that in response to the latter agonists , a second increase in NF- « B DNA binding activity was sometimes detected after 90 minutes of stimulation ( data not shown ) .
We also examined the effect of a wide range of other neutrophil stimuli towards nuclear NF-KB activation .
Figure 7B depicts the comparative ability of some of these agonists to activate NF-KB in neutrophils , and the overall results of these experiments are summarized in Table 2 .
We finally performed control experiments to ensure that the inducible NF-kB DNA binding activity ( complex A ) detected in our neutrophil suspensions did not reflect the presence of contaminating monocytes .
The rationale for these experiments is that although the proportion of contaminating monocytes in our neutrophil preparations is marginal ( ie , less than 0.5 % ) , monocytes were nevertheless found to express substantially more NF- « B/Rel proteins than neutrophils on an individual cell basis ( Fig 1A ) .
Neutrophil and monocyte-enriched suspensions from the same donor were , therefore , cultured in the presence or absence of 1 pg/mL .

The 20-minute time point was selected because it allows for maximal NF-KB activation to occur in both cell types .
Figure 8 shows that a similar extent of NF- « B activation ( complex A ) was observed using approximately three times less monocytes than autologous neutrophils .
Thus , it appears that while monocytes have a markedly superior ability to activate NF- « B on a per-cell basis , a monocyte contamination of at least 25 % would be required to account for the detection of the inducible NF- « B DNA binding activity observed in our neutrophil preparations .
Consistent with these results is that when monocyte whole-cell extracts representing 100 times less cells than the corresponding neutrophil extracts ( ie , to mimic the equivalent of 1 % contaminating monocytes ) were analyzed in EMSA , the monocyte extracts consistently failed to yield any detectable From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

The data presented in Fig 7B can serve as an approximate reference of the relative ability of some of these stimuli to induce NF- « B activation .
NF- « B signal ( data not shown ) .
These experiments clearly show that the minimal level of contaminating monocytes present in our neutrophil suspensions can not reasonably account for the NF- « B DNA binding activities detected in our neutrophil extracts .
Further support for this conclusion is that the p52 and p100 proteins were readily detected by immunoblot using 10° monocytes ( Fig 1A ) , whereas they were undetectable using four times more neutrophils , and that IL-6 mRNA , which is indicative of monocyte contami-nation , '' '' was undetectable in our neutrophil preparations , as determined by Northern blot .
DISCUSSION In this study , we report that among Rel family proteins , p50/NFB1 ( and its precursor , p105 ) , as well as p65/ReIA and c-Rel , are present in human neutrophils , albeit in smaller quantities than in autologous monocytes , while p52/NF « B2 ( or its precursor , p100 ) was only detected in the latter cell type .
It is tempting to speculate that this greater abundance of Rel family proteins in monocytes , in conjunction with the markedly superior extent to which monocytes ( respective to neutrophils ) activate NF-KB in response to stimuli such as LPS , might provide a partial explanation for the numerous observations in the literature showing that neutrophils have a much lower transcriptional activity than monocytes on an individual cell basis ( reviewed in Cassatella ' ) .
In both cell types , IxB-a was strictly cytoplasmic , and accordingly , immunoreactive NF- « B/Rel proteins were principally recovered in the cytoplasmic fractions of resting cells .
This is in McDONALD , BALD , AND CASSATELLA keeping with the ability of IkB-a to directly interact with either p50 , p65/ReIA , or c-Rel , '' '' '' '' and thereby keep them sequestered in the cytoplasm .
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments not only confirmed that in neutrophils , IxB-a is physically associated with protein complexes containing p50 , p65 , or c-Rel , but also showed that some of these cytosolic complexes could be identified as p50/c-Rel , p50/p65 , and p65/c-Rel heterodimers .
Despite their predominantly cytoplasmic localization , detectable amounts of NF- « B/Rel proteins were consistently observed in nuclear fractions of unstimulated neutrophils and monocytes , and this was not attributable to a cytosolic contamination of the nuclei .
In keeping with these data , a constitutive nuclear NF-kB DNA binding activity was also detectable in both cell types .
In neutrophils , this constitutive activity was found to comprise both p65/ReIA and p50 , and possibly some c-Rel-containing complexes , as well ( our unpublished data ) .
Similarly , p65/ RelA was reported to be present in nuclear extracts of unstimulated human monocytic THP-1 cells , '' and NF- « B DNA binding activities containing p50 were detected in nuclear extracts of unstimulated peripheral blood monocytes and of various monocytic cell lines . '' ''
Although the significance of these observations is unclear , it has been recently proposed that constitutive nuclear NF- « B might contribute to the constitutive expression of transcripts encoding « B-dependent genes . ''
This suggestion stemmed from the finding that cycloheximide treatment of resting Mono Mac 6 monocytic cells increased both the constitutive nuclear NF-B activity and the steady-state level of TNF-a mRNA .
* '' In agreement with these data , we observed that in unstimulated neutrophils , cycloheximide not only increased the amount of nuclear-associated NF- « B/Rel proteins ( albeit without affecting the total cellular pool of these proteins ) , but also superinduced the steady-state level of IxB-a mRNA ( unpublished data , January 1996 ) .

NF-kB ACTIVATION IN HUMAN NEUTROPHILS the involvement of constitutive nuclear in the basal expression of « B-dependent genes still awaits a more direct demonstration .
Among a wide range of neutrophil agonists , TNF-a , LPS , fMLP , and PMA were found to efficiently induce both the nuclear accumulation of NF- « B/Rel proteins and the concomitant degradation of cytoplasmic IxB-a @ , whereas IL-1/3 , LTB , , and PAF proved to be weaker stimuli at the concentrations tested .
Moreover , the onset of both processes was paralleled by the activation of nuclear NF- « B DNA binding activity .
In contrast , GM-CSF , G-CSF , interferon- ( IFN- @ ) , IFN-y , IL-8 , and IL-10 exerted no detectable effect on any of these responses ( up to 120 minutes ) .
From a general stand-point , these observations are in good agreement with the reported action of the same stimuli towards the activation of the NF- « B pathway in other cell types ( reviewed in Baeuerle and Henkel'® and Siebenlist et al '' '' ) .
In the particular case of IL-1/3 , it must be stressed that although it is a potent inducer of Rel protein nuclear translocation , NF- « B DNA binding activity , and < B-dependent gene expression in many cell types , its stimulatory action towards cytokine and chemokine gene expression in neutrophils is rather limited .
For instance , IL-1/ # is less potent than LPS or TNF-a in inducing its own gene expression or that of IL-8 , '' in keeping with our present data concerning the moderate ability of ( compared with TNF-a or LPS ) to mobilize NF- « B/Rel proteins to the nucleus and to activate NF-kB .
Conversely , the nuclear mobilization of NF- « B/Rel proteins ( in particular , that of p65/ReIA and c-Rel ) was also induced by fMLP in neutrophils , resulting in an increase in nuclear NF-kB DNA binding activity , even though fMLP has heretofore not been described as an inducer of NF- « B activation .
Nevertheless , isolated studies had already provided indirect evidence that in granulocytes , fMLP may exert some of its actions by acting through the NF- « B pathway .
In HL-60 cells differentiated along the granulocytic lineage , treatment with antisense oligonucleotides to p65/ReIA reduced RelA expression and diminished the ability of fMLP to upregulate CD11b expression without affecting its ability to induce a respiratory burst . ''
Similarly , exposure of neutrophils to FK506 , a drug that hinders NF- « B activation in T cells , '' '' partially inhibited the fMLP-elicited synthesis of cellular proteins , despite a normal increase in intracellular calcium . ''
These observations are , therefore , in good agreement with the fMLP-in-duced redistribution of Rel family proteins and NF-KB activation reported herein .
In neutrophils , the stimuli that promoted the nuclear accumulation of Rel family proteins and concomitant NF- « B activation could be subdivided into two general categories : those whose action was rapid and slower-acting ones .
The effect of the former ( TNF-a and LPS , and on a much smaller scale , IL-1/ # ) was already evident by 10 minutes and had reached a maximum by 30 minutes .
In contrast , the latter agonists ( FMLP and PMA , and to a lesser extent , PAF and LTB , ) required at least 30 minutes to exert a similar action , a maximal effect being usually observed between 45 and 60 minutes .
This delayed induction is not likely to reflect a requirement for endogenously produced mediators such as TNF-a or IL-1/ # , as fMLP lacks the ability to induce their release from neutrophils ( unpublished data , May 1992 ) .
Sim- 3431 ilarly , neither the nuclear accumulation of NF- « B/Rel proteins , nor the activation of NF-kB , could be prevented by a prior treatment of the cells with cycloheximide ( unpublished data , December 1995 ) , indicating that this response can not be attributed to newly synthesized proteic factors .
As in most other cell types studied to date , the nuclear translocation of Rel family proteins and concurrent activation of NF- « B in neutrophils appeared to depend on the degradation of IxB-a , as the onset of all three processes occurred in close parallel , regardless of the type of agonist used .
More direct evidence is the finding that AEBSF ( a protease inhibitor ) not only blocked the inducible degradation of IxB-a , as already reported , '' but also prevented both the nuclear accumulation of Rel family proteins and NF- « B activation under the same conditions ( unpublished data , January 1996 ) .
Therefore , the differences observed between fast-acting and slower-acting stimuli must reflect a differential ability to activate cellular processes that lead to IxB-a degradation , such as those that bring about its phosphorylation .
The central role of the events controlling IxB-a @ expression within the context of the NF-kB pathway is further illustrated by the fact that regardless of the stimulus used , reexpression of the inhibitor protein correlated well with the termination of nuclear NF-kB DNA binding activity in neutrophils .
It must be recalled , however , that nuclear levels of Rel family proteins remained elevated even when NF-kB DNA binding activity was no longer detected .
This apparent contradiction might find its explanation in light of a recent study , which showed that in HeLa S3 cells briefly exposed to TNF , and then washed free of the stimulus , the termination of NF-kB activation correlated with the detection in nuclear extracts of a fraction of the de novo-synthesized IkB-a , which was physically associated with RelA- or p50-containing complexes . ''
Under these conditions , nuclear levels of p50 eventually decreased with time .
In contrast , when HeLa S3 cells were continuously exposed to TNF ( as in the present study ) , IxB- @ was only weakly detected in nuclear extracts , despite the fact that considerable amounts of extract were processed for immunoblot analysis . '' ''
Moreover , the loss of p50 from nuclear fractions of TNP-treated cells was not evident under these conditions , '' '' similar to the present observations .
Thus , it is conceivable that in neutrophils that are continuously exposed to a given stimulus , a small amount of de novo-synthesized IkB-a might localize to the nucleus , which could suffice to prevent NF- « B binding , yet without substantial changes in nuclear levels of Rel family proteins .
Alternatively , the loss of NF-kB DNA binding activity observed at late time points in stimulated neutrophils might reflect changes in the phosphorylation status of nuclear NF- « B/Rel proteins .
In this regard , it has been reported that p65/ReIA becomes tran-siently phosphorylated following TNF-a stimulation of as-trocytes , and that in TNF-stimulated HeLa cells , RelA phosphorylation occurs in parrallel with that of IkB-a and p105 . '' '' ''
Similarly , phorbol ester stimulation of Jurkat T cells has been shown to result in the phosphorylation of both p105 and p50 .
`` ° More importantly , these studies have demonstrated that the phosphorylated forms of RelA and p50 both confer a considerably enhanced DNA-binding activity to NF-kB dimers , relative to their unphosphorylated counterparts . ''
Thus , it can be envisaged that in stimulated From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

3432 neutrophils , the nuclear accumulation of Rel proteins might be paralleled by their phosphorylation , and that the termination of NF-KB activation might partially reflect a subsequent dephosphorylation , despite elevated nuclear levels of NF-kB/Rel proteins .
Similarly , the significant amounts of Rel proteins found in the nuclei of resting neutrophils might exhibit low DNA-binding activity as a result of their being unphosphorylated .
We finally demonstrated that in neutrophils , the degradation of the IkB-a protein and concomitant nuclear activation of NF-kB were accompanied by a marked accumulation of I « xB- « mRNA transcripts , resulting in the reexpression of the protein itself , through de novo synthesis .
This inducible accumulation of IkB-a mRNA was prevented by actinomycin D pretreatment , indicating the involvement of transcriptional events , and was protein synthesis-independent , in that it was not inhibited by cycloheximide pretreatment .
Together , these observations raise the possibility that in neutrophils , the inducible accumulation of IkB-a transcripts might rely on the activation of preexisting transcription factors .
In view of the known requirement for NF- « B complexes to bind their cognate sites within the gene promoter to enhance gene expression , '' it can be reasonably argued that these transcription factors must include members of the NF- « B family .
In keeping with this assertion is that the same stimuli , which were found to upregulate IxB-a @ gene expression in neutrophils , were also found to promote NF- « kB activation .
In a broader context , these stimuli also have the ability to induce the expression of other < B-dependent genes in neutrophils , in particular those encoding cytokines and chemokines .
`` * '' '' '' '' As in the case of IxB-a @ , the nuclear mobilization of Rel family proteins occurring in response to these stimuli is likely to result in increased gene expression , inasmuch as the binding of Rel protein dimers to the « B and « kB-like motifs located in the 5 ' regulatory region of the genes encoding TNF-a , IL-1 } , IL-8 , and MIP-1a @ is sufficient to confer transcriptional inducibility , `` * '' '' and is required for the full activation of the IL-1ra gene promoter . ''
In con-clusion , the coordinate translocation of NF- « B/Rel proteins to the nuclear compartment , where they can bind as homo-or heterodimers to the « B or « B-like motifs located in the promoter region of « B-dependent genes , could constitute one of the mechanisms whereby the expression of these genes is enhanced on neutrophil stimulation .
Studies are in progress to further define the potential involvement of NF- « B activation in the expression of selected genes in human neutrophils .
