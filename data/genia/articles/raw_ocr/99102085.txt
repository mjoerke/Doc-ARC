and fLaboratoire d'Immunologie , CHU Rangueil , 31403 Toulouse Cedex 4 , France Activated T-lymphocytes are found early in atherosclerosis lesions , but little is known about their role .
Oxidized low-density lipoproteins ( OxLDLs ) are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the lesions , and we have previously demonstrated that oxLDLs inhibit not only interleukin ( IL ) -2-receptor expression on the surface of in vitro-activated T-lymphocytes but also their proliferation .
We have now investigated the effect of oxLDLs on blast differentiation , on IL-2 synthesis and on the activation of the nuclear factor xB ( NF- « B ) system in activated lymphocytes .
Mildly oxLDLs ( 50 and 100 ug/ml ) decreased the number of lymphoblasts and the level of IL-2 concentration in the culture supernatants after activation of lymphocytes by phytohaemagglutinin and PMA +ionomycin .
The inhibition of IL-2 production was observed in the CD3+* T-lymphocyte cytoplasm as early as 4 h after activation by PMA +ionomycin .
The study of NF- « B showed that oxLDLs led to a decrease of activation-induced p65/p50 NF- « B heterodimer binding to DNA , whereas the presence of the constitutive nuclear form of p50 dimer was unchanged .
This was correlated with an unchanged level of the active form of the cytosolic inhibitor protein IxB- « .
Taken together , these observations suggest that the immunosuppressive effect of oxLDLs might operate via a dysregulation of the T-lymphocyte activation mechanisms .
Key words : atherosclerosis , lipoproteins , lymphokines , IB , immunosuppression INTRODUCTION Low-density lipoproteins ( LDLs ) deliver cholesterol and other lipids to peripheral cells [ 1 ] .
Oxidized LDLs ( oOxLDLs ) participate in the development of atherosclerotic lesions [ 2 ] .
Among the pleiotropic effects on cellular functions , oxLDLs induce the production of interleukins ( ILs ) such as IL-1- $ , IL-8 , IL-10 and IL-1 2 in resting monocytes [ 3-5 ] and inhibit tumour necrosis factor a and IL-1 # mRNA and protein expression in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages [ 6 ] .
oxLDLs may also activate resting lymphocytes through a monocyte-mediated process [ 4,7 ] , but they inhibit the proliferation of activated peripheral-blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and T CD4* lymphocytes [ 8,9 ] .
The role of lymphocytes in atherosclerosis has not been clearly defined .
While some data suggest that the immune system plays only a minor role in atherogenesis [ 10,11 ] , others demonstrate that T-lymphocytes participate in the progression of the lesions [ 12-15 ] .
For example , atherosclerotic lesions are reduced in T-cell-deficient hyperlipidaemic mice [ 12 ] .
In contrast , some authors have shown that lymphocytes could , at least in the early phase , slow down atherogenesis [ 16-20 ] , e.g .
the B-lymphocyte response against oxLDLs has a protective effect against lesion development in rabbits [ 20 ] .
In humans , activated T-cells are present early in atherosclerotic lesions [ 21-23 ] .
The mechanisms involved in T-lymphocyte activation are still unknown , but the role of specific antigens such as OxLDLs , heat-shock proteins and viral proteins has been suggested [ 7,22 ] .
Activation of T-cells with antigens , phorbol esters or mitogens can trigger a programme of gene expression inducing cell proliferation and differentiation .
Among the early events induced after activation is the expression of the genes for IL-2 and CD25 ( x-chain of IL-2 receptor ) .
The secretion of IL-2 and the expression of CD25 by T-lymphocytes are necessary for their lymphoblast transformation and proliferation .
Among the most important events controlling gene activation are those involving the nuclear factor « B ( NF- « B ) family [ 24,25 ] .
NF- « B is present in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of resting T-cells , bound to the inhibitor proteins termed IB ( inhibitor of « B ) .
A member of this family , IxB- « , binds the p50/p65 heterodimer of NF- « B in the cytoplasm .
After activation [ e.g .
by phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) or PMA +ionomycin ] , IxB- « is phosphorylated , ubiqui-tinated and degraded , whereas the p50/p65 heterodimer trans-locates into the nucleus , specifically binds the DNA- « B region and activates gene transcription [ 24,26 ] .
Functional « B elements have been found on the promoters of the IL-2 and CD25 genes [ 24 ] .
In a recent work we have demonstrated that mildly oxLDLs suppress the T-lymphocyte proliferative response .
This observation suggests that oOxLDLs may inhibit T-cell responses in atheroslerotic lesions [ 9 ] .
Mildly oxLDLs were obtained using UV radiation and were characterized by relatively low levels of peroxidation products without major apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) alteration , which permitted uptake of oxLDLs through the normal apoB/E-receptor pathway [ 27 ] .
In the present work we have studied the effect of oxLDLs on NF-KB activation and IL-2 synthesis , which are early events induced by activation of T-lymphocytes .

RPMI 1640 medium containing Glutamax I , penicillin , streptomycin , sodium pyruvate were purchased from Gibco ( Cergy-Pontoise , France ) .
T , polynucleotide kinase , NF- « B site of the « -light-chain enhancer ( 5-AGTTGAGGGGAC-TTTCCCAGGC-3 ' ) and API site ( 5-CGCTTGATGAGTCA-GCCGGAA-3 ' ) were provided by Promega ( Madison , WI , U.S.A. ) .
[ y-*°P ] ATP and [ *H ] thymidine were from ICN ( Orsay , France ) .
Acrylamide stock solution ( 40 % ) and lymphocyte separation medium were obtained from Eurobio ( Les Ulis , France ) .
LDL isolation and oxidation LDLs ( d= 1.019-1.063 ) and lipoprotein-depleted serum ( LPDS ) were isolated from pooled fresh human sera , dialysed , sterilized and stored at 4 °C as previously described [ 27 ] .
Mildly oxLDLs ( containing mainly lipid peroxidation derivatives with only minor alterations of apoB ) obtained by irradiation by UV light ( UV-C , 254 nm , 0.5 mW /em* , for 2 h ) [ 27 ] were used .
LDLs contained 0.2 +0.1 nmol of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) /mg of apoB and 15+3 nmol of hydroperoxides/mg of apoB and oxLDLs contained 44+ 0.4 nmol TBARS $ S/mg apoB and 92 +11 nmol mg apoB .
In some experiments LDLs were oxidized by CuSO , ( 5 aM , 2 h , 37 °C ) and contained 3.8 +0.8 nmol of TBARS/mg of apoB and 154 +13 nmol of hydroperoxides of apoB under our experimental conditions .
Cell culture and activation of lymphocytes PBMC were separated from heparinized venous blood of five healthy donors by centrifugation ( 20 min , 1500 g ) , using a lymphocyte separation medium .
Peripheral-blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) were obtained by removing adherent cells after PBMC incubation ( 2 h , 37 °C ) in 60-mm-diameter plastic Petri dishes .
The PBL suspensions contained approx .
75-85 % T-cells , 5-10 % B-cells , 10-15 % Natural Killer cells and 0.5-1 % monocytes .
During experiments , cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing Glutamax I , supplemented with penicillin ( 100 units/ ml ) , streptomycin ( 100 ug/ml ) , sodium pyruvate ( 1 mM ) and 2 % LPDS .
Cells were activated by PHA ( 1 ug/ml ! )
or PMA ( 10 ng/ml ! )
and ionomycin ( 100 ng/ml ) .
PHA is known to activate only some T-cell subpopulations in PBL ( mimicking the effect of antigens that activate T-cells through T-cell receptor signalling ) [ 24,28-31 ] , whereas PMA +ionomycin can potentially activate all lymphocyte populations [ 24,28 ] .
Previous pharmacological studies showed that the activator concentrations used are sufficient to promote T-cell stimulation , including the activation of NF- « B , the production of IL-2 and CD25 and cell proliferation [ 28 ] .
Proliferative assays and cell-viability evaluation Proliferation was measured by the standard uptake assay as follows .
Cells ( 10 % /ml of RPMI/2 % LPDS ) were seeded in round-bottomed 96-well plates ( 100 wl/well ) .
Cells were incubated from 24 to 72 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO , .
A 1 4Ci portion of [ H ] thymidine ( 1 Ci = 37 Gbq ; ICN , Orsay , France ) was added to each well for the last 16 h. Cells were harvested on glass-fibre filters by means of a semi-automatic cell harvester ( Harvester 96° Tomtec ; Wallac-EG & G Instruments , Evry , France ) , and the amount of { H ] thymidine ( c.p.m . )
incorporated was determined on Micro-beta® trilux ( Wallac-EG & G instruments ) .
The mean radioactivity from triplicate cultures was used for calculation .
In some experiments , recombinant IL-2 ( generously given by SANOFI , Labége , France ) was added .
The cell viability was determined by the Trypan Blue-exclusion test and detection of apo2.7 antigen by flow-cytofluorimetric analysis .
Flow-cytofluorimetric analysis PBL were surface-labelled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD3 ( IOT , Marseille , France ) and Tri Color-conjugated anti-CD25 antibodies ( Tebu , Le Perray en Yvelines , France ) .
Lymphocyte and lymphoblast events were gated on the side scatter ( granularity ) and forward scatter ( size ) dot-plot and selected cells were then analysed by double fluorescence .
Intracytoplasmic cytokine ( IL-2 ) detection was performed according to a method used for the examination of cytokine kinetics in Th1/Th2 balance ( L. Rostaing , J. Tkaczuk and M. Durand , unpublished work ; full details are available from M.D .
on request ) .
Briefly , after 0.3 % formaldehyde /PBS fixation , cells were first labelled at the surface with a peridinin-chlorophyll-protein-conjugated anti-CD3 antibody ( Becton-Dickinson , Le Pont de Claix , France ) and then perforated with 0.1 % saponin/ PBS .
An appropriate dilution of a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IL-2 antibody ( Becton-Dickinson ) was then added for a 30 min incubation .
After washing , cells were fixed in 0.5 % formaldehyde/PBS before cytofluorimetric acquisition .
Preparation of cell extracts PBL were harvested and washed twice in cold PBS , resuspended in 0.4 ml ( per 10° cells ) of buffer A ( 10 mM Hepes/10 mM KCl/1 mM - MgCl , /l1 mM - dithiothreitol/0.1 mM - EGTA/ 0.5 mM EDTA/lmM PMSF/2 ug/ml leupeptin/10 ug/ml aprotinin/2 ug/ml pepstatin ) , and incubated on ice for 20 min .
A 25 ul portion of 10 % Nonidet P40 was next added , cells were mixed vigorously for 10s and centrifuged ( 1200 g , 20 min ) .
Supernatants corresponding to the cytosolic fraction were used directly for immunoblotting .
Pelleted nuclei were washed once with buffer A , resuspended in 40 l of buffer C ( 20 mM Hepes/ 400 mM NaCl/1 mM MgCl , /l1 mM dithiothreitol/0.1 mM EGTA/O.5 mM EDTA/lmM _ PMSF/2ug/ml - leupeptin/ 10 ug/ml aprotinin/2 ug/ml pepstatin ) , incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged ( 20000g , 20 mn ) .
The supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were used for electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) analyses .
Protein concentration was measured with a commercial kit ( Bio-Rad protein assay , Bio-Rad Laboratories , Miinchen , Germany ) .
Immunoblotting analysis After heating , 60 ug of cell protein was resolved by SDS/PAGE on 10 % -acrylamide gels and transferred on to nitrocellulose membrane ( Hybond-C ; Amersham International , Amersham , Bucks. , U.K. ) .
The specific antigens were detected with anti-IkxB- « and actin antibodies ( Tebu ) and revealed by the Amersham enhanced-chemiluminiscence ( ECL® ) method .

Effect of oxLDLs on DNA synthesis and lymphoblast recruitment after PHA activation of PBL Figure 1 - Effect of oxLDLs on the blast transformation and the proliferation The majority of lymphocytes in the blood are in resting state ( G , -phase ) .
Activation of lymphocytes induces their transformation to lymphoblasts and the commitment to the cell cycle [ 29 ] .
The lymphoblast population can be discriminated from resting lymphocytes by a cytofluorimetric analysis using side-scatter ( granularity ) and forward-scatter ( size ) parameters .
We have previously demonstrated that mildly oxLDLs ( over 10 ug/ml ! )
inhibited the { H ] thymidine uptake by activated T-lymphocytes without cell-death increase [ 9 ] .
As shown in Figure 1 ( A ) , the inhibition is correlated with a decrease in the blast population .
This effect was time- and concentration-dependent ( Figures 1A and 1B ) .
In addition , the mitogenic response to PHA of PBL preincubated for 24 h with oxLDLs ( 10 , 50 and 100 ug/ml ) and then washed was not inhibited and was similar to that of cells preincubated with native LDLs , suggesting that oxLDLs are not toxic on resting lymphocytes after 24 h incubation .
The preincubation with oxLDLs did not decrease the sensitivity of lymphocytes to PHA stimulation ( Figure 1C ) .
Finally , experiments indicated that a co-incubation for 24 h of PBL with PHA + oxLDLs is sufficient to induce an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation ( Figure 1D ) , suggesting that oxLDLs can alter the events triggering the DNA synthesis in activated T-lymphocytes during the first 24 h. Among the first steps of activation is the binding of PHA to the cell surface of T-lymphocytes .
We have previously demonstrated that the inhibition is not due to interference of oxLDLs with the binding of PHA [ 9 ] .
Effect of oxLDLs on IL-2 secretion of T-lymphocytes As shown in Figure 2A , when lymphocytes were activated by PHA the IL-2 concentration rose sharply during the first 24 h and decreased afterwards in supernatants .
The presence of native LDLs ( 100 and 200 ug/ml ) maintained ( or increased ) the IL-2 level .
In contrast , incubation with oxLDLs ( 100 or 200 ug/ml ) induced a significant decrease of IL-2 concentration as soon as 24h after activation .
Moreover , this inhibition was directly correlated with the TBARS and hydroperoxide levels of oxLDLs ( results not shown ) .
The comparison of UV-oxLDLs with 2 h-Cu-oxLDLs , characterized by a similar mild oxidization level , indicated that the inhibition of IL-2 secretion ( Figure 2B ) or of PHA-induced proliferation ( results not shown ) was independent of the oxidation methods .
For examining the earlier effect of oxLDLs , the intracytoplasmic IL-2 level was analysed by cytofluorimetry .
In PHA-activated lymphocytes , IL-2*CD3*® cells were not detectable of activated lymphocytes ( A ) PHA-activated PBL were incubated in triplicate cultures with 50 and 100 gg/ml !
of native LDLs ( open symbols ) or oxLDLs ( closed symbols ) for 72 h in RPMI/2 % LPDS .
The percentage of the blast population ( squares ) was estimated by cytofluorimetry ( % of blast < 2 % in unstimulated PBL } .
Cell proliferation ( circles ) was determined by [ °HJthymidine uptake ( c.p.m .
< 500 in unstimulated PBL ) .
The results are the mean + S.D .

Results are expressed as means of triplicate determinations of blast-cell percentage .
A second experiment performed with a different donor gave identical results .
( C ) PBL in triplicate cultures were ( i ) co-incubated for 96 h with PHA-4-10 , 50 and 100 gg/ml of native LDLs ( ) or oxLDLs ( @ ) , ( ii ) pre-incubated for 24 h with 10 , 50 and 100 gg/ml of native LDLs ( [ C ] ) or oxLDLs ( BB ) , washed three times , activated by PHA and cultured for 72 h. Proliferation was estimated by determination of [ PH uptake .
Results are expressed as percentage of the control and are means for two independent experiments performed with PBL from different donors .
( D ) PBL were co-incubated with PHA and 10 , 50 and 100 pg/ml oxLDLs for 24 h , washed three times and incubated in the absence ( squares ) or in the presence ( circles ) of oxLDLs for 48 h. Results are expressed as c.p.m.. A second experiment performed with PBL from a different donor gave similar results .
before 8 h by flow cytometry ( results not shown ) .
So we have used a stronger stimulator of IL-2 secretion , i.e .
PMA + ionomycin .
When PBL were activated by PMA + ionomycin , the concentration of IL-2 in the supernatant was much higher than that observed after PHA activation ( Figure 2C ) .
However , the inhibitory effect of oxLDLs was very similar to that observed in the case of activation by PHA and was already appreciable by 24 h. Cytofluorimetric analysis detected a significant signal as soon as 4 h after stimulation : 17+4 % of IL-2*CD3+* positive cells ( versus 0.6+0.3 % in unactivated-CD3+* lymphocytes ) .
As shown in Figure 2 ( D ) , the IL-2+* T-cell percentage significantly decreased in the presence of oxLDLs ( 50 and 100 ug/ml ) as compared with cells incubated with LDLs .
To determine whether the decrease of IL-2 secretion induced by oxLDLs can directly be involved in the inhibition of pro-liferation , we added recombinant IL-2 to the cultures .
As shown in Figure 3 , the addition of IL-2 stimulated DNA synthesis when PHA-activated lymphocytes were cultured without or with oxLDLs for 72 h. The proliferation increased as a function of the IL-2 concentration in control cultures and in cultures with 50 ug/ml oxLDLs , but seemed to reach a limit when the activated lymphocytes were cultured with 100 ug/ml oxLDLs .
The same results were obtained when IL-2 was added 24 h 272 S.

after the beginning of activation ( results not shown ) .
In agreement with our previous data , a clear inhibition of CD25 expression was observed at the surface of CD3* lymphocytes incubated with 50 and 100 ug/ml oxLDLs ( Figure 3 , inset ) .
The decreased T-cell proliferation is thus partly explained by a relative lack of IL-2 and a decreased IL-2 receptor expression at the surface of the lymphocytes .
Effect of oxLDLs on the binding of NF-xB to DNA in activated PBL The results mentioned above suggest that oxLDLs may act before 4 h on events induced by T-lymphocyte stimulation .
The activation of T-lymphocytes by antigens and mitogens triggers the early trans-activation of the IL-2 gene , which depends on the binding of NF- « B to specific DNA sites .
We have examined the translocation of NF- « B to the nucleus by EMSA after activation of PBL by PHA or PMA-+ionomycin .
In agreement with previous studies [ 28,30,31 ] , nuclear extracts from resting lymphocytes contained a constitutive nuclear band corresponding to p50/p50 homodimers ( Figure 4A ) .

One other separate experiment , performed with a different donor , gave identical results .
In the inset is shown the expression of CD25 in PHA-activated CD3+* T-lymphocytes cultured for 72 h with oxLDLs .
The results are expressed as CD25 mean fluorescence intensity ( MF ) in double-positive populations activation induced the decrease of the p50/p50 homodimer band and the emergence of a new retarded band corresponding to the binding of the oligonucleotide with the p65/p50 heterodimer .
This later dimer is involved in the activation of IL-2 and CD25 genes after stimulation of T-cells with antigens , anti-CD3 antibodies , PHA or PMA + ionomycin [ 28,30,31 ] .
When lymphocytes were exposed simultaneously to oxLDLs and activator , the intensity of this last band decreased whereas the p50/p50 homodimer band was unchanged .
Figure 4 ( B ) shows the spec-ificity of the p65/p50 heterodimer as supershifts revealed by a preincubation with specific anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies and competition with an irrelevant unlabelled oligonucleotide ( AP1 ) and the specific unlabelled NF- « B oligonucleotide .
Since exposure to oxLDLs seemed to inhibit the NF-kB activation induced by PHA or PMA + ionomycin in lymphocytes , the role of the inhibitor IxB- « was examined in the same experimental conditions .
As expected , lymphocyte activation led to a rapid proteolytic removal of IxB-a in the absence of lipoproteins .
This proteolysis was not modified by LDLs , whereas oxLDLs clearly blocked the cytoplasmic depletion of I « xB-a ( Figure 4C ) .
DISCUSSION The present data demonstrate that mildly oxLDLs inhibit the blastic transformation of PHA-activated lymphocytes .
This is in agreement with our previous work showing an inhibition of DNA synthesis and an accumulation of cells at the G , -phase/S-phase interface in activated T-lymphocytes [ 9 ] .

The data are representative of two independent experiments performed with lymphocytes from different donors .
Similar results ( not shown ) were observed after PHA activation .
( C ) The PBL were activated in the same way as described for ( A ) .
The cytoplasmic I « B- « protein ( IxB ) and the control Z-actin were detected by Western blot using a specific antibody .
The data are representative of three independent experiments performed with lymphocytes from different donors .
the subsequent proliferative response to PHA , a similar incubation of activated lymphocytes induced a maximal inhibition , suggesting that the sensitivity to OxLDLs depends on the activation state of lymphocytes ( Figure 1D ) .
We have previously shown that oxLDLs inhibit the expression of CD25 24 h after lymphocyte activation by PHA , whereas the expression of CD69 and HLA-DR is unchanged .
The present work demonstrates that IL-2 synthesis was also inhibited by oxLDLs .
This effect is time- and dose-dependent and correlates with the level of LDL oxidation at the time of activation .
The decrease in intracytoplasmic IL-2 level in CD3* T-lymphocytes can be demonstrated as soon as 4 h after stimulation .
Taken together , these data suggest that the suppressive effect of oxLDLs on T-lymphocyte proliferation is a consequence of the inhibition of IL-2 secretion and of the impairment of CD25 expression , since the interaction of IL-2 with its receptor is usually required for activated T-lymphocytes to progress from the G , - to the S-phase of the cell cycle [ 29 ] .
During T-cell activation , the expression of IL-2 and CD25 genes is one of the earliest events .
This gene expression involves several identified nuclear complexes such as NF- « B , AP-1 , NF-AT [ 25,29-31 ] .
The present data strongly suggest that oxLDLs might inhibit the expression of the two proteins ( IL-2 and CD25 ) , because they alter , at least partly , the transcription mechanisms involving the NF- « B family .
Indeed , oxLDLs ( 100 ug/ml ) down-regulated the activation-induced binding of p65/p50 heterodimers to a consensus sequence of DNA and maintained the nuclear presence of p50 dimers probably involved in the repression of IL-2-gene transcription [ 25 ] .
Since « B elements have been found on the promoters of several other cytokine genes in lymphocytes and monocytes , the inhibition of the NF- « B system might also be involved in the oxLDL-induced impairment of production of interferon-y ( known to be synthesized by activated T-lymphocytes ) [ 8 ] and of IL-1 # and tumour necrosis factor- « ( produced by activated monocytes ) previously reported [ 6 ] .
The effect on NF- « B activation was observed immediately after lymphocyte stimulation , but we can not exclude the possibility that oxLDLs alter NF- « B activation at later time points and thus dysregulate the control of several genes encoding other growth-regulating proteins [ 30,31 ] .
Indeed , T-cell activation induces an early decrease in the level of p50 dimers in the nucleus and a concomitant increase in the level of active p50/p65 heterodimers [ 24,25,28,30,31 ] , whereas in the late phase ( from 24 to 72 h after activation ) the expression of the p50 NF- « B protein is increased progressively [ 32 ] .
Our data demonstrate that oxLDLs inhibit the activation-induced depletion of the IxB- « protein immediately after stimulation .
In resting lymphocytes , IxB-a « is bound to the p50/p65 heterodimer in the cytoplasm .
When lymphocytes are exposed to inducers of NF-kB , IkB-a is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded by the proteasome , whereas the heterodimer is trans-located [ 26,30 ] .
Our results suggest that the NF- « B inhibition could be explained either by an absence of IxB degradation ( e.g. , decrease of its proteolysis by the proteasome ) or by a dysregulation of its phosphorylation .
Using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical tech-niques , activated NF- « B has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions in smooth-muscle cells , macrophages and endothelial cells [ 33 ] .
Several recent studies have shown that , in these various cell types , the NF- « B system can react differently to oxLDLs .
According to the level of oxidation of LDLs , the cell type and/or the activation state of the cells , oxLDLs may activate or inhibit NF- « B [ 3,6,34,35 ] .
For instance , a short exposure to oxLDLs can activate NF- « B in resting monocytes and be accompanied by an increase of IL-8-promoter-dependent transcription [ 3 ] .
In contrast , preincubation or co-incubation of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -activated monocytes with oxLDLs inhibit NF- « B activation [ 3,6,35 ] .
Similarly , in vascular smooth-muscle cells , oxLDLs inhibit LPS-induced activation of NF- « B [ 36 ] .
In agreement with these data , the results of the present study suggest that oxLDLs may suppress the activation of NF- « B factors in lymphocytes , leading to the subsequent inhibition of 274 S. Caspar-Bauguil and others IL-2 synthesis and IL-2 receptor expression .
However , several other transcription factors control the IL-2 and CD25 gene expression in activated lymphocytes and could be differently altered by oxLDLs .
A recent study using human mono-cytes-macrophages showed that oxLDLs activate transcriptor AP1 [ 37 ] .
Another study demonstrated that oxLDLs have similar inhibitory effects on LPS-induced activation of NF- « B and API in macrophages [ 6 ] , whereas others suggest that they have opposing effects on the two transcription factors [ 36 ] .
Preliminary results in our laboratory indicate that oxLDLs might induce a moderate down-modulation of API binding to DNA after PHA or PMA +ionomycin-mediated activation .
Several signal-transduction pathways may lead to the activation of NF-kB proteins in T-lymphocytes .
For example , PKC- and Ca**-dependent pathways participate in the regulation of NF- « B activation [ 38 ] .
oOxLDLs are known to be able to induce various intracellular transduction signals in endothelial cells , smooth-muscle cells and macrophages [ 35,39-42 ] .
Experiments are in progress with inhibitors to assess the putative modulating effect of oxLDLs on various signalling processes .
It is not known which factor in oxLDLs is responsible for the observed effect on lymphocytes .
Under our experimental con-ditions , oxLDLs are mainly oxidized at the lipid level and are taken up by lymphocytes via LDL receptors [ 27 ] , and lipid oxidation is characterized by no significant modification of lysophosphatidylcholine content , and a moderate increase of oxysterols and hydroperoxides [ 9,43 ] .
It has been suggested that lipid oxidation products have an important biological effect on transcriptional regulation .
For instance , oxysterols inhibit LPS-induced activation of NF- « B in macrophages and smooth-muscle cells [ 6,36 ] , and it can be proposed that lipid oxidation products such as oxysterols and hydroperoxides may be involved in the inhibition of the T-cell activation .
The present results indicate that mildly oxLDLs may dysregulate the NF- « B system and inhibit IL-2 production in lymphocytes .
Taken together with our previous observations [ 9 ] , these experiments suggest that oxLDLs may inhibit early steps of the T-lymphocyte activation .
In atherosclerosis , the oxLDLs might alter the lymphocyte activation in site or minimize the response of activated T-lymphocytes , which migrate toward the lesions .
The role of this potential immunosuppressive effect on the progression of the atherosclerotic lesions remains to be demonstrated in vivo .
Since recent reports suggest that common chronic infections may contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis [ 44 ] , oxLDLs might impair the immune response against the infections of the vascular wall and thus be involved in the progression of the atherosclerotic lesions .
