Institut Curie , CNRS , Paris , France ; 'Centro de Biologia Molecular , Universidad Autonoma , Madrid , Spain According to current models the inhibitory capacity of IxB « would be mediated through the retention of Rel/ NF-xB proteins in the cytosol .
However , IxBa has also been detected in the nucleus of cell lines and when overexpressed by transient transfection .
To gain better insight into the potential role of nuclear IxB « in a physiological context we have analysed its presence in the nucleus of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes ( PBL ) .
We demonstrate the nuclear localization of IxBa « in PBL by different techniques : Western blot , indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy .
Low levels of nuclear IxBa « were detected in resting cells whereas a superinduction was obtained after PMA activation .
The nuclear pool of IxB « showed a higher stability than cytosolic IxBx and was partially independent of the resynthesis of the protein .
Unexpectedly , the presence of nuclear IxBa & did not inhibit NF-xB binding to DNA and this phenomenon was not due to the presence of at the nuclear level .
Immunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate an association between nuclear and NF-xB proteins .
Our results demonstrate that in resting and PMA-activated human PBL , is present in the nucleus in an apparently inactive form unable to disrupt NF-xB binding from DNA .
Keywords : IK Ba ; NF-xB ; nuclear ; T lymphocytes Introduction The Rel/NF-xB family of transcription factors plays a major role in the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses , cell differentiation and control of apoptosis ( reviewed by Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1996 ; Ghosh et al. , 1998 ) .
In addition NF-xB is an important regulatory element for HIV replication in normal CD4 T lymphocytes ( Alcami et al. , 1995 ; Chen et al. , 1997 ) .
The human Rel/NF-xB family of transcription factors include NF-xB1 ( p50 ) ( Bours et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ) , NF-xB2 ( p52 ) ( Neri et al. , 1991 ) , RelA ( p65 ) ( Ruben et al. , 1991 ; Nolan et al. , 1991 ) , RelB ( Dobrzanski et al. , 1993 ) , c-Rel ( Nakayama et al. , 1992 ) and the proteins p105 and p100 ( Bours et al. , 1990 ; Kieran et al. , 1990 ; Neri et al. , 1991 ) , classically considered as precursor proteins of Correspondence : J Alcami *Current address : Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia , Universidad Autonoma , Madrid , Spain Received 12 February 1998 ; revised 21 September 1998 ; accepted 21 September 1998 p50 and p52 respectively , although recently it has been pointed out ( Lin et al. , 1998 ) that p105 and p50 do not exhibit a precursor-product relationship .
All these proteins share a conserved region , the Rel homology domain ( RHD ) which contains sequences involved in DNA binding , protein dimerization , nuclear localization sequences and domains of interaction with their inhibitors ( reviewed by Baeuerle and Henkel , 1994 ) .
The different Rel/NF-xB subunits associate through the RHD forming homo- or heterodimers with different affinities and transcriptional activities on the different xB consensus sequences ( Fujita et al. , 1992 ; Kretz-schmar et al. , 1992 ; Perkins et al. , 1992 ) .
The main regulatory mechanism of NF-xB is mediated through its interaction with inhibitory proteins - IxB molecules - that retain NF-xB in the cytosolic compartment ( for review see Verma et a/. , 1995 ) .
The IxB family includes IxBa « ( Haskill et a/. , 1991 ) , IxBB ( Thompson et al. , 1995 ) , p105 and p100 ( Henkel et al. , 1992 ; Rice et al. , 1992 ) , IxBse ( Whiteside et al. , 1997 ) and Bcl3 ( Ohno et al. , 1990 ) .
All these proteins are characterized by the presence of multiple ankyrin repeats in their structure and their capacity to bind Rel/NF-xB transcription factors ( reviewed in Baeuerle and Henkel , 1994 ; Beg and Baldwin , 1993 ) .
Following T cell activation by different stimuli such as antigen recognition , cytokines , tumor promoters ( PMA ) , lipopolysacaride ( LPS ) and infection with different viruses , NF-kB dissociates from IxB « and translocates to the nucleus ( Baeuerle and Henkel , 1994 ; Baldwin , 1996 ) .
Upon cell activation IxBa is targeted to degradation by signal-induced phosphorylation ( Beg et al. , 1993 ; Finco and Baldwin , 1995 ) and the protein is subsequently conjugated to ubiquitine and degraded in the proteasome ( Traenckner et al. , 1994 ; Lin et al. , 1995 ; Roff et al. , 1996 ) .
However , besides its cytosolic localization , IxBa has been detected in the nucleus when it is overexpressed by transient transfection ( Morin and Gilmore , 1992 ; Cressman and Taub , 1993 ; Arenzana-Seisdedos et a/. , 1997 ) .
Also , in Hela cells , a nuclear localization of IxB « associated to NF-xB complexes has been demonstrated suggesting a regulation of xB-dependent transcription by IxBa « at the nuclear level ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et al. , 1995 ) .
The presence of nuclear exporting sequences ( NES ) in the IxBa molecule has been described indicating a potential role for IxBa « in the mechanisms of protein transport between nucleus and cytoplasm ( Fritz and Green , 1996 ; Arenzana-Seisdedos et al. , 1997 ) .
Furthermore , it has been recently demonstrated that upon microinjection of IxB « in Xenopus oocyte nuclei or overexpression of the protein by transient transfection in mammalian Nuclear localization of IxB « in T-lymphocytes T Lain de Lera et al 1582 cells , nuclear IxBa « disrupts NF-xB/DNA binding and promotes active transport of NF-xB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et al. , 1997 ) .
All these findings together with recent in vitro experiments ( Tran et al. , 1997 ) strongly suggest that , in addition to its regulatory role by retention of NF-xB complexes in the cytosol , IxBa « could act as a 'terminator ' of NF-xB dependent transcription in the nucleus .
Paradoxically , despite the key role played by NF-KB in the expression of immune-response associated genes and HIV replication , very little is known about the regulation of NF-xB and IxBa « in normal , peripheral blood T lymphocytes ( Kang et al. , 1992 ; Ghosh et al. , 1993 ; Lai and Tan , 1994 ) .
This question remains a critical matter in the comprehension of IxBa function in vivo because as we have previously demonstrated for HIV-LTR transactivation ( Alcami et al. , 1995 ) the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation are very different in normal cells and transformed cell lines .
To get a better insight into the potential role of nuclear IxBa in a physiological context we analysed the expression of IxBa and IxB & « /NF-xB complexes in the nucleus of normal T lymphocytes .
Our results demonstrate the presence of IxB « in the nucleus of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes by different approaches and open the possibility that this localization could be relevant in the regulation of NF-xB at the nuclear level .
Results IxBx is expressed in the nucleus of human T lymphocytes Nuclear and cytosolic extracts from purified T lymphocytes were analysed for IxBa « expression by Western blotting using a specific monoclonal antibody against IxBa ( 10B ) ( Jaffray et al. , 1995 ) .
As shown in Figure la , IxBa was detected in the cytosol of resting T lymphocytes .
After PMA activation , a transient decrease in IxBa « levels was observed in the cytosol at 30 min , followed by return to basal levels 12 h after cell activation .
Low levels of IxBa were detected in the nucleus of resting T lymphocytes ( Figure 1b ) but in contrast with the kinetics observed in cytosol in which IxB « decreases quickly after cell activation , a progressive increase in IxBa « levels was detected in the nucleus of PMA-activated human T lymphocytes .
The raise in nuclear IxBa « levels was maximal 2 h after PMA stimulation and was maintained up to 6 h ( data not shown ) .
After this time nuclear IxB « levels decreased and a return to basal levels was seen 12 h after activation .
Although some variability on IxBa « induction was observed among the different experiments the levels of IxB « in the nucleus of PMA-activated cells were consistently higher than IxBa levels in resting cells .
The range of nuclear IxBa « induction 2 h after PMA activation was between two- and tenfold as compared to non-activated lymphocytes .
IxBa concentrations in nucleus and cytosol were assessed by densitometry in films exposed for the same time and from these measurements we can conclude that in resting lymphocytes nuclear IxB « concentration is about 5-10 % of cytoplasmic concentrations .
In activated cells , 2 h after PMA activation similar amounts of IxB « were found in the cytosol and the nucleus ( Figure la and b ) .
Similar results were obtained using a different rabbit polyclonal antisera against IxBa ( Matthews et al. , 1993 ) ( data not shown ) .
Detection of nuclear IxB « was not due to cytosolic contamination in nuclear cell extracts .
Several methods of extraction and cell-fractionation were tested in preliminary experiments to rule out cytosolic contamination of nuclear proteins .
Nuclear extracts were systematically checked for potential contamination using antibodies directed against two different proteins of exclusive cytosolic location : lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and p105 .
As shown in Figure 1¢c , both proteins were undetectable in the nucleus of T lymphocytes thus excluding cytosolic contamination of the nuclear fraction .
Nuclear IxB « is detected by microscopy in human T lymphocytes To confirm the nuclear expression of IxBa by different techniques , IxBa « localization was analysed by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy techni- a.

As observed in Figure 2 , IxB « was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of resting human T lymphocytes .
After PMA activation , a sharp increase in IxBa levels was observed in the nuclear compartment .
Two different antibodies against IxBa were used with similar results ( not shown ) .
Confocal microscopy experiments were further confirmed by immunogold staining and electron microscopy analysis ( Figure 3 ) .
Labeling with a specific IxBa monoclonal antibody ( 10B ) and immunogold particles clearly showed the presence of IxBa in the nuclei of PMA-activated cells .
The distribution of nuclear IxBa « in activated lymphocytes did not appear homogeneous throughout the nucleoplasm but the precise nature of the accumulation of IxBa area has not been determined .
Kinetics of IxBx degradation and synthesis in human T lymphocytes To get a better insight into the kinetics of IxBa « synthesis and degradation , T lymphocytes were treated with cycloheximide ( CHX ) 1 h before activation .
As shown in Figure 4a , in the presence of CHX , cytosolic IxB « was undetectable 1h after PMA activation .
Therefore , rapid degradation and/or translocation of cytosolic IxBa « were induced by T cell activation .
In the absence of CHX treatment , IxBa « levels were continuously detected in the cytosol thus demonstrating the induction of de novo IxBa « synthesis early ( 30 min ) after PMA stimulation as has been shown in many other cell systems .
However , nuclear IxBa ( Figure 4b ) was still detected in the presence of CHX and persistence of the protein was observed later after IxBa « disappeared from the cytosol .
These data suggest that in activated T lymphocytes the nuclear pool of IxBa « is very stable and , at least partially , independent of IxBa resynthesis .
Nuclear IxBx does not inhibit NF-xB/DNA interaction To define the potential inhibitory activity of nuclear IxB « on NF-xB , nuclear extracts from resting and PMA -activated human T lymphocytes were analysed in Figure 3 Detection of IxBa & in human T lymphocytes by electron microscopy .

As shown in Figure Sa , a binding complex previously a. IP pSO characterized by our group and others ( Kang et a/. , . , ae 1992 ; Pimentel-Muifios et al. , 1994 ; Alcami et al. , 1995 ) 65 as p50 homodimers was detected in resting T P » i.- .

In activated cells , two more complexes PMA __- __+ _ - + composed of p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel heterodimers were N C induced as previously described ( Pimentel-Muifios et b IP p50 al. , 1995 ; Moore et al. , 1995 ) .
In parallel ( Figure 5b ) j P nuclear IxBa levels increased after PMA activation and this increase was not apparently associated with an inhibition of NF-xB binding .

An important question was to define whether or not NF- PMA _- __+ __ : * xB complexes could be inhibited by IxBa « or were N C protected from interaction with nuclear IxB « .

complexes was detected only in the nucleus and cytoso Longer exposure of the membranes did not yield detection of of activated T lymphocytes ( Figure 6d ) ; these results IxBa in nuclear extracts correlate with the fact that c-Rel is not constitutively expressed in unstimulated PBLs ( Pimentel-Muifios et al. , 1995 ; Moore et al. , 1995 and our unpublished observations ) .
When p50 or p65-immunoprecipitated complexes were analysed by Western blot with a specific IxBa « monoclonal antibody ( 10B ) no association of IxBa with p50 or p65 proteins could be detected in the nucleus of both resting and activated T lymphocytes ( Figure 6b and c ) .
In contrast , IxBa was clearly detected in the cytosol of resting and activated T lymphocytes associated to p50 and p65 proteins ( Figure 6b and c ) .
As shown in Figure 6e , c-Rel was associated with IxBa « in the cytosol of PMA-activated cells but was not bound to IxB « in the nucleus of either resting or activated T lymphocytes .
IxBB is not detected in the nucleus of human T lymphocytes As it has been described that could associate with NF-xB thus preventing its association with IxBa , nuclear and cytosolic extracts from purified T lymphocytes and Jurkatt cells were analysed for IxBB expression by Western blotting using a specific monoclonal antibody against IxBB ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
As shown in Figure 7 , IxBRB was only barely detectable in the cytosol of resting human T lymphocytes but not in the nucleus of either resting or PMA -activated T cells .
Discussion According to current models , IxB « would remain exclusively in the cytoplasm thus preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-xB .
However , IxB « has also been described in the nuclear compartment under different experimental conditions in which the protein is overexpressed either in vitro by transient transfection ( Morin and Gilmore , 1992 ; Cressman and Taub , 1993 ) or in vivo in transgenic p65 mice ( Perez et al. , 1995 ) .
Furthermore , following TNF activation IxBa « has been detected in the nuclear fraction of Hela cells ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et al. , 1995 ) associated with Rel/ NF-xB complexes .
Here we have addressed this question in primary human T lymphocytes because in this cell type NF-xB is an essential regulatory element in the control of immune response and HIV replication ( Alcami et al. , 1995 ; Pimentel-Muifios et al. , 1995 ; Chen et al. , 1997 ) .
In this report we demonstrate that IxBa shows a nuclear localization in resting and PMA Jurkatt cells PMA _ - + = + = + = + Figure 7 IxB # is not present in the nucleus of T lymphocytes .
Western blot analysis of cytosolic ( C ) and nuclear ( N ) extracts from purified T lymphocytes and Jurkatt cells was performed using an IxB # monoclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Cells were activated ( + ) or not ( - ) with PMA Nuclear localization of IxB « in T-lymphocytes T Lain de Lera et al activated peripheral blood human T lymphocytes by three different techniques : Western blot , confocal microscopy and electron microscopy .
The kinetics of IxBa synthesis and degradation in T lymphocytes was analysed by Western blot in CHX-treated cells .
PMA activation leads to a rapid degradation of IxBa in cytosolic extracts together with a resynthesis of the protein early after cell activation ( Figures la and 4a ) .
This kinetics has been previously described in many other cell types and confirms that IxBa degradation is also a major mechanism involved in activation-dependent NF-xB translocation in human T lymphocytes ( Lai and Tan , 1994 ; Harhaj et al. , 1996 ) .
Although some variations were observed among different experiments , the lowest level of cytosolic IkBa was observed 2 h after PMA treatment followed by a return to basal levels 12 h after cell activation as a consequence of protein resynthesis .
In contrast , in the nucleus of normal human T lymphocytes barely detectable levels of IxBa « were found by Western blot in resting cells whereas PMA activation quickly induced nuclear expression of IxBa « ( Figure 1b ) ( between two-and ten-fold depending on the different experiments ) .
Interestingly , IxB « levels remain stable in nuclear extracts from activated T lymphocytes treated with PMA in the presence of CHX ( Figure 4b ) .
Therefore , IxBa « persists in the nucleus in the absence of protein synthesis and in spite of continuous cell activation .
These results were observed using both a monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal rabbit antisera against IxBa whose specificity has been previously shown ( Matthews et al. , 1993 ; Jaffray et al. , 1995 ) .
The expression of nuclear IxB « was further verified by immunostaining using both confocal and electron microscopy techniques ( Figures 2 and 3 ) thus confirming the data shown in Western blot experiments .
A major question arising from the detection of IxBa « in the nucleus was to define whether IxBa expressed in this compartment was in an 'active ' form , able to inhibit NF- « xB binding as it has been previously shown in Hela cells ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et a/. , 1995 ) and in in vitro transcription experiments ( Tran et al. , 1997 ) .
To address this question , binding assays were done at different times after PMA activation .
Unexpectedly , DNA binding of p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel heterodimers was not affected despite of the high levels of nuclear IxBa « detected in the same nuclear extracts by Western blot ( Figure Sa and b ) .
However , in nuclear extracts of PMA -activated T lymphocytes recombinant IxBa was able to disrupt the binding of either p50/p65 or p50/ c-Rel complexes to DNA ( Figure 5¢ , right panel ) .
This latter result is specially relevant as it shows that , in contrast to recombinant IxB « , 'natural IxB « is expressed in the nucleus of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes in an inactive form , unable to disrupt NF-xB binding from DNA in PMA-activated cells .
These results were further confirmed in immunoprecipitation experiments in which no association between IxBa « and p50 , p65 or c-Rel proteins was found ( Figure 6b , c and e ) .
Immunoprecipitation experiments correlated with the kinetics of expression of Rel/NF-xB proteins .
In particular , it has been shown that p50 and p65 NF-xB subunits are constitutively expressed in the cytosol of resting T-lymphocytes but in contrast c-Rel is induced de novo by lymphocyte activation ( Alcami et al. , 1995 ; 1585 Nuclear localization of IxB « in T-lymphocytes T Lain de Lera et al 1586 Pimentel-Muifios et al. , 1995 ; Moore et al. , 1995 and our unpublished observations ) .
All these complexes are translocated to the nucleus following cell activation as shown in bandshift ( Figure 5 ) and immunoprecipitation experiments ( Figure 6 ) .
It has been suggested that newly formed p50/c-Rel complexes are particularly resistant to inactivation by newly synthesized IxBa « ( Moore et al. , 1995 ; Ghosh et al. , 1998 ) .
Our data are compatible with this hypothesis because in the cytosol the amount of IxBa « that co-precipitates with p50 is lower in activated lymphocytes as compared to resting cells .
These results suggest that p50/c-Rel complexes generated after cell activation are easily translocated to the nucleus as compared to p50/p65 dimers that would be more sensitive to cytosolic retention by newly synthesized IxBa « .
However , in nuclear extracts recombinant IxB « is able to disrupt the binding of either p50/p65 or p50/c-Rel complexes to DNA ( Figure 5c , right panel ) , thus excluding that nuclear p50/c-Rel complexes are resistant to inactivation by IxBa .
In resting lymphocytes low IxBa levels were detected in the nucleus as compared to the cytosol compartment .
From densitometry measurement of Western blot autoradiographs exposed for the same time we could estimate that IxB « concentration in the nucleus of resting cells was about 5-10 % of the levels found in the cytosolic compartment .
However , similar concentrations of IxBa were found in the nucleus and the cytosol 2 h after PMA activation .
These results show that in activated T lymphocytes nuclear IxBa is easily detected thus making unlikely that the lack of inhibition of NF-xB binding to DNA could be due to the presence of insufficient amounts of IxB « .
Furthermore , using confocal microscopy techniques , IxB « detection was particularly intense in the nucleus of PMA-activated lymphocytes .
These data suggest that methods used in the preparation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins could result in leakage of unbound IxBa « from the nucleus to the cytosol thus underestimating the levels of nuclear IxBa found in Western blot experiments .
The discrepancies found between our results and those previously described in activated Hela cells in which NF-xB/IxBa complexes were detected ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et al. , 1995 ) could be related to the cell type and the different stimuli used .
In fact , in Hela cells active IxB « was found in the nucleus only when transient stimuli as ILl or a TNF pulse were used whereas persistent cell activation leads to IxBa « degradation and permanent NF-xB translocation .
In our system , T lymphocytes were stimulated with PMA which induces a strong activation leading to prolonged translocation of NF-xB ( Pimentel-Muifios et al. , 1995 ) .
The expression of unbound IxBa « in the nucleus of PMA-activated human T lymphocytes may be due to different reasons : IxBa « could be post-traductionally modified making the protein unable to bind to NF-xB and resistant to degradation as it has been described for cytosolic IxBa « ( Imbert et al. , 1996 ) .
In agreement with this hypothesis , recombinant IxB « was highly efficient to inhibit DNA binding of Rel/NF-xB proteins in bandshift assays ( Figure 5c , right panel ) .
Work in progress in our laboratory is currently analysing the post-traductional modifications of the nuclear forms of IxBa « a found in T lymphocytes .
Another possibility to explain the incapacity of IxBa « to retain NF-KB in the nucleus could be the presence of other proteins interacting either with NF- « xB or IxBa « .
In particular , it has been described that IxB/ # , another member of the IxB family , can associate with NF-xB thus blocking its interaction with IxBa ( Suyang et a/. , 1996 ) .
In addition IxBB has been found in the nucleus associated to NF-xB but permitting DNA binding of p50/p65 heterodimers ( Suyang et al. , 1996 ) .
However , our results did not show any detection of IxB # in the nucleus of normal human T lymphocytes ( Figure 7 ) thus excluding the possibility that IxBB could be involved in the inhibition of NF-xB/IxBa « a association in the nucleus of human T lymphocytes .
Finally , we can not exclude the interaction between IxBa « and a yet unidentified protein in the nucleus .
This interaction would block the association between NF-xB and IxBa « and , on the other hand , would stabilize IxBa « thus protecting this molecule against proteolysis in the nucleus .
This mechanism would be overcome if large quantities of IxBa « are expressed in the nucleus .
In agreement with this hypothesis , we have observed that when overexpressed in T lymphocytes by transfection up to 90 % of the transiently expressed IxBa localizes to the nucleus .
In these experiments a close correlation between nuclear IxB « levels and inhibition of LTR transactivation and HIV replication is observed ( Lain de Lera et al. , manuscript in preparation ) .
These preliminary results argue against the possibility that IxB « could act as a transcriptional activator as previously suggested ( Morin and Gilmore , 1992 ) .
Our data show that IxBa localizes to the nucleus upon lymphocytic activation and in contrast with its role in the cytosol , it is apparently devoid of any inhibitory function .
Further work is needed to understand the functional role of nuclear IxBa « in human T lymphocytes .
Materials and methods Cell culture Jurkatt is a CD4* T cell line .
Human mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood of healthy donors by centrifugation in Ficoll-Hypaque ( Whitaker ) .
T lymphocytes were purified by passing through a nylon fiber wool column ( Robbins Scientific ) .
The purity of the enriched T cell population was always above 95 % .
Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium ( Whitaker ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Whitaker ) , glutamine and antibiotics ( penicillin and streptomycin ) .
Preparation of cytoplasmatic and nuclear extracts Purified T lymphocytes were treated or not with 25 ng/ml of PMA ( Sigma ) at 37°C in culture medium at different times .
When cycloheximide ( 10 ug/ml ! )
( Sigma ) was incorporated into the cultures , it was added 1 h before the onset of PMA activation and was maintained throughout the culture period .
After culture for the indicated times , cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer ( A ) during 5 min as described ( Bachelerie et al. , 1991 ) .
After removal of the supernatant to prepare cytosolic extracts , the nuclear pellets were resuspended in washing buffer ( B ) ( same composition as lysis buffer without Triton X-100 ) centrifuged at 4000 g for 3 min and washed .
After careful removal of the supernatant nucleic pellets were resuspended and maintained in permanent agitation for 30 min at 4°C in 100 wl of elution buffer ( C ) ( Bachelerie et a/. , 1991 ) .
Nuclear fractions were recovered after centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min .
Cytosolic proteins were extracted in the same procedure as nuclear extracts after lyse of the cells with buffer A .
The resultant supernatant containing cytosolic proteins was treated by adding 15 % glycerol and 1 % NP-40 .
Gel retardation assay Three ug of nuclear and cytosolic extracts were analysed as described ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et a/. , 1995 ) using a « P-dCTP labeled double-stranded synthetic wild type HIV enhancer oligonucleotide S'-AGCTTACAAGGGACTTT-CCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGA-3 ' .
Binding competition was assessed by pre-incubating the extract with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide and specific antibodies : p50 , p65 , c-Rel or recombinant IxB « ( kindly provided by RT Hay ) .
Western blot Ten ug of nuclear or cytosolic proteins were separated on a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel , transferred to nitrocellulose membrane ( PVDF , Sigma , USA ) .
Probing of the membranes was done with the following antibodies : monoclonal IxB « ( 10B ) which recognizes an epitope located between amino acids 24 and 48 of IxBa ( Jaffray et al. , 1995 ) , rabbit polyclonal IxBa « ( Matthews et al. , 1993 ) , rabbit polyclonal p50/p105 ( all kindly provided by RT Hay ) polyclonal « -LDH ( kindly provided by R Bravo ) and polyclonal c-Rel ( kindly provided by N Rice ) .
The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology : rabbit polyclonal p50 ( NLS , se-114 ) , rabbit polyclonal p65 ( C-20 , sc-372 ) and rabbit polyclonal IxBR ( G-20 , se-944 ) .
Antigen-antibody interactions were revealed using a chemiluminescence detection kit ( Amersham ) .
In all experiments performed the membranes were exposed from 5 min to 1 h to ensure full detection of the proteins .
The exposure time that is shown for Western blot figures of IkB « , IkBB and LDH is 1h .
Autoradiographs were scanned and analysed using the 'Diversity one ' software ( Pharmacia ) .
Immunoprecipitation Four hundred ug of cytosolic and nuclear proteins were incubated with 10 ug of different antibodies and maintained with agitation for 2 h at 4°C .
Thirty ul of protein A-Sepharose beads ( Calbiochem , USA ) were added and incubated overnight at 4°C .
After centrifugation , beads were washed six times with RIPA buffer .

Nuclear localization of IxB « in T-lymphocytes T Lain de Lera et al tated proteins were analysed by Western blot as described previously .
Confocal microscopy Isolated T lymphocytes were attached to poly-L-lysine coated coverslips , fixed for 10 min in 2 % paraformalde-hyde , 0.1 % glutaraldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 for 10 min .
Monoclonal antibody against IxB « ( 10B ) was applied for 30 min , followed by a 30 min incubation with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG ( Jackson Laboratory ) .
Coverslips were mounted in Moviol ( Hoechst ) .
Confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis were performed with a TCS4D confocal microscope based on a DM microscope interfaced with a mixed gas argon-krypton laser ( Leica Laser Technik ) .
Fluorescence acquisitions were performed with the 488 nm laser lines to excite FITC dye with a x 100 oil immersion PL APO objective .
Cells stained with control antibodies ( mouse IgG , Coulter ) and an FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG did not give detectable signal in the conditions described .
Electron microscopy T cells , stimulated as indicated at a density of 2 x were fixed in a solution of paraformaldehyde 4 % and glutaraldehyde 0.025 % for 10 min at room temperature .
Pellets were then dried and included in Lowicryl K4M for cutting .
Cuts were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against IxBa « using as secondary antibody a rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated with gold particles 15 nm diameter ( BioCell ) .
Uranile acetate and lead citrate was used for electron density staining .
