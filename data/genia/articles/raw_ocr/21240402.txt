HEMATOPOIESIS Functional correction of FA-C cells with FANCC suppresses the expression of interferon y-inducible genes Sara R. Fagerlie , Jane Diaz , Tracy A. Christianson , Kelli McCartan , Winifred Keeble , Gregory R. Faulkner , and Grover C. Bagby Because hematopoietic cells derived from Fanconi anemia ( FA ) patients of the C-complementation group ( FA-C ) are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of interferon y ( IFNy ) , the products of certain IFNy-inducible genes known to influence hematopoietic cell survival were quantified .
High constitutive expression of the IFNy-inducible genes , IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma subunit ( ISGF3y ) , IFN regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) , and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21W4 '' !
was found in FANCC mutant B lymphoblasts , low-density bone marrow cells , doxically , these cells do not activate signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 1 properly .
In an attempt to clarify mechanisms by which FA-C cells overexpress IFNy-inducible genes in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation , it was reasoned that decreased levels of activated STAT1 might result in reduced expression of a hematopoietic IFNy-responsive protein that normally modulates expression of other IFNy-responsive genes .
Levels of the IFNy-inducible factor IFN consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP ) , a negative trans-acting regulator of some IFNy-inducible genes , were quantified .
ICSBP levels were reduced in FA-C B lymphoblasts and MEFs .
However , enforced expression of ICSBP failed to down-regulate IRF-1 , ISGF3y , and p21W '' .
Thus , the FANCC protein functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic inhibi-tion , but it does so independently of the classic IFN-STAT1 pathway and is not the direct result of reduced ICSBP expression .

Para- Introduction ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Fanconi anemia ( FA ) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive bone marrow failure , multiple congenital anomalies , and a high incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia . ''
Cells from FA patients are hypersensitive to the effects of DNA cross-linking agents , such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane . ''
The disorder is genetically heterogeneous , with at least 7 different complementation groups . ''
The genes corresponding to group A ( FANCA ) , C ( FANCC ) , E ( FANCE ) , F ( FANCF ) , and G ( FANCG ) have been cloned . '' '' ''
Fanconi gene sequences show no significant homology to any known genes , and the functions of their gene products are Hematopoietic precursor cells from children with FA of the C complementation group ( FA-C ) are excessively apoptotic and hypersensitive to a variety of cytokines known to induce apoptosis , including interferon y ( IFNy ) .
IFNy is a cytokine involved in host defense against viral infections and regulation of cell growth. ! ''
IFNy clearly plays a role in hematopoietic suppression and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acquired aplastic ane-mia . ''
Cells with inactivating FANCC mutations are hypersensitive to the apoptotic effects of IFNy , an effect that depends in part on an intact fas/fas-ligand pathway . ''
Specifically , exposure to low doses of IFNy in vitro primes a substantial fraction of FA-C progenitor cells to undergo apoptosis after subsequent exposure to fas ligand .
Such doses of IFNy have no effect on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells .
`` > > Because of the influence of IFNy on the fas pathway , we sought to determine whether other IFNy-inducible genes are hyperactive in FA-C cells .
We carried out studies designed to analyze expression of IFNy-inducible genes known to promote apoptosis and/or mitogenic inhibition in hematopoietic progenitor cells .
We describe here studies revealing that the transactivators interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma subunit ( ISGF3y ) and the cyclin-dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitor p21 WA* '' are expressed at constitutively higher levels in FA-C B lymphoblasts , low-density bone marrow cells ( LDBMCs ) , and murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , compared with cells expressing a normal FANCC .
However , these proteins are expressed at normal levels in mature mutant fibro-blasts , suggesting some degree of tissue or developmental stage specificity of FANCC function in control of these genes .
IFNy exerts its effects , at least in part , through the Jak/signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) signaling path-way , '' '' '' '' However , FA-C cells are defective in their ability to properly activate STAT1 .
`` ° We show here that up-regulation of IFNy-inducible genes occurs precisely in those cell types that fail to properly activate STAT1 .
For this reason , we hypothesized that loss of a STAT1-inducible transcriptional repressor may result in up-regulation of IFNy-inducible genes in FA-C cells .
Indeed , we found expression of the transcriptional repressor IFN consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP ) is decreased in both FA-C B lymphoblasts and murine embryonic fibroblasts .
However , enforced expression of ICSBP failed to suppress IRF-1 , ISGF37y , or p21 WAFL , From the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology , the Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics , and the Oregon Cancer Center , Oregon Health Sciences University ; and the Molecular Hematopoiesis Laboratory , VA Medical Center , Portland , OR .

3018 _ FAGERLIE etal We conclude that in FA-C hematopoietic and embryonic cells , expression of IFNy-inducible genes is increased even in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation but is not linked directly with reduced levels of ICSBP .

Results Constitutive overexpression of IFNy-inducible genes in mutant FA-C cell lines Because FA-C cells are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of IFNy , '' we quantified protein levels of transcriptional activators known to be downstream of the IFNy/Jak/STAT pathway by immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates or nuclear extracts .
Analysis of the IFNy-inducible transactivating factors IRF-1 and ISGF37y consistently revealed high constitutive expression levels in nuclear extracts and whole cell lysates derived from the FancC mutant MEF cell line ( MEF61 ) compared with the wild-type ( WT ) MEF cell line ( MEF11.1 ) .
We observed the same phenomenon using ( 1 ) whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts from the EBV-transformed FANCC mutant human B-lymphoblast line HSC536N ; ( 2 ) nuclear extracts from the EBV-transformed B-lymphoblast line PD149 , relative to levels in those cells corrected for the defect by retroviral transduction of the normal FANCC cDNA ( Figure 1A ) ; and ( 3 ) whole cell lysates from LDBMCs derived from FA patients compared with LDBMCs derived from a normal person ( Figure 1D ) .
In addition , we have previously found constitutively high expression of IRF-1 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) also occurs in diploid bone marrow cells from children with FA-C but not in normal bone marrow cells .
However , no differences in IRF-2 expression levels were found between FA-C cells and normal cells ( Figure 1A ) .
In addition , mRNA levels of the IFNy-inducible guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) MxA are reduced in the HSC536N B-lymphoblast line compared with corrected cells ( Figure 1B ) .
We found no differences in IRF-1 and ISGF3y expression in the FA-A lymphoblast line HSC72 ( Figure 1C ) .
We next quantified levels of the cell cycle modulator p21 WA '' '' , which is known to be induced by IRF-1 and FA-C B lymphoblasts , MEFs , and LDBMC 's express high levels of p21 WA* '' !
compared with normal or corrected cells ( Figure 1A , D ) .
The FA-A cell line HSC:72 also expresses higher levels of p21W '' '' compared with corrected cells , but does not overexpress IRF-1 or ISGF3y ( Figure 1C ) .
This suggests that overexpression of the transactivators IRF-1 and ISGF3y and of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 YA '' may Figure 1 .

The FANCC mutant B-lymphoblast line HSC536N , the HSC536N line transduced with a vector only ( HSC536N/neo ) , and PD149 ( lanes 4 , 6 , and 7 , respectively ) show increased IRF-1 , and expression compared with the normal cell line JY ( lane 3 ) and with cells corrected for the defect by retroviral transduction of the FANCC cDNA ( HSC536N/FANCC ) ( lane 5 ) or PD149/FANCC ( lane 8 ) .

3020 - FAGERLIE etal be due to abnormalities in different pathways , one of which is influenced by both FANCA and FANCC and the other by FANCC alone .
We found no differences in p53 binding to its p21 binding site ( data not shown ) and minimal differences in p53 expression levels , indicating that p21W '' '' overexpression is p53-independent ( Figure 1A ) .
No differences in expression levels of the cdk inhibitor p27 '' were found ( Figure 1A ) .
We found no differences in protein levels of IRF-1 , ISGF3Yy , and p21W '' '' in mature primary human FA fibroblasts ( Figure 2 ) .
Finding molecular differences between mature fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells is not surprising given that hematopoietic abnormalities represent the dominant phenotype in FA patients .
In addition , finding that a normal FANCC is required for proper regulation of IRF-1 , p21W* '' '' , and ISGF3y in hematopoietic cells and embryonic fibroblasts but not in mature fibroblasts suggests that MEFs have retained more plasticity and may exhibit responses more reflective of hematopoietic and germ cells than adult fibroblasts .
FA-C cells overexpressing IFNy-inducible genes are deficient in STAT1 phosphorylation FA-C cells have been shown to be defective in STAT 1 phosphorylation , despite having normal activation of the IFNy receptor , JAK 1 , and JAK2 .
`` ° We sought to determine if this occurred in cells that overexpress IFNy-inducible genes and those that do not .
We analyzed the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 in IFNy-induced cells .
MEFs were serum starved for 24 hours and then incubated at 37°C with 1 ng/mL of murine IFNy for the indicated time periods .
Using immunoblot analysis , we determined that in both total cell lysates and nuclear extracts from MEFs , the level of phosphorylated STAT1 was significantly decreased in FancC mutant cells compared with the WT cells .
When these blots were stripped and reprobed for total STAT1 , levels of total STAT1 were equivalent ( Figure 3A ) .
In addition , analysis of total cell lysates from the mutant FANCC B-cell lines HSC536N and HSC536N/neo demonstrated that the amount of phosphorylated STAT1 was diminished when compared with the normal cell line JY and the FANCC-transduced cell line HSC536N/FANCC .

STAT1i phosphorylation at tyrosine 701 is reduced in MEFs and B lymphoblasts .
( A ) Immunoblot analysis demonstrates that phosphorylation of STAT1 is reduced in both nuclear extracts and total cell extracts ( upper and middle panel respectively ) from FancC/~ MEFs ( MEF61 ) ( lanes 5 through 8 ) compared with WT cells ( MEF11.1 ) ( anes 1 though 4 ) following stimulation with 1 ng/mL IFNy for the indicated times .
Total STAT1 levels ( lower panel ) were equivalent ( lanes 1 through 4 compared with lanes 5 through 8 ) .
( B ) Phosphorylation of STATA ( upper panel ) is reduced in total cell extracts from HSC536N ( lanes 3 and 4 ) and HSCS536N/neo ( lanes 7 and 8 ) compared with JY ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and HSC536N/FANCC ( lanes 5 and 6 ) following stimulation with 1 ng/mL IFNy at 37°C for 15 minutes ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) .
Total STAT1 levels were slightly higher in the mutant cells ( but phosphorylation levels are reduced ) ( lower panel ) .
decreased ) ( Figure 3B ) .
However , STAT1 phosphorylation was found to be normal in all mature human FA fibroblast lines tested ( Figure 4 ) .
Thus , in FA cells , STAT1 phosphorylation defects are specific to certain cell types , and paradoxically , those cell types defective in STAT1 activation have high constitutive expression of several IFNy-inducible genes .
Reduced binding to the GAS element in FA-C cells It was theoretically possible that a more complete and rapid nuclear translocation of STAT1 in FA-C cells might have given an appearance of reduced STAT1 activation .
Consequently , we asked whether apparently reduced levels of STAT 1 phosphorylation were associated with increased binding to the STAT1 response element , GAS .
Using an oligonucleotide derived from the GAS element of murine IRF-1 for electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) analysis of murine MEF lines , we found that IFNy-inducible binding to the GAS element was significantly reduced in the FancC-~- MEF line compared with the WT MEF line ( Figure 5A ) .

Immunoblot analysis of human FA-C fibroblasts by means of an antibody specific for phosphorylated STAT1 demonstrates that STAT1 is phosphorylated equivalently between mutant and corrected IFNy-stimulated cells ( 1 ng/mL IFNy ) ( top panel ) .
In addition , total STATA is expressed at approximately equal levels ( bottom panel ) .

BLOOD , 15 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 10 IFNy-inducible binding was not detectable in mutant FANCC human B cells , whereas normal inducible binding was observed in the FANCC-complemented cell line ( Figure 5B ) .
These results indicate that the diminished ability to phosphorylate STAT1 in FA-C cells results in decreased activated STAT1 nuclear translocation and binding to GAS .
Expression of the IFNy response modulator ICSBP is reduced in the FA-C cell lines Seeking to identify potential molecular points of control involved in the aberrant expression of IRF-1 , and ISGF3y in FA-C cells , we quantified ICSBP , an interferon-responsive transcription factor known to modulate IFN responses in hematopoietic cells .
`` `` '' > ICSBP levels were constitutively low in HSC536N and HSC536N/ neo cell lines compared with the normal cell line JY and the complemented line HSC536N/FANCC ( Figure 6A ) .
In addition , although ICSBP is reported to be expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells , we found ICSBP expression to be consistently inducible in WT MEFs as well .
Expression of ICSBP is significantly decreased in FANCC mutant MEFs .
Therefore a functional FANCC is necessary for optimal constitutive expression of ICSBP .
In addition , we find reduced binding to the GAS element derived from murine ICSBP ( Figure 6B ) , suggesting that decreased ICSBP expression may be a direct result of reduced STAT 1 phosphorylation .
Enforced expression of ICSBP does not suppress IRF-1 , p21WAFV/CP1 , or |SGF37y To examine the linkage of reduced ICSBP with overexpression of IRF-1 , ISGF3y , or p21W '' '' , we transduced the HSC536N B-lymphoblast cell line with a retroviral vector carrying the human ICSBP cDNA .
Although these cells express high levels of ICSBP , ICSBP expression failed to suppress the expression of IRF-1 , p21 *** , or ISGF3y ( Figure 7 ) .
In fact ; expression of IRF-1 was slightly increased in cells expressing ICSBP .
Therefore , up-regulation of IRF-1 , ISGF3y , and p21 WA '' '' is not directly linked to reduced ICSBP expression .

Discussion Interferons are involved in a broad range of mammalian biological functions , including immunity , inflammation , hematopoiesis , cell proliferation , and differentiation .
'* ' '' In hematopoietic progenitor cells , IFNy induces apoptosis , '' '' * '' % 4 '' and there is compelling indirect evidence that it plays a pathophysiologically significant role in acquired aplastic anemias .
`` `` '' '' 2~ ' Because FA-C cells are hypersensitive to IFNy , '' > ** we believe that IFNy hypersensitivity and bone marrow failure may be linked in FA .
Accordingly , we have focused our attention on the IFNy signaling pathway in FA-C cells as a way of deciphering the function of the FANCC protein in modulating the apoptotic response to extracellular cues .
The effects of IFNy are mediated , at least in part , through transcriptional regulation of downstream genes , which include members of the IRF family of transcription factors .
We find that certain IRF family members are constitutively overexpressed in specific FA-C cell types compared with normal cells .

Enforced expression of ICSBP fails to down-regulate IRF-1 ISGF3y or p21W4 '' ! .
Immunoblot analysis of FA-C B lymphoblasts HSCS36N ( lane1 ) , HSC536N transduced with the human ICSBP cDNA ( HSCS36N/ICSBP ) ( lane2 ) , and HSC536N transduced with vector alone ( HSCS36N/neo ) ( lane 3 ) demonstrates that HSC536N/ ICSBP are expressing high constitutive levels of ICSBP , but this expression fails to suppress IRF-1 , ISGF3y , or p21 WA '' .
B lymphoblasts , MEFs , and patient LDBMCs , is of particular interest because it is the only protein of the IRF family known to complex with STAT molecules . ''
ISGF3qy exerts its transcriptional activation only in conjunction with STAT1 and STAT2* and plays a crucial role in the regulation of IFN-B gene expression , '' a finding of relevance because some researchers have suggested that the induced expression of IFN-B is required for the hematopoietic suppressive effects of IFNy .
* '' IRF-1 is required for carrying out the apoptotic effects of IFNy signaling .
The ratio of IRFl to IRF2 expression is important for proper cell cycle control . '' ''
IRF-1 expression is significantly increased in FA-C hematopoietic and embryonic cells , but no differences in IRF-2 expression levels were found ( Figure 1 ) , upsetting the proper balance of IRF-1 and IRF-2 levels in FA-C cells .
IRF-1 also cooperates with p53 to induce expression of the cdk inhibitor Although equivalent p53 expression levels were found between FancC-'~ MEFs and FancC* ' '' * MEFs and only minimal differences in p53 expression were found in human FA-C B lymphoblasts compared with normal cells , FA-C cells expressed significantly greater amounts of p21 YA '' !
( Figure 1 ) .
There was no difference in p53 binding to its p21 WA '' -binding site ( data not shown ) , and expression of the IRF-1 independent edk inhibitor p27° '' '' was equivalent ( Figure 1 ) .
Thus , it is possible that IRF-1 up-regulation contributes to the overexpression of p21WA '' ' .
However , given that we find high constitutive in FA-A cells and that these cells do not overexpress IRF-1 , it is more likely that up-regulation of p21WA '' ' and the IRF BLOOD , 15 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 10 transactivators may be due to abnormalities in different pathways , one of which is influenced by both FANCA and FANCC or the entire FA complex and the other by FANCC alone .
In addition to IRF-1 , ISGF3y , and p21 W* , others have found that IFNy-inducible GTPase , MxA , which confers intracellular antiviral activity in IFN-induced cells , '' '' is also constitutively expressed in FA cells , '' '' a finding we confirm here ( Figure 1B ) .
Thus , several IFNy-inducible factors that are important in regulation of apoptosis and mitogenic inhibition are constitutively upregulated in FA-C cells in a cell-type-specific manner .
Surprisingly , though FA-C hematopoietic and embryonic cells ( 1 ) are hypersensitive to the mitotic inhibitory effects of IFNy and ( 2 ) express constitutively high levels of several IFNy-inducible genes ( effects abrogated by transduction of normal FANCC cDNA ) , activation of STAT 1 is impaired . '' ''
We sought to determine if loss of STAT1 activation occurs only in those cell types exhibiting high constitutive expression of IFNy-inducible genes .
We found STAT1 phosphorylation to be defective in FA-C B lymphoblasts and MEFs , but not in mature human fibroblasts ( Figures 3 , 4 ) .
Because mature human fibroblasts do not overexpress these genes , we reason that the overexpression of IRF-1 , ISGF3y , and p21WA '' !
occurs only in FA-C cells defective in their ability to activate STAT1 .
Up-regulation of these genes in these cells appears to require that ( 1 ) FANCC be inactivated and ( 2 ) the particular FANCC mutation suppress STAT1 activation .
Therefore , constitutive expression of IFNy-responsive genes in FANCC mutant cells is due to either ground-state activation of a pathway that does not require STAT1 phosphorylation or loss of a hematopoietic IFNy-responsive protein that normally modulates expression of other IFN-responsive genes .
One IFNy-responsive modulator of interest to us was the transcriptional repressor ICSBP , a member of the IRF family expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells . ''
ICSBP interacts with both IREF-1 and IRF-2 in vitro and in vivo and inhibits the DNA-binding activity of ISGF3y . '' ''
ICSBP binds to IRF-1 and suppresses some IFNy-induced gene responses . ''
Stable expression of the DNA binding domain of ICSBP blocks IRF-1 transactivation and also inhibits binding of STAT1 to GAS . ''
In FANCC mutant B lymphoblasts we found less ICSBP expression than normal cells ( Figure 6 ) .
In fact , ICSBP is the only IFNy-inducible protein of those we have tested that is reduced in FA-C cells .
Surprisingly , ICSBP is also expressed in an inducible manner in MEFs , and this expression is significantly reduced in FancC mutant MEFs .
We first hypothesized that low expression levels of ICSBP in FA-C cells may be a direct result of a deficiency in STAT1 phosphorylation in FA-C cells .
Indeed , STAT1 binding to the GAS element from ICSBP is significantly reduced in FA-C cells ( Figure 6 ) .
Because ICSBP is decreased in those cells with up-regulated IFNy-inducible genes , we next reasoned that loss of ICSBP contributes to the up-regulation of these genes .
However , enforced expression of ICSBP into these cells failed to down-regulate IRF-1 , ISGF3y , or p21 '' W4 '' ' ( Figure 7 ) .
Therefore , up-regulation of these IFN y-inducible factors in FA cells is not directly linked with reduced ICSBP expression levels .
FA cells , both in vitro and in vivo , are not hardy .
They grow slowly and have a high apoptotic fraction . ''
Studies in our laboratory have focused , in large part , on clarifying molecular determinants of the death pathways in FA cells and on beginning to establish an ordered relationship of these death pathways to discrete FA proteins .
We have identified roles for the fas/fas-ligand pathway , '' caspases 8 and 3 , '' and the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase . '' ''
In this work , although we can not yet clarify the cause , it is clear that even without being exposed to BLOOD , 15 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 10 environmental cues for apoptosis or mitotic arrest , at a gene-expression level , FA-C cells act as if they have been stimulated by From www .

In view of the apoptotic and mitogenic inhibitory activities of these proteins , we suggest that they contribute to the characteristic apoptotic phenotype in FA bone marrow cells and may contribute to the IFN-hypersensitive phenotype by specifically setting ground-state levels of these proteins that are higher than those in normal cells .
Clarification of the signaling pathways by which aberrantly expressed genes are controlled in FA-C cells should lead to an understanding of why such cells are References 10 .
