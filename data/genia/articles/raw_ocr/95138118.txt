1261-1268 , 1995 Printed in U.S.A. Two Distinct Signalling Pathways Are Involved in the Control of the Biphasic jun B Transcription Induced by Interleukin-6 in the B Cell Hybridoma 7TD1* ( Received for publication , October 11 , 1994 ) Roger Rezzonico , Gilles Ponziot , Agnes Loubat , Dominique Lallemand $ , Amanda Proudfoot1 , and Bernard Rossi From INSERM U364 , Faculté de Médecine , Avenue de Vallombrose , 06107 Nice Cedex 02 , France We have measured the level of junB mRNA in the B hybridoma cell line 7TD1 , under interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) stimulation .
IL-6 increases junB mRNA in a biphasic fashion .
The first early-induced peak was transient and likely corresponds to the well documented typical junB mRNA , stimulated in response to numerous growth factors , including IL-6 .
At variance , the second peak which has never been reported previously , lasted several hours .
As a consequence of its effect on junB mRNA , IL-6 stimulated , in a biphasic fashion , the nuclear accumulation of the JunB protein .
In this study , we demonstrated that IL-6 regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of junB mRNA and JunB protein can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of junB transcription .
Furthermore , our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late IL-6-induced junB transcription waves .
First , cycloheximide strongly potentiated the transcription of the second wave , whereas it failed to affect the early-induced burst .
Second , tyrphostin , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , impaired the expression of the first but not the second junB mRNA peak .
Conversely , genistein , another tyrosine kinase inhibitor , totally abolished the expression of the second peak of jun B mRNA whereas it did not affect the expression of the first peak .
Altogether these data indicate that , in 7TD1 cells , IL-6 controls junB transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways .
Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is a cytokine which plays an important role in a wide range of biological activities including B cell differentiation , acute phase response to injury and inflammation ( 1-4 ) , T cell activation , and neuronal cell and macrophage differentiation ( 5-8 ) .
It has also been described to promote the growth of some murine hybridoma and plasmocytoma ( 9-11 ) , as well as human myeloma ( 12 ) .

* The abbreviations used are : IL-6 , interleukin-6 ; genistein , 4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone ; tyrphostin 25 ( RG50875 ) , ( 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzi-lidene ) -malononitrile ; NF-IL-6 , nuclear factor IL-6 ; MOPS , 4-morpho-linepropanesulfonic acid .
ways involved in the mediation of these various effects remain to be elucidated .
The IL-6 receptor is composed of an 80-kDa ligand-binding subunit associated with a 130-kDa ( gp130 ) sig-nal-transducing moiety ( 13 , 14 ) .
gp130 contains a large intra-cytoplasmic domain lacking homology with any known protein kinases or other proteins carrying a catalytic activity .
Upon binding , the ligand mediates the dimerization of gp130 and the activation of one tyrosine kinase belonging to the Janus kinase family ( Jak1 , Jak2 , or Tyk2 ) ( 15-17 ) .
In response to IL-6 , several transcription factors are activated ( 18-25 ) .
Along this line , factors involved in the regulation of acute phase protein genes have been investigated ex-tensively .
The transcription factor referred to as nuclear factor NF-IL-6 ( C/EBP $ ) was initially identified as a factor that binds to the AGATTGCACAATCT consensus sequence encompassed within the IL-6 promoter ( 26 ) .
This factor was involved in the induction of several class 1 acute phase protein genes ( a « ; -acid glycoprotein , angiotensinogen ... ) by IL-6 ( 23 ) .
NF-IL-6 is ubiquitous , inducible at the transcription level , and the resulting protein is activated by phosphorylation on threonine residues by microtubule associated protein kinase ( s ) ( 27 ) .
Besides NF-IL-6 , IL-6 also stimulates the activity of two other factors involved in the transcription of the class 2 acute phase protein genes ( a , -macroglobulin , « ; -antichymotrypsin .
.
.
) .
They have been identified as IL-6 response element binding protein ( 18 , 19 ) and acute phase response factor/stat-3 ( 20 , 25 , 28 ) .
IL-6 response element binding protein is produced in an activated state several hours after the addition of IL-6 , by a mechanism involving protein neosynthesis ( 19 ) .
In contrast , the activation of acute phase response factor/stat-3 does not require protein synthesis , since this factor is directly phosphorylated by the Jak family protein tyrosine kinase and translocated in the nucleus within minutes following IL-6 stimulation ( 16 ) .
Several reports have also demonstrated that IL-6 triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 160-kDa protein that controls in turn the early activation of jun B mRNA ( 29 , 30 ) , one possible component of the transcription factors AP-1 ( 31 ) or NFAT ( 32 ) .
Under IL-6 stimulation , the transcription of early jun B is controlled by another transcriptional factor , that interacts with an IL-6-specific cis-regulating element ( JRE-IL-6 ) located at position -149 to -124 of junB promoter ( 83 ) .
This factor is activated by a H7-sensitive pathway that does not involved protein kinase C , protein kinase A , or microtubule associated protein kinases ( 33 ) , suggesting that this IL-6 signaling pathway is different from those evoked for acute phase response factor/ stat-3 or NF-IL-6 .
In this respect , the study of the regulation of junB provides an interesting approach for investigating novel IL-6-dependent pathways .
In the present report we demonstrated that besides its ability to induce early junB , IL-6 can also stimulate a second delayed and sustained wave of expression of junB mRNA .
This 1261 1262 biphasic increase corresponds to two transcriptional bursts , resulting subsequently in a biphasic increase of the junB-en-coded protein ( JunB ) .
We also provided evidence that the two waves of junB are regulated by two separated pathways that are controlled by distinct tyrosine kinases .

Time course of induction by interleukin-6 of junB and e-mye mRNAs .
Growing 7TD1 cells were synchronized by IL-6 deprivation and restimulated with the cytokine for the indicated times .
Total RNAs were prepared , loaded on agarose gels , blotted onto nylon membrane , and hybridized as described under `` Materials and Methods '' with cDNA probes encoding for , respectively , junB and c-myc .
Panel A shows the densitometric scanning of Northern blot experiments of IL-6-induced jun B mRNA .
Panel B shows the level of junB ( upper part ) and c-myc ( lower part ) mRNA estimated by Northern blot analysis , as well as the level of ribosomal 18 S RNA visualized by ethidium bromide as a control of the total RNA level .

Expression and Purification of a Bacterially Synthesized Glutathione S-Transferase-JunB Protein and Immunoblotting-This protein was derived from a pGEX-4T vector ( Pharmacia ) into which the 1.4-kilobase junB cDNA , encoding for the full-length protein , was cloned into Smal Xhol sites .
Isopropyl-1-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside ( 1 mM for 6 h ) treatment of bacteria harboring this plasmid grown at 28 °C , induced the expression of soluble 66-67-kDa protein comprising glutathione S-transferase ( 26-28 kDa ) fused with the 39-kDa JunB , respectively .
Following lysis by sonication , solubilization with 1 % Triton X-100 and centrifugation to remove debris , the protein was absorbed on ice to glutathione-Sepharose ( Pharmacia Biotech ) .
The beads were then washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 0.5 m NaCl .
The 39-kDa JunB protein was finally eluted from the column by cleavage with 1 ug/ml human thrombin for 1 h at 25 °C .
The protein ( 50 ng ) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon mem-brane .
Immunoblotting was performed as described above with an anti-JunB ( JunB 2.2 ) antibody .
RESULTS JunB mRNA Is Stimulated in a Biphasic Fashion in Response to IL-6 on 7TD1 Cells-The jun family members junB and c-jun are usually transiently stimulated in the early response to numerous stimuli including IL-6 ( 29 , 30 , 39 ) .
In recent reports , authors have demonstrated that , besides their early effect on c-jun mRNA , effectors like thrombin or fetal calf serum are also able to elicit a second phase of c-jun mRNA induction ( 40 , 41 ) .
In an attempt to verify whether IL-6 was also able to stimulate a late induction of junB mRNA in 7TD1 cells , we measured the level of junB mRNA within the 10 h following the addition of IL-6 .

Kinetics of induction by interleukin-6 of nuclear JunB protein .
IL-6-deprived 7TD1 cells were stimulated with IL-6 for the indicated times .
Nuclear proteins ( 100 ug ) were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Immunoblots were then probed either with a specific anti-JunB antibody or a non relevant serum ( N.1.S . )
and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) revelation .
Panel A shows the biphasic induction by IL-6 of the nuclear JunB protein .
Panel B shows the comparative migration pat tern of : the nuclear JunB protein of 7TD1 cells , nonstimulated ( lane 2 ) or stimulated ( Zane 3 ) for 1 h with IL-6 versus a nonphosphorylated bacterially expressed JunB fusion protein ( lane 4 ) .
Lane 1 shows nu clear proteins of 7TD1 cells stimulated with IL-6 , probed with a non-relevant serum .
< 4 JunB © < 4 JunB strongly augmented the cellular level of jun B mRNA following a bimodal fashion .
The first peak of induction reached a maximal value after 1 h and then rapidly declined after 2 h of stimulation in the presence of IL-6 .
The second phase which was more sustained occurred between 5 and 9 h after stimulation .
The stimulation factors estimated by scanning the bands corresponding to junB mRNA were , respectively , around 13-fold for the first peak and 4- to 5-fold for the second peak ( Fig .
1 , panel A ) .
This biphasic increase was selective since IL-6 did not stimulate or modify the constitutive level of c-myc in the same interval of time ( Fig .
1 , panel B ) The Biphasic Stimulation of junB mRNA Is Associated with a Biphasic Increase in JunB Protein-To determine whether the biphasic regulation of junB mRNA resulted in a biphasic accumulation of JunB protein , we have assessed , by Western blotting analysis , the JunB protein level in nuclear extracts from 7TD1 cells stimulated with IL-6 ( 100 units/ml ) for 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 h. Results are shown in Fig .
2 , panel A .
In IL-6-deprived cells , no immunoreactive JunB protein could be de-tected .
The level of protein increased markedly when IL-6 was added , raised a maximal level after 1 h , before declining to a basal level at 4 h. Then the protein level increased again by 6 h , suggesting that the biphasic stimulation of jun B mRNA was accompanied by the increase of the nuclear JunB protein .
It is currently accepted that the phosphorylation of c-Jun is responsible for its electrophoretic retardation from 39 kDa to 46 kDa ( 42 ) .
In an attempt to define the phosphorylated status of the nuclear IL-6-translocated JunB protein , we have compared the migration pattern of the protein present in 7TD1 nuclear extracts with that of a nonphosphorylated bacterially expressed fusion protein .
Lanes 2 and 3 , Panel B represented the stimulation by IL-6 of the nuclear JunB protein .
As indicated , JunB migrated as an unique band with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa slightly higher than the bacterially expressed protein ( 39-40 kDa ) ( lane 3 versus lane 4 ) suggesting , by analogy with results observed on c-Jun , that IL-6 might stimulate the nuclear trans-location of a phosphorylated form of JunB .

Transcriptional induction of junB and c-mye genes in isolated nuclei of 7TD1 cells exposed to IL-6 .
Quiescent 7TD1 cells were exposed to IL-6 ( 100 units/ml ) for the indicated times .
Nuclei were isolated , and [ a-*P ] JUTP was incorporated into nascent RNA chains as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Labeled RNA ( 10 '' cpm ) was then hybridized for 48 h to 5 ug of jun B ( panel B ) or e-mye cDNA ( panel C ) immobilized on nitrocellulose filters .
After washing , filters were exposed to x-ray film for 1 day .
Panel A represents the densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms hybridized with jun B ( ] ) and c-myc ( EI ) cDNAs , respectively .
crease of the two jun B mRNA peaks , run-on experiments were performed to first determine whether IL-6 controlled the transcriptional rate of this gene .
Nascent nuclear RNA chains , biosynthetically labeled with [ a-°P ] UTP , were isolated from 7TD1 cells stimulated for 0 to 10 h with IL-6 and used to hybridize nitrocellulose filters previously spotted with plas-mids containing either c-myc or jun B inserts .
Results concerning junB transcription are shown in Fig .
3 , panel B .
In accordance with previous results ( 30 ) , a very low but detectable constitutive level of junrB transcription was measurable in 7TTD1 cells deprived of IL-6 for 24 h. After the addition of IL-6 , junB transcripts increased abruptly to reach a maximal value at 30-60 min , before declining to the basal value by 2-3 h. Interestingly , the transcription resumed after 5 h and peaked at 6 h , before declining again by 8-9 h. The stimulatory factors , as determined by scanning the spots corresponding to the neo-synthesized junB transcripts , were , respectively , 8-fold for the early peak ( maximum at 30 min ) and 4-fold for the second peak ( maximum at 6 h ) ( Fig .
3 , panel A ) .
The biphasic time course of the burst in the transcription rate is an original feature that probably accounts for the immediate and delayed increase in junB mRNA levels .
In contrast with junB transcription , e-mye gene was constitutively transcribed in noninduced 7TD1 cells and was not further stimulated in the presence of IL-6 ( Fig .
3 , panel C ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that the biphasic transcription burst , described here , is not a general IL-6-mediated phenomena since it does not concern other genes like c-myc .

Effect of IL-6 on the stability 1 % * of the early junB mRNA peak .
Quies- g 4 cent 7TD1 cells were stimulated with IL-6 E2 for 1 h , and the level of junB mRNA was a ~ 2 measured during the next 3 h , by North- 4 ern blot analysis , either in the presence of IL-6 ( panel B ) or after the transcription 0 was blocked by : IL-6 withdrawal ( panel 1 C ) , actinomycin D addition ( panel D ) , or both IL-6 removal and addition of actinomycin D ( panel E ) .
On panel A are represented the densitometric scanning of the Northern blot analysis presented in panels B , C , D , and E , referred , respectively , as [ ] , M , O , and @ .
IL-6 Does Not Modify the Stability of junB mRNA-In order to further examine the effect of IL-6 on the stability of the two waves of junB mRNA , 7TD1 cells were treated with IL-6 ( 100 units/ml = 500 pg/ml ! )
for 1 or 6 h , then exposed to actinomycin D ( 5 ug/ml ) .
The decay of RNA was followed afterward in the presence of IL-6 or after withdrawal of the cytokine .
Northern blot analyses are shown in Fig .
4 , panels B , C , D , and E ( early peak ) , and Fig .
5 , panels B , C , D , and E ( late peak ) .
The corresponding densitometric RNA level quantifications are presented in panel A of Figs .
4 and 5 .
Regardless of the presence of the cytokine or actinomycin D , the first burst of transcription was shut off after 60-90 min , and junB mRNA decayed with the same half-life ( about 40-50 min ) .
These data demonstrate that IL-6 exclusively controlled the transcription step without any modification of junB mRNA stability .
When the transcription was blocked by actinomycin D , 6 h after the addition of IL-6 , junB mRNA decayed with the same time course ( half-life about 40 min ) , whatever the presence or absence of IL-6 in the medium ( Fig .
5 , panels D and E ) , suggesting that IL-6 did not control the stability of the second peak of junB mRNA .
Concerning the second wave of junB transcription , it is interesting to notice that as soon as IL-6 was removed junB mRNA decayed rapidly ( Fig .
5 , panel C ) indicating that IL-6 withdrawal led to a rapid arrest of jun B transcription .
Thus , at variance with the first peak of junB RNA , IL-6 was permanently required to sustain jun B transcription during the second wave .
Cycloheximide Potentiated the Effect of IL-6 on the Second but Not on the First junB mRNA Peak-Studies were carried out to investigate whether inhibition of protein synthesis might influence the early and/or late junB transcription and mRNA stability .
Quiescent cells were stimulated with IL-6 for 1 or 6 h , in the presence or absence of cycloheximide ( 10 ug/ml ) , and then treated with or without actinomycin D ( 5 ug/ml ) after which the junB transcription and mRNA level were followed for 4 h. The results demonstrated that the level of the early-induced junB mRNA was identical in cells treated with or without cycloheximide ( not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
6 , panel B , when the transcription was blocked by actinomycin D , cycloheximide did not modify the time course of junB mRNA decay ( about 40 min as estimated by quantitating the RNA level by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram , panel A ) suggesting that protein synthesis is neither required for the synthesis nor for Effect of IL-6 on junB Transcription and Synthesis O +1L-6 E -iL-6 O +1-6 + acrp C @ - IL-6 + Act .

In a parallel run-on experiment , we also demonstrated that cycloheximide did not modify early IL-6-induced jun B transcription ( data not shown ) .
Our observation is in agreement with previous results from Nakajima and Wall ( 30 ) on the MH6O BSF-2 cell line .
At variance , it differs from the results obtained by Lord et al .
( 29 ) on the myeloid cell line M1 .
On this model , these authors demonstrated that cycloheximide stabilized junB mRNA by decreasing its degradation .
The situation was different when we looked to the effect of cycloheximide on the induction of the second jun B mRNA wave .
Indeed , in the presence of cycloheximide , the level of the late-induced jun B mRNA measured after 6 h of IL-6 was 15-20-fold higher than that measured without protein synthesis inhibitor ( Fig .
7 , panel A ) .
To approach the mechanism of this superin-duction , we measured IL-6-stimulated junB transcription by run-on experiments , after exposure for 6 and 8 h of the cells to IL-6 , in the absence or in the presence of 10 ug/ml cyclohexi-mide .
Clearly , cycloheximide potentiated the IL-6-stimulated junB transcription rate to an extent that matched mRNA accumulation ( Fig .
7 , panel B ) .
To investigate a possible combined effect of cycloheximide and actinomycin D on jun B mRNA stability , we blocked cellular transcription with actinomycin D , 6 h after the addition of IL-6 and cycloheximide , and measured jun B mRNA decay .
As shown in Fig .
7 , panel C , we found that the time course of junB mRNA shut-off , determined by Northern blot analysis after the addition of actinomycin D and quantified by densitometric scanning ( right part of panel C ) , was not modified in the presence of cycloheximide , compared to Fig .
5 , panel D , confirming that the effect of this drug is consistent with a sole increase of the junB transcription rate and did not lie on increased junB mRNA stability .
In contrast with results obtained on junB mRNA , cycloheximide does not potentiate but rather inhibits e-mye mRNA expression ( not shown ) .
Tyrphostin and Genistein Inhibited , Respectively , the Early-and the Late-induced junB mRNA Wave-As described by others ( 29 , 30 ) , induction by IL-6 of the early junB mRNA requires activation of tyrosine kinase ( s ) .
However , to date , no study has been reported concerning the induction of the late-induced junB mRNA level .
In an attempt to clarify this question , we have tested the effect of one of the tyrphostins ( 25 , RG50875 ) and of genistein , two potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors , on the induction of both early- and late-induced jun B mRNA in 7TD1 Effect of IL-6 on junB Transcription and Synthesis 1265 A B 8 Fic .

inhibitor , did not affect the early-induced jurnB mRNA peak but , interestingly , abolished the expression of the second wave , suggesting that , similarly to the early-induced peak , the activation of the delayed junB mRNA also required activation of a tyrosine kinase .
Taking together the present results suggested that IL-6 triggered two distinct tyrosine kinase activities that controlled expression of the early- and late-induced junB mRNA , respectively .
DISCUSSION Interleukin-6 is responsible for various biological effects such as inflammation and growth of myeloma or hybridoma cells .
To date , the mechanisms underlying IL-6 effects are a matter of intense research .
In an attempt to gain information on molecular events involved in IL-6 mitogenic action , we have used the mouse B hybridoma cell line 7TD1 , which is IL-6-dependent for survival and proliferation , and studied the regulation by this cytokine of junB , a cellular oncogene acknowledged to be closely related to the control of cell growth ( 43-45 ) .
junB is a typical early and transiently activated oncogene , inducible by a wide variety of stimuli that elicit diverse biological functions ( 29 , 30 , 39 , 46-48 ) .
We report here that , in 7TTD1 cells , IL-6 stimulated junrB mRNA in a biphasic fashion .
The first peak presented a sharply transient aspect while the second rise in junB mRNA was more sustained .
The IL-6 effect was specific of junB , since c-myc that was constitutively expressed at high levels in this biological model was not further stimulated in the presence of the cytokine .
We demonstrated by the means of run-on experiments that the two peaks in junB mRNA resulted exclusively , in both cases , from an increase in the transcription rate , without any effect on mRNA stability .
The induction of the immediate jun B mRNA early peak culminated at 30-60 min and rapidly declined to the basal value , by 2 h. It is noteworthy that the declining phase presented the same time course regardless of the presence of IL-6 in the medium .
This shut-off mechanism was specific for junB since during the same time span c-myc transcription remained un-affected .
Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not modify the kinetic profile of this IL-6-induced early peak of Effect of IL-6 on junB Transcription and Synthesis junB mRNA .
These data suggest that the start and the arrest of junB transcription during this process were not dependent on the synthesis of new factors , but rather stem from post-translational modifications of factors pre-existing to the addition of the cytokine .
The situation observed following the second peak of junB mRNA was different in the sense that , intriguingly , cycloheximide strongly potentiated the IL-6-stimulated junB transcription rate .
Thus , our data are in agreement with the occurrence of a constitutive jun B transcriptional repressor which specifically regulates the second wave of junB mRNA synthesis .
This observation is in accord with a previous report showing a superinduction effect of cycloheximide on junB under fetal calf serum or growth factor , like fibroblast growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor , stimulation on mouse fibroblasts ( 39 , 47 ) .
It is noteworthy that the presence of such a repressor was only detectable during the onset of the second wave of transcription which would mean that its activation requires de novo protein synthesis occurring after the first peak of junB mRNA .
As demonstrated by the experiments using actinomycin D , the prolonged expression of junB mRNA during the second phase was due to a sustained transcription activity that was itself strictly dependent on the permanent presence of IL-6 .
In contrast with the first peak 's features , no deactivation in transcriptional activity was observed during the second wave of transcripts , provided that IL-6 was present in the medium .
Furthermore , the declining phase that occurred after 8-9 h did not result from an IL-6-driven deactivation mechanism , but rather reflected the fact that cells entered into S phase during which transcriptional activity is largely de-creased .
In fact , addition of aphidicoline that impedes cells to reinitiate their DNA replication program maintained the maximal level of junB transcripts during the second peak , all along the time this drug was present in the incubation medium ( not shown ) .
Recent advances have demonstrated that the early induction of junB correlates with phosphorylation of a p160 protein by a still unidentified tyrosine kinase ( 29 , 30 ) .
In this report we found that two kinds of protein tyrosine kinases were involved in the complex control of junB under IL-6 stimulation .
A tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase controlled the onset of the early transient expression of jun B , whereas a genistein-sensi-tive tyrosine kinase was involved in the control of the more sustained second peak of junB mRNA .
Owing to the discriminative action of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors , we may postulate that two distinct pathways regulate the expression of the two waves of jun B , that are each under the control of a defined tyrosine kinase .
The discriminatory effect we observed on 7TD1 cells between these two compounds is not an original feature .
For example , on NIH3T3 cells , tyrphostin ( RG50864 ) and genistein exert discriminative inhibitory effects on the epidermal growth factor-stimulated pathways leading to the activation of either microtubule associated protein kinase ( 49 ) or p7OS6 kinase ( 50 ) .
Likewise , discriminative inhibitory effects among tyrphostin congeners have been reported for epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER1 ) and newErB2 ( HER2 ) which share 80 % sequence homology in the kinase domain ( 51 ) .
Tyrphostins can also discriminate between p140** '' , p185° '' '' '' '' '' , and p210®°~ @ * in vitro although these receptor species only differ in their sequence ( 52 ) .
Since such a discrepancy exists among tyrphostins , it is likely to expect that differences might exist between the action of genistein and tyrphostin .
In this respect , combination of different tyrosine kinase inhibitors might be useful to dissect different aspects of the IL-6 response .
Our data give clues to investigate whether the repressor factor that negatively regulated the increase in transcription Effect of IL-6 on junB Transcription and Synthesis rate of the second peak was dependent of the occurrence of the first peak of junB mRNA .
Indeed , the pattern of expression of the second wave of transcripts was not significantly modified in the presence of tyrphostin that abolished the first jun B mRNA peak .
One can thus conclude that the synthesis of a repressor factor , acting during the second peak , was not dependent on JunB protein molecules that would have been encoded by early junB transcripts .
Taken collectively , these data highly suggest that the regulation of the two waves of junB are two separate events controlled by two distinct pathways .
Recently , the involvement of Jak congeners in the signal transduction mediated by IL-6 effects has been clearly established on different cell types ( 16 , 17 , 53 ) .
We are currently investigating a possible involvement of this family of tyrosine kinases in our model , especially in the mediation of junB expression .
Owing to the complex control that IL-6 exerts on jun B mRNA induction , we wished to know what was the fate of the JunB protein in the presence of the cytokine .
Interestingly , JunB protein was undetectable in nucleic fractions purified from nonstimulated 7TD1 cells but was strongly enhanced in presence of IL-6 .
As assessed by Western blotting experiments , the protein increased in a biphasic fashion that matched the biphasic increase of mRNA and the transcription rate .
The JunB protein encoded by the two waves of mRNA migrated as a monomer of 46 kDa which might correspond to the molecular mass of a phosphorylated form of the molecule , as compared with the migration pattern of the 39-kDa unphosphorylated recombinant protein .
This result then supposes that IL-6 not only increased the nuclear level of JunB but could also stimulate the phosphorylation of this protein .
On a mechanistic point of view , this observation is interesting .
In fact , it is now well accepted that the phosphorylation status of oncogene-encoded proteins like c-Fos , c-Jun , or JunB might control their binding activity ( 48 , 54-56 ) .
Experiments using recombinant JunB protein are currently in progress , aimed at clarifying the physiological role of IL-6-dependent phosphorylation on JunB binding and transactivating activities in 7TD1 cells .
To date , the main interest in the field of IL-6 action has focused on the characterization of intermediates involved in the generation and the propagation of early signals triggered by this cytokine .
Using jwnB oncogene as a molecular reporter , we could demonstrate that , besides its early action , IL-6 also stimulates mid/long term events .
By the use of cycloheximide and tyrosine kinase inhibitors we were able to reveal two distinct signaling routes that end up with the expression of a same molecular event , namely JunB expression .
Indeed , the control of the two peaks of jun B mRNA differs on three major points : ( i ) activation of a repressor protein that intervened only in the control of the transcription rate occurring during the second peak , ( ii ) the presence of IL-6 impeded the decrease in the second burst of transcription rate whereas the presence of the cytokine had no effect on the onset of the declining phase of the first peak , ( iii ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors allowed us to hypothesize that two distinct protein tyrosine kinases control each of the two peaks of IL-6-induced junB transcripts .
In conclusion , our data provide interesting tools to approach the mechanisms by which jun B could participate in the mediation of IL-6 biological effects .
