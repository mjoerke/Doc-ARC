11 Late Gene Expression from the Epstein-Barr Virus BcLF1 and BFRF3 Promoters Does Not Require DNA Replication in cis TRICIA R. SERIO , ' JOHN L. KOLMAN , 't anp GEORGE MILLER** > * Departments of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , '' Pediatrics , '' and Epidemiology and Public Health , '' Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06520 Received 30 April 1997/Accepted 18 July 1997 Late gene expression follows and is dependent upon lytic replication of the viral genome .
Although experimental evidence is lacking , lytic viral DNA replication is believed to remove modifications or binding factors from the genome which serve to repress late gene expression during latency or the early lytic cycle .
We have developed a reporter assay to begin characterizing the mechanisms that regulate late gene expression in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
In this model system , the activities of late promoter-reporter fusions are measured following transient transfection into tissue culture cells expressing EBV during different stages of the lytic cycle .
This system faithfully recapitulates late expression patterns from the endogenous virus , implicating specific cis-active sequences in the control of late gene expression .
In addition , these promoters respond only indirectly to the viral immediate-early transactivator , ZEBRA .
This indirect response is mediated by other viral or virally induced activities downstream of ZEBRA in the lytic cascade .
In this system , late gene expression is sensitive to inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase such as phosphonoacetic acid , although the reporters lack a eukaryotic origin of replication and are not replicated under the assay conditions .
Thus , replication of the transcriptional template is not a prerequisite for expression with late kinetics , a finding inconsistent with the current models which posit a cis-active relationship between lytic EBV DNA replication and late gene expression .
Rather , analysis of this system has revealed a frans relationship between late gene expression and viral DNA replication and highlights the indirect and complex link between these two events .
The lytic cascade of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is divided into three phases of regulated gene expression , immediate early , early , and late ( 16 ) .
Synthesis of a single virally encoded transactivator , ZEBRA ( 3 , 4 ) , serves as a checkpoint for initiation of the replicative cycle .
This immediate-early protein directly or indirectly activates expression of early viral genes , many of which regulate lytic replication of the viral genome ( 16 ) .
Amplification of viral DNA , initiating at the lytic origin of replication ( 5 , 13 ) , defines the boundary between early and late gene expression ( 16 ) .
Structural proteins synthesized during the late phase are assembled into virions which package the viral DNA and are ultimately released as infectious particles ( 16 ) .
While events leading to the initiation of lytic replication of the viral genome have been extensively characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels , information regarding the regulation of late events in EBV infection is scarce .
Late gene expression is blocked at the protein and steady-state mRNA levels by inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase , BALFS ( 19 ) , such as phosphonoacetic acid ( PAA ) ( 24 , 27 ) , phosphonoformic acid ( 6 ) , and acyclovir ( 14 ) , suggesting a dependence upon the activity of BALFS and presumably lytic replication of the viral DNA .
In addition , the Raji cell line ( 22 ) , which contains a deletion in the virally encoded single-strand binding protein BALF2 ( 1 ) , is defective for lytic viral DNA replication and late gene expression ( 7 ) .
This link to viral DNA replication , however , appears to be independent of template methylation , as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase do not induce synthesis of late products in Raji cells ( 28 ) or HH514-16 cells ( 11 ) .
These observations suggest that late gene expression is subject * Corresponding author .

8726 to uncharacterized regulatory mechanisms which likely constitute an important checkpoint within the viral lytic cascade .
In an effort to characterize these mechanisms , we have designed a transient-transfection-based reporter assay for late gene expression in an EBV-infected human B-cell line , HH514-16 .
This assay faithfully reproduced late regulatory mechanisms in EBV-infected B cells .
The late promoters were active only in cell lines containing lytically replicating EBV and were not directly activated by ZEBRA alone in uninfected cell lines .
Based on the information obtained in these experiments , the relationship of late gene expression and viral DNA replication appeared to be more complex than the removal of repressive modification or binding proteins from the transcriptional template .
This assay has permitted us to analyze the cis regulation of late gene expression in detail ( unpublished data ) .

The blots were also probed with a 1.8-kb portion of B-actin cDNA .
Reporter assays .
Seventy-two hours after transfection and induction into the lytic cycle , cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline .
Cells were resuspended in 1 % reporter lysis buffer ( Promega ) at 8.1 x 10 % cells/pl .
The suspension was incubated at 25°C for 15 min and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 x g at 25°C for 15 s. The supernatant was removed to a new tube , and the pellet was resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer at 10° cells/5 pl .
Fifty-nine microliters of the supernatant was incubated at 60°C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous deacetylases .
A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assay ( 12 ) was then performed on this extract in 500 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.8 ) -0.5 mM acetyl coenzyme A-1 Ci of [ '*CJchlor-amphenicol at 37°C for 3 h. The [ **CJchloramphenicol was then extracted with 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate , spotted on thin-layer chromatography plates ( Baker Chemical Co. ) , and chromatographed ascending in chloroform-methanol ( 95:5 ) until the front reached the top of the plate .
The thin-layer chromatography plates were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film overnight , and the spots were quantitated by scintillation counting .

Pronase was added to a concentration of 1.25 mg/ml , SDS was added to 1.25 % , and the suspension was incubated at 60°C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 5 min , and 0.2 volume of 5 M potassium acetate was added .
Following a 20-min incubation on ice , the sample was spun at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min .

The blots were postwashed in 3 % SSC-0.1 % SDS-0.2 % Denhardt 's solution for 5 min at 65°C , in 3 % SSC-0.1 % SDS-0.2 % -NaPP ; for 1 h at 65°C , and in 0.3 % SSC for 20 min at 65°C .
Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 4 h. RESULTS Expression of reporter genes from late viral promoters requires an active viral DNA polymerase .
To characterize the regulatory mechanisms governing late gene expression in EBV , three viral promoters active during the EBV lytic cycle , name-ly , the major capsid antigen , BcLF1 , and the small viral capsid antigen , BFRF3 ( both of which are late promoters ) , and the early BMRF1 promoter for the viral DNA polymerase proces-sivity factor , were cloned upstream of the coding sequence for CAT on plasmids lacking eukaryotic origins of replication ( Fig .
1 ) .
The activities of these promoters were determined during the early phase or the late phase of the lytic cycle in a single EBV-positive cell line by adding or omitting , respectively , the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor PAA .
However , a transfection control with strong activity in both early- and late-expressing cells was necessary in order to compare the activities of a given promoter during these two stages .
We used a luciferase reporter under the control of the EBV latent promoter , Wp , for this purpose .
In HH514-16 cells induced with a combination of TPA and NB the luciferase activity from Wp was identical early , in the presence of PAA , and late , in the absence of PAA , in the lytic cycle ( Fig .
2 ) .
By cotransfecting this luciferase reporter with the lytic CAT reporters , we could control for transfection efficiency and , thus , compare the early and late activities of any lytic promoter .
The normalized activities of three lytic cycle promoters were determined in the early and late phases of the lytic cycle following transient transfection into HH514-16 cells ( Fig .
3A ) .
During the early lytic cycle in the presence of PAA , the activities of the late promoters , BcLF1 and BFRF3 , were identical to that of the vector control , pCAT Basic .
However , during the late phase of the lytic cycle , in the absence of PAA , both promoters strongly directed the expression of CAT .
The induction of late expression in each case was roughly 20-fold over the early activity ( Fig .
3A ) .
In comparison , the early BMRF1L promoter efficiently induced CAT expression in the presence of PAA , a stimulation of 20-fold over the vector control , pCAT Basic ( Fig .
3A ) .
This early activity was unaltered during the late phase ( Fig .
3A ) .
Expression of reporter genes mirrors expression from the corresponding endogenous viral gene .
CAT activity was compared with expression of the corresponding gene products from the endogenous virus by collecting total RNA for Northern analysis , total cellular lysate for immunoblotting , and protein extracts for reporter assays from each transfection into HH514-16 cells ( Fig .
3A ) .
Stable messages for the BeLF1 and BFRF3 gene products were detected only in the absence of PAA ( Fig .
3B , lanes 2 , 4 , and 6 ) .
In contrast , BMRF1 message was detectable in both the presence and absence of PAA ( Fig .
3B , lanes 1 through 6 ) .
These results were also apparent at the protein level ( Fig .
3C ) .
In all cases , reporter activities exactly mirrored expression of the corresponding endogenous viral gene in the same cells .
In addition , this assay did not affect expression from the endogenous viral genome ; the same viral gene products were expressed with the same kinetics regardless of whether the plasmid transfected contained an early or a late 8728 SERIO ET AL .

3B or C ; compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4 or 5 and 6 ) .
This reporter assay , therefore , faithfully mirrored lytic cycle expression patterns from the viral genome and was an accurate model for regulation of late gene expression .
Lytic cycle promoters are unresponsive to induction stimuli in the EBV-negative cell line BJAB .
Next , we determined whether the lytic cycle promoter activities observed in HH514-16 cells ( Fig .
3A ) were virus dependent and not a response to the pleiotropic cellular activation caused by TPA and NB .
The activities of these constructs were analyzed in the EBV-negative cell line BJAB .
As shown in Fig .
4 , the activities of the lytic cycle promoters , BcLF1 , BFRF3 , and BMRF1 , were comparable to that of the vector control in BJAB cells .
None of the lytic cycle promoters responded directly to treatment with TPA and NB in BJAB cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast , the HCMV minimal promoter , Basic + HMP ( Fig .
4 , right side ) , was strongly induced ( 20-fold ) by treatment with TPA and NB .
We conclude , therefore , that the lytic cycle promoter activities observed in HH514-16 cells were an indirect response to TPA and NB likely mediated by a viral or virally induced trans function .
Lytic cycle promoters drive stage-specific expression of reporter genes in response to ZEBRA in HHS14-16 cells .
We analyzed the activities of the late gene reporters in HH514-16 cells induced into lytic replication by ZEBRA expressed from a heterologous promoter in order to confirm that their expression was specifically dependent upon the lytic cycle of EBV .
The activity of Wp is repressed by the high levels of ZEBRA expressed from the heterologous promoter ( 15 , 26a ) and , therefore , was not suitable as an internal control .
Instead , a luciferase reporter driven by the SV40 minimal promoter , pGL2 Promoter , was used as a transfection efficiency and standardization control in these experiments .
The activity of pGL2 Promoter was unaltered by ZEBRA expression in the presence or absence of PAA in HH514-16 cells ( Fig .
5A ) .
The activities of the two late promoters , BcLF1 and BFRF3 , were strongly induced ( 24- and 45-fold , respectively ) by ZEBRA expression only in the absence of PAA , during the late phase of the lytic cycle ( Fig .
5B ) .
In contrast , the early BMRF1 promoter responded nearly identically to ZEBRA expression in both the presence and absence of PAA ( Fig .
5B ) , representing a 30- to 45 -fold induction relative to the vector control .
The levels of ZEBRA expression from the SV40 promoter were unaltered 5000 4000 2 3000 7 D E & S 8 , 2000 © $ < I 1000 7 ( Wpi1i6s FIG .

Comparison of expression patterns from lytic reporter constructs and the endogenous HHS14-16 virus .
( A ) Activities of BeLF1 CAT , BFRF3 CAT , BMRF1 CAT , and pCAT Basic in HH514-16 treated with PAA , TPA , and NB ( white bars ) or with TPA and NB ( T/NB ) alone ( gray bars ) .
Values are standardized to the luciferase activity from the cotransfected Wp1168 construct .
Values represent five separate transfections , and error bars indicate standard EBV LATE GENE EXPRESSION - 8729 by the presence of PAA ( Fig .
5C ) .
Since the BcLF1 and BFRF3 promoters responded identically to induction of the lytic cycle by either chemical manipulation ( Fig .
3A ) or heterologous ZEBRA expression ( Fig .
5B ) , their late behavior represented a direct response to the viral lytic cycle rather than a nonspecific stimulation by cellular factors affected by the inducing agents .
Late promoters are unresponsive to heterologous ZEBRA expression in the EBV-negative cell line BJAB .
The ability of ZEBRA to stimulate the activities of the lytic cycle promoters in the absence of other viral products was determined in the EBV-negative cell line BJAB .
The activity of the HCMV minimal promoter , as assayed by luciferase expression , was unaltered by the heterologous expression of ZEBRA in BJAB cells ( Fig .
6A ) and served as a control for these experiments .
The late promoters , BcLF1 and BFRF3 , did not respond to ZEBRA expression in BJAB cells and were completely inactive in contrast to the vector control , pCAT Basic ( Fig .
6B ) .
In contrast , the early BMRF1 promoter was stimulated 20-fold by the expression of ZEBRA in BJAB cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
Although the expression of ZEBRA was variable in this experiment ( Fig .
6C ) , in other experiments large amounts of ZEBRA , comparable to those in lane 4 , were never able to activate expression from the late promoters in BJAB cells ( data not shown ) .
Since ZEBRA expression was not sufficient to activate the late promoters in the absence of EBV , these promoters must have responded indirectly to ZEBRA expression in HH514-16 cells ( Fig .
5B ) , through another viral or virally induced function downstream of ZEBRA in the lytic cascade .
Late gene expression requires lytic viral DNA replication in trans but not in cis .
Characterization of this reporter system clearly demonstrated that late gene expression was controlled by specific cis-active regulatory sequences present in the BeLF1 and BFRF3 promoters and absent from the BMRF1 promoter .
Moreover , late gene expression was dependent upon a viral or virally induced function downstream of ZEBRA in the lytic cascade .
Since late gene expression from the viral genome is sensitive to inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase , replication itself was a strong candidate for the required activity .
Paradox-ically , the activities of BeLF1 CAT and BFRF3 CAT were also sensitive to PAA ( Fig .
3A and 5B ) , but these constructs lacked eukaryotic origins of replication .
Although the reporter constructs lack a eukaryotic origin of replication , we monitored the methylation state of the constructs following transient transfection as a marker for DNA replication to ascertain if a cryptic origin of replication was present .
BeLF1 CAT , BFRF3 CAT , BMRF1 CAT , and pCAT Basic DNAs , detected by Southern blotting for CAT se-quences , were sensitive to cleavage by Sau3AlI but resistant to cleavage with DpnII prior to transfection into HH514-16 cells ( Fig .
7A , top , lanes 1 and 2 , 7 and 8 , 13 and 14 , and 19 and 20 ) , indicating methylation at dam sites ( GATC ) .
Following transfection into HH514-16 cells , all constructs retained this methylation pattern and the corresponding sensitivity to Sau3AI and resistance to DpnII ( Fig .

This assay was sensitive enough to detect replication of a transfected plasmid containing the EBV lytic origin of replication , pBS + BamHI H , in the absence of PAA ( Fig .
7B , top , lane 5 ; compare lane 3 ) by probing for vector sequences within the bacterial f1 origin of replication following 4-h exposure to Kodak XAR film in the absence of an intensifying screen .
As a control , BeLF1 CAT DNA produced in a dam mutant strain of E. coli had identical sensitivity to DpnII and Sau3AI both before ( Fig .
7A , lanes 25 and 26 ) and after ( Fig .
7A , lanes 27 through 30 ) transfection into HH514-16 cells .
This assay effectively uncoupled DNA replication and late gene expression , implicating a trans tather than a cis dependence .
Raji cells do not support late gene expression from reporter constructs .
To examine the possibilities that late gene expression was dependent on a function of the DNA polymerase other than replication or that the activities of these reporter constructs were nonspecifically inhibited by PAA , their activities were analyzed in Raji cells , which were deficient in lytic viral DNA replication due to a deletion in BALF2 , the virally encoded single-strand binding protein ( 7 ) , but still expressed the viral DNA polymerase , BALF5 .
Although BcLF1 and BFRF3 CAT were induced approximately 2.5-fold by ZEBRA expression in Raji cells ( Fig .
8A ) , BMRF1 CAT was more highly induced ( roughly eightfold ) by ZEBRA expression in Raji cells ( Fig .
8A ) .
Relative to the vector control , BeLF1 CAT was induced 3.7-fold , and BFRF3 CAT was repressed 1.2-fold , in contrast to BMRF1 CAT , which was stimulated nearly 12-fold ( Fig .
8A ) .
This data was comparable to early levels in EBV LATE GENE EXPRESSION - 8731 120 .

Rabbit antiserum C was used to detect ZEBRA expression .
HH514-16 cells where BeLF1 CAT was 3.1-fold and BFRF3 CAT was 1.8-fold more active than the vector controls ( Fig .
5B ) .
The levels of ZEBRA expressed were comparable for each transfection ( Fig .
8B ; compare lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) .
This experiment circumvented the use of a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor and demonstrated that the late promoters did not respond to another activity of the viral DNA polymerase .
Taken together with the above results , this observation indicates late gene expression from cloned BeLF1 and BFRF3 promoters required lytic replication of the viral genome in trans but not in cis .
DISCUSSION We have developed a reporter assay which accurately recapitulated the late gene expression patterns of EBV in lytically infected cells .
This system eliminated the complications of cell line-specific effects , allowing a direct comparison of early and late activities within a single cellular background .
Expression from the endogenous virus , at both the RNA and protein levels , as well as replication of the viral genome served as internal controls for this system ( Fig .
3A and B and 7 ) .
Attempts to reproduce the control mechanisms regulating late gene expression in a reporter assay have never been successful in EBV ( 15 ) or any other virus .
Establishment of this system alone , therefore , has greatly increased our knowledge of the regulation of late gene expression .
This analysis of cloned viral promoters has generated insight into the cis regulation of late gene expression .

are intrinsically different from early promoters ( Fig .
3A and 5B ) , suggesting a regulation by specific cis-active sequences present in the late promoter fragments in these constructs ( Fig .
1 ) .
This functional difference between cloned viral promoters suggests that a specific late regulatory mechanism exists and that late gene expression does not result from nonspecific stimulation of transcription brought about by a global change in the basal machinery .
This assay may have provided insight into finer regulation of late gene expression in EBV .
For example , the BcLF1 late promoter directs low-level early expression of reporters in response to ZEBRA ( Fig .
5B and 8A ; 3.1-fold and 3.7-fold , respectively , compared to the vector control ) .
This activation is dependent upon the presence of EBV and is not a direct response to ZEBRA expression ( Fig .
6B ) .
In contrast , the BFRF3 late promoter does not direct early expression of CAT ( Fig .
5B and 8A , 1.8-fold and 0.8-fold , respectively , compared to the vector control ) .

late promoters point to possible substages of late gene expression during the lytic cycle of EBV as have been previously described for herpes simplex virus ( 25 ) .
This assay has also revealed preliminary information about the frans regulation of late gene expression in EBV .
Despite the presence of ZEBRA response elements in some late promoters ( 17 ) , ZEBRA likely stimulates the promoters ' activities through an indirect mechanism which requires other viral activities ( compare Fig .
5B and 6B ) .
The required frens activity may actually be lytic DNA replication itself , as expression with late kinetics is strictly dependent upon this event in frans ( Fig .
3A and 5B ; compare Fig .
6B and 8A ) .
The BcLF1 and BFRF3 promoters direct late expression in this system without alteration of the promoter itself by passage of a replication fork .
By contrast , a lytic origin of replication , oriS , is required in cis for expression from late promoters in herpes simplex virus ( 13a ) .
The widely accepted link between viral DNA replication and late gene expression in EBV is obviously more complex than previously thought .
A trans link between DNA replication and late gene expression in EBV is not a surprising result considering the infection cycle in B cells in vitro .
During latency , the viral genome replicates once per cell cycle from oriP ( 30 , 31 ) without expression of late products ; therefore , DNA replication in cis is not sufficient to induce late gene expression .
Rather , some unique EBV LATE GENE EXPRESSION - 8733 aspect ( s ) of lytic DNA replication must stimulate the expression of late products .
Comparison of latent and lytic replication of the EBV genome reveals a number of distinctive features of these two events .
Latent and lytic replication proceed from different origins ( 13 , 31 ) and are directed by different enzy-matic machineries ( 8 , 9 , 30 ) .
Latent replication occurs in cycling cells in the presence of few viral products , while lytic replication may occur in arrested cells ( 2 ) in the presence of immediate-early and early lytic products .
Finally , latent replication results in the production of episomal genomes , while lytic replication yields a 100- to 1,000-fold amplification of the viral genome in a linear form ( 13 ) .
These distinctions between latent and lytic replication likely form the basis of regulation for the expression of late products in trans .
Manipulation of the assay described here may lead to more precise understanding of this trans relationship in the future .
The trans stimulation of late gene expression by lytic viral DNA replication may occur by either an activation or antire-pression event .
In the activation model , lytic DNA replication in cis could induce the expression of a positive regulator of late gene expression , analogous to an immediate-early factor .
Al-ternately , lytic viral DNA replication in cis could induce the expression of an antirepressor .
This factor could potentially alleviate the active repression of late promoters through modification or protein-protein interaction .
Finally , amplification of the viral genome by lytic replication may serve to titrate a repressor from late promoters .
Further studies are required to discriminate between these models .
The information obtained through the establishment of this system has broadened our understanding of late regulatory mechanisms .
The fidelity of this assay in recapitulating late events in the EBV infection cycle provides a tractable experimental model to address the regulation of late gene expression in greater detail .
Using this system , we have identified cis-active regulators of late gene expression ( unpublished data ) .
