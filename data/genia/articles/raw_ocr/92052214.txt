10079-10083 , November 1991 Cell Biology Clone pAT 133 identifies a gene that encodes another human member of a class of growth factor-induced genes with almost identical zinc-finger domains ( growth regulation / transcription factors /gene family ) Hans-JoAcHIM MULLER , CHRISTINE SKERKA , ALEXANDRA BiALONSKI , AND PETER F. Ziprer* Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine , Bernhard-Nocht-Strasse 74 , 2000 Hamburg 36 , Federal Republic of Germany Communicated by Hans J. Miiller-Eberhard , August 5 , 1991 ( received for review June 5 , 1991 ) ABSTRACT We report the structure and regulation of a gene represented by clone pAT 133 , which is induced upon transition from a resting state ( G , ) through the early phase of the cell cycle ( G ; ) .
The pAT 133 gene is immediately induced , with FOS-like kinetics , in human T cells and in fibroblasts .
Primary structure analysis showed that the encoded protein contains three tandem zinc-finger sequences of the type Cys ; -Xaa ; , -His , .
This zinc-finger region , which is thought to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner , is similar ( > 80 % on the amino acid level ) to two previously described transcription factors pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 .
Except for the conserved zinc-finger domains , the amino acid sequences of the three proteins are distinct .
This structural similarity suggests that the pAT 133 gene encodes a transcription factor with a specific biological function .
Comparing the regulation of these related zinc-finger-encoding genes showed coordinate induction upon mitogenic stimulation of resting T lymphocytes and of resting fibroblasts .
However , upon transition from a proliferating ( G , ) to a resting state of the cell cycle the three genes were differently regulated .
In human histiocytic U937 cells mRNA of clone pAT 133 was constitutively expressed , whereas mRNA of pAT 225/EGR1 was induced upon induction of terminal differentiation .
In contrast mRNA representing pAT 591/EGR2 was not expressed in these cells .
This difference in gene regulation suggests distinct biological roles in the control of cell proliferation for the respective proteins .
Mitogenic activation of resting peripheral blood T lymphocytes is triggered in vivo by antigenic peptides associated with molecules of the major histocompatibility complex ( 1 ) .
In vitro this activation can be mimicked by agents like phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) .
Upon activation T cells respond by initiating sequential transcriptional reactions , which eventuate in cell proliferation and expression of effector function ( 2 , 3 ) .
The genetic program induced in resting T cells upon mitogenic stimulation is closely related to that induced by growth factors and by other extracellular ligands in a variety of cells , including fibroblasts .
A large number of genes , identical in T cells and in fibroblasts , is immediately acti-vated , and several of these have been cloned from activated T cells and from serum-stimulated fibroblasts , including genes that encode transcription factors ( 4-14 ) .
Some of these transcription factors contain zinc-finger structures that are thought to bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner ( 15 , 16 ) .
Previously , > 60 distinct cDNA clones have been identi-fied , which represent genes that are induced upon mitogenic stimulation of human T lymphocytes ( 6 , 17 , 18 ) .
Two of these clones , pAT 225 and pAT 591 , represent DNA-binding pro The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

10079 teins with almost identical zinc-finger domains ( ref .

and P.F.Z. , unpublished work ) .
Identical cDNA sequences termed EGR1 and EGR2 were isolated from human fibro-biasts ( 9 , 19 ) and also from rat and mouse cells ( termed egr-1 , zif268 , NGFI-A , Krox-24 , egr-2 , and Krox-20 , respectively ) ( 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 20 ) .
The product of the zif268 gene , which is the murine homolog of the pAT 225/EGAR !
gene , has been shown to bind to its own promoter and to that of other growth factor-induced genes ( 21 ) .
The Krox-20 protein-i.e. , the murine pAT 591/EGR2 product-binds to the promoter of the murine homeobox containing gene Hox-/.4 ( 22 ) .
We report the nucleotide sequence and the regulation of a cDNA clone pAT 133 , the product of which represents another DNA-binding protein with zinc-finger structure . ?
The nucleotide sequence of this clone displays three tandem zinc-finger regions .
These regions are almost identical to the zinc-finger regions of the two human transcription factors pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 , suggesting a similar function for the pAT 133 product .
Despite the sequence similarity of the DNA-binding regions , the three proteins display distinct NH ; - and COOH-terminal sequences , suggesting distinct biological roles .
The three genes were coor-dinately induced and regulated upon mitogenic stimulation but were regulated differently during monocytic differentiation of histiocytic U937 cells .
MATERIAL AND METHODS T Cell Isolation .
Human peripheral blood T cells were obtained from buffy coats from healthy donors of the Blood Bank ( University Hospital , Hamburg-Eppendorf ) and were isolated as described ( 6 ) .
Briefly , after Ficoll/Hypaque cen-trifugation , T cells were enriched on nylon/wool columns and were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium/10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FCS ) at a concentration of 2 x 10° cells per ml .
Cell Culture and Stimulation .
Peripheral blood T lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA ( Burroughs Wellcome ) at 1 ug/ml , PMA ( Sigma ) at 25 ng/ml , 200 nM calcium ionophore A23187 ( Sigma ) , or with a combination of these stimuli in the presence or absence of cycloheximide ( Sigma ) at 10 ug/ml .
U937 cells were cultivated in RPMI medium/10 % FCS/ penicillin/streptomycin/gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C .
Differentiation of U937 cells was induced at 2 x 10° cells per ml with PMA at 25 ng/ml with or without cycloheximide at 10 ug/ml .
Human fibroblasts MRC-5 ( pas-sage 18-25 ) were grown in Eagle 's minimal essential medium/10 % FCS/penicillin/streptomycin/gentamicin .

reaching confluence the cells were kept in growth medium/ 0.5 % FCS for 3-4 days .
To stimulate cell growth the medium was replaced by fresh medium/20 % FCS with or without cycloheximide ( 10 ug/ml ) .
RNA Isolation and Blotting .
Total cellular RNA was extracted with guanidinium isothiocyanate and isolated by centrifugation ( 23 ) .
The RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically , and 8 ug of total cellular RNA was separated by electrophoresis in a formaldehyde/agarose gel and subsequently transferred to a nylon membrane ( Pall ) .
Southern Blot Analysis .
Human DNA ( 10 ug ) isolated from U937 cells was digested to completion with EcoRI , Pst I , or BamHI , separated in an agarose gel ( 1.0 % ) , and transferred to a nylon membrane ( Pall ) .
Labeling and Hybridization .
For hybridization the following inserts or fragments were used : ( ? )
a pAT 133 cDNA fragment that covered the 3 ' region of the sequence , ( ii ) a pAT 225/EGR1 cDNA probe representing a 429-base-pair ( bp ) Sph I-Pvu II fragment of the COOH-terminal part ( position 1388-1817 ) , and ( iii ) a pAT 591/EGR2 cDNA probe covering the specific region of the sequence ( position 32-367 ) .
Inserts were excised , labeled with *P by random priming ( Amer-sham ) , and used for hybridization at 42°C [ 5x Denhardt 's solution , 5x standard saline citrate , 0.1 % SDS , denatured salmon sperm DNA at 250 ug/ml , and 50 % ( vol/vol ) form-amide ] .
After hybridization for 14-18 h the filters were washed at a final stringency at 0.1 % standard saline citrate at 55°C or 60°C .
The filters were exposed at -70°C by using intensifying screens ( Quanta III ; DuPont ) .
Isolation of Additional pAT 133 cDNA Clones and Sequence Analysis .
The cDNA clone pAT 133 was originally derived from a subtracted cDNA library ( 6 ) .
This fragment was used to isolate additional clones from a cDNA library prepared from human peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PHA/ PMA for 4.5 h in the presence of cycloheximide .
Two overlapping cDNA clones , pAT 133-15 and pAT 133-17 , were sequenced in double-stranded form by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method with adenosine phosphate and Sequenase II ( United States Biochemical ) ( 24 ) .
Clone pAT 133-17 covered position 1-1699 , and clone pAT 133-15 started at position 361 and included 25 residues of a poly ( A ) tail .
Various oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as primers to sequence the cDNA clones in both orientations .
The inserts were also subcloned into M13 , and single-stranded DNA was isolated and sequenced .
To resolve G+C-rich regions electrophoresis was done in 8 % polyacryl-amide gels with 40 % ( vol/vol ) formamide and 7 M urea .
RESULTS Kinetics of Induction in T Cells .
The gene corresponding to cDNA clone pAT 133 was rapidly induced in human peripheral blood T cells upon mitogenic stimulation ( Fig .
1 ) .
In the presence of the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , pAT 133 mRNA was superinduced .
However , in its absence , pAT 133 induction was relatively weak , and mRNA could be detected only after 45 min of PHA/PMA treatment and upon prolonged exposure ( =~1 week ) .
This kinetic analysis shows that pAT 133 mRNA is induced rapidly in human peripheral blood T cells and that de novo protein biosynthesis is not required for induction .
Nucleotide Sequence of pAT 133 .
The nucleotide sequence of two overlapping cDNA clones was determined , and , based on the estimated size of the mRNA from Northern blot analyses , the cDNA sequence is virtually full length .
The sequence of 2169 nucleotides is rather G+C-rich ( 65 % ) and revealed a single long open reading frame .
The ATTAAA motif , starting at position 2138 , appears to represent a polyadenylylation signal because after 11 nucleotides it is followed by a long stretch of adenine residues .

Predicted Amino Acid Sequence Derived from pAT 133 cDNA .
The predicted product of the pAT 133 gene contains 486 amino acids with a calculated molecular size of 50.6 kDa ( Fig .
2 ) .
The deduced pAT 133 protein is rich in proline ( 14.0 % ) , alanine ( 12.8 % ) , leucine ( 10.3 % ) , serine ( 9.5 % ) , and glycine ( 9.7 % ) residues .
The high content of serine and the nine tyrosine residues suggests that the pAT 133 protein could be phosphorylated .
The protein contains three tandem zinc-finger regions of the type Cys ; -Xaa ; ; , -His > .
The cysteine and histidine residues may bind a Zn** ion , providing a structure that can interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner ; Fig .
3 shows the putative structure of this complex .
One potential site for N-linked glycosylation of the sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser can be found at positions 418-420 .
This site is located within the region of zinc finger II .
Homology Comparison .
A homology search indicated that the zinc-finger region of the pAT 133 sequence showed a rather high degree of similarity to the zinc-finger region of other human genes ( Fig .
4 ) .

This high degree of similarity may indicate a conserved biological function for these proteins .
Southern Analysis .
To determine whether the pAT 133 gene itself is a member of highly related genes , we probed genomic DNA with a fragment specific for the pAT 133 gene .
DNA obtained from human U937 cells was digested with various restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern analysis .
A cDNA probe specific for the 3 ' end of pAT 133 revealed single bands on a Southern blot ( Fig .
5 ) , indicating that pAT 133 represents a single-copy gene .
Regulation of pAT 133 Gene .
To determine the signals necessary for pAT 133 mRNA induction several different stimuli , or a combination thereof , were used to treat human peripheral blood T lymphocytes for 4.5 h. Induction of mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting ( Fig .
6 ) .
In the presence of cycloheximide pAT 133 mRNA was induced by PHA and by calcium ionophore A23187 but not by PMA .
mRNA induction was weak , and in this particular experiment only A23187 could induce pAT 133 message in the absence of cycloheximide .
By comparison , pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 were induced by PHA in the absence of cycloheximide and to an even higher degree by a combination of PHA and PMA .

DNA ( 10 Lg ) isolated from human U937 cells was digested with EcoRI , BamHI , or Sst I , separated on an agarose gel , and blotted onto a nylon membrane .
The filter was probed with a cDNA fragment specific for the 3 ' untranslated region of pAT 133 .
Molecular masses of the markers are shown in kilobases .
in the presence of cycloheximide , induction did not require de novo protein biosynthesis .
PMA alone could not induce these genes in T cells .
However , in combination with PHA or A23187 this agent increased the mRNA levels of both pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 .
For pAT 591/EGR2 induc-tion , mRNA obtained by stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 alone was higher than that obtained by PHA .
This observation suggests that compared with PHA , A23187 can induce additional intracellular signals enhancing transcription of pAT 591/EGR2 .
Expression in Fibroblasts .
Upon serum stimulation of resting human fibroblasts pAT 133 mRNA was induced ( Fig .
7 ) .
The expression was weak as for T cells and could only be detected in the presence of cycloheximide .
Comparing the regulation of the three genes showed that pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 were induced with kinetics similar to pAT 133 , but their mRNAs could be detected in the absence of cycloheximide .
Expression upon Terminal Differentiation of U937 Cells .

It was found that the three genes are differently regulated ( Fig .

In proliferating cells mRNA for pAT 133 could be detected , and steady-state levels were neither changed upon induction of differentiation nor affected by cycloheximide .
In contrast , mRNA for pAT 225/EGR1 was induced upon induction of differentiation , and in an early phase cycloheximide increased mRNA levels .
No mRNA of pAT 591/EGR2 could be detected in U937 cells .

Human cDNA clones with almost identical zinc-finger domains termed pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 have been isolated from T cells and fibroblasts .
Related zinc-finger domains were found in the sequence of the candidate Wilms tumor gene W733 and in that of the eukaryotic transcription factor Spl ( 26 , 27 ) .
Although the amino acid sequences of the zinc-finger regions of pAT 133 , pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2 are almost identical , their flanking regions diverge significantly , indicating related but distinct biological functions .
A schematic representation of the three related zinc-finger-encoding genes pAT 133 , pAT 225/EGR1 , and pAT 591/EGR2 is shown in Fig .
9 .
The functional relatedness is supported by the coordinate regulation of the three genes upon mitogenic stimulation of resting T cells and of serum-starved fibroblasts .
The coordinate induction of the three related human zinc-finger genes upon mitogenic stimulation of resting cells suggests that their products play a role in the transition from Gy-G , phase of the cell cycle .
The mRNA encoding the pAT 133 protein is tightly regulated in T cells and in fibroblasts .

The three proteins have almost identical zinc-finger regions but differ in the amino acid sequences flanking these regions .
All are rich in proline residues , and potential N-linked glycosylation sites are indicated by triangles .
Cell Biology : Miiller et al .
protein sequence shows several potential sites for posttrans-lational modifications , which may be important for the regulation of biological activity .
The protein is rich in amino acid residues that can be phosphorylated .
The high content of serine and threonine residues may serve as sites for O-linked glycosylation , which plays a role in regulation of the transcriptional activity of Sp1 ( 29 ) .
The putative N-linked glycosylation site of pAT 133 is located within the second zinc finger ; this site is conserved in the three closely related genes ( Fig .
9 ) .
Glycosylation of this particular site might alter or disrupt DNA binding , and in this way the regulatory activity of the proteins may be controlled .
Various levels of regulation have been demonstrated for the related candidate Wilms tumor gene W733 .
This gene is subject to alternative splicing , in a region between finger III and IV , resulting in two different mRNA species ( 26 , 30 ) .
In addition , a mutation that results in the deletion of one of the four zinc fingers encoded by the W733 gene abolished its DNA-binding activity ( 34 ) .
As the loss of this DNA-binding seems to contribute to the tumorigenic process , this class of zinc-finger proteins may be important in regulating cell proliferation .
Deregulated expression of the pAT 225/EGR1 mRNA has been demonstrated in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1- or type 2-transformed cell lines ( 14 ) .
Although the pAT 133 was constitutively expressed in U937 cells , its mRNA was not generally expressed in all cell lines tested .
For example , in the human helper T cell line Jurkat , pAT 133 mRNA could neither be detected , nor induced by stimulation with PHA/PMA in the presence of cycloheximide ( P.F.Z. , unpublished work ) .
Although the biological function of pAT 133 is unknown , its expression patterns and its sequence-specific DNA-binding domain suggest a regulatory role of its product in gene expression after mitogenic stimulation .
The pAT 133 gene product constitutes one of a family of three proteins with almost identical DNA-binding domains but with distinct NH - and COOH-terminal sequences .
The Zif268-protein ( i.e. , the murine homolog of pAT 225/EGR1 ) , the Egr-1 protein , the Krox-20 product ( i.e. , the murine homolog of the pAT 591/EGR2 ) , as well as WT33 protein bind to the same consensus sequence GCGG/TGGGCG ( 21 , 22 , 32-34 ) .
However , this binding is specific , as none of the proteins did bind to the related Spl consensus sequence ( GGGCGG ) ( 21 , 34 ) .
The amino acids of the individual zinc fingers that contact the corresponding nucleotides have been determined for the Zif268 product ( 31 ) .
These amino acids are conserved in the zinc fingers of all four related proteins ( Fig .
4 ) .
In the first finger Arg-393 and Arg-399 , in the second finger Arg-421 and His-424 , and in the third finger Arg-449 and Arg-455 ( num-bering refers to the amino acids of the pAT 133 gene product ) make the primary contact to the target nucleotides .
These target sites have been demonstrated in the promoter of the zif268/egr-1 gene and in that of other early induced genes ( 21 , 22 ) .
However , the effect of binding of each protein may be distinct .
One protein may be involved in the down-regulation of the early induced genes , whereas another protein may cause transcriptional activation of genes expressed at a later stage , thereby regulating the cellular response to growth stimulation , which finally leads to DNA synthesis and to cell proliferation .
A definition of these target genes as well as an understanding of their biological function and regulation will help elucidate the cellular program that governs cell proliferation .
Note Added in Proof .
While this paper was under review , the sequence of the putative rat homolog of pAT 133 : NGFI-C has been described ( 35 ) , and an additional member of this gene family termed EGR3 has been isolated ( 36 ) .
