We have recently shown that the expression of Tax protected the mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 against apoptosis induced by interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) deprivation and converted its growth from being IL-2 dependent to being IL-2 independent .
In this study , we demonstrate that constitutive expression of be/-x/ but not bel-2 , bel-xs , bak , bad , or bax was associated with apoptosis resistance after IL-2 deprivation in CTLL-2 cells that expressed Tax .
Transient-transfection assays showed that be/-x promoter was transactivated by wild-type Tax .
Similar effects were observed in mutant Tax retaining transactivating ability through NF-KB .
Deletion or substitution of a putative NF-B binding site identified in the be/-x promoter significantly decreased Tax-induced trans-activation .
This NF-KB-like element was able to form a complex with NF-KB family proteins in vitro .
Furthermore , Tax-induced transactivation of the be/-x promoter was also diminished by the mutant IBa , which specifically inhibits NF-KB activity .
Our findings suggest that constitutive expression of Bel-x ; , induced by Tax through the NF-B pathway contributes to the inhibition of apoptosis in CTLL-2 cells after IL-2 deprivation .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is the etio-logical agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( 22 , 34 ) .
HTLV-1 encodes a 40-kDa regulatory protein , Tax , that accelerates viral gene expression ( 6 , 13 , 15 , 39 , 41 ) .
This protein is thought to be responsible for the transforming features of HTLV-1 .
This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence , such as in vitro transformation of rodent fibroblasts and human T cells ( 1 , 27 , 46 ) and in vivo induction of a variety of mesenchymal tumors and leukemia in transgenic mice carrying the tax gene ( 20 , 29 ) .
Various mechanisms of T-cell leukemogenesis by HTLV-1 Tax have been proposed .
Some of them relate to the transcriptional activator function of this protein .
Tax activates the transcription of not only HTLV-1 itself but also a number of cellular genes in trans .
This transactivation by Tax is mediated through interaction with transcriptional factors CREB , NF-kB , and serum response factor ( 14 , 42-44 , 56 ) .
Thus , the expression of a variety of target genes related to cellular activation and growth is enhanced by Tax .
These include genes for interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-6 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimu-lating factor , the « chain of IL-2 receptor , Fra-1 , c-Myc , c-Fos , and c-Jun ( 36 , 55 ) .
Aberrant expression of these proteins could be involved in the dysregulated proliferation of HTLV-1-in-fected cells .
Recent studies support another hypothesis ; that Tax may induce cell cycle promotion through protein-protein interaction .

Tax may also directly associate with cyclin D , which is important in cell cycle transition from G , to S phase ( 30 ) .
Tax also influences cell apoptosis .
We and others have previously shown that human T-cell lines expressing Tax were resistant to apoptosis signals triggered through Fas receptors ( 2 , 9 ) .
A similar resistance to apoptosis was observed in T cells derived from transgenic mice carrying the tax gene ( 25 ) .
Resistance to cell apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of autoim-munity and is also an important requirement for the immortalization of T cells ( 7 , 33 ) .
Other investigators , however , have reported opposite observations ; Tax induces apoptosis of rat fibroblasts and a human T-cell line under certain conditions ( 7 , 53 ) .
The precise mechanisms of the Tax effect on apoptosis are not well understood .
We have recently shown that the expression of Tax in a mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 converted its growth from being IL-2 dependent to being IL-2 independent .
Not only promotion of cell cycle but also prevention of apoptosis occurred in these cells in the absence of IL-2 ( 23 ) .
In the present study , we investigated the mechanisms by which Tax prevents apoptosis .
We demonstrated ( i ) that constitutive expression of Bel-x , , one of the molecules protecting cells against apoptosis , is associated with resistance of CTLL-2/Tax transfectants to apoptosis induced by IL-2 deprivation and ( ii ) that Tax transactivates bel-xl through the NF-kB pathway .
This is the first report that indicates the involvement of Bel-x , , in HTLV-1 Tax-induced inhibition of apoptosis in T cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
Plasmids containing wild-type tax ( pBMT-2Tax ) , mutant tax genes ( pBTax703 and pBTaxM22 ) driven by a B-actin promoter , and its control plasmid ( pHBAPr-1-neo ) were used ( 21 , 26 ) .
Wild-type Tax encoded in pBMT-2Tax is effective in the activating NF- « B , CArG , and CRE sites .
On the other hand , the 7982 TSUKAHARA ET AL .
Tax mutant encoded by pBTax703 can activate the NF- « B site but not the CArG or the CRE site , while the Tax mutant encoded by pBTaxM22 can activate the CArG and CRE site but hardly the NF-B site ( 40 , 44 ) .
We also used the mouse bel-x promoter-driven luciferase ( Luc ) reporter plasmid pGL2-3.2 , which contained a 3.2-kbp fragment upstream of the bei-x gene ( 19 ) .
pGL2 ( 1160 ) , pGL2 ( 848 ) , pGL2 ( 822 ) , and pGL2 ( 631 ) were newly generated by insertion of DNA fragments of the bel-x promoter at the base positions of -1160 to -75 , -848 to -75 , -822 to -75 , and -631 to -75 from the translation initiation ATG of the bel-x gene , respectively , into the basic pGL2 vector containing a Luc reporter gene ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
These DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with DNA templates extracted from CTLL-2 cells and four sense primers , ( 5'-CCGCTCGAGGAGGTCTCCACTGTGGGAGC-3 ' , 5 '' -CCGCTCGAGGGAA GTCCCTTTAGGGTTTC-3 ' , 5-CTCATCTAGGGCTGGTACIT-3 ' , and 5'-C CGCTCGAGTGGTCGATGGAGGAACCAGG-3 ' ) and one antisense primer ( 5'-GAAGATCTAGCGATTCTCTTCCAGGATC-3 ' ) .
pGL « BM is a mutant of pGL2 ( 848 ) , carrying CC-to-GG mutations at positions of -841 and -840 within the NF- « B binding site , which were generated by PCR by using primers with the mutation .
Plasmid integrity was confirmed by DNA sequencing .
Another Luc reporter plasmid , WT-Luc , containing five tandem repeats of 21-bp Tax-inducible CREs of HTLV-1 LTR originated from 21WT-CAT ( 16 ) , was kindly provided by J. Fujisawa ( Kansai Medical University , Osaka , Japan ) .
peDNA3-IxBaM was constructed by cloning an IxBoM-coding region in pBlue-script SK ( - ) -I « xBa $ 32A/5836A , a kind gift from J. Inoue ( Tokyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) , into pcDNA3 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , Calif. ) with the cytomega-lovirus promoter .
pSV-B-Galactosidase Vector ( Promega ) was also used .
Cell lines and transfections .
The mouse IL-2-dependent T-cell line CTLL-2 ( 18 ) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( RPMI-10 % FCS ) , 50 M 2-mercaptocethanol and 1 nM human recombinant IL-2 ( brIL-2 ; Ajinomoto , Yokohama , Japan ) at 37°C and 5 % CO , CTLL-2 cell clones permanently expressing wild-type and mutant HTLV-I Tax were established by neomycin-selection after gene transfection as described below .
CTLL-2 cells ( 10 '' ) were resuspended in 0.7 ml of FCS-free RPMI containing 10 ug of wild-type or mutant Tax expression plasmids and electroporated by use of a Gene Pulser ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , Calif. ) at 320 V and 950 mF .
Then , the cells were resuspended in 20 ml of RPMI-10 % FCS and 1 nM hrIL-2 .
After 48 h , the cells were selected in 24-well plates in G418-containing medium ( 0.4 mg/m ! )
for 3 weeks .
Wells were screened for Tax expression by Western blot analysis , and cells in the wells positive for Tax were further cloned by the limiting-dilution method .
In this study , we used two or three randomly selected clones for each group of CTLL-2/Tax transfectants .
We also used an IL-2-independent T-cell line , Jurkat , which originated from human acute lymphocytic leukemia ( 38 ) .
Western blot analysis .
Expressions of HTLV-1 Tax , Bcl-x ; , and « -tubulin in CTLL-2 cell clones were analyzed by Western blot assays as described previously ( 23 ) .
Briefly , cell lysates prepared from CTLL-2 ( 5 X 10° cells ) were subjected to electrophoresis under reduced conditions on a discontinuous 12.5 % polyacrylamide gel with sodium dodecyl sulfate , and the proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes .
The blots were first incubated with a human serum containing anti-Tax antibodies , rabbit antiserum specific for Bcel-x ; , ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , Ky. ) , or mouse monoclonal antibody to « -tubulin ( Oncogene , Cambridge , Mass .
) , then rinsed , and finally incubated with second antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase .
Sites of antibody binding were visualized by using ECL Western blotting detection system ( Amersham International Plc , Little Chalfont , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom } .
RPA .
We analyzed the levels of belzl , bel-xs , bak , bax , bel-2 , and bad gene mRNAs in CTLL-2 cells cultured with or without IL-2 for 48 h by RNase protection assay ( RPA ) with the RPA II kit ( Ambion , Austin , Tex . )
as described previously ( 24 ) .
Cells were lysed in Isogen ( Nippon Gene , Toyama , Japan ) solution , and total cellular RNA was extracted by separation over CHCl , and precipitation with isopropanol .
The total RNA ( 20 mg ) was hybridized with a mixture of `` P-labeled antisense RNA probes ( 3 X 10* cpm ) overnight at 42°C in a hybridization buffer containing 80 % formamide and then treated with RNase A/T1 .
The resultant protected RNAs were separated on a 5 % acrylamide gel with 8 M urea and visualized by autoradiography .
As internal controls , the mRNA levels of a ribosomal protein ( L32 ) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were analyzed .
RNA probes used for this assay were synthesized by in vitro transcription with templates included in an mAPO-2 multiprobe template set ( PharMingen , San Diego , Calif. ) .
Transient-transfection assay .
To evaluate the ability of Tax to activate transcription of bel-x , 10° Jurkat cells were cotransfected by the DEAE-dextran method with 4 pg of a reporter plasmid pGL2-3.2 or control WT-Luc , 1 ug of pSV-B-galactosidase containing the bacterial B-galactosidase gene driven by the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) promoter , and an effector plasmid containing wild-type or mutant Tax at a 1:2 molar ratio with the reporter plasmids .
After 48 h of incubation , cells were harvested , and Luc activity in the cellular lysates was measured with a luminometer ( Lumat ; Berthold & Co. ) .
All Luc assays were performed in triplicates .
At the same time , the activity of B-galactosidase in the lysates was measured as described previously ( 37 ) .
Luc activity was normalized with B-galactosidase activity .
EMSA .
Binding activity of NF- « B proteins to NF-kB elements was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) as described previously ( 23 ) .

Constitutive expression of bel-x/ mRNA and Bcl-x , protein in CTLL-2/Tax transfectants in the absence of IL-2 .
( A ) RNase protection assays with specific probes for bel-xl , bel-xs , bak , bax , bel-2 , and bad genes were performed by using 20 pg of total RNA samples extracted from CTLL-2/Vec- # 22 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , CTLL-2/WT- # 34 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , CTLL-2/703- # 23 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , and CTLL-2/M22- # 23 ( lanes 7 and 8 ) after 48 h of culture in the presence ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ) or absence ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) of 1 nM IL-2 .
Similar results were obtained with another set of independent clones .
( B ) Western blot analysis of Bcl-x ; , ( top ) and « -tubulin ( bottom ) expression in CTLL-2/Tax transfectants .
In each lane , we used 50 ug of total cell lysates prepared from a similar set of CTLL-2 clones as described in panel A .
The arrangement of lanes is similar to that of panel A .
Specific protein bands are indicated by arrows .
Similar results were obtained with another set of independent clones .
brief , 10 pg of nuclear extracts prepared from 10 '' of CTLL-2/Tax transfectants cultured with or without IL-2 for 48 h were preincubated with a binding buffer containing 1 g of poly ( dI-dC ) .
They were then incubated with approximately 20,000 cpm of °°P-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing NF-kB like elements for 20 min at room temperature .
The DNA-protein complex was separated on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
To examine the specificity of the NF-B-like element of the probes , unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice prior to incubation with probes .
The probes or competitors utilized were prepared by annealing the sense and antisense synthetic oligonucleotides as follows : NF- « B-like element in the belx promoter , 5'-cgatAAAGGGACTTCCAAGat-3 ' and 3'-taTTTCCCTGAAGGTTCtage-5 ' ; NF- « B-like mutant clement , 5'-cgatAA ACCGACTTCCAAGat-3 ' and 3'-taTTTGGCTGAAGGTTCtage-5 ' ; typical NF- « B element of SV40 early promoter , 5'-cgatAGAGGGGACTTITCCGat-3 ' and 3'-taTCTCCCCTGAAAGGCtage-5 ' ; and typical CRE sequence of T-cell receptor « promoter , 5'-cgatCCATGACGTCATGGat-3 ' and 3'-taGGTACTG CAGTACCtage-5 ' .
( Lowercase letters signify nonsense nucleotides inserted to make cohesive ends , which increases the radiolabeling efficiency . )
To identify NF- « B proteins in the DNA-protein complex by EMSA , antibodies specific for various NF-kB family proteins , including NF- « B p65 , NF- « B p50 , c-Rel , RelB , and NF- « B p52 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) , were used to elicit supershift and/or inhibition of the bands .
These antibodies were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 1 h on ice prior to incubation with radiolabeled probes in EMSA .

Transactivation of belx promoter by Tax .
Jurkat cells ( 10° ) were cotransfected with 2 g of the Luc reporter plasmid pGL2-3.2 driven by the beix promoter , 1 pg of pSV-B-galactosidase , and 2 pg of Tax-expressing plasmids or its control vector pHBAPr-1-neo ( BA ) .
The Tax-expressing plasmids utilized were pBMT-2Tax ( WT ) , pBTax703 ( 703 ) , and pBTaxM22 ( M22 ) .
Luciferase activities were normalized with B-galactosidase activity .

cient in activating the NF- « B site ( M22 ) ( 23 ) .
By using these clones , we demonstrated that CTLL-2 clones transfected with WT Tax ( CTLL-2/WT ) and mutant Tax 703 ( CTLL-2/703 ) but not the parental CTLL-2 or CTLL-2 clones transfected with Tax M22 ( CTLL-2/M22 ) or control vector ( CTLL-2/Vee ) were resistant to apoptosis induced by IL-2 deprivation ( 23 ) .
To dissect the molecular mechanisms of Tax-induced inhibition of apoptosis in CTLL-2 cells , we determined the NF-xB SP-1 -- - { el } : = pGL2-3.2 _F -1160 —D—o— ( D—0—Mﬁé——| : pGL2 ( 1160 ) _F -848 WM pGL2 ( 848 ) _F -822 WEDGLKSZZ ) _F 631 -- é & @ -//4-C -- pGL2 ( 631 ) —F s18 -- - pGL2xBM r INDUCTION OF Bcl-x , BY HTLV-1 Tax THROUGH NF-kB - 7983 mRNA-levels of several apoptosis-related genes , including be/-xl , bel-xs , bak , bax , bel-2 , and bad in CTLL-2/Tax transfectants , by using RNase protection assays .
A representative result is shown in Fig .
1A .
In a clone of CTLL-2/Vee ( CTLL-2/Vec- # 22 ) , the mRNA level of bei-xl , which is known to inhibit apoptosis , was markedly decreased after 48 h of IL-2 deprivation .
Expression of bak slightly decreased by IL-2 deprivation , but none of the other members of the bel family tested was significantly affected by IL-2 deprivation .
Bei-xs mRNA , a spliced variant of be/-xl ( 19 ) , was not detected in any of these CTLL-2 cells regardless of the presence of IL-2 .
In contrast , clones of CTLL-2/WT and CTLL-2/703 ( CTLL-2/WT- # 34 and CTLL-2/703- # 23 , respectively ) showed a constitutive expression of bei-xl even in the absence of IL-2 .
However , the induction of bei-xl mRNA in a CTLL-2/M22 clone ( CTLL-2/M22- # 23 ) was dependent on the presence of IL-2 .
Similar results were obtained by using another set of independent clones of CTLL-2/Tax transfectants .
Constitutive expression of the Bel-x , , protein in stable CTLL-2 transfectants with Tax was also confirmed by Western blot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
1B , CTLL-2/WT- # 34 and CTLL-2/703- # 23 but not CTLL-2/Vee or CTLL-2/M22- # 23 expressed detectable levels of Bel-x , , protein after 48 h of IL-2 deprivation .
The levels of « -tubulin , a cytoskeletal protein as an internal control , was comparable among these clones .
The protein levels of Bak in CTLL-2/WT clones did not differ from those of CTLL-2/Vee clones in the absence of IL-2 ( data not shown ) .
These results suggested that the constitutive expression of Bel-x , , in CTLL-2/WT and CTLL-2/703 clones in the absence of IL-2 may contribute to Tax-induced resistance to apoptosis .
We then explored the mechanisms of Bcl-x , induction by HTLV-1 Tax .

Mapping of HTLV-1 Tax-responsive region in the bex promoter .
A series of Luc reporter plasmids based on pGL2 vectors containing fragments of 5 ' flanking region of the bel-x gene were cotransfected into Jurkat cells with WT Tax plasmid pBMT-2Tax ( solid bars ) or its control plasmid ( open bars ) , together with reference plasmid pSV-B-galactosidase .
Luciferase activities normalized with B-galactosidase activities after 48 h of incubation are indicated .
Constructs of the reporter plasmids utilized are schematically illustrated in the left panel .
Fragments of the 5 ' flanking region of bel-x gene are represented by heavy lines , and the number at the 5 ' end of each construct indicate the 5'-most end base positions from the translation initiation codon of the bel-x gene .
The locations of the binding sites for transcription factors NF-B ( ] ) , SP-1 ( { } ) , Ets-1 ( @ ) and GATA-1 ( ¥ ) , identified by using a transcription factor database ( 1a ) , are also indicated .
pGL2 « BM contained mutations within the NF- « B site ( X ) as described in Materials and Methods .
Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments .
7984 TSUKAHARA ET AL .
negative IL-2-independent human T-cell line Jurkat but not CTLL-2 cells were used since CTLL-2 cells can not survive in the absence of IL-2 after transfection with plasmids .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with Tax effector plasmids and a Luc reporter plasmid ( pGL2-3.2 ) containing a 3.2-kbp segment of 5 ' flanking region of the mouse be/-x gene in the absence of IL-2 ( 19 ) .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the Luc activities of Jurkat cells transfected with WT Tax or Tax 703 were seven to nine times higher than those of cells transfected with the control vector .
However , Luc activity in cells transfected with Tax M22 plasmid was almost equivalent to that in control cells .
These results indicated that both WT Tax and Tax 703 transactivates bex promoter activity , presumably through the NF- « B pathway .
Mapping of HTLV-1 Tax-responsive regions in the bex promoter .
We next mapped Tax-responsive elements in the mouse be/-x promoter .
Several consensus motifs for the binding of transcription factors such as SP-1 , Ets-1 , and GATA-1 have been identified ( 19 ) .
We also identified an NF- « B binding motif ( GGGACTTCC ) similar to the one in the immunoglobulin promoter , which was located at positions -848 to -840 of the bel-x promoter in an inverted direction .
To examine the contributions of these sites for Tax-induced transactivation , a series of Luc reporter constructs with several fragments of different lengths of 5 ' deleted bei-x promoters were prepared and transiently transfected into Jurkat cells along with Tax expression plasmid or control plasmid ( Fig .
3 ) .
The highest level of Tax-induced Luc activity was observed in cells transfected with the longest construct , pGL2-3.2 .
The two deletion constructs , pGL2 ( 1160 ) and pGL2 ( 848 ) , also responded to Tax significantly .
All three constructs contained both SP-1 and NF- « B binding site-like elements .
However , the Tax-induced Luc activity was markedly reduced in cells transfected with pGL2 ( 822 ) , which had the SP-1 but not the NF- « B site .
The shortest construct pGL2 ( 631 ) , which lacked both the NF-kB and the SP-1 sites , elicited minimal responses to Tax .
Furthermore , a mutated NF- « B-Lue plasmid , pGL « BM , which had the same length as pGL2 ( 848 ) but had a CC-to-GG mutation at positions -841 and -840 within the NF- « B motif , exhibited markedly reduced levels of Tax-induced transactivation as observed with pGL2 ( 822 ) .
These results suggest that the NF-kB site located at positions -848 to -840 in the be/-x gene promoter region is one of the major responsive elements of Tax-induced transactivation of be/kx .
Binding of NF-KB family proteins to the NF- element in bel-x promoter .
We further examined whether NF- « B family proteins can actually bind to the putative NF-kB element identified in the be/-x promoter by EMSA .
The synthetic oligonucleotide containing the NF-kB-site at positions of -848 to -840 in the bel-x promoter was used as a probe .
As shown in Fig .
4A , a clear shifted band was observed when the probes were incubated with nuclear extracts of CTLL-2/WT- # 34 cultured in the presence or the absence of IL-2 .
However , the binding activity of nuclear extracts of CTLL-2/Vec- # 22 was dependent on the presence of IL-2 .
Similar results were observed with parental CTLL-2 cells ( data not shown ) .
Complex formation was competed by 100-fold excess cold probe or unlabeled oligonucleotides with a typical NF-kB consensus sequence of SV40 early promoter but not by oligonucleotides with a mutant NF- « B-like sequence of the be/-x promoter or other unrelated competitors such as CRE sequence .
When the mutant NF- « B-like sequence was used as a probe , complex formation was not observed with nuclear extracts from CTLL-2/WT- # 34 cultured in the absence of IL-2 .
When anti-NF-kB p50 antibody was preincubated with nuclear factors of CTLL-2/WT- # 34 , the bands formed with the probes supershifted in the EMSA , whereas anti-NF- « B p65 and anti-ReIB partially J. Virou .

The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
Competitors used included unlabeled probe ( lane 5 ) , mutant NF- « B like element ( lane 6 ) , a typical NF- « B sequence ( lane 7 ) , and a typical CRE sequence ( lane 8 ) .
Lane 1 represents the band of probes alone .
Radiolabeled probes containing a mutant NF- « B-like element were also incubated without ( lane 10 ) or with ( lane 11 ) nuclear extracts from CTLL-2/WT cultured in the absence of IL-2 .
Specific bands are indicated by arrows .
( B ) Nuclear extracts ( 10 g ) from IL-2-untreated CTLL-2/WT were preincubated without ( lane 1 ) or with antibodies specific for NF- « B family proteins , including NF-xB p65 ( lane 2 ) , NF- « B p50 ( lane 3 ) , c-Rel ( lane 4 ) , RelB ( lane 5 ) , NF- « B p52 ( lane 6 ) , and control rabbit antiserum ( lane 7 ) , and then incubated with radiolabeled probe containing the NF- « B-like element in the bex promoter .
The lower arrow indicates NF-xB-DNA complex alone , while the upper arrow indicates a supershifted band with an anti-NF- « B p50 antibody .
Similar results were obtained with at least three independent CTLL-2/WT clones .
inhibited the complex formation ( Fig .
4B ) .
A similar pattern of supershift was also observed when a typical NF-kB consensus sequence was used as a probe ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that p65 and p50 subunits of NF- « B and RelB can bind the NF- « B like element identified in the be/-x promoter .
Suppression of Tax-induced enhancement of be/-x promoter activity by blocking NF-B pathway .
We then examined whether blocking of the NF- « B pathway can affect Tax-induced transactivation of bei-x/ by transient assays by using a super-repressor form of IxBa mutant ( IxBaM ) that specifically suppresses NF-xB activity .
IxBaM contains serine to alanine mutations at residues 32 and 36 , which abolish phosphorylation sites by IxB kinase .
The IxBaM expression vector was cotransfected into Jurkat cells along with the WT Tax plasmid and the pGL2-3.2 .
As shown in Fig .
5A , the elevated Luc activity in response to WT Tax was markedly suppressed by cotransfec-tion with IxBaM but not with the control plasmid .

( A ) Jurkat cells were cotransfected with 4 mg of bel-x/ promoter-Luc reporter plasmid pGL2-3.2 , 1 pg of pSV-B-galactosidase , and various combinations of 2 ug of pBMT-2Tax and 2 pg of pcDNA3-IxBoM as indicated .
The total plasmid amount for transfection was always adjusted up to 9 pg by adding control plasmids pHBAPr-1-neo or pcDNA3 .
The Luc activity of the samples after 48 h of incubation was normalized to the B-galactosidase activity .
Data represent the mean + the SD of three independent experiments .
( B ) Control experiments with reporter plasmids without potential NF-xB binding sites .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 4 pg of HTLV-LTR ( 21 bp ) -Luc reporter plasmid WT-Luc , 2 ug of pBMT-2Tax , 1 ug of pSV-B-galactosidase , and 2 pg of pcDNA3-IxBaM or pecDNA3 .
The luciferase activity was indicated as described in panel A. the Luc activity of another Luc reporter plasmid , WT-Luc , which can be activated by Tax through the CRE pathway but not through the NF- « B pathway ( 16 ) , was not affected by IxBaM ( Fig .
5B ) .
These results confirmed that the NF-kB pathway was involved in Tax-induced transactivation of the bel-x promoter in these cells .
Involvement of NF-B pathway in constitutive bei-xl promoter activity in CTLL-2/Tax transfectants .
Finally , we examined involvement of the NF- « B pathway in Tax-induced constitutive expression of be/-xl in CTLL-2 cells .
CTLL-2/WT- # 34 were transfected with the pGL2-3.2 in the presence or absence of IxBaM in IL-2-free conditions .
As shown in Fig .
6A , the bel-x promoter activity in CTLL-2/WT- # 34 was partially inhibited by transfection with IxBaM but not with control plasmid .
The Luc activity of WT-Luc lacking potential NF- « B sites was not affected by IxBaM in these cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
Similar results were obtained with at least three independent CTLL-2/WT clones .
These results confirmed the involvement of the NF- « B pathway in Tax-induced transactivation of be/-xl in CTLL-2 cells , as well as in Jurkat cells .
DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrated that HTLV-1 Tax transactivates the bel-x promoter through NF-kB .
Tax-mediated constitutive expression of Bel-x , , in CTLL-2 cells expressing Tax is presumed to prevent these cells from apoptosis induced by IL-2 deprivation .
This can be one of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis resistance shown in our previous study , which demonstrated that Tax converted IL-2-dependent growth of CTLL-2 to IL-2-independent growth ( 23 ) .
RNA protection assays showed that be/-x/ , but not other members of be !
family tested , was constitutively expressed in CTLL-2/WT and CTLL-2/703 clones in the absence of IL-2 ( Fig .
3A ) .
Constitutive expression of Bel-x , , protein was also observed in these cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
Bel-x , , has been shown to inhibit apoptosis of several types of cells including T lympho- cytes ( 4 , 32 ) , and overexpression of Bel-x , , protects CTLL-2 cells against apoptosis after IL-2 deprivation ( 3 ) .
Therefore , Tax-induced constitutive expression of Bel-x , , can be the underlying molecular mechanism of resistance of CTLL-2 cells expressing Tax to apoptosis after IL-2 deprivation .
Other investigators , however , reported that the otherwise IL-3-depen-dent B cells could grow independently of IL-3 when they expressed both Tax and c-Myc but not Tax or c-Myc alone ( 28 ) .
bel-xl induction by Tax was not observed in these cells .

Inhibition of constitutive activation of promoter in CTLL-2/Tax transfectants by IxBaM .
( A ) CTLL-2/WT clone cells were transfected with pGL2-3.2 , pSV-B-galactosidase , and either peDNA3-IxBaM ( solid bar ) or peDNA3 ( open bar ) .
Luc activity after 48 h of incubation in the absence of IL-2 was normalized to B-galactosidase activity and indicated as the percentage of activity in the IxBaM ( - ) sample .
Data represent the mean + the SD of three independent experiments .

cell types implies a requirement of cellular mediators in this phenomenon .
Although Bcel-2 is also known to protect cells against apoptosis ( 10 , 11 ) , the expression of be/-2 did not correlate with Tax-induced resistance to apoptosis of CTLL-2 in the present system .
This finding is consistent with that of previous reports demonstrating that Tax did not induce be/-2 expression in human endothelial cells and a pro-B cell line ( 28 , 31 ) .
Expression of bax , an accelerator of apoptosis , was not significantly affected by Tax in the present study .
However , other investigators reported that Tax repressed bex transcription ( 5 ) .
In general , the Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-x , /Bax ratios are thought to be important determinants of apoptosis ( 35 ) .
Our results of Tax-induced activation of be/-xl , together with the finding of Tax-induced repression of bex by others , suggest that Tax inhibits apoptosis by increasing the Bcl-x , /Bax ratio in HTLV-1-in-fected cells .
Tax is known to activate NF- « B by activating IxB kinases and other related molecules ( 8 , 17 , 47 , 54 ) .
Involvement of the NF- « kB pathway in Tax-induced transactivation of be/-xl was strongly suggested by our results that the be/-x promoter was activated by mutant Tax preferentially activating NF-kB ( Fig .
3 ) and that an NF-kB-like element at positions -848 to -840 from the translation initiation codon of bei-x gene was responsive for Tax-induced activation of the be/-x promoter ( Fig .
4 ) .
The binding of NF-kB family proteins , including NF- « B p65 , NF- « kB p50 , and RelB , to the NF- « B-like element that we identified in the mouse be/-x promoter was also confirmed in in vitro ( Fig .
4B ) .
Similar NF-kB binding sequences were also found in the human be/-x promoter ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , the Tax-mediated be ! -x promoter activation was profoundly inhibited by a super-repressor mutant of IxBa ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) or by introduction of mutations in the NF- « B-like element in the mouse bel-x promoter constructs .
These findings suggest that the NF- « B-like element is one of the major responsive regions of Tax-induced be/-x promoter activation .
NF- « B activation is known to inhibit apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha or immunoglobulin G cross-linking in several types of cells unrelated to HTLV-1 ( 48 , 49 , 51 ) .
A few reports suggested the involvement of inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( 50 ) and IEX-1L ( 52 ) , although these could be a part of multiple mechanisms and may also vary among different cell types .
The molecular mechanisms of NF- « B-induced inhibition of apoptosis , apart from the bei-x/ induction demonstrated in the present study , remain to be clarified .
In conclusion , we demonstrated in the present study that Tax enhanced the expression of Bel-x , , at least through the NF-kB pathway , and that this was associated with cellular resistance to apoptosis .
Tax-mediated Bcl-x , induction may be one of the underlying mechanisms of inhibition of apoptosis of HTLV-1 infected cells , which might contribute to the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection .
