To investigate in vivo regulatory mechanisms that control the population of type 2 T cells and disease susceptibility , we have created lines of transgenic mice in which expression of a chimeric cytokine receptor ( the mouse interleukin 2 receptor B chain [ IL-2R BJ ] extracellular domain fused to the cytoplasmic tail of IL-4R a ) is targeted to the T lymphoid lineage using the proximal Ick promoter .
This chimera transduced IL-4-specific signals in response to IL-2 binding and dramatically enhanced type 2 responses ( IL-4 , IL-5 , and immunoglobulin E production ) upon in vitro TCR stimulation or in vivo antigen challenge .
Thus , type 2 effector function was augmented by IL-4 signals transduced through a chimeric receptor expressed in a T cell-specific manner .
This influence was sufficient for establishment of antigen-induced allergic airway hyperresponsiveness on a disease-resistant background ( C57BL/ 6 ) .
Key words : Interleukin ( IL ) -4 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in the growth , differentiation , and survival of lymphocytes ( 1-4 ) , as well as regulating other key hematopoietic cells such as monocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells ( 5 ) .
One of the most important roles of IL-4 in immune regulation is its ability to influence the phenotype of effector T cells as they differentiate from naive precursors ( 1 , 6-8 ) .
For instance , helper and cytolytic T lymphocytes can be divided into distinct subsets of effector cells based on their functional capabilities and the profile of cytokines they produce ( 9 , 10 ) .
The Th1 subset of CD4¢* T cells secretes IFN-y and TNF-B , which activate cell-mediated immune responses optimally suited for immunity to intracellular pathogens ( 11-13 ) ; the Tcl subset of CD8* cells secretes similar cytokines .
In contrast , the Th2 subset produces IL-5 , -6 , -10 , and -13 , in addition to IL-4 , and is associated with immune responses that combat extracellular mi-crobes , in part through help to antibody responses ( 12 , 13 ) .
The mechanisms by which naive T precursor cells differentiate into discrete effector cells remain a subject of intensive investigation .
Factors that control differentiation into Th1 or Th2 cells include strength of signaling through the TCR , antigen presentation ( including antigen dose , route of antigen administration , and type of APCs ) , involvement 1803 interleukin 4 « T cell help « signal transduction * allergic diseases of costimulatory pathways such as those activated by CD28 ligation , and engagement of CD4 coreceptor molecule ( 14-17 , reviewed in 18 ) .
In addition to these regulatory in-fluences , the cytokines to which APCs and T cells are exposed during differentiation of the naive T cell are also a potent influence .
Thus , IL- 12 and IFN-y favor Th1 differentiation and inhibit the emergence of Th2 cells ( 11-13 , 19 , 20 ) .
In contrast , the presence of IL-4 early during priming stimulates Th2 development and represses the production of Th1 cells and their characteristic cytokine products ( 21 , 22 ) .
Data from in vitro systems indicate that there are conditions under which IL-4 can promote the differentiation of purified small , resting T cells into Th2 cells ( 6 ) .
Importantly , however , the ability of these cytokines to influence the development of CD4* T cells in vivo has been studied almost exclusively in systems in which both APCs and naive precursor T cells are affected ( 23 , 24 ) .
Thus , the relative contributions of T cell-autonomous signaling by IL-4 and its effects on APCs during immune responses in vivo remain to be established .
In this regard , previous work has established that , although IFN-y may have some direct effects on T cell development ( 25 ) , inhibition of IFN-y receptor signaling in the T lineage had little effect on Th1 development ( 26 ) .

Absence of interferon regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) ' from APCs led to a similar diminution in Th1 development and a deficit of Thl1 function in vivo ( 27 , 28 ) .
However , it is unclear to what extent IL-4 acts on APCs in promoting Th2 development in vivo .
In light of the potent ability of IL-4 directly to induce the CD28 ligands B7-1 and -2 ( 29 ) and to increase the rate of synthesis of class II MHC proteins ( 30 , 31 ) , a critical role of IL-4 in Th2 development could be mediated through changes in the strength of TCR and CD28 signaling ( 14 , 16 , 18 ) .
Moreover , under some circumstances IL-4-deficient T cells develop cytokine production characteristics consistent with the Th2 phenotype ( 32 , 33 ) .
Taken together , these findings raise the question whether the role of IL-4 in promoting Th2 development under in vivo conditions would be promoted if IL-4 signaling were initially restricted to activated naive T cells and did not affect APCs .
In addition , an apparent gain-of-function mutation in the human IL-4R « chain is associated with atopic diseases ( 34 ) , thus raising the question whether altered patterns of IL-4R signaling in T cells could potentiate allergic disease on an otherwise resistant genetic background .
To investigate such questions concerning in vivo regulation of the balance of types 1 and 2 T cells , we have created lines of mice in which the T lineage expresses a chimeric cytokine receptor .
Specific portions of the human IL-4R « cytoplasmic tail are competent to transduce signals characteristic of IL-4 when fused to human IL-2R B and a portion of its intracellular domain ( 35 ) .
To permit binding of mouse IL-2 and avoid potential confounding influences from cytoplasmic portions of IL-2R B , we have generated a translational fusion between the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the mouse IL-2R B chain and the complete intracellular domain of mouse IL-4R « .
This chimeric receptor transduced signals characteristic of IL-4 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription [ Stat ] 6 activation ) in response to IL-2 binding .
Such signaling was enhanced by activation of thymocytes or T cells , presumably due to the known role of IL-2R « / CD25 in mouse IL-2 binding and function ( 36-38 ) .
Cells from these transgenic ( Tg ) mice exhibited enhanced Th2 responses ( IL-4 and IL-5 production as well as help for IgE production ) .
This influence on the development of effector T cells was sufficient to overcome the resistance of C57BL/ 6 mice to O VA-induced allergic airway disease .
Thus , it is likely that in mice expressing the chimeric receptor transgene , the presence of IL-2 upon antigen challenge favors differentiation of naive T cells into Th2 effector cells by activation , and that this initially cell-autonomous pathway can augment Th2 effector function mediated by IL-4 signals in T cells .

In brief , sequences encoding the extracellular and transmembrane regions of murine IL-2R cDNA were amplified using PFU poly-merase .
The sense oligonucleotide primer corresponded to the -flanking sequence and signal peptide ( 86-113 bp based on reference 40 : 5-CCTGAATTCCTCTCAGCTGTGATGGCTA-3 ' ) with additional nucleotides encoding an EcoRI site .
The antisense oligonucleotide primer corresponded to 908-927 bp , including a naturally occurring KpnI site at the downstream end ( 5-CCAAGGTACCGGCACTTGAC-3 ' ) .

Cytokine ( IL-4 , IL-5 , and IFN-y ) levels from culture supernatants were determined by standard sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( PharMingen ) and standardized to purified recombinant cytokines ( Phar-Mingen for IL-4 and IFN-y ; purified recombinant mouse IL-5 was a gift from DNAX , Palo Alto , CA ) .
Immunization of Mic with OVA and Antibody Measurement .
After obtaining preimmune sera , mice were injected intraperito-neally with OVA ( 10 jg adsorbed on 20 mg aluminum hydrox-ide ; Sigma Chemical Co. ) .
After 7 d , sera were collected from immunized mice , and then analyzed by isotype-specific ELISA to determine levels of OVA-specific and total antibodies .
In brief , ELISA plates ( Corning Glass Works , Corning , NY ) were incubated overnight at 4°C with 50 pl of capture antigen solution ( 20 g/ml OVA for OVA-specific antibody measurements ; sheep anti-mouse IgE [ Serotec Ltd. , Kidlington , Oxford , UK ] or anti-mouse IgG2a [ Southern Biotechnology Associates , Birmingham , AL ] for total isotype determinations ) .

Results Targeted Expression of a Chimenic Cytokine Receptor in T Lineage Cells of Tg Mice .
Earlier in vivo studies have shown that systemic IL-4 has the capacity to inhibit the develop ment of Thl1 cells while promoting the Th2 phenotype ( 23 , 24 ) .
However , it is not clear during such IL-4 exposure in vivo what are the relative contributions of IL-4 signaling within the T cell versus those in APCs .
Moreover , T cells differentiated under strong polarizing conditions in vitro retained their characteristics after transfer in vivo ( 48 ) , but the extent to which different levels of IL-4 signaling within T cells affect Th1 or Th2 development before exogenous antigen challenge is unknown .
To investigate these questions , and to determine if enhanced IL-4 signaling after activation of naive T cells could create susceptibility to allergic diseases in vivo ( 34 ) , we created a chimeric cytokine receptor that could bypass the function of endogenous IL-4 receptors . ''
Because mouse IL-2 binds poorly to human IL-2 receptors , this chimeric receptor was designed as a translational fusion of the ligand-binding and trans membrane domains from the mouse IL-2R B chain and the intracellular domain of the mouse IL-4R « ( Fig .
1 A ) .
The IL-2 and IL-4 receptors share a number of architectural principles .
IL-2R B and IL-4R « are in the same sub-family of hematopoietin receptors , each binds to the Janus kinase Jak1 , and the receptors share a yc chain , leading to Jak3 recruitment ( 49 ) .
Despite these features , they activate different Stat transcription factors and appear to differ in their respective potency for activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate pathways ( 49-51 ) .
Accordingly , transfer of specific domains of human IL-4R « onto a 140-amino acid cytoplasmic signaling domain from human IL-2R B was sufficient for IL-2 induction of CD23 on B cells , a response characteristic of IL-4 but not IL-2 ( 35 ) .
An additional important consideration is that , unlike the human IL-2/IL-2R system , mouse IL-2 is reported to bind mouse IL-2R B and activate resting T cells poorly unless IL-2Ra « is expressed ( 36-38 ) .
Consistent with this possibility , M12 B lymphoma cells stably trans-fected with our chimeric receptor cDNA demonstrated that this receptor transduced IL-4-specific signals ( Stat6 activation , induction of CD23 and the Ig germ line e pro-moter ) , but only when the IL-2R « chain , a protein virtually absent from resting naive T cells and from most thy-mocytes , was also transfected .
This dependency of the mouse IL-2R B chain on IL-2R « expression implied that the chimeric receptor molecule might not bind IL-2 efficiently until a cell was induced to express IL-2R a chain , thus providing a mechanism to protect thymocyte and T cell development from abnormalities induced by IL-4 ( 42 ) .
Since IL-2 is a ligand that will be present at high concentration early after activation of naive T cells , these features suggested that a mIL-2R B/ mIL-4R « chimera might activate IL-4-specific signals in the absence of IL-4 , but would signal inefficiently before T cell activation .
In light of these findings , we created Tg mice in which expression of this chimeric receptor was targeted to the T lymphoid lineage using the T lineage-specific regulatory sequences of the Ick proximal promoter , thus facilitating an Youn , J. , et al. , unpublished observations .

- Targeted expression of the chimeric IL-2R B/IL-4R « transgene to T-lineage cells ( A ) Structure of chimeric cytokine receptor cDNA .
The chimeric IL-2R/4R receptor was composed of extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of mouse IL-2R B , linked to the complete intracellular domain of IL-4R « .
Tyrosine residues and two acidic domains ( ID-1 and I4R ) in the IL-4R « intracytoplasmic tail are indicated .

Splenic T and B cells were separated by nylon wool column , and B cells were further purified by magnetic activated cell sorting ( MACS ) using streptavidin-microbeads after labeling with a biotinylated anti-B220 mAb .
Purity determined by flow cytometry was ~80 % CD3* ( T cells ) or 95 % B220+* ( B cells ) .
RNA was resolved on a formaldehyde-agarose gel , transferred to HyBond filters , and probed with P-labeled DNA comprising the IL-2R B and IL-4R « sequences present in the Tg cDNA .

- Cell surface expression of chimeric receptor molecules on thymocytes and peripheral T cells from Tg mice .
( A ) Representative fluorescence histograms from thymocytes and lymph node cells of NT g or Tg mice were sequentially stained with rat anti-mouse IL-2R $ , biotinylated goat anti-rat Ig , and then streptavidin-PE ( three-layer staining ) .
Lymph node cells were costained with anti-CD4 .
Heterozygous females exhibited the effects of Lyon-ization , with high-level expression of IL-2R f protein on only 50 % of thymocytes .
However , the alterations ( cytokine production ; allergic airway disease ) reported below were observed in both males and females .
The data presented were from second backcross generation mice ; similar results were observed using N1- and N3-generation mice .
( B ) Lymph node cells were costained with anti-mouse IL-2R B-FITC and either anti-CD3-PE or anti-B220-PE as indicated .
The profiles represent the fluorescence intensity of cells from the lymphocyte gate ( FSC and SSC ) and CD4+ , CD3+ , or B220+ gate , as indicated .
( C ) Splenocytes ( @ -f ) , or metrizamide gradient-enriched APCs ( g-7 ) , from wild-type ( NT g ) and chimeric receptor transgene-positive ( Tg ) mice ( N3 generation ) were subjected to three-color indirect immunofluorescent staining as indicated , and then analyzed by flow cytometry .
Uniform compensations and a uniform forward and side-scatter gate were applied to all samples .
CD122 staining in the T cell-enriched gate ( a and b ; I-A and B220 nega-tive ) demonstrated expression of the transgene .
Higher levels of autofluorescence were present in the APC-enriched populations ( e ; ) due to differences between the larger APCs and lymphoid cells , thereby leading to broader CD122 histograms .
In all APC-gated samples , the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFT ) for CD122 in Tg samples was less than the MFI of the wild-type controls .
The same results were obtained using anti-CD122 directly conjugated with fluorescein and appropriate staining combinations for APC markers .
were fractionated into T and B cells and subjected to Northern blot analyses , there was no difference in intensity of a band representing endogenous RNA in Tg and NT g samples and no band at the position of the chimeric transcript could be detected in the B220* cells purified from Tg mice ( Fig .
1 C ; a transgene-specific RNA species migrates at a position [ * ] between two bands containing endogenous RNAs [ o ] ) .
In FACS® analyses , nearly all thymocytes and CD4* cells from male Tg mice expressed the IL-2R B epitope ( CD122 ) at their cell surface , whereas expression of endogenous IL-2R B chains was observed only on a smaller fraction of those cells in NT g littermates ( Fig .
2 A ) .
Of note , the level of CD122 staining on Tg thymocytes and T cells was similar to the staining intensity of positive cells among wild-type samples ; the main difference was in the frequency of positive cells .
Since the staining intensity of CD122 on Tg T cells ( chimeric receptors plus endogenous IL-2R B ) appeared at most fourfold greater than on wild-type cells ( endogenous IL-2R B alone ) , these findings suggest that the number of chimeric receptors is only a few times higher than a cytokine receptor such as endogenous IL- 2R B ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Consistent with the Northern blot data , direct immunofluorescent antibody staining indicated that among cells competent to express the IL-2R « chain , CD3* cells expressed the IL-2R B epitope at levels higher in Tg mice than in their NT g littermates , whereas Tg B220¢* cells did not ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Moreover , the level of 1807 Youn et al .
CD122 on I-A*B220~ cells and populations labeled with cell-surface epitopes that mark macrophages ( CD11bt CD11c* ) and dendritic cells ( CD11b~-CD11c* ) was no different in Tg animals and wild-type controls , whereas increased CD122 expression was readily detected in the T cell-enriched ( I-A~B2207- ) gate of Tg samples ( Fig .
2 C ) .
We conclude that expression of the chimeric cytokine receptor transgene in lymphoid cells is restricted to the T lineage .
Intact Development and Deployment of the T Lineage .
O verexpression of IL-4 in thymocytes using the Ick proximal promoter caused a dramatic decrease in thymic cellu-larity and led to a failure of export of CD8 single positive cells to populate peripheral sites ( 42 ) .
Accordingly , it was possible that the chimeric cytokine receptor transgene would lead to similar derangements .
Alternatively , if it were functionally inert in resting T cells and most thymocytes ( which do not express IL-2R « protein/ CD25 ) , T lineage development and deployment should be normal .
This latter possibility would be consistent with reports that , unlike human IL-2R B , mouse IL-2R B can not signal proliferation of resting thymocytes or CD4* T cells ( 36-38 ) .
Indeed , the size and balance of thymic populations in Tg mice were no different from thymic profiles of their NT g littermates .
Moreover , although there was a subtle variation in the CD4/CDS8 ratio ( Tg , 2.5 + 0.4 vs. NTg , 1.7 + # 0.1 ) , CD4* and CD8* T cells populated the spleen and lymph eal x2 Thymus ho.3 % ] Spleen -/+ Q 0/+ of CD8 Figure 3 .

The absolute numbers of thymocytes ( NT g , 176 X 10° ; Tg , 180 X 10° ) , splenocytes ( NTg , 74 X 10° ; Tg , 83 X 10° ) , T cells , and their subsets were not significantly different in Tg and NT g animals .

3 ) .
Although Ick may be expressed in the natural T cell compartment of NKI1.1-positive TCR - « /B-bearing T cells ( 52 ) , there was no difference between Tg mice and wild-type ( NT g ) littermates in the number of these cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , T cell development appears normal despite the potential for the chimeric cytokine receptor to deliver IL-4-like signals .
IL-4-independent Induction of Statb DNA Binding Adivity in Tg T Cells The finding that T cell development was normal provided evidence , albeit indirect , that signaling by the chimeric receptor may be IL-2R « dependent .
To determine directly if the transgene mediates Stat6 activation under conditions that bypass potential influences from endogenous IL-4 receptors , we performed mobility shift assays using thymocytes and spleen cells that were freshly isolated or first exposed to activating stimuli ( Fig .
4 and data not shown ) .
U sing an oligonucleotide probe whose spacing of the consensus repeat TTC/GAA permits stable binding by Stat6 but not Statl-Stat5 , binding activity was induced in resting spleen cells with addition of exogenous IL-4 ( Fig .
4 A , lanes 5 and 10 ) , whereas mouse IL-2 at 10 ng/ml ( ~0.67 nM , near the K , of an IL-2R By dimer , 1 nM ) did not activate Stato in resting thymocytes or splenocytes ( lanes 2 and 7 ) from Tg mice or controls .
Higher concentrations of mouse IL-2 ( 100 ng/m ! )
or human IL-2 ( 10° Cetus U/ ml ; ~300 ng/ml ) were sufficient to generate nuclear Stat6 binding activity ( lanes 3 , 4 , 8 , and 9 ) , whose relatively low level may reflect inefficient activation through By dimers at concentrations well above their K , , as well as the presence of B cells , which lack chimeric receptor expression ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast to resting cells ( Fig .
4 B , lanes 1-6 ) , activation ( `` priming '' ) and production of IL-2 in the 1808 cultures triggered efficient Stat6 induction in Tg ( lanes 10-12 ) but not NT g cells ( lanes 7-9 ) .
Similar results were obtained when neutralizing antibodies against IL-4 were included during the activation phase of the culture ( Fig .
4 B , lanes 13-18 ) .
The presence of Stat6 in the mobility shift complex was confirmed by supershifting with antiserum specific for Stat6 , whereas anti-Stat5 failed to create a slower mobility complex when using this Stat6- specific oligonucleotide probe ( Fig .
4 C ) .
IL-2-dependent Stat6 induction in Tg cells was also observed for activated thy-mocytes , confirming its association with the T lineage of chimeric receptor Tg mice ( Fig .
4 D ) .
To determine the effect of the transgene on induction of an IL-4 target gene in T cells , we performed Northern blot analyses of the levels of GAT A-3 mRNA , a transcription factor whose levels increase in IL-4-treated T cells and during Th2 differentiation ( 53 ) .
In contrast to the results with wild-type mice , activation of lymphoid cells from chimeric receptor Tg mice led to substantial induction of GAT A-3 without the addition of exogenous IL-4 ( Fig .
4 E ) .
These data do not provide quantitation of the biochemical efficiency of the IL-2R B/ IL-4R « chimera .
Since the flow cytometric data suggest that there is a modest ( less than fourfold ) excess of chimeric receptors relative to wild-type CD122 , our chimeric receptor may induce Stat6 less efficiently than endogenous IL-4R « chains .
Notwithstanding this possibility , we can conclude that upon activation in the absence of exogenous IL-4 , T cells from Tg mice exhibit increased signaling characteristic of IL-4 compared with their NT g counterparts .
Development of Type 2 T Effector Cells from Precursors .
_ In light of this evidence that the chimeric receptor is functional in T cells , we tested whether the transgene could influence the development of Thl or Th2 cells during in vitro stimulation ( Fig .
5 ) .
Cells fom Tg mice produced over 10-fold more IL-4 than those from their NT g littermates when lymph node cells were stimulated through the TCR and costimulatory CD28 molecule for 6 d , washed , and restimulated .
When effector cells developed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-4 during the primary culture , this difference between Tg and NT g mice was more dramatic fold ) , reflecting a greater inhibitory effect of anti-IL-4 on the NTg samples .
Consistent with reports that IL-4-deficient mice can generate Th2-like cells ( 32 , 33 ) , some IL-4 production was still observed under these conditions , perhaps reflecting the important role of costimulation through CD28 .
Indeed , although the output of IL-4 was diminished if anti-CD28 was omitted from the differentiation phase of these cultures , lymph node cells from chimeric receptor Tg mice exhibited a far greater competence to generate IL-4-producing effector cells when compared with their wild-type littermates .
Similar , albeit less dramatic , results were obtained when IL-5 production by these cultures was used as an indicator of effector T cell development .
Despite the potentiation of IL-4 production conferred by this diversion of IL-2 binding into signaling pathways characteristic of IL-4 , IFN-y production was not suppressed .
However , addition of exogenous IL-4 to similar cultures has led to variable inhibition of IFN-y produc- In Vivo Function of an IL-2R/IL-4R Chimera A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 < # 4- Stat6 { 3 £ BEEZ £ i - ® - - a -J IL-2 IL-2 wild-type transgenic B 4 s se s 42 13 18 aw -- -- -¢ -- ﬂg « ~ on fi & oo # ( E “ a “ a- U=WB | -a- stats 19 0000 00 as bulls shea || Re ] =- += - # 4 ao pom m pom s op s =o 4 =- 4 - , resting primed primed ( conA + IL-2 ) ( conA + IL-2+anti-IL-4 ) C 123456789 D 1 2 3 4 5 6 ﬂ-P ” . ” “ ﬂ « a- UUMU UU ... u IL-2 ] ( t2 ] < # 4- Stato -- + -- + -- + _+._+ .

The chimeric receptor induces Stat6 in activated lymphoid cells .
( A ) Induction of Stat6 by IL-2 .
Single cell suspensions of resting splenocytes from wild-type ( NT g ) or chimeric receptor transgene-positive mice ( N3 generation ) were cultured in complete media supplemented ( 30 min at 37°C ) with the indicated concentration of purified recombinant IL-2 ( lanes 2-4 and 7-9 ) , purified recombinant mouse IL-4 ( lanes 5 and 10 ) , or without added lymphokine ( lanes / and 6 ) .
Extracts from these cells were then subjected to mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide from the mouse Ig germ line e promoter ( 44 ) , which exhibits specificity for Stat6 due to an N4 spacing between the TTC and GAA .
( B ) Activation-dependent enhancement of IL-4-independent induction of Stat6 binding activity .
Resting or activated R BC-depleted splenocytes ( N3 generation ) were stimulated ( 30 min at 37°C ) with either IL-2 or IL-4 as indicated .
Where indicated , cells were activated during a 15-h culture in the presence of Con A ( 2.5 g/ml ! )
and IL-2 ( 10 ng/ ml ) , in the pres ence or absence of neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibodies , and then washed before stimulation with IL-2 or -4 .

tion ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that development of the Th2 phenotype in T cells from chimeric receptor Tg mice is potentiated , and indeed can be largely independent of endogenous IL-4 .
Of note , under these conditions the original difference between Tg and NT g cells in levels of IL-4 signaling is confined to the T cells .
Increased Type 2 Cytokine Response and Help to Antibody Production .
- The above data demonstrate that expression of the transgene is able to influence effector T cell development in vitro .
Given that the transgene amplified IL-4-specific outcomes during in vitro differentiation of T cells , we tested its effects on in vivo processes .
First , we investigated this issue by measuring IL-4 and IFN-y production after short-term polyclonal stimulation of lymph node cells in vitro , since the cytokines produced under these conditions are derived predominantly from CD4* T cells expressing an antigen-experienced/memory phenotype ( 13 , 54-56 ) .
Lymph node cells were stimulated 40 h with anti-CD3 and either anti-CD28 or exogenous IL-2 , or both .
Culture supernatants were then subjected to cytokine ELISA ( Fig .
6 A ) , and cells were stained with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies to determine the frequency of IL-4- or IFN- y-pro-ducing cells ( Fig .
6 B ) .
A fourfold increase in IL-4 produced by Tg cells was observed compared with those from NT g littermates .
Consistent with the in vitro differentiation assays ( Fig .
5 ) , Tg cells produced similar or at most slightly reduced amounts of IFN-y compared with NT g controls ( Fig .
6 A ) .
In concert with these data , lymph node cells from chimeric receptor Tg mice included 3 % IL-4-producing CD4* T cells , whereas at most 0.3 % of CD4¢* NTg cells exhibited detectable IL-4 ( Fig .
6 B ; the background of nonspecific staining in these assays was ~0.3 % in the CD4+* gate ) .
Display of IFN-y-producing cells revealed only a modest difference between NT g and Tg mice and demonstrated that the increase in IL-4 production reflected an increase in the frequency of cells that produce IL-4 but not IFN-y , and thus correspond to a Th2 rather IL-4 ( lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) as indicated , were incubated with antiserum against Stat5 ( lanes 4-6 ) or Stat6 ( lanes 7-9 ) as indicated .
DNA-protein complexes were then resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis .
( D ) Induction of Stat6 in activated thymocytes .
Thymocyte suspensions from Tg mice and wild-type littermates were cultured 15 h in PMA ( 50 ng/ ml ) and ionomycin ( 1 g/ ml ) in the presence of mouse IL-2 ( 10 ng/ m1 ) and neutralizing antibodies against mouse IL-4 ( 10 pg/ml ) .
These activated cells were then washed and placed in culture with no added cytokine ( lanes I and 4 ) , mouse IL-2 ( 10 ng/ ml ; lanes 2 and 5 ) , or mouse IL-4 ( 10 ng/ ml ; lanes 3 and 6 ) .
( £ ) Induction of GATA-3 mRNA in Tg lympho-cytes .
Portions of lymphoid cell suspensions ( pooled spleen and lymph node ) from Tg ( N2 generation in this experiment ) and NT g mice were placed in culture ( lanes 3-6 ) or used to prepare RNA without culture ( lanes / and 2 ) .
RN As were prepared after culturing cells 48 h in the presence of immobilized antibodies against CD3 ( 10 ug/ml ) , soluble anti-CD28 ( 5 ug/ml ) , and either mouse IL-4 ( 10 ng/ ml ; lanes 5 and 6 ) or the combination of human IL-2 ( 10 ng/m ! )
and neutralizing antibodies against mouse IL-4 ( 10 pg/ml ! )
( lanes 3 and 4 ) , as indicated .
Northern blot analyses of equally loaded lanes of RNA ( as assessed by hybridization with an rR NA oligonucleotide ; data not shown ) were probed for GAT A-3 as described in Materials and Methods .

Enhanced IL-4-independent Th2 development during in vitro T helper cell differentiation .
Lymph node cells from a pool of three NT g or Tg littermates ( N3 generation ) were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 ( 10 g/m ! )
and either anti-CD28 ( 2 pg/ml ) or recombinant mouse IL-2 ( 20 ng/ m ! )
in the presence or absence of polyclonal antibody to mouse IL-4 ( 10 pg/ml ) , as indicated .
After 6 d of culture , cells were washed and restimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 24 h. Supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods .
These figures are representative of more than three ( for IL-4 and IFN-y ) or two ( for IL-5 ) independent experiments .
Additional experiments using lymph node cells from individual mice of each subline showed no differences in the penetrance of the observed effects on cytokine ( IL-4 , IFN-y ) production .
than a ThO ( 56 ) phenotype .
Taken together , these data suggest that the T cell-autonomous signals transduced by the chimeric cytokine receptor may function in vivo selectively to bias effector T cell development in favor of Th2 cells .
To measure directly the effect of the transgene on an indicator of type 2 help in vivo , we immunized mice with OVA in aluminum hydroxide .
Generation of antigen-specific IgE requires T cell help and IL-4 ( 12 , 13 , 57 ) .
It may normally require days to generate antigen-specific effector cells that are efficient producers of IL-4 , and for the IL-4 to lead to antibody class switching to the epsilon heavy chain exons so as to secrete IgE ( 58 , 59 ) .
Therefore , we chose day 7 after immunization as a time point for comparison of total and antigen-specific IgE levels in chimeric receptor Tg mice to those in their wild-type littermates ( Fig .

Cells were stained with anti-CD4-biotin and streptavidin-PerCP , permeabilized , and stained with both anti-IL-4-PE and anti-IFN-y-FITC , followed by FACS® analysis .
These figures are representative of histograms in two independent experiments .
tion were elevated in the Tg mice ( average of 33- and 11-fold , respectively ) .
Moreover , total IgE levels in Tg mice were elevated even before immunization , suggesting that an increase in type 2 help may be engendered by the chimeric receptor transgene during spontaneous evolution of the lymphoid repertoire in vivo .
In contrast , levels of IgG2a , which is dependent on IFN-y and thus favored by type 1 help , were little different in Tg mice from NT g littermates before immunization , and after immunization were indistinguishable from NTg controls ( Fig .
7 C ) .
These results provide in vivo evidence that T cell-specific expression of the transgene confers a selective enhancement of type 2 help , and suggest the possibility that this effect might be uncoupled from inhibition of type 1 help in vivo .
Moreover , our data suggest that T cell activation that occurred spontaneously may have induced a bias toward provision of type 2 help in Tg mice before antigen challenge .
Importantly , when Tg mice were rechallenged with OVA 5 wk after their first immunization , their IgE anti-O VA recall response remained dramatically greater than that of NT g controls ( Fig .
8 ) .
These results indicate that the trans gene-imposed bias in the helper arm of a response to a specific antigen is sustained in a recall response .

OVA -induable Airway Hyperresponsiveness Due to Chimenc Cytokine Receptor Expression .
- In light of the findings that one parameter of type 2 help in response to a specific antigen was increased in chimeric cytokine receptor Tg mice , we tested whether this effect could be sufficient to enhance an allergic response ( Fig .
9 ) .
After intraperitoneal sensitization with OVA , followed by daily OVA inhalations , BALB/c mice acquire airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine ( 46 , 47 , 60 , 61 ) .
This T cell-dependent hyperresponsiveness is accompanied by eosinophilic airway infiltration and evidence of type 2 help ( 60 , 61 ) .
In contrast to the BALB/c background , C57BL/ 6 mice develop an eosinophilic infiltrate , but less IL-4 production and minimal airway hyperresponsiveness , measurable as increased lung resistance ( 61 , 62 ) .
Consistent with previous reports , the lung resistance of O VA-sensitized NT g littermates was no different than that of unsensitized mice ( Fig .
9 A ) .
In contrast , lung resistance after bronchoconstrictor challenge ( Fig .
9 A ) and airway eosinophilia ( B ) were increased in chimeric receptor Tg mice relative to littermate controls that had been OVA sensitized at the same time .
We conclude that the chimeric cytokine receptor served as a dominant monogenic trait capable of intensifying an allergic disease pro 1811 Youn et al .

cess , presumably through enhancement of the development of type 2 T cells .
Discussion In vitro findings have identified conditions under which IL-4 can induce Th2 differentiation among highly purified T cells .
In vivo experiments investigating the contributions of cytokines to regulating the populations of type 1 ( IFN-y-producing ) and type 2 ( IL-4-producing ) effector T cells have involved perturbations that affect APCs as well as activated T cells .
In light of the influences exerted by antigen dose , APC type , and costimulation intensity ( 13-18 ) , it is not clear what conditions precisely mimic T cell-APC interactions in vivo .
Thus , the ability of IL-4 to promote Th2 development when the initial perturbation is confined to the T lineage , and whether this would be sufficient to enhance allergic disease susceptibility , have not been established .
We have employed an in vivo strategy that used a chimeric cytokine receptor to bypass endogenous IL-4 receptors by broadening the signaling specificity of IL-2 .
This approach was combined with the use of a T lineage-specific promoter to target expression of this receptor as a T cell-specific transgene , so that the initial in vivo perturbations of signaling are segregated from APC populations ( 26 , 42 , and Fig .
2 ) .
This diversion of IL-2 binding into IL-4 signaling pathways enhanced type 2 responses .
Although a precise quantitation of the magnitude of activation of IL-4 signaling by the chimeric receptor in comparison to endogenous IL-4 receptors can not be performed , our findings indicate that T cell-autonomous IL-4 signaling in vivo is sufficient to potentiate Th2 development on a C57BL/6 A 10 p=0.01 _ p=0.015 8 O A % wo » NO OVA I g « -e- NTg/OVA RI a -o- Tg / OVA ut 6C 2 0 5 15 46 137 411 1233 3700 Methacholine ( ug/gm ) B g ... “ CI NO OVA 2 M _ NTg/OVA if & - chimRTg/OVA % 0 TOTAL CELLS MACROPHAGES EOSINOPHILS LYMPHOCYTES Figure 9. .
The chimeric cytokine receptor transgene is sufficient to create sensitivity to allergic airway disease on a disease-resistant background .
( A ) Antigen sensitization of Tg , but not wild-type , mice leads to an increased bronchoconstrictor response .
Mice backcrossed to C57BL/ 6 ( N3 ) were sensitized to OVA by a single intraperitoneal injection ( 10 pg in aluminum hydroxide ) , followed by a series of antigen inhalations as described in Materials and Methods .
Control mice were sham sensitized using PBS .
These mice then underwent measurements of lung resistance to airflow after each of a series of methacholine injections at standard doses ( 47 ) .
The data represent the mean ( + SEM ) values derived from eight sensitized chimeric receptor Tg mice and an equal number of littermates in independent experiments .
Significance values ( comparison of sensitized Tg and NTg animals ) are indicated above the graph at those methacholine doses for which differences were observed .

( Th1-oriented ) background .
Moreover , in vitro evidence suggests that Stat6 induction by IL-2 treatment of activated , Tg T cells is no greater than the response of wild-type cells to IL-4 ( Fig .
4 ) .
As such , these findings complement and extend in vitro evidence suggesting that the genetic background of a T cell is a more important factor in the polarization of effector function than is the source of the APCs ( 63 ) .
One current model for the regulated choice of polarized effector cytokine production divides the process into two phases .
In the first phase , the naive uncommitted precursor is induced to secrete IL-2 and to activate at least low-level transcription of IL-4 and IFN-y ( 64 ) .
The magnitude of 1812 IL-4 gene activation in this phase would depend primarily on the strength of TCR signaling , costimulation , and CD4 engagement ( 14-18 , 56 , 65 ) .
The initial release of IL-4 , or IFN-y and resultant IL- 12 , would then result in an amplification phase during which Stat6 , or Statl and Stat4 , would potentiate the differentiation process .
In contrast to their wild-type counterparts , T cells bearing the chimeric receptor transgene could transduce IL-4-specific signals in the earlier phase due to the presence of IL-2 , leading to enhanced Th2 development .
The observed increase in IgE levels of chimeric receptor mice before immunization with an antigen suggests that these early-phase IL-4 signals may be sufficient to increase the development of effector Th2 cells as the antigen-experienced T cell effector and memory repertoires evolve in vivo .
Since GAT A-3 expression in Tg T cells has been reported to be sufficient to enhance Th2 development ( 53 ) , the finding that GAT A-3 expression is potentiated after activation of chimeric cytokine receptor-bearing T cells may provide the mechanistic basis for the T cell-autonomous increase in Th2 cells However , other transcription factors may also be involved in this effect .
In contrast to the increase in IgE , the finding that IgG2a levels in our Tg mice are essentially normal suggests that the alteration in signaling caused by chimeric receptor expression in T cells may not be sufficient to suppress type 1 help in vivo .
Moreover , no significant decrease in IFN-y production by chimeric receptor transgene-positive cells was observed , even under conditions where Th2 development was > 30-fold more potent than that of NT g counterparts .
Although these data were less conclusive because of the variable ability of exogenous IL-4 to suppress in vitro IFN-y production in our samples , they suggest that when IL-4 signaling during the early activation phase of effector T cell development is confined to the T cells , enhancement of type 2 help may be uncoupled from inhibition of type 1 help .
Consistent with this possibility , transfer experiments suggest that exposure of APCs to IL-4 in vivo creates an APC population that does not support Th1 development ( 15 ) .
Thus , it is possible that IL-4 action on APCs may play a role in the inhibition of Th1 development , a mechanism analogous to the role of APCs in IFN-y-induced Th1 development but in contrast to the T cell-autonomous promotion of Th2 development by IL-4 .
Gene knockout experiments have shown that the IL-4-induced transcription factor Stat6 is involved in inhibition of the emergence of Th1 cells as well as in Th2 development ( 66 , 67 ) .
A potential explanation of the normal IFN-y production and IgG2a is that this inhibitory function of Stat6 is mediated by its activity in APCs .
Since IFN-y acts on APCs to enhance IL- 12 release and promote Th1 development ( 11 , 68 ) , one possibility for target gene regulation in the APCs is that activated Stat6 inhibits induction of inter-feron-responsive factors such as the transcription factor IRF-1 .
In this regard , an intact IRF-1 gene in the APC population is required for normal Thl development ( 27 , 28 ) .
Moreover , IL-4 can inhibit IRF-1 promoter induction ( 69 ) by a Stat6-dependent mechanism ( Goenka , S. , J. Youn , L.-y .
Yu-Lee , U. Schindler , and M. Boothby , manuscript In Vivo Function of an IL-2R/IL-4R Chimera submitted for publication ) .
Thus , one mechanism that could mediate a role for APCs in IL-4-induced repression of Th1 development is inhibition of IRF-1 .
A mechanism that may be T cell-autonomous has been reported to reinforce inhibition of Th1 development by IL-4 in an in vitro system .
In this model , IL-4 inhibits expression on T cells of an IL-12 receptor chain ( IL-12R B2 ) needed for normal signaling ( 70 ) .
These results were obtained using cells from BALB/c-background mice , and the extinction of IL-12R B2 mRNA required ~5 d , a time point at which many cells may already have become committed to IFN-y production ( 64 , 70 ) .
However , our data reflect a C57BL/ 6 background .
Thus , one possible explanation is that Th1 regulation used different mechanisms in cells derived from a BALB/c ( Th2-oriented ) background as compared with C57BL/6-derived cells .
Also , IL-4 signaling by the chimeric receptor may primarily occur early during effector cell differentiation , when IL-2 levels are maximal , so that the mechanism inhibiting Th1 development upon initial T cell activation may differ from the process in which cells committed to a Th2 phenotype are rendered unresponsive to IL- 12 .
An important question underlying these studies is the degree to which genetic influences that bias the effector T cell repertoire account for differences in susceptibility to allergic diseases ( 34 , 71 ) .
Although it is clear that the efficiency of generating type 2 help can be correlated with susceptibility of C57BL ( B6 or B10.D2 ) and BALB/c mice to immunologic diseases ( 61 , 72 , 73 ) , it also is clear that susceptibility arises from complex , polygenic characteristics and not only from Thl/Th2 regulation ( 32 , 33 , 74-76 ) .
For instance , in certain instances BALB/c mice are unable to heal Leishmania major infection despite inactivation of the IL-4 gene ( 32 ) .
A reciprocal question relates to the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic airway disease ( 61 ) .
In particular , it is not clear if the T cell contribution to allergic disease is exclusively a re flection of Th2 development , or if other T cells may be important ( for a review , see reference 77 ) .
While previous studies have shown that transfer of 5 X 10° activated , antigen-specific Th2 cells is sufficient to create susceptibility in BALB/c mice ( 78 ) , other data indicate that far fewer antigen-specific T cells normally arise after immune challenge ( 79 ) .
Moreover , data from other disease models show that normal resistance is overcome when such large numbers of cells are used in transfers ( 80 ) .
The present data indicate that the introduction of a bias toward Th2 development on a C57BL/ 6 background is sufficient to potentiate a bronchoconstrictor response when normal numbers of T cells are present , the response evolves exclusively from antigen challenge , and effector cytokines are produced only by their natural promoters in physiologically appropriate cell types .
Moreover , our findings are consistent with the possibility that a sufficient enhancement of IL-4R « signaling in T cells could promote allergic disease susceptibility in humans ( 34 ) .
These data suggest that one useful application of the chimeric cytokine receptor transgene will be in simplifying the analysis of disease susceptibility traits .
It can be predicted that of the many loci that contribute to differences between C57BL ( B6 or B10.D2 ) and BALB/c mice in disease susceptibility , only some will be involved in regulation of the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells Use of this dominant monogenic trait ( the transgene ) could facilitate identification of those loci that regulate functions other than effector T cell phenotype .
However , it should be noted that the magnitude of such airway hyperresponsiveness was still considerably less than that typically obtained in BALB/c mice ( Aronica , M.A. , and J.R .
Sheller , unpublished observations ) .
Thus , the susceptibility of the BALB/c strain to allergic airway disease probably reflects genetic contributions in addition to its tendency to develop robust Th2 responses .
