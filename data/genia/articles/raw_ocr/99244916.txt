Anwar , Andrea L. True , and Asrar B. Malik We investigated the mechanisms by which proinflammatory mediator , thrombin , released during intravascular coagulation and tissue injury , induces ICAM-1 ( CD54 ) expression in endothelial cells .
Stimulation of HUVEC with thrombin resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in ICAM-1 mRNA and cell surface expression and in ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity toward polymorphonuclear leukocytes .
Transient transfection of endothelial cells with ICAM-1 promoter luciferase reporter gene ( ICAM-1LUC ) constructs indicated that deletion of upstream site ( -533 bases from translation start site ) had no effect on thrombin responsiveness , whereas mutation/deletion of downstream NF-KB site ( -223 bases from the translation start site ) prevented the activation of ICAM-1 promoter , indicating that the downstream NF-KB site is critical for thrombin inducibility .
luciferase activity increased ~3-fold when cells transfected with the plasmid pNF- « BLUC containing five copies of consensus NF-KB site linked to a minimal adenovirus E1B promoter-luciferase gene were exposed to thrombin , indicating that activation of NF-xB was essential for thrombin response .
Gel supershift assays demonstrated that thrombin induced binding of NF-Bp65 ( Rel A ) to downstream site of the ICAM-1 promoter .
Thrombin receptor activation peptide , a 14-amino-acid peptide representing the new NH , terminus of proteolytically activated receptor-1 , mimicked thrombin 's action in inducing ICAM-1 expression .
These data indicate that thrombin activates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion by NF-binding to the downstream NF-KB site of ICAM-1 promoter after proteolytically activated receptor-1 activation .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 : 5466-5476. hrombin , a serine protease derived from the zymogen pro thrombin , plays a critical role in hemostasis ( 1 ) , and func- tions as an agonist for responses in a variety of cell types ( 2-4 ) .
In endothelial cells , the responses of thrombin can be classified into two general categories , type I and type II activation .
Type I activation ( 5 , 6 ) includes the events that occur rapidly and are independent of protein synthesis ( 7-10 ) .
Type II activation ( 6 ) refers to delayed events that are protein synthesis dependent and are transcriptionally regulated ( 11-15 ) .
Thrombin mediates most of its responses through activation of the G protein-coupled receptor PAR-1 '' that belongs to a new family of protease-activated receptors ( 16 , 17 ) .
PAR-1 has a novel mechanism of activation as thrombin binds to the extracellular NH , -terminal , hirudin-like domain ( amino acids 53-64 ) of the receptor and catalyzes receptor proteolysis between arginine-41 and serine-42 ( 16 ) .

Thrombin receptor activation peptide ( TRAP ; SFLLRNPNDKYEPF ) , a 14-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the newly exposed tethered ligand , reproduces many of the cellular responses characteristic of native thrombin ( 16 ) .
Studies have shown that thrombin is an important regulator of polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) adhesion to endothelial cells ( 9 , 10 ) .
The basis of increased endothelial adhesivity may involve type I activation of adhesive proteins such as ICAM-1 ( CD54 ) on the endothelial cell surface .
However , there is no evidence indicating that thrombin mediates type II activation of ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells .
The interaction of ICAM-1 with its counter-receptors on the surface of leukocytes , CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 B ; integrins , is a critical requirement for PMN adhesion and transendothelial PMN migration ( 19 , 20 ) .
ICAM-1 is constitutively present in low levels , but its expression can be transcriptionally up-regulated by cytokines via the activation of NF- « B ( 21-23 ) .
NF- « B/Re !
transcription factors are composed of five distinct DNA-binding subunits , called p50 , p52 , p65 ( RelA ) , c-Rel , and Rel-B ( 24 ) .
The different family members can associate in various homo- or heterodimers through a highly conserved NH-terminal sequence , NRD ( NF- « B/rel/Dorsal ) ( 25 ) or Rel ho-mology domain .
Inactive NF-KB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein I- « B ( IB ) and released after phosphorylation of IB either on serine residues 32 and 36 of IxBa and serines 19 and 23 of IxBB by IB kinases a and B , respectively ( 26 , 27 ) , that regulates their ubiquitin-dependent degradation through the 26S proteasome ( 28-31 ) , or on tyrosine residues of that does not involve its degradation ( 32 ) .
The activated NF- « B dimer then translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of genes such as ICAM-1 involved in inflammatory responses ( 33-35 ) .

Rectangles indicate the location of potential binding sites for tran scription factors AP-1 , AP-2 , and AP-3 , Ets , NF- « B , TRE , Sp-1 , and C/EBP .
The arrow above the initiation codon ATG indicates the translation start site .
Sequence analysis of ICAM-1 promoter has revealed the presence of two NF- « B sites ( 22 , 23 , 36 ) : the upstream NF- « B ( 5'-CGGGAGGATTCCTGGGCC-3 ' , element underlined , within -542 to -524 bases from the translation start site ) and the downstream NF-KB ( 5 element underlined , within -231 to -211 bases from the translation start site ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
In the present study , we demonstrate that thrombin-induced expression of ICAM-1 is regulated at the level of tran-scription , and that this expression is mediated by binding of NF- « Bp65 to the downstream NF-KB site of ICAM-1 promoter .
These data provide evidence linking the activation of the procoagulant , thrombin , to induction of the inflammatory response .
Materials and Methods Cell culture HUVEC were obtained from Clonetics ( La Jolla , CA ) and grown on gel-atin-coated flasks or plates in endothelial cell growth medium ( EGM ) containing 10 % FCS , and 3 mg/m !
of endothelial-derived growth factor from bovine brain extract protein .
Human thrombin with an activity of 3170 NIH U/mg protein was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories ( South Bend , IN ) .
All experiments , except where indicated , were made using cells under eighth passage .
Eahy926 cells , a hybrid cell line of HUVEC and A549 cell line ( derived from human lung epithelial type II cells ) , were provided by Dr. C. J. Edgell ( University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill ) and cultured as described ( 38 ) .
Eahy926 cells retain endothelial morphology and express endothelial cell-specific marker human factor VIII-related Ag ( 38 ) , and upon stimulation with TNF- « these cells also express the endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule E-selectin ( 39 ) .
Confluent HUVEC or Eahy926 cells were starved for 2 h in EGM containing 1-2 % FCS or in RPMI containing 0.5 % FCS , respectively , and were then incubated in the same medium with thrombin or TRAP for the times and at concentrations indicated in each experiment .
Northern blot analysis Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC with RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , Chats-worth , CA ) , according to manufacturer 's recommendations .
Quantification and purity of RNA were assessed by absorption , and an aliquot of RNA ( 20 ug ) from samples with ratio above 1.6 was fractionated using a 1 % agarose formaldehyde gel .
The RNA was transferred to Duralose-UV nitrocellulose membrane ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) and covalently linked by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker ( Stratagene ) .
Human ICAM-1 ( 0.96-kb Sall to Psfl fragment ) ( 40 ) and rat GAPDH ( 1.1-kb Psfl fragment ) were labeled with [ a-* '' P ] dCTP using the random primer kit ( Stratagene ) , and hybridization was conducted as described ( 41 ) .
Briefly , the blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 68°C in QuikHyb solution ( Stratagene ) and hybridized for 2 h at 68°C with random primed *°P-la-beled probes .
After hybridization , the blots were washed twice for 30 min at room temperature in 2X SSC with 0.1 % SDS , followed by two washes for 15 min each at 60°C in 0.1X SSC with 0.1 % SDS .
Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at -70°C for 12-24 h. The signal intensities were quantified by scanning the autoradiograms with a laser densitometer ( Howtek , Hudson , NH ) linked to a computer analysis system ( PDI Imageware Systems , Huntington Station , NY ) .
The nitrocellulose membrane was soaked for stripping the probe with boiled water containing 0.1X SSC with 0.1 % SDS .
Reporter gene constructs , endothelial cell transfection , and luciferase assay The ICAM-1LUC reporter plasmid and its 5° deletion derivatives have been described ( 36 ) .
The constructs containing ~600 bp of ICAM-1 promoter with wild-type ( pGL2-WT ) and mutated versions of Sp-1 ( pGL2- Sp-1-MU , C/EBP ( pGL2-C/EBP-MU ) , and downstream NF- « B site ( pGL2-NF- « B-MU ) ( 22 ) were provided by Dr. Z. Cao ( Tularik , San Fran-cisco , CA ) .
The plasmid pNF- « BLUC containing five copies of consensus NF-KB site linked to a minimal E1B promoter-luciferase reporter gene was purchased from Stratagene .
HUVEC under the fifth passage or Eahy926 cells were plated into six-well Primaria culture dishes 18-24 h before transfection .
Transfections of HUVEC ( except for the experiment shown in Fig .
84 ) were performed using superfect ( Qiagen ) according to manufacturer 's recommendations .
Briefly , reporter DNA ( 1 pug ) was mixed with 5-7.5 ul of superfect in 100 pl serum-free EGM ( Clonetics , La Jolla , CA ) .
We used 0.2 ug pTKRLUC plasmid ( Promega , Madison , WI ) containing Renilla luciferase gene driven by a constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter to normalize transfection efficiencies .
Since we did not observe any significant difference in transfection efficiencies in the initial experiments , we did not cotransfect the pTKRLUC construct in the later experiments .
After a 5-10-min incubation at room temperature , 0.6 ml EGM containing 10 % FCS was added , and the mixture was applied onto the cells that had been washed once with PBS .
Two to three hours later , the medium was changed to EGM containing 10 % FCS and the cells were grown to confluency .
Using this protocol , we achieved a transient transfection efficiency of 11 + 2 % ( mean + SD ; r = 3 ) for HUVEC .
To determine the transfection efficiency , HUVEC were transfected with an expression plasmid pGreen Lantern-1 containing green fluorescence protein gene ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) .
Transfected cells were subjected to FACS analysis for green fluorescence protein expression to determine the transfection effi-ciency .
For transfection of Eahy926 cells , we used lipofectamine ( Life Technologies ) , as described ( 42 ) .
Briefly , reporter DNA ( 1 ug ) was mixed with 2 ul of lipofectamine in 200 gl of Opti-MEM I ( Life Technologies ) .
After a 30-min incubation at room temperature , Opti-MEM I ( 800 pl ) was added , and the mixture was applied onto the cells that had been washed twice with Opti-MEM I .
Three hours later , the medium was changed to RPMI containing 10 % serum and the cells were grown to confluency .
Twelve to 18 h before harvesting cells , the medium was replaced with EGM containing 1 % FCS or RPMI containing 0.1 % FCS , for HUVEC and Eahy926 cells , respectively , and cells were exposed to thrombin ( 2.5 or 5 U/ml ) or TRAP ( 50 uM ) .
Cell extract was prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using Promega Biotech dual luciferase repoter assay system either by TD 20/20 luminometer ( Turner Designs , Sunnyvale , CA ) or Monolight 2010 lumionmeter ( Analytical Luminiscence Laboratory , Ann Arbor , MI ) .
Firefly luciferase activity was determined and expressed as relative light units ( RLU ) /ug of cell protein .
The protein content was determined using a Bio-Rad protein determination kit ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .
Nuclear extract preparation After appropriate treatments , cells were washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ) and resuspended in 400 ul of buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 10 mM KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and 0.5 mM PMSF ) .
After 15 min , Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6 % .
Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 50 pl of buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 0.4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and 1 mM PMSF ) .
After 30 min at 4°C , the lysates were centrifuged and supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were transferred to new vials .
The protein concentration of the extract was measured using a Bio-Rad protein determination kit ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) EMSA were performed as described ( 42 ) .
Briefly , 10 ug of nuclear extract was incubated with 1 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) in a binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HC ] , pH 7.5 , 50 mM NaCl , 0.5 mM DTT , and 10 % glycerol ( 20 pl final volume ) ) for 15 min at room temperature .
Then end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the downstream NF- « B site of ICAM-1 promoter ( 30,000 cpm each ) were added in the absence or presence of 25- or 100-fold molar excess cold competitor , and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature .

Thrombin induces ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cell surface .
Confluent HUVEC monolayers were stimulated with thrombin ( 2.5 U/ml ! )
for 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 h with thrombin ( 2.5 U/ml ! )
or for 12 h with TNF-a ( 100 U/ml ) .
ICAM-1 expression was quantitated by flow cytometry using mAb against ICAM-1 ( BIRRO0O1 ) or mAb against IgG , as described in Materials and Methods .
Comparative FACS profiles of control untreated ( thick line ) , thrombin- , or TNF- « -treated ( dotted line ) cells are shown .
A representative experiment of two performed is shown .
experiments , nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with polyclonal rabbit Ab to human NF- « B proteins ( p65 [ RelA ] , p50 , p52 , c-Rel , and RelB ) ( obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) at a concentration of 2 pl before incubation with the labeled probe for another 15 min at room temperature .
The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 5 % native polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis in low ionic strength buffer ( 0.25 % Tris-borate-EDTA ) .
Oligonucleotides used for the gel shift analysis were as follows : ICAM-1 NF- « B , 5'-AGCTTGGAAATTCCGGAGCTG-3 ' ; mut-ICAM-1 NF-KB , 5-AGC TTecAAATTCCGGAGCTG-3 ' .
The oligonucleotide designated as ICAM-1NF- « B represents a 21-bp sequence of ICAM-1 promoter encompassing the downstream NF-KB binding site located 223 bp upstream of translation initiation site ( 22 , 23 ) .
The oligonucleotide mut-ICAM-1NF-KB is the same as ICAM-1NF-KB , except that it has 2-bp mutations in NF-KB site .
Sequence motifs within the oligonucleotides are underlined and the mutations are shown in lower case .
Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometry analysis was perfomed as described ( 42 ) .
Briefly , HUVEC monolayers in six-well Primaria tissue culture dishes were stimulated with thrombin for various time points .
After completion of incubation period , cells were washed twice with cold PBS , removed by careful trypsinization , and washed again with Ca '' */Mg**-free PBS before incubating with 20 % horse serum for 30 min .
Following two washes , cells were incubated with a mouse mAb directed against human ICAM-1 , BIRROO0O1 ( kindly provided by Dr. Robert Rothlein , Boeringer Ingleheim , Ridgefield , CT ) ( 43 ) , in Ca**/Mg**-free PBS containing 3 % horse serum for 30 min at 4°C .
Cells were then washed twice with PBS/horse serum and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with a goat anti-mouse IgG FITC-conjugated secondary Ab .
Cells were then fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde , and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACScan cytofluorometer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) , and the results were gated for mean fluorescence intensity above the fluorescence produced by the secondary Ab alone .
PMN adhesion assay PMN adhesion assay was performed as described ( 9 ) .
Briefly , confluent HUVEC monolayers in 24-well plates were incubated with thrombin for 2 or 6 h. At the end of each incubation period , HUVEC were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 15 min , and washed three times with DMEM without serum .
The *'Cr-labeled human PMN ( 2 x 10° cells/ml DMEM ) were distributed at 1 ml/well over the HUVEC and co-incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5 % CO ; and 98 % humidity .
To determine the contribution of ICAM-1 in thrombin-induced PMN adherence , HUVEC were treated with RR1/1 ( mAb to ICAM-1 ) 15 min before *'Cr-labeled PMN administration at a concentration of 10 ug/ml .
HUVEC monolayers were then gently washed three times with DMEM without serum to remove the nonadherent PMN .
Endothelial monolayers were kept overnight in 1 ml of 1 N NaQOH at 4°C .
The cell lysates were scraped , collected in polypropylene tubes , and counted for radioactivity in a Tm analytical gamma counter .
Phase-contrast microscopy confirmed HUVEC integrity and PMN adherence to HUVEC .
Results Thrombin induces ICAM-1 cell surface expression and PMN adhesion to HUVEC We previously showed that thrombin increased endothelial adhesivity toward PMN within 0.5 h and that this response was associated with type I activation of ICAM-1 expression , that is , this early response was protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) insensitive and did not require increased ICAM-1 mRNA 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology 50 40 G l= ] 1 PMN Adherence ( % ) bo l= ] 1 10 7 FIGURE 3 .
Thrombin induces endothelial adhesivity toward PMN .
Confluent HUVEC monolayers were pretreated with or without CHX , and then stimulated with thrombin ( 2.5 U/ml ) for 2 or 6 h , washed with DMEM , and fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature , after which unstimulated `` Cr-labeled PMN ( 2 X 10° ) were layered onto endothelial monolayers for 1 h in 1 ml of DMEM with HEPES at 37°C , and adhesion was determined .
In some experiments , thrombin-stimulated HUVEC were preincubated with mAb RR1/1 ( anti-ICAM-1 ) ( 10 g/m ! )

expression ( 9 ) .
To examine whether thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression is initially independent of de novo ICAM-1 protein synthesis , but later becomes protein synthesis dependent , we determined the time course of thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cell surface as assessed by flow cytometry ( Fig .
2 ) .
ICAM-1 expression increased within 6 h of thrombin challenge and continued to increase further at 12 and 24 h ( Fig .
2 ) .
TNF- @ , used as a positive control , also induced cell surface expression of ICAM-1 ( Fig .
2 ) .
The time course of PMN adherence to HUVEC induced by thrombin challenge correlated with the kinetics of ICAM-1 cell surface expression ( Fig .
3 ) .
Approximately 50 % of the increased PMN adherence to HUVEC at 6 h was CHX sensitive ( Fig .
3 ) , consistent with the finding that 50 % of ICAM-1 expression at 6 h was CHX sensitive ( data not shown ) .
The CHX sensitivity of PMN adhesion in the 6-h thrombin-stimulated cells ( Fig .
3 ) was in contrast to the thrombin response at 2 h , which was insensitive to CHX ( 9 ) .
Fig .
3 shows that pretreatment of HUVEC with mAb RR1/1 reduced PMN adherence at 6 h by ~80 % , indicating a role of ICAM-1 in mediating thrombin-induced PMN adhesion .
Given that type I activation of P-selectin and P-selectin-medi-ated PMN adherence is rapid and returns to the basal level within 2 h after thrombin challenge of HUVEC ( 9 ) , it is unlikely that type I activation of P-selectin contributes to 6-h thrombin-induced PMN adherence .
Furthermore , since studies have shown type II activation of P-selectin gene in murine , but not in human , endothelial cells ( 44 , 45 ) , it is unlikely that thrombin mediates type II activation of P-selectin expression , and therefore contributes to 6-h thrombin-induced PMN adherence to HUVEC .
Thus , these data suggest an early protein synthesis-independent ICAM-1 expression induced by thrombin and a delayed and progressive protein synthesis-dependent response , which prolongs and stabilizes PMN adhesion .

Thrombin induces ICAM-1 mRNA expression To determine whether protein synthesis-dependent expression of ICAM-1 is preceded by an increase in ICAM-1 mRNA expression , Northern blot analysis was performed to measure the abundance of ICAM-1 transcript , up to 24 h , after addition of thrombin ( 2.5 to the medium .
Thrombin induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner , with maximum induction occurring between 2 and 4 h after thrombin challenge , followed by a ~55 % decrease at 8 h , and returned to the basal level by 24 h ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
Thrombin-induced ICAM-1 gene transcription requires activation of PAR-1 We evaluated the effects of TRAP , a 14-amino-acid peptide representing the new NH , terminus of PAR-1 generated after thrombin cleavage , to determine whether the induction of ICAM-1 mRNA expression requires activation of PAR-1 .
Both thrombin and TRAP induced the expression of ICAM-1 transcript in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
The 3.3-kb transcript increased slightly with 1 U/ml thrombin or 12.5 wM TRAP ; the maximum induction occurred with 5 U/ml or 50 uM TRAP ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) , indicating that thrombin-induced ICAM-1 transcription occurs secondary to the cleavage of PAR-1 .

Thrombin-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression does not require novel protein synthesis We used CHX to determine whether thrombin induction of ICAM-1 transcript was a direct effect of thrombin treatment or it required the synthesis of additional proteins .
The presence of CHX in the medium during thrombin treatment of HUVEC did not prevent the thrombin-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression ( Fig .
6 ) , suggesting that proteins necessary to mediate thrombin response were already present in cells .
CHX alone caused a slight induction of ICAM-1 transcript ( Fig .
6 ) , a characteristic of NF- « B-dependent genes , since CHX is known to activate nuclear transport of NF- « B , presumably by inhibiting synthesis of relatively labile IB proteins ( 24 ) .
Inhibition of NF- « B activation prevents thrombin-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression To further assess the role of NF-B in mediating ICAM-1 expression by thrombin , we used PDTC , an antioxidant that prevents NF-KB activation , and thereby its translocation to the nucleus through its ability to chelate metal ions and deliver thiol groups to cells ( 46 ) .
Confluent HUVEC monolayers were treated with PDTC for 0.5 h before stimulation with thrombin for 3 h. PDTC pre- vented thrombin-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
7 ) .
These data suggest that reactive oxygen species , produced during inflammatory response , function as second messengers in activating NF- « B and may mediate ICAM-1 transcription in thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells .
Thrombin activates ICAM-1 gene promoter in endothelial cells We assessed the effects of thrombin on transcriptional activity of the ICAM-1 promoter to demonstrate that thrombin was capable of activating ICAM-1 gene transcription .
HUVEC were transfected with a full-length wild-type construct containing 1393 bp of the ICAM-1 promoter linked to the firefly luciferase gene ( ICAM-1 LUC ) .
Thrombin increased ICAM-1 promoter activity ( Fig .
84 ) .
A similar but more pronounced activation by thrombin or TRAP was observed in Eahy926 cells ( Fig .
8B ) .
TNF-a or PMA , used as positive controls , also activated the promoter in these cells ( Fig .
8 , A and B ) .
Since transfection efficiency and the consequent luciferase activity were 2- to 3-fold higher in Eahy926 cells , we used these cells to localize the thrombin-responsive region within the ICAM-1 promoter ( as described below ) .

Localization of thrombin-responsive region within ICAM-1 promoter The ICAM-1 promoter contains a number of cis-acting elements of potential importance in mediating the activation of ICAM-1 gene ( Fig .
1 ) .
We used a set of 5 ' deletion mutation constructs containing different lengths of the ICAM-1 promoter linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene to localize the thrombin-responsive ele-ments .
Deletion of ICAM-1 promoter sequences 393 bp upstream of the ATG start codon decreased basal promoter activity ( Fig .
9 ) .
AP-1 , AP-1/Ets repeats , NF- « B , and AP-3 are the apparent elements in this region , indicating that these sites are important for basal expression of construct 393 ICAM-1 LUC .
However , the expression of this construct was still strongly activated by thrombin and TRAP , indicating that AP-1 , AP-1/Ets , AP-3 , and the upstream NF-B site ( 533 bp upstream of translation start site ) are not essential for thrombin responsiveness ( Fig .
9 ) .
Thrombin responsiveness was lost upon deletion from position 393 to 176 bp , suggesting that cis-regulatory elements responsible for thrombin response reside within this region ( Fig .

for AP-1 ( tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive element ( TRE ) ) , SP1 , C/EBP , and NF-KB transcription factors are located within this region .
Since thrombin is known to stimulate AP-1 DNA binding and AP-1-mediated transactivation ( 47 ) , we used a plasmid containing three copies of TRE from ICAM-1 gene linked to a minimal B-glo-bin promoter-luciferase reporter gene to determine whether TRE could function as the thrombin response element .
As shown in Table I , TRE-directed promoter activity did not increase significantly when the transfected cells were exposed to thrombin or TRAP .
Mutation of downstream NF-KB site prevents thrombin-induced ICAM-1 promoter activation To ascertain the role of Sp-1 , C/EBP , and downstream NF-KB sites in mediating ICAM-1 promoter activation by thrombin , we transfected HUVEC with pGL2-WT and -MU vectors containing wild-type and mutant versions of Sp-1 ( pGL2-Sp-1-MU ) , C/EBP ( pGL2-C/EBP-MU ) , and downstream NF-KB ( pGL2-NF- « B-MU ) site .

10 ) .
However , Sp-1 and C/EBP sites do not appear to be important , as the mutations in these sites failed to prevent thrombin-induced luciferase activity in cells transfected with pGL2-Sp-1-MU and pGL2-C/ EBP-MU vectors .
These results indicate that the downstream NF-KB site is critical in mediating thrombin-induced activation of ICAM-1 promoter .
NF-KB activation is essential to mediate thrombin response To determine whether activation of NF-KB site is necessary to confer thrombin inducibility of ICAM-1 gene , we transfected HUVEC with a plasmid pNF- « BLUC containing five copies of consensus NF-kB sequence from Ig gene linked to a minimal adenovirus E1B promoter-luciferase reporter gene .
As shown in Fig .

These data indicate that NF-KB sequence alone is capable of mediating thrombin response .

We performed competition experiments to determine the specificity of these binding activities .
These DNA-binding activities were competed by specific oligonucleotide probe , ICAM-1NF- « B ( lane 4 ) , yet remained intact when challenged with an oligonucleotide ( mut-ICAM-1NF- « B ) bearing 2-bp substitution in the downstream NF-KB site of ICAM-1 promoter ( Jane 5 ) .
The fast migrating activities ( bands 2 and 3 ) are nonspecific , as evidenced by the appearance of these bands when the same nuclear extract was tested for its ability to bind to the mutant version of downstream NF-KB site ( lane 6 ) .
We next performed supershift experiments using specific Abs to p50 , p65 ( Rel A ) , p52 , c-Rel , and RelB to determine the identity of proteins in the thrombin-induced NF- « B-binding complex .
Incubation with Ab to p65 abolished the slowest migrating complex ( band 1 ) , with a concomitant supershift , but did not affect the fast migrating protein : DNA complexes ( bands 2 and 3 ) ( Fig .

To demonstrate that the failure of p50 or other Abs to elicit a super-shifted complex is the result of the absence of these proteins in the NF- « B complexes interacting at the ICAM-1 NF- « B site rather than the inability of these Abs to supershift under the conditions used , we performed another control experiment in which anti-p50 indeed caused a supershift when mixed with purified p50 protein ( data not shown ) .
Thus , these data indicate that thrombin exposure of HUVEC results in a binding complex ( as evidenced by band 1 ) containing the p65 homodimer .

Lane 1 , no extract .
A representative experiment of four performed is shown .
Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of downstream NF- « B site is necessary for thrombin induction of the ICAM-1 gene .
The inability of CHX , as well as the ability of PDTC to prevent the thrombin-induced increase in ICAM-1 mRNA expression , is consistent with a NF- « B-dependent signaling pathway .
Moreover , the slight induction of ICAM-1 mRNA by CHX alone may be due to inhibition of IxB synthesis by CHX and is characteristic of NF- « B-dependent genes ( 24 ) .
EMSA showed that thrombin induced nuclear NF-KB translocation and DNA-binding activity .
The binding complex consisted of NF-kB p65 ho-modimer , as shown by the supershift experiments .
Inhibition of NF- « B , either by blocking its activation and thereby its nuclear translocation or by mutating the downstream NF- « B site , and thereby preventing binding of activated NF-KB to the ICAM-1 promoter , abolished thrombin-induced increase in ICAM-1 mRNA expression and ICAM-1 promoter activity , respectively .
Studies have shown that NF- « B p65 mediates a number of thrombin-induced cellular responses such as proliferation and cy-tokine production in vascular smooth muscle cells ( 37 , 48 ) .
Activation of NF- « B requires the phosphorylation either on serine or A FIGURE 13 .

Many , if not all , activators of NF- « B induce serine phosphorylation of IB that targets it for rapid polyubiquitination , followed by degradation through 2658 proteasome ( 28-31 ) .
However , in certain settings such as reoxygenation of hypoxic cells , tyrosine phosphorylation of I « Ba leads to NF-KB activation without proteolytic degradation of IxBa ( 32 ) .
We do not exclude any of these possible mechanisms for NF-KB activation following thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells .
The fact that TNF- « or IL-1 activates ICAM-1 expression via NF- « B , coupled with the observation that TNE- & - or IL-B-induced ICAM-1 expression is rapid , with mRNA being detectable as early as 0.5 h , peaking at steady state level by 2 h ( 49 ) as opposed to thrombin-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression , which peaks between 2-4 h , raises the possibility that the thrombin response may be secondary to TNF-a or IL-1 expression .
However , such a possibility is ruled out by the findings that thrombin response was not prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX ( Fig .
6 ) .
In addition , Kaplanski et al .
( 12 ) have recently shown that receptor antagonist , Abs , or antisense oligonucleotides to IL-1 , TNF-a , or IL-1a @ failed to inhibit thrombin-induced E-selectin and IL-8 gene expression in HUVEC .
Furthermore , IL-1 « & , IL-1 $ , and TNF- « @ were not detected in the supernatants of thrombin-activated HUVEC ( 12 ) .
Analysis of ICAM-1 promoter showed that deletion of upstream NF-KB site ( -533 bases from translation start site ) did not prevent the thrombin response .
Thus , we did not examine whether this site can bind p65 homodimer in response to thrombin or TRAP .
We found that the thrombin-responsive region ( spanning from -393 to -176 bases from the start codon ) contained AP-1/TRE , SP1 , C/EBP , and downstream NF- « B binding sites .
Further analysis of this region revealed that TRE by itself is not functionally important for thrombin activation of ICAM-1 gene ; however , we do not exclude the possibility that it may cooperate with other cis-acting elements such as NF- « B to mediate thrombin response .
Interest-ingly , the close arrangement of C/EBP and NF-KB binding sites is reminiscent of the IL-8 gene promoter ( 50 ) .
These sites have also been shown to be critically involved in the mediation of TNF- « signal to the ICAM-1 promoter ( 22 ) .
However , the mutation of C/EBP or Sp-1 site failed to prevent thrombin-induced activation of ICAM-1 promoter , suggesting that these sites are not necessary to confer thrombin inducibility of ICAM-1 gene .
Mutation of downstream NF- « B site , on the other hand , abrogated the response , indicating that the downstream NF-B site is critical for B TNFa - + + ++ + 202 t to + + ++ i led bug ? » 8 i & .9 s 5 & 8 .R § § § 8 1 _ Antibody | - - € € SS # > Free Probe # 1 2 3 4 5 6 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology thrombin-mediated ICAM-1 gene transcription in endothelial cells .
Furthermore , the ability of thrombin to induce NF- « B-mediated activation of a minimal heterologous promoter established that NF- « B is essential for ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells ( Fig .
11 ) .
The downstream NF-KB site is also necessary for hypoxia-in-duced cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) expression in HUVEC .
Human COX-2 promoter is characterized by the presence of two NF- « B sites : the upstream NF- « B site ( 5-GGGGATTCCC-3 ' , -445 bp relative to transcriptional start site ) and the downstream NF- « B site ( 5'-GGGGACTACC-3 ' , -223 bp relative to transcriptional start site ) .
Schmedtj et al .
( 51 ) have reported recently that the downstream NF- « B site of COX-2 promoter is necessary for hy-poxia-mediated COX-2 gene transcription in endothelial cells , whereas the upstream NF- « B site has no effect .
PMN sequestration into the extravascular space is mediated by not only the action of chemotactic agents , but also by PMN adhesion to endothelial cells ( 52 ) .
We and others have shown that thrombin is a potent activator of PMN adhesion to endothelial cells through P-selectin ( CD62P ) and ICAM-1 expression .
However , this phenomenon is rapid ( occurring within 0.5 h ) and does not involve induction of mRNAs for ICAM-1 and P-selectin , and occurred in the presence of CHX ( 9 ) .
In the present study , we demonstrate that the delayed thrombin response ( occurring after 2 h ) resulted in further increase in PMN adhesion and required de novo protein synthesis of ICAM-1 .
Thrombin also induces both IL-8 and E-selectin ( CD62E ) gene expression in endothelial cells , with similar kinetics as that of ICAM-1 ( 12 ) .
It should be noted that in the sequence of adhesion events , E-selectin mediates PMN rolling , whereas ICAM-1 contributes to firm arrest and IL-8 promotes transmigration of PMN across endothelial cells ; hence , the ability of thrombin to induce these genes correlates with the findings that thrombin infusion produced PMN sequestration in pulmonary mi-crovessels secondary to the attachment of PMN to vascular endothelial cells ( 53 , 54 ) .
The resultant vascular injury and tissue inflammation were critically dependent on ICAM-1-mediated PMN adhesion to microvessel endothelial cells ( 55 ) .
In summary , we demonstrate that in addition to its role in intravascular coagulation , thrombin serves as a critical mediator of the inflammatory process through its ability to induce activation of NF- « Bp65 and the expression of ICAM-1 and ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity toward PMN .
Thus , thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression is an important linkage between the coagulation cascade and inflammatory response , which may be important in the mechanism of vascular endothelial adhesivity , PMN adhe-sion , and PMN migration across the endothelial barrier .
