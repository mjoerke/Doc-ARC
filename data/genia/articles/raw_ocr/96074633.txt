Depending on costimulatory signals , SE induce either proliferation or anergy in T cells .
In addition , SE can induce an interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) nonresponsive state and apoptosis .
Here , we show that SE induce dynamic changes in the expression of and signal transduction through the IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) B and y chains ( IL-2R $ and IL-2Ry ) in human antigen-specific CD4* T-cell lines .
Thus , after 4 hr of exposure to SEA and SEB , the expression of IL-2R $ B was down-regulated , IL-2Ry was slightly up-regulated , while IL-2Ra remained largely unaffected .
The changes in the composition of IL-2Rs were accompanied by inhibition of IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Janus protein-tyrosine kinase 3 ( Jak3 ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription called Stat3 and Stat5 .
In parallel experiments , IL-2-driven proliferation was inhibited significantly .
After 16 hr of exposure to SE , the expression of IL-2RB remained low , while that of IL2Ra and IL2Ry was further up-regulated , and ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stat proteins was partly normalized .
Yet , IL-2-driven proliferation remained profoundly inhibited , suggesting that signaling events other than Jak3/Stat activation had also been changed following SE stimulation .
In conclu-sion , our data suggest that SE can modulate IL-2R expression and signal transduction involving the Jak/Stat pathway in CD4* T-cell lines .
The exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus cause toxic shock-like syndromes and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various allergic and autoimmune diseases ( reviewed in ref .
1 ) .
Staphylococcus enterotoxins ( SE ) are among the most potent mitogens for T lymphocytes ( 2 , 3 ) and often are referred to as bacterial superantigens .
SE bind with high affinities to major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) and interact with T cells bearing certain T-cell receptor ( TCR ) variable region B chains ( V ; chains ) ( 4-6 ) .
SE can induce early activation signals , cytokine production , and proliferation of T cells expressing the appropriate TCR V ; chains ( 3 , 7-9 ) .
Addition-ally , SE are able to induce anergy , nonresponsiveness to interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , and programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) in vivo and in vitro ( 10-16 ) .
Costimulatory signals delivered through B7/CD28 and/or lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1/intercellular cell adhesion molecule ( LFA-1/ICAM ) play a critical role in determining the outcome of T-cell stimulation with SE ( 5 , 12 , 17-19 ) .

10995 evidence of an early signaling defect in anergized T cells following TCR stimulation with endogeneous superantigens , chemically fixed APC , or anti-TCR/CD3 antibodies ( 20-24 ) .
However , it is still largely unknown how exposure to SE induces IL-2 nonresponsiveness in T cells .
The high-affinity IL-2R is composed of three distinct chains ( a , B , and y ) of which the B and y chains are essential for efficient signal transduction because of their physical association with intracellular kinases-e.g. , p56 '' ® , raf-1 , and the Janus protein tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3 ( 25-29 ) .
Recently , it was shown that the IL-2R is coupled to the newly described Jak/Stat signaling pathway , where Stat proteins are signal transducers and activators of transcription .
Thus , IL-2R ligation induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak1 and Jak3 and tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat3 , Stat5 , and other Stat-like proteins ( 30-33 ) .
Here , we provide evidence that SE , at least partly , mediate their effect through alterations in the a- , B- , and y-chain composition of IL-2Rs and an uncoupling of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway , rendering T cells nonresponsive to IL-2 .

Proliferative Assays .
Assays were performed in RPMI 1640 culture medium ( GIBCO ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) pooled human serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 100 pg of penicillin and 100 ug of streptomycin ( Novo-Nordisk , Copenha-gen ) per ml in 96-well round-bottom tissue culture plates ( Nunc ) with a final volume of 200 Ll ( 35 , 36 ) .
Twelve hours prior to harvest , [ *H ] Jthymidine [ 1 wCi ( 37 kBq ) per well ) was added .
The cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters , [ *H } thymidine incorporation was measured in a scintillation counter , and the results were expressed as median cpm from triplicate cultures ( 35 , 36 ) .
Preincubation and Stimulation of Cells .
Preincubation with SE .
Cells were incubated in medium containing IL-2 ( 50 units/ml ) and a mixture of SEA ( 1 ug/ml ) and SEB ( 5 ug/ml ) for the indicated periods of time .
Stimulation with IL-2 .
Prior to IL-2 treatment , cells were incubated in IL-2-free medium for 2 hr .
The subsequent stimulation with IL-2 at 500 units/ml was carried out in Eppendorf tubes at 15 X 10° cells per ml for the indicated periods of time .
~ Protein Extraction and Western Blotting .
After treatment with IL-2 and/or SE , the T cells ( 3 x 10° cells per experiment for analysis of total phosphorylation ; 20 x 10° cells per experiment for immunoprecipitations ) were rapidly pelleted , and the reaction was stopped by lysing the cells in ice-cold lysis buffer [ 1 % Nonidet P-40/20 mM Tris , pH 8.0/137 mM NaCl/5 mM MgCI1 ; /10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol containing the following inhibitors : 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM NasVO4 , 10 ug of aprotinin per ml , 4 uM iodoacetamide , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ] .
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were conducted as described ( 30 ) .
Blots were evaluated by enhanced chemiluminescence , stripped , and reprobed according to the manufacturers ' directions ( Amersham ) .
FACS Analysis ( Analysis of Apoptosis and Cell Surface Antigen Expression ) .
Cells were analyzed by indirect immu-nofluorescence ( FACScan , Becton Dickinson ) as described ( 37 ) .
The percentage of positive cells was corrected for background by subtracting the percentage of cells that stained nonspecifically with a nonbinding antibody of similar IgG isotype .
The fraction of apoptotic cells was determined after staining DNA with propidium iodide ( Calbiochem ) by the method described by Vindeloev et al .
( 38 ) , and analysis was performed by the use of a FACScan research software program ( LYSIS I1 ) .
Usually 104 events were analyzed .
A logarithmic scale was used for depicting fluorescence in DNA histo-grams .

RESULTS SE Preincubation Inhibits IL-2-Driven Proliferation .
Upon activation by APC , human T cells synthesize and express MHC class II molecules .
Activated T cells respond to IL-2 by proliferation .
SE binding to MHC class II* allospecific T-cell lines induces tyrosine kinase activity and phosphatidylinositol turnover and may lead to an inhibition of cytokine-driven proliferation ( refs .
8 , 9 , 39 , and 40 and reviewed in ref .
41 ) .
Exposure to a mixture of SEA and SEB induced a profound inhibition of IL-2-driven growth of human allospecific CD4 # * T cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Thus , after 4 hr of SE treatment , the proliferative response was inhibited by > 60 % , whereas 16 hr of SE treatment induced an almost complete block of cytokine-driven proliferation ( Fig .
14 ) .
SE-induced growth inhibition was largely reversed by irradiated APC such as Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line ( EBV-LCL ) Proc .

Effect of SE preincubation on IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation .
( 4 and B ) CD4* T cells ( 5 X 104 cells per well ) were preincubated in medium or a mixture of SEA and SEB ( 1 ug/ml each ) for the indicated periods of time and were washed extensively prior to culture with ( @ ) or without ( 0 ) exogeneous IL-2 at 100 units/ml ( 4 ) or were cocultured with irradiated ( 8000 rad ) , MHC-compatible , EBV-LCL cells ( 25 x 104 per well ) with ( @ ) or without ( 0 ) SEA/SEB at 1 ug/ml each .

( Fig .

In an independent series of experiments , SE treatment induced significant inhibition ( between 61 % and 84 % ) of IL-2-driven proliferation in all of six additional T-cell lines tested ( Fig .
1C , P < 0.05 Willcoxon 's rank sum test ) .
These findings are in accord with a recent report by Damle et al .
( 12 ) that SE treatment of human CD4* T-cell lines induced a state of antigen and cytokine nonresponsiveness that could be abrogated by coculture with EBV-LCL .
SE Inhibition of Proliferation Is Accompanied by Alterations in IL-2R Composition .
In search for a possible explanation for the inhibition of IL-2-induced proliferation , we analyzed the effect of SE on the expression of individual IL-2R chains .
FACS analysis showed that the expression of IL-2Ra , -B , and -y chains was affected differently by SE ( Fig .
2 ) .
Thus , the expression of IL-2R $ chains was down-regulated as early as 1 hr after SE addition and reduced to ~50 % after 16 hr of exposure to SE ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast , the y-chain expression was slightly up-regulated after 4 and 16 hr of SE treatment .
The expression of IL-2R a chains remained relatively constant after 4 hr of SE treatment , whereas an increased IL-2Ra expression could be observed after 16 hr of exposure to SE , indicating that SE induced selective and dynamic changes in the expression of the individual IL-2R chains .
This conclusion was supported by our observation that other surface molecules were also individually affected by SE .
Thus , SE induced a significant up-regulation of intercellular cell-adhesion molecule 1 and downregulation of CDS expression , while the expression of CD38 remained largely unaffected ( Fig .
2 and data not shown ) .

Effect of SE incubation on IL-2R expression .

These data were representative from four independent experiments .
SE Induce Changes in Early IL-2R Signaling .
Because SE induced changes in the relative amount of the individual IL-2R components , we examined whether an altered IL-2R compo- Proc .

USA 92 ( 1995 ) - 10997 sition resulted in changes in receptor signaling .
Recently , it was reported that the B and the a chains , as well as the B and y chains , are able to bind to each other , whereas the y and the a chains can not associate without the B chain being present ( 42 ) .
Thus , the regulation of B-chain expression may be an important mechanism for limiting the response to IL-2 .
To study the early intracellular signaling events , we incubated cells with SE for different periods of time and subsequently stimulated them with medium or IL-2 .
The cells were then lysed , and IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylations were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb .
IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins , the predominant ones being substrates with a molecular weight of ~90-100 kDa ( Fig .
3 ) .
The phosphorylation reached a maximum after 10 min of IL-2 stimulation and declined to the background level after 1 hr ( Fig .
3 , lanes 1-3 ) .
Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins was only weakly inhibited after 1 hr of SE preincubation ( Fig .
3 , lanes 4-6 ) , 4 hr of SE treatment strongly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins ( Fig .
3 , lanes 7-9 ) .
The profound inhibition by SE of IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins was not due to a delay in kinetics , since neither 10 min nor 60 min of IL-2 stimulation induced higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins in question ( Fig .
3 , lanes 7-9 ) .
Surprisingly , T cells had partly regained their tyrosine phosphorylation capacity after 16 hr of SE incubation ( lanes 10-12 ) .
Recently , it was shown that the IL-2 receptor is coupled to the newly identified JAK/Stat signaling pathway-i.e. , IL-2 stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat3 and Stat5 proteins in human T cells ( 30 , 32 , 33 ) .
These Stat proteins have molecular weights similar to those of the proteins affected by SE treatment ( Fig .
3 ) .
Accordingly , we examined whether the JAK/Stat signaling pathway was defective in SE-treated cells .
To investigate this , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 was measured in cells treated with SE or medium for 4 hr ( Fig .
44 Upper ) .
Whereas IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 in medium-treated cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , IL-2 induced weak , barely detectable levels of Jak3 tyrosine phosphorylation in SE-treated cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The defective Jak3 activation was not caused by degradation of the kinase , since the amount of Jak3 precipitated was not decreased after SE treatment ( Fig .
44 Lower ) .
Thus , in addition to ( or as a consequence of ) the effect on IL-2RB-chain expression , SE seemed to inhibit Jak3 activation .
The JAK kinases are believed to be the immediate activators of Stat proteins , and we therefore examined whether the activation of Stat proteins was also inhibited in the SE-treated cells .
Indeed , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat3 and Stat5 was decreased after 4 hr of exposure to SE ( Fig .
4B , compare lanes 1-4 and lanes 5-8 ) .

SE-Induced Anergy/Apoptosis Can not Be Reversed by IL-2 .
In a recent report , the IL-2Ry chain and Jak3 have been proposed to be involved in IL-2-mediated conversion of ( res-cue from ) anergy and apoptosis ( 43 ) .
In the present study , the expression of IL-2Ry was increased following SE treatment ( Fig .
2 ) and , although IL-2-induced Jak3 tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited , the level of Jak3 was not decreased .
Therefore , we investigated whether SE-induced apoptosis could be reversed by IL-2 .
Accordingly , after 4 hr of exposure to SE or medium , T cells were cultured with exogeneous IL-2 for another 24 or 48 hr prior to flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis .
SE induced only little apoptosis after 4 hr of preincubation ( Fig .
5 ) , whereas a significant increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells could be seen after 24 and 48 hr .
Thus , after 48 hr of culture with IL-2 , the fraction of apoptotic cells was approximately 3 times higher in SE-treated cultures than in parallel cultures without SE ( Fig .
5 ) .
This observation is in accordance with other data showing that SE-induced anergy/apoptosis can not be reversed by IL-2 ( 12 , 44 ) .
Our findings that SE-treated cells express little IL-2R $ chain and are defective in activating Jak3 could explain why SE-induced anergy and apoptosis could not be reversed by exogeneous It is well-known that withdrawal of IL-2 from activated T cells induces a massive apoptotic response ( reviewed in ref .
45 ) .
We also found high levels of apoptosis in IL-2-starved cultures ( 58 % apoptosis , data not shown ) .
SE preincubation prior to IL-2 starvation induced 70-80 % apoptosis , suggesting that SE might ( also ) modulate other pathways involved in the regulation of cell survival and/or apoptosis .
DISCUSSION In the present study , we provide evidence that SE induce dynamic and selective changes in the expression of individual IL-2R chains expressed by human , antigen-specific , MHC class : Fig .

II-positive CD4* T-cell lines .
SE-induced changes in the composition of IL-2Rs were accompanied by profound changes in ligand-induced receptor signaling .
Thus , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stat3 and Stats transcription factors was profoundly inhibited after 4 hr of exposure to SE .
Since both the B and the y chains bind Jak3 upon IL-2 ligation ( 29 ) , the influence of an altered IL-2R composition on receptor signaling was difficult to predict .
Interestingly , y and a chains can not associate without the B chain being involved , indicating that the IL-2R B chain is a critical regulator of the response ( 42 ) .
Our observation that ligand-induced Jak3 phos-phorylation , despite an upregulation of IL-2Ry , was profoundly inhibited by a 50 % reduction in the expression of supports the assumption that the IL-2R $ 8 chain plays a key role in the regulation of IL-2R signal transduction .
After 16 hr of exposure to SE , however , ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stat proteins was partly normalized despite a continued low IL-2RB expression , suggesting that other factors may also influence receptor signaling .
Thus , the up-regulation of IL-2Ra expression after 16 hr of SE treatment might indirectly enhance signaling through the remaining and -y complexes .
An alternative , but not mutually exclusive explanation might be that exposure to SE induced changes in additional intracellular signaling pathways .
In support of this possibility , profound signaling defects have been described in T cells rendered anergic following stimulation through the TCR-CD3 complex ( 20-24 ) .
Since TCR-CD3 mAb and SE did not induce activation of Jak3 and Stat proteins per se ( ref .
31 and data not shown ) , JAK/Stat inhibition was not simply a matter of substrate competition or depletion .
Anergized murine T cells have an altered expression of p56 '' and p59 % Y '' and exhibit altered tyrosine phosphorylation of additional substrates following antigen receptor stimulation ( 23 , 24 , 46 ) .
Furthermore , changes in the activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 , NF- « B , and NF-AT have been observed in anergic cells ( 21 , 47 ) .
Since some of these kinases and transcription factors- e.g. , p56 '' * and NF- « B-are also involved in IL-2R signaling and proliferation , it is possible that an interference by SE with these signaling molecules might play a role in SE-induced IL-2 nonresponsiveness .
Interestingly , proliferative responses to IL-2 remained profoundly inhibited after 16 hr of SE treatment .
Yet , IL-2R ligation induced subnormal but significant tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stat proteins .
Taken together these observations suggest that Jak3/Stat activation may not be sufficient for receptor-induced proliferation .
This conclusion was supported by a recent report from Fujii et al .
( 48 ) that deletions in the IL-2R that blocked ligand-induced Stat5 phosphorylation did not block IL-2-driven growth .
It remains to be seen how crosstalk takes place between SE receptors and IL-2 receptors and their associated signaling molecules .
Herbimycin A , an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases , Immunology : Nielsen et al .
could only partly inhibit SE-induced down-regulation of IL2RB chains ( data not shown ) , suggesting that tyrosine kinase-dependent and -independent receptor crosstalk might play a role in SE-induced IL-2R modulation .
Since cyclosporin A was reported to inhibit SE-induced apoptosis in human CD4* T-cell lines ( 12 ) , it is likely that the calcineurin-calmodulin pathway may participate in crosstalk between SE and IL-2 receptor-associated signaling pathways .
MHC class II-positive T cells bind SE with high affinity , whereas resting class II-negative T cells do not ; therefore , MHC class II molecules are believed to be the principal SE receptors on T cells .
However , both MHC class II and TCR/ CD3 molecules play a critical role in the early signaling events after exposure of T-cell lines to SE ( 9 ) .
Indeed , circumstantial evidence suggests that bridging of MHC class II and TCR/ CD3 molecules in cis by SE or mAb generates enhanced early signaling events as compared with separate ligation of MHC and TCR/CD3 molecules ( 9 , 49 ) .
These observations might explain why SE are much more potent inducers of IL-2 nonresponsiveness and apoptosis than are anti-TCR/CD3 mAbs ( unpublished observations ) .
Taken together , our results show that SE modulate the expression and composition of IL-2R and interfere with ligand-induced activation of the JAK/Stat signal pathway .
This ability of SE to down-regulate cytokine receptor signaling and proliferation and to induce apoptosis has potential implications in the pathogenesis in AIDS .
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individuals are thus prone to harbor infections , including those capable of producing SE .
Exposure of activated , antigen-specific , MHC class II-positive T cells to SE may induce nonresponsiveness and apoptosis in HIV-infected individuals and thus contribute to and aggravate the immunodeficiency and depletion of CD4* T cells associated with AIDS .
