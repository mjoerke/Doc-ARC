Shevach ' 'Laboratory of Immunology , National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD 20892 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , National Institutes of Health Research Scholars Program , Bethesda , MD 20814 Abstract Interleukin ( IL ) -18 has been well characterized as a costimulatory factor for the induction of IL-12-mediated interferon ( IFN ) -y production by T helper ( Th ) 1 cells , but also can induce IL-4 production and thus facilitate the differentiation of Th2 cells .
To determine the mechanisms by which IL-18 might regulate these diametrically distinct immune responses , we have analyzed the role of cytokines in the regulation of IL-18 receptor a chain ( IL-18Ra ) expression .
The majority of peripheral CD4* T cells constitutively expressed the IL-18Rax .
Upon antigen stimulation in the presence of IL-12 , marked enhancement of IL-18Rax expression was observed .
IL-12-mediated upregulation of IL-18Ra required IFN-y .
Activated T cells that expressed low levels of IL-18Ra could produce IFN-y when stimulated with the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 , while CD4* cells which expressed high levels of IL-18Ra could respond to IL-18 alone .
In contrast , T cell stimulation in the presence of IL-4 resulted in a downregulation of IL-18Ra expression .
Both IL-4~ '' ~ and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 6~ '' ~- T cells expressed higher levels of IL-18Ra after TCR stimulation .
Furthermore , activated T cells from Stat6~'~ mice produced more IFN-y in response to IL-18 than wild-type controls .
Thus , positive/negative regulation of the IL-18Ra by the major inductive cytokines ( IL-12 and IL-4 ) determines the capacity of IL-18 to polarize an immune response .
Key words : Introduction IL-18 is an 18-kD cytokine originally described as IFN-y-inducing factor for its ability to augment IFN-y production by activated T cells ( 1 ) .
Subsequently , IL-18 has been regarded as a proinflammatory cytokine that can synergize with IL-12 to increase IFN-y production , NK cell cytotoxicity , and Th1 responses ( 2-5 ) .
While IL-18 clearly enhances Th1 responses , it is less clear whether IL-18 is capable of initiating Th1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12 ( 6-10 ) .
Although a majority of published reports link IL-18 with Thi-associated functions , IL-18 has recently been shown to augment Th2 responses ( 11-14 ) .
Administration of IL-18 to mice led to an increase in IL-4 production and elevated serum IgE .
The mechanisms whereby IL-18 can influence both Th1 and Th2 responses are unclear at this time .

IL-18Ra ( IL-1R5 ) was originally described as IL-1 receptor-related protein ( IL-1Rrp ) because of its homol-ogy with the IL-1/Toll receptor family and is the extracellular binding domain of the IL-18R complex .
IL-18RB ( also known as IL-18RAcPL or IL-1R7 ) is the signal trans-ducing chain of the IL-18R complex and is also a member of the IL-1R family .
It has been widely believed that the IL-18Ra is not expressed on naive T cells , but is induced during differentiation of Th1 , but not Th2 , cells .
Here , we have used a recently developed polyclonal antibody to IL-18Ra to investigate regulation of its expression on differentiating CD4*+* T cells .
In contrast to previous studies , we demonstrate that resting peripheral CD4* and CD8* T *Abbreviations used in this paper : IL-18Ra , IL-18 receptor @ chain ; MFI , mean fluorescence intensity ; NMS , normal mouse serum ; RAG , recombination activating gene ; Stat , signal transducer and activator of transcription .

Although it has been proposed that IL-12 alone may upregulate expression of the IL-18Ra , culture of naive CD4* T cells in IL-12 or IL-18 alone had no effect on IL-18Ra expression .
However , activation of T cells via the TCR in the presence of IL-12 , but not IL-18 , resulted in marked upregulation of IL-18Ra expression .
The combination of IL-18 and IL-12 further enhanced IL-18Ra expression during TCR activation .
Although IFN-y did not directly regulate IL-18Ra expression , IL-12-mediated upregulation of IL-18Ra was not observed in the absence of IFN-y .
After activation in the presence of IL-12 , the capacity of CD4¢* T cells to produce IFN-y in response to IL-18 alone correlated with their expression of high levels of the IL-18Ra .
In sharp contrast , the combination of TCR ligation and IL-4 led to a marked downregulation of IL-18Ra on unprimed CD4* T cells .
The downregulatory effects of IL-4 on were completely dependent on expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 6 .
Collectively , these results demonstrate that IL-18Ra expression is finely regulated during the course of CD4+* T cell differentiation along either the Th1 or Th2 pathways .
They are most consistent with a model in which IL-12/IFN-y play a critical function in upregulation of IL-18Ra expression during differentiation along the Th1 pathway , while IL-4 plays a downregulatory role on IL-18Ra during Th2 differentiation .
These data are critical to furthering our understanding of the proposed dual role of IL-18 as a differentiation factor for both Th1 and Th2 responses as well as its possible therapeutic use as an adjuvant .
Materials and Methods Animals .
- Female C57BL/6 , C57BL/6 IFN-y~'~- , C57BL/6 IL-4~ '' ~ mice , and 5CC7 B10.A/Ai recombination activating gene ( RAG ) -2~ '' ~ mice expressing a TCR transgene specific for cytochrome C were obtained from Taconic Farms and used at 4-8 wk of age .
Female BALB/c and Stat6~'~ ( C129S2-Stat6 ) mice were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories .
All animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and provided food and water ad libitum .
Animals were maintained according to National Institutes of Health Animal Care Guidelines .
Cell Lines .
- Short-term polarized T cell lines were established as follows : CD4* T cells were isolated from lymph nodes of 5CC7 RAG-2~ '' ~ mice by negative selection using FITC-labeled anti-B220 , anti-CD8 , and anti-I-A* , followed by anti-FITC magnetic separation .
Purity of CD4* population was confirmed by FACS® analysis .
CD4+* T cells ( 10° cells per milliliter ) were stimulated in vitro for 4-5 d with T cell-depleted , irradiated B10.A APCs ( 10 % cells per milliliter ) and 1 pM cytochrome C peptide in IL-2-supplemented media containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , L-glutamine , antibiotics , and B-mercaptocethanol .
To establish Th1 lines , IL-12 ( 10 ng/ml ; R & D Systems ) and anti-IL-4 ( 10 pg/ml 11B11 ) were added to cultures .
For Th2 lines , IL-4 ( 1,000 U/ml ) , anti-IL-12 ( 10 pg/ml €17.8 ) , and anti-IFN-y ( 10 g/ml XMG 1.2 ) were added .
Th `` null '' cells were established by the addition of anti-IL-12 , anti-IL-4 , and anti-IFN-y antibodies .
After 4-5 d , cells were washed and resuspended in fresh IL-2 media for an additional 48 h ( 21 ) .
In some experiments , splenic CD4* T cells from wild-type C57BL/6 or IFN-y~'~ mice were cultured ( 4 X 10° cells per milliliter ) with plate-bound anti-CD3 ( 5 pg/ml 2C11 ; BD PharMingen ) and IL-2 ( with or without rIL-12 , fIL-18 , 1IL-4 , rIL-10 , rh for 48 h. Cells were washed , then resuspended in fresh IL-2 media ( with or without fresh cytokine added ) for an additional 48 h before FACS® analysis .
Flow Cytometry .
Cells were washed twice in PBS , resuspended in PBS , and placed ( 1-2 X 10° cells ) into individual wells of a 96-well V-bottomed Costar plate .
The cells were first incubated for 5 min at 4°C with 1 jug of rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 ( Fc block ; BD PharMingen ) to block nonspecific binding of goat Ig/anti-IL-18Ra antibody to Fc receptors .
Cells were then incubated with either 1 pg of goat IgG or 1 jug of goat anti-murine IL-18Ra ( R & D Systems ) diluted in PBS containing 5 % normal mouse serum ( PBS-NMS ) .
Anti-IL-18Ra is an affinity-purified , polyclonal goat-specific IgG antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain ( peptide 19-326 ) of recombinant murine IL-18Ra .
Cells were incubated with the respective antibody for 30 min , 4°C , washed two times with PBS , incubated in PBS-NMS for 10 min , and then stained with SP-biotinylated mouse anti-goat IgG ( H plus L ) diluted in PBS-NMS ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) for 20 min .
Cells were subsequently washed two times in PBS and then resuspended in streptavidin-PFE ( BD PharMingen ) diluted in PBS .
After a 10-min incubation at 4°C , FITC-labeled anti-CD4 ( BD PharMingen ) was added directly to wells for an additional 20-min incubation at 4°C .
Cells were again washed two times in PBS and resuspended in PBS .
7-AAD was added immediately before FACS® analysis to exclude dead cells from analysis .
Analysis was performed using software ( Becton Dickinson } .
Data are presented as the difference ( A ) between the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) of the positive stain ( anti-IL-18Ra ) and the MFI of the negative control ( goat Ig ) .
Cytokine Assays .
T cells that had been primed in vitro for 4-7 d under various polarizing conditions were resuspended in fresh IL-2 medium .
Cells ( 10° cells per milliliter ) were cultured in 24-well plates for 48 h with 10 ng/ml IL-12 , 30 ng/ml IL-18 , or both .
Cell-free supernatants were collected and levels of IFN-y determined by ELISA ( R & D Systems ) .
Alternatively , primed cells were restimulated with either immobilized anti-CD3 ( 5 pg/ml 2C11 ; BD PharMingen ) or IL-12 and IL-18 ( as above ) for 6-8 h , and monensin was added for the final 4 h of culture .
Cells were harvested , permeabilized with saponin/PBS buffer , then stained for intracellular IFN-y and IL-4 .
Results Naive T Cells Express the IL-18Ra .
In contrast to previous studies which only detected the IL-18Ra on fully differentiated Th1 cells ( 22 ) , a majority ( 82 + 2 % ) of both CD4* and CD8 # + splenic T cells from C57BL/6 mice were reactive by FACS® analysis with the polyclonal antibody to recombinant IL-18Ra ( Fig .
1 , A and C ) .
In multiple experiments ( # = 5 ) of this type the AMFI of IL-18Ra « expression on freshly explanted CD4+* T cells was 143 + 11 .
CD4¢* and CD8+* T cells in lymph node expressed levels of IL-18Ra similar to that seen in spleen ( data not shown ) .
We also detected high levels of IL-18Ra on mature CD4* and CD8* single positive T cells in the thymus , while CD4*CD8+* double positive thymocytes expressed rela- 144 __ Regulation of IL-18 Receptor Expression tively low levels ( data not shown ) .
Thus , expression of the IL-18Ra appears to be acquired during the process of T cell differentiation in the thymus .
Constitutive expression of the IL-18Ra was independent of either IL-12 or IFN-y as the level of expression of the IL-18Ra on CD4* cells from IL-12~ '' ~ or IFN-y~ '' ~- mice was identical to CD4* T cells from wild-type mice ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of other cell types revealed low levels of IL-18Ra expression on B220¢+ splenic B cells ( Fig .
1 D ) , while the highest level of IL-18Ra expression was found on NK1.1* cells ( Fig .
1 E ) .
We consistently identified a small population ( ~6-10 % ) of splenic CD4* cells that expressed high levels of the IL- A M1i= A156 M2= A1072 Counts 0 20 40 60 $ 0 100 ® 7 9 j M1= A136 28-7 J. is ) `` Af \ | o~ kt \ 53,4 h. © `` ' _ ‘ 1'.n mbr .

Spleen cells were pooled from naive mice and analyzed for expression by FACS® .
Analysis was gated on 7-AAD~ cells only ( i.e .

18Ra ( Fig .
1 A , M2 , MFI 1,072 + 286 ) .
This IL-18Ra® population was absent in the spleens of 5CC7 TCR transgenic mice on a RAG-2~ '' ~ background ( Fig .
1 B , arrow ) , suggesting the CD4* IL-18Ra® '' '' population in the former could be a population of previously activated/memory T cells or CD4*NK1.1+* T cells .
Further analyses revealed the majority ( ~90 % ) of CD4* IL-18Ra '' cells are NK1.1~ and express markers typically associated with memory/acti-vated T cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , two distinct levels of IL-18Ra expression ( IL-18Ra ' '' * and IL-18Ra '' ) can be detected on CD4* T cells in spleens from normal animals .
Stimulation with IL-12 or IL-18 Alone Does Not Lead to Upregulation of IL-18Ra on CD4* IL-18Ra & '' ® T Cells , Previous reports have suggested that IL-12 in the absence of TCR stimulation was capable of inducing IL-18Ra « expression , thus enabling IL-18 to synergize with IL-12 to enhance IFN-y production ( 23 ) .
To evaluate the effects of cytokines on IL-18Ra expression , we cultured spleen cells from normal C57BL/6 mice for 96 h in IL-2-containing media alone or in IL-2-containing media supplemented with either IL-12 or IL-18 .
Preliminary studies demonstrated that IL-2 was required to maintain adequate viability of the cells .
Culture with IL-2 alone led to a decrease in IL-18Ra expression on CD4* IL-18Ro* cells ( Fig .
1 A , M1 , MFI 143 + 21 ; and Fig .
2 A , M1 , MFI 94 + 15 ) , but did not modify the level of expression of IL-18Ra on the subpopulation of IL-18Ra '' cells ( Fig .
1 A , M2 , MFI 1,088 + 109 ; and Fig .
2 A , M2 , MFI 1,072 + 286 ) .
However , it should be noted that culture in IL-2 alone did result in a marked increase in the percentage of the IL-18Ra® population from 6-10 % to ~20-40 % of CD4* T cells during the 96-h culture ( Figs .
1 A and 2 A ) .
This increase presumably reflects the preferential expansion of previously activated/memory T cells in the presence of IL-2 .
Slight upregulation of IL-18Ra expression on the CD4* IL-18Ra'* cells was observed in the presence of IL-12 ( MFI 102 + 12 ) , but not IL-18 ( Fig .
2 , B-D , M1 , MFI 88 + 13 ) .
In striking contrast , the minor population of CD4* IL-18Ra '' cells upregulated IL-18Ra expression in response to IL-12 ( Fig .
2 B , M2 , MFI 2,425 + 1,074 ) , but not IL-18 ( Fig .
2 C , M2 , MFI 1,029 + 171 ) .
Thus , the primary effects of IL-12 on freshly explanted CD4* T cells from normal animals appear to be via upregulation of the IL-18Ra on the minor population of CD4* T cells that already express high levels of this receptor and which appear to be memory T cells .
IL-12 in Concert with TCR Stimulation Induces Upregulation of IL-18Ra Expression on CD4* T Cells .
To examine the effects of TCR stimulation on IL-18Ra expression , CD4* T cells from naive C57BL/6 mice were stimulated for 2 d with immobilized anti-CD3 in IL-2-containing media , with or without IL-12/IL-18 .
After 2 d in culture , the cells were harvested , washed , and placed into fresh IL-2 media with fresh cytokines for an additional 2 d. This two-step culture system was used because significant apoptosis was observed when T cells were cultured for 4 d on plate-bound anti-CD3 .

2 A , M1 with Figs .
3 A and 1 A ) .
However , the addition of IL-12 to anti-CD3-stimulated cultures led to marked upregulation of IL-18Ra « expression ( Fig .
3 B ) , while the addition of IL-18 alone did not result in enhanced IL-18Ra expression ( Fig .
3 C ) .
IL-18 did synergize with IL-12 to enhance IL-18Ra expression ( Fig .
3 D ) .
Resting CD4¢* T cells failed to produce IFN-y on exposure to IL-12 , IL-18 , or the combination of IL-12/IL-18 ( data not shown ) .
However , after anti-CD3 induced T cell activation , large amounts of IFN-y were produced in response to IL-12/IL-18 irrespective of the priming conditions ( Fig .
3 , E-H ) .
More importantly , the upregulation of IL-18Ra expression seen when T cells were cultured with IL-12 correlated with the ability of IL-18 to induce IFN-y production in the absence of IL-12 ( Fig .
3 , F and H ) .
T cells primed with IL-2 ( Fig .
3 E ) or IL-18 ( Fig .
3 G ) did not produce detectable IFN-y when cultured with IL-18 alone .
Regulation of IL-18Ra Expression by IFN-y .
- As IFN-y is induced by IL-12 , it was possible that IL-12-mediated upregulation of the IL-18Ra « was secondary to IFN-y production .
To test this , we stimulated T cells from IFN-y~'~ mice with anti-CD3 and IL-2 .
After 4 d of culture , CD4* T cells from IFN-y~ '' ~- mice expressed levels of IL-18Ra that were similar to wild-type C57BL/6 mice ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
Therefore , the mere absence of IFN-y does not lead to downregulation of IL-18Ra expression .
However , IL-12-dependent upregulation of IL-18Ra expression was severely impaired in the absence of IFN-y .
A majority of CD4+* T cells from IFN-y~'~ upregulate IL-18Ra expression when cultured with anti-CD3 and IL-12 ( M1 ; Fig .
4 , C and D ) .
Addition of IFN-y to these cultures restored IL-12-driven upregulation of mice failed to 146 IL-18Ro-PE M1=A95 M2=A1624 7 wal +IL-12 108 - 10 '' MI1=A102 Figure 2 .

- IL-12-mediated enhancement of IL-18R « expression is IFN-y dependent .
Spleen cells from wild-type C57BL/6 ( A and C ) and IFN-y ~~ ( B-F ) mice were stimulated for 2 d with plate-bound anti-CD3 and IL-2 ( A and B ) alone , or with IL-2 and IL-12 ( C and D ) , IFN-y ( E ) , or IL-12 and IFN-y ( F ) .
After 2 d , cells were washed and placed into fresh IL-2 media with fresh cytokine for an additional 2 d. Cells were then stained for IL-18Ra « expression .
IL-18Ra ; however , IFN-y itself did not enhance IL-18Ra expression in the absence of IL-12 ( M1 ; Fig .
4 , E and F ) .
These data demonstrate that IFN-y is required for IL-12-mediated upregulation of IL-18Ra expression and most likely functions by inducing/maintaining IL-12RB2 expression .
However , we consistently observed a minor population of T cells that could upregulate their IL-18Ra in an IL-12-dependent but IFN-y-independent fashion ( M2 ; Fig .
4 , B and D-F ) .
We suspect these are memory T cells , based on our observations that memory cells can upregulate their IL-18Ra expression in response to IL-12 alone ( Fig .
2 , A-D ) .
IL-4 in Concert with TCR Stimulation Induces Downregulation of IL-18Ra .
- While previous studies have focused on IL-12 and its ability to augment IL-18 responses , very little is known about the cytokines which may negatively regulate IL-18Rax expression .
Therefore , we stimulated C57BL/6 CD4+* T cells with anti-CD3/IL-2 in the presence of IL-4 , IL-10 , or TGEF-B .
IL-4 markedly enhanced the downregulation of IL-18Ra expression observed when T cells were cultured with anti-CD3 and IL-2 ( Fig .
5 , A , B , I , and K ) .
While the addition of IL-10 had no effect ( Fig .
5 C ) , the addition of TGF-B augmented IL-18Ra expression ( Fig .
5 D ) .
Although T cells primed in the presence of IL-4 or IL-10 expressed detectable levels of the IL-18Ra , they failed to secrete IFN-y in response to IL-18 alone ( Fig .
5 , F and G ) .
However , these cells were capable of producing significant quantities of IFN-y when cultured with both IL-12 and IL-18 ( Fig .
5 , F-H ) .
Because these studies were performed without concomitant neutralization of IL-12 and/or IFN-y , it is possible that the inability of IL-4 to completely inhibit IFN-y induction by IL-12 and IL-18 is due to endogenous IL-12/IFN-y .
147 Smeltz et al .
Because the addition of exogenous IL-4 was capable of downregulating IL-18Rax , we suspected that endogenous IL-4 was partially responsible for the downregulation of IL-18Ra observed with anti-CD3 stimulation in the absence of any added cytokine ( Fig .
5 A ) .
To test this hypothe-sis , we stimulated T cells from IL-4~ '' ~ mice and measured expression .
When compared with wild-type C57BL/6 mice , IL-4C '' ~ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of IL-18Ra after anti-CD3 stimulation ( Fig .
5 , I and J ) .
Levels of IL-18Ra expression before stimulation were comparable for both C5S7BL/6 and IL-4~ '' ~ , mice ( data not shown ) .
However , the addition of exogenous IL-4 resulted in a downregulation of IL-18Ra that was comparable to that seen with wild-type cells ( Fig .
5 , K and L ) .
These results confirm a critical role for IL-4 in downregulation of IL-18Ra .
Requirement for Stat6 in Regulation of IL-18Ra Expression / Function on CD4* T Cells .
Because IL-4 signals mainly via Stat6 , we determined if Stat6 signaling was required for IL-4-induced downregulation of IL-18Ra after T cell activation .
After stimulation with anti-CD3 and IL-2 , CD4¢* T cells from Stat6 '~ mice expressed higher levels of IL-18Ra ( AMFI = 208 ) compared with wild-type T cells ( AMFI = 93 ; Fig .
6 , A and D ) .
This suggests that endogenous Stat6 signaling partially contributes to anti-CD3-induced downregulation of IL-18Rax , which is consistent with the results obtained with IL-4~ '' ~ mice ( Fig .
5 , I-K ) .
In contrast to the downregulatory effects of IL-4 seen with wild-type T cells ( Fig .
6 B ) , the addition of IL-4 to cultures of CD4+* T cells from Stat6~ '' ~ mice had no effect on IL-18Ra expression ( Fig .
6 E ) indicating that Stat6 is required for IL-4-mediated downregulation of IL-18Ra expression .

IL-4 induces downregulation of IL-18R « in response to stimulation with anti-CD3 .
CD4* T cells from wild-type C57BL/6 ( A-I and K ) or IL-4~ '' ~ ( J and L ) mice were stimulated for 2 d with plate-bound anti-CD3 and IL-2 alone ( A , E , I , and J ) , or with IL-2 and IL-4 ( B , F , K , and L ) , IL-10 ( C and G ) , or TGF-B ( D and H ) .
The cells were then washed and placed into fresh IL-2 media with fresh cytokine for an additional 2 d. Cells were then stained for IL-18Ra « expression ( A-D and I-L ) .
Alternatively , cells were restimulated with IL-12 , IL-18 , or both IL-12 and IL-18 , and supernatants were tested for IFN-y production .
pression was significantly enhanced in the absence of Stat6 ( Fig .
6 , C and F ) .
To correlate the differences in receptor expression with the ability of IL-18 to induce IFN-y production , anti-CD3-primed T cells from both BALB/c and Statb~'~ mice were restimulated with either immobilized anti-CD3 or cytokine and subsequently stained for intracellular IFN-y .
T cells from Stat6~'-mice produced more IFN-y in response to anti-CD3 stimulation , as well as the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 ( Fig .
6 , G-K ) .
Importantly , IL-18-induced IFN-y production was significantly enhanced in Staté~'~ mice ( 13 vs. 7 % , Fig .
6 J ) , which is consistent with the higher levels of IL-18Ra expression observed on Stat6b~'~ mice ( Fig .
6 D ) .
These results suggest that IL-4 and Stat6 are critical regulators of both IL-18Ra expression and IL-18 responsiveness .
CD4* T Cells Primed under Th1 Conditions Upregulate IL-18Ra .
Since we found that all naive CD4* T cells expressed the IL-18Rax , it was of interest to examine the ki-netics of regulation of expression during the differentiation of naive CD4+* T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells .
For this purpose , we used T cells from 5CC7 transgenic mice on the RAG-2~ '' ~ background to minimize the number of previously activated T cells in the starting population .
Th1 cells were generated by culturing purified CD4* T cells with APCs , antigen , IL-12 , and anti-IL-4 as described previously ( 21 ) .
After 1 wk in culture , the cells were restimulated with antigen and APCs .
Intracellular cytokine staining revealed that 45 % of 1-wk ( 1X ) Th1 cells expressed IFN-y ( Fig .
7 A ) .
No IL-4 could be detected in this population .
1-wk Th1 cells expressed high levels of IL-18Ra before restimulation ( Fig .
7 D ) , but these levels increased upon stimulation with APCs and antigen ( Fig .
7 G ) .
Upon re-stimulation , Th1 cells secreted large amounts of IFN-y after culture with IL-12 and IL-18 , but also secreted significant amounts of IFN-y when cultured with IL-18 alone ( Fig .
7 J ) .
The null cells were generated by priming with peptide , APCs , and IL-2 in the presence of anti-IL-4 , anti-IL-12 , and anti-IFN-y antibodies .
Although these cells proliferated vigorously when restimulated with peptide and APCs , they failed to differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells as judged by the lack of intracellular staining for IFN-y or IL-4 ( Fig .
7 B ) .
The level of IL-18Ra on Th null cells after 1 wk of culture and restimulation was similar to that seen on unstimulated CD4* T cells ( Figs .
7 , E and H , and 1 A ) .
Thus , neither IL-12 nor IFN-y is required for maintenance of the basal level of IL-18Ra expression during the 1-wk priming period .
These results are consistent with those obtained with anti-CD3-stimulated T cells from IFN-y~ '' ~- ( Fig .
4 ) and IL-12~ '' ~ , ( data not shown ) mice .
Interestingly , Th null cells failed to produce IFN-y when restimulated with IL-12 or IL-18 alone , but did respond to the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 ( Fig .
7 K ) .
CD4* T Cells Primed under Th2 Conditions Rapidly Down-regulate IL-18Ra Expression .
The results obtained with Th1 cells ( Fig .
7 ) are consistent with the observation that terminally differentiated Th1 cells express high levels of IL-18Ra .
To understand the dynamics of IL-18Ra during Th2 differentiation , TCR transgenic CD4* T cells were cultured in the presence of antigen , APCs , IL-4 , anti-IL-12 , and anti-IFN-y .
After 1 wk of priming , 22 % of the cells expressed intracellular IL-4 , but not IFN-y , when restimulated with antigen and APCs ( Fig .
7 C ) .
However , expression of the IL-18Ra @ was markedly downregulated after 1 wk of priming under Th2 conditions ( Fig .
7 , F and I ) .
More impressively , Th2 cells failed to secrete any detectable IFN-y when cultured with IL-12 , IL-18 , or both IL-12 and IL-18 ( Fig .
7 L ) .
Thus , signaling via IL-12 and IL-18 receptors is extinguished even after 1 wk of priming under Th2 conditions .

- Stat6 is required for IL-4-mediated downregulation of IL- 18Ra expression and IL-18-induced IFN-y .
CD4* T cells from wild-type BALB/c ( A-C and G-K ) and Staté~'~ ( D-F and G-K ) mice were stimulated for two d with plate-bound anti-CD3 and IL-2 alone ( A and D ) , or with IL-2 and IL-4 ( B and E ) or IL-12 ( C and F ) .
The cells were then washed and placed into fresh IL-2 media with fresh cytokine for an additional 2 d. Cells were then stained for IL-18Ra expression .
Alternatively , cells from BALB/c or mice were primed for 7 d with anti-CD3 and IL-2 , then restimulated with either anti-CD3 ( G ) , IL-2 ( B ) , IL-12 ( I and K ) , or IL-18 ( J and K ) .
Cells were stained for intracellular IFN-y and IL-4 .
Discussion IL-18 has now been well characterized as a costimulatory factor for IL-12-mediated Th1 differentiation .
IL-18 may mediate its effects directly by augmentation of IFN-y production ( 6 , 10 , 23 , 24 ) or by enhancement of the expression of the IL-12R complex , thereby potentiating the effects of IL-12 ( 25 ) .
While many studies have focused attention on the regulation of the IL-12R during Th cell differentiation , fewer have focused on regulation of the IL-18R ( 24 , 26-29 ) .
It has been widely assumed that the IL-18Ra is expressed only after T cell activation as the IL-18Ra could readily be detected on fully differentiated murine Th1 cells , but not on Th2 cells , either at the mRNA level or at the cell surface ( 22-24 , 26 ) .
We have used a polyclonal antibody prepared against residues 19-346 of the extracellular domain of the IL-18Ra and were readily able to detect IL-18Ra on almost all CD4* and CD8+* T cells .
It is highly likely that our ability to detect the IL-18Ra on naive cells is related to both the specificity of the antibody we have used as well as to our staining protocol .
Although the IL-18Ra was expressed at relatively uniform levels on the majority of CD4¢* T cells , we detected a subpopulation of unstimulated CD4* T cells that expressed ~5-10-fold higher levels of receptor than the majority of the CD4*+* population .
These cells appeared to be activated/ 149 Smeltz et al .

In contrast to the majority of CD4+* IL-18Ra ' '' * cells , the CD4* IL-18Ra '' cells upregulated expression of the IL-18Ra « on culture with IL-12 alone .
It is very likely that the effects of IL-12 alone on IL-18Ra that have been reported by others ( 23 ) are secondary to stimulation of this memory T cell population .
Indeed , in our hands fully differentiated Th1 clones will also upregulate IL-18Ra in response to IL-12 and produce IFN-y in the absence of TCR ligation .
Therefore , it is unlikely that truly naive cells can respond to IL-12 by upregulating the IL-18Rax , especially since these cells do not express the IL-12RB2 subunit which is required for IL-12 signaling .
We have not yet studied the regulation of the IL-18Ra « on CD8+* T cells in response to IL-12 and it also remains possible that the IL-18Ra « x is differentially regulated on CD8+ T cells .
In the studies of Yoshimoto et al .
( 23 ) , no effort was made to separate CD4* cells and CD8* cells .
Short-term culture of T cells in IL-2 alone led to downregulation of IL-18Ra « on the CD4* IL-18Ro'~* population , and this downregulatory effect was further po-tentiated by stimulation via the TCR .
These data are consistent with a previous report showing anti-CD3-triggered downregulation of IL-18Ra expression ( 23 ) and with the observations of Ahn et al .

Regulation of IL-18Ra « expression during Th1/Th2 differentiation .
CD4* T cells from 5CC7 trans- ng/ml IFN-Y 200 300 400 200 300 400 100 100 ND genic mice were primed with irradiated APCs and cytochrome C under Th1 , Th null , or Th2 conditions .
After 1 wk in culture , T cells were rechallenged for 6 h with PMA and ionomycin and then stained for intracellular IFN-y and IL-4 to confirm polarization of T cells into Th1 ( A ) , Th null ( B ) , and Th-2 ( C ) phenotypes .
Alternatively , T cells were rechallenged for 2 d with APCs and antigen , but 2 0 IL~12 _ ] 0 100 200 300 400 W IL-12 7 0 IL~18 IL~18 IL-12 7 IL~12/IL-18 IL~12/IL-18 7 with IL-2 alone also led to downregulation of IL-18Ra expression .
In contrast to the findings of Yoshimoto et al .
( 23 ) , we found that culture of CD4* T cells with the combination of anti-CD3 and IL-12 led to a pronounced increase in IL-18Ra « expression on the CD4* IL-18Ro'~ population .
A possible difference between the results presented here and those of others is that in our 4-d culture system with anti-CD3 and cytokines , T cells were cultured with immobilized anti-CD3 for only the first 2 d to reduce cell death as the result of repeated stimulation via the TCR .
Culture of CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 and IL-18 failed to induce upregulation of the IL-18Ra .
However , IL-18 could synergize with IL-12 to induce IL-18Ra upregulation in the presence of anti-CD3 .
Collectively , these results are most consistent with a model in which IL-12 dictates IL-18 responsiveness in T cells .
Further evidence of this is supported by the observation that the ability of IL-12 to upregulate IL-18Ra expression is abrogated in Stat4~'~ mice ( data not shown ) .
The capacity of IL-12 to induce upregulation of the IL-18Ra was completely IFN-y dependent , as T cells from 150 in the absence of cytokines .
Cells were analyzed for IL-18Ra expression both before ( D-F ) and after ( G-I ) re-challenge .
Also , Th1 ( J ) , Th null ( K ) , or Th2 ( L ) cells were restimulated with the indicated cytokine and levels of IFN-y determined by ELISA .
IL~12/1L-187 IFN-y~ '' ~ mice did not upregulate their IL-18Ra « when stimulated with anti-CD3 and IL-12 .
Although reconstitu-tion of these cultures with IFN-y restored IL-18Ra expression , IFN-y itself did not enhance IL-18Ra expression in the absence of IL-12 .
Thus , IFN-y increases T cell responsiveness to IL-12 mostly likely via its effects on induc-tion/maintenance of expression of the IL-12RB2 chain .
The detection of IL-18Ra on resting CD4* T cells prompted us to examine the factors responsible for the absence of the IL-18Ra on Th2 clones .
We have demonstrated that IL-4 rapidly downregulates the expression of the IL-18Ra during short-term stimulation of naive CD4+* T cells with anti-CD3 .
When CD4* T cells were primed under Th2 conditions , marked downregulation was seen after 1 wk of culture and after 3 wk of culture under Th2 conditions , there was no detectable IL-18Ra expression ( data not shown ) .
There was no observable downregulation of IL-18Ra when resting T cells were cultured with IL-4 ( data not shown ) in the absence of TCR stimulation , suggesting that TCR-mediated signals are also required .
The effect of IL-4 on IL-18Ra expression was even more dra- Regulation of IL-18 Receptor Expression matic when T cells from IL-4~ '' ~ mice were used .
IL-4~ '' ~ T cells expressed higher levels of IL-18Ra after the 4-d culture when compared with wild-type cells ; however , the addition of exogenous IL-4 resulted in downregulation of IL-18Ra to levels similar to wild-type .
This is consistent with the notion that endogenous IL-4 contributes to IL-18Ra downregulation during anti-CD3 stimulation .
Further support for the role of IL-4 in negative regulation of IL-18Ra is that Stat6é~'~ T cells , which are impaired in their ability to respond to IL-4 , also express higher levels of IL-18Ra after T cell activation .
In addition , the ability of IL-12 to upregulate IL-18Rax is enhanced in T cells .
Surprisingly , the addition of TGF-B to either anti-CD3 or antigen-primed cultures led to an increase in IL-18Ra expression .
TGF-B has been shown by others to inhibit IL-4 production ( 31 ) , and we hypothesize that the inhibition of IL-4 production by TGF-B is responsible for the observed increase in IL-18Ra expression .
In addition to examining the cytokine requirements for expression of the IL-18Ra during Th1/Th2 differentiation , we have also examined their effects on the induction of both IL-12 and IL-18 responsiveness .
Restimulation of CD4* T cells that had been cultured for 4 d with anti-CD3 , IL-2 , and the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 , but not either cytokine alone , resulted in production of large amounts of IFN-y .
More importantly , when CD4* T cells were cultured for 4 d with anti-CD3 and IL-12 , they produced significant amounts of IFN-y when restimulated with either IL-12 or IL-18 alone .
Identical results were observed with 1-wk Th1 cells .
The capacity to respond to IL-18 alone correlated with enhanced level of cell surface IL-18Ra expression .
Although CD4* T cells cultured with anti-CD3 and IL-4 for 4 d retained their capacity to respond to the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 , 1-wk Th2 cells were completely nonresponsive .
This is probably due to the absence of endogenous IL-12 and IFN-y in Th2-priming experiments .
Similar results have been reported by others ( 7 , 32 ) .
The ability of IL-4 to regulate IL-18-induced IFN-y production was also evident in T cells from Stat6b~'~ mice , which secreted significantly more IFN-y in response to IL-18/IL-12 plus IL-18 when compared with controls .
This enhanced production of IFN-y correlated with increased levels of IL-18Rax expression .
Although IFN-y production in response to IL-18 appeared to correlate with expression of the IL-18Rax , we can not exclude the possibility that increased expression/induction of IL-18RRB accounted , in part , for enhanced IFN-y production in response to IL-18 .
Very little information is available concerning the regulation of IL-18RB expression ( 20 ) .
Intriguingly , 1-wk Th null cells still responded vigorously to the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 by producing significant amounts of IFN-y .
These in vitro findings raise a number of questions about the possible role of IL-12 and IL-18 in inducing IFN-y production during the course of an inflammatory response in vivo .
As IL-12 and IL-18 may be produced by different cell types under different conditions , one possibility is that T cells primed in an IL-12 rich environment will subsequently be able to respond by pro 151 Smeltz et al .
ducing IFN-y in response to either cytokine alone in the absence of reactivation by their TCR .
Although the in vivo equivalent of our Th null cell population has not been directly demonstrated , immunization of mice with autoan-tigens under certain conditions results in a population of primed T cells that only produce IL-2 and not Th1/Th2 cytokines ( 33-34 ) .
It is possible that when these cells are exposed to IL-12 and IL-18 in a paracrine fashion during the course of an infectious insult they would complete their differentiation into pathogenic Th1 cells .
Apart from the known effects of IL-18 in synergizing with IL-12 to drive Th1 responses , recent reports have shown that IL-18 can induce Th2-type responses ( i.e. , IgE , IL-4 , IL-13 ) ( 12-15 ) .
One interpretation of these studies is that IL-18 is a potent inducer of IL-4 and IL-13 production by basophils and mast cells , or possibly CD4¢* T cells .
Indeed , induction of IL-4 production by IL-18 in NK T cells has recently been reported ( 35 ) , which is consistent with our observation that unstimulated CD4+* NKT cells express high levels of IL-18Ra similar to NK cells ( data not shown ) .
Such a systemic production of IL-4 may facilitate the priming of antigen-specific CD4* Th2 cells .
Our observation that IL-4 leads to downregulation of the IL-18Ra on CD4+* T cells is very compatible with such a model , as the absence of the IL-18Ra on the antigen-responsive T cells would further prevent the potential costimulatory effects of IL-18 on IL-12-mediated Th1 differentiation .
Since this IL-4-mediated downregulation of IL-18Ra was only observed when T cells were triggered through the TCR , bystander effects of IL-4 on resting cells that express the IL-18Ra would not occur .
Ultimately , the major factor that determines whether IL-18 potentiates Th1- or Th2-type immune responses is likely to be the balance between IL-12 and IL-4 in the microenvironment during T cell priming .
The presence of IL-12 , as well as the expression of IL-12 receptor components , would allow IL-18 to synergize with IL-12 in the development of Th1 development .
Conversely , the presence of specialized cell types capable of making IL-4 in response to IL-18 ( i.e .
mast cells ) would favor IL-18 as a potentiator of Th2 responses .
