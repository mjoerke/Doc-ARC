GODARD Clinique des Maladies Respiratories , CJF INSERM 9210 , Hopital Arnaud de Villeneuve , and *INSERM Unité 58 , Montpellier , France ( Accepted for publication 26 October 1995 ) SUMMARY Although their precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated , glucocorticoids represent the most effective therapy in the treatment of asthma .
Interactions between the glucocorticoid receptor and the AP-1 complex have been shown to regulate the transcription of some genes , including glucocorticoid receptor itself .
The aim of the present study was to compare the expression of mRNA for glucocorticoid receptor in human blood monocytes obtained from seven unstable untreated asthmatic patients who were subsequently treated with high doses of parenteral corticosteroid ( methyl prednisolone 120 mg/ day ) for 10 days .
mRNA expression was identified after RNA extraction using RNAzo ! l and analysed after reverse transcriptase , by polymerase chain reaction using a semiquantitative competitive hybridization assay .
All asthmatic patients showed an improvement in their FEV ; values after corticosteroid treatment ( per cent of predicted value 68-28 £493 versus 95-57 + 6-41 , P < 0-02 ) , and a significant decrease for glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression ( P < 0:02 ) was observed in their monocytes .
This is the first report of an ex vivo down-regulation for the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression , following corticosteroid treatment .
Keywords - asthma - glucocorticoid receptor INTRODUCTION Both systemic and inhaled corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of asthma , but their underlying mechanisms of action are still unclear despite important advances in understanding their molecular mechanism of regulation [ 1 ] .
Several studies have shown a decrease of cellular infiltration into asthmatic airways following treatment with glucocorticoids ( GC ) [ 2 ] .
Generally , GC are able to interfere with the in vivo production of inflammatory mediators to suppress the putative in vivo inflammatory response [ 3 ] .
At the molecular level , GC act by their binding to the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .
It has been shown that dexamethasone induced a down-regulation of GR mRNA and GR protein in rat liver or in human cell lines [ 4,5 ] .
To our knowledge there are no published studies investigating the regulation of GR expression ex vivo in asthmatic patients treated by GC .
Bronchial inflammation in asthma is characterized by sub-mucosal cellular infiltration which appears to involve cells of the monocyte lineage [ 6 ] .
There is some evidence that circulating blood monocytes are activated in asthma [ 7 ] .

© 1996 Blackwell Science corticosteroids mRNA - human blood monocytes corticoresistant asthmatic patients have been shown to differ from those of corticosensitive patients [ 8 ] , as shown by their different ability to bind GR to the glucocorticoid responsive element ( GRE ) on DNA [ 9 ] .
On the contrary , recent studies have shown that alteration of the GR binding with GC and GR number was related to lymphocytes rather than to monocytes [ 10 ] .
Blood monocytes appear to be suitable cells in asthma to examine the regulation of GR expression .
The aim of the present study was to analyse the regulation of GR mRNA expression in human blood monocytes from healthy subjects and asthmatic patients before and after methylprednisolone injection ( 120 mg/day ) for 10 days .
Our findings confirm a down-regulation of GR [ 11 ] and extend these observations ex vivo in blood monocytes from asthmatic patients .
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients Seven non-smoking patients suffering from unstable asthma with ages ranging from 28 to 66 years ( 48 +4 years ( mean + s.e.m . ) )
were included in the study ( Table 1 ) .
Asthma was defined according to the American Thoracic Society criteria [ 12 ] .
Asthma instability was defined according to the presence of nocturnal 311 312 Table 1 .

All patients had the same clinical evaluation , including pulmonary function tests , allergy skin prick tests , lung and sinus x-rays .
None of them had been treated by either inhaled or oral GC for the past 3 months .
3 ; -agonists were used as needed by the asthma symptoms .
Six healthy volunteers were also included in this study ; they were age- ( 25-45 years ( 35 +5 years ) ) and sex- ( 3M/3F ) matched .
The study was performed after informed consent , and fulfilled the criteria of the Ethics Committee of the University of Montpellier .
Monocyte preparation Peripheral blood was recovered by venipuncture at 8 am in heparinized tubes ( 25 U/ml ) .
Cells were isolated by centrifugation of blood samples overlayered onto isotonic Percoll ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) solutions as previously described [ 14 ] .
Briefly , the mononuclear cell suspension was removed , washed , and contaminating erythrocytes were lysed .
After washing , monocytes were counted in the initial cell suspension using neutral red stain which allows easy identification of blood monocytes [ 15 ] ( neutral red/monocyte suspension : 3/1 ) .
Neutral red positive cells ( 5 x 10° per Petri dish ) were then incubated with 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 20 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Greco Chemical , Paisley , UK ) for 2 h at 37°C in a humid atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % CO , .
The monolayer was then washed to remove non-aderent cells .
Monocytes were then frozen directly at -80°C to protect them from RNAse attack until use .
The purity of monocytes was > 95 % as assessed by May-Griinwald staining .
Isolation and analysis of total RNA Total cellular RNA was obtained by lysing cells directly on the monolayer in RNAzol ( Bioprobe System , Montreuil , France ) following the manufacturer 's protocol according to a method derived from Chomcynski & Sacci [ 16 ] .
Briefly , the extracted RNA in the aqueous phase was obtained after homogenization of the cells in the reaction mixture containing RNAzol and chloroform ( Prolabo , Paris , France ) and after centrifugation at 12 000g for 15min at 4°C .
The RNA solution extract was allowed to precipitate with 1 v isopropanol at 4°C for 15 min and centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at 4°C to form a pellet .
The pellet of RNA was washed with 70 % ethanol solution and vacuum dried briefly , and was then solubilized in 30 pl H , O and stored at -80°C until subsequent analysis .
The quantity of RNA was calculated by OD 260 spectrophotometry .
The integrity of the purified RNA was determined by visualization of the 288 and 188 ribosomal RNA bands after electrophor-esis of 1-2 ug of each RNA sample through a 1 % agaroseformaldehyde gel .
Reverse-transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction Total RNA samples of 02-04 pug were subjected to reverse transcription ( RT ) with oligo dT used as a template primer .
First-strand synthesis was carried out for 1h at 37°C in 25 pul of a reaction mixture using 200 U Moloney Murine Leukaemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase ( M-MLV RT ; Gisco BRL ) in 1 x RT buffer , 05 mm dATP , dGTP , dCTP , dTTP , 10 mm DTT , 20 U of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor ( Promega France , Lyon , France ) and 0-25 ug of oligo dT ( Biolabs , Gaitherburg , MD ) [ 17,18 ] .
The reaction mixture was heated to 98°C for 5 min to inactivate RT .
Primers for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) were prepared for both genes : glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; 171 bp ) , GR ( 201 bp ) .
Much attention had been given to their locus on the gene to be used in the RT-PCR , and the sequence of PCR primer is as follows : GR sense 5 '' CAA AAG AGC AGT GGA AGG ACA 3 , GR antisense 5° GAG GTT TCT TGT GAG ACT CCT GT 3 ' ; GAPDH sense 5 '' TCG CCA GCC GAG CCA CAT 3 ' , GAPDH antisense 5° GGA ACA TGT AAA CCA TGT AGT TG 3 ' .
Absence of contaminants was checked by RT-PCR assays of control samples with no RNA , no RT or PCR reaction buffer only .
PCR assays contained 0:5 U Taq DNA polymerase , 0-5 um of each oligonucleotide primer , 0-2 m dNTP , 0-25 or 2+5 pl of the RT reaction mixture , 50 mm KCI , 10 mm , Tris-HCl pH9 , 0:1 % Triton X-100 , 5-15 % glycerol , 1:5 mm magnesium chloride in a final volume of 50 ul .
An amplification sequence of 28 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min , annealing at 53°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 2 min was used .
Both sets of RT reaction mixture were analysed to check that PCR products were obtained during the exponential phase , as previously described by Roux et al .
[ 19 ] .
Reproducibility of this experiment was performed using U937 and W126 cell lines for GR mRNA expression .
The variation found for six different experiments was less than 4 % for the same amounts of mRNA .
PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis in TAE buffer with ethidium bromide-stained ( 0:5 mm ) 2 % agarose gel ( Fig .
1 ) .
Analysis of cDNA using competitive bioluminescence assays PCR products were quantified using the method of unlabelled amplified sequence of Térouanne ef al .

Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) products ( 8 pl ) analysis on a 2 % agarose gel for mRNA levels of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) for healthy subject ( lane 1 ) , asthmatic patients before treatment ( lanes 2 and 4 ) , and asthmatic patients after treatment ( lanes 3 and 5 ) .
Electrophoresis was run in TAE buffer with ethidium bromide .
FITC-oligonucleotide primers were used as DNA probes in known concentrations .
These probes were denatured and hybridized in solution in the presence of the DNA sequences to be studied ( PCR products ) .
The remaining reformed double-labelled hybrid was bound to a bioluminescent immunosorbent substrate and detected by a rapid bioluminescent assay using streptavadin-G6PDH con-jugate .
The quantity of probe regenerated after denaturation and hybridization decreased with increasing amounts of PCR products .
Briefly , PCR products were diluted in 1 x Taq buffer , 5 % glycerol and incubated with 20 fm of the homologous labelled sequence in 100 ul of competitive buffer ( 0-01 m Tris-HCl pH9 , 0:5m NaCl , 10 pg/ml denatured sonicated salmon sperm , 05 % gelatin ) .
The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 99°C , cooled rapidly to 60°C and incubated for 2 h at this temperature .
Samples were centrifuged and 50 ul of the mixture were added to lumin-ometer vials with 50 pul of streptavidin-GGPDH and 50 ul of bioluminescent adsorbent .
Quantification was performed for each experiment for GR and GAPDH PCR products and the ratio GR/GAPDH was calculated .
Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests .
The Wilcoxon W-test was used for paired data comparing asthmatic patients before and after treatment .
RESULTS Patients Table 1 presents individual characteristics of the patients .
All patients were in an unstable state of asthma , and their Aas score ranged from 2 to 4 .
The FEV ; values ranged from 47 % to 88 % of their predicted values before treatment .
These values significantly increased in all asthmatic patients included in our study after CG treatment ( 68-28 + 4-93 % ( mean +s.e.m . )
before GC treatment versus 95-57 + 640 % after ; P < 0-02 , Wilcoxon W-test ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
The improvement of FEV ; was ranged from 500 to 950 ml after GC .
Monocyte recovery The number of monocytes , obtained before adherence , was not different between asthmatic patients and healthy subjects ( 1-71 x 10° cells/ml for asthmatics patients versus 208 x 10° cells/ml for healthy subjects ) .
In asthmatic patients , the total number of monocytes did not change after the treatment period ( 171 versus 2:24 x 10° cells/ml ) .
mRNA expression The amounts of GR mRNA in six healthy subjects and seven asthmatic patients before treatment with GC were respectively 4:67 + 1-50 versus 6-38 + 1:4 , without significant difference .
The individual ratios GR/GAPDH mRNA for monocytes of asthmatic patients presented in Fig .
2 show significantly decreased levels of GR mRNA expression in monocytes for all patients after 10 days treatment by GC ( P < 0-02 ) .
However , there was no significant correlation with the change in FEV ) .
DISCUSSION Treatment by systemic corticosteroids induced a decrease of GR mRNA expression .
Asthmatic patients with variable severity of disease who presented an exacerbation and an airflow obstruction were invited to participate in this study .
All required general treatment with GC at home , and we chose methylprednisolone 120 mg/day intravenously , to obtain the best overall compliance , and to achieve the best clinical and functional results at the end of the treatment period .
All patients displayed an improvement in airway obstruction , reaching an absolute increase of 190 ml for the FEV ; values .
This value has been previously described as the minimal value defining reversibility [ 22 ] .
By this criterion , all patients were corticosteroid-sensitive according to Carmichael 's definition [ 23 ] .
The low amounts of mRNA obtained after extraction compelled us to amplify the products of transcription using a quantitative PCR method [ 24 ] .
This method was established and validated by Térouanne et al .

( b ) Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) mRNA level expressed as the ratio GR/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) obtained in human blood monocytes from asthmatic patients before and after treatment .
Statistical analysis shows significant differences using Wilcoxon W-test .
Before of a homologous probe ( double-labelled with biotin and fluores-cein ) .
GAPDH expression was always the same in all subjects and was used as our internal control to express results as a ratio .
DNA sequences were obtained by RT-PCR after total RNA extraction using RNAzol kit extract .
No difference in the expression of GR mRNA was observed between healthy and asthmatic subjects .
This result shows that circulating inflammatory mediators which are increased in asthma did not modulate the expression of GR mRNA .
Based upon these results , there are no data to support an abnormal expression of GR mRNA related to asthma status .
GC are the most effective therapy available for controlling asthma , and their effects have been demonstrated at several levels .
Dexamethasone decreases GR mRNA levels by decreasing receptor gene transcription with an homologous regulation [ 25 ] , and other heterologous regulation can also be observed .
A marked reduction in GR mRNA was described in human lung tissue after exposure to steroids in vitro [ 26 ] .
A decrease of protein and mRNA expression was described in vivo in rat liver after an exposure to GC [ 4,27 ] .
All these studies show that GR and its ability to bind GRE may be important factors which influence the efficacy of the various sensitivities of GC treatments .
The down-regulation of GR is unlikely to be due to a decrease in mRNA half-life , but the GC regulate GR mRNA levels by influencing gene transcription [ 28 ] .
This study shows , for the first time , that this down-regulation can be observed ex vivo on human blood monocytes after exposure to GC for 10 days .
It was not possible to perform this ex vivo study in control subjects for ethical reasons , but according to the previous results using cell lines and in vivo studies in rat liver , GR mRNA expression may also be down-regulated in non-asthmatic patients .
The regulation of hormone receptors is an important aspect of physiologic control , since the sensitivity of cells to this hormone is directly related to receptor concentration , though the role of this physiological regulation is still unclear .
In fact the down-regulation of GR MRNA does not reflect a lower sensitivity of the GC via reduced GR function [ 29 ] .
This down-regulation may be a protective process for the cells , since GR may have deleterious effects by increasing GR mRNA expression with positive autoregulation .
Therefore , down-regulation might occur without any difference in the total protein level of GR , but rather via a decrease in the de novo turn-over of the protein .
This study demonstrates down-regulation of GR mRNA expression ex vivo in asthmatic patients treated with GC .
