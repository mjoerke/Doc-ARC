REVIEW Cell Research ( 2000 ) , 10 , 245-266 Inducible resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in B cells RotHstEm THomas L Departments of Medicine and Microbiology , and the Evans Memorial Department of Clinical Research , Boston University Medical Center , Boston , MA , USA ABSTRACT Apoptosis produced in B cells through Fas ( APO-1 , CD95 ) triggering is regulated by signals derived from other surface receptors : CD40 engagement produces upregulation of Fas expression and marked susceptibility to Fas-induced cell death , whereas antigen receptor engagement , or IL-4R engagement , inhibits Fas killing and in so doing induces a state of Fas-resistance , even in otherwise sensitive , CD40-stimulated targets .
Surface immunoglobulin and IL-4R utilize at least partially distinct pathways to produce Fas-resistance that differentially depend on PKC and STAT6 , respectively .
Further , surface immunoglobulin signaling for inducible Fas-resistance bypasses Btk , requires NF- Â« B , and entails new macromolecular synthesis .
Terminal effectors of B cell Fasg-resistance include the known anti-apoptotic gene products , Bel-xL and FLIP , and a novel anti-apoptotic gene that encodes FAIM ( Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule ) .

The FAIM sequence is highly evo-lutionarily conserved , suggesting an important role for this molecule throughout phylogeny .
Inducible resistance to Fas killing is hypothesized to protect foreign antigen-specific B cells during potentially hazardous interactions with FasL-bearing T cells , whereas autoreactive B cells fail to become Fas-resistant and are deleted via Fas-dependent cytotoxicity .
Inadvertent or aberrant acquisition of Fas-resistance may permit autoreactive B cells to escape Fas deletion , and malignant lymphocytes to impede anti-tumor immunity .

INRODUCTION Fas/APO-1 ( CD95 ) is a death receptor of the TNF receptor ( TNFR ) family , and shares with death receptors TNFR1 , DR3 ( TRAMP , Wsl , APO-3 ) , DR4 ( TRAIL-R1 ) and DR5 ( TRAIL-R2 ) extracellular cysteine-rich pseudorepeats , intracellular C-terminal death domains , and reliance on FADD as a critical early mediator of signaling for cell death ( although FADD-dependence has been questioned for DR4 ) [ 1-7 ] .
The cognate ligand for Fas ( FasL ) is an activation antigen expressed by CD4+ Th1 effector cells and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes , ( although its activity in the latter is frequently masked by the more substantial destructive power of the perforin-granzyme system ) , as well as natural killer cells [ 8-13 ] .
The congenital loss of Fas ( as in lpr/lpr mice and Fas null mice , and in human Autoimmune Lymphoproliferation Syndrome ) or of its ligand ( as in gld/gld mice ) is accompanied by severely elevated levels of serum autoantibodies associated with frank autoimmunity [ 14-24 ] ; for this reason Fas is thought to play a key role in the regulation of B cells , particularly in the regulation of autoreactive B cells .
These observations are supported and refined by additional experiments , carried out over the last dozen years , that more clearly document abnormal B cell function in Fas-deficient animals and distinguish B cell defects from abnormalities in the T cell population .
Thus , in both mixed radiation chimeras and tetraparental chimeras , autoimmune immunoglobulin was derived solely from lpr B cells and not from co-existing phenotypically normal B cells that were simultaneously exposed to abnormal lpr T cells [ 25-27 ] .
Moreover , autoantibody production was present and undiminished when Fas deficiency was restricted to B cells through production of transgenic MRL - lpr mice 246 Rothstein TL that express Fas within the thymocyte and peripheral T cell populations by use of the murine Ick promoter , in comparison to unmanipulated MRL mice [ 28 ] .
These results indicate that a block in the Fas death pathway leads to dysregulation of B cells that express self-recognizing specificities , suggesting that under normal circumstance Fas functions to delete such autoreactive B cells .
In lpr and Fas null B cells , Fas-induced cell death is blocked congenitally by loss of surface Fas expression .
However , this is a somewhat artificial , certainly non-physiological , way of thwarting Fas killing .
In view of the very severe immune dyscrasias attendant to genetic interference with Fas signaling for cell death , the question arose as to whether Fas-mediated cell death is ever blocked during normal immune cell activity , because if that would happen , it might contribute to autoimmune B cell activity .
More generally , it was unclear to what extent the outcome of Fas signaling is modulated by other influences , particularly receptor-specific ones .
Although it was known that B cell activation , as with lipopolysaccharide , was associated with Fas expression and sensitivity to Fas signaling for cell death that greatly exceed the low levels present in naive B cells [ 29-33 ] , we pursued this issue further , by evaluating the effect of triggering certain surface receptors in primary B cells .
Early on it was found that B cell stimulation through CD40 for 1-3 d markedly upregulated both surface Fas expression , and sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis .
In direct contrast , B cell stimulation through surface immunoglobulin ( slg ) failed to enhance susceptibility to Fas killing at all .
Thus , these two mitogenic receptor- mediated signals differ markedly in their capacity to increase the sensitivity of B cell targets to Fas-mediated apoptosis [ 34 ] .
We then evaluated whether the failure of slg engagement to induce Fas-sensitivity resulted from a passive process , due to inadequate signaling for this outcome , or a dominant process , due to active suppression of cytotoxicity .
To address this issue , primary B cells were stimulated with CD4O0L in combination with , or sequentially with , anti-Ig , and then examined for susceptibility to apoptosis in the form of FasL-depen-dent Th1-cell mediated cytotoxicity ( Th1-CMC ) .
B cells stimulated by CD4OL plus anti-Ig expressed increased levels of surface Fas comparable in magnitude to the elevated levels present in B cells stimulated by CD40L alone ; however , the susceptibility of dual-stimulated B cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis was much reduced in comparison to B cells stimulated only by CD40L [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
Whereas the percent specific lysis produced during a 4 h `` Cr release assay of B cells stimulated by CD4O0L alone typically ranged from 40-60 % at the highest Th1 effector : B cell target ratio tested ( 9:1 ) , the corresponding percent specific lysis for B cells stimulated by both CD4OL and anti-Ig was only 0-15 % .
Considering a large number of experiments , the mean level of protection against Fas killing produced by slg signaling amounted to more than 20-fold , meaning that a greater than 20-fold higher Th1 effector : B cell target ratio was needed to produce comparable levels of apoptosis in B cells stimulated by the combination of CD4O0L plus anti-Ig as in B cells stimulated by CD4O0L alone [ 35 ] .
Thus , anti-Ig-induced sIg crosslinking established a state of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis , or Fas-resistance .
Moreover , slg 247 Inducible Fas-resistance in B cells engagement by specific antigen similarly produced Fas-resistance , in experiments in which B cells were obtained from transgenic animals expressing either B cell receptors that recognize H-2K** , or B cell receptors that recognize HEL , demonstrating that sIg-induced Fas-resistance is a physiologic process and is not dependent on the use of crosslinking anti-Ig antibody [ 34 ] , [ 86 ] .
The opposing effects of CD40 and slg engagement on Fas signaling for cell death raised the question of whether engagement of other surface receptors might similarly alter susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis .
To address this issue , various ligands were tested in conjunction with CD4O0L stimulation prior to evaluating sensitivity to Th1 cell-mediated cytotoxicity .
Through this effort IL-4 , alone among the cytokines examined , was found to produce Fas-resistance [ 37 ] .
As with anti-Ig , IL-4 produced Fas-resistance when added either concurrently , or sequentially , with CD4O0L , and did so without any change in the elevated level of Fas expression produced by CD40 signaling ; however , IL-4 in optimal doses was less effective than anti-Ig , providing a level of protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis that averaged about 10-fold [ 37 ] .
These results with anti-Ig and IL-4 indicate that in normal B cells , Fas-mediated apoptosis can be suppressed through inducible receptor-triggered mechanisms completely distinct from genetic alteration of Fas .
This paradigm is supported by subsequent reports of in vitro experiments in the human system , and of in vivo experiments in the murine system [ 38-41 ] .
Thus , the outcome of B cell stimulation with respect to Fas signaling is regulated on the basis of particular environmental cues as interpreted by specific receptor binding .
In the experiments described above , Fas-mediated apoptosis was initiated by Th1 cell membrane-bound FasL , and Fas-resistance was observed in B cells stimulated by CD40L plus anti-Ig , or by CD4O0L plus IL-4 .
Similar results were obtained with recombinant , soluble FasL [ 35 ] .
Surprisingly though , a different outcome appeared when Fas killing was triggered by soluble Jo-2 monoclonal anti-Fas antibody , in which case the level of protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis was much reduced in comparison to that which was apparent with Th1 effector cells , to the point that Fas-resistance was not always evident .
The failure to observe Fas-resistance in antibody-treated B cells suggests that Jo-2 produces a super-physiological stimulus that overwhelms receptor-driven Fas-resistance .
The reason for this might be that B cell FcR crosslinking of whole anti-Fas antibody produces more efficient Fas engagement , inasmuch as Jo-2-induced Fas killing was blocked by 2.4G2 anti-FcR antibody , or it might be that the anti-Fas antibody binds an epitope distinct from that engaged by FasL , inasmuch as soluble FasL did not block the ability of Jo-2 to produce apoptosis in Fas-resistant B cells treated with CD4O0L plus anti-Ig [ 35 ] ( and unpublished results ) .
Regardless of the mechanism , however , the results with Jo-2 indicate that sIg- and IL-4R-induced protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis is relative rather than absolute , and can be overcome by especially strong apoptotic signals derived from Fas , including those produced by particularly high Th1 effector cell : B cell target cell ratios .
248 Rothstein TL Receptor signaling for Fas-resistance Although the outcomes of engaging sIg and IL-4R in terms of inducible resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis are similar , the pathways utilized to bring this about differ , as evidenced by the reliance of Fas-resistance induction on specific signaling mediators .
Thus , inhibition of PKC by cell-permeant H7 , or depletion of PKC by prolonged exposure to PMA , blocked induction of Fas-resistance by anti-Ig but had no effect on IL-4R-induced Fas-resistance [ 35 ] .
Conversely , the loss of STATS ( in B cells obtained from STAT6-deficient mice ) blocked induction of Fasg-resistance by IL-4 but had no effect on slg-induced Fas-resistance [ 42 ] .
( Of interest , sIg engagement was recently shown to trigger STATE activation [ 43 ] , which raised the possibility that STAT6 might form the basis of a common pathway leading both from slg and from IL-4R to inducible Fas-resistance ; however , the results discussed above negate this possibility ) .
Further , the relative speed with which Fas-resistance was established also differed for anti-Ig and IL-4 .
Whereas anti-Ig acted rapidly to produce Fas-resistance that was apparent at 3 h , and maximal after 12 h , IL-4-induced Fas-resistance developed much more slowly and only reached a maximum after 24 h of exposure [ 35 ] , [ 87 ] .
These results taken together indicate that sIg and IL-4 receptors utilize at least partially non-overlapping intracellular signaling pathways to bring about Fas-resistance .
The timecourse experiments were carried out by stimulating B cells with CD4O0L for a total of 48 h , and adding anti-Ig or IL-4 at various times before the end of the culture period .
Because B cell treatment with CD40L for 24 h was sufficient to induce Fas-sensitivity , the capacity of anti-Ig and IL-4 to produce maximal Fas-resistance when added 24 h before the end of 48 h culture periods with CD40L means that these reagents do not simply prevent the development of Fas-sensitivity in response to CD40 engagement but actually reverse susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis that has already been established .
Additional work on metabolic pathways has focused on sIg-induced Fas-resistance .
In view of the PKC requirement for Fasg-resistance produced by anti-Ig , the capacity of PKC-activating phorbol ester treatment to induce Fas-resistance was examined .
Phorbol ester produced only partial protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis , whereas the combination of a phorbol ester plus a calcium ionophore brought about virtually complete Fas-resistance , the level of which was as high or higher than that associated with anti-Ig [ 35 ] .
This recapitulates results with cell cycle progression as an endpoint , for which only the combination of a phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore , which together mimic the effects of slg-triggered PLC-mediated second messengers , produces S phase entry [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
Thus , Fas-resistance can be established in the absence of specific receptor engagement by appropriate stimulation of intracellular mediators .
Btk is an indispensable intermediary in the slg pathway leading to cell cycle progression , as evidenced by the complete failure of S phase entry in B cells from xid mice , in which Btk is mutated , or in B cells from Btk knock-out mice , in which Btk is absent 249 Inducible Fas-resistance in B cells [ 46-48 ] .
In view of the importance of Btk for slg-induced proliferation , the role of Btk in slg signaling for Fas-resistance was examined using B cells from both kinds of mice .
With xid B cells , the levels of Fas-sensitivity produced by CD4O0L stimulation , and of Fas-resistance induced by anti-Ig , were indistinguishable from results obtained with wild-type control B cells .
With Btk knock-out B cells , CD4O0L stimulation produced Fas-sensitivity that was minimally increased ( by 20-30 % ) over that observed with control B cells ; however , there was no difference between B cells obtained from Btk knock-out and from wild-type control mice in the degree of Fas-resistance produced by anti-Ig [ 49 ] .
The unexpected minor increase in Fas-sensitivity in Btk knock-out B cells may relate to the report that Btk binds Fas and interferes with Fas signaling for cell death , although the modulation of Fas-sensitivity observed here in murine B cells was much less impressive than that reported for chicken DT4O B cells [ 50 ] .
The xid and Btk knock-out results together indicate that Btk plays no role in slg signaling for Fas-resistance .
Thus , the signaling pathway that leads from sIg to Fas-resistance differs completely from the route leading from slg to S phase entry , in that Btk is absolutely required for the latter but not at all for the former .
The finding that Fas-resistance develops over a period of hours following anti-Ig treatment suggested that new gene expression might play a key role .
To examine this possibility , B cells were treated with inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis along with anti-Ig during the last 6 h of 48 h cultures with CD4O0L ( longer periods of exposure being precluded by drug toxicity ) ; the addition of either cycloheximide or actinomycin D completely blocked the induction of Fas-resistance by anti-Ig [ 35 ] , [ 51 ] .
Thus , Fas-resistance induced by slg engagement appears to depend on new gene expression and new protein synthesis .
These results also indicate that the mechanism responsible for sIg-induced Fas-resistance in primary B cells differs from that reported for the A20 B cell line , which is not interrupted by cycloheximide [ 52 ] .
The dependence of slg-induced Fas-resistance on new gene expression implies , in turn , a role for factors that transcriptionally activate anti-apoptotic genes .
A candidate factor might be NF- Â« xB , a transactivating complex that is developmentally regulated and is induced as a result of slg engagement , inasmuch as NF- Â« B has been reported to regulate the expression of some anti-apoptotic genes , and to influence the Fas-sensitivity of T cell lines [ 53-61 ] .
To evaluate the role of NF-cB , inhibitors of nuclear NF-cB translocation were added along with anti-Ig during the last 12 h of 48 h cultures with CD40L ; the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] and the antioxidant pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) [ 64 ] each completely blocked sIg-induced Fas-resistance , while having no effect on the ability of CD4O0L alone to upregulate Fas expression and to produce Fas-sengitivity .
As an important corollary , lactacystin and PDTC also inhibited the activation of NF- Â« xB that was produced when anti-Ig was added to CD40L-stimulated B cells .
These results with two different inhibitors , operating through two different mechanisms of action , indicate that slg signaling for Fag-resis-tance requires NF- Â« B activation and is thus NF- Â« < B-dependent .
Notably , PMA induces 250 Rothstein TL vigorous nuclear translocation of NF- Â« B in mature B cells but only partial resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis [ 35 ] , [ 53 ] , suggesting that either NF- Â« B induction is a necessary but not sufficient condition for Fas-resistance , or that Fas-resistance depends on the induction of sIg-specific Â« < B-binding complexes .
Recently , two groups reported that sIg-induced NF- Â« B activation , like sIg-induced proliferation , is Btk-dependent [ 65 ] , [ 66 ] .
In contrast , the experiments discussed above indicate that sIg-induced Fas-resistance requires NF- Â« B yet takes place in the absence of Btk .
The reason for these seemingly conflicting results remains unclear .
It may be that prior CD40L stimulation establishes a new intracellular signaling pathway through which slg activates NF- Â« B in the absence of Btk .
Or it may be that induction of Fas-resistance requires only a very minimal threshold level of NF- Â« B .
Alternatively , inhibitors of NF- < B activation may at the same time inhibit another signaling mediator , and this latter mediator , not NF- Â« B , is the important molecular effector .
These possibilities are currently being tested .
Two terminal effectors of Fas-resistance : Bel-xi and FLIP The identity of gene products whose synthesis might be responsible for inducible Fas-resistance was sought by testing likely prospects according to two criteria : upregulation of expression under conditions that produce Fas-resistance , and , induction of Fas-resistance by upregulated expression in the absence of receptor engagement .
Initial experiments designed to detect such molecules focused on members of the Bel-2 family , some members of which interfere with mitochondrial cytochrome c release [ 67 ] .
A number of Bel-2- homologous genes were assayed for induction by anti-Ig treatment of CD4O0L-stimulated B cells through RT-PCR .
Only bel-x1 was upregulated .
Bel-x1 expression was strongly induced at the RNA level within an hour of anti-Ig addition , and at the protein level within 6-12 h [ 68 ] .
B cells obtained from Bel-xr-overexpressing transgenic mice were then tested for susceptibility to Thl1 cell mediated cytotoxicity after stimulation by CD40L alone , in order to determine the capacity of Bel-x1 , overexpressed in isolation , to produce Fas-resistance .
These B cells were ( 3-fold ) less sensitive to Fas killing than wild-type littermate control B cells , despite similar levels of upregulated Fas expression , and similar levels of activation as judged by thymidine incorporation [ 68 ] .
Thus , Bel-x1 appears to account for at least a portion of slg-induced Fas-resistance because , expression was upregulated coordinately with induction of Fas-resistance ( in both murine and human B cells , reference [ 69 ] ) , and , because isolated overexpression diminished B cell susceptibility to Fas killing separate and apart from any other potential effects of slg engagement ( although in connection with this last point it should be mentioned that the capacity of Bel-xi to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in B cell lines has been questioned , reference [ 70 ] ) .
Further , the reduction in susceptibility to Th1-induced cytotoxicity produced by Bel-xi suggests that Fas death signaling in B cells involves mitochondrial cytochrome c release ; this notion is supported by our observation that inducibly Fas-resistant B cells are protected against apoptosis produced by C2-ceramide , 251 Inducible Fas-resistance in B cells the cytotoxicity of which has been associated with mitochondrial damage [ 71-75 ] [ 71-75 ] .
There are , however , several indications that Bel-xi does not fully account for Fas-resistance produced by anti-Ig : 1 ) the loss of Fas-sensitivity in ( CD4OL-stimulated ) Bel-xi-overexpressing B cells was incomplete , and was less dramatic than the loss of Fas-sensitivity observed in wild-type B cells stimulated by anti-Ig plus CD40L ; 2 ) anti-Ig treatment of ( CD4O0L-stimulated ) Bel-xr-overexpressing B cells produced a further ( approximately 3-fold ) reduction in the already muted Fas-sensitivity of these B cells ; and , 3 ) Bel-xi1 . }
protein did not appear in normal CD40L-stimulated B cells treated with anti-Ig until after the initial onset of diminished sensitivity to Fas .
These considerations strongly suggest that at least one other anti-Ig-responsive molecule plays a role in blocking Fas killing following slg engagement .
Additional experiments designed to elucidate the identity of gene products potentially responsible for sIg-induced Fas-resistance focused on evaluation of FLIP .
FLIP is a FLICE/caspase 8 homolog that lacks an active enzyme site and thus competitively inhibits downstream signaling that normally occurs following FLICE/caspase 8 binding to FADD [ 76-79 ] .
Our early Northern blot experiments suggested that some FLIP expression was induced by anti-Ig treatment of CD40L-stimulated B cells , but the data were inconclusive owing to the very low level of FLIP expression detected .
However , definitive results were subsequently obtained by RT-PCR , which showed that FLIP RNA expression was induced within an hour of adding anti-Ig to CD40L-stimulated B cells , and that FLIP protein expression was upregulated within 6 h. These results were recently extended by reports indicating that FLIP overexpression interferes with Fas-mediated apoptosis in primary B cells and in B cell lines [ 80 ] , [ 81 ] .
These studies together strongly suggest that FLIP is involved in bringing about sIg-induced resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis because the two criteria discussed above were met , as described earlier for Bel-x1 : FLIP expression was upregulated coordinately with induction of Fas-resistance by anti-Ig , and isolated FLIP overexpression diminished B cell susceptibility to Fas signaling for cell death .
( In these studies a number of other known anti-apoptotic genes screened as outlined above failed to meet the criterion of expression coincident with induction of Fas-resistance , including A1 , A20 , BAG-1 , Bel-2 , IAP-1 , IAP-2 , Ich-18 , IEX-1L and survivin , references [ 82-90 ] .
Identification of a novel Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule ( FAIM ) To identify additional genes that might be responsible for resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis without regard to conserved motifs or known properties , transcripts induced as a result of anti-lg treatment that produces Fas-resistance were detected using a differential display strategy [ 91 ] .
Through this approach , a completely novel 1.2 kb sequence was cloned that contains an open reading frame encoding a protein product of 179 amino acids predicted to reflect a stable , soluble , B-strand-rich molecule that is slightly acidic [ 51 ] .
The function of this gene was evaluated with BAL-17 murine B lymphoma cells , the activation responses of which mimic those of primary B cells in a 252 Rothstein TL number of ways [ 92 ] , including upregulated Fas expression and increased sensitivity to Fas killing following CD40L stimulation .
BAL-17 B cells were transfected with the gene cloned in pBKCMV , or with empty vector , selected in G418 , and then stimulated with CD40L for 24 h and examined for susceptibility to Th1 cell-mediated cytotoxicity .
Cytotoxicity was assessed in two ways , by chromium release after exposure of transfectants to FasL-bearing Th1 effector cells , and by propidium iodide-staining for subdiploid DNA after treatment of transfectants with Jo-2 anti-Fas antibody .
Regardless of the means by which Fas was engaged or cytotoxicity was assessed , Fas-mediated apoptosis was markedly reduced in B cells expressing the gene of interest as compared to vector transfectants , using both G418-resistant pools and stably transfected lines cloned by limiting dilution [ 51 ] .
Considering the dose-response curve with Th1 effector cells , Fas-resistance produced by the gene of interest amounted to a greater than 9-fold level of protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis .
These results indicate that the differentially expressed gene encodes a Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule , which we termed FAIM .
The anti-apoptotic function of FAIM was demonstrated further at a biochemical level by evaluating cleavage products of poly-ADP ribose polymerase ( PARP ) that result from caspase activation [ 93 , 94 ] .
PARP fragments were detected within 40 minutes of treating vector-transfected BAL-17 B cells with Jo-2 anti-Fas antibody , whereas such fragments were not observed in faim-transfected BAL-17 B cells up to 60 minutes after antibody treatment [ 51 ] .
This correlated well with the transgenically enhanced level of FAIM expression , which was demonstrated by Western blotting to be greatly increased over the endogenous levels present in vector-transfected controls .
These results indicate that FAIM blocks Fas killing by interfering with a step prior to terminal caspase activity .
As might be expected from the original selection conditions for differential display analysis , faim mRNA increased within an hour of adding anti-Ig to CD4O0L-stimulated B cells , and expression continued to rise over the next 5 h , as shown by Northern blotting .
Along the same lines , FAIM protein increased within 6 h of treating CD4O0L-stimulated B cells with anti-Ig , and expression continued to rise , peaking at 12 h , as detected by Western blotting [ 51 ] .
The finding of substantially increased FAIM expression in splenocytes obtained from sheep red blood cell-immune animals , as compared to splenocytes obtained from control animals injected with saline , suggests that these in vitro studies of inducible FAIM expression bear relevance for physiological immune responses .
Thus , upregulation of FAIM expression coincides with B cell treatment by Fas-resistance-inducing regimens in vitro , and with induction of foreign antigen-specific immune responses in vivo .
The murine faim sequence contains no known effector domains ; that is , it lacks kinase or phosphatase domains , caspase or CARD domains , PH or SH2 domains , and so forth .
However , we readily identified highly homologous faim sequences in other species , indicating strong evolutionary conservation [ 51 ] .
Human faim was obtained by constructing a consensus sequence from overlapping expressed sequence tag ( EST ) 253 Inducible Fas-resistance in B cells fragments that share some homology with mouse faim , plus direct sequencing of a single EST clone that completely spans the putative human transcript [ 95 ] .
The predicted amino acid sequence of human FAIM is 90 % identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of mouse FAIM .
These results were extended by Southern analysis showing hybridization by a mouse faim probe to genomic DNA from all mammalian species tested ( human , monkey , rat , mouse , dog , cow , and rabbit ) ( unpublished observations ) .
Worm faim was identified by directly sequencing cDNA amplified by PCR , using primers based on our own manual analysis of the putative exonic structure of a C. elegans genomic sequence of unknown function that contains discrete regions of homology with mouse faim .
The predicted amino acid sequence of C. elegans FAIM is 50 % identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of mouse FAIM .
Fly faim was obtained by computer-aided searching of the recently posted D. melanogaster genome , using accepted algorithms to define putative exon/intron structure .
The putative predicted amino acid sequence of D. melanogaster FAIM is 36 % identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of mouse FAIM , with the caveat that the fly sequence has not been amplified directly from cDNA [ 96 ] .
Examination of the predicted FAIM sequences from these 4 species indicates that specific regions of very high identity exist within the amino terminal region that likely represent novel anti-apoptotic effector domains or domains required for FAIM association with another mediator or modulator protein .
Two distinct short stretches of 12 and 13 amino acids each are 69-75 % identical across all four species [ 96 ] .
The evolutionary conservation of faim strongly suggests that the faim gene product is an important regulatory molecule that has been favored for retention throughout phylogeny , and thus likely plays a key role in cellular viability or other processes .
( Since there is no known Fas homolog in C. elegans or D. melanogaster , it is presumed that FAIM carries out a similar , but possibly not Fas-specific , anti-apoptotic function in the worm and the fly . )
Two other characteristics of FAIM suggest that it plays an important role in regulating cellular processes .
1 ) The faim gene is broadly expressed .
High level faim gene expression was documented in murine brain , thymus , kidney and spleen by Northern blotting , and in additional normal tissues by RT-PCR [ 51 ] , [ 96 ] , suggesting that FAIM performs an essential function in non-lymphoid , as well as in lymphoid , cells .
2 ) The faim gene localizes to a cytogenetic region associated with disease .
Human faim was localized to chromosome 3422-25 by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , and to chromosome 3q25 by radiation hybrid analysis of a faim-containing EST [ 96 ] .
This region contains loci associated with B cell lymphoma , acute non-lymphocytic leukemia , and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [ 97-99 ] .
The mechanism by which mutation of a gene that blocks Th1 cell-mediated cytotoxicity might inure to the benefit of malignant cells is speculative at best , but such changes might increase the level of FAIM expression or enhance the anti-apoptotic activity of FAIM .
Recently , inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis by overexpression of FLIP was shown to increase lymphoma tum-origenicity [ 100 ] , [ 101 ] , supporting the concept that modulation of Fas signaling for cell 254 Rothstein TL death plays a role in determining the effectiveness of anti-tumor immunity , and providing a rationale for a connection between tumor-associated loci and anti-apoptotic genes like faim .
During our initial cloning efforts the faim sequence was obtained from two sources-a mouse thymus library and , subsequently , a mouse brain library .
However , the two sequences differ .
The original thymus-derived FAIM sequence , now termed FAIM-Short ( FAIM-S ) , is shorter by 22 5 amino acids in comparison to the brain-derived sequence , now termed FAIM-Long ( FAIM- L ) [ 96 ] .
Recently we identified a human faim-L homolog among publicly available EST fragments , which similarly encodes 22 additional 5 amino acids , 21 of which are identical to the additional sequence in murine FAIM-L , indicating a high degree of homology in this region , although this sequence contains no presently recognized effector motifs .
To clarify the origin of the two faim sequences , the mouse faim genomic locus was characterized [ 96 ] .
Mouse faim was localized to a region ( 9f1 ) syntenic to the chromosomal location of human faim by FISH analysis .
Three BAC clones containing the faim locus were obtained by screening a murine 1298y genomic library , and one of these clones was used as a template for analysis .
All intron/ exon boundaries were confirmed by direct sequencing [ 102 ] .
The murine faim locus was shown to consist of 6 exons .
Exons IV and VI in M. musculus were each found to represent the fusion of 2 exons identified in C. elegans , so that the intron/exon organization is simplified in the higher organism , which although unusual is not unprec- [ 103-107 ] .
Two putative translation initiation sites were identified on separate exons ( II and III ) , indicating that faim-L and faim-S result from alternative splicing .
Through PCR amplification utilizing a 5Â° primer that corresponds to the 5Â° untranslated region , faim-L was shown to be expressed in primary tissue , although among multiple tissues examined , expression of faim-L was extremely tissue-specific , and was strictly limited to the brain [ 96 ] .
The function of FAIM-L is presently unknown , and the possibility that FAIM-L is active only in the brain , or that FAIM-L fulfills a unique role in the brain , has not been ruled out .
These results indicate that faim is a novel gene without precedent in publicly available databases , whose protein product inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis , and whose expression is upregulated coordinately with induction of Fasg-resistance by slg engagement in vitro and during antigen-specific immune responses in vivo .
These features suggest that FAIM is involved in the physiological regulation of immune cell activity , inducibly suppressing Fas signaling for cell death along with and FLIP .
The multigenic nature of sIg-induced Fas-resistance suggests , in a larger sense , that the relative susceptibility of B cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis is determined by the balance between multiple pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules , whose expression changes rapidly in response to shifting environmental conditions , such as the presence of antigen and/ or T cell-derived lymphokine .
255 Inducible Fas-resistance in B cells Speculative role for Fas-resistance T cell activation results in upregulation of CD4O0L expression [ 108-110 ] , as well as upregulation of FasL expression [ 8 ] , [ 1111-114 ] .
As much as engagement of ( constitutively expressed ) B cell CD40 is necessary for T-dependent stimulation , CD40 triggering also upregulates Fas expression , and engagement of B cell Fas by T cell FasL initiates apoptotic events .
In view of this , activated T cells represent a potential threat to B cell viability , and this may well be the point at which inducible Fas-resistance plays a key role , by protecting B cells against FasL expressed by interacting Th1 cells and thereby promoting B cell immune responses .
Two manifestations of this have been documented .
1 ) Fas-resistant B cells present antigen more effectively than Fas-sensitive B cells .
This was demonstrated by experiments in which antigen-pulsed , mitomycin-treated Fas-resistant B cells produced greater proliferation of antigen-specific Th1 cells than did similarly treated , Fas-sensitive B cells [ 115 ] ; improved antigen presentation presumably occurred because Fas-resistant B cells were protected against the threat of death posed by initially activated T cells , and thus remained viable to present antigen to another round of T cells .
2 ) Fas-resistant B cells block activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) of T cells , whereas Fas-sensitive B cells do not .
This was demonstrated by experiments in which primed T cells were exposed a second time to antigen ( SEB or HEL ) presented by B cells ; the resulting Fas-induced cytotoxicity ( AICD ) of T cells was markedly reduced when antigen was presented by Fas-resistant B cells , presumably because Fas-bearing , apoptosis-resistant B cells competitively inhibited T cell FasL , preventing interaction with T cell Fas [ 116 ] .
These results suggest that Fas-resistance induced in B cells may enhance and perpetuate T , as well as B , cell responses .
The idea that inducible Fas-resistance modulates B and T cell deletion , and promotes B and T cell responses , is further supported , somewhat indirectly , by the observed durability of the receptor-specific phenotype , which was unchanged when B cells were washed and re-cultured for 24 h in medium prior to assay of Th1 cell-mediated cytotoxicity .
Fas-resistance in tolerant B cells The model described above , which suggests that inducible Fas-resistance acts to protect B cells from FasL-bearing , activated T cells , raises the issue of autoreactive B cells , the very B cells that are dysregulated in the absence of Fas expression .
Inasmuch as these B cells appear to be eliminated in a Fas-dependent fashion [ 15 ] , [ 117-121 ] , the induction of Fas-resistance ( as a result of interaction with ever present self antigen ) could lead to deleterious consequences , because of the possibility that normal processes of autoreactive B cell deletion might be thwarted .
It would seem necessary for the rules governing the regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis to be different for autoreactive B cells in comparison to normal ( foreign antigen-specific ) B cells .
To address this issue , B cells were obtained from transgenic mice expressing anti-HEL antigen receptors , and from double transgenic mice that express both the anti-HEL receptor as well as a transgene encoding soluble HEL ( anti-HEL/sHEL ) .
B cells 256 Rothstein TL from anti-HEL/sHEL mice are continually exposed to what is , for them , autoantigen , as a result of which these transgenically autoreactive B cells are tolerant , and thus do not signal normally through sIg [ 122-124 ] .
B cells from both kinds of transgenic mice were stimulated with CD4O0L alone or with CD4O0L in combination with soluble HEL , and tested for susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis .
The addition of soluble HEL produced resistance to Fas killing only in B cells from anti-HEL mice ; there was no effect of sHEL on the Fas-sensitivity of CD40L-stimulated B cells from anti-HEL/sHEL mice , despite the fact that upregulated levels of Fas expression and Fas-sensitivity produced by CD4O0L were similar for B cells obtained from single transgenic and double transgenic mice [ 36 ] .
Thus , specific antigen differentially induced Fas-resistance in non-autoreactive and in autoreactive B cells , succeeding in the former but failing in the latter .
However , it was noted that anti-Ig produced similar levels of Fas-resistance in CD40L-stimulated B cells from single and double transgenic mice , suggesting that autoreactive B cells are not totally intractable to induction of Fas-resistance through sIg signaling but , instead , may simply require a higher degree of slg crosslinking for this outcome .
To examine this issue , B cells from anti-HEL/sHEL mice were stimulated with CD4O0L alone or with CD40L in combination with biotinylated sHEL , with or without additional crosslinking imposed by streptavidin .
In the presence of streptavidin , autoreactive B cells from anti-HEL/sHEL mice acquired resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis , similar in magnitude to that produced by anti-Ig [ 36 ] .
These results strongly suggest that in autoreactive B cells an elevated threshold of slg signaling must be exceeded for induction of Fas-resistance , as compared to the degree of sIg signaling needed for induction of Fas-resistance in foreign-antigen-specific B cells .
In this way the possibility that self antigen might induce Fas-resistance through sIg signaling in autoreactive B cells is minimized , and sIg-induced Fas-resistance is unlikely to contribute to serological autoimmunity under normal circumstances .
The situation with IL-4 is very different .
Similar levels of Fas-resistance were produced by IL-4 in CD4O0L-stimulated B cells obtained from single and double transgenic mice [ 36 ] .
Thus , the capacity of IL-4R engagement to produce Fas-resistance was not altered in autoreactive B cells .
These results suggest the possibility that autoreactive B cells might escape Fas-dependent deletion because of IL-4R signaling ( which , under normal circumstances , would be averted by mechanisms that maintain T cell tolerance ) .
In support of this notion , serum samples ( 5 out of 5 tested ) obtained from IL-4-overexpressing transgenic mice [ 125 ] were found to contain autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells [ 37 ] .
HEp-2-staining serum autoantibodies were similarly reported in sera obtained from a separate IL-4 transgenic line [ 126 ] .
More recently , the role of IL-4 has been examined using the defined anti-HEL/sHEL system by breeding triple transgenic ( anti-HEL/sHEL/IL-4 ) animals and then testing sera for anti-HEL antibody .
Preliminary results indicate that these mice ( 10 out of 10 examined ) produced increasing amounts of serum anti-HEL autoantibody with increasing age , and in so doing broke tolerance .
Although none of these studies precludes the possibil- 257 Inducible Fas-resistance in B cells ity that IL-4 affects a non-B cell target , all are consistent with the ability of IL-4 to induce Fas-resistance and thereby interfere with the known Fas-deletional pathway for elimination of autoreactive B cells .
This conclusion is supported by the observation that constitutive expression of B7.2 led to a breakdown in tolerance in anti-HEL/sHEL transgenic mice [ 127 ] , which our results infer was due to complete stimulation of T cells to produce IL-4 which in turn induced B cell Fas-resistance .
The results discussed above suggest that induction of Fas-resistance , dysregulation of autoreactive B cells and disruption of B cell tolerance , along with the appearance of autoantibodies , could result either from slg stimulation that exceeds a certain threshold , as might be produced by immune complexes , or from IL-4R engagement not directly related to cognate interactions , as might occur during periods of heightened immuno-logical stress that may be accompanied by lymphokine overproduction [ 128 ] .
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION The most important conclusion to be drawn from these studies is that B cells are not monomorphic targets for Th1 cell-mediated cytotoxicity but rather modulate their own intrinsic susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis in response to specific environmental cues in a dynamic fashion in which Fas- sensitivity changes rapidly as a result of specific receptor binding .
Engagement of the B cell antigen receptor or the IL-4 receptor triggers at least partially non-overlapping , inducible pathways that result in a durable state of Fas-resistance that is mediated by Bel-xL , FLIP , and FAIM , and possibly other molecules that are as yet unknown .
Fas-resistance likely plays an important role during critical , early B cell : T cell interactions , protecting B cells from the inherent threat to survival posed by FasL expression on the part of activated T cells .
In this way inducible Fas-resistance is hypothesized to enhance serological immune responses and , perhaps , to promote T cell responses by improving antigen presentation and by blocking AICD .
Notably , Fas-resistance , as represented by the absence of functional Fas expression in mutant mice or by overexpression of FLIP in retrovirally transduced chimeras , produces serological autoreactivity , and thus may constitute an etiologic factor in clinically important autoimmunity [ 26 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 80 ] .
In other words , the presence or absence of receptor-induced Fas-resistance is likely to be a key element in determining the usefulness or aberrance of real world immune responses .
Modulation of Fas-sensitivity is not limited to B cells .
T cells may upregulate Fas expression but still fail to undergo apoptosis in response to Fas signaling .
This occurs shortly after activation through the T cell receptor in vitro .
With time and continued stimulation , the Fas-resistant phenotype reverses , and T cells become Fas-sensitive , without any change in the elevated level of Fas expression , perhaps as a result of IL-2R signaling and alterations in the levels of Bel-xL and FLIP , although the precise mechanism remains uncertain [ 76 ] , [ 129-133 ] .
Additional reports suggest that Fas-sensitivity is modulated in anergic T cells , memory T cells , primed T cells and Th2 cells [ 134-139 ] .
258 Rothstein TL Thus , inducible changes in the sensitivity of T cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis likely play a role in T cell homeostasis and in T cell immune responses .
Malignant cells , both lymphoid and non-lymphoid , manifest resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis [ 140-149 ] .
Inasmuch as inhibition of Fas signaling for cell death is associated with tumor development and progression , it appears that Fas-mediated apoptosis constitutes at least a portion of anti-tumor immunity , and that some malignancies take advantage of mechanisms that block Fas killing to maintain viability and co-exist within the framework of a normal immune system [ 100,101 ] , [ 150-153 ] .
The mechanisms utilized by malignant cells may represent perversions of the physiological means by which B cells normally inhibit susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis in a receptor-specific fashion .
If true , molecules involved in establishing sIg-induced Fas-resistance might form targets for pharmacologic manipulation of the apoptotic balance between host and tumor , including NF- Â« B , Bel-x1 , FLIP , and/or FAIM [ 51,56 , 68,76,154 , 155 ] .
The sum of the work described above , in conjunction with evidence provided by other investigators , strongly suggests that the regulation and dysregulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis contributes to the level and importance of normal immune , autoimmune , and tumor-immune responses .
New insights are likely to arise from further study of the inter-relationships between surface receptor engagement and susceptibility to Fas signaling , and of mechanisms and molecules responsible for inducible Fas-resistance , which may provide new targets for influencing normal and abnormal immune activity .
