5 Positive Regulators of the Lineage-Specific Transcription Factor GATA-1 in Differentiating Erythroid Cells MARGARET H. BARON® anp SARAH M. FARRINGTON Department of Cellular and Developmental Biology , The Biological Laboratories , Harvard University , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02138 Received 19 November 1993/Returned for modification 2 February 1994/Accepted 14 February 1994 The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1 is a major regulator of gene expression in erythroid , megakaryocyte , and mast cell lineages .
GATA-1 binds to WGATAR consensus motifs in the regulatory regions of virtually all erythroid cell-specific genes .
Analyses with cultured cells and cell-free systems have provided strong evidence that GATA-1 is involved in control of globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .
Targeted mutagenesis of the GATA-1 gene in embryonic stem cells has demonstrated its requirement in normal erythroid development .
Efficient rescue of the defect requires an intact GATA element in the distal promoter , suggesting autoregulatory control of GATA-1 transcription .
To examine whether GATA-1 expression involves additional regulatory factors or is maintained entirely by an autoregulatory loop , we have used a transient heterokaryon system to test the ability of erythroid factors to activate the GATA-1 gene in nonerythroid nuclei .
We show here that proerythroblasts and mature erythroid cells contain a diffusible activity ( TAG ) capable of transcriptional activation of GATA-1 and that this activity decreases during the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells .
Nuclei from GATA-1~ mutant embryonic stem cells can still be reprogrammed to express their globin genes in erythroid heterokaryons , indicating that de novo induction of GATA-1 is not required for globin gene activation following cell fusion .
The erythroid cell has provided an important paradigm for the study of vertebrate differentiation and development .
Erythroid cells are unique in their ability to activate the « - and B-like globin gene families , of which particular members are expressed at distinct stages of development ( reviewed in references 17 and 44 ) .
The first direct evidence that erythroid cell- and developmental stage-specific trans-acting regulatory factors are involved in the regulation of globin gene expression was provided by analyses of transient heterokaryons ( 4 ) .
Following fusion of erythroid with nonerythroid cells , globin genes of different developmental stages can be turned on in a variety of nonerythroid cell types of multiple embryonic lineages ( 4 , 5 ) .
A number of lineage-restricted transcription factors have since been identified in erythroid cells .
The zinc finger protein GATA-1 is a major regulator of gene expression in erythroid cell ( 15 , 47 ) , megakaryocyte ( 31 , 41 ) , and mast cell ( 31 ) lineages ( for reviews , see references 14 and 36 ) .
GATA-1 belongs to a family of related proteins ( 51 ) with distinct but partially overlapping patterns of expression ( 26 , 27 , 51 , 54 ) .
At least three members of this family ( GATA-1 , -2 , and -3 ) are expressed in erythroid cells ( 26 , 51 ) .
WGATAR consensus motifs have been found in the regulatory regions of virtually all erythroid cell-specific genes ( 15 , 18 , 30 , 33 , 47 , 49 , 52 ) .
Mutational and transactivation studies with cultured cells ( 16 , 21 , 29 ) and analyses of promoter function in erythroid cell-free systems ( 6 , 19 ) have implicated GATA-1 in the control of globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .
Normal development of erythroid cells requires functional GATA-1 protein , as demonstrated by targeted mutagenesis of the GATA-1 gene in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells ( 39 ) .

3108 rescue of the defect in the mutant ES cells ( 43 ) requires an intact GATA element ( 23 , 48 ) in the distal promoter , suggesting that a positive feedback loop functions in the regulation of the GATA-1 gene ( 48 ) .
To determine whether the expression of GATA-1 in erythroid cells involves other regulatory factors or is maintained entirely by an autoregulatory mechanism , we assayed for the presence of positive regulators of GATA-1 gene expression by fusing erythroid and nonerythroid cells to form transient heterokaryons .
These experiments identified a diffusible activity , here termed TAG , that mediates the transcriptional activation of GATA-1 .
TAG activity is present in both undifferentiated and mature erythroid cells .
Unlike GATA-1 , its level declines during terminal erythroid differentiation , suggesting that TAG and GATA-1 are distinct .
Thus , erythroid cells contain regulators not only of specialized end products of differentiation such as globins but also of a known transcriptional activator , GATA-1 .
However , de novo induction of the GATA-1 gene is not required for globin gene activation following cell fusion : GATA-1 protein provided by the donor erythroid cell appears sufficient to activate these genes in nonerythroid nuclei .
The implications of these findings for determination and differentiation of the erythroid lineage are discussed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and production of heterokaryons .
MEL , K562 , HeLa , and Raji ( human T-cell line ) cells , Epstein Barr virus-immortalized normal human B cells ( line DTC ) , C127 mouse fibroblasts , and mouse embryo fibroblasts were maintained in culture and heterokaryons were prepared as described previously ( 4 , 5 ) .
The mouse ES cell line CCE ( 40 ) was maintained as previously described ( 43 ) .
The GATA-1~ mutant line of ES cells was clone 74 of Pevny et al .

Isolation of total cellular RNA and quantitative RNase mapping .
Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method ( 11 ) .
RNase mapping ( 53 ) was performed as described previously ( 4 ) .
Templates for preparation of y-actin and mouse and human globin probes have been described ( 4 ) .
A probe corresponding to most of exon 2 ( +187 to +439 of genomic sequence ) from the mouse embryonic B-globin gene ( e ) was prepared by T7 RNA polymerase transcription of SP73MEmb ( RB ) .
Total cellular RNA from GM979 cells or mRNA from mouse yolk sac ( E11 ) protected a labeled fragment of 207 nucleotides ( nt ) .
The mouse-specific GATA-1 probe was prepared by transcription of Hindlll-linearized SP73mGF1 ( a Psfl-BsfEIl subclone of the reverse transcription [ RTJ-PCR amplification product from MEL cells ) with SP6 polymerase and yielded a protected fragment of 284 nt by RNase mapping .
The human-specific GATA-1 probe was synthesized with SP6 polymerase and BamHI-linearized SP73HGF1 template ( a Pvull-EcoRI subclone of the RT-PCR amplification product from K562 cells ) .
This probe yielded a protected fragment of 307 nt .
Semiquantitative RT-PCR assay .
RT of total cellular RNA ( 11 ) was carried out for 1 h at 42°C in a 50-pml volume containing 50 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 8.3 ) , 10 mM MgCl , , 30 mM KCI , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM each deoxynucleoside triphos-phate ( dNTP ) , 1.25 mg of oligo ( dT ) , 100 U of RNasin ( Pro-mega ) , 80 U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Life Sciences ) , and 10 ug of RNA .
All cDNA samples to be analyzed in a single experiment were synthesized at the same time , by addition of RNA and reverse transcriptase to a standard volume of a reaction mixture containing all other components , to minimize sample variability .
To further control for variability in RT , cDNAs were normalized to B-actin level with different dilutions of cDNA in a 100-pl PCR mixture .
Appropriate amounts of cDNA were assayed for expression of GATA-1 or globin in a 100-pl PCR mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.8 ) , 50 mM KCI , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.01 mg of bovine serum albumin , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.2 mM each dNTP , 2.5 U of Taq polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus ) , and 10 pmol of each primer .
( In pilot experiments , cycle number , amount of cDNA , and primer concentration were varied to assess conditions allowing quantitative comparison between samples . )
PCR conditions were 94°C for 1 min ; 55°C for 1 min ; 72°C for 1 min plus 3 s per cycle for 25 cycles ; and then 72°C for 6 min .
Amplification product specificity was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion pattern ( not shown ) and by DNA blotting .
PCR primers were mouse GATA-1 ( sense ) , 5-CCG CAAGGCATCTGGCAAA-3 ' ; mouse GATA-1 ( antisense ) , 5'-CGGGAGGTAGAGGCAGGA-3 ' ; mouse B-actin ( sense ) , 5'-GAGGCCCAGAGCAAGAG-3 ' ; mouse B-actin ( antisense ) , 5'-CCGGACTCATCGTACTC-3 ' ; human GATA-1 ( sense ) , AGGATGGTATTCAGACTC-3 ' ; and human GATA-1 ( antisense ) , 5-GAAGGTTCAAGCCAGGGG-3 ' .
DNA blotting .
Ten microliters of each PCR mixture was electrophoresed through an agarose gel , blotted onto nylon ( Zetaprobe ; Bio-Rad ) , and hybridized with random-primed GATA-1 and B-actin probes under standard conditions ( 42 ) .
Hybridization probes were as follows : human GATA-1 ( 307-bp Pvull-EcoRI cDNA fragment ) , mouse GATA-1 ( 284-bp Pstfl-BstEIl cDNA fragment ) , human Gg ( 180-bp genomic Sacl fragment excised from ( 2 ) , and mouse B-actin ( 934-bp PCR product ) .
With the exception of B-actin , probes for Southern blotting hybridized to sequences internal to the PCR primers .
Blots were washed at a high stringency and were then exposed to preflashed X-ray film .

General experimental design .
In the example shown here , PEG-mediated fusion of human erythroid and mouse nonerythroid cells results in the transcriptional activation of mouse globin genes ( 4 ) .
Heterokaryon production is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after staining with the fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 .
Human nuclei stain diffusely , while mouse nuclei have a punctate appearance ( 8 ) .
Heterokaryons ( short-term hybrids ) do not divide , their nuclei do not fuse , and chromosome loss does not occur .
Thus , the observed activation of globin gene expression must be mediated in frans .
RESULTS Activation of GATA-1 by diffusible regulators in erythroid cells .
The general design of these experiments is depicted schematically in Fig .
1 .
Human or mouse erythroid cells were fused with nonerythroid cells of the other species to form intertypic heterokaryons ( 4 , 5 ) .
After 1 to 2 days in culture , cells were harvested for isolation of total cellular RNA or for fluorescence microscopy to confirm formation of heterokaryons .
RNA was examined for de novo activation of GATA-1 in the nonerythroid nuclei by quantitative RNase mapping ( 4 , 5 ) or by a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis .
The RT-PCR assay was developed to increase the sensitivity of detection of gene expression in transient heterokaryons .
We had previously shown that globin genes are rapidly and specifically activated in nonerythroid nuclei after cell fusion ( 4 , 5 ) .
These experiments demonstrated that erythroid cells contain tissue- and stage-specific diffusible factors involved in globin gene regulation .
To determine whether known transcriptional regulators are also induced after cell fusion , we 3110 BARON AND FARRINGTON tJ » 4 FIG .

The normally silent GATA-1 gene is activated in erythroid heterokaryons .
K652 cells were fused with mouse ES cells to form heterokaryons .
Total cellular RNA was prepared after 48 h and was analyzed by RT-PCR and DNA blotting .
PCR products from a cloned mouse GATA-1 DNA template ( 47 ) ( lane 5 ) and from mouse erythroid ( MEL ) cell cDNA ( lane 6 ) served as positive controls .
Amplification of mouse GATA-1 yielded a product of 473 bp .

Human erythroid K562 cells ( 28 ) were fused with normal mouse ES cells ( 40 ) , which do not express GATA-1 or globin genes ( 43 ) .
Total cellular RNA isolated from unfused or fused mixtures of K562 and ES cells was converted into cDNA by RT , and a portion of each cDNA sample was then used as template in a PCR with species-specific primers ( Fig .
2 ) .
Although no mouse GATA-1 was detected in RNA from unfused mixtures of cells ( U , lane 3 ) , a 473-bp GATA-1 product was easily detected in fused cells ( F , lane 4 ) .
Therefore , the human erythroid cells contain a diffusible activity ( TAG ) capable of transcriptional activation of GATA-L. A DMSO ( days ) ___ n llc. , Mor .

Regulators of GATA-1 in proerythroblasts and in terminally differentiating erythroid cells .
Mouse erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells are adult proerythroblasts transformed by the Friend virus complex ( 20 ) .
Following treatment with chemical inducers such as dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , MEL cells undergo terminal differentiation accompanied by transcriptional activation of their globin genes ( 25 ) .
To determine whether TAG activity is equally abundant in undifferentiated and mature erythroid cells , MEL cells treated for different times with DMSO were fused with human nonerythroid cells ( B lympho-cytes ) ( Fig .
3A ) .
Human GATA-1 ( 457-bp product ) was activated in the B-lymphocyte nuclei after fusion with undifferentiated MEL cells ( lane 2 ) or with MEL cells induced to differentiate for 1 , 2 , or 3 days prior to fusion ( lanes 4 , 6 , and 8 , respectively ) .
Notably , the ability of DMSO-treated MEL cells to activate the human GATA-1 gene in nonerythroid nuclei decreased during terminal differentiation ( Fig .
3A , compare lanes 6 and 8 ) , although the mouse GATA-1 gene is constitutively expressed ( Fig .
3B ) ( 2 , 47 ) .
This decrease is not the trivial result of differences in fusion efficiencies ; uninduced and DMSO-induced MEL cells fuse with similar efficiency , as assessed by Hoechst staining of heterokaryons ( 2 , 4 ) .
This point is further demonstrated by the activation of human adult globin genes in nonerythroid cells after fusion with uninduced or induced MEL cells ( 4 , 5 ) , and by the substantial activation of the mouse embryonic B-like globin gene ( e ) in heterokaryons formed by fusion of either induced or uninduced MEL cells with human embryonic erythroid ( K562 ) cells ( 4 ) ( Fig .
4 , compare lane 2 with lanes 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) .
These observations suggest that TAG is distinct from GATA-1 .
Similar results were obtained when undifferentiated or induced MEL cells were fused with human epithelial ( HeLa ) cells or T ( Raji ) lymphocytes ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , autoactivation by GATA-1 protein may not be sufficient to induce the GATA-1 gene in nonexpressing cells , a conclusion which is supported by transfection experiments ( 35 ) .
GATA-1 activation was not detected in homokaryons formed by polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) treatment of nonerythroid cells alone ( data not shown ) .

Mouse embryonic B-globin ( e ) is strongly activated by regulators in human embryonic erythroid cells .
MEL cells induced to differentiate in DMSO-containing medium for 0 to 4 days were fused with K562 cells .
RNA was prepared 48 h later and was analyzed by RNase protection with a mixture of mouse GATA-1 and e-globin riboprobes ( sizes of protected fragments were 284 and 207 nt , respectively ) .
Portions of each RNA sample were analyzed in parallel for expression of human GATA-1 ( 307 nt ) and y-actin ( 135 nt ) .
Down-regulation of TAG activity during erythroid cell mat-uration .
The decline in TAG activity in terminally differentiating MEL cells is unlikely to result from the production of general repressors of transcription during erythroid matura-tion , because mouse GATA-1 and globin RNA levels remained high for as long as 7 days ( Fig .
3B and data not shown ) .
Down-regulation of TAG activity during differentiation might result from the loss of positive activators of GATA-1 ( distinct from GATA-1 itself ) or from inhibition of GATA-1 activity ( and hence of positive autoregulation ) .
To distinguish these possibilities , heterokaryons were prepared by fusion of human erythroid K562 cells with MEL cells treated with DMSO for 0 to 4 days .
As a measure of GATA-1 activity , we followed the induction of the mouse embryonic B-like globin gene , e ( 4 , 5 ) .
A dramatic activation of the mouse e-globin gene was observed in nuclei of both undifferentiated ( Fig .
4 , lane 2 ) and differentiated ( Fig .
4 , lanes 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) MEL cells after fusion with human K562 cells , suggesting that factors in the differentiating MEL cell do not repress or inhibit human and/or mouse GATA-1 activity ( or the activity of other activators of globin gene expression ) .
The declining levels of TAG in differentiating MEL cells ( Fig .
3A ) are apparently compensated for by the human erythroid regulatory molecules contributed by K562 cells .
In these experiments , as reported previously ( 4 ) , human adult -globin was reciprocally activated in the K562 nuclei ( not shown ) .
In Fig .
4 , the apparent decrease in mouse GATA-1 RNA levels reflects the withdrawal of differentiating MEL cells ( 22 ) and heterokaryons ( 8 , 12 ) from the cell cycle .
Terminally differentiating MEL cells and heterokaryons are overgrown by POSITIVE REGULATORS OF GATA-1 IN ERYTHROID CELLS 3111 the actively proliferating K562 cells in mixed fusion cultures .
These changes were reflected in a 12- to 25-fold decrease ( determined in titration experiments [ data not shown ] ) in the contribution of mouse GATA-1 to total cellular RNA with increasing time of exposure to DMSO ( Fig .
4 , compare lanes 1 and 2 with 9 and 10 ) , while the level of human GATA-1 ( Fig .
4 , bottom panel ) remained essentially constant .
No changes in mouse GATA-1 RNA levels were observed when induced or uninduced MEL cells alone were treated with PEG to form homokaryons ( not shown ) .
Activation of globin genes following cell fusion .
In transient heterokaryons , the erythroid fusion partner thus provides both GATA-1 and TAG activity .
The activation of globin genes in transient heterokaryons may occur directly , through the action of GATA-1 and other proteins provided by the donor erythroid cell , or indirectly , requiring first the induction of GATA-1 gene expression by TAG in the nonerythroid nuclei and then the secondary activation of globin genes .
To determine whether the nonerythroid mouse nuclei must activate mouse GATA-1 de novo in order to turn on globin gene expression , K562 cells were fused with wild-type ES cells or with ES cells carrying a mutation in the GATA-1 gene ( 39 ) .
Mouse a- and e-globin genes were activated in heterokaryons prepared from both wild-type and mutant ( GATA-1~ ) ES cells ( Fig .
5 , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The mutant ES cells do not express detectable GATA-1 RNA or protein ( 43 ) , nor can they give rise to mature erythroid cells in vitro ( 43 ) or in chimeric mice ( 39 ) .
Therefore , the human GATA-1 protein provided by the erythroid cell fusion partner is sufficient for activation of globin genes in the mouse nonerythroid nuclei .
DISCUSSION Mechanisms of cellular specialization .
Differentiation can be generally defined as the process by which the unique phenotype of a determined cell is established .
Analysis of gene expression in multinucleated heterokaryons produced by fusion of two different cell types has revealed that the differentiated state is reversible and can be reprogrammed in the presence of appropriate combinations of trans-acting regulators ( reviewed in references 3 and 7 ) .
These observations have led to the view , supported by work in other experimental systems , that specialized cellular phenotypes are maintained by a dynamic , ongoing interplay among positive and negative regulatory molecules ( 3 , 7 ) .
Activation of tissue-specific genes in heterokaryons depends on gene dosage ( 32 , 37 ) .
In principle , activation could be achieved simply through a direct mechanism involving comple-mentation of one or more deficiencies in the nonexpressing cell or alteration of the balance of positive and negative regulators .
A more indirect mechanism was suggested by studies on muscle cell differentiation .
Fusion of mouse myoblasts with human nonmuscle cells resulted in the early induction of human muscle regulators .
This induction was later followed by the reciprocal , secondary activation of mouse muscle genes , presumably by the newly induced human regulators ( 24 ) .
These findings foreshadowed the discovery of the autoregulatory and cross-regulatory activities of the myogenic group of basic helix-loop-helix proteins ( 9 , 45 ) .
Members of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix family are among the regulators now known to be induced in muscle heterokaryons ( 38 , 46 ) .
Erythoid cell differentiation .
We have previously shown that the expressed state of globin genes is not irreversible and that several aspects of normal globin gene regulation are reproduced in erythroid heterokaryons ( 4 , 5 ) .

De novo production of GATA-1 is not required for globin gene activation in transient heterokaryons .

activation after fusion of erythroid and nonerythroid cells , we have examined the induction and expression of the lineage-specific transcription factor GATA-1 ( reviewed in references 14 and 36 ) .
GATA-1 is believed to be a critical regulatory component of the B-globin locus control region ( 13 ) and of erythroid gene promoters ( 50 ) , including those of globin genes 4 GATA I ATAG & Autoregulation ( 6 , 19 , 21 ) .
Expression of the GATA-1 gene is essential for erythroid cell development and differentiation ( 39 , 43 ) .
The experiments reported here define a novel activity ( TAG ) in human and mouse erythroid cells that functions upstream of ( or in concert with ) GATA-1 to activate its expression ( Fig .
6 ) .
Erythroid cells therefore contain a com 4 Activation of erythroid-specific genes FIG .

Model for activation and maintained expression of the GATA-1 gene during erythroid differentiation .
The initial activation of GATA-1 in erythroid progenitor cells might be triggered by TAG , alone or in combination with other regulatory factors .
High-level expression of the GATA-1 gene during normal erythroid development would then be achieved and stably maintained by a positive feedback loop , as suggested by other studies ( 23 , 43 , 48 ) .

GATA-1 itself is constitutively expressed during MEL cell differentiation , possibly through an autoregulatory mechanism .
However , its activation de novo is not required to turn on globin gene expression in the nonerythroid nuclei of heterokaryons .
This observation suggests that TAG per se is not directly involved in globin gene activation .
We note that the cell fusion experiments reported here can not provide direct information about the mechanism of activation of GATA-1 .
Because PEG-mediated cell fusion produces a heterogeneous population containing heterokaryons , homokaryons , and unfused cells , only activation ( but not suppression or extinction ) of gene expression is detected by either of the RNA assays used here .
Therefore , TAG might function either as a direct positive activator of GATA-1 or in the inactivation of a repressor of the GATA-1 gene .
A model for GATA-1 activation and expression in developing erythroid cells .
Numerous studies in other systems have established that the regulators responsible for the initial activation of a gene are not necessarily the ones required to maintain expression of that gene at later times during development .
In this report we have shown that terminally differentiating erythroid ( MEL ) cells begin to lose a factor ( s ) required for de novo activation of GATA-1 transcription , perhaps because TAG activity is no longer needed in the mature erythroid cell .
The decline in TAG activity in differentiating MEL cells suggests the possibility that , in vivo , TAG functions as a positive `` hit-and-run '' component ( 3 ) of the erythroid lineage switch .
According to this model , TAG would trigger the initial activation of GATA-1 .
Other proteins , such as GATA-1 itself , would compensate for declining levels of TAG by taking over its function at later times during erythroid cell differentiation .
GATA-1 is a member of a family of related proteins ( 51 ) , at least three of which are expressed in erythroid cells at various stages of their maturation ( 26 , 27 , 51 ) .
In vivo , the double GATA consensus binding site found upstream of the murine GATA-1 gene ( 48 ) could potentially be occupied not only by GATA-1 but also by GATA-2 or GATA-3 as well .
The expression pattern of TAG is reminiscent of that of GATA-2 , which is down-regulated as erythroid cells mature ( 10 , 26 , 27 ) .
Therefore , GATA-2 might be identical to or a component of TAG .
Recent evidence suggests that GATA-2 plays a role in maintaining early erythroid progenitors in an actively proliferating state ( 10 ) .
We speculate that TAG activity may be expressed in the earliest erythroid progenitors , prior to activation of GATA-1 itself .
Following the initial activation of GATA-1 by TAG , high-level expression of the GATA-1 gene could be achieved and stably maintained by a positive feedback loop ( 23 , 43 , 48 ) ( diagrammed schematically in Fig .
6 ) .
TAG may not function exclusively in the control of GATA-1 expression but may be involved in the regulation of other erythroid transcription factors such as NF-E2 ( 1 ) or EKLF ( 34 ) during normal erythroid development .
