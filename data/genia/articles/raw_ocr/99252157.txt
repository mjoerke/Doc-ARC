To interpret the mechanisms by which EBV activates the cell , we have assayed many proteins involved in control of the G , and G , phases of the cell cycle and regulation of apoptosis .
In EBV infection most of the changes , including the early induction of cyclin D2 , are dependent on expression of EBV genes , but an alteration in the E2F-4 profile was partly independent of viral gene expression , presumably occurring in response to signal transduction activated when the virus binds to its receptor , CD21 .
By comparing the expression of genes controlling apoptosis , including those encoding several members of the BCL-2 family of proteins , the known relative resistance of EBV-immortalized B-cell lines to apoptosis induced by low serum was found to correlate with expression of both BCL-2 and A20 .
A20 can be regulated by the NF-KB transcription factor , which is known to be activated by the EBV LMP-1 protein .
Quantitative assays demonstrated a direct temporal relationship between LMP-1 protein levels and active NF-B during the time course of infection .
When Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infects resting human B lymphocytes , it drives the cells into the cell cycle and maintains cell division .
The lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) that arise from this type of EBV infection are relatively resistant to apoptosis caused by deprivation of serum growth factors .
Cells of this LCL type are produced in vivo upon primary infection of humans but are then eliminated by the immune response , asymptomatically in infants but in adults in the course of the disease known as infectious mononucleosis .
In the absence of normal immune surveillance , cells of the LCL type can develop into lymphomas ( reviewed in reference 61 ) .
Genetic analysis of EBV has demonstrated several viral genes that are required for initiation and maintenance of growth .
These include the genes that encode the nuclear proteins EBNA-1 , EBNA-2 , EBNA-LP , EBNA-3A , and EBNA-3C and the plasma membrane protein LMP -1 ( reviewed in references 22 and 23 ) .
Some of the biochemical functions of these proteins are now becoming clear .
EBNA-1 is required for EBV plasmid maintenance , EBNA-2 causes transcription activation through several interactions ( including the Notch pathway ) , and EBNA-LP is able to cooperate with EBNA-2 in regulation of some genes .
EBNA-3C causes cells to progress through cell cycle check points in both G , and G ; , /M by an unknown mechanism , and the partly related EBNA-3A protein has effects on gene regulation ( 15 ) .
The LMP-1 protein activates signalling through several transduction pathways , including TRAF- and TRADD-mediated activation of NF-kB ( 10 , 19 , 30 , 47 , 64 ) and activation of SAP/JNK1 kinase , leading to c-Jun phosphorylation ( 20 , 34 ) .
The EBV immortalization genes are not all expressed simultaneously upon infection ; EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 are * Corresponding author .

4678 the first to be expressed , followed by the remaining EBNA proteins and then LMP We have studied the mechanism by which the resting B cells which EBV infects are driven into the cell cycle and the expression of genes that may control apoptosis during the infection of B cells We and others have shown previously that binding of the virus to its receptor on the B-cell surface ( CD21 ) not only mediates uptake of the virus but also results in signal transduction ( 71 , 72 ) , which preactivates the cell , enabling expression of transfected genes and giving an early transient activation of NF- « B ( 75 ) .
In B cells preactivated by exposure to purified gp340 ( a form of the EBV surface glycoprotein which mediates virus binding to CD21 ) , we showed that transfection of the first two viral genes known to be expressed during infection ( EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 ) resulted in induction of the RNA encoding an early marker of cell cycle entry , cyclin D2 ( 72 ) .
Cyclin-dependent kinases ( ecdks ) control cell cycle progression partly through the E2F family of transcription factors and the pocket proteins , Rb , p107 , and p130 , that can bind the various E2F complexes ( 65 ) .
Here we study the expression of these proteins during the time course of EBV infection , when EBV drives the cells into cycle , and describe modifications to the E2F profile that are dependent upon virus infection , some of which require viral protein synthesis .
Current models for entry of resting cells into the cell cycle in response to serum stimulation imply a key early role for E2F4 and p130 proteins in governing the G , -to-G , transition ( 45 , 73 , 78 ) ; it has so far been unclear whether activation of the cells by EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 is mediated through a direct effect on E2F-pocket protein complexes or through activation of cyclin expression .
Here we show that the timing of changes we have detected in E2F and pocket proteins and the induction of cyclin D2 protein upon EBV infection are consistent with a cyclin D2-cdk complex mediating activation of the cell cycle .
Once the cells are established in cycle , the EBNA-2 , EBNA-3C , and LMP-1 proteins are thought to control cell growth ( 32 , 35 , 56 ) .
Prevention of apoptosis is now recognized to be as important as proliferation in determining the overall increase in cell num- voL .
73 , 1999 ber in various cell types .
In certain circumstances B lymphocytes are particularly prone to apoptosis , which is the main mechanism by which cells bearing self-reactive and low-affinity immunoglobulins are eliminated , particularly through Fas-mediated apoptosis ( 3 ) .
EBV-immortalized B cells are relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by low serum .
Resting B cells contain relatively high levels of BCL-2 protein , similar to LCL cells , and BCL-2 has been shown to protect B cells against apoptosis .
BCL-2 expression can also be induced by the EBV LMP -1 protein ( 28 ) .
In fact , BCL-2 is merely the prototypical member of a family of related proteins which are key regulators of apoptosis ( 16 , 17 , 48 , 58 , 59 , 83 ) .
The family also includes BCL-X ; , , and MCL-1 ( which , like BCL-2 , suppress apoptosis ) and BAX , BAD , and BAK , which promote cell death ( 7 , 13 , 24 , 33 , 49 , 60 , 84 ) .
These proteins form various heterodimers and homodimers , and it is likely that the interactions among them are critical to BCL-2 family functions ( 58 , 67 , 68 ) .
BAX is central to the BCL-2 family of proteins , since it interacts with several antiapoptotic family members , including BCL-2 , BCL-X ; , and MCL-1 .
The BCL-2 homology ( BH ) domains 1 and 2 define the family , and BHI1 and BH2 of BCL-2 are required for interaction with BAX and for suppression of apoptosis ( 85 ) .
In contrast , BAX BH3 domain is required for association with BCL-2 and promotion of apoptosis ( 86 ) .
In addition to dimerization , further complexity is present , since multiple isoforms of some family members are generated via alternate splicing , and these may be functionally distinct .
For example , the alternate BCL-X form , lacks BHI1 and BH2 and promotes apoptosis ( 7 ) .
The balance of the levels of these various proteins , rather than the simple expression of BCL-2 , is a key aspect of the regulation of apoptosis , but there is little knowledge of their levels in EBV-immortalized B cells and their relative importance .
A further regulator of apoptosis present in LCLs is the A20 protein .
A20 is a ring finger protein which suppresses apoptosis and can be induced by LMP ( 26 , 39 , 50 , 51 , 66 ) .
We have measured the levels of these apoptosis-regulatory gene products in a panel of cell lines , including LCLs and Burkitt 's lymphomas ( BLs ) , with or without EBV immortalizing-gene expression .
The results suggest that , in addition to BCL-2 , the A20 antiapoptotic protein may also have a role in preventing the sensitivity of LCLs to apoptosis induced by low serum .
The A20 promoter can be regulated by LMP -1 through its NF-KB site ( 39 ) , and we have directly measured the induction of active nuclear NF-kB during primary infection , showing that it correlates with LMP-1 expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of B cells , EBV , and virus infections .
Primary B cells from peripheral blood were isolated as described previously ( 12 , 72 ) .
Buffy coats were centrifuged over Ficoll-Pague ( Pharmacia LKB ) gradients , and CD19-positive lymphocytes were immunoselected with pan-B Dynabeads M450 ( Dynal ) .
The beads were removed by competition with Detachabeads ( Dynal ) , and the cells were resuspended at 10 % /ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , and 15 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum .
The cells were incubated for 40 h prior to infection with EBV or treatment with 30 ng of PMA ( phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ) as indicated .
UV radiation inactivation of EBV prior to infection was performed in a Stratalinker with 9 J of UV radiation .
Tonsil B cells were purified by negative selection .
Single-cell suspensions prepared from fresh tonsils were centrifuged over Ficoll-Paque .
T cells were removed by rosetting with 5-2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide ( AET ' ) -treated sheep erythrocytes followed by centrifugation over Percoll ( specific gravity , 1.08 ; Pharmacia Bio-tech ) .
The dense resting B cells were further isolated by centrifugation over Percoll at a specific gravity of 1.074 and resuspended at 10 % /ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , and 15 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum .
The isolated cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for purity and DNA content with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated anti-CD20 and propidium iodide , respectively .
The cells were infected with the B95-8 strain of EBV as described previously ( 28a ) .
Cell lines and apoptosis assay .
BL41 , DG75 ( 6 ) , BL40 , and BL2 ( 40 ) are EBV-negative BL cell lines .
Akata ( 76 ) and Elijah are EBV-positive BL cell lines CELL CYCLE AND APOPTOSIS IN EBV INFECTION - 4679 that have retained a group I phenotype ( 62 ) .
Mutu III clone 148 , BL72 ( 40 ) , and WewakI ( 62 ) are EBV-positive BL cell lines that have acquired a group III phenotype .
Namalwa ( 37 ) , Raji ( 57 ) , and BL74 ( 40 ) are EBV-positive BL cell lines with the intermediate group II phenotype .
BL36-LCL , PF-LCL , LCL3 , IB4 ( 36 ) , and X50-7 ( 82 ) are in vitro EBV-immortalized LCLs .
The cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco-BRL ) supplemented with 10 to 15 % ( vol/vol ) fetal calf serum and antibiotics .
To test the sensitivity of cell lines to Fas-induced apoptosis , the cells were diluted to 10° per ml and treated with 100 or 500 ng of an anti-Fas immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) class antibody ( no .
05-201 ; Upstate Biotechnology Inc. ) /ml or were left untreated as a control .
The anti-Fas antibody had x light chains so , as an additional control , cells were treated with equivalent concentrations of an unrelated Ig M ( x ) antibody ( Pharmingen 03081D ) that had been dialyzed to remove azide .
After 24 h , cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion as a measure of cell membrane permeability .
Cell genomic DNA was analyzed as previously described ( 4 ) .
Cell proliferation measured by [ H ] thymidine incorporation .
Uninfected or EBV-infected cells ( 2 x 10° ) were pulse labelled for 2 h with 1 wCi of midine per well and harvested onto glass fiber filters with a cell harvester ( Ska-tron Ltd. , Lier , Norway ) .
The filters were air dried , and scintillations were counted .
Immunoblotting , immunofluorescence , and antibodies .
Radicimmunoprecipi-tation assay lysates were prepared and quantitated , and immunoblotting was performed as previously described ( 9 ) .
Proteins were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocel-lulose membranes .
After being blocked with 10 % milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline , the membranes were probed with the following antibodies ( all antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibodies unless otherwise indicated ) .
The antibodies used were a 1/10 dilution of anti-EBNA-LP monoclonal JF 186 ( 25 ) , 1/500 dilution of anti-EBNA-2 monoclonal antibody PE2 ( Dako ) , 1/10 dilution of anti-LMP-1 monoclonal $ 12 ( 41 ) , 1/1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-p107 ( C-18 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-pRB ( C-15 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-p130 ( C-20 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/80 dilution of anti-cyclin D2 ( G132-43 ; Pharmingen ) , 1/500 dilution of anti-cyclin E ( HE12 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/700 dilution of anti-E2F-1 ( KH-95 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-E2F-4 ( C-108 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-p27 ( C-19 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-edk2 ( M2 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 1/500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-cdk4 ( C-22 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and 1/1,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-edk6 ( C-21 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Three rabbit BAX antibodies were used .
BAX N-20 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used at 0.4 pg/ml , BAX P-19 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used at 0.5 ug/ml , and BAX 13666E ( Pharmingen ) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000 .
The -specific rabbit antibody S-18 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used at 0.4 ug/ml , the BCL-2 antibody C124 ( Dako ) was used at 1 pg/ml , the BAK-specific goat antibody G-23 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used at 0.5 pg/ml , and the BAG-1-specific rabbit antibody C-16 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used at 0.5 ug/ral .
The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig or sheep anti-mouse Ig ( both Amersham ) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat Ig ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Bound immu-nocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
For immunofluorescent detection of EBNA-LP , cytospins were prepared from uninfected and EBV-infected cells 30 h after infection and fixed in 1:1 methanol-acetone .
The cells were stained with JF186 ( 1:10 dilution ) followed by FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG ( Sigma ) or the secondary antibody alone .
Positive cells were counted by fluorescent microscopy .
RNase protection assay and Northern blotting .
Northern blotting and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously ( 4 , 71 , 72 ) with cytoplasmic RNA .
The A20 probe for Northern blotting contained nucleotides 337 to 1614 of the cDNA ( 50 ) , kindly provided by V. M. Dixit .
For the A20 RNAse protection assay , nucleotides 2218 to 1705 of the cDNA were subcloned to make the probe .
The E2F-4 RNAse protection probe contained nucleotides 531 to 246 of the E2F-4 cDNA ( 5 ) and was made by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase from the plasmid peDNA3-E2F4AApal ( a kind gift of E. Lam ) lin-earized with BstXL .
Gel retardation assay .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide , AGTTGAGGGG ACTITCCCAGGC , was end-labelled with T4 polynucleotide kinase .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 54 ) .
For each assay , 5 mg of LCL3 extract protein or an equivalent amount of extract ( primary B-cell infec-tions ) was incubated in a final reaction volume of 20 l containing 40 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 7.5 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM 2-mercaptocthanol , 4 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , 1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml , 0.1 mg of poly ( dIC ) /ml , and 50 ng of *°P-labelled oligonucleotide for 30 min at 25°C .
Samples were electrophoresed on 4 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA .
RESULTS In the experiments we have published previously on the early events after EBV infection of B cells , the B cells were purified 4680 SPENDER ET AL .
by positive selection of peripheral blood lymphocytes on CD19 beads ( 12 , 72 ) .
CD19 is part of the membrane complex containing the EBV receptor ( CD21 ) .
There was , therefore , the possibility that the selection process might have affected the signal transduction and G , , status of the purified B cells , even though our standard procedure involved an overnight incubation in medium after the purification to allow any transduction effects of the purification process to dissipate .
Although most parameters ( very low [ °H ] thymidine incorporation , 2 N DNA content , and cell surface and intracellular markers ) were as expected for resting cells ( 12 , 72 ) , we have found some variation in the level of hypophosphorylated p130 in the purified B cells .
This seemed to be more a consequence of variation in the batches of buffy coats used for B-cell purification than a result of the positive selection protocol .
Nevertheless , the purification procedure was modified , increasing the recovery period to 40 h. With this revised purification procedure , the cells were confirmed as predominately resting B cells , since they were CD20 positive and CD23 negative , lacked measurable [ °HJthy-midine incorporation , and lacked G- or S-phase cells in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis ( Fig .
1 and data not shown ) .
Furthermore , p130 levels in the purified-B-cell population were consistently normal and similar to those of resting B cells purified from tonsils by a negative selection protocol ( Fig .
2 ) .
Other types of resting ( G , ) cells have been shown to contain an E2F factor made up of E2F-4 complexed with a DP protein bound to the transcriptionally repressive pocket protein p130 ( 45 , 73 , 78 ) .
The resting B cells were shown also to express E2F-4 ( Fig .
2 ) .
The purified B cells are thus in G , by all criteria that we have been able to measure .
Purified resting cells were infected with EBV , and the expression of viral and cell proteins at various times after infection was monitored by Western blotting extracts of the cells .
As we have shown previously ( 72 ) , the cells begin to enter S phase about 48 to 72 h after infection under these conditions ( Fig .
1 ) .
Cell death in the cultures was found to be relatively low : about 70 % of the cells remained viable by trypan blue exclusion ( Fig .
1 ) , consistent with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells , which showed about 30 % of the cells with a sub-G , DNA content at 72 h after the addition of virus .
The viral proteins EBNA-LP , EBNA-2 , and LMP -1 were assayed .
As shown previously ( 72 ) , EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 are the earliest viral proteins that can be detected ( Fig .
2 ) .
These transcription factors are assumed to modify the activity of cell genes or proteins , but the relevant early cell targets have not yet been identified .
Across the same time course of infection , the E2F-1 and E2F-4 proteins were in-duced , with E2F-1 being undetectable or present at only a very low level in the uninfected cells at the start of the experiments ( Fig .
2 ) .
E2F-4 was present as multiple bands ; the slower-migrating forms are thought perhaps to represent phosphorylated forms of the protein ( 78 , 79 ) .
The level of the slower-migrating forms of E2F-4 was reduced during the infection time course , but the overall level of E2F-4 detected by Western blotting was increased ( Fig .
2 ) .
The levels of the pRb and p107 pocket proteins were very low or undetectable in the uninfected cells , but both p107 and pRb were induced upon infection , with phosphorylated forms of pRb appearing about 30 h after infection .
In contrast , p130 levels did not increase , but slower-migrating forms , presumably with different phosphorylation states , appeared later , about 48 h after the addition of virus .
PMA treatment of the B cells ( which drives the cells into division ) induced changes in E2F-1 , E2F-4 , and the pocket proteins similar to those of EBV infection ( Fig .
2 ) .
We demonstrated previously that cyclin D2 RNA was induced by EBV as early as 24 h after infection in our system J. Virou .
( 72 ) , and this has now been confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting ( Fig .
3 ) .
Cyclin E was found to be induced at about the same time the level of p27 protein declined abruptly , perhaps consistent with targeted degradation of p27 , as has been reported in other systems of cell cycle entry ( 55 , 69 , 80 ) .
Although we previously reported induction of edk-2 , -4 , and -6 proteins from very low levels upon EBV infection ( 12 ) , it is now clear with improved detection methods that there is detectable cdk-2 , -4 , and -6 in the uninfected cells but that all these edks are induced further upon EBV infection .
Some of the induction of edk-2 also occurred when the cells were cultured in the absence of EBV ( Fig .
3 ) .
Again , PMA treatment of the B cells resulted in changes to the profile of cyclin D2 , p27 , and edks similar to those in EBV infection .
To distinguish which of these effects was dependent on viral gene expression , the levels of cyclin D2 , p130 , E2F-4 , and p27 proteins were measured at 24 and 48 h after infection with EBV or UV -inactivated EBV ( Fig .
4A ) .
After UV inactivation , the virus particles remain but viral gene expression is prevented ( the effectiveness of the UV inactivation was verified by monitoring expression of EBNA-LP , which was prevented by the UV treatment ) .
The results ( Fig .
4A ) show that the induction of cyclin D2 protein , the altered gel mobility ( presumed hyperphosphorylation ) of p130 , and the reduction in p27 levels were all dependent on viral gene expression , since the effects were prevented by UV inactivation of the virus .
The changes in the migration pattern of E2F-4 upon EBV infection were also analyzed , comparing the effects of UV-inactivated EBV with those of wild-type virus .
An increase in the level of E2F-4 protein was prevented by UV inactivation of the virus , but the reduction in amount of the slower-migrating forms of E2F-4 was only partly affected by the UV treatment of the virus , indicating that part of that change in E2F-4 might be in response to the signal transduction occurring when virus binds to the B cell ( Fig .
4A ) .
As shown previously for cyclin D2 ( 72 ) , the induction of E2F-4 expression also occurred at the RNA level ( Fig .
4B ) , at a time consistent with its being a consequence of EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP expression from the EBV genome .
Regulation of apoptosis during EBV infection is another important aspect of the transition from the resting state to immortalized LCL .
There are likely to be changing apoptotic signals during the process of infection , since there is induction of cell proteins that are able to cause apoptosis , such as E2F-1 ( Fig .
2 ) and c-Myc ( 1 ) , as growth is activated .
BCL-2 ( perhaps induced by LMP-1 ) has already been implicated in the control of apoptosis in LCLs and group III BL cells ( 27 , 28 ) , but the involvement of other pathways has been suggested ( 44 ) .
It is the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins that is impor-tant , so we examined the levels of several proteins that regulate apoptosis in LCLs .
To provide a framework in which the relationship between the EBV gene expression in EBV-immortalized LCLs and sensitivity to apoptosis might be interpreted , the protein levels in LCLs were compared to those in other B-cell lines with and without EBV gene expression .
The most suitable lines for comparison were BL cells , since there are examples of these cell lines both containing and lacking EBV and there is also the opportunity to compare group I EBV-positive BL cells ( which express only EBNA-1 of the six viral proteins shown to be involved in LCL immortalization ) to group III EBV-positive BL cells , which have a pattern of EBV gene expression similar to that of the LCLs .
EBV-negative and group I EBV-positive BL cell lines are relatively sensitive to apoptosis induced by ionomycin , stimulation via cell surface Ig molecules , or serum deprivation compared to group III BL lines ( 8 , 27 , 28 , 31 , 81 ) .
Additionally , although both group III BL cell lines and LCL s express the Fas voL .

Primary B cells isolated by CD19 positive selection were stained with FITC-conjugated antibodies recognizing ( A ) CD20 or ( B ) CD23 and analyzed by flow cytometry .
An LCL immortalized with B95-8 EBV ( C ) was used as a positive control for CD23 staining .
The percentage of positive cells was determined by using linear gates set to include 1 % positive cells on unstained samples ( dotted lines ) .
( D ) Numbers of viable ( squares ) and dead ( circles ) cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion in uninfected ( open symbols ) and EBV-infected ( filled symbols ) cultures .
( E ) DNA synthesis was measured by [ *H } thymidine incorporation in uninfected ( open squares ) and EBV infected ( filled squares ) cells .
Uninfected ( F and H ) and EBV-infected ( G and I ) cells containing less than 2 N DNA and those in G ; , S , and G ; /M phases of the cell cycle were analyzed by propidium iodide staining at 12 ( F and G ) and 72 ( H an I ) h after the addition of virus .
receptor , only LCL s are sensitive to ligation of the Fas receptor ( 21 ) .
However , this study measured DNA synthesis and did not directly examine effects of Fas on apoptosis .
To confirm that decreased DNA synthesis in Fas-treated LCLs was due to induction of apoptosis , we treated Fas receptor-positive group III BL cell lines and LCLs with an agonistic Fas antibody .
Consistent with earlier results ( 21 ) , anti-Fas induced cell death in LCLs but not in group III BL cell lines ( Fig .
5A ) , and analysis of genomic DNA demonstrated DNA degradation characteristic of apoptosis ( Fig .
5B ) .

Purified B cells positively selected from peripheral blood were infected with EBV or treated with PMA ( 30 ng/m ! )
in a time course , and aliquots were assayed by Western blotting for the proteins indicated .
Purified B cells negatively selected from tonsils ( N ) were also compared with the positively selected B cells from peripheral blood ( P ) for p130 expression ( lower right panel ) .
To relate these differences in apoptosis sensitivity to the endogenous levels of apoptosis-regulatory molecules , we examined expression of BCL-2 , BAX , BCL-XL , BAK , MCL-1 , and BAG-1 isoforms by immunoblotting ( Fig .
6A ) , and the results are summarized in Fig .
6C .
Expression of the antiapoptotic A20 gene was measured by Northern blotting ( Fig .
6B ) and compared to the protein data ( Fig .
6C ) .
Reactivity with the P-19 antibody was also determined in the cell lines ( Fig .
6A ) ( see below ) .
Consistent with previous data ( 27 , 28 ) , expression of BCL-2 was higher in LCLs and group III BL cell lines than in EBV-negative and group I BL cell lines .
The sizes of the proteins on the Western blots indicated that BAX was entirely the a form , with no evidence of B , y , or 8 splicing , and BCL-X was entirely the L form , with no evidence of BCL-X4 .
We have recently clarified the nature of the two BAG-1 isoforms ( 53 ) and shown that the absence of BAX protein in DG75 cells is due to a frameshift mutation in the BAX gene ( 9 ) .
Of the other genes assayed which can contribute to the overall threshold of apoptosis , only the A20 gene showed a correlation with the resistance to apoptosis induced by low serum characteristic of LCLs : in this panel of cell lines , it correlated almost as well as BCL-2 expression .
However , neither the endogenous A20 nor BCL-2 expressed in LCLs is sufficient to make the EBV-immortalized LCL s resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis ( Fig .
6 ) , in contrast to the group III BL lines , which have EBV gene expression similar to that of LCL s but are relatively resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis .
The promoter for the A20 gene can be regulated through two adjacent NF- « B sites 45 to 66 bp upstream of the transcription start ( 38 ) , so it seemed likely that this transcription factor ( which can be induced by LMP would be what determines A20 expression in LCLs .
Recent work indicates that during the time course of early EBV infection there is a very early induction of NF-kB followed by a later , larger induction , presumably caused by the LMP protein .
The early transient induction of NF-kB correlated with the signal transduction activated by the binding of EBV to its receptor on the cell , CD21 ( 75 ) .
We analyzed the time course of expression of different components of the NF- « B complex and its inhibitory I- < B proteins during EBV infection ( Fig .
7 ) .
LMP-1 continued to accumulate even up to 144 h after infection , but the p65 , p50 , p52 , c-Rel , Rel-B , and Ix-Ba proteins were all induced to their steady-state levels by 48 h after infection .

Ix-BB was higher in the uninfected cells than in the EBV-infected cells but also achieved a steady-state level by 48 h after infection .
LMP-1 expression in our system is usually detected at 48 to 72 h , so the components of the NF-kB factor were therefore all present at their steady-state levels by the time LMP was expressed .
Since exists as an inactive complex with in the cytoplasm , awaiting activation in response to signal transduc-tion , we wished to compare the time course of induction of the LMP protein and the level of activated NF-kB .
The level of activated NF- « xB was determined by gel retardation assays of an oligonucleotide containing a consensus NF-kB binding site .
The specificity of the assay was established by using nuclear extracts of LCL3 cells ( Fig .
8A ) ; the broad band of retarded kB complexes was dependent on the addition of cell extract and was competed by an oligonucleotide containing a xB site but not by an unrelated control oligonucleotide .
Further evidence for specificity was provided by supershifting the complexes with antibodies to components of the NF- « B factor .
The faster-migrating part of the complex was supershifted by an antibody to p50 , the slower-migrating part of the complex was supershifted by an antibody to p65 , and the level of the whole complex was reduced by an antibody to p52 .
Antibodies to RelB and cRel did not appear to affect the complexes , and major components of the two complexes may be p50-p50 and p50-p65 .
This assay was then applied to the time course of EBV infection by using nuclear extracts from purified B cells at various times after infection .
The level of activated NF-kB ( Fig .
8C ) and the level of LMP-1 ( Fig .
8B ) correlated in time , consistent with LMP-1 being responsible for the major increase in activated NF-kB observed during primary infection .
The NF-KB site in the oligonucleotide used for the determination of activated NF-kB in the gel retardation assay was identical to the NF- « B site in the A20 promoter 57 to 66 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start in the published A20 sequence ( 38 ) .

DISCUSSION We have assayed many proteins involved in regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis during EBV infection .
The most straightforward interpretation of our data is that the changes represent the consequences of EBV infection leading to cell proliferation , but it is important to appreciate that there is a heterogeneity of response at the cellular level to the addition of virus to the B lymphocytes .
Characterization of the cells showed a high degree of homogeneity .
For example , the cells were selected with the B-cell marker CD19 and then also verified to be 96 % positive for the B-cell marker CD20 ; they were a resting population , as shown by the lack of dine incorporation and lack of CD23 activation marker .

( A ) Expression of BCL-2 family proteins in BL cell lines and LCLs .
Lysates were prepared from the indicated cell lines , and equal amounts of protein were analyzed for expression of BCL-2 family proteins by immunoblot-ting .
The position of migration of each protein is indicated .
N20 data for BAX expression in these cell lines is shown in reference 9 .
( B ) Analysis of A20 RNA expression in BL cell lines and LCLs .
Cytoplasmic RNA isolated from the indicated cell lines was analyzed by Northern blotting with the A20 cDNA as a probe .
Equal loading of the gel tracks was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of the rRNA bands on the gel before transfer ( data not shown ) .
( C ) Summary of BCL-2 family protein expression and A20 RNA expression in the panel of cell lines studied in this paper .
Lines marked ND were not tested for the indicated protein or RNA .
A20 expression was determined by Northern blotting , except for Raji , IB4 , and BL36LCL , which were assayed by RNase protection .
Group III BL cell lines and LCLs are resistant to apoptosis induced by cross-linking surface immunoglobulin , ionomycin , and serum depletion relative to group I and EBV-negative BL cell lines .
In addition , LCLs are sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis , whereas group III BL cell lines are resistant .
Group I BL cell lines and EBV-negative BL lines do not express Fas and are therefore resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis .
possible that there is further heterogeneity in the B-cell preparation with consequent heterogeneity of response to the virus , but there is no evidence for this .
Under the conditions used , about 27 % of the cells became positive for EBNA-LP expression by immunofluorescence .
We are not able to track individual cells through the long time course of immortalization , so we can not tell at this stage which of the cells will eventually grow out .
Over the first 72 h of infection , when most of the changes occur , there is relatively little cell death and negligible proliferation , so the changes are not likely to be accounted for voL .

Purified B cells positively selected from peripheral blood were infected with EBV in a time course ( hours post infection ) , and aliquots were assayed by Western blotting for the proteins indicated .
+ , present ; - , absent ; x , empty lane .
by population effects involving subgroups of cells containing the individual marker proteins ; but since we have not yet followed the proteins studied here by Western blotting by immunofluorescence ( most of the antibodies used are not suitable for immunofluorescence studies ) , it has not been possible to link the changes directly to expression of EBV proteins in individual cells .
It is also important to remember that the virus preparation is very likely to be heterogeneous , since there is no opportunity to plaque purify EBV ( there is no plaque assay ) and there is little knowledge of the infectivity per virus particle .
In spite of these reservations , the results we have described are highly consistent with the entry of the cells into the cell cycle and prevention of apoptosis as a consequence of virus infection .
Since EBV infects resting B cells , the cells must first enter the cell cycle .
It is clear that some activation of the resting cell occurs as a result of the binding of the gp350 surface glycoprotein on the virus particle to the receptor on the cell , CD21 ( 72 , 75 ) .
Signal transduction from this results in tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and some effects of the virus infection in the cell can be prevented with inhibitors of various protein kinases ( 71 ) .
A small , transient activation of NF- « B has also been demonstrated to result from virus binding ( 75 ) , and we have shown here that part of the reduction in mobility of E2F-4 occurs with UV-inactivated EBV , implying that viral gene expression is not necessary for this effect .
Other responses to EBV infection that we have measured in this study all required viral gene expression .
One of the most remarkable aspects of the data is that the changes in protein profiles are so clear and complete in the time course studied .
For example , p27 virtually disappears by 72 h after infection and there are major changes in the phosphorylation profiles of p130 and pRb which at first sight seem to be inconsistent with only about 27 % of the cells becoming positive for EBNA-LP , our early marker for virus infection .
Potential explanations for this include more than 27 % of the cells being infected ( perhaps there are large variations in the degree of immunofluorescence upon infection ) or activation of other cells by those that have achieved viral gene expression .
It is noticeable that the cells clump together after the addition of virus , giving the opportunity for cell-to-cell communication .
Alternatively , there might be soluble factors secreted as a consequence of early viral gene expression that can then cause changes in the uninfected cells .
We have also studied regulation of apoptosis in EBV-negative and -positive BL-derived cell lines and EBV-immortalized LCLs .
Phenotypically distinct BL cell lines and LCLs are dif-ferentially sensitive to induction of apoptosis by some agents .
EBV -negative and group I EBV-positive BL lines are relatively sensitive to ionomycin , stimulation via surface Ig molecules , or serum deprivation compared to group III BL cell lines ( 8 , 27 , 28 , 31 , 81 ) .
Additionally , although both group III BL lines and LCLs express the Fas receptor ( 21 ) , only LCLs are sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis ( EBV-negative and group I BL lines do not express Fas receptor and are therefore insensitive to Fas ligation ) .
Group III BL cells express high levels of BCL-2 , whereas group I and EBV-negative lines do not , and it has been concluded that this contributes to the resistance of group III BL lines to apoptosis induced by ionomycin , Ig , and serum withdrawal ( 27 , 28 ) .
However , control of apoptosis is thought to be determined by the relative levels of pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2-related proteins , and in those experiments the endogenous levels of other BCL-2 family proteins were not measured .
Indeed , BCL-2-independent events also play a role in resistance to apoptosis triggered by these agents in some BL lines ( 44 ) , and the resistance of group III BL lines to Fas-induced apoptosis relative to LCLs can not be determined by BCL-2 , since both these groups of lines express equivalent amounts of BCL-2 ( 18 , 28 ) .
This is also consistent with the inability of BCL-2 expression to suppress Fas-induced apoptosis in some systems ( 14 , 18 , 29 , 43 , 46 , 52 , 70 , 77 ) .
Some of the proteins known to be induced by EBV infection , such as E2F-1 and c-Myc , are able to induce apoptosis in some circumstances .
The time course of changes in the E2F-1 and E2F-4 proteins has been described in this paper , and our analysis of the expression and properties of Myc family proteins during EBV infection will be published elsewhere .

( A ) Establishment of specificity of gel retardation assay for NF- « B complexes with LCL3 cell extracts by competition with 100-fold excess of unlabelled NF-kB oligonucleotide or a control oligonucleotide of unrelated sequence .
NF- « B complexes ( arrows ) were also tested in supershift assays with antibodies to p50 , p52 , RelB , cRel , and p65 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibodies sc-114 , sc-848 , sc-226 , sc-70 , and sc-109 , respectively ) as indicated ( 1 mg per assay ) .
( B ) Purified B cells positively selected from peripheral blood were infected with EBV in a time course ( hours post infection ) , and aliquots were assayed by Western blotting for LMP-1 .
The LMP-1 signal was quantified by scanning the autoradiograph , and the results are plotted in arbitrary units .
( C ) Nuclear extracts were prepared from the same time course of infection as for panel B and used in a gel retardation assay for NF-kB performed as for panel A .
The active NF- « B , indicated by the amount of specifically shifted probe , was quantified by scanning the autoradiograph , and the results are plotted in arbitrary units .
a framework for investigation of the control of apoptosis in LCLs and during EBV infection , we studied the expression of the BCL-2 family of proteins and other pro- and antiapoptotic genes .
Expression of BCL-2 and A20 both correlated well with resistance to apoptosis .
Attention has previously focused on J. Virou .
BCL-2 in this context , but our results and several recent reports of effects of A20 in lymphoid and epithelial cells indicate that A20 is also likely to be important .
It is well established that the A20 gene can be activated by NF- « B through two adjacent NF- « B binding sites in the promoter ( 39 ) , and BCL-2 has also been reported to be induced by LMP-1 ( 28 ) .
NF-kB activity , measured by using a standard NF- « B site identical in sequence to one of those in the A20 promoter , showed an excellent temporal correlation between active , nuclear NF-kB and LMP-1 expression during infection , indicating that LMP is likely to be the major determinant of NF- « B activity in the LCL cells .
The Namalwa and BL74 cell lines , which were negative for A20 , have the group II pattern of EBV gene expression and do not express LMP-1 , although both expressed BCL-2 .
It was notable in the Western blots of BCL-2 family protein expression ( Fig .
6A ) that the pattern of expression of BAX detected with the N20 antibody was quite different from the protein expression detected with the P-19 antibody , which has also been described as detecting human BAX ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
The protein from some cell lines detected by P-19 also showed altered migration on the sodium dodecyl sulfate gel ( Fig .
6A ) .
We considered the possibility that the two antibodies might be detecting hitherto-unknown different forms of BAX in these cells or that the specificity of one of the antibodies ( probably P-19 ) was described incorrectly .
This is significant because a considerable amount of earlier work ( 2 , 42 , 63 , 74 ) has used P-19 to monitor human BAX protein levels .
Upon investigation ( Fig .
6A and data not shown ) , it became clear that the P-19 antibody cross-reacts in Western blotting experiments with another protein of a size similar to that of human BAX .
The authenticity of the N20 specificity for Bax was verified by showing that a third anti-BAX antibody ( 13666E ) ) gave the same pattern of reactivity as N20 in a panel of relevant cell lines and the Bax protein recognized in the cell extracts was the same size as the protein produced by transfection of a Bax cDNA ( data not shown ) .
It therefore seems that antibody P-19 does not recognize endogenous human Bax .
We have , however , repeated the experiments in the study in this laboratory that used P-19 ( 2 ) with the N20 antibody and confirmed the conclusions of the study ( data not shown ) .
The first two viral genes known to be expressed upon infection are EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 .
These two proteins have been shown to cooperate in the induction of the cyclin D2 RNA , which is an early marker of cell cycle entry that is induced after infection ( 72 ) .
Although EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP can activate transcription of various promoters , it is not yet clear whether the promoter for cyclin D2 is regulated directly by these pro-teins .
Deletion analysis of the cyclin D2 promoter , seeking elements that may control its response to serum growth factors , has revealed both positive and negative regulatory regions upstream of the transcription start ( 11 ) .
One of the consequences of activation of edk activity is phosphorylation of pocket proteins , which bind and regulate the EZF complex .
The E2F family of transcription factors are thought to be major determinants of cell cycle progression , and different E2F family members and complexes with various pocket proteins are characteristic of the resting and cycling cells ( 65 ) .
Thus , E2F-4-DP-1-p130 complexes are found in resting cells ( 45 , 73 ) , but the dominant G , E2F complex in cycling cells contains E2F-1 with DP-1 and Rb or p107 .
Clearly , changes in the E2F profile and changes in cyclins are both early events in the cell cycle entry caused by EBV infection .
Since only the RNA of cyclin D2 had been measured in previous experiments ( 72 ) and little study had been made of the EZ2F proteins ( 12 ) , it was unclear whether the earliest effects of EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP on the cell cycle entry process were likely to be mediated voL .
73 , 1999 through changing the balance of E2F complex proteins or through cyclin D2 .
In this study , in which we have analyzed the time course of changes to E2F factors , pocket proteins , cyclins , edks , and cdk inhibitors , the induction of cyclin D2 is the earliest event we have observed that is dependent on viral gene expression ( presumably of EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP ) .
Identification of the initial target genes in the cell for EBV immortalizing proteins will thus now focus on whether the cyclin D2 promoter can be activated directly by EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP or whether there may be other intermediate steps .
There is no consensus binding site for RBP-Jk in the first 1,000 nucleotides upstream of the reported transcription starts in the sequence of the cyclin D2 promoter ( 11 ) , but EBNA-2 is known to be able to activate transcription through other DNA binding proteins ; by analyzing the mechanism of induction of cyclin D2 RNA and screening for other genes that might be induced soon after infection , we hope to identify the direct cell targets that EBV modulates when it infects human B cells and , with such high efficiency , causes them to proliferate .
