The EMBO Journal vol.11 no.7 pp.2573-2581 , 1992 Transcription factor AP-2 activates gene expression of HTLV-I Christian Muchardt , Jacob-S.Seeler , Ajay Nirula , Shiaoching Gong and Richard Gaynor Division of Molecular Virology , Department of Internal Medicine , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas , Dallas , Texas , USA Communicated by P.Boulanger The HTLV-I LTR contains three conserved regulatory elements known as 21 base pair repeats which are required for stimulation of gene expression by the transactivator protein tax .
Mutagenesis indicates that the 21 bp repeats can be subdivided into three motifs , A , B and C , each of which influences the level of tax activation .
The A site in the 21 bp repeat has strong homology with previously described binding sites for the transcription factor AP-2 .
We demonstrated that AP-2 mRNA was present in T-lymphocytes and that cellular factors from both non-transformed and transformed T-lymphocytes specifically bound to the consensus motif for AP-2 in each 21 bp .
To determine the role of AP-2 in the regulation of the HTLV-I LTR gene expression , we used an AP-2 cDNA in DNA binding and transient expression assays .
Gel retardation and methylation interference studies revealed that bacterially produced AP-2 bound specifically and with high affinity to all three 21 bp repeats , and that it required the core sequence AGGC for specific binding .
Binding of AP-2 prevented the subsequent binding of members of the CREB/ATF family to an adjacent regulatory motif in the 21 bp repeat .
Transfection of an AP-2 expression construct into T-lymphocytes activated gene expression from the HTLV-I LTR .
At least two 21 bp repeats were required for high levels of AP-2 activation and mutagenesis of the AP-2 consensus binding sequences in the 21 bp repeats eliminate this activation .
These results demonstrate that AP-2 is capable of binding to and activating gene expression from the HTLV-I LTR , and thus may play a role in the pathogenesis of this important human retrovirus .
Key words : 21 bp repeat/ AP-2/HTLV-l/tax Introduction The human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( Poiesz et a/. , 1980 , 1981 ; Yoshida et al. , 1982 ) .
HTLV-I is also associated with a progressive demyelinating syndrome known as tropical spastic paraparesis ( Gessain er al. , 1985 ; Osame et al. , 1986 ) .
HTLV-I has been demonstrated to infect CD4* T-lymphocytes and to immortalize these cells .
A 40 kDa protein encoded by HTLV-I known as tax is involved in the transforming properties of this virus ( Hinrichs er al. , 1987 ; Wano € Oxford University Press et al. , 1988 ; Pozzati et al. , 1990 ; Tanaka et al. , 1990 ) .
In addition , tax is critical for the regulation of viral gene expression ( Sodroski er al. , 1984 ; Chen et al. , 1985 ; Felber et al. , 1985 ; Fujisawa et al. , 1985 ; Smith and Greene , 1990 ) .
The properties of tax which mediate both its transcriptional and transforming activities have been the subject of intense investigation .
At least two different elements in the HTLV-I LTR are critical for activation of gene expression .
One element with the repeated sequence CC ( A/T ) CC serves as the binding site for the ets family of transcription factors ( Bosselut et al. , 1990 ; Gitlin et al. , 1991 ) .
Both ets-1 and ets-2 have been shown to be capable of activating gene expression of the HTLV-I LTR CAT constructs in cotransfection experiments ( Bosselut et al .
, 1990 ) .
The second element which is critical for gene expression of the HTLV LTR is the 21 bp repeat ( Fujisawa er al. , 1986 ; Paskalis et al. , 1986 ; Shimotohno et al. , 1986 ; Brady et al. , 1987 ; Rosen et al. , 1987 ) .
Three of these highly conserved repeats are present in different portions of the HTLV-I LTR and mutagenesis studies indicate that at least two 21 bp repeats are required for a high level of induction by tax ( Fujisawa et al .
, 1986 ; Brady et al. , 1987 ) .
Thus , the 21 bp repeat and potentially other elements in the HTLV-I LTR are critical for tax activation .
Mutagenesis of the 21 bp repeat indicates that it can be subdivided into three distinct motifs known as A , B and C ( Fujisawa et al .
, 1989 ; Montagne et al .
, 1990 ) .
The B motif contains the core sequence TGAGG which serves as a potential binding site for members of the ATF/CREB family ( Hai ert al. , 1989 ; Yoshimura et al. , 1990 ) .
The A and C motifs which flank the B motif contain the core recognition sequences AGGC and CCCC respectively .
Mutagenesis of the B motif eliminates tax activation ( Fujisawa et al. , 1989 ; Montagne et al. , 1990 ) , while mutagenesis of both the A and C motifs also result in severe decreases in tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR ( Montagne ert al. , 1990 ) .
Thus , the 21 bp repeats are composed of different motifs each of which may be required for complete activation by the tax protein .
Since tax does not directly bind to the HTLV-I LTR , its role in increasing gene expression is thought to be mediated by interaction with cellular factors bound to the LTR ( Marriot et al. , 1990 ; Béraud et al. , 1991 ) .
A number of different cellular factors can bind to the 21 bp repeats ( Altman et al. , 1988 ; Jeang et al. , 1988 ; Nyborg et al. , 1988 , 1990 ; Tan er al. , 1989a ; Montagne et al. , 1990 ; Nyborg and Dynan , 1990 ; Yoshimura et al .
, 1990 ; Béraud et al. , 1991 ) .
At least eight members of the CREB/ATF family can bind to the core sequence TGACG found in the B motif in the HTLV-I LTR ( Hai et al. , 1989 ; Tsujimoto et al. , 1990 ; Yoshimura et al. , 1990 ) .
Fractionation of cellular extracts and DNase I footprinting reveals that AP-2 or related factors bind over a portion of the 21 bp repeat , though which nucleotides are critical for this binding remain 2573 C.Muchardt et af .
unclear ( Nyborg and Dynan , 1990 ) .
In addition , other less well defined factors have also been demonstrated to bind to different motifs in the 21 bp repeat ( Tan et al. , 1989 ; Montagne er al. , 1990 ; Nyborg and Dynan , 1990 ; Yoshimura et al .
, 1990 ; Béraud et al. , 1991 ) .
In this study we explore the binding and regulation of AP-2 ( Williams et al. , 1988 ; Williams and Tjian , 1991a and b ) to the HTLV-I LTR .
We demonstrate that AP-2 mRNA is expressed in T-lymphocytes and that proteins from both T-lymphocytes and HeLa cells bind specifically and with high affinity to the AGGC sequence within the A motif of the HTLV-I LTR 21 bp repeat .
Likewise , proteins produced in bacteria from an AP-2 cDNA also binds to this motif and the binding of AP-2 to the A motif in the 21 bp repeat excludes the subsequent binding of members of the CREB/ATF family .
Finally , we demonstrate that AP-2 can activate gene expression from the HTLV-I LTR .
These studies describe the role of the cellular transcription factor AP-2 in the regulation of HTLV-I LTR gene expression .
Results HTLV-I LTR 21 bp repeats contain sequences with homology to AP-2 binding sites A schematic diagram of the position of the three 21 bp repeats in the HTLV-I LTR relative to the transcriptional start site and the nucleotide sequence of each of the three 21 bp repeats are shown in Figure 1A .
Binding assays and transfection experiments with mutagenized 21 bp repeat constructs were consistent with the fact that the 21 bp repeat can be further subdivided into three regulatory motifs known as A , B and C , each of which have distinct regulatory properties ( Figure 1A ) ( Fujisawa et al. , 1989 ; Montagne et al. , 1990 ) .
Examination of the DNA sequences in the A motif of the 21 bp repeats revealed strong homology to the binding site for the cellular transcription factor AP-2 which has previously been defined in the SV40 and metallothionein enhancers ( Figure 1B ) ( Mitchell et al. , 1987 ; Imagawa et al. , 1987 ) .
The highest degree of homology with SV40 was found in 21 bp repeat III , with a lower degree of homology found in repeats I and II .
The sequence AGGC was completely conserved in the A motif of all three 21 bp repeats .
AP-2 is present in T-lymphocytes Since HTLV-I can infect and transform T-lymphocytes , we first determined whether AP-2 mRNA was expressed in these cells .
Primers were synthesized to regions of the published AP-2 cDNA sequence ( Williams et al. , 1988 ) and used in polymerase chain reaction with total RNA isolated from the Jurkat T-lymphocyte cell line .
As shown in Figure 2 , four products were synthesized in the PCR reaction .
These products were all cloned and analyzed by DNA sequencing .
The 560 bp product had a sequence identical to the published AP-2 cDNA sequence ( Williams et al. , 1988 ) .
A smaller product of ~290 bp ( II ) appeared to be an alternatively spliced product of AP-2 mRNA which introduced a stop codon prematurely into the AP-2 coding sequence ( Figure 2 ) .
Two other products of 170 and 90 bp could not be related to the AP-2 cDNA sequence and were probably PCR artifacts ( Figure 2 ) .
A similar pattern of PCR products was seen in HUT78 cells ( data not shown ) .
Next we determined whether factors present in either Jurkat cells or an HTLV-I transformed T-lymphocyte cell line , SLB ( Koeffler et al. , 1984 ) , bound to an AP-2 binding site .
Labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to a high affinity AP-2 binding site in the human metallothionein promoter ( Imagawa et al .
, 1987 ) were used in gel retardation analysis with protein obtained from an in vitro translated AP-2 cDNA and nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat , SLB and HeLa cells .
A gel retarded species was seen in Jurkat , SLB and HeLa extracts ( Figure 3A , lanes 3-5 ) that comigrated closely with a species denoted by I obtained from the in vitro translated AP-2 cDNA which was not detected in unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate ( Figure 3A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
UV crosslinking revealed that the species detected in HeLa , SLB or Jurkat cell lines has a mol .
wt of 50 kDa which is close to the predicted mol .
wt of AP-2 ( data not shown ) .
To demonstrate the specificity of this binding , SLB extract was used in a competition experiment with oligonucleotides corresponding to either a wild-type 21 bp repeat or a 21 bp repeat mutated in the A site .
The slow mobility species found in SLB extract that comigrated with in vitro translated AP-2 ( Figure 3B , lane 1 ) was completely competed with oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type 21 bp III ( Figure 3B , lanes 2-4 ) but not with oligonucleotides lacking these sites ( Figure 3B , lanes 5-7 ) .
These results suggested that both AP-2 RNA and protein was presented in T-lymphocytes .

2574 AP-2 binds specifically to the HTLV-I 21 bp repeat A motif Our studies suggested that AP-2 bound to the A motif in the HTLV-I LTR 21 bp repeat .
To elucidate further the role of AP-2 in regulating HTLV-I gene expression , a cDNA encoding the complete AP-2 protein isolated from a HeLa cell AZAP cDNA library ( Williams et al. , 1988 ; Williams and Tjian , 1991a , b ) was cloned downstream of the glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) gene in the plasmid pGEX-2T ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) .
This clone made it possible to obtain high level expression of this gene product in Escherichia coli .
Following affinity purification of this AP-2 fusion protein by glutathione -Sepharose chromatography , both the GST/AP-2 fusion and native AP-2 protein obtained following cleavage of the fusion protein by thrombin were used in gel retardation assays with oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the three HTLV-I 21 bp repeats .
The gel retardation results were similar using both authentic AP-2 and the GST/AP-2 fusion protein ( data not shown ) .
AP-2 activation of HTLV-I Only the results with the GST/AP-2 fusions referred to hereafter as AP-2 are shown .
AP-2 ( Figure 4 , lanes 2 , 4 and 6 ) but not control bacterial extract containing the glutathione-S-transferase protein alone ( Figure 4 , lanes 1 , 3 and 5 ) was capable of binding to each of the 21 bp repeats .
The binding of AP-2 was stronger to 21 bp repeat III ( Figure 4 , lane 6 ) than for 21 bp repeats I and II ( Figure 4 , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The 21 bp repeat III has the strongest homology to the SV40 and the metallothionein AP-2 binding sites ( Figure 1 ) .
To determine the specificity of AP-2 binding , gel retardation with oligonucleotides corresponding to 21 bp repeat III was performed as was competition with both wild-type and mutated unlabeled oligonucleotides ( Figure 5 ) .
Oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type 21 bp repeat competed AP-2 binding ( Figure 5 , lane 3 ) as did oligonucleotides containing mutations of either the B or C sites ( Figure 5 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
However , oligonucleotides containing mutations of the A site either alone ( Figure 5 , Fig .

AP-2 binds to each of the three HTLV-I 21 bp repeats .
Oligonucleotides corresponding to HTLV-I 21 bp repeats I ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , II ( lanes 3 and 4 ) and III ( lanes 5 and 6 ) were used in gel retardation analysis with bacterial extract containing either glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) alone ( lanes 1 , 3 and 5 ) or GST/AP-2 fusion protein ( lanes 2 , 4 and 6 ) .
lane 4 ) or in combination with mutations of either or both of the B and C sites ( Figure 5 , lanes 7 and 8 ) did not result in significant competition for AP-2 binding .
These results indicate that AP-2 binds specifically to the A site within the 21 bp repeat III .
Similar results were seen with 21 bp repeats I and II ( data not shown ) .
Next we determined the specific contact points within the 21 bp repeat required for AP-2 binding .
Methylation interference studies were performed using partially methylated oligonucleotides corresponding to either the coding or non-coding strands of the 21 bp repeat III .
Following gel retardation analysis with AP-2 , the gel retarded species was removed , purified , cleaved with piperidine and electrophoresed , and autoradiography was performed .
Methylation of the non-coding strand of the 21 bp repeat revealed that four G residues in the A domain and upstream region were protected ( Figure 6A ) , while on the coding strand two G residues in the A domain were protected ( Figure 6B ) .
Free probe cleaved with piperidine gave a uniform cleavage of G residues ( data not shown ) .
There was no specific interference to other portions of the 21 bp repeat .
These results indicated that AP-2 bound specifically to the A motif in the 21 bp repeats with a strong requirement for the core sequences AGGC found in this motif .
Comparison of AP-2 binding to the HTLV-I 21 bp repeat and metallothionein enhancer We next wished to determine the binding affinity of AP-2 protein to 21 bp repeat III relative to that seen with the consensus in the AP-2 binding site in the metallothionein promoter .
Gel retardation analysis was performed with labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to 21 bp repeat III and either GST ( Figure 7 , lane 1 ) or bacterially produced AP-2 ( Figure 7 , lanes 2 and 8 ) .
Competition analysis was 2576 Fig .

Bacterially produced GST/AP-2 was used in gel regardation assays with oligonucleotides corresponding to the 21 bp III repeat .

performed with unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to either the 21 bp repeat III ( Figure 7 , lanes 3-7 ) or the metallothionein AP-2 motif ( Figure 7 , lanes 9-13 ) .
The competition analysis with the unlabeled 21 bp repeat oligonucleotides demonstrated that 75 % inhibition of AP-2 binding occurred at a 15-fold molar excess of cold competitor .
Competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the metallothionein AP-2 binding site demonstrated that 75 % inhibition of AP-2 binding was seen with a 3-fold molar excess of cold competitor .
These results demonstrated that the binding affinity of AP-2 to 21 bp repeat III was less than but in a range similar to that seen to the metallothionein AP-2 binding site .
AP-2 excludes the binding of a member of the CREB/ATF family to the 21 bp repeat Within an HTLV-I 21 bp repeat , different cellular factors probably bind to each of the three defined motifs .
Therefore it was important to determine whether multiple proteins may bind simultaneously to these different motifs within the 21 bp repeat .
We investigated whether AP-2 binding to the A motif could prevent members of the ATF/CREB family such as CREB ( Hoeffler et al. , 1988 ) and CRE-BPI1 ( Maekawa et al. , 1989 ) from binding to the B motif .
Gel retardation studies were performed with either uncleaved or a thrombin AP-2 activation of HTLV-I Fig .

Methylation interference of AP-2 binding to the 21 bp repeat .

The positions of the G residues in the 21 bp repeat which serve as contacts with AP-2 are indicated by straight lines .
cleaved truncated AP-2 fusion protein designated GST/AAP-2 and GST/CRE-BP1 .
Only the results with the fusion proteins were shown .
This truncated form of AP-2 which had binding and dimerization properties that were identical to those of native AP-2 ( Williams and Tjian , 1992a , b ) was used in gel retardation analysis to separate better the AP2 and CRE-BPI1 species .
The amount of labeled probe used in the gel retardation resulted in 80-90 % saturation so that formation of DNA-protein complexes composed of both AP-2 and CRE-BPI would be favored .
Gel retardation demonstrated that AAP-2 and CRE-BPI1 were each capable of binding to oligonucleotides corresponding to 21 bp repeat III ( Figure 8 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
When equimolar amounts of both proteins were added simultaneously to the labeled oligonucleotides , both AAP-2 and CRE-BPI bound individually to the oligonucleotides ( Figure 8 , lane 4 ) .
No slower mobility species that would indicate the binding of both proteins to the same probe was detected .
Thus , both AP-2 and CRE-BP1 could exclude the binding of the other protein to the 21 bp repeat .
Mutant 21 bp repeat III oligonucleotides in either the B motif ( Figure 8 , lanes 5-8 ) or the A motif ( Figure 8 , lanes 9-12 ) were also used in gel retardation analysis .
Mutations in the B motif did not alter AAP-2 binding to the 21 bp repeat ( Figure 8 , lanes 3 , 6 and 8 ) but completely inhibited the binding of CRE-BPI ( Figure 8 , lane 7 ) .
Likewise , mutations of the A motif eliminated AAP-2 binding to the 21 bp repeat ( Figure 8 , lane 10 ) but did not affect CRE-BP 1 binding ( Figure 8 , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
These results indicated that AP-2 and CRE-BPI1 bound indepen- Fig .

For competition analysis , increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to HTLV-I 21 bp repeat III ( lanes 3-7 ) or the metallothionein AP-2-binding site ( lanes 9-13 ) in either a 10-fold ( lanes 3 and 9 ) , 20-fold ( lanes 4 and 10 ) , 50-fold ( lanes 5 and 11 ) , 100-fold ( lanes 6 and 12 ) or 200-fold ( lanes 7 and 13 ) molar excess were used .

Labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to either 21 bp repeat III ( lanes 1-4 ) , 21 bp III with a mutated B site ( lanes 5-8 ) or 21 bp repeat III with a mutated A site ( lanes 9-12 ) were used in gel retardation analysis with GST alone ( lanes 1 , 5 and 9 ) , in the presence of a truncated GST/AAP-2 protein ( lanes 2 , 6 and 10 ) , in the presence of GST/CRE-BPI ( lanes 3 , 7 and 11 ) or in the presence of both GST/CRE-BP1 and truncated GST/AP-2 proteins ( lanes 4 , 8 and 12 ) .
The position of mutations in either the A or B motifs of the 21 bp repeats is also indicated .
AP-2 activates gene expression from the HTLV-I LTR Since we demonstrated that AP-2 bound specifically to each of the HTLV-I 21 bp repeats , we next determined the role of this transcription factor in regulating HTLV-I gene expression in T-lymphocytes .
Each transfection was repeated three times with similar results .
Transfection of an AP-2 expression vector and an HTLV-I LTR CAT construct into unstimulated Jurkat cells resulted in a 2- to 3-fold stimulation of HTLV-I gene expression ( Figure 9 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Cotransfection of tax with the HTLV-I LTR CAT construct into unstimulated Jurkat cells resulted in a 6- to 8-fold stimulation of gene expression ( Figure 9A , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Mutation of the A sites in each of the three 21 bp repeats in the HTLV-I CAT construct eliminated activation by AP-2 and resulted in only slight stimulation by tax .
These results suggested that AP-2 weakly stimulated gene expression of the HTLV-I LTR in unstimulated Jurkat cells .
Mutation of the A site decreased both AP-2 and tax activation of the HTLV-I LTR .
Similar transfections were performed with PHA , ionomycin and PMA -stimulated Jurkat cells .
AP-2 activated the HTLV-I LTR CAT gene expression 4- to 5-fold in stimulated Jurkat cells ( Figure 9B , lane 2 ) while tax resulted in a 20-fold stimulation of this construct ( Figure 9B , lane 3 ) .
Mutations of each A site in the HTLV-I LTR eliminated AP-2 activation and decreased tax activation to 3-fold ( Figure 9B , Lanes 4-6 ) .
Four- to S-fold activation of HTLV-I gene expression by AP-2 was also seen when these constructs were transfected into HUT78 ( Figure 9C ) and SLB cells 2578 Fig .

AP-2 activates the HTLV-I LTR .
A wild-type HTLV LTR-I CAT construct ( lanes 1-3 ) or a similar construct mutated in the A site of all three 21 bp repeats ( lanes 4-6 ) were cotransfected into either nonstimulated ( A ) or TPA , PHA and ionomycin stimulated Jurkat cells ( B ) with either expression vector alone ( lanes 1 and 4 ) , 1 ug of an AP-2 expression construct ( lanes 2 and 5 ) or 2.5 ug of a tax expression construct ( lanes 3 and 6 ) .
( C ) HUT78 cells were transfected with either wild-type ( lanes 1-4 ) or mutated ( lanes 5-8 ) HTLV-I constructs .
Lanes 1 and 4 contain no AP-2 expression vector , lanes 2 and 5 contain 1 4g of this expression vector , lanes 3 and 6 contain 3 ug and lanes 4 and 8 contain 2.5 ag of a tax expression vector .
The percent CAT conversion for each sample was calculated .
( data not shown ) .
These results suggested that both AP-2 and tax were capable of significant activation of HTLV-I gene expression in T-lymphocytes .
Next we defined the number of 21 bp repeats required for activation by AP-2 and tax .
A schematic of the constructs used in these studies is shown in Figure 10 .
All transfections were performed in four independent experiments on both Jurkat and HepG2 cells , a cell line which has been demonstrated to contain non-detectable levels of AP-2 ( Williams eral. , 1988 ) .
The result obtained for each construct is given in fold activation .
Significant activation of the HTLV-I LTR by AP-2 expression vectors required at least two 21 bp repeats ( Figure 10 , lines 2 and 3 ) .
HTLV-I CAT constructs containing either 21 bp repeats II and III or I and II gave levels of gene expression with AP-2 that were slightly decreased as compared with that seen with all three 21 bp repeats ( Figure 10 , lines 1-3 ) .

Activation of HTLV-I mutants by AP-2 and tax .
A variety of truncated HTLV-I LTR constructs were cotransfected into Hep G2 cells with either an AP-2 expression vector ( 1 ug ) , a tax expression vector ( 2.5 ug ) or in the absence of these factors .
The final concentration of expression vector in each transfection was kept constant at 10 ug by adding RSV -globin .
The results are the summary of four independent experiments and the results are expressed in fold of activation of each construct by AP-2 and tax .
constructs were also strongly activated by tax , as previously reported by Fujisawa ert al .
( 1986 ) .
Constructs containing only one of the 21 bp repeats were not significantly activated by AP-2 ( Figure 10 , lines 4-7 ) .
These constructs were also poorly activated by tax except for one construct which contained 21 bp repeat III and an element which binds both the ets ( Bosselut et al. , 1990 ; Gitlin et al. , 1991 ) and SPI ( Nyborg et al. , 1990 ) proteins ( Figure 10 , line 4 ) .
Discussion Multiple regions in the HTLV-I LTR are critical for modulating gene expression ( Fujisawa et al. , 1986 , 1989 ; Paskalis et al. , 1986 ; Shimotohno et al .
, 1986 ; Brady et al. , 1987 ; Rosen et al. , 1987 ; Bosselut et al. , 1990 ; Montagne et al. , 1990 ) .
These regulatory regions serve as the binding sites for a variety of cellular proteins ( Altman er al. , 1988 ; Jeang et al. , 1988 ; Nyborg et al. , 1988 , 1990 ; Tan et al. , 1989 ; Bosselut er al. , 1990 ; Montagne et al. , 1990 ; Nyborg and Dynan , 1990 ; Yoshimura et al. , 1990 ; Béraud et al. , 1991 ) .
The transactivator protein , tax , is also required for high levels of HTLV-I gene expression ( Sodroski et al. , 1984 ; Chen et al. , 1985 ; Felber et al. , 1985 ; Fujisawa et al. , 1985 ; Smith and Greene , 1990 ) .
In this study , we investigate the role of the transcription factor AP-2 on the regulation of HTLV-I gene expression .
Fractionation of cellular extracts reveals that multiple factors can bind to the 21 bp repeat ( Altman ert al. , 1988 ; Jeang et al. , 1988 ; Nyborg et al. , 1988 , 1990 ; Tan et al. , 1989 ; Bosselut et al. , 1990 ; Montagne et al. , 1990 ; Nyborg and Dynan , 1990 ; Yoshimura et al. , 1990 ) .
These factors appear in some instances to have cell-type specificity though most factors have not been completely characterized ( Nyborg and Dynan , 1990 ) .
One study reports that oligonucleotide affinity column purified AP-2 from HeLa cells binds to a region of the HTLV-I LTR which overlaps each of the 21 bp repeats , but AP-2 was not detected in SLB cells using DNase I footprinting assays ( Nyborg and Dynan , 1990 ) .
However , we detected AP-2 RNA and binding activity in several T-lymphocyte cell lines using PCR and gel retardation assays .
The level of AP-2 RNA and protein in HeLa cells is also relatively low since AP-2 expression vectors activate constructs with AP-2 binding sites in transfection assays performed in HeLa cells ( Williams et al. , 1988 ) .
Other studies , using Agt11 expression cloning with oligonucleotides similar to those found in the B motif , demonstrate that multiple members of the CREB/ATF family bind to this region ( Hai et al .
, 1989 ; Tsujimoto et al. , 1991 ; Yoshimura et al. , 1990 ) .
Which if any of these factors is/are responsible for tax activation has not yet been demonstrated .
In addition , constructs containing isolated CREB/ATF sites are not inducible by tax , suggesting that either the position of these 2579 C.Muchardt et af .
sites in a specific promoter or proteins binding to overlapping motifs are critical for tax activation ( Montagne et al .
, 1990 ) .
The fact that both the A and C sites in the 21 bp repeat are critical for tax activation suggests that multiple factors may be required for tax activation .
Since the A motif in the 21 bp repeat has strong homology with AP-2 binding sites found in the SV40 and metallothionein promoters , we wished to determine whether AP-2 could bind and activate gene expression from the HTLV-I LTR 21 bp repeats .
AP-2 RNA is expressed in T-lymphocytes and a cellular protein of similar molecular weight and mobility to AP-2 binds to the A motif in the 21 bp repeat .
To investigate AP-2 binding to the HTLV-I LTR further , we demonstrate that protein expressed from an AP-2 cDNA binds specifically and with high affinity to the A motif in the 21 bp repeat .
The binding of AP-2 to the 21 bp repeat excludes the binding of a member of the ATF/CREB family , CRE-BP1 ( Maekawa et al. , 1989 ) , to an adjacent binding site in the B motif .
Finally , we demonstrate that AP-2 can activate expression of the HTLV-I LTR gene in both T-lymphocytes and other cell lines .
Thus AP-2 may be important in regulating HTLV-I gene expression during infection of both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells ( Clapham et al. , 1983 ) .
AP-2 binds and activates gene expression from other viral promoters , including SV40 ( Mitchell et al. , 1987 ; Williams et al. , 1988 ) and hepatitis B ( Seto et al. , 1990 ) .
Within different viral and cellular promoters there appears to be marked degeneracy of the AP-2 consensus binding sequences .
The binding domain of AP-2 has no detectable homology with other well described DNA binding proteins .
In addition , AP-2 contains a carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain and an amino-terminal proline-rich activating domain ( Williams and Tjian , 1991a , b ) .
UV crosslinking experiments indicate that AP-2 binds to the HTLV-I LTR as a dimer , in agreement with its binding to other promoters ( data not shown , Williams and Tjian , 1991a , b ) .
The finding that AP-2 excludes binding of members of the CREB/ATF family to the B motif suggests that different factors may compete for the binding to the 21 bp repeat resulting in different patterns of gene expression .
Since the activity of AP-2 is regulated by both phorbol esters and cyclic AMP ( Imagawa et al. , 1987 ; Luscher et al. , 1989 ) , AP-2 may mediate expression of HTLV-I by various stimuli which affect the signal transduction pathway ( Poteat et al. , 1989 ; Tan et al. , 1989b ) .
Thus , HTLV-I gene expression may be regulated by cellular factors such as the recently described HEBI1 ( Béraud eral. , 1991 ) which potentially activate gene expression in a tax-dependent manner , in addition to other factors which function independent of tax .
The role of tax in modulating AP-2 activation of HTLV-I gene expression is not addressed in this study .
However , experiments suggest that tax inhibits AP-2 activation of HTLV-I gene expression by direct interaction of tax with AP-2 .
This situation is similar to the interaction of SV40 T antigen with AP-2 which results in inhibition of SV40 gene expression .
In addition , tax has also been demonstrated to regulate negatively DNA polymerase B which contains potential AP-2 binding sites ( Mitchell er al. , 1987 ; Jeang et al. , 1990 ) .
Thus , one possible mechanism of tax regulation may be to inhibit the binding of one group of cellular transcription factors and allow the binding of different factors which may result in altered patterns of gene expression .
Further studies will be required to define the role of AP-2 2580 in activating HTLV-I gene expression in both the presence and absence of tax and its role in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I infection .
Materials and methods Plasmid constructs A HeLa cDNA library cloned into AZAP was screened with 3Omer oligonucleotides corresponding to both the amino- and carboxyl-termini of the AP-2 coding sequences .
An AP-2 cDNA spanning the entire AP-2 coding region extending from nt 8 to 1621 was isolated ( Williams er a/. , 1988 ) .
This cDNA was cloned in pGEM2 , downstream of an SP6 promoter for in vitro expression .
A BamHI site was inserted into the amino-terminus of AP-2 and a BamHI-EcoRI fragment from this construct was cloned into pGEX-2T ( Pharmacia ) for bacterial expression ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) .
A truncation of AP-2 spanning amino acids 165-437 was also cloned into the Smal and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T for bacterial expression .
A cDNA containing the complete coding sequence of CRE-BPI ( Maekawa er al. , 1988 ) was isolated from a Agt11 library .
A BamHI site was inserted upstream of the ATG using PCR and a Bam-EcoRI fragment was cloned into pGEX-2T .
For transfection experiments , an EcoRI fragment spanning the AP-2 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of pDP18 ( Garcia er al. , 1989 ) .
A tax cDNA ( Wano ert al. , 1988 ) was cloned into the EcoRI site of pDP18 .
PCR reactions AP-2 cDNA was hexamer primed from 10 pg of total Jurkat E cDNA using reagents and conditions prescribed in a Promega Riboclone cDNA synthesis kit .
A mock cDNA synthesis was performed by deleting AMV reverse transcriptase from the reaction mix and was used as a negative control template for subsequent PCR analysis .
One-tenth of the hexamer primed cDNA was used as a template for PCR which was performed in a DNA thermal cycler using reagents from a GeneAmp Kit .
The reaction was heated for 5 min at 94°C and was subsequently incubated for 40 cycles of PCR ( 55°C , 1 min ; 72°C , 1 min ; 94°C , 1 min ) .
2 al of the reaction was reamplified for 40 cycles using a nested antisense primer .
25mer oligonucleotide primers used for PCR contained sequences corresponding to the following positions in the AP-2 cDNA ( Williams er a/ .
, 1988 ) : sense primer ( nt 63-87 ) , antisense primer ( nt 701-725 ) , 5-GAGGGAGCGAGAGGCGACCCG-GAACT-3 ' ; antisense nested primer ( nt 599-623 ) , 5-GCTGTTGGAC-TTGGACAGGGACACG-3 ' .
PCR products were separated on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel , electroeluted from the polyacrylamide , phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and cloned into pUC 19 for DNA sequencing .
In vitro transcription and translation For in vitro translation , AP-2/pGEM2 was linearized with HindIII and transcribed in vitro using a commercial kit for RNA synthesis ( Promega ) .
RNA was translated in vitro with micrococcal nuclease treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate in 50 pl reaction volume , as directed by the supplier ( Promega ) .
For analysis of the translation products , proteins were labeled with [ °S ) methionine and a 5 gl aliquot was run on an 8 % SDS-poly-acrylamide gel .
After electrophoresis , the gel was dried and subject to autoradiography .
Bacterial expression of AP-2 and CRE-BP1 CRE-BPUpGEX-2T , AP-2/pGEM-2T and AAP-2/pGEX-2T constructs and a control pGEX-2T without insert were transformed into £ .
coli strain JM 109 .
500 ml cultures of E.coli were grown to an of 0.7-0.9 and induced with 0.4 mM IPTG for 3 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml PBS with 1 % Triton X-100 ( Sigma ) .
Cells were mildly sonicated , debris was pelleted and supernatant incubated with 1 ml glutathione-Sepharose for 90 min at 4°C .
The beads were then washed five times with 10 ml of PBS .
Elution was done in 3 ml Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 10 mM glutathione incubated for 90 min at 4°C .
Protein was dialyzed against protein storage buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCI , pH 8.0 , 20 % glycerol , then against 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) .
Gel retardation analysis For gel retardation analysis 1-2 ug of nuclear extract ( Dignam er al. , 1983 ) prepared from SLB , Jurkat or HeLa cell lines was used .
Gel retardation with in vitro translated AP-2 was done with 1 al of a 50 ul reaction .
When bacterially produced AP-2 ( Williams er a/. , 1988 ) or CRE-BPI ( Maekawa et al. , 1988 ) proteins ( either fused to glutathione-S-transferase or cleaved with thrombin ) were used , 50-100 ng of extract was added to each reaction .
In all cases , extracts were incubated with 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) in binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCI , pH 7.4 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 5 % glycerol , BSA 50 ug/ml , 50 mM NaCl ) for 10 min .
When competition was performed , the proteins were incubated for a further 10 min with 50 ng cold oligonucleotide unless otherwise indicated .
The labeled probe ( 50 000 c.p.m . )
was added to the mixture and after 20 min , incubation at room temperature , the samples were loaded on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.25 x TBE ( 1 x TBE is 89 mM Tris/89 mM borate pH 8.3 , 1 mM EDTA ) .
Oligonucleotides used had the following sequences : 21 bp repeat I , 5-CCAGACTAAGGCTCTGACGTCTCCCCCC-CGGA-3 ' ; 21 bp repeat II , 5-CTCGGGCTAGGCCCTGACGTG-TCCCCCTGAA-3 ' ; 21 bp repeat III , 5'-TCGACGTCCTCAGGC-GTTGACGACAACCCTCAG-3 ' ; mutated A box 21 bp III , ACGTCCTCGAATGTTGACGACAACCCCTCAC-3 ' ; mutated B box 21 bp III , 5-TCGACGTCCTCAGGCGTCAATAACAACCCCTCAC-3 ' ; mutated C box 21 bp III , 5-TCGACGTCCTCAGGCGTTGACGA-CAATTATTCAC-3 ' ; mutated A and C boxes III , 5-TCGACGTC-CTCGAATGTTGACGACAATTATTCAC-3 ' ; mutated A , B , and C boxes III 5-CGACGTCCTCGAATGTCAATAACAATTATTCAC-3 ' ; metallothionein 5-TCGACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGTTGTGCAGC-3 ' .
HTLV-I LTR CAT deletion constructs All constructs containing the HTLV-I LTR were inserted into the pUC19 polylinker of pJGFCAT ( Garcia er al. , 1989 ) .
In vitro site-directed mutagenesis ( Amersham ) was performed to introduce the identical mutations into the A box as shown in the A box mutated oligonucleotides used in gel retardation analysis .
An additional site-directed mutation ( T-C at position -120 ) was introduced for cloning purposes .
The wild-type HTLV-I LTR construct was constructed by inserting a Smal ( -323 ) ~Hhal ( +24 ) end-filled fragment into the Smal site in pJGFCAT .
The -210 construct contained an end-filled Aval -fhal fragment ; the - 167 construct contained an A/lul-H/al end-filled fragment ; and the -120 fragment contained an Niall -Hhal end-filled fragment .
These fragments were all inserted into pJGFCAT 19 restricted with Smal or SphI-Smal .
The -210 A-120/-55 construct contained the end-filled Aval-N/alll fragment joined to an Ndel ( -55 ) /Hhal ( +24 ) end-filled fragment and the -323 A-210/-55 fragment contained a Smal ( -323 ) -Aval ( -210 ) fragment joined to an Ndel ( -55 ) /Hhal ( +24 ) end-filled fragment .
Each construct was cloned into the Smal site of pJGFCAT 19 .
