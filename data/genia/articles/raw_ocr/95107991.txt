Cooper , September 21 , 1994 ABSTRACT The TCL1 locus on chromosome 14q32.1 is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations and inversions with one of the T-cell receptor loci in human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas .
The chromosome 14 region trans-located or rearranged involves ~350 kb of DNA at chromosome band 14q32.1 .
Within this region we have identified a gene coding for a 1.3-kb transcript , expressed only in restricted subsets of cells within the lymphoid lineage and expressed at high levels in leukemic cells carrying a t ( 14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q432 ) chromosome translocation or a inv ( 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) chromosome in-version .
The cognate cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame of 342 nt encoding a protein of 14 kDa .
The TCLI gene sequence , which , to our knowledge , shows no sequence homology with other human genes , is preferentially expressed early in T- and B-lymphocyte differentiation .
Nonrandom chromosomal translocations are characteristic of most human hematopoetic malignancies ( 1 ) .
In B and T cells , chromosomal translocations and inversions often occur as a consequence of mistakes during the normal process of recombination of the genes for immunoglobulins or T-cell receptors ( TCRs ) .
These rearrangements juxtapose enhancer elements of the immunoglobulin or TCR genes to oncogenes whose expression is then deregulated ( 2 ) .
In the majority of the cases , the rearrangements observed in lymphoid malignancies occur between two different chromosomes .
Rearrangements of the TCLI locus at chromosome 14q32.1 are unique , in that the other locus involved in these rearrangements , namely , the TCR a/ 8 locus , is also on chromosome 14 at subband qll ( 3 , 4 ) .
For this reason , the rearrangements observed cytogenetically are either chromosomal inversions , inv ( 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) , involving only one of the chromosomes 14 or translocations involving both chromosomes 14 , such as the t ( 14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) or , more rarely , the t ( 7 ; 14 ) ( q35 ; q32 ) involving the TCRB locus at 7435 ( 4 ) .
These abnormalities are associated with postthymic types of T-cell leukemias , such as T-prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) ( 5 ) and acute or chronic T-cell leukemias developing in patients with ataxia te-langectasia ( 6 , 7 ) .
Several of the breakpoints at 14q32.1 involved in these translocations have been cloned and char-acterized , but the putative TCLI oncogene had not been identified ( 6 , 8-10 ) .
We have recently cloned the entire TCLI locus , a chromosomal region of ~350 kb , as determined by placement of translocation breakpoints on the long-range genomic map ( 11 ) .
The involvement of such a large region suggests that activation of the putative TCLI gene can occur from a distance of many kilobases , as previously observed for the BCL1I/CCND1 gene in mantle-cell lymphoma ( 12-15 ) and the MYC oncogene in Burkitt lymphoma ( 16 , 17 ) and in acute The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

12530 T-cell leukemia ( 18 ) .
It also became evident from the mapping studies that the breakpoints of the different rearrangements segregate in two clusters ; inversions on the centromeric side and simple balanced translocations on the telomeric side ( see Fig .
1 ) .
We thus postulated that if the target gene activated by these different types of chromosomal rearrangements is the same , the gene must reside between the two clusters of breakpoints in a region of ~160 kb .
We have used two approaches to search for the elusive TCL ] gene : exon trapping and Northern blot hybridization with unique probes derived from genomic clones adjacent to CG-rich regions .
In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of the TCL1 gene !
and its preferential expression early in both the T- and B-lymphocyte differentiation pathways .
METHODS Isolation of Unique Probes .
DNA of P1 clones 7-4 and 20-21 were doubly digested , the former with Cla I and EcoRI and the latter with Sal I and EcoRI or with Eag I and HindIII , and subcloned in pBSII ( Stratagene ) .
DNA of the positive sub-clones was prepared by standard minipreparation method ( 19 ) .
Repeat-free DNA fragments were identified by Southern blot hybridization with human cot-1 DNA ( 20 ) .
Exon Trapping .
The pES53 vector was kindly provided by M. Ohta ( Jefferson Cancer Institute ) ; it is a reproduction of the pMHC2 vector ( 21 ) .
It contains a portion of p53 exon 10 , intron 10 , and a portion of exon 11 ; a unique Bagi II site is present in intron 10 for cloning .
DNA of P1 clones 7-4 and 20-21 ( each at 1 ug ) was partially digested with Sau3A .
The digested DNA of between 0.5 and 5 kb was isolated and cloned into the Bai II site of pE53 .
Cloned DNA , 5-10 ug , was transfected into semiconfluent COS-7 cells by using Lipofectase ( BRL ) .
After 30 h , total RNA was isolated as described by Buckler et al .
( 22 ) .
Amplification of total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) was carried out with primers and procedures described by Hamaguchi et al .
( 21 ) .
Isolation of TCLI cDNA .
A cDNA library was constructed with a commercial kit for A Zap cDNA synthesis ( Stratagene ) .
The ligation was packaged with Gigapak II Gold packaging extract ( Stratagene ) .
cDNA libraries constructed from the cell lines ALL1 and 697 were kindly donated by T. Nakamura and A. ar-Rushdi , respectively ( Jefferson Cancer Institute ) .
The libraries were plated and screened with standard protocols ( 20 ) . '

Prokaryotic Expression .
p697 cDNA was digested with Nco I and EcoRI , and the 5 ' protruding ends were filled-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I ( 19 ) .
The purified DNA fragment was ligated to pQE30 ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) previously digested with BamHI and blunted with the Klenow polymerase .
Positives clones were selected and the presence of a continuous open reading frame ( ORF ) between the vector ATG and the cDNA ATG was confirmed by sequence analysis .
Induction of expression of the cloned sequences and purification of the recombinant peptide were carried out according to Qiagen .
In Vitro Translation .
A plasmid , pALL1 , containing full-length TCLI cDNA was linearized by digestion with Cia I and transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system ( Promega ) .
RT-PCR .
First-strand DNA synthesis was performed using 1 ug of total RNA with either Moloney murine leukemia virus ( BRL ) or avian myeloblastosis virus or Superscript ( BRL ) reverse transcriptase and respective reaction buffers with either oligo ( dT ) or random primers ; 10 % of the reaction mixture was subsequently used for each single PCR ampli-fication .
Amplification of DNA from isolated populations of bone marrow B cells , T-cell lines , peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) , phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -stimulated PBL s , and thymus cells was carried out with primers p9A ( TGCTGCCAGATGACTGATGT ) and RevIll ( CAAATG-GAATCCTCCTTGGC ) , under the following conditions : denaturing 1 min at 94°C , annealing 1 min at 58°C , and elongation 1 min at 72°C for a total 30 cycles .
Amplification of DNA from patients with T-PLL was carried out with TCLLI primers Daudi unil ( AGGCCTATGACCCCCACC ) and Daudi rev2 ( CATTCCTCCCAGACCCCA ) , under the same conditions as above , except for the annealing temperature , which was 60°C .
The PCR internal standard used primers specific for the B-actin gene were used : A1 ( TCATCACCAT-TGGCAATGAG ) and A2 ( CAGTGTGTTGGCGTA-CAGGT ) .
These primers were used under the same conditions as the TCLI primers .

Mononuclear bone marrow cells were then isolated by centrifugation of cell suspensions over a Ficoll/Hypaque gradient ( 23 ) .
The monoclonal antibodies used for cell surface analysis included anti-human Leu-12 , which recognizes the pan-B cell antigen CD19 , anti-human HPCA-2 , which detects the early stem cell marker CD34 ( Becton Dickinson ) , and goat anti-human IgM ( Southern Biotechnology Associates ) .
For two-color surface analysis for cell sorting , viable FBM cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD34 antibodies or goat anti-human IgM for 15 min on ice , washed with PBS containing 2 % ( vol/vol ) HIFCS , and counterstained with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for CD19 .
Subpopulations of lymphocytes were sorted according to immunofluorescence and light scatter characteristics with a FACStar instrument ( Becton Dickinson ) .
The lymphocyte subpopulations collected were CD34*CD19~ , CD34*CD19+ , CD19®m~ , CD19 '' ' p- , CD19+w ' '' * , and CD19+ p '' .
Cells were collected and counted , and total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent ( Molecular Research Cen-ter ) .
Cell Lines and Lymphocytes .
The majority of the cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection .
SupT11 is a cell line derived from patient NL ( 24 ) .
Peripheral lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood by centrifugation on a Ficoll/Hypaque gradient , followed by a 1-h adherence to Petri dishes to remove the monocytes .
Stimulation with PHA was carried at a final concentration of 0.1 % for 3 days .
Patients 62 and 312 presented with T-PLL involving an inversion of chromosome 14 , inv ( 14 ) ( q11 ; q32.1 ) .
RESULTS Cloning of the TCL1I Gene .
The search for the TCLI gene was focused on the region included between the two sets of breakpoints of =~160 kb and encompassed by the P1 clones 7-4 and 20-21 ( 11 ) , as illustrated in Fig .

To identify transcribed sequences , the area surrounding restriction sites of rare cutter enzymes in these two P1 clones was subcloned and unique probes were isolated .

content , may indicate the existence of a CpG island ; such CpG islands are often found in the proximity of transcribed genes ( 25 ) .
Four probes were generated in this way , 7-4CE , 20-78E , 20-7HE , and 9-1KK ( see Fig .
1 ) , and hybridized to Northern blots containing RNAs from lymphoid and myelogenous cell lines .
Only the probe 20-7HE , derived from sequences adjacent to a Not I site ( Fig .
1 ) , detected a transcript in the RNA from hematopoetic cell lines .
This transcript ~1.3 kb was clearly visible in the pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line ALL380 and in the endemic Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi ( Fig .
2 ) .
Three cDNA libraries , constructed from RNA from a endemic Burkitt lymphoma cell line ( Daudi ) and two pre-B-cell lines ( 697 and ALL1 ) , all of which expressed high levels of the 1.3-kb transcript , were screened with the 20-7HE probe , and positive clones were obtained from each library .
These clones were designated pAlDaudi , pAIl.5 , and p697 .
In a parallel effort to identify transcripts , the P1 clones 20-21 and 7-4 were partially digested with Sau3A and cloned into an exon-trapping vector containing exon 10 , intron 10 , and exon 11 of the p53 gene .
Several putative exons were isolated , but the majority were due to aberrant splicing at cryptic splicing sites .
Some trapped DNA fragments contained Alu repeat sequences and one had high homology to transposon-like sequences .
However , the sequence of one of the trapped fragments matched the sequence of the cDNA isolated from the 697 and ALL1 libraries and was later found to correspond to exon 3 of the gene .
Sequence Analysis of cDNA Clones .
All three cDNA clones were entirely sequenced and the complete sequence of pAIl.5 is shown in Fig .
3 .
Upon sequence comparison , pAlIl.5 and p697 cDNAs were found to be identical , except for a base-pair substitution at position 404 where a cytidine in pAIl.5 is a thymidine in p697 cDNA .
pA1lDaudi is incomplete at the 5 ' end , missing the first 88 nt , and additionally showed two small internal deletions : the pentamer ATGGT at position 394 and the octamer CTGCCCTT at position 707 ( Fig .
3 ) .
All three clones of cDNA had 3 ' untranslated regions of slightly different length ; pAIl.5 contains the longest one with the presence of a consensus polyadenylylation signal at position 1293 .
Sequence analysis of the isolated cDNAs showed the presence of two long ORFs .
Frame 1 contains an ORF of 342 nt with a starting ATG codon at position 46 , located within a perfect Kozak consensus sequence , and with a stop codon at position 388 ( Fig .
3 ) .
This ORF potentially encodes for a protein of 114 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 13.5 kDa .
Frame 2 contains an ORF with a starting ATG codon at position 383 and a stop codon at position 773 , to give a putative protein of 14.5 kDa .
However , the presence of a point mutation in this second ORF , a deletion in two of the three independently isolated cDNA clones , and the position of this ORF on only the last exon led us to believe that the second ORF is not translated .
To confirm the presence of an ORF and its ability to encode a protein , the entire cDNA was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE30 .
Fig .
4 shows the specific induction of a 14-kDa protein and the protein after purifica-tion .
These results were also confirmed by in vitro translation ( data not shown ) .

Expression of the TCLI Gene in T-Cell Leukemia .
To determine whether the isolated gene is deregulated in cells with the t ( 14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) translocation , we carried out a Northern blot analysis comparing the amount of TCLL transcript present in resting PBL s , PHA-activated PBL s , SupT11 cells [ a cell line established from a patient with acute T-lymphocytic leukemia with a t ( 14 ; 14 ) chromosomal translocation ( 10 , 25 ) ] , and a variety of human cell lines derived from T-cell leukemias ( Table 1 ) .

We detected high levels of expression in SupT11 cells ( Fig .
5A ) .
No expression was detectable in several other tumor-derived T-cell lines lacking the TCLJ translocation , such as MOLT-4 , HUT 78 , Jurkat , and SupT1 cells ( Fig .
5B and Table 1 ) .
These results were also confirmed by the sensitive assay of RT-PCR as shown in Fig .
5C .
Of interest is the fact that SupT1 cells carry an inverted chromosome 14 , inv14 ( q11 ; q32 ) , in which the TCRa locus is not juxtaposed to the TCL1 but is positioned in front of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus at 14q32.3 ( 26 , 27 ) .
Thus an inversion of chromosome 14 that does not involve the TCL1 locus is unable to deregulate the TCLI gene .
Furthermore , we performed a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis on cells from two patients with T-PLL carrying an inversion of chromosome 14 , inv { ( 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) .
Both showed high expression levels of the TCL1 gene , comparable to those observed in the SupT11 cell line ( Fig .

Expression of the TCL Gene in Tumors and Normal Human Tissues .
A large number of RNAs from tumor cell lines , both of lymphoid and nonlymphoid origin , were screened to study the pattern of expression of the TCLI gene .
The results summarized in Table 1 reveal that the gene is expressed at high levels in pre-B cells and in endemic Burkitt lymphoma cells , which express cell surface IgM and do not secrete immunoglobulin ( 28 ) , but is not expressed in sporadic Burkitt Table 1 .

This pattern of B-lineage expression is illustrated by the presence of TCLZ transcripts in 697 , ALL-1 , and BV173 cell lines , all with a pre-B-cell phenotype , and by its absence in the pro-B lines and in B-lymphoblastoid cell lines , such as GM1500 and RPMI 8866 .
Expression of the TCLI gene was evaluated at different stages of normal B-cell differentiation .
Fetal bone marrow B-cell subpopulations were isolated by flow cytometry , cDNAs were prepared , and PCR was carried out with a primer from exon 3 , p9A , and a primer from the 3 ' untranslated region , RevIlI , to give a fragment of 270 bp ( Fig .

No signal is present in the CD34*CD19~ stem-cell-rich fraction ; weak expression appears in the CD34*CD19* subpopulation of pro-B cells , and expression peaks in IgM-negative pre-B cells expressing high levels of CD19 .
TCLLI expression persists in immature Ig M+ B cells ( Fig .
7 ) in the fetal bone marrow .
TCL1 transcripts were also detected in fetal thymocytes ( Fig .
5C ) , but not in T cells in the circulation , unless these were activated in vitro ( Fig .
5 A and C ) .
When the fetal thymocytes were sorted into subpopulations , TCLI transcripts were detected in the progenitor subpopulation of CD4-CD8~CD3~ thymocytes , but not in the cortical population ( CD4*CD8* ) ( data not shown ) .
No expression of TCL1 was observed in myelogenous cell lines or in cell lines derived from gastric ( MCG , KATO ) , mammary ( MCF7 ) , prostate ( LNCap , PC3 ) , and colorectal ( SW48 ) carcinomas ( Table 1 ) .
No expression of this gene was observed in polyadenylylated RNA isolated from a variety of normal human tissues including heart , brain , placenta , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney , and pancreas ( data not 1 `` 2 a .

Thus , these results suggest that TCLI is constitu-tively expressed early in T- and B-lymphocyte differentiation within their respective central lymphoid tissues and may be reexpressed after the activation of peripheral T cells .
DISCUSSION The TCLI gene is located in a chromosomal region banded by two clusters of breakpoints .
In its strategic position , between the two clusters of breakpoints , the TCLI gene becomes juxtaposed to TCR-Ca/8 regulatory elements in both types of rearrangements involving 14q32.1 .
For inversions , the TCLLI gene is telomeric to the 14q32.1 break ; hence , the central part of the chromosome between q11 and q32 has flipped upside down and Ca/8 has been positioned centromeric and in proximity to the TCLI gene ; the same holds true for translocations with inverted duplication .
For simple translocations , the gene is centromeric to the breaks and does not move during the rearrangement .
In this case the break on the other chromosome 14 occurs in TCR a/8 locus that moves to a region telomeric to the TCLI gene .
In this model of activation the TCL I gene is activated by the control elements of the TCR gene , whether they are positioned 5 ' of the TCL ] gene , as for translocations , or 3 ' to TCL1 , as for inversions .
A similar situation has been observed in Burkitt lymphomas , where the immunoglobulin enhancers can be located upstream or downstream to the MYC oncogene ( 16 , 18 , 29 , 30 ) .
Similarly , immunoglobulin enhancers are found downstream to the BCL2 gene in follicular lymphomas ( 31 , 32 ) and upstream to the BCL2 gene in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( 33 ) .
The study of a variety of cell lines for the expression of the TCL1 gene indicates that it is expressed preferentially in cells of lymphoid lineage .
Constitutive expression of TCL I begins in normal B-lineage cells as early as the CD34*CDI19* pro-B-cell stage .
Its expression peaks in pre-B cells , which express high levels of CD19 but no cell surface IgM , and its expression persists in immature Ig M* cells in the bone marrow .
In contrast , mature B cells in the periphery do not express TCL1 .
These findings parallel the results obtained with the lymphoid cell lines where pro-B-cell lines with the t ( 4 ; 11 ) chromosome translocation failed to express TCLI , while pre-B-cell lines expressed TCL/ transcripts .
A similar pattern of TCL1I expression is noted for early T-lineage cells .
Immature thymocytes , including the intermediate CD4*/ CD8 + population , express TCLI transcripts , whereas mature T cells in circulation do not , unless they are activated , when TCL1 transcripts may be expressed in relatively low levels .
These data suggest that expression of the TCL ] gene may be linked to immunoglobulin and TCR gene rearrangement and expression .
The high level of expression of TCL ] in leukemic T cells with the t ( 14 ; 14 ) translocation and the inv ( { ( 14 ) inver-sion , but not in leukemic T-cell lines with other types of chromosomal rearrangements , strongly supports the conclusion that this gene becomes deregulated as a consequence of its juxtaposition to the a/8 TCR locus .
