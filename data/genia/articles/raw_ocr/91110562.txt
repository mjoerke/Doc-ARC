In fact , IFNs inhibit growth of various normal and transformed cell types .
Previously , a nuclear factor , IRF-1 ( interferon regulatory factor 1 ) , which binds to type I IFN and some IFN-inducible gene promoters , was identified and cloned .
Since the IRF-1 gene is both virus and IFN inducible , an intriguing issue is raised as to whether the IRF-1 gene is functioning in IFN-mediated regulation of cell growth and differentiation .
In this study , we generated transgenic mice carrying the human IRF-1 gene linked to the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer .
In the transgenic mice , all the lymphoid tissues examined showed a dramatic reduction in the number of B lymphocytes ( B cells ) .
Preparation and analysis of bone marrow cells from the chimeric mice indicated that the bone marrow is the effective site for specific depletion of the B-cell population .
In fact , transgenic bone marrow cells cocultured with a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line revealed an altered B-cell maturation pattern .
Cytokines represent a class of soluble mediators that affect various aspects of cellular responses such as stimulation and inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation .
Each cytokine delivers signals through specific cognate receptors ( 1 , 2 ) .
Despite extensive characterization of the structure and function of many cytokines and their receptors , the molecular mechanism by which cytokine-mediated signal transduction leads to cellular responses still remains unclear , especially with respect to the nuclear events that would control the fate of responding cells .
Interferons ( IFNs ) have been originally identified in the context of host defense mechanisms against viral infection ( 3-5 ) .
In fact , all IFN species-i.e. , type I IFNs ( IFN-a and IFN- $ 8 ) , and type II IFN ( IFN-y ) -elicit potent antiviral activity of their target cells .
On the other hand , they also manifest other biological activities like many other cytokines .
In particular , much attention has been focused on IFNs functioning as potent inhibitors of cell proliferation , thus playing a crucial role in the growth control of normal and transformed cells ( 5-10 ) .
Hence , IFNs belong to the family of `` negative growth factors . ''
In fact , frequent deletion of the type I IFN loci has been reported in some malignancies ( 11 , 12 ) .
Such observations may lend support to the prevailing notion that cells that fail to produce negative growth factors or respond to them are prone to acquire malignant pheno-types ( 13 ) .

This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
532 During the course of our study on the regulation of type I IFN gene expression , we identified and cloned nuclear factor , termed IRF-1 ( IFN regulatory factor 1 ) , that binds to the upstream cis elements of both IFN-a and IFN- genes ( 14-16 ) .
A series of IRF-1 cDNA expression studies revealed IRF-1 functioning as a transcriptional activator for the type I IFN genes ( 17-19 ) .
Subsequently , another factor IRF-2 has been identified that apparently antagonizes the IRF-1 effect by competing for the same cis elements ( 18 ) .
It was then found that expression of the IRF-1 gene ( as well as the IRF-2 gene ) itself is induced not only by viruses , but also by the IFNs ; the IRF-1 gene is otherwise expressed only at very low levels ( a few mRNA copies per cell ; refs .
18 and 20 ) .
In fact , IRF binding sites have been identified in a number of IFN-inducible genes ( 16 ) .
The binding sites indeed fall in the sequences that were originally identified as IFN-response sequences within the promoter region of those genes ( 21 , 22 ) .
Thus , it has been assumed that cellular responses to IFNs are mediated at least in part by the IFN-inducible IRF-1 ( 18 , 20 ) .
The fact that IFNs function as negative growth factors and that the IRF-1 gene is IFN inducible raises an interesting issue concerning whether IRF-1 plays a role in the IFN-mediated cellular response ; that is , the regulation of cell growth .
In this context , IRF-1 might cause cell growth inhibition by affecting expression of the IFN genes and/or genes that are directly involved in cell growth inhibition .
In this regard , the human IRF-1 gene has recently been assigned to human chromosome 5q23-31 by restriction fragment length polymorphism linkage analysis ( S.1. , H. Harada , and Y. Nakamura , unpublished data ) .
Interestingly , this region has been termed the `` critical region , '' which is frequently deleted in some myeloid disorders ( 23 ) .
Thus , the observation has raised the possibility that the cells that fail to respond to IFNs include those lacking the IRF-1 gene .
As an approach to assess the possible role of IRF-1 in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation , we generated transgenic mice carrying the human IRF-1 gene whose con-stitutive and high level expression is driven by the juxtaposed human immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer ( E , , ) .
We report that such transgenic mice show a dramatic reduction in B lymphocyte ( B cell ) population .

Preparation of Bone Marrow Chimeric Mice .
Bone marrow cells were isolated from either transgenic or littermate mice and 8 x 10° cells were injected intravenously into lethally irradiated ( 880 rad by a Cs source ; 1 rad = 0.01 Gy ) 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice ; the lymphoid cells were analyzed for surface marker expression 8 weeks after reconstitution .
Analysis of B-Cell Precursor Frequency and Colony-Forming Unit-Interleukin 7 ( CFU-IL-7 ) Frequency from Bone Marrow Cells .
Analysis of B-cell precursor frequency and CFU-IL-7 frequency was as described ( 34 , 35 ) .
Briefly , a 96-well microculture plate seeded with a subconfluent layer of stromal cell line PA6 was prepared and 10° bone marrow cells were overlaid with IL-7 ( 20 units/ml ) and cultured for 12 days .
Wells containing pre-B cells ( identified as B220-positive cells by FACS analysis ) were scored and frequency was determined based on a Poisson distribution ( 34 , 35 ) .
CFU-IL-7 or CFU-IL-3 colonies were obtained after 7 days of culture of 2 x 10+ bone marrow cells seeded on methyl-cellulose plates with IL-7 ( 10 units/ml ) or IL-3 ( 200 units/m1 ) .
Recombinant IL-3 was kindly provided by Y. Sudo ( Bio-material Research Institute , Yokohama , Japan ) and recombinant IL-7 was prepared as described ( 35 ) .
RESULTS Establishment of Transgenic Mice Containing the Human IRF-1 Gene Linked with the Human E , , .

B-Cell Population Is Dramatically Reduced in All Lymphoid Tissues of Transgenic Mice .
The lymphocyte subset of these transgenic and littermate mice was examined by two-color FACS analysis .
Fig .
2 shows the results of the two-color FACS analysis of the various lymphoid tissue cells stained with the pan B-cell marker anti-B220 , and the pan T-cell marker anti-Thy1.2 .
The B220-positive B-cell fraction was dramatically reduced in spleen ( Fig .
2a ) , peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) ( Fig .
2b ) , lymph node ( mesenchymal ) ( Fig .
2¢c ) , and bone marrow ( Fig .
2d ) of the transgenic mice .
In the spleen , B220-positive B cells constituted only ~1 % of the total cell population in the transgenic line , whereas in littermates 68 % were B220 positive ( Fig .
2g ) .
In PBLs and lymph nodes , the B220-positive cells constituted < 1 % in the transgenic line .
However , in bone marrow , a significant number of cells ( 21 % ) were B220 positive .
The observation that the transgenic mice are devoid of most B220-positive B cells in all the lymphoid tissues except bone marrow suggests that bone marrow may be primarily responsible for the reduction , since this is where B-cell differentiation initiates ( 36 , 37 ) .
Analysis of bone marrow chimeric mice reconstituted by the transgenic bone marrow cells also supported this view ( see below and Fig .
5 ) .
Subsequently , 14 Fj transgenic offspring and littermates from line 7 were analyzed for their lymphocyte subset SRBC _._ , | _J __ _ __ Proc .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) composition , revealing that the B-cell-specific reduction is perfectly concordant with the transmission of the transgene .
Moreover , the other transgenic mouse line 5-2 gave similar findings ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the specific reduction in the B-cell population is not due to the effect of integration of the transgene into a specific site on host chromosomes .
No particular change in the T-cell subpopulations expressing surface markers such as Thy1.2 , L3T4 ( CD4 ) , and Lyt-2 ( CD8 ) were observed in the thymus of transgenic mice when compared to those from littermates ( Fig .
2 ) .
Lymphocyte-Specific Expression of mRNA for the Transgene .
We next examined the expression of the mRNA from the transgene in various tissues by Northern blotting analysis .
Total RNA was isolated from various tissues and hybridized with a human IRF-1-specific probe .
As shown in Fig .
3 , RNA specific for the transgene was expressed constitutively in lymphoid tissues , with levels highest in thymus , followed by bone marrow and spleen ( Fig .
3 ) .
Mitogenic Response of the Lymphocytes and Measurement of the PFCs in Spleen Cells .
To gain insights into the alterations of lymphocyte function in transgenic mice , responses of the spleen cells to B-cell-specific mitogen lipopolysaccharide and T-cell-specific mitogen ( ConA ) were examined .
Spleen cells were isolated from a transgenic or littermate mouse and the response to each mitogen was measured by incorporation of [ *H ] thymidine .
As shown in Fig .
4a , the magnitude of response to lipopolysaccharide by cells from the transgenic mouse was reduced by 94 % , compared to that of similarly treated cells from the littermate .
On the other hand , no evident difference was detected for the ConA response between the two groups .
To assess the functional status of the humoral immune response , numbers of antibody-producing cells for SRBCs were measured by hemolytic PFC assay in the spleen cells from SRBC immunized or nonimmunized , transgenic or littermate mice .
As shown in Fig .
46 , the numbers of anti-SRBC antibody-producing cells were dramatically lower in the transgenic line compared to the littermates .
Bone Marrow Is Primarily Responsible for the Reduction in the B-Cell Fraction .
As the human E , , was linked to the transgene , we assumed that the B-cell-specific reduction was primarily mediated in the bone marrow .
To directly examine this possibility , bone marrow chimeric mice were made and analyzed for the composition of their lymphocyte subset .
Lethally irradiated ( 880 rad ) syngeneic C57BL/6 mice were injected intravenously with bone marrow cells ( 8 x 10° cells per mouse ) derived from either a transgenic or a littermate j Fig .

Eight weeks later , cells from lymphoid tissues were analyzed by two-color FACS analysis ( Fig .
5 ) .
The chimeric mouse reconstituted with transgenic bone marrow cells showed a similar staining pattern as the transgenic donor .
As shown in Fig .
5 , the B-cell fraction was dramatically reduced in the spleen , PBLs , and lymph nodes .
These observations indicate that transgenic bone marrow is primarily responsible for the depletion of B-lineage cells .
In Vitro Culture of Transgenic Bone Marrow Cells with a Bone Marrow-Derived Stromal Cell Line .
Recently , bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines were established by several groups and , by utilizing those cell lines , at least part of the B-cell differentiation could be reproduced in vitro by coculture with bone marrow cells ( 34 , 38-40 ) .
To test whether the B-cell differentiation program is affected in transgenic bone marrow , bone marrow cells were coculti-vated with the stromal cell line PAG ( 34 ) and IL-7 .
As summarized in Table 1 , the frequency of pre-B-cell generation is dramatically lower in transgenic bone marrow compared with that of the littermate mouse .
The altered B-cell maturation was also illustrated by the CFU-IL-7-dependent colony formation assay ( Table 1 ; ref .
41 ) .
The CFU-IL-7 colony formation was undetectable in the transgenic line , whereas the number of cells for multicolony formation by IL-3 ( CFU-IL-3 ) was similar in transgenic and littermate mice , indicating that hematopoiesis is not affected in transgenic mice ( Table 1 ) .
DISCUSSION Much attention has been focused on IFNs for their effects on growth or differentiation in various cell types .
In the case of hematopoietic cells , IFN treatment of normal hematopoietic cells results in inhibition of growth or differentiation ( 5-10 ) .
In fact , aberrant production of IFNs was found to be accompanied by the human pathological state aplastic anemia , suggesting further the negative effects of IFNs in cell growth Proc .

In a similar context , reports that several transformed cells of various origins were accompanied with chromosomal deletions in the IFN ( IFN-a1 and IFN- $ ) gene loci are intriguing as to the role of IFNs in controlling aberrant cell growth ( 11 , 12 ) .
We have shown previously that expression of the IRF-1 gene is strongly induced not only by viruses but also by IFNs ( 18 , 20 ) .
Thus , an intriguing issue has been raised concerning the role of IRF-1 in IFN-induced cellular events , in particular for inhibition of cell growth .
In this study , we created the experimental condition in which the human IRF-1 gene is constitutively expressed at high levels by the human E , , in transgenic mice .
The IRF-1 transgene was expressed in a lymphoid tissue-specific manner and specific depletion of the B-cell population was observed in such transgenic mice .
Essentially the same observation was made with another line of transgenic mouse ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it is likely that B-cell depletion is primarily caused by the IRF-1 encoded by the transgene .
At present , it is not clear by which mechanism IRF-1 causes B-cell depletion .
Although the transgene is also expressed in the thymus , no significant alternations in T-cell population and function were observed .
It is possible that the thymic T cells do not express the IRF-1 sufficient enough to perturb their growth .
Alternatively , the IRF-1 protein might exert its function for negative cell growth through regulating the expression of cellular genes , such as IFN- and -a genes whose expression levels may depend on cell types .
So far , we have been unable to detect any IFN or IFN mRNA induction in lymphoid tissues .
In fact , we have provided evidence that production of IRF-1 per se is insufficient for IFN gene induction in differentiated cells ( 19 ) .
Although , we can not strictly rule out a very low level induction of IFN genes , it is more likely that IRF-1 affects cell growth directly rather than by inducing expression of IFNs .
Whatever the mechanisms , this may be a unique observation that cells of mice expressing the transgene for a cytokine-inducible nuclear factor are depleted .

536 Immunology : Yamada et al .
Recently , several groups showed the significant roles of IL-7 as well as bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines in their functions of supporting B-cell development ( 34 , 38-40 , 44 ) .
Nishikawa and colleagues ( 34 , 35 ) proposed that the B-cell differentiation pathways in bone marrow cells can be divided into three stages by utilizing recombinant IL-7 and bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines .
They are ( ? )
the pro-B-cell stage , which is independent of the cytokine IL-7 ( 41 ) , and ( i ? )
the early pre-B-cell stage requiring both IL-7 and stromal cells as a necessary environment , and ( /i ? )
the mature ( late ) early pre-B-cell stage in which the cells can proliferate in response to IL-7 alone .
In the present studies , the frequency of generating pre-B cells ( i.e. , during or after stage if ? )
of transgenic mice was significantly low ( Table 1 ) .
Hence , it is likely that B-cell growth is affected as soon as the E , , starts affecting expression of the transgene .
It has been shown that the murine IL-7 receptor ( IL-7R ) is expressed on pre-B cells but not on mature B cells ( 45 ) .
Interestingly , the murine IL-7R gene contains IRF-1 sites within its promoter region ( Immunex , S. F. Ziegler , personal communication ) .
Thus , overexpression of IRF-1 might affect the expression of murine IL-7R .
Recent studies indicate that IRF-2 , a factor structurally related to IRF-1 , antagonizes the IRF-1 effect by competing for the same cis elements ( 18 , 19 ) .
In view of our findings with IRF-1 transgenic mice , it will be interesting to examine whether B-cell depletion can be reversed by expressing IRF-2 at high levels .
Up to now , several model mice have been reported to have various immune abnormalities in function and/or cell composition in their immune systems .
Studies with these mice have greatly contributed to understanding the functions of the specific subset of immune cells .
Similar applications with these IRF-1 transgenic mice might provide a means of studying various immunological problems .
