The Interleukin-8 AP-1 and « B-like Sites Are Genetic End Targets of FK506-sensitive Pathway Accompanied by Calcium Mobilization* ( Received for publication , September 183 , 1993 , and in revised form , November 15 , 1993 ) Shu-ichi Okamoto ? , Naofumi Mukaidat , Kazuo Yasumoto ? # § , Nancy Ricey , Yuji Ishikawat , Hyogo Horiguchit , Seishi Murakami , and Kouji Matsushimat** From the Departments of { Pharmacology , §Surgery , and ||Biophysics , Cancer Research Institute , Kanazawa University , 13-1 , Takara-Machi , Kanazawa 920 , Japan and the Advanced BioScience Laboratories-Basic Research Program , National Cancer Institute , Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , Maryland 21702-1201 FK506 , an immunosuppressant , inhibits the production of several cytokines in T lymphocytes .
We observed that FK506 suppressed the transcription of a chemotactic cytokine , interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) in a human T cell line , Jurkat cells , activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-ac-etate ( PMA ) and calcium ( Ca** ) ionophore ( ionomycin ) .
By deleted and mutated analysis of the IL-8 promoters , the AP-1 and « B-like sites were identified as the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin .
FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the AP-1 or « B-like sites induced by PMA plus Ca**-mobilizing agents , but not those induced by Ca®*-independent stimuli .
In gel retardation analysis , FK506 had little effect on the binding to the AP-1 site of PMA/ionomycin-induced nuclear factors , which were recognized with anti-JunD or c-Fos antibody .
In contrast , FK506 or EGTA ( Ca** chelator ) similarly affected the formation of « B-like site binding complexes , which were not recognized by any antibodies against the human Rel family proteins ( c-Rel , p65 , p50 , and p49 ) .
Furthermore , we confirmed the previous report that FK506 suppressed the PMA/ionomycin-induced activation through authentic « B site of immuno-globulin ( Ig ) gene , to which NF- « B binding was also decreased by FK506 , indicating that both IL-8 xB-like site and Ig « B site are FK506-sensitive in spite of the difference of binding factors .
Our results indicate that not only the reported IL-2 NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites and Ig « B site , but also the IL-8 AP-1 and « B-like sites are terminals of FK506-sensitive pathway involving Ca** mobi-lization .
Inflammation is accompanied by the infiltration of specific types of leukocytes .
The infiltration of leukocytes is mediated by chemoattractants , one of which is IL-8 . ''
IL-8 induces che-motaxis of neutrophils , basophils , and T lymphocytes ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Furthermore , IL-8 has additional functions involved in inflammatory processes such as activation of neutrophils ( 1 , 2 ) , up-regulation of adhesion molecules ( 3 ) , and leukocytosis ( 4 ) .
These features of IL-8 suggest the involvement of aberrant IL-8 production in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases ( 1 , 2 ) .

Inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor , and lipopolysaccharide , strongly induce IL-8 production in a broad range of cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
Our previous works show that at least three cis-elements ( AP-1 , C/EBP -like , and « B-like sites ) are involved in the IL-8 gene activation ( 5-7 ) .
Interestingly , the relative importance of three elements varies in a cell type-specific manner .
In the human fibrosarcoma cell line 8387 , the C/EBP -like and « B-like sites are essential , but the AP-1 site is dispensable ( 5 , 6 ) .
In contrast , in the human gastric cancer-derived cell line MKN-45 , the AP-1 and « B-like sites are im-portant , but the C/EBP -like site is not necessary ( 7 ) .
Several suppressors of IL-8 production have been reported .
Cytokines such as IL-4 ( 8 ) , IL-10 ( 9 ) , transforming growth fac-tor-B , interferon-B , and interferon-y ( 1 , 2 , 10 ) counteract the induction of IL-8 production by IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor , or lipopolysaccharide .
Immunomodulatory drugs such as gluco-corticoids ( 11 ) and vitamin D ; ( 12 ) also act as suppressors of IL-8 production .
An immunosuppressive drug , cyclosporin A , has been reported to suppress the induction of the IL-8 mRNA in human T lymphocytes ( 13 ) .
However , the mechanism of IL-8 gene suppression by any of these substances remains to be elucidated .
FK506 is another immunosuppressive drug ( reviewed in Ref .
14 ) .
At an early step of T cell activation , both FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibit the transcription of cytokines such as IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor , tumor necrosis factor-a , and interferon-y ( 15-18 ) .
Several independent groups have examined the effect of FK506 and cyclosporin A on the nuclear factors controlling the IL-2 transcription intensively ( 19-26 ) .
FK506 and cyclosporin A suppressed the transcriptional activity through the NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites of the IL-2 gene by inhibiting the Ca**/calmod-ulin-dependent phosphatase , calcineurin ( 14 ) .
The effects on « B and AP-1 sites also have been examined .
Although AP-1 sites were reported to be resistant to FK506 and cyclosporin A ( 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 26-28 ) , the effects on xB sites are controversial .
Some groups demonstrated that FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibited the Ca**-dependent transcriptional activity on « B sites of Ig k chain gene and human immunodeficiency virus ( 21 , 23 ) , but others did not see any effects on « B site of IL-2 gene ( 14 , 20 , 24 ) .
However , the effect of FK506 and cyclosporin A on the transcriptional factors regulating the expression of other cytokine genes has been poorly explored .
The inquiries into inhibition of IL-8 production are important in terms of anti-inflammation .
In this study , we report that FK506 suppressed the IL-8 transcription in a human T cell line , Jurkat , activated with PMA and ionomycin .
We identified the AP-1 and « B-like sites on IL-8 gene as responsible elements for PMA/ionomeyin-induced activation as well as repression by FK506 treatment .
Moreover , Ca*+-mobilizing or Ca*+*-inde-pendent stimuli were used to elucidate Ca** dependence of 8582 IL-8 AP-1 and « kB-like Sites Are Targets of FK506 Action FK506 action on the responsive elements as reported on the NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites of IL-2 gene .
The effects of FK506 on the nuclear factors binding to the responsive elements were examined by gel retardation assay .
Finally , since NF- « B binding to the IL-8 « B-like site was not observed , the FK506 effect on the activation and binding factors of authentic « B site of the Ig gene was examined to compare IL-8 « B-like site with Ig « B site in FK506 action .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-Jurkat cells , human T cell leukemia-derived cells , were grown in RPMI 1640 medium ( Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Flow Laboratories , McLean , VA ) , penicillin G ( 100 units/ml , Life Technologies , Inc. ) , streptomycin ( 100 ng/ml , Life Technologies , Inc. ) , and glutamine ( 2 mm , Life Technologies , Inc. ) in a humidified incubator containing 5 % COz in air .
Oligonucleotides-Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer ( model 392 DNA/RNA Synthesizer , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) .
These oligonucleotides were used as primers for reverse tran-scriptase-polymerase chain reaction and site-directed mutagenesis or were annealed and used as probes after end-labeling with | « - '' '' P ] dCTP and Klenow polymerase , or as unlabeled competitors .
ELISA for Human IL-8-The concentration of IL-8 in the cell culture was measured by ELISA as previously described ( 29 ) .
In brief , wells on 96-well microtiter plate ( Nune , Copenhagen , Denmark ) were coated with monoclonal antibody to IL-8 .
Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C .
Polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-8 antibody was added as the second antibody .
After addition of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( Tago , Inc. , code no .
6500 , Burlingame , CA ) , the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C .
p-nitrophenyl phosphate ( 1 mg/ml , Sigma ) was added and allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature .
The reaction was stopped by adding 1 m NaOH , and the optical density at 405 nm was measured by a model MPR-A4i Micro Plate Reader ( Tosoh , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Antibodies for Human Rel Family and AP-1 Family-The antibody against the human c-Rel protein has been described previously ( 30 ) .
Rabbit antisera against the peptides at the N terminus of human p65 ( DELFPLIFPAEPAQAS ) , the N terminus of human p50 ( AFDDPYL-GRPEQMFH ) , or the N terminus of human p49 ( GESCYNPGLDGI-IEYDD ) were produced as previously described ( 31 ) .
The polyclonal IgG against c-Jun , JunB , JunD , and c-Fos were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Plasmids-A series of 5 ' deletion of the IL-8 promoter was generated and inserted into a CAT expression vector as described previously ( 5 ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis of the IL-8 AP-1 , C/EBP -like , and « B-like sites in -133 CAT plasmid , was carried out using polymerase chain reaction ( 32 ) , which converted the AP-1 site TGACTCA ( -126 to -120 bp ) to TATCTCA , the C/EBP-like site CAGTTGCAAATCGT ( -94 to -81 bp ) to AGCTTGCAAATCGT , and the « B-like site GGAATTTCCT ( -80 to -71 bp ) to TAACTTTCCT .
These constructs were designated as AP-1 site-mutated , C/EBP -like site-mutated , and « B-like site-mutated plas-mids , respectively .
Two copies of the IL-8 AP-1 binding site ( TGACTCA ) , three copies of the IL-8 « B-like site ( GGAATTTCCT } , or two copies of Ig xB site ( GGGACTTTCC ) were inserted upstream of the IL-8 enhancerless core promoter ( -50 bp to +44 bp ) linked to firefly luciferase gene .
All plasmids were prepared with Qiagen tip 500 ( Diagen GmbH , Diissel-dorf ) according to the application protocols .
Cell Transfection and CAT and Luciferase Assays-Jurkat cells ( 5 x 108 cells ) were transfected with 5 ug of plasmid DNA using DEAE-dextran ( 500 ug , Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) as described ( 33 ) .
After 24 h , PMA ( 10 ng/ml , Sigma ) , ionomycin ( 500 nm , Calbiochem Behring Corp. , La Jolla , CA ) , TNF-a ( 100 units/ml , Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Osaka , Japan ) , forskolin ( 5 um , Sigma ) , and thapsigargin ( 500 nm , Sigma ) were added to different cultures .
After additional 8 h for luciferase assay or 24 h for CAT assay in the absence or presence of the indicated amount of FK506 ( kind gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Osaka , Japan ) , cell lysate was prepared .
Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford , using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard .
CAT activity was determined using 10 ug of each sample after a 30-min incubation by standard methods ( 34 ) .
Radioactivity was quantified by a bicimaging analyzer ( BA 100 , Fuji Co. , Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) .
For luciferase assay system , PicaGene* '' * ( Toyo Ink Co. , Tokyo , Japan ) was used .
The light intensity was measured by a Lumat model LB9501 lumino-meter ( Berthold , Germany ) .

FK506 suppressed the IL-8 production from activated Jurkat cells .
Jurkat cells were activated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 nm ) in the presence of FK506 at different concentration for 2 days .
The amount of secreted IL-8 in the culture media from unstimulated ( open circles ) or activated ( closed circles ) cells were determined by ELISA .
independent transfections , and representative data are shown here .
Nuclear Extracts and Gel Retardation Assay-Jurkat cells were stimulated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) plus ionomycin ( 500 nm ) for 1 h in the presence or absence of FK506 ( 10 nm ) , or EGTA ( 3 mm ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method described by Dignam et al .
( 35 ) .
Binding reactions were carried out in 20 pl in a solution consisting of 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 60 mm KCl , 4 mm MgCl , , 0.2 mm EDTA , 1 mm dithic-threitol , 10 % glycerol , 2 % polyvinyl alcohol , 2 ug poly ( dl-dC ) -poly ( dI-dC ) .
Four ug of protein was used for each reaction .
The mixtures with or without either competitors or antibodies were incubated for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of probe ( 3 x 10 '' cpm/reaction ) .
After another 20-min incubation at 25 °C , the samples were electro-phoresed in a 6 % polyacrylamide gel ( acrylamide/N , N'-methylene bis-acrylamide , 30:1 ) with 0.25 x Tris borate electrophoresis buffer .
Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography .
RESULTS IL-8 Production by Activated Jurkat Cells Was Inhibited by FK506-A human T cell line , Jurkat cells were activated with PMA/ionomycin in the presence of different concentration of FK506 .
IL-8 was not detected from unstimulated Jurkat cells , but activated Jurkat cells secreted about 80 pg/ml IL-8 ( Fig .
1 } .
FK506 inhibited the IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner with IDs , = 0.25 nm .
The level of IL-8 mRNA was examined with reverse tran-scriptase-polymerase chain reaction .
The IL-8 mRNA was detected after 2 h of activation ( data not shown ) .
However , the IL-8 mRNA was not detected from activated cells with FK506 treatment ( data not shown ) , indicating that FK506 reduced the amount of induced IL-8 mRNA .
Since the reduction of IL-8 mRNA by FK506 was observed at early phase of activation , within 2 h , the effect of FK506 is likely to be primary .
FK506 Suppressed the Activation of CAT Gene Linked to the IL-8 Promoter-To examine whether the impairment of IL-8 mRNA induction by FK506 was due to the inhibition of the IL-8 gene transcription , the 5 ' region ( from +44 bp up to -1481 bp ) of the IL-8 gene was linked to the CAT gene and the construct was transiently transfected into Jurkat cells .
FK506 inhibited the CAT activity induced with PMA/ionomycin treatment in a dose-dependent manner with ID ; , = 0.4 ny ( Fig .
2 ) , which was similar to that for the IL-8 secretion ( 0.25 nm ) .
These findings indicated that FK506 inhibited the IL-8 transcription .
Both AP-1 and « B-like Sites Were Necessary for the IL-8 Gene Activation by PMA and Ionomycin-Since it has been reported that the cis-elements necessary for the IL-8 gene activation differed between two cell types ( 5-7 ) , the cis-elements responsible for IL-8 gene activation in Jurkat cells were identified by using various deletions of the IL-8 promoter linked to the CAT gene ( Fig .
3 ) .

Identification of the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin-induced transcription .
Various lengths of 5 franking region of the IL-8 gene , linked to CAT gene , were transfected into Jurkat cells .
The Jurkat cells were unstimulated ( open bars ) or were stimulated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 nm ) in the absence { shaded bars ) or presence ( solid bars ) of FK506 ( 10 nm ) .
After a 24 incubation , the CAT activity was measured .
fected with -94 and -85 CAT constructs .
In addition , FK506 reduced all CAT activities induced by PMA/ionomycin transfected with these plasmids .
Maximum CAT expression was induced with the -133 CAT construct .
These results suggest that the minimally essential elements for the IL-8 gene regulation are present within the 3 ' region downstream of -133 bp .
There are three known cis-elements , AP-1 ( -126 bp to -120 bp ) , C/EBP -like ( -94 bp to -81 bp ) , and « B-like ( -80 bp to -71 bp ) sites within the region downstream of -133 bp ( Fig .
4 ) ( 5-7 ) .
The regulatory role of the AP-1 , C/EBP -like , and « B-like sites was further studied by site-directed mutagenesis of each element in the -133 CAT plasmid .
When Jurkat cells were transfected with -133 ( wild type ) CAT construct , PMA/ionomycin induced a 50-fold increase of CAT activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
The mutation of either the AP-1 site or the « B-like site severely reduced this induction of the CAT activity , whereas the mutation of the C/EBP -like site had little effect on the inducibility .
Collectively , two elements ( AP-1 and « B-like sites ) were involved in the IL-8 gene activation in Jurkat cells in response to PMA and ionomycin stimulation .
FK506 Suppressed the Transcriptional Activation through IL-8 AP-1 and « B-like Sites Elicited by PMA and Ca*+*-mobilizing Agents-To examine the effects of FK506 on the transcriptional activity through the AP-1 and « B-like sites of the IL-8 gene , two copies of the IL-8 AP-1 site ( TGACTCA ) or three copies of the IL-8 « B-like site ( GGAATTTCCT ) were linked to the enhanceriess IL-8 core promoter ( -50 bp to + 44 bp ) , which was inserted upstream of firefly luciferase gene .
The luciferase gene expression driven from the IL-8 core promoter was not induced by any stimuli ( data not shown ) .

The relative importance of the AP-1 , C/EBP-like , and « B-like sites in the IL-8 promoter .
The AP-1 site ( -126 bp to -120 bp ; TGACTCA ) , C/EBP-like site ( -94 bp to -81 bp ; CAGTTGCAAATCGT ) , or « B-like site ( -80 bp to -71 bp ; GGAATTTCCT ) in the IL-8 promoter ( -133 bp to +44 bp ) , linked to CAT gene , were mutated to TATCTCA , AGCTTGCAAATCGT , and TAACTTTCCT , respectively .
The wild type and mutated plasmids were transfected into Jurkat cells .
The transfected cells were incubated without ( open bars ) or with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 nm ) ( shaded bars ) .
After a 24-h incubation , the CAT activity was determined .
« B-like site-driven transcription .
The PMA/ionomycin-induced transcription through the AP-1 or xB-like sites was inhibited by Ca ?
* chelator , EGTA ( data not shown ) , indicating that Ca** was involved in the PMA/ionomycin-induced transcriptional activation of the AP-1 and « B-like sites .
FK506 reduced the PMA/ ionomycin-induced transcriptions through both AP-1 and « B-like sites ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
Furthermore , FK506 decreased the AP-1 or « B-like site-driven transcription induced by PMA and thapsigargin ( intracellular Ca** elevating agent by inhibiting Ca '' +*-ATPase ) ( Fig .
5 , C and D ) .
In contrast , PMA alone also increased the luciferase gene expression driven from the AP-1 or « B-like sites , which was not affected by FK506 ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
In addition , Ca**-independent stimuli such as PMA plus forskolin ( activator of adenyl cyclase ) , PMA plus tumor necrosis factor-a , activated the transcription through the AP-1 or « B-like sites , which were not significantly inhibited by FK506 ( Fig .
5 , E and F ) .
Taken together , FK506 suppressed the activation through the IL-8 AP-1 and « B-like sites induced by the combination of PMA and Ca*+-mobilizing agents .
FK506 Did Not Have Apparent Effect on the Complex Formation of the AP-1 Site of the IL-8 Gene-In gel retardation assays , the nuclear factors binding to the responsive elements of the IL-8 promoter were examined .
With the IL-8 -130/-116 probe , containing the AP-1 site ( TGACTCA ; -126 bp to -120 bp ) , one complex was induced by PMA and ionomycin ( Fig .
64 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
FK506 did not have any effect on this induced complex formation ( lane 3 ) .
The complex formation was inhibited by AP-1 site oligonucleotide , but not by mutated AP-1 site oligonucleotide ( TATCTCA ) ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , indicating the specificity of this complex .
To identify the constituents of the IL-8 AP-1 site complex , polyclonal antibodies against c-Jun , JunB , JunD , or c-Fos were added to the gel retardation mixture .
Anti-JunD or anti-c-Fos antibody supershifted the complexes induced by PMA plus ionomycin in the absence ( lanes 4 and 5 ) or presence ( lanes 9 and 10 ) of FK506 , whereas other antibodies failed ( lanes 2 , 3 , 7 , and 8 ) ( Fig .
6B ) .
Thus , PMA/ionomycin treatment induced the formation of the IL-8 AP-1 site binding complex including JunD and c-Fos , which was not altered by FK506 .

Both the IL-8 AP-1 and « B-like sites were FK506-sensitive .
Two copies of the IL-8 AP-1 site ( TGACTCA ) ( 4 , C , and E ) or three copies the IL-8 « B-like site ( GGAATTTCCT ) ( B , D , and F ) were inserted into the upstream of the IL-8 enhancerless promoter ( -50 bp to + 44 bp ) linked to luciferase reporter gene , which were transiently transfected into Jurkat cells .
A and B , the transfected cells were treated with various combinations of PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( 500 nm ) , and FK506 ( 10 nm ) for 8 h before the luciferase assays .
C and D , the transfected cells were treated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) plus thapsigargin ( 500 nu ) in the presence or absence of FK506 ( 10 nm ) .
E and F , the transfected cells were treated with various combinations of PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) , forskolin ( 5 um ) , tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ; 100 units/ml ) , FK506 ( 10 nm ) .
R.L.U. , relative light unit .
Site-Incubation of radiolabeled IL-8 -83/-69 oligomer , containing the « B-like site ( GGAATTTCCT ; -80 bp to -71 bp ) , with Jurkat nuclear extracts produced three complexes ( Fig .
7A ) .
From unstimulated cells , two constitutive complexes were de-tected .
The upper faint complex was designated as complex A and the lower complex as complex B ( lane 1 ) .
After PMA/ ionomycin treatment , the amount of complex A slightly in-creased , but the level of complex B was not changed ( lane 2 ) .
From PMA plus ionomycin plus FK506 treated cells , one com plex , complex C , was detected ( lane 3 ) .
The mobility of complex C was intermediate between those of complexes A and B , which was more clear when the electrophoresis was performed for a longer time ( Fig .
7B ) .
These complexes were not formed with the mutated IL-8 « B-like site ( TAACTTTCCT ) probe ( Fig .
7A , lanes 4-6 ) and unlabeled « B-like site of the IL-8 gene inhibited the formation of complexes A-C ( Fig .

Nuclear factors binding to the AP-1 site .
A , the induction of the AP-1 site binding complex was not inhibited by FK506 .
Nuclear extracts from unstimulated Jurkat cells ( lane 1 ) , Jurkat cells treated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 nm ) ( Zanes 2 , 4 , and 5 ) , and Jurkat cells treated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( 500 ni ) , and FK506 ( 10 nm ) ( Zane 3 ) for 1 h were mixed with the labeled IL-8 promoter ( -130 bp to -116 bp ) , containing AP-1 site ( -126 bp to -120 bp ; TGACTCA ) , in the absence ( lanes 1-3 ) or presence of 50 ng of AP-1 site ( lane 4 ) or mutated AP-1 site competitors ( lane 5 ) .

Nuclear factors binding to the IL-8 « B-like site .
A , three complexes were formed with the IL-8 « B-like site in Jurkat cells .
After Jurkat cells were untreated ( Zanes I and 4 ) , treated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 500 ny ionomycin ( Zanes 2 and 5 ) , or treated with 10 ng/ml PMA , 500 nM ionomycin , and 10 nm FK506 ( lanes 3 and 6 ) for 1 h , nuclear extracts were prepared .
The nuclear extracts were mixed with labeled oligonucleotide of IL-8 promoter ( -83 bp to -69 bp ) , containing the « B-like site ( -80 bp to -71 bp ; GGAATTTCCT ) ( Zanes 1-3 ) or the mutated « B-like site ( TAACTTTCCT ) ( lanes 4-6 ) .
B , complexes A , B , and C showed different mobility .
After incubation of the IL-8 « B-like site probe and nuclear extracts from cells treated with PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )
plus ionomycin ( 500 nm ) ( Zane 1 ) or with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( 500 n ) , plus FK506 ( 10 nm ) ( lane 2 ) , the mixture were run on polyacrylamide gel for longer time ( 4 h ) .
C , calcium chelator ( EGTA ) and FK506 had similar effects on the B-like site binding complexes .
Jurkat cells were activated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) plus ionomycin ( 500 nm ) in the presence of FK506 ( 10 nm ; lane 2 ) or EGTA ( 3 mi ; lane 3 ) .
ing that Ca*+* chelator mimicked the effects of FK506 on the IL-8 kB-like site binding complexes .
This finding suggested that Ca*+-dependent pathway is involved in the complex formation of the IL-8 kB-like site , which is affected by FK506 .
Antibodies for the Rel Family Proteins Did Not Recognize Complexes A-C-Since the Rel family proteins can bind to kB sites ( 36 ) , we examined whether complexes A-C contain the Rel family proteins such as c-Rel , p65 , p50 , and p49 by using antibodies against these proteins .
None of the complex formations were affected by these antibodies ( Fig .
9 , lanes 1-10 ) .
Under the same conditions , the mobility of complex between NF-kB and the « B site of Ig k chain gene was decreased by either anti-p65 or p50 antibodies ( Fig .
10B ) .
The anti-c-Rel antibody interfered with the binding of recombinant c-Rel to an intronic enhancer element of the interferon-y gene ( 37 ) and supershifted the complex between c-Rel in PMA-stimulated Jurkat cells and the « B site of the IL-2 receptor « chain gene ( 38 ) .
Nuclear factors binding to the kB site of the IL-6 gene in a B cell line , Daudi , were supershifted by anti-c-Rel , p65 , p50 , and p49 ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that nuclear factors forming complexes A-C in Jurkat cells are immuno-chemically unrelated to c-Rel , p65 , p50 , and p49 .
It is demonstrated that mitogenic treatment of cells strongly induces NF-kB binding activity ( 39 ) .
PMA/ionomycin treatment induced the transcriptional activity through authentic kB site of the Ig gene ( Fig .
10A ) .
FK506 decreased this transcriptional activity by PMA/ionomycin .
We also observed that PMA/ ionomycin treatment strongly induced one complex bound to the Ig « B site ( Fig .
10B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
FK506 treatment decreased the amount of complex formation ( lane 3 ) .

The authentic « B site of Ig x chain gene and the IL-8 « B-like site similarly inhibited the formation of complexes A-C .
Various amounts of the oligonucleotides of the kB site ( GGGACTTTCC ) of the Ig k chain gene ( open circles ) or the IL-8 kB-like site ( GGAATTTCCT ) ( closed circles ) were mixed with the nuclear extract from PMA/ionomycin-treated ( A and B ) or PMA/ionomycin/FK506-treated ( C ) cells prior to the IL-8 B-like site probe addition .
The amounts of complexes A-C were quantified by a bioimaging analyzer .
The amount of complex in the absence of competitor is assigned as a value of 100 .

Complexes A , B , and C did not react with antibodies to the human Rel family proteins .
Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells treated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) plus ionomycin ( 500 nm ) ( Zanes 1-5 ) or with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( 500 nm ) , plus FK506 ( 10 nm ) ( Zanes 6-10 ) were preincubated without antibody ( Zanes 1 and 6 ) or with antibodies against c-Rel ( lanes 2 and 7 ) , p65 ( lanes 3 and 8 ) , p50 ( lanes 4 and 9 ) , or p49 ( lanes 5 and 10 ) .
Then , the probe of the IL-8 « B-like site was added .
duced major complex was supershifted by either anti-p65 or p50 antibody ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , indicating that PMA¥/ionomycin induced NF-kB ( p65/p50 ) , whose induction was decreased by FK506 .
In addition to NF-kB , Ig « B site probe detected several minor complexes ( Fig .
10B ) .
Since oligomer of the « B site of Ig k chain gene inhibited the formation of complexes A-C in a way similar to that of the IL-8 kB-like site ( Fig .
8 ) , some of minor complexes detected with Ig kB site probe may correspond to the IL-8 « B-like site binding complexes A-C .
These observations indicated that the main constituents of complexes bound to the IL-8 « B-like site were different from those bound to the authentic « B site of Ig k chain gene .
DISCUSSION IL-8 has potent chemotactic activity for T lymphocytes , as well as neutrophils ( 1 , 2 ) .
Jurkat T cells produced IL-8 after activation with PMA and ionomycin , although the amount ( 60 pg/ml ) of produced IL-8 was relatively low .
Since T lymphocytes are 10-fold more sensitive to IL-8 than neutrophils in chemo-taxis ( 40 ) , even a small amount of IL-8 produced by T lymphocytes may recruit other T lymphocytes rather than neutrophils , leading to the preferential infiltration of T lymphocytes observed at inflammatory sites , e.g .
the acute phase of graft rejection ( 41 ) , delayed type hypersensitivity ( 42 ) .
Recently , it was reported that FK506 inhibits the infiltration of T lymphocytes into the allograft ( 43 ) .
Since FK506 suppressed the IL-8 production by activated Jurkat T cells , it is tempting to speculate that FK506 may inhibit the recruitment of T lymphocytes into the sites of acute phase graft rejection or delayed type hypersensitivity through suppressing the IL-8 production from T lymphocytes that have migrated , thereby inhibiting immune reactions associated with T cell activities at such sites .
The AP-1 site of the IL-8 gene is sensitive to FK506 upon stimulation of PMA and Ca*+*-mobilizing agents , in contrast to the previous reports describing AP-1 sites as rather resistant to the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 ( 14 ) .
These contradictory results might arise from several differences of assay system between our report and other reports .
First , other groups used the SV40 large T antigen expressing Jurkat cells ( 27 ) or murine T lymphoma El4 cells ( 20 , 24 , 26 ) .
Second , as a AP-1 site in the reporter construction of AP-1 site-dependent transcription , we used the AP-1 binding site of the IL-8 gene whose activation was inhibited by FK506 , while others used the AP-1 sites of the metallothionein gene ( 19 , 23 , 27 ) or the collagenase gene ( 20 , 24 , 26 ) , on which the effect of FK506 is not known .
Moreover , TGACTCA was used as AP-1 binding site in this study , although the sequences used by other groups ( GTGACTCAGCGCG , TCGAGTGACTCAGCGCGTCGA , and GATGACTCAGCC ; underline indicates AP-1 site ) ( 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 ) contained extra sequences .
Therefore , our system may reflect more precise AP-1 activity .
In gel retardation analysis , PMA/ionomycin treatment induced the IL-8 AP-1 binding site complex containing JunD and c-Fos .
Although FK506 apparently did not alter the induction of JunD/c-Fos on gel retardation analysis , the PMA/ionomycin-induced transcriptional activity of the IL-8 AP-1 site was inhibited by FK506 .
These findings suggest the presence of the JunD/c-Fos activating mechanism involving Ca** mobilization , which is sensitive to FK506 .
Recently , a FK506- and cyclosporin A-sensitive factor , NFIL-2A , was reported to contain c-Jun or JunD , the activity of which was controlled by a cyclosporin A-sensitive and Ca*+-dependent mechanism ( 27 ) .
Thus , the transcriptional activity of the IL-8 AP-1 binding complex ( JunD/c-Fos ) may be suppressed by FK506 in such manners as NFIL-2A .
Although the suppressive mechanisms of activity of Jun proteins by immunosuppressive drugs remain to be elucidated at present , it has been reported that the transcriptional activity of Jun and Fos families is regulated by phosphorylation ( 44 ) .
Several serine ( s ) or threonine ( s ) within the regulatory region of c-Jun , c-Fos are phosphorylated by protein kinase A , protein kinase C , casein kinase II , p34° '' '' , MAP kinase , or glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( 45-47 ) .
Since FK506 inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin ( 48 ) , the phosphorylation states of Jun and Fos proteins may be changed by FK506 treatment in Ca*+*+-dependent manner , leading to the suppression of transcriptional activity of Jun and Fos proteins with little effect on the binding activity .

A , FK506 suppressed the PMA/ionomycin-induced transcription through authentic « B site of the Ig gene .
Two copies of Ig kB site ( GGGACTTTCC ) were inserted into the upstream of the IL-8 enhancerless promoter linked to luciferase gene .
The transfected cells were treated with PMA ( 10 ng/m1 ) , ionomycin ( 500 nm ) , and FK506 ( 10 nm ) for 8 h before the luciferase assay .
R.L.U. , relative light unit .
B , PMA and ionomycin treatment strongly induced NF-kB , which was decreased by FK506 treatment .
Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells unstimulated ( Zane 1 ) , activated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 500 nm ) in the absence ( lanes 2 and 4-7 ) or presence ( lane 3 ) of FK506 ( 10 nm ) were incubated without ( lanes 1-3 ) or with antibodies against c-Rel ( lane 4 ) , p65 ( lane 5 ) , p50 ( lane 6 ) , or p49 ( lane 7 ) before the addition of the authentic kB site probe ( GGGACTTTCC ) of Ig x chain gene .
are distinct from the reported Rel family proteins in several terms .
First , the pattern of complexes detected by the IL-8 kB-like site was different from that by the authentic Ig x site , to which NF-kB ( p65/p50 ) bound .
Second , antibodies specific for Rel family proteins failed to recognize complexes A-C. Third , upon partial purification with heparin-high performance liquid chromatography , complexes A-C were eluted at a different point from that of NF-kB ( p65/p50 ) ( data not shown ) .
Finally , the consensus sequence bound by NF-kB is GGGRNNYYCC ( R , purines ; Y , pyrimidines ; N , any nucleotides ) ( 39 ) , whereas the IL-8 « B-like site is TGGAATTTCC ( -81 bp to -72 bp ) , or AG-GAAATTCC ( -80 bp to -71 bp in the reverse orientation ) , indicating that the IL-8 kB-like site does not completely fit for the consensus sequence of kB sites .
Taken together , the slight difference of the IL-8 kB-like site from the consensus « B sites may cause the difference of the nuclear factors mainly bound to the IL-8 « kB-like site from those to the consensus « B sites .
The sensitivity of kB sites to immunosuppressive drugs is in controversy ( 14 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 24 ) .
We confirmed the previous finding that FK506 suppresses Ca*+-dependent transcriptional activation through Ig « B site , which is correlated with the change in NF-kB binding activity to the Ig « B site ( 23 ) .
In addition , we newly identified the IL-8 « kB-like site , to which NF-kB binding was not observed , as an FK506-sensitive site .
These findings suggest that the extent of FK506 action is not NF- « B-restricted , but expands to other « B ( -like ) site binding factors .
Ca** is an essential signal mediator upon T cell activation ( 49 ) .
FK506 is thought to block the signal transduction , thereby suppressing T cell functions such as cytokine production ( 14 ) .
The cytokines , of which production is suppressed by FK506 , are IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor , tumor necrosis factor- « , and interferon-y ( 15-18 ) .
Among them , NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites of the IL-2 gene have been reported to be targets of FK506-sensitive and Ca*+*-dependent signal pathway ( 14 ) .
In this study , IL-8 is newly added to the member of cytokines whose production is suppressed by FK506 .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that the AP-1 and « kB-like sites of the IL-8 gene are also targets of the FK506-sensitive pathway accompanied by Ca** mobili-zation .
Our findings suggest that multiple transcriptional ele-ments , not restricted to NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites , of cytokine genes may be controlled by Ca*+-dependent FK506-sensitive mechanisms in T cells .
