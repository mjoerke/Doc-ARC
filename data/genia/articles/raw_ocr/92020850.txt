ManoLaGas* Section of Endocrinology and Metabolism , Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Department of Medicine , Indiana University , Indianapolis , IN 46202 Communicated by Robert H. Wasserman , June 11 , 1991 ABSTRACT Using Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody recognizing a 17-amino acid epitope of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; , [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] receptor , we have detected two crossreacting proteins in activated normal human lymphocytes .
The smaller of the two proteins ( 50 kDa ) was indistinguishable from the classical 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor and , similar to the classical 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor , was upregulated in a dose-dependent fashion by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
The larger crossreacting protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of 80 kDa , was localized in the cell cytosol , and appeared to be specific for activated lymphocytes since it was not detected in several other human cells including monocytes .
More strikingly , the 80-kDa protein was downregulated in a dose-dependent fashion by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ; this effect was independent of the mode of lymphocyte activation and specific for the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , me-tabolite of vitamin D ; .
However , two potent immunosuppressive agents , glucocorticoids and cyclosporin A , also inhibited the 80-kDa protein .
Evidence obtained during the last few years has revealed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; { 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] , in addition to playing a major role in mineral and skeletal homeostasis , is involved in the regulation of immune phenomena ( 1 ) .
Indeed , monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes express vitamin D ; receptors ( VDRs ) .
In monocytes and macrophages , the receptor protein is expressed constitutively .
In peripheral blood lymphocytes , however , the receptor protein is expressed only after activation ( 2 , 3 ) .
Consistent with the presence of receptors , a series of hormonal effects on immune phenomena have been de-scribed .
Thus , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; causes changes in the proliferative response of activated lymphocytes ( 4 , 5 ) by preventing the cells from progressing from the early to late G ; phase border of the cell cycle ( 6 ) .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can also influence the production of monocyte-derived cytokines , such as in-terleukins 1 and 6 ( ref .
7 and F.G.H. , G. Girasole , and S $ .C.M. , unpublished data ) .
In addition 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreases the production of the granulocyte/macrophage col-ony-stimulating factor and interferon y in lectin-stimulated lymphocytes ( 8 , 9 ) .
Further , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibits immuno-globulin production in B lymphocytes ( 10 , 11 ) and may influence thymocyte maturation and intrathymic differentiation ( 1 ) .
In the present report , we describe the serendipitous discovery of an 80-kDa protein in activated normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes that is responsive to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
This 80-kDa protein shares immunologic crossreactivity with the VDR but is downregulated by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , in contrast to the VDR , which is upregulated by its own ligand .

to recover at 37°C for 6 hr .
Cell viability ( 96 % ) was determined by trypan blue exclusion after heat shock .
An enriched monocyte preparation obtained by Percoll gradient separation from PBMCs was also stimulated for 72 hr with LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) .
The human promyelocytic leukemic cell line HL-60 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 % heat-inactivated FBS .
The osteoblastic human osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 was maintained in McCoy 's 5A medium with 10 % FBS .
Cytosol Preparations .
At the end of the incubation , cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at pH 7.4 and counted .
Washed cells were suspended in KETD-O.3 ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4/1.5 mM EDTA/5 mM dithiothreitol/1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/0.3 M KCI ) and sonicated with three 20-sec cycles interrupted by 60-sec pauses ( Sonifer cell disrupter , Heat Systems/ Ultrasonics , Farmingdale , NY ) .
The sonicate was centrifuged for 1 hr at 105,000 x g in a L8-55 Beckman ultracen-trifuge to yield a supernatant ( cytosol ) fraction .
Human kidneys and brain cortex were obtained from cadavers and washed thoroughly with PBS at pH 7.4 .
The kidney cortex was separated from medulla and minced .
Cytosol of these tissues was prepared by homogenization in KETD-O0.3 with a Polytron ( Brinkmann ) and briefly centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min , and then the supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 105,000 x g for 1 hr .
All procedures for preparation of the cytosol fraction were carried out at 4°C or on ice .
Protein concentration was determined by the modified method of Lowry ( 13 ) .
Preparation of Subcellular Fractions .
After incubation and washes , PHA-activated PBMCs were disrupted by hypotonic lysis and homogenization , as described ( 10 ) .
The suspension of broken cells was centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 x g to separate the nuclear fraction from the supernatants .
The resultant supernatant was gently aspirated and then centrifuged for 60 min at 105,000 x g to separate the cytosolic fraction from the cell membranes .
Nuclei and membranes were washed twice in IPB buffer ( 0.01 M TrissHCl , pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA/0.5 mM EGTA/O.15 mM spermine/0.5 mM spermidine/5 mM dithiothreitol/0.32 M sucrose ) , resuspended in 0.3 ml of KETD-O0.3 , and sonicated .
Western Blot Analysis .
Crude cytosols or enriched preparations of the human intestinal VDR were electrophoresed on SDS/polyacrylamide gels ( 7.5 % or 10 % polyacrylamide ) as described by Laemmli ( 14 ) .
The proteins were then electro-phoretically transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membranes by using a TE42 Transphor apparatus ( Hoefer ) and 50 mM sodium phosphate transfer buffer cooled by a recircu-lator ( RMG Lauda , Brinkmann ) .
Complete transfer of all proteins was achieved by 3.5 hr at 20 V as shown by the lack of any staining in the 50- to 80-kDa range of the gels by Coomassie blue .
Upon completion of the transfer , the nitrocellulose membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis as follows : Membranes were incubated with PBS at pH 7.2 ( 0.02 M Na , HPO , , pH 7.2/0.15 M NaCl ) containing 3 % ( wt/vol ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , for 2-4 hr at 22°C , then transferred to PBS containing 1 % BSA and 9A7y antibody ( 2 ug/ml ) , and shaken overnight at 4°C .
Membranes were washed by gently shaking for 20 min at 22°C in 100 ml of TBS ( 0.01 M TrissHClI , pH 7.2/0.15 M NaCl ) containing 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 ; this step was repeated four times .
After a 2- to 4-hr preincubation in PBS/3 % BSA , the membranes were reincubated overnight at 4°C in PBS/1 % BSA containing the secondary antibody ( rabbit anti-rat IgG , 1:2000 dilution from 1 mg/ml ) .
The blot was then washed again as described above , preincubated in PBS/0.3 % BSA for 2-4 hr , and then incubated with radioiodinated protein A ( 0.21 LCi/ ml ) in PBS/1 % BSA for 3 hr at 22°C .
After washing , the membranes were dried and then autoradiographed at -70°C Proc .

Background was subtracted by setting the base line between the lanes of the gel at 0 .
RESULTS Representative findings from immunoblots of crude cytosol preparations from PBMCs using the anti-VDR monoclonal antibody 9A77 are illustrated in Fig .
1 .
As shown in Fig .
14 with a relatively short exposure ( 15 hr ) , we detected a protein band with an approximate migration position of 80 kDa .
This 80-kDa protein was present in the cytosol preparations of PBMCs that had been activated by a 72-hr incubation with the mitogenic lectin PHA or the OKT3 antibody to the T-cell receptor ( OKT3 ) ; however , this 80-kDa protein was absent in cytosols from PBMCs that had not been exposed to the activation agents .
The presence of this protein was confirmed in a large series of normal human activated PBMC samples ( n > 30 ) .
Unlike the 80-kDa species , which was readily recognized by the 9A77 anti-VDR antibody , we were able to detect a weaker band migrating at 50 kDa , the expected position of the VDR , only after a longer exposure ( 120 hr ) ( Fig .
18 ) .
The 50-kDa species comigrated with enriched preparations of human intestinal VDR .
Consistent with evidence from earlier binding studies ( 2 ) and similar to the 80-kDa protein , the 50-kDa lymphocyte VDR was absent from resting but present in activated cells .

Immunologic detection of the VDR and an 80-kDa protein in activated human lymphocytes by anti-VDR antibody .
PBMCs from a normal donor were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and incubated for 72 hr without stimuli or with PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) or with the antibody OKT3 ( 1:250 dilution ) .
Cells were then washed twice with PBS at pH 7.4 and sonicated , and the sonicate was centrifuged for 1 hr at 105,000 x g. Samples of the cytosol ( containing 100 ug of protein ) and an enriched preparation of the human intestinal VDR from transfected COS cells ( ~15 fmol of VDR ) were subjected to SDS/PAGE and then to immunoblot analysis .
The blots were incubated with PBS at pH 7.2 containing 1 % BSA and the 9A7y monoclonal antibody ( 2 ug/ml ! )
overnight at 4°C .
After washing with TBS containing 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , the blots were incubated with 1 % BSA/PBS at pH 7.2 containing the secondary antibody [ rabbit anti-rat IgG , 1:2000 dilution from a stock solution ( 1 mg/ml ) ] overnight at 4°C .
The blots were washed again and then incubated with radioiodinated protein A for 3 hr at 22°C .

To gain more information on this serendipitously discovered 80-kDa species , PBMCs from normal donors were activated with PHA , and the time course of the appearance of the protein and its localization in various cell fractions were determined .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the 80-kDa species was not detected 4 hr after lymphocyte activation but was detected 24 hr after activation , and its abundance appeared to increase in a time-dependent fashion over the next 48 hr .
In this and the subsequent experiments where , instead of 10 % gels , 7.5 % polyacrylamide gels were used to prepare the immunoblots , the 80-kDa species appeared as a doublet with the slower migrating band being predominant .
The faint band seen at 92.5 kDa in this and some of the later experiments was not a consistent finding , nor was this band regulated in any specific manner .
The 80-kDa doublet was localized in the cytosol of activated PBMCs , since immunoblots of proteins extracted from the membrane and nuclear fractions of the same cells lacked these bands ( Fig .
3 ) .
The 80-kDa species was not observed in membrane fractions of cells that had been activated by PHA from 0 to 72 hr , thus eliminating the possibility that the 80-kDa protein was expressed first in the membrane of activated lymphocytes and then translocated to the cytosol .
In parallel studies to those shown in Fig .
3 , the localization of the VDR in the same fractions was determined by using 1,25 ( PH ] ( OH ) ; D ; binding ( data not shown ) .
Unlike the 80-kDa species , binding of the ligand to its receptor ( determined by sucrose density centrifugation analysis ) was present exclusively in the nuclear fraction .
Results of studies to determine the cell-type specificity of the 80-kDa protein are illustrated in Fig .
4 .
The 80-kDa protein appears to be specific for activated lymphocytes since it was not detected in other VDR-bearing human cells such as the promyelocytic leukemic cells ( HL-60 ) , kidney cortex , brain tissue , and osteoblast-like cells ( SAOS-2 ) .
The 80-kDa protein was also not detected in normal peripheral blood monocytes and monocytes heated ( to express the heat-shock protein ) or activated with LPS .
The latter finding establishes clearly that the source of the protein in the experiments with mixed PBMCs ( i.e. , monocytes and lymphocytes ) is indeed the activated lymphocyte .
In addition , we examined whether 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; might influence the expression of either the 80-kDa protein or the 50-kDa VDR .
These studies were prompted by the observation that the ligand 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; upregulates its own receptor in the classical target tissues of the hormone ( 15-17 ) .
In these experiments , PBMCs from normal donors were activated with PHA or OKT3 in the presence of increasing concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( Fig .
5 ) .
As in the previous experiments , the 80-kDa protein was not detected in the resting lymphocytes but was readily detected in activated cells .
Nevertheless , in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , the 50-kDa band became apparent and was upregulated in a dose-dependent manner by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 5-fold increase at 10 nM ) in PHA 92.5 § `` 4 _j w # 69 Fig .

In contrast to the 50-kDa protein , however , the 80-kDa doublet was downregulated in a dose-dependent fashion by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 5-fold decrease at 10 nM ) .
Downregulation of the 80-kDa protein by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , was a consistent finding confirmed in more than 12 lymphocytes preparations from the various donors we have examined .
Moreover , the downregulatory effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on the 80-kDa doublet was independent of the mode of lymphocyte activation since it was present in both PHA- and OKT3-activated cells .

dihydroxyvitamin D ; had no effect on either band .
Estrogens also had no effect .
However , two potent immunosuppressive agents , the synthetic glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide and cyclosporin A , inhibited the expression of the 80-kDa doublet ( Fig .

Intriguingly , cyclosporin A , but not the synthetic glucocorticoid , appeared to upregulate the 50-kDa VDR .
DISCUSSION Activation of human and animal lymphocytes , in vitro and in vivo , leads to the expression of the VDR , and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; influences the immune function of these cells ( 1 ) .
The data presented in this report suggest another aspect of interaction between 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and lymphocytes .
Specifically , these data indicate that lymphocyte activation leads not only to the expression of the VDR but also to the appearance of a protein with the approximate molecular mass of 80 kDa that shares immunologic crossreactivity with the VDR since it was Fig .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) detected by the 9A77y monoclonal antibody , which was raised against the VDR .
This antibody recognizes a 17-amino acid epitope near the DNA binding domain of the VDR ( 18 ) .
We determined ( data not shown ) that a dilution of the 9A7y antibody as low as 1:10,000 can readily detect this lymphocyte protein on immunoblots .
Since no known mammalian protein of comparable molecular size contains a sequence with significant homology with the 17-amino acid epitope of the anti-VDR antibody ( determined by search of the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein data base on June 4 , 1991 ) , it appears that this protein has not been previously sequenced .
Intriguingly , however , the epitope recognized by this antibody contains a 7-amino acid stretch ( EEVQRKR ) that is identical to sequence present in the 50-kDa DNA binding subunit of the transcriptional activator NF- « B ( 19 ) .
We have internalized the 9A77 antibody into intact PBMCs and , using cytofluo-rometric analysis , have determined that expression of the epitope has a different time course than binding of 1,25 [ °H ] ( OH ) ; D ; to the VDR , which was determined earlier ( ref .
20 and data not shown ) , but is similar to the time course of the appearance of the 80-kDa protein , as determined by immunoblot analysis .
Thus it appears likely that the 9A7y antibody recognizes not only the denatured 80-kDa protein but also the native protein .
The identity of the 80-kDa protein and its role in the biology of lymphocytes are unknown .
Nevertheless , the strong immunologic crossreactivity between the VDR and the 80-kDa protein raises the possibility that these two proteins might be related .
Several pieces of evidence , however , argue against this possibility .
( ? )
There is evidence ( J. W. Pike , personal communication ) that the VDR is not comprised of multiple products either resulting from alternative processing or derived from mulitiple genes .
In addition , no clones were found that were partially related to the VDR during the screening of several chicken cDNA libraries and three human libraries from fibroblasts , the breast carcinoma line T47D , or monocytes ( J. W. Pike , personal communication ) .
( ii ) We amplified and sequenced cDNA from activated PBMCs by using primers that flank the DNA binding domain of the VDR ( 21 ) , which contains the antigenic epitope .
We found that the amplified sequence had an exact homology with the DNA-binding domain of the VDR sequence .
The fact that we were able to obtain an unambiguous sequence in those studies argues also against the possibility that there might be closely related mRNAs to the VDR mRNA in activated lymphocytes .
( iii ) Evidence against the relatedness of the two proteins comes from the present study that shows that the 80-kDa protein is absent from VDR-positive human cells other than activated lymphocytes .
More intriguing than the recognition of an activation-induced protein in lymphocytes with immunologic crossreactivity with the VDR is the observation that the former species is subject to regulation by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; as is the receptor itself , especially , since the downregulatory effect of the hormone on the 80-kDa protein is exactly opposite to the upregulatory effect of the ligand on its own receptor .
The inverse effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on these two proteins raise the possibility that a precursor-product relationship exists between the 80-kDa protein and the VDR .
However , the difference in the time course of their appearance , the 80-kDa being slower to appear , and the evidence that the regulation of the former is not associated with the regulation of the latter by glucocorticoids point away from the precursor-product relationship .
To our knowledge , the ability of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to upregulate its own receptor has not been previously demonstrated in lymphocytes .
However , hormone-induced upregulation of the VDR has been demonstrated ( 15-17 ) in the classical target tissues of the hormone .
Therefore , VDR upregulation Immunology : Yu et al .
by its ligand is a universal occurrence in both the classical and the more recently discovered target tissues .
The finding that other metabolites of vitamin D ; , with lower affinities for the VDR , failed to upregulate the receptor at concentrations comparable to that of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; suggests that this effect is mediated by the receptor itself , presumably through recognition of the regulatory elements of the VDR gene .
The similar specificity of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and other vitamin D metabolites on the downregulation of the 80-kDa protein also points to a regeptor-mediated mechanism .
This is particularly im-portant , since unlike previously reported effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on lymphocytes , such as the effects on interleukin 2 production and proliferation , both the regulation of the VDR and the 80-kDa protein were independent of the mode of lymphocyte activation .
Indeed , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; regulated both of these proteins in cells activated by PHA or by OKT3 .
As we have reported ( 1 ) , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; does not affect the proliferative response of OKT3-activated lymphocytes .
Hence , the downregulation of the 80-kDa protein by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; may be a primary effect and not the result of hormonal interference with lymphocyte proliferation .
Fur-thermore , the downregulation of the 80-kDa protein in OKT3-activated cells points away from the possibility that this protein is involved in lymphocyte proliferation .
Unlike the nonhormonal metabolites pf vitamin D ; and the steroid hormone 17B-estradiol , we have found evidence that glucocorticoids and cyclosporin A exerted a dqownregulatory effect on the 80-kDa protein , similar to the effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
The importance of these observations is , so far , unclear .
Nevertheless , since two steroid hormones with known immunoregulatory properties [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and glu-cocorticoids ] and a pharmacologic agent with strong immunosuppressive actions ( cyclosporin A ) ( 22 ) share this effect , it is tempting to speculate that the 80-kDa protein has an important role in immune phenomena .
This protein might also be a critical target for immunosuppressive therapies .
In conclusion , we have provided evidence for the existence of a protein in lymphocytes that is activation-induced , shares immunologic crossreactivity with the VDR , and is downregulated by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; as opposed to the VDR , which is upregulated by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
We believe that these studies add a link in the relationship between the vitamin D endocrine system and the immune system .
We expect that identification of the 80-kDa protein and its function in lymphocytes will provide better understanding of the role of vitamin D in immunoregulation .
