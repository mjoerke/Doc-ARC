Michael Bishop , December 31 , 1996 ABSTRACT The malignant cells of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) contain a reciprocal chromosomal translocation that fuses the promyelocytic leukemia gene ( PML ) with the retinoic acid receptor a gene ( RARa ) .
To test the hypothesis that the chimera PMLRARa plays a role in leukemogenesis , we expressed a PMLRARa cDNA in myeloid cells of transgenic mice .
PMLRARa transgenic mice exhibited impaired neutrophil maturation early in life , which progressed at a low frequency over the course of several months to overt APL .
Both the preleukemic state and the leukemia could be transplanted to nontransgenic mice , and the transplanted preleukemia could progress to APL .
The APL recapitulated features of the human disease , including a response to retinoic acid .
Retinoic acid caused the leukemic cells to differentiate in vitro and in vivo , eliciting remissions of both the preleukemic state and APL in mice .
Our results demonstrate that PMLRARa impairs neutrophil differentiation and initiates the development of APL .
The transgenic mice described here provide an apparently accurate model for human APL that includes clear evidence of tumor progression .
The model should be useful for exploring the molecular pathogenesis of APL and the mechanisms of the therapeutic response to retinoic acid , as well as for preclinical studies of therapeutic regimens .
The malignant cells of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) carry a reciprocal chromosomal translocation , t ( 15 ; 17 ) ( q24 ; q21 ) ( 1-3 ) .
The translocation fuses two genes ( 4 , 5 ) : RARa , which encodes the retinoic acid receptor « ( Rara ) ; and promelocytic leukemia ( PML ) , which encodes Pml , a nuclear phosphoprotein of unknown function ( 6 ) .
Prior to the identification of the genes at the t ( 15 ; 17 ) breakpoint , all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) had been shown to induce complete remission in APL patients by differentiation of the leukemic cells ( 7 , 8 ) .
This convergence of a novel therapeutic strategy and the molecular analysis of the translocation focused interest on how the resulting PMLRARa « and RARaPML fusion genes functioned in the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of APL .
The PMLRARa fusion encodes the bulk of both gene products .
PmlRara retains activities of both Pml and Rara , including transcriptional activation in response to retinoic acid , and can inhibit differentiation of cultured cells ( 5 , 9-18 ) .
In contrast , the coding domain of the reciprocal RARaPML fusion contains little of note and has not been shown to have any phenotypic effects .

2551 virtually all cases of APL , RARaPML is frequently not expressed ( 19 ) .
For these reasons it has been assumed that PMLRARa is responsible for the initiation of leukemogenesis , but this view has not been directly authenticated .
Here we report the establishment of a transgenic mouse model that documents the ability of PMLRARa to initiate leukemogenesis .
The mice develop two apparently unrelated abnormalities .
The first is a severe papillomatosis of the skin that we will describe elsewhere .
The second is a disturbance of hematopoiesis that presented as a partial block of differentiation in the neutrophil lineage of the transgenic mice and then progressed at low frequency to overt APL .
The leukemias appear to be a faithful reproduction of the human disease , including a therapeutic response to ATRA that reflects differentiation of the leukemic cells .
Both the preleukemic state and the overt leukemia can be transplanted into nontransgenic hosts .
The mouse model described here can be used to explore the pathogenesis and treatment of APL .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of Transgenic Mice .
A human PMLRARa cDNA ( 10 ) [ whose chromosome 15 breakpoint lies in breakpoint cluster region 1 as defined in Pandolfi 1992 ( 20 ) ] was cloned into the hMRPS8 expression cassette ( 21 ) .
Transgenic animals were prepared following standard procedures ( 22 ) from inbred FVB/N mice ( 23 ) .
Isolation of Cells from Tissues .
Blood was obtained from anesthetized animals by venipuncture of the retro-orbital venous plexus .
Bone marrow was obtained by flushing buffered saline through mouse long bones .
Tissues were suspended in buffered saline and filtered through nylon mesh .
Red cells were lysed as necessary ( 24 ) .
Blood and bone marrow smears and cytospins were prepared according to standard hemato-logical techniques .
Immunofluorescence .
Cytospins prepared as above were fixed for 5 min in -20°C methanol and air dried .
Samples were blocked for 15 min in PBS with 10 % normal goat serum ( PBS/NGS ) , and incubated for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal antiserum prepared against a glutathione S-transferase Pml fusion protein diluted 1:4000 in PBS/NGS ( the antiserum was a kind gift of K. S. Chang , M. D. Anderson Cancer Center , University of Texas ) .
Washing with PBS/NGS was followed by 30 min of incubation with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG ( Southern Biotechnology Associates ) at 1:400 in PBS/NGS .

medium ( Molecular Probes ) plus 1 wM 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Sigma ) .
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) .
Single cell suspensions prepared as above were stained with the indicated antibodies and analyzed on a FACScan Flow Cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Cells were incubated with mAbs for 20-30 min on ice , then allowed to settle through a calf serum cushion to remove unbound antibodies .
Cells were resuspended in staining medium ( buffered saline with 2 % fetal calf serum ) containing propidium iodide at 4 ug/ml .
At least 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample .
Dead cells that stained with propidium iodide were gated out at the time of analysis .
FACS data were analyzed with the CELLQUEST program ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Anti-Gr-1-fluorescein isothiocyanate and an-ti-MAC-1-phycoerythrin were obtained from PharMingen .
MethyIcellulose Cultures of Bone Marrow .
Duplicate cultures of 5 X 10 % viable bone marrow cells per 35-mm tissue culture dish were incubated for 7 days in Methocult M3230 methylcellulose medium ( Stem Cell Technologies , Vancouver , British Columbia ) supplemented with 2 % pokeweed mitogen spleen-conditioned media ( Stem Cell Technologies ) with or without 1 uM ATRA ( Sigma ) .
Western Blot Analysis .
Western blot analysis was performed as described ( 25 ) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing amino acids 420-462 of the human Rara protein ( 26 ) .
Before use , the antiserum was affinity purified with the analogous maltose binding protein fusion .
Transplantation of Leukemia .
Viable cells ( 10 ) isolated from bone marrow , spleen , or lymph nodes of animals with leukemia were resuspended in 200 pl of buffered saline and injected into the tail veins of 5- to 8-week-old FVB/N mice .
Transplantation of Bone Marrow .
Total bone marrow isolated from the tibiae and femurs of a single donor was divided for intravenous injection into six recipient mice .
Five- to 12-week-old FVB/N mice were prepared for transplantation by cesium irradiation totaling 10.5 Gray , divided in two doses 3-6 h apart .
ATRA Treatment .
At the indicated times after transplantation , ATRA was administered to mice via one of two routes : intraperitoneal injection of 100 wl of ATRA ( Sigma ) or ethanol vehicle suspended in canola or peanut oil at 54 mg/kg per day or subcutaneous implantation of a 21-day-release pellet containing 5 mg ATRA or placebo ( Innovative Research of America ) .
RESULTS Expression of PMLRARa in Transgenic Mice .
To examine the effect of PMLRARa « on granulocyte development , we created mice that expressed a human PMLRARa cDNA ( 10 ) from the AMRPS8 promoter cassette , which drives transgene expression in myeloid cells ( 21 ) .
Injections into FVB/N embryos yielded nine transgenic lines .
Levels of PMLRARa transgene expression in the bone marrow of transgenic mice varied from virtually undetectable to several-fold higher than NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells ( 4 , 27 ) ( Fig .
1a ) .
To determine which cells in the transgenic bone marrow expressed PMLRARa , bone marrow cells or peripheral blood leukocytes were analyzed by immu-nofluorescence using antiserum directed against human Pml .
PmlRara was distributed in a speckled nuclear pattern , consistent with previous reports ( 11 , 12 ) ( Fig .
14 ) .
Simultaneous staining with DAPI highlighted the distinctive indented , horse-shoe- or doughnut-shaped nuclei characteristic of murine granulocytes ( Fig .
le ) , verifying that the transgene was expressed in the granulocyte lineage .
In lines where transgene expression was undetectable by Western blot , very few cells were stained by the anti-Pml antibody ; in lines with high levels of expression , many more of the cells were stained ( data not Proc .

Neutrophil Maturation Is Impaired in PMLRARa Transgenic Mice .
When examined microscopically , the peripheral blood and bone marrow of PMLRARa « transgenic mice resembled the controls ( data not shown ) .
However , although neutrophilic cells from transgenic mice appeared morphologically normal , when we subjected cells isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow to FACS using markers for myeloid differentiation , subtle aberrations were apparent .
The transgenic samples displayed lower levels of the Gr-1 antigen ( 29 ) ( Fig .
2a ) , expression of which increases as neutrophils mature ( 30 ) .
The transgenic samples also had lower than normal levels of side-scatter ( Fig .
2b ) , reflecting a low cytoplasmic granu-larity , which is typical of immature granulocytes .
Both side-scatter and Gr-1 expression were inversely related to the level of transgene expression .
In contrast , levels of CD11b , a cell-surface marker that also increases with myeloid differentiation , were not diminished ( data not shown ) .
We examined at least five mice each from three transgenic lines ( 553 , 556 , and 565 ) , and the aberrations were consistent within each line , regardless of age .
Granulocytic cells from the transgenic mice therefore combined features of both immature and mature cells .
These data reveal that PMLRARa blocks some aspects of neutrophil maturation but not others .
For convenience , we refer to this condition as the `` preleukemic state . ''
PMLRARa Transgenic Mice Develop APL .
Twelve PMLRARa mice from five independent transgenic lines have developed APL when aged 3-9 months ( median , 174 days ) ( Table 1 ) .
Assessment of lifetime penetrance of the leukemia has been precluded by the epidermal papillomatosis , which occurs in varying degrees in all the mice and makes it difficult to maintain mice for a normal life span ( to be reported Medical Sciences : Brown et al .

elsewhere ) .
Nevertheless , it appears that penetrance of the leukemia may correlate with overall levels of transgene expression : although leukemias have been seen in lines with relatively low levels of PMLRARa expression , the disease has been more frequent in mice from the high-expressing 556 line ( Table 1 ) .
The leukemic mice were abnormally susceptible to bleeding after injections , and a few mice hemorrhaged spontaneously .
In some mice , fibrin thrombi were present in pulmonary blood vessels but not in other organs .
Peripheral blood counts were notable for anemia and thrombocytopenia in the absence of increased numbers of white blood cells ( 0.8-7.9 X 10° cells/ml in leukemias vs. 1.1-8.3 X 10° cells/ml in controls ) .
A bleeding diathesis in the presence of normal or even low white counts is typical of human APL ( 31 ) .
The pathology of the leukemia was consistent among the various transgenic lines .
Pale bone marrow was accompanied by lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly .
Microscopically , the mixed hematopoiesis of normal bone marrow was Table 1 .

completely replaced by leukemic cells , splenic and lymphatic architecture was effaced , and leukemia extended throughout the hepatic parenchyma .
In some cases , extensive invasion of the kidneys , reproductive organs , or the meninges was also observed .
Morphologically , the leukemic cells were promyelocytes ( Fig .
3b ) : they were large , had oval to indented nuclei and abundant basophilic cytoplasm with many primary granules .
Mitotic figures and dysplastic nuclei were present .
Although we have not observed Auer rods or faggot cells in these leukemias , both of which are characteristic of human APL ( 31 ) , we note that maturing human and murine granulocytes are morphologically distinct , and morphological variations might be expected between human and murine leukemias arising from this lineage .
Like human promyelocytic leukemia cells , the murine leukemia cells stained strongly with Sudan Black B ( data not shown ) , which marks the myeloperoxidase found in the primary granules of cells in the promyelocyte/ granulocyte lineage ( 32 ) .
The cells expressed low levels of Gr-1 and Mac-1 antigens ( Fig .
24 ) ; low expression of CD11b , the surface marker detected by the Mac-1 antibody , is characteristic of APL cells ( 33 ) .
In 7-day methylcellulose culture , leukemic bone marrow gave rise to abundant compact colo-nies .
Cytospins of cells isolated from these cultures principally contained promyelocytes ( Fig .
3¢c ) .
We conclude that the transgenic mice had developed APL .
Murine APL and the Preleukemic State Are Transplant-able .
To further verify the malignant character of the myeloid leukemia , we transplanted leukemic cells into unirradiated FVB/N mice .
We intravenously injected cells isolated from the bone marrow or spleen of leukemic donors .
To date , five leukemias have been tested with similar results : 3-5 weeks after transplantation , the recipient mice developed leukemia .

cells were identical to the donor cells When analyzed by immunofluorescence , samples from the transplant recipients stained intensely with anti-Pml antibodies ( data not shown ) .
Because the recipient mice did not carry the transgene , this verified that the leukemic cells themselves expressed PMLRARa .
We were also able to transplant the preleukemic state by injecting bone marrow from young , healthy transgenic mice into lethally irradiated FVB/N mice .
We have tested 6 of 45 recipient mice and all displayed marrow and blood FACS profiles characteristic of the transgenic line of the donor ( data not shown ) .
We have seen 9 cases of APL in the recipients to date .
These results demonstrated that the observed hemato-logical abnormalities were not a reaction to the papillomas , and provide the opportunity to define the incidence of leukemia and study tumor progression in a setting free of the epidermal disease .
Murine APL Differentiates in Response to ATRA in Vitro and in Vivo .
We wanted to determine whether the murine leukemia responded to ATRA like the human leukemia ; the ability to passage the leukemias enabled us to generate additional material for these studies .
When cultured for 7 days in the presence of ATRA , the compact colonies seen in untreated cultures were almost entirely replaced by colonies with an open , spreading appearance ( data not shown ) .
This suggested that ATRA was inducing differentiation , since mature neutrophils are mobile .
Cytospins of treated cultures chiefly consisted of mature neutrophils ( Fig .
34 ) .
These experiments demonstrated that the leukemic cells could be differentiated by ATRA treatment .
Next we examined the ATRA response in mice .
We first used a suspension of ATRA in oil for intraperitoneal injection .
The dose was calculated to approximate the blood levels achieved in human patients , with corrections for different route of administration and more rapid murine metabolism Proc .

ATRA and placebo injections were begun in four and two animals , respectively , on day 15 after transplantation , when promyelocytes were present in the peripheral circulation ; on day 21 after transplantation , injections were stopped and one mouse killed due to onset of vitamin A toxicity .
On day 28 , a moribund placebo-treated mouse and a healthy ATRA-treated mouse were killed and their bone marrows were analyzed by FACS .
Comparison of cells stained with Gr-1 and Mac-1 antibodies showed two main clusters of cells in the FVB/N control marrow ( Fig .
2¢c ) : nonmyeloid cells , negative for both markers , and maturing neutrophils , strongly positive for both markers .
In the placebo-treated mouse ( Fig .
24 ) , the bulk of the marrow was composed of leukemic cells expressing low levels of Gr-1 and Mac-1 .
ATRA treatment ( Fig .
22 ) restored a near-normal distribution of Gr-1 and Mac-1 staining .
The FACS changes were accompanied by the appearance of mature neutrophils in blood and bone marrow and by lessened hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in treated mice .
The two remaining ATRA-treated mice were monitored to examine their long-term response to therapy .
They continued in apparent remission until one relapsed 47 days after the end of treatment ( 68 days after transplantation ) , while the other remains in good health 7 months after transplantation .
Subsequently , we have subcutaneously implanted 21-day release pellets ( containing either 5 mg ATRA or placebo ) 10-20 days after transplantation .
These obviated the need for daily injections and did not lead to overdose .
In trials involving 6-12 animals each , we have tested recipients of transplants from 4 cases of leukemia , and have observed consistent responses to ATRA pellets .
Within 3-5 days of initiating treatment , increasing numbers of neutrophils appeared in the peripheral blood and bone marrow ( Fig .
3f ) .
The mice treated with the ATRA pellets generally did not survive much longer than those treated with placebos , but we suspect that their deaths were related to the pulse of differentiating neutrophils rather than to the leukemia itself , since maturing neutrophils were the predominant cell type in the peripheral blood and bone marrows of treated mice .
These adverse results of ATRA treatment may represent a murine version of the `` retinoic acid syndrome , '' which is thought to be related to the rapid expansion of the neutrophil population induced by differentiation of the leukemic cells ( 36 ) .
In addition to treating the leukemia with ATRA , we implanted ATRA or placebo pellets into transgenic mice that did not have leukemia .
The distribution of Gr-1 expression and side-scatter was shifted toward normal levels in five of five ATRA-treated transgenic mice , while control FVB/N were unaffected by the treatment ( Fig .
2 a and b ) .
It thus appears that the drug overcomes the preneoplastic changes as well as the acute leukemia , reinforcing the hypothesis that ATRA can correct abnormalities elicited by expression of PMLRARa in neutrophils .
DISCUSSION PMLRARa Impairs Neutrophil Differentiation .
We have shown that expression of a human PMLRARa cDNA in murine granulocyte precursor cells alters their differentiation and initiates the development of APL .
Some aspects of neutrophilic differentiation were sensitive to inhibition by PmlRara , others were not .
In particular , expression of the myeloid differentiation marker CD11b was not inhibited by PmlRara , in accord with a previous report in which PMLRARa was expressed in U937 cells ( 13 ) .
Our in vivo results confirm the hypothesis that expression of PMLRARa in otherwise normal granulocytic cells impairs their maturation , and define a preleukemic state elicited by PMLRARa .
It could be argued that the severe epidermal papillomatosis seen in the transgenic mice might have secondary effects that could account for a disturbance in granulopoiesis .
We do not Medical Sciences : Brown et al .
believe that this is the case : we have seen consistent FACS abnormalities in transgenic mice as young as 3 weeks , in the absence of visible skin lesions , and preleukemic marrow transplanted into nontransgenic mice retains its characteristic phenotypic abnormalities and propensity to develop APL PMLRARa Initiates APL .
In addition to the preneoplastic changes in granulopoiesis , hMRPS-PMLRARa transgenic mice develop acute leukemia .
We believe that expression of PMLRARa alone is not sufficient to cause leukemia because the leukemic phenotype combines incomplete penetrance with delayed onset .
While the epidermal papillomatosis has limited median survival in the most severely afflicted transgenic lines to 3-5 months , we suspect the incidence of leukemia in most of the transgenic lines may be only a few percent over the normal life span of the mice ( Table 1 ) .
However , results with a small number of bone marrow transplants suggest an incidence approaching 30 % at 1 year in the high expressing line 556 .
Initial results indicate that crossing transgenic lines 556 and 565 yields higher expression of the transgene and a greater incidence of leukemia , without changing the latency .
The 3- to 9-month latency of the disease , taken together with the low penetrance of leukemia , suggests that leukemogenesis by PMLRARa requires additional genetic changes .
Expression of PMLRARa may facilitate the acquisition of additional genetic changes .
Although the transgenic mice did not show a clear expansion of the myeloid compartment prior to the development of APL , increased proliferation might be balanced by increased destruction , the balance between differentiation and self-renewal might be altered , or genomic instability might be increased .
These mechanisms could enhance accumulation of mutations that further block differentiation , promote proliferation , or decrease apoptosis of the promyelocytic cells .
In collaboration with PmlRara , these genetic changes could then release promyelocytes from normal growth constraints , resulting in the uncontrolled proliferation of malignancy .
The Murine Leukemia Is an Accurate Model for Human APL .
We believe that the murine leukemia described here is a true analog of the human disease .
APL in both species shares the promyelocytic character of the leukemic cells and differentiation in response to ATRA ( with both therapeutic and adverse effects ) .
Our data further authenticate the role of PMLRARa in the specific pathogenesis of APL .
Also similar to human APL is the presence of a bleeding tendency in leukemic mice .
The etiology of bleeding in the mice remains uncertain , however , since we have not observed disseminated intravascular thrombi .
Other investigators have prepared mice in which transgenic PMLRARa is expressed by transcriptional controls for either the CD11b gene ( 37 ) or the human cathepsin G gene ( 38 ) .
The CD11b mice failed to develop either preleukemia or leukemia .
Their only apparent abnormality was an increased sensitivity to doses of irradiation that are normally sublethal , succumbing to infections because of protracted bone marrow suppression .
Thus , it is not immediately apparent that these mice offer any access to the pathogenesis of APL .
In contrast , the 24CG mice did display a preleukemic state that eventually progressed to overt leukemia , but they nevertheless differed in several substantive regards from the hMRP3 mice described in the present communication .
The leukemias in ACG mice were accompanied by elevated white blood cell counts and the persistence of maturing neutrophils in the bone marrow , and treatment with ATRA caused apoptosis rather than differentiation of the leukemic cells .
Several factors may figure in these differences .
The AMRPS gene is expressed more broadly in the myeloid lineage than hCG , which is restricted to promyelocytes and promonocytes ( 39 ) .
The hCG transgene may be down-regulated following ATRA treatment , while expression from the hAMRPS8 promoter is maintained during neutrophilic differentiation .
The genetic backgrounds of the Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 94 ( 1997 ) 2555 transgenic mice also differ , which could affect the response to PMLRARa expression : the hCG mice were made in ( C57BL/ 6 x C3H/He ) F » cross mice , whereas the hMRPS mice were made in inbred FVB/N mice .
In yet another experimental approach , an avian retrovirus was used to express PMLRARa « in chicken embryos ( 40 ) .
The result was an acute leukemia composed of multipotent blast cells , which were far less mature than the promyelocytes of APL ( 40 ) .
The blasts did not respond to ATRA , and their occurrence was associated with a consistent pair of mutations in the PML moiety of the fusion gene , mutations that have not been reported to occur in human patients .
While this system did reveal that PMLRARa has leukemogenic potential outside a promyelocytic context , the recurrent mutations and nonpro-myelocytic character of the leukemic blasts distinguish it from human APL .
The strong correspondence between human APL and the murine leukemia described here indicates that the hMRPS-PMLRARa system can be used to obtain information that is directly relevant to the human disease .
The transgenic mice provide a valuable tool for further exploring the mechanisms of PmlRara action , for isolating the additional genetic events that collaborate with PMLRARa to induce acute disease , and for exploring therapeutic approaches that may improve the survival of patients with APL and other leukemias .
