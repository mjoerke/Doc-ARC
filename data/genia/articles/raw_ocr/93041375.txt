Gruss , D. Riedel , R. Mertelsmann , and F. Herrmann '' Departments of Hematology and Oncology , University of Freiburg Medical Center , Hugstetter Strasse 55 , D-7800 Freiburg , Germany Abstract We report here that interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF- « B to its consensus sequence in the 5 regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor a chain ( p55 ) .
Similarly , IL-2 activates NF- « B in the human monocytic cell line U 937 , but not in resting human T-cells .
This effect is detectable within 15 min and peaks 1 h after exposure to IL-2 .
Enhanced NF- « B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor a chain is mediated by enhanced NF- « B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF- « B consensus sequence ( -291 to -245 ) of the IL-2 receptor a chain gene is activated .
In addition , IL-2 is capable of increasing transcript levels of the p50 gene coding for the p50 subunit of the NF- « B transcription factor , whereas mRNA levels of the p65 NF- « B gene remained unchanged .
Introduction The high affinity IL-2R® consists of a and 8 chains , but only the 8 chain participates in signaling of IL-2 ( 1 ) .
Molecular cloning and functional analysis of the IL-2R 8 chain have recently identified a small region of the cytoplasmic domain sufficient for signal transduction .
This region has also been postulated to represent an active site required for association with a second messenger in the signal transduction cascade and to potentially act via a phosphorylation signal ( 1 ) .
In lymphocytes , such a second messenger molecule interacting with the J chain was recently identified ( 2 ) .
Human blood monocytes constitutively express the IL-2R 8 chain ( p75 ) ( 3 ) , whereas expression of the IL-2R a chain ( p55 ) by human blood monocytes is inducible upon culture with IL-2 that can be further enhanced when IL-2 is combined with y-interferon ( 4 ) .

We have examined the nuclear basis of the action of IL-2 on IL-2R a chain expression .
Results Treatment of human PBMO is associated with IL-2R a chain expression by these cells ( 1 ) .
Whereas resting monocytes did not display transcripts for the a chain of the IL-2R by Northern blot analysis , treatment with IL-2 was associated with accumulation of IL-2R a chain transcripts ( data not shown ) .
To study the effect of IL-2 on the transcriptional activation of the IL-2R a chain gene , nuclear run-on assays were performed .
As expected from Northern blot data , resting monocytes constitutively transcribed only very low levels of the IL-2R a chain gene .
However , treatment of PBMO with IL-2 results in strong transcriptional activation of the IL-2R a chain gene ( Fig .
1 ) .
These data indicate that enhanced expression of the IL-2R a chain is at least in part due to transcriptional activation of this gene by IL-2 in PBMO .
The next set of experiments was designed to study the molecular mechanism mediating this transcriptional activation .
Deleted forms of the IL-2R a chain promoter were constructed ( Fig .
24 ) , linked to the hGH as a reporter , and transiently transfected into human monocytes .
Monocytes transfected with the p ( -317 ) IL-2R a promoter fragment responded to IL-2 with an approximately 8-fold increase in hGH activity ( Fig .
2B ) , whereas monocytes transfected with the p ( -225 ) IL-2R a promoter fragment failed to synthesize hGH upon IL-2 treat-ment .
In addition , various other deleted promoter constructs [ p ( -179 ) , p ( -141 ) , p ( -50 ) ] also did not respond to IL-2 with enhanced hGH release ( data not shown ) .
These data suggested that an IL-2-responsive element located between positions -317 and -225 is responsible for transcriptional activation of this gene in PBMO .
Recent studies have demonstrated that an enhancer element located at position -291 to -245 is crucial for activation of the IL-2R a chain promoter ( 5 , 6 ) .
The enhancer element was subcloned in front of the heterologous herpes thymidine kinase promoter , linked to the human growth hormone gene as a reporter .
This con-struct , termed p ( IL-R a ) TKGH , was transiently transfected into human monocytes , the human monocytic cell line U 937 , and resting human T-cells .
This IL-2R a chain construct responded to IL-2 in monocytes and U 937 cells , but not in T-cells , with an approximately 20-fold enhancement of hGH activity ( Fig .
3 ) .
Control experiments with a plasmid containing a mutant form of this enhancer p { IL-2R a mt ) TKGH or a control plasmid without this enhancer region ( pTKGH ) failed to display enhanced hGH activity in the presence or absence of IL-2 in cultures of transfectants ( Fig .
3 ) .
These data indicate that this region contains an IL-2-responsive element which is functional in monocytic cells but not in T-cells .

Effect of IL-2 ( 100 units/ml ; 4 h ) on the transcriptional rate of the IL-2R « chain gene in PBMO .
Cells were cultured for 4 h in the presence ( IL-2 ) or absence { medium ) of IL-2 .
In vitro transcribed , labeled RNA was hybridized to the IL-2R « chain gene ( /L-2R a ) , as a negative control to vector DNA ( vector ) , and as internal standardization to the actin gene { actin } .
EMSA assays were used to determine whether IL-2-induced nuclear factors could bind to a double stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to this region .
As shown in Fig .
4A , nuclear proteins from resting monocytes displayed a faint retarded band when incubated with this fragment .
Complex formation was enhanced when nuclear proteins from monocytes exposed to IL-2 for 15 min were analyzed .
Binding activity of this factor peaked after 30 to 60 min and returned to baseline levels within 2 h upon exposure to IL-2 .
Comparable results were obtained when the monocytic cell line U 937 was analyzed ( Fig .
4A ) , whereas resting T-cells displayed high constitutive binding of this factor as compared to resting monocytes , which were , however , only weakly , if at all , able to be enhanced by IL-2 ( Fig .
4A ) .
In addition , the IL-2-mediated induction of complex formation by monocytes was dose dependent and detectable in the range of 100 to 1000 units/ml of IL-2 .
No significant dose dependency was observed below 100 units/ml ( Fig .
4B ) .
Furthermore , treatment of monocytes with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 30 min prior to addition of IL-2 for 1 h did not interfere with IL-2-mediated induction of NF- « B binding activity ( data not shown ) .
The enhancer region ( position -291 to -245 ) contains a recognition site for the transcription factor NF- « B ( 6 , 7 ) .
Competition assays with a double stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence of the NF- « B transcription factor of the « B immunoglobulin gene were able to completely inhibit binding of monocyte- and T-cell-derived nuclear proteins , whereas an unrelated oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 consensus sequence did not interfere with complex formation ( Fig .
5A ) .
In addition , this competition assay also revealed that monocyte- and T-cell-derived nuclear proteins gave different patterns of retarded bands , indicating size heter-ogeneities of the proteins involved .
Therefore , the molecular size of NF- « B-binding proteins was analyzed by UV cross-linking experiments .
As shown in Fig .
5B , T-cell-derived proteins appeared to be 50 , 75 , and 85 kD in size , whereas monocyte-derived NF- « B protein was only 50 kD in size .
In additional experiments , EMSA were performed with nuclear proteins from untreated and IL-2-exposed monocytes and NF- « B protein purified from human placenta .
Purified p50 protein comigrated with the IL-2-inducible monocyte-derived nuclear factor .
In additional experiments , the effects of IL-2 on mRNA accumulation of the p50 gene coding for one binding subunit of NF- « B and the p65 gene coding for the IkB receptor-binding subunit were investigated ( 8 ) .
As shown in Fig .
6 , resting monocytes failed to display p50 mRNA on Northern blot analysis of total cytoplasmic RNA .
When , however , poly ( A ) selected RNA was used , a faint signal for p50 and p65 became detectable in resting monocytes ( data not shown ) .
Treatment of monocytes with IL-2 was associated with a significant increase of the 3.9-kilobase p50 mRNA levels at 12 h. Maximal levels were achieved by 24 h , whereas longer duration of IL-2 exposure ( 48 h ) caused down-regulation of p50 transcript levels .
In contrast , treatment with IL-2 did not alter transcript levels of the p65 gene during this time course ( data not shown ) .
Discussion NF-kB translocates into the nucleus following activation by a variety of stimuli such as active phorbol esters , the tax protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus 1 , double stranded RNA , interleukin 1 , or tumor necrosis factor a ( 9 ) .
We report here that IL-2 also has to be considered as a potent activator of NF-xB binding activity .
Moreover , our data indicate that expression of the B chain by monocytes is sufficient to allow IL-2 to dissociate the transcription factor NF- « B from its cytoplasmic inhibitor and generate binding activity of NF- « B to its consensus sequence within the IL-2R a chain promoter .
Enhanced binding activity of NF- « B to its recognition site translates into functional activation , in that a heterologous promoter containing the IL-2R a chain enhancer element is transcriptionally activated upon IL-2 treatment in human monocytes , whereas resting T-cells fail to respond to IL-2 with enhanced NF- « B binding activity or functional activation .
In addition , monocyte and T-cell-derived nuclear proteins that bind to the IL-2R a chain ( -291 to -245 ) differ not only in their inducibility by IL-2 , but also in their molecular size .
This observation might indicate that cell type-specific expression of distinct members of the NF- « B family mediates signal-dependent induction of this molecule .
In this context , recent work is of note demonstrating that inducible activities of different members of the NF- « B family are controlled by distinct mechanisms ( 10 ) .
Monocytes respond to IL-2 by releasing inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor a ( 11 , 12 ) and increased cytotoxicity ( 13 ) .
IL-2 was further found to induce monocytes to express several protooncogenes , including c-fos , c-myc , c-pim , and c-fms ( 14 , 15 ) .
The signal transduction pathway following binding of IL-2 to its surface binding sites , however , is presently unknown .
Recent reports have indicated that common signal transduction pathways such as protein kinase C translocation , calcium mobilization , and phosphatidylinositol turnover are not directly involved in IL-2 signal transduction ( 16-18 ) .
Our data , now for the first time , show that IL-2 is a potent activator of the signal transduction molecule NF-xB , even in the absence of functional high affinity IL-2R , and that exposure of monocytes to IL-2 also leads to accumulation of transcripts of the p50 gene coding for a DNA-binding subunit of NF- « B .
Transient increase of p50 transcripts , however , occurred after evidence for enhanced binding activity of NF- « B protein .

10007 750 500 250 T 1 75 100 Percent of NFKB Binding 25 50 A , time course for IL-2 induction of NF- « B enhancer-binding protein .
Nuclear extracts ( 10 ug ) prepared from blood monocytes , monocytic leukemia line U 937 , or T-cells , at the times indicated , were incubated with an oligonucleotide corresponding to position -291 to -245 of the IL-2R a chain and analyzed by EMSA .
B , dose-dependent effect of IL-2-induced NF- « B binding activity in monocytes .
Monocytes were exposed to 50 , 100 , 500 , and 1000 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 for 1 h. Complex formation was quantified using laser densitometry .
NF- « B binding activity achieved after 1 h of exposure to 1000 units/ml IL-2 was set as 100 % .
2-mediated activation of NF- « B was detectable in the presence of protein synthesis inhibition , suggesting that preexisting protein was activated by IL-2 .
Taken together , these results suggest that IL-2 is effective in regulating NF- « B by two independent mechanisms at two levels .
Alternatively , activation of NF- « B binding might be associated with autoinduction of the p50 gene .
Further studies are needed to clarify whether activation of NF- « B is also sufficient to mediate other effects than the expression of IL-2R a chain or whether the formation of the high affinity IL-2R engaging NF- « B is necessary to allow the initiation of other effects of IL-2 by human blood monocytes .
In this context , a recent study ( 19 ) is of note , indicating that the a chain primarily acts in order to facilitate the interaction of IL-2 with the B chain of the IL-2R , thereby increasing its affinity for IL-2 .
Materials and Methods Cell Separation .
Leukocyte preparations were obtained from buffy coats of blood donated by consenting healthy volunteers through the courtesy of the Blood Bank , University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany .
Monocytes were isolated as described previously ( 20 ) .
Briefly , buffy coats were diluted with minimum essential medium ( Seromed Biochrom , Berlin , Germany ) , washed , and centrifuged over a Ficoll-Hypaque cushion ( Seromed Biochrom ) .
In-terphase cells were then collected and subjected to two subsequent rosetting steps with aminoethylisothiouron-ium bromide-treated sheep red blood cells ( Flow Labo-ratories , Meckenheim , Germany ) for depletion of T-lym-phocytes , as described ( 20 ) .
Monocytes were further purified by two adherent steps of the E-rosette-negative cell fraction .
Monocytes obtained in this way were > 97 % pure , as assessed by a-naphthyl acetate esterase staining and - immunofluorescence analysis using anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody ( Becton Dickinson , Heidelberg , Germany ) .

- Induction of p50 mRNA by IL-2 in monocytes .
Monocytes were treated with 100 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 for 4 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h and harvested thereafter .
Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated , and 40 ug , RNA were hybridized to the p50 complementary DNA probe ( NF- « B ) .
Rehybridization with actin controls for comparable RNA loading in single lanes .
monocytes were harvested after the appropriate culture time as indicated .
Cells were resuspended in guanidine ( Sigma ) and extracted with an equal volume of acetate-EDTA-equilibrated phenol .
This mixture was incubated at 60°C for 25 min with frequent vortexing .
The aqueous phase was recovered after centrifugation and extracted once with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform and twice with chloroform .
The resulting RNA was precipitated overnight at -20°C with 2.5 volumes of ethanol .
The total RNA from each sample ( 40 ug ) was then elec-trophoresed in a 1 % agarose gel containing 20 mm sodium borate , pH 8.3 , 0.5 mm EDTA , and 3 % formalde-hyde .
The RNA was then transferred to nitrocellulose paper ( Schleicher and Schuell , Dassel , Germany ) in 10 % SSC { 1.5 m sodium chloride and 150 mm sodium citrate ) using capillary blotting overnight .
The blots were then backed and prehybridized at 65°C in 7 % SDS , 10 % Denhardt 's ( 1 % Denhardt 's = 0.2 % Ficoll , 0.2 % bovine serum albumin , and 0.02 % polyvinyl pyrolidine ) , 5x SSC , and 20 mm salmon sperm DNA ( Sigma ) .
The blots were probed with the EcoRl fragment of the pSP65 IL-2R a chain ( kindly provided by T. Waldman , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD ) , the Not !
fragment of pBKS-p50 { kindly provided by S. Ghosh , Whitehead Institute , Cam-bridge , MA ) , or the HindIl/Xbal fragment of pRe CMV-p65 ( kindly provided by P. Bauerle , Genzentrum , University of Munich , Martinsried , Germany ) radiolabeled by random priming with [ a- '' P ] JCTP ( > 6000 Ci/mmol ) ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
The blots were washed at 55°C in 1 % SDS-1 % x SSC and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film ( Eastman Kodak , Roch-ester , NY ) at -70°C with an intensifying screen .
For nuclear run-on assays , 10° cells were lysed in RSB [ 10 mm Tris-HCL-5 mm KCl-3 mm MgCl , containing 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 ( Sigma ) ] and washed once in ice-cold phos-phate-buffered saline .
Nuclei were incubated at 26°C in 15 % glycerol-70 mm KCI-2.5 mm MgCl ; -10 mm EDTA , 4 mm concentrations each of ATP , CTP , and GTP , 2 mm 426 Interleukin 2 Activation of NF-kB UTP , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol , 60 units/ml RNasin ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) in the presence of 100 LCi of [ P ] JUTP 3000 Ci/mmol ( Amersham Buchler , Braunschweig , Germany ) for 30 min .
The mixture was digested with DNase | and proteinase K , extracted once with trichloroacetic acid and phenol-chloroform , and precipitated in 70 % ethanol buffer before hybridization of 5 x 10° cpm/ml of hybridization buffer { 50 % form-amide-2x SSC-1x % SDS-5x Denhardt 's solution [ 1x Denhardt 's solution = 0.2 % Ficoll-0.02 % bovine serum albumin ( Fraction V ; Sigma ) -0.02 % polyvinyl pyrolidone ] -5 ug/ml tRNA } .
Filters contained 10 ug each of linearized plasmid immobilized on nitrocellulose ( Schleicher and Schuell ) .
After hybridization at 42°C for 3 days , filters were rinsed in 2 % SSC at 55°C , 2 % SSC containing 10 ug/ml RNase A at 37°C , and , finally , 0.5 % SSC at 55°C for 30 min each time , and were exposed to Kodak X-Omat films for 10 days .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay .
Nuclear proteins from untreated and IL-2-treated cells were prepared as described previously ( 21 ) .
A double stranded oligonucle-otide , corresponding to position -291 to -245 of the IL-2R a chain ( 6 ) , was synthesized and end labeled using the Klenow large fragment polymerase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Nuclear proteins ( 10 ug ) and labeled DNA ( 10,000 cpm ) were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid , 5 mm MgCl ; , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol , 0.5 mm EDTA , 1.0 ug polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid ( Sigma ) , and 12 % ( v/v ) glycerol at room temperature for 30 min .
Samples were then analyzed on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel ( Sigma ) .
The gel was dried and autoradiographed .
For competition assays , 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled synthetic double stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF- « B consensus sequence of the human « B immunoglobulin gene { ( ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCT ) or the AP-1 consensus sequence of the human collagenase gene ( GATCCCGCT-GAC TCATG ) was added prior to incubation .
For comi-gration experiments , NF- « B protein purified from human placenta ( kindly provided by P. Bauerle , Genzentrum , University of Munich , Martinsried , Germany ) was incubated with the end-labeled NF- « B oligonucleotide .
Preparation of Promoter Constructs and Transfection Assays .
The -317/+100 HindlIll/Kpni fragment of the IL-2R a chain promoter ( a kind gift of W. C. Greene , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD ) was blunt ended and subcloned into the Hincil site of pOGH ( 22 ) .
Deleted forms were made by restriction enzyme digestion of the Hind\II ! /Kpnl IL-2R « chain promoter fragment as follows : Xmnl yielding the p ( -225 ) fragment , Mnil , yielding p ( -179 ) , EcoRI , yielding p ( -141 ) , and EcoRIl , yielding p ( -50 ) IL-2R a chain promoter fragments .
The fragments were blunt ended and subcloned into the Hincll site of pOGH .
A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the -291 to -245 fragment of the IL-2R a chain promoter containing the wild-type NF- « B - recognition - sequence ( GGGGAATCTCCC ) or a mutant NF- « B recognition ( GCTCAATCTCCC ; mutated bases are underlined ) site were subcloned into the Hincll site of the pTKGH vector containing the heterologous herpes thymidine kinase promoter linked to the human growth hormone gene as a reporter gene ( 22 ) .
These constructs were termed p ( IL-2R a ) TKGH or p ( IL-2R a , mt ) TKGH , respectively .
Monocytes , U 937 cells , and T-cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran method ( 23 ) with p ( IL-2R e ) TKGH , p ( IL-2R a , mt ) TKGH , or the control plasmid pTKGH not containing the enhancer element , maintained in SCM for 24 h , and then cultured for an additional 24 h in SCM in the presence or absence of IL-2 ( 500 units/ml ) .
A B-galactosidase expression vector ( 24 ) was cotransfected to monitor transfection efficiency .
Human growth hormone activity was assessed in cell-free supernatants using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( Furogenetics N.V. , Tessen-derio , Belgium ) .
UV Cross-linking .
UV cross-linking was performed as previously described ( 25 ) .
Briefly , the IL-2R a chain oligonucleotide was body labeled with the Klenow large fragment polymerase ( Boehringer-Mannheim ) in the presence of 5 mm dGTP , 5 mm dATP ( Boehringer-Mann-heim ) , 5 mm 5'-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate ( Sigma ) , and [ « -P ] dCTP ( Amersham Buchler ) .
Nuclear proteins from IL-2-treated monocytes and T-lymphocytes were incubated with 100 fmol body-labeled oligonucleotide as described above and then subjected to UV irradiation ( 254 nm ) for 20 min at 4°C .
Proteins were separated under reducing conditions on a 12 % SDS gel .
A rainbow marker ( Amersham Buchler ) was used as a size marker .
The gel was dried and autoradiographed at -70°C using an intensifying screen .
