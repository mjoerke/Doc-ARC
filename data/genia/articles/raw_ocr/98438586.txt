Brief Definitive Report The Interleukin 2 Receptor a Chain/ CD25 Promoter Is a Target for Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells By Kai Schuh , * ThomasTwardzik , * Burkhard Kneitz , * Jorg Heyer , * Anneliese Schimpl , * and Edgar Serfling* From the * Institute of Pathology , and the *Institute of V irology and Immunobiology , University of Wiir burg D-97080 W iirz burg Germany Sum m ary The expression of the murine interleukin ( IL ) -2 receptor « chain/ CD25 is strongly induced at the transcriptional level after T cell activation .
We show here that nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) factors are involved in the control of CD25 promoter induction in T cells NFAT p and NF-AT e bind to two sites around positions -585 and -650 located upstream of the proximal CD25 promoter .
Immediately 3 ' from these NF-AT motifs , nonconsensus sites are located for the binding of AP- 1-like factors .
Mutations of sites that suppress NF-AT binding impair the induction and strong NF- AT p-mediated transactivation of the CD25 promoter in T cells .
In T lymphocytes from NF-ATp-deficient mice , the expression of CD25 is severely impaired , leading to a delayed IL-2 receptor expression after T cell receptor ( TCR ) CD3 stim-ulation .
O ur data indicate an important role for NF-AT in the faithful expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors and a close link between the TCR -mediated induction of IL-2 and IL-2 re ceptor « chain promoters , both of which are regulated by NF- AT factors .
Key words : T cells « NF-AT factors he high affinity IL-2 receptor consists of three individ- ual polypeptides , the « , B , and y chains .
Although the B and y chains are shared by other lymphokine receptors , the « chain ( CD25 ) is restricted to the IL-2 receptor , and is expressed by a variety of lymphoid cells ( for review see reference 1 ) .
The induction of CD25 in T cells is controlled at the transcriptional level through two DN A sequence ele-ments , a proximal promoter/ enhancer spanning the nucleotides between positions -54 and -584 in the mouse and -64 and -276 in humans , and a distal enhancer spanning ~80 nucleotides around position -1350 in the mouse and -3750 ( or -4150 , according to another nomenclature ) in the human CD25 gene ( 2-6 ) .
The activity of the promoter is rapidly induced by TCR -mediated signals or IL-1 , and is controlled by an array of transcription factors , in particular by nuclear factor Elf-1 , SRF , and HMG I ( Y ) .
The induction of the distal enhancer is controlled by IL-2 , which induces signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 5 , a member of the family of Stat transcription factors .
Stat5 binds in concert with Elf- 1 , HMG I ( Y ) , and GATA factors to multiple sites of the distal enhancer and The first two authors contributed equally to this paper .

Nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) factors comprise a family of transcription factors that contribute to the induced expression of numerous lymphokine and receptor genes in T cells Similar to NF- « B factors , the nuclear translocation and activity of NF-AT factors is stimulated by TCR -mediated signals ( for review see reference 7 ) .
The DNA-binding domains of NF-AT and R el factors share a common architecture ( 8 ) and , therefore , recognize overlapping DNA sequence motifs These common properties between NF-AT and NF-KB ( a major regulator of the CD25 promoter ) , and reports on the inhibition of CD25 expression by cyclosporin A ( 9 ) ( an inhibitor of phos-phatase calcineurin and , therefore , of nuclear translocation of NF- AT ; reference 7 ) , prompted us to investigate whether NF- AT factors participate in CD25 promoter control .
We show here that NF-AT p and NF-ATe bind to two sites located immediately upstream of the proximal CD25 promoter .
Mutations within the NF-AT sites that suppress NF-AT binding impair CD25 promoter induction .
Ac-cordingly , the induction of CD25 is markedly delayed in T cells from NF-AT p-deficient mice .
These findings implicate an important role for NF-AT factors in the inducible J. Exp .

Materials and Methods Cell Culture , Construction , and T rnsfection of CD25 Promoter Lu-dferase Plasmids .
_ Murine E4 T thymoma cells and human Jurkat T leukemia cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 5 % FCS .
2 X 10 '' cells were transfected using the DEAE dextran protocol with 2.5 ug DNA of the CD25 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs alone or 0.5-2.5 jug DN A of reporter constructs ( as indicated in the figure legends ) along with 2 ug of a pLGP3-based vector expressing full-length murine NF-ATp ( NF-AT1I-C ; reference 10 ) or an RSV-LTR vector expressing human NF-ATc .
Human 293 embryonic kidney cells were cultured in DMEM and transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol .
The luciferase reporter gene construct contains the wild-type murine CD25 promoter spanning the nucleotides up to position -2556 ( 4 ) .
Mutations in one or both of the NF-AT p binding sites around positions -585 and -650 were introduced into the promoter fragment from +1 to -800 using the QuikChange '' site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene Corp. , La Jolla , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The following oligonucleotides were used for the mutagenesis of NF- AT sites : ) ( 667 ) GCTAGACTTAAAATCTATCATTGCAGCTGTAAACAC ( -632 ) CGATCTGAATTTTAGATAGTAACGTCGACATTTGTG ; and ( ) ( -596 ) CCCACACCCATGATACTATGAATCGTGCATCAGAG ( -562 ) GGGTGAGGGTACTATGATACTTAGCACGTAGTCTC The underlined nucleotides indicate the mutations .
Immunofluorescenc and Flow Cytometry .
_ For Ab stainings , 2-8 % 10° cells were incubated on ice with mAbs at saturating concen-trations .
Fluorescein- and PE-labeled mAbs ( Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) were used for two- and three-color immunofluores cence .
For three-color flow cytometry , cells were stained first with biotinylated mAbs ( PharMingen ) for 15 min and were subsequently incubated with streptavidin-R ed '' ( GIBCO BRL , Eg-genstein , Germany ) and FITC- and PE-labeled mAbs for 15 min .
Results obtained after analysis on a FACScan® flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) using Lysys II software ( Becton Dickinson ) are shown as log dot-plots or histograms .
DN ase I Footprint Protection Assays and EMSAs .
In DNase I footprint protection assays , end-labeled DNA probes were prepared using [ y-*PJATP and polynucleotide kinase .
10¢ cpm ( ~0.2 ng ) of the following DNA fragments from the murine CD25 promoter ( 4 ) were used : ( a ) the HindIII-Sacll fragment spanning the nucleotides from position +94 to -268 ; and ( b ) the Sacll-Bglll fragment spanning the nucleotides from -268 to -801 .
Fragment ( a ) was recut with Espl , and fragment ( 6 ) with Dral generating DNA fragments of ~150-300 bp .
These were incubated for 60 min with a bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -NF-ATp protein ( 11 ) containing the DNA-binding domain of murine NF-AT p. The samples were processed and fractionated on 6 % polyacrylamide , 42 % urea-sequencing gels .
Electromobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed as previously described ( 11 ) , using 2 pg nuclear proteins and 0.5 ug poly [ d ( I-C ) ] .
In supershift EMSAs , 0.5 jg of either an NF-AT p-specific Ab ( Cat .

06-348 ; UBI ) or an NF-ATe-specific mAb ( 7A6 ) ( 12 ) were added to the incubations .
When the DNA binding of GST-NF-AT p was tested , 0.5-1.5 jg of bacterial proteins prepared by affinity column chromatography ( 11 ) were incubated along with 0.5 ug poly [ d ( I-C ) ] .
The following oligonucleotides were used as probes : 1370 ( iii ) ( -596 ) gateCCCACACCCATGGAACTATGAATCGTG ( -571 ) GGGTGTGGGTACCTTGATACTTAGCAC.ctag ; ( iv ) ( -663 ) gatcGACTTAAAATCTTCCATTGCAGCTGTA ( -635 ) CTGAATTTTAGAAGGTAACGTCGACATetag ; and ( v ) ( -667 ) GCTAGACTTAAAATCTTCCATTGCAGCTGTAAACAC ( -632 ) CGATCTGAATTTTAGAAGGTAACGTCGACATTTGTG The small letters indicate linker nucleotides .
Results and Discussion To determine whether the CD25 promoter is a target for NF-AT , we cotransfected a CD25 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene with NF-ATp- and NF-ATe-specific expression vectors into El4 T and 293 cells .
Treatment of 293 cells with TPA plus ionomycin ( T +1 ) led to a < 2-fold , and treatment of E4 cells with T+Con A led to an 8-9- fold , induction of activity of CD25 promoter spanning the nucleotides up to position -2556 ( 4 ) , and to a 12-fold induction of a shorter CD25 promoter reaching up to -800 .
Cotransfection of an NF-ATp expression vector into El4 cells resulted in a strong , 40-fold induction of activity of the longer CD25 promoter and in an up to 60-fold induction of the shorter CD25 promoter fragment after T+Con A treatment of cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Cotransfection with the NF-ATe vector gave rise to only a slight increase in promoter activity .
In 293 cells , the overexpression of both NF-AT factors resulted in a six- to ninefold increase in CD25 promoter activity ( Fig .
1 ) .
To demonstrate the binding of NF-ATp to the CD25 promoter , GST-NF-ATp encoding its DNA-binding domain was incubated with DNA fragments containing the first 800 bp of the promoter region in DNase I footprint 70 EL4 T cells 293 cells 60 4 50 g 6 ¥ 40 , 3 k-I4 ] Ret 30 ; € 20 { 7 ﬁféQai , F SASS BPs a ?

In lane 14 , a probe of the -610/-636 site was used as a control .
2 jg of nuclear proteins from unin-duced splenocytes ( - ) or splenocytes induced for 2 h with T+I ( + ) were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.5 ug NF-ATc- or NF-AT p-specific Abs , or in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of homologous unlabeled probes or distal IL-2 NF-for 16 h , and that of lanes 7-12 for 3 d.

A probe of the -639/ -658 site was incubated with 2 ug of nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells treated with T+I in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
For competition the following DN As were used : 5-50 ng of the cold -639/ -658 site and the distal IL-2 NF-AT site , or 10 and 50 ng of the proximal IL-2 octamer site ( 11 ) and a consensus AP-1 site .
In lanes 16 and 77 , 0.5 g of NF-AT-specific Abs were added .
In lanes 18-20 , a -632/ -667 probe mutated in the NF-AT site ( see oligonucleotide a in Materials and Methods ) was incubated without or with NF-AT-specific Abs .
protection assays .
Two prominent footprints were de-tected , spanning the nucleotides from -577 to -587 and -639 to -658 , respectively ( Fig .
2 A ) .
These comprise the NF-AT `` core '' binding sequence TGGAA ( 7 ) in opposite orientations ( Fig .
2 B ) .
When probes of these oligonucleotides were incubated with GST-NF-ATp in EMSAs , both probes were bound by NF-ATp , whereas a third probe spanning the unprotected nucleotides from -619 to -636 was unable to bind ( Fig .
2 C , lanes 13-15 ) .
U sing nuclear proteins from murine splenocytes , the generation of typical inducible NF-AT complexes was detected with the -639/ -658 probe ( Fig .
2 C , lanes 1-6 ) and , although far more weakly , with the -577/-587 probe ( Fig .
2 C , lanes 7-72 ) .
The generation of these complexes was enhanced after induction of cells with T+I ( lanes 1 , 2 , 7 , and 8 ) and efficiently competed with a 100-fold molar excess of the dis tal IL-2 NF-AT site ( Fig .
2 C , lanes 6 and 12 ) .
Moreover , the complexes were supershifted in EMSAs using NFAT p- and NF- AT e-specific Abs ( lanes 3 , 4 , 9 , and 10 ) .
The -639/ -658 site corresponds to a high-affinity NFAT binding site .
This could be seen best in EMSA compe- 1371 Schuh et al .
tition assays comparing the binding of NF-AT factors in nuclear protein preparations from T +I-induced Jurkat cells to this site and the distal NF-AT site of the murine IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
2 D ) .
Although 5-10 ng of the -639/ -658 site was sufficient to suppress almost all NF-AT binding , 10-50 ng of the distal IL-2 NF-AT site was necessary to see the same effect ( Fig .
2 D , lanes 6-11 ) .
50 ng of an AP-1 site was also able to suppress NF-AT complex formation , whereas the same amount of the upstream promoter site , i.e. , an efficient octamer but poor AP-1 site from the IL-2 promoter ( 11 ) , was without effect on factor binding ( Fig .
2 D , lanes 12-15 ) .
In contrast to the -639/ -658 site , the -577/ -5§87 NF- AT p binding site is a low-affinity NF- AT site ( Fig .
2 C , lanes 7-12 ; note that lanes 7-12 were exposed five times longer than lanes 7-6 ) .
To demonstrate a functional role for the two NF-ATp sites , we introduced mutations into the NF-AT motifs of each site , or into both sites , in the context of the 800-bp wild-type CD25 promoter fragment .
These mutations led to a loss of NF-AT binding in EMSAs using nuclear proteins from induced Jurkat cells ( see Fig .

- The NF-AT p sites contribute to the induction of CD25 promoter .
( A ) Mutations within the NF- AT p sites that suppress NF-AT binding interfere with the T+Con A-mediated CD25 promoter induction in El4 cells .

1+2 ) was transfected into E4 cells that were induced for 12 h. ( B ) Mutations of NF-AT sites suppress the NF-AT p-mediated transactivation of the CD25 promoter .
0.5 jug of the CD25 luciferase constructs was cotransfected with an NF-ATp expression vector into El4 cells that were stimulated for 12 h. To calculate the extent of induction , the activity of the CD25 wild-type promoter in nonstimulated cells was used as a reference point ( onefold ) .
or GST-NF-ATp ( data not shown ) .
When the mutated CD25 promoter/ luciferase constructs were transfected into E4 T cells alone or with an NF-ATp expression vector their induction was severely impaired compared with the wild-type promoter .
The T+Con A-mediated 16-fold induction of the 800-bp CD25 promoter fragment was almost abolished ( Fig .
3 A ) and its > 25-fold transactivation by NF-ATp was reduced to a 2-3-fold increase for the mutated promoter ( Fig .
3 B ) .
The importance of NF- AT p sites for the CD25 expression is underlined by defects in the CD25 surface expression on LN T cells fom NF-ATp-'- mice established in our laboratory ( 13 ) .
When LN T cells from wild-type mice were stimulated with plate-bound « -CD3 Abs for 2-24 h in vitro , a marked increase of CD25 surface expression was detected after 6-12 h , which became even more pronounced after 24 h. Due to the strong stimulation of the CD25 promoter by secreted IL-2 ( 2 ) , > 50 % of T cells express large amounts of CD25 48 h after stimulation ( Fig .
4 ) .
On NF-ATp- - LN T cells , CD25 expression was found to be distinctly delayed , becoming clearly detectable only 24 h after induction in spite of high , unimpaired IL-2 production of NF-ATp-'- T cells ( 13 ) .
In addition , fewer cells expressed high levels of CD25 after induction for 48 h ( Fig .
4 ) .
The two NF-ATp binding sites are located near the CD25 promoter and therefore appear to be involved in the rapid induction of the murine CD25 gene in resting T cells The core sequences of these sites TGGAA , differ slightly from the AGGAAAA core motifs of the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters and are the strongest NF- AT p binding sites in the human GM-CSF enhancer ( 14 ) .
As indicated in Fig .
2 B , 7-9 bp 3 ' to the NF-AT motifs are situated TPA-responsive element-like sequences that might allow the con 1372 certed binding of AP-1 and NF-AT .
In EMSAs we detected a specific binding of GST-c-Jun to both sites ( data not shown ) , but it remains to be shown which proteins of the AP- 1 family bind and regulate the CD25 promoter in vivo .
Finally , it should be pointed out that several properties of NF-ATp-~'~- mice , such as the impaired clonal deletion of T cells and expansion of lymphoid organs ( 13 , 15 , 16 ) , are shared by the mice deficient for IL-2 and IL-2 receptors ( 17-19 ) .
We assume that the impaired CD25 expression might contribute to the development of this phenotype in NF-ATp-~ ~ mice , which is reminiscent of other mice with defects in the IL-2 signaling system .
