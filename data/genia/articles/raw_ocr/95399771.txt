Regulation of Granulocyte- Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor and E-Selectin Expression in Endothelial Cells by Cyclosporin A and the T-Cell Transcription Factor NFAT By Gillian W. Cockerill , Andrew G. Bert , Gregory R. Ryan , Jennifer R. Gamble , Mathew A. Vadas , and Peter N. Cockerill Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) was originally described as a T-cell-specific transcription factor that supported the activation of cytokine gene expression and mediated the immunoregulatory effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
As we observed that activated endothelial celis also expressed NFAT , we tested the antiinflammatory properties of CsA in endothelial cells .
Significantly , CsA completely suppressed the induction of NFAT in endothelial cells and inhibited the activity of granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene regulatory elements that use NFAT by 60 % .
CsA similarly mediated a reduction of up to 65 % in GM-CSF mRNA and protein expression in activated endothelial cells .
CsA also suppressed E-selectin , but not vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) expression in HE REGULATION of cytokine gene expression is central to the regulation of the immune response . '' ''
The T cell has been the most intensively studied model system for investigating cytokine gene regulation , as a wide variety of cytokines are induced on activation of the T-cell receptor . ''
The transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) * plays a key role in the activation of many of these genes and is itself induced on T-cell receptor activation .
The induction of cytokines such as interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and granulocyte-macrophage - colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) in T cells can be suppressed by cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , and these effects are largely caused by the ability of CsA to inhibit activation of NFAT .
'***~ Furthermore , the immunosuppressive actions of CsA have been widely attributed to its ability to suppress T-cell expression of cytokines such as IL-2 , and bence T-cell activation and proliferation .
NFAT , initially thought to be a T-cell specific factor , typically consists of a complex of AP-l family proteins and NFATp or NFATc , which are respectively induced via protein kinase C and Ca** signals originating from T-cell receptor activation.® '' '' NFATp and NFATc are related proteins* '' that are expressed in the cytoplasm of T cells and translocate to the nucleus in response to the Ca** activation of the CsA-inhibitible phosphatase calcineurin .
** '' '' '' Hence , NFATp and NFATc are major targets for the actions of CsA in T cells .
The genes for NFATp and NFATc have recently been cloned '' and it is now believed that NFATc is largely restricted to lymphoid tissues , while NFATp expression is more widespread .
NFAT contributes to the activation of the GM-CSF locus in T cells by interacting with four strong binding sites in an upstream enhancer® '' and two weak binding sites in the GM-CSF promoter . ''
However , GM-CSF is also expressed at sites of inflammation in many cell types other than T cells. > '' This raises the possibility that induction of GM-CSF expression in these cell types could also require NFAT .
Consequently , the GM-CSF locus may also be a target for CsA in cells such as activated endothelial cells that express GM-CSF .
The endothelial cell represents the interface between the Blood , Vol 86 , No 7 ( October 1 ) , 1995 : pp 2689-2698 endothelial cells , even though the E-selectin promoter is activated by NF- « B rather than NFAT .
Hence , induction of cell surface expression of this leukocyte adhesion molecule by tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -a was reduced by 40 % in the presence of CsA , and this was reflected by a 29 % decrease in neutrophil adhesion .
The effects of CsA on endothelial cells were also detected at the chromatin structure level , as DNase !
hypersensitive sites within both the GM-CSF enhancer and the E-selectin promoter were suppressed by CsA .
This represents the first report of NFAT in endothelial cells and suggests mechanisms by which CsA could function as an antiinflammatory agent .

On activation , endothelial cells produce numerous cytokines , including GM-CSF , which activate immune response effector cells such as neutrophils , monocytes , basophils , and eosino-phils . ''
Furthermore , GM-CSF may be one of the mediators of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions suck as rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , and psoriasis . ''
GM-CSF is typically induced in endothelial cells by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) and IL-1 and its expression is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . '' ''
Agents that activate the protein kinase C and Ca** pathways in endothelial cells would also be expected to induce GM-CSF expression .
In addition to producing cytokines , activated endothelial cells also express the cell surface adhesion molecules E-selectin , P-selectin , vascular cell adhesion molecule-l ( VCAM-1 ) , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , which mediate recruitment and transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium .

2690 sively on endothelial cells that interacts with receptors on a subset of leukocytes that include neutrophils , eosinophils , monocytes , and a subset of memory T cells . ''
E-selectin is involved in the earliest stages of leukocyte recruitment as it mediates the initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes across the endothelium . ''
Acute and chronic inflammatory conditions are typically maintained by the activation of both cytokines and adhesion molecules that function in concert to orchestrate the interactions between numerous participating cell types .
Elevated expression of E-selectin , for example , is associated with inflammatory conditions such as asthma , '' ' rheumatoid arthri-tis , '' and psoriasis . ''
While CsA is more commonly used as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent organ transplant rejection , it has also been found to be effective in the treatment of a variety of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis , '' asthma , '' ulcerative colitis , '' and rheumatoid arthritis . ''
While some of the benefits of these treatments can be attributed to actions against T cells , there may be additional direct effects on either the activation or trafficking of cell types such as neutrophils , eosinophils , and monocytes .
To gain a better understanding of the involvement of the endothelium in inflammation , we have investigated the regulation of the GM-CSF and E-selectin genes in endothelial cells .
For this purpose we have used passaged human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEs ) and the recently derived endothelial cell line C11STH .
** We initially cloned C11STH cells from a spontaneous transformant that arose in a culture of HUVEs and showed that they have a repertoire of adhesion molecules and TNF-a receptors similar to that found in normal HUVEs . ''
In this study we found that , as in T cells , the GM-CSF enhancer was required for efficient activation of the GM-CSF promoter in endothelial cells .
Interestingly , these effects appeared to be mediated in part by the transcription factor NFAT .
Furthermore , NFAT and GM-CSF induction in endothelial cells was suppressed by CsA .
The induction of E-selectin in endothelial cells and acquired ability to support neutrophil adhesion were also inhibited by CsA , suggesting a wider role for this drug in combating inflammation .
In the course of these studies we established that the endothelial cell line C11STH '' is a valuable model system for studying inflammatory events in the endothelium .

RESULTS Activated endothelial cells express NFAT .
CsA is a potent immunosuppressive drug known to function in T cells by inhibiting induction of the transcription factor NFAT .
Although there have been no previous reports of NFAT in endothelial cells , CsA is used as an antiinflammatory agent , and some of its actions could be mediated by suppression of factors in the endothelium .
Therefore , we have examined whether NFAT can be induced in endothelial cells by pathways known to activate NFAT in T cells .
To this end , we stimulated C11STH cells and passaged HUVEs with a combination of the phorbol ester PMA and the calcium ionophore A23187 .
These signals mimic the phospholipase C driven activation of protein kinase C and increase in cytosolic Ca** and induce the AP-1 and NFATp/c components of NFAT , respectively .
We performed gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts prepared from activated HUVEs and C11STH cells using the GM-CSF enhancer GM43O0 sequence as a probe for NFATp/c binding ( lefthand panel in Fig 1 ) and the human IL-2 gene distal NFAT site as a probe for NFAT ( righthand panel in Fig 1 ) .
The IL-2 site served as the prototypic NFAT site most commonly used to assay for the presence of NFAT in T cells as it cooperatively binds AP-1 and NFATp/c to form NFAT complexes . ''
The GM430 site is a high-affinity NFATp site that is able to associate strongly with the NFATp/c component of NFAT independently of AP-1 .
Significantly , nuclear extracts from HUVEs and C11STH cells both formed inducible NFATp/c-like complexes with the GM430 element and NFAT-like complexes with the IL- 2691 2 NFAT site that comigrated with Jurkat T-cell complexes in gel mobility shift assays ( Fig 1 ) .
As in T cells , CsA completely inhibited the induction of these endothelial cell NFAT and NFATp/c-like complexes ( Fig 1 ) .
Furthermore , complex formation with both probes was completely inhibited when either the IL-2 or GM430 NFAT elements were included as DNA competitors , but only partially inhibited when an unrelated competitor ( X ) was used .
NFATp appeared to be the major protein contributing to NFATp/c-like complexes with the GM430 probe in C11STH and HUVE extracts as antibodies raised against either recombinant NFAT p or to an NFAT p peptide specifically inhibited formation of or super-shifted NFATp-like complexes as efficiently as they did with Jurkat cell extracts ( Fig 2 ) .
Addition of a 5- to 20-fold greater amount of oct-1 antiserum had little effect on NFATp complex formation with the endothelial cell nuclear extracts .
As the 67.1 NFATp antibody was raised against a peptide not conserved in NFATc , there appeared to be little or no NFAT ' c present in either the endothelial cell or the Jurkat cell extracts employed in this study .
NFATp induction in endothelial cells may require a Ca** signal not provided by proinflammatory cytokines , as TNF-a did not induce NFAT p ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , TNF-a was a more efficient inducer of NF-KB in endothelial cells than PMA and A23187 ( data not shown ) .
GM-CSF expression is regulated by CsA in endothelial cells .
If NFATp regulates gene expression in endothelial cells then GM-CSF gene activation via Ca* '' * pathways in endothelial cells should also be CsA-sensitive .
To explore this possibility , we examined GM-CSF synthesis in four independent lines of passaged HUVEs .
As in T cells , the level of GM-CSF secretion by HUVEs was increased 100-fold by the combined actions of the phorbol ester PMA and the calcium ionophore A23187 ( PMA/I , Fig 3 ) .
For each of the four lines of activated HUVEs , there was a decrease in GM-CSF expression in the presence of 0.1 pmol/L CsA , with an average reduction of 50 % .
As we anticipated that CsA would inhibit GM-CSF at the transcriptional level , we also performed RNase protection assays of GM-CSF mRNA in HUVEs and C11STH cells .
Just as we observed for GM-CSF protein synthesis , GM-CSF mRNA was strongly induced in both HUVEs and C11STH cells by PMA and A23187 ( Fig 4 ) .
GM-CSF mRNA induction required calcium ionophore as well PMA , as sixfold less GM-CSF mRNA was detected in the presence of PMA alone .
In the presence of 0.1 gmoV/L CsA the induction of GM-CSF mRNA was reduced by 65 % in HUVEs and 56 % in C11STH cells ( Fig 4 ) .
This inhibition appeared to be specific , as we observed no effect of CsA on IL-8 expression in endothelial cells ( data not shown ) .
CsA also appeared to have little effect on induction of GM-CSF expression by pathways that do not use Ca** .
Hence , CsA had no significant influence on induction of GM-CSF mRNA or protein expression in endothelial cells activated with TNF-a ( data not shown ) .
The GM-CSF enhancer exists as a DNasel hypersensitive site in endothelial cells .
- In T cells , the GM-CSF enhancer exists as an inducible CsA-sensitive DNaselI hypersensitive ( DH ) site that spans at least two NFAT sites . '' ''

Each assay used 5 ug protein , and the asterisk indicates one lane where a shorter autoradiographic exposure was included to assist identification of the NFATp complex in the Jurkat extract .
tas ts peared as a constitutive site in both C11STH cells ( Fig 5A ) and HUVEs ( Fig 5B ) .
Although not detected in Jurkat T cells , this site also appeared as a DH site in activated T lymphocytes ( Fig 5B ) .
The DH site within the enhancer appeared as a weak site before activation and was strongly induced in the presence of the coactivators PMA and A23187 in both C11STH cells and HUVEs .
The DH site existed as a broad region 2.8 to 3.0 kb upstream of the GM-CSF gene , thus resembling the DH site induced in T cells .
Significantly , induction of this DH site was reduced by about 70 % in the presence of 0.1 mol/L CsA , which had no effect on the promoter DH site ( Fig 5A ) .
We also examined endothelial cells activated by TNF-a , but observed that this cytokine was not a significant inducer of any DH sites within the GM-CSF locus ( data not shown ) .
The GM-CSF enhancer contributes to GM-CSF activation in endothelial cells .
To determine whether the upstream enhancer was required for efficient GM-CSF promoter activation in endothelial cells , the enhancer was coupled to the GM-CSF promoter in a luciferase reporter gene plasmid .
On transfection into C11STH cells and stimulation with the coactivators PMA and A23187 , the enhancer supported a fivefold greater induction of luciferase gene expression than was obtained with a luciferase gene driven by the GM-CSF promoter alone ( Fig 6 ) .
Furthermore , this induction was suppressed by about 60 % in the presence of CsA .
CsA inhibits neutrophil adhesion to activated endothelial cells .
- Having found that CsA could suppress cytokine gene expression , we next examined whether CsA could influence neutrophil adhesion to activated endothelial cells .
Neutrophils become involved at the earliest stages during the progression of inflammation and are also one of the cell types activated by GM-CSF .
In the presence of TNF-a , we observed an approximately sixfold increase in the adherence of neutrophils to a confluent monolayer of C11STH cells ( Table 1 ) .
In the presence of CsA , we observed a 29 % decrease ( P = .0006 ) in the TNF-a-induced neutrophil adherence .

- Suppression of GM-CSF protein synthesis in HUVEs by CsA .
Levels of GM-CSF secretion by cultured HUVEs were measured by ELISA .
Four independent lines of HUVEs were either not stimulated ( NIL ) or stimulated for 16 hours with 20 ng/mL PMA and 2 umol/L A23187 in the presence ( PIC ) or absence ( Pl ) of 0.1 umol/L CsA .
Shown above are the mean expression levels obtained with the four lines of HUVEs together with error bars indicating the SEM .
There was a statistically significant mean decrease of 320 pg/mL GM-CSF ( SEM = 132 , P < .01 ) in the four lines of HUVEs in the presence of CsA .
E-selectin expression is suppressed by CsA in endothelial cells .
To determine which leukocyte adhesion molecules on endothelial cells might be suppressed by CsA , we examined the regulation of E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression in C11STH cells .
E-selectin can interact with receptors on neutrophils , eosinophils , monocytes , and subsets of T cells and is an important regulator of both acute and chronic in-flammation .
`` `` '' * VCAM-1 plays a major role in the adherence of monocytes and lymphocytes to endothelial cells . ''
We first showed that E-selectin was induced in C11STH cells in the expected fashion by either TNF-a or a combination of PMA and A23187 ( PMA/I ) ( Fig 7 ) .
IFN-y alone was unable to induce E-selectin expression , but greatly enhanced its activation by TNF-a .
We also observed that the cAMP inducer forskolin was a potent inhibitor of TNF- « -inducible E-selectin expression in C11STH cells , as previously observed by others in HUVEs . ''
On inclusion of increasing amounts of CsA , we observed up to a 40 % decrease in the cell surface expression of E-selectin expression in C1 1STH cells activated by either TNF- « , TNF-a plus IFN , or PMA and A23187 ( Fig 7 ) .
CsA reduced the expression obtained with PMA and A23187 to a level equivalent to that obtained with PMA alone .
Furthermore , activation of E-selectin expression in the presence of PMA alone was essentially resistant to the effects of CsA .
2693 Interestingly , CsA also did not suppress the component of TNF-a-inducible E-selectin expression that was resistant to forskolin .
The effects of CsA on E-selectin expression appeared to be specific , as CsA had no effect on the induction of VCAM-1 expression by any of the above agents ( data not shown ) .
A CsA-sensitive DNasel hypersensitive site exists in the E-selectin promoter .
_ To search for regulatory elements that might account for the CsA-sensitivity of E-selectin gene expression , we screened the E-selectin locus for CsA-sensitive DH sites .
For this purpose we reprobed the filter used in Fig 5 with an intragenic E-selectin probe .
DNaselI digestion of the E-selectin chromosomal locus produced additional 3.0- and 6.5-kb subfragments of the 9-kb EcoRI fragment , indicating that two DH sites existed upstream of the E-selectin gene in activated endothelial cells ( Fig 8 ) .
One DH site near the origin of transcription was induced by either TNF-a or a combination of PMA and A23187 in both C11STH cells ( Fig 8A ) and HUVEs ( Fig 8B ) and has also recently been detected by others . '' ''
The second DH site , located 3.5 kb upstream , appeared as a constitutive DH site .
Significantly , the inducible but not the constitutive site , was suppressed by CsA ( Fig 8A ) , suggesting that CsA-sensitive transcriptional activation ele- [ HUVE C11-STH 1 I I < 3 3 0 0 4 m & m I 3 - _- o 8 n s gg lg $ s 6 z E E E 1 E & F - GM-CSF d § 1 o Ge .

Both DH sites appeared to be endothelial cell specific as they did not appear in activated Jurkat cells or T cells ( Fig 8B ) or in a wide range of other cell types examined ( data not shown ) .
CsA may suppress NF-KB activity in the E-selectin promoter .
We examined the sequence of the E-selectin promoter seeking transcription factor binding sites that might be involved in DH site formation and be suppressed by CsA .
Previous studies of E-selectin gene regulation have implicated an array of three NF-KB sites in the promoter as being crucial for activation of E-selectin expression , '' and these sites may be the most likely targets for the actions of CsA in this locus .
Indeed , there is some evidence that NF-kB p50 and c-rel expression is inhibitible by either CsA or FK506 , *5** which might account for the 40 % inhibition of E-selectin expression that occurs in the presence of CsA .
Nevertheless , there is also evidence obtained with T cells that NFAT-like factors can in some cases associate with NF-kB-like regulatory regions . ''
To determine whether NFAT or NF-kB proteins are more likely to account for the CsA-sensitivity of E-selectin expression , we examined binding of recombinant NFATp , NF-kB COCKERILL ET AL GM-CSF PROMOTER + ENHANCER 100 1 p E ag 6 715 | < E , ® so | G 3 GM-CSF m PROMOTER 2A 2s | 5 2 € NIL PMA PMA I I I I CsA CsA NIL PMA PMA Fig 6 .

This particular E-selectin NF-KB site was the most proximal of the three NF-KB sites in the promoter and the one found to be the most essential for E-selectin promoter activity .
As this element encompasses the sequence AGAGGAAA , it is also the E-selectin NF-KB site that most resembles binding sites for NFATp.®° As anticipated from earlier studies of T-cell nuclear ex-tracts , '' both the IL-2 NFAT site and the Igk NF- « B site had the capacity to associate with all three proteins .

2696 many early inflammatory events , and CsA , which is in widespread use as an immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory drug .
Two important classes of molecules that are activated during the early stages of inflammation are the cytokines and adhesion molecules that direct the activation and trafficking of leukocytes that enter inflammatory lesions .
We have concentrated on GM-CSF and E-selectin as potential targets for antiinflammatory actions of CsA in endothelial cells , and these are two molecules that might function in concert on neutrophils and eosinophils .
Surprisingly , we discovered that immunoregulatory mechanisms initially thought to be restricted to lymphoid cells also operated in endothelial cells .
Hence , the T-cell transcription factor NFAT was induced in endothelial cells by pathways that in T cells are triggered by T-cell receptor and phospholipase C activation .
CsA , an immunosuppressant previously thought to function primarily by inhibiting induction of NFAT and cytokine gene expression in T cells , also inhibited activation of NFAT in endothelial cells .
The endothelial cell NFAT complexes were found to contain the protein NFATp , which has recently been reported to be expressed in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells , '' rather than NFATc , which is thought to be lymphoid-spe-cific .
Although there are few previous reports suggesting functions for NFAT outside of the T-cell lineage , a recent study has implicated NFAT as a factor required for TNF-a gene expression in B cells . ''
Other studies have demonstrated that ligation of surface immunoglobulin results in CsA-sensitive induction of NFAT and activation of NFAT -responsive reporter genes in B cells . ''
GM-CSF is a proinflammatory cytokine having the potential to activate neutrophils , monocytes , and eosinophils .
Of all the cytokines that can be expressed by endothelial cells , GM-CSF is perhaps the only one strongly inhibited by CsA in T cells .
Therefore , we have explored the potential of CsA to act as an antiinflammatory agent working to suppress activation of myeloid cells by GM-CSF .
We observed that CsA suppressed the Ca**-mediated activation of GM-CSF protein expression in endothelial cells by 50 % and GM-CSF mRNA expression by approximately 60 % .
To determine the molecular basis for the regulation of GM-CSF expression in endothelial cells , we examined the functions of regulatory elements within the GM-CSF locus .
Previous studies in T cells suggested that GM-CSF gene activation is mediated to a large extent by binding of NFAT to the upstream enhancer , *° and binding of NFAT , AP-1 , and NF- « B to the promoter . ''
In this study we found that the upstream enhancer was also required for efficient activation of the GM-CSF promoter in transfected endothelial cells , and that the activity of the promoter and enhancer was suppressed twofold in the presence of CsA .
As seen previously in T cells , stimulation with PMA and A23187 led to chromatin structure changes within the enhancer that were suppressed by CsA .
These observations may suggest a direct role for NFAT in the induction of the GM-CSF enhancer in endothelial cells .
In contrast to T cells , endothelial cells appeared to have only a partial dependence on NFAT for induction of GM-CSF expression .
Although CsA completely suppressed in COCKERILL ET AL duction of NFAT , it only partially suppressed the GM-CSF promoter and enhancer and GM-CSF mRNA and protein expression in endothelial cells .
In T cells , CsA essentially eliminates GM-CSF gene expression . ''
Furthermore , TNF-a was a potent inducer of NF- « B and GM-CSF expression in endothelial cells , but was a poor activator of NFAT and an inefficient inducer of the DH site in the enhancer ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , it is likely that TNF-a induces GM-CSF expression by using factors that activate the promoter in the absence of NFAT .
Interestingly , the GM-CSF promoter existed as a constitutive DH site in endothelial cells ( Fig 5 ) , but not in T cells '' ( data not shown ) .
Consequently , the GM-CSF promoter may exist in a primed state in cultured endothelial cells and have a reduced dependence on the enhancer for its activation .
We also found some evidence suggesting that CsA can inhibit endothelial cell functions by suppressing factors other than NFAT .
E-selectin expression was inhibited by about 40 % in the presence of CsA by a process unlikely to directly involve NFAT .
The E-selectin promoter is activated principally by an array of NF-KB sites , '' `` which represented poor binding sites for NFATp .
Furthermore , the suppression of E-selectin by CsA was not limited to activation pathways involving Ca '' * .
CsA reduced E-selectin expression by the same extent regardless of whether TNF-a or PMA/A23187 was used to induce expression .
This was in marked contrast to the GM-CSF gene , which was suppressed by CsA when activated by PMA/A23187 , but not when activated by TNF-a .
CsA also suppressed induction of the DH site that forms over the array of NF- « B sites in the E-selectin promoter , suggesting that CsA may regulate members of the NF-kB family in endothelial cells .
This suggestion is supported by reports that CsA and FK506 can partially suppress two NF-kB family members in lymphoid celis .
** '' Indeed , the NF-kB p105/p50 gene promoter '' may itself be regulated by CsA , as it includes the sequence TGGACCGCATGA-CTCTA that closely resembles the NFAT consensus se-quence . ''
Alternatively , CsA may suppress E-selectin expression at the posttranscriptional level , thus accounting for the ability of CsA to suppress distinct pathways to the same extent .
However , E-selectin induction via PMA was not significantly influenced by CsA , arguing against a posttranscriptional mechanism .
The evidence accumulated in this study suggests that the ability of CsA to act as an antiinflammatory drug may be partly caused by direct effects on the endothelium .
Although immune and inflammatory disorders clearly involve complex cytokine networks operating within a confederacy of immune and nonimmune cell types , there is a significant role that the endothelium plays in their progression .
By suppressing GM-CSF and E-selectin expression in endothelial cells , CsA could reduce the extent to which neutrophils and eosinophils are recruited at sites of inflammation .
In this study , the effective dose of CsA ( 0.1 umol/L ) was well within the range of the plasma concentration of approximately 0.3 Lmol/L CsA that is usually maintained therapeuti-cally .
Hence , this study may , in part , account for the reduction in neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration observed on treatment of disorders such as and asthma '' with CsA .
