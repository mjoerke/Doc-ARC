44 ) : C740-C747 , 1998.-Endotoxin selectively induces monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) without affecting levels of Cu , Zn SOD , catalase , or glutathione peroxidase .
However , little is known about the structure-activity relationship and the mechanism by which endotoxin induces Mn SOD .
In this study we demonstrated that a mutant Escherichia coli endotoxin lacking myristoyl fatty acid at the 3 '' R-3-hydroxymy-ristate position of the lipid A moiety retained its full capacity to coagulate Limulus amoebocyte lysate compared with the wild-type E. coli endotoxin and markedly stimulated the activation of human monocyte nuclear factor-kB and the induction of Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity .
However , in contrast to the wild-type endotoxin , it failed to induce significant production of tumor necrosis factor- « and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 « by monocytes and did not induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase .
These results suggest that 1 ) lipid A myristoyl fatty acid , although it is important for the induction of inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes , is not necessary for the induction of Mn SOD , 2 ) endotoxin-mediated induction of Mn SOD and inflammatory cytokines are regulated , at least in part , through different signal transduction pathways , and 3 ) failure of the mutant endotoxin to induce tumor necrosis factor- « production is , at least in part , due to its inability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase .
lipopolysaccharide ; tumor necrosis factor ; nuclear factor- « kB ; mitogen-activated protein kinase ENDOTOXIN , a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria , is responsible for a host of toxic effects that occur in patients infected with these micro-organisms , including fever , disseminated intravascular coagulation , and hemodynamic changes that may lead to multiple organ failure characteristics of septic shock ( 19 , 24 ) .
On the other hand , LPS exhibits immunostimu-latory effects ( 19 , 24 ) and induces the antioxidant enzyme Mn superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) ( 1 , 27 ) , which are beneficial to the host .
Evidence suggests that induction of Mn SOD may be responsible for LPS-induced protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

C740 ( 31 , 33 ) .
However , the serious toxicities of LPS limit any potential clinical use for its beneficial effects .
The endotoxic effects of LPS are caused indirectly through the activation of monocytes and macrophages , leading to the release of toxic cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , and macrophage inflammatory proteins ( MIPs ) ( 4 , 5 , 19 , 24 ) .
The endotoxic principle of LPS resides in its lipid A component .
For full endotoxic activity in humans , a lipid A structure containing two B ( I-6 ) -linked p-glucosamine residues , two phosphoryl groups , and six fatty acids in a defined arrangement as present in Escherichia coli lipid A is required ( 19 , 24 , 25 ) .
The mechanism and the structural requirement for the induction of Mn SOD by LPS are not clear .
Recently , Somerville et al .
( 29 ) reported a 1,000- to 10,000-fold reduction in the ability of a mutant E. coli LPS lacking the myristoyl fatty acid moiety at the 3 '' R-3-hydroxymy-ristate position of lipid A ( nonmyristoyl LPS , nmLPS $ ) to stimulate E-selectin expression by human endothelial cells and TNF-a production by adherent monocytes compared with the wild-type LPS ( wtLPS ) .
In the current study we demonstrated that nmLPS at a concentration as high as 1 ug/ml failed to significantly induce TNF- « and MIP-1 « production by human monocytes , whereas it markedly induced the activation of nuclear factor- « kB ( NF- « kB ) and the induction of Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity .
In addition , nmLPS failed to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , a principal component of the signal transduction pathway known to be involved in the wtLPS-induced production of TNF-a ( 4 , 11 , 12 , 23 , 30 ) .
These results suggest that lipid A myristoyl fatty acid , although it is important for the induction of inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes , is not necessary for the induction of Mn SOD .
This mutant LPS can be used to distinguish the intracellular signal transduction pathways for LPS-induced cytokine production and Mn SOD induction and to study the potential beneficial effect of Mn SOD induction without the toxic effects of inflammatory cytokines .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .
The endotoxins wtLPS ( JM83 E. coli K-12 ) and nmLPS ( BMS67C12 E. coli K-12 ) were kindly provided by John E. Somerville ( Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute , Princeton , NJ ) .
The nmLPS preparation was free of wtLPS contamination as determined by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy .
Purified Mn SOD ( from E. coli ) and Cu , Zn SOD ( from bovine erythrocytes ) were obtained from Sigma Chemical ( St. Louis , MO ) .
Mn SOD and Cu , Zn SOD had a specific activity of 4,400 U/mg protein as Downloaded from www.physiclogy.org/journal/ajpcell ( 173.236.240.127 ) on May 10 , 2019 .
LPS , Mx SOD , AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR determined according to the method described by McCord and Fridovich ( 18 ) .
Polyclonal goat anti-recombinant human TNF antibody [ affinity-purified IgG , 1 mg/ml ; 50 % neutralization dose 0.02-0.04 ug/ml by cell lytic assay using murine L929 fibroblasts ] and normal goat IgG were purchased from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) .
Rabbit polyclonal antiphos-photyrosine and mouse monoclonal anti-rat MAPK antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexing-ton , KY ) .
Enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham Life Science ( Arling-ton Heights , IL ) .
Endotoxin assay .
The endotoxin activity of wtLPS and nmLPS was determined with the Limulus amoebocyte lysate ( LAL ) assay ( QCL-1000 , BioWhittakker , Walkersville , MD ) .
Isolation of human monocytes .
Human mononuclear cells were isolated from venous blood of normal volunteers ( after the nature and possible risks of the studies were explained and informed consent was obtained ) using Isolymph ( Gallard-Schlesinger Industries , Carle Place , NY ) .
Cells ( 5 X in RPMI 1640 plus antibiotics and 5 % autologous serum ) were allowed to adhere to tissue culture plates for 2 h. Adherent cells , which consisted of ~90 % monocytes as judged by a nonspecific esterase stain , were used for the current studies .
Measurements of TNF-a and MIP-1a « .
Adherent monocytes were treated with or without LPS ( 0.01 ng/ml-1.0 ug/ml ) for 1 , 4 , or 18 h at 37°C according to Somerville et al .
( 29 ) .
In some experiments , goat anti-recombinant human TNF - « IgG or normal goat IgG ( 0.16 mg/m ! )
was added to the incubation medium .
The amounts of TNF- « activity and MIP-1a « protein released into the medium or present in cell lysates ( collected by scraping and sonication ) were determined by the anti-TNF- « antibody-inhibitable lysis of murine L929 fibroblasts as described previously ( 34 ) and ELISA ( R & D Systems ) , respectively , carried out according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Measurements of SOD activity .
Adherent monocytes were treated with or without ( as control ) LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) for 1 , 4 , or 18 h at 37°C .
Cells were then collected by scraping and sonicated , and protein contents were determined using bicinchoninic acid according to Smith et al .
( 28 ) .
Aliquots of cell extracts ( 50 pg/lane ) were then assayed for SOD activity using nondenaturing PAGE ( 8 % ) according to the method described by Beauchamp and Fridovich ( 2 ) , on the basis of the inhibitory effect of SOD on the reduction of tetrazolium by superoxide generated by photochemically reduced riboflavin , as described previously ( 35 ) .
The SOD activity gels were quantified using a computing densitometer ( Molecular Dy-namics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
In each assay , purified E. coli Mn SOD and bovine erythrocyte Cu , Zn SOD ( 25-800 mU ) were used to obtain standard curves from which cell extract Mn SOD and Cu , Zn SOD activities , respectively , were derived .
Northern analysis of TNF-a and Mn SOD mRNAs .
Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously ( 88 ) .
Briefly , adherent monocytes were treated with or without 1 pg/ml LPS for 4 h at 37°C , and the total cellular RNA was isolated by the single-step method of Chomezynski and Sacchi ( 7 ) using Tri Reagent ( Molecular Research Center , Cincin-nati , OH ) .
For Northern blots , denatured RNA samples ( 20 ug/lane ) were electrophoresed in 1.2 % agarose gels , transferred to nylon membrane ( Genescreen plus , New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) by capillary blotting , and stained with methylene blue to visualize the quality and size of 188 and 28S ribosomal RNA species .
The membrane was then prehy-bridized as described previously ( 88 ) .
Hybridization was carried out with 100 ug/ml denatured salmon testis DNA and human TNF- « or Mn SOD cDNA probes that had been labeled by random hexanucleotide priming ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithers- CT74L burg , MD ) to a specific activity of > 10° cpm/ug DNA .
After the samples were washed , autoradiographs were obtained and radioactive signals were quantified using a computing densitometer .
Electrophoresis mobility shift assay for NF- « B .
Adherent monocytes were treated with or without 1 ug/ml LPS for 1 or 4h at 37°C , and the nuclear extracts were obtained according to Osnes et al .
( 21 ) .
For the electrophoresis mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , 3 ug of nuclear proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with ~100,000 cpm ( 5 ng ) of an oligonucleotide containing NF-kB consensus sequence ( 5'-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3 ' ) that had been 5'-end labeled with [ y-*°P ] JATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Competition was carried out using a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide 10 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe .
Samples were then electrophoresed in a 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel .
Autoradiographs were obtained and radioactive signals were quantified using a computing densitometer .
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting for MAPK .
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting for MAPK were performed as described previously ( 16 ) .
Briefly , adherent monocytes were treated with or without 1 ug/ml LPS for 1 h at 37°C .
After hypotonic lysis , cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Wen et al .
( 87 ) and immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with antiphos-photyrosine at 4°C with rocking .
Protein A-agarose was added and rocking continued for 1 h at 4°C .
Samples were eluted with 2 % sample solubilizer , and protein was separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE ( 9 % ) , transferred to Immobilon membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) by electroblotting , and blocked with 5 % milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween .
Membranes were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti- MAPK antibody ( 1:1,000 ) overnight at room tempera-ture , then with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody , rabbit anti-mouse IgG ( 1:1,000 , Dako , Carpenteria , CA ) for 1 h. Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system , exposed to X-ray film , and quantified using a computing densitometer .
Statistical analysis .
Data from two groups were compared by a two-tailed and those from more than two groups were compared by one-way ANOVA with correction for multiple comparison ( 10 ) .
A difference is considered to be significant at P < 0.05 .
RESULTS Effect of nmLPS on TNF-a and MIP-1a production .
To determine whether the reduced capacity of nmLPS to activate human monocytes was restricted to TNF-a production , we measured the production of TNF-a and MIP-1 « , a member of the chemokine B-family ( 89 ) , in response to wtLPS and nmLPS .
As shown in Fig .
14 , at 4 h after incubation , wtLPS induced a concentration ( 0.01 ng/ml-1.0 ug/ml ) -dependent release of TNF-a and MIP-1a into the medium .
In contrast , nmLPS even at a concentration as high as 1 ug/ml failed to induce a significant amount of cytokine release .
Time-course experiments using 1 ug/ml of LPS ( Fig .
1B ) demonstrated wtLPS-induced cytokine release within 1 h , reached a near plateau at 4 h , and lasted for 18 h. Production of TNF-a and MIP-l « by nmLPS-treated cells was markedly reduced throughout these time periods .
Measurement of TNF-a activity in cell lysates revealed negligible TNF- « in wtLPS- and nmLPS Downloaded from www.physiclogy.org/journal/ajpcell ( 173.236.240.127 ) on May 10 , 2019 .

Effects of wild-type ( wtLPS ) and nonmyristoyl lipopolysaccharide ( nmLP3 ) on tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 « ( MIP-1 « ) production by human monocytes .
Adherent monocytes in RPMI 1640 plus 5 % autologous serum were treated with or without LPS , and amounts of TNF- « activity and MIP-1 « released into media or present in cell lysates were determined .
A : dose ( 0.01 ng/ml-1.0 pg/ml ) -response experiment , 4 h incubation .

Lysate treated cells ( Fig .
1C ) , suggesting that reduced TNF-a release by nmLPS-treated monocytes was in fact due to a decreased production rather than an impaired secretion of the cytokine .
Effect of nmLPS on induction of Mn SOD .
We then determined whether nmLPS also had a similarly reduced capacity to induce Mn SOD .
LPS has been shown to selectively induce Mn SOD without affecting other antioxidant enzymes , including Cu , Zn SOD , catalase , and glutathione peroxidase ( 1 , 27 ) .
The results ( Fig .
2 ) revealed that at 18 h , but not at 1 or 4 h , after incubation , wtLPS induced a marked increase ( 2.5-fold ) in monocyte Mn SOD activity , whereas it had no effect on Cu , Zn SOD activity .
nmLP $ S also induced a significant increase ( 1.5-fold ) in the Mn SOD activity at 18 h , although to a lesser degree than wtLPS .
Figure 3 compares wtLPS and nmLPS in their endotoxin activities as measured by the ability to induce LPS , Mx SOD , AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR coagulation of the LAL and their capacities to induce monocyte cytokine ( TNF- « and MIP-1 « ) release and SOD ( Mn SOD and Cu , Zn SOD ) activities .
Compared with wtLPS , nmLPS has a comparable LAL clotting ability , consistent with the report of Somerville et al .
( 29 ) , a markedly reduced capacity to induce monocyte TNF-a and MIP-1l « release , and a relatively well preserved ability to induce monocyte Mn SOD .
Neither wtLPS nor nmLPS had an effect on Cu , Zn SOD .
The difference in Mn SOD activity between wtLPS-and nmLPS-treated cells , as shown in Fig .
3 , was statistically significant .
This difference could be due to the effect of TNF-a produced by wtLPS-treated cells , since TNF- « is known to induce Mn SOD ( 386 , 40 ) .
To test this possibility , we coincubated monocytes with wtLPS and anti-human TNF- « antibody ( anti-TNF- « IgG ) .
As shown in Fig .
44 , anti-TNF- « IgG completely neutralized the TNF-a activity induced by wtLPS , whereas control , nonspecific IgG had no effect .
In contrast , anti-TNF- « IgG did not reduce Mn SOD activity in wtLPS-treated cells to the level of nmLPS-treated cells ( Fig .
4 , B-D ) .
These results suggested that TNF-a did not contribute to the higher level of Mn SOD activity observed in wtLPS-treated monocytes .
Effect of nmLPS on TNF-a and Mn SOD mRNAs .
Northern analysis of TNF- « and Mn SOD mRNAs ( Fig .
5 ) further supported the above-observed effects of wtLPS and nmLP $ S in the production of TNF- « and the induction of Mn SOD enzyme activity by human monocytes .
wtLPS markedly enhanced the levels of TNF-a ( 17-fold ) and Mn SOD ( 7-fold ) mRNAs compared with control , nontreated cells .
nmLP $ S also induced a marked increase ( 6-fold ) in the level of Mn SOD mRNA , whereas it had a markedly reduced effect on TNF- « mRNA ( 1-fold increase vs. 17-fold increase by wtLPS8 ) .
Effect of nmLPS on activation of NF-kB .
Considerable evidence suggests that activation of NF-kB is essential for the induction of monocyte and macrophage TNF- « mRNA by LPS ( 4 , 24 , 26 ) .
Whether induction of monocyte Mn SOD mRNA by LPS is also dependent on NF- « B is not clear .
We took advantage of the differential effects of wtLPS and nmLPS observed above to determine the potential role of NF-KB activation in the LPS-induced induction of TNF- « and Mn SOD mRNAs using the EMSA .
As shown in Fig .
6 , wtLPS and nmLPS markedly activated NF- « B at 1 h after treatment .
However , by 4 h the effect was largely gone ( data not shown ) .
There was no difference between wtLPS and nmLPS .
Effect of nmLPS on activation of MAPK .
The MAPK signal transduction pathway plays an important role in the LPS-induced production of TNF-a ( 4 , 11 , 12 , 23 , 30 ) .
We determined whether failure of nmLPS to induce TNF- « production was due to its inability to activate MAPK .
Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine , then immuno-blot analysis of phosphorylated MAPK was performed .
As shown in Fig .
7 , wtLPS markedly increased the nuclear content of tyrosine-phosphorylated MAPK .

DISCUSSION The data presented in this study demonstrated that deletion of myristoyl fatty acid at the 3 '' R-3-hydroxymy-ristate position of the E. coli lipid A moeity ( nmLPS ) resulted in a markedly reduced ability to induce the production of not only TNF - « ( 29 ) , but also MIP-1 « , by human monocytes , suggesting a more generalized phenomenon of impaired induction of inflammatory cytokine production by nmLPS .
Furthermore , the impaired induction of inflammatory cytokine production by nmLPS was associated with an impaired activation 44 A 22 , B 110 , C -_ 40 20 100 2 36 _ 18 = 90 3 32 x € 16 x £ so w 28 * ye 2 70 z , .

The production of TNF-a by monocytes is regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels ( 4 , 14 , 15 ) .
The exact signal transduction pathway ( s ) by which LPS induces TNF- « production has not been fully established .
However , LPS stimulates TNF- « gene transcription and translation , and it requires the activation of the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) /ras/raf-1/ MEK/MAPK signal transduction pathway and NF- « kB ( 4 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 23 , 30 ) .
Thus the inability to activate MAPK by nmLPS may explain the observed impairment in TNF- « production by nmLPS-treated human monocytes .
The exact location and mechanism by which nmLP $ S fails to activate MAPK are not clear .
It is likely to be at the level of PTK activation ( receptor-PTK interaction ) or ras activation , since other members of ? H * € !

C744 the MAPK pathway do not have access to the plasma membrane at which wtLPS or nmLP $ S is acting .
Further studies are necessary to clarify this point .
Activation of although essential , is not sufficient for the induction of TNF- « mRNA and production of TNF-a by LPS in monocytes/macrophages .
Peritoneal macrophages from LPS-resistant , C3H/HeJ mice are able to respond to LPS by activating NF- « B normally ( 9 ) but are unable to induce TNF- « mRNA and produce TNF-a ( 3 ) .
The TNF- « synthetic pathway in C3H/HeJ macrophages is intact , since they are able to produce TNF-a normally on costimulation with inter-feron-y and LPS ( 6 ) .

activated monocyte NF- < kB normally but failed to induce TNF-a mRNA and TNF-a production is consistent with this concept .
Recent studies suggest that concerted participation of cis-acting regulatory elements at the Egr-1 ( 42 ) , AP-1/CRE-like ( 20 ) , NF-IL6 ( C/EBPB ) ( 22 ) , and xkB3 sites is required for optimal induction of the TNF- « promoter by LPS in human monocytes .
Binding of LPS to a circulating LPS-binding protein , which in turn binds to the monocyte LPS membrane receptor mCD14 , is essential in the efficient cellular response to low concentrations ( < 100 ng/ml ) of LPS ( 4 , 30 , 32 , 41 ) .
However , the concentration of LPS used in the current study ( 1 ug/ml ) is not dependent on mCD14 binding to induce TNF-a production by human monocytes ( 4 , 30 ) .
Somerville et al .
( 29 ) demonstrated that the effect of nmLPS can be inhibited by a monoclonal anti-CD14 antibody , MY4 .

trations , nmLPS competitively inhibits wtLPS-induced E-selectin induction in human endothelial cells .
It was , therefore , suggested that nmLPS could serve as an LPS antagonist through competitive binding to mCD14 ( 29 ) .
A recent study by Cunningham et al .
( 8 ) reveals that nmLPS , compared with wtLPS , binds normally to immobilized soluble CD14 ( sCD14 ) and a panel of 23 different point-mutated sCD14 molecules .
Thus failure of nmLPS to induce TNF-a production by human monocytes is unlikely due to an impaired binding to CD14 .
Little is known about the regulation of Mn SOD gene expression and the signal transduction pathway ( s ) responsible for the LPS-mediated induction of Mn SOD .
Our results suggest that inductions of Mn SOD and TNF- « by LPS are mediated through different signal transduction pathways , since nmLPS was able to induce Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity without inducing TNF- « mRNA and activity .
These results are consistent with previous observations in LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ mice .
Peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice are unable to produce TNF-a in response to LPS ( 3 ) ; however , LPS is able to induce Mn SOD normally in these macrophages compared with macrophages from C745 LPS-sensitive , C3H/HeOuJ mice ( 13 ) .
Although LPS induction of Mn SOD in human monocytes , as demonstrated in the current study and in peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice ( 9 , 13 ) , is associated with the activation of the role of NF-KB activation in the induction of Mn SOD by LPS can not be conclusively ascertained .
The reason for the reduced increase of Mn SOD activity in nmLPS-treated moncytes in the face of an almost comparable increase in Mn SOD mRNA , compared with wtLPS-treated cells , is not clear .
However , we demonstrated that neutralization of TNF-a activity did not reduce Mn SOD activity of wtLPS-treated cells to the level of nmLPS-treated monocytes , suggesting that TNF- « produced by wtLPS-treated cells could not account for the observed difference in the levels of Mn SOD activity .
Because nmLPS is unable to activate MAPK , it is possible that the MAPK pathway via cross talk contributes to the signal transduction cascade involved in the induction of Mn SOD by LPS and that the inability of nmLPS to activate MAPK is responsible for the reduced increase of Mn SOD activity in nmLPS-treated monocytes .
Further studies are necessary to determine the role of MAPK in the induction of Mn SOD by LPS .
In addition , IL-1 , which is known to be produced by wtLPS-treated monocytes , can also induce A 68 kDa - ® sio .

C746 Mn SOD ( 17 ) .
It is not clear whether nmLPS induces monocytes to produce IL-1 and whether IL-1 produced by wtLPS-treated monocytes can account for the observed difference in the levels of MnSOD activity between wtLPS- and nmLPS-treated cells .
In summary , we have demonstrated that induction of Mn SOD and TNF- « production by LPS in human monocytes can be dissociated , suggesting that induction of Mn SOD and TNF-a is regulated by different signal transduction pathways .
The ability of nmLPS to induce Mn SOD without inflammatory cytokine production provides an opportunity to study the potential benefits of an LPS-induced increase in Mn SOD without the associated toxic effects of inflammatory cytokines .
