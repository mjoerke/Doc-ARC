NEOPLASIA Analysis of BCL-6 mutations in classic Hodgkin disease of the B- and T-cell type Volkhard Seitz , Michael Hummel , loannis Anagnostopoulos , and Harald Stein BCL-6 is essential for germinal center formation and thus for affinity maturation of immunoglobulin ( ig ) genes by somatic mutations .
The 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene is even a target for the mutation machinery .
Translocations of the BCL-6 gene to heterologous promoters and mutations of its 5-noncoding regulatory region were reported to be potential mechanisms for deregulating BCL-6 expression and for playing a role in the genesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma .
In line with this hypothesis is the observation that B-cell Iymphoma with somatic mutations , such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular Iymphoma , also carry BCL-6 mutations , some of which are recurrently detectable .
Classic Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) is also derived from B cells with high loads of somatic mutations and thus a further candidate for BCL-6 mutations .
To determine the presence and potential role of BCL-6 mutations in cHD , the 5'-noncoding BCL-6 proportion of single Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( HRS ) cells from 6 cases of cHD and 6 cases of HD-derived cell lines was analyzed .
All B-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines harbored BCL-6 mutations .
In contrast , both T-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines were devoid of BCL-6 mutations .
With only one exception , there were no lymphoma-specific recurrent BCL-6 mutations detected , and BCL-6 protein was absent from the HRS cells of most cases .
In conclusion , ( 1 ) somatic BCL-6 mutations are restricted to cHD cases of B-cell origin , and ( 2 ) the BCL-6 mutations represent mostly irrelevant somatic base substitutions without consequences for BCL-6 protein expression and the pathogenesis of cHD .
( Blood .
2001 ; 97:2401-2405 ) ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction The proto-oncogene BCL-6 is , with the exception of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) heavy and light chain genes , the only gene that is known to be significantly somatically mutated in the course of the germinal center ( GC ) reaction in B cells .
* These somatic mutations occur preferentially in the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene . ''
In addition , somatic hypermutations , as well as translocations , in the BCL-6 regulatory element are frequently found in B-cell lymphoma originating from GC or post-GC B cells . ''
It is postulated that these alterations affecting the transcriptional activity of the BCL-6 gene are involved in the pathogenesis of several lymphoma entities . ''
This holds especially true for follicular lymphoma ( FL ) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , which harbor , in addition to their highly mutated Ig genes , alterations in the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene . '' ''
The tumor cells of classical Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) , the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( HRS ) cells , are also derived from highly mutated GC or post-GC B cells in the vast majority of cases . '' ''
Only a small proportion of cases originate from T cells , as shown by their rearranged TCR genes . ''
It is therefore tempting to speculate that the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene is mutated in HRS cells and , comparable to the situation described for FL and DLBCL , involved in the pathogenesis of cHD .
However , BCL-6 is expressed in only a proportion of cHD cases , '' '' thereby raising the question of the significance of BCL-6 in HD .
Furthermore , it is interesting to see whether there are differences in the mutational pattern of BCL-6 in HRS cells of B- or T-cell genotype supporting the view of 2 different disease entities .
To clarify the mutational status of BCL-6 in cHD , we isolated single HRS cells from 6 patients and analyzed the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene .
Furthermore , nonneoplastic cells were isolated for comparison .
Our data show that all patients with cHD with a B-cell genotype harbor mutated BCL-6 genes , whereas patients with cHD with T-cell genotype lack mutations .
This lends further credit to the hypothesis that cHD of T- and B-cell genotype are biological distinct entities .
Material and methods Tissue samples , cell lines , and immunostaining From a series of cHD cases from the files of the Institute of Pathology , Berlin , Germany , we selected 6 cases .
Two of these patients displayed a T-cell genotype , and 4 patients displayed a B-cell genotype .
In addition , 6 HD-derived cell lines ( L428 , KMH2 , L591 , L1236 , L540 , and Holden ) were included in this study .
DNA extraction High molecular weight DNA was extracted from 5.0 X 105 cell line cells employing the QIAamp Tissue Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
DNA was dissolved in 100 uL distilled water , quantified photometrically , and used as a template for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .

Immunohistochemistry Both lymph node biopsies and HD-derived cell lines were immunohisto-chemically analyzed by a panel of monoclonal antibodies against CD30 ( Ber-H2 ) , CD15 ( C3D1 ) , LMP-1 ( CS1-4 ) , CD20 ( L26 ) , BCL-6 ( 594 ) , CD3 ( UCHT1 ) , CD8 ( C8/144B ) ( all from Dako Diagnostics , Hamburg , Ger-many ) , and perforin ( P1-8 ) ( Kamiya Biomedical Company , Seattle , WA ) .
Immunostaining was performed on frozen or formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded sections employing the of alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase ( APAAP ) technique .
'* Paraffin-embedded sections were pre-treated by pressure cooking as previously described . '' ''
Single cell isolation Using a hydraulic micromanipulation device , CD30+® HRS cells were isolated from immunostained frozen tissue sections from 6 patients with cHD . '
We pooled 2-7 single HRS cells to obtain higher PCR amplification rates .
All cases were analyzed at least twice in completely independent cell isolation procedures and PCR assays .
In cases with mutated BCL-6 5'-noncoding sequences in the HRS cells ( reference sequence AF191831 ) , '' additional CD30~ reactive cells were investigated to rule out individual polymorphism .
Furthermore , buffers overlaying the tissue sections during the cell isolation process were used as negative controls .
PCR Isolated cells were digested with 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) for 1 hour at 50°C and , after heat denaturation of the enzyme , subjected to a seminested BCL-6 PCR .
The PCR was carried with Tag buffer ( PerkinElmer ) supplemented with 1.5 mM magnesium dichloride ( MgCl ) , 0.8 mM dNTP ( deoxynucleoside-5'-triphosphate ) , 50 ng of each primer , and 2 U Taq DNA polymerase ( PerkinElmer ) .
The first round of amplification was performed employing beléup ( 5'-ATG CTT TGG CTC CAA GTT-3 ' ) and belélow ( 5'-CAC GAT ACT TCA TCT CAT C-3 ' ) .
For re-amplification the belélow primer was replaced by a nested belélow2 primer ( 5-CGG CTC GAA GGC AGG-3 ' ) .
The PCR conditions were 96°C for 15 seconds , 62°C for 1 minute , and 72°C for 50 seconds for the initial 5 cycles .
For the remaining 35 cycles the annealing conditions were reduced to 60°C for 30 seconds .
The re-amplification was carried out under the same PCR conditions with the exception of 10 initial cycles of higher stringency instead of 5 cycles .
Negative and positive controls for single cell analysis were performed under the same conditions , whereas 400 ng cell line DNA was amplified by only one round of PCR .
Reaction mixtures were analyzed on 1.5 % agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide .
Bands of appropriate size were excised from the gels and purified with the Qiaex-2 DNA isolation kit ( Qiagen ) .
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products Purified PCR products obtained from B-cell-derived HD cell lines were cloned ( Topo cloning , Invitrogen , Westbrook , ME ) , and 10-20 randomly selected colonies were sequenced by fluorescence chain termination technique ( Bigdye ; ABI , Weiterstadt , Germany ) on an automated sequencer ( ABI 377A , ABI ) .
The resulting sequences were compared to published data bank sequences ( GenBank ) and our own unpublished sequences .
Results Genotype and immunophenotype of the HRS cells The genotype and expression profile of the 6 cHD cases used for the present study have been described elsewhere . ''
In brief , the HRS cells of 4 cases harbored highly mutated rearranged IgH genes , whereas the other 2 cases displayed HRS cells with clonal TCR Both cases with rearranged TCR genes displayed a strong expression of perforin in all tumor cells .
One of the cases with a B-cell genotype ( patient no .
5 ) was positive for the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -encoded LMP-1 protein ( Table 1 ) .
The expression of BCL-6 was heterogeneous among the cases and cell lines investigated .
Two cHD cases ( one case with TCR rearrangement and one with Ig H rearrangement ) disclosed a BCL-6 expression of virtually all HRS cells , whereas BCL-6 was completely absent in the HRS cells of 2 further cases ( both with IgH rearrangement ) .
In the remaining 2 cases , scattered HRS cells were BCL-6+* .
Imunostaining of HD-derived cell lines for BCL-6 revealed single BCL-6* cells in cell lines L1236 , L428 , KMH2 , and Holden .
Up to 10 % of the cells were positive only in cell lines L540 and L591 ( Table 2 ) .

Furthermore , 6 HD-derived cell lines were included in this study .
From each cell line , 5-18 sequences were analyzed by cloning of the PCR products .
Only base substitutions that were repeatedly found in completely independent analyses were considered as real mutations .
Unique alterations were regarded as errors of the Taq polymerase .
The BCL-6 sequences of all 4 B-cell-derived HD cases and the 4 B-cell-derived HD cell lines carried 1-15 somatic alterations ( Tables 3 and 4 ) .
Approximately half of these mutations represented transitions , whereas the remaining half represented transversions .

In addition , mutation 445A > T was found in cell line L428 .
Furthermore , we were able to discriminate both alleles in this cell line .
{ Mutation is located at an RGWY motif . ''
$ The presence of 3 alleles in cell line L1236 is in harmony with its karyotype . '' ''
§Site of mutation also described in reactive B cells . ''
the BCL-6 mutations observed in HRS cells are somatic and were most likely introduced in the course of the GC reaction .
Most of these mutations are new and are not yet described elsewhere .
The remaining 4 mutations were recurrent . ''
However , 2 of these mutations were located in a RGWY mutation hotspot , '' and another one occurred at a site that was also reported to be mutated in reactive B cells . ''
Therefore , 3 of 4 recurrent mutations do not represent lymphoma-specific base substitutions .
In contrast to the B-cell-derived cHD cases and cell lines , both cHD cases with T-cell genotype , as well as the 2 T-cell-derived HD cell lines , were unmutated ( Tables 3 and 4 ) .
To determine whether the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene of GC T cells could be affected by the somatic hypermutation machinery , we isolated 29 GC T cells identified by their B-F1 positivity .
The sequence analysis of the 5 resulting BCL-6 PCR products disclosed that none of these cells displayed somatic mutations introduced in the GC environment .
Correlation of the somatic igH and BCL-6 mutations and BCL-6 protein expression We compared the frequency of somatic mutations found in the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene with those published for the IgH genes in corresponding cases ( Table 2 ) .
' > '' '' Although all cases with IgH mutations displayed BCL-6 mutations , there was no correlation in the number of mutations .
Furthermore , there was no correlation between the number of BCL-6 mutations and the BCL-6 expression .
Discussion Previous studies have shown a correlation between the appearance of somatic hypermutations in the Ig genes and the presence of mutations in the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene . '' '' ''
Consequently , this correlation can also be observed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , such as FL and DLBCL , which carry high loads of mutations in their Ig genes . '' ''
The precise role of BCL-6 in the pathogenesis of the NHL is , however , not yet clear .
CHD represents a lymphoma entity that is derived from B cells with highly mutated Ig genes in most instances ( approximately From www .

2404 _ SETZ etal 98 % ) and from T cells in a few cases ( approximately 2 % ) .
To determine whether B-cell-derived cHD cases , as well as T-cell-derived cHD cases , carry mutations in their 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene , we isolated 202 single HRS cells from 6 patients with cHD .
Four of these patients harbored HRS cells of B-cell genotype , whereas 2 further patients harbored HRS cells of T-cell genotype . ''
For comparison , 6 HD cell lines ( 4 with B-cell genotype and 2 with T-cell genotype ) were included in this study , and 201 single reactive cells were analyzed .
The results obtained were equivocal in that all patients with B-cell-derived HD and HD cell lines of B-cell type were found to carry somatic BCL-6 mutations .
In contrast , patients with T-cell-derived HD and cell lines were devoid of base substitutions in the BCL-6 gene as well as T cells isolated from the GC .
This indicates that reactive GC T cells are not affected by the mutational machinery , whereas this has already been demonstrated for reactive GC B cells in previous investigations . ''
The finding of BCL-6 mutations in patients with B-cell-derived HD raises the question of the role these alterations play in the pathogenesis of HD .
For this purpose we analyzed the position of the BCL-6 mutations and compared these findings with previously published data described for B-cell NHLS as well as with the BCL-6 sequences obtained from nonmalignant cells of our own cHD cases .
In 3 of 4 B-cell-type HD cases , the detected BCL-6 mutations represent single base substitutions not previously described or which are located in known mutational hotspots ( RGWY motif ) . ''
These alterations can be considered as irrelevant somatic mutations not affecting the expression of the BCL-6 gene .
In the remaining case , however , a deletion of thymidine ( T ) at position 520 ( 520delT ) , which is described as the most common recurrent mutation in B-cell NHL , was found . ''
This deletion might cause an up-regulation of BCL-6 gene expression , ie , by the generation of a new transcription factor binding site ( eg , MZF1 ) .
This assumption is in harmony with the results of the protein expression analysis in this case because a strong expression of BCL-6 was found in virtually all tumor cells .
In contrast , in all other B-cell-derived cHD cases , the HRS cells were negative for BCL-6 with the exception of a few scattered tumor cells .
The absence of relevant BCL-6 mutations , as well as the absence of BCL-6 protein expression , in all but one case of the References BLOOD , 15 APRIL 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 8 B-cell genotype challenge the role of BCL-6 in the pathogenesis of cHD .
Based on previous data it can be assumed that HRS cells represent late GC B cells that were not selected for antigen affinity and carry nonfunctional Ig rearrangements in approximately 30 % of cases . '' ''
Furthermore it was shown that the absence of Ig expression is not due to crippled Ig mutations , but rather to a defective transcription machinery . ''
The absence of BCL-6 expression fits well in this scenario because late GC B cells and post-GC B cells are largely BCL-6- .
! ° Thus , the missing BCL-6 expression in most HRS cells can be interpreted as reminiscence of the differentiation stage of the tumor precursor cells .
The complete absence of BCL-6 mutations in T-cell-derived cHD cases clearly indicates that alterations in this gene are not involved in the pathogenesis of this type of HD .
The finding that one of the 2 T-cell-derived HD cases showed , despite the absence of BCL-6 mutations , an expression of BCL-6 could reflect a derivation from BCL-6* ( GC ) T cells .
Because reactive GC T cells do not carry BCL-6 mutations , they are not affected by the mutational machinery responsible for Ig mutations .
This is in contrast to the findings in cHD of B-cell type , where the transforma-tional event seems to be closely related to the activity of the GC mutator . ''
We conclude from these findings that the molecular events that are responsible for the pathogenesis of B-cell-derived cHD are different from those giving rise to T-cell-derived cHD .
In conclusion , our data show that B-cell-derived cHD cases carry somatic mutations in the 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene , whereas T-cell-derived cHD cases , as well as GC T cells , were unmutated .
This supports a 2-entity concept for B- and T-cell-derived cHD .
Because only one case carried a lymphoma-specific recurrent mutation and BCL-6 was absent from the HRS cells in most cases , BCL-6 does not appear to be relevant for the pathogenesis of both B-cell- and T-cell-type cHD .
