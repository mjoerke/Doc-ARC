Inhibition of T Cell Signaling by Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase-targeted Hematopoietic Tyrosine Phosphatase ( HePTP ) * ( Received for publication , November 23 , 1998 , and in revised form , February 3 , 1999 ) Manju Saxenat , Scott Williamst , Johannes Brockdorff§ , Jennifer Gilman , and Tomas Mustelin $ ] From the Division of Cell Biology , La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology , San Diego , California 92121 Activation of T lymphocytes to produce cytokines is regulated by the counterbalance of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases , many of which have a high degree of substrate specificity because of physical association with their targets .
Overexpression of hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase ( HePTP ) results in suppression of T lymphocyte activation as measured by T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factors binding to the 5 promoter of the interleukin-2 gene .
Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of HePTP in the signaling cascade revealed that HePTP acts directly on the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases Erkl and 2 and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in intact T cells .
In contrast , HePTP had no effects on N-terminal c-Jun kinase or on events upstream of the MAP kinases .
The specificity of HePTP correlated with its physical association through its noncatalytic N terminus with Erk and another MAP kinase , p38 , but not Jnk or other proteins .
We propose that HePTP plays a negative role in antigen receptor signaling by specifically regulating MAP kinases in the cytosol and at early time points of T cell activation before the activation-induced expression of nuclear dual-specific MAP kinase phosphatases .
Phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosyl residues is an important mechanism for many signal transduction pathways controlling cell growth , differentiation , and development ( 1-3 ) .
Although the phosphotyrosine ( Tyr ( P ) ) content of cellular proteins is the net result of the opposing effects of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPases ) , most investigators have concentrated on the protein-tyrosine kinases , and considerably less is currently known about the PTPases .
The hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase ( HePTP ) was cloned from human T lymphocytes ( 4 , 5 ) , and it is * This work was supported by a fellowship from the Alfred Benzon Foundation ( to J .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org expressed in thymus , spleen , and in most leukemic cell lines examined , including Jurkat T leukemia cells ( 6 ) .
HePTP belongs to a subgroup of PT'Pases with two other members , STEP ( 7 ) and PCPTPL ( 8 , 9 ) .
In contrast to HePTP , the other two enzymes are not expressed in hematopoietic cells but mainly in the central nervous system : STEP mainly in striatum ( 7 ) , and PCPTP1 particularly in cerebellum ( 8 ) .
Like PCPTPI1 and the 46-kDa isoform of STEP , HePTP consists of a single PTPase domain that occupies the C-terminal 3/4 of the enzyme and is preceded by an ~80-amino acid noncatalytic N terminus .
As might be expected from the lack of putative transmembrane sequences or other recognizable targeting motifs , immunofluo-rescence microscopy indicates that HePTP is located exclusively in the cytosol in RBL mast cells ( 10 ) and Jurkat T cells . ?
The biological function of HePTP has remained elusive .
A potential role in cell proliferation or differentiation was suggested by the finding that the HePTP gene is located at 1432.1 ( 11 ) on the long arm of chromosome 1 , which is often found in extra copies ( trisomy ) in bone marrow cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( 12 , 13 ) , a disease characterized by reduced hematopoiesis .
In contrast , deletions of 1q32 have been reported in non-Hodkin lymphomas and chronic lymphoprolif-erative disorders ( 14 ) .
Thus , these findings suggest that excess HePTP may correlate with reduced proliferation ( in myelodys-plasia ) and loss of HePTP with increased cell proliferation and/or survival .
Amplification and overexpression of HePTP has also been reported in a case of myelogenous leukemia ( 11 ) .
A connection with lymphoid proliferation is also supported by the finding that the HePTP gene is transcriptionally activated in T cells treated with interleukin-2 ( 15 ) .
Although mRNA levels increased severalfold upon stimulation of normal mouse lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin , lipopolysaccharide , concanavalin A , or anti-CD3 ( 4 ) , the HePTP protein was present in resting cells , and its amount increased only moderately .
Finally , HePTP has been reported to become phosphorylated on tyrosine in RBL-2H3 mast cells stimulated through their FeeRI ( 10 ) .
We recently reported that transient expression of HePTP in T cells caused a clear reduction in antigen receptor-induced transcriptional activation of a reporter gene driven by a nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) /activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) element taken from the interleukin-2 gene promoter ( 6 ) .
In contrast , a catalytically inactive C27058 mutant of HePTP had no effect , suggesting that the PTPase activity of HePTP was required for inhibition .
We have continued this work and have found that HePTP inhibits NFAT/AP-1 activation , and thereby the entire 5 ' interleukin-2 promoter , by dephosphorylating the Erk MAP kinase .
Specificity for this substrate is the result of a physical association between HePTP and Erk mediated by the noncatalytic N terminus of HePTP .
This region also bound the p38 MAP kinase but not the N-terminal c-Jun ki- 2 M. Saxena , S. Williams , and T. Mustelin , unpublished observation .

RESULTS HePTP Reduces AP-1-dependent Gene Activation-A crucial step in the initiation of an immune response is the production of cytokines by T cells challenged with properly presented antigen ( 22 ) .
T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of the interleukin-2 gene is the result of the coordinated action of several transcription factors ( 23 , 24 ) , including a trimeric complex consisting of a NFAT family protein ( 25 ) and an AP-1 GST GST-HePTP O GST HePTP est| A GST-HePTP-c2708 @ est GST-HePTP-c2705 @ 0 A .
5 ha w & g w 8 D d g g. E & + a 8 GST-SHP2 dimer ( 26 , 27 ) of Fos and Jun family proteins , with some assistance from octamer-binding proteins ( Oct ) and NF-kB .
Although these proteins operate in a synergistic manner , they can be measured separately using their target DNA elements coupled to a reporter gene .
When HePTP was expressed in Jurkat T cells together with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 5 ' interleukin-2 promoter , the activation of this reporter was reduced to 58.1 + 9.3 % ( n = 9 ) .
In contrast , expression of the catalytically inactive mutant HePTP-C2705 or two other PTPases , SHP2 and TCPTP , did not affect the activation of the reporter gene although being expressed at similar levels .
The inhibition by HePTP was not as pronounced as its effect on a reporter gene driven by a subregion of the interleukin-2 promoter , one of the NFAT/AP-1 response elements , which was inhibited by more than 80 % ( 6 ) .
This discrepancy is probably explained by the minimal effects of HePTP on luciferase reporter constructs driven by Oct or NF-kB ( not shown ) .
Together , these results further support the notion that HePTP may play a role in antigen-induced T cell activation and suggests that HePTP dephosphorylates some signaling molecule in the pathways that lead from the antigen receptor to the activation of the NFAT/AP-1 response elements in the interleukin-2 gene .
Therefore , we decided to examine several receptor-proximal signaling steps upstream of this transcription factor complex .
HePTP Inhibits Erk but Not Ink-First , we measured the two types of MAP kinases known to be involved in AP-1 activation in T cells , Erk and Junk ( 27 , 28 ) .
Jurkat T cells were transiently co-transfected with epitope-tagged Erk2 together with HePTP , HePTP-C2708 , TCPTP , or SHP2 .
After stimulation of the cells , the catalytic activity of the kinases was meas-ured .
These experiments consistently revealed that the antigen receptor-induced activation of Erk was significantly reduced by HePTP .
In cells stimulated for different periods of time with anti-CD3e ( Fig .
10 ) , the inhibition by HePTP was seen at all time points but most clearly at 2-5 min , coinciding with the peak of Erk activity .
Similar results were also obtained in Zap-70-deficient P116 cells ( 18 ) co-transfected with Zap-70 , except that the effects of both wild-type HePTP and HePTP-C2708 were even stronger ( Fig .
16 ) , presumably because of the lower levels of endogenous HePTP in these cells . ''

blocked interleukin-2 promoter activation more efficiently in these cells ( not shown ) .
Thus , the effect of transfected HePTP correlates inversely with the amount of endogenous HePTP , suggesting that the observed inhibition of MAP kinase represents the normal function of HePTP .
In agreement with the notion that HePTP inhibits the activation of the interleukin-2 gene by reducing the magnitude and duration of Eirk activation , we observed that expression of Erk2 plus an activated mutant ( 29 ) of Mek , the upstream activator of Erk , augmented interleukin-2 promoter activation and increased its sensitivity to HePTP ( Fig .
le ) .
As a control , co-expression of activated Mkk6 plus p38 kinases did not affect the interleukin-2 reporter or its inhibition by HePTP ( not shown ) .
Furthermore , the activation of another gene known to be up-regulated , in part , through Erk-mediated phosphorylation of the Elk-1 transcription factor ( 30 ) , c-fos , was also reduced in T cells overexpressing HePTP but not in cells expressing the inactive HePTP-C2708 ( not shown ) .
Together , all these results indicate that HePTP reduces the activation of Erk in vivo .
This notion is supported by the opposite effect of catalytically inactive HePTP-C2708 in the same assays .
HePTP Inhibits Endogenous Erk but Not Upstream Events-To ascertain that the observed inhibition by HePTP was not limited to exogenous transfected MAP kinase , we next utilized the JCaM1 cell line , which is unresponsive to T cell antigen receptor stimulation because of lack of Leck kinase ( 17 ) .
Transient expression of Leck ( or Syk ) restores responsiveness ( 20 ) .
JCaM1l cells were transfected with Lck together with HePTP , HePTP-C2708 , or control PTPases and used for analysis of antigen receptor-induced appearance of activated and phosphorylated MAP kinases by immunoblotting with activa- tion-specific antibodies .
Fig .
1d shows that HePTP reduced the appearance of phospho-Erk1 and -2 , while at the same time and in the same cells , not having any effects on activation of Mek or the receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins ( Fig .
le ) , including the { chain of the T cell antigen receptor and Zap-70 ( verified by immunoprecipitation ) .
Additional immunoblots of the same samples showed that the expression of endogenous Erk and Mek , as well as transfected Lck and PTPases , was equal in all samples .
On longer expo-sures , it was also noted that the catalytically inactive HePTP-C2708 elevated the amount of phospho-Erk in the resting cells .
Thus , HePTP readily inhibits endogenous MAP kinase , and the catalytically inactive HePTP-C2708 acts as a dominant negative reducing the action of endogenous HePTP .
HePTP Also Inhibits Phorbol Ester-induced Erk Activation-The MAP kinase pathway can also be efficiently activated by phorbol esters , which bypass all receptor-induced proximal tyrosine phosphorylation events by activating the Raf kinase through protein kinase C ( 31 , 32 ) .
When tagged Erk2 was expressed in JCaM1 cells together with HePTP and the cells were stimulated with 20 nm phorbol myristate acetate , the activation of the MAP kinase was profoundly inhibited compared with cells expressing Erk2 alone ( Fig .
1f ) .
In contrast to cells stimulated by anti-CD3 ( Zanes 2 , 4 , and 6 ) , phorbol ester-induced MAP kinase activation did not require expression of Lick .
Control blots confirmed that the immunoprecipitates contained equal amounts of Erk2 and that equal amounts of HePTP and Lck were expressed in the transfectants ( Fig .
If , lower panels ) .
Because HePTP is specific for Tyr ( P ) , this result supports the conclusion that HePTP does not block MAP kinase activation by dephosphorylating receptor-proximal tyrosine 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog HePTP Binds and Dephosphorylates MAP Kinase phosphorylation events .
Rather , these data suggest a more direct effect on Erk .
Direct Effect of HePTP on Erk-Having found that HePTP had no effects on the phosphorylation of Mek in the same cells where Erk phosphorylation was reduced , we asked if HePTP acts directly on phospho-Eirk .
First , we phosphorylated recombinant kinase-inactive Erkl at the activation loop threonine and tyrosine residues using active recombinant Mek and treated the resulting phospho-Erk with recombinant HePTP at 37 °C .
As shown in Fig .
2a , the Tyr ( P ) content of Erk decreased detectably within 10-30 s and was very low by 1-5 min .
Phosphoamino acid analysis of similarly treated Erk ] phosphorylated by Mek in the presence of [ 7-32P ] ATP revealed that HePTP caused a rapid loss of phosphate from tyrosine without hydrolyzing phosphothreonine ( Fig .
26 ) .
Furthermore , a brief incubation at 37°C of active recombinant Erk with HePTP resulted in a total loss of its kinase activity ( Fig .
2¢c ) .
In contrast , GST , HePTP-C2708 , or SHP2 had no effects .
Using 10 ng ( 150 fmol ) of recombinant Erk , we found that 10 ng ( 150 fmol , 7.5 nx ) or more of HePTP caused a complete inactivation of Erk within the first minute of the assay , whereas the addition of 1 ng ( 15 fmol ) of HePTP had insignificant ( < 10 % ) effects even during a 30-min assay ( Fig .
2d ) .
This result suggests that HePTP acts on Erk at a 1:1 stoichiometry , perhaps by binding and primarily dephosphorylating only the bound kinase molecules .
Physical Association between HePTP and MAP Kinase-To directly test the possibility that HePTP binds Erk , we used GST fusion proteins of HePTP , HePTP-C2708 , or SHP2 and found that both HePTP and HePTP-C2708 readily bound Erk ( Fig .
30 ) in lysates of resting T cells or cells treated with pervanadate ( to maximize tyrosine phosphorylation ( 83 ) ) .
The precipitates also reacted strongly with antibodies to another MAP kinase , p38 .
In contrast , neither Jnk1l nor Jnk2 bound , and control GST , GST-SHP2 ( Fig .
30 ) , or GST-TCPTP ( not shown ) did not precipitate any of these kinases .
Immunoblotting with antibodies to the 36-38-kDa LAT ( 34 ) or to other signaling molecules gave negative results .
The Erk and p38 that bound active HePTP did not contain Tyr ( P ) and were catalytically inactive .
In contrast , Erk and p38 bound to inactive HePTP-C27085 from pervanadate-treated cells were phosphorylated on tyrosine and enzymatically highly active against myelin basic protein or GST-ATF2 , a preferred substrate for p38 kinase ( Fig .
3b ) .
In these reactions , GST-HePTP was also phosphorylated by the bound Erk and p38 .
HePTP also co-immunoprecipitated with p38 from untreated or activated Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
3¢ ) .
Co-immunoprecipitation of HePTP and Erk was not as clean because of nonspecific binding of Erk to Sepharose beads coated with irrelevant immunoglobulin ( Fig .
3d ) .
We conclude that HePTP specifically associates with Erk and p38 MAP kinases .
HePTP Also Inhibits Activation of p38 Kinase but Not Activation of Ink-The finding that HePTP associates with both Erk and p38 , but not with Jnk , prompted us to study the direct effects of HePTP on the kinase activity of p38 in vitro and on the activation of p38 and Jnk in intact cells .
First , we used 10 ng of recombinant active p38 kinase , added 100 ng of GST-HePTP , GST-HePTP-C2708 , control GST , or GST-SHP2 , and incubated the samples with [ 7-32P ] ATP for 30 min .
As shown in Fig .
40 , active HePTP inhibited p38 profoundly , whereas the inactive C2708 mutant , GST , and the control SHP2 PTPase lacked effects .

The upper panel shows the autoradiogram of the kinase assay .
The expression of Jnk2 and HePTP was visualized by anti-HA tag immunoblotting ( Lower panel ) .
The same result was obtained in several independent experiments .
the tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated , and their activity was measured with GST-ATF2 or GST-c-Jun-N as substrates .
These assays revealed that HePTP reduced both the basal activity of p38 and its further activation ( Fig .
4b ) but not the activation of Jnk2 ( Fig .
4c ) .
The cpm in the GST-ATF2 band were reduced in lane 5 compared with lane 3 by 55 % and in lane 6 compared with lane 4 by 78 % .
The expression of p38 was difficult to evaluate due the similarity in size with HePTP but at least did not appear to be any less in lanes 5 and 6 .
Jnk2 was expressed at relatively low levels but equally in all samples .
We conclude that HePTP inhibits p38 , but not Jnk , in intact cells .
Mapping of the Binding Site in HePTP-The region of HePTP that binds Erk and p38 was first mapped to its noncatalytic N-terminal 92 amino acids .
A GST fusion protein of HePTP lacking this region ( GST-AN ) failed to bind any Tyr ( P ) -containing proteins , Erk , or p38 ( Fig .
50 ) in lysates of Jurkat T cells .
In contrast , a GST fusion protein containing only the N-terminal 92 amino acids of HePTP ( GST-N ter ) bound both Erk and p38 ( Fig .
56 ) .
To determine the binding region more precisely , we made three smaller constructs encompassing amino acids 1-40 , 10-55 , 30-80 , respectively .
These three GST fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates , washed extensively , and immunoblotted for the presence of Erk and 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 11698 HePTP Binds and Dephosphorylates MAP Kinase a b C Fic .

p38 .
As shown in Fig .
5¢ , the two first fragments bound both Erk and p38 readily , whereas the third did not .
We conclude that the binding site must reside within amino acids 10-30 , perhaps extending into the 30-40 region , which is not sufficient for binding by itself .
Phosphorylation of the N terminus of HePTP by MAP Ki-nase-This region also contains two potential phosphorylation sites for a proline-directed kinase ( such as Erk ) , Ser-72 , and Thr-45 .
Because HePTP was readily phosphorylated on both serine and threonine by the bound Erk and p38 ( Fig .
36 ) and by recombinant Erk2 ( Fig .
6a ) or p38 ( not shown ) , we mutated these residues to alanines and examined their phosphorylation by tryptic peptide mapping , which revealed that both peptides containing Ser ( P ) ( peptides 1 and 2 ) contained Ser-72 , whereas Thr-45 was the phosphorylated residue in peptides 3-5 ( Fig .
6b ) .
These peptides were also seen in tryptic peptide maps of HePTP from metabolically °°P ; -labeled T cells but were missing in a HePTP-T45A/S872A mutant ( not shown ) .
Thus , the noncatalytic N terminus of HePTP binds Erk and p38 and is phosphorylated at Ser-72 and Thr-45 by these kinases .
Possible Role of Phosphorylation at Thr-45 and Ser-72-The phosphorylation of the N terminus of HePTP by the Erk or p38 kinases introduces the possibility of a regulatory role of this event .
Measurement of the catalytic activity of HePTP revealed a small decrease in activity upon phosphorylation by Erk ( not shown ) .
This decrease is presently of questionable significance .
Instead , we addressed the possibility that phosphorylation regulates the physical association between HePTP and Erk or p38 .
Because a GST-N ter protein having both the T45A and ST7T2A mutations still bound Erk and p38 as readily as the wild-type GST-N ter protein ( Fig .
56 ) , it seems that the hydroxyl groups of Thr-45 and Ser-72 or their phosphorylation are not required for binding of Erk or p38 .
To test the opposite , namely that phosphorylation is involved in dissociation of the kinases , we incubated HePTP-Erk complexes in the presence of ATP and Mg** at 37°C and measured the release of HePTP .
These experiments utilized catalytically active GST-Erk2 adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose with bound HA-tagged HePTP-C2708 from transfected Jurkat T cells and resulted in a time-dependent dissociation of HePTP from the beads ( Fig .
6c ) .
Thus , the N terminus of HePTP binds Erk and p38 but may release them upon phosphorylation .
Curiously , both phosphorylation sites are outside the minimal necessary binding site for Erk and p38 , but their phosphorylation could influence the 4 & ffff conformation of the binding site .
Elimination of the Phosphorylation Sites Augments Inhibition of MAP Kinase by HePTP-To study the impact of phosphorylation of HePTP at Thr-45 and Ser-72 in intact cells , we generated a mutant in which both residues were replaced by alanine residues .
The mutant , HePTP-T45A/872A , was included in a co-transfection experiment similar to that in Fig .
1f using JCaM1 cells .
As shown in Fig .
6d , wild-type HePTP reduced the anti-CD3-induced activity of Erk2 to about half , whereas HePTP-C27058 augmented it .
In contrast , HePTP-T45A/ST72A was more efficient than wild-type HePTP and essentially eliminated any increase in MAP kinase activation in the anti-CD3 stimulated cells .
Thus , it is clear that phosphorylation of HePTP at Thr-45 and/or Ser-72 is not required for inhibition of MAP kinase .
Rather , it seems that phosphorylation has the opposite effect , namely to lessen the inhibitory effect of HePTP .
This fits our hypothesis that phosphorylation causes a dissociation of Erk from HePTP ; the T45A/S72A mutant would not allow bound Erk to escape , and the inhibition of Erk activation would be stronger .
DISCUSSION Taken together , our findings show that HePTP , a strictly Tyr ( P ) -specific protein phosphatase , forms a physical complex through a small region in its unique N terminus with the Erk and p38 MAP kinases .
Because HePTP very efficiently dephosphorylates these kinases and inactivates them in vitro , it seems that the physical association serves to position HePTP correctly for this catalysis .
The small amount of HePTP required for MAP kinase inactivation in vitro and the reduction in Erk phosphorylation and activity in intact T cells transfected with HePTP indicate that this function of HePTP is physiologically significant .
This conclusion is also supported by the finding that HePTP is readily phosphorylated by Erk and p38 at Thr-45 and Ser-72 , both of which are phosphorylated in intact cells .
Finally , very similar conclusions were recently drawn using mast cells from mice deficient in HePTP . ''
Together these observations indicate that the role of HePTP is to negatively regulate the Erk and p38 MAP kinases in hematopoietic cells .
Whether the related PTPases STEP and PCPTP1 carry out this task in other cell types remains to be determined .
Both share an N-terminal sequence with a high degree of homology to the ® B. Zanke , personal communication .

It is well established that MAP kinases are the targets for dual-specificity phosphatases ( 35-37 ) in T cells ; particularly , the Pacl phosphatase ( 86 ) .

induced and synthesized some 30-60 min after receptor liga-tion ( 35 , 36 ) .
Thus , they are unlikely to be responsible for suppression of MAP kinases in resting T lymphocytes or during early time points of T cell activation .
It has been shown also in other cell types that the inactivation of MAP kinases precedes the induction of dual-specificity phosphatases and that a cytosolic PTP ase is involved ( 38 , 39 ) .
In the budding yeast , Saccha-romyces cerevisiae , the mating pheromone-induced activation of the MAP kinases Fus3p and Kss1p is tightly regulated by the concerted action of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase Msg5p and the conventional PTPases Ptp2p and Ptp3p ( 40 ) .
In this system , the latter are responsible for the basal suppression of the MAP kinases and for terminating their ligand-induced activation .
In contrast , the dual-specificity phosphatase is encoded by an inducible gene , and the role of the enzyme is primarily to dephosphorylate the MAP kinases at later time points ( `` recovery '' ) .
Our findings suggest that a mammalian PTPase , HePTP , is a functional homologue of Ptp2p and Ptp3p and is responsible for basal dephosphorylation and control at early time points .
Lymphocyte activation is initiated by the action of several protein-tyrosine kinases ( 41 , 42 ) and is very likely to be negatively regulated by a number of PTPases ( 43 ) .
Only one such PTPase is currently known , namely SHPI1 ( 44 , 45 ) , which dephosphorylates receptor-associated signaling molecules .
Here we show that HePTP functions at a distinct step to negatively regulate lymphocyte activation .
In contrast to SHP1 , HePTP has a high degree of specificity for Erk and perhaps p38 MAP kinases and does not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation events upstream of these kinases .
This specificity is due , in part , to a strong physical association of HePTP with Erk and p38 , an interaction that is constitutive and occurs through the unphos-phorylated N terminus of HePTP .
We suggest that upon activation of Erk by Mek , the activated Erk either rapidly phosphorylates Thr-45 and Ser-72 , dissociates ( perhaps also because of other mechanisms ) , and escapes into the nucleus to phosphorylate its nuclear substrates .
A fraction of the activated Erk molecules , however , are rapidly inactivated by the bound HePTP .
As determined by immunofluorescence , HePTP appears to remain exclusively cytosolic ( Ref .
10 ) '' and , thus , unable to inactivate MAP kinase molecules in the nucleus .
Instead , these are later inactivated by the nuclear dual-specificity phosphatases , which are absent in resting T cells but are induced within 30-60 min of T cell activation .
This sequential phosphatase model ( Fig .
7 ) provides a flexible mechanism for the regulation and fine-tuning of MAP kinases , which function as crucial signal integration and decision points in T cell activation as well as in growth and stress responses in many other cell types .
Our model predicts a potential role for HePTP in positive selection of T cells in the thymus ( 46 ) , cytokine pro 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 11700 HePTP Binds and Dephosphorylates MAP Kinase duction ( 27 , 47 ) , T cell proliferation ( 48 ) , or anergy ( 49 ) and potentially in other MAP kinase-dependent aspects of T cell differentiation and activation .
