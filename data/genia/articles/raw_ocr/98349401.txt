6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; Fibrinogen Activates NF-rB Transcription Factors in Mononuclear Phagocytes ' Robert G. Sitrin , '' * Pauline M. Pan , * Sujata Srikanth , * and Robert F. Todd III ' Adhesion to extracellular matrices is known to modulate leukocyte activation , although the mechanisms are not fully understood .
Mononuclear phagocytes are exposed to fibrinous provisional matrix throughout migration into inflammatory foci , so this study was undertaken to determine whether fibrinogen triggers activation of NF-KB transcription factors .
U937 cells differentiated with PMA in nonadherent culture were shown to express two fibrinogen-binding integrins , predominately CD11b/CD18 , and to a lesser extent , CD11c/CD18 .
Cells stimulated with fibrinogen ( 10-100 pg/ml ) /Mn*®* ( 50 uM ) for 2 h were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
NF-xB activation , minimal in unstimulated cells , was substantially up-regulated by fibrinogen .
Fibrinogen also caused activation of AP-1 , but not SP1 or cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) factors .
Blocking mAbs against CD18 and CD11b abrogated fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation .
To determine the effects on transcriptional regulation , U937 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV-1 enhancer ( bearing two NF-KB sites ) coupled to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter .
Cells were subsequently stimulated with 1 ) PMA for 24 b , inducing CAT activity by 2.6-fold , 2 ) fibrinogen/Mn** for 2 b , inducing CAT activity by 3.2-fold , or 3 ) costimulation with fibrinogen and PMA , inducing 5.7-fold the CAT activity induced by PMA alone .
We conclude that contact with fibrinogen-derived proteins may contribute to mononuclear phagocyte activation by signaling through CD11b/CD18 , resulting in selective activation of transcriptional regulatory factors , including NF-KB .
The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 1462-1470. they respond to chemotaxins and emigrate from the vas- cular space into inflammatory foci ( reviewed in Refs .
1-3 ) .
This sequence of events has been characterized extensively , although important mechanisms at every phase of this process remain undefined .
Under conditions of shear stress , selectins initiate contact with the endothelium , producing rolling adhesion , followed by firm adhesion , mediated in large part by 3 , integrins ( 3 ) .
The intensity of an inflammatory reaction is determined by both the extent of leukocyte recruitment and the proinflammatory actions of the migrating leukocytes .
Accordingly , the coupling mechanisms that integrate leukocyte recruitment with signaling pathways for cellular activation have received considerable attention .
Clearly , leukocyte activation signaling can proceed in nonadherent cells , but engagement of adhesion proteins modifies the activation process ( 4 , 5 ) .
For example , monocyte tethering to endothelial cell P-selectin may not only immobilize the cell but also serve as a potent costimulus for secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and TNF-a in association with activation of NF- « B transcription regulatory factors ( 6 ) .
Engagement of B , integrins can trigger activation signaling ( 7 ) , although the capacity for activation signaling directly through B ; , integrins is less clearly defined ( 5 ) .
CR3 ( Mac-1 , ay , CD11bVCD18 ) , a B , integrin critically involved in adhesion , locomotion , chemotaxis , and phagocytosis , serves as a receptor for a diverse group of ligands , including iC3b , ICAM-1 , I eukocytes utilize a complex array of adhesion proteins as *Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Division and *Hematology-Oncology Divi-sion , Department of Internal Medicine , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI 48109 Received for publication December 11 , 1997 .

Fibrinogen is also a ligand for a limited number of other adhesion proteins , including the B ; , integrin CR4 ( p150/95 , CD11c/ CD18 ) , « , ; , and platelet GPIIb/IIIa ( 5 , 10 ) .
Interactions between leukocytes and fibrinogen/fibrin may have special importance , since leukocytes commonly encounter provisional matrices rich in fibrinogen and fibrin at sites of inflammation .
There is considerable evidence that the products of coagulation and fibrinolysis profoundly affect many facets of inflammatory reactions , wound heal-ing , and fibrosis ( 11-13 ) .
Likewise , it is well established that contact with fibrinogen or fibrin matrix can dramatically alter the expression of proinflammatory factors such as TNF-a @ , IL-1 , reactive oxygen intermediates , and possibly IL-8 in vitro ( 12 , 14-17 ) .
However , the precise pathways by which fibrinogen and its derivatives modulate leukocyte function are far less understood .
One plausible mechanism by which activation signaling through fibrinogen/fibrin could broadly influence leukocyte function is by activation of pleiotropic transcription regulatory proteins .
NF-kB is a particularly important candidate , since its activation affects a broad array of immediate-early gene products , including TNF- @ , ILs , chemokines , and colony stimulating factors ( reviewed in Refs .
18-21 ) .
NF- « B activation has been demonstrated by engagement of other adhesion proteins such as 3 , integrins , but not by fibrinogen binding or by Ab ligation of B ; , integrins ( 22 ) .
In this study , we sought to determine whether fibrinogen could trigger activation of NF- « B and other transcription regulatory proteins in mononuclear phagocytes .
We demonstrate selective activation of NF-kB and AP-1 by fibrinogen binding in PMA-differentiated U937 cells .
Moreover , it is shown that fibrinogen-triggered NF-KB activation is sufficient to serve as a potent stimulus for NF- « B-dependent gene transcription .

NF-KB oligonucleotides were prepared by the DNA Core Facility , University of Michigan Medical Center .
Cell culture and stimulation The U937 monocytic leukemia cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) .
Cells were propagated in 75-cm '' polystyrene flasks in standard medium consisting of RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) with penicillin ( 100 U/ml ) , streptomycin ( 100 pg/m ! 1 ) , gentamicin ( 100 pg/ml ) , glutamine ( 2 mM ) , and 5 % FBS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) .
To induce morphologic and functional dif-ferentiation , the U937 cells were transferred to 1000-ml Teflon tissue culture bags ( Baxter Healthcare , Deerfield , IL ; 5 X 10 '' cells in 500 ml of medium ) for stimulation with 0.5 nM PMA ( Sigma ) in nonadherent culture and incubated at 37°C , 5 % CO , for 48 h. The cells were then washed and resuspended in 20 mM HEPES/140 mM NaCl/2 mg/m !
glucose/10 pg/ml polymyxin B , with additives as indicated , and returned to 15-ml Teflon tissue culture bags ( American Fluoroseal , Columbia , MD ) until the cells were harvested to prepare samples for EMSA or CAT assays .
Immunofluorescence flow cytometry Cells were resuspended in staining buffer ( PBS with 1 % BSA , 0.1 % sodium azide , pH 7.4 ) and incubated with the relevant primary mAb for 30 min , 4°C , followed by R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG ( 30 min , 4°C ) .
Immunofluorescence flow cytometric analysis was performed with a Coulter electronics EPICSC flow cytometer with a logarithmic amplifier ( Coulter , Miami , FL ; Flow Cytometry Core Facility , University of Michigan Medical Center ) .
The percent of positive cells was determined , using cells stained in parallel with an irrelevant isotype-matched primary Ab as background controls .
EMSA Activation of NF-KB transcription factors was measured by EMSA ( adapt-ed from Ref .
23 ) .
Nuclear proteins were extracted by the method of Schre-iber et al .
( 24 ) with minor modifications .
After a preliminary wash in Tris-buffered saline , the cells were pelleted and washed twice in 10 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , with 10 mM KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and 0.5 mM PMSF , and incubated in a volume at 0°C for 15 min .
Five microliters of 1 % Nonidet P-40 was then added , and the nuclei were pelleted at 15,000 X g. The pellet was resuspended in 75 pl of 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , with 0.4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and 1 mM PMSF , and incubated for 30 min at 4°C .
The nuclei were pelleted once again at 15,000 X g , 4°C , and the supernatant was stored at -70°C .
Nuclear extracts ( 5-10 ug protein in 10 gl ) were incubated for 15 min , 25°C , with 10 pl reaction mixture ( 100 mM Tris Cl , pH 7.5 , 1 M NaCl , 50 mM DTT , 10 mM EDTA , 40 % glycerol , 1 mg/ml BSA ( nuclease free ) , 50 ng/ml double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) ) , and incubated with *°P end-labeled NF-KB consensus oligonucleotide ( 5'-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG-3 ' ) ( 6 ) , or AP-1 consensus oligo TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3 ' ) , SP1 consensus oligo , ( 5-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3 ' ) , or CREB consensus oligo ( 5-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3 ' ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnologies ) .
The reaction mixture was run on a 4 % PAGE gel in high ionic strength buffer ( 0.05 M Tris , pH 8.5 , 380 mM glycine , 2 mM EDTA ) , and developed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager ( Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Binding of nuclear protein ( s ) to the labeled oligonucleotide was demonstrated by visualizing discrete bands of DNA-protein complexes with retarded mobility in the PAGE gel .
Binding of labeled oligonucleotides was shown to be se-quence-specific by demonstrating that binding was 1 ) blocked by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide and 2 ) unaffected by an excess of a control oligonucleotide of identical length and base composition , but a randomized 3 Abbreviations used in this paper : EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; CREB , cAMP response element-binding protein ; LTR , long terminal repeat ; Fbg , fibrinogen ; wt , wild-type .
1463 sequence .
All the key findings shown were confirmed with EMSA of the nuclear extracts prepared from at least two independently run experiments .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays U937 cells were harvested during logarithmic growth and transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV-1 enhancer ( bearing two NF- « B sites ) linked to a CAT reporter , which was generously provided by Dr. Gary Nabel , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of Michigan ( 25 ) .
Transfection was achieved by electroporation , using 15 ug of DNA for 10 '' cells at 300 V and 1000 F. The cells were returned to culture for 24 h , at which time they were transferred to 15-ml Teflon culture bags and stimulated either with PMA ( 0-5 nM ) + fibrinogen ( 50 ug/ml ! )
for 24 h , or fibrinogen ( 50 pg/ml ) with Mn** ( 50 uM ) for 2 h , in serum-free medium ( Mac-SFM , Life Technologies ) .
Control cells cultured in parallel were mock transfected or transfected with the HIV-1-CAT construct and cultured in medium supplemented with 5 % FBS .
As a further control , cells were also transfected with a « B mutant HIV-1-CAT plasmid and stimulated with PMA + fibrinogen as above .
After culture for 24 h , cell lysates were adjusted for protein content and assayed for CAT activity as described previously ( 26 ) .
Briefly , lysates were incubated with 0.025 Ci of p-threo- [ dichloroacetyl-1-'*C ] chloramphenicol ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) and 1.38 mM acetyl coenzyme A at 37°C for 24 h. The chloramphenicol was separated from its acetylated products by thin layer chromatog-raphy ( TLC ) .
The TLC plates were then analyzed with a PhosphorImager , and the percentage of acetylation was determined with Image Quant software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Results PMA-induced differentiation of U937 cells Preliminary experiments verified that there was weak NF-KB activation in undifferentiated U937 cells in response to LPS ( not shown ) .
Therefore , U937 cells were induced to differentiate by stimulation with a low concentration of PMA ( 0.5 nM ) for 48 h. Under these conditions , nuclear NF- « B activity remained very low , provided that the cells were maintained in nonadherent culture ( Fig .
1 ) , whereas contact with any adhesive surfaces such as polystyrene induced significant NF- « B activation ( not shown ) .
In addition , the PMA-differentiated cells became quite responsive to LPS , demonstrating a strong NF-KB response ( Fig .
1 ) .
Fibrinogen-induced activation of NF- « B PMA-differentiated U937 cells were stimulated with fibrinogen ( 50 ug/m1 ) in nonadherent culture for 2 h , at which time nuclear proteins were extracted for EMSA assay .
Where indicated , the medium was supplemented with MnCl , ( 50 M ) to ensure that cation-dependent integrins were optimally activated ( 27 ) .
As shown in Figure 14 , fibrinogen induced substantial NF- « B activation in the presence of Mn* ' , even in comparison with LPS stimulation , which was included as a positive control .
The effect of fibrinogen was dose related , since NF- « B activation was first evident with as little as 10 pg/ml , with a substantial response occurring with 25 pg/ml , a maximal response with 50 pg/ml , and a plateau effect extending through 100 pg/ml !
( Fig .
1B ) .
Time course studies indicate that fibrinogen-induced NF- « B activation was rapid and transient , with a maximal response after 1 and 2 h of stimulation , and a prompt return to baseline within 4 h. By contrast , LPS-induced NF-KB activation was somewhat slower to evolve , with a maximal response developing within the 1- and 2-h time points .
Like the response to fibrinogen , NF-KB activation then returned to baseline within 4 h ( not shown ) .
All these experiments were conducted in the presence of polymyxin B to block the effects of endotoxin , even though the reagents or media contained no more than 0.01 EU/ml .
This corresponded to less than 1 ng/ml of the LPS used as a positive control , an amount that produces minimal , if any , NF- « B activation ( not shown ) .
It was also confirmed that polymyxin B did not affect the NF- « B activation produced by fibrinogen but significantly reduced the magnitude of the response to LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )

Finally , fibrinogen activated NF- « B in undifferentiated U937 cells ( Fig .
8 ; see below ) , while , as noted above , LPS produced a weak NF- « B response unless the cells were pretreated with PMA .
These distinctions confirm that LPS contamination was not responsible for fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation .
Characterization of fibrinogen-induced NF- « B proteins Experiments were next performed to characterize the specific NF- « B proteins induced by fibrinogen .
First , cold competition studies were used to determine which protein-DNA complexes on EMSA are sequence specific .
For both LPS- and fibrinogen-stimulated cells , a single complex was formed , with the labeled NF-KB consensus oligo , that was completely blocked by an excess of cold oligo but was unaffected by a cold oligo with a randomized sequence ( Fig .
34 ) .
Antibody supershifting was performed to further characterize the composition of the NF- « B complex ( Fig .
3B ) .

Elimination of endotoxin contamination as a cause of fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation .
Fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation is not suppressed by inclusion of polymyxin B ( 10 ug/ml ! )
in the medium , while NF-KB activation in response to LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) is significantly reduced .
Detailed views of EMSA assays are shown as in Figure 1 , with the band of NF- « B-specific binding indicated by the arrowhead .
Ab , which cross-reacts with p52 , eliminated the lower portion of the complex , and slightly attenuated the density of the upper portion of the complex .
The anti-p65 ( Rel A ) Ab , which cross-reacts with c-Rel , eliminated the upper portion of this complex , leaving only a minor band constituting the lower portion of the complex .
Finally , inclusion of both Abs virtually eliminated the entire NF- « B band .
Thus , the demonstrated band of NF- « B-specific binding stimulated by fibrinogen is comprised of a mixture of NF- « B forms .
The less prominent , lower portion of the band consists of dimers containing p50 and/or p52 , while the majority of the NF- « B proteins , representing the upper portion of the band , consists of dimers containing Rel-A and/or c-Rel .
Given that the anti-p50/p52 Ab slightly reduced the density of the upper portion of the band , it is likely that some heterodimers containing p50/p52 and Rel-A/c-Rel are present here as well .
In these respects , the NF-kB binding proteins extracted from fibrinogen-stimulated cells appeared identical in composition to those extracted from LPS-treated cells .
Recent studies have suggested that a distinct class of NF-KB sites , represented in the IL-8 and tissue factor genes , do not bind p65/p50 heterodimers but selectively bind c-Rel/p65 dimers ( 28 ) , offering a potential mechanism for selective gene regulation by NF- « B .
To determine whether fibrinogen and LPS induced similar proportions of p65 vs c-Rel , supershifting experiments were performed with a c-Rel-specific Ab that does not cross-react with Rel-A ( Santa Cruz No .
se-1827 ) .
The anti-p50/p52 Ab was always included in these experiments so only the p65/c-Rel reactive band would remain .
The density of the p65/c-Rel band was then examined with and without supershifting by the anti-c-Rel-specific Ab .
Because the c-Rel Ab only partially reduced the density of the p65/c-Rel band , the results were analyzed by densitometry , using ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Supershifting with anti-c-Rel reduced the density of the p65/c-Rel band by 28.7 + 6.8 % in extracts of fibrinogen-stimulated cells , and by 27.5 + 6.1 % in extracts of LPS-stimulated cells , indicating that fibrinogen and LPS induce activation of c-Rel- vs Rel-A-con-taining dimers in similar proportions .

By contrast , cold competition with an excess of unlabeled random sequence control oligo had no effect on the NF- « B-specific complex .

Nuclear protein extracts prepared from cells stimulated with fibrinogen/Mn** ( Zeff ) or LPS ( right ) were incubated with *°P-NF-xB oligo in the presence of Abs reactive against the p50 and p52 forms ( anti-p50 ) , the p65 ( Rel A ) and c-Rel ( anti-p65 ) forms , or both .
The NF- « B-specific complex ( arrowheads ) is composed of a mixture of NF- « B forms , as the lower portion of the band is removed by the anti-p50 Ab , while the more prominent upper portion of the band is removed by the anti-p65 Ab , and both Abs together eliminate the band almost completely .
Selectivity of NF-KB activation To determine whether fibrinogen/Mn** broadly induces activation of transcriptional regulatory factors , EMSA assays were also performed using consensus oligonucleotides for AP-1 , SP1 , and CONTROL Fbg/Mn LPS AP-1 CONTROL Fbg/Mn - LPS < » ta Cp NF- < xB 1465 CREB .
As shown in Figure 4 , fibrinogen/Mn '' * produced a substantial increase in AP-1 activation that was highly consistent but not as prominent as the effect produced by LPS .
However , fibrinogen/Mn** did not affect binding of SP1 or CREB , even though activation of both factors was evident in nuclear extracts of LPS-stimulated cells .
These findings indicate that signaling through fibrinogen/Mn '' * yields a limited and selective array of activated transcriptional regulatory factors .
Nonetheless , the broad representation of NF- « B and AP-1 regulatory elements in the enhancer regions of immediate-early gene products and other proinflammatory mediators justifies the expectation that fibrinogen-induced activation of both NF- « B and AP-1 families should have wide-rang-ing effects on expression of genes that are tightly regulated during inflammation and wound healing .
CR3 mediates fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation One of the more notable properties of fibrinogen-mediated NF- « B activation was that the effect was seen only in Mn '' ' -supplemented medium ( Fig .
5 ) .
Fibrinogen ( 50 pg/m ! )
in HEPES-buffered saline/ glucose without Mn** had no appreciable effect on NF- « B activation .
Likewise , the presence of MnCl , ( 50 uM ) alone did not induce NF-KB activation .
Preliminary experiments indicated that the 50 uM concentration of MnCl , was optimal for supporting NF-B activation ( not shown ) .
This was quite similar to the Mn** concentration that maximally activates LFA-1 in the same buffer system ( 29 ) , in keeping with the suggestion that the requirement for Mn * reflected the conditions that optimized ligation to fibrinogen-binding integrins .
Immunofluorescence flow cytometry was performed to assess the expression of integrins capable of serving as fibrinogen recep-tors , namely CR3 ( CD11b/CD18 ) , CR4 ( CD11c/CD18 ) , and a , $ B ; .
GPIIb/IIIa ( CD41b/CD61 ) , which shares epitope ( s ) and function with CR3 , was not assessed , since it is expressed by platelets and megakaryocytes and not by mononuclear phagocytes ( 30 ) .
Using clone 44 anti-CD11b mAb , it was determined that 62 + 11 % of PMA-stimulated cells expressed CR3 ( mean + SEM ) , while CR4 expression , although significant , was limited to 34 + 7 % of cells ( using clone 3.9 anti-CD11c mAb ) .
The staining intensities for both CD11b and CD11c were broadly distributed , so these percentages may be underestimates , excluding cells with relatively low levels of integrin expression and including only those with fluorescence intensities clearly exceeding control cells stained with irrelevant primary Abs .
There was negligible expression of « , f , ( 1.5 + 0.3 % positive cells ) .
Finally , expression of the urokinase CONTROL Fbg/Mn LPS SP1 oul CONTROL Fbg/Mn CREB FIGURE 4 .

Nuclear protein extracts prepared from 1 ) unstimulated control cells , 2 ) cells stimulated with fibrinogen/Mn* , and 3 ) cells stimulated with LPS were assayed by EMSA , using consensus oligonucleotides for NF- « B , AP-1 , SP1 , and CREB .
Fibrinogen/Mn®* increased binding to NF- « B and AP-1 oligonucleotides but had no effect on SP1 or CREB , even though both of these were induced by LPS .

Fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation is dependent on the presence of Mn * .
Detailed views of EMSA assays are shown as in Figure 1 , with the band of NF- « B-specific binding indicated by the arrowhead .
NF-KB activation was induced only by fibrinogen ( 50 pg/ml ) in the presence of Mn** ( 50 uM ) , and not by either fibrinogen or Mn** alone .
receptor ( uPAR ; CD87 ) was also assessed , since uPAR associates with many integrins , including CR3 and CR4 , and this association strongly influences integrin-mediated adhesion , including CR3-mediated adhesion of human monocytes to fibrinogen ( 31-33 ) .
Detectable uPAR was found on 71 + 10 % of cells , confirming their availability for interactions with integrins .
The presence of these two fibrinogen-binding 3 , integrins , coupled with a requirement for a divalent cation ( Mn ' ) , which is characteristic of B ; , integrins , indirectly implicated CR3 and/or CR4 as candidate receptors responsible for fibrinogen-induced NF-KB .
Confirmatory studies were next performed to determine which integrin ( s ) might be responsible for fibrinogen-induced NF- « B activation by blocking the response selectively with a series of mAbs .
In these experiments , the cells were pretreated with mAb ( 100 ug/ml ) for 30 min before adding fibrinogen/Mn®* .
Monoclonal Abs were also added with the fibrinogen/Mn** to maintain the concentration at 100 pg/ml throughout the 2-h incubation before nuclear protein extraction .
As shown in Figure 6 , the addition of either an anti-CD18 mAb ( clone TS1/18 ) or an anti-CD11b mAb ( clone OKM1 ) completely abrogated the NF-KB response to fibrinogen/Mn** .
Control mAbs had no effect on NF- « B activation .
Likewise , the anti-CD11¢c mAb ( clone 2E1 ) was ineffective , suggesting that CR3 , and not CR4 , is the receptor predominately responsible for fibrinogen-induced NF- « B activation .
It is interesting to note that while OKM1 blocked NF-KB activation com-pletely , clone 44 , an anti-CD11b mAb that reacts with an epitope located in the I domain , had no effect at all ( not shown ) .
This agrees closely with prior studies indicating that OKM1 preferentially blocks binding of soluble fibrinogen to CR3 , while I-domain Abs such as clone 44 preferentially block cellular adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen ( 8 , 9 , 34 ) .
Augmented transcription of the HIV-1 enhancer by costimulation with fibrinogen To determine whether stimulation with fibrinogen is sufficient to modulate NF- « B-driven gene transcription , U937 cells were transfected with an HIV-1 enhancer-CAT construct , as described in Materials and Methods .
Prior studies have shown that transcription of this construct is refractory to further modulation once the cells are differentiated into a more mature phenotype ( 25 ) .
Accordingly , these experiments were performed without pretreating the cells FIBRINOGEN-INDUCED NF- « B ACTIVATION Control Fbg/Mn - Control Fbg/Mn _ Control Fbg/Mn > MW ma an > was a No mAb + anti-CD18 mAb _ +anti-CD11ib mAb Control Fbg/Mn m # ~ : as + anti-CD11c mAb Control Fbg/Mn + Control mAb FIGURE 6 .

The anti-CD11¢c mAb ( 2E1 ) did not inhibit NF-KB activation .
Likewise , none of the isotype-matched control mAbs had any effect ( only the IgG1 control is shown ) .
In all instances , cells were pretreated with 100 ug/ml concentrations of mAb , which was maintained throughout subsequent stimulation with fibrinogen/Mn** .

with PMA .
Preliminary experiments confirmed that control cells ( transfected , but otherwise unstimulated ) expressed very low levels of CAT activity minimally above the background activities of mock-transfected cells ( electroporated , no plasmid ) , indicating that transfection with the NF- « B/CAT plasmid alone resulted in little cellular activation ( not shown ) .
Figure 74A shows that stimulation with PMA alone for 24 h had only a limited effect on CAT activity .
Only the highest concentration of PMA , 5 nM , produced a statistically significant increase in CAT activity ( 2.6-fold ) , relative to unstimulated controls .
By contrast , cells stimulated with fibrinogen ( 50 ug/ml ) , in the presence of Mn '' * ( 50 M ) for only 2 h and then returned to serum-free medium for the remainder of a 24-h culture , yielded a statistically significant increase in CAT expression , 3.2-fold relative to unstimulated controls ( Fig .
7A ) .
Experiments were also performed to determine whether fibrinogen was an effective costimulus with PMA in inducing CAT expression .
In these experiments , cells were cultured with varying concentrations of PMA + fibrinogen for 24 h in serum-free medium .
Mn** was omitted from these experiments since concurrent stimulation with PMA was deemed adequate to activate fibrinogen-binding integrins ( 35 ) .
As shown in Figure 7B , costimulation with fibrinogen significantly enhanced CAT activity for all concentrations of PMA tested .
The peak effect of fibrinogen was seen with 0.5 nM PMA , producing 5.7-fold the CAT activity achieved by stimulation with PMA alone .
This protocol was repeated with cells transfected with a HIV-1 enhancer-CAT construct with both NF- « B sites inactivated ( Fig .
7B ) .
Under these circumstances , fibrinogen costimulation did not influence CAT expression at all , indicating that the effect is clearly NF- « B dependent .
Finally , we wished to determine whether other serum proteins could serve the same costimulatory function as fibrinogen .
Therefore , cells transfected with the NF- « B-intact HIV enhancer-CAT construct were stimulated with PMA ( 0.5 nM ) with and without 5 % FBS .
The addition of serum had no costimulatory effect on CAT expression ( Fig .
6B ) , indicating that fibrinogen has a selective effect on NF- « B-dependent gene expression that is not shared broadly by other circulating proteins .
It was notable that the maximal effect of fibrinogen as a costimulus with PMA , a 5.7-fold induction , was roughly twice the 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; The Journal of Immunology J > 4 7 ] * A E 4 * cie O 6 C 3 E 2 & 4 -G < T F— < I 4 ] o 0.50 5.0 Fbg/Mn PMA ( nM ) 8 - * s | 35 C o 4 O 6 4 J 0 $ & 0 5 3 44 .

Cells transfected with the wild-type HIV-1/CAT plasmid were stimulated with PMA ( 0.05-5.0 nM ) for 24 h , or with fibrinogen ( 50 ug/tal ) /Mn®* ( 50 uM ) for 2 h , followed by incubation in serum-free medium for 22 h. CAT activities of the cell lysates were normalized to the activities of transfected , but otherwise unstimulated , controls .

Therefore , costimulation with PMA and fibrinogen was analyzed by EMSA to determine whether the nuclear levels of NF- « B proteins at 2 h parallel the demonstrated effects on CAT expression at 24 h. Previously untreated U937 cells were treated with 5.0 and 0.5 nM PMA , or with fibrinogen ( 50 pg/ml ) /Mn '' * ( 50 uM ) , for 2 h. PMA alone produced only a modest degree of 1467 NF- « B activation by EMSA assay , while fibrinogen/Mn '' * produced a substantial level of NF-KB activation , even in undifferentiated U937 cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
The combination of PMA ( 0.5 nM ) and fibrinogen/Mn* * reproducibly yielded a level of NF-KB activation that was only minimally greater than fibrinogen/Mn®* alone .
Therefore , PMA and fibrinogen do not have additive effects on NF- « B activation that can account for the enhanced effect of fibrinogen on CAT expression .
However , conditions were chosen to maximize the short-term effects of PMA and fibrinogen/Mn** , so it remains possible that costimulation with PMA and fibrinogen over 24 h affects NF-KB activation in ways that are not reflected in short term stimulation analyzed by EMSA .
It is also possible that the costimulatory effect of PMA modulates other transcriptional regulatory factors or downstream steps in CAT synthesis that compliment fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation .
Discussion These studies demonstrate that fibrinogen is capable of triggering substantial activation of NF-KB transcription regulatory factors in undifferentiated and PMA-differentiated U937 mononuclear phagocytes .
The composition of NF- « B-binding proteins closely resembled the profile induced by activation with LPS , in that dimers containing p65 and c-REL were the dominant forms , with a minor contribution by dimers composed of p50 and p52 ( Fig .
3B ) .
Under the conditions employed , fibrinogen was able to produce this response only in the presence of Mn** .
which suggested that an integrin adhesion protein serves as the fibrinogen receptor .
Many prior studies have indicated that CR3 ( Mac-1 ; CD11b/ CD18 ) , a B , integrin , is the dominant fibrinogen-binding receptor on mononuclear phagocytes ( 8 , 9 , 36 ) , while another ; integrin , CR4 ( 150/95 ; CD11¢/CD18 ) , can also bind fibrinogen ( 10 ) .
Flow cytometry experiments indicate that the PMA-differentiated U937 cells used in most experiments in the present study expressed predominately CR3 ( 62 % of cells ) , although there was an appreciable representation of CR4 as well ( 34 % of cells ) .
The use of blocking mAbs further verify that CR3 is the dominant , if not sole , receptor responsible for fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation .
The NF- « B response to fibrinogen/Mn** was completely negated by Abs to CD18 and CD11b .
By contrast , fibrinogen-induced NF- « B activation was preserved in the presence of anti-CD11¢c mAb .
The absence of a blocking effect with a single Ab is not itself convincing , but , together with the absence of any residual NF- « B activation in the presence of anti-CD11b mAb , it is unlikely that CR4 contributed significantly to fibrinogen-induced NF-KB activation .
Given the overlap in ligand specificities and the structural similarities between CR3 and CR4 , these functional dissimilarities are striking and offer the opportunity to further explore the distinct roles these integrins may play in adhesion/activation coupling .
Alternatively , it is possible that the level of CR4 expression achieved under these experimental conditions was simply insufficient to mediate NF- « B activation .
The functional implications of this NF- « B activation was demonstrated by the markedly enhanced transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR-CAT construct in response to fibrinogen , both as a lone stimulus ( 3.2-fold the activity of unstimulated controls ; Fig .
7 ) and as a potent costimulus with PMA , where the resulting CAT activities were enhanced by fibrinogen at all PMA concentrations tested , optimally augmenting CAT expression by 5.7-fold .
None of these effects were observed when the cells were transfected with a construct lacking functional NF-KB sites .
While it is certainly possible that both PMA and fibrinogen may have effects other than NF- « B activation that enhance expression of the HIV-1 LTR-CAT 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; 1468 FIBRINOGEN-INDUCED NF- « B ACTIVATION -ma - # m Control PMA PMA 5 nM 0.5 nM Fbg/Mn __ Fbg/Mn + PMA 0.5 nM FIGURE 8 .
- Effects of PMA and fibrinogen on NF-B activation .
Cells ( without prior differentiation with PMA ) were stimulated with PMA ( 5.0 and 0.5 nM ) for 2 h , with fibrinogen ( 50 ug/ml ) /Mn®* ( 50 uM ) for 2 h , or with the combination of PMA ( 0.5 nM ) + fibrinogen ( 50 ug/ml ) /Mn®* ( 50 uM ) for 2 h , and assayed by EMSA using the consensus NF-KB oligonucleotide .
PMA alone induced a significant degree of NF- « B activation , as did fibrinogen ( 50 pg/mal ) /Mn** ( 50 M ) in undifferentiated cells .
The combination of PMA and fibrinogen yielded a level of NF-KB activation that was only marginally greater than fibrinogen/Mn '' * alone .
construct , it is clear that the effect is entirely dependent on the functionality of NF-KB .
There are a few features of the model used in the EMSA experiments ( PMA-pretreatment of U937 cells for 48 h ) that merit specific comment .
Preliminary experiments demonstrated that untreated U937 cells exhibited poor NF- « B activation over 2 h in response an archetypal agonist such as LPS .
Prior work has shown that pretreating U937 cells with PMA for 24 h induces sustained and constitutive NF- « B ( 25 ) .
The key methodologic difference in our study is that the U937 cells were maintained in strictly nonadherent culture throughout this incubation .
Preliminary experiments showed that PMA-pretreated U937 cells were exquisitely sensitive to even transient exposure to any adhesive surface ( in-cluding protein-coated or uncoated plastic ) , resulting in near-max-imal NF- « B activation .
This indicates that the emergence of constitutive NF- « B expression during PMA-induced differentiation is itself critically dependent on cellular adhesion .
The very low baseline expression of nuclear NF- « B proteins , combined with a differentiated phenotype ( with relatively high levels of integrin ex-pression ) and the preserved responsiveness to subsequent stimulation ( fibrinogen/Mn** or LPS ) , make this model a highly attractive one for studying the effects of integrins on gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes .
Since adhesion to fibrinogen-coated flasks produced the same high levels of NF- « B activation as contact with uncoated or albumin-coated plastic ( not shown ) , the model is limited in that it is applicable only to studying soluble counterligands and precluded us from examining the effects of immobilized fibrinogen .
Another particularly interesting feature of this model is that fibrinogen induces NF-KB activation even while the cells are kept meticulously in nonadherent conditions , in striking contrast to prior studies suggesting that integrin-mediated activation signaling requires integrin cross-linking , cellular adhesion , and cytoskeletal rearrangement ( 5 ) .
We can not dismiss the possibility that intercellular contact , which can be enhanced by fibrinogen , also contributed to NF- « B activation ( 36 ) .
However , the cells were routinely examined after fibrinogen treatment , and the cells emerged from these cultures in uniform suspensions .
Homo-typic aggregation was not observed ( not shown ) .
The concept that leukocyte integrins can serve as conduits for activation signaling first emerged from observations that these proteins can sample the extracellular environment for extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins , adjacent cells , LPS , and microbial pathogens , and , through transmembrane domains , can provide a physical link to the cytoskeleton and thereby to the machinery of gene expression ( 4 , 5 ) .
Subsequent studies have reinforced this concept by demonstrating that integrin ligation can engage various pathways of intracellular signal transduction .
Many integrins can activate the Na */H * antiporter with a resultant increase in intracellular pH ( 5 ) .
Most integrins tested , including CR3 , can also trigger an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium ( 5 ) .
Ab binding of ; integrins has been shown to trigger immediate-early gene expression and NF-KB activation ( 7 , 22 ) , but a similar approach to signaling through B ; , integrins was unsuccessful ( 7 ) .
Thus far , evidence for activation signaling through PB ; , integrins has been indirect or limited to changes in early signaling mediators such as intracellular calcium .
Contact with fibrinogen-related proteins can induce or enhance expression of immediate-early genes in mononuclear phagocytes , including TNF-a , IL-1 $ , and tissue factor ( 12 , 14 , 15 ) .
All these proteins are subject to regulation by NE- « B , but NF- « B activation was not demonstrated directly in any of these studies .
However , recent work has shown that CR3-transfected fibroblasts are capable of NF-KB activation in response to LPS ( 37 ) .
Local activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways , virtually ubiquitous at inflammatory foci , is deeply insinuated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory tissue injury and repair .
Fibrinogen and its derivative products are involved in the adhesion , spreading , and movement of many cell types involved in wound repair , including fibroblasts , endothelial , cells , and epithelial cells ( 38-40 ) .
It is also expected that leukocytes will encounter fibrinogen-related proteins at virtually every phase of the inflammatory response .
Circulating monocytes would certainly be exposed to high concentrations of fibrinogen in plasma .
Monocytes do express some nuclear NF- « B constitutively ( 41 ) , which is clearly not maximal , and monocytes retain responsiveness to fibrinogen in vitro ( 12 , 14-16 ) .
Consistent with the results of the present study ( Fig .
5 ) , it is possible that monocyte CR3 is relatively incapable of mediating NF- « B activation until activated by exposure to chemoattractants , early adhesion , or other signals .
These and other factors that may modulate monocyte responsiveness to plasma fibrinogen certainly merit future study .
Fibrin and platelet deposits accumulate on injured endothelium , particularly under shear stress , providing an adhesive surface for activated leukocytes ( 42 ) .
Fibrinogen can significantly enhance adhesive reactions between monocytes and endothelial cells by acting as a bridge molecule between the CR3 of a mononuclear phagocyte and endothelial ICAM-1 ( 36 ) .
Extravascular fibrinogen is rapidly converted into fibrin deposits that persist as prominent features of many acute and chronic inflammatory reactions .
Fibrinogen may gain access to the extravascular compartment either by exudation of circulating fibrinogen or by frank hemorrhage , which has been shown to induce NF- « B activation in vivo ( 43 ) .
Fibrinogen can also be synthesized locally by epithelial cells ( 44 ) .
Leukocytes contacting fibrin-rich matrices may be directed to alter production of proinflammatory cytokines ( 12 , 15 ) , and , in addition , fibrin degradation products can amplify the inflammatory reaction by serving as chemotaxins ( 45-47 ) .
In the present studies , all experiments were performed with soluble fibrinogen , so it will be necessary to determine whether its derivative forms expected at sites of inflammation , including fibrin monomer , insoluble fibrin polymer , and fibrin degradation products , are equally capable of activating NF- « B and AP-1 .
The fibrinous stroma also influences the architecture of inflamed tissue 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; The Journal of Immunology by limiting hemorrhage , entrapping leukocytes , and providing a provisional matrix for the ingrowth of fibroblasts , and evidence is mounting that impaired local fibrinolysis favors the development of excessive fibrosis rather than restoration of normal tissue structure ( 13 ) .
The results of the present study add to the potential mechanisms by which local fibrin deposition can alter the course of inflammation and healing .
The broad array of genes that are regulated by NF- « B factors include a host of cytokines that participate in leukocyte recruitment and activation , including ILs ( IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-12 ) , TNF-a , chemokines ( IL-8 , growth-related onco-gene protein ( Gro ) a , -B , and -y , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1 , monocyte chemotactic protein ( MCP ) -1 ) , induc-ible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , adhesion proteins ( ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 ) , and viruses ( HIV , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , and ade-novirus ) ( 18 , 21 , 48 ) .
Thus , one can easily hypothesize that the same fibrinogen-integrin interaction that facilitates immobilization and recruitment of leukocytes can , by triggering NF-KB activation , augment the production of cytokines , regulate expression of adhesion proteins , and , possibly , contribute to the persistence and proliferation of viruses .
Indeed , prior studies have shown that HIV-infected leukocytes exhibit enhanced expression of CD11b , increased adhesion , and enhanced replication of HIV when cells adhere to specific components of the extracellular matrix ( 49-51 ) .
It is well recognized that HIV replication can be enhanced by the effects of opportunistic infections , and local deposition of fibrinogen-related proteins at these sites of infection provide yet another potentially important stimulus by which this may occur .
Lastly , NF-KB factors have been implicated in both the induction and prevention of apoptosis , suggesting that fibrinous stroma may influence the longevity of leukocytes and parenchymal cells in inflamed or healing tissues ( 52 ) .
In summary , this study demonstrates that U937 mononuclear phagocytes react to exposure to fibrinogen in vitro with prompt activation of pleiotropic transcription regulatory factors , NF-kB and AP-1 .
The NF-KB response is mediated by CR3 but does not require cellular adhesion .
Finally , fibrinogen , either alone or in concert with PMA , is capable of supporting substantially enhanced transcriptional activity of a NF- « B-regulated gene .
Fibrinogen-related proteins are already believed to be important participants in leukocyte trafficking and tissue remodeling and now can also be implicated in the mechanisms whereby altered coagulation/fibri-nolysis homeostasis in inflamed tissue influences activation signaling of mononuclear phagocytes .
