Transgene expression did not affect the thymic development , but led to lowered numbers of splenic T cells and to a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of splenic T lymphocytes .
Analysis of IL-2 and IL-2Ra expression demonstrated that the perturbation of the proliferation response was not attributable to an abnormal expression of these genes .
In contrast , expression of IL-4 , IL-10 , and IFN-y was strongly inhibited in the transgenic T cells .
The proliferative deficiency of the transgenic T cells was associated with an increased apoptosis .
These results point out the involvement of NF-B/Rel family proteins in growth signaling pathways by either regulating proteins involved in the IL-2 signaling or by functionally interfering with the cell cycle progression .

It is thought to play a critical role in the transcription of numerous genes involved in the immune response and inflammation ( 4 ) .
NF- « B-responsive genes include genes coding for various regulatory cytokines , adhesion molecules , cell surface receptors , and immune modulators that are involved in T cell effector function ( 4 ) .
In thymocytes , NF- « B was described to be activated in vivo in both mice and humans ( 2 , 5 ) .
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses of human thymocytes and thymic sections revealed a higher density of prototypical NF- « B and c-Rel/p50 proteins in the medullary thymocytes , but the prototypical NF- « B was also detected in nuclei of some cortical thymocytes ( 6 ) .
In mice , constitutively activated NF- « B was found in thymocytes from both embryos and newborn pups , but not in adult thymocytes ( 7 , 8 ) .
These results suggested a role for NF-KB in the complex maturation process that takes place in the thymus .

It belongs to the NF- « B/Re !
family of dimeric transcription factors , which also includes c-Rel , RelB , and p52 ( processed product of p100 ) .
All members of the family share a highly conserved amino-terminal sequence called the Rel homology domain , which is critical for nuclear translocation , protein-protein interactions , and sequence-specific DNA binding ( 9 ) .
NF- « B complexes are localized typically to the cytoplasm , where they bind to inhibitory cytoplasmic proteins called IxBs ( 3 , 10 ) .
Several members of the IB regulatory family have been characterized , including IxBa , I « kBB , IxBy , IxBe , the two NF- « B protein precursors p105 and p100 , and Bel3 ( 11 ) .
In T cells , the major NE- « B dimer that is activated during T cell activation is RelA/p50 , but c-Rel/p50 is also present ( 4 ) .
Studies of IxBa-deficient mice demonstrated that the dominant IB regulator of NF- « B/Re !
in T cells is IxBa ( 12 ) , the product of the MAD3 gene ( 13 ) .
During normal T cell activation , IxBa is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome path-way , permitting the nuclear import of NF- « B ( 14 , 15 ) .
The molecular mechanism resulting in IxBa proteolysis is complex and not completely elucidated .
However , at least two post-translational covalent modifications have been reported to be essential for its degradation .
The first post-translational event resulting from T cell activation is phosphorylation of two serines at positions 32 and 36 by a recently identified group of IxBa kinases ( 16-19 ) .
This initial phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the second modification of IxBa , which is the ubiquitination of lysines 21 and 22 ( 20 ) .
The ubiquitination of IxBa results in its rapid degradation by the 268 proteasome ( 21 ) .
Substitution of the two serines 32 and 36 by alanine residues protects IxBa from ubiquitination and protea-some-mediated proteolysis ( 22 ) .
Consequently , if expressed in sufficient amounts , the double-mutated IxBa prevents NF- « B activation in transiently or stably transfected cells ( 22-24 ) .
Despite accumulating amounts of in vitro and in vivo data suggesting an important role for NF- « B/Rel in immunity and inflam-mation , the full role of this family of proteins in vivo remained unclear .
To better understand the function of these proteins , a series of gene knockout experiments was performed .
Mice lacking 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology p50 or c-Rel exhibited deficiencies of mature lymphocyte proliferation as well as increased susceptibility to certain pathogens , but T cell development remained normal ( 25 , 26 ) .
Preliminary reports suggested that mice lacking p52 have a similar phenotype ( 27 ) .
Mice lacking RelB develop diffuse T lymphocyte-dependent inflammatory infiltrates and granulocytosis , and present a defect of dendritic cell development in lymphoid organs rather than an intrinsic defect of the T cell lineage ( 28 , 29 ) .
Mice lacking RelA do not survive past the 15th day of gestation because of apoptosis of developing hepatocytes ( 30 ) .
Because of this , the development and functionality of T cells in the absence of RelA could not be examined directly .
However , transplantation of RelA knockout embryonic stem cells into SCID mice resulted in normal T and B cell development , suggesting that RelA is dispensable for differentiation and maturation of lymphocytes ( 31 ) .
However , the potential functional redundancy among NF- « B/Rel family members has to be considered , and this complicates the understanding of these gene disruption experiments ( 32 , 33 ) .
To circumvent the problem of functional redundancy of NF-KB members in the T cell lineage and to further characterize the roles of the NF- « B complexes in T cell development and T cell-depen-dent immune response , we ( the present paper ) and others ( 31 , 34 , 35 ) have generated transgenic mice in which RelA- and c-Rel-NF- « B were selectively inhibited in the T-lineage cells .
This was achieved by using a transgene representing a frans-dominant form of IxBa .
While Ballard et al .
used an N-terminal-deleted IxBa transgene , IxB ( AN ) , we used a mutated IxBa , termed IxBa ( 32/ 36A ) , in which the two serines at positions 32 and 36 were substituted by alanines .
The expression of the transgene was under lineage-specific control of the proximal Ick promoter ( 36 ) .
This mutated IxBa inhibitor repressed constitutively the nuclear import and DNA binding of RelA- and c-Rel-NF- « B complexes in stably transfected human cell lines as well as in transitory transfection experiments .
In mice , our results demonstrated that IxBa ( 32/36 ) constituted a powerful NF- « B inhibitor in thymocytes and to a lesser extent in peripheral T cells by inhibiting both RelA- and c-ReI-NF- « B activities .
Several biological consequences of the IxBa ( 32/36A ) transgene were similar to those observed with such as 1 ) a decreased number of splenic T cells , especially the CD8 * subpopulation ; 2 ) a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of T lymphocytes ; and 3 ) increased apoptosis of T cells .
In addition we show in this report the effect of IxBa ( 32/36A ) on ex vivo production of a series of cytokines .
While IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines were transcriptionally inhibited , the production of IL-2 and IL-2Ra remained normal in IkBa ( 32/ 36A ) mice .
Materials and Methods Generation of transgenic mice expressing IxBa ( 32/364 ) Generation of human IxBa cDNA , substituted by alanines at positions 32 and 36 ( IxBa ( 32/36A ) ) , was described by Traenckner et al .
( 22 ) and was a gift from P. Bacuerle ( Tularik , CA ) .
The IxBa ( 32/36A ) cDNA was cloned into the BamHI site of the p1017-Ick plasmid containing the murine Ick proximal promoter and the human growth hormone ( hGH ) minigene ( 37 ) .
Deletion of the termination codon from the I « Ba ( 32/36A ) cDNA resulted in a 3 ' end tag corresponding to 30 aa at the C-terminus of the resulting transgenic protein ( see Fig .
1A ) .
In vitro transcription and translation of the tagged transgene ( TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system , Promega ) produced proteins presenting apparent m.w .
of 58,000 and 45,000 in SDS-PAGE ( data not shown ) .
A 6.2-kb NofI fragment containing the Ick promoter , the tagged IxBa ( 32/36 ) cDNA , and hGH minigene from the plasmide p1017-IxBa ( 32/36 ) was prepared by gel purification .
The concentration of the purified linear DNA was adjusted ° Abbreviations used in this paper : hGH , human growth hormone ; Luc , luciferase ; CDK , cyclin-dependent kinase .
6443 to 3 ug/ml in injection buffer ( 0.25 mM EDTA and 5 mM Tris-HCI , pH 7.4 ) before microinjection .
All techniques used in the generation of transgenic mice were performed essentially as described previously ( 38 ) .
Briefly , transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear microinjection of 0.5 days postcoitus embryos obtained from 6-wk-old superovulated C57B16XCBAF1 females mated with males of the same genotype .
Injected eggs were implanted into pseudopregnant CD1 females .
Three transgenic founder animals ( 5 , 3 , and 23 ) were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blotting on genomic DNA obtained from small tail biopsies .
All animals were obtained from Charles River Italy ( Milan , Italy ) and were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions .
The restriction of IxBa ( 32/ 36A ) transgene expression to the T cell lineage was confirmed by Western blotting using protein extracts from spleen , liver , brain , thymus , and purified T and B lymphocytes .
T cell preparation Cells from thymus and spleen were prepared by crushing the organs in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 , 10 % FCS , and standard concentrations of glutamine and antibiotics ) .
After hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes , the splenic T cells were depleted of B cells by chromatography through nylon wool columns ( 39 ) , followed by adsorption on pan-B Abs coupled to magnetic beads ( B220 , Dynal , Compiégne , France ) .
The resulting population was systematically 95 % T cells and 1 % B cells as determined by flow cytometric analysis .
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation Cytoplasmic extracts from thymocytes and splenocytes were prepared by hypotonic disruption of cells ( 5 mM HEPES , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KCI , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.1 mM PMSF , and 0.1 mM aprotinin ) .
Proteins were resolved by 10 % SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted on nylon membranes , and IxBa proteins were visualized using an mAb ( MAD1IOB ) specific for an N-terminal domain of I « Ba ( 40 ) , the HRP-coupled anti-mouse Ab , and the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence visualization system kit ( Arling-ton Heights , IL ) .
EMSAs Nuclear proteins from either resting or 1-h PMA- plus ionomycin-treated thymocytes or purified splenic T cells were prepared as described previously ( 41 ) .
The DNA-protein reaction was performed as previously described ( 41 ) using 10 ug of nuclear protein extracts and °°P 5 ' end-labeled oligonucleotide coding for the tandem B sequence from the HIV-long terminal repeat enhancer .
The resulting protein-oligonucleotide complexes were resolved by 6 % PAGE and visualized by autoradiography .
Cell proliferation assays Purified splenic T cells ( 250,000 cells/well ) were cultured in 96-well plates in triplicate with 250 ng/ml ionomycin plus 10 ng/ml PMA or with coated anti-CD3e 145 2C11 Ab ( 0.5 ug/well ) ( 42 ) alone or in the presence of anti-CD28 PV-I ( 6Ga ) Ab ( 0.5 pug/well ; provided by Dr. Carl June , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD ) for 48 or 72 h. Tritiated thymidine , ( 1 wCi ) from ICN ( Costa Mesa , CA ) was added to the culture for an additional 12 h. Cultured cells were then harvested ( Scatron , Tranby , Nor-way ) , and incorporated [ H ] thymidine was analyzed by scintillation count-ing .
Quantitation of cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR RNAs were prepared from purified splenic T cells before and after stimulation by ionomycin plus PMA or by coated 145 2C11 anti-CD3e Ab .
Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate method with minor modifications ( 43 ) .
T cells were examined for IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-10 , IFN-y , TNF- « , and B-actin transcripts by a semiquantitative reverse transcribed PCR .
Commercial primer sets were provided by Stratagene ( La Jolla , CA ) .
Quantitation of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y by ELISA and CTLL-2 proliferation Production of IL-2 by purified splenic T cells in response to mitogens was estimated using an IL-2-dependent T cell line , CTLL-2 ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) .
Purified splenic T cells were activated with mitogens ( 10 ng/ml PMA plus 250 ng/ml ionomycin or coated 145 2C11 anti-CD3 Ab alone ( 5 ug in 500 1 ) or in association with CD28-specific PV-1 ( 6Ga ) Ab ( 5 ug in 500 gl ) ) for 24-48 h. Supernatants from the T cells ( 10° cells/ml ) were harvested and tested for IL-2 by CTLL-2 proliferation as previously described ( 44 ) .
Production of IL-4 and IFN-y was measured by ELISA using plates precoated with anti-mouse IL-4 and IFN-y Abs according to the protocol described previously ( 44 ) .

All tests were performed in triplicate .
Production of IL-4 by ELA cell clones was also monitored by ELISA .
Stable transfections of EL4 cells The parental Th2 murine cell line , EL4 ( American Type Culture Collec-tion ) , was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing glutamine , antibiot-ics , 2-ME , and 10 % FCS .
Expression vector pCMV-I « Ba ( 32/36A ) was made by inserting MAD3 cDNA mutant ( positions 32 and 36 ) into the XbaUV/HindIII sites of the pcDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
Expression vector pCMV-IxBa ( 32/36A ) tag was made by inserting the IxBa ( 32/36A ) -tagged murine transgene into the HindIII site of the peDNA3 vector .
EL4 cells were transfected with pCMV-IxBa ( 32/36 ) , pCMV-IxBa ( 32/36 ) tag , or the empty pcDNA3 vector by electropora-tion .
G418-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution and were geno-typed by Western blot using the mAb MAD 10B or by PCR using MAD3-and hGH-specific primers .
The clones with stable integration of the IxBa ( 32/36 ) transgene were grown in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 .
Luciferase ( Luc ) assays The following vectors were used for « B-dependent Luc assays .
The 4p110-Luc and 4p575-Luc constructs ( 45 ) , which contain 110 and 575 bp of the murine IL-4 promoter , were provided by Prof. W. Paul ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) .
Transient transfections of the EL4 cell clones with Luc vectors were performed by electroporation ( Bio-Rad Gene Pulser , Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) with 10 ug of plasmid DNA/S X 10° cells .
Two hours after transfection , cells were split into two pools .
One pool of cells was incubated in medium alone , and the other pool was incubated with 10 ng/ml PMA plus 250 ng/ml ionomycin for 24 h. Luc assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system ( Madison , WI ) .
Light emission was measured in a luminometer ( Bio-Rad ) .
The results were calculated as relative light units ( light emission/background/milligrams of protein ) .
Transfections experiments were repeated at least three times .
Results Expression and functionality of IxBa ( 32/36A ) transgene We have generated transgenic mice that integrated a tagged mutated form of IxBa under the control of the T cell lineage-specific Ick proximal promoter and the hGH minigene ( Fig .
14 ) .
To check the expression of the transgene in T cells , we performed Western blot experiments using cytosolic protein extracts from thymocytes of three founder mice lines , Tg 3 , Tg 23 , and Tg 5 ( Fig .
1B ) .
The amounts of expressed transgenic IxBa in these animals correlated with integration copy number as determined by Southern blotting ( data not shown ) .
The mice from the Tg 5 line expressed the highest level of the transgenic IxBa protein ( Fig .
1B , lane 5 ) , whereas the Tg 3 mice produced the lowest amount of the transgene ( lane 2 ) .
The major form of the transgene migrated as a 58-kDa protein .
The minor form of the transgene appeared as a 45-kDa protein and was detectable mostly in the Tg 5 line .
Both the 58- and 45-kDa forms were obtained by in vitro transcription/translation assay ( not shown ) , indicating that they do not result from a recombination or splicing of the transgene in vivo .
Specific Abs raised against the 30-aa tag also recognized both 58- and 45-kDa forms ( not shown ) .
Finally , immunoprecipitation of thymocyte protein extracts with an Ab specific for the carboxyl-terminal portion of the followed by Western blotting using an mAb specific for the amino-terminal region of IxBa revealed that both 58- and 45-kDa forms are composed of IxBa ( not shown ) .
These results suggest that the tagged mutated IxBa cDNA was expressed as a protein presenting two conformations .
The preferential conformation in denaturing conditions had a m.w .
of 58,000 , but a minor form of 45,000 was also detected .
Consistent with the in vitro IxBa gene regulation studies ( 24 , 46 , 47 ) , we observed that in the most highly expressing transgenic thymocytes ( Tg 5 ) the level of the endogenous form of IxBa was reduced compared with that in the control mice thymocytes ( Fig .
1B , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Since the Ick promoter was initially described as being mostly active in thymocytes , we sought expression of the transgenic IxBa in peripheral T cells purified from spleens .
Western blotting of the cytosolic extracts from purified T and B cell splenic populations clearly indicated that the transgene was also produced in splenic cells , but exclusively in the T cell lineage ( Fig .
1C ) .
Consistent with the in vivo transgenesis studies using Ick proximal promoter ( 37 ) , we observed that the transgene is less expressed in T cells than in thymocytes .
This decrease in ( 32/36 ) protein in T cells was correlated with an increment in endogenous IxBa expression ( Fig .
1C , lanes I and 2 ) .
In addition , comparison between purified CD4* and CD8 * T cells revealed that both populations expressed comparable levels of the transgenic IxBa ( not shown ) .
To verify the functionality of the transgene , we estimated the nuclear translocation capacity of the RelA- and c-Rel-NF- « B complexes in response to mitogenic activation by EMSA .
A 1-h treatment with PMA plus ionomycin of isolated thymocytes from control and transgenic mice revealed that NF- « B activation was inhibited in the three transgenic lines ( Fig .
1D ) .
The efficiency of NF- « B inhibition was dose dependent on the IxBa ( 32/36 ) expression , since in the low transgene producer ( Tg 3 ) NF- « B activity was only reduced , whereas in the two other lines ( 5 and 23 ) , which produce higher amounts of the transgene , no mitogen-induced NF- « B activity was detected .
In splenic T lymphocytes , we observed that the inhibition of NF- « B translocation was less potent compared with that in corresponding thymocytes ( not shown ) .
This result correlated with the amount of expression of the IxBa transgene ( Fig .
1C ) and indicated that in peripheral T lymphocytes , the amount of the transgenic IxkBa was not sufficient for complete NF- « B inhibition .
Supershift experiments identified the residual NF- « B activity as being RelA-p50 dimer ( not shown ) .
This approach did not find c-Rel in splenic T cells from control and IxBa ( 32/36A ) mice .
Thus , we can not exclude that small amounts of c-Rel activity remain in the transgenic T cells .
The inhibition of NF-KB activity was due to a direct interaction of the 58-kDa transgene with NF-KB proteins , as revealed by immunoprecipitation assays of proteins extracted from transgenic thymocytes with RelA- and c-Rel-specific Abs ( not shown ) .
Together , these results demonstrated that the transgenic IkBa , in its major 58-kDa conformation , efficiently inhibited NF- « B activation in thymocytes by interacting with both RelA and c-Rel NF- « B complexes and induced a partial inhibition of NF- « B in peripheral T cells .
Biological effects of the IxBa ( 32/364 ) transgene IxBa ( 32/36A ) transgenic mice lived and reproduced normally in the pathogen-free conditions .
The thymic cellularities in adult animals were normal .
The CD4/CD # 8-positive cell ratio and TCR , CD62L , CD45RB , and CD44 expressions appeared normal , confirming the results reported for IxBa ( AN ) ( data not shown ) ( 34 ) .
These results indicated that despite efficient NF- « B inhibition , T cell intrathymic proliferation and differentiation occurred normally in IxBa ( 32/36 ) transgenic animals , similarly to that in IxBa ( AN ) transgenic animals , and contradicted our initial previsions .
In contrast , analysis of splenocyte subsets confirmed an alteration of the B/T cell ratio ( increased in the Tg animals ) and of the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio ( the numbers of CD8 * T lymphocytes were reduced relative to those of CD4 cells ) similar to that in IxkBa ( AN ) mice ( not shown ) ( 34 ) .
This was not due to a differential expression of the transgene in the CD4 * and CD8 * popula-tions , since Western blot analysis indicated that the transgene was produced with comparable efficiencies in both T cell populations .

A 48-h treatment of T cells with PMA plus ionomycin evidenced a strong decrease in the proliferative response in both line 3 and line 5 animals compared with that in their respective control littermates ( not shown ) .
The proliferative failure of splenic T cells was noticeably stronger in the 5 line .
At 72 h of cell culture , the prolif- erative defect was even stronger in the 5 line , whereas it was decreased in the 3 line , suggesting that the amount of residual NF- « B activity detected in the Tg 3 line in EMSA experiments was sufficient to rescue the proliferation failure .
In contrast , thymocytes from the transgenic and control animals proliferated in a comparable manner ( not shown ) .
To check whether addition of IL-2 or of stimulants that result in stabilization of IL-2 could rescue the proliferative response in the 5 line T cells , we performed cell activation with immobilized CD3-specific Abs in the presence or the absence of exogenous IL-2 or with a combination of immobilized 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6446 T CELL ACTIVATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN IxBa TRANSGENIC MICE 48h 72h \ \ 50 4 F 40 { 30 - 4 20 4 g NTg 10 4 “ Vim .

Clearly , neither CD28 costimulus nor exogenous IL-2 was able to rescue the proliferative response of splenic T cells from the Tg 5 mice , indicating that the lack of proliferation was not due to the lack of IL-2 production .
This result confirmed the findings of Boothby et al .
( 34 ) .
Addition of other mitogenic cytokines , such as IL-7 and IL-4 , also did not rescue the proliferative response ( not shown ) .
IxBa ( 32/36A ) transgenic T cells produce normal amounts of IL-2 and IL-2Ra IL-2 acts as the principal auto- and paracrine T cell growth factor .
In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested a central role for NF- « B/Rel proteins in the regulation of both IL-2 and the inducible IL-2Ra ( 24 , 48-50 ) .
IL-2 and IL-2Ra are normally produced by T lymphocytes in response to activation signals such as TCR triggering or phorbol ester treatment in association with calcium influx inducers .
In IxBa ( AN ) mice IL-2 production was reduced consequent to NF-KB inhibition ( 34 ) .
To measure the capacity of the mitogen-activated line 5 and control T splenocytes to secrete IL-2 we collected their supernatants and tested their capacity to activate proliferation of the CTLL-2 cell line that proliferates in a dose-response manner to IL-2 .
As shown in Fig .
3 , no significant differences in IL-2 production were observed between transgenic and nontransgenic T cells , indicating that IL-2 was secreted normally by IxBa ( 32/36 ) transgenic mice .
This result further indicated that the proliferative failure of the transgenic T cells was not due to the lack of IL-2 secretion and confirmed the results of Doi et al .
( 31 ) , who showed that RelA-/- T cells produce IL-2 , but present a reduced mitogenic response .
The a subunit of the IL-2R ( CD25 ) is another potential target for NF- « B ( 48 ) .
To investigate whether the proliferative defect was due to the inhibition of CD25 expression , we measured the 1000 900 7 800 7 700 7 600 7 500 4 IL-2 ( ng/ml ) 400 { 300 7 200 { 100 4 NTg Tg5 NTg Tg5 CD3 CD3+CD28 FIGURE 3 .

IL-2 production by splenic T cells from control mice ( NTg ; dashed bars ) and transgenic mice ( Tg5 ; black bars ) was measured by a CTLL-2 proliferation assay .
T cells were cultured in triplicate for 48 h in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 Abs alone or in combination with anti-CD28 Abs ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Supernatants from these cell cultures were assayed for IL-2 by CTLL-2 proliferation and were quantitated by comparison to CTLL-2 proliferation in medium containing known doses of IL-2 protein .

expression of CD25 by flow cytometry .
When treated with PMA plus ionomycin ( conditions under which proliferation of Tg 5 T cells was inhibited by > 90 % compared with that in control cells ) , CD25 was induced in the same manner in both transgenic and control T cells ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , inhibition of the proliferation of Tg T cells is not explainable by the absence of IL-2 or its receptor .
IxBa ( 32/36A ) Tg T cells fail to produce IL-4 , IL-10 , and IFN-y To investigate the effect of NF- « B inhibition on the induction of other cytokines , we measured the secretion of IFN-y , which was shown to contain an intronic binding site for c-Rel ( 51 ) and the secretion of which by the Th1 subset of T cells parallels that of IL-2 .
A typical result obtained by ELISA demonstrated that IFN-y production by Tg T cells was 10 times less than that by controls ( Fig .
44 ) .
This result was further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis ( Fig .
4C ) .
The RT-PCR measurement further confirmed that IL-2 induction was normal in Tg mice ( Fig .
4C ) .
Measurement of TNF-a production by RT-PCR show no significant difference in mRNA levels between Tg and control mice , although this gene was previously described as possessing « B sites in its promoter domains ( 52 ) .
Curiously , IL-4 and IL-10 production was inhibited as shown by RT-PCR and ELISA of IL-4 ( Fig .
4 , B and C ) .
To determine whether the absence of IL-4 production was due to a down-regulation of the Th2 cell population or to a direct effect on IL-4 promoter , we analyzed IL-4 production and IL-4 promoter activation in EL4 cells ( a murine Th2-type cell line ) .
Stable transfection of ELA cells with ( 32/36 ) vectors ( tagged and untagged ) resulted in the inhibition of IL-4 secretion ( Fig .
5A ) .
Transcription of the luciferase reporter gene driven by two murine IL-4 promoter constructs was also significantly inhibited in IxBa ( 32/36 ) clones compared with that in the control clone , especially the construct containing sequences upstream from the P1 domain ( Fig .
5B ) .
These results suggest that NF- « B is required for efficient transcription of the IL-4 gene .

The RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for various genes , as indicated at the leff .
The B-actin gene constituted the internal control .
suggest that the lack of IL-4 production by these mice is due to a deficient activation of the IL-4 gene rather than to an underdevel-opment of the Th2 subpopulation .
Enhanced apoptosis of IxBa ( 32/36A ) Tg T cells NF- « B/Re !
proteins have been implicated in inhibition ( 53 ) and stimulation ( 53-55 ) of cell susceptibility to apoptosis .
For example , RelA-deficient mice die from apoptosis of embryonic hepatocytes ( 30 ) .
We investigated whether the splenic T cell lymphopenia and the lack of proliferative response in ex vivo experiments might be due to an enhanced apoptotic susceptibility of the IxBa ( 32/36 ) transgenic T cells .
Cell death was measured by the use of the TUNEL assay ( 56 ) .
Compared with controls , we observed a 40 % increase in the spontaneous apoptosis of line 5 T cells , and a 3 times higher apoptosis after 48 h of PMA plus ionomycin treatment ( not shown ) .
Thus , the inhibition of NF-KB in the T cells led to an increased apoptosis in both activation and resting conditions and might explain in part the strong inhibition of the proliferative response of Tg T cells as well as the hypoplasticity of splenic T cells in vivo .

Discussion In an attempt to elucidate the functions of NF- « B/Re !
factors in the T cell lineage , we have developed a transgenic mouse model in which a dominant-negative mutated form of IxBa was overex-pressed in thymocytes and in T cells from secondary lymphoid tissues .
This T cell-targeted inhibition of NF-KB has clear advantages and inconveniences over gene disruption experiments , since it allowed inhibition of two NF- « B complexes ( c-Rel- and RelA-p50 ) without inducing lethality .
On the other hand , we found that , at least in mice over the age of 6 wk , the transgenic IxBa was incompletely inhibiting NF- « B activities in the peripheral T cells .
The efficiency of the transgenic IxBa was related to its expression level , and consequently , it was less potent in peripheral T cells than in thymocytes .
Despite these differences in NF-KB inhibition , the biological effects of the transgene were detectable only in mature T cells .
Indeed , our observations basically confirmed those of Boothby et al .
( 34 ) and Doi et al .
( 31 ) that thymocyte cellularities and intrathymic differentiation are little , if at all , affected by inhi- bition of NF-KB within T cells .
In contrast to these results , Es-slinger et al .
reported a significant reduction in thymocyte cellu-larity as well as a spectacular deficiency of the mature single-positive thymocytes in mice transgenic for human IxBa ( 35 ) .
Further investigations are necessary to explain these differences in thymus phenotypes .
Despite only a partial NF-KB inhibition in splenic T cells , mature T cell subsets were further compromised .
In situ splenic T cell lymphopenia and alteration of the CD4/CD8 ratio were observed , similar to the findings of Boothby et al .
In animals transgenic for IBB , a strong T cell lymphopenia was also obtained ( 57 ) .
Together , these results indicate that normal NF-KB activation is required for T cell homeostasis .
Ex vivo proliferation studies showed that IxBa ( 32/36 ) transgenic T cells failed to proliferate in response to mitogenic stimuli , and that in contrast to T cells from c-Rel-deficient mice , addition of IL-2 to incubation medium did not restore proliferation despite normal expression of CD25 ( 25 ) .
Similar results were previously reported for T cells ( 34 ) , except that the IxBa { ( AN ) T cells failed to produce IL-2 , while IxkBa ( 32/36 ) T cells produced normal amounts of this growth factor .
This difference could be due to the fact that in I « xBa ( 32/36 ) T lymphocytes , NF-KB activation was only partially inhibited .
In every case , these results indicated that the defect in T cell proliferation and homeostasis is not attributable to a deficiency of IL-2 or its inducible receptor , but , rather , to a defect in IL-2 signal transduction .
Thus , NF- « B is involved in the control of molecular events downstream of IL-2R , but the mechanism and the potential gene targets of NF- « B that are involved in IL-2 growth signaling remain to be identified .
Our results also confirmed that NF-KB is critical for apoptotic protection of T cells ( 34 ) .
Fas ligand and antiapoptotic gene products such as Bel-2 and Bel-x have been reported to participate in the regulation of T cell apoptosis and should be examined ( 58-63 ) .
IL-2 and CD25 are produced in T cells during the early stage of the G , phase of the cell cycle ( 64 ) .
Since the transgenic T cells produced IL-2 and CD25 normally , our observations indicated that partial inhibition of NF- « B activities did not block the initial G , -G , transition .
However , [ °HJthymidine incorporation was strongly inhibited ( as was bromodeoxyuridine incorporation , not shown ) , indicating that full NF-KB activation is required for T cell cycle G , /S progression .
Although little is known about NF-KB involvement in cell cycle regulation , several reports demonstrated that NF-KB activity can be regulated by factors involved in the cell cycle progression .
For example , the interaction of NF-kB and CDKs through the p300 and CREB-binding protein coactivators provides a mechanism for the coordination of transcriptional activation with cell cycle progression ( 65 , 66 ) .
NF-KB could also be involved in the activity or transcription of proteins controlling directly the G , /S transition .
Indeed , Bash et al .
reported that c-Rel expression leads to cell cycle arrest in G , by changing the activation and/or expression of E2F , Cdk2 , p53 , and p21 '' ~* ' '' proteins in HeLa cells ( 67 ) .
IL-2-induced T cell proliferation was shown to be mediated by down-regulation of the cyclin-CDK inhibitor p27 ( 68 ) .
Thus , one might speculate that NF-B is involved in the G , /S phase transition in T cells by either transcriptionally controlling or functionally interacting with the cell cycle molecular machinery .
Although normal production of IL-2 by I « Ba ( 32/36 ) cells indicated that the low amounts of NFE- « B activity in these cells were sufficient to induce some of the NF-KB gene targets , the important biological consequences of partial NF- « B inhibition ( lack of proliferation , apoptosis ) indicated that several genes were down-regulated .
Among those genes , Th1 subset cytokines such as IFN-y , and Th2 subset cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 were 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology transcriptionally inhibited .
The down-regulation of IL-4 by inhibition of NF-B activity was mimicked in vitro by stable transfection of EL-4 cells by IxBa ( 32/36 ) , indicating that the reduction of Th2 cytokine expression resulted from a direct effect on the transcription of this gene and not on a lack of the Th2 cell subtype .
IL-4 down-regulation was surprising , since the murine IL-4 promoter is not known to possess high affinity « B sites .
The human IL-4 promoter was reported to be repressed by RelA-p50 through the P1 sequence , but this did not seem to be the case for the murine promoter ( 69 ) .
These results indicated that murine and human IL-4 genes are not regulated identically by NF- « B factors .
Our results obtained both in vitro ( ELA cells ) and in vivo indicated that even partial inhibition of NF-KB activities in peripheral T cells leads to down-regulation of the murine IL-4 gene , suggesting that NF-KB is required for positive regulation of the IL-4 gene in mice .
Fur-thermore , an increased NF-KB activity obtained in NF- « B2 '~ mice led to increased IL-4 and IL-10 production ( 70 ) .
Further studies are necessary to explain the mechanism of IL-4 gene regulation by NF-KB .
IL-10 possesses several « B sites far upstream of its transcriptional start , but its transcriptional regulation by NF- « B has never been reported ( 71 ) .
A previous study of TNE- @ gene regulation demonstrated that multimers of TNF-a « B sites could confer inducibility on a heterologous promoter in a B , but not in a T , cell line ( 72 ) .
Our data further demonstrated that NF-B is not required for TNF- « induction in T lymphocytes .
Finally , another gene known to be critically dependent on NF- « B activation , namely IxBa , was down-regulated in IxBa ( 32/36A ) T cells , at least in the mice line producing the highest amounts of the transgene .
Besides IL-2 , other genes known to possess « B sites in their promoter region were not down-regulated in IxBa ( 32/36 ) T cells .
Thus , the attenuated nuclear import of RelA and c-Rel dimers in splenic T cells seems to differentially affect transcription of different target genes .
These results highlight our ignorance of the real mechanism of in vivo regulation of transcription through particular B sites in individual genes and suggest that many genes with « B sites could be either NF- « B independent or dose dependent .
In addition , many genes could be indirectly regulated by the NF- « B/Re !
family by transcriptional control of other genes specific for transcription factors .
Although many other biological consequences of NF- « B inhibition in T cells remain to be investigated , the results presented here demonstrated the critical role of NF-KB transcription factors in normal T cell proliferation , homeostasis , and production of cytokines .
