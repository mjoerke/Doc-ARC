Involvement of Egr-1/ RelA Synergy in Distinguishing T Cell Activation from Tumor Necrosis Factor- « -induced NF- « kBI Transcription By Patricia C. Cogswell , * Marty W. Mayo , * and Albert S. Baldwin , Jr.* # From the * Lineberger Comprehensive C ancer C enter ; and *Department of Biology , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , N orth Carolina 27599-7295 Sum m ary NF-KB is an important transcription factor required for T cell proliferation and other immuno-logical functions .
The gene encodes a 105-kD protein that is the precursor of the p50 component of NF-kB .
Previously , we and others have demonstrated that NF-KB regulates the gene .
In this manuscript we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which T cell lines stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and phytohemagglutin ( PHA ) display significantly higher levels of NF-BI encoding transcripts than cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-a , despite the fact that both stimuli activate NF-KB .
Characterization of the NF- « kBI1 promoter identified an Egr-1 site which was found to be essential for both the PMA/ PH A-mediated induction as well as the synergistic activation observed after the expression of the RelA subunit of NF-KB and Egr-1 .
Furthermore , Egr-1 induction was required for endogenous NF-kBI gene expression , since PMA/ PHA-stimulated T cell lines expressing antisense Egr-1 RNA were inhibited in their ability to upregulate NF-B1 transcription .
O ur studies indicate that transcriptional synergy mediated by activation of both Egr-1 and NF-kB may have important ramifications in T cell development by upregulating NF-BI gene expression .
cell activation results in a rapid activation of NF-KB ( 1 , 2 ) which appears to play an important role in T cell proliferation , partly because of the involvement of this transcription factor in the upregulation of the IL-2 and cognate receptor ( IL-2R ) genes ( 3 ) .
NF-KB was originally described to be composed of heterodimeric subunits of p50 and p65 proteins ( 1 , 2 ) and is typically found in the cytoplasm of cells as an inactive precursor complex with an inhibitor protein , IB ( 4 ) .
The NF-kBI gene product p105 is processed into the DNA-binding subunit of p50 through a mechanism that requires serine phosphorylation ( 5 ) and the induction of an ATP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( 6 , 7 ) .
Cellular activation leads to an increase in transcripts , p105 processing , and subsequent p50 accumulation in both fibroblasts and in T cells ( 5 , 8 ) .
Although little is known about the regulation of NF-kBI in T lymphocytes , its expression has been demonstrated to be essential for proliferation after costimulation through CD2 or CD28 receptors ( 9 ) .
R ecently , it has been demonstrated that lymphocytes derived from p50 cient mice display defects in immune responses ( 10 ) .
In addition Sha et al .
( 10 ) noted that T cells derived from these animals were unable to effectively proliferate in response to TCR and CD28 costimulation .
Although disruption of the NF-kBI gene did not result in lethality , possibly because P.C .
Cogswell and M.W .
Mayo contributed equally to the scientific merit and preparation of this manuscript .
p52 could substitute for p50 , these studies strongly suggest that the p50 DNA-binding component of NF-KB is critical for T cell proliferation .
Analysis of the promoter revealed several NF-KB DNA-binding sites within the upstream regulatory region which are capable of binding p50 homodimers , p50/ p65 , or p50/c-Rel heterodimers and , in part , account for the ability of NF-KB to regulate gene expression ( 11 , 12 ) .
Although the NF- « kBI promoter has been shown to require NF-KB for activity , it is presently unclear whether NF-KB needs other transcription factors to mediate a transcriptional response .
This is especially important because on many responsive promoters NF-kB alone is insufficient at activating transcription ( 2 ) .
T cell stimulation mediated by the addition of either PMA and PHA or TNF-a results in an increase in NF-KBI expression ( 13 ) .
Both stimuli activate NF-KB nuclear translocation and DNA-binding within 15 to 30 min ( 14 ) ; however , phorbol esters in combination with mitogens result in a greater accumulation of NF-kB ] transcripts ( 11 , 13 ) .
Our research demonstrates that full PMA/ PHA-mediated activation of the NF-kBI promoter not only required the NF-KB transcription factor , but also the activation of the early growth response gene product ( Egr-1 ) ' .

Our data establishes Egr-1 and RelA as important transcription factors capable of synergistically transactivating the NF-KBI promoter .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture and T ransient T rinsfection Analysis .
- CEM cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS and antibi-otics .
Cells were stimulated by supplementing their growth medium with either PMA and PHA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml and 5 jwg/ ml , respec-tively , or TNF-a ( 10 ng/ ml ; Promega Corp. , Madison , WJ ) .
Transient transfections by electroporation ( 11 ) and luciferase or chloram-phenicol acetyl-transferase assays were performed as previously described ( 11 , 18 , 19 ) .
Plasmid Construds and Site-dired¢ed Mutagenesis .
Both the NF-B1 promoter constructs , p50HS- and p50SS-CAT , were previously described ( 11 ) .
The SpS- , HiS- , and AS-CAT constructs were generated by digesting the p50HS-CAT reporter with HindIII , and SphI , Hinfl , or Apol , respectively .
The SSLUC reporter plasmid was generated by cloning the Stul/ Smal fragment from p50HS-CAT into the pGL2 basic reporter containing the luciferase gene ( Promega Corp. ) .
The Stul/ Smal fragment of the NF- « BI promoter was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using a two-staged PCR ( 20 ) .
The mNLUC construct , containing the disrupted 289-bp NF-kB site , was made using a 5 ' primer ( 5-ATGTAACTGAGACAC-GCTTAAATGGAATA-3 ' ) and a 3 ' primer ( 5-AGGCCAT-CAGCGCCGCGCCATGGCCGCA-3 '' ) in the first round of amplification and two internal primers ( 5-AGGCGCTTCCT-GGAAGCTTGAATACCGGCTCCAG-3 ' and 5-CTGGAG-CCGGTATTCAAGCTTCCAGGAAGCGCCT-3 ' ) which mutated the kB element to a HindIII site .
The NF- « kBI promoter sequences containing a site-directed mutation within the Egr-1 DNA binding site ( mELUC ) was created using the same 5 ' and 3 '' primers described above plus two internal primers GCAGCGAATTCGGGAGGTAGGGTC-3 ' ) and ( 5-GACCCT-ACCTCCCGAATTCGCTGCGTGCGC-3 ' ) which destroyed both the SP1/Egr-1 motif and created a unique EcoRI site .
The mNELUC construct was created by mixing the mutant Egr-1 oligos described above and using the mNF-B fragment as a tem-plate .
The PCR amplified promoter fragments were cloned into the SSLUC construct by replacing the wild-type Pvull/ Smal fragment with the corresponding site-directed mutant promoter sequences .
Nucleotide sequences of mN , mE , and mNELUC constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis .
Northem Blot and Elearophoresis Mobility Shift Analysis .
- Total cellular RNA was isolated from CEM cells using the RNeasy total RNA kit ( Qiagen , Inc. , Chatsworth , CA ) .
Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described ( 11 ) .
Nuclear extracts were isolated and electrophoresis mobility shift analyses ( EMSAs ) were performed as previously described ( 11 , 18 ) .
Oligonucleotides corresponding to the NF- « BI promoter Egr-1 DNA binding site ( 5'-TCGACTCCCGCCCCCGCTGCG-3 ' and 5-TCGACGC-AGCGGGGGCGGGAG-3 ' ) were radiolabeled using « - [ P ] dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I .
For antibody super shift assays and competition experiments , nuclear extracts were preincubated ( 10 min , room temperature ) with either 1 ug of antiserum or with a nonradioactive double stranded oligonucle- otide before the addition of the radiolabeled gel shift probe .
The mutant Egr-1 probe ( annealed 5-TCGACTCCCGAATTCG-CTGCG-3 ' and 5-TCGACGCAGCGAATTCGGGAG-3 ' ) was used in competition assays .
The Egr-1-specific antibody ( SC No .
189 ) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Generation of Stable Cell Lines .
The full-length human Egr-1 cDNA was cloned into the EcoR 1 site of the CMV-5 expression vector in the antisense orientation .
CEM cells were cotransfected with either CMV-AsEgr- 1 or with the CMV-5 control vector in the presence of peDNA-3.1 Neo ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
Trans fected cells were grown in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1.5 mg/ ml of Geneticin ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithers burg , MD ) and resistant clones were isolated .
R Nase protection assays were performed using the RPA II kit ( Ambion , Inc. , Aus-tin , TX ) to ensure that the CEM/ AsEgr-1 cells were expressing the CMV-driven antisense human Ege / transcript .
Results and Discussion Differential Expression of NF-kB mRNA After PMA/ PHA- or TN F-o-Stimulation .
_ To determine whether differential expression of NF-kBI mRNA was observed after stimulation by PMA and PHA or TNF-a , Northern blot analysis was performed on total cellular RN A isolated from the human T cell line , CEM .
As shown in Fig .
1 A , NF-BI mRNA began to accumulate within 1 h of stimulation with PMA and PHA , and by 4 h a significant induction ( 10-fold ) was observed in CEM cells Although TNF-a-stim-ulated cells also displayed increases in NF-KkBI transcripts with similar kinetics , a substantially lower accumulation of mR NA was observed over the 4-h time course .
Identification of the NF- « kBI Promoter Region Required for PMA/ PHA -R esponsive Upregulation .
- To determine whether the increase in NF-kBI mRNA , seen in Fig .
1 A , was due to transcriptional upregulation of the promoter and not due to PMA/PHA-induced message stabilization , CEM cells were transiently transfected with the p50HS-CAT NF-kBI promoter construct and stimulated with either PMA/ PHA or TNF-a for 24 h. As shown in Fig .
1 B , the NF-kB !
promoter ( p50HS-CAT ) was strongly activated in CEM cells after PMA/PHA stimulation , but only weakly after TNF-a addition , suggesting that PMA/ PH A-mediated activation of the NF-kBI promoter was through a transcrip-tion-dependent mechanism .
To localize the PMA/ PH A-responsive region within the NF- « kBI1 promoter , a series of deletion promoter constructs were made .
CEM cells were transiently transfected with each reporter construct and then either stimulated with PMA/ PHA or with TNF-a .
As shown in Fig .
1 B , no significant difference in stimulation was observed between the HS- , the SS- , or the SpS-CAT constructs .
However , the HiS-CAT reporter , which lacked the -289 NF-KB site , displayed a significant decrease in promoter activity after stimulation by either PMA/PHA or TNF- « .
The AS-C AT reporter , lacking both the -103 and -11 kB sites , was greatly diminished in response to PMA/PHA- and TNF-o-mediated activation ( Fig .
1 B ) .
Collectively , this data indicates that the region between the SphI site ( -425 ) 492 _ Egr-1 and NF-KB Control T Cell-activated NF-BI Transcription A .

- Identification of an Egr-1 DNA binding site within the NF B1 promoter .
( A ) Nuclear extracts were isolated from CEM cells after a 2 h PMA/ PHA stimulation in either the absence or presence of cycloheximide ( 50 pg/ ml , 30 min pretreatment ) .
Nuclear extracts ( 5 pg ) were incubated with a P-labeled probe corresponding to the 68-bp Egr-1 site .
Competition assays and antibody supershift experiments were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts ( 15 min ) with either unlabeled mutant Egr-1 ( mEgr-1 ) or wild-type Egr-1 oligonucleotide ( 50 ng total ) before the addition of probe .

The NF- « BI Promoter Contains an Egr-1 Consensus Site and T Cells Stimulated with PMA and PHA , but not TNF-a , Display Egr-1 DNA Binding _- Computer analysis of the SphI/ Apo fragment of the NF- « kBI promoter identified potential DNA-binding motifs for five different transcription factors including AP-1 , E2F , Egr-1 , NF-KB , and SP1 .
Of these , NF-kB , Egr-1 , and AP-1 are known to display increased transactivation potential after PMA stimulation ( 2 , 15 , 21 ) .
Since PMA/ PHA and TNF-a both activated NF-KB , we excluded this transcription factor as the nuclear factor responsible for differentially regulating the NF-kBI promoter .
In addition , the putative AP-1 site located in the NF-KkBI promoter was not found to affect PMA-induced transactivation of the NF-BI promoter ( 12 ) .
To test whether extracts from PMA/ PHA-stimulated cells would display Egr- 1 binding , EMSAs were performed .
As shown in Fig .
2 A , a P double stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the 68-bp Egr-1 site within the NF-BI promoter bound a nuclear protein which was present in PMA/ PHA-stimulated cell extracts ( lane 2 ) , but not in unstimulated cell extracts ( lane 7 ) .

- The Egr-1 DNA binding site is required for PMA/ PH A-responsive activation and for transcriptional synergy mediated by RelA and Egr-1 .
( A ) CEM cells were transfected with either the wild-type NF- « BI promoter ( SSLUC ) or with each of the site-directed mutants including ( a ) mNLUC , which contained a mutated NF-KB site at position -289 , ( b ) mELUC , which contained a disrupted 68-bp Egr-1 site , and ( c ) mNELUC , which contained mutated NF-B and Egr-1 sites , and 18 h later cells were stimulated with either PMA/PHA or TNF- « .
24 h after stimulation , cell extracts were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity .
( B ) CEM cells were co-transfected with either the SSLUC construct or with mutant reporters ( mN , ME , mNE ; 5 ug each ) and with various expression vectors ( 5 pg ) including an empty vector control , RelA , Egr-1 , or RelA plus Egr-1 .
Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and luciferase activities were determined .
( C ) The SSLUC construct was transfected into CEM cells along with either the vector control or with an Egr-1 expression construct .
18 h after transfection , cells were either left untreated or stimulated with PMA/PHA or TNF- « .
Cells were harvested 24 h after stimulation and extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity .
All transfection assays were performed in triplicate in three inde- pendent experiments .
competed with an excess of wild-type unlabeled oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) , but not by equal concentrations of a corresponding mutant Egr- 1 site ( lane 4 ) .
Moreover , this complex contained Egr-1 protein since incubation with an Egr-1-specific antibody completely supershifted the nuclear protein bound to the *P-probe ( lane 5 ) .
Pretreatment with cyclo-heximide , which has been previously demonstrated to block PMA-mediated increases in Egr-1 protein ( 15 ) , prevented the detection of Egr- 1-specific binding ( lane 6 ) .
Although we do not effectively detect SP1 binding under our EMSA conditions ( Fig .
2 A ) , we observed constitutive SP1 binding in nuclear extracts isolated from CEM cells using a modified binding protocol ( data not shown ) .
Since SPI binding to the -68 site was constitutive and completely independent of cellular stimulation mediated by either PMA/ PHA or TNF-a ( data not shown ) , we chose to focus on the inducible binding of the Egr-1 transcription factor .
To elucidate whether differential Egr-1 binding was observed in T cells after the addition of either PMA/PHA or TNF-a , nuclear proteins were isolated from stimulated CEM cells over a 4 h time course and EMSAs were performed using the Egr-1 consensus site .
After stimulation with PMA/PHA , Egr-1 binding begins to appear within 30 min and continues to increase at both 1 and 2 h with a slight decrease seen at 4 h ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Interestingly , no Egr-1 binding was observed in CEM cell extracts after TNF- « stimulation ( Fig .
2 B ) .
However , both PMA/ PHA- and TNF- « -stimulated CEM cells demonstrated NF-rB-specific binding after the addition of each inducer , confirming that CEM cells were capable of responding to TNF-a ( data not shown ) .
Identical results to those obtained in the CEM cell line were demonstrated in Jurkat T cells ( data not shown ) .
Collectively , these results indicate that the -68 site located in the NF-BI promoter is capable of binding the Egr-1 transcription factor and that , unlike PMA/PHA stimulation , TNF- « fails to stimulate Egr- 1 binding in T cell lines .
Effiaent PMA/PHA-Responsive Adivation of the NF-kBI Promoter Requires the Egr-1 DNA Binding Site _ To determine whether Egr-1 is required for PMA/ PHA responsive activation of the NF-kBI promoter , site-directed mutagenesis was performed .
Since the NF-kBI promoter is regulated directly by NF-KB ( 11 , 12 ) , we chose to mutate the -289 kB motif alone or in combination with the -68 Egr-1 binding site .
The four luciferase NF-kBI promoter constructs included ( @ ) SSLUC , the wild-type construct , ( 5 ) mNLUC , which contained a mutated NF-KB site at position -289 , ( 0 ) mELUC , which contained the disrupted 68-bp Egr-1 site , and ( d ) mNELUC , which contained mutated NF-KB and Egr-1 sites .
As shown in Fig .
3 A , site-directed mutagenesis of the Egr-1 binding element ( mELUC ) significantly diminished PMA/PHA-responsive activation of the NF-kBI promoter , but had very little or no effect on TNF-o-mediated stimulation .
In contrast , mutating the NF-kB -289 site alone had very little effect on either PMA/ PHA- or activation ( data not shown ) .
These results in conjunction with the promoter deletion studies ( shown in Fig .
1 B ) would strongly suggest that other kB binding sites ( namely - 103 and -11 ) are important for transcriptional activation .
Recently , McElhinny et al .
494 __ Egr-1 and NF-KB Control T Cell-activated NF-BI Transcription ( 22 ) demonstrated that the -11 NF-KB site was required for HIV-mediated induction of promoter in mono-cytes .
Although the -289 motif is probably not the only functional NF-kB motif , site-directed mutagenesis of both the Egr-1 and NF-KB elements ( mNELUC ) , resulted in a further decrease in PMA/ PH A-responsive stimulation compared to the mELUC construct ( Fig .
3 A ) .
Taking into account that mutagenesis of the Egr-1 site in the NF-kBI promoter significantly diminished PMA/PHA-responsive stimulation , these results indicate that the -68 Egr-1 site plays an important role in the activation of this gene in T lymphocytes .
NF-kB and Egr-1 T ransaiption Synergistically T rans-activate the NF-KkBI Promoter .
To further explore the ability of each of these transcription factors to activate the NF-kBI promoter , the wild-type as well as the site-directed mutant reporters were cotransfected with the empty expression plasmid or with constructs encoding either RelA , the p65 subunit of NF-kB , Egr-1 , or a combination of both .
As shown in Fig .
3 B , the SSLUC reporter was strongly transactivated after cotransfection with the RelA encoding expression construct , but only weakly activated by the overexpression of Egr-1 .
Interestingly , transfection with both RelA and Egr-1 resulted in a potent synergistic transactivation of the NF-kBI promoter .
Although the -289 kB site was important for R elA-mediated transacti-vation , mutagenesis of this element did not affect activation by Egr- 1 , nor did it affect RelA/ Egr-1 synergy ( Fig .
3 B ) .
This result would suggest that , in the presence of Egr-1 binding , other kB sites located within the promoter are used for the synergistic response .
Unlike the mNLUC reporter , mutagenesis of the Egr-1 site ( mELUC ) resulted in a significant reduction in RelA- , Egrl- , and RelA/Egr1-mediated activation of the NF-kBI promoter ( Fig .
3 B ) .
However , disruption of both the -289 and -68 sites ( mNELUC ) did not further diminish RelA/ Egr-1-medi-ated synergy .
This would suggest that overexpression of both of these transcription factors may indirectly lead to the activation of the NF-kBI promoter by upregulating other trans-acting elements , or that Egr-1 ( like NF-KB ) recognizes other DNA-binding sites within the NF- « kBI promoter .
Collectively , co-transfection studies strongly suggest that the Egr-1 DNA binding site is critical for both Egr-1-mediated transactivation and for R elA/ Egr-1-dependent synergy .
Although the Rel homology domain of RelA has been shown to be responsible for protein-protein interactions with transcription factors outside of the NF- « kB/ Rel family ( 23-26 ) , we were unable to demonstrate a physical interaction between RelA and Egr-1 , nor were we able to generate synergistic transactivation mediated by these factors using either a 3 X-NF-kB or 3 % -Egr-1 CAT reporter ( data not shown ) .
Egr-1 Complements TNF-a to Stimulate the NF-kB1 Promoter .
_ To determine whether the difference between PMA/ PHA- and TNF-o-stimulated NF-BI gene expression was due to the inability of TNF-a to activate Egr- 1 , CEM cells were transfected with the SSLUC reporter along with the 495 _ Cogswell et al .
empty vector control or with the Egr-1 expression construct and 24 h later cells were stimulated with PMA/ PHA or TNF- « .
As shown in Fig .
3 C , the fold increase between cells transfected with the vector control or with the Egr-1 expression construct was comparable to previous experiments , while PMA/ PHA-stimulated cells ( coexpressing Egr-1 ) displayed the highest level of NF-kBI activation .
Interestingly , cells transfected with Egr-1 and stimulated with TNF-a displayed a significant increase in promoter activity , compared to TNF-o-stimulated cells transfected with the vector control .
The ability of Egr-1 to augment TNF-o-mediated activation of the promoter was a direct effect since the transcriptional synergy was not observed with the mELUC construct containing the dis rupted Egr-1 binding site ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that the Egr-1 transcription factor can complement TNF-a « -mediated stimulation of the promoter .
Furthermore , our data suggests that the inability of TNF-a to activate Egr-1 may account for the difference between PMA/PHA- and TNF-o « -mediated gene expression in T cells .
Endogenous NF-kBI1 Gene Expression Is A ffeaed in T Cells Expressing Antisense Egr-1 RNA .
To determine the importance of the Egr-1 transcription factor on endogenous NF-kBI gene expression , we developed a CEM cell line which constitutively expressed antisense human Egr-1 RNA .
Total RN As were isolated from either CEM/ AsEgr-1 cells ( which express the human Egr-1 antisense RNA ) or from CEM/ CMV control cells ( which harbor the empty expression vector ) after the addition of either PMA/PHA or TNF-a over the time course indicated .
As shown in Fig .
4 A , CEM/ AsEgr-1 cells did not display significant increases in NF-BI transcripts until 4 h after PMA/ PHA addition , while the control cells ( CEM/CMV ) responded within 1 to 2 h with similar kinetics as the parental CEM cell line ( Fig .
1 A ) .
Interestingly , TNF-o-stimulated CEM/ AsEgr-1 cells demonstrated a reduction in NF- « kBI transcripts 30 min after activation .
Although TNF-a does not activate Egr-1 , it would appear that under conditions in which endogenous Egr-1 levels are reduced ( as with CEM/ AsEgr-1 cells ) , TNF-a stimulation represses NF-KBI transcription ( Fig .
4 A ) .
Although the level of Egr-1 protein in the CEM/ AsEgr-1 cells after PMA/PHA stimulation was significantly lower ( fivefold ) than protein levels observed in the control line , the antisense Egr-1 transcripts were not able to completely block PMA/ PH A-mediated increases in Egr-1 protein ( Fig .
4 B ) .
Perhaps for this reason CEM/ AsEgr-1 cells are still able to display PMA/ PH A-responsive upregulation of NF-BI transcripts but with slower kinetics .
In this paper we have demonstrated that to achieve full activation of the NF-BI promoter , T cell signals require not only the activation of NF-kB , but also the Egr-1 transcription factor .
Interestingly , it appears that the potent activation of NF-kB DN A binding activity by TNF-a is insufficient at inducing high levels of transcription .
This is consistent with the recent report that activation of NF-kB binding by TNF-a is insufficient at activating VCAM-1 A CEM/CMV CEM/AsEgr-1 .+ EMAPHA ( h } || £ TNF ( D ) 1 |+ EMAiPHA ( mu £ ThE- « ( ) 1 Figure 4 .

transcription in some cells , but the co-activation of NF-kB and IRF-1 in endothelial cells functions to stimulate transcription ( 27 , 28 ) .
Moreover , like NF-kB , Egr-1 is a relatively poor activator of NF-BI transcription .
Thus , it is the combined action of NF-kB and Egr-1 , both of which alone result in weak activation , that functions to synergistically stimulate the NF-B1 promoter .
A number of NFKB-responsive genes have been characterized and found to require Egr-1 DNA binding motifs for maximum transactivation .
Such genes include TNF-a , IL-2 , and ICAM-1 ( 17 , 29 , 30 ) .
In T cells TNF- « does not fully upregulate its own promoter , presumably because of the inability of cytokines to activate Egr-1 ( 17 ) .
However , primary human fibroblasts and mac rophage cell lines display dramatic increases in Egr-1 after TNF-a stimulation ( 15 ) .
Collectively , these studies would suggest that the synergistic potential mediated by the NF-kB and Egr-1 transcription factors are not only restricted by the type of stimuli , but also may depend on the particular cell type .
Thus , it appears that the functional interaction of NF-kB and Egr-1 in the context of a promoter is likely to mediate critical aspects of T cell signaling and potentially other important aspects of cellular growth control .
The potent synergy between NF-kB and Egr-1 may explain , at least partially , the requirements for these transcription factors in T cell proliferation with NF-kBI being a critical downstream target for Egr-1 .
We would like to thank Dr. Vikas P. Sukhatme for providing the human Egr-1 cDNA .
We would also like to thank S. Scott Drouin for technical assistance in the preparation of this manuscript .
