Regulation of Interleukin-2 Receptor a Chain Expression and Nuclear Factor- « B Activation by Protein Kinase C in T Lymphocytes AUTOCRINE ROLE OF TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR a* ( Received for publication , May 6 , 1994 ) Felipe X. Pimentel-Muinios , Javier Mazana , and Manuel Fresnot Centro de Biologia Molecular , Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas , Universidad Autonoma Madrid , 28049 Madrid , Spain The regulation of interleukin-2 receptor « chain ( IL-2Ra ) expression and nuclear factor ( NF ) activation by protein kinase C ( PKC ) in resting T cells , has been stud-ied .
Treatment of human resting T cells with phorbol esters strongly induced the expression of IL-2Ra « and the activation of NF-KB .
This activation was due to the translocation of p65 and c-Rel NF- < B proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus , where they bound the « B sequence of the IL-2Ra promoter either as p50-p65 or as p50-c-Rel heterodimers .
Interestingly , all of those events were largely indirect and mediated by endogenously secreted tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa ) , as they were strongly inhibited by a neutralizing anti-INFa monoclonal antibody .
Furthermore , cyclosporin A , which blocked TNFa production induced by PKC , strongly inhibited IL-2Ra « and NF -B activation .
The addition of either TNFa or IL-2 partially recovered cyclosporin A-induced IL-2R « inhibition , but only TNFa completely recovered NF- « B activation .
Those results indicate that , in resting T cells , PKC activation has only a triggering role , whereas the endogenously secreted TNFa plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of IL-2Ra « chain or NF -B activation .
The activation of T cells through the T cell receptor ( TCR ) is a complex event that triggers several early intracellular sig-nals , such as tyrosine phosphorylation , the rise of the cytosolic Ca®* concentration , and the activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( 1 ) .
This activation can be mimicked by the simultaneous treatment of T cells with phorbol esters and Ca** ionophores ( 2 ) , indicating that PKC activation and intracellular Ca* rise are sufficient signals to activate T cells .
Those TCR-transduced signals induce the production of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and the membrane expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors ( IL-2Rs ) ( 3 , 4 ) .
Later , the interaction of these two molecules on the surface of T cells elicits a distinct set of signals that induces the T cells to proliferate ( 5 , 6 ) .
High affinity IL-2Rs are composed of at least three chains , a , B and y ( 7 ) .
The B and y chains are constitutively expressed in * This work was supported by grants from Direccion General de In-vestigacion Cientifica y Técnica and from Fundacion Ramon Areces , and Antibioticos Farma .

resting T cells , but the « chain is induced de novo upon T cell activation through TCR ( 7-9 ) .
Moreover , PKC activation is enough to induce IL-2Ra expression , which is regulated at the transcriptional level ( 10 , 11 ) .
The promoter region of the IL-2Ra gene contains one consensus site for the binding of the ubiquitous family of nuclear transcription factors ( NF ) : « B ( 12 , 13 ) .
These factors have been suggested to play a key role in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2Ra « gene ( 12 , 13-18 ) .
NF - « B are composed by hetero- and homodimers of a family of proteins that include the dorsal gene of Drosophila and the mammalian genes nf % B1 , c-rel , rel A , and rel B , all of them involved in gene regulation ( 19 ) .
The subunit composition of the different complexes defines the fine specificity of binding to the target sequences and their transactivating activity ( 20 , 21 ) .
All members share a homologous 300-amino acid region containing the essential domains for their activity : the DNA-binding domain , the dimerization domain , and the nuclear localization sequence ( 22 ) .
The factors are present in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of uninduced cells , retained by another family of proteins termed IkB that contain ankyrin repeats as common structural motif ( 23 ) .
In response to growth factors or different activators , those IxBs suffer postranscriptional modifications ( such as phosphorylation ) , that induce them to dissociate from NF- « B , allowing its transport to the nucleus and concomitant activation ( 23 ) .
T cell activation by PKC or through TCR , TNF-receptors , or CD28 activates NF- « B by inducing this nuclear translocation ( 24-29 ) .
TNFa is a cytokine mainly produced by activated macro-phages ( 30 ) , although it is also produced by T cells activated by several stimuli including phorbol esters ( 30-33 ) .
Moreover , TNFa induces IL-2Ra expression and NF- « B activation in T cells in a way similar to phorbol esters ( 10 , 24-26 , 34 ) .
We and others have previously described that TNFa induces the proliferation of suboptimally stimulated T cells .
This effect is thought to be mediated by the IL-2/IL-2R pathway ( 35-37 ) and is probably due to a TNFa-dependent increase of IL-Z2Ra « expression ( 34-37 ) .
In addition , recent results from our laboratory indicate that endogenously secreted TNFa plays a very important role in T cell activation through TCR/CD3 ( 38 ) .
In this paper , we address the question of the regulation of NF- « B activation and IL-2Ra expression by PKC in a physiological system such as primary T cells .
The implication of endogenously secreted lymphokines in those processes was also investigated .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents-Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ( PDB ) and staurosporine were obtained from Sigma , and CsA was obtained from Sandoz Pharmaceutical Co. ( Hanover , NJ ) .
Recombinant IL-2 was kindly provided by En-dogen ( Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) , and recombinant TNFa was a generous gift from Antibisticos Farma ( Madrid ) .
The neutralizing anti-TNF « mAb , B13.2 , was developed in our lab-oratory .
It does not cross-react with lymphotoxin ( TNFR ) and it is able 24424 Regulation of IL-2Ra and NF-kB by PKC in T Cells to neutralize the cytotoxic and T cell costimulatory activity of TNF « . ''
It was purified from ascitic fluid .
The MAR 108 mAb ( 87 ) is specific for IL-2Ra chain and was used as a culture supernatant for cytofluorometric analyses or as purified antibody for IL-2-neutralizing activity .
The anti-p50 NF- « B rabbit serum ( Serum 2 ( 39 ) ) , was a generous gift from Dr. Alain Israél .
The anti-c-Rel ( Serum 1136 ( 17 ) and Serum 265 ) , the anti-p65 ( Serum 1226 ) , and the anti-p50 ( Serum 1141 ) rabbit sera , were kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Rice ( 29 ) .
Cell Cultures-Human mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood of healthy donors by centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque ( Pharmacia Biotech , Inc. ) ( 37 ) .
Adherent cells were removed by adherence to plastic dishes , and T cells were purified by passing the nonadherent population through a nylon fiber wool column as described ( 40 ) .
The purity of this population ( assayed by flow cytometry ) , was always greater than 95 % CD3+* cells .
Purified T cells ( 10®/ml in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 1 % fetal calf serum ) were activated with different stimuli as indicated in each experiment .
The neutralizing anti-TNFa and anti-IL-2Ra antibodies and the drugs CsA and staurosporine , when used , were present in the cell culture prior to the addition of any other stimuli .
In the case of staurosporine , a preincubation of 1 h was carried out .
None of the reagents affected the viability of the cells at the concentrations used , as determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test .
Cytofluorometric Analysis-The surface expression of IL-2Ra chain ( CD25 ) was analyzed by immunofluorescence in an EPICS-C cytoflu-orometer ( Coulter Scientific , Harpenden , GB ) .
For this , purified T cells were cultured with the indicated stimuli in 96-well plastic plates .
After 40 h , cells were collected and treated with buffer glycine ( pH 2 ) in order to eliminate any possible bound antibody .
Cells were incubated with the hybridoma MAR 108 culture supernatant , followed by washing and labeling with fluorescein-labeled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin , as described ( 37 ) .
mRNA Detection-Specific mRNA levels were quantified by Northern blot analysis .
Total RNA was obtained from T cells after the indicated incubations , as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 41 ) .
Equal amounts ( between 5 and 8 ug ) of RNA were subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane ( Hybond-N , Amersham Corp. ) as described ( 42 ) .
The hybridizations were performed as previously reported ( 38 ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays-Nuclear extracts were obtained from T cells essentially by the previously described method ( 43 ) .
The binding assays were performed as reported ( 38 ) , using as labeled probe the -290 to -239 fragment of IL-2Ra promoter region ( 5'-GCT-CACCCTACCTTCAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCTTTTATGGG- ( 44 ) , containing the « B element and surrounding sequences .
The binding complexes were separated in a 5 % acrylamide gel , and their specificity was determined by competition with 50x molar excess of the same unlabeled oligonucleotide , AP2 ( 5-GATCGAACTGACCGC-CCGCGGCCCGT-3 ' ) , the -270 to -253 fragment of IL-2Re promoter ( « B-like element : 55-GCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCT-3 ' ) , immunoglobulin xB ( 5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3 ' ) , or the serum-responsive element also included in IL-2Ra promoter , flanked by HindIII and Sall restriction sites ( 5'-AGCTTTCTCCTTTTATGGGCGTAG-3 ' ) .
The protein composition of each DNA-protein complex was identified by supershifting assays using specific anti-NF- « B polyclonal rabbit antisera .
These assays were performed as normal EMSAs , except that 1 pl of the different anti-NF- « B antisera was added to the nuclear extract prior to the addition of the probe .
Western Blot Assays-The nuclear extracts were obtained as described above ( 43 ) , whereas the supernatants of the pelleted nuclei were considered cytoplasmic extracts .
Nuclear extracts ( 10 ug ) or cytoplasmic extracts ( 8 ng ) obtained from T cells incubated under the different conditions , were electrophoresed in a 10 % discontinuous polyacrilamide minigel .
The gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes ( Milli-pore , Bedford , MA ) using 10 mm CAPS ( pH 11 ) as transferring buffer .
The membranes were saturated by incubation at 4 °C overnight with 10 % nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline , 0.05 % Tween 20 , and then they were incubated with the different anti-NF- « B antibodies for 1 h at room temperature .
After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline , 0.05 % Tween 20 , they were incubated with an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to peroxidase , for 1 h at room temperature .
After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline , 0.05 % Tween 20 , the blots were developed using the Amersham ECL chemiluminiscence method .

Effect of endogenous TNF « and IL-2 on membrane expression of IL-2Ra by human T cells activated with PDB .
T cells were incubated in the absence or in presence of PDB ( 10 ng/ml ) , anti-IL-2Ra ( 50 ug/ml ) , or anti-TNFa ( 50 ug/ml ) , as indicated , during 40 h. After this incubation , the cells were collected and stained with specific anti-IL-2Ra mAb , and their fluorescence was quantified by flow cytom-etry .
The percentage of positive cells and the mean of the fluorescence ( MF ) of these positive cells are shown .
RESULTS IL-2R « induction and NF- « B activation are two of the most important events triggered by PKC activation in T cells ( 4 , 10 , 24 , 25 ) .
Furthermore , the effects of TNFa and phorbol esters in T cell activation are remarkably similar ( 10 , 24-26 , 34 ) .
As TNFa synthesis is induced by PKC activators in T cells , part of the effects of PKC activation could be , in fact , mediated by this cytokine .
To test this hypothesis , we studied the effect of the endogenously secreted TNFa on PDB-triggered IL-2Ra expression in the membrane of T cells using a neutralizing anti-TNFa « mAb to inhibit its action .
A representative experiment is shown in Fig .
1 .
PDB induced a strong expression of IL-2Ra « chain on the surface of human purified resting T cells , 40 h after activation .
Interestingly , this expression was strongly inhibited by the presence of neutralizing anti-TNFa or anti-IL-2Ra mAbs , indicating that PKC activation by itself has a very small effect on the expression of IL-2Ra « chain and suggesting that its effect is in fact mediated by the autocrine action of IL-2 and TNFa .
Northern blot analyses were carried out to know if those changes at the cell surface reflected changes in the mRNA levels .
Treatment of purified human T cells with PDB resulted in a strong induction of the expression of the two mRNAs specific for IL-2Ra ( Fig .
2 ) , which peaked at 20 h after PKC activation ( data not shown ) .
This induction was strongly inhibited ( ranging 70-80 % depending on the donor of cells ) by the presence of neutralizing anti-TNFa or anti-IL-2Ra « mAbs in the cell cultures .
This inhibition was almost as good as the one obtained with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine ( Fig .
2 ) .
To assess in a different way the exact contribution of the autocrine secretion of IL-2 and TNFa to the regulation of IL-2Ra , we inhibited their production with the drug CsA and supplemented the cultures with exogenous lymphokines .
This drug has been shown to inhibit the transcription of genes coding for several lymphokines without directly affecting those coding for their receptors ( 45 ) .
PDB induced the secretion of TNFa and low amounts of IL-2 by human purified T cells ( 38 ) , which was completely blocked by CsA ( data not shown ) .

Effect of endogenous TNFa and IL-2 on IL-2R « mRNA expression by human T cells activated with PDB .
T cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PDB ( 10 ng/ml ) , anti-IL-2Ra ( 50 ug/ml ) , anti-TNFa « ( 50 ug/ml ) , staurosporine ( 50 n ) , CsA ( 2 ug/ml ) , IL-2 ( 20 units/ml ) , or TNFa ( 500 units/ml ) , as indicated , during 20 h. After this incubation , total RNA was obtained , and equal amounts of it were subjected to Northern blot assays using an IL-2Ra-specific *P-radiola-beled probe .
All membranes were rehybridized with a specific 28 S rRNA probe ( as shown at the bottom of each figure ) and scanned in the linear range of the film .
The absorbance values shown under each lane were corrected with the relative amounts of rRNA in each lane and standarized with respect to the control lane .
inhibited ( 80-90 % ) in the presence of the drug .
A representative experiment is shown in Fig .
2 .
This expression could be partially recovered by the exogenous addition of either TNFa or IL-2 and totally rescued by the addition of both lymphokines together .
Those results indicate that the autocrine action of both lymphokines plays an essential role in the induction of the « chain of the IL-2R by PKC .
The activation of the transcription factor NF-kB , which is thought to have a relevant role in the control of IL-2Ra « expression ( 12-18 ) , is another typical event that occurs upon PKC activation or TNFa treatment of T cells ( 24-26 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that the endogenously secreted TNFa induced by PKC activation could be mediating the PKC-triggered activation of NF-kB .
In order to test this hypothesis , we performed EMSAs with nuclear extracts from T cells activated by PDB in the absence or presence of the neutralizing anti-TNFa « mAb or CsA .
Those assays were carried out approximately 5-6 h before the maximum synthesis of IL-2Ra « mRNA in order to look for a possible correlation between both phenomena .
The -290 to -239 oligonucleotide present in the promoter of IL-2Ra « was used as a probe .
This fragment contains a « B element and other surrounding sequences that have also been involved in the transcriptional regulation of IL-2Ra « ( 15 , 18 , 44 , 46 ) .
The specificity of the different DNA-protein complexes was assayed by competition with a molar excess of the unlabeled probe or the unrelated oligonucleotide AP2 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Four specific complexes of the probe with nuclear proteins from PDB-activated T cells were detected ( Fig .
3 ) .
The composition of each complex was determined by competition with a molar excess of the two internal oligonucleotides that had previously been identified as being recognized by nuclear factors : serum-responsive element and kB elements ( 44 ) .
As can be observed in Fig .
3 , the upper band was efficiently competed by -290 to -239 fragment and by the serum-responsive IL-2Ra « element ( -256 to -239 ) but not by AP2- or « B-related oligonucleotides , indicating that this complex is formed by the binding of serum-responsive factor ( SRF ) to the -256 to -- 239 fragment .
However , the three lower bands were competed by the -290 to -239 oligonucleotide , the kB IL-2Ra « element ( -270 to -253 ) or the immunoglobulin « B one , but not by AP2 or the serum-responsive IL-2Ra « element , indicating that they are formed by NF- « B-related proteins recognizing the -270 to -253 IL-2Ra « element .
The nucleus of resting T cells only contained the SRF factor and the lower molecular weight NF - « kB complex ( Fig .
4 ) .

DNA-protein complexes from PDB-activated T cells obtained with -290 to -239 fragment of IL-2Ra « promoter .
T cells were incubated in the presence of PDB ( 10 ng/m ! )
during 16 h. After this incubation , nuclear extracts were obtained , and EMSAs were performed using the -290 to -239 fragment ( **P-labeled ) of IL-2Ra « promoter as a probe .
As indicated , the binding assays were preincubated in presence of a 50x molar excess of the different unlabeled oligonucleotides as competitors .
during 16 h , strongly induced the expression of the two upper NF - « B complexes .
A small increase in the amount of the lower NF- « B complex could also be detected .
No significant variation in the levels of the SRF band were detected upon PDB treat-ment .
Very interestingly , the addition of a neutralizing antiTNFa mAb strongly inhibited ( reproducibly by 80-95 % ) the PDB-induced expression of the two upper NF- « B bands and prevented the small variation of the PDB-induced expression of the lower NF-kB band .
This blockade was similar to that induced by the PKC inhibitor , staurosporine ( Fig .
4 ) .
CsA also inhibited NF- « B activation , and this inhibition could be efficiently prevented by the addition of TNFa , but not IL-2 .
Reproducible results were obtained with different donors .
All of those data indicate that the effect of PDB on the binding of nuclear NF -B to its target sequences , when IL-2Ra « starts to peak after activation , is almost completely mediated by the endogenously secreted TNFa .
In order to identify the subunit composition of each of the three NF- « B-related complexes detected , supershifting EMSAs using different specific anti-NF- « B antisera were carried out .
For this , nuclear extracts from resting or PDB-activated T cells were preincubated with specific polyclonal antisera raised against different members of the NF- « B family : p50 ( n/kB1 ) , p65 ( rel A ) , or c-Rel .
As can be observed in Fig .
5 , the upper NF - « B band was supershifted by both anti-p50 and anti-p65 antisera , the middle band by both anti-p50 and anti-c-Rel , and Regulation of IL-2Ra and NF-kB by PKC in T Cells PDB CsA 3 TNFa - 3 - c i / 3 PoB IL-2 w tow ® Pu anti- TNFo .

Effect of endogenous TNFa on NF- « B activation induced by PDB treatment in human T cells .
T cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PDB ( 10 ng/ml ) , CsA ( 2 ug/ml ) , staurosporine ( 50 nm ) , TNFa ( 500 units/ml ) , IL-2 ( 100 units/ml ) , or anti-TNF mAb ( 50 ug/ml ) , as indicated , during 16 h. After this incubation , nuclear extracts were obtained and EMSAs were performed using the -290 to -239 fragment ( P-labeled ) of IL-2Ra « promoter as a probe .
The absorbance values for the scanning analysis , performed in the linear range of exposition , of the two upper NF-kB complexes were obtained by subtracting the value of the control lane and are shown at the bottom of each lane .
the lower band was only supershifted by the anti-p50 anti-serum .
A similar result was obtained with the lower NF-kB complex in assays performed in resting T cells , which constitutively express it ( Fig .
5 ) .
No supershifting was detected when the probe was incubated with the antibodies in the absence of nuclear extract or when an irrelevant antiserum was present in the binding mixture ( data not shown ) .
Those results clearly indicate that the upper complex is formed by p50-p65 heterodimers , the middle one contains p50-c-Rel heterodimers , and the lower one only contains p50 subunits , probably as p50 homodimers ( Fig .
5 ) .
To test if the changes in the amount of active NF-kB proteins complexed with the « kB probe in the different conditions of activation were accompanied with variations in the nuclear or cytoplasmic levels of the different proteins , Western blots with nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were carried out .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from resting or PDB-activated T cells ( in the absence or presence of the different indicated agents ) , were blotted with anti-p50 , anti-p65 , or anti-c-Rel polyclonal anti-bodies .
As can be observed ( Fig .
6 ) , the expression of the p50 protein in the nucleus of resting T cells was high , in agreement with the EMSAs shown in Fig .
4 , where a strong expression of the p50 containing NF-kB complex was detected .
By contrast , undetectable levels of p65 protein and low amounts of c-Rel protein were found in the nucleus of resting T cells , also in agreement with the EMSAs shown in Fig .
4 .
Treatment of cells with PDB induced the presence of p65 and a strong increase of c-Rel proteins in the nucleus .
Interestingly , both phenomena were strongly inhibited ( varying 80-95 % between different do-nors ) by the presence of an anti-TNFa mAb or by CsA .
Addition of TNFa was able to completely revert CsA inhibition .

Characterization of the subunit composition of the different specific NF- « B complexes .
T cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml PDB during 16 h. After this incubation , nuclear extracts were obtained and EMSAs were performed using the -290 to -239 fragment ( P-labeled ) of IL-2R « promoter as a probe .
As indicated , the binding assays were preincubated in presence of specific anti-p50 ( Serum 2 ) , p65 or c-Rel ( Serum 1136 ) antisera .
triggered a small increase in the amount of nuclear p50 protein , which was slightly inhibited by the presence of a neutralizing anti-TNFa mAb or CsA .
In this last case , the expression was also recovered by the addition of TNFa .
By contrast , the levels of the cytoplasmic reservoirs of the three proteins were high in resting T cells , including the p105 precursor of p50 ( 47 ) and did not change significantly with any of the treatments used ( Fig .
6 ) .
DISCUSSION NF- « B activation is one of the most characteristic events triggered by PKC activation in T cells ( 24-26 ) .
However , very little is known about the detailed mechanisms of NF- « B activation by PKC in a physiological system such as primary cultures of normal resting T cells , as most of the studies on NF-kB regulation have been performed in transformed T cell lines where its regulatory mechanisms can not faithfully reflect the physiological ones .
We show here that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters in resting human T cells strongly induced the translocation of p65 and c-Rel NF-kB proteins to the nucleus , where they bind the -290 to -239 IL-2Ra « fragment as p50-p65 and p50-c-Rel heterodimers .
Surprisingly , the effect of PKC activation on NF-kB seems to be mostly indirect and mediated by endogenously secreted TNFa , since it could be almost completely inhibited by the presence of a neutralizing anti-TNFa « mAb .
We also show that the induction of the expression of IL-2Ra « by PKC activation in T cells , both at the membrane and mRNA levels , was indirect .
However , this effect was mediated by the endogenously secreted TNFa and IL-2 , as it was almost totally inhibited by neutralizing anti-TNFa or anti-IL-2R « mAbs .
Our results were confirmed by evaluating the effect of their addition in a lymphokine-free background .

Effect of endogenous TNF « in the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of the different NF- « B proteins of T cells activated with PDB .
T cells were incubated in absence or in presence of PDB ( 10 ng/ml ) , CsA ( 2 ug/ml ) , TNFa ( 500 units/ml ) , or anti-TNF « mAb ( 50 ug/ml ) , as indicated , during 16 h. After this incubation , nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained , and Western blot assays were performed using specific anti-p50 ( Serum 1141 ) , p65 , or c-Rel ( Serum 265 ) antisera .
The absorbance values for the scanning analysis of the bands ( performed in the linear range of exposition ) obtained with nuclear extracts are shown at the bottom of each lane .
All values were referred to the absorbance of the PDB lane .
The absorbance values of the bands obtained with cytoplasmic extracts are not shown , because the slight changes observed were not reproducible between different experiments .
ticularly important in our system , because we have used primary T cell cultures that have a variable response to activation ( and concomitantly different levels of endogenous lympho-kines ) between different donors .
This was achieved with the immunosuppressive drug CsA , which inhibits the endogenous secretion of lymphokines .
We have found that CsA inhibited the PDB-triggered NF -B activation and that the addition of TNFa alone could prevent this inhibition .
Similarly , CsA inhibited the expression of IL-2R « , and either TNFa or IL-2 could recover the IL-2Ra expression , although not entirely .
A total recovery of the IL-2Ra « expression was only seen in the presence of both TNFa and IL-2 .
Our results may explain why the effects of PDB and TNFa in T cells are greatly overlapping ( 10 , 24-26 , 34 ) .
A study of the effects of different deletions in the promoter of the IL-2Ra « gene indicated that their quantitative response to phorbol esters and TNFa correlate quite well ( 24 ) .
Moreover , they showed that the enhancer region responsible for the action of phorbol esters and TNFa is located between the -291 and -245 nucleotides of the promoter ( 24 ) .
This fragment contains a kB consensus recognized by NF- « B proteins , which are also activated by PKC and TNFa ( 12 , 13 , 26 ) .
Our results , indicating that the effect of PDB on IL-2Ra expression or NF « B activation in human purified T cells is mediated through the endogenous activity of TNFa , may explain those close correlations .
In addition , the endogenously secreted IL-2 has also an important role in the control of PDB-induced IL-2Ra « expression , since it could be greatly inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-2R « mAbs .
Moreover , IL-2 partially rescued IL-2Ra « expression from CsA inhibition , similar to TNFa .
This suggests that PKC activation in T cells triggers the expression of IL-2R « but the quantitative regulation of its expression is mediated by the Regulation of IL-2Ra and NF-kB by PKC in T Cells TNFa and IL-2 present in the supernatant .
Interestingly , both anti-TNFa « and anti-IL-2R « mAbs inhibited each one more than 50 % of the IL-2Ra « expression .
This seems to exclude the possibility of completely unrelated effects of TNFa and IL-2 on the different T cell subpopulations present in the cultures .
Rather , this suggests the existence of an interconnected loop of amplification of the expression of IL-2R « chain by the two lymphokines .
Another remarkable correlation that can be deduced from our results is the similar behavior of IL-2Ra « and NF- « B regu-lation .
Both phenomena are strongly inhibited by an antiTNFa mAb or CsA , and , in this last case , the exogenous addition of TNFa can restore the expression of both .
This close correlation supports that NF-kB has a relevant role in the transcriptional regulation of IL-2Ra « chain in resting T cells , as has been suggested by other groups by transfecting different fragments of the IL-2Ra « promoter into T cell lines or T cell blasts ( 12 , 15 , 18 , 24 , 25 ) , or by cotransfecting IL-2Ra « promoter fragments together with the c-rel cDNA NF-kB subunit ( 17 ) .
Our results also suggest that the previously described transcriptional enhancing effect of IL-2 in IL-2Ra « expression ( 48 , 49 ) , is not mediated by NF -B , as no translocation of this factor was induced by IL-2 despite having a strong effect in IL-2R « mRNA levels ( Figs .
2 and 3 ) .
This is in disagreement with previous reports showing that IL-2 can induce activation of NF- « B in T cell lines and in primary T cells ( 50 ) .
The reason for this discrepancy is not clear , but it may lie in the fact that they use high concentrations of IL-2 in their assay , without addressing the contribution of endogenously secreted lymphokines .
Since it is well known that IL-2 at those concentrations may induce TNFa ( 51 ) , it is , therefore , possible that the effect attributed to IL-2 would be in fact an IL-2-induced TNFa-medi-ated effect .
The effect of CsA on IL-2Ra « expression has been controver-sial .
Thus , either a strong inhibitory effect ( 52 , 53 ) or no effect ( 54 , 55 ) of CsA on the expression of IL-2R « mRNA has been reported .
As our experiments now suggest , those discrepancies could be due to the relative contribution of endogenous cyto-kines in the different systems ( different cell types , different timings or different stimuli ) used .
On the other hand , several groups have described a partial inhibitory effect of CsA on the induction of NF-kB by phytohemagglutinin plus the phorbol ester PMA in both primary and transformed T cells ( 56 , 57 ) , results that would be in agreement with our data .
However , they do not address the relevance of endogenous lymphokines as we have done .
Alternatively , CsA could directly affect NF- « B activation by preventing its transport to the nucleus , as has been described for NF-AT ( 58 ) , or by inhibiting the activity of some of the PKC subtypes , as recently reported ( 59 ) .
However , those effects are unlikely to explain the observed blockade of CsA in the IL-2Ra « expression or NF- « B activation , since those inhibitions were prevented by the exogenous addition of TNFa .
Our results indicate that PKC activation induces NF-kB activation through the induction of p65 and c-Rel in the nucleus , where they bind the IL-2Ra « promoter as heterodimers with p50 .
However , the cytoplasmic levels of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel proteins seemed to remain unaltered by the treatments used , even those that , by inhibiting the action of endogenously secreted TNFa , caused a strong impairment of nuclear expression of p65 or c-Rel .
Therefore , the permissive effect of the endogenous TNFa on the nuclear expression of NF-kB seems to be exerted in its transport to the nucleus .
Moreover , we did not detect variations in the levels of p65 NF-kB mRNA by antiTNFa or CsA* *F. X. Pimentel-Muinos , and M. Fresno , unpublished results .
Regulation of IL-2Ra and NF-kB by PKC in T Cells 24429 17 .
Tan , T. , Huang , G. P. , Sica , A. , Ghosh , P. , Young , H. A. , Longo , D. L. , and Rice , We have used a rather long « B probe to perform the EMSAs .
The probe contains the < B element present in the IL-Z2Ra promoter ( located between nucleotides -268 and -257 ) , but it also contains other surrounding sequences ( -290 to -239 ) that had been previously involved in the transcriptional regulation of IL-2Ra .
Those sequences include the target for the SRF ( -253 to -244 ) that , when mutated or deleted , abrogates the PKC-triggered transcriptional activity of a reporter gene under its control , transfected to T cell lines ( 15 , 44 ) .
This region also contains a consensus site for the binding of the SP1 factor ( -245 to -240 ) that has been involved as a transcriptional repressor of the IL-2Ra gene ( 46 ) .
The target sequence for an unknown factor called RA ( 44 ) is also located in this fragment ( -290 to -269 ) that , when mutated , either abrogates or increases , depending on the transfected cell type , the transcription directed by fragments of the IL-2Ra promoter ( 44 ) .
However , although we detected the SRF binding activity in the nucleus of resting and PKC-activated T cells , the putative RA or SP1 binding activities were not identified by competition analyses ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , neither the mobility nor the level of expression of the SRF factor varied upon PKC activation or with the different treatment used , suggesting that it does not have a relevant role in the activation of IL-2Ra « transcription during PKC activation in T cells .
All those discrepancies may lie in their use of T cell lines instead of purified T cells , which represents a more physiological source of resting T cells .
In summary , we show here that PKC activation of T cells induces the nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Rel proteins , where they bind the IL-2Ra promoter .
Moreover , this induction , as well as one of the most characteristic T cell activation events that had been previously directly linked to PKC activation , such as the induction of IL-2Ra , are , in fact , mainly due to the activity of endogenously secreted TNFa .
Therefore , TNFa emerges as one of the major inducers of IL-2Ra « and NF- « B , playing a previously underestimated role in T cell activation .
