Masahiko Watabe , Nobuko Kawazoe , Yutaka Masuda , Shigeo Nakajo , and Kazuyasu Nakaya* Laboratory of Biological Chemistry , School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Showa University , 1-5-8 Hatanodai , Shinagawa-ku , Tokyo 142 , Japan Abstract In a previous study , we demonstrated that bufalin , which is an active principle of Chinese medicine , chan'su , caused apoptosis in human leukemia U937 cells by anomalous activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) via the signaling pathway of Ras , Raf-1 , and MAPK kinase-1 .
Here , we report the effect of overexpression of bei-2 in U937 cells on the signaling pathway of apoptosis that is induced by bufalin .
The results indicated that the apoptosis induced by bufalin in U937 cells was significantly inhibited by overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein .
No significant difference was detected in the activation of MAPK kinase-1 that is induced by bufalin in wild-type or Bcl-2-overexpressed U937 cells ; however , the activation of MAPK by bufalin was significantly attenuated in the cells overexpressing Bcl-2 .
Bufalin treatment activated activator protein-1 transcriptional activity ; however , this activation was decreased to 40 % in bel-2-overexpressed U937 cells .
These results indicate that Bcl-2 acts downstream of MAPK kinase-1 but upstream of MAPK and suggest that , in the signaling pathway of the apoptotic process induced by bufalin , the transcriptional activity of activator protein-1 may be down-regulated through the inhibition of MAPK activity by Bcl-2 .
Introduction Several genes have been identified as either inducers or repressors of apoptosis .
Among these is bel-2 ( B-cell lymphoma-2 ) , which is known as an antiapoptotic gene .
It was first discovered by virtue of its involvement in the t ( 14 ; 18 ) chromosomal translocations found in the majority of non-Hodgkin 's B-cell lymphomas ( 1 , 2 ) .
The biochemical mechanism of action of this M , 25,000-26,000 Bel-2 protein remains enigmatic .
The predicted amino acid sequence of Bcl-2 shares no significant homology with other proteins having known functions .
Hockenbery et al .
( 3 ) proposed that Bcl-2 functions in an antioxidant pathway .
On the contrary , Steinman proposed that Bcl-2 acts as a pro-oxidant , generating reactive oxygen intermediates in Escherichia coli ( 4 ) .
Oltvai et al .
( 5 ) suggested that some functions of Bcl-2 are mediated through the interaction with Bax , a Bcl-2 homologue .
Recently , Bcl-2 protein has been reported to be physically associated with p72 Raf-1 , which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase ( 6 ) , and with p23-R-Ras ( 7 ) , which is a GTPase member of the Ras family ( 8 ) .
This suggests that this antiapoptotic protein may participate in a signal transduction pathway via Ras/Raf-1 .
In cotransfection studies using a diploid hematopoietic cell line , the combination of elevations in the Bcl-2 protein level and Raf-1 kinase activity was shown to provide synergistic protection to the cell from death induced by growth factor withdrawal ( 6 ) .
However , the function of Raf-1 and the significance of its interaction with Bel-2 in the regulation of cell death remains unclear .

In our previous study , we found that bufalin , which is one of the components of bufadienolides in the traditional Chinese medicine , chan'su , and which is prepared from toad venom , is able to induce apoptosis in various human tumor cell lines ( 9 ) .
We also found that bufalin causes an anomalous activation of MAPK via Ras in promonocytic leukemia U937 cells ( 10 ) .
The persistent activation of MAPK in U937 cells in response to bufalin was caused by the cooperative interaction of two different signaling pathways .
Namely , Raf-1 was activated both by the activation of Ras and by the decrease in the levels of cAMP .
In the present study , we investigated the effect of the Bcl-2 protein on the MAPK cascade and AP-1 transcriptional activity in the apoptotic process induced by bufalin .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture .
Human promonocytic leukemia U937 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank ( Tokyo , Japan ) .

Geneticin ( G418 sulfate ) and an antibody against Bcl-2 were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Ltd. ( Tokyo , Japan ) .
The peptides , FLTEYVATRWYRAPEIMLN and KRELVEPLTPAGEAPN-QALLR , were chemically synthesized with a model 431A peptide synthesizer ( Applied Biosystems , Inc. ) .
Cleavage from the 4-hydroxymethylphenoxy-methylpolystyrene-resin was performed with 95 % ( v/v ) TFA .
The peptides were applied to a C8 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column ( Prep-10 Aquapore , 10 x 250 mm ) .
The column was washed with 0.1 % ( v/v ) TFA and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0O-70 % ( v/v ) acetnitrile containing 0.1 % ( v/v ) TFA , at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 60 min .
Construction of Expression Vector .
The 0.9-kb EcoRI fragment containing the open reading frame of a human be/-2 cDNA was inserted into the HinclI site of a pUCI19 cloning vector .

The cells ( 1 X 10° cells per well ) were plated onto 96-well microplates and cultured in RPMI 1640 .
After 24 h of culture , geneticin was added at a final concentration of 400 ug/ml , and the subclones were isolated 2-3 weeks later .
RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis .

THE MECHANISM OF APOPTOSIS INHIBITION BY Bcl-2 PROTEIN indicated .
Cell viability was determined by counting the cells that excluded trypan blue dye .
Preparation of Cell Lysate .
U937 cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS .
The washed cells were lysed with 0.4 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 7.4 ) , 1 mm EDTA , 0.5 mm EGTA , 0.15 m NaCl , 5 ug/ml aprotinin , 5 ug/ml leupeptin , 5 pg/ml pepstatin A , 5 .
ug/ml antipain , 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 50 mm NaF , 2 mm sodium orthovanadate , 10 mm Na PP , , and 1 % ( w/v ) Triton X-100 .
The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 % g for 20 min .
The supernatant thus obtained was used for immunoblotting and for the measurement of protein kinase activities .
Inimunoblotting .
Cell lysates containing 20 ug of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE .
The proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene diflu-oride membrane using a wet blotting apparatus at 0.5 V/em* constant voltage for 3.5 h in an ice-cold bath .
The membrane was first washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer ( pH 7.4 ) containing 0.15 m NaCl ( TBS ) and then blocked with 3 % ( w/v ) BSA in TBS for 30 min at room temperature .
The blocked membrane was subsequently probed with the anti-Bcl-2 antibody , diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1 % ( w/v ) BSA , and incubated for 1 h at room temperature .
After washing with TBS containing 0.1 % ( w/v ) Tween 20 , the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG ( H & L ; American Qualex ) , diluted 1:2000 in TBS containing 0.1 % ( w/v ) BSA .
The membrane was then washed with TBS containing 0.1 % ( w/v ) Tween 20 , and the protein bands visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system .

Effect of the overexpression of Bcl-2 proteins on cell viability and DNA fragmentation .
Transfected U937 cells ( 5 X 10° cells ) were deprived of serum for 24 h and then treated with 10~® m bufalin in serum-free RPMI 1640 for the times indicated .
Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion ( 4 ) .

Cell lysates prepared from these cells were analyzed with an antibody against Bcl-2 by immunoblotting ( Fig .

High and low levels of Bel-2 protein expression were detected in U937 , , , , , , and U937m1q cells , respectively .
These two cell lines were used for additional experiments .
Inhibition of Bufalin-induced Apoptosis by Bel-2 .
To avoid the effects of growth factors in the serum , cells were maintained in the medium without FCS for 24 h and then treated with 10~® m bufalin in this medium .
Cell viability was measured at the times indicated in Fig .

Cell viability of the U937 , clone was decreased by the bufalin treatment after 24 h to 40 % , which is similar to the viability obtained for U937wyf , cells ( 10 ) .

This result was consistent with that of the agarose gel electrophoresis .
These results indicate that apoptosis induced by bufalin in U937 cells was inhibited by the overexpression of Bcl-2 protein .
Effect of Bel-2 Overexpression on Activation of MAPK Cas-cade .
Recently , we have demonstrated that bufalin induces activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in U937 cells ( 10 ) .
As shown in Fig .

The degree of activation of MAPK in U937 , , cells caused by bufalin was quite similar to that reported for U937 , , cells ( 10 ) .
The activation was significantly suppressed in the Bcl-2-overexpressing cells .

3B ) .
In the present study , no significant inhibition of the MAPKK-1 activation induced by bufalin was observed in U937 , ,. , , , or U937 , ,. , , , , cells .
This is in contrast to the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on the MAPK activation induced by bufalin .
These results suggest that Bcl-2 protein acts downstream of MAPKK-i and inhibits the activity of MAPK .
Effect of Bcl-2 Overexpression on AP-1 Transcriptional Activity .
Because AP-1 is reported to be downstream of the MAPK cas-cade , we examined the effect of the overexpressed Bcl-2 protein on AP-1 transcriptional activity .
When U937y , and cells were treated with 10~® m bufalin for 6 h , AP-1 transcriptional activity was markedly increased ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , the activation of AP-1 activity induced by bufalin was slightly reduced in bc/-2-transfected U937ai.q cells and significantly in Bcl-2-transfected U937 , . , ; , cells .
This result indicates that Bcl-2 protein inhibits the activation of MAPK induced by bufalin , and this leads to the decreased transcriptional activity of AP-1 .
Discussion Here , we investigated the effect of Bcel-2 overexpression on the induction of apoptosis by bufalin treatment in U937 cells .
When wild-type U937 cells were treated with 10~® m bufalin , several lines of evidence , such as cell viability , chromosomal DNA laddering , and morphological change of the cells and nuclei , indicated that bufalin induced typical apoptosis as described previously ( 14 ) .
In contrast , the apoptosis induced by bufalin was attenuated in be/-2-transfected U937 cells .
When wild-type U937 cells were treated with bufalin , the anomalous activation of MAPK was observed ( 10 ) .
However , little is known about the relationship between the expression of Bcl-2 and the signaling pathway of MAPK .
To examine the effect of Bcl-2 on the MAPK pathway , we measured the activities of MAPKK-1 and MAPK in Bcl-2-overexpressing U937 cells that had been treated with bufalin .
There was a marked activation of MAPKK-1 induced by bufalin in as well as in U937 , , , , , and U937 , , cells , suggesting that Bel-2 does not act upstream of MAPKK-1 in the signal transduction pathway in U937 cells .
Consistent with our result , Wang et al .
( 6 ) demonstrated that Bcl-2 protein did not affect the activity of Ras or Raf-1 in the apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation of a diploid hematopietic cells .
In contrast to the effect of Bel-2 overexpression on MAPKK-1 activity , a significant inhibition of the MAPK activity was observed .
Although the MAPK activity in the vector-transfected cells increased approximately 1.9-fold upon treatment with 10~® m bufalin , the activation was significantly inhibited in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells , especially in U937 , ,._ , , , cells .
The results indicate that Bcel-2 plays an important role downstream of MAPKK-1 and upstream of MAPK in the MAPK signaling pathway in cell death induced by bufalin .
AP-1 is thought to be located downstream of MAPK , and the transcriptional activity of AP-1 is affected by MAPK ( 15 ) .
As demonstrated in the present study , bufalin increased the activity of AP-1 in both wild-type and vector-transfected cells , but approximately 63 % of the increased activity was attenuated in be/-2-overexpressed U937n .
; .3 , ; cells .
It is possible that this inhibition is due to the attenuation of the MAPK activity caused by the overexpression of Bcl-2 .
This may be one of the mechanisms by which Bcl-2 suppresses cell death .
Further work is needed to clarify the physiological role of Bcl-2 .
