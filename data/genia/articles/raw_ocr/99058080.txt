Structurally , the LCR is defined by the presence of four domains of erythroid-specific chromatin structure .
These domains , which have been characterized as DNase 1 hypersensitive sites ( HSs ) , comprise the active elements of the LCR .
The major focus of this research is to define the cis-acting elements which are required for the formation of these domains of unique chromatin structure .
Our previous investigations on the formation of LCR HS4 demonstrated that NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA binding sites are required for the formation of the native HS .
Similarly arranged NF-E2 and tandem GATA sites are present within the core regions of the other human LCR HSs and are evolutionarily conserved .
Using site-directed mutagenesis of human HSs 2 and 3 we have tested the hypothesis that these NF-E2 and GATA sites are common requirements for the formation of all LCR HSs .
We find that mutation of these elements , and particularly the GATA elements , results in a decrease or complete loss of DNase I hypersensitivity .
These data imply the presence of common structural elements within the core of each LCR HS which are required for erythroid-specific chromatin structure reorganization .
INTRODUCTION The human B-globin gene locus contains five expressed globin genes ( Fig .
1 ) .
These genes are expressed only in cells of the erythroid lineage and are regulated in a developmentally specific pattern ( 1 ) .
This complex pattern of gene expression makes the human -globin locus a model for studying the regulation of complex multi-gene loci .
In particular , the -globin gene locus has served as an important model for studies investigating the interaction between chromatin structure and gene expression in higher eukaryotic organisms .
In erythroid cells , the chromatin structure of the human } -globin gene locus undergoes a dramatic reorganization .
These changes are most often demonstrated as alterations in the nuclease sensitivity of the locus ( Fig .
1 ) .
In erythroid cells , the entire locus becomes more sensitive to DNase I digestion ( 2,3 ) .
A second change involves the formation of DNase I hypersensitive sites ( HSs ) in association with the promoters of actively transcribed 3-globin genes ( 4 ) .
A third type of erythroid-specific chromatin structure is the DNase I 'super or 'major ' HS .
These HSs flank the globin structural genes ( 5-7 ) .
5 ' HSs 1-4 comprise the B-globin locus control region ( LCR ) ( Fig .
1 ; 8,9 ) .
Several lines of evidence indicate a link between the chromatin structure of the human -globin gene locus and human -globin gene regulation .
These studies also suggest that the B-globin LCR is the primary determinant of locus chromatin structure .
For example , natural deletion mutations of the LCR result in complete silencing of structurally intact B-globin genes ( 2,10 ) .
This effect is demonstrated by the Hispanic y5f } -thalassemia mutation , in which LCR HSs 2 , 3 and 4 are deleted but all of the globin genes are intact ( 11 ) .
Not only are none of the genes expressed , but none of the characteristic erythroid-specific chromatin structures of the locus are formed ( 3 ) .
Neither the remaining LCR HS ( HS1 ) nor the promoter HSs are formed ( 3 ) .
Similarly , insertion of a hygromycin resistance gene between HS1 and HS2 of the human LCR in a mouse/human hybrid cell line resulted in silencing of globin gene expression and inhibition of HS formation downstream of the inserted gene ( 12 ) .
These results suggest that a primary function of the LCR is to establish an active chromatin structure throughout the locus .
A second link between LCR function and { -globin locus chromatin structure involves the ability of the LCR to direct position-independent expression of linked globin genes in transgenic mice .
This ability appears to be due to the capacity of the LCR to form a normal , active chromatin structure irrespective of the location at which the transgene is incorporated into the host genome ( 13 ) .
The formation of the LCR HSs is also likely to be important for the proper functioning of the LCR .
These domains of locally altered chromatin structure are unique in that they are erythroid-specific , *To whom correspondence should be addressed at : Department of Medicine , Hinman Box 7650 , Dartmouth Medical School , Hanover , NH 03755 , USA .

Perhaps most significant is the finding that the HSs are coincident with the functionally active core elements of the LCR ( 15-17 ) .
Similar results have been found for the chicken -globin 3 ' enhancer , which is also able to confer position-independent expression in transgenic mice ( 18-20 ) .
As with most DNase I HSs , the erythroid-specific reorganization of local chromatin structure associated with the LCR HSs appears to be due to the disruption or displacement of nucleosomes ( 14,21 ) .
In other systems , similar changes have been shown to be necessary for the binding of the full complement of trans-acting factors to a specific cis-acting element ( 22 ) .
As a step in understanding how the complex reorganization of -globin locus chromatin structure occurs we have focused on the mechanisms by which the LCR HSs are formed .
In our initial experiments we used human HS4 as a model for studying this process .
We demonstrated that a 1.3 kb fragment from the region of HS4 is able to direct the formation of HS4 in an erythroid-specific manner in transgenic mice ( 23 ) .
Subsequent truncation and deletion experiments indicated that an ~100 bp element near the center of HS4 is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the HS ( 23 ) .
We have termed this element the HS-forming element or HSFE .
Further analysis revealed that an NF-E2 binding site and tandem , inverted GATA sites are required for the formation of the native chromatin structure of HS4 ( 14 ) .
These binding sites are separated by ~50 bp .
The finding that NF-E2 and GATA binding sites are required for LCR HS formation provided at least a partial basis for the erythroid specificity of these HSs .
Examination of the DNA sequences of other LCR HS core regions revealed that similar NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA binding sites , also separated by ~50 bp , were found within the core region of each human LCR HS ( 14 ) .
These binding sites are evolutionarily conserved in the LCR HSs of chickens , rabbits , goats and mice ( 14,24 ) .
On the basis of these findings , we hypothesized that the NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA binding sites found in each of the human LCR HS cores are necessary for the formation of each of these domains of erythroid-specific chromatin structure .
If true , this would be consistent with a common underlying chromatin structure for each of the LCR HSs and would support a common mechanism of formation of the individual HSs .
To test this hypothesis we have performed site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA sites found within the core regions of human B-globin LCR HSs 2 and 3 .
These elements were then stably transfected into MEL cells and pools of clones evaluated for the ability of the mutant HSs to form .
Using micrococcal nuclease ( MNase ) we also performed a comparative analysis of the nucleosomal structures of the HSs .
MATERIALS AND METHODS HS2 and HS3 mutant constructs HS2 ( 1.45 kb , KpnI-Bgilll ) , HS3 ( 1.9 kb , HindIII-HindIII ) and HS4 ( 1.4 kb , BamHI-SphI ) fragments were subcloned into a previously described pUC-based plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene ( Fig .
1B ; 23 ) .

Mutations of HS3 were made within the pAHS3 plasmid , where HS4 and the neo® gene serve as positive , internal controls ( Fig .

Site-directed mutagenesis of individual NF-E2 and GATA binding motifs was performed using the Chameleon method ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
Oligonucleotides used in the mutagenesis procedure contained the mutated sequences shown in Figure 2 and ranged in size from 38 to 51 bp .
Multiple rounds of mutagenesis were performed to obtain constructs with multiple binding site mutations .
Test constructs were stably transfected into mouse erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells and pools of 25 clones selected in G418 as previously described ( 23 ) .
Nuclease sensitivity assays In vivo DNase I sensitivity assays were performed on nuclei isolated from pools of stable transfectants as previously described ( 14,23 ) .
For most experiments nuclei ( 200 ug DNA/reaction ) were digested in a volume of 200 pl with DNase I at concentrations of 0 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 and 4.0 ug/ml .
In some experiments the higher DNase I concentrations are not shown due to complete DNA digestion .
Reactions were performed at 37°C for 10 min .
Following DNase I treatment , genomic DNA was isolated and digested to completion with Xhol/Sa/I for Southern blots of H $ 2 mutants and X/hol for Southern blots of HS3 ( Fig .
1 ) .
For experiments focusing on individual HSs within the constructs Xhol/Bglll ( HS2 ) or HindIII ( HS3 ) were used for Southern blotting ( Fig .
1 ) .
The following probes were used for indirect end-labeling in Southern blot experiments ( Figs 1 and 6 ) : HS4 , 634 bp Sacl-Sacl fragment from the 5-end of HS4 fragment ; HS3 , 259 bp HindIII-Sacl fragment from the 5'-end of the HS3 fragment ; HS2 , 318 bp KpnI-Sacl fragment from the 5'-end of the HS2 fragment .
In vivo MNase assays of nucleosome positioning were performed as previously described ( 14 ) .
Regions of DNase I sensitivity and nucleosome position were mapped by plotting the migration distance of the molecular weight markers versus the logarithm of their size in base pairs .
These data points were then fitted to the equation fragment size ( bp ) = m [ emigration distance in cm ) ] , This produced a straight line where m is the slope of the line and i is the y-intercept .
Correlation coefficients for the plots were > 0.99 .
By measuring the migration distances of the upper and lower limits of each DNase I HS or MNase cutting site and applying the above formula the size , and therefore location , of each HS within the parental fragment was determined .
RESULTS To test our hypothesis that the NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA binding sites of each B-globin LCR HS are necessary for the formation of the associated domains of altered chromatin structure , we performed a mutational analysis of human LCR HSs 2 and 3 .
To do this we constructed plasmids containing the wild-type HS sequences .
Each plasmid also contained a second wild-type HS , either HS4 or HS3 , to serve as an internal control for LCR HS formation and a neo® gene for the selection of stable clones ( Fig .
1 ) .
The enhancer-promoter region of the neo® gene also forms a strong DNase I HS and serves as a second internal control .
This region contains a tandem repeat of a polyoma virus enhancer and the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter ( 25 ) .

enzyme sites are shown in Figure 1 .
When stably transfected into MEL cells , plasmids containing the LCR HS fragments are able to direct formation of their associated DNase I HSs ( 23,26 ) .
As shown in Figure 2 , site-directed mutagenesis was used to completely eliminate the NF-E2 and tandem GATA binding sites in individual constructs .
Individual constructs were then transfected into MEL cells .
Pools of 25 neomycin-resistant clones were selected and analyzed for the ability of the mutant constructs to form their associated DNase I HS .
Mutational analysis of LCR HS2 B-Globin LCR HS2 is unique in that it contains a strong erythroid-specific enhancer ( 27,28 ) .
This enhancer function is mediated through tandem NF-E2 binding sites located within the active core of the element ( 29 ) .
Besides NF-E2 , the binding sites are also able to bind the transcription factor AP-1 and NF-E2-related factors LCR-F1 and NRF2 ( 28,30,31 ) .
The tandem NF-E2 sites are located ~50 bp 5 of tandem , inverted GATA binding motifs .
Together they comprise the region homologous to the HS4 HSFE ( 14 ) .
To assess the role of the tandem NF-E2 sites and tandem , inverted GATA sites in LCR HS2 formation we performed site-directed mutagenesis of these binding elements .
The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 3 .
Analysis of the wild-type construct ( H2WT ) demonstrates several DNase I HSs .
These include the intense HS associated with the neo® gene , the primary ( 1° ) and secondary ( 2° ) HS3 sites and , near the bottom of the blot , HS2 .
Wild-type HS2 is of approximately the same sensitivity as 1° HS3 and the neo® HS and is typical of the 'super HSs of the LCR .
2° HS3 is much less sensitive to DNase I requiring 10- to 20-fold more enzyme to achieve cutting equal to 1° HS3 ( 14 ) .
These two levels of DNase I sensitivity allow for semi-quantitative determination of the DNase I sensitivity of mutant HSs .
Mutation of the tandem NF-E2 binding sites within the HS2 core ( mutant H2M1 ) produces a decrease in the sensitivity of the HS2 region to DNase I .
The intensity of HS2 is now approximately equivalent to that of 2° HS3 .
These results are similar to what we observed in our original mutational studies of HS4 , where mutation of the NF-E2 binding motif also resulted in a decrease in the sensitivity of HS4 ( 14 ) .
Mutation of the tandem , inverted GATA sites ( H2M2 ) also results in a decreased sensitivity of HS2 .
These findings are also similar to our previous results for HS4 .
Mutation of both the NF-E2 and GATA sites ( H2M3 ) results in the complete loss of HS2 .
This is despite the fact that all other factor binding sites in the region of the HS2 core remain intact .
These results recapitulate our findings for HS4 and support the hypothesis that the NF-E2 and GATA binding sites are critical for the formation of both HS $ 2 and HS4 .
Mutational analysis of LCR HS3 Experiments analyzing the role of NF-E2 and GATA binding sites in HS3 formation are shown in Figure 4 .
While HS3 does not possess the enhancer activity of HS2 , it has been recently shown to have the unique ability to confer position-independent expression on linked genes in single copy transgenic mice ( 32 ) .
Structurally , 1° HS3 is also unique in that it is comprised of an intense HS typical of the LCR super HSs and an immediately adjacent HS which is much less intense ( Fig .
4 , H3WT ) .
Also unique to HS3 is the presence of two sets of tandem , inverted GATA sites .
These are located ~50 bp 3 '' of the NF-E2 site and also ~110 bp 3 '' of the site ( Fig .
2 ) .
Analysis of the HS3 wild-type construct again shows several HSs .
These include the neoR-associated HS , the two HS3 sites and the internal control for these experiments , HS4 .
Note that in the wild-type construct the intensity of 1° HS3 is approximately equal to that of the neo® HS .
Mutation of the NF-E2 binding site ( H3M1 ) results in a minor decrease in the intensity of 1° HS3 when compared with the neo® internal control .
The next panel ( H3M2 ) shows that mutation of the proximal GATA sites has little effect on HS3 formation .
However , when the distal GATA sites are mutated ( H3M3 ) , the intensity of 1° HS3 is dramatically reduced to less than the level of 2° HS3 .
2° HS3 is unaffected by any of these mutations .
In Figure 5 the effect of mutating multiple binding sites within the 1° HS3 core region is shown .
Mutation of the NF-E2 and proximal GATA sites ( H3M4 ) causes the intensity of the site to be minimally decreased .
Mutation of both the NF-E2 and distal GATA sites ( H3M5 ) results in a marked decrease in the sensitivity of 1° HS3 such that it is now less intensive than 2° HS3 .
Finally , mutating both GATA sites ( H3M6 ) or both GATA sites and the NF-E2 site ( H3M7 ) results in the complete loss of 1° HS3 .

Mutations used to evaluate the roles of NF-E2 and GATA binding elements in HS2 and HS3 formation .
Mutations were introduced into plasmids pAHS2 and pAHS3 by site-directed mutagenesis .
HS2 contains tandem NF-E2 sites and tandem , inverted GATA binding sites .
HS3 contains two sets of tandem , inverted GATA binding sites located ~50 and ~110 bp 5 '' of the NF-E2 site .
presence of an artifactual band .
This band is present in the ' O ' DNase I lane and does not change with increasing DNase I concentration .
As with the single mutations , 2° HS3 does not appear to be effected by any of the combined mutations .
These results indicate that , just as for HS4 and HS $ 2 , NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA sites are necessary for the formation of 1° HS3 .
The distal tandem GATA sites appear to be more important for HS3 formation than the proximal GATA sites .
Local chromatin structure of HS2 and HS3 The finding of conserved NF-E2 and GATA elements which are required for local chromatin reorganization within each LCR HS suggests that there may also be a common underlying structure within each HS region .
To investigate this possibility we next examined the nucleosomal structure of HS2 and HS3 .
These experiments utilized DNase I , which preferentially digests nuclear DNA in regions of disrupted or displaced nucleosomes , and micrococcal nuclease ( MNase ) , which preferentially cuts linker DNA between nucleosomes , as probes of local chromatin structure ( 21 ) .
Using these techniques the locations of specific regions of nuclease hypersensitivity and the positions of individual nucleosomes can be determined .
Our previous mapping studies of LCR HS4 demonstrated that this HS is composed of an intense central band of DNase I sensitivity covering ~200 bp ( 14,23 ) .
This central area of sensitivity is flanked by less intense DNase I HS bands .
MNase analysis of HS4 demonstrated that in erythroid cells a single nucleosome was disrupted or displaced from the central region of the DNase I HS and that nucleosomes formed a positioned array spanning several hundred base pairs ( 14 ) .
The HS4 HSFE is located near the 5° boundary of the region of open chromatin which closely corresponds to the functional core of HS4 when analyzed for its ability to direct copy number-dependent expression in transgenic mice ( 15 ) .
To determine whether the local chromatin structures of HS2 and HS3 are similarly organized , we performed DNase I and MNase mapping experiments on these two HSs .
The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 6 .
Results for HS2 show that , similar to HS4 , a broad intense central band is formed with DNase digestion ( Fig .
6A ) .
Flanking bands of lesser intensity are also seen , indicating that chromatin structure is altered over several hundred base pairs .
These HSs are indicated by brackets and also shown schematically .
Mapping the boundaries of the central domain of DNase I hypersensitivity reveals an ~270 bp region of open chromatin structure .
Nucleosomal mapping studies using MNase indicate nucleosomal disruption or displacement directly over the central core region of H $ 2 .
This is best seen at the highest MNase concentration , where a broadening of the band which overlies the DNase I HS occurs .
The region of maximal MNase digestion is , however , located one internucleo-somal space 5 '' of the maximal DNase I cutting site .
These results are summarized schematically .
This analysis indicates that HS2 is structurally similar to LCR HS4 at the nucleosomal level by several criteria .
In both HSs a single area of intense DNase I sensitivity is flanked by areas of less intense sensitivity .
The central band of both HSs corresponds to the apparent disruption or displacement of a single nucleosome .
Nucleosomes appear in a positioned array over several hundred base pairs .
In both HS2 and HS4 the NF-E2 and tandem GATA sites are located near the 5 ' boundary of the region of open chromatin structure .
Perhaps most significantly , while protein binding sites are present over several hundred base pairs near each HS , the central region of DNase -sensitive chromatin structure closely corresponds to the functional core region of HS $ 2 when analyzed for its ability to direct copy number-dependent expression in transgenic mice and high level expression in MEL cells ( 16,33 ) .
Also shown is the region where the binding of proteins has been characterized ( 16 ) .

Several DNase I HSs are formed within each construct .
These include HS2 , the test HS in these experiments , 1° HS $ 3 , 2° HS3 and the neo®-associated HS , the positive controls for these experiments .
The expected location of HS2 is shown by the open arrow .

When a similar analysis is applied to HS3 we see a different picture ( Fig .
6B ) .
We have previously shown that the 1.9 kb HindIII fragment contains three distinct DNase I HSs ( 14,17 ) .
The originally identified HS3 ( 1° HS3 ) is found at the 3'-end of this fragment and is actually composed of two HSs .
The characteristic 'super ' or 'major ' DNase I HS is flanked by a less intense HS at its 5 '' boundary ( blots in Fig .
4 ) .
Also contained in this HS3 fragment is another less intense DNase I HS which we have referred to as 2° HS3 .
This HS is located near the 5 ' boundary of the fragment .
Mapping of the locations of the 1° HS3 HS bands is shown in Figure 6B .
Here the parental band is the 1.9 kb HindIII HS $ 3 fragment .
The locations of the two 1° HS3 HSs are indicated by brackets .
The locations of these individual DNase I HSs are also shown schematically in Figure 6B .
Because 2° HS3 is located near the 3 '' -end of the HindIII fragment it was not visualized in this experiment .
The location of the HS was therefore determined by analysis of blots from Figure 4 .
Nucleosomal mapping studies of the HS3 region show a more complex pattern than was seen for HSs 2 or 4 .
This analysis shows three relatively intense bands .
The most 3 '' band , located at the top of the blot , corresponds to the position of maximal DNase I sensitivity .
As for HS2 , the maximal MNase bands do not correspond to the maximal DNase I HS area .
The mapping of nucleosomes in the HS3 region is also shown schematically in Figure 6B .

The DNase I HS also lies near the center of the recently characterized region of phylogenetic footprinting and associated in vitro protein binding sites ( protein binding cluster , Fig .
6B ) which extends over 1400 bp and includes ~90 DNA-protein interaction sites ( 35 ) .
DISCUSSION Our experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA binding elements found in each f-globin LCR HS core region are necessary for the formation of the HSs .
Our results indicate that , just as for HS4 , mutation of these sites within HS2 and HS3 causes a marked reduction in the DNase I sensitivity of the HSs .
These changes are most dramatic when both the NF-E2 and GATA binding motifs are mutated .
Our results support the conclusion that the evolutionarily conserved NF-E2 and tandem inverted GATA sites found in each of the human LCR functional core regions play a critical and similar role in the formation of the individual HSs .
The relationship between -globin LCR chromatin structure and function Our experiments are based on the idea that the combination of an NF-E2 site and tandem , inverted GATA sites comprises a conserved element which is necessary for establishing the normal H3M4 H3M5 NF-E2 GATA x2 NF-E2 GATA x 2 M 0 -- - » M 0 6.6 ® 4.4 « < P N a ciss 2.3 as 4 = 20 ® UD « g 29H53 1.4 14 0.87 wa < G HS4 0.56 a H3M6 H3M7Z NF-E2 GATA x 2 NF-E2 GATA x 2 Ma -- P » M Q -- « ggg== amnll .

A related hypothesis is that the formation of the LCR HS structures is necessary for LCR function .
Since the initial description of the -globin LCR , studies of LCR function have been performed in a variety of experimental contexts .
If formation of HS chromatin structures is necessary for LCR function , then these studies should demonstrate the importance of the same NF-E2 and GATA binding sites in LCR function .
Studies aimed at defining the minimal LCR elements necessary for high level and position-independent expression of linked globin genes have been performed for HSs 2 , 3 and 4 .
As shown in Figure 6 , these minimal elements correspond closely to the open chromatin domains of HS2 and HS3 and contain the NF-E2 and GATA binding sequences ( 16,17,33,34 ) .
Similar results were found for HS4 ( 15 ) .
One exception to this conclusion is that the 'minimal ' core of HS3 , as defined by Philipsen et al. , does not encompass the NF-E2 site of HS3 ( 17 ) .
However , while this core region is able to direct copy number-dependent expression in multi-copy transgenic mice , gene expression levels are only ~50 % of those observed with the full 1.9 kb HindIII HS3 fragment .
Also , the NF-E2 site is footprinted in vivo ( 36 ) and is conserved between species ( 14,35 ) .
In vivo footprinting of the H83 region also shows binding to both tandem GATA motifs ( 36 ) .
The same study also demonstrated in vivo binding to the tandem GATA element of HS2 .
Functional studies examining the effects of mutating individual binding sites within HS2 and HS3 have also been performed .

24 - 5689 Philipsen and colleagues found that a 98 bp fragment of HS3 extending from the 5 '' set of tandem GATA sites through the 3 '' set of tandem GATA sites was able to confer copy number-dependent expression in transgenic mice .
These are the same sites mutated in the current study .
Deletion of either of these sets of tandem GATA sites from their test construct resulted in markedly decreased expression and loss of copy number dependence ( 32 ) .
Specific mutation of the tandem NF-E2 elements of HS2 resulted in a 4-fold decrease in average expression when assayed as stable integrants in MEL cells ( 17 ) .
Mutation of these sites in transient assays results in the complete loss of HS2 enhancer activity ( 29 ) .
Deletion of the tandem NF-E2 sites in the context of a 1.9 kb HS2 fragment in transgenic mice resulted in a 20-fold decrease in expression levels but copy number dependence was maintained ( 33 ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that the specific NF-E2 and tandem GATA sites we have studied in HSs 2 , 3 and 4 are not only required for the formation of the native chromatin structures of the HSs , but are also important for the functional activities of the LCR .
Mechanism of LCR HS formation Numerous studies have shown that the DNase I HSs associated with the f } -globin LCR are erythroid specific ( 5-7 ) .
Other studies have shown that the initial formation of the HSs may occur very early in erythroid differentiation or even prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation ( 37,38 ) .
Our own experiments , as well as those of Boyes and Felsenfeld on the formation of the chicken -globin enhancer HS , show that even after NF-E2 and GATA sites are mutated , a very weak HS often persists ( 14,20 ) .
These investigators used a quantitative restriction endonuclease assay of HS formation to show that the weak HS which forms in the absence of NF-E2 and/or GATA sites is due to a decrease in the proportion of HS regions which , within a cell population , are in a DNase -hypersensitive conformation ( 20 ) .
Thus , binding of as yet unspecified factors may result in the initial remodeling of a small proportion of HS regions .
The subsequent binding of NF-E2 and GATA factors would then stabilize this structure and shift the equilibrium from the nuclease-insensitive to the nuclease-sensitive conformations of the HS .
Supporting this model are recent unpublished results from our laboratory suggesting that the NF-E2 and tandem , inverted GATA sites are , on their own , insufficient for HS formation in nuclear chromatin .
While we have largely focused on the cis-acting sequences necessary for LCR HS formation , the trans-acting factors which mediate these structural changes are also relevant .
In MEL cells , GATA-1 is the only readily detectable GATA family member ( 39,40 ) .
This implies that GATA-1 is able to mediate HS formation .
Other GATA proteins such as GATA-2 , which is expressed earlier in erythroid differentiation , may also be able to participate in LCR HS formation ( 41 ) .
NF-E2 and , to a lesser extent , AP-1 comprise the NF-E2 consensus sequence binding activity in MEL cells ( 42 ) .
Mutation of DNA bases required for NF-E2 binding , but not for AP-1 binding , within the HS $ 4 core resulted in decreased DNase I sensitivity ( 14 ) .
These results suggest that NF-E2 is also a necessary trans-acting factor for full LCR HS formation .
Supporting this conclusion are experiments performed by Armstrong and Emerson in a cell-free system , which demonstrated the ability of NF-E2 to disrupt local nucleosomal structure , and by Gong et al. , which showed that the tandem NF-E2 sites of HS2 were necessary for HS formation on 5690 Nucleic Acids Research , 1998 , Vol .

an Epstein-Barr-derived minichromosome in K562 cells ( 43,44 ) .
MEL cells lacking NF-E2 have been shown to form LCR HSs ( 45 ) .
However , our results and those of the Felsenfeld laboratory predict that the loss of NF-E2 would not abolish the HS , but would result only in a decrease in its DNase I sensitivity ( 14,20 ) .
Factors interacting with the tandem GATA binding elements appear to play a special role in LCR HS formation .
For example , while ~90 in vitro DNA-protein interactions have been identified within or near the HS3 core region ( 35 ) , the mutation of only the 3 '' set of tandem GATA sites results in the near complete loss of the HS .
Similar results were seen in our studies of HSs 2 and 4 .
The apposition of the tandem , inverted GATA binding elements may result in a unique interaction between GATA binding proteins which stabilizes the chromatin structure of the HS .
This potential structural role of GATA proteins is distinct from their previously described transcriptional functions ( 46 ) and raises the possibility that one of the key functions of GATA-1 may be the maintenance of an open or active chromatin structure surrounding erythroid-specific gene loci .
The active elements of the LCR have several features in common ( i.e .
they are contained within developmentally stable , erythroid-specific DNase I HSs , they confer copy number-dependent expression in multi-copy transgenic mice and they are evolutionarily conserved ) .
Despite these functional similarities , little structural similarity has been found between the HSs , other than the observation that they contain clusters of similar DNA binding factors ( 47,48 ) .
Our finding of evolutionarily conserved , similarly arranged NF-E2 and GATA binding elements within HSs 2 , 3 and 4 which appear to serve the common function of tissue-specific local chromatin structure reorganization raises two possibilities .
The first is that the active elements of the LCR may be related by more than just the fact that they contain clusters of similar frans-factor binding sites .
A common , multi-protein structure may be formed at the center of each LCR element .
Potential functions of this structure include mediating interactions between individual HS elements ( as in the holocomplex model of LCR function ) or between the HS elements and distant globin gene promoters .
Another potential function of the common structure might be to open local chromatin to allow assembly of the full complement of DNA binding factors necessary for LCR function .
Our findings also raise the possibility that the LCR HSs may share a common evolutionary heritage .
Just as the individual globin genes arose by gene duplication and subsequent divergence , the LCR HSs may also have arisen from a common 'ancestor ' regulatory element , followed by evolutionary divergence of protein binding sites around the central core region , leading to different functional roles for each HS .
