} , Renate Wagnert , and William B. Pratt§ From the Departments of { Internal Medicine and §Pharmacology , The University of Michigan School of Medicine , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 Although glucocorticoids are not cytolytic for and do not inhibit the growth of the IM-9 line of cultured human lymphoblasts , these cells have a high steroid-binding capacity .
We have used IM-9 cells in order to examine whether unoccupied glucocorticoid receptors are inactivated and activated in intact cells .
When IM-9 cells are incubated in glucose-free medium in a nitrogen atmosphere , both their ability to bind triamcinolone acetonide and their ATP levels decline and , when glucose and oxgen are reintroduced , ATP levels and receptor activity return .
The specific glucocorticoid-binding activity of cytosol prepared from cells exposed to various degrees of energy limitation is directly correlated with the ATP content .
Receptor activation in intact cells is rapid and independent of protein synthe-sis .
Cytosol prepared from inactivated cells can not be activated by addition of ATP .
The inactivation of glucocorticoid receptors that occurs when cytosol from normal IM-9 cells is incubated at 25°C is inhibited by molybdate , vanadate , fluoride , ATP , and several other nucleotides .
The experiments with intact human lymphoblasts suggest that assays of specific glucocorticoid-binding capacity do not necessarily reflect the cellular content of receptor protein .
Several years ago , Munck and Brinck-Johnsen ( 1 ) demonstrated that the specific binding observed in intact rat thymic lymphocytes incubated with radiolabeled cortisol can be reduced by exposing the cells to nitrogen and restored by returning them to an oxygen atmosphere .
The alterations in specific binding were accompanied by similar changes in ATP .
Munck et al .
( 2 ) subsequently proposed that ATP might be required to maintain glucocorticoid receptors in a steroid-binding form ( 2 ) .
Other more indirect observations made in intact cells exposed to metabolic inhibitors support this hypothesis ( 3-6 ) .
We have recently presented several types of evidence in support of the proposal that unoccupied glucocorticoid receptors under cell-free conditions are inactivated by a dephos-phorylation process ( 7-9 ) .
We have shown that inactivated receptors in cytosols prepared from mouse L-cells or rat thymic lymphocytes can be reactivated to the steroid-binding * This investigation was supported by a grant from the Children 's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan and by Grant CA-16041 awarded by the National Cancer Institute .

form by a process that utilizes ATP and a heat stable factor ( 10-12 ) .
Activation of the receptor by phosphorylation has not yet been directly demonstrated , and it is not known if the phosphorylated moiety is the steroid-binding protein itself or if some other component required for steroid-binding activity is activated and inactivated by a phosphorylation-dephos-phorylation mechanism .
It is important to note that we are using the term `` activation '' throughout this paper to describe the process whereby the receptor is converted from a nonbinding form to a form that binds steroids .
This is different from the use of the term `` activation '' to describe the process whereby the steroid-bound receptor is converted to a form that binds to nuclei , DNA cellulose , etc .
We use the term `` transformation '' to describe this latter process .
The possibility exists that receptors may be able to be switched on and off in a rapid and reversible manner .
Such a process could be an important mechanism for regulating the ability of the cell to respond to steroids .
If the concept is correct , one should be able to demonstrate that receptors can be inactivated and reactivated in the intact cell in the absence of hormone .
Bell and Munck ( 13 ) have published an experiment performed with rat thymic lymphocytes suggesting this is possible .
In other experiments , intact cells were incubated in the presence of radiolabeled steroid ( 1-4 , 6 ) and the results are subject to a variety of interpretations as the steroid : receptor complex is able to cycle into and out of the nucleus .
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that unoccupied glucocorticoid receptors can be readily inactivated and activated in intact cells .
Activation is rapid , independent of protein synthesis , and directly correlated to cellular ATP content .
As variation in receptor activity could explain differences in responses observed clinically with steroid therapy , we have chosen cultured lymphoblasts of human origin for the experimental system .

434 Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation and Inactivation yeast , and hexokinase ( EC 2.7.1.1 ) from yeast were from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals , Indianapolis .
Modified minimal essential medium , RPMI 1640 , and the same medium without glucose were obtained from Grand Island Biological Co. , Grand Island , N.Y. Fetal calf serum ( not heat inactivated ) was from Kansas City Biologicals , Kansas City , Kansas .
All other materials were reagent grade .
Methods Cell Lines and Culture-The Raji , EB-3 , and Jijoye lines of Burkitt lymphoma were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and the P ; J line was provided by Dr. Charles Shipman of the Department of Oral Biology at the University of Michigan Dental School .
The IM-9 cell line was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Jesse Roth at the National Institutes of Health .
The Burkitt and the IM-9 ( derived from a patient with multiple myeloma ) are established human lymphoblastoid cell lines of the bone marrow-derived ( B-cell ) type ( 14 ) .
The P ; J and IM-9 cell lines have a doubling time of 15 to 18 h during the log phase of growth and the Raji , EB-3 , and Jjoye lines double in about 24 h. The IM-9 line was demonstrated to contain appropriate isoenzyme markers ( lactic dehydrogenase , EC 1.1.1.27 ; malic dehydrogenase , EC 1.1.1.37 ; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , EC 1.1.1.49 ; triosephosphate isomerase , EC 5.3.1.1 ; glyoxalase I , EC 4.4.1.5 ; and phosphoglucomutase , EC 2.7.5.1 ) of human origin in the laboratory of Dr. Harvey Mohrenweiser , in the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Michigan Medical School ( 15 ) .
The cell lines were maintained in stationary suspension culture at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum , 100 units/ml of sodium penicillin G , and 100 ug/ml of streptomycin .
The effect of glucocorticoid on cell growth and viability was assayed in triplicate 10-ml cultures in 30-ml plastic Falcon flasks .
Cells were counted with a Coulter counter and viability was determined by erythrocin B dye exclusion ( 16 ) .
For experiments involving steroid-receptor assays , 100- or 200-ml cultures were grown in one-liter Blake bottles ( Corning Glass Works ) equilibrated with 5 % CO ; in air and harvested by low speed centrifugation during the log phase of growth .
Cell Fractionation and Steroid-binding Assay-IM-9 cells were ruptured by suspension in 1.5 volumes of hypotonic buffer ( 10 mm Tris , pH 7.35 , and 0.1 mm EDTA ) and Dounce homogenization .
Complete cell rupture ( verified by microscopic examination ) is achieved with this procedure .
In those experiments where receptor inactivation was examined in cytosol at 25°C , cells were ruptured in Tris buffer that was adjusted to pH 7.35 at that temperature .
In all other experiments , the Tris was pH adjusted at 0°C .
The ruptured cell suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 27,000 x g and the resulting supernatant was recentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 x g. Supernatants , 100,000 x g , were also prepared from rat liver homogenized in 10 mm Hepes buffer as previously described ( 7 ) .
All fractionation procedures were carried out at 0-4°C .
The resulting cytosol preparation was quick frozen , stored at -70°C as previously described ( 10 ) , and thawed just prior to use by warming at 20°C .
The liquid was removed and transferred to an ice bath as thawing took place .
Incubations containing cytosol ( 50 to 90 % by volume ) and other additions were prepared as noted in the legends to the figures and tables .
Steroid-binding capacity was assayed by removing 0.36-ml aliquots of the incubation mix and incubating them for 2 h at 0°C in a total volume of 0.40 ral with 50 nm [ *H ] triamcinolone acetonide in the presence of either a 1000-fold excess of nonradioactive dexamethasone or vehicle as previously described .
This concentration of [ ' H Itriamcinolone acetonide is 5 times the concentration required to saturate specific binding sites on long term incubation at 0°C ( Fig .
7 ) and , at this high steroid concentration , binding sites are saturated in 2 h ( 17 ) .
Bound steroid was separated from free material by chroma-tography on small columns of Sephadex G-25 and bound radioactivity was assayed as described before ( 18 ) .
The specific binding capacity represents the bound counts per min measured in the absence of dexamethasone minus that measured in the presence of the competing steroid .
All binding values presented in this paper represent the average of duplicate determinations .
Experiments Involving Inhibition of Metabolism of Intact Cells-IM-9 cells were harvested from log phase cultures by low speed centrifugation and resuspended at 37°C in glucose-free RPMI 1640 ( Roswell Park Memorial Institute ) medium containing 4.5 g liter of bovine serum albumin at a cell concentration of 2 to 4 X 10° cells/ml .
The 100-ml cultures in Blake bottles were either continuously perfused by passing 95 % nitrogen , 5 % CO ; over the surface of the culture medium at a rate of 1 liter/min/culture or perfused for 3 min with 5 % CO ; and air and sealed .
In some experiments , the oxygen tension and pH of the culture medium was determined with an International IL 435 313 blood gas analyzer and the oxygen concentration in the gas phase was determined with a Perkin-Elmer respiratory mass spectrometer .
Cultures were maintained at 37°C until , at various times as indicated , they were rapidly poured into a 250-ml !
centrifuge bottle and immediately cooled by immersion into a dry ice/acetone bath .
After rapid cooling , they were placed in an ice bath and all subsequent procedures were carried out at 0°C .
Each Blake bottle was rinsed once with 20 mi of iced normal saline and the wash was added to the cooled cell suspension .
Twenty-five milliliters of each culture was removed for ATP assay as described below and che remaining 95 ml was utilized for assay of glucocorticoid-binding capacity .
This portion was centrifuged at low speed , in a graduated conical centrifuge tube .
Two milliliters of the hypotonic buffer was added to each 0.4- to 0.6-ml packed cell pellet and was either ruptured and assayed for binding immediately or frozen at -~70°C for subsequent binding assay .
There was no loss of binding capacity over 2 weeks of storage at -70°C .
After suspension in hypotonic buffer or after rapid thawing as described above , cells were homogenized with several strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 25,000 x g. Specific binding capacity was determined in duplicate 0.4-ml samples of this 27,000 x g supernatant rather than in a high speed ( 100,000 x g ) cytosol .
Aliquots of each 27,000 x g supernatant were assayed for protein content according to the method of Oyama and Eagle ( 19 ) , using bovine serum albumin ( Sigma , Fraction V ) as a reference standard .
Incorporation of [ *H ] leucine into acid-insoluble form was assayed by adding 5 Ci of the labeled amino acid/ml of suspension of IM-9 cells ( 2 x 10° cells/ml in 30-ml suspensions ) in RPMI medium which contains 0.4 mM nonradioactive leucine .
Cycloheximide was added in 0.01 volume of aqueous solution to a final concentration of 5 ug/ml .
Aliquots ( 2.0 ml ) of triplicate cell suspensions were removed , precipitated with cold 10 % trichloroacetic acid , washed , filtered , and assayed for radioactivity as described previously ( 20 ) .
ATP Assays-After removing an aliquot for determining cell count , the 25-ral cell suspensions were centrifuged at low speed and the pellet was resuspended in 0.4 to 0.6 ml of 0.6 M perchloric acid , mixed , and centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 15 min .
The supernatant was neutralized with 2 M potassium carbonate , incubated at 0°C for 30 min , centrifuged again for 5 min , and the supernatant was stored at -70°C .
We have found that the luciferin-luciferase assay for ATP which we have previously used with cytosols prepared from mouse L-cells ( 11 ) does not give reliable results with cytosol prepared from IM-9 cells ; consequently we have assayed ATP using an enzyme assay coupled to the fluorometric measurement of reduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotides ( 21 ) as described by Marks and Medzihradsky ( 22 ) .
Neutralized perchlorate supernatant ( 5 to 20 ul ) was added to a reaction mixture ( final volume , 1.0 ml ) containing a final concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer ( pH 7.5 ) , 1 mm MgCl » , 0.05 my NADP* , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol , 0.1 mm glucose , 0.02 % bovine serum albumin , 0.1 ug/ml of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 1 ug/ml of hexokinase .
NADPH was assayed in a fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 470 nm , respectively .
Standard curves were run with each assay and ATP content was expressed as nanomoles of ATP/10° cells .
RESULTS In order to carry out the intact cell experiments to be reported here , we required a source of cells that would be available in large amounts , that could be suspended at high density and maintain viability over several hours , and that contain a high receptor activity .
Therefore , we have examined several lines of human B lymphocytes maintained in continuous culture for their glucocorticoid sensitivity in terms of growth inhibition and for their ability to bind radiolabeled triamcinolone acetonide in a stereospecific manner .
As shown in Table I , neither the Burkitt nor the IM-9 cells had any substantial cytolytic response to glucocorticoid as assayed by dye exclusion viability .
Indeed , only one of the lines , Burkitt EB-3 cells , demonstrated significant growth inhibition .
Cytosols prepared from Burkitt cells had low specific binding activity that could not be substantially enhanced by dithiothreitol and molybdate ( Table I ) .
In contrast , the IM-9 cells have a high glucocorticoid binding capacity that is about 4 times that reported for similar cytosols prepared from the very sensitive C7 subclone of the CEM human lympho-blast line ( 23 ) .
Although the IM-9 cells demonstrate no growth 436 Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation and Inactivation I Effect of glucocorticoid on the growth and viability of cultured human B lymphocytes and specific binding of cytosol preparations Replicate cultures of the indicated lines of cultured human lymphocytes were set up at 5 x 10° cells/ml and incubated for 5 days in the presence of 0.1 um triamcinolone acetonide ( Burkitt cells ) , 10 uM dexamethasone ( IM-9 ) , or ethanol vehicle .
After 5 days , cells were counted in a Coulter Counter and erythrocin B dye exclusion indices were determined ( per cent values expressed in parentheses ) .
Each cell count represents the mean and standard deviation of three replicate cultures .
Specific binding capacity was assayed in aliquots of 100,000 Cell count and viability Cell line Control With steroid cells/ml x 10~° Burkitt PJ 2.28 + 0.01 2.30 + 0.02 ( 92 ) ( 90 ) Burkitt Raji 1.67 + 0.06 1.31 + 0.03 ( 98 ) ( 96 ) Burkitt EB-3 1.38 + 0.01 0.64 + 0.01 ( 97 ) ( 95 ) Burkitt Jijoye 1.33 + 0.07 1.39 + 0.07 ( 96 ) ( 95 ) IM-9 2.06 + 0.04 2.19 + 0.08 ( 87 ) ( 83 ) inhibition with glucocorticoids , their high binding capacity is required for the intact cell studies using our techniques .
When IM-9 cells are grown in 200-ml cultures ( 6-liter lots were grown in this fashion so that large amounts of cells would be available for preparation of 100,000 x g cytosol utilized in the experiments of Figs .
7 to 11 and Tables II and III ) , the binding capacity is somewhat lower than the 1,530 fmol/mg of protein presented in Table I .
For example , the average binding capacity presented in the 100,000 x g supernatants utilized in the experiments to be presented later is about 1,250 fmol/mg of protein .
From experiments where we have determined the amount of triamcinolone acetonide bound of protein in the 27,000 x g supernatant prepared from a known number of cells , we can calculate that there are about 30,000 specific binding sites/cell .
This is similar to the number of binding sites we have calculated for L929 mouse fibroblasts growing in suspension culture ( 24 ) .
Alteration of Receptor Activity in Intact Cells-When IM-9 cells suspended in growth medium are perfused with nitrogen , the oxygen tension of the medium drops rapidly ( Fig .
1A ) but there is only a minimal effect on cellular ATP content over the course of 3 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
It is clear from the data of Fig .
1B that cells must be deprived of both glucose and oxygen in order for the ATP content to be lowered rapidly .
As shown in Fig .
24 , cells suspended in glucose-free medium in a nitrogen atmosphere lose their ability to bind glucocorticoids .
It should be noted that the cells are not being exposed to steroids during the inactivation process .
Rather , the 27,000 x g supernatant is being prepared from cells that have been exposed to energy-limiting conditions for various periods of time and it is then incubated with [ °H Jtriamcinolone acetonide at 0°C to assay binding capacity , Thus , the decrease in binding represents inactivation or degradation of unoccupied receptor .
The loss of binding capacity coincides roughly with the decrease in ATP content .
The binding capacity of cells incubated in the presence of glucose and air is compared with that of cells incubated under energy-limiting conditions in Fig .
2B .
In the presence of glucose and oxygen , the specific binding capacity can be maintained for several hours .
Addition of 3 mm sodium molybdate to the suspension medium does not affect either the steady state binding capacity or the rate of loss under metabolic restriction .

Each binding value for cytosol alone represents the average of at least four assays from two or more cytosol preparations expressed as femtomoles of [ °H Itriamcinolone acetonide bound specifically per mg of protein + the standard deviation .
In each case , binding assays were also performed in the presence of 2 mM dithiothreitol and 10 mm sodium molybdate and those values for Burkitt cells represent the average of duplicate determinations .

Effect of hypoxia and the presence or absence of glucose on IM-9 cell ATP content .
A , IM-9 cell cultures were continuously perfused with an atmosphere of 95 % nitrogen , 5 % CO » .
At the indicated times , samples of the medium ( @ ) and the gas phase ( OQ ) were removed with a sealed syringe and assayed for oxygen content as described under `` Methods . ''
B , IM-9 cells were harvested from culture and suspended in RPMI medium without glucose , the suspension was divided into several portions , and incubated at 37°C under the following conditions : @ , plus glucose in an atmosphere of air ; O , plus glucose in an atmosphere of nitrogen ; A , minus glucose in air ; A , minus glucose in nitrogen .
At the indicated times , samples of cell suspension were removed and assayed for ATP .
ATP content represents the mean of values determined from three cell suspensions expressed as nanomoles of ATP/10° cells and the error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean .
As shown in Fig .
3 , when glucose is added to cells that have been exposed to metabolic restriction and the cells are returned to an air atmosphere , both specific binding capacity and ATP levels rise .
The extent of reactivation of the binding capacity decreases with time of incubation under nitrogen with glucose-free conditions .
Very little reactivation is obtained after 3 h , whereas complete restoration is obtained if glucose and oxygen are reintroduced at 90 min or before .
It is difficult to determine the rate at which reactivation occurs .
In the experiment in Fig .
4 , maximum restoration of both ATP and binding capacity were obtained within 10 min .
The restoration of binding capacity occurs even if protein synthesis is blocked by cycloheximide ( Fig .

Although there is no relationship between receptor activity and protein synthesis over the short time of these experiments , the relationship between specific binding capacity and ATP is clear ( Fig .

The data for Fig .
6 are collected from several experiments where we assayed both ATP and binding capacity in the same cell suspensions after various times of incubation under energy-limiting conditions , after similar preincubation followed by reactivation , and after control incubation for up to 4 h in the presence of glucose and air .
The binding capacity of the cell is related to the ATP content up to an ATP level of 2 to 3 nmol/10° cells , at which point no further increase in binding occurs .
It should be noted that the binding capacity for these crude 27,000 x g supernatants is maximum at 500 to 600 fmol/mg of protein whereas somewhat higher values will be presented for high speed ( 100,000 x g ) supernatants which contain less protein .

Binding of triamcinolone acetonide in IM-9 cytosol as a function of steroid concentration .
Incubations ( 0.5 mi ) containing 100,000 x g IM-9 cell supernatant and various concentrations of radioactive triamcinolone acetonide in the presence of vehicle or nonradioactive dexamethasone were maintained for 20 h at 0°C in the presence or absence of 10 mM sodium molybdate .
At the end of the incubation , the amount of bound radioactivity in each sample was assayed .
The results are expressed as femtomoles of steroid bound/ mg of protein versus the free concentration of the radioactive steroid .

Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation and Inactivation were incubated for 20 h with various concentrations of radiolabeled triamcinolone acetonide in the presence or absence of 10 mm sodium molybdate and binding was assayed .
The binding curve for the molybdate-containing cytosol is the same as that for the control .
The apparent dissociation constants calculated from the slopes of the Scatchard plots are 3.7 nM and 3.4 nm for the control and molybdate-containing samples , respectively .
The rate at which glucocorticoids achieve binding equilibrium at 0°C is very slow , with reported rate constants of association being in the range of 3 to 9 x 10° ~ ' min~ ' ( 13 , 18 ) .
Unoccupied glucocorticoid receptors are rapidly inactivated at 0°C in cytosols prepared from several tissue sources and they are markedly stabilized when bound by potent ligands like triamcinolone acetonide ( 13 , 18 , 25 ) .
As pointed out both by Bell and Munck ( 13 ) and by ourselves ( 18 , 26 ) , the determination of dissociation constants by the approach used in the experiment of Fig .
7 is complicated by the fact that the unoccupied receptor is being inactivated during the time that the slow binding reaction is taking place .
In cytosol from rat thymic lymphocytes , for example , the rate of receptor inactivation is fast enough to significantly alter the binding curve , particularly at low receptor occupancy , and Scatchard plots of the binding may not yield a valid estimation of the dissociation constant ( 13 , 18 , 26 ) .
The experiment of Fig .
8 was carried out to show that the data of Fig .
7 represent a good approximation of equilibrium binding values and thus yield a valid Kp .
Aliquots of cytosol were incubated with a concentration of triamcinolone acetonide sufficient to occupy about 20 % of the binding sites .
Maximum binding is achieved at 10 to 20 h and it declines very slowly thereafter .

Demonstration of steady state binding at partial receptor occupancy .
Aliquots of a 100,000 x g IM-9 cell supernatant containing 10 mM sodium molybdate ( A ) or vehicle ( @ ) were incubated ( with and without nonradioactive competing dexamethasone ) at 0°C with a concentration of [ *H triamcinolone acetonide sufficient to occupy approximately 20 % of the specific binding sites at equilib-rium .
At the indicated times , the specific binding of triamcinolone acetonide was determined on duplicate samples .
The inset shows the same binding time course drawn as a solid line and binding values obtained by incubating the supernatant with a concentration of [ *H Itriamcinolone acetonide ( 3 X 10~° M ) that is well beyond that required to yield occupancy of all specific binding sites .
The initial amount of specific binding was assayed by adding the labeled steroid at zero time and assaying at 9 h. Free receptor in equilibrium with the bound steroid was assayed by adding the labeled steroid ( 3 x 10~° M ) to molybdate-containing or control samples that had been incubated for 72 h with the low , subsaturating concentration of labeled ligand and assaying binding 8 h later ( solid lines to dots ) .
The dashed lines give an approximation of the rate of inactivation of the specific binding capacity of the free receptor at 0°C in the presence and absence of molybdate .
Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation and Inactivation unbound ) receptor can be demonstrated even after 72 h at 0°C .
The free receptor is very stable , having a / , » of about 80 h at 0°C , and it is even more stable in the presence of molybdate .
If the temperature of the cytosol is raised to 25°C , the binding capacity is rapidly lost ( Fig .
9 ) .
The rate of receptor inactivation is not affected by the presence of dithiothreitol but it is slowed tremendously by 10 mm molybdate ( Fig .
9 and Table I ) .
Vanadate , another Group 6A transition metal oxide , has been shown to inhibit transformation of the avian progesterone -receptor complex to the DNA-binding state ( 27 ) and , as shown in Fig .
10 , it inhibits inactivation of unbound glucocorticoid receptors .
Although vanadate is somewhat more potent than molybdate at low concentrations , its stabilizing effect actually decreases when it is present at 1 mM and higher .
The decrease in efficacy at higher concentrations is observed in rat liver as well as human lymphocyte cytosol and in both Tris and Hepes buffers .
As shown in Table II , fluoride partially inhibits receptor inactivation but glucose 1-phosphate , which inhibits inactivation of both mouse fibroblast and rat liver receptors ( 7 ) , is ineffective .
ATP also inhibits the inactivation of cytosol-bind-ing capacity .
A maximum of about 50 % inhibition of receptor inactivation is achieved with 3 mm ATP ( Fig .
11 ) .
Although ATP is the best inhibitor of the nucleotides ( Table III ) , GTP , CTP , and UTP are also active .

Inhibition of inactivation of unoccupied receptor by molybdate and vanadate .
Aliquots of 100,000 x g supernatant prepared from IM-9 cells ( A ) or rat liver ( B ) were incubated for 2 h at 25°C in the presence of vehicle ( & ) , or various concentrations of sodium molybdate ( @ ) or sodium metavanadate ( 0 ) .
After 2 h , the specific binding capacity was assayed at 0°C as described under `` Methods . ''
The results are expressed as a per cent of the binding capacity present at zero time .
The supernatant and all additions were prepared in 10 mm Tris without EDTA in A and in 10 mm Hepes buffer without EDTA in B. TasLE II Effect of known glucocorticoid receptor stabilizing compounds on inactivation of the binding capacity of IM-9 cytosol IM-9 cytosol ( 100,000 x g supernatant ) was incubated for 2 h at 25°C , with 2 mm dithiothreitol , 100 mM sodium fluoride , I0 mm sodium molybdate , 5 mM glucose 1-phosphate , or 1 mm ATP .
Specific binding capacity was assayed at time zero and after 2 h. Each value represents the average of duplicate determinations expressed as femtomoles of triamcinolone acetonide bound specifically/mg of protein .

We have tried all of the conditions that we have reported in the other systems ( 11 , 12 ) and have not been able to reactivate either receptors in cytosol prepared from cells that were inactivated by exposure to nitrogen and glucose-free conditions while intact , or receptors in cytosol inactivated by incubation at 25°C as in the experiment of Fig .

Under such conditions , the bound steroid receptor complex is rapidly transformed and associates with the cell nucleus .
The interpretation of binding activity assayed in cytosol prepared from cells incubated in this manner is complicated because of the partitioning between particulate and soluble fractions ( 3 ) .
In the experiments of Figs .
2 to 5 , it is clearly the binding activity of the unbound form of the receptor that is being altered .
There is no specific binding activity in low speed pellets prepared from cells incubated under energy-limiting conditions in the absence of glucocor-ticoid .
In view of the lack of effect of cycloheximide ( Fig .
5 ) , it seems very unlikely that the receptor is being degraded and then resynthesized when glucose and oxygen are reintroduced .
Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation and Inactivation The simplest interpretation of the data is that the receptor is being inactivated as the ATP level drops and reactivated as it rises again .
We do not know the rate of either the inactivation or reactivation process , The rates of receptor inactivation presented in Figs .
2 and 3 may represent the rates at which the ATP levels were lowered under the energy-limiting conditions .
As the decrease in ATP may be rate-limiting , it is possible that receptor inactivation is a rapid process like receptor activation ( Fig .
4 ) .
This would only be seen if the capacity to reactivate could be blocked immediately .
The direct relationship between specific binding capacity and ATP levels shown in Fig .
6 is consistent with the proposal of Munck et al .
( 2 ) that ATP is required to maintain the receptor in a state that can bind steroids .
Although receptor and ATP may vary coincidently , the simplest interpretation is that ATP is in some way involved in receptor activation .
The only way to directly prove this would be to prepare cytosol from cells exposed to energy-limiting conditions and reactivate the receptor in an ATP-dependent manner in the cell-free preparation .
We have not yet been able to do this .
As we have not activated receptor in IM-9 cytosol , we have focused our attention here on the inactivation .
Although the unbound IM-9 receptor is very stable at 0°C ( Fig .
8 ) , it is rapidly inactivated at higher temperatures .
The glucocorticoid-binding activity of rat lung ( 28 ) and thymic lymphocyte ( 5 , 12 ) cytosol is also rapidly inactivated and the receptor in these preparations is significantly stabilized by dithiothreitol .
In contrast , IM-9 cytosol is unaffected by addition of reducing equivalents ( Fig .
9 ) .
Molybdate stabilizes the binding activity of IM-9 cytosol ( Figs .
9 to 11 ) but it does not affect the amount of steroid bound at steady state ( Fig .
7 ) .
Two other transition metal oxyanions , vanadate ( Fig .
10 ) and tungstate , also stabilize the unbound glucocorticoid receptor .
Nishigori and Toft ( 27 ) have shown that vanadate and tungstate inhibit transformation of the progesterone-receptor complex .
We have previously reported that tungstate is a rather poor inhibitor of receptor inactivation in rat liver cytosol ( 29 ) , however , we have repeated the experiment in cytosol prepared with Hepes rather than Tris buffer and find tungstate to be almost as potent as molybdate ( data not shown ) .
Nishigori and Toft ( 27 ) have shown that molybdate inhibition of avian progesterone receptor transformation is highly pH-dependent ( haif-maximal inhibition is achieved with 1 mM molybdate at pH 8.0 and 0.1 mM at ph 7.0 ) , and the very weak stabilization of unbound glucocorticoid receptor that we originally observed with tungstate may reflect a problem with pH .
Given the decreasing effect of vanadate at high concentrations ( Fig .
10 ) , molybdate would seem to be the best transition metal oxyanion for preventing inactivation of unoccupied receptors .
