Burakoff , and Yong-Jiu Jin '' To study the mechanism by which protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) regulate CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation , we investigated the distribution of PTPs in subdomains of plasma membrane .
We report here that the bulk PTP activity associated with T cell membrane is present outside the lipid rafts , as determined by sucrose density gradient sedimentation .
In Jurkat T cells , ~5-10 % of Sre homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP is constitutively associated with plasma membrane , and nearly 50 % of SHP-2 is translocated to plasma membrane after vanadate treatment .
Similar to transmembrane PTP , CD45 , the membrane-associated populations of SHP-1 and SHP-2 are essentially excluded from lipid rafts , where other signaling molecules such as Lek , linker for activation of T cells , and CD3 are enriched .
We further demonstrated that CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates is largely restricted to lipid rafts , unless PTPs are inhibited .
It suggests that a restricted partition of PTPs among membrane subdomains may regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T cell membrane .
To test this hypothesis , we targeted SHP-1 into lipid rafts by using the N-terminal region of Lek ( residues 1-14 ) .
The results indicate that the expression of Lek/SHP-1 chimera inside lipid rafts profoundly inhibits CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 { e , IL-2 generation , and nuclear mobilization of NF-AT .
Collectively , these results suggest that the exclusion of PTPs from lipid rafts may be a mechanism that potentiates TCR/CD3 activation .
The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 166 : 3975-3982. phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activa- tion motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of CD3 subunits ( 1 , 2 ) .
Phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs by Src family kinases leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of ZAP70/Syk family protein kinases , which , in turn , results in the subsequent phosphorylation and complex formation of signaling molecules , including linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) , '' Grb2 , Vav , SH2 domain-containing Leukocyte Protein of 76 kDa ( SLP-76 ) , and murine Sons of Sevenless ( mSOS ) ( 3-7 ) .
This links TCR stimulation to the activation of downstream path-ways , such as mitogen-activated protein kinase , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and phospholipase C-y1 , ( 8 , 9 ) .
Recent studies suggest that the compartmentalization of membrane structure imposed by lipid rafts is essential for TCR-medi-ated signaling ( 10-12 ) .
Lipid rafts have been described as a mobile and dynamic membrane structure with a diameter of 70-300 nm ( 13 ) .
Previous studies that used confocal microscopy have shown that stimulation by TCR , CD2 , or CD3/CD28 induces reorganization and clustering of lipid raft microdomains at the site of en-gagement , which lead to enhanced TCR signaling and a higher and S timulation of the TCR/CD3 complex induces tyrosine Department of Pediatric Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 Received for publication September 19 , 2000 .

Discrete lipid rafts are enriched in molecules involved in signal transduction , such as Sre family kinases , Ras , and G proteins , as well as sphingolipid , cholesterol , and a subset of GPI-linked proteins ( 14-17 ) .
Studies in T cells revealed that CD34 , coreceptor CD4 and CD8 , Src family kinase Lok and Fyn , and transmembrane adaptor LAT are also concentrated in lipid rafts ( 18-20 ) .
In contrast , CD45 , a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) , is so far the only phosphatase that has been shown to be excluded from lipid rafts ( 21 ) .
It is known that T cell activation is controlled by the coordinated action of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) and PTPs ( 22-24 ) .
However , it is not clear whether the segregation of PTKs and PTPs on T cell membrane is important for T cell activation .
In addition to CD45 , PTPs Sre homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP-1 ) and SHP-2 have also been implicated in the regulation of T cell activation ( 22-24 ) .
SHP-1 is expressed primarily in hemopoietic cells and plays a critical role in the negative regulation of signaling and development .
Accordingly , thymocytes derived from motheaten ( me ) mice , which lack the expression of functional SHP-1 , hyperproliferate in response to TCR stimulation ( 25-27 ) .
In contrast , SHP-2 is known for its requirement for the activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in nonhemopoietic cells and is expressed ubiquitously ( 28-30 ) .
In T lymphocytes , SHP-2 has also been shown to associate with TCR through its interaction with CTLA-4 and possibly to contribute to the dephosphorylation of CD3 subunits ( 31-33 ) .
Nevertheless , the precise functions of SHP-1 and SHP-2 as regulators in T cell membrane have yet to be determined .
Previously , we reported that when isolated T cell membranes were incubated with PTP inhibitors H , O ; or vanadate in the presence of ATP , the molecules enriched in lipid rafts , such as CD3 and protein kinases Lck , Fyn , Syk , and ZAP70 , were tyrosine phosphorylated ( 34 ) .
In this report , we show that PTP activity is found predominantly outside the lipid rafts and identify SHP-1 and 0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 3976 PTPs RESTRICT CD3-INDUCED TYR PHOSPHORYLATION TO LIPID RAFTS SHP-2 as two important membrane-associated PTPs in T cells .
The functional significance of restricted distribution of PTPs in membrane microdomains was further demonstrated by the inhibition of CD3-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation , IL-2 generation , and NE-AT activation in T cells with SHP-1 targeted to lipid rafts .
Taken together , our results suggest that restricted distribution of PTPs in membrane microdomains may play a critical role in the initiation of TCR/CD3 signaling .

The beads were washed twice with 0.1 % Triton X-100/TBS and once with TBS .
Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 50 pl of Laemmli reducing SDS sample buffer .
Proteins from ~10 ' cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane .
Membrane were blocked with 3 % BSA in TBST and incubated with Abs in TBST for 2 h at room temperature .
After four 15-min washes with TBST , the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated Ab for 30 min , washed three times for 5 min with TBST , and developed using the ECL system ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , U.K. ) .
Subcellular fractionation After washing in PBS , Jurkat T cells ( 2 X 10 '' ) were incubated in 2 ml of hypotonic buffer ( 42 mM KCI , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7.4 , 5 mM MgCl , ) for 15 min at 4°C .
Cells were passed through a 30-gauge needle 10 times , follwed by centrifugation at 250 X g for 10 min to remove the nuclei and intact cells .
The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 X g for 30 min at 4°C to separate the cytoplasm from the membrane fraction .
For sucrose density gradient centrifugation , the membrane fraction was lysed for 1 h at 4°C in 1 ml of 1 % Triton X-100 , 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , and a panel of protease inhibitors ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) .
The lysate was adjusted to 1.33 M sucrose by adding 1 ml of 85 % sucrose in TNE buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA ) .
In a SW41 centrifuge tube , the lysate was overlaid with 7 ml of 30 % and 3.5 ml of 5 % sucrose in TNE buffer .
The samples were centrifuged for 16-17 h at 38,000 rpm .
After equilibrium centrifugation , the gradients were fractionated from the top by 1.5 ml volume .
Phosphatase activity assays For assays that used p-nitrophenyl phosphate ( pNpp ) as the substrate , 50 pul of membrane suspension ( ODgy , = 6.0 ) was mixed with 50 pl of 2 % assay buffer containing 100 mM pNpp , 100 mM 2- ( N-morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid at pH 5.5 , 10 mM DTT , 150 mM NaCl , and 2 mM EDTA and incubated at 25°C for 20 min .

For assays with T cell membrane as the substrate , the membrane fraction was first incubated with 1 mM vanadate at 4°C for 10 min to inhibit PTP activity .
The membrane was then pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with 1.5 ml of cold hypotonic buffer , and then adjusted to concentration of 6.0 OD reading at 600 nm wavelength .
Fifty microliters of vanadate-treated membrane suspension was used as substrate in 100 pl of reaction mixture , which was incubated at 4°C for 10 min .
One millimolar ATP was then added to the mixture for 3 min at 37°C .
The membrane was precipitated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and then solublized in NP-40 lysis buffer .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins was determined by anti-pTyr ( 4G10 ) immunoprecipitation followed by anti-pTyr ( RC20 ) immunoblotting .
For assays with purified phosphatases , the Escherichia coli-overexpressed GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity column , and the activity was determined by pNpp assay with the enzyme unit of T cell PTP ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) as standard .
Construction , transfection , and stable expression of Lck/SHP-1 plasmid in Jurkat T cells To construct Lek/SHP-1 fusion plasmid , PCR was performed with human SHP-1 template with PCR primers 5'-ATGGGCTGTGGCTGCAGCTCA CACCCGGAAGATGACTGGATGGAGACCCTGCTCAAGGGCCGAGG TGTC ( underlined 42 nucleotides are from the N terminus of Lek ) and 5-CTTCCTCTTGAGGGAACCCTTGCTCTTC .
The PCR product was subcloned into mammalian expression vector pEF , /Myc-His ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) .
To generate Lck/SHP-1 ( AP ) , Lek/SHP-1 was digested by Bgill and Eagl !
and religated by blunt-end ligation , which removed a DNA fragment of 144 bp .
Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) cDNA encodes a mutant SHP-1 protein with a 48-aa truncation from residues 409-457 .
The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing .
Five micrograms of plasmids were transfected into Jurkat T cells ( 1 X 107/500 pl ) by electroporation with the settings of 800 uF , low ohm , and 250 V. The clones with stable expression of Lek/SHP-1 or Lck/SHP-1 ( AP ) were selected in medium containing neomycin ( G418 ) at 2.5 mg/ml .
Luciferase assays Luciferase assay was conducted with dual-luciferase reporter assay system ( Promega , Madison , WD ) .
Jurkat T cells ( 2 X 10 '' ) with stable expression of Leck/SHP-1 or Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) were transiently transfected with 5 ug of pNF-AT-Luciferase together with 1 pug of pRenilla-luciferase , and then cultured in 25 ml of medium for 16-20 h. Cells were aliquoted into a 24-well plate to a density of 2 X 10° per well in 500 ul of culture medium for subsequent stimulation .
Cells were either left unstimulated , stimulated with plate-bound CD3 plus PMA ( 50 ng/m ! 1 ) , or stimulated with PMA plus 1 uM ionomycin .
After 6-8 h , cells were harvested and washed with 1 ml of PBS .
Harvested cells were lysed in 100 ul of lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer and dual-luciferase activity was quantitated according to the manufacturer 's instruction with a monolight luminometer ( Analytical Luminescence Laboratory , Ann Arbor , MI ) .
Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate for each experimental condition .
ELISA of IL-2 in supernatants Anti-CD3 mAb ( OKT3 , 100 pul of 10 ug/ml ! )
was immobilized on an enzyme immunoassay RIA 96-well Costar microtiter plate ( Cambridge , MA ) in sterile PBS overnight at 4°C .
Wells were washed three times with PBS followed by the addition of 10° Jurkat T cells to wells containing PMA ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) or ionomycin ( Calbiochem ) .
After 24 h , supernatants were measured for IL-2 by standard ELISA techniques with paired capture and detection anti-IL-2 Abs ( OptEIA ; BD PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) .
Results SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases are predominantly localized in Triton X-100 soluble , nonlipid raft membrane fractions To date , the distribution of phosphatases in the cytoplasmic membrane of T lymphocytes has not been fully characterized .
Given our knowledge of the importance of lipid rafts in the propagation of signal transduction , we sought to identify the location of phosphatases in relation to lipid microdomains .
To this end , we segregated the plasma membrane of Jurkat T cells into nine fractions with sucrose gradient sedimentation , of which fractions 3 and 4 are enriched in lipid rafts ( insoluble in Triton X-100 ) and fractions 8 and 9 are derived from outside the lipid rafts ( soluble in Triton X-100 ; Fig .
1 ) .
We first identified the position of phosphatases by measuring PTP activities in each gradient fraction ( Fig .
1 , middle and right ) .
The results show that PTP activity is essentially located in fractions 8 and 9 , or outside the lipid rafts .

- Distribution of PTP activity in membrane fractions of sucrose density gradient .
T cell membranes were prepared from CD45 * Jurkat T cells or CD45 ( J45.01 ) T cells .
The PTP activity present in either the total membrane fraction ( Zef ? )
or individual sucrose density gradient fraction ( middle and right ) was analyzed by using pNpp as a substrate .
The PTP activity was determined by the release of nitrophenyl phosphate , which was measured at 450 nm .
membrane-associated phosphatase would be CD45 , a transmembrane PTP known to be excluded from lipid rafts ( 21 ) .
To address this possibility , we compared the total PTP activity in the plasma membrane of Jurkat T cells to its mutant cell line ( J45.01 ) lacking the expression of CD45 .
We found that the membrane of J45.01 T cells still contained ~40 % of the PTPs activity as compared with its parental cell line ( Fig .
1 , Zeff ) .
The phosphatases that remain in 145.01 T cells shared a similar distribution of PTP activity as the parental Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
1 , right ) .
We conclude that the majority of CD45 and other membrane-resident phosphatases are basically excluded from lipid microdomains .
SHP-1 is a phosphatase described to associate with a number of substrates , of which some are associated with plasma membrane , such as ZAP70 , CD3e , CD5 , leukocyte-associated Ig-like recep-tor-1 , and signal-regulatory proteins ( SIRP or SHPS-1 ; Refs .
26 , 35-39 ) .
In additional to CTLA-4 , SHP-2 also has been shown to associate with membrane anchor proteins such as SIRP or SHPS-1 and Protein Zero Related ( PZR ) ( 40 , 41 ) .
Given their importance in regulating TCR signaling , we attempted to examine whether SHP-1 and SHP-2 could be associated with cytoplasmic membrane .
To address this issue , Jurkat T cells were fractionated into cytosolic or membrane fractions with or without vanadate , an in-hibitor of PTPs known to induce potent tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
2A , top ) .
Our results indicate that ~5-10 % of SHP-1 was associated with T cell membrane , and this level increased after vanadate treatment .
SHP-2 did not associate with T cell membrane in basal state .
However , after vanadate treatment , nearly half of SHP-2 was recruited to the cell membrane .
This population of SHP-2 appeared to migrate at a higher position on SDS-PAGE , which is probably because of tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
24 , bottom ) .
Consistent with the distribution of PTP activity in lipid microdomains , Fig .
2B shows that , after vanadate treatment , the majority of SHP-1 and SHP-2 were present in Triton X-100 soluble fractions 8 and 9 or outside the lipid rafts .
Of note , a small amount of SHP-2 was also detected in fraction 3 .
The distribution of PTPs also was compared with that of other signaling molecules , such as CD3F , Lek , and LAT , which are enriched in lipid rafts .
As shown in Fig .
2C , we found that SHP-1 , SHP-2 , and CD45 PTPs were highly concentrated in fractions 8 and 9 or outside the lipid rafts , whereas CD34 , Lok and LAT were enriched in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions 3 and 4 .
Stimulation by anti-CD3 Ab did not alter the distribution of SHP-1 .

Isolated membranes were then subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation .
Proteins in each gradient fraction were lysed in 1 % NP-40 lysis buffer at 4°C for 4 h. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-pTyr mAb ( 4G10 ) and analyzed by immunoblotting with HRP-conjugated anti-pTyr Ab ( RC20 ) .

Although the distribution of Lek and LAT appeared unchanged after stimulation , the amount of CD3Z in lipid rafts ( fractions 3 and 4 ) appeared to have increased slightly .
All together , these results indicate that SHP-1 and SHP-2 as well as CD45 phosphatases are excluded from lipid rafts , and their distribution is consistent with the location of bulk PTP activity ( Fig .

CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 and CD3€ was detected predominantly in Triton X-100-insoluble lipid raft membrane fractions To investigate whether the restricted distribution of PTPs in membrane subdomains could affect CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation ( pTyr ) , we analyzed the protein tyrosine phosphorylation in membrane subdomains .

GST-fusion proteins of SHP-1 and SHP-2 containing PTP activity ranging from 0.2 to 20 U were incubated with vanadate ( Va ) -pretreated T cell membrane as a substrate .

fractions 3 , 4 , and 5 , which corresponded to materials derived from lipid rafts .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3Z and CD3e in fractions 8 or 9 , where they colocalize with phosphatases , was only minimal .
However , Jurkat T cells treated with vanadate exhibited a remarkably different pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
3B ) .
Proteins , including CD3Z and CD3¢e , were phosphorylated in virtually all the membrane fractions , including those where phosphatases were located ( fraction 8 and 9 ) .
A relative high level of basal tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in Fig .
3B .
But basal phosphorylation of CD3 and CD3¢e was consistently detected only in lipid raft fractions as shown in Fig .
34 .
These results indicate that CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation may be restricted to lipid rafts by phosphatases like SHP-1 , SHP-2 , and CD45 .
Phosphorylation of substrates outside the lipid rafts may be suppressed by the dominance of phosphatases .

Wild-type Jurkat T cells ( WT ) and Jurkat T cells stably expressing Lck/SHP-1 or Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) were fractionated into cytosolic ( C ) and membrane ( M ) fractions .
Proteins in each fraction were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-1 Ab , subjected to SDS-PAGE , and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP-1 ( Zef ? f ) or anti-Myc ( right ) Ab .
C , Microdomain distribution of membrane-associated Lck/ SHP-1 , Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) CD34 , Lok , and LAT .
Membranes were isolated from Jurkat T cells stably expressing Lck/SHP-1 ( ¢op ) or Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) ( bottom ) and segregated by sucrose gradient centrifugation .
Proteins in each fraction were solubilized in NP-40 lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-1 Ab followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Myc Ab ; or 40 pil of each fraction was immunoblotted with anti-CD3¢ , anti-Lck , and anti-LAT .
SHP-1 and SHP-2 inhibits membrane protein tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro To investigate whether SHP-1 and SHP-2 are involved in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in T cell membrane , we compared the relative efficiencies of SHP-1 , SHP-2 , and CD45 phosphatases in inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphorylation .
As shown 3979 C 0 & 2 '' € f & y £ CD32 cost 10 , FIGURE 6 .
Inhibition of CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells expressing Lck/SHP-1 .
Wild-type Jurkat T cells ( WT ) and Jurkat T cells expressing Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) or Lek/SHP-1 either were left unstimulated or stimulated with OKT3 .
Isolated membranes were segregated into nine fractions by sucrose gradient centrifugation .
Fraction 3 of each gradient was analyzed for protein tyrosine phosphorylation as described in the legend to Fig .
3. in Fig .
44 , both purified SHP-1 and SHP-2 could quantitatively block the overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T cell membrane .
The effect of purified SHP-1 , SHP-2 , and €D45 on substrate dephosphorylation were further compared in a time course ( Fig .
4B ) .
We observed that both SHP-1 and SHP-2 dephosphorylated proteins within 5 min of incubation .
In comparison , CD45 was less effective at the same catalytic units , as the dephosphorylation of proteins was less apparent even after 10 min .
N-terminal region of Lok is sufficient to confer localization of SHP-1 into lipid rafts If perpetual exclusion of PTPs from lipid microdomains is necessary to protect phosphorylated molecules from phosphatases , the presence of PTPs in lipid rafts may diminish CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and T cell activation .
To test this hypothesis , we targeted SHP-1 phosphatase into lipid microdomains by using the N-terminal region of Lek , which contains sites of palmitoylation known for anchoring proteins to lipid rafts ( 42 , 43 ) .
Leck/SHP-1 chimeric molecule was constructed by fusion of the 14-aa N-terminal of Lek to a full-length SHP-1 phosphatase ( Fig .
5A ) .
The control fusion molecule was made with a catalytically inactive SHP-1 ( AP ) , which has a 48-aa deletion in the PTP domain .
These constructs were stably expressed as C-terminal Myc-tagged proteins in Jurkat T cells .
To control for the expression of Lek/SHP-land Leck/SHP-1 ( AP ) , cell lines were selected based on equivalent levels of anti-Myc immunoblotting .
Fig .
5B shows the expression and subcellular distribution of Lek/SHP-1 and Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) molecules in Jurkat T cell lines .
The top band detected by both anti-SHP-1 and anti-Myc Ab is Lek/SHP-1 , which is 24 aa longer than the endogenous SHP-1 ( middle band ) .
The bottom band is Lck/SHP-1 ( AP ) , which is 24 aa shorter than the endogenous SHP-1 .
In contrast to endogenous SHP-1 , most of which were cytosolic , more of the overexpressed Lek/SHP-1 and Leck/SHP-1 ( AP ) were detected in the membrane .
More importantly , both Lek/ SHP-1and Leck/SHP-1 ( AP ) were enriched in lipid rafts whereas the patterns of membrane distribution of CD3Z , Lek , and LAT were 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 3980 PTPs RESTRICT CD3-INDUCED TYR PHOSPHORYLATION TO LIPID RAFTS basically not altered and resemble that as seen in wild-type Jurkat T cells ( Figs .
3 and 5C ) .
Therefore , the 14-aa N-terminal of Lek is sufficient for targeting SHP-1 into lipid microdomains .
Targeting of Lck/SHP-1 into lipid rafts inhibited CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in lipid rafts , IL-2 generation , and NFAT activation To examine the effects of targeting SHP-1 into lipid microdomains , Jurkat T cells expressing Lck/SHP-1 were stimulated with anti-CD3 Ab to induce tyrosine phosphorylation .
As shown in Fig .
6 , Jurkat T cells that expressed Leck/SHP-1 chimeric molecules were refractory to CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3Z and CD3e in the lipid raft fraction .
However , in Jurkat T cells expressing the mutant Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) construct , tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3¢ and CD3¢e appeared similar to that detected in wild-type Jurkat T cells .
The inhibition of CD3-induced phosphorylation is dependent on the catalytic domain of SHP-1 phospha-tase , and the mechanism of inhibition is not attributable to simple displacement of endogenous Lock from lipid rafts .
The functional consequence of targeting Lek/SHP-1 into lipid rafts was analyzed for its effect on the activation of NF-AT , a T cell-specific transcriptional factor necessary for IL-2 gene expression and IL-2 generation .

7 demonstrated that the presence of A ba © __ OKT3+PMA w © ta a NFAT luciferase activity ( fold over basal ) ta Jurkat Lck/SHP-1 ( aP ) __ Lek/SHP-1 12000 , OKT3+PMA 1000 { 8000 6000 .

This inhibition is again dependent on an intact catalytic domain of SHP-1 , as cells expressing Lck/SHP-1 ( AP ) were largely not inhibited from activating NF-AT-mediated transcription and IL-2 generation ( Fig .
7 , lef ? ) .
The proximal events of TCR-induced activation can be bypassed with PMA plus ionomycin .
Accordingly , we showed that PMA plus ionomycin could circumvent the defect seen in Jurakat T cells transfected with Lck/ SHP-1 ; thus , the inhibition imposed by Leck/SHP-1 lies upstream of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways .
Taken together , by allowing phosphatases to enter lipid rafts , the physiological boundary imposed by lipid microdomains is disrupted , and the cells are no longer capable of responding to agonist ligands .
Discussion To study the mechanism by which PTPs down-regulate CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation , we analyzed the subdomain distribution of PTPs in T cell membrane .
Our results indicate that PTPs are not distributed homogeneously in the plasma membrane .

6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology suggesting that PTPs are excluded from lipid rafts ( Fig .
1 ) .
Previously , CD45 , an abundant transmembrane receptor-like PTP , was shown to be excluded from lipid rafts ( 21 ) .
Here , we provide evidence showing that membrane-associated population of SHP-1 and SHP-2 are also excluded from lipid rafts ( Fig .
2 ) .
Because SHP-1 and SHP-2 are more potent than CD45 in the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
4 ) , this observation suggests that exclusion of SHP-1land SHP-2 from lipid rafts may be important for the initiation of TCR activation .
Aggregated lipid rafts may provide the molecular basis for segregating PTPs from PTKs .
In resting state , various molecules involved in T cell activation are sequestered among the small and discrete clusters of lipid rafts .
In this physical state , phosphatases like SHP-1 and CD45 can readily dominate and interfere with the initiation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation .
However , when lipid rafts are aggregated by receptor cross-linking or when concentrated in a specific contact area between T cells and APCs , a large patch of the membrane formed by the coalescence of smaller clusters of lipid rafts may bring together molecules like CD34 , Lck , and LAT and expel PTPs from the contact area .
Aggregated lipid rafts may impose a physical barrier that further distances phosphatases from their potential substrates , thus creating an environment within lipid rafts that would favor unrestrained kinase activity .
Therefore , our finding reinforced the notion that exclusion of PTPs from T cell activation domain or segregation of PTPs from receptor/PTKs complexes by lipid rafts may potentiate the initiation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation .
This is supported by our results demonstrating that CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3Z is largely restricted to lipid rafts ( Fig .
3 ) .
Our observations indicate that a fraction of SHP-1 was constitutively associated with T cell membrane .
The molecular basis for this association is currently unclear .
A plausible explanation would be the association between Sre homology 2 domains of SHP-1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated residues of transmembrane receptors or anchors , such as the recently identified leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 and SHPS-1 ( 38 , 39 ) .
This would be consistent with the increased association of SHP-1 with plasma membrane of vanadate-treated cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
SHP-1 in untreated cells could be associated with transmembrane receptors that have a low level of basal phosphorylation .
The association of SHP-2 with T cell membrane is dependent on vanadate or anti-CD3 stimulation .
Several transmembrane proteins , such as CTLA-4 , SIRP ( SHPS-1 ) , and PZR contain the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs that are potential membrane anchors for SHP-2 ( 31-33 , 40 , 41 ) .
It is interesting , though , that a small but significant amount of SHP-2 was detected in lipid rafts on T cell stimulation ( Fig .
2 ) .
This could be mediated by the association of Grb2 with SHP-2 , because Grb2 has been shown to enter lipid rafts upon phosphorylation ( 20 ) .
SHP-2 is so far the only PTPs shown to translocate into lipid rafts on T cell activation , and the biological significance of this observation warrants further studies .
To address the biological significance of PTP exclusion from lipid rafts , we targeted SHP-1 into lipid rafts by using the 14-aa N-terminal of Lek , which contains a lipid rafts targeting motif ( Fig .
5 ) .
Our results indicate that the presence of Lek/SHP-1 in lipid rafts inhibited CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD32 , as well as IL-2 generation and NF-AT-mediated transcriptional activation ( Figs .
6 and 7 ) .
As reported previously , overex-pression of the wild-type SHP-1 in Jurkat T cells did not affect T cell function ; thus , it is unlikely that the increased phosphatase activity of Lck/SHP-1 alone is responsible for the inhibition ( 35 ) .
Also , by using the 14-aa N-terminal of Lek as a targeting strategy did not result in the displacement of endogenous Lock from lipid 3981 rafts , as the control Lek/SHP-1 ( AP ) chimera did not inhibit CD3-induced signaling .
Therefore , we surmise that the Leck/SHP-1 chimeric molecule was able to breach the physical barrier imposed by lipid rafts , gaining access to the potential substrates that otherwise would not be available .
Collectively , our results strongly support the notion that phosphatases , such as SHP-1 , SHP-2 , and CD45 , are normally excluded from lipid rafts , and their restricted distribution may serve a unique function in regulating T cell activation .
