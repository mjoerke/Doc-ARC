ABSTRACT Here , we report the functional expression of CD40 on human malignant melanomas ( MMs ) .
Comparison of tumor specimen from MM precursor lesions , primary tumors , and metastases revealed that CD40 surface expression is down-regulated during tumor progression .
CD40 expression was confirmed in 7 human MM cell lines established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases , whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were CD40 negative .
CD40 expression could be enhanced in CD40-positive MM by stimulation with IFN-y and tumor necrosis factor- « but not by interleukin ( IL ) -1B or CD40 triggering .
CD40 ligation on MM by CD4O0L-transfected murine L-cells or by a soluble CD4O0L fusion protein up-regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL-6 , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor-a , and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor xB .
Furthermore , CD40 ligation of a HLA-A2* , MelanA/MART1* MM cell line enhanced its susceptibility to specific lysis by a HLA-A2-restricted , MelanA/MART-1-specific CTL clone .
Finally , CD40 ligation induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in MM .
These results indicate that CD40-CD40L interactions may play an important role in augmenting antitumor immunity and inducing apoptosis in some CD40-positive immunogenic human MMs .
INTRODUCTION CD40 , a M , 45,000-50,000 integral membrane protein , is a member of a protein family that includes the TNF-RI , * TNF-RIL , p75 nerve growth factor receptor , CD30 , CD27 , Fas , and others ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Expression and function of CD40 on B cells have been studied intensively ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Several reports show that the expression of CD40 is not restricted to cells of the B lineage because CD40 is functionally expressed on dendritic cells , monocytes , vascular endothelial cells , keratinocytes , and fibroblasts ( reviewed in Refs .
1-3 ) .
The ligand for CD40 ( CD4O0L , CD154 , TRAP , or gp39 ) , a type II membrane protein with significant sequence homology to TNF , is primarily expressed on activated CD4 * T cells but is also found on stimulated CD8 * T cells , mast cells , eosinophils , B cells , and dendritic cells ( 2 , 4 ) .
CD40 ligation induces functional changes in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells , including the up-regulation of MHC , costimulatory , and adhesion molecules and the secretion of cytokines , which all participate in T cell-mediated immune re Received 10/27/98 ; accepted 1/21/99 .

Furthermore , a CD40 stimulus is an important factor for the induction of CTLs ( 4-9 ) .
However , consequences of CD40 stimulation are not limited to the induction of T cell- or B cell-mediated immune responses because cross-linking of CD40 has also profound effects on cell proliferation and viability .
Ligation of CD40 results in enhanced proliferation of fibroblasts and B cells ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) , but inhibition of cell proliferation is described for keratinocytes and neoplastic cells such as B lymphomas ( reviewed in Refs .
1-3 ) .
Moreover , following CD40 signaling apoptosis is induced in the human myeloma cell line XG2 ( 10 ) and in transformed cells of mesenchymal and epithelial origin ( 11 ) .
MM has been described as an immunogenic tumor , which is infiltrated by CD4* and CD8 * T cells ( 12 ) .
MMs have been shown to express both MHC class I and class II molecules and to stimulate the proliferation of autologous CD4* and CD8 * T lymphocytes in vitro ( 13 ) .
Furthermore , human MMs are susceptible to specific lysis by CD8 * CTLs that recognize MHC class I-associated peptides derived from different melanoma-specific antigens ( reviewed in Ref .
14 ) .
Additionally , human MM can produce a range of cytokines capable of enhancing T cell-mediated immunity , including IL-1 , TNF-a , IL-6 , IL-8 , and GM-CSF ( 15 ) .
However , the mechanisms by which cytokine expression of MM is regulated are largely unknown .
A potent transcription factor of these cytokines is which is known to be activated , among other stimuli , by CD40 triggering on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells ( reviewed in Ref .
16 ) .
Recently , it has been described that MM cells express CD40 both in vivo and in vitro ( 17 , 18 ) , but little is known about its function .
Here , we demonstrate in some CD4O0-positive immunogenic human MM that CD40/CD40L-mediated signals activate transcription factor NF-B , enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines as well as of immunorelevant surface molecules , and augment their specific CTL-mediated lysis .
Moreover , CD40 triggering markedly inhibits the growth of these MM cell lines via the induction of apoptosis .

P. van Muijen ( Department of Pathology , University of Nijmegen , Nijmegen , The Netherlands ) ; Termel 1-3 were generated in our laboratory from lymph node melanoma metastases , 384/33 and 397/22 , which were generated from spontaneously regressing MM and were a gift from Dr. A. Mackensen ( Department of Medicine I , University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany ) ; and LB39-Mel , LB373 , LB265 , LB33-Mel , LB24 , LG2-Mel , and MZ2-Mel.43 and the MelanA/MART-1-specific CTL clone LB373-CTL-246/15 were established at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research ( Brussels , Belgium ) .
The Daudi cell line and the fibroblast cell line L-M from C3H mice ( the CD4O0L-transfected and the untransfected control cell line ) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection .
The HLA-A2-positive transporters associated with antigen processing-deficient T-B-lymphoblast hybridoma T2 has been described previously ( 20 ) .
RPMI 1640 ( Biochrom , Berlin , Germany ) and Iscove 's modified DMEM ( Life Technologies , Inc. , Eggenstein , Germany ) were supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS ( PAA , Coelbe , Germany ) , 1 mM nonessential amino acids , 50 pg/ml penicillin-streptomycin , and 2 mM L-glutamine ( all from Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
Cultures of nontransformed melanocytes were established from human neonatal foreskin by digestion with dispase ( 2 h at 37°C ) and trypsin ( 10 min at 37°C ) and maintained in selective melanocyte growth medium ( PromoCell ) in a humidified atmosphere at 5 % CO ; .
Second-to fifth-passage melanocyte cultures were used for all experiments .
MM cells and murine L cells were cultivated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5 and 8 % CO , , respectively .
CTL clone LB373-CTL-246/15 , recognizing the MelanA/MART-1 peptide 27-35 ( EAAGIGILTV ) , was maintained in culture as described ( 21 ) .
In brief , 5 X 10° CTLs were transferred every 7 days to 2 ml of Iscove 's modified DMEM containing 10 % human serum and 50 units/ml IL-2 , 1 X 10° T2 cells ( y-irradiated , 100 Gy ) pulsed with 1 um peptide , and 1.5 X 10° EBV-transformed feeder B cells ( y-irradiated , 100 Gy ) .
Immunohistochemistry .
After the patients gave their informed consent , we obtained punch biopsies at the time of surgery from tumors of patients with primary melanoma ( # = 13 ) , cutaneous metastases of MM ( n = 10 ) , or benign melanocytic nevi ( n = 9 ) .
Samples were snap-frozen immediately and stored in liquid nitrogen until use .
Five-wm cryosections of tissue samples were stained with the CD4O-specific mAb EA-5 ( Calbiochem ) or an appropriate control mAb , using a four-step immunohistochemical staining protocol involving the avidin-biotin complex .
Staining was evaluated using a Zeiss Axioscope equipped with a MC100 camera system ( Gottingen , Germany ) .
Immunostaining and Flow Cytometry .
Cells were stained in PBS ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) at 4°C for 30 min with unconjugated primary mAb ( antigen-specific or control IgG ) followed by FITC-labeled F ( ab ) , fragments of goat antimouse IgG ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) and analyzed with a FACScan using the CellQuest software ( Becton Dickinson , Heidelberg , Germany ) .
Propidium iodide ( 5 ug/ml ; Sigma ) was added to exclude dead cells by appropriate gating .
A total of 10° viable cells per sample were analyzed and MFIs determined using CellQuest software .
cMFIs were calculated according to the following formula : ( antigen-specific mAb ) __ ( control mAb ) .. ( antigen-specific mAb ) MFT = Northern Blot Analysis of CD40 RNA .
MM cells ( 5 X 10° ) were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen after detachment from culture flasks with EDTA ( 5 mM in PBS ; Sigma ) at the indicated time points .
Total cellular RNA was extracted using a guanidinium-isothiocyanate containing lysis buffer with subsequent purification on a CsCl gradient .
Fifteen ug of the RNA were subjected to electrophoresis on 1 % agarose gels and transferred onto Hy-bond-N+ nylon membranes ( Amersham , Braunschweig , Germany ) by Northern blotting .
For blot hybridization , a full-length CD40 probe was labeled with [ °°P ] dCTP ( Amersham ) by the random primer method .
After washing , blots were exposed for autoradiography and films were scanned on a Herolab EA.S.Y RH3 ( Herolab , Wiesloch , Germany ) for densitometry and digital processing of picture positives .
MM Stimulation via CD40 .
Human melanoma cells were cultured for 24 h at 37°C/5 % CO , in medium with or without 200 units/ml IFN-y unless stated otherwise and then washed twice with PBS .
They were then stimulated for 48 h with sCD4O0L or with sCD4O0L preincubated for 1 h at 4°C with the neutralizing anti-CD40L mAb 39-1.106 ( 10 pg/m ! ) .
Alternatively , equal numbers of melanoma cells , with or without IFN-y pretreatment , were cultured on a monolayer of mitomycin C-treated ( 50 ug/ml , 30 min at 25°C ) CD4O0L* L-cells or control L-cells for 48 h at 37°C/5 % CO ; .
The cells were detached with 2 mM EDTA/PBS , and L cells were removed by immunomagnetic separation after incubation with a H2-K '' *-specific mAb using the Dynabeads system ( Dynal , Hamburg , Germany ) .
Cytokine ELISA .
Cell culture supernatants were assayed for the following human cytokines by specific ELISA according to the manufacturer 's instruc-tions : IL-1 B , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , transforming growth factor B1 , basic fibroblast growth factor , TNF- « , and GM-CSF ( all from R & D Systems ) .
Data are expressed as mean values of triplicate measurements * SD .
EMSA .
EMSA was performed as described ( 22 ) .
In brief , total cell extracts were prepared using a high-salt detergent buffer [ Totex ; 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 350 mm NaCl , 20 % ( w/v ) glycerol , 1 % ( w/v ) NP40 , 1 mm MgCl , , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.1 mm EGTA , 0.5 mm DTT , 0.1 % PMSF , and 1 % aprotinin ] .
Cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed once in ice-cold PBS ( Sigma ) and resuspended in four cell volumes of Totex buffer .
After 30 min on ice , the lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 X g at 4°C .
The protein content of the supernatant was determined and equal amounts of protein ( 10-20 ug ) added to a reaction mixture containing 20 ug of BSA ( Sigma ) , 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Boehringer-Mannheim , Germany ) , 2 pl of buffer D+ [ 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 20 % glycerin , 100 mM KCI , 0.5 mm EDTA , 0.25 % NP4O0 , 2 mM DTT , and 0.1 % PMSF ] , 4 l of buffer F ( 20 % Ficoll 400 , 100 mm Hepes , 300 mM KCI , 10 mm DTT , and 0.1 % PMSF ) , and 100,000 epm ( Cerenkov ) of a P-labeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 20 pl .
Samples were incubated at room temperature for 25 min .
NF-KB oligonucleotide ( Promega , Mannheim , Germany ) was labeled using [ y-*°P ] ATP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ; Amer-sham ) and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Promega ) .
Proliferation Assay .
MM cells at 10 X 10° , 5 X 10° , and 2 X 10° were cultured on monolayers of 2 X 10° CD4O0L-transfected or untransfected mitomycin C-treated L-cells in 96-well flat-bottomed plates ( Becton Dickin-son ) for 36 h. In some experiments , either biologically active sTNF-RI ( 0.5 pg/ml ) or APO1/Fas-immunoglobulin ( 20 ug/ml ) to neutralize MM derived TNF-a or APO1/FasL was added to the coculture .
[ °H ] JThymidine ( Amersham , Braunschweig , Germany ) was added at 1 wCi/well for the last 18 h of culture .
Plates were harvested with a Canberra Packard Filter-Mate ( Canberra Packard , Dreieich , Germany ) and incorporation of [ H ] thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a TopCount device ( Canberra Packard ) .
Data are expressed as mean cpm + SD of quadruple cultures .
Cytotoxicity Assay .
*'Cr-release assays , performed as described ( 13 ) , were used to assess cytotoxicity rates of the CTL clone LB373-CTL-246/15 ( spe-cific for MelanA/MART1 peptide 27-35 ) against the MM cell line LB39-Mel ( HLA-A2* , MelanA/MART1* ) or against the HLA-A2* TAP-deficient T-B lymphoblast line T2 .
LB39-Mel cells with or without IFN-y priming ( 200 units/ml , 24 h ) were cocultured with mitomycin C-treated L-cells ( CD4O0L-transfected or control ) and then purified by immunomagnetic separation as described above .
Thereafter , target cells ( either LB39-Mel or T2 ) were labeled with 1 mCi/ml Na ; , °'CrO , ( Amersham ) for 1 h at 37°C/8 % CO ; , and then washed with medium .
T2 cells were either pulsed with MelanA/MARTI1 peptide EAAGIGILTV at 1 uM immediately prior to use ( positive control ) or were left untreated ( negative control ) .
°'Cr-labeled target cells ( 2 X 10° cells/well ) were incubated with LB373-CTL-246/15 at the indicated E : T ratios for 4 h at 37°C in a final volume of 200 pl in V-bottomed 96-well plates ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Spontaneous °'Cr-release was determined by culture of identical numbers of labeled target cells without CTLs ; maximum °'Cr-release by addition of 1 % Triton X-100-PBS to target cells .
Fifty wl per well were then transferred onto Luma plates ( Canberra Packard ) dried and analyzed using a TopCount device .
Percentage of specific lysis was calculated according to the formula : % specific lysis = [ ( test *'Cr release - spontaneous *'Cr release ) / ( maximum °'Cr release - spontaneous *'Cr release ] X 100 Detection of Apoptosis .
The percentage of viable melanoma cells after CD40 stimulation or no treatment was compared by FACS analysis after staining with propidium iodide ( 5 ug/ml ) in PBS .
For detection of DNA laddering , MIRW or LB39-Mel , with or without IFN-y priming , were stimulated for 48 h with L-cells ( CD4O0L* or untransfected controls ) or with sCD40L as described above .
For analysis of total cellular DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis , 10° cells were washed twice with TE buffer [ 10 mm Tris ( pH 7.4 ) -1 mM EDTA ] followed by cell lysis with TTE buffer ( TE buffer + 0.2 % 1288 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

DNA was extracted by incubation of cell lysates with ice-cold TTE buffer , 2-propanol , and 5 M NaCl ( 5:7:1 ) at 4°C overnight .
Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min , and the DNA-containing pellet was air-dried for 3 h at RT .
After solubilization of the pellet with TE buffer , DNA samples were separated in 2 % agarose/Tris-borate-EDTA gels .
Afterward , DNA was stained with ethidium bromide , and gels were photographed using a Herolab E.A.S.Y RH3 device .
Alternatively , detection of DNA fragmentation was performed using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling assay .
In brief , 10° MM cells were stained with the in situ cell death detection kit from Boehringer ( Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and subsequently analyzed on a FACScan using CellQuest software ( Becton Dickinson ) .

1C ) .
In aggregate , we observed a gradual loss of CD40 surface antigen during melanoma progression .
To confirm and extend these results , cultured human MM cell lines were examined for surface expression of CD40 by flow cytometry .
Staining of melanoma cell lines with the CD4O0-specific antibodies G28.5 and EA-5 revealed 7 of 18 to be CD40 positive .
Fig .
1D shows three representative cell lines positive for the CD40 antigen .
Interest-ingly , 2 of 7 CD4O-positive MM cell lines were established from highly immunogenic melanomas , whereas the other CD40 positive MM cell lines were established from MM metastases , characterized by slow local tumor growth and low metastatic potential in nu/nu mice ( 23 ) .
On the other hand , all CD4O0-negative MM cell lines were established from rapidly growing advanced stages of melanoma me-tastases .
IFN-y was shown to up-regulate CD40 expression on cultured human keratinocytes , thymic epithelial cells , and vascular endothelial cells , whereas TNF-a and IL-1B had no effect ( reviewed in Refs .
1-3 ) .
To investigate whether these cytokines modulate the level of CD40 on MM , flow cytometry was performed after IFN-y , TNF- « , IL-1 , and CD40 stimulation .
A 48-h treatment with IFN-y ( 200 units/ml ) or TNF-a ( 50 ng/m ! )
led to a 2-fold increase in the MFI of CD40 surface staining , whereas IL-1 ( 1000 units/ml , 48 h ) or CD40 triggering ( CD40 * L-cells or sCD4O0L ) had no effect ( Table 1 and data not shown ) .
Of note , none of these treatments could induce CD40 expression in CD40 negative MM cell lines ( data not shown ) .
A weak CD40 surface expression was also observed on 3 of 3 human melanocyte cell lines cultured in melanocyte growth medium containing insulin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( data not shown ) .
CD40 mRNA levels were determined in human MM by Northern blot analysis .
A single 1.3-1.4-kb mRNA transcript was observed in the MM cell line MIRW ( Fig .
1£ ) , corresponding to the CD40 mRNA transcript described for human B cells and the MM cell line HS294T ( 24 ) .

ng/ml ) resulted in a 2-3-fold induction of CD40 transcription levels as early as 8 h after cytokine addition ( Fig .
1€ ) .
In contrast , IL-1B had no effect ( Fig .
Again , neither IFN-y nor TNF-a induced CD40 RNA transcription in MM that did not constitutively express CD40 antigen ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that the IFN-y and TNF-a induced up-regulation of surface CD40 expression ( Table 1 ) is likely to be the result of increased CD40 mRNA transcription .
CD40 Stimulation Induces the Release of Proinflammatory Cytokines by Melanoma Cells .
It has been reported that CD40 ligation induces the secretion of cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-6 from human keratinocytes , fibroblasts , monocytes , B cells , and dendritic cells ( reviewed in Refs .
1-3 ) .
Because MMs are capable of producing IL-8 , IL-6 , TNF-a , and GM-CSF among other T-cell chemotactic or T cell-activating cytokines ( 15 , 25 ) , we analyzed the effects of CD40 ligation on cytokine secretion by the human MM cell line LB39-Mel ( Fig .
2 ) .
LB39-Mel showed no constitutive expression of IL-8 or IL-6 and only low basal levels of GM-CSF and TNF-a ( Fig .
2 ) .
Moreover , none of these cytokines could be detected in the supernatants of CD40-transfected or control L-cells cultured alone ( Fig .
2 ) .
CD40L * L-cells stimulated LB39-Mel to secrete high levels of IL-8 and IL-6 ( 4 g/ml and 3-4 ng/ml , respectively ) , whereas control L-cells had no effect ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) .
A 24-h priming of LB39-Mel with IFN-y ( 200 units/ml ) prior to CD40 stimulation had a additive effect resulting in a 2-fold increase in IL-8 and IL-6 secretion ( 8 ug/ml and 10-12 ng/ml ; Fig .
2 , A and B ) .
Likewise , CD40L * L-cells stimulated the production of TNF-a ( Fig .
2C ) and GM-CSF ( Fig .
2D ) .
This CD40-induced TNF-a ( 7-8 ng/ml ) and GM-CSF ( 30 pg/ml ! )
secretion was further enhanced ( TNF-a , 20 ng/ml ; GM-CSF 60 pg/m ! l ) by IFN-y priming ( Fig .
2 , C and D ) .
Similar results were obtained with the human MM cell lines LB373 , MM1 , and MIRW stimulated with CD40L * L-cells and MIRW or LB39-Mel stimulated with sCD4OL , except that GM-CSF and TNF-a were not detectable in MIRW ( data not shown ) .
Of note , IFN-y alone had no effect on the basal production of IL-8 , IL-6 , TNF-a @ , or GM-CSF in any of the MM cell lines studied ( Fig .
2 and data not shown ) .
We conclude that CD40 ligation stimulates specifically the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 , IL-6 , and , in some cases , TNF-a and GM-CSF from CD40-positive human melanoma cells , whereas the production of other cytokines/growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor , transforming growth factor B1 , IL-10 , and IL-1 B is not affected ( data not shown ) .

The effect of CD40 ligation on the activation of NF-kB in human melanoma cells .
LB39-Mel and MIRW cells were either left untreated ( Lanes 7 ) or stimulated for the indicated periods with TNF- @ ( 50 ng/ml ; Lanes 2 ) , sCD40L ( Lanes 3 ) , and sCD4OL preincubated with the anti-CD40L mAb TRAP ( 10 ug/ml ; Lanes 4 ) .
Total extracts of 10° cells were prepared and assayed for NF-KB binding by EMSA .
Filled arrowhead , position of NF-kB DNA complexes ; O , nonspecific binding of the probe ; open arrowhead , unbound oligonucleotide .
all cytokines and surface molecules we found up-regulated in CD40-triggered MM cells can be induced by NF-KB ( 16 ) , we tested whether NF-KB is activated by CD40 signals in human melanoma cell lines .
CD40 ligation on LB39-Mel and MIRW led to the activation of NF-B , as detected by EMSA 30 min and 1 h after stimulation with sCD40L ( Fig .
3 , Lanes 3 ) .
This effect was inhibited completely by preincubation of sCD40L with an anti-CD40L mAb ( TRAP , 10 ug/ ml ) for 30 min at 4°C ( Fig .
3 , Lanes 4 ) .
Stimulation of MM cells with TNF-a ( 50 ng/ml ; Ref .
28 ) was used as a positive control ( Fig .
3 , Lanes 2 ) .
CD40 Ligation Up-Regulates Immunorelevant Surface Molecules on Melanoma Cells .
APC triggering of CD40 by CD4OL leads to the up-regulation of molecules involved in T-cell adhesion , antigen presentation , and activation , such as ICAM-1 , MHC class I and II molecules , costimulatory molecules of the B7 family , and CD40 ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Because MM cells are also capable of expressing some of these molecules , we investigated the effects of CD40 ligation on their expression of ICAM-1 , MHC class I and II , B7-1 , B7-2 , CD95 , CD95L , CD44 , CD4O0L , and CD40 by FACS .
MM cells were either untreated or primed with IFN-y ( 200 units/ml , 24 h ) and then incubated for 48 h with sCD4O0L , preincubated with the blocking mAb 39-1.106 or appropriate isotype control mAb ( Fig .
4 ) .
MIRW constitutively expressed low level of surface MHC class I molecules ( cMFI = 80 ; Fig .
44 ) .
MIRW stimulated with sCD4OL without IFN-y priming showed only a weak up-regulation of MHC class I molecules ( ¢cMFI = 100 ) .
By contrast , after IFN-y priming , CD40 stimulation induced a 2-fold up-regulation ( ¢MFI = 240 ) of MHC class I molecules compared to MIRW primed with IFN-y alone ( cMFI = 115 ; Fig .
44 ) .
The expression level of MHC class II molecules on MIRW melanoma cells was affected analogously by CD40 stimulation ( Fig .
4B ) .
The cMFI of MHC class II was elevated 1.5-fold after the combined IFN-y/CD40 stimulation ( ¢MFI = 68 ) , compared to IFN-y priming alone ( cMFI = 40 ; Fig .
4B ) .
Of note , MIRW did not express MHC class II molecules in the absence of IFN-y as detected by FACS ( Fig .
4B ) .
Likewise , ICAM-1 levels were elevated 3-fold after IFN-y/CD40 stimulation ( ¢cMFI = 700 ) , compared to basal levels ( cMFI = 180 ; Fig .
4C ) .
An enhanced shedding of soluble ICAM-1 paralleled this increase in surface ICAM-1 expression as determined by specific ELISA ( Fig .
4D ) .
All effects were specific for CD40 because they were reduced or inhibited by preincubation of sCD40L with the anti-CD40L mAb 39-1.106 but not with an isotype control mAb ( Fig .
4 ) .
Comparable results were observed with the melanoma cell line LB39-Mel stimulated with sCD40L or with CD4O0L * L-cells ( data not shown ) .
On the other hand , no CD4O0-mediated alterations in the surface expression of CD95 , CD95L , B7-1 , B7-2 , CD44 , CD4O0L , or CD40 could be detected ( data not shown ) .
CD40 Stimulation Enhances Tumor-specific CTL-mediated Killing of Melanoma Cells .
Recently it has been demonstrated that CD40/CD4O0L-mediated signals are involved in the induction of CTLs ( 4-8 ) .
Moreover , CTLs recognize melanoma-specific antigens in a MHC class I-restricted fashion , and the expression levels of ICAM-1 and MHC class I are crucial for adhesion , recognition , and lysis of target cells by CD8 * CTLs ( 29 ) .
We , therefore , investigated whether the CD40 mediated up-regulation of these molecules ( Fig .
4 ) affects melanoma cell lysis by CD8 * CTLs .
Cytotoxicity assays were performed using as targets the HLA-A2* MelanA/MART-1~* human melanoma cell line LB39-Mel stimulated with CD40+* L-cells or control L-cells .

CD4O-triggering enhances tumor antigen specific CTL-lysis of human melanoma .
Specific lysis of CD40 stimulated LB39-Mel MM cells ( HLA-A2* , MelanA/ MART1* ) by anti-MelanA/MART1 ( peptide 27-35 ) specific CTL clone LB373-CTL-246/15 is shown .
'Cr-labeled targets were incubated with LB373-CTL-246/15 at the indicated E : T ratios .
Chromium release was measured after 4 h , and the percentage of specific lysis was calculated as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
A , lysis of chromium-labeled T2 cells by LB373-CTL-246/15 in the presence ( @ ) or absence ( O ) of the MelanA/MART1 peptide EAAGIGILTV ( 1 pm ) .
B , lysis of LB39-Mel melanoma cells with ( @ ) or without ( O ) IFN-y priming ( 200 units/ml/24 h ) or LB39-Mel melanoma cells primed with IFN-y followed by a 48-h coculture with irradiated L-cells either CD40L-transfected ( BBI ) or control ( ] ) .
Data points , means of triplicate cultures from a representative experiment of two performed .
fashion was used as the effector population .
Peptide specificity of CTL clone LB373-CTL-246/15 was confirmed using HLA-A2+* T2 target cells pulsed with 1 um MelanA/MART-1 peptide 27-35 ( Fig .
5A , closed circles ) or left untreated ( Fig .
5A , open circles ) .
Impor-tantly , CD40 ligation following IFN-y priming markedly enhanced the susceptibility of LB39-Mel melanoma cells to specific lysis by CTL clone LB373-CTL-246/15 ( 28 % specific lysis ; Fig .
5B , closed squares ) as compared to unstimulated MM ( 12 % specific lysis ; Fig .
5B , open circles ) .
Stimulation of LB39-Mel with IFN-y alone ( 16 % specific lysis ; Fig .
5B , open squares ) or CD40 *L L-cells alone ( 17 % specific lysis ; Fig .
5B , closed squares ) had only minor effects on CTL lysis .
Similar results were observed with LB39-Mel stimulated with sCD40L or CD40*L L-cells ( data not shown ) .
This indicates that CD40 ligation on human melanoma cells in the presence of IFN-y may play an important role in augmenting tumor lysis mediated by CD8 * CTL specific for melanoma antigens presented in the context of MHC class I molecules .
CD40 Ligation Induces Growth Inhibition and Apoptosis in Human Melanoma Cells .
Controversial effects of CD40 triggering on the growth of nontransformed and of transformed cells have been described .
Although CD40 stimulation of normal B cells leads to enhanced cell proliferation ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) , growth inhibition and apoptosis are observed in B lymphoma and myeloma ( 11 , 30 , 31 ) .
To examine CD4O0-mediated effects on the growth and survival of human melanoma cells , we determined the proliferation and viability of MM cells and performed DNA fragmentation assays .
LB39-Me ! , either untreated or primed with IFN-y for 24 h , were washed extensively , seeded at 3 X 10° cells in six-well plates and cultured either with medium alone , or stimulated with medium containing sCD40L ( Fig .
6 , A-D ) or with CD40L L-cells ( Fig .
66 ) .
After 72 h , the cultures were inspected by inverted microscopy and photomicrographs were taken ( Fig .
6 , A-D ) .
When compared to LB39-Mel cultured in medium ( Fig .
6A ) , a treatment with sCD40L ( Fig .
6B ) or IFN-y ( Fig .
6C ) alone had only moderate effects on cell density and cell morphology .
By contrast , following IFN-y priming , sCD4OL treatment led to dramatic decrease in density and numbers of MM cells ( Fig .
6D ) .
To confirm these results , MM cell proliferation was assessed by [ H ] thymidine incorporation ( Fig .
6E ) .
Forty-eight-h coculture of LB39-Mel with mitomycin C-treated CD40L * L-cells inhibited cell proliferation by 50 % , as compared to MM cells cocultured with nontransfected L-cells or cultured in medium alone ( Fig .
IFN-y priming further increased the CD40 induced inhibition of MM proliferation up to 70 % , whereas IFN-y alone had no effect ( Fig .
Addition of either sTNF-RI ( 0.5 ug/m ! 1 ) , which effectively neutralizes the activity of TNF-a released by MM , or of APO1/Fas-immunoglobulin ( 20 ug/ml1 ) , a biologically active inhibitor of FasL activity , did not influence the CD40-mediated growth inhibition ( data not shown ) .
Similar observations as shown in Fig .
6 , A-E , were made with MIRW ( data not shown ) .
Inverted microscopy of CD4O-stimulated MM also revealed morphological changes associated with apoptotic cell death-like membrane protrusion ( Ref .
32 ; Fig .
6D ) .
Indeed , FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained MIRW cells , cocultured for 48 h with CD40L * L-cells , demonstrated a 30 % decrease in MM cell viability ( data not shown ) .
IFN-y priming did not alter this effect .
To verify whether CD40 ligation induces apoptosis in MM , we analyzed DNA preparations by agarose gel electrophoresis .
Fragmentation of DNA was observed when MIRW were CD40 stimulated with sCD4OL for 48 h , either with or without IFN-y priming ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , prestimulation with IFN-y alone or culture for 48 h in medium had no effect ( data not shown ) .
DNA fragmentation in MM cells was also assessed by enzymatic incorporation of fluorescein-labeled dUTP into DNA strand breaks and subsequent FACS analysis .
FITC-dUTP-labeled DNA was detected when MIRW were cocultured for 72 h with sCD4O0L , either primed with IFN-y or left untreated ( Fig .
6F ) .
Similar results were observed when LB39-Mel cells were stimulated with either CD40L * L-cells or sCD40L ( data not shown ) .
The presence of sTNF-RI ( 0,5 ug/ml ! )
or APO1/Fas-immunoglobulin ( 20 ug/ml ! )
during the entire period of CD4O0-stimulation did not prevent the induction of apoptosis ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION CD40 expression on human melanoma ( MM ) was described previously ( 17 , 18 ) , but little was known about its biological relevance .
Here , we report the functional expression of CD40 on a subset of MM in situ as well as by some MM cell lines in vitro .
Specifically , we demonstrate a gradual loss of CD40 expression during melanoma progression in situ .
We also found human MM cell lines established from immunogenic MM but not from advanced-stage metastatic tissue positive for the CD40 antigen , thus paralleling the down-regulation of CD40 expression on MM metastases in situ .
These results are in line with previous reports that 50 % of MM cell lines generated from primary tumors , but only a minority of cell lines derived from metastases express CD40 ( 18 ) .
In CD4O0-positive but not in CD40-negative MM , the expression of this antigen was increased after stimulation with IFN-y or TNF-a but not with IL-1 or CD4OL .
By FACS analysis , we found none of the MMs positive for CD4O0L ( CD154 ) using two different antibodies ( 39-1.106 and TRAP ) .
We , therefore , can not support the theory of an autocrine CD40-CD40L stimulation loop in MM , as suggested by van den Oord et al .
( 17 ) .
Herein , we demonstrate that CD40 on human MM cells is functional because CD40 ligation stimulates their release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 , IL-8 , GM-CSF , and TNF- « .
We further demonstrate that cross-linking of CD40 on human MM up-regulates their surface expression of ICAM-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules , thus paralleling observations made in APCs ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
However , in contrast to APC , a CD4O0-mediated up-regulation of B7-1 , B7-2 , CD44 , or CD40 ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) was not detected .

Our finding that some CD4O-triggered MM cell lines release substantial amounts of IL-6 , IL-8 ( MIRW , LB39-Mel , MMI , and LB373 ) , and GM-CSF and TNF-a ( LB39-Mel , MMI1 , LB373 ) may have consequences for the generation of MM-specific immune responses .
For example , murine MMs transfected with the GM-CSF or IL-6 gene form significantly smaller tumors and are more likely to be rejected than untransfected controls ( 33-35 ) .
The CD40-induced secretion of IL-8 could also augment the interactions of MM and T cells because a major biological activity of IL-8 is the attraction and activation of T cells to sites of specific immune responses ( 36 ) .
Additionally , we find that TNF-a secretion is enhanced in some CD40-stimulated MMs , which could exert direct antineoplastic effects on those tumor cells ( 37 ) .
We wanted to characterize the mechanisms by which CD40 ligation up-regulates the above described surface molecules and cytokines in MM .
Our finding that CD40 signals lead to NF-kB mobilization in human MM suggests that the CD4O0-induced events are mediated , at least in part , through activated NF-KB , as has been shown in other cell types ( reviewed in Ref .
16 ) .
Because TNF-a activates NF-KB ( 16 ) and up-regulates the expression of ICAM-1 , MHC class I and class II and distinct cytokines in MM ( 38 ) , it is possible that these CD4O0-induced changes are due to TNF-a released from CD4O0-triggered MM .
However , we consider this possibility unlikely because we also observed a CD40 stimulation of ICAM-1 and MHC class I and II , IL-6 , and IL-8 in MIRW cells that did not secrete TNF-a following CD40 triggering .
Furthermore , a sTNF-RI that effectively neutralizes TNF-a activity did not block the CD4O0-triggered response in MM .
The importance of CD40-CD4O0L interactions for the activation of specific CTL-effector populations has recently been described ( 4-7 , 9 ) .
Here , we show that CD40 cross-linking leads to enhanced lysis of a HLA-A2* and MelanA/MART-1-expressing melanoma cell line by a MelanA/MART-1-peptide specific CTL clone .
It has been shown that the level of surface MHC class I expression on MM is crucial for their recognition by specific CTLs ( 39 ) .
Our observation that CD40 triggering up-regulates MHC class I molecules on MM may , thus , explain their enhanced susceptibility to specific CTL-mediated kill-ing .
This study also raises the possibility that in vivo CD40L-positive tumor-infiltrating CD4 * , CD8 * T cells may receive essential activation signals from CD4O0-positive MMs ( 4 , 40 , 41 ) .
Whether the secretion of soluble ICAM-1 molecules observed after CD40 stimulation in vitro has a negative impact on the susceptibility of MM to CTL lysis in vivo ( 42 , 43 ) remains to be evaluated .
Furthermore , our study demonstrates that CD40 ligation inhibits the growth and subsequently leads to apoptosis of MM .
This is in line with studies of CD4O0-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in transformed cells such as B lymphoma and myeloma ( 10 , 11 , 31 ) .
One explanation for CD40-mediated apoptotic signals is that the intracel- Fig .

EFFECTS OF CD40 LIGATION ON HUMAN MALIGNANT MELANOMA lular domain of CD40 shares structural homology with the death domains of p55TNFR and Fas ( 44 , 45 ) .
Additionally , a CD40 signaling domain involved in growth inhibition has been identified recently ( 30 ) .
We consider it unlikely that growth inhibition and apoptosis are due to TNF-a released by CD4O-triggered MM because they were also observed in TNF-a @ -deficient MIRW or in the presence of neutralizing sTNF-RI .
Moreover , CD40 stimulation did not alter or induce the expression of surface Fas or FasL on MM and a blocking APO-1/Fas-immunoglobulin had no effect on any CD40 triggered changes in MM .
Taken together , these data indicate that CD40-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in MM is not dependent on TNF-a or Fas/FasL expression .
Finally , our results support the notion that the loss of CD40 antigen during MM progression in vivo may represent yet another mechanism of tumor escape ( 43 ) .
Indeed , an inhibition of CD40/CD4OL interaction by anti-CD40L mAb prevented tumor rejection of CD40* B16-F10 murine MM cells ( 9 , 46 ) .
Thus , the latter report as well as this study point to an important role of CD40/CD4O0L-mediated signals in the generation and perpetuation of specific antitumor immunity in CD40-positive , immunogenic melanomas .
