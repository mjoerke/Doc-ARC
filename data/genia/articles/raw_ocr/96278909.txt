DNA Triplex Formation Selectively Inhibits Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor Gene Expression in Human T Cells* ( Received for publication , January 12 , 1996 , and in revised form , March 8 , 1996 ) Marina Kochetkova and M. Frances Shannont From the Division of Human Immunology , Hanson Centre for Cancer Research , Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science , Frome Road , Adelaide 5000 , South Australia , Australia Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is a hemopoietic growth factor that is expressed in activated T cells , fibroblasts , macrophages , and endothelial cells .
Although GM-CSF does not appear to be essential for normal hemopoiesis , overexpression of GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases such as myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation .
An NF- « B/Rel binding site within the GM-CSF promoter , termed the xB element appears to be important for controlling expression in reporter gene assays in response to a number of stimuli in T cells .
We investigated oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation across this regulatory sequence as a potential tool to inhibit GM-CSF gene transcription .
A 15-base oligonucleotide , GM3 , was targeted to a purine-rich region in the GM-CSF proximal promoter , which overlaps the xB element .
Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting demonstrated that GM3 formed a sequence-specific collinear triplex with its double-stranded DNA target .
Triplex formation by GM3 blocked recombinant and nuclear NF- « B proteins binding to the GM-CSF element .
GM3 also caused selective inhibition of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax transactivator-in-duced luciferase activity from a reporter construct driven by the GM-CSF promoter in Jurkat T cells .
Fi-nally , GM3 greatly reduced the concentration of endogenous GM-CSF mRNA induced by different stimuli in Jurkat T cells but did not affect interleukin 3 mRNA levels in the same cells .
We conclude that the xB element in the GM-CSF promoter plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of the endogenous GM-CSF gene .
Colinear triplex formation acts as a selective transcriptional repressor of the GM-CSF gene and may have potential therapeutic application in cases of undesirable overexpression of this protein .
Cytokines are a rapidly growing family of proteins that act as local or systemic intercellular regulatory factors .
They are involved in various developmental and differential processes and are important in the immune response to infection and injury .
However , cytokines are also implicated in the pathology of many clinical conditions including septic shock , parasitic infec-tions , chronic inflammation , atherosclerosis , and cancer ( 1 ) .

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is a cytokine involved in the control of survival , proliferation , and differentiation of hemopoietic progenitor cells as well as in the functional activation of mature myeloid cells ( reviewed in Ref .
2 ) .
GM-CSF '' expression occurs in different cell types , including fibroblasts and endothelial cells in response to proinflamma-tory agents such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , monocytes in response to endotoxin , and activated T cells ( reviewed in Ref .
3 ) .
Despite the clinical application of GM-CSF as an activator of hemopoietic cell production after bone marrow transplantation , evidence has accumulated to suggest that GM-CSF may play a role in the pathogenesis of several disease conditions , in particular myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation ( 4-7 ) .
GM-CSF was found to be abnormally expressed in atopic patients and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( 4 , 5 ) .
In terms of leukemia , GM-CSF has been shown to be produced by some leukemic clones in an autocrine fashion in vitro , and the growth of the cells in vitro depends on the presence of GM-CSF ( 8 ) .
Recent in vivo experiments have also shown that GM-CSF increased the blast cell counts in 9 of 12 acute myeloid leukemia patients ( 9 ) .
Taken together these data suggest that it would be of significant therapeutic importance to be able to modulate GM-CSF gene expression .
Synthetic oligonucleotides are attracting increasing interest as tools for specific manipulation of gene expression and have potential therapeutic application .
Several strategies that employ short nucleic acid fragments targeted to different intracel-lular components are currently under investigation with variable success ( reviewed in Ref .
10 ) .
The `` antigene '' ( 11 ) strategy is based on inhibition of transcription of the selected gene by oligonucleotide-directed intermolecular DNA triple helix formation either through prevention of regulatory proteins binding to the control regions ( 12 ) or by acting as transcriptional repressors ( 13 ) .
Triplex formation may have certain advantages over the other oligonucleotide-mediated strategies , as there are fewer target molecules per cell and it is expected to be more selective .
In vitro experiments demonstrated that the formation of such sequence-specific structures can inhibit DNA replication ( 14 ) or block transcription factors binding to the gene of interest and thereby directly affect transcription initiation ( 15 ) .
Triplex-forming oligonucleotides ( TFOs ) were also found to repress transcription in intact cells , resulting in highly specific inhibition of the synthesis of promoter reporter gene targets ( 16-18 ) .

14438 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Repression of GM-CSF Transcription by DNA Triple Helix quences have been shown to be suitable targets for intermolecular triple helices .
Different structures of base triplets have been described , forming two groups of DNA triple helices .
Both have the third strand binding in the major groove of the duplex DNA through Hoogsteen ( Y*RY motif ) or reverse Hoogsteen ( R*RY motif ) base pairing .
The best studied Y*RY type , formed by the addition of a polypyrimidine third strand , consists of C**G : C and T*A : T base triads with the third strand parallel to the purine-rich strand of the underlying duplex ( 19 , 20 ) .
These triplexes are stable only under acidic pH , but that condition can be partly overcome by methylation of the third strand cytosines ( 22 ) .
Stable R*RY type triplexes have been shown to form at physiological pH in the presence of divalent cations , where oligonucleotide interaction with double-stranded DNA involves G*G : C , A*A : T , or T*A : T triads with an antiparallel orientation of the third strand ( 21 ) .
TFO binding to the DNA duplex target appears to be highly sequence-specific , as triplex-forming oligos have been shown to recognize unique sites in the yeast chromosome ( 23 ) .
The human GM-CSF gene contains an enhancer located approximately 3 kilobases from the transcription start site ( 24 ) and a proximal promoter spanning at least the first 120 bp from the transcription initiation site ( 3 , 25 ) .
Activation of the human GM-CSF promoter in T cells appears to be tightly regulated by induction and binding of multiple transcription factors including NF- « B/Rel , AP-1 , and NFAT proteins ( 25-27 ) .
The GM-CSF promoter contains two binding sites for the NF- « B/Re ! l family of transcription factors , the CK-1 element , which binds only specific members of the family such as p65 ( Rel-A ) and c-Rel ( Rel ) , and the « B element that binds mainly classical NF- « B p65/p50 ( NF-kB1 ) complexes ( 26 , 27 ) .
The xB element appears to play a central role in the response of the GM-CSF promoter to T cell receptor type signals as well as HTLV-1 Tax activation in T-cells ( 25 , 27 ) Here we attempted to modulate transcription from the GM-CSF gene by DNA triple helix formation within the promoter region .
A triplex-forming oligodeoxynucleotide was targeted to a 15-bp purine-rich sequence that overlaps the « B-element .
Sequence specificity of the third strand coupling to its duplex target was investigated , as well as the ability of triplex formation to inhibit recombinant and nuclear NF- « B proteins binding to the GM-CSF promoter .
We also evaluated the effect of the triplex-forming oligomer on luciferase activity from GM-CSF promoter-driven reporter constructs and on endogenous GM-CSF mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels in activated Jukart T-cells and show that triplex formation can selectively suppress human GM-CSF gene expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotides and Plasmids-Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by the B-cyanocethylphosphoramidite method on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) using solid support for nonmodified oligomers or solid support coupled with 3'-amino-modifier ( Glen Research , Sterling , VA ) for oligomers with a propanolamine group at the 3 '' terminus .
Deprotected oligonucleotides were purified by preparative 12-20 % gel electrophoresis .
Concentrations were determined by absorption measurements at 260 nm using molar extinction coefficients .
Oligonucleotide sequences are presented in Fig .

The HTLV-1 tax expression plasmid ( pcTax ) used was a gift from Dr. Warner Greene ( Gladstone Institute , San Francisco , CA ) and has been previously described ( 28 ) .
The reporter construct pGMluc contains 620 bp of the GM-CSF promoter ( 27 ) .
The reporter plasmid pIL3luc , containing a 670-bp ( -550 to +120 ) polymerase chain reaction fragment of human IL-3 gene promoter made using AJ1-16 genomic clone ( 24 ) was provided by Dr. Peter Cockerill ( IMVS , Adelaide , S.A. , Australia ) .
Triplex Gel Shift Assays-Double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleo-tides were end-labeled with [ y- '' °PJATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase .
TFOs ( specific and control ) were heated at 65 °C for 5 min to prevent self-association and placed on ice .
Triplex formation was assessed by 14439 incubating for 2 h at 20 °C 0.2 ng of double-stranded probe with the indicated concentrations of TFOs ( see legend for Fig .
2 ) in 89 mM Tris borate ( pH 8.0 ) , 20 mM MgCl , , and 10 % sucrose followed by electrophoresis through a 12 % native acrylamide gel for 16 h at 4 °C .
Both gel and running buffer contained 89 mM Tris borate ( pH 8.0 ) and 20 mM MgCl , , .
DNase I Footprinting Analysis-The probe for DNase I footprinting was prepared by digesting the pGMluc plasmid with Sail , dephospho-rylated with alkaline phosphatase , and radiolabeling with [ y-*°P ] JATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase .
After a second digest with Mscl the 489-bp probe was purified on a 2 % agarose gel .
Triplex formation reactions were performed under the same conditions as described for the triplex band shift assays and were then digested with DNase I at a concentration of 1 unit/pl for 30 s. Digestion was stopped by adding 20 mM EDTA and 0.2 % SDS .
A + G chemical sequencing of the probe was carried out according to the Maxam-Gilbert method ( 29 ) .
Samples were then electrophoresed through 6 % denaturing gels , dried , and visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager .
Protein Binding Assay-Triplex formation was performed as described above using *°P-end-labeled double-stranded fragments of the GM-CSF gene promoter and immunoglobulin x gene enhancer ( see Fig .
1 ) .
After initial incubation for triplex formation of approximately 0.2 ng of the probe with specific or control single-stranded oligonucleotides as described above recombinant p65 ( 27 ) or nuclear extracts from transfected and stimulated Jurkat T cells ( prepared according to Ref .
30 ) were added , and samples were incubated for a further 30 min at 20 °C .
The composition of the protein binding buffer was 25 mM Tris ( pH 7.6 ) , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.5 mM EDTA , 60 mm NaCl , and 1 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) for the recombinant p65 .
Ten mM MgCl , was also present in the binding reaction for the nuclear proteins .
Electrophoresis was carried out on 5 % native polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25 x TBE buffer at 190 V for 90 min for samples with the recombinant p65 and 0.5 x TGE buffer at 150 V for 3 h using nuclear extracts .
Cell Culture and Transfection Procedure-The Jurkat T cell line was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and supplemented with L-glutamine and penicillin/gentamycin antibiotics .
Cells were transfected by electroporation at 270 V and a capacitance of 960 microfarads using a Bio-Rad gene pulser .
5 X 10° cells in 350 ul of RPMI containing 20 % fetal calf serum were used per transfection .
Ten ug of HTLV-1 tax expression vector and 5 ug of pGMluc or plL & lue reporter plasmid was used per transfection .
Twenty-four hours post-transfection , TFO GMS or control oligonucleotide GMc was added ( where indicated in the figure legends ) to the culture medium .
Cells were cultured for an additional 2 h , stimulated at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml PMA and 2 uM calcium ionophore , and harvested 8 h later .
Luciferase Reporter Assay and RNA Analysis-Cells used for the luciferase reporter assay were activated and exposed to oligonucleotides as described above and lysed by three freeze/thaw rounds 8 h after stimulation with PMA/Ca®* ionophore .
Three ug of total protein from the cell lysates was used per luciferase assay according to a procedure previously described ( 31 ) .
Light emission was measured using a scintillation counter with the coincidence circuit switched off .
Jurkat T cells were transfected , treated with oligonucleotides ( where indicated ) , and activated with PMA/Ca®* ionophore , as described above .
Total RNA was purified using guanidine isothiocyanate 8 h after cell stimulation .
The method for quantitating specific mRNA by RNase protection and the vectors for antisense RNA synthesis have been previously described ( 82 ) .
Ten pg of total RNA was used for each assay with °°P-labeled antisense probe .
Specific bands were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and normalized against glyc-eraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as internal control .
Assessment of the GM-CSF Protein Levels in the Culture Medium-The concentration of GM-CSF protein in the supernatants of the cell samples , used for RNase protection assay was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( Quantikine R & 0 Systems Inc. , Minne-apolis , MN ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The detection limit for this assay was 1.5 pg/ml .
RESULTS Oligonucleotide Design and Triplex Formation on the GM-CSF Promoter-It was previously shown that triple helix formation by oligonucleotides can inhibit DNA-protein interaction at specific regions by only overlapping and not spanning the entire protein binding site ( 16 ) .

lecular triple helix .
This sequence contains only one `` mismatch '' in an otherwise Pur : Pyr tract and is 72 % G-rich , properties that have been demonstrated to be essential for stable triplex formation .
A triplex-forming oligonucleotide GM3 ( Fig .
1b ) was designed according to the rules previously described in numerous studies ( 17 , 33-35 ) , i.e .
T opposite A : T pairs and G opposite G : C pairs with its orientation antiparallel to the purine strand of the underlying duplex target .
G was also put opposite the interrupting C : G pair , as it has been shown to be tolerated in this triplex motif ( 17 , 33 ) .
As a control , an oligomer GMe of random sequence of G and T residues with the same length as GM3 was used ( Fig .
1b ) .
The ability of these oligonucleotides to form triplexes was analyzed by gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting .
A radiolabeled 30-bp fragment of the GM-CSF promoter from -90 to -60 ( GM , Fig .
1b ) , which encompassed the TFO target and overlapping xB element , was incubated with increasing concentrations of the GM3 oligonucleotide in the presence of Mg** and subjected to electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels also containing Mg** followed by autoradiography .
Triplex formation was concentration-dependent ( Fig .
2 ) but occurred only at the higher concentrations of specific TFO and with apparent K , , > 10 um .
However no triplex formation was observed when control GMe oligonucleotide was incubated with GM even at the highest concentration ( Fig .
2 ) .
GM3 was also incubated with a control double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the « B element from the immunoglobulin « gene ( Igk ) , and no triplex formation was detected ( Fig .
2 ) .
To further confirm the selectivity and specificity of the GM3 TFO , a DNase I footprinting assay was performed .
Fig .

DNase I footprint analysis of the specificity of triplex formation on the GM-CSF promoter .
A 489-bp fragment of GM-CSF gene promoter , `` P-labeled at one end , was incubated with TFO GM3 or control oligonucleotide ( GMc at the concentrations indicated above each lane followed by DNase I digestion .
For the control DNase I digest , the promoter fragment was incubated in the absence of oligonucleotides under the same conditions ( Zane 2 ) .
A G + A Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reaction ( lane 1 ) was run beside DNase I digests to precisely map the DNase I footprint .
The target sequence for triplex formation by GM3 is indicated in brackets .
GM-CSF gene promoter .
The DNase I footprint occurred at 4 uM concentration of the specific TFO , and full protection was obtained at 16 um ( Fig .
3 , lanes 3 and 4 ) , which is consistent with the affinity of GM3 for its target duplex observed in the gel shift assay .
The nonspecific oligomer GMc did not allow any protection of the target from DNase I-mediated degradation even at a concentration of 20 um .
These data suggest that oligonucleotide GM3 forms a stable and sequence-selective triple helix with its double-stranded target from the GM-CSF gene proximal promoter .
Inhibition of Transcription Factor Binding by Triplex-forming Oligonucleotides-The effect of triplex formation by GM3 on the ability of NF- « B/Rel proteins to bind to the « B element within the 30-bp fragment of the GM-CSF promoter was examined by gel mobility shift assay .
The radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated in the absence or presence of increasing concentration of GM3 followed by incubation with recombinant p65 protein or nuclear extracts from HTLV-1 Tax-expressing Jurkat T cells .
The formation of the recombinant p65-DNA complex was inhibited by TFO GM3 in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig .

Effect of the triplex formation on recombinant ( 4 ) and nuclear ( B ) NF- « B protein binding to the GM-CSF gene promoter fragment containing the « B-element .
A , effect of the TFO GM3 on the binding to DNA of purified recombinant truncated p65 .
Arrows indicate the pG5-DNA complex and unbound free probes .
Mobility shift assays were carried out on native polyacrylamide gels using °P -labeled double-stranded DNA fragments from GM-CSF promoter ( GM ) and immunoglobulin k gene enhancer ( Igx ) containing the « B consensus sequence .
Double-stranded probes ( ~0.2 ng ) were preincubated alone or with oligonucleotides at the following concentrations : GM3 at 10 uM ( Zanes 4 and 10 ) , 3 , 1 , 0.3 , and 0.1 uM ( lanes 5-8 , respectively ) , and GMe at 10 uM ( Zane 9 ) followed by further incubation with recombinant p65 .
B , triplex formation by GM8 inhibits nuclear NF- « B protein binding to the DNA .
Nuclear extracts were isolated from nonstimulated ( N/S ) or HTLV-1 Tax expressing Jurkat T cells ( tax ) .
An arrow indicates the xB-like DNA-protein complex .
Mobility shift assays were performed as described above for the recombinant p65 , except that nuclear NF- « B proteins were used .
TFO and control oligomer were added to the double-stranded probes at the following concentrations : GM3 at 10 pM ( lane 5 ) , 3 , 1 , and 0.3 uM ( lanes 6-8 , respectively ) , and GMc at 10 uM ( Fane 9 ) The figure shows only the region of the gel containing inducible « B-like DNA-protein complex and some constitutive DNA-protein complexes with similar electrophoretic mobility .
Identification of specific DNA-NF- « B complexes was performed by competition with 20 ng of unlabeled Igx in both assays ( panel A , lane 2 , and panel B , lane 3 ) .
related oligomer that could not form a triplex did not have any significant effect on p65 interaction with the GM-CSF promoter fragment ( Fig .
40 , lane 9 ) .
p65 protein binding to the Igx control probe was not significantly affected by the GM3-specific oligonucleotide , used at the highest concentration ( Fig .
40 , lane 10 ) Jurkat T cells transfected with the HTLV-1 tax expression plasmid contain NF- « B/Rel complexes that can bind to the GM-CSF « B element ( Fig .
46 ) ( 27 ) .
The specific NF- « B complex was determined by competition with an excess of cold Igx oligomer containing the « kB consensus sequence ( Fig .
4b , lane 3 ) .
Several constitutive DNA-protein complexes were also detected under the conditions used ( Fig .

Effect of TFOs on the transcriptional activation from luciferase reporter constructs containing GM-CSF and IL-3 genes promoters .
pGMluc , pIL3luc , and expression plasmid pcTax have been described previously .
Five ug of reporter plasmid was co-transfected by electroporation into Jurkat T cells together with 10 ug of peTax .
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were treated with medium alone , GM3 , or GMc at the indicated concentrations .
Columns show relative levels of transcriptional induction upon stimulation from the luciferase reporter gene .
The reporter gene activities in transfected cells stimulated by overexpression of Tax and treated with only medium were assigned a value of 100 % .
Tax expression lead to an average of 250-fold induction for pGMIlue and 223-fold induction for plL & lue over the level in unstimulated cells .
Columns and error bars on the graph ( mean + S.E . )

dependent manner ( Fig .
45 , lanes 5-8 ) , whereas no effect was detected with control GMc oligomer at the highest concentration ( Fig .
4b , lane 9 ) .
These results indicate that triplex formation specifically prevents binding of NF- « B/Rel transcription factors ( either recombinant or nuclear proteins ) to the « B element of the GM-CSF gene promoter .
It is interesting to note that constitutive proteins binding to the GM fragment used as a probe in the gel retardation assay were also blocked by the related TFO but not by the control oligonucleotide ( Fig .
46 ) .
This fact could be viewed as additional evidence that the observed inhibition of NF- « B protein binding to the DNA probe was due to triplex formation at the targeted site and not TFO-NF- « B protein interactions .
Inhibition of Transcription from GM-CSF Promoter Reporter Constructs-It was shown previously ( 17 , 36 ) that short single-stranded oligonucleotides , when applied to the culture medium , can internalize into cells and equilibrate the concentration inside and outside the cell membrane within a few hours .
This phenomenon is not universal and varies depending on the cell type used in the experiment possibly as a consequence of different mechanisms of oligonucleotide uptake ( reviewed in Ref .
37 ) .
When Jurkat T cells were incubated with an intrinsically °°P-labeled oligonucleotide we also found that the intra-cellular concentration of the oligomer reached approximately 50 % of that in the culture medium after 2 h and approximately 80 % after 5 h of incubation ( data not shown ) .
To investigate the effect of triplex formation on GM-CSF gene transcription in cell culture , 3'-amino-derivatized ( specific and control ) oligomers were directly added to the culture medium at the indicated concentrations ( Fig .
5 ) .
3'-modification with a primary amino group has been shown to significantly increase the resistance of natural phosphodiester oligode- 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 14442 oxynucleotides to nuclease degradation ( 17 ) .
Two luciferase reporter constructs were used to analyze the ability of the TFO to inhibit inducible transcriptional activity in Jurkat T cells .
A 620-bp GM-CSF promoter reporter vector ( pGMluc ) containing the triplex target site and a plasmid with 670 bp of the IL-3 gene promoter ( pIL3luc ) , which does not have a sequence capable of forming a DNA triplex with GM3 , were transfected into Jurkat T cells together with an HTLV-1 tax expression vector .
Both IL-3 and GM-CSF promoter activities are induced by HTLV-1 Tax ( 38 ) .
After 24 h , TFO GM3 and control oligomer GMc were added to the culture medium at the concentrations shown in Fig .
5 , and cells were cultured for an additional 8 h and then harvested .
The specific triplex-forming oligonucleotide GM3 demonstrated a 65 % inhibition of the reporter gene activity from pGMluc at a concentration of 1 uM , whereas no effect was detected when cells transfected with pGMluc were treated with GMe at the same concentration of 1 um ( Fig .
5 ) .
Also no significant differences in luciferase activity induced by the IL-3 promoter were detected when cells transfected with pIL3luc were exposed to medium alone , GM3 , or GMc at the highest concentrations ( Fig .
5 ) Triplex Formation Inhibits Transcription from the Endogenous GM-CSF Gene-We used RNase protection assays to determine whether the GM3 oligonucleotide , targeted to form a triple helix within the GM-CSF promoter , would selectively suppress the induction of mRNA from the endogenous GM-CSF gene .
The effect on the response of the GM-CSF gene to PMA/ Ca** ionophore treatment and HTLV-1 Tax expression in combination with PMA/Ca®** ionophore was measured .
Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with HTLV-1 tax or untransfected were preincubated for 2 h with triplex-forming oligonucleotide GM3 or control oligomer GMe at the indicated concentrations ( Fig .
6 ) .
After stimulation for a further 7 h with PMA/Ca®** ionophore , total RNA was extracted and assayed .
GM-CSF mRNA levels in PMA/Ca®* ionophore-stimulated cells were significantly reduced when cells were treated with GM3 at 2.4 M concentration compared with samples exposed to the culture medium only or to the control GMc oligomer at the highest concentration .
( Fig .
6 ) .
GM3 was also effective when the expression of GM-CSF mRNA was synergistically activated by HTLV-1 Tax and PMA/Ca** ionophore2 ( Fig .
6 ) .
GM3 caused up to 70 % reduction of the GM-CSF mRNA level induced by PMA/Ca** ionophore and up to 50 % decrease after activation with HTLV-1 Tax and PMA/Ca** ionophore together ( Fig .
6 ) .
Concentrations of immunoreactive GM-CSF in the supernatants of cells stimulated with both stimuli and treated with GM3 , but not GMc , were also decreased by an average 45 % with the highest concentration of GM3 ( from an average 560 + 13 pg/ml ( mean + S.D . )
to an average 320 + 16 pg/ml in two experiments ) in accordance with mRNA levels in the cells .
In the same cell samples , concentrations of IL-3 mRNA were not affected either by TFO GM3 or by control GMc oligonucleotides regardless of the type of activation used ( Fig .

These results lead to the conclusion that a 3'-amino derivat-ized oligodeoxyribonucleotide , directed to form a triple helix with a 15-bp target sequence overlapping the NF- « B binding site in the GM-CSF promoter , significantly inhibits transcription from the endogenous gene in human T cells , and this inhibition appears to be oligomer- and gene-specific .

Triplex formation by GM3 affects expression from the endogenous GM-CSF gene in Jurkat T cells activated by different stimuli .
Untransfected Jurkat T cells or Jurkat T cells transfected with 10 ug of peTax were treated with specific TFO GM3 or control GMe at the indicated concentrations and stimulated with PMA/Ca®* ionophore .
Total cellular RNA was purified , and the levels of the mRNAs of interest were assessed by PhosphorImager quantitation of bands , obtained from mRNA protection by *°P-labeled antisense probes .
Glycer-aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels in each sample were used as an internal reference for normalizing GM-CSF and IL-3 mRNA concentrations .
The columns on the graph represent relative levels of GM-CSF and IL-3 mRNA in cells stimulated with PMA/Ca®* ionophore or HTLV-1 Tax together with PMA/Ca®* ionophore .
GM-CSF and IL-3 mRNA levels in cells stimulated and not treated with oligonucleotides were assigned a value of 100 % .
The error bars show standard deviations of the results obtained in two independent experiments .
human GM-CSF gene promoter and more importantly can reduce expression from the endogenous GM-CSF gene in Jurkat T cells .
Moreover , we show that GM-CSF protein concentrations in cell supernatants were reduced in parallel with the GM-CSF mRNA levels .
Although there are many reports of triplex formation inhibiting transcription from reporter gene constructs , only a few reports describe the inhibition of human endogenous gene expression in cell culture ( 17 , 40-42 ) .
The TFO binds to a sequence overlapping a « kB element and blocks in vitro protein binding to this site .
This is consistent with the previous mutation analysis of the GM-CSF promoter in our laboratory showing that this kB element is required for the response of the promoter to PMA/Ca** ionophore activation ( 25 ) and to transactivation by the HTLV-1 Tax protein ( 27 ) in reporter gene assays .
The data presented here confirm these results for the endogenous gene .
Activation of the GM-CSF gene by PMA/Ca®* ionophore is also mediated via NFAT/AP-1 binding sites in both the promoter and enhancer ( 25 , 43 ) .
HTLV-1 Tax , on the other hand , requires the « B element as well as the adjacent CK-1 element for promoter induction but does not activate NFAT/AP-1 sites ( 27 ) . ''
The fact that the GM3 TFO inhibits the response of the endogenous gene to both PMA/Ca** ionophore and Tax/PMA/Ca** ionophore costimulation suggests a central role for this kB element in GM-CSF gene transcriptional activation .
610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Repression of GM-CSF Transcription by DNA Triple Helix The effect of the TFO GM3 appears to be specific for the GM-CSF gene and has no effect on a reporter construct containing the IL-3 promoter or on mRNA levels from the endogenous IL-3 gene .
The gene for IL-3 responds to the same stimuli as GM-CSF in T cells ( 38 , 44 ) .
This implies that the TFO is not blocking NF- « B or other transcription factor function in general but is acting selectively through triplex formation on the GM-CSF promoter .
It is also worth noting that the GM3-targeted DNA sequence covers a G/C element ( see Fig .
1 ) that represents a putative Sp1 binding site .
The Sp1 protein has been implicated in the transcriptional activation of numerous genes , and the Sp1 site was found to be important in the expression of murine GM-CSF ( 45 ) .
The G/C region of the human gene has a 2-bp difference with the functional site in mouse and appears to be a weak Sp1 binding site . ''
However , blocking of Sp1 binding to the GM-CSF promoter by the TFO may also contribute to the observed inhibitory effect of GMB3 on the expression of the gene .
We have also shown that the GM3 oligonucleotide caused a slightly greater decrease in the GM-CSF mRNA levels in Jurkat T cells induced by PMA/Ca** ionophore than in cells activated by both PMA/Ca®* ionophore and the HTLV-1 transac-tivator Tax .
Costimulation of GM-CSF expression by these two stimuli has been shown to have a strong synergistic effect leading to high levels of gene transcription . ''
The overexpression of Tax significantly increases binding of NF- « B/Rel transcription factors to the « B element in the GM-CSF promoter compared with that seen with PMA/Ca** ionophore , '' which may make it more difficult for the TFO to compete with proteins for binding to the target site .
In addition , NFAT/AP-1 sites and the CK-1 element all contribute to this high level of synergism , and it may by more difficult to block gene activation via a single site .
In order to achieve complete inhibition of GM-CSF transcription it may be necessary to use TFOs that block not only the « B element but also NFAT/AP-1 sites in the gene enhancer or promoter since we have shown that all of these elements are required for full activation of the gene ( 25 , 27 , 43 ) .
It may be also possible to increase the affinity of TFO binding to the target site on the GM-CSF promoter .
This may be achieved by using , for instance , oligonucleotides coupled to an intercalating agent ( 46 , 47 ) or an oligomer that is linker-substituted at the position of the `` mismatch '' in the duplex target ( 48 ) .
The observed relatively high K , , ( > 10 um ) of the GM3 oligonucleotide binding to its duplex target could be due to the one mismatch in the otherwise homopurine-homopyrimidine sequence of the double-stranded DNA .
Pyrimidine interruptions in the purine tract of the targeted DNA sequence have been shown to be significantly unfavorable for triplex formation because of loss of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding ( 21 ) and can increase the value of the relative binding affinity of the third strand by approximately 1 order of magnitude ( 49 ) .
The central location of the interruption in the purine sequence of the du-plex , as seen in the target on the GM-CSF promoter , has been also found to cause greater distortion in the stability of the DNA triplex than the same mismatch situated at the end of the targeted site ( 49 , 50 ) .
Another factor that may contribute to the relatively low affinity of GM3 for its target DNA is the stretch of eight consecutive guanines in the TFO , which makes this oligonucleotide highly susceptible to self-aggregation through the formation of G-tetrades ( 51 , 52 ) .
It also should be noted that some degradation of the triplex may occur during the course of electrophoresis , thus increasing the value of the K ) , observed .
In a number of previous studies it has been noted that the *P. Cockerill , personal communication .
14448 extracellular concentration of the TFO required for inhibition of target gene transcription in intact cells was in the range of 10-25 um ( 17 , 18 , 40 ) , which was 10-50 times the dissociation constant for triplex formation in vitro .
The data presented in this study are not consistent with these observations .
A significant decrease of GM-CSF mRNA levels by GM3 was achieved at a concentration of 2.4 um of the TFO in the culture medium , which was below the K ; , value observed in the binding gel shift assays .
This may be attributed to the intrinsic properties of the GM3 oligonucleotide sequence .
But this finding may also be explained by the possible changes in the chromatin structure upon activation of the inducible GM-CSF gene that could make the target duplex in the gene promoter more easily accessible for the exogenous oligonucleotide and thus promote more efficient triplex formation by GM3 .
50-70 % of cases of acute myeloid leukemia have been shown to depend on GM-CSF for proliferation both in vitro ( 8 ) and in vivo ( 9 ) and also for engraftment into SCID mice ( 53 ) .
A specific antagonist of GM-CSF/receptor interactions can block the growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro ( 54 ) , as can antibodies against GM-CSF ( 55 ) and its receptor ( 56 ) .
It has been suggested , in fact , that paracrine production of GM-CSF is responsible for progression of the disease ( 57 ) .
Furthermore , 20-30 % of acute myeloid leukemia cases constitutively produce and respond to GM-CSF ( 39 , 58 , 59 ) , suggesting that it can also act in an autocrine manner .
The GM3 TFO may , therefore , have a potential therapeutic role in blocking either the paracrine or autocrine production of GM-CSF in cases of acute myeloid leukemia .
The detection of GM-CSF mRNA in the bronchoalveolar lavage of atopic patients and GM-CSF protein in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients ( 4 , 5 ) suggests another role for the therapeutic use of TFOs that block GM-CSF transcription .
