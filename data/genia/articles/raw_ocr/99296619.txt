The GTPase Rho is known to mediate the assembly of integrin-containing focal adhesions and actin stress fibers .
Here , we investigate the role of Rho in regulating the distribution of the monocyte-binding receptors E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 in human endothelial cells .
Inhibition of Rho activity with C3 transferase or N19RhoA , a dominant negative RhoA mutant , reduced the adhesion of monocytes to activated endothelial cells and inhibited their spreading .
Similar effects were observed after pretreatment of endothelial cells with cytochalasin D. In contrast , dominant negative Rac and Cdc42 proteins did not affect monocyte adhesion or spreading .
C3 transferase and cytochalasin D did not alter the expression levels of monocyte-binding receptors on endothelial cells , but did inhibit clustering of E-selectin , ICA M-1 , and VCAM-1 on the cell surface induced by monocyte adhesion or cross-linking antibodies .
Similarly , inhibited receptor clustering .
Monocyte adhesion and receptor cross-linking induced stress fiber assembly , and inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase prevented this response but did not affect receptor clustering .
Fi-nally , receptor clusters colocalized with ezrin/moesin/ radixin proteins .
These results suggest that Rho is required in endothelial cells for the assembly of stable adhesions with monocytes via the clustering of monocyte-binding receptors and their association with the actin cytoskeleton , independent of stress fiber formation .

Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells can be significantly upregulated by activating the endothelium with inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor « ( TNF-a ) , interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , and IL-4 ( Raines and Ross , 1996 ) .
Activated endothelial cells express several monocyte-binding proteins including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , ICAM-2 , and THE adhesion of monocytes to the vascular endo- Address correspondence to Beata Wojciak-Stothard , Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , 91 Riding House Street , London W1P 8BT , United Kingdom .

E-Selectin mediates the initial steps of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells , a process described as leukocyte rolling ( Hogg and Landis , 1993 ; Rice et al. , 1996 ) .
It is absent in unstimulated endothelial cells and is rapidly expressed de novo in response to inflammatory cytokines reaching a peak concentration after ~4 h of stimulation ( Bevilacqua et al. , 1987 ; Bevilacqua and Nelson , 1993 ; Rice et al. , 1996 ) .
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are required for stable adhesion , subsequent spreading , and diapedesis of leukocytes through endothelium ( Bevilacqua and Nelson , 1993 ; Luscinskas et al. , 1996 ) .
Although the expression kinetics of these three molecules have been studied extensively , the signaling mechanisms leading to the formation of stable adhesions between endothelial cells and leukocytes are still poorly understood .
The interactions between intracellular cytoskeletal components and cell surface adhesion molecules have been studied extensively because of their potential impact on cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion as well as receptor internalization ( Pavalko and Otey , 1994 ) .
The best charac- 1293 terized model for the association of integral membrane proteins with the actin cytoskeleton is the focal adhesion , found in places of integrin-mediated cell attachment to the extracellular matrix ( Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka , 1996 ; Hemler , 1998 ) .
Two of the leukocyte-binding receptors on endothelial cells , E-selectin and ICAM-1 , have also been reported to associate with components of the actin cytoskeleton ( Carpen et al. , 1992 ; Yoshida et al. , 1996 ) .
Clustering of E-selectin after leukocyte binding was observed on IL-l-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , and the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin was found to interact with a number of actin-associated proteins , including a-actinin , vinculin , filamin , paxillin , and focal adhesion kinase ( Yoshida et al. , 1996 ) .
The association of E-selectin with the cytoskeleton increased the mechanical resistance of clustered E-selectin to shear stress .
Based on these observations , it was postulated that the transmembrane anchoring of a cluster of E-selectin molecules could serve as a physical nidus for counteraction during the spreading and migration of leukocytes to intercellular junctions that follows their stable arrest .
In addition , the intracellular signals transmitted to the cytoskeleton during E-selectin clustering could influence the function of other endothelial adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 ( Yoshida et al. , 1996 ) .
Interestingly , ICAM-1 can associate via its cytoplasmic domain with a-actinin , an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein ( Carpen et al. , 1992 ) .
Similar associations were also observed with the adhesion proteins , ICAM-2 , L-selectin , and Bl and B2 integrins ( Heiska et al. , 1996 , 1998 ) .
The functional implications of this binding have not been fully elucidated but it may be that a cytoskeletal anchorage which immobilizes ICAM-1 on endothelial cells could provide a firm adhesive substratum for migrating leukocytes ( Carpen et al. , 1992 ) .
The three small GTP-binding proteins , Cdc42 , Rac , and Rho , are key mediators of actin cytoskeletal remodeling induced by extracellular signals and also regulate the formation of cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesions ( Ridley , 1996 ; van Aelst and D'Souza-Schory , 1997 ) .
In particu-lar , Rho is responsible for the formation and maintenance of integrin-containing focal adhesions ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) , whereas Rac and Cdc42 mediate the assembly of smaller adhesive complexes associated with lamellipodia and filopodia ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) .
The observation that E-selectin and ICA M-1 associate with components of the actin cytoskeleton suggested that Rho family proteins could be involved in regulating adhesion mediated by these receptors .
Therefore , we have investigated the roles of these proteins in regulating monocyte binding to TNF- « -activated human endothelial cells and clustering of the monocyte-binding receptors , E-selectin , ICA M-1 , and VCAM-1 .
We have found that Rho but not Rac or Cdc42 is required for the initiation and maintenance of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells .
In addition , Rho regulates receptor clustering , most likely by mediating linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to the membrane receptors .
Clustering of membrane receptors is independent of the activity of the myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) and stress fibers , and is therefore clearly different from the clustering of integrins in focal contacts ( Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) .

Cell Culture HUVECs were a kind gift from Ruggero Pardi ( Milano , Italy ) .
The cells were cultured in TC Nunclon flasks coated with 10 pg/ml human fibronectin in medium 199 modified Earle 's salt solution containing 1.25 g/liter NaHCO ; and Glutamax and supplemented with 20 % FCS , 100 pg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement , 1 % Nutridoma NS , and 100 jig/ml hep-arin .
Cells were cultured at 37°C in humidified air containing 5 % CO ; .
For experiments cells were used between 3 and 7 passages .
MMVE-tsLT cells ( kindly provided by Catherine Clarke , London , UK ) were human mammary microvascular endothelial cells expressing a tem-perature-sensitive SV-40 large T antigen to extend their life span in cul-ture .
MMVE-tsLT cells were cultured in EGM-2 medium and used for experiments up to 15 passages .
For microinjection experiments cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with 10 pg/ml human fibronectin until confluent .
Glass coverslips were marked with a cross using a diamond pen to facilitate the localization of microinjected cells .
To obtain quiescent cells , the culture medium was replaced by medium containing 10 % FCS but no heparin or other growth factors .
Cells were incubated in this medium for 72 h and tested for DNA synthesis by incubation with 10 M BrdU for 24 h. The cells that had incorporated BrdU were visualized as described previously ( Wéjciak-Stothard et al. , 1998 ) .
Over 97 % of cells were quiescent and did not incorporate BrdU .
Isolation of Peripheral Blood Monocytes Single donor platetephoresis residues were purchased from the North London Blood Transfusion Service .
Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation ( specific density , 1.077 g/ml ) preceding monocyte separation in a Beckman JE6 elutriator .
Monocyte purity was assessed by flow cytometry using directly conjugated anti-CD45 and anti-CD14 antibodies and was routinely > 85 % .
All media and sera were routinely tested for endotoxin using the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate test and rejected if the endotoxin concentration exceeded 0.1 U/ml .
Measurement of Monocyte Adhesion and Spreading To activate endothelial cells , TNF- @ was added at 100 ng/ml for 4 or 24 h. Cell viability was tested after treatment with TNF-a by a trypan blue exclusion test .
A fter 4 h endothelial cells were washed four times in culture 1294 medium to remove TNF- « and then purified human monocytes were added at 5 X 10° cells/ml and incubated for a further 2 h before fixation .
The monocyte/endothelial cell ratio in cocultures was 3.2 + 0.2 .
Where indicated , cytochalasin D at 0.05 ug/ml was added to cell cultures 3 h after addition of TNF- @ and incubated for 1 h. C3 transferase was added to culture medium at 15 jig/ml 1 h after the addition of TNF- @ and incubated together with TNF- @ for a further 3 h. To determine the contribution of each monocyte-binding receptor to monocyte adhesion , endothelial cells were incubated for 1 h with function-blocking antibodies against E-selectin , P-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 at 10 jug/ml before the addition of monocytes .
The number of adherent monocytes and monocyte spread area was determined using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( MRC500 ; Bio-Rad ) .
To determine changes in the spread area of monocytes , images of the basal aspect of the cells were collected and the area was measured using the software integrated to the MRC500 ( SOM , version 6.42 a ) against a Geller MRS-2 magnification reference standard 131 R3 ( Agar Scientific Ltd. ) .
To estimate the extent of monocyte adhesion , the number of monocytes bound per endothelial cell was calculated .
Cell cultures were stained for F-actin with TRITC-phalloidin and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-CD 14 ( SH-M1 ) antibody diluted 1:100 and FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:100 in order to facilitate identification of the adherent monocytes .
In each experiment > 500 endothelial cells were scored to calculate monocyte adhesion , and experiments were performed in triplicate .
In some experiments endothelial cells were stained for E- and P-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 as described below .
Introduction of Recombinant Proteins into Endothelial Cells The recombinant proteins , V14RhoA , N17Racl , N17Cdc42 , and C3 transferase , were expressed in Escherichia coli from the pGEX-2T vector as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified as described previously ( Ridley et al. , 1992 ) .
Protein concentrations were estimated using a protein assay kit ( Bio-Rad ) .
Proteins were microinjected into the cytoplasm of quiescent HUVECs 3.5 h after stimulation with TNF- @ .
After a 15-min incubation , the cells were washed four times in culture medium and monocytes were added to endothelial cell cultures .
To identify injected cells , tetramethylrhodamine dextran ( molecular weight of 10,000 ) at 5 mg/ml was microinjected together with recombinant proteins .
C3 transferase was microinjected at a concentration of 4 ug/ml , V14RhoA was microinjected at ~100 ug/ml , N17Racl at 7 mg/ml , and N17Cdc42 at 2 mg/ml .
In experiments involving receptor clustering C3 transferase was added to the culture medium at 15 g/ml , 1 h after the addition of TNF-a , and incubated together with TNF-u for a further 3 h. To express N19RhoA , an expression vector containing myc epitope-tagged N19RhoA cDNA ( pcDNA3-N19RhoA ) was microinjected at 0.05 mg/ml together with tetramethylrhodamine dextran into cell nuclei at the same time as the addition of TNF- @ , and cells were incubated for a further 3 h before adding antibodies to induce receptor clustering or for 4 h before assaying monocyte adhesion .
Cells expressing N19RhoA were identified with the mouse monoclonal anti-mye epitope antibody 9E10 and FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody : 84 % + 10 % of microinjected cells expressed detectable levels of N19RhoA .
Receptor Clustering , Immunofluorescence , and Affinity Fluorescence To induce receptor clustering , TNF- « @ was added to endothelial cells and then after 3 h mouse monoclonal antibodies to E-selectin , ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , HLA class I antigen , or CD58/LFA-3 were added to cells at a final concentration of 10 g/ml and incubated for 1 h at 37°C .
The mouse monoclonal anti-human E/P-selectin antibody used here recognizes both E- and P-selectin on the surface of endothelial cells .
Using mouse monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognized only E- or P-selectin , we determined that TNF- @ -activated HUVECs expressed predominantly E-selectin and only very low levels of P-selectin , and therefore the results obtained with the anti-E/P-selectin antibody relate to E-selectin .
A fter incubation with primary antibodies , TNF- « and the primary antibodies were removed from the cell medium and 10 jig/ml of FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was added to the cells for 30 min .
Cells were then washed three times in PBS , fixed with 4 % formaldehyde dissolved in PBS for 10 min at room temperature , permeabilized for 6 min with 0.2 % Triton X-100 , and then incubated with 1 ug/ml TRITC-phalloidin for 45 Wojciak-Stothard et al .

To examine the extent of spontaneous receptor clustering upon the addition of the primary antibodies only , TNF-o-stimulated HUVECs were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies as described above , and then fixed .
Fixed cells were then incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min , washed , permeabilized , and stained for actin filaments .
For controls , nonstimulated HUVECs or HUVECs that were stimulated with TNF-a for 4 h were used .
The cells were then fixed , incubated with primary and secondary antibodies , and then permeabilized and stained for actin as described above .
In experiments with MLCK inhibitors , ML-7 ( 40 uM ) and 2,3-butanedione 2-monoxime ( BDM ) ( 5 mM ) were added to cell cultures together with the primary antibody , 3 h after stimulation with TNF- @ .
A fter a 1-h incubation , the cells were washed as described before , and the inhibitors were added again together with the secondary antibody and incubated for 30 min .
The cells were then washed , fixed , and stained for actin filaments as described above .
Confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out with an LSM 310 or 510 ( Zeiss ) mounted over an infinity corrected Axioplan microscope ( Zeiss ) fitted with a X10 eyepiece , using either a X40 NA 1.3 or a X63 NA 1.4 oil immersion objective .
Image files were collected as a matrix of 1024 X 1024 pixels describing the average of 8 frames scanned at 0.062 Hz where FITC and TRITC were excited at 488 nm and 543 nm and visualized with a 540 + 25 and a 608 + 32 nm bandpass filters , respectively , where the levels of interchannel cross-talk were insignificant .
Cell Surface Immunoassay To measure the cell surface expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 we used an ELISA assay as described by Zund et al .
( 1996 ) with some modifications .
In brief , HUVECs were plated onto fibronectin-coated 96-well polystyrene plates at a density of 2 X 10° cells/well and grown for 48 h. The cells were then incubated in starvation medium ( 10 % FCS ) for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with TNF- @ for 4 or 24 h and , where indicated , cytochalasin D at 0.05 jig/ml was added to cell cultures 3 or 23 h after addition of TNF- « and incubated for 1 h. C3 transferase was added to the culture medium at 15 pg/ml either 1 or 21 h after the addition of TNF-a and incubated together with TNF- @ for a further 3 h. In controls , C3 transferase and cytochalasin D were added to nonstimulated cells .
Cells were washed three times in PBS and then fixed in 1 % paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 15 min .
The cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated overnight with 1 % BSA solution in PBS at 4°C .
All wells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 200 pl/well of 0.5 % BSA solution containing 5 g/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-human E/P-selectin antibody , mouse monoclonal anti-human ICAM-1 antibody or goat anti-human VCAM-1 antibody .
Subsequently , cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 200 ul of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG or donkey HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG solution at 1:1,000 in 0.5 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature .
After washing , plates were developed by addition of peroxidase substrate , 2,2'-azino-bis ( 3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulphonic acid ) and OD at 650 nm was determined on a microtiter plate spectropho-tometer .
Data are presented as mean + SD ( background subtracted ) .
Western Blotting HUVECs were grown to confluence in 40-mm plastic petri dishes pre-coated with human fibronectin and starved for 24 h in 10 % FCS as described above .
TNF- « was added as indicated and incubated with cells for 4 or 24 h. Cytochalasin D and C3 transferase were added as described above ( cell surface immunoassay ) .
Cells were washed , lysed , and debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm .
The protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay .
Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 % polyacrylamide gels under nonre-ducing conditions , and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , which then were blocked overnight with 5 % nonfat dry milk powder in TBS ( 20 mM Tris-HC ] , pH 7.6 , 137 mM NaC1 ) containing 0.05 % Tween 20 .
This was followed by incubation with anti-E/P-selectin , mouse monoclonal anti-ICAM-1 , or goat anti-VCAM-1 antibodies diluted 1:500 in TBS-Tween containing 1 % dried milk powder for 2 h. Blots were then washed three times in TBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibodies diluted 1:2,000 .
Membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( Amersham International ) .
1295 Results C3 Transferase and Cytochalasin D Inhibit Monocyte Adhesion and Spreading on Endothelial Cells Human monocytes showed low levels of adhesion to unstimulated , quiescent HUVECs ( Fig .
1 a ) .
The few adherent cells retained a regular , rounded morphology similar to that observed in a suspension of freshly isolated monocytes ( Fig .
2 a ) .
Monocyte adhesion increased sevenfold after stimulation of endothelial cells with TNF-a ( Figs .
1 a and 2 c ) .
To determine whether Rho in endothelial cells plays a role in monocyte adhesion , we treated cells with C3 transferase , an exoenzyme produced by Clostridium botulinum which inhibits Rho by ADP ribosylation ( von Eichel-Streiber et al. , 1996 ) .
The TNF- « -induced increase in monocyte adhesion was reduced by 55 % in HUVECs incubated with C3 transferase ( Fig .
1 a ) .
Monocyte adhesion was also inhibited in TNF-o-stimulated HUVECs which were microinjected with C3 transferase 30 min before the addition of monocytes ( Fig .
2 d ) .
Under the conditions used here , C3 transferase induced loss of stress fibers but did not induce cell rounding ( Fig .
2 d ) .
To provide further evidence for the involvement of Rho in monocyte adhesion , HUVECs were microinjected with a plasmid encoding N19RhoA , a dominant negative RhoA protein .
In cells expressing N19RhoA , monocyte adhesion was reduced by 75 % compared with control-injected cells ( Fig .
1 a ) .
As Rho is known to induce actin reorganization , we specifically investigated the involvement of the endothelial cell actin cytoskeleton in monocyte adhesion by pretreat- 3 x 0.4 = `` la b © 2 © S , 2 o o C o E Laud 1 g ** * % 0 m 0 TNF-q = - 4 40 404+ + +0 +0 + additions ~ ~ C3 CD DX Rho NRe NCd N19 hi __ 300 400 ol = 3 a 300 ( £200 a @ 200 3 o 100 5 100 E TNF-a0 0 additions - - C3 CD The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 ing endothelial cells with cytochalasin D before addition of monocytes .
Cytochalasin D inhibits addition of actin monomers to the barbed ends of actin filaments ( Cooper , 1987 ) , and as expected it induced a decrease in actin cables in HUVECs ( see Fig .
7 i ) .
It was necessary to wash out cytochalasin D from the medium before addition of monocytes , to prevent it acting on the monocytes .
Control experiments showed that although the effects of cytochalasin D on the actin cytoskeleton of HUVECs were reversible , few actin cables reappeared during the 2-h incubation with monocytes .
By 4 h after cytochalasin D removal , however , the actin cytoskeleton was essentially indistinguishable from that of untreated cells ( data not shown ) .
Monocyte adhesion was substantially inhibited in HUVECs pre-treated with cytochalasin D ( Fig .
1 a ) , indicating that the actin cytoskeleton in endothelial cells is important for promoting monocyte adhesion .
Monocytes attached to TNF-a-treated HUVECs showed an approximately twofold increase in their spread area relative to monocytes on unstimulated endothelial cells ( Fig .
1 c ) .
Many monocytes become elongated and extended lamellipodia , characteristic of a migratory phenotype ( Fig .
2 , c and e ) .
The few monocytes that did attach to C3 trans-ferase- or cytochalasin D-treated activated HUVECs did not spread significantly ( Fig .
1 c ) .
As with HUVECs , adhesion of monocytes to nonacti-vated MMVE-tsLT cells was low and adherent monocytes remained rounded and unspread ( Fig .
1 , b and d , and Fig .
2 by .
The addition of TNF-a to MMVE-tsLT cells increased the number of adherent monocytes fivefold ( Fig .
1 b ) .
This effect was almost completely inhibited by the ad Figure 1 .
Rho but not Rac or Cdcd42 are required for the adhesion and spreading of monocytes on TNF-a-activated endothelial cells .
Where indicated , endothelial cells were activated with TNF- @ for 4 h. During this incubation time , cells were treated with C3 transferase ( C3 ) for 3 h ; cytochalasin D ( CD ) for 1 h ; microin- ** ** jected with V14RhoA ( Rho ) , N17Rac ( NRe ) , N17Cdcd42 ( NCd ) , or fluorescent dextran ( DX ) 3.5 h after TNF- @ + + addition ; or - microinjected - with os cp pcDNA ( N19 ) immedi- ately after TNF- « addition .

2 , e and f ) .
Similar to HUVECs , the treatment of MMVE-tsLT cells with C3 transferase or cytochalasin D inhibited monocyte spreading on endothelial cells ( Fig .
1 d ) .
As these results indicate that endothelial cell Rho is involved in regulating monocyte adhesion , we investigated whether the related proteins , Rac and Cdc42 , also affect this process .
Microinjection of TNF-o-activated HUVECs with dominant inhibitory Rac or Cdc42 protein , N17Racl or N17Cdc42 , did not significantly change monocyte adhesion or spreading ( Figs .
1 a and 3 a ) .
The N17Cdc42 and N17Racl protein preparations were active as they were able to inhibit the formation of stress fibers in TNF- « -activated HUVECs ( see Wojciak-Stothard et al. , 1998 ) .
We conclude that Rho but not Rac or Cdc42 in endothelial cells is involved in the formation and maintenance of intercellular adhesions between monocytes and endothelial cells .

Monocytes were incubated for 2 h with control , unstimulated HUVECs ( a ) , control , unstimulated MMVE-tsLT cells ( b ) , TNF- « -activated HUVECs ( c ) , and C3 trans-ferase-microinjected HUVECs activated with TNF- @ « for 4 h ( d ) ( the arrow points to the area of microinjected cells ) ; TNF-o-activated MMVE-tsLT cells ( e ) ; and C3 transferase-micro-injected TNF- « -activated MMVE-tsLT cells ( f ) .
Cells were then fixed and stained with FITC-phalloidin to show F-actin .
The image in g corresponds to f and shows TRITC-dextran , which was coinjected with C3 transferase to visualize the injected cells .
Bar , 10 m. VI4RhoA Increases the Attachment of Monocytes to Endothelial Cells As our results indicate that Rho is required in endothelial cells for monocyte adhesion , we investigated the effects of introducing activated Rho into endothelial cells .
Microinjection of constitutively activated Rho protein , V14RhoA , into quiescent , unstimulated cells did not enhance monocyte adhesion ( Fig .
1 a ) , whereas in HUVECs VI4RhoA induced a small but significant increase in monocyte adhesion ( Fig .
1 a ) .
Monocytes tended to form clusters around the cells microinjected with V14RhoA ( Fig .
3 c ) .
This was not a nonspecific consequence of microinjection because injection of fluorescent dextran into TNF- « -activated endothelial cells did not have a significant effect on monocyte adhesion ( Fig .
1 a ) .
These results provide further evidence for a role of Rho in promoting monocyte adhesion .
1297 E-Selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 Are Major Monocyte-binding Receptors in TNF- « -activated HUVECs To investigate how Rho regulates monocyte adhesion and spreading , we first determined the involvement of different receptors for monocytes in mediating monocyte adhesion to TNF-a « -activated monocytes .
We focused specifically on E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 , as these are the three major monocyte-binding receptors on HUVECs known to be upregulated by TNF- « ( Luscinskas et al. , 1996 ; May et al. , 1996 ; Schleiffenbaum and Fehr , 1996 ; Melrose et al. , 1998 ) .
As expected from previous studies ( Beekhuizen and van Furth , 1993 ; Luscinskas et al. , 1996 ; May et al. , 1996 ) , quiescent endothelial cells showed very low surface expression levels of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 ( Fig .
4 , a , e , and g ) .
TNF -a @ increased the surface expression of these three proteins by 4 h after stimulation ( Fig .

Anti-P-selectin antibodies did not significantly reduce monocyte adhesion , reflecting the low level of P-selectin expression in HUVECs ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Inclusion of all four antibodies against E-selectin , P-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 inhibited monocyte adhesion by 61 % + 12 % .
Similar results with adhesion-blocking antibodies carried out in stationary ( nonflow ) conditions have been reported previously ( Luscinskas et al. , 1996 ) .
These results indicate that E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 are major monocyte-binding receptors on TNF- « -activated HUVECs , although this does not rule out a contribution of other receptors such as ICAM-2 , CD31/PECAM-1 , or « vB3 in monocyte-endothelial cell interactions ( Schleiffenbaum and Fehr , 1996 ; Brown , 1997 ) .
C3 Transferase and Cytochalasin D Do Not Alter the Expression Levels of E-Selectin , ICAM-1 , or VCAM-1 One possible explanation for the decreased binding of monocytes to endothelial cells treated with C3 transferase or cytochalasin D is that there are lower levels of monocyte-binding receptors on the cell surface .
To investigate this possibility , a cell surface immunoassay was performed on fixed monolayers of TNF- « -activated HUVECs ( Fig .
5 ) .
Endothelial cells were stimulated with TNF- « for 4 or 24 h either with or without addition of C3 transferase for the last 3 h or cytochalasin D for 1 h before fixation .
Analysis of receptor levels by ELISA showed that neither C3 transferase nor cytochalasin D induced any significant changes in the surface expression of E-selectin ( Fig .

Monocyte Adhesion Induces Rho-mediated Changes in the Distribution of E-Selectin , ICA M-1 , and VCAM-1 in HUVECs Clustering of E-selectin in endothelial cells has been postulated to be an initial step leading to the linkage of receptors to the cytoskeleton and stabilization of cell adhesion ( Yoshida et al. , 1996 ) .
We observed an accumulation of E-selectin on the surface of activated HUVECs around the margin of adhering monocytes ( Fig .

Cells were then fixed and the surface expression levels of E-selectin ( a ) , ICAM-1 ( b ) , and VCAM-1 ( c ) were determined by ELISA assay .
All results are expressed as means + 1 SD , and the unpaired Student 's £ test was used to compare differences between groups ( r = 4 ) .
The differences in surface expression of receptors in activated HUVECs compared with C3- or CD -treated activated HUVECs were statistically insignificant ( P > 0.1 ) .

The position of adhering monocytes was determined by F-actin staining ( Fig .
6 a ) .
ICAM-1 also accumulated along the margin of attached monocytes outlining fine protrusions formed by the monocyte membrane ( Fig .
6 , c and d ) .
In contrast , VCAM-1 did not significantly change its distribution upon the adhesion of monocytes .
Clustering of receptors was seen only in a few places where monocytes were attached and the positions of clusters were unrelated to monocyte margins ( Fig .
6 , e and f ) .
In endothelial cells 1299 that were treated with C3 transferase , E-selectin accumulation ( Fig .
6 , g and h ) and clustering of ICAM-1 ( Fig .
6 , i and j ) at the margin of the few adhering monocytes were much reduced .
This lack of clustering could be a consequence of weaker monocyte adhesion which is unable to signal sufficiently to induce clustering , or represent a requirement for Rho in the process of clustering , which in turn is required for stable adhesion .
C3 Transferase and Cytochalasin D Inhibit Clustering of Monocyte-binding Receptors on HUVECs We have shown that although C3 transferase and cytochalasin D did not change the expression levels of monocyte-binding receptors , they inhibited the binding and spreading of monocytes on endothelial cells and inhibited receptor clustering around the adherent monocytes .
To investigate further the role of Rho in regulating receptor clustering we mimicked clustering induced by adhering monocytes by incubating HUVECs with primary antibodies against E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 and then cross-linking them with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody .
This technique of clustering membrane receptors with specific antibodies has been described previously The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 Figure 6 .

Treatment of TNF- « -activated HUVECs with antibodies against E/P -selectin induced spontaneous clustering of E-selectin ( Fig .
7 a ) which was enhanced by the addition of secondary , cross-linking antibodies ( Fig .

Clustering of E-selectin with primary antibodies alone or with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies was significantly reduced by the treatment of endothelial cells with C3 transferase ( Fig .

7 , h and j ) .
Both C3 transferase and cytochalasin D also inhibited stress fiber formation , but under the conditions used did not induce cell rounding or detachment ( Fig .
7 , c , g , and i ) .
ICAM-1 in TNF- « -treated HUVECs incubated with only the primary antibody was localized mainly in the intercellular junctions ( Fig .
8 a ) .
Addition of secondary ( cross-linking ) antibodies caused a disappearance of ICAM-1 from the junctions and clustering of the receptors on the cell surface ( Fig .
8 b ) .
This was not a consequence of loss of intercellular junctions , as VE-cadherin localization to junctions was not altered by ICAM-1 cross-linking ( data not shown ) .
C3 transferase significantly inhibited antibody-induced clustering of ICAM-1 on the cell surface 1300 ( Fig .

It also reduced the localization of ICAM-1 to cell junctions , although again VE-cadherin localization was not altered ( data not shown ) .
Expression of dominant negative N19RhoA protein in endothelial cells also inhibited antibody-induced ICAM-1 clustering ( Fig .

C3 transferase inhibited the formation of stress fibers induced by the use of cross-linking antibodies ( Fig .
7 , c and e , and Fig .
8 , c and i ) or by monocyte adhesion ( Fig .
2 d ) , indicating that Rho is required for this response .
To investigate whether the mechanism of receptor clustering on HUVECs is linked to stress fiber formation and/or is dependent on the activity of MLCK , as was suggested for the Rho-mediated assembly of integrins into focal contacts ( Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) , we used two MLCK inhibitors ML-7 and BDM .
ML-7 is a potent and selective inhibitor of both Ca**-dependent and -independent MLCKs ( Sai-toh et al. , 1986 ) .
BDM acts as an inhibitor of muscle myo- 1302 sin ATPase activity ( Higuchi and Takemori , 1989 ) .
Both inhibitors caused a loss of stress fibers in HUVECs , as previously reported ( Wojciak-Stothard et al. , 1998 ) ( Fig .
9 , c and e ) , but did not inhibit the antibody-induced clustering of E-selectin ( Fig .
9 d ) , ICAM-1 ( Fig .
9 f ) , or VCAM-1 ( data not shown ) .
These results show that neither Rho-mediated stress fiber formation nor myosin-dependent contractility is necessary for receptor clustering , implying that Rho independently induces the clustering of monocyte-binding receptors and stress fiber formation .
Therefore , we sought to determine whether F-actin or associated proteins were detectably linked with clusters of monocyte-binding receptors .
The localization of E-selectin ( Fig .
10 b ) , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 ( data not shown ) after antibody-induced receptor clustering was not related to stress fibers in HUVECs ( Fig .

Some large clusters of E-selectin ( Fig .

However , F-actin did not detectably colocalize with most clusters of receptors , suggesting that if they are linked with the Wojciak-Stothard et al .

actin cytoskeleton this does not require the presence of large actin-containing structures .
Ezrin/radixin/moesin ( ERM ) proteins can provide a link between some membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton , and in particular ICA M-1 has been reported to interact with ezrin in vitro ( Heiska et al. , 1998 ) .
Antibody-induced clusters of ICAM-1 ( Fig .

This was observed with both small and large clusters of receptors ( Fig .
10 , arrows ) .
This colocalization of ERM proteins with monocyte-binding receptors was not a nonspecific consequence of antibody-induced receptor clustering , as antibody-induced clusters of HLA class I antigen did not colocalize with moesin ( Fig .
10 , g and h ) , ezrin , or radixin ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , clusters of CD5S8/LFA-3 did not colocalize with ERM proteins ( data not shown ) .
Discussion In vivo , leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is a prereq- 1303 uisite for subsequent transmigration across the endothelium into underlying tissues .
In this paper we have demonstrated that Rho in endothelial cells is required for the adhesion and spreading of monocytes , and modulates the clustering of the monocyte-binding receptors , E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 , induced by monocyte adhesion or by cross-linking antibodies .
This clustering is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton , as it is prevented by cytochala- The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 Figure 10 .

sin D , an inhibitor of actin polymerization , which also inhibits monocyte adhesion .
These results demonstrate that responses in endothelial cells activated by receptor engagement are crucial for stable monocyte adhesion , and suggest that Rho may regulate the linkage between monocyte-binding receptors and the actin cytoskeleton to allow the formation of adhesion foci between monocytes and endothelial cells .
1304 The precise links between leukocyte-binding receptors and the actin cytoskeleton have not been identified , but ICAM-1 , ICAM-2 , and E- and L-selectins have all been reported to associate with actin-binding proteins ( Carpen et al. , 1992 ; Yoshida et al. , 1996 ; Brenner et al. , 1997 ; Heiska et al. , 1998 ) .
Clustering of adhesion receptors has been suggested to play a mechanical role in strengthening cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix adhesion .
In fibro-blasts , tension transmitted via extracellular matrix proteins to integrins can strengthen their linkage to the cytoskeleton , and lead to further clustering of integrins ( Choquet et al. , 1997 ) .
Similar responses may occur after leukocyte binding to endothelial cells .
E-Selectin clusters and associates with the actin cytoskeleton during leukocyte adhesion ; this linkage increases the stress resistance of the ligand-receptor binding and can be inhibited by cytochalasin D ( Yoshida et al. , 1996 ) .
We have observed clustering of both E-selectin and ICA M-1 at the margin of adhering monocytes , and in addition found that F-actin colocalized with large clusters of antibody cross-linked receptors , suggesting association of these clusters with the actin cytoskeleton .
Clusters of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 also colocalized with ERM proteins , which are known to interact with F-actin ( Heiska et al. , 1996 , 1998 ; Serrador et al. , 1997 ; Tsukita et al. , 1997 ; Yonemura et al. , 1998 ) .
Association of ERM proteins with the clustered receptors is receptor specific as we did not observe any colocalization of ERM proteins with clusters of HLA class I antigen or with CDS58/LFA-1 , a receptor for CD2 ( Springer , 1990 ) .
The involvement of F-actin in the cross-linking of monocyte-binding receptors and strengthening of monocyte-endothelial adhesion is further supported by the observation that clustering is inhibited by C3 transferase and cytochalasin D. VCAM-1 did not localize at the margins of adherent monocytes , although its clustering by cross-linking antibodies was also dependent on Rho activ-ity .
Therefore , it is likely that monocyte adhesion and spreading on endothelial cells depends initially on Rho-regulated clustering of E-selectin and ICAM-1 , and that VCAM-1 plays a role at later stages of monocyte migration .
Recent evidence suggests that clustering of leukocyte-binding receptors plays a signaling as well as a mechanical role in endothelial cells .
For example , adhesion of monocytes has been reported to induce a transient increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration and also stress fiber assembly in HUVECs , and these responses are mimicked by incubation with antibodies against E-selectin , VCAM-1 , or platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( PECAM-1 ) ( Lorenzon et al. , 1998 ) .
In addition , cross-linking of ICA M-1 on brain endothelial cells was reported to activate Rho and to induce Rho-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase , paxillin , and p130°® '' ( Etienne et al. , 1998 ) .
Our observation that stress fiber formation is stimulated in HUVECs after monocyte adhesion or antibody-induced clustering of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 suggests that these events also activate Rho .
Although we have reported previously that TNF-a itself induces stress fiber formation in quiescent HUVECs ( Wojciak-Stothard et al. , 1998 ) , this is a transient response and by 4 h after TNF- « addition , when monocytes or cross-linking antibodies were added , the Wojciak-Stothard et al .
Rho Regulates Monocyte Binding to Endothelial Cells background level of stress fibers was low .
As the cross-linking of HLA class I antigen and CD58/LFA-3 did not result in increased stress fiber formation , this response appears to be limited to receptors involved in leukocyte interaction .
The mechanisms whereby monocyte-binding receptors transduce signals in endothelial cells have not been estab-lished , but interestingly E-selectin can interact via its cytoplasmic domain with paxillin and focal adhesion kinase ( Yoshida et al. , 1996 ) , which are known to be involved in integrin-mediated signaling and are activated via a Rho-regulated pathway ( Hemler , 1998 ) .
E-Selectin itself is a target for protein phosphorylation : its cytoplasmic domain contains several potential phosphorylation sites , at least one of which becomes phosphorylated in cytokine-acti-vated HUVECs and may therefore act to recruit signaling proteins ( Smeets et al. , 1993 ) .
The cross-linking of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 induces stress fiber formation , but MLCK inhibitors which are known to prevent the formation of stress fibers ( Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ; Wéjciak-Stothard et al. , 1998 ) do not inhibit receptor clustering .
This suggests that occupancy of these receptors leads to Rho activation , which then activates at least two separate signaling pathways , one leading to stress fiber assembly and another to receptor clustering .
As stress fiber formation is not required for receptor clustering , receptor clustering represents a new response mediated by Rho signaling .
Interestingly , introduction of activated V14RhoA into endothelial cells only slightly increased monocyte adhesion , suggesting that endogenous Rho is strongly activated during monocyte binding and that this is sufficient to induce near-maximal monocyte adhesion .
Some of the downstream signaling partners involved in Rho-induced stress fiber formation have been identified ( Sahai et al. , 1998 ; reviewed in van Aelst and D 'Souza-Schory , 1997 ) , and it will be interesting to determine which of these are involved in receptor clustering on endothelial cells .
In some circum-stances , Rho can be activated indirectly via Cdc42 and Rac ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Wéjciak-Stothard et al. , 1998 ) , but as the binding of monocytes to endothelial cells was not inhibited by dominant negative inhibitors of Cdc42 and Rac , clustering of receptors is likely to be an effect of direct activation of Rho by receptor engagement .
The effect of inhibiting Rho on monocyte binding and receptor clustering closely resembled that caused by cytochalasin D , suggesting that Rho regulates the linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to the surface receptors .
Incubation of cells with cytochalasin D leads to gradual loss of actin filaments , as cytochalasin D acts by binding to barbed ends of actin filaments and preventing them from further polymerization or shortening ( Cooper , 1987 ) .
Interestingly , C3 transferase and cytochalasin D have also been reported to inhibit the clustering of Foy receptors on macrophages induced by opsonized particles , and concomitantly inhibit Fey receptor-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation , calcium release , and actin cup formation ( Hackam et al. , 1997 ) .
Together with our results , this suggests that Rho may be more generally involved in mediating the linkage of receptors to the actin cytoskeleton , and that this linkage and resultant receptor clustering is important for cellular signaling .
Precisely how Rho alters receptor clustering is 1305 not known .
It could be required for the formation of links between receptors and the actin cytoskeleton , once receptors have diffused in the plasma membrane , and thereby stabilize transient clusters of receptors .
Alternatively , it could be actively involved in regulating the diffusion of receptors in the plasma membrane .
The mechanism by which Rho regulates links between receptors and the actin cytoskeleton could well involve ERM proteins , which interact with both F-actin and several adhesion receptors , including ICAM-1 ( Heiska et al. , 1996 , 1998 ; Serrador et al. , 1997 ; Tsukita et al. , 1997 ; Yonemura et al. , 1998 ) , and which we have found colocalize with clusters of ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , and E-selectin .
ERM proteins also interact with RhoGD1I , which is normally found in the cytoplasm in complex with Rho proteins , and may thereby facilitate Rho targeting to cell adhesion receptors and subsequent activation ( Takai et al. , 1995 ; Hirao et al. , 1996 ; Takahashi et al. , 1997 ) .
In conclusion , our data indicate that Rho regulates the clustering of the monocyte-binding receptors E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 on the surface of endothelial cells , probably by enhancing their association with the actin cytoskeleton .
The assembly of cytoskeletal connections with the clusters of membrane receptors could then provide `` footholds '' for attached monocytes and create the tension required for their spreading and migration , thereby mimicking the more static nature of extracellular matrix .
A similar requirement for association with the actin cytoskeleton has been reported for integrins in focal adhesion complexes and for L-selectin- and LFA -1-mediated adhesion in leukocytes ( Pavalko et al. , 1995 ; Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ; Lub et al. , 1997 ) .
Clustering of monocyte-binding receptors is not dependent on stress fibers , in contrast to their involvement in focal adhesion assembly ( Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka , 1996 ) .
The formation of stress fibers that accompanies cross-linking of membrane receptors may instead serve to provide a more rigid cell structure to facilitate monocyte migration .
