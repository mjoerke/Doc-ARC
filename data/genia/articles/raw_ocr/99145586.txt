Hilleman , Merck and Co. , Inc , West Point , PA , December 17 , 1998 ( received for review October 28 , 1998 ) ABSTRACT Interleukin 16 ( IL-16 ) is a chemotactic cytokine that binds to the CD4 receptor and affects the activation of T cells and replication of HIV .
It is expressed as a large 67-kDa precursor protein ( pro-IL-16 ) in lymphocytes , mac-rophages , and mast cells , as well as in airway epithelial cells from asthmatics after challenge with allergen .
This pro-IL-16 is subsequently processed to the mature cytokine of 13 kDa .
To study the expression of IL-16 at the transcriptional level , we cloned the human chromosomal IL-16 gene and analyzed its promoter .
The human IL-16 gene consists of seven exons and six introns .
The 5 sequences up to nucleotide -120 of the human and murine IL-16 genes share > 84 % sequence homol-ogy and harbor promoter elements for constitutive and inducible transcription in T cells .
Although both promoters lack any TATA box , they contain two CAAT box-like motifs and three binding sites of GA-binding protein ( GABP ) transcription factors .
Two of these motifs are part of a highly conserved and inducible dyad symmetry element shown previously to control a remote IL-2 enhancer and the CD18 promoter .
In concert with the coactivator CREB binding protein/p300 , which interacts with GABPa , the binding of GABPa and - to the dyad symmetry element controls the induction of IL-16 promoter in T cells .
Supplementing the data on the processing of pro-IL-16 , our results indicate the complexity of IL-16 expression , which is tightly controlled at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels in T lymphocytes .
Interleukin 16 ( IL-16 ) , originally identified in supernatants of mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) ( 1 ) , is synthesized as a large 67-kDa precursor protein ( 2-4 ) .
This pro-IL-16 is almost exclusively expressed in lymphatic tissues ( 4 ) and contains three postsynaptic density protein , disc-large , zonulin-1 ( PDZ ) domains , i.e. , modules involved in protein-protein interactions ( 5 , 6 ) .
The maturation of pro-IL-16 appears to be mediated by caspase 3 leading to the bioactive IL-16 , which consists of the C-terminal 121 amino acids of the precursor ( 4 , 7 ) .
Activated CD8 * and CD4* T cells synthesize identical levels of IL-16 transcripts , but mature IL-16 is predominantly secreted by CD8+* T lymphocytes in response to antigens , histamine , or serotonin ( 8 , 9 ) .
In addi-tion , human mast cells also synthesize pro-IL-16 , and treatment with anaphylatoxin , C5a , or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) increases the IL-16 mRNA level as much as 10-fold ( 10 ) .
IL-16 binds to the CD4 receptor and is therefore selectively active on CD4* T lymphocytes , monocytes , and eosinophils ( 11 , 12 ) .
Like other cytokines , IL-16 exerts numerous and partially contradictory effects in vitro .
Although it is able to render CD4* T cells unresponsive to TCR/CD3 stimuli , it The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

1541 induces the expression of certain activation markers , such as IL-2 receptor subunits ( 13 ) .
The proliferative response of CD4* T cells cotreated with IL-16 and IL-2 for long periods is therefore selectively enhanced ( 14 ) , suggesting the possible use of IL-16 as an immune therapy to counteract conditions of CD4* T cell deficiency such as that associated with AIDS .
Moreover , IL-16 inhibits the replication of T cell and mono-cyte tropic HIV strains in vitro ( 15-17 ) .
HIV patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy display rapidly increasing IL-16 serum levels , possibly reflecting the recovery of the immune system as a consequence of the reduced viral load ( 18 ) .
To learn more about the expression of IL-16 , we have determined the genomic organization of the human IL-16 gene , including the structure and function of its promoter .
A DNA fragment spanning the nucleotides from -408 to +88 of the IL-16 gene was found to exert constitutive promoter activity in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells .
A strong inducible promoter activity in T cells was identified within the immediate 5 ' upstream DNA of approximately 90 bp .
Although this promoter fragment lacks any TATA box-like sequence element , it contains three binding sites for Ets-like proteins .
One of these fragments overlaps with the previously reported transcriptional start sites ( 4 ) , whereas the other two sites generate a dyad symmetry element ( DSE ) .
We show here that these sites are bound by GA-binding protein ( GABP ) factors which , in concert with the coactivators CREB binding protein ( CBP ) /p300 , appear to play an important role in the control of the IL-16 promoter .
CBP/p300 binds to GABPa and enhances strongly the GABP mediated IL-16 promoter induction .

Recombinant DNA Work and Sequence Analysis .
Overlapping human IL-16 gene fragments were amplified by using human PBMC DNA , the Tth-Polymerase Mix ( CLONTECH ) , and the following primer pairs : ( 5'-CTGCTGCTACCACAG-GAAGACACAGCAG-3 ' and 5-GAGCTGATTCTCTGC-CTGATGGA-3 ' ; 5-GAGCACCTAGGATCACACATC-3 ' and 5'-CAGAGCTGAGAGAATATACAGAGGGTC-3 ' and 5'-TTCTAGATCTGCTCCTCCTGCCAAGCT-3 ' ; CACCATCTTACACAAGGAG-3 ' and TGCAGAGGCTGAGGCTGCAG-3 ' ; 5 '' -CACAGAGTGTT-TCCAAATGGGCTGGCC-3 ' and 5'-AGCTGTGTGT-GTTATTGGCTTTGGCTTC-3 ' ; 5-ACCACAGCTGCTG-GAGACTCCTAG-3 ' and 5-GTGGTAAGTAGTAGCAAT-TTTATTTGATAC-3 ' ) The amplification products were cloned in the pGEM-T-vector ( Promega ) and sequenced .
To minimize sequencing errors , multiple clones were sequenced for every fragment .
For the cloning of the chromosomal DNA upstream of the human IL-16 cDNA-sequence two cDNA based reverse-complementary primers , hGSP1 : 5-TCTTCTCCACCCTG-GCTCGCCCTCTGT-3 ' and hGSP2 : S ! -ACTTGGTCTGT-GGGCCGATACCAGGT-3 ' , were used in a nested PCR with parts of the human PromoterFinder DNA Walking kit ( CLONTECH ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Fragments of 1.7 kb ( Drel library ) and 1.9 kb ( Pvull library ) were amplified and cloned in pGEM-T. Sequencing revealed the expected 62 bp of the 5 ' end of the IL-16 cDNA sequence ( 4 ) upstream of the GSP2 binding site , proving the specificity of the PCRs .
In the same way , by using the murine IL-16 cDNA-specific reverse-complementary primers mGSP1 : 5'-GGCACTCCTCCTTGACTCTCCTTCTGA-3 ' and mGSP2 : 5'-TGAAGTCTGCGTGCTGGCTGCAGGTC-3 ' along with the murine PromoterFinder DNA Walking kit ( CLONTECH ) , a 1.2-kb genomic fragment ( Sspl-library ) containing the sequence upstream of the known cDNA ( 19 ) and 52 bp of its 5'-end was amplified .
For the construction of the promoter/reporter gene plas-mids the genomic fragment from -1048 to +88 was amplified by using primers P1 : GAAGCCTGCAGCCATGTC-3 ' , and P2 : TATCTCGAGCTTGGTCTGTGGGGCGATACCAGGT-3 ' and human DNA from PBMCs as template .
The PCR product was cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector ( Promega ) and sequenced .
Using this plasmid as template , the subfragments -408/+88 , -133/+88 , -90/+88 , -408/+3 , -408/-110 were amplified and cloned in pGL-3-Basic .
All clonings were verified by sequencing .
GG-to-CC changes within the ERE ( Ets-related element ) -C and -D motifs and the +12 GABP-binding site were introduced into the -408/+88 promoter fragment by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system ( Stratagene ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift Assays ( EMSAs ) .
EMSAs were performed as described ( 20 ) by using 2 pg of nuclear protein and 0.5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) .
In supershift EMSAs , 1 ug of antibodies ( Abs ) raised against GABP « , B ( 21 ) or PU.1 ( 20 ) were added to the incubations .
When the DNA binding of recombinant GABP was tested , 2.5-20 ng of bacterially expressed proteins prepared as described ( 21 ) were incubated in EMSAs .
Interaction Between GABPs and p300 .
Five micrograms of bacterially expressed GST /p300 fusion proteins was immobilized on glutathione agarose beads ( 30 ul ) and incubated with 50 ng of bacterially expressed full-size GABPa , -B or - « +B ( 21 ) in 500 pl of binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris-Cl , pH 7.8/75 mM NaCl1/0.5 mM EDTA/O0.5 mM EGTA/S5 mM NaF/0.5 mM DTT/20 mM leupeptin/0.2 mM AMSF/0.5 % nonfat dry milk Proc .

After rotating for 2 h at 4°C and extensive washings with the binding buffer , bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer , fractionated on a 12.5 % polyacrylamide gel , and immunodetected by using GABPa+ -specific Abs .
RESULTS Organization of the Human IL-16 Gene .
For the analysis of the chromosomal IL-16 gene , overlapping genomic DNA fragments from human PBMCs were amplified by using IL-16 cDNA-specific primer pairs and sequenced .
The human IL-16 gene spans approximately 12.8 kb and consists of seven exons and six introns ( Fig .
1 ) .
Exon I contains the largest part of the -untranslated mRNA region .
The first ATG , which corresponds to the translational start codon ( 4 ) , starts on nucleotide position 51 of exon II .
This exon is unusually long ( 1096 bp ) , encoding 348 aa harboring the proline-rich part and the N-terminal region of the first PDZ domain ( 19 ) .
Exon III and the first nucleotides of exon IV code for the remainder of the first PDZ domain .
PDZ-2 is encoded by the exons IV and V. Exons VI and VII contain the sequence for PDZ-3 ( found in mature IL-16 ) .
The cleavage site for the putative processing enzyme caspase 3 is encoded in exon V. Characterization of the IL-16 Promoter .
Fig .
2 shows a sequence comparison between the 5'-flanking regions of human and murine IL-16 genes spanning the nucleotides from position -440 to +130 .
The 5'-untranslated mRNA regions and the immediate upstream regions ( up to -120 ) from both genes share a high sequence homology , suggesting their functional importance .
Multiple transcriptional initiation sites have been identified within 40 bp 5 ' of the murine and human IL-16 genes ( 4 , 19 ) from which the most upstream site of human IL-16 gene was assigned to be position +1 ( 4 ) .
Accordingly , neither the human nor murine IL-16 gene contains a canonical TATA box .
CAAT box motifs are present at the positions -98 and -118 , and at +12 , -25 , and -39 of both genes three sites are located for the putative binding of Ets-like transcription factors .
The Ets elements at +12 and -25 of the human gene form a direct repeat of 11 bp , whereas in both genes those repeats around -25 and -39 are part of a 33 bp-inverted repeat .
A very similar repeat designated as DSE was recently identified as an inducible sequence element of a distal IL-2 enhancer ( 20 ) .
To test the IL-16 promoter activity , a DNA fragment from position -1048 to +88 and shorter subfragments were cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene and transiently trans- suf proline-rich UT | 200 bp I I AAUAAA AAUAAA Fig .

The complete gene of approximately 12.8 kb was cloned and sequenced as six overlapping fragments depicted above the gene structure .
The use of an alternative splice acceptor in intron 5 , three nucleotides downstream of the regular site , generates a transcript with a missing alanine codon ( not shown ) .
This splice acceptor is predominantly used in mice because we were unable to find cDNAs encoding this alanine in murine PBMCs ( 19 ) .

Comparison of 5 ' sequences of human and murine IL-16 genes .
The published start points of transcription in human cells are shown in bold ( 4 ) .
Nucleotide +1 corresponds to the first transcription start site of the human gene .
Identical nucleotides in both sequences are indicated by * .
Deletions indicated by dashes were introduced to obtain the highest degree of homology .
The CAAT box-like sequences around positions -98 and -118 and direct repeats around +12 and -25 are overlined , the dyad symmetry element , DSE , is double-underlined , and the GABP -binding sites are boxed .
fected into Jurkat T , cells which express considerable amounts of pro-IL-16 , and HeLa cells , which express IL-16 at very low levels ( unpublished results ) .
As shown in Fig .
34 , the fragments -1048/+88 and -408/+88 exhibited a distinct promoter activity in both types of cells , being 4- to 5-fold stronger in Jurkat cells than in HeLa cells .
Deletion of 5 ' nucleotides up to the CAAT box-like motifs ( up to -133 ) resulted in a 50 % decrease and the removal of this motifs by deletion up to -90 in a further strong decrease of constitutive promoter activity .
A similar strong decrease was observed after deleting the 3 ' region between positions +3 and +88 containing the Ets element at +12 , and the removal of sequences between -110 and +88 abolished any promoter activity .
To delineate the inducible promoter elements , transfected Jurkat cells and HeLa cells were induced with phorbol ester for 20 h. This resulted in a 7- to 8-fold increase of luciferase reporter gene expression in Jurkat cells , but not in HeLa cells transfected with constructs containing the IL-16 promoter region from -90 to +88 ( Fig .
3B ) .
Deletion of the sequences from +4 to +88 , which include the third Ets-like protein binding site at +12 decreased the inducibility up to 50 % .
Because removal of the upstream region from position -1048 to -90 did not change the inducibility , the fragment from A position -90 to +88 appears to harbor all sequence motifs for the induction of the IL-16 promoter in T cells .
The Binding of GABPa and - to the Ets-Binding Sites of Proximal Promoter Region Contributes to the IL-16 Promoter Induction .
The DSE of the distal IL-2 enhancer ( DSEq .
; ) is bound by GABP factors ( 20 ) , suggesting a binding of these factors to the IL-16 DSE ( DSEmis ) as well .
To test this assumption , nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells were incubated in EMSAs by using the DSEs from the IL-16 promoter and distal IL-2 enhancer as probes .
Very similar to the DSE. , four specific protein-DNA complexes were generated with the DSEn..14 which we designate as I ( a and b , higher and lower , respectively ) , II , and III ( Fig .
44 ) .
TPA treatment of cells did not alter their appearance ( data not shown ) .
The formation of all four complexes was abolished by a 100- and 200-fold molar excess of the unlabeled probe or a similar excess of the ERE-A site from the DSEy. , .
; ( Fig .
4B ) and the SV40 enhancer Ets site , a known GABP -binding site ( 20 ) and the +12 Ets-like site ( see Fig .
44 , lanes 3+4 , 7+8 , 9+10 , and 15+16 ) .
The competition with the +12 site indicates that this site is an additional GABP -binding site .
No competition was observed when the same excess was used of a DSEy.,14 mutated in both Ets motifs ( Fig .
44 , lanes 5+6 ) or of binding sites for NF-AT , AP-1 and NF-KB factors ( Fig .
44 , lanes 11-14 , 17+18 ) .

Two micrograms of nuclear protein from noninduced Jurkat cells was incubated either with the DSEn .
; ( lane 1 ) or DSEn.16 ( lanes 2-18 ) as probes ( see B ) followed by electrophoresis on a native 4 % polyacrylamide gel .
For competi-tion , 25 and 50 ng of the following oligonucleotides were added : lanes 3 and 4 , DSE , 16 ; lanes 5 and 6 , DSEn.14 mutated in both Ets motifs ; lanes 7 and 8 , IL-16 Ets motif at position +12 ; lanes 9 and 10 , IL-2 ERE-A motif ( see B ) ; lanes 11 and 12 , distal NF-AT site from the murine IL-2 promoter ( see ref .

SS , complexes supershifted by GABP Abs .
( DD ) Binding of recombinant GABPa and -B to the DSEn.16 .
Bacterially expressed GABPa or -B ( 2.5-20 ng ) was incubated with a DSEp..14 probe as indicated .
I-III indicate DNA-protein complexes identical in mobility to those generated with nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells ( 4 ) .
To identify the GABP proteins in the IL-16 DSE complexes , EMSA supershift assays were performed by using Abs raised against GABPa and -B .
As shown in Fig .
4C ( lanes 1-4 ) , addition of these Abs resulted in the generation of several `` supershift complexes '' at the expense of complexes I and II .
No changes in complex formation were observed when an Ab raised against Pu.1 , another factor of Ets family ( Fig .
4C , lane 5 ) was used .
To confirm these results showing GABP proteins in the DSE complexes , increasing concentrations of bacterially expressed recombinant GABPa and -B proteins were incubated in EMSAs with a DSEn.14 probe .
This resulted in the generation of three retarded DNA-protein complexes ( Fig .

Whereas the rapidly running complex III was generated with GABPa alone , for the generation of complexes Ia and II , the presence of both GABPa and -B was necessary indicating the presence of both GABP proteins in complexes I and II .
To demonstrate a functional role for GABPa and - $ in the induction of IL-16 promoter , we transfected a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the IL-16 promoter ( from -408 to +88 ) into Jurkat and 293 cells alone or with vectors expressing GABPa and -B .

Jurkat cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the IL-16 promoter ( from -408 to +88 ) , SRSPA-based vectors expressing GABPa or -B , or both , as indicated .
The cells were left untreated or stimulated with TPA ( 10 ng/ml ) for 24 h. ( B ) The GABP -binding sites within the IL-16 promoter are of crucial importance for its activity .
Human 293 cells were transfected with a wild-type IL-16 promoter /luciferase gene construct or mutated IL-16 promoter/ luciferase constructs alone or together with vectors expressing GABPa and -B. CmDm , mutations in the ERE-C and ERE-D motifs ( see Fig .

293 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the IL-16 promoter ( from -408 to +88 ) and 0-50 ng of a p300 expression vector as indicated .
( D ) Interaction between GABPa and p300 .
Equal amounts of bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase/p300 fusion proteins spanning N-terminal , middle , or C-terminal portions of p300 immobilized on glutathione agrose beads were incubated with 500 ng of bacterially expressed GABPa , -6 or - « +f .
The bound proteins were eluted and immunodetected by using a mix of GABPa+ B-specific Abs .
As a control for p300/GABP interaction , a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the N-terminal transacting domain of NF-ATe ( TADNF-ATe , 113-205 ) was used .
In lane 13 , 50 ug of nuclear proteins from 293 cells were fractionated .
The appearance of a weak GABPa band in lane 11 is the result of an accidental contamination of the GABPB protein preparation with GABPa .
The appearance of a second GABPa band in many lanes is probably a GABPa cleavage product .
The lowest strong band is most likely the result of the crossreactivity of GABP Abs with a bacterial protein binding unspecifically to p300 .

Mutations in the GABP sites ERE-C and -D ( Fig .
4B ) , which abolished any GABP binding ( Fig .
44 , lanes 5+6 ) reduced significantly the stimulatory effect of GABP proteins on the constitutive and inducible activity of IL-16 promoter ( Fig .
5B , CmDm ) .
Mutation of the +12 GABP site , alone or together with the CmDm mutations , suppressed any promoter induction ( Fig .
5B , INIm and CmDm+INIm ) , indicating a critical role for this site in the control of promoter activity .
The Cofactors CBP/p300 Bind to GABP Proteins and Enhance the Induction of IL-16 Promoter .
Ets-1 , the prototype of Ets factors , was shown to cooperate with the nuclear coactivators CBP /p300 ( 23 , 24 ) .
To investigate whether CBP / p300 plays a similar role in the activation of IL-16 promoter by GABP factors , increasing amounts of vectors expressing p300 or CBP were cotransfected into 293 cells with the luciferase reporter gene controlled by the IL-16 promoter .
Overexpress-ing p300 ( Fig .
5C ) or CBP ( data not shown ) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the constitutive and inducible IL-16 promoter activity , suggesting that this cofactor participates in the activation of the IL-16 promoter .
To demonstrate that the GABP factors are the targets of p300-mediated activation of the IL-16 promoter , binding of p300 to GABP proteins was tested .
Bacterially expressed , full-length GABPa and - were incubated with GST /p300 proteins spanning large portions of the N-terminal , central , and C-terminal regions of p300 .
As shown in Fig .
5D , GABPa bound specifically to the C-terminal part of p300 and much more weakly to its N-terminal part .
No binding to the N-terminal transactivation domain of NF-ATe ( TAD-NFATc ) used as negative control was observed .
GABP $ was only found in the GST /p300-bound fraction when incubated together with GABPa ( Fig .
5D , lane 12 ) , indicating an indirect , GABPa-mediated recruitment of GABPB .
These results demonstrate a direct interaction between GABPa and the C-terminal part of p300 .
DISCUSSION In this study we have described the structure of the human IL-16 gene , including its promoter .
The IL-16 gene consists of seven exons .
Exons II-VII encode the pro-IL-16 precursor protein , whereas the mature IL-16 is encoded by sequences of the last three exons .
The IL-16 gene is almost exclusively expressed in lymphocytes and epidermis cells of the respiratory tract after allergic stimulation ( 4 , 25 , 26 ) .
It has been shown that the activation of lymphocytes by antigens , PHA , and other mitogens strongly increases the transcription of IL-16 ( 1 , 10 ) .
We have identified the immediate upstream region of the IL-16 gene ( reaching up to nucleotide position -90 ) , along with the first 88 bp of the untranslated mRNA region , as the most important DNA fragment for the control of inducible expression of IL-16 gene in T lymphocytes .
This region contains three GGAA core motifs for the binding of Ets-like factors around the positions -39 , -25 , and +12 .
The two upstream sites at -39 and -25 form a 33-bp DSE that resembles the DSE motifs within a distal IL-2 enhancer ( see Fig .
4B ) and the CD18 promoter .
As shown previously for GABP binding to the DSE of the distal IL-2 enhancer ( 20 ) the GABP proteins a and B are the most prominent factors binding to the DSE of IL-16 promoter in nuclear protein extracts from T cells .
Because the introduction of mutations into these GABP binding sites ( Fig .
4B ) reduced significantly the induction of promoter in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
54 ) , one has to conclude that the binding of GABP factors to both sites is of crucial importance for the induction of IL-16 promoter in T cells .
GABPa and -B form heterodimeric ( -B ) and heterotet-rameric ( a , -f3 ; ) complexes when they bind to the DSE of the distal IL-2 enhancer ( 20 , 21 ) .
The same heteromeric complexes were generated with the DSE.14 as probe ( Fig .
4 4 and D ) .
However , approximately 3-fold more tetrameric than dimeric Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 96 ( 1999 ) 1545 complexes were formed on the DSEn.14 than DSEp. , ; ( deter-mined by dividing the amount of tetrameric complexes by that of dimeric complexes according to phosphoimager data , see also lanes 1 and 2 in Fig .
44 ) .
This may be caused by the specific structure of in which the GGAA core sequences , although forming a palindrome ( as in the DSEp. , ; ) are not directed to each other ( as in the DSEn. , ; ) but are directed in opposite directions .
This configuration appears to facilitate the formation of heterotetramers , probably through the leucine zipper motifs in GABP ( see refs .
27 and 28 for a discussion ) and appears to enhance transcription .
We have shown previously for the activity of multiples of DSEn. , ; that the generation of heterotetramers gives rise to a strong activation of transcription compared with the relatively weak activity of multiple repeats of identical EREs to which GABPa and -B bind as heterodimers ( 20 ) .
The transcriptional induction of IL-16 promoter by GABP factors is distinctly enhanced by the cofactors CBP/p300 , which interact with GABPa ( Fig .
5D ) .
CBP and p300 are nuclear proteins that were shown to bind to and to increase the activity of numerous transcription factors by exerting adaptor functions and histone acetylase activity ( 29 ) .
Moreover , they provide a molecular platform for a large number of potentially important associated proteins ( 30 ) .
Interestingly , several inducible transcription factors , such as AP-1/c-Jun , NF-kB/p65 , and the NF-AT factors NF-ATp and c , that are activated after lymphocyte activation , were shown to cooperate with CBP/ p300 ( 31 , 32 ) .
For NF-ATe , it has been demonstrated that CBP/p300 is able to synergize with multiple protein kinase cascades in the transcriptional activation of this factor .
This may also be true for the activation of GA BPs that are a nuclear target of Ras-Raf-Erk and JNK/SAP kinase cascades ( 21 , 33 ) .
Although a direct phosphorylation of GABPa by Erk2 has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo ( 33 ) , the phosphorylation of CBP /p300 or of associated proteins by these mitogen-activated protein kinases provides a further level of regulation through which the induction of IL-16 promoter by GABP factors may be controlled in T cells .
The third Ets-like binding site at position +12 appears to be a further GABP-binding site .
Deletion of the region containing this site decreased both the constitutive and inducible activation of IL-16 promoter ( see Fig .
34 ) .
Many TATA-less RNA polymerase II promoters contain typical initiator elements , i.e. , short conserved sequences that are bound by proteins of the transcriptional machinery .
Some of these promoters , including the CD3s , CD4 , CD11ec , CD18 , CD72 , IL-2R $ , TGF RII , Ets-2 , murine laminin B2 , type IV colla-genase , thymidylate synthetase , and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV promoters possess Ets-like binding motifs near their transcriptional start sites , suggesting a new class of initiator elements ( 34-45 ) .
Recently , two PEA3 motifs that are bound by GABP factors were shown to function as a minimal transcriptional initiator element when placed in front of a luciferase gene ( 46 ) .
Thus , the +12 GABP binding site of IL-16 promoter might act as a similar initiator element starting transcription from the TATA-less IL-16 gene .
The CAAT box-like sequences located between -133 and -90 are needed for the full IL-16 promoter activity in both Jurkat T cells and HeLa cells .
Additional positively acting sequence element ( s ) is/are located in the region between -408 and -133 , because deletion of this segment leads to a 50 % decrease of promoter activity .
However , the sequence elements and the transcription factors binding to and controlling the activity of these elements remain to be identified .
Taken together , the structure of the inducible IL-16 promoter differs markedly from that of typical interleukin promoters ( such as the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters ) , which are predominantly activated on antigen-mediated stimulation in peripheral CD4 * T cells .
It will be interesting to determine the 1546 Immunology : Bannert et al .
