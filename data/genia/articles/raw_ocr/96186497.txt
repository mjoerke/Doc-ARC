3 Effects of Interleukin-10 on Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Responses to Cryptococcus neoformans , Candida albicans , and Lipopolysaccharide STUART M. LEVITZ , * ABDULMONEIM TABUNI , SHU-HUA NONG , anp DOUGLAS T. GOLENBOCK Evans Memorial Department of Clinical Research and Department of Medicine , Boston University Medical Center Hospital and Boston City Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts 02118 Received 5 October 1995/Returned for modification 28 November 1995/Accepted 20 December 1995 Deactivation of mononuclear phagocytes is critical to limit the inflammatory response but can be detrimental in the face of progressive infection .
We compared the effects of the deactivating cytokine interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) responses to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , Cryptococcus neoformans , and Candida albicans .
IL-10 effected dose-dependent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a @ ) release in PBMC stimulated by LPS and C. neoformans , with significant inhibition seen with 0.1 U/ml and greater than 90 % inhibition noted with 10 U/ml .
In contrast , even at doses as high as 100 U/ml , IL-10 inhibited TNF-a « release in response to C. albicans by only 50 % .
IL-10 profoundly inhibited release of IL-1B from PBMC stimulated by all three stimuli .
TNF- « @ mRNA and release was inhibited even if IL-10 was added up to 8 h after cryptococcal stimulation .
In contrast , inhibition of IL-1B mRNA was of lesser magnitude and occurred only when IL-10 was added within 2 h of cryptococcal stimulation .
IL-10 inhibited translocation of NF-B in response to LPS but not the fungal stimuli .
All three stimuli induced IL-10 production in PBMC , although over 10-fold less IL-10 was released in response to C. reoformans compared with LPS and C. albicans .
Thus , while IL-10 has deactivating effects on PBMC responses to all three stimuli , disparate stimulus- and response-specific patterns of deactivation are seen .
Inhibition by IL-10 of proinflammatory cytokine release appears to occur at the level of gene transcription for TNF-a « @ and both transcriptionally and posttranscrip- tionally for IL-1§B .
The opportunistic fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans have a marked propensity to cause infections in persons with impaired cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) , especially those with AIDS .
In particular , cryptococcosis has emerged as the most frequent life-threatening mycotic infections in persons with AIDS , afflicting at least 5 to 10 % of AIDS patients in the United States and an even higher percentage in Africa and other parts of the developing world ( 5 , 7 , 24 ) .
Mucocutaneous candidiasis affects the majority of persons with AIDS at some point during the course of their illness and , while rarely life threatening , can cause considerable morbidity ( 39 ) .
Despite advances in therapy , cryptococcosis and candidiasis can be difficult infections to successfully treat , especially in the severely immunosuppressed .
While clinical and experimental data convincingly demonstrate that CMI is crucial in host defenses against these mycoses , the specific mechanisms by which an intact CMI response results in protection are only incompletely defined .
A central mechanism by which the CMI response is thought to protect the host against mycoses is through the production of proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , tumor necrosis factor alpha [ TNF- « ] and interleukin-1f [ IL-1B ] ) which recruit and activate leukocytes to inhibit and kill invading fungi .
TNF- « and IL-18B promote inflammation , through the induction of cell adhesion molecules , neutrophil and macrophage chemotactic factors , acute-phase proteins , and the generation of other proinflammatory cytokines ( 12 , 45 ) .
Recent reports from our laboratory and elsewhere have documented that C. neoformans and C. * Corresponding author .

945 albicans are potent stimulators of TNF-a release from mononuclear phagocytes ( 30 , 31 , 35 ) .
Administration of neutralizing antibody against TNF- « was deleterious in murine models of cryptococcosis and candidiasis ( 6 , 31 , 43 ) .
When produced in appropriate quantities , proinflammatory cytokines play a beneficial role as mediators of host resistance to infectious agents .
However , overproduction can lead to local and systemic toxicity .
Moreover , TNF- « and IL-1 induce human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication in latently infected cells , and it has been postulated that release of these cytokines in vivo could accelerate HIV progression ( 19 , 37 ) .
Thus , strategies designed to decrease the release of proinflammatory cytokines offer the promise of improving outcome by reducing the morbidity associated with the inflammatory response and , in persons with AIDS , diminishing viral replica-tion .
One such strategy being studied is the use of IL-10 ( 23 ) .
IL-10 is produced by CD4* T helper type 2 ( Th2 ) cells , CD8* T cells , monocytes , macrophages , and B cells .
IL-10 deactivates macrophages directly by influencing macrophage recruitment , viability , morphology , phagocytosis , expression of cytokine receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules , antigen presentation , production of monokines , generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates , and killing of microbes and tumor cells ( 2 , 20 ) .
IL-10 can also act indirectly by suppressing T-cell proliferation and/or gamma interferon production .
In this study , we examined the effect of IL-10 on selected human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) responses to C. neoformans and C. albicans .

Fungi .
C. neoformans serotype A strain 145 ( 27 , 30 , 36 ) was grown in RPMI 1640 ( without bicarbonate ) ( pH 6.0 ) at 37°C .
Under such conditions , capsule thickness averaged 1.2 wm , as measured with a light microscope equipped with a calibrated ocular micrometer following negative staining with India ink ( 30 ) .
A well-described isolate of C. albicans ( 28 , 44 ) was grown in the yeast phase on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25°C .
Fungi were harvested after 4 days of growth , washed at least five times in PBS , heat killed at 50°C for 30 min , and stored at 4°C .
Overgrowth of cultures during the 18-h incubations precluded use of live fungi .
Isolation of leukocyte populations .
Leukocyte populations were purified as in previous studies by standard techniques ( 26 , 30 ) .
Peripheral human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers by venipuncture .
For each set of experiments , no donor was used more than once .
Blood was anticoagulated with 10 U of pyrogen-free heparin ( Elkins-Sinn , Inc. , Cherry Hill , N.J. ) per ml and centrifuged at 500 x g for 15 min , and the leukocyte-rich buffy coat was harvested .
PBMC were collected following centrifugation of the buffy coat over a gradient of Ficoll-Hypaque .
In some experiments , PBMC were depleted of T cells and some natural killer cells on the basis of their capacity to rosette neuraminidase-treated sheep erythrocytes .
T cells and some natural killer cells express CD2 and rosette sheep erythrocytes , whereas other cell types , including monocytes , do not ( 26 ) .
Cytokine release .
Leukocytes were mixed with fungi in 96-well polystyrene plates ( Costar Corporation , Cambridge , Mass . ) .
Unstimulated leukocytes and LPS served as negative and positive controls , respectively .
At defined intervals , supernatants were removed and stored at -70°C until analysis for cytokine release .
TNF-a and IL-1B were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , using the antibodies listed above , as described in full elsewhere ( 30 , 32 ) .
The ELISAs were sensitive over a range of 100 to 3,000 pg of INFECT .

TNF-a and IL-16 per ml of supernatant .
IL-10 was measured by ELISA sensitive to 10 pg of IL-10 per ml , using antibody pairs ( PharMingen , San Diego , Calif. ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Isolation and quantitation of mRNA .
Total cellular RNA was extracted from 5 x 10° to 10 x 10° cells per sample by using an RNA isolation kit ( Tri-reagent ; Medical Research Center , Cincinnati , Ohio ) and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously ( 30 ) .
Hybridized probe was visualized by autoradiogra-phy and quantitated by densitometry ( Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitom-eter equipped with ImageQuant software ; Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
mRNA stability .
PBMC ( 5 X 10° ) were stimulated with 100 ng of LPS per ml or C. neoformans ( 5 X 10 '' ) in six-well plates .
At 3 h poststimulation , half the wells received 10 U of IL-10 per ml .
At 4 h poststimulation , 5 ug of actinomycin D per ml was added to shut down new gene expression .
Total RNA was harvested 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 3 h after addition of actinomycin D , and 10 ug of each sample was subjected to Northern blot analysis for TNF- « message .
Autoradio-graphic signals were quantified by densitometry as described above .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF- « B was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay exactly as described previously ( 8 , 18 ) .
Briefly , nuclear extracts from stimulated PBMC were prepared in the presence of the protease inhibitors , and protein concentration was determined by using a commercial kit ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Her-cules , Calif. ) .
A synthetic oligonucleotide containing the NF- « B binding sequence was end labeled with [ a- '' °P ] dATP and [ « -°P ] dCTP , using the Klenow fragment .
Unincorporated nucleotides were removed with a G-25 spin column ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , N.J. ) .
Labeled probe ( 0.2 ng ) and nuclear extract ( 4 mg ) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 1 % band shift buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.8 ] , 1 mM EDTA , 40 mM KCI , 1 mM dithioth-reitol ) containing 50 g of poly ( dI-dC ) per ml and 5 % glycerol .
Reactions were then size fractionated by electrophoresis in 4 % native polyacrylamide gels , transferred to 3MM filter paper ( Whatman Laboratory Products , Clifton , N.J. ) , dried , and visualized by autoradiography .
Samples were quantitated by densitometry as described above .
A 25-molar excess of unlabeled probe was used as a specific competitor .
Statistics and presentation of data .
Mcans and standard errors were compared by the two-tailed , two-sample £ test on a statistical software program ( SigmaStat for Windows ; Jandel Scientific Software , San Rafael , Calif. ) .
For experiments in which multiple comparisons were made , adjustments for significance were made with the Bonferroni correction .
RESULTS Effect of IL-10 on TNF-a release .
In preliminary experiments , it was determined that maximal TNF- « release occurred at a 10:1 ratio of C. neoformans to PBMC ( 30 ) and a 2:1 ratio of C. albicans to PBMC ( data not shown ) .
Next , the effect of IL-10 on TNF-a release from PBMC stimulated by LPS , C. neoformans , and C. albicans was studied .
IL-10 effected dose-dependent inhibition of TNF- « release in PBMC stimulated by LPS and C. neoformans , with significant inhibition seen with 0.1 U of IL-10 per ml and greater than 90 % inhibition noted with 10 U of IL-10 per ml ( Fig .
1 ) .
In contrast , even at doses as high as 100 U/ml , IL-10 inhibited TNF-a release in response to C. albicans by only 50 % .
Consistent with previously published experiments ( 30 ) , fractionation of PBMC based on their capacity to rosette sheep erythrocytes revealed that TNF- « release was associated almost exclusively with the monocyte-enriched fraction .
Moreover , inhibition of TNF- « release by IL-10 was similar to that for monocyte-enriched PBMC ( data not shown ) .
As previously demonstrated for C. neoformans ( 30 ) , TNF-a release in response to C. albicans was not secondary to endotoxin contamination , as demonstrated by the inability of 1 ug of the LPS antagonist RSLA per ml to inhibit TNF- « release from PBMC ( 18.3 + 1.5 and 17.9 + 1.8 ng of TNF-a per ml [ mean + standard error of three triplicate experiments ] with and without RSLA , respectively ) .
In contrast , in concurrent experiments , RSLA inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF- « release from PBMC by 91 % .
Effect of IL-10 on fungal binding .
One possible explanation for the inhibitory effects of IL-10 on TNF release was an effect on binding of the fungi to PBMC .
To test this possibility , PBMC were incubated with C. neoformans and C. albicans in the presence or absence of 10 U of IL-10 per ml , and binding VoL .

Effect of IL-10 on IL-1§ release from stimulated PBMC .
PBMC ( 2.5 X 10° ) were stimulated with 100 ng of LPS per ml , or with C. neoformans ( CN ) or C. albicans ( CA ) at the indicated fungus-to-PBMC ratio in the absence ( - ) or presence ( + ) of 10 U of IL-10 per ml .
After 18 h , supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-1B by ELISA .

was assessed .
For both fungi , IL-10 had no significant effect on binding .
( Binding indices at a C. neoformans-to-PBMC ratio of 2:1 were 59.0 + 3.2 and 60.7 + 3.9 with and without IL-10 , respectively .
Binding indices at a C. albicans-to-PBMC ratio of 1:2 were 58.9 + 8.0 and 66.2 + 12.8 with and without IL-10 , respectively . )
Similar results were found at other effector/tar-get cell ratios ( data not shown ) .
Release of IL-1B .
We next examined the effect of IL-10 on IL-18 release from PBMC stimulated with C. neoformans and C. albicans ( Fig .
2 ) .
Both fungi stimulated IL-1B release , although C. albicans was the more potent inducer .
Levels of IL-1B8 were greater than those seen with the LPS positive control even at a 1:2 ratio of C. albicans to PBMC .
In contrast , IL-18 release in response to a 10:1 ratio of C. neoformans to PBMC was similar to that seen with LPS stimulation but decreased by 84 % when the ratio was decreased to 2:1 .
Addition of 10 U of IL-10 per ml profoundly inhibited release of IL-1B from PBMC stimulated by LPS and both fungi .
Time course of effects of IL-10 on TNF-a release .
The next set of experiments sought to examine whether IL-10 could still inhibit TNF- « release even if added after the PBMC had already been stimulated .
PBMC were stimulated for 18 h with LPS , C. neoformans , or C. albicans .
IL-10 was added to the cell wells at 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , or 8 h into the 18-h incubation , following which TNF- « was measured in the supernatants ( Fig .
3A ) .
In parallel wells , supernatants were removed at 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , or 8 h and assayed for TNF- « in order to determine the amount of TNF-a « released prior to the addition of the IL-10 ( Fig .
3B ) .
Consistent with previous results ( 30 ) , TNF- « release in response to C. neoformans had delayed kinetics compared with that seen with LPS .
The kinetics in response to C. albicans was similar to that seen with LPS .
TNF- « release in response to C. neoformans was inhibited by more than 95 % even if IL-10 was added up to 2 h after fungal stimulation .
Moreover , 50 % inhibition was seen when IL-10 was added 8 h into the incuba-tion .
Considering that at 8 h TNF- « release in response to C. neoformans was 34 % of that seen at 18 h , it is apparent that the vast majority of new TNF-a release is inhibited by IL-10 regardless of the time of addition of IL-10 .
As in Fig .
1 , IL-10 also inhibited TNF- « release in response to C. albicans , although to a lesser extent than in response to C. neoformans and LPS .
In agreement with data from Wang et al .
( 46 ) , potent EFFECTS OF IL-10 ON PBMC RESPONSES TO THREE STIMULI 947 inhibition was seen even if IL-10 was added up to 2 h after LPS stimulation .
Effect of IL-10 on TNF- « and IL-1f gene expression and stability .
Having established that IL-10 inhibits TNF- « and IL-18 release , we next examined whether inhibition occurs at the level of gene expression ( Fig .
4 ) .
PBMC were stimulated with C. neoformans for 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 h. During the stimulation , IL-10 was omitted or added at 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , or 8 h. RNA was extracted , and Northern analysis was performed .
Consistent with previous data ( 30 ) , in the absence of IL-10 , C. neoformans stimulated peak TNF-a message at 4 to 8 h. In contrast , IL-1B message appeared slightly earlier , with significant message seen by 2 h and peak message seen at 4 h. Addition of IL-10 at the start of the incubation inhibited peak TNF- « and IL-1B message by 83 and 57 % , respectively , as measured by scanning densitometry .

Effect of time of addition of IL-10 on inhibition of TNF-a release from stimulated PBMC .
PBMC ( 2.5 x 10° ) were stimulated with 100 ng of LPS per ml , C. neoformans ( Crypto ; 5 X 10° ) , or C. albicans ( Candida ; 5 X 10° ) .
( A ) At 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , or 8 h into the incubation , 10 U of IL-10 per ml was added .
After 18 h , supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF- « by ELISA .
Data are expressed as percent inhibition of TNF-a release compared with PBMC stimulated in the absence of IL-10 .
IL-10 significantly ( P < 0.001 ) inhibited TNF- « release in response to all stimuli at all time points for except for LPS at 8 b .

Effect of time of administration of IL-10 on TNF- « and IL-18 gene expression .
PBMC ( 5 X 10° ) were stimulated with C. neoformans ( 10 '' ) at time zero , and cells were harvested at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , or 16 h. IL-10 at 10 U/ml was omitted ( - ) or added at 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , or 8 h.

Not shown on the gels , TNF- « and IL-1B messages in unstimulated PBMC were 57 and 65 % , respectively , of the messages seen with PBMC stimulated for 1 h with C. neoformans in the absence of IL-10 , as measured by scanning densitometry .
Results are representative of two experiments .
continued to be seen even when IL-10 was added up to 8 h after cryptococcal stimulation .
In contrast , inhibition of IL-18B message occurred only when IL-10 was added within 2 h of cryptococcal stimulation , and the magnitude of the inhibition was not as great as that seen with TNF-a message .
For C. albicans-stimulated PBMC , 10 U of IL-10 per ml inhibited peak mRNA for TNF- « and IL-1B by 37 and 17 % , respectively .
The experiments described above demonstrate that IL-10 profoundly reduces the amount of TNF- « message in PBMC stimulated by C. neoformans .
We next sought to determine if the reduced message was due to decreased gene transcription or decreased message stability .
PBMC were incubated with C. neoformans or LPS in the presence and absence of IL-10 .
RNA synthesis was stopped by the addition of actinomycin D , and the rate of loss of TNF- « mRNA was evaluated by Northern analysis .
In three independent experiments , the half-life of TNF-a mRNA induced by C. neoformans and LPS was between 30 min and 1 h regardless of whether IL-10 was present .
Thus , the reduced level of TNF- « mRNA seen following IL-10 treatment is not due to decreased TNF- « mRNA stability .
NF-xB .
Nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF- « B is thought to help initiate TNF- « and IL-168 gene transcription ( 22 ) .
The next set of experiments sought to determine if the mechanism of IL-10 inhibition of TNF- « and IL-1B gene expression and release was via inhibition of NF-kB translocation ( Fig .
5 ) .
PBMC were incubated with or without IL-10 in the presence of no stimulus , LPS , C. neoformans , or C. albicans .
After 1 and 4 h , the reaction was terminated and nuclear extracts were analyzed for the presence of translocated NF- « B .
Consistent with previously reported results ( 11 , 13 , 47 ) , NF- « B was found in unstimulated PBMC .
Stimulation of PBMC with LPS , C. neoformans , and C. albicans resulted in increases in the amount of translocated NF- « B at both 1 and 4 h. Addition of 10 U of IL-10 per ml had no significant effect on NF-kB translocation in response to the two fungi at either time point .
However , IL-10 did inhibit LPS-stimulated NF-kB activation at 1 h by 53 % ( mean of four experiments ) .
Depletion of monocytes from PBMC by sequential adherence to plastic and nylon wool totally abolished NF-kB translocation in response to the three stimuli ( data not shown ) .
IL-10 release .
The experiments described above demonstrated the profound effects of IL-10 on PBMC responses to LPS and fungi .
The final set of experiments examined IL-10 production during stimulation of PBMC with LPS , C. neoformans , and C. albicans .
While all three stimuli induced IL-10 release from PBMC , the amount of cytokine released was more than 10-fold less when C. neoformans was the stimulus than when LPS and C. @ ibicans were the stimuli ( Fig .
6 ) .
Moreover , IL-10 release in response to C. neoformans required a high ratio of C. neoformans to PBMC ( 10:1 ) ; at ratios of 2:1 or lower , detectable IL-10 release was not observed ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , at a C. elbicans-to-PBMC ratio of 1:2 , release of IL-10 approached that seen when 100 ng of LPS per ml was used as the stimulus .

Effect of IL-10 on NF- « B nuclear translocation in stimulated PBMC .
PBMC ( 5 x 10° ) were left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng of LPS per ml , C. neoformans ( Cn ; 5 X 10 '' ) , or C. albicans ( Ca , 10 '' ) .
After 1 and 4 h of incubation , nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described in Materials and Methods .
A 25-molar excess of unlabeled probe served as a specific ( Spec . )
competitor .
The top arrow points to NF- « B , while the bottom arrow points to free probe .
The gel shown is representative of three experiments , all of which yielded similar results .
tic fungal pathogens C. neoformans and C. albicans .
IL-10 inhibited release of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF- « and IL-18 from PBMC stimulated by the two fungi , although for TNF- « release , the inhibitory effect of IL-10 was less pronounced when C. albicans was the stimulus .
Our data begin to elucidate the intracellular mechanisms by which IL-10 inhibit TNF- « and IL-18 release in PBMC stimulated by C. neoformans and C. albicans .
By Northern blot analysis , inhibition of TNF-a occurred at or before the transcriptional level .
Similar findings have been reported for LPS-stimulated monocytes ( 10 , 21 , 46 ) .
In contrast , while IL-10 inhibited IL-1B release in C. neoformans-stimulated PBMC by nearly 90 % , it inhibited IL-18 mRNA by only 57 % .
Thus , IL-10 appears to cause inhibition of IL-18B at both the translational and posttranslational levels .
Moreover , IL-10 profoundly inhibited TNF-a and ( to a lesser extent ) IL-1B gene expression in C. neoformans-stimulated PBMC even if added after binding had already occurred .
IL-10 had no significant effects on TNF- « mRNA stability .
Uncoupling of the transcription factor NF-kB from its cyto-plasmic inhibitor IxB is thought to help initiate TNF- « and 2000 __ .

IL-10 release .
PBMC ( 2.5 X 10° ) were left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng of LPS per ml , C. neoformans ( Crypto ; 2.5 X 10° ) , or C. albicans ( Candida ; 5 x 10° ) .
After 18 h , supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-10 by ELISA .
IL-10 release from unstimulated PBMC was below the limits of detection of the assay ( < 10 pg/ml ) .
IL-1B gene transcription , allowing translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus , where it binds to promoter regions on the genes ( 22 ) .
A variety of stimuli , including LPS and , in an autocrine fashion , TNF- « , have been reported to activate NF-kB .
In this study , we found that nuclear translocation of NF- « B occurred in response to C. neoformans and C. albicans but that IL-10 had insignificant effects on NF- « B translocation stimulated by the two fungi .
In contrast , in agreement with recent data from Wang et al .
( 47 ) , IL-10 inhibited NF- « B translocation in response to LPS .
While approximately 50 % inhibition was seen 1 h after stimulation , an effect of IL-10 on LPS-stimulated NF-kB activation was no longer observed at 4 h. Taken to-gether , our data strongly suggest that IL-10 inhibits release of fungus-stimulated TNF- « at the transcriptional level but largely independently of NF-kB .
However , inhibition of LPS-stimulated TNF- « release by IL-10 may be due , at least in part , to inhibition of NF-kB translocation .
The finding that C. neoformans and C. albicans activate NF-kB in PBMC has potential relevance for persons with AIDS .
In addition to its importance as a sentinel event heralding the activation of proinflammatory cytokines , NF-kB activates HIV replication in latently infected cells by binding to NF-kB consensus sequences from the HIV long terminal repeat ( 38 ) .
Thus , the occurrence of cryptococcosis or candidiasis during the course of HIV infection theoretically could accelerate the progression of AIDS by activating viral replication via NF-kB .
We have recently found that induction of NF-kB also occurs in human alveolar macrophages stimulated by C. neoformans ( 2\1a ) .
Disparate results were noted when PBMC responses to LPS , C. neoformans , and C. albicans were compared .
First , TNF-a and IL-18 release occurred at a lower fungus-to-PBMC ratio with C. albicans than with C. neoformans .
Second , IL-10 was a considerably more potent inhibitor of PBMC TNF- « release when C. neoformans and LPS were the stimuli than when C. albicans was the stimulus .
Third , TNF- « gene expression and release occurred later in response to C. neoformans than in response to LPS and C. albicans .
Finally , LPS and C. albicans 950 LEVITZ ET AL .
were considerably more potent stimulators of IL-10 release than was C. neoformans .
The reasons for these disparities are speculative but could relate to different pathways of activation seen in PBMC following exposure to the different stimuli .
For example , in the presence of pooled human serum , monocytes are thought to respond to LPS via CD14 , to C. neoformans via complement receptors , and to C. albicans via complement , immunoglobulin , mannose , and B-glucan receptors ( 3 , 8 , 25 , 29 , 33 , 48 ) .
Regardless of the mechanism , the disparate responses of PBMC to the three stimuli may help explain why the in vivo inflammatory response to each stimulus follows a unique pattern .
Moreover , these results underscore the need for careful study of individual stimuli , as extrapolations can not necessarily be made from one stimulus to another .
Few studies examining the role of IL-10 in eryptococcosis and candidiasis have been published .
In a murine model of cryptococcosis , Huffnagle et al .
found that CD4 deficiency resulted in loss of lung T cells producing Th2 cytokines ( IL-4 , IL-5 , and IL-10 ) , although residual CD8 * cells were still able to produce Th1 cytokines ( IL-2 and gamma interferon ) ( 17 ) .
Ausiello et al .
were unable to detect IL-10 gene expression in human PBMC stimulated with a mannoprotein fraction of C. albicans ( 1 ) .
However , Mencacci et al .
found that CD4 splenocytes from mice immunized with whole C. albicans produced significantly more gamma interferon in response to the mannoprotein fraction when neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies were added to the cultures ( 35 ) .
Moreover , IL-10 was found in the sera of mice 3 days following an intravenous challenge with C. albicans but was undetectable in sera from uninfected controls ( 41 ) .
Suppression of the Th2 response to C. albicans by administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B was associated with reduced amounts of IL-4 and IL-10 and was protective in a murine model of systemic candidiasis ( 41 ) .
IL-10 has been reported to inhibit murine macrophage mi-crobicidal activity against a variety of pathogens , including C. albicans and Schistosoma mansoni ( 4 , 14 ) .
The mechanism is via inhibition of the effector molecule nitric oxide .
However , these results are of questionable relevance for human mononuclear phagocytes , which do not appear to generate sufficient nitric oxide for antimicrobial activity ( 9 , 42 ) .
Consistent with these observations , we have been unable to demonstrate inhibitory or stimulatory effects of IL-10 on the antimicrobial activity of human mononuclear phagocytes against C. neoformans ( 25a ) .
The results reported herein support the experimental use of IL-10 to inhibit release of TNF- « and IL-18 in patients with cryptococcosis and candidiasis .
Our findings demonstrating the ability of IL-10 to shut down cytokine gene expression and release even after fungal challenge has already taken place is an added benefit , especially considering that TNF- « release is delayed following stimulation with fungi compared with endotoxin ( 30 , 34 ) .
Enthusiasm for the use of IL-10 in systemic fungal diseases must be tempered by the findings that in animal models of cryptococcosis and candidiasis , TNF- « appears to be beneficial whereas IL-10 is deleterious ( 4 , 6 , 31 , 41 , 43 ) .
However , in the animal models , antifungal agents were not used .
Thus , one potential approach would be to administer IL-10 to control the inflammatory response and antifungal agents to control the fungus .
A similar approach has been proposed for septic shock ( 15 ) .
