Retinoic Acid Activates Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 Gene Expression in Myeloid Cells By Sampsa Matikainen , Tapani Ronni , Mikko Hurme , Richard Pine , and Ilkka Julkunen All-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .
ATRA induces both in vitro and in vivo differentiation of APL cells into mature granulocytes .
However , the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and cellular differentiation are not presently understood .
The NB4 cell line , which is derived from the bone marrow of a patient with APL during relapse , can be used as a model system to study the growth and differentiation of APL cells .
Because interferon ( IFN ) regulatory factors ( IRF-1 and IRF-2 ) and other IFN-inducible gene products regulate cell growth , we analyzed the effects of ATRA on the expression of these genes .
We show that ATRA directly activates IRF-1 gene expression , followed by activation of IRF-2 and 2'-5 ' oli- LL-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is a potential regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation .
ATRA is a natural and biologically active metabolite of vitamin A .
It modifies gene expression by binding to its specific nuclear receptor .
Several members within two families of retinoid receptors , RAR and RXR , have been cloned , and their structures have been described in detail in a recent review . ''
These receptors belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors , among which are also steroid , mineralocorticoid , thyroid , and vitamin D receptors .
They are ligand-activated transcription factors and affect gene expression directly at the level of transcription . '
Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a form of cancer associated with a 15 ; 17 translocation , where the RAR-a is translocated from chromosome 17 to the promyelocytic leukemia ( pml ) locus on chromosome 15 .
This results in the synthesis of a fusion transcript giving rise to a respective PML/RAR-a fusion protein .
' '' * PML/RAR-a fusion protein can function as a receptor for retinoids and apparently contributes to the leukemogenesis by inhibiting the differentiation of promyelocytes .
It may also promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis , the programed cell death . '' ''
The molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-dependent differentiation are presently not understood .
However , APL cells are responsive to ATRA , which is able to induce differentiation From the Molecular Biology Programme , National Public Health Institute , Helsinki ; the Department of Biomedical Sciences , University of Tampere , Tampere , Finland ; and the Public Health Research Institute , New York , NY .

In addition to NB4 cells , ATRA also activated IRF-1 gene expression in HL-60 , U937 , and THP-1 ceils , which all respond to ATRA by growth inhibition .
A more than additive increase in IRF-1 gene expression was seen with ATRA and IFN-y in NB4 cells .
ATRA did not activate nuclear factor xB or signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) activation pathways , suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in IRF-1 gene activation .
The ATRA-induced expression of IRF-1 , an activator of transcription and repres-sor of transformation , may be one of the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth inhibition , and the basis for the synergistic actions of ATRA and IFNs in myeloid leukemia cells .

of APL cells into mature granulocytes both in vitro and in vivo .
For this reason , ATRA has successfully been used in the treatment of APL .
`` ° The NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cell line is derived from the bone marrow of a patient with an APL during relapse .
This cell line carries the 15 ; 17 translocation and expresses the PML/RAR-a fusion protein . '
In addition to NB4 cells , HL-60 , THP-1 , and U937 cells have been established as useful model systems to study the growth and differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells .
Interferons ( IFNs ) belong to the family of cytokines .
They have antiviral , antiproliferative , and immunomodulatory functions . '' ''
Recent studies have suggested that IFNs and ATRA have synergistic antiproliferative and differentiating actions . '' ''
IFNs have attained wide use in the treatment of several diseases , such as viral hepatitis and various forms of cancer .
The molecular mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative actions of IFNs are still relatively poorly known , even though several IFN-inducible genes like 2'-5 ' oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) , 2'-5 ' oligoadenylate-activated RNAase L , dsRNA-activated protein kinase ( PKR ) , and IFN regulatory factors-1 and -2 ( IRF-1 and IRF-2 ) have been tightly linked to the regulation of cell prolifera-tion .
' '' '' * '' '' Of special interest is that IRF proteins appear to be capable of regulating IFN and IFN-inducible gene expression and cellular proliferation .
IRF-1 functions as a transcriptional activator , whereas IRF-2 functions as a transcriptional repressor . ''
In their N-terminal DNA-binding do-main , IRF-1 and IRF-2 share considerable homology with the p48 protein of the interferon-a stimulated gene factor 3 ( ISGF3 ) complex and the c-myb protein .
'* IRFs and p48 can also bind to partially similar DNA elements in the regulatory regions of IFN-inducible genes . ''
The IRF-1 gene is also constantly deleted in leukemia cells of patients with genomic region 5q-associated leukemias or preleukemic myelodys-plastic syndromes . ''
This suggests that the loss of the functional IRF-1 system may be involved in the development of certain leukemias .
To understand the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced growth inhibition and cellular differentiation , we analyzed the effect of ATRA on IRF and other IFN-inducible gene expression in promyelocytic NB4 cells .

The NB4 cell line was kindly provided by Dr M. Lanotte ( INSERM , Paris , France ) .
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( Flow Laboratories , Irvine , Scotland ) containing 10 mmol/ L HEPES , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , antibiotics , and 10 % fetal calf serum ( GIBCO Life Technologies Ltd , Paisley , Scotland ) ; 70 umol/ L A-mercaptoethanol was added to THP-1 cells as recommended by the ATCC .
For human macrophages , leukocyte-rich buffy-coat fractions were obtained from healthy blood donors from the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Center ( Helsinki , Finland ) , and mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation on a Ficoll Hypaque gradient ( Phar-macia Biotech Inc , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
After washing , the cells were resuspended in fetal calf serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin ( 0.6 pg/mL ) , streptomycin ( 60 ug/mL ) , gluta-mine ( 2 mmol/L ) , and HEPES ( 20 mmol/L ) .
Cells were adhered onto six-well plates ( Falcon , Lincoln Park , NJ ) for 1 hour and then washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline .
Adherent cells were grown for 1 week in Macrophage-SFM medium ( GIBCO Life Technologies Ltd ) in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( 10 ng/mL ) .
Thereafter , more than 90 % of the cells were monocytes/macrophages according to morphology and CD14 expression ( data not shown ) .
Reagents .
ATRA was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co ( St Louis , MO ) .
Human leukocyte IFN-a 6 x 10° IU/mL was kindly provided by Dr Kari Cantell from our Institute .
Human IFN-y 1 x 10°TU/mL was obtained from the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Center and prepared and purified as described elsewhere . ''
Re-combinant human tumor necrosis factor-e ( TNF-a ) was purchased from R & D Systems ( Abingdon , UK ) .
RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis .
- All experiments were performed during the exponential growth phase of the cells .
Cells were treated with various stimuli and harvested at the times indi-cated , and total cellular RNA or polyadenylated ( polyA ) * RNA was isolated .
Total cellular RNA was isolated by guanidium isothiocya-nate lysis of the cells , followed by centrifugation through a CsCl cushion . ''
The ( polyA ) * RNA was bound to oligo ( dT ) -cellulose ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) directly from cell lysates and eluted as described previously . ''
Both total cellular RNA and ( polyA ) * RNA were quantified pho-tometrically , and samples containing equal amounts of total cellular RNA ( 30 ug ) or ( polyA ) * RNA ( 5 ug ) were size-fractionated on 1.0 % formaldehyde-agarose gels , transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) , and hybridized with human IRF-1 , IRF-2 , '' ° and OAS* cDNA probes .
RNA levels in the nylon membranes were also quantified using the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) cDNA probe .
The probes were labeled with [ « -*°P ] dCTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham ) by a random-primed DNA-labeling kit purchased from Boehringer .
Prehybridiza-tions and hybridizations were performed in a solution containing 50 % formamide , 5 % Denhardt solution , 5 % SSPE , and 0.5 % sodium dodecy !
sulfate ( SDS ) .
Filters were washed twice with 1 % SSC ( 1 % SSC is 0.15 mol/L NaCl plus 0.015 mol/L sodium citrate ) plus 0.1 % SDS at room temperature for 30 minutes and once at 60°C for 30 minutes .
The filters were then exposed to Kodak AR X-Omat films ( Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) at -70°C with intensifying screens .
Anti-IRF-1 antibody .
- Subcloning of the human IRF-1 cDNA coding region '' '' into the pGEM3zf ( + ) vector has been described 115 previously . ''
After sequence analysis , the IRF-1 insert was isolated with BamHI and further subcloned into a Bg/lI site of the pGEX2T* ' vector .
The pGEX2T * ' vector is modified from the pGEX2T expression vector ( Pharmacia ) by inserting a linker sequence , GATCCA-AGATCTTG , in the BamHI site of the original pGEX2T vector ( Bglll site underlined ) to change the open reading frame to +1 .
IRF-1 was expressed in E coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) as a glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) fusion protein , and was purified in an 8 % prepara-tive SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( Prep-Cell ; Bio-Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) .
Denatured GST-IRF-1 fusion protein was used to immunize guinea pigs .
Pooled antisera from two guinea pigs was used in the experiments .
It recognized in vitro-translated IRF-1 protein in Western blots and in immunoprecipita-tion .
Nuclear run-off analysis .

Nuclear protein/DNA-binding reactions were performed in a volume of 20 gL containing 5 ug nuclear-extract protein , 10 mmol/L HEPES-KOH , pH 7.9 , 100 mmol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol , 10 % glycerol , and 2 ug poly ( dI-dC ) as a nonspecific competitor .
The 22-bp nuclear factor « B ( NF- « B ) -binding oligonucleotide ( 5-AGTTGAGGG-GACTITCCCAGCC-3 ' ) was purchased from Promega ( Madison , WID ) .
y-Interferon activation stie ( GAS ) ( 5-AGCTTCAGCCTG-ATTTCCCCGAAATGACGGA-3 ' ) , high-affinity C-sis-inducible element ( SIE ) ( 5-GATCTAGGGATTITTCCGGGAAATGAAGCT-3 ' ) , and interferon- stimulated response element 15 ( ISRE15 ) ( 5'-AGCTTGATCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCCA ) oli-gonucleotides were synthesized locally by an Applied Biosystems ( Foster City , CA ) oligonucleotide synthesizer and purified on PAGE in the presence of 8 mol/L urea .
The probes were labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase .
The binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 minutes .
Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4 % nondenaturing low-ionic-strength polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 x TBE ( Tris-borate/EDTA ) .
Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography .
Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting .
- SDS-PAGE was performed with the Laemmli buffer systems . ''
Proteins separated on gels were transferred onto Immobilon-P ( polyvinylidene difluoride ) membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) with an Isophor electrotransfer apparatus ( Hoeffer Scientific Instruments , San Francisco , CA ) at 200 raA for 1 hour .
Primary anti-IRF-1 guinea pig antibodies ( dilution 1:1,000 ) were bound in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 % nonfat milk for 2 hours at room temperature , followed by secondary-antibody ( 1:2,000 dilution ) binding with peroxidase rabbit anti-guinea pig antibodies ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) for 30 minutes at room temperature .
The bands were visualized by an ECL chemilumi-nescence system , as recommended by the manufacturer ( Amersham ) .
Concentrations of protein samples were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit .
RESULTS Expression of IRF-1 , IRF-2 , and OAS genes in promyelocytic NB4 cells in response to ATRA .
IRF-1 , a transcriptional activator , and IRF-2 , a transcriptional repressor , are involved in the regulation of IFN- $ and IFN-inducible gene expression and cellular transformation . ''
Since ATRA is a potent inducer of cellular differentiation of promyelocytic cells , we wanted to determine whether it has an effect on IRF-1 , IRF-2 , or IFN-inducible OAS gene expression .
Therefore , we treated promyelocytic NB4 cells with 1 Lmol/ L ATRA , collected cells at different time points after induc- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

IRF-1 mRNA levels were clearly elevated already 1 hour after ATRA treatment , steadily increasing thereafter and staying at constant elevated levels up to 72 hours ( Fig 1 ) .
The data suggest that IRF-1 gene expression is directly induced by ATRA .

showed higher basal levels in NB4 cells as compared with IRF-1 mRNA levels .
ATRA apparently had no direct effect on IRF-2 steady-state mRNA levels at early time points after ATRA induction .
However , IRF-2 mRNA levels increased 6 hours after ATRA treatment , but the induction remained at a lower level as compared with that seen for the IRF-1 gene ( Fig 1 ) .
Basal OAS mRNA expression was at an undetectable level in NB4 cells .
A clear increase in steady-state OAS mRNA levels was found starting at 24 hours , markedly increasing thereafter up to 72 hours after ATRA treatment ( Fig 1 ) .
IRF-1 mRNA levels are rapidly upregulated by ATRA in myeloblastic HL-60 cells .
HL-60 cells are myeloblastic leukemia cells that acquire granulocyte-like characteristics in response to ATRA . ''
To see whether IRF-1 mRNA production was activated by ATRA in HL-60 cells as in NB4 cells , we treated HL-60 cells with 1 mol/L ATRA , collected cells at different time points after induction , and analyzed steady-state IRF-1 mRNA levels by Northern blotting .
IRF-1 mRNA levels were clearly elevated already 1 hour after ATRA treatment ( Fig 2 ) , and at 3 hours IRF-1 mRNA levels were approximately threefold and eightfold higher as compared with basal levels in HL-60 and NB4 cells , respectively , as analyzed by densitometric scanning .
IRF-1 mRNA levels are rapidly upregulated by ATRA in monocytic cells .
To see whether induction of IRF-1 gene expression by ATRA is also a common feature in other cell types , we studied the effect of ATRA on steady-state IRF-1 mRNA levels in THP-1 and U937 cell lines , as well as in human primary macrophages .
THP-1 and U937 cells are myeloid leukemia cells committed for monocytic differentiation , and they acquire a more monocytic phenotype in response to treatment with ATRA . ''
Northern blot analysis of poly ( A ) '' mRNA showed that basal levels of IRF-1 mRNA were readily detectable in THP-1 cells .
As in NB4 and HL-60 cells ( Figs 1 and 2 ) , IRF-1 mRNA levels increased starting from 1 hour after ATRA treatment , whereas IRF-2 gene expression showed slower kinetics of activation ( Fig 3 ) .

from U937 cells and human macrophages indicated that ATRA also rapidly activates IRF-1 gene expression in these cells ( Fig 4 ) .
Based on densitometric scanning , a sevenfold induction ( U937 cells ) and 2.5-fold induction ( human macro-phages ) was seen 2 hours after ATRA treatment as compared with basal IRF-1 mRNA levels .
This suggests that ATRA also directly upregulates IRF-1 gene expression in myeloid leukemia cells committed for monocytic differentiation , and also to a lesser extent in primary macrophages .
ATRA activates IRF-1 gene expression in the absence of protein synthesis .
- To study whether ongoing protein synthesis was required for ATRA-induced IRF-1 gene expression , we treated NB4 cells with ATRA in the presence and absence of cycloheximide .
The concentration used ( 100 g/ mL ) is capable of fully blocking protein synthesis in human leukocytes . ''
NB4 cells were collected at 2 hours posttreat- 117 ment , total cellular RNA was isolated , and steady-state IRF-1 mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern blotting .
Even in the presence of cycloheximide , IRF-1 mRNA levels were strongly elevated by ATRA ( Fig 5 ) , suggesting that the IRF-1 gene is a primary target gene for ATRA .
Consistent with previous observations , '' * '' ® cycloheximide treatment of cells resulted in slightly higher steady-state IRF-1 mRNA levels as compared with control cells .
Effect of ATRA on IRF-1 mRNA levels occurs at the transcriptional level .
_ To further study transcriptional activation of the IRF-1 gene by ATRA , we performed a nuclear runoff analysis .
Figure 6 shows that the IRF-1 gene transcription rate was greatly enhanced at 1 hour after ATRA treatment and rapidly diminished thereafter .

Samples ( 30 ug ) were fractionated on agarose gels , transferred to nylon membranes , and then hybridized to the IRF-1 and GAPDH cDNA probes .
vated IRF-1 mRNA levels in ATRA-treated cells are at least partly due to an increased IRF-1 gene transcription rate .
ATRA activates IRF-1 protein expression in NB4 cells .
To see whether the increased IRF-1 gene expression would also lead to corresponding increases in the respective protein levels , we performed Western blot analyses with IRF-1-specific antibodies .
IRF-1 protein levels are already higher 2 hours after ATRA treatment , indicating that elevated IRF-1 mRNA levels also lead to higher intracellular levels of IRF-1 protein ( Fig 7 ) .
IFN-induced IRF-1 mRNA and protein expression in NB4 cells .
To study in more detail the kinetics of IFN-a « - and IFN-y-induced IRF-1 mRNA expression , we treated NB4 cells with IFN-a ( 1,000 IU/mL ) and IFN-y ( 100 IU/mL ) for the indicated times and analyzed IRF-1 mRNA expression .
Both IFN-a ( 1,000 IU/mL ) and IFN-y ( 100 IU/mL ) induced IRF-1 mRNA expression 2 hours postinduction ( Fig 10A ) .
However , the kinetics of IFN- « - and IFN-y-induced mRNA expression was significantly different .
IFN- « induced a transient IRF-1 mRNA expression , whereas IFN-y-induced IRF-1 mRNA stayed at constant elevated levels up to 24 hours ( Fig 8A ) .
To see whether IFN- « - and IFN-y-induced IRF-1 MATIKAINEN ET AL mRNA levels would also lead to corresponding increases in the respective protein levels , we performed Western blot analyses with specific anti-IRF-1 antibodies .
Protein levels are already higher 2 hours after IFN-a and IFN-y treatment , indicating that IFN-induced elevated IRF-1 mRNA levels lead to higher intracellular levels of this transcription factor ( Fig 10B ) .
Elevated IRF-1 protein levels were observed after both IFN-a and IFN-y induction and appeared to persist up to 72 hours ( Fig 8B ) .
Effect of IFN-a , IFN-y , and ATRA on signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) and NF-kB DNA-binding activities in NB4 cells .
The expression of IFN-inducible genes is primarily controlled by STAT and IRF transcription factors .
IFN-a and especially IFN-y are able to activate and induce the binding of STAT 1a to GAS elements in the promoter regions of IFN-y-inducible genes , '' such as IRF-1.5° Since ATRA was able to induce IRF-1 gene expression in NB4 cells , we wanted to analyze whether ATRA is able to induce GAS DNA-binding activity in these cells .
We also stimulated NB4 cells with high-dose IFN-a ( 1,000 IU/mL ) and IFN-y ( 1,000 IU/mL ) and studied the GAS DNA-binding activities .
IFN-a induced a transient increase in GAS DNA-binding activity , with maximal activity seen at 30 minutes ( Fig 9 ) .
In contrast , IFN-y stimulation of NB4 cells resulted in a stable GAS DNA-binding activity that was still clearly visible at 24 hours postinduction .
We also used a high-affinity SIE oligonucleotide as a probe in EMSA , since the SIE sequence also binds IFN- « - and IFN-y-activated transcription factor STAT3 ( and STAT1a ) . ''
IFN-a « - and IFN-y-induced SIE DNA-binding activity was kinetically and qualitatively similar to that seen by the GAS probe ( Fig 9 ) .
Stimulation of cells with ATRA for different times and analysis of nuclear extracts for GAS or SIE DNA-binding activity ( Fig 10 ) suggested that STAT proteins are unlikely to be involved in ATRA-induced IRF-1 , IRF-2 , or OAS gene expression , since no enhanced DNA-binding was observed .
The transcription factor NF- « B has been suggested to be involved in controlling the expression of IFN-inducible genes .
For example , TNF-a , a known activator of NF-KB , is able to induce IRF-1 gene expression in many types of cells , '' '' and NF-KB binding sites have been identified in the promoter region of the IRF-1 gene . ''

Western blot analysis of IRF-1 protein expression in ATRA-treated NB4 cells .
NB4 cells were stimulated with 1 pmol/L ATRA , after which cells were collected at the time points indicated .
Protein samples ( 30 ug ) were separated on 10 % SDS-PAGE , and Western blots were stained with IRF-1-specific antibodies .
In vitro ( In v. ) translated IRF-1 as a positive control .
80 49 we performed EMSAs with an oligonucleotide containing the consensus NF- « kB DNA-binding site .
TNF-a , which was used as a positive control , induced NF-kB DNA-binding activity in NB4 cells ( Fig 10 ) , whereas ATRA did not increase any NF- « B DNA-binding activity .
This suggests that NF-KB is most likely not involved in ATRA-induced activation of IRF-1 , IRF-2 , or OAS genes in NB4 cells .
Basal NF-kB DNA-binding instead seemed to decrease during ATRA treatment ( Fig 10 ) .
Synergistic activation of IRF-1 gene expression by ATRA and IFN-y .
- Since ATRA can induce IRF-1 gene expression by a pathway that is independent of STAT- or NF- « B-mediated pathways ( Fig 10 ) , we studied whether ATRA synergistically or additively increased IFN-y-activated IRF-1 gene expression .
Therefore , we treated NB4 cells with low-dose IFN-y ( 1 or 10 IU/mL ) with or without ATRA and analyzed steady-state IRF-1 mRNA levels at 3 hours postinduction ( Fig 11 ) .
ATRA alone induced the IRF-1 gene at levels comparable to those induced by 1 IU/mL IFN-y .
With different doses of IFN-y ( 1 and 10 IU/mL ) , there appeared to be a more than additive effect with ATRA ( Fig 11 ) on IRF-1 mRNA levels .

They can inhibit cellular proliferation , and they have a clear differentiating effect on cells .
Relatively little is known about retinoic acid-induced target genes that would be involved in regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation .
In the case of IFNs , more information is available and several genes directly regulated by IFNs have been associated with inhibition of cell growth .
IRF-1 and IRF-2 , transcription activator and repressor , respectively , have linked the IFN system directly to the control of cell growth .
The levels and ratios of IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNA and protein fluctuate during the cell cycle .
IRF-1 levels are lowest during growth stimulation and highest at growth arrest . ''
Experiments with IRF-1~~ cells obtained from knockout mice suggest that IRF-1 is an antioncogenic protein and is also required for induction of apoptosis .
**~* In addition , IRF-1 protein can counteract cellular transformation induced by IRF-2 overexpression . ''
The present knowledge of IRF-1 protein suggests that it is tightly linked to the regulation of cell growth .

'* '' ° In the present report , we demonstrate that in promyelocytic NB4 leukemia cells , retinoic acid ( ATRA ) can directly upregulate IRF-1 gene expression .
The increased IRF-1 gene expression is followed by increased expression of other IFN-inducible genes , namely IRF-2 and OAS , but with clearly slower kinetics .
Several different stimuli may enhance IRF-1 gene expression .
Viruses , '' * '' '' dsRNA , IFNs , and several other cyto-kines*** ' have been shown to directly transcriptionally activate IRF-1 gene expression .
Detailed analysis of the IRF-1 promoter** '' has shown that the promoter has a functional GAS element ( at position -120 ) that is bound by activated STAT 1a . ''
Pine et al '' ® recently ( 1994 ) also showed by using IRF-1 promoter reporter constructs that in HeLa cells IFN-y induces an eightfold increase , in contrast to a twofold increase with IFN- .
Consistent with these promoter studies , we also observed that in NB4 cells IFN-y was a much better inducer of IRF-1 gene expression than IFN- .
IL-6 can activate the transcription factor STAT3 , and to a lesser degree STAT1a .
`` `` '' *° It was recently shown that IL-6-induced IRF-1 gene expression is mediated via a GAS element but also via another closely related sequence element , pIRE . ''
IL-1 and TNF-a can also upregulate IRF-1 gene expres-sion , '' ' but the molecular mechanisms of this activation have not been revealed so far .

- Synergistic effect of IFN-y and ATRA in IRF-1 gene expression .
NB4 cells were treated with IFN-y , ATRA , or a combination of the 2 as indicated .
Cells were collected 3 hours after induction , total cellular RNA was isolated , and 30-ug samples were separated on 1 % agarose gels .
After transfer to nylon membrane , the filter was hybridized with IRF-1 and GAPDH cDNAs .
NF-KB is involved in IL-1/TNF-a « -activated IRF-1 gene expression .
Herein , we demonstrate that ATRA induces IRF-1 gene expression in a retinoic acid-sensitive , promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cell line .
Similar induction , although weaker , was also seen in HL-60 , THP-1 , and U937 cells , as well as in human primary macrophages .
These leukemic cells respond to ATRA by growth inhibition , suggesting that IRF-1 could be involved in mediating growth-inhibitory effects of ATRA .
Elevated IRF-1 mRNA levels were seen very early , already at 1 hour after ATRA induction , suggesting that IRF-1 is a primary target gene in ATRA-induced re-sponse .
Induction of IRF-1 gene expression was also observed in the absence of protein synthesis ( Fig 6 ) , and nuclear runoff experiments ( Fig 5 ) also indicated direct transcriptional activation .
This suggests that the IRF-1 gene is a direct target for ATRA-induced gene activation .
This observation is the first to directly link ATRA response to the activation of a potentially antioncogenic gene .
Analysis of known transcription factors involved in cytokine signaling suggests that ATRA does not induce any detectable GAS ( STAT1a ) , SIE ( STAT3 and STATla ) , or NF-kB DNA-binding activities ( Fig 9 ) .
This strongly argues against these transcription factors ' being involved in IRF-1 and other 121 IFN-inducible ( IRF-2 and OAS ) gene expression in ATRA-induced NB4 cells .
It is tempting to speculate that ATRA-induced IRF-1 gene expression occurs directly via the retinoic acid receptor bound to IRF-1 gene promoter , and is thus distinct from the STAT and NF-kB pathways .
This may indeed be the case , since computer analysis indicated a putative retinoic acid receptor binding site in the promoter of IRF-1 gene ( from -455 to -440 ) .
Detailed promoter deletion , mutagenesis , and transient-expression experiments will reveal whether this element really is a functional retinoic acid receptor binding and activation site .
IRF-1 protein is a transcriptional activator capable of binding to at least IFN-/3 promoter and to ISRE-like elements in the regulatory regions of IFN-inducible genes .
`` `` * '' '' Possibly upon activation or if IRF-1 concentration in the cell is in-creased , it can outcompete transcriptional repressors , such as IRF-2 , from the promoter regions of IFN-inducible genes . ''
IRF-1 protein has been shown to be involved in the transcription of a number of genes including OAS , IRF-2 , inducible nitric oxidase synthetase ( iNOS ) , guanylate-bind-ing protein ( GBP ) , and major histocompatibility genes , all of which are under the transcriptional control of IFNs .
`` > ° It seems to be absolutely essential at least for the transcription of GBP and iNOS genes .
`` `` '' ° In the present study , we analyzed gene expression of IRF-2 and OAS in response to ATRA .
Unlike IRF-1 , which was activated very rapidly , already within 1 hour after ATRA treatment , IRF-2 and OAS mRNA levels were found to be elevated several hours later in NB4 cells .
IRF-2 mRNA levels were found to be elevated starting at 3 to 6 hours after ATRA treatment , whereas OAS mRNA levels were found to be strongly elevated much later , at 24 to 72 hours after ATRA treatment .
However , basal OAS mRNA levels were undetectable in NB4 cells .
The kinetics of the expression fits well with the idea that IRF-2 and possibly also OAS gene expression is enhanced by IRF-1 protein .
IRF-2 gene has been shown to be responsive to IFNs .
`` `` * '' IRF-2 promoter analysis has also revealed a functional IRF-1 binding site and IRF-1-dependent transcriptional activation of the respective gene . ''
In ATRA-stimu-lated NB4 cells , the increased IRF-2 gene expression does not appear to lead to a shutdown of IFN-inducible genes , since steady-state OAS mRNA levels were in fact increased during follow-up evaluation .
ATRA has been shown to be effective in the treatment of APL .
It induces an irreversible commitment of cells to differentiate , and it may also induce apoptosis in maturing APL cells ATRA may also be a necessary activator or cofactor in the differentiation process of many cell types .
The molecular mechanisms behind retinoic acid-induced differentiation and inhibition of cell growth have been largely unknown .
In the present report , we provide evidence that the IRF-1 gene , a potential candidate gene for antioncogenic functions , is upregulated during ATRA induction of leukemic cells .
It remains to be seen whether similar mechanisms are also involved in other forms of cancer .
