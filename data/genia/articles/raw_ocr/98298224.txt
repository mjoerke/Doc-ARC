Coactivation by OCA-B : Definition of Critical Regions and Synergism with General Cofactors YAN LUO , HUI GE , f SEAN STEVENS , HUA XIAO , anp ROBERT G. ROEDER* Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , The Rockefeller University , New York , New York 10021-6399 Received 2 February 1998/Returned for modification 20 March 1998/Accepted 22 April 1998 Molecular dissection of the B-cell-specific transcription coactivator OCA-B has revealed distinct regions important , respectively , for recruitment to immunoglobulin promoters through interaction with octamer-bound Oct-1 and for subsequent coactivator function .
Further analysis of general coactivator requirements showed that selective removal of PC4 from the essential USA fraction severely impairs Oct-1 and OCA-B function in a cell-free system reconstituted with partially purified factors .
Full activity can be restored by the combined action of recombinant PC4 and the PC4-depleted USA fraction , thus suggesting a joint requirement for PC4 and another , USA-derived component ( s ) for optimal function of Oct-1/OCA-B in the reconstituted system .
Indeed , USA-derived PC2 was found to act synergistically with PC4 in reproducing the function of intact USA in the assay system .
Consistent with the requirement for PC4 in the reconstituted system , OCA-B was found to interact directly with PC4 .
Surprisingly , however , removal of PC4 from the unfractionated nuclear extract has no detrimental effect on OCA-B/Oct-1-dependent transcription .
These results lead to a general model for the synergistic function of activation domains in Oct-1 and OCA-B ( mediated by the combined action of the multiple USA components ) and , further , suggest a functional redundancy in general coactivators .
The B-cell-specific function of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) promoters is mediated by an octamer element ( ATTTGCAT ) and was thought originally to be regulated by an octamer-binding factor ( Oct-2 ) enriched in lymphoid cells ( reviewed in reference 51 ) .
However , early biochemical analyses indicated that Ig promoters could function equally well with Oct-2 or the ubiquitous Oct-1 and that B-cell-specific promoter function was determined by a B-cell-specific Oct-l-associated coactivator designated OCA-B ( 30 , 41 ) .
These studies established a new paradigm for cell-specific promoter activation that involves recruitment of the true regulatory factor to the cell-specific promoter element through interaction with a ubiquitous DNA binding factor .
Subsequent genetic analyses confirmed that Oct-2 was nonessential for Ig promoter activation but failed to identify the responsible B-cell-specific factor ( 6-8 ) .
The discovery of OCA-B set the stage for cloning of a cognate cDNA on the basis of biochemical purification ( 31 ) and yeast genetic screens ( 13 , 54 ) , which , in turn , facilitated both genetic and biochemical analyses of OCA-B .
Targeted gene disruption data ( 19 , 39 , 50 ) revealed that OCA-B is essential for normal patterns of Ig expression , most notably antigen-dependent responses leading to secondary isotype production , but not for antigen-independent Ig gene transcription events that might conceivably employ other Oct-1 coactivators .
Biochemical studies with recombinant OCA-B have confirmed the originally suggested mechanisms by showing that the highly related POU domains ( reviewed in references 15 , 16 , and 45-48 ) of Oct-1 and Oct-2 , but not that of Oct-3 , are sufficient for OCA-B interaction and promoter recruitment ( 13 , 31 , 54 ) .
More recent studies have shown that OCA-B also contacts octamer nucleotides through the major groove in the * Corresponding author .

3803 DNA-Oct-1-OCA-B complex ( 2 , 4 ) , consistent with a stronger OCA-B interaction with Oct-1 or Oct-2 in the presence of DNA ( 31 ) .
Further , the demonstration that OCA-B can discriminate among octamer variants for formation of the higher-order ternary complex provided a mechanism for differential activation of octamer-containing promoters ( 4 , 14 ) , whereas the inability of OCA-B to stimulate the histone 2B ( H2B ) promoter ( 31 ) , which contains a functional octamer element identical to the consensus Ig promoter element , requires a different explanation .
Finally , while corresponding POU domains are sufficient for OCA-B recruitment to Ig promoters and for normal octamer-mediated transcription from the H2B promoter , an additional Oct-1 or Oct-2 activation domain ( s ) is necessary for functional synergy with OCA-B and corresponding activation of Ig promoters ( 31 ) .
When assayed in more purified reconstituted system , Ig promoter activation by OCA-B and Oct-1 also required the general coactivator fraction USA in addition to the general initiation factors ( 31 ) .
The availability of recombinant OCA-B and in vitro assay systems with general initiation factors ( reviewed in reference 44 ) and cofactors ( reviewed in reference 18 ) prompt questions about structure-function relationships in relation to its interaction both with Oct-1 ( upstream interactions ) and , poten-tially , with components of the general transcription machinery ( downstream interactions ) .
As predicted from our previous model invoking separate domains for these interactions ( 31 ) , mutant OCA-B defective in either interaction would , in prin-ciple , lead to defects in coactivation function .
This scenario is reminiscent of that described for the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) ( co ) activator VP16 , which was reported to interact with promoter-bound Oct-1 through the POU domain ( e.g. , 26 , 43 ) ; have a conditional DNA binding activity ( 25 , 52 , but see reference 58 ; reviewed in references 5 and 15 ) , a property shared by OCA -B ( 2 , 4 ) ; and provide an activation function .
From this point of view , OCA-B may represent a class of cellular counterparts of viral coactivators ( see Discussion ) .
In this report , we first show functional analyses of wild-type OCA-B versus mutant derivatives to define domains critical for upstream versus downstream interactions .
We then present a 3804 LUO ET AL .
further definition of general cofactor requirements for the proper function of Oct-1 and OCA-B in a reconstituted system .
Finally , we use OCA-B mutants to establish a functional linkage between OCA-B and general cofactors .
MATERIALS AND METHODS In vitro transcription .
For transcription in nuclear extracts , conditions described by Luo et al .
( 30 ) and Luo and Roeder ( 31 ) were used .
The reaction mixtures ( 25 pl ) contained 5 pl of transcription premix ( 200 mM HEPES [ pH 8.4 ] ; 15 mM MgCl , , 3 mM each ATP , GTP , CTP , and UTP ; 20 mM dithiothre-itol , 40 U of RNasin ) ; 5 pl of H , O containing 500 ng of the BCL , ( 27 ) IgH template ( 41 ) and , when indicated , 50 ng of the 2xSp1 template ( 42 ) ; and 15 pl of a mixture of nuclear extract maintained in BC100 ( 30 ; typically , 10 wl ) and various amounts of cofactor OCA-B maintained in BC100-250-ug/ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) with compensating volumes of the same buffer .
For transcription in a reconstituted system , the nuclear extract-OCA-B mixture mentioned above was replaced with TFII-A , -B , -D , and -E/F/H plus RNA polymerase II and other factor and cofactor components specified in the figures and legends .
Factors in this system were stabilized by 1.5-mg/ml BSA .
All of the in vitro transcription reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 60 min , and transcripts were measured by primer extension .
Purification of factors and cofactors .
Proteins were maintained in the BC buffers described by Luo et al .
( 30 ) .
Numbers following BC indicate millimolar KCI concentrations .
Highly purified factors and cofactors ( in BC100 ) were stabilized with 250-pug/ml BSA .
Oct-1 ( glycosylated ) was purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by using a combination of wheat germ agglutinin and octamer binding site affinity columns as described by Picrani et al .
( 41 ) .
General transcription factors and cofactors were prepared as described by Ge et al .
( 10 ) and Kretzschmar et al .
( 24 ) .
Recombinant wild-type and mutant OCA-B proteins were expressed as six-His-tagged proteins ( vector 6His-pET11d ; reference 17 ) in Escherichia coli and purified .
Recombinant PC4 was expressed and purified as described by Ge et al .
( 10 ) .
Immunodepletion of PC4 .
Immunodepletion of PC4 was carried out at 4°C .
The USA fraction from the heparin-Sepharose step ( see reference 34 ; 0.4 ml in BC100 , diluted to 2 ml with BC600 ) was passed several times through a 0.4-ml protein A-agarose column equilibrated in BC500 .
Half of the flowthrough fraction served as a source of mock-depleted USA .
The other half was passed several times through a 0.2-ml anti-PC4 affinity column equilibrated in BC500 .
Both the final flowthrough fraction from the protein A column and that from the anti-PC4 column were dialyzed to BC100 , concentrated ( about fivefold ) by ultrafiltration ( Amicon , Inc. ) , and used as mock-depleted and PC4-depleted USA fractions in transcription assays .
The extent of depletion was monitored by immunoblotting various fractions with anti-PC4 sera ( see Fig .
3A ) .
Removal of PC4 from HeLa nuclear extract was carried out by a similar protocol , except for the omission of the initial dilution and final concentration steps .
Anti-PC4 antibodies were raised against a protein containing full-length PC4 fused to glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) .
Specific anti-PC4 antibodies were purified from crude antisera by using an immunogen affinity column .
The purified antibodies were then cross-linked to protein A-agarose , yielding an anti-PC4 affinity column .
Protein-protein interaction assays .
To detect a protein ( s ) that can specifically bind to the wild-type OCA-B activation domain , GST and a GST-OCA-B fusion protein ( containing residues 171 to 256 in wild-type and mutant B OCA-B ; Fig .
1 ) were expressed in £ .
coli and then purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads .
Subsequently , aliquots of HeLa nuclear extract in BC100 were passed through the resultant beads equilibrated in BC100 .
After extensive washing of the resins with BC100 , the bound proteins were eluted by BC1000 .
The eluates were analyzed by multiple immunoblots using available antisera against various general factors and cofactors ; PC4 was the sole polypeptide detected by immu-noblotting .
Analysis of the in vivo function of OCA-B and derived mutants by transfec-tion .
cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutant ( A , B , and A/B ) OCA-B proteins were subcloned into mammalian expression vector pRC ( Invitrogen ) .
These effector constructs were cotransfected with a reporter gene ( luciferase in vector pGL3 ; Promega ) under the control of the BCL , ( 27 ) IgH promoter .
The transfection analyses were carried out with HeLa cells by using conventional calcium phosphate methods , and cells were harvested after 48 h. Extracts were prepared by using reporter lysis buffer ( Promega ) , and expression was assayed in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions .
In cach case , assays were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and a constant amount of the vector CMVBgal was added as an internal control for transfection efficiency .
The expression vector levels were titrated carefully , and the amounts used for the data included here were within the linear range for activation .
Western blot analyses indicated that the OCA-B cDNA and the various mutant forms were expressed at similar levels ( data not shown ) .

( A ) A simple linear description of the OCA-B molecule .
The 256-residue polypeptide is rich in proline ( ~16 % ; for the complete sequence , see references 13 , 31 , and 54 ) .
Relevant putative functional domains include domain A ( with its sequence alignment with an E1A segment shown ) and domain B ( with acidic residues marked by asterisks ) .
The mutant forms of OCA-B used in this study are also described .
The mutant proteins were made by a PCR-based strategy .
( B ) Protein profile of bacterially expressed , 6His-tagged wild-type OCA-B and mutant forms of OCA-B .
A roughly calculated 0.1 ng each of the proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-OCA-B antibodies .
( Given that all three mutant proteins may have lost some epitopes compared to the wild type , the amounts of the mutant proteins might be slightly underes-timated .
Nevertheless , this underestimation would not complicate our analyses of , and the conclusions made about , these mutant proteins . )
The amounts used for the in vitro transcription analyses in Fig .
2 were based on this estimation .
RESULTS Molecular dissection of OCA-B .
In addition to being rich in proline ( ~16 % ) , a characteristic of a number of transcription factors ( reviewed in reference 35 ) , OCA-B displays a weak sequence similarity to the viral coactivator E1A ( 31 ; domain A in Fig .
1A ) and contains a putative acidic activation domain ( domain B in Fig .
1A ) reminiscent of that of coactivator VP16 ( 56 ) .
To explore the possibility that these domains are important for OCA-B function , three OCA-B mutants were made as described in the legend to Fig .
1 .
The A mutant protein has domain A ( amino acids [ aa ] 4 to 18 ) deleted , the B mutant protein has the acidic stretch neutralized , and the A/B mutant protein is a combinatorial double mutant protein .
For in vitro analyses , wild-type OCA-B and the mutant forms of OCA-B were expressed in and purified from bacteria ( Fig .
1B ) ; they then were tested for the ability to stimulate an Ig heavy-chain ( IgH , BCL , [ 27 ] ) reporter promoter in a HeLa cell nuclear extract .
In a dose-response experiment ( Fig .
2A ) , all three mutant proteins showed reduced transcriptional activity compared to wild-type OCA-B .
To analyze in vivo functions , HeLa cells were cotransfected with the BCL , IgH promoter reporter and cytomegalovirus-driven expression vectors .
As expected , the in vivo activities of the wild-type and mutant OCA-B proteins on the IgH promoter paralleled those observed in vitro ( Fig .
2B ) .
Both in vivo ( Fig .
2B ) and in vitro ( Fig .
2A ) , the defect in the combinatorial A/B mutant protein was more severe than that of either the A or the B mutant protein .

Analyses of wild-type ( Wt ) OCA-B and mutant ( Mut . )
forms of OCA-B .
( A ) In vitro transcription assay .
As indicated , three doses of wild-type OCA-B and mutant OCA-B ( respectively , 10 ng [ lanes 2 , 5 , 8 , and 11 ] ; 20 ng [ lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ] , and 50 ng [ lanes 4 , 7 , 10 , and 13 ] ) were used in the titration experiment to complement a HeLa nuclear extract ( 10 pl for each reaction ) .
The transcripts were analyzed by primer extension as described by Luo and Roeder ( 31 ) .
Lane 1 ( - ) was a control ( without the addition of OCA-B or its derivatives ) .
Transcription activation levels ( by the middle point dosage of OCA-B , i.e. , 20 ng ; an amount equivalent to that of the endogenous OCA-B present in 10 pl of the B-cell [ Nam ] nuclear extract ) , compared to lane 1 ( taken as 1 ) , are 8 , 2.7 , 2.2 , and 1.4 , respectively , for the wild type and the B , A , and A/B mutant proteins ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ; also , see the fold stimulation shown under each corresponding lane ) .
( B ) In vivo ( transfection ) assay .
An IgH reporter promoter construct ( with the promoter inserted in front of the luciferase gene ) was cotransfected with effector constructs ( expressing OCA-B or its mutants under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter ) in HeLa cells .
Relative IgH promoter activation levels were scored by measuring the light units of the extracts of the transfected cells 48 h posttransfection normalized to B-galactosidase controls .
Taking the level with no effector as 1 , the relative levels are 12 , 4 , 3 , and 2 , respectively , for the wild type and the B , A , and A/B mutant proteins .
The mutant OCA-B proteins were expressed at levels similar to that of the wild-type protein in transfected cells , as assessed by immunoblotting with anti-OCA-B antibodies ( data not shown ) .
( C ) Octamer DNA-POU-1 complex supershift assay .
POU-1 is a truncated version of Oct-1 containing only the POU domain , sufficient to bind OCA-B either in solution or when on DNA ( e.g. , reference 31 ) .
The supershift condition was the same as that described by Luo and Roeder ( 31 ) , except that approximately 25-fold less OCA-B ( or its mutants ) was used , such that only a portion of the binary complex was supershifted .
To obtain the highest possible resolution , the free probe ( a labeled DNA fragment containing the IgH octamer site ) was allowed to run out of the gel .
As can be seen , the B mutant protein ( lane 3 ) retained the ability to form the higher-order complex , which was even denser than that formed with the wild type ( lane 2 ) for a reason we do not know , whereas the A mutant protein ( lane 4 ) lost the capacity to bind the binary complex .
Given that the combinatorial A/B mutant protein ( lane 5 ) could give rise to the formation of a residual level of the ternary complex , it is possible that the introduction of the B mutant protein created a conformational change that can increase the POU-OCA-B interaction even with domain A deleted .
We emphasize that such a complication in the binding assay did not complicate our in vitro transcription analyses and conclusions .
( D ) Test of dominant negative potentials of wild-type OCA-B and its mutant forms .
Eight microliters of B-cell ( Nam ) nuclear extract was used for each reaction ( there is ~2 ng of endogenous OCA-B per pl in this nuclear extract [ see above ] ) .
The nuclear extract was supplemented with either BC100 buffer ( lane 1 ) or , as indicated , recombinant wild-type or mutant OCA-B ( ~100 ng , for a molar ratio of ~6:1 over the endogenous OCA-B ) in BC100 ( lanes 2 to 5 ) .
The transcripts were analyzed as described for panel A. Quantitation of the activation levels is indicated in the figure legends .
These mutant B results suggest that domain B is a major activation domain of the OCA-B molecule .
Further confirming this notion is the fact that while a Gal4 ( 1-94 ) -OCA-B fusion protein functions as an activator on promoters containing Gal4 binding sites , a mutant protein with a deletion encompassing domain B loses the activation capability ( 53 ) .
However , our mutant B results differ somewhat from those reported by Gstaiger et al .
( 14 ) , who found that large C-terminal deletions ( aa 193 to 256 and 123 to 256 ) had no detrimental effects on the coactivation function of OCA-B in transfection assays .
Furthermore , in our transfection assays , even a smaller C-terminal deletion in OCA-B ( aa 209 to 256 ; a deletion encompassing domain B ) was found to impair the coactivation function of OCA-B ( 53 ) .
One explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the more extensive C-terminal deletion mutant proteins of Gstaiger et al. , which still had activation function in their assay , may have also lost an intrinsic inhibitory domain that normally masks an otherwise silent activation function ( residing between residues 66 and 122 ) .
Alternatively , it is possible that in the transfection assays of Gstaiger et al. , the effectors were overexpressed , amplifying minor activation domains whose effects normally would not be observed .
In agreement with the second possibility , similar mutant proteins , when carefully titrated , were , in fact , defective in our studies ( 53 ) .
Artificial coactivation by OCA-B or its derivatives ( when in excess ) may also result from their less functionally relevant interactions with DNA or with the basal machinery .
Thus , high doses of the A and B mutant proteins and , to a lesser extent , the A/B mutant protein cause detectable stimulation in vitro and in vivo ( 53 ) .
This is exemplified in Fig .
2A , which shows that the largest amounts of mutant OCA-B had measurable effects .
The wild-type and mutant OCA-B proteins were next checked for the ability to supershift a complex containing an octamer element and the DNA binding ( POU ) domain of Oct-1 in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( Fig .
2C ) .
In agreement with the idea that domain A provides a determinant for POU domain interaction , its deletion essentially abrogated the ability of OCA-B to form the ternary complex ( compare lane 4 , Mut .
A , to lane 2 , Wt ) .
This observation suggests that the coactivation defect of mutant A is due largely to its lack of an upstream interaction with Oct-1 .
In contrast , the B region 3806 LUO ET AL .
mutation actually enhanced the ability of OCA-B to bind to the DNA-POU-1 complex ( compare lane 3 , Mut .
B , to lane 2 , Wt ) .
The reason for the enhancement is not known .
( However , given that the combined A/B mutant protein [ lane 5 ] showed a residual level of ternary complex formation , one likely scenario [ also offered in the legend to Fig .
2C ] is that the domain B mutation results in a conformational change that can increase the POU-OCA-B interaction even in the absence of domain A .
Such a conformational change may also contribute , along with the loss of acidic residues per se , to the coactivation defect of the B mutant protein . )
Nevertheless , given that the B mutant protein maintains the ability to supershift an octamer-POU-1 complex , its coactivation defect most likely originates from lack of a downstream interaction ( s ) .
By virtue of a lack of both interactions , it is reasonable that the A/B double mutant protein shows an even more reduced coactivation capacity ( Fig .
2A and B ) .
To further establish these ideas , dominant negative potentials of wild-type versus mutant OCA-B proteins were tested .
Namalwa cell ( Nam ; a B-cell lymphoma line ) nuclear extract was supplemented with recombinant proteins at a 6:1 molar ratio of exogenous to endogenous OCA-B , and the IgH promoter activity was determined in an in vitro transcription assay ( Fig .
2D ) .
As predicted , the B mutant protein showed a significant dominant negative effect ( compare lane 3 to lane 1 ) , in agreement with the idea that it can bind strongly to the IgH promoter-Oct-1 complex and interfere , competitively , with the binding of endogenous OCA-B .
In contrast , the A and A/B mutant proteins had no ( or marginal ) effects ( compare lanes 4 and 5 to lane 1 ) , whereas exogenously added wild-type OCA-B slightly boosted IgH promoter activity ( compare lane 2 to lane 1 ) .
The inability of the A mutant protein , which maintains the normal domain B ( Fig .
1A ) , to exert a dominant negative effect suggests that OCA-B may interact with a downstream target ( s ) more strongly when it is on the promoter than when it is free in solution .
Mechanism of action of OCA-B : essential role for PC4 and synergism with PC2 in a purified reconstituted system .
Because OCA-B alone can confer B-cell level activation on Ig promoters , its function has been analyzed mainly in crude HeLa nuclear extracts ( see above and references 30 and 31 ) .
However , an earlier study ( 31 ) indicated that it can also function in a system reconstituted with Oct-1 , highly purified HeLa-derived basal factors and RNA polymerase II , and general coactivator fraction USA .
This suggested that Ig promoter activation by the specialized coactivator OCA-B requires still other general ( USA-derived ) cofactors ( reviewed in reference 18 ) .
In the case of transcription activation by Gal4-based activators on model promoters with multiple Gald4 sites , the USA-derived positive cofactor PC4 can replace , and is as potent as , the complete USA fraction ( e.g. , 11 , 22 ; reviewed in reference 18 ) .
However , our earlier study showed that PC4 alone could not substitute for USA in mediating Oct-1/0CA-B function in a reconstituted system ( 31 ) , thus raising the question of whether the Gal4-based artificial system had `` short-circuited '' a regulatory pathway normally requiring more than one component of the USA fraction .
To gain further insights into this question , the first objective was to determine whether PC4 is , indeed , essential for the ability of USA to mediate activation by Oct-1 and OCA-B .
To this end , PC4 was immunodepleted from the USA fraction ( Fig .
3A ) and the ability of the PC4-deficient USA to support OCA-B function with Oct-1 was assessed ( Fig .
3B ) .
The PC4-free USA was found to be almost completely inactive in this system ( compare lane 7 to lane 6 ) , suggesting that PC4 is , indeed , an essential USA component for Oct-1 and OCA-B Mor .

PC4 as an essential component of USA and acting synergistically with PC2 , to support the function of OCA-B in a reconstituted transcription system .
( A ) PC4 depletion ( dep . )
from the USA coactivator fraction ( left panel ) and from the nuclear extract ( NE ; right panel ; the treated nuclear extracts were used in the experiment shown in Fig .
5 ) .
The completion of the depletion was examined by immunoblotting with anti-PC4 antibodies .
( B ) IgH promoter activity was analyzed in the reconstituted system with components of general factors and RNA polymerase II ( top ) in the presence ( + ) or absence of Oct-1 , OCA-B , or the USA fraction , as indicated .
Lanes 1 to 5 demonstrate an IgH promoter dependency on activator Oct-1 , general coactivator fraction USA , and specialized coactivator OCA-B .
Oct-1 is absolutely required for the promoter activity ( compare lanes 2 and 3 to lane 4 , which represents a complete set of components sufficient to bring about a high level of IgH promoter transcription ) .
In an otherwise complete system , the transcription is stimulated ~15-fold by USA and ~8-fold by OCA-B ( compare lane 1 , missing USA , and lane 5 , missing OCA-B , respectively , to lane 4 , complete ) .
Lanes 6 to 8 demonstrate that PC4 is an essential component of USA to support the function of OCA-B in the reconstituted transcription system .
The defect of the PC4-depleted USA fraction ( lane 7 ) , compared to the complete USA fraction ( lane 6 ) , can be rescued by the addition of 50 ng of recombinant PC4 ( lane 8 ) .
( C ) PC4-PC2 synergism for the function of OCA-B in the reconstituted system .
Components ( top ) were used to transcribe the IgH promoter in the absence or presence ( + or ++ ) of a general coactivator ( s ) , as indicated .
The levels of coactivation are ( compared to lane 1 ) ~15-fold by USA ( lane 2 ) , ~1.5- to 3-fold by PC2 ( lanes 5 and 3 ) , ~3- to 5-fold by PC4 ( lanes 6 and 4 ) , and ~10- to 15-fold by PC2 plus PC4 ( lanes 8 and 7 ) .
Amounts of factors used in the reconstituted system ( for both B and C ) are as follows : TFII-A , 0.5 wl ; recombinant TFH-B , 50 ng ; TFI-D , 2 wl ; TFII-E/F/H fraction , 3.5 pl ; RNA polymerase II , 0.25 wl ; Oct-1 ( when added ) , 20 ng ; recombinant OCA-B , 50 ng ; recombinant PC4 , 25 ( + ) and 50 ( ++ ) ng ; USA , mock-depleted USA and PC4-depleted USA , 1 pl of each ; PC2 , 1 ( + ) and 2 ( ++ ) pl .
function in the reconstituted system .
The transcription level was almost fully restored by addition of recombinant PC4 protein ( lane 8 ) .
Given that PC4 alone could not replace the USA fraction to support Oct-1 and OCA-B function ( 31 ) , we conclude that it must act synergistically with another component ( s ) in the USA fraction .
To identify the component ( s ) that acts in conjunction with Vou .
18 , 1998 PCA , native and PC4-depleted USA fractions were further fractionated .
An activity chromatographically identical to PC2 ( 24 ) was found to be jointly required with the recombinant PC4 to fully support the Oct-1- and OCA-B-dependent activation of the IgH promoter ( Fig .
3C , lanes 7 and 8 ) , whereas a fraction containing PC1 and PC3 , in addition to PC4 , was inactive ( data not shown ) .
As can be seen , appropriate titration of both PC4 and PC2 produced a transcription level equivalent to that obtained with the intact USA fraction ( compare lane 7 to lane 2 ) .
On the other hand , and in agreement with prior studies of PC4 ( 31 ) , the IgH promoter activity was compromised in the transcription system containing either PC4 or PC2 alone ( compare lanes 3 to 6 to lanes 2 , 7 , and 8 ) .
Increasing the level of PC2 did not boost the transcription and , in agreement with the results of earlier studies ( 11 , 22 ) , increasing the level of PC4 eventually repressed the transcription system ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these results document a synergism between PC4 and PC2 that is critical for optimal Oct-1 and OCA-B function in the reconstituted system .
Note that the present analysis , in contrast to that in our previous study describing the cloning of OCA-B ( 31 ) , used increased amounts of promoter template DNA , as well as larger amounts of various transcription factors , to maximize the promoter activity such that , while maintaining 8- to 10-fold coactivation by OCA-B , the level of IgH transcription in the reconstituted system is more comparable to that observed in a crude system .
The considerable activation by PC4 alone observed here ( Fig .
3C , compare lanes 4 and 6 to lane 1 ) contrasts with the previous report showing almost no activation by PC4 ( Fig .
8 in reference 31 ) but may reflect either genuine coactivation by PC4 intrinsic to this particular redefined system or , given the observed PCZ-PCA synergism , minor PC2 contamination in the partially purified TFIID and the TFIIE/F/H fractions that were added at higher levels to accommodate a higher template dose .
Because PC2 is still poorly defined , we can not distinguish these two possibilities .
Nonetheless , the PC4-PC2 synergism was clearly evident in this experiment .
Identification of PC4 as a downstream target for OCA-B function .
As mentioned earlier , the defect of the B mutant form of OCA-B is due to loss of a downstream interaction .
This prompted us to search for an OCA-B downstream tar-get ( s ) .
PC4 seemed a likely target in view of its essential role in the function of OCA-B in a reconstituted system ( see above ) .
To investigate this possibility , GST fusion proteins containing residues 171 to 256 of either wild-type OCA-B or the B mutant protein were employed in pull-down assays to search for a nuclear extract factor ( s ) capable of interacting with the OCA-B activation domain .
As shown in the immunoblot analysis of Fig .
4 , the functional ( nonphosphorylated ) form of PC4 bound to a wild-type OCA-B-GST fusion protein but not to the mutant B-GST fusion protein ( or GST alone ) ( compare lanes 4 and 5 to lanes 2 and 3 ) .
This result is consistent with a direct role for PC4 in mediating OCA-B function through the OCA-B activation domain .
Purified recombinant PC4 bound to OCA-B in the same fashion ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the OCA-B-PC4 interaction is direct .
A redundant activity for PC4 function in a crude system .
Given that OCA-B can function in crude HeLa nuclear extracts to activate the Ig promoters , it was of interest to explore a possible role of PC4 in the coactivation pathway in the crude transcription system on the grounds that it may contain a more complete complement of nuclear factors .
To this end , the PC4 protein was quantitatively removed by immunodepletion from a HeLa nuclear extract ( Fig .
3A , right panel ) and the PC4-depleted extract was analyzed for the ability to transcribe the Oct-1/O0CA-B-dependent IgH promoter and a control Sp1- B-CELL-SPECIFIC COACTIVATOR OCA-B _ 3807 I ) \\\ A A ( 23 2 ) \o ) & ) !

Surprisingly , the PC4-deficient nuclear extract ( lanes 7 to 10 ) was as potent as the mock-depleted nuclear extract ( lanes 3 to 6 ) in transcribing both templates and OCA-B functioned equally well in PC4* and PCA_ extracts to stimulate the IgH promoter ( compare lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 9 and 10 ) to a level similar to that observed in a B-cell extract ( lane 2 ) .
These results suggest the presence of a redundant activity capable of compensating for the loss of PCA in the crude nuclear extract .

Untreated HeLa ( lane 1 ) , Namalwa ( B cell ; lane 2 ) , mock-depleted HeLa ( lanes 3 to 6 ) , and PC4-depleted HeLa nuclear extracts were used to transcribe the promoters in the absence or the presence ( + ) of PC4 ( 50 ng ) and/or OCA-B ( 20 ng ) , as indicated .
While the transcription level of the control template ( 2XSp1 ) is constant in all lanes , the IgH promoter responds to OCA-B in either mock-depleted ( lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 4 ) or PC4-depleted ( lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 7 and 8 ) HeLa nuclear extracts to a level similar to that observed in the B-cell extract ( compare lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 9 and 10 to lane 2 ) .

making PC4 an essential component for the function of Oct-1/0CA-B in the reconstituted system .
DISCUSSION In the present study , targeted mutagenesis , in conjunction with in vitro and in vivo assays , has been used to define domains of the B-cell-specific coactivator OCA-B that are critical for its proper function with the DNA binding activator Oct-1 .
Further investigations aimed at gaining more insights into the mechanism of action of OCA-B revealed a synergism between general coactivators PC2 and PC4 in mediating the activation or coactivation by Oct-1/0CA-B and an OCA-B-PC4 interaction that is of apparent functional relevance .
Finally , studies with less purified systems revealed a functional redundancy in general coactivators .
Taken together , these studies lead to a refined model of Oct-1/0CA-B function that appears to parallel that of some viral coactivators .
OCA-B domains for recruitment to the promoter .
An N-terminal OCA-B domain that shares weak similarity with an E1A region was implicated in Ig promoter targeting through interaction with the Oct-1 POU domain .
However , it appears that OCA-B contacts surfaces of both the POU-specific and POU-homeo subdomains of Oct-1 ( 2 , 28 ) , as well as nucleotides in the octamer element ( 2 , 4 ) , suggesting that several determinants in OCA-B may act in concert to form a stable DNA-activator-coactivator ternary complex .
Supporting this notion is the observation that several OCA-B residues in a region about 20 aa C terminal to domain A ( Fig .
1 ) were shown to be critical for ternary complex formation ( 14 ) .
Because the Oct-1 POU -specific and POU-homeo subdomains contact opposite sides of the DNA double helix ( 20 ) , the octamer-POU-1-OCA-B ternary complex may form a highly stable ringlike structure important for high level , long-term Ig promoter-en-hancer function in activated B cells .
An OCA-B domain involved in promoter activation and general coactivator requirements for its function .
The acidic OCA-B region ( domain B in Fig .
1 ) was shown to be critical for coactivator function ( Fig .
2A and B ) but not for binding to Oct-1 or an Oct-1-DNA complex ( Fig .
2C ) .
Further confirming this notion is the fact that while a Gal4 ( 1-94 ) -OCA-B fusion protein functions as an activator on promoters containing Gal4 binding sites ( 13 , 53 ) , a mutant with a deletion encompassing domain B loses the activation capability ( 53 ) .
Protein-protein interaction assays also suggest that domain B of OCA-B provides a determinant for the interaction with the general coactivator PC4 ( Fig .
4 ) .
Given its ability to interact with wild-type OCA-B but not the mutant B version , PC4 appears to be a genuine downstream target for the function of OCA-B .
This is in accordance with the essential role for PC4 , and its synergism with general coactivator PC2 , in supporting the optimal function of Oct-1/OCA-B in a reconstituted system .
Since PC4 alone is as potent as the USA fraction in mediating the function of Gal4-based artificial activators on synthetic templates with multiple Gal4-binding sites in the same reconstituted system ( e.g. , reference 11 ) , the PCA-PC2 synergism that was observed for the function of Oct-1/0CA¥-B may reflect the use of coactivators in the more physiological context of a natural activator and promoter .
It is relevant to note that USA was originally identified as a crude coactivator fraction capable of mediating high levels of activation by natural activators Sp1 , USF ( 34 ) , and NFB ( 23 ) , and , at least for Spl-dependent activation , USA-derived fractions were not as active as partially purified USA ( 34 ) .
A separate study ( 9 ) also has shown synergism between PC4 and PC2 in mediating ac Mor .

A model for Oct-1/OCA-B function .
On the basis of both earlier work and the new findings shown here , we present a refined model for the function of Oct-1/OCA-B ( Fig .
6 ) .
OCA-B is recruited to the target Ig promoter through primary interaction with the Oct-1 POU domain , which may precede Oct-1-DNA interactions ( 30 , 31 ) , and through secondary interactions with DNA ( 2 , 4 ) .
In conjunction with Oct-1 , OCA-B then provides an activation function .
Given the documented physical and functional interaction between OCA-B and PC4 , the OCA-B activation domain may function by influencing the basal transcription machinery with PC4 as an adapter ( 11 ) .
It is important to note that the defined activation domain ( s ) ( ACT ; 12 , 37 , 55 ) in the Oct factors also plays a key role in promoter activation because its removal , while not abrogating the OCA-B recruitment , is detrimental for OCA-B coactivation ( 31 ) , suggesting a synergism between the activation domain in OCA-B and that in Oct-1 and -2 .
This synergism parallels the synergism between PC4 and PCZ2 that is required for the proper function of Oct-1/O0CA-B in the reconstituted system , raising the intriguing possibility of a functional ( or physical ) interaction of PCZ and the Oct activation domain ( s ) .
Since PC2 is a potent but less well-characterized activity among the USA-derived coactivators ( reviewed in reference 18 ) , its synergism with PC4 in mediating the function of OCA-B/Oct-1 may provide a useful assay for its further characterization .
A redundant activity ( X in Fig .
6 ) is also implied by the PC4 depletion analysis in crude extracts ( see below ) .
The model also indicates the basis for the loss of function of the OCA-B A ( deficiency in interaction with Oct-1 and -2 ) and B ( deficiency in interaction with PC4 , and potentially the redundant activity [ X ] , that also leads to a dominant negative phenotype ) mutant proteins .
Functional analogy of OCA-B to viral coactivators .
By several criteria , OCA-B is a cellular counterpart of at least two viral coactivators , namely , the adenovirus E1A and HSV VP16 proteins .
E1A is a promiscuous coactivator capable of interacting with a number of cellular DNA binding activators that include USF , Sp1 , the ATF family , c-Jun ( 29 ) , and Oct-4 ( 49 ) via their diverse DNA binding motifs and thus possesses the potential to regulate the transcription of multiple genes lacking a common promoter element .
Of interest in relation to OCA-B is the observation that an E1A region ( residues 179 to 193 in 138 E1A ) implicated in promoter targeting ( 29 ) overlaps the E1A region ( residues 180 to 203 ) that shares weak sequence similarity with OCA-B domain A ( Fig .
1 ) , which is implicated in Ig promoter targeting through interaction with the Oct-1 POU domain ( Fig .
2C ) .
Vou .
18 , 1998 Weak ( and short ) sequence similarity notwithstanding , the functional analogy between OCA-B and E1A is probably best exemplified by the activation of reporter genes with an octamer-containing enhancer in embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cells ( 49 ) .
First , in differentiated EC cells , the reporter genes can be stimulated by Oct-4 ( also named Oct-3 ) and 138 E1A in a synergistic fashion ; second , as is the case for Oct-1/0O0CA-B function ; activation domains from both the activator ( Oct-4 ) and the coactivator ( ElA ) are jointly required for optimal enhancer function ; third , Oct-4 , E1A , and octamer DNA form a ternary complex , as revealed by gel shift analysis ; finally , in undifferentiated EC stem cells , a high level of activation can be achieved by endogenous Oct-4 alone .
Given all of these par-allels , it is reasonable to postulate that Oct-4 functions in undifferentiated EC stem cells with an E1A functional ho-molog that may be a member of a cellular coactivator family represented by OCA-B .
OCA-B also shows a remarkably close resemblance to the viral coactivator VP16 with respect to both interactions and mechanism of activation .
VP16 activates HSV immediate-early genes by engaging in the formation of a multiprotein-promoter complex in conjunction with Oct-1 and another host cell factor ( reviewed in references 5 and 15 ) .
Like OCA-B , VP16 interacts with promoter-bound Oct-1 through the POU domain ( e.g. , references 26 and 43 ) and has both a DNA binding activity contingent on Oct-1 binding to DNA ( 25 , 52 ; reviewed in references 5 and 15 ) and an acidic activation domain that has the potential to interact with the general cofactor PC4 ( 11 ) .
The observation that , in both cases , mutations in the activation domains either severely weaken or abolish the ability to interact with PC4 ( 11 and this work ) further supports the functional relevance of a PC4-activation domain interaction .
The function and direct interaction of PC4 with several defined acidic activation domains , including those of AH , IE , E1A , VP16 ( 11 ) , and OCA-B ( this work ) strongly argue for the role of PC4 as an adapter that bridges promoter-bound transcription factors and cofactors to the basal transcriptional machinery by interacting with TFIIA ( 11 ) and/or RNA polymerase II ( 33 ) .
Finally , given the recent identification of a specialized Oct-1 cofactor activity involved in the S-phase activation of an octamer-dependent H2B promoter ( 32 ) , it is probable that at least some cellular genes are controlled by gene-specific coactivators that function analogously to viral coactivators and are represented by OCA-B .
Redundancy in general coactivator function .
In sharp contrast to the observation that PC4 is essential for the Oct-1/ OCA-B function in a reconstituted system , PC4 is dispensable for the function of Oct-1/0OCA-B in a crude ( nuclear extract ) system ( Fig .
5 ) .
This suggests the existence of a redundant activity that is missing in the purified components used in the reconstituted assay system .
This redundant activity ( X in Fig .
6 ) may serve as an alternative adapter capable of mediating the OCA-B-general transcription factor interaction , thus bypassing the requirement for PC4 in a crude transcription system .
Indeed , a potential candidate for such an activity has been detected by purification methods ( 60 ) .
Functional redundancy could be a hallmark of regulatory pathways in transcription .
Thus , despite an absolute requirement of TATA box binding protein-associated factor ( TAFS ) for activator function in purified reconstituted systems ( reviewed in , e.g. , reference 57 ) , studies with yeast ( conditional knockout ; 1 , 36 , 59 ) and less-purified human cell-free systems ( 40 ) challenge the view of a universal role of TAFs in promoter activation and imply the existence of a distinct class of functionally redundant activities ( e.g. , those present in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme [ reviewed in references 3 , 21 , and 38 ] ) that may act through B-CELL-SPECIFIC COACTIVATOR OCA-B _ 3809 distinct mechanisms .
As is the case for the function of OCA-B , this implies alternative pathways for communication between activators and/or coactivators and the basal transcription machinery .
