S. ] ABSTRACT Antisera raised against human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors were used in combination with the glucocorticoid receptor affinity label [ °H ] dexamethasone 21-mesylate ( [ °HJDM ) to identify the glucocorticoid receptors of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 and the human T-cell leukemic cell line CEM-C7 .
Antisera were obtained following immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with [ °HJtriamcinolone acetonide ( [ °H ] JTA ) -gluco-corticoid receptor complexes partially purified by two-stage DNA-cellulose chromatography .
The presence of anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies was verified by : ( a ) adsorption of [ °H ] TA-receptor-antibody complexes to Protein A ; ( b ) a shift to higher apparent molecular weight in the elution position from Sephacryl $ 300 of [ °H ] JTA-receptor complexes incubated with immune serum ; and ( c ) the ability of immune serum to displace [ PH ] JTA-receptor complexes on sucrose gradients .
These antibodies also recognized rat liver and murine $ 49 cell glucocorticoid receptors .
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ °HJDM-labeled IM-9 cytosol identified a major competable band with a molecular weight of ~90,000 , three minor competable components with molecular weights of ~78,000 , ~51,000 , and ~38,500 , and at least 21 other noncom-petable components .
Following immunoprecipitation of [ °HJDM-labeled cytosol with immune serum , only the M , 90,000 and 78,000 components were seen .
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ °HJDM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol revealed a larger number of [ °HJDM-labeled components .
However , after immunoprecipitation of [ °HJDM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol , a predominant competable component with a molecular weight of 90,000 was easily identified .
This component was markedly diminished when cytosols from the glucocorticoid receptor-deficient cell line ICR-27 were used .
Thus , the combination of affinity labeling and anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies is capable of providing direct physical identification of human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors .

While several studies have suggested that a positive correlation exists between glucocorticoid receptor concentration and clinical response , it is clear that many patients with high levels of glucocorticoid receptor binding activity fail to respond to therapy ( 1 , 19 , 21 , 24 ) .
in theory , this could result from the fact that glucocorticoid receptor binding activity is a necessary but insufficient marker for glucocorticoid response .
Indeed , we have described previously mutants derived from the glucocorticoid-sensitive human leukemic cell line CEM-C7 which exhibit considerable amounts of glucocorticoid receptor binding activity but which are completely unresponsive to glucocorticoids ( 15 , 16 ) .
Detailed biochemical analyses of these mutants revealed subtle defects in their glucocorticoid receptors , principally in their ability to form and maintain the activated state of the SR* complex essential for biological response ( 15 , 33 ) .
While detailed biochemical analysis of receptors is possible on a small number of samples of sufficient size , such analyses are extremely difficult to perform on a large number of samples .
Recently , a number of laboratories have succeeded in the preparation of antisera or monoclonal antibodies against several steroid hormone receptors , including human estrophilin and the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor ( 6 , 10-14 , 22 , 27 , 30 , 31 , 43 ) .
These reagents provide powerful new tools for the analysis of steroid hormone receptors .
However , the requirement for retention of a reversibly bound radioactive ligand and the weak cross-reactivity between anti-rat liver glucocorticoid receptor antibodies and human glucocorticoid receptors ( Footnote 5 ; Ref .
40 ) have limited the use of anti-rat liver glucocorticoid receptor antibodies for the study of human glucocorticoid receptors .
We have described previously ( 8 , 39 ) the properties of an electrophilic affinity ligand for the glucocorticoid receptor , [ °H ] -DM , which forms a covalent complex with the glucocorticoid receptor .
Although this reagent is not entirely specific for the glucocorticoid receptor , it has been used in conjunction with anti-rat liver glucocorticoid receptor antibodies to identify a single M. 90,000 component from partially purified rat liver cytosolic proteins , which appears to be the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor ( 8 , 38 ) .
Thus , this reagent eliminates the requirement for retention * The abbreviations used are : SR , steroid-receptor ; DM , dexamethasone 21-mesylate ; TA , triamcinolone acetonide ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate ; PAGE , poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis ; HTC , hepatoma tissue culture ; HENDG , 10 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethy ( ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-1 mm EDTA-100 mm NaCt+-O0.5 mm dithiothreitol-10 % glycerol ( pH 7.6 ) .

of a reversibly bound ligand in order to identity the glucocorticoid receptor .
To study human glucocorticoid receptors , we have now prepared antisera against highly purified preparations of human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors .
We report here the preparation of these antisera and their properties .
Using [ °HJDM , 4 steroid-specific binding components ( M , =90,000 , 78,000 , 51,000 , and 38,500 ) were identified in crude cytosol prepared from IM-9 lymphoblastoid cells .
Only the 2 largest of these components reacted with anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibody .
Similar analysis of cytosol prepared from the human T-cell line CEM-C7 also identified a protein of M , 290,000 .
The concentration of this protein was markedly reduced in mutants containing diminished quantities of glucocorticoid receptor binding activity .
These results suggest that we have prepared antisera specific for the glucocorticoid receptor and that the reduced denatured steroid binding component of the human glucocorticoid receptor is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 90,000 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and Cell Culture .
IM-9 cells obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Jesse Roth ( Diabetes Branch , National Institute of Arthritis , Diabetes , and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , NIH , Bethesda , MD ) were grown in RPMI 1640 ( Biofluids , Rockville , MD ) in the presence of 5 % fetal bovine serum ( KC Biologicals , St. Louis , MO ) .
The glucocorticoid-sensitive human leukemic cell line , CEM-C7 , and the receptor-deficient mutant , ICR-27 ( 16 ) , were grown in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 10 % fetal bovine serum .
The murine cell line $ 49 was obtained from Dr. Gordon Hager ( Laboratory of Tumor Virus Genetics , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD ) and grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium in the presence of 10 % fetal bovine serum .
All cell lines were grown as stationary suspensions in a humidified atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % CO ; .
Cells were maintained at a density of 10° to 2 x 10° cells/ mi .
Preparation of Cytosol .
For most experiments , cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 800 x g ) and washed twice in Hanks ' balanced salts solution .
Unless otherwise indicated , all further work was performed at 0-4° .
The final cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of homogenization buffer [ 10 mm 4- { 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethane-sulfonic acid-1 mm EDTA-10 mm NaCL-O0.5 mm dithiothreitol , pH 7.6 ) and immediately homogenized with 15 strokes of a Ten Broeck ground glass homogenizer .
Following centrifugation at 150,000 x g for 90 min at O-2° , the supernatant was immediately adjusted to contain 10 % glycerol and 0.1 m NaCI .
Cytosols prepared in this manner were either used immediately or quick frozen in liquid N ; and stored in liquid N ; .
Frozen cytosols contained 100 % of receptor binding activity for up to 3 months with no evidence of further receptor degradation or proteolysis .
Purification of Glucocorticoid Receptor .
For each experiment , cytosol was prepared from 2 x 10 '' IM-9 cells as described above .
Cytosol was labeled for 2 hr in the presence of 100 nm [ °H ] JTA ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL 20 Ci/mmof ) , and [ °HJTA-receptor complexes were purified with minor modifications by the 2-stage DNA-cellulose chromat-ographic procedure of Eisen and Glinsmann ( 7 ) .
All chromatography was performed in HENDG buffer .
The second DNA-cellulose column was eluted with HENDG buffer containing 10 mm pyridoxal phosphate .
Purified receptor was concentrated by adsorption to hydroxylapatite and eluted with 0.4 m phosphate buffer , pH 7.2. immunization of Rabbits .
Female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized at 4-week intervals with 50 to 80 pmol of purified receptor at multiple dorsal intradermal sites .
The first 2 immunizations of each rabbit were performed in complete Freund 's adjuvant ( Grand Island Biological Co. , Grand Island , NY ) .
Subsequent immunizations were performed in OCTOBER 1984 Anti-Human Glucocorticoid Receptor Antibodies incomplete adjuvant .
Ten days after each immunization , serum was collected and assayed for antibody activity .
Determination of antibody activity was performed by incubating crude [ °H ] JTA-labeled cytosols with various dilutions of serum , followed by adsorption of [ °HJTA-receptor-antibody complexes to formalin fixed Staphylococcus aureus membranes ( 18 ) .
Conjugates were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 x g and washed twice in HENDG buffer containing 20 mm sodium molybdate .
The final pellets were resuspended in 1.0 ml of HENDG buffer and counted by liquid scintillation methods using a Beckman LS-7800 liquid scintillation spectrometer programmed for dpm conversion .
Gel Filtration .
[ °H ] TA-labeled samples ( 0.3 mi ) were applied to a 1- x 40-cm ( 38 mi ) column of Sephacryl $ 300 ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piscataway , NJ ) equilibrated with HENDG buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl .
Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 11 mi/hr , and 1.0-ml fractions were collected and assayed for radioactivity .
The apparent Stokes ' radius of eluted SR complexes was computed from standard curves of ( -log K , , ) * versus Stokes ' radii obtained for the protein standards thyroglobulin ( R , = 8.5 nm ) , ferritin ( R , = 6.1 nm ) , catalase ( R , = 5.2 nm ) , aldolase ( A , = 4.8 nm ) , bovine serum albumin ( A , = 3.6 nm ) , and ovalbumin ( R , = 3.1 nm ) ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Samples routinely contained '*C-bovine serum albumin as an internal standard .
Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation .
Samples ( 200 L1 ) were layered onto 4.8-ml 5 to 20 % linear sucrose gradients in buffer ( 10 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethy !
) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-1 mm EDTA-0.5 mm dithiothreitol , pH 7.6 ) containing 0.5 m NaCI .
Gradients were subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 200,000 x g for 18 hr at 4° and then fractionated into 0.2-ml fractions using a Buchler Auto Densi-Flow IIC gradient fractionater .
All gradients contained ' '' C-bovine serum albumin as an internal standard .
Approximate sedimentation coefficients were determined as described by Martin and Ames ( 23 ) .
Affinity Labeling of Glucocorticoid Receptor .
Crude cytosol ( 50 ul ) prepared without dithiothreitol was incubated in the presence of 200 nm HJDM ( 37 ) for 4 hr at 0-4° .
Samples were either diluted with an equal volume of sample buffer ( 0.125 m Tris-HCH-4 % SDS-20 % glycerol-10 % B-mercaptoethanol , pH 6.8 ) or incubated with 10 L1 of immune or nonimmune serum for 4 hr at 0-4° .
Samples incubated with antibody were adsorbed to Sepharose CL-4B-immobilized Protein A ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals ) for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 1 min .
The resulting pellets were washed 3 times with 1.0 ml of HENDG buffer , followed by elution of [ °HJDM receptor complexes with electrophoresis sample buffer ( 20 ) .
SDS-PAGE .
SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmii ( 20 ) .
Following electrophoresis , gels were fixed in 10 % acetic acid and then impregnated with EN°HANCE ( New England Nuclear , Boston , MA } .
Impregnated gels were dried , and the radioactivity was visualized by fluorography at -70° using Kodak XAR-5 film ( Eastman Kodak , Roch-ester , NY ) .
Molecular weights were determined from standard curves constructed from the mobilities of the ' '' C-labeled proteins myosin ( M , = 200,000 ) , phosphorylase b ( M , = 97,000 ) , bovine serum albumin ( M , = 69,000 ) , ovalbumin ( M , = 46,000 ) , and carbonic anhydrase ( M , = 30,000 ) ( New England Nuclear ) .
RESULTS Preparation of Anti-Human Glucocorticoid Receptor Anti-sera .
The lymphoid cell line IM-9 was chosen as a source of human glucocorticoid receptor because of its unusually high glucocorticoid receptor concentration ( 44 ) and its lack of receptors for other steroid hormones ( 32 ) .
Purification of the receptor by the 2-stage DNA-cellulose chromotography procedure of Eisen and Glinsmann ( 7 ) yielded preparations containing 50 to 100 pmol of receptor which were calculated to be approximately 50 % pure ( Table 1 ) .

a major peak of apparent Stokes ' radius 5.6 to 6.0 nm was observed ( Chart 1 ) .
This was indistinguishable from the apparent Stokes ' radius of [ °HJTA-labeled receptors in crude cytosol ( Chart 1 ) and is virtually identical to the apparent Stokes ' radius of highly purified , intact , rat liver glucocorticoid receptors ( 45 ) .
Thus , these preparations contained primarily intact , unproteo-lyzed , glucocorticoid receptors .
However , a smaller peak of =4.0 nm was also observed ( Chart 1 ) , indicating that some partially proteolyzed receptor was also present in our purified prepara-tions .
Despite the presence of a small amount of partially proteolyzed receptor and the lack of homogeneous antigen , these preparations were used to immunize female New Zealand White rabbits .
Rabbits were immunized at 3- to 4-week intervals , and the presence of anti-receptor antibody was evaluated 10 days after each immunization by indirect precipitation of receptor-antibody complexes with formalin-fixed S. aureus membranes containing Protein A .
In each of the rabbits studied , no anti-receptor antibody activity was detected in either preimmune serum or serum taken after the primary immunization ( Chart 2 ) .
In all cases , activity was detected after the second immunization , and a further increase in activity was observed after the third immunization ( Chart 2 ) .
However , additional increases in activity could not be achieved with additional immunization ( data not shown ) .
Precipitated radioactivity clearly represents [ °H ] JTA specifically bound to receptor , since incubation of receptor in the presence of 10 um unlabeled TA prior to incubation with antibody resulted in compiete loss of radioactivity in the final pellet ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , the ability of Protein A to adsorb the steroid-receptor-antibody complex suggests that the immunoreactive Table 1 Purification of IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors Receptor - Yield _ Protein Purifica- Purity Step ( pmon® __ ( % ) ___ ( mg ) '' ___ tion ( fold ) __ ( % ) ° Crude cytosol 314 100 82 1 0.034 DNA-Cellulose I flow 153 49 70 0.57 0.020 through DNA-Celtuiose II eluate 88 28 0.015 1523 53 Hydroxylapatite eluate 73 23 0.013 _ 1457 51 Z Calculated assuming one steroid binding site per receptor .

component is an IgG .
To assess whether there was a direct interaction between antibody and receptor , [ °HJTA-labeled SR complexes incubated with either immune or nonimmune serum were subjected to chromatography on Sephacryl S300 .
Complexes incubated with nonimmune serum eluted with an apparent Stokes- radius of 5.6 to 6.0 nm ( Chart 3 ) .
This is indistinguishable from the apparent Stokes ' radius of the crude or highly purified glucocorticoid receptor chromatographed under identical conditions ( Chart 1 ) .
In contrast , the elution profile of SR complexes incubated with immune serum was markedly altered ; the bulk of the SR complexes eluted in the void volume ( Chart 3 ) , indicating the presence of antibody-SR complexes .
In addition , immune serum was capable of displacing [ °H ] JTA-receptor complexes from their normal position on high-salt sucrose gradients .
When [ °H ] JTA-receptor complexes were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the absence of immune serum , a 3.8S peak of radioactivity was observed ( Chart 4 ) .
However , when [ °HJTA-receptor complexes were incubated with immune serum prior to centrifugation , the resulting complexes sedimented to the bottom of the centrifuge tube ( Chart 4 ) .
These results suggest that not only is there a direct physical interaction between the receptor and the antibody , but that there are multiple interactions .
Such interactions could be between a single species of antibody and multiple identical ( or very similar ) antigenic sites on the receptor , or they could be between multiple species of antibodies and different antigenic determinants on the receptor .

other species was determined by Sephacryl S300 chromatography of [ °H ] JTA-receptor complexes prepared from rat liver or mouse S49 cells .
As was the case for IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors , [ °H ] TA-receptor complexes prepared from either rat liver or $ 49 cytosol were found to elute as a predominantly 5.6- to 6.0-nm species after incubation with nonimmune serum ( Chart 5 ) .
In contrast , after incubation with immune sera , the [ °HJTA-receptor complexes of both species were eluted in the void volume of the column .

receptors .
However , after incubation with immune serum , there was a portion of IM-9 and rat liver [ °H ] TA complexes which were not shifted into the void volume ( Chart 5 ) .
These complexes eluted at = 4.0 nm and probably represent partially proteolyzed receptor .
Thus , it appears that anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies do not recognize partially proteolyzed receptor .
These results also suggest that it was the 5.6- to 6.0-nm form of the receptor against which antibodies were raised .
To further investigate the nature of the interaction between these antisera and the human glucocorticoid receptor , experiments were performed on cytosols labeled with [ °HJDM .
We have shown previously that this electrophilic affinity label forms a covalent attachment to rat liver and HTC cell glucocorticoid receptors ( 8 , 38 , 39 ) , presumably through the formation of a thioether linkage with a sulfhydryl group at or near the steroid binding site ( 37 , 39 ) .
When crude , unfractionated cytosol was incubated with 200 nm [ °HJDM and then subjected to SDS-PAGE , the results presented in Fig .
1 were obtained .
Although at least 25 distinct components could be resolved , the major [ PHJDM-labeled component had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 90,000 .
This is nearly identical to the molecular weights determined previously by SDS-PAGE for the activated or affinity-labeled rat liver , HTC cell , and mouse lymphoma glucocorticoid receptors ( 11 , 26 , 38 , 45 ) .
inclusion of 10 um labeled TA during the incubation to compete for specific [ °HJDM binding to receptor completely abolished the labeling of the M , 90,000 component , strongly suggesting that this component is indeed the reduced , denatured , steroid binding component of the human glucocorticoid receptor .
In addition to the elimination 4543 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

J. M. Harmon et al .
of the major M , 90,000 component , 3 other less intensely [ °H } -DM-labeled bands were also eliminated by the inclusion of unlabeled TA during the labeling reaction .
These components had molecular weights of approximately 78,000 , 51,000 , and 38,500 ( Fig .
1 ) .
Based on the known susceptibility of glucocorticoid receptors to proteolysis ( 4 , 5 , 35 , 36 , 41 , 42 ) , it is possible that these minor competable components represent small amounts of proteolyzed receptor .
After immunoprecipitation of [ °H ] JDM-labeled cytosols with immune serum , only 2 components could be identified by SDS-PAGE ( Fig .
18 ) .
The major component was the M , 90,000 protein already identified as the major [ °HJDM-labeled band in crude cytosol .
The second minor component had a molecular weight of 78,000 and most probably represents the largest of the 3 minor competable [ °HJDM-labeled bands .
In contrast , neither the M , 51,000 nor the M , 38,500 component was detectable after precipitation of [ °HJDM-labeled cytosol with immune serum .
Even after film exposures of up to 3 months , there was no evidence that these components were recognized by immune serum .
No [ °HJDM-labeled proteins were detectable after SDS-PAGE of [ PH ] JDM-labeled cytosols immunoprecipitated with either preimmune or nonimmune sera .
In addition , serum obtained from mock-immunized animals was incapable of precipitating any [ °HJDM-labeled material ( Fig .
1 ) .
Thus , the combination of affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation appears to resolve a major component with a molecular weight of ~90,000 which almost certainly represents the reduced denatured form of the IM-9 glucocorticoid receptor .
Identification of Human Leukemic Glucocorticoid Receptors .
Having established that antibodies prepared against IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors could be used in conjunction with affinity labeling to specifically identify IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors , the glucocorticoid receptors of the human leukemic cell line CEM-C7 were subjected to similar analysis .
Fig .
2 shows the results of SDS-PAGE of affinity-labeled cytosols prepared from CEM-C7 .
In contrast to the results obtained with IM-9 , a larger number of components appears to be labeled .
In addition , while a partially competable band with a molecular weight of ~90,000 can be seen , this band is not the dominant labeled species ( Fig .
24 ) .
These differences most probably reflect the fact that CEM-C7 has only 15 to 20 % of the receptor concentration of IM-9 .
However , after immunoprecipitation of [ °H ] JDM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol with immune serum , a major labeled component with a molecular weight of ~90,000 is clearly evident ( Fig .
2B ) .
The labeling of this component was completely blocked by the inclusion of 10 um unlabeled TA during the labeling reaction .
Moreover , no such component was visible after precipitation of [ °H ] JDM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol with nonimmune serum ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , this component almost certainly represents the glucocorticoid receptor of CEM-C7 cells .
Additional evidence that this is the case was obtained from [ °H ] JDM-labeled cytosols prepared from the glucocorticoid receptor-deficient mutant ICR-27 .
When affinity-labeled cytosols prepared from this mutant were subjected to SDS-PAGE following immunoprecipitation , the presence of the M , 90,000 copmponent was significantly reduced ( Fig .
2C ) .
From these data , we conclude that the antisera prepared against IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors are capable , when used in conjunction with affinity labeling , of providing unequivocal identification of human glucocorticoid receptors even when such receptors are present in extremely low amounts .
4544 Although immunoprecipitates of affinity-labeled CEM cell receptor contained contaminating protein species not seen with affinity-labeled IM-9 receptors , these contaminating proteins were present even when nonimmune sera were used ( Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
Thus , they appear to be the result of nonspecific trapping .
The fact that CEM cells contain only 15 to 20 % of the receptor concentration of IM-9 ( 15,000 to 20,000 versus 100,000 recep-tors/cell ) and the fact that [ °HJDM appears to label a much larger number of proteins in CEM cytosols than in IM-9 cytosols may account for the presence of these components .
The difference in the intensity of the major contaminating protein seen in comparing Fig .
2 , B and C , is most probably the result of clonal variation .
Equal amounts of CEM-C7 and ICR-27 cytosol were used for the experiments presented in Fig .
2 , B and C , and the data presented are from a single gel and a single piece of film .
Moreover , there are no obvious differences in the relative amounts of other minor contaminating proteins seen in Fig .
2 , B and C. DISCUSSION We have reported previously the ability of antibodies raised against the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor , in combination with the covalent affinity ligand [ °HJDM , to provide unequivocal identification of the glucocorticoid receptor in crude rat liver and HTC cell cytosols ( 8 , 38 ) .
Similar analysis of human glucocorticoid receptors has been hampered by the poor cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor with human glucocorticoid receptors ( Footnote 5 ; Ref .
40 ) .
We have now prepared antisera against highly purified preparations of human lymphoblast glucocorticoid receptors .
Antibodies prepared from both rabbits are IgGs as demonstrated by the ability of S. aureus Protein A to adsorb SR complexes ( 18 ) .
in addition , the nearly identical time courses of immunization for 2 rabbits suggest that the production of antibody in response to immunization is a reproducible phenomenon .
However , neither rabbit yielded a high-titer serum .
In most cases , 10 ul of undiluted serum were required for maximum precipitation of the 1 pmol of receptor contained in 50 ul of crude cytosol .
This was probably the result of the small amount ( 50 to 80 pmol ) of receptor used for each immunization .
It is also possible that the receptor is a poor antigen , since previous studies using much greater amounts of rat liver receptor gave similar low-titer sera ( 6 , 11 , 27 ) .
Nevertheless , immune IgG was capable of interacting directly with the occupied glucocorticoid receptor to produce a shift in the elution position of [ °H ] JTA-labeled receptor from a Sephacryl $ 300 column as well as displacement of [ °H ] JTA-receptor complexes on sucrose density gradients .
It is this ability to produce an alteration in the physical behavior of SR complexes which has heretofore been the principal means of demonstrating the presence of anti-SR antibodies ( 6 , 10-14 , 22 , 27 , 30 , 31 , 43 ) .
Of particular importance is the ability of anti-human receptor antibodies to selectively identify affinity-labeled glucocorticoid receptors .
Since only partially purified antigen was used in the immunization , we did not expect the resulting antibodies to react with only the glucocorticoid receptor .
indeed , in western blots of IM-9 proteins , several nonreceptor proteins are recognized by our antisera ( data not shown ) .
However , among all of the IM-9 cytosolic proteins labeled by [ °HJDM , only 2 components ( M , CANCER RESEARCH VOL .

90,000 and 78,000 ) reacted with immune serum .
Several lines of evidence indicate that the M , 90,000 component is the reduced denatured steroid binding subunit of the glucocorticoid receptor .
The M , 90,000 component identified in IM-9 cytosols was the most extensively labeled by [ °HJDM , and this labeling was completely abolished by the addition of unlabeled steroid .
This component had the same approximate molecular weight as did highly purified rat liver glucocorticoid receptor and affinity-labeled rat liver , HTC cell , and mouse lymphoma glucocorticoid receptor ( 8 , 10 , 11 , 26 , 38 , 39 , 45 ) .
Immunoprecipitation of this component was dependent on the presence of immune serum , and the labeling of the immunoprecipitated M , 90,000 component was competable .
In addition , the fact that the presence of this component was markedly diminished in cytosols prepared from the receptor-deficient mutant ICR-27 provides strong circumstantial evidence that the M , 90,000 component is indeed the reduced denatured steroid binding component human glucocorticoid receptor .
Calculation of the molecular weight of IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors from the hydrodynamic properties of [ °HJTA-labeled receptors ( Charts 1 and 4 ) suggests that the receptor monomer has a molecular weight of approximately 90,000 .
This is in excellent agreement with the results obtained from SDS-PAGE of the affinity-labeled receptor .
Thus , all of the data are consistent with the conclusion that the antibodies generated against partially purified preparations of IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors are capable of providing unequivocal identification of the human glucocorticoid receptor .
Antibodies raised against IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors also recognized CEM cell glucocorticoid receptors .
After affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation of CEM-C7 receptors , a distinct band with a molecular weight of 90,000 was easily resolved .
This was identical to the molecular weight determined for IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors and is also the same as reported recently for affinity-labeled glucocorticoid receptors in cells isolated directly from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or malignant |ymphoma ( 9 ) .
Surprisingly , when ICR-27 cytosols were affinity labeled and immunoprecipitated , a band with a molecular weight of 90,000 was easily identifiable .
By standard labeling criteria , these cells contain less than 500 receptors per cell ( 16 ) .
The fact that labeling of this band was competable and that its presence was immune serum dependent indicates that this band indeed represents receptors .
Thus , the combination of affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation using anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies provides an extremently powerful method for the analysis of small quantities of human glucocorticoid receptors .
It is interesting to note that the antisera prepared against IM-9 glucocorticoid receptors appear to weakly recognize a competable [ °HJDM-labeled component with a molecular weight of 78,000 but not 2 other smaller competable [ °HJDM-labeled components with molecular weights of 51,000 and 38,500 .
At this point , we can not determine whether these components are proteolytic fragments derived from the M , 90,000 receptor or whether they represent other proteins which display saturable binding of [ °HJDM .
However , these results are analogous to those reported for anti-rat liver glucocorticoid receptor antibodies .
Caristedt-Duke et al .
( 3 ) have reported that their antibody preparations did not recognize the steroid binding domain of the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor after partial proteolysis .
Okret et al .
( 28 ) and Stevens et al .
( 40 ) have reported that the anti-rat OCTOBER 1984 Anti-Human Glucocorticoid Receptor Antibodies liver glucocorticoid receptor did not recognize glucocorticoid receptors derived from corticosteroid-resistant P1798 cells .
These receptors are apparently smaller than the glucocorticoid receptors of corticosteroid-sensitive cells ( 39 ) , and the authors concluded that the receptors no longer contained the immunoreactive portion of the receptor .
More recently , Payvar et al .
( 29 ) reported that antibodies raised against the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor did recognize M , 78,000 protein thought to be a protec-lytic fragment of the receptor .
Since the antibodies described above were raised against DNA-cellulose-purified receptor , these results combined with the data presented here raise the possibility that glucocorticoid 'receptors purified by DNA-celluiose chromatography from either rat liver or human lymphoblasts contain a common immunogenic site .
