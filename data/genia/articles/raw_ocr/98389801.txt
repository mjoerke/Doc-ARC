Although the exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to leuke-mogenesis is still unclear , the Tax protein is thought to play a major role in this process .
This 40-kDa polypep-tide is able to interact with the tumor suppressor p16 '' ~** , Consequently , Tax can activate the signaling pathway that lead to the release of E2F that in turn induces expression of factors required for cell cycle pro-gression .
In this paper , we demonstrate that Tax can also activate E2F-mediated transcription independently of p16 '' ~** .
Indeed , when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells , which lack expression of it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites .
This stimulation is abrogated by mutations affecting the E2F-binding sites .
In addition , Tax also stimulates the transcription of the EZF-1 gene itself .
Using Tax mutants that fail to activate either ATF- or NF- « B-dependent promoters and different 5 ' truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter , we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the EZ2F1l gene involves , at least in part , the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter .

Moreover , Tax stimulates ATF/CREB binding to CREB-binding protein ( 9 ) .
Tax is highly pleiotropic , as it has been shown to transcriptionally stimulate a wide variety of cellular genes through its ability to activate other transcription factors including the p67° '' * '' , NF- « B/Rel proteins , Ets1l , NF-Y , and Spl ( 10-14 ) , and to repress gene transcription through factors of the basic helix-loop-helix family ( 15-17 ) .
It has been suggested that Tax plays a key role in the onset of ATL , but it still remains unclear which of the diverse stimulation activities of Tax is essential for immortalization of HTLV -I-infected T-lymphocytes .
In studies with Tax mutants ( 18 ) , transactivation through NF- « B was reported to be not required for rat fibroblast transformation , whereas Tax mutants unable to transactivate the ATF/CREB pathway were described to be not oncogenic ( 19 ) .
However , these results are in contrast to an observation of Yamaoka et al .
( 20 ) , suggesting that constitutive activation of NF- « B is essential for transformation of rat fibroblasts by Tax .
Nevertheless , transduction in human primary T-lymphocytes of a Tax mutant that is active for ATF/CREB but inactive for NF- « B resulted in permanent growth of the cells suggesting that Tax can induce immortalization of T-lymphocytes through a mechanism independent of NF- « B pathway ( 21 ) .
E2F cellular activity is the result of the heterodimeric association ( 22 ) of two families of proteins , E2F 's ( E2F1-5 ) ( 23-25 ) and DPs ( DP1-2 ) ( 26-28 ) .
All E2Fs share a conserved DNA-binding domain , and an acidic residue-rich region involved in transcription activation .
While bound on DNA , they exist as free heterodimers E2F/DP or associated in larger complexes containing members of the pRB tumor suppressor ( pRB , p107 , p130 ) and of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases ( cyeB/cdk2 , cyeA/cdk2 ) protein families .
E2F/DP transcription factors can act as repressors ( large complexes ) or as activators ( free het-erodimers ) of their target genes .
The pocket proteins pRB , p107 , and p130 inhibit E2F/DP transactivation and probably that of other surrounding transcription factors close to E2F 's on DNA .
E2F/DP association with the pocket proteins is con-trolled , at least in part , by the cyclin/edks ( cyeD/cdk4 , cycF/ cdk2 , cycA/cdk2 ) -dependent phosphorylation of the pocket proteins and of E2F/DP .
This control of edks on E2F activity links the cell-cycle machinery to gene-regulated expression .
All E2F/DP family members recognize a canonical sequence , 5'-T ( NNJT ( CIG ) ( C/IG ) CGC-3 ' ( 29 ) that is critical in the promoter of many genes controlling cell cycle progression , such as : ( i ) DNA and chromatin synthesis proteins : dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) , thymidine kinase , DNA polymerase a , proliferating cell nuclear antigen , histone H2A ; ( ii ) cell cycle regulatory proteins : cyclin A , cyclin E , cyclin D1 , p107 , pRB , edc6 , hsorc1 , E2F-1 , and E2F-2 ; ( iii ) cellular proto-oncogenes : including c This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Tax Transactivation of E2F-dependent Transcription myc , N-myce , erb-B and B-myb .
A detailed study of E2F protein complexes in T-cells demonstrated that the prevailing E2F complexes contain E2F-1 and E2F-4 associated with DP-1 ( 80 ) .
Given the crucial role of E2F target genes in cell proliferation , the stimulation of the E2F activity by HTLV-I could be involved in the proliferation and transformation of T-cells in ATL .
Several lines of evidence support this model .
Indeed , it has been shown that HTLV -I-infected T-cell lines and leukemic cells obtained from ATL patients contained high levels of the DNA binding activity of E2F and that Tax enhanced this E2F activity in Jurkat T-cells ( 31 ) .
As proposed recently ( 32 ) , it is believed that Tax mediates this effect via its direct interaction with the cdk inhibitor p16'~** ( 83 , 34 ) .
This interaction would lead to the following successive events ( 35 ) : ( i ) an increase in cyclin D/cdk4 kinase activity in infected cells , ( ii ) an enhanced level of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein family ( pRB , p107 , and p130 ) , and ( iii ) an increase in EZ2F transcriptional activity .
However , we demonstrate that Tax also stimulates the E2F activity via other mechanisms .
Indeed , using transient transfection analysis , we demonstrate here that Tax remains able to stimulate gene expression through E2F-1 and E2F-4 in the p16 '' ~ '' *-negative CEM T-cell line .
Furthermore , we show that the stimulation by Tax of a luciferase reporter gene driven by E2F motifs is abrogated by mutations that affect the E2F binding sites .
Finally , we demonstrate that Tax regulates E2F-1 gene expression at the level of transcription and that this transcriptional control depends , at least in part , on the ATF binding site of the E2F-1 gene promoter .
Together , these results indicate that Tax can likely disregulate the machinery controlling cell cycle progression not only by activating E2F-dependent transcription but also by stimulating the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself .
Since overexpression of E2F-1 in mammalian cells can cause oncogenesis ( 86-38 ) , the transactivation of the E2F-1 promoter by Tax could be an important step in the mechanism of HTLV-I transformation .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cells-The lymphoblastoid CEM cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Bethesda , MD ) .

RESULTS Tax Stimulates E2FI-dependent Transcription in the p16 '' negative CEM T-cell Line-To test whether Tax might activate E2F-mediated transcription independently of p16 '' ~ '' ** '' pathway , we performed transient cotransfection assays in a T-cell line defective in expression of p16 '' ~*** .
It has been described that some tumor cell lines are unable to express the p16 '' ~** '' and among them various transformed T-cell lines having homozygous deletions of the p16 ' '' ~** '' gene ( 88 ) .
In agreement with these observations , no p16'*~** '' could be detected in the CEM cell line used in our study ( data not shown ) .
At first , we tested the effects of Tax on the promoters of the DHFR and cyclin E genes , which are known to be controlled by the E2F factors ( 29 , 45 ) .
Transient cotransfection assays were carried out using luciferase expression plasmids .
The transfection assays were performed in CEM cells in the presence or absence of the Tax expression vector pSG-Tax .
Tax synthesis stimulated expression of luciferase gene driven by cyclin E ( pCyeE-lue ) and DHFR ( pDHFR-lue ) promoters with a 4- and 3.5-fold increase in luciferase activity , respectively ( Fig .
1 ) .
When the transfection assays were carried out with transcriptionally defective Tax mutants , Tax M9 ( Fig .
1 ) and Tax M21 ( data not shown ) , such stimulations were not detected .
These results indicated that Tax was able to activate the promoters of DHFR and cyclin E genes in a T-cell line .
To study possible involvement of E2F in Tax transactivation of these cellular promoters , we first tested whether Tax might cooperate with E2F in transactivation .
E2F1l and Tax were coexpressed in presence of a reporter construct driven by a minimal promoter with upstream -binding sites ( p3xE2F-WT-luc ) .
This construct contains three E2F binding sites cloned immediately upstream of a TATA box controlling the transcription of the luciferase gene .
Fig .
2 shows that this reporter was stimulated 8.5-fold in the presence of the expression vector pCMV-E2F-1 alone and 9-fold with pSG-Tax alone .
No stimulation was detected with the mutants Tax M9 ( Fig .
2 ) and Tax M21 ( data not shown ) .
This Tax stimulation was likely mediated by endogenous E2F factor .
Cotransfection of pSG-Tax and pCMV-E2F-1 induced a 44-fold increase in luciferase activity , indicating that Tax was able to stimulate E2F-1 activity in the CEM cell line .
Cotransfections with the transcriptionally defective Tax mutants produced no stimulation of E2F-1 activity .

Tax stimulation of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the DHFR or cyclin E promoters .
CEM cells ( 5 X 10° ) were transfected with 2 ug of luciferase gene driven by cyclin E promoter ( pCyeE-luc ) or by DHFR promoter ( pDHFR-luc ) + 5 ug of the Tax expression vectors ( producing either the wild type Tax or the transcriptionally defective mutant Tax M9 ) or empty pSG-5 vector .
5 ug of a -galactosidase containing plasmid ( pACB1 ) was included in each transfection for controlling of the transfection efficiency .

Luciferase activities were assayed using the Promega 's luciferase assay system and normalized for B-galactosidase activities .

Tax stimulation of gene expression mediated by E2F-1 .
Assays were performed in CEM cells using for each transient cotransfection 10 ug of pBxE2F-WT-luc bearing three copies of E2F binding site ( mentioned E2F-Box in the figure ) and 5 ug of pACB1 .
The effects of Tax and E2F-1 were analyzed by using either 0.1 ug of pCMV-E2F-1 + 0.5 ug of pDP1 ( E2F-Box + E2F-1 ) , or 5 ug Tax expression vectors ( E2F-Box + Tax or E2F-Box + Tax M9 ) , or 0.1 ug of pCMV-E2F-1 + 0.5 ug of pDP1 + 5 ug of Tax expression vectors ( EZF-Box + E2F-1 + Tax or E2F-Box + E2F-1 + Tax M9 ) , the balance of total amount of transfected DNA being made up with pSG-5 .

Comparative sensitivity of wild-type or mutant E2F binding sites to activation by E2F-1 or by E2F-1 + Tax .

mid p3xE2F-MUT-lue .
The design of this mutant , which converts the E2F binding site 5'-TTTCGCGC-3 ' to 5'-TTgCtCGa-3 ' , was based on mutations that are known to abolish binding and activity of E2F ( 44 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the mutant promoter was very poorly induced by Tax and E2F-1 compared with the wild type construct .
The efficiency of Tax-mediated induction of luciferase activity was reduced by 5.5-fold with Tax alone and 39-fold with Tax and E2F-1 compared with control promoter .
The mutant promoter still showed a slight 1.5-fold enhancement by Tax , which corroborates previous published results ( see , e.g. , Refs .
51-53 ) , and represents low level of Tax induction on a minimal TATA box .
Taken together , our results demonstrate that Tax activates E2F-1-dependent transcription .
Tax Also Stimulates Transcription through E2F4-The E2F family is composed of two subclasses of evolutionarily distinct factors : E2Fs-1 , 2 and 3 , which interact with pRB ; and E2F-4 and E2F-5 , which interact with p107 and p130 , two other members of the pRB family .
Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that E2F-4 and E2F-5 were more closely related to each other than to E2Fs 1 , 2 , and 3 .
We questioned whether transactivation by Tax of a promoter containing E2F binding sites could be activated in the presence of E2F-4 .
For this experiment , we used the same approach as described for E2F-1 , by testing the Tax transactivation on wild type and mutated E2F sites in cotransfection experiments with or without E2F-4 .
Although expression of E2F-4 in cells transfected with the vector pCSMYC-E2F-4 induced a 6-fold stimulation of the reporter gene , its coexpression with pSG-Tax gave rise to a 21-fold increase in luciferase activity ( data not shown ) .
Likewise , as showed for E2F-1 , mutation of the E2F site reduced the Tax activity on E2F-4 , confirming that stimulation by Tax was due to direct effect of the binding of E2F-4 to the E2F site ( data not shown ) .
Thus , not only does Tax activate E2F-1-dependent transcrip-tion , it is also able to stimulate the E2F-4 transcriptional activity .
Tax Stimulates E2F-1 Gene Expression-As it has been proposed that the E2F1 gene might be regulated by its own prod-uct , we tested whether Tax would also stimulate the E2F1l promoter , thereby enhancing its effect on cellular E2F activity .

Analysis of E2F-1 protein expression in human T-cell lines infected with HTLV-I .
A , for an immunoblot analysis , 20 ug protein of nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat and HSB-2 cells and from Tax-positive T-cells , MT4 and C8166 , were electrophoresed through a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblot-ting using anti-E2F-1 mAb ( top ) or anti-Tax ( bottom ) .
B , naphthol blue black-stained Western blot containing 20 ug of protein from nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat , HSB-2 , MT4 , and C8166 cells showing that the same amount of proteins was loaded into each of the lanes .
To address this question , we first checked the level of endogenous E2F-1 protein in two human T-cell lines infected with HTLV-I , MT4 , and C8166 cells .
As shown in Fig .
4 , immuno-blotting analysis using an anti-E2F-1 mAb indicated that expression of E2F-1 was increased in nuclear extracts of Tax-positive cells compared with the level seen in uninfected Jurkat and HSB-2 cells .
This result suggests that Tax expression could stimulate E2F-1 gene expression .
In order to test whether this effect was due to a direct transcriptional effect of Tax on E2F-1 gene expression , we then compared E2F-1 mRNA levels in presence or absence of Tax protein .
This experiment was carried out with the JPX-9 clone of Jurkat cells containing the Tax gene under a promoter whose expression is stimulated by heavy metal ions ( 42 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5A , the level of E2F-1 mRNA was clearly increased in JPX-9 cells treated with either ZnCl , or CdCl , , whereas the expression of control GAPDH mRNA was unchanged .
JPX/M cells that expressed nonfunctional Tax were treated in the same way but did not show any increase in the level of E2F-1 mRNA ( Fig .
5B ) .
These results indicate that stimulation of E2F-1 mRNA synthesis correlates with the presence of Tax .
We finally tested whether Tax can stimulate E2F-1 promoter activity .
Transfection assays were performed with the plasmid pGL2-AN that contains the E2F-1 promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase gene .
Cotransfection of pSG-Tax and pGL2-AN induced a 5.5-fold stimulation in luciferase activity ( Fig .
6 ) , indicating that Tax is effectively able to activate the E2F-1 promoter .
Tax Transactivation of the E2F-1 Promoter Is Dependent , at Least in Part , on the ATF Binding Site-To further explore the mechanisms underlying this transcriptional activation the same cotransfection assay was carried out in presence of Tax mutants that fail to activate ATF ( M47 ) - or NF- « B ( M22 ) -de-pendent promoters ( 18 ) .

A , PCR analysis ( top ) of retrotranscribed mRNA in JPX-9 cells cultured in medium alone ( lanes 2 and 4 ) or medium containing 120 uM ZnCl , ( Zane 3 ) or 5 uM CdCl , ( Zane 5 ) , was performed with the E2F-1 I/E2F-1 II oligonucleotide primer pair .
A control is shown ( Zane 1 ) in which a cDNA-free sample was prepared for PCR and treated like the extracted samples .
The amplified products were electrophoresed , blotted , hybridized with a radiolabeled E2F-1 probe , and visualized by autoradiography .

levels similar to wild type Tax whereas Tax M47 was able to stimulate only about 2-fold ( Fig .
6 ) .
From these results , we conclude that Tax transactivation of the E2F-1 promoter is independent on NF- « B but involves the ATF pathway .
To further map the regulatory elements of the E2F1 promoter required for activation by Tax , a series of 5 truncation mutants of pGL2-AN ( 48 ) were cotransfected with pSG-Tax ( Fig .
7 ) .
The deletion that encompasses the 5 ' region of the promoter , from position -211 to -131 , increased the stimulation by Tax ( from 6-fold for the wild type to 10-fold for the deleted promoter ) , suggesting that Spl binding sites could have an inhibitory effect on the E2F-1 promoter activation by Tax .
Although the deletion of the CCAAT box had no effect , the deletion of ATF binding motif significantly reduced the activation by Tax ( from 10-fold to 5.5-fold ) .
Finally , the deleted pGL2-AN vector containing the E2F binding sites was still stimulated by Tax , confirming the results already described in this paper with the plasmid p3xE2F-WT-lue that contained three copies of the E2F binding site .
Taken together , these results confirm the involvement of an ATF-dependent pathway , at least in part , in the transcriptional control of E2F-1 gene by Tax .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 283602 ATF Pathway Is Necessary but Not Sufficient to Explain the Transactivation by Tax-In this paper , we show that Tax is able to activate E2F-1-dependent transcription in CEM cells ( Figs .

6 and 7 ) .
Stimulation of the E2F-1 gene by Tax could explain how Tax transactivates E2F-1-dependent transcription .
To determine effects of this stimulation in our tests , transfection assays already described in Fig .

Tax Transactivation of E2F-dependent Transcription luciferase activity by 14-fold .
Since Tax M47 fails to activate ATF-dependent promoters , this stimulation can not be explained by the effect of Tax on the stimulation of the E2F-1 gene through the ATF pathway .
This result confirms the importance of the ATF pathway but also indicates that other activation mechanisms could contribute to E2F-1 stimulation by Tax .
DISCUSSION The regulation of E2F is a key target for oncoviruses .
Binding of pRB and the other pocket proteins to ligands such as , adenovirus ELA , simian virus large T antigen , and papilloma-virus E7 , leads to a stimulation of E2F -dependent transcription and cellular transformation ( 54-56 ) .
The human cytomegalov-irus IE72 protein is able to phosphorylate E2F-1-3 and the pocket proteins p107 and p130 , and this phosphorylation step would play an essential role in the mechanism of cell proliferation ( 57 ) .
Induction of E2F DNA binding activity in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and leukemic cells obtained from ATL patients ( 31 ) suggests that the activation of E2F-dependent transcription by HTLV-I could also be involved in the prolifer-ative response during HTLV-I infection .
Suzuki et al .
( 33 ) demonstrated that Tax interacted with p16 '' ~** '' and suggested that the inactivation of p16 '' ~** '' by Tax would contribute to cellular immortalization and transformation induced by HTLV-I infection .
The observations that Tax released T-lymphocytes from cell cycle arrest induced by but also that p16 '' ~** '' overexpression blocked Tax-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis ( 34 ) are effectively consistent with a deregulation of cell cycle progression by Tax in a pendent manner .
However , these results did not exclude the possibility that Tax could also activate E2F-dependent transcription in a p16 '' ~**-independent manner .
In this report , we demonstrate that Tax stimulates the activity of E2F-1 and E2F-4 in CEM T-cells , which lack expression of p16 ' '' ~* '' .
This stimulation is abrogated by mutations affecting the E2F binding sites , thereby confirming that stimulation by Tax is due to direct effect of the binding of E2F-1 and E2F-4 to E2F boxes .
In addition , we demonstrate that ( i ) Tax stimulates E2F-1 mRNA synthesis in Jurkat cells , ( ii ) Tax transactivates the E2F-1 promoter , and ( iii ) this transactivation is dependent , at least in part , on the ATF pathway .
Tax is well known to interact directly with proteins of the ATF/CREB family and to stimulate their activity ( 5-7 ) .
Tax interaction with the ATF pathway is important in the development of the neoplastic phenotype in the case of adult rat fibroblasts ( 19 ) , and mutants of Tax , which failed to activate the endogenous Fold increase vs pGL2-basic ad s n w n o Pd ® © o & o OOT w o sl LUCIFERASE LUCIFERASE Fig .

5 ' deletion analysis of the activation of the human EZF-1 promoter by Tax .
CEM cells were cotransfected with 10 ug of the indicated E2F-1 promoter fragment and with 5 ug of pSG-5 ( white ) or pSG-Tax ( black ) .
48 h later , cell extracts were prepared and luciferase and -galactosidase assays were performed .
Luciferase values were normalized for -galactosidase activity and are expressed as -fold increase relative to cells transfected with pGL2-basic alone .

Effect of Tax M47 on the transactivation of EZF-1 .
CEM cells were cotransfected with 0.1 ug of pCMV-E2F-1 , 0.5 ug of pDP1 , and 10 pg of p8xE2F-WT-luc ( E2F-Box ) together with 5 ug of either pSG-5 ( E2F-Box + E2F-1 ) , or pSG-Tax ( E2F-Box + E2F-1 + Tax ) , or pSG-Tax M22 ( E2F-Box + E2F-1 + Tax-M22 ) , or pSG-Tax M47 ( E2F-Box + E2F-1 + Tax-M47 ) .
Luciferase values were normalized for B-galactosidase activity .
The activity of luciferase gene driven by E2F-Box in the absence of E2F-1 was arbitrarily given a value of 1 , and the activities of the other transfections were adjusted relative to this activity .

ATF pathway , had a reduced ability to induce tumors in trans-genic mice ( 58 ) .
Stimulation of E2F-1 mRNA at the transcriptional level may be a critical step in cell cycle control .
Overproduction of E2F-1 can induce cell proliferation , presumably by titrating pRB from the relevant promoter and thus leading resting cells to inappropriate entry into S phase ( 59 , 60 ) , but can also induce p53-dependent apoptosis ( 61 , 62 ) .
However , it has been shown that p53 is fully inactivated by Tax in the HTLV-I-transformed T-cells ( 63 , 64 ) , confirming that stimulation of E2F-1 gene by Tax could effectively be involved in T-cell transformation .
The activation by ATF pathway of the E2F-1 promoter is not sufficient to completely explain the effect of Tax on E2F-mediated transcription in T-cells .
Indeed , the mutant Tax M47 that fails to activate ATF pathway remains able to transactivate exogenous E2F-1 , suggesting that a mech-anism , not yet characterized , could be also involved in a p16 '' ~ '' * '' -independent activation of E2F-mediated transcription by Tax .
Growth factors such as IL-2 are necessary to carry T-cells from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle .
The ability of Tax to stimulate the transcription of IL-2 and to trigger the constitutive expression of the « subunit of its receptor , IL-2Ra , has led to the hypothesis that constitutive signaling by the IL-2 receptor may be a key factor in developing ATL ( 65 ) .
However , a progression from IL-2 dependence to independence has been observed in HTLV-I immortalized cells ( 66-68 ) , and expression of the IL-2Ra was recently reported as being unnecessary to the in vitro growth of HTLV-I transformed cell lines ( 69 ) .
Signaling cascades initiated by IL-2 include protein kinase-de-pendent pathways involving the Lick and Fyn kinases ( 70 ) , two Janus family kinases , Jaks 1 and 3 ( 71 , 72 ) , and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3SK ) ( 73 ) .
It is well established that neither the Lick nor the Fyn kinases are expressed in HTLV-I-infected human T-cells ( 17 , 74 ) , whereas the Jak/STAT pathway is constitutively activated in HTLV-I immortalized cells ( 75 , 76 ) suggesting that this pathway could participate in HTLV-I-mediated T-cell transformation .
Although the mecha- 23603 nism by which HTLV-I transformation induces activation of the Jak pathway is not well understood , Tax is probably not involved in this activation ( 75 ) .
On the other hand , a recent report suggests that PI3SK is both necessary and sufficient to couple the IL-2R to the transcriptional activation of E2F in T-cells ( 73 ) , E2F transcriptional activity being regulated by the action of PI3K on the activation of protein kinase B. Inhibition of PI3K inhibits phosphorylation of pRB , induction of cyclin D3 , and degradation of p27** '' ' ( 73 ) .
Altogether , these results establish a crucial PI3K/protein kinase B-mediated link between the IL-2 receptor and the cell cycle machinery .
Thus , the direct activation of this pathway by Tax could contribute to explain the activation of E2F-mediated transcription by Tax and the switch to IL-2 independence in HTLV-I immortalized cells .
Yet other mechanisms could explain the effects of Tax including , for example , the direct interaction of Tax with E2F-1 , as described for several cellular transcriptional factors .
Experiments are under way to further elucidate the role of Tax in E2F-mediated transcription independently on p16 '' ~*** .
The identification of this novel mechanism will provide a useful tool to understand how HTLV-I could induce T-cell transformation .
Addendum-During the submission of this paper , Neuveut et al .
( 77 ) published results indicating that Tax can increase cyclin D-edk activity and induce a phosphorylation of cyclin D8 in T-cells null for p16 '' ~* '' 4 .
They suggested that this Tax-associated phosphorylation of cyclin D3 might stabilize the cyclin-cdk complexes , and thus enhance the pRB phosphorylation and increase the E2F transcriptional activity .
