Collins , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , April 16 , 1997 ( received for review January 27 , 1997 ) ABSTRACT CCAAT /enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) £ is a recently cloned member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin .
The human C/EBP & gene is transcribed by two alternative promoters , Pa and PB .
A combination of differential splicing and alternative use of promoters generates four mRNA isoforms , of 2.6 kb and 1.3-1.5 kb in size .
These transcripts can encode three proteins of calculated molecular mass 32.2 kDa , 27.8 kDa , and 14.3 kDa .
Accord-ingly , Western blots with antibodies specific for the DNA-binding domain , that is common to all forms , identify multiple proteins .
mRNA was greatly induced during in vitro granulocytic differentiation of human primary CD34* cells .
Retinoic acid treatment of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells for 24 hr induced C/EBP : mRNA levels by 4-fold , while prolonged treatment gradually reduced mRNA expression to pretreatment levels .
Transient transfection experiments with expression vectors for two of the isoforms demonstrated that the 32.2-kDa protein is an activator of transcription of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter , while the 14.3-kDa protein is not .
Thus , C/EBP : is regulated in a complex fashion and may play a role in the regulation of genes involved in myeloid differentiation .
Hematopoietic stem cells have the ability to promote continuous self-renewal by controlled proliferation and expansive differentiation into all cells of hematopoietic lineages .
Regulation of the molecular mechanisms that direct cellular proliferation and differentiation during hematopoiesis depends , partly , on the action of certain transcription factors ( 1-3 ) .
Several members of the basic region-leucine zipper ( bZIP ) class of transcription factors , including the CCAAT binding protein ( C/EBP ) family have been implicated in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells ( 1-5 ) .
C/EBP proteins have highly conserved bZIP C-terminal regions , but differ in their N-terminal regions ( 6 , 7 ) .
A consensus site , 5'-A , qT ; 1T ; G1C , GoC1AzAsT4-3 ' , has been identified as the target for interactions between DNA and the C/EBP proteins that bind to such sites either as homodimers or heterodimers ( 8 ) .
Dimerization is a prerequisite for the ability of these proteins to bind DNA .
To date , six mammalian members have been characterized , C/EBPa , C/EBPB , C/EBPy , C/EBP3 , C/EBPs , and C/EBPZ ( 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 ) .
C/EBPa , C/EBPB , and C/EBP8 are activators of transcription and are able to transactivate a variety of target genes .
In contrast , C/EBPy and The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .

The high degree of similarity of the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of the C/EBP proteins allows for the formation of a variety of C/EBP homodimers or heterodimers .
The kind of dimer is determined by the nuclear composition of the C/EBP proteins in a given cell and dictates the expression of a distinct set of genes .
Thus , with a relatively small number of transcriptional regulators , the expression of a large number of target genes can be tightly controlled .
Recent studies have suggested that interactions between C/EBP members and CREB/ATF ( 13 ) , Fos-Jun family ( 14 ) , and NF- « B proteins ( 15 , 16 ) may occur , increasing the pool of available interacting transcription factors .
The human C/EBPs gene was recently cloned and its location assigned to chromosome 14 ( 9 , 10 ) .
The murine C/EBPs gene is located on mouse chromosome 14 ( 17 ) .
To further understand the role of C/EBPs in the regulation of genes involved in hematopoiesis and to gain insight into the expression and function of C/EBPsz , we have determined the structural organization of both the human and murine C/EBPs genes .
Differential splicing and alternative use of promoters in the human locus generates a total of four C/EBPs transcripts of 2.6 kb and 1.3-1.5 kb in size .
These transcripts encode three proteins of calculated molecular mass 32.2 kDa , 27.8 kDa , and 14.3 kDa .
C/EBPs mRNA was greatly induced during in vitro granulocytic differentiation of human primary CD34* cells .
Retinoic acid treatment of HL6O0 and U937 cells for 24 hr induced C/EBPs mRNA levels by approximately 4-fold , while prolonged treatment gradually reduced mRNA expression to pretreatment levels .
The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor gene is a critical gene for myeloid differentiation , particularly for the production of neutrophils ( 18 ) .
Transient transfection experiments with expression vectors for two C/EBPsz protein isoforms and the myeloid-specific G-CSF receptor promoter reporter gene construct , suggest a role for C/EBPs in the regulation of G-CSF receptor , a critical gene for myelogenesis .

We constructed cDNA libraries from HL60 ( human promyelocytic leukemia ) and MNFS 60 [ myelogenous leukemia , monocyte CSF ( M-CSF ) -dependent , mouse ] cell lines using 2 ug of poly ( A ) * RNA as templates .
The PCR primers used to detect C/EBPs mRNA expression were RY 66 , RY 46 , and RY 44 in combination with RY 77 .
Control B-actin-specific cDNA primers were from CLONTECH .
mRNA was extracted ( 19 ) from primary human T cells , B cells , neutrophils and macrophages , and several cell lines including human Molt-4 lymphoblastic leukemia , KG1a acute myelogenous leukemia , HL60 , U937 monocytic leukemia , RS4 ; 11 t ( 4 ; 11 ) acute leukemia and Jurkat acute T cell leuke-mia .
Human poly ( A ) * RNA from bone marrow , fetal liver , lymph node , spleen , and thymus ( CLONTECH ] ) and cell lines Daudi , Raji Burkitt lymphomas , and K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CLONTECH ] ) were also used as templates for first-strand synthesis .
Northern blots with approximately 20 ug of RNA per lane were hybridized ( 9 ) , using two C/EBPs specific probes : a 3 ' terminal 500-bp PstI fragment from a human cDNA clone ( 9 ) or a 306-bp PCR-generated fragment spanning nucleotides 3,254 to 3,560 ( GenBank no .

To assure uniform loading , the blots were stripped and hybridized to oligonucle-otides specific for either the 188 RNA , nucleotides 938-921 ( 20 ) , or 288 RNA , nucleotides 4,036-4,020 ( 21 ) .
Primary Cells , Cell Lines , and Transient Transfection Experiments .
Human primary CD34* cells , peripheral blood monocytes , and neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors as described ( 22 ) .
CD34 *-enriched cells were plated in human myeloid long-term culture medium supplemented with 300 units/ml G-CSF ( G ) , 3 units/ml erythropoietin , or a combination of 1 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage-CSF and 200 ng/ml M-CSF ( GM + M ) and cultured for 11 days ( 22 ) .
At the end of each differentiation experiment cells were stained by the Wright-Giemsa method , and differential cell counts were performed .
U937 , HL60 , and K562 cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and 2 nM L-glutamine .
To induce in vitro erythrocytic differentiation , K562 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 1.5 % dimethyl ] sulfoxide ( DMSO ) for up to 5 days .
U937 and HL6O0 cells were treated for 2 days with either 1.3 x 10- '' M phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate ( TPA ) for monocytic differentiation or with 10~-° M retinoic acid for 4 days to induce granulocytic differentiation .
HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and were transiently transfected at 70 % confluency by liposome-mediated transfection reagent DOTAP ( N- [ 1- ( 2,3 ) -dioleoyloxy ) propyl|-N , N , N-trimethylam-monium methylsulfate ) ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .

RESULTS The C/EBP£ Gene Uses Alternative Promoters and Differential Splicing to Generate Several RNA Isoforms .
Consistent with our previously described results ( 9 ) , Northern blot hybridization using RNA from immune tissues and a C/EBP s-specific probe displayed a number of RNA isoforms of predominantly 1.3-1.5 and 2.6 kb in size ( data not shown ) .
To analyze each transcript isoform in detail , we screened a variety of cDNA and genomic libraries to isolate the human and the murine C/EBPs genes .
We found that the C/EBPs gene was most abundant in bone marrow and HL60 cDNA libraries , although we have successfully isolated clones from mouse thymus and MNSF 60 libraries .
Clones with different size inserts and unique or overlapping restriction enzyme patterns were isolated and sequenced .
Several murine genomic C/EBP s clones were also isolated , covering almost 35.5 kb of the locus .
We focused on the human locus and identified three exons by comparing genomic and cDNA clone sequences and by RT-PCR analysis and 5° RACE-PCR using a variety of oligonucleotide combinations and poly ( A ) * RNA templates .
A schematic map of the human C/EBP s locus and all of the C/EBPs RNA transcripts are shown in Fig .
14 .
RNA was extracted from a variety of cells to identify the exon composition of each transcript by RT-PCR .
To confirm that the PCR products were correctly amplified from a C/EBP s template , Southern blot experiments were performed using an internal C/EBPs specific primer as a probe .
A representative set of results from such RT-PCR assays is shown in Fig .
1B , with the expected size shown on the right .
mRNA from bone marrow , neutrophils , and HL60 cells amplified several C/EBPs fragments corresponding to C/EBPs isoforms , as did mRNA from spleen , fetal liver , U937 , RS4 ; 11 , Molt4 , and Daudi cells A nonspecific RT-PCR-amplified product was detected in T cells and macrophages when primers 1 and 5 were used in combination ( Fig .
1B ) .
However , sequence analysis revealed that this fragment is not related to C/EBPs .
The presence of several differentially spliced C/EBPs mRNA species was confirmed by the isolation of 27 cDNA clones obtained from a human bone marrow cDNA library .
The last exon encoding the bZIP domain was present in all cDNA clones ; however , several differences were found in the 5 ' end regions of the inserts .
Pa3 contains exon 1 , which is 436 bp long and includes two in-frame AUG initiation codons that are separated by 3 bp ( see also Fig .
3B ) .
Pa2 and Pa3 differ in that they use two different splice donor sites in exon 1 to splice to the same acceptor site in exon 2 , as shown in Fig .
1 4 .
Finally , the last exon of 334 bp , contains the bZIP domain of the molecule and is present in all C/EBPs isoforms .
To determine the start site of the bone marrow cDNA clones we performed 5 ' RACE assays .
Sequence analysis of the bone marrow cDNA clones and 5 ' RACE from mRNA derived from HL60 cells confirmed that they were genuine products of differentially spliced RNA transcripts .
The start site identified in these clones was different due to the alternate use of two promoters , Pa and PB ( Fig .
2 ) .
Thus , in addition to differential splicing , alternative use of promoters also contributes to the differences at the 5 ' end region .
Several 5° RACE-PCR independent clones were sequenced to determine the initiation nucleotides shown for each promoter ( Fig .
2 , arrows ) .
The equivalent promoter regions of human and murine genes were very conserved around the PB promoter but not the Pa promoter region ( data not shown ) .
Both Pa and PB promoter regions lack any obvious TATAAA or CAAT-like motifs .
Similar to other TATA-less promoter regions of genes expressed in the hematopoietic system , a number of purine-rich stretches lie upstream of both start sites ( Fig .
2 ) .
Several sites for the consensus sequences for PU.1 ( an ets factor ) RRR-GAGGAAG were also found .

four mRNA isoforms shown in Fig .
14 can give rise to three proteins that have the same basic DNA-binding domain but differ in the N-terminal part ( Fig .
3 ) .
A band of varying intensity between experiments was also detected around 30 kDa .
It may represent a degradation product of the larger protein or a nonspecific cross-reacting protein .
There are five in-frame AUG codons , but only three satisfy the Kozak context GCC ( A/G ) CCAUGG ( 26 ) .
Transcripts Pal and PBI have identical reading frames with an ORF of 281 amino acids and have the capacity to generate two proteins of 32.2 kDa and 27.3 kDa .
There is another in-frame AUG codon 32 amino residues downstream of the first ( see Fig .
3B ) , However , initiation of translation at this downstream codon is less likely because of an imperfect match to the Kozak context ( 26 ) .
Furthermore , in vitro transcription-translation assays in rabbit reticulocyte lysates strongly favors initiation at the first AUG ( data not shown ) .
Transcripts Pa2 and Pa3 can generate two proteins of 27.8 kDa and 14.3 kDa with the same basic domain as the previous proteins .
Both AUG codons lie in a relatively strong Kozak context .
Thus , several proteins can be encoded by the C/EBP sz gene , and these proteins can be detected by Western blot analysis in MNFS60 , U937 , and HL60 ( Fig .
34 ) .
Two of the protein isoforms ( 32.3 kDa and 14.3 kDa ) were used for transfection experiments ( see below ) .

USA 94 ( 1997 ) 6465 Induction of C/EBPE mRNA Expression Correlates with Granulocytic Differentiation .
Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from human primary CD34 * cells showed that early progenitor cells do not express significant levels of C/EBPs mRNA ( Fig .
44 , day 0 ) .
To test for steady-state C/EBPs mRNA levels during in vitro differentiation of primary human CD34 * cells enriched from peripheral blood of healthy donors , cells were plated in the presence of GM-CSF and M-CSF ( GM + M ) , G-CSF ( G ) or erythropoietin ( Epo ) .
C/EBPs gene expression was detected in granulocytic cells after 8 days of culture and was greatly induced at day 11 of differentiation ( Fig .
44 , G , 8 and 11 ) .
Control hybridizations of the same blot shows that the RNA samples in these two lanes have migrated evenly ( 288 control and data not shown ) .
However , careful comparison between the two hybridizing bands at 8 and 11 indicated that the RNA form at day 11 is larger , possibly corresponding to a different C/EBP isoform ( see below ) .
In accordance with the 5'-RACE results RNA extracted from HL60 cells displays multiple C/EBPzs RNA isoforms ( Fig .
44 ; lane marked HL60 ) .
Finally , as shown in Fig .
4B , mature human neutrophils purified from peripheral blood of healthy donors express high levels of the long Pal isoform of C/EBPs whereas human monocytes do not express any detectable amounts of C/EBPs mRNA .
We also tested whether C/EBPs is induced during granulocytic differentiation of several human leukemic cell lines .

U937 and HL60 cells were treated for 2 days with 1.3 X 10~ ' M TPA ( +TPA ) for monocytic differentiation or with 107° M retinoic acid ( +RA ) for 4 days for granulocytic differentiation .
Northern blot was performed at time points indicated above each lane , as described above with the exception that RNA was normalized to 188 ribosomal RNA ( Lower ) .
6466 Medical Sciences : Yamanaka et al .
K562 cells were treated with 1.5 % DMSO for 5 days to induce erythrocytic differentiation ; U937 and HL60 cells were treated either with 1.3 X 10- '' M TPA to induce monocytic differentiation for 2 days , or with 10~° M retinoic acid for 4 days for granulocytic differentiation .
No expression of C/EBPs mRNA was detected in DMSO-treated or untreated K562 cells , consistent with the results obtained from the erythroid differentiation of primary CD34 * cells ( Fig .
4C ) .
In contrast , approximately a 4-fold induction of C/EBPs steady-state mRNA levels in HL60 cells was detected after retinoic acid treatment ( Fig .
4C ) .
However , this induction was transient because prolonged treatment with retinoic acid did not sustain these high levels ( Fig .
4C , +RA 2-4 ) .
A similar induction was detected after 1-day treatment of U937 cells with retinoic acid ( Fig .
4C ) .
TPA treatment did not have any effect on the levels of C/EBPs RNA in U937 but it decreased the levels of C/EBPs RNA in HL60 cells .
Thus , we conclude that C/EBPs is preferentially expressed during in vitro differentiation of primary cells to granulocytes , but not monocytes , and is strongly induced by retinoic acid in granulocytic cells .
The C/EBP£ Gene Encodes Several Proteins with Different Transactivation Potential .
To test the transactivation potential of two of the C/EBP protein isoforms , the longest 32.2 kDa and the shortest 14.3 kDa , we generated pCMV-based expression constructs for both isoforms .
The integrity of each expression construct was verified by sequence .
These plasmids , a full-length C/EBPa expression construct and a wild-type and mutant G-CSF receptor-luciferase reporter , were used to transfect HeLa cells that do not express detectable levels of C/EBPa « or C/EBPs .
A cytomegalovirus-based lacZ expression vector was also used to normalize for transfection effi-ciency .
As shown in Fig .
5 , at low plasmid doses both C/EBPa and C/EBP z '' expression constructs were able to transactivate the G-CSF receptor promoter 3-fold and 2-fold , respectively .

Activation of G-CSF receptor promoter-luciferase reporter construct by C/EBPa and C/EBPs in cotransfected HeLa cells .
The G-CSF receptor-luciferase wild type ( WT ) and mutant ( Mut ) have been described ( 24 ) .
Increasing amounts of expression plasmids for C/EBPs or 0.5 ug of C/EBPa were cotransfected with a constant amount ( 5 ug ) of both G-CSF receptor-luciferase reporter plasmids and 1 ug of B-galactosidase ( pCMVB ) reporter .
The amount of transfected DNA was adjusted with vector DNA to 10 ug per dish .
The values are presented as a percentage of fold transactivation over the reporter .
The experiments were repeated at least four times .

USA 94 ( 1997 ) relatively low , but this tranasctivation potential was consistently recorded over several independent experiments performed in duplicate and was not significantly affected by different plasmid DNA preparations .
In contrast , C/EBPs '' failed to transactivate the reporter gene .
Mutation of the C/EBP -binding site prevented activation by any of the C/EBP expression vectors .
Thus , the short 14.3-kDa protein isoform lacks the transactivation potential of the longer variant .
DISCUSSION The C/EBP gene family includes six members characterized by highly conserved basic DNA binding and leucine zipper dimerization domains ( 7 , 27 , 28 ) .
In this study we describe several distinct features of the C/EBPs gene regulation and mRNA expression patterns that distinguish C/EBPs from the other C/EBP members .
The C/EBPs gene is transcribed by two alternative promoters , Pa and PB , with a cell-type specificity .
Differential splicing of the C/EBPsz transcriptional unit generates several mRNA isoforms and adds to the complexity of the regulation of this gene .
All isoforms share the same last exon that encodes for the bZIP carboxyl-terminal domain and have identical 3 ' untranslated regions .
However , the N-terminal regions of each protein are different .
The structure of the mouse gene is similar to the human as are the sequences at the exon/intron boundaries and the PB promoter region ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , there is a pronounced homology of 92.8 % at the amino acid sequence level between the two 32.2-kDa protein isoforms ( data not shown ) .
The deduced amino acid sequence of the longest human C/EBPs is 281 amino acids using Pal and PB1 RNA as translational templates .
Alternative translational initiation from this RNA isoform is possible because there are three in-frame AUG codons ( see Fig .
3B ) .
Based on sequence comparisons between the different members of the C/EBP family we speculated earlier that C/EBP s is most related to C/EBPa ( 9 ) .
The homology starts in the N-terminal region of C/EBPa and the C/EBPs 32.2-kDa isoform , suggesting that the first start codon of this isoform is the dominant translational initiation codon .
In vitro transcription/ translation of a C/EBPs cDNA template encoding the Pal and PBI form shows that the first upstream AUG codon is used efficiently in vitro , generating a protein of 32.3 kDa .
Another protein is encoded by transcript P « 2 , which is 129 amino acids long and has a calculated molecular mass of 14.3 kDa .
Finally , a third protein that is 252 amino acids long and has a calculated molecular mass of 27.8 kDa is encoded by transcript Pa3 .
In several tissues and cell lines tested the PBI1 transcript is by far the most abundant ( this study and refs .
9 and 10 ) .
Thus , it is likely that the main molecular mechanism for control of C/EBPs gene expression is transcriptional regulation that favors initiation from the PB promoter region .
This region is also the predominant promoter driving expression of the C/EBPs gene in mice .
Other C/EBP family members that lack introns use alternative translation initiation to generate functionally different factors .
C/EBPB or LAP can generate two proteins with distinct functions , LAP acts as an activator and LIP as a repressor that shares the same bZIP region with LAP but lacks the N-terminal activation domain identified in LAP ( 29 ) .
Similarly , C/EBPa is translated into multiple proteins with different transactivation potentials ( 30 ) .
All of these proteins share the same bZIP C-terminal domain but differ in their N-terminal amino acid sequences .
A ribosome-scanning mechanism that selectively uses different in-frame AUGs to initiate translation from the same mRNA template has been suggested to explain the production of multiple C/EBPa proteins ( 30 ) .
Thus , N-terminally truncated forms are produced by several C/EBP family members , including C/EBP s , and are present in different vertebrate species such as rat , mouse , human , chicken , and Xenopus ( 30 ) .
Isoforms of transcriptional regulators that lack the transactivation domain are not uncommon Medical Sciences : Yamanaka et al .
among transcription factors that act as dimers .
A heterodimer that contains an activator and a repressor will not be functional because only one activation domain is available .
A variety of such examples have been described such as erbAa , mTFE3 , Fos B , and I-POU ( reviewed in ref .
31 ) .
Repressors can block transcriptional activation as homodimers by occupying an important regulatory element on a target gene .
Several studies have demonstrated heterodimer formation between the C/EBP family members , including interactions of C/EBPs with C/EBPa , C/EBP , and C/EBPS8 ( 27 , 32 , 33 ) .
However , the number of possible combinations of homodimers or heterodimers in a particular cell is reduced by the fact that the C/EBP genes are expressed in different cell types .
We reported previously that expression of the C/EBPs gene is restricted to tissues of the immune system ( 9 ) .
The present data demonstrate that expression of C/EBPs mRNA correlates with granulocytic differentiation of primary CD34¢ cells .
It is also detectable in CD34*CD33* committed precursors and is highly expressed in CD11b* individual myeloid bone marrow cells ( D. Scadden , personal communication ) .
Finally , C/EBPs mRNA is preferentially expressed in primary neutrophils .
Retinoic acid treatment of HL60 promyelocytic cells to promote a granulocytic-like differentiation program greatly induces C/EBPs mRNA , suggesting a role for C/EBP z in this pathway .
PU.1 and C/EBPa are both expressed early in myeloid differentiation ( 34 ) .
Both of these factors together with a nonidentified `` band-X '' factor have been shown to be involved in the regulation of the G-CSF receptor promoter ( 24 ) .
The transactivation potential of the long form of C/EBPs on G-CSF promoter reporter construct , although low under our experimental conditions , indicates that C/EBP s may also be involved in the regulation of this gene .
The myeloperoxidase gene initiates transcription from two promoters separated by approximately 400 bp ( 35 ) , and is a target of C/EBP proteins and PU.1 during granulocytic differentiation ( 36 ) .
C/EBPa , C/EBP B , and C/EBP8 are expressed in an overlapping manner during in vitro granulocytic differentiation of A4 multi-potential progenitor cells ( 36 ) .
Based on its expression pattern C/EBPs may also interact with the myeloperoxidase promoter regions .
The functional versatility of the C/EBPs gene is mirrored by the number of C/EBPs RNA isoforms that are produced in a cell-and tissue-specific manner .
Alternative use of promoters and differential splicing of the primary transcriptional unit , unique among the C/EBP family members , results in ORFs that change the characteristics of the protein and may modulate its physiological role .
Such molecular mechanisms are shared by other transcriptional regulators with modular structures such as CREM ( 37 ) , CREB ( 38 ) , and HLF ( 39 ) .
The modulatory structure of the C/EBP s gene may also be an indication of its evolutionary origin , perhaps reflecting an assembly of subunits with distinct function .
The use of alternative promoter regions that are somewhat related may indicate that a duplication of the first modular unit has recently occurred .
It is a tantalizing possibility that C/EBPs may be the evolutionary remnant of a primordial C/EBP gene with a modular structure .
The significance of the C/EBPsz gene as an important regulator of the differentiation process in hematopoiesis has not yet been demonstrated in vivo .
Our data suggest that this protein may be important in the regulation of certain genes such as the G-CSF receptor and plays a role in granulocytic differentiation .
The ultimate demonstration of the role of C/EBP s in the hematopoietic system may have to wait for a functional analysis of this gene using the powerful tools of mouse genetics .
