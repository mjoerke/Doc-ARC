However , the signaling events responsible for these effects remain unclear .
The present studies have examined the effects of M-CSF on potential signaling pathways involving expression of the jun and fos early response genes .
Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in resting human peripheral blood monocytes .
Treatment of these cells with 10° units/ml human recombinant M-CSF was associated with rapid and transient increases in c-jun mRNA levels .
Nuclear run-on assays and mRNA stability studies demonstrated that M-CSF regulates c-jun expression by both an increase in transcription rate and a prolongation in the half-life of c-jun transcripts .
M-CSF treatment was also associated with a rapid induction of the jun-B gene , although expression of this gene was prolonged compared to that of c-jun .
We further demonstrate that M-CSF increases c-fos mRNA levels in human monocytes through control at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .
Maximal induction of the c-fos gene was followed by that for the fos-B gene .
Moreover , M-CSF-induced expression of the fos-related gene , fra-1 , was delayed compared to that for both c-fos and fos-B .
Taken together , the results indicate that M-CSF treatment is associated with differential activation of multiple members of the jun/ fos family and that expression of these genes could contribute to nuclear signaling mechanisms that regulate a specific program of monocyte differentiation .
Introduction The M-CSP is sufficient for the survival , proliferation , and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes ( 1 ) .

teins with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity ( 2 , 3 ) .
Ligand binding induces autophosphorylation and down-regulation of the c-fms protein ( 4 ) .
Multiple other substrates for tyrosine phosphorylation have been detected following activation of this receptor ( 5-7 ) .
Although the identity of these substrates has in part remained unclear , recent studies have demonstrated that the M-CSF receptor associates with and activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 8 , 9 ) .
M-CSF also stimulates protein synthesis , glucose uptake , and Nat , K*-ATPase activity in macrophages ( 10-12 ) .
Other studies have suggested that the activated M-CSF receptor stimulates a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTPase activity and that M-CSF induces certain pertussis toxin-sensitive signaling events ( 13-15 ) .
Otherwise , there are few insights regarding pathways activated by ligand binding to this receptor .
Previous studies have demonstrated that M-CSF stimulation of murine macrophages and the BAC1.2F5 macrophage cell line is associated with a rapid and transient increase in c-fos gene expression ( 16-18 ) .
A rapid induction of c-fos expression similarly occurs during phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells to macrophages ( 19-21 ) .
The c-fos gene encodes a nuclear protein which participates in the formation of the AP-1 transcription factor complex ( 22 ) .
A major component of this complex is the product of the c-jun protooncogene ( 22 ) .
This gene is also induced as an immediate early response to certain growth factors and phorbol esters ( 23-25 ) .
The Jun/AP-1 complex binds to a heptomeric DNA consensus sequence TGA®/.TCA ( TRE ) ( 26 ) .
The affinity of Jun/AP-1 binding to the TRE is related to the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with fos proteins ( 27-29 ) .
Jun-B is another member of the jun family that forms dimers and binds to the TRE ( 30 , 31 ) , although the properties of c-Jun and Jun-B differ in that Jun-B inhibits the transcription of genes activated by c-jun ( 31 , 32 ) .
However , it is not known whether M-CSF regulates the expression of either c-jun or jun-B in myeloid cells .
The present studies have examined the effects of M-CSF on c-jun expression in human peripheral blood monocytes .
The results demonstrate that M-CSF increases c-jun expression by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms .
The results further demonstrate that M-CSF increases jun-B mRNA levels in these cells .
Since jun forms heterodimers with fos proteins , we have also studied the effects of M-CSF on c-fos and fos-related genes in these cells .
Results Studies were performed to determine the effects of M-CSF on c-jun expression in human peripheral blood monocytes .
There was a low but detectable level of c-jun transcripts in resting monocytes ( Fig .
1A ) .
In contrast , treatment with 10° units/ml M-CSF was associated with a rapid increase in c-jun expression that was detectable 268 - M-CSF Induces jun and fos Gene Expression in Human Monocytes Monocytes F O ( m 2 < 9 ) m- ® 28S-I .

Effects of M-CSF on c-jun and jun-B mRNA levels in human monocytes .

at 15 min and reached maximal levels at 30 min ( Fig .
1A ) .
Longer exposures were associated with down-regulation of c-jun transcripts to pretreatment levels ( Fig .
14 ) .
M-CSF treatment was also associated with expression of the jun-B gene .
jun-B transcripts were similarly increased by 15 min of M-CSF exposure and remained elevated for longer periods than that for the c-jun gene ( Fig .
14 ) .
The effects of M-CSF on expression of these genes were concentration dependent .
Expression of both the c-jun and jun-B genes was increased following exposure to 10 units/ml M-CSF for 15 min ( Fig .
1B ) .
Furthermore , stimulation with higher M-CSF concentrations was associated with progressive increases in levels of these transcripts ( Fig .
1B ) .
In contrast , boiling the M-CSF ( 10° units/ml ) for 30 min completely abrogated these effects ( data not shown ) .
Previous studies in murine macrophages have demonstrated that M-CSF rapidly induces expression of the c-fos gene ( 16-18 ) .
Similar findings were obtained in the present studies with human monocytes .
c-fos transcripts were present at low levels in these cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
However , an increase in c-fos expression was detectable by 15 min of M-CSF stimulation and then declined to levels similar to those in untreated cells by 3 h ( Fig .
24 ) .
Similar findings were obtained for two c-fos-related genes .
For example , fos-B and fra-1 mRNA levels were at low levels in unstimulated monocytes .
Maximal increases in fos-B expression were obtained at 30 min , whereas fra-1 transcripts reached highest levels by 1 h of M-CSF stimulation ( Fig .
24 ) .
The effects of M-CSF on fos gene expression were also concentration dependent .
Exposure of monocytes to 10 units/ml M-CSF was associated with increases in c-fos transcripts , whereas maximal expression of this gene was achieved with 5 X 10° units/ml ( Fig .
2B ) .
Taken together , these findings indicate that M-CSF transiently increases expression of multiple genes in the c-jun and c-fos families .
Previous studies have demonstrated that TPA increases c-jun expression in myeloid cells by activation of this gene at the transcriptional level ( 33 ) .
Run-on assays were performed to determine whether M-CSF similarly induces transcription of this gene in monocytes .
Nuclear RNA was isolated from monocytes treated with 10° units/ ml M-CSF for 15 min and hybridized to actin and c-jun DNAs .
The actin gene was transcriptionally active in resting monocytes ( Fig .
3 ) .
Furthermore , there was no detectable effect of M-CSF on transcription of this gene .
Low but detectable levels of c-jun gene transcription were found in untreated monocytes ( Fig .
3 ) .
In contrast , M-CSF stimulation was associated with a 2.9-fold ( deter-mined by densitometric scanning ) increase in the c-jun transcriptional rate ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similar results were obtained for the c-fos gene ( Fig .
3 ) .
In this regard , c-fos gene transcription was increased 2.0-fold following M-CSF stimulation ( Fig .
3 ) .
The c-jun gene is also regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation ( 33 ) .
Consequently , we compared the stability of the c-jun transcript in resting and M-CSF-stimulated monocytes .
Resting monocytes were treated with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription and then monitored for c-jun mRNA levels .
The half-life of c-jun mRNA in these cells as determined by densitometric scanning was 17 min ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast , treatment of the monocytes with M-CSF for 15 min and then addition of actinomycin D was associated with a prolongation of the half-life to 27 min ( Fig .
4 ) .
These findings were comparable to those obtained for the c-fos transcript .
The half-life of c-fos mRNA in resting monocytes was 13 min , whereas M-CSF treatment was associated with an increase to 25 min ( Fig .
4 ) .
Taken together , these findings indicate that M-CSF regulates expression of the c-jun and c-fos genes by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms .

Nuclei were isolated , and newly elongated `` P-labeled RNA transcripts were hybridized to 2 ug of actin , c-jun , or c-fos DNA insert after restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blotting .
As compared to that for the actin gene , c-jun gene transcription was increased 2.9-fold and c-fos gene transcription by 2.0-fold following M-CSF stimulation .
Similar findings were obtained for the c-jun gene ( 2.9- and 1.9-fold increases ) and the cfos gene ( 2.0- and 1.5-fold increases ) in two independent experiments .

whereas treatment with M-CSF was associated with increases in the expression of this gene ( Fig .
5 ) .
This effect of M-CSF was maximal at 1 h and then followed by down-regulation of these transcripts to near baseline levels at 6 h ( Fig .
5 ) .
In contrast , the TGF-B gene was constitutively expressed in resting monocytes , and there was little , if any , effect of M-CSF on levels of these transcripts ( Fig .
5 ) .
Moreover , there was no detectable effect of M-CSF on c-myc or c-myb mRNA levels in the M-CSF-stimulated monocytes ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that induction of jun/fos gene expression by M-CSF is associated with activation to a more differentiated monocytic phenotype .
Discussion The present studies demonstrate that activation of resting human monocytes with M-CSF is associated with rapid and transient increases in expression of the c-jun gene .
Nuclear run-on assays and mRNA stability studies indicate that this effect of M-CSF on c-jun expression is controlled at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .
Previous work has demonstrated that expression of the c-jun gene is an early event during stimulation of fibroblasts .
For example , c-jun mRNA levels are transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally regulated by serum , platelet-derived growth factor , and fibroblast growth factor in mouse BALB/c 3T3 cells ( 37 ) .
Other work in myeloid cells has demonstrated that the c-jun gene is expressed during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation and monocyte activation by lipopolysaccharide ( 33 , 38 ) .
These studies similarly demonstrated increases in the rate of c-jun transcription and a prolongation in the half-life of the c-jun transcript .
Thus , the present findings suggest that the regulation of c-jun expression in M-CSF-treated monocytes is similar to that in other models of monocytic differentiation or activation .
Although lipopolysaccharide can also increase c-jun mRNA levels ( 38 ) , the possibility that contaminating endotoxin in the M-CSF preparation contributed to the present findings is unlikely .
in this context , boiling the M-CSF completely abolished induction of c-jun expression .

- Stability of the c-jun and c-fos transcripts in resting and M-CSF-treated monocytes .
Resting monocytes ( A ) and monocytes stimulated with 10° units/ml M-CSF for 15 min ( B ) were treated with 5 ug/ml actinomycin D ( act 1 ) for the indicated times .
Total cellular RNA ( 20 g ) was hybridized to the `` P-labeled c-jun and c-fos DNA probes .
Filters prepared with RNA from resting monocytes were overexposed to visualize the signals .
Hybridization to the actin probe revealed equal loading of the lanes .
Similar findings were obtained in two separate experiments .
The c-jun gene is a member of a multigene family coding for products that contain a leucine zipper motif and a highly conserved DNA-binding domain ( 26 ) .
The leucine zipper allows for dimerization between certain members of this family , whereas the basic domain binds to TRE .
Specific protein dimeric complexes contribute to the affinity and specificity of DNA binding ( 28 , 29 ) .
For example , c-jun and c-fos form complexes with a higher DNA-binding affinity than that of c-jun homodimers ( 39 ) .
The finding that M-CSF induces expression of the c-jun and c-fos genes suggests that both Jun/Jun and Jun/Fos complexes can be formed in activated monocytes .
The basis for the formation of these different complexes may be determined by the timing and the magnitude of the response of these genes .
In this regard , maximal induction of the c-jun gene at 30 min of M-CSF stimulation occurred during down-regulation of c-fos transcripts .
The results demonstrate that this rapid induction of the c-fos gene by M-CSF is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .
Similar control of c-fos expression has been obtained in TPA-treated human monocytes ( 40 ) .
M-CSF - or TPA-induced increases in the c-fos product may contribute to transcriptional control of the c-jun gene through the formation of AP-1 and activation of the TRE in the c-jun promoter .
The present findings also demonstrate that M-CSF treatment is associated with increases in the expression of other members of the leucine zipper family .
M-CSF-induced jun-B gene expression was more prolonged than that for the c-jun gene .
Jun-B functions as a negative regulator of genes activated by c-Jun ( 31 , 32 ) and thereby could play a role in the down-regulation of c-jun gene transcription .
In contrast , there was no detectable expression of the jun-D gene ( 41 ) in resting or M-CSF-treated monocytes ( data not shown ) .
Thus , as previously reported in studies with fibroblasts , the jun-D gene is regulated differently than c-jun and jun-B ( 41 ) .
The functional role of Jun-D is unknown , although this protein M-CSF -- -I ] `` OE-CC ® ~ ® © Monocytes 28S- *e ... TNF 18S- 28S- U WU W { 35 ® ® a t ® TGF-8 Fig .

Effects of M-CSF on TNF and TGF-8 gene expression .
Resting monocytes were treated with 10° units/ml M-CSF for the indicated times .
Total cellular RNA ( 20 pg ) was hybridized to the P-labeled TNF and TGF-d probes .
also interacts with c-Fos and has similar binding properties to that of c-Jun ( 42 ) .
The present studies also demonstrate that M-CSF increases expression of the fos-B ( 27 ) and fra- 1 ( 43 ) genes .
The Fos-B protein influences binding of c-Jun and Jun-B ( 27 ) , whereas Fra-1 affects binding of c-jun to the AP-1 site ( 44 ) .
The induction of fos-B expression following M-CSF stimulation was delayed compared to that of c-fos .
Furthermore , M-CSF-induced fra-1 transcripts were detectable after maximal expression of both the c-fos and fos-B genes .
Induction of the fra-1 gene in serum-stimulated fibroblasts is also delayed in comparison to c-fos expression ( 43 ) .
This differential activation of multiple members of the jun/fos family could result in the formation of diverse leucine zipper dimers that regulate a specific program of gene transcription .
The present findings thus suggest that one of the earliest genomic responses to M-CSF involves nuclear signal transduction through activation of jun/fos genes .
The M-CSF-induced cytoplasmic signals that contribute to these effects are unclear .
The activated M-CSF receptor phosphorylates a variety of substrates on tyrosine and is associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity ( 5-9 ) .
Other studies have indicated that M-CSF activates protein kinase C in human monocytes ( 15 ) .
Treatment of resting monocytes with TPA , an activator of protein kinase C , is similarly associated with induction of c-jun ( data not shown ) and c-fos ( 40 ) gene expression .
TPA also induces the expression of TNF and other genes , such as platelet-derived growth factor , that characterize the more differentiated monocytic phenotype ( 36 , 45 ) .
Although the role of protein kinase C in monocyte activation is unknown , the present findings with M-CSF and previous studies with TPA indicate that jun/fos gene expression may represent nuclear signaling mechanisms involved in the induction of monocytic differentiation .
Cell Growth & Differentiation Materials and Methods Monocyte Purification and Culture .
Human monocytes were prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and adherence for 1 h. The adherent cell population was collected with a plastic policeman , washed with three changes of medium , readhered , and then washed again with medium .
The purified cell population consisted of over 95 % monocytes , as judged by morphological examination and a-naphthyl acetate esterase staining .
