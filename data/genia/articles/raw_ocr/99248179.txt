Margolis , '' and Anthony S. Fauci* Transcription factors USF1 and USF2 up-regulate gene expression ( i.e. , HIV-1 long terminal repeats ) via interaction with an E box on their target promoters , which is also a binding site for c-Myc .
The c-Myc oncoprotein is important in control of cellular proliferation and differentiation , while Yin-Yang 1 ( YY1 ) has been shown to control the expression of a number of cellular and viral genes .
These two proteins physically interact with each other and mutually inhibit their respective biological functions .
In this study , we show that USF/c-Myc up-regulates , while YY1 down-regulates the promoter activity of CXCR4 , a coreceptor for T cell-tropic HIV-1 entry .
We have identified an E box around -260 and a YY1 binding site around -300 relative to the transcription start site .
Mutation of the E box abolished USF/c-Myc-mediated up-regulation of CXCR4 promoter activity , and mutation of the YY1 binding site was associated with unresponsiveness to YY1-mediated inhibition .
These data suggest that USF/c-Mye and YY1 may play an important role in the HIV-1-replicative cycle , by modulating both the viral fusion/entry process and viral expression .
- The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 1621 5986-5992. number of cellular factors of the host have been shown to modulate replication of HIV-1 at various steps of the viral replication cycle ( 1 ) .
At the level of viral expression , numerous cellular transcription factors regulate transcription from the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , '' the promoter of HIV-1 .
While many of these factors ( ie. , nuclear factor- « B/Rel family proteins ( 2 ) , C/EBP ( NF-IL6 ) ( 3 , 4 ) , Sp1 ( 5 ) , or USF ( 6 ) ) enhance LTR activity ( reviewed in Ref .
7 ) , a few factors have been shown to directly reduce HIV expression at the promoter level .
YY1 , a multifunctional transcription factor , has been shown to repress a number of cellular and viral gene promoters ( reviewed in Ref .
8 ) , including the HIV-1 LTR ( 9 , 10 ) .
Host cell factors also affect HIV at earlier steps in its replication cycle .
HIV-1 entry into cells requires the CD4 molecule as well as a fusion/entry cofactor ( 11-18 ) .
Several chemokine receptors serve as fusion/entry cofactors , among which CXCR4 , a receptor for CXC chemokine stromal-derived factor ( SDF-1 ) ( 19 , 20 ) , is a major fusion/entry cofactor for T cell-tropic HIV-1 .
Functional expression of CXCR4 is influenced by other host cell factors .
SDF-1 , a ligand of CXCR4 , regulates cell surface expression of CXCR4 ( 21 , 22 ) , whereas IL-2 regulates the steady-state level of CXCR4 mRNA ( 23 ) .
We have recently cloned and analyzed the promoter region of CXCR4 ( 24 ) , and found that two transcription factors , nuclear respiratory factor-1 ( NRF-1 ) and Spl , interact with the proximal region of the CXCR4 promoter , and that the former is critical for CXCR4 promoter activity .

In this study , we characterize the further upstream region of the CXCR4 promoter .
We report that USF/c-Mye and YY1 bind to the upstream region of the CXCR4 promoter , and positively or negatively regulate the CXCR4 promoter , respectively .
Involvement of USF and YY1 at two critical steps of HIV-1 replication , viral fusion/entry and expression , suggests that these transcription factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV disease .
Materials and Methods Plasmids Plasmid pGL-CXCR4 ( -357 ) contains the CXCR4 upstream sequence between -357 and +51 relative to the transcription start site ( TSS ) , followed by the luciferase gene ( 24 ) .
Plasmids pGL-CXCR4AE box and pGL-CXCR4AYY1 were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis ( 26 ) to generate mutations on an E box around -260 and on a YY1 binding site around -300 relative to the TSS , respectively ( see Table I and Fig .
1 ) .
Plasmid pBpuro-c-myc-ER ( a generous gift of T. D. Littlewood , Imperical Cancer Research Fund , London , U.K. ) encodes human c-Myc fused to the hormone-binding domain of the mutant murine estrogen receptor .
Functional expression of a c-Myc fusion protein by the transfected plasmid is induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 10 nM ; Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) ( 27 ) .

Results Identification of putative cis-acting elements in the upstream region of the CXCR4 promoter First , we assessed the binding of cellular transcription factors to the CXCR4 promoter region between -350 and -150 relative to the TSS in DNase I footprinting analysis .
Among areas protected from DNase I digestion ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) , regions around -260 ( FP-5 ) and -300 ( FP-6 ) were found to share homology to an E box ( a binding site for basic region-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper ( bHLHZip ) family proteins ( 35 ) ) and a YY1 binding site ( 8 ) , respectively .
bHLHZip proteins c-Myc , USF-1 , and USF-2 bind to the CXCR4 promoter To demonstrate that the putative E box in the CXCR4 promoter region actually serves as a binding site for bHLHZip family of transcription factors , gel-mobility shift assays were performed using in vitro synthesized proteins .
Either c-Myc/Max , USF-1 , or USE-2 protein formed a complex with an L-E box oligonucleotide corresponding to the FP-5 region ( Fig .
3A ) ; however , c-Myc/Max complex was detectable only after longer exposure ( data not shown ) .
c-Myc protein alone could not form a complex with the L-E box oligonucleotide ( data not shown ) , most likely reflecting the fact that Max protein is an obligate heterodimeric partner for c-Myc ( 35 ) .
When A3.01 CD4 * T cell nuclear extracts were used instead of purified proteins , a DNA-protein complex , which was specifically competed by unlabeled probe as well as by an oligonucleotide containing the consensus E box , was formed ( Fig .
3B ) .
Supershift assays using specific Abs to c-Myc , USF1 , or USF2 indicated that the major complex contained both USF1 and USF2 , but not c-Myc ( Fig .
3C ) .
These results indicate that bHLHZip proteins c-Myc , USF1 , and USF2 bind to the CXCR4 promoter E box ; however , USF1 and USF2 have higher affinity for the E box than does c-Myc .

2 3 4 5 6 1 bHLHZip proteins c-Myc , USF-1 , and USF-2 up-regulate CXCR4 promoter activity To investigate whether bHLHZip proteins c-Myc , USF1 , and USF2 , which can bind to the CXCR4 promoter , are capable of regulating expression from the CXCR4 promoter , expression vectors for these proteins were cotransfected with CXCR4 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs .
Transfection of c-Myc up-regulated expression from the CXCR4 promoter ; this effect was dependent upon the presence of an intact E box ( Fig .
4A ) .
Cotransfection with the Max expression vector did not further enhance c-Myc-medi-ated transactivation of the CXCR4 promoter ( data not shown ) , probably because Max is constitutively and abundantly expressed in most cell types ( 35 , 36 ) .
USF1 , and to a slightly lesser extent , USF2 , also increased expression of the CXCR4 promoter reporter gene .
Mutation of the E box ablated this effect ( Fig .
4B ) .
YY ] binds to the CXCR4 promoter To determine whether YY1 actually binds to the region , gel-mobility shift assays were performed using bacterially synthesized YY1 protein .
Purified YY1 protein formed a complex with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the FP-6 region ( Fig .

A3.01 CD4 * T cell nuclear extracts were found to contain two complexes binding to the FP-6 region , which were specifically competed by unlabeled probe ; a fast migrating complex , but not a slowly migrating complex , was also specifically competed by an oligonucleotide containing the consensus YY1 binding motif ( Fig .
5B ; Table I ) .
Gel-shift interference assays using anti-YY1 Ab confirmed that the fast migrating complex contains YY1 ( Fig .
5C ) .
Thus , these results clearly indicate that YY1 binds to the CXCR4 promoter .
A slowly migrating complex was specifically competed by an oligonucleotide containing the consensus GATA binding motif ( Fig .

Overexpression of YY1 suppressed the CXCR4 promoter in A3.01 cells up to 80 % in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
64 ) .
To determine whether the YY1 binding site on the CXCR4 promoter sequence involves YY1-mediated repression of the CXCR4 promoter , site-directed mutations were introduced on the YY1 binding site , and its activity was compared with that of wild-type promoter .
An oligonucleotide with mutations on the YY1 binding site ( L-YY1-m1 in Table I ) lost its ability to disrupt the YY1 complex formation in gel-mobility shift assays ( Fig .
5B ) .
Introduction of mutations into the CXCR4 promoter/luciferase reporter construct resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in the basal activity ( Fig .
6B ) , and its activity was not markedly influenced by cotransfection with the YY1 expression vector ( Fig .
6A ) .
These results indicate that YY1 inhibits the expression of the CXCR4 promoter through its binding to a site around -300 relative to the TSS .
c-Myc and YY1 mutually inhibit the transregulatory functions on the CXCR4 promoter YY1 has been shown to physically associate with c-Myc , and the interaction between the two proteins appears to result in mutual inhibition of their transregulatory functions ( 37 ) .
To investigate whether these two transcription factors mutually affect their functions related to CXCR4 promoter activity , expression vectors for YY1 and c-Myc were transfected into A3.01 cells individually or in combination along with pGL-CXCR4 ( -357 ) .
As shown above , overexpression of YY1 repressed , while c-Myc transactivated , the CXCR4 promoter activity ; however , the net effect of the cotransfection of both expression vectors on the promoter was negligible ( Fig .
7 ) , implying their mutually inhibitory interaction .
Discussion In this study , we have demonstrated that cellular YY1 transcription factor down-regulates CXCR4 expression through its interaction with the CXCR4 promoter .
Previous studies demonstrated that T cell activation with IL-2 or anti-CD3 Ab increased CXCR4 expression ( 24 , 36 ) , and a cellular transcription factor , NRF-1 , is critical for CXCR4 promoter activity ( 24 ) .
YY1 is the first cellular factor to be identified as a repressor of CXCR4 expression .
YY1 is widely expressed and highly conserved among mammalian species , and thus can be categorized as a ubiquitous transcription factor ( 8 , 30 ) .
YY1 can directly interact with a wide array of cellular and viral proteins and regulates a number of cellular and viral promoters , depending on the gene as well as the cell type in question ( reviewed in Ref .
8 ) .
For example , YY1 has been shown to associate with the c-Myc protein , and this association may lead to mutual inhibition of the transcription functions of both proteins ( 37 ) .
The c-Myc protein is a potent regulator of cell growth and differentiation , and c-Myc expression is down-regulated upon differentiation of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage into more mature phenotypes ( 38 ) .
Considering the relatively weak affinity of c-Myc protein to the CXCR4 promoter E box , we hypothesized that this oncoprotein may activate CXCR4 promoter primarily through the relief of repression mediated by YY1 , as has been reported in other promoter contexts ( 30 ) .
Our hypothesis was supported by the results shown in Fig .
7 .
In contrast to c-Myc , other bHLHZip transcription factors , USF1 and USF2 , which have higher affinity for the CXCR4 promoter E box than does c-Myc and are not known to interact with YY 1 , appear to act through their direct binding to the E box .
Other cellular proteins associated with YY1 include cyclophilin A ( CyPA ) and FK506-binding protein 12 ( 39 ) .
These two proteins specifically interact with YY1 and alter its transcriptional activity , A 120 100 |- > = 80 } O < I @ PA § £ 60 } ' o 3 _I @ 2 ® 40 } 0 oc C wT ® ayyi 20 |-o 1 i 1 1 1 0 1 5 25 ( ug ) pCMV-Y¥1 200 - EBB pGL-CXCR4 ( -357 ) pGL-CXCRaa¥v1 pGL-CXCRA4AE box 150 ; 100 | Relative Luciferase Activity 50 ; 0 FIGURE 6 .

Therefore , it is possible that YY1 influences maturation and uncoating of the HIV-1 virions through interaction with CyPA .
Furthermore , YY1 is one of a few cellular transcription factors known to repress HIV LTR transcription activity ( 9 , 10 ) .
Taken together , YY1 may affect replication of HIV-1 at several different stages : it may inhibit viral fusion/entry through down-regulation of expression of CXCR4 , a fusion/entry cofactor for T-tropic HIV-1 ; it may inhibit uncoating of virions through interaction with CyPA ; and it may inhibit viral expression through down-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activity .
It remains unknown whether the transcription factors investigated in this study can actually modulate cell surface expression of CXCR4 and fusogenic-ity of cells with T-tropic HIV Env ; however , preliminary studies have shown that overexpression of YY1 can markedly decrease cell surface expression of CXCR4 ( D. Margolis , unpublished ob-servation ) .
Thus , it is likely that YY 1-mediated down-regulation of CXCR4 can modulate fusion/entry of T-tropic HIV-1 .
Cellular entry is one of the critical events during the HIV-1 replication cycle .
A recent study demonstrating that levels of expression of CCR5 , a fusion/entry cofactor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 ( 11-13 , 15 , 16 ) , correlate with infectability of CD4 * T cells by macrophage-tropic HIV-1 in vitro ( 42 ) implies that levels of CXCR4 expression may also influence infectability of cells with T-tropic HIV-1 .
In addition , from previous studies demonstrating that SDF-1 , a natural ligand for CXCR4 , inhibits cellular entry of T-tropic HIV-1 ( 19 , 20 ) as well as a recent study showing that a genetic variation in the SDF-1 gene is associated with prognosis of HIV disease ( 43 ) , it is very likely that availability of functional CXCR4 is one of the critical parameters that determine the rate of progression of HIV disease in vivo .
Therefore , it is important to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby expression of HIV fusion/entry cofactors is regulated .
Further char 5991 acterization of the promoter regions for these cofactors will help delineate the molecular mechanisms that control their expression .
