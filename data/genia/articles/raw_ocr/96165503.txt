Kappler , National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine , Denver , CO , September 29 , 1995 ABSTRACT Anergy is a major mechanism to ensure antigen-specific tolerance in T lymphocytes in the adult .
In vivo , anergy has mainly been studied at the cellular level .
In this study , we used the T-cell-activating superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A ( SEA ) to investigate molecular mechanisms of T-lymphocyte anergy in vivo .
Injection of SEA to adult mice activates CD4* T cells expressing certain T-cell receptor ( TCR ) variable region B-chain families and induces strong and rapid production of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) .
In contrast , repeated injections of SEA cause CD4+* T-cell deletion and anergy in the remaining CD4* T cells , characterized by reduced expression of IL-2 at mRNA and protein levels .
We analyzed expression of AP-1 , NF- « B , NF-AT , and octamer binding transcription factors , which are known to be involved in the regulation of IL-2 gene promoter activity .
Large amounts of AP-1 and NF-xB and significant quantities of NF-AT were induced in SEA-activated CD4+* spleen T cells , whereas Oct-1 and Oct-2 DNA binding activity was similar in both resting and activated T cells .
In contrast , anergic CD4+* T cells contained severely reduced levels of AP-1 and Fos /Jun-containing NF-AT complexes but expressed significant amounts of NF- « B and Oct binding proteins after SEA stimulation .
Resolution of the complex demonstrated predominant expression of p50-p65 heterodimers in activated CD4* T cells , while anergic cells mainly expressed the transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer .
These alterations of transcription factors are likely to be responsible for repression of IL-2 in anergic T cells .
Staphylococcal enterotoxins ( SEs ) belong to a family of bacterial proteins denoted as superantigens ( SAgs ) because of their ability to activate a high frequency of both CD4* and CD8 * T cells expressing certain T-cell receptor ( TCR ) variable region B chains ( V ; ) ( 1 , 2 ) .
Administration of SE to adult mice induces rapid production of a panel of cytokines , including interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , and subsequent expansion of reactive T-cell populations ( 3 ) .
After the initial phase of SE-induced activation in vivo , part of the reactive CD4* T cells are deleted and the remaining CD4* T-cell population fails to proliferate and secrete IL-2 in response to a subsequent SE challenge ( 4 ) .
Production of IL-2 in CD4* T cells is strongly regulated at the transcriptional level ( 5 ) .
The IL-2 promoter/enhancer ( 6 ) consists of several DNA response elements , including proximal and distal AP-1 and NF-AT binding sites , NF-IL2A and NF-IL2D that bind octamer proteins , a single NF- « B binding site , and a NF- « B-like CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) , which are all recognized by specific transacting proteins .
Each one of these transcription factors is regulated specifically ( 7 ) and has been shown to contribute significantly to the activity The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

979 of the IL-2 promoter ( 8 ) .
The AP-1 family of proteins includes a number of Fos and Jun proteins ( 9-11 ) .
The Rel family of proteins includes p50 , p65 , and c-Rel proteins , which may bind to the NF- « B element in a variety of protein complexes , such as the highly transcriptionally active p50-p65 heterodimer or the less active p50-p50 homodimer ( 12 , 13 ) .
The Fos/Jun and Rel families of proteins seem to be of major importance in regulating the IL-2 promoter , since they may themselves bind to their AP-1 and NF- « B elements and further participate with other proteins to form an active NF-AT and CD28RE binding complex ( 14 , 15 ) .
Anergy was originally described by Schwartz and co-workers using an in vitro model with T-cell clones , which were rendered anergic by antigen presentation in the absence of appropriate costimulatory signals ( 16 ) .
Studies of these antigen-specific T-cell clones have shown that lack of IL-2 production , a hallmark of anergy , correlates with reduced levels of the AP-1 transcription factor ( 17 ) .
We now demonstrate that in vivo anergized T cells express diminished amounts of AP-1 and NF-AT/AP-1 ( 18 ) binding complexes compared to SAg-activated T cells .
The anergic cells were further shown to retain the ability to mobilize NF- « B .
However , while the induced NF- « B complex in activated T cells was mainly composed of the p50-p65 heterodimer , anergic T cells predominantly contained the p50 homodimer .
This suggests that in vivo anergized CD4* T cells may have a more complex perturbation in IL-2 gene promoter-related transcription factors than was inferred from the in vitro anergy model ( 17 ) .

RESULTS SEA-Induced Anergy Corresponds to Reduced IL-2 Production in Vivo .
In this study , we used TG TCR mice as a sensitive model ( 3 ) to investigate production and transcriptional regulation of IL-2 in SEA-activated and anergic CD4* T cells ( 4 ) .
High serum levels of IL-2 protein were recorded 1-4 hr after SEA priming of TG TCR V ; 3 mice and peak response was seen after 2 hr ( Fig .
14 ) .
However , when the mice were pretreated with two injections of SEA , the response to a subsequent SEA challenge was strongly reduced at all tested time points ( Fig .
14 ) .
RT-PCR analysis revealed that IL-2 mRNA was also decreased after three SEA injections ( Fig .
1 B and C ) .
Different Patterns of Transcription Factors in Activated and Anergic T Cells .

nucleotides encoding AP-1 , NF-kB and octamer consensus motifs , and the distal NF-AT site from the IL-2 promoter .
Spleens were removed 1 hr after the last SEA injection , preceding the peak time point for IL-2 mRNA expression , and nuclear extracts were prepared from purified CD4* spleen cells .
AP-1 binding activity was found to be markedly reduced in anergic CD4* T cells ( 3 % SEA ) compared to activated CD4+* T cells ( 1X SEA ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
Similar results were obtained using the AP-1 consensus sequence or an AP-1 element derived from the murine IL-2 promoter ( 17 ) , although the latter element gave a generally weaker gel shift ( data not shown ) , as reported in earlier studies ( 24 ) .
Extracts from PBS-treated mice contained no AP-1 binding ( Fig .
24 ) .
NF- « B , on the other hand , was induced in both anergic and activated cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
However , the migration pattern differed between the two groups .
Anergic cells expressed mainly a faster-migrating band , while activated cells contained predominantly a slower-migrating band ( Fig .
24 ) .
Incubation of nuclear extracts from anergic , activated , and unstimulated cells with the octamer element showed constitutive expression of two bands , most likely corresponding to Oct-1 and Oct-2 ( Fig .
24 ) .
To investigate the presence of NF-AT binding proteins in vivo , nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified extraction method ( 22 ) .
In the activated cells ( 1 % SEA ) , two complexes were induced ( Fig .
24 ) , indicating the presence of NF-AT alone ( NF-AT , ) and NF-AT/Fos-Jun as described ( 23 ) .

24 ) .
The identity of the NF-AT bands observed in activated cells was further defined by supershift analysis using Abs against NF-AT , ( 20 ) and Fos protein members ( pan-Fos ) .
All NF-AT binding activity was shifted by NF-AT -specific Abs , whereas only the upper band disappeared in the presence of Fos Abs ( Fig .
2B ) , confirming the presence of a NF-AT/AP-1 complex in the activated cells .
No effect was observed with control IgG ( Fig .
2B ) .
This finding was verified by oligonucleotide competition experiments with unlabeled NF-AT , AP-1 , and a nonbinding NF-AT mutant [ M3 ( 23 ) ] .
The NF-AT complexes were blocked by addition of the NF-AT probe but not by the NF-AT M3 mutant ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , the upper but not the lower complex was inhibited by unlabeled AP-1 probe ( data not shown ) .
To analyze the specificity of the shifted AP-1 and NF- « B bands , cross-competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides were performed .
The AP-1 and NF- « B bands were completely blocked with unlabeled AP-1 and NF- « B oligonu-cleotide , respectively , but not with the nonrelevant oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2C ) .
This indicates that the protein-DNA binding is specific and that no cross-reactivity exists between AP-1 and NF- « B binding proteins .
AP-1 and NF- « B Are Rapidly Induced in Vivo .
To exclude the possibility that distinct expression of AP-1 and NF- « B in anergic and activated CD4* T cells reflected a change in kinetics , nuclear extracts were obtained at various time points Fig .

AP-1 activity was found to be induced after 15 min , increased to maximum at 1 hr , and remained detectable up to at least 4 hr after SEA activation ( Fig .

In contrast , AP-1 binding activity was strongly reduced in anergic cells at all time points studied ( Fig .
34 ) .
The upper NF- « B band ( B1 ) was present in activated T cells after 15 min and remained the dominating band up to 4 hr after SEA injection ( Fig .
3B ) .
A minor component of a lower migrating band ( B2 ) was seen in activated cells at 4 hr .
In the anergic cells , the lower band became visible after 15 min and constituted the major band after 1-4 hr ( Fig .

A minor component of the upper band ( B1 ) was indicated at 15 min and 1 hr in anergic T cells ( Fig .

Low Expression of p50-p65 Heterodimers in Anergic CD4+* T Cells .
To identify which components of the Rel family bind as upper or lower bands to the NF- « B element , we used specific Abs to p50 , p65 , and c-Rel .
Supershift analysis revealed that the lower NF- « B band , the main constituent in nuclear extracts of anergic CD4* T cells , was p50-p50 homodimers ( Fig .
4 ) .
The upper band , which is the major NF- « B shift in nuclear extract of activated CD4* T cells , was shown to represent p50-p65 heterodimers , since it was shifted by both p50 and p65 Abs ( Fig .

No c-Rel component was found in either of the extracts ( Fig .

AP-1 Composition Is Not Significantly Altered .
To identify the AP-1 binding components in nuclear extracts of anergic and activated T-helper cells , we performed supershift analyses with antisera to a panel of different Fos and Jun members .
The 1-hr extracts from both anergic and activated CD4* T cells exhibited the same pattern of AP-1 components ( Fig .
5 ) .
c-Fos was shown to constitute the major Fos protein in these extracts , and substantial amounts of JunB and JunD were also present ( Fig .
5 ) .
Addition of antisera against Fra-2 somewhat reduced the bands in activated and anergic cells , indicating participation of this protein in the AP-1 complexes ( Fig .
5 ) .
This was not due to unspecific proteolytic activity , since the antisera did not influence gel shift of an unrelated nuclear factor ( data not CD4+ , 3xSEA CD4+ , 1xSEA .

DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrate that the failure of SAg anergized T-helper cells to produce IL-2 in vivo correlates with perturbed expression of AP-1 , AP-l-containing NF-AT , and NF- « B transcription factors .
Resting CD4* T cells contained low levels of p50-p50 NF- « B homodimer and did not express AP-1 proteins .
In contrast , SEA-activated CD4 * T cells were rapidly induced to express large amounts of p50-p65 NF-kB heterodimers , AP-1 proteins , and the two NF-AT binding complexes .
These data are in accordance with earlier in vitro studies on murine T-cell clones and human peripheral blood T cells ( 25 , 26 ) .
The in vivo induction of NF- « B heterodimer , NF-AT , and AP-1 was extremely rapid compared to earlier in vitro reported characteristics ( 27 ) , implicating a coordinated and very rapid transition from induction of nuclear transcription factors , transcription , translation , and IL-2 secretion in vivo .
A marked decrease of AP-1 binding proteins and a changed migration pattern of the NF-kB binding complex were seen in anergic CD4* T cells at 15 min to at least 4 hr after injection of SEA .
The presence of a faster-migrating octamer binding complex , characterized as Oct-2 by supershift analysis ( data not shown ) , was more pronounced in anergic compared to resting or activated T cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
The changed Oct-1 / Oct-2 ratio might be important since functional differences between these factors have been demonstrated ( 28 ) .
In vitro models of anergy have clearly established an association between repressed IL-2 gene expression and the non-responsive state ( 16 ) .
Recently , Kang et al .
( 17 ) reported diminished levels of AP-1 but normal levels of NF- « B , NF-IL2A ( octamer element ) , and NF-AT in a T-cell clone rendered anergic by TCR stimulation in the absence of costimu-lation ( 17 ) .
The composition of NF- « B proteins was not examined in this study ( 17 ) .
However , transfection of the T-cell clone and reporter gene experiments indicated that an IL-2/ NF- « B promoter was slightly less efficiently driven in the anergic T cells compared to normal T cells ( 17 ) .
Further experiments are required to evaluate the relative importance of NF- « B on the response of in vitro and in vivo anergized T cells , AP-1 and NF- « B transcription factors have been shown to be involved in several important aspects of T-cell development and activation ( 12 , 29 ) .
Mutations in the AP-1 proximal site present in the IL-2 promoter greatly diminished or abolished induction of the IL-2 promoter ( 8 , 24 ) .
In addition , overexpression of c-Fos in transgenic mice accelerated in vitro release of IL-2 by activated T cells ( 30 ) , which underlines the central importance of AP-1 in regulating IL-2 production .
Furthermore , regulatory AP-1 and NF- « B sites have been found in several cytokine gene promoters , including IL-6 and TNF- « ( 31 , 32 ) .
Interestingly , we have shown that TNF production is also down-regulated in SEA anergized CD4* T cells in vivo ( 4 ) .
Supershift analyses of the AP-1 complexes demonstrated that activated T cells expressed substantial amounts of JunB , JunD , and c-Fos and minor amounts of Fra-2 .
Moreover , supershift with pan-Fos family antisera completely abrogated the shift ( data not shown ) , indicating that all AP-1 DNA binding activity is related to Fos-Jun heterodimers , which have a notably higher DNA binding affinity than Jun-Jun homodimers ( 11 ) .
Recently , Rincon and Flavell ( 33 ) demonstrated that mouse T cells activated with anti-CD3 Ab in vitro expressed JunB , c-Jun , Fra-2 , and FosB but not Fra-1 or JunD in the AP-1 complex .
The discrepancy concerning JunD is unclear , but it should be noted that JunD has been reported to be a stronger transcriptional activator than JunB ( 10 ) , suggesting that SAg-activated T cells express Proc .

USA 93 ( 1996 ) 983 a favorable AP-1 composition for driving IL-2 gene expression .
Using TG mice that expressed an AP-1 driven reporter gene , Rincon and Flavell ( 33 ) reported a lack of correlation between AP-1 DNA binding and IL-2 production .
In our studies , however , there was a strong correlation between AP-1 expression and the ability to express IL-2 at the mRNA and protein levels .
Indeed , reduced AP-1 levels were also found in in vitro anergized T cells ( 17 ) .
Whether these discrepancies reflect differences in the response to stimulation in vitro and in vivo or an abnormal regulation of the AP-1 promoter transgene needs to be further addressed .
NF-AT has been demonstrated to be induced in CD4* T-helper 1 clones stimulated through the TCR-CD3 complex and to be required for IL-2 gene induction in these cells ( 18 ) .
Factors binding to the NF-AT motif have previously been reported to consist of two components : NF-AT , , which preexists in the cytosol , and a nuclear AP-1-associated complex , which contains translocated NF-AT , protein ( 18 ) .
We now demonstrate induction of both NF-AT , and NF-AT/AP-1 factors in activated cells , while the anergic cells predominantly expressed the NF-AT , component alone .
These results imply that lack of the NF-AT/AP-1 complex in anergic cells might be secondary to modulation of Fos and Jun proteins .
Interestingly , mutations in the NF-AT site that prevented association of Fos and Jun with NF-AT , abolished the function of this site in activated T cells ( 34 ) , suggesting that the AP-1 component in the NF-AT complex is essential for transcription .
This indicates that down-regulation of NF-AT/AP-1 in anergized T cells further contributes to defective IL-2 production .
In the present study , two different forms of NF- « B were detected in activated and anergic CD4* T cells at time points relevant for IL-2 mRNA and protein production .
Kinetic analysis of the NF-kB response demonstrated that p50-p65 was induced in activated T cells after 5-15 min ( Fig .
3B ; data not shown ) , which most likely reflects release of preformed p50-p65 from I « B inhibitors ( 35 ) .
The presence of p50-p65 after 1-2 hr of activation may reflect de novo synthesized p65 protein .
Anergized CD4* T cells expressed large amounts of p50-p50 homodimers throughout the 4-hr observation period , while activated CD4* T cells expressed the homodimer only after 4 hr of activation in vivo .
The delayed induction of inhibitory p50-p50 protein may represent a normal regulatory feature of IL-2 production , since only low levels of IL-2 mRNA and protein were found at corresponding time points .
In line with this finding , it has been demonstrated in several experimental systems that p50-p50 homodimers lack transcriptional activity and instead occupy cognate NF-kB binding sites and prevent transactivation ( 12 , 13 ) .
A recent study showed a correlation between p50-p50 induction and lack of TNF production during LPS tolerance ( 36 ) .
Taken together , this suggests that the balance between NF-kB p50-p65 heterodimers and pS50-p50 homodimers may be a central mechanism for regulating cytokine production in vivo .
