Tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) is particularly important in this process because of its ability to regulate other inflammatory mediators in an autocrine and paracrine fashion .
The mecha-nism ( s ) responsible for the cell type-specific regulation of TNFa is not known .
We present data to show that the expression of TNFa is regulated by the transcription factor C/EBPRG ( NF-IL6 ) .
activated the TNFa gene promoter in cotransfection assays and bound to it at a site which failed to bind the closely related protein C/EBPa .
Finally , a dominant-negative version of C/EBPB blocked TNFa promoter activation in myeloid cells .
Our results implicate as an important regulator of TNFa by myelomonocytic cells .

Key words : transcription factor « cytokine « promoter « inflammation Introduction Activated macrophages produce an array of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) , interleukins-1 , -6 , and -8 , macrophage chemotactic protein-1 , and macrophage inflammatory protein la ( MIP-la ) ' ( 1-6 ) .
Many of these cytokines are capable of both attraction and activation of additional inflammatory cells and induction of angiogenesis ( 7 ) .
In addition , in chronic inflammation , such as rheumatoid arthritis , macrophages contribute directly to joint destruction by producing proteases , such as collagenase ( matrix metalloproteinase 1 ) and stromelysin ( matrix metalloproteinase 3 ) ( 8 , 9 ) .
TNFa may play a crucial role in the inflammatory process , since it is capable of inducing cytokines and matrix metallopro-teinases in an autocrine and paracrine fashion ( 10 , 11 ) .

The Journal of Clinical Investigation , Inc. Volume 94 , October 1994 , 1449-1455 A variety of stimuli can induce cells to produce TNFa , including infection by viruses or other agents , interaction with adhesion molecules , or treatment with phorbol esters , endotox-ins , or cytokines such as IL-1 or even TNFa itself ( 12-14 ) .
Examination of the upstream promoter region of the human TNFa gene has revealed both cell type- and stimulus-specific regulatory elements , including potential binding sites for the transcription factors NF- « B and AP-1 ( 15-22 ) .
Although many cell types including lymphocytes , smooth muscle cells , mast cells , and others are capable of TNFa synthesis , activated mono-cytes/macrophages are the principal source of TNFa ( 12 ) .
Nonetheless , little is known about how the TNFa gene is regulated in a cell type-specific fashion .
C/EBPS ( CCAAT/enhancer binding protein 3 , also called NF-IL6 , NF-M , LAP , IL6-DBP , AGP/EBP , and CRP2 ) is a member of a family of transcription factors termed bZip proteins which have a basic DNA-binding domain linked to a leucine zipper dimerization motif .
It is closely related to the founding member of this family , C/EBPa , which has been shown to be intimately involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation ( 23 ) .
Earlier studies identified monocytes and macrophages as the principal source of ( 24 , 25 ) .
Cell type-specific gene regulation by C/EBPS has been shown to depend on interactions with other transcription factors , such as NF-kB , c-jun , the glucocorticoid receptor , and the nuclear oncoprotein v-Myb ( 26-29 ) .
In addition , binding sites for have been identified in the promoters for a large number of cytokine genes which are expressed in myeloid cells , including the genes for interleukins-1 , -6 , and -8 , MIP-la , and chicken monocyte growth factor ( cMGF ) ( 24 , 30-35 ) , suggesting that the factor may be an important activator of inflammation and of growth regulatory genes .
Finally , ectopic expression of Myb and C/ has been shown to induce the expression of myeloid-specific genes in heterologous cell types , implicating C/EBPS as a key regulator of myeloid cell differentiation ( 27 ) .
In this paper , we have investigated the relationship between C/EBP } activity and TNFa expression .
We identified a specific binding site for in the TNFa gene promoter , suggesting that C/EBP directly regulates the expression of the cytokine .
We tested this in cotransfection assays and found that C/EBP/3 , more strongly than C/EBPa , activated a TNFa promoter-reporter construct .
Furthermore , ectopic expression of a dominant-negative form of C/EBPA was able to block activation of the TNFa promoter by endogenous transcription factors .
Our results demonstrate that C/EBP/ is an important regulator of the TNFa gene and that it is responsible for the cell type-specific regulation of the TNFa gene in myelomonocytic cells .
Methods Cell lines .
The human myelomonocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1 and the Jurkat human T cell line were obtained from the American Type C/EBP { 3 Regulates Tumor Necrosis Factor a Expression 1449 Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) and were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum , glutamine , penicillin , and streptomycin .
HD-11 , an MC29 virus ( v-myc onco-gene ) transformed chicken macrophage cell line , was maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium supplemented with 8 % fetal bovine serum , 3 % chicken serum , glutamine , and antibiotics as above .
Plasmids .
The human expression vector which expresses the NF-IL6 cDNA under control of the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter ( from S. Akira , Osaka University , Japan ) , has been described ( 24 ) , as have similar plasmids that express full-length chicken C/EBPS ( cC/EBP # , also referred to as NF-M ) and the 5D229 dominant-negative deletion mutant ( 27 , 31 ) .
The latter plasmid expresses a protein having an NH ; -terminal deletion so that only the last 229 amino acids remain .
This protein is 92 % identical and 99 % homologous to its human counterpart , and the COOH-terminal 212 amino acids , representing the DNA binding and leucine zipper domains , are 99 % identical .
The TNFa promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids have been described ( 15 , 22 ) .
The pCDM8 expression vector plasmid was purchased from Invitrogen ( San Diego , CA ) .
Transfections and reporter gene assays .
Jurkat T cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran as follows .
On the day before transfec-tion , the cells were split to ~ 0.7 x 10° cells/ml .
For each sample , ~ 1 X 10° cells were washed twice , then resuspended in 2 ml STBS ( 25 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7.5 , 137 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCI , 0.6 mM Na , PO , , 0.7 mM CaCl ; , and 0.5 mM MgCl ) ; ) containing 750 pg/ml DEAE-dextran and a total of 15 ug of CsCl-purified plasmid DNA ( specific plus carrier ) , for 30 min at 37°C , with gentle inversion every 5 min .
The cells were then collected by centrifugation , resuspended in fresh medium , and allowed to recover for 3-5 h before treatment with 20 ng/ml PMA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) as indicated .
Cells were harvested 18-24 h later .
The U937 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously ( 15 ) , using an electroporation apparatus from Invitrogen .
DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection of HD-11 cells and luciferase assays have been described ( 27 , 31 ) .
All transfection results were normalized for protein content , as determined using an assay reagent from Bio-Rad Laboratories ( Richmond , CA ) .
All experiments were performed a minimum of three times , and similar results were obtained using independent preparations of DNA .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) .
Nuclear extracts were obtained from U937 , THP-1 , and Jurkat cells as described ( 36 ) .
All buffers were supplemented with PMSF ( 20 ug/pl ) , aprotinin , pep-statin A , and leupeptin ( each 5 pg/ml ) .
For expression in insect cells , the cC/EBP3 CDNA was transferred to the transfer vector pVL1392 and transfected into Sf9 cells along with linearized Baculovirus DNA using a kit from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) .
The resulting virus was used to infect new Sf9 or High-5 cells , and nuclear extracts were prepared 2 d later as follows .
All buffers were chilled and supplemented with protease inhibitors as described above .
The cells were collected , washed twice with PBS , and resuspended in Tris-X buffer ( 20 mM Tris-Cl , pH 7.3 , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM EDTA , 1.5 mM MgCl , , and 0.5 mM CaCl ; ) at a concentration of 1 x 10'/ml .
The cells were lysed by adding NP-40 to a final concentration of 0.5 % , then the nuclei were recovered by centrifugation , resuspended at fourfold higher concentration of Tris- X buffer plus 0.3 M KCl , left 5 min on ice , and then centrifuged again .
The supernatant was diluted with three volumes of Tris-X buffer ( to make 0.085 M KCl final ) , and centrifuged again , and the resulting nuclear extract was stored at -80°C .
Bacterially expressed , purified rat C/EBP ( rC/EBP/3 ) and rat C/EBPa ( rC/EBPa ) proteins were generously provided by P. Johnson ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) .
Bacterially expressed human NF- « B1 ( p50 ) was purchased from Promega Corp. ( Madison , WI ) .
The methods for radiolabeling the double-stranded oligonucleotide probes using Klenow polymerase and [ a- `` P ] dCTP and for performing the EMSAs have been described ( 27 ) .
Where indicated , antibodies or excess unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were incubated with the proteins or nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice before the addition of the probe .
The samples were then incubated for an additional 20 min before electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .
Antibodies spe- 1450 _ R. M. Pope , A. Leutz , and S. A. Ness cific for cC/EBP/3 , and were obtained from S. Akira , A. Leutz , and P. Johnson , respectively .
Synthetic oligonucleotides .
The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used to generate the -130/+35 TNFa radiolabeled EMSA probe using the polymerase chain reaction : forward , 5-GGCCCACTACCG- '' ; reverse , 5-CCTCTGCTGTCCTTGCTGA-3 ' .
The following radiolabeled oligonucleotides were used as probes in EMSAs : the -100/-74 C/EBPG binding site of the TNFa promoter , 5'-TCG-ACATGGGTTTCTCCACCAAGGAAGTTTTC-3 ' , 3'-GTACCCAA-AGAGGTGGTTCCTTCAAAAGAGCT-5 ' , the binding sequence from the IL-6 promoter ( 24 ) , 5'-TCGAGACATTGCACA-ATCTG-3 ' , 3'-CTGTAACGTCTTAGACAGCT-5 ' , and the Ig/HIV promoter binding sequence for NF-kB ( 37 ) , 5'-TCGAGAAGGGAC-TTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGC-3 ' , 3'-CTTCCCTGAAAGG-CGACCCCTGAAAGGTCCCGAGCT-5 ' .
DNasel footprinting .
The -615 TNFa-luciferase plasmid was digested with Xhol , radiolabeled by end-filling using Klenow polymerase and { a- P ] dCTP , and then further digested with HindIH .
The resulting fragment containing the TNFa promoter was purified after agarose gel electrophoresis using Geneclean ( Bio101 ) and subjected to DNasel footprinting as described ( 38 ) .
Results C/EBPG activates the TNFa promoter .
The TNFa promoter has been shown to be strongly activated by treatment with PMA ( 15 , 22 ) , an activator of protein kinase C which also activates activity ( 31 , 39 ) .
We used transient transfection assays to determine whether C/EBPS could cooperate with PMA treatment to activate the TNFa promoter .
We chose the Jurkat human T cell line , which normally does not express either C/EBPS3 or TNFa , under the conditions used in our assays ( data not shown ) .
A series of TNFa promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs , containing portions of the promoter extending from just downstream to several hundred nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site ( 22 ) , were transfected into Jurkat cells either with a control plasmid or with a plasmid expressing under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter .
Parallel experiments were performed with and without PMA treatment .
As shown in Fig .
1 , none of the TNFa promoter constructs were expressed at significant levels in the absence of PMA treatment , even in the presence of hC/EBP/3 , and none were significantly activated by PMA treatment alone .
However , PMA treatment of cells expressing led to strong activation of all but the shortest promoter constructs tested ( -36 bp from the transcription start site ) , suggesting that PMA and C/EBP/3 acted cooperatively to induce TNFa promoter activity .
In addition , the data suggest that crucial PMA- and C/EBP /3-responsive elements must lie in the region bounded by positions -95 and -36 in the TNFa promoter .
The promoter construct extending only to position -95 was consistently less active than the longer versions ( -120 and -295 ) , suggesting that an important regulatory element ( s ) might lie near the -95 site in the promoter .
C/EBPG binds a specific site in the TNFa promoter .
The experiments described above suggested that could regulate the TNFa promoter .
An EMSA was used to determine whether the promoter contained a bona fide C/EBPS binding site .
Based on our results with the promoter-reporter gene constructs ( see above ) , we generated a radiolabeled fragment of the TNFa promoter bounded by positions - 130 to +35 relative to the transcription start site .
Fig .

Transfections of Jurkat T cells were performed as described in Methods , using 0.5 ug of the hC/EBPS3 plasmid and 3 ug of the indicated TNFa promoter reporter construct .

Similar complexes were also formed using nuclear extracts from the human myeloid cell line THP-1 ( not shown ) .
These results suggest that C/EBPS could play a direct role in the regulation of the TNFa promoter .
A DNaselI footprint assay was used to more precisely localize the binding sites for C/EBP/ on the TNFa promoter .
However , as shown in Fig .
2 B , the addition of THP-1 nuclear extracts to an end-labeled fragment of the TNFa promoter resulted in the formation of a new DNaselI hypersensitive site at position -90 relative to the start site of transcription , rather than a discrete protected region .
These results suggest that the extracts contained a protein or complex that specifically interacted with this region of the promoter .
Addition of antibodies specific for hC/EBP/3 , but not nonimmune serum , blocked the hypersensitive site formation , indicating that C/EBP/3 , or a protein complex containing was responsible for this change in the DNasel sensitivity of the promoter .
Two potential C/EBP/ { 3-binding sites , in opposite orienta-tions , were noted extending from -97 to -79 bp relative to the transcription start site of the TNFa promoter , which conformed at 9 of 12 positions to the consensus C/EBP/3-binding site , T ( T/ G ) NNGNAA ( T/G ) ( 24 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 , insect cell-expressed S3 protein bound efficiently to a radiolabeled , synthetic 26-mer oligonucleotide containing this site .
Again , C/ EBPA binding was inhibited completely when an excess of either unlabeled oligonucleotide used as the probe or one containing a previously identified C/EBPA-binding site from the human IL-6 gene promoter was included .
The complex was not inhibited by an unlabeled NF- « B binding oligonucleotide representing the Ig/HIV promoter ( not shown ) , even though the oligonucleotide used as the probe contained a previously characterized binding site for NF- « B ( data not shown ; 17 ) .
Addition of antibodies specific for cC/EBP/3 , but not control antibodies , resulted in a supershift of the protein-DNA com-plex .
Similar results have also been obtained using recombinant , purified rat C/EBPS ( rC/EBP3 ) ( Fig .
4 A ; data not shown ) .
Although C/EBP/3 bound quite efficiently to the TNFa pro-moter-derived binding site , the oligonucleotide derived from the IL-6 promoter was a better competitor when the -100/-74 TNFa oligonucleotide was used as probe , suggesting that the binding site in the TNFa promoter was relatively weak .

Selectivity of binding to -100/-74 TNFa oligonucleotide .
and C/EBPa are both expressed in macrophage cell lines and are capable of heterodimerization and of binding to the same oligonucleotides ( 40-42 ) .
We next examined the ability of C/EBPa and C/EBP to interact differently with the TNFa promoter .
Using an EMSA , purified recombinant C/ EBP/ # and C/EBPa both bound strongly to the oligonucleotide derived from the IL-6 promoter ( Fig .
4 A ) .
Binding by both isoforms to the IL-6 probe was inhibited by excess unlabeled IL-6 , but not TNFa , promoter oligonucleotide .
Similar results have been observed previously with oligonucleotides derived from the cMGF promoter ( 31 , 43 ) .
In contrast , only C/EBPS bound to the -100/-74 TNFa oligonucleotide , suggesting that the site was specific for only one member of this highly related family of bZip proteins ( Fig .
4 A ) .
A cotransfection assay was used to test whether both bZip proteins could activate the TNFa promoter .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with TNFa or cMGF promoter-reporter constructs , plus either C/EBPS3 or C/EBPa expression vectors .
Transfected cells were then treated with PMA .
Both transcription factors activated the cMGF promoter to approximately equal levels ( Fig .
4 B ) .
In contrast , C/EBPS was a stronger activator of the TNFa promoter than C/EBPa , consistent with its stronger binding in the EMSA .
When C/EBPa was coex-pressed with C/EBP/3 , the activation of the TNFa promoter was comparable with that observed with C/EBP alone , suggesting either that C/EBPa// # heterodimers were as active as C/EBPS homodimers or that was somehow dominant .
Dominant-negative C/EBPG inhibits the TNFa promoter .
Overexpression of could affect the regulation of the TNFa promoter in two ways , either by binding to the promoter 1452 - R. M. Pope , A. Leutz , and S. A. Ness and directly activating its transcription or by interfering with negative-regulatory effects of other bZip proteins such as C/ EBPa , perhaps by forming inactive heterodimers ( 42 ) .
This was tested using a truncated , dominant-negative ( DN ) version of the chick C/EBP/3 protein ( 27 , 31 ) , termed DN229 .
This version of C/EBP/ only contains the COOH-terminal 229-most amino acids .
It therefore lacks the transactivation domain , leaving the dimerization and DNA-binding domains intact .
It is capable of binding DNA , but has no transactivation activity , and forms inactive heterodimers with other C/EBP -like proteins ( 31 ) .
The DN229 construct has been shown to be quite effective at suppressing the expression of other C/EBP # -regulated genes , such as the cMGF and mim-1 genes ( 27 , 31 ) .
When compared with control expression vectors without an insert , cotransfection of the DN229 plasmid was quite effective at inhibiting the ability of hC/EBPS to activate the TNFa promoter in Jurkat cells , even though the cells were treated with PMA ( Fig .
5 ) .
This indicates that the DN229 construct is not only unable to activate the TNFa promoter , but that expression of a truncated form of C/EBP blocks activation by the full-length protein .
A similar experiment was performed using the human mye-lomonocyte cell line U937 , which expresses endogenous C/ EBP/3 protein and secretes a high concentration of TNFa in response to PMA ( data not shown ) to determine whether ectopi-cally expressed DN229 could likewise block the expression of the TNFa promoter in myeloid cells .
Fig .
6 shows that the TNFa promoter construct extending to position -120 , the construct that consistently provided the greatest activation , was moderately active when transfected into U937 cells and that its expression was stimulated three- to fivefold when the cells were treated with PMA .
( Similar results were obtained with other myeloid cell lines , including human THP-1 and chicken HD-11 cells . )
Expression of the dominant-negative form of C/EBP3 ( DN229 ) not only blocked activation by PMA , but also inhibited TNFa promoter activity to below basal levels .
In contrast , the control plasmid containing only the CMV promoter had no effect on the activity of the TNFa promoter-reporter gene construct .
We conclude that the human TNFa promoter is directly regulated by C/EBP/ # 3 , most probably by binding to the region between -95 and -36 relative to the transcription start Site .
Discussion Activation of TNFa has been implicated in a wide variety of responses to inflammatory and infectious agents , and it is known to be highly expressed by activated macrophages , such as those found in the synovial lining of rheumatoid joints ( 44 , 45 ) .
The results in this paper demonstrate that the transcription factor C/ EBP # is a key regulator of the TNFa gene .
We have identified a specific site in the TNFa promoter , shown that the promoter responds dramatically to the expression of C/ EBP } , and used a dominant-negative version of C/EBP # to inhibit the activation of the TNFa promoter .
The C/EBP/3-binding site identified by DNasel footprinting and EMSA experiments maps to positions ~100/-74 of the human TNFa promoter .
However , compared with the oligonucleotide from the IL-6 promoter , C/EBP # bound the -100/ -74 site relatively weakly .
Nevertheless , in DNasel footprinting assays , which are generally much less sensitive than EMSAs , myeloid cell extracts induced the formation of a DNasel hypersensitive site on the TNFa promoter at position -90 , A Lane : _1 2 3 4 5° °~6 7 8 9 C/EBPB + + = = _.® =~ + + + C/EBPa = = .+ $ $ o $ % ' - ® Probe : TNF TNF TNF IL6 IL6 IL6 IL6 IL6 IL6 Competitor : C C C C IL6 TNF C TNF IL6 Sera : N 1 = & HET ] NL ei C/EBPo u C/EBPB N UJ 1007 Promoter Activation ( Fold Increase ) Free TNFa-luc + C/EBPB TNFa-uc + Both TNFoAuc + C/EBPa 0.5 1 1.5 2 C/EBP Expression Vector ( ug transfected ) Figure 4 .
The TNFa promoter is specific for C/EBP .
( A ) Selective binding of C/EBP , but not C/EBPa , to the -100/-74 TNFa promoter .
The EMSA was performed with recombinant , purified rC/EBPa ( lanes 3-6 ) and rC/EBPS ( lanes 1 , 2 , and 7-9 ) , as indicated at the top of the figure .
The radiolabeled probes , which included the C/EBP -binding site of the IL-6 promoter ( IL-6 ) and the -100/-74 TNFa promoter ( TNF ) oligonucleotides , and the competitor oligonucleotides , used at 100-fold excess , are also indicated at the top of the figure ( symbols as in Fig .

Nonimmune ( N ) or monospecific , immune anti-rC/EBPS ( 7 ) sera were added where indicated .
The mobilities of the C/EBPa and C/EBP/3 bound and the free , unbound radiolabeled -100/-74 TNFa oligonucleotide are indicated on the left of the figure .
( B ) C/EBP/3 preferentially activates the TNFa promoter .
Jurkat cells were transfected as described in Methods .
They were cotransfected with the TNFo-luciferase ( 3 ug ) or with cMGF-luciferase ( 4.5 ug ) constructs and with the hC/EBPS or the rC/EBPa expression vectors in the concentrations indicated at the bottom of the figure .
Where indicated , both C/EBPa and C/EBP # 3 were cotransfected at equal concentrations .
The fold increase represents the fold increase over baseline induced by PMA .
These experiments were repeated twice with similar results .
and this activity was inhibited by antisera .
Thus , in the context of a nuclear extract , the C/EBP/3 appears to interact with a relatively high affinity for the promoter , suggesting that the factor may be part of a multiprotein complex which binds the TNFa promoter in myeloid cells .
The TNFa promoter was differentially recognized by C/ EBP } and C/EBPa .
Purified recombinant C/EBP/ , but not C/ EBPa , bound to the TNFa promoter oligonucleotide in EMSA assays .
Consistent with this difference , C/EBP/3 was considerably more active than C/EBPa at activating the TNFa promoter construct .
As a control , the cMGF promoter , which readily binds both C/EBP proteins , was activated equally well by each .
Both C/EBPa and are expressed in myelomonocytic cell lines , however , C/EBPa decreased while increased with differentiation and activation ( 40 , 41 ) .
These data suggest that the differential binding of the two transcription factors may be important in the regulation of TNFa in monocytes/ macrophages where both bZip proteins are expressed .
The importance of the region of the TNFa promoter that contains the C/EBP/3-binding site ( at position -90 ) has also been noted by others .
For example , three copies of a 43-nucleo-tide-long fragment of the promoter spanning this site was suffi- cient to confer both elevated basal and TNFa-inducible activity to an otherwise minimally active heterologous promoter ( 21 ) .
More recently , a cyclosporin A- and FK506-sensitive factor in the murine T cell line Ar-5 was identified that functions through a portion of the promoter overlapping the C/EBP/3-binding site ( 17 ) .
Of interest , the -90 site is adjacent to a potential binding site for NF- « B ( 17 , 24 ) , which has been shown to interact with C/EBPS $ in vitro ( 26 , 29 ) .
In addition , both C/EBP/3 and NF-kB bound to the IL-6 and the IL-8 gene promoters , and the ratio of the two factors appeared to regulate the activities of those genes ( 34 , 46 ) .
Our own preliminary data suggest that overexpression of NF- « BI1 or RelA may inhibit C/EBP ated activation of the TNFa promoter in Jurkat cells ( Pope , R. , and S. A. Ness , unpublished observations ) .
Further work will be required to determine whether these two transcription factors interact to regulate the TNFa gene .
An interesting feature of TNFa gene regulation in Jurkat cells was its apparent dependence on both C/EBP/3 and PMA treatment , which presumably participates by stimulating protein kinase C. PMA treatment has been shown to lead to phosphorylation of C/EBP , induce its translocation to the nucleus , and enhance its ability to stimulate transcription ( 31 , 39 ) , sug- C/EBP { 3 Regulates Tumor Necrosis Factor a Expression 1453 \ -- C- -95 TNF & u 2s1 3 , -- O -- - 120 TNFa U A -A- -295 TNFa Percent Inhibition of TNF Activation 507 757 1m I t I I 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 Dominant Negative C/EBPB ( ug plasmid transfected ) Figure 5 .

Relative light units were corrected for the total protein in the cell lysates .
Percent suppression was determined by comparison with the control vector .
These experiments were repeated three times with similar results .
gesting that PMA treatment may be required simply to convert the over-expressed to a more active form .
Alterna-tively , PMA may activate other transcription factors which cooperate with C/EBP/3 , such as NF- « B or c-jun ( 47 , 48 ) .
Several potential PMA-responsive elements have been identified in the TNFa promoter , including binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 and AP-2 located at positions -63 and -34 , respectively ( 22 ) .
Cotransfection with c-jun enhanced and mutation of the AP-1-binding site diminished TNFa gene expres-sion , supporting the importance of the AP-1 site ( 22 ) .
Whether or not interaction between and c-jun is important in Control Control + PMA Vector + PMA DN229 + PMA F T T T 1 0 10 20 30 40 Figure 6 .
PMA-induced TNFa promoter activation in U937 cells is inhibited by DN C/EBP/3 .
The transfections were performed by electroporation as described in Methods , using 5 ug of the - 120 TNFa reporter construct , and 0.5 ug of the DN C/EBP ( DN229 ) or vector ( pCDM # 8 ) .
Relative light units were corrected for the total protein in the cell lysates .
These experiments were repeated four times with similar results .
1454 R. M. Pope , A. Leutz , and S. A. Ness TNFa activation ( 49 ) , and whether the TNFa gene can be activated in the absence of C/EBP/3 , for example in other cell types that do not express the factor , remains to be determined .
In addition to TNFa , a number of other cytokine genes , such as IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , and MIP-1a also possess functional C/EBP/ { 3-binding sites in their promoters ( 24 , 30 , 32-35 ) .
Many of these are considered important mediators of inflammation and are produced in response to TNFa ( 3-6 ) .
The expression of C/EBPS may be important in chronic inflammation associated with a variety of disorders .
The inhibition of C/ activity , perhaps mediated by ectopic expression of a dominant-negative form of the protein , presents a potential means of blocking the synthesis of cytokines like TNFa which contribute to chronic inflammation .
Further work with dominant-negative forms of will be required to determine if such therapy is possible .
