We have previously shown that protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation ( with phorbol ester ( PMA ) alone ) specifically induces differentiation of primary human CD34+* hemopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) to mature DC .
We now find that cytokine-driven ( granulocyte-macrophage CSF and TNF-a ) CD34¢* HPC-DC differentiation is preferentially blocked by inhibitors of PKC activation .

The CD34~* myelomonocytic cell line KG1 differentiates into dendritic-like cells in response to granulocyte-macrophage CSF plus TNF-a , or PMA ( with or without the calcium ionophore ionomycin , or TNF-a ) , with different stimuli mediating different aspects of the process .
Phenotypic DC characteristics of KG1 dendritic-like cells include morphology ( loosely adherent cells with long neurite processes ) , MHC I+/MHC +/ CD14~ surface Ag expression , and RelB and DC-CK1 gene expression .
Functional DC characteristics include fluid phase macromolecule uptake ( FITC-dextran ) and activation of resting T cells .
Comparison of KG1 to the PMA-unresponsive subline KG1la reveals differences in expression of TNF receptors 1 and 2 ; PKC isoforms a , BI , BII , and p ; and RelB , suggesting that these components/pathways are important for DC differentiation .

B cells ( 1 ) .
In humans , dendritic cells are a heterogeneous population shown in vitro to arise from multiple distinct hemopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) along distinct differentiation pathways .
These progenitors include CD14* monocytes ( 2-5 ) and CD34 * bone marrow cells ( in humans a heterogeneous population of multipotential progenitors of which the true pluripotent stem cell is a subset ) .
CD34 `` CD10 + HPC give rise to the lymphoid DC lineage ( 6 ) , whereas CD34 `` CD86 *~ HPC are progenitors for myeloid DC and monocyte/macrophages ( 7 ) .
Broadly characterized from a cellular standpoint , there are two stages of DC differentiation ( 8 ) .
The first stage involves differentiation of multipotential HPC to immature ( or unactivated ) DC , cells with high capacity for Ag uptake but relatively poor ability to activate T cells .
This differentiation is induced in vitro by exogenous cytokines ( GM-CSF and TNF- @ ( with or without other cytokines ) for CD34 * HPC ( 9 ) , and GM-CSF and IL-4 for monocytes ( 2-5 ) ) , CD40 receptor cross-linking ( CD34* HPC ) ( 10 ) , or calcium ionophore alone ( monocytes ) ( 11 ) .
The second stage involves maturation of immature to mature DC , cells that have decreased Ag uptake capability but are much more potent in activating T cells .
An alternative viewpoint is that DC maturation is actually activation of resting DC .
In vivo this second stage is probably triggered by `` danger signals , '' which may include live bacteria and components ( LPS , DNA ) , viral infection , and inflammatory cytokines ( reviewed in Ref .
1 ) .
In vitro , maturation/activation can be induced by a number of stimuli , including cytokines ( TNF-a with or without other cytokines , reviewed in Ref .
12 ) , monocyte-conditioned medium ( 13 ) , or CD40 receptor cross-linking ( 10 ) .
0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3238 We have previously reported that the phorbol ester PMA alone induces differentiation of human CD34 HPC into mature and fully functional DC , suggesting that direct activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) by itself is sufficient to trigger this lineage commitment ( 14 ) .
PMA-driven CD34* HPC-DC differentiation is specific for DC ( no other lineages are generated ) and does not involve proliferation ( differentiation is complete within 7 days ) , although about 50 % of the input number of CD34 * HPC are lost ( in part via apoptosis ) .
All these characteristics distinguish PMA from receptor-mediated differentiation signals ( cytokines , CD40 receptor cross-linking ) .
Since exogenous stimuli ( including TNF- « , IL-1B , IL-4 , and CD40 ) ( 15-19 ) used to induce CD34 *HPC-DC differentiation also activate PKC as part of their downstream signaling cascade , it is likely that PMA is activating the component of this cascade that specifically initiates DC differentiation .
Consistent with this , we now report that inhibition of PKC activation suppresses generation of DC by GM-CSF and TNF-a @ stimulation of CD34 HPC .
Aside from a potential role for PKC activation , relatively little is known about what intracellular signaling pathways ( and the genetic programs they initiate ) are involved in HPC-DC differentiation .
Signaling via intracellular calcium flux alone ( by calcium ionophore ) induces monocyte- > DC differentiation ( 11 ) , although we have not observed this for CD34* HPC ( D.C.S.L and K.P.L , unpublished observations ) .
The downstream components involved in this calcium signaling are uncharacterized .
Another signaling pathway involves the lipid second messenger ceramide , which mediates down-regulation of Ag uptake during cytokine-driven maturation/activation of DC ( 20 ) .
Downstream of these signaling path-ways , the transcription factor RelB ( a member of the NFkB family ) appears to play an important role in DC differentiation based on apparent function ( 21-24 ) and the phenotype of RelB knockout mice ( 25 , 26 ) .
ReIB expression is up-regulated in vitro during cytokine- or PMA-driven DC differentiation ( 2 , 14 ) .
What genes RelB specifically regulates during DC differentiation is currently unknown .
Even using agents that directly activate signal transduction path-ways , a number of obstacles makes study of the intracellular and genetic events involved in DC differentiation difficult .
The rarity of CD34 * HPC ( 0.1-1 % of bone marrow mononuclear cells ) makes sufficient isolation for larger scale studies laborious .
In addition , CD34+* HPC are a heterogeneous population of progenitors already committed to different lineages ( for example , see Ref .
6 ) , which makes analysis of bulk starting populations problematic .
Receptor-mediated CD34 * HPC-DC differentiation involves cell proliferation , which complicates identification of differentiation-specific processes .
These stimuli also generate mixed populations of cells ( DC , monocytes , neutrophils ) that require additional purification of DC before definitive analysis ( reviewed in Ref .
12 ) .
Finally , CD34 * HPC have traditionally been difficult to transfect/ transduce ( 27 ) , making genetic manipulation involving these approaches less effective .
Many of these problems could be circumvented in a cell line model of DC differentiation .
Czerniecki et al .
have suggested that the pro-myelocytic HL-60 cell line differentiates into DC with calcium iono-phore , thus representing a potential model of monocyte- > DC differentiation ( 11 ) .
It has recently been reported that committed CD34 * precursors for myeloid DC and macrophages are CD86 positive ( 7 ) .
We have found that the CD34* human myeloblastic cell line KG1 ( 28 ) also expresses CD86 .
KG1 is a cytokine-responsive human CD34 * myelomonocytic cell line derived from a patient with eryth-roleukemia .
KG1 was originally described to differentiate to the monocyte/macrophage lineage ( based on morphologic and histochemical assays ) when stimulated with phorbol ester ( 29-31 ) , A CELL LINE MODEL OF HUMAN DENDRITIC CELL DIFFERENTIATION although DC-specific markers were not available at that time .
The KG1a subline of KG1 was indifferent to the effects of PMA ( and cytokines ) and is characterized as less differentiated than KG1 ( 29 , 30 , 32 ) .
KG1 and KG1a have qualitative differences in PKC activation and substrate phosphorylation ( 30 , 33 , 34 ) .
We now report that phorbol ester or cytokine ( GM-CSF and TNF-a ) induces KG1 to differentiate into dendritic-like cells ( DLC ) based on morphology , surface Ag phenotype , function , and gene expression .
In contrast , KG1a do not differentiate .
Characterization of stimuli required to induce DLC differentiation as well as comparison to KG1a provide evidence that distinct intracellular signaling pathways are involved and mediate specific components of differentiation .
Materials and Methods Cells and culture CD34* HPC were isolated from organ donor bone marrow by immuno-magnetic selection as previously described ( 35 ) .
Purified cells were typically > 95 % CD34* as determined by FACS analysis with a second non-cross-blocked anti-CD34 mAb .
For generation of DC , CD34* HPC were cultured for 14 days at 5 X 10* cells/ml in complete culture medium ( IMDM , Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS ( HyClone , Logan UT ) , 100 mM 1-glutamine , and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin solution ( Life Technologies ) ) with GM-CSF ( 200 U/ml ! )
and TNF-a ( 2.5 ng/ml ; all from R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
Where indicated , staurosporine ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) was added at 0.1 ng/ml , a dose sufficient to block PMA-induced proliferation of human T cells .
At the end of the culture period , nonadherent cells and adherent cells were resuspended ( 3 mM EDTA ) , washed , and concentrated by centrifugation .
KG1 and KG1a cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) and cultured in IMDM/20 % FCS/100 mM L-glutamine/100 U penicillin/streptomycin at 5 X 10 '' cells/ml .
Cultures were stimulated alone or in combination with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ; Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) , GM-CSF ( 200 U/ml ) , TNF-a ( 10 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( 100 ng/ml ; Calbiochem ) .
The four-cytokine combination of GM-CSF ( 2 ng/ ml ) , IL-3 ( 5 ng/ml ) , IL-6 ( 5 ng/ml ) , stem cell factor ( SCF ; 120 ng/m ! )
has previously been found to induce robust proliferation of primary CD34 * HPC ( 35 ) .
Where indicated , bisindolylmaleimide I ( bis ; Calbiochem ) was used at 5 M. Flow cytometric analysis and mAbs Adherent and loosely adherent cells were harvested with 3 mM EDTA , washed twice , and resuspended in staining medium ( PBS , 5 % FCS , 2 % BSA , and 0.1 % sodium azide ) .
Phenotypic analysis of cells ( 2 X 10° ) was performed by flow cytometry using saturating concentrations of the following mAbs : CD1a ( clone SK9 ) , CD2 ( $ 5.2 ) , CD4 ( SK3 ) , CD13 ( L138 ) , CD14 ( MOP9 ) , CD34 ( 8G12 ) , CD80 ( L307.4 ) , and CD154 ( 89-76 ; all from Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) ; CD10 ( HI10A ) , CD33 ( WM53 ) , CD40 ( 5C3 ) , CD45RA ( HI100 ) , CD86 ( IT2.2 ) , and CD90 ( 5E10 ; all from PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) ; CD83 ( HB15 , Immunotech , Westbrook , ME ) ; MHC class I ( H58A ) and MHC class II ( H42A , both from Veterinary Medical Research Development , Pullman , WA ) ; ¢-fms ( 3-4A4 ) , TNF receptor 1 ( N-20 ) , and TNF receptor 2 ( C-20 ; all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Appropriate conjugated isotype-matched Abs were used as controls .
Ten thousand cells were analyzed on a Coulter Elite flow cytometer ( Coulter , Hialeah , FL ) through a viable cell gate as determined by forward and right angle light scatter parameters to exclude sub-cellular particles .
Apoptotic cells were identified by annexin V staining as previously described ( 36 ) .
Briefly , cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in a binding buffer ( from the manufacturer ) containing HEPES with 2.5 mM CaCl ; at a concentration of 1 X 10 % /ml .
One hundred mi-croliters of this suspension was reacted with 10 gl of annexin V-FITC ( 10 ug/tal ( R & D Systems ) ) and 10 gl of propidium iodide reagent ( 50 pg/ml in PBS ) .
The mixture was gently vortexed and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark .
Following incubation , 400 ul of the binding buffer ( 1X concentration ) was added to each tube .
Analysis by FACS was conducted within 1 h of assay completion for optimal results .
Controls of unreacted cells , propidium iodide-stained cells , and annexin-V-FITC-stained cells were run first to optimize settings .

Activated KG1 and KG1a cells were resuspended at 10°/ml in IMDM/20 % FCS .
FITC-dextran ( Sigma ) was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml , and the mixture was incubated at either 4 or 37°C for 30 min .
The cells were washed four times with cold PBS containing 1 % FCS and analyzed by flow cytometry .
T cell activation Human PBMC were obtained by leukapheresis from normal healthy adult donors .
T cells were purified by negative selection as previously described ( 38 ) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 mg/m !
streptomycin , and 20 mM HEPES .
T cells ( 1 X 10°/well ) were cultured in the absence ( in medium ) or the presence of the indicated number of gamma-irradiated ( 3000 rad '* '' Cs ) , in vitro-generated DC or DLC .
Cultures were incubated for 3 days ( DC ) or 5 days ( DLC ) at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO , in air atmosphere .
T cell proliferation induced by freshly isolated allogeneic PBMC was used as a reference .
Proliferation was assessed after the addition of 0.5 uCi/well [ methy ] -H ] thymidine ( New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) for the final 24 h of culture .
Cells were harvested using a 96-well cell harvester , and [ methy ! -H|thymidine incorporation was measured using a Beta Plate scintillation counting system ( Pharmacia/LKB , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
All determinations were performed in triplicate and expressed as the mean counts per minute + 1 SD .
RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by the RNA STAT-60 ( Tel-Test ) according to manufacturer 's recommendations .
Ten micrograms of purified RNA was incubated at 37°C for 15 min with 100 U of RNase-free DNase in a reaction , followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation .
Samples of 4 ug of DNase-treated RNA were reverse transcribed to cDNA by random primer extension in the presence of 0.1 Ci of [ « -°P ] 4CTP using Superscript-II Reverse Transcriptase ( Life Technologies ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
The RT reaction was terminated by heating at 70°C for 5 min , and radiolabeled cDNA was then purified on Spin-50 columns ( International Mould Engineering , Oden-ton , MD ) by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 3 min .
To normalize the input in all cDNA samples , equal amounts of cDNA counts were loaded in each PCR reaction containing 0.5 M gene-specific primer pairs .
Oligonucleotide primers specific for human DC-CK1 ( sense , AGT CCC ATC TGC TAT GCC CAG ; antisense , TAC GAA GAG TGG AAG GGA AAG ) and the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; sense , ATG GGG AAG GTG AAG GTC GGA GTC AAC GGA ; antisense , AGG GGG CAG AGA TGA TGA CCC TTT TGG CTC ) were used .
PCR was performed at 94°C for 1 min , 55°C for 1 min , and 72°C for 2 min for 30 cycles followed by a final extension time of 10 min at 72°C .
The amplified products ( 15 L1 ) were then incubated at 94°C for 5 min with 1 X 10° cpm of purified [ y-P ] dATP-labeled gene-specific probes followed by an incubation at 55°C for 10 min .
Hybridized PCR products were then resolved on 6 % PAGE followed by quantitation on a PhosphorImager scanner using ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynam-ics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described ( 39 ) .
Briefly , total RNA from unstimulated and stimulated KG1 and KG1a cells was isolated at the times indicated and equalized by serial dilution and ethidium bromide visualization .
Equal amounts of RNA were separated on a formaldehyde/agarose gel , transferred to nylon membranes , and hybridized against a human RelB cDNA probe .
The same blots were then probed for actin to assess equal loading and RNA integrity .
Western blot analysis Cell lysates were made from KG1 and KG1a cells cultured under the conditions and times indicated .
Samples containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE ( 4 % stacking/7.5 % resolving ) ; electroblotted to nitrocellulose ; probed with Abs against ReIB and PKCa , -I , - BIL , and -p ( all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) ; and visualized by chemiluminescent detection ( ECL , Amersham , Aylesbury , U.K. ) .

Samples containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with a **P-labeled oligonucleotide primer containing multiple NFB binding sites with or without anti-ReIB Ab or anti-NFxB ( p50 ) .
Samples were then separated on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel and exposed to film .
3239 Results Inhibition of PKC activation blocks cytokine-driven CD34* HPC-DC differentiation We have previously shown that PMA activation of PKC induces human CD34+~ HPC-DC differentiation , which could be blocked by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine .
To assess whether cytokine-induced CD34 `` *HPC-DC differentiation also involves PKC intracellular signaling , we cultured CD34*~ HPC in GM-CSF and TNF-a @ for 14 days with or without 0.2 nM staurosporine , a dose 3.5-fold less than the IC , , of PKC ( 0.7 nM ; Calbiochem Technical Report ) but at least 10- to 200-fold lower than the IC , , for protein kinase A and tyrosine kinases ( 40 ) .
Cell viability at 14 days was > 90 % in both culture conditions , but there was a greater expansion of cell number without staurosporine ( 3 % input number vs 1 X with staurosporine ) .
As can be seen in Fig .
14 , CD34 '' HPC cultured in cytokine alone developed characteristic DC morphology ( Joosely adherent large cells with irregular shape , prominent dendritic processes , and hair-like cytoplasmic projections ) .
In contrast , cultures containing staurosporine lacked cells with neurite processes and had greatly reduced numbers with hair-like cytoplasmic projections .
Staurosporine treatment also resulted in the loss of cells expressing characteristic DC surface markers , CD83 ( DC lineage specif-ic ) , MHC class II ( bright ) , and the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 ( Fig .
1B ) .
Of particular significance were the loss of CD83- and CD80-positive cells , as these Ags are not expressed on monocytes ( resting , in the case of CD80 ) ( 41 , 42 ) .
In contrast to CD83 and CD80 , there was only a modest decrease in CD14 * ( monocyte marker ) cells and no loss of CD33 * ( myeloid marker ) cells .
Cells from both culture conditions were CD34 negative and CD13 bright , demonstrating that staurosporine did not nonspecifi-cally block all differentiation .
These results suggest that staurosporine preferentially inhibited generation of CD83 DC compared with CD14+* monocytes .
Given that DC are the most effective APC in activating T cells , the decreased numbers of DC in the staurosporine-treated cultures should be reflected in a similar decrease in functional potency .
CD34 * HPC cultured in GM-CSF and TNF-a with staurosporine were significantly less effective in inducing allogeneic T cell proliferation than those cultured in cytokine alone , particularly at a low APC/T cell ratio ( Fig .
1C ) .
However , both were still superior to an unselected population of PBMC .
Together these data suggest that inhibition of PKC activation preferentially suppressed generation of DC from CD34 * HPC by GM-CSF and TNF-a , findings consistent with the differentiating effects of phorbol ester .
However , the scarcity , heterogeneity , and difficulty of manipulating primary CD34 ~ HPC made further analysis of the relevant signaling and genetic events difficult .
To overcome these obstacles we sought to establish a human cell line model of CD34 * HPC- > DC differentiation .
Although a heterogeneous lineage , DC share a constellation of defining characteristics , including morphology , lineage markers , function , and gene expression , that can be used to identify potential DLC .
KG1 develop characteristic DC phenotype ( morphology , surface Ag expression ) in response to cytokines or PMA We first examined the PMA-responsive CD34* myeloblast cell line KG1 .
KG1 cells in medium alone were typically round nonadherent cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
When cultured in GM-CSF and TNF- @ ( with or without IL-4 ) , PMA or PMA plus TNF-a ( and PMA plus ionomycin ; not shown ) , KG1 became loosely adherent and a subset developed long neurite processes and hair-like cytoplasmic projections ( best seen by Wright staining ; not shown ) , morphology 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3240 A minus staurosporine B - staurosporine + staurosporine CD83 MHC II CD80 CD86 CD14 CD33 FIGURE 1 .

C , Induction of allogeneic T cell proliferation .
CD34 * cells cultured with or without staurosporine as described above were harvested on day 14 , washed three times in PBS , plated in triplicate in the numbers indicated , and gamma irradiated ( 3000 rad *°°Cs ) .
Allogeneic irradiated PBMC were used for comparison .
Purified CD4 * T cells ( 1 X 10° ) were added to each well .
T cells were purified from leukapheresis collections of healthy donors by negative selection ( 38 ) and were free of accessory cells as demonstrated by Con A unresponsiveness .
After 54 h of culture , cells were pulsed with 0.5 uCi/well [ methy/-*H|thymidine before being harvested at 72 h. [ °HJTdR incorporation was measured using a Beta Plate scintillation counting system .
reported to be characteristic of DC ( 12 ) .
Morphologic changes began within 30 min of stimulation , were fully manifested within 48 h , and were stable over at least 2 wk in culture .
Development of the dendrite/neurite morphology was progressively more prevalent and pronounced with GM-CSF plus TNF-a- > PMA-PMA plus TNF- « ( and PMA plus ionomycin } .
In contrast to these stimuli , there was no effect of individual cytokines ( GM-CSF , IL-4 , or TNF-a @ ) , a cytokine combination that does not induce DC differentiation ( GM-CSF , IL-3 , IL-6 , and SCF ) , ionomycin alone , or ionomycin plus TNF- « ( data not shown ) .
While KG1a also became adherent when similarly stimulated , they did not change morphology .
Mature DC are typically characterized by expression of MHC class I , MHC class II ( high ) , the costimulatory molecules CD80 ( B7-1 ) and CD86 ( B7-2 ) , and the DC lineage marker CD83 ( reviewed in Ref .
12 ) .
Unstimulated KG1 cells expressed MHC I , MHC II ( bright ) , the myeloid markers CD13 and CD33 , CD34 , CD45RA , and CD86 ( dim ) but not €D40 , CD80 , the DC marker CD83 , or the monocyte marker CD14 ( Table I ) .
KG1a had lower expression of MHC class II and no CD86 staining .
We also found that KG1 and KG1a differed markedly in expression of TNF- « receptors 1 and 2 ( Fig .
3 ) , which may in part underlie the differences in TNF- « responsiveness between the two cell lines .
KG1 stimulated with GM-CSF plus TNF- « , PMA , PMA plus TNF- « , or PMA plus ionomycin up-regulated CD83 expression with the same temporal kinetics as the morphology changes ( Fig .

The level of CD83 expression has been correlated with the degree of DC maturation ( 43 ) , and CD83 up-regulation in KG1 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology FIGURE 2 .

PMA also up-regulated CD40 expression ( not shown ) and modestly down-regulated MHC II , which was reversed by addition of TNF-a or ionomycin .
Up-regulation of CD86 was most pronounced with addition of ionomycin , and ionomycin alone could up-regulate CD86 without inducing CD83 expression ( data not shown ) .
PMA plus ionomycin also induced expression of CD80 , although typically at low levels ( not shown ) .

Signals that induce KG1I-DLC differentiation also suppress proliferation and trigger programmed cell death In primary CD34* HPC we found the two hallmarks of PMA-driven DC differentiation are the complete inhibition of proliferation ( even to exogenous cytokines ) and induction of apoptosis ( 14 ) .
Proliferation is also absent in monocyte- > DC differentiation driven by GM-CSF , IL-4 , and TNF-a ( 4 ) or calcium ionophore ( 11 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5 , KG1 proliferation was suppressed by factors that induce DC/DLC differentiation ( PMA ( consistent with the findings presented in Ref .
44 ) , TNF-a , and most significantly by PMA plus TNF- « @ ) , but not by a cytokine combination ( GM-CSF , IL-3 , IL-6 , and SCF ) that does not generate DC .
Baseline proliferation of KG1la was 2.6-fold higher than that of KG1 and was unaffected by these stimuli ( data not shown ) .
Because the day 5 viability of KG1 was decreased in PMA ( 75 % viable ) , PMA plus TNF- « ( 70 % ) , and PMA plus ionomycin ( 67 % ) , we examined the induction of apoptosis by these stimuli ( Table II ) .

KG1 and KG1a cells were cultured for 7 days in medium , ionomycin ( 50 ng/m !
) , PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) , and PMA plus ionomycin .
Cells were thoroughly washed and added to purified resting allogeneic T cells in flat-bottom microtiter plates at an APC : T ratio of 1:10 .
Freshly isolated allogeneic PBMC were used as APC for comparison .
Proliferation was measured by [ °HJTdR incorporation .
DLC were capable of stimulating allogeneic T cell proliferation ( Fig .
7 ) and to a comparatively greater extent than unselected PBMC ( as a reference population of APC ) .
KG1 cultured in PMA and PMA plus ionomycin were significantly more potent at inducing T cell proliferation than KG1 cultured in medium , KG1a cultured in PMA with or without ionomycin , or unselected PBMC .
Consistent with the morphology and surface phenotype findings above , ionomycin appeared to drive further maturation/activation over PMA alone as measured by alloproliferation .
Lack of significant T cell proliferation with PMA-treated KG1a cells demonstrates the lack of PMA carryover from the original KG1/KG1a differentiation cultures .
KGI-DLC express characteristic DC genes Characterization of DC has classically relied on morphology , surface Ag expression , and function .
Recent molecular studies have identified genes that are expressed predominantly or exclusively by DC .
These include the RelB transcription factor ( see below ) and the chemokine DC-CK1 .
The DC-CK1 chemokine is expressed only by DC and not other APC , and appears to function as a che-moattractant for naive T cells ( 46 ) .
Unstimulated KG1 expressed low levels of DC-CK1 that were substantially up-regulated by PMA ( Fig .
8A ) .
Unexpectedly , the addition of TNF- « inhibited DC-CK1 up-regulation in KG1 .
The converse response was seen in KG1a ( Fig .
8B ) , where PMA has no effect on DC-CK1 expression but PMA plus TNF-a results in up-regulation , arguing against a direct inhibitory effect of TNF- @ .
Since PMA plus TNF-a induces KGI PMA PMA+TNF 0 4 24 72 120 0 4 24 72 120hrs 3243 early DLC differentiation in KG1a ( based on CD83 expression ) , these findings suggest that DC-CK1 expression is maximal during early/intermediate stages of DC maturation/activation ( induced by PMA in KG1 , PMA plus TNF-a in KG1a ) with much less expression in uncommitted progenitors ( KG1a ) or fully mature/activated DC ( PMA- plus TNF-a-treated KG1 ) .
Together , these findings demonstrate that in response to specific stimuli ( GM-CSF plus TNF-a @ , PMA with or without TNF-a , or ionomycin ) KG1 undergo differentiation to cells that have morphology , surface Ag phenotype , function , and gene expression characteristic of DC .
In addition , specific aspects of this differentiation appear to be mediated by specific signals .
Role of PKC in PMA-driven KG1-DLC differentiation Although PMA is a stable 2,3-diacylglycerol analogue and specific activator of the classical and new isoforms of PKC ( 47 ) , it is formally possible that PMA 's effects in KG1 are due to activation of a non-PKC phorbol ester receptor ( such as Unc-11 or n-chimaerin ) ( 48-50 ) .
To more rigorously prove specific PKC activation , KG1 were cultured in PMA with or without TNF-a with the highly selective PKC inhibitor bis .
Bis inhibited adhesion and morphologic changes in KG1 cultured in PMA without affecting cell viability ( Fig .
94 ) .
By FACS , bis inhibited up-regulation of CD83 and CD86 in response to both PMA and PMA plus TNF- « ( Fig .
9B ) .
Bis also prevented cell death induced by PMA plus TNF- « ( 91 % viable with PMA , TNF-a , and bis on day 5 vs 37 % viable with PMA plus TNF-a alone ) .
Finally , the addition of bis inhibited the development of allostimulatory capacity in KG1 cultured in PMA or PMA plus ionomycin ( Fig .
9C ) .
The fact that bis inhibition is considerably less effective with the addition of ionomycin is probably due to a lowered PKC activation threshold caused by increased intracellular calcium .
To further determine the nature of PKC-mediated signal transduction KG1-DLC differentiation , we asked whether the differing PMA responsiveness of KG1 vs KG1a was due to differing PKC isoform expression .
There are at least 11 different isoforms of PKC ( 47 ) , with individual isoforms appearing to mediate specific biological function ( 51 , 52 ) .
As seen in Fig .
10 , unstimulated KG1 expressed substantially more PKCa than KGla .
Unstimulated KG1a also did not express PKCBI , -BII , and -m , in contrast to KG1 .
Both KG1 and KG1a expressed PKCe , and neither expressed PKCy ( data not shown ) .
Induction of RelB expression during PMA-driven KG1I-DLC differentiation RelB is a member of the NFB transcription factor family that is highly expressed in DC but not monocytes ( 2 ) and may play an important role in DC differentiation and function .

By electromobility shift assays the levels of free ( i.e. , not bound to IB ) RelB heterodimers capable of binding to NFKB sites were also up-regulated by PMA in KG1 , while levels in KG1a were comparatively stable ( Fig .
11C , upper panels ) .
Examination of other NFB family members in KG1 and KG1a revealed that nearly all protein capable of binding NFB sites contained p50 ( NFKBI ) as one subunit ( Fig .
11C , lower pan-els ) as evidenced by the nearly complete supershifting by anti-p50 Abs .
This suggests that in KG1/KG1a RelB exists as a RelB/p50 heterodimer .
Discussion Why hemopoietic stem cells differentiate ( or do not ) into a specific mature lineage remains one of the enduring biological riddles .
Seminal work by a number of groups ( 53-68 ) have identified the critical receptor-mediated stimuli ( cytokines , CD40 ) that induce lineage commitment of human multipotential CD34 ~ HPC to DC in vitro .
We have sought to further characterize the intracellular signaling pathways that connect these receptor/membrane events to the nucleus .
We have previously shown that the PKC agonist PMA by itself directly triggers differentiation of human CD34 * HPC to DC , suggesting a critical and specific role of this pathway in lineage commitment to DC ( 14 ) .
This is supported by observations that the receptor-mediated stimuli ( GM-CSF , IL-4 , TNF-a , and CD40 cross-linking ) that induce DC differentiation all can activate PKC as part of their intracellular signaling pathways ( 15-19 , 69 ) .
We now find that the PKC inhibitor staurosporine blocks cytokine-driven CD34 *~ HPC-DC differentiation , indicating that PKC is part of the signaling cascade initiated by GM-CSF and TNF- « @ .
Although staurosporine can also block tyrosine kinase activity , this is typically at a substantially higher dose than that used in these experiments ( 40 ) .
We have also found that more specific PKC inhibitors ( e.g. , bis ) similarly inhibit CD34 `` *HPC-DC differentiation ( manuscript in preparation ) .
Staurosporine did not globally block differentiation as all cells lost the CD34 marker , and the generation of CD14 * cells ( most likely monocytes ) was comparatively less affected .
Rather , the generation of CD83 * DC was preferentially inhibited .
When considered with our previous findings that PMA treatment of CD34 * HPC only generates DC ( and 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology A KG1 KG1a te oke ke ks toot & Z te t C C £ £ s © € £ 5 a o s N C ?

3245 no other myeloid lineages ) , these data indicate that the intracellular pathway that specifically initiates DC lineage commitment goes through PKC .
This `` wiring '' may be unique to CD34 * HPC , as CD34 negative progenitors and monocytes have different responses to PMA ( K. P. Lee and K. Schlienger , unpublished observations ) .
To further study the intracellular events involved in DC differentiation and to circumvent the problems of studying this in primary CD34* HPC , we established a human leukemic cell line model of CD34* HPC-DC differentiation .
Work demonstrating that primary chronic myelogenous leukemia cells differentiated in vitro to functional DC suggested that this was feasible ( 70 ) .
Examination of the PMA responsiveness of a panel of CD34 * leukemic cell lines revealed that KG1 differentiated into cells with DC characteristics .
KG1 was isolated from a patient with erythroleu-kemia ( FAB M7 ) undergoing myeloblastic relapse ( 28 ) .
Serial passage of KG1 gave rise to the KG1a subline ( 71 ) , which by a number of criteria ( surface phenotype , gene expression , and growth factor unresponsiveness ) is thought to be arrested at a less differentiated stage than KG1 ( 32 , 72 , 73 ) .
In response to PMA KG1 was initially characterized to differentiate into macrophages ( 74 ) , although these original morphologic ( adherent cells with long pseudopodia ) , histochemical ( nonspecific esterase-positive , my-eloperoxidase-negative ) , surface Ag ( MHC II- and Fc receptor-positive ) , and functional ( phagocytosis ) findings have since been found to also be characteristic of DC ( reviewed in Ref .
12 ) .
PMA does not induce differentiation in KG1a , and although KG1 and KG1a have similar numbers of phorbol ester binding sites , they differ in PKC activity , translocation , and substrate phosphorylation ( 30 , 33 , 34 , 74 ) .
We believe that recharacterization of the KG1 response to PMA reveals it to actually recapitulate differentiation of the committed CD34 * myeloid DC/macrophage progenitor to DC .
Like the committed DC/macrophage progenitor ( 7 ) , KG1 express MHC II , CD34 , and CD86 , whereas KG1a are MHC II~-CD34 `` CD86_~ .
Unstimulated KG1 express little or no CD40 , but up-regulate expression following culture in PMA .
Stimuli shown to induce CD34 *HPC-DC differentiation ( GM-CSF plus TNF- « , PMA ) also induce differentiation of KG1 to DLC ( KG1-DLC ) , while non-DC cytokine ( s ) ( GM-CSF or TNF-a alone or GM-CSF , IL-3 , IL-6 , and SCF ) do not .
Unlike monocytes , ionomycin alone does not induce DC differentiation in KG1 ( or primary CD34 '' HPC ) , and likewise , PMA ( as a single agent ) does not drive DC differentiation in monocytes .
Suppression of KG1 cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by PMA are also characteristics we reported for primary CD34* HPC-DC differentiation driven by PMA .
Stimulation of KG1 with GM-CSF and TNF-a or PMA ( with or without TNF-a or ionomycin ) generates cells with a constellation of DC characteristics .
Morphologically , KG1-DLC are adherent with long neurite processes in culture and have hair-like processes/ veils on cytospin .
By surface Ag phenotype , KG1-DLC have characteristic DC expression of MHC I , MHC II ( high ) , CD13 , CD33 , the DC-specific lineage marker CD83 , and the costimulatory li-gand CD86 ( reviewed in Ref .
12 ) .
They do not express CD1a or the monocyte marker CD14 .
Expression of CD80 is present but low , suggesting that KG1-DLC are not fully mature or activated ( 12 ) .
Functionally , unstimulated KG1 can take up fluid phase Ag as measured by FITC-dextran uptake .
TNF- @ appears to deliver a signal that down-regulates Ag uptake , a hallmark of DC maturation/activation ( 37 ) consistent with the other effects ( morphology , surface Ag phenotype ) that TNF-a has on PMA-driven KG1-DLC differentiation .
Most importantly , KG1-DLC can function to activate T cells as evidenced by proliferation in an 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3246 allo-MLR .
This proliferation is substantially higher than that induced by either allogeneic PBMC or similarly cultured KG1a .
It is interesting to note that even though unstimulated KG1 express MHC II and CD86 , they do not stimulate significant T cell proliferation .
Because MHC II and CD86 expression are not substantially up-regulated by PMA , this suggests the enhanced allostimulatory properties of KG1-DLC are due to other components not measured .
Assessment of cytokine production ( especially IL-12 ) is currently underway .
Finally , KG1-DLC express genes that are predominantly ( ReIB ) or exclusively ( DC-CK1 ) found in DC .
Together , these four levels of characterization all point to the conclusion GM-CSF plus TNF-a or PMA stimulation of KG ! 1 generates cells of the DC lineage .
The inability to induce DLC differentiation in KG1a allows for comparison with KG1 of potential signaling pathways .
Blockade of DC differentiation in both KG1 and primary CD34* HPC by PKC inhibitors establishes a central role for PKC .
PKC activation most likely plays a direct role and does not simply induce autocrine secretion of cytokines ; for example , we find no evidence ( by PCR ) for induction of TNF-a expression in KG1 .
However , the difference between KG1 and KG1a can not simply be the absence of PKC signaling in KG1a given that both cell lines have bio-chemically measurable PKC activity ( 75 ) .
Likewise , we have found that although both CD34* HPC and CD34~ HPC respond to PMA , only CD34 ~ HPC differentiate to DC while CD34~ HPC become macrophages .
This suggests that there is a qualitative component of PKC activation .
Consistent with this is the differing expression of specific PKC isoforms in the cell lines .
KG1a express less PKCa and no PKCBI , -BII , or -p compared with KG1 .
Given that specific PKC isoforms have been associated with specific biological events in other systems ( e.g. , PKCO in T cell activation ( 51 ) and PKC in macrophage differentiation of HL-60 ( 52 ) ) , these findings suggest that the same may be true for DC differentiation .
Examination of the roles of specific PKC isoforms is currently underway .
KG1a also differ from KG1 in the response to TNF-a ; this is most evident in the induction of apoptosis .
This difference may be due to comparatively lower expression of both TNF receptors 1 and 2 on KG1la , and this membrane `` defect '' is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that apoptotic responses in KG1a can be restored by directly manipulating the sphingomyelin-cer-amide pathway triggered by TNF-a ( 76 , 77 ) .
The roles of ceramide ( and intracellular calcium flux ) in both apoptosis and DC differentiation are under study .
In addition to the differences between KG1 and KG1a , we found that distinct signals appeared to mediate distinct , nonoverlapping biological phenomena during KG1-DLC differentiation .
PKC activation by PMA appears to be a requisite inductive signal , initiating morphology changes , surface Ag expression , and allostimulatory capacity for T cells .
However , the addition of a TNF-a or calcium flux signal is necessary for full maturation/activation ( as assessed by morphology , surface Ag expression , and T cell pro-liferation ) and inhibition of cell proliferation/induction of apoptosis .
Down-regulation of soluble macromolecule uptake appears to be mediated entirely by TNF- « @ and to be independent of PKC activation .
The possibility that TNF-a and ionomycin are signaling through the same pathway is suggested by the lack of an additive effect when the two are combined ( PMA , TNF-a @ , and ionomycin ) and is being examined .
Together , these data suggest that there are discrete signaling pathways involved in specific aspects of DC differentiation ; PKC activation is required to initiate differentiation , and TNF-a ( which initiates several intracellular pathways ) and/or intracellular calcium flux is required for terminal maturation/activation and apoptosis .
However , this does not explain why A CELL LINE MODEL OF HUMAN DENDRITIC CELL DIFFERENTIATION some single signals ( PMA or CD40 cross-linking in primary CD34* HPC , calcium ionophore in monocytes ) are capable of driving complete DC differentiation/maturation from progenitors .
One possibility is that those particular pathways in those particular progenitors are directly linked to the genetic DC differentiation program .
Another possibility is that the primary signal in these specific progenitors triggers autocrine secretion of additional cy-tokines/factors that drive terminal maturation .
We are currently examining whether PMA induces TNF-a expression or calcium flux in primary HPC .
Regardless of the specific pathway , differentiation signals have to cross into the nucleus to initiate the requisite genetic programs .
Such bridges are very often preformed transcription factors , of which the NFB family is one of the best characterized ( reviewed in Ref .
78 ) .
Critical involvement of NFKB-responsive genes in DC differentiation has been found in chicken bone marrow cell lines ( 79 ) .
Involvement of rel/NFxB family transcription factors in DC differentiation is further suggested by the observations that RelB ( 80 , 81 ) is expressed at high levels in murine DC ( 82 ) and that RelB knockout mice have significant reductions in mature DC number and APC function ( 83 , 84 ) .
In human DC nuclear localization of RelB is associated with enhanced APC function ( 85 ) .
Both PMA and TNF-a @ up-regulate the activity of NFB family members ( including RelB by PMA ) ( 86 ) , and RelIB up-regulation is seen during CD34* HPC-DC ( 14 ) and monocyte- > DC ( 2 ) differentiation .
This is also true for KG1-DLC differentiation .
However , constitutive expression of RelB in KG1la suggests that DC differentiation may not simply be due to activation of RelB .
It is also possible that tonic expression of ReIB somehow blocks induction of NFKB-responsive genes as has been suggested for conditional v-re ?
expression ( 79 ) .
It is unclear why ReIB expression is not regulated in KG1a , but this suggests that some negative feedback signal has been lost .
The rapid up-regulation of RelB expression induced by PMA in KG1 may indicate the involvement of a more immediate transcription factor , although NFB can mediate its own transcription ( 78 ) .
Together , the data presented in this report corroborate an important role for PKC activation in DC differentiation from CD34 * HPC .
Characterization of the KG1 cell line model of CD34 *HPC-DC differentiation allows for a more detailed study of the signal transduction pathways involved .
Our initial studies indicate that the PKC , TNF- « , and/or intracellular calcium signaling pathways mediate specific phenomenon during this differentiation .
A potential connection of these pathways to the RelB transcription factor may provide a doorway into uncovering the genes that control DC differentiation and underlie the unique function of this lineage .
