The present study shows that , instead of T cells , B cells are generated in the thymus of a line , tge26 , of the human CD3e transgenic mice .
The accumulation of mature B cells in the thymus was found only in tge26 mice , not in other human CD3e transgenic mouse lines or other T cell-deficient mice , including CD3-e knockout mice and TCR-B/TCR-5 double knockout mice .
Hanging drop-mediated transfer into 2-deoxyguanosine-treated thymus lobes showed that lymphoid progenitor cells rather than thymus stromal cells were responsible for abnormal B cell development in tge26 thymus , and that tge26 fetal liver cells were destined to become B cells in normal thymus even in the presence of normal progenitor cells undergoing T cell development .
These results indicate that lymphoid progenitor cells in tge26 mice are genetically defective in thymic choice between T cells and B cells , generating B cells even in normal thymus environment .
Interestingly , tge26 thymocytes expressed GATA-3 and TCF-1 , but not LEF-1 and PEBP-2 « , among T cell-specific transcription factors that are involved in early T cell development , indicating that GATA-3 and TCF-1 expressed during thymocyte development do not necessarily determine the cell fate into T cell lineage .
Thus , tge26 mice provide a novel mouse model in that lineage choice between T and B lymphocytes is genetically defective .

It is generally believed that hemopoietic stem cells first differentiate into either lymphoid progenitor cells or myeloid progenitor cells , and that lymphoid progenitor cells further differentiate into T cells and B cells as well as NK cells and dendritic cells ( 4-6 ) .
Identification of lymphoid progenitor cells in primary hemopoietic organs such as fetal liver and adult bone marrow has still been an issue of controversy ( 7-9 ) , although most immature lymphoid cells in the thymus are shown to exhibit a differentiation potential that corresponds to lymphoid progenitor cells , being capable of becoming T cells , B cells , NK cells , and dendritic cells ( 10-13 ) .
It is also controversial whether lineage commitment of the progenitor cells into T cells takes place before or after migrating into the thymus ( 8 , 14 ) .
Even less is understood how lymphoid progenitor cells are committed to either T cells or B cells .
We have found recently that B220 , a CD45R determinant that is generally appreciated as a B cell-specific marker , is expressed by fetal liver progenitor cells that can generate T cells upon migration into the thymus , suggesting a possibility that some B cell-specific molecules are expressed by immature T-lymphopoietic progenitor T and B lymphocytes are both originated from multipotent Departments of *Immunology and *Anatomy and *PRESTO Research Project , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , and $ Center for TARA , University of Tsukuba , Tsukuba , Japan ; and `` Division of Immunology , Beth Israel Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02215 Received for publication March 23 , 1998 .

During further analysis of B cell-specific molecules expressed by immature T-lineage cells from various genetic backgrounds , we have found that B220 is highly expressed by most thymocytes in a human CD3e transgenic mouse line , tge26 .
Transgenic mice with high copy numbers of human CD3e gene , including tge26 , have been shown to exhibit early arrest of T cell development as well as of NK cell development ( 15 , 16 ) , and it has been suggested that the block in T cell development is caused by the overexpression of human CD3e proteins ( 15 , 16 ) .
The present study describes that mature B cells expressing IgM are generated only in the thymus of tge26 mice , not in other human CD3¢ transgenic mouse lines or in other T cell-deficient mice .
Our results show that lymphoid progenitor cells in tge26 mice are responsible for abnormal B cell development in the thymus , and that tge26 fetal liver cells are destined to become B cells even in normal thymus environment .
Interestingly , tge26 thymocytes express GATA-3 and TCF-1 , T cell-specific transcription factors that are involved in early T cell development , indicating that the expression by thymocytes of GATA-3 and TCF-1 does not necessarily determine their destination into T cells .
Thus , the present study describes a mutant transgenic mouse in that lymphoid progenitor cells exhibit the defect in the choice between T and B cells .

A TRANSGENIC MOUSE GENERATING B CELLS IN THE THYMUS Results B cells are generated in Tge26 human CD3 transgenic thymus To better understand molecular basis for early arrest of thymocyte development in tge26 human CD3 transgenic mice ( 15 ) , we first examined the expression of various surface molecules by tge26 thymocytes .
Consequently , we found that majority of tge26 thymocytes expressed high levels of B220-CD45R determinant ( Fig .
1A ) .
These B220 ' thymocytes in tge26 mice were IgM *IgD*CD19* and Thy-1~CD3~CD4~-CD8~ , the phenotypes of mature B cells ( Fig .
14 ) .
Although tge26 thymus was disorga-nized , lacking cortex and medulla architectures ( 30 ) , B220 * thymocytes were broadly localized within tge26 thymus lobes ( Fig .
1B ) , ruling out a possibility that B cells in tge26 thymocyte preparations might be derived from contaminated blood or proximal lymph nodes .
It has been shown that small numbers of B cells exist even in normal thymus ( 31 ; also shown in Fig .
14 ) .
To test whether B cells in tge26 thymus reflect normal thymic B cells because of the lack of T cell development , we next measured the absolute numbers of B cells in tge26 thymus and normal B6 thymus , as well as thymuses from TCR-B/TCR-8 double knockout mice , CD3-e knockout mice , and RAG-1 knockout mice in which T cell development is arrested at early CD4 CD8~ stage .
As summarized in Table I , IgM B cells in tge26 thymus were 1.2 X 10®/head , ~6 times more than the numbers of thymic B cells in normal B6 mice and ~60 times more than B cell numbers in TCR-B/TCR-8 double knockout thymuses and CD3-e knockout thymuses ( Table I ) .
Thus , B cells are unusually accumulated in tge26 thymus , neither simply reflecting the lack of T cell development nor reflecting the overrepresentation of normal thymic B cells .
To examine the origin of thymic B cells in tge26 mice , we analyzed the ontogeny of B cells in tge26 thymus .
As shown in Figure 24 , IgM *B220 * cells in tge26 thymus were generated after birth by 1 wk old , and the frequency and numbers of B cells in tge26 thymus reached to adult levels by 2 wk after birth .
Transient increase of BP-1*B220* cells , resembling pre-B cells , in tge26 thymus at 1 wk old and their subsequent decrease suggested that temporal development of B cells occurs in tge26 thymus .
To directly examine whether B cells are generated from progenitor cells in tge26 thymus , we performed organ culture of newborn tge26 thymus lobes in which B220+ B-lineage cells were still not gen-erated .
As shown in Figure 2B , IgM *B220 * cells were generated in the thymus lobes after 7 to 12 days of tge26 thymus organ cultures .
BP-1*B220* cells were found more at day 7 than at day 12 in tge26 thymus organ cultures ( data not shown ) .
Thus , B cells in tge26 thymus are generated from immature progenitor cells within the thymus environment in situ , even without the supply of migrating B cells .
Tge26 progenitor cells become B cells even in normal thymus environment To examine whether unusual B cell generation in the thymus is caused by abnormal progenitor cells or abnormal environment in tge26 thymus , we next set up hanging drop-mediated transfer of tge26 progenitor thymocytes into normal fetal thymus lobes that had been treated with dGuo .
We found that tge26 fetal thymocytes generated B220+*® cells in normal B6 thymus lobes as well as in tge26 thymus lobes ( Fig .
3 ) .
In contrast , normal B6 fetal thymocytes generated Thy-1 '' CD4/CD8 * cells in tge26 thymus lobes as well as in normal B6 thymus lobes ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , lymphoid progenitor cells rather than thymus environment are responsible for B cell generation in tge26 thymus .
It is interesting to note that many B220 * cells in tge26-derived thymocytes expressed low levels of 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology tgg26 4593 TCR-B '' - B6 TCR-87~ z 3.2 B220 0.2 UJ B220 Thy1.2 FIGURE 1 .

Fixed sections from adult thymus of tge26 mice or normal C57BL/6 mice were incubated with biotinylated Ab specific for either B220 or Thy-1.2 , followed by streptavidin-peroxidase .
Slides were developed in diaminobenzidine and counterstained in methyl green .

expression by B220* tge26 thymocytes appeared to be more pronounced in immature cells than in mature IgM *B220° B cells ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) , consistent with previous findings that immature B-precursor cells express Thy-1 even during normal B cell development ( 32 ) .
To analyze whether tge26 progenitor cells generate B cells even in the presence of normal T cell development in the thymus , fetal liver progenitor cells from tge26 mice were mixed at graded ratios with fetal liver cells from normal B6-Ly-5.1 mice , and transferred into dGuo-treated B6-Ly-5.1 thymus lobes ( Fig .
4 ) .
Tge26 cells ( Ly-5.1~2+ ) could be distinguished from B6-Ly-5.1 cells ( Ly-5.1+2~ ) by allele-specific detection of CD45 ( Ly5 ) mole-cules .
As shown in Figure 4 , Ly-5.1~ tge26-derived cells became B220 + even in the presence of normal Ly-5.1 * thymocytes .
It is interesting to note that the ratio of input cell numbers between tge26 and B6-Ly-5.1 fetal liver cells correlated with the ratio between Ly-5.1~ tge26-derived B cells and Ly-5.1* normal thymocytes generated in the thymus , suggesting that tge26 progenitor cells are capable of generating B cells at an efficiency comparable 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 4594 Table I .

Among the ( tge26 X B6 ) F ; mice tested , two of seven mice generated lymphoma showing the sign of hyperplasia of the thymus as previously described ( 41 ) ; the data from these two mice were omitted .
with normal progenitor cells generating T cells in the thymus .
These results indicate that tge26 progenitor cells efficiently generate B cells even in the thymus in which normal T cell development occurs , and that immature lymphoid progenitor cells in tge26 fetal liver are abnormal in generating B cells upon migration in the thymus environment .
Other human CD3€e transgenic mice do not exhibit excessive B cell development in the thymus To gain insights into the mechanism by which tge26 progenitor cells develop into B cells in the thymus , we examined whether two other strains of human CD3e transgenic mice may exhibit the similar accumulation of thymic B cells .
Tge600 mice carry the same human CD3e transgene as in tge26 mice , whereas tge2978 mice carry the transgene that encodes transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of human CD3e proteins lacking extracellular regions ( 15 ) .
Nonetheless , both tge600 and tge2978 mice exhibit severe defect in early T cell development ( 15 ) .
As shown in Table I , however , both tge600 and tge2978 human CD3¢e transgenic mice showed no increases in B cells in the thymus ; in contrast , tge26 thymocytes showed clear B cell accumulation .
It should be noted that tge2978 '* mice , which carry higher copy numbers ( 80-100 cop-ies ) of the transgene than those in tge26 `` '* mice ( 40-60 copies ) , did not exhibit any accumulation of B cells in the thymus , suggesting that B cell generation in tge26 mice is not a direct consequence of high copy numbers of human CD3e transgene .
Thus , thymic accumulation of B cells in tge26 mice is a phenotype specific for tge26 transgenic mice , not a phenotype commonly observed in other human CD3e transgenic mice , including tge600 and tge2978 strains .
We next examined whether B cells are predominantly generated even in the thymus of F , hybrid mice crossed between tge26 ho-mozygous transgenic mice and normal C57BL/6 ( B6 ) mice .
Unlike tge26 homozygotes , ( tge26 X B6 ) F , heterozygous mice exhibited T cell development in the thymus , although they had the thymus of 10~20 % cellularity of normal B6 mice ( Table I ) .
Despite the generation of many T cells , however , tge26 `` '~ heterozygous thymocytes contained increased numbers of B cells as compared with normal B6 thymocytes ( Table I ) .
Thus , the combination of complete T cell deficiency and increased B cell development in the thymus was found only in tge26 transgenic homozygotes , not in tge26 heterozygotes , whereas tge26 heterozygotes showed a compromised T cell development and increased B cell generation in the thymus .
Expression of GATA-3 and TCF-1 , but not PEBP-2a and LEF-1 , in Tge26 thymus We finally examined whether tge26 thymus , which generated B cells instead of T cells , may express modulated expression of transcription factors that are involved in early development of T cells .
To do so , RT-PCR analysis was performed for the expression of T cell-specific transcription factors such as GATA-3 , TCF-1 , PEBP-20A , PEBP-2 « B , LEF-1 , and Sox-4 ( Fig .
5A ) .
We have found that tge26 thymocytes expressed GATA-3 , TCP-1 , and Sox-4 , but failed to express PEBP-2a « A , PEBP-2 « B , and LEF-1 ( Fig .
5A ) .
The expression of Sox-4 in B cell-generating tge26 thymocytes is consistent with previous findings that Sox-4 is expressed in immature B cells as well as in T-lineage cells ( 33 , 34 ) .
On the other hand , it has been shown that the expression of GATA-3 and TCF-1 transcription factors is restricted in T cell lineage ( 35-38 ) .
It is therefore interesting to point out that GATA-3 and TCF-1 transcripts were detected even in IgM `` mature B cells as well as in IgM B220~ cells within tge26 thymus ( Fig .
5B ) .
The detection of GATA-3 and TCF-1 transcripts in IgM *B220+° B cells in tge26 thymus is not due to contaminated T-lineage precursor cells , since these transcripts were not detected in 10-fold- or 100-fold-diluted cDNA from IgM B220 - purified cells that contained equivalent amount of cDNA from IgM B220 ~ cells contaminated in IgM *B220 + preparations ( Fig .
5C ) .
Moreover , in contrast to B cells in tge26 thymus , GATA-3 and TCF-1 transcripts were not detected in IgM *B220 + B cells in the spleen of tge26 mice ( Fig .
5D ) , supporting the possibility that the expression of GATA-3 and TCF-1 by B cells in tge26 thymus reflects abnormal switch toward B cells of thymus-migrated progenitor cells that are otherwise directed into T-lineage development .
Collectively , these results indicate that 1 ) GATA-3 and TCE-1 expressed by thymocytes are not sufficient for their final decision to enter T cell lineage , and that 2 ) the defect in tge26 thymocytes is associated with the failure for thymocytes in expressing PEBP-2 « A , PEBP-2 « B , and LEF-1 .
It is also interesting to note that tge26 thymocytes expressed TCR-CB transcripts , although they did not express endogenous 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology A B220 B220 B220 CD8 1 d.o .

To examine whether TCR-B gene locus is rearranged in tge26 thymocytes , DNA prepared from tge26 thymocytes was PCR amplified with either DB- and J B-specific primers or V B8.2- and JB-specific primers .
Unlike normal thymocytes , tge26 thymocytes did not contain any detectable rearrangement of gene locus , including D-J rearrangement ( Fig .
6 ) .
These results suggest that TCR-CB transcripts expressed by tge26 thymocytes represent germline C # transcripts of unrearranged TCR-B gene .
Discussion The present study shows that , instead of T cells , B cells are generated in the thymus of tge26 human CD3e transgenic mice .
Selective B cell generation in the thymus was found only in tge26 mice , not in other T cell-deficient mice , including two other human CD3e transgenic mouse lines .
The transfer of fetal liver progenitor cells into thymus lobes showed that tge26 lymphoid progenitor cells were destined to become B cells even in normal thymus en-vironment , indicating that lymphoid progenitor cells in tge26 mice are genetically defective in thymic choice between T cells and B cells .
Interestingly , tge26 thymocytes expressed GATA-3 and TCF-1 , indicating that GATA-3 and TCF-1 expressed during thymocyte development do not necessarily determine the cell fate into T cells .
Thus , tge26 mice provide a novel mouse model in that FIGURE 2 .

lineage choice between T and B lymphocytes is genetically defective .
The present results show that abnormal lymphoid progenitor cells in tge26 mice are responsible for unusual accumulation of B cells in the thymus .
The accumulation of B cells in tge26 thymus is not merely due to the overrepresentation of normal thymic B cells by the lack of T cells that otherwise dominate thymocytes , since 1 ) such an accumulation of thymic B cells was not found in other T cell-deficient mice , including CD3-e knockout mice and TCR-B/TCR-8 double knockout mice ( Table I ) ; 2 ) the numbers of B cells in small tge26 thymus were approximately sixfold higher than those of B cells in normal large thymus ( Table I ) ; and 3 ) B cells in tge26 thymus mostly belong to CD5_ '' ° '' conventional B cells ( Tokoro and Takahama , unpublished results ) , unlike normal thymic B cells that are reported to be mostly CD5 * B-1 cells ( 39 ) .
Instead , immature lymphoid progenitor cells of tge26 mice either from fetal liver or fetal thymus efficiently and exclusively gave rise to B cells in the thymus ( Figs .
3 and 4 ) .
Moreover , in vitro fetal thymus organ culture experiments ( Fig .
4 ) and in vivo bone marrow transfer experiments ( B.W. , unpublished results ) indicated that such a selective generation of B cells by tge26 progenitor cells was found even in normal thymus environment in which normal progenitor cells undergo normal T cell development .
Furthermore , the early immigrants in tge26 thymus were still B220 BP1 Thy1 ~ , capable of generating temporal progression of pre-B and B cell differentiation in the thymus ( Fig .
2 ) , suggesting that the abnormal B cell development in tge26 thymus is due to thymic migration of abnormal lymphoid progenitor cells rather than abnormal thymic migration of further differentiated B-lineage cells .
Together , we think that tge26 lymphoid progenitor cells are destined to become B cells , being defective in the choice for T cells upon migration into the thymus .
Although tge26 progenitor cells are destined to become B cells in the thymus , tge26 thymocytes expressed several T cell-specific transcripts , including GATA-3 , TCF-1 , and unrearranged TCR-B .
The expression of these T cell-specific molecules by B cell-ori-ented tge26 thymocytes suggests that these molecules may be expressed during early thymocyte development before the final com A TRANSGENIC MOUSE GENERATING B CELLS IN THE THYMUS mitment to become T cells .
Together with our previous findings that several B cell-specific molecules are expressed during early T cell development in normal fetal liver ( 9 ) , it is possible that lymphoid progenitor cells that can become either T or B cells may first express several T cell- and B cell-specific molecules together , before reaching to T/B-branching point at which cells would terminate the expression of molecules specific for alternative lineage .
More interestingly , the results showing that GATA-3 and TCF-1 are expressed by tge26 thymocytes indicate that the expression of GATA-3 and TCF-1 by lymphoid progenitor cells is not sufficient for final decision for T cell development even after the migration into the thymus .
The expression of GATA-3 and TCF-1 even by IgM * B cells in tge26 thymus further indicates that the expression of these T cell-specific transcription factors does not prohibit the process of B cell development .
On the other hand , it has been shown that GATA-3 and TCE-1 are both essential for normal T cell development ( 26 , 36 , 38 ) .
Thus , it is conceivable that GATA-3 and TCE-1 are required for supporting earliest stages of T cell differentiation , but are sufficient for neither supporting T cell development nor inducing the commitment to T cell lineage .
We have also found that tge26 thymocytes expressed TCR-CB transcripts .
Since the sensitive PCR assay for D-J $ rearrangement failed to detect any TCR-B rearrangement in tge26 thymocytes , our results suggest that tge26 thymocytes express unrearranged sterile TCR-CB transcripts .
These results suggest that the expression of germline transcripts may occur before branching point between T and B cells , and does not necessarily reflect the commitment to T cells .
In addition , the failure to detect other T cell-specific transcription factors such as LEF-1 , PEBP @ 2A , and PEBP2 « B in tge26 thymocytes suggests that 1 ) the failure in expressing these transcription factors may be involved in early arrest of T cell development in tge26 mice , and 2 ) the expression of these transcription factors may not be required for the expression of germline TCR-Cf transcripts .
How are lymphoid progenitor cells in tge26 mice destined to become B cells even in thymus environment ?
Our results show that the aberrant switch from T cells to B cells in the thymus occurs only in tge26 mice , not in other two lines of human CD3e transgenic mice generated in the same laboratory , including a transgenic line carrying higher copy numbers of the transgene ( Table I ) .
It has been shown previously that the copy numbers of the human CD3e transgene correlate well with the expression levels of the CD3e transgenic proteins ( 40 ) , suggesting that B cell generation in tge26 thymus is due to neither high copy numbers of the transgene nor high expression of the transgenic products .
Rather , our results show that the aberrant B cell development in the thymus is limited only in the tge26 line among CD3e transgenic mouse strains .
Thus , we think that the defect of lymphoid progenitor cells in the choice between T and B cells may be a consequence of transgene insertion into a gene locus that is crucial for the commitment to either T cells or B cells , although it is still possible that the phenotype is caused by a unique pattern of expression of transgenic CD3e protein in early progenitor cells in tge26 mice .
Our results also show that heterozygous tge26 `` '~ mice still show the accumulation of B cells in the thymus , compatible with the possibility that abnormal B cell development in tge26 thymus is a genetically dominant phenotype .
It is thus possible that the enhancer and promoter in the human CD3¢ transgene may drive the expression of a nearby gene in thymus-migrated lymphoid progenitor cells , which in turn results in the aberrant conversion of the developmental direction from T cell lineage to B cell lineage .
Alternatively , it is also possible that a gene at the site of transgenic insertion may be disrupted , resulting in the switch from T cell development to B cell development in the thymus .

Genomic DNA from adult thymocytes of indicated mice was subject to TCR-B gene rearrangement analysis using indicated PCR primers .
PCR amplification was conducted for 25 cycles ( DB2-JB2 ) and 30 cycles ( V B8.2-1B2 ) .
PCR products containing JB2 segments were visualized with biotinylated probe hybridization .
Equal amount ( 0.5 pg/reaction ) of genomic DNA was used for PCR amplification to minimize possible deviation among multiple PCR reactions .
The sensitivity of every PCR detection was normalized by pretitrating PCR cycle numbers , so that rearranged signals can be visualized when 0.1 to 1 % of rearranged DNA from adult thymocytes was mixed in liver DNA ( 22 ) .
For the analysis of D-JB rearrangement , unrearranged DNA gives 1.8-kb signals corresponding to germline D-JB2 , whereas the rearrangement gives six discrete signals corresponding to rearranged D-J genes using six JB2 segments ( 22 ) .
For the analysis of VB8.2-DJB rearrangements , unrearranged DNA gives no signals , whereas the rearrangement gives discrete signals corresponding to rearranged genes ( 22 ) .

better understand the molecular mechanism causing this defect in the choice between T and B cells , we are currently attempting to identify the transgene-inserted gene locus in tge26 mice .
In conclusion , the present study describes a mouse strain in that lymphoid progenitor cells are destined to become B cells in the thymus .
These mice serve a unique model for the genetic defect in the choice between T and B lymphocytes .
Understanding molecular basis causing the defect in tge26 mice will provide a useful for IgM and B220 .
IgM *B220* cells and IgM -~B220~ cells were sorted by FACS-Vantage flow cytometry .
Purity of sorted IgM *B220* cells and IgM - B220~ cells was 95.9 and 96.6 % in B , and 99.6 and 98.1 % in C , respectively .
Equal numbers of IgM *B220* cells and IgM - B220~ cells were used for cDNA preparation , giving rise to largely comparable B ; , -microglobulin signals between the two groups .
C shows that , unlike IgM *B220+ purified cells , 10-fold- or 100-fold-diluted cDNA from IgM - B220~ purified cells failed to give rise to GATA-3 signals , ruling out the possibility that the GATA-3 signal from IgM *B220* purified cells could be derived from < 10 % of contaminated IgM B220~ cells .
