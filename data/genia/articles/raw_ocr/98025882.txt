Modulation of mRNA Expression of a Novel Human Myeloid-Selective CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Gene ( C/EBPe ) By Doris Y. Chih , Alexey M. Chumakov , Dorothy J .
Park , Agnes G. Silla , and H. Phillip Koeffler Human C/EBPe is a newly cloned gene coding for a CCAAT/ enhancer binding protein that may be involved in the regulation of myeloid differentiation .
Our studies showed that levels of C/EBPe mRNA were markedly increased in NB4 cells ( promyelocytic leukemia line ) , because they were induced by 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9-cis RA ) to differentiate towards granulocytes .
Accumulation of C/EBPe mRNA occurred as early as 1 hour after exposure of NB4 cells to 9-cis RA ( 5 x 10~ ' mol/L ) ; and at 48 hours , levels were increased by 5.1-fold .
Dose-response studies showed that 10~ ' to 10~° mol/L 9-cis RA ( 12 hours ) resulted in peak levels of C/EBPe mRNA ; but even 10~ '' ° mol/L 9-cis RA increased levels of these transcripts .
NB4 cells pulse-exposed ( 30 minutes ) to all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , washed , and cultured ( 3 days ) with either dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) or hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) had a prominent increase in levels of C/EBPe mRNA and an increase in granulocytic differentiation , but exposure to either DMSO or HMBA alone had no effect on base levels of C/EBPe and did not induce differentiation .
Macrophage-differentiation of NB4 reduced levels of C/EBPe EMATOPOIETIC CELLS committed to the myeloid lineage progress through a complex series of differentiation steps before reaching the morphologically and functionally distinct end-stage of macrophages and neutrophils .
While differentiating , these cells are continually reprogrammed to express stage-specific genes through the activation of regulatory transcription factors . ' ''
Consequently , as studies on myeloid genes suggest , transcription factors play a critical role in myelopoiesis and untimely transcriptional activity may result in a failure to differentiate and promote leukemic growth . '' ''
To understand the process of normal myeloid differentiation , identification and characterization of the important regulatory factors integral to the myeloid lineage are important .
Members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors have been implicated in a number of developmental and growth regulatory processes in several cell types .
* '' ' In the hematopoietic system , C/EBP- « , - # , and -8 showed a coordinated pattern of expression in differentiating myeloid cells and appeared to play decisive roles in myelopoiesis . ''
These three C/EBP isoforms also collaborated with the Myb onco-protein to induce the expression of myeloid-specific target genes , even in cells of heterologous tissues such as erythro-blasts or fibroblasts .
* Expression of C/EBP-/ # was found to parallel the differentiation of myeloid cells to macrophages . ''
Furthermore , mice containing a homozygous null mutation of either the or the C/EBP-a « were found to be defective in either macrophage functions or granulocyte de-velopment , respectively .
`` * '' * Another C/EBP-like factor , C/ EBP-y , was found to be expressed ubiquitously '' and cooperated with Fos to bind to positive regulatory element-I ( PRE-I ) , which is a strong enhancer element essential for the expression of the human interleukin-4-encoding gene . ''
Recently , we and others have isolated another member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors , C/EBPe . ' '' '' '' ''
This gene has two exons and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein of 32 kD . ''
The DNA sequence analysis of C/EBPe shows Blood , Vol 90 , No 8 ( October 15 ) , 1997 : pp 2987-2994 mRNA .
Nuclear run-off assays and half-life studies showed that accumulation of C/EBPe mRNA by 9-cis RA was due to enhanced transcription .
Furthermore , this C/EBPe mRNA accumulation did not require synthesis of new protein factors because 9-cis RA induced C/EBPe mRNA accumulation in the absence of new protein synthesis .
ATRA also induced expression of C/EBPe protein in NB4 cells , as shown by Western blotting .
In contrast to the increase of C/EBPe in 9-cis RA-mediated granulocytic differentiation , the DMSO-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells down the granulocytic pathway was associated with an initial reduction of C/EBPe mRNA levels .
In summary , we have discovered that expression of C/EBPe mRNA is markedly enhanced as the NB4 promyelocytes are induced by retinoids to differentiate towards granulocytes .
This induction of C/EBPe mRNA expression is transcriptionally mediated and occurs in the absence of synthesis of additional protein factors .
We suspect that the C/EBPe promoter/enhancer contains a retinoic acid-re-sponse element that is directly stimulated by retinoids .

that the gene encodes a protein highly homologous to rat CRP1 . '' '
Similar to other C/EBP isoforms , C/EBPe binds to a consensus C/EBP binding site . '' ''
Remarkably , C/EBPe shows a restricted expression in cells of the myeloid lineage , especially during their differentiation toward granulo-cytes . ''
Expression studies of this gene showed that it is expressed independently of other C/EBP proteins .
Such a restricted pattern of expression suggests greatly that the gene may play an important role in the regulation of myelopoiesis .
Therefore , in the present study , we examine the regulation of C/EBPe expression during differentiation of myeloid cells by culturing several myeloid cell lines with various differentiating agents .
Our data suggest that the expression of C/ EBPe is closely associated with the retinoid-mediated differentiation of early myeloid cells to granulocytes and that this expression is controlled by transcriptional mechanisms in the absence of new protein synthesis .

Nonretinoids used alone did not alter the low levels of C/EBPe transcripts .
However , cells primed with ATRA and then treated with either HMBA or DMSO , both potent granulocytic-inducing agents , '' resulted in a greater than 8- to 10-fold increase in C/EBP transcript level .
In contrast , both TPA and vitamin D ; induced NB4 cells to differentiate down the monocytic pathway . ''
NB4 cells pulsed with ATRA for 30 minutes and then treated with either TPA ( 5 X 10~° mol/L ) or vit D ; ( 10~ ' mol/L ) for 3 days became adherent ( > 90 % and > 80 % , respectively ) , as consistent with monocytic differentiation .
ATRA-primed cells treated with TPA ( 5 x 10~° mol/L ) or 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 107 mol/L ) for 3 days showed an approximately 10-fold reduction of C/EBPe mRNA levels .
Regulation of C/EBPe mRNA expression in NB4 cells treated with 9-cis RA .
To determine if 9-cis RA affected C/EBPe expression at the level of initiation of transcription , nuclei both from NB4 induced with 9-cis RA ( 5 X 10~ ' mol/ L ) for 12 hours and from untreated NB4 ( as control ) were isolated and subjected to run-off transcription assays .
The rate of transcription of C/EBPe genes in vivo , as shown by the amount of labeled RNA hybridizing to the full-length C/ EBPe cDNA on the dot blot ( Fig 3A ) , was increased more than threefold in NB4 cells treated with 9-cis RA than the untreated NB4 control cells , as shown by radioactive counts ( normalized with B-actin ) .
The half-life of C/EBPe mRNA was measured by calculating the decay of RNA accumulation after transcription was blocked with actinomycin D ( Fig 3B ) .
Cumulative radioactive counting showed that the half-life of NB4 cells was approximately 2 hours in both the presence and absence of 9-cis RA treatment .
To examine whether C/EBPe mRNA induction by 9-cis RA was dependent on ongoing protein synthesis , NB4 cells were preincubated with cycloheximide ( 10 pg/mL ) for 30 minutes and then treated with 9-cis RA ( 5 X 10~ ' mol/L for 4 , 6 , and 8 hours ) .
The data show that upregulation of the C/EBPe mRNA by 9-cis RA occurred even in the absence of protein synthesis ( Fig 3C ) .
To examine whether the induction of C/EBPe mRNA by 9-cis RA in NB4 cells is matched by the induction of the C/EBPe protein , NB4 cells were cultured with ATRA ( 5 X 107 '' mol/L ) for different durations .
Cells were harvested and lysates were examined by Western blotting .
Parallel to the increase of C/EBPe mRNA , the C/EBPe protein levels began to increase by 1 hour ( Fig 3D ) .
The maximum induction occurred by 24 hours ( > 5-fold ) .

The C/EBPe mRNA level increased approximately twofold by 6 hours of ATRA-induction ( Fig 5A ) .

EBPe gene during their differentiation .
We found that RA treatment increased the abundance of C/EBPe mRNA approximately twofold in HL-60 and U937 cells and approximately fivefold in NB4 cells .
Accumulation of C/EBP mRNA paralleled the increased granulocytic differentiation of the cells .
This occurred most prominently in the NB4 cells .
These findings paralleled our data '' '' and the data of others '' using fresh human hematopoietic cells .
The early , normal hematopoietic stem cell ( CD34*/CD33~T ) had very weak expression of C/EBPe ; the CD34 */CD33 * more mature myeloid stem cell expressed slightly more C/EBP .
As the cells differentiated to promyelocytes , myelocytes , metamye- CHIH ET AL locytes , and granulocytes , levels of C/EBPe mRNA obtained a plateau elevated level .
In contrast , monocyte and macrophages had very low levels of expression ; and in erythroid cells , C/EBPe was undetectable .
Taken together , these results suggest an important function for C/EBP at the myeloblast/ promyelocyte stage of granulocyte differentiation .
Analysis of C/EBPe deletional mice will further help determine the role of C/EBP in hematopoiesis .
The contribution of transcription and mRNA stability to the increase in steady-state levels of C/EBPe observed in retinoid-stimulated NB4 cells was examined .
Stability of the C/EBPe transcripts as assayed by measuring the decay of message in the presence of actinomycin D showed no change during 9-cis RA-mediated differentiation of NB4 cells to granulocytes .
Rate of transcription of the C/EBPe gene was also measured from nuclei isolated from both untreated NB4 and NB4 cells induced with 9-cis RA .
The retinoid ( 5 x 10~ ' mol/L ) increased the rate of transcription of C/EBPe by approximately threefold at 12 hours , consistent with the level of induction of C/EBPe mRNA observed by Northern analysis .
Also , ATRA-induction of NB4 cells resulted in a peak fivefold induction of C/EBPe protein at 24 hours , paralleling the increase in the transcript levels .
The fact that they stimulated accumulation of C/EBPe mRNA in the absence of new protein synthesis is further evidence to suggest that retinoids have a direct effect on transcription of C/EBPe .
The enhancement in accumulation of C/EBPe mRNA by retinoids may not merely be a reflection of granulocytic differentiation , because HL-60 cells cultured with DMSO undergo granulocytic differentiation , '' but levels of C/ EBPe mRNA at least initially decreased rather than in-creased .
These studies suggest strongly for transcriptional control of C/EBP via a retinoid acid response element .
Could the prominent induction of expression of C/EBP mNRA observed in NB4 be unique to this cell type ?
The cell line NB4 was established from the leukemia cells of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia® '' and the cells contain the pathognomic chromosomal rearrangement 1 ( 15 ; 17 ) resulting in the PML-RAR fusion gene . ''
This PML-RAR fusion product has been suggested to block or interfere with transcription of genes critical to myeloid differentiation , perhaps by sequestering the RARa in non-functional locations as shown by a nuclear speckled pattern of the fusion protein . ''
High concentrations of retinoic acid allow the RAR fusion protein to assume a more typical RAR nuclear location .
It is possible that the retinoid-PML/RAR complex more readily binds and transactivates the C/EBPe gene because retinoids had only a moderate enhancement of C/EBPe in HL-60 and U937 cells , even though the ligand induced granulocytic differentiation of these cells similar to NB4 .
Another explanation for the prominent effect of retinoids in NB4 could relate to expression of other transcriptional factors that combinatori-ally interact with the RA/RAR to activate C/EBPe .
Furthermore , cells that normally can not express C/EBP , such as early erythroblastic K562 cells , can not be induced by RA to express C/EBPe , '' ° suggesting that modulation of the gene in the cells requires more than retinoid ligand and its receptor .

TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL OF C/EBPe cell lines that are resistant to retinoids as well as functional analysis of a potential retinoic acid response element in the C/EBPe gene are required .
