Characterization of a New Isoform of the NFAT ( Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells ) Gene Family Member NFATc* ( Received for publication , April 22 , 1996 , and in revised form , June 6 , 1996 ) Jungchan Park , Atsuko Takeuchi , and Surendra Sharma # From the Section of Experimental Pathology , Department of Pathology , Roger Williams Medical Center-Brown University , Providence , Rhode Island 02908 The cyclosporin A ( CsA ) /FK506-sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) plays a key role in the inducible expression of cytokine genes in T cells .
Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non-T immune cells , the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells .
To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins , we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line .
The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform , NFATe.B , of the NFAT gene family member NFATec ( designated here NFATc.a ) .
The amino acid sequence of NFATe.f differs from that of NFATc. « in the first NH , -terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus .
Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two mRNA species of 2.7 and 4.5 kilobase pairs , while an NFATe.B-specific probe detected only the 4.5-kilobase pair mRNA which was preferentially expressed in the spleen .
Transient expression of NFATe.B was capable of activating an interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene in stimulated Jurkat cells in a CsA-sensitive manner .
However , NFATc. # neither bound to the « 3 element ( an NFAT -binding site ) in the tumor necrosis fac-tor- « promoter nor activated the tumor necrosis fac-tor- « promoter in cotransfection assays .
These data suggest that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes .
Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) is a multicompo-nent transcription factor regulating expression of several cytokine genes in antigen-activated T cells and functions as a major molecular target for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( reviewed in Refs .
1-3 ) .
It consists of a protein kinase C-inducible nuclear component and a pre-existing cytoplasmic component ( s ) whose translocation to the nucleus is dependent upon Ca* '' * mobilization ( 4 , 5 ) .
The protein kinase C-inducible nuclear component was found to be AP-1 * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant CA55910 .

proteins ( 6 ) , and several members of the Fos and Jun families have been described to participate in NFAT complexes , contributing to NFAT-dependent transcription ( 7-10 ) .
Although an investigation of the inducible expression of the IL-2 gene led to the primary characterization of NFAT complex , functional NFAT binding sites have also been identified in the regulatory regions of other cytokine genes , including IL-3/granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( 11 , 12 ) , IL-4 ( 13-15 ) , IL-5 ( 16 ) , and TNF-a ( 17 ) , whose expression has been shown to be CsA-sensitive .
Recently several cytoplasmic components of NFAT , collectively termed NFAT family proteins , have been cloned and characterized in murine and human T cells .
They include NFATp ( 18 ) , NFATc ( 19 ) , NFATx/NFAT4/NFATc3 ( 20-22 ) , and NFAT3 ( 21 ) and share a conserved region of ~290 amino acids .
This region exhibits DNA binding activity and shows a limited sequence similarity to the DNA binding and dimeriza-tion domains of dorsal/rel/NFkB transcription factors ( reviewed in Ref .
23 ) .
Another common feature of these proteins is the presence of the repeated motifs of serine-proline residues ( SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX ( D/E ) ( D/E ) ) in the region ( 20 ) .
Most ( if not all ) NFAT family proteins appear to undergo dephosphorylation in response to stimuli increasing intracellu-lar Ca** concentration .
It has been suggested that they are either direct or indirect substrates for the Ca**/calmodulin-de-pendent phosphatase calcineurin which is sensitive to the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 .
For example , NFATp acts as an in vitro substrate of calcineurin ( 24 , 25 ) and becomes dephosphorylated upon treatment with ionomycin prior to its nuclear translocation .
This dephosphorylation process is blocked by CsA and FK506 ( 5 ) .
Moreover , phosphorylated NFATp fails to bind to the IL-2 NFAT binding site , suggesting that CsA not only affects nuclear translocation but also DNA binding ability of NFAT family proteins ( 26 ) .
It has recently become clear that NFAT also plays an important role in production of cytokines by non-T cells of the immune system .
Although originally described as a T cell-specific transcriptional factor , NFAT proteins , in particular NFATp , have been detected in several other hematopoietic cells including B cells ( 27-29 ) , natural killer cells ( 30 ) , mast cells ( 31 ) , and macrophages ( 5 ) as well as in neuronal cells ( 32 ) albeit with no well defined function .
We have been characterizing NFAT function in human B cells and showed that B cell NFAT complex was indistinguishable from that detected in T cells ( 9 , 27 ) .
Furthermore , we have recently shown that CsA leads to phos-phorylation of nuclear NFATp in transformed B and T cells and inhibits its DNA binding ( 26 ) .
In this regard , CsA has been shown to directly inhibit B cell activation elicited by anti-lg , SAC , or ionomycin which induce Ca** mobilization during the signaling processes ( reviewed in Ref .
33 ) .
Importantly , it also prevents TNF-a production by B cells stimulated through their surface Ig receptor ( 34 ) .
Furthermore , in murine T cells , a 20914 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Transcription Factor NFAT Gene Family transcription factor similar or identical to NFATp has been shown to bind to the CsA-sensitive regulatory element ( « 3 element ) in the TNF-a promoter ( 17 , 35 ) .
Thus , NFAT appears to mediate CsA-sensitive transcriptional regulation of the TNF-a and other yet unidentified , activation-associated genes in B cells by similar mechanisms operational in T cells .
To further understand the structural complexity and function of NFAT , we screened a cDNA library derived from Raji B cells to isolate a unique NFAT family protein ( s ) .
Here , we report cDNA cloning and initial characterization of a new isoform , designated NFATc.B of NFAT family member NFATec. « . ''
This molecule exhibits a unique expression pattern and likely plays a role in the mutually exclusive expression of cytokine genes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA Cloning-A cDNA library constructed in Agt10 vector was purchased from Clontech Inc. ( Palo Alto , CA ) and was derived from a human Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line Raji using both random and oli-go ( dT ) primers .
The cDNA library was screened under low stringency conditions using a radiolabeled DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1-1257 in the published murine NFAT p sequence ( 18 ) as a probe .
The DNA probe contained NH , -terminal of the rel similarity domain and its upstream sequence .
This was obtained from murine NFATp cDNA clone ( kindly provided by Drs .
A. Rao and P. Hogan ) by double digestion with HindIII and Accel .
Positive clones were isolated by three rounds of hybridization , and inserts were subcloned into Bluescript plasmids .
The clone containing the longest cDNA insert was sequenced on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination ( U. S. Biochemical Corp. ) and polymerase chain reaction sequencing ( Pro-mega ) methods .
Northern Blots-A Northern blot with poly ( A ) *® RNAs isolated from multiple human tissues was purchased from Clontech Inc. For the common probe of NFATe.a and NFATe.B , we used a 467-base pair Nsil-Neo !
fragment of a NFATe.f cDNA clone .
The nucleotide sequence of this fragment is identical between NFATe. « and and corresponds to nucleotides 383-848 in the published NFATe. « cDNA sequence ( 19 ) and to nucleotides 180-646 in the NFATe.6 cDNA of this study ( Fig .
1 ) .
For the NFATe.6 unique probe , we used a 418-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment encompassing the region encoding amino acids 676-814 located downstream of the rel similarity domain of NFATe.B .
The human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was used to quantitate the amounts of RNA loaded in each lane .
DNA probes were labeled by random priming and hybridization was carried out in 5 X SSPE , 50 % formamide , 5 x Denhardt 's solution , 2 % SDS , 100 ug/ml herring sperm DNA at 42 °C .
The filter was washed in 2 x SSC , 0.05 % SDS at room temperature , and subsequently in 0.1 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 55 °C .
The same filter was used for all subsequent hybridizations .
Generation of Recombinant Proteins and Purification-Escherichia coli expression plasmids for three deletion derivatives of proteins were constructed into pQE30 ( Qaigen , CA ) by subcloning the NFATe.6 cDNA fragments , which express recombinant proteins tagged with a hexahistidine at the NH , terminus .
Using the cDNA clone as template , a polymerase chain reaction fragment was generated with 5'- and 3'-primers containing restriction linker sites , BamHI and Kpnl , respectively , and subsequently the restricted polymerase chain reaction products subcloned into pQE30 to generate the NFATe.8 ( amino acids 214-814 ) ( Fig .
4 ) expression vector .
The other two deletion mutants , NFATe.6 ( amino acids 214-769 ) and NFATe.6 ( amino acids 214-703 ) ( Fig .
4 ) , were derived from the NFATe.8 ( 214-814 ) expression plasmid by blunt end ligation of the plasmid after restriction digestion with either Smal and EcoRV or Agel and EcoRV , respectively .
Murine NFATp expression vector pNFATpXS ( I-297 ) , constructed in pQE31 ( Qaigen , CA ) , was kindly provided by Drs .

For competition assays , 25-100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction mixtures as indicated in the figure legends .
Where indicated , c-Fos and c-Jun proteins were included in the binding reaction mixtures to test their association with NFAT proteins .
After 20-min incubation at room temperature , the reaction products were separated on a 4 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel ( 27 ) .

The human TNF- « promoter ( -614/+20 ) -luciferase plasmid constructed in pGL2 basic vector was kindly provided by Dr. F. de la Brousse , Tularik , Inc. ( 40 ) .
The pTKGH plasmid which expresses human growth hormone ( hGH ) under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter serves as an internal control for the efficiency of transfection .
Exponentially growing Jurkat or Raji cells ( 1 % 10 '' cells ) were transfected with 5 ug of 5B3.1 or the TNF- « promoter-luciferase plasmid , 2.5 pg of pTKGH , and 15 pg of either or NFATp expression vector by electroporation at 240 V , 960 microfarads .

Transfection efficiencies were normalized by hGH assays using Allegro HGH kit ( Nichols Institute Diagnostics , CA ) .
RESULTS Cloning of NFATe.B-To isolate a cDNA clone ( s ) which pu tatively encodes an NFAT family protein from B cells , we screened a Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line Raji cDNA library ( approximately 7 X 10° plaques ) with a cDNA probe encoding and the rel similarity domain of the murine NFATp at low stringency ( 18 ) .
Several positive clones were isolated and divided into two different groups closely related to NFATe. « ( 5 clones ) and NFATp ( 10 clones ) , respectively , by initial analysis using restriction digestion and partial sequenc-ing .
Interestingly , one clone related to the NFATc. « gene showed nucleotide sequence differences in both 5'- and 3'-end 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 20916 130 259 388 517 646 775 904 1033 1162 1291 1420 1549 1678 1807 1936 2065 2194 2323 2452 2581 2710 Transcription Factor NFAT Gene Family gaat MOT G L E D Q E F D F E P FOE F N CAGCGCGACGAGGGCGCCGCCECGECCGCCCCAGAACACTATGGCTATGCATCCTCCAACGTCAGCCCCGCCCTGCCECTCCCCACGECGCACTCCACCCTECCGECCCCETECCACAACCTTCACACC Q R D B G A A A A A B OR H Y G ¥ A S S N V S P A L P L P oT A H S T L P A PoC H N L Q T TCCACACCGGGCATCATCCCGCCGGCGGATCACCCCTCGGGGTACGGAGCAGCTTTGGACGGTGGGCCTGCGGGCTACTTCCTCTCCTCCGGCCACACCAGGCCTGATGGGGCCCCTGCCCTGGAGAGT § T BP G I I P P A D H B S G Y G A A L D G G P A G S CCTCGCATCGAGATAACCTCGTGCTTGGGCCTGTACCACAACAATAACCAGTTTTTCCACGATGTGGAGGTGGAAGACGTCCTCCCTAGCTCCAAACGGTCCCCCTCCACGGCCACGCTGAGTCTGCCC POR I R I T S G L vy H N N N For HD V B v E D V L P S S K R S Pos T A T $ L P AGCCTGGAGGCCTACACAGACCCCTCETGCCTEAGCCCEGCCAGCAGCCTETCCTCCCGEGAGCTECAACTCAGAGGCCTCCTCCTACGASTCCAACTACTCGTACCCGTACGCETCCCCCCAGACGTCG § L E A Y R D P S C L § B A S S L S § R S C N S R A S Ss ¥ E s N Y S Y P Y A P CCATGGCAGTCTCCCTGCGTGTCTCCCAAGACCACGGACCCCGAGCAGGGCTTTCCCCECGEGCTGGGGECCTECACACTGCTGAGTTCCCCGCGSCACTCCCCCTCCACCTCeCCCCececcacceTe P _ 0 P _C Y S ROK T T D BP BOE G F P R G L G A C T L L S P ROH S P S TO S POR A S v ACTGAGGAGAGCTGGCTGGGTGCCCGCTCCTCCAGACCCGCGTCCCCTTGCAACAAGAGGAAGTACAGCCTCAACGGCCGGCAGCCGCCCTACTCACCCCACCACTCGCCCACGCCATCCCCGCACGGC _T BE W L G A R S S R B A S P C N K R OK Y S L N G R Q P P Y S P SP P _ S P TCCCCGCGGGTCAGCGTGACCGACGACTCGTGGTTGGGCAACACCACCCAGTACACCAGCTCGGCCATCGTGGCCGCCATCAACGCGCTGACCACCGACAGCAGCCTGGACCTGGGAGATGGCGTCCCT § P ROV S V T D D Ss WoL G N T T Q ¥ T s S A I V A A I N A L T T § L D L G D G V P GTCAAGTCCCGCAAGACCACCCTGGAGCAGCCGCCCTCAGTEGCECTCAAGGTGEGAGCCCETCEGGCAGGACCTGGECAGCCCCCCGCCCCCEGCCGACTTCECECCCGAAGACTACTCCTCTTTCCAG V K Ss ROK T T L E Q P P S V A LOK V E P V G E D L G S P P P A D F A POE D Y S s F Q CACATCAGGAAGGGCGGCTTCTGCGACCAGTACCTEGCGETGCCGCAGCACCCCTACCAGTGGGCGAAGCCCAAGCCCCTGTCCCCTACGTCCTACATGAGCCCCACCCTGCCCGCCCTEGACTEGCAG H0 I R K G G F C D Q Y L A v P Q HOP Y A K BoK POL T S Y M s BoT L P A L D W Q L P S H S G BOY R L R I E V q P K S HOH R A E G S R G A v K A Ss A G G H P I v CAGCTGCATGGCTACTTGGACAATGAGCCGCTGATGCTGCAGCTTTTCATIGGGACGECGCACGACCECCTGCTGCGCCCGCACGCCTTCTACCAGETECACCECATCACAGCCAACACCGTETCCACC Q L H G Y L E N E POL M L Q L F I G T A D D R L L R B H A F oY Q V H R I T G K T v Ss T ACCAGCCACGAGGCCATCCTCTCCAACACCAAAGTCCTGCAGATCCCACTCCTGCCGEAGAACAGCATGCGAGCCGTCATTGACTGTGCCGGAATCCTCAAACTCAGAAACTCCCACATTGAACTTCGG T S HOE A I L S N T K V L E I B L L PBE N S M R A V I D C A G I L K L R N S D E L R AAAGGAGAGACGGACATCGGGAGGAAGAACACACGGGTACGGCTGGTGTTCCGCGTTCACGTCCCGCAACCCAGCGGCCGCACGCTGTCCCTGCAGGTGGCCTCCAACCCCATCGAATGCTCCCAGCGC X G R T D I G R K N T R V R v OF R V H V P Q P G R T L v A Ss N P I E CoS TCAGCTCAGGAGCTGCCTCTGGTGGAGAAGCAGAGCACGGACAGCTATCCGGTCGTGGGCGGGAAGAAGATGGTCCTGTCTGGCCACAACTTCCTGCAGGACTCCAAGGTCATTTTCGTGGAGAAAGCC § A Q E L BOL V R K Q s T D § ¥ B ov v G G K K M V § G H N F L Q D § K V I F V E K A CCAGATGGCCACCATGTCTGGGAGATGGAAGCGAAAACTCACCGGGACCTETECAAGCCCAATTCTCTEGTGGTTGAGATCCCGCCGTTTCGGAATCAGAGGATAACCAGCCCCETTCACETCAGTTTC P D G H H V W BR M R A K T D R D L C K B N S L V V E I B P F R N Q R I T Ss PoV H V Sor TACGTCTGCAACGGGAACACAAAGCGAAGCCAGTACCAGCGTTTCACCTACCTTCCCECCAACGTTCCAATTATAAAAACAGAACCCACTGATGATTATGAGCCTGCTCCAACCTGTGGACCGGTGAGC ¥ v C N G K R K R S YQ ROF OT Y LOP , A N V BOI I K T B POT D D Y E B A BoT C G PoV S CAGGGCTTAAGTCCTCTCCCAAGACCATACTACAGCCAGCAGCTCGCGATGCCACCCGACCCCAGCTCCTGCCTCGTEGCCESCTTCCCECCCTGTCCECAGAGCAACCACCCTGATECCAGCGGCCCCT Q G L Ss POL POR Boy Yos A M P P D L V A G F B P C P Q R S T L M B A A P GGCGTGAGCCCAAGCTCCACGACCTTTCTCCCGCTGCCTACACCAAGGGCGTTGCCAGCCCGGGCCACTETCACCTCGGACTCCCGCAGCCGGCCECACAGECCCCCECCETCCAGGACGTEeCCCAGCC G vy s BP s § T T R OL BOL BOT P A L BPA R A To V T S D S ROS R P E R P § R T C P A AGTGGCCACGCACCCCGeCTCecCCesecasccaceeccescCCTecTGCCAaCAGCACTAAATGAAATAATACGAAATGACCTICTCCAGCACGAGCACCCACTCCtagttgccacattggagcactcag § G H A POR L A R A A T P G BoA A T A V N BE I I R N D L S T Ss T H s * ttcagcaggggtatgctgacttcagcagacaaagacttttgaatamataaactgaactcacacctggtaccactcagaacctccaactgactgaatgccaggagctgaacattaatatgtgcaaagatt te 2839 atgggaacggcccacacgcagtttgaceccacgcocagcocttctggcaccoectggggttcaatactggaagtgecttatttaaccagaccatca Fig .

Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human 6 .
Nucleotide sequences are numbered on the Zeft , and amino acid residues are numbered on the right .
Three SP repeat motifs are underlined , and the amino acid sequence flanked by arrows represents the rel similarity region .
A star denotes a stop codon .
regions , and further sequencing analysis of this clone , designated revealed an open reading frame encoding a new protein of 827 amino acids with deduced molecular mass of 89.5 kDa that is closely related to NFAT ' c. « previously reported by Northrop et al .
( 19 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
At the amino acid level , this clone displayed perfect sequence identity with NFAT ' c. « in the region corresponding to amino acids 30-684 with the exception of 2 amino acids at positions 219 ( Ser ) and 222 ( Arg ) in which the corresponding amino acids of NFATc. « are Gly and Gln , respectively .
The identical region includes the rel similarity domain and NH-terminal containing the SPXXSPXX-SPXXXXX ( D/E ) ( D/E ) repeat motifs that are well conserved in the NFAT family proteins , suggesting that the new NFAT family protein may play a similar biological role as other NFAT proteins ( Fig .
2B ) .
On the other hand , two unique regions were found in NFATe.f .
The first NH-terminal 29 amino acids of differ from that of NFATc. « and are rich in acidic amino acid content ( 8 of 29 amino acids ) , suggesting that this region may constitute a transactivation domain .
Another unique region of NFATe. $ is represented by an additional sequence of 142 amino acids at the COOH terminus , and this region , rich in proline residues ( ~20 % ) , shows no significant sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of other NFAT family members ( Fig .
24 ) .
Thus , the cDNA clone isolated here appears to encode a new isoform of NFAT ' c. « that most likely resulted from alternative splicing and/or transcription from separate promoters .
Expression Pattern of NFATc.B mRNA in Human Tissues-Previous reports have shown that Northern analysis of NFATc using 5'-end fragments of NFATe cDNA as a probe displayed two hybridizing bands with apparent sizes of 2.7 and 4.5 kb ( 20 , 21 ) .
To examine whether the new clone NFATc.f can be specifically assigned to one of these two bands , and to determine the tissue distribution of NFATe.B expression , we carried out Northern analysis of multiple human tissues using two sepa- rate probes .
As expected , when a common sequence of NFAT ' c. « and NFATc.f was used as a probe , two mRNA species with previously observed sizes were detected ( Fig .
3 ) .
However , an NFATe.B unique probe corresponding to the region downstream from the rel similarity domain detected only the 4.5-kb band , indicating that this band represents NFATe.8 mRNA .
The 2.7-kb mRNA , on the other hand , appears to encode NFATc. « ( 19 ) , as assessed by the reported cDNA size and its tissue distribution .
The expression pattern of these two mRNA species was distinct in different tissues .
NFATc. « mRNA was predominantly expressed in the thymus and peripheral leukocytes , and at lower levels in the spleen .
On the other hand , NFATe.8 mRNA was preferentially expressed in the spleen and at lower levels in all other tissues tested .
Interestingly , its expression level was higher than that of NFATec. « in all tissues except the thymus and peripheral leukocytes .
Thus , it appears that expression of these two isoforms may be differentially regulated in a cell type-specific manner .
Sequence-specific DNA Binding of NFAT ' c .
B to the IL-2 NFAT Site-To characterize biochemical properties of NFATc.fB , we generated three recombinant derivatives of NFATc. $ that were tagged with a hexahistidine at the NH , terminus .
NFATe.B ( 214-814 ) contains 601 amino acids corresponding to residues 214 to 814 which include the rel similarity domain ( ~290 amino acids ) and most residues at the COOH terminus of NFATe.B .
The other two polypeptides were derived from NFATe.B ( 214-814 ) by further truncation of the COOH terminus as shown in Fig .
4A .
The NFATc.6 ( 214-703 ) polypeptide is devoid of most COOH-terminal residues of NFATc.B , and thus resembles NFATc. « .
A deletion derivative of NFATp , NFATpXS ( 1-297 ) , which contains the rel similarity domain of NFATp ( 36 ) , was also purified and used as a positive control in DNA binding assays .
The deletion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography .

NFATe.B was unable to directly bind to the human IL-2 NFAT site ( Fig .
4C , lane 1 ) , but in the presence of Fos and Jun proteins , could form an NFAT complex ( Zane 3 ) , consistent with previous observations of NFAT complex formation in T and B cells ( 9 ) .
This binding was sequence specific because it was competed away with excess unlabeled NFAT oligonucleotides , but not with nonspecific or mutant NFAT oligonucleotides .
A diffuse band pattern is likely due to partial degradation of the purified NFATc.B ( 214-814 ) protein since the smaller polypeptide NFAT ' c.B ( 214-703 ) which showed less degradation did not show a diffuse band pattern ( Fig .
7 , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Requirement of Fos and Jun for in Vitro NFAT Complex Assembly-We have previously shown that both Fos and Jun were required for efficient in vitro reconstitution of NFAT complex with pre-existing NFAT components in unstimulated B and T cells ( 9 ) .
To examine whether NFATe. $ exhibits similar properties in cooperative binding with Fos and Jun , we compared the abilities of Fos/Jun heterodimers and Jun/Jun homodimers to reconstitute an NFAT complex with NFATc.B across a wide concentration range ( Fig .
5 ) .
NFAT complex assembly was efficiently detected at lower concentrations of Fos/Jun heterodimers than that of Jun/Jun homodimers .
Comparison of band intensities between NFAT complexes formed with Fos/Jun and Jun/Jun dimers indicated that the ability of Fos/Jun heterodimers to participate in the cooperative assem- 20917 © £ i ® co 30 $ € © Eo g @ Po= = 80 _o g % o s f 2 J © _s 2 E 8 5 & 8 E Probe 7.5 we » a1- -..

A Northern blot with 2 pg of poly ( A ) ® RNA from different human tissues was hybridized with a probe derived from a common sequence of NFATc.a and NFATe.8 ( top panel ) .
After stripping , the same blot was rehybridized with an unique probe ( middle panel ) , and subsequently with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G3PDH ) cDNA probe to quantitate amounts of RNA loaded per lane ( bottom panel ) .
The positions of size markers are indicated on the left .
bly of NFAT complexes was higher by at least 10-fold ( data not shown ) .
CsA-sensitive Activation of IL-2 NFAT Site-dependent Transcription by NFATc.B-Since NFATc.B was capable of binding to the IL-2 promoter NFAT site , we investigated its transactivation potential in transient transfection assays .
An NFATc.B , NFATp , or a control expression vector was cotransfected into Jurkat cells with a reporter gene ( CAT ) construct containing three IL-2 NFAT sites upstream of a minimal y-fibrinogen promoter , and the ability to activate NFAT-dependent transcription was tested with various combinations of PMA and ionomycin treatments ( Fig .
6 ) .
In control transfection , treatment of the cells with PMA plus ionomycin strongly induced CAT expression by endogenous NFAT activity in Jurkat cells , and the induction was inhibited by CsA .
Transfection of the NFATe.B expression vector resulted in approximately 2-fold additional induction of CAT activity , and more importantly , the induction was also completely blocked by CsA .
Treatment of the cells with either PMA or ionomycin alone failed to activate the IL-2 NFAT-dependent transcription .
NFATp transfection , used here as a positive control , also led to additional induction of CAT activity by approximately 2.3-fold .
Thus , these results indicate that transcriptional activation of the IL-2 NFAT/CAT reporter construct by NFATe.f in Jurkat cells was strictly regulated by the mechanisms which control endogenous NFAT activity , and that was also sensitive to CsA .
Lack of DNA Binding to the TNF-a « 3 Element and Activation of the TNF- « Promoter by NFATc.B-It has been well established that TNF-a expression was induced in primary B cells as well as in numerous B cell lines by various cellular stimuli ( 34 , 41 , 42 ) .
Rapid induction of TNF-a transcription by anti-Ig was blocked by CsA and FK506 in B cells ( 34 ) .

Generation of recombinant NFATc.§6 deletion mutants and their sequence-specific DNA binding to the IL-2 NFAT site .
A , schematic representation of deletion mutants of and NFATp peptides used for DNA binding .
Three deletion derivatives of were generated as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
The numbers refer to the amino acids present in the recombinant proteins .
B , purified deletion derivatives of NFATc.6 and NFATp .
Recombinant proteins tagged with a hexahistidine at the NH , terminus were expressed in E. coli , and purified using Ni-chelate resin as de Transcription Factor NFAT Gene Family element in the TNF-a promoter was shown to be responsible for the CsA-sensitive induction of this gene , and NFATp was shown to bind to this element without AP-1 proteins , suggesting that NFATp is involved in TNF-a production ( 17 , 35 , 43 ) .
Since the NFATe.B rel similarity domain is closely related to that of NFATp and was cloned from B cells , we tested whether it could bind to the « 3 element ( Fig .
7 ) .
Consistent with previous results ( 35 ) , NFATp binding to the « 3 element gave rise to two strong NFATp-DNA complexes ; binding of one or two NFATp molecules is thought to give rise to lower and upper complexes , respectively ( top panel , lanes 10-12 ) .
Significantly , all three recombinant derivatives of NFATe.B were unable to bind to the same site ( lanes 1-9 ) .
However , both NFATp and NFATe.B recombinant proteins showed relatively comparable binding affinities to the human IL-2 NFAT site ( bottom panel ) .
A wide range of poly ( dI-dC ) concentrations ( 0-1 ug/reaction ) did not change binding specificities of the recombinant proteins to the « 3 element ( data not shown ) , indicating that inability of NFATc.8 deletion derivatives to bind to this site is not due to a high concentration of nonspecific competitor poly ( dI-dC ) used in this experiment .
Thus , these results demonstrate that NFATe.B and NFATp exhibit differences in binding specificities to the TNF-a « 3 element .
To further confirm whether NFATe.8 is indeed non-functional in in vivo activation of the TNF-a promoter , we cotransfected either NFATc.f or NFATp expression plasmid with a TNF-a promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid into Jurkat T and Raji B cells , and tested their ability to activate the TNF- @ promoter ( Fig .
8 ) .
In control transfection of Jurkat T cells , luciferase activity was induced by about 25-fold upon stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin , and the induction was inhibited by CsA ( Fig .
8A ) , indicating that activation of the TNF-a promoter is sensitive to CsA as previously shown ( 17 ) .
Cotransfection with an NFATp expression plasmid further increased luciferase activity up to 150-fold in a CsA-sensitive manner .
However , NFATe.B transfection did not show any additional induction of luciferase activity ( Fig .
8A ) .
Similar results were observed in transient transfection assays with Raji B cells ( Fig .
8B ) .
Treatment of Raji cells with PMA and ionomycin led to 2-fold induction of TNF-a promoter-driven luciferase activity in the control transfection .
It is important to point out that the low levels of net induction of luciferase activity by stimulation appears to be due to strong constitutive activity of the TNF- @ promoter in Raji cells .
In the absence of stimulation , TNF- « promoter-driven luciferase activity in Raji cells was higher by approximately 7-fold than that of Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
These data agree with the observations of Goldfeld et al .
( 42 ) who showed that TNF-a mRNA was constitutively expressed in Raji cells which could be further enhanced by PMA treatment of cells .
NFATp expression increased luciferase activity about 5-fold without stimulation , and simulation with PMA and ionomycin resulted in additional induction of luciferase activity which was blocked by CsA .
Like Jurkat T cells , NFATc.B was unable to activate the TNF-a promoter in Raji B cells .
It is unlikely that lack of additional induction of luciferase activity scribed under `` Materials and Methods . ''

NFATe.6 binds the IL-2 NFAT site , but not the TNF-a 3 element .
Increasing amounts of three NFAT .
deletion derivatives or an NFAT p polypeptide containing the rel similarity domain were mixed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the TNF-a « 3 element ( top panel ) or the human IL-2 NFAT binding site ( bottom panel ) in DNA binding reactions .
Protein amounts of indicated peptides were increased by 10-fold ratio in each lane starting with 1.3 nM .
In electrophoretic mobility shift assay for IL-2 NFAT binding , 200 nM Fos/Jun heterodimers were used .
The Fos/Jun binding to the IL-2 NFAT site ( bottom panel ) , compared to a weak binding in Fig .

Taken together , these data indicate that NFATc.8 is not involved in transcriptional induction of the TNF-a gene , and further suggest that distinct members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate different NFAT cis-acting elements located in the promoters of cytokine genes .
DISCUSSION Several studies have demonstrated existence of a single or multiple NFAT binding sites in the regulatory regions of several cytokine genes including IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , granulo-cyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and TNF-a ( 11-17 ; reviewed in Ref .
2 ) .
These cytokines are distinctly expressed by both Th1 and Th2 cells ( 15 ) , and non-T immune cells also produce some of these cytokines in a CsA-sensitive manner ( 30 , 31 , 34 ) .
Several structurally related NFAT family proteins have recently been identified and characterized .
This raises an intriguing question regarding the roles of multiple NFAT proteins in the expression of cytokine genes .
In the present study , we report the existence of a new NFAT protein which might be a product of alternative splicing and/or differential promoter usage in the gene for the previously identified member NFATc ( NFATc.a ) .
Furthermore , our study provides evidence that this new NFAT protein does not participate in transcriptional induction of TNF-a , while it still activates the IL-2 NFAT-medi-ated transcription in a CsA-sensitive manner .
The new isoform NFATc.B resembles NFAT ' c. « in that it has an identical rel similarity region and its entire region except the first 29 amino acids which exhibit a high acidic amino acid content .
On the other hand , the corresponding region of NFATc.a contains only 3 acidic amino acids out of 42 residues , and displays no significant sequence similarity to the NFATc.6 NH , terminus .
In this regard , a deletion mutant of NFAT ' c.a containing the NH , -terminal region ( amino acids 1 to 418 upstream of rel similarity domain ) has been previously shown to display a dominant negative effect on the IL-2 NFAT 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 20920 A Jurkat 200 > E 150 3 Fe © ® $ 100 $ ' o hel _ ] $ 0 s- < % _| P+L P+ P+IL P+I - PiL PH | +CsA Po +CsA Pol +CsA [ Control NFATc.B NFATp Transcription Factor NFAT Gene Family B Raji 15 2 .s 0 10 -I < C © Pr C ko 2 ' o 3 21005 ® .2 s © CC 0 - P+ P+ P+IL PH P+L PHI +CsA +CsA +CsA L 1 | 1 1 I Control NFATo.8 NFATp Fig .

NFATe.§ fails to activate the TNF-a promoter .
A TNF-a promoter-luciferase plasmid was transiently cotransfected into Jurkat T and Raji B cells with either NFATe.6 or NFATp expression plasmid as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
At 24 h after transfection , cells were either untreated ( minus ) or treated with 50 ng/ml PMA plus 1.5 um ionomycin ( P+Z ) or PMA plus ionomycin plus cyclosporin A for additional 8 h as indicated .
NFATp transfection was done to ensure the integrity of the experimental system .
Control transfections were performed with empty expression vectors .
Luciferase activity was normalized with hGH values .

dependent transcription ( 19 ) .
Thus , it will be interesting to elucidate whether the 29-amino acid substitution with high acidic content will impart any functional differences .
Another distinct region of NFATc .
lies in the additional 142 amino acids downstream from the rel similarity domain which is missing in NFATe. « .
A comparison of primary sequences of all NFAT family members except NFATc. « reveals that they form a tripartite structure consisting of the well conserved rel similarity domain , the moderately conserved NH , terminus , and the COOH terminus with no significant sequence homol-ogy ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , NFATc .
86 appears to resemble more closely other members of the NFAT family in its primary structure than NFATe. « .
The rel similarity domain is sufficient for DNA binding and cooperative interactions with AP-1 proteins ( 21 , 36 ) , and the NH , terminus containing the conserved SP repeat motifs is thought to be involved in other common function ( s ) such as transcription activation and/or regulation of nuclear translocation ( 21 ) .
In contrast , the significance of COOH-terminal regions of these molecules remains poorly understood .
The extended COOH-terminal region does not display any significant sequence similarity among the family members , and we could not discern any significant differences in DNA binding abilities of NFATc.§ deletion derivatives in this region at least to NFAT-binding sites in the IL-2 and TNF-a promoters ( Fig .
5 ) .
However , it is possible that this region may be involved in regulation of activity of NFAT proteins by interacting with other transcription factors or by influencing half-life of NFAT proteins .
Further experiments will delineate the exact function of this region .
The two isoforms , NFATc. « and NFATe.B , could also be distinguished by their respective mRNAs .
Northern blots containing poly ( A ) RNA from numerous human tissues always showed two mRNA species with the sizes of 2.7 and 4.5 kb when hybridized with a probe derived from common sequences of NFATc. « and NFATe.f .
On the other hand , an NFATc.f-unique probe detected only the 4.5-kb mRNA ( Fig .
3 ) .
Interestingly , the expression profile of both mRNAs in multiple human tissues was distinct .
Although both mRNAs were expressed in various tissues , NFAT ' c. « mRNA was predominantly expressed in the thymus and peripheral leukocytes enriched in T cells , whereas NFATc .
B mRNA was a major species in the spleen and non-immune tissues .
Since splenic cells consist of enriched B cell population , it is tempting to speculate that B cells are a major contributor to NFATc.B mRNA in the spleen .
Failure to detect NFAT ' c.8 mRNA in peripheral leukocytes may be due to a low number of B cells ( 7-10 % ) contributing to a poor hybridizing signal .
Further experiments to examine cell type-specific NFATc.B expression are currently under way .
Significantly , our present data demonstrate that NFATe.B was unable to bind to the TNF-a « 3 element to which NFATp strongly bound ( Fig .
7 ) .
Furthermore , transient transfection assays indicate that indeed was non-functional in in vivo activation of the TNF-a promoter ( Fig .
8 ) .
Thus , these findings strongly suggest that distinct NFAT proteins may play a role in regulation of different cytokine gene expression , although there is some functional redundancy in transcriptional activation of a certain cytokine gene such as IL-2 .
In fact , NFAT sites in the regulatory regions of different cytokine genes display some divergence in their sequence and properties to interact with other transcription factors ( reviewed in Ref .
2 ) .
Many NFAT protein-binding sites are flanked by a cryptic AP-1 site , while some others such as those in the IL-4 and TNF- @ promoters are adjacent to binding sites for other transcription factors such as Oct and ATF/Jun , respectively ( 13 , 44 ) .
Partic-ularly , TNF-a « 3 element is considerably divergent in sequence from other NFAT sites and resembles an NF-KB site .
This site is occupied by two molecules of NFATp that appear to form a functional dimer for the transcriptional activation of the TNF-a gene ( 35 ) .
Moreover , NFAT p molecules bound to the « 3 element have been shown to functionally cooperate with ATF/Jun proteins in immediate early induction of TNF-a gene transcription ( 44 ) .
Therefore , mutually exclusive regulation of cell type-specific lymphokine production may involve recruitment of distinct NFAT family members as well as sequential or combina-torial participation of different NFAT proteins and other transcription factors .

1 : We recently noticed that the published NFATc.B sequence contains errors at two nucleotide positions , i.e .
the lack of one C at position 2334 and the lack of one G at position 2451 .
This is due to an error which occurred during preparation of Fig .
1 from alignment of partial overlapping sequences .
The corrected sequence showing an additional C at position 2334 and an additional G at position 2451 as well as the corresponding amino acid changes have been deposited in GenBank '' with the accession number U59736 .
