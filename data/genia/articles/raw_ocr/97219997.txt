NFATx1 , which is preferentially expressed in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes , is one of four members of the NFAT family of transcription factors .
We have performed domain analysis of NFATx1 by examining the effects of deletion mutations .
We found that NFAT'x1 DNA binding activity and interaction with AP-1 polypeptides were dependent on its central Rel similarity region and that transcriptional activation was reduced by deletions of either its N-terminal domain or its C-terminal domain , suggesting the presence of intrinsic transcriptional activation motifs in both regions .
We also identified a potent inhibitory sequence within its N-terminal domain .
We show that the inactivation of the inhibition was dependent on the activity of calcineurin , a calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase .
We also show that calcineurin associated with the N-terminal domain of NFATx1 at multiple docking sites and caused a reduction of size , indicative of dephosphorylation , in NFATx1 .
We have mapped the inhibitory activity to less than 60 residues , containing motifs that are conserved in all NFAT proteins .
Finally , we demonstrate that deletion in NFATx1 of the mapped 60 residues leads to its nuclear translocation independent of calcium signaling .
Our results support the model proposing that the N-terminal domain confers calcium-signaling dependence on NFATx1 transactivation activity by regulating its intracellular localization through a protein module that associates with calcineurin and is a target of its phosphatase activity .
T cells become activated when they recognize peptides derived from foreign antigens in the context of antigen-present-ing cells .
Activated T cells then produce and secrete a plethora of cytokines , which are largely responsible for initiating and coordinating effective immune responses ( 1 , 23 , 25 ) .
The induction of cytokine gene expression and other downstream signaling events that occur during T-cell activation involve at least two distinct signaling pathways , since the combined action of calcium ionophores and phorbol esters can mimic these responses ( 6 , 28 ) .
The calcium-dependent pathway is of particular interest because it is this pathway that is blocked by the action of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( 6 ) .
These drugs combine with immunophilins and prevent cytokine gene expression by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of calmodulin-dependent calcineurin ( 6 ) .
The nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) regulates induction of cytokine gene expression in T cells through cis-acting elements located in the promoters of several cytokine genes ( 6 , 20 , 27 ) .
NFAT is a multimeric complex whose components clarify , in part , the dual signaling requirements for induction of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene and other cytokine genes ( 6 , 13 ) .
Transcription dependent on the distal NFAT-binding site from the IL-2 promoter , for example , requires the action of both phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium * Corresponding author .

The PMA requirement is primarily for the induction of the AP-1 heterodimers , and the calcium mobilization requirement is to activate preexisting cytoplasmic NFAT proteins ( 6 , 27 ) .
To date , four members of the NFAT family of transcription factors have been reported : NFATI/NFATp , NFATc , NFAT3 , and NFATx/NFAT4/NFATe3 ( 9 , 10 , 21 , 22 , 24 ) .
NFAT proteins are characterized by a highly homologous DNA-binding domain , which is weakly related to the DNA-binding domains of Rel family proteins ( 10 , 21 , 24 ) .
The high degree of similarity is manifested by the fact that all members are capable of binding and transactivating through the same IL-2 NFAT-binding site ( 10 , 21 , 22 , 24 ) .
Another feature of NFAT proteins , perhaps even more distinctive , is a unique domain with moderate homology in their N termini preceding their DNA-binding domains .
This domain contains several conserved motifs ( 9 , 10 , 16 , 21 ) , most of which are collectively encompassed by a ~300-residue region termed the NFAT homology region ( NHR ) ( 16 ) .
The C-terminal domains of NFAT proteins exhibit little homology .
The mechanism for calcium-dependent activation of NFAT proteins is under investigation .
Recent work on NFAT1 regulation has shown that as calcium is mobilized , calcineurin is activated and binds NFAT1 ( 15 , 37 ) .
Calcineurin then dephosphorylates NFAT1 ( 30 , 32 ) , resulting in its nuclear translocation ( 30 , 32 ) and activation of its DNA binding activity ( 26 ) .
Here we report a domain analysis of NFATx1 , a splice variant of NFAT ' x that is predominantly expressed in the thymus ( 21 ) .
We show the domains in NFATx1 involved in its DNA Vor .

We also report the characterization of a potent inhibitory region in the N terminus of NFATx1 that is regulated by the serine/threonine calcineurin phosphatase .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
Jurkat ( clone E6-1 ) cells and 293T ( 293tsA1609neo ) cells , a 293 subline stably transfected with the simian virus 40 T antigen ( 7 ) , were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , Md .
Cells were grown at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO ; .
293T and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium , and Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium , both supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 4 mM 1-glutamine , 100 U of penicillin per ml , and 100 mg of streptomycin per ml .
Plasmids .
pME-NFATx ( hereafter referred to as pME-NFATx1 ) and pME-NFATe are expression plasmids for NFATx1 and NFATc cDNAs under the control of the SRa promoter in vector pME18S and have been described previously ( 21 ) .
Plasmids containing deletions in NFATx1 were constructed from pME-NFATx1 by using standard recombinant DNA techniques ( 2 ) .
DNA fragments were deleted by using suitable restriction enzymes ; when necessary , digested ends were filled in with Klenow fragment to ensure in-frame constructions upon ligation and transformation .
At least two independent clones for each construct were selected , characterized , and used for transfection experiments .
Junction nucleotide sequences in constructs were verified by DNA sequencing .
pME-XAC contains a deletion that includes the sequences encoding the carboxy terminus and 308 bp of 3 ' untranslated sequence .
pME-XARC and pME-XANC also lack the same 308 bp of 3 ' untranslated sequence in addition to sequences indicated in Fig .
2A .
pME-XAGT was constructed by replacing a 493-bp frag-ment , excised with Xbal and BseAI from pME-NFATx1 , with a 325-bp fragment obtained from a PCR product that had been digested with Xbel and BseAL The PCR was performed using Pf DNA polymerase ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) with pME-NFATx1 as the template DNA and the following oligonucleotides as primers : 5-GCTCTAGAACCCTTGGATCCCCTCTGACTTCT-3 ' and 5'-AG CATTGAGCCACGTATCTTCTG-3 ' .
pNFAT72Luc was obtained from Lisako Tsuruta ( University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan ) and contains the reporter luciferase gene under the control of three copies of the murine distal NFAT site ( -290 to -261 ) ( 11 ) .
pCMV-SEAP ( Tropix , Bedford , Mass . )
is an expression vector of secreted alkaline phosphatase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promot-er/enhancer .
pBJ5-CNA and pBJ5-CNB , kindly provided by N. A. Clipstone and G. Crabtree ( Stanford University , Stanford , Calif. ) , contain murine cDNAs for the Aal and B subunits , respectively , under the control of the SRa promoter ( 5 ) .
Transfection and luciferase assays .
Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with minimal modifications ( 2 ) .
Briefly , 5 X 10° cells were rinsed with 1 % STBS buffer ( 25 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 7.4 ] , 137 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCI , 0.6 mM Na ; HPO , , 0.7 mM CaC ) ; , 0.5 mM MgCl ; ) .
The cells were then resuspended in 750 pl of DEAE-dextran ( 500 pg/ml ! )
in 1 % STBS containing plasmid DNA ( 13 to 21 pg ) and left at room temperature for 25 min .
Next , 10 ml of 1 % STBS buffer was added to dilute the DEAE-dextran solution , and cells were collected and resuspended in fully complemented culture medium .
After approximately 40 h of incubation at 37°C , cells were stimulated for 8 h and supernatants and cell pellets were collected for subsequent enzymatic assays .
In all transfections , pCMV-SEAP ( 2.5 ug ) was included to monitor for transfection efficiency .
Secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in supernatants of PMA-stim-ulated cells was measured in duplicate by a luminometer , using the Phospha-light assay system ( Tropix ) .
Luciferase in cell lysates was measured in duplicate by a luminometer , using a luciferase assay system ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
Protein concentration was measured by using bicinchoninic acid ( Pierce , Rockford , 111 . )
as indicated by the supplier .
COS-7 cell transfection , Western blotting , and DNA binding .
COS-7 cell transfections by the DEAE-dextran method and cytosolic extract preparations were carried out as described previously ( 21 , 36 ) .
Cytosolic extracts were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( 4 to 12 % gels ) followed by Western blotting using an antiserum raised against the peptide GAHDELDFKLVFGEDGA ( amino acids 7 to 23 of NFATx ) .
The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amer-sham , Arlington Heights , III . ) .
DNA binding activity in the cytosolic extracts was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , using partially purified AP-1 from Jurkat cells as described previously ( 21 ) .
Metabolic labeling of cells and immunoprecipitation .
293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method ( 2 ) .
Transfections were done in 100-mm-diameter dishes , using a maximum of 30 pg of total plasmid DNA in DNA-HEPES-buffered saline solution .
Approximately 12 h later , the media was exchanged with fresh culture medium .
Forty hours posttransfection , the cells were metabolically labeled with 500 wCi of Pro-mix ( Amersham ) , an amino acid mixture containing and [ **SJeysteine , per 100-mm-diameter dish in methionine-free Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium for 4 h. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM HEPES [ pH 7.0 ] , 10 wM CaC ) ; , 0.25 % Nonidet P-40 , 10 ug of leupeptin per ml , 10 ug of aprotinin per ml , 10 pg of Pefabloc per ml , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 10 mM NaF , 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate ) .
Immunoprecipitations were performed as described by Harlow et al .
( 8 ) and resolved on SDS-8 to 16 % polyacrylamide DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF AN NFAT TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR - 2067 gels .
For immunoprecipitations , we used the rabbit antiserum ( « -DS ) raised against a bacterially produced recombinant peptide ( residues 387 to 728 ) of human NFATx ( 14 ) or a rabbit antiserum raised against murine calcineurin B ( CNB ) ( Affinity Bioreagents , Golden , Colo. ) .
Immunofluorescence staining .
NFATx1 and XAGT were visualized by immunofluorescence staining as reported by Liu et al .
( 14 ) .
Transfected COS-7 cells were either nonstimulated or stimulated with A23187 ( 0.5 M ) for 30 min , and the cells were fixed with 3.7 % formaldehyde at room temperature .
NFATx1 and XAGT were stained with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody « -DS .
The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit immuno-globulin G ( Zymed , South San Francisco , Calif. ) .
RESULTS Construction of NFATx1 deletion mutants .
Based on degrees of similarity , NFAT proteins were divided into three main domains ( Fig .
1A ) .
The first , the N-terminal domain , comprises approximately 400 amino acids exhibiting modest similarity ( 23 to 35 % identity ) with patches of homology that represent nine conserved motifs ( Fig .
1B ) ( 9 , 10 , 21 ) .
The sequence encompassing the nine motifs has been referred to as the NHR ( 16 ) and includes three copies of the conserved SP box motif , SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX ( D , E ) ( D , E ) ( 21 ) .
The sec-ond , central domain , of about 300 residues , exhibits the highest similarity ( 66 to 73 % identity ) within NFAT sequences .
This domain , referred to as the Rel similarity domain ( RSD ) , is weakly similar to the DNA-binding domains of the Rel family of transcription factors ( 10 , 12 , 21 , 24 ) .
The third , the C-terminal domain , of 250 to 350 residues , exhibits little similarity within NFAT proteins , except for a 15-amino-acid sequence that is present in at least one splice variant for each NFAT protein ( 11 ) .
In view of their clear demarcations , we assumed that each domain constituted structurally independent folds and decided to investigate their function by constructing a series of expression plasmids of NFAT'x1 lacking one or two domains ( Fig .
2A ) .
All constructs derived from pME-NFAT'x1 ( 21 ) , thus ensuring the use of the same transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences .
Expression of the deleted constructs was confirmed by Western blot analysis .
A blot of lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with the different plasmids was probed with a rabbit antiserum raised against a 17-amino-acid peptide ( GA HDELDFKLVFGEDGA ) present in the amino terminus of NFAT'x1 ( Fig .
2B ) .
A unique band for each construct was detected in each lane .
In some lanes , additional bands of higher mobility were observed ( Fig .
2B ) .
These bands were not reproducible and were probably degradation products of the corresponding lower-mobility bands .
The bands appearing in lysates from mock-transfected cells were nonspecific bands detected by the antisera .
NFATx1 DNA binding activity is dependent on the RSD .
We then tested the different mutant constructs for DNA binding to the distal NFAT -binding site of the human IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
2C ) .
We previously showed that NFATx1 binding to the human NFAT-binding site required the presence of AP-1 ( 21 ) .
Thus , EMSAs using cytosolic extracts of COS -transfected cells were carried out in the presence of exogenously added AP-1 .
For comparison , we also included EMSAs with cytosolic extracts from cells that were transfected with the empty vector pME18S ( mock ) or with an expression plasmid of NFAT , an NFAT member which lacks most of the carboxy-terminus domain ( 24 ) .
The results indicate that , as for NFAT1 ( 12 , 22 ) , the RSD of NFATx1 contained the sequences responsible for DNA binding and AP-1 interaction .
The smallest mutant able to bind the NFAT binding site was XANC , which contained an intact RSD ( Fig .
2C , lane 8 ) .
Conversely , XARC and XANR , which lacked the RSD , were unable to bind DNA ( Fig .
2C , lanes 7 and 9 ) .

Effects of NFATx1 and deletion mutants on transcription driven by NFAT sites in Jurkat cells .
We next checked the effects of NFATx1 and its deletions on transactivation activity elicited through NFAT -binding sites in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Either vector pME18S or the various NFAT'x1 expression plasmids were transfected along with reporter plasmid pNFAT72Luc , which contains the luciferase gene under the control of three copies of the murine IL-2 distal NFAT site .
Consistent with previous reports ( 31 ) , the luciferase activity of mock-transfected cells representing endogenous NFAT activity was dependent on stimulation with both phorbol ester ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) .
Likewise , this NFAT activity was completely blocked by the action of CsA ( Fig .
3A ) .
Overex-pression of NFAT'x1 increased luciferase activity by about 15 Vor .

fold over endogenous activity ; again , this activity was completely dependent on both PMA and A23187 stimulation and was sensitive to CsA action .
This dependency is analogous to NFAT1 activity ( 16 ) but contrary to what has been reported for NFATce , which appeared to bypass the calcium signaling requirement ( 24 ) .
In our hands , however , addition of human NFAT led to a modest luciferase activity when activated with PMA alone ( Fig .
3 ) .
Deletion of any domain reduced the PMA-A23187-induced transactivation activity of NFATx1 ( Fig .
3A ) , indicating the presence of sequences which are needed for full transactivation activity in both N-terminal and C-terminal domains .
The decrease in transactivation activity could be caused by deletion of intrinsic transactivation domains or by structural defects affecting transcriptional activation , directly or indirectly .
Evi-dently , XARC and XANR , by virtue of their inability to bind NFAT sites , were unable to activate transcription ( Fig .
3A ) .
Interestingly , contrary to what was found for full-length NFATx1 , transfection of pME-XAN led to substantial luciferase activity when cells were stimulated with PMA only ( Fig .
3B ) .
This PMA-induced activity was equivalent to endogenous NFAT activity when cells were stimulated with the combination PMA-A23187 .
Moreover , this XAN-directed activity was insensitive to the action of CsA ( Fig .

sequence that is regulated by a calcium-calcineurin-dependent pathway .
Despite being substantial , the PMA-only activity elicited by XAN corresponded to about a third of that activity stimulated with PMA-A23187 ( Fig .
3A ) .
This effect suggests that calcium mobilization affects additional pathways besides the inactivation of the inhibitory sequence .
If this is the case , the pathways appear to be mediated by calcineurin as well , since addition of CsA inhibited the extra activity ( Fig .
3A ) .
Alternatively , it is possible that the inhibitory activity had only been partially deleted and that further deletions would lead to an activity completely independent of calcium signaling .
Finally , it should be noted that the PMA-only transactivation activity of XAN was dependent on the C-terminal domain , since a deletion of this domain abolished all the activity ( com-pare XAN with XANC in Fig .
3B ) .
This results reinforces the idea that the C-terminal domain contains an intrinsic transactivation domain .
Mobility shift of NFATx1 in SDS-PAGE is associated with the N-terminal domain .
A peculiar feature of NFATx1 was observed in the Western blot in Fig .
2B .
NFATx1 when expressed in COS-7 cells ran in SDS-PAGE at a mobility that was lower than expected from its deduced molecular mass ( Fig .
2B ; Table 1 ) .
NFATx1 had an apparent molecular mass of 137 kDa , which is about 20 kDa higher than its deduced molecular mass .
The same discrepancy was observed for NFATx1 when expressed in 293T cells or Jurkat cells ( 19 ) .
This property is not unique to NFATx1 , as it has been observed with NFAT1 and NFATc proteins ( 24 , 30 , 32 ) .
In these cases , it has been postulated that the size shift is due to phosphorylation events ( 30 , 32 ) .
% nterestingly , the size discrepancy was not observed for 2070 MASUDA ET AL .

Thus , these results demonstrate that sequences within the N-terminal domain were responsible for the mobility shift of NFATx1 in SDS-PAGE and were likely sites of phosphorylation .
The N-terminal domain of NFATxl interacts with calcineurin .
Recently , direct interactions between calcineurin and NFAT1 have been reported ( 15 , 37 ) .
In view of the fact that the inhibitory region was regulated by calcineurin and that NFAT proteins had some similarities , we tested whether NFAT'x1 could also associate with calcineurin ( Fig .
4 ) .
To determine the interaction , we cotransfected 293T cells with expression plasmids of NFATx1 along with expression plasmids of calcineurin A ( CNA ) and CNB or empty vector .
The transfected cells were then metabolically labeled with [ **S ) Jme-thionine and [ *S Jcysteine , and their whole-cell lysates containing 10 wM CaCl , were used for immunoprecipitation experiments .
An antiserum raised against the RSD of human NFAT'x1 ( « -DS $ ) specifically immunoprecipitated a band of 137 kDa from lysates derived from NFATx1-transfected cells ( Fig .

Western analyses confirmed that the 137-kDa band corresponded to NFATx1 ( 19 ) .

4A , lane 3 ) .
Conversely , an antiserum raised against murine CNB ( « -CNB ) was able to coimmunoprecipitate CNB with CNA and NFAT'x1 ( Fig .
4B , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
These results indicated that NFAT'x1 , like NFAT1 , closely associated with calcineurin .
Two other bands of ~29 and ~19 kDa of unknown identity also coimmunoprecipitated with NFATx1 ( Fig .
4A , lane 3 ) .
These bands were also present in lysates from CNA- and CNB-transfected cells when immunoprecipitated with « -CNB antiserum ( Fig .
4B , lane 1 ) , suggesting that these proteins coimmunoprecipitated with NFATx1 through their association with calcineurin .
Their function in the multimeric NFATxl-cal-cineurin complex awaits further characterization .
It is also possible that these bands represent degradation products or modified peptides deriving from pBJS5-CNA and pBJS-CNB .
However , they were not detected by Western blotting experiments with various anticalcineurin antisera ( 19 ) .
We next checked whether XAN , which could drive transcription without calcineurin activity , could also bind calcineurin .
In sharp contrast to NFAT'x1 , XAN failed to be coimmunoprecipitated with calcineurin in assays using either « -DS or a « -CNB antiserum ( Fig .
4 ) .
These results indicate that calcineurin bound NFATx1 via its amino-terminus domain and are consistent with results of transfection experiments that suggested the N-terminal domain of NFAT'x1 was a target for calcineurin action .
Importantly , the NFAT'x1 interaction with calcineurin was accompanied by a mobility shift of NFATx1 in SDS-PAGE , indicating a change in molecular size from 137 to 120 kDa ( Fig .
4 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Once again , the mobility shift was absent when XAN was used instead of NFATx1 , reinforcing the idea that the shift was caused by calcineurin action on the N-terminal domain .
Thus , these results strongly support the idea that the mobility shift is dependent on the dephosphorylation of residues present in the N-terminal domain .
Calcineurin , a phosphoserine/threonine phosphatase , would have several potential target residues since serine is the most abundant amino acid in the N-terminal domain ( 67 of 418 residues ) .
Taken together , the foregoing results suggest that the dependency of NFATx1 activity on calcium signaling is mediated by an inhibitory sequence located in its N terminus .
Hereafter , we will refer to this sequence conferring calcineurin-regulated inhibition as the CRI sequence .
The results show that calcineurin binds to the N terminus of NFATx1 and deactivates the inhibitory activity of the CRI sequence , allowing NFATx1 to become transcriptionally active .
Mapping of the CRI sequence in NFATx1 .
We next tried to map the residues responsible for the CRI activity .
For this purpose , we made a series of plasmids containing further deletions within the N-terminal domain of NFAT'x1 and used the PMA-only transactivation activity in Jurkat cells as an assay ( Fig .
5 ) .
First , the deletion in XAN was divided into XAXX and XAXM ( Fig .
5A ) , the results clearly indicating that the CRI sequence was present in XAXM ( Fig .
5B ) .
Next , the deletion in XAXM was divided into XAXB and XABM ( Fig .
5A ) .
Interestingly , transfection of pME-XAXB resulted in even higher PMA-induced activity .
On the other hand , XABM was unable to induce any transactivation by PM alone ( Fig .
5B ) .
XAXB contains a deletion that included the three previously recognized SP boxes ( 21 ) in addition to 60 residues preceding them .
Thus , the deletion in XAXB was divided into XABB and XAGT ( Fig .
5A ) .
Unmistakably , deletion of the 60 amino acids Vor .

3. preceding the SP boxes in XAGT resulted in PMA-induced activity , while deletion of the SP boxes in XABB did not ( Fig .
5B ) .
These results indicate that deletion of at least 60 residues was sufficient for inactivating the inhibitory activity conferred by the CRI sequence .
Comparison of the 60 residues deleted in XAGT to analogous sequences of other NFAT proteins shows that this sequence has been only loosely conserved ( Fig .
1B ) .
The first 40 residues are weakly conserved in all NFAT proteins centered around two motifs : YR ( E , D ) and SSXSSXSXXS ( D , E ) .
In NFAT3 , an additional octapeptide has been inserted between the two motifs .
These 40 residues closely corresponded to the A box , which was reported by Hoey et al .
( 10 ) to be conserved between NFATc and NFAT ' x .
The 20 amino acids at the carboxy end of the 60-residue peptide are absent or partially absent in NFAT1 and NFATc but are nicely conserved between NFATx1 and NFAT3 ( Fig .
1B ) .
It will be interesting to see whether these sequences play similar roles in their respective NFAT contexts .
Strikingly , the deletion in XAGT caused no adverse effect on transactivation when cells were induced by the combination of DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF AN NFAT TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR - 2071 A A af “ ﬁx “ $ 5FF $ 513 '' p18 : we » +96 no , '' CNA+B = - $ - $ - $ - + -o + - +- +- + NFATx1 [ C.

PMA and A23187 ( Fig .
5B ) , indicating that CRI function could be separated from the effects on transactivation seen with XAN .
Supporting this idea is the fact that the converse was observed with XABM and XABB , which appeared to have little effect on CRI activity but affected PMA-A23187-induced transcriptional activity .
It should be noted that conclusions drawn from the XAXX construct are complicated because all transactivation activity was abolished .
Other constructs showed at least modest induction over endogenous NFAT activity ( Fig .
5 ) .
The mutant XAXX protein could be detected and was therefore being expressed ( 19 ) .
However , it is possible that the XAXX struc-ture , and therefore its function , was defective and thus compromised much of its transactivation activity .
Multiple docking sites for calcineurin in the N terminus of NFATx1 .
We next performed immunoprecipitation experiments with the N-terminus deletions to investigate whether sequences affecting CRI function correlated with calcineurin binding ( Fig .
6 ) .
To ensure that the amounts of calcineurin in lysates were identical from experiment to experiment , we slightly modified the experimental protocol whereby equal amounts of the lysate from 293T cells transfected with pBJ5-CNA and pBJ5-CNB were mixed with lysates from 293T cells that had been separately transfected with pME-NFATx1 or its derivatives .
The results with NFATx1 and XAN ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1 to 4 ) were essentially identical to results depicted in Fig .
4A .
Remarkably , XAGT coimmunoprecipitated with calcineurin ( Fig .
6 , lane 16 ) .
This meant that calcineurin binding did not necessarily correlate with CRI function .
In other words , calcineurin binding was not sufficient to inactivate the inhibitory activity .
In fact , apart from XAN and XAXM , the deletion mutants were able to associate with calcineurin ( Fig .
6 ) .
A simple interpretation of these results , as far as calcineurin binding is concerned , is that calcineurin was capable of binding NFATx1 at different sites within the N-terminal domain of NFATx1 ; only when all the docking sites were deleted was calcineurin binding lost .
This finding again is supported by the observation that serine is the most abundant amino acid throughout this region , possibly providing multiple substrates and pseudosubstrates for calcineurin .
It is not known whether more than one calcineurin molecule binds NFATx1 at any one time .
Significantly , even though calcineurin bound to several of the mutant NFATx1 proteins , the calcineurin-induced shift of NFATx1 mobility in SDS-PAGE was not observed in all NFATx1 mutants ( Fig .
6 ) .
Specifically , a clear calcineurin-induced shift was observed in full-length NFATx1 , XAXX , and 2072 MASUDA ET AL .

Intracellular localization of recombinant NFATx1 and XAGT in COS-7 cells .
Cells were transfected with expression plasmids for NFATx1 ( A and B ) and XAGT ( C and D ) along with expression plasmids for CNA and CNB .
Transfected cells were either left unstimulated ( A and C ) or stimulated for 30 min with the calcium ionophore A23187 ( 0.5 uM ) ( B and D ) .
Recombinant proteins were visualized by immunofluorescence staining with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody « -DS , which recognizes the RSD of NFATx1 .
XABM ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 11 , and 12 ) ; on the other hand , the calcineurin-induced shift was reduced or absent in XAN , XAXM , XAXB , XABB , and XAGT ( Fig .
6 , lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 ) .
Except for XABB , the calcineurin-induced shift correlated with CRI activity seen in Fig .
5 .
That is , when sequences affecting CRI function were deleted , the calcineurin-induced shift in SDS-PAGE was reduced .
These results suggest that certain residues were susceptible to calcineurin phosphatase action , as could be observed by mobility shifts in SDS-PAGE , and that deletion of these residues lead to calcium-independent activation .
Collectively , the results indicate that calcineurin binds to the N terminus of NFAT'x1 at multiple sites and dephosphorylates residues in the CRI sequence , deactivating its inhibitory activity .
Intracellular localization of NFATx1 and XAGT .
To obtain further insight into the mechanism of the CRI activity , we then decided to examine the intracellular localization of NFATx1 and XAGT in transfected COS-7 cells .
Recently , we showed by immunostaining using affinity-purified « -DS antibodies that murine NFATx1 introduced into COS-7 cells localized predominantly to the cytoplasm ( 14 ) .
We also showed that endogenous calcineurin levels in our COS-7 cells were insufficient to drive efficient nuclear translocation of transfected murine NFATx1 ; only when CNA and CNB were also overexpressed by cotransfection did most of the murine NFAT'x1 translocate into the nucleus in response to calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) stimulation ( 14 ) .
We then transfected COS-7 cells with pME- NFATx1 or pME-XAGT along with expression plasmids for CNA and CNB and immunostained them by using « -DS antibodies ( Fig .
7 ) .
The results showed that , similar to murine NFAT'x1 , essentially all human NFATx1 ( > 95 % ) localized to the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
Moreover , induction of calcium mobilization by A23187 treatments resulted in nuclear localization of NFAT'x1 in about 85 % of the NFATx1-express-ing cells , showing that NFATx1 nuclear localization was dependent on calcium signaling .
On the other hand , XAGT localized to the nucleus in 70 to 80 % of nonstimulated COS-7 cells that expressed XAGT ( Fig .
7 ) .
A23187 treatments resulted in an increase of XAGT nuclear localization to over 90 % of -expressing cells .
These results demonstrate that an activity that normally retains NFAT'x1 in the cytoplasm was disrupted by the deletion in XAGT , thus providing one mechanism for the inhibitory activity conferred by the CRI sequence in NFAT'x1 .
DISCUSSION Based on sequence comparisons , we divided NFATx1 into three domains .
Our results confirmed that the RSD , located in the middle of NFATx , was responsible for DNA binding activity and for interactions with AP-1 polypeptides ( Fig .
2C ) .
This finding is consistent with results of assays using the DNA-binding domain of the NF-kB/Re !
protein family ( 3 ) and , more Vor .
17 , 1997 specifically , with analogous results of assays using the NFAT1 RSD ( 12 , 22 ) .
As for sequences in both the amino terminus and the carboxy terminus of NFAT ' x , our results indicated that they play important roles in the regulation and transactivation function of NFATx1 ( Fig .
3 ) .
In fact , recently we have identified a 15-amino-acid motif close to the carboxy end of NFAT'x1 that is responsible for transactivation activity in NFAT'x1 ( 11 ) .
This finding further supports the idea that a main role for the C terminus is to mediate transcriptional induction via its transactivation sequences .
The presence of a strong transactivation domain in the C terminus of NFATIC , a splice variant of NFAT1 , has also been recently reported ( 17 ) .
Interestingly , deletion of the amino-terminal domain also revealed that this region contained an inhibitory sequence that was regulated by calcium signaling ( Fig .
3 ) .
We refer to this sequence as the CRI sequence and its negative activity as CRI activity .
Thus , we showed that the CRI activity , which would be normally inactivated by calcium mobilization , could also be removed by specific deletions within the N terminus .
In the absence of CRI activity , as in an NFATx1 lacking the N terminus ( XAN ) , transcriptional activation did not require the calcium signaling pathway , and this transactivation was insensitive to the action of the calcineurin inhibitor CsA ( Fig .
3 ) .
Recent work on NFAT1 regulation has established that upon stimulation , calcineurin binds to the amino terminus region of NFAT1 , which is then dephosphorylated and subsequently translocated to the nucleus ( 18 , 30 , 32 ) .
Our present work involving the similarly regulated NFATx1 extends these observations .
We found not only that calcineurin bound the amino terminus of NFAT'x1 but that it did so by using multiple docking sites ( Fig .
6 ) .
Moreover , we also mapped the sequences ( positions 146 to 310 in Fig .
1B ) containing target residues of calcineurin activity , as shown by the reduced calcineurin-induced mobility shift of XAGT and XABB mutants ( Fig .
6 ) .
Our results also complement two other recent reports .
Shi-basaki et al .
( 33 ) showed that calcineurin bound the N terminus of NFAT4/x and was translocated into the nucleus in conjunction with NFAT4/x .
Our results are consistent with theirs and further show that calcineurin association to NFATx1 alone is insufficient to transmit the calcium-regulated signal , for it is the calcineurin-induced size shifts ( dephosphoryla-tions ) that appear to correlate with CRI function .
For example , of the several mutants that were able to bind calcineurin , only those with reduced calcineurin-induced shifts XAXB and XAGT bypassed calcium signaling ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) .
XABB appears to be an exception and will be discussed below .
Likewise , Luo et al .
( 17 ) showed that deletion of all of the N-terminal domain of NFAT1C , a splice variant of NFAT1 , resulted in transactivation induced by PMA alone .
They further showed , using fusions to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain , that the N-terminus sequence could be subdivided into two functional domains : a strong transactivation domain , contained in the first 100 residues ; and a region potently inhibiting transactivation , contained in the NHR of ~300 residues .
Again , our results are consistent .
We show a similar inhibitory sequence in the N terminus of NFAT'x1 .
Moreover , we have mapped this region to 60 residues just preceding the SP boxes ( Fig .
1B ) , showing that when it is deleted , the calcium dependence is partially bypassed ( Fig .
5B ) .
The mechanism for the calcium-regulated inhibition is complicated by the fact that three possible steps may be affected : nuclear translocation , DNA binding , and transactivation .
It is possible the CRI function affects one , two , or all three of these activities .
DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF AN NFAT TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR - 2073 The foregoing caveat notwithstanding , it is clear that nuclear translocation must occur before the other two activities become relevant .
Furthermore , it has been shown that NFAT translocates into the nucleus in a calcineurin-dependent manner ( 14 , 33 ) .
Our results here clearly showed that CRI , at minimum , regulates NFATx1 nuclear translocation .
Unlike NFATx1 , the deletion mutant XAGT containing a disrupted CRI function was able to localize to the nucleus independently of calcium signaling in COS-7 cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
There are two main nonexclusive models for the mechanism for the regulation of NFATx1 translocation .
One model is simply that the 60 residues adjacent to the SP boxes would impart retention in the cytoplasm to NFATx1 via specific pro-tein-protein interactions .
The phosphatase activity of calcineurin on some of the residues would then be required for the subsequent NFATx1 release .
In this respect , it will be interesting to examine the function of the YR ( E , D ) and SSXSSXSXXS ( D , E ) motifs present in the 60 residues ( Fig .
1B ) .
The concept for the alternative model is also facilitated by considering that it is likely that the CRI sequence constitutes a structural module , or part of it , that retains NFATx1 in the cytosol .
From sequence comparisons , it is pertinent to assume that the module could correlate to the NHR , which is conserved in all NFAT proteins ( Fig .
1 ) .
That is , CRI activity might require a span of ~300 residues instead of a few residues .
In this model , nuclear localization signals ( NLSs ) are being masked by amino acids in the CRI sequence .
As calcium is mobilized , calcineurin is activated and would bind to the amino terminus of NFAT'x1 .
Activated calcineurin would then dephosphorylate residues present in the CRI sequence , causing a structural change that would lead to the unmasking of NLSs .
NFATx1 would then go into the nucleus and activate gene expression in conjunction with PMA-induced AP-1 .
Similar versions of this model have been recently proposed ( 4 , 18 , 33 ) .
Indeed , detailed examination of the aligned NFAT sequences revealed basic conserved motifs flanking the SP box closest to the Rel domain ( Fig .
1 ) ( 16 ) that may function as NLSs .
In fact , one of these motifs , the RXXSPXXKRRXS motif , was recently shown to form part of a NLS by Luo et al .
( 18 ) .
Their amino acid substitutions of the KRR residues in this motif for AAA residues resulted in an NFAT1 unable to translocate into the nucleus upon stimulation .
The function of the other basic motif remains unknown .
In this scenario , the NLSs would be masked by the surrounding acidic motifs , e.g. , SP boxes .
Deletion of the YR ( E , D ) and SSXSSXSXXS ( D , E ) motifs , preceding the SP boxes , in XAGT would cause some unmasking of the NLSs , leading to its translocation to the nucleus ( Fig .
7 ) .
In the cases where the basic motifs in the N-terminal domain have been deleted ( e.g. , XAN , XAXM , and XAXB ) , yet another putative NLS in the RSD ( 3 , 10 , 21 ) might be responsible for their nuclear translocation .
It should be noted however , that the nuclear localization function of this alternative NLS appears to be weak .
Immunostaining experiments showed that although XAXB could be found in the nucleus without calcium signaling , this occurred in only about 10 % of the transfected COS cells ( as opposed to 70 to 80 % of cells that were transfected with XAGT ) ( 19 ) .
Unexpectedly , deletion of the SP boxes in XABB ( Fig .
5 ) , which also deleted a putative NLS , did not result in transactivation stimulated by PMA alone .
Conceivably , this deletion should disrupt the module responsible for CRI function .
Thus , this appears to indicate that the YR ( E , D ) and SSXSSX SXXS ( D , E ) motifs in the 60 residues preceding the SP boxes have a potent intrinsic inhibitory activity as proposed in the 2074 MASUDA ET AL .
first model .
It is then possible that the models mentioned above are both operating .
That is , the CRI activity could be composed of sequences that retain NFAT'x1 in the cytoplasm and sequences that mask intrinsic NLSs .
Future experiments should help us understand the details of this apparently complex regulation of NFATx1 activity .
In addition to nuclear translocation , it has been reported that calcineurin also regulates DNA binding of NFAT1 ( 26 ) .
At present , we do not know whether the CRI sequence affects NFATxl DNA binding .
We also do not know whether the mapped 60 residues can mask transactivation domains in a manner that would be calcium-calcineurin regulated , as suggested in NFAT1 regulation ( 17 ) .
An interesting observation regarding XAGT is that the PMA-A23187 transactivation activity was separable from CRI function ( Fig .
5 ) .
This finding suggested that transactivation and CRI regulation may work independently .
However , it was also observed that PMA-alone induction of XAGT did not recover all activity ( Fig .
5 ) .
One reason for the incomplete recovery could be that calcium signaling is needed for additional pathways required for NFAT-dependent transcription .
This could be within NFATx1 .
That is , deletion in XAGT allowed only partial unmasking of putative NLSs , and further calcineurin action on the remaining residues was needed to allow complete NLS unmasking .
Another possibility is that calcium signaling could be required independently of NFAT'x1 .
For example , calcineurin has been shown to affect Jun kinase activity ( 34 ) and AP-1 activity ( 29 ) .
Fully activated AP-1 would then join XAGT , resulting in maximal transactivation .
Again , from comparison of XAGT with XAXB , it is apparent that the SP boxes affect PMA-A23187-induced transactivation ( Fig .
5 ) .
Likewise , deletions other than XAGT affect PMA-A23187 transactivation .
It is possible that the deletions caused structural defects that would affect nuclear translocation and/or DNA binding .
Alternatively , bona fide transactivation domains are present in the amino terminus of NFATx1 , and their deletion would affect transactivation .
Future experiments will tell us whether the downregulation was due to direct effects on transactivation .
The discrepancy between the deduced and apparent sizes of NFAT'x1 in SDS-polyacrylamide gels indicated that its amino terminus was modified .
The activities causing these modifications were present and constitutively activated in Jurkat , COS-7 , and 293T cells ( 19 ) .
Further deletions within the amino terminus indicated that in fact there were multiple modifications , since no particular deletion could account for all the mobility shift .
That is , a gradual reduction of molecular size discrepancy was observed as different regions were deleted ( Fig .
6 ) ( 19 ) .
The shift-down caused by calcineurin accounted for three-fourths of the molecular size discrepancy .
Thus , it appears that other modifications , not regulated by calcineurin , exist to account for the other fourth of the discrepancy .
The generality of the CRI regulation in NFAT proteins is implied by the conservation of N-terminal motifs in the NFAT proteins , since they were presumably maintained through evolution for similar regulatory functions .
This might explain why most , if not all , NFAT proteins activities are regulated by calcium signaling and inhibited by CsA ( 10 , 16 ) .
Nevertheless , differences may also be expected since there are considerable dissimilarities and gaps within motifs in the different NFAT proteins ( Fig .
1B ) ( 16 ) .
Similar deletions in other NFAT proteins , coupled to chimera constructions , should shed some light on their similarities and differences .
Finally , our coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that calcineurin physically associated with its substrate NFATx1 even after it had been already dephosphorylated .

This finding appears counterintuitive , but we believe that it is a necessary step to offset the activity of a potent constitutive NFAT kinase ( 33 ) .
Negative regulation by a constitutive kinase may be used to provide a rapid repression of NFAT action once the inducer is removed .
Consistent with this idea is the fact that the association is also seen in the nucleus .
We found that when calcineurin was cotransfected into COS cells with NFATx1 , both proteins colocalized in the nucleus after stimulation of the calcium signaling pathway .
In the absence of NFATx1 , on the other hand , calcineurin localized throughout the whole cell regardless of the stimulation status of the cells ( 19 ) .
Another significant outcome for the interplay of a kinase and a phosphatase on multiple residues in NFAT is that it could be used as a mechanism to ensure that NFAT responds only upon sustained calcium mobilization .
Recently , T-cell responses were shown to depend on the activation of a threshold number of T-cell receptors ( 35 ) .
This threshold was correlated with the duration of calcium mobilization .
It is possible that NFAT proteins uphold this type of regulation by responding only when a certain threshold level of mobilized calcium is sustained to allow activated calcineurin to bind and inactivate CRI function .
In this case , controlling the amount and duration of the calcium that is mobilized would determine whether NFAT proteins carry on with their transactivation activities .
