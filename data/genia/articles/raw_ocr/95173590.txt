Brief Definitive Report Calcium /Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase II Downregulates Both Calcineurin and Protein Kinase C-mediated Pathways for Cytokine Gene Transcription in Human T Cells By Nobuaki Hama , Fotini Paliogianni , Barri J. Fessler , and Dimitrios T. Boumpas From the Kidney Disease Section , Metabolic Diseases Branch , National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 Summary Engagement of the T cell receptor for antigen activates phospholipase C resulting in an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ( [ Ca # + ] ; ) and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) .
Increased [ Ca # * ] ; activates Ca**/calmodulin-dependent kinases including the multifunctional Ca**/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaM-K II ) , as well as calcineurin , a type 2B protein phosphatase .
Recent studies have identified calcineurin as a key enzyme for interleukin ( IL ) -2 and IL-4 promoter activation .
However , the role of CaM-K II remains unknown .
We have used mutants of these kinases and phosphatases ( ys3 '' *CaM-K and ACaM-Al , respectively ) to explore their relative role in cytokine gene transcription and their interactions with PKC-dependent signaling systems .
ys `` CaM-K and ACaM-AI , known to exhibit constitutive Ca**-independent activity , were cotransfected ( alone or in combination ) in Jurkat T cells with a plasmid containing the intact IL-2 promoter driving the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene .
Cotransfection of ys*CaM-K with the IL-2 promoter construct downregulated its transcription in response to stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) .
The inhibitory effect of CaM-K II on IL-2 promoter was associated with decreased transcription of its AP-1 and NF-AT transactivating pathways .
Under the same conditions , ACaM-AI superin-duced IL-2 promoter activity ( approximately twofold increase ) .
When both mutants were used in combination , y3*CaM-K inhibited the induction of the IL-2 promoter by ACaM-AI .
Similar results were obtained when a construct containing the IL-4 promoter also was used .
y3 '' CaM-K. also downregulated the activation of AP-1 in response to transfection with a constitutively active mutant of PKC or stimulation with PMA .
These results suggest that CaM-K II may exert negative influences on cytokine gene transcription in human T cells , and provide preliminary evidence for negative cross-talk with the calcineurin- and PKC-dependent signaling systems .
L2 gene transcription is controlled by a promoter re gion extending ~326 bp upstream of the transcription start site .
This promoter region contains binding sites for at least five nuclear proteins including nuclear factors NF-AT , Oct-1 , NF- « B , AP-1 , and CD28RC ( 1 , 2 ) .
Both an increase of cytoplasmic calcium ( Ca** ) and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) are required for its activation in resting T cells .
Recent studies have established that the Ca # +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaM kinase II ) is the general or multifunctional kinase of Ca*+-signaling systems ( reviewed in 3 ) .
CaM kinase II is present in most tissues as an oligomer composed of 6-12 subunits , depending on the isoform and tissue .
All 11 isoforms described to date ( ax , ss , B , B ' , ya .
ys , Yo , da , ds or 53 , dc or 82 , 5p or 84 ) share a highly conserved catalytic domain at the NH > -terminal portion of the molecule , an autoinhibitory sequence overlapping with a calmodulin binding region and an association domain which 1217 is important for the formation of the holoenzyme ( 3-5 ) .
After an increase in intracellular free Ca*+* concentration ( [ Ca®* ) ; ) , Ca % + /calmodulin activates CaM kinase II causing the kinase to phosphorylate itself on the Thr® '' ( a isoform ) or Thr '' ( B and y isoforms ) site of the autoinhibitory domain .
This phosphorylation event results in disruption of the autoinhibitory domain and Ca # *-independent activity ( ~20-80 % of maximal Ca # *-stimulated activity ) ( 3 ) .
Mutations at Thr®® ( e.g. , change to Asp ) result in mutants with 20-40 % activity in the absence of Ca # +* /calmodulin stimulation ( 3 ) .
Constitutively active mutants of CaM kinase II can be used to investigate its role in the transcriptional regulation and to isolate the potential effects of this enzyme from other Ca*-dependent events ( 6 ) .
Increase in [ Ca # + ] ; and activation of calmodulin may also activate Ca**/calmodulin-dependent phosphatases such as calcineurin , a type 2B serine/threonine protein phosphatase .
The Journal of Experimental Medicine « Volume 181 March 1995 1217-1222 Work from several laboratories has identified calcineurin as a key enzyme needed for IL-2 and I4 promoter activity ( 7-9 ) .
In addition to its effects on the intact IL-2 promoter , calcineurin can separately lead to the transactivation of nuclear factors NF-AT and Oct-1 ( NF-IL2A , OAP/Oct-1 ) .
More recent data have also suggested that calcineurin may act in synergy with PMA to inactivate IxB/MAD3 , an inhibitor of NF-KB , thereby resulting in net activation of the NF-KB ( 10 ) .
Whereas the role of CaM kinase II has been well defined in neuronal tissues , its role in T cell activation remains largely unknown .
In human lymphocytes , stimulation via the TCR or with calcium ionophores increases CaM kinase II activity ( 5 , 11 ) .
Using constitutively active mutants of CaM kinase II , calcineurin , and PKC , we asked whether CaM kinase II is involved in the regulation of IL-2 and IL-4 promoter transcription and its influence on the effects of calcineurin- and PKC -dependent signaling systems .
Our data indicate that CaM kinase downregulates the transcription of these cytokines and provides preliminary evidence for cross-talk among these pathways .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture - Human Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated PCS , 25 ug/ml gentamicin , and 5 x 10-5 M 2-ME ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) .
Plasmid Constructs .
- The reporter plasmid IL-2 CAT contains the human IL-2 promoter ( base pairs -448 to +43 ) directing the transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .
This plasmid also includes an SV 40 polyadenylation site between vector sequences and -448 of the IL-2 promoter to prevent vector-depen-dent transcription from contributing to the observed CAT activity ( 7 ) .
Plasmid AP-1 CAT ( TRE-tk CAT ) ( a gift from Dr. M. Karin , University of California at San Diego , La Jolla , CA ) contains a synthetic oligonucleotide from -73 to -65 of the human col-lagenase gene cloned into the HindIII/BamHI cut of pBLCAT 2 , which contains the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter from position -109 to +51 in front of the CAT structural gene ( 12 ) .
Plasmid NF-AT CAT ( a gift from Dr. G. R. Crabtree , Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) has three copies of NF-AT-binding site containing 5 ' IL-2 sequences -255 to ~285 linked to the IL-2 promoter sequences from -72 to +47 linked to the CAT gene ( 8 ) .
Plasmid IL-4 CAT ( a gift from Dr. G. Thyphronitis , Institute Pasteur , Lille , France ) contains the human IL-4 promoter ( base pairs -418 to +50 ) cloned into the Not I site of pUMSP ; , , which is on a pSVOCAT-based vector that contains the upstream sequences of the c-mos gene to stop read-through transcription , and the polylinker of the pBluescript .
Plasmid ys '' CaM-K ( a gift from Dr. H. Schulman , Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) is a constitutive mutant of the human T lymphocyte y3CaM kinase ( 5 ) .
EcoRI linkers were added to the Clal-NotI fragment containing the full-length ysCaM kinase .
This fragment was then inserted into pSR & BKS , forming a complete ysCaM kinase-SRe « x expression construct .
Subsequently , Thr®* '' was replaced with Asp using site-directed mutagenesis to make mutant ys '' CaM-K .
This mutation mimics the effect of autophosphorylation on disrupting the autoinhibitory domain and generates a CaM kinase which is substantially Ca** -independent .
ys `` *CaM-K was nearly 40 % active in the absence of Ca**/calmodulin ( 5 ) .
In cells stimulated with ionomycin and PMA , and transfected with 10 ug of ys*CaM-K , the activity ( determined in cytoplasmic extracts using the synthetic 1218 peptide substrate syntide that is recognized by this kinase ) was two-to threefold higher than in cells transfected with its vector ( data not shown ) .
Plasmid double mutant ( inactive/constitutive ) yeCaM-K ( also a gift from Dr. H. Schulman ) is the catalytically inactive mutant of Double mutant ys '' *CaM-K was constructed by replacing Lys*® ( which is a conserved residue essential for catalytic activity ) with Met in the ATP binding ( catalytic ) domain .
Plasmid ACaM-Al ( a gift from Dr. R. L. Kincaid , Human Genome Sciences , Inc. , Rockville , MD ) is a deletion mutant of the catalytic subunit of the wild-type murine calcineurin , the sequence of which has 99 % homology to the corresponding human subunit .
ACaM-Al lacks functional CaM-binding and autoinhibitory domains .
This truncation was designed to mimic proteolyzed forms of the phosphatase known to have -independent , constitutive phosphatase activity in vitro ( 7 ) .
Plasmid ( a gift from Dr. M.-A .
Muramatsu , University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan ) is the constitutively active mutant of PKCB which lacks the regulatory domain ( phorbol ester binding domain ) .
APKCB lacks the coding region for amino acids at positions 6-159 of PKC ( 13 ) .
In control experiments , the expression vector alone was used .
DNA Transfections .
- Transfections of Jurkat T cells were carried out by the DEAE-dextran method as previously described ( 14 ) .
To monitor and control for transfection efficiency , cells were cotransfected with pCMV.Gal which contains the CMV-IE promoter directing transcription of the bacterial B-galactosidase ( 3-gal ) gene ( 7 ) .
CAT Assay .
- The CAT assay was carried out as described previously ( 14 ) .
The CAT activity was then normalized to the B-gal activity .
Results ys*CaM-K Does Not Substitute for The Ca**-dependent Signaling Pathway for IL-2 Promoter Transactivation .
- In the Jurkat model system , ACaM-AI can substitute for the Ca®* signal required for IL-2 gene transcription ( 7 , 8 , 14 ) .
To investigate the role of CaM kinase II in the activation of the IL-2 promoter , we cotransfected a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter linked to the CAT gene along with plasmids ACaM-Al or y3*CaM-K into these cells .
Cells were stimulated with ionomycin and/or PMA .
As shown in Fig .
1 , both ionomycin and PMA were required for IL-2 promoter activation .
ACaM-AI was able to partially substitute for the Ca # * ionophore ( ~50 % activity as compared to stimulation with ionomycin and PMA ) .
Furthermore , addition of ionomycin further induced IL-2 promoter activity by approximately twofold ( range 1.8-2.4 ) suggesting that in addition to calcineurin other Ca**-dependent pathways are also involved in IL-2 promoter activity .
The effect of calcineurin was specific since it did not affect the activity of the unrelated promoter pCMV.Gal ( 98.9 + 15.3 % of activity of cells treated with the vector alone ) .
As shown in the same figure , these pathways most likely do not involve CaM kinase , since in similar experiments ys '' CaM-K not only could not substitute for ionomycin but , to the contrary , exerted a negative effect on the transactivation of IL-2 promoter in response to stimulation with ionomycin and PMA ( Fig .
1 ) ( see below ) .

ys*CaM-K Downregulates the Transcription of Other Ca®*-dependent Promoters .
- In addition to 11-2 promoter the Ca ?
* pathway is also involved in the regulation of other cytokine promoters such as IL-4 , a Th2 promoter .
Even though the signal transduction pathway may be different in IL-2~ and IL-4-producing Th1 and Th2 clones , both pathways share the [ Ca @ * ] ; elevation ( 15 ) .
Recent data have suggested that calcineurin alone may upregulate the transcriptional activity of II4 ( reference 9 and Paliogianni , F. , N. Hama , G. J. Mavro-thalassitis , G. Thyphronitis , and D. T. Boumpas , manuscript in preparation ) .
To determine the effects of ys3*CaM-K on this promoter , Jurkat cells were transfected with a construct of IL-4 promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene .
Similar to IL-2 , transfection with ys*CaM-K resulted in a small ( ~40 % ) but reproducible inhibition of the transcriptional activity of the IL-4 promoter in response to ionomycin or ACaM-AlI ( Fig .

These data suggest that ys '' CaM-K may counteract the effects of calcineurin ( and probably other Ca*+-pathways ) .
ys*CaM-K Counteracts the Effects of ACaM-A1I on IL-2 Promoter .

Ss Sas S S m o so RELATIVE CAT ACTIVITY , % 3 ] s S5 a Bos Z Discussion In this study we have presented evidence that CaM kinase II may downregulate Ca*+- and PKC-dependent transactivating pathways for cytokine gene transcription in human T cells .
The effect of CaM kinase II seems to be specific since CaM kinase II does not affect the activity of the unrelated promoter pCMV.Gal .
Furthermore , the double mutant ( inactive/constitutive ) ysCaM-K does not affect the IL-2 promoter activity , suggesting that inhibition of gene transcription requires the presence of a catalytically active domain of CaM kinase II and it is not due to the competing effects of the vectors used in these experiments .
These results provide a molecular basis for the previously reported negative effects of the Ca**-pathway on T cells , such as negative selection and anergy ( 18-20 ) .
IL-2 is one of the major growth factors for the cells of the immune system .
Inadequate production of IL-2 has significant consequences for the T cells and may result in anergy and tolerance .
Exogenous II-2 or costimulation via the CD28 pathway may reverse these states suggesting that the total amount of IL-2 produced in an immune response plays a critical role in determining the extent of the anergy ( 20 , 21 ) .
In addition to playing a major role in the physiological immune responses against foreign antigens IL-2 may also be involved in autoimmune phenomena .
A stringent control of the production of IL-2 is therefore required to avoid excess production which may lead to breaking of tolerance and autoimmune phenomena .
Work from several laboratories has associated the lack of IL-2 production in anergic states to defects in the transactivation of nuclear factors , AP-1 ( 22 ) , NF-AT , and NF-KB ( 23 ) .
These results suggest that activation of CaM kinase II may provide an additional regulatory mechanism for the fine tuning of IL-2 production during T cell activation .
It is possible that the downregulation of these transactivating pathways may be due , at least in part , to activation of CaM kinase II .
Although in these experiments CaM kinase II only partially inhibited IL-2 transcription , this may be sufficient to result in autocrine rather than paracrine levels of IL-2 production ( 20 ) .
Furthermore , the degree of inhibition may differ among different types or clones of T cells .
CaM Kinase II and Cytokine Gene Transcription In the murine system of T cell anergy , costimulation of T cells through the CD28 pathway augments IL-2 production from autocrine to paracrine levels and prevents induction of anergy ( 21 ) .
Although increases in [ Ca # + ] ; during activation through TCR will activate both calcineurin ( which augments IL-2 production ) and CaM kinase II ( which decreases it ) , it is conceivable that additional accessory stimuli ( e.g. , stimulation via CD2 , CD5 , or CD28 ) may shift the balance towards one or the other of these enzymes .
Downregulation of IL-4 production of CaM kinase II is also of interest .
IL-4 is the other major T cell growth factor and is essential for the regulation of humoral immune re-sponses .
Anergic T cells lose their responsiveness to IL-4 ( 20 ) .
Decreased production of IL-4 by CaM kinase II may be an additional proximal mechanism to prevent proliferative response by these cells .
This study has presented preliminary data on cross-talk between the CaM kinase II and calcineurin signaling systems .
During T cell activation the partial inhibition of IL-2 or IL-4 promoter activity by CaM kinase II suggests that their effects may be exerted at more distal sites in the calcineurin regulated pathways .
Calcineurin is known to activate several dis crete transactivating pathways including NF-AT , Oct-1/OAP , and NF-KB and to downregulate the activity of AP-1 ( 7-10 ) .
Hashimoto et al .
( 24 ) have shown that calcineurin is phos-phorylated by the autophosphorylated form of CaM kinase II .
Whether these in vitro data have any relevance to explaining the attenuating effects of CaM kinase II on calcineurin in vivo can not be addressed by these studies .
Whereas it is well established that PKC may exhibit both negative and positive cross-talk with CaM kinase II ( 25 ) , the effects of CaM kinase on PKC are less well characterized .
Our data provide for the first time evidence that CaM kinase II may downregulate PKC-dependent pathways for T cell activation .
Once more the partial inactivation of the PKC mediated AP-1 induction suggests that CaM kinase II more likely affects distal sites in the PKC mediated pathway .
In summary , our data have identified CaM kinase II as a potential candidate for some of the negative effects of the Ca**-pathway on T cell activation .
Furthermore , these data provide indirect evidence for cross-talk between the calcium and the PKC pathways during T cell activation .
Additional studies should further delineate this interaction and determine its importance for the activation of T cells .
