Welgus Division of Dermatology , Department of Internal Medicine , Washington University School of Medicine at Jewish Hospital , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 Abstract Interstitial collagenase ( MMP-1 ) , a metalloproteinase produced by resident and inflammatory cells during connective tissue turnover , cleaves type I collagen fibrils .
This catalytic event is rate limiting in remodeling of tissues rich in fibrillar collagen such as the skin and lungs .
The regulation of collagenase expression is cell-type specific ; bacterial LPS and zymosan , a yeast cell wall derivative , are potent inducers of collagenase expression in macrophages , but do not alter fibroblast collagenase expression .
Since promoter elements controlling collagenase transcription in monocytic cells have not been previously defined , we sought to delineate responsive cis-acting elements of the collagenase promoter in transiently transfected human ( U937 ) and murine ( J774 ) monocytic cell lines .
Deletion constructs containing as little as 72 bp of 5 ' -flanking sequence of the collagenase promoter were sufficient for LPS- or zymosan-mediated transcriptional induction , whereas phorbol inducibility exhibited an absolute requirement for upstream elements including the polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 site ( -83 to -91 ) and TTCA sequence ( -102 to -105 ) in both monocytic cells and fibroblasts .
Mutagenesis of the activator protein-1 [ AP-1 ] site at -72 abolished basal promoter activity and LPS/zymosan inducibility , while mutagenesis of an NF-kB-like site at -20 to -10 had no effect .
Nuclear extracts from LPS- and zymosan-treated cells showed strong AP-1 activity by gel-shift analysis , and supershift analysis showed the AP-1 complexes contained specific members of both the jun and fos gene families .
These data indicate that , in contrast to most LPS effects , AP-1 , but not nuclear factor-k B , mediates LPS induction of collagenase transcription in macrophagelike cells .
Furthermore , as compared to regulation by phorbol ester , collagenase induction in monocytic cells by cell wall derivatives of bacteria or yeast is largely independent of upstream promoter sequences .

Welgus Introduction In vertebrate tissues , abundant fibrillar collagens , which are resistant to most proteinases , provide a durable architecture .
Only three vertebrate proteinases efficiently degrade fibrillar collagens ; thus , this step is often rate limiting in tissue remod-eling .
These collagenases , which are interstitial collagenase ( MMP-1 ) ( 1 , 2 ) , neutrophil collagenase ( MMP-8 ) ( 3 ) , and col-lagenase-3 ( MMP-13 ) ( 4 , 5 ) , are members of the matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) family of enzymes .
Collectively , MMPs can degrade virtually all components of the extracellular matrix ( 6 ) .
In humans , MMP-1 is the predominant collagenase of resident cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes , and also of tissue macrophages .
MMP-13 expression in humans is apparently much more restricted , being observed in breast carcinomas ( 5 ) and articular cartilage ( Welgus , H. , unpublished observa-tions ) , but not in tissue macrophages .
However , in rodents MMP-13 is the only collagenase thus far identified ; MMP-1 apparently does not exist as a functional gene in rodents .
In humans , neutrophil collagenase is largely restricted to PMNs and is the sole collagenolytic enzyme of those cells .
Interestingly , the regulation of interstitial collagenase ( MMP-1 ) is cell-type specific .
Resident cells ( e.g. , fibroblasts , keratinocytes , endothelial cells ) can produce interstitial collagenase and other metalloproteinases in response to growth factors such as EGF ( 7 ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( 8 ) , and in response to inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- ( 9 ) and IL-1 ( 10 ) , but macrophages are not responsive to these factors .
In contrast , mediators such as LPS ( 11 ) and zymosan ( 12 ) induce collagenase production in cells of the monocytic lineage , but have no effect on production of collagenase or other metalloproteinases by resident cells of epithelial or mesenchymal origin .
The induction of collagenase expression in monocytic cells is likely transcriptionally mediated , as the monocytic cell line U937 , when differentiated with phorbol ester , increases collagenase transcription when exposed to LPS ( 13 ) .
The molecular mechanisms controlling metalloproteinase expression in resident cells such as fibroblasts and kerati-nocytes have been exclusively studied .
The promoters of the interstitial collagenase and stromelysin-1 genes are similar in overall structure ( 14 ) , and these genes are often coordinately regulated .
Transcriptional induction of the collagenase and stromelysin promoters in fibroblasts is dependent not only on the prototypical activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) ' sites found near the transcription start sites of these promoters , but also upon upstream sequences including a polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 ( PEA-3 ) site and TTCA element ( 10 , 14 , 15 ) .
Thus , in resident cells of mesenchymal or epithelial origin , upstream sequences are critical for inducibility of collagenase expression .

In contrast to such resident cells , the gene regulation of metalloproteinase expression in mononuclear phagocytes has not been studied , at least in part because of the difficulty in transfecting these populations .
Yet collagenase expression by macrophages is prominent in inflammatory and matrix-destructive diseases including rheumatoid arthritis ( 16,17 ) , atherosclerosis ( 18 , 19 ) , and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome ( Welgus , H. G. , unpublished observations ) .
Bacterial LPS activation of macrophages causes a marked induction of interstitial collagenase expression ( 11 ) , as well as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 ( 20 ) , TNF- ( 21 ) , and IL-6 ( 22 ) .
Similarly , phagocytosis of zymosan , a yeast cell wall derivative , results in activation of diverse macrophage func-tions , including the production of interstitial collagenase ( 12 ) .
Induction of many inflammatory genes in macrophages such as TNF-a ( 23-25 ) , IL-1 ( 26 ) , and tissue factor ( 27 ) by LPS is mediated , in large part , by nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B , a pleiotropic transcriptional transactivator ( 28 ) .
Interestingly , the collagenase promoter contains a sequence at -20 to -10 which is similar to consensus NF-xB-binding sequences .
In this manuscript , we have delineated promoter sequences necessary for monocytic transcriptional induction of collagenase in response to the cell type-specific stimulating agents LPS and zymosan by employing a transient transfection strategy with promoter chloramphenicol transferase ( CAT ) constructs derived from the collagenase gene .
Interestingly , we found that maximal fold induction of collagenase promoter activity by LPS or zymosan was conferred by constructs containing as little as 72 bp of 5'-flanking sequence .
Mutation of the AP-1 site abolished both basal activity and induction of promoter activity .
In contrast , mutation of the NF- « B-like site did not affect either basal activity or induction of transcription .
Binding of specific members of the jun and fos gene family to the collagenase AP-1 site was strongly induced by LPS treatment , implicating AP-1 in transactivation .
Thus , in cells of monocytic origin , in contrast to resident cells such as fibroblasts , induction of collagenase transcription is mediated almost entirely through proximal promoter elements involving mainly the AP-1 site .
Methods U937 Cell culture , transfections , and CAT assay .
Human U937 cells ( CLR 1593 ; American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) were cultured in serum-containing RPMI 1640 medium as described previously ( 13 ) .
Cells were cultured at 5 X 10° cells/ml for all treatments and at 1.8 x 10 % /cm on tissue culture plastic ( Costar Corp. , Cam-bridge , MA ) .
To differentiate U937 cells for adherence and to prime for LPS stimulations , PMA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) in DMSO was added at 50 ng/m !
to the medium alone or simultaneously with LPS ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) .
Control cultures received vehicle alone .
For each promoter-CAT construct , 1 X 10 '' U937 cells in 1.5 ml of medium were transiently transfected in suspension by exposure to 75 g DEAE-Dextran ( Profection kit ; Promega Corp. , Madison , WI ) and 10 pg of supercoiled column-purified DNA ( QIAGEN , Inc. , Chatsworth , CA ) at room temperature for 20 min .
After pelleting by gentle centrifugation , cells were resuspended in 60 ml of medium and divided into three 100-cm > dishes to recover overnight .
Next , the cultures were washed and treated with control medium , medium containing PMA at 50 ng/ml , or medium containing PMA at 50 ng/ml plus LPS at 10 pg/ml .
U937 cells were harvested after 24 h with a cell scraper .
Equivalent amounts of lysates , normalized for total protein ( Bradford protein assay ; Bio-Rad Laboratories , Palo Alto , CA ) , were assayed for CAT activity as described above .
J774 Cell culture , transfections , and CAT assay .
Murine J774 cells ( TIB 67 ; American Type Culture Collection ) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % heat-denatured FBS , nonessential amino acids , L-glutamine , and penicillin-streptomycin .
These spontaneously adherent , macrophagelike cells were cultured in 6-well cluster dishes containing 5 X 10° cells/well .
Liposome-mediated cotransfection of these cells used LipofectAMINE ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) at 10 mg/ml and 2 ug of supercoiled promoter-CAT construct with 1 g of plasmid cytomegalovirus ( pCMV ) -B-ga-lactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency .
After transfection , cells were treated with control medium or medium containing LPS at 10 pg/ml or zymosan at 1 mg/ml .
After 24 h , cells were harvested for preparation of lysates as described previously ( 29 ) .
Lysates were assayed for B-galactosidase activity as described ( 30 ) and subsequently for CAT activity using acetyl CoA ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) and [ !
*CJchloramphenicol ( DuPont-NEN , Boston , MA ) , followed by TLC and autoradiography .
Human skin fibroblast culture .
Primary cultures of human skin fibroblasts were obtained by explanting from newborn foreskins .
Cultures were maintained in supplemented DMEM identical to the culture medium used for J774 cells .
Passage 3-8 cells were plated in P-100 dishes at 1.5 % 10° cells per dish and cotransfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described ( 31 ) with 20 g of each collagenase-CAT construct and 5 g of pCMV-B-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency .
After 6 h , cells were shocked with 15 % glycerol for 2 min , then treated with either control medium , medium containing PMA at 50 ng/ml , or medium containing LPS at 10 ug/ml for 24 h before harvest by scraping .
Lysates were prepared , assayed for B-galactosidase activity , and subsequently for CAT activity as described above .
RNA isolation and hybridization .
Northern analyses were done to determine the degree of induction of collagenase gene expression with various treatments .
Total RNA was isolated from 10 '' treated or control cells as described ( 32 ) .
Northern hybridizations were done as described previously ( 29 ) .
DNA probes were radiolabeled by random priming with [ « -P ] dCTP .
Human procollagenase mRNA from U937 cells was hybridized with a full-length human procollagenase cDNA ; mouse collagenase mRNA from J774 cells was detected with pUMR Case , a 2.2-kb rat collagenase cDNA clone ( 4 ) .
For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) mRNA , pRGAPDH13 , a 1.3-kb rat cDNA , was used as described ( 33 ) .
After stringent washing , membranes were exposed to AR x-ray film ( Eastman Kodak Co. , Rochester , NY ) at -70°C for 4 to 24 h with an intensifying screen .
Construction of reporter constructs .
The construct pCLCAT , containing sequences from -2278 to +36 of the human collagenase promoter , was a generous gift from Dr. Stephen Frisch ( La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation , La Jolla , CA ) .
The PstI site was mutated to an Xhol site , then the HindIII/Xhol fragment containing the human collagenase promoter sequences of pCLCAT was subcloned into HindIII/Xhol digested pBLCAT2 ( 34 ) , giving rise to pCL-2278CAT .
A series of deletion constructs were synthesized by PCR amplification of linearized pCL-2278CAT , in each case using a unique 5 ' primer with an engineered HindIII site and a common 3 ' primer within the CAT gene .
The resultant PCR products were digested with HindIII and Xhol and subcloned into the HindIII/Xhol digested pBLCAT2 backbone .
The 5 ' primers used in the PCR amplification , named for the most 5 ' nucleotide with identity to collagenase promoter sequences , were as follows : -511 : 5CAGGAAGCTTAACAAAGGCAGAAAGG3 ' , -179 ; 5'TTTGAAGCTTATCATGACATTGCAAF ' , -95 : STTCAAAGCTTATCAAGAGGATGTTA3 ' , -72 : STATAAAGCTTGAGTCAGACACCTCT3 ' , -55 : 5 '' CCTCAAGCTTTCTGGAAGGGCAAGGA3 ' , -34 : 5°GGGCAAGCTTTCTATATATACAGAG3 ' .
The sequence of the 3 ' primer , complementary to sequences within the bacterial chloramphenicol ( CAT ) gene contained in pCL- Cell Type-specific Collagenase Transcription 1891 2278CAT , was 5 '' TTCATTGCATACGGAATTCCGGATG3 ' .
A mutant construct , pCL-2278CATmAP-1 , with the AP-1 site replaced by an Smal restriction site , was constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis as described ( 35 ) .
The sequences of the overlapping primers were as follows : ( forward primer ) : SGCACCCGGGAGACACCT CTGGCTTTCT3 ' , ( reverse primer ) : S'TCTCCCGGGTGCTTITTAT AAC ATATCCTCT3 ' .
The external primers were : ( forward primer ) : S'AAGCCATGGTCGTATCGC3 ' , ( reverse primer ) 5°CCAATTCC CTCGAGCCCGTAAGTGATG3 ' .
The resultant mutated PCR product was digested with KpnI and Xhol .
The digested fragment was then ligated with the HindIII/KpnI fragment of the pCL-2278CAT vector and HindIII/Xhol digested pBLCAT2 .
Constructs =-511mAP-1 , -179mAP-1 , and -95mAP-1 were synthesized by PCR amplification of pCL-2278CATmAP-1 using the specific forward primers described above and the common reverse primer complementary to sequences within the CAT gene , followed by restriction digestion with HindIII and Xhol and subcloning into HindIII/Xhol digested pBLCAT2 .
Constructs -179mNFkB and -95mNFkB were constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis using pCL-2278CAT as a template .
The sequences of the overlapping PCR primers were as follows : ( forward primer ) : SGAGAACTACCA AGCTGGGATATTGGAGC3 ' , ( reverse primer ) : S'TTGGTA-GTTCACTCTGTATATATAGAGT3 ' .
The sequences of all constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing of plasmid DNA ( Seque-nase ; Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from U937 cells treated with control medium containing PMA ( 50 ng/ ml ) or PMA + LPS ( 10 pg/ml ) as described ( 36 ) .
Nuclear extracts were also isolated from 2 x 10° J774 cells treated with control medium or medium containing LPS at 10 pg/ml or zymosan at 1 mg/ml for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were aliquoted and frozen over liquid N , until use .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
To determine the binding of nuclear factors to regions of the collagenase promoter , double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized , end labeled with [ P ] -y-ATP ( ICN , Biomedicals , Inc. , Irvine , CA ) and polynucleotide kinase ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals , Indianapolis , IN ) , incubated with 5 mg of nuclear extract protein , and electrophoresed through 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels essentially as described ( 37 ) .
Extracts were incubated with 1 g poly ( dL : dC/dI : dC ) and 5- to 50-fold excess of specific or mutant unlabeled competitors for 15 min at 25°C , then 40,000 to 100,000 cpm of probe was added and incubated for 30 min at 25°C .
For supershift assays , the reaction mixture was chilled on ice , 1 pg of antibody was added , and the incubation was continued overnight at 4°C .
Antibodies were rabbit polyclonals ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) raised against specific fos or jun peptide sequences as follows : the pan-jun-specific antibody ( c-jun/AP-1 [ D ] ) recognizes the COOH terminus of mouse c-Jun p39 ; the c-Jun antibody ( c-jun/AP-1 [ N ] ) recognizes amino acids 95-105 of mouse c-Jun p39 ; the Jun B antibody ( jun B [ N-17 ] ) recognizes amino acids 45-61 of mouse Jun B p39 ; the pan-Fos-specific antibody ( c-fos- [ K-25 ] ) was raised against amino acids 128-152 of human c-fos p62 ; the c-fos-specific antibody ( c-fos [ 4 ] ) was raised to amino acids 3-16 of human c-Fos p62 ; and the Fos B-specific antibody was raised to amino acids 102-117 of the mouse fos B gene product .
Binding reactions were centrifuged at 4,000 g for 5 min at 4°C , then electrophoresed through 5 % acrylamide gels at 250 V for 2 h at 4°C .
Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 12-30 h. Results LPS treatment upregulates collagenase mRNA expression in monocytic cell lines .
To demonstrate the induction of interstitial collagenases in monocytic cells by LPS treatment , Northern blot analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from PMA-differentiated , LPS-treated , human U937 cells .
Interstitial collagenase mRNA was undetectable in control cells , in 1892 - R.A. Pierce , S. Sandefur , G.A .

In spontaneously adherent mouse J774 cells , collagenase mRNA was undetectable in control cultures , but was markedly induced in LPS-treated cultures ( Fig .
1 B ) .
These results were uniformly seen in multiple experiments .
LPS-responsive elements of the human collagenase MMP-1 promoter differ from PMA-responsive elements and reside near the transcription start site .
Previous studies indicate that LPS stimulation of collagenase expression in monocytic cells was transcriptionally mediated ( 13 ) .
To delineate LPS-responsive elements in the collagenase ( human MMP-1 ) promoter , a series of collagenase promoter-CAT constructs ( Fig .
2 4 ) were used in transient transfections of PMA-differentiated human U937 cells .
As shown in Fig .
2 B , induction of promoter activity of LPS treatment was evident in all constructs containing the AP-1 site , including pCL-72CAT .
Furthermore , as quantified in Table I , the fold induction by LPS was very similar in pCL-72CAT to all other constructs containing additional upstream sequences .
In contrast , the fold induction of transcription with PMA treatment diminished markedly with deletion of the sequences between -179 and -95 ( lacking TTCA ) and no PMA-mediated induction was observed with pCL-72CAT ( Lacking TTCA and PEA-3 , but containing AP-1 ) .
These data indicate that in monocytes , as reported in fibroblasts ( 14 , 15 ) , PMA induction of collagenase transcription is dependent upon Table I .

However , LPS-induced collagenase transcription exhibited no such de-pendence .
Similarly , in J774 cells treated with control medium or LPS at 10 ug/ml for 24 h ( Fig .
2 C ) , LPS induction persisted in all constructs containing the AP-1 site .
In fact , fold induction of the -72 construct in response to LPS was nearly identical in magnitude to that exhibited by the -511 , -179 , and -95 constructs ( Table I ) .
Both basal promoter activity and LPS induction were absent in the -55 and -34 constructs that do not contain the AP-1 sequence .
To compare induction of collagenase transcription in monocytic cells with interstitial cells , human dermal fibroblasts were transfected with collagenase promoter deletion constructs and treated with either PMA or LPS for 24 h. In these cells , as previously reported ( 38 ) , sequences 5 ' of the AP-1 site were required for PMA responsiveness ; in fact , a -95 construct containing AP-1 and PEA-3 elements , but lacking TTCA , exhibited no phorbol induction ( Fig .

As antici-pated , human dermal fibroblasts were not competent to upregulate collagenase promoter activity in response to LPS ( Fig .

In all experiments using constructs containing from 2278 to 34 bp of 5'-flanking sequence of the collagenase promoter , LPS induction was never evident .

Induction of transcription was evident by 12 h , and continued at 24 h. ( B ) Dose response of LPS induction .
J774 cells were transiently transfected with collagenase promoter-CAT constructs or heterologous promoter-CAT constructs , treated with PMA at 50 ng/ml or LPS at 2 or 10 pg/ml for 24 h. Cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity .
PMA-mediated transcriptional induction was evident in -2278CLCAT and a heterologous construct containing three tandem repeats of the collagenase AP-1 site , but not in the minimal thymidine-kinase promoter or the native collagenase -72CLCAT construct .
In contrast , LPS-mediated transcriptional induction was complete and dose dependent in the native collagenase -72CLCAT construct .
differs from PMA induction of collagenase in requirements for sequences upstream of the AP-1 site .
Time course of LPS induction of collagenase promoter activity .
We were interested in determining the time course of induction of collagenase promoter activity by LPS treatment of monocytic cells and chose to perform these studies in the murine J774 cells , which respond directly to LPS without requiring PMA differentiation .
J774 cells were transiently transfected , then treated with LPS for 4 , 8 , 12 , or 24 h. Collagenase promoter activity was slightly induced by LPS treatment at 8 h over control levels , was fully induced by 12 h , and continued at high levels through 24 h ( Fig .

Welgus increase at 8 h was quite evident ; however , a high level of induction was always observed at 12 h. LPS induction of collagenase promoter activity is dose re-sponsive .
To determine if the LPS-mediated induction of collagenase transcription was dose dependent , transiently transfected J774 cells were treated with 2 to 10 ug/ml of LPS or with PMA at 50 ng/ml for 24 h ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Constructs containing 2278 or just 72 bp of 5 ' -flanking sequence were equally LPS responsive and a dose-dependent increase in transcriptional activity was observed .
While transcriptional activity from the -2278 construct was highly responsive to PMA , the -72 construct was completely unresponsive to PMA treatment , similar to Fig .
2 B .
A control plasmid containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter linked to the CAT gene ( 34 ) exhibited no transcriptional activity , while a derived construct that contains three tandem repeats of the Ap-1 site inserted 5 of the thymidine kinase promoter exhibited basal activity , PMA responsiveness , and dose-dependent induction with LPS treatment of J774 cells .
These data further support the hypothesis that the single collagenase AP-1 site linked to minimal downstream sequences is necessary and sufficient for LPS-mediated induction of collagenase transcription , but not for PMA-induced transcription .
The AP-1 site , but not the NF- « kB-like site , is necessary for LPS-mediated transcriptional induction .
To determine whether an intact AP-1 site was necessary for collagenase transcription in the context of larger collagenase promoter fragments , site-directed mutagenesis of the collagenase promoter AP-1 site was performed ( Fig .
4 A ) .
In U937 cells , mutation of the AP-1 site ablated transcriptional activation by LPS in the context of the -2278 , -179 , and -95 collagenase promoter-CAT constructs ( Fig .
4 B ) .
Similarly , the constructs -2278mAP-1 , -179mAP-1 , and -I95mAP-1 all lacked basal activity and LPS inducibility in transfected J774 cells ( Fig .
4 C ) .
The human collagenase promoter contains a site similar to consensus sequences for the transcription factor NFkB between the TATA box and the transcription start site ( Figs .
2 A and 4 A ) .
Because NF-KB is a common transactivator of LPS-responsive genes associated with inflammation ( 28 ) , we mutated the collagenase NF- « kB-like site to test whether this site is important in the LPS-mediated induction of collagenase transcription ( Fig .
4 C ) .

Zymosan induction of collagenase transcription .
( A ) J774 cells were treated with control medium ( C ) or zymosan ( ZYM ) at 1 mg/ml for 24 h , then harvested for RNA isolation and Northern analysis of murine collagenase mRNA .
Note that zymosan treatment induced collagenase mRNA .
( B ) J774 cells were transfected with CL-2278CAT or CL-72 CAT , treated with zymosan at 1 mg/ml for 24 h , and then cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity .
Transcriptional activity was potently induced by zymosan treatment and equivalently in the -2278 , and -72 constructs .
the -179 promoter-CAT construct in J774 cells .
In this experi-ment , which was performed separately from the experiment testing the AP-1 mutants , a lower level of CAT activity was due to a lower level of transfection efficiency .
However , LPS inducibility over the zero background was evident with or without mutation of the NF- « kB-like site .
Together , these data argue that the AP-1 site , but not the NF-kB-like site , is necessary for LPS-mediated induction of collagenase transcription in monocytic cells .
Zymosan induction of collagenase in J774 cells .
Our experiments indicated that LPS induction of collagenase transcription was mediated primarily through the AP-1 site and was much less dependent on upstream sequences than the induction of collagenase in fibroblasts or monocytic cells by PMA .
We were therefore interested in determining whether similar regulatory mechanisms would be characteristic of zymosan induction of collagenase , as this is another agent that , like LPS , activates human macrophage collagenase expression , but has no effect on collagenase expression in other cells such as fibroblasts ( 12 ) .
The spontaneously adherent J774 cells respond to zymosan by upregulation of collagenase mRNA ( Fig .
5 A ) ; however , the PMA -differentiated U937 cells did not respond to zymosan treatment ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we tested the response of the collagenase promoter to zymosan in J774 cells .
Transiently transfected , zymosan-treated J774 cells exhibited marked and near-equivalent induction of collagenase promoter activity with deletion constructs containing 2278 and 72 bp of 5'-flanking sequence of the collagenase promoter ( Fig .
5 B ) .
Similar results were obtained with deletion constructs containing from 511 to 95 bp of 5'-flanking sequence ( data not shown ) .
LPS and zymosan treatment results in induction of AP-1 and NF-kB .
Because our transient transfection analysis of the collagenase promoter implicated the AP-1 element in both LPS- and zymosan-mediated induction , we were interested in analyzing the induction of AP-1 complexes in U937 and J774 cells .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from U937 cells treated for 24 h with PMA or PMA plus LPS and from J774 cells treated for 24 h with LPS or zymosan as described above .
The quality of all extracts was assessed by mobility-shift assays using the constitutive nuclear protein Oct 1 ( data not shown ) .
Extracts were incubated with P-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the collagenase promoter wild-type AP-1 site ( Fig .
6 A ) .
Extracts from untreated U937 cells exhibited little binding to the AP-1 oligonucleotide , while extracts prepared from LPS-treated , PMA-differentiated U937 cells exhibited greater binding to the AP-1 site than extracts derived from cells treated with PMA alone ( Fig .
6 B ) .
Competition with fivefold excess unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide diminished binding and a 50-fold excess abolished bind-ing , while mutant competitor had no effect on binding activity .
Thus , specific binding to the collagenase AP-1 site is potentiated by LPS treatment of PMA-differentiated U937 cells .
Similarly , extracts from control J774 cells exhibited some binding to the AP-1 site , which was markedly increased in extracts from LPS treated cells ( Fig .
6 C ) .
This binding was competed by a fivefold molar excess of unlabeled competitor , indicating a high degree of specificity of binding .
Further increases in unlabeled competitor abolished specific binding completely , while a mutated competitor was ineffective in competing for binding even at a 50-fold excess concentration .

Welgus duction of binding activity to the collagenase AP-1 site was also evident ( Fig .
6 D ) .
To determine whether the NF- « B-like site in the collagenase promoter is functional in binding NF- « B , this sequence was used to compete binding to an NF-kB consensus sequence ( Fig .
6 E ) .
Extracts from control U937 cells exhibited some basal level of binding activity for the consensus NFkB sequence .
This was readily competed by 25-fold excess unlabeled consensus competitor , but not by a 25-fold excess of double-stranded oligonucleotide derived from the collagenase pro-moter .
Specific binding to the consensus NF-kB oligonucleotide was increased in extracts from PMA-differentiated cells and markedly induced by LPS treatment .
However , similar to the binding activity exhibited in extracts from control cells , this activity was not competed by excess oligonucleotide derived from the collagenase NF-xB-like site .
These data indicate that while NF- « B activity is induced by LPS treatment , the NF- « kB-like site identified in the collagenase promoter does not specifically bind the NF-kB complexes .
C-Jun , Jun B , Jun D , and c-Fos are present in LPS-induced AP-1 complexes .
To define the specific proteins present in the shifted complexes , antibodies to specific components of AP-1 complexes were used in supershift assays involving LPS stimulation of human U937 cells .
Supershifted bands were detected when binding reactions included antibodies to c-Jun , Jun B , and Jun D , indicating these components are present in the AP-1 complexes induced by LPS stimulation of U937 cells ( Fig .

Similarly , an anti-Fos antibody which recognizes all members of the fos gene family and a specific antibody to c-Fos were used in supershift assays , resulting in altered mobility of the DNA-protein complexes and indicating the presence of c-Fos .
In supershift assays employing this same panel of antibodies , but using nuclear extracts from LPS or zymosan-treated J774 cells , the same pattern of results was obtained ( data not shown ) .

Discussion In this manuscript , we present the novel finding that a 72-bp sequence of the interstitial collagenase promoter , from the transcription start site to the AP-1 site , is sufficient for maximal fold induction of transcription in monocytic cells .
It is widely recognized that AP-1 plays a vital role in transcriptional regulation of matrix metalloproteinases , including interstitial collagenase .
There is , however , strong evidence that sequences upstream of the AP-1 site are necessary for maximal fold induction of collagenase transcription in resident cell types .
In 1990 , Gutman and Wasylyk ( 15 ) reported that in mouse fibroblasts ( LMTK~ ) , the human collagenase promoter uses a phorbol- and oncogene-responsive unit that encompasses the PEA-3- and AP-1-binding sites .
They named this unit TORU ( TPA and oncogene-responsive unit ) .
Mutation of the PEA-3 site resulted in markedly lower fold induction of transcription upon phorbol stimulation or cotransfection with oncogene expression vectors .
In 1991 , two reports from Brinckerhoff and co-workers ( 10 , 14 ) indicated that upstream elements , cooperating with the AP-1 site , were necessary for induction of transcription in fibroblasts .
They reported that a PEA-3-like element and also a TTCA sequence were necessary for phorbol inducibility of collagenase transcription in fibroblasts .
The minimal promoter fragment which was phorbol responsive was 127 bp in length ( 14 ) .
Similarly , they found that both IL-1 and phorbol induction of the stromelysin promoter requires an upstream element that cooperates with the AP-1 site ( 10 ) .
The fold induction of transcriptional activity in the shortest AP-1-containing construct was two- to threefold with IL-1 or phorbol treatment in human skin fibroblasts , but five- to sixfold in constructs containing upstream sequences , indicating that cooperation between the AP-1 site and upstream elements is required for maximal fold induction of stromelysin in fibroblasts .
Also in 1991 , Buttice et al .
( 39 ) reported that the AP-1 site is necessary for basal and maximal activity of the stromelysin promoter , but not for phorbol induction , in human and mouse cells .
In 1993 , Buttice and Kurkinen ( 38 ) demonstrated that the PEA-3 site , 5 '' of the AP-1 site , plays a major role in phorbol induction of the stromelysin gene .
Together , these studies emphasize that in human and mouse fibroblasts , with a variety of stimuli , elements upstream to AP-1 are critical for maximal fold induction of metalloproteinase transcription .
Indeed , fold induction was increased by a factor of two to five by inclusion of upstream sequences in these studies .
The previous reports contrast strongly with our findings regarding collagenase induction in monocytic cells .
In PMA ferentiated U937 cells , the fold induction of the -72 construct on LPS treatment was similar to the fold induction observed with constructs containing additional 5 '' flanking sequences up to 2278 bp .
Similarly , in murine J774 cells , the magnitude of LPS induction of a construct containing only 72 bp of 5 flanking sequence was equal to constructs containing 179 , 511 , or 2278 bp of 5 ' flanking sequences ( Table I ) .
While absolute promoter activity is maximal with larger constructs in our studies , this finding does not indicate that upstream elements are LPS-or zymosan-responsive , but rather that upstream elements are Cell Type-specific Collagenase Transcription 1897 necessary for full basal and induced transcriptional activity .
This is fundamentally different from the previous studies in resident cells outlined above , where upstream elements were clearly responsive to either phorbol ester or IL-1 .
In those studies , additional sequences conferred greater fold induction of transcription in response to stimulation .
To our knowledge , this study is the first to delineate collagenase promoter elements responsive to macrophage-specific mediators and to suggest that elements of the collagenase promoter from -72 to the transcription start site alone can be sufficient to mediate this gene 's induction in monocytic cells .
The cell model systems we used included both PMA -differentiated U937 human monocytic cells and macrophage-like murine J774 cells .
Each of these two cell lines offered advantages for this study .
Notably , there are no spontaneously adherent human monocytic cell lines capable of responding directly to LPS .
Therefore , we used PMA-differentiated human U937 cells , which responded potently to LPS stimulation .
We also studied murine J774 cells to complement and validate our studies in the human U937 cells , because these cells are pheno-typically very similar to tissue macrophages .
They are spontaneously adherent and respond directly to LPS .
In murine cells and tissues , however , MMP-13 appears to be the only collagenase present .
Indeed , expression of MMP-13 was induced by LPS ( Fig .
1 B ) , indicating that these cells possess all the machinery necessary to upregulate metalloproteinase expression , precisely as pulmonary alveolar macrophages do .
The identity of results between the phorbol-differentiated U937 cells and J774 cells strongly suggests that the responsive elements of MMP genes and the nuclear factors conferring transactivation operate across mammalian species .
In our studies , induction of nuclear proteins capable of binding the collagenase AP-1 site was markedly upregulated by LPS treatment of PMA-differentiated U937 cells and by LPS or zymosan treatment of J774 cells .
Further analysis using antibodies specific for individual components of the AP-1 complexes identified c-Jun , Jun B , Jun D , and c-Fos in protein complexes bound to the AP-1 site .
Because the antibodies used may differ in their affinities and efficiency of binding under experimental conditions , these assays do not ascertain which of these components are predominant .
Angel and Karin ( 1992 ) showed that c-Jun is necessary for collagenase activation ( 40 ) .
If this requirement for c-Jun is operative in transactivation of monocytic cells as well , c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers may predominate in LPS- or zymosan-stimulated macrophagelike cells .
LPS binding to CD14 on the cell surface ( 41 ) starts a cascade of signal transduction which ultimately results in the activation of the AP-1 and NF-kB transcription factors , among others ( 28 ) .
We identified an NF-xB-like sequence in the collagenase promoter between the TATA box and transcription initiation site , yet mutation of this site failed to affect LPS-mediated transactivation .
The binding of nuclear proteins from LPS-stimulated cells to a consensus NF-kB site derived from the immunoglobulin kappa gene enhancer indicated that NF-kB was strongly upregulated by LPS treatment ; however , this binding activity was not efficiently competed by excess unlabeled collagenase NF-kB-like sequences .
In contrast , deletion or mutagenesis of the AP-1 site completely abrogated collagenase transactivation in response to LPS treatment .
Therefore , collagenase transactivation by LPS in dependent upon AP-1 , but exhibits no involvement of this NF- « B-like 1898 _ R.A. Pierce , S. Sandefur , G.A .

Welgus site .
While we can not rule out participation of other sequences of the collagenase gene ( in addition to -2278 to +36 ) in the LPS-mediated transcriptional induction in macrophages , it is clear that the sequences between -72 and -55 , including the AP-1 site , are critical for this response .
In this report , we have shown that upstream promoter elements such as PEA-3 and TTCA , which are required for resident cell induction of collagenase expression , contribute little or nothing to transcriptional activation of the collagenase gene in monocytic cells .
Indeed , our data suggest that elements of the collagenase promoter from -72 to the transcription start site alone can be sufficient to mediate this gene 's induction in response to macrophage-specific mediators such as LPS and zymosan .
These results emphasize the cell type-specific differences which exist in metalloproteinase expression and may have important implications for understanding pathogenetic mechanisms in diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis .
