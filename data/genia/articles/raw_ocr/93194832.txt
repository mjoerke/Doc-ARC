Transcriptional Regulation of the Pyruvate Kinase Erythroid-specific Promoter* ( Received for publication , July 17 , 1992 ) Isabelle Max-Audit , Jean-Francois Eleouet } , and Paul-Henri Roméo From Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U.91 , Hopital Henri Mondor , 94010 Créteil , France Mammal pyruvate kinases are encoded by two genes .
The L gene produces the erythroid ( R-PK ) or the hepatic ( L-PK ) isozymes by the alternative use of two promoters .
We report the characterization of the cis-and trans-acting elements involved in the tissue-specific activity of the L gene erythroid promoter .
A R-PK DNA fragment extending from -870 to +54 relative to the cap site confers erythroid specificity to a reporter gene .
Within this region , we define a minimal promoter ( -62 to +54 ) that displays erythroid-specific activity and contains two DNA binding sites .
One , located at -50 , binds members of the CCACC/Sp1 family and the other , located at -20 , binds the erythroid factor GATA-1 .
Although the -20 GATA binding site ( AGATAA ) is also a potential TFIID binding site , it does not bind TFIID .
Furthermore , the substitution of this GATA binding site by a canonical TFIID binding site suppresses the promoter activity .
Mutations and deletions of both sites indicate that only the association of CCACC/Spl and GATA binding sites can drive efficient and tissue-specific expression of this R-PK minimal promoter .
Finally , by co-transfection experi-ments , we study the elements involved in the hGATA-1 transactivation of the R-PK promoter in HeLa cells .
Pyruvate kinase ( ATP : pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase , EC 2.7.1.40 ; PK ) , a key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway ( 1 ) , is present in mammals in four different isozymic forms ( L , R , M ; , and M ; ) whose expression is tissue-specific ( 2 ) .
These isoforms are encoded by two genes .
The M gene codes for the M ; -type present in muscle and brain and for the M ; -type found in the fetus , in undifferentiated tissues , and in most adult tissues .
M ; - and M-type PK are generated by mRNAs produced after alternative splicing of the same primary transcript ( 3 ) .
L-type ( L-PK ) and R-type ( R-PK ) isoforms are also encoded by a single gene through the use of two distinct transcription units , the first exon of R-PK being situated 500 bp upstream of the first exon of L-PK ( 4 ) .
L-PK is expressed mainly in liver but also in gut and kidney , while R-PK is specific to erythroid cells ( 2 , 5 ) .
During erythroid differentiation , immature erythroblasts express R-PK and M ; , -PK , while mature erythrocytes contain only R-PK .

The abbreviations used are : PK , pyruvate kinase ; bp , base pair ( s ) ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; TPA , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ; GpB , glycophorin B. and others have previously determined the relative amount of M ; , -PK and R-PK during the maturation of erythroblasts ( 6-8 ) , and we have determined the relative contribution of synthesis and degradation of the two isoenzymes in the acquisition of the PK phenotype of mature erythrocytes ( 9 ) .
The structure of the rat L-type PK gene has been determined ( 4 , 10 ) .
This gene is composed of 12 exons and extends over 9.3 kilobases of DNA .
Transcriptional regulation of L-PK in liver by hormonal and nutritional stimuli ( 11 , 12 ) , as well as the determination of the DNA elements implicated in these effects and in liver specificity , have been the subject of numerous studies .
Four binding sites for transcription factors have been described in a proximal promoter : two of them bind liver-specific factors ( the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 and the liver factor A1 ) , and the two others bind ubiquitous factors ( the nuclear factor 1 and the major late transcription factor ) ( 13-16 ) .
The upstream part of this promoter bears a carbohydrate response element ( 17 , 18 ) .
Expression of the L-gene has also been studied with transgenic mice containing either the entire L-gene ( 19 ) or a reporter gene under the control of the L-PK promoter ( 20 ) .
Although an adequate tissue specificity of the rat L-type PK transcription unit was repetitively obtained , very low or no expression from the rat R-type PK transcription unit was found .
This indicates that the DNA fragments used do not contain all the DNA sequences necessary for erythroid-specific expression .
This result is indeed similar to the one obtained with the human -globin genes .
In transgenic mice , the expression of the B-globin genes is low unless an upstream sequence , called locus control region is present ( 21 ) .
However , B-globin promoter elements which mediate the locus control region activity have been determined by transfection in erythroid cell lines ( 22 ) .
These results prompt us to study whether the R-PK promoter could display erythroid specificity and to determine the cis- and trans-acting elements involved in the activity of this promoter .
In this study , we define by deletion experiments a core promoter sufficient to confer erythroid-specific expression to a reporter gene .
The respective involvement of the different sites present on this minimal promoter was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis .
Finally , the relative contribution of GATA-1 and TFIID in the activity of the R-PK promoter was studied .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture-Two human erythroleukemic cell lines , K562 and HEL , were used to study the erythroid-specific expression .
K-562 was established from the pleural effusion of a 53-year-old female with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis ( 23 ) , whereas HEL was derived from the peripheral blood of a 28-year-old male with Hodgkin 's disease who later developed erythroleukemia ( 24 ) .
These two cell lines express several erythroid markers including globins and R-PK ( 6 , 24 , 25 ) .
Different inducers have an effect on the level of expression of these erythroid markers leading to an 5431 5432 increased level as do hemin or to a decreased level as do TPA ( 24-27 ) .
The human epithelial cell line HeLa was used as a nonerythroid control cell line .
K562 and HEL cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium while HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium , each supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 50 units/ml penicillin , and 50 mg/ml streptomycin .
Construction of Reporter Plasmids-All the reporter plasmids were constructed by insertion ( 5 HindIII , 3 BamHI ) of the DNA fragments of interest upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) bacterial coding sequence followed by the t intron and the polyadenylation signal from simian virus 40 using pBLCAT3 vector ( 28 ) .
pR-CAT , a rat genomic clone encoding both the R- and L-type PK , has been isolated and sequenced ( 4 ) .
A DNA fragment spanning nucleotides -870 to +54 relative to R-PK cap site was amplified using the oligonucleotides -870 and +54 ( see below ) .
The amplified fragment was inserted in M13mp9 , sequenced , and subcloned in pBLCAT3 vector .
Deleted constructs were obtained either by amplification ( pA105R-CAT : oligonucleotides -105 and +54 , pAGZ2R-CAT : oligonucleotides -62 and +54 ) or by site-directed mutagenesis ( pA256R-CAT , pA3OR-CAT , pA11R-CAT ) : the -870 to +54 region subcloned in M13mp9 was used as a template for mutagenesis using the Amersham `` oligo-nucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system . ''
Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis created a HindIII restriction site at the desired location .
The HindlIII-BamHI fragments were subsequently subcloned in pBLCAT3 .
The oligonucleotides used were the following : -870 , 55 TGCTAG-TAGTCTGTCCCCCA 3 '' ; +54 , 55 CTTCCAAAGCGTGGAACTGT 3 ' ; -105 , 5 GATGAAAGCTTCACAACAGGCAGTCCTTGA 3 ' ; -62 , 5 GATGAAAGCTTGGGGCTGCCTGCTGGGTGT 3 ' ; -256 , 5 ' ATTGAAGAGAAGCTTAGGTGTATT 3 ; -30 , 5 TTATCT-GAGGAAGCTTGAGAATAGAAA 3 '' ; -11 , 55 GTGTACCCTAAAA GCTTGTCTTATCTG 3 ' .
Mutated constructs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the -62 to +54 fragments subcloned in M13mp9 as templates .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides are presented in Figs .
3 and 4 .
All the constructs were sequenced before use .
Construction of Expression Vectors-Plasmids that constitutively express hGATA-1 and PGAA were constructed using the pECE vector ( 29 ) where the inserted cDNAs are transcriptionally directed by the SV40 promoter and enhancer .
An EcoRI DNA fragment containing 120 bp of the 5'-untranslated region , the complete coding region , as well as 60 bp of the 3 ' -untranslated region of hGATA-1 was inserted at the unique EcoRI site of the pECE vector ( pGATA-1 ) , and its orientation relative to the SV40 promoter/enhancer was checked by a BamHI digestion .
pGAA , a hGATA-1 mutant that contained no zinc finger , was obtained by an Apal digestion of hGATA-1 and ligation .
This results in a conserved open reading frame through hGATA-1 but a deletion of the two zinc fingers .
PKB104 that allows in vitro transcription and translation of TFIID was a gift of Dr. John Ham ( 30 ) .
The above-mentioned fragment of hGATA-1 was inserted by Xbal , Sall in pBluescript II SK- ( pBS-GATA-1 ) for in vitro transcription and translation of hGATA-1 .
Transfection Experiments-10 '' K562 , HEL , or HeLa cells were electroporated in a volume of 180 Ll of phosphate-buffered saline-Hepes ( 10 mm , pH 7.4 ) by a single pulse of 200 V at 960 uF with a Gene Pulser Apparatus ( Bio-Rad ) .
10 ug of reporter gene plasmid and 2 ug of the Rous sarcoma virus luciferase plasmid ( 31 ) were added .
In the case of transactivation in HeLa cells , 5 ug of a GATA-1 expression vector ( pGATA-1 or pGAA ) was also added .
Twenty four hours after transfection , the cells were harvested and lysed in 100 Ll of 250 mm Tris , 0.2 % Triton X-100 , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 10 % glycerol , pH 7.8 .
CAT activity was assayed by measuring conversion of [ `` *C ] chloramphenicol to acetylated forms by thin layer chromatog-raphy ( 32 ) .
The rate of acetylation was determined by cutting out the silica gel pieces corresponding to the acetylated and nonacetylated forms and counting `` *C radioactivity .
Differences in transfection efficiency were appreciated by the co-transfection of RSVL plasmid and determination of luciferase activity ( 33 ) .
The lysate volumes used for the determination of CAT activity were in inverse ratio to the luciferase activity .
When the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) was tested , a double amount of cells was electroporated and split 1 h after electroporation .
TPA was added to one half at a final concentration of 16 nM .
As luciferase expression was stimulated by TPA R-PK Promoter Regulatory Elements ( driven by Rous sarcoma virus-long term repeat ) , the amount of lysate from TPA-treated samples used for CAT assay was adjusted toward that of the control samples according to protein concentration .
DNase I Footprinting and Gel Shift Assays-Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al .
( 34 ) from exponentially growing cells DNase I footprinting was performed as previously described ( 35 ) using an amplified fragment that spans nucleotides -229 to +54 relative to the cap site .
Gel shift assays for CCACC/Spl and GATA proteins from nuclear extracts were performed using the indicated end-labeled oligonucleotides ( 36 ) .
Gel shift assays with in vitro-translated TFIID and GATA proteins were performed as described in Ref .
30 with the modification that no nonspecific competitor was added .
In Vitro Transcriptions and Translations-In vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed using Promega reagents according to the manufacturer .
For TFIID transcription , pKB104 was linearized at a KpnI site downstream of the open reading frame and transcribed with T ; RNA polymerase .
For hGATA-1 transcription , pBS-GATA-1 was linearized at an Xbal site and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase .
Translation was performed using a nu-clease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate and an amino acid mixture containing [ ( *S ) methionine so as to label the synthesized proteins .
RESULTS An 870-bp DNA Fragment from the 5 Region of the R-PK Gene Confers Erythroid Specificity to a Reporter Gene-A rat genomic clone encoding both the R- and L-type PK has been isolated and sequenced ( 4 ) .
Using the published sequence , we amplified a 924-bp DNA fragment spanning nucleotides -870 to +54 relative to the R-PK cap site .
This fragment was sequenced and cloned upstream of the CAT coding sequence in the vector plasmid pBLCAT3 .
The resulting plasmid was called pR-CAT .
To investigate the cellular specificity of pR-CAT expres-sion , this plasmid was transiently transfected either in erythroid ( K562 or HEL ) or nonerythroid ( HeLa ) cell lines .
The CAT activity was determined 24 h after transfection and compared to the activity obtained with the parental vector .
The transfection efficiency of each assay was taken into account as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
As shown in Table I , the level of expression of pR-CAT is similar to the parental vector one in HeLa cells while it was , respec-tively , 18- and 8-fold higher than the parental vector one in K562 and HEL cell lines .
We also investigated the effect of TPA on the activity of pR-CAT .
TPA is known to induce a down-regulation of erythroid-specific gene activity , and this effect is partially transcriptional ( 26 , 37 ) .
TPA treatment reduced expression nearly 8-fold in K562 cells suggesting that this DNA fragment contains the cis-acting sequences which mediate the TPA effect ( Table 1 ) .
The Promoter Region of R-PK Gene Contains Multiple Binding Sites for Nuclear Factors-To map binding sites for nuclear factors , a DNA fragment spanning nucleotide -229 to TABLE I Expression of a R-PK promoter ( -870 to +54 ) -CAT construct in erythroid and nonerythroid cell lines pRCAT was transfected in the different cell lines as indicated under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
CAT activity was expressed as the rate of acetylation obtained from pR-CAT plasmid versus the rate obtained from the promoter-less control plasmid ( pBL-CAT3 ) taking into account the transfection efficiency of each experiment as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''

Cell line CAT activity K562 18 + 1.1 K562 + TPA 2.4 + 0.6 HEL 8 + 2.3 Hela 1 + 0.2 R-PK Promoter Regulatory Elements +54 relative to the cap site was analyzed by DNase I footprint-ing .
Five protected sequences were found : three of them ( A , D , E ) were strongly protected by nuclear extracts from erythroid cell lines ( Fig .
1A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Region E was also weakly protected by HeLa nuclear extract ( Fig .
1A , lane 3 ) .
Regions B and C were protected by nuclear extracts from erythroid ( Fig .
1A , lanes 4 and 5 ) and nonerythroid ( Fig .
14 , lane 3 ) cell lines .
A map of the different footprints as they occur in the presence of erythroid nuclear extract is shown in Fig .
1B .
A DNA Fragment Spanning Nucleotides -62 to +54 of the R-PK Gene Is Sufficient for Erythroid-specific Activity-To determine the function of the different DNA binding sites in the erythroid-specific activity of R-PK promoter , a set of deletion mutants was constructed and tested in transient transfection assay in erythroid and nonerythroid cell lines .
As shown in Fig .
2 , all the mutants tested were completely inactive in HeLa cells .
In erythroid cells , similar activities were obtained with pA62R-CAT , pA105R-CAT , and pR-CAT , suggesting that a minimal promoter of 62 bases was sufficient for erythroid-specific activity .
In the presence of TPA , there was no more expression of pA105R-CAT and pA62R-CAT in K562 cells , showing that these two constructs contained DNA sequences mediating the TPA effect .
Mutant pA256R-CAT gave a low level of CAT activity , suggesting the presence of a silencer element between -256 and -105 .
This silencer was not studied further .
Promoters smaller than pA62R-CAT have a very low ( pA30R-CAT ) or no CAT activity at all ( pA1lR-CAT ) .
Consequently , pA62R-CAT was studied further as the minimal promoter that displayed erythroid-specific activity .
GATA and CCACC Proteins Bind the -62 to +54 DNA Fragment-To further analyze the nuclear factors that bind the -62 to +54 DNA fragment , gel shift assays were performed with oligonucleotides containing sites A and B .
Site A sequence ( Fig .

The regions protected only by erythroid extracts are underlined with continuous lines while the regions protected by erythroid or nonerythroid nuclear extracts are underlined with dotted lines .
5433 served in the presence of HEL nuclear extracts .
The migration of the complexes obtained with site A oligonucleotide and the already known GATA site of glycophorin B ( GpB ) was similar ( Fig .
3B , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Site A binding was impaired by competition with an excess of unlabeled site A or GpB oligonucleotide ( Fig .
3B , lanes 4 and 5 ) , while unlabeled site A oligonucleotide impaired GpB binding ( Fig .
3B , lane 2 ) .
These experiments demonstrate the specific GATA binding of site A .
Site B sequence ( Fig .
44 ) matches the CCACC/Sp1 binding sequence .
In the presence of HEL nuclear extracts , gel mobility-shift assay with a 5'-end-labeled oligonucleotide containing site B showed complexes reminiscent of those obtained with the CCACC sequence of the human 3-globin promoter ( Fig .
4B , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Only a part of these complexes was present when a Spl binding sequence was used ( Fig .
4B , lane 4 ) .
Competition experiments with an excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide encompassing the /3-globin CCACC sequence or the site B sequence entailed a complete disappearance of the complexes previously obtained with site B oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4B , lanes 5 and 7 ) , while a competition with an excess of Spl binding oligonucleotide allowed the persistence of the lower molecular weight complex ( Fig .
4B , lane 6 ) , indicating its specificity as a CCACC binding complex .
Similar results were obtained in the presence of HeLa nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that site B could bind members of the CCACC/Sp1 family .
CCACC and Sp1 Binding Sites Allow the Erythroid-specific Activity of the R-PK Promoter-As one complex was specific to the CCACC binding proteins , we could design a mutated oligonucleotide ( mutant 1 , Fig .
4A ) which could bind Sp1 but not CCACC proteins ( Fig .
4B , lane 2 ) .
This oligonucleotide was used for site-directed mutagenesis of pA62R-CAT , and the activity of the resulting mutant promoter ( pA62R-CATmutl ) was investigated by transient transfection .
As shown in Table II , pA62R-CATmutl1 activity was 60 % of pAG2R-CAT activity in erythroid cell lines .
There was no expression of pA62R-CATmut1 in HeLa cells .
Thus , both Sp1 and CCACC binding allow the activity of the R-PK promoter , although the CCACC binding seems more efficient .
The GATA Binding Site Is Necessary for the Erythroid-specific Activity of the R-PK Promoter-The position ( -20 ) and sequence of the GATA binding site ( 5 AGATAA 3 '' ) of the R-PK promoter prompted us to consider a possible overlap between a GATA and a TFIID binding site .
First , we have studied , by gel mobility-shift assay , the binding of in vitro translated human TFIID and GATA-1 on oligonucleotides bearing the R-PK GATA site and the E1B TATA box ( 30 ) .
The in vitro translated hTFIID and hGATA-1 were present at the expected molecular weight on SDS-acrylamide electro-phoresis ( data not shown ) .
When a reticulocyte lysate without exogenously added RNA was used , a nonspecific band was seen with all probes used ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 and 6 ) .
There was a specific binding of GATA-1 on GATA probe ( Fig .
5 , lane 2 ) which was competed by an excess of unlabeled GATA probe ( Fig .
5 , lane 5 ) .
Similarly , there was a binding of hTFIID on the E1B TATA box ( Fig .
5 , lane 8 ) which was competed by an excess of unlabeled E1B TATA box oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5 , lane 10 ) .
However , hGATA-1 could not bind to the E1B TATA box ( Fig .
5 , lane 7 ) , and hTFIID could not bind to the -20 R-PK GATA binding site ( Fig .
5 , lane 3 ) .
In the case of the translation of hTFIID and hGATA-1 by the same reticulocyte lysate , there was no difference in the mobility shift indicating no stable association of the two factors on either probe ( Fig .
5 , lanes 4 and 9 ) .

oligonucleotide and TFIID protein was observed ( Fig .

These two oligonucleotides were used for site-directed mutagenesis of the pA62R-CAT construct , and the two mutated promoters were studied by transient transfection ( Table II ) .
Mutations 2 and 3 abolished CAT activity in erythroid cells while they did not allow the promoter activity in HeLa cells .
These results clearly demonstrate that GATA-1 and TFIID are not mutual substitutes as DNA binding factor on the -20 GATA sequence of the R-PK promoter .

Promoter in a Nonerythroid Cell Line-As the R-PK promoter was inactive in HeLa cells and active in erythroid cells , we studied its possible transactivation by hGATA-1 .
As shown in Table III , all the constructs containing a GATA binding site were transactivated 2- to 3-fold , and the constructs lacking the GATA binding site were not transactivated .
However , as demonstrated by the similar results obtained for the transactivation of pAG2R-CAT and pA30R-CAT , the presence or the absence of the CCACC/Sp1 binding site did not affect the hGATA-1-mediated transactivation in HeLa cells .
This result contrasts with the sequence requirement for an efficient activity of the R-PK promoter in erythroid cells and indicates that transactivation in HeLa cells might not completely mimic the mechanisms that underlie the erythroid specificity of the pA62R-CAT construct .
5435 TABLE III Transactivation by hGATA-1 HeLa cells were transfected with either pGATA-1 or pGAA associated to the mentioned constructs as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''

We have shown that a 62-bp promoter fragment from the R-PK gene is sufficient for erythroid-specific expression of a reporter gene in transient transfection assay .
This fragment contains a CCACC/Sp1 binding site around -50 associated to a GATA binding site around -20 .
Such an association of potential binding sites for a ubiquitous protein and a GATA-1 protein is common to many promoters and regulatory elements of erythroid-specific genes ( 38 ) .
For instance , it has been described for promoters of human porphobilinogen deaminase ( 35 , 39 , 40 ) , murine erythropoietin receptor ( 41 ) , human 3-globin ( 42 ) , mouse GATA-1 ( 43 ) , and in locus control region DNase I hypersensitive site 2 of human 8 gene cluster ( 38 , 44 ) .
Deletion of the CCACC/Sp1 binding site ( pA30R-CAT ) reduced promoter expression to 10 % in K562 cells .
These results are similar to those obtained by the deletion of the CCACC site of human PBGD promoter ( 18 % , Ref .
40 ) , the mutation of the CCACC site of mouse GATA-1 promoter ( 22 % , Ref .
43 ) , or the mutation of the Sp1 site of the mouse erythropoietin receptor ( 16 % , Ref .
41 ) .
However , the respective involvement of CCACC or Sp1 proteins is not completely cleared up : pA62R-CATmut1 , which only allows Sp1 binding , displays a 40 % lessening of promoter expression .
As the different forms of CCACC boxes that have been described are always Spl binding sites ( 45 ) , it has not been possible to design a mutated site retaining only the CCACC binding .
So the respective functions of Spl and CCACC proteins are hard to determine .
The actual role of these proteins in vivo should be in relation with their respective affinity for site B and their intracellular concentration .
The withdrawal of GATA binding by point mutations abolished the expression of R-PK promoter in the case of mutant 2 , where the GATA site was simply suppressed , as well as in the case of mutant 3 where the GATA site was substituted by a consensus TFIID binding site .
There have been some arguments in favor of the function of GATA-1 in transcriptional initiation ( 46 ) .
For instance , the noncanonical TATA box of the chicken 8-globin gene is a site for GATA-1 binding ( 47 ) .
On account of the similarity of position and sequence of site A with a TATA box , we become interested in studying the consequences of the substitution of the GATA site by a TATA box and the binding specificity of the two motifs .
Replacing the GATA site by a TATA box reduces the promoter expression to almost baseline in erythroid cells and does not allow 5436 expression in Hela cells .
These results are in contrast with those obtained for the rat platelet factor 4 gene promoter for which substitution of a GATA site by a TATA box allows megakaryocytic expression but entails a loss of tissue specificity ( 48 ) .
Possibly , these different results are the consequence of different functions of GATA-1 in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells .
It is also interesting to collate our results with those obtained in the study of the expression of the chicken B-globin gene ( 47 ) .
Two GATA sites are involved in the regulation of the chicken $ -globin gene transcription , one located at -30 , the other located in the distal 3 ' enhancer .
The substitution of the -30 GATA site by a TATA box reduces by 3-fold the in vivo activity of the promoter but does not impair its in vitro transcription while a similar mutation in R-PK promoter nearly abolished erythroid expression .
Band shift experiments demonstrate a strong binding of cGATA-1 and a weak binding of hTFIID on the -30 chicken B-globin GATA site , while R-PK site A binds hGATA-1 but does not bind hT'FIID .
In the case of chicken B-globin transcription , the authors propose that , in a first step , cGATA-1 binds to the -30 site and interacts with cGATA-1 or other proteins bound to the 3 ' enhancer , allowing the subsequent displacement of the -30 bound cGATA-1 by a TFIID-adaptor complex .
Such a model can not be applied to the R-PK promoter which is efficiently expressed in the absence of an enhancer element and in which the direct binding on the GATA site of TFIID alone or in association with GATA-1 seems unlikely or too unstable in the absence of other nuclear components to be displayed .
Pugh and Tjian ( 49 , 50 ) have implicated TFIID complexing through co-activators and a tethering factor in the activation by Spl of a TATA-less promoter .
Such a complex could be speculated in the transcription activator function of GATA-L .
Throughout this work , we have assumed that the only GATA protein involved in R-PK promoter expression was GATA-1 .
GATA-1 is a member of a zinc finger family of DNA-binding proteins whose members recognize a sequence T/AGATAG/A .
In chicken , three mRNAs coding for GATA proteins have been described .
GATA-1 mRNA is very abundant in erythroid cells , GATA-2 mRNA is present in erythroid cells and in several other tissues , and GATA-3 mRNA is restricted to developing brain and T lymphocytes ( 51 ) .
In humans , GATA-1 mRNA has been assigned to erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cells ( 52 , 53 ) .
GATA-2 mRNA is present in a wide variety of cell types including HeLa , K562 , and HEL cells ( 54 , 55 ) used in this study .
Among hemato-poietic cells , GATA-3 mRNA is restricted to T cells ( 56 ) .
Despite the presence of GATA-2 mRNA in erythroid cells , it is most likely that GATA-1 is involved in R-PK promoter expression for several reasons : the relative abundance of the two mRNAs in erythroid cells ( 46 ) , the lack of protection of site A to DNase I in HeLa cells , and the fact that the R-PK promoter is inactive in HeLa cells that contain GATA-2 mRNA but is transactivated by GATA-1 in these same HeLa cells .
Forced expression of hGATA-1 in HeLa cells entails a specific activity of R-PK promoter constructs when an intact GATA motif is present .
The level of this transactivation ( 2-3-fold ) was low compared to the published results for synthetic promoter constructs ( 57 , 58 ) or erythropoietin receptor promoter ( 41 ) .
Conversely , no transactivation was obtained for the mouse GATA-1 gene promoter in NIH-3T3 ( 43 ) or the entire human -globin gene or the y-globin promoter ( 57 ) .
The authors invoke the requirement for additional tissue-restricted factors ( 57 ) which also might be involved in R-PK promoter function , although less drastically .
The fact that the R-PK Promoter Regulatory Elements presence or the absence of the CCACC/Sp1 binding site does not influence the level of the hGATA-1 transactivation in HeLa cells , while it is essential in erythroid-specific promoter activity , also argues in favor of the need of additional factors as the occurrence of a very low level of expression of the different R-PK promoter constructs ( 1-3-fold the basal level , data not shown ) in the megakaryocytic cell line MEG-O1 , which expresses the GATA-1 protein ( 53 ) .
The inhibiting effect of TPA on the expression of R-PK promoter is maintained in pA62R-CAT .
Owing to the structure of this core promoter , GATA-1 could be an intermediate of this effect as TPA has been shown to down-regulate this factor ( 37 ) .
It was also demonstrated that TPA increases the expression of the megakaryocytic markers in K562 cells ( 59 ) .
So , it is tempting to speculate that a common factor is implicated in the repression of R-PK promoter in MEG-O1 cells and TPA-treated K562 cells and that the effect of TPA is mediated by several events , including down-regulation of GATA-1 and effects on factors which do not bind the DNA .
In summary , the present study demonstrated that a short promoter fragment ( 62 bp ) is sufficient to mediate an erythroid tissue specificity and a substantial level of expression .
This very simple promoter could be a useful tool in a more acute study of initiation of transcription , including , for instance , the search for interaction between tissue-specific and general transcription factors .
