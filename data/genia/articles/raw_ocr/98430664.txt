Masuda , * Yoshiyuki Naito , * Shin-ichiro Imai , '' Tadahiro Fujino , '' Toshiya Takano , '' Ken-ichi Arai , * and Naoko Arai'* NFAT regulates transcription of a number of cytokine and other immunoregulatory genes .
We have isolated NFATx , which is one of four members of the NFAT family of transcription factors and is preferentially expressed in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes , and an isoform of NFATx , NFATx1 .
Here we provide evidence showing that 15 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal end of NFATx1 are required for its maximum transactivation activity in Jurkat T cells .
A fusion between these 15 amino acids and the GAL4 DNA binding domain was capable of transactivating reporters driven by the GAL4 DNA binding site .
Interestingly , this 15-amino acid transactivation sequence is well conserved in NFAT family proteins , although the sequences contiguous to the carboxyl-terminal regions of the NFAT family are much less conserved .
We also report three additional isoforms of NFAT ' x , designated NFATx2 , NFATx3 , and NFATx4 .
This transactivation sequence is altered by tissue-specific alternative splicing in newly isolated NFAT ' x isoforms , resulting in lower transactivation activity in Jurkat T cells .
NFATx1 is expressed predominantly in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocyte , while the skeletal muscle expressed primarily NFATx2 .
In Jurkat cells , transcription from the NFAT site of the IL-2 promoter is activated strongly by NFATx1 but only weakly by NFATx2 .
These data demonstrate that the 15-amino acid sequence of NFATx1 is a major transactivation sequence required for induction of genes by NFATx1 in T cells and possibly regulates NFAT activity through tissue-specific alternative splicing .
The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 3455- 3463. specific transcription factor in the IL-2 promoter system ( 1 ) , is thought to regulate transcriptional induction of the early immune response genes , such as those for IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , granulocyte-macrophage-CSF , TNF-a , CD40 ligand , and Fas ligand ( 2-4 ) .
NFAT consists of two components : a pre-exist-ing cytoplasmic component , which translocates into the nucleus upon calcium mobilization , and an inducible nuclear component composed of members of the activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) * family of transcription factors ( 5 , 6 ) .
Translocation of the cytoplasmic component is dependent on the activity of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and is sensitive to the actions of the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 ( 2 , 7 , 8 ) .
The search for genes encoding cytoplasmic components of NFAT , collectively termed NFAT family proteins , led to the isolation of four distinct cDNAs that shared sequence similarities .

Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists They encoded proteins that were named NFATI ( NFATp ) , NFATc , NFATx/NFATA4/NFATc3 , and NFAT3 ( 9-13 ) .
All four NFAT proteins can activate transcription driven by the NFAT site from the IL-2 promoter ( 9-12 ) .
However , the individual roles of NFAT family proteins in regulating gene expression are still un-clear .
NFAT family proteins are characterized by a highly homol-ogous domain , which is weakly related to the DNA binding domain of Rel family proteins ( 9 , 10 , 14 , 15 ) .
The existence of this characteristic Rel similarity domain allowed us to divide NFAT family proteins into three distinct regions : an amino-terminal region , a carboxyl-terminal region , and a middle region containing the Rel similarity domain .
The main function of the Rel similarity domain is DNA binding and protein-protein interactions with the AP-1 family of transcription factors .
Indeed , the Rel similarity domains from all four NFAT family proteins are capable of binding cooperatively with AP-1 family proteins at the IL-2 promoter NFAT site ( 9 , 12 , 14 , 16 ) .
On the other hand , the amino-terminal region of NFATI ( NFATp ) and NFATx/NFAT4 is important and sufficient for binding to calcineurin and seems to regulate nuclear translocation ( 16-18 ) .
The amino-terminal region shows signifi-cant , albeit weak , sequence similarity among NFAT family proteins and is characterized by the presence of three perfect repeats for NFATI ( NFATp ) , NFATc , and NFATx and one for NFAT3 , containing the sequence SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX ( D , E ) ( D , E ) , referred to as SP boxes ( 10 ) .
Finally , in contrast to the middle and the amino-terminal regions , little is known about the carboxyl-terminal region , which shows no significant sequence similarities .
Moreover , the carboxyl-terminal region is absent in the NFATc protein ( 12 ) .
Recently , we cloned a cDNA encoding a member of the NFAT family proteins , referred to as NFAT ' x , and showed that NFAT specifically bound the NFAT binding sequence , that it was capable of 0022-1767/98/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3456 activating the IL-2 promoter , and that this molecule was expressed predominantly in the thymus ( 10 ) .
In the present work we identified a 15-amino acid transactivation sequence in the carboxy-terminal end of NFAT ' x .
In addition , we isolated cDNAs encoding three isoforms of NFATx , ie. , NFATx2 , NFATx3 , and NFATx4 .
NFATx was renamed NFATx1 .
Interestingly , these isoforms have altered carboxyl-terminal ends and lost NFATx1 transactivation sequence , which explains the strong transactivation activity of NFATx1 compared with those of the other isoforms .
Materials and Methods cDNA cloning cDNAs encoding NFATx2 and NFATx3 were isolated by screening Jurkat cDNA libraries in AZiplox ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) as previously described ( 10 ) .
NFATx4 was isolated by screening a cDNA library obtained from T Ag-transformed human diploid fibroblasts ( 19 ) , using as a probe a DNA fragment spanning the whole Rel similarity domain of human NFATI ( NFATp ) .
Five positive cDNA clones , which had a fragment of approximately 3 kb , were identified as encoding the new member , designated NFATx4 .
Plasmid constructions NFATx2 and NFATx3 isoforms and NFATx1 deletion expression plasmids were constructed using pME-NFATx as a starting plasmid .
pME-NFATx is expression plasmid for NFATx1 under the control of the SR « promoter in vector pME18S and has been described previously ( 10 ) ; it was renamed pME-NFATx1 in this study .
The fragment ( positions 2044-3152 according to the sequence of Masuda et al .
( 10 ) ) of pME-NFATx1 was replaced by the corresponding fragments containing NFATx2- or NFATx3-specific sequences for pME-NFATx2 or pME-NFATx3 .
For the construction of pME-NFATx1ACAA , pME-NFATx1ACPS , and pME-NFATx1AC , a part of the carboxyl-terminal coding region of pME-NFATx1 was deleted by Af ! III ( position 3152 ) , Psfl ( position 3110 ) , and BsfEII ( position 2298 ) digestion , respectively .
The plasmid pME-NFATx1ACBA was made by deleting most of the carboxyl1-terminal coding region of NFATx1 ( positions 2298-3152 ) using BsfEII and For construction of pME-NFATx1ACBP , the 156-bp Psfl fragment ( positions 3110-3266 ) from the very end of the carboxyl-terminal coding region of the pME-NFATx1 was ligated into the BsfEII site on the pME-NFATx1AC .
pME-NFATx4 was formed by ligation of the EcoRI fragment , which contained full-length NFATx4 , into the EcoRI site of pME18S .
Plasmid pNFAT72Luc was constructed by inserting three copies of the murine IL-2 promoter NFAT site ( -290 to -261 ) into the Bg/lI site of the pmoIL-2-72Luc ( 20 ) .
All plasmids for fusions between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and NFATx1 were constructed using pM in the TransAct Assay Kit ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) as a starting plasmid .
For construction of pGAL4-X1BB , pGALA4-X2BB , and pGALA-XIPP , the BstEII fragment from pME-NFATx1 or -NFATx2 and the Psfl fragment ( positions 3110-3226 ) from pME-NFATx1 were ligated into the Smal site of pM , respectively .
pGAL4-X1PA was made by AffIH partial digestion of pGAL4-X1PP .
For the construction of pG5Luc , which is a reporter plasmid with five GAL4 DNA binding sites , the Pvull fragment ( positions 308-736 ) from pGSCAT in the Trans Act assay kit was ligated into the Smal site of pUCOQLuc ( 21 ) .
To form pGAL4-X1WT , synthesized primer ( 21-mer 5'-CCGGAATTCGACATCACTTITTA-3 ' ) and template ( 54-mer 5'-TTAT CTAGACATGTCTCTCCCAATTATCTCGTTCACATCATCTAAAGTG ATGTC-3 ' ) were annealed and filled in with Klenow fragment .
After digestion with EcoRI and Xbeal , this fragment was ligated into the EcoRI Xbal site of pM plasmid .
For alanine substitution of 15-amino acid frans-activation sequence ( pGAL4-X1 M1~pGAL4-X1 M10 ) , mutant 54-mer templates were used , which contain nucleotides instead of wild-type nucleotides encoding one of 15 amino acid residues .
DNA transfections Transfection of Jurkat cells or 293 cells was performed by the DEAE-dextran method ( 22 ) or the calcium phosphate precipitation method ( 23 ) , respectively .
Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection of pCMV/SEAP ( Tropix , Bedford , MA ) for Jurkat cells and pBC12/RSV/ SEAP ( Tropix ) for 293 cells .
The plasmids pCMV/SEAP and pBC12/RSV/ SEAP contain the CMV promoter/enhancer and the RSV long terminal repeat driving secreted alkaline phosphatase expression , respectively .
For transfection into Jurkat cells , 1 X 10° cells were transfected with 3 ug of reporter plasmid pNFAT72Luc , 3 pg of internal control plasmid pCMV/ SEAP , and 6 ug of NFATx1 deletion expression plasmid ( pME- TRANSACTIVATION SEQUENCE OF NFATx1 NFATx1ACAA , _ pME-NFATx1ACPS , - pME-NFATx1AC , - pME-NFATx1ACBA , or pME-NFATx1ACBP ) or NFAT isoform expression plasmid ( pME-NFATx1 , pME-NFATx2 , pME-NFAT®3 , or NFATx4 ) .
Semiconfluent 293 cells ( 35-mm dish ) were transfected with 1 pg of reporter plasmid NFATLuc ( 20 ) or pGSLuc , 0.25 ug of internal control plasmid pBC12/RSV/SEAP ( Tropix ) , and 2 ug of GAL4 fusion expression plasmid ( pGAL4-X1BB , pGAL4-XI1PP , pGAL4-XIPA , pGAL4-X1WT , or pGAL4-X1 M1~pGAL4-X1 M10 ) or NFATx isoform expression plasmid .
The transfection assay was repeated at least three times , and luciferase activity was normalized to protein mass and alkaline phosphatase activity .
RT-PCR analysis Total RNA ( 2 ug ) from Jurkat cells was isolated using an RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) .
Poly ( A ) * RNAs ( 0.5 ug ) from thymus , skeletal muscle , and kidney were purchased from Clontech ( Palo Alto , CA ) .
The RNA was reverse transcribed at 42°C , using the Superscript preamplifica-tion system ( Life Technologies ) in a 20-pl reaction mixture as described by the manufacturer .
For PCR amplification , 1 pl of the cDNA synthesis mixture described above was used .
Primer pairs used for RT-PCR of NFATx mRNA isoforms were sense 20-mer P1 ( 5-CTGGACAGCACT CAACTCAA-3 ' ) , which is common for all NFATx mRNA isoforms , and antisense 20-mer P2 ( 5-CTGGACATGAGAGCACACTG-3 ' ) , P3 ( 5'-GCCAAAACGTAGGTCTCAAC-3 ' ) , or P4 ( 5-TGAACTCCTGACCIT GTGAT-3 ' ) , which are specific for NFATx2 , NFATx3 , and NFATx4 , respectively .
An antisense 18-mer P5 ( 5'-CCTTGGGAAACAGAAATC3 ' ) was also used with P1 to check relative expression of NFATx2 and NFATx3 to NFATx1 .
The cDNA was amplified for 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55°C , and PCR products were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 3 % NuSieve agarose gels ( FMC Bioproducts , Rockland , ME ) .
Northern blot analysis Northern ( RNA ) blots of poly ( A ) * RNA from different human tissues were purchased from Clontech ( no .
7759-1 , lot 58630 , and no .
7760-1 , lot 58500 ) .
The blots contained 2 ug of poly ( A ) * RNA/lane , and the quality of RNA was controlled by the manufacturer by hybridization of a representative blot for each lot of RNA with a human B-actin control probe .
To detect all mRNA isoforms of NFATx , we used a cDNA probe spanning the NFATx sequence ( positions 1156-2614 ) ( 10 ) .
For the NFATx2 isoform , a 243-bp DNA fragment was generated from the plasmid pME-NFATx2 by PCR using oligonucleotides and 5-GGCTGCAGTAAGCACTGTTA-3 ' for the sense and antisense prim-ers , respectively .
The 243-bp fragment was purified and cloned into the pCRII vector ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) , and the 106-bp EcoRI-Xbel fragment was used for the NFATx2-specific hybridization probe .
DNA probes were labeled by random priming , and hybridization was conducted in Quick Hyb Hybridization Solution ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) with 200 ug/tal salmon sperm DNA at 68°C for 1.5 h. The filter was washed in 2 % SSC/0.1 % SDS at room temperature and subsequently in 0.1 % SSC/0.1 % SDS at 60°C , then exposed to x-ray film .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) EMSAs were conducted with 10-Lg protein extracts as described previously ( 24 ) .
The oligonucleotides used in EMSAs contained the following sequence ( only one strand is shown ; sequence overhangs are in lower case ) : NFAT site from the human IL-2 ( 25 ) , 5-gatecGGAGGAAAACT GTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3 ' .
Extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were prepared , and fractions containing purified AP-1 were obtained as described previously ( 24 ) .
Results Identification of an essential domain in NFATx1 carboxyl terminus for its transactivation activity We recently reported domain analysis of NFATx1 and found that transcriptional activation mediated by NFATx1 was significantly reduced by deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain ( 16 ) .
This observation focused our attention on the carboxyl-terminal region of NFATx1 in terms of transactivation function .
We then made a series of constructs deleting part of this region from NFATx1 and checked transactivation in Jurkat cells by measuring the luciferase activity of the extract of Jurkat cells that was cotransfected with the reporter plasmid pNFAT72Luc and with either an expression plasmid of the deleted NFATx1 carboxyl-terminal region or the 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology A 1075 1076 1 ) _ 104 gortuopyiEr tonne X1 ACAA 1028 X1 ACPS B C3 ewsenl cs a E a 8 B B x1 ACBP 7 I f I I | 760 I x1 1 ACBA | I D3 [ FIGURE 1 .
Fifteen amino acid residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of NFATx1 are essential ( A ) and sufficient ( B ) for frans-activation activity in Jurkat cells .
A schematic representation of the structure of NFATx1 is shown ( see also Fig .
3 ) .
Jurkat cells were transfected with 3 ug of the reporter plasmid pNFAT72Luc , 3 pg of the internal control plasmid pCMV/SEAP , and 6 ug of the expression plasmids containing several deletions in the carboxyl-terminal region of NFATx1 .
Transfected cells were stimulated with PMA and calcium ionophore for 8 h before harvesting .

empty vector ( pME18S ) .
The plasmid pCMV/SEAP was used as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency .
The transfected Jurkat cells were incubated at 37°C for 40 h and stimulated with a combination of PMA and A23187 for 8 h before harvest ( Fig .
14 ) .
The expression plasmid containing a deletion of 31 amino acids from the end of NFATx1 ( pME-NFATx1ACAA ) still conferred the same transactivation activity as the full-length construct of NFATx1 ( pME-NFATx1 ) .
On the other hand , the expression plasmid containing a 47-amino acid deletion from the end of NFATx1 ( pME-NFATx1ACPS ) showed a severely decreased transactivation activity compared with pME-NFATx1 .
These results clearly indicated that the 16-amino acid sequence of NFATx1 ( QDITLDDVNEIIGRDM ) were important for transactivation activity mediated by NFATx1 .
To prove that these amino acid residues in the NFATx1 carboxyl terminus were sufficient for its transactivation activity , we checked the transactivation activities of different deletion constructs lacking other parts of the carboxyl terminus .
As shown in Figure 1B , the expression construct pME-NFATx1AC , which had most of the carboxyl-terminal domain of NFATx1 deleted , conferred no increase in transactivation activity .
Interestingly , transfection of the expression plasmid pME-NFATx1ACBP , containing this deletion fused with the end of the carboxyl-terminal region , 3457 including the 15-amino acid sequence ( DITLDDVNEIIGRDM ) that we had identified , resulted in the same level of increased activity as pME-NFATx1 .
However , consistent with the previous results , the expression plasmid pME-NFATx1ACBA containing this large deletion fused with the end of that carboxyl terminus that lacked the 15-amino acid sequence conferred no increase in activity .
From these results , we conclude that the carboxyl-terminal region of NFATx1 has a role in its transactivation activity and that a sequence , consisting of the 15-amino acid sequence ( DITLDD VNEIGRDM ) , is essential and apparently sufficient for the transactivation activity mediated by NFATx1 in Jurkat cells .
The results also indicate that other sequences in the carboxyl terminus of NFATx1 can be deleted without detrimental effects on its transactivation activity as measured in our assays .
Transactivation sequence of NFATx1 To assess whether the 15 amino acid residues of NFATx1 we identified had any intrinsic transactivation potential , chimeric molecules were generated by fusing portions of the NFATx1 carboxyl-terminal sequence to the DNA binding domain of GALA ( Fig .
24 ) .
These constructs were assayed for their ability to transactivate reporters driven by GAL4 DNA binding sites in the human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells .
We included a pM vector that encodes only the GAL4 DNA binding domain as a negative control .
The results showed that the entire carboxyl-terminal region of NFATx1 ( amino acids 761-1075 ) was sufficient for transcriptional activation ( X1BB ) .
Moreover , 46-amino acid residues from the very end of the carboxyl terminus of NFATx1 ( amino acids 1030-1075 ) and 15-amino acid residues ( amino acids 1030-1044 ) were also found to activate transcription just as efficiently as the whole carboxyl-terminal region of NFATx1 did ( X1PP and X1PA ) .
These results indicate that the sequence , consisting of 15 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of NFATx1 , was an intrinsic transactivation sequence .
We further investigated this 15-amino acid transactivation sequence using a series of mutants that have one amino acid substitution to alanine from the X1PA GAL4 fusion protein .
These mutation constructs were assayed for their ability using transient transfection as described above .
As shown in Figure 2B , most of the amino acid residues we substituted , except asparagine ( M5 ) , were critical for the potential as a transactivation sequence .
Notably , the mutation on the hydrophobic residue ( leucine , valine , or isoleucine ) completely abrogated the intrinsic transactivation potential ( M1 , M4 , M7 , and M8 ) .
Isolation of mRNA isoforms for NFAT We previously reported the cloning of NFATx1 , a member of the NFAT family ( 10 ) .
During further screening for NFAT cDNA clones from the Jurkat cDNA library , we isolated two additional isoforms of NFATx , designated NFATx2 and NFATx3 .
These two clones had distinct 104- and 89-bp insertion sequences at the same position , position 3131 according to the sequence of Masuda et al .
( 10 ) , in the 3'-coding region of the NFATx1 cDNA sequence ( Fig .
3A ) .
The insertions , displaying no homology to sequence in NFATx1 or to any other sequence in the available databases , resulted in a frame shift and replacement of the most carboxyl-terminal 40 residues of the NFATx1 by 33 and 30 unrelated amino acids for NFATx2 and NFATx3 , respectively ( Fig .
3 , B and C ) .
We also screened a cDNA library obtained from T Ag-transformed human diploid fibroblast and isolated another NFATx cDNA , designated NFATx4 .
Similar to the other isoforms , the NFATx4 sequence was identical up to nucleotide position 3131 with the other isoforms , and the last 40 amino acid residues of NFATx1 were also replaced by 10 unrelated amino acids ( Fig .

Luciferase activity was assayed described in Figure 1 .
The data are averages for three independent experiments .

Nucleotide sequences were deposited in the GenBank sequence databank and are not shown here .
In short , we found four distinct cDNA clones of NFAT ' x , designated NFATx1 , NFATx2 , NFATx3 , and NFATx4 , which are most likely derived by alternative splicing at a common site in the coding sequence .
The absence of a consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences at the junctions ( position 3131 ) makes it unlikely that these isoforms represent incompletely spliced transcripts and likely that alternative ex-ons were used for these isoforms .
Verification of this hypothesis , however , awaits deciphering of the precise exonic structure of the NFATx gene .
Most interestingly , junctions for these isoforms are located in the 15-amino acid transactivation sequence that we identified in the NFATx1 .
Consequently , these three isoforms have different corresponding sequences to the transactivation sequence of NFATx1 .

Tissue distribution of NFATx mRNA isoforms Our previous report showed preferential expression of NFAT ' x in thymus and leukocytes ( 10 ) .
However , we noticed that when we used a newly designed cDNA probe ( positions 1156-2614 in the NFATx1 sequence ) that should hybridize to all four isoforms of NFATx , we could also find a reasonable hybridizing band with an apparent size of 7.0 kb in RNA from testis , ovary , skeletal muscle , and kidney ( Fig .

This result suggested that our previously The Journal of Immunology FIGURE 4 .

m m I 1.4- NFATx1 NFATx2 NFATx3 reported expression profile was specific to the NFATx1 isoform and that the tissue distributions of the other NFAT ' x isoforms were distinct .
To confirm the above observation , we performed an RT-PCR analysis that distinguished the newly isolated isoforms by the size of the resulting PCR product .
To amplify a specific segment of each NFAT ' x isoform , we used a primer pair in which one primer contained an NFATx2- , NFATx3- , or NFAT sequence ( Fig .
3A ) .
We did amplify a specific segment of NFATx2 or NFATx3 , but not of NFATx4 , using total RNA from Jurkat cells ( Fig .
4B , lane 6 ) .
This result indicated that both NFATx2 and NFATx3 , but not NFATx4 mRNA , were expressed in Jurkat T cells .
Since we are interested in the expression of NFAT isoforms , especially in skeletal muscle and kidney where NFATx1 was not strongly expressed , we next checked for the expression of these NFATx isoforms in thymus , skeletal muscle , and kidney using same RT-PCR analysis .
As shown in Figure 4B , lanes 7 to 9 , the NFATx2 segment was detected in all these tissues .
The NFATx3 segment was detected in thymus and kidney , but not in skeletal muscle .
The NFATx4 segment was detected in thymus and skeletal muscle , but not in kidney .
These results suggested that the expression patterns of NFAT ' x isoforms are distinct in those tissues .
To compare the relative expression levels of NFATx2 and NFATx3 mRNA to that of NFATx1 , we designed an oligonucleotide primer pair ( P1 and P5 ) amplifying a region that contained the common insertion site in the 3 ' coding region of NFAT ' x ( Fig .
3A ) .
Contrary to the RT-PCR analysis described above ( Fig .
4B ) , this primer pair should amplify NFATx1- , NFATx2- , and NFATx3-specific segments simultaneously .
The results using total RNA from Jurkat cells revealed two amplification products of 244 and 348 bp , which corresponded to NFATx1 and NFATx2 , re Leukocyte Colon Thymus « ae NFATx4 Jurkat 3459 C Jurkat Thymus Muscle Kidney $ o sg ?

Interestingly , the lower band corresponding to NFATx1 was dominant compared with the upper band , which corresponded to NFATx2 ( Fig .
4C , lane 2 ) .
In addition , this result did not change even if we used poly ( A ) * or total RNA from Jurkat cells that were treated with PMA and A23187 for 3 h ( data not shown ) .
Although we did amplify an NFATx3-specific segment using total RNA from Jurkat cells by RT-PCR with primer pair P1 and P3 ( Fig .
4B , lane 6 ) , we did not detect a band corresponding to NFATx3 ( 333 bp ) in this RT-PCR analysis using primer pair P1 and P5 , perhaps because the assay was not sensitive enough to detect the low amounts of specific NFATx3 mRNAs .
These results indicated that NFATx1 , NFATx2 , and NFATx3 mRNAs were expressed in Jurkat T cells and that NFATx1 appeared to be the predominant species .
We further investigated the relative expression of NFAT ' x isoforms in thymus , skeletal muscle , and kidney using same primers ( P1 and P5 ) as those used for RT-PCR analysis .
We detected the same two amplification products as in the Jurkat cells ( Fig .
4C , lanes 6 , 9 , and 12 ) .
Interestingly , the thymus and kidney exhibited basically the NFATx1 mRNA isoform ( lower band , lanes 6 and 12 ) , while skeletal muscle exhibited primarily the NFATx2 mRNA isoform ( upper band , lane 9 ) .
These results indicated that NFAT x1 and NFATx2 mRNA isoforms were expressed in those tissues , however with different ratios .
Again , we did not detect a band corresponding to NFAT x3 in these tissues by this analysis .
Judging from these results , although we did detect the specific NFATx3 mRNA ( Fig .
4B , lanes 6 , 7 , and 9 ) , the amount is very low compared with those of NFATx1 and NFATx2 mRNA in Jurkat cells , thymus , and kidney .
To compare the relative expression levels of the NFATx2 in various tissues , we then hybridized a human multiple tissue blot 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3460 with an NFATx2-specific probe consisting of the insertion sequence of NFATx2 cDNA .
NFATx2 mRNA , which had the same apparent size ( 7.0 kb ) as NFATx mRNA in Figure 4A , was detected very strongly in RNA from skeletal muscle and weakly in RNA from testis , spleen , thymus , prostate , ovary , small intestine , heart , placenta , and pancreas ( Fig .
41D ) .
We did not detect NFATx2 expression in kidney .
We also hybridized the same tissue blot with an NFATx3- or NFATx4-specific probe .
However , neither NFATx3 nor NFAT x4 mRNA was detected even in very low stringent washing conditions ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , the NFAT isoforms with altered carboxyl terminus are expressed dif-ferentially in different tissues , possibly generated by tissue-specific alternative splicing .
Transcriptional activity of NFATx isoforms It is interesting to determine whether the transcription activity of the NFAT ' x isoforms is modulated by alteration of last amino acid residues in Jurkat T cells as well as HEK 293 cells , since all three isoforms isolated in this study lack the transactivation sequence of NFATx1 .
The activity of the NFAT ' x isoforms was checked by the transient transfection assay described above .
The transfected Jurkat cells were then divided into three sets and incubated at 37°C for 40 h. The cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated either with PMA or with a combination of PMA and A23187 for 8 h before harvest .
The activity attributed to endogenous NFAT was detected as the increase in luciferase activity upon PMA/A23187 stimulation of cells transfected with only empty vector , pME18S ( Fig .
54 ) .
Cotransfection of NFATx1 with reporter plasmid caused increase in NFAT-dependent transactivation by eightfold over the endogenous NFAT activity .
Notably , transactivation activity mediated by NFATx2 , NFATx3 , or NFATx4 was markedly lower than that mediated by NFATx1 .
Stimulation by both PMA and A23187 was strictly required for transactivation in all cases ( data not shown ) .
We next checked the function of NFAT ' x isoforms by transient transfection in 293 cells , since fusion between the 15-amino acid transactivation sequence of NFATx1 and the GAL4 DNA binding domain was capable of transactivating reporters driven by the GALA DNA binding site in this cell ( Fig .
24 ) .
The expression plasmid of each NFATx isoform was cotransfected with the reporter plasmid NF-ATLuc , which contains the luciferase gene under the control of seven copies of the murine IL-2 distal NFAT site .
The plasmid pBC12/RSV/SEAP was also included to monitor for transfection efficiency .
Two sets of transfection were performed for each NFATx isoform and were incubated at 37°C for 40 h. One set was left without stimulation , while the other set was stimulated with PMA and A23187 for 8 h. Similar to results with Jurkat cells , the extract from cells transfected with pME-NFATx1 showed 10 times greater activity when cells were stimulated by PMA/A23187 compared with mock transfectant ( pME18S ) , whereas transfection with pME-NFATx2 , pME-NFATx3 , or pME-NFATx4 gave much lower activity compared with NFATx1 cDNA ( Fig .
5B ) .
It is unlikely that lower induction of luciferase activity by transfection of the NFATx isoform expression plasmid ( pME-NFATx2 , -NFATx3 , or -NFATx4 ) is due to a failure in expression , because comparable NFAT ' x isoform expression was confirmed by immunoblotting using an antiserum against a common peptide sequence of NFAT isoforms ( data not shown ) .
To test whether the NFATx2- , NFATx3- , or NFATx4-specific sequence affects NFATx DNA binding , we transfected an expression plasmid containing the full-length cDNA of NFATx isoforms into COS-7 cells and prepared nuclear and cytosolic extracts from the transiently transfected cells .

Comparison of the transactivation potentials of NFAT isoforms in Jurkat cells ( 4 ) and 293 cells ( B ) .
A , Jurkat cells were transfected with 3 ug of the reporter plasmid pNFAT72Luc , 3 pug of the internal control plasmid pCMV/SEAP , and 6 ug of the expression plasmid pME18S , pME-NFATx1 , pME-NFATx2 , pME-NFATx3 , and pME-NFATx4 .

Transfected cells were stimulated with PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )
and calcium ionophore ( 10 pg/ml ) for 293 cells and with PMA only or PMA and calcium ionophore for Jurkat cells for 8 h before harvesting .
Luciferase activity was assayed as described in Figure 1 .
The data are averages for three independent experiments .
C , DNA binding activity of NFAT ' x isoforms to the NFAT binding site from the human IL-2 promoter .
EMSAs were conducted with nuclear or cytosolic extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pME18S ( Mock ) , pME-NFATx1 , pME-NFATx2 , pME-NFATx3 , and pME-NFATx4 .
The presence or the absence of AP-1 ( derived from Jurkat cells ) is indicated .
( 16 ) revealed very similar levels of the NFATx isoform proteins in extracts of the transfected cells ( data not shown ) .
We also transfected the empty expression vector ( pME18S ) as a mock control .
EMSAs were then conducted with a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NFAT-binding site ( Fig .
5C ) .
The results demonstrated the presence of DNA binding activities in extracts from cells transfected with all NFAT ' x isoforms .
This activity was absent from cells transfected with the expression vector alone .
6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology In agreement with previous characterization of NFAT in T cells ( 5 , 6 ) , exogenous AP-1 polypeptides were needed to reconstitute NFAT binding by the cytoplasmic extract from NFAT-transfected cells .
Nuclear extracts , on the other hand , did not require exogenous AP-1 ( Fig .
5C ) .
These results collectively indicate that no difference was found in the characteristics of DNA binding to the NFAT site among NFATx isoforms and further support the idea that a 15-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl terminus of NFATx1 is important for transactivation activity in at least T cells ( Jurkat ) and kidney cells ( 293 ) .
Discussion We showed that 15-amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus of NFATx1 ( DITLDDVNEIIGRDM ) were essential for supporting the transactivation function of NFATx1 ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) and confirmed that these amino acids comprise a transcriptional activation sequence ( Fig .
24 ) .
Furthermore , amino acid substitution proves that this sequence constitutes a motif required for activation ( Fig .
2B ) .
Interestingly , activation mediated by this 15-amino acid sequence is lost when its hydrophobic residues ( leucine , valine , and isoleucine ) are nonconservatively replaced by alanine .
Consistently , those hydrophobic residues are perfectly conserved among NFAT family proteins ( see below ) .
The mechanism of the transactivation remains unknown , but this 15-amino acid transactivation sequence increases the transactivation function of NFATx1 by enhancing its ability to interact with coactivator or other components of the general transcription apparatus , and alanine substitution of this sequence may cause disruption of this interaction .
The transcription-activating domains of other transcription factors have often been classified according to the predominant amino acids contained therein .
For example , acidic domain , glutamine-rich , and proline-rich ( 26 ) as well as glycine-rich ( 27 ) or isoleucine-rich ( 28 ) activating segments have been identi-fied .
Notably , the 15-amino acid transactivation sequence in NFATx1 does not contain typical amino acid residues for transactivation domains , except for the five acidic amino acids ( glu-tamic and aspartic ) .
Although some transcription-activating domains can be induced to fold into a-helixes ( 26 ) , it appears the transactivation sequence in NFATx1 does not allow a helix/coil structure as predicted by the algorithm AGADIR ( 29 ) .
We also have isolated the cDNAs encoding three isoforms of NFATx that have different carboxyl-terminal ends in this study ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
As a result , the transactivation sequence of NFATx1 is replaced for these isoforms .
Consistently , transactivation activity mediated by NFATx isoforms NFATx2 , NFATx3 , and NFATx4 was lower than that for NFATx1 in Jurkat as well as 293 cells ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
We also showed that the different carboxyl-terminal ends did not affect DNA binding ( Fig .
5C ) .
In fact , the NFATx isoforms were shown to have relatively similar binding affinities to the NFAT site using a competition experiment with increasing amounts of unlabeled probe in the EMSA ( data not shown ) .
These data indicated the importance of the transactivation sequence of NFATx1 in Jurkat and 293 cells and also suggested that NFAT ' x has a transactivation sequence as a module , and this sequence is replaced by a different sequence for a different isoform .
It is known that truncation of the activation domain of several transcription factors , such as STAT , retinoic acid receptor , and hepatocyte nuclear factor , turn them into dominant negative re-pressors of the normal forms ( 30-32 ) .
However , a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant of NFATx1 ( NFATx1AC ) and newly isolated NFATx isoforms ( NFATx2 , NFATx3 , and NFATx4 ) that showed lower transactivation activity than that of NFATx1 ( Figs .

Independently , Hoey et al .
previously reported the sequences of three isoforms of NFATx/NFAT4 , designated NFAT4a , NFAT4b , and NFAT4c ( 9 ) .
Sequence comparison between isoforms of NFAT4 and NFATx showed that NFATx2 , which we isolated in this study , was identical with NFAT4c .
Taken together , NFATx/ NFAT4 has at least six isoforms , named NFATx1 , NFATx2 ( NFATA4c ) , NFATx3 , NFATx4 , NFAT4a , and NFAT4b .
Unlike NFATx isoforms , the divergence of the sequences of NFAT4a and NFAT 4b isoforms begins just downstream of the Rel similarity region , where the carboxyl-terminal regions are much shorter ( 9 and 40 amino acid residues for Figure 4 , A and B , respectively ) .
Recently , we also cloned mouse counterparts of NFATx1 and NFATx2 , designated mNFATx1 and mNFATx2 , from a murine EL-4 cDNA library ( 33 ) .
Moreover , a truncated version of the mouse counterpart of human NFATx1 , designated NFATc3 , was also isolated from a cDNA library derived from the thymus of a TCR transgenic mouse by Ho et al .
( 13 ) .
The existence of isoforms has been reported for NFATI ( NE ATp ) .
Three isoforms of NFATI ( NFATp ) ( NFAT1-A , NFAT1-B , and NFAT1-C ) were isolated from a Jurkat cDNA library ( 34 , 35 ) .
As with NFATx isoforms , the very ends of the carboxyl-terminal region of NFATI ( NFATp ) isoforms are replaced by unrelated amino acid residues .
Similarly , an NFATe isoform with a distinctive sequence of the carboxyl-terminal region , designated NFATc.B , was recently reported ( 36 ) .
It appears , then , that the existence of multiple isoforms is a characteristic of NFAT proteins ( Table D ) .
We previously reported Northern blot analysis data showing that NFATx was expressed predominantly in thymus and at lower levels in peripheral blood leukocytes .
In that analysis , we used as a probe Bgill cDNA fragment ( positions 2698-3235 ) that contained a common sequence of all NFAT isoforms and an NFATx1-spe-cific sequence ( 10 ) .
In the present study we used a different cDNA probe ( positions 1156-2614 ) whose sequence was common in all four NFATx isoforms ( Fig .
44 ) .
Using this probe , we detected significant NFATx expression in various tissues , such as testis , ovary , skeletal muscle , and kidney as well as in thymus and leukocytes .
These observations prompted us to examine the possibility of differential expression of the NFATx mRNA isoforms .
Interestingly , RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses with probes 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3462 TRANSACTIVATION SEQUENCE OF NFATx1 NFATxi M [ ] FIGURE 6 .

Joints for NFATx isoforms and NFATI ( NFATp ) isoforms are indicated by the black bar .
*e [ n+l ok NFAT1-C 886 EVLPAGVTIKQEQNLDOTYLD NFAT3 specific for either NFATx1 or NFATx2 showed a significant difference in the ratio of the two NFAT ' x mRNA isoforms in different tissues .
Although our RT-PCR analysis showed the existence of NFATx3 and NFATx4 mRNA species in several tissues with distinct expression patterns ( Fig .
4B ) , we could not detect those mRNA species by Northern blot analysis using multiple tissue blot , suggesting that NFATx3 and NFATx4 isoforms are relatively minor species compared with NFATx1 and NFATx2 isoforms in those tissues .
On the other hand , NFATx1 and NFATx2 are major mRNA species , at least in thymus , leukocytes , and skeletal muscle tissues .
The thymus and leukocytes expressed primarily NFATx1 mRNA , while skeletal muscle expressed predominantly NFATx2 mRNA ( Fig .
4 , C and D ) .
Accordingly , the cDNA of NFAT4c , which is identical with that of NFATx2 , was cloned from a skeletal muscle tissue cDNA library ( 9 ) .
Although our RT-PCR analysis showed that NFATx1 mRNA was present ( Fig .
4C , lane 12 ) , it is notable that the Bg/lI cDNA fragment from NFATx1 did not strongly hybridize with mRNA from kidney .
It is thus possible that another NFAT ' x isoform is expressed in kidney .
Since the tissues in which we detected expression of NFATx mRNA isoforms , such as thymus , skeletal muscle , and kidney , consist of various types of cells , it is important to identify what types of cells in tissues express those isoforms to investigate their function .
In addition , we can not completely rule out the possibilities that expression of NFAT genes are under translational control and that NFAT proteins are not necessarily found in all tissues in which the genes are transcribed .
The use of isoform-specific Abs should help us resolve these issues .
The role of NFAT proteins in skeletal muscle and kidney tissues is unknown .
One potential target for NFAT proteins in these tissues could be the IL-15 gene , whose mRNA expression was observed outside the lymphoid system ; in particular , skeletal muscle , kidney , placenta , and lung expressed IL-15 mRNA strongly , whereas lymphoid organs , such as spleen and thymus , expressed lesser quantities of the transcript ( 37 , 38 ) .
Alternatively , it is also possible that target genes of NFAT proteins are other than cytokine genes .
Interestingly , recent gene targeting and a transgene approach suggest that NFAT family proteins have unique target genes other than cytokine genes in heart ( 39-41 ) .
No obvious abnormality was reported in the skeletal muscle and kidney of mice deficient in NFAT1 ( NFATp ) or NFATc protein ( 39 , 40 , 42 ) .
The development of mice deficient in other NFAT proteins ( NFATx and NFAT3 ) will help us understand the roles of the NFAT family proteins in these tissues .
Significantly , the transactivation sequence of NFATx1 that we identified in this study was also found in NFAT1-C , one of the NFATI ( NFATp ) isoforms , and in NFAT3 ( Fig .
6 ) .

Imamura , E. S. Masuda , and N. Arai , unpublished observation ) .
Consistently , Luo et al .
showed that NFAT1-C was the most potent transcriptional activa-tor among NFATI ( NFATp ) ( 35 ) .
In addition , they showed that a GALA DNA binding domain fused to the carboxyl-terminal domain of NFAT1-C contained intrinsic transactivation potential .
In summary , we identified a novel category of transactivation sequence in the carboxyl-terminal region of NFATx1 , a major transactivation domain of NFATx , carrying a 15-amino acid sequence that gives potent transactivation function .
We also isolated novel mRNA isoforms of human NFAT ' x ( NFATx2 , -x3 , and -x4 ) that show distinct tissue distribution patterns ; ie. , expression of NFATx 1 is preferentially in T cells , and that of NFATx2 is high in skeletal muscle tissue .
Among these isoforms , only NFATx1 , which carries the complete 15-amino acid transactivation sequence , shows higher transactivation activity in T cells .
The sequence seems to be conserved in other NFAT family members and may explain the tissue-specific transactivation function of NFAT family proteins .
Thus , this observation may be useful for developing reagents that block NFAT activity in specific tissues .
