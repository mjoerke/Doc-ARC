Expression of p13~ '' '' '' '' Is Restricted To Mature T-Cell Proliferations With t ( X ; 14 ) Translocations By Ali Madani , Valérie Choukroun , Jean Soutier , Valére Cacheux , Jean-Frangois Claisse , Frangoise Valensi , Sylvie Daliphard , Bruno Cazin , Vincent Levy , Véronique Leblond , Marie-Thérése Daniel , Frangois Sigaux , and Marc-Henri Stern T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL } , a rare form of mature T-cell leukemias , and ataxia telangiectasia clonal prolif-eration , a related condition occurring in patients suffering from ataxia telangiectasia , have been associated to translocations involving the 14q32.1 or Xq28 regions , where are located the TCL1 and MTCP1 putative oncogenes , respec-tively .
The MTCP1 gene is involved in the t ( X ; 14 ) ( q28 ; q11 ) translocation associated with these T-cell proliferations .
Alternative splicing generates type A and B transcripts that potentially encode two entirely distinct proteins : type A transcripts code for a small mitochondrial protein , p8 '' '' '' '' '' , and type B transcripts , containing an additional open reading frame , may code for a 107 amino-acid protein , p13 '' .
The recently cloned TCLT gene , also involved in translocations and inversions associated with T-cell proliferations , -CELL PROLYMPHOCYTIC leukemia ( T-PLL ) is a rare form of mature T-cell proliferations that has been associated with translocations involving the 14q32.1 re-gion '' and to a lesser extent the Xq28 region . '' ''
A preinva-sive stage of T-PLL , named Ataxia Telangiectasia Clonal Proliferation ( ATCP ) , has been described in the cancer-prone genetic disease ataxia telangiectasia . '' '' '
The presence of identical translocations in ATCPs and in T-PLLs supports the view that these translocations play a role in the early stages of the disease .
On this basis , the MTCPI gene was identified by its involvement in the t ( X ; 14 ) ( q28 ; q11 ) trans-location . '' ''
So far , the five t ( X ; 14 ) breakpoints cloned occurred 5 ' to or within the MTCPI gene . ''
The MTCPI gene encodes for several mRNAs generated by alternative splicing .
The 1.0- to 1.2-kb type A transcripts code for an unusually small protein of 8 kD ( p8* '' '' '' '' ) '' '' that is located in the mitochondria . ''
Type A transcripts'* '' * and p8* '' C '' '' '' are highly expressed in T-cell proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) .
However , we have described another splicing type of MTCPI1 transcripts ( type B1 ) , composed of four additional exons , that contains an additional 321 nt open reading frame potentially coding for an entirely different protein of 13 kD ( p13* '' '' '' ) . ''
Using Northern blot analysis , this class of mRNAs was found at minute levels in tissues analyzed so far . }
The recent cloning of TCLI , the candidate 14q32.1 onco-gene , showed at the protein level an unquestionable homology with p13 . ''
Both TCLI and MTCP1 gene products do not share homology with other known sequences and thus constitute a new gene family .
Rearrangements in the vicinity of these genes observed in T-PLLs and related T-cell proliferations strongly advocate for their roles in the pathogenesis of T-PLL .
This homology between pi and the putative pl protein led us to analyze expression in T-PLLs .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
Cell lines used : Cos-7 is a monkey SV40 transformed kidney cell line ; RH and 90-109 are lymphoblastoid cell lines derived 4TCLI 3MTCPI Blood , Vol 87 , No 5 ( March 1 ) , 1996 : pp 1923-1927 codes for a 14-kD protein that displays significant homology with p13 '' '' '' ° '' '' , We have generated rabbit antisera against this putative p13~ '' '' '' ' protein and screened for expression of p13 '' normal lymphoid tissues and 33 cases of immature and mature lymphoid T-cell proliferations , using a sensitive Western blot assay .
We also investigated the MTCP1 locus configuration by Southern blot analysis .
The p13 '' protein was detected in the three T-cell proliferations with MTCP1 rearrangements because of t ( X ; 14 ) translocations , but neither in normal resting and activated lymphocytes nor in the other T-cell leukemias .
Our data support the hypothesis that p13 '' and p14 '' '' '' form a new protein family that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of T-PLL and related conditions .

1924 was verified , and Escherichia coli JM109 cells containing the recombinant plasmid were grown in Superbroth medium . ''
After a 4-hour induction by IPTG ( 0.1 mmol/L ) , the GST-p13* '' * '' '' fusion protein was extracted and purified by Glutathione-agarose chromatography as described . '' '
New Zealand white female rabbits were immunized with the purified GST-p13~ '' '' '' emulsified with Freund 's adjuvant .
After three boosts , the antiserum was used without further purifica-tion .
Obtention of the anti-p8 '' '' '' '' antiserum was previously re-ported . ''
Western blotting .
Cell proteins were extracted with the Triple Detergent Lysis Buffer , '' quantified using the BCA kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , size fractionated on 10 % Tris-tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels ( SDS-PAGE ) , '' and electrotransferred on nitrocellulose .
The membrane was blocked overnight in 10 % nonfat dry milk in PBST ( phosphate-buffered saline ; Tween 20 , 0.1 % ) .
The antiserum was diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer and applied to the membrane .
After 1 hour of incubation , the membrane was washed with PBST and incubated with goat-antirabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate ( Boehringer Mannheim , France ) for 1 hour .
After three washes in PBST , the membrane was overlayed with the chemiluminescent substrate solution and developed according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( ECL , Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Transient transfections .
- The orf 107 sequence was cloned in the BamHI site of the eukaryote expression vector pSGS ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
The recombinant plasmid was transfected into the Cos-7 cell line by the calcium-phosphate method . ''
Cells were tryp-sinized after 36 hours and analyzed by Western blotting after protein extraction .
DNA analysis .
- High molecular weight DNA was extracted from leukemic samples , digested by BamHI and Sac I restriction enzymes and the resulting fragments were separated according to size by electrophoresis through a 0.8 % agarose gel .
After alkaline transfer on N*Hybond membranes ( Amersham ) , samples were hybridized to P radiolabeled probes . `` ?
Probes used are schematized see Fig 2A ; probes 2.5RB and 1.0XH were used on T-PLL DNAs allowing an analysis of approximately 50 kb 5 ' to and within the MTCP/ gene ; probe 4.5RB was also used to analyze patient Lec .
cDNA cloning and sequencing .
_ A cDNA library from the murine T-cell lymphoma cell line EL4 ( Stratagene ) was screened with a human MTCP/ cDNA probe .
Positive clones were in vivo excised according to the protocols of the manufacturer and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
MADANI ET AL RESULTS Expression analysis of the MTCPI products .
- Considering that the homology between and MTCPI was restricted to the p13* '' '' * '' '' product , we analyzed the expression of p13 '' '' '' '' in T-PLLs .
Rabbit antibodies against p13 '' '' '' '' were generated and a sensitive Western blot assay was designed .
The specificity of the antibody was controlled in transiently transfected Cos-7 cells in which a strong 13-kD signal was detected , corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the product of B1 transcripts .
No 13-kD signal was detected in 90-109 and RH cell lines derived from hemophilic patients with a Xq28 deletion including the MTCPI gene '' ( Fig 1 ) .
We then analyzed normal and leukemic T-cell samples .
Normal PBLs were found negative for p13* '' * '' '' expression ( Fig 1 ) as were phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -activated lymphocytes and normal B lymphocytes ( data not shown ) .
A series of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias ( 9 cases ) , HTLV-I positive acute T-cell leukemia/lymphomas ( 4 cases ) , Sezary syndromes ( 4 cases ) and large granular lymphocyte proliferations ( 4 cases ) was also found negative for p13 '' expression ( data not shown ) .
Two previously described T-cell proliferations with known t ( X ; 14 ) translocations ( Dol and Civ ) '' and a series of 10 T-PLLs obtained from different French hematologic centers were then analyzed .
Diagnosis was confirmed by reviewing blood or BM smears using FAB criteria '' and medical records .
A weak but unquestionable signal of 13 kD was found in Civ and Dol , the two patients with a known t ( X : 14 ) .
Among the 10 other T-PLLs analyzed , only one patient , Lec , expressed the p13* '' * '' '' protein ( Fig 1 ) .
The expression of the product of type A transcripts of the MTCP1 gene , p8 '' '' '' '' , was also studied in these samples .
Contrary to what was observed for p13 '' '' * '' '' expression , p8* '' '' was expressed in all patients and in normal PBL s. As previously reported , '' higher expression of p8 '' '' * '' '' was found in the proliferations of Dol and Civ with known t ( X ; 14 ) s. The p8 '' '' '' '' protein was also expressed at high levels in patient Lee and , to a lesser extent , in patient Lep ( Fig 1 ) .

Southern blot analysis of the MTCPI locus .
- The MTCPI gene was studied by standard Southern blot techniques using two probes and two restriction digests , allowing the analysis of approximately 50 kb 5 to and within MTCPZ .
T-PLL DNAs were found in germline configuration for the MTCP I locus with the exception of the previously reported Dol and Civ rearrangements and of the Lec rearrangement .
A germline 14-kb fragment and an abnormal 16-kb fragment were observed using the 1.0XH probe in patient Lec 's BamHI digested DNA ( Fig 2B ) .
The same blot was then probed using the 4.5RB probe , located 3 '' to MTCPI exon 1 and hybridizing to the same germline 14 kb BamHI fragment ( see Fig 2A for schematic representation of the MTCP ] locus and localization of the probes used ) .
An abnormal 12 kb fragment was found in patient Lec 's BamHI digested DNA .
The Southern blot data were thus compatible with a translo- 1925 cation event in patient Lec occurring between the two fragments used as probes .
A karyotype obtained from a frozen sample of Lee 's leukemic cells confirmed this hypothesis by showing the presence of a t ( X ; 14 ) .
Comparison of human and murine MTCPI and human TCLI1 protein sequences .
A murine T-cell lymphoma cell line cDNA library was hybridized to a human MTCP7 cDNA probe and one cross-hybridizing type B murine cDNA clone was selected and sequenced .
Comparison of murine and human sequences of the open reading frame coding for p13 '' © '' '' showed a very high level of conservation at the nucleotidic level ( 92 % of identity , data not shown ) and at the deduced amino-acid level ( 95 % of identity ) ( Fig 3 ) .
Comparison of sequences with the p14 '' sequence showed a much lower degree of homology ( p13 '' '' '' '' v p14 '' , 39 % of identity ) ( Fig 3 ) .
DISCUSSION Based on the results of our Western blot assay , the analysis of the p13 '' '' * '' '' protein in normal and malignant T cells showed a restricted expression in T-cell proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) .
The p13 '' '' '' '' protein was not expressed in resting or activated normal lymphocytes and in other leukemic samples .
This protein is homologous to the TCL/ gene product , p14 '' , which is expressed in T-cell proliferations with 14q32.1 translocations .
' '' '' ** '' The specific expression of p13 '' in proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) and its homology with p14 '' also involved in T-PLLs or related T-cell proliferations strongly suggest a role of p13 '' in leukemogene-sis .
The p13 '' * '' '' /p14 '' ** '' protein family shares no homology with other oncoproteins , and biochemical and cellular analyses in transfected cells and in transgenic animals will be necessary to determine in which oncogenic mechanism they are involved .
However , because p14 '' ** '' expression is restricted in the T-cell lineage to immature thymocytes and activated peripheral lymphocytes , we can hypothesize that the overexpression may interfere with T-cell activation and/or differentiation .
It can also be drawn from studies in ataxia telangiectasia patients that TCLI and MTCP1 gene rearrangements occur at an early stage of leu-kemogenesis and are not per se sufficient for the development of malignancy , '' hypothesis conforted by the demonstration in preleukemic T-cell proliferations of the overexpression of ( this report ) or p14 '' .
Chromosomal translocations involving the Xq28 region have been so far rarely reported in malignancy . ''

1926 the ataxia telangiectasia clonal T-cell proliferation ' '' Dol '' selected for its chromosomal aberration , '' we have screened for MTCP1 rearrangement a series of 11 T-PLLs collected without knowledge of the cytogenetic data .
This approach allowed us to detect two additional t ( X ; 14 ) in the T-PLLs ' '' and ' '' Lec '' ( this report ) .
Considering the way we have recruited T-PLLs in our series , a bias in selecting proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) is unlikely .
The rarity of reported t ( X ; 14 ) cases in the literature '' probably reflects the rarity of the T-cell prolymphocytic type of leukemia .
The t ( X ; 14 ) translocation , occurring in a significant proportion of T-PLLs and related proliferations , should be considered as a marker of these diseases .
Initial hypotheses on the role of MTCP/ in leukemogene-sis were misled by the fact , so far unprecedented for a mammalian gene , that this gene codes for two differents proteins .
Northern blot analyses from us and others '' '' previously detected only significant levels of type A transcripts in proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) .
The MTCPI product coded by these transcripts , the mitochondrial protein p8* '' '' '' '' '' , was found overexpressed in these proliferations . ''
The possible relevance in oncogenesis of was thus initially underestimated because type BI transcripts have been undetected in proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) by Northern blot assay using total RNAs , but nevertheless were coding for low but detectable levels of p13 '' .
An alternative splicing mechanism contributes to generate the different coding capabilities of MTCP !
transcripts . ''
The invertly related levels of p13 '' '' * '' '' and p8 '' '' '' '' '' proteins in our small series of proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) are compatible with a splicing regulation but could also be related to the localization of the different Xq28 breakpoints .
The mechanism by which a high expression of p8 '' '' '' '' exists in some T-PLLs without t ( X ; 14 ) , especially in the T-PLL ' '' Lep , . ''
when compared to normal lymphocytes ( Fig 1 ) has also to be clarified .
Data on transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations of MTCPI are clearly needed to answer these questions .
Because the mitochondrial protein p is overexpressed in T-cell proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) and because its biologic function is still unknown , we can not rule out its participation in oncogenesis .
However , the specific expression of p13* '' '' '' in proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) and the homology of this protein with p14 '' represent strong evidences for a key role of the p13* '' '' '' '/p14 '' * '' protein family in the pathogenesis of T-PLL and related diseases .
Moreover , the biologic importance of p13 '' '' '' '' is reflected by its high degree of conservation in mammals .
