5 Expression of NFAT-Family Proteins in Normal Human T Cells LYUDMILA LYAKH , * PARITOSH GHOSH , *¢ anp NANCY R. RICE'* Molecular Biology of Retroviruses Section , Molecular Basis of Carcinogenesis Laboratory , ABL-Basic Research Program , '' and Laboratory of Experimental Immunology , Division of Basic Science , SAIC , '' NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , Maryland 21702-1201 Received 25 July 1996/Returned for modification 27 September 1996/Accepted 12 December 1996 NFAT proteins constitute a family of transcription factors involved in mediating signal transduction .
Using a panel of specific antisera in immunoprecipitation assays , we found that NFATp ( 135 kDa ) is constitutively expressed in normal human T cells , while synthesis of NFATe ( predominant form of 86 kDa ) is induced by ionomycin treatment .
NFAT4/x was very weakly expressed in unstimulated cells , and its level did not increase upon treatment with activating agents .
NFAT3 protein was not observed under any conditions .
Higher-molecular-weight species of NFAT'¢ ( of 110 and 140 kDa ) were also detected .
In addition , translation of NFATe mRNA apparently initiates at two different AUG codons , giving rise to proteins that differ in size by 36 amino acids .
Additional size heterogeneity of both NFATc and NFAT p results from phosphorylation .
In contrast to ionomycin treatment , exposure of cells to phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) plus anti-CD28 did not induce NFATe , indicating that under these conditions , interleukin-2 synthesis by these cells is apparently independent of NFAT ' c .
In DNA binding assays , both PMA plus anti-CD28 and PMA plus ionomycin resulted in nuclear NFAT .
Surprisingly , the PMA-ionomycin-induced synthesis of NFATc that was detected by immunoprecipitation was not mirrored in the DNA binding assays : nearly all of the activity was due to NFATp .
This is the first study of expression of all family members at the protein level in normal human T cells .
NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) is implicated in regulation of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene transcription ( for reviews , see references 13 and 30 ) .
In addition , NFAT-binding sites have been identified in the regulatory regions of various other cytokine genes , including the IL-4 ( 3 , 33 , 38 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( 7 , 23 ) , and IL-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( 4 , 22 ) genes .
Though originally found in T cells , NFAT DNA-binding activity and/or protein has now been found in other cell types , including B cells ( 2 , 40 , 41 , 45 ) , mast cells ( 29 ) , natural killer ( NK ) cells ( 1 ) , and a neuronal cell line and certain regions of the brain ( 8 ) .
Thus , NFAT is likely to play an important role in the regulation of a variety of genes in a number of different cell types .
To date , cDNAs from four different NFAT genes ( NFATp , NFATc , NFAT3 , and NFATA/NFATx ) have been cloned , and they constitute a related but quite divergent family ( 9 , 11 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 26 , 27 ) .
The family in turn is weakly related to the Rel/NF- « B family of transcription factors over a 300-amino-acid region called the Rel homology domain ( RHD ) .
NFAT sequences in this region govern DNA binding and association with the AP-1 transcription factor ( 12 ) , and within the RHD , sequence conservation among the NFAT proteins is very high .
Upstream of the RHD , NFAT proteins are less closely related , but they do share several serine- and proline-rich segments .
Downstream of the RHD , NFAT proteins are variable in length and in sequence .
The hallmark of NFAT activity is its inducibility by agents that increase intracellular Ca** flux ( e.g. , ligands of the T-cell receptor or the calcium ionophore ionomycin ) ( for reviews , see references 5 and 35 ) .
The increased Ca** activates the Ca**/ calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin ( phosphatase * Corresponding author .

2475 2B ) , which directly or indirectly results in dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of preexisting cytoplasmic NFAT ( 16 , 17 , 36 ) .
Since the process involves calcineurin , activation of NFAT is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( 17 , 36 ) .
Until recently , NFAT was known primarily through DNA binding assays , but with molecular cloning of the genes , development of reagents capable of recognizing specific family members became possible .
It is now known that NFATp mRNA is expressed constitutively in many different cell types ( 11 , 21 , 42 ) , and preexisting NFAT p protein translocates to the nucleus upon stimulation of the cell ( 16 , 17 ) .
NFATe mRNA ( 26 ) is expressed less widely , and at least in some cell types ( e.g. , normal human NK cells and some Jurkat T-cell clones ) , it is not expressed unless cells are stimulated with immune complexes or with ionomycin and phorbol ester ( 1 , 21 , 26 ) .
Except for transient transfection studies , NFATc protein has not been described .
NFAT3 mRNA ( 11 ) was found at significant levels in several organs , but little or none was seen in spleen , thymus , or peripheral blood lymphocytes .
NFAT4 mRNA ( 9 , 11 , 21 ) is elevated in thymus , but is also detectable in various other organs .
In Jurkat cells , it is expressed constitutively ( 21 ) .
Neither NFAT3 nor NFAT4 protein has been described .
As a first step toward defining specific functions for the individual NFAT proteins , we have investigated the expression and DNA-binding properties of NFAT family members in both stimulated and unstimulated T cells .
Since tumor cell lines may differ in significant ways from normal nontrans-formed cells , we have focused our efforts on freshly isolated human peripheral blood T cells ( PBT 's ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell and tissue culture .
Freshly purified PBTs were greater than 95 % CD3* cells .
Human PBTs were purified according to standard procedures , including Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation , plastic adherence , nylon wool filtration , and Per-coll gradient centrifugation .
The Jurkat human T-cell line ( clone LEI ) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , penicillin , and streptomycin .
Phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; Sigma ) was used at 5 to 10 ng/ml for PBTs and 20 ng/ml for Jurkat cells ; ionomycin ( Boehringer 2476 LYAKH ET AL .
Mannheim Biochemicals ) was used at 0.25 to 1 pg/ml for PBTs and 2 pl/ml for Jurkat cells ; purified anti-human CD28 antibody ( anti-CD28 ; Pharmingen ) was used at 100 to 500 ng/ml and CsA ( Sandoz ) at 500 ng/ml .
Cells were preincubated with CsA for 1 to 1.5 h before addition of PMA and ionomycin .
Antisera .
Rabbit antisera were raised against the following synthetic peptides : for NFATe , 801 ( NH , -CVSPKTTDPEEGFPRGLGA [ residues 210 to 227 of human NFATe ] ) ( 26 ) , 904 ( NH , -KSAEEEHYGYASSNVC [ residues 38 to 52 of human NFATc ] ) , 905 ( NH , -PSTSFPVPSKFPLC [ residues 2 to 14 of human NFATe ] ) , and 906 ( NH , -CVALKVEPVGEDLGSPP [ residues 346 to 361 of human NFATc ] ) ; for NFATp , 1777 ( NH , -CSPPSGPAYPDDVLDYGLK [ residues 53 to 70 of human NFATp ] ) ( 18 ) and 1616 ( NH , -VPAIKT EPSDEYEPSLIC [ residues 680 to 696 of murine NFATp ; in human NFATp , the underlined serines are threonines , and the underlined glutamic acid is aspartic acid [ 18 ] ; a sequence similar to that of peptide 1616 is also found in the form of NFATe recently described by Park et al .
[ 27 ] , and it is therefore possible that antiserum 1616 cross-reacts with this longer form of NFATe ] ) ; for NFAT3 , 890 ( NH , -CDSKVVFIERGPDGKLQWEE [ residues 614 to 632 of human NFAT3 ] ) ( 11 ) and 889 ( NH , -GRDLSGFPAPPGEEPPA [ residues 886 to 902 of human NFAT3 ] ) ; for NFAT4 , 1689 ( NH , -DLQINDPEREFLERPSRDHL [ residues 130 to 149 of human NFAT4 ] ) ( 21 ) ; for NFATx , 1690 ( NH , -CLPSPESLDLG RSDGL [ residues 1061 to 1075 of human NFAT ] ) ( 21 ) ; and for all NFATs , 796 ( NH , -SDIELRKGETDIGRKNTRC [ residues 542 to 559 of human NFATc ] ) ( 26 ) .
Except for 889 and 1689 , a cysteine residue was added at the N or C terminus of each peptide to facilitate coupling to hemocyanin as described previously ( 15 ) .
Monoclonal antibody 7A6 , raised against recombinant NFAT , was a gift of G. Crabtree .
NF- « B antisera 1226 ( anti-p65 ) and 1141 ( anti-p50 ) have been described previously ( 32 ) .
Plasmids .
Full-length human NFATe in plasmid pBJ5 ( p1SH107 , , ) was a gift of G. Crabtree .
The insert was excised with BamHI and cloned into pRe/CMV ( Invitrogen ) .
Human NFATp , NFAT3 , and NFAT42 , each in pRep4 , were gifts of T. Hoey .
Transfection .
Human 293 cells were seeded at 10 % /6-cm-diameter dish .
Twen-ty-four hours later , they were transfected with NFAT expression vectors by the calcium phosphate method .
Oligonucleotides .
Oligonucleotides were synthesized by an Applied Biosys-tems synthesizer and used in DNA binding assays without purification .
For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , we used oligonucleotides containing the murine IL-4 NFAT site ( 5'-ATAAAATTTITCCAATGTAAA-3 ' ) , the murine IL-2 distal NFAT site ( 5'-GCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATAC A-3 ' ) , and the human IL-2 distal NFAT site ( 5'-TAAGGAGGAAAAACTGT TTCATACA-3 ' ) .
Complementary strands were renatured and labeled with as previously described ( 31 ) .
Metabolic labeling .
PBTs ( 5 X 10 % /ml ) or Jurkat cells ( 10 % /m1 ) were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium ( Sigma ) containing 2 % dialyzed fetal calf serum ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , ionomycin , PMA , CsA , anti-CD28 , or no activating agent for 1.5 to 3 h. The cells were then resuspended in a fresh aliquot of the same medium containing 5 % dialyzed fetal calf serum and incubated in the presence of [ *°SJmethionine and [ *°SJcysteine ( each at 100 .Ci/m ! )
with or without activating agent ( s ) at 37°C for 1.5 to 2 h ( PBTs ) or 45 min ( Jurkat cells ) .
At 24 h after transfection , 293 cells were labeled for 1 h in the presence of [ **Smethionine and [ *°SJcysteine ( each at 100 wCi/m1 } .
Immunoprecipitations .
To reduce nonspecific background , immunoprecipitations of lysates from PBTs and Jurkat cells were performed in two cycles .
Whole-cell extracts were precipitated ( with or without prior boiling ) , and precipitates were washed , boiled , and reprecipitated .
Two different lysis buffers were used .
The first , referred to as ELB , consists of 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.0 ) , 250 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , and 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 .
PBTs ( 50 x 10° ) were lysed in 0.3 to 1 ml of ELB , and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 15 min .
Lysis buffer also contained phosphatase inhibitors ( 1 mM sodium vanadate and 0.1 pg of calyculin A [ Bochringer Mannheim Biochemi-cals ] per ml ) and protease inhibitors ( 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 ug of aprotinin [ Sigma ] per ml , 5 ug of leupeptin per ml , and 5 ug of pepstatin per ml ) or protease inhibitor cocktail ( Bochringer Mannheim Biochemicals ) diluted 1:50 .
A different lysis procedure was used for Jurkat cells and in some PBT experiments .
Cells were lysed in ELB buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors plus 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 1 % B-mercaptocthanol , and 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate ( ELB-SDS ) .
Lysates were boiled , passed through a 22-gauge needle to shear the DNA , and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 15 min .
Regardless of lysis procedure , extracts were incubated overnight with antiserum and protein A-Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) after dilution with TNT buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X-100 ) .
Precipitates were washed three times with TNT buffer , boiled for 5 min in TNT containing 1 % SDS , and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 3 min .
The supernatants were collected , diluted at least fivefold with TNT buffer , and reprecipitated with a fresh aliquot of the same antiserum .
The second cycle precipitates were washed and analyzed by 10 % Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( Novex ) .
Transfected 293 cells were lysed in ELB containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors .
After boiling in the presence of 1 % SDS , lysates were diluted with TNT buffer , and aliquots ( 1 to 3 % of the total ) were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .

NFAT antisera .
The RHDs of the NFAT proteins are aligned .
Boxes represent peptides against which antisera were raised .
Peptide 796 is found in all four proteins .
The solid line for NFATe represents one of the two splicing variants that have been described ( 26 ) .
The second NFATc variant is identical except for an additional 142 residues at the C terminus ( denoted by the dashed line ) and the replacement of residues 1 to 29 at the N terminus ( 27 ) .
Thus , peptide 905 is found in the first variant but not the second .
Several 3 ' splicing variants of NFATp have been found ( 18 , 24 ) .
Two of them ( denoted by the solid line ) are very similar in size and differ only at their extreme C termini .
The third is considerably longer ( denoted by the dashed line ) .
Several 3 ' splice variants of NFAT4 , called NFAT42 , -4b , and -4c by Hoey et al .
( 11 ) and NFAT by Masuda et al .
( 21 ) , have also been described .
NFAT4a and -4b have shorter C-terminal regions than NFATx .
NFATA4c is identical to NFATx except at the extreme C terminus .
Peptide 1689 is found in all forms , but peptide 1690 is unique to NFAT .
Preparation of cellular extracts and EMSA .
For nuclear and cytoplasmic cell fractions , PBTs ( 25 X 10° to 125 X 10° cells ) were rinsed in ice-cold hypotonic buffer ( HB ; 25 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.6 ] , 1 mM MgCl , , 5 mM KCI ) and lysed in 0.2 to 1 ml of HB containing 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 .
After vortexing , the lysate was centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min ; the supernatant constitutes the cytoplasmic fraction .
After being washed once in 0.5 to 2.5 ml of HB , the pelleted nuclei were extracted with 30 to 150 pl of a solution containing 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , and 0.065 % Nonidet P-40 at 4°C for 30 min with agitation .
The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C ; the supernatant constitutes the nuclear extract .
Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay , with bovine serum albumin for standardization .
For EMSA , the binding reaction mixture was 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) , 80 mM KCI , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 6 % glycerol , 0.5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , 0.5 pg of sonicated double-stranded salmon sperm DNA , *°P-labeled oligonucleotide ( 1 ng ; ~0.5 X 10° to 3 X 10° cpm ) , and cellular lysate ( 0.5 to 5 g ) in a total volume of 20 pl .
The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min .
For supershift analysis , the reaction mixture minus *°P-labeled DNA was preincubated with 1 pl of antiserum for 20 min on ice before addition of the *°P-labeled DNA .
Products were analyzed on 6 % DNA retardation gels ( Novex ) .
In vitro phosphatase treatment .
Second-cycle °S-labeled immunoprecipitates were washed three times with TNT buffer , resuspended in dephosphorylation buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 8.5 ] , 0.1 mM EDTA ) with 20 U of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals ) , and incubated at 37°C for 60 min .
After addition of gel-loading buffer , samples were boiled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Novex ) .
Human 293 cells expressing transfected NFATe were lysed in ELB buffer containing 1 % SDS and 0.5 % B-mercaptocethanol .
Lysates were boiled , diluted fivefold , and immunoprecipitated with anti-NFATc 801 .
Immunoprecipitates were washed and treated with alkaline phosphatase as described above .
They were then washed in 50 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.0 ) and incubated with 2 pg of calcineurin ( Upstate Biotechnology , Inc. ) at 37°C for 45 min according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
After a final wash , immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and subjected to immu-noblot analysis .
Immunoblotting .
Immunoblots were incubated with anti-NFATc serum 801 diluted 1:1,000 , and proteins were revealed with the Amersham ECL system .
RESULTS NFAT antisera .
To be able to distinguish the various NFAT family members , we raised antisera directed against synthetic peptides unique to each protein ( Fig .

In addition , we raised an antiserum against a highly conserved peptide found in the Vor .

Characterization of NFAT antisera .
Human 293 cells were transfected with NFATp ( A ) , NFAT3 ( B ) , NFAT4a ( C ) , or NFATce ( D ) , and the cells were radioactively labeled 24 h later .
( A to D ) Lysates were precipitated with the indicated antisera ( « NFAT abs ) , and precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
( E ) Supernatants were collected from samples 1 to 6 shown in panel D and were reprecipitated ( Re-IP ) with serum 906 .
Antiserum 796 is expected to recognize all NFAT family members and is designated 796 ( pan ) .
Antisera 1616 ( p ) and 1777 ( p ) are directed at NFATp .
Antisera 889 ( 3 ) and 890 ( 3 ) are directed at NFAT3 .
Antiserum 1689 ( 4 ) is directed at all forms of NFAT4 , while antiserum 1690 ( x ) should recognize only NFATx .
Antisera 801 ( c ) , 904 ( c ) , 905 ( c ) , and 906 ( c ) are directed at NFATc .
An asterisk indicates that the precipitation was carried out in the presence of cognate peptide .
Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons .
RHD .
This antiserum , 796 , recognizes all of the known family members .
Using lysates from human 293 cells transiently transfected with NFATc , NFATp , NFAT3 , or NFAT4a , we tested each serum for the ability to immunoprecipitate its target protein in a specific manner ( Fig .
2 ) .
As expected , antiserum 796 recognized all four NFAT family members ( Fig .
2A to C , lanes 5 ; Fig .
2D , lane 1 ) .
This binding was specific , since it was prevented when precipitation was carried out in the presence of peptide 796 ( Fig .
2B , lane 8 ) .
NFATp was precipitated by both NFATp antisera but not by sera directed at NFATc , NFAT3 , or NFAT4 ( Fig .
2A ) .
Similarly , NFAT3 was recognized by both NFAT3 sera but not by antisera raised against NFATp or NFATe ( Fig .
2B ) .
NFAT4a was precipitated by serum 1689 , which is expected to recognize all forms of NFAT4 , but not by serum 1690 , which is specific for the longest form , called NFAT ' x ( Fig .
2C , lanes 6 and 8 ) .
Neither NFATp-nor NFAT ' c antisera precipitated NFAT4a ( Fig .
2C , lanes 1 to 4 ) .
Finally , all NFAT antisera precipitated NFATec , but NFATp- and NFAT ' x sera did not ( Fig .
2D ) .
In addition , recognition of each transfected protein was specific since it was prevented when precipitation was carried out in the presence of cognate peptide ( Fig .
2A , lane 7 ; Fig .
2C , lane 7 ; Fig .
2D , lane 6 ) .
Thus , all of the sera specifically recognize their expected targets and do not cross-react with other family members .
We also tested the efficiency with which each antiserum precipitated its target .
To do this , supernatants were collected following the immunoprecipitations shown in Fig .
2A to D and reprecipitated with one of the NFATp sera ( for samples shown in Fig .
2A ) , with one of the NFAT3 sera ( for samples shown in Fig .
2B ) , with anti-NFAT4a serum 1689 ( for samples shown in Fig .
2C ) , and with one of the NFATc sera ( for samples shown in Fig .
2D ) .
In all cases , we found very little NFAT protein in the supernatants .
An example of the results is shown in Fig .
2E .
In four of the five samples , there was little or no NFATc left in the supernatants following the initial precipitation by either the pan-NFAT serum 796 or the NFATc antisera ( Fig .
26 , lanes 1 to 3 and 5 ) .
The only exception was the supernatant following precipitation with anti-NFATe serum 905 .
In this case , substantial NFATc remained and was precipitated in the second step ( lane 4 ) .
This result was expected , however , since antiserum 905 recognizes only a specific small fraction of all NFATc molecules ( see below ) .
Also as expected , NFATe was found in the supernatant when the first precipitation was carried out in the presence of competing peptide ( lane 6 ) .
Thus , the antisera are not only specific but also efficient .
NFAT proteins in Jurkat cells .
To test whether the antisera recognize their target proteins in T cells , we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with Jurkat cell lysates , since both NFATp and NFATc mRNAs have been detected in these cells ( 11 , 22 , 26 ) .
Jurkat cells were treated ( or not ) with PMA plus ionomycin ( P+1 ) for 3 h , radioactively labeled , and precipitated with sera raised against NFATp , NFAT4/x , or NFATc .
As in cells transfected with NFATp , anti-NFATp serum 1777 recognized a protein of about 135 kDa in both untreated and treated Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3 , lanes 4 and 10 ) .
NFAT4 antiserum 1689 , which should detect all forms of NFAT4 , and serum 1690 , which should detect only the form called NFAT ' x , both precipitated a protein of 155 kDa from untreated cells ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Since the intensities of the two bands are similar , and since the size of the protein is consistent with that predicted by NFAT ' x cDNA , we conclude that NFAT is the predominant form of NFAT4 expressed in these Jurkat cells .
The intensities of the NFATp and NFATx bands were somewhat less in treated cells ( lanes 10 and 11 ) than in untreated cells .
This may be a toxic effect of the treatment and/or may be a downregulation of synthesis .
NFATc antiserum 801 precipitated three proteins ( 140 , 110 , and 86 kDa ) from untreated cells ( lane 3 ) , 2478 LYAKH ET AL .

Immunoprecipitation of NFAT proteins from Jurkat cells .
Jurkat cells ( clone LEI ) were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium that contained P+1I or no activating agents ( Un ) for 2 h. They were resuspended in fresh aliquots of the same medium and incubated in the presence of [ S ) methionine and for 45 min .
Whole-cell lysates were boiled and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antiserum ( aNFAT ) .
Precipitates were washed , boiled , and reprecipitated with the same serum .
These second precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
An asterisk indicates that the precipitation was carried out in the presence of cognate peptide .
Mobilities of the proteins in lanes 2 to 7 can not be compared precisely with those in lanes 8 to 12 since the two sets were analyzed on different gels .
and expression of the 110- and 86-kDa forms was greatly enhanced in the P+I-treated cells ( lane 12 ) , consistent with previous reports of the inducibility of NFATe ( 22 , 26 ) .
The 86-kDa protein corresponds to the NFATe cDNA cloned by Northrop et al .
( 26 ) and is the same size as seen in the transfected 293 cells .
The 110-kDa protein is predicted by the cDNA recently reported by Park et al .
( 27 ) , and the 140-kDa protein is a new form of NFATc which has not been described previously ( see below ) .
Finally , the pan-NFAT serum 796 precipitated each of the NFATp , NFAT ' c , and NFAT4 proteins , as expected ( lanes 3 and 9 ) , and this precipitation was prevented in the presence of cognate peptide ( lanes 2 and 8 ) .
Thus , these NFAT antisera recognize their target proteins in Jurkat cells .
NFATp is expressed in untreated PBT 's , and NFATc is in-ducible .
Purified PBTs were treated with PMA or P+I for 2 h and then incubated in medium containing *°S-labeled amino acids for 2 additional h in the continued presence of the activating agents .
Control cells were radioactively labeled but not activated .
Whole-cell extracts were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Fig .
4A ) .

untreated and treated PBT 's contained a protein of 135 kDa which was precipitated by the pan-NFAT antiserum ( Fig .
4A , lanes 2 , 3 , 7 , and 11 ) .
Since this protein was also precipitated with anti-NFATp ( lanes 5 , 9 , and 13 ) but not with anti-NFATc ( lanes 4 and 12 ) or with anti-NFAT ' x ( lanes 6 , 10 , and 14 ) , it is evidently NFATp .
Both the pan-NFAT and NFATp antisera also precipitated a second protein with a molecular weight of about 100,000 from some samples ( lanes 2 , 3 , and 5 ) .
We have not yet determined whether this protein is a splice variant of NF-ATp , a result of proteolysis of NF-ATp in the extracts , or a cross-reaction of the serum with a new form of NFATe protein recently described by Park et al .
( 27 ) ( see below and Materials and Methods ) .
In any case , the major form of NFATp in PBTs is the 135-kDa protein , and it is constitutively expressed .
Its large size notwithstanding , this protein may correspond to a mixture of the two short alternatively spliced forms of NFATp ( 18 ) , denoted by the solid line in Fig .
1 ( see Discussion ) .
Treatment of cells with P+1I , but not with PMA alone , resulted in a prominent broadly migrating band with an average molecular weight of 86,000 .
This protein was precipitated by the pan-NFAT serum and anti-NFATc ( Fig .
4A , lanes 7 and 8 ) but not by anti-NFATp or anti-NFAT ' ( lanes 9 and 10 ) .
It is therefore NFAT ' c , whose size is consistent with the 716-amino-acid protein predicted by the sequence of Northrop et al .
( 26 ) .
A faint band at about the same position as NFATp was produced by anti-NFATc in cells treated with P+I ( lane 8 ) .
This is not a result of cross-reaction of NFATp with the NFATe antiserum but rather represents the novel NFAT ' c that was also seen in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2 ; see below ) .
The induction of the NFATc proteins was inhibited by CsA ( lanes 11 and 12 ) .
Thus , unlike the case for the Jurkat cells , there is little or no NFATe in untreated cells , but it is strongly induced by treatment with P+I .
In the experiment shown in Fig .
4A , anti-NFATs failed to detect a protein in either treated or untreated cells ( lanes 6 and 10 ) .
This result differs from that seen with Jurkat cells , where NFAT ' x was constitutively expressed at a high level .
In other experiments or after long exposure of films , we do see expression of NFAT ' x in both untreated and treated cells .
For example , Fig .
4B shows a 155-kDa form of NFAT4 in ionomycin-treated PBT 's .
The protein was precipitated by anti-NFAT4 1689 ( lane 1 ) , and precipitation was prevented by competing peptide ( lane 2 ) .

Immunoprecipitation of NFAT proteins .
( A ) PBTs were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium which contained PMA ( P ; 10 ng/m1 ) , P+I ( 1 pg/tl ) , P+1 plus CsA ( 500 ng/m ! 1 ) , or no activating agent ( Un ) for 2 h. The cells were then resuspended in a fresh aliquot of the same medium and incubated in the presence of [ *SJmethionine and [ **SJeysteine for 2 h. Whole-cell extracts were prepared in ELB buffer and were immunoprecipitated as described in Materials and Methods .
Precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Anti-NFAT ( « NFAT ) serum 796 recognizes all NFAT proteins ; anti-NFATc 801 recognizes NFATe ; anti-NFATp 1616 recognizes NFATp ; and anti-NFATx 1690 recognizes NFAT .
( B ) PBTs were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium for 2 h , the last 30 min of which included ionomycin ( 1 ) at 0.5 pg/ml .
The cells were then resuspended in a fresh aliquot of the same medium ( including ionomycin ) and incubated in the presence of *5S-amino acids for 2 h. Whole-cell extracts were prepared in ELB-SDS ; these were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Anti-NFAT4 1689 recognizes all forms of NFAT4 ; anti-NFATc 906 recognizes NFATc .
An asterisk indicates that precipitation was carried out in the presence of cognate peptide .
Vor .
17 , 1997 tein was also precipitated by the antiserum specific for NFAT ( data not shown ) .
However , expression of NFAT4/x was always very low ( compare its intensity with that of NFATe , precipitated from the same lysate [ lane 3 ] ) , and its level was unaffected by activating agents .
No shorter forms of NFAT4 ( cor-responding to the cDNAs called NFAT4a and -4b ) were ever seen in PBTs or Jurkat cells .
Finally , as in Jurkat cells , anti-NFAT3 antisera 889 and 890 showed no reactivity with extracts from untreated PBTs or from cells treated with P+1I ( see below ; also data not shown ) .
Taken together , the results demonstrate that NFATp and NFAT ' x are constitutively expressed in PBT 's and that NFATc is induced by ionomycin ( with or without PMA ) in a CsA-sensitive manner .
NFAT3 was not detected in PBT 's .
It may be useful to comment on the level of the NFAT proteins observed in PBT 's .
We routinely used lysate from 20 X 10° to 80 x 10° cells for a single immunoprecipitation , and films were exposed for 1 to 3 weeks .
In contrast , lysate from 3 X 10° Jurkat cells gave a strong signal in a few days .
This is consistent with the difference in size of PBTs and Jurkat cells ( protein content per cell is about 10 times higher in Jurkat cells ) and with the resting state of the PBT 's at the start of the experiments .
The relatively weak signal in PBT 's is not due to limiting antibody : immunoprecipitations ( for both PBT 's and Jurkat cells ) were carried out with the same volume of antiserum that was sufficient to precipitate entirely the much greater amount of NFAT proteins from transiently transfected cells .
There are multiple forms of NFATe .
While the 86-kDa protein was always the most prominent form precipitated by anti-NFATc 801 , additional bands also appeared .
As noted above , antiserum 801 detected additional proteins of 140 and 110 kDa in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3 ) , and it precipitated a protein of 140 kDa from PBT 's treated with P+I ( Fig .
4A , lane 8 ) .
A 140-kDa protein and a broadly migrating species of about 110 kDa were also seen in ionomycin-treated PBT 's by anti-NFATc 906 ( Fig .
4B , lane 3 ) .
We therefore investigated whether these 140- and 110-kDa proteins might be alternate forms of NFATc .
PBT 's were treated with P+I , and whole-cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the pan-NFAT serum 796 , with anti-NFATc 801 , or with three additional NFATe-specific antisera .
Each of these sera precipitated not only the major 86-kDa form of NFATc but also two additional forms with apparent sizes of 140 and 110 kDa ( Fig .
5A , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
Since these proteins were not precipitated by antisera directed at other NFAT family members ( Fig .
3 , lanes 10 and 11 ; Fig .
4A , lane 10 ; Fig .
5A , lane 6 ) , they must be alternate forms of NFATc .
The 110-kDa protein is presumably related to the cDNA recently reported by Park et al .
( 27 ) .
The 140-kDa form has not been described previously .
In addition to the higher-molecular-weight forms of NFATe , additional heterogeneity was suggested by the sequence of the cDNA that encodes the major 86-kDa protein ( 26 ) .
The first in-frame AUG codon lies in a context ill suited for translation initiation ( eggAUGc ) , while the context of the second is closer to optimal ( accAUGa ) ( 14 ) .
This sequence predicts two translated products : a minor form initiated at the first AUG and a major form derived from the second .
These two proteins would differ in size by the 36 amino acids upstream of the second initiation codon .
To test this prediction , we used an antiserum ( anti-NFATc 905 ) directed at the 14 N-terminal amino acids of the longer form .
This serum should detect only the longer form , whereas a serum raised against any epitope downstream of the second methionine should detect both forms .
In keeping with this prediction , antiserum 905 precipitated only a subset of the heterogeneous NFAT ' c population , and that subset con NFAT PROTEINS IN NORMAL HUMAN T CELLS - 2479 A P +I B P+ I aNFAT # 796 `` + Mba AM aNFATe # 801 M « NFAT # 796 + aNFATe # 904 + # 801 _ + aNFATe # 905 + # 905 + kDa aNFATe # 906 + my ag aNFAT3 # 890 + Dy WB - 200 @ -2*° - nraty _- i -+ » 6 4 Tm .

There are multiple forms of NFATe .
( A ) PBTs were treated with PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )
and ionomycin ( 1 mg/ml ) ( P+1 ) for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium and then radioactively labeled for 2 h in the continued presence of P+I .
Cells were lysed in ELB-SDS , and extracts were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Anti-NFAT ( « NFAT ) 796 recognizes all NFAT proteins ; anti-NFATe 801 , 904 , 905 , and 906 recognize NFATc ; anti-NFAT3 890 recognizes NFAT3 .
( B ) Jurkat cells were treated with P+I for 2 h and then radioactively labeled for 45 min in the continued presence of P+I .
Whole-cell extracts were prepared in ELB-SDS , and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Antisera are identified above .
sisted of the largest molecules ( Fig .
5A ; compare lane 4 with lanes 3 and 5 ) .
This was true for all three sizes of NFATec protein .
The same result was obtained in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
5B ; compare the 801 and 905 precipitates ) .
Thus , some NFATec molecules contain the 905 peptide and some do not .
This result is consistent with the possibility of two different initiation codons .
Although the 90-kDa protein precipitated by serum 905 was less heterogeneous in size than total NFATe , it did not migrate as a sharp band .
One possible explanation is that phosphorylation of NFATc results in the diffuse migration pattern .
To test whether NFATc is phosphorylated in cells treated with ionomycin alone or with P+I , NFATe immunoprecipitates ( antiserum 801 ) were digested with alkaline phosphatase before electrophoresis .
Digestion resulted in significantly increased mobility ( Fig .

Heterogeneity of NFATc .
( A ) PBTs were treated with ionomycin ( 1 ) ( 0.25 ug/ml ) or PMA ( 0.5 ng/m ! )
plus ionomycin ( P+1 ) for 1 h and then radioactively labeled in the continued presence of the activating agents for 2 h. Cells were lysed in ELB , and whole-cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-NFATe ( « NFATc ) 801 .
Precipitates were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) ( + ) or were untreated ( - ) before SDS-PAGE .
( B ) Human 293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing NFATe .
After 24 h , the cells were lysed in ELB-SDS , and the lysate was immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with anti-NFATe serum 801 or 905 .
Precipitates were untreated ( - ) or treated ( + ) with alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) and calcineurin ( CN ) .
The digested proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with anti-NFATe serum 801 .

and 3 ) , indicating that NFAT c is a phosphoprotein .
Treatment with P+1 resulted in slower migration of NFATe relative to treatment with ionomycin alone ( Fig .
6A , lanes 1 and 3 ) , suggesting that the protein is more extensively phosphorylated when PMA is present .
The same result has been seen with transiently transfected NFAT ' c in Jurkat cells ( 26 ) .
While phosphatase treatment increased NFATc mobility , it did not result in sharp bands .
( Notice that the 140- and 110-kDa NFAT c forms are practically undetectable in Fig .
6A .
This is because we deliberately chose a light exposure of the film , in an attempt to resolve distinct bands within the broadly migrating 86-kDa protein . )
This heterogeneity in size suggested that digestion was incomplete , even though the denatured protein was used as the substrate .
We tested this possibility in assays using overexpressed NFATc derived from transient transfection of the human 293 cell line .
We used the NFATc cDNA of Northrop et al .
( 26 ) , which encodes 716 amino acids and on which our prediction of two initiation codons is based .
As expected , expression of the NFATc plasmid resulted in a protein indistinguishable in size and heterogeneity from the major form seen in PBT 's ( Fig .
6B , lane 2 ) .
As with the PBT 's , mobility increased but heterogeneity remained after alkaline phosphatase treatment ( data not shown ) .
However , if the protein was treated with both alkaline phosphatase and calcineurin , sharp bands resulted .
Precipitation by antiserum 905 , followed by digestion , yielded a single band of about 86 kDa ( Fig .
6B , lane 4 ) .
Precipitation by antiserum 801 , followed by digestion , yielded two bands , of about 86 and 82 kDa ( Fig .
6B , lane 3 ) .
Thus , there are two forms of NFAT e encoded by the cDNA in the expression vector : a minor longer form which contains the 905 peptide and a shorter major form which does not .
The difference in their sizes agrees very well with the predicted 36-amino-acid difference in their lengths .
These results confirm the use of two different initiation codons in translation of this NFATe cDNA .
Similarly , the broad 86-kDa band seen in PBT 's and Jurkat cells most likely results from a combination of primary sequence heterogeneity and phosphorylation-induced heterogeneity .
NFATe is not induced by treatment with PMA plus anti-CD28 .
Results presented above show that there is little or no NFATc in untreated PBT 's but that its synthesis is strongly induced when cells are treated with ionomycin .
We have reported previously that PBT 's treated with PMA and anti-CD28 contain activated NFAT ( 6 ) .
To determine whether NFATc is induced by that treatment as well , we radioactively labeled treated cells and analyzed whole-cell extracts by immunopre-cipitation .
We found little or no induction of NFATe in cells stimulated with PMA plus anti-CD28 ( Fig .
7A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
There was a very low level of the 140-kDa NFATc detectable in untreated cells , and it increased only very slightly upon treatment .
In contrast , incubation in P+1I induced NFA¥Te strongly ( lane 4 ) , as expected , and the induction was sensitive to CsA ( lane 5 ) .
As usual , NFATp was detectable in untreated cells ( Fig .
7B , lane 1 ) , and its synthesis typically increased somewhat in cells treated with PMA plus anti-CD28 ( lane 2 ) , an effect which was not prevented by CsA ( lane 3 ) .
As in Jurkat cells , P+I treatment usually resulted in a lower level of NFAT p synthesis ( lane 4 ) , which may be due to toxicity of the treatment or to actual downregulation of synthesis , or both .
This effect was at least partially blocked by CsA ( lane 5 ) .
Whatever the cause , the effect was not unique to NFATp , as synthesis of the NF-kB proteins p105 and p65 was also lower in the cells treated with P+1I than in the cells treated with PMA and anti-CD28 ( Fig .
7C ) .
Comparison with NF-kB proteins is also useful in assessing the level of NFAT in PBT 's .

Treatment of PBTs with PMA plus anti-CD28 does not induce synthesis of NFATc .
PBTs were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium for 3.5 h , the last 45 min of which included PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )
plus anti-CD28 « CD28 ; 500 ng/m ! )
with or without CsA ( 500 ng/ml ) , PMA plus ionomycin ( 0.5 ug/ml ) with or without CsA , or no activating agents .
The cells were then labeled with S-amino acids in fresh aliquots of the same medium , including inducers , for 1.5 h. The cells were lysed in ELB-SDS .
Un. , untreated .
( A ) Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-NFATc 906 .
( B ) Supernatants from the precipitations shown in panel A were collected and reprecipitated with anti-NFATp 1777 .
( C ) Supernatants from the precipitations shown in panel B were collected and reprecipitated with a combination of anti-p65 and anti-p105/p50 .
and B were exposed for 7 days , while a comparable signal for the NF-kB protein p105 ( precipitated from the same volume of the same lysates ) was obtained on overnight exposure .
To monitor the effectiveness of PMA plus anti-CD28 treatment , cells were routinely screened for IL-2 production .
While incubation in PMA , ionomycin , or anti-CD28 alone resulted in no detectable IL-2 , treatment with PMA plus anti-CD28 gave significant levels , as did P+I .
Typical results following stimulation of the cells for 24 h were as follows : untreated cells , < 1.5 U of IL-2/ml ; PMA plus anti-CD28 , 329 U/ml ; PMA plus anti-CD28 plus CsA , 309 U/ml ; P+1I , 358 U/ml ; and P+I plus CsA , < 1.5 U/ml .
Thus , as previously reported ( 6 , 39 ) , IL-2 synthesis is insensitive to CsA in cells treated with PMA plus anti-CD28 , while its synthesis is completely CsA-sensitive in P+I-treated cells .
These results dramatize the very different effects of activating cultured cells with P+I compared with activating with PMA + anti-CD28 .
Both treatments induce synthesis of high levels of IL-2 , but P+1I activation utilizes a CsA-sensitive pathway and involves a strong induction of NFATe synthesis .

Stimulation of PBTs leads to nuclear NFAT DNA-binding activity .
( A ) PBTs were treated with PMA ( 5 ng/m ! )
plus ionomycin ( 0.5 pg/ml ) ( P+1 ) or PMA plus anti-CD28 ( 100 ug/ml ) ( P + « €CD28 ) for 4 h. Nuclear and cytoplasmic cell fractions were analyzed for the ability to bind a *°P-oligonucleotide containing the NFAT-binding site from the murine IL-4 gene .
Un , untreated .
( B ) Three micrograms of nuclear extract from cells treated with P+1 and 5 pg from cells treated with PMA plus anti-CD28 were subjected to supershift analysis ( same nuclear extracts as panel A ) .
For lanes 2 to 5 and 7 to 10 , NFAT-specific antibodies were added to the extracts prior to incubation with the P-labeled murine IL-4 NFAT probe .
Free probe is seen at the bottom of the gel .
« NFATc MAb 7A6 , monoclonal antibody 7A6 raised against NFATc .
( C ) 293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing NFAT , and whole-cell lysates were prepared 24 h later .
Aliquots were analyzed by EMSA with or without NFAT-specific antibodies , using the *°P-labeled murine IL-4 NFAT probe .
In lane 1 , the extract from mock-transfected cells was used as a negative control .
contrast , activation by PMA plus anti-CD28 is CsA insensitive and does not result in induction of NFATe .
Stimulation of PBT 's leads to nuclear NFAT DNA-binding activity .
To assess the effect of stimulation on NFAT DNA-binding activity , PBTs were treated with P+I or PMA plus anti-CD28 , separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions , and subjected to EMSA .
As a probe , we used the murine IL-4 promoter NFAT -binding site , which can bind NFAT alone and does not require cobinding by AP-1 .
In untreated cells , all of the DNA-binding activity was located in the cytoplasm , as expected ( Fig .
8A , lanes 1 and 4 ) .
After treatment of the cells with P+I for 4 h , nearly all of the DNA-binding activity was nuclear ( lanes 2 and 5 ) .
In contrast , treatment of the cells with PMA plus anti-CD28 resulted in some nuclear DNA-binding activity ( lane 6 ) but a high level of residual cytoplasmic NFAT as well ( lane 3 ) .
Thus , both treatments result in NFAT trans-location , but P+I appears to be more efficient , at least with the concentrations of reagents used in these assays .
The identities of the nuclear NFAT proteins were tested by supershift analysis ( Fig .
8B ) .
In agreement with the immunoprecipitation results , only NFATp was detected in nuclear extracts from cells treated with PMA plus anti-CD28 .
With the murine IL-4 NFAT-binding site as a probe , the binding activity ( lane 5 ) was blocked completely by the pan-NFAT serum ( lane 7 ) and was supershifted efficiently by anti-NFATp ( lane 8 ) .
Neither anti-NFATc 801 nor monoclonal antibody 7A6 ( raised against recombinant NFATc ) had any effect ( lanes 9 and 10 ) .
In spite of the fact that both NFATp and NFATe were readily detectable in cells stimulated with P+1I , nearly all of the DNA-binding activity was due to NFATp .
This was true regardless of which NFAT site was used as probe and of which anti-NFATe serum was used for supershifting .
For example , with the murine IL-4 NFAT site as probe , the pan-NFAT serum blocked binding completely ( Fig .
8B , lanes 2 ) , and anti-NFATp 1616 supershifted almost completely ( lane 4 ) .
Anti-NFATe 801 and monoclonal antibody 7A6 shifted only a very small portion of the DNA-binding activity ( lanes 3 and 5 ) .
With the distal NFAT-binding site from the human IL-2 promoter as a probe , the pan- NFAT serum again blocked binding completely , but four different anti-NFATc sera failed to shift or block significantly ( data not shown ) .
Thus , although NFATc was easily detectable by immunoprecipitation , and although essentially all NFAT was nuclear in these cells ( data not shown ) , it did not appear to represent a significant fraction of the DNA-binding activity .
One possible explanation for the failure to detect DNA binding by NFATe is that the NFATe-specific antisera are ineffective supershifters .
To test their abilities to supershift or inhibit an NFATe-containing DNA-binding complex , 293 cells were transiently transfected with an NFAT ' c expression vector , and whole-cell extracts were analyzed in EMSA with the murine IL-4 probe .
Overexpressed NFAT ' c bound the DNA very well ( Fig .
8C , lane 2 ) , and , as in extracts from PBT 's , the pan- NFAT serum blocked this binding completely ( lane 3 ) .
As expected , anti-NFATp 1616 was unable to supershift the complex ( lane 5 ) , but both NFATc antibodies 801 and 7A6 shifted it completely ( lanes 4 and 6 ) .
This was true of the three additional NFATc peptide antisera as well ( data not shown ) .
In addition , anti-NFATe 801 supershifted NFATc in extracts from Jurkat cells treated with P+1 ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the NFATc antisera are capable of recognizing NFATc when it is bound to DNA , yet they detect little or no NFATe in DNA-binding complexes from P+I-treated PBT 's .
We conclude that nearly all of the DNA-binding activity in such cells is due to NFATp .
DISCUSSION Given the central role played by NFAT in cytokine production , it is important to understand its regulation .
This is likely to be a complicated task since four different NFAT family members have been identified , and at least three of these have alternatively spliced forms ( 11 , 21 , 24 , 27 ) .
Many of these forms have been seen only at the cDNA level in libraries from established T-cell lines .
To determine which NFAT proteins are present in normal cells , we have examined highly purified human PBT 's in immunoprecipitation experiments .
In untreated T cells , the major form of NFAT was NFATp , 2482 LYAKH ET AL .
whose size was reduced from about 135 kDa to about 125 kDa by ( possibly incomplete ) phosphatase digestion ( data not shown ) .
Although this size is consistent with the longest of the alternatively spliced cDNAs described by McCaffrey et al .
( 24 ) and by Luo et al .
( 18 ) , it is likely that it actually corresponds to the two shorter forms ( denoted by the solid line in Fig .
1 ) .
In assays using antisera specific to each of the three NFATp forms , it has been shown that murine T cells express predominantly the two short forms , whose apparent sizes are about 140 kDa ( 42 ) .
In addition , when cDNA encoding the longest form ( containing the region denoted by the dashed line in Fig .
1 ) was transfected into COS cells , the resulting protein migrated significantly more slowly than the predominant form in murine T cells ( 18 ) .
We assume that , like the mouse cells , human T cells are expressing the shorter NFAT p , but we caution that we do not yet have an antiserum that can distinguish between the short and long forms .
NFATp protein of approximate size 120 to 140 kDa has also been observed in human and murine T-and B-cell lines ( 25 , 28 , 34 ) , in human NK cells and T-cell blasts induced by phytohemagglutinin ( 1 ) , and in a neuronal cell line and some regions of the nervous system ( 8 ) .
Unlike NFATp , little or no NFATe was detected in untreated cells .
( Since our experiments involve metabolic labeling of cells , we can not rule out the possibility that NFATe exists in resting T cells but turns over significantly more slowly than does NFATp . )
However , like NFATe mRNA ( 1 , 21 , 26 ) , we found that NFATc protein was strongly induced by treatment of the cells with ionomycin , with or without PMA .
The major form of the protein produced a broad band in SDS-PAGE , with an average size of about 86 kDa .
This protein has not been found previously in any cell type , but its size is consistent with that encoded by the NFATc cDNA described by Northrop et al .
( 26 ) .
We found that the size heterogeneity resulted from two factors : ( i ) phosphorylation and ( ii ) a difference in primary sequence .
Transient transfection of NFATc cDNA resulted in two forms of the protein , both of which were phosphorylated .
These two forms differed by about 4 kDa and resulted from initiation of translation at two different AUG codons .
Since antiserum specific for the longer form also recognized only a subset of NFATc in PBT 's , we think it likely that the two initiation codons are used there as well .
Of course , we can not exclude the possibility that in PBT 's the two forms arise through alternative splicing .
However , given the observed difference in their sizes and antibody reactivity , such alternatively spliced forms would have to be essentially the same as those translated from a single cDNA using two different AUG codons .
In addition to the major 86-kDa NFATce , denoted by the solid line in Fig .
1 , we also detected two additional forms , of about 110 kDa and 140 kDa .
The 110-kDa protein may be related to the NFATe cDNA recently described by Park et al .
( 27 ) ; the protein predicted by that cDNA would encompass both the solid and dashed lines in Fig .
1 .
However , that cDNA also differs at its extreme N terminus from the Northrop et al .
cDNA , in that the Park et al .
clone replaces the first 42 residues ( counting from the methionine encoded by the first , weak AUG codon ) with 29 different residues .
Antiserum 905 would not recognize that protein .
Therefore , since antiserum 905 does recognize a protein of about 110 kDa in both PBT 's and Jurkat cells , there may be three NFATc proteins in this size range : one encoded by the Park et al .
cDNA and two encoded by a cDNA of similar size which contains the Northrop et al .
N terminus .
No cDNA corresponding to the 140-kDa NFATc has been described , but various cell types express an NFATc mRNA of 4.5 to 5.2 kb , which is large enough to encode it ( 11 , 21 , 27 ) .
Given Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
the pattern set by the other NFAT proteins , it seems likely that the increased length of the 140-kDa NFATc results from further extension at the C terminus over that seen in the 110-kDa protein .
To date , there is very little functional information about the region downstream of the RHD in the NFAT proteins .
A transactivation domain has been found in this region in NFATp ( 19 ) , but the 86-kDa form of NFATe , which terminates at essentially the C terminus of the RHD , can activate transcription in reporter assays ( 6 , 11 , 26 ) .
Interaction of NFATp with AP-1 appears to be governed by sequences within the RHD ( 12 , 25 ) , and interaction with calcineurin apparently occurs in the region upstream of the RHD ( 17 , 20 , 37 , 43 ) .
It is therefore difficult to predict what functional differences exist among the various NFATc forms .
Of the other known NFAT family members , we were unable to detect NFAT3 in PBT 's .
This is not surprising , since NFAT3 mRNA has not been observed in spleen , thymus , or peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 11 ) .
We did detect one of the splice variants of NFAT4 , called NFATx ( 21 ) .
Like NFATp , it was present in untreated cells but at a very low level that did not change upon treatment of the cells with P+1I or PMA plus anti-CD28 .
The shorter forms of NFAT4 , called NFAT 4a and -4b , were not detected in PBT 's or in Jurkat cells .
In summary , we detected NFATp , three forms of NFAT , and NFAT in PBT 's .
With the possible exception of NFAT4c ( whose predicted size should be indistinguishable from that of NFAT ' x ) , we believe that this is likely to be a complete list of the major NFAT proteins in these cells .
All of the proteins precipitated by the pan-NFAT serum have been accounted for , using the NFATp- , NFATe- , and NFATx-specific sera .
All other bands are either very faint , not reproducible , or clearly nonspecific .
Our results raise several interesting questions relevant to NFAT function .
First , what are the transcription factors that regulate NFATc synthesis ?
We observed little or no NFATc protein in untreated cells but a strong CsA-sensitive induction of its synthesis in ionomycin-treated cells .
These results suggest that preexisting NFATp , which translocates to the nucleus following treatment of cells with ionomycin ( 17 , 36 ) , might be important for NFAT c mRNA synthesis .
However , it was shown recently that NFATc can be found in T-cell lines established from NFATp-deficient mice , as judged by DNA binding and supershift assays using anti-NFATec monoclonal antibody 7A6 ( 44 ) .
An alternative regulatory mechanism might involve trans-lational repression of a low level of preexisting NFAT c mRNA in untreated cells and Ca**-induced derepression .
NFATe protein itself might then upregulate NFATe gene transcription .
Second , is NFAT required for IL-2 synthesis by normal human PBTs ?
Moderate levels of IL-2 are synthesized following treatment of T cells with PMA plus anti-CD28 ( references 6 and 39 and this report ) , and we have shown that only NFATp and trace levels of NFAT ' x were detectable under these conditions .
Yet IL-2 synthesis is normal in NFATp-negative cells treated with concanavalin A or anti-CD3 ( 10 , 44 ) , suggesting either that NFATp is not involved in IL-2 synthesis or that the normal role of NFATp can be filled by another NFAT family member in the deficient cells .
It would be interesting to know whether NFATp-negative T cells can synthesize IL-2 in response to treatment with PMA plus anti-CD28 .
Third , what triggers the nuclear translocation of NFAT p in cells treated with PMA plus anti-CD28 ?
Normally , NFAT translocation requires the Ca**-induced activation of calcineurin , which can be brought about by ligation of CD3 or by treatment with ionomycin .
Since it involves calcineurin , this pathway is CsA sensitive .
However , PMA-anti-CD28-induced Vor .
17 , 1997 translocation of NFATp is CsA resistant , as is IL-2 synthesis in these cells ( references 6 and 39 and this report ) .
This finding suggests either that PMA plus anti-CD28 induces a different Ca** -independent phosphatase that can act on NFATp or that there are ways other than dephosphorylation to effect NFATp translocation .
Fourth , why were we unable to detect significant DNA binding by NFATc in extracts from P+I-treated cells ?
Judging from the immunoprecipitation experiments , there is as much NFATc as NFATp in those cells , yet nearly all of the DNA-binding activity was due to NFATp .
This was true regardless of which of three different NFAT-binding sites was used as a probe .
However , transfected NFATc was able to bind DNA , and the NFATc antisera were able to supershift the complex .
Similarly , NFATc was detected in the DNA-binding complex from Jurkat cells treated with P+1I .
These results suggest that we would have detected NFATe in the T-cell extracts if it constituted a significant fraction of the total binding activity .
Therefore , perhaps the relative intensities of the NFATp and NFATc bands in the immunoprecipitation experiments do not accurately reflect the absolute levels of the two proteins , and we have considerably overestimated the amount of NFATe present in the activated T cells .
In a similar experiment , Aram-buru et al .
( 1 ) found that CD16 ligand binding or P+1 induced NFATc mRNA synthesis in human NK cells , but they were also unable to detect DNA binding by NFATc protein in nuclear extracts .
DNA binding by NFAT ' c was detected after CD3 ligation in murine T cells but not after treatment with ionomycin ( 16 ) .
Finally , does PMA-induced phosphorylation of NFAT have functional consequences ?
NFAT c migrated more slowly in extracts from cells treated with P+1I than in extracts from ionomycin-treated cells .
This was also true for NFATp ( data not shown ) .
This PMA-induced phosphorylation is not required for nuclear translocation of NFATp , which occurs in cells treated with ionomycin alone , but may possibly contribute to DNA binding , to transcriptional activity , or to interaction with other transcription factors .
