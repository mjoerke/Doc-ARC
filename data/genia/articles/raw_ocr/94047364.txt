Here it is shown that ZEBRA also behaves as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
Deletional mutagenesis defined three regions of ZEBRA that participate in activation in S. cerevisiae .
These regions are designated YI ( amino acids [ aa ] 1 to 25 ) , YI ( aa 51 to 102 ) , and YIII ( aa 228 to 245 ) .
Two of the three regions of the native ZEBRA protein act together to mediate activation when assayed on ZEBRA binding sites .
However , when fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and assayed on GALA binding sites , regions YH and YIII were each sufficient to confer activation in S. cerevisiae .
Regions of ZEBRA which affected activation in S. cerevisiae were also required in human B lymphocytes .
The amino-terminal region of ZEBRA ( aa 1 to 98 ) was required for activation both in S. cerevisiae and in human B cells ; deletion of the carboxy-terminal 18 aa also significantly reduced activation in both cell types .
Thus , the behavior of ZEBRA in human B cells and 8. cerevisiae suggests that the protein contains universal activation motifs that interact with conserved components of the transcription machinery .
However , certain deletion mutants of ZEBRA containing mutations in the N-terminal region exhibited discordant behaviors in S. cerevisiae and in B cells .
For example , deletion of ZEBRA aa 26 to 51 impaired activation to a great extent in B cells but had little or no effect in S. cerevisiae .
The discordant mutants may reflect interactions with a variable domain of a conserved component or unique interactions with specialized components of the basal transcription apparatus in different cells .
ZEBRA protein initiates a cascade of events leading to expression of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic-cycle genes ( 1 , 7 , 32 ) .
ZEBRA activates transcription by binding to ZEBRA response elements ( ZREs ) found in the promoters of its target EBV lytic-cycle genes ( 5 , 9 , 28 , 47 , 49 ) .
Some ZREs are related to mammalian AP-1 recognition sequences ; however , ZEBRA also recognizes sites which are distinct from those bound by AP-1 .
Like other eukaryotic activators , ZEBRA is a modular protein ( 37 ) , and its domain structure generally corresponds to its exon composition .
An activating region is present in the N-terminal portion ( approximately amino acids [ aa ] 1 to 100 ) , and the DNA recognition and dimerization domains are found in the C-terminal portion ( aa 167 to 245 ) ( 10 , 11 , 15 , 26 , 36 , 47 ) .
ZEBRA stimulates transcription in many different mammalian cell types and in vitro in HeLa cell extracts ( 4 , 26 ) .
Thus , activation of transcription by ZEBRA requires neither B-cell-specific nor EBV-specific factors .
These results suggest that ZEBRA interacts with one or more conserved components of the mammalian basal transcription apparatus .
Some mammalian cellular and viral transcriptional activators function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells , and certain yeast activators function in mammalian cells ( 10 , 12 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 42 , 45 , 50 ) .
In one approach to demonstrate that a mammalian activating region functions in S. cerevisiae , the activator , or a portion thereof , is fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain .
For example , c-fos fused to the DNA binding * Corresponding author .
7472 domain present in aa 1 to 87 of the bacterial LexA repressor protein will stimulate transcription in S. cerevisiae of reporter genes bearing nearby LexA-binding sites ( 25 ) .
Similarly , the activating domain of the mammalian herpes simplex virus protein VP16 , when fused to the DNA binding domain contained in aa 1 to 147 of the yeast GAL4 protein , will activate transcription from GAL4 sites in S. cerevisiae ( 2 , 6 ) .
When the mammalian activator is itself a DNA binding protein , such as the bovine papillomavirus E2 protein , it can be shown to stimulate transcription in S. cerevisige from reporter genes which bear E2 cognate binding sites ( 24 , 34 ) .
The activity of the bovine papillomavirus E2 protein can be measured in such an assay because E2 binding sites are not recognized by a yeast factor .
Among the long-range objectives of such experiments in $ .
cerevisiae is to define conserved cellular proteins which interact with the mammalian activator and to analyze the mode of activation of downstream target genes .
Experiments in S. cerevisiae may help to distinguish transcriptional regulatory regions which are directly and solely acted upon by the activator from those that require complex interactions between groups of proteins bound to the same promoter .
The experiments presented here have explored the capacity of ZEBRA to behave as an activator in S. cerevisiae .
These experiments show that ZEBRA is able to activate transcription in S. cerevisiae when bound to promoters by its own DNA binding domain .
Portions of ZEBRA also function as activating regions in S. cerevisiae when fused to the DNA binding domain of GALA .
By use of deletion mutants , the regions of ZEBRA necessary Vor .

cerevisiae and in human B lymphocytes were compared .
One region of ZEBRA which is dispensable for activation of transcription in S. cerevisiae is required in human B cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and media .
Activation by intact ZEBRA and by mutants with internal , N-terminal , C-terminal , and point mutations thereof was assayed in yeast strain W3031A ( MATa can l-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trpl-1 ura3-1 ade2-1 ) obtained from Rodney Rothstein , Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons .
This strain is GAL4* ; GALA is required to activate the GALLI promoter from which ZEBRA was expressed ( 22 ) .
Activation by chimeric proteins containing the DNA binding domain of GAL4 fused to ZEBRA or portions of ZEBRA was assayed in several yeast strains .
Strain YT6 : :171 ( MATa gal4-542 gal80-538 ura 3-52 his 3-200 ade2-101 adel lys2-801 trp1-901 arol leu2-3,112 mell Met ) bears an integrated reporter which contains a portion of the GAL ] promoter , UAS , ; fused to lacZ ( 51 ) .
Strain P56:171 is con-genic to YT6 : :171 but bears the GAL1IP ( potentiator ) mutation , which converts weak activators , fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 , into strong activators ( 18 ) .
Strain JPY9 ( MATa ura3-52 his3 A200 AI trpl A63 lys2 A385 gal4A11 ) was derived from FY250 provided by Fred Winston , Department of Genetics , Harvard Medical School .
Media were prepared as described by Sherman et al .
( 43 ) .
Reporters .
The reporter plasmid pCZA , shown in Fig .
1A , contains a minimal CYCZ/ promoter , including the TATA element , fused to the B-galactosidase gene ( 28 ) .
It also contains the selectable gene URA3 and a yeast chromosomal origin of replication and a centromere ( CEN4 ) .
Oli-gomers containing different numbers ( 1 , 3 , 5 , or 7 ) of ZIIIB sites were inserted into an Xbatl site in a polylinker upstream of the CYC ! -lacZ fusion carried on this plasmid ( 4 ) .
The sequence of the 14-bp oligonucleotide used to make these reporters is 5° GGCATTGCTAATGT 3 ' .
( The ZIIIB site is underlined . )
A reporter which lacks ZEBRA binding sites contained a 714-bp EcoRI-to-Ncol fragment of EBV DNA which encompasses the repeated element in orfP inserted into the EcoRI site of the polylinker .
The reporter 3GAL/CZ contains three oligomerized 17-mer GAL4 binding sites in the pCZA polylinker ( 6 ) .
Activators .
The plasmid vector for the activators was pBM125 carrying a LEU2 marker , a gift from James Wang , Harvard University ( Fig .
1B ) .
In pBM125 , an 850-bp EcoRI-to-BamHI fragment contains the galactose-inducible GAL /-GALIO promoter ( 22 ) .
pBM125 contains an ARSZ origin of replication and CEN4 .
The activator pBM125/Z ( 1-245 ) [ Z ( 1-245 ) ] contains a BZLFI cDNA inserted into the unique BamHI site of pBM125 .
In the activator Z ( 1-227 ) +VP16 , aa 1 to 227 of the ZEBRA cDNA have been fused in frame at the HinclI site with aa 411 to 490 of VP16 ( 1 , 48 ) ; this was cloned as a BamHI fragment into pBM125 .
Several internal-deletion mutants of ZEBRA were cloned into pBM125 as BamHI or BamHI-to-Sall fragments .
These mutants include Z ( 1-25 , 89-245 ) , which contains a deletion of the sequences spanned by the two HindIII sites in the BZLFI cDNA , and Z ( 1-25 , 141-245 ) , which contains a deletion between the leftmost HindIII site and the Nhel site ( 1 ) .
Two mutants with altered amino acids in the basic domain of exon II , constructed by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis , were obtained from E. Flemington .
They are M178-180 , in which KRY has been changed to EEL , and M187-189 , in which FUNCTIONS OF ZEBRA REGIONS IN YEAST AND B CELLS 7473 RKC has been altered to EES .
These mutants do not bind DNA in vitro ( 47 ) .
N-terminal-deletion mutants .
A set of nested amino-termi-nal-deletion mutants of ZEBRA was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .
The primers contained , in 5'-to0-3 ' direction , 5° AGATCTGCCGCCGCCATG 3 ' , followed by 15 nucleotides complementary to the 5 boundary of the deletion end point .
This primer contains a Bg/l site , followed by a consensus translation enhancer sequence , followed by a translation initiator codon .
The mutants began at aa 2 , 25 , 52 , 77 , 99 , and 131 of ZEBRA .
The primer flanking the 3 ' end of the ZEBRA gene contained a BamHI site GGATCC preceded by 15 nucleotides complementary to the DNA encoding the carboxy terminus of ZEBRA .
The PCR products were cleaved with Bg/ll and BamHI and inserted into pBXG1 cut with BeiII and BamHI .
They were subcloned into the yeast vector pBM125 .
which was cut with BamHI and Salil .
The 3 '' end of the ZEBRA gene was a Bg/lI-Pstl fragment of the BZLFI cDNA cloned into pBluescript .
This strategy was used in order to preserve the stop codon at the end of the BZLFI open reading frame .
The nucleotide sequence of the N-terminal-deletion mutants was determined in the yeast plasmids by the Sanger method .
GAL4 fusions .
PCR primers for GAL4-ZEBRA fusion proteins were either the same as those used in the ZEBRA amino-terminal deletions or new ones constructed by placing a BamHI site 5 and cither a BamHI site or a BefIl site 3 ' to the coding sequence of interest .
These PCR products were cleaved with Bg/l1 and BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of pBXG1 , which contains the simian virus 40 enhancer driving expression of DNA encoding aa 1 to 147 of GAL4 [ GALA ( I-147 ) ] ( 41 ) .
This created an in-frame fusion with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 .
The GAL4-ZEBRA fusions were then subcloned into two yeast expression vectors .
pMA424 and pGG29 .
pMA424 is a 2m plasmid in which GAL4 ( 1-147 ) is driven by the ADH 1T promoter ( 30 ) .
pGG29 is an ARSI CEN3 plasmid which contains GAL4 ( 1-147 ) driven by the GAL4 promoter , a gift from Grace Gill , Department of Biochemistry , University of California at Berkeley .
The junction between GAL4 ( 1-147 ) and ZEBRA was sequenced .
B-Galactosidase assays .
S. cerevisiae was transformed by a lithium acetate method with 5 ul of Escherichia coli minilysate plasmid DNA plus 50 ug of calf thymus DNA as the carrier ( 21 ) .
Yeast cells were plated onto a nitrocellulose filter placed on the appropriate synthetic complete ( SC ) yeast medium drop-out plates containing 2 % glucose .
After the colonies were visible ( after about 48 h ) , the filters were transferred to X-Gal ( 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-B- » -galactopyranoside ) indicator medium drop-out plates containing 2 % galactose ( 43 ) .
The extent of activation of LacZ was scored qualitatively by inspection of the X-Gal plates .
Individual representative colonies were subcultured from the X-Gal plate to a liquid SC drop-out culture containing 2 % glucose .
After overnight incubation , the cultures were washed once with SC and resuspended in drop-out medium containing 2 % galactose .
These cultures were further incubated overnight and were harvested for B-galactosidase assay .
The cells were fractured by vortexing with glass beads .
The level of B-galactosidase activity was measured as described elsewhere ( 18 ) , and the protein content was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein determination kit .
B-Galactosidase activity was calculated as 1,000 x the optical density at 420 nm/time ( minutes ) x the optical density at 595 nm X volume ( milliliters ) .
Human B-cell transfections .
Transcriptional activation by ZEBRA and ZEBRA deletion mutants was assayed in the EBV-negative human B-cell line BJAB .

Activation of transcription by ZEBRA in S. cerevisiae .
( A ) Reporter plasmids .
Different numbers of oligomerized ZIIIB sites [ ( ZIIIB ) n ] , to which ZEBRA binds , were cloned into an Xbal site in a multiple-cloning site ( MCS ) in the vector pCZA ( 29 ) .
As a control , a 700-bp fragment containing oriP , to which ZEBRA does not bind , was placed in the MCS in pCZA .
The reporter contains a 144-bp minimal promoter from the yeast CYCI gene upstream of lacZ .
( B ) Activator plasmids .
Derivatives of a cDNA of the BZLFI1 gene encoding ZEBRA were cloned as BamHI or BamHI-Sall fragments downstream of the 850-bp GAL I-GAL10 ( GAL1/10 ) promoter in the plasmid pBM125 .
( C ) Two activator plasmids which contain ZEBRA .
The top line shows the approximate location of the activating , DNA recognition , and dimerization regions of ZEBRA .
Restriction endonuclease recognition sites used for preparation of internal-deletion mutants ( see Fig .
2B ) and ZEBRA-VP16 fusions are shown .
Z ( 1-245 ) is an intact BZLF1 cDNA .
Z ( 1-227 ) + VP16 has the carboxy-terminal 18 aa of ZEBRA removed and replaced with aa 411 to 490 of VP16 ( 1 ) .
( D ) Data from a representative experiment .
Yeast strain W3031A was cotransfected with one activator plasmid and one reporter plasmid .
The activator was Z ( 1-245 ) or Z ( 1-227 ) +VP16 or , as a negative control , the pBM125 vector .
The reporters were derivatives of pCZA containing no ZIIIB elements or one , three , five , or seven ZIIIB elements upstream of the minimal CYC7 promoter fused to lacZ .
Stimulation is calculated as the ratio of B-galactosidase units expressed from a reporter after exposure to an activator to the number of B-galactosidase units expressed from the same reporter in the presence of the vector pBM125 .
and C-terminal-deletion mutant activators were cloned in pHD1013 , which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer ( 8 ) .
The N-terminal-deletion mutant activators were cloned downstream of the simian virus 40 promoter-enhancer in pBXG1 , a gift from P. Broad ( 41 ) .
The reporter was Z3EA4CAT , in which three oligomerized ZIIIB sites were inserted upstream of the minimal adenovirus E4 promoter , fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) ( 4 , 16 ) .
Cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 ug of activator and 10 pg of reporter .
CAT assays were performed with 30 pl of cell extract prepared 48 h after transfection .
Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with polyvalent rabbit anti-sera to ZEBRA .
RESULTS Experimental design .
The capacity of ZEBRA to activate transcription in S. cerevisiae was examined in two types of experiments .
In one type , activators were expressed from plasmid constructs encoding the native DNA binding and dimerization domains of ZEBRA itself ( aa 167 to 227 ) together with various portions of the remainder of the ZEBRA protein ( Fig .
1C ) .
In these experiments , transcription was measured from reporter genes containing one , three , five , or seven oligomerized ZIIIB ZREs upstream of a CYC ! -lacZ fusion .
In the other set of experiments , the activators consisted of ZEBRA , or portions thereof , fused to the DNA binding domain ( aa 1 to 147 ) of the yeast activator , GAL4 .
Reporter genes contained GAL4 binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter ( CYC ) or GAL1 ) fused to lacZ .
In both types of experiments , B-galactosidase activity served as a measure of transcription .
The ZEBRA deletion mutants were also examined for their capacity to activate transcription in an EBV-negative human B-lymphocyte cell line .
The reporter used in B cells contained three oligomerized ZIIIB sites upstream of a minimal adenovirus E4 gene promoter fused to the CAT gene ( 4 , 16 ) .
CAT activity served as a measure of transcription .
ZEBRA is a sequence-specific activator in S. cerevisiae .
As shown in Fig .
1D , ZEBRA activated transcription in S. cerevisige from reporter genes bearing one or more ZREs .
ZEBRA failed to activate transcription from a reporter gene lacking ZEBRA binding sites ( pCZA ) or from a reporter gene containing 20 copies of a 30-bp repeat from the EBV latent origin of replication ( oriP ) to which the EBV protein EBNA-1 binds but to which ZEBRA does not bind ( data not shown ) .
The capacity of ZEBRA to activate transcription from reporters bearing single or multiple ZIIIB ZREs was eliminated by mutations which destroyed the ability of ZEBRA to bind to DNA .
Mutants Z ( M178-180 ) and Z ( M187-189 ) , in which basic amino acids required for DNA binding are changed to acidic ones , no longer activated transcription from reporters containing oligomerized ZREs ( Fig .
2B and data not shown ) .
Fig .
1D shows that ZEBRA was a weak activator in S. cerevisiae .
Addition of the VP16 activation domain to ZEBRA in the mutant Z ( 1-227 ) +VP16 created an activator fivefold more potent than wild-type ZEBRA .
As is characteristic of many weak eukaryotic activators , ZEBRA activated transcription in a synergistic fashion ( 4 ) .
In S. cerevisiae , ZEBRA only weakly activated ( 4-fold ) transcription from a reporter with one ZIIIB site and maximally stimulated ( 32-fold in the experiment illustrated ) transcription from reporters containing three tandem ZIIIB sites .

Activation of transcription by ZEBRA N-terminal-deletion mutants ( A ) and internal-deletion and point mutants ( B ) in S. cerevi-sige .
The data are averages for duplicate experiments with each set of mutants .
The experiments were conducted in yeast strain W3031A .
The vertical lines represent the level of B-galactosidase activity ( 137 units ) as a measure of background transcription from the Z3/CZ reporter ( a derivative of pCZA containing three oligomerized ZIIIB sites ) cotransfected with the pBM125 vector .
The stimulation index is the ratio of B-galactosidase units measured in yeast cells carrying an activator to those measured in yeast cells carrying the vector pBM125 .
7476 MILLER ET AL .
three adjacent sites was 8-fold that on one site ; this is 2.5-fold synergy , comparing three sites with one site .
The background level of transcription measured in the absence of an activator increased when reporters contained five or seven oligomerized ZIIIB sites ( Fig .
1D ) .
This high background level of transcription , which was not observed from the reporter bearing 20 copies of the 30-bp repeat elements from oriP ( data not shown ) , is presumably due to the action of a yeast factor which recognizes the oligomerized ZIIB sites and whose activity required a high degree of synergy .
An N-terminal and a C-terminal region of ZEBRA are required for activation of transcription in S. cerevisiae .
The deletion mutants illustrated in Fig .
2 defined two separate regions of ZEBRA protein which were required for activation of transcription in S. cerevisiae .
One region was the amino-terminal 98 aa , and the other was the carboxy-terminal 18 aa .
A nested set of deletion mutants of increasing size from the amino terminus showed a progressive decrease in activity ( Fig .
2A ) .
There was greater-than-50 % reduction of activity following removal of the N-terminal 24 aa .
Removal of the N-terminal 76 aa caused a 76 % reduction of activity , and removal of the N-terminal 98 or 130 aa eliminated the capacity of the protein to activate transcription .
Deletion of the second required region , located in the carboxy-terminal 18 amino acids , in the mutant Z ( 1-227 ) reduced the capacity of the protein to activate to less than 20 % of the wild-type activity ( Fig .
2B and data not shown ) .
A reduction of activity comparable to that measured on reporters with three oligomerized ZIIIB sites was observed on reporters containing five or seven oligomerized ZIIIB sites ( data not shown ) .
Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Z ( 1-227 ) was synthesized at the same level as Z ( 1-245 ) ( data not shown ) .
We observed a modest decrease in activation potency in internal-deletion mutants from which aa 26 to 140 were removed .
Thus the mutant Z ( 1-25 , 89-245 ) was 85 % as active as the wild type , and the mutant Z ( 1-25 , 141-245 ) was 78 % as active as the wild type ( Fig .
2B ) .
If , however , these internal deletions were combined with deletion of the C-terminal 18 aa , as in the mutant Z ( 1-26 , 141-227 ) , the protein was inactive .
These data suggested that the N-terminal 25 aa and the C-terminal 18 aa of ZEBRA were both required to create a functional activator in S. cerevisice .
The required C-terminal activating region of ZEBRA could be replaced by VP16 , as in the mutant Z ( 1-227 ) +VP16 ( Fig .
1D ) .
Intact ZEBRA and portions of the ZEBRA protein fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 behave as activators in S. cerevisiae .
In preliminary experiments , the entire BZLFI cDNA encoding ZEBRA was fused to GAL4 ( 1-147 ) and expressed from the strong constitutive promoter on the plasmid pMA424 , which contains a high-copy-number yeast 2m-plasmid origin of replication .
High-level expression of ZEBRA under these conditions was toxic to several strains of 8. cerevisiae , as evident by the appearance of small colonies on SC glucose plates .
These small colonies developed a dark blue color when transferred to X-Gal plates , indicative of high-level transcriptional activation .
Strain JPY9 was least affected among several strains tested .
In this strain , GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-245 ) activated transcription about 14-fold from GALA binding sites and about 24-fold from ZEBRA binding sites ( Fig .
3A ) .
Thus the intact ZEBRA protein fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 behaved in a manner consistent with the protein containing two different DNA binding domains .
Two constructs containing the N-terminal activating region of ZEBRA , namely GALA4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-198 ) and GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-93 ) , both activated transcription in this assay .
Since these two constructs lack J. ViroL .

Activation of transcription by ZEBRA or portions of ZEBRA fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 .
( A ) Comparison of activation on GAL4 ( shaded bars ) and ZEBRA ( open bars ) binding sites .
The data are pooled from five experiments .
JPY9 ( gal4A11 ) yeast cells were cotransfected with a GAL4-derived activator and a reporter .
The two reporters were derivatives of pCZA containing three oligomerized GAL4 binding sites ( 3GAL/CZ ) or three oligomerized ZIHB sites ( Z3/CZ ) .
The activators consisted of ZEBRA or portions of ZEBRA that were fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 ( aa 1 to 147 ) in the plasmid pMA424 ( 30 ) .
AH ( amphipathic helix ) is an artificial activator we used to compare the relative potencies of the ZEBRA-derived activators ( 14 ) .
Stimulation is the ratio of B-galactosidase units measured in yeast cells carrying an activator to the background level on 3GAL/CZ or Z3/CZ induced by GAL4 ( 1-147 ) alone .
This background level was 24 units on 3GAL/CZ and 10 units on Z3/CZ .
( B ) Activation by GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -ZEBRA fusions in the GAL11P strain .
Each plasmid containing a fusion between GAL4 ( 1-147 ) and ZEBRA , or portions of ZEBRA , was transformed into strain P56 : :171 , which carries an integrated reporter consisting of UASq upstream of lacZ ( 18 , 51 ) .
The stimulation index represents the ratio of B-galactosidase activity measured with the GAL4-ZEBRA fusion to the background level of B-galactosidase activity measured following transfection of a plasmid containing GAL4 ( 1-147 ) with no added activating domain .
This value , 4 units , is indicated by a vertical line .
The data are from a representative experiment .
Similar results were obtained in six replicate experiments .
the ZEBRA DNA binding domain , they were only active when measured on GAL4 binding sites .
Weak activation , about fivefold above background level , was also observed when the C-terminal 18 aa were fused to GALA .
No activation was seen when Z ( 51-103 ) or Z ( 1-227 ) was fused to GAL4 .
None of the constructs containing subregions of ZEBRA were toxic in S. cerevisiae .
The results with the GAL4-ZEBRA fusions were consistent with the analysis with deletion mutants .
The N-terminal 93 aa constituted a moderately strong autonomous activating region Vor .

Activation by GAL4-ZEBRA fusions in a potentiator yeast strain .
Because ZEBRA is a weak activator in S. cerevisiae , the intact protein and subdomains of ZEBRA fused to the DNA binding domain of GALA were tested for their capacity to activate transcription in a yeast strain containing a mutant GAL11 allele that converts weak activating regions fused to GAL4 ( 1-147 ) into strong activating regions ( 18 ) .
This mutant GAL11 allele is called GAL11P ( potentiator ) .
The purpose of these experiments was to define subregions of the N-terminal domain of ZEBRA which might contribute to the activating response .
None of these subregions was an activator when fused to GAL4 and expressed in wild-type yeast strains or in yeast strains in which GAL11 was deleted ( Fig .
3A and data not shown ) .
To alleviate toxicity due to overexpression , and thereby to increase the sensitivity of the assay for activation domains of ZEBRA , the level of expression of the chimeric proteins was decreased in the GALIIP strain .
Thus the GALA4-ZEBRA fusions were placed downstream of the GAL4 promoter , which is less powerful than the promoter , in plasmids with low-copy-number ARS-CEN origins of replication .
The reporter , containing a UAS , , bearing four GAL4 binding sites fused to lacZ , was inserted into the chromosome of the GAL11P yeast strain ( 18 ) .
The potency of GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-245 ) increased dramatically in the GAL1IP yeast strain .
When isogenic yeast strains with and without the potentiator mutation were compared , the intact ZEBRA protein fused to GALA was about 100-fold more active in the potentiator strain ( data not shown ) .
Figure 3B shows that two constructs which contained the entire N-terminal activating domain , namely , GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-198 ) and GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-93 ) , both behaved as potent activators in the GAL1MIP strain .
Of various subfragments of the N-terminal region , Z ( 51-103 ) was the most active ; however , it was not as active as the intact protein or fusions containing the entire N-terminal region .
Activation by the carboxy terminus of ZEBRA , aa 228 to 245 , increased about 10-fold when assessed in the potentiator strain compared with wild-type S. cerevisiae .
Although the N-terminal 25 aa were shown to be important in progressive amino-terminal deletion analysis ( Fig .
2A ) , they did not constitute an autonomous activation domain when fused to GALA4 ( 1-147 ) and tested in the GAL1IP strain ( Fig .
3B ) .
Activation by ZEBRA and its deletion mutants in human B cells .
In human B cells , a major activation domain was contained in the amino-terminal 76 aa ( Fig .
4 ) .
There was progressive loss of activity as this region was truncated : deletion of the N-terminal 25 aa reduced activity by 40 % ; deletion of the N-terminal 50 aa reduced activity by more than 90 % .
Z ( 77-245 ) , Z ( 99-245 ) , and Z ( 131-245 ) were inactive in B cells .
All of the N-terminal-deletion mutants were expressed in mammalian cells to similar extents ( data not shown ) .
The progressive decrease in activity associated with the N-terminal deletions suggested that aa 26 to 50 were critical for activation in B cells .
Their importance was also evident from the behavior of internal-deletion mutants .
The removal of these amino acids , as in the mutants Z ( 1-25 , 89-245 ) and Z ( 1-25 , 141-245 ) , markedly reduced activity ; the larger internal deletion caused a greater loss of activity than the smaller one .
Deletion of the C-terminal 18 aa reduced activity in B cells by 60 to 80 % in various experiments .
In related experiments , GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-93 ) and GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 228-245 ) were each found to function as an activator in human B-cell lines when tested on reporters containing five oligomerized GAL4 binding sites upstream of CAT ( data not FUNCTIONS OF ZEBRA REGIONS IN YEAST AND B CELLS 7477 ZEBRA Amino Acids Stimulation index % WT 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 0 50 100 150 200 r -- -r -r -- a -a r r r Z ( 2-245 ) 2 ( 25-245 ) 2 ( 51-245 ) Z ( 77-245 ) z ( 99-245 ) Z ( 131-245 ) Z ( 1-245 ) 2 ( 1-25,89-245 ) |-Z ( 1-25,141-245 ) | 2 ( 1-227 ) Reporter : 23 E4CAT FIG .

Activation of transcription by ZEBRA and ZEBRA deletion mutants in human B cells .
BJAB cells were electroporated with 10 pg of an activator plasmid and 10 pg of a reporter plasmid .
The activators consisted of a nested set of N-terminal-deletion mutants of ZEBRA cloned behind the simian virus 40 promoter in the vector pBXG1 or of wild-type ZEBRA and ZEBRA internal-deletion mutants cloned behind the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter in the plasmid pHD1013 .
The double horizontal line indicates that these mutants were in different vectors and contained different translation initiation sequences .
The reporter , Z3E4CAT , contains three oligomerized ZIIIB sites upstream of a minimal adenovirus E4 promoter fused to CAT ( 4 ) .
Cell extracts prepared 48 h after electroporation were assayed for CAT activity .
Shown are pooled data from duplicate experiments .
The stimulation of transcription by pBXG1/Z ( 2-245 ) , 190-fold , is considered 100 % in the N-terminal-deletion series .
The stimulation of transcription by pHD1013/Z ( 1-245 ) , 70-fold , is considered 100 % for the internal-deletion series .
shown ) .
Thus , the two regions of ZEBRA shown to contain important activating sequences by deletion analysis were also autonomous activating sequences when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain .
Comparing behaviors of deletion mutants in B cells and in S. cerevisiae .
Figure 5 compares activities of the mutants on reporters with three oligomerized ZIIIB sites .
In both B cells and S. cerevisiae , the extreme N terminus was important for activity ; deletion of aa 1 to 25 had similar effects in the two types of cells , about a 40- to 50 % loss of activity .
In Fig .
5 , this region is designated YI and BI for yeast cells and B cells , respectively .
Moreover , the remaining N-terminal 98 aa were required for activity in both yeast and B cells , since the mutant Z ( 99-245 ) was inactive in both types of cells .
Progressive N-terminal and internal deletions implicated aa 26 to 50 , a region designated BI , as being crucial in B cells .
This region could be removed without altering activity in S. cerevisice .
Progressive N-terminal deletions implicated aa 50 to 98 , a region called YII , as important in S. cerevisiae .
Furthermore , as shown in Fig .
3B , YII could function as an autonomous activating region in S. cerevisiae when fused to GALA .
This region also served a function in B cells , since the mutant Z ( 51-245 ) was still active while Z ( 77-245 ) was inactive .
Deletion of the carboxy-terminal 18 aa of ZEBRA , a region called BIV and YIII in B cells and S. cerevisiae , respectively , led to marked reduction in activity in both systems .
DISCUSSION Regions of ZEBRA that participate in activation in S. cerevisiae .
Three regions of ZEBRA protein affect the capacity of the protein to activate transcription in S. cerevisiae .
None of the regions is required for DNA binding in vitro ( 36 , 47 ) .
Deletion of region YI , containing the N-terminal 25 aa , reduced the capacity of ZEBRA to activate transcription by 7478 MILLER ET AL .

Comparison of ZEBRA activating regions which function in S. cerevisiae and in B cells .
( A ) Data for deletion mutants .
A series of deletion mutants were tested for activity in S. cerevisiae ( Fig .
2 ) and in human B cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
The relative stimulation is derived from the data shown in the above-mentioned two figures .
For the N-terminal-deletion series , the activity of construct Z ( 2-245 ) is considered 100 % .
For the internal and carboxy-terminal deletions , the activity of an intact BZLFIL cDNA is considered 100 % .
( B ) ZEBRA activating regions in S. cerevisiae and B cells .
In the column headed `` Required , '' + signifies > 40 % reduction upon deletion .
Region YII is required only if region YI or YIII is not present .
Under the column headed `` Functions , '' + signifies that transcription is stimulated in the potentiator yeast strain ( Fig .
3B ) .
Under the column headed `` Charge , '' the number is the net charge of the region .
Under columns P and Q are the number of prolines and glutamines , respectively , divided by the number of residues in the region .
more than 40 % ; however , this region did not serve as an autonomous activating domain when fused to GAL4 ( 1-147 ) .
Region YI may play an accessory function in activation , either through interaction with other activation domains of ZEBRA or by contacting cellular proteins .
It may also affect protein folding .
Region YII , aa 51 to 102 , was also shown to be important in S. cerevisiae through analysis of progressive N-terminal deletions ( Fig .
2A ) .
Furthermore , YII functioned as an autonomous activation domain when fused to GAL4 ( 1-147 ) and assayed in the GAL IP strain ( Fig .
3B ) .
Deletion of region YIII , residues 228 to 245 , caused the greatest reduction in activation ( Fig .
2B ) .
Substitution of region YIII with VP16 , as in the mutant Z ( 1-227 ) -VP16 , created an activator that was many times more powerful than wild-type ZEBRA .
Since the activation domain of VP16 itself does not bind DNA , this finding suggests that removal of the C-terminal 18 aa from ZEBRA did not significantly affect DNA binding in vivo .
The J. Viro .
mutant Z ( 1-227 ) binds DNA in vitro to an extent comparable to DNA binding by wild-type ZEBRA ( 36 , 47 ) .
However , certain ZEBRA mutants with deletions in the carboxy-terminal 18 aa are deficient in binding DNA in vitro under conditions of high salt concentration or low temperature ( 36 , 47 ) .
Therefore we can not exclude a contribution of this region to DNA binding in vivo .
Nonetheless , region YIII was an autonomous activator when fused to GAL4 ( 1-147 ) and assayed in the GALIIP strain ( Fig .
3B ) .
One model to account for the results of deletional mutagenesis is to consider these three regions of ZEBRA as dependent activating sequences , each of which requires the presence of another activating region .
When only one of the three regions is retained , the mutant is inactive .
Thus , mutant Z ( 99-245 ) , which has regions YI and YII deleted , and mutant Z ( 1-25 , 141-227 ) , which has regions YII and YIII deleted , are both unable to activate transcription ( Fig .
2 ) .
When two of the three regions are present , the mutant exhibits a reduced level of activity .
Thus , the mutant with only region YI deleted , Z ( 26-245 ) , would be considered to activate as a result of regions YII and YI .
The mutant with region YI deleted , Z ( 1-25 , 89-245 ) , activates as the result of YI and YIII , and the mutant with region YIH deleted , Z ( 1-227 ) , activates through the activity of YI and YII .
The residual activity of each functional deletion mutant can be accounted for by a hierarchy of importance of each set of activating sequences : YIII > YI > YII .
The least active deletion mutant contains YI and YII .
The most active deletion mutant contains YIII and YI ( Fig .
2B and 5B ) .
The GAL4-ZEBRA fusions were consistent with the idea that two groups of activating sequences were required for ZEBRA to activate transcription in S. cerevisiae .
A chimeric mutant containing regions YI and YII , GAL4 ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-93 ) , functioned as an activator in wild-type yeast strains .
However , neither region YI nor YI alone functioned as an activating sequence when fused to GAL4 and assayed in wild-type S. cerevisiae .
Nonetheless , region YII was functional when fused to GAL4 ( 1-147 ) and expressed in GALIIP yeast cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
In this yeast strain , GAL4 ( 1-147 ) by itself behaves as a weak activator ( 18 ) .
It is possible that the activity of ZEBRA YII was revealed in the GAL1IP strain through synergy with the cryptic activating sequences in GALA ( 1-147 ) .
Whatever the mechanism of action of the GAL1IP mutation , it serves as a useful tool for the detection of weak activation domains by increasing their capacity to activate transcription .
A paradoxical result was that the chimeric protein GALA ( 1-147 ) -Z ( 1-227 ) , which contains ZEBRA regions YI and YII , did not activate either in wild-type or potentiator yeast strains .
While this result may be explained by a problem in protein folding , another interpretation is that an internal portion of the ZEBRA protein may exert an inhibitory effect on transcriptional activation .
Inhibitory sequences in the central region of the GAL4 protein have recently been characterized ( 44 , 46 ) .
GALA , like ZEBRA , has activation domains at the amino and carboxy termini , separated by a large internal domain which contains the inhibitory region .
What is the nature of these dependent activation domains ?
They are all weakly acidic ; perhaps the accumulation of net negative charge turns the whole protein into an activator ( 12 , 37 ) .
However , the hypothesis that negative charge by itself is a major determinant of activation potency seems unlikely , since deletion of YIII , with a charge of -2 , has a major effect on activation potency but deletion of YII , with a charge of -3 , has little or no effect ( Fig .
5B ) .
Regions YI and YII are both relatively proline rich ( 16 % ) .
YII is moderately glutamine rich ( 11 % ) ( Fig .
5B ) .
Region YIII contains a consensus site for cdc2 kinase , suggesting , perhaps , that phosphorylation , and the Vor .
67 , 1993 resulting increase in net negative charge , may contribute to ZEBRA 's capacity to behave as an activator .
Point mutagenesis is needed to define the requirements for these different motifs in transcriptional activation ( 20 ) .
Parallels in activating behavior of ZEBRA in S. cerevisiae and in human B cells .
In S. cerevisice and in human B cells , ZEBRA behaves as a sequence-specific activator of transcrip-tion ; it activates transcription of reporter genes bearing ZREs , and it does not activate reporter genes lacking such elements or those containing binding sites for another EBV regulatory protein , such as EBNA-1 .
The genes responsive to ZEBRA 's action in S. cerevisiae may bear synthetic promoters with oligomerized ZREs , or they may contain natural promoters of viral genes , such as BMRF-1 and BZLF1 , which are activated by ZEBRA as it switches latent EBV to lytic replication in human B cells ( 6a ) .
ZEBRA 's action is through direct contact with DNA , both in S. cerevisiae and in human B cells .
ZEBRA mutants , such as Z ( M178-180 ) , which do not bind DNA fail to activate synthetic promoters ( Fig .
2B ) and certain natural promoters , such as BMRF-1 , in S. cerevisiae and in B cells ( data not shown ) .
In fact , transcriptional activation of oligomerized ZIIIB sites in S. cerevisiae in the presence of the DNA binding mutants is lower than background level ( Fig .
2B ) .
These mutants might lead to less-than-background-level activation through formation of heterodimers with endogenous yeast proteins which bind ZIIIB sites .
This might prevent the yeast proteins from binding DNA or activating transcription , or both .
ZEBRA is a weak activator in S. cerevisiae , as it is in human B cells .
In S. cerevisiae , the activation potency of ZEBRA is about one-fifth that of GAL4 region II , the strong carboxy-terminal activating domain of GAL4 ( data not shown ) .
Fusion of the powerful activation domain of herpes simplex virus VP16 to ZEBRA increases its activation potency 6- to 20-fold in human B cells and about S5-fold in S. cerevisiae ( 1 ) .
As is particularly characteristic of weak activators , transcriptional activity by ZEBRA is synergistic .
Model promoters with a single binding site are activated poorly in human B cells and in S. cerevisiae .
Promoters with two or more binding sites are activated strongly in both systems .
The same magnitude of synergy is observed in vivo in human B cells , in vitro in a HeLa cell extract , and in S. cerevisiqe ( 4 ) .
Conservation of ZEBRA 's activating regions in S. cerevisiae and in human B cells .
The overall functional architecture of ZEBRA protein is preserved in S. cerevisice and in human B cells .
A complex activation domain consisting of several subregions is contained in the N-terminal 98 aa ; deletion of this entire region severely impairs activation both in S. cerevisiae and in mammalian cells ( Fig .
2A and 4 ) ( 11 , 15 , 36 ) .
This region represents an autonomous domain sufficient to activate transcription when fused to GAL4 and expressed in S. cerevisiae ot in mammalian cells ( Fig .
3 ) ( reference 11 and data not shown ) .
Furthermore , we show here for the first time that the carboxy-terminal 18 aa contribute to ZEBRA 's ability to behave as an activator in EBV-negative B cells and in S. cerevisiae and also constitute an autonomous activating region .
Experiments that examine the capacity of activators to work in heterologous systems have led to the hypothesis that some activators are `` universal '' and others are `` specialized '' ( 38 ) .
Universal activators , such as the acidic C-terminal 80 aa of the powerful herpes simplex virus activator VP16 or the C-terminal 114 aa of the S. cerevisiae activator GALA , operate in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells , including those of yeasts , insects , and mammals ( 2 , 6 , 23 , 40 ) .
Furthermore , some point mutations of GALA increase or decrease its activation potency in the same direction in both yeast and mammalian cells ( 12 ) .
FUNCTIONS OF ZEBRA REGIONS IN YEAST AND B CELLS 7479 Specialized activators , such as the glutamine-rich domain of the Sp-1 transcription factor , work in mammalian cells but not in yeast cells ( 13 ) .
Universal activators are thought to contact some component of the transcription machinery which is highly conserved through evolution ( 13 , 17 ) .
In the sense that a universal activator can function in both yeast and mammalian cells , ZEBRA fits the definition .
However , certain mutants with deletions in ZEBRA\ 's N-terminal activating region behaved in a discordant fashion in S. cerevisiae and in human B cells .
For example , removal of the N-terminal 50 aa reduced ZEBRA 's activity to 7 % of the wild-type level in B cells but only to 48 % of the wild-type level in S. cerevisiae .
Moreover , in the progressive N-terminal-deletion series , removal of ZEBRA aa 26 to 50 caused a major reduction of activity in B cells but had no effect in 8. cerevisiae .
Furthermore , the internal deletion of aa 26 to 88 caused only minimal loss of activity in S. cerevisiae and profound diminution in B cells .
These results indicate that a region containing aa 26 to 50 is an essential component of ZEBRA 's activating domain in human B cells but not in S. cerevisiae .
Others have also implicated this region as important for activation by ZEBRA in other mammalian cells such as HeLa and EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cells ( 11 , 15 ) .
In related work , two of us ( T.C .
and M.C . )
have found that aa 26 to 51 function as an autonomous activating domain when fused to GAL4 ( 1-147 ) and assayed in mammalian epithelial ( Cos-1 ) cells .
The question is whether those mutations which have a greater effect on the activity of ZEBRA in mammalian cells than in yeast disqualify the protein as a universal activator .
One possible cellular target for ZEBRA 's action is the TATA-binding protein , TBP ( 35 ) .
The carboxy-terminal 180 aa of this protein are highly conserved through evolution ( 3 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 35 ) .
It has been shown that ZEBRA can interact directly with TBP and that amino acids in ZEBRA 's N-terminal region are required for this interaction ( 27 ) .
A likely hypothesis is that some of these amino acids also interact with yeast TBP and account for ZEBRA 's universal behavior .
Those amino acids of ZEBRA which are required in mammalian cells but not in S. cerevisiae may reflect interactions between ZEBRA and nonconserved regions in the amino terminus of TBP which are specific for mammalian cells or interactions between ZEBRA and other proteins , such as TBP -associated factors , which are not thought to be conserved in evolution ( 39 ) .
Thus , ZEBRA has attributes of both a universal and a specialized activator .
