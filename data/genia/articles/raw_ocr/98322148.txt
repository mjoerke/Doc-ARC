Role of GATA-1 in Proliferation and Differentiation of Definitive Erythroid and Megakaryocytic Cells In Vivo By Satoru Takahashi , Takuya Komeno , Naruyoshi abe , Keigyo Yoh , Osamu Nakajima , Sigeko Nishimura , Takashi Kuroha , Toshiro Nagasawa , and Masayuki Yamamoto To elucidate the contributions of GATA-1 to definitive hematopoiesis in vivo , we have examined adult mice that were rendered genetically defective in GATA-1 synthesis ( Takaha-shi et al , J Biol Chem 272:12611 , 1997 ) .
Because the GATA-1 gene is located on the X chromosome , which is randomly inactivated in every cell , heterozygous females can bear either an active wild-type or mutant ( referred to as GATA-1.05 ) GATA-1 allele , consequently leading to variable anemic severity .
These heterozygous mutant mice usually developed normally , but they began to die after 5 months .
These affected animals displayed marked splenomegaly , anemia , and thrombocytopenia .
Proerythroblasts and megakaryocytes massively accumulated in the spleens of the heterozy-gotes , and we showed that the neomycin resistance gene ( which is the positive selection marker in ES cells ) was RANSCRIPTION FACTOR GATA-1 is expressed within the hematopoietic hierarchy in erythroid , megakaryo- cytic , eosinophilic , and mast cell lineages ! ''
as well as in Sertoli cells of the testis . ''
The GATA-1 gene has been mapped to the X chromosome '' and two alternative promoters/first exons with differential tissue-specific usage have been identified .
The 5 ' IT promoter and the downstream IE promoter dictate GATA-1 transcription in Sertoli cells and erythroid cells , respectively .
The functional roles of GATA-1 in hematopoietic cell development have been analyzed by gene targeting ( reviewed in Yamamoto et al '' ) .
Analysis of chimeric animals generated by GATA-1-null embryonic stem ( ES ) cells indicated that the mutant cells do not contribute to the mature erythroid popula-tion. ! ''
In vitro , GATA-l-null ES cells are also unable to differentiate into mature erythroid cells , '' '' thus suggesting that GATA-1 is required for the terminal differentiation of committed erythroid progenitor cells .
Because previous attempts at generating germ line GATA-1-null alleles were unsuccessful , ! ''
we prepared an erythroid promoter-specific knock-down of the GATA-1 gene .
'* Because male embryos bearing this mutation expressed GATA-1 mRNAs at approximately 5 % of the level that accumulated in wild-type embryos , we therefore referred to this mutant allele as GATA From the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for TARA and the Division of Hematology , Institute of Clinical Medicine , University of Tsukuba , Tsukuba , Japan Submitted October 16 , 1997 ; accepted March 6 , 1998 .

0006-4971/98/9202-0024 $ 3.00/0 434 expressed profusely in the abnormally abundant cells generated in the GATA-1.05 mutant females .
We also observed hematopoiesis outside of the bone marrow in the affected mutant mice .
These data suggest that a small number of GATA-1.05 mutant hematopoietic progenitor cells begin to proliferate vigorously during early adulthood , but because the cells are unable to terminally differentiate , this leads to progenitor proliferation in the spleen and consequently death .
Thus , GATA-1 plays important in vivo roles for directing definitive hematopoietic progenitors to differentiate along both the erythroid and megakaryocytic pathways .
The GATA-1 heterozygous mutant mouse shows a phenotype that is analogous to human myelodysplastic syndrome and thus may serve as a useful model for this disorder .

1.05 .
All mutant male embryos ( of GATA-1.057Y genotype ) died by 12.5 days post coitus ( dpc ) due to impaired primitive hematopoiesis .
Analysis of the male embryos ( by specifically marking primitive progenitors with a lacZ transgene ) demonstrated that the maturation of these progenitors was blocked at the proerythroblast stage in the GATA-1.05/Y embryos , indicating that GATA-1 is necessary for terminal differentiation during primitive erythropoiesis . ''
This conclusion is consistent with that of another recent analysis studying GATA-1-null mutant embryonic erythropoiesis . ''
However , the in vivo functional contributions of GATA-1 to definitive hematopoiesis are still unknown , because mutant male mice ( GATA-1.05/Y ) die before full commencement of definitive hematopoiesis due to a severe deficit in primitive hematopoiesis .
To address this question , we took advantage of the fact that GATA-1 gene is X-linked , '' and because of random inactivation of the X chromosome ( ie , Lyonization ' '' ) in somatic tissues , heterozygous mutant females should always be chimeric for GATA-1 gene expression .
Analysis of heterozygous ( GATA-1.05/X ) female mice showed that GATA-1 is required for the terminal differentiation of definitive erythroid and megakaryocytic cells .
These results indicate that GATA-1 is a key regulator of definitive hematopoietic cell differentiation in vivo and suggest that the loss of GATA-1 is an accelerating factor for abnormal expansion of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage progenitor cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice .
Mice bearing the GATA-1.05 allele '' were bred in clean rooms at the Animal Research Institute of Tohoku University and in the Animal Research Center at the University of Tsukuba ( Tsukuba , Japan ) .
Hematological examination of mice heterozygous for the GATA-1.05 allele was performed by phlebotomy from the retro-orbital plexus .
After initially noting that adult heterozygous mutant female mice have abnormally shorter life spans , they were monitored carefully after becoming anemic so that necropsies could be performed within 12 hours after death .
Biopsy of overtly healthy GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant females was performed on a group of 11 young mice of 8 to 12 weeks of age .
Histological analysis of mice .
Samples of major organs of the GATA-1.05 heterozygous mice and their littermates were obtained Blood , Vol 92 , No 2 ( July 15 ) , 1998 : pp 434-442 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination .
Cryo-sections were processed for immunohistochemistry with N6 anti-GATA-1 antibody© and antimouse glycoprotein IIb antibody ( Komeno et al , submitted for publication ) .
Acetylcholinesterase staining for megakaryocytes was performed as described . ''

- RNA was isolated from spleens using the guanidine thiocyanate/cesium chloride ultracen-trifugation method . '' ''
First-strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript reverse-transcriptase ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) at 37°C for 1 hour , and 1 uL of this 20 uL reaction mixture was used for the PCR reactions .
Amplified products were analyzed on 2 % agarose gels .
Sequences of the primers used were as follows : erythroid-specific GATA-1 transcript ( expected size , 483 bp ) , 5-TAAGGTGGCT-GAATCCTCTGCATC and 3'-CCGTCTTCAAGGTGTCCAAGAA-CGT ; testis-specific GATA-1 transcript ( expected size , 529 bp ) , 5'-CGTGAAGCGAGACCATCGTC and the 3'-primer was the same as the erythroid 3'-primer ; and neomycin phosphotransferase ( expected product , 339 bp ) , 5'-AAGTATCCATCATGGCTGATG and 3'-TAGC-CAACGCTATGTCCTGATA .
Primers for glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-genase ( G6PD ; expected size , 162 bp ) were synthesized as described previously. ! ''
RESULTS Female mice of GATA-1.05/X genotype have a shortened life span .
- We have previously reported that GATA-1.05/X mutant female mice suffered varying degrees of anemia in the embryonic and early neonatal stages .
'* Because the wild-type siblings displayed none of these symptoms , we suspected that this heterogeneity in phenotype was probably due to variable extent of random inactivation of the wild-type X chromosome . ''
We therefore selected 19 heterozygous and 8 wild-type female mice and followed their life span .
The GATA-1.05/X mice had a shortened life span in comparison to wild-type littermates .
More than half of the heterozygous mutant female mice died within 7 months after birth ( Fig 1 ) , whereas all 8 control female animals survived beyond the test period .
Thus , the GATA-1.05 lesion leads to a dramatically foreshortened life span in mature heterozygous females .
Anemia and thrombocytopenia in adult GATA-1.05 female mutant mice .
- To elucidate the cause of death in the heterozygous mutant mice , we dissected and analyzed the moribund animals .
We found that most of them displayed marked splenomegaly ( varying principally in degree ) and that the appearance of the enlarged spleen was light red to pink in color , rather than the typical dark red color ( Fig 2A ) .
Furthermore , expansion of the spleen was so pronounced that other abdominal organs were compressed , as is also often seen in human myeloproliferative disorders .
Eight litters from GATA-1.05 mutant female and wild-type male mice crosses either by biopsy or autopsy soon after death were examined .
We found that all of the mice that died spontaneously were of the GATA-1.05/X genotype and that most of these showed enlargement of the spleen to variable degrees ( Fig 2B , +/- a ) .
A second group of 11 8- to 12-week-old female mutant mice were killed , and their spleens were examined by biopsy .
These mice were considerably younger than the previous set of mutant females examined that had died spontaneously .

spleen among these overtly healthy young mice ( Fig 2B , +/-b ) .
There was a strong correlation between the degree of anemia and splenomegaly , in that mice with the most severe anemia showed the most marked splenomegaly ( see below ) .
We next analyzed peripheral blood taken from 14 GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant mice as well as 6 wild-type female litter mates .
The mutant mice displayed varying degrees of anemia and thrombocytopenia ( Table 1 ) .
Whereas the severity of anemia varied enormously among heterozygous mutant ani-mals , the platelet counts were consistently lower in the GATA-1.05 heterozygous mice than in wild-type litter mates ( Table 1 ) .
Upon necropsy , mice with the lowest hematocrits ( hematocrit , 25 ) uniformly displayed the most pronounced splenomegaly ( Fig 2B ) .
These data suggest that the cause of death in GATA-1.05 heterozygous mice is probably due to the anemia and splenomegaly .
Massive accumulation of proerythroblasts and megakaryocytes in the spleens of heterozygous mutant mice .
| Histological examination of the grossly enlarged spleen ( of sample no .
12 in Table 1 ) showed that the architecture of the spleen was severely affected ( Fig 3A ; compare C and E ) .
Importantly , proerythroblasts had massively infiltrated the spleen ( Fig 3B ) .
Because of proerythroblasts accumulation , there was almost no white pulp and only residual visible red pulp ( see arrows ) .
Because the accumulating erythroid cells are immature , whereas in human myeloproliferative disorders the number of mature cells are aberrantly high , these two disorders are different in this respect .
In one of the slightly enlarged spleens ( from heterozygote no .
3 in Table 1 ) , the overall architecture of the spleen was generally preserved , but the mass of red pulp was less prominent ( Fig 3C ) than that in the wild-type spleen ( Fig 3B ) .
Furthermore , the residual red pulp was filled with proerythroblasts ( Fig 3D ) .
The megakaryocyte count was also significantly higher ( Fig 3D and Table 1 ) when compared with the number in From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

that the megakaryocytes in the spleens of GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutants had progressed quite far in megakaryopoiesis , the terminal steps leading to platelet formation still seem to be impaired in these cells .
GATA-I-negative , neomycin phosphotransferase-positive cells accumulate in the spleens of GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant mice .
- To determine the origin of the cells that accumulate in the spleens of GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant mice , we performed immunostaining with an anti-GATA-1 antibody on spleen sections of the mutant and wild-type mice .
As shown in Fig 5A , numerous cells in the red pulp of a wild-type spleen were stained brown by the anti-GATA-1 antibody ; proerythro- TAKAHASHI ET AL blasts and megakaryocytes were shown to express abundant GATA-1 ( Fig 5B ) .
In contrast , both the red pulp and white pulp were virtually nonexistent in the enlarged spleen of the heterozygous mutant mouse ( Fig 5C ) .
The proerythroblasts and megakaryocytes that had accumulated in these enlarged spleens did not immunoreact with the anti-GATA-1 antibody ( Fig 5C ) ; however , a few GATA-1-positive erythroid cells were observed in these same sections in remnants of the red pulp ( Fig 5D ) .
These results suggested that the erythroid and megakaryocytic cells that have proliferated and accumulated in the grossly enlarged mutant spleens are derived from parental cells containing an inactivated GATA-1 allele .
To test this hypothesis , the transcription level of neomycin phosphotransferase ( Neo ) gene as well as GATA-1 gene , initiating from both testis and erythroid-specific promoters , were examined by RT-PCR analysis .
Because the Neo gene was knocked-in to the GATA-1 locus , we predicted that the presence of Neo mRNA should be detectable in cells in which the GATA-1.05 allele is active , even in the absence of Neo selection .
The analysis shown in Fig 6 verified this hypothesis and showed that the level of Neo gene expression increased significantly in the GATA-1.05 heterozygous mouse spleens .
The Neo expression level correlates well with the severity of splenomegaly and bears an inverse relationship to the expression of GATA-1 from the erythroid ( IE ) first exon ( E-GATA-1 , Fig 6 ) .
Interestingly , there is a reciprocal increase in GATA-1 expression from the IT exon ( Fig 6 , T-GATA-1 ) .
These data further support the conclusion that the mutant GATA-1 allele is active in the cells that accumulate in the enlarged spleens of the GATA-1.05 mutant animals .
Ectopic liver hematopoiesis in adult GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant mice .
| The data presented thus far have shown that the cells that proliferate and accumulate in the spleens of GATA-1.05 mutant animals are hematopoietic cells and that they are deficient in GATA-1 synthesis .
Erythroid differentiation in the GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant cells bearing an active GATA-1.05 allele ( and an inactive wild-type allele ) is arrested at the proerythroblast stage .
These data imply that the GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant may serve as a mouse model for the human disorder , myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) .
MDS is characterized ( among other hallmarks ) by abnormal accumulation of immature cells in the enlarged spleens of affected individuals , as well as ectopic hematopoiesis .
The notion that the GATA-1.05 mutant mice might be a good model for the human MDS is further supported by the observation that the heterozygous mutant adult mice that display marked splenomegaly also have ectopic hematopoiesis in the liver , where we found erythroblast-like cells as well as megakaryocytes in the hepatic sinuses ( Fig 7A and B ) .
Some hepatocytes were also found to be compressed simply by accumulated hematopoietic cells .
In the spleen sections from some heterozygous mutant mice that were found dead , mitotic figures were also often observed ( Fig 7C ) .
In addition , high numbers of proerythroblasts were found in the peripheral blood of mice with severe anemia ( Fig 7D ) .
These observations suggest that the accumulation of GATA-1-deficient cells leads to a preleukemic state and , therefore , that this mutation has the potential to serve as a useful animal model for human MDS .

DISCUSSION In this study , we have analyzed the functional contributions of GATA-1 to the growth and differentiation processes of definitive hematopoietic cells in heterozygous GATA-1 knock-down mutant mice .
We took advantage of the facts that the murine GATA-1 gene is localized on the X chromosome and that one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated randomly in heterozygous females .
The loss of GATA-1 function in this mutant resulted in the stimulation of growth and the arrest of the differentiation in hematopoietic cells , which became manifest as severe anemia , thrombocytopenia , and splenomegaly , thus resulting in a foreshortened life span .
The data demonstrate that GATA-1 is necessary for the terminal differentiation of definitive erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage cells in vivo .
GATA-1 has long been thought , and more recently demon-strated , to be a key regulator of erythroid lineage maturation .
For instance , we and others recently demonstrated that maturation of primitive erythroid cells is arrested at the proerythroblast stage .
'* '' '' Compared with the unequivocal proof supporting the role of GATA-1 in primitive hematopoiesis , the evidence of GATA-1 in definitive hematopoiesis has been quite limited .
In this regard , Fujiwara et al '' '' recently reported that the majority of mice heterozygous for a GATA-1-null allele are born anemic , but they recover during the neonatal period .
They speculated that this recovery is presumably due to in vivo selection of progenitor clones with an active normal allele .
We have observed the same phenomenon in mice bearing the knock-down GATA-1.05 allele ( data not shown ) .
In addition , we report here that mice heterozygous for the GATA-1.05 allele have a significantly shorter life span and splenomegaly .
The observation of late onset splenomegaly in the GATA-1.05 heterozygous mutant mice was an intriguing surprise .
We demonstrated that the cells that had proliferated and accumulated in these mutant animals are of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
The proliferative cell population was shown to contain an active GATA-1.05 allele ( and an inactive wild-type allele ) and undetectable amounts of GATA-1 protein .
In summary , these data indicated that , in the absence of GATA-1 , hematopoietic progenitors either have , or gradually acquire , a growth advantage over their normal counterparts some time during postnatal development .

ROLE OF GATA-1 IN DEFINITIVE HEMATOPOIESIS Forced expression of GATA-1 protein in avian erythroid progenitor cells was reported to accelerate erythroid cell differentiation with concomitant suppression of proliferation , '' '' whereas constitutive expression of GATA-1 was reported to interfere with normal cell-cycle progression . ''
These reports and our present data lead us to hypothesize that the lack of GATA-1 stimulates proliferation and suppresses differentiation in hematopoietic cells .
In this regard , an in vitro ES cell differentiation system developed by Nakano et al '' '' may serve as an additional useful experimental tool for detailed assessment of the erythroid differentiation process .
Our preliminary analysis of GATA-1.05/Y¥ ES cells ' using this method has showed that the GATA-1.05 mutation directly affects the growth rate of proerythroblasts and megakaryocytes ( Suwabe et al , submitted for publication ) .
Because the only resident feedback mechanism that exists in the in vitro ES cell differentiation system is provided by the support cells , which may represent the bone marrow stroma environment ( see below ) , these data further support the hypothesis that GATA-1 acts simultaneously to stimulate hematopoietic cell differentiation and to suppress proliferation .
In contrast to our present finding , Weiss et al ' ?
reported that GATA-1~ proerythroblasts simply apoptosed in vitro .
We think that this may be accounted for by the difference in in vivo and in vitro experimental systems .
A similar discrepancy has been seen previously , in that primitive erythrocytes could not be generated from GATA-1-null ES cells under their in vitro differentiation condition .
We and others '' '' have found that primitive erythrocytes are generated , but not terminally differentiated , under the GATA-1 knock-down !
or knock-out condition ' '' in vivo .
Expression of GATA-1 from the IE promoter was found to be significantly diminished in abnormally abundant hematopoietic cells in the spleen of the GATA-1.05 mutant females .
In contrast , GATA-1 expression from the IT promoter concomitantly increased in the anemic mice that displayed splenomegaly .
Moroni et al '' '' recently reported that , when purified hematopoietic progenitors are stimulated by erythropoietin , GATA-1 expression from the IT promoter was upregulated . '' ''
Therefore , the more abundant expression of GATA-1 arising from the IT promoter in the heterozygous mutant mice could be in response to increased levels of erythropoietin in these animals .
The data therefore suggest that the expression of GATA-1 from the IT promoter may be under regulatory feedback control in a homeostatic circuit involving the growth control elicited by erythropoietin .
However , the amount of GATA-1 from the IT promoter is probably below the sensitivity of histochemical detection , because the normal expression level of GATA-1 from the IT promoter in hematopoietic cells is only about 5 % of the total GATA-1 expression in the spleen .
Despite the abnormal accumulation of megakaryocytes in the mutant spleens , a severe and consistent thrombocytopenia was observed in the GATA-1.05 heterozygous female mice .
We therefore concluded that GATA-1 may also be important for the terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes .
Consistent with this observation , Pevny et al '' '' previously reported that GATA-1-negative megakaryocytes were abnormally abundant in chimeric fetal livers , suggesting an alteration in the kinetics of their formation or turnover .
Furthermore , Shivdasani et al '' have recently demonstrated that GATA-1 plays a critical role in 441 megakaryocyte growth regulation and platelet biogenesis in vivo using a lineage-specific knock-out strategy .
All of these results argue that GATA-1 is necessary for terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes .
Megakaryocytes normally express GATA-1 , and several genes expressed specifically in this lineage appear to be under the regulation of GATA-1 or other GATA family transcription factors .
It has been reported that the glycoprotein IIb gene is directly regulated by GATA-1 . ''
However , we detected the glycoprotein IIb protein in megakaryocytes that lack GATA-1 .
This suggests either that GATA-2 , which is coexpressed in this cell lineage , could functionally substitute for GATA-1 or that the low level of GATA-1 present in the GATA-1.05 mutant megakaryocytes may be adequate to execute most , but not all aspects , of megakaryocytic differentiation .
Regardless of the mechanism used , the results presented here clearly indicate that GATA-2 can not fully compensate for GATA-1 function in megakaryopoiesis .
Thus , the identification of bona fide target genes of GATA-1 remains an important hurdle to extending our understanding of the role of GATA-1 in megakaryocyte differentiation .
