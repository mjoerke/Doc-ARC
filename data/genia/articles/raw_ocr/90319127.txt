Putnam , April 23 , 1990 ( received for review February 23 , 1990 ) ABSTRACT The recently discovered macrolide FK506 has been demonstrated to have potent immunosuppressive activity at concentrations 100-fold lower than cyclosporin A , a cyclic undecapeptide that is used to prevent rejection after transplantation of bone marrow and organs , such as kidney , heart , and liver .
After the recent discovery that the cyclosporin A-binding protein cyclophilin is identical to peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase , a cellular binding protein for FK506 was found to be distinct from cyclophilin but to have the same enzymatic activity .
In this study , we isolated a cDNA coding for FK506-binding protein ( FKBP ) from human peripheral blood T cells by using mixed 20-mer oligonucleotide probes synthesized on the basis of the sequence , Glu-Asp-Gly-Lys-Lys-Phe-Asp , reported for bovine FKBP .
The DNA isolated contained an open reading frame encoding 108 amino acid resi-dues .
The first 40 residues of the deduced amino acid sequence were identical to those of the reported amino-terminal sequence of bovine FKBP , indicating that the DNA sequence isolated represents the gene coding for FKBP .
Computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that FKBP exhibits no internal homology and does not have significant sequence similarity to any other amino acid sequences of known proteins , including cyclophilin .
This result suggests that two catalytically similar proteins , cyclophilin and FKBP , evolved independently .
In Northern blot analysis , mRNA species of ~1.8 kilobases that hybridized with human FKBP cDNA were detected in poly ( A ) * RNAs from brain , lung , liver , and placental cells and leukocytes .
Induction of Jurkat leukemic T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin did not affect the level of FKBP mRNA .
Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA digested with different restriction enzymes suggests the existence of only a few copies of the DNA sequence encoding FKBP .
This is in contrast to the result that as many as 20 copies of the cyclophilin gene and possible pseudogenes may be present in the mammalian genome .
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , a cyclic undecapeptide , and the recently discovered FK506 , a macrolide , are powerful immu-nosuppressants ; CsA has been used clinically in the prevention of graft rejection following bone marrow and organ transplantation ( 1 ) .
CsA and FK 506 are chemically distinct , but the effect of the two compounds on immunosuppression appears to be remarkably similar , though FK506 is said to be 100 times more potent than CsA in this regard ( 1 ) .
Although the binding of CsA to calmodulin has been described ( 2 ) , the action of CsA is thought to be mediated through cyclophilin , an abundant cytosolic protein representing most of the CsA-binding activity in nearly all organs and cells ( 3 ) .
Our previous discoveries that cyclophilin is identical to peptidylprolyl The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

5440 cis-trans isomerase ( PPlase ) and that CsA inhibits its activity led to the hypothesis that the action of CsA ( for example , immunosuppressive action in T cells ) is mediated through inhibition of the PPlase activity ( 4 ) .
Recently a cellular binding protein for FK 506 ( FKBP ) was also found to have the same enzymatic activity as cyclophilin .
However , cyclophilin and FKBP are quite distinct in terms of ligand speci-ficity ; cyclophilin binds to , and is inhibited by , CsA but does not recognize FK 506 , whereas the converse holds for FKBP ( 5 , 6 ) .
On the basis of earlier data , which indicated that CsA and FK 506 act on T lymphocytes in an essentially equivalent fashion ( 1 ) , these findings suggest that the two drugs act through distinct pathways but that their mode of action converges on PPlase activities .
FKBP is abundant and is found in Jurkat T cells , bovine thymus , and human spleen ( 5 , 6 ) .
FK506 binds to its protein with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity close to 1 nM .
FKBP exhibits a 15- to 20-fold lower specific PPlase activity than that of cyclophilins toward a synthetic substrate ( 5 ) .
The molecular weight of FKBP reported by two groups is somewhat at variance ( M , = 11,000 and 14,000 ) and differs from that of cyclophilin ( M , of pig cyclophilin = 18,000 ) ( 5 , 6 ) .
However , except for the amino-terminal sequence , which was found to be distinct from that of cyclophilin ( 6 ) , little is known about the chemical structure of FKBP .
In this paper , we report the nucleotide sequence of human FKBP.t MATERIALS AND METHODS Screening and Sequencing of a FKBP cDNA .
A cDNA library ( Agt11 ) of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood T cells was purchased from Clontech .
Escherichia coli strain Y¥1090 was transfected with the library , and a total of 2 x 10° transfectants replica-plated on nylon filters were screened for FKBP cDNA sequences by using a mixture of 20-mer oligonucleotides as a probe .
The oligonucleotide mixture [ 5-GA ( A/G ) GA ( T/C ) GG ( G/A/T/C ) AA ( A/ G ) AA ( A/G ) TT ( T/C ) GA-3 ' , 128 different sequences ] was synthesized based on the sequence , Glu-Asp-Gly-Lys-Lys-Phe-Asp , reported for bovine FKBP ( 6 ) and labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Takara , Kyoto ) and ( Amersham ) as described by Maniatis et al .

In addition , the isoelec-tric point ( pl 8.71 ) of the protein calculated from the deduced sequence is also fairly consistent with the value ( pI 8.8-8.9 ) reported by Harding et al .
( 6 ) .
Furthermore , in order to confirm that the isolated cDNA encodes FKBP , the Nco I fragment of FKBP2 cDNA , which included the entire open reading frame of FKBP , was translated by constructing the expression vector , pJDB207 , under control of the glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter in AH22 yeast cells .
NaDodSO , /PAGE analysis of the protein expressed in yeast cells showed that the molecular weight of FKBP synthesized was in good agreement with that reported by Siekierka et al .
( 10 ) .
These results indicate that the isolated cDNA sequence encodes FKBP .
Structural Features of FKBP .
To investigate the possible occurrence of sequences homologous to FKBP in other proteins , we used the IDEAS program to compare the entire sequence to the Protein Identification Resource , GenBank , and EMBL data bases ( October 1989 ) accessed through the DNA Data Bank of Japan ( DDBJ ; National Institute of Genetics , Center for Genetic Information Research Laboratory of Genetic Information Analysis , Mishima , Sizuoka 411 , Japan ) .
The programs used , IDEAS , COMPARE-DOTPLOT , and cHOFAS , were also provided by the DDBJ .
The amino acid sequence of FKBP was found to be unique in that no protein or any segment gave a significant score for homology .
A graphic matrix plot of the FKBP sequence against itself and against the sequences of cyclophilins/PPlases from mammals ( 4 , 11-13 ) , fly ( 14 ) , fungi ( 15 ) , yeast ( N.M. , N.T. , F.S. , T.H. , M.S. , and K. Watanabe , unpublished data ) , and E. coli ( TH. , N.T. , N.M. , M.S. , and S. Kato , unpublished data ) was prepared by the comMPARE-DOTPLOT program .
This suggested that FKBP does not have internal homology within its own amino acid sequence and does not have sequence similarity to cyclophilins/PPlases including E. coli PPlase , which is not sensitive to CsA ( T.H. , N.T. , N.M. , M.S. , and S. Kato , unpublished data ) .
Despite the enzymatic similarity between FKBP and cyclophilins/PPlases , the highest identity found in their amino acid sequences was only three consecutive residues [ e.g .
, Phe*-Met '' -Leu® ( with yeast and Neurospora crassa cyclophilins/PPlases ) , Ala'*-Thr'* '' -Gly ?
and Gly®-Val '' °-Ala'® ( with E. coli PPlase ) , and ( with pig and bovine cyclophilins/ PPlases ) ] .
In these sequences Phe-Met-Leu was located in one of the two regions that were identified to be highly conserved in the amino acid sequences of cyclophilins/ PPlases across species ( TH. , N.T. , N.M. , M.S. , and S. Kato , unpublished data ) .
However , we do n't know yet whether or not this amino acid sequence is involved in the catalytic sites of the two enzymes .
Thus , we were not able to identify any significant sequence homology between cyclophilin and FKBP even in a short stretch of their amino acid sequences .
Although the £ .
coli PPlase is insensitive to CsA , its amino acid sequence is also related to those of cyclophilins ( T.H. , N.T. , N.M. , M.S. , and S. Kato , unpublished data ) .
However , FKBP and cyclophilin , which have the same enzymatic activity , are not related in their amino acid sequence , suggesting the presence of at least two separate superfamilies for PPlase .
A hydropathy plot of the sequence of FKBP does not show any striking hydrophobic region that could serve as a signal peptide or a transmembrane segment ( Fig .
3 ) , indicating that the FKBP is a typical intracellular , cytosolic protein .
No information is available from physical measurements about the secondary structure of FKBP , so we used the computer program CHOFAs to predict the secondary structure using the Chou-Fasman parameters .
Overall , the distribution predicted for the 108 residues is 12 % B-pleated sheet , 33 % B-turn , and 37 % a-helix .
8-Turn and a-helix are predicted to dominate the secondary structure of FKBP .
Northern Blot Analysis .
By using P-labeled human FKBP cDNA as a probe , poly ( A ) RNAs from several different tissues were analyzed by Northern blot analysis under stringent conditions as described in Materials and Methods .

Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA prepared from human placenta .
( A ) Twenty micrograms of high molecular weight DNA digested to completion by EcoRI ( lane 1 ) , BamHI ( lane 2 ) , HindIII ( lane 3 ) , Sac I ( lane 4 ) , or Xba I ( lane 5 ) was analyzed with the FKBP cDNA probe described in the text .
( B ) As a control experiment , Southern blot analysis was done under the same conditions with a human cyclophilin cDNA probe , and this showed that more than 20 bands in the human genome hybridized with the probe .
Molecular size markers ( in kilobases ) are indicated at the left .
hybridized with FKBP cDNA was detected in all poly ( A ) * RNA preparations so far analyzed ( e.g. , RNAs from human brain , lung , placenta , liver , leukocytes , and Jurkat cells ) , indicating that the gene for FKBP is not expressed specifically in T cells but rather is expressed in many tissues .
To search for the possible involvement of FKBP in the events leading to T-cell activation , the effect of mitogenic stimulation of T cells on FKBP expression was examined .
However , induction of Jurkat T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin induction of Jurkat T cells did not affect the level of FKBP mRNA ( Fig .
4B ) , suggesting that FKBP is not an inducible protein in response to these stimulations .
The result was very similar to that of cyclophilin [ e.g. , induction of Jurkat cells by phytohemagglutinin and phorbol ester did not alter the transcription level of cyclophilin ( 12 ) ] .
Nonetheless , a report that a much greater level of cyclophilin was expressed in leukemic T cells compared to normal lymphoid tissue ( 18 ) indicates that more detailed experimentation is required for clarifying the induc-ibility of cyclophilin and FKBP in normal lymphoid cells .
Southern Blot Analysis .
To investigate the genomic complexity of human FKBP , Southern blot analysis was per-formed .
Human genomic DNA prepared from placental cells was cleaved by limited digestion with each of the five restriction enzymes ( EcoRI , BamHI , HindIII , Sac I , and Xba I ) and hybridized under highly stringent conditions with the Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 87 ( 1990 ) 5443 FKBP2 cDNA insert ( Fig .
5 ) .
For any of the restriction fragments , only a few bands were found to hybridize with the FKBP insert , suggesting that only a few copies of the FKBP gene are present in the human genome .
The multiplicity of the bands may be explained either by the possible split of a gene into multiple exons or by the presence of one or two other DNA sequences that hybridized with the FKBP gene insert isolated .
In any case , this finding is in contrast to the results that the genes for cyclophilin and its homologue appear to be present in as many as 20 copies in the mammalian genome ( 12 , 13 ) .
Those results imply that cyclophilin genes have diverged extensively during evolution and that they constitute a large gene family but that the FKBP gene , on the other hand , has not diverged as much .
The difference in genomic complexity between the cyclophilin and FKBP genes may also indicate that the functional diversity of FKBP is much less than that of cyclophilin .
We thank Dr. J. Minowada for providing Jurkat cells and Mr. K. Urakami for synthesis of the DNA probe .
