stockton-press.co.uk/onc Tpl-2 induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines by triggering multiple signaling pathways that activate NFAT and NF-xB Christos Tsatsanis ' , Christos and Philip N Tsichlis ' 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Kimmel Cancer Center , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19107 , USA The Tpl-2 kinase activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines .
Here we show that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 is inhibited by mutant signaling molecules that inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) or the calcineurin/NFAT pathways and is promoted by combinations of signaling molecules that activate these pathways .
We , therefore , conclude that signals generated by the convergence of the MAPK and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway are necessary and sufficient for the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 .
The activation of both the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven minimal promoter were shown to depend on signals transduced by Rafl .
However , it was only the IL-2 promoter whose activation by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant MEK1S218/ 222A and the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor PDO098059 .
Since the activation of NFAT is MAPK-dependent these findings suggested that the activation of MAPK by Tpl-2 is either independent or only partially dependent on MEK1 and MEK2 .
In addition , they suggested that the activation of the IL-2 promoter is under the control of not only NFAT but also a second factor whose activation is MEK-dependent .
Experiments in COS-1 and EL-4 cells confirmed both hypotheses and revealed that the second factor activated by Tpl-2 is NF-xB .
While the activation of the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven minimal promoter by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant NFATA4I8 , it was only partially blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that the Tpl-2-mediated NFAT activation is under the control of a combination of calcineurin-dependent and independent pathways .
Both pathways were fully blocked by Bel-2 or Bcl-X , .

NFAT is a complex factor composed of API and Correspondence : PN Tsichlis , Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Kimmel Cancer Center , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , PA 19107 , USA Present address : Fox Chase Cancer Center , 7701 Burholme Avenue , Philadelphia , PA 19111 , USA Received 10 July 1998 ; revised 18 September 1998 ; accepted 29 September 1998 NFAT components ( Jain et al. , 1993 ; Northrop et al. , 1993 ) .
The NFAT component is heterogeneous and is represented by at least four protein isoforms encoded by different genes that are differentially expressed in a variety of cell types .
These are NFATe ( NFATel or NFAT2 ) , NFATp ( NFATc2 or NFATI1 ) , NFAT3 and NFATx ( NFATc3 or NFAT4 ) ( Rao et al. , 1997 ) .
Activation and nuclear translocation of NFAT is regulated by phosphorylation .
This is under the control of several serine threonine protein kinases including GSK3 and JNK2 and phosphatases including calcineurin ( Shibasaki et al. , 1996 ; Chow et al. , 1997 ; Rao et al. , 1997 ) .
Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK 506 , two immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit NFAT activation , act by blocking the activation of calcineurin and the depho-sphorylation of NFAT ( Schreiber and Crabtree , 1992 ; Clipstone et al. , 1994 ; Clipstone and Crabtree , 1992 ) .
Tpl-2 , an oncogenic serine-threonine protein kinase ( Patriotis et al. , 1993 ; Ceci et al. , 1997 ) that is the subject of this report , transduces signals that promote NFAT p activation perhaps by inducing dephosphoryla-tion of the protein ( Tsatsanis et al. , 1998 ) .
NFAT isoforms expressed in different tissues regulate the expression of cytokine genes .
In the hematopoietic system , NFAT contributes to the activation of several cytokines and other early response genes including IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-8 , IL-13 , GM-CSF , IFN-y , TNF- « , CD40 ligand and Fas ligand ( Rao et al. , 1997 ) .
In addition to its role in cytokine gene expression , NFAT interacts directly with the cell cycle and apoptotic machineries .
Thus , activation of NFAT promotes both the progression from G1 to S as well as apoptosis .
Overexpressed Bel-2 interacts with calcineurin and inhibits NFAT activation ( Linette et al. , 1996 ) , while overexpression of Bax , a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins , reverses the effect of Bel-2 by blocking its interaction with calcineurin ( Shibasaki et al. , 1997 ) .
The induction of IL-2 expression following T cell stimulation depends on the activation of not only NFAT but also NF-xB , another complex transcription factor that contributes to lymphocyte activation and cytokine gene expression ( Jain et al. , 1995 ) .
NF-xB represents a protein family whose members include p65 ( ReIA ) , c-Rel , RelB , p50 ( NF-xB1l ) and p52 ( NF-xB2 ) .
Some of these proteins , such as p50 and p52 , are expressed as inactive precursors ( p105 and p100 , respectively ) that are localized primarily in the cytosol ( Thanos and Maniatis , 1995 ; Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1996 ) .
Potentially active NF-xB proteins are also localized primarily in the cytosol bound to a family of inhibitory proteins ( Ix-Ba , Ix-B # , Ix-By and Ix-Be ) ( Beg and Baldwin , 1993 , Simeonidis et a/. , 1997 ) .
NF-xB activation signals induce proteolytic cleavage of the Tpl-2 activates NFAT and NF-xB C Tsatsanis et al 2610 precursor proteins or lead to the degradation of the inhibitory Ix-B molecules ( Chen et al. , 1995 ) .
The released active NF-xB molecules translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA as homodimers or heterodimers ( Fujita et al. , 1992 ) .
Tpl-2 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that is activated by carboxy-terminal truncation during progression of MoMuLV induced T cell lymphomas and MMTV-induced mammary carcinomas ( Patriotis et al. , 1993 ; Makris et al. , 1993 ; Ceci et al. , 1997 ; Erny et al. , 1996 ) .
Earlier studies had shown that Tpl-2 transduces signals that activate the MAPKinase and the SAPKinase cascades ( Ceci et al. , 1997 ; Patriotis et al. , 1994 ; Salmeron et al. , 1996 ) .
More recent studies revealed that Tpl-2 activates NFAT in various cell types ( Tsatsanis et al. , 1998 ) and induces IL-2 expression when transfected in EL4 and Jurkat cells ( Ballester et al. , 1997 ; Tsatsanis et al. , 1998 ) .
The Tpl-2-dependent pathway leading to the activation of the IL-2 promoter in these cell lines can be triggered by TCR stimulation ( Tsatsanis et al. , 1998 ) .
In this report we show that the activation of NFAT and the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 depends on the convergence of calcineurin/NFAT and MAPK activation signals induced by Tpl-2 .
The activation of NFAT is under the control of a combination of calcineurin-dependent and calcineurin-independent pathways , both of which are blocked by Bel-2 and Bcel-X , .. Activation of the IL-2 promoter but not of the NFAT minimal promoter is fully blocked by inhibitors of MEK 1 and MEK2 .
Evidence presented in this report shows that the difference between the two promoters is due to a combination of factors : a ) the activation of the MAPK by Tpl-2 is at least in part MEK1/MEK2 independent and b ) Tpl-2 also activates NF-xB , another transcription factor that plays an obligatory role in IL-2 induction , via a MEK1/MEK2 dependent mechanism .
Results Dominant negative mutants inhibiting the MAPK and the calcineurin|NFAT pathways block the Tpl-2 mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter We had previously shown that Tpl-2 induces IL-2 expression in EL4 and Jurkat cells .
Moreover , we had shown that Tpl-2 activates NFAT , a complex transcription factor composed of NFAT and API components , whose activation is obligatory for IL-2 induction ( Jain et al. , 1992 ; Luo et al. , 1996 ; Northrop et al. , 1993 ; Rooney et al. , 1995 ) .
Since Tpl-2 activates NFAT as well as the MAPK pathway ( Ceci et al. , 1997 ; Tsatsanis et al. , 1998 ) , which is required for the activation of API ( Jain et al. , 1993 ) , we examined whether dominant negative mutants of several proteins transducing signals along these pathways inhibit the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 .
To this end , EL4 cells were cotransfected with an IL-2 promoter/ CAT reporter construct , a Tpl-2 expression construct and expression constructs of the dominant negative ( DN ) mutants Ha-ras N17 , MEK1S218/222A , RaflS621A and NFATcA418 .
The results showed that these dominant negative mutants block the Tpl-2 mediated induction of the IL-2 promoter ( Figure 1 ) and suggested that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 depends on the convergence of the MAPK and the calcineurin/NFAT pathways .
Additional experiments in the following two paragraphs provide support for this conclusion .
Wild-type Tpl-2 activates the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven promoter in Jurkat cells only when co-expressed with activated calcineurin We had previously shown that EL4 cells express IL-2 following transfection of either the wild-type or the oncogenic carboxy-terminally truncated Tpl-2 constructs ( Tsatsanis et al. , 1998 ) .
On the other hand , Jurkat cells express IL-2 , only in response to carboxy-terminally truncated Tpl-2 .
Since EL4 cells express a mutant calcineurin ( CnAD477N ) which is more sensitive to fluctuations in the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium ( Fruman et al. , 1995 ) , we hypothesized that the enhanced sensitivity of EL4 cells to Tpl-2 may be due to the partially activated calcineurin in these cells .
To test this hypothesis Jurkat cells were transfected with wild-type or truncated Tpl-2 constructs alone or in combination with the activated form of calcineurin , ACnA , and the expression of IL-2 was monitored using an ELISA assay ( Figure 2a ) .
Alternatively , the same combinations of expression constructs were cotransfected with the IL-2/CAT reporter construct and the activity of the IL-2 promoter was monitored by measuring CAT enzy-matic activity in transfected cell lysates ( Figure 2b , samples 1-4 ) .
The results confirmed the proposed hypothesis by showing that both the endogenous IL-2 promoter and the transiently transfected IL-2/CAT reporter were activated in Jurkat cells cotransfected with expression constructs of the wild-type Tpl-2 and the activated calcineurin but not wild-type Tpl-2 alone IL-2/CAT 3 50 Relative CAT activity 0 +94 Tpl-2 wt PMA/iono c-Ha-Ras N17 Raf-1 S621A MEK1 $ 218/222A SEK1 K299R NFATe A418 5 + + wa a a a a a 3 + + roan 6 4a 14.sz rog 6 a t 4 ® go 6 6 b 0 |+\IE 8 + Figure 1 Activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 is inhibited by dominant inhibitory mutants of the MAPK and the calcium/ calcineurin NFAT pathways .

Transfections were carried out in quadruplicate and expression was normalized based on the expression of B-Gal from a cotransfected CMV5/ $ -Gal construct ( Figure 2b , samples 2 and 3 ) .
Identical results were obtained when , instead of the IL-2/CAT construct , a reporter construct utilizing an NFAT-driven minimal promoter ( NFAT/CAT ) was used ( Figure 2b , samples 5-8 ) .

Role of calcineurin .
( a ) Jurkat cells were cotransfected with wild-type or truncated ( tr ) Tpl-2 with or without ACnA .
Control cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin 36 h later and they were harvested after an additional 8 h period .
IL-2 expression was measured by ELISA .
( b ) Jurkat cells were cotransfected with the IL-2/CAT or the NFAT/CAT reporter construct and wild-type Tpl-2 with or without ACnA or NFATc .
Control cells were stimulated 36 h later with PMA and ionomycin .
Cells were harvested at 44 h following transfection .
CAT activity was measured in the cell lysates and quantitated by phospho-imager .
All transfections were carried out in quadruplicate and expression was normalized based on the expression of $ -Gal from a cotransfected CMV construct Tpl-2 activates NFAT and NF-xB C Tsatsanis et al activators of the NFAT pathway NFAT , NFATp , NFATx , ACnA and CAML failed to do so ( Figure 3 ) .
These findings confirmed that the activation of neither the MAPK nor the calcineurin/NFAT pathway alone is sufficient to activate the NFAT-driven promoter .
To test whether the concerted activation of the two pathways activates the NFAT-driven promoter , EL4 cells were cotransfected with the reporter NFAT/CAT construct and expression constructs of Raf1 Y340D and each of the listed activators of the NFAT pathway .
The results confirmed that the synergistic action of RaflY340D and NFATc , NFATp or ACn¥A is sufficient to activate the NFAT-driven minimal promoter ( Figure 3 , samples 4 , 6 and 12 ) .
Therefore , the activation of NFAT by Tpl-2 is due to the combined activation of these pathways both of which are known to be induced by Tpl-2 ( Tsatsanis et a/. , 1998 ) .
Cyclosporin A inhibits partially while Bel-2 and Bel-X , inhibit fully the Tpl-2-mediated activation of NFAT CsA is an immunosuppressant that inhibits IL-2 expression by blocking the calcineurin-mediated activation of NFAT induced by phorbol esters and ionomycin .
Treatment of the Tpl-2 transfected EL4 cells with CsA only partially blocked activation of the IL-2 and the NFAT-driven minimal promoter ( Figure 4a , sample 3 and Figure 4b , samples 7 and 9 ) .
This finding which was unexpected given the profound inhibition of both promoters by the dominant negative mutant NFATcA418 ( Figure 1 , sample 7 and Figure 5 , sample 7 ) suggests that Tpl-2 acts through both CsA-sensitive and CsA -insensitive pathways to activate NFAT .
A CsA insensitive pathway which is activated by PMA and CD28 co-stimulation has been previously reported ( Ghosh et al. , 1996 ) .

Evidence presented in Figure 4b shows that v-Ha-Ras , similar to Tpl-2 , is sufficient to activate NFAT in EL-4 cells .
Moreover , the dominant negative mutant Ha-RasN17 blocks the Tpl-2-mediated activation of NFAT ( Figure 5 , sample 3 ) .
Interestingly , while the activation of NFAT by Tpl-2 is only partially blocked by CsA ( Figure 4b , sample 7 ) the activation of NFAT A .

These findings suggest that the activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway by Tpl-2 depends on a combination of Ras-dependent and independent signals .
The Ras-independent signal is not inhibited by CsA and therefore operates downstream of calcineurin .

Transfected cells were treated with CsA as indicated .

CsA was added at 24 h following transfection and PMA and ionomycin at 36 h following transfection .

Transfections were carried out in quadruplicate .
Expression was normalized based on the expression of $ -Gal from a cotransfected CMV 5/ $ -Gal construct .
( ¢ ) Activation of NFAT by Tpl-2 is inhibited by Bel-2 and Bel-X ; , but not by Mcl-1 .
EL4 cells were co-transfected with Tpl-2 and the corresponding expression constructs and the NFAT/CAT reporter plasmid .
CAT activity was measured as described .
Each bar represents the average of triplicate samples .
The experiment was repeated at least three times tion ( Figure 4¢c ) .
These findings suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-X ; inhibit both signals .
Similarly , activation of NFAT by PMA and ionomycin was fully blocked by Bcl-2 and Bcl-X , but not Mcl-1 ( Figure 4c¢c ) .
Earlier studies had shown that Bcl-2 binds calcineurin A at the catalytic domain and sequesters it at the plasma membrane , thus preventing it from dephosphorylating NFAT ( Shibasaki et a/. , 1997 ) .
The mechanism by which Bcl-2 and Bcl-X ; block the signal operating downstream of calcineurin remains unknown .
The dominant negative mutant MEK1S218/222A blocks the activation of the IL-2 promoter but not the NFAT-driven promoter by Tpl-2 The experiment on the regulation of the IL-2 promoter/CAT reporter shown in Figure 1 was repeated with the NFAT/CAT reporter construct .
The pattern of inhibition of the NFAT-driven promoter by the dominant negative mutants shown in Figure 5 was identical to the pattern of inhibition of the IL-2 promoter by the same mutants with the exception of MEK1§8218/222A which inhibited fully the Tpl-2-induced activation of the IL-2 promoter but only partially the activation of the NFAT-driven promoter .
Similar results were obtained using the MEK inhibitor PDO098059 ( Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals ) ( data not shown ) .
Since the activation of NFAT is MAPK-dependent these findings suggest that the Tpl-2-mediated activation of MAPK is , at least partially , independent of MEK 1 or MEK .
Tpl-2 activates the MAPK ERK1 via a MEKI ! -independent pathway To test the hypothesis that the activation of the MAPK by Tpl-2 is MEK l-independent we examined whether MEK1 is required for the activation of the MAPK ERK 1 by Tpl-2 in COS-1 cells .
Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant MEK 18218/222A inhibited minimally the activation of ERK1 by Tpl-2 while it inhibited fully the activation of ERK 1 by EGF .
Similar results were obtained when the cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PDO098059 ( Figure 6 ) .
This observation confirmed that Tpl-2 activates the MAPK and showed that the activation of MAPK by Tpl-2 is at least in part MEK 1/MEK2-independent .
Tpl-2 activates NF-kB by a MEK-dependent mechanism .
NF-kB activation is required for Tpl-2-mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter The difference between the IL-2 and NFAT promoters regarding their induction by Tpl-2 in the presence or absence of MEK 18218/222A suggests that Tpl-2 may regulate the activity of additional transcription factors that contribute to the activation of the IL-2 promoter and are activated via a MEK1/MEK2-dependent mechanism .
Activation of the IL-2 promoter relies on the simultaneous activation of the transcription factors NFAT , API , NF-xB and Oct ( Figure 7a ) ( Garrity et al. , 1994 ; Rooney et al. , 1995 ) .
Of these , NFAT and NF-xB are obligatory for the activation of the IL-2 promoter .
Thus , mutation of the NF-xB binding site or one of the NFAT sites of the IL-2 promoter blocked Tpl-2 activates NFAT and NF-xB C Tsatsanis et al its responsiveness to either Tpl-2 or PMA and ionomycin ( Figure 7b ) .
Moreover , overexpression of Ik-Ba inhibited the Tpl-2 mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter ( Figure 7¢ ) .
We therefore tested whether Tpl-2 activates NF-xB , and whether the potential activation of this factor is MEK -dependent .
The data in Figure 7d revealed that Tpl-2 indeed activates NF-xB in EL4 cells and that the dominant negative mutants MEK 18218/222A , Ha-Ras NFAT/CAT 100 7 50 Relative CAT activity Tpl-2 wt PMA/iono c-Ha-Ras N17 Raf-1 S621A MEK1 $ 218/222A SEK1 K299R NFATe A 418 wn a a a b , a 2 + 6064 d g. d gets 5 6 + + + = - + +lllll+q2 Koa aa d get ge Figure 5 Activation of the NFAT/CAT reporter by Tpl-2 was inhibited by different dominant inhibitory mutants of the MAPK and the Calcineurin/NFAT pathways .

CAT activity was measured as described Extracellular signals [ binding site ra y '' y NFAT nucleus NFAT binding site ] Figure 8 - Model of Tpl-2 mediated activation of NFAT and NF-xB .
The activation of NFAT and NF-xB can be induced either by TCR stimulation or pharmacologically using ionomycin , which stimulates calcium influx , and PMA which activates PKC .
Tpl-2 transduces some of these signals leading to the activation of NFAT and NF-xB N17 and Rafl8621A block its activation .
We conclude that Tpl-2 activates NF-xB in a MEK 1-dependent and NFAT in a MEK 1-independent fashion .
Discussion In the present study we examined the pathways through which Tpl-2 activates NFAT and induces expression of IL-2 in lymphoid cell lines .
The results show that the activation of both the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT regulated basal SV40 promoter by Tpl-2 is mediated by the MAPK pathway in combination with the calcium dependent calcineurin/NFAT pathway .
Inhibition of the MAPK or the calcineurin pathway abrogated IL-2 and NFAT promoter activation by Tpl-2 .
These findings led us to propose the model of NFAT and IL-2 promoter activation by Tpl-2 shown in Figure 8 .
This model takes into account the fact that NFAT is a complex factor composed of API and NFAT components ( Northrop et al. , 1993 ) .
Activation of the MAPK by Tpl-2 according to this model occurs through at least two distinct signals , one that is MEK-dependent and one that is MEK -independent .
Both the MEK-dependent and independent signals are transduced via Ha-ras and Rafl .
Therefore , Tpl-2 signals activating the MAPK diverge downstream of Rafl .
Tpl-2 also initiates signals that activate NFAT ( Tsatsanis et al. , 1998 ) .
These signals are inhibited by cyclosporin only partially , suggesting that Tpl-2 operates both upstream and downstream of calcineurin .
The same signals are fully blocked by Bel-2 and Bel-X ; .
Combination of the above signals leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of NFAT and NF-xB , two transcription factors , that are obligatory for the activation of the IL-2 promoter .
According to this model , NFAT is activated via the convergence of the MAPK pathway that contributes to the activation of the API component of NFAT , and the calcineurin NFAT pathway .
The lack of inhibition of the activation of the IL-2 and the NFAT promoter by the dominant negative mutant SEKIK299R suggests Tpl-2 activates NFAT and NF-xB C Tsatsanis et al that the contribution of the SAPK pathway may not be critical for the activation of NFAT by Tpl-2 .
Alternatively , SAPK may be activated by pathways ( Su et al. , 1994 ) that are SEK 1 -independent .
Activation of the NFAT-regulated minimal promoter in EL4 cells following transient transfection of activated Rafl ( Raf1 Y340D ) and activated calcineurin ( ACnA¥ ) or activated NFATc provided support to this model .
Additional support was provided by experiments comparing the activation of the IL-2 promoter and the NFAT-regulated minimal SV40 promoter in EL4 and Jurkat cells .
Data presented here show that the carboxy-terminally truncated Tpl-2 activates NFAT in both cell lines , while the wild-type Tpl-2 activates NFAT only in EL4 cells Since the EL4 cells express a mutant calcineurin ( CnA D477N ) which exhibits enhanced sensitivity to increases in the cytoplasmic calcium levels , and is therefore partially activated ( Fruman et al. , 1995 ) , we hypothesized that the enhanced responsiveness of EL4 cells to Tpl-2 is due to the lower threshold for the activation of calcineurin in these cells .
To address this hypothesis , we cotransfected Jurkat cells with wild-type Tpl-2 in combination with an expression construct of an activated mutant of calcineurin ( ACnA¥ ) .
The results provided support for the model by showing that the combination of the two activates NFAT and induces IL-2 expression .
According to the model in Figure 8 , Ras plays a central role in the activation of NFAT by Tpl-2 .
Data presented here indeed show that Ha-ras-N17 , a dominant negative mutant of Ha-ras , blocks Tpl-2-induced NFAT activation .
In addition , Raf1S8621A , a dominant negative mutant of Rafl , which inhibits the Tpl-2- and v-Ha-ras-induced activation of the MAPK ( Patriotis et al. , 1994 ) , also inhibits the Tpl-2-induced activation of the IL-2 and NFAT promoters ( Figure 1 and 4 ) .
However , Raf1 Y340D , an active form of Raf , activated the MAPK pathway ( Patriotis et al. , 1994 ) but failed to activate NFAT and the IL-2 promoter ( Figure 2 and data not shown ) .
Therefore , Rafl is required but it is not sufficient to drive the NFAT or the IL-2 promoters , indicating that Ras needs additional effectors that activate calcineurin to initiate transcription from these promoters .
Although CsA fully blocks the activation of NFAT by v-Ha-ras it only partially inhibits the activation of NFAT by Tpl-2 .
This suggests that Tpl-2 may activate NFAT via Ras-dependent signals that activate calcineurin and through Ras-independent signals that function downstream of calcineurin .
Both Bel-2 and Bcl-X , fully block the Tpl-2-mediated NFAT activation .
We therefore conclude that Bcl-2 and Bel-X ; , block both NFAT activation pathways triggered by Tpl-2 and not only the activation of calcineurin as originally suggested ( Shibasaki et a/. , 1997 ) .
Bcl-2 binds the catalytic domain of calcineurin through its BH4 domain , suggesting that it may also bind a related phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT and is CsA-resistant .
The BH4 domains of Bcel-2 and Bel- X ; share high homology in contrast to the BH4 domain of Mcl-1 which is more distant ( Sato et al. , 1994 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that Bel- X , and Mcl-1 may differ in their ability to bind the catalytic domain of calcineurin .
The calcineurin-independent pathway of NFAT activation may be the same as the one originally proposed by ( Ghosh et al. , 1996 ) .
2615 Tpl-2 activates NFAT and NF-xB C Tsatsanis et al 2616 Experiments presented in this report revealed that the Tpl-2-mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter also depends on the activation of NF-xB , which is mediated by a MEK 1 dependent mechanism .
Although there is no published direct evidence to date that MEK 1 is involved in the activation of NF-xB , recent studies have shown that Rafl , the activator of MEK 1 , activates NF-kB perhaps by contributing to the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of Ix-Ba « ( Lee et al. , 1997 ) .
The investigation of the role of Tpl-2 in NF-xB activation was triggered by the surprizing finding that inhibition of MEK1 and MEK2 blocked the Tpl-2-induced activation of the IL-2 promoter , but had no effect on the Tpl-2-mediated activation of the NFAT-driven minimal promoter .
Since the activation of NFAT depends on the activation of the MAPK pathway this finding suggested that the Tpl-2-mediated activation of the MAPK is MEK 1l-independent .
In addition , it suggested that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 depends on the MEK-dependent activation of another obligatory pathway .
The data presented in this report confirmed both hypothesis and demonstrated that the MEK-dependent pathway that is activated by Tpl-2 and contributes to the activation of the IL-2 promoter is the NF-xB activation pathway .
The MEK -dependence of the Tpl-2-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway was examined in transiently transfected COS-1 cells .
The Tpl-2-mediated activation of the MAPK ERK 1 in these cells was mainly MEK 1-independent .
However , since Tpl-2 phosphorylates MEK1 in vitro ( Salmeron et al. , 1996 ) , the Tpl-2-induced MAPK activation may be transduced , at least in part , via MEK1 .
The activation of NF-xB by Tpl-2 was not surprizing .
The sequence of the Tpl-2 kinase domain suggests that Tpl-2 is a member of the family of MAP3Kinases that includes MEKK1 ( Patriotis et a/. , 1993 ; Ichijo et al. , 1997 , Malinin et al. , 1997 ) .
Earlier studies had shown that MEKK1 and the related NF-xB-inducing kinase ( NIK ) associate with and activate the large molecular weight complex that phosphorylates Ix-B ( Lee et al. , 1997 , DiDonato et al. , 1997 , Mercurio et al. , 1997 , Zandi et al. , 1997 ) .
More recent studies have shown that indeed MEKK1 as well as NIK phosphorylate and activate the Ix-B kinases IKK « and IKKB ( Lee et al. , 1998 ; Karin and Delhase , 1998 ) .
Based on these observations and our data we suggest that Tpl-2 may also phosphorylate the Ix-B kinases .
The multiplicity of kinases that may be able to activate the Ix-B kinases suggests that each of them may be involved in the transduction of some but not all NF-kB activation signals .
Since these kinases are multifunctional in that Tpl-2 also activates both the MAPK and the SAPK pathways ( Ceci et al. , 1997 ; Patriotis et al. , 1994 ; Salmeron et al. , 1996 ) , MEKK1 activates the SAPK pathway ( Yan et al. , 1994 ) and NIK activates neither , their selective utilization by different signals can provide significant specificity to the cellular response .
If Tpl-2 is involved in the phosphorylation of the Ix-B kinases , the role of MEKI/MEK2 suggested by our findings is not currently clear .
One possibility is that MEK1/MEK2 plays an intermediate role in this process and provides a complimentary signal .
Overall , the data presented in this report show that Tpl-2 , a proto-oncogene associated with tumor progression in retrovirus induced rodent T-cell lymphomas activates multiple signaling pathways .
The activation of NFAT and NF-xB and the induction of IL-2 in T cells through these pathways suggests that Tpl-2 may play an important role in T cell activation and defines a potential molecular mechanism that may contribute to its oncogenic potential .

Tpl-2 activates NFAT and NF-xB C Tsatsanis et al 1 ml kinase wash buffer containing 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.5 , 5 mM MgCl , and 1 mM dithiothreitol .
In-gel kinase assays were carried out as previously described ( Patriotis et al. , 1994 ) .
Briefly , pelleted immuno-precipitates were electrophoresed in SDS 10 % polyacryla-mide gel containing myelin basic protein ( MBP , Sigma ) at 0.25 mg/ml .
Subsequently the gel was treated with several changes of 50 mm Tris HCI ( pH 8.0 ) in 20 % isopropyl alcohol for 1 h and for an additional hour with 50 mM Tris HCIl/6m guanidinium chloride/5 mM beta mercaptoethanol .
The gel was then incubated at 4°C for 16 h in Tris HCI ( pH 8.0 ) /0.04 % ( v/v ) Tween 20/5 mM beta mercaptoethanol .
Subsequently the gel was equilibrated for 30 min in kinase buffer ( 40 mm HEPES , pH 8.0/ 2 mM dithiothreitol/ 0.1 mM EGTA/ 5 mM magnesium acetate ) .
Finally , the gel was incubated for 1 h in kinase buffer containing 20 mM ATP and 150 Ci [ y- '' PJATP ( Amersham ; 3000 Ci/mmol ) .
The unincorporated ATP was removed by washing for 2-2.5 h with several changes of 5 % ( w/v ) trichloroacetic acid 1 % ( w/ v ) sodium pyrophosphate .
The gel was then dried and exposed to XAR film ( Kodak ) .
Immunoblotting SDS-PAGE and electroblotting were carried out as previously described ( Patriotis et al. , 1994 ) .
The antibodies and the dilutions at which they were used were as follows : anti-HA tag ( HA.11 , BaBco ) ( 1/1000 dilution ) , anti-T'pl-2 ( PT492 rabbit polyclonal ) ( 1/1000 dilution ) , anti-MEKI1 ( SC-219 , Santa Cruz ) ( 1/1000 dilution ) .
Excess antibody was removed by two 10 min and three 5 min washes in PBS containing 0.1 % ( v/v ) Tween-20 .
Antigen-bound antibody was detected by a 60 min room temperature incubation in a 1/5000 dilution of the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( Amersham ) .
The unbound secondary antibody was removed using the same washing procedure we used to remove the excess primary antibody with three additional 10 min washes in PBS .
The binding of the secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL , Amersham ) .
Immuno-blots were exposed to Reflection NEF film ( NEN , DuPont ) for 1-10 min .
