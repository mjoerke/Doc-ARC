Upon functional activation of granulocytes by 4 $ -phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , the levels of c-jun , jun B and jun D transcripts were increased .
The three jun genes showed a similar time course in their induction by PMA , maximal mRNA levels being reached after 60 min of induction .
These results suggest that expression of c-jun , jun B and jun D genes might be involved in terminal granulocyte differentiation or in regulating granulocyte functionality .
INTRODUCTION The proto-oncogene c-jun encodes for the transcriptional factor AP-1 [ 1,2 ] .
This c-Jun/AP-1 protein has been shown to be associated with the c-Fos oncoprotein in some transcriptional activators [ 3-6 ] .
Two other c-jun-related cDNAs have been isolated ( jun B and jun D ) , whose encoded proteins show extensive amino acid sequence identity with c-Jun/AP-1 and are able to form nuclear complexes with c-Fos or Fos-related proteins [ 7,8 ] .
It has been found that human granulocytes express constitutively high levels of c-fos mRNA [ 9-12 ] , which were increased upon cell activation by distinct stimuli [ 9-13 ] .
Thus it was of importance to examine the expression of the jun family genes in granulocytes .
In this context , the expression of c-jur mRNA in human myelomonocytic cells has been recently reported [ 14 ] .
The present study was performed to analyse the expression of the three proto-oncogenes c-jun , jun B and jun D at the mRNA level in freshly isolated human peripheral-blood granulocytes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells Granulocytes were obtained from fresh human peripheral blood after dextran-induced sedimentation of erythrocytes and density-gradient centrifugation of the leucocyte-rich supernatant on Lymphoprep , and hypo-osmotic lysis of contaminating erythrocytes as previously described [ 15 ] .
Isolated granulocytes contained more than 98 % , neutrophils and less than 1 % contaminating mononuclear cells , as assessed by Giemsa-Wright stain and flow-cytometric analysis .
Cell viability was evaluated by Trypan Blue exclusion , and was always higher than 98 % .
The human promyelocytic cell line HL60 [ 16 ] and the human promonocytic cell line U937 were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere ( CO , /air , 1:19 ) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) heat-inactivated fetal-calf serum , 2 mM-L-glutamine , penicillin ( 100 units/ml ) and gentamycin ( 24 ug/ml ) .
RNA analysis Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl method [ 17 ] and analysed ( 10 ug of RNA ) , either by electro-phoresis through 1.1 % ( w/v ) agarose/formaldehyde gels , fol- lowed by transfer to Hybond-N nylon membranes , or by dot-blot hybridization as previously described [ 18 ] .
*°P-labelled cDNA probes were prepared using the random oligonucleotide priming method ( Oligo-Labelling Kit ; Pharm-acia ) to a specific radioactivity equal to , or higher than , 7x 10° c.p.m./ug of cDNA .
The plasmid AH119 [ 19 ] , containing c-jun , was generously provided by Dr. R. Bravo ( Squibb Institute , Princeton , NJ , U.S.A. ) .
cDNA probes for jun B [ 20 ] and jur D [ 21 ] were kindly provided by Dr. P. Sassone-Corsi ( LGME , CNRS , Strasbourg , France ) .
The plasmid pAc 18.1 [ 22 ] was used as a probe for $ -actin .
# -Actin mRNA was employed as a control probe .
Northern and dot-blots were prehybridized at 42 °C for 24 h in a buffer containing 50 % formamide , 0.75 m-NaCl , 0.2 % SDS , 25 mM-EDTA , 5 x Denhardt 's solution ( 1 x Denhardt 's is 0.02 % BSA/0.02 % Ficoll/0.02 % polyvinylpyrrolidone ) , 25 mm-Pipes ( pH 6.8 ) and salmon sperm DNA ( 100 ug/ml ) .
Blots then were hybridized in the above buffer containing 1 x Denhardt 's solution , 10 % ( w/v ) dextran sulphate and 10 '' c.p.m .
of probe at 42 °C for 16-24 h. After hybridization , the blots were washed twice in 2xSSC ( 1xSSC is 0.15 m-NaC1/0.015 m-sodium citrate ) /0.1 % SDS for 30 min each wash at room temperature , once with the same buffer at 42 °C , twice in 0.1 % SSC/0.1 % SDS for 15 min at 42 °C , and once more with the same buffer for 15 min at 60 °C .
Subsequently , blots were air-dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with enhancing screens at -80 °C .
Quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms was performed by integration of peak areas after scanning with a Molecular Dynamics 300A computing densitometer Fast Scan .
Labelled probes were removed from filters by immersion in boiling 2 % ( v/v ) glycerol for 2 min .
Before hybridization to a second probe , removal of radioactivity was verified by auto-radiography .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Total RNA was extracted from highly purified granulocytes isolated from human peripheral blood and analysed by Northern and dot-blot techniques using specific probes for c-jun , jun B and jun D. We found that the average content of cell RNA in granulocytes ranged from 4.8 to 5.6 ug of cells .
This value is very low when compared with that found in other cell Abbreviations used : PMA , 4 $ -phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .

Northern-blot analysis of the c-jun , jun B and jur D mRNA in human peripheral-blood granulocytes Total RNA was isolated from unstimulated control granulocytes ( °C `` ) as well as from granulocytes stimulated with PMA ( 20 ng/ml ) for 60 min at 37°C ( PMA ) , and Northern-blot analysis was carried out as described in the Materials and methods section .
The sizes of the transcripts for c-jun ( ~ 2.7 kb and ~3.4 kb ) , jun B ( ~ 2.1 kb ) and jun D ( ~ 2.0 kb ) are indicated .
# -Actin mRNA was used as a control .
Autoradiograms were developed after 3 or 24 h of exposure as indicated .
types , such as the human promonocytic cell line U937 ( about 60 4g of RNA/10 '' cells ) or the human promyelocytic cell line HL60 ( about 40 4g of RNA/10* cells ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , high levels of c-jun , jun B and jun D mRNA could be detected constitutively in unstimulated granulocytes .
However , unstimulated granulocytes expressed much higher levels of jun B and jun D transcripts than of c-jun transcripts ( Fig .
1 ) .
Unlike granulocytes , uninduced U937 and HL6Q cells did not express detectable levels of c-jun , jun B and jun D mRNA ( results not shown ) .
Treatment of granulocytes with the cell-activating agent 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) enhanced the levels of c-jun , jun B F. Mollinedo , M. J. Vaquerizo and J. R. Naranjo and jun D transcripts ( Fig .
1 ) .
Densitometric analysis revealed a 3-4-fold increase in the mRNA levels of the three jun family members upon cell treatment with 20 ng of PMA/ml for 60 min .
The size of the c-jur mRNA was about 2.7 kb , as already reported [ 1,2 ] .
A minor band of about 3.4 kb , suggested to be a precursor molecule [ 1,2 ] , was also evident , but only after overexposure of the autoradiogram .
The sizes of jun B and jun D transcripts were about 2.1 and 2.0 kb respectively , as already reported [ 10,21 ] .
The level of expression found for c-jun mRNA was comparable with that found for the 2.2 kb c-fos mRNA ( [ 9 ] ; F. Mollinedo & J. R. Naranjo , unpublished work ) .
Under the experimental conditions used in the Northern-blot analysis there was no cross-hybridization between the three jun probes .
This lack of cross-hybridization was evidenced by : ( a ) differences in the sizes of the respective mRNAs for c-jun ( ~ 2.7 kb ) , jun B ( ~ 2.1 kb ) and jun D ( ~ 2.0 kb ) ( Fig .
1 ) ; ( b ) a different basal and induced expression of the three c-jun , jun B and jun D transcripts in granulocytes ( Fig .
1 ) ; ( c ) a distinct regulation in the expression of the three c-jun , jun B and jun D transcripts during macrophage-cell differentiation of U937 and HL60 cells induced by PMA , reaching maximal levels of jun B , jun D and c-jun transcripts after 30 min , 6 h and 24 h of induction respectively ( F. Mollinedo & J. R. Naranjo , unpublished work ) .
Time-course experiments showed , by dot-blot analysis , that jun B , jun D and c-jun mRNA levels were augmented as early as 15-30 min after the addition of PMA , reaching their maximal levels ( 3-4-fold increase ) at 60 min .
Thereafter , jun B , jun D and c-jun mRNA levels decreased to values close to the preinduction levels within 2 h ( Fig .
2 ) .
The results herein reported demonstrate for the first time that c-jun , jun B and jun D proto-oncogenes are expressed constitutively in freshly isolated human peripheral-blood granulocytes and that the basal levels of the three c-jun , jun B and jun D mRNAs are increased by functional granulocyte activation with PMA .
Furthermore , as mature granulocytes do not proliferate and are unable to undergo further differentiation , these results also demonstrate that the three c-jun , jun B and jun D genes are expressed in a terminally differentiated non-proliferating cell type .
The three jun proto-oncogenes studied have been shown to be associated with c-Fos or Fos-related proteins to form transcriptional regulators [ 3-8 ] .
Thus the data reported here suggest that expression of jun and fos proto-oncogenes might be involved in regulating gene expression related to granulocyte functionality or terminal cell differentiation .
