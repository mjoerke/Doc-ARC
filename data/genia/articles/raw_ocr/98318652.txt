Davie , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , May 11 , 1998 ( received for review February 5 , 1998 ) ABSTRACT Local hypoxemia and stasis trigger throm-bosis .
We have demonstrated previously that in a murine model of normobaric hypoxia pulmonary fibrin deposition is a result of expression of tissue factor , especially in oxygen-deprived mononuclear phagocytes ( MPs ) .
We now show that transcription factor early-growth-response gene product ( Egr-1 ) is rapidly activated in hypoxia , both in vitro and in vivo , and is responsible for transcription and expression of tissue factor in hypoxic lung .
MPs and Hela cells subjected to hypoxia ( pO ; ~13 torr ) had increased levels of tissue factor transcripts ( ~18-fold ) and an increased rate of transcription ( ~15-fold ) , based on nuclear run-on analysis .
Gel-shift analysis of nuclear extracts from hypoxic MPs and HeLa cells demonstrated increased DNA-binding activity at the serum response region ( SRR ; -111/+14 bp ) of the tissue factor promoter at Egr-1 motifs .
Using P-labeled Egr consensus oligonucleotide , we observed induction of DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic lung and HeLa cells because of activation of Egr-1 , by means of supershift analysis .
Transient transfection of HeLa cells with chimeric plasmids containing wild-type or mutant SRR from the tissue factor promoter showed that intact Sp1 sites are necessary for basal promoter activity , whereas the integrity of Egr-1 sites was required for hypoxia-enhanced expression .
A central role for Egr-1 in hypoxia-mediated tissue factor expression was confirmed by experiments with homozygous Egr-1 null mice ; wild-type mice subjected to oxygen deprivation expressed tissue factor and showed fibrin deposition , but hypoxic homozygous Egr-1 null mice displayed neither tissue factor nor fibrin .
These data delineate a novel biology for hypoxia-induced fibrin deposition , in which oxygen deprivation-induced activation of Egr-1 , resulting in expression of tissue factor , has an unexpected and central role .
Venous thrombosis , long associated with local hypoxemia and stasis , has a substantial morbidity and mortality , affecting 2-4 persons per 1,000 each year ( 1-4 ) .
Many studies have addressed means of preventing propagation of nascent thrombi , by inhibiting the contribution of platelets and/or plasma coagulation proteins , or by dissolving preformed fibrin , by using fibrinolytic agents .
Much less attention has focused on mechanisms underlying the genesis of thrombi , such as that which occurs in stasis , accompanying limb immobilization , by far the most frequent thrombotic disorder in otherwise healthy individuals ( 1 , 2 ) .
Almost 20 years ago , brief immobilization of canine extremities was shown to depress blood oxygen tension The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

8298 in the deep venous circulation to virtually undetectable levels ( 3 , 4 ) .
A particularly susceptible locus for thrombus formation in this condition was the parietal aspect of the venous valve pocket , where oxygen tension fell off most quickly , strongly suggesting a link between hypoxemia and activation of coagulation ( 5 ) .
Although multiple metabolic and hemodynamic factors contribute to the dysfunction of ischemic vasculature , oxygen deprivation is the common denominator .
We therefore have sought to analyze how it contributes to triggering of procoagulant events in hypoxemic vasculature .
Previously , we found that in a hypoxic environment , fibrin deposition occurred in pulmonary vasculature of otherwise normal mice , and that this was a result of de novo expression of tissue factor , especially in oxygen-deprived mononuclear phagocytes ( 6 ) .
We now have observed that hypoxia causes increased transcription of the tissue factor gene mediated by activation of the transcription factor early-growth-response gene product ( Egr-1 ) .
Hypoxic mononuclear phagocytes ( MPs ) and HeLa cells showed increased tissue factor mRNA and increased rates of transcrip-tion , as compared with normoxic controls .
Diminished levels of oxygen caused enhanced nuclear-binding activity for Egr-1 sites in the tissue factor promoter , as well as consensus Egr oligonucleotide .
Based on transient transfection analysis , Egr-1 motifs in the tissue factor promoter were critical for hypoxia-mediated transcription of the tissue factor gene .
Experiments in homozygous Egr-1 null mice displayed parallel suppression of tissue factor induction and fibrin formation , compared with wild-type controls , consistent with a central role for Egr-1 .
We propose that activation of Egr-1 is responsible for tissue factor expression in hypoxemic vasculature , thereby triggering a procoagulant pathway eventuating in fibrin formation .
METHODS Cell Culture and in Vifro Analysis of Tissue Factor Gene Expression .
MPs were harvested from human peripheral blood by differential centrifugation ( Histopaque 1077 , Sigma ) , and plated in RPMI 1640 medium with fetal bovine serum ( 10 % ) for 48 hr ( 6 ) .
Experiments were also performed with the rat macrophage line ( NR8383 ) obtained from ATCC and grown in F12K medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( 15 % ) .
HeLa cells , obtained from ATCC , were grown in DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum Abbreviations : EGR-1 , ecarly-growth-response gene product ; MP , mononuclear phagocyte ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ; SRR , serum response region ; HIF-1 , hypoxia-inducible factor-1 .

( 10 % ) .
Serum-starved cells ( 24 hr ) were subjected to hypoxia after replacement of the growth medium with fresh medium preequilibrated with the hypoxic gas mixture ( 6 ) .
The balance of the atmosphere was made up of carbon dioxide ( pCO ; ~ 40 torr ) and water vapor ( ~47 torr ) , both of which were kept constant , via an automated valve system .
Oxygen content of medium bathing the cells was maintained between 12 and 14 torr .
Cell viability was maintained throughout experiments performed under the above hypoxic conditions up to the longest time point .
Northern Analysis .
Cultured MPs or HeLa cells were deprived of serum for 24 hr and then subjected to normoxia or hypoxia for 4 hr followed by harvesting of RNA .
Total RNA ( 30 ug/lane ) , isolated by using TRIzol Reagent ( GIBCO/ BRL ) from MPs , HeLa cells , or murine lung , was subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8 % agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Duralon-UV membranes ( Stratagene ) .
Membranes were hybridized with human or mouse tissue factor cDNA fragments ( 6 ) , the latter labeled by using [ « - '' '' P ] dCTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol , DuPont ) , and then were exposed to Kodak Biomax film at -80°C .
Membranes were stripped and rehybridized with human B-actin cDNA probe as a control for RNA loading .
Nuclear Run-On Analysis .
Cultured MPs or HeLa cells were deprived of serum for 24 hr and then subjected to normoxia or hypoxia for 4 hr .
Nuclei were isolated and in vitro transcription was performed as described ( 7 ) .
Gel-Shift Assays .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from MPs , HeLa cells , or murine lung after exposure to hypoxia by the procedure of Dignam et al .
( 8 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) was performed by using oligonucleotide probes from the serum response region ( SRR ) of the tissue factor gene , denoted R1 ( -114/-89 ) , R2 ( -96/-66 ) , and R3 ( -77/=-46 ) ( 9 ) or consensus oligonucleotide probes for AP-1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , HIF-1 [ 5'-GCCCTACGTGCT-GTCTCA-3 '' ; ( 10 ) ] , Sp1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , nuclear factor interleukin 6 ( NF-IL-6 ) ( 7 ) , or Egr ( Santa Cruz Bio-technology ) .
In each case , double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were 5 ' end-labeled with [ °°P ] JATP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ) by using T4 polynucleotide kinase and standard procedures ( 11 ) .
Binding reactions were performed as described ( 7 ) .
Where indicated , antiserum to Egr-1 or nonimmune IgG was incubated with nuclear extract at room temperature for 1 hr , and then the procedure was as described ( 14 ) .
Samples ( 5 ug of protein in each lane ) were loaded directly onto nondenaturing polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide ( 6 % ) gels prepared in 0.5 % TBE ( 45 mM Tris/45 mM boric acid/1 mM EDTA ) .
The gels were pre-run for 20 min before samples were loaded .
Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 1.5-2 hr at 200 V. For competition studies , a 100-fold molar excess of one of the above unlabeled probes was employed .
Transient Transfection .
HeLa cells were cotransfected by using lipofectamine reagent ( GIBCO ) .
Supercoiled plasmid DNAs were prepared by Endofree Plasmid Maxikit ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) .
The constructs pTF ( -111/+14 ) Luc , pT-F ( EGR-1m ) Luc , pTF ( SP1m ) Luc , and pTF ( EGR-1m/SP1 m ) -Luc were prepared as described previously ( 9 ) .
To make constructs pYSF60 and pYSF61 , the two 27-bp oligonucleotides shown in Fig .
3B were ligated to the basal thymidine kinase promoter ( 7 ) and the luciferase reporter gene ( from pGL3 ; Promega ) .
Briefly , the day before transfection , exponentially growing cells were harvested by trypsinization , re-plated at a density of 4 X 10° per 35-mm well in DMEM containing fetal bovine serum ( 2 % ) , and cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO ; until they reached 50-80 % confluence .
DNA-lipofectamine complexes were prepared by combining one of the above constructs ( 1 mg ) and pCMV-B-galactosidase DNA ( 1 ug ) , as well as 12 ul of lipofectamine reagent in 0.2 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEM1 Reduced Serum Medium ( GIBCO/BRL ) , respectively , followed by incubation at room temperature for 45 Proc .

Then , the complexes were mixed with 1 ml of OPTI-MEM1 .
After 6 hr of transfection , cultures were washed twice with balanced salt solution ( PBS ) , and then the medium was changed to DMEM containing 2 % fetal bovine serum .
After another 30 hr at 37°C , medium from cultures was aspirated , cells were washed with balanced salt solution , and serum-free DMEM was added .
Cells were incubated for 6 hr at 37°C with 5 % CO ; in normoxia or hypoxia .
After the incubation period , cell extracts were prepared by using Reporter Lysis Buffer ( Promega ) .
Luciferase activity was determined by using the Luciferase Assay System ( Promega ) and Lumat LB9501 ( Wal-lac , Gaithersburg MD ) .
pCMV-B-galactosidase ( CLON-TECH ) was used as an internal control for efficiency of transfection .
Luciferase activity was normalized based on B-galactosidase activity in the same well ; this is termed relative luciferase activity ( x axis in Fig .
3 ) .
In Vivo Studies of Tissue Factor Expression and Fibrin Deposition .
Homozygous Egr-1 knockout mice ( 12 , 13 ) or nontransgenic littermate controls were exposed to hypoxia by using an environmental chamber designed for small animals ( 5 ) .
After the indicated time in hypoxia , tissue was fixed in formalin and processed for immunohistochemistry as described ( 14 ) .
Immunoblotting for fibrin epitopes , using an antibody to fibrin y-y chain crosslinks ( 15 ) , and localization tissue factor antigen in tissue sections , by immunohistochemical techniques ( 6 ) , was performed as described .
Fibrin immunostaining was performed by using the same method and antibody prepared to fibrin y-y chain crosslinks .
RESULTS Role of Egr-1 in Hypoxia-Induced Tissue Factor Expression in Cultured Mononuclear Phagocytes and HeLa Cells .
Because hypoxic induction of tissue factor mRNA has been observed in a cultured mutant hepatoma cell line deficient in hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( 16 ) , implicating a mechanism independent of HIF-1 ( 17 ) , a novel pathway was likely to underlie oxygen deprivation-mediated regulation of tissue factor expression .
Tissue factor up-regulation occurred prominently in MPs in hypoxic lung , and human peripheral blood-derived mononuclear phagocytes in culture also showed enhanced tissue factor levels on exposure to hypoxia .
Up-regulation of tissue factor mRNA ( ~18-fold based on densitometry ) was observed in hypoxic MPs ( Fig .
14 ) as a result of , in large part , de novo transcription as shown by nuclear run-on analysis ( Fig .
1B ; ~15-fold increase in tissue factor transcripts ) .
To analyze further mechanisms of transcriptional activation , a cell system other than blood monocytes had to be identified , because human monocytes do not proliferate and established monocyte cell lines did not reproduc-ibly show hypoxia-mediated up-regulation of tissue factor .
HeLa cells subjected to oxygen deprivation displayed increased tissue factor mRNA , maximal within 4 hr ( Fig .
1C ) , principally reflecting increased transcription ( Fig .
1D ; ~10-fold increase in tissue factor ) .
Recent studies have highlighted a role for Egr-1 in vascular injury ( 18 , 19 ) , as well as the contribution of a trio of 12 bp overlapping Egr-1 and Spl DNA-binding sites in the SRR of the tissue factor promoter ( -111/+14 bp ) in regulation of tissue factor expression ( 9 ) .
Oligonucleotide probes spanning each of the Egr-1/Sp1 DNA-binding sites , termed R1 , R2 , and R3 ( 9 ) , were *P -labeled and employed in EMSA with nuclear extracts from hypoxic/normoxic HeLa cells and monocytes .
Rat MP and HeLa nuclear extracts ( data with HeLa cells are not shown ) from both normoxic and hypoxic cultures showed a strong constitutive band ( labeled Sp1 in Fig .
24 , lanes 2 and 3 ; results with the R2 probe are shown ) whose appearance was blocked by inclusion of excess unlabeled Sp1 probe ( lanes 6 and 7 ) , but not by Egr oligonucleotide ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Only hypoxic cultures showed a new gel-shift band ( Fig .
24 , lane 3 ; this hypoxia-inducible band is labeled Egr-1 ) whose appearance 8300 Medical Sciences : Yan et al .

Effect of hypoxia on tissue factor gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes ( 4 and B ) and HeLa cells ( C and D ) .
( 4 and C ) Northern analysis for tissue factor transcripts .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes cells , 4 ) or HeLa cells ( ~0.5 X 105 cells , C ) in serum-free medium were subjected to normoxia ( N ) or hypoxia ( H ; pO » ~ 12-14 torr ) for the indicated times ( HeLa ) or for 4 hr ( mononuclear phagocytes ) .
Northern analysis was performed by loading 30 ug/lane of total RNA and using *°P-labeled cDNA for human tissue factor ( Upper ) or human B-actin ( Lower ) .
FBS and PMA denote cultures exposed to fetal bovine serum ( 20 % ) or phorbol myristate acetate ( 50 ng/m1 ) , respectively , for 1 hr in each case .
( B and D ) Nuclear run-on analysis for the rate of tissue factor transcription .
Mononuclear phagocytes ( ~10 '' cells , B ) or HeLa cells ( ~10° cells , DD ) were subjected to normoxia or hypoxia ( as above ) for 4 hr , nuclei were harvested , labeled by incubation with [ « -*2P ] dUTP for 1 hr , the RNA was isolated , and the same amount of radioactivity was hybridized with cDNA probes for tissue factor or -actin , the latter already immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes .
Results shown are representative of a minimum of four experiments .
was blocked by excess unlabeled Egr probe ( Fig .
24 , lane 5 ) , but not by Sp1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
24 , lane 7 ) .
Because of the greater intensity of the proximal constitutive Spl bands relative to the inducible Egr band , it was difficult to accurately judge competition with unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide for Egr DNA-binding activity with probes containing overlapping Sp1 and Egr sites .
For this reason , experiments also were performed separately by using consensus Sp1 and Egr probes ( see below ) .
Competition experiments demonstrated specificity of the observed protein-DNA binding complexes , because excess unlabeled oligonucleotide probes corresponding to consensus sequences for AP-1 , HIF-1 , and NF-IL-6 had no effect on the observed gel-shift bands ( data not shown ) .
Similar results were obtained when nuclear extracts of hypoxic MPs and HeLa cells were studied with *°P-labeled R1 and R3 probes ( data not shown ) .
Because of these comparable observations with the two cell types , further in vitro studies were performed in the more conveniently manipulated HeLa cells .

EMSA of tissue factor promoter DNA-binding motifs : effect of hypoxia .
( 4 ) EMSA using R2 from the tissue factor promoter .
Rat mononuclear phagocytes ( ~10 '' , 4 ) were exposed to normoxia ( N ) or hypoxia ( H ; pO ~ 12-14 torr ) for 45 min , nuclear extracts were prepared , and EMSA was performed using *°P-labeled oligonucleotide for R2 ( -96/-66 bp ; ref .
9 ) .
Each lane received 10 ug/lane of total nuclear extract protein .
The arrows indicate bands corresponding to Egr and Sp1 ( 4 ) .
Note that the unlabeled lower band observed in lanes 2 , 3 , and 7 may represent Sp3 ( 38 ) .
A 100-fold excess of the indicated unlabeled ( cold ) oligonucleotide with a consensus sequence of Spl or Egr was added .
( B ) EMSA using consensus oligonucleotide probe Egr .
Nuclear extracts were harvested from normoxic/hypoxic HeLa cells and EMSA was performed with the indicated P-labeled oligonucleotide probe .
Excess unlabeled Sp1 , AP-1 , or Egr oligonucleotide was added to certain lanes , and either rabbit anti-Egr-1 IgG ( 1:5 and 1:50 dilution ) or nonimmune IgG ( 1:5 ) was added to other lanes .
( C ) EMSA using consensus oligonucleotide for Egr , as above , and nuclear extracts from normoxic/hypoxic murine lung .
Mice were subjected to hypoxia ( ~6 % oxygen ; ref .
6 ) for 45 min , lungs were rapidly harvested , and nuclear extracts were prepared .
EMSA was performed as above , and , where indicated , anti-Egr-1 IgG or nonimmune IgG ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was added .
( D ) ) EMSA using consensus oligonucleotide for Sp-1 and nuclear extracts from normoxic/hypoxic murine lung was performed using the same conditions as above ( +/+ , wild-type mice ; -/- , Egr-1 null mice ) .
Results shown are representative of a minimum of four experiments .
To facilitate analysis of the protein-DNA complexes binding to the R2 probe , EMSA was performed by using * > P-labeled consensus oligonucleotides for only Spl or Egr .
EMSA using Medical Sciences : Yan et al .
consensus Egr probe showed a gel-shift band in nuclear extracts from hypoxic ( Fig .
2B , lane 3 ) , but not from normoxic , HeLa cells ( Fig .
2B , lane 2 ) .
Addition of excess unlabeled Egr probe blocked appearance of the hypoxia-induced gel-shift band ( Fig .
2B , lane 4 ) , but oligonucleotides corresponding to Sp1 or AP-1 were without effect ( Fig .
2B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Inclusion of antibody to Egr-1 in the reaction mixture blocked appearance of the hypoxia-induced gel-shift band observed with the Egr probe , depending on the amount of antibody added ( Fig .
2B , lanes 7 and 8 ) , whereas nonimmune IgG was without effect ( Fig .
2B , lane 9 ) .
Consistent with these data , EMSA of nuclear extracts from hypoxic murine lung ( harvested within 45 min of oxygen deprivation ) similarly displayed an enhancement of DNA-binding activity for the Egr probe ( Fig .
2C , lanes 2 and 3 ) , and the latter gel-shift band disappeared on addition of antibody to Egr-1 , but not with nonimmune IgG ( Fig .
2C , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Quite different results were obtained when nuclear extracts from hypoxic cells and lung were evaluated for DNA-binding activity for the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide .
With *°P-Sp1 probe , a prominent band of equal intensity was observed with nuclear extracts from both normoxic and hypoxic HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
Gel-shift analysis of nuclear extracts from hypoxic wild-type murine lung using the Sp-1 probe showed no change in intensity of the band when comparing samples from hypoxic and normoxic tissue ( Fig .
2D , +/+ ) .
A similar pattern of Sp-1 DNA-binding activity in hypoxic and normoxic lung was shown in nuclear extracts from Egr-1 null mice ( Fig .
2D , -/- ) .
To better determine the role of Egr-1 in driving tissue factor transcription in HeLa cells subjected to hypoxia , transient transfection was performed with chimeric promoter-reporter constructs spanning the SRR ( -111/+14 bp ) ( Fig .
34 ) .
As an internal control for efficiency of transfection , cotransfection was performed with pCMV-B-galactosidase .
Results are shown as the fold-increase in luciferase activity normalized for B-galactosidase activity ( see Methods ) .
Increased expression of the luciferase reporter was observed in hypoxic cultures after transfection with wild-type SRR in which both Sp1 and Egr-1 sites were intact ( Fig .
34 ; ~6-fold ) , compared with normoxic controls .
A mutant construct in which all three Egr-1 sites in the SRR were inactivated showed no increase in luciferase activity when transfected cultures were exposed to hypoxia ( Fig .
34 ) .
Consistent with a central role for Sp1 in basal tissue factor expression ( 9 ) , mutational inactivation of all three Spl sites blocked both basal and hypoxia enhanceable expression of luciferase ( Fig .
34 ) .
Similarly , a construct in which both Sp1 and Egr-1 sites were inactivated ( Fig .
34 ) showed expression similar to that with the construct in which Sp1 was inactivated .
These data led us to further dissect the role of Egr-1 by making a construct composed of the Egr consensus DNA-binding motif , the basal thymidine kinase promoter ( -80/+18 ) , and luciferase .
Two constructs were prepared : pYSF60 , corresponding to wild-type Egr consensus site , and pYSF61 , corresponding to a mutationally inactivated Egr consensus site ( Fig .
3B ) .
Transient transfection of these constructs into HeLa cells demonstrated hypoxic enhancement of reporter expression only in the presence of the intact Egr DNA-binding site , but not with the mutationally inactivated Egr construct .
Role of Egr-1 in Pulmonary Tissue Factor Expression and Fibrin Deposition in a Murine Model of Hypoxia /Hypoxemia .
To move from an association of Egr-1 with enhanced tissue factor expression in hypoxia to a cause-effect relationship , we studied Egr-1 null mice ( 12 , 13 , 20 ) .
Our analysis was performed in Egr-1 null mice and nontransgenic controls , and representative results are shown .
Exposure of female Egr-1 knockout mice to hypoxia resulted in a severely blunted increase in tissue factor mRNA in lung : compared with an ~20-fold increase in tissue factor transcripts in wild-type mice subjected to hypoxia ( versus normoxic controls ) , there was only an ~2-fold increase in tissue factor Proc .

Hypoxia-inducible tissue factor expression results from transcriptional activation at Egr-1 sites .

Cultures were transfected with each of the indicated constructs by using the lipofectamine procedure ( GIBCO ) , and then cells were exposed to normoxia ( N ) or hypoxia ( H ) for 5 hr .
Luciferase and -galactosidase activity were then determined .
Relative luciferase activity is luciferase activity normalized for B-galactosidase activity .

mRNA in Egr-1 null mice ( Fig .
44 ) .
Abundant tissue factor antigen was present in lungs of wild-type mice subjected to hypoxia ( Fig .
4B , versus wild-type normoxic controls in Fig .
4C ) .
Immunohistologic studies were performed on animals to detect tissue factor or fibrin antigen ( see below ) by using Egr-1 null mice and nontransgenic littermates .
For each animal , sections from every lobe of one lung were analyzed ; sections in which there were pulmonary vessels of comparable size were compared , and representative results are shown .
Tissue factor antigen ( Fig .
4 D and F ) was colocalized with mononuclear phagocytes ( Fig .
4€E ; identified using the F4/80 antibody ) and smooth muscle cells ( Fig .
4G ; identified using antibody to smooth muscle -actin ) .
In contrast , tissue factor was virtually undetectable in lungs from hypoxic and normoxic Egr-1 null mice ( Fig .
4 H and J , respectively ) .
Consistent with a central role for hypoxia-induced tissue factor expression in fibrin formation in the vasculature ( 6 ) , immunostaining of hypoxic lung with antibody to y-y chain dimers ( 15 ) showed intravascular fibrin in samples from wild-type mice ( Fig .
54 ) , whereas there was no detectable fibrin in samples from normoxic wild-type controls ( Fig .
5B ) .
In contrast , no fibrin epitopes were observed in either hypoxic or normoxic Egr-1 null mice ( Fig .
5 C and D , respectively ) .
To more quantitatively assess fibrin deposition in lung , immunoblotting with antibody to y-y chain crosslinks was performed on lung tissue extracts ( 6 ) : a strong immunoreactive band was detected in samples from wild-type hypoxic mice , but only a faint band was seen in samples from normoxic controls ( Fig .
SE , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Only a very weak band corresponding to fibrin necoepitope was observed in either normoxic or hypoxic samples from Egr-1 null mice ( Fig .

Perturbation of mononuclear phagocytes in the oxygen-depleted environment causes expression of tissue factor , allowing coagulation to be initiated , and activated products of the procoagulant pathway accumulate in static portions of the vascular tree .
This biology of thrombosis is especially relevant to venous valve pockets , which are frequently subject to stasis and are a well known nidus for clot formation ( 1-4 ) .
A contribution of endothelium may be at the level of expression of chemotactic activity ; monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( JE/MCP-1 ) is expressed by hypoxic endothelial cells ( 21 ) .
Thus , we speculate that the biology of hypoxia-mediated thrombosis assigns monocytes a central role to effect a primordial response causing isolation of an ischemic area from the circulation by a protective fibrin clot .
In addition to providing insights into a key mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced thrombosis , our studies have demonstrated a pathophysiologically relevant model of hypoxia-associated gene regulation independent of HIF-1 ( 17 ) .
The role of Egr-1 in physiologic and pathophysiologic ( 22 ) processes has been clarified by observations in Egr-1 null mice ( 12 and 13 ) .
Whereas Egr-1 was postulated to be an essential factor in macrophage differentiation ( 23 ) and multiple other basic cellular homeostatic events ( 22 ) , based on in vitro studies , analysis of Egr-1 null mice has not borne out many of these predictions ( 12 , 13 , 20 ) .
Rather , the phenotype of Egr-1 knockout mice becomes evident only after environmental stress : female homozygote knockout mice are sterile because of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) - $ deficiency , an effect mediated at the level of LH- transcription ( 12 ) , and we have shown here that Egr-1 is necessary for tissue factor induction in the setting Medical Sciences : Yan et al .
of environmental oxygen deprivation .
The potential significance of Egr-1 activation in hypoxia concerns the range of potential target genes and cellular functions thereby stimulated by these gene products .
Of these , we previously have observed enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion mol-ecule-1 in hypoxemic vasculature ( 24 ) , where it could have an important role in arresting leukocytes in ischemic tissues .
These considerations suggest that there may be important contrasts between hypoxia-induced adaptive responses subject to regulation by HIF-1 ( 17 , 25 , 26 ) and those that we think to be under control of Egr-1 .
Many studies have shown that HIF-1 regulates expression of genes involved in the metabolic adjustment to oxygen deprivation [ glycolytic enzymes ( 27-30 ) and the noninsulin-dependent glucose transporter , GLUT ( 31 ) ] , angiogenesis ( vascular endothelial growth factor ; ref .
32 ) , and vasomotor control ( nitric-oxide synthase and heme oxygenase ; refs .
33 and 34 ) .
Egr-1-mediated gene expression appears to orchestrate thromobogenesis and , potentially , cell-cell interactions and inflammatory mechanisms ( 18 , 35-37 ) , suggesting activation of a distinct type of host response mechanisms in the hypoxemic milieu .
The range of Egr-1 target genes activated by hypoxia and their consequences for the host response to oxygen deprivation provide a new approach to the biology of thrombosis and effector mechanisms triggered in ischemia .
