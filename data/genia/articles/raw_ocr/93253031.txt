Francis Hospital and Medical Center , Hartford , Connecticut 06105 ; and §Department of Pediatrics , University of Connecticut Health Center , Farmington , Connecticut 06030 Abstract The precise molecular abnormalities that cause primary cortisol resistance have not been completely described .
In a subject with primary cortisol resistance we have observed glucocorticoid receptors ( hGR ) with a decreased affinity for dexamethasone .
We hypothesize that a mutation of the hGR glucocorticoid-binding domain is the cause of cortisol resistance .
Total RNA isolated from the index subject 's mononuclear leukocytes was used to produce first strand hGR cDNAs , and the entire hGR cDNA was amplified in segments and sequenced .
At nucleotide 2,317 we identified a homozygous A for G point mutation that predicts an isoleucine ( ATT ) for valine ( GTT ) substitution at amino acid 729 .
When the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were expressed in COS-1 cells and assayed for [ °H ] -Dexamathasone binding , the dissociation constants were 0.799+0.068 and 1.54+0.06 nM ( mean+SEM ) ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively .
When the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were expressed in CV-1 cells that were cotransfected with the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) gene , the hGR-Ile 729 conferred a fourfold decrease in apparent potency on dexamethasone stimulation of CAT activity .
The isoleucine for valine substitution at amino acid 729 impairs the function of the hGR and is the likely cause of primary cortisol resistance in this subject .

Abnormalities of the human glucocorticoid receptor ( hGR ) ' number ( 4 , 8 , 10 ) , affinity for DNA ( 5 ) , affinity for glucocorticoids ( 2 , 9 , 10 ) , and translocation to the nucleus ( 6 ) have been described .
The molecular basis for this disorder has been determined for one subject ( 11 ) but is generally un-known .
We recently described a 6-7/12-yr-old boy with primary cortisol resistance and isosex ual precocious pseudopuberty resulting from excess adrenal androgen secretion ( 9 ) .
Dexamethasone binding to hGR of intact fresh mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) revealed a K , two- to threefold greater than controls and normal binding capacity ( 9 ) .
The hGR is compartmenta-lized .
The two major functional domains are the DNA-binding domain , which is in the mid-region of the molecule , and the glucocorticoid-binding domain , which is at the carboxyl terminus ( 12-16 ) .
Since the ligand-binding affinity in this subject is decreased , we hypothesize that primary cortisol resistance results from a mutation of the glucocorticoid-binding domain of the hGR .
We now describe a point mutation of the hGR mRNA that predicts a change in the primary structure of the glucocorticoid-binding domain and alters hGR function .

First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from this RNA by standard methods ( 18 ) .
To prepare hGR cDNAs for the carboxyl half of the molecule , we used a 35-mer oligonucleotide primer complementary to nucleotides 2,599-2,634 , which are in the 3 ' untranslated region of the alpha form of the hGR cDNA ( 19 ) , to prime specific first-strand cDNA synthesis ( Table I and Fig .
1 ) .
A 35-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 1,260-1,294 was used to prime specific first-strand cDNA synthesis upstream of the middle of the molecule ( Table I and Fig .
1 ) .
In both cases 5 ug of total RNA was incubated for 60 min at 37°C with 2.5 ug 35-mer oligonucleotide in 50 Ll of buffer containing 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.3 ) , 75 mM KCI , 3 mM MgCl , , 10 mM DTT , 500 uM dNTPs , and 250 U MMuLV reverse transcriptase ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification of the hGR cDNA .
The primers and strategy for the PCR amplification of the hGR cDNA are shown in Table I and Fig .
1 .
The coding region of the carboxyl half of the molecule ( including the DNA-binding and glucocorticoid-binding domains ) was amplified with the template being the cDNA that had been prepared using the primer complementary to nucleotides 2,599-2,634 .
To PCR amplify the region coding for the glucocorticoid-binding domain , one tenth of the appropriate cDNA synthesis reaction ( 5 ul ) was mixed with 12.5 pmol each of 25-mer oligonucleotides GluR4 and GluR3 ' ( Table I and Fig .
1 ) , which flanked a 976-bp region of the hGR cDNA coding for the glucocorticoid-binding domain ( Fig .
2 4 ) .
The reaction was brought to 100 ul , with the final buffer containing 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.3 ) , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.01 % gelatin , 200 aM dNTPs , and 2.5 U Taq polymerase ( 20 ) .
30 cycles of heating to 94°C for 1 min , cooling to 50°C for 1 min , and heating to 72°C for 3.5 min were performed on a thermal cycler ( model 2600 ; Perkin-Elmer Cetus In-struments , Norwalk , CT ) with a 7-min incubation at 72°C after the 30th cycle .
The successful amplification of a specific 976-bp fragment was determined by electrophoresis of a 10-4l aliquot of the reaction on a 5 % TBE-polyacrylamide gel ( 21 ) and staining with ethidium bromide .
Alternatively , a 31 1-bp fragment of hGR cDNA was PCR ampli- fied from 10 Ll of first-strand hGR cDNA by the above methods using oligonucleotides GluR 10 and GluR3 ( Table I and Fig .
1 ) .
To amplify the region that codes for the hGR DNA-binding domain , a 506-bp fragment of the hGR cDNA was PCR amplified from 10 ul of the appropriate first-strand hGR cDNA by the above methods using oligonucleotides GluR9 and GluR 1 1 ( Table I and Fig .
1 ) .
To amplify the remainder of the molecule , the cDNA prepared with the primer complementary to nucleotides 1,260-1,294 was used as the template .
Using GluR7 , GluR13 , and the PCR reagents described above , an 827-bp DNA fragment was amplified with the following conditions : 30 cycles of heating to 94°C for l min , cooling to 50°C for I min , and heating to 72°C for 3.5 min .
Using GluR5 , GluR6 , and the PCR reagents and conditions described above , a 528-bp DNA fragment that included the 5 ' untranslated region was amplified .
3 xl of this reaction was reamplified using primers GluR14 and GluR6 and the same reaction conditions to produce a 502-bp fragment .
GluR 14 introduces a new Tag ] restriction enzyme site at position 67 by substituting an A for G at position 69 .
This site is used for subcloning .
DNA sequencing .
The amplified 976-bp fragment carrying the coding region for the glucocorticoid-binding domain was isolated from the PCR mixture by electroelution ( 21 ) , cleaved with Taq !

site of pBS SK+ ( Strata-gene , Inc. , La Jolla , CA ) .
The amplified 31 -bp fragment was isolated by electroelution , cleaved with Nsil ( nucleotide 2,309 ) and Tagl ( nucleotide 2,500 ) , and ligated into the PstI and Accel sites of pBS SK+ .
The 506-bp fragment carrying the region coding for the DNA-binding domain was cleaved with Styl ( nucleotide 1,233 ) and EcoRI ( nucleotide 1,628 ) and ligated into the Xbal and EcoRI sites of pBS SK+ .
The amplified 827-bp fragment was cleaved with HindIII ( nucleotides 490 and 1,044 ) and the resultant fragment ligated into pBS SK+ cleaved with HindIII .
This fragment was also cut with BstYI ( nucleotides 915 and 1,237 ) and ligated into pBS SK+ cleaved with BamHI .
The 502-bp fragment was cleaved with Taql ( nucleotides 67 and 526 ) and ligated into pBS SK+ cleaved with Accel .
The recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli .
Recombinant plasmid DNAs were isolated from single-banded CsCI preparations of single recombinant bacterial colonies and sequenced by the dideoxy method ( 22 ) , using [ S ] dATP and the universal primer , T3 primer , and internal primers .
Where indicated , the 31 1-bp PCR reactions ( 90 ul ) were precipitated twice with ammonium acetate and ethanol and sequenced directly using ~50 ng ( 2 x 10° cpm ) of a [ P ] dCTP-labeled internal hGR-specific oligonucleotide ( PCRS4 , Fig .

Strategy for detecting the A for G substitution at nucleotide 2,317 in genomic DNA .
The A for G substitution at hGR cDNA nucleotide 2317 ( underlined ) is near the border of the ninth exon and the H intron and creates a new HphI site in the genomic DNA .
The appropriate regions of both the wild-type and the mutant sequences are shown .
The upstream primer ( RE2 ) used for PCR amplifying this region of the genomic DNA is identical to the wild-type sequence except for a C that is substituted for a T at the position indicated by a box .
This substitution creates a new restriction site in the resultant fragment when the wild-type genomic DNA is amplified but not when the mutant genomic DNA is amplified .
The resultant fragment from PCR amplification of the wild-type genomic DNA contains the BslI ( CCNNNNN/NNGG ) restriction site , but not the HphI site .
The resultant fragment from PCR amplification of the mutant genomic DNA contains the Hphl ( GGTGANNNNNNNN/ ) restriction site , but not the BslI site .
The uncut PCR amplified fragment is 96 bp when either the wild-type or mutant genomic DNA is used as the template .
Cleavage of the fragment amplified from the wild-type genomic DNA with BslI yields a 72-bp fragment , and cleavage of the fragment amplified from the mutant genomic DNA with Hphl yields a 60-bp fragment .
quenced for the patient , his mother , and the two controls , and at least two independent PCR reactions were sequenced from each of the four subjects directly .
Sequence was compared with the published sequence of the hGR cDNA ( 19 ) .
Analysis of genomic DNA .
The genomic DNA was isolated from MNL of the index subject , his mother , and 20 unaffected normal controls by the method of Gross-Bellard et al .
( 23 ) .
This DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of the region of the genomic DNA carrying the A for G substitution at cDNA nucleotide position 2,317 .
Fig .
2 shows the sequence of the intron-exon junction ( 24 ) , the selection of the PCR primers , and the strategy for analyzing the genomic DNA for the hGR cDNA mutation at position 2,317 .
This mutation introduces a new Hph ] I cleavage site not present in the wild-type DNA .
Primer RE2 carries single-base mismatch to create a Bsl I restriction site in the wild-type genome but not in the genome of the index subject .
50 ng of genomic DNA was mixed with 12.5 pmol each of the primers ( Table I and Fig .
2 ) .
The reaction was brought to 100 gl with the final buffer containing 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.3 ) , 1.5 mM MgC ) ; , 0.01 % gelatin , 200 uM dNTPs , and 2.5 U Taq polymerase ( 20 ) .
30 cycles of heating to 94°C for 1 min , cooling to 51°C for 0.75 min , and heating to 72°C for 1.5 min with a 4-min incubation at 72°C after the 30th cycle were used to amplify a 96-bp fragment carrying the region of interest .
This PCR product was precipitated with 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 100 % ethanol and divided into three equal aliquots ; one was left uncut , one was cut overnight with 5 U BslI ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) , and one was cut overnight with 4 U of HphI ( New England Biolabs } .
Reaction conditions were according to the specifications of 1920 the manufacturer .
The products were separated on a 6 % TBE-polyacrylamide minigel and stained with ethidium bromide .
Preparation of expression vectors .
An expression vector carrying the identified mutation of the hGR cDNA was prepared from the an expression vector linking the RSV LTR to full length wild-type hGR cDNA ( pRShGRa ) , which was graciously provided by Dr. Stanley M. Hollenberg ( The Salk Institute , San Diego , CA ; reference 15 ) .
The 976-bp PCR-amplified cDNA coding for the entire glucocorticoid-binding domain was cleaved with Nsi1 ( nucleotide 2,309 ) and Aval ( 2,380 ) to generate a 72-bp fragment containing the A for G substitution at nucleotide 2,317 .
This was ligated into the corresponding Nsil and Aval sites of the BstXI-Xhol fragment of the pRShGRa , which had been subcloned into pBS SK+ .
The Clal-Xhol fragment of this construct was ligated into the corresponding Clal and Xhol sites of the pRShGRa to create an expression vector for the mutant hGR-Ile 729 .
This vector was sequenced in its entirety to be sure that no other mutations had been introduced inadvertently .
The expression vector , pMTVCAT , which contains the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat ( MTV ) fused to the cDNA for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) , was graciously provided by Dr. Stanley Hollenberg .
Transfection of mammalian cells .
To investigate the ligand-binding properties of wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 , these receptors were expressed in COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran transfection method ( 15 ) .
COS-1 cells were grown at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS in an atmosphere of 5 % CO ; and 95 % air to a density of 50 % in 10-cm culture dishes .
Media was aspirated , cells were washed once with PBS , and refed with 4 ml of DMEM containing 10 % NuSerum ( Collaborative Research , Bedford , MA ) .
The expression vectors , which had been purified using two CsCI-EtBr equilibrium gradients , were dissolved in Tris-buffered saline at a concentration of 0.25 ug/ul , and 40 « l of this solution was mixed with 80 l of 10 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in Tris-buffered saline and added dropwise to each plate of COS-1 cells .
After a 4-h incubation at 37°C , the medium was aspirated from the plates , and the cells were shocked by incubating with 5 ml of 10 % DMSO in PBS for 1 min at 20°C .
The DMSO solution was aspirated .
The cells were washed with 5 ml of PBS , and 10 ml of complete medium was added to each plate .
After being incubated for 48 h , the cells were harvested , lysed by freezing and thawing in TEDGM ( 10 mM Tris , 1.5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 3 % glycerol , and 10 mM sodium molybdate ) , centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 min at 4°C , and the supernatant , which had a final protein concentration of ~2-5 mg/ml , was assayed for dexamethasone binding .
To investigate the ability of the wild-type hGR and mutant hGR-Ile 729 to stimulate gene transcription , the expression vector for each receptor was cotransfected with pMTVCAT into CV-1 cells by the calcium phosphate method ( 15 ) .
CV-1 cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10 % FCS at 37°C in 10-cm plates and split 24 h before transfection .
For each plate 10 ug of pMTVCAT and the expression vector for the normal or mutant hGR were dissolved in 450 ul sterile water and combined with 50 gl 2.5 M CaCl ; .
This solution was then added to 500 Ll of 2 % Hepes-buffered saline , allowed to precipitate for 20 min at 20°C , and distributed evenly over a 10-cm plate of cells .
After 6 h the medium was aspirated .
The cells were shocked with 2 ml of 10 % DMSO in PBS for 3 min at 20°C , washed twice with 5 ml PBS , and fed with 10 ml of complete medium containing the indicated concentration of dexamethasone .
Complete medium containing dexamethasone at the indicated concentrations was changed at 24 h. The cells were harvested at 48 h , lysed by freezing and thawing in 0.25 M Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , and assayed for CAT activity ( 25 ) .
Functional assays of expressed glucocorticoid receptors .
Specific binding of [ °H ] Dex to wild-type and mutant hGR expressed in COS-1 cells was determined by the dextran-coated charcoal method ( 26 ) .
About 200 ug of cytosolic protein was incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml TEDGM buffer with [ °H ] Dex at concentrations from 0.1 to 25 nM at 4°C for 16 h in the absence and presence of a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled dexamethasone .
To determine the K , of the hGR for cortisol , binding was performed at a concentration of [ °H ] Dex equal to its Malchoff , Brufsky , Reardon , McDermott , Javier , Bergh , Rowe , and Malchoff K , , and cortisol concentrations from 3 to 1,000 nM .
To separate bound from free ligand , 50 gl of a solution containing 1 % charcoal and 0.01 % dextran was mixed with the binding reaction and , after 10 min at 4°C , the mixture was centrifuged for 2 min on a microcentrifuge .
The super-natant was assayed on a liquid-scintillation counter .
Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding and the results were analyzed by Scatchard analysis .
The K , for cortisol was calculated from the concentration of cortisol required to inhibit [ +H ] Dex binding by 50 % and equilibrium binding equations for a competitive inhibitor ( 27 ) .
CAT activity was measured by the diffusion method of Eastman ( 25 ) .
The final reaction mixture contains 125 mM Tris ( pH = 7.8 ) , 1.25 mM chloramphenicol , and 0.28 gM acetyl CoA ( 1.4 Ci/mmol ! )
in a volume of 250 Ll .
The cytosols from three separate transfection experiments were treated with the indicated concentrations of dexamethasone in triplicate and assayed .
Results Fig .
3 shows the Scatchard analysis of the binding of [ +H JDex to intact MNL hGR of the mother of the index subject .
The normal range ( mean+2 SD ) for the K , is 1.4-3.4 nM , and the normal range for maximum binding capacity is 5.3-7.7 fmol / 10° cells .
The K , derived for the index subject and his mother were 6.4+0.8 ( mean+SEM ; n = 4 ) and 6.2+1.2 nM ( mean+SEM ; n = 3 ) , respectively .
The maximum binding capacities are 6.5+0.5 and 5.7+0.7 fmol / 10® cells , respectively .
The dissociation constants of both the index subject and his mother were significantly different from normal ( P < 0.01 ) , and the maximum binding capacities were within the normal range .
The dissociation constants of the index subject and his mother were not significantly different from each other .
Using the PCR , we amplified in four overlapping segments the entire cDNA coding for the hGR from the index subject and from two unrelated and unaffected controls .
The 976-bp fragment carried the coding region for the entire glucocorticoid-binding domain and the 506-bp fragment carried the coding region for the entire DNA-binding domain .
All samples demonstrated a specific DNA fragment of appropriate molecular weight after amplification .
All four fragments were subcloned and entirely sequenced .
Sequencing of the index subject 's hGR cDNA fragment demonstrated two A for G substitutions not present in a cloned 4 Figure 3 .
Scatchard analysis of [ +H ] Dex binding to hGR of intact MNL from the mother of the index subject .
Binding of [ °H ] Dex to the hGR of intact MNL obtained from the mother of the index subject and 12 unrelated control subjects was determined as described in Methods .
The Scatchard analysis of these results is shown .
The binding of the mother 's MNL hGR is represented by the solid squares .
The shaded area represents the 95 % confidence limits ( mean+2 SD ) of the control binding .
The 95 % confidence intervals of the slopes are reported in the results .
Bound Free 0 0 4 8 [ °H ] Dexamethasone Bound cells ) hGR cDNA ( 19 ) .
The A for G substitution at nucleotide 1,011 was found in all eight clones from the index subject and changes the codon for amino acid 293 from AAG to AAA .
Both these codons predict a lysine in this position in the final protein sequence .
Therefore , this substitution is not expected to change the amino acid sequence of the hGR .
A second A for G substitution of the index subject 's hGR cDNA was identified at nucleotide 2,317 ( Fig .
4 ) .
This alteration was present in nine of nine independent pBS-hGR recombinant plasmids .
In addition , the A at position 2,317 was the only nucleotide present in directly sequenced PCR products from the index subject .
The mutation was not present in nine of nine pBS-hGR recombinant plasmids sequenced from the two controls ( Fig .
4 ) , both of which demonstrated the normal G at this position .
The A for G substitution at position 2,317 predicts an alteration in codon 729 of the hGR cDNA from GTT to ATT .
This would change amino acid 729 from valine to isoleucine when the mRNA is expressed as protein .
No other mutations were found .
We next PCR-amplified a 311-bp fragment of the hGR cDNA from the mother of the index subject and a normal control .
This cDNA fragment was selected to include the site of the mutation at position 2,317 .
The mother 's cDNA was found to have both a G and an A at position 2,317 ( Fig .
4 ) .
The A was present in 4 of 10 recombinant pBS-hGR plasmids , and the G was present in the remaining 6 recombinant pBS-hGR plasmids .
In addition , the mother 's cDNA was found to have a G/A doublet at position 2,317 when the 311-bp hGR cDNA fragment was directly sequenced after PCR amplification .
The mutation was not present in seven of seven pBS-hGR recombinant plasmids sequenced from the unaffected controls .
Fig .
5 is an example of the restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified genomic DNA from the index subject and one normal control .
In both cases a 96-bp fragment is obtained from the PCR amplification .
The fragment amplified from the index subject is cut completely by HphI to yield a 60-bp fragment , but this fragment is not cut by BslI .
This demonstrates that his genomic DNA is homozygous for the A for G substitution at cDNA nucleotide 2,317 , which creates a new HphlI site and causes a loss of the BslI site .
The fragment amplified from the control subject is cut completely by BslI to yield a 72-bp fragment , but this fragment is not cut by HphlI .
Analysis of genomic DNA from 20 unrelated controls gave this same result .
Therefore , both alleles of each control genomic DNA have a G at nucleotide 2,317 , not an A .
Not shown is the fragment amplified from the mother of the index subject , which is cut partially by both enzymes , indicating that she is heterozygous and carries a copy of both the mutant and wild-type alleles .
The expression vector for the hGR-Ile 729 was prepared as described in the Methods section , and the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were expressed in tissue culture .
Fig .
6 is an example of the Scatchard analysis of [ °H ] Dex binding to the wild-type hGR and mutant hGR-lIle 729 that had been expressed in COS-1 cells .
It illustrates the decreased affinity of hGR Ile-729 for [ °H ] Dex .
The binding analysis was performed in duplicate on the cytosols from four separate transfection experiments .
The dissociation constants for the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were 0.799+0.068 and 1.54+0.06 nM ( mean+SEM , n = 4 , P < 0.01 ) , respectively .

COS-1 cells were transfected with the wild-type hGR or hGR-Ile 729 expression vector using the DEAE-dextran method , and the cytosol was assayed for [ °H ] Dex binding .
Cytosol from control COS-1 cells transfected with pBS KS+ DNA does not bind [ °H ] Dex , indicating an absence of hGR in COS-1 cells .
The results shown are of a single experiment performed in duplicate .
Four separate transfection experiments using four different transfection products for both the hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were assayed in duplicate and the apparent dissociation constants were 0.799+0.068 and 1.54+0.06 nM ( mean+SEM ) ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively .

This mutation does not predict a change in the amino acid sequence of the hGR and therefore is not expected to cause cortisol resistance .
The entire hGR cDNA was sequenced and no other mutations were found .
The evidence in this manuscript supports the hypothesis that the mutation at nucleotide 2,317 is the cause of decreased dexamethasone-binding affinity and subsequently primary cortisol resistance in the index subject .
The studies of [ °H ] Dex binding to the hGR of the intact MNL shows an affinity abnormality of the glucocorticoid receptor from both the index subject and his mother .
These results suggest that cortisol resistance is an inherited defect and has not arisen as a new mutation in the index subject .
Since the affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor is affected , an abnormality in the glucocorticoid-binding domain of the index subject is expected .
The G to A missense point mutation at nucleotide 2,317 was not an artifact of our reverse transcription and /or amplification procedures , since it was found in two family members and not in normal controls .
Restriction enzyme analysis of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the index subject , his mother , and normal controls provides further evidence that the mutation is not an artifact of our procedures .
These results demonstrate the mutation in the index subject and his mother in a specific and sensitive assay of genomic DNA .
The mutation was not found in 20 unrelated controls .
It is likely that the index subject is homozygous for the mutation at nucleotide 2,317 .
The only nucleotide found at position 2,317 of his hGR cDNA was an A , and the parents of the index subject are believed to be first cousins .
In addition , analysis of the genomic DNA supports the conclusion , since the DNA fragment that was amplified from genomic DNA was cleaved by HphlI , and not BslI .
This mutation is apparently heterozygous in the mother , since approximately half of her hGR cDNA clones had a G at position 2,317 , and half had an A .
The analysis of the genomic DNA also supports this conclusion , since the amplified DNA could be partially cut by both restriction enzymes .
The father was not available for analysis but is likely to have contributed the second mutant allele to the index subject .
He could have contributed a nonexpressed or null allele to the index subject .
However , this possibility is unlikely in light of the normal receptor-binding capacity of the index subject 's hGR , which implies a normal amount of receptor protein ( 9 ) .
Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that hGR-Ile 729 is the cause of primary cortisol resistance in the index subject .
First , the location of the mutation in the glucocorticoid-binding domain predicts that the receptor will have a decreased affinity for dexamethasone , as we had observed in the MNL hGR of the index subject .
In vitro experiments with transfected cloned animal and human hGR cDNAs have demonstrated that the terminal 250 amino acids of the receptor are responsible for the glucocorticoid-binding activity , which can be altered by single amino acid changes ( 13-15 , 28 ) .
Since the identified mutation is in the glucocorticoid-binding domain as expected , it is likely to be responsible for the decreased dexamethasone affinity of the hGR .
Second , no other mutation that predicts a change in the amino acid sequence of the hGR was found .
Third , the functional activities of the hGR-Ile 729 receptor expressed in tissue culture were very similar to those observed in vivo .
When expressed in mammalian cells the hGR-Ile 729 is functionally abnormal .
The dissociation constant for [ °H ] Dex is about twice normal .
This corresponds well with the two- to threefold increase in dissociation constant of the native MNL hGR of the index subject ( 9 ) .
The fourfold decrease in the apparent potency of dexamethasone to stimulate hGR-mediated gene transcription corresponds well with the in vivo response of ACTH to dexamethasone .
A daily dose of 4 mg of dexamethasone was required to decrease the serum cortisol concentration to < 140 nmol/liter ( 5 ug/dl ) in the index subject ( 9 ) .
This is about five times as much as is nor DNA _ Glucocorticoid Binding Binding `` ah .

Glucocorticoid Receptor Mutation __ 1923 mally expected to produce the same effect .
Fourth , similar findings have been demonstrated in other disorders of steroid hormone resistance .
In another kindred with primary cortisol resistance , a single amino acid change of the glucocorticoid-binding domain causes cortisol resistance ( 11 ) .
In addition , single amino acid alterations of the human androgen receptor ( 29 ) and human thyroid hormone receptor ( 30 ) cause end organ resistance syndromes to each of these hormones .
Fifth , studies of androgen-resistance syndromes have identified two regions of the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain that frequently carry mutations in subjects with decreased androgen receptor affinity for testosterone and subsequent androgen resistance ( 31 ) .
The mutation that we suspect to cause cortisol resistance is located in a region of the glucocorticoid-binding domain analogous to one of these two regions of the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain .
As in the androgen-resistance model , a mutation in this region of the glucocorticoid-binding domain causes hormone resistance by altering the receptor affinity for its ligand .
Sixth , the mother of the index subject is heterozygous for the mutation that the index subject is apparently homozygous .
Therefore , it is expected that she would be less clinically affected than the index subject .
Indeed , this is the case , since she has no hirsutism , infertility , or other clinical evidence of androgen excess .
Taken together these six lines of evidence strongly support the hypothesis that an A for G substitution at nucleotide 2,317 is responsible for the syndrome of primary cortisol resistance in the index subject .
A mutation causing primary cortisol resistance has been reported in one other kindred .
This mutation was at a different position in the glucocorticoid-binding domain and also was associated with a decreased hGR affinity for glucocorticoids .
It was homozygous in the index subject and heterozygous in a family member who was less affected clinically ( 10 ) .
Interest-ingly , the mutation reported here is biochemically more conservative than most others that have been reported to cause cortisol resistance or other syndromes of steroid hormone resistance ( 11 , 29 , 30 ) .
This very conservative substitution of a neutral isoleucine for a neutral valine produces a surprisingly large change in receptor affinity for glucocorticoids and a clinical syndrome with cortisol resistance that is seemingly greater than anticipated from the change in dexamethasone binding .
It should be noted that this is not complete resistance , since it can be overcome by large amounts of exogenous glucocorticoids ( 9 ) .
We and others have proposed that complete resistance may be incompatible with life ( 32 ) .
There are two possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between the dexamethasone-binding affinity abnormality and the clinical abnormalities of the index subject ( 9 ) .
First , cortisol , the naturally occurring glucocorticoid , may bind less effectively to the mutant receptor than dexamethasone .
Second , the mutant receptor may have more abnormal functions than just ligand binding .
These possibilities are not mutually exclusive , and there is some evidence for both .
The ratio of dissociation constants of the mutant receptor to that of the wild-type receptor is 1.9 for dexamethasone and 2.9 for cortisol .
This indicates that the binding of the natural ligand is affected to a greater degree than binding of dexamethasone , a more potent glucocorticoid agonist .
Therefore , the dexamethasone-binding studies may not accurately predict the magnitude of the clinical abnormalities , since cortisol is the naturally occurring glucocorticoid .
It should also be noted that the valine at amino acid position 729 is present 1924 throughout evolution .
Mouse ( 13 ) , rat ( 33 ) , and new world monkey ( 34 ) glucocorticoid receptors all normally contain a valine at the position equivalent to residue 729 of the human receptor .
Thus , this amino acid may serve a key function in the mechanism of hGR action .
Isoleucine has a slightly more bulky side chain than valine , and this may hinder glucocorticoid binding to the receptor .
It has also been suggested that this region of the hGR may be important in receptor dimerization , which may promote hGR binding to the glucocorticoid regulatory elements ( 35 ) .
This mutation may interfere with dimerization , thereby inhibiting binding of the activated receptor to the DNA and contributing further to the clinical expression of cortisol resistance .
It is attractive to hypothesize that this amino acid is bifunctional , since this may help to explain the apparent discrepancy between alterations in binding affinity of dexamethasone and the apparent potency of dexamethasone to stimulate gene transcription ; the former is altered twofold whereas the latter is altered fourfold .
The results presented here do not explain why the dissociation constant of the MNL hGR from both the index subject and his mother are equal .
It is possible that the binding assay is not sensitive enough to detect subtle differences .
If the mutant and wild-type hGR bind independently , then a slightly curved Scatchard analysis is predicted .
However , our visual analysis of the predicted Scatchard curve indicates that , with the sensitivity of the current binding assay , such a curve would be impossible to distinguished from a straight line .
Alternatively , there may be unexpected interactions between receptors that influences their apparent binding affinities .
In summary , we have demonstrated an inherited point missense mutation of the hGR glucocorticoid-binding domain in a subject with primary cortisol resistance .
This mutation was identified by sequencing cDNA prepared from mRNA and was subsequently demonstrated to be present in genomic DNA .
This conservative mutation decreases the affinity of the expressed glucocorticoid receptor for glucocorticoids and impairs its ability to stimulate gene transcription .
The magnitude of the changes observed in vitro in these studies are very similar to the magnitude of the changes observed previously in the patient .
Taken together these results strongly support the hypothesis that homozygosity for this mutation causes the clinical and biochemical phenotype of primary cortisol resistance in the kindred under study .
These studies also suggest that Val 729 of the hGR is critical for its normal function .
