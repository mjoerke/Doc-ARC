Oncogene ( 1998 ) 16 , 1553-1560 © 1998 Stockton Press All rights reserved 0950-9232/98 $ 12.00 Human normal peripheral blood B-lymphocytes are deficient in DNA-dependent protein kinase activity due to the expression of a variant form of the Ku86 protein Catherine Muller , Caroline Dusseau , Patrick Calsou and Bernard Salles Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale ( CNRS , UPR 9062 ) 205 route de Narbonne , 31077 Toulouse cedex , France The heterodimeric Ku protein , which comprises a 86 kDa ( Ku86 ) amd a 70 kDa ( Ku70 ) subunits , is an abundant nuclear DNA-binding protein which binds in vitro to DNA termini without sequence specificity .
Ku is the DNA-targeting component of the large catalytic sub-unit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex ( DNA-PK , ; ) , that plays a critical role in mammalian double-strand break repair and lymphoid V ( D ) J recombination .
By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we demonstrated that in addition to the major Ku DNA complex usually detected in cell line extracts , a second complex with faster electrophoretic mobility was observed in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) extracts .
The presence of this faster migrating complex was restricted to B cells among the circulating lymphocyte population .
Western blot analysis revealed that B cells express a variant form of the Ku86 protein with an apparent molecular weight of 69 kDa , and not the 86 kDa- full-length protein .
Although the heterodimer Ku70/variant-Ku86 binds to DNA-ends , this altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic component of the complex , DNA-PKcs , which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA-PK activity in B cells , These data provide a molecular basis for the increased sensitivity of B cells to ionizing radiation and identify a new mechanism of regulation of DNA-PK activity that operates in vivo .
Keywords : DNA-PK ; Ku autoantigen ; B-lymphocytes ; V ( D ) J recombination Introduction Ku protein was originally identified as an autoantigen recognized by sera from patients with autoimmune diseases ( Minori et al. , 1981 ) .
Ku antigen was purified by immunoaffinity and shown to be a heterodimer consisting of 86 kDa ( Ku86 ) and 70 kDa ( Ku70 ) subunits ( Francoeur et al. , 1986 ; Minori and Hardin , 1986 ) .
Biochemical analyses of Ku demonstrated that it bound in vitro to DNA termini or other discontinuities in the DNA structure without apparent sequence specificity ( Minori and Hardin , 1986 ; Blier et al. , 1993 ; Falzon et al. , 1993 ) .
Ku has also been shown to possess DNA-dependent ATPase ( Cao et al. , 1994 ) and Correspondence : B Salles Received 27 August 1997 ; revised 24 October 1997 ; accepted 24 October 1997 helicase ( Tuteja et al. , 1994 ) activities .
Lastly , Ku has also been reported to be capable of sequence-specific binding within the promoter elements of genes ( Griffin et al. , 1996 ) .
Taken together , these biochemical properties have suggested a role for Ku in DNA metabolic processes such as recombination , repair , replication and/or transcription .
It is now established that Ku is the DNA-targetting component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase ( DNA-PK ) complex .
DNA-PK consists of the heterodimeric Ku protein and a large catalytic subunit ( DNA PKs ) , a 460 kDa serine/threonine kinase which belongs to the phosphatidyl ( PT ) -3 kinase ( p110 ) family ( Hartley et al. , 1995 ) .
DNA-PKcs is recruited to DNA by Ku binding ( Gottlieb and Jackson , 1993 ) and then acquires the capacity , at least in vitro , to phosphorylate many DNA-bound proteins in the vicinity ( Anderson et al. , 1994 ) .
Recently , a series of mutational and biochemical experiments have identified DNA-PK as a crucial component of the mammalian double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) repair apparatus .
Indeed , cell mutants with a defective Ku86 ( CHO xrs cells ) are sensitive to ionizing radiation ( IR® ) due to a decreased ability to repair DSBs ( for review see Jeggo , 1997 ) .
In xrs cells , a direct consequence of the Ku defect is a concomitant deficiency in the kinase activity of DNA-PK ( Finnie et al. , 1995 ) indicating that Ku DNA-binding represents the predominant , if only , mechanism for DNA-PK activation .
Similarly , in the rodent scid and V-3 mutants , the loss of DNA-PK , , ( Blunt et al. , 1995 ; Peterson et al. , 1995 ; Blunt et al. , 1996 ; Danska et al. , 1996 ) confers IR®° and a deficiency in DNA DSBs repair ( Biederman et a/. , 1991 ; Hendrickson et a/. , 1991 ) .
In addition to IR® , the observed defect in DNA DSB repair alters efficient joining of V ( D ) J recombination intermediates that result in a profound immunodeficiency .
The V ( D ) J recombination is a lymphoid and site-specific DNA recombination process that assembles the non contiguous genomic segments that encode the Variable ( V ) , Diversity ( D ) , and Joining ( J ) elements of immunoglo-bulin and T cell receptor genes ( reviewed in Weaver , 1995 ) .
Thus , mice homozygous for the murine severe combined immune deficiency ( seid ) mutation lack mature T- and B-lymphocytes , due to a defect in V ( D ) J recombination coding junction - formation ( Schuller et al. , 1986 ) .
Lastly , knock-out mice for Ku86 have been generated and , as expected , these mice have a profound immunodeficiency ( Zhu et al. , 1996 ) .
Although its precise role remains largely unknown , these results clearly identified DNA-PK as an essential component of the mammalian DNA repair apparatus that rejoin damage-induced , as well as V ( D ) J recombination intermediates , DSBs .
Negative regulation of DNA-PK activity in normal B-lymphocytes C Muller et al 1554 In human cell lines , Ku represents the major double-strand DNA end binding protein as detected by band shift experiments and its expression does not appear to be regulated within cell types ( Finnie et al. , 1996 and our unpublished results ) .
In addition , in human lymphoblastoid cell lines , no changes in the levels of Ku polypeptides have been detected following treatment with ionizing radiation ( Jongmans et al. , 1996 ) .
All these results lead to the idea that Ku activity is present at high constitutive levels in human cells .
Despite many studies performed with established cell lines , little is known about Ku activity in normal fresh human cells and tissues .
Indeed , only a few studies of Ku gene expression have been reported to date ( Yaneva and Jhiang , 1991 ; Cai et al. , 1994 ) .
Regarding the major role of the Ku protein in DSBs repair , this appears to be an important question .
In an attempt to explore this issue , we have chosen to study Ku function in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) obtained from healthy donors .
Our results show , for the first time , that DNA-PK activity is regulated in vivo , through the expression of a variant form of the Ku86 protein in human normal B cells .
Results Detection of an altered form of the Ku heterdomer in peripheral blood lymphocytes In human cell lines , Ku DNA-ends binding ( DEB ) activity can be easily detected by using dsDNA fragments in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) ( Zhang and Yanera , 1992 ) .
As shown in Figure 1 , in the human cell lines AHH1 and Hela , at least three complexes of different mobility were observed ( A , A ' and A '' ) .
Ku has the ability to translocate internally on DNA allowing another Ku heterodimer to bind to free DNA ends ( deVries et al. , 1989 ) .
Thus , the increase in complex A ' and A '' formation in association with increased protein concentration is likely to correspond to the binding of multiple Ku heterodimers to the same DNA-probe as previously described ( Zhang and Yaneva , 1992 ) .
When PBL extracts were considered , the results consistently showed two features independent of the origin of the samples tested ( shown for three different donors in Figure 1 ) .
Firstly , DEB activity appears lower in PBL extracts than the one observed for established cell lines .
Secondly , in addition to the major complex usually detected in cell lines ( complex A ) , a second complex with faster electrophoretic mobility ( complex B ) was observed in PBL extracts .
In PBL , the signal due to these two different complexes appeared almost identical .
This profile of DEB activity was detected in all the PBL extracts tested in our laboratory ( obtained to date from six different healthy donors ) .
In our hands , this unusual pattern of DEB activity observed in PBL was not detected in a variety of transformed cell lines of human or rodent origin tested ( data not shown ) .
The pattern of DEB activity observed in PBL suggests either that an additional protein , expressed only in this cell population , is able to recognize double-stranded DNA-ends or that the Ku heterodimer is present in an altered form in PBL extracts .
To test these two Extracts 2 ug 4 ug PBL PBL A H 1° 2 3 A Ho10 2 3 « * # “ an : A '' - > j a - > < < # # < < 0 mike tig t n A -__ < + B Figure 1 A second protein-DNA ends complex with faster electrophoretic mobility is detected in PBL extracts .

The electrophoretic mobility of the protein-DNA complexes were analysed in 5 % polyacrylamide gel as described in Materials and methods .
F , position of free DNA probe ; A , A ' , A '' and B , positions of protein-DNA complexes consisting of DNA-ends binding activity hypotheses , we first evaluated the presence or absence of Ku70 and Ku86 proteins in the B complex , by using various antibodies directed against these proteins in EMSA supershift experiments .
First , the autoantibodies ( purified from the AF human serum ) , which were shown to recognize the Ku70 and Ku86 proteins ( Francoeur et al. , 1986 ) , were used .
In the presence of these antibodies , both A and B complexes were completely supershifted and retarded in the gel as shown in Figure 2 ( panel I ) .
Similar experiments were performed with antibodies directed either against Ku70 or Ku86 , to further assess the presence in the B complex of each subunit of the Ku herodimer .
For Ku86 , two different antibodies were used : a polyclonal antibody , Ku86 pc , and mAb S10B1 which recognizes an epitope defined by aa 8-221 on the N terminus of Ku86 ( Wang et al. , 1993 ) .
As shown in Figure 2 ( panel II and III ) , all Ku antibodies supershifted the migration of the complex B present in PBL extracts and the migration of the complex A present in PBL and AHH1 extracts shown as a control .
The mAB S10Bl affected the migration of the complex B less than the other Ku Abs ( see Figure 2 , panel III ) .
However similar results were obtained for the complex A present in PBL and in AHHI1 extracts suggesting that this lower reactivity is an inherent property of this antibody .
Thus , this set of experiments showed that both Ku70 and Ku86 were present in the complex B , the faster migration pattern indicating that one or both Ku proteins are present in an altered/modified form in PBL extracts .
The detection of the altered form of the Ku heterodimer is associated with B-lymphocyte population In PBL extracts , both forms of the Ku DNA complexes were detected by EMSA .

After 10 min , either no antibody ( control ) or antibodies specific for ( I ) Ku70 and Ku86 proteins ( mAbs AF ) , ( II ) Ku70 protein ( Ab Ku70 pc ) , ( III ) Ku86 protein , polyclonal ( Ab Ku86 pc ) , or monoclonal that recognizes aa 8-221 ( mAB S10B1 ) were added to the reaction mixture prior to gel electrophoresis .
The electrophoretic mobility of the protein-DNA complexes were analysed in 5 % polyacrylamide gel as described in Materials and methods .
F , position of free DNA probe ; positions of protein-DNA complexes consisting of DNA-ends binding activity and the region where the supershifted complexes migrate are indicated component of one of the sub-populations present in PBL .
Indeed , when whole cell extracts from purified B cells were evaluated , only the faster migrating B complex was detected ( Figure 3 ) .
Interestingly , in B cell extracts , the mobility change associated with increasing protein concentration was also observed ( detection of two additional complexes B ' and B '' when the protein concentration in the binding assay is 4 ug , Figure 3 ) suggesting that the altered form of the Ku heterodimer still has the ability to translocate on the DNA as previously described for the normal Ku protein ( deVries et a/. , 1989 ) .
In this representative experiment , the DEB activity is shown in proteins extracts obtained from the whole lymphocyte population and B cells , within the same blood sample .
Furthermore , in one sample , we verified that in T cells the usual pattern of Ku-DEB activity is detected ( data not shown ) .
Thus , these results showed that the presence of the faster migrating complex is largely confined to B cells among the circulating lymphocyte population .
The B-lymphocytes express a variant form of the Ku86 protein To further characterize the altered form of the Ku heterodimer , the expression of the Ku proteins was analysed by Western blot .
The expression of the full length Ku70 protein , which migrates at approximately 72 kDa in SDS polyacrylamide gels , was detected in PBL and B cells at a slightly lower level of expression ( about twofold ) than in the human cell lines AHH1 and HeLa ( Figure 4 , panel I ) .
In contrast , the expression of Ku86 protein was altered in the extracts obtained from lymphocytes ( Figure 4 , panel II and III ) .
In PBL extracts , in addition to the full-length 86 kDa protein , a second band , which cross-reacts with anti-Ku86 pc Ab appeared at a lower position corresponding to about 69 kDa .
This band was absent in extracts Extracts 2 ug 4 ug A PBL __ LB A PBL _ LB @ * > - Kh i Figure 3 The detection of the faster migrating complex is restricted to B cells within circulating lymphocyte population .
Increasing concentrations of protein extracts obtained from the human cell line AHHIl ( A ) , PBL or purified B cells were incubated with 0.1 ng *°P-labeled DNA probe in the presence of 1 ug of closed circular plasmid DNA , as a non specific competitor .
The electrophoretic mobility of the protein-DNA complexes were analysed in 5 % polyacrylamide gel as described in Materials and methods .

In B cells extracts , the full-length protein was not detected and only the lower 69 kDa band appeared .
These results were confirmed Negative regulation of DNA-PK activity in normal B-lymphocytes C Muller et al 1556 using the mAb S10Bl .
Again , the full-length Ku86 protein was undetectable in B cells and a lower band , present as a doublet ( at approximately 69 and 71 kDa , with a higher expression of the 69 kDa protein ) , was detected in lymphocytes that was not present in AHHI1 or HeLa cells ( Figure 4 , panel III ) .
The altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit DNA-PKes that results in a failure to detect DNA-PK activity in B cells The Ku heterodimer is the DNA-binding component of DNA-PK , the catalytic activity of which is carried by a 460 kDa protein , DNA-PKcs .
We have shown that the altered Ku heterodimer retains its capacity to bind to DNA termini .
We then investigated the capacity of the altered heterodimer to contribute , in the presence of ds-DNA , to the formation of an active DNA-PK complex .
First , the protein kinase activity of the complex was evaluated in lymphocytes and in B-purified cell population using the 'pull-down ' assay as previously described ( Finnie et al. , 1995 ) .
In this assay , only proteins able to bind to double-stranded DNA ends on cellulose beads are considered .
Furthermore , the specificity for DNA-PK activity is ensured through the use of both a consensus substrate peptide issued from the sequence of the murine p53 and a mutated peptide which is a poor substrate for DNA-PK phosphorylation in vitro .
By using this assay , a detectable amount of DNA-PK activity was found in PBL but at a significantly lower level than the one observed in the AHH1 and HeLa human cell lines ( Figure 5 ) .
In B cell extracts , no detectable DNA-PK activity was found in the three independent samples tested .
Thus , it can be deduced from these experiments that the DNA-PK activity detected in PBL was solely due to the T cells present in the PBL samples .
We then evaluated by Western blot experiments the expression of DNA-PK , in these different samples .
As shown in Figure 5 , both PBL and B cell purified population extracts contained DNA-PK .

50 ug of protein extracts obtained from human cell lines ( A , AHH1 ; H , HeLa ) , PBL or B cells were subjected to electrophoresis on a 8 % SDS polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions .
The proteins were then blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter and expression of the Ku proteins were detected as indicated in Materials and methods with indicated antibodies that recognize either the Ku70 protein ( I ) or the Ku86 protein ( II and III ) which appeared lower ( about twofold ) than in the AHH1 cell line .
Thus , these results suggested that the altered form of the Ku heterodimer present in B cells is not able to recruit the catalytic sub-unit of the complex , DNA-PKcs .
To test this hypothesis , the proteins associated with the double-stranded DNA cellulose beads were eluted and subjected to Western analyses .
Beads which have been incubated with AHH1 or PBL extracts contained DNA-PKcs as shown in Figure 6 .
In contrast , beads incubated with B cell extracts lacked DNA-PKcs .
Furthermore , proteins associated with beads from all the extracts contained the Ku proteins .

The established cell lines corresponded to AHH1 and HeLa cells .

After incubation of the indicated protein extracts with ds-DNA cellulose beads , the proteins bound to the beads were eluted as indicated in Materials and methods and subjected to electrophoresis on a 8 % SDS polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions , The proteins were then blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter and the expression of Ku70 and Ku86 was detected by Western blots using the indicated antibodies full-length Ku70 and only the variant form of Ku86 ( see Figure 6 ) .
These results imply that the altered form of the heterodimer fails to interact with DNA-PKg .
Mechanism ( s ) that contribute ( s ) to the expression of the Ku86 variant protein To test if the variant form of the Ku86 protein arises from a spliced form of Ku86 , Northern blot experiments were performed using a Ku86 cDNA probe .
As shown in Figure 7 , in the control cell line AHH1 , Ku86 probe hybridized to two mRNAs of 2.6 and 3.4 kb as previously described ( Cai et al. , 1994 ; Jongmans et al. , 1996 ) .
The two Ku86 transcripts were also present in PBL and in purified B-lymphocytes and no smaller form of Ku86 mRNA was detected in B-lymphocytes .
Discussion In this study , we demonstrate that the Ku DNA-end binding activity is altered in peripheral blood B-lymphocytes with the expression of a faster mobility complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) , as compared with human cell lines .
Western blot analysis revealed that B cells express a variant form of the Ku86 protein with an apparent molecular weight of 69 kDa , and not the 86 kDa- full-length protein .
Although the heterodimer Ku70/variant-Ku86 binds to DNA-ends , this altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic component of the complex , which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA-PK activity in B cells .
Characteristics of the variant Ku86 protein The results obtained in our study strongly suggest that the protein detected in B-lymphocytes indeed corresponds to a variant form of Ku8 # 6 rather than an unrelated protein which cross-reacts with Ku86 antibodies .
It has been reported that the active DNA end binding member of the heterodimer is likely to be Ku70 ( Zhang and Yaneva , 1992 ) .
One study raised the possibility that Ku70 might carry out this DEB function in the absence of Ku86 ( Wang et al. , 1994 ) but this remains controversial ( Griffith et al. , 1992 ) .
Indeed , recent work using in vitro-translated Ku products clearly showed that full-length individual subunits are inactive for DEB activity indicating that heterodimer assembly precedes , and is necessary for PBL LB LB Figure 7 Northern blot experiments .
5 ug of total RNA obtained from the control cell line AHHI1 ( H ) , peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) or B-lymphocytes ( LB , two independent healthy donors ) were separated on a 1.2 % agarose - 7 % formaldehyde gel , transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with a Ku86 cDNA probe .
The size of the two Ku86 mRNAs transcripts detected is indicated 3.4 kb - » 2.6 kb - » Negative regulation of DNA-PK activity in normal B-lymphocytes C Muller et al DNA-binding ( Wu et al. , 1996 ) .
Thus , since Ku86 full-length protein is undetectable in B-lymphocytes , it appears that the second band detected by the Western blot experiments is indeed a variant form of the Ku86 protein which results in DEB activity by the assembly with Ku70 protein .
Similar expression of a variant form of the Ku86 protein ( but in addition to the full-length protein ) has been recently reported in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line , HL60 ( Han et a/. , 1996 ) .
The variant form of the Ku86 protein detected in B-lymphocytes presents similarities with the protein detected in HL60 cell line .
In both studies , the mAb S10B1 ( aa 8-221 ) detected a doublet consisting of two lower forms of the Ku86 protein with apparent molecular weight of 69 and 71 kDa .
In the HL60 cell line , another mAb which recognizes the 610-705 aa of Ku86 ( mAb 111 ) failed to recognize the variant form of the protein .
Interestingly , in a previous report , only the full-length Ku86 was detected in PBL using this antibody ( Ajmani et al. , 1995 ) , suggesting that mAb 111 also fails to recognize the Ku86 variant expressed in lymphocytes .
Finally , we observed that mAb 150 which recognizes an epitope within amino acid 490 to 707 of the Ku86 protein ( Kamiya Biomedical Co , Seattle , Washington , USA ) did not affect the migration of the altered Ku heterodimer-DNA complexes in EMSA supershift experiments ( data not shown ) .
At the present time , the domain ( s ) responsible for the interaction between Ku86 or the Ku heterodimer with the catalytic component of the DNA-PKcs complex remain ( s ) unknown .
The inability of the mAb 111 ( aa 610-705 ) to recognize the variant form of Ku8 # 6 in the HL60 cell line ( Han et al. , 1996 ) and in PBL ( Ajmani et al. , 1995 ) and of the mAb 150 ( aa 490-707 ) to supershift KuT7O0/variant Ku8 # 6 DNA complexes ( our results ) may implicate the C-terminal part of the protein in this function .
However , only reconstitution studies with various deletion mutants of the Ku86 protein will allow this question to be answered since conformational changes induced in the Ku86 variant ( and not the region deleted ) can be discounted for the decreased ability to recruit DNA-PK , ; .
Presently , the mechanism which contributes to the expression by B cells of this variant form of Ku86 remains unknown .
This expression appeared however to result from a significant biological event occurring within the cells .
The possibility that a nonspecific proteolytic cleavage of Ku86 may have occurred during preparation of cell extracts can be ruled out since , ( i ) the expression of the variant form of Ku86 was observed in extracts from circulating blood lymphocytes and not from continuous human cell lines , even when the extract preparations were performed simultaneously ; ( ii ) a large set of protease inhibitors was used during protein extraction ( see Material and methods ) that consistently would abrogate the cleavage events induced by the major classes of known proteases ; ( iii ) it has been previously demonstrated that unstimulated B cells have low protease activity as compared to mitogen-activated cells ( Kishi et al. , 1983 ; Ku et al. , 1983 ) .
Finally , our results suggest that the mechanism that contributes to the expression of the variant Ku86 protein occurs at the post-transcriptional level .
Indeed , the fact that B-lymphocytes express the two Ku86 transcripts also detected in cell lines ( Cai et al. , 1994 ; 1557 Negative regulation of DNA-PK activity in normal B-lymphocytes C Muller et al 1558 Jongmans et al. , 1996 and our present results ) , and not a smaller form , strongly suggests that the variant Ku86 protein does not arise from a spliced form of Ku86 and favor the involvement of event such as specific proteolysis .
Implication of the absence of DNA-PK activity for DNA DSB repair activity in B cell lymphocytes The catalytic component of the DNA-PK complex is essential for DNA DSB repair activity .
Indeed , mutant cell lines such as the hamster V-3 and the murine seid cell line that exhibited normal levels of Ku-DNA ends binding activity but are defective in the catalytic sub-unit , DNA-PKcs ( Blunt et al. , 1995 ; Peterson et al. , 1995 ) show a defect in DSB repair after exposition to ionizing radiation .
Interestingly , among normal fresh human cells , resting peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) are especially sensitive to IR and within sub-populations of lymphocytes , B cells are more sensitive than T cells ( Prosser , 1976 ; Prusek and Astaldi , 1979 ; Schwartz and Gaulden , 1980 ) .
This relative radiosensitivity appears to be related to a defect in DNA-repair capacity of these cells , especially in the rejoining of DSB ( Mayer et al. , 1986 ) .
In accordance with the major functional role of DNA-PK in DSBs repair , the observed defect in DNA-PK activity in our study provides a molecular basis for the increased sensitivity of B cells to ionizing radiation .
Furthermore , since T cells , on the contrary , appear to contain detectable levels of DNA-PK activity ( see Figure 5 and comments ) , our data may explain the known difference in sensitivity towards IR between these two lymphocyte sub-populations .
Besides lymphocytes , differences in radiosensitivity are observed in cells derived from different tumor types , as well as in normal tissues within and between individuals .
The molecular mechanism responsible for these differences are not well understood ( McMillan and Peacock , 1994 ) .
The level of DNA-PK activity is likely to play a role in this variation in radiosensitivity , as we have shown here for normal lymphocytes .
The expression of the Ku86 variant protein may be important for the regulation of DNA-PK activity in vivo and studies of its expression and distribution amongst primary normal human cell and tissues may help to further understand the physiological mechanism ( s ) underlying the relative radiosensitivity in humans .
Role of the Ku86 variant in B cell differentiation Finally , our results suggest that DNA-PK activity is regulated during B cell differentiation in a stage specific manner , through the expression of a truncated form of the Ku86 protein .
Indeed , V ( D ) J recombination occurs at defined stages of lymphocyte development and this function is primarily regulated by the expression of the two recombination activating genes , RAG1 and RAG2 ( for review see Weaver et al. , 1995 ) .
Whether or not the expression and activity of DNA-PK holoenzyme is also actively regulated in human cells upon differentiation and V ( D ) J rearrangement still remains unknown .
However , the fact that DNA-PK is an essential component of the V ( D ) J recombination process suggests that this activity is present in actively recombining pro/pre-B cells in contrast to its absence observed in our study in unstimulated circulating B-lymphocytes .
In the light of differences in DNA-PK activity between circulating B and T cells observed in our study , it is interesting to note that recently published works underline unsuspected differences in the molecular regulation of early B and T cell differentiation , leading to the idea that partial bypass of DNA-PK-dependent pathway of DSBs rejoining may occur in the T cell , but not the B cell , lineage .
Indeed , a single treatment of newborn seid mice with DNA-damaging agents restored functional , diverse T cell receptor B chain coding joints , as well as development and differentiation of thymocytes , but did not promote B cell development ( Danska et a/. , 1994 ) .
In addition , p53 deficiency promoted T cell development but did not appear to circumvent the block in B cell maturation conferred by the scid mutation ( Guidos et al. , 1996 ; Nacht et al. , 1996 ) .
All these data provide evidence that the later steps involved in V ( D ) J joining are not regulated identi-cally , in T and B cells .
Thus , whether the relative expression of the variant form of Ku86 protein is used by human B cells to actively regulate DNA-PK activity upon differentiation and V ( D ) J rearrangement appears an important issue .
In conclusion , we have shown that DNA-PK activity is negatively regulated in normal circulating B cells through an original mechanism that involves the expression of a variant form of the Ku86 protein .
Whether the expression of this variant protein is restricted to B cells amongst primary human cells and tissues , and the molecular mechanism that contributes to its expression , appears to give rise to two important issues that are currently investigated in our laboratory .

Polyclonal antibodies directed against Ku86 and Ku70 ( designated Ku86 pc and Ku70 pc in our study ) were provided by Dr Falaschi ( UNIDO , Trieste , Italy ) ( Tuteja et al. , 1994 ) ; Human serum ( AF ) that contained autoantibodies that cross-reacted with Ku70 and Ku86 antigens ( Francoeur et al. , 1986 ) were provided by Dr EM Tan ( the Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , USA ) and purified antibodies were obtained in our laboratory by the protein A sepharose procedure .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes and transformed cell lines Blood samples ( 50 to 100 mL ) were collected in hepar-inized tubes from healthy consenting volunteers .
Mononuclear cell suspensions were obtained after Hypaque-Ficoll ( MSL , Eurobio , France ) gradient centrifugation as previously described ( Barret et al. , 1995 ) .
Mononuclear cells at the interface were collected , diluted to 1 x 10° cells/ ml in RPMI 1640 medium , and incubated in tissue culture flasks for 2 h at 37°C to remove monocytes by adherence .
After monocyte depletion , the samples were divided into two parts .
The first part of the sample was used for immediate cell extract preparation of the whole lymphocyte population ( PBL ) .
The second part of the sample was processed to obtain purified B cell suspension as follows : samples were incubated with antibody to CD3 ( mAb UCHTI1 , Dako , Trappes , France ) and T cells then removed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgGl ( Fc ) antibody coupled to magnetic beads according to the manufacturer 's recommendation ( Dynabeads M-450 , Dy-nal , Oslo , Norway ) .
Under these conditions , less than 0.5 % CD3 or CD14 positive cells were detected in the highly purified CD 19+ B cell population ( data not shown ) .
Cell viability was > 90 % by trypan blue exclusion .
Following purification , B-lymphocytes were immediately used for cell extract preparation or RNA extraction .
The Epstein-Barr virus immortalized human lymphoblastoid AHH1 and the human HeLa cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco BRL , Cergy Pontoise , France ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 mM glutamine , 125 U/ml penicillin , and 125 ug/ml streptomycin .
Cell extracts Whole cell extracts were prepared as previously described with slight modifications ( Finnie et al. , 1995 ) .
Briefly , cells were resuspended in extraction buffer ( 2x 10 '' cells per 100 ul for transformed cell lines and 5 x 10 '' cells per 100 ul for normal human lymphocytes ) containing 50 mM NaF , 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.8 ) , 450 mm NaCl , 25 % glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of proteinase inhibitors [ 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluor-ide , 0.5 ug/ml apoprotin , 0.5 ug/ml chymostatin , 0.5 ug/ml leupeptin and 1.5 ug/ml pepstatin ] , then frozen on dry ice and thawed at 30°C three times .
After centrifugation for 30 min at 4°C , supernatants were stored at -70°C .
Band shift assay The probe was prepared as follows : an aliquot of a 123-bp DNA ladder ( Gibco BRL , France ) was digested with Aval ( Gibco BRL , Cergy Pontoise , France ) in order to generate 123 bp monomers .
After purification from agarose gel , fragments were end-labeled with « - '' P-dCTP using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment ( Gibco BRL , France ) .
End-labeled probes were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by chromatography through Sephadex G-50 ( Sigma , Saint Quentin , France ) .
The band shift assay was performed as previously described ( Zhang and Yaneva , 1992 ) .
In the supershift experiments , antibodies ( at the indicated concentration ) were added to the reaction mixture following 10 min incubation at 30°C and incubated for an additional 20 min prior to gel electrophoresis .
Western blot Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions .
The proteins were then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter using a semi-dry apparatus ( Bio-Rad Trans-Blot , Bio-Rad , Ivry- References Ajmani AK , Satoh M , Reap E , Cohen PL and Reeves WH .

Negative regulation of DNA-PK activity in normal B-lymphocytes C Muller et al sur-Seine , France ) .
Western blot experiments were performed as previously described ( Muller et al. , 1994 ) .
Antibodies used in Western-blotting experiments were as follows : the polyclonal antibodies directed against Ku70 and Ku80 proteins were used at a 1:2500 dilution ( secondary antibody mouse anti-rabbit at a 1:2500 dilution ) .
The purified monoclonal antibody directed against Ku86 ( mAb S10B1 ) was used at a 1 : 1000 dilution and the anti DNA-PKcs antibody 18-2 at a 1:5000 dilution ( secondary antibody goat anti-mouse at a 1:2500 and 1 : 5000 dilution , respectively ) .
DNA-PK assay DNA-PK 'pulldown ' kinase assay was performed as previously described ( Finnie et a/. , 1995 ) .
In certain experiments , after incubation of the extracts with double-stranded DNA-cellulose beads ( Sigma , Saint-Quentin , France ) , beads were extensively washed with Z ' 0.05 buffer [ 25 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mm KCl , 10 mw MgC12 , 20 % glycerol , 0.1 % Nodinet P-40 , 1 mM dithio-threitol ] and incubated for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCI pH 9.0/ Triton 1 % with constant agitation to elute proteins bound to the beads .
Samples were then electrophoresed in an 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions .
Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters which were subjected to Western blot analysis for the presence of DNA-PKcs , and Ku proteins as indicated above .
Northern blotting Total RNA was isolated from lymphocytes and control cell line ( AHH1 ) using TRIZOL reagent ( GIBCO BRL ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendation .
Five to 10 ug of RNA were then separated on a 1.2 % agarose 7 % formaldehyde gel .
RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized as previously described ( Muller et a/. , 1994 ) using a Ku86 cDNA probe ( from nucleotide 248 to nucleotide 1198 ) .
Before hybridization experiments the transfer membranes were photographed under U.V .
