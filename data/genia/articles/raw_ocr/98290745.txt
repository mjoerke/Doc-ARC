Signaling by hToll is shown to occur through sequential recruitment of the adapter molecule MyD88 and the IL- 1R-associated kinase .
Tumor necrosis factor receptor-activated factor 6 ( TRAF6 ) and the nuclear factor kB kinase ( NIK ) are both involved in subsequent steps of NF-KB activation .
Conversely , a dominant negative version of TR AF6 failed to block induced activation of stress-activated protein kinase/ c-Jun NH , - terminal kinases , thus suggesting an early divergence of the two pathways .
Key words : stress-activated protein kinase mmune response to infection requires the production of cy- tokines and costimulatory molecules by antigen-presenting cells .
Distinct cell-associated receptors on myelomonocytic cells , such as CD14 , allow the recognition of pathogen-associated molecules and trigger natural immune response by inducing the production of inflammatory cytokines that subsequently signal to activate adaptive immunity ( 1 ) .
The molecular mechanisms that control the initial induction of these signals upon infection have been explored recently .
In particular , a novel transmembrane receptor ho-mologous to the Drosophila Toll , human Toll ( hToll , also called TLR 4 ) , has been cloned recently ( 2 , 3 ) .
The Drosgph-ila Toll protein controls the potent antifungal response in Drosophila adults ( 4 ) .
Analogously , hT oll has been shown to signal activation of adaptive immunity in humans by inducing the expression of B7.1 , IL-6 , and IL-8 ; thus , it represents a key molecule for the switching from natural to acquired immunity .
However , the biochemical transduction pathway triggered by hT oll was ill-defined ( 2 ) .
hToll is a type I orphan receptor with an extracellular portion containing leucine-rich repeats , and a cytoplasmic domain significantly similar to the intracellular portion of the IL- 1R type I ( IL- 1R1T ) and the IL-1R accessory protein ( IL- 1R AcP ) ( 2 , 5 , 6 ) ; these observations suggest that they may use an analogous molecular framework for signaling .
IL-1 triggers the activation of distinct transcription fac-tors , including NF-KB and c-Jun/ activator protein 1 , that 2097 Toll * interleukin 1 receptor * nuclear factor kB * c-Jun NH , -terminal kinase/ subsequently drive the transcriptional induction of several cytokine genes ( 7 ) .
The molecular events occurring from the IL-1R signaling complex to the induction of NF-kB activity have been characterized recently ; in particular , the adapter protein MyD88 recruits two distinct putative Ser/ Thr kinases , namely IL- 1R -associated kinase ( IR AK ) and IRAK-2 , to the receptor complex ( 8-10 ) .
IRAK and IR AK-2 interact subsequently with the adapter molecule TNFR -activated factor ( TRAF ) 6 , which bridges them to the protein kinase kinase ( NIK ) ( 8 , 11 , 12 ) .
Finally , NIK activates the I-kB kinase complex ( in-cluding IKKa and IKKB ) that directly phosphorylates ( 13-17 ) .
In this study , we identified and molecularly ordered the mediators of the hToll-induced NF-KB and stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) / c-Jun NH , -terminal kinase ( JNK ) activation cascade .

An aliquot of the cell lysate was also analyzed for NF-KB activation as above .
Results and Discussion The expression and eventual regulation of specific transcripts encoding for hToll were analyzed in distinct cell types that play a critical role in the natural immune response .
In particular , human monocytes were separated from healthy donors and treated with the bacterial product LPS for different periods of time .
As shown in Fig .
1 A , specific transcripts for hToll were present in these cells and were induced significantly after treatment with LPS .
These observations suggest that modulation of a nonclonal receptor , namely hToll , after exposure to infectious agents may play a regulatory role in the natural immune response .
Of note , PMN and dendritic cells also transcribed hToll mRNA at different levels ( our unpublished observations ) .
We next analyzed the hToll signaling pathway at the molecular level .
A chimeric version of hToll in which the extra cellular portion was substituted with the corresponding region of CD4 ( CD4/ hToll ) has been shown previously to induce NF-kB activation in Jurkat cells ( 2 ) .
We engineered distinct expression constructs encoding for Flag epitope-tagged hToll ( hToll-Flag ) or for a truncated version of hToll that lacks most of the cytoplasmic portion ( AhToll-Flag ) .
Ectopic expression of hToll-Flag but not AhToll-Flag induced NF-KB activation in human embryonic 293T cells at levels similar to the CD4/ Toll chimeric protein that served as a positive control ( Fig .
1 , B and C ) .
From these observations , it is apparent that either CD4-driven or ectopic ex-pression-forced aggregation of the cytoplasmic portions of distinct hToll receptors is sufficient to trigger a signaling cas- 2099 Muzio et al .

cade that leads ultimately to activation of the transcription factor NF-kB .
Given this , one could speculate that an as yet unidentified hToll ligand binds to hToll and induces its oli-gomerization and subsequent signaling cascade , in a manner similar to IL-1 and TNF with their cognate receptors .

Overview of hToll and TNFR-1 signaling pathways .
The diagram shows that the bifurcation of NF-kB and JNK/ SAPK activation by hToll or TNFR -1 occurs at different levels with respect to the specific TRAFs .

RIP , Receptor-interacting protein .
Brief Definitive R eport are conserved in all of these proteins , have been shown to be essential for IL- 1RI to signal ( Fig .
2 A ) ( 20 ) .
Since we have shown recently a homophilic interaction to occur between the IL-1RAcP and MyD88 throughout their ho-mologous domains ( 8 ) , we asked whether hToll and the adapter protein MyD88 could interact .
Upon coexpression , MyD88 and hToll formed an immunoprecipitable complex ; in contrast , a mutant version of hToll , which lacks the region of homology to MyD88 and which was unable to induce NF-KB activation , failed to bind MyD88 ( Fig .
2 B ) .
A mutant version of MyD88 ( AMyD88 ) , encoding only for the COOH-terminal IL- 1 R -like domain , abrogates IL-1R I/ IL- 1R AcP-induced NF-KB activation ( 8 ) ; given this , we analyzed whether AMyD88 could act as a dominant negative inhibitor of hToll-induced NF-KB activation .
As predicted , AMyD88 specifically inhibited hToll-induced but not TNFR -2-induced NF-KB activity , lending functional credence to the interaction occurring between hToll and MyD88 ( Fig .
2 C ) .
From these observations , it is apparent that both IL-1R and hToll recruit the adapter protein MyD88 to their respective signaling complex .
IR AK and IR AK-2 are two additional proximal mediators of the IL- 1R signaling complex ; IR AK is recruited to the IL-1R AcP , whereas IR AK-2 preferentially binds IL-1RI ( 8 , 10 ) .
Given this , we asked whether IRAK or IR AK-2 could interact with hToll .
Upon ectopic expres-sion , IRAK and hToll formed an immunoprecipitable complex .
In contrast , IR AK-2 bound only weakly to hToll compared with IL-1RI ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) , thus suggesting that it may not represent a relevant hToll signal transducer .
NF-KB activation induced by a number of cytokine receptors is mediated by members of the TR AF adapter fam-ily .
TR AF2 , for example , plays a critical role in NF-KB activation mediated by TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 ( 21 , 22 ) .
TR AF6 has been implicated in the IL-1 signaling pathway and has been shown to complex with IR AK and IR AK-2 downstream to the receptor signaling complex ( 8 , 11 ) .
Therefore , we determined whether dominant negative versions of either could act to inhibit hToll-induced NF-KB activity .
ATR AFG but not ATR AF2 significantly impaired hToll-induced activity , suggesting that TRAFG6 may act as an additional downstream mediator of the induced NF-KB activation cascade ( Fig .
3 C ) .
The protein kinase NIK has been shown to act as a general mediator of TRAF-induced NF-KB activation ( 12 ) ; once activated , NIK directly phosphorylates and activates the IKKa/ B complex , which is responsible for I-kBa phos phorylation and subsequent NF-KB activation ( 13-17 ) .
Dominant negative versions of NIK , in which the critical lysine has been mutated to alanine [ NIK 429-430 ( KK-AA ) ] , act to inhibit NF-kB activation induced by Fas , TNF , and IL-1 ( 12 ) .
Given this , we asked whether NIK ( KK-AA ) could inhibit hToll-induced NF-KB activation .
NIK ( KK-AA ) abrogated NF-KB activity triggered by hToll ectopic expression ( Fig .
3 C ) as well as by TR AFG overexpression ( not shown ) .
In addition to inducing activation of NF-kB , distinct inflammatory cytokines also induce SAPK , also known as JNK .
The active phosphorylated form of SAPK binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factors c-Jun , activating transcription factor 2 ( ATF2 ) , and ternary complex factor ( TCF ) / Elk1 ( 23-25 ) .
In particular , activation of SAPK/ JNK by the TNFR -1 occurs through a TR AF2-dependent pathway , as a dominant negative version of TR AF2 acts to inhibit both NF-KB and c-Jun activation induced by TNF ( 18 , 26 , 27 ) .
In contrast , a dominant negative version of NIK , which abrogates TNF-induced NF-kB activation , fails to inhibit c-Jun phosphorylation , supporting a model wherein TNF-mediated NF-KB and c-Jun pathways bifurcate at TRAF2 ( 28 , 29 ) .
Therefore , we analyzed whether hToll induced SAPK/JNK .
Ectopic expression of increasing amounts of hToll-Flag but not AhToll-Flag resulted in activation of SAPK~y as indicated by specific phosphorylation at Thr 183 and Tyr 185 ( Fig .
4 A ) .
Overexpression of TR AF6 also activated SAPK as described previously ( 28 ) .
To identify mediators of hToll-mediated JNK activation , we cotransfected 293 cells with hToll and dominant negative versions of either MyD88 or TRAF6 .
Surprisingly , AMyD88 but not ATR A6 acted to inhibit hToll-triggered JNK phosphorylation ( Fig .
4 B ) .
Importantly , under the same experimental conditions , both AMyD88 and ATR AFG abrogated hToll-induced NF-KB activation ( 96 and 90 % in-hibition , respectively ) .
Additionally , ATR AFG alone , as well as AMyD88 , failed to activate JNK ( data not shown ) .
Col-lectively , these observations indicate that although ectopic expression of TR AF6 induced SAPK , a dominant negative version of TRAF6 failed to inhibit hToll-induced JNK phosphorylation .
Given this , one could speculate that although TR AF6 overexpression is sufficient to activate JNK/ SAPK , endogenous TR AFG does not provide a significant contribution to JNK/ SAPK activation by hToll ( Fig .
5 ) .
Regardless , MyD88 appears to represent the most upstream mediator of the hToll-mediated signaling cascade , which ultimately activates NF-KB and c-Jun , thus driving transcriptional activation of several cytokines and costimulatory molecules .
Therefore , it may represent a potentially useful therapeutic target for controlling the molecular switch from the innate to the adaptive immune response .
