Triggering of the Human Interleukin-6 Gene by Interferon-y and Tumor Necrosis Factor- « in Monocytic Cells Involves Cooperation between Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 , NFB , and Spl Transcription Factors* ( Received for publication , May 22 , 1995 , and in revised form , September 1 , 1995 ) Josiane Sancéau $ § , Tsuneyasu Kaisho { , Toshio Hiranof , and Juana Wietzerbint From { INSERM , U365 , `` Interferons et Cytokines , '' Institut Curie , Section de Recherches , 26 , rue d'Ulm , 75231 Paris , France and the { Biomedical Research Center , Osaka University Medical School , Division of Molecular Oncology , 2-2 Yamada-oka , Suita , Osaka 565 , Japan We investigated the molecular basis of the synergistic induction by interferon-y ( IFN-y ) /tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF-a ) of human interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) gene in THP-1 monocytic cells , and compared it with the basis of this induction by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
Functional studies with IL-6 promoter demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the IFN-y and/or TNF-a @ action , whereas only one of these regions seemed to be implicated in LPS activation .
The three regions concerned are : 1 ) a region between -73 and -36 , which is the minimal element inducible by LPS or TNF-a ; 2 ) an element located between -181 and -73 , which appeared to regulate the response to IFN-y and TNF-a negatively ; and 3 ) a distal element upstream of -224 , which was inducible by IFN-y alone .
LPS signaling was found to involve NFxB activation by the p50/p65 heterodimers .
Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-y and TNF-a , in monocytic cells , involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NFB p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter .
This removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Spl factor , whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-y .
IL-6 '' is a multifunctional cytokine involved in controlling many cell functions , including antibody synthesis by B cells , T cell cytotoxicity , stem cell differentiation , and induction of acute phase proteins .
IL-6 is produced in response to a variety of noxious stimuli , including viral and bacterial infections ( I-4 ) .
Deficient regulation of the IL-6 gene is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and affects normal and leukemic hematopoiesis ( 4-9 ) .

The transcriptional regulatory elements present in the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-6 gene have been studied by several laboratories .
Various elements responsible for IL-6 gene induction have been identified , including phorbol 12-my-ristate 13-acetate , cAMP , NFkB , NF-IL-6 , and multiple cyto-kine-responsive elements ( 3 , 4 , 12-16 ) .
Tumor suppressor gene products p53 and pRB have been reported to suppress IL-6 promoter activity ( 17 ) .
Different laboratories , including ours , showed that there are cell type- dependent differences in the mechanism and transcription factors involved in IL-6 gene induction .
Thus , TNF- « induced IL-6 in a variety of cell types ( 18-21 ) , but it failed to do so in monocytes ( 2 , 3 , 20 ) .
We have shown that IFN-y is an essential co-signal for TNF-a in the induction of IL-6 in monocytic THP-1 cells ( 22 ) .
The role of IL-6 in the immune response , acute phase reac-tion , and hematopoiesis , and the fact that monocytic cells appeared to be one of the major physiological sources of this cytokine , prompted us to analyze the molecular mechanism responsible for its induction in this cell type .
Although the mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by different inducers in several cell types has been extensively studied , the mechanism responsible for synergistic IL-6 gene induction by IFN-y and TNF-a in monocytic cells has still not been identified .
We postulated that both IFN-y and TNF-a @ activate transcription factors , which should act simultaneously to induce IL-6 gene expression .
This hypothesis was supported by our previous finding that sequential stimulation with IFN-y , followed by TNF-a stimulation , did not lead to IL-6 mRNA induction ( 22 ) .
This implied that IFN-y and TNF-a induced or activated different transiently expressed components , which must act together in cooperation to trigger IL-6 gene expression .
It has been suggested that the induction of NFB binding activity by TNF- « contributes to the activation of the IL-6 promoter in some cell lines , including monocytic cells ( 3 , 18-20 ) .
The NFxB/Rel family of transcription factors consists of at least five proteins , including p65 ( Rel A ) , p50 , c-Rel , and p52 , which are related to each other through an N-terminal stretch of 300 amino acids called the Rel homology domain .
DNA binding occurs through dimerization of the family members , resulting in numerous homo- and heterodimeric combinations of NFxB/Rel proteins .
The C-terminal region of p65 , c-Rel , and Rel-B harbor a transcriptional activation domain , and the in vivo transcriptional activity is attributed to the p65- , c-Rel- , 27920 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Role of IRF-1 , NFkB , and Sp1 in Human IL-6 Gene Regulation and Rel-B-containing dimers ( 23 ) .
The elements involved in the IFN-y-mediated induction of IL-6 expression are not known .
The binding of IFN « /8 to their specific receptors rapidly activates a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor , ISGF3 ( interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 ) .
ISGF3 is transiently activated and has been shown to stimulate ISRE-dependent transcription ( 24-27 ) .
Other regulatory factors , including interferon-regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) and IRF-2 , have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of the IFN system .
IRF-1 and IRF-2 bind to similar cis elements within type I IFN and IFN-inducible genes .
IRF-1 functions as a transcriptional activator , while IRF-2 represses IRF-1 function ( 28-33 ) .
Both factors appear also to bind specifically to ISRE sequences ( 34 , 35 ) .
We performed a functional analysis of the 5'-flanking region of IL-6 gene using transient transfection of CAT reporter gene linked to IL-6 promoter , in order to clarify the molecular mechanism involved in the synergistic induction by IFN-y and TNF-a of the IL-6 gene in human monocytes .
The monocytic THP-1 cell model appears to be particularly suitable for molecular dissection of IFN-y/TNF-a-mediated synergistic induction of IL-6 gene expression , because in these cells , the IL-6 gene is not constitutively expressed ( 22 ) .
Analysis of IL-6 promoter constructs , electrophoresis mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , and immunoprecipitation analysis have shown that the synergistic induction of IL-6 gene by IFN-y and TNF-a in human monocytic cells involved cooperation between IRF-1 and NFxB binding elements , as well as the removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element ( RCE ) present in the IL-6 promoter ( IL-6-RCE ) .
This IL-6-RCE con-tained , among other components , a core 5'-CCGCC-3 ' sequence homologous with the consensus binding motif , which is the target of the Sp1 factor .
Sp1 is a constitutively expressed transcription factor present in a wide range of cell types and binds a GC-rich consensus sequence present in many cellular and viral promoters .
Spl contains three zinc fingers that mediate DNA binding and four domains that mediate transcriptional activation ( 36 ) .
Upon binding to the DNA containing the GC box in the cell nucleus , Sp1 becomes phosphorylated on multiple sites by double-stranded DNA-dependent kinase ( 37 ) .
It has been shown that specific interaction between DNA-binding domains of the p65 subunit-NFxB and Sp1 bound the DNA modulates transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in response to cellular activation ( 38 ) .
Our results show that the contribution of IFN-y to the triggering of IL-6 gene expression in human monocytes involves a change in the amount and phosphorylated state of Sp1 , together with the induction and activation of IRF-1 .
These factors cooperate synergistically with homodimer p65-NF xB , which is activated by TNF-a .

DNA Extraction-Plasmid DNA were prepared with the Qiagen plasmid kit ( Qiagen , Coger , France ) , followed by two cycles of purification of closed circular DNA by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl-ethidium bromide gradients ( 40 ) .
RESULTS Functional Analysis of 5 Cis-regulatory Elements of the Human IL-6 Gene-Functional analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-6 gene was carried out using the - 1200 to +14 fragment as well as a series of 5'-deletion mutants of IL-6 promoter , linked to a reporter pCAT-basic plasmid , which lacks both enhancer and promoter sequences ( Fig .
1A ) .
These plasmids were used to transfect THP-1 cells by electroporation , and 1 h later , the cells were stimulated by either IFN-y and/or TNF-a , or by LPS , and tested for CAT activity after 36 h. When Role of IRF-1 , NFkB , and Sp1 in Human IL-6 Gene Regulation THP-1 cells were transfected with the construct containing 1200 base pairs of the IL-6 -flanking region , they exhibited a 5-fold increase in CAT activity in response to combined treatment with IFN-y + TNF-a , and a 2.5-fold increase after IFN-y treatment , but displayed no significant response to TNF- @ alone .
As expected , LPS induced a 7-fold increase in CAT activity ( Fig .
1B ) , in agreement with the observations reported by other groups for other cell systems ( 8 , 4 , 17-20 ) .
Deletions of the regions between -1200 and -224 and between -1200 and -181 resulted in constructs whose respective CAT activities rose 4-fold and 2.5-fold in response to IFN-y + TNF-a « treatment , and 5-fold and 4-fold in response to LPS .
Removal of the region spanning nucleotides -1200 to -224 abolished the sensitivity to IFN-y .
Deletion of the IL-6 promoter fragment up to nucleotide -108 resulted in a loss of the synergistic increase in CAT activity in response to IFN-y + TNF- « stimulation , whereas 2-fold CAT activity was still observed after LPS .
Although successive deletions at the 5 end of the IL-6 promoter fragment resulted in a progressive reduction of the inducibility of CAT activity by LPS , the construct containing the region from -73 to +14 retained its sensitivity to LPS and continued to display a 3-fold increase in CAT activity .
It was interesting to observe that this fragment became inducible by TNF-a and exhibited a 2-fold increase in CAT activity .
However , no synergistic effect was induced by IFN-y + TNF-a .
Removal of the region from -1200 to -36 resulted in the complete loss of inducibility by IFN-y and/or TNF-a @ , and by LPS ( Fig .
1B ) .
The results of the deletion analysis described above suggested the presence of at least three regions differentially involved in IL-6 gene regulation by IFN-y and/or TNF-a « , and by LPS .
The first region is a distal fragment between -1200 and -224 that positively regulates the response to IFN-y alone .
Although deletion of this fragment does not eliminate the synergistic IFN-y + TNF-a response , a slide reduction in the magnitude of the induction of CAT activity is observed .
Com-puter-based observation showed that this fragment contains an AP-1 site between -283 and -277 , and a copy of the IFN enhancer core sequence 5'-AAAGGA-3 ' ( -253/-248 ) ( 13 ) .
The second region is a repressor element , i.e .
the sequence between -181 and -73 , which would negatively affect the synergistic response to IFN-y and TNF-a « without affecting sensitivity to LPS .
This IL-6 DNA sequence contains , from -126 to -101 , a direct repeat which is strikingly similar to the c-fos basal transcription element , with 21/26 nucleotides matching the RB-repressible RCE ( the RB control element ) identified in the c-fos gene ( 17 , 46 ) .
In this connection , Santhanam et al .
( 17 ) showed in functional assays that the overexpression of wild type RB in Hela cells strongly repressed the activity of IL-6 promoter constructs .
In addition to these two elements , a third region located between -73 and -36 , probably corresponding to the minimal element necessary for the LPS response , also allowed TNF-a sensitivity .
Within this fragment were a putative AP-1 motif ( -61 to -55 ) and the sequence TCC-3 ' ( -72 to -63 ) , which is highly homologous to the immunoglobulin x light-chain enhancer sequence 5'-GGGG-ACTTTCC-3 ' ( 42 ) .
Activation of Nuclear Protein ( s ) Binding to the IL-6 Promoter DNA Fragments after Stimulation of THP-1 Cells-To determine whether IFN-y and/or TNF- « @ induced the binding of factors that specifically recognize DNA sequences in the IL-6 promoter , we prepared double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to IL-6 promoter DNA motif targets of specific transacting factors reported to be involved in the IL-6 gene induction in other cell types ( 3 , 12-16 ) .

Functional analysis of the 5'- del -36 del -224/€E cis-regulatory elements of the IL-6 gene : relative CAT activity .
A , schematic extended map of the IL-6 promoter , with the locations of DNA motifs known to be implicated in IL-6 gene induction by various inducers , and deletion mutants of del -224/Emt 31 the human IL-6 promoter fused to the B promoterless CAT gene .
B , to assess basal promoter activity and its responsiveness to IFN-y and/or and to LPS , THP-1 cells were tranfected as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
CAT activity was determined after 36 h. The IL-6 promoter response ( -fold induction ) is the ratio of CAT activity in stimulated cells to that in unstimulated cells , which is defined as 1.0 .
Values are means of eight independent experiments with standard deviation less than 10 % .
Relative induction of CAT activity and cells stimulated for 1 h with either IFN-y and/or TNF-a or with LPS , were submitted to EMSA with several radiolabeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides .
This experiment was an initial experiment , which was designed to screen the early induction of specific protein-DNA complexes .
Fig .
2 shows an EMSA using five different oligonucleotides corresponding to ( i ) NFxB-like and AP-1 binding motifs ( A/ -73 ) , ( 11 ) IL-6-RCE ( RB control element ) target motif ( B/-126 ) , ( iii ) the typical cAMP/phorbol ester-responsive motif , and the IL-1/TNF- « responsive elements ( C/-173 ) , ( iv ) the negative regulatory domain-like sequence ( and two putative copies of GGAAA motifs considered to be responsible for IFN inducibility ( D/-207 ) , and ( v ) the consensus AP-1 motif and a copy of the IFN enhancer core sequence 5'-AAAGGA-3 ' ( E/-283 ) ( 13 ) .
Formation of protein-DNA complexes was apparent with the three regions A , B , and E described above , which were involved in the functional response of the 5'-flanking regions of the IL-6 gene ( Fig .
2 ) .
Surprisingly , no specific complexes were observed with regions C and D , previously reported to be involved in IL-6 gene regulation by various inducers in other cells systems ( 3 , 4 , 12-16 ) .
Induction of NF- « B Binding Activity by TNF-a in THP-1 Cells without Concomitant IL-6 Production-We investigated the kinetics of NFKB activation in IFN-y- and/or TNF-a-treated THP-1 cells , and LPS-treated cells .

Activated complexes were detectable within 1 h after stimulation with TNF-a alone , as well as with LPS ( Fig .
34 ) .
The binding activity shown after combined treatment with IFN-y and TNF-a was similar to that obtained after treatment with TNF- « alone .
The abundance of the complexes induced by TNF-a alone or combined with IFN-y and by LPS increased throughout 2 h of stimulation without complex mobility change ( Fig .
34 ) .
After LPS treatment , the amount of the complexes increased throughout 4 h of stimula-tion ; in contrast , TNF- « either alone or combined with IFN-y , led to a transient increase for 2 h and dramatically decreased thereafter ( data not shown ) .
The specificity of the protein-DNA complexes was confirmed by complete competition of the binding with unlabeled oligonucleotide A/-73 as well as with the immunoglobulin NFB consensus motif , and the absence of competition with AP-1 or SP1 consensus oligomers ( Fig .
3B ) .
We did not observe any specific binding complexes in untreated cells or in cells stimulated with either IFN-y or IFN-a .
Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against p50 and p65 subunits of NFxB were used to probe the nuclear IL-6-NFxB binding complexes for the presence of corresponding proteins ( Fig .

IFN-y and/or TNF-a , and LPS induce binding of specific nuclear proteins to the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-6 gene .
A representative EMSA analysis showed the specific binding to oligonucleotide probes corresponding to IL-6 promoter fragments : A , -73 to -54 ( lanes 1-6 ) ; B , -126 to -101 ( lanes 7-13 ) , C , -178 to -145 ( lanes 14-19 ) ; D , -207 to -184 ( lanes 20-25 ) ; E , -283 to -242 ( lanes 26-32 ) .
To determine the binding specificity , nuclear extracts from untreated THP-1 cells , or cells treated for 1 h with IFN-y and/or TNF-a or with LPS , were compared by EMSA : lanes 1 , 7 , 14 , 20 , and 26 , untreated nuclear extracts ; lanes 2 , 8 , 15 , 21 , and 27 , IFN-y-treated nuclear extracts ; lanes 3 , 9 , 16 , 22 , and 28 , TNF-o-treated nuclear extracts ; lanes 4 , 10 , 17 , 23 , and 29 , IFN-y + TNF-a-treated nuclear extracts ; lanes 5 , 11 , 18 , 24 , and 30 , LPS-treated nuclear extracts .

paired the formation of the complexes induced by LPS .
Addition of antisera against the NFB subunit p50 did not modify the TNF- « -induced complexes , but those induced by LPS were partially supershifted .
Antibodies against the p52 and c-Rel NFxB subunits did not interact with any of these protein-DNA complexes .
Nevertheless , combined treatment with antibodies against p65 + p52 + c-Rel NFxB subunits appeared to result in the disappearance of the minor residual complex left in TNF-a-treated cell extracts ( data not shown ) .
Results similar to those shown for the TNF- @ -induced complexes were obtained using nuclear extracts of cells stimulated by IFN-y + TNF- « .
These results suggest that p65 is contained in the complexes , whatever the inducers used , whereas p50 only seems to be a constituent of the protein-DNA complexes induced by LPS .
To further investigate the subunit composition of the nuclear IL-6-NFxB binding complexes , nuclear extracts were immuno-precipitated with specific antibodies , and analyzed by Western blot ( Fig .
3C ) .
In agreement with the results shown in Fig .
3B , p65 subunit-NFB was found after stimulation with TNF- « alone , with IFN-y + TNF-a and LPS , whereas antibody against p50 only revealed a major protein of 50 kDa after LPS stimulation ( Fig .
3C ) .
We previously showed that in THP-1 cells , stimulation by combined treatment with IFN-y and TNF-a was required for endogenous IL-6 gene expression and protein secretion , and that TNF-a treatment alone was ineffective ( 22 ) .
Here , however , TNF-a was effective in activating nuclear protein binding to the NFB-like element and in driving CAT expression after transfection with the del ( -73 ) construct containing the NF « B- like sequence .
These observations suggested the presence of a repressive element ( s ) that might negatively affect TNF-o-me-diated transcription of the endogenous IL-6 gene .
Involvement of RCE ( Retinoblastoma Control Element ) in IL-6 Gene Repression in THP-1 Cells : Role of SP1 Protein-It was reported that Rb protein but not its mutants , repress IL-6 promoter transcriptional activity in NIH 3T3 cells ( 17 ) .
This repression was mediated through a cis-acting element , first described in the c-fos promoter ( 46 ) .
The IL-6 promoter contains a G+C-rich sequence between -126 and -104 that includes two CCACC motifs ( -123 to -118 and -109 to -103 ) previously identified as the RB response element ( RCE ) , and one CCGCC motif similar to the Spl-binding site ( -119 to -115 ) ( 12 , 13 ) .
The results shown in Fig .
1 suggest that a cis- DNA element , which is located between -181 and -73 and contains , among others , the RCE motifs , might be involved in repression of IL-6 gene expression in THP-1 cells .
These observations prompted us to investigate the interactions between proteins and the IL-6-RCE sequence in nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells stimulated with various inducers .
For this investigation , we used an oligonucleotide spanning both sites ( B/-126 ) .
EMSA revealed the presence of a major constitutive complex in untreated cells ( Fig .
4A , left section ) .
No major modification was observed after this stimulation .
Complex formation was specific , since it competed with the non-radiolabeled specific oligonucleotide but not with the unrelated oligonucleotide AP-1 ( Fig .
4B ) .
Note that protein-DNA interactions appeared to involve the Spl elements , since binding displayed complete competition with a 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Role of IRF-1 , NFkB , and Sp1 in Human IL-6 Gene Regulation A LPS - < se po < - ] ex e e - go- ] o- - ~ g TNF-C -- # # - clu c t # 2 cfl ct # 2 2 IEN-O | - ~ -- - # ) - ~ z ~ - # ] - < < < l~ + [ FNJY moe R ons Ronee nud ne F ine F ser mae [ rise R wen R ns iman vittem dott atts Bim Ah .

Kinetics of induction of NFxB-binding protein in THP-1 cells .
A , THP-1 cells were stimulated with IFN-y and/or TNF- « , with IFN-a , or with LPS .
Nuclear extracts were prepared after cell stimulation for 0.5 , 1 , or 2 h. EMSA was performed using radiolabeled oligonucleotide A/-73 .
B , specificity of protein-DNA complexes .
EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts from untreated cells ( Cont ) or cells stimulated for 2 h with TNF-a or LPS .
Competition studies were carried out with specific oligonucleotides A/-73 ( -73 ) and consensus NFxB , or with unrelated oligonucleotides AP-1 , B/-126 ( -126 ) , or Sp1 .
In addition , binding studies including antibodies were carried out with two purified rabbit antisera , specifically reactive with p50 or p65 NFkB subunits ( Ab p50 , p65 ) .
NI , nonimmune antiserum added for nonspecific reactions .
C , nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells , either untreated ( Cont ) or treated with various inducers for 2 h , were submitted to immunoprecipitation using either specific antibodies against p50 or p65 NFxB subunits , or nonimmune serum .
After Western blot analysis , specific proteins were revealed with the corresponding antibodies , as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Arrows point to specific p65 ( left ) or p50 ( right ) NFxB subunits .
The relative mass of protein molecular markers is shown in the middle ( Rainbow '' , Amersham ) .
Sp1 consensus motif ( Fig .
4B ) .
Antibodies against purified Spl protein partially supershifted the B/-126 complex , whereas antibodies against Rb protein had no effect on complex formation ( Fig .
4B ) .
Furthermore , addition of purified Sp1 protein to the nuclear extracts led to a higher site occupancy without changing mobility ( Fig .
4B , right section ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that Sp1 is part of the protein-DNA complex formed with B/-126 oligonucleotide .
This oligonucleotide , which encompasses the RCE-IL-6 promoter element , includes the core sequence 5'-CCGCC-3 ' ( -119 to -115 ) , which covers part of the RCE motif ( -123 to -118 ) ; this motif appears to be homologous with the 5'-CCGCCC-3 ' core sequence , reported to be the consensus binding motif in 27925 volved in the interaction with the Sp1 factor .
Furthermore , when we used an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide as the radiolabeled DNA probe in EMSA experiments , a major constitutive complex was revealed ( Fig .
44 , right section ) with a mobility similar to that obtained with the B/-126 probe ( Fig .
4A , left section ) .
The amount of the protein-Sp1 oligonucleotide complex rose slightly after stimulation by IFN-y , TNF-a , LPS , or IFN- « , and rose more markedly after combined stimulation with IFN-y + TNF-a .
Complex formation was impaired by competition with the specific unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide , and partial competition was observed with the B/-126 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4C ) .
As expected , antibodies against the Spl protein led to a supershift of the protein-DNA complex , whereas no effect was observed with pRb antibodies .
In the same way , as for the B/-126 probe complex , addition of Sp1 protein greatly increased the amount of protein-DNA complex revealed with the Sp1 oligonucleotide probe .
To demonstrate the presence of Spl protein in the B/-126 DNA protein complex , we used shift-Western blot analysis , with either the B/-126 probe or the Spl consensus probe .
When a complex was formed with the B/-126 probe ( Fig .
5 , A1 ) , we could not reveal the presence of Rb protein ( A2 ) , whereas the antibodies against Sp1 protein recognized a specific protein whose abundance increased slightly after IFN-y + TNF-a treatment ( A3 ) .
The antibodies against Rb protein identified a faint lower band , probably corresponding to free Rb protein ( Fig .
5 , A2 ) .
As expected , in a similar experiment using a radiolabeled Sp1 probe ( Fig .
5B ) , antibodies against Sp1 protein revealed a specific protein contained in the protein-DNA complex ( B3 ) ; the amount of Sp1 protein correlated with the amount of DNA probe bound to this complex ( B1 ) , which increased after IFN-y + TNF-a treatment ( B3 ) .
A faint lower band was also seen , probably corresponding to free Spl protein .
With pRb antibodies , no protein was revealed in the protein-DNA complex , and as in the experiment using the B/-126 probe , a lower band was detected , corresponding to free Rb protein ( Fig .
5 , B2 ) .
Immunoprecipitation of crude nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells stimulated with IFN-y alone or combined to TNF-a , using antibodies against Sp1 protein , dramatically raised the level of the 95-kDa native Sp1 protein as shown by Western blot analysis ( Fig .
4D , upper section ) .
To demonstrate that the effect of IFN-y or IFN-y + TNF-a « correlated with the activation of Sp1 protein , the same immuno-Western blot was hybridized with a monoclonal anti-phosphoserine antibody .
Fig .
4D ( lower section ) shows an increase in phosphorylated Sp1 protein , previously reported to be the active form of this nuclear factor ( 36 ) .
These results correlate well with the increase in binding activity shown by EMSA performed with the Sp1 probe after THP-1 cell treatment with IFN-y + TNF-a ( Fig .
4A , right section ) .
Taken together , these results suggest the involvement of the Sp1 protein in the protein-DNA interaction of the RCE present in the IL-6 promoter .
Although we can not exclude the possibility that other factors interact with the RCE-IL-6 promoter , shift- Western blot and antibody-supershift experiments nevertheless suggest that Spl is part of the activity that interacts with this region .
Regulation of IRF-1 and IRF -2 in the Synergistic Induction of IL-6 Gene Expression by IFN-y + TNF-o-Functional analysis ( Fig .
1 ) showed that a distal element between -1200 and -224 regulates positively the response to IFN-y alone , or combined with TNF-a .
EMSA using probe E/-283 , and encompassing a copy of the IFN enhancer core sequence , revealed the formation of 2 protein-DNA complexes , one of which was specifically induced by IFN-y treatment ( Fig .
2 ) .

Specificity of protein binding to RB control elements .
A , EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells , either untreated or stimulated for 0.5 h with IFN-y and/or TNF-a , LPS , or IFN-a , using radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide B/- 126 ( left section ) , or radiolabeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide ( right section ) .
B , nuclear extracts of cells left untreated for 0.5 h ( Cont ) were submitted to EMSA using the B/-126 radiolabeled probe to reveal specific competition between RCE-binding proteins and either unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide B/-126 or Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide .
AP-1 unlabeled oligonucleotide was used as unrelated competitor .
Nuclear extracts of untreated cells ( Cont ) or IFN-y-treated cells were preincubated with antibodies ( A5 ) against Rb protein ( Rb ) or against Sp1 protein ( Sp1 ) , and radiolabeled probe B/-126 was then added .
Recombinant Sp1 protein ( 1.0 footprinting units ) was mixed with nuclear extract of untreated cells ( Cont ) or cells treated with IFN-y , and radiolabeled B/-126 probe was then added ( right section ) .

Induction and specificity of IFN-y regulated IRF-1/ IRF-2 complexes .
Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide E/-283 was used for EMSA .
A , binding reactions were tested with nuclear extracts prepared from untreated THP-1 cells or cells treated with various inducers for 0.5 , 1 , or 2 h. Arrows indicate C1- and C2-specific protein-DNA complexes .
B , nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells treated for 2 h with IFN-y + TNF- « were used to determine the specificity of the two complexes by means of the following unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides : E/-283 without mutation ( -283 ) , or with mutation ( mt ) in the AP-1 motif ( mt 15 ) or in the IFN enhancer core sequence ( mt 31 ) , ISRE , and C3 .
Oligonucleotides AP-1 , B/-126 ( -126 ) and Sp1 were used as nonspecific competitors .
C , before addition of radiolabeled probe E/-283 , nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells treated with IFN-y + TNF-a for 2 h were preincubated with antibodies against IRF-2 , IRF-1 , or nonimmune antiserum ( NZ ) .
induced a second protein-DNA complex ( C2 ) , which was not observed after TNF-a or LPS stimulation .
EMSA carried out with nuclear extracts of cells treated with IFN-a « for 2 h revealed a faint C2 complex .
To define the sequence specificity of the C1 and C2 complexes , competition experiments were performed with synthetic oligonucleotides representing several mutations of the -283 to -242 region either in the putative interferon enhancer core sequence 5'-AAAGG-3 ' ( -283/mt31 ) or in the AP1 motif ( -283/mt15 ) , and also with the ISRE of the 2',5'-oligo ( A ) synthetase gene promoter , known to be implicated in IFN responses ( 43 ) , and with the C3 oligonucleotide defined by its IRF-1-binding activity ( 44 ) .
Oligonucleotide E/-283 and the mutant -283/mt15 competed for the formation of both complexes ( Fig .
6B , mt 15 ) , whereas the mutant -283/mt31 lost this capacity ( Fig .
6B , mt 31 ) , indicating that the IFN enhancer core sequence 5'-AAAGG-3 ' was involved in the DNA-protein interaction .
Complete competition for the C1 and C2 complexes was observed with the ISRE and C3 oligonucleotides .
A trimer AP-1 motif was not able to compete for either complex , in agreement with the behavior of mutant -283/mt15 .
No competition was observed neither with the Sp1 nor with B/-126 oligonucleotides ( Fig .
6B ) .
To investigate the possible relationship between the C1 and C2 complexes and ISGF3 ( 25-27 , 47 ) , nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells treated for 2 h with IFN-a @ were tested for their binding activity , using the E/-283 , ISRE , or C3 oligonucleotides as DNA radiolabeled probes ( Fig .
7 ) .
The pattern of the protein-DNA complexes was very similar with the E/-283 and C3 oligonucleotide probes , suggesting that they bind the IRF-l-related factor .
For ISRE-DNA-protein binding , only IFN-a treatment resulted in a double upper-induced binding activity 27927 LPS somers sep m -o- = mq o- omo - = g TNF-Q - - # 4+ .

E/-283 , CS-radiolabeled oligonucleotides , and ISRE : -radiolabeled oligonucleotide gave different patterns of the protein-DNA complexes .
Nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells treated for 2 h with IFN-y , TNF-a , IFN-y + TNF-a , LPS , or IFN- « were tested for their binding activity , using oligonucleotides radiolabeled with E/-283 ( eft section ) , C3 ( middle section ) , or ISRE ( right section ) .
Double arrows indicate specific protein-DNA complexes .
ISRE ( Fig .
7 ) ; several constitutive complexes showed no quantitative or qualitative changes , whatever the inducers used .
These results suggest that C1 and C2 complexes did not involve ISGF3 , but rather IRF-1/IRF-2 , unlike the IFN- @ -induced complexes revealed with the ISRE probe .
As shown in Fig .
6C , the amount of constitutive DNA-binding C1 complex was markedly reduced by the IRF -2 antibodies , while the inducible complex C2 was supershifted by the IRF-1 antibodies .
The IRF-1 antibodies also abolished the time-dependent increase in the C1 complex , which remained at its constitutive level .
These results demonstrate that IRF-2 is involved in the formation of the constitutive C1 complex , and that IRF-1 is involved both in the formation of the inducible C2 complex and in the increase in the amount of C1 complex .
To establish whether this typical IRF recognition sequence is sufficient for IFN-y activation and for the synergistic action of IFN-y with TNF-a « , we constructed mutated IL-6 promoter CAT expression plasmids .
For this purpose , we linked oligonucleotide E/-283 , or oligonucleotide -283/mt31 , which carried a mutation in the putative IFN enhancer core sequence AAAGGA ( -253 to -248 ) , to del ( -224 ) -CAT and called the resulting constructs del ( -224 ) /E and del ( -224 ) /Emt31 , respectively ( Fig .
14 ) .
These constructs were then transfected into THP-1 cells .
As shown in Fig .
1B , the relative induction of CAT activity after THP-1 transfection with construct del ( -224 ) /E demonstrated that the IFN enhancer core sequence is sufficient to confer responsiveness to IFN-y , because the mutation of the AAAGGA motif ( see del ( -224 ) /Emt31 ) abolished IFN-y sensi-tivity ; the IFN-y + TNF-a synergistic induction was preserved , although to a much smaller extent ( 2-fold induction ) .
These results suggest that in addition to the IFN enhancer core sequence , surrounding sequences might contribute to the synergistic effect of IFN-y with TNF-a .
Transfection of either of the constructs del ( -224 ) /E or del ( -224 ) /mt31 resulted in a similar LPS-induced increase in CAT activity ( 7- and 6-fold , respectively ) , showing that the IFN enhancer core sequence did not play an essential role in LPS induction ( Fig .
1 ) .
However , LPS inducibility required the cooperation of other ( s ) factor ( s ) , as demonstrated by the progressive reduction of CAT activity after the transfection of IL-6 promoter 5 ' end successive deletions .
These results showed that IFN-y + TNF-a and LPS induced the IL-6 gene by different pathways .

Modulation of IRF-1 or IRF-2 proteins .
A , nuclear extracts of untreated THP-1 cells ( CONT ) or cells treated with various inducers for 30 min ( upper section ) or for 2 h ( lower section ) were submitted to immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies against IRF-1 or IRF-2 , followed by Western blot analysis .
IRF-2 protein was analyzed after treatment of THP-1 cells for 30 min or 2 h by various inducers , whereas IRF-1 protein was analyzed after cell stimulation for 2 h. Middle arrows indicate the relative mass of protein molecular weight markers .
Left or right external arrows indicate specific IRF-2 or IRF-1 proteins .
B , in vitro translation : total RNAs were extracted from cells left untreated for 2 h ( Cont ) or stimulated for 2 h , and were translated in vitro at a concentration of 480 ug total RNA/m ! , using reticulocyte lysate and under defined optimal conditions ( 97 mM KCl and 1.8 mm Mg ( CH , COO ) ; ) .
After incubation of 1 h at 32 °C , volume aliquots corresponding to 5 x 10° cpm of labeled polypeptides were submitted to immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis , as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Differential Regulation of IRF-1 and IRF-2 Expression by IFN-y or LPS-Previous reports have shown that the IRF-1 and IRF-2 factors display antagonist activities , and that the up-regulation of the binding activity of one factor results in the down-regulation of the binding activity of the other ( 28-32 ) .
Our demonstration that the binding activities of IRF-1 and IRF-2 correlated with the synergistic induction of IL-6 promoter by IFN-y + TNF-a ( Fig .
6 ) prompted us to compare the regulation of IRF-1/IRF-2 by IFN-y , TNF-a , or IFN-y + TNF-a with their regulation by IFN- « .
For this purpose immuno-Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells after 2 h of stimulation was performed using antibodies against IRF-1 or IRF-2 .
A polypeptide of 42 kDa was revealed by the IRF-1 antibodies , but only after stimulation by IFN-y or IFN-y + TNF-a ( Fig .
8A , right section ) .
The IRF-2 antibodies detected a constitutive IRF-2 protein whose abundance was not modified after cell treatment with IFN-y or TNF-a either alone or combined for 2 h. In contrast , treatment with LPS or IFN- « reduced the amount of IRF-2 protein ( Fig .
8A , left section ) .
Since formation of the constitutive C1 complex involved IRF-2 protein binding ( see Fig .
6C ) , we attempted to establish whether a transient modulation of this protein occurred soon after stimulation .
As shown in Fig .
8A ( left section ) , treatment with IFN-y + TNF- « , LPS , or IFN- « reduced the level of IRF-2 protein in nuclear extracts of cells stimulated for 30 min .
The effect of TNF-a was transient , because the reduction in the amount of IRF-2 protein was not seen in nuclear extracts of cells that had been stimulated for 2 h. In contrast , the inhibition by IFN-a or LPS of the IRF-2 protein level lasted throughout the 2 h of stimulation .
Since the amount of IRF-2 protein diminished after cell stimulation by IFN-y + TNF-a , LPS , or IFN-a , whereas IRF-1 protein was only induced by IFN-y , we explored this effect to see if it was related to an increase in IRF-1 and ( or ) a decrease in IRF-2 gene expressions .
For this purpose , total RNAs were extracted after 0.5 , 1 , or 2 h from cells stimulated with various inducers and then analyzed by Northern blot .

Total RNAs ( 15 ug ) of THP-1 cells treated with the indicated inducers for 0.5 , 1 , or 2 h were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with the IRF-l-radiolabeled probe .
After dehybridization , the same membrane transfer was successively hybridized with IRF-2 and actin probes .
Arrows indicate specific mRNA .
9 , IFN-y already induced IRF-1 mRNA after 30 min , in an amount which increased for up to 2 h of cell stimulation .
No synergistic effect was observed after combined treatment with IFN-y and TNF- @ .
Stimulation by IFN-a « also triggered IRF-1 gene expression , but with different kinetics of accumulation since IRF-1 mRNA was barely detected after 1 h of IFN- @ stimulation but its amount increased thereafter .
Two IRF-1 mRNAs of 2.1 and 3 kilobases were revealed , with a similar accumulation kinetic .
Neither TNF-a @ nor LPS induced IRF-1 gene expression in THP-1 cells .
In contrast , IRF-2 mRNA was constitutively expressed ( Fig .
9 ) .
No significant modification of the IRF-2 mRNA level was observed whatever the period of incubation and the inducers used .
The reduction in the level of this protein after stimula-tions with various inducers , without concomitant decrease in 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Role of IRF-1 , NFkB , and Sp1 in Human IL-6 Gene Regulation the IRF-2 mRNA level , prompted us to make sure that IRF-2 mRNA was functionally active .
Accordingly , total RNAs were extracted from cells left untreated from 2 h or stimulated for 2 h and translated in vitro , using reticulocyte lysate and thionine .
Identical number of counts/min ( 5 X 10° cpm ) were analyzed by immuno-Western blot , using specific IRF-2 antibodies .
Similar amounts of IRF-2 protein were detected whatever the inducers used ( Fig .
8B ) .
These results indicate that the differential regulation of IRF-2 protein by IFN-y , LPS , and IFN-a takes place at post translational level .
DISCUSSION We investigated the molecular basis for the IFN-y/TNF- @ -mediated synergistic induction of the human IL-6 gene in the THP-1 monocytic cell line by functional analysis of this gene 's promoter .
The results provided evidence that three regions inside this promoter are the targets of the IFN-y/TNF-a action : ( i ) a region between -73 and -36 , which constitutes the minimal element inducible by LPS or TNF-a ; ( ii ) an element located between -181 and -73 , which appears to regulate negatively the response to IFN-y and TNF-a ; and ( iii ) a distal element upstream of -224 , which is the only one inducible by IFN-y alone .
Each of the DNA elements corresponding to the three functional regions inducible by IFN-y and/or TNF-a and by LPS led to the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes .
The IL-6 promoter DNA fragment between -73 and -36 was found to contain an NFxB-like element near a putative AP-1 binding motif .
In THP-1 cells , TNF-a or LPS induced binding to this DNA motif , whereas IFN-y neither induced NFB binding activity nor amplified the effect of TNF-a when added together with it .
The EMSA-DNA competition experiments with consensus immunoglobulin- « B oligonucleotide allowed us to conclude that the formation of the complexes induced by TNF-a and LPS is due to NFB binding factors .
EMSA including antibodies and immunoprecipitation with anti-p50 and anti-p65 NFB subunit antibodies revealed only the nuclear accumulation of p50 and p65 after stimulation by LPS .
The predominance of the p65 subunit was shown to be the major factor induced by TNF-a or IFN-y + TNF-a .
Various dimer combinations of induced factors have been reported to be stimulus-dependent and to display distinct DNA binding specificities by activating distinct sets ot target genes ( 23 ) .
Thus , homodimer p65 was previously shown to be selectively activated in other systems by TNF- « ( 48 , 49 ) .
In THP-1 cells , the induction of NFxB binding activity by TNF-a did not correlate with concomitant IL-6 production ( 22 ) , but required the addition of IFN-y , unlike activation by LPS .
This indicated that the mechanism involved in the induction of endogenous IL-6 gene in THP-1 cells is inducer-specific .
Although NFB binding factors are certainly involved in IL-6 gene induction , the functional analysis of IL-6-CAT construct deletions reported here shows that significantly greater stimulation of the CAT reporter gene is obtained for constructs that contain the 5 ' distal sequence of IL-6 promoter ( pr-1200 ) .
Successive deletions of the 5 end of the IL-6 promoter fragment ( -1200 to -108 ) resulted in the gradual reduction of synergistic CAT activity by IFN-y + TNF- « .
EMSA using the oligonucleotide E/-283 , which contains a copy of IFN-enhancer-core sequence , showed that IFN-y , but not TNF-a or LPS , induced specific binding activity .
Similar results were obtained with C3 oligonucleotide , suggesting that an IRF-l-related factor was a component of the C1- and C2-specific protein-DNA complexes .
EMSA experiments using antibodies against IRF-1 or IRF -2 allowed us to conclude that the formation of the constitutive C1 complex involved IRF-2 binding and that IRF-1 was involved , both in the binding activity 27929 of the inducible C2 complex and in the increased abundance of the C1 complex due to stimulation by IFN-y .
In agreement with these findings , transfection of construct del ( -224 ) /Emt31 into THP-1 cells confirmed that the IFN-enhancer-core sequence AAAGG , which is located between -253 and -248 ( 13 ) , is sufficient to induce the response to IFN-y alone .
The IRF-1 binding site identified in the IL-6 promoter was shown to be the central motif of the IFN-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) found in the promoter of IFN-o-stimulated genes such as the 2',5'-oligo ( A ) -synthetase gene ( 43 ) .
In EMSA using the E/-283 probe , the IRF-related complexes C1 and C2 were impaired by the ISRE oligonucleotide .
However , after IFN-a treatment , no C1 or C2 binding activity was observed .
When EMSA was performed with the ISRE oligonucleotide for purposes of comparison , it only revealed ISGF3-related complexes after IFN-a treatment , as expected ( 24-27 ) .
Induction of IRF-1 protein-DNA binding by IFN-y correlated with the induction of IRF-1 mRNA and with the concomitant IRF-1 protein synthesis .
On the other hand , IRF-2 mRNA constitutive expression was not modified whatever the inducers , whereas the level of constitutive IRF-2 protein decreased transiently after IFN-y + TNF-a treatment .
LPS or IFN- « treatment led to the disappearance of the constitutive IRF-2 protein .
The different effects exerted on IRF-2 protein down-regulation by IFN-y + TNF- « on the one hand and by LPS on the other might partly account for the difference between the magnitude of IL-6 induction by each of these inducers in monocytic THP-1 cells .
LPS was recently shown to induce or activate proteins that recognize the 3'-end instability sequence of an mRNA that prevents the latter 's translation ( 50-52 ) .
Such a mechanism might account for the down-regulation of IRF-2 protein in vivo , since here we were unable to show by Northern blot analysis that this inducer modulates either the expression of mRNA IRF-2 or its translation in vitro .
Alternatively , the constitutive IRF-2 protein might be rapidly degraded after its activation by IFN-y or LPS , as shown in other systems ( 53 ) , thus allowing the binding of another activator which in the case of IFN-y would be IRF-1 .
As LPS did not , under our experimental conditions , induce IRF-1 , we might be justified in assuming that one or several other factors activated by LPS could act as a transcriptional factor , as suggested by our functional CAT analysis ( Fig .
1B ) .
Our results suggest that IRF-1 may be a critical downstream signaling factor involved in IFN-y signal transduction in mono-cytes/macrophages , particularly for genes whose maximal expression is triggered by combined treatment with IFN-y + TNF-a ( 22 , 54-56 ) .
The fact that TNF-a induced NFB binding activity , which correlated with the inducibility of the del ( -73 ) -CAT construct but failed to induce reporter constructs containing additional upstream sequences , suggests that a silencer of NFxB activity must be present in the IL-6 promoter .
Functional analysis of deletion constructs indicated that this negative element might be located between -181 and -73 .
This region contains , among others , a retinoblastoma control element known to be involved in pRb-mediated repression of the c-fos promoter ( 46 ) .
The presence , as reported by Santhanam et al. , of a region analogous to the RCE in the IL-6 promoter between positions -126/ -101 , exhibiting similar patterns of c-fos and IL-6 promoters regulation , suggests that RCE may be involved in IL-6 gene repression in monocytic cells .
Evidence that RCE has a repressor role was obtained , in NIH 3T3 cells , by deletion experiments and cotransfections of IL-6 promoter with pRB express 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 27930 ing vector ( 17 ) .
It is tempting to suggest that alteration ( s ) in the interaction between the putative suppressor factor ( s ) and RCE allowed us to obtain a synergistic effect of IFN-y with TNF-a « in THP-1 cells .
Synergistic CAT induction was observed for del ( -181 ) but not for del ( -108 ) .
The del ( -181 ) -CAT construct contains the intact IL-6-RCE motif , whereas a truncated RCE motif is present in the del ( -108 ) -CAT construct .
EMSA experiments performed with oligonucleotide B/-126 , which contains the IL-6-RCE motif , revealed one major constitutive specific RCE-protein complex in nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells .
This complex was completely inhibited by consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide and was supershifted by Sp1 antibodies .
In addition , recombinant Sp1 protein increased this site occupancy .
Furthermore , we showed by shift-Western blot analysis that Sp1 protein is part of the IL-6-RCE-protein complex , whereas Rb protein , undetectable in this complex , was not .
Our observations are in agreement with the hypothesis proposed by Udvadia et al .
that Rb regulates transcription partly by virtue of its ability to interact functionally with RB control proteins , including Sp1 ( 45 , 57-60 ) .
EMSA performed with the Sp1 consensus probe showed that stimulation of THP-1 cells by IFN-y + TNF- « enhanced the amount of the protein-DNA complex .
This result correlates with a marked increase by IFN-y in the amount of serine-phosphorylated Sp1 protein .
It has been shown that Spl is selectively phosphorylated upon binding to its cognate recognition elements on DNA , suggesting that phosphorylation represents an early event in the processes leading to transcriptional activation by Spl .
Phosphorylation of Sp1 is catalyzed by a double-stranded DNA-dependent kinase and requires binding to DNA containing the GC box ( 34 , 61 ) .
It is tempting to postulate that the effect of IFN-y was partly mediated by increased binding of Sp1 to its target sequence in the IL-6 promoter , with concomitant Sp1 factor activation by specific phosphorylation .
This alteration might impair the negative effect mediated by the IL-6-RCE .
On the other hand , NFB has been shown to synergize with a number of transcription factors , including Sp1 ( 62 , 63 ) .
It has been reported that Sp1 specifically interacts with the N-terminal region of Rel A ( p65 ) ; similarly , Rel A ( p65 ) bound directly to the zinc finger region of Spl factor .
This interaction is specific , because Rel A did not associate with several other transcription factors known to be zinc finger proteins ( 36-38 ) .
Since the p65 homodimer induced by TNF-a in THP-1 cells is not , by itself , sufficient to induce IL-6 gene expression , we can postulate that functional interaction between p65 NFxB and the activated-Sp1 bound to the adjacent target Sp1 site contributed to the induction of the IL-6 gene .
Our observations allowed us to conclude that IL-6 gene expression in THP-1 cells by IFN-y + TNF-a @ , or by LPS treatment is mediated through different signaling pathways .
LPS signaling was shown to involve interaction with CD14 ( 64 , 65 ) , which triggered the mitogen-activated protein kinase Ras-Rafl-dependent cascade , leading to IxB phosphorylation and subsequent translocation allowing accumulation of the p50/p65 NFB heterodimer in the nucleus ( 23 , 66-68 ) .
Since this p50/p65 complex was also identified in our cell system , a similar pathway might be responsible for the IL-6 gene expression induced by LPS treatment in THP-1 cells .
In contrast , the synergistic effect of IFN-y + TNF-a on IL-6 gene induction in THP-1 cells might involve three simultaneous processes .
The first process is the activation of NFB by TNF-a by a different pathway from that of activation by LPS , Role of IRF-1 , NFkB , and Sp1 in Human IL-6 Gene Regulation leading to the activation of the p65 homodimer .
This possibility is supported by a recent report showing that , in murine macro-phages , TNF-a activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase-dependent but c-Raf-l-independent fashion ( 69 ) .
The second process is the induction of IRF-1 by IFN-y through a signaling pathway involving the activation of Jak1/Jak2 and Stat 1 ( 70-75 ) .
The third process is a concomitant change by IFN-y , in the state of phosphorylation and abundance of the constitutive Sp1 nuclear factor interacting with IL-6-RCE .
The phosphoserine kinase implicated in the signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of Sp1 , presumably activated by IFN-y , remains to be investigated .
Transcriptional induction of the IL-6 gene might result from a coordinated effect exerted by factor Sp1 together with IRF-1 and p65 homodimer-NFxB .
The fact that regulation by IFN-y of the IL-6 gene in human monocytes involved IRF-1 may be more generally related to the tumor suppressor/differentiation properties of IFN-y ( 82 , 76 ) .
Deletion of a chromosomal segment that contains the IRF-1 gene , mapped in chromosome 5q31.1 , is very often observed in human leukemia ( 77 ) .
It is therefore possible that an alteration in the balance of IRF-1/IRF-2 may impair optimal physiological induction of IL-6 by IFN-y/TNF-a @ in the monocytic cell com-partment , leading to abnormal cell maturation and proliferation in certain hematological disorders and to neoplasia .
Alterations in IL-6 production such as overexpression in multiple myeloma and other type of cancers ( 2-9 , 78 , 79 ) or inhibition in Fanconi 's anemia ( 10 , 80 ) may be suspected to play a role in pathological cell growth and to affect hematopoi-etic cell differentiation .
In this regard , the fact that the triggering of IL-6 gene expression by IFN-y in monocytic cells required the induction of IRF-1 and involved phosphorylated Sp1 protein may be of physiological relevance , and one of the important homeostatic properties of IFN-y within the cytokine network .
