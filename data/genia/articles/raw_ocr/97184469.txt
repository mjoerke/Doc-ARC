3 Characterization of a Mutant Cell Line That Does Not Activate NF-kB in Response to Multiple Stimuli GILLES COURTOIS , ' SIMON T. WHITESIDE , ' CAROL H. SIBLEY , '' anp ALAIN ISRAEL ' !
* Unité de Biologie Moléculaire de l'Expression Génique , UMR 321 CNRS , Institut Pasteur , 75724 Paris Cedex 15 , France , '' and Department of Genetics , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington 98195 % Received 5 September 1996/Returned for modification 28 October 1996/Accepted 10 December 1996 Numerous genes required during the immune or inflammation response as well as the adhesion process are regulated by nuclear factor xB ( NF-KB ) .
Associated with its inhibitor , IB , NF-KB resides as an inactive form in the cytoplasm .
Upon stimulation by various agents , IB is proteolyzed and NF-KB translocates to the nucleus , where it activates its target genes .
The transduction pathways that lead to IB inactivation remain poorly understood .
In this study , we have characterized a cellular mutant , the 70/Z3-derived 1.3E2 murine pre-B cell line , that does not activate NF-B in response to several stimuli .
We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide , Taxol , phorbol myristate acetate , interleukin-1 , or double-stranded RNA , IxBa is not degraded , as a result of an absence of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36 .
Neither a mutation in IxBa nor a mutation in p50 or relA , the two major subunits of NF-KB in this cell line , accounts for this phosphorylation defect .
As well as culminating in the inducible phosphorylation of IxBa on serines 32 and 36 , all the stimuli that are inactive on 1.3E2 cells exhibit a sensitivity to the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) .
In contrast , stimuli such as hyperosmotic shock or phosphatase inhibitors , which use PDTC-insensitive pathways , induce IxBa degradation in 1.3E2 .
Analysis of the redox status of 1.3E2 does not reveal any difference from wild-type 702/3 .
We also report that the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -derived Tax trans-activator induces NF-KB activity in 1.3E2 , suggesting that this viral protein does not operate via the defective pathway .
Finally , we show that two other IB molecules , IBB and the recently identified IxBsg , are not degraded in the 1.3E2 cell line following stimulation .
Our results demonstrate that 1.3E2 is a cellular transduction mutant exhibiting a defect in a step that is required by several different stimuli to activate NF-KB .
In addition , this analysis suggests a common step in the signaling pathways that trigger IxBa , IBB , and IxBzg degradation .
The NF-xB/rel family of transcription factors plays a crucial role in the expression of numerous genes that participate in the immune or inflammatory response and in the adhesion processes ( for a review , see references 3 , 18 , 51 , and 59 ) .
In addition , these factors are required for the transcription of several viruses , among them human immunodeficiency virus type 1 .
NF- « B molecules are homo- or heterodimeric combinations of rel-related proteins .
Members of this family are p50 , p52 , relA , relB , and c-rel ( 8 , 9 , 19 , 24 , 33 , 37 , 42-44 , 46 , 62 ) .
They all share a conserved domain , the rel homology domain , that participates in DNA binding and dimerization .
In most cell types , NF-B resides in the cytoplasm in a latent form that is associated with the inhibitor IxB .
IxB retains NF-kB in the cytoplasm by masking its nuclear localization signal .
In response to multiple stimuli , including phorbol es-ters , cytokines , bacterial lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) , and viral products , the inhibitor is inactivated and NF- « B translocates to the nucleus , where it activates its target genes .
Three major IxB molecules , IxBa , IxBB and IxBg , have been identified ( 21 , 55 , 61 ) .
Important progress has been made concerning the mode of inactivation of IxBa « .
It has been shown that the induced phosphorylation of IxBa on Ser 32 and 36 targets the molecule for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome complex ( 4 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 16 , 22 , 32 , 45 , 54 , 57 , 60 ) .
In addition , by using proteasome inhibitors , it has been demonstrated that the phosphorylated form of IxBa * Corresponding author .

1441 remains associated with NF- « B , indicating that the proteolysis step is absolutely required to inactivate IxBa ( 1 , 15 , 17 , 35 , 56 ) .
The recent cloning of IxBB and IxBg has not yet allowed a detailed analysis of their mode of inactivation .
Nevertheless , like IxBa , IxBB and IxBg are degraded in response to stimulation ( 16 , 31 , 55 , 61 ) .
In both cases , this degradation process involves the proteasome complex and requires two serine residues that are located in a sequence motif similar to that of Ser 32 and 36 of IxBa ( 16 , 31 , 61 ) .
As indicated above , a large number of stimuli are able to activate NF-kB .
However , if the final target of several of them is Ser 32 and 36 of IxBa , suggesting the involvement of a regulated kinase or phosphatase , the intermediate steps are poorly defined .
Since various antioxidants are able to inhibit NF-kB activation ( 34 , 49 , 52 ) , one of them could be redox regulated .
Alternatively , oxidants themselves have been shown to activate NF- « B in certain cell types , suggesting that reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) , such as superoxides or H,0 , ; , could be second messengers common to all NF-kB activators ( 47-49 ) .
By analogy with procaryotic or lower eucaryotic systems , the isolation of mammalian cellular mutants , allowing a genetic analysis of the NF- « B activation process , would be very useful .
Such a mutant , the murine pre-B 70Z/3-derived 1.3E2 cell line , was isolated several years ago by selecting cells unable to express surface immunoglobulin M after LPS treatment ( 29 ) .
When the activation of NF-kB by LPS or phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) was tested , no inducible DNA-binding activity could be detected in the nucleus .
Importantly , such a defect was not a result of a problem of p50 or relA synthesis since , when the detergent deoxycholate was used , a latent form of 1442 COURTOIS ET AL .
NF-kB was observed in the cytoplasmic compartment ( 39 ) .
The recessive nature of the defect was demonstrated by fusing 1.3E2 with wild-type ( wt ) 70Z/3 .
The resulting hybrid cell was able to activate NF-kB upon stimulation ( reference 29 and unpublished results ) .
In this study , we have characterized the 1.3E2 cell line more thoroughly .
We demonstrate that IxBa , IxBB , and IxBg are not degraded in response to a large number of stimuli .
Moreover , in the case of IxBa , we also show a lack of induced phosphorylation on Ser 32 and 36 .
These data suggest that 1.3E2 represents a cellular transduction mutant that is deficient in a crucial component of the NF- « B activation process .
Such a component appears to be required for inducing IxBa , IxBB , and IxBg degradation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
wt 702Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and 50 M B-mercaptocthanol .
Stable cell lines were prepared as described previously ( 60 ) with plasmids Re/CMV-B-IxBa-wt ( 60 ) for stable cells expressing human IxBa ( hIxBa ) , Re/CMV-p105Rsa ( 24 , 36 ) for cell lines expressing hp50 , Re/CMV-Flag-p65 ( a kind gift of J. Didonato ) for cell lines expressing Flag-p65 , and cDNA3BIxB-£45k ( 61 ) for cell lines expressing hIxBe .
Reagents .

The supernatant , containing the nuclear fraction , was recovered and quickly frozen on dry ice .
Samples were stored at -20°C .
Western blot analysis .
Proteins from cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-10 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellu-lose membranes ( Schleicher & Schuell ) .
After being blocked in 3 % milk-PBS , the membranes were incubated in 0.3 % milk/PBS containing a 1:1,000 dilution of the relevant antibody .
When the 4G10 antibody was used , 5 % bovine serum albumin instead of 3 % milk was used .
After 1 h at room temperature , the membranes were washed for 30 min with three changes in 0.05 % Tween 20-PBS .
Immobilized antigen-antibody conjugates were detected with horseradish perox-idase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulins ( Biosys ) in 0.3 % milk-PBS .
After three washes in 0.05 % Tween 20-PBS , the blots were analyzed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( ECL ; Amer-sham ) .

Cytoplasmic extracts prepared from 10 '' cells were resuspended in 1 ml of TNT buffer ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X-100 ) .
Antibody ( 3 to 5 pl ) was added , and the samples were gently rocked at 4°C for 1 h. A 50-pl volume of Pansorbin ( Calbiochem ) , previously equilibrated in TNT , was added , and the incubation was continued for 30 min .
After three washes in TNT ( 30 s in a microcentrifuge ) , the Pansorbin pellets were resuspended in 1X Laemmli buffer , containing 10 % B-mercaptocthanol , for 15 min at room temperature to recover the antigen-antibody conjugate .
After being boiled for 5 min , the samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed as described above .

Luciferase determination was carried out in a Berthold luminometer .
Analysis of ROI levels by fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) .
Cells ( 10° ) in PBS were incubated with 5 M 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein ( DCFH ) diac-etate ( Fluka ) in dimethylformamide at 37°C .
Aliquots of 10° cells were then scanned on a FACSSORT ( Beckton Dickinson ) with excitation and emission settings of 495 and 525 nm , respectively ( 6 ) .
RESULTS LPS does not induce phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa in 1.3E2 .
It has recently been shown that degradation of IxBa is a prerequisite for NF-kB activation .
We therefore analyzed the fate of IxBa after stimulation by LPS in the 1.3E2 mutant cell line .
As shown in Fig .
1A , no obvious degradation of IxBa was detected after 1 h whereas the same treatment of wt 70Z , /3 resulted in complete disappearance of IxBa within 40 min .
Concomitantly , we did not observe any p50/relA , p50/p50 ( Fig .
1B ) or c-rel/relA ( not shown ) accumulation in the nucleus , as judged by EMSA .
As a consequence , activation of a NF- « B-driven reporter plasmid appeared strongly reduced ( see below , Fig .
6A ) .
Recent reports have demonstrated that stimulation of various cell lines with LPS , PMA , or tumor necrosis factor induces phosphorylation of IxBa on Ser 32 and 36 and that such a modification targets the inhibitor for rapid degradation by the proteasome .
Although IxBa-induced phosphorylation is tran-sient , it can be detected by using proteasome inhibitors which stabilize phosphorylated IxBa in the cytoplasm .
In the case of the human protein , an upshifted band can be easily detected after migration on a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
Stable wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 clones expressing hlkBa ( hereafter referred to as the Zha and Eha cell lines , respectively ) were therefore prepared ( Fig .
2A ) and checked first for the response of the exogenous hlkBa « to LPS .
In each case , hlkBa responded identically to the endogenous mlkBa ( Fig .
2B ) , indicating that IxBa was not mutated in 1.3E2 .
Preincubation of the cell lines with the proteasome inhibitor aLLnL , before LPS treatment , allowed the detection of a retarded phosphorylated hIxBa band in Zha cells but not in Eha cells ( Fig .
2C , compare lanes 2 and 6 ) .
Although this observation was strongly suggestive of a defect Vor .

( B ) Western blot analysis of IxBa levels in Zha and Eha following exposure to 15 ug of LPS per ml for the indicated times .
( C ) Analysis of hIxBa-induced phosphorylation in Zhe and Eha cell lines .
Cells were preincubated for 45 min with 100 M aLLnL and then left untreated for 1 h ( lanes 1 and 5 ) or stimulated with 15 g of LPS per ml ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , 100 ng of PMA per ml ( lanes 3 and 7 ) , or 20 ng of IL-1 per ml ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts from Zhe and Eha were analyzed by Western blotting .
The relative migrations of phosphorylated hIxBa « ( P-hIxBa ) , hi « xBa and mIxBa are indicated on the left .
located at a step preceding IxBa phosphorylation , we could not formally dismiss the existence of a mutation in 1.3E2 at the level of p50 or relA that would affect the phosphorylation process .

To solve this prob-lem , we prepared stable wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cell lines expressing human p50 ( Fig .
3A ) or tagged murine relA ( Fig .
3C ) and compared the fate of these exogenously introduced proteins to that of their endogenous counterparts .
An exogenous human p50 protein stably introduced either into wt 70Z/3 or into 1.3E2 cells behaved similarly to the endogenous p50 ; i.e. , it translocated into the nucleus of 70Z/3 after LPS stimulation whereas it did not in 1.3E2 ( Fig .
3B ) .
This observation indicated that p50 was fully functional in 1.3E2 .
A similar conclusion was reached for relA by using a tagged protein and performing the same analysis ( Fig .
3D ) : LPS treatment of wt 70Z % , /3 expressing Flag-relA resulted in a translocation of Flag-relA into the nucleus .
In contrast , Flag-relA expressed in 1.3E2 did not respond to LPS .
Multiple stimuli are unable to activate NF-KB in 1.3E2 .
Since , in addition to LPS , a large number of stimuli are able to activate NF- « B in 70 % /3 , we analyzed their effect on 1.3E2 cells .
As with LPS , we monitored IxBa degradation ( Fig .
4 ) , induction of nuclear NF-kB binding activity ( Fig .
5 ) and NF-KB transcriptional activation ( Fig .
6A ) .
Stimuli like PMA , IL-1 , double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) , and Taxol ( 26 ) were unable to induce IxBa degradation and induce NF-kB binding or transcriptional activities in 1.3E2 .

Several different stimuli do not induce IxBa degradation in 1.3E2 .
( A ) Western blot analysis of IxBa levels in wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 following exposure to 100 ng of PMA per ml , 20 ng of IL-1 per ml , 0.1 mg of poly ( I-C ) per ml , or 50 M Taxol for the indicated times .

clone following treatment with PMA or IL-1 ( Fig .
2C , lanes 7 and 8 ) , whereas it was clearly detected in Zha ( Fig .
2C , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
In contrast , two phosphatase inhibitors , calyculin A and okadaic acid , as well as hyperosmotic shock with 0.4 M sorbitol ( 14 ) , were able to activate NF-KB in 1.3E2 , although the rate of IxBa degradation by sorbitol was somewhat lower than in 70Z/3 ( Fig .
4 and data not shown ) .
Interestingly , the use of calyculin A allowed us to also show that in the mutant cell line , the degradation step per se was fully functional .
Indeed , the proteasome inhibitor aLLnL blocked IxBa degradation induced by this reagent in both wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 ( data not shown ) .
As indicated above , IxBa degradation triggered by LPS , PMA , or IL-1 requires inducible phosphorylation on Ser 32/36 , a step that is sensitive to the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) .
We therefore tested the Ser 32/36 requirement and the sensitivity to PDTC of the stimuli that were still able to activate NF-kB in 1.3E2 .
Using a 70Z/3 cell line stably expressing a human IxBa doubly mutated on Ser 32 and 36 , we observed that in addition to LPS , PMA , IL-1 , and Taxol , calyculin A was unable to induce degradation of the mutant IxBa 70273 | 1.3E2 _ SO/relA ( MA .

Defective activation of NF- « B in 1.3E2 .

molecule ( Fig .
7A ) .
In the case of dsRNA , no unambiguous involvement of Ser 32/36 was demonstrated , due to the weakness of the response to this stimulus ( Fig .
4 ) .
Concerning hyperosmotic shock , we have recently shown that sorbitol does not induce IxBa degradation through Ser 32/36 in 70Z/3 ( 14 ) .
Treatment of 70Z/3 cells with the antioxidant PDTC could inhibit IxBa degradation induced by all the stimuli tested except for calyculin A ( Fig .
7B ) and hyperosmotic shock ( 14 ) .
Therefore , while calyculin A requires Ser 32/36 for degrada-tion , both calyculin A and osmotic shock are insensitive to the presence of PDTC .
This indicates that the stimuli that are able to activate NF-kB in 1.3E2 do not use the redox-sensitive IxBa degradation pathway .
The viral transactivator Tax can activate NF-KB in 1.3E2 .
The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -derived Tax protein has been shown to activate NF- « B in various cells ( 5 , 27 , 41 ) , but the way it operates remains unclear .
Although some authors have reported that Tax acts by inducing IxBa degradation through Ser 32 and 36 phosphorylation ( 23 , 28 , 53 ) , we have proposed that it could also work independently of IxBa , most probably by releasing NF-kB subunits retained in the cytoplasm by the p105 precursor of p50 ( 36 ) .
In support of this idea , it has recently been reported that Tax was able to increase the processing of p105 by interacting both with this precursor and with two different subunits of the proteasome , HsN3 and HC9 ( 40 ) .
In 70Z/3 cells , cotransfection of a NF- « B reporter plasmid with a Tax expression vector resulted in a five- to eightfold increase in luciferase production ( Fig .
6B ) .
A similar level of induction was also observed in 1.3E2 , suggesting that Tax does not use the pathway that is deficient in this cell line .
IBB and IxBe are also resistant to degradation in 1.3E2 .
The recent cloning of two new IxB molecules , IxBB and IxBg ( 55 , 61 ) , prompted us to analyze their fate in wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 .
In contrast to the results obtained by Thompson et al .
( 55 ) , we were able to show that IxBB could be degraded not only in response to LPS but also in response to PMA , IL-1 , Taxol , and calyculin A in 70Z/3 ( Fig .
8A and data not shown ) .
We have confirmed that this corresponds to a bona fide difference between two 70Z/3 clones .
When we analyzed 1.3E2 , we found that all these stimuli were unable to induce IxBB degradation .
Thus , the only difference that we noticed between the fates of IxBB and IxBa in 1.3E2 was in response to calyculin A .
Nevertheless , when we tested the effect of PDTC on IxBB degradation induced by this stimulus , we observed an inhibitory effect that had not been noticed with IxBa ( Fig .
7B and data not shown ) .
PDTC was also inhibitory for IxBB degradation induced by LPS , PMA , and Taxol in wt 70Z/3 ( data not shown ) .
Concerning IxBg , a more limited analysis was carried out but revealed important information .
Since endogenous IxBg was difficult to detect in 70Z/3 , we prepared stable wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cell lines expressing a myc-tagged IxBg .
As shown in Fig .
8B , whereas LPS was able to induce degradation of tagged IxBg , no such degradation was seen in 1.3E2 .
A similar result was obtained with PMA ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , in addition to that of IxBa , the degradation of IxBB and IxBe is deficient in 1.3E2 .
1.3E2 does not appear to be a mutant with a redox defect .
Since all the stimuli that do not activate NF-kB in 1.3E2 use a redox-regulated pathway , we wondered whether the oxidative state of 1.3E2 , before or after stimulation , could be perturbed .
A FACS protocol , which measures the level of cytoplasmic ROIs with the DCFH dye , was used .
Surprisingly , under standard culture conditions ( 10 % FCS-RPMI ) , 70 % , /3 cells exhibited a high ROI level ( Fig .
9A ) and this level was only weakly Vor .

( A ) Defective NF-kB transcriptional activity in 1.3E2 .
wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 were transiently transfected with an Igx-Luc reporter plasmid and stimulated 24 h later with 15 jg of LPS per ml ( L ) , 100 ng of PMA per ml ( P ) , 20 ng of IL-1 per ml ( I ) , or 0.1 mg of poly ( I-C ) per ml ( R ) for 6 h. Cellular extracts were prepared , and the luciferase activity was compared to that of nonstimulated cells ( C ) .
A representative experiment is shown .
For each stimulus at least four experiments , in duplicate , were carried out .
( B ) The HTLV-1-derived Tax frans-activator activates NF- « B in 1.3E2 .
wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 were transiently transfected with an Igx-Luc reporter plasmid , together with either an empty expression vector ( C ) or a vector expressing Tax ( T ) ( 36 ) .
The luciferase activity of cellular extracts was determined 24 h later .
A representative experiment is shown .
Three other experiments were carried out in duplicate and gave similar results .
modified by H , O , whereas it remained unaffected by PMA ( Fig .
9B ) .
A similar observation was made with 1.3E2 cells , excluding the possibility that the basal redox state of the mutant cell was perturbed .
To analyze a putative production of ROIs during the stimulation process , we tried to grow 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells in 2 % FCS-RPML .
This treatment resulted in a large drop in the internal ROI level in both cell lines ( Fig .
9B , compare bars 1 and 6 to bars 3 and 8 ) .
Importantly , this ROI level could not be substantially modified by PMA or IL-1 ( lanes 4 and 9 and data not shown ) whereas it could be strongly increased by 500 uM H , O , ( lanes 5 and 10 ) .
In this case , a level similar to that observed with cells grown at high serum concentrations was obtained .
Such an observation allowed us to investigate whether an oxidative stress was able by itself to activate NF-kB in 70Z/3 or to correct the defect of 1.3E2 , by preincubating the cells with H , O , before adding LPS .
In neither case were we able to detect any induced NF-kB binding activity , as judged by EMSA , or induced transcriptional activity , as judged by a luciferase assay ( data not shown ) .
These studies , therefore , did not reveal any redox perturbation in 1.3E2 .
They also indicated that a redox stress was unable by itself to induce NF-KB .
Several other signaling cascades are active in 1.3E2 .
Under standard growth conditions , the growth rate of 1.3E2 is slightly higher than that of wt 70Z/3 ( data not shown ) .
This indicates that the basal metabolism of this cell line is not perturbed .
To confirm this view , we analyzed various transduction cascades involving kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family ( for reviews , see references 12 , 25 , and 58 ) .
Two distinct sets of experiments were carried out .
In the first set , the signal-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 and p38 was ana-lyzed .
In 70Z/3 , ERK2 and p38 can be phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to PMA and sorbitol , respectively ( 20 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts were therefore prepared from stimulated wt 70Z , /3 and 1.3E2 cells , run on a denaturing gel and analyzed by Western blotting with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 .
As shown in Fig .
10 , ERK2 and p38 were phosphorylated on tyrosine to the same extent in wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 .
The second set of experiments used transfection of wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells with reporter plasmids carrying multicopies of the tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( TPA ) -responsive element ( TRE ) or serum responsive element ( SRE ) .
AP-1 , the transcription factor that recognizes TRE , has been shown to respond to JNK activation ( 12 , 25 , 58 ) whereas TCF and SRF , the SRE-binding proteins , can be targets of ERK , p38 , or JNK , depending on the stimulus tested .
Despite repeated attempts , we were unable to observe any substantial activation of the TRE-Luc plasmid by PMA in wt precluding a comparison with 1.3E2 .
In contrast , an SRE-Lue plasmid was responsive to PMA or sorbitol to similar extents in wt 70Z % /3 and 1.3E2 cells ( Fig .
10 ) .
These results indicated that at least two different MAPK pathways were fully functional in 1.3E2 .
DISCUSSION A hallmark of NF- « B is its remarkable capacity to respond to a wide range of stimuli .
Only recently has it been shown that all these stimuli act by inactivating IxB molecules .

The stimuli that do not activate NF- « B in 1.3E2 act on Ser 32/36 of IxBa and use a PDTC-sensitive pathway .
( A ) Role of Ser 32/36 in the degradation process .
70Z , /3 cells expressing a doubly mutated ( Ser 32/36 - > Ala 32/36 ) hIxBa molecule were mock stimulated ( lanes C ) or treated with 15 ug of LPS per ml ( lane L ) , 50 M Taxol ( lane T ) , 20 ng of IL-1 per ml ( lane I ) , or 300 nM calyculin A ( lane Cal . )
for 1 h. Degradation of hIxBa was monitored by Western blotting .
The relative migrations of exogenous hIxBa and endogenous mIxBa are indicated on the right .

Degradation of IxBB and I « Be is defective in 1.3E2 .
( A ) Western blot analysis of IBB levels in wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 following exposure to 15 ug of LPS per ml , 100 ng of PMA per ml , 50 M Taxol , or 300 nM calyculin A for the indicated times .
( B ) Western blot analysis of myc-hIxBge levels in wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 .
wt 70Z/3 ( lane Z ) , 1.3E2 ( lane E ) , and cells stably expressing myc-hI « Be ( lanes Ze and Eg ) were pre-incubated for 45 min with 10 jg of cycloheximide per ml and then stimulated for 90 min with 15 pg of LPS per ml .
Cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-€ antibody ( no .
812 ) and analyzed with an anti-myc antibody .
Ig , heavy chain of immunoglobulin G. of IxBa , for most stimuli , inactivation proceeds according to the following sequence .
First , a phosphorylation event takes place on Ser 32/36 , and then the molecule is ubiquitinated on Lys 21/22 and subsequently degraded by the 268 proteasome .
It is still not known whether Ser 32/36 phosphorylation results from the activation of a kinase or from the inactivation of a phosphatase .
It also remains to be determined whether one or several distinct kinases ( or phosphatases ) participate in the IxBa phosphorylation process .
In this study , we have shown that the mutant cell line 1.3E2 does not degrade IxBa in response to LPS , Taxol , PMA , IL-1 , or dsRNA .
More specifically , we have demonstrated an absence of phosphorylation on Ser 32/36 after stimulation with these agents .
Since neither IxBa , p50 , nor relA appears to be mutated , the 1.3E2 cell line represents a transduction mutant that is defective in a step shared by at least five different stimuli .
If a single kinase is responsible for Ser 32/36-induced phosphorylation , such a kinase could be mutated in 1.3E2 .
Alternatively , in the case of the inactivation of a phosphatase , the inactivation step could be defective .
Finally , a more upstream component could be mutated but it would have to be 1200 7 702/73 1.3E2 1000 1 800 1 600 4007 2001 o M me o 5 10 a 5 Emission at 525nm ( Relative Units ) 1G ( mn ) common to all the signal transduction pathways which are inactive in inducing degradation of IxBa in 1.3EZ .
The little we know about the signaling pathways that are activated in response to LPS , Taxol , PMA , IL-1 , or dsRNA does not provide any obvious common intermediate .
Nevertheless , activation of NF- « B by the five stimuli listed above is inhibited by preincubating the cells with the antioxidant PDTC , indicating the requirement of a redox-regulated step .
Two models have been proposed to explain the effect of antioxidants on NF- « B activation .
In the first , the stimuli that activate NF-kB are able to generate ROIs , and these ROIs , acting as second messengers , modulate the phosphorylation of IxBa ( 47-49 ) .
Antioxidants are believed to act by neutralizing such intermediates .
If this model is correct , a possibility would be that LPS , PMA , IL-1 , etc. , act on the same molecule to generate an ROI and that this molecule is inactive in 1.3E2 .
In this case , it should be possible to recover NF-kB activation in 1.3E2 by artificially raising the ROI level .
Unfortunately , despite our repeated attempts , such recovery was not observed by treating cells with H , O , In the second model proposed to explain the effect of anti B 2000 7 2 5 7023 1.322 0 .2 3 0 & E 10007 to ) & c 0 E E tJ O— 1 20 30 4 S5 60 7 8 9 19 FIG .

MAPK activation pathways are functional in 1.3E2 .

( B ) Transcriptional activation of the reporter construct SRE-Luc .
SRE-Luc was transiently transfected into wt 70Z/3 or 1.3E2 and then mock stimulated ( bars C ) or stimulated with 100 ng of PMA per ml ( bars P ) or 0.4 M sorbitol ( bars S ) .
The experiment was repeated twice , with similar results .
oxidants on NF-kB activation , some undefined step in the transduction pathway that leads to IxBa degradation is thought to depend on the redox state of the cytoplasm ( 2 ) .
In this case , antioxidants would act by globally modifying the redox state of the cell .
As presented above , we have not been able to detect any significant difference between the redox states of wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 .
We have observed that under standard growth conditions , both wt 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 exhibit the same high ROI level .
All these observations , therefore , do not favor the view that 1.3E2 is a redox-deficient mutant .
Another important feature of 1.3E2 is the absence of IxBB and IxBg degradation in response to stimuli like LPS , PMA , IL-1 , or Taxol .
This suggests some common requirement for the degradation of the three major NF-KB inhibitors .
Although numerous questions remain as to how the IxBB and IxBe inhibitors are inactivated , four facts are worth noting .
First , degradation of the three inhibitors , in response to the stimuli listed above , is PDTC sensitive .
Second , in each case , proteolysis is carried out by the proteasome complex .
Third , IxBB and IxBg exhibit a two-serine motif ( Ser 19 and 23 for B ; Ser 157 and 161 for £ ) very similar to the one containing Ser 32 and 36 in IxBa .
Mutagenesis of both serines in this motif inhibits IxBB and IxBg degradation in response to LPS ( 16 , 59a , 61 ) .
Fourth , in our cell system , IxBa , IxBB , and IxBg appear to respond to the same set of stimuli ( Results and data not shown ) , although some quantitative differences can be noted .
All these observations point to a similar mode of degradation for the three inhibitors .
Since we already know , from the IxBa analysis , that proteolysis by the proteasome is not defective in 1.3E2 but induced phosphorylation is abolished , a similar NF-kB ACTIVATION-DEFICIENT CELL LINE - 1447 problem may affect IxBB and IxBg .
In this case , IxBB and could be the targets of the same kinase ( s ) [ or phosphatase ( s ) ] as IxBao .
Alternatively , different kinases ( or phosphatases ) could be recruited but their activation would be under the same control .
In any case , 1.3E2 analysis reveals an unexpected functional coupling between IxBa , IxBB , and IxBg inactivation .
Three kinds of stimuli , the osmotic shock , the phosphatase inhibitors , and the viral transactivator Tax , are still able to activate NF-kB in 1.3EZ .
We have shown that degradation of IxBa in response to osmotic shock does not require Ser 32 and 36 ( 14 ) , suggesting an alternative mode of NF-kB activation that is still functional in 1.3E2 .
In the case of calyculin A and okadaic acid , the two phosphatase inhibitors we have used , our results were more surprising .
We have indeed shown that IxBa degradation by both inhibitors requires Ser 32 and 36 and is proteasome dependent but is not sensitive to PDTC .
How can we reconcile this observation with the data reported above ?
It could indicate that the phosphatase inhibitors are able to indirectly activate the kinase ( s ) or to directly inhibit the phos-phatase ( s ) involved in IxBa degradation without using the PDTC-sensitive step .
Consequently , the defect in 1.3E2 would be located before the Ser 32/36 phosphorylation step .
Alternatively , and this is the hypothesis we favor , the action of the phosphatase inhibitors does not reflect the physiological mode of NF- « B activation .
Indeed , incubation of 70Z/3 with calyculin A or okadaic acid results in a broad hyperphosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins ( see the aberrant migration of p50/relA and p50/pS50 dimers in Fig .
5 ) , among them IxBa ( data not shown ) , and such a hyperphosphorylation could inadvertently occur on Ser 32 and 36 , triggering the degradation of IxBa .
In this case , the translocation of p50/relA in 1.3E2 would only confirm the existence of potentially functional IxB/ NF- « B complexes in the cytoplasm of the mutant cell line but would not bring any valuable information regarding the normal NF- « B activation process .
Interestingly , however , calyculin A induces IxBB degradation in wt 70Z , /3 but not in 1.3E2 , and PDTC blocks this degradation .
This demonstrates that the PDTC-insensitive pathway that is observed with IxBa is not active on IxBB and suggests that calyculin A can act at several levels in 70Z/3 .
We have no obvious explanation for the observation that the viral transactivator Tax is fully active in 1.3E2 .
If , like LPS or PMA , it acts via IxBa phosphorylation , this would mean that the phosphorylation step is still functional in 1.3E2 and , consequently , would locate the defect at a step upstream .
Alternatively , the NF- « B activation that we observed with Tax could result from an alternative pathway , such as a change in p105 processing ( 36 , 40 ) .
Unfortunately , 70Z/3 cells are difficult to transfect and the transdominant effect of an IxBa doubly mutated on Ser 32/36 on NF-xB activation by Tax has not yet been possible to evaluate .
A summary of our observations is depicted in Fig .
11 .
We propose that in the 1.3E2 cell line , a component shared by several distinct stimuli to induce the degradation of IxBa , IxBB , and IxBg is mutated .
This component itself or the pathway in which it participates is sensitive to antioxidants .
In contrast , other pathways that do not use this step are fully functional .
In conclusion , we believe that complementation of the 1.3E2 cell line will allow the characterization of an intermediate that plays a crucial role in NF-kB activation .
More importantly , since 1.3E2 is fully viable , despite a perturbed NF- « B activation process , such an intermediate may represent a putative target for immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drugs .
Finally , 1.3E2 should help to identify new targets of NF-kB by 1448 COURTOIS ET AL .

Proposed location of the defect in 1.3E2 .
The various data reported in this study , together with some not shown , have been assembled to give a simplified overview .
The dotted arrow indicates the pathway that is defective in 1.3E2 .
The dual effect of calyculin A is explained in the text .
Moreover , to simplify the figure , dsRNA is shown to act on IxBB and IxBg , but this point remains obscure , since this stimulus is a weak activator of NF-kB .
Finally , since IxBe does not appear to interact with p50-containing NF- « B molecules ( 61 ) , a tentative association with molecules like c-rel/reIA has been represented .
