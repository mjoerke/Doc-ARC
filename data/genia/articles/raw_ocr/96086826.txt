Apparently normal at birth , IxBa~ ' '' ~ mice exhibit severe runting , skin defects , and extensive granulopoiesis postnatally , typically dying by 8 days .
Hematopoietic tissues from these mice display elevated levels of both nuclear NF- « B and mRNAs of some , but not all , genes thought to be regulated by NF- « B .
NF-KB elevation results in these phenotypic abnormalities because mice lacking both IxBa « and the p50 subunit of NF- « xB show a dramatically delayed onset of abnormalities .
In contrast to hematopoietic cells , -/- embryonic fibroblasts show minimal constitutive NF-KB , as well as normal signal-dependent NF- « B activation that is concomitant with IxBB degradation .
Our results indicate that IBB , but not IxBa , is required for the signal-dependent activation of NF- « xB in fibroblasts .
However , IxBa is required for the postinduction repression of in fibroblasts .
These results define distinct roles for the two forms of IxB and demonstrate the necessity for stringent control of NF-KB .

Members of the NF- « B transcription factor family have been identified in various organisms , ranging from flies to mammals ( for review , see Nolan and Baltimore 1992 ; Liou and Baltimore 1993 ; Baeuerle and Henkel 1994 ) .
In mammals , the most widely distributed kB-binding activity is a heterodimer { called NF- « B ) of a 50-kD ( p50 ) and a 65-kD ( p65 or RelA } protein [ Baeuerle and Baltimore 1989 ) .
Members of this family , which also include the proto-oncogene c-Rel , RelB , and p100/p52 , share a highly conserved amino-terminal sequence called the Rel-homology region ( RHR ) { Nolan and Baltimore 1992 ; Liou and Baltimore 1993 ; Baeuerle and Henkel 1994 ) .
This region is required for dimerization as well as DNA binding and its structure is known in detail for p50 homodimers ( Ghosh et al .
1995 ; Muller et al .
1995 ) .
NF- « B complexes are localized typically to the cytoplasm bound to inhibitory cytoplasmic retention proteins called the IxBs .
NF-kB can be activated by a wide variety of signals including cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor- « { TNFa ) and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , bacterial products , such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , oxidative stress , viruses , and DNA-damaging agents ( for review , see Grilli et al .
1993 ; Baeuerle and Henkel 1994 ) .

the nucleus where it can regulate transcriptionally various target genes .
NF- « B responsive genes include those for various cytokines , adhesion molecules , cell surface receptors , and immune modulators ( Grilli et al .
1993 ; Bacuerle and Henkel 1994 ) .
The recent generation of p105/p50 and RelA-deficient mice have revealed defects in immune responses and the inability to induce cyto-kine-dependent gene expression ( Beg et al .
1995 ; Sha et al .
1995 ) .
In addition , studies carried out on RelA-deficient mice have demonstrated the importance of that protein for hepatocyte survival , whereas studies on RelB-deficient mice have revealed defects in the formation of thymic dendritic cells ( Beg et al .
1995 ; Burkly et al .
1995 ; Weih et al .
1995 ) .
These studies underscore the critical role played by members of the NF-KB family in various developmental and functional processes .
The IkB proteins comprise a distinct family that is also highly conserved in disparate species ( for review , see Haskill et al .
1991 ; Inoue et al .
1992 ; Beg and Baldwin 1993 ; Thompson et al .
1995 ) .
The region of homology is limited to the ankyrin repeats that have been shown to be required for interaction with the RHR of NF- « B proteins ( Beg and Baldwin 1993 ) .
Although , several proteins with IxB-like activity have been identified , the IxkBa ( Haskill et al .
1991 ) and IxBB ( Thompson et al .
1995 ) proteins are the best studied .
In addition , the carboxy-terminal regions of the p105 and p100 precursors of the p50 and p52 subunits of NF-KB also contain ankyrin re 2736 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 9:2736-2746 © 1995 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/95 $ 5.00 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press peats and thus , can function as IxB proteins through an intramolecular interaction mechanism ( Henkel et al .
1992 ; Rice et al .
1992 ; Mercurio et al .
1993 ; Scheinman et al .
1993 ) .
Recent studies have shown that stimulation of cells with NF- « B inducers , such as TNFa and IL-1 , can lead to the rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa , allowing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus ( Beg et al .
1993 ; Brown et al .
1993 ; Sun et al .
1993 ) .
Site-specific phosphorylation of IxBa ( Brockman et al .
1995 ; Brown et al .
1995 ; Chen et al .
1995 ) does not cause dissociation from NF- « B but apparently renders it susceptible to degradation ( Finco et al .
1994 ; Israel 1995 ) .
The I « kBB protein is proposed to be targeted by a subset of NF- « B inducers and may be responsible for persistent activation of NF-KB in response to these stimuli ( Thompson et al .
1995 ) .
Despite recent advances in understanding the regulation of NF- « B and IxB proteins , major issues remain un-resolved .
How can so many seemingly diverse stimuli lead to NF- « B activation ?
How do NF-kB proteins specifically regulate subsets of target genes in response to particular stimuli ?
How are the optimal levels of NF-kB maintained in the cytoplasm and nucleus , both before and after stimulation ?
Is degradation of IxB proteins sufficient to allow nuclear translocation of NF-kB ?
Do different IxB forms perform distinct functions ?
The key to deciphering these issues is understanding the function and regulation of the IxB proteins .
Here we describe the generation of IxBo-deficient mice by gene targeting .
IxBa~ '' ~ mice show significantly elevated nuclear NF- « B levels in thymocytes and splenocytes but only slightly elevated levels in brain and fibroblasts .
NF- « B activation leads to up-regulation of certain target genes , including granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) .
The appearance of phenotypic abnormalities in the IxBo~ '' ~ mice , which include elevated granulopoiesis and severe runting , are significantly delayed in the absence of p50 .
These results suggest strongly that constitutive nuclear NF- « B is the cause of abnormalities in IxBa~ '' ~ mice .
IxBa is not necessary for the signal-dependent activation of NF- « B in embryonic fibroblasts but is required for the down-regulation of nuclear NF-KB after stimulation .
Our results indicate that persistent NF-kB elevation can be lethal , and that IxBa plays the major role in hematopoietic cells by keeping NF- « B latent in the cytoplasm .
IxBa also plays the more general role of rapidly repressing NF- « B once an inducing stimulus is terminated , assuring that NF-kB will only be present in the nucleus for a limited time .
Results Generation of IkBa~ '' ~ mice The murine IkBa gene was rendered dysfunctional in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells by homologous recombination with the gene-targeting vector pPNT-IxBaKO ( Fig .
1A ) .
The gene was replaced with the bacterial lacZ gene such that lacZ expression would be regulated by the IxBa pro moter , although that capability is not studied here .
ES Generation of IxBa-deficient mice cell lines with a disrupted IxBa allele were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric animals .
Male mice from a clone that gave > 70 % chimerism transmitted the recombinant allele to their progeny .
Heterozygous animals were indistinguishable from wild-type animals , and subsequently , were interbred to obtain homozygotes .
A Southern blot analysis of the different genotypic categories is shown in Figure 1B .
General phenotype IxBa~ '' '~ mice were indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous mice at birth , In addition , they were present in expected Mendelian ratios suggesting no in utero lethality .
Three to 4 days after birth , 25 % of the pups appeared smaller than their littermates .
By 7 days these pups were severely runted , typically being one-third normal weight , and died shortly thereafter .
Geno-typing of the runted and dead pups showed that they were IxBa~'~ .
The newborn IkB « ~'~ mice had normally formed internal organs .
Thymocytes and splenocyte extracts obtained from these animals were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-l « Ba serum .
Heterozygous animals showed a reduction of IxBa « , whereas homozygous animals showed the absence of IkBa ( Fig .
1C ) .
As early as 2 days after birth , the spleens of IkBa_~'~ mice appeared smaller than those of wild-type animals with a further reduction in spleen size until the time of death .
Thymic atrophy , a well-documented response to stress , was also pronounced in IxB « a~'~ animals older than 6 days .
At this stage , both the spleen and liver also appeared somewhat anemic .
Histologic analysis revealed no significant differences in internal organs between newborn IxBa~'~ and control littermates .
However , analysis of IxB « ~'~ pups older than 2 or 3 days revealed various abnormalities that became progressively more pronounced .
Bone marrow and spleen sections displayed significantly elevated numbers of granulocytic precursors ( Fig .
2A , B ) .
Peripheral blood had a threefold rise in white blood cells ( 95 % of which were neutrophils ) and a significant reduction in the number of reticulocytes .
However , red cell counts and hematocrits were not reduced in IxBa~ '' ~ mice .
The skin of the IxBa~ '' ~ mice appeared scaly with significant sloughing and a poorly defined basal cell layer [ Fig .
2C , D ) .
Elevated numbers of granulocytes were present in skin sections and may contribute to the skin abnormalities ( see Discussion } .
All other organs and tissues in the these animals were histologically unremarkable .
To analyze in more detail the myeloid and lymphoid lineages in the IxBa~ '' ~ animals , we carried out flow cytometric analysis on thymocyte and splenocyte populations [ data not shown ) .
At 3 days , a normal distribution of CD4/CD8 double-negative , double-positive , and sin-gle-positive cells was observed .
Thy-1 and T-cell receptor [ TCR ) expression on thymocytes was also normal .
However , a reduction in the proportion of double-posi-tive cells was found in mice that were > 6 days , a likely consequence of depletion of the thymic cortex .

Staining of splenocytes with the granulocyte-spe-cific Gr-1 marker or the macrophage-specific Mac-1 marker showed that populations of both cell types were elevated , consistent with previous histological analysis .
These results also suggest that the decrease in spleen size is caused by depletion of erythroid and/or lymphoid lineages but not of myeloid lineages .
In any case , our results indicate that major hematopoietic lineages can form in the absence of IxBa .

slightly elevated constitutive NF- « B levels .
These results demonstrate that the loss of I « xBa causes constitutive NF-kB to be present in the nuclei of many cells types with a predominant effect in hematopoietic cells .
The difference between constitutive NF- « B levels in hematopoietic cells compared to others suggested that IxBa may play a variably important role in repressing NF-kB present in different cell types .
To examine this issue , we determined the levels of IxBa in wild-type thymocyte and embryonic fibroblast cytoplasmic extracts .
The same amount of extracted protein contained significantly lower levels of IkxBa in embryonic fibroblasts than in thymocytes ( Fig .
3D , lanes 1,2 ) .
In contrast , similar levels of IxBB were present in both thymocyte and embryonic fibroblast cytoplasmic extracts ( Fig .
3D , lanes 3,4 ) .
These results suggest that the contribution of IxBa « to the regulation of NF-KB is cell-type dependent , IxBa being quantitatively more significant for the regulation of NF-kB in hematopoietic cells compared to nonhematopoietic cells .
Up-regulation of NF- « B responsive genes in IxBa « a_~'~- mice A wide variety of genes have been proposed to be regulated by members of the NF-kB transcription factor family ( for review , see Grilli et al .
1993 ; Baeuerle and Henkel 1994 ) .
Elevated NF- « B levels in cells from IxBa~'~ animals suggested that NF- « B-responsive genes might also be up-regulated .
We were interested particularly in genes that may cause phenotypic abnormalities in the IxBa~'~ mice .
Among the various genes that have been proposed to be regulated by NF-kB is that for G-CSF ( Tsuchiya et al .
1986 ; Nishizawa and Nagata 1990 ) , a key cytokine that stimulates the production of granulocytes .
To determine mRNA levels of G-CSF , we used RNA isolated from thymocytes because they display high levels of nuclear NF- « B .
Reverse transcriptase , polymerase chain reaction [ ( RT-PCR ) analysis showed significantly elevated levels of G-CSF mRNA in thymocytes from IxBa~'~ animals ( Fig .
4 ) .

- Analysis of mRNA levels of NF-kB responsive genes .
RNA was isolated from 3-day-old { lanes 1-4 } or 6-day-old { lanes 5-8 ) mice of different genotypes as indicated above the lanes .
The RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for various genes , as indicated at left .
2740 GENES & DEVELOPMENT was seen in thymocytes from 3- or 6-day-old mice .
Thus , elevated production of this cytokine may be responsible for the extensive granulopoiesis seen in the I « Ba~ '' ~ animals .
The mRNA levels of other genes involved in the recruitment or adherence of granulocytes were examined using the PCR to amplify regions of the transcripts .
The mRNA levels for the chemo-attractant murine macrophage inflammatory protein 2 ( MIP-2 ) [ Tekamp-Olson et al .
1990 ) ( a mouse IL-8 homolog ) and the adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) { Araki et al .
1993 ) were clearly elevated [ Fig .
4 ) .
Genes for both of these proteins contain NF- « B sites in their promoter regions and have been postulated to be regulated by NF- « B ( Lademarco et al .
1992 ; Widmer et al .
1993 ) .
In contrast , the mRNAs of other genes thought to be regulated by NF-kB , including GM-CSF , IL-2 , IL-2Ra , IL-6 , and c-myc ( Baeuerle and Henkel 1994 } , were not detect-ably elevated in cells from IkxBa~ '' ~ animals ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the presence of nuclear NF- « B is sufficient to up-regulate some but not all NF-kB responsive genes , underscoring the importance of other transcription factors in activating many NF- « B target genes .
Absence of p50 leads to prolonged survival of IxBa-~ '' =- mice To examine the role of constitutive NF-kB in the neonatal lethality displayed by IxBa~'~ mice , we initiated crosses with p50 ~'~ mice to generate mice lacking both IxBa and the p50 subunit of NF- « B .
Although p50~'~ mice exhibit multifocal defects in immune responses , they develop normally ( Sha et al .
1995 ) , allowing us to assess the effects of the absence of p50 on the IxBa « phenotype .
In initial crosses between p50 *'~IkBa *'~ mice , 68 offspring were genotyped at weaning , at least 2 weeks after all IxBa~ '' ~ mice with p50 had died .
Interestingly , 5 of the 68 offspring ( 7.4 % ) were phenotypically unusual , and were the only 5 offspring genotyped as p50~'~IxBa~ '' ~ .
This result corresponds to the expected percentage of p50~'~IxBa~ '' ~ mice ( 1 of 13 ) if the absence of p50 was significantly prolonging the survival of IxBe~'~ mice .
Subsequent breeding experiments indicated that p50 ~'-IkBa~'~ mice typically survived 2 to 4 weeks , with the majority dying shortly after weaning at 3 weeks .
At the time of death , p50~'~IxBa « a~ '' ~ mice ( Fig .
5A ) exhibited many of the phenotypes that characterize the neonatal lethality of IxB « a~ '' ~ mice .
In addition to severe runting , bone marrow from p50~'~IkBa~ '' ~ mice displayed significantly elevated numbers of granulocyte precursors .
Pro-nounced , but variable , sloughing and scaling of skin and fur was evident , with tail skin demonstrating marked hyperkeratinization [ Fig .
5A¥a ) .
Spleen and thymus were also atrophied .
These abnormalities were not evident in younger animals and became progressively more pronounced as p50 ~'~IxBae~ '' ~ mice aged .
Between days 6 and 8 ( Fig .
5B ) , when IkxB « ~'~ mice typically died , p50~'~IxBa « a~ '' ~ mice were virtually indistinguishable from control littermates .

taken from p50~'~IkBa « ~ '' ~ mice during this early time period appeared histologically normal .
These results indicate that absence of the p50 subunit of NF- « xB appears to suppress , but not completely eliminate , the onset of the IkxBa~'~ phenotype .
Absence of p50 significantly reduces constitutive NF- « B activity The markedly increased survival of p50~'~IkB « e~'~ mice suggested that constitutive activation of NF-kB could be the primary cause of the neonatal lethal pheno-type , and that absence of p50-containing complexes lead to a reduction in constitutive NF- « B activity .
To test this hypothesis , we determined the nuclear levels of NF-kB in cells from IxBa*'* , IkBa*'~ , or IxBa~ '' ~ littermates lacking p50 .
In contrast to the results observed with p50+*'+*IxB « e~ '' ~ mice { see Fig .
3A ) , only a minor increase in nuclear NF-kB from extracts prepared from 3-day-old thymocytes was seen in p50 ~'~IkBa ~~ mice ( Fig .
6A ) .
Again , equivalent binding activity was observed with a control octamer-specific probe ( Fig .
6B ) .
The nuclear NF-kB complexes from p50~'~IkBa « _~'~ Generation of IxBo-deficient mice mice were reactive primarily to anti-p52 and anti-RelB , but not to anti-RelA sera ( data not shown ) .
The lack of reactivity to anti-RelA sera may be because RelA is associated predominantly with p50 and thus , in the absence of p50 , RelA DNA binding is also not detected .
In any case , our results demonstrate that constitutive nuclear « B-binding activity is greatly reduced in p50 ~'~IxBae~ '' ~ mice and implicate constitutive NF- « B as the primary cause of neonatal lethality in IkBo ~'~ mice .
Signal-dependent NF- « B activation in IxBa « a_'~ fibroblasts Several studies have identified IxBa « as a key target molecule that is phosphorylated and degraded rapidly after stimulation of cells with NF-kB inducers { for review , see Beg and Baldwin 1993 ) .
Free NF-kB translocates to the nucleus after IxBo loss and regulates various target genes .
Furthermore , IxBB has been described as not being degraded after exposure to certain inducers ( Thompson et al .
1995 ) .
To determine whether NF- « B could be activated in the absence of IxBa , embryonic fibroblasts were treated with TNFa for different periods .
A Western blot analysis showed that IxBa was degraded after TNFa stimulation in wild-type embryonic fibroblasts , consistent with previous studies on other cell types ( data not shown ) .
However , NF-kB was activated by TNFa in IxBa~ '' ~ embryonic fibroblasts to levels similar to wild-type embryonic fibroblasts ( Fig .
7A ) .
Thus , degradation of IxBa after TNFa treatment can not be solely responsible for NF- « B activation in embryonic fibroblasts .
Stimulation of embryonic fibroblasts with phorbol , 12-myristate , l3-acetate ( PMA ) or LPS also showed NF- « B activation ( Fig .
7B , C ) .

A Western blot analysis of IxB « a~'~ embryonic fibroblast extracts with anti-p105 sera showed no significant change in p105 levels after treatment of embryonic fibroblasts with TNFa ( Fig .

Moreover , identical levels of IxBB were detected in wild-type and IxBa « a~ '' ~ embryonic fibroblasts , indicating that the absence of IxBa did not lead to altered regulation of IxBRB { data not shown ) .

IxBa is essential for the postinduction repression of NF-KB activity Sustained NF-kB activation typically requires the constant presence of a stimulus , with the removal of an inducing agent leading to the disappearance of nuclear NF- « B ( Hohmann et al .

To determine whether IxBa was required for the post-stimulation repression of NF- « B activity , embryonic fibroblasts were treated with TNFa for 30 min , after which cells were placed in medium without TNFa for various periods .

7E , lanes 1-5 ) .
However , IxBa~'~ cells maintained high levels of nuclear NF- « B for < 4 hours [ Fig .
76 , lanes 6-10 ) .
These results demonstrate that although IxBa is not necessary for activation of NF-kB in embryonic fibroblasts , it is necessary for postinduction repression , suggesting a general role for IxBa even in cell types where it is not a predominant species .
Discussion IxBa~'~ mice display elevated levels of nuclear NF- « B in various cell types .
Thus , the absence of IxBa is sufficient to cause nuclear translocation of NF-KB , and no other signal-dependent events than those leading to the degradation of IxBa are necessary for nuclear translocation of NF- « xB .
Nuclear NF-kB results in elevation of mRNA levels of only a subset of NF- « xB-regulated genes suggesting that up-regulation of levels may be sufficient to activate some but not all responsive genes .
Thus , the signal-dependent induction of mRNAs of genes that contain « B sites may also require the induction of other transcription factors .
However , the results presented here suggest that the genes for G-CSF , MIP-2 , and VCAM-1 can be activated transcriptionally in a non-signal dependent manner by simply increasing nuclear NF- « B levels .
A consequence of the up-regulation of mRNAs of these and other genes may be the extensive granulopoiesis and skin abnormalities seen in IxBa ~'~ mice .
Although thymocytes were used as a source for RNA in this study , other cell types such as macrophages or stro-mal cells could be more important for the production of these cytokines .
The wide range of tissues that show NF- « B elevation suggest that most , if not all , cell types will have some degree of NF- « B activation .
Interestingly , dramatically different levels of NF-KB activation occur in particular cell types from the IxBa~ '' ~ mice .
For example , thymocytes show an extensive dramatic elevation in nuclear NF-kB , whereas embryonic fibroblasts show only a slight increase .
In addition , we find that higher levels of IxBa « are normally present in thymocytes than in fibroblasts .
Thus , the differences in nuclear NF- « B levels in individual IxBa « _~ ' '' ~ cell types probably reflects the constitutive presence in the nucleus of the portion of NF-kB that is ordinarily associated with IxBa .
IxBa would then play a major role in the cytoplasmic retention of NF- « B in hematopoietic cells ( thymocytes and splenocytes ) , but a minor role in nonhematopoietic cells ( fibroblasts or brain ) .
Increased levels of IxBa in hematopoietic cells may be caused by up-regulation of transcription of the IxBa gene because of the higher constitutive levels of nuclear NF-KB in those cells ( Grilli et al .
1993 ; Scott et al .
1993 ; Sun et al .
1993 ; Baeuerle and Henkel 1994 ) .
In contrast , the levels of IxBB are roughly equivalent in various cells because it is not regulated by NF-kB ( Thompson et al .
1995 ) .
Phenotypic abnormalities in IxBa_-~ '' '~- mice IxBo~ '' ~ mice display extensive granulopoiesis and skin Generation of IxBa-deficient mice defects .
Skin sections of IxBa~ '' ~ mice revealed the pres ence of a poorly defined basal cell layer , a possible consequence of rapid differentiation of these cells .
However , it is presently unclear whether keratinocytes in IxBa _~'~ mice are themselves defective or exhibit abnormalities as a consequence of signals provided by other cells , perhaps those of lymphoid or myeloid lineages .
Interestingly , several skin diseases in humans , including psori-asis , have been associated with abnormalities in hematopoietic cells .
In this regard , mice may provide a useful tool for understanding the interplay between hematopoietic cells and keratinocytes .
The elevated neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood of IxBa~'~ animals are probably attributable to increased granulopoiesis in the bone marrow .
Elevated production of cytokines such as G-CSF in IxBa « a~'~ mice may lead to increased differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells along the granulocyte pathway .
No evidence of bacterial infections were found in the IxBa~ ' '' ~ mice , suggesting that elevated granulopoiesis is not secondary to infection .
Although the precise physiological defects that result in death of these animals remains unclear , the progressive runting suggests that constitutively elevated cytokines may be a precipitating cause .
Delayed onset of phenotypic abnormalities in p50~'-~IrBa_~'~- mice The increased survival of mice deficient for both p50 and IxBa over mice deficient in IxBa « alone , and the reduced levels of constitutive NF-kB activity in these mice , implicates constitutive nuclear NF- « B activity as the major cause of lethality in IxB « ~ '' '~ mice .
In contrast to other organismal systems , suppression of a mouse phenotype caused by mutation at one locus by elimination of a gene at another locus has rarely been shown previously .
Crosses between mouse models with null mutations in related genes , such as the sre protein tyrosine kinase ( Lowell et al , 1994 ) or insulin-like growth factor family [ Liu et al .
1993 ) , typically have led to an augmented phe-notype , a consequence of the elimination of compensation or redundancy of gene function by other family members .
In a few instances , suppression of a mammalian phenotype has been reported , such as the reduction in lymphoproliferation in lpr mice lacking class I MHC ( Maldonado et al .
1995 ) .
Interestingly , genetic background has been shown recently to dramatically affect the mutant phenotype of mice deficient in the keratin 8 gene ( Baribault et al .
1994 ) and mice deficient in the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor ( Sibilia and Wagner 1995 ; Threadgill et al 1995 ) , presumably because of the effect of unidentified background genes .
Given the incomplete suppression of the IxBa~ '' ~ phenotype by a null p50 allele , it is likely that the appearance of phenotypic abnormalities in the IxB « ~'~ mice can be mediated by other NF- « B subunits .
Further combinatorial analysis of mice deficient in multiple NF- « B/Rel and IxB family members will almost certainly provide further insight into the regulation and physiology of the NF- « kB/ Rel signal transduction pathway .

Divergent functional roles for IxBa and IxBB in fibroblasts IxBa has been thought to be the key regulator of signal-dependent NF- « B activation .
However , our results demonstrate that IxBa is not essential for NF-xB induction in embryonic fibroblasts .
In these cells , IxBB is degraded specifically in response to TNFa suggesting that it may be primarily responsible for NF-KB activation in embryonic fibroblasts and perhaps other nonhematopoietic cell types .
Previous studies have concluded that TNFa or PMA can lead to the degradation of IxBa but not IxBB , suggesting that these proteins are targeted in a signal-dependent manner ( Thompson et al .
1995 ) .
However , our results suggest that there may be little specificity for targeting particular forms of IxB proteins in response to specific signals because both and IxBRB are degraded after TNFa treatment .
The levels of different forms of IxB proteins in different cell types may be the major determinant of which form plays a more significant role in NF- « B activation .
The relatively low levels of IxBa protein present in embryonic fibroblasts , in contrast to thy-mocytes , suggest that IxBB may be primarily responsible for the cytoplasmic retention and activation of NF- « B in those cells .
Although not required for the signal-dependent activation of NF-kB in embryonic fibroblasts , IxBa is necessary for its subsequent down-regulation .
Thus , IxBa may play a more general role in the down-regulation of NF- « B and NF- « B responsive genes after induction in many cell types .
In contrast to IxBB , IxBa mRNA synthesis is induced strongly in various cell types with stimulation of cells with NF-kB inducers ( Thompson et al .
1995 ) .
In addition , IxBa is evident in nuclei after stimulation of cells with NF- « B inducers , suggesting that newly synthesized IxBa enters the nucleus and actively removes NF- « B from « B sites ( Arenzana-Seisdedos et al .
1995 ) .
The results presented here indicate divergent physiological roles for IxBa and I « xBB , with IxBB being required for the activation of NF-kB and IkBa being necessary for its postinduction repression .
These studies have initiated an understanding of the relative roles of IxBa and IxBRB in control of NF- « B .
NF-kB is thought to play a role in responses of cells and organisms to such events as DNA damage [ Jung et al .
1995 ) , oxidative stress , and infectious diseases .
Further studies of genetically challenged mice should help elucidate the pathways involved in these responses .
Materials and methods / Generation of I « xBa~'~ mice The IxBa targeting vector was constructed using the pPNT plasmid { Tybulewicz et al .
1991 ) .
A human IxBa cDNA ( Haskill et al .
1991 ) was used to isolate clones from a 129/Sv mouse liver genomic library ( Stratagene ) .
Murine IxBa genomic clones were restriction mapped using the murine IxBa cDNA sequence ( pro-vided by Dr .
I. Verma , The Salk Institute , San Diego , CA ) .
We were interested in determining the expression of IxBa « during development .
Thus , the IxBa gene was fused in-frame to the 2744 GENES & DEVELOPMENT bacterial lacZ gene { derived from the BAP-1 plasmid provided by Dr. J. Dammell , The Rockefeller University , New York ) allowing colorimetric detection of IxBa expression .
This was accomplished by ligation of a 1.2-kb EcoRI-Pvull IxBe genomic fragment to a Hindlll-EcoRI LacZ fragment .
The resulting construct contained ~1.2 kb of sequence upstream of the IxBa translational start site , 13 nucleotides { four amino acids ) from the IxBa coding sequence , and the entire JacZ coding sequence joined in-frame to the IxBa coding sequence .
The sequence of the junction was ATGTTTCAGCCAGTATCGATACCG , with the IxBa sequence underlined .
Expression of this IxBa-LacZ fusion protein is readily detected in IxBa *'~ and IxBo~'~ mice .
The I « Ba-lacZ fragment was transferred to BamHI-Xbal-cut pPNT in the opposite transcriptional orientation from the phosphoglycerokinase [ PGK ) -neo gene to generate the plasmid pPNT-IxBa/LacZ .
An ~7-kb region of homology , 3 ' to the IxBo-coding sequence was isolated as a KpnI fragment from an IxBa genomic clone and inserted into the Xhol site of pPNT-IxBa/LacZ to generate the I « Ba targeting vector pPNT-IxBaKO .
The PGK-tk gene is 3 ' to the KpnI fragment in pPNT-IkxBaKOQ .
Homologous recombination of genomic DNA with pPNT-IxBaeKO , therefore , would result in the replacement of the IxBa gene with the bacterial lacZ gene .
pPNT-IxBaKO was linearized at a unique KprI site and elec-troporated into [ 1 ES cells ( Li et al .
1992 ) .
G418 and GANC-resistant colonies were isolated and genotyped by Southern blotting using an external DNA probe [ Fig .
1A ) .
Recombinant clones were injected into C57BL6/ ] blastocysts to obtain chimeric animals .
Heterozygous animals were obtained when male chimeric mice displaying > 70 % coat color chimerism were bred to C57BL6/ ] females .
Heterozygotes were interbred to obtain homozygotes .
Cell fractionation and Western blotting Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained as described previously ( Beg et al .
1993 ) .
Embryonic fibroblasts were lysed in the presence of buffer containing 0.3 % NP-40 , whereas all other cell types were lysed in a 0.1 % NP-40 buffer .
Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously .
The IxBa and IxBB antibodies ( Rice et al .
1992 ; Thompson et al .
1995 ) were provided by Dr. N. Rice and Dr. S. Ghosh , respectively .
The p105 antibody has been described previously ( Sha et al .
1995 ) .
Histological and FACScan analysis Mouse tissues were fixed in buffered formalin for 48 hr and then embedded in paraffin .
Sections of various tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin .
FACScan analysis was carried out as described previously using commercially available antibodies ( Sha et al .
1995 ) .
Cell culture and EMSA assays Embryonic fibroblasts were grown in DMEM + 10 % calf serum .
Embryonic fibroblasts were stimulated in the presence of 10 ng/ml TNFa ( GIBCO ) , 100 ng/ml of PMA ( Sigma ) , or 10 pg/ml of LPS ( Sigma ) for the time periods indicated in the text .
Nuclear extracts containing equal amounts of protein were tested for binding to an NF- « B-specific MHC class I hairpin DNA probe ( Fujita et al .
1992 ) or to an octamer-specific probe ( Singh et al .
1986 ) .
Antibodies against various members of the NF-kB family used here have been described previously ( Liou et al .
1994 ) .
