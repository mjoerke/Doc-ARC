To evaluate whether this enhancement is the primary role of AML1/ETO in leukemogenesis , effects of over-expression of Bcl-2 in the murine myeloid precursor cell line , 32Dcl3 , were examined .
When 32Dcl3 cells expressing exogenous Bcl-2 were induced to differentiate , the onset of morphological differentiation was delayed .
However , even the cells expressing very high levels of exogenous Bcl-2 eventually underwent differentiation without a significant decrease in the synthesis of Bcl-2 .
On the contrary , 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing AMLI/ETO were completely resistant to differentiation and continued to grow in the presence of G-CSF .
These results are consistent with the interpretation that stimulation of Bcl-2 expression is not the primary target of Keywords : AML1 ; AMLI/ETO ( MTG8 ) ; Bel-2 ; 32Dcl3 ; granulocytic differentiation Introduction The AMLlI gene was originally identified at the breakpoint of t ( 8 ; 21 ) acute myeloid leukemia ( Miyoshi et al. , 1991 ) and is now known to be the most frequent target of chromosome translocations associated with human leukemia including t ( 3 ; 21 ) and t ( 12 ; 21 ) ( Look , 1997 ) .
AML1 has an essential role in inducing definitive hematopoiesis and plays pivotal roles in regulating cell type specific genes in various hematopoietic cells ( Okuda et al. , 1996 ; Wang et al. , 1996 ; Sasaki et al. , 1996 ; Okada et al. , 1998 ) .
AML1 , also called polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2 « B gene ( PEBP2 « B ) or core binding factor A2 gene ( CBFA ?
) , is one of three mammalian Runt-domain-encoding genes and its product is the a subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor PEBP2/CBF ( re-viewed by Speck et al. , 1995 ; Ito , 1996 ; Ito et al. , 1997 ) .
In t ( 8 ; 21 ) AML , the N-terminal region of AML1I comprising the Runt domain , a highly conserved region required for DNA binding and heterodimeriza-tion with the B subunit , is fused to ETO ( MTG8 ) , generating the AMLI/ETO ( MTG8 ) fusion gene product ( Erickson et al. , 1992 ; Miyoshi et al. , 1993 ) .
In t ( 3 ; 21 ) , several fusion products are formed , the *Correspondence : Y Ito Received 24 November 1998 ; revised 25 January 1999 ; accepted 25 January 1999 major one being AMLI/EVI-1 in which the same N-terminal region of AML1 present in AMLI/ETO is fused to EVI-1 ( Nucifora et al. , 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ; Mitani et al. , 1994 ) .
In the case of t ( 12 ; 21 ) , the chimeric protein produced , termed TEL/AML1 , contains the N-terminal half of a member of the Ets family , TEL , fused to the entire AML1I on the C-terminal side ( Golub et al. , 1995 ; Romana et al. , 1995 ) .
All of these chimeric proteins retain the Runt domain of AML1 , suggesting their potential ability to bind to DNA and interact with the B subunit .
In addition , the gene encoding the B subunit of PEBP2 is involved in the chromosome anomaly associated with inv ( 16 ) acute myeloid leukemia ( Liu et al. , 1993 ) .
In this case , the chimeric gene , B/MYH11 encoding the chimeric protein , B/SMMHC , is produced .
B/SMMHC contains the C-terminal coiled-coil region of SMMHC ( smooth muscle myosine heavy chain ) fused to the C-terminal region of the B subunit protein .
This chimeric protein forms a dimer with AML1 more readily than the normal B subunit ( Lu et al. , 1995 ; Kanno et al. , 1998 ) .
We and others have shown that these chimeric genes strongly inhibit the activity of a variety of promoters through the PEBP2 sites , including T cell receptor B enhancer/promoter ( Meyers et al. , 1995 , 1996 ; Tanaka et al. , 1995 ; Hiebert et al. , 1996 ) , GM-CSF promoter ( Frank et al. , 1995 ) , IL-3 promoter ( Uchida et al. , 1997 ) , M-CSF receptor promoter ( Fears et al. , 1997 ; Kanno et al. , 1998 ) and Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer ( Liu et al. , 1994 ) .
Recently , it has been reported that eight out of 160 patients with leukemia have point mutations in AML1 .
These mutations are all clustered in the Runt domain .
Three heterozygous mutants of AML1 show neither DNA binding nor transactivation .
These loss-of-function mutations may be related to predisposition to , or the progression of leukemia .
In two other cases , biallelic nonsense mutants were found which encode AML1 truncated within the Runt domain .
In these two cases , essentially all of the AMLI function was destroyed ( Osato et al. , 1999 ) .
These results coupled with the observations mentioned above that chimeric genes involving AML1 or the B subunit gene strongly inhibit transcription lead to a hypothesis that a loss of AML1 function at appropriate stage of myeloid cell development plays a role in leukemogenesis .
In contradiction of the above hypothesis , Bcl-2 ( Klampfer et al. , 1996 ) and macrophage colony stimulation factor ( M-CSF ) receptor promoters ( Rhoades et al. , 1996 ) are upregulated by AMLI/ ETO .
A PEBP2 binding site has been identified in the 5 untranslated region of the Bel-2 gene , and AMLI1/ ETO , but not AML1 or ETO , activates transcription of Bcel-2 ( Klampfer et al. , 1996 ) .
The Bcl-2 gene was Inability of Bcl-2 to block differentiation of 32DcI13 H Kohzaki et al 4056 first identified at the breakpoint of t ( 14 ; 18 ) follicular lymphoma ( Bakhshi et al. , 1985 ; Cleary et al. , 1985 ; Tsujimoto et al. , 1985 ) .
Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of Bel-2 to protect cells of lymphoid , myeloid and neuronal lineages from apoptosis ( Reed , 1994 ) .
Genes that regulate cell death are potentially important targets for leukemogenic chimeric transcription factors .
AML1I/ETO ( MTG8 ) blocks differentiation of Kasumi-1 cells harboring t ( 8 ; 21 ) obtained from an acute myeloid leukemia patient ( Asou et al. , 1991 ) .
A similar differentiation block can be observed in the murine myeloid progenitor cell line , 32Dcl3 ( Valtieri et a/. , 1987 ) or L-G ( Kinashi et al. , 1991 ) , which requires interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) for growth and undergoes granulocytic differentiation when IL-3 is replaced by G-CSF .
Stable expression of AMLI/ETO or AML1/ EVI-1 prevent G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation in 32Dcl3 ( Ahn et al. , 1998 ; Tanaka et al. , 1995 ) or L-G cells ( Kitabayashi et al. , 1998 ) .
Using this cell system , we evaluated whether upregulation of Bcl-2 by AML1I/ETO is the primary role of the chimeric gene in gross changes of growth and differentiation properties of 32Dcl3 cells .
Results Elevated levels of Bel-2 in cell lines carrying AML1/ ETO ( MTG8 ) and B/SMMHC Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells derived from t ( 8 ; 21 ) acute myeloid leukemia patients and expressing AMLI/ETO have elevated levels of Bel-2 protein compared with cell lines obtained from acute myeloid leukemia patients not harboring AML1/ETO ( Klampfer et al. , 1996 ) .
We confirmed that the Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cell lines synthesized elevated levels of Bcel-2 proteins compared to the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line , U937 and promyelocytic leukemia cell line , HL-60 ( Figure 1 ) .
ME-1 cells harboring inv ( 16 ) synthesize the chimeric protein , B/SMMHC .
Like AMLI/ETO , B/SMMHC deregulates the expression of genes which are the target of AML1 ( Liu et al. , 1994 ; Kanno et al. , 1998 ) .
As shown in Figure 1 , ME-1 cells also express elevated levels of Bel-2 compared with U937 and K562 cells .
Rapid decrease of Bel-2 levels in 32DcIl3 cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation The murine myeloid progenitor cell line , 32Dcl3 , requires IL-3 for growth .
32Dcl3 cells continue to grow for about 6 days after replacement of IL-3 with G-CSF , then undergo gross morphological differentiation on , or around day 7 and thereafter gradually lose viability under the conditions used ( Figure 2A ) .
In 32Dcl3 cells , Bcel-2 protein was expressed in the presence of IL-3 but the level of expression decreased rapidly after replacing IL-3 with G-CSF ( Figure 2B ) .
On day 4 in the G-CSF containing medium , Bcl-2 protein became undetectable .
At this time point , cells still did not show any morphological changes .
We and others have shown that AMLI/ETO blocks differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells induced by G-CSF ( Ahn et al. , 1998 ; Kitabayashi et al. , 1998 ) .
We confirmed the observation : 32Dc13 cells stably expressing AML1/ ETO continue to grow up to 10 days even after IL-3 was replaced with G-CSF ( Figure 2A ) .
Under such conditions , the level of the Bel-2 expression was maintained at the level observed in the presence of IL-3 ( Figure 2C ) .
Expression of exogenous Bel-2 increases survival of 32Dcl3 cells The rapid decrease of Bel-2 levels during granulocytic differentiation and the unaltered expression of Bcl-2 in the cells stably expressing AMLI/ETO even in the presence of G-CSF raised the possibility that a decrease of Bel-2 levels is a prerequisite for differentiation .
To examine this possibility , 32Dcl3 cells expressing exogenous murine Bcl-2 from a constitu-tively active promoter ( 32D-Bcl2 ) were obtained and the influence of exogenous Bcl-2 on the cells was tested .
Over-expression of Bel-2 has been shown to delay apoptosis in a number of cytokine-dependent cell lines upon cytokine deprivation ( Nunez et al. , 1990 ; Baffy et al. , 1993 ; Rodel et al. , 1996 ) and to mediate the survival signal provided by cytokines ( Lin et al. , 1996 ) .
Therefore , to examine whether expression of exogenous Bcl-2 can prevent cell death , 32D-Bcl2 was tested for survival after removal of IL-3 .
Parental 32Dcl3 cells rapidly lost viability in medium containing serum lacking IL-3 or G-CSF and within 48 h of culture in the absence of IL-3 most of the cells were non-viable .
These observations are consistent with previous reports ( Nunez et al. , 1990 ; Baffy et al. , 1993 ; Rodel et al. , 1996 ) .
On the contrary , the cell number of 32D-Bcl2 doubled after the removal of IL-3 before losing viability , and about 50 % of the cells were still alive 4.5 days after the removal of cytokine .

The level of expression of Bel-2 in 32D-Bcl2 was about 7.5 times as much as that of the parental cells or 32D-neo as revealed by immunoblot analysis ( see Figure 4A ) .
Interestingly , 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing AML1/ ETO , 32D-AMLI/ETO did not show a significant increase in survival in the absence of IL-3 , despite the fact that these cells grew continuously in the presence of G-CSF under conditions that induced parental cell differentiation ( Figure 2A ) .
Over-expression of Bel-2 delays differentiation of 32Dcl3 Next , the influence of over-expression of Bcl-2 on differentiation was examined .
When cultured in IL-3 containing medium , 32D-Bcl2 maintained the morphology of myeloid precursor cells like parental or 32D-neo cells Also the growth rate of these cells was indistinguishable ( data not shown ) .
When IL-3 was replaced with G-CSF , 32D-neo cells stopped growing and underwent differentiation around day 8 like parental cells ( Figures 2A and 4B ) .
On the contrary , 32D-Bcl2 continued to multiply beyond day 8 up until day 12 without showing any sign of morphological differentiation .

In other words , exogenous Bcel-2 delayed but did not completely block granulocytic differentiation .
In addition , the rate of decrease of the viable cell number was significantly lower than that of 32D-neo , consistent with the increase in the survival rate of these cells described above ( Figure 3 ) .
It is important to note that the high levels of Bcl-2 expression from the exogenously introduced constitutive promoter were maintained in 32D-Bcel2 throughout the period examined , even after morphological differentiation became evident and viability of the cells declined ( Figure 4C ) .
This is in contrast to 32D-neo in which Bcl-2 was no longer detectable on day 6 ( Figure 4C ) .
Since the results shown in Figure 4A , B and C were obtained with a population of cells expressing Bel-2 at different levels , we examined the effect of exogenous Bcl-2 more precisely using individual cell clones obtained from these cell cultures .
Levels of expression of Bcel-2 in independent clones varied widely as revealed by Western blotting ( Figure 4D ) .
We chose clone 20 ( cl-20 ) , clone 6 ( cl-6 ) and clone 9 ( cl-9 ) as low- , moderate- and high-level expressors of Bcl-2 respectively .
Relative levels of expression of Bcl-2 in cl-20 , cl-6 , cl-9 and the parent cells were 1.6 , 7.4 , 9.5 and 1.0 , respectively .
The growth curve and the timing of morphological differentiation of cl-20 in G-CSF was indistinguishable from those of the parental cells .
cl-6 and cl-9 , on the other hand , stopped growing on day 9 and day 12 , respectively ( Figure 4E ) and underwent morphological changes ( Figure 5 ) .
The results indicated a correlation between the levels of Bcl-2 expression , the timing of differentiation and the slope of the decrease of viable cell number after differentiation .
In other words , the higher the level of Bel-2 expressed , the slower the timing of differentiation and the less steep the decline in viable cell number .
Taken together , the results indicated that over-expression of Bel-2 reduces the cell death that accompanies granulocytic differentiation 4057 Inability of Bcl-2 to block differentiation of 32DcI13 H Kohzaki et al 4058 ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) 108 to G-CSF a = | m 8 2 _ 3 & 8 fr 32D-Bel2 A Q Q 3 ~-5C 32D-Bci2 - C @ apepec-s-c & & ® A E a =106 32D-neo Bel-2 - e- s 32D-neo - > ® -= - > 10 2 3 2 4 6 B8 10 12 0 5 - 10 15 20 25 days G-CSF ( days ) ( D ) 5 clone number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14151617 181920 § Bel-2 - -- a -angpan o -- -- < -- -- « Dame ( E ) ( F ) 109 cl-9 _ 108 € 5 cl-9 - -Bel-2 € § 107 2 cl-6 e iy } < .

Discussion Although Bcl-2 was expressed at elevated levels in leukemic cell lines synthesizing AMLI/ETO or B/ SMMHC , over-expression of exogenous Bcel-2 , even at very high levels , did not completely block G-CSF induction of the granulocytic differentiation of the murine myeloid progenitor cell line , 32Dcl3 .
This is in contrast to AML1I/ETO which was able to completely block the differentiation of these cells .
These results suggest that the major target of AML1I/ETO is unlikely to be upregulation of Bcel-2 , although upregulation of Bcl-2 would contribute to leukemogenesis by increasing resistance to cell death .
Earlier studies have shown that overexpression of Bcl-2 has little or no effect on cell differentiation or proliferation ( Vaux et al. , 1988 ; Nunez et al. , 1990 ) .
Despite these reports , expression of Bcel-2 was shown to be stimulated by AMLI/ETO , implying that stimulation of Bcl-2 expression is one factor in the Inability of Bcl-2 to block differentiation of 32DcI13 H Kohzaki et al cl-9 we * $ 3 s fhe % Figure 5 - May-Griinwald-Giemsa staining of the subclones cl-9 and cl-20 of 32D-Bcl2 .

Furthermore , Lin et al .
( 1996 ) also reported the possibility of inhibition of differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells by Bcl-2 .
For the induction of differentiation , however , they removed IL-3 .
Under such conditions , 32Dcl3 cells died rapidly and only a small portion of the cells ( 5-20 % ) showed morphological changes .
In the present study , after replacement of IL-3 with G-CSF , cells continued to grow for several days and virtually all of the cells underwent gross morphological changes .
Thus , our experimental design is likely to reflect more closely physiological conditions and provide a better basis for the analysis of the effect of Bel-2 .
Although up-regulation of Bel-2 in cell lines carrying t ( 8 ; 21 ) was observed in the present study , the question still remains as to whether primary leukemic cells with t ( 8 ; 21 ) actually express higher levels of Bel-2 in vivo .
Recently , Banker et al .
( 1998 ) reported that the t ( 8 ; 21 ) translocation was not consistently associated with high Bcl-2 expression in de novo .
Earlier , Bcel-2 expression was reported to be negatively regulated by p53 8 Inability of Bcl-2 to block differentiation of 32DcI13 H Kohzaki et al 4060 ( Miyashita et al. , 1994 ) .
Kampfer et al. , ( 1996 ) , however , did not find a correlation between the presence of p53 and the levels of Bel-2 expression in leukemic cell lines .
In the most recent study , Banker et al .
( 1998 ) examined the p53 mutation in t ( 8 ; 21 ) -bearing cell lines as well as in primary AML cells and found that cell lines had mutation in p53 but primary cells did not .
Based on these results , they speculated that p53 mutations may contribute to higher Bcl-2 expression levels in leukemia cell lines .
Although further studies are required to unequivocally clarify the mechanisms by which Bcl-2 expression is modified by AMLI/ETO or p53 in primary leukemic cells , overall conclusion of Banker and others is entirely consistent with ours obtained in the current study .
Expression of AMLI/ETO alone is not considered to be sufficient to convert normal myeloid cells to leukemic cells , since some patients in remission have cells expressing AMLI/ETO .
Furthermore , transgenic mice containing tetracyclin-inducible AMLI/ETO did not develop leukemia upon induction of the gene in the myeloid lineage ( Don-Er Zhang , personal communica-tion ) .
The primary event induced by AMLI/ETO might be upregulation of Bcel-2 , even if over-expression of Bel-2 is not sufficient to induce leukemia .
However , as summarized above , the phenotypes of 32Dcl3 cells over-expressing Bcl-2 and AML1I/ETO are so different that this interpretation appears unlikely .
The chimeric protein , B/SMMHC , interacts with AML1 more efficiently than the normal B subunit and sequesters AML1 to the cytoplasm .
As a result of this interaction , the level of functional PEBP2 is presumed to be insufficient in nuclei , resulting in deregulation of genes under the control of PEBP2 ( Kanno et al. , 1998 ) .
In accordance with this observation , B/SMMHC severely represses promoter activities ( Liu et al. , 1994 ; Kanno et al. , 1998 ) .
It is interesting to note that ME-1 cells expressing B/SMMHC express Bcl-2 at levels even higher than those observed in Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells .
If the molecular mechanisms of upregulation of Bcl-2 by AML1/ETO and B/SMMHC are the same , we must consider the possibility that AMLI/ETO stimulates the Bcl-2 promoter by derepressing transcription through the PEBP2 site .
Detailed studies will be required to clarify this issue .
Although AML1I/ETO stimulates expression of Bel-2 by acting directly on the regulatory region of the Bcl-2 gene , sustained expression of Bcl-2 in 32D-AML1I/ETO appears to be due to a different mechanism as discussed below .
Over-expression of exogenous Bcl-2 did not block differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells .
However , continuously growing 32Dcl3 cells in the presence of G-CSF appeared to be prevented from downregulating Bcl-2 expression .
As discussed above , the reason why 32Dcl3 cells expressing AMLI/ETO were able to grow continuously in the presence of G-CSF was not because of AMLI/ETO induced Bcel-2 expression .
Rather , it seems possible that Bcl-2 expression is not inhibited in such cells even in the presence of G-CSF .
We reported earlier that Ear-2 , a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family , blocked differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells and that cells expressing Ear-2 continued to grow in the presence of G-CSF ( Ahn et al. , 1998 ) .
Interestingly , we observed continuous expression of Bel-2 in 32Dcl3 cells expressing Ear-2 in the presence of G-CSF ( data not shown ) .
Parental 32Dc13 cells use G-CSF as a differentiation factor but both AML1/ETO and Ear-2 are able to induce 32Dc¢l3 cells into using G-CSF as a growth factor .
It would be physiologically meaningful for cells to continue to express Bcl-2 during growth and to downregulate Bcl-2 expression during differentiation .
Therefore , the cells expressing AMLI/ETO may have acquired the ability to prevent downregulation of Bel-2 in the presence of G-CSF by the mechanism which subverted the cells into interpreting G-CSF signals as those of a growth factor .
From this point of view , the continuous expression of Bcl-2 in 32Dcl3 cells expressing AML1/ ETO could still be a consequence of the function of AMLI/ETO , although the mechanism is completely different from that suggested by Klampfer et al .
( 1996 ) .
How 32Dcl3 cells are transformed by AMLI/ETO to read signals from G-CSF as those of a growth factor will be critically important for our understanding of the mechanism of leukemogenesis .
One obstacle to our hypothesis that a loss of AML1 function predisposes to leukemia is the observed AMLI/ETO stimulation of Bel-2 expression .
The results shown in this paper suggest that this is not a serious obstacle .
Stimulation of the M-CSF receptor by AML1I/ETO needs to be examined in more detail .
Materials and methods Cells and culture Murine myelomonocytic cell line , WEHI-3B , ( Warner et a/. , 1969 ) and human myeloid leukemia cell lines , Kasumi-1 ( Asou et al. , 1991 ) and SKNO-1 ( Matozaki et al. , 1995 ) harboring t ( 8 ; 21 ) , HL-60 ( Collins et al. , 1977 ; Rovera et al. , 1979 ; Breitmann et a/. , 1980 ) , U937 ( Sundstrom et al. , 1976 ) , K562 ( Lozzio et al. , 1975 ) and ME-1 harboring inv ( 16 ) ( Yanagisawa et al. , 1991 ) were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 20 % ( Kasumi-1 ) or 10 % ( HL-60 , SKNO-1 , ME-1 , U937 , K562 and WEHI-3B ) fetal bovine serum ( culture medium , CM ) .
A murine interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) dependent myeloid progenitor cell line derived from normal bone marrow long-term culture , 32Dcl3 ( Vailtieri et al. , 1987 ) , was maintained in RPMI1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum supplemented with 5 % WEHI-3B culture supernatant as a source of IL-3 ( IL-3 medium ) .
Plasmid constructions To construct the mouse Bel-2 expression plasmid , pEF-BOSneoKR , the Xhol fragment containing the coding sequence for mouse Bcl-2 from pSKMBKR ( obtained from M Tsujimoto of Osaka University ) ( Negrini et al. , 1987 ) and pEF-BOSneo ( Mizushima er a/. , 1990 ) digested with Xbal were blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase and ligated .
Establishment of 32Dcl3 stable transformants 32Dcl3 cells ( 5x 10° ) were washed three times in HeBS ( HEPES-buffered saline , pH 7.05 ) ( Ausubel et a/. , 1987 ) and resuspended in 280 ul of HeBS .
Twenty ug of pEF-BOSneoKR or pEF-BOSneo in 20 ul of TE was mixed with the cells and transferred to cuvettes with a 0.2 cm gap ( Bio-Rad ) .
Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulser ( Bio-Rad ) at 270 V , 960 uF .
Samples were transferred to the IL-3 medium and incubated .
Forty-eight hours later , G418 ( GIBCO ) was added at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml .
Clones of stable transfectants were selected by limiting dilution .
The isolation of AML1I/ETO stable transformants was described previously ( Ahn et a/. , 1998 ) .
Induction of differentiation For the induction of granulocytic differentiation , 32Dcl3 or its derivatives were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and cultured in the medium containing 500 U/ml of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( rhG-CSF ) ( Kirin Beer , Japan ) .
The medium was changed every 2 days with fresh G-CSF .
For morphological examination , cells were washed with PBS twice and deposited onto glass slides by Cytospin and stained with May -Griinwald-Giemsa for microscopic examination .
Cell survival assays Cells in logarithmic growth phase were washed three times with fresh CM with no added cytokines and cultured in the same medium in triplicate at a cell density of 4x 10° cells/ml .
The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue staining ( Rodel et a/. , 1996 ) .
Preparation of whole cell extracts and Western blotting Cells ( 5x 10° ) were pelleted and suspended in 50 ul of SDS sample buffer containing 62.2 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 6.8 ) , 50 mm References Ahn MY , Huang G , Bae SC , Wee HJ , Kim WY and Ito Y .

Inability of Bcl-2 to block differentiation of 32DcI13 H Kohzaki et al DTT , 2 % sodium laurylsulfate ( SDS ) , 10 % glycerol , 0.1 % bromphenolblue and 0.1 % xylene cyanol , sonicated for 20 s and boiled for 5 min .
Ten ul of each cell extract was subjected to 15 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( Ito et al. , 1996 ) and proteins were transferred to ImmobilonTM ( MILLIPORE ) .
Bel-2 protein was detected by anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody ( Transduction Laboratory ) and ECL immunodetection system ( Amersham ) .
Bcl-2 protein detected by Western blotting was quantified with Quantity one ( PDI , Inc. ) .
