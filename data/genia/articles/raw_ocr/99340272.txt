The Epstein-Barr Virus Oncoprotein Latent Membrane Protein 1 Engages the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Proteins TRADD and Receptor-Interacting Protein ( RIP ) but Does Not Induce Apoptosis or Require RIP for NF- « kB Activation KENNETH M. IZUMI , ' ELLEN CAHIR McFARLAND , !

We now find that LMP1 signaling through TRADD differs from TNFR1 signaling through TRADD .
LMP1 needs only 11 amino acids to activate NF-KB or synergize with TRADD in NF-KB activation , while TNFR1 requires ~70 residues .
Further , LMP1 does not require TRADD residues 294 to 312 for NF-KB activation , while TNFR1 requires TRADD residues 296 to 302 .
LMP1 is partially blocked for NF-KB activation by a TRADD mutant consisting of residues 122 to 293 .
Unlike TNFR1 , LMP1 can interact directly with receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) and stably associates with RIP in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines .
Surprisingly , LMP1 does not require RIP for NF-KB activation .
Despite constitutive association with TRADD or RIP , LMP does not induce apoptosis in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells .
These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which LMP1 , TRADD , and RIP participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latent infection membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) is essential for EBV-mediated growth transformation of resting primary human B lymphocytes into indefinitely proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) ( 30 ) .
Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the signal transduction pathway through which LMP1 mediates B-lymphocyte growth transformation resembles those of activated tumor necrosis factor receptors ( TNFR ) ( 26 , 28 , 31 , 43 ) .
LMP1 consists of a 24-amino-acid N-terminal cytoplasmic domain , six transmembrane domains , and a 200-amino-acid C-terminal cytoplasmic tail ( Fig .
1 ) .
Although no specific sequence of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is essential for growth transformation , the N terminus fulfills a critical structural role by tethering the first transmembrane domain to the cytoplasm ( 25 , 30 ) .
The six transmembrane domains collectively enable LMP1 to self-aggregate in the plasma membrane similarly to a capped receptor .
Aggregation of LMP1 in the plasma membrane causes two specific sites within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail to constitutively mediate essential transforming signals through association with proteins that ordinarily mediate li-gand-induced signals from activated TNFR family members ( 7 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 25 , 31 , 50 , 56 ) .
These two transformation effector sites ( TES1 and TES2 ) are within C-terminal NF-kB activating regions CTAR1 and CTAR2 ( 24 , 42 ) .

5759 TES1/CTAR1 ( residues 187 to 231 [ Fig .
1 ] ) interacts with TNFR-associated factors ( TRAFs ) and is sufficient for mediating initial B-lymphocyte growth transformation ( 31 , 43 ) .
TRAF1 , TRAF2 , and TRAFS mediate NF-KB activation from TES1/CTAR1 ( 4 , 10 , 43 , 49 ) .
Deletion of the TRAF interaction site results in EBV recombinants that are unable to growth transform primary B lymphocytes ( 26 ) .
The TES1I/ CTAR1 amino acid sequence is similar to sites in CD40 and CD30 that are critical for NF-KB activation ( 9 , 40 ) .
CD40 is the receptor for a T-cell surface ligand that activates B-lymphocyte growth and differentiation ( 2 , 8 , 32 , 44 ) , and CD30 is the receptor for a T-cell surface ligand that can negatively affect heavy-chain class switching ( 5 , 36 ) .
In retrospect , LMP1 mimicry of an activated TNFR is not surprising given the similar effects of LMP1 and CD40 on B-lymphocyte growth and gene activation ( 2 , 8 , 9 , 23 , 29 , 32 , 44 , 47 ) .
TES2/CTAR2 is at the LMP1 C terminus and activates NF-kB through the TNFR1-associated death domain protein TRADD ( 28 ) .
The adverse consequences of mutation of the three C-terminal LMP1 codons from YYD to ID on TRADD interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , on TRADD association in mammalian cells , on NF-kB activation , on TRADD synergy with LMP1 in NF-kB activation , and on B-lymphocyte growth transformation link TRADD to these TES2/CTAR2 effects ( 28 ) .
The tyrosines are not specifically required since substitution with codons encoding phenylala-nine is indistinguishable from wild type in TRADD association in lymphocytes , in NF-kB activation , and in B-lymphocyte growth transformation ( 28 ) .
Thus , at this level of genetic anal-ysis , TES2 appears to coincide with CTAR2 ( 15 ) , and TRADD is a key signal-transducing intermediate .

The Flag epitope was introduced at the amino terminus ( NH , ) .

LMP1 constitutively aggregates in the plasma membrane and associates with TRAFs , TRADD , and RIP .
TES1 aggregates TRAFs to mediate low-level NF- « B activation and initial B-lymphocyte growth transformation .
TES2 aggregates RIP or TRADD , both of which associate with TRAFs to mediate high-level NF-kB activation and enable permanent LCL outgrowth .
sociation of LMP1 with TRADD in LCLs ( 28 ) contrasts with TNFR1 , which recruits TRADD in response to ligand binding and receptor aggregation ( 22 , 21 ) .
The objective of the experiments reported here was to investigate further the biochemistry of LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 interaction with TRADD and the expected proapoptotic effects .
Since receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) is implicated in TNFR1 and TRADD-mediated activation of NF-kB and apoptosis ( 20 , 33 , 51 , 54 ) , we also investigated the role of RIP in TES2/CTAR2-mediated signaling .

RESULTS LMP1 residues 376 to 386 engage TRADD to mediate NF-KB activation .
TRADD interaction with LMP1 was originally identified as the result of a yeast two-hybrid screen with LMP1 amino acids 355 to 386 ( 28 ) .
A yeast two-hybrid assay was used to delineate more precisely the TES2/CTAR2 residues ( 355 to 386 [ Fig .
1 ] ) required for TRADD interaction .
LMP1 amino acids 182 to 386 comprising TES1/CTAR1 and TES2/CTAR2 ( Fig .
1 ) were fused to the Gal4 DBD so that interaction of TES1/CTAR1 with a Gal4 AD-TRAF3 fusion could serve as a positive control for bait expression .
TRADD interacted with the LMP1 bait at a substantially lower level than TRAF3 ( Table 1 ) .
Deletion of amino acids 356 to 365 , 366 to 371 , or 372 to 375 ( in F-LMP1A356-365 , F-LMP1A366-371 , or F-LMP1A372-375 ) did not substantially weaken TRADD interaction , whereas deletion of amino acids 374 to 386 abrogated TRADD interaction , similar to the effect of the Y354 YD38e-to-ID mutation ( in F-LMP1AID ) ( Table 1 ) .
None of these deletions affected TRAF3 interaction .
Since LMP1 amino acids 355 to 386 are sufficient for TRADD interaction and residues 356 to 365 , 366 to 371 , or 372 to 375 are not critical , the critical residues are likely to be from positions 376 to 386 .
To correlate the TRADD-LMP1 interaction in yeast cells with NF- « B activation in mammalian cells , an F-LMP1 TES2/ CTAR2 expression vector , F-LMP1A , was constructed by fusing codons 352 to 386 in frame with and 3 ' to codons encoding the LMP1 amino terminus and six transmembrane domains ( Fig .
1 ) .
F-LMP1A and TRADD are potent activators of NF-kB in HEK293 cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
Consistent with the yeast data , deletion of residues 356 to 365 , 366 to 372 , or 373 to 375 had minimal effect on F-LMP1A-mediated NF-KB activation , whereas deletion of residues 374 to 386 or mutation of the terminal Y ; 5 , YD ; g , residues to ID did not activate NF-kB ( Fig .
2A ) .
TRADD overexpression activated NF-kB and synergistically activated NF-kB with F-LMP1A356-365 , F-LMP1A366-372 , or F-LMP1A373-375 vectors .
We speculate that TRADD overexpression increases TRADD concentration and TRADD association with LMP1 , resulting in synergistic NF-kB activation .
No synergy was found with F-LMP1A374-386 or for F-LMP1AID .
These results confirm that LMP1 amino acids TABLE 1 .

( A ) Characterization of the LMP1 residues critical for engaging TRADD to synergistically activate NF-kB .
Five million HEK293 cells were electroporated with 30 ug of pSGS or TES2/CTAR2 vector F-LMP1A , 5 ug of TRADD vector where indicated , 2.5 pg of 3x-kB-L luciferase reporter , which has three copies of a major histocompatibility complex class I kB element and minimal fos promoter , and 2.5 pg of glucokinase promoter/B-galactosidase reporter to monitor transfection efficiency ; 18 h later , lysates were analyzed for luciferase ( Promega ) and B-galactosidase ( Tropix ) according to the manufactur-ers ' directions on an Opticomp I luminometer .
The base wild-type F-LMP1A vector is deleted for residues 187 to 351 .
Further deletions are indicated .
ID indicates mutation of the terminal residues Y35 , YD35 , to ID .
Standard error of means are reported .
In data not shown , protein levels of TRADD or LMP1 mutants were equivalent in separate transfections as analyzed by Western im-munoblotting .
( B ) The 11 terminal residues of LMP1 are sufficient to engage TRADD to synergistically activate NF-kB .
F-LMP1 vectors deleted for residues 187 to 375 or with a short stuffer consisting of residues HGHLGASLQY inserted between residues 186 and 376 were electroporated into HEK293 cells and analyzed as described for panel A .
374 to 386 are critical for TES2/CTAR2-mediated NF-kB activation and for synergy with TRADD in NF- « B activation .
To test whether LMP1 residues 376 to 386 are sufficient for TRADD interaction and NF-kB activation , codons for these LMP1 SIGNALS TRANSFORMATION THROUGH TRADD AND RIP _ 5761 residues were cloned in frame and 3 ' to codons for the LMP1 N terminus and six membrane-spanning domains to create F-LMP1A187-375 .
When transfected into HEK293 cells , F-LMP1A187-375 did not activate NF-kB or synergize with TRADD ( Fig .
2B ) .
Since the inactivity of the terminal 11 amino acids could be due to their proximity to the plasma membrane , we tested another construct that has a 10-amino-acid stuffer ( HGHLGASLQY ) inserted between the last transmembrane domain and amino acids 376 to 386 .
This construct , F-LMP1A187-375+stuffer , induced almost 50 % of the NF-kB activity of F-LMP1A ( Fig .
2B ) .
Further , F-LMP1A187-375+ stuffer synergized with TRADD in NF- « B activation and conveyed 70 % of the synergistic effect of F-LMP1IA ( Fig .
2B ) .
These results indicate that the C-terminal 11 amino acids are sufficient for TRADD interaction and NF-KB activation .
LMP1 can synergize with TRADD mutants that are unable to engage TRAFs or efficiently interact with the TNFR1 death domain .
The TRADD cDNA clone that interacted in the yeast two-hybrid screen with LMP1 residues 355 to 386 consists of amino acids 195 to 312 and comprises the entire TRADD death domain ( 22 , 28 ) .
To determine whether a smaller TRADD sequence could interact with LMP1 , TRADD deletion mutations were tested for the ability to synergize with LMP1 in NF-kB activation ( Fig .
3 ) .
TRADD 1-293 is competent for TRAF interactions and for some death domain interactions but is markedly diminished in TNFR1 death domain interaction and self-aggregation-mediated NF-kB activation ( 22 , 45 ) .
TRADD 122-312 is unable to interact with TRAFs but has a complete death domain that can activate NF- « B when overexpressed .
TRADD 122-293 is unable to interact with TRAFs and has an incomplete death domain that cripples TNFR1 interaction or self-aggregation-mediated NF-KB activation ( 22 , 45 ) .
While it was , as expected , more than 50 % deficient in NF- « B activation , TRADD lacking residues 294 to 312 ( TRADD 1-293 ) retained 70 % of wild-type TRADD syn- 50 pe 1 g 40-m ) [ IL I 5 -A m - 30 > |£ u I z = .

ergy with LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 ( Fig .
3 ) .
LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 synergized even better with TRADD 122-312 despite the inability of TRADD 122-312 to directly recruit TRAFs .
Since a dominant negative TRAF2 can block TES2/CTAR2 induction of TES2/CTAR2 and TRADD synergy in NF-kB activation ( 28 ) , these data indicate that TRADD 122-312 can aggregate with wild-type TRADD , RIP , or other proteins that can recruit TRAFs ( 20 , 33 , 51 , 54 ) .
Overexpression of TRADD 122-293 , which lacks a complete death domain and can not interact with TRAFs , failed to activate NF-kB and reduced LMP1 TES2/ CTAR2-mediated NF-KB activation by about 30 % .
This dominant negative effect is consistent with the notion that TRADD signaling from TES2/CTAR2 requires the ability of TRADD to recruit TRAFs or other proteins that can recruit TRAFs .
Deletion of TRADD residues 294 to 312 probably compromises recruitment of death domain proteins that can recruit TRAF2 , while the deletion of residues 1 to 121 abrogates direct TRAF recruitment .
RIP interacts with LMP1 .
The potential interaction of RIP with LMP1 was evaluated in a yeast two-hybrid assay in comparison with TRAF3 and TRADD ( Table 2 ) .
RIP interacted directly with LMP1 residues 182 to 386 , and mutation of the LMP1 C-terminal Y35 , YD ; 35 , to ID weakened RIP interaction .
Overall , the interaction of LMP1 with RIP was somewhat weaker than that with TRADD .
As expected , deletion of LMP1 residues 185 to 211 , which includes the core TRAF binding site , abrogated TRAF3 interaction but did not affect RIP interaction .
Moreover , RIP did not interact with residues 187 to 231 whereas TRAF3 bound efficiently to residues 187 to 231 .
Surprisingly , RIP did not interact with LMP1 amino acids 355 to 386 although this sequence is sufficient for TRADD interaction ( 28 ) .
These data indicate that RIP interacts with LMP1 , probably through TES2/CTAR2 , as evidenced by the adverse effect of the YYD-to-ID mutation , but with a broader or different sequence requirement than TRADD .
We further investigated RIP , TRADD , and TRAF3 binding to LMP1 by doubly transforming yeast with Gal4 DBD-LMP1 C-terminal tail vectors as bait and Gal4 AD-RIP , -TRADD , and -TRAF3 fusion protein expression vectors as prey .
The extent of interaction was then assayed by in situ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-B-p-galactopyranoside ( X-Gal ) color conversion using doubly selected , actively growing individual yeast colonies .
This assay assesses the extent of interaction among different yeast clones where individual clones have different numbers of copies of the two expression vectors .

Most doubly transfected yeast clones were blue by 2 h and dark blue by 4 h. TRADD and RIP interacted with LMP1 at substantially lower levels , with blue to dark blue coloration developing in only 19 % of the TRADD clones and 7 % of the RIP clones by 20 h. Dark blue coloration was unusual even at 20 h. A similar hierarchy of slightly stronger TRADD than RIP interaction was evident in light blue coloration at 2 h , with 12 % for TRADD and none for RIP .

Coimmunoprecipitation of RIP or TRADD with F-LMP1 .
Proteins from LCLs ( 2.0 x 10° cells ) infected with an EBV recombinant expressing F-LMP1 or wild-type LMP1 were solubilized by Dounce disruption in 0.5 % Brij 58-100 mM NaCl-50 mM Tris ( pH 7.2 ) and immunoprecipitated with a Flag-specific M2 affinity gel ( Kodak ) .
Precipitated proteins were Western blotted with antisera to RIP ( Pharmingen ) , TRADD ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or S12 monoclonal antibody to LMP1 .
Input lanes represent unfractionated cell pro-teins , unbound lanes represent proteins not precipitated with M2 affinity gel , and Imm Ppt lanes represent immunoprecipitated proteins .
Percentages indicate fractions of total samples analyzed .
Both TRADD and RIP interacted better with wild-type LMP1 than with the ID mutant .
In summary , TES1/CTAR1 interaction with TRAF3 is considerably stronger than TES2/CTAR2 interaction with TRADD , and interaction with TRADD is stronger than interaction with RIP .
RIP is associated with LMP1 in an EBV-transformed LCL .
RIP association with LMP1 was evaluated in an LCL transformed by an EBV recombinant that expresses F-LMP1I .
F-LMP1 was precipitated with antibody M2 , and coimmunopre-cipitated proteins were detected by Western immunoblotting ( Fig .
5 ) .
Another LCL transformed in parallel by a wild-type EBV that has an LMP1 gene without a Flag epitope served as a specificity control for the immunoprecipitation .
RIP , TRADD , and LMP1 levels were similar in the input lysates from the two LCLs .
F-LMP1 was highly enriched in the Flag antibody immunoprecipitate , whereas only a trace of LMP1 was nonspecifically immunoprecipitated by the Flag antibody .
After correction for the efficiency of F-LMP1 precipitation , approximately 8 % of TRADD and 4 % of RIP were stably associated with F-LMP1 .
Neither TRADD nor RIP was detected in the Flag antibody control immunoprecipitate from the cell line transformed with wild-type EBV .
RIP overexpression has an additive effect on LMP1-medi-ated NF-KB activation .
HEK293 cells were cotransfected with an LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 vector ( wild-type F-LMP1A or mutated F-LMP1AID ) , a TRADD or RIP vector , and a luciferase reporter with three NF- « B sites .
Consistent with the lower level of interaction with LMP1 in yeast and the lower level of association in LCLs , RIP did not synergize with LMP1 TES2/ CTAR2 in NF-kB activation .
While LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 activated NF-kB about 12-fold and RIP overexpression resulted in 7-fold NF-kB activation , cotransfection of LMP1 TES2/ CTAR2 with RIP resulted in 24-fold activation , marginally better than the 19-fold expected from a simple additive effect ( Fig .
6 ) .
By comparison , TRADD activated 10-fold and LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 cotransfected with TRADD activated 44-fold , substantially more than the 22-fold expected from an additive effect ( Fig .
6 ) .
ID-mutated LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 activated NF-kB similarly to vector alone , and cotransfection of ID-mutated LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 with RIP activated NF-kB 12-fold , marginally better than the eightfold expected from an LMP1 SIGNALS TRANSFORMATION THROUGH TRADD AND RIP - 5763 additive effect .
Similarly , ID-mutated LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 and TRADD cotransfection activated NF-kB 18-fold , marginally better than the 11-fold expected from an additive effect .
These data indicate that while TRADD synergizes with LMP1 TES/CTAR2 in NF- « B activation , RIP has only slightly more than an additive effect on LMP1 TES2/CTAR2-mediated NF-kB activation .
RIP is critical for TNFR1 but less critical for TES2/CTAR2-mediated NF-KB activation .
Selection of mutagenized Jurkat ( SVT35 ) T-lymphoma cells for mutants deficient in TNFR1-mediated NF-KB activation yielded a clone ( 35.3.13 ) that lacks RIP expression and in which TNFR1-mediated NF-kB activation can be restored by transfection with a RIP expression vector ( 54 ) .
These results point to a critical RIP function in TNFR1-mediated NF-kB activation .
Since TRADD is the proximal mediator of NF- « B activation from both TNFR1 and TES2/CTAR2 , RIP might be expected to be an effector of LMP1 TES2/CTAR2-mediated Surprisingly , transfection of increasing amounts of TES2/CTAR2 vector F-LMP1IA into SVT35 or 35.3.13 cells resulted in similar levels and parallel increases in NF-KB activation in both cell types ( Fig .
7 ) .
F-LMP1 ( both TES1/CTAR1 and TES2/CTAR2 ) was slightly more active overall than F-LMP1A but also was not different in NF-kB activation in SVT35 or 35.3.13 cells .
The 35.3.13 cells were confirmed to lack RIP and for TNF- « to be unable to activate NF-kB , whereas SVT35 cells were confirmed to express RIP and for TNF-a to activate NF-kB ( data not shown ) .
Thus , RIP is not an obligate intermediary for LMP1 TES2/ CTAR-mediated activation through TRADD .
LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 does not induce apoptosis in BJAB B-lymphoma or HEK293 cell lines , while TRADD induces apoptosis in both cell types .
TNF- « induces TNFR1 to recruit TRADD and then FADD , which mediates caspase 8 recruitment and initiation of apoptosis signaling ( reviewed in reference 1 ) .
LMP1 overexpression has been reported to induce apoptosis in RHEK cells ( 37 ) and to be toxic in BALB/c 3T3 , HEp-2 , 143/EBNA1 , and B-lymphoblast cells ( 18 ) , based on a 50 pe 1 $ 40-LL ] A T | £ E 30_ G _ 2 g 0320 ; 20 ] u .

LMP1 or LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 deleted for residues 187 to 351 activates NF-kB in RIP-positive SVT35 Jurkat cells and RIP-deficient 35.3.13 Jurkat cells .
Fifteen million SVT3S or 35.3.13 cells were electroporated with 9 ug of pSGS5 or the indicated amounts of F-LMP1 vector or TES2/CTAR2 vector F-LMP1A and with 1 pg of 3x- « B-L , an NF- « B-responsive luciferase reporter .
After 18 h , cultures were divided in two .
One-half was untreated , while the other half was stimulated with 200 nM phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and 10 nM ionomycin for 4 h , at which time both samples were tested and compared for luciferase activity .
The results are the means of relative light unit ( RLU ) emission from cells transfected with LMP1 vector divided by the RLU emission of cells further stimulated with PMA and ionomycin minus baseline values for pSG5 vector-transfected cultures .
In SVT35 ( RIP-positive ) cells , unstimulated and maximally activated luciferase activities were 2,800 and 109,000 RLU , respectively ( baseline 2.6 % of maximum ) , whereas in 35.3.13 ( RIP-negative ) cells , unstimulated and maximally activated luciferase activities were 7,800 and 111,000 RLU , respectively ( baseline 7.1 % of maximum ) .
Levels of F-LMP1 and F-LMP1A were monitored by Western immunoblotting and were equivalent at the same DNA dosage for both cell lines .
Further , RIP expression in SVT35 and deficiency in 35.3.13 was confirmed by Western immunoblotting ( data not shown ) .

To investigate whether these effects are due to TRADD-mediated apoptosis , BJAB B-lymphoma cells were transiently cotransfected with a GFP expression vector and either TRADD , LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 , ID-mutated LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 , or pSGS vector .
One hour after transfection , live cells were recovered by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque step gradient and cultured for 10 h. Each culture was then divided in two ; one-half was treated with cycloheximide to enhance apoptosis , and the other half was untreated .
Eight hours later , transfected cells were fixed , DNA was stained with propidium iodide , and the frequency of hypodiploid transfected cells was assessed by FACS analysis .
Approximately 50 % of the cells were GFP positive , and LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 expression did not affect GFP expression ( data not shown ) .
LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 and ID-mutated TES2/CTAR2 were expressed at similar levels as assessed by Western blotting ( data not shown ) .
The percentages of hypodiploid cells were between 8 and 13 % in LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 , ID-mutated LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 , or pSGS vector-transfected cells , while TRADD induced apoptosis in 45 % of the transfected cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
Cycloheximide treatment very slightly increased apoptosis in LMP1 TES2/ CTAR2 , ID-mutated LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 , or pSGS5 vector-transfected cells , while TRADD-mediated apoptosis was substantially enhanced ( data not shown ) .

Since BJAB cells have a high constitutive level of activated and NF- « B can have antiapoptotic effects , we examined whether LMP1 could cause apoptosis in cells that have low basal NF- « B activation .
We chose HEK293 cells since they are used to demonstrate TRADD-mediated apoptosis ( 22 ) and switched to peDNA3 as the vector for expression of LMP1 or LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 because of the increased activity of the cytomegalovirus promoter in HEK293 cells .
The constitutively expressed reporter pGK-B-galactosidase was used as a marker for transfected cells .
In this type of assay , apoptotic cells exhibit characteristic changes in cell morphology ( rounding up ) or detach from the substratum .
Transfection with LMP1 ( Fig .
9A , panel 3 ) or LMP1 CTAR2/TES2 ( panel 5 ) expression vectors did not markedly increase the percentage of B-galactosidase-positive cells scored as apoptotic compared with vector-transfected cells ( panel 1 ) .
TRADD vector transfection , in contrast , substantially increased the percentage of B-galac-tosidase-positive , apoptotic cells to 57 % ( panel 2 ) .
To eliminate the possibility that LMP1-induced NF- « B activation was protecting the cells from LMP1 TES2/CTAR2-TRADD-mediated apoptosis , a nondegradable form of IxBa with alanine substitutions for serines 32 and 36 ( IxBa SSAA [ 6 ] ) was coexpressed with an LMP1 or LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 vector .
Cells were also cotransfected with an NF- « B-responsive luciferase reporter to monitor the effect of IxBa SSAA on NF-kB activation .
NF-kB activation by LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 was completely inhibited by the coexpression of IxBa SSAA ( Fig .
9B ) .
However , apoptosis was not observed in either LMP1-or LMP1 TES2/CTAR2-expressing cells even with IxBa SSAA expression ( Fig .
9A , panels 4 and 6 ) .
IxBa SSAA expression had no effect on LMP1 or LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 expression ( Fig .

LMP1 and F-LMP1A do not activate apoptosis when NF- « B activation is blocked by the presence of a nondegradable IxBa ( IxBa SSAA ) .

CTAR2 is substantially different from TNFR1 in inducing apoptosis .
DISCUSSION These experiments indicate that TES2/CTAR2 signaling is similar but not identical to TNFR1 death domain signaling .
TES2/CTAR2 and TNFR1 directly interact with the TRADD death domain and stably associate with TRADD when their cytoplasmic tails are aggregated .
The six hydrophobic transmembrane domains of each LMP1 molecule mediate constitutive oligomeric aggregation in the plasma membrane ( Fig .
1 ) , whereas trimeric TNF- « ligand mediates trimerization of TNFR 1 in the plasma membrane ( 20-22 , 28 ) .
Both LMP1 and trimerized TNFR1 associate with TRADD , recruit TRAF , activate NIK and IxB kinases , phosphorylate IxB , and activate NF-kB ( 1 , 11 , 28 , 38 , 39 , 46 , 52 , 58 , 59 ) .
LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 and TNFR1 also share the ability to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase ( JNK/SAPK ) ( 14 , 34 , 35 ) .
The studies reported here also delineate differences between LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 and TNFR1 that advance our understanding of how LMP1 and TNFR1 alter cell growth and survival .
Eleven amino acids of LMP1 are sufficient for engaging the TRADD death domain to activate NF-kB , whereas the TNFR1 death domain that engages the TRADD death domain is about 70 residues ( 53 ) .
Further , while TRADD residues 296 to 299 or 300 to 302 are critical for TRADD interaction with itself or with TNFR1 as well as for NF- « B activation or for apoptosis ( 22 , 45 ) , these TRADD residues are not required for synergy with TES2/CTAR2 in NF-kB activation .
A mutant TRADD that is deleted for the C-terminal residues 294 to 312 and for most of the N-terminal TRAF interaction domain even had a partial dominant negative effect on TES2/CTAR2 mediated NF-kB activation .
Since the C-terminal residues of the TRADD are not required for LMP1 to synergize with TRADD in NF- « kB activation , this TRADD mutant likely binds to TES2/CTAR2 and fails to signal because of the absence of both a wild-type death domain and a wild-type TRAF recruitment domain .
The importance of TRADD residues 296 to 299 5766 IZUMI ET AL .
or 300 to 302 for TNFR1 interaction and for downstream effects and their lack of importance for TES2/CTAR2 signaling are consistent with a model in which the smaller TES2/CTAR2 domain interacts with part of the TRADD death domain and thereby propagates only a subset of the TNFR1 inducible TRADD effects .
While TNFR1 signaling through TRADD results in death domain-mediated recruitment of FADD and FADD -initiated apoptosis , LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 signaling through TRADD is deficient in induction of apoptosis .
Preliminary results from yeast two-hybrid analyses reveal a low-level LMP1 TES2/ CTAR2 association with FADD .
Further , F-LMP1 immu-noprecipitation from LCLs results in little or no specific coprecipitation of FADD ( 27 ) .
TNFR1-induced apoptosis is accentuated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cyclo-heximide , by expression of a nondegradable IxBa « , or by other interventions that inhibit NF-kB or JNK/SAPK pathways ( 3 , 48 , 55 , 57 ) .
Neither cycloheximide treatment nor inhibition of by expression of a nondegradable IxBa enabled LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 to cause apoptosis .
Thus , either LMP1 TES2/ CTAR2 is intrinsically unable to transmit a proapoptotic signal through TRADD or TES2/CTAR2 activates an antiapoptotic pathway that is independent of NF-kB or new protein synthe-sis .
LMP1 thus appears able to specifically signal through TRADD and separate NF-xB and JNK/SAPK activation from the induction of apoptosis .
Separation of TRADD-mediated effects has been previously described for a TRADD mutant that induces apoptosis but not NF-kB activation ( 45 ) .
Another difference between LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 and TNFR1 is the ability of TES2/CTAR2 to directly interact with another death domain containing protein the Fas receptor-interacting protein RIP ( 17 , 51 , 54 ) .
RIP interaction was diminished by the Y ; 5 , TES2/CTAR2 mutation that substantially diminishes TRADD interaction , NF-kB activation , and LCL outgrowth ( 28 ) .
Although TES2/CTAR2 associates with RIP at a lower level than TRADD and does not synergize with RIP in NF-kB activation , the RIP interaction is substantial and formally opens the possibility that RIP or another death domain protein is , in addition to TRADD , important in signaling from TES2/CTAR2 .
RIP is critical for TNFR1-mediated NF- « B activation in Jurkat cells and mouse fibroblasts ( 33 , 54 ) , and other roles are likely .
The RIP kinase domain has no known function , and RIP-deficient mice exhibit runting , neonatal lethality , and lymphoid defects that are not fully explained by defects in TNF- « signaling ( 33 ) .
In sum , the interaction of RIP with TES2/CTAR2 , the association of RIP with LMP1 in LCLs , the additive effect of RIP with LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 in NF-kB activation , and the strong negative effect of the YYD-to-ID mutation on these activities as well as on growth transformation are consistent with the possibility that RIP has a role in LMP1 signaling that mediates growth transformation .
A quite surprising aspect of the experiments reported here was the finding that LMP1 differs strikingly from TNFR 1 in not requiring RIP for NF-kB activation in Jurkat cells ( 33 , 54 ) .
LMP1 TES2/CTAR2 activates NF-kB as well in a RIP-deficient Jurkat cell line as in a wild-type Jurkat cell line .
The simplest model to explain this discrepancy is that RIP is a critical part of the TNFR1-TRADD signaling complex that activates NF-kB but is not an essential mediator of NF-kB activation downstream of TRADD .
In RIP-deficient cells , the TES2/CTAR2-TRADD complex activates NF-kB by recruitment of TRAFs to the TRADD N terminus , as evidenced by the dominant negative effect of a N-terminal TRAF2 deletion mutant on TES2/CTAR2-mediated NF-KB activation ( 28 ) .
These and previous experiments indicate that LMP1 uses Mor .

The LMP1 amino terminus and six transmembrane domains constitutively aggregate the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains independently of TNF- « ligand ( Fig .
1 ) .
TES1/CTAR1 associates with TRAF1 , -2 , -3 , and -5 , activates NF-kB , and contributes to initial resting B-lymphocyte growth transformation , while TES2/CTAR2 associates with TRADD and RIP , activates NF-kB and JNK/SAPK , and enables long-term lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth .
