4700-4704 , July 1988 Biochemistry Identification and purification of a human immunoglobulin-enhancer-binding protein ( NF- « B ) that activates transcription from a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter in vitro ( transcription factor /lymphoid-specific protein /UV crosslinking /DNase I `` footprinting '' /methylation interference ) KryosH1 KAWAKAMI , CLAUS SCHEIDEREIT , AND RoseRrt G. RoEDER Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , The Rockefeller University , New York , NY 10021 Communicated by James E. Darnell , Jr. , March 21 , 1988 ABSTRACT The enhancer-binding factor NF-B , which is found only in cells that transcribe immunoglobulin light chain genes , has been purified from nuclear extracts of Namalwa cells ( human Burkitt lymphoma cells ) by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography .
The purified NF- « B has been identified as a 51-kDa polypeptide by UV-crosslinking analysis .
`` *Footprint '' and methylation-interference analyses have shown that purified NF- « B has a binding activity specific for the x light chain enhancer sequence .
The purified factor activated in vitro transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type I promoter by binding to an upstream NF-KB-binding site .
The immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes are transcribed only in cells of the B lineage .
This results from tissue-specific gene rearrangements ( 1 ) and from the presence of tissue-specific promoters and tissue-specific enhancers ( reviewed in refs .
2-4 ) .
As found for many other promoters and enhancers ( 5 , 6 ) , those present in immunoglobulin genes each 'contain multiple elements that bind either common or tissue-specific factors ( reviewed in refs .
2-4 ) .
One of these sites in the « enhancer binds a factor called NF-KB ( 4 , 7 ) and is the single most critical element for lymphoid cell expression ( 8 ) .
The additional observation that an NF- « B binding activity is present in mature B cells and plasma cells but not in pre-B or T cells ( 4 ) suggested that NF- « B does play a regulatory role in B-cell-specific « transcription .
Consistent with this hypothesis NF- « B is induced in pre-B cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or phorbol ester in concert with the induction of x light chain gene transcription ( 3 , 7 ) .
Similarly , in HeLa or T-cell lymphoma cells phorbol ester simultaneously induces NF- « B binding and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription ( 9 , 10 ) .
An NF- « B-binding site exists not only in the x enhancer but also in the enhancers of simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) ( 11 ) , cyto-megalovirus ( 12 ) , HIV-1 ( 13 ) , and B , -microglobulin ( 14 ) .
Mutation of the NF- « B motif in the SV40 enhancer decreased the enhancer activity in B cells ( 15 ) .
These observations suggest that NF- « B is involved in regulating the transcription of many genes in addition to the x light chain genes .
To establish its role as a transcriptional activator and , ultimately , to analyze structure-function relationships , we have purified NF- « B from a mature B-cell line and tested its functional ( transcriptional ) activity on the HIV-1 promoter in vitro .

Oligonucleotides and Affinity Column .
A specific oligonucleotide that forms the recognition site for NF- « B and contains a 6-nucleotide 5'-end extension was prepared by annealing the following chemically synthesized oligonucleotides : A ( §-GGATCCTCAACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAG-GCCA-3 '' ) and B ( 5-GGATCCTGGCCTCGGAAAGTCCC-CTCTGTTGA-3 ' ) .
A mutant oligonucleotide that contains a 1-bp change ( bases in boldface letters ) in the recognition site for NF- « B was prepared from synthesized oligonucleotides : C ( 5-GGATCCTCAACAGAGGCGACTTTCCGAGGCCA-3 ' ) and D ( 5-GGATCCTGGCCTCGGAAAGTCGCCTCT-GTTGA-3 ' ) .
CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B ( Pharmacia ) was coupled with the double-stranded oligonucleotides as described by the manufacturer .
Approximately 0.25 mg of DNA was coupled per ml of matrix .
Purification of NF- « B .
The preparation of Namalwa-cell nuclear extracts and the chromatographic buffers BC and C , with dithiothreitol and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , were as described ( 19 ) .
NF- « B activity was monitored with the gel retardation assay by using an end-labeled Dde I-Sau3Al fragment ( positions 3886-3973 ) from the x enhancer ( 16 , 17 ) .
The first two steps of the purification were as described for octamer-binding transcription factor 2 , except that a typical purification involved 150 ml of Namalwa-cell nuclear extract ( 900 mg of protein , from 6 x 10 '' nuclei ) and slightly larger DEAE-cellulose ( 50 m ! )
and Bio-Rex 70 ( 80 ml , equilibrated with buffer BC/100 mM KCI ) columns .
Active fractions ( 170 mM-300 mM KCI ) from the Bio-Rex 70 column were pooled , dialyzed to 100 mM KCl , and loaded onto a 10-ml single-stranded DNA-agarose column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated in buffer BC/100 mM KCI/0.03 % Nonidet P-40 ( NP-40 ) , and NF- « B was eluted with a S5-column-volume gradient ( 100-800 mM KCI ) in the same buffer .
Active fractions ( 150 mM-350 mM KCI ) were pooled , dialyzed against buffer BC containing 0.05 % NP-40 to 100 mM KCI , and loaded onto a 0.6-ml specific-oligonucleotide-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer .
After washing with buffer BC/190 mM KCI1/0.05 % NP-40 , bound materials were eluted with buffer BC/350 mM KCI/0.05 % NP-40 .

Activity-containing fractions were combined and diluted with buffer BC/0.05 % NP-40 to a final concentration of 100 mM KCI .
After addition of herring testis DNA to 200 ug/ml , the solution was incubated at 0°C for 1 hr and then loaded onto a 0.6-ml specific-oligonucleotide-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer BC/100 mM KCI1/0.5 % NP-40/herring DNA ( 200 ug/ml ) .
The column was washed with buffer BC/190 mM KCI/0.05 % NP-40 , and NF-kB was eluted with buffer BC/350 mM KCI/0.05 % NP-40 .
The eluted material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C .
UV Crosslinking .
All the procedures were essentially as described by Wu et al .
( 20 ) .
The bromodeoxyuridine ( Brd-Urd ) -substituted oligonucleotide probe was prepared by annealing oligonucleotide A ( for the specific probe ) or C ( for the mutant probe ) with the complementary primer 5'-TGGCCTCGGA-3 ' and filling in with the Kienow fragment of DNA polymerase I , [ > P ] dATP , [ > P ] JdCTP , dGTP , and a 1:1 ratio of dTTP/BrdUrd .
One microliter of purified NF- « B fraction was incubated with BrdUrd-substituted probe in the presence of various competitors ( see Fig .
2 ) in 10 ul of gel-retardation-assay buffer ( 19 ) at 30°C for 15 min .
The samples were placed 5 cm from a UV lamp ( 1600 uW/cm , 260 nm ) and irradiated at 4°C for 30 min .
One microliter of a solution of 120 mM CaCl , and 24 mM MgCl ; and 1 ul of a mixture of DNase I and micrococcal nuclease [ 2.5 units/ul and 0.2 unit/ul , respectively , in 5 mM TrisHC ] ( pH 7.5 ) containing 50 mM NaCl , 35 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , bovine serum albumin ( 50 ng/ul1 ) , and 10 mM CaCl ; ] was added , and the complex was digested for 25 min at 30°C .
The reaction was terminated with 1 ul of 0.25 M EGTA .
After addition of 3 ul of 5x NaDodSO , sample buffer , the sample was boiled for 2 min , electrophoresed on a 10 % polyacrylamide/ NaDodSO , gel ( 21 ) , and subjected to autoradiography .
In Vitro Transcription .
Transcription reaction mixtures ( 30 pl ) contained 20 mM Hepes ( pH 8.4 ) , 70 mM KCI , 3 mM MgCl , , 0.6 mM ATP , 0.6 mM CTP , and 0.6 mM UTP , 0.03 mM [ °P ] JGTP ( 0.1 mCi/ml ; 1 Ci = 37 GBq ) , template DNA ( 50 ng ) , and 8.4 Ll of HeLa-cell nuclear extract ( ~60 ug of protein ) .
After incubating 1 hr at 30°C , run-off transcripts were analyzed on a denaturing 4.5 % polyacrylamide gel .
RESULTS Purification of Enhancer-Binding Protein NF- « B .
Our purification scheme involved six chromatographic steps .
These included passage through DE 52 at a high salt concentration ( to remove RNA and nucleoprotein complexes ) , chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 and on single-stranded DNA-agarose , and chromatography on specific-oligonucleotide columns ( 20 ) containing the « -enhancer NF- « B site [ in the absence or presence of nonspecific DNA ( 22 ) ] or a mutated NF-KB site ( which reduced NF- « B affinity by a factor of > 100 ) .
Omission of any one of the three oligonucleotide column steps resulted in several contaminating protein bands ( data not shown ) .
Fractions from the final column were assayed in the gel retardation assay and by NaDodSO , /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
In those fractions containing the DNA binding activity , two major bands of 68 kDa and 51 kDa were detected on polyacrylamide gels by Coomassie stain .
Within the sensitivity limits of this analysis , only the 51-kDa protein correlated in elution position with the DNA binding activity ( data not shown ) .
Silver staining of gels containing the peak fraction showed the same ( major ) 51-kDa and 68-kDa poly-peptides and only one additional band of any significance at Proc .

The overall purification and the yield of the specific DNA binding activity were ~4000-fold and 0.8 % , respectively .
Specificity of the Purified NF-B Binding Complexes .
In a gel retardation assay with the « light chain enhancer probe ( an 88-bp end-labeled Dde I-Sau3AI fragment ) , purified NF-kB formed four distinct complexes .
By using other probes such as the Dde I-Sau96l !
fragment ( positions 3886-4012 ) from the x enhancer or Xba I-Pvu II ( position -19 ) fragment of the HIV-1 promoter , similar complexes were formed ( data not shown ) .
The formation of these complexes designated C1 , C2 , and C3 ( a doublet ) , was inhibited by a specific oligonucleotide ( Fig .
1B , lanes 2 and 3 ) but not by an octamer-containing oligonucleotide ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , which readily inhibited the binding of a purified octamer-binding transcription factor to the octamer motif ( 19 ) .
A further analysis of the sites of interaction in complexes C1 , C2 , and C3 is presented below ( see Fig .
3 ) .
Identification of the NF- « B-Binding Protein by UV Crosslinking .
The co-elution of the 51-kDa protein band with the specific NF- « B-DNA binding activity ( above ) suggested that it was responsible for the site-specific ( NF- « B ) activity of the purified fraction .
To confirm this , we used the UV-crosslinking procedure that was employed by Wu et al .
( 20 ) to identify a purified Drosophila heat shock activator protein .
The photoaffinity labeling probe was prepared from specific oligonucleotide A or mutant oligonucleotide C. BrdUrd substitution did not change the specific binding activity as measured in the gel retardation assay ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
2 , after binding , UV crosslinking , nuclease digestion , and NaDodSO , /polyacrylamide gel electrophore-sis , the 51-kDa protein was labeled by °°P transfer from the specific oligonucleotide ( lane 2 ) .
Controls with the [ °P ] BrdUrd-labeled mutant-oligonucleotide probe showed no labeled band ( lanes 8-10 ) .

The purified NF- « B fraction ( 1 wl ) was incubated with probe in the absence of competitor ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of an NF- « B-sequence-containing oligonucleotide ( lanes 2 and 3 ) or an octamer-sequence-containing oligonucleotide ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Oligonucleotides were added at a 50-fold ( lanes 2 and 4 ) or 20-fold ( lanes 3 and 5 ) molar excess relative to the probe .

experiments an unlabeled specific oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) and a k-enhancer fragment containing the NF- « B-binding sequence ( lane 5 ) abolished the signal , whereas neither the mutant oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) nor pUC19 DNA ( lane 6 ) did so .
Omission of purified NF- « B protein from the reaction mixture also failed to produce any signal ( lane 1 ) .
Omission of the DNase treatment resulted in a labeled band remaining at the position of a 60-kDa protein ( lane 7 ) , suggesting that the undigested 32-bp probe remained covalently attached to the 51-kDa protein .
Interactions of Purified NF- « B with the x Enhancer .
DNase I footprinting and methylation-interference experiments were performed on the C1 , C2 , and C3 complexes .
As shown in the DNase-footprint analysis of Fig .
34 , 9 nucleotides of the upper strand and 13 nucleotides of the lower strand were protected .
To identify the guanine contacts in this protected region the methylation-interference analysis was performed .
Methylation of six of the guanines ( marked with arrows ) in the NF- « B-binding sequence interfered with the complex formation ( Fig .
3B , lanes C1 and C2 ) .
Corresponding cleavage enhancement at the positions of these six guanines was observed in the free probe ( lane F ) .
These observed enhancements ( in the free probe pool ) with probes methylated at these positions were expected since only =~40 % of the probe was uncomplexed in this experiment .
The methylation interference and DNase protection results are summarized in Fig .

DNase I footprinting and methylation-interference analyses of purified NF- « B binding to the x enhancer .
( A ) DNase I footprints were generated with a 5'-labeled ( lower strand ) or a 3'-labeled ( upper strand ) Dde I-Sau9 % 6l fragment ( positions 3886-4012 ) of the x enhancer .
The 80-4l binding reaction mixtures ( 19 ) contained 40 fmol of probe and 5 ul of purified NF- « B , but no poly [ d ( I-C ) -d ( I-C ) ] .
After 30 min at 30°C , 16 pl of DNase I ( 1 ug/ml ! )
in 18 mM MgCl , and 1 mM CaCl , was added and incubated 40 sec at 25°C .
Reactions were stopped with 1 ul of 0.5 M EDTA and the samples were analyzed on nondenaturing gels ( 19 ) .
Bands corresponding to the unretarded probe ( F ) and to the C1 , C2 , and C3 complexes ( Fig .

template for in vitro transcription .
These NF- « B-binding sites are responsible for inducibility of transcription in T cells treated with phorbol esters ( 9 ) .
We have tested two kinds of deletion mutants .
pU3R/-121 contains HIV-1 sequence extending from position -121 to position +80 and includes the entire promoter/enhancer region .
pU3R/-57 contains sequence from position -57 to position +80 and lacks the two NF- « B-binding sites ( from position -105 to position -82 ) ( see Fig .
5C and ref .
13 ) .
When transcribed in HeLa extracts both templates generated 332-nucleotide run-off transcripts corresponding to specific initiation at the in vivo cap site ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1 and 4 ) .
This was expected since these templates contain a `` TATA box* '' and functional SP1 site ( 10 , 24 ) .
Addition of affinity-purified ( step 6 ) NF- « B stimulated transcription from the - 121 template ~3-fold ( quantitated by densitometry of the x-ray film ) ( lanes 1-3 ) but had no effect on transcription from the -57 template ( lanes 4-6 ) .
These results indicate that purified NF- « B activated transcription from the HIV-1 promoter through the interaction with the NF- « B-binding sites rather than in a nonspecific manner .
To confirm the idea , we analyzed the binding of the purified NF- « B to the HIV-1 promoter .
Interaction of Purified NF-B with the HIV-1 Enhancer Sites .
Gel retardation assays with an HIV-1 enhancer probe and purified NF- « B revealed complexes ( C1 , C2 , and C3 ) analogous to those formed with the xk enhancer ( data not shown ) .
Of the two putative NF- « B-binding sites in HIV-1 ( 9 ) , only the distal binding site ( positions -103 to -~96 ) was protected from DNase I treatment in these complexes ( Fig .
5A ) .
Decreased signals indicative of methylation interference were not clearly observed in complexed probes ( Fig .
5B , lanes C1 and C2 ) , but enhanced methylation was seen in the free probe ( lane F , see above ) , suggesting at least a partial interference of binding when one of these six guanine residues was methylated [ ~25 % of the probe was in the free ( uncomplexed ) form in this experiment ] ( Fig .
5C ) .
DISCUSSION To understand the developmental signals that lead to the commitment and differentiation of lymphoid cells , we have undertaken the identification and characterization of cell-type-specific factors that regulate expression of the well-characterized immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes .
These genes contain tissue-specific promoter and enhancer elements , and factors interacting with these elements have -121 -57 == -- - ++ -+ + NF-KB 1 2 3 4 5 6 Fig .

been identified by DNA-binding assays ( reviewed in ref .
19 ) .
We have purified and characterized a B-cell-specific factor ( octamer-binding transcription factor 2 ) that interacts with a sequence ( octamer ) present in heavy and light chain promoters and in the heavy chain enhancer and is presumed to play a major role in the tissue-specific function of these elements ( reviewed in ref .
19 ) .
Such a role was demonstrated for the k promoter , which was activated by the purified protein in vitro ( 19 ) .
For the « k enhancer , the main determinant for tissue-specific function is an element for which a tissue-specific binding activity ( designated NF- « B ) has been reported ( 4 , 8 ) .
Here we describe the purification of NF- « B by affinity chromatography with an immobilized oligonucleotide containing the k-enhancer NF- « B recognition sequence .
The final preparation contained a predominant 51-kDa polypep-tide ( s ) that was shown by UV crosslinking to contain the site-specific binding activity and that formed two major complexes in gel retardation assays .
These probably resulted from heterogeneity in the purified protein , since a doublet was observed in NaDodSO , gels by direct analysis and after UV crosslinking .
The molecular basis and possible biological significance of this heterogeneity remains to be demon-strated , but similar observations have been made for other transcription factors such as the CCAAT-binding transcription factor ( 25 ) and the B-cell-specific octamer-binding transcription factor 2 ( 19 ) .
Purified NF- « B also formed two minor , more rapidly migrating complexes in the gel retarda- 4704 Biochemistry : Kawakami et al .
tion assay , which may contain degradation products .
All of these complexes showed the same binding specificity .
NF- « B binding to the x enhancer was analyzed in more detail by DNase-protection and methylation-interference assays , which revealed binding over an ~=13-bp region containing the sequence GGGACTTTCC ( Fig .
3C ) .
Of special note is the fact that the methylation-interference pattern was identical to that reported for the major NF- « B binding activity in crude nuclear extracts ( or fractions ) ( 4 ) .
This strongly indicates that the protein purified was the B-cell-specific factor responsible for this activity and not a ubiquitous factor ( H2TF1 or KBF1 ) observed by others to interact ( through contacts with all guanine residues ) with a related sequence ( GGGGATTCCCC ) in the H-2K '' enhancer ( 26 , 27 ) .
This conclusion is supported by our failure to detect the NF- « B binding activity in HeLa cells ( cf .
ref .
4 ) and by binding studies ( below ) on the HIV-1 enhancer .
The ubiquitous factor recognizing H-2K '' promoter elements has been purified and identified as a 48-kDa protein ( 28 ) .
Interactions of purified NF- « B with the HIV promoter were restricted to one of the two potential NF- « B-binding sites ( Fig .
5C ) .
It was shown ( 9 ) that one ( or both ) of these sites mediated the phorbol ester-induced transcription of the HIV promoter in a T-cell line ( Jurkat ) and that this was accompanied by the induction of an activity ( presumably NF- « B ) that bound to one ( or both ) of these sites and to the x enhancer .
Selective binding of purified NF- « B to the distal site is surprising in view of the identity of the two sites with each other and with the x enhancer site but may reflect a steric problem resulting from the close proximity of the sites .
Using crude extracts from HeLa cells , others ( 29 ) have observed interactions of a cellular factor ( s ) with the proximal ( but not the distal ) element , whereas extracts from lymphoid or phorbol ester-treated cells showed additional interactions with the distal element ( ref .
30 , see also ref .
10 ) .
Thus it appears that the distal element can be occupied only by NF- « B , whereas the proximal site could , in principle , be occupied either by a common cellular factor ( possibly the H2TFI factor discussed above ) or by NF- « B .
Although our observations with purified NF- « B favor the hypothesis that the proximal site can be occupied only by a factor other than NF-kB , we can not exclude the possibility that one of the other HIV-1 promoter recognition factors ( e.g. , SP1 ; ref .
24 ) might stabilize interactions of NF-KB at this site ( cf .
refs .

Binding and functional studies ( see below ) with purified factors , including NF- « B , H2TF1 , SP1 , and the TATA factor transcription factor IID ( 31 ) , will be required to resolve the mechanisms involved in HIV-1 promoter activa-tion .
The correlations mentioned above between levels of NF- « B binding activity and levels of « or HIV-1 transcription strongly suggest that NF- « B serves as a transcription factor for these genes .
We have provided direct proof for this supposition by showing that the purified NF- « B stimulates transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in HeLa extracts and that this stimulation is specific for templates containing NF- « B-binding sites .
The observed level of transcriptional stimulation ( 3-fold ) was not as great as that observed for the induction of HIV-1 in T cells by a combination of phorbol ester and phytohemagglutinin ( 9 ) .
However , even without optimization of the in vitro conditions , the level of stimulation approximated the level of induction ( 3- to 4-fold ) of HIV-1 transcription by phorbol ester alone in intact HeLa cells ( 30 ) or in derived extracts ( 10 ) .
Thus , apart from implicating NF-KB as a true transcription factor , the present data indicate that the 51-kDa form of NF- « B is functional .
These studies represent an important step in studying the structure , func-tion , and regulation of a factor important not only for Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 85 ( 1988 ) immunoglobulin regulation in B cells but also for HIV-1 promoter regulation in T cells .
Note Added in Proof : In direct footprint analysis , both of the NF- « B binding sites in HIV promoter were protected from DNase I treatment by the purified NF- « B .
