11 Nonopsonic Phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Macrophages and Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes Requires the Presence of the Bacterial Flagellum ESHWAR MAHENTHIRALINGAM'* anp DAVID P. SPEERT* Division of Infectious and Immunological Diseases , Department of Paediatrics and the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network , '' and Department of Microbiology and Immunology , '' University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada Received 2 June 1995/Returned for modification 11 July 1995/Accepted 28 August 1995 Whereas the mechanism of nonopsonic phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been described , the bacterial ligands required are poorly understood .
To identify the requisite bacterial ligands , studies with isogenic mutants of P. aeruginosa PAK lacking pili , flagella , and the RpoN sigma factor were undertaken .
The RpoN mutant , lacking pili , flagella , and nonpilus adhesins , bound poorly and was resistant to ingestion by both macrophages and neutrophils .
Pili were not absolutely required for binding or phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa .
The presence of a flagellum was not required for binding of P. aeruginosa to macrophages but was critical for the subsequent internalization of the bacterium , suggesting that this factor or a surface ligand associated with its assembly was responsible for stimulation of nonopsonic phagocytosis .
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant cause of lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) .
Several P. geruginosa virulence factors that may contribute to pathogenesis during initial colonization of the respiratory tract and subsequent persistence during chronic infection have been characterized ( 10 ) .
However , the specific factors that may interfere with the phagocytic clearance of P. aeruginosa from the CF lung remain poorly understood .
The initial interaction of pulmonary phagocytic cells and infecting bacteria probably occurs in the absence of serum opsonins , and work in this laboratory has focused on the mechanism of nonopsonic phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa ( 4 , 11-13 ) .
Once infection has been established , the inflammatory process creates an environment which likely interferes with the clearance of P. aeruginosa .
Cleavage of complement and phagocytic receptors by bacterial and inflammatory proteases may lead to a receptor-ligand mismatch , reducing the efficiency of opsonophagocytosis ( 14 ) , and subsequent growth of P. aeruginosa as mucoid microcolonies may enable it to evade phagocytic clearance ( 1 ) .
Despite the presence of opsonizing antibody in patients with CF , P. aeruginosa converts to a serum-sensitive phenotype and is able to persist in the lung during chronic colonization , suggesting that op-sonophagocytic clearance and complement-mediated lysis are defective ( 10 ) .
Recently , we demonstrated that P. aeruginosa isolates collected from chronically colonized CF patients are frequently nonmotile ; they lack the surface factors flagella , pili , and nonpilus adhesins which are under the control of the alternative sigma factor , RpoN ( 4 ) .
These studies showed that wild-type CF isolates , lacking a flagellum , are resistant to nonopsonic phagocytosis , while those lacking pili but retaining their motility are susceptible to ingestion ( 4 ) .
P. ceruginose CF isolates lacking both a flagellum and pili and having phenotypes similar to those of P. aeruginosa RpoN mutants ( 15 ) are completely resistant to ingestion .
We suggested that the loss of these * Corresponding author .

4519 surface features during chronic colonization of patients with CF may be a mechanism of bacterial persistence ( 4 ) .
The current study was undertaken to formally assess the role of each of these RpoN-dependent surface factors in nonopsonic phagocytosis .
Although previous studies have assessed the role of P. aeruginosa pili , flagella , and nonpilus adhesins in susceptibility to phagocytosis by macrophages ( 3 , 5 ) not one of these studies ( i ) was able to differentiate between bound and ingested bacteria , ( ii ) used mutants that were all derived from the same parental isolate , ( iii ) facilitated contact between nonmotile bacteria and macrophages by centrifugation , or ( iv ) examined the nonopsonic phagocytosis by neutrophils of these P. aeruginosa isogenic mutants .
Using methods developed in this laboratory , we have extended previous studies and examined the role of individual surface ligands in binding and ingestion of P. aeruginosa by phagocytes in the absence of serum opsonins .
Interaction of P. aeruginosa PAK isogenic mutants with murine macrophages .
To determine which bacterial surface factors mediate binding by macrophages in the absence of serum opsonins , P. aeruginosa PAK and its isogenic mutants were tested in a nonopsonic mouse macrophage ingestion assay ( 4 , 12 ) .
The isogenic mutants of P. ceruginose PAK used in this study were obtained from Stephen Lory , University of Wash-ington , Seattle , and their genotypic and phenotypic features are summarized in Table 1 .
P. aeruginosa P1 , a nonmucoid derivative of a mucoid CF strain ( Table 1 ) , was included in all phagocytic assays as a control .
Macrophages were harvested from the peritoneal cavities of female BALB/c mice 3 days after elicitation by thioglycolate injection and prepared for phagocytic assay exactly as previously described ( 4 ) .
P. aeruginosa ( approximately 2 X 10 '' viable bacteria ) was added to adherent macrophages ( 10° ; an infection ratio of 200 bacteria per macrophage ) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C .
The monolayers were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , fixed with methanol , and stained with Giemsa , and the number of bacteria associated with each macrophage was determined by light microscopy ( 4 ) .
The mean * standard error of the mean ( SEM ) and Student 's ¢ test for independent means were used to assess differences in the interaction with phagocytes of 4520 NOTES INFECT .

To facilitate bac-terium-to-macrophage contact of nonmotile P. seruginosa , bacteria were centrifuged ( 2,000 x g for 10 min ) onto the macrophage monolayers prior to the ingestion assay .
The levels of binding of the PAK mutants under normal and centrifuged conditions are shown in Fig .
1A .
Both the P. aeruginosa PI control and the PAK parental strain bound well to macrophages under normal conditions ; forced contact increased the binding of strain P1 marginally and did not alter the binding of strain PAK ( Fig .
1A ) .
Under normal conditions , all the isogenic mutants bound to macrophages significantly less than the parental strain .
The absence of surface pili reduced the binding of PAK by approximately 55 % , and the lack of the flagellum reduced binding of strain PAK by 84 % .
Centrifugation of the pilin and flagellin mutants onto the macrophage monolayers increased binding to approximately 80 % of that of the parental strain .
The RpoN mutant , lacking flagella , pili , and nonpilus adhesins , associated very poorly with macrophages , and binding was only slightly increased by centrifugation ( Fig .
1A ) .
Binding of P. aeruginosa PAK to macrophage monolayers in the absence of opsonins appeared to require motility for optimal binding and may occur via pilus and nonpilus adhesins .

Strain PAK was ingested substantially less than strain P1 .
All the isogenic mutants of strain PAK were phagocytosed significantly less than the parental isolate under both normal and centrifuged conditions ( Fig .

Ingestion of strain PAK was dependent on the presence of pili ; the pilin mutant was ingested at 30 % of the control rate ( Fig .

The flagellin mutant was resistant to nonopsonic ingestion ; phagocytosis was only slightly increased by forced contact with the monolayer .
The RpoN mutant was absolutely resistant to nonopsonic ingestion , and this resistance was not overcome with centrifugation of the bacteria onto the macrophage monolayer .
Ingestion of P. geruginosa PAK by macrophages in the absence of serum opsonins , although heavily dependent on the presence of pili , appeared to also require both the bacterial flagellum and other RpoN-dependent fac-tors .
Because the mutants used in this study were constructed by insertion of antibiotic resistance cassettes into structural genes encoding the RpoN-dependent surface factors ( Table 1 ) , complementation with the wild-type gene was carried out for the flagellin and the RpoN mutants in order to assess whether restoration of phagocytic potential was possible .

The phagocytic assays were carried out without centrifugally forcing bacteria onto the macrophage monolayers .
Mobilization of plasmid pPT244 , carrying the 2C gene ( 16 ) , into the flagellin mutant restored expression of the flagellum and also increased the phagocytic susceptibility of this mutant to approximately 50 % that of wild-type PAK ( Table 2 ) ( the vector control remained resistant to nonopsonic ingestion ) .
Complementation of the RpoN mutant with plasmid pPT212 , encoding the rpoN gene ( 15 ) , only partially restored the phenotype of PAK-NI , with few motile bacteria visible by light microscopy ( data not shown ) .
The degree of phagocytosis of the complemented PAK RpoN mutant was only slightly increased and remained well below that of the wild-type PAK ( Table 2 ) ( PAK-NI carrying the vector alone was resistant to phagocytosis ) .
Partial complementation of phenotype has been previously observed with `` RpoN-mutant-like '' isolates from CF infection ( 4 ) and also with P. aeruginosa PAK-NI ( 3a ) and may result from the complex nature of regulatory events associated with sigma factor .

The interaction of P. aeruginosa isogenic mutants lacking RpoN-dependent surface factors with human phagocytic cells has not been examined .
Therefore , evaluation of nonopsonic phagocytosis of P. geruginosa PAK and its isogenic mutants was also carried out with human monocyte-derived macrophages ( Md ) and neutrophils ( PMNs ) to provide a comparison with the data obtained with murine macrophages .
Monocytes , harvested from the heparinized venous blood of healthy adult volunteers , were cultured in Teflon beakers for 6 days as described previously ( 13 ) .
Approximately 5 x 10 '' Mé were used in each phagocytic assay , and phagocytosis was performed as described previously ( 13 ) .
Bacterial ingestion was assessed as described above for murine macrophages , except that the lysozyme-water wash was omitted ( because it detached the human macrophages from the monolayer ) ; all cell-associ-ated bacteria were therefore counted .
Because fewer Mo were used than in the murine phagocytic assay , the infection ratio of bacteria to macrophages was considerably higher , approximately 400 to 1 .
Human Mo appeared to interact with the same P. aeruginosa ligands as the murine macrophages ( Fig .
2A ) .
As with the murine macrophages , the RpoN~ and Fla~ strains associated with human Mo less than the parental strain ( Fig .
2A ) , indicating the importance of motility in the adhesion process ( the bacteria were not spun onto the human Md mono-layers ) .
The Pil~ strain associated with the human monolayers well ( 75 % of control [ Fig .
2A ) ) , suggesting that nonopsonic phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa PAK by human macrophages is not fully dependent on the presence of this ligand .
Over-all , these data suggest that similar receptor-ligand interactions occur between either human or murine macrophages and P. aeruginosa .
Human neutrophils were isolated and purified by density gradient centrifugation as described previously ( 7 ) .

4522 NOTES ml in Hanks balanced salt solution ( GIBCO-BRL , Gaithers-burg , Md . )
containing 0.1 % gelatin ( gHBSS ) , and 450-pJ ali-quots ( 2 x 10° cells ) were dispensed into 5-ml sterile plastic tubes .
After 30 min of incubation at 37°C with end-over-end tumbling , approximately 3 X 10 '' bacteria ( an infection ratio of approximately 140 bacteria per neutrophil ) were added and the incubation was continued for 1 h. The cells were then diluted with 2.5 ml of gHBSS , and the neutrophils were collected by gentle centrifugation at 200 x g for 10 min at room temperature .
After resuspension in 1 ml of gHBSS , 100 wl of the suspension was deposited onto a glass slide by cytocentrifu-gation ( Cytospin 2 ; Shandon Southern Products Ltd. , Astmoor , England ) .
The slides were stained with 3 % Giemsa , and phagocytosis was assessed by light microscopy as described above ( ingested bacteria inside phagosomes were clearly visible after cytocentrifugation ) .
Nonopsonic interaction of the PAK mutants with human PMNs mimicked that of the murine macrophages .
All isogenic mutants were ingested to a significantly lesser extent than the parental strain .
Phagocytosis was dependent on the presence of both pili and flagella , and the RpoN mutant was almost completely resistant to uptake ( Fig .
2B ) .
The lack of ingestion by PMN of the PAK Fla~ mutant was probably not due to reduced bacterium-phagocyte contact associated with the absence of bacterial motility ; the PMN phagocytic assay was performed in a small volume of medium with end-over-end mixing of the contents , and these conditions are expected to promote contact between bacteria and phagocytes .
Resistance to ingestion of the flagellin mutant in the neutrophil assay and in the forced-contact murine macrophage assay suggests a critical role for the flagellum in the nonopsonic binding and uptake of P. aeruginosa by phagocytes .
Partial restoration of phagocytic susceptibility was achieved when the flagellin mutant was complemented with the wild-type gene , confirming the role of the flagellum in nonopsonic ingestion .
Insertional inactivation of flagellin expression may have considerable polar effects since the gene is part of a regulatory hierarchy of genes required for synthesis of the flagellum and motility in P. aeruginosa .
Therefore the moiety responsible for stimulation of nonopsonic phagocytosis may be a factor associated with synthesis of the flagellum structure which is not expressed if flagellin is not secreted .
The role of pili in the nonopsonic uptake of P. aeruginosa by macrophages has been demonstrated in several studies ( 3 , 5 , 13 ) , although not one of these studies distinguished between the binding and subsequent ingestion events ( as we have with the lysozyme washing procedure ) .
Kelly et al .
( 3 ) used a pilus-deficient pilA : :Tn501 mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to demonstrate that fibronectin-stimulated nonopsonic phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by a macrophage-like murine cell line was a pilus-mediated event .
However , the studies we report here suggest that nonopsonic phagocytosis is a very complex process requiring bacterial pili , nonpilus adhesins , and flagella , the latter being necessary for internalization .
Mork and Hancock ( 5 ) , utilizing the fibronectin-stimulated phagocytic assay ( 3 ) , demonstrated that a spontaneous flagellum-deficient mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was able to bind to macrophages ; they were unable to show that this binding led to subsequent uptake of the bacterium .
Earlier studies from our laboratory , utilizing P. aeruginosa CF isolates , indicated that association of the bacterium with phagocytes in the absence of serum opsonins was correlated with the presence of pili and the ability of the organism to form a surface pellicle when grown in static broth ( 13 ) ; the present study also correlates susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to nonopsonic phagocytosis with pellicle formation , a phenotypic feature of motile isolates ( Table 1 ) .
Our study INFECT .
ImnmMUN .
indicates that the flagellum not only is required to mediate adequate contact for binding to macrophages but also has a role in stimulating the ingestion of P. aeruginosa by murine macrophages .
Flagellum-mediated motility has been shown to play a role in the adherence of P. geruginosa to respiratory epithelia in vitro ( 8 , 9 ) ; those studies did not , however , demonstrate a specific binding interaction between the flagellum and respira-tory-cell surfaces .
Similarly , our study suggests that bacterial motility is required for efficient binding of P. aeruginosa to phagocytes by pilus and nonpilus adhesins .
However , forcing contact between bacteria and macrophages suggested that motility was necessary but not sufficient for ingestion to occur and that the flagellum is also required for internalization of P. aeruginosa .
Preston and King ( 6 ) demonstrated flagellum-dependent binding and endocytosis of soil pseudomonads by soil amoebas .
Recently , Yao et al .
( 17 ) , using insertional mutants , demonstrated that adherence and invasion of eukaryotic cells by Campylobacter jejuni was dependent on the presence of the flagellum .
A role for the flagellum in specific binding and penetration of cell surfaces is therefore not unprecedented , and the flagellum-dependent internalization of P. aeruginosa warrants further investigation .
In conclusion , we have demonstrated that RpoN-dependent surface components of P. aeruginosa play a major role in mediating the nonopsonic phagocytosis of the organism by both macrophages and neutrophils .
Although pilus and nonpilus adhesins and bacterial motility were required for binding of P. aeruginosa to phagocytic cells , the bacterial flagellum was required to trigger phagocytic internalization .
We believe that the persistence of P. aeruginosa during chronic CF lung infection involves several phenotypic alterations that may enable the organism to evade phagocytic clearance ; these include up-regulation of the expression of mucoid exopolysaccharide and the loss of expression of RpoN-dependent surface ligands ( pili and flagella ) .
