In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for CD28-mediated activation of the NF-xB/CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 expression .
Delineation of the CD28 signaling cascade was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity , followed by the activation of phospholipase A ; and S-lipoxygenase .
Our data suggest that lipoxygenase metabolites activate ROI formation which then induce IL-2 expression via NF- « B activation .
These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the CD28 costimulatory pathway .
Keywords : CD28/costimulation/IL-2/NF- « xB/ROI Introduction T lymphocytes require distinct signals from antigen-presenting cells for activation ( reviewed by Mueller et al. , 1989 ; Jenkins and Johnson , 1993 ; Crabtree and Clipstone , 1994 ) .
An antigen-specific stimulus is delivered through the T cell receptor ( TCR ) following the binding of TCR to antigenic peptides presented by MHC molecules .
However , while engagement of the TCR triggers the initial steps of T cell activation , TCR stimulation is not sufficient to ensure a full immune response .
Complete T cell activation requires a second costimulatory signal , since TCR signaling in the absence of an accessory cell-derived costimulus leads to anergy and a long-lasting state of unresponsiveness to antigenic stimulation ( Harding et al. , 1992 ; Crabtree and Clipstone , 1994 ) .
TCR stimulation in the absence of costimulatory signals may also lead to cell death in previously activated T cells ( Punt et al. , 1994 ) .
An important costimulus which can reverse induction of anergy and programmed cell death is the CD28 surface receptor that is expressed on the majority of thymocytes and peripheral T lymphocytes ( reviewed by Linsley and Ledbetter , 1993 ; June et al. , 1994 ) .
CD28 is a homodimeric molecule composed of two 44 kDa subunits .
Its predicted © Oxford University Press sequence is that of a receptor of the Ig superfamily with a single Vy-like domain in the extracellular part , a transmembrane region and a short intracellular domain ( Aruffo and Seed , 1987 ) .
The counter-receptor for CD28 is B7 which is expressed on activated B cells , dendritic cells and macrophages ( reviewed by June et al. , 1994 ) .
At least two forms of B7 ( B7-1/CD80 and B7-2/B70 ) exist and both are members of the Ig superfamily .
B7 also binds to CTLA-4 , a receptor that is structurally related to CD28 and expressed in low copy number following T cell activation ( Linsley et al. , 1991 ) .
Triggering of the CD28 receptor in conjunction with stimulation of the TCR-CD3 complex strongly enhances T cell proliferation and T cell cytotoxic activity ( reviewed by June et al. , 1990 ) .
A major effect of the CD28 costimulus consists of the enhanced production of cyto-kines , such as IL-2 , IFN-y , GM-CSF , TNF and others , which are upregulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes ( Martin et al. , 1986 ; Guba et al. , 1989 ; Thompson et al. , 1989 ; Cerdan et al. , 1991 , 1992 ) .
It has been observed that CD28 stimulation leads to the coordinate stabilization of the mRNAs for these cytokines ( Lindsten et al. , 1989 ) .
In addition to these post-transcriptional events , IL-2 mRNA levels are increased due to enhanced transcriptional activity .
Studies on the IL-2 promoter have identified a CD28-responsive element ( CD28RE ) with enhancer activity ( Fraser et al. , 1991 ; Verweij et al. , 1991 ) .
The nucleotide sequence of CD28RE is structurally related to the classical xB consensus sequence and was found to bind a CD28-responsive complex ( CD28RC ) consisting of protein subunits of the NF-xB family ( Verweij et al. , 1991 ; Costello et al. , 1993 ) .
In accordance , stimulation of CD28 in lymphocytes pretreated with anti-CD3 or phorbolesters results in increased nuclear amounts of the NF-xB proteins p50 , p65 and c-Rel ( Ghosh et al. , 1993 ) .
In Jurkat T cells , it has been further observed that CD28 activates JNK , a protein kinase involved in post-transcriptional activation of AP-1 , which is known to bind to the IL-2 gene enhancer ( Su et al. , 1994 ) .
Relatively little is known about the early signaling pathway triggered by CD28 .
A hallmark of the CD28 costimulus is its refractoriness to the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 ( June et al. , 1987 ; Bjorndahl et al. , 1989 ; van Lier et al. , 1991 ) .
Consequently , signals associated with TCR activation , such as a rise in cytosolic free calcium , formation of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , are typically not observed in response to B7 or agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies .
Recently , CD28 stimulation has been observed to lead to the rapid appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins , including the CD28 molecule itself ( Lu et al. , 1992 ; Vandenberghe et al. , 1992 ; Hutchroft and Bierer , 1994 ; Nunés et al. , 1994 ) .

Characterization of the CD28 costimulus in purified T lymphocytes .
( A ) Effects on IL-2 secretion .
Cells ( 1x 10° cells/ml ) were stimulated for 48 h in the presence of saturating concentrations of either anti-CD28 , anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 + anti-CD3 or left unstimulated ( control ) .
Supernatants were assayed for IL-2 using an ELISA system .
Results are given in IU/ml + SD using an IL-2 standard .
( B ) Effect of CD28 stimulation on the activation of CD28RC .
Cells were stimulated with the indicated reagents and extracts were prepared after 2 h. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with the P-labeled CD28RE oligonucleotide and analyzed by EMSA on a native polyacrylamide gel .
The arrowhead indicates the position of the CD28RE-specific complex .
( C ) Competition analysis .
Reaction mixtures containing extracts of anti-CD28 + anti-CD3-stimulated cells were incubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled CD28RE ( lane 2 ) , a xB-specific oligonucleotide from the mouse K light chain enhancer ( lane 3 ) , an unrelated oligonucleotide containing the SP1-binding site ( lane 4 ) or an oligonucleotide with a mutated CD28RE ( lane 5 ) .
A section of the fluorogram is shown .
( D ) Analysis of CD28RC subunit composition .
Reaction mixtures of an extract from anti-CD28 + anti-CD3-stimulated cells were incubated in the absence ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of antibodies raised against the indicated NF-KB subunits ( lanes 2-4 ) .
Lane 5 shows the results with an unrelated rabbit IgG antibody .
A section of the fluorogram is shown .
of IL-2 production and cell proliferation was prevented by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A , suggesting that early signaling steps are controlled by still unknown protein kinases .
In addition , following tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 , formation of a complex with phos-phatidylinositol-3-kinase has been observed which binds to a Tyr-Met-X-Met motif in the intracellular part of CD28 ( Pagés et al. , 1994 ; Prasad et al. , 1994 ; Truitt et al. , 1994 ) .
However , it is presently unknown whether 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides , the products of this lipid kinase , represent signaling molecules of the CD28 pathway ( Lu et al. , 1995 ) .
Other messenger systems , such as a rise in cGMP ( Ledbetter et al. , 1986 ) or phosphoinositol levels ( Ledbetter et al. , 1990 ; Nunés et al. , 1993 ) , appear to be affected by the degree of crosslinking of the CD28 receptor , but it is unlikely that these molecules are essentially required for the costimulatory pathway involving IL-2 secretion .
Furthermore , most studies on CD28 signaling have been performed in T lymphoma cell lines .
Transformed cells , however , may be poor models , because they have been selected to grow independently from costimulatory signals .
In the present study we have analyzed the early events of CD28 activation in primary T lymphocytes .
Since most effects after CD28 stimulation are only observed in conjunction with TCR activation , we looked for a unique signal that was predominantly triggered by CD28 alone .
We found that CD28 stimulation resulted in the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which have recently been implicated as important second messenger molecules ( reviewed by Baeuerle and 3732 Henkel , 1994 ; Schulze-Osthoff and Baeuerle , 1995 ) .
ROI formation by CD28 involved the activation of S-lipoxygenase and inhibition of this enzyme was able to block activation of the CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 secretion .
These results suggest that the lipoxygenase metabolite leukotriene B4 may be an important effector molecule of the CD28 signaling pathway .
Results CD28 ligation induces IL-2 secretion and NF-xB activation To investigate the biochemical events associated with CD28 signaling , primary T lymphocytes were treated with agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies , with and without anti-CD3 antibodies activating the T cell receptor ( TCR ) complex .
As shown in Figure 1 A , ligation of neither CD28 nor the TCR led to a significant secretion of IL-2 into the supernatant .
Combined treatment with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 , however , strongly induced IL-2 production .
The enhancement of IL-2 gene expression by the CD28 costimulus has been found to be mediated by the CD28-responsive element ( CD28RE ) localized at position -162 to -152 within the IL-2 promoter ( Fraser et al. , 1991 ; Verweij et al. , 1991 ) .
After costimulation , the CD28RE is bound by a CD28 response complex ( CD28RC ) which has been shown to contain members of the NF-KB family ( Costello et al. , 1993 ; Ghosh et al. , 1993 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) demonstrated that stimulation of T lymphocytes with anti-CD28 plus anti-CD3 induced a CD28RE-binding complex that was not detect able after stimulation with either agent alone ( Figure 1B ) .
To analyze the specificity of the newly formed complex , competition analyses with unlabeled oligonucleotides were performed .
Formation of the slowly migrating CD28RC was competed by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled CD28RE oligonucleotide ( Figure 1C , lane 2 ) but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) or by an oligonucleotide mutated in the CD28RE ( lane 5 ) .
DNA binding was also competed by an oligonucleotide with a classical < B-binding site ( Figure 1C , lane 3 ) , indicating that CD28RC consisted of members of the NF-xB family .
NF-xB complexes may constitute a variety of different homo- and heterodimers of the NF-KB-Rel family of transcription factors .
To analyze the subunit composition of the CD28-induced complex , supershift assays were employed .
Antibodies against the NF-KB subunits p50 , p65 and c-Rel were added to an extract of cells stimulated with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 .
The CD28-induced DNA binding complex was totally retarded by anti-p50 ( Figure 1D , lane 2 ) and also partially by anti-p65 ( lane 3 ) .
Anti-c-Rel caused a reduction of DNA binding ( Figure 1D , lane 4 ) , whereas an unrelated ( anti-TNF ) IgG antibody had no effect ( lane 5 ) .
These data indicate the presence of p50 , p65 and c-Rel in the CD28-inducible DNA complex .
CD28 ligation induces a pro-oxidant condition in T lymphocytes Biological effects of CD28 , such as IL-2 production or NF-KB activation , can be observed only in conjunction with TCR activation .
In order to investigate CD28-specific signaling events we looked for rapid effects that could be monitored solely by ligation of the CD28 receptor .
It has previously been reported that CD28-mediated activation of NF- « B/CD28RC is prevented by antioxidants , suggesting that ROIs are involved in the CD28 signaling pathway ( Costello et al. , 1993 ; Los et al. , 1994 ) .
Measurement of intracellular H , O ; levels by FACS analysis with the dye dichlorofluorescine demonstrated that anti-CD28 alone induced a strong increase of intracellular H , O ; levels ( Figure 2A and B ) .
This oxidative shift was detectable within 5 min after cell stimulation and was maximal after 30 min ( data not shown ) .
An isotype-matched control antibody , however , had no effects ( Figure 2A ) .
Production of H , O , was significantly weaker after stimulation with anti-CD3 whereas the combined stimuli resulted in additive effects .
In parallel , we analyzed the levels of intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) , the major cellular antioxidant , using FACS analysis of monochlorobimane-stained cells ( Rice et al. , 1986 ) .
Corresponding to the increase of H ; O ; , anti-CD28 alone induced a rapid decrease of GSH ( Figure 2A and B ) .
This decrease was visible 10 min after CD28 ligation , maximal after 30 min and was then gradually restored within 12 h ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that CD28 signaling is associated with a rapid and transient shift towards pro-oxidant conditions .
Measurement of H , O ; production and GSH depletion , therefore , should allow us to delineate the sequence of biochemical effects triggered upon CD28 ligation .
The activation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases has been implicated as a primary step of CD28 activation and other signaling pathways .

In accordance , anti-CD28-induced H ; 0 ; production and GSH depletion ( Figure 3A ) as well as activation of NF- « B/CD28RC ( Figure 3B ) were completely inhibited by herbimycin A .
These results illustrate that oxidative events can be linked to early steps of CD28 signaling , such as the activation of tyrosine kinases .
Furthermore , certain enzymes producing ROIs upon CD28 ligation are likely to act downstream of tyrosine kinases .
Involvement of lipoxygenase in CD28 signaling Several enzymes and intracellular electron transfer reactions are known to produce ROIs which may be involved in intracellular signaling events ( Halliwell and Gutteridge , 1990 ) .
These include enzymes involved in lipid peroxidation , such as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase , the mem-brane-bound NADPH oxidase , xanthine oxidase and the mitochondrial respiratory chain .
To identify the source of ROIs produced in response to CD28 ligation we investigated a number of inhibitors of these enzymes for an effect on CD28-mediated H , O , production and GSH decrease .
Initial experiments performed in primary and Jurkat T lymphocytes revealed that neither diphenylene iodonium , an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase , nor rotenone , a respiratory chain inhibitor , nor allopurinol , an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase , exerted any profound effects ( data not shown ) .
However , we observed that in particular redox inhibitors 3733 M.Los et al .

of lipid peroxidation , such as butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) or nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( NDGA ) , were able to inhibit CD28-mediated oxidative events as well as NF-xB activation and IL-2 production , indicating that enzymes of lipid peroxidation may be involved in CD28 signaling .
Figure 4 shows that the methoxytetrahydropyran compound ICI 230487 , a potent non-redox inhibitor of lipoxygenase ( Crawley et al. , 1993 ) , strongly inhibited CD28-induced H ; O ; , production and GSH decrease .
Another compound , MK 886 , which inhibits leukotriene bio-synthesis by preventing the translocation of the 5-lipoxy-genase-activating protein ( FLAP ) to the membrane ( Rouzer et al. , 1990 ) , had similar effects , indicating that S-lipoxygenase or a closely related lipoxygenase may be involved in CD28 signaling events ( Figure 4 ) .
In contrast .
cyclooxygenases which have been also reported to initiate oxidative stress , are unlikely to be involved in the CD28 signaling pathway .
Indomethacin ( Figure 4 ) and aspirin ( data not shown ) , two unrelated inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase , did not inhibit , and even slightly augmented H , O , production .
This effect might be explained by the fact that inhibition of cyclooxygenase leads to the accumulation of arachidonic acid .
thereby providing increased amounts of substrate for the lipoxygenase reaction .

( B ) Effect on GSH levels .
CD28 ligation triggers arachidonic acid and leukotriene B4 release The lipoxygenase pathway is coupled to phospholipase A ; ( PLA ; ) which provides arachidonic acid for leukotriene biosynthesis .
Inhibition of PLA ; by dexamethasone significantly inhibited CD28-induced production of HO ; and depletion of GSH ( Figure SA ) .
The involvement of PLA ; in the CD28 signaling cascade was further demonstrated by measurement of arachidonic acid release .
Stimulation of T lymphocytes with anti-€CD28 resulted in a strong release of arachidonic acid whereas anti-CD3 or a control antibody had no or only weak effects ( Figure 5B ) .
Consistent with oxidative events , CD28-triggered arachidonic acid release was inhibited by dexamethasone and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A ( Figure 5B ) , whereas inhibitors of lipoxygenase had no effect ( data not shown ) .
To confirm the involvement of lipoxygenase we measured the production of leukotrienes after crosslinking of CD28 , with and without activation of the TCR .
Figure 5C demonstrates that anti-CD28 induced a strong increase in leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) production which was not observed after stimulation with anti-CD3 or a control antibody .
Costimulation by both agents did not result in a significant difference , suggesting that lipoxygenase was selectively activated by a CD28-mediated signal .
In addition , time course experiments revealed that the production of LTB4 was rapidly induced reaching a maximum 1 h after CD28 stimulation ( Figure 5D ) .
Liberation of other lipoxygenase products .
such as the peptidyl leukotrienes LTC4 , LTD4 and LTE4 , however , was not significantly increased by anti-CD28 ( data not shown ) .

Cells were labeled with [ *HJarachidonic acid and either left untreated or treated with herbimycin A ( HA , 0.5 ug/ml ) or dexamethasone ( Dexa , 5 uM ) .
8 h later , cells were treated with anti-CD28 ( black bars ) or medium ( open bars ) , with or without anti-CD3 .
For control , an isotype-matched control antibody ( IgG1 ) was used .
Arachidonic acid release was measured following 2 h of stimulation in cell-free supernatants .
100 % arachidonic acid release corresponded to 26 500 c.p.m .
( C ) Production of leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) after stimulation with anti-CD28 , anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 + anti-CD3 and effects of various inhibitors of CD28 signaling on leukotriene release .

Release of leukotrienes in cell-free supernatants was measured by an ELISA system 1 h following cell stimulation .
( D ) Time course of LTB4 release after stimulation with anti-CD28 .
Cells were stimulated with 1 ug/ml anti-CD28 and supernatants were harvested after the indicated time points .
pretreatment of T cells with herbimycin A or dexamethasone strongly inhibited anti-CD28-induced LTB4 release ( Figure 5C ) .
Corresponding to the effects observed on H , O ; production , LTB4 release was nearly completely prevented using the lipoxygenase inhibitors ICI 230487 and MK 886 ( Figure 5C ) .
Lipoxygenase inhibition specifically affects NF-xB/CD28SRC activation The experiments suggested the involvement of tyrosine kinases , PLA ; and 5-lipoxygenase in CD28 signaling .
To prove the functional importance of these molecules , we investigated the effect of inhibition of these pathways on CD28-mediated activation of CD28RC and IL-2 production .
Since T cells respond to anti-CD28 by ROI formation and since the lipoxygenases are known to give rise to elevated ROI formation ( Gagnon et al. , 1989 ; Halliwell and Gutteridge , 1990 ) , we also analyzed the effects of the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) .
In addition to the glucocorticoid receptor-dependent PLA ; inhibitor _- dexamethasone , _ p-bromophenacyl-bromide ( BPB ) was included as an unrelated irreversible inhibitor of PLA ; ( Lister et al. , 1989 ) .
To this end , T lymphocytes were pretreated with herbimycin A , dexamethasone , BPB , ICI 230487 , MK 886 or PDTC and then stimulated with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 .
Non-toxic concentrations of all substances effectively inhibited DNA binding activity of CD28RC ( Figure 6A ) as well as anti-CD28-induced IL-2 production ( Figure 6B ) .
This indicated that activation of a tyrosine kinase , followed by activation of PLA , and lipoxygenase and the formation of ROIs are all functionally involved in CD28-triggered biological effects .
T cell activation and IL-2 expression is subject to a complex regulation by a number of transcription factors .
Notably , the ubiquitous factors AP-1 and NF-IL2A ( which is indistinguishable from the octamer binding factor Oct- 1 ) as well as the T cell-specific transcription factor NF-AT have all been shown to be critical for IL-2 expression in response to TCR activation ( Crabtree and Clipstone , 1994 ; Rao , 1994 ) .
To examine the specificity of the proposed pathway for CD28 responses , we monitored the effects of the inhibitors on TCR-specific transcription factors .
NF-IL2ZA activity was constitutively expressed and not significantly affected by TCR and CD28 crosslinking nor by the inhibitors ( Figure 6C ) .
DNA binding of AP-1 and NF-AT was induced by anti-CD3 but not further enhanced by anti-CD28 ( Figure 6C , lanes 2-4 ) .
Herbimycin A strongly prevented DNA binding of both transcription factors which 3735 M.Los et al .

Effects of exogenous leukotrienes on IL-2 secretion and CD28RC activation .
( A ) Effects on IL-2 secretion .
T lymphocytes were treated with 50 nM LTB4 or LTC4 .
Supernatants were assessed for IL-2 48 h after cell stimulation .
( B ) Effects on CD28RC activation .
Cells were stimulated with the indicated reagents and 50 nM LTBA4 .
In lanes 5-8 , cells were incubated with the indicated inhibitors as described in Figure 6A and then treated with anti-CD3 and LTB4 for 2 h. A section of the flurogram is shown .
Similar to CD28RC , both factors were also inhibited by dexamethasone ( Figure 6C , lane 5 ) , whereas BPB inhibited CD28RC but had no effect on AP-1 and NF-AT ( lane 6 ) .
This suggested that dexamethasone inhibited both transcription factors independently of PLA ; involvement .
Indeed , previous reports have demonstrated that dexamethasone downregulates DNA binding of AP-1 through the direct interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with AP-1 ( Jonat et al. , 1990 ; Vacca et al. , 1992 ) .
NF-AT which consists of the calcium/calcineurin-responsive subunit NF-ATp and newly synthesized AP-1 components ( Rao , 1994 ) has been reported to be also inhibited by glucocorticoids ( Paliogianni et al. , 1993 ) .
However , unlike CD28RC , AP-1 and NF-AT were not inhibited by the two lipoxygenase inhibitors ( Figure 6C , lanes 7-8 ) , and also the antioxidant PDTC exerted no significant effects ( lane 1 ) .
Thus these data indicate that signaling events downstream of protein tyrosine phosphorylation are different for CD28RC and NF-AT and AP-1 , respectively .
LTB4 mimics anti-CD28 effects The results indicated that leukotrienes , such as LTB4 , may be important messenger molecules during CD28 signal transduction .
We therefore investigated whether exogenous leukotrienes could substitute for anti-CD28 effects .
As shown in Figure 7A , LTB4 slightly induced IL-2 secretion , whereas LTC4 had virtually no effects .
Similar to the CD28 costimulus , however , LTB4-induced IL-2 production was potentiated by TCR stimulation .
In addition , analysis of CD28RC-DNA binding demonstrated that LTB4 , when added in combination with anti-CD3 , could mimic anti TCR ( PTKs ) .

Proposed model for signal transduction by CD28 .
CD28 ligation activates a Src-related protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) and PI-3 kinase ( PI-3K ) as initial events leading to the stimulation of phospholipase A ; ( PLA ; ) .
Formed arachidonic acid is a substrate for S-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) to generate hydroxyeicosatetranoic acids and leukotrienes .
These products give rise to the formation of ROIs which then activate the transcription factor Also the TCR pathway requires the initial activation of PTKs , such as p56** , p59 '' and ZAP-70 .
These deliver signals that are coupled to at least three pathways including p21 '' '' /MAP kinase ( MAPK ) activation , stimulation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and a calcium/ calcineurin-dependent signal .
These pathways result in the activation of the TCR-inducible transcription factors AP-1 and NF-AT .
Although the signaling cascade differs between CD28 and the TCR , extensive crosstalk may allow complementation and synergy resulting in full IL-2 expression : CD28 may cooperate with the TCR in activation of p59 '' PTK .
In some situations , CD28 ligation triggers a calcium-dependent signal ( dashed line ) .
Diacylglycerol ( DAG ) formed by phospholipase CyI ( PLCy1 ) may be converted by DAG lipase to arachidonic acid and redirected into the LOX pathway .
A rise in cytosolic free calcium may activate calcium-dependent PLA ; and LOX .
Furthermore , CD28-mediated signals may be enhanced by ROI formation through the TCR which may be induced by a rise in calcium or PLCy activation .
CD28 effects ( Figure 7B , lane 4 ) , whereas the sole addition of LTB4 to T lymphocytes had no effects ( lane 3 ) .
Activation of CD28RC by LTB4 was considerably weaker than in response to anti-CD28 ( Figure 7B , compare lanes 4 and 9 ) .
In contrast to anti-CD28 responses , induction of DNA binding was not prevented by the inhibitors of tyrosine kinase , PLA ; and lipoxygenase activity ( Figure 7B , lanes 5-7 ) .
The antioxidant PDTC , however , completely prevented CD28RC activation in response to LTB4 ( Figure 7B , lane 8 ) .
Thus signals elicited after CD28 ligation can obviously be at least partially mimicked by exogenous LTB4 .
Discussion CD28 has been identified as a costimulatory receptor that provides the major second signal necessary for T cell function .
Despite its fundamental importance for T cell development and the immune response , the biochemical basis of CD28 accessory signals is poorly understood .
Most studies have been performed in transformed T cell lines which may be unsuitable since they may bypass costimulatory signals required for IL-2 expression and cell proliferation .
Identification of CD28-specific second messenger molecules is further hampered by the fact that biological effects of CD28 signaling are observed only in conjunction with TCR activation .
Thus a central question is whether the CD28 pathway is simply enhancing or sustaining the signals provided by the TCR or whether two independent pathways exist .
Triggering of the TCR-CD3 complex initiates a signal cascade that leads to a rise in cytosolic free calcium , formation of diacylglycerol and the activation of protein kinase C and other kinases ( Mueller et al. , 1989 ; Crabtree and Clipstone , 1994 ; cf .
Figure 8 ) .
This calcium-dependent pathway is blocked by the immunosuppressive calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506 .
A characteristic feature of the CD28 pathway is its refractoriness to cyclosporin A , suggesting that CD28 triggers an independent pathway that is distinct from the TCR ( June et al. , 1994 ) .
In an attempt to investigate early events of the CD28 pathway we looked for signals that were triggered by 3737 M.Los et al .
CD28 activation in the absence of TCR ligation .
We found that treatment of peripheral T lymphocytes with anti-CD28 resulted in the rapid and transient increase of H , O ; formation which was paralleled by a concomitant depletion of the antioxidant glutathione ( GSH ) .
In contrast , these oxidative events were less pronounced in response to anti-CD3 .
In order to identify the source of ROIs produced in response to CD28 ligation we investigated the effects of inhibitors of several biochemical pathways .
Pretreatment of T lymphocytes with the Src-like tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A significantly inhibited H , O ; production and GSH depletion as well as NF-KB/CD28RC activation and IL-2 expression .
This is in line with previous studies indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the initiation of CD28 responses ( Lu et al. , 1992 ; Vandenberghe et al. , 1992 ; Nunes et al. , 1994 ) .
Inhibition of PLA ; was also able to prevent CD28-mediated oxidative events and IL-2 expression , though to a lesser extent than herbimycin A .
The release of arachidonic acid was observed after stimulation with anti-CD28 but not with anti-CD3 .
Since PLA ; is activated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation , it can be suggested that arachidonic acid release is an event triggered further downstream upon CD28 ligation .
Arachidonic acid is converted either by cyclooxygenases to prostaglandins and related products or by lipoxygenases to leukotrienes .
Both pathways may give rise to intracellular ROI formation ( Halliwell and Gutteridge , 1990 ) .
Whereas cyclooxygenase inhibitors , such as indomethacin and aspirin , had no effects , various unrelated lipoxygenase inhibitors strongly inhibited CD28-mediated signaling .
These included the traditionally used redox-dependent inhibitors NDGA and BHA , and , in particular , the recently developed compounds MK 886 and ICI 230487 , which selectively inhibit S-lipoxygenase ( Rouzer et al. , 1990 ; Crawley et al. , 1993 ) .
CD28 ligation resulted in the rapid release of the 5-lipoxygenase metabolite LTB4 which was not observed in response to TCR stimulation .
Of note , the time course of LTB4 release coincided with the activation of NF-xB/CD28RC .
We further observed that CD28-induced NF-KB activation and IL-2 release were completely abolished by antioxidants , which concurs with our initial observation that formation of a pro-oxidant condition is selective for the CD28 response .
Since leukotriene synthesis involves ROI production , for instance in the metabolism of hydroxyeicosatetranoic acids ( Gagnon et al. , 1989 ) , ROI formation may be the ultimate step leading to activation .
Several studies have shown that activation of NF-KB in response to other stimuli , such as cytokines or lipopolysaccaride , is abolished by antioxidants ( Staal et a/. , 1990 ; Mihm er al. , 1991 ; Schreck et al. , 1991 ; Meyer et al. , 1993 ; Schulze-Osthoff et al. , 1993 ; Schenk et al. , 1994 ) , suggesting that ROIs may represent widely used second messenger molecules .
However , the mechanisms by which ROIs are produced in response to these various NF-xB-activating stimuli have not carefully been investigated so far .
In the case of TNF , it has been shown that ROIs produced during mitochondrial respiration are involved in gene-inducing effects of the cytokine ( Schulze-Osthoff et al. , 1993 ) .
In the present study , we show that ROI formation in response to anti-CD28 involves 5-lipoxygenase or a closely related lipoxygenase , and it will 3738 be interesting to examine whether other inducers of NF-xB converge in this pathway or utilize other mechanisms of ROI production .
The present data suggest that LTB4 is an important intermediate of the CD28 pathway .
LTB4 is a pro-inflam-matory lipid which exerts several biological functions ( reviewed in Samuelsson et al. , 1987 ; Rola-Pleszezynski et al. , 1993 ) .
In monocytes , LTB4 was found to induce the expression of TNF , IL-1 , IL-6 and the IL-2 receptor a chain by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms ( Gagnon et al. , 1989 ; Rola-Pleszezynski and Stankova , 1992 , Stankova et al. , 1993 ) .
Also expression of these genes in response to platelet-activating factor or lipopolysaccharide has been suggested to involve endo-genous LTB4 production ( reviewed in Rola-Pleszczynksi et al. , 1993 ) .
In monocytes , LTB4 can directly induce NF-xB activation which is inhibited by antioxidants ( Brach et al. , 1992 ) .
We therefore investigated whether exo-genously added LTB4 could substitute for the CD28 costimulus .
LTB4 did indeed induce IL-2 production and NF- « B/CD28RC activation , although the induction was considerably weaker than anti-CD28 .
In the absence of anti-CD3 , LTB4 had no effects indicating that , in a similar fashion to the CD28 signal , LTB4 provided a complementary signal for TCR pathway .
The activation of NF-xB in response to LTB4 could be inhibited by antioxidants but not by the other inhibitors .
This suggested that not only the synthesis of LTB4 ( during conversion of arachidonic acid to endoperoxides ) is coupled to ROI formation , but also LTB4 itself may cause the generation of ROIs , presumably by a reverse oxidizing reaction .
The model in Figure 8 proposes a CD28 signaling cascade which is initiated by the activation of a still unknown Src-like tyrosine kinase , followed by the activation of PLA ; and S-lipoxygenase which finally leads to pro-oxidant-induced activation of NF-KB/CD28RC and functional IL-2 expression .
The proposed pathway differs substantially from the TCR signaling mechanism .
To analyze the specificity for CD28 , we monitored the effect of the inhibitors on the transcription factors NF-AT and AP-1 which are activated by TCR ligation and not further induced by anti-CD28 .
Neither lipoxygenase inhibitors nor antioxidants prevented the activation of these TCR-inducible transcription factors , indicating that the proposed pathway is indeed selective for CD28 .
However , despite substantial differences between both pathways , extensive crosstalk and interaction may exist which may explain the synergistic effect of TCR and CD28 stimulation .
TCR signaling initially involves p56 '' , p59 '' and ZAP-70 tyrosine kinases , followed by the activation of the p21 ' '' G-protein , phospholipase Cy-mediated phosphoinositol turnover , calcium release and activation of Ser/Thr kinases ( Crabtree and Clipstone , 1994 ; Izquierdo Pastor et al. , 1995 ) .
It is conceivable that the release of calcium triggered by the TCR may co-activate PLA , and S-lipoxygenase which are dependent on calcium ions ( Samuelsson et al. , 1987 ; Ford-Hutchinson et al. , 1994 ) .
DAG formed by TCR-activated PLCy may be converted to arachidonic acid by DAG lipase and thereby redirected to the lipoxygenase pathway .
In addition , it has been found recently that the protein phosphatase calcineurin may be involved in NF-xB activation in T cells by increasing IB degradation ( Frantz et al. , 1994 ) .
This might explain the observation that activation of NF-xB/CD28RC requires two simultaneous signals and that neither anti-CD28 nor anti-CD3 alone are sufficient to induce activation .
In summary , our present study provides important new details about the mechanism of the CD28 costimulus .
Since CD28 plays an essential role in numerous immune and inflammatory processes , such as allograft rejection and cytotoxic T cell antitumor response , selective inhibition or potentiation of the biochemical events described may be useful for therapeutic targeting of the CD28 pathway .
