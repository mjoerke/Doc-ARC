12 The Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Promoter cis-Acting Element CLEO Mediates Induction Signals in T Cells and Is Recognized by Factors Related to API and NFAT ESTEBAN S.

We have previously shown that a fragment containing bp -95 to +27 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter can confer inducibility to reporter genes in the human Jurkat T-cell line .
Here we use an in vitro transcription system to demonstrate that a cis-acting element ( positions -54 to -40 ) , referred to as CLEO , is a target for the induction signals .
We observed induction with templates containing intact CLEO but not with templates with deleted or mutated CLEO .
We also observed that two distinct signals were required for the stimulation through CLEO , since only extracts from cells treated with both phorbol myristate acetate and A23187 supported optimal induction .
Stimulation probably was mediated by CLEO-binding proteins because depletion of these proteins specifically reduced GM-CSF transcription .
One of the binding factors possessed biochemical and immunological features identical to those of the transcription factor AP1 .
Another factor resembled the T-cell-specific factor NFAT .
The characteristics of these two factors are consistent with their involvement in GM-CSF induction .
The presence of CLEO-like elements in the promoters of interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , IL-4 , IL-5 , GM-CSF , and NFAT sites in the IL-2 promoter suggests that the factors we detected , or related factors that recognize these sites , may account for the coordinate induction of these genes during T-cell activation .
When T lymphocytes encounter antigen in the proper context , they are activated and produce an array of protein mediators that regulate a variety of immune responses and inflammation ( 3 , 9 ) .
These mediators are collectively called T-cell-derived cytokines and include a variety of interleu-kins , hemopoietic growth factors , and inflammation factors .
The mechanisms that lead to coordinate production of these cytokines are being actively investigated .
For most cytokines , it appears that their expression is regulated predominantly by initiation of transcription of their genes ( 3 , 5 , 9 ) .
Comparisons of the regions upstream of cytokine gene promoters have revealed a number of conserved lymphokine elements : CLE1 ( CK1 ) , CLE2 ( CK2 ) , and CLEO ( 3 , 20 , 32 ) .
In addition , the fact that immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin A ( CsA ) reduce or totally inhibit expression of cytokines in T cells suggests that there exists a common link in their regulation ( 35 ) .
The coupling of activation signals received at the cell surface to the initiation of transcription seems to involve many components , each of which may be regulated during the process of cell activation .
Antigen recognition in the context of an antigen-presenting cell by the T-cell receptor rapidly switches on several signaling events , including protein phosphorylation , calcium mobilization , and inositol phospholipid hydrolysis ( 15 , 40 ) .
With regards to transcriptional activation , these signals can be bypassed by the use of * Corresponding author .
7399 phorbol esters ( i.e. , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [ PMA ] ) and calcium ionophores ( i.e. , A23187 ) ( 40 ) .
Addition of both of these agents causes maximal induction of most cytokine genes ( 4 , 9 ) .
Yet the absolute requirement for the action of both PMA and A23187 varies for different cytokines , indicating that one pathway sometimes dominates over the other ( 4 ) .
We have focused on the regulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene expression in T cells .
Both PMA and A23187 are required to induce expression of GM-CSF ; CsA or FK506 can completely inhibit this induction ( 4 ) .
After T-cell stimulation , GM-CSF mRNA can be detected in 2 to 4 h. The presence of this mRNA is largely due to transcription initiation ( 5 , 19 , 25 ) and requires the synthesis of specific factors , since cycloheximide ( CHX ) , a protein synthesis inhibitor , blocks GM-CSF expression at the early stages of stimulation ( 27 , 29 ) .
We have been characterizing presumed regulatory elements in the 5° flanking region of the mouse GM-CSF gene .
This 5 ' region is highly conserved between murine and human clones ; e.g. , there is approximately 85 % identity over the region extending about 360 bp upstream the transcription initiation site ( 18 ) .
Using transient transfection assays of 5 deletion constructs in the human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cell line , we found that the region from positions -95 to +27 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter region was capable of mediating induction in response to PMA plus A23187 ( 19 ) .
Further analysis identified two essential elements within this sequence , referred to as GM- « B/GC and CLEO elements .
7400 MASUDA ET AL .
GM- « B/GC is a 23-bp cis-acting region ( positions -95 to -73 ) that consists of two binding sites : GM- « B ( previously called GM2 ) and a GC box .
GM- « B defines a binding site for a protein induced by PMA whose characteristics are identical to those of the transcription factor NF- « B ( 30 , 39 ) .
The GC box defines a site for constitutively bound proteins ( 36 ) .
The other element , CLEO ( positions -54 to -40 ) , lies near the TATA box ; its sequence is similar to those of elements present in the regulatory regions for the interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) and IL-5 genes ( 20 ) .
Here , we report that CLEO is essential for induction of transcription at the GM-CSF promoter .
These experiments were performed in vitro with a transcription system prepared from T cells .
We found that CLEO is recognized by two factors , one with the characteristics of transcription factor AP1 , and the other with features similar to those of NFAT .
Finally , the implication of AP1 , NFAT , or related factors in the induction of other T-cell-derived cytokines through CLEO-like elements is discussed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotides and immunoreagents .
The oligonucleotides used for competition and mobility shift assays contained the following sequences ( only one strand is shown ; sequence overhangs are presented in lowercase ) : CLEO element ( 20 ) , 5'-gatcGTCACCATTAATCATTITTCCTCTAA CTGT-3 ' ; API site ( 22 ) , gm-mul,2 ( 36 ) , 5'-gatcAGGTAGTTCCCCCGCCCCCC-3 ' ; IgkB ( 21 ) , 5-gatcTCAACAGAGGGGACTTITTCCGAGAG GCC-3 ' ; and NFAT site ( 11 ) , 5'-gatcGGAGGAAAAACT GTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3 ' .
GM47 and GM43,47 correspond to the CLEO oligonucleotide with a single substitution at position -47 and substitutions at both positions -43 and -47 , respectively , as shown in Fig .

Rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against the N-terminal half ( « Fos-alu ) or the basic region ( « Fos-WB2.3 ) of c-Fos were kindly provided by T. Kerppola and T. Curran ( Roche Institute of Molecular Biology , Nutley , N.J. ) .
Other immunoglobulin G antibodies used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Plasmids .
All plasmids used as templates for in vitro transcription were digested with Fnu4HI , except for the adenovirus major late ( AdML ) promoter template , which was prepared by NdeI digestion of plasmid pDNAdML ( 8 ) .
Plasmids pGM6OLuc , pGM32Luc , pGM19Luc , and pGM+3Luc were constructed by replacing the chloram-phenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene from the corresponding CAT constructs ( 19 ) with the luciferase gene as described previously ( 13 ) .
The constructions of pGM97Luc ( also referred to as pKC1 ) , pKC30 , and pIL2Luc-1 will be reported elsewhere ( 38 ) .
Plasmid pKC30 is analogous to p43-48 ( 20 ) but with the luciferase reporter instead of the CAT gene .
Plasmid pIL2Luc1 , which contains positions -567 to +47 of the IL-2 gene , was derived from pIL2CAT-1 ( obtained from G. Crabtree , Stanford University ) .
Plasmid pGM6OLucl,2 ( 36 ) is analogous to pGM97Luc but has a reduced linker space between the GM- « B/GC and CLEO elements ( 39 ) , giving slightly higher transcriptional activity .
In vitro transcription .
Jurkat T cells were cultured as described by Miyatake et al .
( 20 ) .
Unless otherwise men-tioned , cells were stimulated for 2 h with PMA at 50 ng/ml and A23187 at 1.0 M. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al .
( 10 ) , using 0.2 % Nonidet P-40 to disrupt the cells as described previously ( 36 ) .
Runoff transcription assays were carried as described by Miyatake et al .

template DNA , and a final KCl concentration of 100 mM .
Radioactivity in runoff transcripts was quantitated by using the PhosphorImager system ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Depletion of CLEO-binding proteins was performed by using Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin ( Dynal A/S ) coupled to bio-tinylated multimers of the CLEO element as described by Gabrielsen et al .
( 12 ) .
The depletion was done on nuclear extracts from PMA-A23187-stimulated cells that were adjusted to 100 mM KCl in the presence of 10 mg of poly ( dI-dC ) per ml .
Mobility shift assays .
Nuclear extracts used for runoff transcription assays were used for gel shift assays .
Alternatively , nuclear miniextracts were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al .
( 31 ) , modified as follows .
After the appropriate treatments , 2 x 10 '' to 5 x 10 '' Jurkat cells ( at 2 x 10° cells/ml ! )
were collected and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then with buffer A ( 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-NV ' -2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ; pH 7.6 ] , 15 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl , , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 mg of leupeptin per ml ) .
The cell pellet was then resuspended on ice with buffer A containing 0.2 % Nonidet P-40 and passed once through a syringe with a 27.5-gauge needle .
Nuclei were gently centrifuged ( ~800 x g ) , resuspended in buffer A containing 0.25 M sucrose , and again pelleted by centrifugation .
Nuclear proteins were extracted with constant shaking for 30 min at 4°C with 40 to 100 ml of a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 400 mM KCl , 10 % glycerol , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 10 mg of leupeptin per ml .
The extract was centrifuged , and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80°C .
The DNA-binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) -10 % glycerol-1 mM EDTA-1 mM DTT-50 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) per ml-250 pg of bovine serum albumin per mIl-KCl adjusted to 100 mM-~0.5 ng of labeled probe ( ~50,000 cpm ) -2 to 10 ug of nuclear extract .
Samples were loaded onto 4 % native acrylamide gel ( Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer ) , run at 120 V , dried , and autoradiographed for 1 to 6 h at room temperature .
Preparation of AP1 from Jurkat T cells .
Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells stimulated for 2 to 3 h with PMA-A23187 were prepared as described above .
Fractions containing purified API were obtained as described by Lee et al .
( 16 ) , with slight modifications .
Proteins were precipitated with 45 % instead of 53 % ( NH , ) , SO , , and a Superose 6 ( Pharma-cia ) instead of a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column was used .
Fractions eluted with 0.5 M NaCl from API site affinity chromatography were shown to contain API activity by mobility shift assays and Western blotting ( immunoblot-ting ) .
The fractions were collected into one pool , aliquoted , and stored at -80°C until further use .
The aliquots had a protein concentration of < 10 ng/pl .
Similarly obtained API from HeLa cells were kindly provided by M. McMahon ( DNAX Research Institute ) .
RESULTS Analysis of the GM-CSF promoter by in vitro transcription .
We have previously shown by promoter truncation studies that a fragment containing positions -95 to +27 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter region can confer inducibility to reporter plasmids in Jurkat T cells in response to the combination of the phorbol ester PMA and the calcium ionophore A23187 ( 13 , 19 ) .

Plasmid pKC30 contains a mutated CLEO element as described in the text .
These plasmids were digested with Fnu4HI for use as templates for transcription assays .
( B ) Runoff transcription assays on truncated templates were performed with 53 pg of protein per assay of nuclear extracts from stimulated Jurkat T cells .
The runoff transcript is 420 nucleotides ( nt ) long .
The size marker on the right lane ( M ) is Haelll-digested $ X174 phage DNA that had been radioactively end labeled .
( C ) Runoff transcription assays using nuclear extracts ( 50 ug per assay ) from nonstimulated ( - ) and stimulated ( + ) cells .
Radioactivity in the transcripts was quantitated by using a PhosphorImager system ( model 4008 ; Molecular Dynamics ) and normalized to values obtained for AdML promoter templates .
The fold stimulation shows the ratio between the transcription activity elicited by extracts from stimulated versus nonstimulated cells .
The results are representative of at least three experiments using different preparations of nuclear extracts .
assays .
For these assays , we used nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat cells that had been treated for 2 h with a combination of PMA and A23187 .
As templates , we used DNA fragments containing the promoter that had been truncated at different distances relative to the transcription initiation site ( Fig .
1A ) .
The results ( Fig .
1B ) demonstrate a gradual decrease of the transcription signal as the size of the deletion increased .
We tentatively concluded that both elements , GM- « B/GC and CLEO , and the TATA box played important roles in the extent of transcription initiation at the GM-CSF promoter .
These findings are in general agreement with the data obtained in prior transfection studies ( 19 , 20 , 25 ) .
The CLEO element confers inducibility to the GM-CSF promoter .
We next investigated the effects of the cis-acting elements on inducibility by comparing in vitro transcription activities in nuclear extracts prepared from cells that had been either mock stimulated or treated with PMA-A23187 .
We found that transcription of both the GM97Luc and GM6O0Luc templates was strongly inducible , whereas induction was not observed on the GM32Luc template ( Fig .
1C ) .
In fact , the slight induction seen with the GM32Luc template was comparable to that observed for the unrelated AdML promoter template ( data not shown ; see also Fig .
2 ) .
The GM-CSF transcripts were quantified and normalized to the AdML signal ( Fig .
1C ) .
We could see that templates truncated up to position -60 still retained inducibility , which implied that at least one of the determinants for inducibility was located between positions -60 and -32 , which contains the CLEO element .
Next , we checked the requirement for CLEO in the presence of an intact GM- « B/GC element .
We examined the KC3O template , which is analogous to GM97Luc but has a mutated CLEO element .
The mutation , which abolished induction as determined by transient transfection assays , is a substitution of the residues between positions -48 and -43 for a Spel site ( 5'-ACTAGT-3 ' ) ( 20 ) .
The results ( Fig .
1C , lanes 7 and 8 ) demonstrate that the CLEO mutant template allowed only slight induction of transcription , pinpointing the CLEO element as an essential target sequence required for induction of transcription of the GM-CSF gene .

The stimulation in vitro of GM-CSF promoter templates requires the activation of two signals .
In vitro transcription assays were carried out with nuclear extracts ( 50 ug per assay ) from cells stimulated under different conditions : nonstimulated ( N ) or stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 at 1.0 M ( A ) , PMA at 50 ng/m !
( P ) , or a combination of PMA and A23187 ( P/A ) .
Runoff transcripts lengths are 420 nucleotides ( nt ) for GM95Luc and GM6OLuc , 440 nucleotides for IL2Luc , and 250 nucleotides for AdML templates .
For calculation of fold induction , the bands were quantitated and compared with the signal with nonstimulated extracts ; the results are shown immediately below the corresponding lanes .
These values , normalized to the values obtained for the AdML template , are presented below the values for fold induction .
both PMA and Ca** ionophore .
One of the characteristics of induction of GM-CSF gene expression in T cells , which is shared with IL-2 gene expression , is the requirement for the activation of pathways by treatment with both PMA and Ca** ionophore ( 4 ) .
We examined this dual requirement by measuring transcription of the GM-CSF templates in vitro .
Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells mock treated , treated with PMA or A23187 , or treated with the combination of the two were prepared , and the transcription activity on different templates was assayed ( Fig .
2 ) .
The double-stimulation requirements seen with the IL2Luc template were also observed for both the GM97Luc and the GM6OLuc templates , while the activity on the AdML template was not altered significantly .
Again , the results with the GM6OLuc template suggested that pathways activated by both PMA and Ca** ionophore exert their effects through the CLEO element .
Multiple CLEO-binding factors mediate transcriptional activation .
To clarify the role of the CLEO element in the stimulation of transcription , we carried out transcription assays using nuclear extracts from stimulated cells that had been depleted of CLEO-binding proteins ( see Materials and Methods ) .
We found that depletion of > 80 % of the CLEO-binding proteins ( data not shown ) reduced transcription through the GM-CSF promoter but had minimal effects on the Ad ML promoter template ( Fig .
3A ) .
We believe that the reduction was not due to the depletion of a particular basic transcription factor because addition of twice the amount of extract doubled the AdML signal but could not reconstitute the GM-CSF transcription to its original signal ( Fig .
3A ) .
This result supports the view that the presence of CLEO-binding factors is necessary for transcriptional activation of the GM-CSF promoter .
We examined the protein factors that bound the CLEO element in a mobility shift assay .
The nuclear extracts used were from stimulated cells ; a labeled oligonucleotide containing the CLEO element was used as the target .
Previously , we and others reported two specific band shifts that reflected protein binding to the CLEO element ( 20 , 23 ) .
We found here that by increasing the amount of extract , yet another specific band can be observed .
We refer to the band shifts here as a , B , and y ( Fig .
3B ) .
A nonspecific band shift and could be observed with any oligonucleotide probe ( see below ) .
A factor related or identical to the transcription factor API binds at the 5 ' end of CLEO element .
During our characterization of CLEO-binding factors , we discovered that an unlabeled oligonucleotide probe containing a strong API site ( 22 ) could efficiently compete for the binding of B to the CLEO element ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
This effect was specific , as the oligonucleotide gm-mul,2 , which contains the GM- « B/GC element and is able to bind the factors NF- « B and Sp1 ( 39 ) , could not compete for B binding to CLEO ( Fig .

Relationship of CLEO-binding factors to the transcription factor AP1 .
Mobility shift assays were performed with oligonucleotide probes containing the CLEO element ( lanes 1 to 14 ) , the API site ( lanes 15 and 16 ) , and the IgxB site ( lanes 17 to 20 ) .
The binding reactions were carried out with 4 pg of nuclear extract from stimulated Jurkat cells ( lanes 1 to 10 and 17 to 19 ) .
Alternatively , 0.5 pl ( lane 11 ) or 1 wl ( lanes 12 , 15 , and 20 ) of API protein from Jurkat cells and 0.5 pl ( lane 13 ) or 1 pl ( lanes 14 and 16 ) of API protein from HeLa cells were used .
The bindings were challenged with unlabeled API site oligonucleotide at 20-fold ( lane 2 ) or 50-fold ( lanes 3 and 18 ) molar excess .
As a control , the competition was performed with the oligonucleotide GM1,2 at 20-fold ( lane 4 ) or 50-fold ( lane 5 ) molar excess .
Preincubation of reaction mixtures prior to addition of labeled probe with nonimmune ( lane 6 ) , « Fos-alu ( lanes 7 , 8 , and 19 ) , or « FosWB-2.3 ( lanes 9 and 10 ) antiserum was carried out for 15 min at room temperature .
Antiserum was added at amounts of 0.1 pl ( lanes 7 and 9 ) or 0.2 pl ( lanes 6 , 8 , 10 , and 19 ) .
lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Furthermore , the oligonucleotide bearing the AP1 site did not compete for the binding of NF- « B to the IgxB element ( Fig .
4 , lanes 17 and 18 ) .
The y band was not observed in these CLEO-binding assays because the assays were performed using 4 pg of nuclear extract , a concentration that makes the detection of the y band difficult ( Fig .
3B ) .
On closer examination , we found sequence similarity between the 5 ' end of the CLEO element ( 5'-TTAATCA-3 ' ) and the API consensus sequence ( 5'-TGASTCA-3 ' , where S is G or C ) .
In fact , the nucleotides that were different between the CLEO element sequence and the API site consensus sequence have been reported to be noncritical for the DNA binding of Fos-Jun heterodimer ( 28 ) .
We then checked the effect of antisera raised against c-Fos protein , a component of API , on B binding to CLEO .
Two different c-Fos antisera , « Fos-alu and « Fos-WB2.3 , were able to block and/or supershift B binding ( Fig .
4 , lanes 7 to 10 ) .
The control nonimmune antiserum did not affect B binding ( Fig .
4 , lane 6 ) , nor did the anti-c-Fos antiserum affect NF-KB binding to the IgkB element ( Fig .
4 , lane 19 ) .
Similar but less striking findings were obtained with immunoglobulin G antibodies specific for Jun polypeptides ( un-published data ) .
Next , we obtained partially purified API from extracts of stimulated Jurkat T cells and checked its binding activity to the CLEO probe .
We observed that fractions enriched in API from Jurkat cells gave the same mobility shifts : the doublet TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF GM-CSF IN T CELLS 7403 of bands , B and a , seen with crude nuclear extracts ( Fig .
4 , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
Similarly , AP1 obtained from HeLa cell extracts also bound to the CLEO element ; however , it did so weakly , and it shifted the probe to only one defined band with a mobility between B and a ( Fig .
4 , lanes 13 and 14 ) .
Interestingly , HeLa API did bind strongly to the API site probe ( Fig .
4 , lane 16 ) .
These differences between the Jurkat and HeLa AP1 fractions probably reflect heterogeneity and/or different modifications of the AP1 components in different cellular and physiological contexts ( 1 , 2 ) .
Finally , we compared various features of AP1 binding with those of B and a binding .
Consistent with the results presented above , the time course after stimulation and the response to CHX and CsA were similar between API binding and B binding ( Fig .
5 ) .
The inhibition of binding by CHX also indicated that de novo protein synthesis was required for the appearance of B-binding activity .
We found that there is a basal « activity , which is not blocked by the CHX treatments ( Fig .
5 ) .
NFAT binding was inhibited by CsA and was included in Fig .
5 as a positive control of CsA action .
Under the same conditions , however , neither API binding nor B and a bindings were affected .
Taken together , the results above demonstrated that B , and probably a , were related to the transcription factor APL .
CLEO is also recognized by a CsA-sensitive factor related to the nuclear factor of activated T cells , NFAT .
Continuing our characterization of the factors binding CLEO , we checked for their presence in nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 , PMA , or a combination of the two ( Fig .
6A ) .
A basal level of a and B was observed in unstimulated extracts ; this level was not affected by the addition of A23187 to the cells .
The addition of PMA , on the other hand , induced the amount of B and a bands .
Both bands were further increased by about twofold in extracts of cells stimulated with both PMA and A23187 and were unaffected by the addition of CsA ( Fig .
6A , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
Interestingly , the y band was observed mainly in extracts from cells stimulated with the PMA-A23187 combination ( Fig .
6A , lane 4 ) .
Moreover , we found that CsA could block the appearance of y ( Fig .
6A , lane 5 ) in a manner similar to that seen for NFAT binding ( Fig .
6A , lanes 6 to 10 ) .
In fact , alignment of the CLEO element with the NFAT binding site demonstrated the sequence similarity of the 3 ' portion of CLEO to part of the NFAT site ( see Fig .
7 ) .
Interestingly , a mutation at position -47 ( GM47 ) in CLEO ( see Fig .
7 ) , which completely abolished a and B binding , allowed binding of y .
This finding suggests that y binding and « /B binding can occur independently .
As expected , y binding to the GM47 probe was also dependent on stimulation by two signals and was blocked by treatment with CsA ( Fig .
6A , lanes 11 to 15 ) .
The use of competition experiments provided further supporting evidence for our interpretation of the y band ( Fig .
6B ) .
Unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the NFAT site or CLEO mutated at position -47 ( GM47 ) competed efficiently for binding of y but not of B and a to the CLEO element , while oligonucleotides containing mutations at both positions -43 and -47 ( GM43,47 ) did not to compete for y binding ( Fig .
6B , lanes 1 to 9 ) .
Similar competitions were seen for y binding to the GM47 probe ( Fig .
6B , lanes 10 to 18 ) .
Antisera raised against c-Fos protein could inhibit y binding to oligonucleotide GM47 , indicating that y , like NFAT , has a component related to the API factor ( 14 ) .
These results are consistent with y binding being due to a factor related or identical to NFAT .

Lanes 1 to 9 represent a time course in minutes after stimulation with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and A23187 ( 1.0 M ) .
The stimulations in the presence of increasing concentrations of CHX ( lanes 10 to 13 ) or CsA ( lanes 14 to 18 ) were done for a period of 3 h. All reagents were added within a span of 5 min .
DISCUSSION GM-CSF gene expression is induced during T-cell activation and is dependent on pathways activated by both phorbol ester and calcium ionophore ( 4 ) .
These features of GM-CSF expression were reflected in vitro in the results of runoff transcription assays .
We found that templates containing a small region ( positions -60 to +27 ) of the GM-CSF promoter were over three times more transcriptionally active with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells stimulated with PMA-A23187 than were nuclear extracts from cells that were not stimulated ( Fig .
1C ) .
Likewise , we observed a two-signal requirement for induction , as both phorbol ester and calcium ionophore treatments of the cells were necessary for optimal stimulation of transcription ( Fig .
2 ) .
Analysis of the transcription activity of truncated promoters revealed that one of the targets for this regulation was the CLEO element located between positions -54 and -40 with respect to the transcription initiation site ( Fig .
1A ) .
Indeed , we found that mutations in the CLEO sequence reduced transcription stimulation to almost basal levels even in the presence of an intact upstream GM- « kB/GC element ( Fig .
1C ) .
In addition , we observed a strong correlation between induction of transcription and an increase in the protein factors that bound to the CLEO element ( Fig .
6A ) .
We believe that this correlation is significant because depletion of these factors from the nuclear extracts caused reduction of transcription activity on GM-CSF templates while eliciting minimal changes of the activity on the control AdML templates ( Fig .
3A ) .
Our in vitro results showed that the CLEO element alone was able to confer inducibility and that the GM- « B/GC site enhanced the induction elicited through the CLEO element .
In our previous transfection assays , however , the CLEO element alone appeared to be insufficient to confer induction to the reporter gene ( 13 , 19 ) .
This lack of induction , on the other hand , could be overcome by multimerization of the CLEO element ; we observed good inducibility when three copies of CLEO were placed in front of the GM-CSF basal promoter ( 38 ) .
Also , Nimer et al .
have shown that reporter plasmids containing truncations up to the CLEO element ( i.e. , without the element ) of the corresponding human sequences of the GM-CSF promoter still retain inducibility in response to PMA-phytohemagglutinin treatments of T cells ( 25 ) .
Thus , the view that CLEO serves as a target for induction signals is also supported by in vivo experimental results .
We investigated the factors binding CLEO since they were good candidates for effecting the stimulation .
As it turned out , CLEO is a complex element that is bound by multiple factors of different sequence specificity .
One factor seems to be the well-known transcription factor AP1 .
Several lines of evidence indicated that we can relate the B and a bands , which bind CLEO , to the transcription factor API ( Fig .
4 ) .
First , both bands were abolished by an oligonucleotide bearing a strong API site .
Second , an anti-c-Fos antiserum blocked or supershifted the bands corresponding to B and « .
Third , partially purified API from Jurkat cells was able to bind and shift the CLEO probe to the B- and « -band posi-tions .
Finally , the appearance of AP1-binding activity upon stimulation closely paralleled that of the B band .
They were induced with the same kinetics and showed similar sensitivity to the drug CHX ( Fig .
5 ) .
In this vein , it is noted that CHX inhibits the expression of GM-CSF in Jurkat T cells ( 27 , 29 ) .
The lack of induction of API ( B activity ) in the presence of CHX may provide one explanation for the inhibition .
Further work is needed to clarify the difference between the constitutively present « band and the B band .
The presence of API binding , however , could not explain the stimulation at CLEO entirely .
Nuclear extracts from PMA-only-stimulated cells contained reasonably good API1-binding activity but supported little transcription stimulation ( Fig .
2 and 6A ) .
This was not unexpected , as sequences located 3 ' to the API site within the CLEO element had also been shown to be critical for CLEO action ( 20 ) .
Conceivably , an additional factor that was subject to regulation by the calcium signal was involved in the regulation .

CLEO is bound by a factor related to the transcription factor NFAT .
( A ) Mobility shift assays were carried out with 9 ug of nuclear extracts from cells stimulated for 3 h as indicated in the presence ( + ) and absence ( - ) of treatment of PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) , A23187 ( 1.0 wM ) , and CsA ( 1.0 ug/ml ) .
Labeled probes contained the CLEO element ( lanes 1 to 5 ) , the NFAT binding site ( lanes 6 to 10 ) , and the CLEO element with a mutation corresponding to position -47 ( GM47 ) ( lanes 11 to 15 ) .
( B ) Mobility shift assays using the CLEO and GM47 labeled probes and 10 pg of nuclear extracts from cells stimulated for 2 h with PMA and A23187 at the concentrations specified above .
Unlabeled oligonucleotides bearing the CLEO element ( lanes 2 , 3 , 11 , and 12 ) , CLEO mutated at position -47 ( GM47 ) ( lanes 4 , 5 , 13 , and 14 ) , CLEO mutated at positions -43 and -47 ( GM43,47 ) ( lanes 6 , 7 , 15 , and 16 ) , and the NFAT binding site ( lanes 8 , 9 , 17 , and 18 ) were added as competitors .
For sequence information , see Fig .
7 .
The competitors were added at a 20-fold ( even-numbered lanes ) or 50-fold ( odd-numbered lanes ) molar excess .
Preincubation prior to addition of labeled GM47 probe with 0.2 pl of nonimmune ( lane 19 ) or 0.2 pl of « Fos-alu ( lane 20 ) antiserum was for 15 min at room temperature .

TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF GM-CSF IN T CELLS 7405 Indeed , we observed the binding to the CLEO probe of another factor , as reflected by the y band .
Interestingly , this factor had characteristics similar to those of the nuclear factor of activated T cells , NFAT ( 33 ) .
NFAT and y shifted their respective probes to similar positions , and both were inhibited or supershifted by anti-Fos antibodies ( 14 ) ( Fig .
6 ) .
The similarity was further supported by sequence homology between the 3 ' half of CLEO and part of the NFAT binding site ( Fig .
7 ) .
In addition , similar to NFAT binding , the appearance of the y band in the nucleus required cell stimulation with both PMA and A23187 .
The double-stimulation requirement for the appearance of the y band is significant since it correlates with the double-stimulation requirement for GM-CSF induction .
Moreover , the inhibition of induction of the y band by the immunosup-pressant CsA also correlated with the inhibition by CsA of GM-CSF expression ( 4 ) and the inhibition of the GM-CSF promoter activity in transient transfection assays ( 38 ) .
In fact , we have recently shown that overexpression of cal-cineurin , a calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase , up-regulates GM-CSF promoter activity ( 38 ) in a manner similar to IL-2 promoter activation ( 6 , 26 ) .
In the IL-2 system , calcineurin has been shown to augment NFAT-dependent transcription .
Consequently , it is likely that the NFAT-like factor bound to CLEO ( and responsible for the y band ) confers on GM-CSF gene expression effects similar to those exerted by NFAT on IL-2 gene expression .
These findings also suggest that GM-CSF and IL-2 promoters may share components in their transcriptional regu-lation , thus providing an explanation for the similar induction kinetics and signal requirements between their expression in T cells .
Notably , the analogy may be extended since similar CLEO elements are found upstream the IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 genes ( Fig .
7 ) .
It is thus tempting to speculate that the presence of CLEO sites in the promoters/enhancers of these T-cell-derived cytokine genes indicates a role for factors related to AP1 and NFAT in their coordinate induction during T-cell activation .
This idea is supported by the recent identification by Cockerill et al .
( 7 ) of a 716-bp inducible CsA-sensitive enhancer located 3 kb upstream the GM-CSF gene .
This enhancer contains four API sites , three of which are similar to CLEO and are capable of binding NFAT .
This also raises the possibility that the induction of GM-CSF is regulated by a distant enhancer in conjunction with a promoter-proximal element .
It will be interesting to determine the cooperation , if any , between this enhancer and the promoter-proximal CLEO during the activation of GM-CSF gene transcription .
We have shown in additional experiments that NFAT-like ( y ) binding to CLEO spans a sequence of at least 12 bp that includes the AP1 binding site .
This indicates that their binding sites overlap .
However , we can not at this point determine the relative importance of a particular factor in induction .
In this respect , results from transient transfection assays seem to indicate that all factors are necessary , as all mutations tested that block the binding of one or two factors also showed limited induction ( 20 , 24 ) .
We do know that both AP1 and NFAT have the ability to bind the CLEO element independently .
The mutation at position -47 within the CLEO element , for instance , blocks API binding but retains the NFAT-like binding ( Fig .
6 ) .
This is not an artifact , as we have now found that NFAT purified over NFAT site affinity columns can bind the CLEO probe as a single band shifting the probe to a position that corresponds to y ( 37 ) .

Graphic representation of the mouse GM-CSF promoter and similarities of the CLEO element to the binding sites of API and NFAT .
The sequence spans positions -95 to +3 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter ( 18 ) .
The cis-acting sequences are enclosed by ellipses , the TATA box is doubled underlined , and the transcription initiation site is shown by a thick arrow .
The substitution mutations at positions -43 and -47 are shown by thin arrows .
Outlined letters represent nucleotides that are different or absent in the human GM-CSF ( hGMCSF ) promoter .
Homology between the 5 ' half of the API site and the 3 ' half of the CLEO element to the human IL-2 ( bIL2 ) NFAT binding site is indicated with vertical lines .
Below the human IL-2 NFAT site , the sequences of other similar elements located in the promoters of other T-cell-derived cytokine genes are presented .
The respective AP1-like site for each element is underlined .
Both human and murine IL-2 ( mIL2 ) NFAT sites have been shown to confer inducibility ( 14 , 33 ) .
The human IL-3 CLEO site contains the API site reported to be required for IL-3 promoter induction ( 17 , 34 ) .
The sequence positions of CLEO elements in IL-4 and IL-5 are shown in reference 20 .
CLEO , and their relationship to the basic transcription machinery should help clarify the mechanism of induction of GM-CSF expression through the CLEO element .
