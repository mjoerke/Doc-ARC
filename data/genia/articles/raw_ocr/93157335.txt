Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Box 3037 , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , NC 27710 Communicated by Anthony S. Fauci , October 7 , 1992 ( received for review August 13 , 1992 ) ABSTRACT The long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) and the 5 regulatory region of the gene encoding the interleukin 2 receptor & subunit ( IL-2Ra ) share functional xB enhancer elements involved in the regulation of these inducible transcription units during T-cell activation .
These xB enhancer elements are recognized by a structurally related family of interactive proteins that includes p50 , p65 , and the product of the c-rel protooncogene ( c-Rel ) .
Recent biochemical studies have shown that p65 and p50 form the prototypical NF-B complex , which is rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell activation .
This intracellular signaling complex potently stimulates x B-directed transcription from either the HIV-1 LTR or the IL-2Ra promoter via the strong transactivation domain present in p65 .
We now demonstrate that nuclear expression of human c-Rel , which is induced by either phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor a with delayed kinetics relative to p65 , markedly represses p6S-mediated activation of these transcription units .
These inhibitory effects of c-Rel correlate with its DNA-binding activity but not with its ability to heterodimerize with p50 , suggesting that c-Rel inhibition involves competition with p50/p65 for occupancy of the « B enhancer element .
Together , these findings suggest that one function of c-Rel is as a physiologic repressor of the HIV-1 LTR and IL-2Ra pro-moters , serving to efficiently counter the strong transcriptional activating effects of p65 .
The NF- « B transcription factor ( 1-3 ) has been implicated in the transcriptional control of a variety of genes that are induced during T-cell activation , including those encoding the a subunit of the interleukin 2 receptor ( IL-2Ra ) ( 4 ) and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) ( 5 ) .
The expression of these transcription units can be triggered by multiple stimulants , including phorbol esters ( 2 , 4 ) , tumor necrosis factor a ( 6 , 7 ) , and the Tax protein of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) ( 8-10 ) .
These same activation agents also induce the nuclear expression of NF- « B , at least in part , through a posttranslational mechanism involving its dissociation from a cytoplasmic inhibitor ( s ) termed IkB ( 11-13 ) .
The active nuclear form of NF- « B is a heterodimeric complex composed of two DNA-binding subunits , termed p50 and p65 ( 14 ) .
Both of these subunits share extensive ( -300 amino acids ) N-terminal sequence homology with the c-rel protooncogene product ( c-Rel ) ( refs .
15-19 ; reviewed in ref .
20 ) .
Like p65 , c-Rel is present in nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes ( 21 , 22 ) , is capable of binding directly to the « kB enhancer ( 22 ) , and can associate with p50 ( 23 ) .
However , while p65 is expressed in the nucleus within minutes following T-cell activation with phorbol esters , the induced expression of nuclear c-Rel is largely delayed for The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

1023 several hours ( 21 ) .
Recent functional studies with cloned cDNAs encoding p50 and p65 have demonstrated that NF-kB exerts strong activating effects on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and IL-2Ra promoter principally through a potent transactivation domain located in the C-terminal portion of p65 ( 24-26 ) .
In this regard , c-Rel also appears to contain a C-terminal transactivation domain ( 27-30 ) ; however , this domain lacks homology with the corresponding functional domain present in p65 .
In this report , we provide evidence that p65 and c-Rel function as integral components of a counter-regulatory network of Rel-related transcription factors in human T lymphocytes .
Specifically , these two sequentially induced factors display striking differences in their ability to activate « B enhancer-mediated transcription from the HIV-1 LTR .
Further , when these Rel proteins are coexpressed , c-Rel markedly inhibits p6S5-activated transcription from either the HIV-1 LTR or the IL-2Ra promoter .
Mutational analyses indicate that this dominant repressor activity of c-Rel involves its DNA-binding function rather than dimerization properties .
Thus , in addition to its weak transcriptional activating effects , c-Rel also has the capacity to act as a specific inhibitor of nuclear p65 function .
As such , competition between these two Rel proteins at the xB enhancer site may constitute a dynamic mechanism for positive and negative regulation of NF- « B-directed transcription .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression Vectors .
All re/-related cDNAs were inserted into pCMV4 ( 31 ) downstream of the human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) immediate-early promoter .
The wild-type human c-Rel ( hc-Rel ) expression vector contained a full-length cDNA generated by RNA amplification ( 19 , 22 ) .
Nested C-terminal deletions of hc-Rel were produced by cloning truncated forms of this cDNA into a modified pCMV4 vector containing a universal translational terminator .
Plasmids denoted c-Rel ( 1-298 ) and c-Rel ( 1-289 ) were created by using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to introduce a translational termination codon after codons 298 and 289 , respectively .
Plasmids expressing the N-terminal deletion series c-Rel ( 33-587 ) , c-Rel ( 125-587 ) , c-Rel ( 184-587 ) , and c-Rel ( 291-587 ) were constructed by amplification with oligonucleotide primers that introduced a consensus translation initiation site ( 32 ) .
The human p50 expression plasmid was generated by inserting into Abbreviations : CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; hc-Rel , human c-Rel ; HIV-1 , type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ; HTLV-I , type I human T-cell leukemia virus ; IL-2Ra , interleukin 2 receptor a subunit ; LTR , long terminal repeat .

RESULTS Human p65 and c-Rel Exhibit Markedly Different « B-Specific Transcriptional Activating Properties .
To directly compare the transactivation potentials of p65 and c-Rel in human T lymphocytes , various amounts of pCMV4 expression plasmids encoding each of these proteins were transiently expressed in Jurkat T cells together with CAT reporter plasmids containing either the full-length HIV-1 LTR ( HIV-1 LTR-CAT ; Fig .

Consistent with prior reports ( 24-26 ) , p65 markedly induced transcription from both promoters ( 10- to 100-fold ) , even at low doses ( 1-2 ug ) of input effector plasmid .
In contrast , cotransfection with even higher doses ( 5 ug ) of the c-Rel expression vector failed to activate the HIV-1 LTR ( Fig .

- Relative transcriptional activities of p65 and c-Rel .
( 4 and B ) Jurkat T cells ( 5 x 10° ) were transfected with CAT reporter plasmids ( 2.5 ug ) containing either the full-length HIV-1 LTR ( HIV-1 LTR-CAT ) ( 4 ) or the HIV-1 enhancer ( « B-TATA-CAT ) ( B ) and various amounts of a c-Rel ( a ) or p65 ( m ) cDNA expression vector .
Input DNA concentration was held constant in all transfections by inclusion of the parental pCMV4 expression vector lacking a cDNA insert .
CAT activities were determined after 40 to 48 hr and are presented as fold induction relative to the basal levels measured in the absence of either effector plasmid .
Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments .
( C ) Expression plasmids ( 5 ug ) encoding wild-type c-Rel ( aa 1-587 ) or C-terminal deletion mutants truncated at aa 515 and 359 were cotransfected with the « B-TATA-CAT reporter plasmid into Jurkat cells .
Relative CAT activities were determined as indicated above .
( D and E ) Jurkat T cells ( 5 x 10° ) were cotransfected with HIV-1 LTR-CAT ( 2.5 ug ) and either a mixture of p50 ( 1 ug ) and p65 ( 2.5 ug ) expression vectors ( D ) or 2 ug of an HTLV-I Tax expression vector ( E ) along with various doses of plasmids encoding wild-type ( & ) or truncated forms ( aa 291-587 , o ; aa 1-515 , m ) of c-Rel .
CAT activities were determined after 48 hr of culture and are expressed as fold induction relative to basal levels measured in the absence of added effector .

Of note , deletion of the C-terminal 72 aa from the wild-type c-Rel protein , a subregion which overlaps sequences previously implicated in c-Rel-mediated transactivation ( 27 ) , virtually abolished these modest stimulatory effects on the HIV-1 « kB enhancer ( Fig .
1C ) .
Human c-Rel Represses p6S5-Mediated Transcription .
The distinct transactivation potentials and the previously described delayed nuclear appearance of c-Rel versus p65 DNA-binding activity ( 21 ) prompted investigation of whether c-Rel might negatively regulate p6S5-mediated transcriptional activation .
In this regard , immunoblotting studies of nuclear c-Rel and p65 expressed in Jurkat T cells stimulated with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( Fig .
24 ) or tumor necrosis factor a ( Fig .
2B ) clearly showed distinct but overlapping induction kinetics for these two Rel proteins .
To explore the potential functional consequences of the simultaneous expression of c-Rel and p65 , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with the HIV-1 LTR-CAT reporter , a mixture of p50 and p65 expression vectors , and various c-Rel constructs ( Fig .
1D ) .
In the absence of c-Rel , the NF- « B p50/p65 complex activated transcription from the HIV-1 LTR by ~9-fold over basal levels .
However , coexpression of c-Rel in these cells markedly repressed these stimulatory effects in a Biochemistry : Doerre et al .

Nuclear extracts ( 20 ug ) from these cells were fractionated by SDS/PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with c-Rel and p6S-specific anti-peptide antibodies as described ( see Materials and Methods ) .

Similar antagonistic effects were observed with a deletion mutant of c-Rel ( aa 1-515 ) lacking the C-terminal subregion required for its weak transactivation activity ( Fig .
1D ) .
However , selective removal of the Rel homology domain from the wild-type c-Rel protein yielded an efficiently expressed N-terminal deletion mutant ( aa 291-587 ; Fig .
1F ) that failed to inhibit NF- « B-mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR ( Fig .
LD ) .
These inhibitory effects of c-Rel on NF- « B-dependent transcription from the HIV-1 LTR were fully recapitulated in independent transfection experiments performed with an expression vector encoding the HTLV-I Tax protein ( Fig .
1E ) , which potently activates the nuclear expression of endogeneous p50/p65 heterodimers ( 8-10 ) .
To confirm the specificity of these biological effects , additional functional transfection studies were performed HTLV-I LTR 80 |B -317 IL-2Ro 601 a0 { Relative CAT Activity 20 { 1 HIV-1 LTR $ 00 3 -- -- -- -- Proc .

HTLV-I Tax-mediated activation of the IL-2Ra promoter , which requires NF- « B DNA binding events ( 8-10 ) , was inhibited > 80 % by coexpression with either wild-type c-Rel or the c-Rel ( 1-515 ) deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 72 aa ( Fig .
34 ) .
In contrast , Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR , which proceeds by an NF-xB-independent mechanism ( 39-41 ) , was not significantly inhibited by either c-Rel or c-Rel ( 1-515 ) ( Fig .
3B ) .
Similarly , xB-independent activation of the HIV-1 LTR by the HIV-1 Tat protein was not negatively affected by coexpression of either of these c-Rel proteins ( Fig .
3C ) .
Mutational Analysis of c-Rel Repressor Function .
To define more precisely which peptide sequences within c-Rel were required for its repressor activity , mutant c-re/ expression vectors encoding a series of N- or C-terminally truncated forms of the protein were prepared .
These mutants were first transiently expressed in Jurkat human T cells containing the HIV-1 LTR-CAT construct , with p65/pS50 as the activator ( Fig .
3 D and E ) .
In the absence of c-Rel , the HIV-1 LTR was activated 4- to S-fold by the cotransfected p50 and p65 expression vectors .
These NF- « xB-mediated stimulatory effects were completely inhibited by wild-type c-Rel ( aa 1-587 ) , as well as by a C-terminal deletion mutant of c-Rel containing aa 1-289 ( Fig .
3D ) .
However , removal of an additional 11 aa from this c-Rel mutant significantly impaired its ability to inhibit the NF- « B response , indicating that the C-terminal boundary of the involved functional domain ( s ) lies between aa 289 and 278 .
In reciprocal experiments with a series of N-terminal deletion mutants ( Fig .
removal of aa 1-32 from the full-length c-Rel protein proved sufficient to largely disrupt the wild-type inhibitory phenotype .
Together , these functional studies localized the domain ( s ) involved in c-Rel-mediated transcriptional repression between aa 1 and 289 , which corresponds with the Rel homology region .
The finding that the inhibitory effects exerted by c-Rel require the presence of sequences within its Rel homology domain suggested that the mechanism of repression might involve the DNA-binding properties of c-Rel .

CAT activities were determined after 40-48 hr of culture and are presented as fold induction relative to basal levels measured in the absence of the effector plasmids .

However , C-terminal truncations extending to either aa 278 or aa 263 ( lanes 8 and 9 ) completely disrupted this DNA binding function of c-Rel .
In reciprocal studies , N-terminal deletion mutants truncated at aa 33 and 125 were examined , and both were found to lack binding to the xB enhancer probe ( lanes 10 and 11 ) .

USA 90 ( 1993 ) c-Rel sequences required for repression of p65-induced transcription ( Fig .
3 ) .
The Rel homology domain not only contains a DNA-binding motif but also sequences that mediate oligomeriza-tion with other Rel-related proteins ( 20 ) , including the formation of heterodimers with p50 ( 15-18 , 23 ) .
To examine whether c-Rel-mediated repression of p65 activation might involve competition for heterodimer formation with p50 , a series of six c-Rel deletion mutants were translated in vitro by using rabbit reticulocyte lysate either alone or in combination with p50 .
Immunoprecipitation analyses performed with S-labeled lysates confirmed that when translated alone , each c-Rel mutant was efficiently expressed ( Fig .
4C , lanes 1-6 ) and lacked reactivity with pS5Q-specific antiserum ( lanes 7-12 ) .
However , when cotranslated with p50 , the 1-359 and 1-278 C-terminal truncations and the 33-587 and 125-587 N-terminal truncations of c-Rel formed heteromeric complexes with p50 , as evidenced by their coimmunoprecipita-tion with anti-p50 antiserum ( lanes 13 , 14 , 16 , and 17 ) .

Deletion mapping of the c-Rel DNA-binding and dimerization domains .
( 4 and B ) COS cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding either wild-type c-Rel ( lane 1 ) or the indicated N- and C-terminal deletion mutants and were metabolically radiolabeled after 48 hr with teine .
Recipient cell lysates ( 1 ul ) were allowed to bind and then crosslinked to a -labeled xB enhancer probe .
Immunoprecipitation was then performed with c-Rel-specific antiserum raised against aa 132-150 ( A ) .
Relative levels of expression of c-Rel deletion mutants defective in DNA binding ( lanes 8-11 of A ) were analyzed by immunoprecipitation analysis of **S-labeled lysates ( 100 ul ) in the absence of radiolabeled DNA ( B , lanes 1-4 ) .
( C ) Run-off transcripts encoding the indicated C- and N-terminal deletion mutants of c-Rel were translated in vitro in either the absence ( lanes 1-12 ) or the presence ( lanes 13-18 ) of p50 transcripts .
Programmed lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with either c-Rel-specific ( lanes 1-6 ) or pSQ-specific ( lanes 7-18 ) antiserum and analyzed by SDS/PAGE .

ization domain of c-Rel are located between aa 125 and 278 .
As such , these experiments specifically identify a class of c-Rel mutants , including c-Rel ( 1-278 ) ( lane 14 ) and c-Rel ( 33-587 ) ( lane 16 ) , which retain the ability to dimerize with p50 yet fail to repress NF- « x B-dependent transcription ( see Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , the c-Rel subregion involved in heterodimer formation with p50 appears to be distinct from the functional domains required for both transcriptional repression and « B-specific DNA binding ( aa 1-289 ) .
DISCUSSION Prior DNA-protein crosslinking studies with phorbol ester-activated Jurkat cells have suggested that p65 ( early ) and c-Rel ( late ) are expressed with distinct but overlapping kinetics during the course of T-cell activation ( 21 ) .
Consistent with these prior studies , immunoblotting experiments revealed a similar delayed pattern of nuclear c-Rel expression relative to p65 following treatment of Jurkat T cells with tumor necrosis factor a .
Based on these findings , in vivo transient transfection studies were performed to directly compare the transcriptional activities of these two Rel family members .
Our results indicate that while p65 is a potent activator of both the HIV-1 LTR and a synthetic HIV-1 enhancer-CAT construct , c-Rel fails to activate the HIV-1 LTR and produces at least 10-fold weaker activating effects on the synthetic « xB reporter plasmid .
Further , when these transcription factors are coexpressed , c-Rel markedly represses the strong activating effects of p65 on the HIV-1 LTR .
These inhibitory effects of c-Rel are not dependent on its unique C-terminal sequences ( 20 ) but instead are correlated with sequences in the Rel homology segment that mediate DNA binding .
In contrast , analyses of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of c-Rel clearly segregated repression from the overlapping but distinct dimerization domain within c-Rel .
Together , these findings suggest that c-Rel represses NF- « B-dependent transcription through interference with p65 binding to the « B enhancer .
These findings thus highlight the apparently opposing functions of two Rel family members which are differentially induced during T-cell activation .
In addition to its repressive properties , c-Rel may also positively regulate the expression of select cellular genes , perhaps including those whose protein products are required in the later phases of the T-cell activation process .
In this regard , it has been shown that c-Rel contains a relatively weak transcriptional activation domain that is functional in several cell types ( 26-30 ) , including human T lymphocytes ( Fig .
1 ) .
The precise factors that determine whether a specific xB enhancer-containing transcription unit will be positively or negatively regulated by c-Rel remain unclear .
It is possible that subtle sequence variations in the « B enhancer motif , or associated promoter elements , may dictate the functional consequences of c-Rel binding to a given target gene ( 42 , 43 ) .
As well , the cellular context in which c-Rel acts could have important effects on its ultimate function .
For example , v-Rel , the oncogenic counterpart of c-Rel , exerts strikingly different functional effects on « B-directed transcription , dependent upon the state of cellular differentiation ( 44 ) .
