ICSAT is structurally most closely related to the previously cloned ICSBP , a member of the IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) family of proteins that binds to interferon consensus sequences ( ICSs ) found in many promoters of the IFN-regulated genes .
Among T-cell lines investigated , ICSAT was abundantly expressed in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -infected T cells .
When the HTLV-1 fax gene was expressed or phorbol myristate acetate-A23187 stimulation was used , ICSAT expression was induced in Jurkat cells which otherwise do not express ICSAT .
When the binding of ICSAT to four different ICSs was tested , the relative differences in binding affinities for those ICSs were determined .
To study the functional role of ICSAT , we performed cotransfection experiments with the human embryonal carcinoma cell line N-Tera2 .
ICSAT was demonstrated to possess repressive function over the gene activation induced by IFN stimulation or by IRF-1 cotransfection .
Such repressive function is similar to that seen in IRF-2 or ICSBP .
However , we have found that ICSAT has a different repressive effect from that of IRF-2 or ICSBP in some IFN-responsive reporter constructs .
These results suggest that a novel mechanism of gene regulation by `` differential repression '' is used by the multiple members of repressor proteins with different repressive effects on the IFN-responsive genes .
Interferons ( IFNs ) are multifunctional biomodulators that regulate the genes involved in defense against viral infection , modulation of cell growth , and activation of the immune system ( 48 , 55 , 57 , 60 , 73 ) .
Promoters that respond to IFNs have consensus DNA-binding sites , which were originally called interferon consensus sequences ( ICS ) .
They are also known as IFN stimulation-responsive elements , or IFN-responsive ele-ments .
These are the elements to which activators bind and through which gene expressions are enhanced ( 7 , 25 , 30 , 47 , 64 , 67 ) .
Three transcription factors have so far been found to transactivate the genes through ICSs .
The first , IFN regulatory factor type 1 ( IRF-1 ) , is the transcription factor that was originally found to transactivate the IFN-B gene promoter ( 39 ) .
IRF-1 enhances gene expression through binding to the IRF-binding sites , which are found in the promoters of the IRF-1-respon-sive genes ( 4 , 21 , 39 , 54 ) .
The next transactivating molecule is a complex called ISGF3 , which is induced upon IFN- « and -B stimulation ( 10 , 15 , 26 , 39 , 59 , 63 ) .
ISGF3 consists of three distinct protein components , termed STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 ( 13 , 26 , 51 , 58 , 71 ) .
STAT1 includes two alternatively spliced forms of 91 kDa ( STAT1 « ) and 84 kDa ( STAT1B ) , and either is capable of ISGF3 formation ( 42 ) .

1283 tion , STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated to form a het-erodimer , to which p48 is combined to form the complete form of the ISGF3 complex ( 14 , 26 , 29 ) .
ISGF3 binds to ICSs found in promoters of most IFN- « /B-responsive genes ( 50 , 53 , 56 ) and transactivates the genes upon IFN- « /f stimulation .
IFN-y activation factor ( GAF ) is the third transactivating molecule , and its formation is induced by phosphorylation of Tyr-701 of STAT1la by IFN-y stimulation ( 10 , 42 , 63 ) .
The phosphorylated forms of STAT1a « dimerize through reciprocal SH2-do-main-phosphotyrosine interactions to form GAF ( 62 ) .
GAF binds to the site called gamma-activated sequences ( GAS ) and transactivates the genes harboring the GAS site upon IFN-y stimulation ( 4 , 9 , 49 ) .
Besides these transactivators , there are two other transcription factors , termed IRF-2 and IFN consensus sequence-binding protein ( ICSBP ) , that are structurally similar to but functionally different from IRF-1 .
These two factors are known to repress the effect of the transactivators described above ( 20 , 43 ) .
For instance , IRF-2 represses the IRF-1-mediated induction of several genes such as IFN- and major histocompatibility complex class I genes ( 20 , 22 ) .
IRF-2 is > 60 % identical to IRF-1 in the amino acid sequence of its N-terminal putative DNA-binding domain and therefore represses the effect of IRF-1 , probably through competing with IRF-1 for binding to its recognition sequences ( 66 ) .
ICSBP is another member of the transcription factor family that is similar to IRF-1 and IRF-2 in its N-terminal domain ( 16 , 72 ) .
It is known that ICSBP also represses the gene expression induced by IRF-1 or IFNs ( 43 , 72 ) .
However , although ICSBP is structur- 1284 YAMAGATA ET AL .
ally similar to IRF-2 , the molecular mechanism of the gene repression by ICSBP is less clear .
The DNA-binding property of ICSBP suggests binding competition with activators ( 16 , 43 ) , while ICSBP is demonstrated to form specific complexes with IRF-1 or IRF-2 through direct protein-protein interactions , suggesting a novel , as yet unknown mechanism of gene repression ( 3 , 61 ) .
The existence of the multiple activator and repressor proteins in gene regulation may be important for the coordinated expression-regulation of the IFN-regulated genes .
Also , there may presumably be several other IRF family transcription factors that have not yet been identified .
Here we report the molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding a novel IRF family transcription factor called ICSAT .
ICSAT is structurally most closely related to ICSBP , and its N-terminal portion shows high homology with that of other members of the IRF family proteins .
It is frequently expressed in adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) cell lines and can be induced upon T-cell activation .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) demonstrates that ICSAT directly binds to ICSs .
When expressed in human embryonal carcinoma cells , ICSAT functions as a negative regulatory transcription factor .
However , its repressive effect is somewhat different from that of IRF-2 or ICSBP .
This finding implies a mechanism of gene regulation through differential repression that is brought by the multiple repressor proteins .
Our study revealed the novel aspect of Pip/LSIRF , the mouse homolog of ICSAT ( 12 , 35 ) .

COS cells and N-Tera2 cells ( 1 ) , a gift from P. Andrews , were maintained at 37°C under 5 % CO ; in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and penicillin ( 100 U/ml ) .
For IFN treatment , cells were exposed to human natural IFN- « ( 500 U/ml ; kindly provided by Sumitomo Pharmacy ) or recombinant IFN-y ( 100 U/ml ; kindly provided by Shionogi Laboratories ) for 36 h before being harvested .
Plasmids and oligonucleotides .
The ICSAT expression plasmid ( pSSRe-IC-SAT ) was constructed by inserting a 2.0-kb fragment containing the entire coding sequence of ICSAT into the filled EcoRI site of the expression vector pSSRa ( 70 ) .
The cDNA fragments of IRF-1 , IRF-2 , and ICSBP were excised from pAct-1 and pAct-2 ( 22 ) ( both donated by T. Taniguchi ) and pMVL3.2 ( 72 ) ( a gift of B.-Z .
Levi ) .
They were similarly subcloned into pSSRa to generate pSSRa-IRF1 , pSSRa-IRF2 , and pSSRa-ICSBP , respectively .
For the luciferase reporter constructs , pIFNB ( -125 ) -Luci was constructed by inserting a Se/fl-HindIl fragment excised from p-125cat , which contains the -125-bp promoter region of the human IFN gene ( 22 ) , into the site of pUCO0O-Luci ( 23 ) .

pGBP ( -216 ) -Luci was constructed by inserting the Secl-Pvull fragment excised from pUCooLuci , which contains the coding sequence of firefly luciferase , into the same site of GBP-CAT ( a gift from T. Decker ) , which contains the -216 to +19 region of the human GBP-7 gene .
For the heterologous promoter-reporter constructs harboring ICSs , two tandem copies of each ICS were subcloned into the BamHI site of tk-Luci ( 68 ) to generate 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) -tk-Luci , 2 ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci , and 2X ( GAS ) -tk-Luci , respectively .
The sequences of ICSs are the same as those used in EMSA as probes or competitors .
Those sequences are 5'-AAGTACTTTCAGTITCAT ATT-3 ' ( GBP-ISRE ) , 5-AGCCCTTTCCCTITTTGGCITTTAGCITTCGG-3 ' ( ISG 15-ISRE ) , 5-CAGTTITTCATATTACTCTAAAT-3 ' ( GAS ) , 5-TCACTTTCAC TTTCACTIT-3 ' ( C13 ) , and 5 % -GGCATTCTCTATCTGATTGTT-3 ' ( GATA ) .

sequence highly homologous to the IRF family transcription factor ICSBP .
Using this fragment as a probe , we screened an oligo ( dT ) -primed cDNA library of ATL-16T to obtain the full-length cDNA .
Among the 900,000 independent plaques screened , 7 positive clones were isolated .
The three largest colinear fragments of the 5.1-kb cDNA were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis .
These clones shared an open reading frame ( ORF ) of 1,350 bp at the 5 ' portion of the cDNA that potentially encodes a protein of 450 amino acid residues and a predicted molecular mass of 51.6 kDa .
The cDNA size of 5.1 kb was compatible with the size of mRNA detected in Northern blot analysis ( see Fig .
2 ) .
In addition , these three clones have almost identical 5 ends .
Therefore , we believe that these are the full-length cDNAs .
Although no in-frame stop codon was found upstream , the ATG at nucleotide 96 is likely to be a translation initiation codon for the following two reasons .
( i ) The sequence surrounding the first methionine is consistent with the consensus translation initiation sequence of Kozak ( 27 , 28 ) .
( ii ) The cDNA obtained seemed to be a full-length one , and this ATG is the first methionine of a single ORF .
However , there is another in-frame ATG at nucleotide 135 , and it is possible that this serves as an alternative translation initiation codon .
The database search with the final deduced amino acid sequence revealed that this cDNA encodes a novel protein .
The homology search analysis revealed that this protein is most closely related to ICSBP .
We have named this protein ICSAT ( inter-feron consensus sequence-binding protein in adult T-cell leukemia [ or activated T cells ] ) ( see below ) .
However , during the preparation of the manuscript , two other groups reported the cloning of Pip/LSIRF , which represents the mouse homolog of ICSAT ( 12 , 35 ) ( Fig .
1A ) .
The N-terminal portion of ICSAT demonstrates significant homology with the corresponding portions of four IRFs , ICSBP , p48 , IRF-2 , and IRF-1 ( 77.6 , 49.6 , 41.1 , and 38.8 % identity , respectively ) .
This portion is known to serve as a DNA-binding domain in these family members , and it is thus conceivable that ICSAT interacts with DNA via this putative DNA-binding domain .
There are proline-rich ( amino acids 151 to 199 ) and glutamine-rich ( amino acids 361 to 418 ) domains , both of which are known to possess transactivation potential ( Fig .
1B ) ( 8 , 38 ) .
To confirm that the cDNA clone obtained actually encodes the protein predicted , we subcloned the cDNA fragment into an expression vector , pSSRa , and transfected it into COS cells .

ICSAT expression in hematopoietic cell lines .
RNA from ATL-16T cells served as a positive control .
Ethidium bromide staining of the electrophoresed gel is shown below .
Triangles indicate the positions of 28 $ and 188 rRNA .
The lysate of the transfected cells was subjected to SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) and immunoblotted with antiserum raised against ICSAT .
The antiserum was raised against the middle portion of ICSAT , which is not conserved among the IRF family proteins , and therefore will avoid cross-reactions between ICSAT and the other members of the IRF family ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The expressed ICSAT protein was detected as a single band at around 51 kDa ( Fig .
1C ) , which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass .
This indicates that the cDNA is correctly expressed and can be used for further functional analyses .
ICSAT is expressed in lymphoid tissues .
Northern analysis of mouse tissues showed that ICSAT is expressed in the thymus and much more in the spleen ( data not shown ) .
The exclusive expression of ICSAT in lymphoid tissues prompted us to investigate its expression pattern in hematopoietic cells .
We then performed Northern analysis of various human hematopoietic cell lines .
We detected the 5.1-kb mRNA of ICSAT in some of the B-cell lines ( RAMOS and BALL-1 ) and peripheral lymphocytes ( HLCL ) but not in T-cell lines ( T-ALL-1 , CCRF-CEM , PEER , MOLT-3 , and SKW3 ) , myeloid cell lines ( K562 , HL60 , and JOSK-k ) , erythroid cell lines ( KU812 and HEL ) , or monocytic cell line ( U937 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
These results demonstrate that ICSAT is expressed in the cell lines of B-cell origin .
This finding is consistent with the result of the tissue distribution pattern since B cells are much more abundant in the spleen than in the thymus .
In the Northern blots , no band of alternative size was detected , suggesting that there is no alternative form of mRNA .
ICSAT is expressed in ATL cells and can be induced by transfecting the fax gene or stimulating with PMA-A23187 .
It is intriguing that ICSAT is almost undetectable in five of the T-cell lines examined but abundantly expressed in ATL-16T cells , which are also of T-cell origin .
This fact prompted us to investigate the expression level of ICSAT in other ATL-derived cell lines .
Northern blot analysis was performed with three other ATL-derived cell lines ATL-2 , ATL-35 , and ED40810 , in addition to ATL-16T ( 45 ) .
Interestingly , ATL-2 , Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
ATL-35 , and ED40810 cells expressed ICSAT mRNA in an amount similar to that expressed by ATL-16T cells ( Fig .
3A ) .
It should be noted that ICSAT was abundantly expressed in all four ATL-derived cell lines examined but was below the detection level in five other T-cell lines .
This fact suggests that human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infection could be responsible for the enhanced expression of ICSAT in ATL-derived cell lines .
HTLV-1 is the retrovirus that causes ATL ( 5 ) .
This virus codes for the specific protein called Tax , which is known to stimulate transcription of several genes through interacting with host cellular transcription factors ( 17 , 24 , 40 , 52 ) .
Therefore , the enhanced expression of ICSAT in ATL-derived cell lines may be attributed to the presence of the Tax protein .
To test this hypothesis , we transfected Jurkat cells with transient Tax expression vector ( pCG-Tax ) and prepared mRNA from the transfected cells .
However , Northern blot analysis could not detect the mRNA of ICSAT ( data not shown ) .
We then performed nested RT-PCR with specific primers for ICSAT and subjected the products to agarose gel electrophoresis .
PCR products from the mRNA of ATL-16T cells or Jurkat cells treated with PMA-A23187 ( see below ) exhibited a single 436-bp band that is exactly the expected size of the PCR product ( Fig .
3B ) .
Interestingly , the same 436-bp band was also observed in the PCR products from Jurkat cells transfected with pCG-Tax , although the band is less intense than that of ATL-16T or Jurkat cells treated with PMA-A23187 .
No band was observed in nontransfected Jurkat cells or Jurkat cells transfected with vector construct alone .
Considering that the transfection efficiency of the DEAE-dextran method is extremely low ( less than 1 % ) , it is reasonable that the induction of ICSAT was detected only in RT-PCR but not in Northern analysis .
These results suggest that the expression of ICSAT is enhanced by Tax in Jurkat cells , a non-ATL cell line , and provide one possible mechanism of enhanced ICSAT-expres-sion in ATL-derived cells .
The induction of ICSAT expression by Tax prompted us to investigate whether any other stimulation of T cells results in ICSAT induction .
The T-cell activation signal through the T-cell receptor can be mimicked by treatment with PMA and the calcium ionophore A23187 ( 34 , 41 ) .
We therefore examined whether ICSAT is induced upon PMA-A23187 stimulation .
Jurkat cells were treated with PMA-A23187 for the indicated times , and mRNAs were subjected to Northern analysis ( Fig .
3C ) .
ICSAT expression was transiently induced upon PMA-A23187 stimulation and is most highly induced after 10 h. Continuous treatment for 24 h results in a decrease of expression down to the pretreated level .
These results indicate that ICSAT is transiently induced upon PMA-A23187 stimulation .
ICSAT directly binds to ICSs .
The N-terminal portion of ICSAT is highly homologous to those of the other members of the IRF family of transcription factors .
This family is known to interact with DNA through this conserved N-terminal portion .
To study the DNA-binding property of ICSAT , we performed EMSA with various ICSs .
The full-length ICSAT was expressed as a GST fusion protein , and the binding to the C13 oligonucleotide probe was examined .
The C13 oligonucleotide has been demonstrated to interact with IRF-1 and contains the consensus recognition sequences for both IRF-1 and IRF-2 ( 51 , 53 ) .
The shifted band with GST-ICSAT was observed , while no band was detected with GST alone ( Fig .
4A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
This band was canceled by addition of 60-fold molar excess of the same cold C13 oligonucleotides ( lane 3 ) .
Challenging with the 60-fold molar excess of unrelated oligonucleotides , which contain the consensus binding sequence for the GATA-binding family proteins ( 74 ) , had no effect on the Vou .

When the same molar excess of ISG15-ISRE oligonucleotides , to which the ISGF3 complex is known to bind ( 71 ) , was added , the binding was completely canceled ( lane 5 ) .
A similar experiment with GBP-ISRE ( 31 ) oligonucleotides also led to inhibition of the binding ( lane 6 ) .
However , the binding was not inhibited when GAS oligonucleotides , to which STAT1a is known to bind , were added ( lane 7 ) .
These results indicate that ICSAT binds directly to DNA and recognizes some of the IFN consensus sequences .
We next performed EMSA with the GBP-ISRE oligonucleotide as a probe , and the bindings were challenged with the cold oligonucleotides ( Fig .
4B ) .
The shifted band was also observed with the GBP-ISRE probe , confirming the result of the former experiment ( lane 2 ) .
In the presence of a 60 M excess of the cold ISG15-ISRE oligonucleotides , this binding was almost , but not totally , canceled ( lane 5 ) .
When a 60-fold molar excess of the C13 oligonucleotides was added , the binding was slightly inhibited ( lane 6 ) .
Again , the GAS oligonucleotides had no effect on binding ( lane 7 ) .

DNA-binding property of ICSAT .
( A and B ) Bacteria containing the pGEX-3X vector ( lanes 1 ) or pGEX-ICSAT-full ( lanes 2 to 7 ) were induced with IPTG , and the lysates were subjected to EMSA analyses with the C13 probe ( A ) or GBP-ISRE probe ( B ) .
The bindings were challenged with a 60-fold molar excess of the cold competitors indicated above each lane .
The sequences of the competitors are also shown in Materials and Methods .
( C ) DNA-binding property of the native ICSAT .
Nuclear extract from ATL-16T cells was subjected to EMSA with the ISG15-ISRE probe ( lane 1 to 3 ) .
Preimmune ( lane 2 ) or immune ( lane 3 ) serum raised against the specific portion of ICSAT was added to verify the DNA binding of ICSAT .
EMSA experiments , the relative order of binding affinities for these four sequences in vitro can be deduced .
ICSAT binds most strongly to GBP-ISRE , moderately to ISG15-ISRE , weakly to C13 , and almost not at all to GAS .
Finally , the DNA binding of the native ICSAT was confirmed by using the nuclear extract from ATL-16T cells .
The shifted band was observed in an EMSA experiment with the ISG15-ISRE probe and ATL-16T nuclear extract ( Fig .
4C , lane 1 ) .
When the antiserum raised against ICSAT was added , the intensity of the protein-DNA complex was weakened and the supershifted complex appeared ( lane 3 ) .
This indicates that the lower shifted band contains the ICSAT-DNA complex , which is recognized by anti-ICSAT serum .
The remaining protein-DNA complex ( lane 3 ) indicates the existence of proteins other than ICSAT which recognize the ISG15-ISRE sequence .
Addition of preimmune serum had no effect ( lane 2 ) .
From these results , we concluded that ICSAT has DNA-binding ability and that there are some preferences for its recognition sequences among the ICSs .
ICSAT represses the effect of IRF-1 .
Since ICSAT has the potential to bind to ICSs , we investigated its effect on various promoters harboring ICSs .
A number of cotransfection experiments were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with N-Tera2 cells ( 1 ) .
N-Tera2 cells were chosen because in the previous study , they were demonstrated to express very low levels of intrinsic IRF family transcription factors and were thus considered to be suitable for investigating the function of IFN-regulatory proteins ( 43 ) .
We performed an initial experiment by cotransfecting the cells with pSSR « -ICSAT and either pIFNB ( -125 ) -Luci or pH-2L @ ( -392 ) -Luci ( Fig .
5A ) .
Cotransfection experiments with pSSRa-IRF1 and either pIFNB ( -125 ) -Luci or pH-2L @ ( -392 ) -Luci were also performed as a positive control , because both of the promoters were demonstrated to be activated by IRF-1 ( 22 , 39 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5B , ICSAT did not transactivate these promoters whereas IRF-1 transactivated both of them .
Taking into consideration that ICSAT is most homologous to ICSBP , which is known to act as a repressor , it is possible that ICSAT acts as a trans-repressor for these promoters as well .
To test this hypothesis , we performed triple-cotransfection experiments with pSSRa-IRF1 , pSSRa-ICSAT , and either of the reporter constructs .
IRF-1 activates these genes , and the repressive effect of ICSAT on the activated genes could be examined .
The results were summarized in Fig .
5C and D. Cotransfection of IRF-1 alone transactivated IFNB ( -125 ) -Luci up to eightfold the basal level of activity .
However , when ICSAT was present , the luciferase activity was reduced to less than one-third of that of IRF-1 alone ( Fig .
5C ) .
The result with pH-2L @ ( -392 ) -Luci was essentially the same as with pIFNB ( -125 ) -Luci .
ICSAT repressed the promoter activity driven by IRF-1 down to less than one-fourth that of the basal level ( Fig .
5D ) .
In addition to the newly isolated ICSAT , two other repressors interact with ICSs ( IRF-2 and ICSBP ) .
The presence of three different molecules with the same biological function suggests a complexed network system of the IFN-regulated genes .
To compare the effects of the three repressors , we carried out the cotransfection experiments with IRF-2 or ICSBP as well .
Both of the effectors were subcloned into the same pSSRa expression vector to equalize the expression level and to compare their repressive effects .
As previously demonstrated ( 20 , 43 ) , both IRF-2 and ICSBP suppressed the effect of IRF-1 ( Fig .
5C and D ) .
When compared with them , the repressive effect of ICSAT was indistinguishable from that of IRF-2 or ICSBP for both IFN-B and the promoter .
These experiments demonstrate that ICSAT represses the transactivational effect of IRF-1 and that it acts as a repressor for these genes .
Different repressive effects of ICSAT on reporters activated by IFN-a stimulation .

Effect of ICSAT on the promoters activated by IRF-1 .

The positions and sequences of ICSs on each promoter construct are shown .
( B ) ICSAT does not activate the promoters harboring ICSs activated by IRF-1 .
( C and D ) ICSAT represses the -induced transactivation of IFNB ( -125 ) -Luci ( C ) and ( D ) .
N-Tera2 cells were cotransfected with 5 pg of reporter construct and 2.5 ug of each expression construct .

on IFN- « stimulation , which also activates some of the IFN-regulated genes .
The same experiments were performed with constructs of 2'-5'0OAS ( -159 ) and H-2L @ ( -392 ) promoters fused to luciferase cDNA ( Fig .
5A ) .
IFN- « stimulation is known to enhance the activity of these promoters .
IFN- « activated the 2'-5'OAS ( -159 ) promoter up to 12-fold higher than the basal activity .
When ICSAT was coexpressed , however , the enhanced activity was repressed almost to the basal level ( Fig .
6A ) .
The repressive effects of the other two repressors were also compared .
Three repressors exerted identical effects on IFN-o-mediated activation of the 2'-5'0OA¥AS ( -159 ) promoter .
The result for the H-2L° ( -392 ) promoter was essentially similar to that for the 2-5 promoter ( Fig .
6B ) .
These results indicate that ICSAT represses the gene activation by IFN- « stimulation and that its effect seems indistinguishable from that of IRF-2 or ICSBP .
We next examined the effect on 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) - or 2X ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci , the two tandem repeats of GBP-ISRE or ISG15-ISRE fused to tk-Luci ( see Fig .
8A ) .
As with the results above , three repressors showed a negative effect on the 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) -tk response to IFN- « stimulation ( Fig .
6C ) .
Similarly , IRF-2 or ICSBP repressed the 2X ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci activation by IFN- « , which is in consistent with the result of a previous study ( 43 ) .
Surprisingly however , ICSAT , which was expected to exert the same function , had no effect on 2 % ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci activation by IFN- « .
This nonrepressive effect of ICSAT on ISG15-ISRE was further confirmed by a dose dependence test of ICSAT and two other repressors ( Fig .
6D ) .
The 2 % ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci activation by IFN- « was repressed by 3 pg of IRF-2 or ICSBP , and the repressed activity was restored as the ratio of ICSAT increases .
These results suggest that even while having the same repressive function as IRF-2 or ICSBP , ICSAT behaves somewhat differently from the other two repressors .

Repressive effect of ICSAT on genes activated by IFN-a stimulation .
( A to C ) N-Tera2 cells were cotransfected with 5 ug of p2'-5'0AS ( -159 ) -Luci ( A ) , pH-2L @ ( -392 ) -Luci ( B ) , 2 ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci or 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) -tk-Luci ( C ) , and 3 pg of each expression plasmid indicated .
The cells were incubated for 12 h and subsequently treated with or without IFN-a for 36 h. ( D ) 2 ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci ( 5 mg ) was cotransfected with 3 pg of expression plasmids .
The amount of the expression plasmids , ICSAT plus IRF-2 or ICSAT plus ICSBP , was maintained at 3 ug .
However , the contents of 3 ug vary , as shown .
The cells were incubated for 12 h and subsequently treated with IFN-a for 36 h or left untreated .
For all the experiments , each luciferase activity was adjusted for each protein concentration .
Values are the means of three independent experiments , with bars representing the standard deviations .
The repressive effect of ICSAT on IFN-y stimulation correlates with its ability to bind to ICSs .
Finally , we investigated the effect of ICSAT on IFN-y stimulations .
For reporter constructs of IFN-y stimulation , we used pGBP ( -216 ) -Luci and p2'-5 '' O0AS ( -159 ) -Luci , both of which respond to IFN-y ( 2 , 31 ) .
The promoter activated by IFN-y stimulation was again repressed by cotransfecting the pSSRa-ICSAT for both of the promoters , indicating that ICSAT can also repress the IFN-y-mediated gene activation ( Fig .
7 ) .
The responsiveness of the native GBP gene promoter to IFN-y has been extensively studied , and the critical element within the promoter that mediates the IFN-y-induced signal had been identified as two overlapping elements called GBP-ISRE and GAS ( Fig .
5A ) ( 9 , 31 ) .
GBP-ISRE and GAS ele- ments act independently in mediating IFN-y-dependent transactivation and together lead to a strong response of the native GBP promoter ( 31 ) .
To determine which of the two IFN-y-responsive elements mediates the repressive effect of ICSAT , we constructed 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) -tk-Luci and 2 % Luci , the two repeats of GBP-ISRE or GAS sequences fused to tk-Luci , respectively ( Fig .
8A ) .
These reporter plasmids were transfected into N-Tera2 cells with or without ICSAT , and the cells were stimulated with IFN-y .
Both of the reporter constructs were activated by IFN-y stimulation ( Fig .
8B ) .
However , in the presence of ICSAT , 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) -tk-Luci activity was strongly repressed , to less than one-fifth , while 2X ( GAS ) -tk-Luci activity was not suppressed at all .
These results indicate that the repressive effect of ICSAT on native Vou .

ICSAT represses the genes activated by IFN-y stimulation .
N-Tera2 cells were cotransfected with 2.5 pg of effector plasmid and 5 jg of pGBP ( -216 ) -Luci ( A ) or p2'-5'OAS ( -159 ) -Luci ( B ) for 12 h. Subsequently , the cells were treated with or without IFN-y for 36 h and subjected to the luciferase assay .
Each luciferase activity was adjusted for each protein concentration .
Values are the means of three independent experiments , with bars representing the standard deviations .
GBP ( -216 ) promoter is mediated through GBP but not through the GAS element .
This finding is consistent with the result of EMSA ( Fig .
4B ) in which ICSAT binds to GBP -ISRE but not to GAS oligonucleotide .
Again , this fact supports the idea that the repressive effect of ICSAT is mediated by the direct binding of ICSAT to the target sequences .
To get further evidence in support of this idea , we examined the repressive effect on the ISG15-ISRE element , because ICSAT binds to this element as well ( Fig .
4 ) .
We stimulated 2x ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci with IFN-y and examined the effect of ICSAT .
As expected from the EMSA result shown in Fig .
4 , ICSAT repressed 2 % ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci activated by IFN-y ( Fig .
8B ) .
Therefore , we concluded that the repressive effect of ICSAT is associated with its DNA binding to the target sequences .

Repressive effect of ICSAT correlates its binding to the ICSs .

provide ICSAT with a DNA-binding ability strong enough to be detected by EMSA , whereas the DNA binding of ICSBP has not been detected by EMSA but only by the Southwestern system ( 11 , 72 ) .
Another different point is that ICSAT has a proline-rich domain ( amino acids 151 to 199 ) that is not found in ICSBP ( Fig .
1D ) .
Although the proline-rich domain is known to possess transactivational potential ( 38 ) , the study of Drosophila Even-skipped protein showed that this domain functions as a repressor domain ( 18 ) and thus may explain the repressive effect of ICSAT .
There is a glutamine-rich domain near the C-terminal portion in both ICSAT and ICSBP that is also known as a transactivational domain ( 8 ) .
However , cotransfection experiments revealed that both proteins act as a repressor rather than an activator .
The reason for this discrepancy is unknown .
As predicted from the amino acid sequence analysis , direct DNA binding of ICSAT , probably through its N-terminal por-tion , was demonstrated by EMSA ( Fig .
4 ) .
Its binding seems specific to ICSs because the binding was not inhibited by addition of the unrelated oligonucleotides .
Moreover , the further binding inhibition experiments revealed that ICSAT has different relative affinities for the four different ICSs tested .
It is surprising that the addition of the GAS oligonucleotide did not inhibit the binding of ICSAT to the C13 or GBP-ISRE probe .
This finding indicates that ICSAT does not interact with GAS .
Indeed , no shifted band was observed by EMSA with labeled GAS probe ( data not shown ) .
The 5 '' half of the GAS oligonucleotide is identical to the 3 ' half of the GBP-ISRE oligonucleotide ( CAGTTTCATATTA ) , and GAS contains a sequence that is almost identical to those repeated in the C13 sequence except for one G at CAGTTT .
These facts suggest that the bindings of ICSAT to ICSs are strictly determined , even by a single nucleotide .
Although the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional activation have been extensively studied , only recently has repression been focused on as an important mode of gene regulation .
A few repressor proteins have been well characterized .
From their repressive mechanisms , they are classified into two groups .
One is composed of those which utilize a sequence-specific DNA-binding function to direct target selection , such as WT1 , AML1 , and Drosophila Kriippel , Engrailed , and Even-skipped ( 18 , 19 , 32 , 33 , 69 ) .
The other group contains those which lack DNA-binding ability but utilize protein-protein interaction to direct their repressive functions , such as Dr1 , NC1 , NC2 , and Msx-1 ( 6 , 23 , 36 , 37 ) .
Our cotransfection experiments revealed that ICSAT acts as a frans-repressor to the IFN-responsive genes .
The native promoters tested contain ICSs to which transactivating molecules bind .
Together with the results of the EMSA experiments , therefore , the mechanism of inhibition by ICSAT is speculated to be the competition with transactivating molecules for the sequences they rec-ognize .
This speculation is supported by the results with the heterologous promoter , in which repression correlates with its binding to the ICSs ( Fig .
4 and 8B ) .
This mechanism of repression is the same as that proposed for IRF-2 , which represses the gene activation by IRF-1 through direct binding competition ( 22 , 65 ) .
Another repressor , ICSBP , may also exert its repressive effect by interfering with the binding of activators ( 43 ) .
Recently , however , ICSBP was demonstrated to form heterodimers with IRF-1 or IRF-2 , suggesting a novel mechanism of gene repression ( 3 , 61 ) .
Whether ICSAT also forms heterodimers with other IRF family members remains to be studied .
From the cotransfection experiments , the repressive effect of ICSAT seems indistinguishable from those of the other two repressors .

repressed by IRF-2 or ICSBP .
What , then , is the significance of the three transcription factors of the same family with almost identical functions ?
One interesting finding is that ICSAT does not repress the IFN- « -mediated activation of 2 % ( ISG1S-ISRE ) -tk-Luci while IRF-2 or ICSBP represses it ( Fig .
6C ) .
This result suggests the following two possibilities .
First , although most of the IFN-regulated genes are equally repressed by the three repressors , there are genes that are not affected by ICSAT but are repressed by IRF-2 or ICSBP .
The different repressive effects of the three repressors on the same gene imply a novel mechanism of gene regulation for IFN-regulated genes .
In addition to being differently regulated by the three activating molecules , their expressions are controlled by the three different repressors .
Accordingly , the final level of gene expression is determined by a balance between activators and repressors .
Our result is the first demonstration for IFN-regulated genes that suggests gene regulation through differential repression by the multiple members of the repressor proteins .
For the second point , it suggests that there are genes that select the activation signal whose effect is repressed by ICSAT .
The 2-5 OAS gene was activated by either IFN- « or IFN-y stimulation , and both activities were repressed by ICSAT ( Fig .
6A and 7B ) .
On the other hand , although 2 % ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci was also activated by either IFN- « or IFN-y , only the activation by IFN-y was repressed by ICSAT ( compare Fig .
6C and 8B ) .
Therefore , in some genes , ICSAT exerts different repressive effects according to which activator comes in .
These two points suggest that at least three elements must be considered in discussing the gene regulation for the IFN-regulated genes , i.e. , the three activating molecules , the three repressor proteins , and the target genes they work on .
It is unknown why ICSAT could not repress the IFN- « -mediated activation of 2x ( ISG15-ISRE ) -tk-Luci , even though ICSAT binds to ISG15-ISRE .
A simple explanation is that the activating molecule , ISGF3 , might have strong DNA-binding affinity over ICSAT for ISG15-ISRE .
This idea is supported by the result of the same experiment with 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) -tk-Luci ( Fig .
6C ) .
GBP-ISRE , which is reported to be inefficiently recognized by ISGF3 ( 74 ) , strongly binds to ICSAT ( Fig .
4 ) .
This fact is consistent with the low-level activation of 2X ( GBP-ISRE ) -tk-Luci by IFN- « and the strong repression by ICSAT .
However , we could not rule out the possible contribution of the yet undefined protein-protein interaction in ICSAT-mediated repression .
Further investigations of the repression mechanisms of ICSAT other than the binding competition with the activators are under way .
During the preparation of the manuscript , two other groups independently cloned Pip/LSIRF , the mouse counterpart of ICSAT ( 12 , 35 ) .
Pip binds to the immunoglobulin light-chain gene enhancer E , , , only in the presence of PU.1 .
Further-more , Pip and PU.1 function as mutually dependent transcription activators of the enhancer ( 12 ) .
This finding seems to argue against our results .
However , the two different studies appear to indicate multifunctional roles for ICSAT/Pip .
ICSAT , as a monomer protein , binds directly to its target ele-ments .
In this case , ICSAT functions as a transcription repressor , as demonstrated in our study .
When an interaction partner protein , like PU.1 , is present , the newly formed Pip/PU.1 complex exerts transactivational effect .
The dual function of ICSAT , in addition to its repressive effect , will also provide further evidence for the differential role of IRF family proteins on gene regulation .
The specific expression of ICSAT in ATL cells leads to the assumption that HTLV-1 might be responsible for it .
We have demonstrated the induced expression of ICSAT by expressing Tax protein in Jurkat cells and provided evidence for the pos- Vou .
16 , 1996 sible mechanism of ICSAT expression in ATL cells .
Tax is a unique regulatory protein encoded by HTLV-1 that is not found in other oncogenic transforming retroviruses , and it has been implicated in mechanisms that lead to cellular transformation during HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis ( 5 ) .
These mechanisms involve Tax-dependent transactivation of cellular genes that are critical in cell proliferation ( 17 , 24 , 40 , 52 ) .
We have demonstrated the induced expression of ICSAT from a silent chromosomal gene by transfecting the tax gene and have thus proposed a novel candidate gene whose expression is induced in the presence of Tax .
Whether the induced expression of ICSAT by Tax takes part in cellular transformation by HTLV-1 remains to be investigated .
Considering that another T-cell activation signal , PMA-A23187 stimulation , also leads to the ICSAT induction ( Fig .
3C ) , it is strongly suggested that ICSAT takes part in transducing the proliferation signals in response to T-cell activation , directly or indirectly .
It is also possible to speculate from the results of the cotransfection experiments that ICSAT interferes with the antiviral effect of IFNs by disrupting the finely regulated balance of the IFN-regulated genes , subsequently leading to HTLV-1 prolifera-tion .
Our findings suggest the possible involvement of the IRF family transcription factor in T-cell transformation by HTLV-1 .
Further analysis is necessary to elucidate the significance of ICSAT expression in activated and transformed T cells .
