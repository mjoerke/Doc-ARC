Here we demonstrate that fusion of HeLa cells with either diploid or tetraploid B cells ( Daudi ) results in widespread extinction of several other B cell-encoded genes that are expressed in a B cell-specific manner .
In contrast , expression of B cell-expressed genes that are not dependent on cell-specific controls is unaffected .
We show that the molecular mechanism ( s ) underlying Ig gene extinction can be explained , at least in part , by a lack of transcription factors that are essential for Ig gene transcription .
These transcription factors are either not produced due to block of transcription of their respective genes ( Oct-2 , OBF-1 , PU.1 ) , or are rendered inactive posttranslationally ( NF- < B , E47 ) .
By isolating Daudi x HeLa heterokaryons a few hours after fusion , we have studied the initial fate of two B cell-specific transcription factors involved in Ig gene transcription , Oct-2 and NF-xB .
This report provides the first demonstration that upon fusion with Hela cells , the nuclear contents of B cell-expressed transcription factors are depleted within a few hours with kinetics that are as fast or faster than that of Ig gene extinction .
Thus , the extinguishing mechanism is effective very early after fusion .
We suggest that extinction of Ig genes is part of a global mechanism that suppresses the differentiation program foreign to the HeLa phenotype .
Key words : Immunoglobulin gene , Transcription factor , Oct-2 , OBE-1 , PU.1 , NF-kB , Somatic cell hybrid , Extinction INTRODUCTION As cells progress in development from totipotent cells to cells in specialized tissues , their developmental potential gets progressively limited .
Both positive and negative factors have been implied in this differentiation .
Whereas many cell type-specific positively acting regulators have been characterized , the role of negatively acting regulatory proteins in specifying a particular cellular phenotype is less clear , although several examples of repressor-like activities have been described ( reviewed by Hanna-Rose and Hansen , 1996 ) .
In particular , the importance of negative control in animal cells has been postulated on the basis of studies on gene expression in somatic cell hybrids in which the phenotype of extinction is often observed ( reviewed by Gourdeau and Fournier , 1990 ; Boshart et al. , 1993 ) .
Most frequently , when cells expressing a given tissue-specific gene are fused with non-expressing cells , transcription of that gene ceases , whereas housekeeping genes specified by each of the parental genomes continue to be expressed , a phenomenon termed extinction ( reviewed by Boshart et al. , 1993 ) .
The extinguishing mechanism ( s ) is encoded by the non expressing partner cell , because loss of a specific chromosome from that cell results in re-expression of the extinguished gene .
By using monochromosomal hybrids ( Killary and Fournier , 1984 ) or hybrids with a reduced number of chromosomes , at least three discrete loci of extinction , termed tissue-specific extinguisher ( Tse ) loci , have been defined and one , Tsel , has been cloned and functionally characterized ( Boshart et al. , 1991 ; Jones et al. , 1991 ) .
It is generally believed that the mechanisms implicated in the phenomenon of extinction reflect regulatory mechanisms that are involved in selection of tissue-specific gene expression in differentiated cells .
Therefore , identification of the factors that mediate extinction in cell hybrids could contribute to identifying key regulators of cell differentiation .
In this report we have studied the molecular mechanisms of extinction using Ig genes as a model system .
Ig genes are among the molecularly best characterized genes .
They are expressed in a B cell-specific and developmentally controlled manner .
This specificity is directed by promoter and enhancer elements consisting of multiple sequence motifs binding both ubiquitously and B cell specifically expressed transcription 2580 S. Junker and others factors .
It is the combinatorial interaction of these motifs that dictate the specificity of Ig gene transcription ( reviewed by Staudt and Lenardo , 1991 ) .
When B cells are fused with e.g .
fibroblasts , expression of Ig genes is suppressed within hours after fusion ( Junker and Pedersen , 1985 ) .
In proliferating hybrids , this suppression affects the level of Ig gene transcription ( Greenberg et al. , 1987 ; Junker et al. , 1989 ) and is mediated through sequences within both the Ig promoter and intron enhancer ( Junker et al. , 1988 ; Zaller et al. , 1988 ) .
All Ig promoters and enhancers share the conserved octamer motif ATGCAAAT .
In vivo studies have shown that this octamer motif can confer B cell-specific expression both as a promoter element ( Wirth et al. , 1987 ; Dreyfus et al. , 1987 ) and as an enhancer element ( Gerster et al. , 1987 ) .
We and others have previously shown that the octamer motif is a target for Ig gene extinction ( Yu et al. , 1989 ; Bergman et al. , 1990 ; Junker et al. , 1990 ) and that extinction correlates with lack of the B cell-specific transcription factor Oct-2 that binds to this octamer element .
Since the octamer element in Ig promoters is crucial for promoter activity as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo ( Mizushima-Sugano and Roeder , 1986 ; Jenuwein and Grossched1 , 1991 ) , its transcriptional inactivity could in principle suffice to silence Ig gene transcription in the hybrids .
In fact , transiently introduced Oct-2 was indeed sufficient to reactivate a stably integrated kappa promoter construct that had been silenced as a consequence of cell fusion ( Junker et al. , 1990 ) .
However , while the octamer element of Ig promoters is required for promoter activity , this element appears to be dispensable in the context of the intron enhancer , because mutation of this motif has only a modest effect on enhancer activity ( Kiledjian et al. , 1988 ; Jenuwein and 1991 ; Yuan et al. , 1995 ) .
Loss of factor or factors binding this motif should therefore have a similarly limited effect on enhancer activity .
This could explain why ectopic expression of Oct-2 , transiently introduced into B cell x fibroblast hybrids was inadequate to reverse extinction of a silenced IgH enhancer construct as well as of endogenous Ig genes ( Junker et al. , 1990 ) .
Consequently , additional targets for the extinguishing mechanism ( s ) must exist within the intron enhancer .
Here we extend our earlier studies on extinction of Ig expression by showing that in proliferating Daudi x HeLa hybrids several of the B cell-specific transcription factors that are critical for Ig gene transcription are either no longer produced because of block of transcription of their respective genes , or are not available for transcription activation , because they are not modified post-translationally .
Thus extinction of Ig genes is , at least in part , due to the lack of transcriptionally active lymphoid-specific transcription factors .
This is true irrespective of whether the Daudi partner is diploid or tetraploid .
Moreover , we show that this extinguishing mechanism ( s ) is not limited to Ig genes and to genes encoding transcription factors required for Ig gene transcription , but is more global , affecting several other genes that are expressed in a B cell-specific manner .
Finally , by analysing FACS-isolated heterokaryons already within 6 hours after fusion we demonstrate that nuclear contents of two B cell-specific transcription factors , Oct-2 and NF-KB implicated in Ig gene transcription , are rapidly depleted , thus establishing a correlation between the fast kinetics of Ig gene suppression and depletion of several B cell specific transcription factors from the nucleus .
To our knowledge , this is the first report to shed light on the initial fate of cell type-restricted transcription factors that are involved in transcription of tissue-specific genes following cell fusion .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture , fusion and hybrid selection Daudi ( 2n ) and Daudi ( 4n ) are diploid and tetraploid derivatives , respectively , of a human Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line that expresses IgM and x light chains .
The cells grow in suspension .
They are resistant to HAT selection ( Szybalska and Szybalski , 1962 ) .
HeLa D98 AH » is a thioguanine ( 10+ M ) resistant derivative of HeLa .
The cells are killed in HAT medium .
All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum .
Cells were fused in suspension using polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) as described previously ( Junker , 1982 ) , and pools of HAT selected hybrids were harvested within 3-4 weeks after fusion .
To reduce problems of chromosome segregation , heterokaryons were collected using the FITC-FACS technique ( Junker , 1982 ) .
Briefly , Daudi cells that grow in suspension were stained with FITC and subsequently fused with HeLa cells that grow in monolayers .
Six to twelve hours after plating the fusion mixture all floating cells , i.e .
non-fused , FITC-stained Daudi cells were removed by rinsing with PBS .
From the remaining mixed cell population consisting of unfused HeLa cells and FITC-containing Daudi x HeLa heterokaryons the latter cells were retrieved by fluorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS ) and grown for the indicated times in ordinary culture medium supplemented with gentamycin ( 100 ug/ml ) and HAT .
Purity of the sorted populations was assessed immediately after their isolation by staining the nuclei with the DNA-specific vital dye Hoechst 33342 .
For at least 12 hours after fusion nuclei derived from the Daudi and HeLa partners can easily be distinguished by virtue of shape and of size .
Thereafter nuclear swelling makes it difficult to identify their origin .
A sort window was selected such that at least 70 % of the isolated cells were heterokaryons containing one genome equivalent ( 1s:1s ) from each partner cell .
Up to 8-12 % of the sorted cells were unfused parental cells , of which Daudi cells constituted the majority .
However , since Daudi cells grow in suspension and heterokaryons are selected for adherence , floating Daudi cells could easily be removed from the plated cell populations .
In this way the proportion of unfused HeLa cells did not exceed 5 % of cells harvested for further analyses .
Three weeks after fusion chromosome counts of metaphases from hybrids were at least 90 % of that expected from the sum of parental chromosomes , i.e .
52 from HeLa cells and 46 or 92 from diploid and tetraploid Daudi cells , respectively .
Analysis of surface markers Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against the surface markers CD19 , CD20 , CD10 or HLA class II ( Dakopatts , Denmark ) and analysed using a fluorescence activated cell sorter .
RNA analyses Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared and RNase protection mapping performed as previously described ( Junker et al. , 1988 ) .
Cytoplasmic RNA from FACS-isolated heterokaryons was prepared according to the method of Gough ( 1988 ) .
For mapping of u transcripts the probe was a 900 nt Sp6 transcript from plasmid pGHup4 ( Johansson et al. , 1990 ) .
This probe can be used to distinguish between the secreted form , ps ( 517 nt ) and the membrane form , Lim ( 327 nt ) , respectively .
As a control for equal loading , a probe for gamma-actin ( Enoch et al. , 1986 ) was used .
That probe produces a protected fragment of 146 nt .
For mapping Oct-2 transcripts a probe made from plasmid pBlueC+delta XbaNhe was used ; this probe protects a fragment of approx .
300 nt .
For mapping OBF-1 transcripts , a probe made from Blue OBF1/5 '' SfiXemT3 was used .
The probe protects a fragment of approx .
200 nt .
For northern blot analyses , 15 ug RNA from parental and 15 ug RNA from hybrid cells were separated on a 1.1 % agarose-formalde-hyde-MOPS gel , and transferred onto a Hybond N membrane ( Amersham ) by capillary blotting .
Slot blot analyses were performed as described previously ( Junker and Pedersen , 1985 ) .
Hybridizations were performed at 55°C for 20 hours in buffer containing 50 % formamide , 2.5 % SSPE , 0.38 % SDS , 2.5 % Denhardt 's , 100 ug/ml dextran sulfate , 250 pg/ml salmon sperm DNA , and probe ( 10° cpm/ml ) .
The filters were washed 3 x 20 minutes at room temperature ( RT ) in 2x SSC , 0.1 % SDS ; 2x 15 minutes at RT in 1x SSC , 0.1 % SDS ; 15 minutes at 68°C in 1x SSC , 0.1 % SDS ; and finally at 68°C in 0.1x SSC , 0.1 % SDS .
The cDNA probe for PU.1 was given to us by Dr S. Pettersson .
EBNA1 transcripts were detected using a BamHI fragment from plasmid 5G1pBK obtained from Dr I. Ermmberg , and EBNA3 transcripts were identified using plasmid J237-B8 given to us by Dr L. Rymo .
Nuclear run-on assays Nuclear run-on assays were done as described previously ( Junker et al. , 1988 ) .
To detect Oct-2 specific transcripts , single-stranded DNA was prepared from a 2 kb Oct-2a cDNA fragment inserted into pBlue-scripts KS~- or pBluescript* .
Preparation of nuclear extracts , and band shift assays Nuclear extracts from parental cells and their hybrids were prepared using the miniprep method described by Schreiber et al .
( 1989 ) .
Probes for octamer-binding proteins and for NF-KB binding were obtained from Promega .
The E47 probe was given to us by Dr S. Pettersson .
The Oct-binding reaction was done as described by Schreiber et al .
( 1989 ) , and the E47 analysis as described by Andersen et al. , 1997 ) .
NF-xB binding reactions were done in a total volume of 20 pul containing 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 40 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 2 ug/ml !
bovine serum albumin , 100 ug/ml PolydIdC , probe ( 10,000 cpm ) , and 5 ug nuclear extract .
The complexes were resolved in recirculating buffer containing 6.7 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 3 mM Na acetate , and 1 mM EDTA .
RESULTS Concomitant extinction of Ig gene expression and B cell-specific markers irrespective of gene dosage in proliferating Daudi x HeLa hybrids To avoid problems with chromosome segregation often associated with somatic cell hybrids , newly fused Daudi B cells and HeLa cells were purified by FACS as described in Materials and Methods , and harvested for analysis within three weeks after fusion .
In such genomically near-complete hybrids kappa light chain-specific transcripts were not detectable in cytoplasmic RNA ( Fig .
1 ) .
This was true also for -specific transcripts ( data not shown ) irrespective of whether the Daudi partner was diploid or tetraploid , thus demonstrating the dominant nature of the Ig extinguishing mechanism ( s ) .
We then asked if the extinguishing mechanism ( s ) is specific for Ig genes or is part of a more broadly acting mechanism for establishment of the genetic programme of the Ig expressing B cell .
To this end we examined the hybrids for expression of several B cell-specific surface markers : the pan B cell markers CD19 and CD20 , the Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) associated marker CD10 ( CALLA ) , and MHC class II antigens .
All these markers are expressed at high levels on unfused Daudi cells , Mechanisms of Ig gene extinction in cell hybrids 2581 but not in HeLa cells .
FACS analysis of the hybrids showed that none of these markers were expressed ( data not shown ) .
Nor were any of the hybrids positive for intracellular staining of these antigens as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy .
Absence of specific fluorescent signals was therefore not due to a defect in transport of the antigens to the cell membrane .
Thus , the extinguishing mechanism ( s ) affecting Ig gene downregulation in Daudi x HeLa hybrids is coordinately affecting several other B cell-specific genes .
The question therefore arises whether all Daudi-encoded genes that are transcriptionally active prior to fusion become down-regulated upon fusion with HeLa cells .
A priori at least one of them is not , namely the ubiquitously expressed HPRT gene , retention of which the hybrids were selected for .
But are other genes whose expression is not subjected to selection pressure and does not require B cell-specific controls also extinguished ?
The Daudi cell line is derived from an EBV* Burkitt 's lymphoma and carries a chromosomally integrated , non-transforming EBV strain that has a deletion of the EBV nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) .
Therefore , Daudi cells express only EBNA1 and EBNA3-6 .
While expression of EBNA2-6 requires a B cell environment , EBNA-1 expression appears to be independent of cell-specific or virus-encoded factors ( Contreras-Salazar et al. , 1989 ; Contreras-Brodin et al. , 1991 ) .
Thus in hybrids between BL cells and e.g .
HeLa cells , EBNA2-6 expression should be down-regulated concomitantly with Ig genes , whereas EBNA1 expression should remain unaffected .
Slot blot analysis of cytoplasmic RNA from 20-day-old Daudi x HeLa hybrids showed that EBNA3 expression was indeed down-regulated , whereas levels of EBNA-1 transcripts in the hybrids were quite similar to those in unfused Daudi cells , thus confirming previous findings on regulation of EBV genes encoding nuclear antigens ( Fig .
1 ) .

The B cell-restricted transcription factors Oct-2 and OBF-1 are transcriptionally down-regulated In B cell x fibroblast hybrids , Ig gene extinction correlates with lack of Oct-2 specific transcripts ( Yu et al. , 1989 ; Bergman et al. , 1990 ; Junker et al. , 1990 ) .
Our Daudi x HeLa hybrids also lack Oct-2-specific transcripts , irrespective of the ploidy of the Daudi partner ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether the rate of transcription rather than RNA stability explains this lack of Oct-2 transcripts , nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed with nuclei prepared from Daudi and HeLa cells , respectively , and from their four-week-old hybrids ( Fig .
2A ) .
In agreement with our previous findings on B cell x fibroblast hybrids , transcription of both x and u genes is blocked in Daudi x HeLa hybrids .
Concomitantly , transcription of Oct-2 is down-regulated in the hybrids ( Fig .
2 ) , demonstrating that a Daudi x HeLa hybrid environment is not permissive for transcription of the gene encoding the B cell-restricted transcription factor Oct-2 .
This is the first evidence of extinction of a tissue-specifc transcription factor at the transcriptional level .
During the past few years accumulating evidence has suggested that Oct-2 may not be the critical determinant for octamer-dependent Ig gene transcription ( for references see Strubin et al. , 1995 ) .
Instead , transcriptional contributions of the ubiquitously expressed Oct-1 in conjunction with a non-DNA binding co-activator has been suggested .
Indeed , several groups reported recently the cloning of such a co-activator , termed OBF-1 , BOB1 or OCA-B , that is expressed in a B cell-specific manner and that can interact with both Oct-1 and Oct 3 -actin pUCI® < © » @ e @ _C 1 Daudi ( 21 ) HeLa D98 AH , Daudi ( Zn ) x HeLa 2 to drive transcription from a x promoter in a non-B cell environment ( Strubin et al. , 1995 ; Gstaiger et al. , 1995 ; Luo and Roeder , 1995 ; Pfisterer et al. , 1995 ) .
We used RNase protection assays to determine the levels of OBF-1 transcripts in hybrids between HeLa cells and diploid or tetraploid Daudi cells .
Fig .
2B shows that OBF-1 transcripts are not detectable in any of the hybrids irrespective of the gene dosage of the B cell partner .
Thus , the fate of OBF-1 expression mirrors that of Oct-2 in genomically complete B cell x non-B cell hybrids .
Extinction of IgM ( u ) and x light chain gene expression is associated with lack of several B cell-restricted transcription factors essential for Ig enhancer function The fact that the IgH intron enhancer is a target for the extinguishing mechanism ( Junker et al. , 1988 ; Zaller et al. , 1988 ) , and that forced expression of Oct-2 or OBF-1 in hybrids could reverse extinction of neither a silenced IgH enhancer construct nor endogenous Ig genes ( data not shown ) led us to investigate the fate of some of the other transcription factors that are crucial for Ig intron enhancer activity .
The transcription factor PU.1 that is specifically expressed in B cells , macrophages and erythroid cells binds to the uB element of the IgH intron enhancer .
This element appears to be of prominent importance for enhancer activity because site-directed mutagenesis of that motif reduces the transcriptional activity of the enhancer to 20-50 % in B cells of all developmental stages ( reviewed by Lieberman and Baltimore , 1991 ) .
To assess levels of PU.1-specific transcripts in Daudi x HeLa hybrids , northern blot analysis was performed on cytoplasmic RNA prepared from Daudi , HeLa and their 20 day-old hybrids .
PU.1 transcripts were detected in unfused Daudi cells , but not in HeLa cells nor in their hybrids ( Fig .
3A ) .

Extracts in lanes 2 and 3 were preincubated with a 1,000-fold excess of oligos containing octamer and NF- « B binding sites , respectively .
Mechanisms of Ig gene extinction in cell hybrids 2583 expression pattern of PU.1 mRNA is consistent with its participation in B-dependent enhancer activity .
The intron enhancers of both IgH and Ig x light chain genes contain multiple functional elements of the E-box class .
Mutations in any single E box significantly reduce IgH and K gene expression .
Several E box binding proteins have been cloned , of which the three E2A proteins ( E12 , E47 , and E2-5 ) that arise from alternative splicing of the E2A gene 's primary transcript , are involved in Ig gene transcription .
In mature B cells homodimers of E47 appear to be the transcriptionally active form ( Shen and Kadesch , 1995 ) .
We assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) the pattern of nuclear factors binding the E5 box motif in four-week-old Daudi x HeLa hybrids and in their parental cells .
Fig .
3B shows that the B cell-specific shift is not produced in nuclear extracts from the hybrids or from unfused HeLa cells .
This B cell-specific complex contains predominantly E47 homodimers , because it is greatly reduced in the presence of a polyclonal E47-specific antiserum known to abolish DNA binding ( data not shown ) .
The KB site is a crucial determinant for activity of the x light chain intron enhancer , because mutagenesis of that site almost abolishes enhancer activity ( reviewed by Lieberman and Baltimore , 1991 ) .
Members of the NF-KB family bind this site .
While NF-KB is localized constitutively in the nucleus of B cells , NF-KB is sequestered in the cytoplasm of non-B cells through interaction with IB , but may be released and translocated into the nucleus in response to appropriate stimuli ( reviewed recently by Verma et al. , 1995 ) .
EMSA of nuclear extracts from Daudi cells with a high-affinity binding site for NF-KB generated a single retarded complex ( Fig .
3C ) .
HeLa cells and Daudi x HeLa hybrids were devoid of nuclear NF-KB , but large amounts of NF-KB were sequestered in the cytoplasm of all three cell lines and could be released by treatment of cytoplasmic extracts with the mild detergent sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , the transcriptional contribution was assessed by transiently transfecting a reporter construct containing the CAT gene under the control of multimerized KB sites .
The transcriptional activity of that construct was very low in HeLa and Daudi x HeLa cells , but high in unfused Daudi cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , these experiments demonstrate that NF-KB in hybrid cells is unavailable for transcription .
It thus appears that Ig gene extinction is mediated , at least in part , through widespread down-regulation of several transcription factors essential for B cell-specific Ig gene transcription .
Nuclear contents of B cell-specific transcription factors are rapidly depleted following fusion between Daudi and HeLa cells A remarkable feature of Ig gene extinction is its fast kinetics .
In Daudi x L cell heterokaryons , i.e .
newly formed hybrids in which the parental nuclei are still separated within a common cytoplasm , the levels of cytoplasmic transcripts specific for u and x genes decrease within a few hours after fusion ( Junker and Pedersen , 1985 ) .
These findings suggest that arrest of Ig gene expression occurs shortly after fusion by a mechanism that leads to rapid disappearance of cytoplasmic Ig mRNA .
Whether that mechanism operates exclusively at the level of transcription can not be tested directly , because it is technically 2584 S.

Nuclear contents of Oct-2 ( A ) and of NF-KB ( B ) are rapidly depleted upon fusion of Daudi ( 2n ) cells with HeLa cells .
( A ) Heterokaryons collected by FACS were stained with the the DNA-specific vital dye Hoechst 33342 to assess purity of the sorted populations .
Nuclear extracts were prepared at the indicated times and contents of Oct-2 ( B ) and NF-xB ( C ) were analysed by EMSA .
3 ug of protein were used per assay .
In B , the reduced signal in the 48 hour-lane is due to loss of sample .
difficult to collect sufficient numbers of heterokaryons so early after fusion to perform a nuclear run-on assay .
However , some insight into the mechanisms responsible for down-regulation may be extracted by analysing shortly after fusion the nuclear contents of transcription factors that are critical for Ig gene expression .
For that purpose heterokaryons were collected by FACS from 6 hours after fusion and maintained in culture for up to 48 hours after fusion .
Purity of the sorted populations was assessed by Hoechst-staining live cells prior to commencing large-scale collection , and when the cells were harvested for analysis ( Fig .
4A ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from 6 to 48 hours after fusion and analysed for contents of Oct-2 and NF-KB , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( Fig .
4B , C ) .
Six hours after fusion , Oct-2 contents were marginally reduced to 80 % of that in mock-fused Daudi cells .
However , already 12 hours after fusion Oct-2 binding activity was only around 10 % of that in Daudi cells .
During the subsequent 24 hours , Oct-2 binding decreased even further to a level of around 2 % of that prior to fusion .
NF-KB exhibited an even more dramatic decline in binding activity .
Like Oct-2 , levels of nuclear NF-KB decreased slightly during the initial 6 hours after fusion ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , 12 hours after fusion and onwards , NF- « B binding was no longer detectable .
The data suggest the following mutually non-excluding fates of these two B cell-specific transcription factors : ( a ) they continue to be produced , but are unable to bind due to post-translational modifications ; ( b ) they are being actively displaced from the nucleus ; and/or ( c ) their production ceases due to transcriptional block of their respective genes .
Oct-2 gene transcription in B cells is rapidly abolished upon fusion with HeLa cells Since transcription of B cell-encoded Oct-2 genes is abolished in proliferating Daudi x HeLa hybrids , and Oct-2 protein is rapidly depleted from the nucleus , block of Oct-2 gene transcription may be manifest already shortly after fusion .
To assess a correlation between levels of Oct-2 protein and of Oct-2 specific transcripts we analysed FACS-isolated heterokaryons for contents of Oct-2 transcripts using RNase protection assays ( Fig .
5 ) .

Cytoplasmic Oct-2-specific transcripts are rapidly down-regulated upon fusion of Daudi ( 2n ) cells with HeLa cells .
Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared as described ( Gough , 1988 ) from FACS-isolated heterokaryons at the indicated times .
The probe for Oct-2 was co-hybridized with the gamma-actin probe to control for equal loading .
of cytoplasmic Oct-2 transcripts were reduced to 50 % , and 24 hours after fusion the level was only 10 % of that in mock-fused Daudi cells .
Some 72 hours after fusion , Oct-2 specific transcripts were barely detectable .
This rapid decline in contents of cytoplasmic Oct-2 transcripts in the hybrids follows largely the kinetics induced by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D in unfused Daudi cells ( data not shown ) .
It is therefore likely , that following fusion of Daudi with HeLa cells , Oct-2 gene transcription is abolished almost immediately .
DISCUSSION We have shown that Ig gene expression is abolished in proliferating hybrids between EBV-positive Daudi Burkitt 's lymphoma cells and EB V-negative HeLa cells irrespective of the ploidy of the Daudi partner .
It seems , therefore , unlikely that a simple gene dosage effect in favour of the HeLa partner and thus dilution of positive factors upon fusion can explain the mechanism of extinction .
Instead , our data demonstrate that the extinguishing mechanism is truly dominant .
Extinction is not restricted to Ig genes or to genes involved in Ig gene transcription , because several other B cell-encoded genes requiring B cell-specific controls for expression are also subjected to down-regulation .
Thus , the extinguishing mechanism ( s ) appears to globally affect the repertoire of B cell-encoded genes .
These observations corroborate those on hybrids between myeloma cells and T cells ( Lieberman et al. , 1993 ) and on hybrids between hepatoma cells and fibroblasts ( Chin and Fournier , 1987 ) .
However , we provide evidence that this down-regulation is not indiscriminate .
For instance , expression of the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA1 , which is not dependent on cell-type specific control ( Contreras-Salazar et al. , 1989 ; Contreras-Brodin et al. , 1991 ) , is not affected in our hybrids .
In contrast , EBNA3 , which is B cell-specifically expressed , is down-regulated in hybrids .
Therefore , the extinguishing mechanism ( s ) appears to operate not only globally , but also highly selectively , being restricted to genes expressed in a B cell-specific manner ( Table 1 ) .
This selectivity extends also to transcriptional regulators that are B cell-specific .
Five transcription factors that are implicated in Ig gene transcription are no longer available for transcription in the hybrid environment .
Three of these factors , Oct-2 , OBF-1 , and PU.1 are not produced , because transcription of their respective genes is down-regulated .
Two transcription factors , E47 and NF-KB , although ubiquitously expressed , are unable to bind DNA , because they are not modified post-translationally .
Since mutation of the binding sites for any of these transcription factors severely reduces Ig enhancer ( reviewed by Lieberman and Baltimore , 1991 ) and promoter ( Schwarzen-bach et al. , 1995 ) activity , redundancy of any of these sites in concert with the octamer element could be sufficient to mediate extinction of Ig genes .
This is supported by the fast kinetics of down-regulation of p-specific transcripts which is very similar to the nuclear depletion of Oct-2 and of NF-KB .
These results represent the first analysis of the fate of tissue-specific transcription factors in heterokaryons .
The kinetics of down-regulation of Oct-2 specific transcripts is very similar to that in unfused Daudi cells grown in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D ( unpublished data ) .
It is therefore likely that transcription of Daudi-encoded Oct-2 Mechanisms of Ig gene extinction in cell hybrids 2585 Table 1 .
Expression of Daudi B cell-specified genes in DaudixHelLa somatic cell hybrids Daudi ( 21 ) Daudi ( 21 ) xHeLa HeLa i ua A + IOI +4 I + t t t + t+ + + + + ++ genes is blocked either immediately or very shortly after fusion with HeLa cells , although we can not exclude the possibility that instability of Oct-2 transcripts also contributes to this down-regulation .
The rapid suppression of Oct-2 resembles that of the closely related Oct-3/4 , which is highly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic carcinoma ( EC ) cells .
However , upon treatment of such cells with retinoic acid Oct3/4 is transcriptionally down-regulated with kinetics that are as fast as those of Oct-2 in our heterokaryons ( Shimazaki et al. , 1993 ; Minucci et al. , 1996 ) .
The rapid depletion of NF-KB from the nucleus is remark-able .
Several models can at present explain the fast kinetics .
( 1 ) IB may translocate across the nuclear membrane and capture free and even DNA-bound NF- « B .
The source of IxB may originate from an excess of pre-existing IKB in unfused HeLa cells .
It is also possible that this source is supplemented by activation of IKB genes through the action of B cell-specified free NF-KB ( for references , see Verma et al. , 1995 ) .
( 2 ) Alternatively , DNA-bound NF-KB in the hybrid environment is unstable , and , consequently , NF-KB shuttles back into the cytoplasm and gets sequestered by IKxB .
Although other mutually non-exclusive models are compatible with our observations it is interesting to note that unlike in Daudi x HeLa hybrids , NF-KB is constitutively nuclear in B x T cell hybrids despite the fact that NF-KB is cytosolar in unfused T cells .
We suggest that somatic cell hybridization may constitute a useful model system for studying mechanisms for maintaining high , constitutive levels of nuclear NF-KB .
At this stage we can not exclude the possibility that repres-sors of Ig gene transcription also contribute to extinction .
In fact , negative elements within Ig transcriptional units have been identified ( reviewed by Lieberman and Baltimore , 1991 ) , and proteins with repressing function have been characterized ( for recent references , see Oancea et al. , 1997 ) .
However , inhibitors of activators may be similarly effective .
For instance IxB family members can sequester transcriptionally active NF-xB in the cytoplasm .
Also bHLH transcription factors can be rendered transcriptionally inactive through heterodimerization with Id family members ( reviewed by Lieberman and Baltimore , 1991 ) .
It is probable that one or more of these proteins also contribute to effectively down-regulate Ig gene transcription in our cell hybrids .
Thus , the hybrid system may be amenable to genetic analyses of the relative dominance of positive and negative regulatory circuits .
2586 S. Junker and others On the basis of the present study and on previous analyses of cell type-specific transcription factors in different types of somatic cell hybrids ( Nitsch et al. , 1993 ; and reviewed by Boshart et al. , 1993 ) it appears that extinction of tissue-specific genes is attributed , at least in part , to lack of transcriptional activation .
This inactivation is due to the combined effect of suppression at the level of transcription of some of the genes encoding transcription factors , and of post-translational inactivation of others .
Thus the extinguishing mechanism is multi-factorial , implying the existence of as many extinguisher loci as e.g .
B cell-specific transcription factors .
Or more likely , few putative master regulators could control the activity of several of these factors , thus reflecting a hierarchial order in the expression of cell-specific transcription factors .
Functional hierarchies of regulators during development and in differentiated cells have been identified ( reviewed by Ray and Schiipbach , 1996 ) .
In fact , somatic cell hybridization has been used as a genetic tool to demonstrate one such example , namely the control of HNF1 & by the liver-restricted transcription factor HNF4 ( Kuo et al. , 1992 ) .
While the initial and fast kinetics of Ig gene down-regulation may very well be explained by the action of a few putative master regulators that repress an entire battery of genes , these regulators are not necessarily involved in maintaining extinction of target genes .
Instead , subsequent induction of global changes of chromatin structure could be responsible for the stable inheritance of the extinguished phenotype in proliferating hybrids in analogy with the 'hit and run ' repression by the Drosophila gene hunchback , in which different proteins like Polycomb take over and mediate long range changes of chromatin structure ( reviewed by Orlando and Paro , 1995 ) .
This would be compatible with the extraordinary stability of maintenance of the extinguished phenotype .
Thus , in e.g .
hepatoma microcell hybrids containing a single copy of a human fibroblast chromosome no .
17 , on which TSE-1 resides , extinction of TAT is stably inherited ( Killary and Fournier , 1984 ) .
Although we now know that extinction of expression of tissue-specific genes in somatic cell hybrids is at least partially due to lack of activation , the mechanism ( s ) that control the expression of the corresponding tissue-specific extinguisher loci remain to be elucidated .
Whatever the mechanisms are , we believe that the genetic approach of somatic cell hybridization will be helpful to our understanding of the complex network of regulation of B cell differentiation in general , and of Ig gene transcription in particular .
In that respect it may constitute a valuable tool to complement knockout experiments in embryonic stem cells .
Surprisingly , virtually no such experiments have resulted in loss of expression of the presumed target gene .
This apparent redundancy of specific transcription factors emphasizes the fact that development is a highly dynamic and selective process .
In contrast , by using cell lines that are already committed to a particular differentiation program interference with expression of specific regulators mediated through cell fusion should grant insight into the interplay between positive and negative developmental strat-egies .
