Multiple Transcription Factors Are Required for Activation of Human Interleukin 9 Gene in T Cells* ( Received for publication , December 22 , 1995 , and in revised form , March 12 , 1996 ) Yuan Xiao Zhut§ , Li Ya Kang $ § , Wen Luo , Chou-Chi H.

We demonstrated that IL-9 gene expression is controlled , at least in part , by transcriptional activation .
Transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene linked to serially deleted sequences of the 5'-flanking region of the IL-9 gene has revealed several positive and negative regulatory elements involved in the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells .
An AP-1 site at -146 to -140 was shown to be involved in the expression of the IL-9 gene .
A proximal region between -46 and -80 was identified as the minimum sequence for the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells .
Within this region , an site at -59 to -50 and its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence were demonstrated to play a critical role for the IL-9 promoter activity .
DNA-protein binding studies indicated that NF-KB , c-Jun , and potentially novel proteins ( around 35 kDa ) can bind to this important sequence .
Mutations at different sites within this proximal promoter region abolished the promoter activity as well as the DNA binding .
Taken together , these results suggest that the cooperation of different transcription factors is essential for IL-9 gene expression in T cells .
Interleukin 9 ( IL-9 ) is a T cell-derived cytokine with pleio-tropic activities on various cell types ( 1 ) .
The expression of IL-9 is detectable mainly in activated CD4+ helper T cells ( 2 , 3 ) .
The targets of IL-9 include T cells ( 1 , 4 ) , B cells ( 5 , 6 ) , mast cells ( 7 , 8 ) , erythroid and myeloid precursors ( 9 , 10 ) , and fetal thy-mocytes ( 11 ) .
It has been shown that IL-9 can promote the proliferation of activated and transformed T cells , the production of immunoglobulins by B cells , the proliferation and differentiation of mast cells , and erythroid progenitors .
The involvement of IL-9 in tumorigenesis has also been suggested , since : 1 ) the preferential expression of IL-9 was found in cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin 's disease and ana * This work was supported in part by United States Public Health Service Grants RO1DK43105 and RO1HL48819 ( to Y.-C .

plastic large cell lymphoma ( 12 , 13 ) , 2 ) IL-9 was shown to be a proliferation inducer and a major anti-apoptotic factor for mouse thymic lymphomas ( 14 , 15 ) , and 3 ) the ratio of occurrence of lymphoma by mutagen or x-ray irradiation increased dramatically in transgenic mice with dysregulated expression of IL-9 ( 16 ) .
Therefore , it is important to unveil the mechanisms of IL-9 gene regulation in the hematopoietic system .
Although it has been shown that the production of IL-9 in T cells can be induced by mitogen phorbol ester or anti-CD3 antibody ( 3 ) , little is known about the control mechanisms of IL-9 expression at the transcriptional level .
Human IL-9 gene has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5 at 5q31-32 ( 17 , 18 ) .
Interestingly , human IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , GM-CSF , and IL-13 gene clusters have also been localized to the same locus ( 19 , 20 ) .
The expression of IL-3 , IL-4 , GM-CSF , and IL-5 has been well studied in a variety of systems .
Certain portions within the promoter regions of these genes were found to be highly conserved , and a common regulatory mechanism was suggested to be involved in the coordinated expression of these cytokines in certain cell types ( 21 , 22 ) .
It was noted that the 5'-flanking region of the IL-9 gene contains several putative transcriptional elements , some of which are also identified in the promoter regions of other cytokine genes mapped to the same chromosomal location ( 3 , 18 ) .
However , unlike other cy-tokines , up to now , the expression of the IL-9 gene has only been detected in T cells .
To understand the basis of the T cell-restricted expression of IL-9 , we undertook the characterization of IL-9 upstream regulatory sequences .
Our previous studies have demonstrated that a 0.9-kilobase Smal-Sacl fragment of the 5'-flanking region of the IL-9 gene contains the DNA sequences required for the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in a human T cell leukemia virus type I-transformed T cell line , C5MJ2 ( 18 ) .
In the present study , we further defined the cis-acting DNA elements and characterized the trans-acting transcription factors involved in IL-9 expression following 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-ace-tate ( TPA ) /phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) stimulation .
By using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis , we identified several DNA sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the IL-9 gene as important regulatory elements .
Several transcription factors , including AP-1 , NF- « B , and potentially novel DNA-binding proteins ( around 35 kDa ) , were found to play critical roles in the regulation of IL-9 gene expression in C5MJ2 cells .

In UV-cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assays , the bromode-oxyuridine and [ °°P ] dCTP were introduced into the double-stranded DNA covering -76 to -58 of the IL-9 5'-flanking sequence as described ( 25 ) .
After a standard DNA and protein binding reaction , the DNA-protein complexes were UV-irradiated for 1 h on ice .
For immunoprecipitation experiments , 4 ug of Abs or normal rabbit IgG were added to each reaction after UV irradiation .
The precipitated and UV-cross-linked proteins were separated on a 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and exposed to x-ray film .
RESULTS Up-regulation of IL-9 Gene Expression in TPA/PHA-stimulated CSMJ2 Cells-The kinetics of TPA/PHA-induced expression of the human IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells was examined by Northern blot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
14 , the steady-state level of the IL-9 mRNA was very low in unstimulated cells and can be transiently increased following TPA/PHA stimulation .
The induction of the IL-9 mRNA by TPA/PHA reached the maximum level 11 h after stimulation and slowly decreased thereafter .
24 h after stimulation , the steady state level of IL-9 mRNA was still about 3 times higher than that in unstimulated cells .
To determine the control mechanisms of IL-9 gene expression after TPA/PHA stimulation , nuclear run-on assays were performed to measure the transcription rate of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells following TPA/PHA treatment ( Fig .
1B ) .
In agreement with the Northern blot analysis , the rate of IL-9 gene transcription was low in unstimulated cells .
The transcription rate of the IL-9 gene was drastically increased ( 7-fold ) 2 h after stimulation , reached the peak ( 10-fold ) at 5 h , and then gradually decreased .
These results , together with the observation that the steady-state level of the IL-9 mRNA peaked at 11 h of induction ( 15.5-fold ) in Northern blot analysis , suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the accumulation of the IL-9 message .
The mRNA induction observed at the first 5 h resulted mainly from the transcriptional activation since both Northern blot and nuclear run-on analyses showed identical induction folds of the IL-9 mRNA ( Fig .
1C ) .
In contrast , a predominantly posttranscriptional event was evidenced at 11 h of activation , suggesting a shift in the mechanisms regulating IL-9 mRNA accumulation from the transcriptional to the posttranscription level , most likely through increasing the stability of the message .
Transcriptional Regulation of IL-9 Gene Expression 5'-Mapping of the IL-9 mRNA-Transcription initiation site for the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells was determined by primer extension and RNase protection methods .
In primer extension experiments , two bands with different densities were observed by using total RNA from activated C5MJ2 cells ( Fig .
2 , lane 6 ) .
The major band ( 82 % ) was 80 bases in length , indicating IL-9 gene transcription mainly initiated at 24 bases upstream from the translation start codon ATG and 25 bases downstream from the TATA box .
The minor band ( 18 % ) , 3 bases longer than the main band , was probably an overextended product .
In RNase protection assays , one protected band was obtained with total RNA from both unstimulated and stimulated cells ( Fig .
2 , lanes 7 and 8 ) following RNase digestion .
The size of the protected fragment corresponds to the size of the major band derived from the primer extension experiment , suggesting that transcription initiates at base 880 ( according to the numbering system in the published human IL-9 genomic sequence ; Ref .
18 ) .
This base is therefore considered as the transcription initiation site of the IL-9 gene and all the IL-9 sequences in this paper will be numbered accordingly .
Our 5'-mapping results were slightly different from the ones mapped in stimulated PBMC cells ( 3 ) , which probably reflect the differences in the control mechanisms of IL-9 gene expression in different cell lines .
Positive and Negative Regulatory Regions in the IL-9 Promot-er-We have demonstrated previously that a 0.9-kilobase 5'-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene was able to direct the reporter gene expression in response to TPA/PHA stimulation in C5MJ2 cells ( 18 ) .
To further identify regions of possible functional significance within this 0.9-kilobase sequence , a series of deletion mutants were constructed for transient expression in C5MJ2 cells .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the expression level of the luciferase reporter gene was steadily increased when the DNA sequence between -878 and -379 was deleted , implying the existence of negative control elements in this region .
The luciferase activity fluctuated between -379 and -143 : the expression level reached the maximum with construct pIL-9-D4 ( -379 ) and decreased about 2-fold with construct pIL-9-D5 ( -299 ) ; After deletion of another 86-base pair sequence ( -213 , pIL-9-D6 ) , the reporter gene expression increased again , especially after TPA/PHA induction ; When an additional 70-base pair sequence was deleted ( -143 , pIL-9-D7 ) , the luciferase activity decreased 5-6-fold .
These results suggested that there are several positive and negative regulatory elements present between -379 and -143 .
Through computer search , several DNA sequences within -379 to -143 were found to be similar to the binding sites of certain known transcription factors .
These sites included a « B-like binding motif at -331 to -317 , an Spl-like site at -317 to -307 , an AP-3-like site at -306 to -298 , and an AP-1-like site at -146 to -140 .
Except the AP-1-like site , none of the other sites were demonstrated to be important in controlling IL-9 gene transcription by mu-tagenesis studies ( data not shown ) .
The AP-1-like site at -146 to -140 was demonstrated to be functional in IL-9 gene expression , since both basal and TPA/PHA-inducible luciferase activities decreased about 2-3-fold when this site was mutated ( Fig .
4A ) .
This AP-1-like site differs from the AP-1 consensus sequence by only one nucleotide .
The nuclear proteins binding to this site were found to be inducible by TPA/PHA stimulation in the gel shift assay ( Fig .
4B , lane 2 ) .
Mutations at this AP-1 site abolished formation of the DNA-protein complexes ( Fig .
4B , lane 3 ) .
These DNA-binding proteins were suggested to be c-Jun and c-Fos by the gel supershift assay , since anti-c-Jun antibody supershifted the retarded band and anti-c-Fos antibody inhibited the formation of the DNA-protein complexes ( Fig .
4B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .

Transcriptional activity of the proximal region between -80 and -47 of the IL-9 gene .
A , deletion analysis of activation region .
Each IL-9 luciferase reporter construct was transiently transfected into C5MJ2 cells , and transfected cells were cultured with or without TPA/PHA stimulation as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
The mean values of three independent experiments are shown .
The number in the bracket corresponds to the position in the 15819 The sequence between -125 and -46 appeared to be essential for the constitutive and TPA/PHA-inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
The construct pIL-9-D9 ( -46 ) showed very low basal level reporter gene expression and failed to respond to TPA induction .
An 8-fold ( uninduced ) and 24-fold ( TPA/PHA-induced ) increase in promoter activity was noted when -125 to -47 sequence was added .
To localize the DNA sequences interacting with nuclear proteins , DNase I footprinting was performed using a 5'-end-labeled probe covering -125 to +7 .
As indicated in Fig .
5 , the region from position -45 to -80 was protected from DNase I digestion , suggesting that DNA-protein interactions exist within this region .
Minimum Sequences for the Basal and Induced Expression of the IL-9 Gene in C5MJ2 Cells-To identify the minimum sequence that mediates the basal and TPA-induced expression of the IL-9 gene , the deletion mutants within the proximal region from -90 to -63 of the IL-9 promoter were constructed .
They were designated as phIL-9-D10 to phIL-9-D13 , beginning at -90 , -80 , -74 , and -63 , respectively .
Transient expression of these constructs in C5MJ2 cells showed that phIL-9-D10 and phIL-9-D11 generated luciferase activities comparable to phIL-9-D8 ( -125 ) , but a 5-10-fold decrease in luciferase activity was observed in transfections with constructs phIL-9-D12 and IL-9-D13 , respectively ( Fig .
6A ) .
Since phIL-9-D9 ( -47 ) had very low level of luciferase expression ( Fig .
3 ) , DNA cis-elements were proposed to be localized in the region between -47 and -80 .
This result is consistent with that of the DNase I footprinting assay .
A closer inspection of the sequences between -47 and -80 revealed two sites highly homologous to the consensus sequences for NF-kB and cAMP response element ( CRE ) .
The NF- « B-like binding motif ( GGGTTTTTCC ) is located at -59 to -50 , and the CRE-like motif ( TGATGTCA ) is immediately upstream from this NF- « B site .
To investigate whether these two sites and their neighboring sequences contribute to the promoter activity , mutations were introduced into these two potential binding sites as well as their adjacent upstream sequences .
As shown in Fig .
6B , any mutation within the NF- « B-like binding motif ( phIL-9-M3 ) , the CRE-like site ( phIL-9-M2 ) or its adjacent 6-base pair upstream sequence ( phIL-9-M1 ) caused a 90 % decrease in the basal level and TPA/PHA-induced expression of the reporter gene .
Simultaneous mutations at these three sites ( phIL-9-M4 ) almost completely abolished the promoter activity .
These results indicated that the three different sites are very important for IL-9 gene expression and they are likely to regulate transcription of the IL-9 gene in a cooperative manner in C5MJ2 cells .
Interactions of Nuclear Proteins with the Proximal Region between -47 and -80 of the IL-9 Promoter-To determine whether NF- « B , CREB , and other transcription factors are involved in the binding to the proximal region between -47 and -80 , the gel shift assays were performed with DNA fragments spanning from -47 to -90 ( Fig .
7A ) .
As shown in Fig .
7B , nuclear extracts from both unstimulated and stimulated cells formed DNA-protein complexes with this sequence .
It was noticed that TPA/PHA stimulation increased the intensity of the major DNA-protein complexes .
To identify individual binding sites , competition experiments were carried out with DNA fragments bearing different binding motifs of several transcrip- IL-9 5'-flanking region at which each clone was truncated .
B , substitution mutation analysis within the proximal region between -80 and -47 .
Substitution mutants were constructed by inserting the PCR fragments between -80 and +8 into pXP2 vectors .
The sequences of wild type and mutation within -80 and -47 in each construct are shown ( dashes , unchanged bases ; underline , NF- « B-like motif ) .
Luciferase activities of C5MJ2 cells transfected with various mutant plasmids are shown as mean values of three independent experiments .

Our data showed that proteins binding to this sequence are specific and the binding could be competed by unlabeled DNA fragment containing human immunodeficiency virus NF- « B motif , but not by unlabeled DNA fragments containing the binding motifs for NF-AT p/c , AP-1 , and CREB ( Fig .
7B ) .
To further characterize proteins binding to this region , gel supershift assays were performed using specific antibodies against NF-kB , CREB , c-Jun , and c-Fos .
As shown in Fig .
7C , NF- « B was demonstrated to be one of the components in the DNA-protein complexes since antibodies raised against both Rel and p50 of NF- « B could supershift the complexes ( lanes 5 and 7 ) and the supershift pattern could be reversed by the addition of excess amount of NF- « B peptides ( lanes 6 and 8 ) .
The anti-c-Jun antibody was also shown to be able to shift the DNA-protein complexes in the supershift assay ( lane 2 ) , but anti-c-Fos and anti-CREB antibodies failed to shift the retarded band .
The CRE-like motif 5TGATGTCA 3 ' at -67 to -60 differs from CRE consensus sequence 5'TGACGTCA 3 ' by a single base substitution .
This variant CRE sequence has been shown to have a markedly reduced binding affinity for CREB ( 32 ) .
Our gel supershift assays and competition experiments also suggested that CRE and CREB may not be involved in the regulation of IL-9 expression .
To characterize proteins binding to the upstream region of the NF- « B site , the UV-cross-linking assay was performed to identify proteins binding to the sequence between -77 and -58 .
As shown in Fig .
7D , several proteins ( around 92 , 40 , and 35 kDa ) from nuclear extract of stimulated cells were cross-linked to the DNA probe ( Zane 2 ) .
UV -cross-linking performed with oligonucleotides mutated at two sites demonstrated to be important by functional studies resulted in the disappearance or decrease in intensity of proteins around 40 and 35 kDa , suggesting that the proteins of 40 and 35 kDa are specific DNA-binding proteins ( Zane 3 ) .
The 40-kDa protein was inducible and was demonstrated to be c-Jun by immunoprecipitation of the UV-cross-linked proteins with anti-c-Jun antibody ( Zane 4 ) .
To further investigate whether proteins binding to the proximal region correlates with regulation of the IL-9 gene expression , we used oligonucleotides with mutations within the NF- « B and its adjacent upstream region as the probes in the gel shift assay ( Fig .
7 , A and E ) .
As compared with wild type sequence , mutations within the NF- « B motif or its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence hindered the DNA-protein complexes formation ( Fig .
7E , lanes 2-4 ) .
Simultaneous mutations of NF- « B and its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence completely abolished the formation of DNA-protein complexes ( Zane 5 ) .
These results correlated well with the functional study ( Fig .
6B ) , in which IL-9 promoter constructs containing the same mutations generated much lower luciferase activities as compared to the wild type construct , demonstrating that synergistic binding of these different transcription factors to the same promoter region is crucial for the expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells .
DISCUSSION In this study , the up-regulation of IL-9 gene expression in C5MJ2 cells was shown to be regulated , at least in part , by 15821 transcriptional activation .
Functional analysis of the 5'-flanking sequence of the IL-9 gene revealed several positive and negative regions controlling IL-9 gene expression .
One positive region includes an AP-1 site at -146 to -140 , which was demonstrated to be involved in the expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells .
Members of the AP-1 protein family have been reported to be involved in the expression of IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , and GM-CSF in T cells by working independently or cooperatively with other transcription factors , such as NF-AT and Oct1 ( 33-37 ) .
In this study , AP-1 protein was found not only to bind to the AP-1 site at -146 to -140 , but also to participate in the formation of DNA-protein complexes binding to another important proximal region ( -80 to -47 ) of the IL-9 promoter .
Therefore , AP-1 appears to be an important general transcription factor involved in the up-regulation of a large number of cytokines in activated T cells .
The second positive regulatory region resides within positions -80 to -47 of the IL-9 promoter .
Our study revealed that this region is absolutely required for IL-9 gene expression .
The DNA sequence within this proximal region is highly conserved in evolution ( identical between human and mouse IL-9 promot-ers ) .
Within this region , an NF- « B motif at -59 to -50 as well as its 20-base pair adjacent upstream sequence were demonstrated to be critical since mutations at one or both sites drastically decreased the promoter activity .
The direct interaction of NF-kB with this region was also confirmed by competition experiments and the gel supershift assay .
NF- « B or related proteins have been shown to play important roles in the expression of several cytokines ( 37-41 ) .
NF- « B is required for the activation of GM-CSF gene by various mitogens in T cells ( 37 , 41 ) .
Unlike GM-CSF gene , the position of this NF- « B motif in IL-9 promoter is located much closer to the TATA box .
Compared with this NF- « B site in the IL-9 promoter , a stretch of DNA sequence referred to as the conserved lymphokin element 0 ( CLEO ) was found in the promoter regions of the GM-CSF , IL-4 , and IL-5 genes ( 22 ) .
CLEO , regarded as an essential cis-element , is required for the expression of GM-CSF , IL-4 , and IL-5 genes in activated T cells and contains composite binding site for AP-1/Ets or NF-AT factors ( 22 , 31 , 37 , 42-43 ) .
The binding sequences for NF-kB , Ets and NF-AT proteins are quite similar , all of which have the AAAGG motif .
The similarity suggests that promoters of those cytokines on chromosome 5 may be evolutionarily related and also raises the possibility that the T cell-restricted expression of IL-9 may be attributed to the unique feature of its promoter sequence .
It should be pointed out that in addition to NF-kB binding to the proximal region between -80 and -47 , c-Jun and the proteins of 35 kDa have also been shown to specifically bind to this functional region .
c-Jun may bind to the CRE-like site at -67 to -60 , since probes with mutations within this CRE-like motif failed to give rise to the supershifted band using anti-c-Jun in our gel supershift assay ( data not shown ) .
The nature of 35-kDa proteins remains unclear .
It was noticed that a GATA binding motif 5'-TGATAC-3 ' exists at position -76 to -71 on the minus strand of the IL-9 promoter , and mutations containing this GATA binding site ( pIL-9-M1 ) reduced reporter gene expression .
At present , four members of GATA family tran B , gel shift assay with oligonucleotide competitors .
50-fold molar excess of competitors were preincubated with nuclear proteins for 5 min before addition of labeled wild type probe ( PW1 ) .
The position of the specific binding complex is indicated by an arrow .
C , gel supershift assay with antibodies and peptide competitors .
For the gel supershift assay , empirically determined amount of Abs and same amount of preimmune serum were preincubated with the nuclear proteins before adding probes ( PW1 ) .
In the corresponding peptide competition assay , 2 ug of the specific peptide was preincubated with Abs before binding reactions .
D , UV-cross-linking studies .
The sequences of upper strand of wild type and mutation probes used in UV-cross-linking study are shown with mutated nucleotides highlighted .
After UV irradiation of the DNA-protein complexes , equal volumes of the same sample were treated either with anti-c-Jun or preimmune IgG , followed by the addition of anti-rabbit-IgG agarose .
The UV-cross-linked proteins and immunoprecipitates were fractionated on a 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
E , gel shift assay with DNA fragments containing substitution mutations .
The position of the specific binding complexes is marked by an arrow .
610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 15822 scription factors have been characterized ( 44-45 ) .
Among them , only GATA-3 is predominantly present in T cells and is involved in the regulation of several T cell-specific genes ( 46-48 ) .
Recently , IL-5 was shown to be activated by GATA-3 in T cells ( 43 ) .
Since the molecular masses of GATA-3 proteins are around 45 kDa , it is unlikely that the 35-kDa UV-cross-linked proteins are GATA-3 .
In summary , our results suggest that synergistic interactions of known and unknown transcription factors are likely to play a critical role in the regulation of IL-9 expression .
As indicated by our study , several proteins can bind to the proximal region between -80 and -47 .
Mutations at different sites within this region not only decreased reporter gene expression but also abolished the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes .
In addition to this important proximal region , we have also demonstrated that the AP-1 site at -146 to -140 can be regulated by AP-1 proteins to enhance IL-9 promoter activity , implying `` cross-talk '' and cooperation may exist between these two regions and among the different transcription factors .
The cooperation of multiple transcription factors has been shown to be involved in the expression of IL-3 , IL-5 , and GM-CSF in T cells ( 37 , 49 ) .
For IL-9 gene expression , its T cell-restricted expression pattern may be mediated by certain unknown T cell-specific transcription factors and/or by a unique profile of combinatorial interactions of common transcription factors .
