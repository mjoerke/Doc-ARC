Box 850 , Hershey , Pennsylvania 17033 Activation of NF- « B by various cellular stimuli involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor , IxBa , although the underlying mechanism remains unclear .
In the present study , the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in the regulation of IxBa phosphorylation was investigated .
Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations ( ~1-5 nm ) of calyculin A or okadaic acid , potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP-1 ) and type 2A ( PP-2A ) , induces the phosphorylation of IxBa even in the absence of any cellular stimulus .
This action of the phosphatase inhibitors , which is associated with the activation of the RelA-p50 NF- « B heterodimer , is not affected by agents that block the induction of IxBa phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) .
Furthermore , the phosphorylated I « Ba from calyculin A-treated cells , but not that from TNF-a-stimulated cells , is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro , suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of IxBa induced by the two different inducers .
However , induction of IxBa phosphorylation by both TNF-a and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of IxBa .
We further demonstrate that TNF-a- and calyculin A-induced IxBa degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor .
Together , these results suggest that phosphorylation of IxBa , mediated through both the TNF-a « -inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases , may serve to target I « Ba for proteasome-mediated degradation .
The NF-kB transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the regulation of various cellular genes involved in the immediate early processes of immune , acute phase , and inflammatory responses ( 1 , 2 ) .
In addition , NF- « B has also been implicated in the transcriptional activation of human viruses , most notably the type 1 human immune deficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) ' ( 3-7 ) .
NF- « B corresponds to a set of hetero- or homodimeric complexes composed of a family of related polypeptides .
In higher vertebrates , this family includes p50 , p52 , RelA ( previously termed p65 ) , RelB , and c-Rel , all of which contain an N-termi-nal domain of homology ( Rel homology domain , ~300 amino *This study was supported in part by American Cancer Society Grant IRG-196 .

In most cell types , the predominant form of NF- « B is a heterodimer composed of p50 and RelA .
This form of NF- « B is normally sequestered in the cytoplasmic compartment by physical association with an inhibitory protein , termed IxBa ( 18 , 19 ) .
Recent studies have revealed that IxBa specifically binds to and masks the nuclear localization signal of RelA , thereby preventing the nuclear translocation of the RelA : p50 NF- « B heterodimer ( 20-23 ) .
The latent cytoplasmic NF- « B complex can be posttransla-tionaly activated by a variety of cellular stimuli , including mitogens like phorbol esters , cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) and interleukin-1 , and the Tax protein from the type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( for a recent review , see Ref .
17 ) .
Activation of NF- « B by these various inducers involves the proteolytic degradation of the inhibitor IxBa , concomitant with the nuclear translocation of the liberated NF-kB heterodimer ( 24-30 ) .
The biologically active nuclear NF-kB complex in turn activates the transcription of a large set of cellular genes encoding not only various factors involved in immune stimulation , inflammation , and cell growth but also the NF- « B inhibitor I « Ba ( 24 , 25 , 31-34 ) .
Thus the nuclear expression of NF- « B is subject to tight control by an autoregulatory feedback mechanism .
Recent studies have suggested that degradation of IxBa appears to be mediated through the proteasome complex ( 85 , 36 ) .
Furthermore , it is likely that the degrading enzymes within the proteasome are constitutively active and that the inducible degradation of IxBa is regulated by the posttranslational modification of IxBa .
Interestingly , the degradation of IkBa , induced by various NF- « B inducers , is preceded by the transient phosphorylation of this cytoplasmic inhibitor ( 30 , 36-39 ) , thus raising the possibility that phosphorylation may serve to target IxBa for subsequent degradation .
In support of this proposal , kinase activators like phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phosphatase inhibitors such as calyculin A and okadaic acid have been shown to induce the nuclear expression of NF- « B ( 40-43 ) .
In the present study , we demonstrate that incubation of the cells with calyculin A or okadaic acid leads to the phosphorylation of I « Ba .
Furthermore , unlike TNF-a , calyculin A induces phosphorylation of IxBa at sites that are sensitive to PP-2A .
However , as observed with TNF-a « , calyculin A-induced phosphorylation of IxBa is also associated with the subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of this inhibitory protein .
These findings suggest that differential phosphorylation of IxBa may target this inhibitor for degradation .

Immunoblotting and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -Jurkat T cells were collected by centrifugation and subjected to preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts ( 44 , 49 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts ( ~15 ug ) were fractionated by reducing 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and then analyzed for immunoreactivity with a peptide-specific antiserum recognizing the C terminus of human I « Ba using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( ECL ; Amersham Corp. ) .
For phosphatase treatment , the extracts were incubated with 0.5 units of the indicated specific serine/threonine phosphatases or 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase at 30 °C for 30 min prior to immunoblotting analysis .
EMSA was performed by incubating the nuclear extracts ( ~3 ug ) with a *°P-radiolabeled high affinity palindromic kB probe , « B-pd ( 45 ) followed by resolving the DNA-protein complexes on native 5 % poly-acrylamide gels .
For antibody `` super shift '' assays , 1 wl of anti-peptide antiserum specifically recognizing each of the NF-kB subunits was added to the EMSA reaction 10 min prior to electrophoresis .
RESULTS Activation of NF-kB by Phosphatase Inhibitors Involves Phosphorylation and Degradation of IrxBa-As described above , the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A induces the nuclear expression of NF- « B in human T cells ( 43 ) .
Using antibody super shift assays , we analyzed the NF-kB species in the kB-binding protein complex .
As shown in Fig .
1A , a major DNA-protein complex was detected by EMSA in the nucleus of calyculin A-treated cells ( Fig .
1A , lane 2 ) .
More importantly , Induction of IkBa Phosphorylation and Degradation incubation of the DNA binding mixtures with either a p50-specific ( lane 4 ) or a RelA-specific ( lane 5 ) antiserum resulted in the supershift of the kB binding complex ( Fig .
14 , arrowheads ) , suggesting the presence of both p50 and RelA in this complex .
In contrast , this NF- « B/DNA complex only slightly immunore-acted with anti-c-Rel ( Zane 6 ) and had no immunoreactivity with either anti-p52 ( lane 7 ) or a control preimmune serum ( lane 3 ) .
These results suggest that calyculin A-induced nuclear NF- « B complex contains predominantly the p50-RelA heterodimer .
To investigate the underlying mechanism of this induction event , studies were performed to test the effect of calyculin A on the fate of IxBa , a major cytoplasmic inhibitor regulating the nuclear expression of the p50-Rel¥A NF-kB heterodimer .
In untreated Jurkat cells , a single 37-kDa form of IxBa was detected with an IxBa-specific antiserum ( Fig .
1B , upper panel , lane 1 ) .
Incubation of the cells with calyculin A ( 25 nm ) for 5 min led to the appearance of a more slowly migrating I « Ba « species ( IxBa* , lane 2 ) , which became the predominant form of IxBa after 15 min of incubation ( lanes 3-5 ) .
The slower mobility of this IxBa species was apparently the result of phosphorylation , since this form could be completely converted to the fast migrating 37-kDa species by in vitro incubation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , calyculin A-induced phosphorylation of IxBa led to the subsequent degradation of this cytoplasmic inhibitor .
Indeed , the preexisting IxBa was almost depleted at 60 min posttreatment ( Fig .
1B , upper panel , lane 5 ) .
Okadaic acid ( 25 nm ) also induced the phosphorylation of IxBa , albeit with delayed kinetics ( 3-8 h , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
These results are consistent with the previous finding that calyculin A and okadaic acid exhibit differential kinetics in the inhibition of cellular phosphatases ( 43 ) .
Parallel EMSA studies revealed that the kinetics of phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa correlated with that of NF- « B nuclear expression in the cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitors ( Fig .
1B , lower panel ) .
Thus , activation of NF- « B by the phosphatase inhibitors is likely mediated through the induction of IkxBa phosphorylation and subsequent degradation .
Calyculin A-induced Phosphorylation of IxBa Is Not Affected by Inhibitors of TNF-a Signaling-Prior studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of IxBa by various NF- « B inducers , such as TNF-a , can be blocked by the chymotrypsin type of protease inhibitors , such as TPCK , and reducing agents like PDTC ( 30 , 36 , 47 ) , suggesting the role of chymotrypsin-like proteases and reactive oxygen species in this signaling path-way .
To explore the signaling pathway involved in the induction of IxBa phosphorylation by the phosphatase inhibitors , the effect of TPCK and PDTC on calyculin A-induced phosphorylation of IxBa was investigated .
As expected , in the absence of these agents , calyculin A induced both the phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa ( Fig .
2 , lanes 2-4 ) .
However , in contrast to that observed with TNF-a ( 30 ) , preincubation of the cells with TPCK did not affect calyculin A-induced phosphorylation of IxBa ( lanes 5-7 ) , although this treatment blocked the subsequent degradation of the IxBa-P ( lanes 5-7 ) .
Furthermore , neither phosphorylation nor degradation of IxBa induced by calyculin A was affected by preincubating the cells with PDTC ( lanes 8 and 9 ) .
These results suggest that induction of IxBa phosphorylation by calyculin A does not involve the signaling steps that require the action of reactive oxygen species or chymotrypsin-like proteases .
A PP-2A-opposing Kinase Appears to Mediate the Phosphorylation of IkBa Induced by Calyculin A but Not That Induced by TNF-a-To further explore the biochemical mechanism underlying the induction of IxBa phosphorylation by the phosphatase inhibitors , the molecular nature of the opposing phosphatases was investigated .

Effect of the chymotrypsin type of TPCK protease inhibitor and the reducing agent PDTC on calyculin A-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa .
Jurkat cells were either untreated ( NT ) ( lane 1 ) or incubated for the indicated time periods with 25 nM calyculin A in the absence ( lanes 2-4 ) or presence of either 50 pM TPCK ( lanes 5-7 ) or 200 um PDTC ( lanes 8 and 9 ) .
For the double treatments , cells were preincubated with either TPCK for 30 min or PDTC for 1 h before adding calyculin A ( Cal A ) to the culture .
Whole-cell extracts were isolated and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with the IxBa-specific antiserum .
okadaic acid have been shown to potently inhibit the PP-2A class of phosphatases at low concentrations is 0.5-1.0 nit ) ( 50 ) .
However , inhibition of PP-1 and PP-2B by okadaic acid requires much higher concentrations ( IC ; , values are 60-200 ni and 10 un , respectively ) .
To explore the phosphatases negatively regulating IxBa phosphorylation , concentration-depend ent induction of IxBa phosphorylation was performed using okadaic acid as inducer .
As shown in Fig .
3A , incubation of the cells with as low as 1 nm okadaic acid led to the appearance of the IxBa-P ( lane 2 ) .
The level of IxBa phosphorylation and subsequent degradation was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner between 1 and 50 nu ( lanes 2-5 ) .
A similar concentration range was observed with calyculin A although the induction of IxBa phosphorylation by this drug was achieved within a shorter time period ( 30 min , data not shown ) as compared with okadaic acid ( 12 h , Fig .
3A ) .
These results indicate that induction of IxBa phosphorylation by these phosphatase inhibitors is probably a result of the inhibition of PP-2A but not PP-1 or PP-2B type phosphatase ( s ) .
To further explore this possibil-ity , protein extracts isolated from calyculin A-treated cells were incubated in vitro with various purified protein phosphatases and then subjected to immunoblotting with the IxBa-specific antiserum ( Fig .
3B ) .
In support of our in vivo results , incubation of the extract with PP-2A ( lane 2 ) but not PP-1 ( lane 3 ) , PP-2B ( lane 5 ) , or a control buffer ( lane 1 ) resulted in the complete conversion of the IxBa-P to its basal form .
A similar result of IxBa dephosphorylation was obtained with okadaic acid-treated cell extract ( data not shown ) .
Together , these in vivo and in vitro results suggest that phosphorylation of IkBa in calyculin A- or okadaic acid-treated cells is likely mediated by a protein kinase ( s ) opposing the action of the PP-2A type of phosphatases .
To examine whether TNF- « -induced phosphorylation of IxBa is also opposed by the action of the PP-2A type of phosphatases , in vitro dephosphorylation assays were performed using a protein extract isolated from TNF-a-stimulated cells and the various serine/threonine phosphatases as well as a control nonspecific alkaline phosphatase , calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( CIP , Fig .
3C , lane 2 ) .
As previously observed ( 49 ) , the more slowly migrating phosphorylated form of IxBa ( IxBa-P ) ( Fig .
3C ) was readily dephosphorylated by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( lane 6 ) .
However , incubation of the extracts with each of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases tested had no effect on this form of IxBa-P ( lanes 3-5 ) , which was in sharp contrast to the dephosphorylation result obtained with calyculin A-induced IxBa-P ( see Fig .
3B ) .

A Proteasome Inhibitor Exhibits a Differential Inhibitory Effect on Calyculin A- and TNF-a-stimulated IkBa Degrada-tion-Proteasome inhibitors , including MG132 ( MyoGenics ) , have been recently shown to inhibit TNF- « -induced degradation of IxBa , suggesting the involvement of the multicatalytic proteasome complex in this degradation event ( 35 ) .
To investigate whether the same type of proteases is also involved in calyculin A-induced degradation of IxBa , the effect of MG132 on IxBa degradation was examined by immunoblotting ( Fig .
4 , upper panel ) in cells treated with either calyculin A ( lanes 2-5 ) or TNF-a ( lanes 7-11 ) .
Preincubation of the cells for 1 h with 25 uM MG132 completely blocked calyculin A-induced degradation of IxBa ( Fig .
4 , upper panel ; compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5 ) as well as the nuclear expression of NF- « B , as determined by a parallel EMSA ( lower panel ) .
Under the same conditions , MG132 also strongly inhibited the degradation of IxBa in cells treated with TNF-a ( Fig .
4 , upper panel ; compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 9 and 10 ) .
However , in contrast to the observation with calyculin A , MG132 failed to completely block the degradation of IxBa induced by TNF- « .
Indeed , even in the presence of MG132 , TNF-a still stimulated slow but significant loss of the IxBa-P ( Fig .
4 , upper panel ; compare lane 9 with lane 10 ) .
Remarkably , along with the degradation of IxBa-P , a small peptide ( ~20 kDa ) appeared in the cells and was detected in the immunoblotting with the anti-peptide antiserum reacting 10 20 3 4 5 678|9|1|01|1 IxBa-P e 2 IxBa mame meses < 4- Is Bo- C e 1 “ w _ , -- ~ complex e sz p o ntr 4 % '' 3 8 % *s % , .

Effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on the degradation of IxBa .
Jurkat T cells were either untreated ( lanes 1 and 6 ) or incubated with 50 nm calyculin A ( Cal A ) ( Zanes 2 and 3 ) or 10 ng/ml TNF-a ( lanes 7 and 8 ) for the indicated time intervals .
For the double treatments , cells were preincubated for 1 h with the indicated amount of MG132 and then further incubated for the indicated time periods in the presence of calyculin A ( lanes 4 and 5 ) or TNF- « ( lanes 9-13 ) .
Whole-cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with the peptide-specific antiserum recognizing the C terminus of IxBa .
IxBa-C is likely a degradation product containing the C terminus of IxBa .
This small fragment was also detected with a different antiserum recognizing the C terminus of IxBa ( data not shown ) .
with the C terminus of I « kBa ( Zane 10 , IxBa-C ) .
This peptide was apparently the C-terminal degradation product of IxBa since it could also be detected by a different antiserum specific for the C-terminal peptide of IxBa ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , the generation of this degradation product was likely mediated through a protease insensitive to MG132 , since the appearance of this small peptide was not affected even in the presence of higher amounts of MG132 ( 50 un , lane 11 , and 75 un , data not shown ) .
Parallel EMSA studies revealed that MG132 also failed to completely block TNF- « induction of the nuclear expression of NF-kB ( Fig .
4 , lower panel ; compare lanes 7 and 8 and lanes 9-11 ) .
Calyculin A and TNF-a Exhibit Synergistic Action in the Induction of IkBa Degradation and Activation of NF- « B-In view of the differential induction of IxBa phosphorylation by TNF-a and calyculin A , we next investigated whether these two inducers had synergistic action on the induction of IxBa degradation and nuclear expression of NF-kB .
For these studies , Jurkat T cells were stimulated with either TNF-a alone ( Fig .
5 , lanes 2-6 ) or TNF-a together with calyculin A ( lanes 8-12 ) .
Degradation of IxBa and nuclear expression of NF-kB were detected by immunoblotting ( upper panel ) and EMSA ( lower panel ) , respectively .
As expected , incubation of the cells with TNF-a led to the transient appearance of the IkxBa-P and the gradual degradation of this inhibitor ( Fig .
5 , upper panel , lanes 2-6 ) , which was concomitant with the nuclear expression of NF- « B ( lower panel ) .
Under these conditions ( 10 ng of TNF- « /7 X 10° cells/ml ) , TNF- « stimulation for 30 min led to the degradation of only about 50 % of the IxBa molecules ( compare lane 1 with lane 6 ) .
Remarkably , costimulation of the cells with both TNF- « and calyculin A markedly enhanced the rate of IxBa degradation ( upper panel , lanes 8-12 ) .
Significant loss of IxBa was detected as early as 10 min after stimulation ( Zane 10 ) , and the entire intracellular pool of IxBa was almost depleted at 30 min ( Zane 12 ) .
Furthermore , the enhanced rate of IxBa degradation was associated with the more rapid and remarkably higher level of NF-kB nuclear expression ( Fig .
5 , lower panel , compare lanes 2-6 with lanes 8-12 ) .
Of note , under the same conditions , depletion of IxBa by calyculin A alone required at least 60 min ( see Fig .

Synergy between calyculin A ( Cal A ) and TNF-a in the induction of IxBa degradation and NF-kB nuclear expression .
Jurkat cells were incubated with either TNF-a ( 10 ng/ml ) alone ( lanes 2-6 ) or TNF- « together with 25 nM calyculin A ( lanes 8-12 ) for the indicated time periods .
Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with the IxBa-specific antiserum ( upper panel ) and EMSA using the *°P-labeled « B probe ( lower panel ) , respectively .
inhibitor calyculin A and the cytokine TNF-a have synergistic activity in the induction of IkxBa degradation and NF- « B nuclear expression .
DISCUSSION The nuclear expression and biological function of the NF-kB transcription factor are tightly regulated through its cytoplasmic retention by the ankyrin-rich inhibitor I « Ba ( 20-23 ) .
Activation of NF-kB by various cellular stimuli involves the proteolytic degradation of IxBa and the concomitant nuclear translocation of the liberated NF-kB heterodimer ( 24-30 ) .
Although the biochemical mechanism underlying the degradation of IxBa remains unclear , it appears that degradation of IxBa induced by various mitogens and cytokines occurs in association with the transient phosphorylation of IxBa ( 30 , 36-39 ) .
In the present study , we have demonstrated that the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors , calyculin A and okadaic acid , also induce the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IxBa .
Induction of IxBa phosphorylation by okadaic acid can be achieved at low concentrations ( 1-5 nit ) , at which PP-2A , but not other phosphatases including PP-1 and PP-2B , is able to be inhibited ( 48 ) .
These findings suggest that the action of okadaic acid , and probably also calyculin A , is mediated through the inhibition of the cellular PP-2A type of phosphatases .
In support of this notion , the IkxBa-P produced in both calyculin A-and okadaic acid-treated cells can be readily dephosphorylated in vitro by PP-2A but not by PP-1 or PP-2B .
This result further suggests that phosphorylation of IxBa may be directly mediated by a PP-2A-opposing protein kinase .
However , from our current studies , we are not certain whether the activation of the IxBa kinase is a direct result of PP-2A inhibition or is mediated through an indirect mechanism that , for example , may involve the activation of the upstream signaling molecules .
A previous study has shown that activation of NF-kB by okadaic acid can be partially inhibited by the antioxidant cys-teine , suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species in this induction process ( 42 ) .
However , our present study is not in full agreement with these previous findings .
We have demonstrated that induction of the phosphorylation as well as subsequent degradation of IxBa by calyculin A ( 25 nm ) is not appreciably inhibited by PDTC , a potent antioxidant that blocks TNF-a-induced degradation of IxBa and nuclear expression of NF-kB ( 25 , 50 ) .
This discrepancy is likely due to the much higher concentration ( 2 ux ) of the phosphatase inhibitors used in the previous study .
At this concentration , both calyculin A and okadaic acid will nonspecifically inhibit most types of the serine/threonine phosphatases ( 48 ) , which may in turn trigger additional , perhaps antioxidant-sensitive , signaling Induction of IxBa Phosphorylation and Degradation pathways .
In support of this proposal , okadaic acid has been shown to synergize the action of H , O , only at high concentrations ( 2 uM ) ( 42 ) .
Furthermore , a more recent study using a low concentration of calyculin A and okadaic acid has revealed that activation of NF- « B by these phosphatase inhibitors is indeed insensitive to antioxidants ( 43 ) .
We have also shown that induction of I « xBa phosphorylation by calyculin A is not inhibited by TPCK , a potent inhibitor of the chymotrypsin type of proteases that blocks TNF- « w-induced IxBa phosphorylation ( 30 , 36 ) .
Together , these findings suggest that induction of IxBa phosphorylation by the phosphatase inhibitors may either bypass the signaling steps that are sensitive to TPCK and antioxidants or involve a signaling pathway that is different from that triggered by TNF- « .
Our data favor the latter possibility .
We have shown that the IxBa « -P produced in TNF-a-treated cells can not be dephosphorylated in vitro by PP-2A , although under the same conditions this phosphatase proves to be efficient in removing the phosphate from calyculin A-induced IxBa-P .
Thus , phosphorylation of IxBa induced by these two different NF- « B inducers may be mediated by distinct kinases .
However , a more conclusive answer to this question awaits the precise determination of the phosphorylation sites within these two types of I « Ba-P .
Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibition of IxBa degradation by certain proteasome inhibitors leads to the accumulation of the IxBa-P ( 36-39 ) , thus raising the possibility that phosphorylation of IxBa may target this inhibitor for degradation by the proteasome .
In this regard , one potential model may involve phosphorylation serving as a molecular trigger to alter the conformation of IkBa , thus facilitating the action of the constitutively active proteases .
According to this scenario , phosphorylation of IxBa on different sites can cause distinct conformational changes , which may in turn lead to the differential sensitivities of IxBa to the cellular proteases .
Indeed , this outcome has been observed in our experiments .
Spe-cifically , calyculin A-induced degradation of IxBa can be completely blocked in the presence of 25 um MG132 , suggesting the involvement of solely the MG132-sensitive proteases in this degradation process .
In contrast , TNF- « -induced IxBa degradation appears to involve additional proteases that are insensitive to MG132 .
In the presence of up to 75 um of MG132 , partial degradation of IxBa still occurs in TNF-a-stimulated cells , which leads to the accumulation of a small degradation product ( ~20 kDa ) containing the C terminus of IxBa .
Of course , it remains a possibility that calyculin A and TNF-a both induce IxBa kinases and up-regulate cellular proteases , which act coordinately to eliminate IxBa .
Nevertheless , from our current studies , we can not conclude that phosphorylation targets IkBa for degradation .
Studies are in progress to precisely map the phosphorylation sites within the I « xBa-P , which will allow us to determine the biological importance of phosphorylation in the degradation of IxkBa « .
