HEMATOPOIESIS Differential requirement for the transcription factor PU.1 in the generation of natural killer cells versus B and T cells Francesco Colucci , Sandrine I. Samson , Rodney P. DeKoter , Olivier Lantz , Harinder Singh , and James P. Di Santo PU.1 is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors required for the development of various lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages , but its role in natural killer ( NK ) cell development is not known .
The study shows that PU.1 is expressed in NK cells and that , on cell transfer into alymphoid /-mice , hematopoietic progenitors of PU.1- '' -fetal liver cells could generate functional NK cells but not B or T cells .
Nevertheless , the numbers of bone marrow NK cell precursors and splenic mature NK cells were reduced compared to controls .
Moreover , PU.1~ '' - NK cells displayed reduced expression of the receptors for stem cell factor and interleukin ( IL ) -7 , suggesting a nonredun-dant role for PU.1 in regulating the expression of these cytokine receptor genes during NK cell development .
PU.1- '' ~ NK cells also showed defective expression of inhibi- tory and activating members of the Ly49 family and failed to proliferate in response to IL-2 and IL-12 .
Thus , despite the less stringent requirement for PU.1 in NK cell development compared to B and T cells , PU.1 regulates NK cell differentiation and homeostasis .
( Blood .
2001 ; 97:2625-2632 ) ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Natural killer ( NK ) cells are a distinct subset of lymphocytes that mediate important functions in innate immunity being able to eliminate tumor cells and to produce cytokines without prior sensitization ( reviewed in Trinchieri ' ) .
NK cells can distinguish cells with disparate levels of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I expression , killing cells that , due to viral infections or transformation , have low MHC expression , and sparing those with normal expression ( reviewed in Ljunggren and Karre ? ) .
Such discrimination is mediated by self MHC-specific inhibitory receptors on NK cells that belong to one of 3 groups : killer immunoglobu-lin-like receptors on human NK cells , lectin-like Ly49 receptors on murine NK cells , and lectin-like NKG2/CD94 cells that are found on both human and rodent NK cells ( reviewed in Lanier '' ) .
Despite our appreciation of these different NK cell functions , the developmental relationship of NK cells with other hematopoietic lineages is not clear .
A rare population of common lymphoid progenitors ( CLPs ) that can give rise to T , B , and NK cells has been identified in mouse bone marrow ( BM ) , and NK and T cells have been suggested to derive from a common progenitor during fetal life . '' ''
NK and T cells also share expression of several differentiation antigens and effector functions , yet the great majority of T cells are generated in the thymus , whereas the predominant site for NK cell development is the BM .
Part of the difficulty in understanding the developmental relationship of NK cells with other hematopoietic lineages stems from our incomplete knowledge of NK cell ontogeny .
Notwithstand-ing , it is now clear that development of NK cells is strictly dependent on cytokines that promote survival , proliferation , and differentiation .
Interleukin ( IL ) -15 plays a pivotal role in NK cell differentiation , thus NK cells are extremely reduced or absent in mice deficient for IL-15 '' or for any of the IL-15 receptor subunits ( IL-15Ra,8 IL-2RB , ° or its downstream signaling molecules Jak3* and Stat5 . ''
However , IL-15 intervenes in a rather late stage of development , when the commitment to the NK cell lineage has already been made .
Although `` early acting '' cytokines , including IL-7 , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , and FIkK2L/FIt3L , are best candidates for driving the commitment to the NK cell lineage ( reviewed in Williams et al '' '' ) , the relative contribution of these growth factors is not fully appreciated .
Therefore , the molecular mechanisms marking NK cell specification are not completely understood .
It is conceivable that these cytokines activate genetic programs that use multiple transcription factors to silence or to activate lineage-specific genes .
However , although the transcriptional regulation of lineage commitment during lymphopoiesis has been quite extensively studied in the context of B- and T-cell development ( reviewed in Glimcher and Singh '' ) , the transcription factors that control engagement to the NK cell lineage have only recently started to be identified .
Mice deficient for interferon regulatory factor-1 fail to develop NK cells , due to impaired transcriptional activation of the 115 locus . ''
The absence of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein y ( CREB-y ) impinges selectively on NK cell development and not on B or T lymphopoiesis . ' ''
Disruption of the 1d2 gene results in the block of NK cell development , whereas Band T-cell differentiation unfolds normally . ' ''
The further understanding of the transcriptional regulation of NK cells may help to define stages in which lineage specification takes place , thereby clarifying the developmental relationship of NK cells with B- and T-cell lineages .

2626 - COLUCCl etal The Ets ( E26 transformation specific ) family of oncogenic transcription factors comprises more than 20 members that are conserved throughout evolution , regulating cell fate of multiple cell types in worms , flies , birds , and mammals ( reviewed in Bassuk and Leiden ' '' ) .
Several mammalian Ets transcription factors are expressed in the hematopoietic system .
Gene-targeting experiments have helped to define the role of these transcription factors in mouse hematopoietic development .
One Ets family member , PU.1 ( purine rich box-1 ) or Spi-1 ( spleen focus-forming virus integration site-1 ) is required for the differentiation of multiple hematopoietic lineages . ' '' ''
Although specification of erythrocytes and megakaryo-cytes can occur in the absence of PU.1 , monocytes , mature granulocytes , myeloid-derived dendritic cells , and B lymphocytes fail to develop in PU.1I~~- mice . ''
T-cell development is also strongly affected , with few or no T cells developing in PU.1~~-mice '' or in fetal thymic organ culture . '' ''
In contrast , because PU.1~ '' ~ mice die at E17.5 during embryonic life '' '' or just after birth , '' '' the role of PU.1 in NK cell differentiation has not been examined .
To overcome this limitation , we utilized a recently developed complementation system in which fetal liver ( FL ) cells are used as a source of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) to reconstitute alymphoid Rag2/yc- '' ~- mice .
In these hematopoietic chimeras , all lymphoid cells are donor derived . ''
We found that PU.1~~-Rag2/yc `` - hematopoietic chimeras were essentially devoid of B and T cells , whereas NK cells could be generated .
Thus , despite sharing a close developmental relationship , B , T , and NK cells are differentially dependent on PU.1 for their generation .
Materials and methods Mice and generation of FL hematopoietic chimeras Mice with a null mutation in the common y chain were from the fourth generation backcross to the C57BI1/6 background .
Rag2~ mice ( 10th backcross to C57B1/6 ) were bred with B10.BR ( H-25 ) , and F1 progeny were intercrossed to generate RAG-2-deficient mice on the H-2 « background .
These mice were then bred with Rag2/yc '~ mice to generate Rag2/yc '~ mice carrying the H-2 « haplotype .
PU.1~ '' +* mice ! ''
( C57B1/6 X 129 , H-2 '' ) were screened by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , using genomic DNA and specific primers for PU.1 and Neo gene ( 5'-CGG ATG TGC TTC CCT TAT CAA AC-3 '' , 5'-TGA CTT TCT TCA CCT CGC CTG TC-3 ' , 5-CAG AAA GCG AAG GAG CAA AGC TG-3 ' ) .
PU.1* '' ~ mice were intercrossed .
to generate PU.1~ '' ~ and control ( PU.1+* '' * , or PU.1* '' ~ , thereafter referred to as WT ) embryos .
The morning of the vaginal plug discovery was designated as day 0.5 of gestation .
FL cells were obtained from day 15.5 embryos by passage of the tissue through a 23-gauge needle , and the genotypes were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis , using antibodies specific for Mac-1 ( macrophages fail to develop in PU.1~~ embryos ) '' Rag2/ye '~ mice on H-2 « background ( > 6 weeks of age ) were irradiated with 300 rads from a cobalt source and 2 hours later injected intravenously with 8 , 25 , or 75 X 10° FL cells as a source of hematopoietic progenitors , including HSCs , which we will refer to as FL-HSCs .
Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting Single cell suspensions were prepared from blood , thymus , BM , spleen , and liver .
Erythrocytes were lysed in ammonium chloride , and cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 % bovine serum albumin and 0.01 % sodium azide .
Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion .
Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) directly conjugated to fluores-cein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) , phycoerythrin ( PE ) , Tricolor ( TRI ) , allophyco-cyanin ( APC ) , or biotin were used for immunofluorescence analysis , including mAbs specific for immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) , IgD , T-cell receptor BLOOD , 1 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 9 aB ( TCReB ) , TCRy8 , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD11a ( LFA-1 ) , CD11b ( Mac-1 ) , CD19 , CD45R ( B220 ) , CD90 ( Thy-1.2 ) , CD117 ( c-kit ) , CD122 ( IL-2RfB ) , CD161 ( NK1.1 ) , DX5 , 2B4 , Ly49A , Ly49C/I , Ly49D , Ly49G2 , Gr-1 , TER-119 , and H-2* ( all from Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) .
Biotin-conjugated mAbs were revealed by streptavidin-TRI ( Caltag , Burlingame , CA ) .
Cells ( 10° ) were first incubated with anti-FeyRI/III ( hybridoma 24G2 ) for 20 minutes on ice to avoid unspecific binding to low affinity FcRs .
Thereafter , cells were stained with a mixture of biotinylated and fluorochrome-labeled mAbs at saturating concentrations , washed twice , and finally incubated with streptavidin-TRL .
To evaluate rare BM progenitor populations , 20 X 106 cells were incubated with purified rat mAbs for lineage ( Lin ) markers ( CD11b , CD19 , TER-119 , and Gr-1 ) on ice for 20 minutes .
After washing , cells were incubated with goat antirat IgG coupled with magnetic beads ( Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) , and the majority of Lin* cells were removed on a magnet .
Cells were then stained with H-2 « ( to detect host-derived cells ) , washed , and incubated with mAbs specific for rat IgG , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , and B220 ( all coupled with TRI ) .
TRI+* cells were subsequently electronically gated , thereby excluding Lin* and host-derived precursors .
Analysis was performed on a FACScan or FACScalibur flow cytometer , using the Cellquest software ( Becton Dickinson , San Diego , CA ) .
Dead cells were excluded by means of their forward and side scatters , and an electronic gate was set to acquire 10+ lymphoid cells .
Cells derived from the host were excluded from the analysis by electronic gating .
To purify splenic NK cells , cell suspensions were stained with mAbs specific for NK1.1 , and CD3 and NK cells ( CD3-NK1.1* ) were sorted using a FACStar+ ( Becton Dickinson ) .
The purity of the sorted populations was reproducibility greater than 95 % .
NK cell lytic activity A standard *'Cr release assay was used to measure NK lytic activity in vitro as described . `` ?
YAC-1 cells ( mouse thymoma ; H-2* ) were used as target cells and were maintained in complete medium ( CM ; RPMI-1640 with 10 % fetal calf serum , 105 M B-ME , 100 mg/mL streptomycin , 100 U/mL penicillin ) .
Target cells were labeled with 100 Ci 5'Cr ( ICN Pharmaceuti-cal , Costa Mesa , CA ) , and 2.5 to 5 X 10° cells were incubated with graded numbers of effector cells in 200 .L medium for 4 hours .
Effector cells were either NK cells that were isolated from splenocytes by cell sorting or IL-2-activated NK cell cultures .
The radioactivity released into the cell-free supernatant was measured , and the percentage of specific lysis was calculated as follows : 100 X ( experimental release - spontaneous release ) / ( maximum release - spontaneous release ) .
Reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blotting RNA was isolated from freshly sorted NK cell populations with RNABle ( EUROBIO , Les Ulis , France ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Complementary DNA was synthesized , using reverse transcriptase ( RT ) from avian myeloblastosis virus ( PROMEGA , Madison , WI ) , hexanucleo-tides , and oligo-dT ( Amersham Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
PCR was performed , using Taq Platinum polymerase ( GIBCO BRL ) .

Cell-cycle analysis Cell-cycle analysis was performed on in vitro IL-2-activated NK cells and on circulating CD3-NK1.1+ % NK cells from peripheral blood , using 7-aminoactinomycin-D ( 7-AAD ) incorporation into saponin-permeabilized cells as described . ''
Sorted splenic CD3-NK1.1* cells were plated at 10+ cells/well in round-bottom microtitre plates in 200 L CM and activated with 1000 U/mL hulL-2 ( Peprotech , Rocky Hill , NJ ) for 7 days .
To stimulate NK cell proliferation and to promote subsequent activation-induced cell death , 2 ng/mL mIL-12 ( Peprotech ) was added during the final 48 hours before the cell-cycle analysis .
Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with the Microsoft Excel software , applying the paired Student £ test .
The null hypothesis was rejected , and difference was assumed significant when P < .05 .
Results Expression of PU.1 in NK cells Previous studies have assessed PU.1 expression in CLPs , immature B- and T-cell precursors , and mature B cells.2 > '' 2 '' However , little is known about PU.1 expression in NK cells and its putative role during NK cell differentiation .
We , therefore , tested and found PU.1 protein in cell lysates derived from sorted NK cells expanded in IL-2 ( Figure 1 ) .
As expected , PU.1 was also found in control lysates derived from total splenocytes and pre-B cells but not in thymocyte lysates ( Figure 1 ) .
Thus , mature NK cells , like B cells and unlike T cells , maintain PU.1 expression throughout development .
Lymphoid cell development in the absence of PU.1 To address the role of PU.1 in NK cell development in vivo , we generated hematopoietic chimeras by injecting PU.I~~- or WT FL-HSCs ( H-2 '' ) into alymphoid Reg2/yec-~ ( H-28 ) mice .
In this system , '' '' all lymphoid cells are donor derived , and any host-derived cell can be identified by virtue of their differential H-2 expression .
Because PU.1~ '' ~- FL cells are known to contain fewer hematopoietic progenitors than control cells , '' '' the reconstitution capacity of 3 different doses ( 8 X 10° , 25 X 10° , or 75 X 10° ) of Table 1 .
Splenic cellularity ( cell numbers x 105 ) NK CELLS IN PU.1~- MICE _ 2627 FL-HSCs from PU.I~ '' ~ embryos was analyzed and compared to WT controls .
Seven to 13 weeks after the transfer , chimeras were killed , and the lymphoid cellularity in thymus , BM , spleen , and liver was evaluated .
Splenic T cells ( CD3*+NK1.1~ ) were virtually absent in PU.1~ '' ~ chimeras ( Table 1 ) , and the thymi of PU.1~ '' -chimeras were hypocellular , containing almost exclusively early CD4-CD8~ double-negative thymocytes ( Figure 2 ) .
However , in very rare PU.1~ '' ~ chimeras , we could detect the 4 populations of CD4* , CD4*CD8* , CD8* , and CD4-CD8~ thymocytes ( data not shown ) , consistent with a variable penetrance of the T-cell-deficiency phenotype . ''
B220+IgM*+* B cells were absent in the spleen ( Table 1 ) and BM of PU.1~~- chimeras ( Figure 2 ) , confirming the essential role of PU.1 in B-cell differentiation. ! ''
In contrast with the T- and B-cell deficiency , CD3-NK1.1+* NK cells were present in spleen , liver , and BM of all PU.1~ '' ~ chimeras analyzed ( n = 16 ) , although they were reduced in absolute numbers compared to controls ( n = 11 ; Table 1 ) .
The kinetics of peripheral NK cell generation in the absence of PU.1 was somewhat slower than controls ( data not shown ) , a phenomenon already described for the in vivo generation of T cells in the viable PU.1- '' ~- strain '' '' and the in vitro generation of lymphoid-derived PU.1- '' ~ dendritic cells . '' ''
The data in Table 1 demonstrate that by injecting more PU .
] I~~- FL-HSCs , more NK cells could be generated , but the NK cell numbers in PU.I~ '' ~ chimeras never reached those found in WT chimeras .
Thus , 10-fold less PU.1~ '' ~-NK cells were present in the spleens of chimeras generated with 8 X 10° FL-HSC 's , but only 3- to 4-fold less PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells were present in the spleens of PU.1~ '' ~ chimeras generated with 25 X 10° FL-HSCs .
However , T- and B-cell numbers did not significantly increase with higher doses of FL-HSCs and remained 400- to 6000-fold reduced compared to controls .
The numbers of NK cells generated with even higher doses of FL-HSCs ( 75 X 10° ) were not greater than those obtained by injecting 25 X 10° FL-HSC 's ( Table 1 and data not shown ) , suggesting that the reduction of NK cells in PU.1~ '' ~ chimeras is not only due to the reduced frequency of progenitors in the FL of PU.I~ '' ~ embryo donors .
These results clearly demonstrate that NK cell development is permissive in the absence of PU.1 .
Reduced production of early NK cell precursors in the absence of PU.1 HSCs of PU.1~~ embryos fail to express VLA-4/CD49d~ VLA-5/CD49e-CD11b integrins that has been hypothesized to result in defective homing to the BM . ''
To directly test whether defects in engraftment of PU.1~ '' ~- FL-HSCs in the adult BM could explain the lower numbers of NK cells in PU.1~ '' ~-chimeras , we searched for donor-derived HSCs 8 weeks post-transfer .
These cells are contained in a population of BM cells that is negative for the host H-2 % , does not express lineage-specific markers ( including CD19 , B220 , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , Gr-1 , Mac-1 , TER-119 , and NK 1.1 ) , and is positive for both Sca-1 and FL cells NK cells T cells B cells FL-HSC* injected Totalt ( NK1.1+CD3- ) ( NK1.1-CD3+ ) ( B220+IgM* ) n WT 8 518 + 147 5.2 £1 75.7 * 1.3 267 + 111 7 PU .

An electronic gate based on mor-phologic criteria was set to exclude most nonlymphoid cells .
An example of the gating strategy for lymphoid cell analysis in the spleen is shown .

We found HSCs ( Sca-1* , c-kit* , Lin- , and H-2~ ) in PU.1~ '' ~ chimeras ( Figure 3A ) and the presence of donor-derived CD45 * cells at 16 weeks post-transfer ( data not shown ) .
These results rule out a major defect in engraftment or homing of FL-HSC 's in PU.1~ '' ~- chimeras .
Collectively , these observations suggest that PU.1 plays an intrinsic and essential role in early NK cell differentiation .
We have recently identified a cell population in murine BM that appears to represent a committed NK cell precursor ( NKP ) , having lost any potential for B , T , or myeloid differentiation ( E. Rosmaraki et al , manuscript submitted ) .
NKPs are Lin~ and share IL-2RB+* expression with mature NK cells , but in contrast they do not express NK1.1 or DX5 .
Eight to 10 weeks after the transfer , we enumerated these Lin- IL-2RB+* NK1.1-DX5 NKPs in WT and PU.1~-chimeras .
NKPs were 10- to 12-fold reduced in the BM of PU.1~ '' -chimeras ( Figure 3B , C ) .
This observation suggests that PU.1~ '' ~-hematopoietic progenitors can only poorly generate the early NK cell compartment .
Accordingly , the numbers of NK cells in older PU.1~- '' ~ chimeras ( > 30 weeks ; n = 5 ) decline with age to almost undetectable levels ( data not shown ) .
Characterization of PU.1- '' - NK cells The development of hematopoietic progenitors is associated with dynamic changes in the expression of a number of transcription factors .
`` * '' '' The transcription factors Ets-1 and Id2 have been shown to be crucial for NK cell development . '' ''
present in all chimeras analyzed .
Data are from representative of 8 independent experiments .
PU.1-F- Figure 4A shows that PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells express Id2 transcripts and , interestingly , up-regulate expression of Ets-1 compared to control NK cells .
We further analyzed the cell surface phenotype of the splenic NK cells that developed in the absence of PU.1 .
A series of differentiation antigens , including NK1.1 , DX5 , CD2 , 2B4 , Mac-1 , and Thy-1 , were expressed at expected frequencies in PU.1~ '' - NK cells and at levels comparable to those of controls ( Figure 4B and data not shown ) .
The LFA-1 complex is expressed on all leukocytes and is composed of CD11a and CD18 integrins .
CD11la is a putative target gene of PU.1,5 > 2 nevertheless PU.1~- NK cells expressed normal levels of LFA-1 ( Figure 4B ) .
Mature NK cells express inhibitory and activating members of the Ly49 family of receptors that recognize MHC class I antigens on the surface of target cells and play a critical role in regulating NK cell cytotoxic activity ( reviewed in Raulet '' '' ) .
PU.1~ '' ~ chimeras contained normal percentages of splenic NK cells expressing the inhibitory receptors Ly49C/I and Ly49G2 ( Figure 4B ) .
However , the NK cell fractions expressing the inhibitory receptor Ly49A and the activating receptor Ly49D were clearly underrepresented in PU.1~ '' - NK cells ( Figure 4B ) .
Along these lines , the Ly49a locus has been shown to contain a consensus PU.1 binding site ( E. Hofer , 18th International NK Cell Workshop , Marseille , France , May 2000 ) .

Finally , we failed to generate NK cells in vitro from PU.1~ '' ~- FL cells ( data not shown ) , using a combination of cytokines ( SCF , FIkK2L/FIt3L , IL-7 , and IL-2 ) that drives NK cell differentiation with high efficiency from WT FL cells . ''
Together , these results indicate that PU.1~ '' - NK cells have defective responses to cytokines .
Expression of growth factor receptors on PU.1- '' ~- NK cells PU.1 has been implicated in the regulation of cytokine receptor genes . ''
Developing NK cell precursors rely on FIk2L/FIH3L , SCF , IL-7 , and IL-15 to survive , proliferate , and differentiate ( reviewed in Williams et al ' '' ) .
The receptor for IL-7 is expressed during the early lymphopoiesis , and transcripts for the IL-7Ra chain are also found in mature NK cells ( Figure 6A ) .
However , PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells failed to express IL-7Ra .
Interactions of SCF with its c-kit receptor are essential for expansion of NK cell precursors and full maturation of NK cells . ?
A small subset of mature NK cells express the c-kit receptor , but this subset was 6- to 7-fold reduced in PU.1~ '' -NK cells ( Figure 6B ) .

Signaling through the IL-15 receptor is crucial to drive NK cell development . '' ''
This tripartite receptor is composed of the IL-15Ra , IL-2RB , and yc chains ( the latter 2 are shared with the IL-2 receptor and can signal in response to high doses of IL-2 ) .
In line with the capacity of IL-2 to promote survival of PU.1~ '' ~- NK cells ( Figure 5B ) , essentially all of these cells expressed IL-2RB and contained RNA transcripts for IL-15Ra « and y , , ( Figure 6B and data not shown ) .
Lytic activity of PU.1- '' - NK cells We have previously observed a correlation between reduced expression of B220 and defective lytic activity in c-kit'~ NK cells . ''
Because B220 and c-kit expression were reduced in PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells , we assessed the capacity of freshly isolated splenic PU.1~~ NK cells to lyse YAC-1 thymoma targets in a standard 5'Cr release assay .
As shown in Figure 7 , PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells were fully competent in lysing this NK-sensitive target .
In addition , IL-2-activated PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells could kill both YAC-1 and P815 targets ( data not shown ) .
These results show that differentiation of the lytic machinery for natural cytolysis does not require PU.1 .
Discussion In this report , we demonstrate that NK cells like B but not T lymphocytes express PU.1 , but this transcription factor is not strictly required for the generation of functional NK cells in vivo .
Our studies made use of a novel alymphoid mouse strain , Rag2/ye ~ mice , which were reconstituted with PU.1~ '' - FL hematopoietic progenitors .
In this setting , B-cell , T-cell , and NK cell development is entirely donor derived , and little or no competition with endogenous early lymphoid precursors is observed . ''
Moreover , the potentially lethal effects associated with defective granulocyte and macrophage development in the absence of PU.1 are avoided since these hematopoietic lineages develop normally in Rag2/yc- '' ~ mice . ''
This genetic approach allowed us to assess the role of PU.1 in NK differentiation .
PU.1~~ chimeras remain B and T cell deficient but generate BM precursors and peripheral functional NK cells , although both are reduced in numbers .
We show here that NK cells maintain expression of PU.1 throughout differentiation .

Data from 2 separate experiments are shown .
BLOOD , 1 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 9 PU.1~ '' - NK cells displayed phenotypical abnormalities , such as reduced expression of certain surface antigens , including the receptors for IL-7 and SCF , and defective proliferative responses to potent NK cell mitogens , such as IL-2 and IL-12 .
However , PU.1- '' - NK cells could mediate natural cytotoxicity and survive in vitro on stimulation with IL-2 .
Taken together , our results demonstrate a differential requirement of PU.1 for NK versus B- and T-cell lymphopoiesis .
How do we explain the partial effects of PU.1 deficiency on NK cell differentiation in the context of the known roles that this transcription factor plays during hematopoiesis ?
PU.1 expression appears to be regulated in a complex and dynamic fashion throughout the hematopoietic system .
PU.1 is expressed in HSCs and in common myeloid progenitors and in CLPs .
`` ® Although the precise effects of PU.1 deficiency on these hematopoietic subsets remain to be determined , PU.1 is not required for the generation of HSCs , since this cell subset could be detected after cell transfer of PU./~ '' ~ FL precursors into Rag2/yc `` - recipients .
PU.1 is essential for myeloid differentiation , '' yet its absence causes divergent consequences in distinct cell subsets .
Monocytes and macrophages strictly depend on PU.1 for develop-ment , '' whereas neutrophils can develop in PU.1~ '' ~ mice , although they show defective effector functions . '' ''
Myeloid-derived dendritic cells also fail to develop in the absence of PU.1 , whereas the requirement for PU.1 in development of lymphoid-derived dendritic cells is controversial , and the expression of PU.1 in this subset has not been documented .
`` % '' PU.1 expression is maintained as CLPs differentiate toward the B-cell lineage but is turned off early in T-cell development. '' ? ''
The requirement of PU.1 for B-cell development appears absolute , as shown by the complete absence of fetal and BM-derived B lineage cells in PU.1~ '' ~- mice , '* '' which we confirm in this report .
PU.1 regulates the expression of the IL-7Ra gene during fetal PU .
1~ '' ~- fetal hematopoietic progenitors do not express transcripts for the B lineage-specific transcription factors EBF and Pax-5 .
'+ '' Thus , the profound block to B-cell development caused by the PU . ]
mutation may be due to defects in both IL-7-induced proliferation as well as EBF and Pax-5-mediated differentiation of B lineage progenitors .
PU.1 may directly regulate the expression of the immunoglobulin loci.4'* Interestingly , low levels of PU.1 are essential for B-cell development , whereas high levels inhibit B-cell differentiation and instead promote macrophage development . ''
In contrast , PU.1 expression is restricted to a discrete stage of T lineage differentiation .
Only the earliest intrathymic progenitors ( CD44*CD25~ ) express PU.1 , which is rapidly extinguished as T cells mature .
`` > '' '' Still , T-cell development is profoundly impaired in PU.1~ '' ~ mice . ''
However , studies using fetal thymic organ culture have shown that the few thymocytes in PU.1~ '' ~ mice that can bypass this developmental block develop into mature T cells that have normal function , '' thus PU.1 expression in T-cell differentiation is essential only during early thymopoiesis .
CD44*CD25~ cells of fetal thymi contain a bipotent precursor endowed with both NK and T potential , * '' and PU.1 deficiency may block development of these 2 closely related cell lineages .
However , this bipotent precursor may not represent the main pool of NK progenitors in adult life , when NK lymphopoiesis occurs in the BM .
We show here a reduction of NKP in PU.1~ '' ~ BM , whereas their frequency of HSCs was normal .
This suggests a NK lineage-specific role for PU.1 , which may be independent of its role in early T-cell development .
The mechanisms by which the absence of PU.1 disrupts hematopoietic development are being clarified .

BLOOD , 1 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 9 PU.1 is to control the transcription of growth factor receptor genes in developing blood cells. ! ''
In the context of myeloid development , evidence supports a model in which PU.1 is required for expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , macrophage colony-stimulating factor , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and c-fms receptors on early myeloid progenitors ( see Held et al '' and references therein ) .
However , retroviral infection with c-fms could only restore the proliferation but not differentiation defect in PU.1-deficient myeloid precursors , suggesting additional roles for PU.1 in macrophage development . '' ''
Thus , the absence of expression of certain cytokine receptors during early myeloid and B-cell development in PU.1 mutants can partly explain the developmental blocks .
In line with this , PU.1 deficiency impaired the expression of some cytokine and growth factor receptors on developing NK cells .
Previous studies have identified 4 ligand/receptor systems that play an important role in the generation of NK cells from hematopoietic precursors : Flk2/FIt3 , c-kit , IL-7 , and IL-15 ( reviewed in Williams et al '' '' ) .
Of these , we found that PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells express IL-2RB and transcripts for IL-15Ra « and yc .
In contrast , IL-7Ra was absent , and c-kit expression was reduced on PU.1~ '' - NK cells .
The reduction in numbers of NK precursors seen in PU.1~ '' - BM may well reflect a synergistic effect of the defective IL-7Ra « and c-kit expression .
In the absence of c-kit and IL-7R signaling , NK cell development may be sustained by FIk2L/FIt3L , IL-15 , or other cytokines .
A similar cumulative defect in these cytokine receptors may also explain the severe block in early T lymphopoiesis in PU.1- '' ~- mice . ''
Thus , the requirement for IL-7 and c-kit in early NK lymphopoiesis may be less strict than for early thymopoiesis .
Mice deficient in both IL-7 and c-kit will help to test this hypothesis .
T-cell progenitors lose the expression of PU.1 as they commit to the T lineage ( CD44*CD25* ) , whereas NK cells express it throughout development .
In line with this , mature PU.1~ '' - NK cells are less in cycle , fail to proliferate in response to mitogens , and do not express a normal pattern of surface antigens ( including Ly49A , Ly49D , and B220 ) as they differentiate .
Yet they are competent for natural cytolysis of lymphomas , suggesting that PU.1-independent transcriptional regulation governs this crucial NK cell effector function .
Expression of Ly49 molecules may be acquired in an ordered sequence , although expression patterns of genes within the NK cell appear to be regulated independently . ''
However , the mechanisms that control this process remain ill defined .
We found that PU.1 deficiency was associated with a selective reduction in the expression of Ly49A and Ly49D , whereas NK1.1 , Ly49G2 , and Ly49C/I were normally expressed in PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells .
The significance of this observation awaits further investigation but indicates that PU.1 is involved in the fine-tuning of Ly49 expression .
One possibility is that PU.1 may affect the acquisition of early ( Ly49A ) but not late Ly49 ( Ly49C/I ) members .
The TCF-1 transcription factor has also been implicated in the specific regulation of Ly49A . '' ''
However , we References NK CELLS IN PU.1~- MICE _ 2631 could exclude , on the basis of gene expression analysis , a direct effect of PU.1 on TCE-1 expression , and it is , therefore , likely that the defective Ly49 expression seen in PU.I~~ NK cells is independent of TCF-1 , although TCF-1 and PU.1 may cooperate to activate Ly49A expression .
The Ets family of transcription factors comprises multiple members , and , although their expression is regulated in a dynamic way during development , overlapping expression patterns of distinct members is documented and may allow functional redundancy . ''
Another Ets family member expressed in developing lymphoid cells is Ets-1 .
Ets-l1-deficient mice demonstrate T-cell survival defects , accelerated terminal differentiation of B cells , '' '' and reduced numbers of NK cells . ''
We found that PU.1~ '' ~ NK cells express higher levels of Ets-1 transcripts , and it is tempting to speculate that , in the absence of PU.1 , Ets-1 may compensate to some extent for the transcriptional regulation that leads to NK cell development but not to B- and T-cell development .
However , a functional redundancy between PU.1 and Ets-1 is difficult to imagine , as these 2 members share only 40 % homology in their DNA-binding domain and have a different panel of target genes . ''
Alternatively , they may regulate nonoverlapping functions during NK differentiation .
For example , both mice and PU.1~ '' - chimeras have reduced numbers of NK cells , but natural cytotoxicity is abolished in the absence of Ets-1 and is preserved in the absence of PU.1 .
Therefore , PU.1 deficiency is compatible with a normal differentiation of the lytic machinery , including expression of known targets of Ets factors such as LFA-1 and perforin , ' '' whereas Ets-1 may be essential for these genes .
One may argue that the NK cells accumulating in the periphery of PU.1~ '' ~- chimeras may have undergone critical alterations due to effects of the mutation at early developmental stages .
As such , the role of PU.1 in mature NK cells can not be unambiguously assessed .
Conditional gene targeting may provide a solution to this problem , although no NK-cell lineage-specific transgenes have been characterized to date .
Alternatively , retroviral-mediated transfer of PU.1* '' into mature PU.1~ '' - NK cells may allow for correction of their phenotypic and functional abnormalities .
Such technologic improvements should allow for a finer definition of the role of PU.1 in NK cell biology .
Our results suggest that there is a less restrictive requirement for PU.1 in NK cell generation , as compared to myeloid , B cells , and T cells .
Nevertheless , PU.1 plays critical roles in NK cell development , during expansion of committed NK precursors , and in the homeostasis and differentiation of mature NK cells .
