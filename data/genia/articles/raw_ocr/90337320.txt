Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press A novel B-cell lineage-specific transcription factor present at early but not late stages of differentiation Alcide Barberis , Katharina Widenhorn , Luigi Vitelli , * and Meinrad Busslinger® Institute of Molecular Pathology , Dr. Bohr-Gasse 7 , A-1030 Vienna , Austria A novel B-cell-specific transcription factor , BSAP , was identified as a mammalian homolog of the sea urchin protein TSAP , which interacts with the promoters of four tissue-specific late histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes .
As shown by mobility-shift , methylation interference , and mutational analyses , the mammalian protein BSAP recognizes all four sea urchin binding sites in a manner indistinguishable from TSAP ; however , the two proteins differ in molecular weight .
BSAP is exclusively restricted to the B-cell lineage of lymphoid differentiation .
Its expression appears to be activated during pro-B-cell development , is abundant at the pre-B-and mature B-cell stages , but is absent in terminally differentiated plasma cells .
Moreover , BSAP is clearly a B-cell-specific transcription factor , as a wild-type but not a mutant TSAP-binding site of the sea urchin functions only in transfected B cells as an upstream promoter element .
Competition experiments did not reveal any high-affinity binding site for BSAP in known regulatory regions of immunoglobulin and class II major histocompatibility ( MHC ) genes , suggesting that BSAP is a regulator of a different set of B-lymphoid-specific genes .

The pathway by which the hematopoietic stem cell differentiates into B lymphocytes can be divided into several stages that are defined by the state of rearrangement and expression of the immunoglobulin gene family , the presence of cell-surface markers , and the cell 's susceptibility to growth and differentiation factors .
The pro-B lymphocyte , an early progenitor cell committed to B-cell differentiation , still contains both the immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes in germ line configuration but already expresses certain B-lymphoid-specific surface proteins ( Katamine et al .
1984 ; McKearn et al .
1985 ; Palacios and Steinmetz 1985 ; Muller-Sieburg et al .
1986 ; Palacios et al .
1987 ; Davidson et al .

Differentiation of pro-B cells to pre-B cells is accompanied by functional rearrangement of the p heavy-chain gene .
As a consequence , pre-B cells express cytoplasmic j protein but fail to synthesize light chains of the k and A type required for assembly of complete surface IgM mole-cules .
Pre-B cells differentiate into mature B cells expressing immunoglobulin proteins on their surface by productively rearranging either the x or A light-chain gene locus .
B cells are able to undergo isotype switching and , upon stimulation by appropriate signals , give rise to mature plasma cells that secrete large amounts of im- Present addresses : 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Harvard University , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02138 USA ; `` Istituto Superiore di Sanita , Laboratorio di Biologia Cellulare , 00161 Rome , Italy .

Much of the insight into B-cell development has been gained by the analysis of transformed cell lines and tumors , which are arrested at various stages of B-lymphocyte differentiation and essentially retain their lineage specificity faithfully ( Greaves et al .
1986 ; Hanley-Hyde and Lynch 1986 ) .
Tissue-specific gene expression is primarily controlled at the level of transcription initiation .
The B-cell-specific regulation of two gene families coding for immunoglobulin and class HI major histocompatibility ( MHC ) proteins has been studied in detail .
These analyses revealed that both the promoter and an enhancer region contribute to the B-cell-specific transcription of immunoglobulin and class II MHC genes { for reviews , see Blackwell and Alt 1989 ; Fehling et al .
1989 ) .
These regulatory regions contain multiple sequence elements that interact with ubiquitous , as well as B-cell-specific , transcription factors ( Dorn et al .
1988 ; Sen and Baltimore 1989 } .
The critical regulatory sequences and factors differ , however , between the two gene families ( Koch et al .
1989 ) .
A common theme is nevertheless emerging , in that the interplay of ubiquitous and B-cell-restricted transcription factors is responsible for mediating B-lymphoid-specific expression .
Five different B-cell-specific transcription factors have been identified to date .

1988 ; Scheidereit et al .
1988 ) , and in some , but not all , promoters of class II MHC genes ( Sherman et al .
1989 ) .
Another less well-characterized B-cell-specific activity binds to an element , HE2 , in the human IgH enhancer ( Maeda et al .
1987 ; Araki et al .
1988 ) .
The inducible transcription factor NF-kB is only constitutively active in B cells and plasma cells and interacts with the Igx enhancer ( Sen and Baltimore 19862 , b ) and with the upstream region of certain class II MHC genes [ Dorm et al .
1988 ; Blanar et al .
1989 ) .
The protein NF-W1 binds to an important enhancer element of the class II MHC gene Ea ( Dorm et al .
1989 } , whereas yet another B-cell-specific protein appears to interact with the upstream region of the Aa gene ( Boothby et al .
1988 ) .
We have previously characterized a tissue-specific activator protein [ TSAP ) of the sea urchin , which is , at least in part , responsible for the developmental and tissue-specific regulation of two nonallelic pairs of late histone H2ZA-2 and H2B-2 genes ( Barberis et al .
1989 ) .
The four TSAP-binding sites of these genes are shown together with their deduced consensus sequence in Figure 1 .
We have now identified a novel B-cell lineage-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) that recognizes all four binding sites in a manner indistinguishable from the sea urchin protein .
This mammalian homolog of TSAP is present at equal concentrations in murine and human pro-B , pre-B , and mature B cells but is undetectable in terminally differentiated plasma cells .
Competition experiments indicate further that BSAP may not be involved in the transcriptional control of immunoglobulin and class II MHC genes and thus suggest a role for it in the regulation of a different family of B-lymphoid-specific genes .

850 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Results The human B-cell line BJA-B contains a DNA-binding activity homologous to the sea urchin TSAP Using the electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( Fried and Crothers 1981 ; Garner and Rezvin 1981 ) we have screened nuclear extracts of different murine and human cell lines for a DNA-binding activity homologous to the tissue-specific transcription factor TSAP of the sea urchin ( Barberis et al .
1989 ] .
The only cell line that scored positive in this initial screen was the human B-cell line BJA-B .
Figure 2A shows a comparison of the BJA-B extract with a nuclear extract of sea urchin gastrula embryos .
Short end-labeled DNA fragments containing one of the four TSAP-binding sites of the late histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes ( see Fig .
1 ) were incubated in both nuclear extracts , and specific protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel .
All four binding sites gave rise to a protein-DNA complex of similar electrophoretic mobility and intensity in the BJA-B extract .
For reasons discussed below , we refer to this DNA-binding activity as BSAP .
The BSAP complex migrates faster than the two TSAP complexes B1 and B2 , suggesting that the human and sea urchin proteins differ from each other in molecular size [ see below ) .
The relative affinity of BSAP for all four sea urchin-binding sites was analyzed in cross-competition experiments ( Fig .
2B ) .
The BSAP complex generated with each of the four sea urchin-binding sites is competed away at identical concentrations of unlabeled competitor DNA containing the -binding site of the H2B-2.2 gene .
This complex is clearly specific , as unrelated pUC18 plasmid DNA starts to compete only at high DNA concentra-tions .
Therefore , BSAP appears to recognize all four binding sites with equal affinity , as does the sea urchin TSAP ( Barberis et al .
1989 ] .
The sequence recognition of BSAP was compared with that of the sea urchin TSAP by methylation interference analysis ( Siebenlist et al .
1980 } .
An end-labeled DNA fragment containing the TSAP-binding site of the H2B-2.1 gene was partially methylated at G and A residues and used in mobility-shift experiments with sea urchin gastrula or human BJA-B nuclear extracts .
Free and bound DNA was eluted from the gel , cleaved at modified purines , and analyzed on a denaturing sequencing gel .
Methylated G and A residues that interfere with protein binding are expected to be under-repre-sented in the bound , relative to the free , DNA fraction .
As shown in Figure 3 , the same methylated G and A residues in both DNA strands interfere with binding of the sea urchin TSAP and human BSAP .
We therefore conclude that both proteins interact with DNA in a very similar manner .
This conclusion is further supported by the mutational analysis shown in Figure 4 .
All four TSAP recognition sequences share only one strictly invariant nucleotide position , C , with one another , as is shown in Figure 1 .
This C residue was mutated to an A in the binding sites of the H2B-2.1 and H2A-2.2 genes { see Fig .
1 } .

By these criteria , BSAP appears to be the mammalian homolog of the sea urchin TSAP .
The mammalian BSAP and the sea urchin TSAP differ in molecular weight Although the mammalian BSAP and the sea urchin TSAP interact with DNA in a similar manner , both proteins differ in their electrophoretic mobility in native polyacrylamide gels ( Fig .

this difference , we have determined the molecular weight of the two proteins by the indirect method of UV cross-linking ( Ogata and Gilbert 1977 ) .
A uniformly labeled and 5-bromo-deoxyuridine-substituted DNA probe of the H2A-2.2 TSAP-binding site was used in mobility-shift experiments with nuclear extracts of either sea urchin gastrula embryos or human BJA-B cells ( see Materials and methods ) .
After electrophoretic separation of the protein-DNA complexes , the radioactive DNA was cross-linked to the protein in situ in the gel followed by DNase I digestion .
Labeled protein was then eluted and analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE .
As shown in Figure 5A , this procedure detected a polypeptide of 50 kD in the BJA-B extract [ lane 2 ) and two different polypeptides of 85 kD ( complex B1 , lane 3 ) and 76 kD { complex B2 , lane 4 ) in the sea urchin gastrula extract .
These labeled proteins correspond to BSAP and TSAP , as the same C - A mutation that strongly reduces DNA binding of both proteins ( Figs .
1 and 4 ) also prevents protein labeling by UV cross-linking ( Fig .
5A , lanes 1 and 5 ) .
These findings clearly demonstrate that BSAP and TSAP differ from each other in molecular weight .
The above experiment did not rule out the possibility that BSAP ( and TSAP ) is a heteromeric complex containing additional polypeptides of different molecular weights that are required for DNA-binding activity .
To address this question , we fractionated the BJA-B extract by preparative SDS-PAGE ( Laemmli et al .
1970 } , cut the gel into slices , and eluted the protein .
Eluted material was denatured , renatured , and analyzed for binding activity by mobility-shift assay ( Fig .
5B ) .
Intact BSAP activity was recovered in gel slice 3 , which contains proteins in the range of 50 kD .
This evidence suggests strongly that BSAP consists of only one polypeptide of 50 kD .
BSAP is present at early , but not late , stages of B-cell differentiation We then studied the cell-type specificity of BSAP .
Nu clear extracts were prepared from lymphoid , myeloid , and nonhematopoietic cell lines of human and murine origin .
The integrity of each nuclear extract was tested first by analysis of the pattern of octamer-binding proteins in electrophoretic mobility-shift experiments { data not shown ) .
The nuclear extracts were then screened for the presence of BSAP .
The result of this survey is summarized in Table 1 , and representative mobility-shift experiments are shown in Figure 6 .
BSAP was found exclusively in B-lymphoid cells .
No BSAP activity could be detected , even after long autoradiographic exposure , in seven T-lymphoid , five myeloid , three erythroid , and five nonhematopoietic cell lines .
The strict B-cell specificity of BSAP was further corroborated by analyzing nuclear extracts of different rat tissues [ Fig .
6 ) .
The spleen was shown to contain about the same amount of BSAP protein as the various B-lymphoid cell lines .
This is in agreement with the fact that ~50 % of the nucleated spleen cells are B lymphocytes ( Patrick et al .
1986 ) .
However , BSAP activity was not detectable in nuclear extracts from thymus , liver , and brain .
The thymus is the central lymphoid organ for T-cell development and consists > 95 % of T cells ( Patrick et al .
1986 ) .
The absence of BSAP in thymus therefore strongly argues that this protein is restricted to the B-cell lineage of lymphoid differentiation .
The temporal regulation of BSAP expression during B-cell development was investigated by analysis of a series of transformed cell lines that are arrested at different stages of B-cell differentiation { see introductory section ; Table 1 , Fig .
6 ) .
BSAP is clearly absent in the earliest progenitor B-cell line tested , LyD9 [ Palacios et al .
1987 ) .
However , BSAP is already abundantly expressed in pro-B cells that have progressed further along the B-cell differentiation pathway , that is , in the murine cell line HAFTL-1scl ( Davidson et al .
1988 ) and in the human cell line FLEB 14 ( Katamine et al .
1984 ) .
This suggests that the expression of BSAP is initiated during pro-B-cell development .
Interestingly , BSAP is present at similar Figure 5 .
Molecular weight determination of BSAP and TSAP .
( A ) UV cross-linking .
Nuclear extracts of BJA-B cells ( lane 1 and 2 ) and sea urchin gastrula embryos [ lane 3-5 ) were incubated with a uniformly labeled and 5-bromodeoxyuridine substituted DNA probe containing the TSAP-binding site of the H2A-2.2 gene .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4 % native polyacrylamide gel , UV-irradiated in the gel , digested with DNase I , eluted from acrylamide , and analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE [ Laemmli 1970 } , as described in Materials and methods .
The wild-type TSAP recognition sequence was used for labeling of BSAP in lane 2 and for detection of the polypeptides of the TSAP complexes Bl and B2 in lanes 3 and 4 , respectively .
A mutant TSAP probe containing the C- A mutation that drastically reduces protein binding ( Figs .
1 and 4 ) also prevents transfer of label to BSAP ( lane 1 } and to the upper TSAP band Bl { lane 5 } .
'*C-labeled proteins ( Amersham , Inc. ) were used as molecular weight markers in lane M. ( B ) Mobility-shift analysis of gel-purified and renatured BSAP activity .
Nuclear proteins of the BJA-B extract were fractionated by 12 % SDS-PAGE , .
The region of 70-30 kD was divided into seven gel slices .
Proteins were eluted , denatured , renatured , and subjected to mobility-shift analysis with the labeled H2B-2.1 TSAP probe .
Unfractionated BJA-B extract was used in lane B .
Only the section of the autoradiograph containing the BSAP complex is shown .
The minor DNA-binding activity of faster electrophoretic mobility , which is present in fraction 4 , appears to be a proteolytic degradation product of BSAP that is also present at low abundance in the unfractionated extract .

Representative results of these experiments are shown in Fig .

The nonhematopoietic cell lines are of the following origin : ( NIH-3T3 and 208F ) rodent fibroblasts ; ( HeLa ) human cervix carcinoma ; ( PC12 ) rat pheo-chromocytoma , ; ( F9 ) mouse embryocarcinoma .
concentration not only in the two pro-B cells HAFTL-1 and FLEB 14 but also in all six pre-B and mature B-cell lines tested .
However , BSAP activity was not detected in five plasmacytoma cell lines that represent the equivalent of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells .
From this we conclude that BSAP expression is turned off at the time of terminal differentiation to plasma cells .
Hence , BSAP is present at early , but not late , stages of B-cell differentiation .
It is worth noting that the temporal expression pattern of BSAP is apparently identical in human and murine B lymphocytes ( Fig .
6 ; Table 1 ) .
Surprisingly , the BSAP protein did not exhibit any lineage infidelity at all in our analysis , which was further B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP supported by the following observation .
The pro-B cell HAFTL-1 can be differentiated , upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) , within either the myelomonocytic or B-cell lineages ( Davidson et al .
1988 ) .
The derived pre-B-cell line HAFTL-pBcl.6 still expresses the same amount of BSAP protein as the parental pro-B-cell line HAFTL-1 ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , BSAP expression is lost in the derived macrophage cell line HAFTL-M1g4 , suggesting that BSAP may be incompatible with myelomonocytic differentiation .
BSAP does not bind to known regulatory regions of immunoglobulin and class II MHC genes So far , we have used TSAP-binding sites of sea urchin histone genes to identify a mammalian DNA-binding factor that is exclusively expressed during B-cell differentiation .
The question therefore arises whether BSAP is indeed a novel DNA-binding activity and/or whether it interacts with known regulatory regions of B-cell-specific genes .
We have first analyzed the promoter and enhancer regions of immunoglobulin genes for potential BSAP-binding sites .
As shown in Figure 7A , DNA fragments of an immunoglobulin V ; , gene promoter , of the IgH enhancer , of the intronic Igx enhancer , and of the downstream x 3 ' enhancer all competed inefficiently and only at high molar ratios for BSAP complex forma-tion , in contrast to the homologous TSAP recognition sequence .
We regard this competition as unspecific , particularly because the bacterial plasmid pUC18 competed in the same range of DNA concentrations ( data not shown ) .
This unspecific competition appears to be caused by the length and complexity of the four DNA fragments , as a short oligonucleotide containing only the NF- « B-binding site did not compete , not even at the highest molar ratio .
This discrepancy is best explained by the fact that the consensus recognition sequence for both TSAP and BSAP is degenerate ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
Other short oligonucleotides containing the recognition sequences for additional transcription factors known to bind to the immunoglobulin enhancer and promoter regions { see introductory section ) also failed to compete for BSAP binding ( Fig .
7B ) .
We therefore conclude that neither the enhancers of the IgH and Igx genes nor one of the many immunoglobulin V ; , gene promoters contain a high-affinity binding site for BSAP .
Class II MHC genes are expressed at a constitutively high level in mature B cells .
The B-cell-specific regulation of the murine Ea gene depends on three motifs , referred to as X , Y , and W elements ( Koch et al , 1989 ) , whereas the upstream region of the Aa gene contains two novel regulatory elements ( BRE1 and BRE ) that are recognized by the same B-cell-specific protein ( Boothby et al .
1988 ) .
As shown in Figure 7C , none of these regulatory sequences competed for BSAP binding .
A purine-rich sequence was shown previously to play an important role in the expression of SV40 and lymphotropic papovavirus ( LPV ) in B cells ( Pettersson and Schaffner 1987 ) .
This Pu motif also did not compete for BSAP binding and , hence , interacts with a lymphoid-specific protein other than BSAP ( Fig .
7B ) .

B-cell lineage specificity of BSAP .
The same amount of nuclear protein isolated from the cell lines and rat tissues indicated was analyzed by mobility-shift assay with the TSAP probe of the H2B-2.1 gene .
Most cell lines are described in the text , in Table 1 , or in Materials and methods .
All of these competition experiments failed to reveal any high-affinity binding site for BSAP in known regulatory regions of immunoglobulin and class II MHC genes .
We therefore conclude that BSAP is a novel B-cell-specific DNA-binding protein that may be involved in the regulation of other B-lymphoid-specific genes .
BSAP is a B-cell-specific transcription factor We then tested whether BSAP can act as a B-cell-specific transcription factor .
As no potential target gene for BSAP has yet been identified , we pursued the following strategy .
The TSAP-binding site of the sea urchin H2A-2.2 gene was cloned in both orientations upstream of the TATA box of the rabbit B-globin gene into the OVEC-S vector [ Fig .
8C ; Westin et al .
1987 ) .
These plasmids were transiently transfected into BJA-B cells , together with a reference gene that was linked at its TATA box to the SV40 enhancer and contained a deletion in the B-globin leader sequence { OVEC-Ref ; Fig .
8C ) .
B-Globin gene expression of both the test and reference genes was measured by RNase protection analysis , and the result is shown in Figure 8A .
The wild-type TSAP-binding site efficiently stimulated correct transcription initiation of the B-globin gene of plasmid OVEC-B as compared to the parental construct OVEC-S .
Therefore , the TSAP recognition sequence was fully active as an upstream regulatory element in both orientations in BJA-B cells .
This increase in transcription was not observed with the mutant TSAP-binding site containing the C- A point mutation that prevents BSAP binding ( Figs .
1 and 4 ) .
This evidence clearly ruled out the possibility that the observed transcriptional stimulation was caused by another , fortuitously created pro-tein-binding site in the OVEC-B plasmids .
We therefore conclude that BSAP is a transcription factor .
This contention was further corroborated by the experiment of Figure 8B , where we compared B-globin gene expression of the OVEC-B and OVEC-S plasmids in several additional cell lines .
The presence of the TSAP-binding site clearly stimulated transcription in another human B-cell line , Namalwa .
However , no transcriptional increase was observed in cell lines lacking BSAP-binding activity , that is , in the plasma cell line P3X63-Ag8.653 , in the 854 GENES & DEVELOPMENT CS '\\ ’ ’ \ A ( L C ) FEA ¢ 46 ” $ 0 ix go e8¢ ad s t Q ) Q x6 Q® « & 6° ” 9+ ¢ « M4 « fag §§ , C DIII | ass - - > e088 T-cell line EL4 , in Hela cells , and in NIH-3T3 fibro-blasts .
Hence , these functional data , taken together with the biochemical results of Figures 6 and 7 , clearly demonstrate that BSAP deserves its name as B-cell-specific activator protein because it is a novel transcription factor that is exclusively expressed during B-cell differentiation .
Discussion BSAP is a mammalian homolog of the sea urchin transcription factor TSAP The novel B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP appears to be a mammalian homolog of the sea urchin TSAP ( Barberis et al .
1989 ) by the following criteria .
First , the mammalian BSAP binds to all four TSAP-binding sites of the sea urchin histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes and recognizes them with equal affinity , as does the sea urchin protein .
These four binding sites differ considerably in primary sequence ( Barberis et al .
1989 } ; consequently , BSAP appears to exhibit the same seemingly degenerate mode of sequence recognition as TSAP .
Second , BSAP and TSAP interact with DNA in a similar manner , as they contact the same bases within their recognition sequence in methylation interference experiments .
Third , a single C- A mutation at the only strictly invariant position within the TSAP-binding sites prevents binding of both proteins to the same degree .
This mutational analysis further confirms our previous sequence alignment of the four TSAP-binding sites [ Fig .
1 ; Barberis et al .
1989 ) .
Taken together , all of this evidence indicates that the sea urchin TSAP and the mammalian BSAP share a highly conserved DNA-binding do-main .
However , the two proteins differ markedly in their molecular weight , as determined by UV cross-linking .
The apparent sizes of the two TSAP polypeptides in sea urchin embryos are 85 kD ( B1 ) and 76 kD ( B2 ) , whereas the human BSAP has an apparent molecular mass of 50 kD .
This size difference suggests that the sea urchin and mammalian proteins vary considerably outside of their conserved DNA-binding region , possibly reflecting the presence of additional domains of distinct function .

( l ) Competition analysis with immunoglobulin promoter and enhancer DNA fragments .
Increasing quantities of the indicated DNA fragments were used for competition with the same amount of labeled H2B-2.1 TSAP probe in mobility-shift experiments with the BJA-B extract .
BSAP binding was quantitated by densito-metric scanning of the autoradiographs .
The immunoglobulin V ; , promoter fragment contained the DNA sequences from position -285 ( HindII ) to +130 ( Ball ) , relative to the transcription start site of the murine 70Z VH * gene [ Nelson et al .
1983 ) .
The IgH enhancer DNA corresponded to a Hinf !
fragment extending from nucleotide 345 to 566 of the murine IgH enhancer ( for numbering , see Gerster et al .
1987 ) .
A 480-bp Alul fragment of the Igx gene was used as intronic Igx enhancer DNA ( Picard and Schaffner 1984 ) .
An 810-bp Sacl-Xbal fragment located 9 kb downstream of the Igx gene was used as x3 ' enhancer competitor ( Meyer and Neuberger 1989 ) { B ) Competition with recognition sequences of transcription factors that bind to regulatory regions of immunoglobulin genes .
( C ) Competition with regulatory sequences of class I MHC genes .
In both cases , a 700-fold excess of the indicated double-stranded oligonucleotides was used as competitor DNA in mobility-shift experiments with BJA-B extracts .
Only the relevant part of the autora-diographs containing the BSAP complex is shown .
For description of oligonucleotides , see text and Materials and methods .
B-cell specificity of BSAP The mammalian BSAP and the sea urchin TSAP share an additional feature .
Both factors are present in a strictly tissue-specific manner in the adult organism .
Whereas TSAP expression is restricted to the tube foot of the sea urchin ( Barberis et al .
1989 ) , BSAP appears to be expressed exclusively during mammalian B-cell differentiation .
The B-cell specificity of BSAP is high B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP lighted by the complete absence of BSAP in all T-lymphoid , myelomonocytic , erythroid , and nonhematopoietic cell lines tested .
Moreover , BSAP activity was not observed in liver , brain , or thymus , but it was abundant in nuclear extract from spleen , which consists of up to 50 % of B lymphocytes ( [ Patrick et al .
1986 ) .
The expression of BSAP is temporally regulated during B-cell ontogeny .
It appears to be initiated during pro-B-cell differentiation on the basis of the absence of BSAP activity in the early progenitor B-cell line LyD2 ( Palacios et al .
1987 } and the presence of BSAP in the cell lines HAFTL-1 [ Davidson et al .
1988 ) and FLEB 14 ( Katamine et al .
1984 ) , which represent later stages of pro-B-cell development .
BSAP is present at approximately the same concentration from the pro-B- to the mature B-cell stage of differentiation .
However , its expression is turned off at the time of terminal differentiation to plasma cells , as demonstrated by the lack of activity in all plasmacytoma cell lines analyzed .
The strict lineage fidelity of BSAP is astonishing , particularly in comparison to the `` B-cell-specific ' Oct-2 protein , which is promiscuously expressed in certain T-lymphoid and myelomonocytic cell lines ( Landolfi et al .
1986 ; Schreiber et al .
1988 ; A. Barberis et al. , unpubl . ) .
This finding argues strongly for an important role of BSAP in establishing and maintaining part of the B-cell phenotype .
In agreement with this hypothesis is the observation that the expression of BSAP segregates entirely with the B-cell phenotype ( Fig .
6 ) , following differentiation of the HAFTL-1 cell line along the B-cell and monocyte/macrophage lineages ( Davidson et al .
1988 ) .
A more practical consequence of this is that BSAP may serve as a useful genetic marker for early stages of B-cell differentiation .
BSAP is a novel transcription factor The sea urchin TSAP was shown previously to be a developmental and tissue-specific transcription factor of a subset of late histone genes ( Barberis et al .
1989 ) .
Cell transfection experiments have now demonstrated that the mammalian homolog BSAP can also act as a cell-type-specific transcription factor , because a minimal promoter consisting of a TATA box and a sea urchin TSAP recognition sequence was active only in B cells but not in cell lines lacking BSAP activity .
A bewildering variety of B-cell-specific transcription factors has been identified so far ( see introductory section ) .
BSAP appears to be yet a new addition to this list , because it differs from all of the other proteins as judged by the failure of cross-competition in DNA-binding assays .
Hence , BSAP is not identical with Oct-2 ( Clerc et al .
1988 ; Muller et al .
1988 ; Scheidereit et al .
1988 ) , NF-KB { Sen and Baltimore 19862 , b ) , NF-W1 ( Dorn et al .
1989 ) , the DNA-binding activities interacting with the human IgH enhancer fragment HE2 ( Araki et al .
1988 } , the upstream elements BRE-1/2 of the mouse class II MHC gene Aa ( Boothby et al .
1988 ) , and the purine-rich motif of the SV40 and LPV enhancer ( Pettersson and Schaffner 1987 ) .
In contrast to BSAF , some of these transcription factors ( Oct-2 , NF- « B , and the HE2-binding protein } were GENES & DEVELOPMENT 855 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Barberis et al .

- BSAP is a B-cell-specific transcription factor .
( A ) Activity of a minimal promoter consisting of a TATA box and the H2A-2.2 TSAP-binding site in BJA-B cells .
The plasmids OVEC-B and OVEC-S were transiently transfected into BJA-B cells , together with OVEC-Ref , and the expression of the B-globin reporter gene was analyzed by SP6 RNA mapping , as described in Materials and methods .
( 5 end ) Correctly initiated transcripts of the B-globin gene present in OVEC-B and OVEC-S ; { reference ) transcripts of the plasmid OVEC-Ref .
( B ) The TSAP-binding site is a B-cell-specific upstream element .
The expression of the B-globin gene of OVEC-B and OVEC-S was analyzed in the B-cell line Namalwa , the plasmacytoma cell line P3X63-Ag8.653 , the T-cell line EL4 , HeLa cells , and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts , as described above .
5'-End-labeled pUC18 DNA digested with MspI was used as marker ( lane M ; sizes given in nucleotides ) .
[ ( C ) Schematic diagram of the OVEC plasmids .
OVEC-S and OVEC-Ref have been described by Westin et al .
( 1987 ) .
The wild-type and mutant H2A-2.2 TSAP oligonucleotides used in the mutational analysis of Fig .
4 were cloned into the Sall site of OVEC-S in both orientations ( indicated by arrows ) to generate the OVEC-B plasmids .
shown to be fully active in plasma cells ( Sen and Baltimore 1986a ; Gerster et al .
1987 ; Araki et al .
1988 ) .
Moreover , competition experiments also failed to reveal any high-affinity binding sites for BSAP in the IgH and Igx enhancers , as well as in an immunoglobulin V ; , gene promoter .
An extensive search of the upstream sequences of the class II MHC gene Ea also did not lead to the identification of a novel B-cell-specific transcription factor other than NF-W1 ( Dorn et al .
1989 ) .
Taken together , all this evidence therefore indicates that BSAP does not interact with known control regions of immunoglobulin and class II MHC genes .
Consequently , BSAP may not be involved in the regulation of these two gene families .
Potential target genes for BSAP The sea urchin TSAP and the mammalian BSAP are both transcription factors with a conserved DNA-binding domain and a strictly tissue-specific expression pattern ; however , the two proteins differ in other aspects .
This is emphasized not only by the difference in molecular weight but also by the fact that TSAP is expressed in the tube foot rather than in the coelomocyte , the primitive immune system of the sea urchin ( Barberis et al .
1989 ) .
Moreover , the late H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes of the sea urchin that are regulated by TSAP are , to our knowledge , the only core histone genes known to be expressed in a 856 GENES & DEVELOPMENT tissue-specific manner in somatic cells of higher eu-karyotes ( Kemler and Busslinger 1986 ) .
It is therefore unlikely that a B-cell-specific equivalent of these genes may exist in the mammalian genome .
All of this evidence led us to conclude that the two transcription factors BSAP and TSAP fulfill different functions in their respective tissues by regulating different sets of genes .
Different stages of mammalian B-cell development are characterized by the expression of specific cell-surface proteins , many of which are involved in signal transduc-tion { Loken et al .
1987 ) .
The genes coding for some of these surface antigens have recently been isolated and characterized .
At least three of these genes ( { mb-1 , Lyb-2 , and CD19 ) are exclusively expressed in pro-B , pre-B , and mature B cells but not in plasma cells ( Nadler et al .
1983 ; Sakaguchi et al .
1988 ; Stamenkovic and Seed 1988 ; Uckun et al .
1988 ; Nakayama et al .
1989 ; Tedder and Isaacs 1989 ) and , hence , show an expression pattern similar to that of BSAP .
It is therefore possible that BSAP may regulate these genes .
The best candidate is the mouse mb-1 gene , which codes for a CD3-like trans-membrane protein [ Sakaguchi et al .
1988 ) .
The expression of this gene was analyzed in many of the cell lines used in our study , and in all cases , there was complete correlation between mb-1 and BSAP expression ( Saka-guchi et al .
1988 ) .
The Lyb-2 gene codes for another mouse B-cell differentiation antigen that appears to play Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press an important role as a receptor for a B-cell growth factor or lymphokine ( Nakayama et al .
1989 ) , whereas the CD19 gene encodes the earliest and most reliable human B-cell lineage surface marker ( Nadler et al .
1983 ; Stamenkovic and Seed 1988 ; Uckun et al .
1988 ; Tedder and Isaacs 1989 ) .
However , the involvement of BSAP in the transcriptional control of these genes will remain speculative as long as the regulatory regions of these genes have not yet been sequenced and characterized .

Preparation of nuclear extracts Hematopoietic cells were grown to 10° cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 1 % penicillin/strep-tomycin ( 1000 IU of each per milliliter ) , 1 % L-glutamine ( 2 mm } , and 50 wm B-mercaptoethanol , and all nonhematopoietic cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium ( DMEM } supplemented with the same ingredients except for B-mercaptocthanol .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al .
( 1983 ) , with minor modifications .
The following protease inhibitors were added to all solutions at the indicated final concentration : 5 pg/ml leupeptin , 5 ug/ml pepstatin A , 5 ug/ral antipain , 5 ug/ml chymostatin , 0.5 mm PMSF , 1 um aprotinin , 1 mM 6-amino capronic acid , and 10 um TRCK ( N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ) .
Most nuclear extracts were immediately frozen away after salt extraction in buffer C [ 0.3 m NaCl , 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 } , 20 % glycerol , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , 1 mm DTT ] , whereas the proteins of the BJA-B extracts were precipitated by ( NH , ) ; , SO , , followed by dialysis for 5 hr against buffer D [ 20 mm HEPES ( [ pH 7.9 ) , 20 % glycerol , 20 mm KCI , 0.2 mm EDTA , 0.2 mm EGTA , 1 mm DTT ] .
Nuclear extracts from sea urchin gastrula embryos and rat tissues were prepared as described by Barberis et al .
( 1987 ) and Lichtsteiner et al .
[ 1987 ] , respectively .
The protein concentration of all extracts was determined by the method of Bradford { 1976 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift and methylation interference analysis For electrophoretic mobility-shift experiments , 1-3 fmoles of end-labeled DNA were incubated with 3-5 pg of nuclear protein and 2 ug of poly [ d { I-C ) ] in 20 pl of a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 } , 100 mm KCl , 4 % Ficoll , 1 mm EDTA , and 1 mM DTT .
After incubation at room temperature for 15 min , protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4 % polyacryl- B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP amide gel in 0.25 x TBE buffer at 10 V/cm for 2-3 hr at room temperature .
Competitor DNA was included into the reaction mixture in the amounts described in the legends to Figs .

Methylation interference analysis was carried out as described by Barberis et al .
( 1989 ) .
Oligonucleotide probes and competitors The cloned oligonucleotides containing the TSAP-binding sites of the sea urchin histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes were described previously by Barberis et al .
( 1989 ] .
These oligonucleotides were excised from the polylinker of the pSP64 vector by Aval and Pst !
digestion and end-labeled with and Klenow DNA polymerase .
The oligonucleotides used in the mutational analysis of Figure 4 contained either the promoter sequence of the H2B-2.1 gene from position -50 to -85 or that of the H2A-2.2 gene from position -79 to -114 { Kemler and Busslinger 1986 ) and were flanked in all cases by Sa/l ends .
These oligonucleotides were end-labeled by [ y-*P|ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase .
The same oligonucleotides were cloned in both orientations into the Sall site of OVEC-S { Westin et al .
1987 ) to generate the OVEC-B plasmids [ Fig .
8 ) .
The following double-stranded oligonucleotides that were used as competitor DNAs in mobility-shift assays have been described previously : the TSAP competitor containing the binding site of the late H2B-2.2 gene by Barberis et al .
( 1989 } ; the octamer oligonucleotide by Barberis et al .
{ 1987 ) ; the Y oligonucleotide containing the CCAAT box of the Ea { MHC II ) gene by Superti-Furga et al .

( 1989 ) ; the BRE-2 oligonucleotide by Boothby et al .
{ 1989 } ; and the E1 , E2 , and E4 oligonucleotides by Elmaleh et al .

1987 ; Araki et al .
1988 ) , and the NF- « B oligonucleotide contained the sequence CCAGAGGGGACTITTTCC-GAGAGGG of the mouse Igx enhancer ( Sen and Baltimore 19862 ) .
UV cross-linking The - oligonucleotide GGGTTGTGACGCAGCGCGTGGGT-GACGACTCCAGAGTCGACA containing the H2A-2.2 TSAP-binding - site was annealed to the primer TGTCGACTCTGGAG prior to synthesis of the complementary strand in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine triphos-phate ( 5-BrdUTP ) and [ a-2P ] dCTP as follows .
Annealed oligonucleotides ( 0.5 pmole } were incubated at 15°C for 2 hr in 10-pl reactions containing 1 unit of Klenow DNA polymerase , 66 mm Tris ( pH 7.5 ) 66 mm MgCl , 10 mm DTT , 50 pCi of [ a-+2P ] dCTP , and 50 wm 5-BrdUTP , dGTP , and dATP .

Following electrophoretic separation , protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked in situ in the gel by 12-min exposure to UV light on a transilluminator { TM 15 emitting at 302 nm ; , UVP , Inc. , San Gabriel , CA ) .
The acrylamide slices containing protein-DNA complexes were treated for 1 hr with DNase I in the presence of 10 mm MgCl , and the same protease inhibitor cocktail described above for extract preparation .
Proteins were eluted from acrylamide in 150 mm NaCl , 20 mm HEPES { pH 7.9 ) , 2 mm EDTA , 5 mm DTT , and 1 % SDS , precipitated with 25 % TCA , and analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE , followed by autoradiography .
