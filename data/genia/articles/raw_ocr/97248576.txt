The Pax-5 Gene Is Alternatively Spliced during B-cell Development* ( Received for publication , October 16 , 1996 , and in revised form , January 15 , 1997 ) Patty Zwollo $ §1 , Hector Arrieta $ , Kaleo Ede } , Karen Molindert # , Stephen Desiderio| , and Roberta Pollock ?
From the { Department of Biology , Occidental College , Los Angeles , California 90041 , the §Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , and the |Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 The transcription factor Pax-5 is expressed during the early stages of B-cell differentiation and influences the expression of several B-cell-specific genes .
In addition to the existing isoform ( Pax-5 , which we have named Pax-5a ) , we have isolated three new isoforms , Pax-5b , Pax-5d , and Pax-5e , from murine spleen and B-lymphoid cell lines using library screenings and polymerase chain reaction amplification .
Isoforms Pax-5b and Pax-5e have spliced out their second exon , resulting in proteins with only a partial DNA-binding domain .
Isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e have deleted the 3'-region , which encodes the transactivating domain , and replaced it with a novel sequence .
The existence of alternative Pax-5 transcripts was confirmed using RNase protection assays .
Further-more , Pax-5a and Pax-5b proteins were detected using Western blot analysis .
Pax-5a was detectable in pro- , pre- , and mature B-cell lines , but not in two plasmacy-tomas ; Pax-5b was shown to be present at low levels in mature B-cell lines and , unexpectedly , in one plasma cell line , but not in pro-B-cell or T-cell lines .
Mobility shift assays showed that in vitro translated Pax-5a and Pax-5d , but not Pax-5b or Pax-5e , could interact with a B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site on the blk promoter .
Using this assay , we also showed that Pax-5d was present in nuclear extracts of some ( but not all ) B-lymphoid lines and interacts with the B-cell-specific activator protein-binding site .
The pattern of differential expression of alternatively spliced Pax-5 isoforms suggests that they may be important regulators of transcription during B-cell maturation .
Development of multicellular organisms involves highly regulated expression of specific transcription factors that direct cells into their proper differentiation pathways through interactions with specific target genes .
Typically , transcription factors are divided into groups on the basis of the structural and functional similarity of their DNA-binding domains , such as the basic leucine zipper , basic helix-loop-helix , zinc finger , and homeobox families .
One small family of transcription factors involved in development is the paired box ( Pax ) gene family , containing at least nine members , Pax-1 through Pax-9 ( 1 , 2 ) .
All members contain a conserved DNA-binding domain encoding the paired box , which consists of a 128-amino acid sequence * This work was supported by a research in undergraduate institutions grant from the National Science Foundation .

10160 at the amino-terminal side of the protein .
Other conserved regions in Pax proteins include an octamer and a homeodomain sequence in the center of the protein and a transactivating domain that spans 100 amino acids in the Ser/Thr/Pro-rich region at the carboxyl-terminal end ( 8 , 4 ) .
Pax genes are grouped into four classes based on structural similarity ( 5 ) .
Class I contains Pax-1 and Pax-9 , which lack a homeodomain .
Two Class II members , Pax-3 and Pax-7 , encode both an octamer and a complete homeodomain .
Class III , which includes Pax-2 , Pax-5 , and Pax-8 , represents the class of Pax genes containing an octamer sequence as well as an incomplete homeodomain .
Finally , Class IV contains Pax-4 and Pax-6 , both of which have a full homeodomain , but no octamer sequence .
Pax-5 is one of the best studied members of the Pax family .
In mice , Pax-5 expression is first detected in developing embryos in the mesencephalon and spinal chord ; the spatial and temporal expression pattern of Pax-5 is distinct from other Pax genes in the developing central nervous system ( 4 ) .
Later , Pax-5 is detected in fetal liver , where it correlates with the onset of B-cell development ( 4 ) .
Within the B-cell lineage , Pax-5 transcripts are found in the early stages of B-cell development , including the pro- , pre- , and mature B-cell stage , but this expression ceases when the B-cell reaches the plasma cell stage ( 4 ) .
To date , the only other adult tissue where Pax-5 expression has been observed is adult mouse testis ( 4 ) .
This expression pattern is in agreement with the Pax-5 null mice phenotype .
Mice lacking Pax-5 through targeted deletion of their second exon show a complete block at the pro-B-cell stage of B-cell differentiation as well as an altered pattern of the posterior midbrain , but appear to undergo normal embryonic development and spermatogenesis ( 6 ) .
The Pax-5 gene encodes the B-cell-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) .
* In vitro experiments using mobility shift assays have shown that several B-cell-specific genes contain BSAP-binding sites , including the CD19 ( 4 , 7 ) , CD20 ( 8 ) , me_B , A5 ( 9 ) , and blk ( 10 ) promoters , as well as IgH chain switch regions ( 11 ) and the Ig 3 ' a « ( 12 ) enhancer .
These results are somewhat in contrast with in vivo data from Pax-5 null mice ( which lack BSAP ) because , although pro-B-cells isolated from these mice no longer express CD19 ( as would be expected ) , bik , V , , , , ; , and A5 genes are still expressed at wild-type levels ( 13 ) .
These latter results could suggest that their regulation is not strictly dependent on BSAP during early B-cell development .
Alternatively , this expression pattern may be caused by redundancy of transcription factors similar to Pax-5 .
The alternative splicing of RNA transcripts encoding transcription factors is likely to play an important role during cell * The abbreviations used are : BSAP , B-cell-specific activator protein ; PCR , polymerase chain reaction .

This mechanism provides the cell with rapid and efficient ways to dictate a variety of functionally related activities from a single gene locus .
Alternative splicing of transcription factors as a means of regulating their behavior has been observed in at least four members of the Pax family , and it is likely that some other members of this family will use this mechanism as well .
Alternative splicing of a conserved 83-nucleotide segment in the 3'-portion of the human PAX-2 gene results in a frameshift mutation ( 14 ) .
Four different isoforms of the human PAX-8 and mouse Pax-8 genes are present in kidney tissue , and resulting proteins contain different C termini , which affects their transactivating properties ( 3 ) .
Two PAX-3 isoforms have been detected in humans through the alternate use of exons 4A and 4B , both of which contain the octapeptide ; each resulting isoform has a distinct tissue distribution ( 15 ) .
The human PAX-6 and murine Pax-6 genes have one alternative isoform , in which a 14-amino acid sequence is inserted in the paired domain , resulting in a profound change in its interaction with DNA ( 16 ) .
Within the pathways of lymphocyte development , alternative splicing has recently been shown to occur in two different genes , Ikaros and Tef-1 .
The Ikaros gene is a lymphocyte-restricted zinc finger gene encoding a DNA-binding protein expressed in early lymphocytes and mature T-cells ( 17 , 18 ) .
At least five distinct Ikaros transcripts that may encode functionally diverse proteins have been detected .
Tef-1 is a high mobility group box-containing transcription factor expressed in T-cells that has at least eight different isoforms , either as a result of alternative use of exons and/or the use of a second reading frame ( 19 ) .
Here we describe the isolation of murine Pax-5 cDNAs by library screenings and by PCR and show that at least four different isoforms of Pax-5 mRNAs are expressed in several B-cell lines as well as in spleen , testis , and thymus tissue .
Using RNase protection assays , Western analysis , and mobility shift assays , we show that at least three of these isoforms are differentially expressed in cells of the B-lymphoid lineage .
This suggests that they may play important roles during B-cell development .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of Multiple Pax-5 cDNAs-Pax-5 cDNAs were initially isolated by PCR amplification using cDNA generated from total RNA , isolated from murine spleen or thymus or the pro-B-cell line 22D6.5 .
First strand cDNA was generated from total RNA using a reverse transcription-PCR kit ( Perkin-Elmer ) .
PCR primers were as follows : PP8 , - 5'-gtgegeggeegcAAATGGATTTAGAGAAAAATTAC-3 ' - ( sense primer ) ; SD664 , 5'-cgacgeggeegcAAATGGATTTAGAGAAAAATTATC-CG ; and S $ D6638 , 5'-cogageggecgecGTGACGGTCATAGGCAGTGGC-3 ' ( antisense primer ) ( upper-case letters correspond to nucleotides -2 to 21 , nucleotides -2 to 24 , and nucleotides 1173 to 1153 of murine Pax-5a ( BSAP ) cDNA sequence , respectively , with nucleotides 1-8 ( underlined ) representing the first translational start site ) .
Primers PP8 and SD663 were designed to have a NofI restriction site with flanking nucleotides at their 5'-ends ( indicated by lower-case letters ) .
PCRs were carried out as follows : one initial 10-min denaturing step at 94 °C in the absence of enzyme , followed by denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C , annealing for 2 min at 57 °C , and extension for 5 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles in the presence of Tag polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer ) under the buffer conditions suggested by the supplier ( at a primer concentration of 3 ng/ul ) .
The resulting PCR products between 0.7 and 1.4 kilobase pairs were separated by low-melting agarose gel electrophoresis and molec-ularly cloned into the Nof ] restriction site of pBluescript .
Additional PCR amplifications were performed as described above on A phage libraries containing spleen or B-cell cDNA from the mature B-cell line A20/2J .
The murine spleen cDNA library ( Lambda ZAP II ; Stratagene ) was made from poly ( A ) RNA from an 8-week-old C57Black/6 female mouse using oligo ( dT ) and random priming ; the B-cell cDNA library ( Lambda uni-ZAP ; Stratagene ) was made from poly ( A ) RNA using random and oligo ( dT ) priming .
For the PCRs , 1 ul ( ~10 '' '' plaque-forming units ) of A phage stock was used per 100-ul PCR 10161 volume , and Pax-5 coding sequence was amplified using primers PP8 and SD663 .
The resulting PCR-amplified products were cloned into pBluescript as described above .
To isolate additional isoforms and to confirm the authenticity of PCR-isolated isoforms , the murine spleen cDNA library ( see above ) was screened .
A total of 10° plaques were plated , transferred to nitrocellulose filters , and probed using a full-length Pax-5a ( BSAP ) sequence .
Phage DNAs were isolated and converted to a pBluescript vector ( Stratagene ) .
Primers and Dideoxy Sequencing-The nucleotide sequences of the resulting clones were determined by the dideoxy chain termination sequencing method ( 20 ) using a Sequenase kit ( U. S. Biochemical Corp. ) and the following primers : PS-1 , 5-CCTTCATCCCTCTTGCG-3 ' ( anti-sense ) ; PS-2 , 5'-CCAGTGCCGACACCAAC-3 ' ( sense ) ; PP13 , CAGTCC-TACCCTATTGTC ( sense ) ; PP14 , GCCACCCTCAGTATTCTTCC ( sense ) ; and PP17 , 5-TTTTCCACCACTTTGGGAG-3 ' ( antisense ) , as well as primers PP8 and SD663 ( see above ) and PP15 ( see below ) .
The positions of these primers on Pax-5a cDNA are indicated in Fig .
1 .
PP15 ( 5'-gacttgeggeegeCTTCCCTGTCTCAGGAAAGG-3 ' ; antisense ; corresponding to nucleotides 755 to 786 of sequence unique to isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e ) was used in combination with PP8 to PCR amplify isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e and for dideoxy sequencing .
Cell Lines-All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal clone ( Hyclone Laboratories ) , 2 mM glutamine , 50 units/ml penicillin , 50 pg/ml streptomycin , and 50 uM B-mercaptoethanol .
RNA Isolation and RNase Protection Assays-Total cellular RNA was isolated by the lithium chloride/urea method ( 21 ) or by the guani-dinium isothiocyanate/cesium method ( 22 ) .
Antisense radiolabeled Pax-5 probes were prepared as described ( 23 , 24 ) .
To analyze the sizes of Pax-5 transcripts at the 5'-end ( detecting the deletion of nucleotides 47-212 ) , the plasmid pBS-20.2 , containing a 184-nucleotide NofI-StyI fragment of Pax-5a cDNA , was linearized using the restriction enzyme NofI and transcribed in vitro with T8 RNA polymerase in the presence of [ a-*P ] CTP , resulting in a 262-nucleotide `` probe 20.2 , '' as shown in Fig .
8 .
After transcription , DNA was removed by digestion with 400 units/ml RNase-free DNase I .
The Pax-5d and Pax-5e isoforms were analyzed using the plasmid pBS-10.1 , containing the complete Pax-5d sequence ( nucleotides 1-607 identical to Pax-5a and nucleotides 608-785 unique to Pax-5d and Pax-5e ) .
pBS-10.1 was linearized using the restriction enzyme BsrFI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase , resulting in an antisense probe of $ 92 nucleotides , covering nucleotides 447-607 of Pax-5a and nucleotides 608-735 of sequence unique to Pax-5d and Pax-5e .
A B-tubulin-specific probe was similarly synthesized from the form of the plasmid pub , which contains a 306-base pair BamHI-Stul cDNA fragment .
Antisense RNA probe design is shown in Fig .
8 .
RNase protection assays were performed as described ( 23 ) with mod-ifications .
For each cell line assayed , the RNA probe ( 5 X 10° cpm ) was annealed to 20 ug of total cellular RNA for 16 h at 55 °C in a reaction volume of 30 ul .
After digestion with RNase A ( 40 ug/ml ) and RNase Tl ( 2 ug/ml ) for 30 min at 15 °C , proteinase K and sodium dodecyl sulfate were added to 150 ug/ml and 1 % , respectively , and the reactions were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37°C .
Products were extracted with phenol/chloroform , precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 10 ug of tRNA , and resuspended in sample buffer containing 80 % form-amide .
Products were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 5 % polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and detected by autoradiogra-phy .
Radioactive RNA size markers were prepared using linearized recombinant pBluescript vectors that were available in the laboratory as templates and T3 and T7 RNA polymerases , resulting in labeled RNA transcripts ranging in size from 50 to 291 nucleotides .
In Vitro Transcription and Translation of Pax-5 Isoforms-The plas-mids ( pBluescript ) containing the various Pax-5 isoforms were transcribed in sense and antisense directions with T8 and T7 RNA poly-merases .
Translation was carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) in the presence or absence of [ °°S ) methionine according to the supplier 's directions .
Products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radiography .
Anti-Pax-5 Antibodies-Anti-Pax-5 antibodies were directed against a synthetic peptide covering residues 234-255 of Pax-5a protein , conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( 25 ) .
New Zealand White rabbits were immunized intradermally with 1 mg of coupled peptide , followed by five booster immunizations ( 250 pug each ) that were administered every other week beginning 21 days after the initial immunization ( horseradish peroxidase ) .
Antiserum ( named OC-1 ) was obtained at 12 weeks , analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and used at a 1:250 dilution in Western blot analysis .

Western Blot Analysis-Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from the pro-B-cell lines HAFTL-1-14.5 and 2.1AJP4 , the pre-B-cell line 703/Z , the mature B-cell lines 2PK3 and A20/2J , the plasmacytoma lines SP2/0 and RPC5.4 , and the T-cell line EL-4 were prepared as described ( 10 ) .
Extracts were separated on 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electro-phoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters ( Schleicher & Schuell ) as described ( 10 ) .
Membranes were first incubated for 2 h in blocking solution ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Inc ) , followed by a 1-h incubation with rabbit anti-Pax-5 antiserum OC-1 in blocking so-lution .
Next , membranes were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody ( 1:20,000 ; Zymed Laboratories , Inc. ) for 1 h , followed by a 20-min incubation in the presence of horseradish peroxidase-conju-gated streptavidin at 0.5 ug/ml ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Inc ) .
Between each incubation , membranes were washed three times for 10 min in 1 X wash solution ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Inc ) .
The blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Inc ) , and bands were visualized on Eastman Kodak XAR-5 film .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays-Binding assays were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in 10-ul reactions containing 60 mM KCl , 12 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 4 mM Tris-Cl , pH 7.9 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 30 ng of bovine serum albumin , 12 % glycerol , 1-5 ug of nuclear extract , 0.1 ng of *°P-labeled DNA probe , and 1-5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) .
The DNA probe F3 was identical to the one used in an earlier study ( 10 ) and spans nucleotides -70 to 136 of the murine blk promoter .
Products were separated by electrophoresis on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in a buffer containing 30 mM Tris-Cl , pH 7.5 , 29.3 mM boric acid , and 0.66 mM EDTA .
Gels were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak XAR-5 film .
RESULTS Isolation of Alternatively Spliced Pax-5 Sequences-The presence of alternatively spliced forms of the Pax-5 gene was initially investigated using PCR amplification .
Pax-5 mRNA from the pro-B-cell line 22D6.5 or from mouse tissue was re-verse-transcribed into cDNA ( Stratagene ) and PCR-amplified ( Fig .
1 ) .
Several amplified DNA fragments ranging from 1.4 to 0.7 kilobase pairs were isolated individually by gel purification and cloned into pBluescript .
Dideoxy sequence analysis of different clones resulted in the identification of two Pax-5 isoforms with sizes of 1.2 and 1.1 kilobase pairs .
These were named Pax-5a and Pax-5b , respectively .
From a total of 17 spleen amplified clones containing Pax-5 sequence , 11 were isoform Pax-5a , and three were Pax-5b .
Of 39 analyzed Pax-5 clones from 22D6.5 cDNA , isoform Pax-5a again was most abundant ( 32 clones ) , whereas four clones were isoform Pax-5b .
Some remaining clones containing Pax-5 sequence were either hybrid or incomplete clones .
In addition , we found a number of identical clones , which we named Pax-5¢ , that were similar to Pax-55b , but had an additional internal deletion at their 3'-ends .
The structure of Pax-5¢ is still under investigation .
The sequence of Pax-5a matches that of the published full-length mouse Pax-5 cDNA ( GenBank '' '' /EMBL Data Bank accession no .
M97013 ; Ref .
4 ) and is 1176 nucleotides long ( 391 amino acids ) .

nucleotides 47-212 , which corresponds to its second exon , as indicated in Fig .
24 .
Both Pax-5a and Pax-5b contain two in-frame translational start sites , one at nucleotide 1 ( proximal ATG codon ) and one at nucleotide 325 ( distal ATG codon ) .
Use of the proximal ATG codon in isoform Pax-5a results in a protein of ~53 kDa .
Pax-5b also contains this proximal ATG codon .
However , use of this start codon creates a termination codon ( in exon 3 ) at nucleotide 245 , 12 codons downstream from the deletion , resulting in a peptide of 27 amino acids ( 3.2 kDa ) .
When the distal ATG codon is used ( for either Pax-5a or Pax-5b ) , which results in an open reading frame of 849 nucleotides , a 41-kDa protein will be expressed .
The paired domain of Pax-5a is encoded by nucleotides 45-428 .
Because of the presence of two ATG codons , one Pax-5a transcript could theoretically give rise to two translated pro-teins , one containing a complete and one containing a partial DNA-binding domain .
In this situation , it is likely that the most upstream ( proximal ) ATG codon will be used most fre-quently .
In contrast , translation of the Pax-56 transcript ( from the downstream ATG codon ) will result in Pax-5 protein with an incomplete DNA-binding domain .
To rule out the possibility of PCR artifacts and to find additional isoforms , two A phage cDNA libraries , one from spleen and one from the mature B-cell line A20/2J , were screened with a full-length Pax-5a probe .
PCR analysis was also used on these libraries to search for additional alternatively spliced forms of Pax-5 .

1 447 607 735 pBS-10.1 1 | |___ ] Pax-5d template From the spleen library , 45 Pax-5-containing clones were analyzed by dideoxy sequencing .
Of these clones , 35 represented isoform Pax-5a , and two clones were Pax-5b .
In addition , two new isoforms were identified , Pax-5d and Pax-5e .
These two isoforms had both replaced the 3'-half of their transcript ( nucleotides 607-1176 of Pax-5a ) by novel sequence ( nucleotides 607-735 of Pax-5d ) .
Seven Pax-5d clones and one Pax-be clone were identified .
The breakpoint at nucleotide 607 corresponds to the boundary between exons 5 and 6 of the Pax-5 gene ( 26 ) .
Thus , both isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e contain exons 3-5 , but not exons 6-10 .
Pax-be differs from Pax-5d because it has deleted its second exon ( nucleotides 47-212 ) , which identical to the deletion present in isoform Pax-56 .
The structures of these two new isoforms are indicated in Fig .
24 .
The new sequence shared by Pax-5d and Pax-5e is given in Fig .
2 ( B and C ) .
Comparison of this sequence with the peptide data bases did not reveal any obvious homology to existing sequences , and therefore , its function remains to be determined .
To investigate the possibility that this new sequence contains a transactivating domain , the percentage of Ser/Thr/ Pro residues was determined .
The transactivating domain of the Pax-5a protein ( residues 283-382 ) contains 38 % of these three residues ( 10 ) , as compared with an average occurrence of ~19 % in mammals .
The novel sequence in Pax-5d and Pax-5e had 26 % Ser/Thr/Pro residues , which is considerable lower than the transactivating domain of Pax-5a .
This makes it less likely that the novel Pax-5d sequence encodes a transactivating domain .

1 ) resulted in the detection of isoforms Pax-5a and Pax-5b .
When a different primer set was used in these experiments ( PP8 and PP15 ) , isoforms Pox-5d and Pax-5e were detected .
( The Pax-5d- and Pax-Se-specific primer PP15 anneals immediately downstream from their stop codon . )
PCR amplification ( using either primer set PP8 and SD663 or primer set PP8 and PP15 ) and library screening of the A20/2J library ( using a full-length Pax-5a probe ) did not yield any additional isoforms , although all four isoforms , Pax-ba , Pax-5b , Pax-5d , and Pax-be , were isolated from this library .
It should be noted that for some of the PCR experiments , we used primer PP9 ( nucleotides 1152-1176 ) as the antisense primer in the place of SD663 ( see Fig .
1 ) .
Its sequence was based on the published mouse Pax-5 sequence ( GenBank '' , EMBL Data Bank accession no .
M97013 ; Ref .
4 ) , but this primer did not amplify Pax-5 sequences efficiently .
Later experiments using conventional library screening followed by dideoxy sequencing indicated that all murine Pax-5 sequences isolated by our group contained 4 nucleotides in the area covered by primer PP9 that differed from the published murine Pax-5 sequence : nucleotides 1158 ( C to T ) , 1161 ( C to G ) , 1164 ( T to C ) , and 1170 ( T to C ) ( our results to published sequence ) , all of which are third or `` wobble '' positions of the codons .
This discrepancy explains the inability of PP9 to anneal efficiently to Pax-5 sequence in this region .
The antisense primer SD663 , although based on human PAX-5 sequence , has only one mismatch ( out of 21 nucleotides ) with mouse Pax-5 in this region and resulted in highly efficient PCR amplifications .

RNase protection assays .
A , results using riboprobe 20.2 , which detects the deletion of exon 2 .
The RNAs from nine B-cell lines and one T-cell line as well as four mouse tissues were used .
The 184-nucleotide band ( open arrowhead ) corresponds to Pax-5 isoforms that contain exon 2 .
The 46-nucleotide band ( closed arrowhead ) corresponds to Pax-5 transcripts that have deleted exon 2 .
B , results using riboprobe 10.1 , which detects transcripts containing novel sequence as present in Pax-5d and Pax-5e .
The 288-nucleotide band ( open arrowhead ) corresponds to Pax-5 transcripts that contain both Pax-5 shared sequence as well as Pax-5d/Se-specific sequence ( see Fig .
3 ) .
The 160-nucleotide band ( closed arrowhead ) corresponds to transcripts that share Pax-5 sequence , but not the novel sequence in the region covered by the riboprobe .
C , results from the control riboprobe ( pu ) , which detects -tubulin transcripts .
P.C. , plasmacytoma .
Detection of Heterologous Pax-5 Transcripts in B-cell Lines and Tissues-To obtain additional evidence for the existence of differentially spliced Pax-5 transcripts in B-cell lines as well as to investigate the Pax-5 distribution pattern in mouse tissues , RNase protection assays were used .
The following antisense Pax-5 RNA probes were used to analyze the sizes of Pax-5 transcripts : 1 ) the 5'-probe 20.2 , which detects the 5'-deletion present in Pax-5b and Pax-5e ; 2 ) the internal probe 10.1 , which detects the novel sequences present in isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e ; and 3 ) a `` control '' tubulin probe ( pu ) , which detects overall levels and quality of RNA .
Probe design and the `` expected '' protected RNA fragments are indicated in Fig .
3 .
Because it was important to determine accurately the sizes of the protected fragments , an array of RNA markers were run in parallel , using several recombinant pBluescript vectors as DNA templates .
Using T3 and T7 RNA polymerases , these produced labeled RNA molecular mass markers ranging in size between 48 and 291 nucleotides .
Results from the 5'-probe 20.2 are shown in Fig .
44 .
As expected , a 184-nucleotide band , corresponding to Pax-5 transcripts that contain exon 2 , was present in all pro- , pre- , and mature B-cell lines tested .
This band was not detectable in the plasmacytoma lines or in the T-cell line tested .
The levels of the 184-nucleotide band were relatively high in most B-cell lines , except for the pre-B-cell line 18-8 and the mature B-cell line A20/2J .
The only tissue that had detectable levels of the 184-nucleotide band was the spleen .
In isoforms Pax-5b and Pax-5e , where the second exon has been spliced out , a 46-nucleotide fragment ( covering nucleotides 1-46 ) would be expected ( Fig .
44 ) .
This fragment was indeed present in all pro- , pre- , and mature B-cells tested ( Fig .
4A ) , although at a much lower intensity in all cases .
This is not only a function of the lower level of this transcript , but also of 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog Alternative Splicing of the Pax-5 Gene pro-B mature B PC T Ed 7 T i a - ma h in E & w x s w , in fo Poi i f P g I : & = a & < a m s ] & % ¥ it `` £. , p '' « ) + - 66 .s ~s : me ermm ... .. i > messes : ___ b $ a 46 *s w - 30 Fig .

Western blot analysis of Pax-5 isoforms using polyclonal rabbit anti-Pax-5a/5b antiserum OC-1 .
This antiserum is specific for Pax-5a and Pax-5b and does not detect Pax-5d or Pax-5e protein ( see `` Results '' ) .
The second through eighth lanes contain nuclear extracts as indicated .
The first and ninth lanes contain in vitro trans-lated , [ °°S ] Met-labeled Pax-5a and Pax-5b isoforms , using Pax-5a DNA as the template .
The size of isoform Pax-5a is indicated with an open arrowhead , and that of Pax-5b ( translated off the Pax-5a transcript ) with a closed arrowhead .
Molecular mass markers ( in kilodaltons ) are indicated on the right .
P.C , plasmacytoma .
the relative amount of label incorporated into this smaller fragment .
Following extended exposure to x-ray film , very low levels of the 46-nucleotide fragment could also be detected in the plasmacytoma lines SP2/0 and XS63 and in the plasmacytoma line $ 194 ( data not shown ) , but not in the T-cell line EL-4 .
The only tissue that clearly showed this 46-nucleotide fragment was the spleen .
An additional protected band of ~135 nucleotides was detected in all pro- , pre- , and mature B-cell lines , but not in the plasmacytoma or T-cell lines ( Fig .
44 ) .
This band was also clearly detected in spleen tissue .
The size of this band corresponds to a transcript that does not contain exon 1 ( see Fig .
3 ) .
Recently , Busslinger et al .
( 26 ) reported the presence of a second promoter downstream from exon 1 .
This is in agreement with the presence of the 135-nucleotide fragment because both promoters are active in B-cells ( 26 ) .
Interestingly , the ratio of the 184- to 135-nucleotide bands varied among the different cell lines .
This was most strikingly visible in the mature B-cell line A20/2J .
In this cell line , the 184-nucleotide band was relatively weak , whereas the 185-nucleotide band was very strong .
For the 2.1AJP4 pro-B-cell line , both bands had similar intensity .
Most other B-cell lines had a much stronger 184-nucleotide band relative to the 185-nucleotide band .
This pattern was not the result of degraded RNA ( for example , in A20/2J ) , as the quality of RNA was tested for all samples using the tubulin ( pu ) probe ( Fig .
4C ) .
This would imply that the activity of the two promoters varies among certain B-cell lines , most clearly in A20/2J .
One additional protected band was clearly present in the cell line A20/2J , but not in any other samples .
This band is ~108 nucleotides long , and its origin is unclear .
RNase protection assays were particularly important to show that isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e were real and not the result of artifacts during the creation of the cDNA libraries , which can sometimes lead to hybrid clones .
A 392-nucleotide RNA probe ( 10.1 ) was used , covering nucleotides 447-735 of Pax-5d and Pax-be , resulting in a 288-nucleotide protected fragment .
This probe should also protect nucleotides 447-607 of the Pax-5a and Pax-5b isoforms , resulting in a 160-nucleotide fragment .
Fig .
4B shows the results of this experiment .
Relatively high levels of the 288-nucleotide band , unique to isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e , were detected in all pro- , pre- , and mature B-cell 10165 lines , but not in two plasmacytomas or in the T-cell line EL-4 .
The 288-nucleotide band is also present at relatively high levels in spleen tissue and clearly in testis .
As expected , a 160-nucleotide band , corresponding to isoforms Pax-5a and Pax-56b , was found in the same tissues and cell lines as the 288-nucleotide band , although the intensity of the 160-nucleotide band is ~10-50-fold higher than that of the 288-nucleotide band .
No obvious variation in relative intensity of the 288-nucleotide versus the 160-nucleotide band was noted in each individual B-cell line or tissue tested .
It should be noted that in testis , the 10.1 probe detects a strong 160-nucleotide band , in contrast to a nondetectable signal using the 5'-probe ( 20.2 ) ( compare testis samples in Fig .
4 , A versus B ) .
This is likely the result of the presence of a second downstream promoter that is active in this tissue , as reported by others ( 6 ) .
Some additional bands are detected using the 10.1 probe , including a 270-nucleotide and a 105-nucleotide protected band , with a B-cell and tissue distribution identical to that of the 288-nucleotide band , although with a lower intensity .
The origin of these bands is unclear , but may be the result of additional alternatively spliced isoforms of Pax-5 .
Finally , a strong band of ~120 nucleotides was detected in the cell line 2PK3 only .
Its size could suggest that it may represent a new Pax-5 isoform that contains the novel sequence , but has deleted a region immediately upstream of nucleotide 607 ; such an isoform would appear as a band with a theoretical size of 128 nucleotides ( Fig .
3 ) .
Presence of Alternative Forms of Pax-5 Protein in B-cell Lines-To investigate the presence of alternative isoforms of Pax-5 protein , nuclear extracts from various B-cell lines as well as from one T-cell line were separated by size on SDS-polyacrylamide gels , and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper .
Western analysis was performed using polyclonal rabbit antiserum OC-1 ( specific to isoforms Pax-5a and Pax-5b ) .
Unfortunately , we had no antisera available to detect Pax-5d and Pax-5e .
To identify bands corresponding to Pax-5a and Pax-5b , a plasmid containing full-length Pax-5u cDNA sequence was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of radiolabeled [ °°S ) methionine .
The resulting in vitro translated protein products , containing both Pax-5a and Pax-5b , were used in parallel with the nuclear extracts during gel electrophoresis and nitrocellulose filter transfer and were visualized by exposure to x-ray film .
One strong 53-kDa band , identical in size to the in vitro translated isoform Pax-5a , was observed in all nuclear extracts derived from pro- and mature B-cell lines , but not in two plasma cell lines or in the T-cell line , as shown in Fig .
5 .
This band was also detected in the pre-B-cell line 702/83 ( data on this cell line not shown ) .
A weak 41-kDa band , corresponding to the Pax-5b isoform , was detected in pre- and mature B-cell lines and in one of the two plasma cell lines tested ( SP2/0 ) .
No Pax-5b was detected in the second plasmacytoma cell line ( RPC5.4 ) , in two pro-B-cell lines , or in the T-cell line EL-4 ( Fig .
5 ) .
An additional band of ~38 kDa with an expression pattern similar to that of Pax-5b was also detected ( Fig .
5 ) .
The origin of this latter band is unclear , but its expression pattern suggests that it may represent an additional isoform of Pax-5 .
Interactions of Pax-5 Isoforms with a BSAP-binding Site in Vitro-To investigate the DNA binding properties of the various Pax-5 isoforms , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the DNA fragment F3 from the murine bik promoter ( nucleotides -70 to 136 ) , which contains a BSAP-binding site at nucleotides -68 to -38 ( 10 ) .
In vitro translated Pax-5 isoforms were used in parallel with the extracts to enable identification of retarded DNA : Pax-5 complexes on the gel .

Mobility shift assays using probe F3 , which contains one BSAP-binding site .
Open arrowheads indicate the F3 probe associated with Pax-5a ; closed arrowheads indicate the F3 probe associated with Pax-5d .
A , comparison of binding affinity for the BSAP site between in vitro translated Pax-5a and Pax-5d .
Molar concentrations for Pax-5a and Pax-5d were determined ( see `` Results '' ) , and various ratios of the two lysates were mixed and incubated with the F3 probe .
The relative molar amounts are indicated at the top .
B , detection of Pax-5d protein in the nuclear extracts of some B-cell lines .
Second through eighth lanes , nuclear extracts ; ninth through eleventh lanes , in vitro translated Pax-5 .
The complex indicated by the closed arrowhead disappears after adding excess competitor F38 , both in nuclear extract from 2PK3 ( fifth lane ) and in in vitro translated Pax-5d ( tenth lane ) .
Initially , the four in vitro translated Pax-5 isoforms were incubated with the F3 DNA probe and analyzed for the presence of retarded bands .
As expected , in vitro translated Pax-50 and Pax-5d , both containing intact DNA-binding domains , were able to bind to the F3 probe ( Fig .
6A , tenth and second lanes , respectively ) , whereas Pax-5b and Pax-5e did not ( data not shown ) .
To test the relative affinity of Pax-5a and Pax-5d for the -binding site on the bik promoter , both were translated in vitro in the presence of [ °°S ) methionine .
The fact that both isoforms contain two methionine residues was used to determine the relative amount of the two isoforms .
The translated products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis ; labeled Pax-5a and Pax-5d were cut out ; and [ °°S ) methionine incorporation of each was counted in a scintillation counter .
Various relative molar ratios of the two in vitro translated proteins were then incubated with the F3 probe .
The resulting mobility shift pattern indicates that Pax-5a and Pax-5d proteins had a very similar affinity for the BSAP-binding site on the bik promoter , as shown in Fig .
6A .
Next , we investigated the presence of Pax-5d in B-lymphoid nuclear extracts .
As a control , we used in vitro translated Pax-5d bound to the F3 probe .
A retarded band corresponding in position to the F3 probePax-5d complex was detectable at Alternative Splicing of the Pax-5 Gene low levels in three of the six cell lines tested ( Fig .
6B , second through fourth lanes ) , including a plasmacytoma , a pro-B-cell , and a mature B-cell line ( $ 107.3.4 , 2.1 APJ4 , and 2PK3 , respec-tively ) .
Competition shifts using an excess of unlabeled oligo-nucleotide F38 ( which contains the bik BSAP -binding site ; see `` Materials and Methods '' ) and nuclear extract from the mature B-cell line 2PK3 indicated that protein binding occurs specifically at the BSAP -binding site .
( Fig .
6B , fifth lane ) .
In addition , competition shift assays in which excess in vitro translated Pax-5ba was added to the 2PK3 nuclear extract resulted in the disappearance of the F3 probePax-5d complex ( data not shown ) .
A possible cytoplasmic localization of the various isoforms was investigated by mobility shift assay using cytoplasmic ( 8-100 ) fractions collected during the preparation of the nuclear extracts ( 10 ) .
From these experiments , it was clear that none of the four Pax-5 isoforms are present at detectable levels in the cytoplasm of the B-cell lines ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Pax-5 , a member of the Pax family of transcription factors , encodes the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP , which plays important roles in transcriptional regulation during B-lymphoid development .
Here we describe experiments demonstrating the presence of alternative isoforms of the Pax-5 gene as well as interactions between its encoded products and the BSAP-binding site in vitro .
In addition to the published Pax-5 sequence , which we have named Pax-5a , three alternative isoforms of Pax-5 transcripts were detected , Pax-5b , Pax-5d , and Pax-be .
Two types of splice variants were found : Pax-5b and Pax-5be have spliced out their second exon , resulting in an incomplete DNA-binding domain , whereas Pax-5d and Pax-5e have replaced a region containing the transactivating domain with a novel sequence .
Pax-5b Is Present in the Nucleus of B-lymphoid Cells , but Does Not Interact with the BSAP-binding Site-The presence of Pax-5b protein appears to correlate with the differentiation stage of the B-cell lines .
For example , pro-B-cells had no detectable levels of Pax-5b , but this protein becomes detectable during later stages of B-cell development .
Because the levels of Pax-5a are relatively high during all stages of development until the plasma cell stage , at which point Pax-5a expression ceases , the relative level of Pax-5b increases during B-cell development .
This pattern became even more pronounced with comparison of Pax-5b levels between mature B-cell and plasma cell lines .
One highly differentiated mature B-cell line ( A20/2 ) ) had decreased levels of Pax-5a and slightly increased levels of Pax-5b .
Even more striking was the situation in the plasma cell line SP2/0 , which had undetectable levels of Pax-5a , whereas Pax-5b was clearly detectable .
This expression pattern may indicate an important regulatory role for this alternatively spliced product in transcriptional regulation .
The affinity of Pax-5b for the BSAP-binding site on the bik promoter was tested by mobility shift assay .
No retarded bands were detected using in vitro translated Pax-5 under conditions where isoform Pax-5a bound strongly .
This is in agreement with a report by Czerny et al .
( 27 ) , who showed that the region on Pax-5 encoded by exon 2 ( which is absent in Pax-5b ) is essential for DNA binding .
From our data , we hypothesize that Pax-5b , although it may no longer be able to interact with the BSAP site , will still be able to interact with other regulatory proteins .
Possible functions for Pax-5b include that of a co-repressor , by competing with Pax-5a for binding to as yet unidentified regulatory molecules , or , alternatively , a co-acti-vator , by interacting with other transcription factors .
We can not rule out , however , the possibility that Pax-5b will still bind 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog Alternative Splicing of the Pax-5 Gene BSAP sites of selected target genes , albeit with much lower affinity .
Whether or not the alternatively spliced isoform Pax-5b will have significant effects on B-cell development in vivo is not known .
In this regard , such a function has been shown to exist for the pou-2 gene , a member of the Pou domain-containing genes , which are important regulators of early development and differentiation ( 28 ) .
In this case , the alternative form , t-pou-2 , lacked DNA binding activity because its DNA-binding domain was incomplete .
Although this alternative form had no binding activity in vitro ( using mobility shift assays ) , overexpression of in embryos caused severe developmental retardation .
It was hypothesized that t-pou-2 is involved in negative regulation of a set of genes required for further embryonic development , probably through interactions with other regulatory proteins ( 28 ) .
Alternative Splicing of Pax-5 Results in Two Isoforms with a Novel 3'-Sequence ( Pax-5d and Pax-5e ) -The splice site used in isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e ( between nucleotides 606 and 607 ) represents the intron-exon boundary between exons 5 and 6 ( 26 ) .
Interestingly , the intron-exon boundary at nucleotide 606 falls between two conserved sequences shared by the majority of the Pax family members : the octamer sequence encoded by exon 5 , which is present in all four Pax-5 isoforms ( nucleotides 535-558 ) , and the homeodomain homology box encoded by exon 6 , which is present in isoforms Pax-5a and Pax-56 ( nucleotides 685-753 ) , but absent in Pax-5d and Pax-5e .
As the functions of these two conserved domains are unknown , the significance of this alternative splice site remains to be determined .
In addition to the absence of the homeobox homology sequence , Pax-5d and Pax-5e have also deleted the region encoding the transactivating domain .
The genomic position of the novel sequence in the Pax-5 gene is not known .
It is possible that the novel Pax-5d sequence is an as yet unidentified alternative exon , comparable to PAX-3 , which contains alternative exons 4A and 4B ( 15 ) .
Alternatively , this sequence may be an exon downstream from the exons present in Pax-5a and Pax-5b .
In any case , the replacement of the 3'-segment of Pax-5 by this novel sequence may result in profound changes in its activator function .
This idea is supported by co-transfection studies using Pax-8 isoforms that vary at their C termini .
These isoforms showed significant differences in their transactivating potential as measured in transcriptional activation of a reporter gene , depending on the structure of their C termini ( 8 ) .
Pax-5d Is Detectable in Nuclear Extracts of Certain B-cell Lines , where It Interacts with the BSAP-binding Site-Unfor-tunately , we could not detect isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e by Western blot analysis because we were not able to produce polyclonal anti-Pax-5 antibodies in rabbits that would recognize Pax-5d and Pax-5e ( attempts were made with three different Pax-5 peptides ) .
To investigate the presence of Pax-5d protein in B-lymphoid cells , we used the mobility shift assay instead .
Using both in vitro translated Pax-5d and B-cell nuclear extracts in the same experiment , we could show that Pax-5d 1 ) is present at low levels in some B-lymphoid lines , 2 ) can interact specifically with the BSAP site , and 3 ) has equal affinity for this site compared with Pax-5a .
The expression pattern of Pax-5d is clearly different from that of Pax-5b , although both are expressed at low levels .
As a direct result of the competition between Pax-5a and Pax-5d for binding to the BSAP site , we hypothesize that only little Pax-5d will be bound to its BSAP target site in situations where Pax-5a levels are high ( relative to Pax-5d ) .
Under conditions ( as yet unknown ) where the Pax-5a/Pax-5d ratio de-creases , relatively more Pax-5d can bind to its target sequence 10167 ( as compared with Pax-5a ) .
We hypothesize that in this latter situation , it has a dominant-negative function , down-regulat-ing expression of Pax-5 target genes .
Transcriptional repression of Pax-5 target genes could thus be controlled , at least to some extent , at the level of RNA splicing of the Pax-5 transcript .
What Are the Functions of Alternatively Spliced Pax-5 Prod-ucts ? -Several studies have pointed toward a role for Pax-5 in cell growth and proliferation .
For example , overexpression of Pax-5 by transient transfection induces proliferation of splenic B-cells or plasmacytomas ( 29 ) , whereas injection of cells over-expressing various Pax proteins in mice results in tumor formation ( 30 ) .
Pax-5 has also been shown to interact directly with a sequence on the basal promoter of the tumor suppressor gene p53 , where it suppresses its expression ( 31 ) .
Based on these and our own observations , it is possible that alternatively spliced Pax-5 products are involved in the specific suppression of Pax-5 target genes by direct interaction with the BSAP-binding site on these genes ( e.g .
Pax-5d ) and/or through interactions with other regulatory factors necessary for initiation of transcription ( e.g .
Pax-5b and Pax-5e ) .
( Temporary ) down-regulation of Pax-5 target genes could be particularly important during the differentiation phases the cell encounters during its development from a pro-B-cell to a plasma cell .
Alternatively , it is still possible that Pax-5b , Pax-5d , and Pax-5e can serve as positive regulators of transcription , depending on the presence of other transcription factors in the cell at a particular stage .
Future studies to address these questions will include the generation of transgenic mice that overexpress one of the alternative isoforms of Pax-5 .
In conclusion , we have identified three new isoforms of the Pax-5 gene , Pax-5b , Pax-5d , and Pax-be .
The structure of these isoforms , their expression pattern in B-cell lines , and their DNA binding characteristics in vitro suggest that they may serve important functions in the regulation of expression of Pax-5 target genes during B-cell development .
