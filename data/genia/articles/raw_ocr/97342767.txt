7 Anti-Ehrlichia chaffeensis Antibody Complexed with E. chaffeensis Induces Potent Proinflammatory Cytokine mRNA Expression in Human Monocytes through Sustained Reduction of IxB- « and Activation of NF-KB EUNJOO H. LEE anp YASUKO RIKIHISA '' * Molecular , Cellular and Developmental Biology Program '' and Department of Veterinary Biosciences , '' Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 Received 11 October 1996/Returned for modification 22 January 1997/Accepted 11 April 1997 Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that infects monocytes and macrophages and is the etiologic agent of human ehrlichiosis in the United States .
Our previous studies showed that the exposure of human monocytes to £ .
chaffeensis induces the expression of interleukin-1B ( IL-1B ) , IL-8 , and IL-10 genes in vitro but not the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( LNF-a « ) and IL-6 mRNAs .
In this study , the effect of anti-£ .
chaffeensis antibody complexed with E. chaffeensis on the expression of major proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes was examined .
Human monocytic cell line THP-1 was treated with £ .
chaffeensis which had been preincubated with human anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum for 2 h , and the levels of cytokine mRNAs were evaluated by competitive reverse transcription-PCR .
Anti- .
chaffeensis antibody complexed with E. chaffeensis significantly enhanced mRNA expression of IL-1f§ in THP cells .
The expression of TNF- « and IL-6 mRNAs was also induced .
The levels of secreted IL-1 $ , TNF-a @ , and IL-6 during 24 h of stimulation were comparable to those induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at 1 pg/ml .
Fab fragment of anti-E. chaffeensis immunoglobulin G complexed with E. chaffeensis did not induce any of these three cytokines , indicating that ehrlichial binding is required for IL-1B mRNA expression and that binding of the immune complex to the Fey receptor is required for TNF-a and IL-6 mRNA expression and enhanced IL-1 mRNA expression .
Furthermore , prolonged degradation of IxB- « @ and activation of NF-KB were demonstrated in THP-1 cells exposed to anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum and E. chaffeensis .
This result implies that development of anti-£ .
chaffeensis antibody in patients can result in the production of major proinflammatory cytokines , which may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ehrlichiosis and immune responses to it .
Ehrlichia chaffeensis , a gram-negative obligately intracellular bacterium that can infect monocytes and macrophages ( 32 ) , is recognized as the etiologic agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis in the United States ( 1 , 11 ) .
Since the discovery of the disease in 1986 , more than 400 cases of human ehrlichiosis have been reported in 30 states in the United States ( 14 ) .
A PCR assay detected E. chaffeensis DNA in the Lone Star tick , Amblyomma americanum , implying that this tick is a vector of the disease ( 2 ) .
Seven to nine days after a tick bite , patients develop fever , headache , malaise , thrombocytopenia , leukope-nia , and elevated liver enzyme activities and C-reactive-protein levels ( 16 ) .
These clinical signs were similar to those mediated by proinflammatory cytokines , including interleukin-1B ( IL-1 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) , and IL-6 .
However , we were puzzled , since our previous results showed that £ .
chaffeensis induces IL-1B but not TNF- « or IL-6 in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and human peripheral blood monocytes ( 22 ) .
E. chaffeensis-infected patients develop a high titer of antibody ; therefore , a serologic test has been used as the primary diagnostic method ( 12 ) .
Although in human monocytic ehrlichiosis no correlation of clinical signs and antibody development has been reported , in experimental Ehrlichia canis infection of dogs and Ehrlichia risticii infection of horses the development of clinical signs coincides with formation of the * Corresponding author .

2890 antibody to E. canis and E. risticii , respectively ( 20 , 34 ) .
Cross-linking of Fc receptors on monocytes by anti-Fc receptor antibody or immobilized immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) was reported to induce TNF- « , IL-1 , IL-6 , and IL-8 production in human monocytes ( 13 , 21 , 25 , 26 , 31 ) .
Therefore , we examined whether the complex of anti-£ .
chaffeensis antibody and E. chaffeensis induces a strong proinflammatory cytokine response in human monocytes and whether this response is mediated through Fey receptors .
The mechanism by which cross-linking Fc receptors induce cytokines in monocytes is unknown ; however , transcription factor NF- « B is known to be involved in induction of cytokine gene expression by various stimuli , including lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 10 , 18 , 23 ) .
We therefore further examined whether the complex of E. chaffeensis and anti-E. chaffeensis antibody induces NF-kB activation in human monocytes .
This study revealed an important new role of antibody for host defense and pathogenesis during intracellular bacterial infection .
MATERIALS AND METHODS E. chaffeensis .
E. chaffeensis Arkansas was cultured in THP-1 cells as previously described ( 22 ) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Atlanta Biologicals , Norcross , Ga. ) and 2 mM 1-Gin ( GIBCO , Grand Island , N.Y. ) .
When more than 90 % of the cells were infected , as determined by examining cells stained with Diff-Quik ( Baxter Scientific Products , Obetz , Ohio ) , the infected cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min .
The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min , and the pellet , containing host cell-free E. chaffeensis organisms , was used to infect THP-1 cells .
Treatment of cells .
For competitive reverse transcription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) analysis , 10 '' THP-1 cells in 5 ml of medium were treated with each stimulus for 2 h and harvested for RNA isolation .
For electrophoretic mobility shift and Western immunoblot assays , 10° cells in 1 ml of medium were incubated with each stimulus for the periods indicated in the figures and nuclear and cytoplasmic Vou .
65 , 1997 extracts were prepared .
Human anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum was kindly provided by J. R. Harkens and J. Kudlak of the Oklahoma State Department of Health ( homologous-antibody titer = 1:640 by the indirect fluorescent-antibody [ IFA ] test ) ( 33 ) .
Dog anti-Z .
chaffeensis serum was developed as previously described ( IFA titer = 1:5,120 ) ( 6 ) .
Normal dog serum was negative for £ .
chaffeensis by the IFA test .
Normal human serum was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , Mo . )
and negative by the IFA test .
The sera were preabsorbed with 10° uninfected THP-1 cells per ml by incubation at 37°C for 1 h and used at 0.2 ml per ml of incubation medium .
IgG and Fab fragment were purified from preabsorbed normal or dog anti- .
chaffeensis serum by using an ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit ( Pierce Chemical Co. , Rockford , IIL . )
and used at 0.1 mg per ml of incubation medium .
Preparation of Fab fragments was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-dog IgG as previously described ( 28 ) .
Competitive RT-PCR analysis .
Total RNA was isolated from the cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method ( 9 ) .
Total cellular RNA ( 2 mg ) was reverse transcribed in a 30-pl reaction mixture by using a kit ( first-strand cDNA synthesis kit ; Clontech Laboratories Inc. , Palo Alto , Calif. ) .
The prepared cDNA ( 1 to 2 pl ) was amplified in a 50-pl reaction mixture .
Conditions for PCR were as follows : 0.4 M each primer , 0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture ( Life Technologies , Inc. , Gaithersburg , Md .
) , 50 mM KCI , 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.3 ) , 1.5 mM MgCl , , and 2.0 U of Taq DNA polymerase ( Life Technologies ) .
Primers and nonhomologous internal standards ( PCR MIMICs ) for IL-1 and TNF-a and primers for IL-6 were purchased from Clontech Laboratories .
The PCR MIMIC for IL-6 was constructed by using a PCR MIMIC construction kit ( Clontech ) .
The amounts of MIMICs added to the PCR mixtures in the present study were 1 amol for IL-18 , TNF-a , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 107 '' amol for IL-6 .
Reaction mixtures were incubated in a DNA thermal cycler ( model 480 ; Perkin-Elmer ) for 30 cycles ( denaturation at 94°C for 45 s , annealing at 60°C for 45 s , extension at 72°C for 2 min } .
Aliquots of reaction products were electrophoresed in 1.8 % agarose gels containing 0.5 ug of ethidium bromide per ml .
The amounts of PCR products generated by the target and competitive internal standard were analyzed by a gel video system ( Gel Print 20001 ; BioPhotonics Corp. , Ann Arbor , Mich. ) and image analysis software ( ImageQuaNT ; Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
The ratio of target to internal standard was calculated and normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in the corresponding sample .
Nuclear- and cytoplasmic-extract preparation .
The nuclear extract for the NF- « B assay and the cytoplasmic extract for the IxB- « Western blot assay were prepared from the same experimental sample by the method of Schreiber et al .
( 37 ) .
Briefly , after the treatment described above , cells were centrifuged , washed with Tris-buffered saline ( pH 7.9 ) , and then suspended in 400 pl of cold buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 10 mM KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 wM aprotinin , 14 pM leupeptin , 1 wM pepstatin , 80 g of benzamidine per ml ) .
After being incubated on ice for 15 min , the cells were lysed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 ( final concentration of 0.6 % ) .
Lysis was completed by vigorous vortexing for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 30 s in a microcentrifuge , the supernatant was saved for cytoplasmic extract , and the nuclear pellet was resus-pended in 50 pl of cold buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 0.4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 wM aprotinin , 14 M leupeptin , 1 M pepstatin , 80 jg of benzamidine per ml ) .
After centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 30 s , the resulting supernatant of nuclear extract was stored in small aliquots at -80°C .
Protein concentrations were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent ( Pierce ) .
EMSA .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed by using a gel shift assay system ( Promega Corp. , Madison , Wis. ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
The NF-xB consensus oligonucleotide ( 22 bp ) provided in the kit was end labeled with [ y-* '' P ] ATP with T4 nucleotide kinase , and 100,000 cpm of the probe was used to assess NF-kB binding .
The reaction mixture for DNA-protein interaction contained 2 pg of the nuclear extract in 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) -1 mM MgCl1 , -0.5 mM EDTA-0.5 mM dithiothreitol-50 mM NaCl-0.05 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) per pl in 4 % glycerol in a final volume of 25 pul .
The radioactive DNA probe was added to this mixture and incubated at room temperature for 20 min .
For competition assays , a 50-fold-excess amount of unlabeled SP1 consensus oligonucleotide ( 22 bp ; Promega ) or NF- « B consensus oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture with the labeled oligonucleotide .
For supershift assay , 1 pl of rabbit antibody to p50 ( NF- « B1 ) or rabbit antibody to p65 ( RelA ) ( Rockland , Gilbertsville , Pa. ) was added to the extracts before incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide .
After incubation , the samples were first loaded onto a 4 % polyacrylamide gel ( 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA ) that had been prerun for 30 min and were then electrophoresed at 100 V for 4 h. The gel was exposed to an X-ray film ( X-Omat AR ; Kodak , Rochester , N.Y. ) at -80°C overnight .
After autoradiography , the gel was dried onto a piece of Whatman 3MM paper under vacuum at room temperature for 2 h and analyzed with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Western immunoblot analysis .
The cytoplasmic extracts ( 30 jg each ) prepared as described above were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Schlei-cher & Schuell Inc. , Keene , N.H. ) by using a semidry electroblotting apparatus .
Membranes were blocked overnight in Tween-phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS- CYTOKINE INDUCTION BY E. CHAFFEENSIS AND ANTIBODY - 2891 Tween ) containing 5 % nonfat milk powder .
The membranes were then incubated with rabbit antiserum to IxB- « ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) at 1 pg/ml in blocking solution at room temperature for 45 min and washed in PBS-Tween .
Blots were then incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG ( Amersham Life Science Inc. , Arlington Heights , IIL . )
in blocking solution for 30 min and washed in PBS-Tween .
The antigen was detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer ( Amersham ) .
The same membrane was reprobed with a 1:1,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti- « -tubulin ( Cedarline Lab .
Limited , Hornby , Ontario , Canada ) to detect « -tubulin as an internal control .
Cytokine assays .
THP-1 cells or human peripheral blood monocytes isolated as previously described ( 22 ) were incubated at 10° cells per ml in 12-well culture plates with each stimulus for 24 h , and culture supernatants were assayed for each cytokine level according to the manufacturer 's protocol by using human cytokine immunoassay kits ( Quantikine ; R & D systems , Minneapolis , Minn. ) .
RESULTS E. chaffeensis organisms preincubated with human or dog anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum induce strong TNF-a @ , IL-6 , and IL-1B mRNA expression .
The conditions of the competitive RT-PCR were optimized as described elsewhere ( 22 ) .
We previously showed that THP -1 cell lysate used as a control for host cell substance contamination in £ .
chaffeensis preparation had no influence on cytokine mRNA expression in THP-1 cells ( 22 ) .
To examine the effect of anti-£E .
chaffeensis serum on the mRNA expression of major proinflammatory cytokines , THP-1 cells were treated with E. chaffeensis preincubated with me-dium , normal human serum , or anti-£ .
chaffeensis patient serum and TNF- « , IL-6 , and IL-18B mRNA expression was analyzed by competitive RT-PCR .
Figure 1 shows that £ .
chaffeensis preincubated with human anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum ( the titer of immunofluorescent antibody against E. chaffeensis was 1:640 ) induced strong TNF- « and IL-6 mRNA expression , which was not induced by E. chaffeensis alone or with normal human serum .
IL-1B mRNA expression by E. chaffeenis was enhanced in the presence of antiserum but not in the presence of normal human serum ( about fourfold ) .
Because of the limited availability of human anti- .
chaffeensis serum , we examined whether dog anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum ( the titer of immunofluorescent antibody against £ .
chaffeensis was 1:5,120 ) has a effect on cytokine mRNA induction similar to that of human antiserum and the optimum dosage of the dog immune serum in inducing cytokine mRNA expression .
As shown in Fig .
2 , dog anti- .
chaffeensis serum also strongly induced IL-1B , IL-6 , and TNF- « mRNA expression .
The maximum response was seen with a 10-fold dilution of dog anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum .
Cytokine mRNA expression with anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum is mediated by the Foy receptor .
Previously , cross-linking of Fey receptors with anti-Fcey receptor monoclonal antibody was reported to induce IL-18 , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF- « from human peripheral blood monocytes ( 13 , 21 , 25 , 26 , 31 ) .
We previously showed that E. risticii complexed with anti-£ .
risficii antibody binds to P388D , macrophages and that the Fab fragment of anti-£ .
risticii IgG blocks ehrlichial binding to either ehrlichial receptor or Fc receptor on P388D ; , cells ( 28 ) .
We speculated that ( i ) anti-E. chaffeensis antibody bound to E. chaffeensis interacts with Fey receptors that are on the monocyte surface and that ( ii ) this interaction is responsible for IL-6 , TNF- « , and enhanced IL-1B mRNA expression .
To test this hypothesis , THP-1 cells were exposed to E. chaffeensis preincubated with the dog immune serum , IgG , or Fab fragment purified from the immune serum , and cytokine mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the induction of TNF-a , IL-6 , and IL-1B mRNA expression in cells treated with E. chaffeensis in the presence of anti-E. chaffeensis IgG was as high as that in cells treated with E. chaffeensis in the presence of anti-£ .

After 2 h , total RNA was extracted and subjected to competitive RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods .

The data presented are from one of two independent experiments that gave similar results .

G3PDH , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase .
cubated with the Fab fragment of the immune IgG did not induce any of three cytokines examined .
This may be due to the blockage of binding of the ehrlichial carbohydrate compo-nent , which was shown to be required for IL-1 induction ( 22 ) by the Fab fragment of anti-E. chaffeensis antibody .
IL-18B mRNA induction in the presence of anti-E. chaffeensis anti-body , therefore , most likely occurs independently from the receptor ( s ) for the ehrlichial carbohydrate .
This result indicates that interaction of anti-Ehrlichia IgG with Foy receptors on monocytes is required for induction of TNF- « and IL-6 mRNA and for enhanced IL-18 mRNA expression .
Secretion of IL-1 $ B , IL-6 , and TNF- « @ by THP-1 cells .
To examine the protein synthesis and secretion of cytokines , we determined cytokine levels secreted by THP-1 cells by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
As shown in Table 1 , normal serum did not have an effect on E. chaffeensis-mediated secretion of IL-18B , IL-6 , and TNF- « .

chaffeensis serum and E. chaffeensis .
IxB-a « is a cytoplasmic protein ( 37 kDa ) that binds to NF-kB and inhibits the binding of NF- « B to its cognate binding site by masking the nuclear localization signal of NF-kB ( 3 , 5 ) .
Upon activation of cells with various extracellular signals such as LPS , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , IL-1 , or TNF-a , IxB-a « is rapidly degraded , allowing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus and bind to an NF- « B-responsive DNA element ( 19 ) .
We examined the changes in cytoplasmic IxB- « protein levels by Western blot analysis to determine whether IxB- « degradation correlates with NF- « B activation .
As shown in Fig .

In cells exposed to dog anti-£ .

chaffeensis .
( A ) THP-1 cells were treated with host cell-free E. chaffeensis in the presence or absence of dog anti-F. chaffeensis serum .
At the indicated times , nuclear extracts were prepared and levels of active NF-xB were assessed in EMSAs as described in Materials and Methods .
These autoradiograms are from one of two independent experiments with similar results .
The positions of p65/p50 , p50/p50 , and free probe are marked .
( B ) The gels used for panel A were dried onto 3MM papers , and the intensities of the bands were analyzed with a PhosphorImager .
Levels of activated NF- « B ( p65/p50 ) were corrected against the 0-h value .
( C ) Nuclear extracts were prepared from THP-1 cells stimulated for 1 h with medium ( lanes 1 and 5 ) or £ .
chaffeensis preincubated with anti- .
chaffeensis serum ( lanes 2 to 4 , 6 , 8 , and 9 ) .
EMSA was performed on nuclear extracts preincubated with no reagents ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) , unlabeled SP1 consensus oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) , unlabeled NF-xB consensus oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) , anti-p50 antibody ( lane 8 ) , or anti-p65 antibody ( lane 9 ) .
Anti-p50 antibody incubated with radioactive NF-xB probe without nuclear extract was included as a negative control ( lane 7 ) .
significant role in host immune defense in infectious diseases as well as in ehrlichial infection through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( 27 ) and in vitro neutralization of infection ( 28 , 35 ) .
The role of antibody in proinflammatory cytokine induction in infectious diseases has , however , been overlooked because in most infections , the agent ( virus , bac-terium , or protozoan ) itself causes a significant cytokine production .
Our results also demonstrate that antibody complexed with ehrlichias enhances proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression through the Fey receptor .
It was already known that Fc receptor cross-linking leads to the production of IL-1B , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF- « in human monocytes ( 13 , 21 , 25 , 26 , 31 ) .
However , the signaling mechanism of cytokine production by Fey receptor cross-linking in human monocytes was not known , although a recent report showed that stimulation of a mouse macrophage cell line with immobilized IgG2a leads to NF-kB activation ( 29 ) .
NF-kB regulates the expression of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses , including many cytokine genes , such as those for TNF- « , IL-18 , IL-6 , and IL-8 .
NF- « xB becomes activated in response to viruses , bacteria , inflammatory cytokines , and PMA ( 4 ) .
Several recent studies examined the time-course effects of these stimuli on NF- « B activation and IxB- « degradation .

Effect of dog anti-£ .
chaffeensis serum on the degradation of IxB- « in THP-1 cells exposed to E. chaffeensis .
THP-1 cells were treated with host cell-free E. chaffeensis in the presence or absence of dog anti-E. chaffeensis serum .
At the indicated times , cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and levels of IxB- « were assessed by Western blot assays as described in Materials and Methods .
The levels of « -tubulin were included as an internal control .
cells stimulated with TNF- « or LPS , IxB-a « was rapidly degraded , but after 1 h of stimulation , IxB- « protein reappeared ( 36 ) .
In U937 cells activated by TNF-a or PMA plus ionomy-cin , IxB- « was rapidly decayed within 10 min but reappeared at between 20 and 40 min ( 7 ) .
In the pre-B-cell line 70Z % /3 , both PMA and IL-1 caused rapid decay of IxB- « within 5 min , and IxB- « protein began to reappear after 40 min of stimulation with PMA ( 19 ) .
The decay of IKB- « coincided with the appearance of NF- « B DNA-binding activity in these studies .
In-terestingly , our data show that the degradation of IxB- « and the activation of NF- « B in cells exposed to chaffeensis antibody and E. chaffeensis persisted longer than the other stimulations described above .
The sustained NF- « B activation may play a role in the induction of major proinflammatory cytokines by anti- .
chaffeensis antibody and E. chaffeensis .
We previously showed that E. risficii organisms induced significantly lower levels of IL-6 , TNF- « , and prostaglandin E , ; in mouse peritoneal macrophages than Escherichia coli LPS induces ( 38 ) .
We also showed that IL-1 B , IL-8 , and IL-10 but not TNF- « and IL-6 are induced in human monocytes and THP-1 cells infected with £ .
chaffeensis ( 22 ) .
Thus , weak proinflammatory cytokine production might be advantageous for ehrlichiae by allowing them to remain undetected and establish an infection ; however , once the host manages to make antiehrlichial antibodies , ehrlichiae may be eliminated not only by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and neutralization but also by inducing large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines through the sustained activation of NF-kB .
Induction of cytokines by LPS is known to be mediated through the activation of NF-kB ( 10 , 18 , 23 ) .
The present data also show that interaction of the complex of anti-£ .
chaffeensis antibody and E. chaffeensis with the Foy receptor activates NF-kB .
Although the precise mechanisms of activation of the common transcription factor by two different receptors have not been documented , several research groups recently reported that LPS induces activation of several protein kinases , such as mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) , protein kinase C , and -dependent protein kinase ( 39 ) .
A tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibits LPS-induced expression of IL-1 , TNF- « , and IL-6 ( 17 ) .
In addition , herbimycin A inhibits LPS-induced NF- « B complex formation in Jurkat T lymphoma cells ( 24 ) .
MAPK has also been reported to be involved in signal transduction through the FeyRI receptor in human monocytic cells ( 15 ) .
This result suggests that the CD14 receptor and the Fey receptor may have a common upstream path-way , such as MAPK activation leading to NF-kB activation .
E. chaffeensis in the absence of immune serum can induce NF- « xB translocation .
Recent reports have shown that in some pathogenic bacteria , cell wall components other than LPS promote NF-kB activation in a monocytic or macrophage cell line .
For example , lipoarabinomannans from different strains of My cobacterium tuberculosis have been demonstrated to differentially stimulate the activation of NF-kB in murine macrophages ( 8 ) .
Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteins were shown to induce both NF-kB activation and cytokine production in THP-1 cells , and this induction pathway was proposed to be distinct from the CD14-dependent pathway employed by LPS , since transfection of a CD14-negative pre-B-cell line with the human CD14 gene imparted responsiveness to LPS but not to the lipopeptides of 7. pallidum and B. burgdorferi ( 30 ) .
Although the receptor ( s ) for Ehrlichia organisms has not been identified yet , our previous results showed that E. chaffeensis-mediated IL-1B induction in THP-1 cells does not involve CD14 ( 22 ) .
Data from the present study suggest that both the ehrlichial receptor and the Foy receptor are able to induce NF- « B activation but that signals mediated by the ehrlichial receptor produce a different kinetics of NF-kB activation , i.e. , activation that is much weaker and shorter than that mediated by the Foy receptor .
The levels of secreted proinflammatory cytokines induced by anti-£ .
chaffeensis antibody and E. chaffeensis in THP-1 cells were comparable to those in cells stimulated with LPS .
Therefore , in the presence of anti-£ .
chaffeensis antibody the effect of E. chaffeensis on the host can be as detrimental as endotoxic shock .
This generation of proinflammatory cytokines may cause temporary damage in the host but concurrently contribute to antiehrlichial mechanisms by activating protective immune responses against ehrlichiae .
The data presented in this paper show that the antibody against ehrlichiae has an additional significant role in immune protection and pathology in ehrlichial infection .
