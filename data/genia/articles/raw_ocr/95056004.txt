12 Enhanced Responsiveness to Nuclear Factor kB Contributes to the Unique Phenotype of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Variant SIV gnmpBj14 SHEILA C.

This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of previously described mutations in the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and to elucidate their contribution to the unique phenotype of LTR-directed transcription was measured by using luciferase reporter constructs that were transiently transfected into cultured cells .
In a wide range of cell types , the basal transcriptional activity of the LTR from SIV was found to be 2- to 4.5-fold higher than that of an LTR from a non-acutely pathogenic strain .
These LTRs differ by five point mutations and a 22-bp duplication in SIV ... upg ; 14 , Which includes a nuclear factor « B ( NFB ) site .
Transcriptional differences between these LTRs were further enhanced by two-to threefold upon treatment of cells with phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha or by cotransfection with plasmids expressing NFB subunits .
Mutagenesis studies , and the use of a reporter construct containing an enhancerless promoter , indicate that these transcriptional effects are due principally to the 22-bp sequence duplication and the NFB site contained within it .
Finally , infectious virus stocks that were isogenic except for the LTR were generated .
The LTR from SIV ... upg ; , , was found to confer an increase in the kinetics of virus replication in cultured cells .
Inclusion of this LTR in recombinant SIVs also resulted in a two- to threefold rise in the extent of cellular proliferation that was induced in quiescent simian peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that LTR mutations assist in responding efficiently to cellular stimulation and allow it to replicate to high titers during the acute phase of viral infection .
Simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) infection in experimentally inoculated rhesus macaques typically results in the induction of an AIDS-like disease characterized by wasting , diarrhea , thymic atrophy , depletion of CD4* lymphocytes , opportunistic infections , central nervous system degeneration , and death within 5 to 18 months ( 39 , 45 ) .
These properties , together with the close genetic similarity between SIV and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 ( HIV-1 and HIV-2 ) , make the SIV/macaque model ideal for the study of AIDS pathogenesis .
The disease induced by HIV-1 and SIV is slow and progres-sive , and it is preceded by an acute viral syndrome that occurs within the first 2 weeks of infection , prior to seroconversion .
Acute-phase HIV-1 disease is marked by a peak of antigenemia , viremia , and widespread viral dissemination throughout the lymphoid organs ( 14 , 15 ) .
The clinical presentation includes flu-like symptoms , diarrhea , lymphadenopathy , rash , fever , and malaise ( 11 ) , followed by a long asymptomatic period in which virus replication continues in the lymphoid sites that were presumably seeded during the acute syndrome ( 21 , 51 ) .
In the case of SIV , less is known concerning the acute phase of infection ; however within the first 2 weeks of infection , SIV-infected macaques develop many of the same symp- * Corresponding author .

One strain of SIV , SIV ; , , , pp ; 14 , induces an especially severe acute-phase infection in experimentally inoculated pig-tailed macaques ( Macaca nemestrina ) .
This syndrome is marked by very severe gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea and by death in most cases between 7 and 10 days postinoculation ( 25 , 32 , 40 ) .
Gut-associated lymphoid areas are heavily involved in the disease pathogenesis , and there is a profound local inflammatory reaction , marked by lymphoid hyperplasia , tissue dam-age , and high serum levels of certain cytokines , including interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) ( 8 , 59 ) .
These findings may be related to SIV ; , .pg ; 14 's unique ability , among primate lentiviruses , to trigger proliferation of resting simian peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) in vitro ( 24 ) .
Biologic virus clones were derived from DY limiting-dilution cloning , resulting in the derivation of stocks with both acutely pathogenic ( AP ) ( bel-3 ) and non-acutely pathogenic ( NAP ) ( bel-1 ) phenotypes ( 25 ) .
SIV sequences from these stocks were subsequently cloned by PCR amplifi-cation , sequenced , and tested in vivo ( 16 ) .
An AP molecular clone of designated PBj-1.9 , was derived ( 16 ) , and sequence analysis identified a total of fewer than 100 mutational changes ( 99 % sequence identity ) between this clone and the NAP bel-1 virus stock ( 17 ) .
Many of these changes map to the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
Most notably , bel-3 contains a tandem 22-bp duplication that contains a nuclear factor kB ( NFB ) site ( five of five clones ) , whereas bel-1 does not ( eight of eight clones ) .

68 , 1994 In the case Of SIV smmppji4 , it has been shown that several viral determinants , most notably the env gene , contribute to acute disease induction ( 49 ) .
However , the functional significance of the previously described LTR mutations in SIV inmpp ; i , remains uncertain , although several facts suggest that they may be important .
First , these LTR changes are highly conserved among acutely pathogenic clones of SIV mmppji4a ( 12 , 16 , 17 , 49 ) .
Second , there is precedent for similar mutations being important determinants of pathogenesis in other retroviruses ( 23 , 31 , 37 , 41 ) .
Third , many of the cytokines induced during HIV-1 or SIV infection , including IL-6 and TNF- « , are known to activate cellular transcription factors , including NFB ( 4 , 8 , 9 , 20 , 33 , 42 , 50 , 53 , 59 ) .
This interplay between cytokines and transcription factors may be particularly pertinent to in light of the duplicated NFB site in the LTR enhancer region of this virus ( 16 ) .
This study , therefore , evaluates the contribution of LTR changes to the unique phenotype Of SIV .nnpg ; i4 .
Two complementary assay systems were used to determine the functional significance of these LTR mutations .
First , transient transcriptional studies were performed in a wide variety of cell lines and primary cells , using LTR-luciferase reporter plasmids .
These were carried out in the presence or absence of agents known to stimulate NFB , including TNF- « .
Second , we constructed infectious SIVs in which LTR elements were exchanged between otherwise isogenic viruses .
Infection experiments using these viral stocks allowed us to determine the effects of LTR mutations on viral properties , including replication kinetics and the ability of the virus to trigger proliferation of resting PBMC from pig-tailed macaques .
The data presented show that sequence mutations in the SIV gnmppii4 LTR result in elevated levels of transcription and faster kinetics of viral replication .
Furthermore , the data indicate that these differences are due primarily to the presence of an additional NFKB site .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Maintenance of cells .
Unless otherwise indicated , the cell lines used in this research were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection or the NIH/NIAID AIDS Reagent Repository and were maintained under conditions recommended by the supplier .
Human cell lines included SW480 ( colon carcinoma ) , U-87MG ( astrocytoma ) , U-138MG ( astrocytoma ) , J-Jahn ( CD4* T cell ) , Jurkat ( CD4* T cell ) , CEM 174 ( CD4* B-cell/T-cell hybrid ) , and U937 ( monocytic ) .
Simian cell lines were ChM114 ( simian T-cell leukemia virus-transformed chimpanzee T cells ) and Si-IIA ( human T-cell leukemia virus type II [ HTLV-lIJ-transformed cynomolgus macaque T cells ) and were maintained as described previously ( 46 , 62 ) .
Primary human PBMC were isolated from human blood by using Ficoll-Paque as instructed by the manufacturer ( Pharmacia ) and were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 5 % IL-2 , and 1 % phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) prior to electroporation and without PHA after electropora-tion .
Plasmid construction .
Full-length LTR-luciferase plasmids were generated as follows .
PCR amplification was used to generate intact LTR elements from full-length SIV genomic clones PBj-1.9 ( AP ) and PBj-1.b ( NAP ) .
LTR sequences from ~560 to +321 were inserted into the luciferase expression vector pXP1 ( 48 ) as a HindlIII-to-Smal cassette and verified by DNA sequencing ( 57 ) .
Truncated LTR-luciferase plasmids were then made by digesting the full-length clones with HindIII and StuI to remove LTR sequences upstream of the Stul site at nucleotide -172 ( Fig .
1 ) .
A mutated derivative of the trun- CONTRIBUTION OF NFkB TO PHENOTYPE OF $ IVannmesia -_ 7801 cated NAP LTR-luciferase construct was also generated , in which a second copy of the previously identified 22-bp LTR enhancer element in SIV was inserted by PCR mutagenesis ( 30 ) using Pfu DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) ; this clone is designated NAP-M .
The same 22-bp element was also synthesized as an oligonucleotide , containing one or two copies of either the wild-type or the NFB mutant sequence ( see Fig .
4A ) , and cloned into the Smal and Xhol sites of pSluc2 , which contains the luciferase gene and the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) enhancerless promoter ( 48 ) .
Clones pWR1 and pWR2 contain one and two copies , respectively , of the wild-type 22-bp element .
In clones pMR1 and pMR2 , the GGG motif in the NFkB site was altered to the nonfunctional triplet motif , CTC ( 47 ) .
These clones thus contain one and two copies , respectively , of an NFkB mutant and a wild-type simian factor 3 ( SF3 ) sequence ( shown in Fig .
4A ) .
For Tat expression vectors , the SIV insert in clone pST ( 64 ) was replaced with tat coding sequences ( bases 6015 to 8699 ) from either clone PBj-3'-9 or clone PBj-3'-b ( 16 , 17 ) to generate clones capable of expressing AP- or NAP-Tat protein , respectively .
Transient expression assays .
SW480 , U-87MG , and U-138 MG cells were transfected by the low-CO , method of Chen and Okayama ( 13 ) in 60-mm-diameter plates , using 3 to 6 pug of total DNA per plate .
J-Jahn , Jurkat , U937 , and Si-IIA cell lines were electroporated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with 10 mM dextrose and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol ( 5 ) at a concentration of 2 X 10 '' cells per ml , using 15 ug of total DNA in 0.4-cm gap cuvettes at 960 F and 300 V. ChM114 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method , using 10 cells and 6 ug of total DNA ( 1 ) .
PBMC were electroporated in cytomix buffer under the conditions used for J-Jahn cells ( 63 ) .
Where noted , 1,3-phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; Sigma ) was added to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml at 14 h posttransfection , and cells were harvested 6 h thereafter .
TNF- « ( Genzyme ) was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml at 14 h after transfection , and cells were harvested 24 h later .
In experiments in which NFB expression vectors were used , cells were transfected with 8 pg of LTR-luciferase plasmid plus 4 pg of each NFKB plasmid or 8 mg of pUC19 ( negative control ) and harvested for luciferase assays 42 h after transfection .
In experiments in which Tat expression vectors were used , cells were transfected with 10 mg of LTR-luciferase plasmid plus 10 g of SIV Tat plasmid or 10 ug of pUC19 ( negative control ) and harvested for luciferase assays 36 h after transfection .
All transfections were performed in duplicate .
Cell lysates were assayed by using commercially available reagents ( Pro-mega ) in an LKB series 1250 luminometer .
Values presented are the averages of three experiments with similar results , unless otherwise indicated ( see figure legends ) ; variability between experimental duplicates was typically < 15 % .
Protein-DNA binding analysis .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Lee and colleagues ( 35 ) .
Briefly , 3 % 10 '' to 5 X 10 '' cells were harvested , allowed to swell on ice , and then lysed rapidly by passage through a hypodermic heedle .
The nuclear component was lysed , dialyzed against low-salt buffer , snap frozen , and stored at -80°C .
The final protein concentration of the extracts was generally 5 to 10 mg/ml .
Binding activity was detected by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) ( 22 , 26 ) , in which 10 ug of nuclear extract was mixed with 10,000 cpm of *°P-end-labeled DNA , with or without competitor DNA , at 30°C for 20 min and electropho-resed through a 4 % Tris-borate gel .
Full-length viral recombinants .
LTR recombinant virus stocks were generated by using 5 ' and 3 ' SIV half-genome clones as follows .
For each recombinant constructed , the 5 ' and 3 ' LTR elements were identical , thereby precluding 7802 DOLLARD ET AL .

the possibility of recombinational mutagenesis upon later transfection into human cells .
The full-length viruses shown in Fig .
7 were prepared as follows .
First , NAP LTR elements ( -172 through +102 ; StuI-PffMI cassette ) were substituted for the corresponding AP LTR sequences present in clone PBj-5'-1 ( 16 ) .
Second , analogous LTR recombinant versions of the 3 ' genome half-clones PBj-3'-9 and PBj-3'-b were constructed .
The LTR sequences exchanged in this fashion include the same five point mutations and the 22-bp duplication that were included in the truncated LTR-luciferase reporter constructs used in our transient transfection analyses .
For generation of infectious SIV stocks , a Bcell restriction site was used to linearize the desired 5 and 3 ' SIV genome halves , which were then ligated to one another and transfected directly into U-87MG cells by the method of Lang and colleagues ( 34 ) .
After a single round of viral replication in U-87MG cells , 5 X 10° CEMX174 cells were added for cocultivation , and virus stocks were prepared .
Virus-containing supernatants were titrated by serial dilution in CEMX174 cells , and the 50 % tissue culture infectious dose per milliliter was calculated by the method of Spearman and Kirber ( 19 ) .
Replication studies .
Equivalent amounts of viral stocks ( 50 % tissue culture infectious dose units ) were used to initiate infection of 5 x 10° CEMX 174 and C8166 cells ( multiplicity of infection [ MOI ] of 10~* ) .
Following initial infection , kinetics of viral replication were monitored by removing cell-free supernatants at 3- to 4-day intervals .
Reverse transcriptase activity in these supernatants was determined by previously described procedures ( 27 ) .
Proliferation studies .
Pig-tailed macaque PBMC were obtained by layering heparinized blood from SIV-seronegative animals over Ficoll-sodium diatrizoate density gradients ( Phar-macia ) .
Cells were then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % human AB serum ( R/HS medium ) and used immediately for proliferation studies .
Briefly , viral supernatants ( MOI of 0.003 ) , mitogen ( 1 % PHA plus 5 % IL-2 ) , or medium alone was added to 10° PBMC in R/HS medium in triplicate , and cells were incubated for 6 days at 37°C in 5 % CO , .
On day 6 , each well was pulsed for 16 h with 1 wCi of [ °H ] thymidine , and the radioactivity incorporated into cellular DNA was quantitated .
RESULTS Elevated basal transcriptional activity of the AP LTR from SIVimmppji4 We constructed LTR-luciferase reporter plasmids in which either intact ( -560 to +321 ) or truncated ( -172 to +321 ) SIV LTR sequences from AP or NAP viral clones were inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene ( Fig .
1 ) .
These constructs were then transfected transiently into a variety of cell lines , and luciferase activity was determined .
Initial experiments confirmed reports that upstream SIV LTR elements are dispensable for near normal levels of basal , mitogen-enhanced , or Tat-transactivated LTR transcription ( 2 , 3 , 55 ) ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , all subsequent analyses were performed with the truncated LTR reporter constructs .
The AP and NAP LTR sequences contained in these reporter constructs ( -172 to +321 ) differ by only five point mutations and a 22-bp duplication ( Fig .
1B ) .
In addition , a third LTR clone , designated NAP-M , was constructed and tested .
This clone is identical to the NAP LTR except that it contains the 22-bp duplication from the AP LTR .

Basal LTR activity .
The indicated cell lines and primary human PBMC were transiently transfected with AP and NAP luciferase plasmids .
The values of all NAP LTR transfections were normalized to 1 , so as to account for variations in transfection efficiency between different cells .
The fold increase in luciferase activity of the AP LTR compared with the NAP LTR in each cell type is noted .
Values presented are the averages of two or three experiments performed in duplicate with similar results .
The standard error of mean values are marked by bars for experiments that were performed three times ; error bars are not shown for experiments performed only twice ( ChM114 , Si-IHA , and U937 ) .
Basal LTR-directed luciferase activity was measured in cell lines of T-cell , non-T-cell , human , and simian lineage , as well as in primary human PBMC .
The LTR from the AP strain was consistently more active than the LTR from the NAP strain ( Fig .
2 ) , while the NAP-M construct had basal activity that was only very slightly less than that of the AP LTR ( Fig .
3 ) .
The difference in transcriptional activity ranged from 2- to 4.5-fold , depending on the cell type , but there was no evidence of either species or tissue specificity .
Effect of cytokine and phorbol ester on transcription .
To assess whether LTR mutations result in different levels of responsiveness to cellular stimulation , LTR-luciferase constructs were transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells , which were then treated with PMA or TNF- « prior to determination of luciferase activity .
PMA and TNF-a both activate NFB ( 20 , 42 , 47 , 50 ) ; however , PMA is a less specific activator of NFB since it also regulates a variety of other cellular transcription factors , including AP-1 and the c-ets gene products ( 28 , 36 , 65 , 66 ) .
In these experiments , differences in basal transcription between the LTRs were considerably enhanced under conditions of cellular stimulation .
The SIV LTRs were stimulated 2.2- to 7.8-fold over basal levels by PMA and 1.9- to 3.6-fold over basal levels by TNF-a ( Fig .
3 ) .
This level of stimulation is slightly less than that observed when an HIV-1 LTR reporter construct was used ( this clone was derived by subcloning LTR sequences from pNL432 into pXP1 ) .
The HIV-1 LTR was stimulated 10.6-fold or 5.5-fold over basal levels when cells were treated with PMA or TNF-a , respectively ( data not shown ) .
In all cases , however , transcription from the AP SIV LTR was preferentially activated by cellular stimulation , by approximately two- to threefold relative to the NAP LTR ( Fig .
3 ) .
Furthermore , the NAP-M LTR exhibited transcriptional properties quite similar to those of the AP LTR under conditions of cellular stimulation and in fact exhibited an enhanced responsiveness to PMA treatment relative to the AP LTR ( Fig .
3 ) .
These findings suggest strongly that the 22-bp sequence duplication confers both increased basal transcrip- CONTRIBUTION OF NFkB TO PHENOTYPE OF $ IVinmppia _ 7803 mam ArUTR ESS NAP-M LTR CCJ ] NAPLTR 34X Basal 2.TX m 52X PMA | 78X 22X p50/p6S U 0 5 10 15 20 25 Relative luciferase activity FIG .

LTR response to cellular stimulation and NFkB .
Jurkat cells were transfected with the AP , NAP , or NAP-M SIV LTR-luciferase reporter plasmid ( the NAP-M clone is identical to the NAP LTR except for the inclusion of the 22-bp enhancer sequence duplication from the AP LTR ) .
Cells were then treated with PMA , TNF- « , or nothing prior to enzyme assays as described in Materials and Methods .
In addition , some cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for the Rel family proteins p50 and p65 ( RelA ) , which together comprise NFkB ( p50-p65 ) .
Numbers shown correspond to either the fold increase in luciferase activity relative to the unstimulated NAP LTR ( Basal ) or to the fold stimulation over the uninduced level of luciferase activity for each of the LTRs tested ( PMA , TNFa , and p50/p65 ) .
Values shown are the averages of three experiments performed in duplicate with similar results ; the standard error of mean values are marked by bars .
tional activity and an enhanced ability to respond to cellular stimuli .
The data obtained with PMA and TNF-a were confirmed by additional studies using expression plasmids encoding the Rel family proteins p50 and p65 ( RelA ) , which together comprise NF « B ( p50-p65 heterodimer [ 58 ] ) .
When p50 and p65 expression vectors were cotransfected into Jurkat cells along with the LTR-luciferase reporter constructs , there was a 6.2- to 22-fold induction of LTR activity for the SIV LTRs and a 16.7-fold induction of the HIV-1 LTR activity .
Once again , the AP SIV LTR was preferentially activated , by approximately threefold relative to the NAP LTR ( Fig .
3 ) .
The NAP-M LTR behaved similarly to the AP LTR , although it was activated somewhat less efficiently by the cloned NFxB subunits p50 and p65 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Increased binding to the NFB site after treatment with phorbol ester .
The transient transfection analyses demonstrated that PMA and TNF- « treatment led to elevated transcription from both the AP and NAP SIV LTRs ( Fig .
3 ) .
EMSAs were performed to confirm that these increases in transcription were accompanied by a rise in nuclear levels of NFB .
Parallel cultures of Jurkat T cells were harvested after treatment with either PMA , TNF- « , or nothing .
EMSAs were then performed on nuclear extracts by using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide representing the 22-bp duplication found in the SIV.nmppii4 LTR ( Fig .
4A ) .
This 22-bp DNA fragment contains an NFxB binding site as well as an overlapping site for the transcription factor SF3 ( 67 ) .
To differentiate between these factors , we designed a second oligonucleotide , which contains a mutated NFxB site and a wild-type SF3 site ( Fig .
4A ) .
The wild-type and NFkB mutant oligonucleotides were then used as competitors in gel shift experiments .

EMSA .
( A ) Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the 22-bp enhancer sequence that is in tandem duplication in SIVinmppii , were synthesized .
Wild-type DNA was end labeled , and unlabeled wild-type or mutant DNAs were used for competition experiments ; the latter has been shown not to bind NFkB ( 47 ) .
Underlined sequences denote the binding site for NFB , brackets mark the SF3 binding site ( 67 ) , and mutated bases are shown in outline form .
( B ) EMSA reaction mixtures contained 10 ug of protein from nuclear extracts prepared simultaneously from PMA- or TNF- « -stimulated or unstimulated Jurkat cultures , 10,000 cpm of radiolabeled DNA , and , in some cases , unlabeled competitor DNA .
Arrows indicate NFB and ( putative ) SF3 complexes ; N.S. , a nonspecific DNA-protein complex that was not competed for by unlabeled DNA .
Lane 1 contains no nuclear extract ; lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 have no competitor ; lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 have a 25-fold molar excess of wild-type ( W ) competitor ; lanes 4 , 7 , and 10 have a 25-fold molar excess of mutant ( M ) competitor .
In PMA- and TNF-o-stimulated cultures , two shifted bands were observed ( Fig .
4B ) .
The lower band had the same mobility as a band that was detected in unstimulated cultures and was competed for by both the wild-type and NFkB mutant oligonucleotides .
The upper band was detected only in nuclear extracts from stimulated cells and was competed for with wild-type DNA but not with NFkB mutant DNA .
Thus , it seems likely that the lower band corresponds to the constitutive transcription factor SF3 , while the upper band represents NFkB binding activity ( Fig .
4B ) .
It is intriguing that the putative SF3 binding activity appears to be induced in Jurkat cells by TNF- « treatment but not by PMA .
EMSA analysis using nuclear extracts from SW480 and J-Jahn cells suggest that the basal levels of this factor may also vary between different cells ( data not shown ) .
Transactivation by viral Tat .
Tat-coding sequences from both AP and NAP clones of SIV ... .ps ; 1 , were cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector to examine whether there is a difference in the extent of transactivation mediated by the two SIV Tat proteins .
A second goal of these experiments was to determine whether there was any difference in the responses of the AP and NAP LTRs to Tat-mediated transactivation , as was described for the LTRs from SIV , ,4c142 aDd SIV DY Anderson and Clements ( 3 ) .

LTR transactivation by SIV Tat .
Human T cells ( Jurkat ) were transiently transfected with the AP and NAP LTR luciferase plasmids and either the AP or NAP Tat expression vector or the vector with no insert ( pUC19 ) .
The luciferase activity values for the NAP LTR were normalized to 1 in all experiments ; other datum points are expressed as multiples of this .
Numbers shown correspond to the fold stimulation over the uninduced level of luciferase activity for each of the LTR-Tat combinations tested .

kat cells together with one of the Tat expression plasmids or with the pUC19 vector .
The two SIV Tat protein expression vectors conferred essentially indistinguishable levels of transactivation on the SIV LTR reporter constructs , and the two LTRs were equally Tat responsive , despite the presence of a point mutation at residue +83 in the AP LTR ( Fig .
5 ) .
Enhancer activity of the 22-bp LTR repeat .
To determine whether the duplicated LTR sequences in SIV.nnpp ; i , have intrinsic enhancer activity , oligonucleotides similar to those used in EMSA experiments ( Fig .
4A ) were cloned into the pSlucZ2 luciferase reporter plasmid ( 48 ) .
This plasmid contains an enhancerless SV40 promoter which has multiple Sp1 binding sites , like the SIV LTR .
Both one and two copies of the 22-bp LTR repeat from SIV were cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter in both wild-type and NFkB mutant versions .
The constructs were then transfected into SW480 cells , and luciferase assays were performed .
A single copy of the 22-bp LTR sequence , either wild type or NFB mutant , had transcriptional activity approximately fivefold higher than that of the vector alone ( Fig .
6 ) .
Presumably , the modest enhancer activity from these single-copy clones reflects SF3-mediated transcriptional enhancement , since the SF3 binding motif is intact in both the wild-type and NFkB mutant oligonucleotides .
When two copies of the 22-bp SIV inmppji4 LTR motif were placed upstream of the SV40 promoter , an increase in the level of transcriptional enhancement was detected ( approximately fivefold higher than for the single-copy clone ; compare pWR1 and pWR2 in Fig .
6 ) .
This additional increase in transcriptional activity was completely abolished , however , when the NFB binding site was mutated ( compare pMR1 and pMR2 in Fig .
6 ) .
Replication of LTR recombinant SIVs in continuous cell lines .
We constructed two pairs of SIVs that were isogenic except for their LTR elements ( -172 through +102 ) .
These virus pairs were designed to allow us to test the effects of LTR mutations in the context of env ( and accessory ) genes from both AP and NAP derivatives Of SIV.nmppiia ( Fig .
7 ) .
The LTR sequences that were exchanged in these SIV recombi-nants were carefully chosen so as to include all of the differences between the NAP and AP LTRs in the US , R , and promoter-proximal half of U3 ( there are no differences between these LTRs in the region +102 through +321 ) .
Thus , the full-length SIVs were designed to allow comparison of the VoL .

Clones pMR1 and pMR2 contain one and two copies , respectively , of a derivative of this sequence in which the NFxB site ( s ) has been mutated so as to abolish its function ( GGG-CTC ) , while the adjacent SF3 site ( s ) has been left intact ( see Fig .

biologic effects of the same LTR mutations that were previously compared in our truncated LTR-luciferase reporter constructs ( these contain LTR sequences from -172 through +321 ) .
Infectious SIVs were generated by transfection of ligated SIV genome halves into U-87MG cells , followed by cocultiva-tion with CEMX174 cells to generate virus stocks .
SIV stocks were then used to infect the SIV-susceptible lymphoid cell lines CEM X 174 ( a B-cell/T-cell hybrid ) and C8166 ( an HTLV-I-transformed T cell ) at an MOI of 10~* .
In CEMX174 cells ( Fig .
8A ) , all four recombinant SIVs replicated to similar levels at later time points ( days 18 through 25 ) .
However , at early time points ( day 10 ) , there was a significant increase in replication by the two SIVs which contained the AP LTR elements ( DEW-1 and DEW-3 ) compared with their otherwise isogenic counterparts ( DEW-2 and DEW-4 , respectively ) .
Similar results were obtained for C8166 cells ( Fig .
8B ) .
In these cells , however , 3 ' genome half sequences from NAP virus clones conferred a significant growth advantage ( compare clones DEW-3 and DEW-4 with clones DEW-1 and DEW-2 ) .
This difference presumably reflects an alteration in virus cell tropism , mostly likely due to differences in the env gene .
Ability of LTR recombinant SIVs to trigger proliferation in resting cells .
The ability of SIV ; ... ..pg ; 1 4 , and molecular clones derived from it , to induce proliferation in resting PBMC from LTR 5 ( ga ; CONTRIBUTION OF NFkB TO PHENOTYPE OF $ IVimmppia - 7805 pig-tailed macaques is unique among SIVs and is a highly predictive correlate of acute pathogenicity in vivo ( 24 , 49 ) .
Infection of resting pig-tailed macaque PBMC with the recombinant SIVs was therefore performed , and cellular proliferation was measured at 6 days after infection by the method of Novembre et al .
( 49 ) .
Two of the four recombinant SIVs tested , DEW-1 and DEW-2 , induced cellular proliferation ( Fig .
9 ) .
These contain both gag and env elements from AP clones of SIV.nappii , whereas clones DEW-3 and DEW-4 lack the AP env elements previously shown to be necessary for the induction of cellular proliferation ( 49 ) .
Interestingly , we also observed that DEW-1 induced a level of cellular proliferation two- to threefold higher than than produced by the DEW-2 virus .
This finding indicates that AP LTR elements can significantly enhance an important phenotypic property of SI ‘ 1smmPBj 14° DISCUSSION We previously reported isolation and sequence analysis of a variant of SIV referred to as SIV . , ... pp ; 1 , that is unlike any all other primate lentiviruses in causing acute disease and death 1 to 2 weeks postinfection ( 25 ) .
One of the most striking genetic differences between and other viruses belonging to the SIV , , , , , , HIV-2 group is in the LTR enhancer element ; SIV : mmppii1 has a tandem sequence duplication that contains a binding site for transcription factor NFkB ( 12 , 16 , 17 , 49 ) .
Studies of other molecular clones of SIV have determined that the viral determinants of acute disease induction map to multiple genetic loci , including the env and gag genes ( 49 ) .
These findings are analogous to those for the feline leukemia virus model for AIDS , in which viral determinants of pathogenicity were also mapped to several gene segments , including the env gene and the LTR ( 18 ) .
Because SIV immppji4 has unique replicative properties , it was important to define precisely the effects that the two NFkB sites had on the functional activity of this virus 's LTR .
We show here that the basal transcriptional activity of an LTR derived from an AP molecular clone Of $ IVimmppji1a iS higher than that of a prototype SIV. , , , , , , LTR , derived from an NAP virus stock .
These LTRs differ by only five point muta-tions , four of which map to the LTR enhancer , as well as a 22-bp sequence duplication that contains an NFB binding site .
Basal transcription from the AP SIV LTR was consistently 2- to 4.5-fold higher than that from the NAP LTR , regardless of cell type or species of origin .
This difference was found in primary cells ( human PBMC ) as well as in cell lines .
Furthermore , the increased level of basal transcription was shown to be due in large part to the 22-bp enhancer sequence duplica-tion , since addition of this element to the NAP LTR resulted 3 ' ( env ) LTR mp > ev Comme ) - > a Parent NAP clone ym ~~~ W > asin FIG .

Replication kinetics of recombinant SIVs .
Human lymphoid cell lines ( CEM x 174 and C8166 ) were infected with recombinant SIVs at an MOI of 10~* , and reverse transcriptase assays were performed on cell-free culture supernatants at timed intervals thereafter .
The filled symbols represent viruses with AP LTR elements ( DEW-1 [ M ) and DEW-3 [ a ] ) , while the corresponding open symbols represent isogenic viruses with NAP LTRs ( DEW-2 [ 0 ] and DEW-4 [ + ] ) .
Dark lines are used to further distinguish the DEW-1/DEW-2 virus pair from the DEW-3/DEW-4 virus pair ( lighter lines ) .
The open circles represent negative control cultures ( no virus added ) .
Data shown are mean reverse transcriptase data for three ( CEM or two ( C8166 ) experiments with similar results .
in a clone ( NAP-M ) with basal transcriptional activity that was only slightly less than that of the AP LTR .
Experiments designed to test the effect of cellular stimulation on SIV LTR-directed transcription showed that when cells were treated with PMA or TNF-a , or when they were cotransfected with p50/p65 NFB subunit expression vectors , there was a significant rise in LTR transcription relative to basal levels .
The AP LTR was induced to a greater ( two- to threefold ) extent than the NAP LTR by all of these treatments .
We determined whether the duplicated enhancer element in the AP LTR from was required for responsiveness to cellular stimulation by using the NAP-M LTR clone .
This clone was induced to a somewhat higher level by PMA than either of the parental LTRs , while its responsiveness to the cloned NFB subunits p50 and p65 was slightly reduced relative to the AP LTR .
The minor difference in PMA responsiveness may reflect the binding of PMA-induced factors , such as the Elf-1 protein ( 36 ) , to the putative PuB2 element ( AGGAA consensus motif ) in the NAP LTR , since this element is absent in the AP LTR ( Fig .
1 ) .
The fact that the AP and NAP-M LTRs responded almost equally to TNF-a , but not to the cloned NFkB subunits p65 and p50 , was somewhat unexpected .
Presumably , this reflects ( i ) an interaction between NFB subunits p65 and p50 and an unknown cellular factor which binds preferentially to either the NAP or AP LTR and ( ii ) the fact that TNF- « activates several NFkB proteins in addition to p65 and p50 ( 6 ) .
We also performed parallel studies in which the transcriptional properties of the duplicated 22-bp LTR sequence from the AP LTR from SIV ; ..pg ; i , were analyzed .
These included experiments designed to differentiate the relative contributions of the two overlapping transcription factor binding sites ( SF3 and NFxB ) contained within the 22-bp DNA fragment .
Two copies of the 22-bp LTR element had significantly ( fivefold ) elevated transcription-enhancing activity , when placed upstream of an enhancerless promoter , relative to a single copy of the same element .
This level of enhancement is very similar to the difference in basal transcriptional activity from the intact AP and NAP SIV LTRs .
These studies also showed that two copies of the NFB binding site are absolutely required for enhancement of transcription , since enhancement was abolished upon mutation of the NFB binding sites .
The more-than-additive transcriptional effect of the 22-bp enhancer duplication may result from one of several mechanisms .
These include synergistic interactions between bound NFB proteins and other components of a single transcription complex , including other transcription factors such as SF3 ( 67 ) or Spil ( 52 , 61 ) , which is present both in the SV40 promoter used in these experiments and in the native SIV LTR .
Alternatively , there may be kinetic synergism between NFkB complexes bound to the two tandem NFB sites ( 29 ) or cooperative DNA binding by some NFB proteins ( 52 ) .
It is also interesting that binding of the constitutive transcription factor SF3 alone can provide a considerable level of transcriptional enhancement in T cells ( fivefold greater than Neg .

Induction of cellular proliferation by recombinant SIVs .
Quiescent pig-tailed macaque PBMC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium without PHA or IL-2 , and human AB serum was substituted for fetal bovine serum .
Cells were then infected with recombinant SIVs , and cellular proliferation was quantitated as described in Materials and Methods .

This finding might help to explain why derivatives of SIV that contained a mutated NFB LTR but an intact SF3 site replicated to normal levels in T cells ( 7 ) .
Overall , the transcriptional data presented here suggest that NFkB plays a significant role in both basal and cytokine/ mitogen-inducible transcription from the SIV .inqmpy ; 14 LTR .
Transient transfection analyses do not , however , always reveal the effects of LTR mutations when they are introduced into intact clones of HIV-1 or SIV ( 7 , 38 ) .
Two pairs of recombinant SIVs , which were isogenic except for LTR elements from -172 to +102 , were constructed .
These permitted a comparison of the phenotypic properties conferred on intact SIVs by the same five LTR point mutations and 22-bp duplication that were contained in our LTR-luciferase reporter constructs .
Molecular clones DEW-1 and DEW-3 contain AP LTR sequences , whereas clones DEW-2 and DEW-4 contain NAP LTRs .
These LTRs were paired with different 3 ' genome halves ( i.e. , env and accessory genes ) in DEW-1 and DEW-2 versus DEW-3 and DEW-4 to determine whether the biologic properties conferred by LTR elements were influenced by other SIV genetic determinants .
Replication studies using these recombinant SIVs revealed that LTR sequences do in fact influence viral replication in continuous cell lines .
Inclusion of AP LTR sequences in otherwise isogenic SIVs consistently resulted in faster kinetics of virus replication in continuous cell lines , although final levels of virus production were not affected .
We also determined the ability of each of these viruses to trigger proliferation of resting simian PBMC in vitro .
This property has consistently proved to be the most reliable in vitro correlate of acute disease induction in vivo ( 24 , 49 ) , and viral genetic determinants in both gag and env are required for induction of proliferation ( 49 ) .
Our studies confirmed that 3 ' genome half sequences ( presumably env ) are indeed crucial for the induction of cellular proliferation by SIV ; , ,..pg ; 14 .
Furthermore , our data showed that SIVs containing AP LTR elements were significantly ( two- to threefold ) more efficient inducers of cellular proliferation compared with viruses containing NAP LTR elements .
These findings demonstrate that LTR elements can strongly influence a crucial biologic property of SIV smmpBj10 possibly as a result of increasing the kinetics of virus replication during the initial phase of infection .
On the basis of these data , we propose that the viral determinants of pathogenesis for individual strains of SIV and HIV-1 may be multifactorial and reflect coevolution at multiple genetic loci .
Thus , LTR mutations in SIVgnmppii4 MY reflect an adaptation that allows the virus to more efficiently exploit cellular responses to the elevated cytokine levels that occur during acute immunodeficiency virus infection .
A better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of SIV and HIV-1 may provide important insights into possible strategies to control viral infection and disease .
For example , antioxi-dants , antitranscriptional drugs , and antagonists of NFkB activation might prove effective in limiting the initial spread of HIV-1 as well as the reactivation of latent proviruses ( 10 , 43 , 56 , 60 ) .
