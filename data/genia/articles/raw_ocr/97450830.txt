F. ] Abstract We have identified a novel gene , GR6 , located within the leukemia breakpoint region of 3q21 , that is normally expressed in early fetal development but not in adult peripheral blood .
GR6 is activated in the UCSD-AML1 cell line and in a leukemic sample , both of which carry a t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) .
In UCSD-AML1I , we have also identified fusion transcripts between the ecotropic viral insertion site I ( EVZZ ) gene in 3q26 and GR6 and between EVI1 and Ribophorin I that maps 30 kb telomeric to GR6 in 3q21 .
All fusions splice the 5 ' ends of the 3q21 genes into exon 2 of the EVI1 gene , an event that is similar to the normal intergenic splicing of MDS1-EVI1 and to those previously documented in leukemias with t ( 3 ; 21 ) and t ( 3 ; 12 ) , in which acute myelogenous leukemia 1-EVI1 fusions and ETV6-EVI1 fusions , respectively , occur .
The Ribophorin I-EVIl fusion in particular may be a common occurrence in t ( 3 ; 3 ) .
Introduction The involvement of 3q21 and 3q26 in rearrangements in leukemia is well established ( 1 ) .
Translocations , inversions , and deletions in and between 3q21 and 3q26 are seen in 4-6 % of AML s* and also in some chronic myelogenous leukemias , therapy-related leukemias , and MDSs .
In many of these cases , the zinc finger transcription factor , the EVIL gene , which maps to 3q26 , has been shown to be aberrantly activated ( 2-5 ) .
Breakpoints within 3q26 that can effect this activation have been mapped over large regions , up to several hundred kb either 5 ' or 3 ' to EVIL .
Regulation of expression of the EVI !
gene appears complicated .
In normal tissues , EVZZ and a gene of unknown function , MDS1 , located 170-300 kb upstream , have been shown to exist both as separate transcripts and as spliced products , where the 5 ' end of MDSI1 is spliced into exon 2 of EVI !
( 6 ) .
Because exon 2 of EVI !
is otherwise not translated , this intergenic splicing produces a radically different 5 ' protein sequence .
The complexities of the MDSI/EVII gene organization and regulation in 3q26 have not been reported for other human genes .
In contrast to 3q26 , the precise role of sequences in 3q21 is less well described .
Breakpoints here are clustered ; the 10 that have been mapped are located within a segment no more than 30 kb in size ( 7-9 ) .
The RBPH1 gene maps 20 kb telomeric to this region , an observation that has led to the hypothesis that an associated enhancer is responsible for the activation of EVI1 ( 7 ) .
However , several additional transcriptional units have been described within an 80-kb segment , Received 6/10/97 ; accepted 7/28/97 .

immediately proximal to RBPH ! T and spanning the breakpoint region ( 9 ) .
These putative genes are novel , of unknown function , and generally expressed at low levels in normal tissues .
The density of genes and the dispersion of breakpoints suggests that leukemia rearrangements may make a number of different transcriptional alterations possible .
Here , we describe several of these alterations in t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) , seen in the leukemia-derived cell line , UCSD-AML1 ( 10 ) , and in a leukemia sample .
A novel gene , GR6 , within 3q21 , has been characterized and shown to be normally expressed in early fetus but not in adult lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid cells .
GR6 is , however , activated in the leukemia-derived cell line , UCSD-AML1 , and in the one additional leukemic sample tested .
In addition , GR6 and RBPH1 separately participate in intergenic splicing events with the EVZZ gene in the UCSD-AML1 cell line .
From information on the locations of other leukemic breakpoints in 3q21 , the occurrence of at least the RBPH1-EVI1-spliced product may be a common event in t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) .
Materials and Methods Cell Lines .
The leukemia-derived UCSD-AML1 cell line , carrying t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) , has been described previously ( 10 ) .
The lymphoblastoid cell line CGM-1 ( received from M. V. Olsen , University of Washington , Seattle ) was used as a normal control .
Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 15 % fetal bovine serum .
For the UCSD-AML1 cell line , 100 units/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor was added to the medium .
Sequence Analysis , Sequencing within the 3q21 breakpoint region has been described ( 9 ) .
Twenty-five kb of sequence , spanning 12 kb telomeric to the UCSD-AML1 breakpoint to 13 kb centromeric , has been submitted to the GenBank database ( accession no .

RACE products were electrophoresed , identified by hybridization , and cloned as above .
Results Characterization of the GR6 Gene .
A previous report described gene identification within an 80-kb segment of 3q21 , spanning a number of leukemia breakpoints ( 9 ) .
As part of this work , a 25-kb segment surrounding the breakpoint from the leukemia-derived cell line UCSD-AML1 was completely sequenced .
Analysis of this sequence using the GRAIL exon identification software predicted three exons , located approximately 1 kb telomeric to the UCSD-AML breakpoint ( Fig .
1 ) .
Sequences of the predicted exons were used to design primers for RACE and RT-PCR experiments ( described be-low ) .
Comparisons of these results with the genomic sequence deter mined exact exon boundaries and the complete structure of the gene , which we have called GR6 .
GR6 is composed of 4 exons ( Fig .
16 ) : exon 1 , of undetermined length ( RACE has not been extended further 5 ' ) , and exons 2-4 , of 121 bp , 109 bp , and 1.6 kb , respectively .
Cloning and sequencing of the following RT-PCR and RACE products determined this structure : ( a ) an 800-bp RACE product contained part of exon 1 , spliced directly to exon 4 ; ( b ) three consecutive 3 ' RACE products of 600 , 450 , and 250 bp connected the 3 ' end of the 800-bp RACE product with the poly ( A ) tail of the gene .
The 250-bp RACE product contained a 30-nucleotide poly ( A ) tail that was not encoded by the genomic sequence ; ( c ) a 1.0-kb RACE product and a 600-bp RT-PCR product contained part of exon 3 , the entire exon 3a , and part of exon 4 ; ( d ) a 300-bp RT-PCR product contained part of exon 3 , spliced directly to exon 4 ; and ( e ) a 350-bp RT-PCR product contained part of exon 1 , the entire exon 2 , plus part of exon 3 .
Together , these data suggest the existence of several alternatively spliced GR6 mRNAs ( Fig .
1 , b and c ) : an mRNA in which exon 1 is spliced directly to exon 4 ; an mRNA in which exons 3 and 4 are connected through exon 3a ; and either an mRNA in which exons 1-4 are spliced in sequence or two mRNAs , one in which exons 1-3 are spliced in sequence and one in which exons 3 and 4 are spliced in sequence ( these last two mRNAs can not be distinguished in the experiments described here ) .
All splice sites conform to the consensus GT/AG .
The RT-PCR product for the first transcript ( in which exon 1 of GR6 is spliced directly into exon 4 ) was always much more intense than the other two ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this is the major normal GR6 transcript .
This is consistent with the identification by RACE of only this transcript ( the other two were identified by RT-PCR ) .
Exon 4 contains a 450-bp ORF , with the initiation methionine at nucleotide 968 ( Fig .
1c ) .
No homologies to known genes , expressed sequence tags , or other sequences were found in Blast searches with the GR6 transcripts , with the exception of a 50-bp Alu segment within exon 2 .
All hybridizations to Northern blots containing 2 ug of poly ( A ) + RNA from a variety of fetal and adult tissues and several cancer cell lines and using RACE and RT-PCR products as probes were negative .

RT-PCR analysis was used to explore this possibility ( Fig .
10 ) .
RT-PCR using GRG6A and GRG6B primers ( within exons 1 and 4 , respectively ) was weak in normal lymphocytes and negative in a lymphoblastoid cell line ( Lanes / and 3 ) .
Results were similar with other cell lines , including both normal and tumor-derived cell lines lacking 3q21 rearrangements ( data not shown ) .
However , normal human 7-8-week embryo showed strong levels of GR6 product ( Lane 4 ) .
This is the only evidence of GR6 expression in material carrying a normal 3q21 region that we have found .
GR6 is also expressed in the UCSD-AML1 leukemia cell line ( Lane 2 ) , in which the 3q21 breakpoint lies approximately 1 kb 3 ' to GR6 .
In neither fetal tissues nor the UCSD-AML1 cell line is GRG6 expression detectable by Northern analysis .
Similar results were obtained with patient material that showed a t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q426 ) ( sample no .
32 ; Lane 5 ) .
These data indicate that breakpoints outside the GR6 gene , i.e. , the UCSD-AML1 breakpoint is 3 ' to GR6 and the sample no .
32 breakpoint is 5 ' ( see Discussion and Fig .
3 ) , can both effect aberrant activation of GR6 .
This observation is similar to that with breakpoints surrounding the EVIL gene in 3q26 .

gene in 3q26 in the UCSD-AML cell line .
This suggests that GR6 , P2 , and RBPH1 could , in principle , participate in forming intergenic fusion transcripts with EVI1 .
To explore this possibility , RT-PCR was carried out between exon 3 of the EVIZZ gene and various exons of GR6 and RBPH1 and segments of the P2 gene ( Fig .
2a ) .
Three different intergenic transcripts between EVIl and GR6 and one intergenic transcript between EVI1 and RBPH1 were identified : ( a ) IT ] fuses exon 1 of the GR6 gene with exon 2 of the EVI ] gene .
The ORF of this transcript includes 3 amino acids ( including methionine ) of exon 1 of the GR6 gene , 63 amino acids of exons 2 and 3 of the EVIL gene ( in normal EVIl transcripts this region is not translated ; Ref .
5 ) , and 1051 amino acids of the normal EVI } protein .
( b ) IT2 fuses exon 4 of the GR6 gene with exon 2 of the EVI !
gene .
An ORF of this transcript includes 63 amino acids of exon 4 of the GR6 gene ( including methionine ) and the same 1104 amino acids of the EVI !
gene as IT1 .
The 63 amino acids from the GR6 gene in this transcript are encoded by an ORF different from the major GR6 ORF .
This smaller ORF is 200 bp in size ( Fig .
Ic ) .
( c ) IT3 also fuses exon 4 of the GR6 gene with exon 2 of the EVI/ gene .
But in this case , an 87-bp exon X is located between these two exons .
The ORF of the IT3 is the same as the ORF of the IT2 , with the addition of 29 amino acids encoded by exon X. Exon X has been localized to 3q26 by analysis of a chromosome 3 hybrid mapping panel ( Ref .
8 ; data not shown ) ; it is not part of the published sequence of the EVI ] cDNA ( 17 ) , and it shows no homology to any GenBank sequences in Blast searches .
( d ) 1T4 fuses inframe exon 1 of RBPHT to exon 2 of EVII .
The ORF of IT4 contains 87 amino acids of RBPH1 fused to the same 1104 amino acids of EVI1 .
The predicted protein sequences of all four fusion proteins are shown in Fig .
2¢ .
Summary .
Because of the complexity of these data , some additional details are worth summarizing .
No intergenic fusion transcripts involving P2 or any other exons of GR6 or RBPH ! T were found , and RBPH1-GR6-EVIl tandem fusions were not seen .
Limited patient material precluded testing of sample no .
32 for any fusion transcripts .
In fusion transcripts IT2 and IT3 , it is assumed that the transcription start site is similar to that for IT 1 , i.e. , including the normal exon 1 of GR6 .
This has not been determined ; what has been described is the start of an ORF .
5° RACE from EVI1 can not help in these determinations because of the high levels of activated expression of the ( apparently ) normal EVI1 transcript ( 2 ) .
In summary , in the UCSD-AML 1 cell line , three types of relevant transcripts are seen : normal EVII transcripts produced by breakpoint activation ; normal GR6 transcripts similarly produced by breakpoint activation ; and fusion transcripts between GR6 and EVI1 and between RBPH1 and EVI !
Discussion We have identified a novel gene , GR6 , mapping within the leukemia breakpoint region of 3q21 , a band frequently associated with t ( 3 ; 3 ) , inv ( 3 ) , and del ( 3q21 ) in AML , chronic myelogenous leukemia , and MDS .
The GR6 gene is composed of four exons , with an ORF of 150 amino acids located within exon 4 .

FUSION TRANSCRIPTS WITH EVI IN LEUKEMIA centromere , and its 3 ' end lies 1 kb from the 3q21 breakpoint in the t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) seen in the leukemia-derived cell line , UCSD-AML1 .
The putative GR6 protein shows no homology with any proteins in the databases searched with Blast .
Negative Northern results with adult and 18-24-week fetal tissues suggest that GR6 expression is , at best , low in normal tissues .
GR6 does , however , show clear expression by RT-PCR in whole 7-8-week fetus , suggesting potential fetal speci-ficity .
Most interestingly , it is negative by RT-PCR in fresh adult lymphocytes but clearly expressed in the UCSD-AML1 leukemic cell line and in the one leukemic sample available for testing .
The locations and orientations of the GR6 gene , the P2 gene , and the RBPH1 gene in 3q21 , relative to the location and orientation of the EV// gene in 3q26 in the UCSD-AMLA1 cell line , suggested the possibility of fusion transcripts .
These were verified between GR6 and EVIl and between RBPH1 and EVI1 .
In each of the fusions , additional amino acids and a novel transcription start site are spliced into exon 2 of EVI1 .
The additional amino acids number 3 , 63 , and 92 from the GR6 fusions and 87 from the fusion .
Exon 2 and the 5¢ end of exon 3 of EVI1 are not translated in the EVII protein ; the novel start sites , thus , also add 63 amino acids of EVIL sequence to the translations .
Splicing into exon 2 of the EVI/Z gene is a normal event observed in pancreas and kidney , involving the 3q26 upstream MDSI gene ( 6 ) .
It is believed that this normal intergenic splicing serves to alter the transacti-vating properties of the EVI1 transcription factor , thus altering regulation of downstream genes ( 18 ) .
Abnormal £EV// exon 2 splicing events have also been observed in leukemia rearrangements involving t ( 3 ; 21 ) ( q26 ; g22 ) ( 15 ) , in which the chromosome 21 breakpoint occurs in intron 6 of the AMLI gene .
In this case , the 5 ' end of the AML !
gene is then fused either with exon 2 of EVIl directly or through MDSI or the gene encoding El A-associated protein , both upstream of EVI1 .
Similar aberrant EVI !
exon 2 splicing has also been observed in t ( 3 ; 12 ) ( q26 ; p13 ) ( 16 ) , in which the chromosome 12 breakpoint occurs within the ETV6 gene .
In a fashion analogous to the t ( 3 ; 21 ) , the first two exons of ETV6 are spliced to EVI ] or MDSI-EVI1 .
Thus , there are several examples of leukemia-associated rearrangements giving rise to potential translation of EVI !
exons 2 and 3 , suggesting that this may be a critical element in cases with EVI1 activation .
A novel feature of the 3q21-EVI1 splicing observed here is that the 3q21 breakpoint occurs downstream of the 3 ' end of each of the genes that provide the 5 ' ends of the fusion products .
Thus , it is not the more commonly observed scenario of fusion transcripts produced when a translocation has interrupted a gene .
It will be of interest to determine the sequences in 3q21 that promote these intergenic splicing events .
Unresolved is the role that the fusion protein products may play in leukemia .
These may include the inappropriate activation of EVI1 and the inappropriate function of the EVI1 protein .
This latter , at least , is strongly suggested by the analysis of normal EVI1 and MDS1/EVII function ( 18 ) .
Normal EVI !
protein is a repressor of promoters containing the AGATA motif , whereas normal MDSI/EVII is a strong activator .
In addition , the activation function of MDS1/EVII protein is contained within the segment encoded by EV/Z exons 2 and 3 .
Thus , the GRG6-EVIl and RBPH1-EVI1 fusions not only cause expression of EVI inappropriately but also potentially produce proteins with EVI1 transcriptional activator properties .
A second point of interest involves the frequency of these fusion products in leukemias with rearrangements affecting 3q21 and 3q26 .
Fig .
3 shows the breakpoint locations relative to the GR6 , RBPHT , and EVI !
genes for a number of cases in which detailed mapping information is available .
Several features are noteworthy .
First , for all cases of t ( 3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) , RBPHI-EVIl fusion can occur .
In the cases of t ( 1 ; 3 ) , RBPH1 is also correctly positioned and oriented for producing a fusion product with a gene from chromosome 1 .
In contrast , considering all t ( 3 ; 3 ) , it is possible for the GR6-EVIl fusion to occur only in the UCSD-AML1 example , and GR6 is also oriented incorrectly in both t ( 1 ; 3 ) .
Thus , it may be postulated the fusion of RBPHI1 is the critical event in leukemias with t ( 3 ; 3 ) .
The production of additional fusion products may affect some aspects of the leukemia phenotype .
Even fusions , however , are unlikely to be the entire story for 3q21 rearrangements in leukemia .
In cases of inv ( 3 ) , RBPHI1 is transcribed in the opposite orientation relative to the breakpoints and EVI !
transcription .
In these cases , the fusion partners may still be one of several novel transcripts described previously ( 9 ) or yet to be discovered in 3q21 .
