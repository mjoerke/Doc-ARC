5 ERP , a New Member of the ets Transcription Factor/Oncoprotein Family : Cloning , Characterization , and Differential Expression during B-Lymphocyte Development MONICA LOPEZ , PETER OETTGEN , YASMIN AKBARALI , ULRICH DENDORFER , AND TOWIA A. LIBERMANN* Department of Medicine , Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02215 Received 23 July 1993/Returned for modification 18 January 1994/Accepted 17 February 1994 The ets gene family encodes a group of proteins which function as transcription factors under physiological conditions and , if aberrantly expressed , can cause cellular transformation .
We have recently identified two regulatory elements in the murine immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) enhancer , # and pB , which exhibit striking similarity to binding sites for efs-related proteins .
To identify efs-related transcriptional regulators expressed in pre-B lymphocytes that may interact with either the # or the pB site , we have used a PCR approach with degenerate oligonucleotides encoding conserved sequences in all members of the ets family .
We have cloned the gene for a new ets-related transcription factor , ERP ( ets-related protein ) , from the murine pre-B cell line BASC 6C2 and from mouse lung tissue .
The ERP protein contains a region of high homology with the ETS DNA-binding domain common to all members of the ets transcription factor/oncoprotein family .
Three additional smaller regions show homology to the ELK-1 and SAP-1 genes , a subgroup of the ets gene family that interacts with the serum response factor .
Full-length ERP expresses only negligible DNA-binding activity by itself .
Removal of the carboxy terminus enables ERP to interact with a variety of efs-binding sites including the E74 site , the IgH enhancer m site , and the ick promoter ets site , suggesting a carboxy-terminal negative regulatory domain .
At least three ERP-related transcripts are expressed in a variety of tissues .
However , within the B-cell lineage , ERP is highly expressed primarily at early stages of B-lymphocyte development , and expression declines drastically upon B-cell maturation , correlating with the enhancer activity of the IgH # site .
These data suggest that ERP might play a role in B-cell development and in IgH gene regulation .
The different stages of B-cell development are characterized by differential expression of a whole set of genes , most prominently the members of the immunoglobulin gene family , as well as by differential immunoglobulin gene rearrangement ( for a review , see reference 7 ) .
Differential expression and/or activation of transcription factors leading to stage-specific expression of a certain set of genes appear to be crucial for cell differentiation in general and B-cell development in particular ( for a review , see reference 46 ) .
Transcriptional regulation of immunoglobulin genes is of special interest for B-cell differentiation , because different classes of immunoglobulin genes are switched on at different stages of B-cell development ( 7 , 83 ) .
Thus , whereas immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene expression occurs at the earliest stages of B-cell development prior to IgH gene rearrangement and continues throughout B-cell development , immunoglobulin light-chain genes are transcribed only upon maturation of B cells after IgH gene rearrangement ( 7 , 83 ) .
Analysis of the regulatory elements involved in IgH gene expression has resulted in the identification and characterization of at least three regulatory regions including the promoter upstream of the IgH gene , an intronic enhancer , and an enhancer 3 ' of the IgH gene ( 15 , 51 ) .
Several positive and negative regulatory elements appear to be distributed within these regulatory regions ( for a review , see reference 46 ) .
Most of these elements appear to be ubiquitously active ; however , some B-cell-specific regulatory elements have been described * Corresponding author .

Interestingly , each of these regulatory regions contains several , at least partially redundant B-cell-specific enhancer elements , none of them being completely essential for the regulation of the IgH gene ( 42 , 49 , 58 ) .
We have recently identified two new enhancer elements , # and pB , in the intronic IgH enhancer with characteristic functional differences ( 47 , 49 ) .
Whereas the mB element is active throughout B-cell development ( 49 ) , the # enhancer element functions primarily at early stages of B-cell development ( 47 ) .
Furthermore , whereas the wB element does not act as an enhancer by itself , m alone works as a very potent enhancer in pre-B cells ( 47 , 49 ) .
The DNA sequences of both enhancer elements show striking homology to binding sites for transcription factors of the ets transcription factor/oncoprotein family , with a GGAA sequence in the core of the binding site ( 55 , 61 , 85 , 94 ) .
All members of the ets family share a highly homologous 80- to 90-amino-acid DNA-binding domain , the ETS domain , although the remainder of the proteins are strikingly divergent among different members of the family ( for reviews , see references 55 , 61 , and 85 ) .
The ETS domain is sufficient to interact specifically with DNA sequences containing a GGA ( A/T ) in the center of the binding site ( 20 , 53 , 61 , 94 , 97 ) .
Members of the ets family have been recently shown to play essential roles as transcriptional regulators of a whole set of genes including many T-cell-specific genes such as interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) ( 88 ) , CD3 ( 40 , 88 ) , T-cell receptors « , B , and 8 ( 26 , 40 , 88 , 94 ) , human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 41 , 57 , 94 ) , stromelysin ( 96 ) , c-fos ( 14 , 25 ) , and urokinase ( 60 ) genes .
Furthermore , several ets-related genes have been shown to be expressed in B cells ( 19 , 31 , 72 ) .
As a first step in identifying putative novel members of the Vor .
14 , 1994 ets gene family which are expressed in pre-B cells , we have applied a PCR approach using degenerate oligonucleotides encoding conserved domains of all known members of the ets family and mRNA derived from a pre-B-cell line .
We now report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding a novel member of the ets gene family , named ERP ( ets-related protein ) .
The ERP gene is most closely related to SAP-1 ( 14 ) and ELK-1 ( 68 ) , two members of the ets gene family that interact with the serum response factor ( SRF ) ( 14 , 25 ) .
ERP mRNA is expressed to different extents in a variety of tissues but , in B cells , is much more abundant at the pre-B-cell stage than at later stages of B-cell development .
We demonstrate that carboxy terminus-deleted ERP interacts with several ets-related binding sites including the E74 and the IgH T sites , suggesting a potential role in IgH gene expression .

RESULTS Isolation and characterization of the murine ets-related eDNA , ERP .
Isolation of several genes related to the gene has recently led to the characterization of a novel DNA-binding motif , the ETS domain , which is highly conserved among all members of the ets family ( for reviews , see references 55 , 61 , and 85 ) .
Sequence comparison of the 80- to 85-amino-acid ETS domains of the different members of the ets family revealed several regions of high homology between all ets-related proteins .
Of these , two particular highly conserved regions , as outlined in Fig .
1A , appeared to be suitable for designing degenerate oligonucleotides which would encode all genes of the ets family that had been cloned at that time and which could be used for PCR amplification of ets-related genes from pre-B cells .
The sequence ( W/Y ) QFLL ( E/D/Q ) defined the 5 ' border of the region of cDNA to be amplified , and the sequence ( K/N ) MN ( Y/T ) ( D/E/Q ) K defined the 3 ' border .
The amplified product between these two sequences was expected to be 170 to 180 bp long including 21 bp derived from the flanking No # I and Sail restriction sites .
To identify members of diverse subfamilies of the ets family which differ in one or two amino acids , we generated two different sets of each degenerate oligonucleotide primer .
The sequences of the primers were based upon the DNA sequences encoding the two consensus amino acid sequences and differed in the codons for one amino acid as indicated in Fig .
1B .
The oligonucleotide primers were thus mixtures of 512 different oligonucleotides for primer A , 1,024 oligonucleotides for primer B , 128 oligonucleotides for primer C , and 256 oligonucleotides for primer D. The predicted thermal denaturation range of primers A and B was 42 to 54°C , and that of primers C and D was 38 to 46°C .
To ensure hybridization and extension in early amplification cycles , when only the amino acid-encoding nucleotides hybridize , and to increase specificity later on , we annealed the primers at 32°C for two cycles and then increased the annealing temperature to 55°C for the remaining cycles .
PCRs were performed with random hexamer-primed cDNA derived from the murine pre-B-cell line BASC6C2 ( 27 ) .
This strategy enabled us to obtain one predominant ethidium bromide-stained amplifica- Vor .

remaining clone did not show any sequence homology to ets-related genes and might represent a PCR artifact .
Two clones were identical to Ets-1 ( 99 ) , and two clones corresponded to the Ets-2 gene ( 99 ) .
However , 10 clones encoded the same apparently novel ets-related protein with the highest homology to ELK-1 ( 68 ) and SAP-1 ( 14 ) , a subgroup of the ets family ( see Fig .
4 and 5 ) .
Since both ELK-1 and SAP-1 sequences were derived from the human gene , whereas our gene was of murine origin , we had to make sure that our gene was indeed a new gene and not the murine counterpart of ELK-1 or SAP-1 .
We designed two additional degenerate oligonucleotide primers ( Fig .
2 ) based on conserved regions A and C present in both ELK-1 and SAP-1 ( 14 ) .
PCR amplification using primers E and F and cDNA derived from BASC6C2 cells resulted in a ~900-bp amplification product .
Upon sequencing , this 900-bp DNA fragment gave us a predicted open reading frame which confirmed the similarity to ELK-1 and SAP-1 in regions A to C as well as the striking divergence from ELK-1 and SAP-1 in the remainder of the cDNA ( Fig .
2 ) ( see Fig .
4 ) .
On the basis of the relatedness of our gene to the ets family , we named it ERP ( ets-related protein ) .
To determine the 5 ' end of ERP , we performed the 5 ' RACE method as described in Materials and Methods using primer G close to the 5 ' end of our cDNA for priming and primer H further 5 of primer G together with an oligo ( dG ) anchor primer for PCR amplification .
We obtained several 5 cDNA clones which upon sequencing were found to lie within 200 bp from each other , suggesting the possibility of multiple transcription start sites ( Fig .

Comparison of the amino acid sequence of ERP with those of SAP-1 and ELK-1 .
The optimal alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of ERP , SAP-1 ( 14 ) , and ELK-1 ( 68 ) , using the Seqapp and Clustal programs , is shown .
The four major homology regions-the ETS domain ( domain A ) and domains B to D-are boxed .
Regions of amino acid identity with ERP are shaded .
open reading frame .
The other clones between 900 bp and 1.3 kb in length contained overlapping portions of either the 3 ' end or the 5 ' end of the ERP cDNA .
Interestingly , when the sequence of the lung ERP cDNA was compared with the BASC6C2 pre-B-cell line ERP cDNA , two nucleotide differences ( C-466-T-466 and C-469-T-469 ) were observed without resulting in a change of the encoded amino acids .
This suggests a polymorphism for these two nucleotides in the murine ERP gene rather than a PCR artifact , since sequencing of several independent PCR amplification products resulted in the same sequence .
The combined length of the cDNA clones equaled 2,211 bp ( Fig .
3 ) .
Predicted amino acid sequence of ERP .
Both strands of the 2.2-kb ERP cDNA were sequenced entirely by double-stranded dideoxy sequencing using M13 sequencing primers , T7 and T3 polymerase sequencing primers , and ERP-specific primers based on partial DNA sequencing ( Fig .
3 ) .
Sequence analysis of the ERP cDNA revealed a 1,227-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a 409-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 44.5 kDa ( Fig .
3 ) , starting with an ATG at position 302 and terminating with a TGA at position 1529 .
The ATG initiator codon partially conforms to the consensus eukaryotic translation initiation sequence ( 33 ) with a G at position +4 and a G at position -3 .
There are several reasons to believe that this ATG is the translation initiation codon .
No additional ATG is found in frame , and an in-frame termination codon is found 228 bp upstream of the ATG .
Furthermore , when ERP is compared with ELK-1 and SAP-1 ( Fig .
4 ) , all three contain the initiator methionine at the same position , indicating that this ATG is the true translation initiation site .
In addition , deletion of all the sequences upstream of the ATG does not alter the size of the protein product , when the product is translated in vitro ( 62 ) .
However , we can not exclude the possibility that translation of ERP starts at a codon different from ATG .
The ERP cDNA contains a long poly ( A ) tract starting at position 2211 ( Fig .
3 ) which is preceded by a classical polyadenylation site ( Fig .
3 ) at an appropriate distance .
Three ATTTA motifs ( Fig .
3 ) , thought to be involved in rapid mRNA turnover ( 1 , 73 , 82 ) , are found in the 3 ' untranslated region , suggesting a low stability of ERP mRNA .
A hydropathicity plot of the predicted amino acid sequence reveals a hydrophobic amino terminus ( ~15 amino acids ) followed by a ~285-amino-acid primarily hydrophilic domain and a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain of ~110 amino acids .
The deduced amino acid sequence of ERP predicts a protein rich in proline ( 9 % ) , serine ( 16 % ) , leucine ( 14 % ) , and lysine ( 7 % ) .
The middle of ERP , spanning from around amino acid 200 down to around amino acid 250 , is characterized by the high abundance of alanine and serine residues ( Fig .
3 ) .
Of 57 amino acids , 21 ( 37 % ) represent serine and 11 ( 19 % ) represent alanine .
Interestingly , a cluster of five alanines is found in amino acids 208 to 212 .
Similarly , the serines appear to form short clusters .
In contrast to the amino-terminal half , which contains most of the basic and acidic amino acids , the carboxy-terminal half contains very few acidic or basic amino acid residues but is proline rich , with 27 ( 17 % ) prolines out of 163 amino acids .
Serine- and proline-rich domains have been observed in a variety of transcription factors and have been implicated previously in transactivation ( 67 , 84 , 101 ) .

A potential nuclear localization sequence , KGKKPK , is located between amino acids 292 and 297 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Several potential glycosylation sites , NKTN , NKTD , and NLSS , as well as seven putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites , five casein kinase II phosphorylation sites , a edc2 kinase phosphorylation site , and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site are present in ERP ( 29 , 35 , 81 , 92 ) .
The predicted ERP protein sequence reveals , furthermore , 15 potential mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase phosphorylation sites ( S/TP ) , two of them containing the optimal PX ( S/T ) P sequence ( 3 , 81 ) .
Several of the putative MAP kinase phosphorylation sites are present in ELK-1 and SAP-1 as well ( 14 , 56 , 68 ) .
The importance of MAP kinase phosphorylation sites for the biological function of ELK-1 has recently been demonstrated ( 56 ) , suggesting that at least some of these putative sites might be functionally relevant for ERP as well .
We observed also that the antisense DNA strand to ERP contains another 209-amino-acid open reading frame ( data not shown ) .
No homology to any known protein was found when the data base was searched for this potential protein .
We have no evidence as to whether the complementary DNA strand is indeed transcribed .
Sequence comparison of ERP with other members of the ets family .
Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of ERP with other members of the ets family revealed the highest homology to SAP-1 ( 14 ) and ELK-1 ( 68 ) , a subgroup of the ets family ( Fig .
4 and 5 ) .
Overall , the amino acid homology of ERP with SAP-1 is 46 % , and that of ERP with ELK-1 is 36 % .
Homologies are clustered in three primary regions , the amino-terminal domain A , a smaller domain B slightly further down-stream , and domain C close to the carboxy terminus .
An additional short stretch of homology , domain D , contains potential nuclear localization sequences of these proteins .
All three proteins apparently start at the same methionine , with the highly conserved ETS domain ( domain A ) directly at the amino terminus .
Spacing between regions A and B , as well as between regions B and C , appears not to be conserved .
The regions in between the conserved domains show only limited homology to each other .
Alignment of the ETS domain of ERP with that of other members of the ets family revealed highest homology to SAP-1 ( 81 % ) and ELK-1 ( 78 % ) ( Fig .
5 ) .
Sequence identity to most other members of the ets family was ~60 % .
ERP is least related to Pu.l/Spi-1 ( 39 % ) ( 31 ) and Spi-B ( 36 % ) ( 72 ) .
Homology to other members of the ets family is restricted to the ETS domain which is involved in sequence-specific DNA binding ( Fig .
5 ) .
However , short stretches of similarity between ERP and E74A or E74B ( 11 ) exist in the alanine-serine-rich region of ERP , which is divergent from ELK-1 and SAP-1 ( data not shown ) , as well as between ERP and Ets-1 ( 99 ) in a region homologous to SAP-1 ( data not shown ) .
Expression pattern of ERP in murine tissues .
To determine the expression pattern of ERP and the sizes of the ERP transcripts , poly ( A ) * mRNAs derived from various mouse tissues were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using ERP cDNA as a probe .
To control for RNA quality and quantity , we rehybridized the Northern blots with a B-actin probe .
The results indicate the presence of at least three predominant transcripts of approximately 4.4 , 2.2 , and 1.9 kb and a minor transcript of 5.9 kb ( Fig .
6 ) .
We found that the ERP gene was expressed in all tissues tested with significant variation in abundance .
Lung , spleen , and heart tissues expressed the largest amounts of ERP .
Moderate levels of ERP were found in kidney and skeletal muscle .
Very low levels of ERP mRNA were observed in brain , liver , and testis tissues .
The 5.9-kb transcript was observed only in mRNA derived from the heart .
The 4.4- and 2.2-kb transcripts were expressed in all tissues in approximately equ1valent amounts .
The results suggest that ERP is expressed to various degrees in many tissues .
Our cDNA appears to be derived from the 2.2-kb transcript .
The different transcripts might be due to either 3300 LOPEZ ET AL .

alternative splicing , cross-hybridization with transcripts derived from related genes , or transcription from the DNA strand opposite to that encoding the ERP transcripts .
In particular , the 1.9-kb transcript is similar in size to the SAP-1 transcript .

Southern blot hybridization analysis of genomic DNAs isolated from different species suggests that the ERP gene is highly conserved during evolution but might be absent in flies and yeasts ( data not shown ) .
Expression pattern of ERP in murine B-cell lines representing different developmental stages .
To gain further insight into the expression of the ERP gene during B-cell differentiation , we performed Northern blot hybridization analysis of poly ( A ) * mRNAs derived from a variety of murine B-cell lines representing different stages of B-cell development ( Fig .
7 ) .
High levels of ERP mRNAs were detected in all pre-B-cell lines tested ( Fig .
7 , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
Cell lines representing later stages of B-cell differentiation , including mature B-cell lines ( Fig .
7 , lanes 6 and 7 ) and myeloma cell lines ( Fig .
7 , lanes 8 to 11 ) , in contrast , expressed only very low levels of ERP .
Thus , the ERP gene appears to be expressed primarily at early stages of B-cell development and , therefore , might play a role in early B-cell development and gene expression .
Interestingly , approximately equal amounts of the 4.4- and 2.2-kb ERP transcripts were detected in all pre-B-cell lines , whereas the 1.9-kb ERP transcript was detectable only in some of the pre-B-cell lines ( Fig .
7 , lanes 1 , 2 , and 5 ) .
Significant expression of the ERP gene was also observed in the EL.4 T-cell line , PuS5-1.8 monocyte/macrophage cell line , and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts .
However , no expression of ERP was detected in the embryonal carcinoma cell line P19 , while upon differentiation of P19 cells Mor .

These results suggest that ERP expression is regulated upon B-cell and teratocarcinoma differentiation .
Chromosomal localization of the human ERP gene .
To determine the chromosome location of the ERP locus in the human genome we performed Southern blot hybridization analysis using Pvull-digested genomic DNA derived from a panel of hamster-human somatic cell hybrids carrying overlapping subsets of human chromosomes .
As shown in Fig .
8 , the presence of the human ERP -specific band correlates only with hybrids containing human chromosome 12 .
These data provide evidence that the ERP gene is located on human chromosome 12 , where no other known member of the ets family has been found .
ERP contains a carboxy-terminal negative regulatory domain which inhibits autonomous DNA binding .
To determine whether ERP can bind sequence specifically to DNA and to delineate the domains of ERP responsible for DNA binding , we created a series of different carboxy-terminal-deletion mutants of ERP as outlined in Fig .
9a .
In vitro-transcribed RNAs encoding either full-length ERP or the different deletion mutants were translated into Erotein in a wheat germ extract .
SDS-PAGE analysis of the [ *°S } methionine-labeled in vitro translation reaction mixtures revealed as the major products proteins of the expected molecular weights ( Fig .
9b , lower panel ) .
Small amounts of additional faster-migrating proteins were visible as well in some of the reaction mixtures because of either partial proteolysis , premature translational termination , or alternative internal initiation codons .

Shaded box , presence of the chromosome indicated at the top ; open box , absence of the chromosome ; black box , presence of both the chromosome and the human ERP gene .
The pattern of retention ( + ) of the human ERP gene in the hybrids is shown on the right .
To evaluate whether ERP can specifically interact with canonical ets-related binding sites , we tested the ability of in vitro-translated full-length or truncated ERP to bind specifically to an oligonucleotide containing the Drosophila E74 binding site ( 11 ) which has previously been demonstrated to bind several members of the ets family including the highly related ELK-1 and SAP-1 ( 28 , 70 , 71 , 90 ) .
We compared the abilities of wheat germ extracts containing the different-length ERP proteins and of unprimed wheat germ extracts to form complexes with the E74 DNA motif in EMSAs .
To ensure equivalent amounts of in vitro-translated protein in each EMSA reaction , we measured the amount of [ °°S ) methionine incorporation and adjusted for the number of methionines present in the different ERP proteins .
Molar equivalents of each ERP protein were used for EMSAs .
The E74 oligonucleotide formed several complexes with proteins present in the ERP extracts ( Fig .
9b , upper panel ) which were not formed by the control extract ( Fig .
9b , upper panel , lane 1 ) .
Some additional weaker complexes were formed by the control as well as all the other extracts .
Strikingly , both full-length ERP ERP , A NEW MEMBER OF THE eis FAMILY 3301 and the ERPAC396 deletion mutant formed much weaker protein-DNA complexes ( Fig .
9b , upper panel , lanes 2 and 3 ) than more extensive carboxy-terminal-deletion mutants of ERP ( ERPAC298 , ERPACZ222 , and ERPACI106 ) ( Fig .
9b , upper panel , lanes 4 to 6 ) .
These data suggested the existence of a potential negative regulatory domain at the carboxy terminus of ERP located between amino acids 298 and 396 which encompasses domain C and contains several putative MAP kinase phosphorylation sites .
DNA binding was the strongest in ERP AC106 , which contains primarily the amino-terminal ETS domain .
Further deletion to amino acid 61 ( ERPAC61 ) within the ETS domain completely abolished the DNA-binding capacity of ERP , demonstrating that the DNA-binding domain of ERP maps indeed to the ETS domain and is sufficient for specific DNA binding .
No protein-DNA complex formation was observed when a mutant E74 oligonucleotide was used as a probe in EMSAs ( Fig .
9c ) , verifying the sequence specificity of ERP interaction with the E74 DNA motif .
ERPAC298 , ERPAC222 , and ERPAC106 formed protein-DNA complexes with mobilities in the EMSA consistent with their relative molecular weights .
However , the most slowly migrating complexes formed with full-length ERP or ERPAC39Y6 did not correlate with their expected relative molecular masses and appeared to be of similar size as ERPAC298 , which is 100 amino acids smaller , raising the question of whether these bands may be due to complex formation with smaller translation products rather than the full-length proteins .
There was a weak smear ( C1 ) above this complex which was not observed in ERPAC298 and most likely represents a protein-DNA complex formed by full-length ERP with lower affinity than the other complexes .
To analyze in more detail which protein-DNA complex is formed by which translation product , in vitro translation reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE .
Slices representing different molecular weight regions were cut out of the gel , and proteins were eluted , denatured , and renatured in the presence of urea .
Aliquots of the renatured proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography for the presence and the size of in vitro-translated ERP proteins as shown in Fig .
9d , lower panel .
A second equivalent of renatured proteins was used for EMSAs using the E74 site as a probe ( Fig .
9d , upper panel ) .
Single , strong protein-DNA complexes were formed by renatured proteins recovered from the ERPAC298 , ERPAC222 , and ERPAC106 in vitro translations ( Fig .
9d , lanes 5 , 8 , and 10 ) , which correlated with the presence of single [ *S ] methionine-labeled proteins in SDS-PAGE and corresponded to the molecular weights expected for the particular deletion mutants .
Renatured protein recovered from full-length ERP translations , however , gave rise to only very weak complexes ( Fig .
9d , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
In particular , the fraction containing the apparent full-length 44-kDa ERP protein ( Fig .
9d , lane 2 ) formed only a very weak complex .
This protein-DNA complex ( Fig .
9d , lane 2 ) comigrated with a complex formed by renatured protein from the equivalent molecular weight region of the ERPAC298 translation ( Fig .
9d , lane 4 ) , despite the fact that no [ **°S ) methionine-labeled protein was present in this fraction of the ERPAC298 translation .
These denaturation-renaturation experiments most vividly demonstrate that the full-length ERP protein expresses negligible DNA-binding activity by itself and that , upon removal of an apparent carboxy-terminal negative regulatory domain , DNA-binding capacity is recovered .
ERP binds to functionally important efs-related binding sites in a variety of genes including the pre-B-specific IgH enhancer # site .

Vor .
14 , 1994 for the binding of ERP , we designed oligonucleotides encoding a whole spectrum of different functionally relevant binding sites for ets-related factors including sites of several B- or T-lymphoid-specific genes ( see Materials and Methods ) ( Fig .
10a ) .
The relative binding affinity and specificity of ERP for these sites were compared with its affinity for the E74 site in competition experiments .
Equivalent amounts of wild-type oligonucleotides were used as competitors in EMSA with equal amounts of ERPAC222 in vitro-translated protein and the E74 oligonucleotide as a probe ( Fig .
10b ) .
The wild-type E74 oligonucleotide competed effectively with complexes formed by ERPAC222 , whereas the mutant E74 oligonucleotide was unable to inhibit binding of ERPAC222 even at high concentrations ( Fig .
10b , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
Ten nanograms of wild-type competitor completely abolished binding of ERPAC222 to the E74 probe .
None of the other ets-related-binding-site oligonucleotides was as effective as the E74 oligonucleotide in competing for ERPAC222 .
Only the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) ICP4 oligonucleotide encoding the binding site for GA-binding protein ( GABP ) in the HSV ICP4 gene expressed an affinity similar to that of the E74 site for ERPAC222 ( Fig .
10b , lanes 6 and 7 ) , but it might contain actually two ets-binding sites .
Oligonucleotides encoding the IgH enhancer t site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 34 and 35 ) , the polyomavirus PEA3 site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 28 and 29 ) , and the Ick promoter ets site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 26 and 27 ) still competed efficiently with ERPAC222 , showing at least partial competition with 10 ng of oligonucleotide .
Other sites including the urokinase promoter ets site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 8 and 9 ) , the HIV-2 LTR CD3R site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 10 and 11 ) , the human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) LTR ets site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 14 and 15 ) , the murine sarcoma virus ( MSV ) LTR ets site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 18 and 19 ) , the c-fos promoter serum response element ( SRE ) site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 20 and 21 ) , the stromelysin promoter ets site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 30 and 31 ) , and the vpreB promoter ets site ( data not shown ) competed only weakly , leading to partial competition only at 100 ng of oligonucleotide .
Interestingly , virtually no competition was observed with the Ig ( x ) 3 ' enhancer ets site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 12 and 13 ) and the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class promoter ets site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 16 and 17 ) , which bind Pu.1 , as well as with the IL-2 promoter IL-2B and NF-AT sites ( Fig .
10b , lanes 22 to 25 ) , which interact with ELF-1 , and the T-cell receptor « a enhancer Ta2 site ( Fig .
10b , lanes 32 and 33 ) , which interacts with Ets-1 or ELF-1 .
Figure 10a summarizes the results obtained in this competition analysis , indicating the relative binding affinities of the different sites for ERPAC222 and the DNA sequence of the binding core .
On the basis of this experiment , we have compiled a putative consensus binding site for ERP ( Fig .
10a ) which is very similar to the consensus recognition sequences for Ets-1 , Ets-2 , GABPa , Fli-1 , and E74 ( 10 , 19 , 30 , 61 , 91 , 102 ) ERP , A NEW MEMBER OF THE eis FAMILY 3303 but divergent from the Pu.1 and ELF-1 consensus sequences ( 64 , 94 ) .
To analyze in more detail the interaction of ERP with some of the ets-related binding sites , we performed EMSAs with ERPAC222 and the control translation using several of the ets-related binding sites as probes ( Fig .
11a ) .
The E74 oligonucleotide formed the strongest protein-DNA complex , which comigrated with a similar strong complex formed by the HSV ICP4 oligonucleotide and was absent in the control reaction .
A specific protein-DNA complex with similar migration was obtained with the ERPACZ222 but not the control translation when the IgH enhancer # site , the MSV LTR ets site , or the Ick promoter ets site was used as a probe , even though the quantity was much less than with the E74 probe .
Virtually no specific complex formation was observed with the HIV-2 LTR CD3R site and the MHC class II ets site .
A strong , slowly migrating nonspecific complex which was much weaker in experiments for Fig .
9 and 10 was visible in all reactions in Fig .
11 .
The EMSA of Fig .
11 was carried out with a different batch of in vitro transcription-in vitro translation reaction mixture and had to be exposed for longer periods than those of Fig .
9 and 10 , suggesting that the fresh in vitro translation reaction was not as efficient as the previous one .
The results correlate relatively well with the affinities determined in the competition analysis .
Sequence specificities of the complexes formed by the IgH # site and the Ick ets site were , furthermore , confirmed by competition analysis with either wild-type or mutant IgH 1 site and Ick ets site oligonucleotides , ( Fig .
11b ) .
Wild-type but not mutant IgH 1 site and Ick ets site oligonucleotides competed efficiently with the specific complex .
An additional complex which was formed with both the ERPAC222 and the control translation product competed with both the wild-type and the mutant oligonucleotides , suggesting that this protein binds to sequences not directly overlapping the IgH 1 or the Ick ets site .
Interestingly , competition with the mutant oligonucleotides actually increased formation of the specific complex , most likely because of competition with the other unrelated protein which might bind with higher affinity to an overlapping site .
Results from these studies suggest that ERP interacts with various , but not all functionally relevant , efs-related binding sites , although with different affinities .
In this context it is particularly interesting that ERP binds to the IgH enhancer t site which is active primarily during early stages of B-cell development coinciding with the expression of ERP in the B-cell lineage .
Future experiments will clarify whether ERP is indeed the natural activator of the IgH # site .

ERP is expressed in a variety of tissues ; however , within the B-cell lineage , ERP is transcribed primarily at the pre-B-cell stage , and expression drastically declines upon B-cell maturation .
This expression pattern correlates with the enhancer activity of the IgH enhancer # site , and ERP is indeed able to bind specifically to this enhancer element .
Our results suggest an involvement of ERP in the regulation of B-cell differentiation and , possibly , in IgH gene expression as well .
ERP interaction with DNA appears to be inhibited by a carboxy-terminal negative regulatory domain , indicating the role of putative posttranslational modifications and/or protein-protein interactions in the control of DNA binding of ERP .
ERP was isolated on the basis of its homology to the ETS domain which is highly conserved among all ets-related proteins and which is responsible for DNA binding ( 55 , 61 , 85 , 94 ) .
ets-related proteins can be further grouped into subclasses on the basis of additional homologous protein domains which are 30 31 32 33 34 35 unique for particular members of the ets family ( for reviews , see references 55 , 61 , 85 , and 94 ) .
Amino acid sequence comparison demonstrates that ERP shows the highest homology to a particular subgroup of the ets family with distinctive features which includes SAP-1 ( 14 ) and ELK-1 ( 68 ) .
Both SAP-1 and ELK-1 are able to form a ternary complex with the SRF and bind to the SRE of the c-fos promoter in an SRF-dependent manner ( 14 , 25 , 28 , 71 , 90 ) .
Protein-protein interactions appear to be common mechanisms for the function of most , if not all , efs-related proteins .
Pu.1 , for example , cooperates with a second factor , NF-EMS ( 64 ) , and GABPa binds to GABPLB ( 38 , 89 ) .
Similarly to SAP-1 and ELK-1 , ERP contains the three homology regions A to C. Domain A , the ETS domain , appears to be involved in DNA binding and is the region which is highly conserved among all members of the ets family ( 55 , 61 , 85 , 94 ) .
Domain B has been shown to be involved in the interaction of SAP-1 and ELK-1 with SRF and has been found only in SAP-1 and ELK-1 ( 14 , 28 , 71 , 90 ) .

ERP contains a region of similarity to domain B , it is possible that ERP binds to SRF as well .
We are currently testing this possibility , but we were so far unable to detect any ternary complex formation with SRF ( 2 ) .
Domain C contains phosphorylation sites for MAP kinase and has been demonstrated to be involved in regulation by growth factors and transactivation ( 56 , 90 ) .
ERP contains putative MAP kinase phosphorylation sites homologous to the sites in SAP-1 and ELK-1 , suggesting a potential role in the regulation of ERP activity .
We have identified an additional shorter region of homology , domain D , that might encode a nuclear localization signal for ERP , ELK-1 , and SAP-1 .
While domains A to D are highly conserved , the remainder of the ERP protein reveals only limited similarity to SAP-1 or ELK-1 , even though there are some short stretches with similarity to SAP-1 , while other regions are similar to ELK-1 .
The relevance of these homologies for the biological function of ERP , SAP-1 , or ELK-1 has to be determined .
The small stretches of similarity and the divergent regions in the remainder of these proteins suggest that each of these ets-related proteins has unique features whether or not it is through interaction with particular binding sites , interaction with particular secondary factors , unique posttranslational modifications , or other undetermined func-tions .
It is likely that these unique domains play crucial roles in the diverse functions of ERP , SAP-1 , and ELK-1 .
Overall , ERP has a slightly higher sequence identity to SAP-1 ( 46 % ) than to ELK-1 ( 36 % ) .
A few short amino acid stretches in ERP which are not conserved in SAP-1 or ELK-1 are conserved in another member of the ets family , E74 ( 11 ) , which otherwise shows very little homology to ERP , SAP-1 , or ELK-1 outside the ETS domain .
The relevance of this region for the function of E74 is not known .
Both ELK-1 and SAP-1 are able to interact with DNA independently of SRF as well ( 28 , 71 , 90 ) .
The E74A-binding site of the Drosophila ecdysone-inducible E74A gene , for example , binds to ELK-1 and SAP-1 ( 28 , 70 , 71 , 90 ) , as well as to the ets-related protein E74 ( 11 ) , and can be transactivated by ELK-1 and SAP-1 ( 28 , 70 , 71 , 90 ) .
We show here by EMSAs that ERP interacts with the E74A site as well .
However , significant sequence-specific DNA-binding activity is detected only upon deletion of the carboxy terminus of ERP , which contains domain C , suggesting the existence of a negative regulatory domain in that region .
A protein-DNA complex with full-length ERP is observed in our experiments , but deletion mutant analysis and denaturation-renaturation studies indicate that this complex does not correspond to the expected mobility and most likely represents an early termination or degradation product of ERP .
ERP might have to interact with other proteins in vivo and/or might have to be posttranslationally modified , leading to derepression and increased affinity of ERP for DNA .
Negative regulatory domains have been found in several other members of the ets family including ELK-1 and Ets-1 ( 52 , 71 , 97 ) as well .
We demonstrate here that carboxy-terminal truncation of ERP which eliminates the conserved domain C reconstitutes DNA-binding activity .
Domain C and the surrounding regions contain several putative MAP kinase phosphorylation sites which are conserved in SAP-1 and ELK-1 as well and which have been shown to be crucial for growth factor-regulated transactivation by ELK-1 ( 56 ) .
A possible model predicts that the carboxy terminus represses DNA binding of ERP by an intramolecular mechanism in which the carboxy terminus masks the amino-terminal ETS domain .
Phosphorylation of certain amino acid residues in the carboxy-terminal region of ERP might affect the DNA-binding ability of ERP by conformational modification of the carboxy terminus , as has been observed for other transcription factors ( 9 , 54 ) .
Another possible mechanism might involve the interaction of ERP with a second protein either at the carboxy terminus or at domain B which might relieve the negative constraint on DNA binding .
Our deletion analysis of ERP , furthermore , confirms that the highly conserved ETS domain constitutes the DNA-binding domain .
This domain A is sufficient to bind sequence specifically to DNA .
The DNA-binding domains of ERP , ELK-1 , and SAP-1 are remarkably similar .
Nevertheless , a region of 6 amino acids close to the amino terminus is unique in each of these three proteins , and there are several other amino acid differences which could affect the DNA-binding specificity .
All members of the ets family share a common recognition sequence , 5-GGA ( A/T ) -3 ' ( 55 , 61 , 85 , 94 ) , which is located in the middle 3306 LOPEZ ET AL .
of the DNA-binding site , whereas the flanking sequences are divergent for different members of the ets family .
Differences in the ETS domain between ERP and SAP-1 or ELK-1 could therefore influence the precise recognition sequence for ERP , which might be slightly different from those of SAP-1 and ELK-1 .
Whereas full-length ERP expresses only negligible DNA-binding activity towards a variety of ets-binding sites , carboxy terminus-deleted ERP interacts with a variety of functionally relevant ets-binding sites with different affinities including the HSV ICP4 GABP site ( 89 ) , the IgH enhancer t site ( 47 ) , the polyomavirus PEA3 site ( 95 ) , the Ick promoter ets site ( 44 ) , the urokinase promoter ets site ( 60 ) , the HIV-2 LTR CD3R site ( 94 ) , the HTLV-I LTR ets site ( 21 ) , the MSV LTR ets site ( 61 ) , the c-fos promoter SRE site ( 14 , 25 ) , the stromelysin promoter ets site ( 96 ) , and the vpreB promoter ets site ( 34 ) .
Thus , ERP is another candidate factor for the transcriptional regulation of these genes .
An approximate consensus high-affinity binding site for ERP is similar to recognition sequences for Ets-1 , Ets-2 , ERG , Fli-1 , PEA3 , GABP , E74 , and ELK-1 ( 10 , 19 , 25 , 30 , 61 , 64 , 70 , 71 , 75 , 91 , 94 , 102 , 103 ) .
However , ERP displays very low or no affinity towards binding sites for two other members of the ets family , Pu.1 and ELF-1 , which recognize more divergent DNA motifs than the rest of the family ( 31 , 64 , 88 , 94 ) .
It is therefore unlikely that the slight differences in DNA-binding affinities among the majority of ets-related factors towards highly related recognition sequences will determine which member of the ets family will interact with a particular site in different genes .
We anticipate that the specific arrangement and combination of different regulatory sites surrounding an ets-binding site in a particular gene will favor the selection of a specific member of the ets family due to specific protein-protein interactions and potential posttranslational modifications .
At least four mRNA transcripts are detected on Northern blots hybridizing to ERP cDNA probes .
The levels of the transcripts , however , vary in different tissues and cell lines .
The 2.2-kb transcript appears to encode the ERP cDNA which we have cloned .
It contains a poly ( A ) tail at the 3 ' end , and preliminary primer extension analysis indicates the existence of two main transcription start sites within 100 nucleotides from each other , similar or identical to the 5 ' ends of our cDNAs .
The other mRNA species might encode either alternative splice products of ERP , transcripts of ERP genes , or antisense transcripts .
Indeed , we have observed that the antisense strand of the ERP cDNA encodes another long open reading frame for a putative polypeptide of 209 amino acids .
No homology to any known protein is apparent .
Therefore , we do not know at the moment whether this protein really exists .
Nevertheless , at least one other ets-related gene isolated from drosophila , D-elg , encodes an antisense transcript for an unidentified protein whose expression is coregulated with the D-elg gene ( 66 ) .
We are now in the process of verifying , using cRNA probes , whether any of the other transcripts is derived from the antisense strand of ERP .
Recent data from several laboratories suggest that ets-related proteins are essential in the regulation of many T-cell-specific genes including T-cell receptors a , B , and 8 , IL-2 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and CD3 ( 26 , 40 , 57 , 88 , 94 ) , and there is evidence that ets-related proteins play a role in B-cell gene regulation and differentiation as well ( 18 , 24 , 31 , 53 , 64 , 72 , 80 ) .
In particular , the Pu.1 factor appears to be involved in B-cell-specific expression of both IgH ( 2 ) and Ig ( x ) genes ( 64 ) .
Binding sites for Pu.1 were identified in the IgH intronic enhancer ( 2 , 59 ) and shown to be critical for B-cell-specific activation of the IgH enhancer ( 2 , 49 , 58 ) .
Similarly , a Pu.1-binding site in the 3 ' Ig ( x ) enhancer is Mor .

important for B-cell-specific activation of the Ig ( x ) enhancer , and Pu.1 interacts with a second B-cell-specific nuclear factor which binds to an adjacent site ( 64 ) .
Another member of the ets family , Ets-1 , is expressed in B cells as well , and ligation of membrane Ig leads to calcium-dependent phosphorylation of Ets-1 , suggesting that Ets-1 may play a role in B-cell gene regulation ( 19 ) .
A third member of the ets family , Spi-B , was recently shown to be expressed in B cells and might bind to similar sites as Pu.1 ( 72 ) .
In addition , Fli-1 and ERG-3 were shown to be differentially expressed in B cells and suggested to be involved in IgH gene regulation ( 80 ) .
Thus , ERP and several other ets-related genes are expressed in B cells , suggesting that , analogously to the apparent role of ets-related factors in the control of T-cell-specific gene expression , efs-related proteins might regulate B-cell-specific gene expression as well .
The expression pattern of ERP suggests a widespread tissue distribution of ERP , though to different degrees in the tissues analyzed .
Nevertheless , in the B-cell lineage it appears that ERP is highly expressed primarily at the pre-B-cell stage and expression is down-regulated upon maturation of B cells .
We do not know the function of ERP in B-cell development or gene regulation .
However , we speculate that ERP plays a role in early B-cell development and gene regulation , since expression of ERP drastically decreases upon B-cell maturation .
Interestingly , expression of ERP in these B-cell lines correlates well with the activity of the # enhancer element which we have identified in the IgH enhancer and which we have shown to be primarily active at the pre-B-cell stage ( 47 ) .
The # enhancer element contains a functionally crucial 5-GGAA-3 ' in the center of the site similar to other recognition sites for ets-related factors .
Recently , several members of the ets family including Ets-1 , Fli-1 , and ERG-3 were shown to bind to the IgH 1 site and to activate it when overexpressed ( 59 , 80 ) .
We demonstrate here that ERP is also able to bind specifically to the IgH r site .
Expression of ERG-3 and ERP , but not Ets-1 or Fli-1 , correlates with the activity of the 1 site , suggesting a possible role of either of these two factors in IgH gene regulation ( 47 , 59 , 80 ) .
Several other putative target genes for ERP which are transcriptionally active exclusively at the pre-B-cell stage include vpreB ( 5 ) , A5 ( 34 ) , TdT ( 53 , 78 ) , and mb-1 ( 39 ) .
The promoter regions of all these pre-B-cell-specific genes contain DNA sequences related to ets-binding sites and might represent targets for ERP .
Furthermore , several other B-cell-specific genes including IgH ( 2 , 22 ) , Ig ( x ) ( 64 ) , and FcesRIla ( 77 ) contain apparent binding sites for ets-related proteins in their regulatory regions .
It is likely that some of these genes are regulated by ERP .
Preliminary results presented here indicate that ERP is indeed able to interact with the vpreB ets-binding site but not with the Ig ( x ) ets site .
Since protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications play a crucial role in the DNA-binding capacity and transactivation of most members of the ets family including the highly related ELK-1 and SAP-1 and since ERP binds to DNA only upon deletion of the carboxy terminus , we can not rule out that the actual target sites for ERP are different from the sequences determined in our analysis .
Southern blot analysis revealed that the ERP gene is highly conserved during evolution , since we can detect specifically hybridizing bands in all mammalian , bird , and frog DNAs and weaker bands in nematode DNA .
However , we were unable to detect hybridization to fly or yeast DNA , suggesting either that these organisms do not contain any gene closely related to ERP or that our hybridization conditions were too stringent .
We have mapped the gene for ERP to human chromosome 12 .
No other member of the ets family has been located to this VoL .
14 , 1994 chromosome yet .
However , there are clusters of ets-related genes located on human chromosomes 11 and 21 ( 6 , 16 , 65 , 69 , 100 ) .
The involvement of transcription factors in tumorigenesis has only recently received more attention , when it was observed that many of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes indeed encode transcription factors ( 87 ) .
Chromosomal translocations involving transcription factor genes appear to be especially frequent in human leukemias and lymphomas ( 32 , 87 , 93 ) .
At least two ets-related genes , F/i-1 ( 65 ) and ERG ( 86 ) , have been directly implicated in human tumor formation .
Human chromosome 12 is involved in translocations in acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia ( 79 ) and in several other neoplasms .
Further analysis will determine whether the ERP gene is involved in translocations of chromosome 12 and whether ERP may act as an oncogene .
In conclusion , we have established ERP as a new member of the ets family with significant sequence homology to SAP-1 and ELK-1 .
We have demonstrated that ERP is developmentally regulated during B-cell and possibly teratocarcinoma differentiation .
Since ERP is expressed in several different tissues and cell types , it is likely that ERP plays an important role in regulation of a whole set of genes .
The fact that ERP is highly expressed in pre-B cells , binds to the IgH r site , and is downregulated upon B-cell maturation warrants further studies as to its involvement in B-cell differentiation and gene regulation .
