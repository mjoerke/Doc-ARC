Characterization of the Human elk-1 Promoter POTENTIAL ROLE OF A DOWNSTREAM INTRONIC SEQUENCE FOR elk-1 GENE EXPRESSION IN MONOCYTES* ( Received for publication , September 17 , 1998 , and in revised form , October 21 , 1998 ) Ulrich Lehmannt§ , Pascale Brocke ? # 1 , Jiuirgen Dittmer } , and Alfred Nordheim # ] ** From the { Institut fiir Molekularbiologie , Medizinische Hochschule Hannover , 30623 Hannover , and the \Institut fiir Zellbiologie , Abteilung Molekularbiologie , Universitit Tiibingen , Auf der Morgenstelle 15 , 72076 Titbingen , Germany To characterize the human eik-1 promoter , we mapped the transcriptional start site and isolated elk-1-specific genomic phage clones that contained extensive upstream and downstream sequences .
A TATA-like motif was identified immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site .
Functional analyses of DNA fragments containing the TATA element and the identification of a DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin site ( HS 1 ) in close proximity to the TATA box suggest that the identified TATA motif is important for elk-1 transcription in vivo .
Sequences upstream and downstream from the TATA box were found to contribute to elk-1 promoter activity .
A second hypersensitive site ( HS 2 ) was identified within the first intron in pre-monocytic cells , which express Elk-1 only when differentiating to monocytes .
In a variety of other cell types , which display a constitutive Elk-1 expression , HS 2 did not exist , suggesting that inducibility of elk-1 expression is associated with the presence of HS 2 .
Egr-1 and the serum response factor were found to interact specifically with the intronic sequence at +265 and +448 , respectively .
Because Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels were observed to increase significantly before induction of elk-1 expression , we propose that Egr-1 is important for the regulation of elk-1 transcription in differentiating monocytes .
The Ets family of transcription factors is composed of proteins that share the Ets domain , a DNA binding domain that recognizes a GGAA/T-based sequence ( for review , see Refs .
1-3 ) .
Ets proteins are involved in a variety of cellular activities , including proliferation and differentiation , and are suggested to contribute to the development of certain diseases ( for review , see Ref .
4 ) .
Based on the homology within the Ets domain , Ets proteins are divided into several subclasses .
One subclass of Ets factors consists of the ternary complex * This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ( No .

factors ( TCF 's ) , which are able to form a ternary complex with the serum response factor ( SRF ) and the serum response element ( SRE ) ( for review , see Refs .
5-7 ) .
TCFs include the Ets proteins Elk-1 , Sapla , Saplb , Net/Erp/Sap2 , and Netb ( 8 ) .
Although all TCFs can be activated by different mitogen-acti-vated protein kinases such as ERK , JNK , and p3 & /RK ( 6 , 8 ) , there are differences in the efficiency by which these kinases are able to phosphorylate the different TCFs ( 9-14 ) .
For in-stance , in NIHS3T3 cells , Elk-1 and Sapla are similarly well activated by p38 , but only Elk-1 is a good substrate for JNK .
Because certain stimuli activate certain signaling pathways , each TCF may serve as an effector for a specific set of stimuli .
One could speculate , therefore , that in some cell types , a particular stimulus may exert its effect on the cell through one , but not another TCF .
In such a case , the cell 's ability to respond to that stimulus would depend upon a sufficient expression level of this TCF , which , on the other hand , would allow this cell to control its sensitivity to certain stimuli by regulating the expression of this TCF .
By screening several cell lines for Elk-1 expression we found that , compared with a variety of non-monocytic cells , pre-monocytic cells expressed Elk-1 only at very low levels .
However , Elk-1 expression could be induced when these cells were stimulated to undergo differentiation toward mature monocytes upon exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .
To understand the mechanism underlying this monocyte-spe-cific regulation of Elk-1 expression , we cloned and analyzed the human e/k-1 promoter .
We were able to determine the transcriptional start site of this promoter , and we further located a TATA-like element immediately upstream of the start site and identified an intronic Egr-1 binding site as a potential TPA-responsive element .
The TATA box and the Egr-1 binding site were each found to be located within a hypersensitive area , HS 1 and HS 2 , respectively .
More importantly , HS 2 was observed to exist only in monocytic cells and not in cells showing a constitutive expression of elk-1 .
We assume that Elk-1 serves a specific function , e.g .
as an effector of a particular stimulus , in differentiating monocytes , which can not be replaced by another TCF such as Sapla , whose expression was found to be unchanged upon treatment with TPA .

Western Blotting-Nuclear extracts or cytosolic fractions were separated by SDS , 8 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before electrophoretic transfer onto a Hybond C Super membrane ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
After blocking with 5 % nonfat dry milk , the membranes were incubated with an anti-EGR-1 antiserum ( mouse anti-p82-EGR-1 , Santa Cruz ) at a concentration of 0.5 ug/ml in TBS for 1 h at room temperature .
The blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody prior to exposure to the ECL substrate ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
For detection of the signals x-ray films ( Kodak ) were exposed for 10-80 s. All Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech .
Flow Cytometry-Approximately 10° cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 % fetal calf serum and incubated at 4°C for 30 min with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled primary antibody ( Coulter-Immunotech ) .
After washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline and 2 % fetal calf serum , fluorescence intensities were measured in a flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Results were analyzed with the LYSIS software ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Construction of Luciferase Reporter Plasmids-Using the subcloned genomic fragments as templates the indicated segments of the promoter region were prepared by polymerase chain reaction , using oligonucleotide primers specific for this region and containing appropriate restriction sites for insertion into the polylinker of the plasmid pKS*/L ( 5 ) upstream of the luciferase gene .
Transient Transfection of Luciferase Reporter Gene Constructs-Rab-bit kidney epithelial-like cells ( RK 13 , ATTC CCL37 ) were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method essentially as described previously ( 5 ) .
Cells were harvested 86 h after transfection and lysed .
The cleared lysate was measured for luciferase activity .
A cytomegalovirus-B-galactosidase expression vector served as a measure for transfection efficiency .
All transfection experiments were performed at least three times .
RESULTS Identification and Characterization of Human elk-1 Genomic Clones-We screened a human genomic A library with DNA probes corresponding to the coding sequence and the 5'-untranslated region of human elk-1 .

The B21 clone included the 5'-untranslated regions ( exons I and II ) , large parts of the second intron , and sequences upstream of exon I .
Note that the last untranslated exon , exon II , is separated from the first translated exon , exon III , by a large , approximately 12-kilobase pair-long intron .
Because of the length of this intron , the B21 clone did not share any sequence with B6 or B9 .
Using fluorescence in sifu hybridization analyses , however , we have reported previously that B6 and B21 hybridize to the same locus on the X chromosome ( 24 ) .
This indicates that these sequences are genomically linked .
This was confirmed recently by Mills and co-workers who isolated genomic clones that contained sequences of both B6 and B21 .
In the process of screening with the B6 or B21 sequence we also identified an elk-1 related pseudogene that we mapped to chromosome 14932 . ''
Identification of the Transcriptional Start Site of the Human elk-1 Gene-The human osteosarcoma cell line TE85 constitutively expresses elk-1 at high levels .
* Poly ( A ) *® RNA was isolated from these cells and analyzed by the primer extension technique .
Using an oligonucleotide corresponding to a stretch of nucleotides between positions +166 and +186 of the B21 sequence ( see Fig .
3 ) , a major transcriptional start site was identified ( termed nucleotide position +1 ) ( Fig .
24 , arrow ) .

e-711/+679 smaller fragment in Fig .
24 may suggest an additional , minor transcriptional start site some 65 bp downstream of the major one .
However , by using RNase protection assays , performed with the XholSacl fragment as a probe ( Fig .
2B ) , we could only confirm the existence of the major start site ( data not shown ) .
According to these data , the start site is located 39 nucleotides further upstream of the 5'-end of the previously published elk-1 cDNA sequence ( 15 ) .
It places the transcriptional start site approximately 25 bp downstream of a TATA-like sequence ( Fig .
3 ) .
The TATA-like Element in the elk-1 Gene Supports Transcription in Transient Transfection Experiments-Several DNA fragments of human the elk-1 gene including the TATA motif ( Fig .
4A ) were cloned upstream of a luciferase gene and tested for their abilities to support transcription in transient transfection experiments using RK 13 cells .
Transfection with plasmid e-43 , which contained the minimal fragment -43/+63 , resulted in a luciferase activity that was approximately 10-fold higher than that obtained with the control plasmid missing this fragment ( Fig .
4B ) .
This suggests that the -43/+63 fragment can function as a promoter .
To test whether flanking sequences may affect promoter activity , we first gradually extended the e/k-1 promoter 5 ' up to nucleotide at position -936 .
Highest activity was found with the e-480 promoter construct , suggesting that enhancer element ( s ) were located between -43 and -480 .

sponse element-binding protein , and the CCAAT-binding protein ( Fig .

Further extension to -711 slightly decreased transcription from the eik-1 promoter .
The sequence between -711 and -986 was found to have a repressive effect on elk-1 promoter activity , suggesting that this region contains silencer element ( s ) .
When 3'-flanking sequences down to +679 were added to the e-711 promoter fragment , promoter activity was increased by 2-fold .
This implies that this downstream sequence , which contains binding sites for Egr-1 and SRF/TCF ( Fig .
3 ) , may contribute to the regulation of elk-1 gene transcription .
Similar data regarding the differential activities of the different promoter fragments were obtained when transfection experiments were performed with CV-1 cells ( data not shown ) .
A DNase I-hypersensitive Site Is Located around the TATA-like Element in elk-l-expressing TES85 Cells-Transcriptionally active regions in the chromatin are often susceptible to DNase I treatment .
To identify DNase I-hypersensitive site ( s ) within the human e/k-1 promoter , we subjected nuclei isolated from TE85 cells , which express elk-1 constitutively , to DNase I di-gestion .
After deproteinization and HindIII treatment , the genomic DNA was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization .
Fig .
5A shows a typical DNase I cleavage pattern obtained from hybridizing the blotted DNA with the elk-I-specific probe A ( Fig .
5B ) .

Transcriptional activation of the human elk-1 gene during monocytic differentiation of ML-1 cells .
Panel A , Northern blot analysis of elk-1 and monocytic marker gene expression ( MPO , CD14 ) in the course of TPA-induced ML-1 differentiation .
Cells were either untreated ( Zane C ) or treated with TPA for the indicated number of days ( lanes 1 , 2 , and 3 ; TPA concentration : 1.6 X 10° '' M ) .
As a control , the blot was rehybridized with a GADPH-specific probe .
Panel B , TPA-induced expression of monocyte surface marker genes ( CD11C , CD14 ) , as measured by flow cytometric analysis .
Panel C , the morphology of human pre-monocytic ML-1 cells observed , when these cells were left untreated ( upper picture ) or were treated with TPA for 3 days ( lower picture ) .
even high concentrations of DNase I , which allowed complete digestion of the HindIII fragment , did not lead to the generation of any other distinct fragment .
The size of the fragment resulting from DNase I treatment positions the DNase I-hypersensitive site ( HS 1 ) to an area around the TATA-like element , in close proximity to the Xhol site shown in Fig .
5B .
Results obtained from reprobing the blots with e/k-I-specific DNA probe B ( Fig .
5B ) allowed the same conclusion as to the location of HS 1 ( data not shown ) .
As with probe A , no additional hypersensitive site could be identified with probe B .
These probing strategies also allowed us to estimate HS 1 to extend over a region of approximately 150-200 bp .
A Second Constitutive DNase I-hypersensitive Site Downstream of the elk-1 TATA-like Element Was Identified in the Human Pre-monocytic Cell Line ML-1 , Which Displays Inducible elk-1 Expression-In contrast to a variety of non-monocytic cell lines , the human pre-monocytic cell lines ML-1 and U-9837 were found to synthesize very low basal levels of elk-1 mRNA ( Fig .
6A and data not shown ) .
Treatment with TPA triggered these cells to differentiate to monocytes ( Fig .
6C ) .
This was accompanied by the expression of monocytic markers such as CD14 and CD11C and by down-regulation of the expression of pre-monocytic proteins like MPO ( Fig .
6 , A and B ) .
In differentiating ML-1 ( and U-937 ) cells , elk-1 mRNA levels were found to be strongly up-regulated ( Fig .
6A ) , which resulted in enhanced Elk-1 DNA binding activity ( data not shown ) .

An additional DNase I-hypersensitive site ( HS 2 ) is present in the first intron of the elk-1 gene in monocytic ML-1 cells .
Panel A , nuclei of ML-1 cells , treated for 24 h with TPA , were analyzed for DNase I hypersensitivity .
Two regions of DNase I hyper-sensitivity , HS 1 and HS 2 , were observed .
Panel B , graphic depiction of the positions of the two HSs relative to the e/k-1 transcriptional start site and exons I and II .
Putative binding sites for transcription factors Egr1 , Elk-1 and SRF at these HSs are indicated .
TPA stimulation did not change the half-life of elk-1 mRNA ( ¢ ) , = 5 h ) ( data not shown ) , it is likely that transcriptional activation was responsible for the up-regulation of elk-1 .
In contrast to elk-1 , expression levels of other TCFs ( sap-1Ia and net ) remained unchanged ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Elk-1 fulfills a specific function in differentiating monocytes .
By analyzing ML-1 chromosomal DNA for elk- I-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites , we found an additional hypersensitive site , HS 2 , downstream of the TATA-like element within intron I ( Fig .
7 ) .
We estimate HS 2 to extend over some 150-200 bp in length .
HS 2 was also found in nonstimulated ML-1 cells ( data not shown ) , demonstrating that HS 2 was present before the elk-1 gene was transcriptionally activated by TPA .
In non-monocytic Jurkat T cells , SKW 6.4 B cells and , as shown above , TE85 cells , which constitutively express Elk-1 , HS 2 was not observed ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that a pre-established open chromatin structure within intron I represents a prerequisite for inducible elk-1 expression in monocytic cells .
HS 2 Contains Binding Elements for the Transcription Factors Egr-1 and SRF/TCF , Which Can Both Be Activated by TPA-The hypersensitive site HS 2 contains an SRE-like element at position +448 and an Egr-1 consensus binding site at +265 .
Because both SRF/TCF ( 25 ) and Egr-1 ( 26 , 27 ) can regulate transcription upon activation by TPA , we hypothesized that these transcription factors may be involved in TPA-induced transcriptional activation of the human e/k-1 gene .
To test this possibility , we first analyzed the abilities of Egr-1 and SRE/EIk-1 to bind to their consensus binding sites within HS 2 .
As shown in Fig .
8D , recombinant Egr-1 protein was able to bind to the putative Egr-1 binding site within intron I ( Zane 1 ) but failed to interact with a mutated version of this sequence ( lane 3 and see legend to Fig .
8 ) .
Similarly , we found that SRF could specifically bind to the intronic SRE-like sequence ( cl , Fig .
8E , lanes 1 and 7 ) and form a ternary complex with Elk-1 ( cll , lane 3 ) .
We next compared the expression pattern of Egr-1 and SRF with that of Elk-1 in differentiating ML-1 cells .
Egr-1 mRNA was detectable as early as 1 h of exposure to TPA ( data not shown ) , preceding the rise in e/k-1 expression .
Typically for an immediate-early response gene ( 26 , 28 ) , mRNA expression of Egr-1 was found to be transient , starting to decline rapidly after an additional 2-3 h of TPA treatment ( Fig .
8A ) .
The Egr-1 protein level and DNA binding activity were found to be strongly increased after 2 h of exposure to TPA ( Fig .
8 , B and C , lane 2 ) .
However , although Egr-1 protein levels remained unchanged for at least another 6 h in the presence of TPA ( Fig .
8B ) , the ability of Egr-1 to bind to the intronic Egr-1 binding site was found be decreased strongly subsequent to the initial 2-h TPA treatment ( Fig .
8C , lane 3 ) .
Thus , Egr-1 may be involved in the initial TPA-dependent up-regulation of elk-1 expression but is unlikely to contribute to elk-I transcription at a later stage of the differentiation process .
In contrast to the Egr-1 expression , SRF mRNA levels were not found to increase significantly before 6 h of TPA treatment , a time at which elk-1 expression already reached its maximum ( Fig .
8A ) .
This suggests that SRF could not participate in the TPA-induced rapid increase in elk-1 transcription but may have been needed to maintain a high expression level of Elk-1 during monocytic differentiation .
For this potential function , SRF might have required the newly produced Elk-1 and , in this way , may have initiated a positive feedback loop for Elk-1 expression .
DISCUSSION In an effort to characterize the human e/ik-1 promoter , we identified a TATA-like element immediately upstream of a major transcriptional start site , as determined by primer extension analyses and RNase protection assays .
We could show that a DNase I-hypersensitive site , termed HS 1 , was surrounding the TATA-like sequence , suggesting that the TATA-containing region was accessible for DNA-binding factors .
HS 1 extended over an approximate region of 150-200 bp and accordingly may have been generated by the removal of one nucleosome .
The presence of HS 1 was independent of whether expression of elk-1 was constitutive , as in TE85 cells , or induc-ible , as in ML-1 cells .
We could further demonstrate that a minimal elk-1 promoter , containing the TATA motif , was able to support transcription .
It is therefore very likely that this TATA sequence functions as a TATA box for elk-1 transcription in vivo .
The downstream sequence , including exon I , most of exon II , and the intron separating theses exons , was found to contribute to elk-1 promoter activity in transient transfections experi-ments .
Interestingly , a second DNase I-hypersensitive site , HS 2 , was found in the intronic sequence .
HS 2 was constitutively present in the monocytic cell lines ML-1 and U-987 , which display inducible e/k-1 expression .
In contrast , HS 2 was not found in non-monocytic cells lines TE85 , Jurkat , and SKW 6.4 , which expressed elk-1 at constant high levels .
This may suggest that the potential for the inducibility of elk-1 expression is associated with the constitutive presence of HS 2 and the accessibility of this area for certain DNA-binding proteins .
Two transcription factors , Egr-1 and SRF , could specifically bind to the HS 2 region and were found to be up-regulated in differentiating ML-1 cells along with elk-1 .
We have also preliminary data suggesting that both Egr-1 and SRF can increase elk-1 promoter activity through their cognate binding sites within the HS 2 sequence ( data not shown ) .
Egr-1 is known to be involved in differentiation processes , such as macrophage development ( 26 , 29 ) and may therefore be a potential candidate involved in TPA-mediated induction of elk-1 transcription .
On the other hand , eik-1 expression was found to be elevated even after 3 days of TPA treatment ( data not shown ) , whereas Egr-l1 was only temporarily expressed , and Egr-1 DNA binding activity was only detectable for a couple of hours .
This may suggest that Egr-1 may be important 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Human elk-1 Promoter 1743 A + TPA ( h ) B o 2 4 6 s 10 12 2x lc + TPA ( h ) 0 2 4 6 8 as =a wen witb won gem ~ > elk-1 « an egr-1 a as co co -- o-Egr-1 BB 4G no t4 SRF w Gite Gam « = - 68 kD GAPDH @ as as @ as to as to tn C D SRE/EBS SRE/EBS SRE/mEBS ceegm1 - - - - + probe WT _M psi ) ; ee meme ts rar : R $ 0080 poot o > # # + + # TPA Q 2 4 6 2 h Egr-1 + - + EKk1T - + 4 - + + - + + Egr-1/ 1 _ u—Egr—1 } '' ‘ Egr-1 -t » « cll - » » « ae Cl .

for initiation of elk-1 transcription at early stage of the differentiation process , to be replaced by other factors that allow long lasting up-regulation of efk-1 expression .
Such a factor could be an Ets protein because a putative Ets binding site was found to be located immediately downstream of the Egr-1 site .
Several Ets proteins , including PU.1 , Ets1 , and GABPa , are expressed in monocytic cells ( 30-32 ) .
Of these , PU.1 was observed to be able to bind to the Ets binding site of the elk-1 promoter ( data not shown ) and was reported to be up-regulated during differentiation of pre-monocytic U-9837 cells ( 82 ) .
U-987 was also found here to show an increased elk-1 expression upon TPA treatment ( data not shown ) .
Further investigations are required to elucidate the regulatory function of the intronic sequence containing HS 2 and the roles of Egr-1 , Ets factors and SRF for elk-1 transcriptional regulation in monocytic cells .
