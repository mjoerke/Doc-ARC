Our findings show that suppression of NF-KB activity with cell-permeable SN50 peptide , which masks the nuclear localization sequence of NF-xB1 dimers and prevents their nuclear localization , induces apoptosis in resting normal human PBL .
Inhibition of NF-B resulted in the externalization of phosphatidylserine , induction of DNA breaks , and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis .
DNA fragmentation was efficiently blocked by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and partially blocked by Ac-DEVD-fmk , suggesting that SN50-mediated apoptosis is caspase-dependent .
Interestingly , apoptosis induced by NF-B suppression , in contrast to that induced by TPEN ( N , N , N , N ' -tetrakis [ 2-pyridylmethylJethylenediamine ) or soluble Fas ligand ( CD95 ) , was observed in the absence of active death effector proteases caspase-l-like ( IL-1 converting enzyme ) , caspase-3-like ( CPP32/Yama/apopain ) , and caspase-6-like and without cleavage of caspase-3 substrates poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor-45 .
These findings suggest either low level of activation is required or that different caspases are involved .

NF- « B consists of multiple members of the Rel family of proteins that include NF- « B1 ( p105/p50 ) , NF- « B2 ( pl00/p52 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , RelB , and c-Rel ( 1 , 2 ) .
Rel proteins form hetero- and homodimeric complexes that differ in their trans-activating activity ( 1 ) .
In T lymphocytes , the RelA/p50 het-erodimer is known to initiate transactivation , whereas homodimers of p50 appear to be suppressive ( 1 , 2 ) .
The NF- « B dimers are present in cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to inhibitory sub-units , IxBs ( 3-7 ) .
Upon activation IKB is phosphorylated , which marks the inhibitor for ubiquitination and degradation by the pro-teasome-dependent pathway ( 8-11 ) .
This process allows translocation of active NF-KB complexes into the nucleus , where they bind to specific DNA motifs in the promoter/enhancer regions of target genes and activate transcription ( 8-13 ) .
There is growing evidence that NF- « B regulates the susceptibility of certain cell types to apoptosis through the transcriptional control of protective genes ( 1 , 14 , 15 ) .
Knockout transgenic mice lacking the RelA component of NF- « B complex displayed embryonic lethality and liver cell apoptosis ( 16 ) .
Inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation also enhanced apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation or the chemotherapeutic drug , danorubicin ( 17 ) .

Addition of various inhibitors of NF- « B/Re !
activation to normal murine B lymphocytes or to B cell lymphomas resulted in apoptosis ( 18 , 19 ) .
A protective role for c-Rel in preventing this process was confirmed using microinjection of its specific inhibitor , I « Ba , or injection of Ab to the c-Rel subunit ( 18 , 19 ) .
Additional findings suggest that ligation of CD95 ( Fas/APO1 ) depressed NF-KB activation by causing the degradation of the NF- « B subunit RelA , a process that may enhance the decay of an immune response ( 20 ) .
Recent studies have identified the involvement of multiple caspases in the proteolytic cascade of apoptosis ( 21-26 ) .
Various stimuli that induce apoptosis , including UV , Fas Ag , drug treatment , growth factor withdrawal , and virus infection , have been shown to activate caspases that specifically cleave proteins at the C terminus of aspartic acid residues ( 27-30 ) .
Caspases are synthesized as zymogens that require proteolytic cleavage to generate active enzyme subunits .
These activating cleavage events are conducted by other caspases and are thought to represent a major regulatory step in the apoptosis pathway ( 21-26 ) .
Activated caspases cleave several target proteins that include poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) ® ( 31 , 32 ) , retinoblastoma protein ( 33 , 34 ) , cytoskeletal proteins ( 35-38 ) , Bcel-2 ( 39 ) , and Bel-x , , ( 40 ) .
A recent study has also identified RelA as a substrate for activated caspase-3 ( 20 ) .
Cleavage of the 45-kDa subunit of DNA fragmentation factor ( DFF-45 ) by activated caspases leads to fragmentation of genomic DNA into nucleosomal fragments , one hallmark of apoptosis ( 41 ) .
The role NF- « B plays in the regulation of apoptosis in T lymphocytes has not been well defined .

Here , we show that , in resting human peripheral blood-derived T cells , the inhibition of NF- « B activation results in apoptosis .
The cell-permeable peptide SN50 was found not to inhibit the stimulus-dependent degradation of the inhibitor I « Ba , but rather to block the nuclear translocation of NF- « B ( 43 ) .
This inhibitory peptide induced exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface , an early event in apoptosis , and the formation of specific DNA breaks , as defined by DNA laddering and TUNEL assay .
SN5O-mediated apoptosis is caspase-depen-dent , since DNA fragmentation was efficiently blocked by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and partially blocked by DEVD-fmk .
However , apoptosis occurred in the absence of detectable active caspase-1-like ( IL-1 converting enzyme ( ICE ) ) , caspase-3-like ( CPP32/Yama/apopain ) , and caspase-6-like proteases and without detectable proteolysis of PARP and DFF-45 , suggesting that either low level of activation is required or different caspases are involved .
Preactivation with either IL-2 or PMA/ionomycin induced NF-KB activation and prevented apoptosis following exposure to SN50 .
However , continued exposure to SN50 did induce apoptosis in preactivated T cells , which coincided with suppression of NF-KB .
Materials and Methods Abs and reagents SN50 and SN50 M peptides and Ab to PARP were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories ( Plymouth Meeting , PA ) .
Abs used in Western blotting for NF- « BI1 ( p50 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , IxBa , DFFE-45 , and caspase-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Abs to Bcl-2 , Bax , and caspase-3 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories ( Lex-ington , KY ) .
Secondary HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit Abs were purchased from Amersham ( Arlington Heights , IL ) .
The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and DEVD-fmk were purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) .
Reagents used in magnetic T cell separation were obtained from StemCell Technologies ( Vancouver , Canada ) .
Recom-binant human IL-2 was provided by Chiron Therapeutics ( Emeryville , CA ) .
PMA , ionomycin , and N , N , NV ' , NV'-tetrakis [ 2-pyridylmethyl ] ethyl-enediamine ( TPEN ) were obtained from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) .
Medium used for the culture of T cells was RPMI 1640 ( BioWhittaker , Walkers-ville , MD ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) , 1-glu-tamine ( 2 mM ) , gentamicin ( 50 mg/L ) , sodium pyruvate ( 1 mM ) , and nonessential amino acids ( 0.1 mM ) ( Life Technologies , Long Island , NY ) .
Isolation of peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes PBL from healthy volunteers were isolated and purified as previously described ( 44 , 45 ) .
In brief , PBL were subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque ( Phar-macia , Uppsala , Sweden ) density gradient centrifugation and then depleted of macrophages , B cells , and NK cells by negative selection using the magnetic cell separation procedure ( StemCell Technologies ) .
The T cell isolation procedure yielded cells that were > 98 % positive for CD3 , as determined by immunocytometry .
Immunocytometry All analyses were performed for 3,000 or 10,000 event list mode files acquired through a forward vs orthogonal scatter gate .
Matched isotypic controls were used for each particular subclass of Ig and system employed .
Analyses were performed on the FACScan ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) .
Live gating of the forward and orthogonal scatter channels was employed to exclude debris and to selectively acquire lymphocytes events .
All values presented are based on percent lymphocytes as determined by light scatter .
Individual fluorescent populations were determined through the use of acquisition and contouring/quadrant analysis software ( CellQuest ; Becton Dickinson ) .
Cell lysis and Western blot analysis Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously ( 46 ) in buffer containing protease inhibitors , aprotinin ( 5 pg/ml ) , leupeptin ( 2 ug/ml ) , and PMSF ( 1 mM ) .

The cytoplasmic extract was aliquoted and the nuclear pellet rinsed with hypotonic buffer A. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 60 pl of buffer C ( 25 % glycerol , 20 mmol/L HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 0.42 mol/L NaCl , 0.1 mmol/L EGTA , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 1 mmol/L DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 5 ug/ml aprotinin , 2 ug/ml leupeptin , 100 ug/ml Pefabloc , and 100 ug/ml chymostatin ) and rotated at 4°C for 20 min .
The nuclear fraction was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C .
Protein concentration was measured with a commercial kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .
Equivalent amounts of protein from whole cell lysates , cytoplasmic , and nuclear fractions ( 10 pg ) were mixed with equal volume of 2X Laemmli sample buffer , boiled , and resolved by electrophoresis in 7.5 % and 14 % SDS-PAGE .
The proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane using an electroblotting apparatus ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) ( 15 V , 3 mA/cm '' for 27 min ) .
Membranes were incubated in blocking solution containing 5 % nonfat dry milk , in TBS overnight to inhibit nonspecific binding .
The membranes were then incubated with specific Ab ( 1 pug/tol ) for 1 h. After washing in Tris/0.1 % Tween 20 for 30 min , membranes were incubated for another 30 min with HRP-conjugated secondary Ab .
The membranes were then washed and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL Western Blotting Kit ; Amersham ) .

EMSA Nuclear extracts were prepared from T cells before and after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin ( 0 , 0.5 , and 2 h ) .
Binding reactions were performed using 8 pg of nuclear protein preincubated on ice for 10 min in a 20-pl total reaction volume containing 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 80 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 8 % glycerol , and 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Phar-macia ) .
The reaction mixture was then incubated with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature .
Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.25 TBE buffer ( 22.2 mM Tris , 22.2 mM boric acid , 0.5 mM EDTA ) .
Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to film at -80°C .
Oligonucleotide containing a tandem repeat corresponding to the xB element of the IL-2R gene was used as the probe .
Radiolabeled double-stranded probe was prepared by annealing a coding strand template to a complimentary 10 base primer and filling in the overhang using DNA polymerase I in the presence of [ a-*P ] dCTP .
The sequence was 5'-CAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCTT-3 ' ; and the underlined portion represents the « B binding motif .
Radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes were prepared that correspond to NF-AT ( 5-CGCCCAAAGAG GAAAATTTGTITTCATA-3 ' ) and AP-1 ( 5-CGCTTGATGACTCAGC CGGAA-3 ' ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Measurement of caspases activity Caspase and caspase-3 activity was measured using fluorometric tetrapep-tide substrates .
The assays were performed in 96-well plates by incubating 20 pg of cell lysates with 180 pl of reaction buffer ( 100 mmol/L HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) , 20 % v/v glycerol , 5 mmol/L DTT , and 0.5 mmol/L EDTA ) containing 50 uM YVAD-AMC , VEID-AMC , or DEVD-AMC ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) .
Release of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin ( AMC ) was monitored after 1 h of incubation at 37°C on a microplate fluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm , respectively .
Measurement of apoptosis Early apoptotic changes were identified by apoptosis detection kit with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V , which binds to exposed phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells ( 47 ) according to protocol provided with the kit ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
DNA fragmentation was detected using The Phoenix Flow Systems ( San Diego , CA ) APO-BRDU kit according to the protocol provided with the kit .
Briefly , PBL were harvested , washed in PBS , and 1 X 10° cells were resuspended in 1 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice , washed twice with ice cold PBS , and fixed in 70 % cold ethanol overnight .
The fixed cells were washed twice in wash buffer , incubated with DNA labeling solution , followed by incubation with fluorescein-PRB-1 Ab solution and analysis by flow cytometry in the presence of propidium iodide/RNase solution .
DNA laddering as another measure of DNA fragmentation was determined by horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis using a previously published method ( 48 ) .
Apoptosis was also determined by conventional light microscopy .
Spe-cifically , cytospin samples were assessed for the cellular and nuclear changes characteristically associated with apoptotic cell death ( cell shrink-age , chromatin condensation , and karyorrhexis ) .

Results The SN5O peptide induces apoptosis in PBL SN50 is composed of a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) for NF- « B1 ( p50 ) linked to the hydrophobic region of the signal peptide of Kaposi fibroblast growth factor , a cell-permeable carrier ( 43 ) .
SN50 blocks the intracellular recognition mechanism for the NLS on p50/p50 homodimers and heterodimers ( p50/ReIA ) that inhibits their nuclear translocation in Jurkat T cell line ( 43 , 49 ) .
To determine whether NF-KB activity might regulate the survival of human peripheral blood-derived T cells , we incubated resting T cells with varying concentrations of SN50 peptide for 24 h before performing the TUNEL assay .
Concentration-dependent induction of DNA fragmentation by SN50 peptide is presented in Fig .
14 and illustrates that apoptosis is observed with a concentration of 25 ug/ml , although 75 ug/ml is most active .
The level of apoptosis coincided with the degree of NF-KB inhibition mediated by different concentrations of SN50 peptide ( Figs .
1 and 7 ) .

Annexin V binding in SN5Q-treated T cells .
T lymphocytes were incubated either in the presence or absence of 75 pg/ml SN50 peptide for 24 h followed by staining with FITC-conjugated annexin V and analysis by flow cytometry as described in Materials and Methods .
While the results described above suggested that inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation leads to induction of apoptosis , possible nonspecific effects of SN50 peptide were examined .
To show that apoptotic activity of SN50 peptide is based on its effect on NF- « B nuclear translocation , T lymphocytes were incubated with 75 ug/ml of control SN50 M peptide , which has mutations in two residues within the nuclear localization sequence and does not prevent NF-kB nuclear translocation ( 43 ) ( Fig .
7 ) .
In contrast to SN50 , the mutant peptide did not induce apoptosis ( Fig .
1C ) .
To define the time frame required for SN50-mediated apoptosis , naive T cells were treated with 75 ug/ml of SN50 peptide and harvested at various time points as indicated ( Fig .
2 ) .
The induction of DNA fragmentation by SN50 peptide in T lymphocytes was noticeable after 6 h of incubation .
The percentage of apoptotic cells continued to increase for up to 24 h following the addition of SN50 peptide .
Additional experiments verified that SN50 does indeed induce DNA fragmentation in PBL .
In one set , DNA fragmentation was confirmed by the demonstration of characteristic DNA laddering in agarose gel after T cells were cocultured for 24 h with the inhibitory peptide ( 75 ug/ml ) ( Fig .
1B ) .
Morphological studies were also performed on T cells after exposure to either SN50 or TPEN , a Zn chelator that is known to induce apoptosis ( 50 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 , similar changes in morphology were noted when T cells were treated with either SN50 or TPEN .
In both cases , changes characteristic for apoptotic cells were seen , and this included fragmentation of the nuclei as well as nuclear condensation .
SN50 treatment induces phosphatidylserine externalization in naive T lymphocytes Previous studies demonstrated that phosphatidylserine is exported to the outer plasma membrane leaflet of apoptotic cells to serve as a trigger for recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes ( 51-53 ) .
Phosphatidylserine externalization is an early and widespread event occurring during apoptosis of various cell types .
This process can be measured using annexin V , a protein with a high affinity for this lipid ( 47 ) .
Here , we determined whether the apoptosis induced in resting T cells by SN50 involved the externalization of phosphatidylserine .
Using annexin V staining , low levels of phosphatidylserine were present on T cells cultured in medium .
In contrast , incubation of PBL with SN5O peptide resulted in increased level of phosphatidylserine externalization ( Fig .
4 ) .
These findings show that prevention of NF- « B nuclear localization in naive T cells can induce two critical events involved in apoptosis , phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA breaks .

Induction of DNA breaks by SN5O peptide treatment is blocked by caspase inhibitors .
A , Naive T cells were incubated with and without SN50 in the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Ac-DEVD-fmk .
After 24 h , cells were assessed by the TUNEL assay .
B , Jurkat T cells were incubated alone or with soluble FasL ( CDI5L ) for 24 h in either the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitors mentioned in A .
Cells were then assayed for DNA breaks by TUNEL .
Apoptosis induced by SN50 is caspase-dependent but occurs in the absence of detectable caspase-1- , caspase-3- , and caspase-6-like activity Recent studies have identified members of the family of caspase proteases ( formerly ICE/CED-3 proteases ) as key participants in apoptosis that act upstream of endonucleases ( 22 , 23 ) .
It is well documented that a variety of apoptotic agents induce sequential activation of caspases in different cell types ( 21-30 ) .
It has also been shown that activation of ICE/CED-3 family proteases is required for phosphatidylserine externalization during CD95-induced apoptosis ( 54 ) .
To assess the potential involvement of caspase family members in apoptosis induced by inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation , we tested whether the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Ac-DEVD-fmk would prevent DNA breaks induced by SN50 .
Z-VAD-fmk is considered a general caspase inhibitor , while the DEVD sequence inhibits primarily caspase-3 , although caspase-6 , -7 , -8 , and -10 are also affected ( 55 ) .
Six experiments were performed , and a representative experiment is presented in Fig .
5A .
Pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk efficiently blocked SN50-mediated apoptosis ( mean 87 + 8.9 % SD reduction , n = 6 ) , whereas Ac-DEVD-fimk partially blocked DNA breaks ( mean 57 + 29.6 % SD reduction , » = 6 ) .
As a control for both inhibitors , we tested their ability to block Fas ( CD95 ) -medi-ated apoptosis of the Fas-sensitive Jurkat T cell line .
Treatment with soluble Fas ligand ( FasL ) ( CD95L ) ( 100 ng/m ! )
for 24 h induced apoptosis in Jurkats ( 48 % apoptotic cells ) ; however , Z-VAD-fmk as well as Ac-DEVD-fmk were effective at blocking 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 594 INHIBITION OF NF- « B INDUCES APOPTOSIS OF T CELLS A YVAD-AMC DEVD-AMC VEID-AMC 20000 M 20000 mom ras £ 2 @ 20000 - { £500 .

- Suppression of p5O/ReIA nuclear localization by SN50 peptide does not induce detectable caspase-1- , caspase-3- , or caspase-6-like activity in naive T cells .
A , Normal T cells were incubated in either medium alone or in the presence of 75 pg/ml SN50 peptide for the indicated time .
Cell lysates were assayed with fluorogenic substrates ( YVAD-AMC , DEVD-AMC , VEID-AMC ) as described in Materials and Methods .
Aliquots of the same cells were subjected to 7.5 % SDS-PAGE , blotted , and probed with anti-PARP ( B ) and anti-DFF-45 ( C ) Abs .
Fas-mediated killing ( Fig .
5B ) .
The differential ability of Ac-DEVD-fmk to block apoptosis mediated by SN50 and FasL suggests that there may be differences in the caspases involved in the death pathways induced by these two agents .
To determine which caspases are activated as a result of suppressing NF- « B , we examined lysates from SN50-treated T cells for their ability to cleave YVAD-AMC , DEVD-AMC , and VEID-AMC fluorogenic substrates .
Enzymatic activity was monitored after 6 and 24 h of T cell treatment with 75 pg/ml SN50 peptide .
As shown in Fig .
6A , there was no cleavage of these substrates by lysates of T lymphocytes treated with SN50 .
Immunoblotting with the same lysates demonstrated that there was no change in the expression levels of either caspase-1 or caspase-3 before and after stimulation , and there was no evidence of cleavage products that are present following the activation of these two proteins ( data not shown ) .
In parallel , cleavage of PARP protein , which is one of the well-established intracellular substrates for caspase-3 ( 31 , 32 ) , was studied by immunoblotting ( Fig .
6B ) .
No proteolytic cleavage of PARP protein was detected in T cells treated with 75 pg/ml SN50 peptide .
There was also no detectable caspase-3-dependent cleavage of DFF-45 ( Fig .
6C ) .
However , with the same cells , caspase activation was demonstrated after 24 h of treatment with TPEN , as evident by cleavage of all three fluorogenic substrates .
Moreover , there was detectable cleavage of PARP and DFF-45 in TPEN-treated cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
The activation of caspase enzymatic activity was also easily detected in Jurkats cells stimulated with FasL ( V. Kolenko , unpublished observations ) .
These experiments further suggest that apoptosis of naive T lymphocytes mediated by inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation may involve distinct set of caspases than those induced by TPEN and FasL .
Bel-2 , Bcl-x , , and Bax proteins are involved in the regulation of cell susceptibility to apoptosis where Bcl-2 or Bcl-x , inhibits apoptosis , while Bax promotes apoptosis ( 40 , 56 , 57 ) .
We examined the levels of Bcl-2 , Bcl-x , , and Bax proteins in naive T cells cultured with or without SN50 peptide to determine whether the levels are modulated in a way that suggests a role for these proteins in regulating SN50-mediated apoptosis .
Recent studies have shown that resting PBL express high levels of Bcel-2 and Bax proteins with no detectable expression of Bcl-x ( 56 , 58 ) .
In agreement with this observation , we found high levels of Bel-2 and Bax protein in resting T lymphocytes that did not vary after 24 h of cell treatment with 75 ug/ml SN50 peptide ( data not shown ) .
At this time , > 60 % of the T cell population treated with SNO had undergone apoptosis as determined by TUNEL assay .
No detectable level of either Bel-x , , or Bcl-x , proteins was observed in naive T lymphocytes cultured in medium alone or in the presence of SN50 peptide .
Induction of apoptosis in T cells is attributable to suppression of « B binding activity Here , we document that the SN50 peptide inhibits the nuclear localization of NF-KB in peripheral blood-derived T cells .
Incubation for 1 h with SN50 ( 50 and 75 ug/ml ! )
reduced the background level of « kB binding observed in resting T cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
It also inhibited the increase in « B binding activity following 2 h of stimulation with PMA/ionomycin .
SN50 M that had 2 of 10 NLS residues mutated did not inhibit DNA binding activity .
Immunoblotting ( Fig .
7B ) confirmed that SN50 treatment , in a concentration-dependent manner , prevented nuclear localization of RelA and p50 after stimulation , however it had no effect on the cytoplasmic levels of these proteins .
At 75 pg/ml , SN50 also eliminated the background level of Rel proteins that are present in the nuclei of resting cells .
These experiments also demonstrated that SN50 mediates its effect on NF- « B dimers following normal degradation of the inhibitor IkBa ( Fig .
7C ) .

- SN50 peptide inhibits NF-KB activation in the presence of normal degradation of the inhibitor , IxBa .
A , Highly enriched naive T cells were cultured in medium alone or treated with indicated concentrations of SN50 peptide for 1 h before stimulation with PMA ( 20 ng/ml ) /ionomycin ( 75 ug/ml ) .
« B binding activity was detected in nuclear extracts by performing EMSA with a labeled xB probe .
B , Aliquots of the same cells were subjected to Western blotting to demonstrate dose-dependent suppression of nuclear translocation of NF- « B/ReIA by SN50 peptide .
C , Immunoblotting for IxBa in cytoplasmic extract shown in B .
We wanted to know if the induction of apoptosis in normal resting T cells was linked to the defect in NF-KB activation .
There-fore , we initially tested whether SN50 was selective at blocking NF- « B activation without altering nuclear localization of other transcription factors .
At 75 ug/ml , SN50 inhibited binding of nuclear extracts to AP-1 , NF-AT , as well as the xB probe , which is consistent with a recent report where 210 ug/ml of SN50 prevented nuclear localization of multiple transcription factors ( 49 ) .
However , at 37.5 ug/ml ( n = 3 ) , SN50 appeared selective in that « B binding activity was blocked , whereas AP-1 and NF-AT binding activity was unaffected ( Fig .
8 ) .
In the same experiments , where only NF-KB activation was suppressed , there was consistent induction of apoptosis , suggesting that defective NF-KB is responsible for the initiation of apoptosis in SN50-treated T lymphocytes .
We also determined whether another agent known to suppress NF- « B activation would also induce DNA breaks in T cells and thus reproduce the results observed with SN50 peptide .
We used N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) , since it has been shown to inhibit « B binding activity ( 18 ) .
Pretreatment with TPCK ( 100 uM ) prevented PMA/ionomycin induction of NF- « B ( Fig .
94 ) .
TPCK appears to function by interfering with proteo-some activity , which blocks the stimulus-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa ( 18 ) ( Fig .
9B ) .
We show here that suppression of NF-KB activation by TPCK can result in the induction of DNA breaks ( TUNEL assay ) ( Fig .
9C ) within 24 h , suggesting that inhibition of « B binding activity through distinct mechanisms can induce the death pathway in naive T cells .
Similar results were also obtained with a new BAY 11-7082 inhibitor that selectively blocks IxBa degradation ( 59 ) .

apoptosis .
Within 15 min of T cell activation , there is a significant increase in the nuclear localization of RelA , c-Rel , and p50 dimers ( 55 ) .
This translocation of Rel proteins coincides with an increase in « B-specific DNA binding activity , where the peak activity occurs within 2 h of stimulation ( 60 ) .
Preactivation of T cells with PMA/ionomycin for 2 h completely blocked DNA fragmentation induced by a 24-h exposure to SN50 ( Fig .
10 ) .
In the same cells that were not preactivated with PMA/ionomycin , SN50 induced significant apoptosis ( 48 % ) .
Similar results were observed with IL-2 , which is also known to activate NF- « B .
These results show that prior activation and nuclear translocation of NF- « B can protect cells from apoptosis mediated by SN50 .
However , the protective effect of preactivation is eventually reversed by continued exposure to SN50 after 3 days through the inhibition of further NF- « B activation ( our unpublished observations ) .
Discussion The involvement of NF- « B in regulating the apoptotic response has been suggested previously by several groups ( 1 , 14-19 ) .
Inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation increased the susceptibility of cells to undergo apoptosis induced by TNF- « , ionizing ra-diation , and cancer chemotherapeutic drugs ( 17 ) .
The suppression of NF-KB activation by protease inhibitors that block IxBa degradation induced apoptosis in murine splenic B cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
Similar findings were also reported following the microinjection of either GST-IxBa fusion protein or an Ab to c-Rel ( 18 , 19 ) .
In contrast , ectopic expression of c-Rel was found to ablate the induction of apoptosis induced in B cells following suppression of NF- « B activation by inhibitors of degradation ( 18 , 19 ) .

Suppression of NF- « B activation by TPCK can induce DNA breaks in naive T cells .
A , T cells were incubated in medium or medium supplemented with TPCK ( 100 M ) for 1 h before stimulation with PMA/ionomycin for the times indicated .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and assessed for kB binding activity by EMSA .
B , With the same samples used in A , cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting for IxBa expression .
C , The same cells as described in A were examined after 24 h for DNA breaks by TUNEL .
These findings point to a critical role of NF-KB family members in the protection of cells against various forms of apoptotic cell death .
The data presented here shows that blocking nuclear translocation of NF-kB dimers by the cell-permeable peptide , SN50 , induced apoptosis in normal peripheral blood-derived T lymphocytes .
In contrast , the inactive control SN50 M mutant peptide had no inhibitory effect on either « B binding activity or cell viability .
Whether suppression of NF- « B activation is responsible for the initiation of apoptosis in peripheral T cells is supported by the observation that , at the SN50 concentration of 37.5 pug/m ! , induction of apoptosis coincided with selective suppression of kB binding activity as evident by normal nuclear localization of other transcription factors , such as AP-1 and NF-AT .
This conclusion is also supported by the fact that suppression of NF- « B activation by another mechanism ( TPCK ) also induced DNA breaks .

for 2 h before the addition of 75 ug/ml SNS5O peptide .
The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined after 24 h by TUNEL staining .
INHIBITION OF NF- « B INDUCES APOPTOSIS OF T CELLS Given the finding that SN5O-mediated apoptosis was observed in resting T cells leaves open the possibility that low levels of constitutive « B binding activity are required to maintain cellular viability in this lymphoid population .
As noted by Western blotting and by gel mobility shifts assays ( Figs .
7 and 8 ) ( 60 ) , there are low levels of NF- « B1 and RelA expression in the nucleus without any external stimulation .
The fact that SN50 blocked nuclear translocation of p50 and RelA and subsequently induced apoptosis is consistent with the possibility that the constitutive expression of NF- « B in resting T cells promotes survival .
Susceptibility of T cells to apoptosis appears to be linked to the state of their activation .
This conclusion is supported by previously published data that shows mitogen activation of T cells enhances their resistance to y-irradiation ( 56 ) .
In agreement with this idea , our study shows that preactivation of naive T cells with either PMA/ionomycin or IL-2 completely blocked DNA fragmentation induced by SN50 peptide .
Cells needed to be preactivated for at least 2 h before their exposure to SN50 peptide to become resistant to SN5O0-mediated apoptosis .
The kinetics of induction of resistance paralleled the appearance of xB DNA binding activity ( our unpublished observations ) .
It may be that NF-KB activation results in transcriptional up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in protection against apoptosis .
The protective product may be distinct from Bel-2 , since SN50 inhibited NF-KB activation and induced apoptosis even in the presence of significant levels of Bcl-2 .
Whether overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins , such as Bcl-x , , , can protect T cells from apoptosis induced by blocking NF- « B nuclear translocation is currently under investigation .
Activation of caspase proteases was previously shown to be required for the induction of apoptosis in different cell types ( 21-30 ) .
Our findings with the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Ac-DEVD-fmk are consistent with the possibility that SN50-mediated apoptosis in T cells is caspase-dependent .
However , there appears to be a difference in either the level or types of caspases induced as a consequence of NF- « B suppression by SN50 peptide when compared with other inducers of apoptosis , such as TPEN or FasL .
In contrast to FasL or TPEN , the SN50 peptide did not induce detectable enzymatic activity of caspase-l- , caspase-3- , or caspase-6-like proteases using fluorogenic peptide substrates , YVAD-AMC , DEVD-AMC , and VEID-AMC , respectively .
Although both caspase-1 and caspase-3 were constitutively expressed in precursor forms , we did not detect processed subunits of these proteins in lysates from T cells treated with SN50 peptide , further suggesting they were not activated by SN50 .
In support of this conclusion is the observation that no proteolytic cleavage of either PARP or DFF-45 , well-established substrates for caspase-3 , was detected in T cells treated with SN50 peptide .
These data suggest that caspase-1 , caspase-3 , and caspase-6 may not be the primary caspases required for apoptosis induced by inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation in T cells .
Additional studies are needed to identify the caspase pathway involved in SN5O-mediated apoptosis .
In certain pathological conditions , such as cancer , down-regu-lation of NF-B activity may represent a mechanism for inhibiting the development of T cell immune responses .
Impaired activation of NF-KB has been reported in T cells derived from tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients ( 60 , 61 ) .
Furthermore , products present in the tumor environment , such as IL-10 , gangliosides , and prosta-glandin E ; , are known to inhibit NF- « B activation and down-reg-ulate immune responses ( 62-64 ) .
The blocking of NF-KB translocation may make T cells more susceptible to apoptosis .
The evidence presented here suggests that the prevention of nuclear expression of NF-kB dimers can induce apoptosis in T lymphocytes .
