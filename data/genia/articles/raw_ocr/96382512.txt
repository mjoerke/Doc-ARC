Birnstiel , Research Institute of Molecular Pathology , Vienna , Austria , June 3 , 1996 ( received for review February 19 , 1996 ) ABSTRACT Self renewal of normal erythroid progenitors is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase c-ErbB , whereas other receptors ( c-Kit/Epo-R ) regulate erythroid differentiation .
To address possible mechanisms that could explain this selective activity of c-ErbB , we analyzed the ability of these receptors to activate the different members of the Stat transcription factor family .
Ligand activation of c-ErbB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation , DNA-binding , and reporter gene transcription of Stat 5b in erythroblasts .
In contrast , ligand activation of c-Kit was unable to induce any of these effects in the same cells .
Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b , but failed to induce reporter gene transcription .
These biochemical findings correlate perfectly with the selective ability of c-ErbB to cause sustained self renewal in erythroid progenitors .
The balance between proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors is of crucial importance for both normal and abnormal hematopoiesis ( for review , see ref .
1 ) .
Recently , the ability to cultivate normal chicken erythroid progenitors in vitro provided a system that allows a molecular analysis of how growth factors regulate this balance .
In these committed erythroid progenitors , the erythropoietin receptor ( EpoR ) in cooperation with the insulin receptor regulates erythroid differentiation .
In addition , these cells express the receptor tyrosine kinases c-Kit and c-ErbB .
Activation of the c-Kit receptor by its ligand stem cell factor ( SCF ) only induces a transient proliferation of these progenitors .
In contrast , activation of the c-ErbB/avian epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor by its ligand type a transforming growth factor ( TGF-a ) induces sustained cell proliferation and inhibits differentiation ( referred to as `` self-renewal '' ; refs .
2-4 ) .
Activation of a self-renewal program in committed progenitors may be a central mechanism that controls homeostasis in hematopoiesis and may be a likely target for leukemogenic mutations .
Thus , our cell system may provide a unique opportunity to analyzed the underlying mechanisms by which progenitor self-renewal can be controlled .
Recently , we observed that c-Kit and c-ErbB activate distinct , but so far unidentified , downstream signaling pathways ( O.W. , G.M. , M. Von Lindern , A. Levitzky , A. Gazit , J. Jschenko , M.J.H. , and H.B. , unpublished work ) .
Thus , receptor specific signal transduction must contribute to the differential ability of c-Kit and c-ErbB to induce self-renewal .
The purpose of the studies reported here was to identify downstream signaling molecules that could potentially be involved in this differential regulation of committed progenitor self-renewal .
One rapidly growing family of candidate signaling proteins that could be involved are the Stat ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .

§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
9600 scription factors reside in the cytoplasm , and their tyrosine phosphorylation , dimerization , and nuclear localization are induced by various ligands of receptor tyrosine kinases ( 5-8 ) .
Stat 1 was first identified as a component of interferon activated transcription factors ( 9 ) .
As a homodimer , the protein binds to a DNA sequence designated interferon y-activated site ( GAS ) ( 10 ) .
Stat 1 can also be activated by EGF and platelet-derived growth factor to bind to a sis conditioned medium-inducible ( SIE ) element ( 11-14 ) .
EGF- or platelet-derived growth factor-activated Stat 1 can bind to DNA as a homodimer or form heterodimers with another Stat family member , Stat 3 , which is also phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to EGF or platelet-derived growth factor .
These growth factors thus cause the formation of Stat 1 and Stat 3 homodimers and of the Stat 1-Stat 3 heterodimers ( 15 , 16 ) .
The third Stat recently implicated in a receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is Stat 5 .
This protein , originally described as a prolactin responsive transcription factor in mammary gland epithelium ( for review , see ref .
17 ) , was recently found to be activated by a number of hematopoietic growth factor receptors ( 18-23 ) .
Injection of EGF into mice also caused the DNA-binding and phosphorylation of a Stat 5-like protein in liver ( 7 ) .
In summary , this family of transcription factors is activated by numerous cytokines and receptor tyrosine kinases .
Thus , it represents a potential means by which c-Kit and c-ErbB could regulate the expression of distinct target genes , leading to the differential regulation of progenitor self-renewal .
In this paper , we have examined the potential of various members of the Stat family to transduce signals emanating from c-ErbB and c-Kit as well as from the EpoR in erythroblasts .
We demonstrate that TGF-a , but not SCF , causes efficient phosphorylation and DNA-binding of Stat 5b , one of two closely related Stat 5 proteins ( 24 ) .
TGF-a also causes transactivation of reporter genes carrying high affinity Stat 5 binding sites ( IFP53-GAS ) ( 25 ) .
In contrast , the EpoR causes specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b , but fails to induce transactivation of respective reporter genes .
These data implicate Stat 5b in playing a role in regulating self-renewal versus differentiation in erythroid progenitors .

expresses endogenous , bioactive c-Kit and c-ErbB , and an exogenous murine EpoR ( 28 ) .
The ts-v-ErbB oncoprotein expressed by this cell line is fully inactivated by the ErbB-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( PD 153035 ; ref .
29 ; see below ) or by shift to the nonpermissive temperature ( 42°C ) .
V-ErbA , the second oncoprotein of HD3 , is also inactive in presence of PD 153035 , since it requires the presence of activated receptor tyrosine kinases ( A. Bauer , E. Ulrich , M. Andersson , H.B. , and M. Von Lindern , unpublished work ) .
Under these conditions , the HD3E22 cell line behaves similar to the normal erythroid progenitors .
Growth Factor Treatment and Cell Lysis .
For growth-factor stimulation , HD3E22 cells were washed once with PBS and then withdrawn from factors by cultivation for 12 hr in differentiation medium ( 30 ) , using 2.5 uM PD153035 to inhibit v-ErbB/v-ErbA activity .
PD 153035 abolishes ligand-induced c-ErbB autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of c-ErbB substrates , but has no respective effects on many other receptors , including c-Kit , InsR , IGF-1R , II-3R , and EpoR .
In addition , PD 153035 specifically abolishes self-renewal induction in erythroid progenitors by TGF-a activated c-ErbB , but does not affect proliferation/differentiation induction by ligand-activated c-Kit or EpoR in the same cells ( G. M. and H.B. , unpublished work ) .
Cells were washed twice with PBS , suspended in differentiation medium , and treated either with or without 50 ng/ml TGF-a « , 1 ug/ml SCF , and 20 units/ml human recombinant Epo for 15 min at 42°C .
Control experiments showed that this procedure did not affect ligand-induced autophosphorylation of c-ErbB , c-Kit , or EpoR , but effectively abolished autophosphorylation of the 68-74 kDa v-ErbB protein during the course of the experiment .
Stimulation of primary SCF/TGF- « progenitors was performed similar except that the cells did not receive the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 during factor withdrawal and were not shifted to 42°C .
After stimulation , 1 X 108 cells were lysed either in 10 ul electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) lysis buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9/140 mM NaCl/1.5 mM MgCl ; /1.0 % Nonidet P-40/1 mM sodium orthovanadate/10 pg/ml aprotinin/2 ug/ml leupeptin ) or in 20 ul immunoprecipitation buffer ( 1 % Triton X-100/50 mM TrissHCl , pH 8.0/100 mM NaCl/1 mM sodium orthovanadate/10 ug/ml aprotinin/2 ug/ml leu-peptin ) .
Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm before use .
Antibodies .
Antibodies to mammalian ISGF3 and Stat 3 cross-reacting with the respective chicken proteins were obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories ( anti-ISGF3 , catalog no .
G16920 ) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( anti-Stat 3 ; K-15 % , catalog no .
sc-483X ) .
Antibodies against the Stat 1 C terminus were kindly provided by Chris Schindler ( Columbia University , New York ) .
Antibodies raised in rabbits against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with the huStat 5b C terminus or a peptide corresponding to the huStat 5a C terminus are described in detail elsewhere ( A.M. , F. Barahmand-pour , S. Wohrl , D. Stoiber , and T.D. , unpublished work ) .
Immunoprecipitation .
Immunoprecipitation of Stat 5b protein was done according to ref .
31 with some modifications .
Cell lysate ( 100 wl ) was incubated with 2 ul concentrated Stat 5b specific antibody for 12 hr at 4°C in 300 wl immunoprecipitation buffer .
Immune complexes were collected by protein A-Sepharose , run on an 8 % SDS/PAGE , and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( DuPont ) .
The Western blot was probed first with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 , Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) and then reprobed with the Stat 5b specific antibody .
Oligonucleotides .
For gel-shift experiments and competi-tions , the following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used ( the top strands are shown for all GAS elements ) : IFP 53 , 5-GATCAAGTGTTTCTGAGAATCTGGGTGATT-3 ' ; Ly6A/E , 5-GATCAATTTATGCATATTCCTGTAAGT- Proc .

Mobility-Shift and Super-Shift Analyses .
To measure specific complex formation of Stat proteins with DNA , the double-stranded oligonucleotides described above were labeled with radio-labeled deoxynucleotides by filling in the ends with Klenow polymerase .
The protein binding reaction was performed as described ( 32 ) , using a buffer containing 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , 250 ng/ml poly ( dI-dC ) , and 1 mM sodium orthovana-date for 30 min .
For super-shift experiments , the different antibodies were added for the last 10 min of the binding reaction ( final dilution of 1:100 for the Stat 5a , Stat 5b , and Stat 1C specific antisera , 1 ug of purified immunoglobulins in case of the ISGF3 and Stat 3 antibodies ) Transient Expression of Reporter Gene Constructs .
HD3E22 cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine reagents ( Life Technologies Grand Island , NY ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
For transfection , 3.2 ug reporter DNA constructs ( 25 ) and 10 ul Lipofectamine reagents were mixed and preincubated , and the complex added to 1 x 10 '' cells .
After incubation for 4 hr , the cells were further cultivated in differentiation medium containing TGF-a , SCF , or no factor for 24 hr .
After incubation , cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thaw in 0.25 M Tris ( pH 7.5 ) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays were performed as described ( 33 ) .
Transfection efficiency was assessed by cotransfection of a reporter plasmid consisting of a luciferase gene under the control of a Rous sarcoma virus promoter or , in some experiments , by a plasmid containing a Rous sarcoma virus promoter driven B-galactosidase gene using a chemiluminescence substrate ( Tropix , Bedford , MA ) .
CAT activities obtained were normalized to transfection effi-ciencies as well as cell numbers .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Signaling from ErbB Causes Formation of Specific Stat/ DNA Complexes .
Activation of Stat proteins gives rise to the formation of specific DNA-binding complexes that recognize a specific oligonucleotide sequence known as GAS element .
Thus , as an initial step in identifying Stat proteins activated by c-ErbB and/or c-Kit after addition of ligand , extracts from SCF- or TGF-a-treated HD3E22 erythroblasts ( used here since they tolerate growth factor withdrawal much better than primary erythroblasts , see Materials and Methods ) were analyzed in gel-shift assays ( EMSA ) for the formation of specific complexes with a number of different GAS-related DNA elements .
These different GAS elements are selective for various Stat family members .
As shown in Fig .
14 , cell extracts from TGF-a-treated HD3E22 cells contained proteins that bound to the IFP-53 GAS element ( 25 ) , but not to Ly6A/E .
A weak but TGF-a specific binding to SIE-M67 and APRE sequences could be detected ( sequences are defined in Materials and Methods ) .
In contrast to TGF- « , treatment with SCF or no growth factor failed to give rise to DNA-binding complexes with IFP-53 GAS or the other elements in HD3E22 cell extracts .
_ Next , we repeated these experiments in primary erythroid progenitors , using cells expressing either endogenous c-Kit and c-ErbB ( SCF/TGF-a progenitors ; ref .
2 ) or high endogenous c-Kit levels together with exogenous c-ErbB encoded by an avian retrovirus vector ( 26 ) .
Activation of c-ErbB caused a similar , specific DNA-binding of Stat proteins as with the HD3E22 cell line ( data not shown ) .
In the SCF/TGF- @ progenitors , some background DNA complex formation was obtained both without any factor and in the presence of SCF .
In conclusion , this c-ErbB specific activation of a Stat/DNA 9602 Cell Biology : Mellitzer et al .

Mobility-shift analysis , oligonucleotide competition assay , and antibody interference mobility-shift assay of TGF- « - or SCF-induced HD3E22 cells .
( 4 ) Cell extracts prepared from HD3E22 treated for 15 min with TGF-a or SCF or left untreated ( - ) were analyzed by EMSA using four different *°P-labeled oligonucleotides ( IFP53-GAS , Ly6A/E-GAS , APRE , or M67-SIE ; see text ) .
( B ) Extracts from TGF-a-induced cells were assayed in the mobility-shift assay as above , using a labeled IFP53-GAS probe .
The reaction was competed with a 20- , 100- , and 200-fold excess of the indicated nonradioactive oligonucleotides .
The position of the specific Stat/DNA complexes formed is indicated by arrows .
( C ) HD3E22 cells were treated with factors , extracted , and subjected to the mobility-shift assay using the IFP53-GAS probe as described for 4 .
Incubation of the Stat/DNA complexes with various antibodies to different Stat proteins was done as described .

complex has the desired properties of a signal transduction pathway involved in self-renewal induction .
To directly demonstrate that the c-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase was responsible for Stat activation , we used a c-ErbB-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( PD 153035 ) .
PD 153035 prevents ligand-induced autophosphorylation of c-ErbB and activation of c-ErbB substrates , but has no effect on signal transduction by all other receptors tested ( see Materials and Methods ; G.M .
and H.B. , unpublished work ) .
When added to HD3E22 cells during c-ErbB activation by TGF-a , complex formation of Stats with the IFP-53 element was completely inhibited ( data not shown ) .
To determine the specificity of the IFP-53 bound protein complex , we tried to compete complex formation with an excess of unlabeled DNA of all four GAS elements .
Consistent with the data shown in Fig .
14 , only the IFP-53 GAS element effectively competed complex formation of proteins from TGF-a-stimulated erythroblast ( Fig .
1B ) .
The next best competitor was the APRE element .
The two other elements were either unable to compete ( such as the Ly6A/E , which is a Stat 1-binding site ) , or competed only at high concentrations ( like the SIE-M67 probe ) .
These poorly competing sites are strongly recognized by Stat 3 and Stat 1 ( 12 , 15 , 34-36 ) .
Since the IFP-53 GAS predominantly binds Stat 5 ( 32 , 37 , 38 ) , these results suggested that a Stat 5-like protein is present in the specific DNA/protein complexes induced by TGF-a in erythroblasts .
Stat 5b Is Present in the DNA-Binding Complex .
Having demonstrated the formation of a specific DNA-binding complex by activation of c-ErbB , we wanted to identify the Stat proteins present in the DNA-binding complexes .
This was done by testing various antibodies for their ability to cause a super shift of the DNA bound protein complexes in the EMSA assay .
We used antibodies that were able to specifically super shift Stat 1 , Stat 3 , Stat 5a , or Stat 5b complexes in suitable extracts from mammalian cells ( A.M. , F. Barahmand-pour , S. Wohrl , D. Stoiber , and T.D. , unpublished work ) .
These antibodies also detected proteins with the expected molecular weights of Stat 1a , Stat 18 , Stat 3 , Stat 5a , and Stat 5b in Western blots from both primary erythroblasts and from the HD3E22 cell line , demonstrating their ability to cross react with the respective chicken Stat proteins ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
1C , antibodies to Stat 1 , Stat 3 , or Stat 5a were unable to super shift the TGF-a « -induced DNA/protein complex .
In contrast , the antibody directed against Stat 5b induced a complete super shift of this complex , giving rise to the formation of two distinct , larger complexes .
It remains unclear why the Stat 5b antibody induced super shift results in two bands .
One possibility is that the antibody cross-linked two Stat homodimer DNA complexes in the upper band .
The fact that none of the antibodies to Stat 1 caused a super shift of the TGF-a induced DNA/protein complex is in line with the earlier finding that no TGF- @ -induced complexes were obtained with high-affinity Stat 1-binding sites , e.g. , the Ly6A/E GAS ( Fig .
14 ) .
c-ErbB is the chicken equivalent of the mammalian EGF receptor ( 39 ) .
The mammalian receptor has been shown to activate Stat 1 and Stat 3 in certain cell types ( 15 , 16 ) and ( directly or indirectly ) causes Stat 5 activation in rat liver ( 7 ) .
As described above , chicken erythroblasts express all three Stat proteins ( Stat 1 , Stat 3 , and Stat 5 ; data not shown ) .
Therefore , it is surprising that Stat 5 seems to be selectively activated by c-ErbB in this cell system .
Except for potential cell type specific mechanisms , we have no explanation for this selective activation seen in chicken cells .
TGF-a « Induction of Stat 5b Allows Transcriptional Activation of an IFPS3-GAS Promoter CAT Construct .
The specific binding of Stat 5b to DNA in response to TGF-a @ already indicates that Stat 5b may be involved in the activation of TGF- « -induced genes .
To clarify if Stat 5b activation by c-ErbB would cause transcription of reporter genes containing Stat 5-specific DNA elements , erythroid cells were transfected with a CAT reporter construct that contained either two or three copies of the IFP53-GAS element , respectively .
To be able to normalize for transfection efficiency , a construct Cell Biology : Mellitzer et al .
expressing the luciferase gene under the control of a Rous sarcoma virus promoter was cotransfected .
The transfected cells were treated with TGF-a or , as controls , with SCF or no growth factor .
Extracts were prepared and the CAT activity of respective cell extracts was then determined .
TGF-a treatment resulted in a 3- to 4-fold induction of CAT activity , while SCF-treated cells expressed CAT levels that were even lower than in the untreated control cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Similar results were obtained in four other experiments , yielding up to 20-fold stimulation of CAT activity by ligand activated c-ErbB when an improved method for determining transfection efficiency was used ( data not shown ) .
Thus , activation of c-ErbB is sufficient to cause transactivation of IFP53-GAS-regulated reporter genes , indicating that signals originating from this receptor tyrosine kinase produce a transcriptionally active Stat 5 dimer .
The resulting Stat 5b-specific gene expression could play an important role in the induction of self-renewal by c-ErbB .
Ligand Activation of ErbB Causes Tyrosine Phosphorylation of a 92 kDa Stat 5b Protein .
The binding of Stat proteins to DNA is dependent on their tyrosine phosphorylation ( 6 ) .
To analyze whether Stat 5 proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of c-ErbB , HD3E22 cells were treated with TGF-a or SCF or left untreated .
Extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a Stat 5b antibody , followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody .
As shown in Fig .
3 , TGF- « activated c-ErbB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein doublet with molecular masses of 91-92 kDa that was specifically immunoprecipitated by a Stat 5b antibody .
No such phosphorylated proteins were detected in the SCF-treated cells or in the controls .
Reprobing of the Western blot with the Stat 5b specific antibody showed that equal amounts of Stat 5b protein were immunoprecipitated under all conditions ( Fig .
3 ) .
Again , these results could be reproduced in normal c-Kit/c-ErbB expressing erythroid progenitors ( data not shown ) .
The two bands detected by our antibody may represent full-length and short versions of Stat 5 recently found in mammalian myeloid cells ( 18 ) .
Trials to demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of other Stat proteins by c-ErbB or c-Kit in either HD3E22 cells or primary erythroblasts met with limited success .
Using a Stat la/B antibody ( anti ISGF-3 antibody ) that cross-reacts with several Stat proteins , a 91 kDa protein was found to be phosphorylated in response to TGF- « , whereas a 84 kDa protein was similarly phosphorylated in response to TGF- « and SCF ( data not 25000 7 > .

shown ) .
The identity of the latter protein and the reason for its inability to produce a gel shift with the Stat 1 DNA elements used remains unclear .
Our results indicate that ligand-activated c-ErbB that causes sustained self-renewal in erythroid progenitors specifically activates Stat 5b proteins by causing their tyrosine phosphorylation , specific binding to DNA , and activation of reporter gene transcription .
In contrast , activation of c-Kit does not lead to the formation of Stat/DNA complexes and also does not induce sustained self-renewal .
However , it remains unclear whether c-Kit is incapable of activating the Stat pathway , since it could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-like targets , but was unable to cause binding of such proteins to DNA .
The Activated EpoR Causes DNA Binding but Not Transactivation by Stat 5b .
Our results raise the obvious question , how cytokine receptors known to activate Stat 5b in other cell types ( see Introduction ) would behave in our cells with respect to Stat 5b activation and induction of self-renewal .
This question is difficult to address in chicken cells , since most known cytokines or their receptors are not available as recombinant proteins .
Recently , however , we could show that the murine EpoR is able to trigger normal , terminal erythroid differentiation if expressed in primary or established chicken erythroblasts ( 28 ) .
The EpoR activates Stat 5 proteins in mammalian nonerythroid cell lines ( 20 , 22 ) .
We therefore analyzed if activation of the murine EpoR expressed in the HD3E22 cell line was able to cause DNA-binding of and transactivation by Stat 5b .
Extracts from HD3E22 cells treated with human recombinant Epo or left untreated were analyzed for complex formation with the Stat S-specific IFP-53 GAS element .
In addition , antibodies to different Stat proteins were tested for their ability to super shift the Epo-induced complexes .

The activated EpoR induces Stat 5b binding to DNA but fails to cause transactivation .
( 4 ) Cell extracts were prepared from HD3E22 cells after a 15-min treatment with Epo or no growth factor ( - ) , and examined by mobility-shift assay using a labeled IFP53-GAS probe .
Incubation of the Stat/DNA complexes with antibodies to different Stat proteins was done as described for Fig .

Lower arrow , Stat 5b/DNA complex ; upper arrow , Stat 5b DNA complex super shifted by anti-Stat 5b antibody .
( B ) HD3E22 cells were transfected with a CAT reporter gene construct containing three ( IFP-3 ) IFP53-GAS elements and grown for 24 hr in the presence of the indicated growth factors ( Epo , TGF-a , or no growth factor ) .
CAT activity in cell extracts was plotted after normalization for transfection efficiency and cell number .
The results of two independent experiments are indicated ( 1 , 2 ) .
EpoR induced the formation of a specific DNA/protein complex that could be super shifted by the Stat 5b antibody .
Thus , similar to c-ErbB , the EpoR can induce DNA-binding of Stat 5b .
Interestingly , however , activation of the EpoR failed to induce transactivation of a IFP53-GAS regulated reporter gene , whereas activated c-ErbB used as a positive control resulted in a 10-fold stimulation of CAT activity ( Fig .
4B ) .
Thus , the activity of Stat proteins is probably regulated at multiple levels , not only by tyrosine phosphorylation causing DNA-binding , but also by other events ( e.g. , serine phosphor-ylation ; ref .
40 ) necessary for transactivation .
In conclusion , ligand activation of c-ErbB specifically activates DNA-binding and transcriptional activation by Stat 5b and thus presumably gives rise to the activation of gene Proc .

The activation of Stat 5b by c-ErbB clearly correlated with its ability to activate self-renewal , since two other receptors , c-Kit and EpoR , failed to cause transactivation by Stat 5b and were unable to induce sustained proliferation .
Future studies will be necessary to determine if this activation is necessary and/or sufficient to activate self-renewal , to identify the genes that are activated by this Stat complex and to determine their role in self-renewal induction .
