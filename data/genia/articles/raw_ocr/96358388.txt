Summary Although case-oriented evidence for an association of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) with gastric carcinoma has been accumulating recently , the interaction ( s ) between EBV and gastric epithelial cells is/are largely unknown .
In this study , we examined seven EBV-positive gastric carcinoma tissues for viral gene expression at the mRNA level , from which studies on the EBV oncogenicity in human epithelial cells will benefit .
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that all seven EBV-positive tumour tissues constitutively expressed EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) 1 mRNA , but not EBNA2 mRNA .
The EBNA transcription was initiated from one of three EBNA promoters , Qp ; by contrast , both Cp and Wp were silent , thus resulting in the lack of EBNA2 mRNA .
Latent membrane protein ( LMP ) 2A mRNA was detected in three of seven cases ; however , neither LMP ] nor LMP2B mRNA was detected in any of the tumours tested .
Transcripts from the BamHI-A region of the viral genome were detectable in all cases .
BZLFI mRNA and the product , an immediate-early gene for EBV replication , was not expressed in any of them , thereby suggesting that the tumour cells carried EBV genomes in a tightly latent form .
These findings further extended our previous data regarding EBV latency in gastric carcinoma cells at the protein level , and have affirmed that the programme of viral gene expression in the tumour more closely resembles 'latency I ' represented by Burkitt 's lymphoma than 'latency II represented by the majority of nasopharyngeal carcinomas .
Keywords : Epstein-Barr virus ; gastric carcinoma ; Epstein-Barr virus-specific mRNA ; reverse transcription ( RT ) -polymerase chain reaction analysis Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a ubiquitous human herpes virus , closely associated with the genesis of Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) , undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) and opportunistic lymphomas in immunocompro-mised hosts ( Liebowitz and Kieff , 1993 ) .
Recent studies demonstrated that EBV is also implicated in Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) ( Herbst et a/. , 1991 ; Pallesen et a/. , 1991 ) , certain T-cell lymphomas ( Harabuchi et al. , 1990 ; Su et al. , 1991 ; Korbjuhn et al. , 1993 ) and thymic carcinoma ( Leyvraz et al. , 1985 ; Dimery et al. , 1988 ; Patton et al. , 1994 ) .
All or a significant proportion of neoplastic cells of the tumours harbour EBV DNA and express virus-coded latent infection ( immortalisation-associated ) proteins .
Some of these EBV-related malignancies have been precisely analysed for viral latent gene expression and show characteristic patterns for each individual tumour ( Liebowitz and Kieff , 1993 ) .
Over ten major EBV genes are known to be potentially transcribed in cells latently infected with the virus : EBV nuclear antigens ( EBNA ) 1 , -2 , -3A , -3B , -3C and leader protein ( LP ) ; latent membrane proteins ( LMP ) 1 , -2A , and 2B ; untranslated EBV-encoded small RNAs ( EBER ) -1 and -2 ( Liebowitz and Kieff , 1993 ) ; and a recently found transcript containing the BamHI-A rightward open reading frame ( BARFO ) ( Gilligan et al. , 1990 ) .
All the latent transcripts are regularly expressed in in vitro EBV-immortalised B-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) and some B lymphoproliferative disorders occurring in immunosuppressed patients ( latency III ) ( Young et al. , 1989 ; Kerr et al. , 1992 ) .
In contrast , only EBERs , EBNA1 and BamHI-A transcripts are expressed in most in vivo BL cells and several BL cell lines ( latency I ) , which are referred to as group I BL cells ( Rowe et al. , 1987 ; Brooks et al. , 1993 ) ; and three LMP genes are additionally expressed along with EBERs , EBNAL and BamHI-A RNAs in the majority of NPC and HD ( latency II ) cases ( Kerr et al. , 1992 ; Deacon et al. , 1993 ) .
Correspondence : S Imai Received 21 September 1995 ; revised 6 February 1996 ; accepted 13 March 1996 Furthermore , the combination of EBNA mRNA expressed depends on which of three mutually exclusive EBNA promoters , BamHI-C , -W and -Q promoters ( Cp , Wp and Qp respectively ) , is active .
The Cp- or Wp-initiated large primary transcript is differentially spliced into all six EBNA mRNAs as is seen in cells with latency III ( e.g LCL ) ( Rogers et al. , 1990 ) , whereas Qp mediates the selective expression of only EBNA1 mRNA through bypassing coding regions of the other EBNA genes , consequently leading to the complete lack of EBNA2 , -3A , -3B , -3C and -LP mRNAs represented by group I BL and NPC cells ( Schaefer et al. , 19954 ; Nonkwelo et al. , 1996 ) .
Gastric carcinoma , the most common malignancy in Japan , is being recognised as one of the EBV-related tumours ( Shibata et al. , 1991 ; Imai et al. , 1994 ) .
Although our previous work revealed that about 7 % of Japanese gastric carcinomas were EBV genome-positive and that , in addition to EBERs , EBNA1 , but not the other EBNAs or LMP1 , protein was expressed in the tumour cells ( Imai et aZ. , 1994 ) , details about expression of the other latent genes , LMP2A , -2B and BARFO , and about utilisation of an EBNA promoter , which is also necessary to understand the EBV-induced oncogenic process , are still unknown .
In this study , we analysed seven EBV-positive gastric carcinomas more extensively for virus latent and replication cycle gene expression together with EBNA promoter usage at the mRNA level , using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) technique .
Materials and methods Subjects Tumour tissues used in this study were resected or endoscopically biopsied from the stomachs of seven patients with EBV-positive gastric carcinoma and six patients with EBV-negative gastric carcinoma .
The clinical and histological data of the patients with EBV-positive gastric carcinoma are shown in Table I .
The six EBV-negative tumours consisted of two well differentiated , two moderately differentiated and two EBV gene expression in gastric carcinoma M Sugiura et al 626 poorly differentiated histological types .
EBV positivity of the cases was screened by the PCR assay for EBV DNA and in situ hybridisation for EBER1 as previously described ( Imai et al. , 1994 ) .
All tumour specimens were snap frozen and stored at -80°C until use .
They were obtained after informed consent of the patients and used according to the guidelines of the Committee for Experimentation and Protection of Human Subjects , Cancer Institute , Hokkaido University School of Medicine .
Cell lines All cell lines used were maintained in the exponential growth phase in RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum .
An EBV-transformed LCL was used as a positive control for detection of EBNA1I , -2 , LMP1 , -2A , -2B mRNAs ; Cp- and Wp-initiated EBNA mRNAs ; and BamHI-A transcripts .
A group I BL cell line , Akata ( Takada and Ono , 1989 ) , served as a positive control for Qp-initiated EBNA mRNA .
For detection of the EBV replication-associated BZLF !

A B-lymphoma cell line , BJAB , was used as an EBV-negative control ( Klein et al. , 1975 ) .
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis RNA extraction was carried out within one month of the storage period .
After pulverisation of the frozen tissues in a micro-homogeniser , total RNA was extracted by using Trizol reagent ( Gibco BRL , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol , precipitated with isopropanol in the pressence of 1 ug of glycogen ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) .
The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 15 000 r.p.m .
for 15 min , washed twice with ice-cold 75 % ethanol , dried and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) -treated distilled water .

To test the sensitivity of our RT-PCR system , RNA was prepared from 10° appropriate control cells , serially 10-fold diluted from a quantity equivalent to 10° to 10° cells , and the total RNA amount of each diluted sample was adjusted to that of 10° cells by addition of RNA extracted from BJAB cells .
For cDNA synthesis , 10 pmol of a 3'-primer specific for each transcript ( Table II ) was added to the RNA sample , followed by heating at 94°C for 5 min and rapid chilling on ice .
Reagents were added to the RNA primer mixture to give a final concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 8.3 ) , 75 mM potassium chloride , 3 mM magnesium chloride , 10 mM dithiothreitol , 0.5 mm for each dNTP , 10 U of RNasin ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) and 200 U of Molony murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Gibco BRL ) .
Reverse transcription was performed at 37°C for 60 min in a total volume of 20 ul and then heated at 94°C for 3 min to stop the reaction .
PCR and detection of amplified products Full details of the sequences and genome coordinates of primers and probes used to detect EBV transcripts are given in Table II .
Our original primer pairs were designed in different exons for individual EBV transcripts so that occasional amplification of contaminated genomic DNA , if any , could be easily discriminated from the relevant RNA amplification by product size .
The PCR reaction mixture consisted of 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.4 ) , 50 mm potassium chloride , 1.5 mM magnesium chloride , 0.01 % gelatin , 200 um of each dNTP , 20 pmol of each primer and synthesised -- -EBNA1 for Mc ?

After it was overlaid with mineral oil , the reaction mixture was heated to 94°C for 3 min , slowly cooled to 70°C , and then 2.5 U of Tag polymerase ( Gibco BRL ) was added to the tubes .
Samples were then subjected to 35 cycles of amplification by a Thermal Cycler 480 ( Perkin-Elmer , Foster City , CA , USA ) , each cycle consisting of 94°C for 1 min ( denaturation ) , 45°C for 2 min ( annealing ) and 72°C for 3 min ( DNA extension ) .
The extension time was prolonged to 6 min in the last cycle .
The quality of RNA preparations was simultaneously checked by 30 cycles of amplification of cytoplasmic B-actin mRNA with the antisense primer ( 5-GGAGCAAT-GATCITGATCTTC-3 ' ) and the sense primer ( 5'-CCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCT-3 ' ) ( Busson et al. , 1992 ) .
The PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5 % agarose gels ( SeaKem ; Takara , Otsu , Japan ) , stained with ethidium bromide ( Et-Br ) , and photographed under a UV-transillumi-nator .
They were denatured in an alkali solution for 20 min with gentle rocking and directly blotted onto nylon membranes ( Biodyne-B ; Pall , Glen Cove , NY , USA ) by vacuum transfer .
The blotted membranes were fixed with a UV-crosslinker ( Bio Rad , Richmond , CA , USA ) and then subjected to hybridisation with [ y-P ] JATP-S'-end-labelled internal oligonucleotide probes .
The exposure time of autoradiograph was 6-12 h for viral transcripts and 2 h for B-actin mRNA .

Results Sensitivity of RT-PCR In preliminary experiments using diluted RNA samples from a reference LCL , the RT-PCR -Southern hybridisation system with our original primer-probe combinations could detect EBNA1 ( with U/K exons ) , EBNA2 , LMP ! 1 , BARFO and Cp-initiated EBNA transcripts as well as LMP2A and -2B mRNAs amplified with the primers previously reported ( Brooks et a/. , 1992 ) , even at the single-cell level ( data not shown ) .
Wp- and Qp-initiated EBNA and BZLFI mRNAs were detectable at RNA amounts equivalent to 10 LCL , untreated and slg-crosslinked Akata cells respectively ( data not shown ) .
Thus , our RT-PCR systems were considered to have sensitivities similar to or higher than those described in other RNA studies on NPC and HD ( Brooks et al. , 1992 ; Deacon et al. , 1993 ) .
RT-PCR analysis of EBV latent gene expression in EBV-positive gastric carcinomas RT-PCR analyses revealed that EBNAl mRNA with BamHI-U and -K exons , which are commonly contained in every EBNA1 transcript generated from any of the three EBNA promoters , could be clearly detected in all seven EBV-positive gastric carcinoma tissues ( Figure 1 ) .
By contrast , none of the tumour tissues expressed either detectable EBNA2 or LMP !
mRNA , whereas the RNA preparation from control LCL yielded strong signals and $ -actin mRNA was readily amplified from all tumour tissues tested ( Figure 1 ) .
The results were consistent with our previous observations at the protein level ( Imai et al. , 1994 ) .
We further investigated expression of LMP2A , -2B and BamHI-A transcripts in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma , which remain unknown so far .
As shown in Figure 2 , LMP2A mRNA was detected in three of the seven cases , although LMP2B mRNA was undetectable in all cases .
Transcripts from the BamHI-A fragment of the virus genomes were also detected in all seven cases studied ( Figure 2 ) .
Based on the above results , the EBV latent gene expression pattern in gastric carcinoma is delineated in Table III , in comparison with the other representative EBV-positive cell types .
No mRNA investigated except for B-actin was detected in six EBV-negative gastric carcinoma tissues throughout the present study ( Figure 1 and see below ) .
Promoter utilisation for EBNA transcription in EBV-positive gastric carcinomas Since the unequivocal detection of U/K-spliced EBNA1I mRNA with the concomitant absence of EBNA2 mRNA suggested Qp-driven EBNA transcription , we next investigated which of the three EBNA promoters actually mediated EBNA gene expression in EBV-positive gastric carcinomas .
As expected , EBNA mRNA with the Q/U/K-spliced structure was clearly detected in all cases tested , whereas mRNA with C1/W2 or WO/W2 exons , diagnostic of Cp and Wp usage , respectively , was not detected at all ( Figure 3 ) .
It is unlikely that the Q/U/K exon-containing EBNA1 transcript detected here was initiated from the BamHI-F promoter ( Fp ) , which was initially reported to be a third EBNA promoter ( Schaefer et al. , 1991 ; Sample et al. , 1991 ) and redefined thereafter as an early lytic promoter ( Lear et al. , 1992 ; Schaefer et al. , LMP2B R 325 bp posed uP __ um < a transcript 1 < 5 6 I 232 bp » Isas “ * Inoue Figure 2 Detection of LMP2A , LMP2B and BamHI-A transcripts by RT-PCR in EBV-positive gastric carcinomas .

1995b ) , because the vast majority of Fp-initiated lytic transcripts appeared not to contain the K exon ( Schaefer et al. , 1995 @ and b ) and , in addition , all tumour tissues examined showed no evidence of lytic infection ( see below ) .
Thus , the results indicated that Qp , not Cp or Wp , mediated EBNA transcription in gastric carcinoma .
Analyses of BZLFI gene expression in EBV-positive gastric carcinomas Figure 4 shows the results of RT-PCR analysis demonstrating that none of the tumours showed evidence for expression of BZLFl mRNA .
Similar negative results were also obtained by immunofluorescent staining with the BZ.1 monoclonal antibody in frozen tissue sections ( data not shown ) .
Since our RT-PCR system for detection of BZLFI mRNA was sensitive enough to detect ten or fewer Akata cells treated by surface IgG cross-linking ( data not shown ) , in which more than 80 % of cells were positive for the BZLFI antigen , EBV-positive gastric carcinoma was assumed to harbour EBV in a non-permissive form .

EBV gene expression in gastric carcinoma M Sugiura et al positive gastric carcinomas , thus resulting in the selective expression of EBNA1 mRNA , but not EBNA2Z mRNA , as is seen in BL and NPC ( Liebowitz and Kieff , 1993 ) .
In addition , neither LMPI nor LMP2B mRNA was detectable in any case examined .
These findings were consistent with our previous results showing by immunoblotting that EBV-positive gastric carcinoma cells lacked EBNA2 , -3A , -3B , 3C , -LP and LMP1 proteins ( Imai et al. , 1994 ) .
All seven EBV-positive tumours were also found to have BamHI-A transcripts together with the EBNA1l message , presumably corresponding to latency I of EBV infection typified by group I BL cells ( Kerr et al. , 1992 ) .
However , LMP2A mRNA was detected in three of seven cases tested , which may represent a novel latency of EBV-related tumours distinct from conventional latency I or II ( Kerr et a/. , 1992 ) .
Interest-ingly , this uniquely restricted pattern of latent gene expression in a subgroup of EBV-positive gastric carcinomas mostly resembled that observed in peripheral blood B lymphocytes of healthy EBV-seropositive individuals ( Qu and Rowe , 1992 ; Tierney et al. , 1994 ) , which would be advantageous for maintaining the life-long virus carrier state under effective immunity .
It was shown by using an isogenic system of group I BL cells that EBV indeed contributes to the malignant phenotypes ( Shimizu et al. , 1994 ) .
Accordingly , since EBNA1I , the putative BamHI-A product and EBERs are commonly expressed both in group I BL and in gastric carcinoma cells , they may also be responsible , to some extent , for the malignant features of gastric carcinoma .
Recently a possible role for in the EBV-induced oncogenic process has been proposed in that its Gly-Ala repetitive sequence inhibited the specific cytotoxic T-cell recognition of immunodominant EBNA3B through a cis-acting mode ( Levitskaya et al. , 1995 ) .
Several in vitro studies , however , demonstrated that LMP1 potentially confers tumorigenicity on non-lymphoid cells via transformation of established rodent fibroblasts ( Wang et al. , 1985 ) and human keratinocytes ( Fahraeus et al. , 1990 ) , inhibition of human epithelial cell differentiation ( Dawson et al. , 1990 ) , and induction of the functional epidermal growth factor receptor ( Miller et al. , 1995 ) .
Such important findings strongly support crucial roles for LMP1 in the development of undifferentiated NPC , where the LMP1I positivity exceeds 80 % of the cases at the trancriptional level ( Brooks et al. , 1992 ; Chen et al. , 1995 ) .
The exact lack of LMP1 expression in EBV-positive gastric carcinomas , irrespective of their histological phenotypes , implies that LMPI may not be necessary for the tumour , at least to sustain its already established malignant state .
Rather , LMPI1 might participate in an earlier stage of the tumour development and be down-regulated thereafter .
Alternatively , the lack of LMPI may reflect the result of BZLF1 3 Figure 4 RT-PCR analysis of immediate-early BZLF1 gene expression in EBV-positive gastric carcinomas .
Results are shown by Et-Br staining ( upper ) and Southern hybridisation with a *°P-labelled prope ( lower ) .

In fact , patients with EBV-positive gastric carcinoma have normally retained virus-specific immune T-cell responses ( Imai et al. , 1994 ) as is the case with BL ( Rooney et al. , 1985 ) , in contrast to NPC patients ( Moss et al. , 1983 ) .
The EBV replication can be switched on in malignant or non-malignant epithelial proliferative lesions in vivo ; the immediate-early BZLF1 , the early and/or late antigens were detected in NPC ( Cochet et al. , 1993 ) , thymic carcinoma ( Patton et al. , 1994 ) and AIDS-associated oral hairy leucoplakia ( OHL ) ( Greenspan et al. , 1985 ) .
Similar viral cycle events were also observed in vitro by experimental EBV infection of cells of epithelial origin ( Li et al. , 1992 ; Sixbey and Yao , 1992 ) .
There is a report of a patient with EBV-positive undifferentiated gastric carcinoma , in which a very small proportion of tumour cells expressed the BZLFI protein , indicating that rare gastric carcinoma cells can potentially enter the lytic cycle ( Niedobitek et al. , 1992 ) .
The present study in contrast , showed that neither the BZLFI mRNA nor protein was found in gastric carcinoma tissues , results compatible with the absence of the early and viral capsid antigens as previously reported ( Imai et a/. , 1994 ) .
In addition , although EBV latency can be disrupted as epithelial cells differentiate , as shown by observations in OHL ( Young et al. , 1991 ) , none of the gastric carcinomas with various differentiations showed any evidence of virus production .

It is unknown whether the finding can be extended to epithelial cells ; however , at least in certain EBV-positive gastric carcinomas , the absence of tumour cells entering the lytic cycle may be associated with LMP2A expression .
It was inferred from our series of data that , unlike in NPC or OHL cells , virus replication was uncommon or abortive in gastric carcinoma , and that the vast majority of tumour cells carried EBV in a tightly latent fashion .
The strict localisation of EBV genomes and viral gene expression only in tumour cells and their monoclonality ( Oda et al. , 1993 ; Imai et al. , 1994 ) strongly suggest that EBV may be indeed involved , not a passenger , in the development of virus-positive gastric carcinoma , although several questions remain to be resolved .
Further studies are necessary to understand more direct oncogenic activities of EBV on normal gastric mucosal epithelia and a factor ( s ) enhancing them .
