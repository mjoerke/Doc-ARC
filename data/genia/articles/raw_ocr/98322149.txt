Erythropoietin Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Jak2 , STATSA , and STAT5S5B in Primary Cultured Human Erythroid Precursors By Atsushi Oda , Kenichi Sawada , Brian J. Druker , Katsutoshi Ozaki , Hina Takano , Kazuki Koizumi , Yoshikazu Fukada , Makoto Handa , Takao Koike , and Yasuo Ikeda We examined signaling by erythropoietin in highly purified human colony forming unit-erythroid cells , generated in vitro from cells .
We found that erythropoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 , STATSA , and STATSB .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 reaches a peak around 10 minutes after stimulation and is maximum at 5 U/mL of erythropoietin .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS is accompanied by the translocation of activated STATS to the nucleus as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) using *°Pi-labeled STATS binding site in the B-casein pro-moter .
Tyrosine phosphorylation STAT1 or STAT3 was not detected in human erythroid precursors after stimulation RYTHROPOIETIN is a glycoprotein hormone that is essential for normal erythropoiesis . ''
In vitro , erythropoietin is absolutely required for the survival , proliferation , and differentiation of erythroid precursors , although a recent study showed that interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and its soluble form of the receptor may also have a similar effect on the erythroid precursors in the presence of stem cell factor ( SCF ) . ''
The effect of erythropoietin is exerted through binding to the specific receptors on the surface of responding cells , leading to dimerization of the receptors and activation of Jak2 tyrosine kinase . ''
Whether Jak2 is preassociated with the erythropoietin receptor before the ligand binding or not is a controversial issue . '' ''
A recent report suggests that the association is a multistep process , partially regulated through phosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine and serine residues . ''
It was reported by many that activation of Jak2 is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins including Jak2 itself , STAT proteins , Shc , Vav , and the erythropoietin receptor , although tyrosine kinases other than Jak2 may also phosphorylate these Colony-forming unit-erythroid ( CFU-E ) comprises only 0.5 % or less of all cells in normal bone marrow . ''
Accordingly , most of the studies cited above have used murine factor-dependent cell lines genetically engineered to express erythropoietin receptors or murine and human leukemic cell lines responding to erythropoietin .
Although such cells would undergo differentiation in response to erythropoietin , the signaling processes in them could be affected by cellular transformation .
A few studies have used primary erythroid cells from rodents or We show here that purified erythroid progenitors can be expanded from CD34* cells in human peripheral blood in sufficient numbers to allow the examination of early signaling by erythropoietin .

Thus , human erythroid precursors can be expanded in vitro in sufficient numbers and purity to allow its usage in signal transduction studies .
This report sets a basis for further studies on signaling in primary cultured human erythroid precursors , which in turn contribute to our better understanding in the differentiation processes of erythrocytes and their precursors .

SIGNALING IN HUMAN ERYTHROID CELLS with cell lysates for 3 hours on ice .
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes for immunoblot analysis .
RESULTS The purified fraction from mobilized PB contained 96.7 % * 1.6 % ( n = 3 , mean + SD ) CD34* cells .
Cultivation of PB CD34* cells for 8 days in serum-containing medium with erythropoietin , IL-3 , and SCF resulted in a 120 + 49-fold expansion of the total cell number ( day-8 cells , n = 8 ) with a viability of 96 % + 3 % .
A total of 71 % + 13 % cells expressed the specific erythroid marker Gly A , whereas CD34 and myelomonocytic marker CD13 were almost absent , as shown in Table 1 .
In morphologic analysis by May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining , day-8 cells predominantly consisted of immature erythroid cells with a purity of 92 % + 6 % , * '' whereas most of the remaining cells showed a basophilic/eosinophilic-like fea-ture .
The maturation level of erythroid progenitor cells closely associates with colony stimulating factor ( CSF ) requirements for erythroid development .
* When CSF requirements of day-8 cells were analyzed in serum-free medium , the ECFC required erythropoietin alone but not IL-3 and SCF for erythroid development , which indicates that ECFC in day-8 cells predominantly consists of mature erythroid progenitor cells .
The erythroid progenitor cells that gave rise to aggregates with 8 to 49 erythroblasts and that were equivalent to CFU-E , consisted 78.8 % + 2.5 % , whereas the rest of ECFC gave rise to aggregates with 2 to 7 erythroblasts .
We then set out to examine some early signaling events in these human erythroid precursor cells .
When Jak2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of erythroid cells before and after stimulation with erythropoietin ( 10 U/mL ) , we saw the induc-ible tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 ( Fig 1A , upper panel ) .
Jak2 was equally immunoprecipitated before and after stimulation ( Fig 1A , lower panel ) .
Time course experiments of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation showed tyrosine phosphorylation within 1 minute that reached a peak within approximately 10 minutes after addition of erythropoietin and then decreased ( 10 U/mL ; Fig 1B , upper panel ) .

445 manner ( 0.5 to 5 U/mL ; Fig 1C , upper panel ) .
Next , we examined whether STAT5A and B become tyrosine phosphorylated in erythroid cells stimulated with erythropoietin ( 10 U/mL , for 10 minutes ) .
A STATS monoclonal antibody recognizes both STAT 5A and STAT5B ( Fig 2 , lower panel ) .
The latter moved faster than STAT5A in the gel .
Both STATSA and STATS5B became tyrosine phosphorylated ( Fig 2 , upper panel ) .
The thin tyrosine phosphorylated band , which moved slower than STAT5B , may be STAT5A , because STATS5B antisera are weakly cross reactive with STAT5A according to the manufac-turers ' instructions .
After tyrosine phosphorylation , STATS dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it activates or represses transcription . ''
We next examined whether treatment of the erythroid cells with erythropoietin ( 10 U/mL , for 20 minutes ) resulted in the binding of STATS to a phosphorylated probe from the B-casein promoter by EMSA ( Fig 3 ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from the erythroid cells before and after stimulation with erythropoietin ( 10 U/mL , for 20 minutes ) .
Erythropoietin induced the electrophoretic shift of the end-labeled probe in the erythroid cells ( Fig 3 , shift ) .
STATS antisera supershifted the DNA-protein complex and bound to the labeled probe ( Fig 3 , super shift ) , indicating that STATS is activated by erythropoietin .
In contrast , neither STAT3 nor STAT1 was tyrosine phosphorylated in the erythroid cells stimulated by erythropoietin ( Fig 4 , upper panels ; 10 U/mL , for 10 minutes ) , whereas IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in TE-1 was readily detected under the same experimental conditions .
' > > Needless to say , we can not rule out slight erythropoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 under the threshold of our detection system .
We have recently observed that Crk ] , a 39-kD SH2/SH3 adapter protein , becomes associated with STATS in human platelets after stimulation by thrombopoietin ( submitted ) .
Given the similarity between thrombopoietin and erythropoietin signal transductions , we examined phosphotyrosine immunoblots of the Crk ] immunoprecipitates from erythropoietin-treated ery-throids , which show the presence of a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 95 to 100 kD ( Fig 5A ) .
This protein was reactive with an anti-STAT5 monoclonal antibody ( Fig 5B , upper panel ) .
Before and after stimulation the same amount of Crkl was immunoprecipitated from erythroid cells ( Fig 5B , lower panel ) .
To further confirm the specificity of Crkl-STATS5 interaction , the effects of phenylphosphate and Crk ] immunizing peptide were examined .
More STAT 5 was coimmunoprecipitated from erythropoietin-stimulated cells than starved ( rest-ing ) cells ( Fig 5C , upper panel ) .
Phenylphosphate ( 20 mmol/L ) , which is known to disrupt phosphotyrosine-dependent protein interactions and was added after the lysis of erythropoietin-stimulated cells , inhibited the coimmunoprecipitation of STATS5 with Crk ] ( Fig 5C , upper panel ) but not immunoprecipitation of Crk ] ( lower panel ) .
Crk ] immunizing peptide inhibited immunoprecipitation of Crk ] and STAT5 , suggesting that the Crk ] antisera is specific .
Because phenyl phosphate inhibited the coimmunoprecipitation of STATS with Crk ] and we only see tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS in erythroid cells , we suspected that the SH2 domain of Crk ] may be responsible for the binding of Crk ] to the phosphorylated STAT5 .
Accordingly , we examined the binding of STATS to bacterially expressed GST-Crkl-SH2 protein ( Fig From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

cell lines genetically engineered to express erythropoietin receptors or murine and human leukemic cell lines , regularly undergo full terminal differentiation and become reticulocytes , we believe that these studies are more likely to be reflective of in vivo situations , although the presence of the artifacts arising from in vitro culture still can not be ruled out .
When Drachman et al examined murine mature megakaryocytes and established cell lines for proximate signal transduction triggered by throm-bopoietin , they found that there were significant differences in these cells , suggesting that the results of the studies using the established cell lines may not readily be extended to primary cells . ''
These considerations led us to examine primary cultured human erythroid precursor cells for early signaling induced by erythropoietin .
We found that Jak2 became tyrosine phosphorylated in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in human erythroid cells , which was consistent with previous reports . '' '' ''
Erythropoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT5A and STAT5B in human erythroid cells is interesting , because only STAT5B became tyrosine phosphorylated in chicken erythroid cells . ''
We did not detect any increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in erythropoietin-stimulated human erythroid cells .
On the other hand , Penta and Sawyer ! ''
found that 447 erythropoietin-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its activation in murine erythroid cells .
Further , in rat erythroid cells from fetal liver , STAT3 was tyrosine phosphorylated on stimulation with erythropoietin .
'© Thus , these and our current data suggest the presence of species-specific differences in signaling by erythropoietin , although it is formally possible that different sensitivities used in detection of STATS activation may have contributed to the differences .
Further , our data suggest that erythropoietin and thrombopoietin may induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of different sets of STATs in human primary cells in spite of their similarity in amino acid sequence , ' > > 5 > '' although such differences may be obscured in the studies that used established cell lines .
* '' '' '' 8 We have previously reported that thrombopoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STATS5 in thrombopoietin-stimulated human platelets . ''
Drachman et al reported that the same set of STATs was tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in thrombopoietin-stimulated murine mega-karyocytes . '' ''
Thus , it is possible that the differences in activated STAT 's by erythropoietin and thrombopoietin may be important in the lineage-specific developments of both erythrocytic and megakaryocytic precursors .
The differences between the studies that used primary erythroids and those that used cell lines are not limited to STAT proteins .
Barber et al have shown that Crk ] becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with c-Cbl on stimulation by erythropoietin . '' ''
However , we found that in primary erythroids Crk ] becomes associated with a 95-kD tyrosine phosphorylated protein , which has been identified as STAT 5 .
This coimmunoprecipitation of Crk ] and STATS is not likely caused by the cross reactivity of Crk ] antisera with STATS because of the following three reasons ( Fig 5 ) : ( 1 ) Crk ] antisera coimmunoprecipitated STAT5 mostly after stimulation of cells with erythropoietin , suggesting that , if this is a cross reactivity , the Crk ] antisera + +\ | EPO - + eSTAT5S _ - - & Super Shift # -- - Shift Fig 3 .

( A , upper panel ) Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was not tyrosine phosphorylated in the erythroid cells stimulated with erythropoietin for 10 minutes .
The erythroid cells were lysed by the addition of an equal amount of a buffer containing 2 % Triton X-100 before and after exposure to erythropoietin ( 10 U/mL ) .
STAT3 was immunoprecipitated with specific anti-STAT3 antisera .
As a positive control , TF-1 cells were stimulated with IL-6 ( 100 ng/mL ) for 10 minutes .
Immune complexes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was detected by 4G10 as described in Fig 1A .

must recognize only the activated form of STATS .
( 2 ) Crkl immunoprecipitation and STATS5 coimunoprecipitation were inhibited by Crkl immunizing peptides whose amino acid sequence is not found in STATS .
( 3 ) Phenylphosphate inhibited coimmunoprecipitation of STATS without impairing the immunoprecipitation of Crk1 , suggesting that Crkl-STAT5 interaction may be dependent on phosphotyrosine on STAT5 , because we did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Crkl .
The last supposition was supported by the results of in vitro binding of GST-Crkl-SH2 to STATS from stimulated erythroid cells ( Fig 5D ) , suggesting that STATS could be binding to Crk ] through its phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction with the SH2 domain of Crkl .
However , STATS is thought to dimerize when tyrosine phosphorylated through its SH2 domain binding to the tyrosine phosphate of another STAT protein .
`` ® '' Possible explanations for this finding include the fact that dimerization of STATS is required for binding to Crk ] or that erythropoietin treatment results in an altered subcellular localization of Crk ] or STAT5 that allows these proteins to interact .
Alternatively , another protein could be involved in mediating the complex formation .
Although more studies are necessary , our study indicates that activated STATS5 complex is not simply made of dimerized STATS5 in human erythroid cells and that the complex may include Crk ] and possible other proteins as well .
Taken together , our data suggest that the results of the studies that used the primary erythroids may be quite different from those obtained from the experiments that were solely dependent on cell lines , giving a rationale for further examinations of the signal transduction of primary human erythroid precursors ( Fig 5 ) .
Further , the importance of examinations of proximal signal transduction was supported by the recent reports , suggesting that abrogation of tyrosine phosphorylation may be related to the increased erythropoiesis in polycythemic pa-tients.334° From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .
