1826 BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL - VOLUME 282 6 junE 1981 Glucocorticoid receptor concentrations and terminal transferase activity as indicators of prognosis in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia LAMBERT SKOOG , BO NORDENSKJOLD , AKE OST , BORJE ANDERSSON , ROBERT HAST , NICOLOUS GIANNOULIS , SOLVEIG HUMLA , TORSTEN HAGERSTROM , PETER REIZENSTEIN Abstract Activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT ) , adenosine deaminase , and 5'nucleotidase and the cellular concentration of glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone ) receptor were determined in 25 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
All patients were treated according to a common protocol .
Increased activity of TdT ( > 0-1 unit/ug DNA ) was found in 11 patients .
This group of patients was shown to have higher remission and survival rates ( p=0-06 ) compared with patients with low activity of TdT .
The glucocorticoid receptor concentration of the leukaemic blast cells ranged from 0 to 0-94 fmol/ug DNA .
Thirteen patients had blast cells with a glucocorticoid receptor concentration over 022 fmol/ug DNA .
These patients had significantly increased remission and survival rates ( p=0-006 ) compared with those with a low receptor concentration .
This finding can not be explained by a difference in sensitivity to glucocorticoids since these were not used as therapeutic agents .
Adenosine deaminase and 5'nucleotidase activities both varied within two orders of magnitude .
No correlation could be found between activities of these enzymes and remission or survival rate .
These results show that measurements of TdT activity and the glucocorticoid receptor concentration yield valuable prognostic information in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
Introduction Immunological and cytochemical classification of subgroups in acute leukaemia has in the past few years raised the hope of more accurate diagnosis and differentiated treatment .
Moreover , biochemical studies have identified marker enzymes that will aid in the subclassification of acute leukaemia .
At present two such enzyme markers , terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TIT ) and hexosaminidase , appear to be of definite value .
In children the activity of TdT is high in the T and common type of acute lymphocytic leukaemia ( non-T-non-B ) , while patients with B-cell-derived leukaemias have low activity of the enzyme . '
Isoenzyme analysis of hexosaminidase has shown that `` common acute lymphocytic leukaemia '' in children has a distinct and Department of Pathology , Karolinska Hospital , Stockholm , Sweden LAMBERT SKOOG , mp , rHp AKE OST , mp SOLVEIG HUMLA , ta TORSTEN HAGERSTROM , ta Department of Radiumhemmet , Karolinska Hospital BO NORDENSKJOLD , mp , pup Department of Medicine , Division of Haematology , Karolinska Hospital BORJE ANDERSSON , mp , rup ROBERT HAST , mp , rup NICOLOUS GIANNOULIS , mp PETER REIZENSTEIN , MD , PHD easily identifiable pattern . ''
Accordingly , measurements of the cellular TdT activity and hexosaminidase isoenzyme pattern will subclassify acute lymphocytic leukaemia as being of the T , B , or common type .
Since common acute lymphocytic leukaemia in children has a much better prognosis than acute lymphocytic leukaemia of T- or B-cell origin analysis of hexosaminidase and TdT activity obviously has great practical implications .
Activity of TdT is generally low in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia , although occasional cases of acute myeloblastic leukaemia with raised TdT activity have been reported .
It has also been reported that the presence of detectable TdT activity in blast cells from patients with chronic myelocytic leukaemia in blastic crisis predicts a high response rate to chemotherapy .
The state of two other enzymes , 5'nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase , is less certain .
Activity of 5'nucleotidase appears to be lower in mature than immature lymphocytes ; and it is considerably decreased in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia , suggesting its usefulness as a marker for cellular differentiation .
So far little is known about the activity of 5'nucleotidase in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia . ''
Adenosine deaminase was initially suggested as a marker for blast cells in acute lymphocytic leukaemia , but some patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia also show high activity of the enzyme . ''
We do not know whether measurements of adenosine deaminase activity might be useful in defining new subgroups in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
Determinations of glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in lymphoblasts from children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia have shown a correlation between high receptor concentrations and response to cytostatic drug combinations containing glucocorticoids . ''
Little is known about glucocorticoid receptors in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
We undertook the present study to evaluate TdT , adenosine deaminase , and 5'nucleotidase activities and the glucocorticoid receptor concentration as indicators of prognosis in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
Patients We studied 25 adults with untreated acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia included in the protocol of the Swedish Leukaemia Study Group .
The age range was 19-86 years ( median age 57 years ) .
There were 13 women and 12 men .
Fifteen patients were aged under 60 years and were treated with daunorubicin plus cytarabine initially and after remission with either daunorubicin plus cytarabine or cytarabine plus thioguanine .
The 10 patients aged 60 years and over received a milder initial treatment : thioguanine plus cytarabine in eight and prednimustine ( Leo , Sweden ) in two .
The overall remission rate was 40 % .
Acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia was diagnosed primarily on the basis of routinely stained slides ( May-Griinwald-Giemsa ) and on standard morphological criteria .
In some cases cytochemical stainings were made primarily .
All slides were reviewed by one of us ( A0 ) , and cytochemical characterisation was performed on thawed specimens according to the technique of Ogier et al ( paper in preparation ) .
The staining methods used were peroxidase , ° naphthol AS-D acetate esterase with and without sodium fluoride , ° '' '' and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase . ''
The classification was made according to the FAB classification . ' ''
Sixteen patients were classified as having myeloblastic leukaemias ( MI-M2 ) and eight as having acute myelo- BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL - VOLUME 282 6 junE 1981 Clinical and haematological data on patients studied 1827 Peripheral blood Bone marrow Diagnosis Duration of Case Age - Sex White Enzyme activities ( units/ug DNA ) FAB Remission remission No ( years ) cell Blast Dexamethasone Blast Auer classification ) ( days ) count cells Adenosine receptor cells rods ( x 10/1 ) ( `` w ) TIT deaminase 5'Nucleotidase ( fmol/ug DNA ) % o 1 42 F 7 62 3-10 128 0-03 0-43 79 - M1 Yes 2880* 2 36 M 41 88 0-58 20-0 0-68 0-29 82 + M2 Yes 384* 3 45 F 38 74 0-01 712 0-47 0-52 67 + M2 Yes 146* 4 19 M 19 52 1-24 444 0-32 0-22 56 + M2 No 60+ 5 33 F 33 93 0-01 29-4 0-27 0-38 82 + M2 Yes 188* 6 27 M 21 90 0-42 39-1 0-32 0-68 85 + M2 Yes 236* 7 54 F 30 68 0-01 14-0 0-16 0-14 89 - M2 No 36 8 67 F 273 96 0-01 ND 0-75 0-12 91 - M1 No 14 9 57 M 42 92 0-01 188 0-68 0-18 ND + M1 No 29 10 43 M 17 30 0-90 0-4 0-24 0-18 56 + MSb Yes 543* 11 86 F 164 95 0-01 155 ND 0-16 94 + M1 No 12 61 F 204 97 19-20 15-5 4:31 0-94 97 - AUL ?

*Alive on 1 October 1979. monocytic or acute monocytic type ( M4-M5 ) .
Only one patient ( case 12 ) had a negative cytochemical profile and no detectable Auer rods , suggesting an acute undifferentiated or an acute lymphocytic leukaemia .
This patient was primarily diagnosed as having acute myeloblastic leukaemia and was therefore treated according to the common protocol for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
The table gives clinical and haematological data on each patient .
Material and methods Isolation of blast cells-Peripheral blood from patients with untreated leukaemia was collected into heparinised tubes ; the buffy coat was isolated after spontaneous sedimentation and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen .
Blast cells were isolated from the thawed buffy coat by Ficoll-Isopaque density-gradient centrifugation .
They were washed with phosphate-buffered saline , after which their viability was tested by the trypan blue dye exlusion test .
In no case was the viability less than 95 % .
The cells were sedimented and either used immediately for biochemical analysis or frozen as a pellet and stored in liquid nitrogen until used .
Glucocorticoid receptor concentrations-Cells were thawed on ice , and 0-5 ml of TE buffer ( TRIS hydrochloric acid 10 mmol/l ( pH 7-2 ) , EDTA 1-5 mmol/l ) containing dithiotreitol 1 mmol/l and *H-dexa-methasone ( 25 Ci/mmol , Radiochemical Centre , Amersham ) 500 nmol/l was added .
The tissue was homogenised with a Polytrone ( 2 x 15 s , setting 3 ) and incubated on ice for 60 minutes .
The homogenate was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 minutes and an aliquot of the supernatant solution removed for determination of protein content by measuring the difference in absorbance at 280 and 310 nm .
The pellet was analysed for DNA content according to the method of Burton , ! ''
which was used as the reference measurement of specific binding .
Crystallised trypsin ( Worthington ) was added ( 5 ug/optical density unit of cytosol ) , and after incubation for 30 minutes at 10°C the cytosol was shaken with one-fifth volume of dextran-coated charcoal ( dextran : charcoal=1:10 w/w ) .
The suspension was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 minutes and the resulting supernatant placed in 300 ul sample frames on polyacrylamide gels ( LKB , pH range 3-5-10-0 ) near the cathode at approximately pH 8 and subjected to isoelectric focusing for two hours ( Ogier et al , paper in preparation ) .
After pH measurement the gel was cut into 5 mm slices and placed in 5 ml Instagel ( Packard ) .
After incubation overnight at 20°C the radioactivity was measured in a Packard liquid scintillation counter .
The radioactivity moving as a single peak in the pH 6 region was taken as a measure of the glucocorticoid receptor .
Excess of unlabelled dexamethasone in the incubation mixture resulted in elimination of 90-100 % of this peak .
Enzyme analysis-TdT ( Enzyme Commission 2 7 7 31 ) was assayed by the following method .
Pellets of leukaemic cells were thawed in ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer ( 0-25 mol/l ; pH 7-5 ) and homogenised in a Polytron homogeniser ( 2 x 15 s , setting 3 ) .
The homogenate was stirred for one hour at 4°C .
A fraction of this solution was precipitated with perchloric acid 0-5 mol/l and the resulting pellet used for DNA determination according to the method of Burton . ''
The remaining homogenate was centrifuged at 100 000 g for one hour at 4°C .
The supernatant was used for determination of TdT activity .
The assay mixture contained in a volume of 0-1 ml : 0-025 optical density units of poly p-adenosine ; ; -i & , ( P L Bioch Co , Milwaukee , USA ) ; 0-1 umol *H-D-guanosine triphosphate ( specific activity 3000 cpm/pmol ; Radiochemical Centre , Amersham ) ; TRIS hydrochloric acid 42 mmol/l ( pH 7-5 ) ; potassium chloride 42 mmol/l ; dithiothreitol 42 mmol/l ; manganese chloride 80 umol/l ; and 5-25 pl of the supernatant as the enzyme source .
After 30 minutes at 37°C the tubes were transferred into ice , and 0-2 ml of 10 % trichloroacetic acid containing sodium pyrophosphate 0-02 mol/l was added .
The mixture was left on ice for 30 minutes .
The acid-insoluble fraction was collected on a glass-fibre filter ( Whatman GF-C ) , which was washed with 10 ml of ice-cold 10 % trichloroacetic acid containing sodium pyrophosphate 0-02 mol/l .
After drying , the radioactivity of the filters was measured in a liquid scintillation counter .
Activity of 5'nucleotidase ( Enzyme Commission 3 1 3 5 ) was measured by the method of Quagilata et al.s Adenosine deaminase ( Enzyme Commission 3 5 4 4 ) activities were measured® in extracts used also for TdT determinations .
Results Glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in blasts-Twenty-four patients had dexamethasone values of between 0-12 and 0-94 fmol/ug DNA .
In one patient we were unable to detect receptor ( table ) .
The median value was 0-22 fmol/ug DNA , corresponding to approximately 1300 receptor mol/cell .
Figure 1 compares the survival of the 12 patients with receptor concentrations below 0-22 fmol/ug DNA with that of the 13 patients with a cellular receptor concentration of 022-094 fmol/ug DNA .
Clearly , increased receptor concentrations were correlated with increased survival ( p=0-006 , log-rank test ) .
We also analysed separately the 14 patients aged under 60 .
The decreased survival among those with less than the median amount of receptor was also evident in this group and was significant ( p=0-011 , log-rank test ) .
TdT activity-The table shows that 11 of the patients had TIT activities of 0-4-19-2 units/ug DNA while 14 patients had low activities ( undetectable to 0-09 units/ug DNA ) .
Figure 2 compares the survival of the 11 patients with high ( > 0-1 units/ug DNA ) TdT activity with the survival of the 14 patients with low ( < 0-1 units/ug DNA ) TdT activity .
Survival appeared to be increased in the 11 patients with increased activity ( p=0-06 , log-rank test ) .
The survival of the six young patients with TdT activity over 0-1 units/ug DNA was com 1828 pared separately with that of the nine young patients with low TdT activity .
Figure 3 shows a significantly increased survival ( p=0-035 , log-rank test ) in the young patients with high TdT activity .

Combination of receptor concentration and TdT activity as predictors of survival-We further analysed the survival of the 14 patients with low TdT activity in their blast cells .

Discussion Lippman et al'* showed that children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia have a more favourable prognosis if their leukaemic cells contain more than about 6000 glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell .
The interpretation of this finding is complicated by the fact that treatment programmes for acute lymphocytic leukaemia contain glucocorticoids .
Therefore , the effect might be due to either a more favourable response to glucocorticoids or a more benign biology of leukaemias with increased receptor content or to a combination of these factors .
So far little is known about the state of the glucocorticoid receptor in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
We found a median value of 0-22 fmol glucocorticoid receptor per ug DNA in this disease .
Assuming an average value of 10 pg DNA per cell this corresponds to about 1300 sites per cell .
It is tempting to speculate that the low receptor concentration correlates with the limited effect of glucocorticoids in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
We found a decreased survival in patients with less than 0-22 fmol glucocorticoid binding per ug DNA .
In contrast to the corresponding finding in acute lymphocytic leukaemia this difference can not be explained by differences in response to glucocorticoid treatment since steroids were not included in the treatment of our patients .
It rather must reflect a more aggressive biology of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia with decreased receptor concentration .
We treat patients over 60 years of age with a milder form of chemotherapy .
Ten such patients participated in the study , and when they were excluded from the analysis the difference between patients with high and low receptor concentrations was still evident .
Therefore , selection of elderly patients or patients treated with less intensive chemotherapy does not explain the decreased survival of patients with low receptor concentrations .
TdT was identified as a characteristic of immature lympho-cytes and considerable TdT activity was found in blast cells from patients with lymphocytic leukaemia Acute lymphocytic leukaemia with high activity of TdT ( T-cell leukaemia ) has a decreased remission rate and decreased survival as compared with lymphocytic leukaemias with low TdT activity .
In non-lymphocytic leukaemia , however , TdT activity is generally low , although some rare cases with high activity have been reported .
Thus the value of routine measurements of TdT activity in non-lymphocytic leukaemia may be questioned .
There is evidence , however , that the presence of TdT activity in chronic myelogenous leukaemia in blast crises confers a favourable prognosis of response to chemotherapy .
* This observation BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL - VOLUME 282 6 jung 1981 should be correlated with our finding that TdT activity is also associated with increased survival and remission rates in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
We should emphasise that the TdT activity in our patients was low , which indirectly rules out that some with acute lymphocytic leukaemia had been misdiagnosed as having acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
This is also supported by cytochemical and morphological analysis .
The possibility still exists , however , that increased TdT activity indicates the presence of two blast populations , one lymphoid TdT -positive and a second myeloid or monocytic TdT -negative , as has been described by Mertelsmann et al . '' ''
We thus conclude that measurements of glucocorticoid receptor concentrations and TdT activity contribute partially independent prognostic information .
When both are decreased a group of patients with a much decreased survival is identified .
In view of our findings we think that measurement of glucocorticoid receptor concentration and TdT activity should be considered in the design of future prospective studies of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .

( Accepted 10 April 1981 ) Oral contraceptive steroid plasma concentrations in smokers and non-smokers F E CRAWFORD , DJ BACK , MLE ORME , A M BRECKENRIDGE Abstract A study was performed to find out whether the overall rate of metabolism of oral contraceptives is affected by smoking and whether this explains the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in users of oral contraceptives who smoke .
Plasma ethinyloestradiol and norgestrel concentrations in 311 women using oral contraceptives were similar in smokers and non-smokers .
The overall rate of metabolism of contraceptive steroids does not therefore seem to be affected by cigarette smoking .

''
Tobacco smoke contains over 3000 chemicals and some of the constituents ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) are enzyme-inducers .
In pharmacokinetic studies the rate of metabolism of some drugs-for example , phenacetin and antipyrine-is increased in cigarette smokers .
In contrast , no effect of smoking has been observed on the disposition of other drugs-for example , diazepam and phenytoin . ''
The metabolism of ethinyloestradiol may be important in relation to toxicity : a metabolite of ethinyloestradiol becomes irreversibly bound to protein of human hepatic microsomes , '' and this could be the starting point of an immunological mechanism leading to an adverse reaction .
Consistent with this , anti-ethinyloestradiol antibodies have been detected in oral contraceptive users .
The aim of our study was twofold : to find out whether oral contraceptives fall into the group of drugs whose overall rate of metabolism is affected by smoking , and to see whether this might account for the increased toxicity .
Subjects , methods , and results We studied 311 women taking oral contraceptives containing 30 ug ethinyloestradiol ( Eugynon 30 , Microgynon , and Ovranette ) .
A blood sample was obtained from each woman , and we recorded the time of the last pill , her weight , age , whether she smoked ( and the number of cigarettes per day ) , and any other medication .
