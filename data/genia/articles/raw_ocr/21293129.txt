Interferon-y ( IFN-y ) , a cyto-kine that exerts many pro-atherosclerotic effects in vivo , causes up-regulation of ACAT-1 mRNA in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and macrophage-like cells but not in other cell types .
To examine the molecular nature of this observation , we identified within the ACAT-1 P1 promoter a 159-base pair core region .
This region contains 4 Spl elements and an IFN-y activated sequence ( GAS ) that overlaps with the second Spl element .
In the monocytic cell line THP cell , the combination of IFN-y and all-trans-retinoic acid ( a known differentiation agent ) enhances the ACAT-1 P1 promoter but not the P7 promoter .
Additional experiments showed that all-trans-retinoic acid causes large induction of the transcription factor STAT1 , while IFN-y causes activation of STAT1l such that it binds to the GAS/Spl site in the ACAT-1 P1 promoter .
Our work provides a molecular mechanism to account for the effect of IFN-y in causing transcriptional activation of ACAT-1 in macrophage-like cells .
ACAT is an intracellular enzyme responsible for catalyzing the intracellular formation of cholesteryl esters from choles- * This work was supported by National Natural Scientific Foundation of China Grant 89425005 ( to B.

In mammals , two ACAT genes have been identified ( 2-5 ) .
In adult human tissues , ACAT-1 is the major enzyme present in various tissues , including macrophages , liver ( hepatocytes and Kupffer cells ) , and adrenal gland ( 6 , 7 ) .
ACAT-1 is also present in the intestine ; however , the major enzyme involved in the intestinal cholesterol absorption may be ACAT-2 , which is mainly located in the apical region of the intestinal villi ( 7 ) .
The relative tissue distributions of ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 in mice and monkeys are not entirely consistent with those found in humans ( 8 , 9 ) raising the possibility that the distribution of the two ACAT 's in various tissues may be species dependent .
In macrophages and other cell types , a dynamic cholesterol-cholesteryl ester cycle exist ; the formation of intracellular cholesteryl esters is catalyzed by ACAT-1 , while the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters is catalyzed by the enzyme neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase ( 10 , 11 ) .
The net accumulation of intracellular cholesteryl esters is affected at the substrate level , as well as at the levels of the enzymes ACAT and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase ( 12-14 ) .
The main mode of sterol-specific regulation of ACAT-1 has been identified at the post-translational level , involving allosteric regulation by its substrate cholesterol ( 1 , 15 ) .
On the other hand , the cellular and molecular nature of non-sterol-mediated ACAT-1 regulation remains largely unknown .
Recently , using mouse macrophage-derived foam cells , Panousis and Zuckerman ( 12 ) reported that IFN-y increased the cellular cholesteryl ester content and reduced high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux ; its cellular effects were attributed to its ability to increase ACAT message ( 12 ) and to induce down-regulation of the Tangier Disease gene ( the ABC1 trans-porter ) ( 16 ) .
In the current work , we showed that IFN-y increased ACAT-1 message and protein content in human monocyte-derived macrophages .
To examine the molecular mechanism of IFN-y action on ACAT-1 gene regulation in macrophages , we identified the important cis-acting elements in the human ACAT-1 P1 promoter .
In order to perform transient transfection experiments , we used THP-1 cell , a monocytic human cell line as the cell model .
Upon treatment with retinoids , including all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , THP-1 cells differentiate into macrophage-like cells ( 17-20 ) .
Our results show that ATRA and IFN-y synergistically caused up-regulation of ACAT-1 gene expression .
Additional experiments revealed that ATRA causes increased gene expression of the transcription factor STAT1 , while IFN-y is essential to cause reaction ; GAPDH , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ; knt , kelonucleotides .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Treatments-Human monocytes were isolated according to a published procedure ( 21 ) with slight modification : human leukocyte packs were obtained from Shanghai Blood Service Center and used within 1 day .
The cells were diluted ( 2:1 , v/v ) with cold phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , layered on an equal volume of Ficoll-Paque ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , and centrifuged for 20 min at 2,500 rpm at room temperature .
Mononuclear cells were collected and washed three times at 4°C ( to remove platelets ) by adding 100 ml of PBS followed by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min .
The remaining red blood cells in the pellet were lysed by treatment with 10 ml of 0.2 % NaCl for 45 s , followed by sequential additions of 10 ml of 1.6 % NaCl and 30 ml of cold PBS .
The pelleted cells were suspended in cold RPMI 1640 with 7 % human type AB serum to a density of 5 X 10°/ml , plated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes that were precoated with 2 ml/dish of FBS , and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C .
Next , the dishes were washed three times with warm RPMI 1640 ( 37 °C ) to remove unadhered cells .
The adhered cells were judged to be more than 95 % monocytes by @ -naphthylacetate esterase staining .
The cells were cultured for up to 16 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 7 % human type AB serum , with a medium change every other day .
Other cell lines were from ATCC .
Cells were incubated 60-mm dishes in a 37 °C incubator with 5 % atmospheric CO , .
All media were supplemented with 100 ug/ml kanamycin , 50 units/ml streptomycin , 2 g/liters sodium bicarbon-ate , plus 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) .

Chimeric Plasmid Construction-The 682-bp DNA fragment containing the human ACAT-1 P1 promoter ( -598/+84 ) ( 26 ) was inserted into the multiple cloning sites of the luciferase reporter gene vector pGL2-E ( Promega ) .
This fragment was stepwise deleted from both ends by various suitable restriction endonucleases to create plasmids that contained the 834 , -188/+84 , -125/+34 , -598/-126 , and the -598/ -189 fragments , respectively .
Deletion and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Sp1 and GAS Elements in ACAT-1 P1 Promoter in pGL2-E-Deletions were achieved by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the corresponding set of mutant primers that included a 6-bp KpnI or NhelI linker flanking the primer sequences on the vector .
The primer sequences on the vector are : GLP1 , 5'-TGT-ATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG-3 ' ; GLP2 , CTTCCA-3 ' .
The primers used to make 5'- and 3'-deletion mutations ( to generate the -110/+84 , -100/+84 , -100/-7 , -100/-17 , and the -100/-27 fragments ) were 5'-aaaggtaccGGTGGGCGGAAC-3 ' , 5-aaa-ggtaccACTGGCAACCTG-3 ' , 5'-aaagetagCcCGGCCCCTACGC-3 ' , 5-aa-agetagCcGCCCCCTGCCTC-3 ' , and 5'-aaagetagCTCCGAGCACCGC-3 ' , respectively .
The PCR products were then digested with KprI and Nhel and subcloned into an empty pGL2-E vector .
The fidelity of all these constructs was verified by sequencing .
Site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken using a modification of the procedure described by Ho et al .
( 27 ) .
Briefly , two overlapping fragments of the promoter subcloned into the pGL2-E vector were amplified separately .
The first reaction used a flanking primer that hybridized with the vector at the 5'-end of the inserted sequence , and an internal primer that hybridized at the site of the desired mutation and contained the mismatched base .
The second reaction included one flanking primer that hybridized with the vector at the 3'-end of the inserted sequence , and an internal primer that overlapped with the site of the desired mutation and also contained the mismatched base .
The two overlapping fragments generated by PCR Activation of ACAT-1 by IFN-y in Foam Cell Formation are `` fused '' by denaturing and annealing in a subsequent primer extension reaction .
Finally the `` fusion '' product was amplified by PCR using the primers GLP1 and GLP2 .
The product of the final PCR was digested with KpnI and NheI and subcloned into the pGL2-E vector .
To guard against PCR-associated nucleotide incorporation errors , the integrity of all the constructs generated was sequenced using an automated ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer ( Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems , Canada Inc. , Mississaug , ON ) .
To generate the fragments Spl-lm , Spl-2m , Sp1l-8m , Spl-4m , and GASm , respectively , the following sets of primer pairs were used : 5'-CCTCCCCGTTCCGGTACCTCCCC-8'/5'-GGGGAGGTACCGGAACGGGGAGG-3 ' , 5'-CAGTTCCGTTCACCTCC-CCGCC-3'/5-GGCGGGGAGGTGAACGGAACTG-3 ' , 5'-GAGGCAGG-5'- 5-GTTGCCAGCCCCGCCCACCTCC-3'/5-GGAGGTGGGC-GGGGCTGGCAAC-3 ' .
For additional mutagenesis work , we used Spl-lm as the template and 5-CAGTTCCGTTCACCTCCCCGTT-3/5 as the primer pair to generate Sp1l-12m , used Spl-12m as the template and 5'-GAGGCAG-GAAGCGTAGGGGCCG-3'/5-CGGCCCCTACGCTTCCTGCCTC-3 ' as the primer pair to generate Sp1l-123m , used Sp1l-123m as the template and 5'-AAGCGTAGAAGCCGGGCTGTCC-3'/5-GGACAGCCCGGCTT-CTACGCTT-3 ' as the primer pair to generate Sp1l-1234m .
STAT1 Mutant Expression Plasmid-The human STAT1 cDNA ( en-coding the 750 amino acids of STAT1 protein ) in pRC/CMV ( pRC/CMV-STAT1 ) was a gift from Dr. Darnell ( Rockefeller University ) .
The mutant STATI expression plasmid was created using the site-directed mutagenesis procedure of Ho ef al .
( 27 ) .
Two sets of primers 5'-GGAGAGAAGCTTCTTGGT-3'/5-CTGAAGTCTAGAAGGGTG-3 ' and 5'-AAGGAACTGGATTTATCAAGACTGA-3/5'-TCAGTCTTGATA-AATCCAGTTCCTT-3 ' were used to mutate STAT1 at amino acid 701 ( the Jak1/2 phosphorylation site ) from tyrosine to phenylalanine ( 28 ) .
The expression plasmid pRC/CMV-STAT1-Y701Fm was constructed by inserting the mutant PCR product digested with HindII/Xbal into the same sites of pRC/CMV .

Western Blot Analysis-Cells were harvested with 10 % SDS in 50 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA ( pH 7.5 ) with 25 mM dithiothreitol , and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min , then sheared with a syringe fitted with an 18-gauge needle .
Protein concentration of the cell extract was determined by a modified Lowry method ( 84 ) .
The affinity purified anti-ACAT-1 IgGs ( designated as DM10 ) was used as the primary antibodies against ACAT-1 ( 35 ) .
Western blots , using freshly prepared cell extracts in SDS , were conducted according to a previously described procedure ( 85 ) .
ACAT Activity Assay-The assay was performed essentially as described previously ( 15 , 35 ) .

The ACAT-l-deficient mutant cell line AC29 , and its parental cell 25RA derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells ( 2 , 15 , 35 ) were used to ensure that the ACAT activity assayed in vitro work properly .
For THP-1 cells , the suspended and adherent cells were collected by direct centrifugation and scrapping , respectively , at room temperature .
The two groups of cells collected from the same dish were pooled together , washed with PBS once , and centrifuged to collect the cell pellets .
Cold 1 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA ( pH 7.8 ) , at 100 ul/sample , was added to cell pellet chilled on ice .
The mixtures were left on ice for 5 min .
Brief but vigorous vortexing ( 30 s to 1 min ) was used to cause extensive cell lysis .
The protein concentration of the cell homogenates was kept at 2-4 mg/ml in buffer A ( 50 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.8 with protease inhibitors ) .
The enzyme was solubilized and assayed in mixed micelle condition as previously described ( 85 ) .
RESULTS A 159-bp Core Region with 4 Sp1 Elements Is Responsible for Human ACAT-1 P1 Promoter Activity-Human ACAT-1 gene is located in two different chromosomes ( 1 and 7 ) , each chromosome containing a separate ACAT-1 promoter ( Pl and P7 ) .
Northern analyses have revealed the presence of four ACAT-1 mRNAs ( 7.0 , 4.3 , 3.6 , and 2.8-knt ) in all the human tissues and cell lines examined ( 3 ) .
The 2.8 and 3.6-knt messages are produced from the P1 promoter , while the 4.3-knt mRNA is produced from two different chromosomes by a novel RNA recombination event that presumably involves trans-splicing ( 26 ) .
The P1 promoter is contiguous with the coding sequence and spans from -598 to +65 of the ACAT-1 genomic DNA ( 26 ) .
To determine the minimal region of the P1 promoter , we trans- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Activation of ACAT-1 by IFN-y in Foam Cell Formation A 4 5 2 3|-8 2 } 8 Eh _|—| “ I T 2 u 0 + -o & - + -o £0 IFN-y ai « 4 3 ATRA mos $ > % moe oz wo as up of P ] P ?

The synergistic effect of IFN-y and ATRA on ACAT P1 promoter is promoter specific and cell type specific .
A , the Lus constructs containing ACAT-1 P1 , or P7 , or the SV40 promoters ligated to the luciferase reporter vector ( pGL2-C ) were transfected into THP-1 cells .
7 h after transfection , cells were treated with or without IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) , or with ATRA ( 10~° M ) or IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) plus ATRA ( 10~° M ) , respectively .
The luciferase activity was determined in lysates of THP-1 cells 40 h later , and normalized by using values of -galactosidase .
The data were expressed as luciferase activities relative to the value from untreated cells as one .
Values represented the means from triplicate determinations .
Sizes of error bars represented 1 S.E .
B , the Luc construct containing ACAT-1 P1 promoter was transfected into THP-1 , U937 , HepG2 , Caco-2 , or HEK298 cells as indicated by methods described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
The cells were then treated and assayed as described in A. fected THP-1 cells with constructs containing various deleted fragments fused upstream to a luciferase reporter gene of the pGL2-enhancer vector ( pGL2-E ) , and measured luciferase activities .
As shown in the right panel !
of Fig .
1A , the results indicated that the maximal transcriptional activity is located within the 159-base pair from -125 to +34 ( Fig .
14 ) .
Sequence analysis by computer revealed 4 Spl elements are located in this core region ( Fig .
1B ) .
We next performed various specific deletion analyses to test the relative importance of these 4 Spl elements .
The results ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) showed that the most important basal transcription activity is present in the first two Spl elements from the 5'-end of the 159-bp core region .
To demonstrate the functional importance of the 4 Spl elements involved in basal transcription , we next performed EMSA .
We used nuclear extracts of THP-1 cells and the 159-bp DNA fragments containing mutations in each of all the 4 Spl elements as labeled probes .
The bindings of labeled probes were tested by competing with unlabeled wild-type or mutated probes in 100-fold molar excess .
The results ( Fig .
2C ) illustrated that the wild-type DNA fragment formed several DNA-protein complexes ( Zanes 2 , 4 , and 5 ) ; the bindings were eliminated upon incubation with excess unlabeled probe ( Zane 3 ) and 20993 J » Relative luciferase activity ( fold ) 0 : P R 500 1000 1500 2000 IFN-y ( U/m1 ) a 6C 3 2 $ s- > .Z § 4 } & © w § 3 2 ' 3 3 2 } 9 Mu s 1f 43 | [ « 4 n T i .

The dose and time dependence of the IFN-y and ATRA effects .

Afterward , the luciferase activity was determined as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''

IFN-y and ATRA symergisti- A cally increase ACAT-1 mRNA .
Total RNAs were prepared from THP-1 cells treated for 40 h with or without IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) , or with ATRA ( 10~° M ) or with IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) plus ATRA ( 10~ '' M ) , respectively .

Appro- 20 priate primers described under `` Experimental Procedures '' were used to obtain the ACAT-1 P1 promoter transcript ( designated as the P1 product ) , the ACAT-1 P7 promoter transcript ( designated as P7 product ) , and the transcript for the control gene ( indicated as GAPDH ) by RT-PCR .
Control experiments indicated that between cycles 25 and 35 , the ACAT-1 P1 0 transcript and the ACAT-1 P7 transcript IFN-y could be estimated semiquantitatively by ATRA RT-PCR ( data not shown ) .
The ratio of DNA contents ( shown at the bottom panels ) was determined using the UVP Lab- C work software ( UVP Inc. ) .

Interferon-y Causes up-regulation of Human ACAT Expression in Blood Monocyte-derived Macrophages-The human blood monocytes were incubated in culture for up to 16 days .
This procedure causes monocytic cells to differentiate into mature macrophages within several days .
Cells incubated for various time points were treated with or without IFN-y for 40 h. The total RNAs and proteins of treated and untreated cells were extracted for RT-PCR and Western blot .
The results show that both the ACAT-I P1 promoter transcript and the ACAT-1 protein level increased during the monocyte differentiation process ; and these increases were further augmented in cells treated with IFN-y ( Fig .
3 , A and C ) .
In contrast , the level of the human ACAT-1 P7 promoter transcript was not significantly altered throughout the time course of the experiment ( Fig .
3B ) .
The Combination of IFN-y and ATRA Is Needed to Enhance ACAT-1 P1 Promoter Activity in THP-1 Cell-Using THP-1 cell , we tested the functional responses of the ACAT-1 P1 promoter toward IFN-y , ATRA , or a combination of both .
As shown in Fig .
4A , treating cells with IFN-y and ATRA , but not with IFN-y or with ATRA alone , synergistically enhanced the luciferase expression driven by the ACAT-1 P1 promoter .
To investigate the cell type and promoter specificity of this effect , we tested the human ACAT-1 P1 , P7 , and SV40 promoters in THP-1 cells , using the luciferase reporter activity assays .
The results ( Fig .
4A ) showed that neither IFN-y , ATRA , nor their combination , had any detectable effect on the ACAT-1 P7 or the SV40 promoter .
We also tested the potential effect of ATRA and/or IFN-y on ACAT-1 P1 promoter in other human cell lines including HEK293 , HepG2 , CaCO-2 , and U937 .
The results ( Fig .
4B ) demonstrated that the synergistic effect of ATRA and IFN-y occurred only in the monocytic cell lines ( eg .
U937 , THP-1 ) , but not in other cell types ( eg .
HEK293 , HepG2 , or CACO-2 ) .
Using THP -1 cells , we next investigated the time and dose requirements .
For IFN-y , the results showed that the - 1.0 25 0.8 2.0 0.6 1.5 04 } n 02 0° 0 = + = + aoe es ATRA - ~10 % ( % n -l p % 2.8 knt 3.6 knt enhancement exhibited a saturable process , with maximal enhancement seen when IFN-y reached 500 units/ml ( Fig .
54 ) .
For ATRA , a non-saturable , linear relationship between concentration and effect was observed ( Fig .
5B ) .
The effect of IFN-y and ATRA continued to increase within the time frame examined ( 60 h , Fig .
5C ) .
To ascertain that the activating effect of ATRA/IFN-y on ACAT-1 promoter bears biological relevance , we treated THP-1 cells for 40 h with either IFN-y or ATRA , or a combination of both , then examined the ACAT-1 at the levels of mRNAs , protein , and enzyme activities .
Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the level of human ACAT-1 P1 promoter transcripts in treated cells increased by about 3-fold ( Fig .
6A ) , while the level of human ACAT-1 P7 promoter transcripts were not significantly altered ( Fig .
6B ) .
Consistent with these re-sults , Northern blotting ( Fig .
6C ) showed that the amounts of 3.6- and 2.8-knt mRNAs ( 26 ) were significantly enhanced by the combination treatment of IFN-y and ATRA .
In addition , the ACAT-1 protein as analyzed by Western blotting ( Fig .
7A ) , as well as by the ACAT enzyme activity , measured in cholesterol-independent manner , was all significantly and proportionally increased ( Fig .
7B ) .
IFN-y Activated Sequence ( GAS ) Is Required for the Synergistic Effect by IFN-y and ATRA-Sequence analysis by computer showed that the core region of human ACAT-1 P1 promoter contained an GAS that overlaps exactly with the second Spl element from 5'-end ( Fig .
8A ) .
To test its functional signif-icance , a series of P1 promoter deletion and point mutation constructs were made , linked to a luciferase reporter gene , and used in transient transfection studies in THP-1 cells .
The results indicated that the two constructs containing the GAS element ( at the top of Fig .
84 ) responded to IFN-y and ATRA , while the shorter promoter lacking the GAS element and first two Spl elements ( at the bottom of Fig .
8A ) did not .
Specific 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Activation of ACAT-1 by IFN-y in Foam Cell Formation mutations in the GAS element , but not mutations in the Spl elements , abrogated the synergistic effect by IFN-y and ATRA ( Fig .
8B ) .
Therefore , the GAS element , rather than the 4 Spl sites plays an important role in mediating the regulatory response to IFN-y and ATRA .
To further examine the functional significance of the GAS element , we isolated nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells co-treated with IFN-y and ATRA , and performed EMSA using the wild-type Pl promoter ( the 159-bp DNA ) as the labeled probe .
As shown in Fig .
8 , C and D , two specific bands , one migrating slower than the other , were detectable ( lane 2 ) .
These two bands were abolished by preincubation with unlabeled competitors containing all the Spl and GAS elements ( lane 3 ) .
As shown in Fig .
8C , gel supershift assays using either anti-Spl antibodies ( Zane 4 ) or anti-STAT1 antibodies ( lane 5 ) , or both antibodies ( Zane 6 ) , indicated that these two bands were specific complexes formed between STAT1 and Spl .
When excess unlabeled probes containing either the first or the second Spl element were used as competitors , the two bands were also competed out ( Zanes 7 and 8 ) .
When unlabeled probe containing only the first two mutant or all four mutant Spl elements were used as competitors , both bands moved faster ( Zanes 9 and 10 ) than those in the control lane ( Zane 2 ) .
These two bands were supershifted by using the anti-Spl antibody ( Zane 11 ) but not by using the anti-STAT1 antibody ( Zane 12 ) .
Additional experiments ( Fig .
8D ) showed that when labeled wild-type DNA fragments were used as probe and unlabeled DNA fragment containing all four wild-type Spl elements and the mutant GAS ( GASm ) as competitors , one band was found to move faster than the control lane ( comparing lanes 4-6 with lane 2 ) .
This band was supershifted by adding anti-STAT1 antibody , but not by adding anti-Spl antibody ( comparing lanes 4-6 ) .
When labeled probe containing mutant GAS was used , two bands moved faster ( Zanes 8 ) ; they were supershifted by anti-Spl antibody but not by anti-STAT1 antibody ( comparing lanes 10 and 11 ) .
Together , these results demonstrate that the first two Sp1 sites and the GAS site are functionally important , and that the second Spl site overlaps with a GAS site to form a novel overlapping GAS/Spl element .
This GAS/Spl element is recognized by both STAT1 and Spl present in the nuclear extracts of treated THP-1 cells .
ATRA Induces STAT1 Expression , While IFN-y Causes the STAT1 to Dimerize and Bind to GAS Element in the ACAT-1 Promoter-STAT1 is a key component of the IFN-y-dependent transcriptional activation complex ( 36 , 37 ) .
We examined the transcript level of STAT1 in control and treated THP-1 cells by RT-PCR .
As shown in Fig .
94 , STATI transcript was not detectable in control THP-1 cells ( Zane 1 ) .
Treating cells with ATRA gave rise to a remarkable increase ( Zane 3 ) , while treating cells with IFN-y caused only a modest increase in the STAT1 transcript ( lane 2 ) .
Treating cells with ATRA with or without IFN-y caused large increases in similar fashion ( Zane 4 ) .
These results indicated that treating THP-1 cells with ATRA , with or without IFN-y , increased significant gene expression of STAT1 .
It has been shown that STAT1 can be activated as a homodimer that moves into the nucleus and acts as a mature transcription factor by binding to the GAS element ( 39 ) .
The dimerization of STAT1 requires tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in a manner triggered by IFN-y ( 38 ) .
Mutant STAT1 ( STAT1-Y701Fm , replacing tyrosine 701 with phenyl-alanine ) is unable to undergo the tyrosine phosphorylation dependent dimerization process ( 40 ) .
To test the possibility that IFN-y may be involved in activating STAT1 to up-regulate the ACAT-1 gene , we prepared wild-type STAT cDNA ( STATI1-Y701 ) and the mutant STAT1 eDNA ( STATI-Y701Fm ) in pRC/CMV vector .
We then transfected these constructs in 20995 A so kp- “ a 3 § 2 £2 .

IFN-y and ATRA synergistically increase ACAT-1 protein and enzyme activity .
A , immunoblotting of ACAT-1 protein from extracts of THP-1 cells were treated in various manners as indicated .
Cells were seeded at 2 X 10°/ml in 60-mm dishes with 7.5 ml of medium , and treated for 40 h with or without IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) , or with ATRA ( 10~ '' M ) or IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) plus ATRA ( 10~° M ) as indicated .
Cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotting were conducted as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
Samples ( 40 ug of protein/ lane ) were freshly prepared with SDS .
The membrane was incubated with DM10 ( 0.5 ug/ml ) as the primary antibody .
The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system and autora-diography .
The intensities of bands were determined by using the UVP Labwork software ( UVP Inc. ) .
The data are expressed as relative protein using the value in untreated THP-1 cells as 1.0 .
The ratios of the protein from cells treated in various manners as indicated were shown at the bottom panel .
B , ACAT activity assayed in vitro .
AC29 , 25RA , and THP-1 cells were cultured at 2 X 10°/ml in 60-mm dishes with 7.5 ml of medium and treated for 40 h with or without IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) , or with ATRA ( 10~° M ) , or with IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) plus ATRA ( 10~° mM ) as indicated .
ACAT activities were assayed as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
The data are expressed as relative ACAT activity using the value in untreated THP-1 cells as 1.0 .
The ACAT specific activity in untreated cell extracts was 74 pmol/mg/min .
dividually into the IFN-y and/or ATRA-treated THP-1 cells , and measured ACAT-1 P1 promoter activity .
As shown in Fig .
9B , when cells were treated with IFN-y alone , a significant enhancement of the P1 promoter was seen when these cells were transfected with wild-type STAT1 cDNA .
The enhancement was not seen when mutant STAT1 cDNA was used ( comparing the sizes of the second bar in the STATI-Y701 panel with the second bar in the STATI-Y701Fm panel ) .
These results imply that IFN-y is involved in stimulating the phosphorylation of STAT1 , causing the dimeric form of STAT1 to bind to the GAS element .
To further test this interpretation , we treated THP-1 cells with IFN-y alone , and transfected with or without the wild-type or the mutant STATZI cDNAs , then prepared the nuclear extracts of these cells and performed EMSAs .

STAT1 cDNA ( comparing lane 6 with lane 2 ) .
These two bands were not detectable in extracts of cells transfected with the mutant STATI cDNA ( comparing lane 10 with lane 2 ) .
Results of the gel supershift assays using anti-STAT1 and anti-Spl antibodies confirmed that these two bands were complexes resulting from specific interactions of STAT1 and Spl with the ACAT-1 P1 promoter ( Zanes 8 and 9 ) .
Additional EMSAs , using the nuclear extracts from control ( untransfected ) THP-1 cells or from mutant cDNA-transfected cells showed that the two bands described above migrated faster .
These bands were not supershifted with anti-STAT1 antibodies , but were supershifted with anti-Spl antibodies ( comparing lane 4 and 5 with 12 and 13 ) .
These results showed that the GAS site , not the Spl sites , formed specific complexes with the wild-type STAT1 after activation by IFN-y through the tyrosine-phosphorylation dependent mechanism .
DISCUSSION ACAT-1 mRNAs and protein contents are significantly increased during the human monocyte-macrophage differentiation process in vitro ( 21 , 41 ) .
Its protein content is amply present in macrophage-derived foam cells localized in the human atherosclerotic lesion , implying that up-regulation of the ACAT-1 gene plays important roles in macrophage foam cell formation in atherosclerosis ( 42 ) .
In mouse macrophages , ACAT-1 message was found to be up-regulated by cells with IFN-y ( 12 ) .
The molecular basis of these findings has not been pursued at the gene transcription level .
In our current work , we showed that IFN-y increased ACAT-1 mRNAs and protein contents during the human blood monocyte-macrophage differentiation process .
We then found that treating the human monocyte-like THP-1 cells with ATRA and IFN-y caused up-regulation of ACAT-1 gene expression in cell-type specific man-ner .
To elucidate the molecular basis of this finding , we identified a 159-bp core region with Spl elements that is responsible for the P1 promoter activity .
This region also contains an IFN-y activated sequence ( GAS ) that overlaps exactly with the second Spl element ( TGGGCGGAA , with the Spl site underlined ) .
To our knowledge , this is the first example in literature describing an overlapping SpLGAS site .

STAT1 is involved in the synergistic effect of IFN-y and ATRA .
Total RNAs were prepared from THP-1 cells treated for 40 h with or without IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) , or ATRA ( 10~° M ) , or IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) plus ATRA ( 10~° M ) as indicated .
A , quantitation by RT-PCR ( 30 cycles ) .
Primers were used for STAT1 and the GAPDH cDNAs as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
Control experiments indicated that between cycles 25 and 35 , the IFN-y receptor transcripts and the STAT1 transcript could be estimated semiquantitatively by RT-PCR ( data not shown ) .
B , THP-1 cells were co-transfected with the Lue construct containing the wild-type ACAT-1 Pl promoter core region , and the wild-type STAT1 ( indicated as STAT1-Y701 ) , or the mutant STAT1 ( indicated as STAT1-Y701F 'm ) , or the empty vector ( indicated as control ) .
7 h after transfection , the cells were treated in various manners as indicated for 40 h. The luciferase activities of treated cell extracts were then determined in the same way as described in the legend to Fig .

C , EMSAs using nuclear extracts from the transfected THP-1 cells treated for 40 h with IFN-y ( 100 units/ml ) .
The wild-type 159-bp core region DNA was labeled as probe ; 1 X 10 '' dpm of labeled probe was used for each binding reaction .
Lane 1 , *°P-labeled probe alone .
Lane 2 , binding reaction between labeled probe and the nuclear extracts .
Lane 3 , competition by adding 100-fold molar excess of cold probe .
Lane 4 , supershift reaction by adding 1 ul of anti-Spl antibody .
Lane 5 , supershift reaction by adding 1 ul of anti-STAT1 antibody .
For lanes 2-5 , nuclear extracts were from cells transfected with the empty vector .
Lanes 6-9 and 10-13 are results using the same series of reaction conditions as described in lanes 2-5 , but using the nucleic extracts from THP-1 cells transfected with wild-type STAT1 cDNA or with mutant STAT1 eDNA , respectively .
strated that the combination of IFN-y and ATRA is needed to enhance ACAT-1 P1 promoter activity .
Additional experiments using RT-PCR and EMSA showed that ATRA caused large induction of the transcription factor STAT1 , while IFN-y triggered the phosphorylation dependent activation of STAT1 .
The 20997 activated STAT1 then acts by binding to the overlapping GAS Spl site in the ACAT-1 P1 promoter .
Our work dissects the non-sterol-mediated ACAT regulation at the transcriptional level , and provides a molecular mechanism to account for part of the effects of IFN-y in causing macrophage foam cell formation in vitro .
In atherosclerosis , the infiltration of T-cells and monocyte-derived macrophages into the intimal layer of the artery is believed to lead to foam cell formation .
Activated T cells found in human atheroma secrete high levels of IFN-y ( 43 , 44 ) .
IFN-y has been shown to exert certain proatherosclerogenic actions in vitro .
It induces VCAM-1 on endothelial cells ( 45 ) , decreases apoE secretion , and increases uptake of hypertriblyderidemic very low density lipoprotein on macrophages ( 46 ) , induces my-osin heavy chain-II on macrophages and smooth muscle cells ( 47 ) , and induces scavenger receptors on smooth muscle cells during atherogenesis ( 48 ) .
On the other hand , IFN-y has also been shown to exert protective action against atherosclerosis in certain in vitro systems examined ( 49 , 50 ) .
Recently , it has been shown that apoE knockout mice crossed with the IFN-y receptor knockout mice display reductions in lesion size , lipid accumulation , and cellularity ( 51 ) .
In addition , in mice , post-transplant graft arteriosclerosis is associated with the presence of IFN-y ; the serological neutralization or the genetic absence of IFN-y markedly reduces the extent of intimal expansion ( 52 ) .
These results support the notion that IFN-y is pro-atherogenic in vivo .
If this concept holds true , then our finding described here may explain some of the effects of IFN-y on foam cell formation in vivo .
IFN-y exhibits antigrowth or antiproliferation effects in various target cells .
Its effects often occur synergistically with retinoids ( 53 ) .
To cite a few examples , in various myelogenous leukemic cell lines , Gianni et al .
( 54 ) showed that ATRA can bypass IFEN/IFN receptors and induce the expression of IFN-regulated genes including STATI ; Matikainen et al .
( 55 , 56 ) showed that ATRA causes up-regulation of several IFN-specific transcription factors and signal inducers including STAT , and enhances their responsiveness toward IFNs .
The molecular mechanism ( s ) for the synergism observed between ATRA and IFNs in these studies remain to be elucidated .
Our work described here may serve to explain some of the synergistic ac tions of ATRA and IFNs described in these studies .
