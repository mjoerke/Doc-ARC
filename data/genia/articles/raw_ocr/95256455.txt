Adhesion of human monocytes to P-selectin , the most rapidly expressed endothelial tethering factor , increased the secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) by the leukocytes when they were stimulated with platelet-activating factor .
Increased cytokine secretion was specifically inhibited by G1 , an anti-P-selectin mAb that prevents P-selectin from binding to its ligand ( P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 ) on myeloid cells .
Moreover , tethering by P-selectin specifically enhanced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor- « B ( NF-xB ) , a transcription factor required for expression of MCP TNF-a , and other immediate-early genes .
These results demonstrate that P-selectin , through its ligands on monocytes , may locally regulate cytokine secretion in inflamed tissues . ( J .

response genes when the cells adhere to plastic or to extracellular matrix proteins ( 3 ) .
Some of the IE genes code for inflammatory cytokines .
Adhesion of monocytes to plastic or to purified immobilized extracellular proteins differentially induces patterns of gene expression depending on the specific surface ( 3 ) .
While mRNA accumulates in these adherent monocytes , the cytokines themselves , which include interleukin-1/3 ( IL-1/ ) and TNF-a , are not secreted unless there is a `` *second stimulus '' such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 3 ) .
Thus , surface adhesion may cause futile activation of IE genes in monocytes unless there is coordinate action of a signaling molecule that stimulates completion of the synthetic process .
Adhesion-dependent induction of mRNA for IE gene products is mediated by 3 , integrins on the monocyte surface ( 4 ) and involves rapid phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues ( 3 , 5 ) .
Specific transcription factors , including NF- « B , are also required ( 3 ) .
In contrast to interactions of monocytes with extracellular matrix proteins , little is known about cell-cell interactions that influence signaling of cytokine genes .
Ligation of LFA-3 on monocytes by purified , immobilized CD2 caused secretion of IL-1/ } 3 and TNF-a , suggesting that adhesion of T cells to monocytes via this ligand pair transduces signals and serves as a `` physiologic trigger '' for cytokine generation ( 6 ) .
Contact between monocytes and stimulated endothelial cells is a critical control point in inflammation and occurs before the adhesion of monocytes to matrix proteins or to T cells at extravascular sites .
P-selectin , the adhesion factor most rapidly expressed by endothelial cells ( 1 , 7 ) , tethers human monocytes * and is present on endothelial surfaces after oxidant attack ( 8-11 ) and in atherosclerotic and rheumatoid lesions ( 12 , 13 ) .
In this study we explored the generation of cytokines by monocytes adherent to P-selectin .

Measurements of cytokine secretion .
16-mm plastic wells ( Costar Corp. , Cambridge , MA ) were left uncoated or were incubated overnight at 4°C with 300 ul of HBSS containing 10 ug/ml of human serum albumin in HBSS ( HSA ) , anti-ICAM-3 , or 2.5 ug/ml of P-selectin as described previously ( 7 ) .
After the plates were blocked with 5 mg/ml of HSA ( 4 h at 25°C ) , monocytes ( 1 x 105/ml ) resuspended in serum-free M199 medium were added to the wells in the presence of buffer ( HSA ) , PAF ( 1 nM to 14M ) , or LPS ( 1 ng/ml to 1 ug/ml ) .
The cells were incubated on each surface for 8 h unless otherwise indicated .
After this incubation period , the supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min .
The cell-free supernatants were collected and stored at -70°C for subsequent analysis .
Transfected or wild-type CHO cells were grown to confluence , and monocytes ( 1 x 10®/ml ) in M199 medium were added to each mono-layer .
After the addition of vehicle ( HSA ) , PAF , or LPS , the supernatants were collected at the end of 8 h and MCP-1 and TNF-a concentrations were measured as described above .

Adherence studies .
Monocyte adherence to uncoated plastic or surfaces coated with P-selectin , albumin , or anti-ICAM-3 was determined by a modification of our method for neutrophil adherence ( 20 ) , as described .
Assays for NF-KB translocation to the nucleus .
Translocation of the nuclear transcription factor , NF- « B , from cytoplasm to the nucleus was examined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) and im-munocytochemistry .
EMSA .
Monocytes adherent to immobilized P-selectin or control surfaces were stimulated with vehicle ( HSA ) , PAF , or LPS for 2 h unless indicated otherwise .
Nuclear extracts were isolated according to the method of Kitchens et al .
( 21 ) .
Nuclear protein ( 1 ug , 1-4 ul ) was mixed with a reaction mixture that contained , in 10 l of final volume , 1 ul BSA , 2 ul buffer ( 20 % glycerol , 5 mM MgCl , , 2.5 mM EDTA , 2.5 mM DTT , 50 mM Tris-HCI , 0.25 mg/ml of poly and balance ( L1 ) of dH ; 0 .
After incubating the reaction mixture at 25°C for 10 min , we added 1 pl of a P-labeled « B consensus oligonucleotide with the following sequence : 5'-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3 ' 3'-TCA ACT CCC CTG AAA GGG TCC G-5 ' .
The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min , the reaction was stopped by adding 1 pl of gel loading 10 % buffer ( 250 mM Tris-HCI , 0.2 % bromophenol blue , 0.2 % xylene cyanol , and 40 % glycerol ) , and the reaction mixture was loaded onto a nondenaturing , 4 % acrylamide ( 80:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide ) gel that had been `` prerun '' for 30 min .
Electrophoresis was performed for 3 h at 100 V in 0.5 % TBE running buffer .
The gel was dried onto paper under vacuum at 80°C for 1 h and visualized by exposure to high performance autoradiog-raphy film ( Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Unlabeled « B 2298 Weyrich , Mcintyre , McEver , Prescott , and Zimmerman oligonucleotide , added to the reaction mixture before the addition of *P-labeled « B consensus oligonucleotide , competitively inhibited its association with nuclear NF- « B ( not shown ) .
Immunocytochemical analysis .
Monocytes adherent to P-selectin or to control surfaces were examined at 2 h unless indicated otherwise .
The primary antibody was a rabbit polyclonal IgG against NF- « B p65 used at a dilution of 1:100 ( 1 pg/ml ) .
A Vectastain ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories Inc. , Burlingame , CA ) was used for detection as described previously ( 9 , 10 , 22 ) .
Control slides included omission of the primary antibody or omission of the secondary antibody .
Slides were viewed and photographed by Normarski interference contrast optics using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope ( Thornwood , NY ) .
Enzyme-linked immunoassay ( ELISA ) .
MCP-1 and TNF-a concentrations were measured using minor modifications of ELISAs previously described by Evanoff et al .
( 23 ) .
Both ELISAs were specific and did not crossreact with other cytokines tested ( i.e. , IL-8 , GM-CSF , RANTES , or macrophage inflammatory protein-la ) .
Results Adhesion of monocytes to immobilized P-selectin potentiates stimulated secretion of MCP-1 .
We first measured secretion of cytokines as the endpoint most relevant to the inflammatory state in vivo .
There was little or no secretion of MCP-1 or of several other cytokines coded by IE genes when monocytes were incubated in suspension without stimulation , '' consistent with the observation that there is little or no mRNA for cytokines in resting monocytes ( 3 ) .
Incubation of monocytes on immobilized P-selectin did not induce secretion of MCP-1 above the levels found when the cells were incubated on plastic or albumin , even though there was robust adherence ( Fig .
1 A ) , and the levels of MCP-1 released were not greater than those of monocytes incubated in suspension without stimulation ( not shown ) .
The conditions we used to coat the surfaces with P-selectin result in maximal adhesion of monocytes , '' and increasing the concentration of P-selectin by 10-fold in the buffer used to coat the wells did not further increase the secretion of MCP-1 .
These findings indicated that tethering of the cells to P-selectin does not alone induce MCP-1 secretion .
We then asked if adhesion of monocytes to P-selectin alters MCP-1 secretion in response to a known agonist .
We chose PAF , a biologically active phospholipid , because it is coexpressed with P-selectin on endothelial surfaces and mediates juxtacrine activation of tethered leukocytes ( 20 , 24 ) .
Also , synthesis of PAF by monocytes is enhanced by tethering to P-selectin under some conditions , '' and PAF and MCP-1 may have synergistic auto-crine effects ( 25 ) .
PAF was a weak or ineffective agonist for monocyte IE gene expression when the cells were stimulated in suspension ( MCP-1 = 50+6 pg/ml ) .
In contrast , PAF ( 1 nM to 1 uM ) induced a 10-fold increase in MCP-1 secretion by monocytes adherent to P-selectin ( Fig .
1 B ) .
There was no enhancement of PAF-induced MCP-1 secretion in monocytes adherent to the control surfaces .
Although monocytes were potently stimulated by LPS , '' contamination of our P-selectin preparation by LPS was excluded as the cause for enhancement of MCP-1 secretion ( Fig .
1 B ) by the following : ( a ) polymixin B ( 10 ug/ml ) , an LPS inactivating agent , was present in all experimental conditions ; ( b ) our purified P-selectin contained < 1 ng/ml of LPS , a 3 .

Thus .
the regulatory effects of P-selectin on MCP-1 ( Fig .

This again suggests that adhesion to P-selectin is insufficient to directly signal cytokine secretion .
When stimulated with PAF , monocytes adherent to P-selectin secreted levels of TNF-a that were eightfold greater than those of monocytes adherent to albumin or plastic ( Fig .
4 ) .
Exposure of the adherent cells to PAF for periods as short as 30 min followed by removal of the incubation medium was sufficient to elicit TNF-a secretion , indicating that brief contact with the signaling molecule is sufficient for cytokine production ( not shown ) .
Adherence of monocytes to CHO cells that express P-selectin also elicited an increase in TNF-a secretion in response to PAF ( fourfold greater than nonstimulated controls ) .
PAF did not induce TNF-a secretion by monocytes adherent to wild-type CHO cells .
P-selectin facilitates NF-kB translocation in adherent monocytes .
Translocation of a transcription factor , NF- « B , to the nucleus is a key mechanism in adhesion-dependent induction of a variety of IE genes ( 3 ) and is required for MCP-1 ( 27 ) and TNF-a ( 28 ) expression .
We examined the distribution of NF-KB in adherent monocytes using microscopic immunolo-calization of an antibody against the p65 subunit ( 29 ) and by EMSA .
Monocytes tethered by P-selectin remained round , indicating that a signal for cellular spreading had not been delivered , and NF- « B was concentrated in the cell cytoplasm with minimal nuclear staining ( Fig .
5 A ) .
EMSA demonstrated that there was a small , but discernible , increase in nuclear NF- « B ( pS50-p65 ) in monocytes adherent to purified P-selectin compared with those on immobilized albumin ( Fig .
6 ) .
Consistent with this small increase , MCP-1 release was minimal ( Fig .
1 B ) .
When monocytes tethered to P-selectin were stimulated with PAF , NF- « B was robustly translocated to the nucleus as shown by EMSA ( Fig .
6 ) and immunocytochemistry ( Fig .
5 B ) .
This was accompanied by dramatic cell spreading and polarization 2300 Weyrich , Mcintyre , McEver , Prescott , and Zimmerman at Figure 5 .

PAF-induced nuclear translocation of NF- « B was evident when monocytes adhered to P-selectin for periods as short as 30 min , indicating that brief contact between P-selectin and its ligands on monocytes is sufficient to facilitate NF- « B translocation and , potentially , to initiate cytokine generation ( not shown ) .
Incubation of monocytes on albumin-coated surfaces caused little or no nuclear translocation assessed by microscopic analysis ( not shown ) , consistent with results using EMSA ( Fig .
6 ) .
We also examined the possibility that interaction with surfaces nonspecifically facilitates NF- « B translocation in monocytes using a different approach .
An immobilized mAb against ICAM-3 , a surface molecule present on resting monocytes ( 30 ) , gave cell binding that was equal to that on immobilized P-selectin ( 82 % of monocytes adhered to anti-ICAM-3 compared with 78 % to immobilized P-selectin ; n = 2 ) .
However , there was no translocation of NF- « B in monocytes adherent to anti-ICAM-3 in the basal state ' or when stimulated by PAF ( Fig .
5 C ) , although activation signals had been delivered as indicated by cellular spreading ( Fig .
5 C ) .
Similarly , secretion of MCP-1 by monocytes bound to anti-ICAM-3 and stimulated with PAF was at background levels ( 48 +9 pg/ml ; n = 4 ) ( compare with Fig .
1 B ) .
Discussion Our studies demonstrate that adhesion of monocytes to P-selectin alters events that are critical for the expression of IE genes and for secretion of products of these genes , inflammatory cytokines .
Thus , adhesion of monocytes to P-selectin presented by stimulated endothelial cells or by platelets , which also express it , '' can potentially influence cytokine generation early in in 4 .
We have found that stimulated platelets enhance NF- « B translocation in monocytes , and cytokine secretion , by a P-selectin-dependent mecha-nism .

Cell-cell interactions at vascular interfaces may establish levels or patterns of IE gene expression before the time monocytes encounter matrix proteins or other signals in the extravascular milieu .
Activation of leukocytes after adhesion to P-selectin is controversial ( 31 ) .
Earlier , it was reported that binding of purified P-selectin to polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) inhibits stimulated activation responses ( 32 , 33 ) , suggesting that it delivers negative signals .
In contrast , we found that tethering of PMNs to purified P-selectin , or to transfected cells that express P-selectin , allows rapid activation events ( inside-out signaling of B ; integrins , polarization , priming for enhanced granular se-cretion ) to proceed and is important for efficient activation of PMNs by juxtacrine signals at the surfaces of stimulated endothelial cells ( 20 , 24 ) .
We then explored activation of monocytes and found that their adhesion to P-selectin , via constitutive surface ligands , enhances secretion of MCP-1 and TNF-a when the cells are stimulated with PAF ( Fig .
1 B and Fig .
4 ) .
Specific inhibition by mAb G1 ( Fig .
3 ) suggests that the critical ligand on the monocyte surface may be P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 ( 34 ) , since mAb G1 inhibits binding of P-selectin to purified P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 ( 26 ) .
Adhesion of monocytes to P-selectin caused them to be responsive to PAF , whereas adhesion to other surfaces did not ( Figs .
1 and 4 ) , and PAF was not effective as an agonist when monocytes were in suspen-sion .
This suggests that a major consequence of adhesion of monocytes to P-selectin is integration , or amplification , of signals delivered through the serpentine receptor for PAF and , potentially , through other such receptors .
While mean levels of MCP-1 and TNF-a were slightly higher when monocytes were tethered to P-selectin in the absence of PAF , the values were not consistently greater than the background levels found when monocytes were incubated on control surfaces .
This suggests that binding of P-selectin to ligands on the monocyte is by itself insufficient to induce the coordinate events that lead to MCP-1 and TNF-a secretion without the action of a signaling molecule such as PAF .
In contrast , it was reported recently that P-selectin directly signals expression of tissue factor ( mRNA and surface activity ) , albeit at much lower levels than when the monocytes were stimulated with LPS ( 35 ) .
Activation of specific genes and processing of their products in monocytes is differentially regulated by adhesion ( 3 ) ; therefore , it is possible that expression of proteins other than MCP-1 and TNF-a is directly induced by tethering to P-selectin .
To begin to explore mechanisms by which adhesion to P-selectin influences cytokine gene expression in monocytes , we focused on its effect on the transcription factor , NF- « B .
In resting cells , NF-KB is located in the cytoplasm ( 29 ) .
With an appropriate activating stimulus , it is released from an inhibitory factor , IxB , and rapidly translocates to the nucleus .
This event is followed by binding of NF- « B to « B sequences in promoter and enhancer regions of a variety of genes , where it regulates their transcription together with other factors ( 29 ) .
NF- « B is a critical regulator of IE genes in monocytes ( 3 ) and is required for .
MCP-1 ( 27 ) and TNF-a expression ( 28 ) .
We found that adhesion of monocytes to P-selectin alone caused a small but consistent translocation of NF- « B ( p50-p65 ) ; however , nuclear translocation was enhanced dramatically when the cells were stimulated with PAF ( Fig .
5 ) .
We have not yet examined mRNA levels for MCP-1 and TNF-a , but the degree of NF-KB translocation in control and PAF-stimulated cells correlated P-Selectin Regulates Cytokine Secretion 2301 with the magnitude of cytokine generation ( Figs .
1-4 ) .
This suggests that facilitated transfer of NF- « B may be one mechanism by which adhesion to P-selectin amplifies MCP-1 and TNF-a secretion by stimulated monocytes .
Enhanced NF- « B translocation was evident in stimulated monocytes 30 min after adhesion to P-selectin suggesting that brief contact with P-selectin , which occurs when the leukocytes interact with endothelial cells during transmigration in vivo , may be sufficient to induce this component of the response .
When monocytes adhere to inflamed endothelium , it is possible that P-selectin acts in a costimulatory fashion with other adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 or vascular cell adhesion molecule- ?
( VCAM-1 ) .
VCAM-1 is proposed to regulate IE gene expression by binding to on monocytes ( 4 ) .
Although surface expression of P-selectin is often more transient than that of VCAM-1 and occurs in response to a different spectrum of agonists ( 1 ) , it is present for prolonged periods after oxidant attack ( 8-11 ) and in atherosclerotic and rheumatoid lesions ( 12 , 13 ) , as is VCAM-1 .
Interaction of monocytes with ICAM-1 , which is constitutively present and is upregulated on stimulated endothelial cells , caused generation of macrophage inflammatory protein-la & after 24 h ( 36 ) .
Pre-sumably , this occurred by binding of 3 ; ( CD11/CD18 ) integrins on the monocyte plasma membranes to ICAM-1 , although outside-in signaling through /3 ; integrins is not thought to be sufficient to induce IE genes ( 4 ) and adhesion of monocytes to purified ICAM-1 did not alone signal IL-1/3 or TNF-a secretion ( 6 ) .
Taken together , however , these observations suggest that binding of P-selectin to ligands on monocytes , together with ligation of 3 , or 3 ; integrins on their surfaces , may influence IE genes in concert , setting specific patterns of expression .
In T lymphocytes , a soluble P-selectin chimera differentially altered GM-CSF and IL-8 secretion when a ligand for P-selectin was first induced by culture and the cells were then costimulated for 48 h with an anti-T cell receptor antibody ( 37 ) .
For monocytes , coordinate stimulation may occur when they bind to P-selectin and to ligands for integrins , or by adhesion to P-selectin and action of a signaling molecule such as PAF .
