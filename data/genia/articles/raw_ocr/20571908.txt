Using a reporter system to detect interaction of CREB and CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) , in this study we found that CREB binds to CBP only by engagement of both CD3 and CD28 .
CD3/CD28-promoted CREB-CBP interaction was dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) IV in addition to the previously identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway .
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase , CaMKIV , and p38 MAPK were also the kinases involved in CREB Ser'* > phosphorylation induced by CD3/CD28 .
A reconstitution experiment illustrated that optimum CREB-CBP interaction and CREB frans-activation were attained when these three kinase pathways were simultaneously activated in T cells .
Our results demonstrate that coordinated activation of different kinases leads to full activation of CREB .
Notably , CD28 ligation activated p38 MAPK and CaMKIV , the kinases stimulated by CD3 engagement , suggesting that CD28 acts by increasing the activation extent of p38 MAPK and CaMKIV .
These results support the model of a minimum activation threshold for CREB-CBP interaction that can be reached only when both CD3 and CD28 are stimulated .
The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 166 : 284-292. yelic AMP -responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) mediates cAMP-responsive gene expression in a well-characterized scheme ( 1-3 ) .
CREB binds to the cAMP-responsive element ( CRE ) located in the promoter of most cAMP-inducible genes ( 4 , 5 ) .
The phosphorylation of CREB Ser'* > by protein kinase A ( 6 , 7 ) promotes the binding of the kinase-induc-ible domain of CREB to the KIX domain of CREB binding protein ( CBP ) through electrostatic interaction ( 8-11 ) .
CBP then initiates the transcription of CRE-containing genes by the associated RNA polymerase II and histone acetyl transferase activities ( 9 , 12 ) .
Ser'* > phosphorylation hence plays a critical role in CREB activation .
Mutation of serine to alanine at position 133 converts CREB into a dominant negative transcriptional regulator .
In addition to cAMP , CREB is activated by Ca** , growth fac-tors , and stress signals ( 1-3 ) .

Copyright © 2001 by The American Association of Immunologists CREB kinase candidates have been identified .
The calcium signaling that activates CREB can be traced back to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I ( CaMKI ) , CaMKII , and CaMKIV , which are activated by the increase in the calcium/calmodulin complex .
Even though CaMKI and CaMKII phosphorylate CREB in vitro , CaMKI is not translocated into the nucleus , and CaMKII does not activate CREB transcriptionally ( 13-15 ) .
CaMKIV is thus the kinase that mediates calcium-induced CREB phosphorylation in vivo .
In the other major pathway involved in CREB activation , the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) kinase ( MAPKK ) -extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) cascade , the downstream p90 '' phosphorylates CREB ( 16 ) .
Other ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) family members , RSK1 and RSK3 , also phosphorylate CREB ( 17 ) .
Along the p38 MAPK cascade , which is the third major signaling pathway that contributes to CREB activation , MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 mediates stress- and fibroblast growth factor-induced phosphorylation of CREB ( 18 ) .
CREB is also directly phosphorylated by mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 ( 19 ) , the kinase activated by stress stimuli in the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway or by growth factor in the ERK-de-pendent cascade .
A third CREB kinase controlled by p38/SAPK2 , RSK-B , has been identified ( 20 ) .
In addition to the calcium , ERK , and p38 signal pathways , CREB is phosphorylated by Akt ( 21 ) .
The CREB analogue CREM can also be phosphorylated by PKC and p70 S6 kinase ( 22 , 23 ) .
The presence of a large number of CREB kinases indicates that phosphorylation of CREB may be mediated by two or more kinases under the same stimulus .
For example , nerve growth factor-induced CREB phosphorylation involves both RSK and MAPK-activated protein kinase ( 17 ) .
TCR engagement leads to CREB phosphorylation ( 24 , 25 ) .
The transcriptional activation of CREB is essential for T cell activation and development .
Blockage of CREB transcriptional activation by T cell-specific transgenic expression of the dominant negative CREB or dominant negative CaMKIV greatly impairs thymocyte proliferation and IL-2 production ( 26 , 27 ) .
Moreover , genetic knockout of CREB abolishes « f T cell development in mice ( 28 ) .
0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology CREB is required for the expression of proliferating cell nuclear Ag ( PCNA ) which contributes to cell cycle progression ( 29 ) .
CREB may also participate in Th cell development through regulated expression of y-IFN ( 30 ) .
We previously illustrated that full CREB activation , similar to T cell activation , requires dual signals from CD3 and CD28 ( 25 ) .
CD28 is a T cell-specific cell surface molecule that interacts with B7 on APCs .
The costimulation signal from CD28 acts in synergy with the mitogenic signal from TCR to promote cell cycle progression and to increase IL-2 secretion ( for reviews , see Refs .
31 , 32 ) .
CD28 costimulation also prevents induction of T cell tolerance ( 33 ) and cell death ( 34 ) .
Even though the essential role of CD28 is well recognized , the CD28-mediated costimulatory signals are not well understood .
CD28-mediated signals are known to involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) ( 35-37 ) , but PI 3-kinase alone can not account for all CD28-mediated costimulatory events ( 38-40 ) .
CD28 costimulation results in full activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) ( 41 ) , yet signals other than JNK are required for the induction of IL-2 production ( 42 ) .
Additional candidates of CD28 costimulatory signals include IB kinase ( 43 ) and p38 MAPK ( 44-46 ) .
Engagement of both CD3 and CD28 also induces PDE7 , which decreases cAMP and increases T cell activation ( 47 ) .
In the present study we found that in addition to ERK , p38 MAPK and CaMKIV are activated by CD3/CD28 .
ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV are required for both CREB-CBP interaction and CREB frans-activation , which were significantly compromised when any single kinase cascade was inhibited .
Our findings suggest that multiple signals are required to coordinate a stable CREB-CBP interaction .

One-tenth volume of 3 M KCI was then added , and the lysates were rocked at 4°C for 30 min .
The same isolation procedures as those for the nuclear extract were then followed .
Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
Immunoblots Cell extracts ( 10-30 pg ) were resolved by 10 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) for 4 h at 20 V. Membranes were washed in rinse buffer ( PBS with 2 % Tween 20 ) at room temperature for 15 min and incubated in blocking buffer ( 5 % nonfat milk in rinse buffer ) for 1.5 h. The membrane was then incubated with 0.1 ug/ml anti-phosphorylated CREB or 2 ug/ml anti-CREB .
After washing , the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) in blocking buffer for 1.5 h. After washing three times , membranes were developed by ECL Western blot detection reagents ( Amersham , Aylesbury , U.K. ) .
The developed membrane was detected using x-ray film and was quantitated using a densitometer ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Transfection ELA cells ( 1.6 X 10 '' ) were washed once with STBS ( 25 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 137 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0.6 mM Na , HPO , , 0.7 mM CaCl , , and 0.5 mM and incubated with a total of 10 pg of DNA in 1.2 ml of STBS containing 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran for 20 min at room temperature .
One microgram of pGreen Lantern-1 ( Life Technologies ) was included in all transfections .
EL4 cells were then treated with 15 % DMSO for 3 min and washed once with STBS .
The transfection efficiency was determined 24 h after transfection by counting the fraction of green fluorescence cells .

The reaction mixtures were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and were quantitated by PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Results Requirement of CD3/CD28 costimulation for CREB-CBP interaction We used reporters pGAL-CBD and pVP16-CREB ( 50 ) to measure the interaction of CREB and CBP ( Fig .
14 ) .
pGAL-CBD encodes the fusion protein of Gal , ; , , and the CBD of CBP ( aa 461-682 ) .
The activation of pG , B-CAT upon binding of CBP to CREB was used as a readout for the assay .
Stimulation through CD3 alone or CD28 alone failed to promote the binding of CREB to CBP ( Fig .
1B ) .
CREB-CBP interaction was detectable only upon costimulation of CD3 and CD28 .

CD3/CD28 costimulation-promoted CREB-CBP interaction involves ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV pathways Inhibitors for different kinases were used to assess the contribution of each kinase to CREB-CBP interaction .
As illustrated in Fig .

CAT activities were determined 24 h after T cell activation .
The inhibitors used were PD 098059 ( PD ; 10 uM ) , KN-62 ( 10 uM ) , KN-93 ( 10 uM ) , and SB 203580 ( 10 uM ) .
B , CREB-CBP interaction was not mediated by PKA , p70 S6 kinase , or PI 3-kinase .
EL4 T cells were treated as described in A with the following inhibitors : LY 294002 ( LY ; 10 M ) , H89 ( 1 pM ) , calphostin C ( CC ; 2 M ) , or rapamycin ( R ; 50 ng/ml ) .
C , ELA T cells were pretreated with PD 098059 , KN-62 , SB 203580 , or 0.1 % DMSO ( control ) for 20 min .
T cells were then stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , and the cell extracts were prepared 20 min after activation .
ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV activities were determined by immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with specific Abs .
One hundred to 200 ug of lysate was precipitated with 1 ug of anti-ERK2 C-14 Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti-p38 « Ab ( 59 ) , or anti-CaMKIV C-20 Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) followed by protein A-Sepharose .
The kinase activity of the immune complexes was determined by the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein ( MBP ) for ERK , GST-ATF-2 ; , ; , , for p38 MAPK , and GST-CREB for CaMKIV , as resolved on SDS-PAGE .
in reducing CREB-CBP interaction .
In contrast , CaMKII-specific inhibitor KN-93 did not interfere with the binding of CREB to CBP ( Fig .
24 ) .
The inhibition by KN-62 , but not KN-93 , thus suggests the involvement of CaMKIV in CREB frans-activation .
6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology The inhibitor SB 203590 ( 10 uM ) was found to suppress > 60 % of the CREB-CBP interaction .
A combination of PD 98059 , KN 62 , and SB 203580 completely blocked CD3/CD28-promoted CREB-CBP binding ( Fig .
24 ) .
The specificity of PD 98059 , SB 203590 , and KN-62 was confirmed using kinase assays ( Fig .
2C ) .
PD 98059 selectively inhibited the activation ERK , but not p38 MAPK and CaMKIV , induced by CD3/CD28 .
Similarly , SB 203580 antagonized only 38 MAPK and KN-62 specifically suppressed CaMKIV .
In contrast , inhibition of PI 3-kinase , protein kinase A , protein kinase C , and p70 S6 kinase only weakly interfered with CREB-CBP interaction ( Fig .
2B ) .
Because PI 3-kinase is known to be activated by CD28 ( 35-37 ) , and PI 3-kinase activation promotes CREB phosphorylation ( 21 ) , we also examined binding with another PI 3-kinase inhibitor , wortmannin , and did not detect any inhibitory effect on CREB-CBP binding ( Not shown ) .
Therefore , CD28 costimulation-induced CREB-CBP binding is mainly dependent on the ERK , CaMKIV , and p38 MAPK pathways .
CD3/CD28-costimulated CREB trans-activation requires ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV pathways Because CREB-CBP binding may not necessarily represent the activation of CREB ( 24 , 60 , 61 ) , we further used CRE-CAT to assess the transcription activity of CREB ( Fig .
3 ) .
We previously illustrated that CRE-CAT is activated by CD3 plus CD28 , but not by CD3 or CD28 alone ( 25 ) .
The signaling requirement of the CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced CRE-CAT expression was similarly determined .
The presence of PD 98059 or KN-62 reduced the activation of CRE-CAT by 35 % , while SB 203580 suppressed > 45 % of CRE-CAT expression .
The combination of PD 98059 , KN-62 , and SB 203580 abrogated the activation of CRE-CAT stimulated by CD3/CD28 ( Fig .
3 ) .
ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV were similarly involved in the trans-activation of CREB induced by CD3/CD28 .

ELA T cells were transfected with CRE-CAT and pGreen Lantern-1 , and then activated with CD3/CD28 24 h later .
Different inhibitors were added immediately after T cell activation .
CAT activity was determined after another 24 h. 287 p38 MAPK and CaMKIV are activated by CD3 or CD28 alone and are further stimulated by CD3/CD28 costimulation We next determined the activation of MAPKK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV when T cells were stimulated by CD3 , CD28 , or both ( Fig .
4 ) .
ERK is activated by CD3 and is not affected by CD28 costimulation ( 41 ) .
Fig .
44 confirms that CD28 engagement did not stimulate ERK .
ERK activation was identical when T cells were stimulated by CD3 or by CD3/CD28 ( Fig .
4B ) .
We and others have shown that p38 MAPK activity is stimulated by CD3 and is further enhanced by CD3/CD28 costimulation ( 43 , 44 ) .
Here we observed that p38 MAPK was also activated by CD28 alone ( Fig .
4A ) .
CD28-stimulated p38 activation was slightly lower than that stimulated by CD3 ( Fig .
4B ) .
Both CD3 and CD28 ligation alone led to activation of CaMKIV to a similar extent .
CaMKIV activation was further augmented by CD3/CD28 costimulation ( Fig .

Of the three kinases required for CREB-CBP binding , p38 MAPK and CaMKIV were activated by both CD3 and CD28 alone .

Because the ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV pathways mediate CREB phosphorylation induced by other stimuli ( 13-20 ) , we further examined whether all three of these signaling pathways were involved in CREB phosphorylation induced by CD3/CD28 .
Stimulation of T cells by CD3 promoted the Ser'* > phosphorylation of CREB ( Fig .
54 ) .
CD3-induced phosphorylation was partially inhibited by PD 98059 and SB 203580 , and was almost abolished by KN-62 ( Fig .
5A ) , suggesting that all three kinase cascades are involved in CD3-induced CREB phosphorylation .
CD28 engagement also led to extensive CREB phosphorylation at Ser'* > ( Fig .

In contrast , CD28-induced CREB phosphorylation was suppressed by SB 203580 and KN-62 ( Fig .

Signal requirements for CD3/CD28-induced CREB phosphorylation were similar to those for CREB-CBP binding .
Nuclear extracts were prepared 1 h after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 treatment of ELA T cells in the presence of the inhibitors indicated .
The concentrations of the inhibitors were the same as those in Fig .
2 .
Thirty micrograms of each extract was resolved by 10 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane .
The membrane was detected with anti-phosphorylated CREB ( Upstate Biotechnology ) or anti-CREB ( 25 ) using ECL reagents ( Amer-sham ) .

5C ) .
CD3/CD28-induced CREB phosphorylation was equally sensitive to PD 98059 , KN-62 , and SB 203580 , suggesting that ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV are also essential for CD3/CD28-induced CREB Ser ' '' > phosphorylation .
The synergistic effect of CD3 and CD28 in CREB phosphorylation is supported by the fact that none of the three inhibitors was as effective as in the inhibition of CREB phosphorylation triggered by sole CD3 or CD28 ( Fig .
5C ) .
Synergistic effect of ERK , p38 MAPK , and Ca '' * on CREB-CBP interaction The observed signaling requirement for CREB-CBP binding was further examined by reconstitution experiments .
ERK was activated through expression of active MKK1 ( 53 ) , p38 MAPK was stimulated through expression of active MKK3b ( 54 ) , and CaMKIV was activated by calcium ionophore A23187 in EL4 T cells .
Kinase assay confirmed the activation of the respective kinase ( Fig .
6A ) .
Transfection of either active MKK1 or MKK3 alone weakly stimulated pGAL-CBD plus pVP16-CREB ( Fig .
6B ) .
MKK1 stimulated a 2-fold activation of pG , B-CAT , while MKK3 led to a 3.6-fold activation .
CREB-CBP interaction was increased to 13.8-fold when stimulated by a combination of MKK1 and A23187 .
Combination of MKK3 plus A23187 further increased the binding of VP16-CREB to Gal4-CBD by 23.9-fold ( Fig .
6B ) .
Up to 37-fold activation of pG , B-CAT was observed when it was stimulated by a combination of MKK1 , MKK3 , and A23187 , indicating a very strong CREB-CBP interaction .
The CREB-CBP binding stimulated by reconstitution of the individual signals was similarly dependent on Ser'* > phosphorylation .
pG , B-CAT was no longer activated when VP16-CREB was replaced with VP16-CREB [ S133A ] ( Fig .
6C ) .
We also tested the ability of JNK and PI 3-kinase , two kinases that are activated by CD3/CD28 , to promote CREB-CBP binding .
JNK was activated by expression of active MKK7 , as indicated by the phosphorylation of GST -c-Jun , and PI 3-kinase was activated by expression of p110* ( 55 ) , as indicated by the phosphorylation of Akt ( data not shown ) .
MKK7 or p110* alone did not stimulate the interaction of CREB and CBP ( Fig .
7 ) .
Moreover , in contrast to the effective activation of pG , B-CAT by the combination of MKK1 and A23187 , the inclusion of PI 3-kinase or MKK7 in the stimulation cocktail did not add to the interaction of CREB and CBP .
Synergistic effect of ERK , p38 MAPK , and Ca '' * on CREB trans-activation The synergistic effect of ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV on CRE-CAT was further examined to evaluate the frans-activation of CREB .
Similar to pVP16-CREB/pGAL-CBD , the expression of CRE-CAT was weakly stimulated by transfection with MKK1 and MKK3b ( Fig .
8A ) .
Expression of either MKK1 or MKK3b in the presence of A23187 further increased the activation of CRE-CAT .
CRE-CAT was optimally activated in the presence of MKK1 , MKK3 , and A123817 .
We also used a promoter of PCNA , in which the activation is dependent on the binding of CREB to its CRE site ( 62 ) .
The same synergistic activation by ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV was observed with PCNA-CAT ( Fig .
8B ) .
The observed activation was CREB dependent , as deletion of the CRE element in the PCNA promoter eliminated the coordinated inducibility mediated by ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV ( Fig .
8C ) .

Discussion In the present study we found that either TCR ( CD3 ) alone or CD28 alone induced phosphorylation of CREB ( Fig .
5 ) , yet costimulation of both receptors was essential for the binding of CREB to CBP ( Fig .
1 ) .
In addition , CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced CREB-CBP interaction involves ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV .
The inhibition of any single kinase significantly prevented CREB-CBP binding ( Fig .
2 ) .
Therefore , signaling from ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV is required for a stable CREB-CBP interaction when costimulated by CD3 and CD28 .
This finding was supported by a reconstitution experiment in which ERK , p38 , and calcium signal acted together to promote strong CREB-CBP binding in T cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
Coordination of these three signals appears to be required for optimum binding of CREB .
We also found that the signal requirements for CREB-CBP binding and for CRE-CAT expression were nearly identical ( Fig .
3 ) .
This is consistent with the suggestion that CRE-mediated gene expression are activated if a stable CREB-CBP complex can be formed ( 63 , 64 ) .

CAT activities were determined 24 h after transfection We have further illustrated that multiple signals are required both in the CREB Ser'* > phosphorylation step ( Fig .
5 ) and in the CREB-CBP binding stage ( Fig .
2 ) stimulated by CD3/CD28 .
ERK , CaMKIV , and p38 were involved in CD3-induced CREB phosphorylation , with a higher contribution from CaMKIV ( Fig .
5A ) .
CaMKIV and p38 were participated in CD28-triggered phosphorylation , with a slightly increased contribution from p38 ( Fig .
5B ) .
Costimulation of CD3 and CD28 led to a synergistically elevated CREB phosphorylation that was almost equally dependent on ERK , CaMKIV , and p38 ( Fig .
5C ) .
Inhibition of ERK , CaMKIV , and p38 each led to a > 50 % decrease in CREB Ser'* > phosphorylation , which is well correlated with the extent of suppression observed on CREB-CBP binding by PD 98059 , KN-62 , or SB 203580 ( Fig .
24 ) .
A full CREB Ser'* > phosphorylation and an optimum CREB-CBP interaction in T cells display a similar dependence on simultaneous activation of ERK , p38 , and CaMKIV .
However , CREB Ser'* > phosphorylation was induced by either anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 alone ( Fig .
5 ) , yet no CREB-CBP interaction was detectable in ELA cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Recent studies have suggested that the frans-activation of CREB may involve multiple stages .
Our results are identical with the report that anti-CD3 stimulates CREB phosphorylation , but not CRE-CAT in Jurkat cells ( 24 ) .
CREB also remains inactive even though Ser'* > phosphorylation is induced by Ca** ( 60 ) .
The activation of CREB needs an additional signal ( 24 , 60 ) .
Therefore , despite the early illustration that the phosphorylation event is directly coupled to CREB transcriptional activation ( 65 ) , phosphorylation of CREB at Ser'* > is not sufficient to activate CRE-dependent gene expression ( 24 , 60 , 66 ) .
It has been suggested that CREB-CBP interaction is uncoupled from CBP activation .
The second signal is to activate CBP or other cofactors for assembly of complete transcriptional complexes or to dissociate a hypothetical CBP inhibitor ( 24 , 60 ) .
The multiple signal requirement for CREB activation may be partly explained by the fact that different signals are required to phosphorylate CREB and to activate CBP .
Alternatively , the possible involvement of Ser'* > -independent mechanisms ( 61 ) in CD3 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 290 A. a 3 C Z C < k= © ( S Ao * 2 2 2 2 2 A XA XA ® E Po Eb pg : > P P A 6 B. z 10 PCNA-CAT e tJ ] & A 6 < S3 C 2 , C. & = PCNA ( -CRE ) -CAT = ] G & S < 3 © ca 3 2 2 aA 2 6 V+IMXW V+EMMHN FIGURE 8 .

B , ELA cells were transfected with PCNA-CAT ( 5 ug ) together with the indicated ki-nase/reagents , and the CAT activities were determined .
C , EL4 cells were transfected with ZCRE-PCNA-CAT ( 5 ug ) and the indicated kinase , and the CAT activities were determined .
CD28-mediated CREB activation needs to be elucidated .
Efforts are currently devoted to dissect these events .
CaMKIV is supposed to be an exception to the above multisig-nal scenario for CREB activation .
CaMKIV alone not only phosphorylates CREB , but also activates CBP ( 61 , 66 ) , suggesting that CaMKIV alone should be sufficient to phosphorylate CREB and to promote CREB-CBP binding .
This is in contrast to our observations that CD3/CD28 activated CaMKIV ( Fig .
44 ) , yet the CD3/ CD28-induced CREB-CBP interaction still required signaling from both ERK and p38 ( Fig .
2 ) .
We speculate that there are two possible causes for this seeming discrepancy .
First , the CaMKIV CD3/CD28-INDUCED CREB-CBP INTERACTION activated by CD3/CD28 may not reach a threshold for full phosphorylation of CREB and activation of CBP .
It has been shown that a low concentration of glutamate induces CREB phosphorylation in neurons , but CREB frans-activation occurs only when CBP is also activated by a high concentration of glutamate ( 65 ) .
Under such circumstances , activation signals from the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are required for sufficient phosphorylation of CREB and formation of an active transcription complex .
Second , kinases such as CaMKIV are regulated by tightly associated phos-phatases , such that inactivation of CaMKIV occurs in the presence of sustained increases in Ca** '' ( 67 ) .
Signals from ERK or p38 MAPK may help maintain the activation level of CaMKIV through antagonism of the specific phosphatases .
Similar reasons may explain why ERK or p38 cascade alone is insufficient to activate CREB in T cells stimulated through CD3/CD28 , even though a weak CREB-CBP binding ( 2- to 3-fold ) was detected when MKK1 or MKK3 was overexpressed ( Figs .
6 and 7 ) .
Both CBP binding and activation of CREB by CD3/CD28 costimulation were insensitive to LY 294002 and wortmannin , inhibitors of PI 3-kinase .
In addition , PI 3-kinase , by itself or in combination with MKK1/A23187 , did not contribute to CREB-CBP binding ( Fig .
7 ) .
Even though PI 3-kinase is activated by CD28 ligation ( 33 , 34 ) , and PI 3-kinase activates Akt , which has been shown to phosphorylate CREB ( 21 ) , our results suggest that CD3/CD28 costimulation of CREB is mediated by a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway .
Similarly , JNK , another kinase activated by CD3/CD28 costimulation , was not able to stimulate CREB-CBP interaction ( Fig .
7 ) .
These results clearly illustrate that not all CD28-activated signals are involved in CREB frans-activation .
We have also found , probably for the first time , that CD28 engagement alone stimulates CaMKIV and p38 MAPK in T cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
CD28 costimulatory signal has been defined mostly for its convergence with TCR signals , for example , on the activation of JNK and IB kinase ( 41 , 43 ) .
Few activation events stimulated by CD28 ligation in the absence of CD3 engagement have been reported ( 68 , 69 ) .
Together with the activation of PI 3-K ( 35 ) , the present study supports the idea that CD28 engagement independently activates selective kinase pathways in T cells .
Our results thus suggest that CD28 contributes to CREB activation in a quantitative manner rather than in a qualitative manner .
CD3 alone stimulates ERK , p38 MAPK , and CaMKIV , but CD3 alone does not promote CREB-CBP binding ( Fig .
4 ) .
The signals activated by CD28 costimulation that lead to CREB-CBP interaction are p38 MAPK and CaMKIV , kinases that are also activated by CD3 .
Therefore , CD28 costimulation acts by synergistic enhancement of activation signals from CD3 .
In such a model , signals from CD3 engagement alone do not reach a threshold sufficient to activate transcription factor such as CREB .
Only through the augmentation from CD28 costimulation are T cell activation signals sufficient to trigger CREB-CBP binding .
We are in the progress of determining whether other T cell activation events induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation may be mediated by a mechanism similar to the one that activates CREB .
