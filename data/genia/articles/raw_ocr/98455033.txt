Received 26 September 1997 Revised version accepted for publication 10 March 1998 J Med Genet 1998 ; 35:852-856 Seminoma in a postmenopausal woman with a Y ; 15 translocation in peripheral blood lymphocytes and a t ( Y¥ ; 15 ) /45 , X Turner mosaic pattern in skin fibroblasts Nobuhiko Hoshi , Miri Fujita , Masato Mikuni , Takafumi Fujino , Kazuhiko Okuyama , Yasushi Handa , Hideto Yamada , Tadashi Sagawa , Hitoshi Hareyama , Yutaka Nakahori , Kenji Fujieda , Jeffrey A Kant , Kazuo Nagashima , Seiichiro Fujimoto Abstract We report an unusual case of a 55 year old Japanese woman with a seminoma but relatively normal menses .
The patient was a phenotypic female with late onset menarche ( 18 years of age ) , who was amenor-rhoeic for the first year , followed by menses of one to three days ' slight flow with dysmenorrhoea , but an otherwise normal menstrual history .
A typical seminoma was removed from the left adnexal region and an immature testis was identified separately as an associated right adnexal mass .
Repeated karyotypic studies on peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures showed only 46 , X , -Y , t ( Y ; 15 ) ( q12 ; p13 ) .
Cytogenetic examination of the patient 's younger brother , who had fathered three healthy children , showed an identical karyotype .
Mosaicism of 46 , X , -Y , t ( Y ; 15 ) ( q12 ; p13 ) /45 , X cell lines was found in skin samples from the patient 's elbow and genital regions , although there were no clinical stigmata of Turner syndrome .
An androgen receptor binding assay of cultured genital skin fibroblasts was negative .
Molecular analysis using Southern blot hybridisation , PCR , and direct DNA sequencing showed that neither the patient nor her brother had a detectable deletion or other abnormalities of Y chromosome sequences , including the SRY ( sex determining region of the Y chromosome ) gene sequence .
These findings suggest that Turner mosaicism of the 45 , X cell line may have contributed to this atypical presentation in an XY female , although o 8 # P M -- 0 A H 6 46 5 foﬂ K No children Figure 1 - Pedigree indicating child bearing history of family .

we can not exclude abnormalities of other genes related to sex differentiation .
( J Med Genet 1998 ; 35:852-856 ) Keywords : sex determining region of Y ( SRY ) ; seminoma ; Turner mosaicism Sexual dimorphism in mammalian embryogenesis provides a model of a developmental switch .
The signal event in development of a bipotential gonad into a testis ' is regulated in early embryogenesis by the Y chromosome . ''
' A regulatory gene named testis determining factor ( TDF ) has been mapped to the short arm of the Y chromosome ( interval 1¥1 ) ' by molecular genetic analysis of human sex reversal samples ( XX males and XY females ) . ''
* Full sexual differentiation and formation of a functional testis must involve programming by many different genes and not simply by the isolated testis determining sequence itself .
The gene SRY ( sex determining region of the Y chromosome ) ( in mice , Sry ) was isolated by analysis of 35 kb of DNA adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary in the human Y chromosome ' and is involved in sex differentiation . ''
SRY gene expression is presumably triggered via upstream genes to account for its specific time and place of expression . ''
Recently , Ad4BP/SF-1 , WT-1 ( Wilms tumour-1 ) , DAX ( dosage sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome ) , and SOX ( SRY type HMG box ) genes associated with sexual differentiation have been reported . ''
In addi-tion , other genes are presumably active in the formation of the urogenital ridges even before colonisation by primordial germ cells .
Materials and methods CASE REPORT A 55 year old married Japanese woman without children presented to her physician with vomiting , loss of appetite , and weight loss ( ~10 kg over two months ) .
The patient was 162 cm tall and weighed 48 kg ; physical examination was remarkable for a firm , non-tender mass in the pelvic cavity .
She had normal female external genitalia with moderate breast enlargement although pubic and axillary hair were slight .
Chest x ray and intravenous pyelogram were normal .

hyperplasia ( H & E ) .
Past history showed that the patient did not menstruate during the year following menarche at the age of 18 .
Thereafter , she had regular 28-30 day menstrual cycles of one to three days of slight flow with moderately severe dysmenorrhoea .
Her bleeding sometimes lasted for only one day and was scanty like staining .
Menses ceased at the age of 54 after five to six years of irregular cycles .
There was a family history of infertility in both men and women ( fig 1 ) .
Laboratory studies showed normal levels of AFP ( alphafetoprotein ) , CEA ( carcinoembry-onic antigen ) , CA ( carbohydrate antigen ) 19-9 , CA 125 , CA 50 , BFP ( basic fetoprotein ) , and hCG ( human chorionic gonadotrophin ) .
An 11 x 12 cm water dense mass impinging on the urinary bladder was noted by computed tomography ( fig 2A ) , along with enlargement of para-aortic lymph nodes ( fig 2B ) .
A laparotomy was performed .
The surgical specimen , submitted as a left ovarian tumour , measured 15 x 15 x 11 cm and weighed 750 g. The cut surface was solid with a soft elastiform consistency and uniform light brown colour .
A right adnexal mass , along with what was felt to be a rudimentary uterus and thin , short fallopian tubes , were also removed .
Microscopic examination of the tumour showed findings typical of a seminoma with cords of polyhedral cells featuring clear cytoplasm separated by a prominent lymphoid infiltrate ( fig 3A ) .
Immature seminiferous tubules indicating residual testis tissue were noted in part of the tumour ( fig 3B ) .
The right adnexal mass was also diagnosed as being of testicular origin because of immature seminiferous tubules containing only Sertoli cells , along with Leydig cell hyperplasia ( fig 3C ) in the intervening stroma .
Definitive uterine tissue could not be identified ; the tissue removed as a rudimentary uterus consisted only of smooth muscle tissue .
The patient subsequently underwent three courses of chemotherapy which included one course of PVB ( cisplatin 70 mg/m '' , vinblastine sulphate 3 mg/m ' , bleomycin 20 mg/m ' ) and two courses of CAP ( cisplatin 70 mg/m , adri-amycin 20 mg/m ' , cyclophosphamide 350 854 Table 1 - Chromosome analyses on blood , genital , and elbow skin from the patient and peripheral blood from her brother 46 , X , -¥,1 ( ¥ ; 15 ) Material ( q12 ; p13 ) 45 , X Blood 100 0 Genital skin 76 24 Elbow skin 90 10 Blood ( brother ) 50 0 mg/m '' ) followed by radiation therapy ( 40 Gray/16 frequency/4 week ) and is now felt to be in clinical remission without evidence of metastasis .
CYTOGENETIC AND MOLECULAR GENETIC EXAMINATION Multiple chromosome analyses were conducted on peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured fibroblasts from genital and elbow skin .
The patient 's father was dead , but we examined her younger brother 's karyotype by routine C , G , and Q banding methods for clues 22 Figure 4 - Karyotypes of the patient and her younger brother .

Genomic DNA was also prepared from peripheral blood leucocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts by standard tech-niques , and then subjected to restriction endo-nuclease digestion , electrophoresis , and Southern blot hybridisation using probes described below to detect the presence of various regions of the Y chromosome . ''
Two additional loci , the SRY and the proximal border of the pseudoautosomal region ( PABY ) , were examined by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) '' from DNA and from paraffin embedded gonadal tissues by a modified method . ''
For Southern blot studies , we used 17 Y specific fragments as probes .
These detected 24 loci spanning the entire chromosome from Yp to Yq telomeric regions ; the map positions of these loci have been previously defined by deletion mapping . ''
The Y chromosome sequence described by Sinclair et al ' was also used as a target for PCR .
Direct sequencing of the SRY region was performed using an ABI 373A fluorescent automated DNA sequencer ( Applied Biosys-tems , USA ) with Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit ( Perkin-Elmer Corporation , USA ) using custom primers from Hokkaido System Science Co Ltd , Japan .
Additional sequencing was also performed using a Hitachi SQ-5500 fluorescent automated DNA sequencer ( Hitachi Ltd , Japan ) using primers with 5° T7 sequences following subcloning of the ~350 bp PCR product using the Takara Ligation System ( Takara Shuzo Co Ltd , Japan ) , pT7 Blue T-vector ( Novagen , USA ) , and competent high DHS ( Toyobo , Japan ) cells .
Thermoseque-nase sequencing reagents were from Amersham International plc , UK .
ANDROGEN RECEPTOR STUDIES A genital skin sample was obtained by punch biopsy of the labia majora and cultured in 10 % FCS-MEM with Eagle 's salts supplemented with non-essential amino acids and antibiotics .
Specific binding of S5a-dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) to androgen receptors of skin fibroblasts was measured by the method described by Brown and Imagine . ''
Briefly , 10° confluent cells were incubated for one hour at 37°C with 0.15-5 nmol/l [ HJDHT dissolved in MEM without fetal bovine serum .
After incubation , the medium was removed and an aliquot was counted to determine free radioactivity .
The radioactivity remaining in the supernatant was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry , with a counting efficiency of 46 % for tritium .
Each 0.25 ml aliquot of the supernatant contained approximately 10-15 ug DNA , as determined by the method of Burton . ''
The maximum binding capacity ( Bmax , fmol/mg DNA ) and the apparent dissociation constants ( Kd , 10° mol/l ) of the DHT receptor were derived from Scatchard plots '' using linear regression analysis .
Results Repeated chromosome studies of the patient 's peripheral - blood showed a - 46 , X , -Y , t ( ¥ ; 15 ) ( q12 ; p13 ) translocation .

A confirmatory cytogenetic examination of the patient 's younger brother , who was married and had normal children , showed the same karyotype as the patient ( fig 4 ) .
Karyotypic analysis of the cultured fibroblasts from the patient 's genital and elbow skin showed a minor mosaic component with a 45 , X karyotype .
Ratios of 45 , X to 46 , X , -Y , t ( ¥ ; 15 ) ( q12 ; p13 ) cells in genital and elbow skin were 24/76 and 10/90 ( table 1 ) , suggesting the possibility of heterogeneity in other body organs .
Molecular probing of regions along the Y chromosome by Southern blotting , PCR , and direct sequencing approaches showed no apparent deletion of Y chromosome sequences in the patient or her brother and no mutation in the SRY gene in blood , tumour/gonadal tissue , or skin samples ( table 2 ) .
Androgen receptor binding assay in cultured genital skin showed no appreciable binding in five different experiments ( table 3 ) .
Discussion The present case appears to be an XY female , in agreement with histological evidence of tes- 855 tis tissue found in both adnexae as well as the diagnosis of her tumour as a seminoma .
Testicular feminisation ( androgen insensitivity syndrome ) was confirmed by the androgen receptor assays on cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient .
It is well known that XY females with seminoma have male genitalia owing to testosterone and do not have ovaries or a uterus , implying suppression of Miullerian duct development as a result of Milillerian inhibiting substance secreted by the fetal testis ( Sertoli cell ) . ''
However , unlike most XY females who present with primary amenorrhoea , our patient had a menstrual history of reasonably normal , if late onset , amenorrhoea for the first year , followed by menses of one to three days ' slight flow with dysmenorrhoea .
DNA analysis showed no evidence of deletion of Y chromosome sequences including the SRY region in either the patient or her brother as a possible explanation for this patient 's unusual menstrual history .
Many XY females have also been reported to have no abnormality in the SRY gene . ''
* The presence of Leydig and Sertoli cells also provides evidence for cells dependent on the expression of Y chromosome or SRY genes . ''
We performed chromosomal analysis of the patient 's genital and elbow skin to seek possible additional clues for this unusual phenotypic association .
These studies showed a minor but significant mosaic population of cells with a 45 , X karyotype intermixed among the majority with the constitutional 46 , X , -Y , t ( ¥ ; 15 ) ( q12 ; p13 ) karyotype .
Mosaicism associated with the 45 , X karyotype appears to have occurred after fertilisation because of differing results among different samples , and mosaic patterns are known to depend on many factors , such as the number of blastomeres at the time of the mutational event , the cell lineage affected by the mutational event , and cell viability and selection . ''
We do not know if mosaicism is present in other non-ectoderm derived tissues in the present case , but it was not observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes .
Unfortunately , no testis specimen was available for chromosome analysis .
The dysgenesis that characteristically produces 45 , X Turner syndrome '' is a common and interesting disorder .
Characteristic clinical features include short stature and primary amenorrhoea , neither of which our patient exhibited .
Although 45 , X is the most common karyotype , this syndrome may also be caused by the partial absence of one of the X chromo-somes , such as in 45 , X/46 , XY mosaicism . ''
* Turner mosaicism in gonadal and other genital tract tissues may in some modifying way have contributed to the unusual phenotypic features in our patient , although we can not exclude abnormalities in other sex differentiation related genes .
There is a possibility that her menses were caused by peripheral aromatase activity or hypophysis-adrenal gland hormone in the absence of ovulation not under the control of ovarian hormone .
The patient 's constitutional t ( Y ; 15 ) is probably a balanced translocation derived from her 856 father which is also present in her brother without effect .
