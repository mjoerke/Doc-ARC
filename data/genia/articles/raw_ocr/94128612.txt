Abstract Stimulation of primary human T-lymphocytes via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules induces a long-lasting proliferation ( > 3 weeks ) .
This potent activation does not require accessory cells , such as monocytes , but depends on persistent interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) secretion and receptivity , which is associated with high and prolonged expression of the inducible CD25/IL-2 receptor a ( IL-2Ra ) chain gene .
The transcription factor NF-KB participates in the regulation of both IL-2 and /L-2Ra genes , as well as multiple cellular genes involved in T-cell proliferation .
To evaluate the role of NF- « B in human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes , we previously analyzed the activation of NF- « B-related complexes in response to CD2+CD28 costimulation .
We demonstrated a long-term induction of p50/p65 heterodimer , a putative p65/c-Rel heterodimer , and a constitutive nuclear expression of KBF1/p50 homodimers .
As the role of p50 remains unclear , we focused our present study on NF- « B1 ( p50/p105 ) gene regulation .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western and Northern blot analyses , we studied NF- « B1 gene expression during T-cell stimulation via CD2+CD28 .
We observed a transient 4- to 5-fold increase of NF- « BI1 gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels , lasting for at least 24 h. p50 DNA-binding activity apparently stays highly controlled when p105 expression is enhanced by a physiological stimulus of peripheral blood T-cells .
Partial inhibition of p50 and p105 expression by NF-B1 antisense oligonucleotides significantly reduced T-cell proliferation and CD25/IL-2Ra cell surface expression .
These data provide direct evidence for a role of NF- « BI1 gene positive regulation during CD2+CD28 stimulation of primary human T-cells .

Introduction In vitro , T-lymphocyte activation requires two signals provided by different combinations of stimuli such as lectins , phorbol !
esters , cytokines , or mAbs .
Two main activation pathways have been described : the antigen-dependent pathway , involving the CD3/TcR complex , and the alternate pathway , engaging adhesion molecules such as CD2 and CD28 .
CD2 is present on nearly all T-lymphocytes .
CD28 is present on only half of the CD8-positive T-cells , but on almost all of the CD4-positive cells ( 1 ) .
These molecules have several functional ligands in vivo , i.e. , B7/BB1 for CD28 ( 2 , 3 ) , and LFA-3/COS58 ( 4-6 ) , CD59 ( 7 ) , and CD48 ( 8 ) for CD2 .
Costimulation of CD2 and CD28 is an excellent model for in vitro study of antigen-independent T-lymphocyte activation .
Their simultaneous activation leads to a long-lasting proliferation ( > 3 weeks versus 10 days for CD3/TcR-mediated activation ) of highly purified human T-lymphocytes ( 9 ) , which depends on their IL-2 secretion via a paracrine/autocrine pathway ( 10-12 ) .
This long-term IL-2 receptivity is supported by a persistent high-level expression of at least both IL-2 receptor a and B chains ( 9 , 13-15 ) .
T-cell stimulation leads to activation of the transcription factor NF- « B .
NF- « B participates in the regulation of multiple genes involved in immune , acute phase , and inflammatory responses , including the genes encoding for IL-2Ra , IL-2 , and other lymphokines ( for a review , see Ref .
16 ) .
In resting T-cells , the NF-kB complex , composed of 50- and 65-kDa subunits , is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive precursor complexed with an inhibitory protein , IB ( 17 , 18 ) .
Nuclear translocation of the active form of NF- « B ( 19 ) is posttranslationally induced by various stimuli including CD2 and CD28 .
Both subunits of NF- « B , p50 and p65 , bind to DNA ( 20 ) .
p50 is most probably the NH -terminal half of a larger protein , p105 , proteolytically processed to its functional size ( 21-24 ) .
This can be mimicked by the human immunodeficiency virus 1 protease during acute infection ( 23 ) .
In addition to its precursor role , p105 possesses an IkB-like activity ( 25 , 26 ) .
NF- « BI gene is a member of a transcription factor gene family , including the two NF- « B subunits p50 and p65 , c-Rel , p49/p100 , and I-Rel ( for re-views , see Refs .
27 and 28 ) .
Distinct combinations of NF- « B subunits can determine the specificity of transcriptional activation through modulation of binding to the various B motifs ( 27 , 29-31 ) .

Role of NF- « B1 Gene in CD2+CD28 Activation elements , only a few studies have attempted to assess its physiological role in human peripheral blood T-cells ( 32-36 ) .
Indeed , the role of NF- « B in T-lymphocytes was mainly studied in the tumor model and in T-cell clones which exhibit biological characteristics such as cytokine secretion and responses that are not manifested by primary T-lymphocytes ( 37-42 ) .
In an attempt to understand the physiological role of NF- « B , we recently reported that CD2+CD28 stimulation of purified human T-cells is associated with long-term persistence in the nucleus of two inducible NF- « B complexes and of constitutive KBF1/p50 homodimers ( 43 ) .
The inhibition of NF- « B nuclear activation by the free radical scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was associated with inhibition of T-cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion .
These data suggested that , in addition to its well-known involvement in the immediate response to external stimuli ( for a review , see Ref .
16 ) , NF- « B could play a role in the maintenance of T-cell activation via CD2 and CD28 .
The emerging multifunctional role of p50 and its precursor p105 ( 26 , 44 ) prompted us to focus the present study on NF- « B1 gene regulation during activation of primary human T-cells through the adhesion molecule pathway .
Results NF- « B1 ( p50/p105 ) mRNA Steady-State Level Is Increased upon CD2+CD28 Costimulation .
Northern blot analyses were performed to follow the steady-state level variation of the mRNA encoding NF- « B p50/p105 during T-cell activation by anti-CD2 , -CD28 , and -CD2+€CD28 .
A low steady-state level of the transcript was detected in peripheral unstimulated T-cells , as illustrated for mRNA samples at 6 h in Fig .
1A .
This low constitutive expression was not strongly affected by either the CD2 or CD28 stimulation alone , through a 96-h activation period ( Fig .
1 B ) .
In contrast , T-cell stimulation by CD2+CD28 resulted in a rapid and transient rise in the level of the 4-kb NF- « B1 mRNA that peaked at 6 h and was at least a 6-fold increase .
It returned slowly to the baseline level within 72 h after stimulation ( Fig .
1B ) .
However , this increase is not specific for CD2+CD28 costimu-lation , since we observed a comparable increase when using coated anti-CD3 mAb ( data not shown ) .
In the same RNA samples , a 2.6-kb mRNA encoding RelA ( p65 ) was detected that was not enhanced upon T-cell activation regardless of the stimulus ( data not shown ) .
NF- « B p50 and p105 Protein Increase in T-Lymphocytes Stimulated via CD2+CD28 .
To further characterize NF- « kBI gene expression during T-cell stimulation , p50 and p105 protein levels were measured in both cytosolic and nuclear extracts by Western blots using an antiserum for p50 .
As shown in Fig .
2A , NF- « B p50 was detected in cytosolic fractions of unstimulated T-cells as a major 55-kDa protein .
The level of cytosolic p50 protein was increased 2- to 4-fold after costimulation with anti-CD2 and -CD28 with reference to the unstimulated control ( compare Fig .
2A , Lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Furthermore , this inducible level was detectable as soon as 30 min after stimulation and remained elevated up to 96 h ( Fig .
2A , Lanes 3 to 6 ) .
After 1 and 2 weeks , p50 levels dropped to that of unstimulated cells .
The level of a 105-kDa species , which was very low in cytosolic extracts from unstimulated T-cells , was also increased upon stimulation .
Increased expression of p105 , the p50 precursor , was maintained for at least 24 h and progressively decreased to basal levels 1 week after stimulation .
In nuclear extracts , an increase of p50 protein was also observed ( Fig .
2B ) .

- Induction of NF- « B1 ( p50/p105 ) mRNA by CD2 +CD28 T-cell stimulation .
A , Northern blot analysis of NF- « B1 mRNA expression .
Purified T-lymphocytes were activated with CD2 , CD28 , and CD2 +CD28 mAbs , as described in `` Materials and Methods , '' and harvested at 6 h. Blots containing 20 pg/lane were hybridized simultaneously with NF- « B1 and HuBam cDNA probes .
HuBzam probe was used to control RNA loading and to quantify NF- « B1 hybridization signal .
8 , mRNA time course in CD2- or CD2+CD28-activated T-lymphocytes .
T-cells were activated with the different mAbs for the indicated times , and the 4-kb NF- « B1 ( p50/p105 ) mRNA level was analyzed and quantified as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Data represent the mean values of at least two experiments with different donors .
Values determined for CD28-activated T-cells were consistently similar to those obtained for CD2-activated cells and are not shown .
peaked 24 h after CD2+CD28 stimulation .
Consistent with previous findings , no p105 was detected in nuclear extracts ( 45 ) .
Moreover , levels of nuclear p50 returned more rapidly than cytoplasmic p50 to basal levels .
Surprisingly enough , p50 levels at 96 h and after were reproducibly observed below those of unstimulated controls , as emphasized in the representative experiment shown in Fig .
2B .
The delayed decrease of nuclear p50 contrasted with our previous observation of stable NF-kB and KBF1 complexes in CD2+CD28-stimulated T-cells as detected by EMSA ( 43 ) and UV-crosslinking ( data not shown ) .
As illustrated by comparison of panels A and B in Fig .
2 , T-cell cytoplasm contained apparently more p50 protein than nucleus , since 8 pg of nuclear fraction are usually required to provide a comparable signal to 2 pg of cytosol when detected by ECL-Western blotting .
By loading equal amounts of both fractions and surface area quantification , we confirmed that cytosol contained apparently 5 times more p50 protein than did the nuclear fraction ( data not shown ) .

- Cytoplasmic and nuclear detection of p50 and p105 proteins by Western blotting during long-term CD2 +€D28 costimulation .
Cytosolic and nuclear extracts from unstimulated or CD2+CD28-stimulated T-cells were separated on a polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions , transferred on to an Immobilon-P membrane , and incubated with an anti-p5ON serum .
Fixation of specific antibodies was detected using a commercial chemilu-minescent kit ( ECL ; Amersham } , as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''

Under our electrophoresis conditions , endogenous T-lymphocyte p50 migrated as a 55-kDa polypeptide when detected by Western blotting .

CD2+CD28 Stimulation Increases the Cytoplasmic Level of NF- « B DNA-binding Complexes .
Since we previously observed a stable level of « B-specific DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts of CD2+CD28-activated T-cells ( 43 ) and an apparent excess of immunodetected cytoplasmic p50 , we tried to determine whether the cytosolic p50 protein was an active DNA-binding form .
EMSA assays were performed to quantify « B-specific DNA-binding activities in cytosolic fractions prepared from purified T-cells before and after CD2 and CD28 costimulation .
As shown in Fig .
3 , we detected two major cytoplasmic DNA-binding complexes using a 5 end-labeled B , , . > ; ; , , oligonucleotide probe .
The faster migrating complex was nonspecific , since , as previously described under our experimental conditions ( 43 ) , it was equally competed by specific and nonspecific competitors ( data not shown ) .
The upper band was constitutively detected in cytosol , and its amount weakly increased upon CD2+CD28 costimulation .
Antiserum ( no .
3 ) , which specifically recognizes KBF1/p50 homodimers , had no effect on the upper band .
In contrast , antiserum no .

Consequently , the inducible « B-specific DNA-binding activity present in cytosol of unstimulated and CD2+CD28-stimulated T-cells was most likely the NF- « B p50/p65 heterodimer .
In accordance with previous studies , we failed to detect any KBF1/ p50 homodimers in T-lymphocyte cytosolic extracts .
In contrast , we have previously reported ( 43 ) that resting and stimulated T-cell nuclear extracts both contained relatively high but stable levels of KBF1/p50 homodimers .
Together , these data show that increased expression of NF- « BI gene does not lead to a parallel formation of more active KBF1/ p50 homodimers in either cytosolic or nuclear extracts .
NF- « B1 Gene Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide Inhibits p50 and p105 Protein Increase and T-Cell Proliferation .
To assess the role of NF- « kB1 gene in CD2+CD28 stimulation , purified human T-cells were treated with increasing amounts of sense and antisense oligonucleotides before and after CD2+CD28 stimulation .
As shown in Fig .
4A , NF- « B1 antisense oligonucleotide ( 22.5 um concentration ) reduced the amount of p50 polypeptide detected 24 h poststimulation by 36 % relative to cells stimulated in the presence of NF- « BI1 sense oligonucleotide .
Similarly , p105 protein level was reduced by 63 % .
RelA ( p65 ) sense and antisense oligonucleotides did not affect p50 and p105 protein levels ( data not shown ) .

As shown in Fig .
4B , increasing amounts of human Re/lA ( p65 ) sense and antisense oligonucleotides inhibited cell proliferation similarly ( 41 % and 45 % , respectively , at 22.5 um concentration ) .
However , the NF- « B1 antisense oligonucleotide reduced T-cell proliferation ( 89 % ) more efficiently than NF- « BI1 sense ( 63 % ) and both RelA ( p65 ) sense and antisense oligonucleotides ( P < 0.01 at 22.5 pm , paired ftest ) .
After NF- « BI1 antisense oligomer treatment at 22.5 pm , T-cell proliferation was reduced by 70 % relative to NF- « B1 sense control .
The same effects were observed in six independent experiments performed in duplicate using two different oligonucleotide preparations .
The absence of cell toxicity was controlled by trypan blue exclusion and microscopic observation ( cell viability greater than 90 % under all conditions ) .
We next studied the oligonucleotide effect on the expression of the proliferation-associated gene /L-2Ra , which is highly induced upon CD2 +CD28 stimulation ( 9 ) and whose promoter contains a well-characterized NF-kB DNA-binding site ( 47 ) .
Expression of CD25/IL-2Ra was examined at 72 h after addition of anti-CD2 and anti-CD28 mAbs ( Table 1 ) .
Exposure to NF- « B1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides reduced CD25/IL-2Ra expression by 41 % ( 27.5 % versus 46 % positive cells ) when compared to cells treated with NF- « B1 sense oligodeoxynucleotides at the same concentration ( 22.5 pim ) .
We conclude that T-cell treatment with NF- « B1 antisense unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited p50 and p105 protein overexpression and significantly reduced T-cell proliferation and CD25/IL-2Ra expression triggered by CD2+CD28 costimulation .
Discussion Recent studies have shown that NF- « B is a major transcription factor involved in cellular response to a large variety of stimuli ( 16 ) .
The role of NF- « B in T-lymphocytes was mainly studied in tumor models such as Jurkat , an acute lympho-cytic leukemia T-cell line ( for a review , see Ref .

Cell viability remained greater than 90 % under all conditions ( as determined by trypan blue exclusion ) .
mary cells , we are currently investigating the role of NF- « B in human peripheral T-lymphocytes activated via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules .
In agreement with the well-defined NF-KB activation mechanism in T-cells , we previously reported that long-term expression of the active nuclear form of NF- « B p50/p65 heterodimers is posttranslationally induced in response to activation by CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules ( 43 ) .
In the present study , we demonstrated in addition a transient increase of NF- « BI gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels .
Although gene induction required a CD2+CD28 combination , this increase was also observed with CD3/TcR antigen-dependent stimulation .
These data support positive transcriptional regulation of NF- « B1 gene in primary T-cells in addition to NF- « B activation by nuclear translocation ( 16 ) .

Our data are agreement with this hypothesis , but further experiments are required to confirm a role for an NF- « B1 autoregulatory loop in CD2+CD28 costimulation .
At first , only run-off assays can ultimately determine whether the increase in NF- « BI gene expression in primary T-lymphocytes results from a transient transcriptional event .
p50 is most probably a proteolytically truncated form of a 105-kDa precursor molecule ( p105 ) ( 21-24 ) .
The parallel increase of p50 and p105 observed by Western blotting supports an enhanced proteolysis of the precursor p105 after CD2+CD28 stimulation .
The induction of NF- « kB1 gene expression is only associated with a barely detectable increase of cytoplasmic p50/p65 DNA-binding activity .
p50 protein up-regulation is not associated with the appearance of KBF1/ p50 homodimers in cytosol , which has never been ob-served .
Finally , it does not increase the relatively high level of KBF1/p50 homodimer in the nucleus , as previously reported ( 43 ) .
In agreement with previous observations in different cell types ( 45 ) , we showed that in primary T-cells the p105 precursor is apparently confined to the cytoplasm , whereas processed p50 molecules are found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus .
Despite its overproduction , p105 is apparently not primarily used to sequester activated NF- « B , since bona fide NF- « B appears in the nucleus under the same stimulation conditions ( 43 ) .
Together , these data show that newly produced p50 is only in part included into p65-ikB complexes .
Since much more p50 was detected in cytosol than in nucleus , the remaining cytoplasmic p50 could be sequestered either by IxB or by p105 , both of which control p50 subcellular localization ( 26 , 44 , 50 , 51 ) .
Cotransfection assays in the Jurkat T-cell line have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of KBF1/p50 homodimers on the IL-2 promoter « B motif that correlated with down-modulation of constitutive KBF1 after T-cell stimulation ( 32 ) .
Consequently , an excess of KBF1 could be detrimental for T-cell growth through inhibition of a critical gene like IL-2 .
Inci-dentally , our present observation that the immunodetected nuclear p50 drops below the unstimulated control and the apparently stable maintenance of NF- « B and KBF1/p50 homodimers detected by EMSA ( 43 ) could be of physiological importance and indicative of a yet-to-be identified intra-nuclear level of regulation .
We propose that in normal T-lymphocytes only a fraction of p50 translocated to the nucleus after stimulation is active for DNA binding .
The remaining part could constitute a modulable pool of nuclear p50 which lacks DNA-binding activity .
Regardless of the exact mechanisms involved , the maintenance of p50 homodimer homeostasis appears to be of major importance in physiological T-cell activation .
Down-modulation of newly synthesized p50 and p105 is associated with a significant inhibition of T-cell proliferation and CD25/IL-2Ra : cell surface expression .
Antisense inhibition of p50 and p105 induction further confirms that new synthesis of p50 from processed p105 participates in a T-cell regulatory response triggered via CD2+CD28 .
Several possible sites of sequence-specific and -nonspecific action for oligodeoxynucleotides have been proposed to explain their inhibitory action along the information flow from DNA to protein in eukaryotic cells ( for a review , see Ref .
52 ) .
Using unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides that are degraded after a few hours ( see `` Materials and Methods '' ) , each individual level of action can gain more or less importance relative to the regulation of its target gene expression .
NF- « B1 and RelA ( p65 ) genes are differently regulated in primary T-cells .
It is therefore not surprising that we observed a difference between NF- « B1 and RelA ( p65 ) oligomer effects , and several explanations can be proposed .
In the absence of any significant difference between p65 sense and antisense oligonucleotides , we considered their action to be a nonspecific effect , perhaps due to association with a key enzyme for cell proliferation ( 52 ) .
In addition to the nonspecific effect observed for all tested oligomers at 22.5 um concentration , the antiproliferative action observed with NF- « B1 oligomer could be mediated through RNase H degradation of sequence-specific RNA/DNA duplexes created between oligonucleotides and mature mRNAs .
Alternatively , NF- « BI1 sense and antisense oligonucleotides may also act by hybridization to the locally opened loop created by RNA po-lymerase I1 and direct transcription inhibition by steric hin-drance .
Inhibition of CD25/IL-2Ra cell surface expression further confirmed the role of NF- « B in /L-2Ra gene up-regulation ( 53-56 ) .
As CD2+CD28-triggered T-cell proliferation is highly IL-2 dependent ( 10-12 ) , comparison between the almost complete antiproliferative effect and partial CD25/IL-2Ra inhibition further suggests the presence of additive nonspecific and specific effects .
Finally , the antisense approach allows us to discriminate between the contributions of preexisting and newly synthesized active NF- « B1 gene products in our T-cell model .
Variable effects have been observed with antisense NF- « B1 and RelA ( p65 ) oligonucleotide treatment which depend apparently on the cell model used .
Inhibition of NF- « B activation by both NF- « B1 and RelA ( p65 ) antisense oligonucleotides strongly impaired the growth of Tax-transformed fibroblastic tumors in vivo and of a human T-cell leukemia virus type l-transformed human B-lymphocyte line in vitro ( 57 ) .
Alternatively , antisense p65-treated ES and tumoral cell lines were growth inhibited in comparison to RelA ( p65 ) sense or both NF- « B1 sense and antisense oligonucleotides ( 58 ) .
In contrast , in CD2+CD28-activated primary T-cells , only antisense NF- « B1 oligonucleotides have a significant antiproliferative effect .
These discrepancies further emphasize the need to validate in primary cells the observations made with tumor cell lines .
They also confirm that the role and maintenance of NF- « B activity differ depending on cell type and activation .
In conclusion , we provide direct evidence that up-regulation of NF- « B1 gene plays a role in primary T-cell activation in vitro , suggesting a role for this induction in vivo as well .

Materials and Methods T-Cell Purification and Activation .
Peripheral blood T-cells were purified as previously described ( 59 ) .
Purity of T-cell preparations ( > 99 % ) was checked by immunofluorescence labeling with various mAbs specific for monocytic , B , and natural killer cells .
Contamination by monocytes was also controlled by the absence of T-cell proliferation upon optimal stimulation with phytohemagglutinin .
Stimulations were performed with the following mAbs , used alone or in combination , at saturating concentrations .
Anti-CD2 mAb 39C1.5 ( rat IgG2a ) and 6F 10.3 ( mouse IgG1 ) were used as purified mAbs at 10 pg/ml each ( 60 ) .
Anti-CD28 248 ascitic fluid ( mouse IgM ) , obtained from Dr. A. Moretta ( Cancer Institute , Genoa , Italy ) , was used at a 1/400 dilution .
Northern Blot Analysis .
Total RNA was prepared from cell pellets by lysis in guanidinium isothiocyanate and purified by centrifugation through a cushion of 5.7 m CsCl ( 61 ) .
Aliquots of 10 to 25 pg of total RNA were submitted to electrophoresis in agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon sheets ( Nytran ; Schleicher & Schuell ) .
Blots were pre-hybridized and hybridized as previously described ( 62 ) , with 1 x 10° cpm/ml of *°P-labeled DNA probes , which were radiolabeled by random priming ( 61 ) .
Probes used for Northern blot hybridizations included a 1.3-kb cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1 to 339 from human NF- « B1 in RcCMV vector ( the kind gift of Dr. Alain Israél , Institut Pas-teur , Paris , France ) , a 2.6-kb RelA ( p65 ) full-length cDNA in RcCMV vector ( 63 ) , and , as a control for relative amount of RNA loaded , a 0.6-kb fragment of HuBym cDNA in plasmid pBR322 ( 64 ) .
After hybridization , filters were washed at 42°C successively in 2x SSC-0.1 % SDS , down to 0.1 x SSC-0.1 % SDS .
They were autoradiographed on Kodak XAR-5 films ( Rochester , NY ) at -80°C using intensifying screens .
Semiquantitative analyses of autoradiograms were performed with an LKB Ultroscan laser densitometer , by using adequate exposures , and values were normalized to the signal of the HuB , m probe .
T-Cell Protein Extracts .
Cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared essentially according to the method of Schreiber et al .
( 65 ) , modified by Staal et al .
( 66 ) .
Briefly , cells were harvested and washed in cold Tris-buffered saline , then resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer A ( 10 mm Hepes , pH 7.8-10 mm KCI-2 m '' MgCl ; -1 mm dithiothreitol-0.1 mm EDTA , 0.1 mm phenylImethylsulfonyl !
fluoride ) supplemented with leupeptin ( 0.3 mg/ml ; Sigma ) , and incubated on ice for 15 min .
Then 25 pl of a 10 % Nonidet P-40 solution ( Sigma ) were added , and cells were mixed vigorously for 15 s and then centrifuged ( 13,000 rom , 15 s ) .
Supernatants corresponding to the cytosolic fraction were immediately complemented to 50 mm Hepes , 50 mm KCl , 300 mm NaCl , and 20 % glycerol , before storage at -80°C .
Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 pl of buffer C ( 50 mm Hepes , pH 7.8-50 mm KCI-300 mm NaCl-O0.1 mm EDTA-1 mm dithiothreitol-0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-10 % ( v/v ) glycerol ) .
After mixing for 20 min , the nuclei were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rom , and the supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were transferred to another tube and stored at -80°C .
Protein concentration was measured with a commercial kit ( Bio-Rad ) by the method of Bradford ( 67 ) .
Effects of antisense oligonucleotide on NF-kB p50 and p105 polypeptide expression level were controlled using whole cell extract directly prepared by suspension of T-cell pellets ( 10° cells ) in 50 pl of 8 m urea-0.5 m NH , HCO ; and immediately stored at -80°C .
SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis .
Cytoplasmic , nuclear , and whole cell extracts were boiled in reducing buffer for 3 min before loading onto a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
An equal amount of proteins was loaded per well , as indicated in the figure legends .
Following electrophoresis , the gels were transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane ( Millipore ) at 50 V for 18 h using a Trans-blot apparatus ( Bio-Rad ) .
Residual binding sites on the blotting membrane were blocked by incubation for 2 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 % nonfat dry milk .
After incubation with either rabbit anti-p50N serum ( 1/1000 difution ) or preimmune serum ( 1/1000 dilution ) , filters were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline-0.1 % Tween for 5 min at room temperature .
Then peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit serum from donkey preformed complex was added ( 1/1000 dilu-tion ) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing as described above , filters were reacted 1 min with che-miluminescent substrate luminol ( ECL kit ; Amersham ) and revealed by brief exposure ( 15 to 60 s ) using autoradiogra-phy films ( Kodak XAR-5 ) .
In all cases , equal protein load was controlled by Ponceau red counterstaining of the membrane and transfer efficiency by Coomassie blue staining of the gel after electrotransfer .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay .
Oligonucleotides were labeled using [ y- > 2P ] JATP and polynucleotide kinase , annealed , and gel purified for isolation of double-stranded probes .
Reactions with equal amounts of nuclear extracts ( 1 pg/reaction ) were performed in 20 ul final volume in buffer C containing 50,000 cpm probe , 0.25 pug poly-deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid , and 20 ug bovine serum albumin .
After incubation for 30 min at room temperature , binding reaction mixtures were loaded on a 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 % TBE ( 1 % TBE = 89 mm Tris-89 mm boric acid-1 mm EDTA ) .
After electrophoresis , dried gels were exposed at -80°C to Kodak XAR-5 film on intensifying screens ( Amersham ) .
For competition assays , unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides were gel purified after annealing .
Unlabeled competitor , specific antise-rum , or recombinant protein was added to reaction mixture just before adding the radiolabeled probe .
Oligodeoxynucleotide and Proliferation Assays .
Cells { 105/well ) were seeded in flat-bottomed microtiter plates in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 % fetal calf serum ( 200 pul/well ) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in the presence of various doses of oligonucleotides , as indicated in the figure legends .
Then CD2 and CD28 mAbs ( at the above mentioned concentrations ) were added or not , and the concentration of serum was raised to 10 % .
After 96 h culture , an MTT assay ( Sigma ) was used as an alternative to radioisotope incorporation to measure cell growth and to avoid any nonspecific inhibition due to the possible presence of free thy-midine from degraded oligonucleotides .
Briefly , cells were incubated with 20 pl of an MTT solution ( 5 mg/m ! )
for 4 h. Formazan crystals formed during incubation were then dissolved by addition of 0.1 n HCI in an amount equal to the culture volume , and the absorbance was spectrophotometri-cally measured at a wavelength of 570 nm .
All assays were performed in duplicate .
As controlled by polyacrylamide get Cell Growth & Differentiation electrophoresis , undegraded radiolabeled otigonuctieotides were still detectable in both culture medium and cytosol at least after 4 h. Oligodeoxynucleotides .
Oligodeoxynucleotides _ were synthesized on a 380B DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosys-tems ) .
Volatile organic contaminants were removed by Speed-Vac lyophilization and three cycles of dilution in pure water .
The absence of incomplete oligomers was checked by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the IL-2Ra promoter NF- « B-binding site ( « Bi. > r , , under-lined ) ( 56 ) used in EMSA was : 5'- CAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCTT-3 ' 3 '' Single-strand oligodeoxynucleotides used in T-cell cultures were : Human NF- « B1 sense : 5-GGCTTCAGAATGGCAGAAGA-3 ' antisense : 5'-ATCTICTGCCATTCTGAAGCC-3 ' Human Re/A ( p65 ) sense : 5-CGGCCATGGACGAACTGTTC-3 ' antisense : 5'-GAACAGTTCGTCCATGGCCG-3 ' These inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides extending over the translational initiation sites ( underlined ) were designed according to Kitajima et al .
( 57 ) but adapted to human gene sequences and without phosphorothioate modification .
Flow Cytometry .
CD25/IL-2Ra cell surface expression was detected according to standard procedures with fluo-rescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody 33B3.1 ( 68 ) using a FACSCAN ( Becton Dickinson ) .
