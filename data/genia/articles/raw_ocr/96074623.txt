STEINMAN®* *Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology , The Rockefeller University , New York , NY 10021 ; and *Department of Zoology , Kyoto University , Kyoto 606-01 , Japan Communicated by David J. L. Luck , The Rockefeller University , New York , NY , August 3 , 1995 ABSTRACT Productive infection of T cells with human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) typically requires that the T cells be stimulated with antigens or mitogens .
This requirement has been attributed to the activation of the transcription factor which synergizes with the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 to drive the HIV-1 promoter .
Recently , we have found that vigorous replication of HIV-1 takes place in nonactivated memory T cells after syncytium formation with dendritic cells ( DCs ) .
These syncytia lack activated cells as determined by an absence of staining for Ki-67 cell cycle antigen .
The expression and activity of NF-xB and Sp1 were , therefore , analyzed in isolated T cells and DCs from humans and mice .
We have used immunolabeling , Western blot anal-ysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays .
T cells lack active but express Spl as expected .
DCs express high levels of all known NF-xB and Rel proteins , with activity residing primarily within RelB , p50 , and p65 .
However , DCs lack Sp1 , which may explain the failure of HIV-1 to replicate in purified DCs .
Coexpression of NF- « B and Spl occurs in the heterologous DC-T-cell syncytia that are induced by HIV-1 .
Therefore , HIV-1-induced cell fusion brings together factors that upregulate virus transcription .
Since DCs and memory T cells frequently traffic together in situ , these unusual heterologous syncytia could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic HIV-1 replication without ostensible immune stimulation .
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) replicates in cultured T cells that have been stimulated by antigens or mitogens ( 1-4 ) .
Stimulation activates NF- « B or Rel transcription factors ( 5 ) , which can then drive corresponding NF- « B sites in the HIV-1 promoter ( 6 ) .
The HIV-1 promoter also contains essential Spl sites ( 6 , 7 ) , but Sp1 factors are expressed constitutively in the nuclei of most cells ( 8 ) .
However , anti-genic activation of T cells may not be essential for HIV-1 replication in infected individuals .
For example , these individuals lose T-cell memory for antigens to which they are no longer being exposed ( 9 , 10 ) .
Recent data on the substantial rate of HIV-1 replication in vivo also suggests some stable chronic stimulus for virus replication ( 11 , 12 ) .
The need for T-cell activation for HIV-1 replication became of interest to us when we identified a system in which mixtures of dendritic cells ( DCs ) and small-sized T cells , carrying a memory phenotype , supported vigorous infections with HIV-1 ( 13 ) .
The T lym-phocytes did not show critical features of cell activation since there was an absence of the Ki-67 cell cycle antigen , surface interleukin 2 receptors , and HLA-DR antigens ( 13 , 14 ) .
When these mixtures of DCs and T cells were exposed to several different isolates of HIV-1 , the newly synthesized HIV-1 gag proteins and virions were confined to heterologous syncytia ( DCs + T cells ) that were induced by the virus ( 13 ) .

This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
10944 permissive syncytia were formed with all seven HIV-1 isolates that we tested , including those that were classified as nonsyn-cytium inducing in standard test cell lines .
We show herein that the formation of these DC-T-cell syncytia brings together NF- « B or Rel proteins via the DC with Spl via the nonactivated T cell .
The capacity of HIV-1 to induce heterologous syncytia may lead to chronic unremitting virus replication in the absence of standard stimuli .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies .
Antibodies to the NF- « B/Rel family and to Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; anti-Ki-67 ( MIB-1 ) was from AMAC ( Westbrook , ME ) ; anti-HIV-1 p24 ( 15 ) was provided by The AIDS Research and Reagent Program .
Cell Preparations .
Mononuclear cells were isolated by flotation on Ficoll/Hypaque and separated into cell subsets as described ( 16 ) .
Mixed leukocyte reactions were carried out with 1 x 10° responding T cells and 3 X 10° allogeneic DCs .
Skin cell emigrants were prepared as described ( 14 ) .
Mouse cells ( DCs , T cells , B cells , and thioglycollate-elicited macro-phages ) were prepared by standard methods .
Bone marrow DCs were grown with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor from progenitors as described ( 17 ) .
Infection of Cell Suspensions .
Mixtures of allogeneic blood DCs and T cells ( mixed leukocyte reaction ) or 1 X 10° viable skin cell emigrants were added to wells of a 96-well round-bottom well plate .
Live was added for 1.5 h at 37°C at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05-0.1 ( 13 ) .
The cells were then washed and cultured for 5-6 days .
Immunolabeling of Cells .
For immunocytochemistry , the slides were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody ( 0.3 ug/ml ) , and bound antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and diaminoben-zidine .
For immunofluorescence , cells were incubated with the primary antibody ( 0.3 ug/ml ) followed by fluorescein isothio-cyanate-coupled anti-mouse or Texas red-coupled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin .
Western Blot Analysis .
Western blot analysis was carried out by using 10 ug of cell lysates .
Primary antibody ( 0.1 ug/ml ) was added in 5 % ( vol/vol ) milk .
Proteins were visualized with ECL .
DNA-Protein Binding [ Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) ] Assay .
The EMSA was performed as described ( 18 ) .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows : SP1 , 5 ! -ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3 ' ; SP1 mutant , 5 ! -ATTCGATCGGTITTCGGGGCGAGC-3 ' ; NF-kB , 5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3 ' ; NF- « B mutant , 5-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGG-3 ' ( mutations are under-lined ) .
Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared by a Abbreviations : HIV , human immunodeficiency virus ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; DC , dendritic cell .

standard protocol ( 18 , 19 ) .
From 3 to 10 ug of proteins was used for each reaction .
In Vitro Transcription .
The template and the conditions of the assay were as described ( 20 ) .
The template carries the HIV-1 promoter sequences from positions -109 to -~8 followed by the adenoviruses major late initiator element from positions -7 to +9 and a 379-bp G-free cassette .
Nuclear extracts ( 25-75 ug ) were used in these reactions .
Recombinant Spl was from Promega .
RESULTS HIV-1 Replicates in Mixtures of DCs and T Cells in the Absence of Cell Proliferation .
It was first essential to extend the evidence that T-cell proliferation is not required for HIV-1 replication in mixtures of DCs and ostensible nonactivated T cells from skin .
Skin was chosen since in many respects it resembles the lining of the organs involved in sexual transmission of HIV-1 , and both DCs and T cells chronically traffic in cutaneous afferent lymphatics ( 21 ) .
HIV-1 was added to skin cell emigrants or antigen-stimulated blood cells .
Both cultures became infected , as monitored by the release of p24 antigen and reverse transcriptase into the culture medium ( 13 , 22 ) , but it was not necessary to add a stimulus to the skin cultures ( 13 ) .
HIV-1-infected syncytia from both blood and skin expressed p24 antigen ( Fig .
1 4 and C ) .
However , the nuclei of the skin syncytia lacked the Ki-67 antigen that is expressed in the nuclei of cycling cells ( 23 ) , whereas the nuclei of the blood cell syncytia were all Ki-67-positive ( compare Fig .
1 B with D ) .
In two experiments , 100 % of the nuclei ( 85 counted ) in skin syncytia lacked Ki-67 , whereas 94 % of the nuclei ( 57 counted ) in blood-cell syncytia expressed Ki-67 .
Therefore , standard T-cell activating stimuli , which are required for HIV-1 replication in isolated blood cells ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 22 ) , are unlikely to be needed for replication in these mixtures of DCs and memory T cells .
Expression of NF- « B and Spl Proteins in Leukocytes .
Given the essential role for NF- « B ( Rel family ) and Spt sites in ( the regulation of the HIV-1 promoter , we set out to study the expression of Rel and Sp1 factors in different subsets of Fig .

HIV-l-infected syncytia contain cycling cells from blood and noncycling cells from skin .
Mixtures of allogeneic blood DCs and T cells ( mixed leukocyte reactions ) or syngeneic DCs and T cells from skin were infected with HIV-1jmg .
Cytocentrifuged cells were prepared after 5 days of infection and immunoperoxidase-stained for p24 and Ki-67 .
Skin syncytia were stained for HIV p24 antigen ( 4 ) or Ki-67 cell cycle antigen ( B ) .
Blood mixed leukocyte reaction syncytia were stained for HIV p24 ( C ) or Ki-67 ( D ) .

All Rel family proteins were readily identified in the cytoplasm and nuclei of HLA-DR-positive DCs from human blood , but Sp1 was not detectable ( Fig .

Previously only Drosophila cells were known to lack Sp1 ( 24 ) .
Contrasting findings were made in T cells from human blood .
Cells stained weakly and primarily in the cytoplasm with antibodies to the Rel family members , but Sp1 was abundant in all T-cell nuclei ( Fig .

Both cytofluorography and immunocytochemistry for Rel and Sp1 gave the same results on mouse spleen DCs and T cells , as presented above for human blood , i.e. , high levels of Rel proteins and low levels of Sp1 in DCs and vice versa in T cells .
We used immunoblot analysis to detect these proteins in different cell subsets from mice ( Fig .

T and B cells from spleen and macrophages elicited into the peritoneal cavity had abundant Sp1 ( Fig .

Analysis of NF- « B/Rel and Sp1 Binding Activities in Blood Cells .
The activity of these transcriptional control proteins was then assessed with a consensus NF- « B oligonucleotide and EMSA applied to several subsets of leukocytes .
Data are shown for human blood leukocytes , but comparable findings were made with mouse cells ( data not shown ) .
The NF- « B activity was primarily localized to the nucleus vs. cytoplasm in every cell type .
In each case , the activity was ablated by a wild-type competing oligonucleotide but not by a mutated sequence ( Fig .
34 ) .
NF-KB activity was greatly enhanced by stimulation of T cells ( phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) and monocytes ( lipopolysaccharide ) , but B cells and DCs had readily detectable NF-KB activity in the A T Unst T Stim cyt NE cyt NE m m m m Comp : - kB kB - kB kB - kB kB - kB kB Mo Unst Mo Stim cyt NE cyt NE m m m m Comp : - kB kB - kB kB - kB kB - kB kB i dane B DC cyt NE cyt NE m m m m Comp : - kB kB - kB kB - kB kB - kB kB C T B DC cyt NE NE cyt NE NE cyt NE NE cyt NE Stim : -o - - e # # - - - -~ Comp : SP1 SP1 SP1 i Mo Unst Mo LPS cyt NE cyt NE m m m m - SP1SP1 - SP1SP1 - SP1SP1 - SP1 SP1 * witt than Comp : B a - 2 & s © o u Ab : - a E 6 8 § 0 - 2 € DC T Stim Fig .

The T cells were studied without ( unst ) or with ( stim ) stimulation with phytohemagglutinin ( 1 ug/ml ! )
and phorbol 12-myristate l3-acetate ( 5 ng/ml ) for 12 h. Monocytes were studied without or with stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( 100 pg/ml ) .

Expression of Rel and Spl proteins in mixtures of DCs and T cells from skin .
Explants of skin were cultured for 4 days and emigrate cells were cytocentrifuged and stained with immunoperoxidase for c-Rel , RelB , p65 , Spl , and major histocompatibility complex class II .
The large DCs are readily distinguished from the small T cells , some of which are indicated with arrows .
absence of experimental stimulation ( Fig .
34 ) .
The NF-KB binding activity detected in DCs was not inhibited when extracts of unstimulated T cells were added ( data not shown ) .
This indicates that the DC NF- « B binding activity is dominant over that of the T cell .
f Supershift assays were carried out to identify the active NF- « B factors in human blood DCs and stimulated T cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
In standard NF- « B EMSA assays , the p65 and p50 components of the heterodimer migrate as separate species .
Antibodies to p50 , p65 , and Rel-B produced a supershift of the corresponding NF- « B species from DCs , whereas strong supershifts in stimulated T cells were observed with anti-p50 and anti-p65 .
For Spl EMSA assays , activity was noted in unstimulated T cells and stimulated macrophages but was weak in B cells and not detectable in DCs ( Fig .
3C ) .
The lack of detectable binding of DC nuclear extracts to the Spl consensus sequence suggested that Sp2 and Sp3 ( 25 ) were also absent in these extracts .
Detection of NF-B/Rel and Spl Proteins in Skin Cells .
Next , we evaluated the expression of NF- « B/Re !
and Sp1 in populations of cells isolated from skin .
These contain DCs and T cells that form tight conjugates and are permissive to HIV-1 ( 13 ) .
For both mouse and human skin , the DCs are large and Rel B irregularly shaped , while the T cells are small and round .
The DCs are known to be major histocompatibility complex class II-bright and CD3-negative , while the T cells are class II negative and CD3-positive .
In cells from mouse and human skin , the large DCs showed strong nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling with antibodies to all the Rel family members ( c-Rel , RelB , and p65 , shown here , but also p50 and p52 , not shown ) , but no labeling with anti-Sp1 ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast , the T cells showed weak labeling with all anti-Rel antibodies except p65 , but strong nuclear labeling with anti-Sp1 .
Syncytia of HIV-l-Infected Skin Cells Coexpress NF- « B /Rel and Sp1 Transcription Factors .
The studies were then repeated on HIV-1-infected human skin cells .
These cultures contained numerous syncytia .
Prior work had shown that the syncytia are heterologous ( double labeling with the CD1a marker for DCs and the CD3 marker for T cells ) and are the major site of viral replication ( 13 ) .
Fig .
5 shows three typical syncytia that were double labeled for the Rel proteins ( visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody ) and Spl ( visualized by Texas red-conjugated antibody ) .
These syncytia show RelB , p50 , and p65 cytoplasmic and nuclear staining , p50 being the strongest .

nuclei in these syncytia , presumably those derived from the T cells .
The efficiency with which virus replicates in skin syncytia may be due to the colocalization of these requisite transcription control proteins for HIV-1 in the syncytia .
DC Nuclear Extracts Transactivate the HIV-1 Promoter .
We have looked at the ability of DC and T-cell nuclear extracts to activate the HIV-1 promoter .
Nuclear extracts from HeLa and stimulated T cells show transcriptional activity ( Fig .
6 ) .
However , DC nuclear extracts needed to be supplemented with Sp1 to drive transcription in vitro .
DISCUSSION Prior studies in cell lines have identified an important role for NF- « B and Sp1 proteins in the transcriptional control of the HIV-1 ( 6 , 26 , 27 ) .
In primary cells , both monocytes and T cells will support replication of HIV-1 , but the cells must be stimulated , presumably to activate NF- « B and thereby initiate HIV-1 transcription .
DCs contain high levels of all known Rel family members and express strong activity for NF- « B in DNA binding .
This may reflect stimulation with , for example , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor during DC de-velopment .
However , DCs lack Spl , whereas T cells and monocytes express Sp1 in an active form .
These findings were made with DCs from human blood and skin , as well as mouse spleen , bone marrow , and skin .
The absence of Sp1 could account for the fact that isolated DCs do not support a productive infection with HIV-1 ( 13 , 22 , 28 ) .
T cells from several sites , which also do not support productive HIV-1 infection unless stimulated , lack active Rel proteins but have abundant Spl .
When HIV-1 infects mixtures of DCs and T cells ( and possibly , when DCs conjugate to `` latently '' infected T cells and vice versa ) , expression of low levels of envelope proteins might mediate cell fusion via the CD4 molecule that can be expressed by either cell type .
As a result of the formation of these unusual heterologous syncytia , high levels of active Rel and Spl proteins are brought together into the same cell .
The HIV-1 promoter should then be stimulated strongly , leading to the marked production of virions even in the absence of standard stimuli .
DCs are present in the linings of all of the organs involved in the sexual transmission of HIV-1 , while DC-T-cell conjugates are found in the afferent lymphatics of all four mammalian species that have been studied including humans ( for review , see refs .
29-33 ) .
The capacity of HIV-1 to create heterologous syncytia between these two CD4* cell types can bring together requisite transcriptional control proteins for the viral promoter .
To our knowledge , this phenomenon of heterologous syncytia and mixing of transcriptional control proteins has not been seen previously in viral infection ( or other circumstances ) and may contribute to chronic HIV-1 replication in sifu .
