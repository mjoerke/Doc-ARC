4367-4371 , May 1994 Biochemistry Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts encoded by the murine p105 NF-B gene generates IB y isoforms with different inhibitory activities ( transcription factors/RNA splicing ) RAELENE J. GRUMONT AND STEVE GERONDAKIS* The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research , Post Office , The Royal Melbourne Hospital , Parkville , Victoria 3050 , Australia Communicated by G. J. V. Nossal , December 27 , 1993 ABSTRACT The gene encoding the 105-kDa protein ( p105 ) precursor of the p50 subunit of transcription factor NF-xB also encodes a p70 IxB protein , LB y , which is identical to the C-terminal 607 amino acids of p105 .
Here we show that alternative RNA splicing generates isoforms with properties different from those of p70 .
One 63-kDa isoform , termed IxBy-1 , which lacks 59 amino acids C-terminal to ankyrin repeat 7 , has a novel 35-amino acid C terminus encoded by an alternative reading frame of the p105 gene .
A 55-kDa isoform , IxBy-2 , lacks the 190 C-terminal amino acids of p70I « By .
In contrast to p70IxB y , which is a cytoplasmic protein , xB y-1 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus , whereas IxBy-2 is predominantly nuclear .
The IxB y isoforms also display differences in specificity and affinity for Rel /NF-B proteins .
While p70IxB y inhibits pS50- , p6S5- , and c-Rel-mediated transactivation and /or DNA binding , both IB y-1 and IB y-2 are specific for p50 and have different affinities for this subunit .
The absence in IxBy-1 and IxBy-2 of a protein kinase A site whose phosphorylation modulates p70IxBy inhibitory activity suggests that alternative RNA splicing may be used to generate IB y isoforms that respond differently to intracellular signals .
The ubiquitous transcription factor NF- « B is a member of a family of homo- and heterodimeric proteins comprising subunits related to the c-re/ protooncogene ( 1-4 ) .
NF- « B-like factors regulate transcription by binding to decameric sequences ( « B elements ) found within the promoters and enhancers of a wide variety of viral and cellular genes ( 1-4 ) .
Rel-related proteins ( c-Rel , v-Rel , p65 , p50/p105 , p49/p100 , RelB , and Dorsal ) share a common N-terminal domain of ~300 aa ( Rel homology domain ) that contains sequences important for DNA binding , protein dimerization , and nuclear localization ( 1-4 ) .
In contrast with other Rel family members , p49 and p50 are derived by proteolytic cleavage from the N terminus of the precursors p100 and p105 , respectively ( 5 ) .
The C termini of Rel-related proteins are completely divergent , with those of c-Rel , p65 , and RelB containing transcriptional transactivating domains ( 6-8 ) .
The C-terminal halves of p100 and p105 contain seven repeat structures , each of 35-40 aa , that are related to motifs found in erythrocyte ankyrin and proteins involved in differentiation and cell cycle control ( 4 , 5 ) .
While NF-KB is constitutively nuclear in mature B cells , in most cell types NF- « B-related proteins are found in the cytoplasm as part of a non-DNA-binding complex associated with regulatory proteins termed inhibitors ( IxBs ) .
Cytoplasmic NF-KB is mobilized by a wide range of extracellular signals which are thought to lead to the phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation of IxB from NF- « B , thereby allowing NF- « B to be translocated to the nucleus .

This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
4367 The molecular cloning of cDNAs for several IxB proteins revealed that all contain six or seven ankyrin-like repeats , which in the case of the IxB proteins pp40 and Bcl-3 have been shown to be essential for preventing NF- « B nuclear translocation and inhibiting DNA binding by Rel/NF- « B complexes ( 9 , 10 ) .
This property of IxB ankyrin-like repeats is consistent with the ability of the C termini of p105 and p100 to inhibit DNA binding by the precursors and retain these proteins in the cytoplasm ( 5 ) .
The murine p105 gene also encodes a discrete 70-kDa inhibitor , IxB y , which is identical to the C-terminal 607 amino acids of p105 ( 11 , 12 ) .
IxBy is expressed in a wide range of tissues ( 12 ) and can regulate the nuclear localization and DNA binding of p50 and c-Rel homodimers and pS50/p6S5 heterodimers ( 11 , 12 ) .
Here we show that alternative RNA splicing of the murine p105 gene generates IxBy isoforms that have unique IxB activities and display differential subcellular localization . ?

RESULTS Alternative RNA Splicing of the 4.0- and 2.6-kb mRNAs Encoded by the p105 NF-xB Gene Generates p50 Precursor and IxBy Isoforms with Different C Termini .
The 2.6-kb mRNA transcribed from the murine p105 NF- « B gene encodes a 70-kDa IxB ( IxB y ) protein identical to the C-terminal 607 aa of p105 ( 11 , 12 , 19 ) .
During the characterization of the 2.6-kb transcript , cDNA clones were isolated that contained deletions within the C-terminal coding region of p10S/ p70I « By .
To ascertain whether these deletions , which fall within and C-terminal to ankyrin repeat 7 , represent alternative RNA splicing , an [ a- > P ] JUTP-labeled RNA probe spanning this region was used for RNase protection analysis .
A survey of p105 gene expression in murine cell lines , shown in Fig .
1A , revealed smaller species in addition to the predicted fragment of 285 nt .
While a 190-nt fragment of varying abundance was present in pre-B , B , and erythroid cell lines , other minor bands were also present in cells such as the myeloid leukemia W3B .
This finding supports the notion that alternative splicing occurs within this region of the p105 gene .

Alternative RNA splicing within the murine p105 gene .
( A ) p105 gene expression in murine cell lines .
Ten-microgram samples of total cytoplasmic RNA hybridized to the 285-nt p105 and 150-nt rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) probes were digested with RNases A and Tl and then fractionated in acrylamide/urea gels .
RNA was isolated from the following cell lines : 38B9 , 70Z/3 , and PD31 ( pre-B-cell lymphomas ) ; W231 , W279 , 2PK3 , 1Bral , and 3Mes3 ( B-cell lymphomas ) ; MPC11 , $ 107 , and P3 ( plasmacytomas ) ; FN4 and J2E ( erythroid leukemias ) ; L cells and EMT 6 ( fibroblasts ) ; W3B ( myeloid leukemia ) ; and B16 ( melanoma ) .
This gel was exposed for 48 hr of autoradiography at -70°C .
The major 285-nt and minor 190-nt p105 RNase protection products are indicated .
As this probe would yield a product for transcripts corresponding to splice 1 , only 4 nt shorter than the 285-nt fragment , this product would not be identified here .
( B ) Sequence of cDNA clones containing alternative splices in the p105/p70 coding region .
The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of two cDNA clones ( splice 1 and splice 2 ) are compared with those of p70IxBy .
The amino acid numbering of p70I « By is as previously described ( 12 ) .
The broken line indicates the points at which the sequences of splices 1 and 2 diverge from that of p70I « By .
shift that leads to the generation of a protein lacking the C-terminal 190 aa of p105/p70I « By .
As both cDNA clones have incomplete 5 ' ends , PCR was used to determine whether these RNA splices were present in both the 4.0- and the 2.6-kb mRNAs .
The predicted sizes of PCR products representing alternatively spliced p50 precursor or IxB y transcripts were based on the use of 3 ' primers spanning the splice junctions of clones for splices 1 and 2 in conjunction with 5 ' primers specific for the 4.0- and 2.6-kb mRNAs ( 12 ) .
The results of these experiments , shown in Fig .
2 , indicate that the splices present in both cDNA clones are represented in the 4.0- and 2.6-kb mRNA populations encoding the p50 precursor and IxBy , respectively .
Cells shown by PCR to express transcripts for these putative proteins were metabolically labeled and lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for the p50 precursor and IxBy isoforms .
Immunoprecipitation of 38B9 lysates with 70-2 antibodies , raised against a 27-aa epitope common to all p50 precursor and IxBy isoforms , is shown in Fig .
3A .
In addition to p105 and p70I « By ( lane 5 ) , a number of other proteins were also detected .
Two proteins of 63 kDa ( p63 ) and 55 kDa ( p55 ) had mobilities equivalent to those of in vitro translation products of the Biochemistry : Grumont and Gerondakis p50 precursor IBY transcript transcript SPLICE 1 1746 bp .

Splices 1 and 2 are in both the 4.0- and 2.6-kb mRNA populations encoding the p50 precursors and IxB y , respectively .
The 4.0- and 2.6-kb transcripts containing splices 1 and 2 are expressed in cell lines representing various stages of B-cell differentiation .
One-microgram samples of total cytoplasmic RNA isolated from various B-cell lines were reverse transcribed and then subjected to PCR using 5° primers specific for the 4.0- and 2.6-kb transcripts in combination with 3 ' primers specific for splices 1 and 2 .
The sizes of PCR products fractionated in a 0.8 % agarose gel were compared with HindlIlI-cleaved A DNA and Hae III-cleaved $ X174 DNA ( lane 1 ) .
No-cDNA controls are shown in lanes 2 and 11 .
Lanes 3-10 show the PCR products for p50 precursor transcripts encoding splices 1 and 2 , while the PCR products for the I « B~y transcript isoforms are shown in lanes 12-19. cDNAs encoding the IxBy isoforms generated by splices 1 and 2 , respectively ( lanes 2 , 3 , and 5 ) .
While the identity of the other proteins , the immunoprecipitation of which was specifically blocked by preincubation with the 70-2 peptide ( lane 6 ) , remains to be determined , some appear to correspond to isoforms of the p50 precursor or represent copre-cipitation of the p50 and p49 subunits that associate with the p50 precursors ( S.G. , unpublished results ) .
Antibodies ( SP-1 ) directed to the unique 35-aa domain generated by splice 1 specifically precipitated 63-kDa ( p63 ) and 98-kDa ( p98 ) proteins ( Fig .
3B , lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) , of sizes consistent with those predicted for these p50 precursor and IxB y isoforms , respectively .
Furthermore , precipitation of these proteins was specifically blocked by preincubation of SP-1 antiserum with an excess of peptide ( lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) .
While proteins representing the splice 1 version of the p50 precursor and IxB y isoform were seen in the W231 and 129 B-lymphoid cell lines , only the p50 precursor isoform was seen in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts , a finding consistent with the inability to detect p70I « B y in these cells ( 11 ) .
Therefore , these immunoprecipitation studies together with the RNase protection and PCR analysis collectively confirm that the cDNA clones described here represent isoforms of the pSO precursor and IxB y that are expressed in a number of cell types .
IxBy Isoforms Differentially Modulate Rel/NF-B-Mediated Transcription and DNA Binding .
The remainder of this paper will focus on the activities of the IxB y isoforms ; the properties of the p50 precursor isoforms will be described elsewhere .

Detection of p50 precursor and I « B7y isoforms by immu-noprecipitation .
( A ) Immunoprecipitation of p50 precursor and IxBy isoforms with antibodies directed to a common epitope .
In vitro translation and immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled 38B9 cell extracts were performed as described in Methods .
Lanes 1-3 , in vitro translation products of cDNA clones encoding the IxBy isoforms p70 , splice 1 , and splice 2 , respectively ; lanes 4-6 , [ *SJme-thionine-labeled 38B9 extract incubated with preimmune serum ( lane 4 ) or with 70.2 antibodies in the absence ( lanes 5 ) or presence ( lane 6 ) of 70.2 peptide .
The gel was exposed for 24 hr of autoradiography .
p63 and p55 refer to proteins precipitated by 70.2 antibodies ( lane 5 ) that are of the same mobility as in vitro translation products for the IxBy isoforms generated by splice 1 ( lane 2 ) and splice 2 ( lane 3 ) , respectively .
( B ) Detection of p50 precursor and IxBy isoforms generated by splice 1 , using SP-1 antibodies , which are specific for the unique C-terminal epitope .
Metabolically labeled lysates from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts ( lanes 1-3 ) , 70273 pre-B cells ( lanes 4-6 ) , and W231 B cells ( lanes 7-9 ) were precipitated with preimmune serum ( lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ) or with SP-1 antibodies in the absence ( lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) or presence ( lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) of the corresponding peptide .
The gel was exposed for 4 days of autoradiography at -70°C .
The p50 precursor ( p98 ) and IxBy isoform ( p63 ) are indicated .
DNA binding of p50/p65 and c-Rel or p50 homodimers ( 11 , 12 , 19 ) .
To assess the inhibitory properties of the IxBy isoforms in vivo , expression vectors for p70I « By , IxBy1 , and IxBy2 were transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells together with vectors for Rel/NF- « B proteins and a « B-regulated reporter ( 15 ) .
Endogenous NF- « B activity in Jurkat cells , albeit weak , was reproducibly down-regulated by all IxBy isoforms ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1-7 ) .
The inability of p50 homodimers to transactivate NF- « B-regulated genes prevents a direct measurement of the ability of IxBy to modulate p50 activity in vivo .
Instead , a chimeric p50-p65 protein consisting of the p50 Rel homology domain fused to the C-terminal p65 transactivation domain ( 7 ) was used for these experiments .
Although all IxBy isoforms inhibited p50-p65-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
4 , lanes 8-14 ) , the various isoforms displayed a hierarchy of inhibitory activity .
At an equivalent concentration , p70IxBy suppressed p50-p65 transactivation more effectively than either IxBy1 or IxBy2 , while IxBy1 was more effective than I « By-2 .
In contrast to p70IxBy , which repressed both p65- and c-Rel-mediated transactivation ( ref .
12 ; Fig .
4 , lanes 15-17 and 22-24 , respectively ) , neither IxBy1 nor IxBy2 effectively inhibited p65 transactivation ( lanes 18-21 ) and both of these isoforms reduced c-Rel transactivation ( lanes 4370 Biochemistry : Grumont and Gerondakis Lanes % Acetylation FiG .

Collectively , these transactivation assays show that the IxBy1 and IxBy2 isoforms , in contrast to p70I « B y , specifically inhibit the activity of the p50 NF- « B subunit .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were used to determine the ability of IxBy1 and IxBy2 to inhibit DNA binding of Rel/NF- « B proteins .
IxBy1 and IxBy2 displayed inhibitory properties different from those of p70I « B y in these gel shift assays ( Fig .

While all IxBy isoforms inhibited p50 DNA binding , a gradation of inhibitory activity was ob-served , with p70I « xBy being more effective than equivalent amounts of IxBy-1 or IxBy-2 , and IxBy-1 having stronger I « xB activity for p50 homodimers than IxBy2 .
In contrast to p70I « By ( 11 , 12 ) , neither IxBy1 nor I « By-2 inhibited DNA binding by c-Rel .
Further , like p70I « By ( 12 ) , neither isoform 1 nor 2 inhibited p65 DNA binding in vitro .

Effect of I « By isoforms on DNA binding by Rel/NF- « B proteins .
One-microliter samples of p50 in vitro translation products or bacterially synthesized c-Rel ( aa 1-403 ) and p65 ( aa 1-317 ) proteins were preincubated in the absence ( lane 1 ) or presence of 20 or 100 ng of IxBy ( p70 ) ( lanes 2 and 3 ) , IxBy1 ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , or IxBy2 ( lanes 6 and 7 ) prior to addition of radiolabeled B3 ( p50 , c-Rel ; ref .
15 ) or « BE ( p65 ) probe .
COS cells transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding the three isoforms was performed .
The N terminus of each IxBy isoform was tagged with a 9-aa sequence from influenza hemagglutinin ( 17 ) , thereby enabling a monoclonal antibody that recognizes this epitope to be used for immunofluorescence analysis .
p70I « By was localized in the cytoplasm ( Fig .
6B ) , confirming previous findings ( 11 ) , but both I « By1 and IxBy-2 displayed a different pattern of staining .
IkxBy1 ( Fig .
6C ) showed staining of approximately equal intensity within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus , whereas staining of IxBy2-transfected cells appeared to be confined largely to the nucleus ( Fig .
6D ) .
This differential subcellular localization of the IxB y isoforms is not simply due to an effect of the N-terminal epitopic tag , as immunofluorescence analysis of cells transfected with expression vectors encoding the nontagged IxBy isoforms showed the same staining patterns ( R.J.G. , results not shown ) .

Biochemistry : Grumont and Gerondakis changes within the C terminus of IxBy proteins can alter the subcellular localization of these proteins .
DISCUSSION The IB proteins , which are encoded by a small multigene family , display different affinities and inhibitory properties for the various NF- « B complexes .
Here we demonstrate that alternative RNA splicing can diversify IB activity by generating IxB y isoforms that display unique inhibitory activities and function in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus .
This study demonstrates that RNA splicing is used as a mechanism to diversify the activity of IxB proteins .
The expression in a cell of multiple IxB~y isoforms that possess similar yet distinct properties could be envisaged as a means of fine tuning intracellular signaling through the NF-KB pathway .
For example , instead of a stimulus activating all NF- « B/IxB y complexes , only that subset of the cytoplasmic complexes in which the IxBy proteins are phosphorylated would be mobilized .
This could provide a cell with the flexibility to activate cytoplasmic NF- « B/IxB complexes through independent signal transduction pathways without the need to replenish the entire NF- « B pool through new protein synthesis .
This model is supported by the finding that a regulatory protein kinase A site located within the C terminus of p70I « By ( aa 573-576 ; ref .
12 ) is absent in both IxBy-1 and IxBy2 .
The finding that the IxBy isoforms described in this study exhibit distinct patterns of subcellular expression implies that these inhibitors function in different compartments of the cell .
While p70IxB y has been observed only in the cytoplasm ( 11 ) , both IxBy1 and IxBy2 are found in the nucleus and appear to display specific inhibitory activity for the p50 subunit of NF- « B .
This may indicate that these IxBy isoforms , in contrast to cytoplasmic p70I « B , are able to directly control the expression of genes regulated by p50 ho-modimers , a finding consistent with the ability of IxBy1 and I « xBy2 to remove p50 homodimers bound to DNA in vitro ( R.J.G. , unpublished results ) .
These properties are shared with Bcl-3 , a nuclear IxB protein that has also been shown to inhibit DNA binding of p50 homodimers ( 10 , 20 , 21 ) .
The basis for the differential subcellular localization of the IxB y isoforms remains to be determined .
p70IxB y appears to be expressed in the cytoplasm , IxBy1 is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus , and IxBy2 is predominantly nuclear .
Since IxBy2 does not contain a unique sequence that could potentially function as a nuclear localization signal , the most likely explanation for the nuclear localization of IxBy1 and IxBy-2 is that a cryptic nuclear targeting signal present in all IxBy proteins is masked in p70IkBy by sequences C-terminal to the ankyrin repeats .
Removal of C-terminal coding sequences by RNA splicing could result in conformational changes that would expose this site to the nuclear transport machinery .
The 40-kDa IxBa protein , pp40 , which is cytoplasmic in most cell types ( 22 , 23 ) , is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of certain B-cell lines ( 24 , 25 ) , a finding that supports a model for the regulated nuclear transport of IxB proteins .
While the ankyrin repeats are essential for IxB proteins to interact with and inhibit DNA binding by Rel/NF- « B complexes ( 4 , 5 , 9 ) , the transactivation and DNA-binding assays reported in this study establish that sequences C-terminal to the ankyrin repeats also determine the specificity and affinity of IxBy isoforms for different NF- « B subunits .
Unlike p70IxB+y , neither IxBy1 nor IxBy2 represses c-Rel or p65 transactivation to any significant extent or inhibits c-Rel DNA binding .
Although p70I « By represses p65 transactiva- Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 91 ( 1994 ) 4371 tion in vivo , the mechanism of p65 inhibition is unclear because p70I « B , unlike IxBa , does not inhibit p65 DNA binding in vitro ( 12 ) .
A hierarchy of inhibitory activity displayed by the various IxB y isoforms for p50 DNA binding indicates that sequences outside the ankyrin repeats influence the affinity of the IxBy-p50 interaction .
While it is not obvious what role IxB y proteins with a lower affinity for p50 homodimers would serve , one possibility may be that the nuclear IxBy isoforms , rather than removing p50 ho-modimers , which are thought to repress NF- « B-regulated gene expression ( 26 ) , could instead modulate but not completely inhibit the role of p50 homodimers in the regulated expression of certain genes .
