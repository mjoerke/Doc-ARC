Two Distinct Pathways of Interleukin-5 Synthesis in Allergen-Specific Human T-Cell Clones Are Suppressed by Glucocorticoids By Akio Mori , Osamu Kaminuma , Matsunobu Suko , Satoshi Inoue , Takeo Ohmura , Akihiko Hoshino , Yumiko Asakura , Keiji Miyazawa , Toyokazu Yokota , Yasushi Okumura , Koji Ito , and Hirokazu Okudaira Glucocorticoids ( GC ) have long been used as the most effective agents for the treatment of allergic diseases accompanied by eosinophilia such as chronic asthma and atopic dermatitis .
The development of chronic eosinophilic inflammation is dependent on interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) , a selective eosinophil-activating factor , produced by helper T cells .
To delineate the regulatory mechanisms of human IL-5 synthe-sis , we established allergen-specific CD4* T-cell clones from asthmatic patients .
GC efficiently suppressed IL-5 synthesis of T-cell clones activated via either T-cell receptor ( TCR ) or IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) .
Induction of IL-5 mRNA upon TCR and IL-2R stimulation was totally inhibited by dexamethasone .
Human IL-5 promoter/enhancer-luciferase gene construct transfected to T-cell clones was transcribed on either TCR NTERLEUKIN-5 ( IL-5 ) is a potent selective growth factor , differentiation factor , activating factor , and chemo-tactic factor for human eosinophils . ' ''
Several animal studies have shown that tissue infiltration of eosinophils is dependent on IL-5 produced by T cells .
* '' Persistent eosinophilic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa is a characteristic pathologic feature of bronchial asthma . ''
The number of CD4* T cells expressing IL-5 mRNA is increased in the bronchial mucosa of symptomatic asthmatics , '' is correlated with the number of activated eosinophils , and is further increased upon allergen inhalation challenge . ' '' ''
L-5 is the predominant eosinophil-active cytokine present in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluids obtained during allergen-induced late-phase reaction . ''
Oral prednisolone therapy reduced serum IL-5 concentration '' and the number of IL-5 mRNA-expressing cells in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid , `` * in parallel with clinical improvement .
Control of T-cell IL-5 production seems to be an effective strategy for the management of allergic diseases characterized by eosinophilic inflammation .
Glucocorticoids ( GC ) have long been considered the most effective treatment for eosinophilic disorders , including chronic asthma . ''
The efficacy of GC is ascribed to their multiple pharmacologic actions , one of which is the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production . '' ''
We and others reported that IL-5 synthesis by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was inhibited by GC in vitro .
'* '' '' Because of the mixed cell preparations used in those studies , the question of whether GC act directly on T cells or not still remains to be answered .
It is well known that GC induce non-T cells to produce anti-inflammatory mediators , eg , lipocortins , which exhibit immunosuppressive effects on T cells . ''
To address this issue , we used allergen-specific human T-cell clones in the present study and showed that GC directly act on T cells to suppress IL-5 synthesis at the level of gene transcription .
We have recently reported that human helper T-cell clones produce IL-5 in response to IL-2 as well as to antigenic stimulation . ''
Several investigators have reported that the production of not only Th2 cytokines but also IL-2 ( a Th1 cytokine ) by infiltrating T cells is enhanced at the sites of allergic inflammation . ''
Locally produced IL-2 may facilitate the development of eosinophilic inflammation through Blood , Vol 89 , No 8 ( April 15 ) , 1997 : pp 2891-2900 or IL-2R stimulation and was clearly downregulated by dexamethasone , indicating that the approximately 500-bp human IL-5 gene segment located 5 ' upstream of the coding region contains activation-inducible enhancer elements responsible for the regulation by GC .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis suggested that AP-1 and NF- « B are among the possible targets of GC actions on TCR-stimulated T cells .
NF-AT and NF- « B were not significantly induced by IL-2 stimulation .
Our results showing that GC suppressed IL-5 production by human CD4* T cells activated by two distinct stimuli , TCR and IL-2R stimulation , underscore the efficacy of GC in the treatment of allergic diseases via suppression of T-cell IL-5 synthesis .

inducing IL-5 production by T cells .
IL-2 exerts its effects after binding with its receptor , which is composed of three subunits , IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) & , 3 , and y chain .
`` `` * '' The IL-2R signal activates multiple signal transduction pathways , eg , protein tyrosine kinases , '' PI-3 kinase , '' * and proto-oncogenes . ''
The signal transduced by IL-2R is reported to be very distinct from the signal transduced by T-cell receptor ( TCR ) in that ( 1 ) TCR signal induces Ca** influx but IL-2R signal does not , '' '' ( 2 ) TCR signal induces PI turnover but IL-2R signal does not , '' '' ( 3 ) TCR signal induces protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation but IL-2R signal does not , '' '' and ( 4 ) TCR signal is sensitive to FK506 and cyclosporin , but IL-2R signal is not . '' ''
It was also reported that TCR-induced cytokine production was inhibited by GC at quite low con-centrations , but , in contrast , the proliferation of murine cytotoxic T cells induced by IL-2 was affected only marginally by GC , '' suggesting that the TCR signal is mediated by quite distinct pathways from the IL-2R signal .
So it is now an intriguing question as to whether IL-2-induced IL-5 synthesis is inhibited by GC as effectively as TCR-stimulated IL-5 synthesis .
We showed here for the first time that GC inhibited IL-2-induced cytokine synthesis and proliferation of helper T cells .
Our results further supported the efficacy of GC for the treatment of atopic diseases by acting as IL-5 synthesis inhibitors .

RESULTS GC suppressed cytokine production of human T-cell clones stimulated via T-cell receptor complex .
The first experiment was performed to test whether IL-5 production of human helper T-cell clones is suppressed by GC .
T-cell clones were used for experiments at least 10 days after the last antigenic stimulation .
As described in the Materials and Methods , T cells obtained from the interface of Ficoll-Paque density gradient consisted of more than 98 % pure CD3¢* 2893 CD4* cells .
They were washed three times , resuspended in fresh medium , and stimulated via T-cell receptor using immobilized anti-CD3 MoAb .
Culture supernatants were harvested after 24 hours .
As shown in Fig 1 , all of the three agents , hydrocortisone ( A ) , prednisolone ( B ) , and dexamethasone ( C ) , suppressed the production of IL-5 by activated T-cell clones in a dose-dependent manner .
The concentrations of each agent required for half maximal inhibition ( IC , ) were ~100 nmol/L , ~20 nmol/L , and ~1 nmol/L , respectively .
All three agents did not alter the viability of cells after 24 hours of incubation at the concentrations used in these experiments , thereby excluding nonspecific toxicity of the agents ( data not shown ) .
The results clearly indicate that GC directly act on T cells to suppress IL-5 synthesis .
Dexamethasone suppressed IL-5 production induced by IL-2 .
_ We have recently reported that T-cell clones that produce IL-5 upon antigenic stimulation also produce IL-5 in response to IL-2 and that IL-5 production of peripheral T cells is dependent on IL-2 . ''
PI turnover , PKC activation , and Ca** influx were not observed in T cells stimulated with IL-2 , '' ** although these early biochemical events are the hallmarks of TCR-mediated T-cell activation . ''
TCR-induced proliferation of T cells is inhibited by FK506 , but IL-2-induced proliferation is not . '' ''
Therefore , the effects of GC on IL-2-induced IL-5 production were next examined .
T-cell clones HKS , YA5 , HK2 , and YAS were stimulated by recombinant human IL-2 ( 100 U/mL ) for 24 hours in the presence or absence of dexamethasone .
As shown in Fig 2 , dexamethasone clearly suppressed IL-5 production ( A ) and proliferation ( B ) of these T-cell clones in a dose-dependent manner , indicating that IL-2 signals leading to cytokine production and proliferation of helper T cells are both sensitive to GC .
Essentially the same results were obtained in five other T-cell clones , indicating that this observation was not restricted to these particular clones ( data not shown ) .
IL-2-induced proliferation of CTLL-2 cells is not affected by dexamethasone .
- Because dexamethasone-resistant proliferation of murine CD8* T cells stimulated with IL-2 was reported by previous investigators , '' '' we confirmed the inability of dexamethasone to suppress IL-2-induced proliferation employing a murine cytotoxic T-cell line , CTLL-2 , which is a well-characterized IL-2-dependent cell line commonly used for the bioassay of human IL-2 , murine IL-2 , and murine IL-4 . ''
As shown in Fig 3 , CTLL-2 cells proliferated in response to exogenous rIL-2 in a dose-dependent manner .
Dexamethasone at concentrations of 100 nmol/L and 1 pmol/ L did not significantly affect the proliferative response of CTLL-2 cells , suggesting that the IL-2R signal leading to the proliferation of CD8* ( cytotoxic ) T cells is transduced by GC-resistant signaling pathway ( s ) that is distinct from the IL-2R signal of CD4* T cells .
Dexamethasone suppressed IL-5 gene expressions .
We next examined the effects of dexamethasone on IL-5 gene expression using RT-PCR analysis .
T-cell clone ( Y¥AS ) was stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 MoAb or rIL-2 ( 100 U/mL ) for the designated time periods and total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted .
RNA was then reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR using primer sets specific for human IL-5 and B-actin .

A representative result is shown in Fig 4 .
IL-5 mRNA induced by either stimulus was totally downregulated by dexamethasone .
Essentially the same results were obtained when PCR was performed for 23 and 27 cycles , because the PCR reaction was linear between 23 and 30 cycles ( data not shown ) , indicating that the amounts of PCR products at 25 cycles well reflect the relative quantity of mRNA in the original RNA preparations .
Dexamethasone suppressed the transcriptional activity mediated by ~500-bp human IL-5 promoter/enhancer .
It has been shown that dexamethasone inhibits the induction of IL-2 gene transcription mainly by interfering with AP-1 MORI ET AL IL-5 production ( pg/ml ) 00 of 400 100 1000 Dexamethasone ( nM ) Fig 1 .

We used a transient transfection system to analyze whether dexamethasone suppresses human IL-5 transcriptional activity .
The 511-bp human IL-5 promoter/enhancer-luciferase gene construct , pIL-5 ( -511 ) Luc , was transiently transfected to T-cell clones by electroporation .
The transfected cells were then stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 MoAb or IL-2 for 24 hours .
As shown in Table 1 , luciferase activity was induced upon stimulation and was clearly downregulated by dexamethasone , indicating that the effect of GC on IL-5 synthesis is exerted at the level of gene transcription .
B-Galactosidase activity derived from pCMV -- gal , a transfection control , did not differ significantly either between stimulated and unstimulated cells or between GC -treated and GC-nontreated cells .
GC-sensitive transcription of pIL-5Luc was confirmed in two other T-cell clones ( HK2 and HK5 ) .

tion and were downregulated by dexamethasone .
Representative results are shown in Fig 5 .
Each band indicated by the arrowhead shows the specific binding that was diminished by the addition of excess amounts of unlabeled probes in the preliminary experiments ( data not shown ) .
NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF- « B binding activities were clearly upregulated in the nuclear protein preparations upon stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 MoAb .
Oct-1 binding activities were consti-tutively present in the stimulated and unstimulated nuclear proteins and were not affected by dexamethasone .
AP-1 and NF-kB binding activities were clearly downregulated by dexamethasone , suggesting that these transcription factors are the targets of GC action on IL-5 synthesis .
NF-AT binding was not affected by dexamethasone .
In contrast to the TCR stimulation , neither NF-AT nor NF- « B was significantly induced in the nuclear extracts of IL-2-stimulated T cells .
Essentially the same results were obtained in three other T-cell clones ( data not shown ) .
Although AP-1 and NF-AT are critical transcription factors for the induction of IL-2 gene , '' these findings suggest that IL-5 gene transcription using human helper T cells may occur in the absence of apparent induction of AP-1 and NF-AT and still in a manner sensitive to GC .
DISCUSSION In our present study , allergen-specific human T-cell clones established from atopic asthmatic donors were used to delineate the action of GC on IL-5 synthesis .
It was clearly shown that IL-5 synthesis of human helper T cells induced by two distinct stimuli mediated through TCR and IL-2R was completely suppressed by GC ( Figs 1 and 2 ) .
IL-5 mRNA expression induced by either stimulus was clearly downregulated by dexamethasone ( Fig 4 ) .

T-cell clones ( YA5 ) were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 MoAb or rIL-2 ( 100 U/mL ) for 2 hours .
Dexamethasone { 1 pmol/L ) was added to some cultures throughout the culture pe-riod , as indicated .
Nuclear proteins were then extracted and DNA binding activity was measured by EMSA .
Arrows indicate specific binding to NF-AT ( A ) , AP-1 ( B ) , NF- « B ( C ) , and Oct-1 ( D ) oligonucleo-tides .
molecular identification of the GC receptor ( GR ) . ''
GC exerts its effects through binding with its receptor existing in the cyto-plasm .
GC-GR complex can translocate into the nucleus and bind with the specific enhancer gene segment called glucocorticoid responsive element ( GRE ; GGTACANNNTGTTCT ) , either to enhance or suppress the target gene transcription .
In some in-stances , GC-GR complex interferes with the transcriptional activity of AP-1 , a ubiquitous transcription factor that is composed of Jun and Fos families ( c-Jun , Jun-B , Jun-D , c-Fos , FosB , Fral , and Fra ? )
through direct protein-protein interaction . ''
'' The inhibition of IL-2 enhancer by GC maps to the locus containing AP-1 element . ''
It is also reported that GC interfere with NF- « B activity through induction of IB synthesis . ''
Our present results are consistent with the previous reports that AP-1 and NF- « B are the targets of GC actions .
The possible location of AP-1 and NF- « B elements responsible for the GC sensitivity of human IL-5 gene warrants further investigation .
Because the CD3 molecule is a component of the T-cell receptor complex , the activation signal transduced by the cross-linkage of CD3 molecules is considered to mimic antigenic stimuli delivered through TCR under physiologic con 2897 ditions . ''
We and others reported that IL-5 synthesis of human PBMC was suppressed by GC . ''
Because GC induce anti-inflammatory second messengers , including lipocortins , in various cell populations , '' it is still unclear whether the suppressive effect of GC on IL-5 production is a direct action on T cells or an indirect one .
Our present findings indicate that GC can exert their effects directly on T cells , because the T-cell preparations used in our study consisted of more than 98 % pure T-cell populations .
In addition to the activating signal through T-cell receptor complex , exogenous IL-2 is sufficient to induce IL-5 synthesis by human allergen-specific T-cell clones . ''
Although the roles of Th2 cytokines in atopic diseases have been empha-sized , '' `` '' '' it has been reported that local IL-2 production was also enhanced during the late phase reaction after allergen exposure , '' '' '' '' suggesting the involvement of IL-2 ( Th1 cytokine ) in addition to Th2Z cytokines in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases .
So it is an intriguing question as to whether IL-2-induced IL-5 production is also suppressed by GC .
IL-2 induces PTK activation and PI-3 kinase activation , but neither Ca** mobilization , PI turnover , nor PKC activation occurs in T cells in response to IL-2 stimulation , '' '' '' * '' * '' whereas these early biochemical events are the hallmarks of TCR-mediated T-cell activation . '' '
TCR signal is sensitive to FK506 and cyclosporin A , but IL-2R signal is not , '' '' indicating that cytokine synthesis induced by TCR signal is transduced by a quite different pathway from that induced by IL-2R signal .
It was also reported that TCR-induced cytokine production was inhibited by quite low concentrations of GC , but , in contrast , the proliferation of murine cytotoxic T cells induced by IL-2 was affected only marginally by GC , '' suggesting that the signals mediating cytokine synthesis use different pathways from those mediating IL-2-induced cell proliferation in T cells .
It was clearly shown here for the first time that not only the proliferation but also IL-5 synthesis of human helper T cells induced by IL-2 is totally suppressed by GC .
These findings further support the efficacy of GC in the treatment of eosinophilic inflammation acting as IL-5 synthesis inhibitors .
GC suppressed the expression of IL-5 mRNA induced by IL-2 ( Fig 4 ) and at the same time suppressed the gene transcription mediated by the human IL-5 promoter/enhancer gene located 5 ' upstream of the coding region ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that GC exert their action on T cells at the transcriptional level .
EMSA analysis indicated that AP-1 and NF- « B complex were among the possible targets of GC action on TCR-stimulated helper T cells ( Fig 5 ) , which is consistent with previous reports . '' ''
Whether the effect of GC on IL-5 gene specifically maps to AP-1 or NF- « B element within human IL-5 promoter/enhancer gene should further be determined by the transfection analysis using mutant promoter/enhancer plas-mids as performed in IL-2 gene.60 AP-1 , NF- « B , and NF-AT binding was not detectable after IL-ZR stimulation , in contrast to TCR stimulation , despite the fact that endogenous IL-5 gene expression ( Fig 4 ) and transcriptional activity as determined by pIL-5 ( -511 ) Luc ( Table 1 ) induced by either TCR or IL-2R stimulation were quite comparable , suggesting that AP-1 and NF- « B activities seem to be important for IL-5 synthesis induced by TCR stimulation , but are not essential From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

2898 for IL-5 synthesis induced by IL-2 .
Because the induction of NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF- « B complexes in IL-2-stimulated T cells may follow different kinetics than in TCR-stimulated cells , we examined NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF- « B binding activities at different time points after IL-2 and TCR stimulation .
No significant binding activities of NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-xB were detected at 0.5 , 1 , and 4 hours after IL-2 stimulation , in accordance with the results obtained at 2 hours ( shown in Fig 5 ) , although those binding activities were clearly induced by TCR stimulation ( data not shown ) .
The present findings suggest that GC may exert their effects through affecting a still unknown transcription factor ( s ) other than AP-1 , NF-AT , NF- « B , and Oct-1 , and a GC-sensitive unique transcription factor ( s ) might regulate human IL-5 gene activation in allergic diseases associated with eosinophilic inflammation such as asthma and atopic dermatitis .
To date , several transcription elements , including AP-1 , NF- « B , NF-AT , Oct-1 , GATA , and conserved lymphokine element 0 ( CLEO ) , have been indicated by the EMSA and homology search analyses .
`` `` * '' '' NF-AT binding activity was induced in an activated murine mast cell line and the human IL-5 sequence between -120 and -98 corresponded to the activity . '' ''
Both GATA binding element located -82 to -62 and CLEO element located -56 to -42 are essential for the spontaneous , not inducible , transcriptional activity expressed in an adult T-cell leukemia virus-transformed T-cell line . ''
Two octamer binding sites located -244 to -237 and somewhere between -67 and -30 were also identified . ''
Our results showing that human IL-5 promoter/enhancer-luciferase gene construct transfected to T-cell clones was transcribed upon stimulation and was downregulated by dexamethasone ( Table 1 ) indicate that the approximately 500-bp human IL-5 gene segment located 5 ' upstream of the coding region contains an activation-inducible enhancer element ( s ) regulated by GC .
Because the function of transcription factors is context-dependent , it is essential to determine ( 1 ) whether those possible elements homologous to the consensus binding sequences of known transcription factors such as NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-KB really bind their corresponding transcription factors and ( 2 ) whether those elements and transcription factors are functionally active in human helper T cells and regulated by GC .
The studies necessary to answer these questions are currently being undertaken using transient transfection systems , EMSA , and footprint analyses using genuine human IL-5 sequences .
The further identification of IL-2-responsive and GC-sensitive transcriptional elements in the human IL-5 promoter/enhancer gene will improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human T-cell IL-5 synthesis and may facilitate future therapeutic intervention for severe atopic diseases by the development of selective IL-5 synthesis inhibitors .
