Stimulation of Neutrophil Interleukin-8 Production by Eosinophil Granule Major Basic Protein Scott M. Page , Gerald J. Gleich , Kenneth A. Roebuck , and Larry L. Thomas Department of Immunology/Microbiology , Rush Medical College , Chicago , Illinois ; and Departments of Immunology and Medicine , Mayo Clinic and Foundation , Rochester , Minnesota We evaluated the ability of eosinophil granule major basic protein ( MBP ) to stimulate interleukin ( IL ) -8 production by neutrophils .
MBP over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 M stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml IL-8 .
Incubation with 2 M MBP showed that , after a 1 h lag , the level of IL-8 release increased with time for approximately 10 h. At the 2 uM concentration , eosinophil cationic protein , eosinophil-derived neurotoxin , and eosinophil peroxidase did not stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production .
MBP stimulated 2-fold increases in IL-8 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) after 1 and 3 h of incubation , which were blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D. However , stimulation with MBP did not produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B or activator protein-1 .
No NF-IL-6 binding activity was detected in the same nuclear extracts .
In addition , stimulation with MBP prolonged the stability of IL-8 mRNA .
MBP also induced transient increases in mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1a « and ( B , but did not stimulate the release of either chemokine .
These findings indicate that MBP is selective among the eosinophil granule proteins as a stimulus for neutrophil IL-8 release and , further , that stimulation of neutrophil IL-8 release by MBP involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation .
We postulate that MBP-induced release of IL-8 by neutrophils may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases .

Major basic protein ( MBP ) is a 13.9-kD protein localized to the crystalloid core of eosinophil secondary granules and implicated in many of the proinflammatory actions of eosinophils ( 1 ) .
Through its many actions , MBP contributes to generation of the inflammatory milieu and to the airway hyperreactivity characteristic of chronic asthma .
Of interest among the activities reported for MBP is its capacity to activate neutrophils , as shown by our findings that MBP in concentrations similar to those detected in sputum of symptomatic asthmatic patients stimulates neutrophil superoxide anion production ( 2 ) and increases neutrophil ( Received in original form December 22 , 1998 and in revised form March 3 , 1999 ) Address correspondence to : Larry L.

Two other basic proteins present in eosinophil granules , eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin ( EDN ) ( 1 ) , were without effect at a concentration optimal for MBP ( 2 , 3 ) .
Together , the results of several studies have suggested the involvement of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of acute asthma .
Acute exacerbations of asthma and status asthmaticus are associated with increased levels of neutrophils in sputum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( 4-6 ) , and neutrophils were found to predominate within the airway submucosa of patients who died of a `` sudden-onset form of fatal asthma '' ( 7 ) .
Importantly , neutrophil presence in the airway in acute asthma is superimposed on the eosinophilia characteristic of asthma ( 4-6 ) .
That eosinophil products , and in particular MBP , may contribute to neutrophil activation is supported by two observations .
First , both eosinophils and neutrophils are activated during acute exacerbations of asthma ( 5 , 6 ) , and second , the activated neutrophils are localized to the same sites as the activated eosinophils and discharged granule basic proteins ( 7 ) .
Interleukin ( IL ) -8 is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils ( 8-10 ) .
In the lungs , IL-8 appears to be the primary chemoattractant for neutrophils ( 11 ) , and accordingly is directly implicated in the neutrophil accumulation that follows acute respiratory infection ( 12 ) .
Al Page , Gleich , Roebuck , et al .
: Stimulation of Neutrophil IL-8 Production 231 though IL-8 is produced by a wide variety of cell types ( 13 ) , it is of particular interest , given its biologic activity , that IL-8 is also synthesized and released by neutrophils in response to a number of inflammatory mediators ( 14-18 ) .
Thus , IL-8 production by neutrophils can contribute to additional neutrophil recruitment and , importantly , can also enhance or prolong neutrophil activation in an autocrinelike manner .
Earlier results had shown that MBP can stimulate IL-8 production by eosinophils in a transcription-dependent manner ( 19 ) .
We therefore postulated that MBP may likewise stimulate IL-8 production by neutrophils .
The results presented here confirm this hypothesis and show that the MBP acts through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events .

An oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus binding site for NF-IL-6 was generously provided by Dr. Steven Ackerman ( University of Illinois at Chicago ) .
Eosinophil Granule Proteins MBP , ECP , EDN , and eosinophil peroxidase ( EPO ) were isolated as described previously from eosinophils of patients with the hypereosinophlic syndrome ( 20 , 21 ) .
The proteins were pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R 250 .
The EPO was enzymatically active as determined with a previously described method ( 22 ) .
Endotoxin content in the granule proteins was measured with the L imulus amebocyte lysate assay ( Associates of Cape Cod , Falmouth , MA ) .
Neutrophil Isolation Neutrophils were isolated under sterile conditions from the venous blood of healthy adult volunteers through den sity gradient centrifugation as previously described ( 23 ) .
The neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 100 U/ml !
penicillin , 100 g/m !
streptomycin , and 2 mM L-glutamine ( RPMI ) .
Incubation Conditions for Measurement of Chemokine Release Neutrophils ( 108 cells ) were incubated with the stimuli in RPMI containing 10 % heat-inactivated ( 56°C ; 45 min ) autologous serum ( added separately to the incubation con-tents ) in 24-well tissue culture plates for the indicated times at 37°C in a 5 % CO , atmosphere .
Spontaneous IL-8 production was determined with cells incubated under the same conditions in the absence of stimulus , and the effect of the MBP vehicle buffer ( 25 mM sodium acetate , 150 mM sodium chloride , pH 4.3 ) was examined by addition of the buffer in the same volumes as required for MBP addi-tion .
Total incubation volume was 0.5 ml .
The reactions were terminated by centrifugation at 400 X g for 10 min at 4°C , and the cell-free supernatants were stored at -20°C until the levels of IL-8 , MIP-1 « , and MIP-1B were measured with a specific ELISA .
Ribonuclease Protection Assay Neutrophils ( 10 ' cells/ml ) were incubated with MBP or LPS in RPMI supplemented with 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.4 , and containing 10 % heat-inactivated autologous serum in 15-ml round-bottom polypropylene tubes for the indicated times at 37°C in an oscillating water bath .
Total incubation volume was 2 ml .
For some samples , actinomycin D ( 5 g/ ml ) was added 1 h before or after incubation with the stim-uli , as indicated in the text .
The reactions were terminated by centrifugation at 300 X g for 10 min at 4°C .
The cell pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at 4°C , and total RNA was isolated from 2 X 10 '' neutrophils using Trizol reagent ( Life Technologies , Inc. , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
For the ribonuclease ( RNase ) protection assay , we used the RiboQuant multiprobe RNase protection assay ( hCK-5 ; PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) .
The complementary DNA ( cDNA ) probes were radiolabeled with [ « -P ] UTP , and the assay was performed exactly as described elsewhere ( 24 ) .
Positive messenger RNA ( mRNA ) bands were quantified densitometrically using a STORM phosphorimager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) , and mRNA levels of the chemokines were normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Neutrophils ( 10 ' cells/ml ) were incubated with MBP , EDN , or LPS in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mM Hepes , pH 74 , in 15-ml round-bottom polypropylene tubes for 20 min or 1 h at 37°C .
Total incubation volume was 1 ml .
The reactions were stopped by transfer of the mixtures to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifugation at 300 X g for 10 min at 4°C .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cell pellets as described by Osborn and colleagues ( 25 ) using a modification of the protease inhibitor cocktail described by McDonald and coworkers ( 26 ) .
Briefly , 10 '' cells were washed twice in ice-cold Buffer A { 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 ; 1.5 mM MgCl ) ; ; 10 mM KCl ; and 0.5 mM DTT ) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ( 4 mM 232 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOL .

Inhibition of binding through use of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled specific probe or an irrelevant probe ( AP-2 for NF-kB , and Oct-1 for AP-1 and NF-IL-6 ) was evaluated to determine the specificity of the detection .
Samples were run on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel and exposed to X-OMAT-AR film ( Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) at -70°C .

A value of P < 0.05 was accepted as significant .
Results Concentration-Dependence and Time Course for MBP-Stimulated IL-8 Production The capacity of MBP to stimulate neutrophil IL-8 production was evaluated over the concentration range of 0.1-10 M MBP .
As shown in Figure 1 , incubating neutrophils with 0.1 jwM or 0.3 wM MBP for 18 h at 37°C produced negligible IL-8 release .
MBP in concentrations of 1-10 pM , however , stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml IL-8 in a concentration-dependent manner .
To avoid possible cytotoxic effects that may be associated with high concentrations of MBP ( 1 ) , the time course for MBP -stimulated IL-8 production was determined with 2 uM $ 000 2500 2000 1500 IL-8 .

: Stimulation of Neutrophil IL-8 Production 233 MBP .
The results , in Figure 2 , show that a statistically significant level of IL-8 release occurred after 2 h of incubation with MBP , and that the level of MBP -induced IL-8 release then increased with time for up to 10 h of incubation .
An additional 10 h of incubation with MBP resulted in only a minimal further increase in the amount of IL-8 re-leased .
Stimulation of Neutrophil IL-8 Production by Eosinophil Granule Basic Proteins The ability of the three other basic eosinophil granule proteins to likewise stimulate neutrophil IL-8 production at a concentration effective for MBP was evaluated by incubating neutrophils with 2 wM MBP , ECP , EDN , or EPO for 18 h at 37°C .
MBP stimulated the release of approximately 1,800 pg/ml IL-8 ( Figure 3 ) ; however , neither ECP nor EDN stimulated IL-8 release , and EPO stimulated the release of 130 pg/ml IL-8 , a level that was not statistically significant .
The addition of 40-1,000 wM H,0 , did not enhance the ability of EPO to stimulate IL-8 release , and EPO was similarly ineffective at lower concentrations ( 0.03-0.3 wM ) reported to induce shape changes in neutrophils ( 27 ) ( results not shown ) .

Induction of chemokine mRNA synthesis by MBP and LPS .
( A ) Neutrophils ( 10'/ml ) were preincubated in the presence or absence of 5 ug/ml actinomycin D ( Act .
D ) for 1 h at 37°C .
The cells were then incubated with 5 wM MBP or 1 g/ml LPS , or in RPMI alone ( Spont ) , for 1 or 3 h. Expression of IL-8 , MIP-1 @ , MIP-1f , released on activation , normal T-cell-expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) , MCP-1 , IP-10 , 1-309 , L-32 , and GAPDH mRNA was determined by RNase protection assay .
Only positive mRNA bands are labeled ; note that IL-8 mRNA and MIP-1la mRNA each run as a doublet .
( B ) The positive mRNA bands of the three chemokines ( A ) were quantified densitometrically and were normalized to the density of GAPDH mRNA .
The results are presented as the fold increase in mRNA level for each of the three chemokines relative to the mRNA level in unstimulated cells ( Spont ) .
polymer of L-arginine ( Poly-R ) and of protamine , a 4.8-kD protein containing 66 % arginine ( 28 ) , to stimulate IL-8 production were also evaluated in the same experiments in order to further assess the contribution of the basic charge of the MBP molecule to its activity .
Incubation of neutrophils with 0.3 M Poly-R , which corresponds on a weight basis to the arginine content of 2 M MBP ( 1 ) , or with 2 M protamine , resulted in the release of less than 70 pg/ml IL-8 ( Figure 3 ) .
In the same experiments , 100 ng/ml LPS stimulated the release of 1,280 pg/ml IL-8 .
MBP-Stimulated IL-8 Production by Neutrophils Is Independent of Endotoxin As reported previously by others ( 14 ) , and as shown earlier ( Figure 3 ) , LPS is an effective stimulus for neutrophil IL-8 production .
Measurement of endotoxin content in the granule protein preparations indicated that a 2 M concentration of the granule proteins contained endotoxin levels of 0.1 ng/ml ( MBP ) , 0.8 ng/ml ( ECP ) , 0.7 ng/ml ( EDN ) , and 1.8 ng/ml ( EPO ) , which did not correlate with the abilities of the proteins to stimulate neutrophil IL-8 production ( Figure 3 ) .
Additional results showed that heating MBP for 5 min at 100°C abrogated by more than 90 % the ability of 2 wM MBP to stimulate IL-8 production ( n = 3 ; data not shown ) .
In contrast , heating did not reduce the activity of LPS in the same experiments .
Induction of IL-8 mRNA Synthesis by MBP To assess the effect of MBP stimulation on IL-8 mRNA synthesis , as well as to screen for the synthesis of additional chemokines , an RNase protection assay was performed after incubating neutrophils with 5 wM MBP or , as a positive control , 1 pg/ml LPS for 1 h and 3 h at 37°C .
IL-8 mRNA was detected at 1 h and to a lesser extent at 3 h in unstimulated neutrophils , but incubation with MBP produced additional 2-fold increases ( relative to the unstimulated cells ) in the level of IL-8 mRNA at both 1 h and 3 h ( Figures 4A and 4B ) .
MBP also stimulated increases in mRNA for MIP-1 « and ( 5-fold and 3-fold , respectively ) at 1 h ; however , the increases were absent at the 3-h time point .
Incubation with LPS stimulated increases in the level of IL-8 mRNA at the 3-h time point and in the levels of MIP-la and MIP-1B mRNA at both time points ( Figures 4A and 4B ) .
Of note was that prein-cubating the neutrophils with 5 pg/ml actinomycin D for 1 h at 37°C before addition of the stimuli blocked all the observed increases in IL-8 mRNA , as well as in MIP-la and MIP-1B mRNA ( Figure 4A ) .
Preincubation with 5 pg/ml actinomycin D also blocked MBP-stimulated release of IL-8 protein ( n = 3 ; data not shown ) .
Absence of MBP-Stimulated MIP-1 « and MIP-1f6 Production With MBP stimulating transient increases in MIP-l « and MIP-1B mRNA ( Figure 4A ) , the ability of MBP to stimulate release of MIP-la « or protein was evaluated .
Results obtained in two separate experiments showed that incubating neutrophils with 2 MBP for 18 h at 37°C stimulated the release of up to 3,400 pg/ml IL-8 , but caused 234 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOL .

In the same experiments , 100 ng/ml LPS stimulated the release of up to approximately 1,400 pg/ml IL-8 , 700 pg/ml MIP-1 « , and 2,400 pg/ml MIP-1fB .
Effect of MBP Stimulation on the Binding Activities of NF-B , AP-1 , and NF-IL-6 The finding ( Figure 4A ) that actinomycin D blocked the MBP -stimulated increase in IL-8 mRNA indicated the involvement of a transcriptional event in MBP -induced IL-8 release .
With activation of NF-KB alone or in combination with AP-1 or NF-IL-6 responsible for the transcriptional regulation of IL-8 synthesis in many cells ( 29-31 ) , the ability of MBP to activate NF-KB , AP-1 , and NF-IL-6 was evaluated in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
As shown in Figure 5 , incubating neutrophils with 5 wM MBP for 20 or 60 min at 37°C did not stimulate an increase in the binding activities of NF-KB or AP-1 .

A 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe ( Specific ) or unlabeled nonspecific probe ( AP-2 for NF-KB and Oct-1 for AP-1 ) were included in the assay as indicated .
The results of a single experiment that is representative of two additional experiments are shown .
1 g/ml LPS produced an increase in NF- « B binding activity after 20 min of incubation , and increases in the binding activities of NF-kB and AP-1 after 60 min .
A 50-fold molar excess of the specific unlabeled oligonucleotide blocked detectable binding activity of both NF-kB and AP-1 ( Figure 5 ) .
The NF- « B binding activity was also partly inhibited by an unlabeled irrelevant oligonucleotide ( AP-2 ) , indicating that a portion of the observed binding activity was nonspecific .
No NF-IL-6 binding activity was detected in any of the experiments ( data not shown ) .

Neutrophils were incubated with 5 M MBP or 1 pg/ml LPS for 2 h at 37°C , and 5 ug/ml actinomycin D was then added ( time zero ) .
The level of IL-8 mRNA and , for com-parison , the levels of MIP-1a « and MIP-1B mRNA , were measured with the RNase protection assay at time zero and after an additional 1 , 2 , and 4 h of incubation at 37°C in the presence of the actinomycin D. The results show that more than 80 % of the IL-8 mRNA in the MBP-stimulated neutrophils was still present after 4 h of incubation with the actinomycin D , whereas 50 % of the IL-8 mRNA in unstimulated neutrophils was degraded by approximately 2.5 h ( Figure 6 ) .
Incubation with MBP also increased the stability of MIP-1B mRNA ( T ; , ~ 2 h in MBP -stimulated cells , versus T ; , < 1 h in unstimulated cells ) .
In contrast , incubation with LPS enhanced the mRNA stability of all three chemokines ( Figure 6 ) .
Discussion These results described show that MBP is an effective stimulus for IL-8 production by neutrophils .
As such , MBP joins a prominent list of inflammatory reactants known to stimulate IL-8 release by neutrophils ( 14-18 , 32 ) .
The level of IL-8 production stimulated by MBP is comparable to that stimulated by optimal concentrations of LPS , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -a « , IL-1 $ B , and formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine ( 14-18 ) , indicating a similar efficacy for MBP and these stimuli .
MBP , however , is less potent than many of the other inflammatory reactants , with MBP stimulating IL-8 release at concentrations above 1 M. A Ithough the concentrations of MBP achieved locally within tissues can not be quantified , MBP levels of up to approximately 90 ug/ml have been measured in the sputum of symptomatic asthma patients ( 33 ) .
These values , together with an MBP content of approximately 9 jwg/10® eosinophils ( 34 ) , suggest that the 2 M concentration of MBP , which was consistently found to be effective in the present study , can at least be approached within the tissues .
The results presented here clearly exclude any possible LPS contamination as a basis for the MBP activity .
Indeed , whereas LPS stimulates a prolonged ( at least 20 h ) release of IL-8 by neutrophils ( 14 , 16 ) , release of IL-8 stimulated by MBP tended to reach a plateau with respect to time after approximately 10 h of incubation .
Given this , the time course for MBP-stimulated IL-8 release is similar to the time course for IL-8 release stimulated by TNF-a or IL-1 $ B ( 14 ) .
These results also show that among the basic proteins present in eosinophil granules , MBP is unique in its ability to stimulate neutrophil IL-8 production , at least at a concentration consistently effective for MBP .
In this regard , the present findings are in agreement with earlier observations that ECP , EDN , and EPO do not share the ability of MBP to stimulate neutrophil superoxide anion production at a concentration optimal for MBP ( 2 ; S. Page and L. Thomas , unpublished observation ) .
A Ithough it is possible that higher concentrations of ECP , EDN , or EPO may stimulate IL-8 release by neutrophils , such concentrations would begin to exceed concentrations plausibly expected to be achieved clinically .
Further , it is worth noting that when expressed in g/ml protein , the 2 M concentrations of the 21-kD ECP and 66-kD EPO ( 1 ) are 50 % and almost 5S-fold greater , respectively , than that of the same concentration of 13.9-kD MBP .
EPO also did not stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production at the concentrations ( 0.1-0.3 wM ) previously reported to stimulate neutrophil aggregation and adherence ( 27 ) .
In addition , although the enzymatic activity of EPO is responsible for some EPO actions ( 35 , 36 ) , EPO did not stimulate IL-8 release in the presence of its substrate , H,0 ; .
This finding may partly reflect the use of chloride , which is less optimal than iodide or bromide ( 35 , 37 ) , as a halide for EPO enzymatic activity , but it has also been reported that the enzymatic activity of EPO is inhibited after binding of EPO to neutrophils ( 27 ) .
A striking feature of the MBP molecule is its strongly basic charge ( 1 ) , and , indeed , many of the activities described for MBP have been attributed to its charge .
The failure , however , of both ECP , which has a charge similar to that of MBP ( pI values of 10.8 and 10.9 , respectively ) and a similar arginine content ( 14 % each ) , and of EPO , which is likewise strongly basic ( pI of 10.8 ) ( 1 ) , to stimulate neutrophil IL-8 release suggests that the basic charge alone does not account for the activity of MBP .
In support of this conclusion , it has been found that protamine , a 4.8-kD polypeptide of which 66 % consists of arginine ( 28 ) , and a 14-kD polymer of L-arginine ( Poly-R ) , at a concentration equivalent to the arginine content of MBP , also do not stimulate IL-8 release .
Interestingly , it has recently been reported that MBP also stimulates TNF-a production by murine bone marrow-derived mast cells after priming by stem-cell factor ( 38 ) .
In contrast , poly-L-arginine was found to stimulate TNF- « release independently of priming by stem-cell factor ( 38 ) .
Earlier results demonstrated the capacity of MBP to stimulate IL-8 production by eosinophils via a transcrip-tion-dependent mechanism , as shown by inhibition of MBP -induced increases in IL-8 mRNA by actinomycin D ( 19 ) .
The results presented here indicate that MBP -stimulated IL-8 release by neutrophils is likewise the result of new protein synthesis , since actinomycin D blocked the MBP -stimulated increases in both IL-8 mRNA synthesis and IL-8 protein release .
MBP -induced IL-8 synthesis ap-pears , however , to occur independently of an increase in the binding activity of NF-kB , which alone or in combination with AP-1 or NF-IL-6 regulates IL-8 gene transcription in many cell types ( 29-31 ) .
MBP stimulation was likewise not accompanied by an increase in the binding activity of AP-1 , and no NF-IL-6 binding activity was detected in the neutrophil extracts in our experiments .
In accordance with previous reports ( 26 , 39 ) , LPS-induced activation was accompanied by increases in the binding activities of both NF-kB and AP-1 , although a portion of the observed increase in NF- « B binding activity was nonspecific .
Recently , it has been suggested that activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( NF-AT ) by a sustained increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration may contribute to the regulation of IL-8 synthesis in neutrophils ( 40 ) .
MBP , however , stimulates an increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration only in cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils ( 23 ) , which were not used in the present study .
Alternatively , the possibility that the transcriptional regulation of MBP -induced IL-8 synthesis in neutrophils re 236 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOL .
21 1999 quires a novel transcription factor ( s ) , or is due to the inhibition or removal of a repressor protein such as Oct-1 , which negatively regulates IL-8 synthesis ( 41 ) , can not be excluded .
The present results indicate that the regulation of MBP -stimulated IL-8 production in neutrophils may also occur posttranscriptionally through stabilization of IL-8 mRNA , as observed in other cells in response to various stimuli ( 42-45 ) .
The 3 ' untranslated region of IL-8 mRNA contains tandem repeats of adenine/uracil ( A U ) -rich regions that are often associated with unstable mRNA ( 46 ) .
Specific AU-binding proteins have been identified ( 47 , 48 ) , and the finding that cycloheximide induces large increases in IL-8 mRNA ( 43 , 49 ) has implicated the binding of specific proteins to AU-rich regions in the targeting of IL-8 mRNA for degradation .
Specific AU-binding proteins have not yet been identified in neutrophils , but a similar mechanism probably occurs in neutrophils .
Cycloheximide induces large increases in neutrophil IL-8 mRNA levels ( 14 , 50 ) , and the inhibition of LPS-stimulated IL-8 production by IL-10 ( 51 , 52 ) is correlated with a decreased stability of IL-8 mRNA that depends on protein synthesis ( 51 ) .
IL-10 likewise inhibits LPS-stimulated production of MIP-1a « and MIP-1B by a similar mechanism ( 51 ) .
Interestingly , MBP also stabilized MIP-1B mRNA , but not for the same duration as IL-8 mRNA .
Thus , the findings that MBP stimulated larger but more transient increases in MIP-1 « and MIP-1B mRNA , but did not stimulate MIP-la or MIP-1B protein production , suggest that prolonged stability of IL-8 mRNA plays a major role in the action of MBP .
It is worth noting in this context that the IL-8 mRNA level in unstimulated neutrophils was increased at 1 h in the present experiments .
Adherence to plastic has been shown to induce increases in neutrophil IL-8 mRNA levels ( 14 ) , and the possibility that adherence contributes to the increase observed here can not be excluded .
In any event , the increased IL-8 mRNA level found in unstimulated neutrophils would provide a basis for the posttranscriptional effect of MBP .
Although MBP was first recognized for its cytotoxicity ( 1 ) , it is now clear that this protein also exhibits many noncytotoxic activities , including the stimulation of neutrophil IL-8 production .
Besides being a potent chemoattractant and stimulus for neutrophils ( 8 , 10 ) , IL-8 is also a chemoattractant for T-lymphocytes ( 53 ) and for IL-5-primed eosinophils ( 54 ) , as well as a stimulus for basophils primed by IL-3 ( 55 ) .
In addition , recent findings obtained with the human mast cell line HMC-1 indicate that IL-8 may also be chemotatic for mast cells ( 56 ) .
Thus , MBP -induced IL-8 production by neutrophils could contribute to inflammatory events characteristic of chronic asthma .
However , we propose that the effect of MBP on neutrophil IL-8 release may be even more relevant to the pathophysiology of acute asthma .
In addition to promoting additional neutrophil influx , IL-8 release could enhance or prolong neutrophil activation in an autocrinelike manner .
The resulting increased release of elastase and other neutrophil mediators ( 57 ) could exacerbate changes such as formation of the mucus plugs observed in fatal asthma ( 7 ) .
An association between eosinophil infiltrates and exacerbations in chronic bronchitis ( 58 ) suggests that MBP -stimulated IL-8 production may also have implications for other inflammatory lung diseases .
