3 , A-6020 Innsbruck , Austria Corresponding author Communicated by P.Herrlich Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes , which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in various diseases including leukemia , depends on the glucocorticoid receptor .
However , the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are not under-stood .
A prevailing hypothesis postulates induction of so-called 'lysis genes ' by the activated receptor .
In this study , we show that an activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant is as effective as the wild-type receptor in repression of AP-1 activity , inhibition of interleukin-2 production , inhibition of c-mye expression and induction of apoptosis .
Furthermore , we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor , whose repressive functions but not target site specificity , are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor .
Therefore , the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression rather than activation and could be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival .
Key words : apoptosis/glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid recep-tor/leukemia Introduction Glucocorticoids have wide medical applications for their immunosuppressive , anti-inflammatory and , in some cells , cytostatic effects .
Glucocorticoids are key elements in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis , collagen diseases , lymphatic leukemias and lymphomas ( Parillo and Fauci , 1979 ; Haynes , 1990 ) .
Despite their importance , use of glucocorticoids in these conditions is largely empirical and the mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects are poorly understood ( Haynes , 1990 ) .
One relevant mechanism may be the induction of cell death .
Glucocorticoids kill immature thymocytes by activating a suicide process referred to as apoptosis or programmed cell death ( Wyllie , 1980 ; Ucker , 1987 ; Cohen , 1989 ) .
Likewise , several leukemic cell lines undergo this type of cell death in response to glucocorticoids ( Baxter et al. , 1971 ; Sibley et al. , 1974 ; Bourgeois and Newby , 1977 ; Norman et al. , 452 1977 ) .
In addition , glucocorticoids were reported to induce apoptosis in mature , activated , peripheral T lymphocytes ( Galili , 1983 ) .
Therefore , induction of apoptosis may be one of the key mechanisms mediating the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids in the treatment of leukemias , lymphomas and various autoimmune disorders .
The glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) is required for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis ( Baxter et al. , 1971 ; Sibley et al. , 1974 ) , but the GR domains necessary for induction of apoptosis have been controversial ( Nazareth et al. , 1991 ; Dicken and Miesfeld , 1992 ) , as have been the relevant events following GR activation by the ligand ( Caron-Leslie et al. , 1991 ; Dowd and Miesfeld , 1992 ; Shi et al. , 1992 ; Thulasi et al. , 1993 ) .
Based on the ability of activated steroid receptors to stimulate gene expression ( Yamamoto and Alberts , 1975 ) , it was suggested that glucocorticoid-dependent apoptosis is mediated by induction of so-called 'lysis genes ' ( Gasson and Bourgeois , 1983 ) .
However , despite major efforts , such glucocorticoid-inducible 'lysis genes ' have not yet been identified .
Other relevant mechanisms that could mediate the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids are inhibition of cell proliferation ( reviewed by Cupps and Fauci , 1982 ) and inhibition of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production by activated T cells ( Gillis et al. , 1979 ; Arya et al. , 1984 ) .
The latter mechanism is of importance for the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids because IL-2 production is critical for clonal expansion of T cells and other immune functions ( Gillis et al. , 1979 ; Cantrell and Smith , 1984 ) .
It was suggested that the inhibition of cell proliferation and IL-2 production is mediated by the recently discovered ability of activated GR to interfere with transcriptional activation by other transcription factors , especially AP-1 ( Jonat et al. , 1990 ; Schiile et al. , 1990 ; Yang-Yen et al. , 1990 ) .
This hypothesis was based not only on the ability of activated GR to inhibit AP-1 activity , but also on the known involvement of AP-1 in cell proliferation ( Kovary and Bravo , 1991 ; reviewed by Angel and Karin , 1991 ) and IL-2 induction ( Serfling et al. , 1989 ; Jain et al. , 1992 ) .
Indeed , analysis of the cis elements through which glucocorticoids inhibit IL-2 production failed to identify GR binding sites ( GREs ) and implicated sites recognized by AP-1 as mediators of this effect ( Vacca et al. , 1990 ; Northrop et al. , 1992 ) .
Such findings raised the possibility that induction of T cell apoptosis may also be mediated by interference with transcription factors , such as AP-1 , required for cell survival rather than direct induction of 'lysis genes ' .
To test this possibility we introduced into a GR-deficient T cell leukemia cell line , expression vectors encoding either a wild type ( wt ) GR or a mutant derivative that is defective in gene activation but fully competent in interference with AP-1 activity .
We found that clones expressing this mutant GR were fully sensitive to glucocorticoids , both in respect of inhibition of IL-2 production © Oxford University Press n # 0 m `` p f < aA x A / f * G o s C ( « ] Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis o 2 a Fig .

Cells were cotransfected with -73CoI-LUC and the respective GR expression vectors or the empty expression vector pRC/Bact , grown overnight and treated for 8 h with vehicle alone or TPA ( 50 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 4 uM ) in the absence or presence of 10~ M dex .
Dex was added 1 h previous to TPA and ionomycin .
( D ) Dex-dependent induction of a MMTV-LTR containing two consensus GREs .
TAg-Jurkat cells were cotransfected with MMTV-LUC and the same expression vectors as in ( A ) .
107 '' M dex or vehicle alone was added 1 h after transfection and cells were harvested after 14 h. and in undergoing apoptosis .
Another GR mutant with a deletion of the N-terminal activation domain was also still able to interfere with AP-1 activity and mediate glucocorticoid-dependent apoptosis .
Likewise , stable expression of the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR ) , which binds to different response elements than those recognized by the GR ( reviewed by Glass and Rosenfeld , 1991 ) , but has similar AP-1 interfering activity ( Schiile et al. , 1991 ; Yang-Yen et al. , 1991 ) conferred upon Jurkat cells susceptibility to all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced apoptosis .
Results To stably express various versions of the rat GR in a subclone of the human T cell leukemia-derived Jurkat cell line , which does not express a functional endogenous GR , we constructed expression vectors containing wt or mutant GRs under control of a B-actin promoter .
Mutant LS7 ( Godowski et al. , 1989 ) contains two adjacent amino acid substitutions in the second half of the second zinc finger , replacing Pro493 and Alad494 by Arg and Ser , respectively ( Figure 1A ) .
LS7 was reported to have little or no transactivating potential , while retaining suppressing activity on the bovine prolactin promoter ( Godowski et al. , 1989 ) .
Likewise , the ability of LS7 to interfere with AP-1-mediated transactivation of the collagenase promoter was comparable with that of wt GR ( Yang-Yen et al. , 1990 ) .
Mutant NDel encodes a truncated receptor lacking the amino terminal activation domain ( Figure 1B ) .
Transient transfections were performed to check the function of the constructs and to determine the relative ability of the receptor mutants to repress AP-1 activity and to transactivate in Jurkat cells ( Figure 1C and D ) .
-73Col-LUC , containing a truncated collagenase promoter ( Deng and Karin , 1993 ) , was used as an AP-1-dependent reporter to examine the ability of the various GRs to interfere with AP-1 activity .
AP-1 activity , as measured by -73Col-LUC expression , was not detected in non-activated Jurkat cells , but was strongly induced upon cell activation with TPA and the Ca*+*-ionophore ionomycin .
All GR types , but not the empty expression vector , markedly suppressed this induction in response to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( dex ) ( Figure 1C ) .
No considerable differences in their AP-1 interfering activity were observed .
GRE-mediated transactivation was determined by a MMTV-LUC reporter containing two consensus GREs ( Drouin et al. , 1993 ) ( Figure 1D ) .

results in CV-1 cells , LS7 exhibited minimal transactivating potential , while GR-NDel demonstrated intermediate dex-dependent transactivation amounting to 40 % of GR-wt , mirroring the activity of the similarly structured mutant A77-262 in CV-1 cells ( Yang-Yen et al. , 1990 ) .
Using these plasmids , several stably transfected cell clones were isolated that constitutively expressed either wt GR or one of the mutants .
GRE-mediated transactivation in GR-wt , GR-LS7 clones and in parental Jurkat cells is shown in Figure 2 .
The difference in activation of transiently transfected MMTV-LUC between GR-wt and GR-LS7 clones was found to be ~10- to 20-fold at maximum receptor occupancy , at and above 10~8 M dex .
Dex concentrations considerably below the one commonly used ( 10~° M ) efficiently inhibited proliferation of clones expressing either GR type ( Table 1 ) .
Inhibition of cell proliferation , measured by thymidine incorporation , was virtually identical for GR-wt , GR-LS7 and GR-NDel-expressing clones .
Dex concentrations of 10~° % M or higher , completely abrogated proliferation , whereas the responses were more gradual in the nanomolar range for each receptor type .
Although clonal variability was observed , no consistent differences were detected between clones expressing GR-wt , GR-LS7 or NDel .
The parental cells were insensitive to dex .
Scatchard analyses were performed for GR-wt , GR-LS7 and the parental cells to determine receptor numbers of individual clones ( Table I ) , using binding to whole cells as described previously ( Helmberg et al. , 1990 ) .
The observed receptor numbers ranged between 30 000 and 80 000 per cell and were somewhat higher than the 14 000 endogenous receptors found in the lymphoblastic leukemic CEM-C7 cell line ( Harbour et al. , 1990 ) , but lower than the 125 000 endogenous receptors in the P388D1 cell line ( Helmberg et al. , 1990 ) .
Clones with higher receptor numbers tended to be more sensitive to dex .
Receptors from all clones bound dex with virtually the same affinity ( K , = 3-5 nM ) .
No specific binding of dex was detected in parental cells .
Similar results were obtained by measuring the effect of dex on cell viability using trypan blue exclusion ( Figure 3A ) .
These assays revealed massive cell death in the presence of dex beginning after ~24 h. DNA fragmentation 454 1501 O 2 -J 2 1001 3 S 5 C 5 $ - s01 € C 1 `` | | 0 aan 1 1 I llI| llll IIII ll '' Alli 3 C - v +-®0 to to Ao $ % of on a § g a & 8 g % a E GR-wt GRLS7 Fig .

GR-mediated transactivation in parental and stably transfected Jurkat cells .
Parental GR~ Jurkat cells , three clones expressing GR-wt and five clones expressing GR-LS7 were transfected by electroporation with MMTV-LUC reporter , Cells were divided into five batches and treated for 16 h with either vehicle ( ethanol ) alone or 3X 10- ' % , 1x10~° , 3x 107° and 1078 M dex .
For each clone , the four bars indicate luciferase activity in dex treated wells divided by luciferase activity in the vehicle control .
by internucleosomal cleavage , a hallmark of apoptosis ( Wyllie , 1980 ) , was detected after a 40 h incubation with dex in GR-wt , GR-LS7 and GR-NDel-expressing clones , but not in the parental cells ( Figure 3B ) .
Attempts to block this effect of dex with cycloheximide or actinomycin D ( Cohen and Duke , 1984 ) , revealed that either agent induces DNA fragmentation by itself , as shown for other lymphoid cells ( Martin et al. , 1990 ; Bazar and Deeg , 1992 ) .
Induction of apoptosis was also confirmed by morphological criteria , such as cell shrinkage and breakdown of the cell into apoptotic bodies ( not shown ) .
Most importantly , the inhibition of cell proliferation and eventually cell killing did not correlate with transcriptional activation by the GR .
For example , GR-wt clone D1-1 ( 43 000 receptors/cell ) responds to 10~° M dex with a J 300 parental 200 1 100 1 viable cells ( x10 000 ) + hours 10 20 30 40 50 o 300 GBR-wt 200 1 100 1 viable cells ( x10 000 ) o _s o ho o t o $ & 0 50 300 GR-LS7 200 1 viable cells ( x10 000 ) 0 u u r T 30 40 50 hours le ] we o ho o hours Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis B parental _ GR-wt - GR-LS7 GR-NDel ssi FEH 7 N T origin » La 2000 i > « = » > cem » 1000 i > « « » » 500 b ” Fig .

40-fold activation of MMTV-LUC ( Figure 2 ) , but with litle inhibition of cell proliferation ( 81 % thymidine incorporation ) ( Table I ) and loss of viable cell count ( Figure 3A ) .
Conversely , GR-LS7 clone F6-1 ( 78 000 receptors/cell ) demonstrates only 3-fold activation of MMTV-LUC at 10-° M dex ( Figure 2 ) , but considerable inhibition of thymidine incorporation ( 23 % incorporation ) and loss of viable cell count ( Figure 3A ) .
To compare the activating and suppressive activities of the wt GR and the LS7 mutant on transcription of endogenous genes in our stably transfected clones , we chose glutamine synthase and IL-2 expression as indica-tors .
The glutamine synthase promoter contains a GRE and is glucocorticoid inducible ( Pu and Young , 1989 ) .
IL-2 induction is inhibited by glucocorticoids ( Gillis et al. , 1979 ; Arya et al. , 1984 ) , and the cis elements mediating this inhibition were identified ( Vacca et al. , 1990 ; Northrop et al. , 1992 ) .

Effects of dex on gene expression in parental , GR-wt and GR-LS7 Jurkat cells .
( A ) Cells were treated for 8 h ( IL-2 ) or 1 h ( c-jun , c-fos ) as indicated , total RNA was extracted and 20 jig per lane were separated on a 1 % agarose gel , transferred to a nylon membrane and analyzed by hybridization using probes specific for human IL-2 , c-jun , o-tubulin and murine c-fos .
( B ) Cells were grown for 3 h in the presence or absence of dex ( 107 % M ) , and RNA was extracted and analyzed with probes for human glutamine synthase ( Van den Hoff et al. , 1991 ) , c-myc and -tubulin .
Note that GR-LS7 clone C3-2 , which shows a small induction of glutamine synthase mRNA is also the clone with the highest residual transcriptional activity shown in Figure 2 , and that the two C3-2 lanes contain more RNA than the other lanes .
they do not bind GR , but are recognized by either AP-1 or NF-IL-2A , which is a complex between AP-1 and Octl ( Northrop et al. , 1992 ; Ullman et al. , 1993 ) .
The amount of IL-2 in supernatants of untreated , TPA/ionomycin-stimulated or TPA/ionomycin + dex-treated cells was quantitated by a bioassay ( Gillis et al. , 1978 ) .
Marked inhibition of IL-2 production by dex was observed in both GR-wt and GR-LS7 clones , but not in the parental cells ( data not shown ) .
We also analyzed IL-2 mRNA steady state levels after 8 h of stimulation to avoid non-specific effects due to cell killing .
Induction of IL-2 mRNA was strongly suppressed by dex in both GR-wt and GR-LS7 cells , but not in parental cells ( Figure 4A ) .
The same result was found when the cells were stimulated by CD3-crosslinking ( Weiss and Stobo , 1984 ) , instead of TPA/ ionomycin ( data not shown ) .
On the other hand , dex did not inhibit induction of c-jun or c-fos mRNAs by TPA and ionomycin ( Figure 4A ) .
This pattern is identical to that described previously for HeLa cells ( Jonat et al. , 1990 ; Yang-Yen et al. , 1990 ) .
Although the activated GR interferes with AP-1 activity , interference is not due to inhibition of jun and fos gene expression .
Recently , Thulasi et al .
( 1993 ) reported that glucocorticoid treatment of a leukemic cell line repressed c-myc expression .
We checked c-myc expression in our system and found that as early 456 as 90 min after dex application , c-myc was repressed in all of the GR-wt and GR-LS7-expressing clones but not in the parental GR~ Jurkat cells ( Figure 4B ) .
On the other hand , dex-mediated induction of the glutamine synthase gene , which is positively regulated by glucocorticoids , was observed only in wt GR-expressing clones and not in the parental GR~ cells or in LS7-expressing clones .
As a more comprehensive screen for the effects of GR-wt and GR-LS7 on expression of endogenous genes , we used differential mRNA display by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) as described by Liang and Pardee ( 1992 ) .
To exclude secondary effects on gene expression , parental GR~ , GR-wt and GR-LS7 cells were grown for 3 h in the presence of cycloheximide , with and without 10~8 M dex .
Total RNA was purified , reverse transcribed and the resulting cDNAs amplified and separated over a sequencing gel .
Whereas the vast majority of cDNAs appeared in equal abundance in all three clones , independently of hormone treatment , several examples of induced and repressed genes were detected ( Figure 5 ) .
The dex-induced cDNA species shown in the upper panel of Figure 5 was reproducibly detected several times and was consistently found to be induced only in GR-wt-expressing cells , but not in GR-LS7-expressing cells or in parental GR~ cells .

Global effects of dex on gene expression revealed by differential mRNA display .
Parental , GR-wt and GR-LS7 cells were grown for 3 h in the presence of cycloheximide , with and without 1078 M dex .
Total RNA was purified and reverse transcribed using anchored primers , followed by sets of PCRs using the anchored primer and different 10mers in the presence of [ *°S ] dATP .
The resulting amplified cDNAs were separated on a sequencing gel and and autoradiographed .
Due to the ragged ends of PCR products , copies from the same cDNA can differ in size by four to six nucleotides .
Shown are examples of one dex-inducible cDNA product which is induced only in wt-GR-expressing cells and one dex-repressible cDNA product that is repressed in both wt-GR and LS7-expressing cells .
ance was decreased following dex treatment were detected only in GR-wt and GR-LS7-expressing cells , but not in parental GR~ cells .
Only 15 randomly chosen primer combinations have been analyzed .
If the repressive function of the GR , exemplified by its interference with AP-1 activity , was necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis , this would predict that the same result should be obtained using another nuclear receptor having similar transcription interfering capabili-ties .
To test this hypothesis , we selected the RA receptor , RARa .
To activate transcription in a ligand-dependent manner , RARa binds to specific response elements , RAREs , that are different from GREs ( for a review , see Glass and Rosenfeld , 1991 ) .
However , like the GR , RARa interferes with AP-1 activity in a ligand-dependent fashion ( Schiile et al. , 1991 ; Yang-Yen et al. , 1991 ) .
This interference also does not require direct binding of RAR to DNA .
In many systems , RA induces cellular differentiation ( Ragsdale and Brockes , 1991 ) , whereas in a few instances it has been shown to induce cell death ( Alles and Sulik , 1990 ; Piacentini et al. , 1991 ) .
Since no RAR mRNA was detected in parental Jurkat cells , we established Jurkat cells expressing stably transfected RARa using a pRc/ Bact-RARa expression vector .
When exposed to 10~° M RA , cells from RARo-expressing clones died within 72 h , showing the typical internucleosomal DNA degradation pattern , whereas parental Jurkat cells did not ( Figure 6 ) .
Subsequently , we assayed the effect of RA on c-myc expression .

The lack of RA sensitivity of the parental cells suggests that they do not express functional RA receptor .
Discussion Since the classical mode of action of the ligand-activated GR is induction of gene transcription ( Yamamoto and Alberts , 1975 ) , it has been assumed for many years that T cell apoptosis is mediated by induction of 'lysis genes ' ( Gasson and Bourgeois , 1983 ) .
However , despite the isolation of two cDNAs for mRNAs whose expression correlates with induction of apoptosis ( Owens et al. , 1991 ) , no functional glucocorticoid-inducible 'lysis genes ' were identified .
The work described above casts serious doubts on the 'lysis-gene ' hypothesis and strongly suggests that an alternative mechanism is at par .
As we show , a variant 457 A.Helmberg et al .
GR that is severely compromised in its ability to activate GRE-mediated gene transcription ( Godowski et al. , 1989 ) , yet fully capable of interfering with AP-1 activity ( Yang-Yen et al. , 1990 ) , confers full glucocorticoid sensitivity when expressed at normal levels in GR-deficient Jurkat cells .
Analysis of five different cell clones expressing this mutant receptor , LS7 , indicates that they all undergo apoptosis in response to the same concentration of dex that induces lysis of clones expressing the wt GR , even though they exhibit highly compromised GRE-mediated gene induction , amounting to 5-10 % of wt activity .
Likewise , expression of RARa , which shares only its AP-1 interfering effect with the GR , was found to confer RA-mediated apoptosis on these cells .
These results strongly suggest that glucocorticoids are unlikely to cause apoptosis , at least in Jurkat cells , by direct induction of 'lysis genes ' .
A more plausible hypothesis consistent with our findings is that glucocorticoids induce apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of yet-to-be identified 'survival genes ' ( Raff , 1992 ) .
Previous mapping of GR domains required for lysis of the human lymphoblastic leukemia CEM-ICR 27 cell line suggested that only the DNA binding domain was sufficient and that none of the transcriptional activation domains was required ( Nazareth et al. , 1991 ) .
These results , however , are based on transient transfection of GR expression vectors and only a fraction of the cells are therefore susceptible to lysis under such conditions .
In addition , transient transfection usually results in vast overexpression of the relevant protein .
In direct contrast to this study , Dieken and Miesfeld ( 1992 ) , using stably transfected $ 49 mouse lymphoma cells , reported that the N-terminal activation domain of the GR is absolutely required for induction of apoptosis .
We find the mutant that lacks the N-terminal activation domain of the rat GR is , as expected , partially compromised in its ability to activate a GRE-dependent reporter gene , but has nearly normal AP-1 interfering activity .
When stably expressed in Jurkat cells this construct confers glucocorticoid inducible apoptosis as efficiently as the wt GR .
This discrepancy may be due to the use of a slightly larger N-terminal deletion by Dieken and Miesfeld ( 1992 ) , which may have attenuated the transcriptional interfering activity of the receptor in addition to its activation ability .
Some contribution of N-terminal sequences to transcriptional interference was previously reported ( Jonat et al. , 1990 ; Yeng-Yen et al. , 1990 ) .
Repression of potential 'survival genes ' is likely to be mediated through transcriptional interference between the activated GR and transcription factors such as AP-1 .
As we show here and previously ( Yang- Yen et al. , 1990 ) , the LS7 mutant is fully capable of interfering with AP-1 activity .
Furthermore , induction of IL-2 , an AP-1 target gene ( Serfling et al. , 1989 ; Jain et al. , 1992 ; Ullman et al. , 1993 ; Su et al. , 1994 ) , is fully susceptible to repression by dex in LS7-expressing clones .
c-myc expression , which as we show is repressed by liganded GR-wt , GR-LS7 and RARa , was suggested to be regulated by AP-1 ( Hay et al. , 1989 ) .
So far , our attempts to prove that AP-1 is the relevant target with whose function the activated GR interferes to induce T cell lysis have failed , due to the toxic effect of c-Jun or c-Fos overexpression on lymphoid cells ( A.Helmberg and N.Auphan , unpublished results ) .
458 Thus , it has not been possible to obtain glucocorticoid-resistant clones by overexpression of AP-1 constituents .
Although AP-1 is a reasonable candidate for regulating expression of 'survival genes ' , the activated GR can also interfere with the activity of other transcription factors , including octamer binding proteins ( Weiland et al. , 1991 ) .
Although IL-2-dependent cells undergo apoptosis in response to IL-2 withdrawal , we do not think that glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis can be reduced to IL-2 with-drawal .
Our Jurkat lines are not IL-2 dependent and do not transcribe the IL-2 gene unless activated ( Figure 4A ) .
Addition of recombinant IL-2 did not protect the cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis ( data not shown ) .
Could c-myc be a survival gene ?
Recently , Thulasi et al .
( 1993 ) reported that repression of c-myc correlated with induction of apoptosis by glucocorticoids in a human leukemic cell line and that transient transfection with c-myc expression vectors provided some protection against the lethal effects of glucocorticoids .
In our system , inhibition of c-myc expression preceded induction of apoptosis following activation of either GR-wt , GR-LS7 or RARa .
In an attempt to protect the cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis , we generated subclones of GR-wt-expressing cells that constitutively overexpressed c-myc mRNA after stable transfection with a c-Myc expression vector .
In response to dex , these clones still underwent apoptosis .
However , immunoblot analysis of the c-myc-overexpressing cells indicated that dex still downregulated c-myc expression , suggesting an additional level of interference with c-myc expression ( A.Helmberg , unpublished results ) .
We therefore can neither confirm nor exclude the requirement for repression of c-myc expression in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis .
c-mye downregulation in response to glucocorticoids or RA is not T-cell specific , since glucocorticoids reduce c-mye mRNA levels in C127 mouse fibroblasts ( O ' Benion et al. , 1992 ) and RA reduces c-myc mRNA-levels in HL-60 promyelocytic cells ( Kizaki et al. , 1993 ) without inducing apoptosis .
On the other hand , expression of c-myc in the absence of a mitogenic signal was shown to induce the apoptosis of rat-l fibroblasts ( Evan et al. , 1992 ) .
While the 'survival genes ' whose expression is inhibited by the activated GR remain to be identified , our work strongly suggests that interference with the expression of such genes is sufficient for induction of apoptosis .
We suggest that the function of such 'survival genes ' is cell cycle progression .
Glucocorticoids are known to lead to G| cell cycle arrest in human leukemic T-cells ( Harmon et al. , 1979 ) and many other cell types ( Goya et al. , 1993 ; Sanchez et al. , 1993 ) .
AP-1 has been reported to be required for cell cycle progression ( Kovary and Bravo , 1991 ) , and c-myc expression has been shown to be necessary for S to G , /M transition in the lymphoid BAF-BO3 cell line ( Shibuya et al. , 1992 ) .
Likely , the derangement of these parameters caused by glucocorticoid action can not be made up for by constitutive overexpression of a single proto-oncogene .
Yet , it is possible that by interfering with normal cell cycle progression , glucocorticoids or any other agent having the same effect , such as RA , may trigger a default pathway resulting in activation of the constitutively expressed , but inactive , nuclease that causes the internucleosomal cleavage of chromatin .
Other processes involved in programmed cell death are likely to be activated through the same pathway .
Materials and methods Cell culture Normal Jurkat cells and TAg Jurkat cells ( Clipstone and Crabtree , 1992 ) were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal calf serum , 10 mM HEPES and 50 uM B-mercaptoethanol .
Plasmids The expression vector for stable transfection , pRe/Bact , was constructed by exchanging the Nrul- HindIII fragment containing the CMV promoter of pRe/CMV ( InVitrogen , La Jolla , CA ) with the 1.3 kb HindIII fragment of pAGS ( Miyazaka er al. , 1989 ) .
The Xbal fragments containing the full length coding sequences of either GR-wt or GR-LS7 were subcloned from p6R ( Godowski er al. , 1989 ) into pRe/CMV , followed by ligating the large Pvul-Notl fragment of the resultant plasmids , containing the cDNA , to the small Pvul-Notl fragment of pRe/Bact , containing the B actin promoter , to generate the expression vectors pRe/Bact-GR-wt and pRe/Bact-GR-LS7 .
pRe/Bact-GR-NDel was derived from pRC/Bact-GR-wt by deletion of the 1050 bp HindIII fragment containing the 324 N-terminal codons .
This eliminates the N-terminal activation domain located at codons 77-262 ( Hollenberg and Evans , 1988 ) .
Translation of this mutant probably starts at Met336 .
pRe/ Bact-RARa was constructed by subcloning the cDNA encoding human RARa ( Glass ert al. , 1989 ) into the HindIII and Nof !
sites of pRe/Bact .
The reporter plasmids used were a MMTV-LUC reporter containing two consensus GREs ( Drouin ert al. , 1993 ) and the AP-1-dependent -73Col-LUC ( Deng and Karin , 1993 ) derived from the human collagenase promoter ( Angel et al. , 1987 ) .
Isolation of stable transfectants 10 '' Jurkat cells in 0.5 ml of fresh medium were electroporated at 960 uFD , 280 V with 20 ug of Pvul-linearized pRe/Bact-GR-wt , pRe/ Bact-GR-LS7 , pRe/Bact-NDel or pRe/Bact-RARa , respectively .
Subsequently , the cells were aliquotted into 96-well plates and , beginning with the next day , kept at 1.5 mg/ml G418 ( 60 % active compound ) .
G418-resistant clones developed that were replicated and examined by thymidine incorporation assays in the presence and absence of 10~° M dex or RA .
Some of the clones demonstrating glucocorticoid-dependent inhibition of thymidine incorporation were recloned by limiting dilution .
Northern analysis of the resulting clones revealed high expression levels of the transfected GR or RARa that were not influenced by cell treatment with TPA/ionomycin or dex ( not shown ) .
No endogenous GR or RARa message was detected .
Transient transfections Logarithmically growing cells were centrifuged , resuspended in fresh medium at 10 '' /0.5 ml , electroporated at 960 uF , 320 V with 10 ug of reporter plasmid and , in the cases of TAg Jurkat cells , with 5 ug of expression vector .
Electroporated cells were then diluted to 10 ml with fresh medium .
Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein concentration of extracts .
Thymidine incorporation assays Approximately 1.25 % 10° cells/ml were seeded in microtiter plates and grown for 42 h in the absence or presence of dex , followed by addition of methyl- [ 3H1thymidine ( Amersham , 5 Ci/mmol ! )
to a final activity of 4 pCi/ml for an additional 8 h. Subsequently , cells were harvested and counted .
DNA fragmentation assay After having been grown for 24 or 48 h in the presence or absence of the appropriate hormone , ~2X 10° cells were lysed in 400 ul of DNA isolation buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 , 100 mM NaCl , 25 mM EDTA , 0.5 % SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K ) .
After overnight incubation at 37°C , DNA was ethanol precipitated , resuspended in 400 pil of TE buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 1 mM EDTA ) containing 10 mg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by chloroform , and ethanol precipitated .
DNA was resuspended in TE buffer and quantified .
Equal amounts of DNA were either directly resolved on a 2 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide or first end-labeled using terminal transferase and [ & -P ] ddATP as described ( Tilly et al. , 1993 ) .
In the Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis latter case , the gel was dried under vacuum at room temperature and autoradiographed .
Differential mRNA display This was done using total cellular RNA exactly as described by Liang and Pardee ( 1992 ) .
