3 Transcription Mediated by NFAT Is Highly Inducible in Effector CD4* T Helper 2 ( Th2 ) Cells but Not in Th1 Cells MERCEDES RINCON ' f anp RICHARD A. FLAVELL'* Section of Immunobiology , Yale University School of Medicine , and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , '' New Haven , Connecticut 06510 Received 9 September 1996/Returned for modification 29 October 1996/Accepted 19 December 1996 Transcriptional factors of the NFAT family play an important role in regulating the expression of several cytokine genes during the immune response , such as the genes for interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-4 , among others .
Upon antigen stimulation , precursor CD4* T helper ( pTh ) cells proliferate and differentiate into two populations of effector cells ( eTh1 and eTh2 ) , each one expressing a specific pattern of cytokines that distinguishes them from their precursors .
eTh2 cells are the major source of IL-4 , while gamma interferon is produced by eTh1 cells .
Here we have used reporter transgenic mice to show that DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFAT are transiently induced during the differentiation of pTh cells into either eTh1 or eTh2 cells to mediate the expression of IL-2 as a common growth factor in both pathways .
However , although NFAT DNA binding is similarly induced in both eTh1 and eTh2 cells upon antigen stimulation , only the NFAT complexes present in eTh2 cells are able to mediate high-level transcription , and relatively little NFAT transcriptional activity was induced in eTh1 cells .
In contrast to activated pTh cells , neither eTh1 nor eTh2 cells produced significant IL-2 upon stimulation , but the high levels of NFAT transcriptional activities directly correlate with the IL-4 production induced in response to antigen stimulation in eTh2 cells .
These data suggest that activated NFAT is involved in the effector function of eTh2 cells and that the failure of eTh1 cells to produce IL-4 in response to an antigen is due , at least partially , to a failure to induce high-level transcription of the IL-4 gene by NFAT .
Regulation of NFAT could be therefore a critical element in the polarization to eThl or eTh2 .
The nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) was originally described as a T-cell-specific transcriptional factor which was expressed in activated but not resting T cells and was required for interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene transcription ( 13 , 58 , 59 ) .
However , we now know that NFAT is not T cell specific but is also induced in a variety of lymphoid cells and probably in nonlymphoid tissues ( see below ) .
In T cells , the NFAT complex consists of two components : a preexisting cytoplasmic component and a nuclear component , which is synthesized de novo upon activation ( 16 ) .
The ubiquitous nuclear component contains members of the Fos and Jun protein families ( 4 , 27 , 44 ) .
The cytoplasmic component was described to be a constitutive T-cell-specific protein , NFATp or NFATce .
More re-cently , the identification of the genes that encode the cytoplasmic component has shown that NFAT is not a unique protein but is a family of transcription factors which are differentially distributed in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells .
NFATp and NFAT are highly homologous and are present mainly in lymphoid tissues ( 38 , 43 ) .
However , while NFATe is expressed in T cells only upon activation , NFATp is already expressed in unstimulated cells .
In contrast , NFAT3 expression is present at low levels in spleen and thymus , but it is highly expressed in nonlymphoid tissues ( placenta , kidney , lung , testis , and ovary ) ( 23 ) .
The expression of NFATA4/NFAT ' x is , however , more restricted to the thymus ( 21 , 23 , 37 ) .
The activation of NFAT requires both protein kinase C ( PKC ) and Ca** signals .
Activators of PKC , such as the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , induce the synthesis of the nuclear component ( 4 , 16 , 27 , 43 ) .

1522 an increase in intracellular calcium is required for the translocation of the cytoplasmic component to the nucleus .
This translocation is mediated by the Ca**-dependent phosphatase calcineurin , which is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine ( CsA ) and FK506 ( 10 , 14 , 16 , 26 , 45 ; for a review see reference 56 ) .
Induction of NFAT in precursor T cells directly correlates with the expression of the IL-2 gene upon T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -mediated activation .
However , NFAT activity can also be detected in conditions where the IL-2 gene is not expressed .
Thus , NFAT DNA binding is induced in B cells by the ligation of surface immunoglobulins or CD40 receptors , which trigger Ca**-dependent and CsA-sensitive pathways ( 8 , 66 ) , but not by lipopolysaccharide .
In addition , stimulation of natural killer ( NK ) cells by CD16 ligands induces NFAT DNA binding activity in a CsA-sensitive manner ( 2 ) .
This wide distribution of NFAT indicates that NFAT has additional targets beyond the IL-2 promoter .
In fact , specific NFAT -binding sites have been identified in the promoters of several cytokines , such as IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) , and granulo-cyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , where it may cooperate with other transcriptional factors , such as AP-1 ( 49 ) .
The expression of NFAT may therefore correlate with the expression of specific cytokines , independently of the cell type .
Recognition of specific major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes on antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) via the TCR complex provides the first signal required for activation of naive ( precursor ) CD4 * T cells .
The second , costimulatory signal is provided by accessory molecules expressed on APC ( 41 ) , of which the B7 family of proteins is the most widely studied .
The B7 proteins are the ligands for CD28 or CTLA-4 which are expressed on T cells ( 3 , 17 , 18 , 35 , 36 ) .
The combination of these two signals induces IL-2 synthesis and secre-tion , IL-2 receptor expression , clonal expansion , and differentiation of precursor T helper ( pTh ) cells into effector T helper Vor .
17 , 1997 ( eTh ) cells .
Two subsets of eTh cells have been defined on the basis of their distinct cytokine secretion patterns and their immunomodulatory effects ( 40 , 46 ) .
eTh1 cells produce inflammatory cytokines , such as TNF- and gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) , and enhance cellular immunity mediated by macrophages .
In contrast , eTh2 cells produce a different group of cytokines ( IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-10 , and IL-13 ) and help B cells secrete antibodies .
The differentiation of precursor T cells into eThl1 or eTh2 cells has important biologic implications in terms of susceptibility or resistance to a particular disease .
Different factors have been reported to influence differentiation to the eTh1 or eTh2 phenotype , such as the antigen dose ( 5 , 11 , 48 ) or the source of costimulation ( 31 , 34 ) .
However , the most effective inducer of such differentiation is the cytokine envi-ronment .
Thus , IL-4 in conjunction with the antigenic and costimulatory signals causes pTh cells to differentiate into eTh2 cells ( 33 , 61 ) , while IL-12 drives pTh cells to differentiate into eTh1 cells ( 25 , 57 ) .
The molecular basis for the distinction between eTh1l and eTh2 cells is unknown .
Nevertheless , transcriptional differences may account for the specific effector functions ( expres-sion of specific cytokines ) acquired by each of the eTh subsets .
Identification of the specific transcriptional factors activated in these cell types is therefore required to achieve an understanding of the properties of these cells .
Because NFAT is involved in the regulation of certain cytokines , it is a likely candidate to be differentially expressed in eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
This question has been addressed previously by analyzing NFAT activity in Th1 and Th2 clones ( 53 , 54 ) , and in those studies no differences were found between both kind of clones .
However , not much is known about the regulation of NFAT during the differentiation of pTh cells into eTh1 or eTh2 cells .
Here , we have analyzed the regulation of NFAT activity during the activation of mouse pTh cells , the differentiation of naive CD4 * cells into eTh1 or eTh2 cells , and the activation of these eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
The ability of one particular transcription factor to bind DNA does not always correlate with the ability to mediate transcription .
Thus , several transcriptional factors ( cyclic AMP -responsive element binding protein [ CREB ] , STAT-1 and -3 , and AP-1 , etc . )
require an additional postranslational modification of the DNA-bound complex to mediate transcription ( 20 , 51 ) .
We therefore used NFAT-luciferase ( NFAT-Luc ) reporter transgenic mice , which we have previously described ( 52 ) , to examine NFAT transcriptional activity during T-cell differentiation .
In this report , we demonstrate that NFAT transcriptional activity is regulated similarly during the differentiation of pTh cells into eTh1 cells and into eTh2 cells .
However , NFAT transcriptional activity is rapidly induced at high levels upon stimulation of eTh2 cells , while only low levels are detected upon stimulation of eTh1 cells .
In contrast , only small differences in NFAT DNA binding were observed , and NFAT complexes in both eTh1 and eTh2 contain NFAT p and NFATe .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice .
The NFAT-Luc reporter transgenic mice have been generated by mi-croinjection of the 2.8-kb BamHI DNA fragment into fertilized ( C57BL/6 x SJIL ) F , eggs , as previously described ( 24 ) .
The NFAT-Luc transgene contains the firefly luciferase gene driven by a 200-bp fragment of the IL-2 minimal promoter ( -326 to -294 and -72 to +47 ) with three NFAT-binding sites inserted in an Xhol site between these fragments ( 13 , 67 ) .
Three expressing positive founder lines were established and backcrossed onto B10.BR/SGSNJ mice ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , Maine ) to obtain progeny for these studies .
All three lines display the same pattern but different levels of luciferase expression .
Most experiments were performed with transgenic mice from line 83 , with the exception of the indicated experiments .
The cytochrome c ( Cyt c ) TCR transgenic mice were kindly provided by S. M. Hedrick and J. Kaye ( 30 ) .
NFAT TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY IN CD4+* Th2 CELLS | 1523 Cell preparations .
T cells were purified from lymph nodes from NFAT-Luc transgenic mice by negative selection ( 51 ) , by using anti-major histocompatibility complex class II I-E/I-A monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) ( m5/115 ) .
B cells were purified from spleen from NFAT-Luc transgenic mice , by negative selection , by incubation with anti-CD4 ( GK1.5 ) , anti-CD8 ( TTB 105 ) , and anti-NK ( NK1.1 ; Pharmingen ) prior the treatment with rabbit complement for 45 min at 37°C .
CD4 * T cells were isolated from spleen and lymph nodes from double transgenic ( Cyt c TCR x NFAT-Luc ) mice by negative selection ( 29 , 51 ) and cultured ( 10° cells/ml ) in the presence of APC ( 5 X 10° cell/ml ) , with concanavalin A ( ConA ) ( 2.5 ug/ml ) ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) or Cyt c peptide ( 5 g/m ! )
plus IL-4 ( 10° U/ml ) or IL-12 ( 3.5 ng/ml ) .
After 4 days , cells were exhaustively washed and restimulated ( eTh cells ) .
APC were generated from B10.BR splenocytes by treatment with mitomycin ( 50 g/m ! )
( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo . )
for 45 min .
1-Ethyl-3- ( 3-dimethylaminopro-pyl ) -carbodimide ( ECDI ) -fixed APC were obtained by fixation of B10.BR splenocytes with ECDI ( 75 mM ) ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , Calif. ) for 1 h at 4°C ( 28 ) .
Luciferase activity .
Luciferase activity in the cell extracts was measured ( 51 ) with a luciferase assay kit ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
The relative luciferase activity compared with that found in extracts from unstimulated cells is pre-sented .
Nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
`` Mini '' nuclear extracts were obtained from 2 X 10° to 3 X 10° cells by a previously described procedure ( 55 , 65 ) .
Binding reactions were done using 1.5 pg of nuclear protein in the presence of 5 X 10* cpm of the specific *°P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide for 25 min at 4°C as previously described ( 55 , 65 ) .
The oligonucleotides that have been used in this study are as follows : IL2-NFAT , 5'GCCCAAAGAGGAAAATITGTITCATACAG3 ' ( 27 ) ; II4-NFAT ( -60 to -83 ) 5GTAATAAAATTITTCCAATGTAAA3 ' ( 53 ) ; long IIL A-NFAT ( -60 to -91 ) ( 54 ) ; AP-1 ( 1 , 32 ) ; and CRE , 5'GATCT CTCTGACGTCAGCCAAGGAGGAGGCC3 ' ( 39 ) .
Cytokine production .
IL-4 and IFN-y secretion was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified ( 3 pg/ml ) and biotinylated ( 1 pg/ml ! )
anti-IL-4 or anti-IFN-y MAbs ( Pharmingen , San Diego , Calif. ) , horseradish peroxi-dase-conjugated avidin D ( 2.5 g/m ! )
( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , Calif. ) , and the TMB microwell peroxidase substrate and stop solution ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories , Gaithersburg , Md . ) .
Recombinant IL-4 ( DNAX , Los Ange-les , Calif. ) and IFN-y ( Gibco BRL , Gaithersburg , Md . )
were used as standards .
IL-2 production was analyzed by using the CTL.L line as previously described ( 19 ) .
Reagents and antisera .
In the T-cell activation and differentiation studies , we have used ConA ( Boehringer ) , anti-CD3 MAb ( 145-2C11 ) , PMA ( Sigma ) , ionomycin ( Sigma ) , synthetic moth Cyt c peptide ( kindly provided by K. Bottomly , Yale University ) , IL-4 ( kindly provided by DNAX ) , IL-12 ( kindly provided by Genetics Institute ) , and CTLA4-Ig ( kindly provided by P. Linsley ) .

Anti-NFATc and anti-NFATp ' were kindly provided by G. Crabtree .
RESULTS Generation of NFAT reporter transgenic mice .
To study the regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity during activation and differentiation of mouse primary T cells , we generated luciferase reporter transgenic mice for NFAT ( NFAT-Luc ) .
We microinjected the firefly luciferase gene driven by three NFAT binding sites ( 13 , 67 ) in the context of the IL-2 minimal promoter .
This construct has been previously used to generate reporter transgenic mice by using the simian virus 40 large T antigen as a reporter gene ( 67 ) .
The luciferase activity is the readout system for the ability of endogenous NFAT to mediate specific transcription .
Three different expressing founders containing the luciferase gene were identified , and they were backcrossed to produce stable lines of transgenic mice .
To determine the luciferase expression in these transgenic mice , we stimulated total spleen cells for different times with PMA ( a PKC activator ) plus ionomycin ( calcium ionophore ) , and luciferase activity was analyzed as described previously ( 51 ) .
Although no luciferase expression was detected in unstimulated cells ( data not shown ) , significant luciferase activity was observed in cells from transgenic mice from lines 83 , 91 , and 110 upon stimulation ( Fig .
1A ) .
NFAT transcriptional activity was therefore inducible with PMA and ionomycin in primary spleen cells , in correlation with the induction of NFAT DNA binding ( 67 ) .
Analysis by reverse transcriptase PCR has shown 1524 RINCON AND FLAVELL Mor .

Generation and characterization of the NFAT reporter transgenic mice .
( A ) NFAT transcriptional activity in activated splenocytes .
Spleen cells ( 5 x 10° ) from different lines of reporter transgenic mice ( 83 , 91 , and 110 ) were stimulated with PMA ( 5 ng/m ! )
plus ionomycin ( 250 ng/ml ) for the indicated times .
Cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity .
( B ) NFAT transcriptional activity in T and B cells .
T cells ( 5 x 10° ) from lymph nodes and B cells ( 5 x 10° ) from spleens of transgenic mice ( founder line 83 ) were purified by negative selection , as described in Materials and Methods , and activated with PMA and ionomycin .
After different periods of time , luciferase activity was analyzed .
( C ) Ca** requirement for NFAT transcriptional activity .
Spleen cells ( 5 x 10° ) were treated with PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( Ion ) ( 250 or 500 ng/ml ) , or PMA ( 5 ng/m ! )
plus ionomycin ( 250 or 500 ng/m ! )
( P/T ) for the times indicated before harvesting for luciferase activity analysis .
that the luciferase transcripts initiate around the predicted 5 ' end for these promoters and that there is no significant level of readthrough from any other endogenous promoter in the vicinity of the integration site of the transgene ( data not shown ) .
NFAT was originally described as an inducible T-cell-specific DNA-binding protein required for the expression of IL-2 in activated T cells ( 13 , 58 , 59 ) .
However , we and others have previously demonstrated that NFAT DNA binding and transcriptional activity are also induced in thymocytes after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin ( 7 , 52 ) .
In addition , NFAT DNA binding is also induced in B cells ( 8 , 66 , 67 , 69 ) , but whether this NFAT is able to mediate transcription in normal B cells remains controversial .
We examined NFAT transcriptional activity in isolated T and B cells , therefore , to discriminate which population is responsible for the activity detected in activated splenocytes .
NFAT transcriptional activity was induced in both T and B cells after treatment with PMA plus ionomycin for different periods of time ( Fig .
1B ) .
However , while in T cells NFAT activity gradually increased with time , in B cells it was induced more rapidly and decayed after 36 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
In addition , the same dose of PMA in combination with a higher dose of ionomycin ( 500 ng/ml ) resulted in a further increase of NFAT transcriptional activity in B cells ( 10 times greater than the activity observed with the lower dose of iono- Vor .
17 , 1997 mycin ) but did not modify the activity in T cells ( data not shown ) .
The induction of NFAT DNA binding requires both PKC and Ca** signals to trigger the synthesis of the nuclear component and translocation of the cytoplasmic component to the nucleus , respectively ( 16 ) .
In correlation with these obser-vations , neither PMA alone nor ionomycin alone was sufficient to stimulate NFAT transcriptional activity , but it was induced after treatment with PMA in combination of ionomycin ( Fig .
1C ) .
These data support the idea that NFAT mediates transcription not only in T cells but also in B cells .
Costimulation requirement for NFAT transcriptional activity in precursor T cells .
To examine the regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity by TCR-mediated signals , we stimulated total spleen cells with anti-CD3 MAb in different transgenic mouse lines .
Anti-CD3 MAb was also able to transiently induce high levels of NFAT transcriptional activity in T cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
The expression levels in the different lines of transgenic mice correlated with the level obtained after PMA-plus-ionomycin treatment .
In addition to the Ca** and PKC signals delivered by the TCR , activation of naive T cells requires a second , antigen-independent costimulatory signal , which is provided by the APC ( 41 ) .
The interaction of B7-1 and B7-2 molecules expressed on APC with their receptors ( CD28 or CTLA-4 ) expressed on T cells is the best-characterized source of costimulation ( 3 , 17 , 18 , 35 , 36 ) .
The mechanism by which costimulatory molecules regulate IL-2 gene expression is not completely understood yet .
We and others ( 51 , 60 ) have described that costimulation is required to induce AP-1 transcriptional activity in T cells .
In order to elucidate the role of costimulation in the transactivation function of NFAT , we examined NFAT transcriptional activity during the activation of precursor ( naive ) T cells .
We used « /B TCR transgenic mice ( Cyt c TCR ) which express a receptor specific for a peptide from pigeon Cyt c in association with I-E '' major histocompatibility complex II ( 30 ) .
These mice were crossed with NFAT-Luc reporter transgenic mice .
CD4 * pTh cells , which express mainly a naive phenotype ( approximately 95 % CD4SR '' s '' CD44 '' ) , from double transgenic mice ( Cyt c TCR X NFAT-Luc ) were purified and stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 MAb .
In the presence of APC , anti-CD3 MAb induced NFAT transcriptional activity in pTh cells .
When APC have been previously fixed ( by using ECDI , they are able to efficiently present antigen and mediate anti-CD3 MAb cross-linking but can not provide the costimulatory signal ( 28 ) .
In the presence of fixed APC , anti-CD3 MAb failed to induce NFAT transcriptional activity ( Fig .
2B ) .
Moreover , soluble CTLA4-Ig ( which blocks the CD28/CTLA4 pathway by binding both B7-1 and B7-2 molecules ) also blocked NFAT transcriptional activity induced by anti-CD3 MAb in the presence of APC .
Although immobilized anti-CD3 MAb is a strong stimulus which mimics the TCR cross-linking caused by the APC and it is able to deliver both PKC and Ca** signals , a second signal provided by APC was also required for NFAT transcriptional activity to be induced ( Fig .
2B ) .
Together these data provide evidence that the regulation of the IL-2 promoter by NFAT in pTh cells is dependent on costimulation .
Regulation of NFAT during the differentiation of precursor CD4* T cells into effector CD4* T cells .
To examine the regulation of NFAT during the differentiation of CD4 * pTh cells into CD4* eTh cells , we used an established procedure ( 29 ) in which precursor CD4* T cells purified from double transgenic mice ( Cyt c TCR X NFAT -luc ) were incubated with either the polyclonal stimulator ConA or specific Cyt c peptide together with exogenous APC for 4 days ( Fig .
3A ) .
Addition of IL-4 to the culture drives the differentiation of pTh cells into cells with the eTh2 phenotype ( 33 , 61 ) , while the presence of NFAT TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY IN CD4+* Th2 CELLS | 1525 IL-12 directs the differentiation of pTh cells to eTh1 cells ( 25 , 57 ) .
We first examined the regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity during the differentiation of pTh cells to eTh cells .
NFAT transcriptional activity was induced similarly during the differentiation of pTh cells into either eTh2 cells ( in the presence of IL-4 ) or eTh1 cells ( in the presence of IL-12 ) by ConA ( Fig .
3B ) or peptide ( Fig .
3C ) stimulation .
The kinetics of NFAT transcriptional activity induced by peptide stimulation ( peak at day 2 ) seemed , however , to be faster than the kinetics observed with ConA stimulation ( peak at day 3 ) .
With both stimuli , however , the NFAT transcriptional activity decayed to low levels by day 4 , at which time eTh cells have developed ( Fig .
3A ) .
Nevertheless , no significant differences were observed between the regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity during the course of differentiation in the presence of IL-4 or IL-12 ( Fig .
3B and C ) .
We also examined NFAT DNA binding during the differentiation of eTh1 and eTh2 cells by EMSA using extract from CD4* pTh cells stimulated with ConA in the presence of IL-4 or IL-12 for different periods of time .
DNA binding was rapidly induced after activation and decreased with time ( Fig .
3D ) .
Little difference in NFAT DNA binding was detected during the differentiation of pTh cells to eTh2 or eTh1 cells in the presence of either IL-4 or IL-12 , respectively .
After 4 days , low but significant levels of NFAT complexes remained present in eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
Together , these data indicated that both NFAT DNA binding and transcriptional activities were regulated similarly during the differentiation of pTh cells into eTh1 or eTh2 cells .
NFAT transcriptional activity is induced in activated eTh2 cells but not in eTh1 cells .
The ability to express and secrete specific cytokines upon activation is the principal characteristic that defines the two subsets of effector CD4 * T cells .
While activated eTh2 cells produce mainly IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-10 , and IL-13 , stimulation of eTh1 cells results in the secretion of IFN-y , TNF-B , and IL-2 , suggesting the differential distribution of transcription factors involved in the expression of those cytokines ( 40 , 46 ) .
Since NFAT binding sites have been identified in the promoter region of several cytokines ( 49 ) , such as IL-4 , we examined the regulation of this transcriptional factor during the activation of eThl and eTh2 cells .
We first confirmed the specificity of the system whereby pTh cells differentiated to either the eTh1 or eTh2 phenotype , by analyzing the effector molecules that were expressed after stimulation .
IL-4 production was detected only in eTh2 and not eTh1 cells upon stimulation with either ConA or Cyt c peptide ( Fig .
4A ) .
In contrast , IFN-y was secreted by stimulated eTh1 but not eTh2 cells ( Fig .
4A ) .
We next examined the regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity during the activation of eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
After 4 days of differentiation with ConA in the presence of IL-4 or IL-12 , effector cells were exhaustively washed and activated with different stimuli .
Interestingly , extremely high levels of NFAT transcriptional activity were induced in eTh2 cells upon stimulation with ConA or immobilized anti-CD3 MAb ( Fig .
4B ) .
NFAT transcriptional activity was detected in eTh1 cells upon stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 MAb , although it was 10- to 15-fold less than the NFAT activity of eTh2 cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
This residual NFAT transcriptional activity observed in eTh1 cells correlated with the low but detectable production of IL-2 and IL-4 by these cells ( data not shown ) , possibly due in part to the strong stimulus triggered by anti-CD3 MAb .
NFAT transcriptional activity was not induced by PMA alone or ionomycin alone , indicating that , in effector cells , NFAT also required both PKC and Ca** signals .
AP-1 transcriptional activity , however , was induced by PMA alone in effector T cells 1526 RINCON AND FLAVELL Mor .

Costimulation requirement for NFAT transcriptional activity in precursor T cells .
( A ) Total spleen cells ( 5 X 10° ) from different lines of NFAT-Lue transgenic mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 MAb ( 1 pg/ml ) for the indicated times before assay for luciferase activity .
( B ) CD4 * T cells ( 5 X 10° ) from Cyt c TCR x NFAT-Luc double transgenic mice were purified as described in Materials and Methods and stimulated with ( i ) soluble anti-CD3 MAb ( 1 pg/ml ) and normal APC ( APC ) or ECDI-fixed APC ( ECDI-APC ) in the absence ( - ) or the presence ( sCTLA4Ig ) of soluble CTLA4-Ig ( 10 pg/m ! )
or ( ii ) immobilized anti-CD3 MAb ( 5 pg/ml ) in the absence ( - ) or the presence ( APC ) of normal APC .

To establish the specificity of the NFAT induction in eTh2 cells , we analyzed the regulation of NFAT activity by specific antigen .
Thus , Cyt c peptide also induced high levels of NFAT transcriptional activity in eTh2 cells , which had developed in the presence of peptide and IL-4 with Cyt c peptide .
Peptide restimulation , however , triggered little transcription mediated by NFAT in eTh1 cells differentiated in the presence of peptide and IL-12 ( Fig .

Regulation of NFAT activity during differentiation of eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
( A ) Precursor CD4* T cells ( pTh ) from Cyt c TCR X NFAT-Lue double transgenic mice were differentiated , with ConA ( 2.5 pg/ml ) or Cyt c peptide ( pept ) ( 5 g/m ! )
and APC , into eTh2 cells in the presence of IL-4 ( 10° U/m ) or into eTh2 cells in the presence of IL-12 ( 3.5 ng/m ! ) .
After 4 days of differenti-ation , the cells were exhaustively washed and restimulated with different stimuli before harvest and analysis for cytokine production , NFAT transcriptional activity , and NFAT DNA binding .

pTh cells ( 5 x 10° ) were stimulated with ConA ( B ) or Cyt c peptide ( C ) in the presence of IL-4 or IL-12 , as described for panel A. Luciferase activity was analyzed after different periods of activation .
( D ) NFAT DNA binding during the differentiation of pTh cells into eTh cells .
pTh cells not stimulated ( - ) or stimulated with ConA and APC in the presence of IL-4 or IL-12 were harvested after the indicated times .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA using an oligonucleotide containing the distal NFAT binding site from the IL-2 promoter ( IL2-NFAT ) .
eTh1 cells relative to that in eTh2 cells were also observed after 24 h of stimulation ( Fig .
4B and C ) , indicating that the lack of NFAT activity induced in eTh1 cells was not caused by delayed kinetics .
Taken together , our data indicate that NFAT can mediate transcription in eTh2 cells but to a much lesser extent in eTh1 cells .
Since studies based on Th1 and Th2 clones indicate that IL-2 is a Thli-type cytokine , our data seemed at first sight to be counterintuitive because they suggested that NFAT was not 1528 RINCON AND FLAVELL Mor .

However , analysis of IL-2 production showed that only low levels of IL-2 were produced in either eTh2 or eTh1 cells stimulated with ConA or with Cyt c peptide , while high levels of IL-2 were detected in pTh cells 24 h after stimulation with ConA and significant levels were found after stimulation with peptide ( Fig .
4D ) .
Thus , IL-2 was equally expressed during the activation of pTh cells in the presence of either IL-4 or IL-12 , but it was not expressed significantly in activated eTh1 cells .
The lack of detectable IL-2 in eTh1 cells was not due to the consumption of IL-2 by the eTh1 cells , because very low IL-2 mRNA levels were detected in eTh1 cells compared to those induced in pTh cells ( 41a ) .
In contrast to the costimulation that was required to induce NFAT activity in pTh cells ( see above ) , ConA or immobilized anti-CD3 MAb alone , in the absence of APC , was able to stimulate NFAT transcriptional activity in eTh2 cells , showing that this second signal was not required in effector cells .
Activation of Th1 cells has been described to be more dependent on costimulation than the activation of Th2 cells .

Characterization of the nature of NFAT complexes in ConA-differentiated eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
( A ) Nuclear extracts from eTh1 and eTh2 cells not stimulated ( - ) or stimulated with ConA ( 2.5 pg/ml ) for 3 h were analyzed by EMSA by using an IL2-NFAT oligonucleotide ( NFAT ) or a CRE oligonucleotide ( CREB ) as a probe .
( B ) Nuclear extracts from eTh1 and eTh2 cells stimulated with ConA for 3 h were analyzed with an IL2-NFAT oligonucleotide as a probe .
Binding reactions were performed in the presence of anti-glutathione S-transferase ( - ) ( 1 p ) ( as a negative control ) , anti-NFATp ( 0.2 pl ) , or anti-NFATc ( 1.5 pl ) antisera .
( C ) Nuclear extracts from unstimulated or ConA-stimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cells were analyzed by using an NFAT binding site ( -60 to -83 ) sequence of the IL-4 promoter ( ILA-NFAT oligonucleotide ) as a probe .
Binding reactions were carried out in the presence of the antisera described for panel B or an anti-NFATp antiserum from an alternative source ( NFATp ' ) ( 1 pl ) .
fore possible that this caused the lack of NFAT transcriptional activity that we observed in eTh1 cells .
However , the presence of APC during ConA stimulation did not increase NFAT transcriptional activity in eTh1 cells , nor did it modify the activity of eTh2 cells ( Fig .
4E ) .
Similar cytoplasmic components of NFAT complexes in activated eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
To determine whether the lack of NFAT transcriptional activity in eThl cells was due to the absence of NFAT complexes in the nucleus , we examined NFAT DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from unstimulated or stimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
We quantitated the levels of NFAT complexes using densitometry and comparison to CREB controls in the same extracts .
Although low levels of NFAT were already present in the nuclei of unstimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cells , after stimulation with ConA upregulation occurred to similar levels in both eTh1 and eTh2 cells ( Fig .
5A ) .
As a control for extraction procedures and to exclude prote-olysis , we analyzed the DNA binding for the CREB protein ( Fig .
SA ) .
In some of the experiments we observed a slightly lower ( 1.5- to 2-fold ) NFAT DNA binding activity in stimulated eTh1 cells .
Although such a small difference could explain the large difference in NFAT activity between Th1 and Th2 cells ( 15 ) , we think it is equally or more likely that secondary modification of NFAT or an associated factor can ex plain these data .
These results suggested that nuclear NFAT complexes were present and could bind DNA but could not mediate transcription in eTh1 cells .
Different members of the NFAT family have been identified ( 21 , 23 , 37 , 38 , 43 ) , but the function and the relevance of each one of these members in the transcriptional activity mediated by specific NFAT regulatory elements are not clear .
Different compositions of the NFAT complexes detected in eTh1 and eTh2 cells could in principle account for the differences in the transcriptional activity .
We therefore analyzed the nature of the NFAT complexes in these cells .
It has been previously found that NFAT 3 is expressed , at the level of RNA , principally in nonlymphoid tissues , while the highest levels of expression of NFAT 4 are detected in thymus ( 21 , 23 , 37 ) .
In contrast , expression of NFATp and NFATc is mostly restricted to spleen and lymph nodes ( 38 , 43 ) , indicating that these are the major forms of NFAT present in mature T and B cells .
We therefore examined the presence of these two members of the NFAT complexes from ConA-stimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
Only one NFAT complex was detected in unstimulated eTh1 or eTh2 cells .
However , two components with different electrophoretic mobilities were present upon stimulation ( Fig .
5A ) .
The presence of anti-NFATp antiserum in the binding reaction supershifted the upper component but did not affect the lower Vor .
17 , 1997 component in stimulated effector cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
In contrast , anti-NFATc antiserum completely abolished the faster-migrating complex , while it competed only partially the upper complex ( Fig .
5B ) .
These data indicated that the lower NFAT complex present in stimulated effector cells contained mostly NFATe and the upper complex contained NFATp but not much NFATe .
However , no difference in the composition of the NFAT DNA binding complexes was observed between stimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
It seemed that the degree of competition of the upper complex with anti-NFATc antiserum was slightly higher in stimulated eTh1 cells than in eTh2 cells , but we did not consider this difference to be significant enough to account for the differences observed in the NFAT transcriptional activity ( Fig .
4B ) .
All the DNA binding analyses described above were performed using a double-strand oligonucleotide containing the NFAT binding site from the IL-2 promoter ( ILZ2-NFAT ) ( which was used to generated the reporter transgenic mice ) .
We decided to examine the specific DNA binding in differentiated eTh1 and eTh2 cells by using also the most characterized NFAT site ( -60 to -83 ) of the IL-4 promoter ( IL4-NFAT ) , since IL-4 expression is restricted to eTh2 cells .
However , no significant differences were expected since previous studies with Th1 and Th2 clones showed similar subunit compositions between IL2-NFAT and IL4-NFAT complexes ( 54 ) .
Nevertheless , we analyzed the nature of the complexes bound to the IL4-NFAT site and found that the gel profiles were identical to those observed with the IL2-NFAT oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5C ) .
Again , only the upper band was detected in unstimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cell extracts , and it was competed by anti-NFATp but not anti-NFATe antisera ( Fig .
5C ) .
Like IL2-NFAT complexes , upon ConA stimulation of both eTh1 and eTh2 cells , a faster-migrating component which was completely competed with anti-NFATc antiserum was also induced .
Two different antisera against anti-NFATp failed to inhibit the binding of this lower component ( Fig .
5C ) .
The nuclear component of NFAT has been shown to contain some AP-1 members , and AP-1-like sites are found next to the core NFAT binding site for both the IL2- and IL4-NFAT sequences ( 4 , 9 , 27 , 44 , 49 ) .
It was therefore possible that although no differences were detected in the cytoplasmic component of the NFAT complex , differences in the proteins bound to the AP-1 site account for the high transcriptional activity induced in eTh2 but not eTh1 cells .
However , no competition of the binding of IL4-NFAT complexes to DNA was observed in the presence of an unlabeled oligonucleotide with the AP-1 consensus sequence from the collagenase promoter ( Fig .
6A ) or metallothionein promoter ( data not shown ) .
Unlabeled ILA-NFAT and IL2-NFAT oligonucleotides completely inhibited DNA binding ( Fig .
6A ) .
Identical results were obtained when the IL2-NFAT sequence was used as a probe in the EMSA ( data not shown ) .
These data suggested that under our experimental conditions AP-1 components were not detected associated with NFAT and that DNA binding of the NFAT complexes from eTh1 and eTh2 cell extracts does not require the AP-1 regulatory element .
As a further control , we also analyzed NFAT DNA binding in extracts from Jurkat cells and D10 ( a CD4* Th2 clone ) cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin , but unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide could not compete NFAT binding ( Fig .
6B ) .
In addition to the sequence from -60 to -83 originally identified as a core for NFAT binding in the IL-4 promoter , an upstream element ( -84 to -91 ) has also been described more recently to be required to mediate transcription ( 54 , 63 ) and is believed to be the binding site for an AP-1-related protein .

Analysis of the AP-1 component in the NFAT complexes .
( A ) Nuclear extracts from eTh1 and eTh2 cells stimulated with ConA were analyzed by EMSA by using the ILA-NFAT oligonucleotide probe in the absence ( - ) or the presence of an excess ( 100-fold ) of cold collagenase AP-1 , IL2-NFAT , or IL4-NFAT oligonucleotide .

plus ionomycin ( 250 ng/m ! )
for 3 h were analyzed by EMSA by using the ILA4-NFAT oligonucleotide probe in the absence ( - ) or the presence of an excess ( 100-fold ) of cold collagenase AP-1 oligonucleotide .
( C ) Nuclear extracts from ConA-stimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cells were analyzed by using a longer sequence ( -60 to -91 ) of the NFAT binding site from the IL-4 promoter ( long ILA-NFAT ) as a probe .
Binding reactions were performed in the presence of anti-NFATp antiserum ( 0.2 pl ) or an excess ( 100-fold ) of cold AP-1 oligonucleotide ( AP1 ) .
stimulated eTh1 and eTh2 cells , by using a longer NFAT oligonucleotide which contained this upstream sequence ( -60 to -91 ) .
No differences were found between eTh1 and eTh2 cell complexes , and the presence of a cold AP-1 oligonucleotide did not modify the NFAT DNA binding .
Interestingly , the binding of the lower component was stronger with the longer 1532 RINCON AND FLAVELL IL4-NFAT sequence as a probe , suggesting that the upstream sequences are also involved and favor the binding of the NFATc protein .
DISCUSSION Although NFAT was originally associated specifically with the regulation of IL-2 gene transcription , NFAT DNA binding has also been detected in activated lymphoid cells other than T cells , and NFAT regulatory elements have been found in the promoter region of many cytokines .
In addition , NFAT is a family of several related proteins which are distributed differentially in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues .
Due to this redundancy and to the paucity of information that is available about the relevance of each of these NFAT proteins , the regulation of the transcription mediated by NFAT during the immune response remains unclear .
We therefore developed a highly sensitive system ( NFAT-Luc reporter transgenic mice ) to analyze NFAT transcriptional activity during the development of the mouse immune system and during the activation and differentiation of primary cells in response to antigens .
We have previously described the regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity during thymic development ( 52 ) .
Here , we have examined the regulation and signal requirement for DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFAT , first , in the activation of precursor T cells and , second , in the differentiation and activation of eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
Confirming previous reports using transgenic mice ( 67 ) , we showed that NFAT transcriptional activity is induced in both normal T and B cells upon stimulation and was dependent on both Ca** and PKC signals .
In addition , we demonstrated for the first time that activation via the TCR signal was not sufficient to induce NFAT transcriptional activity in precursor T cells and that a costimulatory signal was also required .
This costimulatory signal was mediated , at least partially , by the interaction of CD28/CTLA-4 with B7.1/B7.2 on the APC , although we can not eliminate the possibility that other costimulatory molecules are also involved .
In contrast , however , NFAT transcriptional activity did not require costimulation in eTh2 cells , and the signal mediated by the TCR induced much higher NFAT activity in these cells than in precursor T cells .
These requirements correlated with the signal requirements associated with a particular stage of differentiation ( 12 ) .
Thus , activation of precursor CD4 * T cells results in the production of IL-2 , which is strictly dependent on costimulation ( 41 ) , whereas a TCR-mediated signal is sufficient to induce IL-4 production in eTh2 .
We have also observed similar modifications in the signal requirement for AP-1 transcriptional activity ( 50 ) .
Together , these results indicate that the reprogramming of the signal requirement for a given effector function ( i.e. , IL-2 versus IL-4 production ) during the differentiation of pTh cells into eTh cells is due to the reprogramming for the signals needed to activate specific transcriptional factors .
The molecular basis for the distinction between the two kinds of effector cells , eTh1 and eTh2 , remains unknown , but differences in the transcriptional system that directs the expression of certain cytokines are likely to be important .
This question has been previously approached by others ( 53 , 54 ) ; by using Th1 and Th2 CD4 * T-cell clones , no differences in the activation of NFAT were observed .
We have shown here that NFAT is regulated similarly during the differentiation of pTh cells into either eTh1 or eTh2 cells .
During this process , NFAT probably mediates the transcription of the IL-2 gene , which is induced during the activation of pTh cells and is the main growth factor driving T-cell proliferation .
In contrast , once the cells have differentiated into eTh1 or eTh2 cells , NFAT tran Mor .

scriptional activity can be induced only after the stimulation of eTh2 cells , but to a much lesser extent in stimulated eTh1 cells .
These data indicate that NFAT is involved in the expression of Th2-type cytokines but that it is less important for the expression of -type cytokines .
In fact , NFAT regulatory elements which are secreted by eTh2 cells have been identified in the promoter region of the IL-4 ( 6 , 9 , 62 , 64 ) and IL-5 ( 42 ) genes .
No NFAT binding sites have been described yet in the promoter of the predominant Th1 cytokine , IFN-y ( 47 ) .
Since IL-2 is produced by Th1 clones and it is considered a Th1 cytokine , superficially NFAT should be expected to be functional in eTh1 cells .
We did not , however , find production of large amounts of IL-2 or IL-2 mRNA upon stimulation of freshly differentiated eTh1 cells by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assays .
We believe that Th1 T-cell clones make IL-2 because this is required for their continuing proliferation , a property for which they have been selected .
In contrast , eThl1 cells no longer need to proliferate to such a degree after differentiation has occurred .
The activation of Th1 clones has been described to require more costimulation than the activation of Th2 clones , raising the possibility that the lack of costimulation during the activation of eTh1 cells is cause for the lack of NFAT transcriptional activity .
However , our data showed that the provision of a source of costimulation by APC does not restore the induction of NFAT transcriptional activity in eTh1 cells .
There was only low transcription mediated by NFAT in eTh1 cells , which may account for the lack of expression of specific Th2 cytokines whose promoters contain such NFAT sites .
This nonetheless begs the question of how NFAT is functional in eTh2 cells but to a considerably lesser extent in eTh1 cells .
There are several possible explanations .
First , some of the NFAT members might be expressed only in eTh2 cells , or since NFAT proteins have a cytoplasmic localization and need to be translocated to the nucleus , they might fail to be translocated .
The analysis of NFAT DNA binding , using the NFAT binding site from the IL-2 promoter and one of the sites from the IL-4 promoter ( from =60 to -83 or from =60 to -91 ) , demonstrated , however , that both NFATc and NFATp members were present , could be translocated to the nucleus , and bound DNA in eTh1 and eTh2 cells .
Thus , the transcriptional activity induced in eTh2 cells is not a consequence of an overexpression of specific NFAT proteins .
A second potential explanation for the differential induction of NFAT transcriptional activity is the unique presence in eTh2 cells of specifically associated cofactors required for NFAT to mediate transcription .
Members of the Fos and Jun protein families have been shown to bind together with NFAT proteins , and this cooperation is required for stable binding of NFAT and to mediate transcription through the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters ( 4 , 27 , 44 , 54 ) .
However , special experimental conditions are required to detect the binding of the AP-1 component present in the NFAT complex ( 27 , 53 ) , it is not totally clear which Fos and Jun family member is involved in the complex in vivo and mediates transcription , and most experiments have been done with recombinant proteins .
In our hands , unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide completely failed to compete the strong binding of the NFAT c and NFAT p present in extracts from eTh1 and eTh2 cells , even when we used the longer NFAT binding oligonucleotide containing the AP-1/ Oct-like site ( 54 ) as a probe .
Furthermore , the presence of antiserum against different Fos and Jun proteins did not inhibit NFAT DNA binding ( data not shown ) , indicating that AP-1 was not required for NFAT DNA binding under our condi-tions .
Despite our negative results , we can not eliminate the possibility that some AP-1 components , which might not be Vor .
17 , 1997 required for DNA binding under our conditions but are required for NFAT to mediate transcription , are expressed selectively in eTh2 cells .
In fact , we have observed by using AP-1-luciferase transgenic mice that AP-1 transcriptional activity is induced in eTh2 cells but to a much lesser extent in eTh1 cells ( 50 ) .
Moreover , we have observed ( 50 ) that eTh2 but not eTh1 cells overexpress JunB and contain JunB complexes , which bind to the AP-1 regulatory element .
Interestingly , in correlation with our findings , all previous studies done to identify the AP-1 components required for NFAT activity describe JunB as the principal Jun family member present in the NFAT complexes ( 4 , 44 , 54 ) , suggesting that AP-1 contributes to NFAT transcriptional activity in Th2 cells .
However , in reporter transgenic mice where the luciferase gene was driven by the short NFAT regulatory site ( lacking the AP-1/Oct-like site ) from the IL-4 promoter , NFAT transcriptional activity is also preferentially induced in eTh2 cells ( 2a ) .
Thus , it is possible that both NFAT and AP-1 contribute to selective expression in eTh2 cells .
Finally , a third and interesting possibility is that in addition to the dephosphorylation of NFAT that causes the translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , further phosphorylation of the transactivation domain is required to mediate transcription , similar to the mechanism whereby other transcriptional factors , such as CREB , AP-1 , and some of the STAT members , are activated ( 20 , 51 ) .
Although no phosphorylation requirement for NFAT activity has been described , this potential postranslational modification of the NFAT component could be a specific characteristic of eTh2 cells .
No differences in the nature of the NFAT complexes present in the nucleus from eTh1 and eTh2 cells were observed .
In most experiments the level of NFAT complexes in Th1 and Th2 cells was equivalent .
In some experiments a slightly ( 1.5-to 2-fold ) greater level of NFAT complexes were observed in Th2 cells , and it is possible that a small difference like this explains , at least in part , the Th2/Th1l difference in NFAT activity .
It is striking that NFATp ( upper component ) was induced in pTh cells and remained present in unstimulated eTh cells , while the NFAT binding ( lower component ) is induced in eTh cells only upon stimulation .
These results indicate that NFATe probably mediates the transcription of effector molecules in eTh2 cells , while NFATp could be involved in the activation of precursor T cells .
This observation correlates with the fact that NFATp-deficient mice do not show significant differences in effector cytokine levels ( TNF-a , IFN , or IL-4 ) but increased proliferation in vitro in response to Leishmania major was observed ( 68 ) .
In addition , it seems that NFATp-deficient mice show , in contrast to predictions , an increase in the production of IL-4 in response to anti-CD3 MAb ( 22 ) .
Future studies will be needed to determine the NFAT transcriptional activity in eTh2 cells in the absence of the NFATp component .
Taken together , these data indicate that although NFAT proteins are present and able to bind DNA in both eTh1 and eTh2 cells , they are mainly transcriptionally functional in stimulated eTh2 cells , suggesting that NFAT plays an important role in expression of eTh2 specific effector molecules .
Moreover , the low level of NFAT-mediated transcription in eTh1 cells is probably in part the cause of the inability of these cells to express IL-4 .
This information could be relevant in the search to contain infections or autoimmune diseases , where the polarization to an eTh1 or eTh2 immune response determines the grade or susceptibility of resistance to a particular pathogen and the course of autoimmune pathogenesis .
