Biochemical purification and cDNA cloning has now revealed that BSAP belongs to the family of paired domain proteins .
BSAP is encoded by the Pax-5 gene and has been highly conserved between human and mouse .
An intact paired domain was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for DNA binding of BSAP .
Binding studies with several BSAP recognition sequences demonstrated that the sequence specificity of BSAP differs from that of the distantly related paired domain protein Pax-1 .
During embryogenesis , the BSAP gene is transiently expressed in the mesencephalon and spinal cord with a spatial and temporal expression pattern that is distinct from that of other Pax genes in the developing central nervous system ( CNS ) .
Later , the expression of the BSAP gene shifts to the fetal liver where it correlates with the onset of B lymphopoiesis .
BSAP expression persists in B lymphocytes and is also seen in the testis of the adult mouse .
All of this evidence indicates that the transcription factor BSAP may not only play an important role in B-cell differentiation but also in neural development and spermatogenesis .

A family of regulatory proteins that are involved in the control of segmentation and specification of cell fate during Drosophila embryogenesis share the highly conserved motif known as the paired box .
This domain of 128 amino acids was identified as a second homology region in the homeo box-containing proteins of the Drosophila paired and gooseberry genes ( Bopp et al .
1986 ; Baumgartner et al .
1987 ) .
The products of the tissue-specific genes pox meso and pox neuro were subsequently shown to contain only a paired domain and to be localized in the nucleus ( Bopp et al .
1989 ) , suggesting that paired domain proteins are transcription factors .
Recently , this hypothesis has been verified by demonstrating that the paired box encodes a novel DNA-binding motif ( Goulding et al .
1991 ; Treisman et al .
1991 ) and that the murine paired domain protein Pax-1 is a transcriptional activator ( Chalepakis et al .
1991 ) .
The paired domain proteins of vertebrates are encoded by a multigene family that has been conserved in evolu-tion .
To date , eight paired box genes , Pax-1-Pax-8 , have been isolated from the mouse genome [ Walther et al .

1991a , b ) , and four paired domain genes from human DNA ( Burri et al .
1989 ; Ton et al .
1991 ) .
The paired domain proteins of the different species can be grouped into six different classes according to their sequence similarity in the paired box ( Walther et al .
1991 ) .
The mouse Pax genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis in the neural tube of the embryo ( Pax-2 , Nornes et al .
1990 ; Pax-3 , Goulding et al .

1990 ; Pax-8 , Plachov et al .
1990 ) , or in the developing vertebral column [ Pax-1 , Deutsch et al .
1988 ) .
Mutations in the Pax-1 , Pax-3 , and Pax-6 genes have been associated with the three mouse developmental mutants undulated ( Balling et al .
1988 ) , splotch [ Epstein et al .
1991 ) , and small eye { Hill et al .
1991 } , respectively .
Moreover , genetic lesions in the human Pax-3 and Pax-6 genes were shown to cause Waardenburg 's syndrome ( Baldwin et al .
1992 ; Tassabehji et al .
1992 ) and aniridia ( Ton et al .
1991 ) .
All of this evidence strongly implicates the Pax proteins as important regulators in early development .
The target genes and , hence , the function of the vertebrate Pax proteins are still unknown mainly because the vertebrate Pax genes have been cloned and identified GENES & DEVELOPMENT 6:1589~1607 © 1992 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/92 $ 3.00 1589 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Adams et al .
solely on the basis of their sequence homology with Drosophila paired box genes [ Walther et al .
1991 and references therein ) .
In this report we describe the first biochemical purification of a paired domain protein , that is , the transcription factor BSAP , which was originally identified as a mammalian homolog of the sea urchin protein TSAP ( tissue-specific activator protein } .
The transcription factor TSAP was shown to be responsible for the developmental and tissue-specific regulation of two nonallelic pairs of late histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes of the sea urchin .
TSAP recognizes its four binding sites in these histone gene promoters with equal affinity , and yet these sites differ considerably in sequence , allowing the definition of only a degenerate consensus sequence ( Barberis et al .
1989 ) .
Subsequently , a mammalian DNA-binding activity was identified that interacts with these four TSAP-binding sites in a manner indistinguishable from that of the sea urchin protein .
Within the hematopoietic system , this mammalian factor is exclusively expressed in the B-lymphoid lineage from the pro-B cell up to the mature B-cell stage .
However , its activity is undetectable in terminally differentiated plasma cells .
This factor was shown to stimulate B-cell-specific transcription from a promoter containing a -binding site .
Hence , we referred to it as BSAP ( B-cell lineage-specific activator protein ; Barberis et al .
1990 } .
Recently , we have demonstrated that BSAP is involved in the regulation of the CD19 gene , which codes for a B-lymphoid-specific transmembrane receptor involved in signal transduction ( Kozmik et al .
1992 ) .
Biochemical purification and cDNA cloning revealed that BSAP is a member of the paired domain protein family .
It is encoded by the Pax-5 gene and has been highly conserved between human and mouse .
Mutational analysis identified the paired box as the only DNA-binding domain of BSAP .
The distantly related Pax-1 protein was shown to recognize known BSAP-binding sites , although with lower affinities than BSAP .
Expression of the BSAP/Pax-5 gene was not only detected in B-lymphoid tissues , but also in specific regions of the developing central nervous system [ ( CNS ) and in testis of the adult mouse .
Results Purification of the human BSAP protein The purification of BSAP from the human B-cell line BJA-B is summarized in Figure IA .
BSAP-binding activity was monitored by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay [ ( EMSA ) using the TSAP-binding site of the sea urchin histone H2A-2.2 gene as a probe .
Quantitation of the DNA-binding activity according to Calzone et al .
( 1988 ) revealed that BSAP had to be purified by a factor of 5 x 10° starting from BJA-B nuclear extracts .
Like many other transcripton factors , BSAP was found to be glycosylated ( Jackson and Tjian 1988 } and could therefore be enriched 250-fold by chromatography on a wheat germ lectin column .
The eluted BSAP fraction was applied to a DNA affinity column consisting of multimerized H2B- 1590 GENES & DEVELOPMENT total procedure - protein - BSAP _ purity ( mg ) ( ug ) Nuclear extract 1090 20 1:50,000 Lectin 4.8 22 1:200 DNA affinity 0.4 20 1:20 HPLC 0.015 5 1:2 37 38 39 37 38 39 110 84 BSAP - » satin < - BSAP 47 33 f y SDS-PAGE EMSA Figure 1 .

Values are given for the nuclear extract , the eluate of the wheat germ lectin column , the eluate of the DNA affinity column , and fraction 38 of the HPLC reverse-phase column { total of 66 fractions } .
The amount of total protein was determined by the method of Bradford [ 1976 ] by using a BSA standard .
The amount of BSAP was measured by quantitative gel-shift analysis according to Calzone et al .
( 1988 ) , assuming that the 50-kD BSAP peptide interacts as a monomer with its recognition sequence [ see Fig .
6A ) The protein amounts in HPLC fraction 38 were estimated from the prepar-ative SDS-polyacrylamide gel used as a last purification step before protein sequencing .
( B ) Analytical SDS-protein gel .
An aliquot of fractions 37-39 of the HPLC reverse-phase column was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel , and proteins were visualized by silver staining [ Wray et al .

2.2 TSAP recognition sequences coupled to Sepharose .
Chromatography on this DNA affinity resin resulted in an additional 10-fold purification of BSAP .
However , repeated chromatography was unsuccessful because nonionic detergents , which are required to protect BSAP-binding activity in dilution , reduced the affinity for specific recognition sequences by more than one order of magnitude [ B. Adams , unpubl . } .
Further purification of BSAP was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) on a C8 reverse-phase column .
A 50-kD polypeptide was eluted predominantly in fraction 38 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press and , to a lesser extent , in fraction 37 , as revealed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining ( Fig .
1B ) .
The EMSA experiment of Figure 1C showed that BSAP-binding activity was present in these two fractions in a ratio that closely paralleled the abundance of the 50-kD peptide ( Fig .
1C ) .
This observation and the previous determination of a molecular mass of 50 kD for BSAP by UV cross-linking ( Barberis et al .
1990 ] strongly suggested that the purified 50-kD peptide corresponded to BSAP .
BSAP is a paired domain protein The 50-kD protein of the HPLC fraction 38 was isolated by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to trypsin digestion followed by purification and microsequencing of individual peptides .
Reliable amino acid sequence data were obtained for the two peptides shown in Figure 2A .
A computer search of the SwissProt data base revealed that the sequence of peptide 1 is present in the middle of the paired box of all Drosophila and mouse paired domain proteins known so far ( for review , see Walther et al .
1991 ) .
The second peptide was only found in the carboxy-terminal half of the paired domain of Pax-2 ( Dressler et al .
1990 ] and Pax-8 ( Plachov et al .
1990 } , suggesting that BSAP belongs to the same subclass of Pax proteins .
The limited amino acid sequence information suggested , therefore , that BSAP is a member of the growing family of paired domain proteins .
This hypothesis was verified by the antibody experiment of Figure 2B .

{ B ) EMSA .
Polyclonal rabbit anti-Paired [ Prd ] or preimmune serum { 1 pd of a fivefold dilution ) was added to the DNA-binding reaction containing partially purified BSAP ( eluate of the lectin column } and the H2A-2.2 TSAP-binding probe ( oligonucleotide 1 of Fig .
7D ) .
The paired domain transcription factor BSAP shown to specify a DNA-binding function { Chalepakis et al .
1991 ; Goulding et al .
1991 ; Treisman et al .
1991 ) , we reasoned that polyclonal antibodies against the Drosophila Paired [ Prd ] protein might recognize conserved epitopes in the putative paired domain of BSAP and thus prevent DNA binding .
As shown in Figure 2B , a Prd an-tiserum , but not a preimmune serum , specifically blocked the DNA-binding activity of BSAP , thus demonstrating that BSAP is a paired domain protein .
Cloning and identification of human BSAP cDNA Degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the two BSAP peptides were used to isolate part of the BSAP paired domain by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) cloning from human BJA-B and mouse 70Z/3 cDNA , respectively .
As shown by Northern blot analysis [ Fig .
3A ) , the human PCR probe detected a transcript of ~10 kb in B cells ( BJA-B ) and pre-B cells { REH } , both of which were shown previously to be positive for BSAP-binding activity ( Barberis et al .
1990 ) .
No hybridization signal was observed with the plasma cell line RPMI 8226 and with Hela cells in agreement with the absence of BSAP-binding activity in these cells .
This analysis therefore indicates that BSAP is encoded by a ~10-kb-long mRNA .
Both the human and mouse PCR probes were used to screen BJA-B and 70Z7/3 cDNA libraries , respectively .
A human clone with a 3277-bp cDNA insert ( hBSAP-1 ) and a mouse clone with a 926-bp cDNA insert { ( mBSAP-1 ] were isolated [ Fig .
3D ) .
As both cDNA clones covered only part of the 10-kb BSAP mRNA , we then asked whether they contained at least the entire protein-coding region .
For this purpose , the two cDNA sequences were cloned into the expression plasmid pKW10 .
This vector drives expression of cDNA inserts from the strong cyto-megalovirus ( CMV ) enhancer-promoter region and , furthermore , is able to replicate to high levels in polyoma large T-expressing COP-8 cells ( Tyndall et al .
1981 ) .
Sense and antisense expression constructs were transfected into COP-8 cells , and whole-cell extracts were prepared for EMSA with the H2A-2.2 TSAP-binding probe .
As shown in Figure 3B , the hBSAP-1 cDNA in the sense , but not in the antisense , orientation gave rise to a protein-DNA complex that comigrated with the endogenous BSAP activity of BJA-B extracts .
Moreover , a single C- A mutation at the invariant position within the TSAP-binding site [ Barberis et al .
1990 } diminished binding of the endogenous ( BJA-B ) as well as exogenous [ COP activity to the same degree .
We therefore concluded that the human cDNA clone hBSAP-1 contains the entire coding region for BSAP .
In contrast , the mBSAP-1 cDNA directed the synthesis of only a partial BSAP polypeptide [ P. Déorfler , data not shown ) .
The complete coding sequence of mouse BSAP mRNA ( mBSAP-2 ) was subsequently isolated from 70Z/3 cDNA by PCR cloning ( Fig .
3D ) .
Ultimate identification of the cDNA clones was achieved with polyclonal antibodies raised against the paired domain ( amino acids 17-145 ) and the carboxy-terminal region { 189-391 ) of the protein that is encoded GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1591 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Adams et al .

( B ) Expression of BSAP protein in COP-8 cells .
hBSAP-1 cDNA was cloned in the sense [ s ) or antisense ( a ) orientation into the expression vector pKW1O , followed by transient transfection into COP-8 cells and preparation of whole-cell extracts .
These COP-8 extracts and nuclear extracts of BJA-B cells were analyzed by EMSA with a wild-type { ( wt } or mutant ( mut ) H24-2.2 TSAP-binding probe { oligonucleotides 1 and 2 of Fig .
7D ) .
( C ) Interaction of specific antibodies with endogenous BSAP .
Preimmune serum ( P ) or polyclonal rabbit antiserum ( { I ; 1 pul of a fivefold dilution ) raised against a BSAP peptide containing either amino acids 17-145 or 189-391 was added together with BJA-B nuclear extract and the H2A-2.2 TSAP probe to the DNA-binding reaction [ 20 pl ) before EMSA .
Unspecific protein-DNA complexes are indicated by asterisks ( * ) .
{ D ) Schematic diagram of BSAP cDNA clones .
The position of the mRNA 5 ' end relative to the BSAP-coding sequence ( boxed ) was determined by PCR amplification of 55 cDNA ends [ P. Urbanek , unpubl . ) .
The paired domain is marked by a solid box .
The origin of the cDNA clones is indicated by A ( Agt10 cDNA library } or PCR { PCR cloning } .
by the cDNA clone hBSAP-1 .
Both antibodies interacted specifically with the endogenous BSAP activity of BJA-B cells , as shown by EMSA ( Fig .
3C ) .
The anti-paired domain serum , but not the preimmune serum , prevented DNA binding of BSAP consistent with the result obtained with antibodies raised against the entire Drosophila Prd protein [ Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast , antibodies raised against carboxy-terminal sequences did not interfere with DNA binding but , instead , shifted the BSAP complex to a more slowly migrating position in the gel .
Both 1592 GENES & DEVELOPMENT BSAP antisera did not affect Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding in control experiments [ P. Dorfler , unpubl . ) .
Taken together , these data therefore demonstrate that the hBSAP-1 cDNA clone codes for authentic BSAP .
BSAP is evolutionarily conserved and encoded by the Pax-5 gene The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of clone hBSAP-1 are shown in Figure 4 .
The first translation ini- Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press tiation site TCAAAATGG in this sequence fits well with the consensus sequence CCPuCCATGG at the two most critical positions for optimal initiation of translation ( Kozak 1991 ) and , in addition , is immediately preceded by an in-frame stop codon .
This initiation site is followed by an open reading frame [ ( ORF ) encoding a protein of 391 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42.1 kD .
The discrepancy between the calculated and apparent ( 50-kD ) molecular mass of BSAP is most likely caused by post-translational modification such as O-linked glycosylation { see Fig .
1 ) and/or by anomalous migration of BSAP owing to a relatively high proline content ( Fig .
4 ) .
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) analysis ( Frohman et al .
1988 ) revealed that ~100-200 nucleotides up to the correct 5 end of BSAP mRNA are missing in the cDNA sequence shown in Figure 4 { P. Urbanek , unpubl . ) .
Moreover , the 3 sequences of the cDNA insert neither contain a polyadenylation signal nor a poly ( A ) tail , suggesting that only 2 kb of the ~8.6-kb-long trailer of BSAP have been cloned .
BSAP exhibits the following notable features .
It contains a paired domain close to the amino terminus { ( amino acids 16-143 ) and the conserved octapeptide YSISGILG { amino acids 179-186 } , which deviates only at two amino acid positions from the sequence found in most other paired domain proteins ( Burfi et al .
1989 ; Jostes et al .
1991 ) .
BSAP lacks a classical paired-type homeo domain as it is found in a subclass of Pax proteins .
However , it contains a region of 23 amino acids ( 229-251 ) that is homologous to the amino-terminal half of the homeo domain of Pax-3 , Pax-6 , and Pax-7 , both with regard to its sequence ( 13-15 identical amino acids ) and its position downstream of the paired domain .
A similar homology has recently been identified in Pax-2 and Pax-8 ( Krauss et al .
1991a ; Walther and Gruss 1991 ) .
It remains to be seen whether this sequence conservation is functionally significant or represents only an evolutionary remnant of the homeo box in these proteins .
BSAP also possesses two regions with a high proportion { 48 % and 35 % ) of serine and threonine residues and ends in a sequence that is both rich in serine/threonine as well as proline ( 39 % in total ; Fig .
4B } .
These features are reminiscent of the serine/threonine-rich trans-activation domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 ( Tanaka and Herr 1990 ) .
Sequence analysis of the mouse BSAP cDNA clone showed that the human and mouse BSAP proteins differ only by three amino acid exchanges , whereas their coding sequences have diverged by 7.7 % at the DNA level owing to silent site substitutions .
Pax-6 , for which the entire human and mouse sequences are also known , differs in a single amino acid position between the two species ( Ton et al .
1991 ; Walther and Gruss 1991 ) .
These two findings strongly suggest that Pax proteins are subject to high evolutionary constraints even outside of their paired domains .
After completion of our biochemical purification and cDNA cloning of BSAP , Walther et al .
{ 1991 } described the isolation of the Pax-5 gene from a mouse genomic library by cross-hybridization with a Pax-1 paired box DNA probe ( Walther et al .
1991 ) .
However , no expres- The paired domain transcription factor BSAP sion data were provided for this gene ; furthermore , no corresponding cDNA could be isolated from mouse embryonic cDNA libraries .
Hence , only the two exons coding for the paired domain of murine Pax-5 were identified .
Comparison with our mouse BSAP cDNA sequence revealed that the nucleotide sequences of these two exons of Pax-5 are identical with the corresponding BSAP cDNA sequence .
We conclude , therefore , that BSAP is encoded by the Pax-5 gene .
Walther et al .
{ 1991 ) have already demonstrated that Pax-2 , Pax-5 ( BSAP ) , and Pax-8 are closely related to one another in their paired domains , thus constituting a subclass of paired box proteins .
As shown in Figure 5 , the homology between these three proteins even extends into their central and carboxy-terminal sequences .
However , BSAP is the shortest of all three proteins as it lacks a stretch of 23 amino acids of Pax-2 and a domain of 69 amino acids of Pax-8 , both of which may be encoded by separate exons in their respective gene .
An intact paired domain is both necessary and sufficient for DNA binding of BSAP Mutational analysis of the Drosophila Prd and mouse Pax-1 proteins has demonstrated recently that the paired domain encodes a novel DNA-binding motif ( Chalepakis et al .
1991 ; Treisman et al .
1991 ) .
To test whether the paired domain alone is sufficient for DNA binding of BSAP , we have subjected the BSAP-coding sequences to a carboxy-terminal deletion analysis , expressed the truncated proteins in COP-8 cells , and analyzed their DNA-binding potential by EMSA ( Fig .
6A ) .
Deletion of carboxy-terminal sequences up to amino acid position 163 had no effect on the DNA binding of BSAP , demonstrating that the octapeptide and the homeo box homology region are dispensable for the interaction of BSAP with DNA .
Further deletion up to position 107 in the paired domain completely abolished DNA binding .
The same result was obtained with an internal deletion mutant lacking amino acids 122-186 [ Fig .
6A ) .
Western blot analysis with anti-paired domain antibodies demonstrated that the two nonbinding polypeptides were expressed in COP-8 cells as stable proteins and with efficiency similar to the DNA-binding polypeptides ( Fig .
6A ) .
We observed , however , that the three BSAP polypeptides terminating at amino acids 111 , 116 , and 121 in the paired domain were too unstable in transfected COP-8 cells to be detected by Western blot analysis ( P. Dorfler , unpubl . ) .
These three proteins , once synthesized by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates , also completely fail to bind to DNA ( Fig .
6B ) .
Taken together , these results clearly demonstrate that an intact paired domain is both necessary and sufficient for DNA binding of BSAP .
As all information for high affinity DNA binding of BSAP is contained within the paired domain , we then investigated , using the method of Hope and Struhl ( 1987 ) , whether BSAP binds as a monomer or dimer to its recognition sequence .

Amino acid sequence comparison of mBSAP , mPax-2 , and mPax-8 .
The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clones mBSAP-1 and mBSAP-2 ( see Fig .
3D ) was aligned with the protein sequence of mouse Pax-2 ( Dressler et al .
1990 ) and Pax-8 ( Plachov et al , 1990 ) .
Amino acids residues that are identical to the BSAP sequence are highlighted by black overlay .
Additional homologies between mPax-2 and mPax-8 are indicated by stippled boxes .
The three amino acid substitutions present at positions 13 , 282 , and 374 in human BSAP are shown above the mouse BSAP sequence .
The mPax-2 sequence was corrected at positions 115 ( D ) , 116 ( R ) , and 119 [ A ) , and the mPax-8 sequence at positions 158 ( T } , 263 ( Y } , and 340 ( D ) according to our own PCR cloning and sequencing data { Z. Kozmik , unpubl . ) .

consisting of either the amino-terminal 220- or 163-amino-acid residues of BSAP .
Only small and large BSAP complexes , but no complexes of intermediate size , were detected by EMSA { Fig .
6A , lanes a +b , a +d ) .
This finding clearly indicates that short and long BSAP polypeptides do not form heterodimers and , hence , that BSAP binds to DNA as a monomer .
BSAP and Pax-1 recognize the same DNA sequences with different affinities We next asked whether the previously characterized BSAP-binding sites are also recognized by Pax proteins that are distantly related to BSAP/Pax-5 .
For these experiments we have chosen Pax-1 , which differs from BSAP in the paired domain at 38 of 128 amino acid po sitions ( Walther et al .
1991 ) .
Both the Pax-1 and BSAP proteins were expressed in transiently transfected COP-8 cells and then analyzed by EMSA for specific binding to the seven recognition sequences shown in Figure 7D .
The binding experiments of Figure 7A clearly demonstrate that both BSAP and Pax-1 interact with the sites present in the sea urchin H2A-2.2 and human CD19 genes , as well as with the e5 sequence of the Drosophila even-skipped promoter .
Moreover , both proteins generated an identical methylation interference pattern on three of these recognition sequences analyzed ( Fig .
7B ) .
To assess and compare the DNA-binding affinities of BSAP and Pax-1 for the different sites , we have performed saturation binding assays based on quantitative gel-shift measurements ( Calzone et al .
1988 ; for details , see Materials and methods ) .

as the ratio of the specific to the nonspecific binding constant , and therefore directly measures the relative affinity of a protein for a given specific site .
The K , values of BSAP and Pax-1 were measured for five and two binding sites , respectively , and are listed in Figure 7D .
P , , corresponds to the total concentration of active DNA-binding protein in the extract and is determined by the intersection of the curve with the x-axis .
Scatchard analysis with sites 5 and 7 revealed a twofold higher concentration of active Pax-1 than BSAP in our COP-8 cell extracts ( Fig .
7C ) .
A practical implication of the above analysis was that the concentration of the two proteins and of the specific DNA probes could be carefully adjusted in the EMSA experiment of Figure 7A to facilitate direct comparison of BSAP and Pax-1 binding to the different sites [ see legend to Fig .
7A ) .
This comparison was particularly important for low affinity sites for which K , values could not be accurately determined in our saturation binding as-says .
BSAP clearly bound to all seven sites with higher affinity than Pax-1 , confirming the trend observed with the K , values of sites 5 and 7 .
The difference between the two proteins was greatest for the binding site of the sea urchin H2A-2.2 gene ( ~20-fold ) while it was smallest for the mutant version PRS-4 of the Drosophila e5 sequence { ~2-fold } , which has recently been described as a high affinity site for Pax-1 ( Chalepakis et al , 1991 ) .
Thus , BSAP and Pax-1 clearly differ in their sequence specifi-city .
We have also identified two single point mutations with completely contrasting effects on protein binding .
A single C- A mutation in the high affinity site of the H2A-2.2 gene , which drastically decreased BSAP binding in agreement with our previous analysis ( Barberis et al .
1990 } , also reduced Pax-1 binding beyond the detection limit .
In contrast , a single A insertion into the BSAP site 2 of the CD19 promoter ( Kozmik et al .
1992 ) increased the affinity of BSAP for this site by a factor of ~30 .
The same A insertion also created the strongest binding site known so far for Pax-1 .
In summary , we have demon strated that the distantly related BSAP and Pax-1 proteins are able to bind to the same sequences although with widely different affinities .
Expression of the BSAP/Pax-5 gene in B-lymphoid tissues and testis of the adult mouse The expression of the BSAP gene was mapped in a panel of different B-lymphoid cell lines by RNase protection analysis .
As a control , the level of mRNA coding for the ribosomal $ 16 protein was determined by Sl nuclease mapping ( Fig .
8A ) .
BSAP expression was only detected in cell lines representing the pro-B , pre-B , and mature B-cell stages of B-lymphoid differentiation .
BSAP was , however , not expressed in plasma cells ( Fig .
8A ) and all other hematopoietic cell lines tested ( P. Dorfler , unpubl . ) .
This expression pattern fully agrees with our previous BSAP-binding studies ( Barberis et al .
1990 ) and suggests that BSAP expression is regulated at the transcriptional level .
These findings furthermore confirm that the BSAP gene is expressed within the hematopoietic system only at the early stages of B-cell differentiation .
In agreement with this conclusion , BSAP expression is high in spleen , lymph node , and blood , the three B-lymphoid tissues of the adult mouse that were analyzed by RNase protection assay ( Fig .
8B ) .
Lower levels of BSAP mRNA were detected in lung and salivary gland .
However , these two tissues also contained detectable amounts of immunoglobulin x constant [ c , . )
gene tran-scripts , indicating that both tissues were contaminated with blood and that their BSAP mRNA therefore originated from B lymphocytes .
We have recently demonstrated that BSAP is involved in the regulation of the gene coding for the B-lymphoid-specific transmembrane receptor CD19 ( Kozmik et al .
1992 ) .
Consistent with this finding , the level of CD19 mRNA closely parallels that of the BSAP gene transcript in the three lymphoid tissues analyzed .
Testis was the only non-B-lymphoid tissue that Figure 7 .

showed a high level of BSAP gene expression .
Neither the CD19 nor the immunoglobulin x light-chain genes were expressed in testis , thus ruling out blood contamination as a source for BSAP mRNA in this tissue .
In summary , we conclude that the BSAP/Pax-5 gene is ex The paired domain transcription factor BSAP pressed both in B lymphocytes and testis of the adult mouse .
Moreover , CD19 appears to be a strictly B-lymphoid-specific target gene of BSAP .
Expression of the BSAP/Pax-5 gene in the developing midbrain The BSAP gene is expressed in two waves during mouse embryogenesis , as shown by the RNase protection analysis of Figure 8C .
BSAP gene transcripts start to accumulate between day 9.5 and 10.5 postcoitum [ p.c .
) , reach maximal levels both in the head and trunk of the embryo between day 11.5 and 13.5 , and then start to decline in abundance in these two parts of the body .
This first wave of expression results entirely from transcription of the BSAP gene in the developing CNS { see below ) and , interestingly enough , is not accompanied by expression of the target gene CD19 .
Later in embryogenesis , the site of Pax-5 expression shifts to the fetal liver , where its expression gradually increases from day 13.5 onward in parallel with that of the CD19 gene .
This second expression pattern coincides nicely with the onset of B lymphopoiesis in fetal liver ( Rolink and Melchers 1991 ) .
The spatial and temporal expression pattern of the BSAP gene was analyzed in the developing brain by in situ hybridization ( [ Fig .
9 ) .
Serial sections of 11.5- and 14.5-day embryos were hybridized with antisense RNA probes corresponding to the central and carboxy-termi-nal-coding sequences of the mouse BSAP or control Pax-8 gene .
At day 11.5 of gestation , strong expression of the BSAP gene is detected in the posterior part of the mesencephalon .
BSAP expression is confined in this region to the tegmental neuroepithelium on both sides of the fovea of the isthmus ( Fig .
9B , C ) .
Some expression of BSAP mRNA is also seen in the posterior end of the collicular neuroepithelium of the tectum [ Fig .
9B ) .
However , the BSAP gene is not expressed along the rthomben-cephalon in marked contrast to the Pax-8 gene , which is expressed in the region of the pons [ Fig .
9D ; Plachov et al .
1990 ) .
At day 14.5 , expression of the BSAP gene is much more restricted locally and is seen only in a small neuroepithelial region immediately centering around the fovea of the isthmus ( Fig .
9F ) .
As seen in the transverse section of Fig .
9G , BSAP gene expression is absent from both the roof and central floor plate of the mesencephalon .
However , strong BSAP expression is seen laterally on both ventral sides of the third ventricle .
As shown in the close-up image of Figure 9H , the BSAP gene is expressed in the cells of the subependymal matrix but not in the epithelial cells of the ependyma .
Expression of the BSAP/Pax-5 gene in the developing neural tube All murine Pax genes analyzed so far are expressed in the neural tube along the entire anterior-posterior axis , with the exception of Pax-1 .
The Pax-5 gene also conforms to this rule , as shown by the in situ hybridization analysis of Figure 10 .
Initially , the neural tube consists of a single GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1599 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Adams et al .
neuroepithelial layer , the ventricular zone , which is radially arranged around the neural canal .
The cells in the ventricular zone are mitotically active and generate the stem cell population of the CNS .
A second zone , the mantle layer , forms between day 11 and 12 in a precise temporal and spatial pattern starting in the most ventral region of the basal plate ( Fig .
10D , diagram } .
The mantle layer consists of differentiating postmitotic neurons that migrate radially away from the ventricular zone ( Nornes et al .
1990 and references therein ) .
Figure 10 shows the analysis of a longitudinal section through the thoracic part of the neural tube of a 12.5-day embryo , which was hybridized either with the antisense or the control sense BSAP RNA probe ( Fig .
10B , C ) .
Interestingly , BSAP ex-pression , as detected with the antisense RNA probe , is confined to a cell layer that constitutes the border between the ventricular zone and the mantle layer .
Discussion BSAP is encoded by the Pax-5 gene BSAP has been characterized previously as a B-cell lineage-specific transcription factor that is expressed at early , but not late , stages of B-lymphoid differentiation { Barberis et al .

Here , we describe the purification and cDNA cloning of BSAP from human BJA-B cells .
Although only a partial cDNA clone corresponding to the 5¢ part of a ~10-kb transcript could be isolated , it was shown to code for authentic BSAP by four different cri-teria .
First , the ORF of this cDNA clone contains the two peptide sequences obtained by microsequencing of BSAP [ Fig .
4 ) .
Second , expression of the cDNA clone in COP-8 cells gives rise to a DNA-binding activity that is indistinguishable from the endogenous BSAP activity of BJA -B cells [ Fig .
3A ) .
Third , antibodies raised against the Figure 9 .

3B ) .
Fourth , the expression profile of the mRNA detected by the cloned cDNA completely correlates with the pattern of BSAP-binding activity in a large panel of hematopoietic cells ( Fig .
8 ; P. Dorfler , unpubl . ) .
The BSAP protein contains a classical paired domain at its amino terminus and is therefore a member of the Pax protein family .
BSAP is most closely related to the mouse Pax-2 and Pax-8 proteins and , hence , belongs to subclass III , as defined by Walther et al .
{ 1991 ) .
Recently , The paired domain transcription factor BSAP a third member of this subclass , Pax-5 , was identified by screening a mouse genomic library with a Pax-1 paired box probe .
However , only the two exons coding for the conserved paired domain of Pax-5 could be identified in the absence of cloned cDNA { Walther et al .
1991 ) .
The cloning of mouse BSAP cDNA has revealed complete identity between these two exons of the Pax-5 gene and the corresponding BSAP cDNA sequence , demonstrating that BSAP is encoded by the Pax-5 gene ( Fig .
5 ) .
Moreover , the human and mouse BSAP proteins have diverged Figure 9 .

The plane of the longitudinal section shown in A-C is indicated .
only at 3 of 391 amino acid positions .
An equally high conservation between human and mouse is also observed for Pax-6 ( Ton et al .
1991 ; Walther and Gruss 1991 ) , suggesting that Pax proteins are subject to high evolutionary constraints even outside of their paired domains .
BSAP contains three serine/threonine-rich regions , in the central and carboxy-terminal part , which may harbor a potential trans-activation function in analogy to the serine/threonine-rich trans-activation domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 ( Tanaka and Herr 1990 ) .
Previously , we have demonstrated by transient transfection experiment that the endogenous BSAP activity of B cells is able to stimulate transcription from a minimal promoter containing a BSAP recognition sequence ( Barberis et al .
1990 ; 1602 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Kozmik et al .
1992 ) .
However , the same reporter genes could not be stimulated by ectopic expression of BSAP cDNA in heterologous cells despite the fact that BSAP-binding activity was readily detectable in the transfected cells [ P. Dorfler , unpubl . } .
A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that transcriptional activity of BSAP critically depends on a B-cell-specific modification and/or requires the interaction with another B-lymphoid-specific component of the transcription machin-ery .
DNA-binding properties of BSAP/Pax-5 The paired domain has recently been identified as a novel DNA-binding motif of the Drosophila Prd { Treis- Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press man et al .
1991 ) and the murine Pax-1 and Pax-3 proteins { Chalepakis et al .
1991 ; Goulding et al .
1991 ) .
Mutational analysis of BSAP has demonstrated that an intact paired domain was both necessary and sufficient for DNA binding of BSAP [ Fig .
6 ) .
BSAP appears to differ in this respect from the Drosophila Prd and murine Pax-1 proteins , both of which bind to DNA even in the absence of the last 35 carboxy-terminal amino acids of their paired domain , albeit with reduced affinity ( Chalepakis et al .
1991 ; Treisman et al .
1991 ) .
Many transcription factors , including steroid receptors , basic leucine zipper { bZIP } , and basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) proteins , bind as homo- or heterodimers to their recognition sequences { for review , see Jones 1990 ) .
BSAP clearly lacks a dimer-ization function , as no interaction between full-length and truncated forms of BSAP was observed in DNA -binding assays ( Fig .
6 ) .
Paired domain proteins such as BSAP therefore bind as monomers to their target DNA .
In agreement with this finding , the recognition sequences of BSAP are generally not palindromic ( Barberis et al .
1990 ; Kozmik et al .
1992 ) .
The paired domain has been well conserved in evolu-tion , raising the question whether all Pax proteins are identical with regard to their sequence recognition .
A comparison of BSAP and Pax-1 demonstrated that Pax-1 binds to known BSAP recognition sites and likewise that BSAP interacts with the recently characterized Pax-1-binding site derived from the e5 sequence of the Drosophila even-skipped promoter .
Moreover , both proteins recognize the same G residues within these recognition sequences , as shown by methylation interference analysis [ Fig .
7 ) .
However , quantitative gel-shift experiments revealed a clear difference in binding affinity between the two proteins , as BSAP binds more strongly than Pax-1 to all of the sites analyzed .
These data therefore suggest that the Pax proteins of the different subclasses ( Walther et al .
1991 ] exhibit different sequence-binding specificities due to amino acid changes in their paired domains .
We have previously shown that the DNA sequence recognition of BSAP is identical to that of the sea urchin transcription factor TSAP ( Barberis et al .
1990 ) .
The recent cDNA cloning of this sea urchin factor confirmed that it is highly homologous in the paired domain to BSAP and thus belongs to the same subclass of Pax proteins { T. Czemy and M. Busslinger , unpubl . } .
For both proteins only a degenerate consensus recognition sequence ( shown in Fig .
7D ) could be deduced from the four high affinity sites present in the sea urchin histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes ( Barberis et al .
1989 ) and the two binding sites identified in the human CD19 promoter ( Kozmik et al , 1992 ) .
Correct alignment of all six sequences was only obtained by comparing three different parameters , that is , primary sequence , DNase I footprint , and methylation interference pattern .
This alignment predicts that insertion of an A residue into CD19 site 2 improves the homology to the consensus sequence by eliminating a l-nuceotide gap and , consequently , should increase the affinity of this site for BSAP ( [ Fig .
7D ; Kozmik et al .
1992 ) .
This A insertion not only created The paired domain transcription factor BSAP the highest affinity site for BSAP but also for Pax-1 [ Fig .
7D ) .
In this context it is , however , important to note the following two points .
First , BSAP binds with relatively high affinity to the Drosophila e5 site and the derived PRS-4 sequence ( Fig .
7 ) ; yet we were unable to unequivocally align these two sites with our BSAP consensus sequence .
Second , Chalepakis et al .
( 1991 ) have recently defined a DNA-binding core motif ( GTTCC ) for Pax-1 by mutational analysis of the Drosophila e5 sequence .
This pentanucleotide is not only absent from our highest affinity site for Pax-1 , but also from all other binding sites .
These two observations nicely document the degenerate sequence recognition of paired domain proteins and emphasize the limited value of consensus sequences and core motifs for Pax proteins .
Expression of the BSAP/Pax-5 gene in the developing CNS All murine Pax genes , including the BSAP gene are transiently expressed in the developing CNS except for Pax-1 { see introductory section ] .
The expression of the BSAP gene is , however , delayed with regard to that of other Pax genes .
BSAP expression peaks in the brain between embryonic day 11.5 and 13.5 and is locally restricted to the tegmental neuroepithelium at the posterior end of the mesencephalon ( Fig .
9 ) .
The BSAP gene is not expressed in the rhombencephalon in contrast to the other two members of the same subclass , Pax-2 and Pax-8 ( Fig .
9D ; Nornes et al .
1990 ; Plachov et al .
1990 ) .
No BSAP gene transcripts were detectable in the neural tube at embryonic day 10.5 in contrast to Pax-2 ( Nornes et al .
1990 ) and Pax-8 mRNA ( A. Aguzzi , unpubl .
) ; however , weak BSAP expression was observed at day 12.5 ( Fig .
10 ) .
At this developmental stage the neural tube consists of the ventricular zone containing the mitotically active neu-ronal stem cells and of the mantle layer comprising the differentiating postmitotic neurons [ ( Normmes et al .
1990 } .
BSAP expression was confined to a cell layer at the border between these two zones ( Fig .
10 } .
In conclusion , the BSAP gene differs from the other Pax genes studied so far with regard to its spatial and temporal expression pattern in the developing CNS .
BSAP/Pax-5 expression in testis and B-lymphoid tissues B lymphocyte development is initiated in the fetal liver at day 13 of gestation ( Rolink and Melchers 1991 ) .
BSAP gene expression in this hematopoietic organ correlates nicely with the onset of B lymphopoiesis [ Fig .
8C ) in agreement with the fact that BSAP was originally identified as a B-cell-specific transcription factor expressed at early stages of B-cell differentiation ( Barberis et al .
1990 } .
Expression of the BSAP gene in B-lymphoid tissues persists into adult life in contrast to its transient expression in the CNS .
Transcripts of the BSAP gene are localized to B-cell follicles in the adult spleen and lymph nodes , as shown by in situ hybridization ( A. Aguzzi , unpubl . ) .
Un-expectedly , the BSAP gene is also transcribed in the tes- GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1603 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Adams et al .
tis of the adult mouse ( Fig .
8 ) .
The BSAP/Pax-5 gene is therefore the first member of the Pax gene family reported to be expressed in testis ( Walther et al .
1991 and references therein ) .
The specific cells within the testis that express the BSAP gene remain to be identified .
What is the role of BSAP in B-cell differentiation ?
Previously , we have shown that known regulatory regions of immunoglobulin and class II major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ] genes lack high-affinity binding sites for BSAP , suggesting that this transcription factor may be involved in the regulation of a different set of B-lymphoid-specific genes ( Barberis et al .
1990 ) .
Recently , we have identified the gene coding for the B-cell-specific transmembrane protein CD19 as a BSAP target .
A high-affinity BSAP-binding site instead of a TATA box was shown to be located in the -30 region of this gene upstream of a cluster of heterogeneous start sites .
Moreover , BSAP was shown to bind to this site in vivo in CD19-expressing B cells but not in plasma or HeLa cells ( Kozmik et al .
1992 ) .
We now demonstrate that expression of the CD19 gene does not only correlate with BSAP expression in adult B-lymphoid tissues but also during early B lymphopoiesis in fetal liver ( Fig .
8 ) .
However , the CD19 gene is neither expressed in the developing CNS nor in adult testis , demonstrating that CD19 is a B-lymphoid-specific target gene of BSAP .
This B-cell specificity may be achieved by regulating the accessibility of the CD19 promoter at the chromatin level or by cooperation of BSAP with another B-cell-specific transcription factor .
Given the enormous size of the BSAP trailer sequences , it is also conceivable that transcripts of this gene are differentially spliced in different tissues , giving rise to functionally distinct isoforms , only one of which may correspond to the transcription factor BSAP .
The Pax-5 gene has been localized to mouse chromosome 4 close to the mos and etl-2 genes ( Walther et al .
1991 ) .
So far , no developmental mutants have been mapped to this chromosomal region .
Mutations in the BSAP/Pax-5 gene may be expected to create a pleiotropic phenotype in view of the expression of this gene in three distinct cell lineages .
To test this hypothesis and to gain insight into the role of BSAP during early development , we are currently inactivating the BSAP gene in the mouse germ line by homologous recombination .
Materials and methods Protein purification and microsequencing Nuclear extracts were prepared from BJA-B cells , as described by Dignam et al .
( 1983 ) , except that all buffers contained the following protease inhibitors : 1 mm PMSF , 0.5 ug/ml of leupeptin , 40 ug/ml of TLCK , and 5 ug/ml each of aprotinin , pepstatin , and antipain .
Fifty milliliters of the 0.42 m NaCl extract ( cor-responding to a 12-liter culture ] was loaded at a rate of 0.5 ml/ min onto a 10-ml wheat germ lectin column ( Sigma ; 5 mg lec-tin/ml of Sepharose GMB ) , which was equilibrated in buffer 7420 [ 420 mm KCI , 25 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 } , 12.5 mm MgCl , , 10 pm ZnCl , 0.1 % NP-40 , 20 % glycerol ] .
The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer 2420 and 20 ml of buffer Z50 ( as 7420 , except for 50 mm KCl ) .
Glycosylated proteins were eluted 1604 GENES & DEVELOPMENT with 0.3 m N-acetyl-glucosamine in buffer Z50 .
A BSAP -specific DNA affinity column was prepared by coupling a DNA fragment containing 16 multimerized H2B-2.2 TSAP-binding sites { Barberis et al .
1989 ) to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B ( Sigma ) .
The eluate of the lectin column was applied to 1 ml of this DNA affinity resin , which was equilibrated in buffer A50 containing 50 mm KCl , 25 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 5 mm EDTA , and 0.1 % NP-40 .
The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A50 , and BSAP was eluted with buffer A500 ( as A50 , except for 500 mm KCI } .
The eluted material from four different preparations ( corre-sponding to ~50 liters of BJA-B cells ) was concentrated 5- to 10-fold by lyophilization , precipitated with chloroform-etha-nol , and dissolved in 100 pl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride .
This material was diluted fivefold into 1 % TFA in water and loaded onto a C8 reverse-phase HPLC column ( Nucleosil 300-5C8 ) .
A 60-raol linear gradient of acetonitrile ( 0O-100 % acetonitrile in 0.1 % TFA ) was applied at 1 ml/min .
The BSAP peptide eluted in 58 % acetonitrile and was purified further on a prepar-ative 10 % SDS-polyacryamide gel , followed by blotting onto an Immobilon-P membrane ( Millipore } and Coomassie blue stain-ing .
The 50-kD band corresponding to ~5 pg of BSAP protein was excised and subjected to trypsin digestion .
Individual peptides isolated by reverse-phase HPLC fractionation were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems pulsed liquid phase sequena-tor ( type 477A ) .
BSAP activity was followed throughout the entire purification procedure by EMSA .
However , 50 ug of BSA was added as carrier protein to the binding reaction ( 20 wl ) to titrate the nonionic detergent NP-40 away from BSAP .

RNA preparation and PCR cloning Total RNA was prepared from mouse embryos , adult tissues , and B-lymphoid cell lines by the method of Chirgwin et al .
{ 1979 } , and polyadenylated RNA was selected by three runs of oligo ( dT } -cellulose chromatography .
Poly { A ) *® RNA ( ~5 mg ) from BJA-B cells , 702/3 cells , mouse kidney , and E10.5 embryos was transcribed into cDNA by Moloney muring leukemia virus ( M-MuLV ) reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript ; BRL } , and 100 ng of cDNA was used for 35 cycles of PCR amplification { 1 min at 94°C ; 2 min at 55°C ; 4 min at 72°C ) .
The BSAP paired domain DNA probe was amplified from BJA-B cDNA with oligonucleotides a and b , the entire mBSAP-coding region from cDNA with oligonucleotides c and d , mPax-1 from cDNA of day 10.5 embryos with oligonucleotides e and f , and mPax-8 from adult kidney cDNA with oligonucleotides g and h.

Recombinant phages ( ~2 x 10° ) of each library were screened with a °°P-labeled BSAP paired domain DNA probe .
Positive clones were rescreened and plaque purified .
The EcoRI cDNA inserts were subcloned into the expression vector pKW10 .
DNA sequencing The human BSAP-1 cDNA was cloned in both orientations into the polylinker of pUC19 and resected with exonuclease III from the Xbal site .
The sequence of the resected cDNA inserts was determined on an automated sequencer [ Applied Biosystem , model 373A ) .
Both strands of the mouse cDNA clones mBSAP-1 and mBSAP-2 were sequenced by the standard dideoxy tech-nique .
81 nuclease and RNase protection analyses S1 nuclease and RNase protection analyses were carried out according to Busslinger et al .
( 1981 ) and Vitelli et al .
( 1988 ) , respectively .
The mouse CD19 SP6 probe has been described by Kozmik et al .
( 1992 ) , and the mouse BSAP SP6 probe was generated by cloning a 195-bp Pvull-Sall fragment of mBSAP-1 cDNA in the antisense orientation into the polylinker of pSP64 .
The S1 probe for detecting murine $ 16 mRNA was obtained by S'-end-labeling of a 425-bp EcoRV fragment of plasmid pS16cDNA ( Wagner and Perry 1985 ) .
The S1 probe for detection of immunoglobulin x transcripts was a 5'-end-labeled 210-bp Styl-Kpnl fragment from the mouse c , gene .
BSAP expression in COP-8 cells and in vitro protein-DNA-binding assays The eukaryotic expression vector pKW 10 is derived from pRKS5 ( R. Klein and D. Goeddel , unpubl . )
by replacing the SV40 control region with a 380-bp Sau3A-EcoRl fragment of plasmid pPyoriAB ( Weichselbraun et al .
1989 ] containing the replication origin of polyoma virus .
The transcription unit of pKW1O consists of the CMV enhancer-promoter region , a leader sequence interrupted by an intron , a multiple cloning site , and the S¥40 polyadenylation signal .
cDNA expression plasmids ( 2-4 pg ] were transfected into COP-8 cells { Tyndall et al .
1981 ) on 90-mm tissue culture dishes by use of the DEAE-dextran method .
Two days later , the transfected cells were harvested and lysed in 50 wl of a buffer containing 420 mm NaCl , 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 25 % glycerol , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , 1 mm DTT , 0.5 % NP-40 , and the protease inhibitor cocktail described above .
EMSAs and methylation interference experiments were performed as described by Barberis et al .
( 1989 ) , except that 20 ug of BSA was also included into the binding reaction .
Quantitative electrophoretic gel-shift assays COP-8 cell extracts were diluted to 0.1 pug/pul of total cellular protein in buffer D containing 20 mm KCI , 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 } , 20 % glycerol , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm DTT , 5 ug/ml of BSA , and 0.1 mm PMSF .
One microliter of this diluted extract , 0.5 fmole of labeled probe , decreasing amounts of specific competitor DNA { starting with 1 pmole in twofold dilution steps } , and 1 ug of the nonspecific competitor DNA poly { d { I-C ) ] were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in 20 pl of a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 } , 100 mm KCI , 4 % Ficoll , 1 mm EDTA , and 1 mm DTT .
Following gel electrophoretic separa-tion , the two signals corresponding to protein-bound and free oligonucleotides were quantitated on a PhosphorImager { ( Molec-ular Dynamics ) , and the molar concentrations of bound [ PD , } The paired domain transcription factor BSAP and unoccupied ( D , ) specific sites were calculated , knowing the total amount of specific sites used in each reaction .
