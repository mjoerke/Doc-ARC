We have developed a novel assay to monitor the active , GTP-bound form of Rap1l based on the differential affinity of Rap1lGTP and RaplGDP for the Rap binding domain of RalGDS ( RBD ) .
Stimulation of blood platelets with or other platelet activators caused a rapid and strong induction of Rapl that associated with RBD ir vitro .
Binding to RBD increased from undetectable levels in resting platelets to > 50 % of total Rapl within 30 s after stimulation .
An increase in the intracellular Ca** concentration is both necessary and sufficient for Rapl activation since it was induced by agents that increase intracellular Ca * and inhibited by a Ca**-chelating agent .
Neither inhibition of translocation of Rap1 to the cytoskeleton nor inhibition of platelet aggregation affected thrombin-induced activation of Rap1 .
In contrast , prostaglandin I ; , ( PGI ) , a strong negative regulator of platelet function , inhibited agonist-induced as well as -induced activation of Rapl .
From our results , we conclude that Rapl activation in platelets is an important common event in early agonist-induced signalling , and that this activation is mediated by an increased intracellular Ca+* concentration .
Keywords : calcium/GTPase/platelet/Rap1/thrombin Introduction Rap1A and Rap1lB are two members of the Ras family of small GTPases .
RaplA was first identified both by its homology to Ras and as the product of a cDNA that induces flat revertants of K-ras-transformed cells ( Krey-1 ) .
Rap1B is a very close relative of Rap1 A , differing in only nine amino acids predominantly in the C-terminal part of the protein ( Noda , 1993 ) .
The functional difference between the two proteins is unclear and in most studies no discrimination between the two has been made .
Various functions of Rapl have been described , some of which are related to the ability of Rap1 to counteract the function of Ras .
For instance , introduction of the active , GTP-bound form of Rapl1 into fibroblasts inhibits Ras-mediated activation of MAP kinase ( Cook et a/. , 1993 ) .
In addition , constitutively active Rapl can inhibit Ras-mediated induction of germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus oocytes 252 ( Campa et al.,1991 ) .
In vitro Rapl binds regulators ( p120®S4 '' ; Frech et al. , 1990 ; Hata et al. , 1990 ) and effectors ( Rafl , RalGDS ; Spaargaren and Bischoff , 1994 ; Nassar et al. , 1995 ; Wittinghofer and Herrmann , 1995 ) of Ras , suggesting that the inhibition of Ras function is due to sequestration of Ras effectors by Rapl .
Interestingly , cAMP , an inhibitor of Ras signalling in various cell types ( Burgering et al. , 1993 ; Cook et al. , 1993 ; Wu et al. , 1993 ) , has been reported to induce the activation of exogenously expressed epitope-tagged Rapl in a Ras-transformed fibroblast ( Altschuler et al. , 1995 ) .
However , not all effects of Rapl point to an inhibition of Ras signalling and indicate that Rapl has a separate function in various cell types .
For instance , in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts , constitutively active Rapl induces DNA synthesis ( Yoshida et al. , 1992 ) .
In neutrophils , Rapl is found in association with the NADPH oxidase system ( Quinn et aZ. , 1989 ) , and introduction of Rap1 into neutrophil-like HL60 cells results in a stimulation of this oxidase ( Gabig et al. , 1995 ) .
Also , in blood platelets , Rapl may play an important role , since Rap1 , in particular Rap1B , is highly expressed ( Torti and Lapetina , 1994 ) .
Platelets are anuclear cell fragments that adhere to sites of injury in a blood vessel and aggregate to stop bleeding .
Adhesion and aggregation are accompanied by a profound change in the morphology of platelets due to remodelling of the actin-based cytoskeleton ( Hartwig , 1992 ; Fox , 1993 ) .
Thrombin is the most potent stimulator of platelets , but a large number of other activators has been described ( Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ; Siess , 1989 ) .
When platelets are activated , Rap1 is translocated to the platelet cytoskeleton ( Fischer et al. , 1990 , 1994 ) .
This translocation is a relatively slow process that depends on aggregation of platelets .
In addition , it has been reported that Rapl associates with p120®*°* '' and PLCYy ; after platelet stimulation ( Torti and Lapetina , 1992 ) .
Also , prostaglandin I ; ( PGI ; ) , a strong negative regulator of platelet function , affects Rapl by inducing the phosphorylation of a serine residue at the C-terminal end of Rapl ( Kawata et al. , 1989 ; Siess et al. , 1990 ) .
This phosphorylation induces a translocation of Rapl from the plasma membrane to the cytosol ( Lapetina et al. , 1989 ) .
Despite all these results , it is still unclear what the function of Rapl is and in which signal transduction pathway Rapl is involved .
This is partly due to the lack of information on signals that may activate endogenous Rapl , i.e .
induce the conversion of the inactive GDP-bound form of the protein to the active GTP-bound form .
Unfortunately , no antibodies are available that can immunoprecipitate Rapl to measure the ratio of GTP : GDP bound to Rap1 .
Therefore , we have developed an altern-ative , indirect assay to measure Rapl activation .
This assay is based on the differential affinity of Rap1GTP versus Rap1GDP for the Rap binding domain of RalGDS © Oxford University Press ( RBD ) as shown by Wittinghofer and co-workers ( Herrmann et al. , 1996 ) : whereas the Rap binding domain of RalGDS binds to the GTP-bound form of Rapl with a very high affinity ( K , =10 nM ) , the affinity for the GDP-bound form is undetectably low .
Here we report that in platelets ( -thrombin stimulation results in a dramatic increase of Rapl which can associate with RBD in vitro , indicating an increase of Rapl in the GTP-bound state .
We have investigated this activation further and found that most , if not all , activators of platelet function activate Rap1 , whereas the negative regulator PGI ; inhibits Rapl activation .
Furthermore , we show that an increase in the intracellular Ca* '' +* concentration is both necessary and sufficient to activate Rapl .
Finally , we show that Rapl activation occurs independently of , and probably prior to , platelet aggregation and the association of Rapl with the cytoskeleton .
From these results , we conclude that Rapl is activated rapidly and strongly by Ca**-mediated signalling after platelet stimulation , suggesting a critical role for Rapl in platelet activation .
Results & -Thrombin induces rapid activation of Rap1 Freshly isolated human platelets were stimulated with & -thrombin for various time periods and lysed .
Rapl was precipitated with the polyhistidine-tagged Rap binding domain of RalGDS ( RBD ) bound to nickel beads and identified by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody directed against Rap1 .
This antibody is specific for Rapl , and does not recognize Ras or R-ras ( not shown ) .
A rapid and strong increase in the amount of Rapl that bound to RBD in vitro was observed ( Figure 1A ) .
This increase was visible within 5 s after thrombin addition and reached its maximum level at ~30 s. At this latter time point , > 50 % of total Rapl could be precipitated with RBD ( Figure 1B ) .
Since RBD associates exclusively with the GTP-bound form of Rapl in vitro , with no detectable affinity for the GDP-bound form of Rapl ( Herrmann et al. , 1996 ) , we conclude that induces a rapid conversion of the majority of Rapl to the GTP-bound , active state .
Treatment of platelets with agonists other than -thrombin ( Benton et al. , 1982 ; Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ; Siess , 1989 ; Inazu et a/. , 1991 ) also caused activation of Rapl1 ; the thrombin receptor-activating peptide ( TRAP ) , collagen , the thromboxane A ; , ( TxA ; , ) analogue U46619 , ADP and platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) all induced rapid and strong Rapl activation ( Figure 2 ) .
Wheat germ agglutinin and lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) treatment also resulted in Rapl activation ( data not shown ) .
From these results , we conclude that Rapl is activated rapidly and strongly by signalling events common to most , if not all platelet agonists .
Rap1 activation occurs independently of secretion and platelet aggregation During thrombin-induced platelet activation , TxA , and ADP are released by platelets .
Both act in positive feedback loops to enhance further the ongoing platelet activation ( Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ; Siess , 1989 ) .
As TxA , and ADP induce Rap1 activation , we investigated whether thrombin-induced Rapl activation is a consequence of these pro Rap1 activation in platelets ~ .

Rapl activation is induced by different platelet agonists .
Platelets were stimulated for 1 and 3 min with ( 0.1 U/ml ) , TRAP ( 10 uM ) , collagen ( 5 ug/ml ) , the thromboxane A ; analogue U46619 ( 1 uM ) , ADP ( 10 uM ) and PAF ( 200 nM ) .
Resting platelets were treated with buffer for 3 min .
Rapl was isolated and identified as indicated in the legend to Figure 1. cesses .
Treatment of platelets with indomethacin inhibits TxA , formation ( Shen and Winter , 1977 ) ; addition of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase ( PEP : PK ) scavenges ADP , thus inhibiting ADP signalling ( Ammit and O'Neill , 1991 ; Van Willigen et al. , 1996 ) .
Addition of both inhibitors together , at concentrations causing complete inhibition of both pathways , resulted in only a partial inhibition of Rapl activation ( Figure 3 ) .
From these results , we conclude that although both TxA , and ADP do contribute to thrombin-induced activation of Rap1 , they are not essential for thrombin to induce Rapl .
Previously , it was shown that Rapl translocates to the platelet cytoskeleton in a mainly aggregation-dependent manner ( Fischer et al. , 1994 ) .
We therefore investigated the effects of disruption of the cytoskeleton and inhibition of platelet aggregation on thrombin-induced Rapl activ- 253 B.Franke , J.-W.N.Akkerman and J.L.Bos + inhibitors - inhibitors 60 30 10 5 1 0 1 5 10 30 60 time ( sec ) *t =~ sume —- ‘ - ’ ‘ _ Rap1 Fig .

Rapl activation occurs independently of both TxA ; formation and ADP secretion .
In the lanes marked '+ inhibitors ' platelets were incubated with 30 M indomethacin for 10 min to inhibit TxA ; formation .
In the last minute , the ADP scavenger system phosphoenolpyruvate : pyruvate kinase ( PEP : PK ) was added at a final concentration of 0.28 mM PEP and 3 U/ml PK .
Subsequently , the platelets were incubated with 0.1 U/ml ¢-thrombin for the indicated time periods , and Rap1 was isolated and detected as indicated in the legend to Figure 1 .
Control platelets ( - inhibitors ) were treated with 0.1 U/ml only .
ation .
Treatment of platelets with cytochalasin D prevents activation-dependent actin polymerization and remodelling of the cytoskeleton ( Dash et al. , 1995 ) .
This treatment totally prevented the translocation of Rapl to the cytoskeleton ( Figure 4A ) .
Cytochalasin D , however , did not affect thrombin-induced activation of Rapl ( Figure 4B ) , showing that Rapl activation occurs independently of translocation to the cytoskeleton .
Furthermore , in platelets that were not allowed to aggregate by the addition of the RGDS peptide , which blocks integrin function ( Hynes , 1992 ; Calvete , 1994 ) , Rapl activation was not impaired ( Figure 5 ) .
Also , inhibition of aggregation by not stirring the platelet suspension did not affect o-thrombin-induced activation of Rapl ( data not shown ) .
From these results , we conclude that Rapl activation occurs independently of Rapl translocation to the cytoskeleton and of platelet aggregation .
Increase in intracellular Ca '' * is necessary and sufficient for Rap1 activation One of the signalling events shared by platelet agonists is the activation of phospholipase C ( PLC ) , which releases diacylglycerol ( DAG ) to activate protein kinase C ( PKC ) , and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate ( InsP ; ) to mobilize Ca** from intracellular stores ( Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ; Siess , 1989 ) .
Figure 6A demonstrates that inhibition of PLC by U73122 ( Okamoto et al. , 1995 ) strongly reduced thrombin-induced activation of Rapl , suggesting that either PKC or Ca** is an important factor in Rapl regulation .
We therefore tested whether an increase in the intracellular Ca** concentration is important for the activation of Rap1 .
Inhibition of the cytosolic Ca** increase by chelation of intracellular Ca*+* with BAPTA-AM ( Watson et al. , 1995 ) completely blocked activation of Rapl by a-thrombin .
On the other hand , increasing the concentration of intracellular Ca '' + with ionomycin ( Cavallini and Alexandre , 1994 ; Doni et al. , 1994 ) or thapsigargin ( Authi et al. , 1993 ; Cavallini et al. , 1995 ) strongly activated Rapl ( Figure 6A ) .
This indicates that an increased level of Ca** is both necessary and sufficient to activate Rap1 .

Inhibition of actin polymerization prevents Rapl translocation but does not affect thrombin-induced activation of Rap1 .
Platelets were treated with cytochalasin D ( Cyto D , 5 ug/ml ! )
( top ) or DMSO ( bottom ) 5 min prior to stimulation with 0.2 U/ml ¢-thrombin for the indicated time periods under aggregating conditions ( stirring ) .
( A ) Cytoskeletal proteins were isolated as described in Materials and methods .
Amounts of protein representing 3X 10 '' platelets were used for protein immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody directed against Rap1 .
( B ) Rapl was precipitated with RBD and analysed as indicated in the legend of Figure 1 .
The band present above Rapl is caused by aspecific binding to the Ni**-NTA-agarose beads .
of TxA , or secretion of ADP , since inhibitors of both signalling events , indomethacin and PEP : PK , caused only a slight reduction of Ca**-induced Rap1 activation ( Figure 6A ) .
Moreover , this reduction is probably due to the slightly lower Ca*+* level induced by thapsigargin and ionomycin in the presence of indomethacin and PEP : PK ( data not shown ) .
Inhibition of PKC by several inhibitors , i.e .
staurosporin , bisindolyImaleimid and calphostin C ( Tamaoki , 1991 ; Toullec et al. , 1991 ) , did not at all or only marginally affect the activation of Rapl by o-thrombin ( Figure 6B ) .

Inhibition of platelet aggregation does not affect thrombin-induced activation of Rap1 .
Platelets were treated with 0.1 U/ml under aggregating conditions for the indicated time periods in the presence ( +RGDS ) or absence of 100 uM of the aggregation-inhibitory peptide RGDS added 1 min prior to activation .
Rapl was precipitated with RBD and analysed as indicated in the legend to Figure 1. ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ; Siess , 1989 ) activated Rapl only slightly and after a prolonged period of time ( Figure 6B ) .
From these results , we conclude that Rapl activation is mediated by an increase in intracellular Ca** , which is both necessary and sufficient , whereas activation of PKC does not play an essential role .
Prostaglandin I ; ( PG I ; ) inhibits thrombin- and Ca * -induced Rap1 activation PGI ; , a potent inducer of cAMP production , is a strong antagonist of platelet activation ( Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ; Siess , 1989 ) .
We therefore tested the effect of PGI ; on thrombin-induced activation of Rapl .
Figure 7A shows that addition of PGI ; inhibited thrombin-induced activation of Rapl completely .
Furthermore , when platelets were first treated with thrombin and subsequently with PGT , the initial activation of Rapl was followed by a rapid down-regulation ( Figure 7B ) .
Interestingly , the activity of Rapl ( again ) correlated with the level of intracellular Ca++ ( Figure 7C ) .
However , Ca**-induced activation of Rapl by thapsigargin and ionomycin was also fully blocked by PGI ; ( Figure 7D ) , even though the intracellular Ca** levels induced by thapsigargin or ionomycin were still high in the presence of PGI ; ( data not shown ; Siess and Lapetina , 1989 ; Nakamura et al. , 1995 ) .
These results show that Rapl activity is under tight negative control of PGI , which acts both upstream and downstream of Ca** .
PGI ; activates adenylate cyclase resulting in an increase in the cAMP level .
It is intriguing that Rapl is an in vivo substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) ( Kawata et al. , 1989 ; Siess et al. , 1990 ) .
This phosphoryl-ation , which results in a lower electrophoretic mobility of Rapl ( Siess et al. , 1990 ; Siess and Grinberg , 1993 ) , occurs only slowly and was still very limited 2 min after PGI ; treatment of the platelets ( Figure 8A ; Griinberg et al. , 1995 ) .
At this time point , however , PGI ; had already completely inhibited Rapl activity ( see Figure 7A ) .
Furthermore , was able to activate phosphorylated Rapl1 apparently normally .
This was shown by pre-treating platelets with PGI ; for various times , followed by thrombin stimulation : whereas platelets became fully responsive to thrombin stimulation within 60 min after PGI ; addition ( due to the instability of PGI ) , Rapl phosphorylation remained high ( Figure 8A ; Siess and Griinberg , 1993 ; Rap1 activation in platelets ; “ a= as dB -- am 4- Rapl B A C x A\ .

Role of PLC , Ca** and PKC in @ -thrombin-induced Rap1 activation .
( A ) U73122 and BAPTA-AM inhibit Rapl activation , whereas ionomycin and thapsigargin stimulate it .
Platelets were incubated with either the PLC inhibitor U73122 ( 1 uM , 3 min ) or the intracellular Ca** chelator BAPTA-AM ( 30 uM , 30 min ) prior to 1 min of thrombin ( 0.1 U/ml ) stimulation .
In addition , platelets were activated in the absence of thrombin with either ionomycin ( 100 nM ) + CaC ] ; ( 1 mM ) or thapsigargin ( 100 nM ) , both for 1 min .
In the lanes labelled 'onomycin + inhibitors ' and 'thapsigargin + inhibitors ' platelets were pre-treated with inhibitors of TxA ; production and ADP signalling ( as indicated in the legend to Figure 2 ) prior to 1 min of treatment with either ionomycin + CaC ] ; or thapsigargin .
Rapl was precipitated with RBD and analysed as indicated in the legend to Figure 1 .
The band present above Rapl on the blot is caused by aspecific binding of protein to the Ni_*-NTA-agarose beads .
( B ) Inhibition or activation of PKC do not significantly affect Rapl activity .
Platelets were incubated with the PKC inhibitors staurosporin ( 1 uM , 5 min ) , bisindolyImaleimid ( 5 uM , 1 min ) , calphostin C ( 5 M , 5 min ) prior to a 1 min thrombin stimulation ( 0.1 U/ml ! )
( left panel ) .
In the right panel , platelets were stimulated with the PKC-activating phorbol ester PMA ( 10 nM ) for 1 and 3 min .
Rapl was precipitated with RBD and analysed as indicated in the legend to Figure 1 .
Griinberg et al. , 1995 ) .
Under these conditions , thrombin activated the phosphorylated , shifted form of Rap1 ( Figure 8B ) .
We conclude , therefore , that the PGI ; -induced inhibition of Rapl activation is not caused by phosphorylation of the GTPase .
Discussion We have developed a novel assay to identify the active GTP-bound state of Rapl .
This assay is based on the observation that the GTP-bound form of Rapl associates 255 B.Franke , J.-W.N.Akkerman and J.L.Bos with the RBD of RalGDS with high affinity in vitro , whereas no interaction can be detected with the GDP-bound form of Rap1 .

& _ , p , p & 256 with polyhistidine-tagged RBD bound to Ni° : *-NTA-agarose beads , we observed a large amount of Rapl associated with RBD only in stimulated platelets .
Based on the in vitro binding affinity , we conclude that this increase is due to an induction of the GTP-bound form of Rapl by a-thrombin .
Alternatively , Rapl might be constitutively GTP-bound but complexed to a factor in resting platelets that prevents it from associating with RBD .
Stimulation with thrombin would then lead to dissociation of this factor , rendering Rapl available for RBD binding .
To discriminate between the two possi-bilities , the ratio of GDP and GTP bound to Rapl in platelets needs to be measured .
Unfortunately , suitable antisera for Rapl immunoprecipitation , which are essential for such an experiment , are still not available .
Irrespective of this , in functional terms there may be no difference between the two mechanisms , as both result in free GTP-bound , active Rapl .
The assay was used to monitor the activation of Rapl in platelets .
We observed that all agonists tested that activate platelets also activate Rap1 .
This could imply that Rapl is either involved in a signalling pathway common to all of these agonists or that Rapl activation is a secondary event , induced by positive feedback loops ( TxA , release and ADP secretion ) or by platelet aggregation , for instance .
However , inhibition of both TxA , production and ADP signalling as well as aggregation did not affect O-thrombin-induced activation of Rapl significantly .
This strongly suggests that Rapl activation is one of the early events in platelet activation .
The observed translocation of Rapl1 to the cytoskeleton is not involved in the activation of Rap1 , since it occurs much later than Rapl activation .
Furthermore , inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D , which totally blocked Rapl association with the cytoskeleton , did not inhibit Rapl activation .
Therefore , we conclude that Rapl is involved in a signalling pathway common to all agonists tested .
A common denominator for all these agonists is the increase in intracellular Ca*+* by mobilization of Ca** from internal stores and by influx of extracellular Ca** .
Indeed , we found that increasing the concentration of intracellular Ca** with either ionomycin or thapsigargin induced Rapl Fig .

Effects of PGI ; treatment of platelets on Rap1 activation and cytosolic Ca* levels .
( A ) PGI ; pre-treatment prevents Rapl activation by o-thrombin .
Platelets were treated with thrombin ( 0-T , 0.1 U/ml ) , in the presence or absence of PGI added 2 min earlier at 10 ng/ml .
Rapl was precipitated with RBD and analysed as indicated in the legend to Figure 1 .
( B ) PGI ; treatment of o-thrombin-activated platelets results in a time-dependent reduction of Rap1 activity .
Platelets were treated with & -thrombin ( 0.1 U/ml ) for 15 s to activate Rap1 .
PGI ; ( 10 ng/m ! )
was then added for the indicated times .
Controls were either left untreated or were activated with o-thrombin for 120 s to serve as a positive control for the activity state of Rapl at the end of the experiment .
Rapl was precipitated with RBD and analysed as indicated in the legend to Figure 1 .

PGI ; -induced phosphorylation of Rapl does not affect Rapl activation .
( A ) PGI ; induces a mobility shift of Rap1 .
Total lysates of platelets treated with PGI ; ( 20 ng/m ! )
for the indicated time periods were separated and analysed by protein immunoblot analysis for the presence of phosphorylated Rap1 .
The phosphorylated form of Rapl shows decreased electrophoretic mobility during SDS-PAGE and can therefore be detected as a second Rapl1 band on the immunoblot , indicated by Rap1-P. ( B ) « -Thrombin induces activation of phosphorylated Rap1 .
Platelets were treated with PGI ; ( 20 ng/m ! )

As a control , platelets incubated with PGI ; were not incubated with thrombin Rapl was precipitated with RBD and analysed as indicated in the legend to Figure 1 .

At all later time points , PGI ; has been broken down and platelets have restored responsiveness to & -thrombin ( Siess and Lapetina , 1990 ; Siess and Griinberg , 1993 ) .
activation .
In addition , BAPTA-AM , which chelates intracellular Ca** , inhibited thrombin-induced Rapl activation .
Apparently , Rapl activation is mediated by a rise in intracellular Ca** .
The mechanism by which the Ca '' + increase results in Rapl activation , however , is unclear and currently under investigation .
PGI ; , which activates adenylate cyclase to increase the levels of cAMP in platelets , inhibits thrombin-induced activation of Rap1 .
This is in agreement with the observation that PGI ; inhibited thrombin-induced increases in intracellular Ca** .
However , thapsigargin- or ionomycin-induced activation of Rapl was also inhibited by PGI , indicating that the antagonist also affects a factor downstream of Ca+* .
Although Rapl is phosphorylated after PGI ; treatment of platelets , it is unlikely that this phosphorylation causes the inhibition .
We conclude this from the observation that ( 1 ) PGI ; -induced phosphorylation of Rapl was a much later event than inhibition of Rap1 , and ( ii ) thrombin could activate the phosphorylated form of Rapl1 .
It should be noted here that the detection of the phosphorylated form of Rapl by a mobility shift is an accurate method , as it has been shown by others that PGI ; -induced phosphorylation invariantly is accompanied by the shift in mobility ( Siess et al. , 1990 ) .
Another Rap1 activation in platelets candidate for mediating the PGI ; inhibition is Rap1lGAP .
Phosphorylation of this protein is induced by elevated levels of cAMP , at least in insect cells and the SK-MEL-3 cell line ( Polakis et al. , 1992 ; Rubinfeld et al. , 1992 ) .
Whether this occurs in platelets and whether it affects GAP activity is still unknown .
It should be noted that phosphorylation of Rap1 correlates with the PGI ; -induced translocation of Rapl from the plasma membrane to the cytosol ( Lapetina et al. , 1989 ) .
This translocation may be another form of inactivation by PGI » , which clearly interferes at a different level of Rap1l-mediated signalling .
From the rapid activation of a major fraction of Rapl and the stringent control of Rapl activity by PGI » , we anticipate that Rapl plays a critical role in agonist-induced , calcium-mediated events in platelet activation .
Interestingly , Ca**-induced signalling is involved in the activation of integrin oilIbB3 , resulting in the exposure of binding sites for fibrinogen and , subsequently , platelet aggregation ( Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ; Siess , 1989 ) .
It is tempting , therefore , to speculate that Rapl1 is involved in this process .
Support for this possibility comes from the recent finding that R-ras , a close relative of Rapl , is involved in the activation of integrins in various cell lines ( Zhang et al. , 1996 ) .
A function of Rapl in the activation of integrins is not incompatible with the flat revertant phenotype of Kreyv-1/Rapl in transformed fibroblasts .
Materials and methods Production of his-tagged RalGDS-RBD The cDNA encoding the 97 amino acids spanning RBD was isolated from pGEX-RGF97 ( Herrmann et al. , 1996 ) as a BamHI-Xhol fragment .
The BamHI site was blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase .
Subsequently , the fragment was inserted into the pET-15b vector ( Novagen ) digested with NdeI ( and blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase ) and Xhol .
The construct was transformed into Escherichia coli ( strain BL21 ) .
Protein production was initiated by addition of isopropyl B-p-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) to the culture .
The fusion protein was affinity purified on a column ( Qiagen ) from the supernatant of bacteria lysed by sonication and freeze-thaw cycles in a sucrose-containing buffer .
Isolation and stimulation of platelets Freshly drawn venous blood from healthy volunteers ( with informed consent ) was collected into trisodium citrate ( 0.1 vol .
of 130 mM trisodium citrate ) .
The donors claimed not to have taken any medication during the previous 10 days .
The blood was centrifuged at 200 g for 15 min at room temperature to yield platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) .
Then , 0.1 vol .
of ACD ( 2.5 % trisodium citrate , 1.5 % citric acid , 2 % p-glucose ) was added to the PRP to lower the pH of the plasma to 6.5 and thus prevent platelet activation during further isolation .
Platelets were purified from PRP by centrifugation at 700 g for 15 min at room temperature .
The platelet pellet was resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 137 mM NaCl , 2.68 mM KCI , 0.42 mM NaH , PO , , 1.7 mM MgCl , , 11.9 mM NaHCO ; , pH 7.4 ) containing 5 mM p-glucose at 2 X 10° platelets/ml .
Platelets were left at room temperature for at least 30 min to ensure a resting state .
Samples of 0.5 ml were used for the experiments .
Purified platelets were incubated in a lumiaggregometer ( CHRONO-LOG corporation ) at 37°C .
In the standard assay , incubation with agonists was without stirring .
Without stirring , platelets only change their shape but do not aggregate , whereas in a stirred suspension ( 900 rp.m . )
platelet shape change and aggregation occur .
Platelet agonists used in the study are : -thrombin which was added to the platelets for 1 min at a final concentration of 0.1 , 0.2 or 0.25 U/ml ( as indicated ) , TRAP ( 6mer : SFLLRN ) ( 10 uM ) , collagen ( 5 ug/ml ) , U46619 ( TxA ; analogue ) ( 1 uM ) , ADP ( 10 uM ) and PAF ( 200 nM ) .
PMA was added to the platelets at a final concentration of 10 nM , thapsigargin , an inhibitor of intracellular Ca** ATPases , was used at 100 nM concentration as was jonomycin , a Ca** ionophore .
In the 257 B.Franke , J.-W.N.Akkerman and J.L.Bos case of ionomycin , 1 mM CaCl ; was added to the platelet suspension just prior to stimulation .
PGI ; was used at a concentration of 10 or 20 ng/ml and incubated with the platelets for 2 min ( unless indicated otherwise ) .
The PLC inhibitor U73122 ( 1 uM ) was present during 3 min pre-incubation .
The inactive component U73343 used as control had no effect on Rapl activity ( data not shown ) .
BAPTA-AM ( 30 M ) , an intracellular Ca** chelator , was pre-incubated with the platelet suspension for 30 min .
Indomethacin ( 30 uM ) was added to the platelets for 10 min to inhibit TxA ; formation .
The ADP scavenger PEP : PK was freshly prepared prior to every experiment and added to the platelets at a final concentration of 0.28 mM PEP and 3 U/ ml PK 1 min before stimulation .
PKC inhibitors were used as follows : staurosporin ( 1 uM ) , 5 min incubation , bisindolylmaleimid ( 5 uM ) , 1 min incubation , calphostin C ( 5 M ) , 5 min incubation .
Cytochalasin D was added to the platelet suspension at a concentration of 5 ug/ ml 5 min prior to platelet stimulation .
The peptide RGDS was used at a concentration of 100 uM and was added to the platelets 1 min prior to stimulation .
RGDS binds to the ligand binding site of the platelet integrin olIbB3 .
It inhibits binding of fibrinogen to the integrin and therefore blocks platelet aggregation .
RGDS does not activate outside-in signalling of integrin allbB3 ( Hynes , 1992 ; Calvete , 1994 ) .
Rap1 activation assay using RalGDS-RBD Platelets were lysed by addition of 1 vol .
of cold 2X RIPA lysis buffer [ 150 mM NaCl , 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 , 2 % NP-40 , 1 % deoxycholic acid ( DOC ) , 0.2 % SDS , 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 2 uM leupeptin , 2 M aprotinin ] to the platelet suspension .
Lysis was performed at 4°C for 10-30 min .
Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at maximal speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C .
Five ug of RalGDS-RBD coupled to Ni°*-NTA-agarose beads ( Qiagen ) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4°C for 30-90 min with slight agitation .
Beads were washed four times in 1X RIPA .
After the final wash , Laemmli sample buffer was added to the samples .
Next , proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvi-nylidene difluoride membranes ( Immobilon-P , Millipore ) .
The antibody used specifically to detect Rapl was a monoclonal antibody directed against Rapl ( Transduction Laboratories ) .
Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
All experiments shown here were performed at least three times with the same result to exclude donor-specific effects .
Calcium measurements PRP was prepared as described above .
ACD was added and platelets were incubated with 3 1M Fura-2-AM for 45 min at 37°C .
Surplus Fura-2-AM and plasma were removed by gel filtration over a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated in HEPES/Tyrode buffer .
Measurement of the cytosolic Ca** concentration was performed using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer by a dual wavelength program ( excitation was measured at 340 nm and 380 nm , emission at 510 nm ) .
Cell fractionation Samples of 5X10° platelets/ml were lysed in cold 2X CSK buffer ( 100 mM Tris-HCI , 20 mM EGTA , 2 % Triton X-100 , 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , 2 mM PMSF , 2 pg/ml aprotinin , 2 jig/ml leupeptin ) after stimulation .
Lysis was for at least 10 min at 4°C .
Lysates were centrifuged at maximal speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C .
The pellet containing the actin cytoskeleton of the lysed platelets was washed once with 1X CSK buffer and centrifuged as before .
Laemmli sample buffer was added to the pellet .
Amounts of protein representing equal numbers of platelets were used for SDS-PAGE .
