Despite their bipotential capacity , these progenitors develop predominantly to T cells in the thymus .
The mechanisms controlling this developmental choice are unknown .
Here we present evidence that a member ( s ) of the family of basic helix loop helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors determines lineage specification of NK/T cell progenitors .
The natural dominant negative HLH factor Id3 , which blocks transcriptional activity of a number of known bHLH factors , was expressed in CD34+* progenitor cells by retrovirus- mediated gene transfer .
Constitutive expression of Id3 completely blocks development of CD34 * cells into T cells in a fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .
In contrast , development into NK cells in an FTOC is enhanced .
Thus , the activity of a bHLH transcription factor is necessary for T lineage differentiation of bipotential precursors , in the absence of which a default pathway leading to NK cell development is cho-sen. O ur results identify a molecular switch for lineage specification in early lymphoid precur- sors of humans .
he earliest progenitor cells in the thymus have the ca pacity of developing into multiple hematopoietic lineages .
Upon further development within the thymus , these progenitor cells progressively lose their multipotentiality ( 1 ) .
There is considerable evidence that the human ( 2 ) and the mouse thymuses ( 3 , 4 ) contain bipotential T/ NK progenitors .
However , given the paucity of mature NK cells in the thymus , the thymic environment strongly favors development of these bipotential T/ NK progenitor cells into T cells The molecular mechanisms controlling T/ NK lineage specification in the thymus are not yet elucidated , but it seems fair to assume that this developmental choice is under transcriptional control .
Several transcription factors that orchestrate lymphoid development have now been identified in the mouse .
Ikaros is a key factor that affects development of all lymphoid ( T , NK , and B ) cells ( 5 ) .
Several other factors appear to be critical for development of specific lymphoid lineages like GAT A-3 ( 6 ) and TCF-1 ( 7 ) for T cells and Pax5 ( 8 ) , EBF ( 9 ) , Sox4 ( 10 ) , and the products of the E2A gene ( 11 , 12 ) for B cells The E2A proteins E12 and E47 belong to the family of basic helix loop helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors , which are involved in differentiation of many cell types 1597 ( 13 ) .
E12 and E47 probably regulate B cell development by controlling expression of immunoglobulin , RAG , and a number of B cell-specific genes including mb-1 , A5 , CD19 , and Pax5 ( 11 , 12 , 14 ) .
Transcriptional activity of bHLH factors is controlled by the inhibitor of DNA binding ( Id ) proteins .
This family of HLH factors comprises four members , Id1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , which are highly homolo-gous in their HLH domains and have distinct tissue distributions ( 15 , 16 ) .
Id factors can heterodimerize with bHLH factors , but lack a basic DNA binding domain , and therefore they block transcriptional activity by bHLH factors .
Constitutive overexpression of Id1 under control of a B cell-specific mb-1 promotor leads to inhibition of B cell development ( 17 ) , similar to the one observed in E2A-deficient animals ( 11 , 12 ) .
R ecent evidence has suggested a role for bHLH factors in development of T cells as well .
E2A-deficient mice were initially reported to have no gross abnormalities in T cell development , but the size of the thymus is smaller than that of wild-type animals ( 12 ) .
Mice deficient for another bHLH factor , HEB , displayed a partial block in T cell development at an early stage of development ( 18 ) .
Whether HEB and E2A deficiencies affect NK cell development is not known .

We have made use of retrovirus- mediated gene transfer to enforce expression of one of the Id proteins , Id3 , in CD34+* progenitors using a bicistronic vector harboring Id3 and the marker gene green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) .
Id3 can interact with a wide range of bHLH factors and blocks transcriptional activity of E12 , E47 , and HEB ( 19 ) .
We found that enforced expression of Id3 strongly inhibits development of CD34¢* progenitors to CD3¢* T cells in an in vitro fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) , but promotes development of NK cells .
Materials and Methods Construction of the V edtors and T ransduction of Target Cells .
Previously we have successfully used bicistronic vectors with a gene of interest linked to a downstream internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) and a marker gene that allow independent translation of the products of both genes in the transduced target cells ( 20 ) .
The IR ES-GFP sequence was ligated into the LZR S vector ( 21 ) , and a polylinker was placed downstream of the gag and upstream of the IRES sequences .
The Id3 coding sequence was cloned from the pCDN AId3 ( gift of Dr. C. Murre , University of California at San Diego , San Diego , CA ) plasmid by PCR using oligonucle-otide primers with appropriate linkers .
The product was ligated between the Xhol and SnaBI site of the polylinker from our plasmid LZR S-linker-IRES-GFP , to obtain the retroviral vector LZR S-Id3-IRES-GFP .
( A modified version of GFP [ enhanced GFP ] was used in this study and was obtained from Clontech , Palo Alto , CA . )
Helper-free recombinant retrovirus was produced after transfection into a 293T -based amphotropic retroviral packaging cell line , Phoenix ( 21 ) .
Purified CD34* cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 10 ng/ml human IL-7 and 10 ng/ml stem cell factor ( SCF ) ( both from R & D , Abingdon , UK ) .
The cells were then transduced by overnight incubation with virus supernatant in the presence of 10 ug/ml Dotap ( Boehringer Mannheim GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) .
Isolation of CD34* Cells from Fetal Liver and Postnatal Thymus .
- Fetal liver was obtained from elective therapeutic abor-tions .
Gestational age was determined by crown-rump length and ranged from 14 to 17 wk .
The use of this tissue was approved by the medical ethical committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute and was contingent upon informed consent .
Human fetal liver cells were isolated by gentle disruption of the tissue by mechanical means , followed by density gradient centrifugation over Fi-coll-Hypaque ( Lymphoprep ; Nycomed Pharma , Oslo , Norway ) .
The CD34* cells were isolated from these samples by immuno-magnetic cell sorting , using a CD34 separation kit ( varioMACS ; Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) and were further purified by sorting with a FAC Star plus® ( Becton Dickinson , San José , CA ) .
Postnatal thymus samples were from children undergoing open-heart surgery .
CD34* cells , enriched by immuno-magnetic cell sorting , were labeled with anti-CD34 ( HPCA-2 ; Becton Dickinson ) and anti-CD1a ( Coulter , Hialeah , FL ) antibodies and the CD34*CD1a~ cells were purified by FACS® sort-ing .
The purity of the populations used in this study was > 99 % .
Fetal Thymic Organ Cultures .
- In vitro development of human T and NK cells from CD34* fetal liver cells or thymocytes was studied using the hybrid human/mouse FTOC using fetal thymuses from embryos of R AG- 1-deficient mice as described ( 22 ) .
TCR-y/8* and NK cells were expanded in Yssels medium ( 23 ) 1598 from the FTOC cultures using a feeder cell mixture as described previously ( 24 ) .
NK Cell Assays .
10,000 CD34* sorted cells were cultured in Yssels medium in the presence of 10 ng/ ml SCF , 10 ng/ ml IL-7 , and 100 U/ml IL-2 ( Eurocetus , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) .
After 1 wk , cells were harvested , counted , and analyzed by FACS® , using anti-CD3 and anti-CD56 ( provided by Dr. J.H .
Phillips , DNAX , Palo Alto , CA ) .
The cytotoxic activity of NK cells was determined with a standard `` Cr-release assay using cells of NK-sensitive ( K562 ) and insensitive ( the EBV-transformed B cell line EBV225 ) cell lines as target cells .
Analysis of D-JB Rearngements .
D-JB rearrangements were determined by PCR as described previously ( 25 ) .
Primers and probes used for TCR-B rearrangement were : 5-TGGTGGTC-TCTCCCAGGCTCT-3 ' ( PDBI.1 ) , 5-CCAGCTGTCCAGC-CTTGACTT-3 ' ( JB1.3-1.4 ) and 5-CAAAGCTGTAACAT-TGTGGGGAC-3 ' ( DB , , probe ) .
To control for the amount of DNA in the PCR , genomic amplification of the RAG-2 gene was performed .
Primers and probe used were : 5-TGTGAATTGCA-CAGTCTTGCCAGG-3 ' ( RAG-2 sense ) , 5-GGGTTTGT-TGAGCTCAGTTGAATAG-3 ' ( RAG-2 antisense ) , and 5'-CAAGATATGGTTTGGAAGCAACATGGGAAA-3 '' ( RAG-2 probe ) .
Results and Discussion Enforced Expression of Id3 Inhibits Development of CD1a - Thymocytes , but Promotes NK Development in an FTOC .
To study the role of bHLH factors in T cell development , we overexpressed the dominant negative HLH protein Id3 in T cell progenitors and monitored the fate of the transduced cells .
Id3 has a very broad tissue distribution and CD34* fetal liver and thymic progenitor cells express Id3 messenger RN A as determined by reverse transcription PCR ( results not shown ) .
Purified CD34¢* fetal liver cells were cultured with a combination of SCF and IL-7 for 24 h. The cells were then transduced by overnight coculture with supernatants of packaging cells producing recombinant viruses harboring either Id3-IRES-GFP or IRES-GFP , and cultured in an FTOC for 4 wk ( 22 ) .
The flow cytometric analysis shown in Fig .
1 demonstrates that the GFP marker was transferred to 23 % of the progeny of the IR ES-GFP and 13 % of the Id3-IR ES-GFP-transduced progenitor cells .
The patterns of CD3 , CD4 , and CD5 stain-ings of the GFP * cells from the IR ES-GFP-transduced cells are identical to that of the nontransduced GFP- cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
The great majority of the GFP * cells express CD 1a , and very few CD56* cells were present in these samples .
By contrast , cells harvested from the FTOC with Id3-IRES-GFP-transduced fetal liver cells did not express CD1a , and 32 % of these cells were positive for the NK cell marker CD56 .
Almost no CD3* cells were observed ( Fig .
1 ) .
Not only the proportions of CD56* cells were different , but also the absolute numbers since > 30-fold more GFP*CD56* cells were found in the FTOC , populated with Id3-transduced CD34* cells .
These data indicate that CD34¢* fetal liver cells , overexpressing Id3 , develop preferentially into CD3-CD56¢* cells in the FTOC .
It was important to ensure that these GFP*CD3~CD56* cells represent functional NK cells .

Cell supensions were stained with the indicated TriColor ( TRC ) and PE-labeled antibodies and analyzed on a FAC Scan® .
Cell recoveries of both samples were 3 X 10 '' celly lobe .
Percentages of transduced cells 2 d after transduction were 25 % in both control- and Id3-transduced samples .
tolytic activity , we cultured the cells harvested from the FTOC with a feeder mixture consisting of irradiated PBMCs , the EBV cell line JY , PHA and IL-2 .
Under these conditions we can expand NK cells and TCR-y/8 , but not TCR - « / B cells from an FTOC ( 24 ) ; the failure to obtain TCR - « / B cells is because the mouse thymic environment is unable to induce functional maturation in these cells ( 24 ) .
Fig .
2 demonstrates that the GFP+ cells expanded from the control FTOC contained GPF* TCR y/8* cells and a few CD56*CD3~ cells .
By contrast , GFP* cells expanded from the FTOC with the Id3* progenitor cells were CD56* and did not express CD3 , underscoring the strong inhibitory effect of Id3 on generation of TCR cells The GFP*CD3~-CD56* cells were sorted from the Id3-IRES-GFP cultures and were shown to be highly cytotoxic for the NK sensitive target cell K562 , but not for an NK-resistant cell line ( Fig .
2 b ) .
These results confirm that the CD56*CD3-~GFP+* cells observed in these FTOC are functional NK cells .
The observation that the proportion of CD56* cells in the Id3-GFP+* progeny is much higher than in the control GFP progeny and in the Id3-GFP- cells in the FTOC is consistent with the notion that Id3 overexpression switches the cell fate of the bipotential thymic T/ NK progenitors .
An alternative possibility is that overexpression of Id3 con 1599 Heemskerk et al .

Percentages of GFP * 40 1 cells were 30 % for the Id3- and 40 % for the control-transduced cells .

To investigate this , we studied the effect of Id3 transduction on development of CD34+* fetal liver cells into NK cells in a mixture of SCF , IL-7 , and IL-2 ( 2 ) .
All cells generated from transduced CD34* fetal liver cells and cultured with the cytokines for 2 wk were CD3~ ( not shown ) .
In both Id3-IRES-GFP and the IRES-GFP cul-tures , we observed the same proportions of GFP+ cells ( 35 % ) and an identical distribution of CD56 in the IRES-GFP¢+* and the Id3-IR ES-GFP * cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , constitutive expression of Id3 in the CD34* fetal liver cells does not significantly enhance the percentage of NK cells that develop under the influence of SCF , IL-7 , and IL-2 .
This result makes it unlikely that the increase of NK cell numbers observed in the FTOC with Id3* progenitor cells is caused by improved survival or proliferation by Id3 over-expression .
TCR-B rearrangements are initiated in the CD1lat CD3~CD4-CD8~CD34* cells ( 25 , 26 ) .
Moreover , CD1at cells are unable to develop into NK cells ( 2 ) .
This suggests that upregulation of CD1a is correlated with T cell commitment .
If this is correct and if overexpression of Id3 inhibits T cell commitment , we should expect that CD1a~ CD34* cells transduced with Id3 fail to develop into T cells in an FTOC .
Purified CD1la~CD34¢* cells were cultured with SCF and IL-7 , transduced , and incubated in an FTOC for 3 wk .

CD34* fetal liver cells were isolated , transduced , and incubated with the cytokines for 14 d. CD34* cells is strongly reduced , whereas the proportion of NK cells is dramatically increased .
The absolute numbers of GFP+ NK cells in the Id3-transduced samples was 10-fold higher than in the GFP* cells in the control-transduced samples .
The inhibition of generation of CD3+* by Id3 is underscored by the almost complete absence of CD4¢* and CD4*CD8* in the cells expressing Id3-GFP .
The CD8+ cells observed in these cultures are CD3~CD56* cells .
The Id3-IRES-GFP*CD3-~CD56+* could be expanded with a feeder cell mixture and displayed cytolytic activity against K562 cells ( results not shown ) .
Enforced Expression of Id3 Inhibits Induation of D-JB Rear rangement by IL-7 and SCF .
T cells are defined by TCR gene rearrangements ; in NK cells , these genes are in the germ line configuration ( 1 ) .
The fact that Id3 inhibits generation of CD3 * cells and stimulates that of NK cells , raises the possibility that bHLH factors are required for processes that result in TCR rearrangements .
To test this , we cultured transduced CD1a~-CD34¢* and CD1atCD34* cells for 7 d in IL-7 and SCF , sorted GFP+ and GFP- cells , and analyzed for the presence of D-JB rearrangements with a sensitive PCR technique ( 25 ) .
Fig .
5 shows that Id3 completely blocked IL-7 and SCF-mediated induction of D-JB rearrangement in CD1a~-CD34* cells .
One trivial explanation for this observation is that SCF and IL-7 induce growth of a very small population of contaminating CD1atCD34+* cells that have already undergone D-JB rearrangements ; overexpression of Id3 could inhibit the growth of these contaminating cells This is unlikely because D-JB rearrangements were still detectable in Id3-transduced CD1atCD34+* cells recovered after 7 d of culture ( Fig .
5 ) .
The ratios of the intensities of the bands hybridized with the D-JB and genomic DNA control ( R AG-2 ) probes in the starting CD1a* CD34* ( lane 4 ) and in the Id3-CD1atCD34* ( lane 6 ) populations were the same .
This ratio is increased in the un-transduced CD1atCD34* cells These data indicate that IRES-GFP Id3-IRES-GFP Figure 4 .

It appears , therefore , that Id3 overexpression inhibits induction of D-JB rear-rangement .
It remains to be determined whether the rearrangement process itself is blocked or whether an earlier step is inhibited .
Our results raise the possibility that the SCF receptor ( ckit ) and/ or the IL-7R communicate with bHLH factors as suggested previously ( 14 ) .
The Role of bHLH Fadors and Id Proteins in T Cell Development .
- The results presented here indicate that bHLH proteins are involved in T cell commitment .
The critical role of these factors in T cell commitment is comparable to that of E2 A proteins in commitment of B cells ( 14 ) and emphasizes the similarities of the mechanisms of early B and T cell development ( 27 ) .
Several bHLH factors , including E2 , HEB , and E2-2 , can be inhibited in their action by overex- pression of Id3 .
Mice with a targeted E2A null mutation that have no B cells were initially reported to have no apparent gross abnormalities in distribution of double negative ( DN ) , double positive ( DP ) , and mature thymocytes ; however , the thymi of these mice are relatively small ( 11 , 12 ) .
A more recent analysis of the effect of E2A deficiency on T cell development has revealed that the proportion of DP cells in the thymus of E2A~'~- mice is lower than in wild-type or heterozygous '* mice .
Within the DN population , an accumulation of CD44*CD25~ cells and relatively few CD44 '' CD25 +cells was observed ( 28 ) .
Thus it appears that E2A deficiency results in a partial inhibition of the CD25~ to CD25* transition .
Most interestingly , this transition is equivalent to the CD1a~ to CD1at transition in humans ( Blom , B. , P.C.M .
Res , and H. Spits , manuscript in preparation ) that is blocked by Id3 .
HEB may be another target for Id3 .
Zhuang et al .
observed accumulation of DN and less DP thymocytes in the thymus of HEB- ' - mice ( 18 ) .
Expression of the CD3-TCR complex on the thymocytes and spleen cells of the HEB-deficient mice was not analyzed , leaving the developmental stage that is blocked unresolved .
It is possible that HEB , E2A , and perhaps other bHLH factors collaborate in inducing T cell development , and that a complete inhibition ensues when these factors are simultaneously inhibited by overexpression of Id3 .
Thus , T cell development may be dictated by a combined dosage of several bHLH factors .
It is in this respect noteworthy that B cell development appears to be regulated by the combined dosage of E2A , HEB , and E2-2 proteins ( 18 ) .
Future studies should provide more exact information about which bHLH factors are critical for T cell development and which genes are controlled by these factors .
