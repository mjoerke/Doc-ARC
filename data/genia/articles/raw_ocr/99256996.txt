This triggering leads to exocytosis of the cytotoxic NK cell granules .
The oncoproteins c-Myc and E1A render cells vulnerable to NK cell mediated cytolysis yet the mechanisms of sensitization are not well understood .
In a model where foreign cells ( rat fibroblasts ) were cocultured with human IL-2 activated NK cells , we observed that NK cells were capable of efficiently killing their targets only if the cells overexpressed the oncogene c-Myc or EIA .
Both the parental and the oncogene expressing fibroblasts similarly triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the bound NK cells , demonstrating that NK cells were cytolytically activated in contact with both resistant parental and oncogene expressing sensitive target fibroblasts .
The cell death was independent of wild-type pS3 and was not inhibited by an anti-apoptotic protein E1B19K .
These results provided evidence that c-Myc and E1A activated the NK cell induced cytolysis at a post-triggering stage of NK cell-target cell interaction .
In consistence , the c-Mye and E1A overexpressing fibroblasts were more sensitive to the cytolytic effects of isolated NK cell-derived granules than parental cells .
The data indicate that oncogenes activate the cytotoxicity of NK cell granules .
This mechanism can have a role in directing the cytolytic action of NK cells towards the virus-infected and cancer cells .
Keywords : apoptosis ; c-Myc ; ElA ; NK cells ; cytotoxicity Introduction Natural Killer ( NK ) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that express a pattern of antigens different from T and B cells and do not rearrange their T cell receptor or immunoglobulin genes .
NK cells are spontaneously cytotoxic to many virus-infected cells and tumor cell targets , but the molecular mechanisms which direct the NK cell cytotoxicity towards these cells are not well understood .

This initial binding phase together with positive and negative signals that the NK cells receive from target cells determine the activation of the NK cell cytolytic machinery .
The triggering of NK cell cytotoxicity is not dependent on the recognition of foreign peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules .
In fact , the NK cell cytolytic activity is negatively regulated by inhibitory NK cell receptor molecules that recognize MHC class I molecules on target cells ( Lanier , 1997 ) .
The MHC-based control of NK cell activity is thought to protect normal cells In contrast , transformed or virally infected cells which downregulate MHC expression , are sensitive to cytolysis ( Brutkiewicz and Welsh , 1995 ; Ljunggren and Kirre , 1990 ) .
Receptors that trigger NK cell activity are less well characterized , but include at least Fce-receptor-type III or CD16 , C-type lectin receptors , killer cell activating receptors ( KARs ) and B2 ? -integrins ( Helander et al. , 1996 ; Raulet and Held , 1995 ) .
Triggering of NK cell cytolytic machinery results in the directed exocytosis of cytotoxic granules ( Berke , 1994 ) .
These granules are the primary mediators of NK cell cytotoxicity , and the major granule components involved in the cytotoxic process are a membrane pore-forming protein called perforin and serine proteases called granzymes .
Perforin is required for the activation of apoptosis by granzyme B and the translocation of granzyme B to the target cell nucleus ( Jans et al. , 1996 ; Shi et al. , 1997 ) .
NK cells can induce target cell death also by ligand mediated activation of CD95 on target cells ( Arase et al. , 1995 ) .
Part of the NK cell killing activity against tumor cells is due to the membrane bound or soluble forms of tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF ) ( Wright and Bonavida , 1987 ) .
The oncogenic expression of c-Myc ( Versteeg et al. , 1989 ) or adenoviral E1A ( Walker et al. , 1991 ) increases the susceptibility of target cells to lysis by NK cells .
This effect may be mediated by several mechanisms .
In melanoma cell lines c-Myc overexpression downregu-lates MHC class I expression and sensitizes the cells to NK cytolysis ( Peltenburg et al. , 1992 ; Versteeg et al. , 1989 ) .
The sensitization can be reversed by reintroduc-tion of MHC class I molecules by transfection .
In other types of cells , c-Myc increases the sensitivity of target cells to NK cell-induced lysis without altering MHC class I expression , possibly by increasing the adhesive-ness of NK cells to the targets ( Cuomo et al. , 1993 ; La c-Myc and ELA induced sensitivity to NK cell cytotoxic granules J Klefstrom et al 2182 Cava et al. , 1994 ) .
Thus , the expression of oncogenes can have effects on the target cell surface which facilitate the triggering of the cytolytic machinery of NK cells during NK cell-target cell interaction .
c-Myc or EIA could also induce target cell sensitivity to NK cell cytotoxicity by increasing their sensitivity to TNF-mediated killing mechanisms ( Chen et a/. , 1987 ; Klefstrom et al. , 1994 ) .
In certain instances , antibodies blocking TNF inhibit the ElA-induced sensitivity of mouse fibroblasts to mouse NK cell cytotoxicity ( Cook et al. , 1989 ) .
Recent data indicate that c-Myc and ElA can also induce the cellular sensitivity to CD95 ligand ( CD9SL ) -induced death ( Cook et al. , 1996 ; Hueber et al. , 1997 ) .
Here we present evidence that in addition to the so far described mechanisms of sensitization , oncogenes also have a role at a post-triggering stage of the cytolytic action of NK cells .
The present results show that the oncogenes c-Myc and EIA sensitize cells to apoptosis by NK cell derived cytotoxic granules and the dependence of granule mediated cell death on this sensitization .
Results c-Myc and ElA induce susceptibility of Rat1 fibroblasts to cytolysis by IL-2 activated NK cells We studied if oncoproteins can modulate target cell sensitivity to NK cell killing in a model where NK cells were expected to recognize target cells as foreign cells and expose them to cytolytic attack .
Therefore , we applied a xenogeneic cell model in which Ratl fibroblasts were used as targets of human NK cells .
Ratl cells , or their derivatives constitutively overexpressing E1A ( Rat1-E1A ) or c-Myc ( Rat1-Myc ) were cocultured either with human NK cells or with interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) activated human NK cells for 3 days .
A rapidly progressing cell death of c-Myc or ElA overexpressing Ratl cells occurred in cultures with IL-2 activated NK cells ( Figure la ) , whereas clearly less cell death occurred in cocultures with parental Ratl cells .
Most of the oncogene expressing target cells died during 24 h of culture , whereas parental Ratl cells survived over the 3 day assay period .
The in sity DNA nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) revealed specific staining of fibroblastic cells with an apoptotic morphology ( Figure 1b ) .
Upon quantitation by the MTT assay it was found that the Rat1-Mye and Rat1-El1A cells died in a logarithmic fashion in response to increasing amounts of IL-2 activated NK cells ( Figure 1¢c ) .
The 4:1 effector target ratio resulted in less than 20 % relative survival of these cells .
Higher ratios of IL-2 activated NK cells to Ratl1 cells resulted in a decreased cell survival , yet more than half of the parental Ratl cells survived even the highest NK cell ratios analysed ( 16:1 ) .
The cell death is independent of wild-type p53 activity and is not inhibited by an adenoviral anti-apoptotic protein EIBIIK The apoptotic functions of c-Myc ( Wagner et al. , 1994 ) and EIA ( Debbas and White , 1993 ) are often manifested only in cells that express wild-type p53 .
Ratl cells express wild-type p53 and its role as a mediator of c-Myc or ElA induced cellular susceptibility to NK cell cytolysis was studied .
The carboxyterminal transforming domain of p53 , ( pS53Cter , p53 residues 302-390 , see Shaulian et al. , 1992 ) was introduced into Ratl , Ratl-ElA and Ratl-Mye cells .
p53Cter forms stable heteromeric complexes with the wild-type p53 .
This inhibits the wild-type p53 activity since heteromeric complexes can not activate transcription ( Shaulian et al. , 1992 , 1995 ; ) .
Consistent with the dominant-negative role of p53Cter in Ratl cells , the expression of pS53Cter reduces the rate of p53-dependent , X-irradiation induced apoptosis to one fifth of that of the control cells ( Klefstrom et al. , 1997 ) .
IL-2 activated NK cells killed Ratl-Mye and Ratl-E1A cells expressing p53Cter with a similar efficiency as they killed parental oncoprotein expressing cells .
In both cases the 4:1 ratio of effector cells to target cells resulted in less than 20 % relative survival of the target cells ( Figure 2 ) .
We also tested if EIBI9K , an adenovirus-encoded inhibitor of apoptosis , modulated the E1A-induced NK cell sensitivity of Ratl cells .
The Ratl cells expressing both EIA and El1BI9K were killed as efficiently as Ratl cells expressing ElA alone ( Figure 2 ) .
Both the NK cytotoxicity-resistant Ratl cells and the oncoprotein expressing cytotoxicity-sensitive Ratl cells bind NK cells and induce F-actin polarization and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the bound NK cells The adhesion assays showed that NK cells bound to their targets and that the binding was similar to Ratl , Ratl-EIA and Ratl-Myc cells ( Figure 3a ) .
Further-more , IL-2 treatment increased the binding of NK cells to all target cells in a similar fashion .
The fluorescence microscopy of phalloidin-stained , target bound NK cells revealed prominent actin polymerization to F-actin form at the cell-cell contact sites ( Figure 3b ) .
The actin polarization , which indicates the cytolytic activation of killer cells ( Berke , 1994 ; Griffiths , 1995 ) , was commonly found also in NK cells bound to Ratl cells , which were resistant to NK cell-induced death ( Figure 3b ) .
Next , we measured the amount of cellular inositolphosphates whose increased generation by phosphoinositide hydrolysis occurs during the exocytosis of the cytotoxic granules ( Atkinson et al. , 1990 ; Chow and Jondal , 1990 ; Stahls and Carpen , 1989 ) .
Incubation of NK cells with the parental Ratl cells or with the EIA or c-Myc overexpressing Ratl cells resulted in a similar increase of cellular inositolmono-phosphate ( inositol-P1 ) levels ( Figure 3¢c ) ; the increase was 4.7 , 4.1 and 3.6-fold after incubation with Ratl , Ratl-E1A or Rat1-Myc cells , respectively .
c-Myc and ElA enhance cellular susceptibility to the lethal effects of purified cytotoxic granules The accumulation of inositolphosphates and the frequently observed F-actin polarization in NK cells indicated that all target cells activated the NK cell cytolytic machinery in a similar fashion .
Therefore , we tested if c-Myc or ElA sensitized Ratl cells to the lethal effects of purified cytotoxic granules .

When the integrity of cell membranes was examined by trypan blue exclusion in a 6 h assay , Ratl-E1A and Ratl-Myc cells were more sensitive than Ratl-pMV7 cells to the membrane damaging effects of RNK-granules ( Table 1 ) .

Inhibition of cell death was quantitated by measuring the relative increase of OD540 value in the MTT-assay .
IL-2 activated NK cells were incubated for 1 h with different concentrations of blocking antibody against TNF ( R & D Systems ) .
Control cultures were incubated with equivalent concentrations of mouse IgG .
After the incubation , NK cells were added to target cells in 4:1 ratio and MTT-assays were performed .

In control cultures the IgG antibodies inhibited about 3-6 % of cell deaths ( data not shown ) .
Squares represent the survival of the TNF-sensitive WEHI-164§ cells , which were used to control the blocking capacity of the anti-TNF antibody .
TNF was incubated for 1 h with the blocking antibodies prior addition to the WEHI-164 $ cells in a final concentration of 10 ng/ml TNF contributed to the cytotoxic activity of NK cells ( Aversa et al. , 1993 ) .
The blocking efficiency of the anti-TNF antibody was controlled in TNF cytotoxicity assays using highly TNF-sensitive WEHI-164S8 cells .
The anti-TNF antibody did not have a significant effect on the death of Ratl-Myc or Ratl-ElA cells in the cocultures ( Figure 4 ) but it completely blocked TNF-induced death of WEHI-164S cells Western blot analyses with the CD9S-antibody show that Ratl cells express CD95 ( Hueber et al. , 1997 ) .
To test if Ratl cells were sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of CD95L , the cells were treated with soluble CD95L and the ensuing apoptotic cell deaths were scored by time-lapse videomicroscopy .
Soluble CD95L did not induce apoptosis in the cultures of Ratl or Ratl-El1A cells .
However , Rat1-Myc cells were susceptible to apoptosis by CD9SL ( Figure 5a ) .
To evaluate the role of CD9SL in the killer cell induced death of Ratl-Myc targets , we used IL-2 activated killer cells derived from the spleens of gid mice as effectors .
These cells have a loss-of-function mutation in the CD95SL-gene .
As controls , we used killer cells from the spleens of normal mice of the same strain .
Both the normal and the gid mouse-derived killer cells , above the 10:1 effector cell : target cell ratio , killed more efficiently Ratl-Mye cells than Ratl cells ( Figure 5b ) .
Discussion Oncogenes c-Myc and ElA promote cell proliferation but exert at a same time destructive effects for cells by sensitizing them to various triggers of apoptosis .
For example , cells which survive in the presence of the proapoptotic cytokines TNF and CD95L , die by these cytokines if the oncogenic activity of c-Myc is turned on in the cells ( Hueber et al. , 1997 ; Klefstrom et al. , 1997 ) .
c-Myc and ElA also sensitize cells to lysis by NK cells .
The oncogene expression have effects on the target cell surface which may facilitate the triggering of the cytolytic machinery of NK cells .

prior to the addition on target cells .

The results represent the mean of two separate experiments tize cells to NK cell mediated lysis yet it does not exclude the involvement of other mechanisms downstream the cytolytic pathway .
We addressed the question whether a link exists between the oncogene-induced NK cell sensitivity and the susceptibility of oncogene expressing cells to the cytolytic proteins of NK cells .
The rat fibroblasts were cocultured with human NK cells .
Due to the species difference the cytolytic activity of human NK cells could not be affected by MHC on rodent Ratl cells ( Gumperz and Parham , 1995 ) .
Therefore , we expected that NK cells would recognize both parental and oncogene expressing target cells as foreign cells and expose them to cytolytic attack .
We observed that IL-2 activated NK cells bound to parental and oncogene-expressing Ratl cells in a similar manner and the cytolysis-associated , F-actin enriched contact sites were formed .
These NK cells were also cytolytically activated in contact with resistant parental as well as sensitive oncoprotein expressing Ratl cells as demonstrated by quantitative analyses of phosphoinositide hydrolysis .
This suggested that the difference in the susceptibility between parental and oncoprotein expressing Ratl cells receded within the post-triggering phase of NK cell-target cell interaction .
In this regard our results are in agreement with recent results showing that EIA expression increases the sensitivity of NIH3T3 fibroblasts to cytotoxic lymphocytes in a manner that is not dependent on the type of target cell recognition mechanism used ( Cook et al. , 1996 ) .
Consistent with the hypothesis that cell death was determined at the post-triggering phase , we found that both the EIA and c-Myc overexpressing Ratl cells were more sensitive to the cell membrane damaging and apoptosis-inducing effects of the purified cytotoxic granules than the control Ratl cells .
TNF and CD95L , both expressed by NK cells , can also mediate NK cell induced cell death .
However , our experiments with the blocking antibodies against TNF and with the CD9SL-deficient mouse killer cells showed that the block or absence of these molecules did not block the c-Myc effect on cell death .
Thus , the present data indicate that the NK cell granules were the primary mediators of the NK cell cytotoxic effects towards the oncogene-expressing targets .
It has been previously shown that cells may differ in their susceptibility to the lytic effects of NK cell derived granules ( Chow , 1990 ; Khalil et a/. , 1990 ) , yet the factors that determine the susceptibility have not been identified .
This study links the action of E1A and c-Myc to the increased susceptibility of cells to the lytic effects of the granules .
However , the possible interaction mechanisms between granular effector proteins and c-Myc or EIA remain to be clarified .
Mitogenic stimulation of fibroblasts by growth factors increases their sensitivity to the lethal effects of purified cytotoxic granules ( Khalil et al. , 1990 ) .
Thus , the cell growth promoting functions of c-Mye or E1A may be involved in the induction of Ratl cell sensitivity to the granule proteins .
Exposure of cells to perforin and granzyme B activates prematurely the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase p3MACDC2 ( Shi et al. , 1994 ) .
It is possible that the granule proteins and c-Myc or E1A co-operatively activate central cell cycle molecules which may , when activated 'out-of-phase ' with the cell cycle , have apoptotic functions .
On the other hand , granzymes A ( Irmler et al. , 1995 ) and B ( Darmon et al. , 1995 ; Irmler et al. , 1995 ; Shi et al. , 1996 ) are capable of activating cellular caspases , on which most if not all types of apoptotic cell death pathways converge .
Overexpression of c-Myc or ElA could increase the expression or lower the threshold of activation of these basic effector proteins of the apoptotic machinery .
Indeed , extracts from ElA expressing cells but not from normal cells spontaneously activate caspases in a cell-free system ( Fearn-head et al. , 1997 ) .
The molecular composition of this oncogene-generated activity is as yet uncharacterized , but it is tempting to speculate that it involves central molecules of apoptosomes - multiprotein assemblies thought to be crucial sites of caspase activation in cells .
For example , activation of caspase 9 is dependent on the formation of a protein complex involving the nematode Ced4-like protein Apaf-1 , mitochondria- 2185 c-Myc and ELA induced sensitivity to NK cell cytotoxic granules J Klefstrom et al 2186 derived holo-cytochrome c and deoxyadenosine tripho-sphate ( Li et al. , 1997 ) .
Oncogenes could prime apoptosomes either by increasing the level of activators or decreasing the level of suppressor proteins in these assemblies .
Therefore , sensitivity of oncogene expressing cells to proapoptotic insults like TNF receptor or Fas ligation , cytotoxic drugs or , as we show here , to cytotoxic granules may in general reflect the increased readiness of apoptosomes to fire in these cells .
We noted that the ElA-induced NK -sensitivity was not inhibited by adenoviral anti-apoptotic protein E1B19K , which is a viral analogue of Bcl2 .
This is in agreement with available data showing that also Bel2 is unable to protect cells from NK-lysis ( Sutton et a/. , 1997 ) .
In contrast , the c-Myc induced susceptibility to TNF or CD95L mediated killing is inhibited by Bcel2 in Ratl cells ( Hueber et al. , 1997 ; Klefstrom et al. , 1997 ) .
These data argue that c-Mye and EIA induce sensitivity to at least two types of apoptotic path-ways : ( i ) to the death receptor-dependent pathway which is upstream of Bcl2 or E1B19K and ( ii ) to the granule-dependent pathway which is either separate of former or downstream of it .
In addition to the anti-apoptotic proteins , the loss-of wild-type p53 activity renders cells resistant to various inducers of apoptosis-providing a plausible explanation for the commoness of p53 mutations in cancer ( Levine , 1997 ) .
The present data suggest that the wild-type activity of p53 is not necessary for c-Myc or EIA induced sensitivity to the cytotoxic granule-induced death .
In addition , we have noticed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in p53 or Friend Leukemia Virus induced cell lines not expressing p53 as a result of viral integration in both p53 alleles are completely susceptible to granzyme B and perforin mediated apoptosis ( L Shi and AH Greenberg , unpublished data ) .
Apparently the cytolytic factors of cytotoxic granules , once activated by oncogenes , bypass the common blocks of apoptosis in tumor cells or in cells infected with oncogenic viruses .
The results shown dissociate the triggering of the cytolytic machinery from the cytolytic action of the NK cells .
We hypothetize that at least in some cases the triggering of the cytolytic machinery of NK cells delivers a cytolytic challenge rather than a cytolytic hit to target cells .
Thus , the exocytosis of the NK cell granules does not necessarily represent the point-of-no-return to the target cells The target cell specific determinants such as oncogenes can play an essential role in the activation of the cytotoxicity of the granules .
This mechanism would perfect the selectivity of the cytotoxic action of NK cells ; it protects normal cells and enhances the cytolytic action towards the virus-infected and cancer cells .

In short , leukocyte rich buffy coats were obtained from the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service .
The mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Isopaque density-gradient centrifugation ( Pharmacia ) followed by filtration through nylon-wool columns to remove adherent cells .
NK cells were further enriched by two step Percoll density gradient centrifugation followed by immunomagnetic removal of T cells , B cells and monocytes ( CD3- , CD19- , CD14-Dynabeads ) .
In FACS analysis 90+ 5 % of the remaining cells were CD56 positive and CD3 negative NK cells with less than 5 % contaminating T or B cells or monocytes .
Mouse lymphocytes were isolated from the spleens of 9 week-old C3H/Hej mice or of same age C3H/Hej gid mice .
The mice-strains were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory .
Isolation of cytoplasmic granules from RNK cells Rat natural killer ( RNK ) large granular lymphocytic leukemia cell granules were isolated as described ( Shi et al. , 1992 ) .
One ml of granules was equivalent to 1x 10° RNK cells .
MTT Cell viability assay Cell survival was quantitated by a colorimetric MTT assay , which measures mitochondrial activity in viable cells .
For assays 5000 target cells/well were seeded on 96-well plates ( Nunc ) .
After overnight adherence , the effector cells were added on the target cells .
Each assay was set up in triplicate wells .
After a 48 h incubation period 10 ul of MTT from a 5 mg/ml stock solution was added into each well and the plates were further incubated for 4 h at 37°C .
The reaction was terminated by adding 100 ul of lysis buffer ( 10 % SDS , 10 mm HCl ) .
The resulting formazan products were solubilized overnight at 37°C in a humid atmosphere , after which the absorbance at 540 nm was measured with a Multiscan microtiter plate reader ( Labsystems ) .
The percentage of surviving cells was defined using the formula [ ( experimental-blank1 ) / ( control-blank2 ) ] x 100 where the 'experimental ' is the absorbance value of effector-target cell cocultures and 'blank1 ' the absorbance of the effector cells .
The 'control ' is the absorbance value of the target cells and 'blank ? '
of the culture medium .
Tunel staining of apoptosis For TUNEL-staining , target cells were grown on uncoated coverslips in 24-well plates .
The effector cells were added on the target cells at ratio 1:1 and after incubation the coverslips were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde .
The TUNEL staining was performed as described earlier ( Klefstrom et al. , 1994 ) .
Assays of granule cytotoxicity For trypan-blue exclusion assays , 50 000 cells/well were seeded on 96-well plates .
After overnight adherence , the culture medium was replaced with HH-BSA ( Hank 's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES , 2 mM CaCl , and 4 mg/ml BSA , pH 7.4 ) .
The RNK granules were diluted in HE-Na buffer ( 10 mm HEPES , 1 mM EGTA , 140 mm NaCl , pH 7.4 ) and added to the target cells .
At defined time-points both the adherent and non-adherent cells of each well were pooled and the percentage of trypan blue staining cells was determined by microscopy .
Each assay was set up in duplicate wells .
For propidium-iodide ( PI ) staining , cells were grown on 0.05 % poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips in 35-mm dishes for 2 days prior to the assay .
The RNK granules were diluted in HE-Na buffer and added to the target cell cultures whose culture medium , prior granule-addition , was replaced with HH-BSA .
At the indicated time points , coverslips were picked up and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
To score apoptotic cells on the coverslips , the fixed cells were incubated for 20 min in PI solution ( 50 ug/ml PI and 1 mg/ml RNaseA in PBS ) , washed with PBS and mounted with glycerol-PBS for immunofluorescence microscopy .
The condensed and fragmented apoptotic nuclei formed bright fluorescent images and were distinguishable from the round and dim normal nuclei .
The ratio of apoptotic and non-apoptotic nuclei was scored by counting 200-1000 nuclei per coverslip .
Generation of inositolphosphates The generation of inositolphosphates in NK cells was measured as described ( Stahls and Carpen , 1989 ) .

Nature , 378 , 245-248. c-Myc and ELA induced sensitivity to NK cell cytotoxic granules J Klefstrom et al NK cells ( 10x 10° cells/ml ) were incubated for 20 h in inositol free culture medium ( RPMI 1640 sine inositol , Gibco ) , containing 1 % of HSA , 300 IU/ml IL-2 and 35 uCi/ml [ HJinositol .
Cells were washed and kept thereafter in inositol-free culture medium containing 1 % HSA and 10 mM LiCl to inhibit the activity of inositol-1-phosphate phosphatase .
Target cells ( 7x 10° cells ) were mixed with ' H-inositol labelled NK cells in a 1:1 ratio after which the cell suspensions were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and analysed immediately ( negative control ) or after a 15 min incubation at 37°C .
Inositolphosphate metabolism was terminated by adding methanol/chloro-form ( 2:1 ) followed by chloroform/water ( 1:1 ) to the cell suspensions .
The water-soluble inositolphosphates were separated and fractionated on MonoQ anion-exchange ( FPLC ) system ( Pharmacia ) with a continuous gradient of 0-O0.1 M ammonium formate .
One ml fractions were collected and the radioactivity was measured with a beta counter ( LKB-Wallac ) .
