L. , C. P. ] and Department of Virology [ E. P. ] , Istituto Superiore di Sanita , 00161 Rome , Italy Abstract The TAL-1 gene specifies for a basic domain-helix-loop-helix protein , which is involved in the control of normal hematopoiesis .
In human pathology , the TAL-I gene product is expressed in a high percentage of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias in the pediatric age range ; however , it has not been established whether the expression has a causal role in oncogenesis .
In this report , we describe the phenotype of mouse transgenic lines obtained by inducing tal-1 protein expression in lymphoid tissues using the LCK promoter , The survival rate of tal-1 transgenic animals was much lower as compared with control mice .
Histopathological analysis revealed lymphomas of T-cell type , often comprising a minor B-cell component .
Some mice showed marked splenic lymphocyte depletion .
Primary lymphocyte cultures showed partial independence from exogenous growth stimuli and increased resistance to low-serum apoptosis .
To further unravel the tal-1 oncogenic potential , a strain of tal-1 transgenic mice was crossbred with p53~'~ mice ; the survival rate in these animals was reduced by more than one-half when compared with that of tal-1 mice , and histopathological analysis revealed exclusively T-cell lymphomas .
These data indicate that TAL-1 , expressed in T cells , is per se a potent oncogene , which may exert a key leukemogenetic role in the majority of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias .
Introduction Transcription factors are often involved in tumorigenesis ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
The TAL- ] gene ( also known as SCL or TCL-5 ) , identified by analysis of t ( 1 ; 14 ) ( p32 ; q11 ) translocations in human T-ALL , ° codes for the tai-1 protein belonging to the family of bHLH domain transcription factors ( 3-5 ) , which are involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation ( 6 ) .
The TAL-/ gene , although silent in normal adult T lymphocytes ( 7 , 8 ) , is constitutively activated in a high percentage of T-ALL by various mechanisms ; these include chromosomal translocation , which has been reported in only 3 % of T-ALL , or cis events , i.e. , specific interstitial chromosomal deletions affecting the 5 ' noncoding region of TAL- ] leading to transcriptional activation of the gene in approximately 25 % of T-ALL ( 9 , 10 ) .
Furthermore , a recent study has shown that TAL- ] is abnormally expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T-ALL ; a trans-acting event may explain the active TAL-/ transcription in T-ALL cases without apparent TAL-/ gene alteration ( 11 ) .

TAL-1 seems to be abnormally expressed in > 60 % of T-ALL cases ( 11 ) .
In normal tissues , tal-1 expression is restricted to hematopoietic CD34 * progenitor cells and erythroid , megakaryocytic , and masto-cytic lineages ( 12-14 ) .
The absence of tal-1 determines a block of early blood cell formation ( 15 , 16 ) involving all hematopoietic and lymphoid lineages ( 17 ) .
Furthermore , tal-1 favors erythroid development , whereas its expression is shut off in granulopoietic differentiation ( 14 ) .
The main structural feature of the tal-1 protein is the bHLH motif , which includes both DNA binding and dimerization domains ; particularly , the TAL-/ bHLH motif has a high degree of homology ( 84 % ) with the bHLH domains of LYL-/ and TAL-2 , two other genes occasionally activated by chromosomal translocation in T-ALL ( 18 , 19 ) .
In vitro studies have shown that the tal-1 protein heterodimerizes with products of the £24 gene ; the heterodimer preferentially binds to a sequence containing an E-box consensus motif ( 20 , 21 ) .
In vivo tal-1 and E2A protein heterodimers are present in T leukemic ( 22 , 23 ) and normal erythroid cells ( 14 ) .
The role of tal-1 in leukemogenesis is still debated .
In fact , it has been reported that targeted expression of tal-1 in T cells through a transgene under a CD2 enhancer and the strong SRa viral promoter does not cause tumors ( 24 ) .
We show here that in transgenic mice , TAL-1 driven by the LCK promoter is a potent oncogene able to induce T-cell malignant tumors .
These , as well as other in vitro results ( 25 ) , suggest a causal role of TAL- ] expression in T-ALL leukemo-genesis .
Materials and Methods Transgenic Mice C57BL/6 mice and p53 homozygous recombinant mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) and Taconics/GenPharm International ( Mountain View , CA ) , respectively .
All animals were bred and maintained in a pathogen-free environment at Jefferson Medical College , Thomas Jefferson University .
All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee , and NIH guidelines for animal care were followed throughout .
The construct LCK-TAL-1 was generated by insertion of a 1.2-kb fragment containing the coding region and a 3 ' untranslated region of human TAL-/ cDNA ( 5 ) .
The TAL-1 cDNA was rendered BamHI-compatible on both ends and inserted into the unique BamHI cloning site downstream to the LCK promoter ( 26 ) .
The 3 ' untranslated portion of this construct encompasses introns , exons , and polyA addition sites from the human growth hormone gene .
The 6.8-kb LCK-TAL-1 fragment digested by SaclIl was used for microinjec-tion .
Transgenic animals were generated according to standard procedures ( 27 ) .
Transgenic progeny were identified by Southern blotting of Sacl-digested tail DNA using the entire LCK-TAL-1 fragment as a probe .

protein in the thymus and spleen ( Fig .
2B ) ; the expression in the thymus is higher than in the spleen , consistent with the difference in T-cell number in these organs .
In fact , LCK is expressed at higher level in immature than mature T cells ( 30 , 31 ) .
Ectopic tal-1 Forms a DNA Binding Complex with E2A Protein in Lok-tal-1 Mice .
It has been shown both in vivo and in vitro that tal-1 has the ability to bind DNA only when it associates with E2A protein ( 14 , 20 , 21 ) .
Furthermore , we observed that in diverse cell lines , ectopic expression of the TAL-/ gene product exerts both proliferative and antidifferentiative effects , which depend on both the basic and HLH domains ( 25 ) necessary for binding to DNA and E2A protein , respectively .
To investigate whether tal-1 expressed in T cells was able to form a complex with E2A protein and bind efficiently to its DNA consensus sequence , EMSA was performed with total extracts obtained from thymus or spleen of transgenic mice ( Fig .
3 ) .
In the spleen , a band closely comigrates with the canonical tal-1/E2A protein complex in Jurkat cells ; in thymus , this band was more clearly visible , together with an additional faster migrating band , whereas no protein complex was detectable in control mice ( Fig .
3A ) .
To confirm whether the components of this complex included tal-1 and E2A proteins , nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-tal-1 ( spleen and thymus ) or anti-E2A serum ( thymus ) , and EMSA was performed ( Fig .
3B and results not shown ) .
In both cases , the bands corresponding to the tal-1/E2A complex were either decreased or supershifted , thus showing the presence of these proteins in the nuclear complex .
The intensity of the radioactive bands was higher in the thymus than in the spleen , thus in agreement with Western blot results ( Fig .
3A ) .
Effects of tal-1 Expression on T-Cell Maturation and Function .
FACS analysis was performed in 3-7-week-old mice to investigate whether tal-1 expression alters T- or B-cell development , as determined by the percentage of CD3¢* , CD4*/8* , CD4* , CD8 * , and CD45R * cells ( Table 1 ) .
In transgenic thymus , we observed a bor-derline , nonsignificant increase or decrease in the percentage of CD3 * or CD4*/CD8 * cells , respectively , as compared with control mice .
In the transgenic spleen : ( a ) the percentage of CD3 ¢ and CD4* cells was increased ( although nonsignificantly for the latter parameter in the 1849 line ) , as compared with control mice ; and ( b ) the number of CD8* or CD4SR* cells showed a borderline but not significant increase or decrease , respectively .
The morphological profile of the FACS scatter did not show gross abnormality when transgenic animals were compared with controls ( data not shown ) .
To assess whether TAL-1 interferes with the proliferation of T cells in thymus or spleen , primary cultures of these cells were incubated with appropriate amounts of IL-2 and ConA , and mitotic response was evaluated on the basis of the [ °H ] thymidine incorporation ( Table 2 ) .

Transgenic B cells stimulated by LPS showed a borderline nonsignificant decrease of incorporation values , when compared with controls ( Table 2 ) .
Survival of Lok-tal-1 Mice .
To determine the potential oncogenic effects of tal-1 expression in T cells , we grouped 30 animals for each strain ( 1849 and 1856 ) into two cohorts , which were followed for 70 weeks , together with a cohort of control , age-matched mice derived from control littermates ( Fig .
4 ) .
The differences in survival were striking ; most of the transgenic animals died by the end of the observation period , while control mice were alive .
Histopathological analysis was performed on moribund or dead mice ( Table 3 ; Fig .
5 ) .
The presence of lymphoid hyperplasia and/or frank lymphoma was evaluated .
In both lines , the number of lymphoid tumors was high and were combined with prevalent lymphoid hyper-plasia .
Most lymphoid tumors expressed the CD3 antigen , as evaluated by histochemical analysis ; the type of tumors varied from lym-phocytic lymphoma to lymphoblastic lymphoma .
Particularly , 80 % of tumors expressed a mixed T and B phenotype , as evaluated by the positivity for both CD3 and CD4SR ( CD4SR * cells ranged from < 5 to 50 % in some tumors ) .
Approximately 20 % of tumors were of T origin only .
Whether B-cell proliferation is determined by a lack of T-cell function or by tal-1 expression in B cells has not been established .
Our results show a potent effect of tal-1 on T-cell tumorigenesis in transgenic mice .
Interestingly , thymic cells from transgenic mice , cultured in low FCS concentration without exogenous growth factors or mitogens , showed a significantly enhanced survival , as compared with wild-type cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
Standard FACS analysis following propidium iodide staining showed that the number of apoptotic cells was consistently lower in transgenic than wild-type cell cultures ( data not shown ) .
Effects of p53 Heterozygosity on Survival of Lek-tal-1 Mice .
Many potential oncogenes fully express their proliferative potential only when the cell cycle checkpoints are altered ( 32 , 33 ) .
To definitively establish whether is an oncogene , it was necessary to show that TAL-I increases its oncogenic potential in these altered conditions , e.g. , in the presence of loss of a p53 allele .
Thus , p53~'~ male mice where cross-bred with tal-1*'* mice from strain 1849 .
A number of F , mice was obtained with the genotype tal-1*'~/p53 .
A cohort of 30 animals was established and compared with two other cohorts with the same number of animals bearing the genotype p53 ~ or tal-1*'~ , which had been obtained by crossing the homozygous tal-1 *'* or p53 ~~ mice with wild-type animals .
The mice were followed for approximately 70 weeks ; most of tal-1 *'~/p53 *'~ animals were dead by that age , thus in striking contrast with the other two cohorts of mice ( Fig .
7 ) .
Histopathological analysis , conducted on 22 tal-1 *'~/p53*'~ mice , showed lymphomas of T origin in all cases ( Table 4 ; Fig .
8 ) .
Discussion Data presented here show that TAL- ] is highly oncogenic when ectopically expressed in lymphoid cells of transgenic mice .
In fact , all animals died of lymphoid malignancies within 1 year .
Most of the tumors were of T lineage , presumably reflecting the selective expression of LCK in T cells ( 26 ) .
This contrasts with the finding that CD2-tal-1 mice were not affected by lymphoid malignancy ( 24 ) .
The discrepancy might lie in the different promoter used in our experiments , which may cause a different timing and/or level of tal-1 expression .
tal-1 protein associates in vivo and in vitro with another nuclear factor in addition to E2A protein , Lmo-2 ( 34 , 35 ) .
Similarly to TAL-I , the LMO-2 gene is rearranged and overexpressed in T lymphoid tumors with t ( 11 ; 14 ) ( p13 ; q11 ) ( 36-38 ) , whereas it is not expressed in normal T cells ( 37 ) .
In normal tissue development , Lmo-2 is expressed together with TAL-1 , especially in erythroid cells ( 39 ) .
Furthermore , selective expression of Lmo-2 in T cells driven by the CD2 Fig .

T LYMPHOMAS IN TRANSGENIC tal-1 MICE promoter cassette induces lymphomas ( 40 ) .
It has , therefore , been suggested that the physical interaction between tal-l1 and Lmo-2 , which may be functionally relevant in normal hematopoiesis ( 34 , 35 ) , also takes place in tumor cells and is causal in the genesis of tumors ; in fact , although transgenic CD2-tal-1 mice do not develop tumors , cross-breeding of these animals with CD2-Lmo-2 mice determine a shortening of survival due to a decrease of the tumor-free life interval ( 41 ) .
In this experimental setting , therefore , tal-1 serves as a tumor promoter , without having per se an oncogenic capacity .
Our data , in contrast , show that tal- 1 alone can generate T-cell tumors , without the inducing action of other oncogenes .
The oncogenic effect of TAL-1 is strikingly increased when its ectopic expression takes place in mice with a p53¢*'~ background .
In fact , in tal-1*'~/p53* '' ~ mice , the mortality rate was remarkably enhanced as compared with that of pS3*'~ mice .
Furthermore , all p53 *~ /tal-1 *~ mice died of disseminated T-cell lymphoma .
The effect of p53 absence on murine cancerogenesis is well established ( 42 ) .
Regarding p53 het-erozygosity , it has been shown that the survival rate in these animals , approximately 50 % after 80 weeks of age , is much higher than in control p53 *'* mice ( 43 ) .
In our experiments , all p53 heterozygous mice bearing a Lok-tal-1 transgene died by 40 weeks of age , thus shortening by more than one-half the survival , as compared with the homozygous parental strain of tal-1 mice .
Remarkably , a more extended survival was observed in the control p53~'* mice .
Therefore , tal-1 accelerates tumorigenicity in this condition .
A similar acceleration of tumorigenesis , although relatively reduced , has been reported when pS53~'~ mice were crossed with mice expressing the Wnr-/ oncogene selectively in the mammalian gland ( 44 ) .
Furthermore , it has been shown that c-myc and raf oncogenes are able to immortalize hematopoietic cells in the absence of p53 ( 32 ) .
Our group observed that TAL-/ gene transfer in the 32D murine hematopoietic progenitor cell line bearing a temperature-sensitive p53 gene causes apoptosis at permissive temperatures but favors cell proliferation upon p53 inactivation ( 25 ) .
Therefore , it is apparent that TAL-/ acts on im-mortalization similarly to c-myc or other oncogenes .
Furthermore , our results show that tal-1 expression in T-cell culture has an anti-apoptotic effect .
This finding is in line with other obser-vations , which unraveled the anti-apoptotic capacity of tal-1 in Jurkat ( 45 ) and 32D ( 25 ) cell lines and might also explain the absence of hematopoietic lineage differentiation in tal-1~ embryonic stem cells ( 17 ) .
Our results also suggest that E2A plays a role in T-cell homeostasis .
It has been shown by homologous recombination in mice that the £24 gene is not essential for T-cell development ; in fact , while B-cell development was blocked , no effect was detected in T cells ( 46 , 47 ) .
We show that in transgenic T cells , tal-1 is part of a DNA binding complex that contains a protein supershifted by anti-E2A antiserum , probably an E2A-related protein .
It may be hence speculated that a gene within the EZ2A family is expressed and exerts a regulatory role in the proliferation-differentiation of T cells .
In conclusion , our data indicate that TAL-/ is per se an oncogene , which has a role in human T cell leukemogenesis , rather than representing in T-ALL a gene with no proliferative potential ( 24 ) or a tumor promoter ( 41 ) .
