Bcl-3 Expression and Nuclear Translocation Are Induced by Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor and Erythropoietin in Proliferating Human Erythroid Precursors By Min-Ying Zhang , Edward W. Harhaj , Laurie Bell , Shao-Cong Sun , and Barbara A. Miller Bel-3 is a proto-oncogene involved in the chromosomal translocation t ( 14 ; 19 ) found in some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia .
It shares structural similarities with and is a member of the IB family of proteins .
In this report , involvement of Be/-3 in hematopoietic growth factor-stimulated erythroid proliferation and differentiation was examined .
In TF-1 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and erythropoietin ( Epo ) greatly enhanced Be/-3 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in association with stimulation of proliferation .
Bcl-3 protein was also highly expressed in early burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) -derived erythroid precursors ( day 7 ) and decreased during maturation ( days 10 and 14 ) , suggesting that Bcl-3 is involved in normal erythroid proliferation .
In these hematopoietic cells , Bel-3 was hyperphosphorylated .
GM-CSF and Epo modulated the subcellular localization of Bcel-3 .
Upon stimulation of TF-1 cells with GM-CSF or Epo , the nuclear translo- Bel-3 WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED from a chronic lympho- cytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient with the chromosomal translocation t ( 14 ; 19 ) ( q32 ; q13.1 ) . '
This breakpoint junction does not affect the structural integrity of Bei-3 , but results in the overexpression of Bcl-3 mRNA in leukemic cells !
Bcl-3 overexpression is proposed to contribute to the development of CLL through dysregulation of a gene ( s ) normally regulated by NE- « B transcription factors and important in cell proliferation and differentiation . ''
The Bel-3 protein has a distinct pattern of ankyrin-related repeats and is structurally similar to other members of the IB family of proteins , including IxBa , IBB , and IxBy.3 > NF- « B/Re !
designates a widely distributed family of transcription factors that modulate the expression of genes involved in immune and acute-phase responses as well as the response to signals for rapid gene expression . ''
The DNA-binding forms of NE- « B transcription factors are heterodimers or homodimers composed of different combinations of 5 structurally related DNA-binding proteins , p50 , p52 , RelA ( p65 ) , RelB , and c-Rel .
These proteins share a highly conserved amino-terminal sequence called the Rel homology region ( RHR ) . ''
Specific heterodimers or homodimers of these proteins bind to target enhancer elements ( « B ) present in the promoters of regulated genes .
The activity of these proteins is regulated through cytoplasmic retention by physical interaction with cytoplasmic inhibitors termed IxB . '' ''
IxB proteins interact with the RHR of NF- « B proteins through their ankyrin repeats.8 Stimulation of cells with NF-KB inducers leads to rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IKxBs , allowing NF-KB to translocate to the nucleus to activate targets . ''
Based on protein structural similarities and interaction with proteins , Bel-3 is considered to be a member of the IxB family .
However , despite structural homology , Bel-3 and IxBs appear to have different roles in the regulation of NF- « B/Re ! l proteins .
Whereas IxBa is primarily cytoplasmic , transiently transfected Bel-3 protein is predominantly located in the nucleus. > > '' IxBa inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-kB/ Blood , Vol 92 , No 4 ( August 15 ) , 1998 : pp 1225-1234 cation of Bel-3 was dramatically enhanced .
Overexpression of Bcel-3 in TF-1 cells by transient transfection along with the NF- « B factors p50 or p52 resulted in significant induction of an human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( HIV-1 ) « B-TATA-luceriferase reporter plasmid , demonstrating that Bcl-3 has a positive role in transactivation of « B-containing genes in erythroid cells .
Stimulation with GM-CSF enhanced emyb mRNA expression in these cells .
Bcel-3 in nuclear extracts of TF-1 cells bound to a xB enhancer in the c-myb promoter together with NF- « B2/p52 and this binding activity was enhanced by GM-CSF stimulation .
Furthermore , cotransfection of Bel-3 with p52 or p50 in TF-1 cells resulted in significant activation of a e-myb « B-TATA-luceriferase reporter plasmid .
These findings suggest that Bcl-3 may participate in the transcriptional regulation of certain « B-containing genes involved in hematopoiesis , including e-myb .

Under certain conditions , Bel-3 may also function to antagonize the DNA binding of nuclear p50 homodimers , which can be xB-specific repressors of active forms of NF- « kB/Rel1. > > '' Thus , these transient transfection studies suggest that Bel-3 plays a positive regulatory role in xB-specific gene transcription .
The in vivo role of Bcl-3 in different cell types is less clear .

1226 E ) -derived erythroid precursors and decreased with maturation , suggesting that Bcl-3 is involved in normal erythroid proliferation .
In contrast to previous transfection studies , '' '' endogenous Bel-3 in TE-1 cells and normal erythroblasts was located in both nucleus and cytoplasm .
After growth factor stimulation of TP-1 cells , a gradual but dramatic translocation of Bcel-3 to the nucleus was observed .
Transient transfection studies with TP-1 cells showed that overexpression of Bel-3 along with p50 or p52 resulted in significant transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( HIV-1 ) xB enhancer , suggesting that Bcl-3 can modulate expression of regulated genes in vivo in TF-1 cells .
Induction of c-myb mRNA was observed in GM-CSE-stimulated TF-1 cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) using the NFP- « B binding site of the c-myb promoter suggested that a nuclear complex of Bel-3 and p52 bound to the c-myb promoter and this complex was induced by GM-CSF stimulation of TF-1 cells .
Overexpression of Bel-3 along with p52 or p50 was also able to significantly induce expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a xB site present in the c-myb promoter .
These data indicate that Bcel-3 may participate in the regulation of kB-containing genes involved in hematopoiesis including c-myb .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Culture of BFU-E-derived erythroblasts and TF-1 cells .
- Peripheral blood was obtained from normal volunteer donors at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center ( Hershey , PA ) under protocols approved by the Institution 's Clinical Investigation Committee .
BFU-E-derived erythroblasts were cultured as described previously .
'* Briefly , peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated on Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia , Piscat-away , NJ ) and cultured in 0.9 % methylcellulose media containing 30 % fetal calf serum , 9.0 mg/mL deionized bovine serum albumin ( Cohn fraction V ; Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis , MO ) , 1.4 X 10~* mol/L B-mercaptoethanol , and 2 U/mL Epo ( recombinant Epo > 100,000 U/mg ; Amgen , Thousand Oaks , CA ) .
Single BFU-E , when cultured in methylcellulose , proliferate and differentiate over 14 days to form large colonies containing 1 to 5 X 10* mature erythroblasts .
These cells can be removed from culture at different days to study a well-defined population of normal human cells at distinct stages of maturation . ''
Day-7 cells are poorly hemoglobinized blasts with a large proliferative capacity , day-10 cells are partially hemoglobinized proerythroblasts with decreased proliferative capacity , and day-14 cells are terminally differentiating polychromatophilic and orthochromatic normoblasts .
Cells from maturing BFU-E-derived colonies were plucked from culture on days 7 , 10 , and 14 .
Cytocentrifuge preparations of aliquots of BFU-E-derived cells routinely identified greater than 99 % as erythroid precursors .
TE-1 cells , a human erythroleukemia cell line , '' '' were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 1 to 2 ng/mL human recombinant GM-CSF ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) or 5 U/mL Epo .
To examine Bei-3 induction , TF-1 cells were removed from growth factor for 24 hours and then stimulated with 2 ng/mL GM-CSF or with 5 U/mL recombinant Epo .
Samples were collected at intervals over 0 to 24 hours .

RESULTS GM-CSF and Epo induce Bcl-3 expression in TF-1 cells .
To explore the potential role of the proto-oncogene Be/-3 in hematopoietic growth factor-stimulated proliferation , the expression of Bel-3 was investigated by Western blotting analysis in GM-CSF-stimulated and Epo-stimulated TF-1 cells .
The proliferation of TF-1 cells is dependent on growth factors , including GM-CSF , Epo , and IL-3 , but the molecular mechanisms by which these hematopoietic growth factors induce the growth of Fig 1 .
Bcl-3 expression in GM-CSF-stimulated and Epo-stimulated TF-1 cells .
Whole cell lysates were prepared from growth factor-induced TF-1 cells at the time points indicated .
Thirty micrograms of protein was loaded on each lane of a 12 % polyacrylamide gel ( Bel-3 ) or 15 ug of protein was loaded on each lane of a 10 % polyacrylamide gel ( IxBa ) .
The membranes were blotted with anti-Bcl-3 ( 1:200 ) or anti-l « Ba ( 1:2,000 ) antibody as a control and then detected with ECL .
N.D. indicates time points that were not done .
Three independent experiments showed induction of Bel-3 expression .
GM-CSF EPO 1227 TF-1 cells have only been partially identified .
TF-1 cells were growth factor deprived for 24 hours .
The viability of TF-1 cells 24 hours after growth factor deprivation was greater than 97 % , and less than 5 % of apoptotic cells were detected .
After growth factor deprivation , 2 ng/mL of GM-CSF or 5 U/mL of Epo was added to the medium to induce cells to proliferate and the cells were subsequently continuously stimulated by growth factor .
At different time points , stimulated TF-1 cells were collected for analysis of Bel-3 expression .
Bel-3 protein was markedly induced after GM-CSF or Epo stimulation ( Fig 1 ) .
At 2 hours ( GM-CSF ) or 4 hours ( Epo ) of stimulation , the level of Bel-3 protein was approximately 3 times more than that in nonstimulated cells .
The level of Bcl-3 protein remained elevated for at least 24 hours after stimulation .
Both higher and lower molecular weight isoforms of Bcl-3 were induced .
Because Bel-3 has been proposed to be an IxB-like protein , the expression pattern of IxBa was also analyzed in these stimulated TF-1 cells .
However , in contrast to Bel-3 , IxBa did not show increased expression in response to GM-CSF or Epo stimulation ( Fig 1 ) .
These data suggest that hematopoietic growth factors participate in regulation of Bel-3 expression in TF-1 cells .
To examine the mechanism underlying the induction of Bei-3 by hematopoietic growth factors , total RNA was extracted from TF-1 cells after stimulation by GM-CSF or Epo .
Northern blotting showed that Be/-3 transcripts increased significantly after 30 minutes of TF-1 stimulation by GM-CSF and continued to be elevated for 24 hours ( Fig 2 ) .
This expression pattern is consistent with results of Western blotting .
With Epo , a similar increase in Bei-3 mRNA was observed .
As a control , 18S rRNA showed no significant change ( Fig 2 ) .
Taken together , these data suggest that growth factor stimulation of TE-1 proliferation results in enhanced expression and that induced Bc/-3 expression is mediated at the level of transcription .
After growth factor deprivation of TF-1 cells for 24 hours , in 3 experiments , 55 % to 60 % of cells were determined to be in GO/G1 of the cell cycle , and the rest of the cells were in S or G2/M phase .
The percentage of cells in S phase increased significantly to a mean peak of 52 % + 2 % at 4 to 10 hours after growth factor stimulation ( P = .02 ) .
The percentage of cells in G2 and M phase also increased significantly , and the increase peaked at 16 to 20 hours after growth factor stimulation ( P < 002 ) .
The doubling time of TF-1 cells was 24 hours .
No significant differences were noted in the cell cycle status of cells after GM-CSF compared with Epo stimulation .
It is noteworthy that the increase in Bel-3 protein and mRNA preceded the entrance of the majority of cells into S phase , but in TF-1 cells , Hr .

Nuclear expression of Bcl-3 is enhanced by hematopoietic growth factors .
- Previously , transiently transfected Bel-3 protein has been predominantly localized in the nucleus . ''
The N-terminal part of Bcl-3 resembles a nuclear localization signal .
Although this sequence is not perfectly conserved compared with other nuclear localization signals , deletion of this sequence abolished the nuclear localization of Bel-3.2 The subcellular localization of endogenous Bel-3 in a physiological setting , such as in hematopoietic growth factor-stimulated proliferation , remains unclear .
To determine the subcellular localization of Bcel-3 in TF-1 cells , nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated from GM-CSF-induced or Epo-induced cells and Western blotting analysis was performed .
Bel-3 protein was weakly detectable in both cytoplasm and nucleus before growth factor stimulation ( Fig 3 ) .
The effect of growth factor stimulation on the subcellular localization of Bel-3 was determined .
Growth factor stimulation greatly enhanced the level of cytoplasmic Bel-3 ( Fig 3 ) .
However , in addition , the nuclear level of Bel-3 also was greatly increased , suggesting that growth factors enhance Bel-3 nuclear translocation .
To -- Northern blotting analysis was performed using 40 ug RNA from each sample .
°P-dCTP-labeled Bc/-3 cDNA was used as a probe .
18s rRNA is shown as a control for equivalent loading .
control for the quality of subcellular fractionation , nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were examined for IxBa and E47 localization .
IkBa , a cytoplasmic protein , was not detected in the nuclear fraction ( Fig 3 ) .
E47 , a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor , '' '' was primarily detected in the nucleus ( Fig 3 ) .
Bcl-3 expression in normal human erythroblasts is correlated with proliferation .
- The expression of Bel-3 protein was determined in normal erythroid proliferation and differentiation .
Human BFU-E-derived erythroid precursors were removed from culture on days 7 , 10 , and 14 of maturation . ''
Day-7 cells have a large proliferative capacity , day-10 cells are only partially hemoglobinized with decreased proliferative capacity , and day-14 cells are largely terminally differentiating normoblasts .
Western blotting assay was performed using whole cell lysates from day-7 , -10 , and -14 cells ( Fig 4A ) .
In day-7 cells , which are rapidly proliferating , Bel-3 had the highest expression level and decreased as erythroid precursors terminally differentiated .
This dynamic pattern suggests that Bcl-3 expression is associated with normal erythroid proliferation rather than differentiation .
Although Bcel-3 was minimally detectable in day-14 cells , IxBa showed little decline during differentiation and substantial quantities were still present at day 14 .

Bcl-3 expression in day-7 , -10 , and -14 BFU-E-derived erythroblasts .
( A ) Normal human BFU-E-derived erythroblasts were harvested and the whole cell lysates from 4 x 10° ( Bel-3 ) or 2 x 10° ( IxBa ) cells were separated on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel .
Western analysis was performed with anti-Bcl-3 or anti-l « Ba antibodies and ECL .
( B ) Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were separated from day-10 cells .
Fifty micrograms of nuclear ( N ) or cytoplasmic ( C ) extract was loaded onto each lane of a 10 % gel and subjected to Western blotting .
Tw o experiments were performed with anti-Bcl-3 or anti-l « Ba antibodies with identical results .
Day Bcel-3 IKBo day-10 BFU-E-derived cells , subcellular localization studies with nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts also showed that Bel-3 was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm , whereas IxBa was primarily cytoplasmic ( Fig 4B ) .
Bcl-3 is hyperphosphorylated in TF-1 and BFU-E-derived erythroblasts .
- Bel-3 mRNA has previously been shown to be expressed in several mammalian tissues . ''
Expression of Bel-3 protein was examined here in 7 human tissues .
Bel-3 was highly expressed in heart , skeletal muscle , and erythroid precursors ; weakly detectable in liver , kidney , and spleen ; and barely detectable in the brain ( Fig 5 ) .
Parallel Northern blotting ( Clontech ) showed that the pattern of Bel-3 protein correlated with mRNA expression ( data not shown ) and a single mRNA band was observed .
The molecular weight of Bcel-3 deduced from the protein sequence is 47 kD . '
Bel-3 protein detected from normal human tissues such as heart , skeletal muscle , spleen , and liver showed a slightly higher molecular weight ( Fig 5 ) .
Western blotting analysis showed multiple isoforms of Bel-3 in GM-CSF- or Epo-stimulated TF-1 cells , and the same result was obtained with BFU-E-derived erythroblasts ( Figs 1 , 3 , and 4 ) .
In BFU-E-derived erythroblasts ( Fig 5 ) or TF-1 cells ( Fig 6 ) , Bel-3 was larger than that in other human tissues .
It is known that Bel-3 is a proline- and serine-rich protein with high phosphorylation potential . '' ''
To test if the observed heterogeneity in size was due to protein phosphorylation , TF-1 and BFU-E-derived erythroblast cells and normal heart were treated with CIP .
CIP treatment resulted in molecular weight reduction of Bel-3 in both TF-1 ( Fig 6 , top ) and BFU-E-derived ( Fig 6 , bottom ) cells .
However , CIP had no effect on the molecular weight of Bel-3 from human heart tissue .
In Fig 6 , the highest & 20 og - og ; go go $ o < - $ kDa U : [ aa ] - ] V $ 2 66 gam l 46 7 ( lims Spleen 1229 10 14 molecular weight band was thought to represent a nonspecific protein , because it was inconsistently observed .
These data demonstrate that the different size of Bcl-3 protein in tissue compared with TE-1 or BFU-E-derived cells is at least partially due to differential Bel-3 phosphorylation .
GM-CSF and Epo stimulated the appearance of higher and lower molecular weight Bel-3 isoforms ( Fig 1 ) and both are found in TF-1 and BFU-E nucleus and cytoplasm ( Figs 4 and 6 ) .
The functional significance of Bcl-3 hyperphosphorylation in these hematopoietic-derived cells remains to be determined , but in other systems Bel-3 dephosphorylation resulted in decreased activity .
`` ~ Overexpression of Bcl-3 in TF-1 cells activates an HIV-1 kB To determine whether Bcl-3 has a role in gene activation in TF-1 cells , functional reporter gene assays were performed with an HIV-1 kB-TATA-luciferase reporter plas-mid . ''
This plasmid was cotransfected into proliferating TF-1 cells ( cultured in the presence of GM-CSF ) along with cDNA for Bcl-3 , p50 , or p52 .
In these experiments , indicated amounts of plasmids expressing p50 , 52 , or Bcl-3 were transfected either separately or in combination along with 0.5 ug of HIV-1 xB-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid into TF-1 cells .
The total amount of transfected DNA ( 2.0 ug ) was kept constant by adding appropriate amounts of expression vector without insert .
The pGL2 vector was transfected as the negative control .
As shown in Fig 7 , a high level of was expressed when this reporter plasmid was transfected alone .
This result is consistent with our finding that endogenous Bel-3 and other NE- « B factors are induced in TFE-1 cells by the growth factor GM-CSF '' Significant further induction of luciferase was observed in TF-1 cells cotransfected with the xB-TATA reporter enhancer .

plasmid and Bel-3 together with p50 or p52 ( P < .05 ) .
These results demonstrate that both endogenously expressed and transfected Bel-3 and NF-KB factors p50 or p52 are capable of positively stimulating gene expression from the HIV-1 kB enhancer in TF-1 cells .
In control experiments ( not shown ) , 1.5 ug of plasmid expressing NP- « B factors p50 or p52 was cotransfected with 0.5 ug of HIV-1 « kB-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid in TP-1 cells .
Luciferase activity was not significantly different from cotransfection with the reporter plasmid alone .
Bcl-3 binds to and transactivates a kB site in the c-myb promoter .
- Previous studies have shown that transiently transfected Bcl-3 or purified Bel-3 proteins interact with both p50 and p52 subunits of NF- « B/Rel proteins. > '' ** '' '' Depending on experimental conditions , different functional results have been reported .
Bel-3 protein has been observed to either inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF-kB p50 and p52 in vitro '' or facilitate p52 or p50 activity by forming a complex with these NF- « B proteins on DNA .
** '' ° To examine the role of Bcl-3 in xB binding under physiological conditions , the interaction of endogeneous Bel-3 with NF- « B transcription factors in growth factor-stimulated TF-1 cells was examined .
EMSA was performed using an NF- « B binding site that recently was identified from the promoter region of the human c-myb gene and nuclear extracts from TF-1 cells stimulated with GM-CSF for 24 hours .
This site was chosen because induction of c-myb mRNA in response to GM-CSF stimulation was observed in these TF-1 ( data not shown ) and c-myb has previously been shown to have an important role in erythropoiesis . '' '' '' ''
Three major protein/ DNA complexes were detected ( Fig 8 , C1 , C2 , and C3 ) .
Antibody supershift assays showed that all 3 complexes , C1 , C2 , and C3 , immunoreacted with the anti-p52 antibody .
The anti-p50 antibody supershifted both C2 and C3 complexes , whereas anti-p65 ( RelA ) supershifted the C2 complex .
None of these complexes was immunoreactive with antibodies for RelB or c-Rel .
These results suggest that p50 and p52 bind to the NE- « B site as either homodimers or heterodimers with each other or with p65 .
Formation of the C1 complex was reproducibly inhibited by anti-Bcl-3 antibody , suggesting that Bel-3 is a part of this complex , which is also composed of p52 .
In nonstimulated TF-1 cells , the C1 complex containing Bel-3 and p52 was much weaker than that detected in induced cells ( Fig 8B ) .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that induction of Bcl-3 expression by GM-CSF contributes to enhancement of Bcl-3 DNA binding and increased formation of C1 .
To further examine whether Bel-3 has a role in regulating c-myb expression , the c-myb xB-TATA-luciferase plasmid was cotransfected into proliferating TF-1 cells ( cultured with GM-CSF ) along with cDNA for Bel-3 , p50 , or p52 .

Activation of an HIV-1 « B-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid after overexpression of Bcl-3 in TF-1 cells .
A total of 0.5 pg of plasmids expressing Bcl-3 , p50 , or p52 was cotransfected with 0.5 ug of the HIV-1 « B-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid into TF-1 cells separately or in combination .
The pGL2 basic vector ( 0.5 ug ) was used as negative control .
Where noted , 1.0 mg of Bcl-3 was cotransfected .
The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding appropriate amounts of expression vector without insert .
At 48 hours after transfection , cells were collected for luciferase assay .
Results are expressed as the mean + SEM ( x10° com ) .
Five experiments were performed .
* A significant increase above the « B-TATA reporter plasmid ( P= .05 ) .
As shown in Fig 9 , significant levels of c-myb kB-TATA-luciferase were expressed when this reporter plasmid was transfected alone .
This is consistent with our finding that Bel-3 and other NF-kB factors are induced by GM-CSF® and that significant amounts of c-myb mRNA are present in these cells ( data not shown ) .
A significant induction of luciferase was observed when the TF-1 cells were transfected with the c-myb reporter plasmid along with Bel-3 together with p52 or 50 ( P = 05 ) .
These results demonstrate that endogenously induced and transfected Bel-3/NF- « B factors are capable of inducing gene expression from the c-myb NF-B site in vivo in TF-1 cells .
DISCUSSION GM-CSF and Epo induce erythroid proliferation by triggering a cascade of signal transduction events .
Upon binding to their specific receptors , these growth factors induce activation of second messengers , including the protein tyrosine kinase 1231 JAK2 , Stat5 , ras , Raf-1 , and MAP kinase . '' '' ''
Induction of these signaling proteins results in activation of specific transcription factors , including GATA-1 , SCL and other basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors , NF-E2 , and RBTN2 , which in turn control erythroid proliferation and differentiation .
`` `` '' '' 2 In this study , involvement of the proto-oncogene Be/-3 in the signaling mechanisms of GM-CSF and Epo is demonstrated .
The expression of Bei-3 is greatly enhanced by hematopoietic growth factor stimulation at the level of both transcription and translation .
A dynamic expression pattern of Be/-3 in normal erythroid cells is demonstrated , suggesting that Be/-3 is also involved in normal erythropoiesis .
The induction of Bei-3 by both GM-CSF and Epo involves enhanced expression of Bel-3 mRNA , suggesting that these growth factors induce transcription of the Bei-3 gene .
A number of potential regulatory sequences have been found in the 5 ' -flanking region of the Bel-3 gene . ''
These sequences include binding sites for Spl , AP-1 , AP-2 , and NF- « B , indicating possible involvement of these transcriptional factors in regulation of Bei-3 gene expression . '' ''
In addition to these elements , we observed two other potential regulatory sequences , CAGCTG and CAACTG . '
These two DNA sequences are highly similar to the E-protein binding site CANNTG , termed E-box . '' ''
E-proteins belonging to the bHLH family of transcription factors form heterodimers with tissue-specific transcription factors such as SCL , which then bind to E-box motifs to participate in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell growth.39444 We and others have previously shown that SCL , E47 , and HEB are involved in BFU-E-derived human erythroid proliferation and GM-CSF stimulation of TF-1 cells induces E47 expresssion ( Fig 3 ) , and this was also observed for HEB and E2-2 ( data not shown ) .
Bel-3 transcription is likely controlled through recognition of binding sites in the promoter region of Bel-3 by growth factor-regulated transcription factors involved in erythroid proliferation and differentiation , which may include SCL heterodimers .
The studies reported here demonstrate that endogenous Bel-3 is located in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments .
Similar results have been obtained by immunofluorescent staining of TF-1 cells ( not shown ) .
These results are not in full agreement with previous reports in which the transiently transfected Bcl-3 is primarily expressed in the nucleus. > > '' Such discrepancy suggests that the nuclear expression of Bcl-3 may be regulated under physiological conditions .
The cytoplasmic retention of endogenous Bcl-3 in TF-1 and BFU-E-derived cells may be due to physical association with other proteins or to posttranslational modifications .
Bcl-3 has been shown to form nuclear complexes with NF-KB p50 and but it is not known what factors form cytoplasmic complexes with Bel-3 .
Our studies also demonstrate that Bel-3 is hyperphosphorylated in both TF-1 cells and normal erythroblasts .
High and low molecular weight isoforms are present in nucleus and cytoplasm ; therefore , the phosphorylation state does not appear to determine subcellular localization .
Higher and lower molecular weight isoforms are also induced by growth factor stimulation .
The function of different phosphorylation states of Bcl-3 is not clear at this time .
Phosphorylation of Bel-3 has previously been shown to be important for full activity in other cell types. > * For example , dephosphorylation of Bel-3 in thymocytes greatly From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

- Bcl-3 is associated with NF- « B p52 in TF-1 cells ( EMSA ) .
( A ) Six micrograms of nuclear extracts prepared from TF-1 cells stimulated with GM-CSF for 24 hours was incubated with different NF-B antibodies for 10 minutes before adding a P-labeled c-myb « B binding oligonuciear probe .
Three DNA-protein complexes were generated .
Complexes 2 and 3 ( C2 and C3 ) were supershifted by anti-p50 ; C1 , C2 , and C3 were shifted by anti-p52 .
C1 was reproducibly inhibited by anti-Bcl-3 antibody ( with a long exposure , a supershifted band was also visible ) .
However , anti-RelB and anti-c-Rel had no effect on any of these complexes .
Similar results were observed in 3 experiments .
( B ) EMSA was performed with grow th factor-deprived TF-1 cells or TF-1 cells induced w ith GM-CSF for 24 hours .
The C1 complex was greatly increased by GM-CSF stimulation , whereas other complexes had no significant change .

decreased the ability of Bel-3 to augment the DNA binding activity of endogenous p50 homodimers .
* GM-CSF and Epo not only induce the expression of Bei-3 but also enhance nuclear translocation upon stimulation of TF-1 cells with these hematopoietic growth factors .
Interaction of Bel-3 with NF- « B/Re !
transcription factors has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies , although the functional consequences of these interactions remains controversial . ''
Although some studies demonstrated that Bcl-3 inhibits the DNA binding activity of NF-kB proteins , other studies showed that Bel-3 binds to a xB enhancer together with p52 or p50 and serves as a transcriptional activator .
Consistent with the latter finding , we demonstrated here that overexpression of Bcl-3 along with p50 or p52 in TF-1 cells results in induction of both HIV-1 and ec-myb reporter genes and that Bel-3 has a function in gene activation in vivo in TE-1 cells .
These results provide evidence that Bel-3 may play a positive role in transactivation of genes in erythroid cells .
In TF-1 cells , GM-CSF stimulates increased e-myb mRNA expression .
We also present data that suggest that Bel-3 forms a complex with NP- « B p52 on a kB element present in the promoter of the c-myb gene and that formation of this complex is enhanced by stimulation with GM-CSF .
Bel-3 interaction with nuclear NF- « B proteins , including p52 , may contribute to induction of expression of specific genes involved in erythroid proliferation , including e-myb .
The importance of c-myb in erythropoiesis has previously been demonstrated . '' '' '' ''
The reported increase in Bel-3 in response to mitogenic signaling , associated with induction of immediate genes c-fos and c-myc , is consistent with our observations . !
