Fauci , December 29 , 1992 ( received for review December 11 , 1992 ) ABSTRACT The NF-B transcription factor complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein IxB-a ( MAD-3 ) .
Various cellular stimuli relieve this inhibition by mechanisms largely unknown , leading to NF-xB nuclear localization and transactivation of its target genes .
It is demonstrated here with human T lymphocytes and monocytes that different stimuli , including tumor necrosis factor a and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , cause rapid degradation of IxB-a , with concomitant activation of NF- B , followed by a dramatic increase in IxB-a mRNA and protein synthesis .
Transfection studies reveal that the IxB-a mRNA and the encoded protein are potently induced by NF-xB and by homodimers of p65 and of c-Rel .
We propose a model in which NF-xB and IxB-a mutually regulate each other in a cycle : saturating amounts of the inhibitory IxB-a protein are destroyed upon stimulation , allowing rapid activation of NF-B .
Subsequently , IxB-a mRNA and protein levels are quickly induced by the activated NF-xB .
This resurgence of IxB-a protein acts to restore an equilibrium in which is again inhibited .
NF- « B is a dimeric transcription factor that binds and regulates gene expression through decameric cis-acting « B DNA motifs ( reviewed in refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Although a p50/p65 heterodimer has traditionally been referred to as NF- « B and remains the prototypical and most abundant form , it has been recognized recently that several distinct but closely related homo- and heterodimeric factors are responsible for « B site-dependent DNA binding activity and regulation .
The various dimeric factors are composed of members of the family of Rel-related polypeptides .
One subclass of this family , distinguished by its proteolytic processing from precursor forms and lack of recognized activation domains , includes p50 ( NFKB1 ) ( 3-6 ) and p50B ( NFKB2 , p52 ) ( 7-10 ) , whereas the second subclass contains recognized activation domains and includes p65 ( RelA ) ( 11-13 ) , RelB ( 14 , 15 ) , c-Rel ( 16 ) , v-Rel ( 17 , 18 ) , and the Drosophila protein Dorsal ( 19 ) .
All Rel-related members share a 300-amino acid region of homology , responsible for DNA binding and dimerization , called the Rel homology domain .
Activation of the NF- « B transcription factor and various related forms can be initiated by a variety of agents , including tumor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( 1 , 2 ) .
Activation proceeds through a post-translational event in which preformed cytoplasmic NF- « B is released from a cytoplasmic inhibitory protein , IxB-a ( MAD-3 ) ( 20-23 ) .
IxB-a inhibits transactivation of the p50/p65 heterodimer , by binding to the p65 component , blocking the dimer 's translocation to the nucleus ( 20 , 21 , 23 ) .
IxB-a also inhibits complexes containing c-Rel or RelB ( 24 , 25 ) .
IxB-a blocks binding in vitro of various NF-KB dimers to xB binding sites in DNA ( 11 , 12 , 15 , 22 , 26 , 27 ) .

This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
2532 latter effect requires nuclear IxB-a , its relevance , in vivo , is unknown .
Although IxB-a is generally a cytoplasmic protein ( 21 , 23 ) , it and its chicken homolog ( pp40 ) have also been detected in the nucleus ( refs .
28-30 and K.B. , G.F. , and U.S. , unpublished results ) .
In addition to the well-characterized and cloned IxB-a and its chicken and rat homologs ( 24 , 31 ) , another biochemically defined form , IkB-B , has been reported , but this remains to be fully characterized ( 26 , 31 , 32 ) .
Phosphorylation of IxB-a in vitro by protein kinases A and C and heme-activated kinase abolished IxB-a 's inhibition of DNA binding by NF- « B ( 24 , 32 , 33 ) .
Although activation of NF- « B has been conjectured to proceed through phosphorylation , no modification of IxB-a has yet been reported in vivo .
It is also unknown how the inhibited state is maintained in unstimulated cells-that is , how the ratio of IxB-a protein to target complexes is regulated .
We show here that a mutual cycle of regulation of IxB-a and NF- « B exists .
Stimulation results in a rapid loss of IxB-a from cells ( probably following its modification ) and the rapid nuclear translocation of NF- « B .
Transactivation by NF- « B , in turn , induces high levels of IkB-a synthesis , which can then restore the unstimulated inhibited state .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Extract Preparations and Transfections .
Cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation after freeze-thawing .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al .
( 34 ) .
Transfections were performed in NTera-2 cells using the PMT2T vector plasmid as described ( 9 ) .
The PMT2T-I « B- « plasmid was constructed by insertion of an EcoRI fragment of 1550 nucleotide pairs containing full-length IxB- « /MAD-3 cDNA ( 22 ) into the EcoRI site of PMT2T .
PMT2T-p65 and p50 plasmids were described ( 9 ) .
PMT2T c-Rel plasmid was constructed by cloning the EcoRI fragment of full-length human c-Rel cDNA ( 16 ) into the EcoRI site of PMT2T .
Western Blotting .
Cell extracts were subjected to SDS/ PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose ( Schleicher & Schuell BA8S ) , and IxB-a was detected with polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against either N- or C-terminal domains ( amino acids 1-129 and 230-315 , respectively ) or both , followed by a second incubation with '*I-labeled protein A ( New England Nuclear ) .
Both antibodies detected the same protein in Western blots .
[ In addition , a peptide antibody directed against an N-terminal peptide reacted with the same protein and this could be blocked by competition with added peptide ( K.B .
and U.S. , unpublished results ) . ]
Northern Blotting .
Total RNA was prepared ( 35 ) , fraction-ated on an agarose formaldehyde gel , blotted , and hybridized Abbreviations : TNF-a , tumor necrosis factor a ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; PHA , phytohemagglutinin ; EMSA , electro- phoretic mobility shift assay ; PD , palindromic .

RESULTS Stimulation by PMA or TNF-a Causes Rapid , Transient Loss of IxB-a « .
Stimulation of U937 monocytic cells or Jurkat T cells led to rapid disappearance of IxB-a as judged by Western blots of cell extracts ( Figs .
14 and 24 ) .
Fig .
14 shows the time course of IxB-a degradation in U937 cells following activation by PMA plus the calcium ionophore ionomycin or by TNF-a .
Disappearance of IxB-a was rapid but transient .
Undetectable 10 min after stimulation , IkB-a reappeared between 20 and 40 min , reaching levels equal to or greater than in unstimulated cells .
The reappearance of IxB-a was inhibited by cycloheximide , demonstrating a requirement for protein synthesis ( Fig .
14 , right ) .
Stimulation with PMA alone gave similar results ( not shown ) .
Jurkat cells stimulated by PMA plus phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) or by 'TNF-a ( Fig .
24 ) and human peripheral blood T cells treated with PHA plus PMA ( not shown ) showed modulation of I « B-a levels similar to that seen for U937 cells .
The same results were obtained with different IxB-a antibodies , indicating that the disappearance of IxB-a upon stimulation was not due to shielding of a particular epitope caused by modification of the IxB-a protein .
A new , transient , activation-dependent species of IxB-a « was detected in U937 cells soon after stimulation with TNF-a when cell extracts were prepared in the presence of phos-phatase inhibitors ( Fig .
3 ) .
This new species migrated slightly slower than the IxB- « of unstimulated cells and rapidly disappeared with further stimulation .
It is presumably a phosphorylated form of IxB-a ; however , this remains to be demonstrated directly .
The modified form was also seen in PMA-stimulated U937 cells ( not shown ) .
Degradation of IxB-a Is Correlated with NF-xB Activation .
The disappearance of IxB-a from the cell following stimulation correlated closely with the activation of NF- « B .

The experimental procedure was as in Fig .

cells NF- « B binding to « B sites ( i.e. , p50/p65 ) was easily detected 2.5-5 min after stimulation with TNF-a ( Fig .
1B ) .
The induced binding activity was composed largely of p50/ p65 heterodimers as determined by supershifting with specific antibodies .
These experiments also confirmed that the faster migrating species present in unstimulated and stimulated cells was composed of p50 homodimers [ not shown ; the band assignments concur with earlier reports ( 22 , 37-39 ) ] .
NF- « B binding activity continued to increase in concert with the loss of IxB-a for up to 10 min of stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin or with TNF-a .
Similar results were obtained with stimulated Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
Analysis of nuclear and cytosolic extracts of resting and stimulated Jurkat and U937 cells revealed that the loss of I « xB-a correlated with translocation of NF- « B from the cytoplasm into the nucleus ( Fig .
2C shows nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells ; U937 data not shown ) .
Provided that the external stimulus was maintained , nuclear pS0/p65 levels remained high despite the appearance of newly synthesized I « B-a ( a 2-h stimulation is shown in Fig .
2C ) .
The mechanism by which NF- « B persists in the nucleus with continued stimulation is unclear .
When TNF-a was removed after 15 min by washing and addition of TNF-a antibodies , nuclear p50/p65 binding activity declined rapidly , in accord with a prior report ( 40 ) ( a 105-min time point following removal of TNF-a is shown in Fig .
2C ) .
Thus , brief stimulation by TNF-a produced a transient loss of IxB-a and only a transient increase of nuclear NF-KB ( p50/p65 ) .
Kinetics of IxB-a mRNA Induction Following Stimulation .
Stimulation of U937 by PMA or TNF-a for short periods , up to 10 min , had little effect on the level of IxB-a mRNA ( Fig .
4 ) .

No change in the level of GAPDH mRNA with stimulation was seen ( not shown ) .

USA 90 ( 1993 ) was activated .
IxB-a mRNA levels surged , however , by 20 min .
Again , Jurkat cells behaved similarly ( not shown ) .
Thus , although the loss of IkB-a that follows quickly after stimulation was not associated with a loss of mRNA , the new IkB-a protein synthesis observed subsequently was associated with a massive increase in IxB- « mRNA , which accords with the cycloheximide sensitivity of this IxB-a protein induction .
Induction of IxB-a by p65 and c-Rel .
The induction of IxB-a mRNA and protein shortly after activation of NF- « B suggested that NF- « B was directly responsible .
Undifferentiated NTera-2 human embryonic carcinoma cells were transfected with various plasmid constructs directing the synthesis of components of NF- « B .
These cells are devoid of NF- « B activity ( 9 ) and contained no detectable IxB-a protein or mRNA ( Fig .
5 A and B , respectively ) .
Transfection of NTera-2 cells with p65 , known to form potently transactivating homodimers ( 7 , 13 , 41 ) , generated high levels of endogenous IxB-a mRNA and protein expression ( Fig .
5 B and A , respectively ) .

presumably through a « B element .
It is formally possible , however , that the increase is mediated indirectly or is due to mRNA stabilization .
In contrast to p65 , transfection with p50 , which generates non-transactivating p50 homodimers ( 7 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 41 ) , did not induce IxB-a synthesis .
It is curious that transfection with the IxB-a expression construct did not result in detectable levels of the encoded protein ( Fig .
5A ) , despite the fact that high , functional levels of IxB-a can be expressed from this plasmid when cotransfected with potential targets for inhibition and binding , such as p65 ( 39 ) .
Binding to target proteins may therefore stabilize IxB- « , allowing its detection in Western blots .
We speculate further that the inherent instability of free IxB-a is the basis for its rapid removal from the cell upon activation-induced dissociation from NF- « B ( see Discussion ) .
Consistent with this notion , the transfection of pSO plus p65 and of c-Rel also induced considerable levels of IxB-a ( Fig .
5A ) , the respective dimers being capable of transactivation and being targets for binding and inhibition by IxB-a ( 11 , 20-24 , 31 , 42-45 ) .
Immunofluorescent staining of IxB-a confirmed the induction and cytoplasmic location of this protein in NTera-2 cells transfected with p65 or with p50/p65 ( Fig .
5C ) .
Staining for p65 revealed high levels of this protein in p65 transfected cells .
The distribution of p6S in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments suggested that the highly abundant exoge-nously introduced p65 is partially retained in the cytoplasm by the induced endogenous IkB-a .
DISCUSSION We show here that IxB-a is physiologically regulated by rapid removal from the cell in response to stimulation .
In three cell types tested-the monocytic cell line U937 , Jurkat T lym-phocytes , and peripheral blood T cells-IxB-a was present in unstimulated cells but disappeared within a few minutes of stimulation by PMA or TNF-a .
The removal of IkB-a is coupled to a concomitant translocation of NF- « B ( predom-inantly p50/p65 ) from the cytoplasm into the nucleus .
How does activation increase the lability of IxB-a protein ?
There are at least two possible explanations : ( i ) modification of IkB-a and/or its bound partners ( e.g. , p50/p65 ) , rendering it susceptible to hydrolysis by a cytoplasmic protease ; this increased susceptibility could result simply from the release of the modified IkB-a as a free , labile molecule ; ( i ? )
activation of a cytoplasmic protease with specificity for IxB-a @ .
Though not excluding the latter explanation , our data support the former .
The observation of a short-lived , more slowly migrating species of IxB-a in stimulated U937 cells suggests that modification of IxB-a « occurs and may precede dissociation from NF- « B and its degradation .
Secondly , because no I « B-a « protein could be demonstrated even upon transfection with IkB-a expression vectors in NTera-2 cells that lack NF- « B , IkB-a appears to be inherently unstable in the absence of NF- « B binding partners .
IxB-a is stabilized and readily detected in NTera-2 cells transfected with p65 , p50/p65 , or c-Rel .
Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that activation-induced modification of IxB-a and/or its bound NF- « B partner leads to dissociation of IxB-a « , rendering it susceptible to immediate protease attack .
The loss of IkB-a and the activation of NF- « B upon stimulation are transient phenomena .
IxB- « mRNA transcription is quickly induced , leading to replenishment of the IkB-a protein level .
The induction of endogenous IxB-a « mRNA upon transfection of NTera-2 cells with transactiva-tors such as p65 suggests direct transactivation of the IxB-a gene by NF- « B , possibly through a « B element .
Thus , p65 positively regulates IxB-a , probably by transcriptional acti-vation , and may also regulate IkB-a turnover by post-translational stabilization .
In addition to p65 homodimers , p50/p65 and c-Rel have similar effects on the induction of Proc .

Model depicting the mutual regulation of IxB-a and NF- « B .
Activation-induced IxB-a degradation is coupled to NF- « B nuclear translocation , which in turn leads to new IxB-a synthesis .
The broken line indicates possible recycling of nuclear NF- « B ( see text ) .
IkB-a , as may other Rel-related , transactivating combinations that can associate with IxB-a .
Our working model for NF- « B activation is shown in Fig .

Stimulation triggers signal transduction , which may lead to modification of IxB-a , probably by phosphorylation , and dissociation from cytoplasmic NF-kB .
Components of the NF- « B factor may also undergo modification assisting the release of IxB-a .
The resulting free , modified IxB-a is rapidly degraded by a protease .
NF- « B translocates to the nucleus , causing a pulse of « B-dependent transcription that is prolonged only if external stimulation continues .
IxB-a is likely to be one of the genes targeted by NF- « B , resulting in a surge of IxB-a mRNA synthesis , restoring its protein levels in the cell .
In the absence of further stimulation , the newly formed IxB-a may assist in removing nuclear NF- « B , since no NF- « B binding remains soon after elimination of the signal ( Fig .
2C ) .
This action of IxB-a could be the physiological role for the inhibitor 's ability to remove NF- « B from DNA in vitro .
Newly formed IxB- « may also sequester de novo synthesized NF-KB factors in the cytoplasm .
Activation-induced synthesis of components of NF-KB factors does not commence until well after 2 h of stimulation ( 5 , 9 , 44 , 45 ) .
The mutual regulation of IxB-a and NF- « B ensures that activation of NF- « B by environmental stimuli is limited- -and transient .
Activation of this transcription factor is subject to a negative feedback regulation through strong induction of IkB-a synthesis .
IxB-a production is geared to saturate its free NF- « B partners , acting to restore an equilibrium of inhibition following stimulation .
Any excess of free IxB-a is quickly degraded .
NF-KB and IxB-a are thus locked in a tightly controlled circuit of mutual regulation .
