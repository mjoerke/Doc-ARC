[ CANCER RESEARCH 54 , 1425-1430 , March 15 , 1994 ] Advances in Brief Hypoxia Causes the Activation of Nuclear Factor xB through the Phosphorylation of IxBa on Tyrosine Residues !
Albert C. Koong , Eunice Y. Chen , and Amato J. Giaccia* Cancer Biology Research Laboratory , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305-5468 Abstract The response of mammalian cells to stress is controlled by transcriptional regulatory proteins such as nuclear factor « B ( NF- « B ) to induce a wide variety of early response genes .
In this report , we show that exposure of cells to hypoxia ( 0.02 % O ; ) results in IxBa degradation , increased NF- « B DNA binding activity , and transactivation of a reporter gene construct containing two NF- « B DNA binding sites .
Pretreatment of cells with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the dominant negative allele of c-Raf-1 ( Raf 301 ) inhibited IxBa degradation , NF-xB binding , and transactivation of xB reporter constructs by hypoxia .
To demonstrate a direct link between changes in the phosphorylation pattern of IxBa with NF- « B activation , we immunoprecipitated IxBa after varying times of hypoxic exposure and found that its tyrosine phosphorylation status increased during hypoxic exposure .
Inhibition of the transfer of tyrosine phosphoryl groups onto IxBa prevented IxBa degradation and NF-B binding .
In comparison to other activators of NF-B such as phorbol myristate acetate or tumor necrosis factor , we did not detect changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of IxBa following treatment with either of these agents .
These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of IxBa during hypoxia is an important proximal step which precedes its dissociation and degradation from NF-B .
Introduction Cells maintain homeostasis by rapidly responding to changes in the extracellular environment .
Hypoxia , the condition of low oxygen , is one of the most basic environmental stresses that a cell may experi-ence .
It also has great clinical significance in that hypoxic cells within solid tumors contribute to the treatment failure of conventional radiotherapy and some forms of chemotherapy ( 1-3 ) .
By invoking protective mechanisms such as reduced macromolecular synthesis , cell cycle arrest , and selective gene induction , both transformed and untrans-formed cells protect themselves against fluctuations in environmental oxygen levels .
A number of genes have been shown to alter their expression as a result of transcription factors that are activated by hypoxia .
Some of these genes/transcription factors include glucose-regulated M , 78,000 protein by a glucose-responsive element ( 4 , 5 ) , erythropoietin by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( 6 , 7 ) , and heat shock protein 70 by the heat shock factor ( 8 ) .
However , little is known about the cellular signals which mediate the activation of transcription factors by hypoxia .
A growing number of stress-inducible genes have been shown to increase their expression through the activation of the transcription factor NF- « B° ( 9-11 ) .
A common feature of these early response genes is that their relatively rapid induction may be attributed to the Received 1/14/94 ; accepted 2/4/94 .

fact that NF- « B activation of gene transcription does not require de novo protein synthesis .
This feature of genes possessing NF- « B binding sites allows them to be well suited for the rapid synthesis of protective and signaling proteins after exposure to a wide variety of stresses ( 12-14 ) .
Understanding the activation of NF- « B has become increasingly more complicated with the discovery of an entire family of transcription factors that autoregulate themselves through subunit interaction ( 13 , 15-20 ) .
The regulation of the most common form of NF- « B involves the interaction of at least three distinct subunits , p50 , p65 , and IkBa .
In the cytoplasm , the major form of NF- « B is found in its inactive state with the inhibitory subunit , IxBa , bound to the p50-p65 heterodimer ( 12 ) .
Upon activation , IxBa is cleaved from the complex , and the p50-p65 heterodimer complex is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it binds with high affinity to a « B motif .
It is thought that the mammalian ReI/NF- « B proteins form homo- and heterodimers between different subunits which bind with different affinities to variants of the « B motif as a mechanism of regulating the cellular response to subtle changes in the environment ( 9-11 , 21 ) .
A further means to regulate the Rel/NF- « B proteins is accomplished through interactions with different forms of I « Ba , -B , -y , and bel-3 ( 22-28 ) .
What are the signals which cause the dissociation and depletion of IxBa and the nuclear translocation of NF- « B ?
In vitro studies have shown that phosphorylation of the IxBa subunit causes it to dissociate from the p50-p65 complex ( 29 ) .
Although protein kinase C has been implicated as one of the kinases responsible for the activation of NF- « B , it most likely is not the sole kinase involved in this pathway .
Other in vitro studies provide evidence that a cyclic AMP-dependent kinase and a heme-regulated kinase may also play a role in triggering NF- « B activation ( 29 , 30 ) .
Phosphorylation of IxBa has also been demonstrated in vivo , but the identity of the amino acids phosphorylated ( e.g. , serine , threonine , and/or tyrosine ) and the significance of this phosphorylation are still unclear ( 31 ) .
In summary , the data taken from several groups suggests that reactive oxygen intermediates cause the activation of membrane associated kinases such as src , ras , and raf .
These membrane-associated kinases signal other unknown kinase ( s ) which ultimately lead to the dissociation of IxBa and the activation of NF- « B .
Delineation of the pathway leading to NF-KB activation by hypoxia has important implications not only in understanding how HIV-1 viral replication is enhanced by low oxygen conditions ( 32 ) but also for investigating how the regulation of genes which contain NF- « B-binding sites are involved in the immune response and angiogenesis ( i.e. , TNFa , interleukin 2 , interleukin 6 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ) .
Since one common feature of many solid tumors is that fluctuations in blood flow lead to acute and chronic changes in oxygen concentration , then it is highly probable that shuttling between different oxygen tensions or chronic exposure to a low oxygen tension in the microenvironment of the tumors could increase the activation of NF- « B .

NF- « B ACTIVATION BY HYPOXIA In this paper , we investigated the kinetics of IxBa degradation , the nuclear translocation of p65 , the specific DNA binding of NF- « B to a « B motif , and the transactivation of CAT reporter constructs containing « B binding motifs during cellular exposure to hypoxia .
We also investigated whether the signal for IxBa degradation , NF- « B binding , and transactivation is mediated through protein tyrosine kinase ( s ) .
Our data suggest that the activation of NF- « B by hypoxia appears to represent an activation pathway different than that caused by PMA or TNF and that tyrosine phosphorylation of I « Ba is an important proximal step in the dissociation and degradation of this inhibitory molecule .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Treatments .
Jurkat T-cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum .
The following drug concentrations were used : 12-phorbol-13-myristate-acetate ( PMA , 1 um ; Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) , TNF ( 10 ng/ml , kindly provided by Dr. J. Elwell , Stanford University School of Medicine ) , staurosporine ( 1 um , Sigma ) , genistein ( 34-340 um ; Gibco/BRL , Gaithersberg , MD ) , and herbimycin A ( 50-500 nm ; Gibco/BRL ) .
Hypoxia Treatment .
As described elsewhere , cells were treated in 60-mm glass tissue culture dishes ( Corning ) with notched sides to allow gas exchange between the medium in the dish and the environment ( 8 ) .
The dishes were placed in specially designed aluminum hypoxia chambers that were prewarmed to 37°C , sealed , and subjected to successive rounds of evacuation followed by flushing with 95 % N ; /5 % CO ; while being slowly agitated on a reciprocating shaker .
The chambers were then placed in a 37°C incubator and kept on a reciprocating shaker for the duration of the hypoxic treatment .
The final oxygen concentration in the media after 5 cycles was reduced to 0.02 % .
Oxygen concentration was measured with a Clark-type electrode ( Controls Katharobic , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada ) .
In the combined drug and hypoxia treatments , cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C prior to the initiation of hypoxia .
Western Blot Analysis .
Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 137 mm NaCl , 20 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 8.0 ) , 2 mm EDTA , 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 mm sodium o-vanadate , 100 nm okadaic acid , 0.4 % Nonidet P-40 , 10 % glycerol , 10 ug/ml leupeptin , 1 ug/ml aprotinin , and 1 mg/ml pepstatin by sonication with 4.5-s pulses of 75 W while on ice .
To separate nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts , cells were lysed in the above mentioned buffer and incubated for 1 h on ice .
Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 X g for 20 min at 4°C , and both fractions were stored at -70°C for further analysis .
Protein concentrations of each sample were estimated by the bicinchinonic acid method ( Rockford , IL ) .
Cell extracts were mixed with 2X SDS sample buffer [ 62 mm Tris ( pH 6.8 ) -10 % glycerol-2 % SDS-5 % B-mercaptoethanol-0.003 % bromophenol blue ] , heated to 97°C for 5 min , and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
After electrophoresing for 2 h at 40 mA in a 10-12 % polyacrylamide gel , the gel was transferred onto Hybond ECL ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) for 2 h with the use of a Bio-Rad semidry transfer system .
The gels were then stained with 0.15 % Coomassie blue to ensure a uniform transfer .
The membranes were then probed with either I « Ba antibody ( kindly provided by Dr. Warner Greene , University of California at San Francisco ) , p65 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody ( UBI Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) .
The membranes were than autoradiographed utilizing enhanced chemillumines-cence according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Amersham ) .
Gel Mobility Shift Assays .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 10 mu Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) -10 mu KCI-1 mu PMSF-1.5 mm MgCl ; -1 mm DTT-2 ug/ml leupeptin-2 ug/ml aprotinin .
Cells were then homogenized and nuclei were collected by centrifugation ( 3000 rpm , 5 min ) .
The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in 25 mm Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) -0.44 m KCI-5 mm MgCl , -0.1 mm EDTA , 1 mm phenylmethylIsulfonyl fluoride-2 mm DTT-20 % glycerol .
The supernatant was then collected after centrifugation ( 31,000 rpm , 10 min ) .
A radiolabeled oligonucleotide with the sequence 5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTC-CCAGGC-3 ' was used in all of the NF- « B binding studies .
Six pug of nuclear extract ( as determined by the bicinchinonic assay method ) was used in each binding reaction .
The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 20 min in a buffer containing 500 ng sonicated salmon sperm , 10 mm Hepes ( pH 7.8 ) , 5 mm MgCl ; , 60 mm KCI , 0.5 mm DTT , 1 mm spermidine , and 10 % glycerol in a final volume of 20 ul .
Competitors were added in a 100-fold molar excess to demonstrate the specificity of the binding reaction .
After electrophoresis on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel ( 140 V , 2.5 h ) , the gel was dried onto Whatman filter paper and visualized by autoradiography ( Hyperfilm ; Amersham ) .
Transfection Studies .
Plasmid ( 10 pg ) DNA was electroporated ( Gene Pulser ; Bio-Rad ) into 1 X 10 '' Jurkat T-cells in a volume of 200 pl .
Cells were electroporated in media at 240 V with a capacitance of 960 uF and then incubated on ice for 10 min after electroporation before being plated into glass dishes for hypoxia treatment .
From 24 to 36 h after transfection , cells were exposed to hypoxia for 5 h and immediately lysed 3 h later for CAT activity analysis .
CAT activity was determined either by thin layer chromatography ( 33 ) as described previously ( 5 ) or by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
To eliminate differences in transfection efficiencies , transfected cells were pooled together ( for 24 h following electroporation ) before being split into separate groups for treatments .
All transfection experiments were performed 3-5 times .
Little fluctuation was seen among experiments .
Raf301 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Stambrook , University of Cinncinati School of Medicine .
Immunoprecipitation .
Protein A beads were allowed to swell for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate buffer ( 0.14 m Na ; HPO , -12H , 0-0.01 % NaN ) , pH 9.0 ) .
The beads were then washed 3 times with water and resuspended in a 50 % phosphate buffer solution .
The antibody was allowed to bind to the beads overnight ( 5 pl of antibody , 20 ul of protein A solution , and 400 pl of 1 % bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffer ) while being turned at 4°C .
The beads were then pelleted and washed twice with phosphate buffer .
Cell extract was then added to the beads and turned overnight at 4°C .
The beads were then pelleted and washed twice with phosphate buffer before being mixed with 2X SDS sample buffer and heated to 97°C .
After centrifugation to remove the beads , the supernatants with the immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed on a 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Western blotting as described above .
Results and Discussion To assess the dynamics of IxBa and NF-KB interactions under hypoxia , cells were exposed to varying durations of hypoxia ( 0.02 % ) and subcellular fractions were assayed by Western blot and gel mobility shift analysis for IxBa degradation ( Fig .
14 ) , p65 nuclear translocation ( Fig .
1B ) , and NF-KB binding ( Fig .
1C ) .
Fig .
14 shows that IxBa , a 37,000 M , cytoplasmic protein , disappears within 1-3 h after exposure to 0.02 % oxygen and reappears after 4 h. The antibody used to probe this immunoblot was raised against the COOH terminus of IxBa ( amino acids 289-317 ) and has been shown to recognize authentic IxBa protein ( 34 ) .
The kinetics for the disappearance of IxBa after hypoxia treatment was slower than that reported by Sun et al .
( 34 ) after cellular exposure to PMA or TNFa .
Because it has been shown previously that NF- « B controls the expression ( resynthesis of IxBa after degradation ) of the inhibitor IxBa by an inducible autoregulatory pathway , we found that the resynthesis of IxBa under hypoxic conditions ( 4-5 h ) is also slower than that following PMA or TNFa treatment ( Fig .
14 ) .
However , as has been found with other agonists of IxBa degradation , the resynthesis of IxBa during hypoxia is also inhibited by treatment of cells with cycloheximide ( data not shown ) .
The predominant protein complex of NF-KB in the cell is composed of homo- or heterodimers which form between proteins with molecular weights of 50,000 ( p50 subunit ) and 65,000 ( p65 subunit ) molecular weight .
To confirm that IxBa dissociation by hypoxia results in p65 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , nuclear extracts were assayed for an increase in p65 protein levels by Western blotting ( Fig .
1B ) .
The kinetics of p65 increasing in the nucleus mirrors the kinetics for IxBa disappearance in the cytoplasm .
A further indication of NF- « B activation by hypoxia is demonstrated by its binding to a 32P-labeled palindromic « B probe .
Fig .
1C shows that NF- « B binding increases during exposure to hypoxia .

1C ) .
To examine whether the increase in NF- « B binding induced by hypoxia was functionally able to transactivate genes that possess kB binding sites , we tested reporter gene plasmids possessing the full length HIV long terminal repeat promoter ( 35 ) and the same HIV long terminal repeat with two NF- « B mutations ( PkKBM ) ( 36 ) .
Jurkat T-cells were transiently transfected with either construct , exposed to 0.02 % oxygen for 5 h , and then assayed for CAT activity .
To minimize variations in plasmid transfection efficiencies , transfectants were pooled for 24 h after transfection , before separating them into various treatment groups .
The data shown represent the mean + SEM of 3-5 independent experiments .
Fig .
24 shows that cells transfected with HIV-CAT increased their CAT activity 3-fold after a 5-h exposure to hypoxia .
When the HIV-CAT plasmid construct containing 2 mutated « B sites ( PKBM ) was transfected , no transactivation by hypoxia was observed ( Fig .
24 ) .
Thus , hypoxia can activate NF-KB to bind DNA in a sequence specific manner and enhance transactivation of genes which possess « B-binding sites .
To this point , we have presented evidence that hypoxia causes the degradation of IxBa and the nuclear translocation of NF- « B and enhances the transcriptional activation of reporter constructs containing « B-binding sites .
Since previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of NF- « B by certain agonists can be inhibited by the use of protein kinase inhibitors ( 37 , 38 ) , cells were exposed simultaneously to 0.02 % oxygen in the presence or absence of protein kinase inhibitors .
The results from Fig .
2B show that NF- « B induction by hypoxia was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the general protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine , or the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein , suggesting that tyrosine kinases may be involved in NF-KB activation ( 39 ) .
Furthermore , the induction of NF- « B seemed to be induced by hypoxia itself and not reoxygenation inasmuch as these same inhibitors were only able to inhibit transac- tivation of HIV-CAT if they were added after hypoxia ( using a special hypoxia glove box ) , but before reoxygenation .
To further explore where in the pathway these protein kinase inhibitors were working , we analyzed the effect of these same protein kinase inhibitors on IxBa degradation and NF-KB activation .
Fig .
3 is a series of Western blots and gel mobility shift assays showing that hypoxia-induced IxBa degradation and NF-kB binding can be blocked by pretreating cells with these same protein kinase inhibitors .
Although staurosporine inhibits serine/threonine kinases , it also inhibits tyrosine kinase activity at the concentrations used in these studies ( 39 ) .
In contrast , genistein and herbimycin A are more specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( 39 ) .
These results suggest that tyrosine kinase ( s ) play an important role in the signaling pathway leading to NF-KB activation by hypoxia .
Recently , Beg et al .
( 31 ) have demonstrated the in vivo phosphorylation of IxBa after TNFa treatment of cells .

NF- « B ACTIVATION BY HYPOXIA Time under tated IxBa from cells that were exposed for varying times to hypoxia , Hypoxia ( hr ) electrophoresed the immunoprecipitates on a 12 % SDS polyacryl- 3 amide gel , and transferred them to Hybond nitrocellulose for immuno-blotting .
These membranes were then probed with antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues ( 40 , 41 ) .
We consistently found that IxBa exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation as a function of time exposed to hypoxia ( Fig .
4C ) .
This increase in tyrosine phosphorylation mirrored the kinetics of IkBa degradation in the cytoplasm .

In addition , we also performed these experiments using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to immunoprecipitate proteins from hypoxic treated cells , electrophoresed the immunoprecipitates on a 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel , and then probed immunoblots with antibody to IxBa .
We obtained the same results with either of the above described protocols .
Although these data indicate that the hypoxia-induced dissociation and degradation of I « Ba is mediated by its tyrosine phosphorylation status , it is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation could also be the signal for the degradation of IxBa by TNF or PMA treatment .
However , this seems unlikely unless IxBa is degraded more rapidly following phosphorylation in TNF- and PMA-treated cells than in hypoxia-treated cells .
In these Western blots , we are approaching the limits of sensitivity in detecting tyrosine phosphorylation of IxBa before degradation .

NF-xB ACTIVATION BY HYPOXIA pressing a dominant negative allele of Raf-1 ( Raf3O01 ) on the degradation of IxBa by hypoxia or TNF .
Raf301 is an inactive Raf-1 kinase that has the lysine of its ATP-binding site converted to tryptophan , eliminating its kinase activity .
Overexpression of Raf301 , therefore , acts as a dominant negative of Raf-1 by specifically competing for the same substrates as endogenous Raf-1 ( 42 ) .
The degradation of IxBa by hypoxia was almost completely inhibited by Raf301 in vivo but had less of an effect on I « Ba degradation by TNF ( Fig .
4D ) .
This is consistent with previous studies which have shown that Raf301 is a poor inhibitor of transactivation of a plasmid containing multiple « B-binding sites following treatment with TNF ( 43 ) .
Control trans-fections of cells with pRSVneo alone and subsequent exposure to hypoxia or TNF did not block IxBa degradation by either of these stresses ( Fig .
4B ) .
It is unlikely that Raf-1 kinase itself is directly phosphorylating IxBa as it is a serine/threonine kinase .
Instead Raf-1 is most likely part of a shared pathway involved in signaling IxBa degradation in vivo by diverse stresses ( 38 , 43 ) .
However , the path ways of NF- « B activation seem to diverge because TNF and PMA | '* do not result in detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of IxBa .
What is the physiological significance of NF- « B activation by - 11. hypoxia in a tumor ?
Once a tumor grows beyond 100 mm in diameter , it may develop areas of hypoxia since O ; and nutrients will poorly | 12. diffuse beyond this distance .
Because diffusion of O ; is a limiting factor in the growth of a tumor , the tumor secretes chemotactic signals | ; ; in the form of growth factors and cytokines to induce neovascular-ization ( 44 ) .
Many of the cytokines involved in this process possess - '* NF- « B-binding elements ( 45-47 ) .
The induction of NF- « B by hypoxia fits its role as a genetic regulatory mechanism activated in - 15. response to the stress of low oxygen conditions .
In the case of a rapidly dividing tumor , the activation of NF- « B would be essential for _ 16 , the recruitment of new blood vessels so that the growth of the tumor is not impeded by a lack of O ; , and other essential nutrients .
In addition , there is evidence that the p65 subunit plays a role in medi- - 17. ating cellular adhesion and tumorigenesis ( 48 ) .
In that regions of hypoxia are a common feature of many solid tumors , hypoxia may | 1s , also contribute to tumorigenesis through its activation of NF-KB .
Solid tumors undergo sporadic opening and closing of their vascula- - , , ture resulting in areas of acute hypoxia which experience a burst of free radicals upon reoxygenation ( 49 ) .
Since oxidative stress and hypoxia are potent activators of NF- « B , both factors could act to 20 increase the activation of NF- « B in solid tumors .
21 .
The work presented in this paper shows that tyrosine phosphorylation is a required event for NF- « B activation by hypoxia .
Further- - ; ; more , hypoxia appears to modulate the cascade of events leading to NF- « B activation in a different manner than other stresses such as 23 treatment with PMA or TNF .
These results do not preclude the possibility that other stresses or cytokines mediate IxBa dissociation - 24 directly through a serine/threonine phosphorylation event .
In fact , the phosphorylation of IxBa on serine or tyrosine residues may be the - 25 mechanism that differentially regulates its degradation after different stresses .
Identification of the tyrosine kinase involved in phosphory- _ , , lating IxBa by hypoxia would present a potential therapeutic target to inhibit NF- « B-mediated gene expression in solid tumors .
