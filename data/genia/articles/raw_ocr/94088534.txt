1 The Macrophage Transcription Factor PU.1 Directs Tissue-Specific Expression of the Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor DONG-ER ZHANG , CHRISTOPHER J. HETHERINGTON , HUI-MIN CHEN , anp DANIEL G. TENEN* Division of Hematology/Oncology , Department of Medicine , Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Received 12 July 1993/Returned for modification 26 August 1993/Accepted 22 September 1993 The macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion from two distinct promoters in monocytes/macrophages and the placenta .
In order to further understand the transcription factors which play a role in the commitment of multipotential progenitors to the monocyte/ macrophage lineage , we have initiated an investigation of the factors which activate the M-CSF receptor very early during the monocyte differentiation process .
Here we demonstrate that the human monocytic M-CSF receptor promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion .
Since one of the few transcription factors which have been implicated in the regulation of monocyte genes is the macrophage- and B-cell-specific PU.1 transcription factor , we investigated whether PU.1 binds and activates the M-CSF receptor promoter .
Here we demonstrate that both in vitro-translated PU.1 and PU.1 from nuclear extracts bind to a specific site in the M-CSF receptor promoter just upstream from the major transcription initiation site .
Mutations in this site which eliminate PU.1 binding decrease M-CSF receptor promoter activity significantly in macrophage cell lines only .
Furthermore , PU.1 transactivates the M-CSF receptor promoter in nonmacrophage cells .
These results suggest that PU.1 plays a major role in macrophage gene regulation and development by directing the expression of a receptor for a key macrophage growth factor .
The 150-kDa receptor of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor is encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene , the cellular counterpart of the Susan McDonough strain of the feline sarcoma virus v-fms gene ( 36 ) .
The M-CSF receptor is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein with an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain ( 5 ) .
The precise mechanism of intracellular signalling produced by the M-CSF receptor has not yet been characterized .
However , many experiments have demonstrated that it is required for the differentiation , proliferation , and survival of monocytic phagocytes ( 35 ) .
Point mutations in the extracellular domain enable the receptor to convert NIH 3T3 cells to transformed tumorigenic cells ( 30 , 42 ) .
Some of these same point mutations have been detected in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia , diseases characterized by the failure of differentiation of monocytic precursors ( 27 , 39 ) .
In humans , the M-CSF receptor gene is located on chromosome 5 at band 5q33.3 , and deletions of this region have been reported in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia ( 18 ) .
In addition to mutations in the coding region , alterations in expression of the M-CSF receptor affect macrophage development .
The integration of Friend murine leukemia virus into the 5 end of the murine M-CSF receptor gene results in the high expression of a normal-sized receptor and can induce murine myeloblastic leukemia ( 10 ) .
In normal tissues , M-CSF receptor expression is restricted to monocytes/macrophages and placental trophoblast cells ( 35 ) .
However , the regulation of its expression differs between these two tissues ( 28 , 29 , 40 ) .

373 direct M-CSF receptor tissue-specific expression in the two different tissues ( 29 ) .
In monocytes , transcription initiates at multiple sites immediately upstream of the start codon ATG .
In placental cells , however , transcription starts 26 kb upstream and includes an additional noncoding exon .
M-CSF receptor expression can be detected in the very early stages of myeloid differentiation and increases dramatically during this differentiation process ( 7 , 11 , 32 ) .
This pattern of expression , as well as the functional importance of the M-CSF receptor cited above , suggests that expression of the receptor plays a critical role in the process of monocytic differentiation .
However , the transcription factors directing the differentiation of pluripotential progenitor cells to the monocytic lineage are still poorly understood .
The ets family member PU.1 was originally isolated as the Spi-1 oncogene , in which its overexpression in early erythroid cells blocked erythro-blast differentiation ( 17 , 34 ) .
PU.1 is specifically expressed in B cells and monocytes ( 15 ) .
In B cells , PU.1 recruits a second B-cell-specific DNA binding factor ( NF-EMS ) to a site important for immunoglobulin xk 3 ' enhancer activity ( 24 ) , and phosphorylation of a specific serine residue ( Ser-148 ) in PU.1 is critical for the interaction between PU.1 and NF-EMS ( 25 ) .
In monocytes , PU.1 binding plays a critical role in myeloid-cell-specific expression of CD11b ( MAC-1 receptor alpha chain ) , a gene expressed late during the course of monocytic differentiation ( 22 ) .
To investigate the mechanism of M-CSF receptor monocyte-specific expression , we studied the function of PU.1 on M-CSF receptor promoter activity .
Our results indicate that PU.1 plays a critical role in the monocytic expression of the human M-CSF receptor and suggest that PU.1 may therefore play a critical role in monocyte development .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture .
Human monoblastic U937 cells ( ATCC CRL 1593 ; American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , Md . )
and T-lymphoblastic REX cells ( provided by James Griffin , Dana Farber Cancer Institute ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( GIBCO , Grand Island , N.Y. ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( HyClone , Logan , Utah ) and 2 mM L-glutamine ( GIBCO ) .
Human promonocytic THP-1 cells ( ATCC TIB 202 ) were grown in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( HyClone ) , 2 mM L-glutamine ( GIBCO ) , and 2 x 10~° M 2-mercaptoethanol .
The human Mono Mac 6 cells ( provided by H. W. L. Ziegler-Heitbrock ) were propagated as described previously ( 45 ) .

Nuclear run-on transcription assay .
Nuclear run-on assays were performed as previously described ( 33 ) .
Slot blots were prepared with the following DNA probes : the plasmid pBR322 , a 2-kb Pstl fragment of the chicken actin cDNA in pBR322 ( 4 ) , a 1.3-kb fragment containing the full length rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase cloned in the PstI site of pUC18 ( 8 ) , and a 4-kb EcoRI fragment containing human M-CSF receptor cDNA in pGEM ( 5 ) .
Isolation of the human M-CSF receptor monocytic promoter .
The sequence 5 ' of exon 2 of the human M-CSF receptor gene was amplified and cloned from HindIII-di-gested human genomic DNA by PCR based on the published sequence ( 29 ) with primer A , 5-CGGGATCCAGATATG CATTACTTTGGAGATTCCAAGG-3 ' , and primer B , 5'-GGGGTACCCCTCGGTGGGGAAGTGGCA-3 ' .
This PCR fragment was sequenced and found to be identical with the published genomic sequence .
The synthesized fragment is 540 bp long , extending at its 3 ' end to within 3 bp upstream of the translation start site ( Fig .
1 ) .
With the most 5° major transcription start site in monocytic cells designated as position +1 , this fragment represents bp -416 to +124 of the 5 ' upstream M-CSF receptor sequence and contains 178 bp of exon 2 ( 29 ) .
The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and KpnI and cloned into the vector pXP2 ( 19 ) .
This construct is referred to as p540M-CSF-R-luc ( Fig .
1 ) .
Transient transfections .
U937 , Mono Mac 6 , and REX cells were transfected by electroporation in RPMI 1640 medium at 960 wF and 300 , 230 , and 280 V , respectively .
HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation in Iscove 's modified Eagle 's medium at 960 wF and 150 V. The detailed transfection procedures were as described previously ( 20 ) .
Cells were harvested 5 h posttransfection in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer , and luciferase assays were performed as previously described ( 21 , 22 ) .
Transfection efficiency was normalized to the levels of growth hormone expressed from 2 pg of cotransfected plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus promoter directing human growth hormone gene expression ( RSV-hGH ) , and data are expressed as relative light units per nanogram of growth hormone .
Growth hormone concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay ( Nicol 's Insti-tute , San Juan Capistrano , Calif. ) .
Nuclear extracts .
U937 cells were grown to a concentration of 6 x 10°/ml and harvested for nuclear protein extraction .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described ( 44 ) .
Approximately 15 mg of nuclear protein was prepared from 10° cells .
DNase I footprinting .
For DNase I footprinting assay , a 540-bp DNA fragment extending from bp -416 to +124 of the M-CSF receptor promoter was digested with BamHI and Xhol to release the promoter fragment from the vector pXP2 and was *P labeled as described previously ( 44 ) .
PU.1 protein was in vitro translated from plasmid p25.1 ( 15 ) with the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system ( L4610 ; Vor .
14 , 1994 Promega ) according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
DNase I footprinting was performed as previously described ( 44 ) .
Ten microliters of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate or in vitro-translated PU.1 or 90 pug of nuclear protein from U937 cells was incubated with radiolabeled DNA probe in the presence of 4 ug of double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) in a total of 20 ul of binding buffer ( 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] [ pH 7.9 ] , 30 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl , , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM EDTA , 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 12 % glycerol ) .
Binding reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 0°C .
EMSA .
P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) were prepared as previously described ( 22 ) .
DNA binding conditions were identical to those for DNase I footprinting , except for the addition of 1 g of double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) .
Reactions were electrophoresed at 10 V/cm on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel ( bisacrylamide/acrylamide ratio = 1:29 ) in 0.5 % TBE ( 45 mM Tris-borate , 1 mM EDTA ) at 4°C .
For supershift experiments , a 1-pl portion of a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against PU.1 was added to the nuclear extract and preincu-bated for 15 min prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe ( see Fig .
5 ) .
The serum was raised against a 13-amino-acid peptide of PU.1 ( amino acids 33 to 45 of the mouse PU.1 protein [ 15 ] ) and supershifts the full-length human PU.1 protein ( 22 ) but not the related family member Spi-B ( 26 ) .
Methylation interference analysis .
Methylation interference assays were performed as previously described ( 3 ) .
The DNA probe was labeled on the 5° end of the noncoding-strand oligonucleotide TCGAGCTGATCCTCTITTCTITTCCCC TTTTAGCTAGG .
Site-directed mutagenesis .
The wild-type M-CSF receptor promoter-luciferase construct p40M-CSF-R-luec was digested with Sacl and religated to delete a 65-bp fragment and construct pM-CSF-R-luc , which includes -416 to +71 of the M-CSF receptor promoter region .
The -416-to-+124 and -416-to-+71 fragments had identical promoter activities when p540M-CSF-R-luec and pM-CSF-R-luc were used in transient transfection experiments ( data not shown ) .
Mutations in the PU.1 site at bp -40 of the M-CSF receptor promoter were generated with oligonucleotides carrying point mutations ( 43 ) .
The mutated M-CSF receptor promoter fragment was generated by PCR .
Plasmid p540M-CSF-R-luc was used as a template with primer A ( shown above ) and primer C ( 5-GGGGTACCGATCCCTTITAGCTAGG-3 '' ) to generate PCR fragment 1 and with primer B ( shown above ) and primer D to generate PCR fragment 2 .
PCR fragment 1 was digested with BamHI and KpnI .
PCR fragment 2 was digested with KpnI and Sacl .
Both digested PCR fragments were ligated with BamHI- and Sacl-digested vector pXP2 to construct pM-CSF-R ( m40 ) -luc .
The sequence of the mutant construct was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method ( 31 ) .
The mutated construct pM-CSF-R ( m40 ) -luec changed the sequence GAAGAAGAG at bp -45 to -37 to ATCGGTA CC .
Transactivation of promoter in HeLa cells .
HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously ( 2 ) with 10 ug of reporter plasmid , with and without 1 pg of the PU.1 expression vector PUpECE ( 15 ) , with 0.25 ug of RSV-hGH plasmid , and with sonicated double-stranded salmon sperm DNA to a total of 20 ug of DNA .

Tissue-specific transcriptional activity of the M-CSF receptor in hematopoietic cells .
Nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed with nuclei from REX ( T-cell ) and THP-1 ( mono-cytic ) cells as described in Materials and Methods .
Nascent radiolabeled transcripts were hybridized to nitrocellulose membranes containing a molar excess of the indicated cDNA probes .
RESULTS The M-CSF receptor is specifically transcribed in monocytic cell lines .
Previous investigators have demonstrated M-CSF receptor transcriptional activity in monocytic cell lines such as HL-60 , but posttranscriptional mechanisms played a significant role in the accumulation of stable M-CSF receptor RNA following monocytic differentiation with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( 41 ) .
These results raised the possibility that the tissue specificity of M-CSF receptor RNA expression was not mediated by the promoter .
In order to demonstrate that transcriptional mechanisms play a role in monocyte-specific expression , we compared transcriptional activities detected by nuclear run-on assays in monocytic ( THP-1 ) lines with those in nonmonocytic ( REX T-cell ) lines .
As demonstrated in Fig .
2 , M-CSF receptor transcriptional activity was detected only in the monocytic cell line ( THP-1 ) , suggesting that the promoter was at least partly responsible for monocyte-specific expression .
In addition to the activity with THP-1 cells , we detected run-on activity in the promonocytic U937 cell line which was also significantly greater than that seen in Rex cells ( data not shown ) .
The M-CSF receptor promoter is tissue specific .
To analyze the region 5° of exon 2 for monocytic promoter activity , a DNA fragment spanning from -416 to +124 of the human M-CSF receptor gene was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pXP2 to form p540M-CSF-R-luc ( Fig .
1 and 3 ) .
Promoter activities were monitored by luciferase assays after transfection into the human promonocytic U937 and Mono Mac 6 cell lines and compared with those following transfection of the human nonmyeloid cell lines REX ( early T-cell ) and HeLa ( cervical carcinoma ) .
All luciferase values were corrected for transfection efficiency by cotransfection of RSV-hGH .
In promonocytic cells , the M-CSF receptor 5 ' flanking region demonstrated very strong promoter activity .
The luciferase activity of p540M-CSF-R-luec was 100- to 300-fold higher than that of the pXP2 promoterless con-struct .
Comparative analysis revealed that this promoter functions 25- to 100-fold more efficiently in promonocytic cells than in nonmyeloid cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
These results demonstrated that the 5 ' flanking region of the M-CSF receptor 376 ZHANG ET AL .

Tissue specificity of the M-CSF receptor promoter in transient transfection .
p540M-CSF-R-luc , as well as the promoterless pXP2 vector , was transfected into M-CSF receptor-expressing U937 and Mono Mac 6 cells and into M-CSF receptor-negative REX and HeLa cells .
One-fifth of the transfected cells were assayed for luminescence 5 h later .
Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting RSV-hGH , and relative light units were normalized on the basis of the amount of growth hormone released into the culture medium .

gene ( bp -416 to +124 ) contains strong tissue-specific promoter activity .
The macrophage- and B-cell-specific factor PU.1 binds to the M-CSF receptor promoter at a site just upstream of the major 5° monocytic transcription start site .
As mentioned above , PU.1 is a member of the ets transcription factor family and is predominantly expressed in macrophages and B cells .
If PU.1 is a major determinant of the myeloid lineage , it might be expected to regulate a number of myeloid-cell-specific genes , including the M-CSF receptor , a lineage-specific growth factor receptor required for monocytic development .
To investigate this hypothesis , we used in vitro-translated PU.1 protein in a DNase I footprinting assay with the monocytic M-CSF receptor promoter fragment ( Fig .
4 ) .
The results demonstrated that in vitro-translated PU.1 protein specifically protected a purine-rich site extending from bp -33 to -51 of the M-CSF receptor promoter ( Fig .
1 ) .
This purine-rich site was also protected with nuclear protein extracts from U937 cells ( Fig .
4 , lane U ) .
To verify whether PU.1 is the factor in nuclear extracts from myeloid cells which interacts with this site , a gel shift experiment with a double-stranded oligonucleotide extending from bp -30 to -59 was performed , with the results shown in Fig .
5A .
The U937 nuclear extract gave a major shifted band ( Fig .
5A , lane 4 ) that had the same relative migration as that observed with in vitro-translated PU.1 protein ( lane 3 ) .
This band can be inhibited by competition with unlabeled self oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5A , lane 5 ) and a known PU.1-binding oligonucleotide from the simian virus 40 enhancer ( lane 6 ) but not by a non-PU.1-binding oligonucleotide containing an Spl site ( lane 7 ) .
When a polyclonal antibody against an N-terminal PU.1 peptide was added to the binding reaction , we detected a loss of the full-length PU.1 band and the appearance of a supershifted band ( Fig .
5A , lane 8 ) .
In the nuclear extracts , several specific complexes which migrate faster than in vitro-translated PU.1 protein and do not supershift with the antibody are ob-served ; these have been observed previously ( 9 , 22 , 34 ) and represent DNA-binding complexes formed by proteolytic products of PU.1 .

These results demonstrate that PU.1 specifically binds to the M-CSF receptor promoter at a site between bp -30 and -59 .
The observed complex which migrates more slowly than the full-length PU.1 complex is likely a nonspecific band , since it can not be eliminated by excess self oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5 , lane 5 ) .
To define the residues on the M-CSF receptor promoter contacted by the PU.1 protein , methylation interference assays were performed , with the results shown in Fig .
5C .
The results indicate that the four G residues at bp -48 to -45 directly contact the PU.1 protein .
A mutation of the PU.1 site which abolishes PU.1 binding decreases the expression of the M-CSF receptor promoter in monocytic cells .
To verify the importance of the PU.1 binding site for monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor expression , the site was mutated as shown in Fig .
6 .
An oligonucleotide with a mutated PU.1 site could not inhibit PU.1 binding to the wild-type region from bp -59 to -30 ( Fig .
6 ) .
The same PU.1 mutant-site oligonucleotide did not bind to in vitro-translated PU.1 or PU.1 from U937 nuclear extracts in gel shift assays ( data not shown ) .
This mutation was then introduced into the M-CSF receptor promoter-luciferase construct to form pM-CSF-R ( m40 ) -luc .
Transient transfection experiments comparing the wild-type plasmid pM-CSF-R-luc and the mutant pM-CSF-R ( m40 ) -luc demonstrated that mutation of the PU.1 binding site reduced promoter activity to 16 % of that of the wild-type promoter in promonocytic U937 cells and had no effect on the low-level promoter activity in the REX cell line , which does not express PU.1 ( Fig .

These results demonstrate that PU.1 binds to the promoter at a functionally critical site .
PU.1 activates the M-CSF receptor promoter in nonmonocytic cells .
To demonstrate that PU.1 is critical for M-CSF receptor promoter activity , cotransactivation experiments were performed with the nonmyeloid HeLa cell line , which lacks endogenous PU.1 activity ( 15 , 22 , 23 ) .

PU.1 stimulates transcription from the M-CSF receptor promoter in transactivation assays .
PU.l-negative HeLa cells were transfected by the Ca , ( PO , ) ; precipitation method with 10 ug of the promoterless luciferase construct pXP2 , the wild-type M-CSF receptor promoter construct ( pM-CSF-R-luc ) , or the PU.1 mutant M-CSF receptor promoter construct [ pM-CSF-R ( m40 ) -luc ] .
These constructs were cotransfected with or without the PU.1 expression vector PUpECE .
Luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection .
PU.1 induction of luciferase activity represents the luciferase activity in the presence of cotransfected PU.1 divided by that obtained in the absence of PU.1 .
Luciferase activities are normalized for transfection efficiency with the cotransfected growth hormone plasmid RSV-hGH .
The data are the means for three to five experiments .
The standard errors of the means are indicated by the error bars .
PU.1-binding-site-mutated M-CSF receptor luciferase construct pM-CSF-R ( m40 ) -luec were transfected separately into HeLa cells with and without cotransfection of the PU.1 expression plasmid PUpECE .
The results are shown in Fig .
8 .
All luciferase values were normalized to the level of growth hormone production to correct for any variation in transfection efficiency .
In the absence of PU.1 expression , wild-type and PU.1-binding-site-mutated M-CSF receptor promoters had the same level of promoter activity in HeLa cells ; in contrast , the level of activity in U937 cells was lower when the PU.1 site was mutated ( Fig .
7 ) .
In the presence of cotransfected PU.1 , the wild-type M-CSF receptor promoter activity increased fivefold in HeLa cells , while the PU.1-binding-site-mutated promoter showed no increase .
When a retinoic acid receptor B expression plasmid ( 1 ) was cotransfected with the wild-type M-CSF receptor luciferase construct , there was no effect on promoter activity ( data not shown ) .
These data and the results of the DNA binding assays described above ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) demonstrate that the interaction of transcription factor PU.1 and the M-CSF receptor promoter is essential for monocytic promoter activity .
DISCUSSION M-CSF receptor expression is limited to the monocyte/ macrophage lineage in the hematopoietic system .
The level of M-CSF receptor RNA increases specifically when human CD34+ multipotential progenitors are induced to differentiate into early myeloid cells with granulocyte M-CSF but not when the same progenitor population is induced toward erythroid differentiation with erythropoietin ( 40a ) .
Others have shown that when committed promonocytic cell lines like HL-60 are induced with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate to differentiate into nondividing macrophage-like cells , M-CSF receptor RNA increases significantly but transcription rates do not , suggesting that receptor RNA is upregulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms ( 41 ) .
Recent results have suggested a transcriptional upregulation of the M-CSF receptor in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with retinoic acid ( 14 ) .
Here we have demonstrated that M-CSF receptor transcription can be detected by run-on analysis in monocytic lines but not in nonmonocytic ( T-cell ) lines , indicating that the promoter is important for lineage-specific expression .
Others have previously isolated the placental and monocytic M-CSF receptor promoter ( 29 ) .
In those experiments , the addition of a strong simian virus 40 enhancer was necessary to demonstrate monocyte-specific expression , making a detailed analysis of the functional elements of the promoter difficult .
Using optimized transfection protocols , we have been able to demonstrate that the monocyte promoter in the absence of a heterologous enhancer has significant tissue-specific activity .
Sequence analysis of the promoter suggested the presence of three potential binding sites for the PU.1 transcription factor ( 29 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
However , as was the case for the myeloid-cell-specific CD11b promoter ( 22 ) , we were unable to demonstrate PU.1 binding to those sites .
Instead , PU.1 protein , whether in vitro translated or isolated from nuclear extracts , bound to a distinct purine-rich site ( Fig .
1 , 4 , and 5 ) which does not contain this specific sequence .
However , methylation interference analysis indicates that four G residues in the M-CSF receptor promoter directly interact with PU.1 , a pattern quite similar to the three G residues identified as contact points in the major histocompatibility complex class II PU.1 binding site ( 15 ) .
Further analysis with additional point mutants of the CD11b and M-CSF receptor binding sites will be necessary to determine which additional bases are important for PU.1 binding .
When this PU.1 binding site in the M-CSF receptor promoter was mutated , the promoter activity decreased dramatically only in monocytic cells ( U937 ) and remained unchanged at low levels in both REX and HeLa cells .
When 380 ZHANG ET AL .
PU.1 is expressed in HeLa cells , it can transactivate a cotransfected wild-type M-CSF receptor promoter but not the PU.1-binding-site-mutated promoter .
All of these results suggest that PU.1 binds to a site other than 5'-GAGGAA-3 ' and directs M-CSF receptor promoter activity in monocytic cells .
As is the case for CD11b ( 22 ) , PU.1 binds to a site just upstream of the major transcriptional start site in a promoter which lacks a consensus TATAA box or initiator sequence ( 37 ) .
The finding that PU.1 binds specifically to TATAA-binding protein in vitro ( 12 ) raises the possibility that part of the function of PU.1 in these promoters is to recruit TFIID and subsequently the other components of the basal transcriptional machinery to a promoter lacking TATAA , the TATAA-binding protein binding site .
Whether this will be a common mechanism in other monocytic genes regulated by PU.1 remains to be determined .
While many of the ets family transcription factors interact with another protein to form a complex with DNA ( 6 , 13 , 38 ) and PU.1 itself has been demonstrated to form a complex with the B-cell factor NF-EMS to activate the immunoglobulin « 3 ' enhancer ( 24 ) , our gel shift experiments with the PU.1 site of CD11b ( 22 ) and with the M-CSF receptor promoter suggest that PU.1 binds these two monocyte promoters in the absence of a stable complex with another protein .
In addition , in contrast to the case in B cells ( 25 ) , we were unable to detect any significant effect of a serine-to-alanine mutation at position 148 ( or at positions 41 , 45 , 132 , and 133 ) ( kindly provided by M. Klemsz and R. Maki ) on the ability of PU.1 expression constructs to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter in HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
Whether these differences reflect an inherent distinction between the ways in which PU.1 works in B cells and in myeloid cells or whether it reflects a distinct mechanism of PU.1 action in these TATAA-less myeloid genes remains unknown .
While we have demonstrated that PU.1 plays an important role in the monocytic expression of the M-CSF receptor promoter , the fact that PU.1 plays a similarly important role in a gene expressed in both monocytes and neutrophils ( CD11b ) and in B-cell gene expression suggests that other factors may play a significant role in M-CSF receptor monocyte-specific expression .
In vitro DNase I footprinting demonstrates that , as in the case of CD11b , there is an Spl binding site just upstream of the PU.1 site in the M-CSF receptor promoter ( 44a ) .
Whether , as is the case for CD11b ( 3 ) , Spl binds in a myeloid-cell-specific fashion in vivo to activate the M-CSF receptor remains to be determined by in vivo footprinting and transfection experiments .
In addition , we have detected two sites upstream of the PU.1 site which are strongly protected in in vitro DNase I footprinting analysis with extracts from myeloid cells but not from HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
The identity and functional significance of these myeloid-cell-specific binding activities remain to be determined .
The monocyte-specific expression of M-CSF receptor may require a combination of the effects of the monocyte- and B-cell-specific PU.1 factor and other tissue-specific factor ( s ) , including factors which interact with DNA elements outside the 540-bp promoter region tested .
The identification of a functionally significant PU.1 binding site in the CD11ib and M-CSF receptor promoter demonstrate that at least two important monocytic genes are regulated by PU.1 .
PU.1 mRNA , like that of the M-CSF receptor , is strongly and specifically upregulated as CD34+ progenitors are specifically differentiated into myeloid cells Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
( 40a ) .
PU.1 upregulation precedes that of CD11b and the M-CSF receptor by days , suggesting that PU.1 upregulation may be an important early event in myeloid commitment and differentiation .
Inactivation or disruption of the PU.1 gene will help to determine whether PU.1 expression and upregulation is necessary for myeloid development , and further analysis of monocytic promoters such as the M-CSF receptor should lead to the identification of other factors which play a role in the development of this lineage .
