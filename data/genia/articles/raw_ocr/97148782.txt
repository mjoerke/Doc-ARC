As a step toward elucidating the pathophysiological background of the so-called glucose toxicity to pancreatic B cells , we induced glycation in HIT-T15 cells using a sugar with strong deoxidizing activity , D-ribose , and examined the effects on insulin gene transcription .
The results of reporter gene analyses revealed that the insulin gene promoter is more sensitive to glycation than the control B-actin gene promoter ; ~ 50 and 80 % of the insulin gene promoter activity was lost when the cells were kept for 3 d in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose , respectively .
In agreement with this , decrease in the insulin mRNA and insulin content was observed in the glycation-induced cells .
Also , gel mobility shift analyses using specific antiserum revealed decrease in the DNA-binding activity of an insulin gene transcription factor , PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1 .
These effects of D-ribose seemed almost irreversible but could be prevented by addition of 1 mM aminoguanidine or 10 mM N-acetylcysteine , thus suggesting that glycation and reactive oxygen species , generated through the glycation reaction , serve as mediators of the phenomena .
These observations suggest that protein glycation in pancreatic B cells , which occurs in vivo under chronic hyperglycemia , suppresses insulin gene transcription and thus can explain part of the B cell glucose toxicity .

reveal extensive degranulation , thus suggesting impaired insulin biosynthesis as a cause of the phenomenon ( 3 ) .
The clinical significance of this phenomenon is supported by the association between the development of diabetes and the substantial reduction of insulin content in B cells in model animals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) !
( 4 , 5 ) .
Despite the fact that glucose toxicity has long been a well-recognized clinical concept , its biochemical background is poorly understood .
While technical difficulties have prevented extensive in vivo research , a line of in vitro studies using B cell-derived HIT-T15 cells that were kept under high glucose conditions for a very long period ( > 25 passages ) has provided useful information as to the possible mechanisms underlying the decrease in insulin biosynthesis ( 6-9 ) .
According to the results of those studies , long-term exposure to high glucose concentration caused the HIT-T15 cells to suppress insulin gene promoter activity , and led to decreases in insulin mRNA amount , insulin content , and capacity for insulin secretion .
These observations support the idea that reduction of the promoter activity may play a primary role in the impairment of insulin biosynthesis and suggest the potential usefulness of such in vitro systems for the study of the molecular aspects of B cell glucose toxicity .
To enable effective prevention and treatment of glucose toxicity to B cells , it would be essential to understand the biochemical aspects of the phenomenon .
In terms of glucose-induced cell damage , several possible mechanisms have been proposed to date , including increased osmolarity , an activated sorbitol pathway , and an activated glycation reaction ( 10 , 11 ) .
Among them , glycation seems to have broad pathological sig-nificance : various glycated proteins such as glycosylated hemo-globin , albumin , and lens crystalline are nonenzymatically produced through the Maillard reaction ( 12-14 ) .
These can be observed even under physiological conditions in vivo , but they increase under hyperglycemic conditions ( 12 , 13 , 15 ) .
In diabetic animals , glycation is observed extensively in various organs and tissues including the kidney , liver , brain , and lung ( 12 , 16 ) .
During the Maillard reaction , which in turn produces Schiff base , Amadori product and advanced glycosylation end products ( AGE ) , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are also pro-duced , and this is suggested to be involved in tissue damage ( 17 , 18 ) .
In the present study , we examined the possible effects of glycation on insulin gene transcription using a sugar with powerful reducing activity , D-ribose ( 19 , 20 ) .
Co-use of aminoguanidine , which binds to the Amadori product or 3-deoxy- 1 .
Abbreviations used in this paper : AGE , advanced glycosylation end products ; NAC , N-acetylcysteine ; NIDDM , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ; ROS , reactive oxygen species ; RSV-LTR , Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat .
glucosone and inhibits the glycation reaction ( 21 , 22 ) , and N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , an antioxidant ( 23 , 24 ) , allowed us to show that glycation and the consequent increase of ROS are potential suppressors of the insulin gene promoter .
Significant reduction of the DNA-binding activity of a transcription factor , PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1 ( 25 , 26 ) , was also observed in glycation-induced cells , suggesting that the high sensitivity of the insulin gene transcription factors to glycation or ROS may underlie the suppression of the insulin gene promoter activity .

For the purpose of examining the reversibility of the -ribose effects on the cells , HIT-T15 cells were kept for 5 d under 40 mM D-ribose and then without D-ribose for 2 or 5 d. 3 g of each nuclear extract was preincubated with 1 g of poly ( dI-dC ) at 4°C in a 20-pl reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT and 3 % Ficoll ( vol/vol ) .

No significant changes were observed with the B-actin gene promoter ( 112+12 and 87+14 % for 40 and 60 mM D-ribose , respectively ; Fig .

In terms of the RSV-LTR promoter , an increase was observed in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose ( 252+60 and 258+95 % , respectively ; Fig .

To verify that the suppression of the insulin gene promoter activity by D-ribose is relevant to the induction of glycation by D-ribose , we observed the effects of D-ribose while inhibiting glycation using 1 mM aminoguanidine .

to complete or partial neutralization of the promoter-suppress-ing effects ( 48+19 to 108+10 % for 40 mM D-ribose ; 18+6 to 67+18 % for 60 mM D-ribose ; Fig .
2 A and Table I ) .
Regarding the RSV-LTR promoter activity , aminoguanidine at least partially blocked the D-ribose-responsive increase of the activity ( 252+60 to 113+20 % for 40 mM D-ribose ; 258+95 to 139+ 52 % for 60 mM D-ribose ; Fig .
2 C and Table I ) .
In the absence of D-ribose , aminoguanidine seemed to have no direct effect on the insulin gene promoter as well as B-actin gene and RSV-LTR promoter activities ( Fig .
2 and Table I ) .
These neutralizing effects of aminoguanidine suggested that the two contras-tive effects of D-ribose , its suppressive effects on the insulin gene promoter and its activating effects on the RSV-LTR promoter , were both mediated by induction of glycation .
Glycation often causes an increase of ROS , which are suggested to play a primary role in glycation-induced tissue damage ( 18 , 33 ) .
Also , the RSV-LTR promoter , which was activated by D-ribose in a glycation-dependent manner ( Figs .
1 and 2 and Table I ) , is known to be a target of ROS-induced activation through the cis-acting motif CArG box ( 34 , 35 ) .
These findings tempted us to consider that ROS induction may also be involved in the D-ribose-induced , glycation-dependent changes in the promoter activities .
Accordingly , we inhibited H , O , production using 10 mM NAC and examined the effects on the changes in the promoter activities .
Similar to the results obtained with aminoguanidine , addition of NAC totally or partially rescued the cells from glycation-dependent reduction of the insulin gene promoter activity ( 48+19 to 104+10 % for 40 mM D-ribose ; 18+6 to 63+23 % for 60 mM D-ribose ; Fig .
3 A and Table I ) .
In terms of the RSV-LTR promoter , the D-ribose-induced promoter activation was totally abolished ( 252+60 to 100+19 % for 40 mM D-ribose ; to 101+*20 % for 60 mM D-ribose ; Fig .
3 C and Table I ) .
These results indicated that ROS induction mediates the glycation-dependent suppression of the insulin gene promoter as well as the activation of the RSV-LTR promoter .

Effects of D-ribose on the amounts of insulin gene tran-scripts .
Northern blot analyses were performed using a mouse insulin II cDNA ( 31 ) .
Each lane contained 10 pg total RNA isolated from HIT-T15 cells grown for 5 d under various conditions .
Blot A , cells were kept in medium containing 0 mM ( vehicle only ) , 40 mM , or 60 mM D-ribose ( lanes 7-3 ) .
Blot B , the culture medium contained 0 mM ( vehicle only ; lanes 4 , 8 , and 9 ) or 40 mM ( lanes 5-7 ) D-ribose along with 10 mM NAC ( lanes 6 and 8 ) or 1 mM aminoguanidine ( lanes 7 and 9 ) .
In lanes where aminoguanidine or NAC was not added , their vehicles were added instead .
The exposure time was 24 h for both blots .
Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments .
Glycation-dependent reduction of insulin mRNA amount and insulin content .
To examine whether the glycation-dependent suppression of the insulin gene promoter caused the reduction of its transcripts , insulin mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analyses ( Fig .
4 ) .
Amounts of insulin mRNA , detected as 0.5-kb bands on the blots , decreased when the HIT-T15 cells were kept for 5 d with 40 mM D-ribose ( Fig .
4 , lane 2 ) .
Further decrease was observed when they were kept with 60 mM D-ribose ( Fig .
4 , lane 3 ) .
Also in agreement with the observations on promoter activities , 1 mM aminoguanidine and 10 mM NAC neutralized the suppressive effects of D-ribose ( Fig .
4 , lanes 4-9 ) .
We also checked for possible changes in insulin content .
In agreement with the decrease in insulin mRNA , the insulin content of cells cultured in the presence of 40 mM D-ribose for 5 d was 41+6 pmol/mg protein ( average+SD ; n = 5 ) , which was only 18 % of that of the control cells kept for the same period without D-ribose ( 229+52 pmol/mg protein ; n = 5 ) .
Thus , the glycation-dependent suppression of the insulin gene promoter seemed to have reduced the amount of its transcript and protein in the cells .
Glycation-dependent reduction of DNA-binding activity of PDX-1 .
To obtain clues to understanding the molecular basis of the suppression of insulin gene promoter activity , we examined the possible glycation-induced changes in the activity of a transcription factor of the insulin gene , PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1 .
Using the human A3 region as a binding probe , gel mobility shift analyses were performed .
Before evaluating the effects of glycation , the specificity of the binding to the probe was verified using an anti-PDX-1 ( IPF1 ) antiserum ( 30 ) , wild and mutated competitors , and the hUPE3 competitor reproducing the hUPE3 site of the human glucokinase gene promoter , which we recently showed can bind PDX-1 ( Fig .
5 C and reference 30 ) .
The supershift of the band ( lane 2 ) , as well as specific competition by the competitors ( lanes 4-6 ) , demonstrated that PDX-1 in HIT cells specifically binds to the human A3 probe .
The effects of glycation on the DNA-binding activity of PDX-1 were evaluated in Fig .
5 , A and B .
When cells were kept for 5 d with 40 or 60 mM D-ribose , marked reduction of PDX-1 binding to the A3 probe was observed ( Fig .
5 A ) .
How-ever , coexistence of 1 mM aminoguanidine or 10 mM NAC in the media prevented the effects of D-ribose ( Fig .
5 B , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
In the absence of D-ribose , aminoguanidine or NAC alone had no effect on the PDX-1 activity .
These results indicated that D-ribose suppressed the DNA-binding activity of PDX-1 in a manner dependent on glycation and ROS .
Reversibility of the effects of D-ribose .
To investigate whether the D-ribose effects on the insulin gene transcription in HIT-T15 cells are reversible or not , we kept the cells under 40 mM D-ribose for 5 d and then started culturing the cells in media containing no D-ribose .
Total RNA and nuclear extracts were prepared from those cells at 2 d and 5 d after D-ribose was eliminated , and Northern blot analyses and gel mobility shift analyses were performed .
As shown in Fig .
6 , there was only slight recovery from the decrease in the insulin mRNA amounts caused by 40 mM D-ribose , even after the cells were kept in D-ribose-free medium for 5 d. Similarly , 5-d culture in D-ribose-free medium did not lead to recovery of the normal DNA-binding activity for PDX-1 ( Fig .
7 ) .
These observations suggest that the changes that occurred in the HIT-T15 cells because of the D-ribose-induced glycation and ROS are almost , if not totally , irreversible .
Discussion Under hyperglycemia , the production of various reducing sugars such as glucose , glucose-6-phosphate , and fructose increases through glycolysis and the polyol pathway .
All of these reducing sugars are known to promote glycation reactions of various proteins ( 19 , 36 ) .
In line with these facts , an increase in AGE was detected in various tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats ( 16 ) .
The pancreatic B cells , which express the high K , , glucose transporter GLUT2 abundantly and thereby display highly efficient glucose uptake when exposed to high glucose concentration , were recently shown to contain AGE ( 37 ) , providing support for the idea that glycation reaction may underlie the glucose toxicity to B cells .
In the present study , we established an in vitro model cell system that allows us to evaluate the potential effects of glycation and the consequent increase of ROS on the B cell function .
Among reducing sugars that potentially induce glycation , D-ribose is outstanding for its very potent activity and thus is often used in in vitro studies as an inducer of glycation ( 19 , 20 ) .
The use of D-ribose in this study could induce glycation in HIT-T15 cells during a relatively short period ( < 72 h ) between the transfection of the reporter gene plasmids and harvest of the cellular extracts .
This made it possible to show that glycation , at least when induced in HIT-T15 cells , suppresses the insulin gene promoter ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
In agreement with this decrease in the promoter activity , we observed decreases in the insulin mRNA ( Fig .
4 ) and insulin content , supporting the idea that glycation and ROS-dependent suppression of the insulin gene promoter caused impairment of insulin synthesis in HIT-T15 cells .

Evaluation of reversibility of the reduced insulin mRNA caused by D-ribose .
Northern blot analyses were performed using mouse insulin II eDNA ( 31 ) as a probe .
Each lane contained 10 pg total RNA isolated from HIT-T15 cells grown for 5 , 7 , and 10 d under various conditions ; the cells were kept in medium containing 0 mM ( vehicle only , lane 7 ) or 40 mM D-ribose for 5 d ( lane 2 ) , or were kept for 5 d in 40 mM D-ribose and then under D-ribose-free conditions for 2 ( lane 3 ) or 5 d ( lane 4 ) .
The exposure time was 24 h. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments .
Use of NAC allowed us to show the involvement of ROS in glycation-dependent suppression of the insulin gene promoter .
Lines of evidence have suggested to date that ROS , which are known to be induced in vivo when reducing sugars or unsaturated lipids are increased , may cause oxidative stress and damage to proteins in diabetes ( 18 , 33 ) .
Although the ROS that caused suppression of the insulin gene promoter in our present study were artificially induced by D-ribose , ROS can be physi-ologically generated by reducing sugars or unsaturated lipids in vivo , and may cause similar phenomena in diabetes .
We should note that , as could be expected from the strong deoxidizing activity , D-ribose caused reduction in cell viability .
In proportion to the D-ribose concentration , the speed of cell growth decreases ; when cells were cultured for 72 h in 40 and 60 mM D-ribose , cell numbers increased 2.6- and 1.3-fold , re-spectively , which were smaller than the 3.3-fold increase observed when they were kept without D-ribose .
Microscopically , after the 72-h culture with D-ribose , there were some cells whose attachment to the plate appeared to be loose .
These effects of D-ribose were almost totally prevented by addition of 1 mM aminoguanidine or 10 mM NAC ( Matsuoka , T. , and Y. Kajimoto , unpublished observations ) .
Although the pathophysiological significance of these phenomena is not known , such inhibitory effects of glycation or ROS on cell growth or survival may explain in part the B cell glucose toxicity .
How-ever , we assume that the suppressive effect on the promoter activity , which was observed for the insulin gene but not for the B-actin gene , should be taken as an event that is distinguishable from the effects on cell viability .
The clear difference in the responses to D-ribose between the insulin gene and B-actin gene promoters suggested that the suppression of the promoter activity should be attributed to impairment of specific D-Ribose 0 40 _ 40 _ 40 0 0 ( mM ) U 1 probe ( 2 0 ) ( 5 0 ) only Competitor - = - = w M ( x100 ) gee $ # i + ; < w ig~ # 148 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Figure 7 .
Evaluation of reversibility of the reduced PDX-1 activity caused by D-ribose .
Gel mobility shift analyses were performed to evaluate the reversibility of the reduction in PDX-1 activity caused by D-ribose .
The binding probe for the human insulin gene A3 region was the same as in Fig .

Nuclear extracts were prepared from HIT-T15 cells grown for 5 , 7 , and 10 d under various conditions ; the cells were kept in medium containing 0 mM ( vehicle only , lane 2 ) or 40 mM D-ribose for 5 d ( lane 3 ) , or were kept for 5 d in 40 mM D-ribose and then under D-ribose-free conditions for 2 ( lane 4 ) or 5 d ( lane 5 ) .
The binding specificity was evaluated using the unlabeled wild-type ( W , lane 6 ) , and mutated type ( M , lane 7 ) competitors that are described in Fig .
5 .
Lane 7 was the lane in which no nuclear extract was used .
Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments .
transcription factors rather than to more generalized events , such as a decrease in general cell viability .
Indirect support of our present observations comes from the previous reports by Olson et al .
( 8 ) and Sharma et al .
( 9 ) , which suggested reduction of PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1 ( 25 , 26 ) activity as a cause of coreduction of the insulin gene promoter activity and mRNA amounts .
Their cell model for glucose toxicity was the HIT-T15 cell kept under high glucose concentration for a very long period ( > 25 passages ) .
Despite the differences in experimental design between their study and ours , we obtained four observations in agreement with respect to insulin gene transcription : suppression of the promoter , decreases in mRNA and in protein , and impairment of PDX-1 activity .
The use of aminoguanidine and NAC in their experimental model may provide useful information for understanding the relative physiological significance of glycation or ROS in B cell glucose toxicity .
Another similarity between their data and ours was the irreversibility of the phenomena ( 38 ) ; the D-ribose Glycation Suppresses Insulin Gene Promoter Activity 149 dependent suppression of insulin mRNA as well as of the DNA-binding activity of PDX-1 was hardly recovered , even after the cells had been kept for 5 d without D-ribose ( Figs .
6 and 7 ) .
Thus it is likely that the suppressive effects of glycation or ROS on the insulin gene transcription , if they keep occurring in vivo , would accumulate in the cells and inhibit insulin synthesis .
Although physiological significance is most evident for PDX-1 whose disruption caused loss of the pancreas in mice ( 39 ) , several other factors , including RIPE3b1 , whose activity also seemed to be inhibited after chronic exposure of HIT cells to high glucose concentrations ( 8 , 9 ) , are also involved in regulation of the insulin gene .
Accordingly , to clarify all of the aspects of glycation or ROS effects on the insulin gene control machinery , the physiological roles of each transcription factor in determining the transcription rate of insulin gene need to be characterized .
In summary , we showed that glycation and the consequent increase of ROS are potential inhibitors of insulin gene transcription .
While increased glycation in various tissues was identified in diabetes in model animals ( 16 ) and in humans ( 15 , 40 ) , similar phenomena are likely to occur in vivo in islets .
The glycation-introduced HIT-T15 cells used in this study may offer a useful model for further understanding the molecular basis of glucose toxicity to pancreatic B cells .
