There is little direct evidence regarding the role of alveolar macrophages in these activation events .
In the present studies , rat lungs were depleted of alveolar macrophages by airway instillation of liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene diphosphonate .
These procedures , which greatly reduced the number of retrievable alveolar macrophages , suppressed activation of lung NF-KB in the inflammatory model .
In addition , bronchoalveolar lavage levels of tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF- « @ ) and the CXC chemokine , macrophage inflammatory protein-2 , were substantially reduced .
In parallel , upregulation of the lung vascular adhesion molecule , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , was greatly reduced by intrapulmonary instillation of phosphonate-containing liposomes .
Neutrophil accumulation and development of Tung injury were also substantially diminished .
Lung instillation of TNF-a in alveolar macrophage-depleted rats restored the NF-KB activation response in whole lung .
These data suggest that , in this inflammatory model , initial activation of NF-KB occurs in alveolar macrophages and the ensuing production of TNF-a may propagate NF- « B activation to other cell types in the lung .

The lung inflammatory response is regulated by coordinated functions of cytokines , chemokines , and adhesion molecules .
Acute lung injury induced by intrapulmonary deposition of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) immune complexes ( IgG-ICs ) in rats has allowed delineation of a variety of mediators in the inflammatory process .
In this model , production of tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF- « ) and interleukin ( IL ) -1B is required for upregulation of vascular adhesion molecules , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICA and E-selectin , on pulmonary vascular endothelial cells ( 1 , 2 ) .

692-698 , 1999 Internet address : www.atsjournals.org neutrophil chemotaxins ( i.e. , CXC chemokines and complement activation products ) , mediate the recruitment of neutrophils into the alveolar space ( 3-5 ) .
Immunostaining techniques have suggested that alveolar macrophages are the primary source of these cytokines and chemokines ( 4 , 6 ) .
In this inflammatory model , damage to lung parenchyma results from the generation and release of oxidants and pro-teases from recruited neutrophils and activated residential macrophages ( 7 , 8 ) .
Using the IgG-IC model of lung injury , we have recently demonstrated that the transcription factor nuclear factor ( NF ) - « kB is an important signal transduction element in the development of the lung inflammatory response ( 9 ) .
NF- « B consists of a heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits , which in most cells is retained in the cytoplasm in complex with inhibitory proteins of the IB family ( 10 ) .
Upon cell stimulation , IxB is degraded in a process requiring the function of the 268 proteasome .
The free `` activated '' heterodimeric NF-KB then translocates to the nucleus , where it binds to specific promoter elements and induces gene transcription .
NF-kB is known to regulate gene transcription of many cytokines ( i.e. , TNF-a , IL-1B ) , CXC chemokines ( of the IL-8 family ) , and endothelial adhesion molecules ( ICA M-1 , E-selectin ) involved in acute lung inflammation ( 11-14 ) .
We have recently shown Lentsch , Czermak , Bless , et al .
: Alveolar Macrophages and Lung NF- « B Activation 693 in vivo that nuclear translocation of NF- « B occurs in alveolar macrophages long before any evidence of lung inflammation ( 9 ) , suggesting that NF- « B activation in these cells triggers pulmonary production of the early proinflammatory mediators .
Depletion of alveolar macrophages by intratracheal instillation of liposomes containing the compound dichloromethylene diphosphonate ( CI , MDP ) has been used to study alveolar macrophage functions in vivo ( 15 , 16 ) .
The liposome-encapsulated CI MDP is ingested only by phago-cytic cells and results in selective depletion of alveolar macrophages without damaging other cell types in the lung ( 17 ) .
Using this technique , it has been shown that depletion of alveolar macrophages reduces lung production of TNF- « and neutrophil recruitment in a model of lipopolysaccha-ride-induced lung inflammation ( 15 ) .
Unexpectedly , in a model of bacterial pneumonia , depletion of alveolar macrophages by CI , MDP liposomes caused increased lung production of TNF- « and increased lung neutrophil recruitment ( 16 ) .
Thus , although the nature of the stimulus may dictate the function of alveolar macrophages , the latter studies suggest that under special circumstances there may be non-alveolar macrophage sources of TNF-a that may be relevant during the development of lung inflammatory injury .
Although nuclear translocation of NF- « B in alveolar macrophages is known to occur early in lung inflammation ( 9 ) , it is unclear whether the products of alveolar macrophages are required for NF-KB activation in other lung cells .
In the current studies , we sought to delineate further the role of alveolar macrophages in lung NF-KB activation and inflammatory injury induced by IgG-ICs .
The data to be presented indicate that depletion of alveolar macrophages with CI , MDP-liposomes suppresses NF- « B activation in lung tissues in this inflammatory model .
These effects were accompanied by reduced pulmonary production of TNF- « and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 ( MIP-2 ) , diminished recruitment of neutrophils , and protection against lung injury .
Furthermore , lung instillation of TNF-a « in alveolar macrophage-depleted rats restored NF- « B activation in whole-lung tissues .
These data suggest that NF-KB activation triggered by intrapulmonary deposition of IgG -ICs is initiated by products of alveolar macrophages .
In this model , NF- « B activation may then be propagated to other lung cells by products of activated alveolar macrophages such as cytokines and chemokines .
Materials and Methods Materials Liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol and containing either phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 7.4 or CL MDP ( a gift from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) were synthesized as described previously ( 17 ) .
Rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) was purchased from ICN Biomedi-cals , Inc. ( Costa Mesa , CA ) .
Rabbit polyclonal IgG antirat-ICAM-1 and nonspecific rabbit IgG were obtained from Accurate Chemical Company ( Westbury , NY ) .
Recombi-nant murine TNF- « was purchased from R & D Systems , Inc. ( Minneapolis , MN ) .
Alveolar Macrophage Depletion Specific pathogen-free male Long-Evans rats ( 275 to 300 g ; Harlan Sprague-Dawley , Indianapolis , IN ) were anesthetized with ketamine HCI ( 150 mg/kg , intraperitoneally ) .
A suspension of CI , MDP -liposomes in PBS ( 100 pl of liposomes in a total volume of 500 pl ) was administered intratracheally during inspiration .
A s a control , PBS-liposomes were administered in a similar fashion .
All subsequent interventions occurred 24 h after liposome instillation .
IgG-IC-Induced Alveolitis A total of 1.5 mg rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-BSA in a volume of 0.3 ml PBS was instilled via an intratracheal catheter during inspiration .
Immediately thereafter , 10 mg BSA in 0.5 ml PBS were injected intravenously .
For analysis of pulmonary vascular permeability , trace amounts of ' '' I-labeled BSA were injected intravenously .
Control rats received PBS intratracheally .
At 4 h after IgG-IC deposition , rats were exsanguinated , the pulmonary circulation was flushed with 10 ml saline by pulmonary artery injec-tion , and the lungs were surgically dissected .
For analysis of NF-kB activation and lung myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) content , lungs were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen .
The extent of lung injury was quantified by calculating the lung permeability index ( amount of radioactivity [ '*I-labeled BSA ] in the perfused lungs divided by the amount of radioactivity in 1.0 ml of blood obtained at the time of death ) .
Lung NF- « B Activation Nuclear extracts of whole-lung tissues were prepared by the method of Deryckere and Gannon ( 18 ) and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
Briefly , double-stranded NF- « B consensus oligonucleotide ( 5'-GTG AGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3 ' ; Promega , Madison , WI ) was end-labeled with triphosphate ( 3,000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml ; Amersham Co. , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Binding reactions containing equal amounts of nuclear protein extract ( 10 pg ) and 35 fmol ( ~ 50,000 cpm , Cherenkov counting ) of oligonucleotide were performed for 30 min in binding buffer ( 4 % glycerol , 1 mM MgC ] , 0.5 mM ethylenediamenetetraacetic acid [ EDTA ] [ pH 8.0 ] , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris [ pH 7.6 ] , and 50 pg/ml poly [ dI-dCJ ; Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Reaction volumes were held constant to 15 wl .
Reaction products were separated in a 4 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 % X TBE buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 8.0 ] and 1 mM EDTA ) and analyzed by autoradiography .
NF-KB activation was quantitated from digitized autoradiography films using image analysis software ( Adobe Systems , Inc. , San Jose , CA ) .
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid ( BALF ) Cytokine Content BALF was collected by instilling and withdrawing 5 ml of sterile PBS three times from the lungs via an intratracheal cannula .
BALF content of TNF- « was measured using a standard WEHI cell cytotoxicity assay as previously reported ( 19 ) .
Measurement of MIP-2 in BALF was by en-zyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) as described elsewhere ( 4 ) .

20 1999 Lung Vascular Expression of ICAM-1 Rats were injected intravenously with 0.5 wCi of '*I-labeled anti-ICAM-1 3.75 h after induction of lung injury .
To control for nonspecific binding and potential accumulation of anti-ICAM-1 antibody in lung parenchyma due to injury , 0.5 Ci `` I-labeled nonspecific rabbit IgG was administered in a separate set of rats .
Fifteen minutes later ( 4 h after induction of lung injury ) , rats were killed and the lung vascu-lature was flushed with 10 ml PBS .
Lung vascular ICA M-1 expression ( binding index ) was calculated by dividing the amount of radioactivity ( `` *I-labeled antibody ) in perfused lungs by the amount of radioactivity in 1.0 ml of blood obtained at the time of death .
Lung MPO Content Whole-lung MPO activity was quantitated as described previously ( 20 ) .
Briefly , whole-lung homogenates were diluted in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 % hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide , pH 6.0 .
After sonication and two freeze-thaw cycles , samples were centrifuged at 4,000 X g for 30 min .
The supernatants were reacted with H , O ; ( 0.3 mM ) in the presence of tetrameth-ylbenzidine ( 1.6 mM ) .
MPO activity was assessed by measuring the change in absorbance at 655 nm .
Statistical Analysis All values are expressed as means + SEM .
Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance , and individual group means were then compared with a Student-New-man-Keuls test .
Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05 .
For calculations of percent change , negative control values were subtracted from positive control and treatment group values .
Results Depletion of Alveolar Macrophages with CI , MDP-Liposomes To determine the role of alveolar macrophages in the development of IgG lung inflammatory injury , experiments were initiated to deplete lungs of alveolar macrophages by intratracheal administration of CI , liposomes .
Instillation of 100 pl CI , MDP-liposomes in a total volume of 1 ml has been shown to result in greater than 70 % depletion of alveolar macrophages within 24 h ( 15 ) .
In our studies , lung instillation of 1 ml of the liposome suspension was not tolerated .
Therefore , we tested the effects of lower dose-volumes containing 100 pl of liposomes .
Rats received CI , MDP -liposomes ( 100 wl ) in total volumes of either 300 or 500 pl PBS .
Twenty-four hours later the number of alveolar macrophages was assessed by BAL .
Administration of CIL , MDP -liposomes in a total volume of 300 pl produced approximately 53 % depletion of alveolar macrophages ( data not shown ) .
When the dose volume was increased to 500 pl , CI , MDP-liposomes decreased the number of alveolar macrophages obtained by BAL by 74 % ( P < 0.001 ) when compared with rats receiving PBS-liposomes ( Figure 1 ) .
Administration of PBS-liposomes did not reduce the number of alveolar macrophages compared with pretreatment with 500 pl PBS alone .
For all subsequent experiments in which alveo- lar macrophage depletion was carried out , a dose of 100 pl CI , MDP -liposomes in a total volume of 500 pl PBS was used .
Effects of Alveolar Macrophage Depletion on IgG-IC-Induced Activation of NF- < B in Lung Our recent studies in the IgG -IC model of lung injury have suggested that lung NF-kB activation is prerequisite for the development of lung injury ( 9 ) .
Because these studies demonstrated that NF- « B activation in alveolar macrophages in vivo occurs hours before NF- « B activation in whole-lung tissues , we examined whether alveolar macrophage depletion could alter activation in whole-lung tissues .
Nuclear extracts of whole lungs obtained 4 h after onset of injury were analyzed by EMSA .
Lungs from rats pretreated with PBS- or CI , MDP -liposomes and subsequently challenged intratracheally with PBS displayed normal baseline levels of NF-KB activation ( Figure 2A ) .
In rats pretreated with PBS-liposomes and challenged with IgG the expected increase in lung NF-KB activation was found .
Depletion of alveolar macrophages with CI , MDP -liposomes markedly reduced the extent of lung NF-kB activation induced by intrapulmonary deposition of IgG-ICs .
When EMSA blots were subjected to image analysis ( Figure 2B ) , alveolar macrophage depletion was found to reduce IgG lung NF-KB activation by 74 % ( P = 0.031 ) .

The EMSA blots were digitized and quantitated using image analysis software ( B ) .
Values represent means * SEM with n = 4 per group .
that we have shown alveolar macrophage depletion to greatly reduce lung NF- « B activation ( Figure 2 ) , we examined the effects of alveolar macrophage depletion on BALF levels of TNF-a and MIP-2 proteins .
Using a WEHI cell cytotoxicity assay for TNF- « , we observed very low levels of TNF-a in BALF from rats pretreated with PBS- or CLMDP-liposomes and then challenged intratracheally with PBS ( Figure 3A ) .
Intrapulmonary deposition of IgG -ICs caused a dramatic increase in BALF TNF-a levels in rats treated with PBS-liposomes .
However , depletion of alveolar macrophages with CI , MDP liposomes caused a 48 % reduction ( P = 0.006 ) in BALF TNF- « content .
Similar effects were observed when MIP-2 was measured by ELISA .
There were low levels of MIP in BALF from rats that had been pretreated with PBS- or CI , MDP liposomes and subsequently challenged with PBS ( Figure 3B ) .
In response to IgG-IC deposition , MIP-2 levels were greatly increased ( > 5-fold ) in BALF from rats pretreated with PBS-liposomes .
In contrast , in rats depleted of alveolar macrophages by pretreatment with CI , MDP-liposomes , IgG-IC-induced increases in BALF MIP-2 were reduced by 78 % ( P = 0.004 ) .
Upregulation of pulmonary vascular ICAM-1 has been shown to be required for lung neutrophil accumulation and full development of tissue injury in this model ( 3 ) .
Because products of activated alveolar macrophages ( includ-ing TNF- « ) are known to be related to ICAM-1 expression ( 1 ) , we determined the effects of alveolar macrophage depletion on lung vascular expression of ICAM-1 using `` I-labeled antibody to ICAM-l. Pretreatment of rats with either PBS- or CI , MDP -liposomes had no effect on baseline levels of ICAM-1 expression after intratracheal challenge with PBS ( Figure 3C ) .
In rats pretreated with PBS-liposomes and challenged with IgG -ICs , lung vascular ICAM-1 expression showed the expected increase ( nearly 3-fold ) .
This increase was not due to nonspecific binding or sequestration of antibody because binding indexes for nonspecific rabbit IgG were not different between PBS-challenged and IgG-IC-challenged rats ( 0.17 + 0.05 and 0.20 + 0.07 , respectively ) .
In contrast , in the rats depleted of alveolar macrophages with CIL , MDP liposomes , IgG -IC-induced ICAM-1 expression was reduced by 67 % ( P = 0.035 ) ( Figure 3C ) .
As will be shown subsequently , this correlates with reduced accumulation of neutrophils in the inflamed lung .
Effects of Alveolar Macrophage Depletion on Neutrophil Recruitment and Development of Lung Injury Because depletion of alveolar macrophages suppressed IgG -IC-induced increases in lung NF- « B activation ( Figure 2 ) , BALF content of TNF- « and MIP-2 ( Figures 3A and 3B ) , and lung vascular expression of ICA ( Figure 3C ) , we examined the extent to which these effects were associated with reduced neutrophil recruitment into lung and development of lung injury .
Neutrophil recruitment into lung was quantitated by lung content of MPO activity .
In rats pretreated with PBS- or CI , MDP-liposomes and challenged with PBS , there was no evidence of neutrophil accumulation in lung ( Figure 4A ) .
In rats pretreated with PBS-liposomes and then challenged with IgG-ICs , lung MPO content was , as expected , significantly increased from rats pretreated with PBS-liposomes and challenged with PBS .
As shown in Figure 4A , depletion of alveolar macrophages with CI , MDP liposomes decreased IgG -IC-induced MPO values by 59 % ( P = 0.002 ) .
Lung injury was quantitated by changes in vascular permeability as measured by leakage of ' '' I-albumin into lung parenchyma .
As shown in Figure 4B , there was no evidence of lung injury in rats challenged with PBS after pretreatment with either PBS- or CI , MDP -liposomes .
As expected , intrapulmonary deposition of IgG-ICs caused significant lung injury in rats pretreated with PBS-liposomes , with a 5.5-fold increase in the permeability index .
Rats depleted of alveolar macrophages with CI , MDP -liposomes incurred significantly less lung injury ( 55 % reduction , P = 0.015 ) compared with positive control rats pretreated with PBS-liposomes .

TNF-a Restores NF- « B Activation in Lung Because depletion of alveolar macrophages suppressed lung production of TNF- « and reduced lung NF-KB activation , experiments were designed to determine whether ex-ogenous administration of TNF-a would lead to NF-kB activation in lung of macrophage-depleted rats .
Alveolar macrophage-depleted rats received lung instillation of PBS or 500 ng of murine TNF-a , and lung NF-KB activation was assessed by EMSA 4 h later .
In macrophage-depleted rats , lung instillation of PBS did not cause nuclear translocation of NF-kB ( Figure 5 ) .
However , lung instillation of TNF-a resulted in a marked increase in nuclear NF-KB .
These data suggest that products of activated alveolar macrophages , such as TNF- « , may be responsible for NF-KB activation in the inflamed lung .

Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of CI , MDP-liposomes , rats received lung instillations of PBS or 500 ng murine TNF-a in a total volume of 300 pl .
Four hours later , lung NF-KB activation was assessed by EMSA .
E T Alveolar Macrophage-Depleted Lungs Discussion Increasing evidence suggests an important role for NF-KB in the pathogenesis of acute lung inflammation .
Studies in vitro have shown that regulates gene expression of cytokines ( TNF- « , IL-1B ) , chemokines ( MIP-2 , CINC ) , and adhesion molecules ( ICA M-1 , E-selectin ) , which play important roles in lung inflammatory injury ( 11-14 ) .
These in vitro findings are supported by studies in humans with acute respiratory distress syndrome showing enhanced NF-xB activation in alveolar macrophages recovered by BAL ( 21 ) .
In addition , studies in vivo have shown an association between NF- « B activation and expression of cytokines , chemokines , and vascular adhesion molecules ( 22 ) .
More recent studies in vivo have demonstrated that lung NF-KB activation is suppressed by antioxidants ( 23 ) or anti-inflammatory cytokines ( 9 ) .
This results in decreased proinflammatory mediator expression and reduced inflammatory injury .
Thus , it appears that activation of may be central to the development of pulmonary inflammation .
The mechanism of NF-kB activation during lung inflammatory injury is known to require both TNF-a and IL-1 , which seem to operate as autocrine/paracrine stimu-lators of alveolar macrophages ( 24 ) .
Alveolar macrophage activation is an initial event in the genesis of lung inflammatory reactions .
In the rat model of injury induced by intrapulmonary deposition of IgG-ICs , we have shown that early activation of alveolar macrophages occurs in an NF-B-dependent manner ( 9 ) .
Furthermore , NF-KB activation in alveolar macrophages in vivo occurs prior to NF-KB activation in whole-lung tissues , suggesting that products of activated alveolar macrophages are required to stimulate nuclear translocation of NF-kB in other lung-cell types .
The present data support that hypothesis because depletion of alveolar macrophages attenuated NF-KB activation in whole-lung tissues and decreased BALF content of proinflammatory mediators .
In addition , lung instillation of TNF-a in alveolar macrophage-depleted rats induced NF-xB activation in whole lungs .
Although alveolar macrophages are considered a major source of TNF-a in the lung , alveolar macrophage depletion reduced BAL TNF-a by only 48 % .
Similarly , IgG -IC-induced increases in pulmonary vascular permeability were decreased by 55 % in rats depleted of alveolar macrophages .
These data suggest the presence of other important sources of TNF- « in lung , such as interstitial macrophages and perhaps nonmacrophage cell types , that may cooperatively contribute to tissue injury .
A Iternatively , the small amount of alveolar macrophages remaining after CI , MDP liposome administration ( ~ 26 % ) may have produced a disproportionately large amount of TNF- « .
Treatment with CIL , MDP-liposomes , which on average resulted in a 74 % reduction in the number of lavageable alveolar macrophages , almost completely abrogated BALF content of the chemokine MIP-2 ( 78 % reduction ) .
These data confirm our earlier report suggesting that activated alveolar macrophages are the primary source of MIP-2 ( 4 ) .
Damage to lung tissues after IgG -IC deposition is mediated primarily by neutrophil-derived oxidants and pro-teases ( 7 , 8 , 25 ) .
In rats depleted of alveolar macrophages , pulmonary neutrophil accumulation was greatly reduced , as was the extent of lung injury .
Neutrophil recruitment into lung induced by IgG -IC deposition is known to depend on vascular expression of ICA M-1 and production of CXC chemokines , which include MIP-2 and CINC ( 3 , 4 ) .
Alveolar macrophage depletion by CIL , MDP significantly reduced both MIP-2 content in BALF and pulmonary vascular expression of ICAM-1 .
Decreased levels of MIP -2 can be ascribed to the physical removal of its cellular source , alveolar macrophages .
Decreased expression of ICAM-1 is likely due to decreased availability of TNF-a , which is known to regulate ICA M-1 expression ( 1 ) .
Depletion of alveolar macrophages reduced IgG -IC-induced lung NF-kB activation and TNF-a production in a manner similar to treatment with the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 .
Both IL-10 and IL-13 suppress alveolar macrophage function by preserving cytosolic expression of the inhibitory protein IxBa , thus preventing nuclear localization of NF- « B ( 9 ) .
At least in the case of IL-10 , suppression of NF-KB activation in macrophages in vitro is known to prevent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines ( 26 , 27 ) .
In IgG-IC-induced lung inflammation , administration of IL-10 or IL-13 greatly suppressed lung production of TNF- « and subsequent lung injury ( 28 ) .
Thus , it appears in vivo that IL-10 and IL-13 suppress alveolar macrophage NF-KB activation , preventing proinflammatory cytokine production and reducing lung inflammation and injury .
The findings of those studies , combined with the data presented in this report , suggest that specific inhibitors of NF-KB ( i.e. , proteasome inhibitors , IxBa ki-nase inhibitors , etc . )
may be targeted for delivery to alveolar macrophages by liposome encapsulation .
This could represent a potent therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute lung inflammation in which products of lung macrophages play a major role in events leading to lung injury .
