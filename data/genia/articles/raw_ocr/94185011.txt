M. ] ABSTRACT CD38 is a leukocyte differentiation antigen that has been thought to be a phenotypic marker of different subpopulations of T-and B-lymphocytes .
In myeloid cells , CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation .
Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38 .
Recently we reported that all-frans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells .
Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid- receptor ( RARa ) .
ATRA failed to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line ( designated HL-60R ) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation .
Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor ( RARa ) into this HL-6OR subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38 .
In contrast , CD38 expression was not inducible by ATRA in HL-6OR cells , transfected with a functional RARB , RAR+y , or RXRa receptor .
Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation .
Following culture with ATRA , increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34* bone marrow cells , but not on normal circulating granulocytes .
From these results , we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34* bone marrow cells .
This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RARa in HL-60 cells , suggesting a similar role for RARa in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells .
INTRODUCTION One of the earliest characterized but perhaps least studied lymphocyte differentiation antigens is the CD38 , a membrane glycoprotein of M , 46,000 .
CD38 has a rather unique pattern of expression and is expressed during early or late , but not intermediate , stages of T- and B-cell differentiation ( 1-6 ) .
Within the myeloid lineage , CD38 is mainly expressed by precursor cells , and only weak expression has been observed on mature myeloid cells ( 7 , 8 ) .
Its expression has also been reported on the malignant counterparts of these hematopoietic cells , and CD38 may be of prognostic relevance in acute myelogenous leukemia ( 9 ) .
However , virtually no information is available on the regulation and function of CD38 in myeloid leukemia cells .
The retinoids ( natural and synthetic analogues of vitamin A ) , particularly retinoic acid , have been shown to exert a wide range of biological effects .
For example , it has been reported to be a possible morphogen in the embryonic tissues of frogs and chickens , an effective agent in the treatment of certain dermatological disorders , an immunomodulator , and an important regulator of the cell growth and Received 8/17/93 ; accepted 1/28/94 .

ATRA is a powerful inducer of differentiation in APL cells ( 15 ) .
When administered as a single agent , ATRA induces complete clinical remissions in a majority of patients with APL ( 16-18 ) .
These and other biological effects of retinoids are thought to be primarily mediated through specific receptors that are members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of nuclear transcription factors .
To date , several human retinoic receptors have been identified , including RARa , which is widely expressed in different hematopoietic cells ( 19 ) ; RAR $ , which is expressed in a variety of epithelial cells ( 20 ) ; and RARy , which is predominantly expressed in the skin tissue ( 21 ) .
RXRa is another retinoic acid receptor that has been identified and has been shown to differ from RARs in primary sequence and in its pharmacological response to retinoids ( 22 ) .
Interaction of retinoid with a specific receptor permits binding of the receptor to specific cis-acting DNA sequences which , in turn , induces or suppresses the transcription of certain target genes .
Since different isoforms of retinoic acid receptor exhibit distinct patterns of tissue-specific expression , they might mediate distinct biological activities .
However , to date there have been very few , if any , studies to determine the precise relationship between RAR expression and response to retinoids .
In this study , we used a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line ( HL-60 ) as a model for investigating the receptor-specific action of the retinoids , because these cells undergo granulocytic differentiation following ATRA treatment ( 15 ) .
Recently , ATRA was shown to be a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 antigen in these cells ( 23 , 24 ) .
In this paper , we demonstrate that the mutant subclone of this cell line ( HL-6OR ) , which is relatively resistant to ATRA ( 25 ) , failed to express CD38 when treated with ATRA .
However , retrovirus-medi-ated transduction of the RARa gene into the HL-6OR subclone completely restored their sensitivity to ATRA .
ATRA induced a similar increase in CD38 expression in leukemic cells from APL and AML patients .
Normal CD34 * bone marrow cells also respond to ATRA in terms of CD38 expression , but normal granulocytes failed to show any induction in CD38 expression .

of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center .
In patients with APL , leukemic cells were characterized by promyelocytic morphology ( M3 by French-American-British criteria ) and the t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation .
Normal BM samples were obtained from bone marrow transplant donors ( generously provided by Dr. R. Champlin ) , and normal peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers .
Mononuclear cells and granulocytes were separated by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque ( densities 1.077 and 1.119 ; Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline .
Cell Culture .
In experiments where differentiating and activating agents were compared , HL-60 cells were cultured in the medium in the presence or absence of ATRA ( 100 nm ; Sigma ) , DMSO ( 1.3 % v/v ; Sigma ) , G-CSF ( 50 ng/ml ; Amgen , Thousand Oaks , CA ) , GM-CSF ( 200 units/ml ; generously provided by Dr. S. Gillis , Immunex , Seattle WA ) , IFN-y ( 500 units/ml ; Genzyme , Boston , MA ) , or TPA ( 20 um ; Sigma ) for 24 h. In order to induce the granulocytic differentiation of cell lines and cells from APL and AML patients , cells were resuspended in the medium ( 5 X 10° cells/ml ) and incubated in the presence of 2 um ATRA for 6 days .
Granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells was also accomplished by incubation in the presence of 1.3 % ( v/v ) DMSO for 7 days .
Myeloid maturation was assessed by morphology ( Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospin preparations ) , immunopheno-typing ( CD11b expression ) , and by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test , as described previously ( 28 ) .
In all experiments with normal BM and PB cells , ATRA was used at a final concentration of 100 nm .
Immunofluorescence and Flow Cytometry .
Expression of CD38 protein was determined using monoclonal antibody Leu-17 ( PE-conjugated ; Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
One million cells were incubated with the antibody at a final concentration of 5 ug/ml for 30 min on ice , followed by 2 washes with phosphate-buffered saline .
Background fluorescence was determined using an isotypic control antibody ( PE-labeled IgG1 ; Becton Dickinson ) at the same concentration .
Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer using the LYSIS II Research Software ( Becton Dickinson ) .
PE fluorescence was detected on a logarithmic scale .
The percent of CD38-positive cells was determined as a percentage of cells expressing CD38 over the background isotypic control antibody .
Intensity of CD38 expression was shown as S/N ratios defined as the mean fluorescence of CD38-expressing cells divided by the mean fluorescence of cells stained with the isotypic control antibody .
CD38 expression on subsets of normal PB and BM cells was determined in 2-color flow cytometric experiments , where Leu-17 PE was used together with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled lineage specific antibodies ( Leu-4/CD3 , Leu-14/CD22 , Leu-M1/CD15 , Leu-M3/CD14 , HPCA-2/CD34 ; all from Becton Dickinson ) .
All antibodies were used at saturating concentrations according to the manufacturer 's recommendations and cells were incubated for 30 min on ice .
Appropriate isotypic controls were included to set the compensation on the FACScan .
CD38 expression on antigen-defined subpopulations was measured after setting a live-gate on cells positive for the lineage-specific antibody and collecting at least 5000 events .
Statistical Analysis .
Mean values of groups were analyzed using Student 's t test for paired samples .
RESULTS Expression of CD38 in Differentiated HL-60 and KG-1 Cells .
We first studied the expression of CD38 in HL-60 cells following their differentiation into mature granulocyte-like cells by culture in the presence of ATRA ( 2 um ) or DMSO ( 1.3 % , v/v ) for 6 days .
Most cells under these conditions exhibited the characteristics of differentiated myeloid cells by morphology , immunophenotypically , and their ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium ( Table 1 ) .
CD38 expression was significantly increased ( 15-18-fold ) in ATRA-treated HL-60 cells when compared with untreated controls ( Table 1 ; Fig .
14 ) .
However , the cells induced to differentiate by treatment with DMSO showed only a moderate ( 4-S5-fold ) increase in CD38 protein , even though a majority of the cells under these conditions had differentiated morphologically and immunophenotypically to granulocytic cells ( Table 1 ) .
Expression of CD38 protein was also studied under these conditions in KG-1 cells .
After 6 days of culture in the presence of ATRA ( 2 um ) , a majority of the cells had morphologically differentiated to mature myeloid cells ( metamyelocytes and neutrophils ) .
The morphological differentiation was associated with a parallel increase in CD33+*/CD11b* immunophenotype .

accumulated very high levels of CD38 ( 11-14-fold ) when compared with untreated and thus undifferentiated cells ( Table 1 ; Fig .
1B ) .
CD38 Expression in HL-60R Cells .
Next we determined the modulation of CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of HL-60 ( HL-60R ) that exhibited relative resistance to ATRA .
Resistance of HL-60R to ATRA was attributed to a point mutation in the RARa gene that results in the truncation of 52 amino acids at the -COOH terminal end of RARa protein ( 25 ) .
The truncated receptor has markedly reduced affinity for its ligand , ATRA .
HL-60R cells showed a high degree of resistance to ATRA in terms of their inability to express CD38 .
As shown in Fig .
2 , treatment of HL-6OR cells with as high as 5 um ATRA induced only a moderate degree of CD38 expression when compared with wild type HL-60 cells , treated under similar conditions .
At lower doses ( < 1 pum ) , HL-60R cells were completely resistant to ATRA-induced expression of CD38 .
Wild type HL-60 cells were highly responsive to ATRA ; the 50 % effective concentration for induction of CD38 antigen was approximately 1 pm ( 23 ) and showed a significant accumulation of CD38 protein after 24-h treatment with 0.1 um ATRA .
Interestingly , even the basal level of CD38 expression in untreated HL-60R cells was far lower ( S/N ratio , 1.5 + 0.74 ; mean + SD ) than the wild type untreated cells ( S/N ratio , 9.6 + 3.4 ; Fig .
2 ) .
Similarly , the K562 cells , a prototype human myeloid leukemia cell type that is resistant to ATRA-induced differentiation , failed to show any increase in CD38 expression following treatment with ATRA ( Fig .
2 ) .
Next we compared the CD38 expression in uninfected RA-resistant HL-6OR cells or HL-6O0R cells infected with LXSN retroviral vector , harboring a complementary DNA insert that contained a complete coding sequence of RARa , RARB , RARy , or RXRa ( 26 ) .
Interestingly , transfection of HL-6OR cells with functional RARa « completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA ( Fig .
3 ) .
Untreated RARa transfected HL-6OR cells did not exhibit an appreciable level of CD38 expression ( S/N ratio , 1.38 + 0.6 ; Fig .
44 ) .
However , 24-h culture in the presence of 100 nm ATRA induced a high expression of CD38 antigen in these cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
The level of ATRA-induced CD38 expression in RARa-transfected HL-6OR cells ( S/N ratio of 195.9 + 14.1 ) was even higher than that observed in ATRA-treated wild-type HL-60 cells ( S/N ratio of 109.0 + 24.6 ) .
We also tested HL-60R cell lines that were transfected with RARf3 , RAR y , or RXRa .
None of these sublines showed constitutive expression of CD38 , and treatment with 100 nm ATRA for 24 h induced very low levels of CD38 protein in RARB ( S/N ratio of 9.3 ) and RARy ( S/N ratio of 49.6 ) transfected HL-6OR cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similarly , no significant induction of CD38 protein was observed in HL-6OR cells transfected with RXRa ( S/N ratio 1.59 + 0.29 ; Fig .
4C ) .
Similarly , long term culture ( 6 days ) of transfected cell lines ( RARa , RAR , RARy , and RXRa ) in the presence of ATRA failed to alter CD38 expression appreciably ( data not shown ) .
However , as previously observed ( 26 ) , under these conditions ( 100 nm , 6 days ) a majority of the cells from all 4 transfected subclones underwent the morphological changes characteristic of granulocytic differentiation , suggesting the presence of functional receptors .
In order to ascertain whether ATRA is a specific inducer of CD38 expression , we tested several other differentiation-inducing agents and compared their ability to induce CD38 in HL-60R cells and their RARa or RXRa transfected subclones .
Results summarized in Table 2 revealed that induction of CD38 is a specific response of these cells towards ATRA .
Other differentiation agents such as DMSO , G-CSF , GM-CSF , IFN-y , and TPA did not alter the CD38 expression in either HL-6OR cells or its transfected subclones .
Several studies have reported that the ability of retinoids to induce differentiation in a variety of normal and malignant cell types can be greatly increased by the addition of agents that elevate intracellular cyclic AMP ( 15 , 29 , 30 ) .
We , therefore , tested the ability of dibutyryl HL-6OR-RARoc 6 3 god $ o d fo ll ® ( d Fig .

The level CD38 was determined by flow cytometry as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Results are from representative experiments from 3 independent observations .

Effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on ATRA-induced expression of CD38 .
The level of CD38 expression in untreated HL-60 cells ( Control ) and HL-60 cells treated for 24 h with either 1 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( dibutyry ] cyclic adenosine monophosphate ; DBC ) , 1 nm ATRA , or ATRA plus DBC was determined by flow cytometry as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
The values shown represent the mean and ranges of duplicate determinations .
The combination of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and ATRA was slightly more effective ( 26-fold ) than either agent alone in inducing the CD38 antigen expression .
Induction of CD38 by ATRA in APL and AML Cells .
To further investigate whether CD38 induction was associated with differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells , we studied CD38 expression in cells from APL and AML patients , following their in vitro culture in the presence or absence of ATRA .
Six-day culture of cells from 4 APL patients with 2 um ATRA led to prominent morphological changes in these cells that were characteristic of mature granulocytes ( Table 3 ) .
The CD38 expression in ATRA-treated APL cells was significantly higher ( S/N ratio , 20.8 + 14.2 ) when compared with untreated controls ( S/N ratio , 2.55 + 1.46 ) or with normal peripheral blood neutrophils ( S/N ratio 1.9 + 0.65 , determined in neutrophils isolated from 5 normal individuals ) .

( 2.5-5-fold ) was observed in cells from AML patients after their in vitro treatment with ATRA ( 2 um , 6 days ) .
However , unlike in APL cells , induction of CD38 antigen in AML cells by ATRA was not accompanied by any morphological or immunophenotypic changes ( Table 4 ) .
Effect of ATRA on CD38 Expression on Normal Hematopoietic Cells .
In order to determine whether ATRA can modulate CD38 expression in normal hematopoietic cells , we studied CD38 expression in normal BM and PB cells after 24 h of culture in the presence or absence of 100 nm ATRA ( Fig .
6 ) .
After ATRA treatment , analysis of the entire BM mononuclear cell population revealed neither an increase in CD38-positive cells nor an increase in CD38 protein levels .
However , CD38 expression in normal CD34+* positive BM cells , as determined by 2-color flow cytometry , was significantly higher after culture with ATRA compared to untreated controls ( P < 0.05 ; Fig .
6B ) .
In normal PB mononuclear cells , there was a slight increase in the percentage of CD38-positive cells , following their culture with ATRA .
Analysis of PB cell subpopulations indicated that this increase was due to a significantly increased proportion of CD38 expressing T-lymphocytes ( CD3 ) , whereas the percentages of CD38-positive B-lymphocytes ( CD22 ) and monocytes ( CD14 ) were un-changed .
Intensity of CD38 expression was not influenced by ATRA in normal T-lymphocytes and monocytes , but an increase in S/N ratios was observed in B-lymphocytes .
CD38 was not expressed on normal granulocytes ( CD15 ) , nor could it be induced by treatment with ATRA .
There was no appreciable change observed in S/N ratios of CD34 , CD3 , CD22 , CD14 , and CD15 in BM or PB cells that were treated with ATRA or left untreated in cultures for 24 h ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION We have been interested in understanding the mechanisms by which retinoids regulate cell growth and differentiation of normal and transformed hematopoietic cells .
Retinoids , and RA in particular , have been shown to influence the proliferation and differentiation functions in various cell types ( 10 , 11 ) .
These biological effects of RA are believed to be due to their ability to interact with specific nuclear receptors that in turn result in altered expression of certain genes in target cells .
However , there are not many proteins whose expression has been shown to be under the direct control of RA .
The CD38 antigen is a multilineage molecule ( 2-8 ) whose expression has been associated with an activated state of lymphocytes ( 3 , 4 ) .
In cells belonging to the myeloid lineage , CD38 is present mainly on precursor cells ( 7 , 8 ) .
There is no information available on the endogenous factors that modulate the expression of CD38 in myeloid or even in lymphoid cells .
Recently we have demonstrated that ATRA is a highly potent inducer of CD38 expression , both in vitro and in vivo , in human promyelocytic leukemia cells ( 23 ) .
As low a dose of ATRA as 100 fm is able to induce large increases in CD38 expression , and this increase is due to rapid accumulation of CD38 mRNA after addition of ATRA to the cultured cells .
More recently , a similar increase in CD38 expression by ATRA has been reported by Kontani et al .
( 24 ) .
These observations suggested to us that induction of this antigen could be a useful tool to study retinoid-mediated regulation of gene expression in normal and transformed myeloid cells .
In this study , we demonstrate that ATRA is a general inducer of CD38 antigen in normal and transformed myeloid cells and that RARa plays an important role in mediating this effect in HL-60 myeloid cells .
Furthermore , our results suggest that CD38 is not a part of the regular differentiation pathway of myeloid cells .
In normal myelopoiesis , CD38 is expressed by cells during early stages of myeloid differentiation ( 8 ) , and then it declines during myeloid maturation ( 7 ) .
Our results confirm the observation that normal mature granulocytes do not express CD38 .
Moreover , treatment of normal granulocytes with ATRA failed to augment CD38 expression that was in contrast to high CD38 expression observed in APL cells that were morphologically differentiated to mature granulocytes , following their in vitro treatment with ATRA .
Although RARs are thought to be the ultimate mediators of retinoid action for gene regulation , very little data are available to support this contention ; however , that biological activity of several retinoids correlates well with their affinity for RARs ( 31 ) is one piece of supportive evidence .
More direct evidence came from our earlier studies with HL-60 cells , where transduction of RARa via retroviral vector in RA-resistant cells was shown to restore the responsiveness of these cells to ATRA ( 26 , 32 ) .
In the present study , we have used a similar approach to determine participation of RARs in ATRA-induced up-regulation of CD38 expression .
Specific nuclear RARs in a RA-resistant subclone of HL-60 cells ( HL-6OR ) exhibit a decreased affinity for ATRA due to truncation of 52 amino acids at the COOH terminal end of RARa ( 25 ) .

Effects of ATRA on CD38 expression in normal bone marrow and peripheral blood cells .
The percentages of CD38 positive cells ( A ) and the level of CD38 expression ( B , shown as S/N ratios ) were determined in untreated cells ( open bars ) and cells treated with 100 nm ATRA ( solid bars ) for 24 h. PB , PB mononuclear cells ; BM , BM mononuclear cells .
Two-color flow cytometry was used to study CD38 expression on antigen-defined subpopulations .
Following treatment with ATRA , the percentage of CD38-expressing T-cells ( CD3 ) had increased significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .
A significant increase ( P < 0.05 ) in CD38 protein level was also observed in ATRA-treated normal CD34 * bone marrow cells as well as in CD22* peripheral blood B-lymphocytes .
No expression of CD38 in untreated cells or induction following their treatment with ATRA was observed in normal granulocytes ( CD15 ) .
Results are from 3 normal bone marrow samples and 4 normal peripheral blood samples ( mean * SD ) .
CD15 ATRA under optimal conditions ( 1 um , 24 h ) , failed to show any appreciable increase in CD38 expression in these cells .
Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of the single copy of the RARa into this RA-resistant HL-60 subclone completely restored the ability of these cells to induce CD38 in response to ATRA .
In contrast , CD38 was very weakly induced in the HL-6OR cells that were transfected with RARBG or RARy , and no up-regulation of CD38 was seen in the RXRa transfected cells .
Each of these transduced cell lines express relatively high levels of their transduced receptors ( 300 to 2000 receptors/cell ) compared to the untreated HL-6OR cells ( 125 receptors/cell ) ( 25 ) .
Moreover , K562 , a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line , was completely unresponsive to ATRA-induced effects on CD38 .
This unresponsiveness of K562 cells might be attributed to the presence of a very low level ( 80 receptors/cell ) of RARa compared with 550 receptors/cell in HL-60 cells , which respond to ATRA ( 33 ) .
The presence of RARs may or may not be sufficient to render a cell responsive to the growth inhibitory or differentiation-inducing effects of retinoids .
However , we feel that presence of functional RARa in myeloid cells is sufficient to make these cells responsive to ATRA in terms of inducing CD38 expression .
For example , AML cells are known to express RARa ( 34 ) , though they failed to differentiate morphologically and immunophenotypically , yet showed a significant increase in CD38 antigen following ATRA treatment .
Conversely , HL-6OR cells responded to ATRA treatment in terms of CD38 expression , only when they were transduced to express RARa ; whereas transduction of RARB , RARy , or RXRa receptors could not reconstitute CD38 induction ability in HL-6OR cells in response to ATRA .
Interestingly , all 4 subclones ( RARa , RARB , RARy , and RXRa ) did differentiate to mature granulocytic cells in response to ATRA ( 100 nm , 6 days ) treatment .
These results suggested that induction of CD38 by ATRA is mediated in a receptor-specific manner and is exclusively associated with the presence of functional RARa .
From these studies , it is also evident that induction of CD38 by ATRA is a differentiation-independent phenomenon .
One striking feature of the effects of ATRA on CD38 induction in HL-60 cells was its remarkable specificity .
We took advantage of the fact that HL-60 cells could be induced to differentiate in response to a diverse group of chemical agents and biological response modifiers ( 15 , 35 ) .
The mechanisms of action of these agents are likely to be different from the effects of ATRA .
Compounds such as DMSO , for example , differentiate HL-60 into cells that are functionally , morpho-logically , and immunophenotypically similar to ATRA-treated cells .
However , only ATRA-treated cells showed an induction in CD38 expression .
Treatment of HL-60 cells with other differentiating agents such as , TPA , IFN-y , G-CSF , GM-CSF , and even DMSO , did not result in an appreciable increase in CD38 levels .
This suggests that induction of CD38 is a specific response of HL-60 cells to ATRA rather than a general response of cells to differentiation .
A similar specificity has been reported for induction of 2 other enzyme proteins , transglutaminase ( 36 ) and NAD *-glycohydrolase ( 37 ) .
Recently , NAD *-glycohydrolase activity was shown to be encoded by CD38 in HL-60 cells and was specifically induced by ATRA ( 24 ) .
Contrary to this , suppression of oncogene expression does not share this specific-ity ; both ATRA and DMSO treatment have been shown to inhibit the mye expression in HL-60 cells ( 38 ) .
It would appear that induction of certain enzymes such as transglutaminase and NAD * -glycohydrolase and of CD38 antigen may be selective responses of cells to retinoids , whereas alteration in oncogene expression may be a more generalized consequence of retinoid-induced differentiation .
Another striking feature of CD38 expression in myeloid cells was their sensitivity to ATRA doses at which alterations in the level of this antigen are detected ; fm concentrations of ATRA , which are well below the physiological level ( 1-10 nm ) , can induce significant increases in CD38 expression ( 23 ) .
The presence of a high percentage of CD38-positive cells in freshly isolated bone marrow and blood cells may thus be due to the induction of CD38 molecules by endogenous retinoic acid .
The basal level of CD38 expression in wild type HL-60 cells is much higher ( S/N ratio , 11.4 + 3.2 ) than in HL-6OR cells ( S/N ratio , 1.2 + 0.4 ) that harbors the RARa with decreased affinity for ATRA .
This observation may imply that endogenous retinoids present in serum ( in which the cells were grown ) may be enough to trigger high levels of CD38 in the presence of a functional RARa « .
The observation that the basal level of CD38 expression in APL cells containing t ( 15:17 ) translocation that involves a break in chromosome 17 within RARa gene ( 39 ) was much lower ( S/N ratio , 2.55 + 1.46 ) than in AML cells ( S/N ratio , 34.1 + 21.7 ) containing functional RARa ( 34 ) further supported this premise .
Little information is available on the possible functions CD38 may play in regulation of cell growth and differentiation .

RAR-a-MEDIATED CD38 EXPRESSION IN MYELOID CELLS agonistic CD38 monoclonal antibody indicated that T-lymphocytes can be activated via a CD38-mediated pathway that is independent of CD2 and CD3 ( 40 ) .
This suggests that CD38 may function as a receptor for a yet unidentified ligand .
Recently , another intriguing observation was reported by States et al .
( 41 ) .
Comparison of complementary DNAs encoding human CD38 and ADP-ribosyl cyclase , an enzyme originally isolated from Aplysia californica , revealed a high sequence identity between these 2 proteins .
ADP-bibosyl cyclase catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose , a metabolite of NAD * with calcium-mobilizing activity independent of inositol-triphosphate ( 42 ) .
More recently , Howard et al .
( 43 ) demonstrated that purified CD38 could catalyze the formation as well as hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose .
These observations may suggest that CD38 is a part of a yet-unknown signal transduction pathway that might be responsible for mediating the cellular response to an extrinsic signal .
Further experimentation is needed to clarify these possibilities and to determine the significance of CD38 expression in ATRA-mediated regulation of cell growth and differentiation in myeloid cells .
