Interleukin-10 Inhibits Interferon-y-Induced Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 Gene Transcription in Human Monocytes By Seng Song , Hsiang Ling-Hu , Kenneth A. Roebuck , Mohammed F. Rabbi , Raymond P. Donnelly , and Alison Finnegan Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) is a potent monocyte regulatory cytokine that inhibits gene expression of proinflammatory medi-ators .
In this study , we investigated the mechanism by which IL-10 downregulates expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) on the cell surface of normal human monocytes activated with interferon-y ( IFN-y ) .
IL-10 inhibition of IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 expression was apparent as early as 3 hours and was blocked by an anti-IL-10 antibody but not by an isotype-matched control antibody .
Northern blot analysis showed that IL-10 reduced the accumulation of ICAM-1 mRNA in IFN-y-stimulated monocytes .
IL-10 inhibition of ICAM-1 steady-state mRNA was detected at 3 hours and remained at 24 hours .
Nuclear run-on transcription assays showed that IL-10 inhibited the rate of IFN-y-induced transcription of the ICAM-1 gene , and mRNA stability studies showed that IL-10 did not alter the half-life of NTERLEUKIN-10 ( IL-10 ) is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine attenuating a wide range of immune effector and inflammatory responses ( reviewed in Moore et al ' and Mosmann ' ) .
IL-10 is produced by monocytes/macrophages , B cells , murine Th2 cells , human Th1 and Th2 cells , and some CD8 * cells . '' ''
Activation of monocytes by lipopolysac-charide ( LPS ) and interferon-y ( IFN-y ) induces a broad range of immunologic activities , many of which are suppressed by IL-10 .
For example , IL-10 suppresses production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) , IL-8 , and IL-6 , cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and B7 molecules , and release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates . ''
However , the mechanisms responsible for IL-10 inhibition of monocyte/macrophage function are largely unknown .
In LPS-acti-vated monocytes , IL-10 inhibits cytokine secretion by transcriptional and posttranscriptional means . '' ''
Recent data indicate that IL-10 prevents cytokine gene transcription by inhibiting the transcriptional factor NF- « B .
`` * IL-10 also inhibits LPS-induced p56 lyn activity and the Ras signaling pathway . ''
The mechanism by which IL-10 inhibits IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 in normal human monocytes has not been defined .
ICAM-1 is a glycosylated , integral membrane protein that facilitates selective cellular adhesion .
ICAM-1 is constitu-tively expressed at low levels on a wide variety of cells and can be induced in monocytes by LPS and IFN-y . ''
ICAM-1 expression is transcriptionally regulated'* '' '' ; the promoter contains binding sites for AP-1 , NF- « B , and C/EBP . ''
Recently , Look et al '' identified a consensus IFN-y response element ( IRE ) located at nucleotides -116 to -106 ( relative to the transcription initiation site ) that is necessary for induction of ICAM-1 transcription by IFN-y in epithelial cells . ''
The ICAM-1 IRE is similar to IFN-y response sequences of the FeyRI and IRF-1 genes . ''
IFN-y activates the Janus family tyrosine kinases ( JAKs ) JAK1 and JAK2 , * '' '' which in turn leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the latent transcription factor STAT-1 « ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) .
`` * '' '' Phosphory- Blood , Vol 89 , No 12 ( June 15 ) , 1997 : pp 4461-4469 IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 message .
Thus , IL-10 inhibits IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 expression in monocytes primarily at the level of gene transcription .
Activation of IFN-y-responsive genes requires tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcriptional factor STAT-1a ( signal transducer and activator of transcription-1a ) .
However , IL-10 did not affect IFN-y-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1a or alter STAT1a binding to the IFN-y response element ( IRE ) in the ICAM-1 promoter .
Instead , IL-10 prevented IFN-y-induced binding activity at the NF- « B site of the tumor necrosis factor a { TNF-a ) -responsive NF- « B/C-EBP composite element in the ICAM-1 promoter .
These data indicate that IL-10 inhibits IFN-y-induced transcription of the ICAM-1 gene by a regulatory mechanism that may involve NF- « B .

lated STAT-1a forms a homodimer that translocates to the nucleus and binds to the IRE in promoter regions of IFN-y-responsive genes . '' '' '' '
Feldman et al '' reported that IgG complexes inhibit IFN-y activation of FoyRI gene transcription by preventing phosphorylation and binding of STAT-la to an IRE in the FoyRI promoter .
We were therefore interested in determining whether IL-10 inhibited IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 expression through a similar mechanism .
We demonstrate herein that IL-10 inhibits IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 expression at the level of gene transcription .
In contrast to the mechanism of IgG inhibition of the FeyRI gene , IL-10 did not alter the phosphorylation or binding activity of STAT-1a .
However , IL-10 does prevent NF- « B binding to a proximal DNA element in the ICAM-1 promoter , providing a possible mechanism by which IL-10 could inhibit IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 gene transcription in human monocytes .

RESULTS IL-10 inhibits ICAM-1 cell surface expression .
- To determine the mechanism by which IL-10 inhibits IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 expression , we first characterized cell surface expression of ICAM-1 on human monocytes stimulated with IFN-y or IFN-y plus IL-10 .
Human monocytes were incubated for 16 hours in the presence or absence of recombinant IFN-y ( 100 U/mL ) , IL-10 ( 100 U/mL ) , or both in combination and then analyzed by flow cytometry for ICAM-1 and MHC class II DR cell surface expression .
CD14* monocytes were electronically gated , and the fluorescence intensity of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR was determined .
In five separate experiments , overnight incubation of monocytes spontaneously induced a 4.7-fold increase in ICAM-1 and a 2.6-fold increase in DR expression over that of freshly isolated monocytes ( Table 1 ) .
Incubation of the cells overnight with IFN-y further enhanced this spontaneous expression , producing an additional twofold increase in ICAM-1 and 3.6-fold increase in DR. Overnight incubation of monocytes with IL-10 inhibited both the spontaneous increase in ICAM-1 and DR and the IFN-y-induced increase .
In the absence of IFN-y , inhibition of ICAM-1 by IL-10 ranged from 24 % to 48 % , and DR inhibition was less than that detected on freshly isolated monocytes ( Table 1 ) .
For IFN-y-stimulated monocytes , IL-10 inhibited 16 % to 74 % of the increase in ICAM-1 expression and 50 % to 100 % of the increase in DR expression .
The inhibitory activity of IL-10 was specific , since anti-human IL-10 antibodies but not an isotype-matched control antibody blocked the IL-10 effect ( Table 1 ) .
IL-10 inhibition was concentra-tion-dependent , and the IC ; , was approximately 10 U/mL 4463 Table 1 .

( data not shown ) .
For subsequent experiments , we chose to use 100 U/mL , which produced greater than 80 % inhibition .
Kinetics of IL-10 inhibition of ICAM-1 expression .
To further characterize the effects of IL-10 in monocytes , we examined the kinetics of IL-10 inhibition of ICAM-1 expression at the protein and mRNA levels .
Human monocytes were incubated for 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 , and 24 hours in the presence or absence of recombinant IFN-y ( 100 U/mL ) , IL-10 ( 100 U/mL ) , or both in combination and then analyzed by flow cytometry for ICAM-1 cell surface expression .
IFN-y induction of ICAM-1 was detected as early as 3 hours and continued to increase over the 24-hour time course ( Fig 1A ) .
IL-10 inhibited IFN-y induction of ICAM-1 at all time points examined .
To determine if IL-10 inhibited ICAM-1 mRNA expression , we examined steady-state levels of ICAM-1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis .
Monocytes were stimulated in the presence or absence of IFN-y ( 100 U/mL ) and/ or IL-10 ( 100 U/mL ) for 3 or 24 hours .
IFN-y increased ICAM-1 mRNA , and IL-10 inhibited this induced expression at both time points ( Fig 1B ) .
The correlation between cell surface expression and steady-state levels of mRNA suggests that IL-10 inhibits ICAM-1 expression by reducing the accumulation of ICAM-1 mRNA .

Monocytes were untreated ( control ) or treated with IFN-y ( 100 U/mL ) , IL-10 ( 100 U/mL ) or the combination for the indicated times .
( A ) Cell surface expression was measured by flow cytometry .
Monocytes were identified by staining with PE-labeled anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , and ICAM-1 was identified on CD14* cells by staining with FITC-labeled anti-ICAM-1 mAb .

( C ) Normalized absorption values were obtained by densitometry scanning of ICAM-1 and GAPDH mRNA bands .
From the ratio of ICAM-1 to GAPDH , the fold increase over untreated control cells was calculated .
Data are representative of 3 experiments .
in transcription of the ICAM-1 gene and/or an increase in degradation of ICAM-1 mRNA .
We performed nuclear run-on assays to determine if IL-10 inhibited ICAM-1 gene transcription .
Nuclei isolated from monocytes activated with IFN-y in the presence or absence of IL-10 for 3 hours were monitored for ICAM-1 transcription .
IFN-y increased the rate of ICAM-1 gene transcription in monocytes , and IL-10 prevented this increased transcription ( Fig 2 ) .
These data demonstrate that IL-10 regulation of ICAM-1 in monocytes is mediated at least in part by transcription .
It has been reported that IL-10 , in addition to inhibiting cytokine gene transcription , in some instances enhanced mRNA degradation . ''
To determine if IL-10 alters the half-life ( , ) of ICAM-1 mRNA , we used Actinomycin D to block transcription in activated monocytes and determined the rate of mRNA degradation by Northern blot analysis .
Monocytes were stimulated with IFN-y alone or IFN-y plus IL-10 for 16 hours .
Actinomycin D ( 5 pg/mL ) was then added to prevent further mRNA synthesis .
RNA was isolated at different time points , and ICAM-1 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot .
There was a steady reduction in ICAM-1 mRNA over the 3-hour period , with a t , , , of about 1 hour ( Fig 3 ) .
However , IL-10 did not enhance the rate of ICAM-1 mRNA degradation , suggesting that IL-10 does not alter ICAM-1 mRNA stability .
Taken together , these data demonstrate that IL-10 inhibits IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 expression primarily at the level of gene transcription .
Effect of IL-10 on STAT-1a binding activity .
- TFN-y has been shown to activate the transcription factor STAT-1 @ .
`` * '' ° Look et al '' described an IRE in the ICAM-1 promoter between nucleotide positions -116 and -106 that is required for ICAM-1 promoter induction by IFN-y .
To determine whether the IRE motif could bind IFN-y-induced or IL-10-induced DNA binding proteins in monocytes , we synthesized a 20-bp oligonucleotide encompassing the IRE , pre- pared nuclear extracts from IFN-y-treated monocytes in the presence or absence of IL-10 for 0.5 and 1 hour , and assessed DNA binding activity by EMSA .
IFN-y induced a complex that was evident as early as 30 minutes ( Fig 4 ) .
In contrast , IL-10 induced two weak complexes : one comigrated with the IFN-y-induced complex , and the second migrated more slowly .
When IFN-y and IL-10 were combined to stimulate monocytes , we detected a dominant complex corresponding to the IFN-y-induced complex and a much weaker complex corresponding to the slower-migrating IL-10 complex .
These data show that IL-10 does not inhibit the IFN-y-induced complex .
Competitive-inhibition studies demonstrated the specific-ity of the IFN-y-activated IRE binding complex .
We used the c-sis inducible element ( SIE ) from the c-fos promoter shown previously to bind STAT-1 @ , '' * to assess whether the IRE is also recognized by STAT-1a .
Nuclear extracts from monocytes stimulated with IFN-y plus IL-10 were incubated with labeled IRE and a 100-fold molar excess of IRE or SIE .
Both the IRE and the SIE competed for proteins binding to the IRE , whereas no competition was observed for an unrelated ICAM-1 Sp1 binding sequence ( Fig 5 ) .
These data demonstrate that IFN-y and IL-10 induced specific gel shift complexes on the ICAM-1 IRE that may contain STAT-1 @ .
To directly demonstrate the presence of STAT-la , we incubated STAT-la @ antibody with nuclear extracts and assessed the effects on binding activity by EMSA .
Anti-STAT-la antibody supershifted the IFN-y-induced IRE binding complex , whereas the anti-fos B antibody had no effect on the binding complex ( Fig 6A ) .
The combination of IFN-y and IL-10 also induced an IRE binding complex that was supershifted by the anti-STAT-1 @ antibody .
These data demonstrate that IL-10 does not alter STAT-1a binding to the ICAM-1 IRE .

Effect of IL-10 on STAT-1a phosphorylation .
- STAT-la is rapidly activated by tyrosine phosphorylation , which allows STAT-1la dimers to bind IRE sequences . '' '' '' '' '' ''
Because we were unable to identify a difference in STAT-la binding in the presence of IL-10 , it appears that IL-10 does not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1 « @ .
To directly demonstrate this , we immunoprecipitated from IFN-y-activated monocytes in the presence or absence of IL-10 .
Adherent monocytes were treated with cytokines for 5 minutes , solubilized , and immunoprecipitated with anti 4465 STAT-la antibody .
The immunocomplexes were washed , resolved on 8 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 .
In monocytes treated with IFN-y and IL-10 ( Fig 7 , lane 4 ) , there was approximately the same level of STAT-1a « phosphorylation versus IFN-y alone ( lane 2 ) .
Normalization of phosphorylated STAT-1 @ « to the level of STAT-1a protein by laser densitometry showed that an equivalent amount of phosphorylated STAT-la was detected from IFN-y and IFN-y plus IL-10 precipitates .
These data in combination with the DNA binding experiments indicate that IL-10 does not inhibit the activity of IFN-y by altering the binding activity of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT-1a protein .

- Kinetics of IFN-y and IL-10 induction of DNA binding activity on ICAM-1 IRE .
Nuclear extracts were obtained from monocytes unstimulated ( control ) or stimulated with IFN-y ( 100 U/mL ) , IL-10 { 100 U/mL ) , or the combination of IFN-y and IL-10 and analyzed for DNA binding activity in gel mobility shifts using labeled ICAM-1 IRE .

from IFN-y-stimulated monocytes to oligonucleotides corresponding to binding sites for AP-1 , AP-2 , AP-3 , and Spl ( data not shown ) .
The ICAM-1 promoter contains two NF- « B sites located distal ( nucleotides -540 to -528 ) and proximal ( nucleotides -228 to -217 ) to the transcription start site .
These NF- « B binding sites have not been previously identified to be involved in IFN-y-induced transcription of the ICAM-1 gene .
However , because recent data indicate that IL-10 can inhibit NF-kB binding activity in LPS-stimulated monocytes , '' * we assessed NF- « B binding activity in IFN-y-activated monocytes .
We synthesized oligonucleotides that correspond to the distal and proximal NF- « B elements in the ICAM-1 promoter and assessed their binding activity by EMSA .
IFN-y increased DNA binding activity of the proximal NF-KB site , and IL-10 markedly reduced this binding activity ( Fig 8 ) .
In contrast , IFN-y did not induce DNA binding activity of the distal NF-KB site ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that IL-10 can inhibit IFN-y-induced NF- « B binding activity of the ICAM-1 promoter in monocytes .
DISCUSSION In this study , we investigated the mechanism by which IL-10 inhibits ICAM-1 expression in human monocytes acti- SONG ET AL vated with IFN-y .
We show that regulation of ICAM-1 by IL-10 occurs at the level of gene transcription and not at the level of mRNA stability .
These observations suggest that IL-10 targets transcription factors interacting with the ICAM-1 promoter elements .
Feldman et al '' '' reported that IgG complexes inhibit FeyRI gene transcription in monocytes by inhibiting phosphorylation and binding activity of STAT-la .
However , we were unable to detect any effect of IL-10 on IFN-y induction of STAT-1a phosphorylation or binding to the ICAM-1 IRE .
These findings suggest that IL-10 inhibition of ICAM-1 may involve a novel mechanism distinct from that used to downregulate the FoyRI gene .
It is interesting that ICAM-1 expression in microglial cells , macrophage-like cells in the central nervous system , is induced by IFN-y stimulation and inhibited by IL-10 . ''
However , unlike the effect in human monocytes , IL-10 does not inhibit ICAM-1 mRNA accumulation .
In microglial cells , IL-10 affects ICAM-1 expression at the translational and/or posttranslational level , whereas in human monocytes it affects transcription . ''
There are several possible differences between these two cell populations .
Microglial cells are a differentiated macrophage-like cell , and transcriptional activation of genes in monocytes is developmentally regu-lated . '' ''
Also , since microglial cells are rodent-derived , the differences may be due to species differences .
There are a number of possible mechanisms that may be responsible for inhibition of IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 transcription in monocytes .
Several observations indicate that not only tyrosine phosphorylation but also serine phosphorylation is required for transcriptional activity of STAT proteins .

Monocytes were stimulated with IFN-y ( 100 U/mL ) in the presence or absence of IL-10 ( 100 U/mL ) for 5 minutes .
Cells were lysed , and STAT-la was immunoprecipitated with Sepharose-bound anti-STAT-1 antibody .
Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE , blotted to nitrocellulose , probed with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody ( 4610 ) , and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence .
In the lower panel , the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT-1 antibody and developed .
Data are representative of 2 separate experiments .
serine phosphorylation correlates with decreased STAT-1a @ binding activity .
Wen et al '' '' demonstrated that cells expressing a mutant form of STAT-1 in which Ser-727 was changed to alanine could be phosphorylated on tyrosine and bound specific IRE sites ; however , serine phosphorylation was required for full IFN-y activity .
Thus , IL-10 may alter serine phosphorylation of STAT-1a proteins , which in turn would influence transcription of the ICAM-1 gene .
Another possible way IL-10 could influence IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 transcription is through the induction of STAT-3 binding to the ICAM-1 IRE .
The IRE in the ICAM-1 gene is similar to other IFN-y-responsive elements in c-fos , and IRF-1 genes .
`` > '' ** '' * The IFN-y-responsive element ( GRR ) of the FeyRI gene has been used to identify DNA binding proteins that are induced by IFN-y and IL-10 .
It has been reported that IFN-y induces STAT-1 « @ , '' * '' ° and IL-10 induces predominately STAT-3 .
`` ° STAT-1 « and STAT-3 can form both homodimers and heterodimers . ''
It is possible that since IFN-y induces STAT-la and IL-10 induces STAT-3 , IL-10 inhibits ICAM-1 transcription by altering the composition of dimers formed on the IRE .
In IFN-y-activated monocytes , STAT-1a would form homodimers capable of activating the ICAM-1 promoter , whereas in IL-10-activated monocytes , there would be mostly STAT-3 homodimers , which can not activate the ICAM-1 promoter .
Consequently , the combination of IFN-y/IL-10 could produce heterodimers of STAT-1a « and STAT-3 that may function as an inhibitory complex , thereby reducing ICAM-1 transcription .

IL-10 inhibits binding of NF- « B to a proximal site in the ICAM-1 promoter .
Monocytes were stimulated with IFN-y ( 100 U/ mL ) , IL-10 { 100 U/mL ) , or IFN-y plus IL-10 in combination for 5 minutes .
Nuclear extracts were analyzed for gel mobility shifts with the labeled ICAM-1 proximal NF- « B oligonucleotide .
Data are representative of 3 separate experiments .
IL-10 in monocytes is the reduction in cytokine synthesis .
Although IL-10 controls cytokine production at the level of transcription , little is known about the mechanism .
Experiments from Geng et al '' '' showed that LPS induces the early tyrosine kinase p56 lyn in monocytes and that IL-10 inhibits p56 lyn activity .
Since tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for LPS activation of IL-1 , IL-6 , and TNF-a , this may be the mechanism by which IL-10 inhibits cytokine production .
Wang et al '' '' also reported that LPS- and NF- « B activity is inhibited by IL-10 .
They postulated that since NF-KB activity is required for transcription of many cytokine genes , this may be a common mechanism by which IL-10 inhibits transcription .
Consistent with a role for NF- « B in IL-10 inhibition , we showed that IL-10 inhibited binding of IFN-y-induced nuclear factors to the proximal ICAM-1 NF- « B binding site .
These data suggest that NF- « B may be necessary for maximum IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 transcription in monocytes .
It is of interest that the proximal NF- « B element is a functional element in ICAM-1 transcription regulating TNF-a responses . ''
Recently , it was shown in epithelial and endothelial cells that mutation of the proximal NF-KB site reduced IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 transcription . ''
In addition , IFN-y activation of the IP-10 gene is regulated by cooperative interactions between STAT la and NF- « B .
* '' Future experiments using transfection of the ICAM-1 promoter elements will determine if IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 transcription is regulated by NF- « B and whether IL-10 inhibition specifically localizes to the proxi- SONG ET AL mal NF- « B binding site .
Taken together , these observations suggest that IL-10 inhibition of IFN-y-induced ICAM-1 transcription is complex and may involve the interaction of multiple transcription factor binding sites .
