Stimulation of cells leads to a rapid phosphorylation of IxBa , which is presumed to be important for the subsequent degradation .
We have recently reported the establishment of a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -dependent cell-free activation system of NF- « B in association with the induction of IxBa phosphorylation .
In this study , we have identified a kinase in cell extracts from the LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line , THP-1 , that specifically binds and phosphorylates IxBa .
LPS stimulation transiently enhanced the IxBa-bound kinase activity in THP cells .
Mutational analyses of IxBa and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as Ser and Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of IxBa .
Moreover , we show that the peptide , corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of IxBa , blocked the LPS-induced NF-B activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous IxBa in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells .
These results suggested that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of IxBa and subsequent dissociation of the NF-xB-IrxBa complex .
NF- « B consists of a family of transcriptional factors that play a key role in the regulation of a number of immune and inflammatory response genes ( 1-3 ) , including several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 '' and IL-6 ( 4-6 ) .
Members of the family include p65 ( RelA ) , RelB , c-Rel , p50 ( NF- « B-1 ) , and p52 ( NF- « B-2 ) .
NF- « B is retained in an inactive form being associated with its inhibitors , IxB , in the cytoplasm in most types of cells ( 7 ) .
Following stimulation of cells with a variety of agents , e.g .
IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , phorbol myristate acetate , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , NF- « B is released from IB and is translocated to the nucleus and binds to the NF-kB binding * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

sites , thereby activating the transcription of a set of target genes ( 1-3 ) .
I « B family proteins possess the ankyrin-like repeats , which are thought to interact with the Rel homology region of NF- « B ( 8 ) .
This family includes large precursors of p50 and p52 , and p105 and p100 , respectively , which contain ankyrin repeats in their C-terminal region ( 9-11 ) .
Cytoplasmic IxBa , encoded by the MAD-3 gene ( 12 ) , is thought to be a major target in the signal transduction pathway .
I « Ba is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo in response to cell stimulation ( 13-16 ) and is degraded thereafter by proteasomes ( 13-18 ) .
Recently , while several groups have demonstrated that phosphorylation of I « Ba is not sufficient to activate NF- « B in vivo ( 14-19 ) , the inducible phosphorylation of I « xBa may be required for converting IkBa into an appropriate proteasome substrate .
In contrast , we previously demonstrated that LPS induced NF-KB activation without a significant loss of I « Ba in a cell-free system using the monocytic cell line , THP-1 ( 20 ) .
Lack of degradation of IxBa was also observed upon TNF-induced NF- « B activation in a cell-free experiment using U937 cells ( 21 ) .
These observations would imply that appropriate phosphorylation of IxBa can activate NF- « B by dissociating from IxBa in a signal-dependent manner .
In vitro phosphorylation of IxBa by several serine/threonine kinases , including protein kinase C and protein kinase A , prevents its binding to NF- « B ( 22-24 ) , suggesting that IxBa phosphorylation on specific phosphorylation sites is sufficient for the dissociation of IxBa from NF- « B .
However , none of these kinases tested so far in vitro appears to be responsible for the activation of NF-KB in vivo ( 25 , 26 ) .
To our knowledge , the I « Ba kinase , which is responsible for the phosphorylation of I « Ba in vivo , has not yet been biochemically identified and character-ized .
In this study , we have identified a kinase in LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line ( THP-1 ) extracts that specifically binds and phosphorylates IxBa .
Moreover , we have identified the acidic domain in the C-terminal region of I « Ba as the phosphorylation target sites for this kinase .
A peptide substrate for the bound kinase , corresponding to the acidic domain , inhibited the LPS-mediated NF-kB activation in a cell-free system ( 20 ) , suggesting that phosphorylation of I « Ba « at the acidic domain by the kinase is critical for NF- « B activation .

as described previously ( 20 ) .
Immunoprecipitation and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis-After the in vitro kinase reaction in a cell-free system using the postnuclear fractions in the presence of LPS ( 20 ug/ml ) , samples were incubated with anti-IxBa antiserum ( 28 ) at 4 °C for 3 h. Precipitates were collected on a protein G-Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) and analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE .
Phosphorylated IxBa , identified by autoradiography , was excised from the gel and subjected to phosphoamino analysis as described ( 82 ) .
RESULTS Identification of a Protein Kinase That Binds and Phosphorylates IxBa-Many transcriptional factors play pivotal roles in cellular events leading to cell proliferation , differentiation , and immune responses .
Phosphorylation is presumed to be a crucial step for the regulation of subcellular localization and transac-tivation capacity of many of these factors .
Some of the key protein kinases , such as Jun kinases , have been recently identified as enzymes associated with their targets ( 31 ) , probably due to a highly specific interaction with their substrates in vivo .
With regard to the activation of NF- « B in response to LPS and inflammatory cytokines , an inducible phosphorylation of IxBa is thought to be prerequisite for subsequent activation of NF- « B after inactivation of I « Ba .
To characterize a protein kinase ( s ) that can specifically bind to IxBa , cytosolic extracts were prepared from LPS-stimulated THP cells and incubated with GST-IxBa-conjugated GSH-Sepharose beads .
After washing the GSH beads extensively , a solid phase in vitro kinase reaction was performed .
As shown in Fig .
14 , GST-IxBa fusion protein but not GST was phosphorylated only in the presence of cytosolic extract in this binding/kinase reaction .
These data implied that the cytosolic fraction contained a protein kinase that phosphorylated I « Ba after binding to it .

transiently enhanced the IxBa-bound kinase activity in intact THP-1 cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
The activity was enhanced about 2-fold at 2 min after LPS stimulation compared with a basal level and decreased thereafter .
Furthermore , phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated I « Ba in the binding/kinase reaction revealed that the I « xBa-bound kinase is serine and threonine specific ( data not shown ) .
The Bound Kinase ( s ) Phosphorylates an Acidic Domain in C-terminal Region of IxBa-To further characterize the I « Ba-bound kinase , we tried to partially purify the bound kinase on the basis of the binding/kinase assay using GST-IxBa as a substrate .
The bound kinase was partially purified from cytosolic extract of LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells through three steps : Red-Sepharose , DEAE-sephacel column chromatography , and DEAE-HPLC ( see `` Materials and Methods '' ) , resulting in a 120-fold purification .
To determine the region ( s ) of IxBa that interacted with the kinase ( s ) , several truncated mutants of GST-IxBa fusion proteins were expressed ( Fig .
24 ) , and the ability of the kinase ( s ) to phosphorylate these mutated IxBa was tested in a binding/ kinase assay .
As shown in Fig .
3A , mutant del-4 , which lacks a 72-amino acid N-terminal region , or del-5 , which lacks both N-terminal region and 3 ankyrin repeats , was still phosphorylated by the partially purified bound kinase ( s ) .
In contrast , the deletion of the C-terminal 35 amino acids ( del-10 ) but not of 25 amino acids from C-terminal ( del-9 ) abolished the phosphorylation of IxBa by the kinase ( s ) .
These data demonstrated the interaction of the acidic domain within the C-terminal region of IxBa with the bound kinase .
To further directly delineate the IxBa phosphorylation sites , the effects of truncations of IxBa were also examined in an in vitro kinase reaction using a partially purified kinase .
As shown in Fig .
3B , mutant del-9 was phosphorylated by the bound kinase to a similar level as wild type IxBa .
However , when del-10 or del-1 mutant was used as a substrate , no phosphorylation was detected .
Furthermore , GST-I « Ba mutant K , in which six Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain were changed to Ala ( Fig .
2B ) , was not phosphorylated by the kinase ( Fig .
3B ) .
These data indicate that the major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase resided within the C-terminal acidic domain of IkBa .
Ser-293 Was a Major Phosphoacceptor of IxBa by the Bound Kinase-There are six Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of I « Ba , which are surrounded by acidic residues on both the N-terminal and C-terminal sides .

The bound kinase phosphorylates the C-terminal acidic domain of IxBa .

Partially purified IxBa-bound kinase from THP cells was incubated with GSH-Sepharose beads conjugated with 2.5 ug of wild type ( w¢ ) GST-I « Ba or equimolar of deletion mutants .
After an extensive washing , a kinase reaction was performed in the presence of [ y-* '' P ] JATP as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Reaction products were analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE and autoradiography .
B , the effects of mutations of I « xBa on its phosphorylation in an in vifro kinase reaction .
Partially purified IxBa-bound kinase from THP-1 cells was incubated with 0.5 ug of wild-type GST-IxBa protein or equimolar mutated GST-IkBa proteins in the presence of [ y-*°P ] JATP as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
The reaction products were analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE and autoradiography .
To confirm the C-terminal phosphorylation by the bound kinase , we constructed the peptide AR , corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of I « Ba , residues 279-303 ( Fig .
2B ) , and performed a competition experiment in an in vitro kinase assay .
As shown in Fig .
44 , phosphorylation of the GST-IkBa « by the bound kinase was significantly inhibited by the peptide AR but not by a MAPK peptide substrate .
These results suggest that the C-terminal acidic region is a major phosphorylation site for the kinase .
In addition , a specific substrate for the CKII ( 33 ) did not compete at the same concentration , suggesting the possibility that the bound kinase is distinct from CKIL .
To determine more precisely the phosphoacceptor sites on the acidic domain of I « Ba , we prepared a series of mutated peptides in four Ser/Thr residues within the critical region of peptide AR and tested their capacities to be phosphorylated by the bound kinase .
As shown in Fig .
4B , when the Ser-293 was replaced by Ala , phosphorylation of the peptide by the bound kinase was significantly reduced .
The substitution of Ser-288 or Thr-291 to Ala decreased the phosphorylation by 20-30 % , whereas that of Ser-283 retained a similar level of phosphorylation as the wild type protein .
These data suggest that Ser-293 was a major phosphoacceptor site and that Ser-288 and Thr 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Kinase 125 ® 100 T T £ 0 ® 0 75 on is o A - so # 0 £ o m - 25 3 0 p © £ € E 4 .

Acidic Domain Peptide Blocks NF-kB Activation in a Cell-free System-Previously , we established the LPS-dependent NF- « B activation in a cell-free system ( 20 ) .
This system has a great advantage since highly specific peptide inhibitors can be directly added .
We have also demonstrated that an inducible phosphorylation of IxBa correlated with LPS-mediated NF-kB activation in the same assay system ( 20 ) .
Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that IxBa phosphorylation after LPS stimulation in a cell-free system occurred at serine and threonine residues ( Fig .
5 ) , while no phosphorylation of these residues was detected without LPS stimulation ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate the activation of serine/threonine kinase by LPS stimulation in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells .
To assess the physiological role of the IxBa-bound kinase ( s ) in the signaling pathway of LPS , we examined in a cell-free system the inhibitory activity of the bound kinase substrate , AR peptide of IxBa , as well as other inhibitory peptides .
As shown in Fig .
6A , LPS-mediated NF- « B binding was significantly inhibited by addition of AR peptide of I « xBa .
In contrast , neither a CKII substrate nor a MAPK substrate affected the NF- « B activation .
Furthermore , AR peptide of IkBa also blocked an inducible phosphorylation of IxBa ( Fig .
6B ) in the same assay .
These results strongly suggest that the bound kinase is essential for the LPS-dependent activation of NF- « B in THP-1 cells through an inducible phosphorylation of the C-terminal acidic domain of IxkBa .
DISCUSSION In this study , we have identified a protein kinase in the cytosolic fraction of a human monocytic cell line , THP-1 , that can specifically bind and phosphorylate I « Ba .
The bound kinase is serine/threonine kinase , and its activity was transiently increased by in vivo stimulation with LPS in intact THP-1 cells , indicating that the I « xBa-bound kinase is located downstream of the LPS signaling cascade .
Mutational analysis of the IxBa substrate revealed that the IxBa-bound kinase phosphorylated the Ser/Thr residues within the C-terminal acidic domain of I « xBa .
This notion is supported by the competition experiment with the synthetic peptide AR F T La s. G £ 2 nd O + ist = Fic .

Phosphoamino acid analysis of IxBa phosphorylated in the cell-free system after LPS stimulation .
After kinase reaction with a postnuclear fraction ( 100 ug of protein ) in a cell-free system in the presence of LPS ( 20 ug/ml ) for 5 min , IxBa was immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE , then subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis as described under `` Materials and Methods .

corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of I « Ba ( Fig .
4A ) .
Incomplete competition by AR peptide for IxBa phosphorylation in Fig .
4A may be due to lower affinity of AR peptide to the kinase compared with a full-length IxBa .
It is possible that the synthetic peptide AR may be somehow sterically different from native phosphorylation sites and/or that some other parts may affect the interaction with the bound kinase in addition to actual phosphoacceptor sites .
Moreover , we have demonstrated here that AR peptide was a substrate for the bound kinase and that the peptide significantly suppressed LPS-mediated NF- « B activation in a cell-free system .
Previously , we found a correlation between an inducible phosphorylation of IxBa and the activation of NF- « B in response to LPS without apparent degradation of I « Ba in the same system ( 20 ) .
Furthermore , we show here that the substrate for the bound kinase also blocked the inducible phosphorylation of IxBa in a cell-free system .

The substrate of IxBa-bound kinase blocks NF-KB activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of IxBa in response to LPS stimulation in a cell-free system .
A , plasma membrane-enriched and cytosolic fractions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the absence ( Zane 2 ) or presence ( Zanes 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) of LPS ( 20 ug/ml ) without ( Zanes 1 and 2 ) or with 15 nM of CKII substrate ( Zane 3 ) , MAPK substrate ( Zane 4 ) , or peptide AR of IxBa ( Zane 5 ) , respectively .
Then , EMSA was performed using NF- « B binding site of the human IL-8 gene promoter as a probe .
B , kinase reaction was performed in a cell-free system with a postnuclear fraction ( 40 ug of protein ) in the absence ( lane 1 ) or presence ( Zanes 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) of LPS ( 20 ug/ml ) without { lanes 1 and 2 ) or with 15 nM of AR peptide of IxBa ( lane 3 ) , MAPK substrate ( ane 4 ) , and CKII substrate ( Zane 5 ) .
IxBa was immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa « antibody and analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE .
Taken together , these findings demonstrate that in a cell-free system using a monocytic cell line , THP-1 , the I « Ba-bound kinase phosphorylates the C-terminal acidic domain of IxBa in response to LPS stimulation , leading to dissociation of IxBa from NF- « B .
IxBa is rapidly phosphorylated by cell stimulation , followed by degradation in vivo ( 13-17 ) .
Several groups argued that phosphorylation of I « Ba is not sufficient for NF- « B activation , based on their findings that proteasome inhibitors blocked the activation of NF- « B with accumulation of the phosphorylated form of I « Ba ( 15 , 16 ) and that the phosphorylated form of IxBa could be coimmunoprecipitated with p65 in several cell lines including Hela cells ( 14 , 15 ) .
Recently , Brown et al .
( 34 ) demonstrated that two Ser residues in the N-terminal region of human I « Ba are important for its degradation in a mouse T cell line , EL-4 .
On the other hand , a recent study showed that phosphorylation states of IxBa were remarkably different in each cell type ( 14 ) .
Thus , we speculate that the discrepancy between these studies and our finding in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells may be ascribed to the difference in the cell types and stimuli .
In addition , DiDonato et al .
( 16 ) reported that IxBa was phosphorylated at multiple sites after TNFa stimulation in Hela cells .
Therefore , the function of I « Ba might be differentially regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites .
It was shown that the C-terminal region of IxBa , containing a PEST-like motif , was also important for a signal-dependent proteolysis in vitro and in vivo in addition to the N-terminal region ( 34 , 35 ) .
However , the role of phosphorylation within the C-terminal acidic domain in an inducible proteolysis remains to be elucidated .
It is known that IB associates with Rel family proteins using its ankyrin repeat .
The C-terminal acidic region of IxBa was recently shown to be involved in an inhibitory activity for DNA binding of c-Rel or p65 ( 28 , 36 ) .
Here , we show that the peptide substrate for the bound kinase blocked NF-KB activation in a cell-free system .
Ernst et al .
( 28 ) , however , reported Kinase that a synthetic peptide , corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain , by itself could not inhibit DNA binding activity .
Sim-ilarly , we observed that the peptide substrate for the bound kinase did not affect NF- « B binding activity in EMSA when nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were used as a source of NF- « B . ''
These findings exclude the possibility that the acidic domain peptide directly inhibits the DNA binding activity of NF- « B in a cell-free assay .
In addition , these studies demonstrated that NF-kB made contact with two sites of IxBa , ankyrin repeats and an acidic domain .
Thus , it is likely that phosphorylation within this acidic region of I « xBa may change its affinity for NF-KB .
Mutational analysis of GST-I « Ba and the substrate for the bound kinase revealed that Ser-293 within the acidic domain is a major phosphoacceptor site by the bound kinase and that Ser-288 and Thr-291 are minor ones .
The sequence motifs of these phosphorylation sites are distinct from those of the pro-line-directed protein kinases , including MAPK , Jun kinase , and p38 ( 37-39 ) , which were recently shown to be activated by LPS , IL-1 , or TNF stimulation in several cell lines .
In addition , the recognition sites of the bound kinase are also distinct from protein kinase C acceptor sites , although several groups reported the involvement of protein kinase C in LPS-signaling pathway ( 40 ) and the capacity of protein kinase C to phosphorylate IxBa in vitro , resulting in a dissociation from the NF- « B-IxBa complex .
The major phosphorylation site , Ser-293 , is distinct from a CKII acceptor site since it lacks an acidic residue at a third position of the C-terminal side , which is essentially required for CKII recognition ( 33 ) .
On the other hand , one of the minor phosphorylation sites , Thr-291 , belongs to a CKII acceptor site .
We found that CKII substrate could not inhibit IxBa phosphorylation at the same concentration at which the bound kinase substrate blocked it .
At this moment , we can not exclude the possibility that the acidic domain of IxBa is more physiological substrate for CKII or its related molecules than the typical CKII substrate .
Photoaffinity labeling by 8-azido-ATP of a partially purified kinase fraction suggested that the molecular mass of the IxBa-bound kinase is 42 kDa . ''
However , further efforts will be required for the purification and molecular cloning of the kinase .
NF- « B plays a central role in the regulation of gene activation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFa .
Previously , our group demonstrated that the activation of NF- « B is indispensable for the gene activation of human IL-8 ( 6 ) , which is a member of the leukocyte chemotactic cytokine ( 41 ) .
In this study , we have demonstrated that a peptide substrate for the IxBa-bound kinase blocked the activation of NF-kB in a cell-free system .
This finding suggests that specific peptides regulating the signaling pathway to induce NF- « B activity , such as the IxBa-bound kinase substrate , can target NF- « B and possibly be developed as a novel class of an anti-inflammatory drug .
