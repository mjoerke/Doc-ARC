Yuging Liu , ** Joanne M. Cousin , * ' Jeremy Hughes , * Jo Van Damme , * Jonathan R. Seckl , '' Christopher Haslett , '' Ian Dransfield , '' John Savill , '' * and Adriano G. Rossi ' Phagocyte recognition , uptake , and nonphlogistic degradation of neutrophils and other leukocytes undergoing apoptosis promote the resolution of inflammation .
This study assessed the effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids on this leukocyte clearance mechanism .
Pretreatment of `` semimature ' '' 5-day human monocyte-derived macrophages ( M ) for 24 h with methylprednisolone , dexamethasone , and hydrocortisone , but not the nonglucocorticoid steroids aldosterone , estradiol , and progesterone , potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils .
These effects were specific in that the potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils was completely blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 , and glucocorticoids did not promote 5-day Mo ingestion of opsonized erythrocytes .
Similar glucocorticoid-mediated potentiation was observed with 5-day Mo uptake of alternative apoptotic `` targets '' ( eosinophils and Jurkat T cells ) and in uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by alternative phagocytes ( human glomerular mesangial cells and murine Mo elicited into the peritoneum or derived from bone marrow ) .
Importantly , methyl-prednisolone-mediated enhancement of the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils did not trigger the release of the chemokines IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 .
Furthermore , longer-term potentiation by methylprednisolone was observed in maturing human monocyte-derived Mo , with greater increases in 5-day Mo uptake of apoptotic cells being observed the earlier glucocorticoids were added during monocyte maturation into Mo .
We conclude that potentiation of nonphlogistic clearance of apoptotic leukocytes by phagocytes is a hitherto unrecognized property of glucocorticoids that has potential implications for therapies aimed at promoting the resolution of inflammatory diseases .
microorganisms and repair damaged tissues , become unde- sirably persistent in a number of disease states .
Although there is strong evidence that leukocytes can mediate tissue injury in inflammatory disorders ( 1 ) , little is known of the mechanisms that promote the resolution of inflammation by eliminating leukocytes from tissues .
An important factor in the successful resolution of inflammation is the recognition , uptake , and degradation by phagocytes of intact leukocytes undergoing deletion by apoptosis ( 2-9 ) .
Not only are tissues protected from the noxious contents of leukocytes , but apoptotic cells are also rapidly phagocytosed and degraded by professional phagocytes ( macrophages and by semiprofessional phagocytes ( e.g. , glomerular mesangial cells , fi- I nflammatory responses , which evolved to eliminate invading *Division of Renal and Inflammatory Disease , School of Medical and Surgical Sci-ences , University Hospital , Nottingham , United Kingdom ; *Rayne Laboratory , Respiratory Medicine Unit , University of Edinburgh Medical School , Edinburgh , United Kingdom ; *Katholicke Universiteit Leuven , Rega Institute , Leuven , Belgium ; and *Molecular Medicine Centre , Western General Hospital , Edinburgh , United Kingdom Received for publication August 5 , 1998 .

Although several molecular pathways by which phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells have been identified ( reviewed in Refs .
13 and 14 ) , the mechanisms that control phagocytic capacity for the clearance of apoptotic cells are less well understood .
The modulation of phagocyte capacity for apoptotic cell clearance represents a potential therapeutic target in the control of inflammatory dis-ease .
Although CD44-mediated increases in the Mo uptake of apoptotic neutrophils may hold some therapeutic promise ( 15 ) , it is unlikely that there is clinical utility in the observation that proinflammatory cytokines promote Mo ingestion of apoptotic cells ( 16 ) .
Therefore , we sought to investigate further the regulatory mechanisms that might control phagocyte clearance of leukocytes undergoing apoptosis .
It is well established that glucocorticoids are powerful anti-inflammatory agents that suppress many phlogistic responses including inflammatory cell recruitment and activation ( 17-20 ) .
However , there have been relatively few studies of the effects of these steroids on the resolution phase of inflammation .
We and others have shown that glucocorticoids delay constitutive apoptosis in neutrophils , whereas eosinophil apoptosis is accelerated ( 21-23 ) , providing an attractive explanation for the therapeutic efficacy of glucocorticoids in eosinophilic inflammation .
However , implicit in this observation is the need for nonphlogistic clearance of an increased tissue load of apoptotic eosinophils , implying that glucocorticoids might also up-regulate the phagocytic capacity for apoptotic granulocytes so that greater numbers are safely removed .
Moreover , although glucocorticoids delay neutrophil apoptosis , these agents are effective in suppressing inflammatory responses characterized by intense infiltration of tissues with neutrophils ( 24 ) that will eventually undergo apoptosis , implying that glucocorticoids may also up-regulate the phagocyte capacity to clear apoptotic neutrophils .
0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3640 To test the hypothesis that glucocorticoids potentiate phagocyte capacity for the nonphlogistic clearance of apoptotic leukocytes , we have undertaken the first study of the effects of glucocorticoids upon this process , which is important in the resolution of inflammation .
We report that glucocorticoids specifically promote safe clearance by various phagocyte types of apoptotic leukocytes from different lineages , establishing that glucocorticoids have hitherto unrecognized but beneficial regulatory effects upon phagocytes , which may promote the safe termination of inflammatory responses .

Granulocyte isolation and induction of apoptosis Human neutrophils ( > 98 % pure on May-Giemsa-stained cytopreparations ) were isolated from fresh , citrated blood of healthy volunteers by dextran sedimentation and discontinuous plasma-Percoll ( Pharmacia Fine Chemi-cals ) density gradient centrifugation ( 2 , 25 ) .
The neutrophils were aged in tissue culture at 37°C and 5 % CO , for 24 h in Iscove 's DMEM with 10 % autologous platelet-rich , plasma-derived serum to undergo apoptosis verified by typical morphology ( 2 ) .
Only aged neutrophils with a viability ( assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion ) > 98 % were used .
Human eosinophils ( 95-98 % pure on May-Giemsa-stained cytopreparations ) were isolated from the blood of mildly eosinophilic but healthy human volunteers by using a combination of discontinuous plasma-Percoll density gradient centrifugation to obtain eosinophil-enriched granulocyte populations followed by immunomagnetic depletion of neutrophils using 3G8 CD16 mAb , essentially as described ( 6 , 26 ) .
Purified eosinophils were then cultured for up to 72 h in conditions identical to those for neutrophils to undergo apoptosis verified by typical morphology ( 26 ) .
Only aged eosinophils with viability > 98 % by trypan blue dye exclusion were used .
Preparation of human monocyte-derived Md Human monocytes were prepared by well-established methods from the mixed mononuclear cell band of the discontinuous plasma-Percoll gradients used to prepare neutrophils ( 2 ) .
Mononuclear cells were suspended in Iscove 's DMEM at 4 X 10°/ml , and 100 pl was added to each well of a 96-well plate , which was then incubated at 37° for 1 h. Nonadherent cells , including contaminating lymphocytes , were then washed off , and adherent monocytes were cultured in Iscove 's DMEM with 10 % autologous platelet-rich , plasma-derived serum for 5 days to mature into monocyte-derived Mo .
Preparation of murine Md populations Ten-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from the University of Nottingham Biomedical Facility and were housed and treated under U.K. Home Office-approved conditions .
Thioglycollate-elicited inflammatory peritoneal Mo and bone marrow-derived M were prepared as described ( 27 ) .
Briefly , inflammatory peritoneal exudate Mo were elicited into the peritoneal cavity of 10-wk-old female BALB/c mice by injection of 3 % Brewer 's thioglycollate and harvested 5 days later after humane killing by peritoneal lavage with DMEM medium alone .
Exudate cells were adhered to 96-well plates for 1 h at 0.1 X 10° cell/well , and nonadherent cells were washed off and replaced with DMEM containing 10 % FCS plus supplements as above .
Peritoneal Mo were used within 48 h after isolation .
Bone marrow-derived Mo were isolated from femurs of humanely killed mice , cut at both ends , and the bone marrow expelled by flushing with a 25-gauge needle with DMEM with 10 % FCS supplements as above and 10 % conditioned medium from L929 cells as a source of monocyte-CSF .
were employed after 7-10 days culture .
GLUCOCORTICOIDS PROMOTE SAFE PHAGOCYTOSIS OF APOPTOTIC CELLS Culture of human mesangial cells Mesangial cells were prepared using standard methods of serial culture/ trypsinization in tissue culture flasks of adherent outgrowth cells from glo-meruli obtained by sieving diced human normal renal cortex as described previously ( 3 , 11 ) .
Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % FCS and 5 m1/500 ml of insulin/selenium/transferrin growth supplement from Life Technologies Laboratories ( Grand Island , NY ) and were used between passages four and six after subculture into 96-well plates .
Great care was taken to verify the purity and phenotype of mesangial cells , as previously described ( 3 , 11 ) .
Cells were uniformly smooth muscle actin-positive and CD4S-negative ( by immunofluorescence ) .
Cells did not take up acetylated low-density lipoprotein or opsonized zymosan particles ( ex-cluding Mo contamination ) and were cytokeratin and factor VIII-related Ag-negative ( by immunofluorescence ) , excluding contamination with glomerular epithelial or endothelial cells .
Culture of Jurkat T cells and induction of apoptosis Cells of the Jurkat T cell line ( a gift from C. Gregory , University of Not-tingham ) were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 with 5 % FCS and supplements .
To induce morphologically verified apoptosis , cells were deprived of serum with cycloheximide at 50 pg/ml for 4 h before being washed and employed in interaction assays with Mo .
Interaction assays A microscopically quantified phagocytic assay of Mo phagocytosis of aged polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) was used , which has been described and illustrated in detail before ( 2 , 28 ) .
Minor adaptations for Mo cultured in 96-well plates have been described ( 16 ) .
Briefly , PMNs aged for 24 h in culture , to undergo apoptosis , were washed once in HBSS , suspended in Iscove 's DMEM , and 0.5 X 10° aged PMNs in 50 ul of medium were added to each washed well of Mo .
After interaction for 30 min at 37°C in 5 % CO , atmosphere , the wells were washed in saline at 4°C to remove noningested apoptotic PMNs , fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0.9 % saline , stained for myeloperoxidase ( MPO ; present in PMNs but not Mo ) using hydrogen peroxide and dimethoxybenzidine as substrate as previously described ( 2 , 29 ) , and then the proportion of Me ingesting neutrophils were counted by inverted light microscopy , exactly as described ( 2 , 28 ) .
Because it was also important to determine whether the phagocytic capacity of individual M had been increased , the number of PMNs within 100 randomly selected Mo in each well was counted in some experiments .
These counts were possible because the duration of the phagocytic assay was sufficiently short for ingested PMNs to remain intact ( 2 , 28 , 29 ) .
The Mo uptake of aged apoptotic eosinophils , 0.1 X 10° in 50 ul medium for each well of Mo or of IgG-opsonized human erythrocytes ( EIgG ) , 0.1 % 10° in 50 ul medium for each well of Mo , was determined by similar means , as described ( 26 , 28 ) , because these cell types also stain for per-oxidase .
The uptake of apoptotic Jurkat T cells was assessed by staining with Haemalum ( BDH , Poole , U.K. ) , as described ( 4 ) .
To quantify mesangial cell phagocytosis of apoptotic PMNs , we used a previously described , reproducible , microscopically quantified assay in which the uptake of apoptotic PMN was shown by electron microscopy and susceptibility to inhibition by colchicine to be a result of active phagocytosis ( 3 ) .
Culture medium was aspirated from the mesangial cells , and 50 ul of a 20 X 10 % /ml suspension of neutrophils in RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS was added to each well together with 50 pl of Iscove 's DMEM .
The two cell types were cocultured in 5 % CO , at 37°C for 3 h , and the interaction was then stopped by the addition of cold normal saline and the removal of nonadherent cells by manual washing with a Pasteur pipette .
The mesangial cell monolayer was then trypsinized , and a separate cyto-centrifuge preparation was prepared for each well .
These were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde and stained for MPO and finally counterstained with Haemalum .
The proportion of mesangial cells containing brown MPO-positive globules wholly within the outline of the cell was then counted by light microscopy with a minimum of 500 cells per slide being counted .
Effect of steroid hormones Before interaction with apoptotic leukocytes , M¢ or mesangial cells were preincubated for varying durations of time in medium plus supplements/ serum , as described above , containing the desired final concentration of steroid hormone .
Control wells were left undisturbed in medium plus sup-plements/serum .
However , preliminary experiments ( not shown ) demonstrated that the replacement of medium after aspiration at the preincubation times used did not , in itself , alter the phagocytic signal .
6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology Effect of glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 The effect of glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 was assessed using final concentrations of RU38486 or ethanol-based vehicle control > 10-fold those employed for glucocorticoids .
Medium was aspirated from phagocytes 24 h before assay of phagocytosis and was replaced by 180 pl of RU38486 at 11.1-fold final steroid concentration in medium plus supplements/serum as above .
Twenty minutes later , 20 pl of medium plus supplements/serum containing no steroid ( as a control ) or steroid at 10-fold final concentration was added , and the phagocytes were incubated for the desired period until interaction with apoptotic leukocytes .
Effect of cycloheximide The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was included at 2.5 M for 12 h in medium plus supplements/serum + steroid before assay of phagocytosis of apoptotic leukocytes .
Assessment of Md and mesangial cell response following the ingestion of apoptotic PMNs Monocyte-derived Mo in 24-well plates were either incubated in Iscove 's DMEM alone or interacted with apoptotic PMNs or opsonized zymosan .
After 30 min , Mo were carefully washed , and 250 pul Iscove 's DMEM was added to each well .
After 24 h coculture with Mo , the medium was aspi-rated , centrifuged , and stored at -80°C .
Mo phagocytosis of neutrophils or zymosan was quantified by fixing three of the wells on each plate with 2 % glutaraldehyde and , in the case of neutrophils , by staining for MPO as outlined previously .
The proportion of M ingesting apoptotic neutrophils or opsonized zymosan was counted by inversion light microscopy ( 28 ) .
Mesangial cells in 96-well plates were either cultured in the presence of RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS with or without 10 ng/ml IL-1 for 6 h or interacted for 3 h with apoptotic PMNs as previously outlined .
Mesangial cells were then carefully washed with normal saline , and the medium was replaced with 50 pl of RPMI 1640 without FCS and incubated at 37°C .
The medium was aspirated after 24 h , centrifuged , and stored at -80°C .
Cy-tocentrifuge preparations from 4 wells on each plate were used to quantify mesangial cell phagocytosis of apoptotic PMNs .
Measurement of IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) levels in tissue culture supernatants IL-8 and MCP-1 levels were measured by ELISA using a peroxidase conjugate for detection .
Briefly , assay plates were coated with protein A-pu-rified goat polyclonal Ab against pure natural IL-8 ( 30 ) or rabbit polyclonal Ab against recombinant MCP-1 ( 31 ) .
Samples were tested at 1/10 dilution .
Immunoreactivity was specifically measured using mAbs against IL-8 and MCP-1 ( R & D Systems , Abingdon , U.K. ) , respectively , as secondary Abs .
Detection was obtained by peroxidase-conjugated , affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG .
The ELISA for IL-8 and MCP-1 were specific because natural forms of other chemokines including MCP-2 , MCP-3 ( 32 ) , granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 , ENA-78 , GROa , inflammatory protein-10 , NAP-2 ( 33 ) , or cytokines ( IL-1 , IFN-y , IFN-B ) were not detectable .
The sensitivity of the MCP-1 and IL-8 ELISA were < 1 ng/ml and < 100 pg/ml , respectively .
Statistical methods All values are expressed as mean + SEM of the indicated number of experiments .
Statistical significance ( defined as p < 0.05 ) was evaluated using Student 's £ test and where appropriate by one-way ANOVA with comparison between groups using the Newman-Keuls procedure .
Results Glucocorticoids specifically promote phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by semimature monocyte-derived Md To facilitate the detection of possible potentiating effects upon Mo phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils ( 16 ) , we studied `` semimature '' cultures of human monocyte-derived Mo matured for 5 days in adherent culture on plastic because maximal capacity for the uptake of apoptotic cells generally requires maturation for around 7 days ( 29 ) .
Pretreatment of 5-day Mo with the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone ( Fig .
1 ) or dexamethasone ( data not shown ) for different periods of time up to 24 h caused a progressive increase in the proportion of Mo that were capable of phagocytosing apoptotic neutrophils and in the number of apoptotic neutrophils ingested per Mo .

24 h augmented the number of apoptotic neutrophils ingested per 100 phagocytically active Mo from 138.9 + 4.1 to 209.6 + 5.1 ( p < 0.01 ; a = 9 ) .
Short preincubation times ( < 3 h ) were without effect ( Fig .
1 ) , excluding the remote possibility that there was a `` carry over '' effect of glucocorticoid treatment of Mo upon added apoptotic neutrophils .
The specificity of glucocorticoid effects upon Mo phagocytosis was further investigated by comparison of the effects of pretreatment of Mo for 24 h with a number of different steroids .
These studies demonstrated that methylprednisolone , dexamethasone , and hydrocortisone acted in a concen-tration-dependent manner to augment phagocytosis ( Fig .
2 ) , whereas the mineralocorticoid aldosterone at 5 nM , a concentration 10-fold above that inducing maximal effects on sodium transport in vitro ( 34 ) , and the sex steroids progesterone ( 1 uM ) and estradiol ( 1 M ) were without effect ( Table I ) .
The specificity of the observed augmentation of Mo phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by glucocorticoids was further demonstrated by the failure of glucocorticoid pretreatment to induce either binding or phagocytosis of nonapoptotic neutrophils ( data not shown ) and the lack of effect of methylprednisolone on the phagocytosis of EIgG ; in a series of nine experiments , pretreatment for 24 h with methylprednisolone at 200 nM increased the proportion of 5-day Mo ingesting apoptotic neutrophils from 14.1 + 1.5 % to 29.6 + 3.2 % ( mean + SE , p < 0.001 ) but had no significant effect on the proportion of 5-day Mo ingesting EIgG ( untreated 5-day Mo 52.7 + 6.4 % vs methylprednisolone-treated 5-day Mo 54.3 + 7.1 % ) .
Glucocorticoid promotion of Md uptake of apoptotic neutrophils is specific for the glucocorticoid receptor and inhibitable by cycloheximide To confirm that glucocorticoids were acting via Mo steroid recep-tors , we assessed the effect of the specific steroid receptor antagonist RU38486 upon glucocorticoid-promoted 5-day Mo phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils ( Fig .
3 ) .
RU38486 used at a 10-fold greater concentration than the glucocorticoids completely blocked increased phagocytosis stimulated by 24-h treatment with 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3642 40 R Methylprednisolone BA Dexamethasone EH Hydrocortisone + ** % Mo ingesting apoptotic PMNs control - 10 nM 50 nM 100 nM 200 nM 400 nM 800 nM 1000 nM Concentration of glucocorticoids FIGURE 2 .

methylprednisolone , dexamethasone , and hydrocortisone without exhibiting any independent inhibitory effect upon Mo phagocytosis of apoptotic cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Together with the lack of effect upon Mo phagocytosis of EIgG cited above , these data argue strongly against a nonspecific `` membrane '' effect on Mo .
Furthermore , methylprednisolone failed to promote phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by Mo pretreated for 12 h with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( a reversible blocker of mRNA transla-tion ) at 2.5 uM , a concentration previously shown to inhibit > 95 % of protein synthesis in myeloid cells and to inhibit Mo phagocytosis of apoptotic cells without toxic effects on the Mo , as evidenced by retained ability to ingest opsonized erythrocytes ( 35 , 36 ) .
Thus , in a series of seven experiments in which 15.7 + 1.7 % ( mean + SE ) of 5-day Mo ingested apoptotic neutrophils under control conditions and 12-h pretreatment with methylprednisolone at 200 nM increased recognition to 38.3 + 4.2 % ( p < 0.001 vs control ) , such glucocorticoid pretreatment was unable to reverse the inhibitory effect of concomitant 12-h pretreatment with cycloheximide at 2.5 uM , which significantly reduced the proportion of Mo ingesting apoptotic neutrophils whether Mo had been treated with methylprednisolone ( 4.9 + 0.9 % , p < 0.001 ) or not ( 5.7 + 1.4 % , p < 0.001 ) .

Glucocorticoids also promote phagocytosis in other models of phagocyte clearance of apoptotic cells In view of the observation that ligation of Mo CD44 specifically promotes phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils , having little effect upon uptake of apoptotic cells of other lineages ( 15 ) , it was of interest to determine whether the prophagocytic effect of glucocorticoids upon Mo was restricted to uptake of apoptotic neutrophils .
This proved not to be the case in that methylprednisolone also promoted phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells from 13.4 + 1.4 % of Mo under control conditions to 24.2 + 1.5 % after 24-h culture with 200 nM methylprednisolone ( mean + SE , rn = 6 , p < 0.001 ) .
Furthermore , 24-h incubation of Mo with 1 uM dexamethasone increased Mo phagocytosis of apoptotic eosinophils from 49.0 + 3.9 % to 67.8 + 5.1 % ( mean + SE , n = 6 , p < 0.001 ) .
We were also concerned to establish whether the prophagocytic effect of glucocorticoids was limited to the human monocyte-derived Mo , because previous work has established that other phagocyte populations recognize apoptotic cells by mechanisms distinct from the « yf ; vitronectin receptor/thrombospondin/CD36 system characterized in the human monocyte-derived Mo ( reviewed in Ref .
13 ) .
Human mesangial cells , `` semiprofessional '' glomerular phagocytes , which usually recognize apoptotic neutrophils by a CD36-independent , mechanism ( 11 ) also exhibited increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils when treated with glucocorticoids ( Fig .
4 ) .
Furthermore , this effect was not limited by phagocyte species in that glucocorticoids exhibited a similar promotion of phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by murine bone marrow-derived Mo populations and murine thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal inflammatory Mo ( Fig .
5 ) , which normally employ ay B , -independent phosphatidylserine receptors in the uptake of apoptotic cells ( 27 ) .
Glucocorticoid-promoted uptake of apoptotic cells does not promote proinflammatory secretory responses by phagocytes Growing evidence supports the concept that phagocyte clearance of leukocytes undergoing apoptosis is an injury-limiting leukocyte 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology disposal mechanism likely to promote the resolution of inflammation ( reviewed in Ref .
37 ) .
Strong support is provided by data that demonstrate that Mo and mesangial cells phagocytosing apoptotic cells are not stimulated to secrete proinflammatory eicosanoids , granule enzymes , or cytokines ( 6 , 10 , 11 ) .
The wide-ranging anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids suggested that the promotion of phagocyte clearance of apoptotic cells would be unlikely to provoke proinflammatory responses from ingesting phagocytes , but it was clearly necessary to test this assumption .
We found that increases in Mo uptake of apoptotic neutrophils induced by methylprednisolone pretreatment did not invoke the release of the proinflammatory chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 by Mo ( Table II ) or mesangial cells ( Table III ) .
However , methylprednisolone at 200 nM failed to abrogate IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion triggered by Mo phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan particles ( Table III ) , indicating that glucocorticoids were not acting to suppress production of these chemokines by Mo .
During monocyte maturation , earlier and more prolonged exposure to glucocorticoid results in greater potentiation of Md phagocytic capacity at 5 days Although human monocyte-derived Mo are able to ingest senescent neutrophils undergoing apoptosis , freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes lack this capacity , which is progressively acquired over several days as adherent monocytes cultured with autologous serum differentiate into Mo ( 29 ) .
Because the mechanisms responsible are very poorly understood , we considered it possible that early exposure of maturing monocytes to glucocorticoids might undesirably disrupt acquisition of the capacity to ingest apoptotic neutrophils .
In fact , the earlier maturing monocytes were exposed to 200 nM prednisolone throughout subsequent culture , the greater ( compared with control ) the potentiation of the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils at 5 days ( Fig .
6 ) .

Discussion This report establishes the capacity of glucocorticoids to promote nonphlogistic phagocytosis of cells undergoing apoptosis .
This effect was specific in that in human monocyte-derived Mo treated for 24 h from 4 days ' maturation it was mediated via the RU48686-inhibitable steroid receptor , not induced by the mineralocorticoid aldosterone or by sex steroids , and not observed for FcR-mediated phagocytosis .
Furthermore , there was evidence of a generally relevant promotion of phagocyte clearance of apoptotic cells in that glucocorticoids promoted Me phagocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat T lymphocytes and apoptotic eosinophils as well as promoting the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by both human glomerular mesangial cells and two different populations of murine Mo .
Finally , the promoting effect of glucocorticoids was not limited to `` semimature '' 4-day Mo because earlier exposure to glucocorticoid during Mo differentiation resulted in a still greater capacity for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells at 5 days .
The data provide new insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids , demonstrating a hitherto unrecognized mechanism by which these agents may ameliorate inflammatory injury ( the promotion of safe phagocytic clearance of leukocytes being 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3644 GLUCOCORTICOIDS PROMOTE SAFE PHAGOCYTOSIS OF APOPTOTIC CELLS Table II .

deleted by apoptosis ) .
Data from in vitro studies emphasize that glucocorticoids may coordinately promote the deletion of certain leukocyte types by engaging apoptosis ( 22 , 23 , 38 ) , while at the same time up-regulating the capacity for phagocytic clearance ( this study ) .
Recently published observations that steroid treatment of asthma is associated with the resolution of eosinophilic inflammation and increased evidence of eosinophil phagocytosis by bron-cho-alveolar Mo provide evidence that similar mechanisms may operate in vivo in man ( 8 ) .
Furthermore , although glucocorticoids slow constitutive apoptosis in neutrophils ( 21 , 23 ) , glucocorticoid-treated neutrophils eventually undergo apoptosis and therefore require phagocytic clearance in vivo to prevent secondary necrosis with the resultant release of toxic granule contents .
Further studies will be required to establish whether these findings can be extrapolated to inflammatory conditions in different tissues in vivo .
However , it appears likely that the observed increases in both the proportion of M ingesting apoptotic neutrophils and in the number of ingested cells per phagocytically active Mo will equate to a significant increase in clearance capacity in vivo .
Nevertheless , our observation that glucocorticoid-mediated enhancement of Mp phagocytosis of apoptotic cells was not achieved by a costly loss of the teleogically appropriate lack of proinflammatory response by the phagocyte is of fundamental im-portance .
Methylprednisolone-enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic cells failed to stimulate IL-8 and MCP-1 release from either Mo or mesangial cells .
By contrast , under the conditions employed , methylprednisolone did not suppress Mo release of IL-8 and MCP-1 after phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan .
These findings were underscored by comparable observations when mesangial cells were employed as the phagocyte , where IL-1 was employed as a positive control stimulus ( 11 , 30 ) instead of opsonized zymosan .
Therefore , failure to elicit a proinflammatory response did not merely reflect a general suppression of chemokine synthesis by glucocorticoids , which has been reported in other in vitro systems ( reviewed in Ref .
24 ) .
The modulation of phagocyte capacity for uptake of apoptotic cells by glucocorticoids exhibits interesting differences from previous reports on the regulation of phagocytosis of these and other particles .
In contrast to CD44-mediated enhancement of Mo uptake of apoptotic neutrophils ( 15 ) , the prophagocytic effect of glucocorticoids required several hours of treatment and was unable to reverse inhibition by cycloheximide , consistent with a requirement for new protein synthesis .
Moreover , unlike CD44 ligation , prophagocytic effects were not restricted to apoptotic target cells of the neutrophil lineage .
Furthermore , in other phagocytic systems glucocorticoids have been reported to inhibit rat alveolar Mo ingestion of carbon particles ( 39 ) and murine Mo phagocytosis of heat-killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 40-43 ) .
Nevertheless , freshly isolated human monocyte phagocytosis of B-glucan particles prepared from the same species of yeast was enhanced by glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone at 200 nM ( 44 ) , and there are reports that glucocorticoids up-regulate Mo receptors for cytokines , including those for granulocyte-M & CSF ( 45 ) , which can promote Mo uptake of apoptotic cells ( 16 ) .
Consequently , the current data are not necessarily inconsistent with previous studies of the glucocorticoid regulation of phagocytosis .
Further studies will be needed to define mechanisms by which glucocorticoids potentiate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells .
Our preliminary immunofluorescence flow cytometry studies ( data not shown ) on 5-day human monocyte-derived Mo treated with 200 nM methylprednisolone for 24 h have shown no detectable difference in Mo surface expression of components of the « , f ; vitronectin receptor/thrombospondin/CD36 recognition mechanism ( 35 ) and a modest down-regulation of CD14 consistent with previous reports ( 46 ) , suggesting that up-regulated expression of these surface receptors is unlikely to account for the potentiating effects Table IM .

of glucocorticoids .
This work on surface receptor expression will need to be expanded , and possible effects of glucocorticoids on cytoskeletal elements ( 47 ) should also be considered .
Lastly , although hydrocortisone and dexamethasone might appear to be equipotent in our studies , comparisons of concentrations at which different glucocorticoids exert a similar effect in vitro should be made with considerable caution because ABC transporters such as MDR1A can expel synthetic glucocorticoid substrates such as dexamethasone from within leucocytes ( 48 ) , with the result that the effective concentration of glucocorticoid at the intracellu-lar receptor is lower than the extracellular concentration applied to the cell .
In conclusion , we report that glucocorticoids specifically enhance the nonphlogistic phagocytic uptake of apoptotic leukocytes of differing lineages by human and murine Mo populations and also `` semiprofessional '' phagocytes , glomerular mesangial cells .
The data add new emphasis to the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids and suggest that further work could identify novel therapeutic approaches toward promoting the safe resolution of inflammatory conditions .
