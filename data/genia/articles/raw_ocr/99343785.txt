Wong , ** Gary M. Kammer , '' Greg Dennis , '' and George C. Tsokos*** Numerous cellular and biochemical abnormalities in immune regulation have been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , including surface Ag receptor-initiated signaling events and lymphokine production .
Because NF-KB contributes to the transcription of numerous inflammatory genes and has been shown to be a molecular target of antiinflammatory drugs , we sought to characterize the functional role of the NF-xB protein complex in lupus T cells .
Freshly isolated T cells from lupus patients , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , and normal individuals were activated physiologically via the TCR with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs to assess proximal membrane signaling , and with PMA and a calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) to bypass membrane-mediated signaling events .
We measured the NF-KB binding activity in nuclear extracts by gel shift analysis .
When compared with normal cells , the activation of NF-KB activity in SLE patients was significantly decreased in SLE , but not in RA , patients .
NF-xB binding activity was absent in several SLE patients who were not receiving any medication , including cortico-steroids .
Also , activity remained absent in follow-up studies .
In supershift experiments using specific Abs , we showed that , in the group of SLE patients who displayed undetectable NF-KB activity , p65 complexes were not formed .
Finally , immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts showed decreased or absent p65 protein levels .
As p65 complexes are transcriptionally active in comparison to the p30 homodimer , this novel finding may provide insight on the origin of abnormal cytokine or other gene transcription in SLE patients .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 163 ; 1682-1689. bnormalities in T cells have been described in patients A with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) * ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
Studies have identified molecular defects that include : an increase in intracellular calcium flux in response to TCR ligation ( 3 ) , aberrant protein tyrosine phosphorylation ( 4 ) , and abnormal cAMP regulation ( 5-7 ) .
Additional aberrations have been identified in cell surface molecule expression , such as CD40 ligand ( L ) ( 8 , 9 ) , FasL ( 10 ) , defective cytotoxic cell function ( 11 ) , TGF-B production ( 12 ) , and activation-induced cell death ( 13 ) .
Another defect that has been well described in T cells is the deficient synthesis of IL-2 when T cells are stimulated by mitogens ( 14-17 ) .
The mechanism for this defect at the molecular level remains unclear .
IL-2 production is regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level and requires signaling through the TCR and the CD28 costimulatory molecule ( 18-22 ) .

Although all three transcription factors contribute in the activation of IL-2 , in primary human T cells , NF-KB has been shown to be an important factor in initiating the transcriptional response to TCR and CD28 ligation , expression of IL-2 , and proliferation ( 24-27 ) .
The transcription factor NF- « B is pervasive in immune tissues and plays an important function in the regulation and the development of the immune response through the regulation of cytokines and cell surface markers ( reviewed in Refs .
28-31 ) .
The NF- « B/Rel protein family has many members and consists of DNA binding proteins that interact to form dimers with one another through a region termed the Rel homology domain .
The Rel domain is a highly conserved 300-aa region that mediates protein-protein interaction and DNA binding .
There are five genes for the NF- « B/Rel family in humans : NF- « B1 ( p50 ) , NF- « B2 ( p52 ) , RelA , cRel , and Rel B .
These factors mediate nuclear responses to a wide variety of inducers , such as cytokines , bacterial products , viral products , apoptotic signals , and other forms of cellular stress .
NF- « B binding sites can be identified in the promoter region of numerous genes that are activated in response to TCR ligation , including IL-2 ( 19 ) , GM-CSF ( 28 , 29 ) , IL-4 ( 30 ) , and FasL ( 31 ) .
The critical role of NF-KB in T cell activation and IL-2 production can best be seen in transgenic mice that have homologous deletion of genes for specific NF- « B subunits .
These mice display impaired T cell activation and low levels of IL-2 , supporting the vital function of the NF- « B family in T cell function ( 32 ) .
Although the T cell effector dysfunction seen in SLE can be a direct consequence of surface membrane-initiated signaling abnor-malities , altered nuclear transcription factor expression may add to the immunopathogenesis of the disease .
Because IL-2 is one of the earliest cytokines expressed after TCR ligation , and the nuclear factors that regulate IL-2 production have been identified , we sought to understand the regulation of NF-KB in lupus and conducted experiments to investigate the regulation of the NF-KB 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology pathway in SLE T cells .
Our results show that SLE T cells display defective inducible forms of NF- « B activity .
Materials and Methods Lymphocyte isolation Peripheral blood was donated by volunteers after informed consent was obtained from normal and diseased individuals according to protocols approved by the source institutions as per Walter Reed Army Medical Center Human Use Committee protocol 3727-98 .
PBMC were separated from RBC on Lymphoprep gradient ( Nycomed Pharma , Oslo , Norway ) , as recommended by the manufacturer .
T cells were separated subsequently by rosetting with neuraminadase-treated SRBC by incubating PBMC and SRBC at 4°C overnight , followed by further separation of T cells by centrifugation on Lymphoprep gradient .
Rosetted T cells were centrifuged and washed with PBS .
SRBC were removed by incubating for 5 min in ACK lysing buffer ( 0.15 M NHgqCI , l mM KHCO , 0.1 mM EDTA ) , followed by dilution with five times excess RPMI .
T cells were washed and separated by centrifugation at 1400 X g , and the cells were resuspended in RPMI 10 % FCS and rested for 18 h at 37°C before stimulation .
The purified cells are > 95 % positive for CD3 .
Immediately before stimulation , cells were washed in fresh RPMI 10 % FCS and resuspended in a 1-ml volume with the appropriate activating agent .
The volume was brought up to 5 ml , and cells were incubated for the remaining time after stimulation at 37°C in a 5 % CO , incubator .
Antibodies Abs to NF- « B subunits were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) : anti-p50 Ab , anti-p52 Ab , anti-c-Rel Ab , anti-p65 ( RelA ) N-terminal Ab , anti-p65 ( RelA ) C-terminal Ab , and anti-ReIB Ab .
Anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) was purchased from Ortho Biotech ( Rantan , NJ ) , and anti-CD28 Ab was purchased from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) .
Protein immunoblotting Western blot analysis was performed as described by Harlow and Lane ( 33 ) .
A total of 15 pg of protein extracts was denatured at 95°C in 2 % laemmli buffer for 2 min and loaded onto 10 % Trig glycine SDS gel ( Novex , San Diego , CA ) and electrophoresed at 125 V constant .
Protein was transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Milli-pore , Bedford , MA ) in transfer buffer at 14 V for 3 h. The membranes were washed in PBS and blocked with PBS + 3 % dry milk for 1 h and incubated in primary Ab ( 1:1000 dilution ) for 2 h. The membrane was then washed in PBS for 5 min with three changes of buffer , reblocked for 1 h , and then probed with secondary Ab at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. The membrane was washed in PBS + 0.05 % Tween six times for 5 min each , and the bands of interest were visualized by chemiluminescence ( Pierce , Rockford , IL . ) .
Protein isolation At least 10 million T cells were used for preparation of extracts for each experimental point .
T cells following treatment with appropriate stimulus were washed three times in PBS , and cells were extracted for protein essentially as described ( 34 ) .
Cells were resuspended in buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES-KOH ( pH 7.9 ) at 4°C , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KCl ) with protease inhibitor mixture ( 1 uM PMSF , 1 gM DTT , 2 pg/pl leupeptin , 1 pg/ml aprotinin , 5 mM NaF , 1 mM sodium vanadate ) at a concentration of 200 pl per 10 million cells .
Cells were incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 1000 X g. The cell pellets were then resuspended in buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES-KOH ( pH 7.9 ) , 25 % glycerol , 420 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA with protease inhibitor mixture ) and incubated for 30 min on ice followed by brief sonication and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in mi-crofuge for 30 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration quantified using Bio-Rad ( Richmond , CA ) protein assay .
The protein extract was then stored at -80°C until needed for EMSA and Western blot analysis .
EMSA Double-stranded « B oligos , 5'-gatcccaacggcaggggaattcecctctectta and the complement strand , were custom synthesized from Life Technologies ( Grand Island , NY ) .
The « B oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [ y- > °P ] ATP ( NEN/DuPont , Boston , MA ) using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Unincorporated label was separated using Sephadex G50 ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) spin col-umn .
For binding reaction , 15000 cpm of radiolabeled xB oligonucleotide was incubated with 1 ug of lymphocyte protein extract in binding buffer in the presence of 1 ug poly ( dI-dC ) ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) as nonspecific competitor .
The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at room tem- 1683 perature and loaded on 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA buffer .
The gel was then dried under vacuum on blotting paper and the protein DNA complexes visualized by autoradiography .
Data analysis For analysis of the optical density of the band for NF-B , autoradiograms were scanned with a Hewlett-Packard ( Palo Alto , CA ) scanner and analyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image program version 1.61 .
The relative optical density on the autoradiogram was recorded , and statistically significant differences were determined by the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test .
Statistical significance comparing treated patients to untreated patients was determined by the one-way ANOVA .
Results TCR-mediated induction of NF-KB is defective in SLE T cells After stimulation through the TCR using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs , efficient activation of NF- « B activity can be readily detected in primary T cells isolated from the peripheral blood by EMSA ( Fig .
1A ) .
Stimulation solely through the TCR by anti-CD3 mAb did not effectively activate NF-KB , as shown in Fig .
14 .
The development of doublet bands , which disappear in the presence of excess unlabeled « B oligonucleotide , demonstrate the specificity of DNA binding by NF- « B .
Time course experiments determined the optimal time for the detection of NF- « B in primary T cells to be 6 h after stimulation .
Although NF- « B was activated after 3 h ( 5-fold ) , greater levels of DNA binding were consistently detected at 6 h ( 5.5- to 7-fold ) .
This activation of the NF-KB is best followed by the slower migrating upper band , which disappears when competed with an excess of unlabeled « B-specific oligonucleotide ( Fig .
14 ) .
Protein extracts from freshly isolated T cells from SLE patients were analyzed for NF- « B binding activity following stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs .
NF- « B binding activity , as determined by EMSA in nine SLE patients , displayed both qualitative and quantitative differences when compared with that seen in normal T cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
The intensity , when measured by densi-tometry , of the upper band was > 2 SD below the normal mean in five patients ( SLE4 , SLE18 shown in Fig .
1 , A and D ) , decreased , as defined by an intensity between 1 and 2 SD below the normal mean , in four patients ( SLE6 and SLE19 in Fig .
1C ) .
The lower band , which is also specific for NF-kB binding , was similar in stimulated and unstimulated T cells in both normal and SLE T cells ( Fig .
1 , A , C , and D ) .
To determine whether the observed decreased NF-KB binding activity was limited to SLE patients , T cells from eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) were analyzed .
All protein extracts from RA T cells showed detectable upper bands for NF-KB , albeit of less intensity than normal T cells in certain RA patients ( Fig .
1D ) .
Also , T cells from patients with a low-grade T cell malignancy ( cutaneous T cell lymphoma ) did not show abnormal NF- « B activation ( data not shown ) .
Activation of NF-KB in SLE T cells with PMA and A23187 It has been shown previously that certain TCR-mediated signaling events , such as increases in intracytoplasmic calcium ( 3 ) and tyrosine phosphorylation ( 4 ) , are abnormal in lupus T cells .
To determine whether the novel abnormality in NF- « B activation in SLE patients was the result of defective initiation of signaling at the cell surface through the Ag receptor and CD28 receptors , PMA and the calcium ionophore , A23187 , which activate in normal T cells NF- « B through intracellular second messenger pathways , were used to assess the activation of NF- « B in SLE T cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
SLE T cells were stimulated with PMA/A23187 , protein extracts were isolated at 6 h , and the extracts were analyzed for kB binding activity .

A , Activation of NF-B in normal T cells .
Purified T cells were activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb or with anti-CD3 mAb for the time indicated .
Nuclear extracts were isolated from T cells at the time indicated after activation , and 1 ug of protein was analyzed in EMSA .
Arrows indicate specific bands that bound to the « B oligonucleotide .

was seen when compared with normals .
Out of 18 patients ana-lyzed , the intensity of the upper band was > 2 SD below the normal mean in nine patients , between 1 and 2 SD below the normal mean in seven patients , and within 1 SD of the normal mean in two patients .
This finding suggests that a defect in the regulation of NF- « B binding activity resided downstream from the surface signaling machinery .
In certain lupus individuals , T cells were stimulated by both methods , either with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs or PMA/A23187 .
The levels of induced NF- « B binding activity when stimulated by these two methods were always found to be concordant in an SLE patient ( Fig .
2C ) .
Defective NF-KB activation in SLE T cells is not the result of abnormal kinetics of activation We considered the possibility that abnormal induction of NF- « B in SLE T cells may reflect aberrant kinetics of NF-KB activation .
The anti-CD3 mAb-mediated increased tyrosine phosphorylation in lupus T cells has been shown to reach peak levels earlier than in normal T cells ( 4 ) .
Therefore , we tested whether SLE T cells , which displayed abnormal activation when stimulated with PMA/ A23187 or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs , showed abnormal kinetics of NF- « B activation .
Fig .
3 shows the NF-KB binding activity in SLE T cells at times 0 , 3 , and 6 h after initiation of stimulation .
The kB binding activity remained absent throughout the time pe riod analyzed .
In contrast , the level of NF-KB seen in normal lymphocyte extracts was rapidly induced and remained stable over the time course that was studied .
p65 , but not p50 , activity is abnormal in lupus T cells NF- « B is composed of five genetically distinct family members that , through protein-protein interactions , form homo- or heterodimers that constitute « B DNA binding activity ( 35 ) .
To define the NF-KB abnormality in SLE T cells , we added Abs specific to various members of the NF- « B family in the EMSA binding reaction with SLE extracts .
As shown in Fig .
4 , only the p50 subunit is detected by DNA binding assays in extracts isolated from unstimulated normal T cells , whereas the other NF- « B family members are not detected as part of the DNA binding complex ( Fig .
4 ) .
When T cells were stimulated , p50 homodimer , p65 ( ReIA ) -p50 heterodimer and p65 ( ReIA ) homodimer complexes formed , which appeared as doublet bands .
The p50 homodimers constitute the faster migrating band , and the slower , upper band is composed of p50-p65 heterodimers ( Fig .
4 ) or p65 homodimers , as determined by the addition of specific Abs to the binding reaction .
Anti-p50 Ab disrupted the presence of the lower band and led to the appearance of a new slower migrating band , which is consistent with the shifted larger complex .
Anti-p65 Ab specifically eliminates the presence of the upper band because the Ab that binds this subunit 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology A ) E0 g 3 % ; 20 9 §§ | 5 Ss §§ & 44 1685 B ) Normal SLE9 Normal SLE12 SLE11 PMA/AZM87 | ~ = 0 + O+ o- -~ 0 t O+ PMA/ comp - - -o +00 - # 0 to * -o * _ A2ZM187 co +o ot ot c o* t \i W - » e l `` ' ~ - Clad a “ C Normal RA SLE PMA/Ca++ = .

- Stimulation of NF- « B in lymphocyte with PMA/A23187 .
A , Comparable levels of NF-KB can be induced by stimulation with either anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs or PMA/A23187 in normal lymphocytes .
Cells were induced with the designated agents for 6 h , and nuclear extracts were prepared .
EMSA was performed by incubating 1 pg of nuclear extracts with « B-labeled probe .
The specific NF- « B complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 0.5 % TBE PAGE .
B , Extracts from SLE T cells stimulated with PMA/A23187 for 6 h were analyzed for xB binding activity in EMSA .
EMSA experiment from normal T cells is shown for comparison .
C , NF- « B binding activity in extracts from T cells stimulated for 6 h with either antiCD3/anti-CD28 mAb or PMA/A23187 .
Both methods of stimulating T cells yielded similar levels of NF-KB activation as measured by EMSA .
is incompatible with DNA binding in EMSA .
Other members that constitute NF-KB activity , such as p52 and RelB , are predominantly expressed in accessory cells , such as dendritic cells and macrophages , and , as shown in Fig .
4 , these proteins were not detected in nuclear extracts from normal T cells using subunit-specific Abs .
FIGURE 3 .

B , Graph of relative absorbance of the band corresponding to p65 is shown to contrast the difference in activation of NF-KB .
To determine whether a particular NF- « B subunit was abnormally regulated in SLE , specific Abs for NF- « B subunits were added to the binding reaction in EMSA .
Similar to unstimulated T cells from normal individuals , the p50 component of NF- « B was supershifted in the presence of anti-p50 Ab .

Determination of NF- « B subunits present in DNA binding complexes in T cells from A ) normal individuals and SLE patients .
A , Equal amounts of extracts from unstimulated and stimu- lated ( anti-CD3/anti-CD28 ) normal T cells were in cubated with specified Ab ( 0.5 ug ) as described , ex cept for the second lane where 100X excess unlabeled kB oligonucleotide was added to the reac- tion .
Supershifted band ( 1 ) is present when anti-p50 Ab was added to the EMSA reaction .
Reduction of faster migrating band ( 3 ) is seen concomitantly .
An ti-p65 disrupts the middle band ( 2 ) .
Other Abs did not alter the pattern .
B , Extracts from stimulated and B ) unstimulated ( anti-CD3/anti-CD28 ) T cells from SLE patient that lack the slower migrating kB band .
Specific Abs ( 0.5 ug ) were added as indicated .
Only the anti-p50 Abs disrupted the binding pattern in both unstimulated and stimulated T cells by the appearance of band 1 and decrease in band 3 .
Normal SLE4 activity was found in SLE T cells when analyzed with anti-p65 Ab ( Fig .
4 ) .
The Abs specific for the other NF- « B members failed to alter the NF-KB binding pattern in lupus cells , which is consistent with their absence in the NF- « B binding activity in normal and lupus cells .
Defect in NF- « B binding activity is due to decreased p65 protein The lack of p65 DNA binding activity in EMSA assays in SLE T cells could reflect modifications of the p65 subunit that affect its ability to dimerize with other family members and bind DNA .
Alternatively , it is possible that the p65 protein may exist in an inactive form and is either unable to bind DNA or is inhibited by a repressor .
To distinguish among these possibilities , immunoblotting of whole lymphocyte proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was performed using Abs specific to p50 and p65 .
Fig .
5A demonstrates that the level of p50 in extracts from SLE T cells did not vary from one patient to another and was quantitatively comparable to extracts from normal and RA controls .
In addition , the level of p50 in each individual did not change after stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs or PMA/A23187 .
Next , we determined the amounts of p65 subunit by immuno-blotting .
We found that this subunit was absent in T cells from SLE patients with undetectable p65 DNA binding activity ( SLE4 and SLE19 , Fig .
5B ) .
Similarly , the p65 levels were markedly decreased in SLE individuals ( SLE12 and SLE14 ) with decreased DNA binding activity .
In contrast , the intensity of p65 band in RA patients was quantitatively comparable to that of normal controls .
Using protein extracts from the same patients and controls , we reassessed the levels of p65 with another anti-p65 Ab that recognizes the C terminus of the protein ( Fig .
5C ) .
We again noted the absence of the p65 protein in SLE T cells that lack DNA binding activity .
These results suggest that there is an abnormality in the expression of the p65 subunit in SLE patients and that it is associated with decreased/absent NF- « B binding activity .
In contrast , p65 protein was detected in lysates from PBMC from SLE patients , suggesting that the defect was limited to T cells ( data not shown ) .
Levels of NF- « B binding activity in SLE patients remain stable over time To determine whether the lack of NF- « B activity in lupus patients is a transient abnormality or is stable property , protein extracts 2— 3 - qu “ Buuﬁl NF- « B ABNORMALITIES IN HUMAN SLE Unstimulated Stimulated a wo s % © o c % a o f 8 § % & 5 a R 8 § $ 2 5 ee wn gong mom game : mmm yom : rm mmm C1 C £ Milk § % idd 41.8 ; E oaowmﬁ ‘ l ’ ( 9° a- m- % o g $ % b € $ 9 se $ b b Gb $ g g : ® °-.. , ,'- nv-l. -- - W bo bibb from the same individuals were obtained at different times , and the p50/p65 NF- « B binding activity was quantified .
The time intervals between the initial and subsequent analysis of NF- « B in each SLE patient varied from 1 to 15 mo .
As shown in Fig .
6 , the NF- « B binding activity remained stable over time and never approached the level exhibited by normal individuals .
The level of NF- « B activity over time remained significantly lower than the average of the level of normals ( p < 0.005 ) ( Fig .
6 ) .
Distribution of decreased level of p65 activity in SLE To assess the relative defect in the level of NF-B in the group of SLE patients tested in comparison to normal volunteers and RA patients and to eliminate interexperimental variation , all extract samples were assayed simultaneously under identical EMSA conditions using labeled « B probes .
The level of p65 induction was scanned from the autoradiographic films that were subjected to the same length of exposure .
Fig .
7 shows the relative distribution of the level of p65 from individuals after either stimulation using surface stimulation with antiCD3¥/antiCD28 mAbs or PMA/ A23187 .
The distribution clearly shows that normal controls always show inducible NF- « B activity that falls into a distinguishable level from that seen for the SLE group .
The SLE group showed a level that extends from undetectable to normal .
The mean level of activity in SLE patients was statistically lower than that of the normal individuals ( p < 0.0001 ) .
RA patients exhibited levels of NF- « B induction that overlapped with those of normal individuals , albeit in the low range .
The mean level of NF-KB from the RA group was statistically lower than that of normal individuals ( p = 0.001 ) and statistically higher than that of SLE patients ( p = 0.01 ) .
NF-KB activity and clinical variables of disease activity The group of SLE patients studied was comprised of 22 individuals with SLE disease activity index ( SLEDAT ) levels that ranged from 0 to 32 .
Of the SLE patients , 2 had NF-KB levels within 1 SD of normal , 10 had NF- « B levels between 1 and 2 SD , and 10 had SD > 2 SD of the normal mean ( Table I ) .
We analyzed the level of NF- « B activity with respect to SLEDAI by regression analysis and found that there was no correlation between SLEDAI and p65 level .
Since corticosteroids can suppress NF- « B activity by increasing the level of IB ( 36 , 37 ) , it was important to determine whether steroids and/or other drugs used in the treatment of lupus were correlated with the observed defect in NF-KB binding ( Table II ) .

impaired T cell proliferation and NK cytotoxicity ( 14 , 15 ) .
This report focuses on the regulation of the transcription factor NF- « B because it plays an integral role in the regulation of IL-2 .
The results described here represent the first focused analysis of the regulation of NF-KB in SLE T cells .
The data presented identifies a defect in nuclear signaling in T cells isolated from patients with SLE .
We found that freshly isolated SLE T cells showed a TCR-mediated defect in the activation of NE- « B .
This defect was also present when cells were analyzed following stimulation with PMA/A23187 , which bypasses mem-brane-associated signaling pathways .
Abs specific for members of the NF-KB family showed that the defect is from a lack of the p65 RelA subunit .
In primary T cells , we found that the predominant NF- « B subunits are p50 and p65 .
The levels of p50 , as analyzed by immunoblots , were similar in T cells from normal controls , RA controls , and SLE patients , indicating that not all NF- « B/Rel components are abnormal and the defect of p65SReIA accounts for the 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 1688 P < 0.0001 300 7 f—ﬁ P < 0.01 ( O N aoe 250 7 be LJ 200 | p65 level ( relative absorbance ) * s & 150 7 143 pe e * bs 100 7 4 A % A ‘ €£644 e | A @ 50 s ® A e `` 133.5 - 5 Normal RA SLE N=17 N=8 N=22 FIGURE 7 .

abnormal NF- « B binding activity seen in SLE T cells .
Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the p65 subunit was undetectable in the distinct group of patients who had undetectable NF- « B binding activity on EMSA .
The absence of p65 protein was confirmed using Abs against two distinct regions of the protein , indicating that defective expression was not due to a loss or modification of a specific epitope .
The immunoblot analysis also excludes a sequestration of p65 in an inactive form by the inhibitor IkKB as a basis for the decreased activity in SLE T cells .
These findings suggest that patients with SLE have abnormalities in the signaling pathway at the nuclear level .
Although altered p65 NF-KB activity could reflect aberrant early TCR-mediated signaling ( 4 ) , the lack of p65 NF- « B activation following stimulation with PMA/A23187 argues for a specific defect in NF-KB regulation independent of TCR Z-chain abnormality .
Furthermore , because Z-deficient T cell clones are partially competent in the induction of signal and can induce the expression of IL-2 ( 38 ) , absence of the Z-chain alone can not fully account for the defective activation of p65 in some patients.Since primary T cells require NF-KB to fully express the IL-2 gene , the defect in NF-kB Table I .

* Normal mean OD = 143 ; 1SD = 62. in SLE patients is consistent with the previously described defect in the expression of IL-2 .
In the patients examined in this study , the abnormality of NF-KB did not correlate with disease activity .
The consistent inducibility of the p65 NF-KB in T cells from RA patients , as opposed to that seen for SLE patients , suggests that the pathologic mechanism for NF-KB regulation differs between these two autoimmune diseases .
A lack of NF- « B activity , particularly the function provided by the p65 subunit that contributes the transcriptional activating portion of the DNA binding complex ( 39 ) , provides a mechanism for a defect in IL-2 expression .
Furthermore , in the absence of p65 in lupus T cells , the remaining p50 can form homodimers , bind DNA , and repress gene expression ( 39 , 40 ) .
Indeed , p50 homodimers can be found in anergic T cells that fail to produce IL-2 ( 41 ) .
Therefore , both the presence of p50 homodimers and the lack of p65 are consistent with the reported decreased IL-2 production in SLE T cells .
NE- « B activity is present in almost all cells , and different members of the protein family are expressed in different tissues ( 42 ) .
Although many members contribute to NF- « B function , the requirement for multiple members is not clear , but one could speculate that specificity and tissue-specific control of gene expression is achieved through assembling unique combinations of the different members .
Genetic approaches in mice have been undertaken where specific NF- « B genes were disrupted through a knockout approach to determine the ability of the animal to survive and develop .
Although a lack of RelA leads to embryonic death at day 16 with extensive apoptosis in the liver ( 43 ) , absence of the smaller p50 subunit is compatible with life ( 44 ) .
The role of steroids in the observed decrease in NF-KB binding activity can be ruled out on the basis of two findings .
First , RA patients who were on steroids displayed normal level of NF-kB activity .
Second , NF-KB activity was absent in patients who were off steroids .
This finding is not surprising in light of the fact that steroids may actually increase the amount of inactive NF-KB , as IB synthesis is increased to retain NF-KB in the cytoplasm in an inactive state to prevent nuclear translocation ( 37 ) .
If steroids had a significant effect , then immunoblot analysis would reveal either a normal level of p65 or even a greater protein level .
However , this finding was not observed .
The extent to which NF- « B is altered in systemic rheumatic diseases is unknown .
In this communication , we report severely depressed NF-KB activity in SLE T cells and moderately decreased activity in T cells from RA patients .
More studies are needed to define the magnitude and the prevalence of this abnormality in rheumatic diseases .
Although NF-B is important in the transcription of many genes that are involved in the immune response , including IL-2 , it is difficult at present to stipulate the degree to 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology which its deficiency is responsible for the manifold immune aberrations that characterize lupus .
Along this line , it should be considered that the regulation of NF-KB activity is complex and involves the contribution from many family member proteins in various cell types .
Lessons learned from knockout mice may not directly help in understanding the role of decreased NF-KB activity in the immunopathogenesis of human disease .
For example , a lack of RelB , although it does not cause embryonic lethality , is associated with multiorgan inflammation ( 32 ) .
In a similar context , IL-2-deficient mice , in contrast to what one may expect on the basis of the in vitro function of IL-2 , develop a severe multisys-temic inflammatory disease ( 45 , 46 ) .
Apparently , the complexity of the immune system does not permit direct extrapolation from murine models to human disease .
Therefore , further studies are needed to investigate the function of NF- « B in human systemic autoimmune diseases and , specifically , how its defect contributes to decreased IL-2 production .
