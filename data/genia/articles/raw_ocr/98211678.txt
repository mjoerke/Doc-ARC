* HIV-1 infection is accompanied by qualitative and quantitative defects in CD4 * T lymphocytes .
Loss of immune function in HIV patients is usually associated with a profound dysregu-lation of cytokine production .
To investigate whether cytokine signaling defects occur during HIV infection , PHA blasts from healthy human donors were infected with two strains of HIV-1 and screened for the expression of STAT proteins used in cytokine signaling .
A selective decrease in STAT5B was seen 8 days after infection with the BZ167 dual-tropic HIV isolate , but not with the Ba-L , M-tropic strain .
Based on these findings , purified T cells from HIV-infected patients in different stages of disease were also tested for STAT expression ; decreases in STAT5A , STAT5B , and STAT1 a were observed in all patients .
The reduction in STATs seen in vivo and in vitro after HIV infection may contribute to the loss of T cell function in HIV disease .

IV infection is associated with a progressive immune H suppression , characterized by an early impairment of CD4* T cell function and a later decline in absolute CD4 * T cell number ( 1 , 2 ) .
Several recent studies have focused on the disruption of signaling pathways in T cells as possible causes for HIV-induced immune dysfunction ; HIV-related alterations in src family protein tyrosine kinases ( 3-7 ) , CD45 phosphatase ( 8 ) , protein kinase C ( 9 ) , intracellular Ca** ( 9 ) , and ERK-2 and JNK kinases ( 10 ) have all been observed .
Although it is not known whether these defects relate to the syndrome of HIV disease , it is *Experimental Immunology Branch , National Cancer Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ; *Intramural Research Support Program-Scientific Applications International Corporation , Frederick , Laboratory of Molecular Im-munoregulation , National Cancer Institute , Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , MD ; *HIV Unit , Wilford Hall Medical Center , Lackland Air Force Base , TX .

A second factor that could account for the impairment of immune function in HIV-infected individuals is the profound alteration in cytokine secretion patterns seen in vivo and in vitro after HIV infection ( 11-13 ) .
The cytokines that a cell secretes typically depend upon the signals it receives from other cytokines in the medium .
Most cytokines transduce biologic signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway ( 14-16 ) .
JAK kinases constitutively associate with the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors , and ligation with cytokine leads to JAK activation .
STAT transcription factors are recruited to the activated cytokine receptor-JAK kinase complex where they are tyrosine phosphorylated .
The phosphorylated STAT 's then translocate to the nucleus where they promote transcription of genes that control cell growth , differentiation , and maintenance of cellular homeostasis .
Seven STAT genes , STATs 1-4 , two closely related isoforms of STAT5 , A and B , and STAT6 have been identified to date ( 16 , 17 ) .
Of all the STATs , STATS is used most extensively in the signaling pathways of immunologi-cally relevant cytokines , including IL-2 , -3 , -5 , -7 , -9 , -15 , and granulocyte-macrophage ( GM ) -CSF ( 18 ) .
Recently , we demonstrated that STATS5SA and STATSB protein and message were strongly depressed in tumor-bearing mice , while the expression of other members of the STAT family were unaltered ( 19 ) .
The selective reduction of STATS was associated with a loss in T and B cell function , suggesting that the STATS signaling pathway might play a crucial role in the tumor-dependent immunodeficiency .
These observations raised the possibility that STAT down-regulation might also occur in other immunosuppressive conditions .
Therefore , in the current report we studied the expression of STAT proteins in T cells from normal donors following in vitro infection with HIV-1 and in T cells from HIV-infected patients .
We show that in vitro HIV-1 infection can directly induce a selective down-modulation of STAT5B and that T cells from HIV-infected individuals have decreased expression of both STATSA and -B .
Materials and Methods Cells PBMC were prepared from buffy coats from normal National Institutes of Health Blood Bank donors by Ficoll/Hypaque separation ( 20 ) .
PBL from HIV-infected patients were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque separation and plastic adherence ( 21 ) .
CD3 * T cells were enriched from PBL by negative selection using a mAb mixture plus complement ( Lymphokwik , One 0022-1 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; The Journal of Immunology WR -~ Wege ) -~ AUK -~ wt wo » `` , -o- STATSA Mu ( R -m HIV-1 : _- + == + Day 3 Day 8 FIGURE 1 .

Cell-free supernatants were titered for p24 core Ag by ELISA ( AIDS Vaccine Program , NCI , Frederick , MD ) .
HIV infection PBMC ( 2 X 10¢/ml ) were stimulated with 2 ug/ml PHA ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) for 3 days at 37°C , and washed twice .
PHA blasts ( 10 '' /sample ) were incubated for 2 h with HIV-1§7 ; ,4 , or HIV-14 , , , ( 172 and 570 tissue culture IDs , , respectively ) and washed three times .
Infected cells ( 1 X 10°/ml ) were incubated 3 or 8 days in medium supplemented with 10 U/ml of recombinant IL-2 ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Medium in the 8-day cultures was replaced 4 days after infection .
HIV-1 infection was followed by ELISA for HIV-1 p24 .
Immunoprecipitations The immunoprecipitation procedure has been described previously ( 19 ) .
Briefly , 5 X 10° cells/group were incubated for 1 h at 4°C in Triton X-100 ( 1 % ) lysing buffer and spun .
Supernatants were incubated with anti-STAT polyclonal Ab and adsorbed with protein A-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Adsorbed proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on a 7.5 % homogeneous PhastGel ( Pharmacia ) followed by Western blotting with the same Ab used for immunoprecipitation .
Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence .
Results In vitro HIV-1 infection reduces STATS expression We previously showed that immunosuppression in tumor bearing mice was accompanied by a loss in STATS expression ( 19 ) .
To determine whether HIV infection would elicit a similar effect , PHA blasts from healthy , HIV-negative donors were infected with the primary HIV-1 isolate , BZ167 , and STAT expression was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting 3 and 8 days after infection ( Fig .
1 ) .
By day 8 , when viral replication was well advanced ( Table I ) , STAT5B expression was strikingly reduced .
By contrast , STAT 's 1 , 2 , 3 and 5A were not significantly altered .

Each sample represents a separate experiment using cells from a different donor .
No loss in STATS5B was observed 3 days after infection when viral replication was significantly less , indicating that STAT5B modulation occurred late in the infection cycle .
Because gp120 and tat proteins have been found to affect immune function ( 24-27 ) , we tested whether culturing PHA blasts with either of these HIV-1 proteins would alter STATSA or B expression .
A mixture of recombinant gp120 and tat had no effect on STATSA or B expres-sion , and similar negative results were obtained when the cells were cultured for 3 or 8 days with either tat or gp120 alone ( data not shown ) .
Preferential down-regulation of STAT5B by HIV-1 The capacity of the dual-tropic HIV-1 strain BZ167 to down-mod-ulate STATS5B was compared with that of the M-tropic strain Ba-L. HIV-l1py47 isolate ( Fig .
24 ) , which uses predominantly CXCR4 and CCR3 coreceptors ( D. Cohen , unpublished observa-tion ) , markedly decreased STATS5B expression but had no effect on STAT1 or STATS5A , consistent with the results presented above .
By contrast , the Ba-L M-tropic HIV-1 strain ( Fig .
2B ) , which uses primarily CCR5 as coreceptor ( 28 ) , had little effect on the expression of any of the three STATs examined .
HIV-1py457 was significantly more virulent than HIV-1 » , , , , ( Table I ) , suggesting that the difference between the two strains in blocking STATS5B expression was due to differences in their abilities to infect the cells .
STAT5A and -B are reduced in T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals The capacity of HIV-ly ; 47 to decrease STAT5B expression in infected PHA blasts raised the possibility that STAT levels might also be reduced in the T cells of HIV-1-infected donors .
Purified T cells from 5 HIV-positive patients exhibiting a range of CD4 counts ( Table II ) were examined for the levels of expression of STATS proteins .
As seen in Figure 3 , both STATSA and STATS5B were markedly reduced in all 5 of the HIV-positive patients ( P1 through P5 ) , as compared with 2 HIV-negative ( N1 and N2 ) control donors studied simultaneously .
By contrast , STAT3 , STAT6 , and the lower m.w .
splice variant of STAT1 ( STAT1B ) showed near normal levels of protein expression in all donors .
Interest-ingly , the higher m.w .
variant , STAT1 « , appeared to be absent in the cells from the infected patients .
No quantitative correlation between the reduction in STAT protein and either the stage of the disease or therapy was observed in this small group of patients .
Further studies in an extended group of patients will be necessary to elucidate the relationship between clinical characteristics and alteration in STAT expression .
Reduced expression of STATS5A , STAT5B , and STAT1a in patients ' T cells differed from in vitro HIV-1-infected cultures in which the reduction was limited to STAT5B .

by a marked decrease in the expression STAT5 , a transcription factor used in the transduction of intracellular signals by a wide variety of cytokine receptors ( 14 ) .
In vitro infection of PHA blasts from HIV-negative donors with the dual-tropic HIV-1 strain BZ167 induced a selective loss of STAT5B protein .
The specificity of this response was striking because it was not observed with any of the other STAT proteins examined , including the highly homol-ogous STATSA isoform ( Fig .
14 ) .
The loss in STATS5B protein may have been due to a decrease in its rate of synthesis or an increase in its degradation rate , but it was not due to its translo-cation to the nucleus since the lysis conditions used in our experiments released both cytoplasmic and nuclear STAT 's .
In addition , the down-regulation of STATS5B was observed only late after infection with the BZ167 strain , and in cultures that were producing a high amount of virus , as measured by p24 release ( Fig .
1 , Table I ) .
Infection of PHA blasts with the M-tropic strain ; , failed to decrease STATS5B ( Fig .

infection was much lower with this isolate than with ( Table I ) .
Most sexual transmissions of HIV-1 are caused by M-tropic viruses ( 29 , 30 ) ; therefore , the down-regulation of STATSB associated with the direct infection of T cells would likely occur in infected individuals only after the virus evolved in vivo into a T-tropic form .
The decrease in STATS5 and STAT1a expression in purified T cells from HIV infected patients was remarkable because it occurred in all five patients examined ( Fig .
3 ) , although these patients differed with respect to their disease stages and CD4 * T cell counts ( Table II ) .
In contrast to in vitro infection of PHA blasts , STATS5A , STATS5B and STAT1a were all reduced in patients ' T cells .
The loss of these STATs was selective because no consistent change was detected in the expression of STAT1B , STAT3 , and STAT6 .
Our preliminary finding that STAT1 « but not - is lost in HIV * patients could have profound immunologic consequences because the a and B forms of STAT1 are splice variants , with STAT1B acting as a dominant negative .
Thus the loss of the a form of STAT1 could lead to abrogation of STAT1 function , which in deficient mice produces impaired innate immunity to viral infections ( 15 ) .
Since most peripheral blood T cells are not infected in HIV * patients ( 31 ) , it is unlikely that the loss in STATS and STAT1a seen in lysates from patients ' T cells was due to a direct effect of the virus on STAT expression .
A more likely mechanism is that HIV-1 induced the secretion of one or more factors that resulted in STAT down-regulation .
Decreased STATS expression has now been observed in two unrelated diseases that cause immunosuppression , HIV disease in humans and experimentally induced mammary carcinoma in mice ( 19 ) .
The role that STATS plays in the impairment of immune function in these diseases is not known .
However , because STATS has a broad spectrum of cytokine usage , its loss would be expected to strongly influence the immune system .
The present study is the first to suggest that regulation of STATS5 may be involved in modulating cytokine profiles and immune function in HIV-infected patients .
This study , as well as the previous report demonstrating STATS5 decreases in tumor-bearing mice ( 19 ) , suggests that the regulation of STAT signaling pathways may provide a molecular mechanism that the immune system uses to control its level of activity .
