However , little is known about the transcription factors that regulate its expression .
Here , we show that Jagged1 is a Rel/ NF-KB-responsive gene .
Both c-Rel and RelA induced jagged1 gene expression , whereas a mutant defective for transactivation did not .
Importantly , jagged1 transcripts were also upregulated by endogenous NF-KB activation and this effect was inhibited by a dominant mutant of IxBa , a physiological inhibitor of NF-KB .
Cell surface expression of Jagged1 in c-Rel-expressing cell monolayers led to a functional interaction with lymphocytes expressing the Notch1/TAN-1 receptor .
This correlated with the initiation of signaling downstream of Notch , as evidenced by increased levels of HES-1 transcripts in co-cultivated T cells and of CD23 transcripts in co-cultivated B cells .
Consistent with its ReI/NF-KB-dependent induction , Jagged1 was found to be highly expressed in splenic B cells where c-Rel is expressed constitutively .
These results demonstrate that c-Rel can trigger the Notch signaling pathway in neighboring cells by inducing jagged ] gene expression , and suggest a role for Jagged1 in B-cell activation , differentiation or function .
These findings also highlight the potential for an interplay between the Notch and NF-KB signaling pathways in the immune system .
Keywords : Jagged1/NF- « xB/Notch/Rel/TAN-1 Introduction The Rel/NF-KB transcription factors play fundamental roles in the immune system .
These structurally related proteins share common pathways of activation that involve their release from inhibitory IKB factors in response to stimuli ( reviewed in Whiteside and Israel , © European Molecular Biology Organization 1997 ) .
The degradation of IKB results in the nuclear translocation of active Rel dimers , their binding to KB DNA sites and the activation of cellular gene expression ( reviewed in Baldwin , 1996 ) .
NF-KB regulates the expression of various cytokines , chemokines , immuno-receptors , growth factors , acute phase proteins and adhesion molecules ( reviewed in Kopp and Ghosh , 1995 ; May and Ghosh , 1997 ) .
It is therefore not surprising to find its implication in the immune , inflammatory and acute phase responses ( reviewed in Wulezyn et al. , 1996 ; Barnes and Karin , 1997 ) .
The Notch gene family encodes transmembrane receptors that control cell proliferation and differentiation in response to extracellular ligands expressed on neighboring cells ( reviewed in Robey , 1997 ; Weinmaster , 1997 ) .
Among the four mammalian Notch receptors identified to date , three of them are expressed in hematopoietic cells .
Human NotckI/IZAN-1 and its murine counterpart are found in spleen , CD34¢ hematopoietic stems cells and early progenitor cells , thymic T cells , peripheral blood lymphocytes and a B-lymphoma cell line ( Ellisen et al. , 1991 ; Milner et al. , 1994 ; Hasserjian et al. , 1996 ) .
Similarly , Notch2 is highly expressed in spleen , and both Notch2 and Notch 3 are found in hematopoietic and myeloid progenitor cell lines ( Weinmaster et al. , 1992 ; Milner et al. , 1996 ; Bigas et al. , 1998 ) .
Notchl was isolated originally as a translocation in a human acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma , and its constitutively active form produces T-cell neoplasms in mice ( Ellisen et al. , 1991 ; Pear et al. , 1996 ) .
Two other Notch genes also map to chromosomal locations associated with human immune system malignancies ( Larsson et al. , 1994 ; reviewed in Gridley , 1997 ) .
Jagged1 , Jagged2 , Deltal and Delta2 belong to the DSL ( Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 ) family of ligands for mammalian Notch receptors ( reviewed in Weinmaster , 1997 ) .
All are transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain important for receptor binding .
Ligand-mediated activation of Notch induces the proteolytic release of the intracellular domain of Notch , activation of cellular gene expression and suppression of differentiation ( Schroeter et al. , 1998 ; reviewed in Robey , 1997 ; Weinmaster , 1997 ; Bray , 1998 ; Chan and Jan , 1998 ) .
Studies point to the CSL [ CBF1/ Su ( H ) /Lag-1/RBP-JK/KBF2 ] family of DNA-binding proteins as downstream effectors in this pathway ( Brou et al. , 1994 ; Dou et al. , 1994 ; Fortini and Artavanis-Tsakonas , 1994 ; Jarriault et al. , 1995 ; Tamura et al. , 1995 ; Hsieh et al. , 1996 ) .
In the nucleus , CSL factors serve as docking proteins that direct the intracellular domain of activated Notch to the promoter of target genes ( Jarriault et al. , 1995 ; Hsich et al. , 1996 ; Kopan et al. , 1996 ; Schroeter et al. , 1998 ; reviewed in Bray , 1998 ; Chan and Jan , 1998 ) .
The mammalian basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factor Hairy Enhancer of Split 2803 J.Bash et al .
( HES-1 ) and the B-cell activation marker CD23 are two cellular target genes directly regulated by this pathway ( Wang et al. , 1987 , 1991 ; Cordier et al. , 1990 ; Sasai et al. , 1992 ; Ling et al. , 1994 ; Bailey and Posakony , 1995 ; Jarriault et al. , 1995 , 1998 ; Lecourtois and Schweisguth , 1995 ; de la Pompa et al. , 1997 ) .
Little is known of the factors that trigger ligand-mediated signaling upstream of Notch .
In this report , we identified jagged ] as a novel Rel/ NF-KB-responsive gene .
We show that jagged !
gene expression can be induced specifically by transcription-ally competent NF-KB subunits and that it is suppressed by a super-IKB @ inhibitor ( IKBGAN ) .
Our finding that NF-KB-mediated induction of Jagged1 can initiate signaling downstream of Notch correlates with the expression of Jagged1 in peripheral lymphoid tissues .
These results suggest a direct interplay of the Notch and NF-KB signaling pathways in the immune system , both of which have been implicated in lymphoid cell proliferation and function .
Results Ectopic Rel protein expression induces fagged1 transcripts The CCR43 cell line conditionally expresses c-Rel under the control of a tetracycline-regulated transactivator ( tTA ) , resulting in inducible transactivation of Rel target genes such as IxB & ( Bash et al. , 1997 ) .
An mRNA differential display analysis identified a 106 bp cDNA fragment that was induced specifically in CCR43 cells expressing c-Rel .
When used as a probe in Northern blots , this fragment hybridized to a 5.8 kb transcript induced in response to c-Rel expression in CCR43 cells ( data not shown ) .
A complete cDNA was isolated from a human HeLa cell library ( clone 14-6 ; 5457 bp ) .
This clone showed 90 % homology to rat jagged1l and was virtually identical to two human jagged !
cDNA clones that were isolated recently ( Lindsell et al. , 1995 ; Oda et al. , 1997 ; Li et al. , 1998 ) .
Clone 14-6 contained a 3657 bp open reading frame encoding a 1218 amino acid human Jagged1 protein , along with 263 bp of 5'-untranslated sequence and 1537 bp of 3'-untranslated sequence ( DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No .
AFO28593 ) .
Two amino acid differences were found between the Jagged1 protein sequence reported by Oda et al .
( 1997 ) and the sequence described by us and by Li et al .
( 1998 ) .
The differential expression of jagged ] was characterized further by Northern blot analysis of CCR43 cells during a time course of c-Rel induction , using the jagged ] cDNA as a probe ( Figure 1A ) .
jagged ] transcripts were induced with kinetics that paralleled those for c-re/ and for the Rel/NF-KB target gene encoding ( lanes 10-18 ) .
No induction was seen in the parental HtTA-1 cells that expressed the tTA activator alone ( lanes 1-9 ) , indicating that jagged ] is under c-Rel control .
The transactivation of jagged ] was specific , as endogenous transcripts for the ligand Deltal and for the Notch1/TAN-1 receptor were unaffected ( Figure 1B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Importantly , a cell line expressing a mutant c-Rel protein deleted of its transactivation domain ( denoted CCR-H5 ) failed to upregulate jagged ] transcripts ( Figure 1B , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Similar results were observed with cells expressing 2804 p50/NF-KB1 , a subunit of NF-KB that fails to activate gene expression from most promoters containing a KB DNA site ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , jagged ] transcripts were induced in HtTA-RelA cells that conditionally expressed the RelA transactivating subunit of NF-KB , although some leaky expression of was observed in these cells in the presence of tetracycline ( Figure 1C , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Together , these results indicated that the transcriptional activity of c-Rel and RelA was necessary to activate jagged ] gene expression .
Jjagged1 gene expression is dependent upon endogenous NF-xB activation To investigate further the functional linkage between Jagged ] and ReI/NF-KB factors , we monitored the effect of endogenous NF-KB activation on jagged ] gene expression .
Human Jurkat T cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) plus ionomycin to activate endogenous NF-KB factors .
This treatment led to a 4-fold increase in jagged ] mRNA levels in comparison with unstimulated cells ( Figure 1D , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Similar results were obtained in human CEM T cells ( data not shown ) .
Importantly , the constitutive repression of endogenous NF-KB by a dominant mutant of IBG in Jurkat T cells interfered strongly with the induction of Jagged ] in response to PMA plus ionomycin ( Figure 1D , lanes 3 and 4 ; Boothby et al. , 1997 ; Chu et al. , 1997 ) .
Rehybridization to an interleukin-2 receptor alpha ( IL-2RQ ) probe confirmed the activation of NF-KB in Jurkat T cells treated with PMA plus ionomycin , and the reduction in NF-KB activation in Jurkat-IKBOAN cells ( Figure 1D , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
These results agreed with our findings in the CCR43 and HtTA-RelA cell lines and indicated that the expression of jaggedl was dependent on Rel/NF-KB activity .
Cell surface expression of Jagged1 promotes cell-cell interactions The expression of c-Rel led to increased levels of Jagged 1 protein in CCR43 cells .
Immunoblot analyses using a monoclonal antibody specific for the unique intracellular domain of human Jagged1 ( Ab # TS1 ) showed the accumulation of Jagged1 in response to c-Rel induction ( Figure 2A , lanes 1-5 ) .
Immunofluorescence analysis of live non-permeabilized cells using an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of Jagged1 verified the localization of the protein at the surface of CCR43 cells expressing c-Rel ( Figure 2B , panel c ) .
In contrast , only background staining was detected in CCR43 cells cultured in the presence of tetracycline to prevent c-Rel expression ( panel b ) .
Taken together , these results indicated the accumulation of the Jagged1 protein at the cell surface in response to c-Rel expression .
The Notch signaling pathway is triggered by the interaction of cells expressing Notch receptors with cells that express Notch ligands at their surface .
We tested whether the Rel-dependent induction of Jagged1 in CCR43 cells could promote a functional interaction with cells expressing endogenous Notch1l/TAN-1 receptors in co-cultivation assays .
As shown in Figure 3A , non-adherent human Jurkat T cells that expressed a wild-type TAN-1 gene aggregated onto a monolayer of CCR43 cells induced to express c-Rel ( panel b ) .

RNA from control HtTA-1 cells ( lanes 1-9 ) and CCR43 cells ( lanes 10-18 ) maintained in the presence ( lanes 1 and 10 ) or absence ( Janes 2-9 and 11-18 ) of tetracycline , was analyzed using human jagged ) cDNA clone A2-3 as a probe .
The blot was rehybridized successively to control c-rel , IxBa and actin gene probes .
( B ) Comparative Northern blot analysis of jagged1 , deltal and Notch1/IAN-1 transcripts in cells expressing wild-type c-Rel or a mutant c-Rel protein deleted of its transactivation domain .
CCR43 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and CCR-H5 cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) were cultured in the presence ( lanes 1 and 3 ) or absence ( lanes 2 and 4 ) of tetracycline .
Expression was analyzed with probes derived from the human jagged ] cDNA clone A2-3 , a rat deltal cDNA and a human NotchI/TAN-1 cDNA fragment .

Rehybridization to actin was used as a control .
( D ) Induction of jagged ) gene expression in response to endogenous NF-KB activation in T cells .
Jurkat T cells and a Jurkat T-cell clone that expressed a dominant IKBGAN inhibitor of Rel/NF-KB factors were left untreated ( lanes 1 and 3 ) , or were stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin for 2 h to activate endogenous NF-KB factors ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
Total cellular RNA ( 20 ug ) was analyzed for the expression of jagged ] transcripts in Northern blots .
The blot was rehybridized successively to II-2R « and gapdh probes as controls .
within 2 h of co-cultivation .
Whereas gentle washings failed to disrupt the cell aggregates that formed on c-Rel-expressing cell monolayers , few T cells remained attached to CCR43 cells that were not induced to express c-Rel ( Figure 3A , compare panels a and b ) .
No aggregation was observed when Jurkat T cells were cultivated with cell monolayers expressing a mutant c-Rel protein deleted of its transactivation domain ( CCR-H5 cells ) or with the parental HtTA-1 cells ( panels c and d ; data not shown ) .
These results agreed with our finding that the transcriptional activity of c-Rel was necessary to induce the expression of jagged1 .
Although the data suggested the interaction of Jagged1 and Notch proteins expressed at the surface of CCR43 and Jurkat T cells , respectively , it remained possible that cytokines or cell adhesion molecules induced by c-Rel could be responsible for the observed cell interactions .
We therefore investigated whether an intact Notch receptor was required for cell aggregation , by testing the ability of CCR43 cells to promote the aggregation of human Sup-TIl T cells .
Both Jurkat T cells and Sup-T1 T cells are derived from a human T-lymphoblastic leukemia .
While Jurkat T cells lack any known abnormality of chromosome 9 and express an intact Notch1l/TAN-1 receptor , Sup-TIl T cells contain two copies of a t ( 7 ; 9 ) ( q34 ; q34.3 ) translocation and have no normal Notch/ 2805 J.Bash et al .

Functional interaction between c-Rel-expressing cells and cells expressing endogenous Notch1/TAN-1 receptors .
( A ) Co-cultivation assay .
Non-adherent human Jurkat T cells ( a-d ) , Sup-T1 T cells ( e and £ ) , Reh pre-B cells ( g and h ) or U266 B cells ( i and j ) were co-cultivated onto adherent monolayers of uninduced ( a , c , e , g and i ) or induced ( b , d , f , h and j ) CCR43 cells ( a , b and e- ) , or CCR-H5 cells ( c and d ) for 48 h. After co-cultivation , the non-adherent cells were gently washed away and the cells that remained attached onto the cell monolayers were photographed .
In agreement with our previous studies showing a c-Rel-mediated growth arrest in CCR43 cells , the density of the induced CCR43 cell monolayers in panels b , f , h and j is lower than that in panels a , c , d , e , g and i .
( B ) Northern blot analysis of endogenous HES-I gene expression in Jurkat T cells ( lanes 1-4 ) or Sup-T1 T cells ( lanes 5 and 6 ) co-cultivated onto cell monolayers of uninduced or induced CCR43 cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , and uninduced or induced HtTA-jag10 cells ( lanes 3-6 ) .
The blot was rehybridized to a gapdh probe as a control .
( C ) Northern blot analysis of endogenous CD23 gene expression in human Reh pre-B cells cultivated onto a CCR43 cell monolayer uninduced ( lane 1 ) or induced to express c-Rel ( lane 2 ) .

The ( Ellisen et al. , 1991 ; Aster et al. , 1994 ) .
Consistent with mutant TAN-1 protein in Sup-T1 T cells therefore lacks this observation , the induction of c-Rel in CCR43 cells the extracellular domain necessary for ligand interaction failed to induce the aggregation of Sup-Tl T cells 2806 ( Figure 3A , panel f ) .
This is in sharp contrast to the cell aggregation that was observed with Jurkat T cells ( Figure 3A , panel b ) .
Similarly , human Reh pre-B cells that expressed high levels of endogenous NotchI/IAN-1 transcripts aggregated onto the CCR43 cell monolayer induced to express c-Rel .
In contrast , human U266 mature B cells that did not express any TAN-I failed to do so ( compare panels h and j ; Guan et al. , 1996 ; data not shown ) .
While it is possible that other factors may also contribute to these interactions , the results indicated that an intact Notch extracellular domain was necessary for the observed cell-cell interactions and suggested that c-Rel enabled a functional interaction between Jagged1 and Notch .
c-Rel leads to activation of the Notch signaling pathway Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of Notch initiates signaling downstream of the receptor .
The genes encoding the mammalian transcription factor HES-1 and the B-cell activation marker CD23 are two direct downstream targets of this signaling pathway ( Wang et al. , 1987 , 1991 ; Cordier et al. , 1990 ; Ling et al. , 1994 ; Bailey and Posakony , 1995 ; Jarriault et al. , 1995 , 1998 ; Lecourtois and Schweisguth , 1995 ) .
We examined whether the c-Rel-dependent induction of Jagged1 could trigger Notch signaling in neighboring cells by monitoring its effect on endogenous HES- ] and CD23 gene expression in co-cultivated T cells and B cells , respectively .
HES-I transcripts reproducibly were increased 2- to 3-fold in Jurkat T cells cultivated onto a monolayer of CCR43 cells expressing c-Rel in comparison with those cultivated with an uninduced CCR43 cell monolayer ( Figure 3B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Importantly , HES-1 transcripts were also induced in Jurkat T cells cultivated onto a HtTA-1-derived cell monolayer that expressed Jaggedl alone ( HtTA-Jag10 cells ; compare lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Rehybridization to a control gapdh probe confirmed the specificity of this induction .
As anticipated , high levels of HES-1 transcripts were observed in the control Sup-Tl T cells that express a truncated and constitutively active Notch-1/TAN-1 receptor ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
In agreement with these findings , the co-cultivation of human Reh pre-B cells with a CCR43 cell monolayer expressing c-Rel resulted in the induction of CD23 gene expression , in comparison with Reh cells cultivated onto an uninduced CCR43 cell monolayer ( Figure 3C ) .
Together , these data support a model whereby c-Rel can trigger Notch signaling in neighboring cells by inducing the expression of Jagged1 .
jagged1 is highly expressed in peripheral lymphoid organs and in splenic B cells The induction of jagged1 gene expression in response to endogenous Rel/NF-KB activation led us to examine its expression in immune tissues by Northern blot analysis .
High levels of jagged1 transcripts were found in human spleen and lymph nodes , in agreement with the high levels of c-rel transcripts in these tissues ( Figure 4A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Lower levels of jaggedl mRNAs were seen in human thymus , bone marrow and fetal liver ( lanes 3 , 5 and 6 ) .
No expression was detected in peripheral blood leukocytes ( PBL ; lane 4 ) .
Immunohistochemistry analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the intracellular domain of the factors induce Jagged1 expression Jagged1 protein was used to investigate its expression in adult mouse spleen .
Strong Jagged1 staining was confined to the B-cell areas of the spleen ( Figure 4B , panel a ) .
Positive cells were located mainly in the marginal zone .
A weaker signal was detected in the perifollicular zone , the periarterial sheath and the red pulp .
Jagged1 was found to co-localize with the B-cell antigen CD20 ( compare panels a and c ) .
In contrast , only background staining was observed with normal rat serum ( panel b ) and pre-immune mouse IgG ( panel d ) , which were used as negative controls .
Importantly , the distribution of Jagged1 in mouse spleen coincided with that previously reported for c-Rel ( Carrasco et al. , 1994 ) .
Immunofluorescence assays were performed on purified mouse splenic B cells to examine further the correlation between the expression of Jagged1 and c-Rel .
Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that spleen cells expressing the B-cell marker CD45R-B220 were also positive for c-Rel and for Jagged1 protein expression ( Figure 4C ) .
These results are consistent with our finding of a correlation between the expression of Rel/NF-KB factors and that of Jagged1 .
These data suggest that Jagged1 may play a role in B-cell activation , differentiation or function .
Discussion The important role of the Rel and NF-KB factors in the immune system has elicited a fervent search for Rel-regulated genes that may participate in the control of cell proliferation , differentiation and malignant transformation ( reviewed in Luque and Gelinas , 1997 ) .
Here , we report that the gene encoding the Notch ligand jagged ] is a novel NF-KB-responsive gene .
The induction of jagged !
by endogenous NF-KB factors and its inhibition by a dominant IKBOGAN transgene demonstrate its dependence on nuclear NF-KB transcriptional activity .
This study is also shows that c-Rel can trigger the Notch signaling pathway in neighboring cells .
The endogenous expression of Jagged1 in splenic B cells is consistent with its Rel-dependent induction and points to a possible role for Jagged1 in B-cell activation , differentiation or function .
Interplay between the Rel/NF-xB and Notch signaling pathways This study is the first to demonstrate that ReI/NF-KB can function upstream of Notch .
In our assays , c-Rel , RelA and endogenous NF-KB factors elicited specific activation of the Notch ligand Jagged1 .
In turn , the expression of Jagged ] correlated with the aggregation of non-adherent Jurkat T cells and Reh pre-B cells onto CCR43 cell monolayers .
This effect was dependent on the transcriptional activity of c-Rel , as well as on the expression of an intact Notch receptor at the surface of co-cultivated lymphoid cells .
Sup-Tl T cells that lacked a normal Notch1/TAN-1 allele and U266 B cells that did not express Notch1 failed to adhere to the cell monolayers and remained in suspension .
We do not rule out the possibility that cytokines or adhesion molecules induced by c-Rel may also contribute to these interactions .
However , the observed requirement for Notch receptor expression in these assays supports a model whereby c-Rel can promote 2807 J.Bash et al .

Expression of jagged !
in immune cells and tissues .
( A ) Northern blot analysis of endogenous jagged ) gene expression in human immune tissues .
A human immune system II Northern blot ( Clontech ) was hybridized to a human jagged ) cDNA probe .
The blot was rehybridized successively to c-rel and actin probes .
( B ) Immunohistochemical localization of Jagged1 to the B-cell areas of the spleen .
Cross-sections from adult mouse spleen were analyzed by immunoperoxidase staining of a monoclonal anti-Jagged1 antibody ( a ) or a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody ( c ) .
Normal rat serum ( b ) and pre-immune mouse IgG ( d ) were used as negative controls .
The marginal zone ( MZ ) showed strong staining for Jagged1 .
Hematoxylin-eosin staining is shown ( e ) .
RP , red pulp ; WP , white pulp .
( C ) Flow cytometry analysis of c-Rel and Jagged1 protein expression in mouse splenic B cells .
Spleen cell populations were enriched for B cells by antibody plus complement-mediated killing of T cells .
Cells were stained for expression of the B-cell marker CD45R-B220 with a PE-conjugated monoclonal antibody ( left panel ) .
This resulted in a population of > 80 % B cells .
Cells were analyzed for expression of endogenous c-Rel ( middle panel ) or Jagged1 proteins ( right panel ) with polyclonal antibodies specific for c-Rel ( sc-71 ) or Jagged1 ( # PCR8 ) , and a fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody .
Staining with the FITC-labeled secondary antibody alone was used a negative control ( middle and right panels ) .
the functional interaction of Jagged1 , with Notch receptors expressed at the surface of neighboring cells .
The Rel-dependent induction of jagged ] in cell monolayers also coincided with the initiation of signaling downstream of Notch , as shown by the activation of two different CBF1/Su ( H ) /RBP-Jr-regulated genes in co-cultivated lymphoid cells .
Endogenous HES- ] transcripts were upregulated reproducibly in Jurkat T cells cultured with CCR43 cell monolayers expressing c-Rel and Jagged1 , or with HtTA-Jag10 cells expressing Jagged1 2808 alone .
This agrees with a recent report showing that ectopic expression of the vertebrate Notch ligand Delta-1 can transactivate endogenous HES- ] gene expression in Notch1-expressing cells ( Jarriault et al. , 1998 ) .
Likewise , the cultivation of Reh pre-B cells with a CCR43 cell monolayer led to the specific induction of mRNAs for the B-cell activation marker CD23 .
These results indicate that c-Rel can promote activation of the Notch signaling pathway and suggest that c-Rel-mediated activation of Jagged1 is responsible for this effect .
Our findings do not exclude the possibility that other transcription factors contribute to the regulation of jaggedl gene expression in different cell lineages and at different stages of differentiation .
It also remains to be determined whether Rel/NF-KB-mediated activation of jagged ] gene expression is direct or indirect .
Further work is required to isolate the jagged1 promoter and establish whether its expression is controlled directly by Rel/NF-KB factors .
Relevance to the immune system In addition to its role in neurogenesis , myogenesis , angio-genesis and retinal cell development , the Notch signaling pathway has also been implicated in hemato-poiesis and in immune cell malignancies ( reviewed in Robey , 1997 ) .
Consistent with this notion , the expression of Jagged1 was shown to promote the development of primitive hematopoietic precursor cells , whereas activated forms of Notch1 and Notch2 influenced the differentiation of myeloid progenitors in response to different cytokines ( Bigas et al. , 1998 ; Jones et al. , 1998 ; Varnum-Finney et al. , 1998 ) .
In independent studies , overexpression of an activated form of Notch1 influenced T-cell differentiation during thymic development ( Robey et a/. , 1996 ; Washburn et al. , 1997 ) .
This process recently was proposed to involve the silencing of CD4 gene expression by HES-1 ( Kim and Siu , 1998 ) .
The mapping of three human Notch genes to chromosomal locations associated with leukemia , lymphoma and myeloproliferative disorders has also suggested a role in immune cell proliferation and malignancy ( Ellisen et al. , 1991 ; Larsson et al. , 1994 ; Milner et al. , 1994 ; Hasserjian et al. , 1996 ; Gridley , 1997 ) .
The demonstration that constitutively active forms of Notchl induced T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in mice confirmed this prediction ( Pear et al. , 1996 ) .
In experiments not shown here , we mapped the jagged ] locus to human chromosome 20p12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) in order to assess its possible implication in immune cell malignancies .
While this study was in progress , mutations at this locus were shown to be associated with Alagille syndrome ( Li et al. , 1997 ; Oda et al. , 1997 ) .
Although alterations in immune or hematopoietic function were not reported , it remains to be determined whether the disease results from haploinsufficiency or from a dominant-negative effect exerted by the mutant protein .
The ability of the Notch signaling pathway to influence the differentiation and proliferation of different cell lineages may also depend on different inducing signals and on the cellular micro-environment .
Our immunohistochemistry analyses revealed that Jagged1 is highly expressed in the B-cell areas of the spleen , particularly in the splenic marginal zone that is rich in plasma and memory B cells .
Consistent with these results , flow cytometry analyses further demonstrated a correlation between the expression of Jagged1 and c-Rel in purified mouse splenic B cells .
Although the function of Jagged1 in secondary lymphoid organs remains to be determined , both Notch1 and Notch2 are also expressed in the spleen ( Hsieh et al. , 1997 ; data not shown ) .
This raises the possibility of a role for Jagged1l-mediated signaling through Notch in the pathways that control the later stages of B-lymphocyte activation , differentiation and/or immune function .
The ability of the EBNA-2 factors induce Jagged1 expression protein of Epstein-Barr virus to induce expression of the B-cell activation marker CD23 through its association with the Notch effector CBFI in transformed B lymphocytes agrees with a role for Notch signaling in B cells ( Ling et al. , 1994 ; Hsieh et al. , 1997 ) .
Our co-cultivation assays - demonstrating that Jaggedl-expressing cells induced CD23 gene expression in neighboring B cells is consistent with this hypothesis .
Future studies will help to define the role of Jagged1 in the splenic micro-environment , and to clarify whether it signals through Notch in the context of a heterotypic cell-cell interaction or in a cell-autonomous fashion .
Recent work suggesting that soluble forms of Notch ligands can trigger signaling through Notch in vivo would be compatible with either possibility ( Qi et al. , 1999 ) .
c-rel knock-out mice are impaired for B-cell activation and antibody production ( Kontgen et al. , 1995 ; Carrasco et al. , 1998 ) .
The observation that all known B-cell growth factors failed to rescue the proliferative defect of these cells suggests that c-Rel may regulate the expression of genes , other than those for cytokines and growth factors , which are crucial for the activation and proliferation of B lymphocytes ( Kontgen et al. , 1995 ) .
Our finding that c-Rel can trigger the expression of Jagged1 raises the possibility of a connection between the Rel/NF-KB and Notch signaling pathways in secondary lymphoid organs .
Thus , in addition to controlling the expression of cytokines , immunoregulatory and adhesion molecules , Rel/NF-KB factors may also trigger a Notch signaling cascade important for lymphocyte activation and immune function .
Materials and methods Plasmids and cell culture pUHD10-3 contained seven tetracycline operator sites upstream of a minimal cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter ( Gossen and Bujard , 1992 ) .
An Xhol-EcoRI fragment containing the human jaggedl cDNA in pBluescript was subcloned into pUHD10-3 , after addition of an Xbel linker to its XhoI end ( pUHD10-3-jagged1 ) .
pHMR272 was used to confer resistance to the drug hygromycin B ( Bernard et al. , 1985 ) .
The parental HeLa-derived HtTA-1 cells stably expressed a fusion protein comprised of the Escherichia coli tetracycline repressor fused to the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein ( tTA ; Gossen and Bujard , 1992 ) .
HtTA-1-derived cell clones that conditionally expressed c-re/ ( CCR43 cells ) , re/A4 ( HtTA-ReIA cells ) or a truncated c-Rel protein lacking the c-rel transactivation domain were also described ( CCR-H5 cells ; Bash et al. , 1997 ; Zong et al. , 1998 ) .
The tetracycline-regulated HtTA-jag10 cell clone that conditionally expressed was generated by co-transfection of HtTA-1 cells with pUHD10-3-jagged1 and pHMR272 using a modified calcium phosphate procedure , followed by selection for resistance to hygromycin B ( 225 U/ml , Calbiochem ; Chen and Okayama , 1987 ) .
Drug-resistant colonies were screened for the inducible expression of Jaggedl1 using monoclonal antibody # TS1 , specific for the intracellular domain of the human Jagged1 protein ( a gift of Dr Artavanis-Tsakonas ) .
All HtTA-1-derived cell clones were maintained in the presence of tetracycline ( 1 ug/ml ) .
Human Jurkat and Sup-Tl T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells , Reh pre-B cells and U266 B-myeloma cells were obtained from ATCC .
The Jurkat T-cell clone constitutively expressing the IKBOAN transdominant inhibitor of was cultured in the presence of hygromycin B , as described previously ( 300 ug/ml ; Chu et al. , 1997 ) .
Where indicated , Jurkat T cells ( 5X10° % /ml ) were treated with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) plus ionomycin ( 1 uM ) for 2 h to induce endogenous NF-KB/Re ! l activity .
Cells were treated with dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ; 0.1 % ) as a control .
Cloning of a human jagged1 cDNA Differential display PCR ( DD-PCR ) analysis was performed as described previously ( Liang and Pardee , 1992 ) using RNA from uninduced and induced CCR43 cells .
RNA samples ( 2 ug ) were treated with DNase and reverse transcribed with Superscript reverse transcriptase ( Gibco- 2809 J.Bash et al .
BRL ) and a 5'-T ; CA primer .
Partial cDNA libraries were PCR amplified with 5'-T ; , CA and 5 '' -AGACGTCTGT-3 ' primers in the presence of [ G-3°SJdATP and resolved on 6 % sequencing gels .
cDNA fragments differentially expressed in response to c-Rel were introduced into pCRII ( Invitrogen ) by TA cloning and screened by dot-blot analysis ( Callard et al. , 1994 ) .
One of these cDNA fragments ( clone 1-2 , 106 bp ) was used to screen a human spleen cDNA library in Agtll ( Clontech ) .
Human clone A2-3 contained a 1778 bp insert homologous to nucleotides 1059-2837 of the rat jagged ] cDNA ( DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No .
L38483 ) .
A full-length cDNA for human jagged ) was isolated from a HeLa Uni-ZAP '' '' XR cDNA library ( Stratagene ) with probes derived from clone A2-3 and from human expressed sequence tag ( EST ) clone 117734 , homologous to the 3 ' end of rat jagged ] ( Research Genetics ) .
Phages positive with both probes were excised in pBluescript phagemids .
Human cDNA clone 14-6 contained a 5457 bp insert comprised of the complete coding region for jagged !
( 3657 bp ) together with 263 bp of 5'-untranslated sequence and 1537 bp of 3'-untranslated sequence ( DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No .
AFO28593 ) .
The sequence of human jagged ] cDNA clone 14-6 was analyzed using the EditSeq and MegAlign programs of DNASTAR .
Northern blot analysis Total RNA ( 20 ug ) extracted with RNAzol B ( TEL-TEST ) was analyzed in 1 % agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred onto Hybond-N or Hybond-NX membranes ( Amersham ) .
Membranes were baked for 10 min at 80°C and UV cross-linked with a Stratalinker ( Stratagene ) .
A multiple human immune system II Northern blot was purchased from Clontech .
Probes were generated by random priming with Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of `` P-labeled dCTP and dGTP .
Membranes were hybridized to probes specific for c-rel , jagged1 , deltal ( a gift of G.Weinmaster , UCLA , CA ) , IxBa ( a gift of A.Baldwin , University of North Carolina , NC ) , NotchI/TAN-1 , HES-1 ( a gift of R.Kageyama , Kyoto University , Japan ) , CD23 ( a gift of E.Kieff , Harvard Medical School , MA ) or the actin gene .

Immunoblotting Cell extracts were prepared and quantitated as described ( Bash et al. , 1997 ) .
Proteins ( 20 ug ) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes .
Membranes were incubated with immune serum , followed by donkey anti-rabbit ( Amersham ) or goat anti-rat horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) -conjugated antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs , PA ) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
Rat monoclonal antibody # TS1 ( a gift of S.Artavanis-Tsakonas , Yale University , CT ) was specific for the intracellular domain of human Jagged1 .

Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , blocked in PBS plus 5 % goat serum and incubated with polyclonal antibody # PCR8 raised against the extracellular domain of rat Jagged1 overnight ( a gift of G.Weinmaster , UCLA , CA ) .
Cells were washed in PBS , incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( Vector Labs ) and then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde .
Cells were washed in PBS , stained with FITC-labeled streptavidin ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs ) and mounted with 0.2 % p-phenylenediamine ( Sigma ) .
Spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice were enriched by antibody plus complement-mediated cell killing with rat anti-mouse Thy-1.2 antibody J1j to deplete T cells .
This resulted in a population of > 80 % B cells .
Cells were analyzed by double-immunofluorescence staining for expression of the B220 B-cell marker with a phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD4SR-B220 antibody ( PharMingen ) , and for the expression of c-Rel or Jagged1 using rabbit polyclonal antibody sc-71 ( c-Rel ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or # PCR8 and a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs , PA ) .

Primary antibodies were rat monoclonal anti-Jagged1 antibody # TS1 and mouse monoclonal antibody # 126 that recognized the B-cell antigen CD20 ( Dako Corporation ) .
Normal rat serum and pre-immune mouse IgG were used as negative controls .
Reactivity was revealed by immunoperoxidase staining .
2810 Co-cultivation assays HITA-1 , CCR43 or CCR-H5 cells were plated in duplicate in the presence of tetracycline .
After 24 h , one dish from each series was induced in medium lacking tetracycline .
After 48 h , the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) with or without tetracycline , and overlaid with Jurkat , Sup-T1 , Reh or U266 non-adherent cells in suspension ( 2.5 % 10° cells/dish ) .
