O'Shea* IL-12 is a critical immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immune responses and the differentiation of naive CD4* cells to Th1 cells ; however , relatively few IL-12 target genes have been identified .
To better clarify the molecular basis of IL-12 action , we set out to characterize genes up-regulated by IL-12 , first by contrasting IL-12- and IFN-a-inducible genes .
We identified several genes up-regulated by IL-12 , namely , MIP-1 @ , MIP-1f3 , IL-1 RA , and IFN regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) .
IRF-1 is a transcription factor regulated by IFNs that is also essential for Th1 responses .
We demonstrated that IL-12 directly up-regulates IRF-1 to the same extent as IFN-a « in normal human T cells and in NK cells .
We showed that IL-12 had a direct effect on IRF-1 , an effect not mediated indirectly by the induction of IFN-y production .
Furthermore , IL-2 and IL-12 synergistically induced IRF-1 , whereas IFN-a and IL-12 did not .
The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was demonstrated in two ways .
First , STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent transactivation of an IRF-1 reporter construct , and second , STAT4 binding to the IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA .
In contrast to IL-12 , no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells , and IL-4 did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 .
Therefore , IRF-1 may be an important contributor to IL-12 signaling , and we speculate that the defective IL-12 responses seen in IRF-1~'~ mice might be attributable , in part , to the absence of this transcription factor .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 : 7256-7262. cell-mediated immune responses and drives the differentia- tion of naive CD4 * cells to Th1 cells ( 1 ) .
Its importance is exemplified by IL-12 knockout mice , which are deficient in their ability to generate a normal Th1 response and to produce IFN-y ( 2 ) .
IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 ( 3 ) , which , in turn , phosphorylate other substrates , including the transcription factors STAT4 , STAT1 ( 4 ) , and STAT3 ( 5 , 6 ) ; STAT4 '~ mice , like IL-12 `` ~ mice , have defective Th1 differentiation and impaired cell-mediated immunity .
Despite the importance of IL-12 , there is relatively little information pertaining to IL-12-inducible genes and genes known to be regulated by STAT4 ( 7 ) .
In contrast to IL-12 , however , many IFN-inducible genes have been characterized ( 8 , 9 ) .
While it is clear that STAT1 is essential for many IFN-a responses , IFN- « , like IL-12 , activates STAT4 .
In addition , both IFN- and IL-12 activate TYK2 ( 10 , 11 ) .
This suggests that IFN- « and IL-12 may share a subset of target genes .
The similarity in IFN- and IL-12 signaling prompted us to define commonalities and differences in genes regulated by IFN-and IL-12 .
One well-characterized IFN-inducible gene is IFN regulatory factor-1 ( 12 ) .
Interestingly , IRF-1 knockout mice have a broad range of defects .
For instance , IRF-l-deficient mice have impaired ability to undergo DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest I nterleukin-12 is a critical immunoregulatory cytokine for *Lymphocyte Cell Biology Section , Arthritis and Rheumatism Branch , National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases , National Institutes of Health , and *Division of Cytokine Biology , Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , Food and Drug Administration , Bethesda , MD 20892 Received for publication August 14 , 1998 .

These mice also have defects in inflammatory and innate immune responses ( 15 ) and disruption of NK and T cell development ( 16 , 17 ) .
Importantly , IRF-1 knockout mice demonstrate the involvement of IRF-1 in multiple stages of the Th1 differentiation ( 18 , 19 ) .
IRF-1~'~ mice have defective IL-12 and IFN-y production and exaggerated IL-4 secretion .
The lack of NK cells in IRF-1~'~ mice contributes , in part , to the impairment in IFN-y production .
In addition , there is defective IL-12 production , which has been attributed to the presence of a potential IRF-l-responsive element in the IL-12p40 gene ( 20 ) .
Most importantly , however , in addition to impaired IL-12 production , CD4 * T cells from IRF-1~'~ mice have been shown to have impaired responsiveness to IL-12 , as measured by IFN-y production after IL-12 stimulation ( 18 , 19 ) .
Thus , although IRF-1 was initially described as an IFN-inducible transcription factor , the phenotype of IRF-1-deficient mice is dramatically different from that of IFN-y or IFN- receptor-de-ficient mice , which argues that IRE-1 serves functions other than simply transmitting IFN-mediated signals ( reviewed in Ref .
21 ) .
This was the second issue that led us to investigate the potential regulation of IRF-1 by IL-12 .
In the present study , we report that IFN-a « and IL-12 up-regulate a number of genes in common , including macrophage-inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -1a @ « , MIP-1 $ 3 , and IL-1RA .
Importantly , in addition to IFN-a , IL-12 and IL-2 , but not IL-4 , directly up-regulate IRF-1 expression .
Thus , although IRF-1 was initially characterized as an IFN-inducible gene , IRF-1 can be viewed as a transcription factor that is also regulated by cytokines that participate in Th1 responses .

B and C , IL-12 and IL-2 induce IRF-1 .
NK3.3 cells ( B ) and activated primary T cells ( > 95 % CD3 cells ) ( C ) were stimulated for 4 h with IFN-a ( 1000 IU/m !
) , IL-12 ( 10 ng/ml !
) , or IL-2 ( 1000 IU/ml ) .
RNA was extracted , and the RNase protection assay was conducted as described in Materials and Methods using radiolabeled IRF-1 and GAPDH probes .
any of these were IL-12 inducible .
IFN- @ -inducible genes are relatively well characterized and include GBP , ISG15 , and ISG54 , as well as MIP-1a @ , MIP-1 3 , and IL-1RA ( 26-28 ) ; we confirmed this in the experiment shown in Fig .
1A .
As is evident in this experi-ment , IL-12 up-regulated a subset of these genes .
Specifically , as with IFN-a , we demonstrate that IL-12 up-regulated IL-1RA , MIP-1 @ , and MIP-1 3 .
In contrast , IL-12 did not up-regulate GBP , ISG15 , and ISG54 .
This is not unexpected , as the latter genes contain IFN-stimulation response element in their promoters , which bind STATI/STAT2/p48 complexes , and IL-12 has not been shown to activate STAT2 .
IL-12 has previously been shown to up-regulate granzyme B ( 29 ) .
Interestingly , we found that IFN-a also up-regulated this gene .
Notably , we found that another gene implicated in the apoptotic pathway , RVP1 , was up-regulated by both IFN-a and IL-12 .
As control , the expression of DAD !
is shown ; neither IFN-a « nor IL-12 affected expression of this gene or GAPDH .
IL-12 up-regulates IRF-1 expression Because of the number of genes we found that were commonly regulated by IFN- and IL-12 , we next analyzed another gene typically induced by IFNs , namely IRF-1 , a well-characterized transcription factor that is important in regulating a variety of genes .
We therefore sought to determine whether IRF-1 was 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 7258 IL-12 CHX/L-12 8 Z o & IRF-1 w 1 2 3 4 capo ®® @ @ « - « o « o # « t FIGURE 2 .

uniquely regulated by IFN-a or whether IL-12 also up-regulated its expression .
Because NK3.3 cells are a useful model system to study IL-12 signaling , we first tested inducibility in these cells .
As shown in Fig .
1B , IFN- « induced expression of IRF-1 as expected .
Interestingly , IL-12 also induced IRF-1 mRNA expression to the same extent as IFN-a ( Fig .
1B , lane 3 vs lane 2 ) ; increased IRF-1 mRNA accumulation in IL-12-stimulated NK3.3 cells was reproducibly detected in 10 different experiments .
Because IL-12 and IL-2 have overlapping effects on some genes ( e.g. , IFN-y ; data not shown ) , we next sought to determine whether IL-2 had similar or distinct effects relative to IL-12 and IFN-a @ .
We found that IL-2 stimulation also induced IRF-1 mRNA ( Fig .
1B , lane 4 ) .
To confirm that IL-12 and IL-2 up-regulated IRF-1 in normal human T cells , we stimulated activated T cells with IFN-a , IL-12 , and IL-2 .
As shown in Fig .
1C , stimulation with IFN-a , IL-12 , and IL-2 induced IRF-1 mRNA up-regulation ( Zanes 2-4 ) ; increased IRF-1 mRNA accumulation in human T cells was reproducibly detected in five different experiments , using cells from five different donors .
The basal level of IRF-1 was higher in T cells than in NK3.3 cells , presumably because it was necessary to preactivate T cells ( see Materials and Methods ) to induce IL-12R and IL-2R « -chain expression .
Therefore , we used NK3.3 cells in subsequent experiments .
Since IRF-1 is regulated by IFNs , and since IL-12 and IL-2 are potent inducers of IFN-y , we next considered the possibility that the IL-12 and IL-2 induction of IRF-1 was indirectly mediated by the production of IFN-y .
We used several approaches to address this issue .
First , we directly examined the effect of IFN-y on IRF-1 , and under conditions tested , stimulation of the NK3.3 cells with IFN-y did not induce IRF-1 .
The lack of effect of IFN-y was due to an absence of the IFN-y-R B chain in this cell line , as determined by RNase protection assay .
In addition , we attempted to inhibit the IRF-1 induction with Abs against IFN-y .
Anti-IFN-y antibodies have no effect on IL-12-up-regulation , whereas anti-IL-12 Abs completely inhibited its induction of IRF-1 .
Finally , we also measured the amount of IFN-y in the culture supernatants after 4 h of stimulation and found that no IFN-y was produced at this time point ( data not shown ) .
To confirm that the enhancement of expression of IRF-1 by IL-12 was a direct effect , we next added cycloheximide ( CHX ) , a potent protein synthesis inhibitor , to our cultures .
As shown in Fig .
2B , CHX did not inhibit the IL-12 induction of IRF-1 mRNA ; in fact , CHX augmented the induction ( Zane 3 vs lane 2 ) .
This was not due to CHX alone , since CHX , in the absence of stimulation , did not alter IRF-1 mRNA levels as compared with the control INDUCTION OF IRF-1 BY IL-12 AND IL-2 , BUT NOT BY IL-4 N6 A a & + + oq 2 V § o 1 2 & = 3 IRF-1 « se ISG15 GAPDH « « » a » « » an an 1 2 3 4 5 6 B IRF-1 - cae ISG15 GAPDH % * « » a » am am an 1 2 3 4 5 6 C IRF-1 « ¥ C # 1 2 3 4 5 6 FIGURE 3 .
IL-12 and IL-2 synergistically induce IRF-1 expression .
A , NK3.3 cells were stimulated for 4 h with IL-2 ( 1000 IU/ml ) , IL-12 ( 10 ng/ml ) , IFN-a ( 1000 IU/m !
) , and IL-2 or IFN-a in combination with IL-12 .
B , Cells were pretreated with CHX before stimulation , as described in Fig .
2B .
RNA was prepared , and the RNase protection assay was conducted using radiolabeled IRF-1 , ISG15 , and GAPDH probes .
C , Northern blot analysis of IRF-1 mRNA in NK3.3 cells after pretreatment with CHX and stimulation with cytokines for 4 h. RNA was isolated , and samples ( 20 ug ) were run on a 1 % agarose gel , transferred to nylon membranes , and hybridized with an IRE-1 probe .
( data not shown ) .
This up-regulation was reproducibly detected in six different experiments and suggests the existence of a labile inhibitor .
We next examined the effect of stimulation with a combination of IL-12 with IL-2 or IFN-a .
As shown in Fig .
3A , IL-12 , IL-2 , and IFN-a induced IRF-1 mRNA ( Zanes 2-4 ) .
The combination of IFN-a @ and IL-12 induced IRF-1 mRNA to the same extent as IL-12 alone ( Fig .
3A , lane 6 ) , whereas IL-12 and IL-2 had a synergistic effect ( Fig .
34 , lane 5 ) .
As a control , the induction of ISG15 was also assessed ; IL-2 and IL-12 either separately or in combination had no effect on this gene ( Fig .
34 , lanes 2 , 3 , and 5 ) .
To confirm that the effect of the combination of IL-2 and IL-12 was direct and not mediated by the induction of another cytokine , the experiment was repeated using pretreatment with CHX .
As shown in Fig .
3B , IL-12 , IL-2 , and IFN- « induced IRF-1 expression ( Zanes 2-4 ) .
When tested together , IL-12 and IL-2 again had a synergistic effect ( lane 5 ) in the presence of CHX , whereas IL-12 and IFN-a did not ( Zane 6 ) .
These results determined by RNase protection assay were also confirmed by Northern analysis ( Fig .
3C ) .
Densitometry showed an 18-fold induction of IRF-1 with IL-12 , a 15-fold induction with IL-2 , and a 43-fold induction with the combination of both cytokines .
We next compared the kinetics of IRF-1 induction after IL-12 or IFN-a treatment , quantitating the fold induction of IRF-1 by den-sitometry .
As shown in Fig .
4 , CHX alone had no effect as compared with the untreated cells ( Ct lanes ) .
Both with or without CHX , IL-12 had little effect on IRF-1 expression after 30 min or 1 h , but the effect was more pronounced after 4 h ( 14- and 33-fold 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology wet ~- @ t wae « -- 04 !

induction , respectively ) .
In contrast , IRF-1 induction by IFN-a is maximal after 1-h stimulation ( 23-fold induction ) and declined by 4 h. Since both IL-12 and IFN-a exert their effect by similar mech-anisms , there is no obvious explanation for this difference .
One possible explanation would be that IL-12 activates IRF-1 through STAT4 , whereas the major STAT induced by IFN- « is STAT1I .
Perhaps differential levels of expression of these STAT 's can explain the different kinetics of IRF-1 induction .

Involvement of STAT4 in IL-12 regulation of IRF-1 .
NIH 3T3 « By A cells ( 4 ) and NIH 3T3 cells or NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with IL-2R subunits ( « By ) and JAK3 ( NIH3T3 afByJAK3 ) ( B ) were transiently transfected with 3xGAS-luc , IL-12RB1 , IL-12RB2 , and STAT4 and stimulated for 8 h with IL-12 ( 10 ng/ml ) , IL-2 ( 1000 IU/m !

To determine whether STAT4 was involved in IL-12-induced expression of IRF-1 , we assayed transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the STAT binding site from the IRF-1 gene ( 22 ) .
Since T cells and NK cells already express STAT4 , confounding any conclusions , we performed these experiments in fibroblasts ( NIH 3T3 ) specifically because they lack STAT4 .
NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with this reporter gene construct along with cDNAs encoding STAT4 and IL-12R subunits .
As seen in Fig .
5A , IL-12 induced transactivation of the reporter construct in cells transfected with receptor subunits and STAT4 , but not in cells transfected with receptor subunits alone , suggesting that STAT4 is required for IL-12-induced activation of the IRF-1 gene .
IL-2 also induced transactivation of the luciferase reporter gene in NIH 3T3aByJAK3 cells , but this did not require STAT4 .
This was expected , as IL-2 has been shown to activate STAT1 , STAT3 , STAT5a , and STATS5b .
To confirm that IRF-1 transactivation was mediated by STAT4 , we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with a plasmid construct in which a reporter gene was linked to a fragment of the IRF-1 gene containing the transcription promoter-enhancer region ( 24 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5C , this promoter fragment was able to respond to IL-12 , and this response was dependent on an intact SBE at position -123 to -113 , as indicated by the loss of IL-12 sensitivity when the SBE was specifically altered by mutagenesis .
Importantly , STAT4 was required for IL-12 induction of the IRF-1 promoter .

As shown in Fig .
5D , stimulation of NK3.3 cells with IL-12 resulted in formation of DNA binding complexes with the human IRF-1 promoter .
These complexes were specific because they were present in the stimulated cell only ( Fig .
5D , lane 4 vs lane 3 ) , were formed with the IRF-1 probe but not with the control probe ( Ct ! )
( Fig .
5D , lanes 1 and 2 ) , and were abolished with an excess of unlabeled IRF-1 probe ( data not shown ) .
Supershift experiments ( Fig .
5€ ) with anti-STAT4 Abs showed that the EMSA signal detected after IL-12 stimulation contained STAT4 complexes ( lane 3 ) .

IL-4 does not up-regulate IRF-1 expression and fails to inhibit IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 The phenotype of IRF-1 ~*~ mice indicates that IRF-1 is important for Th1 differentiation .
In contrast to IL-12 , IL-4 promotes Th2 responses ; therefore , we next sought to determine whether IL-4 also regulated IRF-1 expression .
In addition , IL-4 has been shown to inhibit IL-12-dependent induction of IFN-y ( 32 ) and to inhibit IFN-y-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 ( 24 ) .
We therefore also analyzed whether IL-4 blocked IL-12-dependent IRF-1 induction .
As shown in Fig .
6 , whereas IL-12 up-regulated IRF-1 ( Zane 2 ) , no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells ( Jane 3 ) .
Similar results were found using T cells ( data not shown ) .
IL-4 was active , since it induced the expression of IL-4R ( data not shown ) and inhibited the IL-12 induction of IFN-y gene ( Fig .
6 , lane 4 ) .
Interestingly , IL-4 treatment did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 ( Fig .
6 , lane 4 ) .
These data are important because they not only indicate that a Th2 cytokine does not induce IRF-1 but also because they confirm that IL-12 directly up-regulates IRF-1 .
That is , although IL-4 inhibited IL-1 IFN-y production , IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 was unaf-fected .
This further demonstrates that the IL-12-mediated induction of IRF-1 is independent of IFN-y .
Discussion IL-12 is a critical immunoregulatory cytokine implicated in multiple steps of Th1 differentiation .
However , the similarity in some aspects of IFN-a « and IL-12 signaling suggested that these cytokines may regulate some genes in common .
Moreover , the importance of IFN-a @ as an immunoregulatory cytokine has been suggested by several findings .
First , IFN-a has been shown to increase the frequency of IFN-y-secreting CD4 Th cells and therefore favors the induction of Th1 cells ( 33 ) .
Second , IL-12R B2 subunit , which is expressed only on Th1 but not Th2 clones , is induced by IL-12 and IFN-a during differentiation of human naive cells along the Th1 but not Th2 pathway ( 34 ) .
For these reasons we thought it important to begin cataloging genes induced uniquely and commonly by IL-12 and IFN- .
We show here that IL-12 up-regulated some genes ( MIP-1 @ , MIP-1 $ 3 , and IL-1RA ) that had previously been shown to be up-regulated by IFN- « .
Interestingly , it has been reported that Th1 but not Th2 cells produce MIP-1 « , MIP-18 ( 35 ) , and IL-1RA ( 36 ) , and that these chemokines are efficient chemoattractants specifically for Th1 cells , ( 37 ) .
Conversely , although granzyme B is recognized as an IL-12-inducible gene , IFN-a also up-regulated this gene .
Additionally , although RVP1 was not previously recognized INDUCTION OF IRF-1 BY IL-12 AND IL-2 , BUT NOT BY IL-4 ike hud .

IL-4 does not up-regulate IRF-1 and fails to inhibit IL-12 up-regulation of IRF-1 .
NK3.3 cells were stimulated for 4 h with IL-4 ( 1000 IU/ml ) , IL-12 ( 10 ng/m !
) , or a combination of both ( with IL-4 being added 15 min before IL-12 addition ) .
RNA was prepared , and the RNase protection assay was conducted using radiolabeled IRF-1 , IFN-y , and GAPDH and L32 probes .
as being regulated by either IL-12 or IFN-a , its expression was regulated by both of these cytokines .
In contrast , GBP , ISG15 , and ISG54 , each of which contains IFN-stimulation response element in its promoter region , were specific for IFN- .
We also report that IL-12 , as well as IL-2 , induced IRF-1 gene expression .
While IRF-1 knockout mice have a profound defect in Th1 development and cell-mediated responses , the mechanisms underlying this defect are only partly understood .
IL-12 is critical for cell-mediated immunity , and IRF-1 likely contributes to the regulation of the IL-12p40 gene .
In addition , a major source of IFN-y in the initial phase of the Th1 response is thought to be NK cells ( 1 ) , and IRF-1~'~ mice have impaired NK cell development .
This may be because IRF-1 contributes to IL-15 gene regulation and IL-15 is important in NK cell differentiation ( 16 ) .
Thus , the poor IFN-y production in IRF-1 ~~ is related in part to the absence of IL-12 and to the lack of NK cells .
But does this completely explain the Th1 defect in IRF-1~'~ mice ?
The answer appears to be no , because IRF-1~'~- mice have also been shown to have impaired responses to IL-12 ( 18 , 19 ) .
Stimulation of CD4* T cells from IRF-1~'~ mice with IL-12 induces substantially less IFN-y than wild type , even though expression of IL-12R $ 1 and IL-12Rf32 is reportedly normal .
Thus , it was suggested that impaired IL-12 production in IRF-1~'~- mice alone does not account for the Th2-dominant response observed .
Based on the present results , it can be proposed that the IL-12-up-regu-lation of IRF-1 is important for the action of this cytokine ; the unresponsiveness of IRF-1 ~~ mice to IL-12 may be related in part to the lack of up-regulation of this transcription factor .
It is important to emphasize , however , that our findings in an NK cell line and peripheral blood T cells may not directly relate to the process of Th1 development .
In addition , while our results that IL-12 induces IRF-1 expression may shed light on the defective IL-12 responses in IRF-1~'~- mice , IL-12 target genes are still poorly characterized , and it is not immediately clear how IRF-1 contributes to IL-12 signaling .
Nonetheless , our results clearly indicate that IL-12 and IFN-a @ activate a number of genes in common , including the transcription factor IREF-1 .
CHX did not inhibit IL-12 ( nor IL-2 ) -induced IRF-1 expression , which emphasize the direct 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology role of these cytokines in the up-regulation of IRF-1 .
Indeed , CHX enhanced the IRF-1 induction mediated by IL-12 .
What this labile inhibitor of IRF-1 expression is remains obscure .
Whether members of the PIAS family or the CIS/SOCS/JAB/SSI family contribute to this inhibition is unknown but is presently under inves-tigation .
Another possible interpretation would be that IL-12 mediates its effect on the IRF-1 gene by message by inhibiting a degradative enzyme .
Since there is no superinduction of IRF-1 by IL-2 , it could postulated that IL-2 is acting on the transcriptional level , while IL-12 acts on the posttranscriptional level .
It has been shown that STAT4 is essential for many IL-12 effects and is required for the Th1 response ( 30 , 31 ) .
We show here that STAT4 appears to be important for the IL-12-dependent regulation of IRF-1 .
We have demonstrated that IRF-1 transactivation by IL-12 was mediated by STAT4 binding and that the SBE present on the IRF-1 promoter-enhancer region was necessary ( Fig .
5C ) and sufficient ( Fig .
54 ) for the IRF-1 induction .
We used fibroblasts in our studies because they lack STAT4 and thus provide a useful vehicle for testing STAT4 dependence of IL-12 transactivation of the IRF-1 promoter construct .
Clearly , though , these results need to be verified in a more physiologic system .
That STAT4 has the capacity to bind to the IRF-1 promoter has been recognized since the cloning of STAT4 .
In the initial studies , STAT4 was shown to bind the IFN-y activation site ( GAS ) element of the murine IRF-1 promoter ( 38 ) .
Although the significance of this result was not pursued at that time , our data confirm that STAT4 binds the human promoter .
Whether IRF-1 and STAT4 function in concert to effect gene regulation or in parallel by activating different sets of target genes has yet to be determined .
Identification of target genes of IRF-1 and STAT4 after IL-12 stimulation will clarify this issue and help us to understand the gene-regulatory events mediating Th1/Th2 differentiation .
Comparing and contrasting IL-12-dependent gene expression in IRF-1~'~ and STAT4~'~ mice will be of considerable interest in this regard .
It should be noted that the IL-2-mediated induction of IRF-1 was , predictably , not dependent on STAT4 .
Similarly , although IFN-a can activate STAT4 , we have no data indicating that STAT4 is important for IFN-a-dependent IRF-1 regulation ; STAT1 is likely to be more relevant .
In contrast to IL-12 , IL-4 promotes Th2 responses .
IL-4 has been shown to inhibit IL-12-dependent induction of IFN-y ( 32 ) and to inhibit IFN-y-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 ( 24 ) .
Based on the phenotype of IRF-1 ~~ mice , IRF-1 appears to participate in Th1 differentiation , and interestingly , no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells .
Importantly , IL-4 treatment did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 , and this contrasts with the induction of IFN-y by IL-12 .
The experiment thus substantiates our claim that IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1 was not indirectly mediated by IFN-y production , as IL-4 blocked IFN-y induction but not IRF-1 .
In conclusion , we have demonstrated that IL-12 and IFN-a up-regulate a number of genes in common .
One important gene known to be regulated by IFN-a is IRF-1 , but it too is directly regulated by IL-12 and IL-2 , but not by IL-4 .
Thus , IRF-1 can also be viewed as a gene that is regulated by Th1 cytokines .
The demonstration that IL-12 induces IRF-1 expression may help to clarify the defects found in IRF-1~'~- mice ; loss of this transcription factor not only interferes with IL-12 and IL-15 synthesis but may interfere with some of the actions of IL-12 and IL-2 .
To what extent IRF-1 serves as an IL-12-dependent transcription factor will be better appreciated as we learn more about the genes induced by these cytokines .
