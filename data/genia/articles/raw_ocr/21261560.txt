IMMUNOBIOLOGY Expression of interferon consensus sequence binding protein induces potent immunity against BCR/ABL-induced leukemia Ming Deng and George Q. Daley Mice deficient in the interferon consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP ) develop a disease resembling chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , which in humans is caused by the BCR/ABL oncoprotein .
Interferon- « ( IFN- « ) induces ICSBP expression and is an effective therapy for CML .
This study examined whether enforced expression of ICSBP might antagonize BCR/ABL-induced leukemia ; results demonstrated that ICSBP-modified cells generated a protective CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell response against BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells in a murine leukemia model .
ICSBP expression represents a novel means of stimulating a host immune response to BCR/ABL+® leukemia cells and a potential strategy for immunotherapy of CML .
( Blood .
2001 ; 97:3491-3497 ) ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) is a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy caused by the BCR/ABL oncoprotein .
The disease is invariably fatal but can be cured by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) .
This highly morbid therapy serves only a minority of patients , primarily younger individuals with an HLA-matched donor . ''
The remainder are typically treated with interferon- « ( IFN- « ) , which induces complete cytogenetic remission , delays blast crisis , and prolongs survival in a significant percentage of patients . ''
IFN- « selectively suppresses BCR/ABL * cells in the bone marrow by restoring defective integrin function and apoptosis in CML progenitors , '' and may down-regulate BCR/ABL transcrip-tion .
* Although some patients treated with IFN sustain complete cytogenetic remission , persistence of BCR/ABL* clones can be demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , arguing that leukemia cells remain dormant . '' ''
IFN- « potentiates the development of antileukemic natural killer ( NK ) cells in patients with CML , and some IFN-treated patients in long-term remission have demonstrable cellular immunoreactivity against BCR/ABL sequences . ''
Specific T-cell immunity against an epitope on the proteinase 3 component of neutrophil granules has recently been demonstrated in patients who have sustained a complete cytogenetic remission on IFN- « . ' ''
These observations suggest that IFN encourages active suppression of leukemic clones by the immune system , but the precise molecular mechanisms by which IFN modulates immunity in patients with CML have not been defined .
Treatment with IFN induces JAK-STAT1/2 signaling and activation of transcription factors called interferon regulatory factors ( IRFs ) .
IRFs have homologous DNA binding domains that recognize a consensus sequence present in both IFNs and IFN-inducible genes .
IRFs modulate antiviral actions , cell proliferation , apoptosis , and integrin function and are also important in regulating hematopoiesis and immune responses . ''
Genetic disruption of IRF-1 or IRF-2 results in poor responses to IFN- « , -B , and -y and abnormal lymphocyte homeostasis .
'* Another IRF family member , the interferon consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP ) was identified as a conditional regulator of IFN-inducible transcription . ''
ICSBP expression is primarily restricted to hematopoietic tissues , where it binds to and functionally cooperates with PU.1 , an ETS transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression in myeloid and lymphoid cells . '' '' ''
Gene knock-out of ICBSP induces a CML-like disease in mice .
* '' Myeloid cells derived from ICSBP-deficient mice exhibit reduced spontaneous apoptosis and a significant decrease in sensitivity to apoptosis induced by DNA damage . ''
In addition , ICSBP-~- hematopoietic progenitors are hypersensitive to cytokine stimulation by interleukin ( IL ) -3 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . ''
Because the myeloproliferative disease observed in ICSBP-deficient mice resembled human CML , expression patterns of ICSBP were examined in patients with CML .
ICSBP transcript levels were depressed in the leukemic blood cells of patients with CML and restored in patients successfully treated with IFN- « .
*4 Retroviral transduction of mouse bone marrow with BCR/ABL resulted in a marked decrease in ICSBP expression , whereas forced overexpression of human ICSBP attentuated BCR/ABL-induced leukemia in a murine model . ''
These data suggest that ICSBP might act as a tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic cells .
Various studies have determined that ICSBP also plays a role in modulating the immune response by influencing the differentiation and maturation of immune cells and by affecting cytokine expres-sion .
`` * '' '' ICSBP-deficient mice have defective production of IL-12 and IFN-y , an impaired Thl1 immune response , and enhanced susceptibility to intracellular pathogens.2 '' '' We hypothesized that ICSBP might play a role in the ability of IFN- « to antagonize From the Whitehead Institute , Cambridge , Massachusetts , and Division of Hematology/Oncology , Massachusetts General Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA .

3492 - DENG and DALEY BCR/ABL transformation through immune suppression .
We tested whether ectopic overexpression of murine ICSBP could antagonize BCR/ABL-induced leukemia using a simple model system and have demonstrated that expression of ICSBP in the BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cell line completely abolished its leukemogenic-ity in an immunocompetent host .
Furthermore , mice that survived the challenge with ICSBP-modified leukemia cells gained long-lasting immunity against parental leukemia cells .
This immune rejection was associated with T-cell-mediated reactivity against cell surface antigens specific to BCR/ABL-transformed cells .
The immune-mediated rejection of leukemic cells induced by ICSBP is rapid , potent , and effective against pre-established disease , suggesting that ectopic ICSBP expression may provide a novel immuno-therapeutic strategy for BCR/ABL * leukemia patients .
Materials and methods Animals Six- to 12-week-old female Balb/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , ME ) .
Rag-1~ and nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency ( NOD/SCID ) mice ( Jackson Laboratories ) were obtained at 6 weeks old and maintained in sterile conditions .
Cell lines , transfection , and infection BaF3 , a murine pro-B cell line , '' '' was maintained in complete RPMI supplemented with 10 % conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells , as a source of IL-3 .
Mycoplasma infection has been reported to alter the tumorigenicity of cell lines and the corresponding host immune responses . ''
We have confirmed that the BaF3 cell lines we used in our experiments were Mycoplasma free by both PCR and antibody detection .
ICSBP and BCR/ABL constructs were introduced into the cells by electroporation using vectors pCXN2-ICSBP ( kindly provided by Dr Keiko Ozato , National Institutes of Health ) and MSCV-BCR/ABL-PAC .
Cells were selected in 2 pg/mL puromycin for BCR/ABL and 2 mg/mL G418 for ICSBP to achieve stable expression .
Moloney murine sarcoma virus ( M-MSV ) -transformed 3T3 cells and Lewis lung carcinoma cells were obtained form American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum .
Immunoblotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 % glycerol , 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 10 mM NaF , 1 mM ZnCl ; , 1 mM MgCl , , and 1 % NP-40 .
Total proteins ( 40 pg ) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 10 % ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane .
Both polyclonal « -ICSBP ( kindly provided by Dr Keiko Ozato ) and « -ABL antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution .
Horseradish peroxi-dase ( HRP ) -conjugated goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) and enhanced chemoluminescence ( ECL ) were used to detect protein expression .
Conditioned media from BaF3 and its derived cell lines were collected and concentrated with Centricon filters ( YM-10 ; Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs ) for IL-12 , IFN-y , and GM-CSF were carried out using Quan-tikine immunoassay reagents according to manufacturer 's protocols ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
CD8/CD4 fractionation The CD8+ or CD4* cells were purified or depleted from single spleen cell suspensions using Dynalbeads conjugated with CD8 ( Lyt2 ) or CD4 ( L3T4 ) antibodies according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Dynal , Lake Success , NY ) .
The purity of positively isolated cells and the efficiency of negative depletions were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis .
BLOOD , 1 JUNE 2001 » VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 11 Flow cytometric analysis Cells ( 10 ) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and incubated with phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated antibodies against major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I , MHC class II , CD8 , and CD4 .
For B7-1 and B7-2 detection , purified primary antibodies were used , followed by a biotinylated secondary antibody and PE-conjugated streptavi-din staining .
All antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen ( San Diego , CA ) , and cells were analyzed on the Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur immunocytometry system ( San Jose , CA ) .
Mice injection and analyses The BaF3-derived cells were injected intravenously into mouse lateral tail vein .
Mice were closely monitored and were killed if moribund .
Peripheral blood , spleen , and bone marrow samples were subsequently isolated from the mice for cell morphology analysis by staining centrifuged cells with the Hema 3 stain set ( Biochemical Sciences , Swedesboro , NJ ) .
Genomic DNA and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) were also isolated using DNA extraction reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) and RNA STAT-60 reagent ( Tel-Test `` B , '' Friendswood , TX ) .
Cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cold target inhibition assays Fresh spleen cells were isolated from either naive or Ba-P210-ICSBP immunized mice 2 weeks after the immunization and were cultured in complete K medium ( RPMI 1640 , 10 % fetal calf serum , with 50pM B-mercaptocethanol , 1 mM nonessential amino acids , 10 mM sodium pyruvate ; Gibco BRL , Rockville , MD ) .
Irradiated Ba-P210-ICSBP cells ( 20 000 cGy ) were cocultured with the spleen cells for 6 days .
On day 7 , cytotoxic activities of stimulated cells were determined in a standard 4-hour `` Cr-release assay with the following modifications . ''
Five thousand target cells were labeled with 100.Ci sodium [ **Cr ] chromate and incubated for 1 hour before use .
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) were added to achieve different effector-target ratios of 5:1 , 25:1 , 50:1 , and 100:1 .
Specific lysis was determined as follows : percent specific release = 100 X ( release by effector cells - spontaneous release ) / ( maximum release - spontaneous release ) .
Spontaneous release was less than 20 % of maximum release in all experiments .
Competitive inhibition studies were carried out by measuring the specific lysis of 'Cr-labeled target cells by a fixed number of effector cells in the presence of various number of unlabeled tester cells .
Unlabeled cells were added to the reaction wells at the same time as the **Cr-loaded target cells .
Results Expression of ICSBP did not alter BCR/ABL transformation of BaF3 cells in vitro The IL-3-dependent murine bone marrow-derived cell line BaF3 lacks endogenous ICSBP expression and is readily transformed by BCR/ABL , and therefore serves as a model to investigate the effect of ectopically expressed ICSBP on BCR/ABL-induced leukemia .
We created the Ba-P210 cell line by stably transfecting BaF3 cells with a BCR/ABL vector .
Subsequently , ICSBP was transfected into Ba-P210 cells to generate the Ba-P210-ICSBP cell line .
Both cell lines expressed a high level of the BCR/ABL ( P210 ) oncoprotein ; Ba-P210-ICSBP also expressed a high level of murine ICSBP ( Figure 1A ) .
The expression level of ICSBP in Ba-P210-ICSBP cells was comparable to the endogenous ICSBP level in the human lymphoid cell lines Namalwa , Daudi , and Ramos ( data not shown ) .

Two independent Ba-P210-ICSBP cell lines proliferated with the same growth kinetics as their parental cell line Ba-P210 ( Figure 1B ) , demonstrating that ICSBP expression did not exhibit an antiproliferative effect on Ba-P210 cells in vitro .
Expression of ICSBP antagonized BCR/ABL induction of leukemia in vivo When injected intravenously into healthy syngeneic Balb/c mice , Ba-P210 cells induced a rapidly progressive leukemia that killed the host in 3 weeks ( Figure 2A ) .
Spleens from injected animals were massively enlarged ( 10- to 20-fold above normal ) , and all mice had a pathologic burden of Ba-P210 cells in their peripheral blood , spleen , and bone marrow .
BCR/ABL expression was detected by RT-PCR in involved tissues such as bone marrow and spleen ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , all mice receiving Ba-P210-ICSBP cells survived ( maximal follow-up for 1 year ; Figure 2A ) .
Peripheral blood from mice injected with Ba-P210-ICSBP cells was monitored weekly and leukemia was not observed at any time even when up to 5 X 10 '' Ba-P210-ICSBP cells were injected .
The expression of ICSBP altered the leukemic behavior of BCR/ABL ( P210 ) -transformed BaF3 cells in a syngeneic host .
Intact host immunity was necessary for ICSBP-mediated protection We reasoned that the failure of Ba-P210-ICSBP cells to induce a lethal leukemia in Balb/c mice might be due to a cell-intrinsic proliferation defect apparent only in vivo or an indirect activation of host defense mechanisms .
To see if impairment of host defenses altered tumorigenicity in vivo , we injected 10° Ba-P210 or A Figure 2 .
Ba-P210-ICSBP cells fail to induce leukemia in immunocompetent mice , but remain leukemogenic in irradiated and immunodeficient mice .
( A ) A total of 10° Ba-P210 ( © , # ) or Ba-P210-ICSBP cells ( C ] , MMI ) was injected intravenously into normal ( il , @ ) or sublethally irradiated ( 450 cGy ; CJ , © ) Balb/c mice .

Both mouse groups developed lethal leukemia and died with comparable disease latencies ( Figure 2A ) .
This observation demonstrated that ICSBP expression in Ba-P210 cells did not alter the intrinsic tumorigenicity in vivo .
Thus , the inability of Ba-P210-ICSBP cells to induce leukemia in healthy Balb/c mice was due to an inhibitory mechanism that could be destroyed by y-irradiation .
Because a major effect of y-irradiation is compromise of host immunity , we investigated the importance of an intact immune system using immunodeficient mice .
We injected 10° Ba-P210 and Ba-P210-ICSBP cells into NOD/SCID and Rag-1 -- mice .
NOD/SCID mice are severely deficient in T/B cells and NK cells , '' and Rag-1~~ mice have no T/B cell function , but maintain relatively normal function of NK cells . ''
Similar to y-irradiated Balb/c mice , the disease latencies induced by both Ba-P210 and Ba-P210-ICSBP cell lines were comparable in NOD/SCID and Rag-1~~- mice ( Figure 2B , C ) .
This experiment strongly suggested that the protective function of ICSBP was dependent on an intact immune system in the recipient mice .
Furthermore , the result implicated T/B cells and not NK cells in the process .
Ba-P210-ICSBP immunization led to resistance against subsequent rechallenge with Ba-P210 cells To assess whether the induced immunity was directed against -specific antigens or antigens unrelated to ICSBP , we tested whether mice that survived Ba-P210-ICSBP injection could survive subsequent challenge with parental Ba-P210 cells .
Thirty days after a single-dose immunization with Ba-P210-ICSBP cells , mice were reinjected with 10° Ba-P210 cells .
All mice tested achieved long-term leukemia-free survival ( Figure 3A , maximal follow-up for 1 year ) .
This result indicated that tumor rejection was not directed against ICSBP-derived antigens on the tumor cells .
Immunized mice rechallenged with Ba-P210 cells 90 days after Ba-P210-ICSBP immunization also survived , demonstrating that the immunity induced by ICSBP expression in Ba-P210 cells was potent and long-lasting .
Mice injected with a sublethal dose of Ba-P210 cells ( < 5 X 10° cells ) failed to develop resistance to subsequent challenge with lethal doses of Ba-P210 cells , indicating that expression of ICSBP was critical to the development of protective immunity ( data not shown ) .
A single dose of y-irradiated Ba-P210-ICSBP cells ( up to 10 '' ) also failed to induce immunity ( data not shown ) .
Irradiation with doses higher than 2 Gy inhibits antigen presentation by B cells , '' '' but the failure of irradiated cells to induce immunity also suggests that proliferating cells expressing ICSBP are required to stimulate a protective immune response .

Injection of ICSBP modified cells ( Ba-P210-ICSBP ) generates immunologic memory for parental leukemia cells ( Ba-P210 ) .
( A ) Survival of naive Balb/c mice ( < ) or Balb/c mice preimmunized with 10° Ba-P210-ICSBP cells ( C ) ) following intravenous injection with 10° Ba-P210 cells .
Ten mice were used in each arm .
( B ) Balb/c mice received an intravenous injection of 7 % 10° spleen cells from naive ( 0 ) or Ba-P210-ICSBP immunized mice ( C ) ) , along with 10° Ba-P210 cells on the following day .
Five mice were used in each arm .
transferred from one animal to another , donor Balb/c mice were immunized with a single dose of 10° Ba-P210-ICSBP cells .
Four weeks after the immunization , spleens were removed from the donor mice , single-cell suspensions were made , and 6 X 10 '' mononuclear spleen cells were injected intravenously into nonirra-diated recipient mice ( representing about half the total cells from a single spleen ) .
At the time of spleen cell transfer , there was no residual Ba-P210-ICSBP cells detectable by genomic PCR ( data not shown ) .
Recipient mice were then challenged with 10° Ba-P210 cells on the second day .
All mice receiving ICSBP-immunized spleen cells were protected from Ba-P210-induced leukemia , whereas control mice receiving naive spleen cells died of leukemia with the expected latency ( Figure 3B ) .
Ba-P210-ICSBP injection protected mice with pre-established leukemia We have demonstrated that ectopic expression of ICSBP in BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells induced potent cellular immunity .
To test whether ICSBP-induced immunity could eradicate pre-existing disease , we first injected 10° Ba-P210 cells into naive Balb/c mice to induce leukemia .
A single dose of 10° Ba-P210-ICSBP cells was injected simultaneously into the same hosts , or following a delay of 3 , 7 , or 14 days .
Simultaneous injection of both cell lines allowed survival of all mice ( Figure 4 ) .
More strikingly , all mice survived even when Ba-P210-ICSBP cells were injected 3 or 7 days after the injection of the leukemic Ba-P210 cells .
When leukemia was allowed to develop for 14 days , equivalent to two thirds of the disease latency , all mice achieved prolonged survival and 20 % of the mice survived disease free .
The results demonstrated that the antileukemic effect of the immunized cells could be initiated rapidly and that ectopic ICSBP expression in leukemic cells was potent enough to eradicate established disease .
CTLs were induced by Ba-P210-ICSBP immunization To determine whether mice immunized with Ba-P210-ICSBP cells generated CTLs against BCR/ABL transformed BaF3 cells , spleens from naive or immunized Balb/c mice were isolated 2 weeks after immunization and tested in a cytotoxicity assay .
Single-cell suspensions were cultured for 6 days in the presence of y-irradiated Ba-P210-ICSBP cells to stimulate specific CTL proliferation in vitro .
A 5'Cr-release assay was performed on day 7 .
Spleen cells from immunized mice lysed both Ba-P210 and Ba-P210-ICSBP cells at comparable levels ( maximum of 94.1 % and 84.9 % , respectively ; Figure 5A ) .
No cytolytic activity was observed when naive spleen cells were used as effector cells , or when M-MSV-transformed 3T3 ( Balb/c derived ) or LL2 Lewis lung carcinoma BLOOD , 1 JUNE 2001 » VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 11 ( C57BL/6 derived ) cells were used as targets .
This result not only demonstrated the generation of specific CTLs from in vivo immunization , but also confirmed that ICSBP-derived antigens were unlikely to be the targets recognized by CTLs .
Cytotoxicity was also observed when BaF3 cells were used as targets , though at a lower level , indicating that antigens on BaF3 cells were also targets of the immune response initiated by ICSBP expression ( data not shown ) .
To investigate whether there were specific CTLs directed against BCR/ABL-associated antigens , we performed competition assays with unlabeled target cells .
Either BaF3 or Ba-P210 cells were added in excess as unlabeled cells to compete against *Cr-labeled target Ba-P210 cells in cytotoxicity assays .
The addition of excess unlabeled Ba-P210 cells was significantly more effective at inhibition of ICSBP-induced spleen cell cytotoxicity than a comparable number of unlabeled BaF3 cells ( Figure 5B ) .
This result confirmed that a proportion of spleen CTLs were directed against antigens associated with BCR/ABL expression , whereas other CTLs recognized antigens associated with the BaF3 cells .
CD8+* cells were the primary effector cells mediating ICSBP-induced immunity To characterize which T-cell subtype mediated the cytotoxic effect we observed , we isolated CD8+* or CD4 * cells from the immunized total spleen cell population by immunoaffinity fractionation .
Both positively selected CD8+* or CD4* cells and the corresponding depleted cell populations were used for CTL assays .
As determined by flow cytometry , positively selected cells were more than 85 % pure and depletions for both CD4* and CD8* cells were more than 97 % efficient ( data not shown ) .
Consistently , purified CD8* cells exhibited about 80 % CTL activity , whereas CD8* depletion resulted in more than 85 % loss of CTL activity ( Figure 5C ) .
CD4+* depletion had no effect on CTL activity , whereas purified CD4+* cells elicited only 20 % activity .
These results suggested that CD8+ cells were the primary cytotoxic effector cells in vitro and therefore likely to account for ICSBP-induced cellular immunity in vivo .

CML . ''
In the present study we have made the surprising observation that ectopic expression of ICSBP , an IFN-regulated transcription factor , induces a rapid , potent , and long-lasting vaccine-like effect against BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells in a murine leukemia model .
A single-dose injection with ICSBP-modified cells can eradicate pre-established leukemia in this model , and in vitro cellular cytotoxicity assays implicate CD8+* T cell immunoreactivity against leukemic targets .
As a modulator of IFN signaling , ICSBP might activate or repress genes that contribute to the therapeutic effect of IFN- « by enhancing immune recognition of malignant cells .
Unraveling the mechanism by which ICSBP expression stimulates protective immune surveillance against BCR/ ABL-transformed BaF3 cells may lead to novel approaches to leukemia immunotherapy .
Allogeneic BMT and donor lymphocyte infusion induce a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect , a form of immunotherapy that has a major therapeutic benefit in CML . ''
Philadelphia chromosome , positive cells persist in bone marrow and blood samples of patients with CML who are in clinical remission after transplant or chronic IFN therapy , supporting the notion that active mechanisms of immunosuppression play a role in maintaining leukemia in a dormant state . '' ''
Given that BCR/ABL represents a novel tumor-specific antigen , BCR/ABL peptides have been intensively studied for their ability to trigger specific immunity .
Indeed , peptides from the fusion sequences of BCR/ABL are bound by HLA molecules , and BCR/ABL peptide-sensitized dendritic cells can generate cellular immune reactivity .
`` *° Hints of specific immunity against CML cells have been gleaned from clinical trials in which patients have been immunized with BCR/ABL fusion In this study , we demonstrated that cytotoxic T cells generated by Ba-P210-ICSBP immunization were directed against antigens associated with BCR/ABL expression on leukemia cells .
It is therefore tempting to speculate that ICSBP enhances the presentation of BCR/ABL-derived peptides , but confirmation of this requires the isolation of specific CTL clones and definition of the target epitopes .
It is possible that antigens whose expression is induced by BCR/ABL may also contribute to active immune suppression .
A recent report documented that some patients with CML in remission harbor antigen-specific T cells targeted against epitopes of the proteinase-3 component of neutrophil granules . ''
The molecular basis for the immunostimulatory effect of ICSBP expression in BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells is unclear , but we have considered 2 possible mechanisms .
First , ICSBP may enhance antigen presentation or immune effector cell recognition by modulating expression of MHC or costimulatory molecules .
ICSBP can negatively regulate MHC class I gene which might render cells susceptible to clearance by NK cells .
We examined both MHC class I ( H-2D % and H-2K '' ) and class II ( I-A4 and I-E ' ) expression in our cell lines by flow cytometry .
BaF3 cells expressed relatively high levels of cell surface MHC class I , which was increased modestly on transformation by BCR/ABL .
ICSBP overexpression did not alter the cell surface-expression of MHC class I. MHC class II expression was not detected in any of our BaF3 cell lines .
Because costimulatory proteins facilitate the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T cells , and the costimulatory molecule B7 has been shown to induce cellular immunity against BCR/ABL-induced leukemia , '' we examined B7 expression in our ICSBP-modified cells .
BaF3 cells express low levels of B7-1 and undetectable levels of B7-2 , neither of which were altered by expression of ICSBP .
Therefore , we could not find evidence that the ICSBP-induced immune response against BCR/ ABL-transformed BaF3 cells was due to altered MHC or B7 function .
Second , we investigated whether ICSBP induced the secretion of cytokines that stimulate dendritic or T-cell function .
ICSBP-deficient mice are markedly impaired in their production of the T-helper type 1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN-y and have compromised Th-1-driven immunity .
`` * '' '' Both IL-12 and IFN-y are among the most potent antitumor cytokines .
IL-12-modified tumor cells activate CD8* cytotoxic T cells and tumor rejection in animal models , '' whereas IFN-y possesses both direct antiproliferative activity and immunomodulating properties , including activation of macrophages and enhancement of T-cell-mediated immunity . ''
Recently , it was shown that overexpression of ICSBP stimulates IL-12 p40 promoter activity in macrophages . ''
We tested whether enhanced secretion of IL-12 or IFN-y or both could be responsible for the immunoprotective activity of ICSBP-expressing cells in vivo .
We measured the levels of IL-12 , IFN-y , and GM-CSF , another potent antitumor cytokine , '' '' in conditioned culture medium of ICBSP-modified BaF3 cells .
None of these cytokines was detected by ELISA from Ba-P210 or Ba-P210-ICSBP cells .
Moreover , we failed to detect altered mRNA expression for these cytokines by microarray expression profiling ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the mechanism by which ICSBP induces antileukemia immunity does not appear to be a direct consequence of increased secretion of these cytokines by ICSBP-modified cells .
The vaccine-like effect in our system appeared to require coexpression of ICSBP and BCR/ABL in BaF3 cells .
We attempted to determine whether ICSBP expression would stimulate immune rejection of cytokine-independent leukemogenic subclones of BaF3 that arise spontaneously after prolonged liquid culture .
The ICSBP-expressing , spontaneously transformed BaF3 cells were From www .

3496 _ DENG and DALEY incapable of triggering an effective immune response on their own .
However , once the immune response was established by Ba-P210-ICSBP injection , mice were resistant to challenges from both Ba-P210 or spontaneously transformed BaF3 clones ( data not shown ) .
This result was consistent with our CTL assays that showed that CTLs derived from Ba-P210-ICSBP-immunized mice also lysed BaF3 target cells .
Presentation of BCR/ABL-associated epitopes may be particularly effective in ICSBP-expressing BaF3 cells , which are derived from the Balb/c strain , because we have been unable to demonstrate that ICSBP expression stimulates the same protective immunity against BCR/ABL-transformed 32D cells in syngeneic C3H/HeJ mice .
Future efforts will be aimed at determining specific peptide epitopes from BCR/ABL that can bind to and be effectively presented in the context of the Balb/c class I molecules ( H-2D4 , H-2K© ) .
Ren and colleagues have demonstrated that enforced coexpression of ICSBP attenuates and alters the disease phenotype induced by BCR/ABL in a murine model of CML , * '' but the precise mechanism for this effect or whether an immune phenomenon BLOOD , 1 JUNE 2001 » VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 11 plays any role is unclear .
Our data using a distinct syngeneic leukemia model suggest that ectopic ICSBP expression can stimulate a CD8+* cytotoxic T-cell-mediated antileukemia immune response that is active even against pre-established disease .
To our knowledge , this represents the first demonstration that expression of an intracellular transcriptional regulator , rather than a cell surface or secreted protein , can elicit a protective antileukemic immune response .
