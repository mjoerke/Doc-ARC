2464-2469 , 1997 Printed in U.S.A. GATA-1 DNA Binding Activity Is Down-regulated in Late S Phase in Erythroid Cells* Martin E. Cullen } and Roger K. Patient§ ( Received for publication , October 28 , 1996 ) From the Developmental Biology Research Centre , The Randall Institute , King 's College London , 26-29 Drury Lane , London WC2B SRL , United Kingdom We have set out to test a model for tissue-specific gene expression that relies on the early replication of expressed genes to sequester limiting activating transcription factors .
Using an erythroid cell line , we have tested the changes in the DNA binding activity of the lineage-restricted transcription factor GATA-1 through the cell cycle .
We find that GATA-1 activity is low in G , , peaks in mid-S phase , and then decreases in Gy/M .
In contrast , the binding activities of two ubiquitous transcription factors , Octl and Spl , remain high in GATA-1 protein and mRNA vary in a similar manner through the cell cycle , suggesting that the expression of the gene or the stability of its message is regulated .
Although a number of transcription factors involved in the control of the cell cycle or DNA replication have been shown to peak in S phase , this is the first example of a lineage-restricted transcription factor displaying S phase-specific DNA binding activity .
One interpretation of these data leads to a model in which the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding amplifies the effect of early replication on the activation of erythroid-specific genes at the same time as preventing activation of non-erythroid genes containing GATA-responsive elements .
These results may also relate to recent data implicating GATA-1 function in apoptosis and cell cycle progression .
The relationship between cell division and differentiation is still unclear .
In the hematopoietic system , it has long been thought that differentiation requires prior or concomitant cell division ( 1 ) , but direct evidence for a mechanistic relationship has been hard to obtain .
One potential mechanism involves the effect of DNA replication on repressive chromatin and stable transcription complexes .
The passage of a replication fork through a chromatin template is known to transiently disrupt both histone octamers and complexes of transacting factors required for programming gene expression ( 2 , 3 ) .
Subse-quently , as nucleosomes reform behind the replication fork , transcription factors have a window of opportunity to bind and either reprogram gene expression or reassemble committed genes ( 2 , 4 , 5 ) .
Evidence in support of a role for DNA replication in gene activation for a variety of viral and cellular genes has been provided by the activating effect of an origin of replication in transient transfection assays ( 6-9 ) .

2464 mal cellular context , a strong correlation exists between the replication timing of a gene and its state of transcriptional activity .
Specifically , replication early in S phase is associated with expression for a large number of tissue-specific genes in a variety of different cell types ( 10-13 ) .
A well studied example is the 3 globin locus , which is replicated early in erythroid cells where it is transcribed but late in fibroblasts where it is not ( 13 , 14 ) .
The major determinant of erythroid expression of this locus is the locus control region , a set of nuclease hypersensitive sites located several kilobases upstream of the first gene in the cluster .
The locus control region is required both for transcription and early replication of the B globin locus ( 15 ) , further maintaining the correlation between replication timing and tissue-specific gene activation , leading to a model where early replication removes repressive chromatin and allows activating transcription factors to bind ( 4 , 16 ) .
Transcription factor availability is clearly an important component of such a model .
If the overall nuclear concentration of critical factors remained constant in the cell cycle , titration of transcription factors by early replicating genes would limit their availability for binding to later replicating genes with the same control sequences , as has been suggested for the early replicating somatic 5 S RNA genes of Xenopus ( 4 , 17 , 18 ) .
Alternatively , sequestration of transcription factors to prevent activation of genes replicating in late S phase would be further enhanced by a concomitant decrease in factor DNA binding activity .
These considerations have led to the suggestion that fluctuations in the levels of critical transacting factors during S phase may amplify the effect on chromatin remodeling conferred by early replication ( 6 ) .
We have set out to test this model , using an erythroid cell line that contains both a transcriptionally poised globin gene that replicates during the first half of S phase ( 14 , 19 ) and GATA-1 , a lineage-restricted transcription factor crucial for erythroid differentiation ( 20 , 21 ) that has potential binding sites in the regulatory sequences of all erythroid genes ( 22 ) and is expressed at increasingly higher levels during erythroid maturation ( 23 ) .
We find that the availability of GATA-1 but not ubiquitous factors does indeed vary in the cell cycle in a manner likely to amplify the effects of replication timing .
GATA-1 therefore represents a candidate molecule for linking erythroid transcription and early replication .
These data can also be linked with recent observations that GATA-1 may be directly involved in control of the cell cycle and the choice among proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis ( 24-26 ) .

Asynchronous log phase cells were separated into different stages of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation , as follows .
10°-10° cells were pelleted , washed in phosphate-buffered saline , resuspended at a concentration of approximately 10 '' cells/ml , and injected into the chamber of a Beckman JE-5.0 elutriation rotor spinning at 3000 rpm containing ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline pumped at 21 ml/min .
The pump rate was incremented in 10-15 steps up to 65 ml/min , and elutriated fractions were collected onto ice .
Fractions were then pelleted , resuspended in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline , and analyzed by Coulter counter to determine cell concentration and size distribution .
Aliquots of 5 X 10° cells were removed , stained with propidium iodide ( 28 ) , and analyzed by FACS to determine the quality of the elutriation .
Adjacent fractions that consisted of essentially identical cell cycle profiles were pooled , and nuclear proteins were then extracted .
Cell Extracts-Elutriated cells were pelleted and then taken up at constant cell concentration in ice-cold 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.0 , 2 mM MgC ] , containing 0.05 % Triton X-100 , and a mixture of protease ( 5 mM benzamidine , 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 2 ug/ml leupeptin , 2 ug/ml pepstatin , 2 pg/ml aprotinin , 5 pg/ml bestatin ) , kinase ( 0.5 mM EDTA ) , and phosphatase ( 1 M B-glycerophosphate , 0.2 M levamisole , 0.25 M NaF , 20 mM sodium vanadate ) inhibitors .
After incubation on ice for 15 min , lysed cells were pelleted at 6500 rpm in a microfuge for 2 min at 4 °C , and the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 2 volumes of 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.0 , 2 mM MgCl , containing 350 mM NaCl plus inhibitors .
After 15 min on ice , nuclear debris was removed by centrif-ugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min .
Glycerol was added to the superna-tants to 25 % , and aliquots were flash frozen and stored at -70 °C .
Electophoretic Mobility Shift Assays-Nuclear extracts ( 0.2-4 pl ) were mixed with 7.5 ul of 4 X buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 2 mM MgCl , , 50 mM NaCl , 4 % w/v Ficoll ) , 1 ug of poly ( dIdC ) poly ( dIdC ) nonspecific competitor DNA , and specific competitor DNAs where appropriate .
Specific *°P end-labeled oligonucleotides ( GATA-1 , GCAACTGATA AG-GATTC ( 29 ) ; Oct1 , AATTCACTGG TTCCCAATGA TTTGCATGCT CT-CACTTCAC TG ; Sp1 , GCTAAGGCCC CGCCCCCACC AAGG ( 30 ) ; typically 20 fmols ) were then added to a final volume of 30 pl , and the mixture was incubated on ice for 80 min .
Binding reactions were then loaded onto a 4 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide/0.5 X TBE gel that had been pre-electrophoresed at 200 V until the current across it was 11 mA .
After 2 h electrophoresis at 4 °C , gels were dried down and auto-radiographed .
Laser densitometry was performed with a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer .
The cell cycle position of the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity was estimated by using the quantitative FACS data ( see , for example , Fig .
1a ) .
2n and 47 , representing DNA content at the beginning and end of the cell cycle , were defined as the positions of the peaks in fractions 1 and 7 , respectively .
The n value for the fraction with the highest GATA-1 DNA binding activity was determined relative to these .
Peak values from four separate elutriations were used to derive a mean cell cycle position for GATA-1 DNA binding activity .
Western Blotting-Cell equivalents of cell cycle-fractionated extracts were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and semi-dry electroblotted onto Hybond C+ nitrocellulose ( Amersham ) .
GATA-1 protein was im-munodetected with anti-mouse GATA-1 antibody ( a kind gift of J. D. Engel ) after blocking with 5 % milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05 % Tween 20 , followed by binding with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase and treatment with ECL ( Amersham ) .
Preparation of Total RNA and Northern Blotting-Total RNA was extracted from elutriated cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 81 ) , separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels , alkaline blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes ( Amersham ) , and probed with a `` °P random hexamer-labeled GATA-1 XhoI fragment .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To perform an analysis of GATA-1 DNA binding activity through the cell cycle , asynchronous MEL cells ( 27 ) were fractionated by centrifugal elutriation .
This technique separates bulk suspension cells by size and , because cell volume increases through the cell cycle , results in fractionation of cells according to their position in the cell cycle .
The cell cycle composition of the fractionation was assessed by FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells taken from each fraction ( a typical example is shown in Fig .
1a ) .
The percentages of cells in each phase of the cell cycle for a typical elutriation are summarized in Fig .
1b ( cells are defined as G , , S , or Gy/M depending on their DNA 2465 content ( 21 , 2-4n , and 4n , respectively ) ) .
We assessed GATA-1 DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
Nuclear proteins , salt extracted from equal numbers of cells through the cell cycle , were incubated with an oligonucleotide containing a strong GATA-1 binding site from the mouse al globin promoter ( 29 ) and electrophoresed ( Fig .
20 , upper panel , lanes 1-7 ) .
Nuclear protein from asynchronous MEL cells was also analyzed ( Zane 8 ) , and the identity of the GATA-1 band shift was confirmed by comparing the effects of specific ( self-competition , lane 9 ) and nonspecific ( an oligonucleotide containing a mutated GATA-1 site , lane 10 ) oligonucleotide competitors .
Clearly , there is variation in GATA-1 DNA binding activity per cell through the cell cycle , with low levels in G , ( Zanes I and 2 ) , an increase to a peak of activity in S phase ( Zane 5 ) , followed by a decrease in late S/G , ( lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Comparison of the FACS profiles for these fractions shows that GATA-1 DNA binding activity is highest in mid-S phase cells ( Fig .
1a , fraction 5 ) compared with early S ( Fig .
1a , fraction 4 ) and late S ( Fig .
1a , fraction 6 ) .
Quantitation of the GATA-1 band intensities indicates that there is a 4-fold increase in GATA-1 DNA binding activity between early G ; and mid-S phase and an 11-fold decrease between mid-S and G , /M ( Fig .
26 ) .
Analysis of GATA-1 DNA binding activity from several different elutriations revealed a consistent peak in mid-S8 phase .
The position of this peak was quantitated by referring to the FACS analysis of each elutriation ( see , for example , Fig .
1a ) .
27 and 4n , representing DNA content at the beginning and end of the cell cycle , were defined as the positions of the G , and Gy/M peaks in fractions 1 and 7 , respectively .
The » value for the GATA-1 binding peak in each case was calculated relative to these .
Data from four separate elutriations yielded a mean value of 2.981 with a standard deviation of 0.04 .
Thus , GATA-1 binding activity reproducibly peaks in mid-S phase .
The drop in GATA-1 DNA binding from mid-S to G ; /M was also reproduc-ible , averaging 7-fold in the four elutriations .
To determine whether the variation in GATA-1 DNA binding activity was particular to GATA-1 in this cell line or whether it was a general feature shared with other transcription factors , we determined the DNA binding activity of Oct1 and Spl , two transcription factors whose cell cycle-regulated DNA binding activity has been characterized previously .
Octl DNA binding activity has been studied in Hela cells , and it does not appear to vary relative to bulk protein through the cell cycle except during mitosis , when it loses DNA binding activity ( 32 , 33 ) .
We therefore determined Oct1 DNA binding activity in equal numbers of MEL cells by EMSA , using an oligonucleotide containing the octamer motif from the mouse IgH chain gene enhancer ( Fig .
20 , middle panel ) .
In contrast to the result seen with GATA-1 , Octl DNA binding activity does not appear to peak in S phase but instead is highest in the last elutriated fraction , which contains a mixture of G ; and M cells ( Fig .
20 , middle panel , lanes 1-7 ) .
As cell volume increases through the cell cycle , we conclude that the nuclear concentration of Octl competent for DNA binding remains broadly the same , consistent with the published data ( 32 , 33 ) .
A second ubiquitous transcription factor , Spl , has also been shown not to vary in DNA binding activity through the cell cycle in various cell types ( 34 ) .
We therefore sought to determine its activity in MEL cells .
An oligonucleotide containing a binding site for Spl gave a similar result to Oct1 , with the amount of Spl DNA binding activity increasing progressively through the cell cycle ( Fig .
20 , lower panel ) .
Thus , for two ubiquitously expressed transcription factors , it appears that there is an increase in DNA binding activity concomitant with increasing nuclear volume through the cell cycle , likely maintaining a broadly constant concentra- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 2466 GATA-1 DNA Binding Decreases in Late S Phase a unsynch 1 & 0 `` 2:70 Frac 1 I U to | __ ae Frac 2 `` wo |__ soo Frac 3 Fig .

In contrast , although GATA-1 DNA binding activity increases in a similar way through to S phase , it contrasts with the other two transcription factors by exhibiting a sharp decrease in activity in late S/G » .
GATA-1 revealed a similar profile when we took into account the doubling in nuclear chromatin protein during the cell cycle .
Fig .
26 is a plot of the data in Fig .
20 showing the change in DNA binding activities of GATA-1 , Oct-1 , and Spl for equal amounts of nuclear protein through the cell cycle .
The DNA binding activities of all three factors increase between G , and early S. However , GATA-1 DNA binding activity decreases in G ; /M ( to 9 % of peak value ) , while Octl and Spl remain high in Gy/M ( 93 and 147 % of peak values , respectively ) .
We next asked whether the S phase peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity reflected a change in the amount of GATA-1 protein through the cell cycle or whether GATA-1 DNA binding activity was being regulated by some post-translational mech-anism , such as phosphorylation .
Nuclear protein from equal numbers of cell cycle-fractionated cells was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , Western blotted , and probed with an antibody specific for GATA-1 ( Fig .
3b ) .
Variation in the amount of GATA-1 protein through the cell cycle can be seen ( lanes 1-7 ) , with a peak in mid-S8 phase ( Zane 5 ) , in the same fraction where DNA binding activity is at its highest ( Fig .
30 , lane 5 ) .
Furthermore , the magnitude of the changes in GATA-1 protein and DNA binding activity through the cell cycle is broadly similar .
Quantitation of band intensities indicates that between early G , and mid-S5 the amount of GATA-1 protein increases 5-fold while DNA binding activity increases 4-fold .
Similarly , between mid-S and G ; , /M the amount of GATA-1 protein decreases 8-fold and DNA binding activity 11-fold .

GATA-1 DNA binding activity peaks in mid-S phase .
a , cell cycle analysis of GATA-1 DNA binding activity .
Nuclear protein from equal numbers of elutriated MEL cells was analyzed for binding to a double-stranded end-labeled oligonucleotide containing a strong GATA-1 site by EMSA followed by autoradiography ( upper panel , lanes 1-7 ) , as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
The identity of GATA-1 was confirmed by observing the effects of 50-fold excess unlabeled GATA-1 oligonucleotide self-competition ( Zane 9 ) versus competition with an oligonucleotide mutated in the GATA-1 binding site ( Zane 10 ) .
The GATA-1 DNA binding activity of asynchronous MEL cells was also tested ( Zane 8 ) .
Oct1 ( middle panel , lanes 1-7 ) and Spl ( Lower panel , lanes 1-7 ) DNA binding activities were also measured , and binding specificities were confirmed by self-competition .
b , quantitation of transcription factor DNA binding activity per ug of protein through the cell cycle .
Band intensities in the above EMSAs were quantitated by laser densitometry and were normalized to the amount of protein per cell through the cell cycle ; they are expressed here as a fraction of the peak of GATA-1 binding .
GATA-1 DNA binding activity through the cell cycle is primarily due to variations in the total amount of GATA-1 protein and that post-translational mechanisms make at most a minor contribution to the change in GATA-1 DNA binding activity .
The varying amounts of nuclear GATA-1 protein through the cell cycle might come about by changes in protein stability , subcellular localization , or gene expression .
However , we have assayed GATA-1 DNA binding activity in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and found similar S phase peaks with low 2467 a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 G1 G1 s _ so $ G2 GM T ww < < = GATA-1 Us as on -- UU « t `` ﬂan-GATA—l Smmam : j - < GATA-1 < < = 288 ] < = 188 Fic .

levels in G , and Gy/M .
* In particular , we do not detect high levels of GATA-1 DNA binding activity in the cytoplasm in G , /M , which would be expected if the drop in nuclear GATA-1 DNA binding activity we observe in this phase of the cell cycle was due to shuttling between compartments .
To investigate the possibility that the variation in the amount of GATA-1 protein was due to changing levels of gene expression , total RNA was extracted from cell cycle-fractionated cells , separated on an agarose gel , Northern blotted , and then probed for GATA-1 message ( Fig .
3¢c ) .
A peak in the level of steady state GATA-1 mRNA was seen in mid-S phase ( Zane 5 ) , as found for both GATA-1 DNA binding activity and GATA-1 total protein ( Fig .
3 , a and b , lanes 5 ) .
The change in the amount of GATA-1 mRNA ( 6-fold ) between early G ; and mid-S phase is similar to that of protein ( 5-fold ) and DNA binding activity ( 4-fold ) .
The drop in the level of message between mid-S and G , /M decreases only a little less ( 4-fold ) than protein and mean DNA binding activity ( 8- and 7-fold , respectively ) .
Thus , the primary control over GATA-1 DNA binding activity appears to be at the RNA level , but there may be some additional control at the protein level .
Variations in DNA binding activity through the cell cycle have been found for ubiquitous transcription factors involved in some of the central events of the cell cycle , including Jun ( 35 ) , E2F ( 36 ) , factors regulating the expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis ( 34 , 35 ) , and S phase-specific histone gene expression ( 19 , 37 ) .
However , in contrast to these exam-ples , we have now shown that GATA-1 , a lineage-restricted transcription factor that targets tissue-specific genes , possesses S phase-specific DNA binding activity in cycling cells .
Activation of GATA-1 expression has also been seen in quiescent hematopoietic progenitors upon entrance into the cell cycle ( 38 ) .

Model for activation of GATA-l-responsive genes .
Left side , the availability of excess GATA-1 DNA binding activity when GATA-1 target genes are replicated allows GATA-1 to compete successfully with repressive chromatin ( gray circles ) .
Right side , the decrease in available GATA-1 prevents the activation of non-erythroid genes responsive to other GATA family members .
There are several ways in which our observations can be interpreted .
One possibility is that GATA-1-directed control of the erythroid program operates through the regulation of erythroid-specific replication origins containing GATA sites , causing early replication and hence gene activation .
Since several transcription factors are required as origin-specific replication factors by certain viruses , including Oct1 and BCCAAT/ NFL family members ( 39 ) , it is possible that specific replication origins located near to GATA-1-responsive genes may be activated by GATA-1 early in S phase , inducing early replication and subsequent transcriptional activation by GATA-1 .
An origin of replication has been mapped between the 8 and $ globin genes of the human $ globin locus ( 40 ) , and it is the origin used for early replication of this region in erythroid cells .
Furthermore , there is a requirement for the presence of the locus control region , which contains several GATA-1 sites and directs B globin gene expression , for early replication of this region of the chromosome ( 15 ) .
However , there is little evidence supporting a role for GATA-1 in eukaryotic origin activity or replica-tion , although it does appear to cause growth inhibition and bind to the origin of replication in Escherichia coli ( 41 ) .
Furthermore , from our data the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity ( Fig .
20 ) occurs too late to fire the $ globin locus origin early in S phase ( 19 ) .
A more attractive model based on the correlation between replication timing of genes and their expression ( 2 , 4 , 5 , 10 ) positions the effect of GATA-1 DNA binding activity downstream of replication .
We envisage that the observed pattern of GATA-1 binding through the cell cycle may be necessary to amplify the effect of early replication on transcriptional activation .
As early replicating erythroid genes become stripped of chromatin and active gene complexes , GATA-1 binding sites in regulatory elements , including the locus control region , become available ( Fig .
4 , left side ) .
By having sufficiently high levels of GATA-1 to compete successfully with the reassembly of repressive chromatin , the expression of GATA-l-activated erythroid genes is maintained .
We note that the replication of the locus control region , the major determinant of erythroid expression in MEL cells ( 14 , 19 ) , correlates well with the peak in GATA-1 DNA binding activity .
High levels of GATA-1 throughout S phase could lead to the activation of later replicating genes that are not part of the erythroid program but are normally responsive to other members of the GATA family .
Genes containing GATA sites are expressed in a wide range of non-erythroid tissues ( 22 , 42-44 ) .
Given the high levels of GATA-1 found in MEL cells , it seems unlikely that passive titration of GATA-1 by binding sites in GATA-1 DNA Binding Decreases in Late S Phase early replicating activated genes is sufficient to prevent the activation of later replicating genes , as has been suggested for the differential effect of transcription factor IIIA on the expression of somatic and oocyte 5 S RNA genes ( 4 , 17 ) .
Instead , we suggest that the decrease in GATA-1 activity that occurs during late S phase is required to prevent activation of non-erythroid genes subject to activation by other GATA family members ( Fig .
4 , right side ) .
By ensuring that GATA factor availability and target site accessibility occur in the same temporal compartment of S phase , subsets of genes with closely related control sequences can be activated independently .
Finally , another interpretation of these data has been prompted by several recent papers suggesting a role for GATA-1 in control of the cell cycle .
Ectopic expression of GATA-1 in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines can lead to alterations in the length of segments of the cell cycle ( 24 ) .
In particular , high levels of ectopic GATA-1 cause S phase to lengthen in NIH3T3 cells , suggesting that the reduction in GATA-1 DNA binding activity we see here may be necessary for the correctly timed exit from S phase .
GATA-1 also appears to function as an erythroid survival factor , since differentiation of GATA-1 negative ES cells along the erythroid lineage , or abrogation of GATA-1 activity in MEL cells , leads to premature apoptosis ( 25 , 26 ) .
Thus , the high GATA-1 DNA binding activity we see in S phase may be necessary to prevent apoptosis .
The emerging picture is that the choice among proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis is affected by the level of GATA-1 .
Our data demonstrating a peak of GATA-1 DNA binding activity in mid-8 , downstream of the G , /S cell cycle checkpoints , support the idea that GATA-1 has a cell cycle role in erythroid cells .
