5 Inactivation of IxBB by the Tax Protein of Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 : a Potential Mechanism for Constitutive Induction of NF-kB TIMOTHY A. McKINSEY , * JEFFREY A. BROCKMAN , ' DAVID C. SCHERER , '' SAMER W. AL-MURRANI , ' PATRICK L. GREEN , '' anp DEAN W. BALLARD® '' * Howard Hughes Medical Institute '' and Department of Microbiology and Immunology , '' Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , Nashville , Tennessee Received 25 October 1995/Returned for modification 5 December 1995/Accepted 6 February 1996 In resting T lymphocytes , the transcription factor NF-KB is sequestered in the cytoplasm via interactions with members of the IB family of inhibitors , including IxBa and IBB .
During normal T-cell activation , IxBa is rapidly phosphorylated , ubiquitinated , and degraded by the 268 proteasome , thus permitting the release of functional NF-KB .
In contrast to its transient pattern of nuclear induction during an immune response , NF-KB is constitutively activated in cells expressing the Tax transforming protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) .
Recent studies indicate that HTLV-1 Tax targets IxBa to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .
However , it remains unclear how this viral protein induces a persistent rather than transient NF-KB response .
In this report , we provide evidence that in addition to acting on IxBa , Tax stimulates the turnover of IBB via a related targeting mechanism .
Like IxBa , Tax-mediated breakdown of IBB in transfected T lymphocytes is blocked either by cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors or by mutation of IBB at two serine residues present within its N-terminal region .
Despite the dual specificity of HTLV-1 Tax for IxBa and IBB at the protein level , Tax selectively stimulates NF-KB-directed transcription of the IxBa gene .
Consequently , IBB protein expression is chronically downregulated in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes .
These findings with IBB provide a potential mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-KB in Tax-expressing cells .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia , an aggressive and often fatal malignancy of activated CD4* T lymphocytes ( 54 , 82 ) .
This oncogenic retrovirus encodes a 40-kDa protein , termed Tax , which appears to play a central role in the process of neoplastic transformation ( 31 , 50 , 55 , 69 , 75 ) .
In this regard , Tax has the capacity to constitutively activate members of the NF- « B/Rel family of transcription factors ( 5 , 44 , 59 ) .
This virus-host interplay confers Tax inducibility to a set of NF-kB-responsive cellular genes that are normally transcribed at high levels in response to T-cell activation signals .
These genes include those encoding the growth factor interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and the alpha subunit of its high-affinity receptor ( 19 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 67 ; for reviews , see references 27 and 28 ) .
Recent studies with mice transgenic for the tax gene suggest that the constitutive nuclear pattern of NF- « B expression in HTLV-1-infected cells is required to maintain a state of deregulated growth ( 40 ) .
However , the precise mechanism by which Tax induces NF- « B remains unclear .
The prototypic form of NF-kB is a heterodimeric complex containing p50 ( NF- « B1 ) and RelA ( p65 ) ( 4 , 12 , 26 , 38 , 46 , 52 , 57 ) .
In resting T lymphocytes , NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by virtue of its association with members of a set of inhibitory proteins , including IxBa ( 2-4 , 9 , 23 ) .
During normal T-cell activation , IxBa is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser-32 and Ser-36 ( 13 , 14 , 78 ) , which is a prerequisite for targeting this inhibitor to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( 16 , 62 ; reviewed in reference 22 ) .

2083 Tax stimulates the phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa via a similar mechanism .
First , IxBa mutants containing alanine substitutions at Ser-32 and Ser-36 escape from proteolytic breakdown and prevent NF-kB activation in Tax-expressing cells ( 13 ) .
Second , Tax fails to activate latent NF-kB complexes containing mutant forms of IxBa that are defective for ubiquitination ( 62 ) .
Third , point mutations in Tax that ablate its NF-kB-inducing activity also impair its ability to stimulate IxBa turnover ( 13 ) .
Fourth , phosphorylated IxBa accumulates in Tax-expressing cells following treatment with an inhibitor of the proteasome ( 13 ) .
Together , these findings indicate that cytoplasmic NF-kB complexes containing IxBa serve as a major cellular target of HTLV-1 Tax .
Recent molecular cloning studies have revealed another conditionally labile isoform of IxB , termed IxBB , which has significant sequence homology with IxBa ( 77 ) .
Although IxBa and IxBB likely interact with the same set of NF-kB/Re ! l family members , it appears that these two inhibitors display distinct responses to different inducers of NF-B activity ( 77 ) .
As previously reported ( 77 ) , agonists that stimulate a transient pattern of NF- « B activity promote the selective breakdown of IxBa .
In contrast , agents that elicit a persistent NF- « B response , including bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and IL-1 , are associated with IxBB inactivation as well ( 77 ) .
However , the relationship between IxBB , Tax , and the constitutive pattern of NF- « B activation observed in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes remains undefined .
In this report , we identify IBB as a second proteolytic target of HTLV-1 Tax .
As with IxBa ( 13 ) , Tax stimulates proteasome-dependent turnover of IxBB by a mechanism that requires the presence of two vicinal serines in its N-terminal region .
However , in contrast to IxBa , which is transcriptionally upregulated by Tax , steady-state levels of the IxBB transcript are not elevated in either Tax-transfected or HTLV-1-infected 2084 McKINSEY ET AL .
T lymphocytes .
Consistent with this observation , we show that the sustained nuclear expression of NF- « B in HTLV-1-transformed cells is associated with chronic downregulation of the IxBB protein .
As such , the capacity of Tax to permanently inactivate IxBB may reduce the concentration of total intracellular IxB below a threshold level required to render NF-kB exclusively cytoplasmic .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
Complementary DNAs encoding wild-type and mutant forms of HTLV-1 Tax ( 68 ) , human IxBa ( 29 ) , and human RelA ( 57 ) were cloned into the polylinker of the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV4 ( 1 ) downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter .
A full-length cDNA encoding IBB was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR ( 24 ) .
First-strand DNA was synthesized from 0.1 ug of mouse testis poly ( A ) * RNA ( Clontech ) , using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Promega ) and an oligonucleotide primer designed to hybridize to 3 ' noncoding sequences in the IxBB transcript ( 5'-CAGGTCTGCAATTITATTAAGTTGG-3 ' ) ( 77 ) .
The reverse transcription product was amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers ( 5'-CCCGGTACCACCATGGCCGGGGTCGCGTGCIT-3 ' and 5-GCTCTAGA GTCAGGCAGGGTTGGGGTCATC-3 ' ) ( 77 ) .
The amplified cDNA was digested with KpnI and Xbal , purified by agarose gel electrophoresis , and ligated into the pCMV4 polylinker .
Site-directed mutations were introduced into the full-length IxBB cDNA by the phosphorothioate method ( 49 ) and confirmed by DNA sequencing .
Epitope-tagged derivatives of IxBB were constructed by PCR with a 5 ' primer that fused sequences encoding the FLAG epitope ( 11 , 56 ) in frame with N-terminal coding sequences of IxBB ( 5'-GGGGTACCACCATGG ACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAATGGCCGGGGTCGCGTGCTT-3 ' ) .
The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid contained the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) « B enhancer cassette linked to a heterologous TATA box ( 71 ) .
Cell culture , transfections , and CAT assays .
Jurkat leukemic T cells and the HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines Hut102 ( 25 ) , C8166 ( 60 ) , MT-2 ( 48 ) , and MT-4 ( 47 ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 mM and antibiotics .
The HTLV-1-infected T-cell line SLB-1 ( 41 ) was maintained in Iscove 's medium supplemented as described above .
Where indicated , cell cultures were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( 100 wM ) or lactacystin ( 20 M ) ( both kindly provided by ProScript , Inc. ) .
In some experiments , cells were exposed to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ; 50 pg/ml ; Sigma ) .
Transfections were performed by either the DEAE-dextran method ( 34 ) or electroporation ( 13 ) .
Input DNA was normalized for all transfections by addition of blank pCMV4 vector .
For CAT assays , whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by the diffusion-based liquid scintillation counting method ( 51 ) .
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting .
Cytosolic extracts were prepared as previously described ( 66 ) except that the lysis buffer was supplemented with an extensive cocktail of protease inhibitors ( 7 ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( 50 mM sodium fluoride , 10 mM sodium PP ; , 1 wM zinc chloride , 100 wM sodium orthovanadate , and 20 mM B-glycerol phosphate ) .
For purification of epitope-tagged I < BB , lysates were equilibrated with ELB buffer ( 13 ) and fractionated by affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads ( IBI-Kodak ) .
Immunoprecipitates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) and transferred to poly-vinylidene difluoride membranes ( Dupont ) .
Membranes were blocked ( 13 ) and immunoblotted with a peptide-specific antiserum for either IBB ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; amino acids 330 to 359 ) , IxBa ( amino acids 289 to 317 ) , or RelA ( amino acids 529 to 551 ) .
Some immunoblotting studies were performed with an antiserum prepared against full-length murine IBB , which cross-reacts with the human homolog ( 77 ) ( kindly provided by Sankar Ghosh , Yale University School of Medicine ) .
Immunoreactive proteins were detected by using anti-rabbit im-munoglobulin G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Amersham ) in conjunction with the Renaissance chemiluminescence system ( Dupont ) .
Gel retardation assays .
Nuclear fractions were prepared from Jurkat T-cell transfectants by high-salt extraction ( 66 ) in the presence of protease inhibitors ( 7 ) .
Gel mobility shift assays were performed as previously described ( 13 ) , using a `` P-radiolabeled palindromic probe derived from xB enhancer sequences in the IL-2 receptor alpha promoter ( 5'-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCC TT-3 ' ) ( 7 ) .
Northern ( RNA ) blot analyses .
Total RNA was prepared as previously described ( 18 ) except that cells were lysed in Tris-buffered 4 M guanidine isothio-cyanate ( Gibco/BRL ) supplemented with 10 % Sarkosyl .
Poly ( A ) * RNA was purified from approximately 750 ug of total RNA by using the polyAtract mRNA isolation system ( Promega ) and fractionated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels ( 18 ) .
Following electrophoresis , RNA was transferred to Zeta Probe membranes ( Bio-Rad ) and sequentially hybridized with the indicated *°P-radiolabeled cDNA probes at 42°C in a solution containing 50 % formamide , 5 % SSC ( 1 % SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 sodium citrate ) , 1X Denhardt 's reagent , 1 % SDS , and 0.1 mg of salmon testis DNA ( Sigma ) per ml .
Radiola-beled probes were generated by using a Random Primed DNA Labeling kit ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .

Nucleoprotein complexes containing RelA homodimers ( upper arrow ) and RelA/p50 heterodimers ( lower arrow ) are indicated .
RESULTS IBB regulates NF-KB function in human T lymphocytes .
Constitutive nuclear expression of NF-kB in HTLV-1 Tax-expressing cells is associated with proteolytic inactivation of IxBa by the 268 proteasome ( 13 , 62 ) .
To establish an in vivo assay for examining whether Tax alters the stability of IxBB , we first compared the capacities of ectopic IxBa and IxBB to inhibit NF- « B-dependent transcription in T-cell transfectants .
Jurkat T lymphocytes were cotransfected with a CAT reporter plasmid containing two NF- « B binding sites from the HIV-1 enhancer ( HIV-kB-CAT ) , an effector plasmid encoding the RelA transactivating subunit of NF-kB , and graded amounts of expression vectors for either IxBa or IxBB .
As shown in Fig .
1A , both IxBa and IxBB inhibited RelA-dependent transcription of the CAT reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner .
In keeping with these functional results , gel retardation assays performed with nuclear extracts from RelA-expressing transfectants indicated that both IxBa and IxBB efficiently blocked the DNA binding activity of RelA homodimers ( Fig .
1B ; upper complex ) .
These inhibitors also sequestered the kB-specific activity of NF-kB ( lower complex ) , which is generated as a consequence of RelA-mediated transactivation of the NF- « B1 gene encoding the p50 subunit ( 76 ) .
HTLV-1 Tax renders IBB susceptible to proteasome-dependent degradation .
Having established that ectopic IxBB inhibits NF-xB in transfected human T cells , we next compared the stabilities of IxBB and IxBa when independently coexpressed with HTLV-1 Tax .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with pCMV4 expression vectors ( 1 ) encoding FLAG epitope-tagged forms of these inhibitors and wild-type Tax .
Transfected cells were exposed to CHX in order to prevent de novo protein synthesis .
As shown in Fig .
2A , coexpression with Tax led to a significant reduction in the cytoplasmic levels of both IxBa and IxBfB relative to that observed in Tax-deficient con-trols .
These studies also suggested that IxBB and IxBa are Vou .

HTLV-1 Tax stimulates proteasome-dependent degradation of IBB .
( A ) Jurkat T cells were cotransfected by electroporation with expression vectors encoding Tax ( 10 ug ) and either FLAG-tagged IxBa ( 2 ug ) or IxBB ( 0.5 mg ) .
Total DNA input was normalized by using the pCMV4 vector .
Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from transfected cells after treatment with CHX for the indicated times .
Ectopic forms of IxB were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies , resolved by SDS-PAGE , and immunoblotted with either IxBa- or I < BB-specific antiserum .
( B ) Jurkat cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged IxB $ B ( 1 ug ) and either wild-type Tax ( Tax-WT ) ( 10 g ) or a mutant of Tax defective in NF- « B ( Tax-M22 ) or CREB/ATF ( Tax-M47 ) activating function ( 10 pg ) .
After 48 h in culture , cells were treated with CHX for 6 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated as described above and immunoblotted with IxBB-specific antiserum .
( C and D ) Jurkat T cells were transfected by electroporation with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged I « BB ( 1 g ) in the absence or presence of a Tax expression vector ( 10 pg ) .
After 48 h of culture , cells were treated with CHX for 1 h and then exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( 100 wM ) or lactacystin ( 20 wM ) for 6 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated and immunoblotted with an IxBB-specific antiserum as described above .
degraded with distinct kinetics in Tax-expressing cells .
To provide stringent controls for these experiments , we also used vectors for Tax containing missense mutations that selectively disrupt its ability to access either the CREB/ATF ( Tax-M47 ) or NF-kB/Rel ( Tax-M22 ) transcription factor pathway ( 68 ) .
The steady-state level of ectopic IxBB was substantially reduced in control cells expressing wild-type Tax ( Tax-WT ) ( Fig .
2B , lane 2 ) .
Consistent with their differing capacities to induce NF-kB , expression of Tax-M47 but not Tax-M22 resulted in the degradative loss of IxBB ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
These findings correlate the NF- function of Tax with its ability to destabilize IxBB in transfected T cells .
Recent studies suggest that the constitutive turnover of IxBa in cells expressing Tax is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( 13 , 62 ) .
To examine whether Tax also targets IxBB to the proteasome , we assessed the ability of the previously described proteasome inhibitors MG132 ( 53 ) and lactacystin ( 21 ) to block Tax-induced turnover of IxBB in Jurkat T-cell transfectants .
As shown in Fig .
2C , ectopic IxBB was efficiently degraded in control cells ( lane 2 ) but escaped from Tax-dependent breakdown in cells treated with MG132 ( lane 3 ) .
Similar results were obtained with lactacystin , a highly specific inhibitor of the proteasome ( Fig .
2D ) .
Coupled with the data shown in Fig .
2A and B , these transfection studies impli- cate the proteasome degradation pathway in the mechanism by which Tax inactivates IBB .
Identification of two regulatory serines in the N terminus of IBB .
IxBa contains two highly conserved serine residues at positions 32 and 36 which are required for its signal-dependent phosphorylation ( 13 , 14 , 78 ) , ubiquitination ( 16 , 62 ) , and degradation ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 78 ) .
Disruption of either Ser-32 or Ser-36 in IxBa yields a constitutive NF-kB inhibitor that remains stable despite the presence of HTLV-1 Tax ( 13 ) .
Inspection of the deduced N-terminal sequence of IxBB ( 77 ) revealed a motif containing two serines ( Asp-Ser-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu ; amino acids 18 to 24 ) that is strikingly similar to that found in IxBa ( Asp-Ser-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser-Met ; amino acids 31 to 37 ) ( 29 ) .
To explore whether Ser-19 and Ser-23 of IxBB are required for inactivation by Tax , a series of specific amino acid substitutions was introduced into the full-length inhibitor .
All of the corresponding mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels in vivo ( data not shown ) .
As illustrated in Fig .
3A , substitution of alanine for either Ser-19 or Ser-23 in ectopic IxBB ( mutants $ 19A and $ 23A ) markedly attenuated Tax-mediated transactivation of HIV- « kB-CAT in Jurkat T-cell transfectants .
Similar results were obtained with an IBB mutant containing simultaneous Ser- > Ala substitutions at these positions ( mutant $ 19/23A ) .

Serine residues 19 and 23 of IxBB are required for inactivation by Tax .
( A ) Induction of NF- « B transcriptional activity .
Jurkat T cells were transfected by electroporation with HIV- « kB-CAT ( 5 pg ) along with cDNA expression vectors encoding Tax ( 5 ug ) and the indicated site-directed mutants of IxBB ( 2.5 ug ) .
After 48 h of growth , cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity .

To extend these findings , biochemical experiments were performed to monitor the stability of the $ 19/23A mutant of IxBB when coexpressed with Tax in vivo .
As shown in Fig .
3B , wild-type IxBB ( lane 2 ) and $ 19/23A ( lane 3 ) were expressed at comparable levels in the cytoplasm of Tax-deficient cells .
Furthermore , the $ 19/23A mutant retained the capacity to form stable cytoplasmic complexes with endogenous RelA ( lane 6 ) .

We next performed gel retardation studies to determine whether the relative stabilities of these inhibitors in the presence of Tax correlated with the induction of nuclear NF- « B expression .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding RelA , Tax , and either wild-type IBB or mutant $ 19/23A .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from recipient cells and analyzed for « B-specific DNA binding activity in mobility shift assays .
As shown in Fig .
3D ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , significant amounts of NF- « B were detected in nuclear extracts from control cells overexpressing RelA but lacking ectopic IxBB .
However , coexpression with either wild-type IBB ( lane 3 ) or $ 19/23A ( lane 5 ) blocked the formation of these nucleoprotein complexes .
In cells expressing HTLV-1 Tax , the wild-type inhibitor was efficiently inactivated , as evidenced by the accumulation of nuclear NF- « B ( lane 4 ) .
In contrast , Tax failed to mobilize NF-kB complexes containing the $ 19/23A mutant ( lane 6 ) .
We conclude that Tax targets both IkxBa and IxBB for degradation through a related proteasome-dependent mechanism , which requires the presence of conserved serine residues in their N-terminal regions ( 13 , 14 , 78 ) .
Differential expression of IB proteins in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes .
To assess the physiologic relevance of our observations with transfected cells , we next examined the functional interplay between IxBB and Tax in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes .
For these studies , we used , in addition to Jurkat T cells , five independent HTLV-1-transformed cell lines , SLB-1 ( 41 ) , Hut102 ( 25 ) , C8166 ( 60 ) , MT-2 ( 48 ) , and MT-4 ( 47 ) .
The SLB-1 , Hut102 , and MT-2 cell lines are chronically infected with HTLV-1 and produce infectious virions capable of transforming primary human T lymphocytes .
The C8166 and MT-4 cells served as controls for Tax-specific effects .
Whereas C8166 cells are infected with a defective HTLV-1 that selectively expresses Tax , MT-4 cells harbor a partially deleted HTLV-1 genome that fails to direct the synthesis of a functional Tax protein .
In agreement with prior studies ( 42 , 72 ) , immunoblotting with peptide-specific antisera revealed the presence of two prominent isoforms of IxBa in cytoplasmic extracts from SLB-1 , Hut102 , C8166 , and MT-2 cells ( Fig .
4A , lanes 2 to 5 ) but not in MT-4 ( lane 6 ) or uninfected Jurkat T ( lane 1 ) cells .
As shown in Fig .
4D , the more slowly migrating species was sensitive to treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase ( lane 2 ) and thus likely represents the hyperphosphorylated form of IxBa that is modified at Ser-32 and Ser-36 ( 13 , 14 , 42 , 72 , 78 ) .
Consistent with previously published reports ( 13 , 37 , 42 , 72 ) , the presence of the hyperphosphorylated isoform of IxBa was dependent on Tax expression ( Fig .
4C ) .
In contrast to IxBa , the steady-state level of IxBB protein was drastically reduced in each of the cell lines expressing Tax ( Fig .
4B , lanes 2 to 5 ) .
However , IxBB was readily detected in Tax-deficient cells ( lanes 1 and 6 ) .
These results suggest that IxBB protein expression is downregulated in HTLV-1-infected cells by a Tax-dependent mechanism .
The peptide aldehyde MG132 blocks NF-kB induction by preventing proteasome-mediated degradation of hyperphosphorylated IxBa ( 16 , 53 ) .
To determine its effects on Tax-mediated turnover of endogenous IxBa and IxBB , we treated HTLV-1-transformed cell lines with MG132 and monitored IxB expression by immunoblot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
5A , incubation of C8166 cells with MG132 led to the rapid accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated form of IkBa ( top panel ) .
The observed increase in cytoplasmic IkBa protein was due to repression of Tax-mediated proteolysis rather than basal turnover , because Tax-deficient MT -4 cells maintained a constant steady-state level of IxBa over the same time course ( Fig .
5A , bottom panel ) .
In contrast , at doses sufficient to prevent proteolytic breakdown of ectopic IkBB ( Fig .

IxBB protein expression is downregulated in HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes .
Equivalent amounts of cytoplasmic protein ( 100 mg ) from either uninfected Jurkat T cells ( lane 1 ) or the indicated HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines ( lanes 2 to 6 ) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with a peptide-specific antibody raised against either IxBa ( amino acids 289 to 317 ; A ) , IxBB ( amino acids 330-359 ; B ) , or Tax ( C ) .
Similar results were obtained when an independent IxBB-specific antiserum generated against the full-length inhibitor was used .
( D ) Cytoplasmic extracts from MT-2 cells were incubated in the presence ( lanes 2 and 3 ) or absence ( lane 1 ) of calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with an IxBo-specific antiserum .
Control reactions ( lane 3 ) were supplemented with a previously described cocktail of phosphatase inhibitors ( INH ) ( 13 ) .
MG132 failed to affect the cytoplasmic pool of endogenous IxBB ( Fig .

These results with endogenous IxBB were recapitulated in assays using three independent Tax-expressing cell lines , SLB-1 , Hut102 , and MT-2 ( data not shown ) .
The capacity of MG132 to mediate the rapid accumulation of endogenous IxBa but not IxBB suggests that these two inhibitors are synthesized at different rates in the presence of Tax .
HTLV-1 Tax transcriptionally induces IxBa but not IBB .
During normal T-cell activation , a transient NF-kB response is maintained by an autoregulatory mechanism that involves NF-xB-directed transcription of the IxBa gene ( 8 , 15 , 17 , 20 , 30 , 36 , 43 , 73 ) .
Although the cis-acting elements that regulate the IxBB gene remain undefined , a recent report suggests that this transcription unit is not under NF-kB control ( 77 ) .
On the basis of these prior observations , we reasoned that the distinct patterns of IxB expression observed in HTLV-1-infected cells ( Fig .
4 and 5 ) may reflect the capacity of Tax to selectively stimulate NF- « xB-dependent transcription of the IxBa gene .
To test this hypothesis , we examined the steady-state levels of IxBa and IxBB transcripts in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines .
As shown in Fig .
6A , IxBa mRNA pools were dramatically elevated in virally infected cells expressing Tax ( lanes 2 to 4 ) relative to the level observed in Tax-deficient MT -4 cells ( lane 1 ) .
In sharp contrast to IxBa , comparable amounts of IkBB mRNA were detected in each of these transformed cell lines ( Fig .
6A , middle panel ) .
Experiments were next performed to determine whether the NF- « B-activating function of Tax is required to elicit these transcriptional responses .
For these studies , we examined the steady-state levels of IxB transcripts in Jurkat T cells following transfection with plasmids encoding wild-type Tax ( Tax-WT ) or mutants of Tax that are unable to stimulate either the CREB/ATF ( Tax-M47 ) or the NF- « B/Rel ( Tax-M22 ) transcription factor pathway ( 68 ) .
As shown in Fig .

Inhibition of proteasome activity in HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes leads to the accumulation of IxBa but not IBB .
( A ) The HTLV-l-infected T-cell lines C8166 ( upper panel ) and MT-4 ( lower panel ) were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( 100 M ) for the indicated periods of time .
Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with peptide-specific IxBa antisera ( lanes 2 to 5 ) .
Equivalent amounts of cytoplasmic protein from Jurkat T cells were analyzed in parallel ( lane 1 ) as a control for basal levels of IxBa expression in uninfected T lymphocytes .
Major immunoreactive IxB species are indicated .

Control experiments performed with equivalent amounts of Jurkat T cell extracts are shown in lane 1. to control transfectants ( lane 1 ) .
These stimulatory effects were dependent on the NF- « B-inducing function of Tax , since Tax-M22 failed to enhance IxBa mRNA expression ( lane 3 ) .

subunit ( lane 3 ) , which lacks a transcriptional activation domain ( 6 , 58 , 63 ) .
These results confirmed that the NF- « kB-inducing activity of Tax accounts for the high-level expression of IxBa mRNA in HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes .
Furthermore , these findings establish a strong correlation between the chronic downregulation of IxBB protein expression and the failure of Tax to induce IkxBB gene transcription in virus-infected cells .
DISCUSSION The Tax protein of HTLV-1 is a potent transcriptional activator with demonstrated oncogenic potential ( 31 , 50 , 55 , 69 , 70 , 75 ) .
This transforming protein has the capacity to activate the functional expression of various members of the NF- « B/ Rel family of transcription factors ( 5 , 44 , 59 ) .
Recent studies with mice transgenic for the tax gene suggest that the constitutive pattern of NF- « B induced in HTLV-1-infected cells is required to maintain the transformed phenotype ( 40 ) .
We have focused on defining how Tax subverts the action of NF- « B in CD4* T lymphocytes , the in vivo target for HTLV-1-induced transformation .
Insights into the precise nature of this virus-host interaction have been complicated by the capacity of Tax to assemble with multiple components of the NF-kB pathway ( 10 , 32 , 33 , 81 ) .
However , recent experiments have revealed a direct mechanistic link between the abilities of Tax to activate NF-kB and to stimulate degradation of IxBa by the 268 proteasome ( 13 , 62 ) .
We demonstrate here that Tax also induces proteasome-dependent degradation of IxBB , a recently cloned member of the IxB family of NF- « B inhibitors ( 77 ) .
Thus , Tax mobilizes not one but two distinct pools of cytoplasmic NF-complexes to the nucleus .
The dual specificity of Tax for IxBa and IxBB likely contributes to the mechanism by which HTLV-1 deregulates the expression of growth-related genes under NF-kB control ( 5 , 19 , 27 , 39 , 44 , 59 ) .
During a normal immune response , IxBa « is rapidly phosphorylated and then completely degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 62 , 78 , 79 ) .
Recent studies have suggested that signal-dependent phosphorylation of IxBa at serines 32 and 36 is a prerequisite for proteolytic breakdown ( 16 ) .
Two lines of experimental evidence indicate that a related posttranslational process leads to Tax-mediated inactivation of IxBa and IxBB by the proteasome .
First , treatment of T-cell transfectants with MG132 , a peptide aldehyde inhibitor of the proteasome , blocks Tax-induced breakdown of both IxBa ( 13 ) and IxBB ( Fig .
2C ) .
Degradation of IBB in Tax-expressing cells was also prevented by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin ( Fig .
2D ) , which exhibits a more restricted range of action and has no detectable effect on calpain or cathepsin B ( 21 ) .
Second , by analogy with IxBa ( 13 ) , disruption of two conserved serine residues positioned within the amino terminus of IxBB yields a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF- « B that is resistant to proteolytic breakdown in the presence of Tax ( Fig .
3 ) .
Taken together , these findings suggest that HTLV-1 Tax mimics extracellular immune signals which target IxB proteins to the proteasome , including those mediated by cytokine and antigen receptors ( 13 , 14 , 16 , 62 , 78 , 79 ) .
The mechanism by which Tax accesses these host signaling pathways for IxB inactivation remains elusive .
Given the recent finding that Tax forms stable complexes with IxBa when overexpressed in vivo ( 33 , 74 ) , it is possible that this viral protein initiates the process of NF- « B induction by physically dissociating IxB proteins from latent cytoplasmic complexes .
Indeed , since free IxBa is rapidly degraded ( 73 ) , this model could potentially explain the mechanism by which Tax stimulates IxB turnover .
However , we have observed that the Tax Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
M22 mutant , which is defective for NF-kB induction ( 68 ) and IxBa breakdown ( 13 ) , retains the capacity to bind IxBa in transfected cells .
In addition wild-type Tax is fully competent to form stable complexes with dominant-negative forms of IxBa that escape from Tax-dependent proteolysis in vivo ( data not shown ) .
Assuming the interaction is physiologically rele-vant , these findings suggest that Tax binding to IxBa is not sufficient to target the inhibitor to the proteasome .
An alternative view is that Tax regulates the turnover of IxB proteins by influencing the phosphorylation status of serine residues positioned within their N-terminal regions .
In light of emerging evidence that Tax and immune activation signals converge on the same phosphoryl group acceptors within IB ( 13 , 14 , 78 ) , this coupling mechanism may involve the action of a common protein kinase ( s ) .
Consistent with this proposal , antioxi-dants that prevent signal-dependent phosphorylation of IxBa in response to normal physiologic cues also inhibit Tax-mediated induction of NF-kB ( 64 , 65 , 79 ) .
However , we can not exclude the possibility that this modification step is dependent on the formation of IxB-Tax complexes .
Despite the destabilizing effects of Tax on both IxBa and IxBB at the protein level , this viral pathway for NF- « B activation diverges downstream of IxB degradation at the transcription level , resulting in NF- « B-directed synthesis of IxBa but not IBB ( Fig .
6 ) .
In HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes , the capacity of Tax to inactivate IxBB without stimulating transcription of the corresponding gene culminates in the chronic downregulation of IxBB protein expression .
In contrast , the cytoplasmic pool of IxBa « is maintained by de novo protein synthesis in response to NF-KB activation ( Fig .
4 and 5 ) .
This pattern of IxB expression , coupled with the tonic inducing action of HTLV-1 Tax , may account for the persistent NF- « B response in virally infected cells .
In this regard , Thompson et al .
recently reported that IxBfB inactivation is tightly associated with nonviral agents that induce a persistent NF-kB response , such as LPS and IL-1 ( 77 ) .
In cells treated with either of these extracellular inducers , both IxBa and IxBB are rapidly de-graded , but only IxBa reaccumulates in the cytoplasm following NF-kB induction .
In contrast , IxBa appears to be selectively degraded in cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha or phorbol esters , both of which elicit a transient NF- « B response ( 77 ) .
These findings collectively suggest that IxBB plays a significant role in regulating the duration of NF-kB activity in the nuclear compartment .
Why might inactivation of IxBB be required for the development of a chronic NF-kB response ?
One possibility is that IxBB-bound NF- « B is uniquely endowed for persistent nuclear expression .
For example , following its release from IBB , NF- « B may be refractory to postinduction repression mediated by newly synthesized IxBa ( 22 , 77 ) .
Alternatively , the findings presented here may reflect the requirement for a threshold level of cytoplasmic IxB to fully inhibit NF- « B .
While IxB expression is downregulated in HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes , the concentration of certain Rel subunits is elevated as a result of NF- « B-directed transcription of the corresponding genes ( 37 , 72 , 76 ) .
As a consequence of this stoichiometric imbal-ance , the total intracellular concentration of IxB may be insufficient to sequester NF- « B in the cytoplasmic compartment of Tax-expressing cells .
The proteasome is rapidly emerging as a key regulator of transcription factors involved in the control of normal cellular growth .
In addition to IB proteins ( 22 ) , proteasome-dependent turnover of the c-jun proto-oncogene product appears to play a pivotal role in governing its transcriptional activity ( 80 ) .
Furthermore , recent studies suggest that human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 promote cellular transformation by stim- Vou .
16 , 1996 ulating proteasome-mediated breakdown of the p53 tumor suppressor ( 61 ) .
It is now evident that HTLV-1 also employs the proteasome to constitutively activate NF-kB in CD4* T lymphocytes , resulting in the abnormal expression of select genes involved in growth-signal transduction ( 27 ) .
Our prior findings ( 13 , 62 ) and the results presented here suggest that this mechanism involves the unique capacity of the HTLV-1 Tax protein to convert both IxBa and IxBB into labile proteasome substrates .
Future studies to define precisely how Tax executes this IxB targeting function may illuminate novel strategies for therapeutic control of HTLV-1-associated diseases .
