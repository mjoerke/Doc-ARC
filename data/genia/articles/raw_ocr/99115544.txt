Involvement of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Pathways in Interleukin-8 Production by Human Monocytes and Polymorphonuclear Cells Stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide or Mycoplasma fermentans Membrane Lipoproteins CHRISTELLE MARIE , SERGIO ROMAN-ROMAN , '' anp GEORGES RAWADP* Unité d 'Immuno-Allergie ' and Département de Bactériologie et de Mycologie , Laboratoire des Mycoplasmes , '' Paris 75724 Cedex 15 , and Centre de Recherche Romainville , Hoechst-Marion-Roussel , 93230 Romainville Cedex , '' France Received 27 October 1998/Accepted 19 November 1998 Interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) is a chemokine that belongs to the « -chemokine or CXC subfamily and is produced by a wide variety of human cells , including monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells ( PMN ) .
IL-8 is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli , notably bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , but little is known about the mechanisms by which these agents mediate IL-8 induction .
In this report , we show that Mycoplasma fermentans lipid-associated membrane proteins ( LAMPF ) induce the production of high levels of IL-8 by THP-1 ( human monocyte ) cells and PMN at the same extent as LPS .
It was previously demonstrated that stimulation of monocytic cells with either LPS or LAMPF led to a series of common downstream signaling events , including the activation of protein tyrosine kinase and of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades .
By using PD-98059 and $ B203580 , two potent and selective inhibitors of MEK1 ( a kinase upstream of ERK1/2 ) and p38 , respectively , we have demonstrated that both ERK1/2 and p38 cascades play a key role in the production of IL-8 by monocytes and PMN stimulated with bacterial fractions .
Chemokines are proinflammatory cytokines that exhibit chemotactic and stimulatory activity toward blood cells ( 4 ) .
Interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) is the best-characterized member of the « -chemokine or CXC subfamily ( 2 , 32 ) .
IL-8 acts primarily on polymorphonuclear cells ( PMN ) but also has potent chemotactic and stimulatory effects on T cells , basophils , or eosino-phils ( 2 ) .
IL-8 is released by a wide variety of cell types , including monocytes/macrophages , neutrophils , T lymphocytes , fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and epithelial cells upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , or tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) ( 22 , 23 , 46 ) .
Besides its central role in inflammation process , IL-8 is involved in other biological functions such as angiogenesis ( 13 ) and hematopoiesis ( 8 ) .
IL-8 has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of various diseases , including rheumatoid ar-thritis , psoriasis , asthma , pancreatitis , acute respiratory distress syndrome , and sepsis ( 39 ) , and its level in plasma or in inflammatory biological fluids is often correlated with the severity of the pathology and/or the outcome of the patients ( 19 , 21 ) .
Mycoplasma fermentans is a potent human pathogen that is suspected to be involved in rheumatoid arthritis .
Unlike all the other bacteria , mycoplasmas have no cell wall , and consequently their bilipid membrane is the only structure that regulates the interaction with the external environment .
One of the responses of the human macrophages to gram-negative bacterial LPS or to M. fermentans lipid-associated membrane proteins ( LAMPf ) is the production of proinflammatory cyto- * Corresponding author .

Although the mechanisms by which LPS and LAMPf induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines are not completely eluci-dated , it has been demonstrated that signaling pathways involving protein kinases clearly participate in this processus ( 16 , 27 , 33 ) .
Whereas LPS from distinct gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli , Neisseria meningitidis , and Klebsiella pneumoniae have been shown to be potent inducers of IL-8 production in monocytic cells and PMN ( 9 ) , the ability of M. fermentans lipoproteins to induce IL-8 secretion by these cells has not been addressed .
In this study , we have tested and compared the abilities of LAMPf and £ .
coli ( 055 : B5 ) LPS to induce IL-8 production by the human promyelomonocytic cell line THP-1 , human monocytes/macrophages , and PMN .
Furthermore , we have evaluated the role that mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways play in the IL-8 production induced by these bacterial products .

The endotoxin level of the preparations was < 60 pg/ml , as determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay ( Haemachem , St. Louis , Mo . ) .
THP-1 cell line culture and stimulation .
The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was cultured ( 37°C , 5 % CO ; ) in RPMI 1640 culture medium ( Gibco BRL ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 mM 1-glutamine , and antibiotics .
Cell line were tested every 2 weeks by a PCR-based detection assay for mycoplasma contamination ( 26 ) .
For stimulation experiments , cells were seeded at a density of 105/ml and then incubated overnight .
For cytokine production , cells were stimulated with LAMPF ( 1 pg/ml ! )
or LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) for 18 h. Isolation of human monocytes and PMN .
Fresh human blood was obtained from healthy donors ( Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine de Assistance Publique , Paris , France ) and drawn on citrate-phosphate-dextrose .
Human monocytes were selected by adherence from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) as previously described ( 24 ) .
Briefly , 1:2-diluted blood in RPMI 1640 medium ( Glutamax ; Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) was layered on Ficoll-Hypaque ( MSL ; Eurobio , Les Ulis , France ) .
The ratio was 2 volumes of blood to 1 volume of MSL .
After centrifugation for 20 min at 15°C and 600 x g , PBMC were washed twice and then counted in 0.1 % eosin .
PMN were prepared as previously described ( 20 ) .
Briefly , 10 volumes of blood was mixed with 2 volumes of glucose dextran ( 3 % glucose , 3 % dextran T250 ; Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) , and the leukocytes were recovered following a 40-min sedimentation at room temperature .
The leukocytes were then diluted 1:2 in RPMI 1640 medium and layered on Ficoll-Hypaque .
After centrifugation for 20 min at 15°C and 600 x g , the cell pellet was washed and centrifuged once for 5 min at 300 x g. Contaminating erythrocytes were lysed , and the viability of PMN was assessed by counting the cells in 0.1 % eosin .
Monocytes and PMN culture and stimulation .
PBMC were adjusted to 6 X 10° cells per ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics ( penicillin [ 100 TU/m ! ]
and streptomycin [ 100 pg/ml ) ; 0.5-ml aliquots of PBMC suspension per well were incubated in a 5 % CO ; incubator in 24-well multidish plates ( Costar , Cambridge , Mass . )
for 1 h at 37°C .
The nonadherent cells were then discarded , and the remaining adherent cells were washed extensively ; 0.5 ml of fresh medium ( RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 0.2 % heat-inac-tivated normal human serum ) was added , and monocytes were further cultured for 24 h at 37°C and 5 % CO ; .
At 24 h , the adherent monocytes/macrophages were washed again and cultured for another 24-h period in 0.5 ml of fresh medium .
At 48 h , cells were washed and then incubated for 24 h with stimulating agents .
PMN were adjusted to 2 X 10 % /ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 5 % normal human serum .
Then 0.5-ml aliquots of PMN suspension per well were incubated in 24-well multidish plates in a 5 % CO ; incubator for 24 h at 37°C with stimulating agents .
Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) was used as the solvent control .
RNA purification and NPA .
THP-1 cells were stimulated as described above at various times , and total RNA was extracted from 10 '' cells by using a total RNA isolation kit from Bioprobe ( Montreuil , France ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Nuclease protection assay ( NPA ) for the detection of IL-8 transcript was performed with a Multi-NPA kit ( Ambion , Austin , Tex . )
as instructed by the manufacturer , using an IL-8 oligonucleotide probe ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif. ) and a 28S rRNA oligonucleotide probe ( Ambion ) for standardization .
NPA gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen , and the signals were quantified with ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
All determinations were repeated three to four times ; data are presented as means + standard errors of the means ( SEM ) .
Plasmids , cell transfection , activation , and assay for luciferase activity .
The NF- « B-driven and AP-1-driven ( 3 ) luciferase reporter constructs were kindly provide by O. Acuto ( Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) .
THP-1 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by electroporation as described by Stacey et al .
( 38 ) .
Transfected cells were cultured overnight in growth medium and then either left unstimulated or stimulated with LAMPf or LPS for 6 h. Cells were then harvested , the protein concentration was determined by micro-BCA assay ( Pierce ) , and luciferase activity was measured as described elsewhere ( 5 ) .
Specific luciferase activity , determined in duplicate samples by using an automated luminometer ( Lumat LB 9501 ; EG1G Berthod , Wilbad , Germany ) , was determined in arbitrary units after normalization to the protein content .
Luciferase fold induction was calculated as the ratio of specific luciferase activity in the stimulated cells to that in the unstimulated cells .
Cytokine ELISA .
IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) was performed as previously described ( 21 ) , using a monoclonal anti-human antibody obtained by J. C. Mazié ( Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-8 antibody graciously provided by N. Vita ( Sanofi Recherche , Labége , France ) .
RESULTS LAMPF induces IL-8 secretion by THP-1 cells , human monocytes/macrophages , and human PMN .
Mycoplasma membrane lipoproteins have been demonstrated to strongly stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines by human monocytic cells ( 28 , 29 ) ; however , their ability to induce IL-8 secretion by INVOLVEMENT OF MAPK PATHWAYS IN IL-8 PRODUCTION - 689 > w 100 LAMPE _ 0 2h 4h 6h Sh g 10 E 3 9 P a `` of 0,01 C WWW “ I sumone Perentage of IL-8 production normalized to control levels LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) LAMP Cugat FIG .

( A ) THP-1 cells ( 10 % /ml ) were not stimulated ( control [ CTRL ] ) or stimulated with either LPS ( 1 pg/ml ) or LAMPF ( 1 pg/ml ) .
IL-8 production was measured by ELISA 18 h after stimulation .
Data presented are means + SEM of three distinct assays .
( B ) Multi-NPA using oligonucleotide probes for IL-8 and 28S rRNA ( for standardization ) .
RNAs were prepared from untreated THP-1 cells ( 0 ) and THP-1 cells induced with LAMPf ( 1 g/m ! )
for the indicated time and subjected to multi-NPA analysis .
Multi-NPA gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 2 to 4 h ; the gel shown is representative of three experiments with similar results .
IL-8 and 288 rRNA oligonucleotide probes protect 24 and 35 bases of the IL-8 and 288 rRNA transcripts , respectively .
The IL-8 signal in each lane was quantitatively assessed and normalized to the 28 $ rRNA signal .
( C ) Effect of anti-CD14 antibody treatments on LAMPF-induced IL-8 secretion .
Human THP-1 cells were incubated with anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibody MY4 at 5 pg/ml for 1 h prior to stimulation with either LAMPf ( 1 g/m ! )
or LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) .
An irrelevant antibody ( NS ) was used as a control .
IL-8 secretion was determined after 18 h of culture and expressed as percentage of secretion normalized to stimulated cells that received no antibody treatment .
Mean values of two different experiments are shown .
these cells has not been previously addressed .
As shown in Fig .
1A , Triton X-114 fractionated LAMPf ( 1 pg/ml ) induced the release of a considerable amount of IL-8 by THP cells after 18 h of stimulation .
It is worth noting that the level of IL-8 in THP-1 cells stimulated with LAMPf was comparable to that induced in response to LPS ( Fig .
1A ) .
We further investigated the expression of IL-8 mRNA in THP-1 cells challenged with LAMPf by multi-NPA .
As depicted in Fig .
1B , LAMPf induced the synthesis of IL-8 mRNA 2 h after stimulation , and the mRNA level increased continuously up to 8 h after stimulation .
The amount of RNA in each incubation time was normalized by probing for 28S rRNA .
Quantitative analysis demonstrated that at 8 h poststimulation , the IL-8 signal in LAMPf-stimu-lated cells , after correction by the 288 rRNA signal , was 1,033 % of the IL-8 signal in control cells .
Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with LPS ( data not shown ) .

IL-8 production by human monocytes and PMN stimulated with LAMPf or LPS .
PBMC ( 6 x 10 % /ml ) and PMN ( 2 X 10 % /ml ) were unstimulated ( control [ CTRL ] ) or stimulated with either LPS ( 1 pg/ml ) or LAMPF ( 1 pg/ml ) .
IL-8 production was measured by ELISA 18 h after stimulation .
Data presented are means + SEM of four and five distinct assays for monocytes and PMN , respectively .
Treatment of LAMPf with polymyxin B ( 1,000 U/ml ) had no effect on the IL-8 induction mediated by LAMPf , whereas polymyxin B completely blocked LPS-induced IL-8 in the same cells ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , the anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody MY4 , which significantly reduced LPS-induced IL-8 production by THP -1 cells , had no effect on IL-8 secretion by the same cells stimulated with LAMPf ( Fig .
1C ) .
We also assessed the production of IL-8 by human monocytes/macrophages and PMN challenged with LAMPf .
As shown in Fig .
2 , LAMPf induced IL-8 secretion by human monocytes/macrophages after 24 h of stimulation .
Culture conditions and stimulation of human monocytes/macrophages had to be adjusted in order to reduce the amount of spontaneous IL-8 release by these cells .
In contrast , with the very low levels of IL-8 secreted by unstimulated THP -1 cells , a large amount of this chemokine was detected in the supernatants of 24-h-cultured human monocytes/macrophages in the absence of any stimulus .
However , spontaneous IL-8 release was dramatically reduced ( 80 % reduction ) when cells were cultured for 48 h prior to stimulation and washed each 24 h ( data not shown ) .
In these conditions , LAMPf stimulation induced a 100-fold increase in IL-8 secretion in comparison to unstimulated cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Given that PMN constitute excellent producers of IL-8 , we also tested the effect of mycoplasma lipoproteins on the secretion of this chemokine .
LAMPf increased strongly ( 100-fold ) the release of IL-8 by PMN ( Fig .
2 ) .
Interestingly , the levels of induction of IL-8 secretion by cells stimulated with either £ .
coli LPS ( 1 pg/ml ) or LAMPf were fully comparable .
Tyrosine phosphorylation is required for IL-8 induction by LAMPf and LPS .
Stimulation of monocytic cells with either LAMPf or LPS results in the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of a series of unidentified proteins .
The activation of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) in monocytes in response to LPS or LAMPf seems to be maximal at 10 or 20 min , respectively , after stimulation ( 27 , 28 ) .
Furthermore , tyrosine phosphorylation constitutes a crucial event in the signaling pathways leading to IL-1 B , TNF- « , and IL-6 production by monocytes/macrophages stimulated with either LPS or LAMPf ( 12 , 28 ) .
To evaluate the involvement of PTK in IL-8 production by human monocytes/macrophages and PMN stimulated with LAMPf , we used the specific PTK inhibitor herbimycin A .
Prior to stimulation , human monocytes/macrophages or PMN were incubated for 1 h with herbimycin A at 10 wM ( a con INFECT .
ImMUN .
centration that does not affect cell viability ) , and IL-8 production was monitored by specific ELISA after 24 h of stimulation .
As shown in Fig .
3 , herbimycin A completely inhibited IL-8 production in response to LAMPf .
Herbimycin A at 10 mM also completely blocked IL-8 production in response to LPS .
These data clearly underscore the involvement of PTK in the signaling cascades leading to IL-8 production by monocytes/ macrophages and PMN in response to both LAMPf and bacterial LPS .
MAPK signaling is a key event in IL-8 induction by LAMPf and LPS .
MAPKs are a group of serine/threonine-specific , proline-directed protein kinases which are activated by various extracellular stimuli .
Well-characterized MAPK pathways include extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1/2 ) , c-Jun NH , -terminal kinase ( JNK ) /stress-activated protein ki-nases , and p38/RK/Mpk2 ( 40 ) .
LPS and LAMPf are capable of activating ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in monocytes/macrophages , although with different kinetics of activation ( 27 , 33 ) .
To determine the involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in LAMP { - and LPS-induced IL-8 production in monocytes/macrophages and PMN , we used two specific inhibitors : PD-98059 , which targets the upstream effector of ERK1/2 MEKI1 ( 1 , 11 ) ; and $ B203580 , which inhibits p38 kinase ( 16 ) .
Treatment of monocytes with $ B203580 selectively inhibited the LAMPf-mediated activation of p38 without significantly affecting the stimulation of ERK1/2 or JNK ( data not shown ) .
Human monocytes/macrophages were preincubated for 1 h with various concentrations of S $ B203580 before stimulation .
As depicted in Fig .
4A , p38 pathway inhibitor significantly reduced IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner in response to LAMPf .
Furthermore , $ B203580 also inhibited IL-8 production when cells were stimulated with LPS ( Fig .
4B ) .
Similarly , treatment of PMN with $ B203580 almost completely blocked IL-8 production induced by both agents .
No cell toxicity was observed when cells were treated with $ B203580 at the highest used concentration ( 30 M ) .
These data underscore the involvement of p38 pathway in signaling for IL-8 production in both human monocytes/macrophages and PMN .

DMSO ( 1 % ) was used as the solvent control .
The IL-8 level was measured by ELISA 18 h after stimulation and normalized to cells that received no treatment prior to stimulation .
Results are means + SEM of four and three separate experiments for monocytes and PMN , respectively .
The MEK-1 inhibitor , PD-98059 , selectively inhibited the or LPS-mediated activation of ERK1/2 in macrophages without significantly affecting the stimulation of p38 or JNK , and no cell toxicity was observed with this compound up to a concentration of 30 uM ( data not shown ) .
Treatment of human monocytes/macrophages with PD-98059 significantly decreased IL-8 production in a concentration-dependent manner in cells stimulated with LAMPf ( Fig .
4A ) .
In addition , PD-98059 treatment strongly reduced IL-8 production in human monocytes/macrophages challenged with LPS ( Fig .
4B ) .
Inhibition of MEK-1 in PMN resulted in a significant decrease in IL-8 production after both LAMPf and LPS challenge .
As depicted in Fig .
4 , PMN were found overall to be more sensitive than monocytes/macrophages to treatment with either PD-98059 or $ B203580 .
Altogether , these data clearly indicate the importance of MAPK pathways in the signaling leading to IL-8 induction in response to both LAMPf and E. coli LPS .
INVOLVEMENT OF MAPK PATHWAYS IN IL-8 PRODUCTION - 691 Involvement of NF-KB in IL-8 production in monocytes/macrophages and PMN .
NF- « B is involved in the inflammation response ( 43 ) .
It is well documented that LPS induces NF- « B activation in monocytes and regulates cytokine expression ( 10 , 43 , 44 ) .
We have recently shown that LAMPf induce the activation of NF-kB in monocytic cells ( 292 ) .
We therefore addressed the involvement of NF-kB in IL-8 production by LAMP { - and LPS-stimulated monocytes/macrophages and PMN .
To investigate the involvement of NF- « B activation in IL-8 production induced by these bacterial stimuli , we used the recently reported specific NF-kB inhibitor CAPE ( 25 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5 , LAMPf induced a threefold increase in luciferase activity in THP-1 cells transiently transfected with NF-xB-driven luciferase reporter plasmid .
In addition , LAMPf was capable of inducing AP-1 transactivation , as determined by measuring luciferase activity in THP-1 cells transiently transfected with AP-1-driven luciferase reporter plasmid and stimulated with LAMPf ( Fig .
5 ) .
Treatment of THP transfected cells with CAPE ( 10 to 100 wM ) inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner NF- « B-mediated luciferase activation induced by LAMPf ( Fig .
5 ) .
No cell toxicity was observed with CAPE at 100 mM , as determined by the blue trypan uptake ; at higher concentration , however , this inhibitor induced cell death ( > 50 % ) .
Importantly , at 100 wM CAPE completely blocked NF- « kB-dependent luciferase activation but affect neither AP-1-dependent ( Fig .
5 ) nor c-fos promoter-dependent ( data not shown ) luciferase activity in transfected THP-1 cells , indicating the specificity of this compound at the effective in-hibitory concentration .
Human monocytes/macrophages or PMN were preincubated for 1 h with CAPE at 100 pM before being challenged with either LAMPf or LPS ; IL-8 production was determined in cell supernatants after 24 h of stimulation and compared to that in cells preincubated with the solvent ( DMSO ) for 1 h prior to stimulation as a control .
As shown in Fig .
6 , CAPE strongly inhibited the production of IL-8 by either human monocytes/ macrophages or PMN challenged with either LAMPf or LPS .
These data underscore the involvement of NF-KB activation in IL-8 production by monocytes/macrophages and PMN in response to two different bacterial stimuli .

DISCUSSION Given that IL-8 can play an major role in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases , it is important to elucidate the mechanisms by which the IL-8-inducers act on cells to activate the production of this chemokine .
LPS is largely known to induce different cell types to secrete large amounts of IL-8 ( 2 ) .
In the present report , we have demonstrated the ability of another bacterial product , LAMPf , to induce IL-8 production by human monocytes/macrophages and PMN .
The finding is helpful to more clearly understand the pathogenic mechanisms of M. fermentans , a microorganism suspected to play a role in several human inflammatory diseases , particularly rheumatoid arthritis ( 34 , 41 ) .
This is not the first study reporting the ability of mycoplasmas to induce IL-8 secretion .
M. hominis and M. salivarium recently have been shown to induce IL-8 production by human alveolar type II cells ( 15 ) and human gingival fibroblasts ( 37 ) , respectively .
Interestingly , the soluble protein fraction of M. salivarium was found to be the active fraction in the second study ( 37 ) .
This is unusual because we previously demonstrated that only Triton X-114-fractionated membrane proteins from different Mycoplasma species , including M. salivarium , were capable of inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1B , TNF- « , and IL-6 ) by monocytic cells ( 28 ) .
Therefore , one can speculate that Mycoplasma species stimulate different cellular types by mechanisms involving distinct triggering molecular entities .
We and others have previously demonstrated that M. fermentans lipoproteins induce monocyte activation by mechanisms distinct from that of LPS ( 14 , 28 ) .
Previous studies have shown that mycoplasma membrane lipoproteins do not stimulate monocytic cells via CD14 .
Unlike LPS , anti-CD14 antibodies have been shown to be inefficient in blocking the effects of mycoplasma lipoproteins on monocytic cells ( 14 , 27 ) .
The secretion of IL-8 mediated by LAMPf seems also to be independent of CD14 , given that anti-CD14 antibodies had no effect on this LAMPf activity ( Fig .
1C ) .
Although LAMPFf and LPS seem to activate monocytes through distinct cellular membrane receptors , the signaling triggered by both agents converts to the activation of MAPK cascades .
MAPK pathways have been demonstrated to play an important role in the control of proinflammatory cytokine induction mediated by both INFECT .
ImMUN .
LPS and LAMPFf ( 27 , 33 ) .
Whereas the p38 pathway is crucial in the signaling leading to IL-1B , TNF- « , and IL-6 secretion in macrophages stimulated with LAMPf , ERK1/2 is involved in signaling for synthesis of IL-1B and TNF-a but not IL-6 ( 27 ) .
In the present study , we investigated the involvement of ERK1/ 2 and p38 pathways in IL-8 regulation in both human monocytes/macrophages and PMN stimulated with either LPS or LAMPf .
Two inhibitors , PD-98059 and $ B203580 , that selectively inhibit ERK1/2 and p38 pathways , respectively , were used to address this issue .
Data presented herein clearly show that both pathways are involved in IL-8 regulation in human monocytes/macrophages and PMN .
The p38 inhibitor , $ B203580 , efficiently blocked IL-8 production in both cell types in response to either LAMPf or LPS , whereas slight distinct efficiency between monocytes/macrophages and PMN was observed with the ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor , PD-98059 .
Actually , treatment of human monocytes/macrophages with 30 LM PD-98059 inhibited about 60 % of IL-8 in response to LPS or LAMPf , whereas this inhibitor at the same concentration almost completely blocked IL-8 production by PMN in response to these stimuli .
These data strongly suggest that ERK1/2 is involved in IL-8 regulation in both monocytes/macrophages and PMN but to different extents .
Two distinct studies have previously addressed the involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in IL-8 production by human fibro-blasts .
In concordance with the results presented herein , Bruder and Kovesdi recently demonstrated that the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in the expression of IL-8 in response to adenovirus ( 7 ) .
In contrast with our data , Ridley et al .
found that IL-8 production by human fibroblast in response to IL-1 was independent of activation of the p38 pathway ( 30 ) .
These apparently contradictory results suggest that IL-8 regulation varies from one cell type to another and/or depends on the stimulating agent .
Both LAMPf and LPS induce the activation of NF-kB , a transcription factor known to regulate the expression of a number of cytokine genes ( 17 , 36 , 45 ) .
Brasier et al .
recently demonstrated by using an agent that blocks both IxB proteolysis and NF-kB translocation that NF-kB plays an important role in the induction of IL-8 by TNF-a in A549 alveolar cells ( 6 ) .
In the present report , we have also shown the involvement of NF-kB in IL-8 production by monocytes/macrophages in response to LAMPf or LPS by using the recently described new NF-kB inhibitor CAPE .
The ability of some bacteria to induce IL-8 can be considered a virulence mechanism .
Segal et al .
( 35 ) recently showed that the presence of a pathogenicity island in Helicobacter pylori correlates with the ability of type I strains to induce IL-8 in host cells .
Therefore , type I H. pylori associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer induces IL-8 in gastric epithelial cells , whereas type II strains , more often associated with asymptomatic gastritis , do not ( 35 ) .
Investigation of the mechanisms involved in the induction of the host cell response to different bacteria will provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical response to these microorganisms .
Although our findings remain to be tested in in vivo models , they may be informative with respect to pathologies in which excessive bacterium-induced IL-8 secretion plays a major role in the development of the disease .
