Given their well-known inhibitory effects on lymphoid tissue , glucocorticoids have been used widely in the treatment of leukemia .
Given these facts , over the last 10 years , several investigators have measured the number of glucocorticoid receptors in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue to see whether their number correlated with glucocorticoid responsiveness in vitro or in vivo .
No clear correlation could be established between the level of glucocorticoid receptor and the in vitro action of steroids in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue .
In contrast , attempts to correlate glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphocytic leukemia to in vivo steroid responsiveness and immunological type using the whole-cell-binding assay for receptor determination and selecting the patients according to age and immunological criteria have been more successful .
Introduction It has been known for a long time that glucocorticoids exert many physiological and pharmacological effects on mammalian lymphoid tissues .
in vivo administration of corticosteroids or adrenalectomy has been shown to induce marked changes in the size of lymphoid organs as well as in lymphocyte circulation and to alter many immunological reactions ( 11 ) .
in vitro , glucocorticoids are generally considered as catabolic agents that induce an inhibition of membrane transport and macromolecular synthesis leading to an arrest of cell growth , sometimes accompanied by cell lysis ( 54 ) .
These compounds are also able to modify several immunological functions in vitro ( 1 ) .
These widespread effects on lymphoid cell metabolism and function constitute the basis for the use of glucocorticoid hormones in the treatment of a wide variety of immunological and inflammatory diseases as well as in the treatment of lymphoid cell neoplasias .
According to the classical mechanism of steroid hormone action , which includes a preliminary step of interaction of the steroid with cytoplasmic receptors ( 53 ) , numerous studies have been devoted to the question of whether or not the receptor content of lymphoid cells may be representative of the in vitro or in vivo sensitivity .
The different methods used to measure steroid receptor levels as well as in vitro and in vivo sensitivity are listed in Table 1. !
Part of this work was supported by Grant 76-7-1669 from DGRST , by Grant 58-78-90 from INSERM , and by the National Cancer Institute-INSERM Collaborative Agreement on Hormonal Regulation and Cancer ( 1976/1977 ) .

FEBRUARY 1984 This paper presents a critical review of GR determination as an index of steroid sensitivity in normal and leukemic human lymphoid tissue .
Normal human lymphoid cells Aithough many studies have attempted to determine the effects of glucocorticoids on leukemic lymphoid tissues , only a few have actually related the extent of steroid action in normal human lymphoid cells to the level of GR .
As shown in Table 2 , the number of GR was determined by whole-cell assay in children 's thymocytes and bone marrow as well as in adult blood and lymph node lymphocytes in a number of studies ( 5 , 13 , 31 , 32 , 36 , 43 , 46 , 56 , 58 , 63 , 70 ) .
It is apparent that the number of binding sites found in blood lymphocytes is very similar in the various reports and ranged from 3 to 7000 sites per cell with a K , of around 107° m. No significant difference could be seen between normal T- and B-cells , but it has been suggested that T-cells are heterogeneous with respect to their quantity of GR ( 17 ) .
On the other hand , the number of receptors measured in either human thymus cells or lymph node lymphocytes was comparable to that of blood lymphocytes .
In contrast , GR levels in normal bone marrow were 3 to 5 times higher than in other lymphoid tissues ( 13 ) .
Monocyte depletion prior to the determination of blood lymphocyte receptors appeared to be necessary , since monocytes contain approximately 2 times more receptors than lymphocytes ( 17 , 46 ) .
if we consider the effect of steroids on cell viability , it appears that human lymphoid cells are extremely resistant to them when compared to rodent lymphoid cells .
Mouse thymocytes undergo a 50 % cell lysis after 6 hr incubation in the presence of 10~° m dexamethasone ( 12 , 34 ) , whereas human lymphocytes are not killed even during longer incubation ( Table 3 ) ( 5 , 26 , 65 ) .
In contrast , when another method to determine steroid action in vitro , ie. , its effect on nucleoside incorporation into RNA and DNA , is used , it is apparent that the glucocorticoid effect can be very different from one cell population to another ( Table 3 ) .
Human thymocytes appeared to be extremely sensitive to the inhibitory action of steroids ( 32 ) , whereas peripheral and lymph node lymphocytes were less affected ( 5 , 36 ) .
These differences observed between thymocytes and peripheral lymphocytes are probably related to the stage of cell proliferation .
Claman ( 11 ) postulated that the in vivo shrinkage of the infant thymus after hydrocortisone administration could be explained in terms of growth inhibition .
Since the rate of cell division in infants is very high , any agent which blocks cell proliferation without changing intrathymic cell death would cause a decrease in thymus size ( 10-12 ) .

F. Homo-Delarche Table 1 Different experimental procedures for the determination of glucocorticoid sensitivity Receptor content Total binding ( cytoplasmic + nuclear ) Nuclear bindi Steroid effect on glucose and amino acid transport Steroid effect on precursor incorporation into proteins , RNA , and DNA Short-term response to glucocorticoids alone ( variation in blast cell count ) Response to combined chemotherapy Achievement of complete remission Duration of complete remission Survival In vitro sensitivity In vivo sensitivity With regard to the in vivo action of glucocorticoids in normal humans , it has been shown that steroids induce in vivo a transient lymphopenia ( 20 ) .
Although both T- and B-lymphocytes are removed from the circulation and sequestered in the bone marrow , there is a proportionally greater depletion of circulatory T-lymphocytes , more precisely of a functionally defined T-cell subpopulation ( 19 , 21 ) .
However , this selective lymphodepletive effect of glucocorticoids could not be explained on the basis of detectable differences in GR levels in the different T-cell subpopulations ( 21 ) .
Neoplastic human lymphoid tissue Glucocorticoids have been used for more than 20 years in the treatment of leukemia , first alone and now as a part of combined chemotherapy ( 4 ) .
It appears , however , that some patients either are resistant to them at the outset or cease to be responsive during the course of the treatment .
Since determination of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancer represents an important element in the therapeutic management of the disease ( 52 ) , similar studies were carried out in cases of leukemia , in order to select in advance the patients who are likely to respond to steroid therapy .
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Ten years ago , Lippman et al .
( 47 ) first presented promising results .
They showed , using a cytosolic assay , that the cells of patients with previously untreated ALL contained high levels of receptors .
These cells were also sensitive to steroid action in vitro as well as in vivo .
They showed also that patients previously treated with corticosteroids who failed to respond to additional treatment had barely detectable levels of receptors .
In addition , the cells of these patients were insensitive to steroids in vitro .
The potential clinical implication of this correlation between receptor content and the in vitro or in vivo response to chemotherapy has prompted several groups to undertake comparable studies .
It soon appeared that , when assayed by the whole-cell method , all peripheral leukocytes isolated from patients with ALL contain specific receptors for glucocorticoids ( Table 4 ) .
The number of binding sites ranged from 1,000 to more than 20,000 ( 8 , 15 , 30 , 33 , 37 , 42 , 49 , 56 , 57 ) .3 The affinities of these °F , .
F. Quddus , S. H. Kauffmann , M. Roper , B. Dowell , J. Pullen , and B. G. Leventhal .
Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) level in pediatric leukemia cells , personal 432 receptors for the steroid were comparable to those determined in normal humans .
It was recently demonstrated that the use of a cytosolic assay instead of the whole-cell assay leads to a marked underestimation of the number of binding sites ( up to 80 % ) ( 38 , 49 ) .
Several reasons may account for this difference , mainly the failure to measure the receptor in the nuclear com-partment , but also the release of proteolytic enzymes that partially inactivate the receptor during cytosol preparation or even the failure to break some cells during homogenization .
It is now widely recognized that ALL is a strongly heterogeneous disease with regard to its clinical and immunological aspects .
Several groups have thus attempted to establish a relationship between the number of receptors and the immunological markers .
It appears that in the childhood form , `` null '' cell leukemia tends to contain more receptors than T-cell leukemia ( 15 , 42 , 57 ) .3 The correlation with the immunological type appeared less striking in adults ( 7 , 36 ) .
Few data are available concerning B-cell lineage , but pre-B-cells have been shown to possess as many receptors as `` null '' cells ( 15 , 57 ) . % In a recent study , GR levels were measured in bone marrow aspirates of 174 children with newly diagnosed ALL ( 13 ) .
Bone marrow samples were selected with more than 90 % of blast cells be-cause , as mentioned above , normal bone marrow exhibits a high level of GR .
The number of binding sites ranged from 2,248 to 79,664 per cell ( median , 18,123 ) and was higher than that reported previously in blood samples .
The authors suggested that this discrepancy may result either from cell storage ( GR are relatively labile ) or from a true difference between blood and bone marrow receptor content .
Extensive comparative studies of GR levels in blood and bone marrow samples need to be performed , to give a definite answer ( 8 , 13 ) .
As in blood , GR content is lower in the bone marrow of T-cell leukemia than in that of common leukemia ( 13 ) .
In studies with a limited number of patients , no significant correlation has been found between GR content of circulating cells and WBC or sex ( 33 , 37 , 42 , 49 ) .
However , after studying a large number of cases , Costlow et al .
related low GR levels in bone marrow to ages < 2 or > 10 years , black race , high leukocyte count , central nervous system dis-ease , and mediastinal mass ; all these parameters are recognized as high-risk features in the diagnosis of leukemia ( 13 ) .
Attempts to correlate the level of GR in ALL with most of the parameters of the in vitro sensitivity were unsuccessful in most of the studies ( 14 , 30 , 33 , 37 , 50 ) .
It may be possible to explain the absence of correlation between the number of receptors and the in vitro effects of steroids by the heterogeneity of the cells .
For this reason , we separated our patients into 2 groups on the basis of the absence or presence of blood cells in the S phase of the cell cycle , using pulse cytophotometry analysis ( 33 ) .
it appeared that the in vitro inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was 2 times higher in the group of patients with cells in S phase than in the group of patients without detectable cells in S phase .
The cytotoxic effect of cortisol was recently studied in different types of ALL defined by monoclonal antibodies and rosettes ( 25 ) .
Lymphoid ceils from 20 patients with common ALL were found to be resistant to cortisol , whereas the cells from 10 patients with pre-B-leukemia were readily lysed .
Cells from 5 patients with `` early '' T-cell leukemia were sensitive , whereas cells from 2 patients with a more mature T-cell phenotype were found to be resistant .
This suggests that the in vitro effect of glucocorticoids in terms of cell lysis may be linked to cell differentiation .

F. Homo-Delarche Antileukemic therapy usually includes , in addition to glucocor-ticoids , 2 or 3 other cytotoxic agents , and it is therefore difficult to ascertain the clinical efficiency of one of these drugs and to relate an in vivo response to the level of GR .
To overcome this difficulty , several groups have attempted to correlate the level of receptors with the short-term response to glucocorticoid therapy .
By selecting the responsive patients on the basis of at least a 50 % decrease in the number of circulating blast cells , the number of receptors appeared to be slightly higher in the sensitive patients ( 8 , 30 , 33 , 37 , 49 ) .
On the other hand , Lippman et al .
( 48 ) were the first to compare in children the levels of receptors at diagnosis before any treatment with long-term combined chemotherapy .
They showed that patients with high receptor levels tend to have `` null '' cell ALL and a long remission duration .
Patients with low receptor levels have T-tymphoblasts and a short remission duration .
Patients with intermediate receptor levels had an intermediate and identical remission duration , regardless of the cell type .
They concluded that GR levels appear to have clinical significance independently of age , WBC , or cell type and may represent a biological marker associated with other factors , which are related to chemotherapy response , such as rate of growth or biochemical differentiation .
More recent studies in children confirmed that low GR levels are associated with earlier and more frequent relapse ( 13 , 31 , 49 ) .
In contrast , GR levels did not correlate with response to combined chemotherapy , duration of remission , or survival in adults ( 8 ) .
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Determinations of GR have now been performed by several groups in more than 100 patients with CLL ( 24 , 31 , 35 , 43 , 56 , 67 , 69 , 71 , 72 , 74 ) .
In the early studies performed by cytosolic assay , the receptors were detected in only one-half to one-third of the patients .
Again , when assayed by whole-cell assay , the presence of glucoceorticoid-binding sites was detected in all cases .
The number of these receptors was on an average similar to or even slightly lower than that measured in normal PBL ( Table 5 ) .
More recently , Ho et al .
( 31 ) have demonstrated that the cells from patients who were treated for 3 to 5 years with a combination of corticoids and chlorambucil and became resistant to this treatment contain lower receptor content than did cells from newly diagnosed patients .
Attempts made to correlate the amount of receptors with in vitro steroid sensitivity were unsuccessful ( 14 , 31 , 35 , 71 ) .
It appears , however , that the extent of dexamethasone-induced inhibition of uridine incorporation was generally more important in cells from CLL patients than in normal PBL and that this in vitro steroid sensitivity increased significantly with the severity Table 5 Number of GR in CLL ( whole-cell assay ) No .

434 of the iliness ( 35 ) .
Similarly , it was shown that CLL lymphocytes , in contrast to normal PBL , were in vitro very sensitive to the cytotoxic action of glucocorticoids ( 26 , 66 ) .
Hairy Cell Leukemia GR were measured by whole-cell assay in leukemic cells from 5 patients with hairy cell leukemia ( 44 ) .
GR sites ranged from 5,710 to 11,400 sites per cell , with a K , of about 107° m. Glucocorticoid sensitivity studied in a cell line derived from one of the patients showed , in fact , a stimulation of DNA synthesis .
Non-Hodgkin 's Malignant Lymphoma Investigations of malignant lymph nodes were carried out in cell suspensions containing at least 50 % malignant cells ( 5-7 ) .
The number of binding sites measured by whole-cell assay varied greatly from one patient to another but was on an average higher in cells from patients with non-Hodgkin 's malignant lymphoma than in cells isolated from control lymph nodes [ median values are 4110 ( n = 42 ) and 2082 ( n = 11 ) sites per cell , respec-tively ] .
In addition , `` null '' cell as in ALL patients , usually contained more receptors than did T-cell Iymphomas .
Finally , sequential investigations ( at diagnosis and at relapse ) showed a decrease of the number of GR after treatment .
Despite the high sensitivity of Iymphoma cells to the cytotoxic action of glucocorticoids in vitro ( almost 50 % of cell lysis after 96 hr incubation in the presence of 4 x 10~ '' m dexamethasone ) , no correlation could be found between the level of these GR and any parameters of in vitro sensitivity .
On the other hand , Bloomfield et al .
( 5 ) have studied in 20 patients the response to therapy with corticosteroids as a single agent .
They showed in the group of responders ( with a 50 % or more decrease in measurable tumor after corticotherapy ) that the number of GR was significantly higher than in nonresponders ( 5600 versus 3300 sites , p < 0.01 , n = 10 , in each group ) .
Thymoma Ranelletti et al .
( 37 , 60 , 61 ) have studied the level of GR in various forms of thymus dysplasia .
Using a cytosolic assay , they showed that the level of specific receptors was significantly higher in Iymphoepithelial thymoma than in pure epithelial form , in thymus hyperplasia , or even in normal thymus .
However , despite this high level of GR , the in vitro sensitivity of thymoma cells to glucosteroids was comparable to that of normal thymus cells either in terms of inhibition of precursor incorporation or in terms of steroid-induced cell lysis .
Sézary Syndrome Schmidt and Thompson ( 64 ) have studied the binding of tritiated dexamethasone in the circulating lymphocytes of 7 patients with Sézary syndrome .
Using a cytosolic assay , they showed the presence of detectable specific receptors in 5 cases .
Although one patient with very high levels of receptors was shown to be dramatically improved by prednisone treatment , whereas one patient with no detectable receptors was refractory to combined chemotherapy , it also appears that 2 patients with nonnegligible levels of receptors were not sensitive to combined chemotherapy including glucocorticoids .
These authors also proposed that the determination of the activity of the steroid CANCER RESEARCH VOL .

inducible enzyme glutamine synthetase might represent a useful test for functional glucocorticoid action .
Discussion After 10 years of research in GR and leukemia , it appears that the discrepancies seen among the results of the various studies may be in part accounted for by differences in the selection of the patients and the experimental procedures used to determine receptor levels .
Selection of the Patients and Target Tissue For experimental convenience , most of the studies have been performed using peripheral leukocytes , although it is now well recognized that blood cells do not entirely reflect the proliferative activity of the bone marrow ( 51 ) .
Indeed , comparative studies performed in the same patients may show differences in GR levels between blood and bone marrow samples ( 8 , 13 ) .
Bone marrow , which is usually the main focus of tumoral proliferation , may thus represent a more appropriate tissue for the study of glucocorticoid action , particularly in leukopenic patients .
When the patients have been selected on the basis of more than 80 to 90 % of circulating or bone marrow blast cells , attempts to correlate GR levels with some other parameters ( immunological type , response to combined chemotherapy ) have been more successful .
Problems of Receptor Determination Besides the technical problems of receptor determination , which have already been underlined ( storage of the cells , cytosol versus whole-cell assay ) , it should be kept in mind that receptor concentration in a given target cell is not constant .
It may vary under the influence of several factors , as reviewed elsewhere ( 18 , 45 ) , and in particular as a function of the extracellular concentration of glucocorticoids ( 2 , 22 , 28 , 34 , 63 , 73 ) .
It appears that the patients to be investigated should be examined at diagnosis before any corticoid therapy .
Indeed , the level of GR in the previously treated patients , even if they have been withdrawn from steroid treatment 1 to 2 weeks before , is lower than that of patients at diagnosis ( 5 , 31 ) .
Determination of Steroid Sensitivity Studies performed in mouse lymphoma cell lines have demonstrated a fairly good correlation between the level of GR and the in vitro action of steroids ( 40 , 62 ) .
Similar investigations carried out on cells taken from patients failed to show such a correlation , as mentioned above .
Furthermore , it was demonstrated that the increase in receptor levels following mitogen treatment was not associated with any significant alteration of in vitro steroid effect ( 70 ) .
On the other hand , despite the general assumption that steroid-induced cell death represents a consequence of the catabolic actions of the drug , there is no relationship between the extent of cell lysis and the metabolic inhibition ( 34 , 59 ) .
It should , however , be noted that the in vitro inhibitory action of glucocorticoids was more marked in lymphoid populations characterized by a high level of proliferative activity ( 32 , 33 , 35 ) .
Recent investigations have also shown that the in vitro action of steroids on lymphoid cells may be more complex than previ- FEBRUARY 1984 GR and Sensitivity in Human Lymphoid Tissues ously believed .
Gillis et a/ .
( 27 ) demonstrated that inhibition of mitogen-induced cell proliferation by steroids represents an indirect action ( suppressing the production of a T-cell growth factor by a small subset of cells ) rather than a direct action at the level of activated lymphocyte .
Moreover , the in vitro sensitivity of leukemic blasts may not always reflect the in vivo response to combined chemotherapy .
We have already seen that the response to treatment as well as the number of GR appears more probably dependent on the immunological type of the cells .
It was recently demonstrated that high levels of GR were usually associated with the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidy !
transferase activity in lymphoid as well as in myeloid leukemic cells ( 55 , 68 ) .
Although these results should be confirmed in more extensive studies , including careful choice of patients and investigation of immunological markers , they suggest a relationship between the level of receptors and cell differentiation .
Evaluation of the in vivo response to corticoid therapy is even more complex because it represents a combination of different mechanisms including , among others , inhibition of cell proliferation and cell lysis , but also cell recirculation and sequestration .
In addition , it is obvious that in vivo the perturbations caused by steroid treatment on the general hormonal balance , on vascular function , and on immunological reactions may influence considerably the evolution of leukemia ( 4 ) .
Nevertheless , there are now some indications suggesting that the cells of ALL sensitive to steroid therapy and/or chemotherapy tend to contain more receptor than do cells of nonresponders or patients who will relapse .
Finally , there are several aspects of steroid action which have not been fully explored but may play an important role in neoplastic lymphoid tissues .
Recent findings have shown the existence of a high level of transcortin in patients with lymphatic leukemia and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( 16 ) .
This abnormality was associated with HLA antigens of the B and C loci .
These results , together with the indications suggesting that GR and steroid response may be under the control genetic influence ( 3 , 9 , 29 ) , raise the question of the possible role of transcortin in the modulation of GR and steroid sensitivity .
in addition , several authors have described an increased metabolism of cortisol in malignant lymphoid cells ( 23 , 39 ) .
Others have shown a relatively higher metabolism of cortisol by B-lymphocytes than by T-lymphocytes and suggested that this may explain the greater resistance to cortisol of B-cells ( 41 ) .
It remains to be determined whether this phenomenon may play a role in the expression of GR and/or in the control of cell response .
