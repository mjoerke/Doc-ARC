Constitutive Overexpression of the L-Selectin Gene in Fresh Leukemic Cells of Adult T-Cell Leukemia That Can Be Transactivated by Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 Tax By Makoto Tatewaki , Kazunari Yamaguchi , Masao Matsuoka , Toshinori Ishii , Masayuki Miyasaka , Shigeo Mori , Kiyoshi Takatsuki , and Toshiki Watanabe L-selectin is an adhesion molecule of the selectin family that mediates the initial step of leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium .
Upon cellular activation , expression of the L-selectin gene is downregulated at both the protein and mRNA levels .
To understand the mechanism of leukemic cell infiltration into organs , we studied the expression and regulation of L-selectin mRNA in fresh leukemic cells of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) patients and investigated the response of the L-selectin promoter to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax , which is a viral transcriptional transactivator , Flow cytometry showed that L-selectin was expressed on fresh ATL cells along with other activation antigens .
Northern blot analysis showed that ATL cells overexpressed the L-selectin mRNA and that the level was aber-rantly upregulated after PMA stimulation .
Studies using in situ hybridization showed expression of the L-selectin mRNA in the infiltrating leukemic cells in the liver of two ATL patients .
Intravenous injection of a rat T-cell line that DULT T-CELL LEUKEMIA ( ATL ) is an aggressive , usually fatal T-cell malignancy that is caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infection . ''
ATL is also characterized by unique clinical features such as a very high frequency of hypercalcemia and a remarkable tendency of organ infiltration by leukemic cells into the liver , spleen , lungs , and skin . '' ''
HTLV-1 is also associated with chronic inflammatory disorders such as tropical spastic parapa-resis /HTLV-1 -associated myelopathy ( TSP/HAM ) , HTLV-I uveitis ( HU ) , alveolitis , and others . '' ''
Infiltration of mononuclear cells and HTLV-1-infected T cells is also a characteristic commonly found in these HTLV-1 -associated diseases .
Spinal cord lesions of patients with TSP/HAM are characterized by demyelination accompanied by mononuclear cell infiltration and perivascular cuffing . ''
In the aqueous humor of the patients with HU , the infiltrating cells consisted mostly of lymphocytes with a predominance of T cells and the HTLV-1-infected cells were almost universally present among them .
* '' Thus , the infiltration of lymphocytes in various organs could be one of the common pathologic findings among diseases associated with HTLV-1 infection .
L-selectin is a member of the selectin family of adhesion molecules . ''
It is expressed on the surface of most leuko-cytes , including lymphocytes , neutrophils , monocytes , eosin-ophils , hematopoietic progenitor cells , and immature thymo-cytes .
L-selectin is a highly glycosylated protein of 95 to 105 kD on neutrophils and of 74 kD on lymphocytes .
It is thought to mediate lymphocyte recirculation to the peripheral lymph node , specifically recognizing high endothelial ve-nules in lymph nodes .
In addition , L-selectin is involved in the adhesion of neutrophils , monocytes , and lymphocytes to activated endothelium at sites of inflammation .
Extravasation of circulating lymphocytes consists of three steps '' '' : rolling mediated by selectins , sticking by integrins , and transendo-thelial migration .
L-selectin is considered to mediate the initial attachment of lymphocytes to endothelium , which determines the stickiness of the cells .
After cellular activation , this molecule rapidly disappears Blood , Vol 86 , No 8 ( October 15 } , 1995 ; pp 3109-3117 overexpresses L-selectin showed increased organ infiltra-tion .
The induction of Tax expression in JPX9 cells resulted in about a twofold increase in the mRNA expression levels compared with the basal level .
Chloramphenicol acetylitrans-ferase ( CAT ) } assay after transient cotransfection showed about a fivefold transactivation of the L-selectin promoter by Tax .
The serum level of the shed form of L-selectin was significantly increased in ATL patients { mean + SD , 4,215.4 + 4,111 ng/mL } compared with those of asymptomatic carriers and healthy biood donors { mean + SD , 1,148.0 + 269.0 ng/ mL and 991.9 + 224 ng/mL , respectively ) .
These results indicated that ATL cells constitutively overexpress the L-selectin gene that can be transactivated by HTLV-1 Tax .
The overexpression of L-selectin , as well as of inflammatory cytokines , by ATL cells may provide a basis for ATL cells to attach the vascular endothelium , leading to transmigration and organ infitration .

from the cell surface by shedding '' and transcription of the mRNA is also downregulated by 18 to 24 hours . '' ''
This downregulation is thought to prepare the extravasated cells for transmigration into tissues .
The extracellular domain is proteolytically shed from the cell surface '' '' and the shed form of L-selectin ( sL-selectin ) is present at a relatively high concentration in the normal serum , in which it is functionally active , inhibiting leukocyte attachment to the endothelium at high concentrations . ''
Thus , the regulation of L-selectin expression at the transcriptional level as well as in protein processing appears to be an important determinant of physiologic and pathologic manifestations of the function of this adhesion molecule .
HTLV-1 has a transcriptional activator , Tax , that regulates viral replication at the transcriptional level . '' ''
Transactivation of the viral genes by Tax is mediated through three repeats of a 21-bp enhancer in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) . ''
Because Tax can not directly bind to the enhancer sequence , the cellular transcription factors are thought to mediate the From the Department of Pathology , The Institute of Medical Science , The University of Tokyo , Tokyo ; the Second Department of Internal Medicine , Kumamoto University School of Medicine , Kuma-moto ; and the Division of Organ Bioregulation , Biomedical Research Center , Osaka University Medical School , Osaka , Japan .

3110 transactivation . ''
In addition to the viral genes , Tax induces the expression of the cellular transcription factor genes '' that are controlled by transmembrane signals and also some genes that encode cytokines and their receptors . ''
Some of the genes that can be transactivated by Tax are constitutively expressed in ATL cells that modulate clinical features . '' ''
ATL cells have a membrane phenotype of activated CD4* T cells , expressing interleukin-2 receptor a ( IL-2Ra ) , HLA-DR , and other activated cell antigens . '' '' '' '
The data of Ishikawa et al .
suggested that ATL cells are characterized as CD4* Leu-8* T cells . ''
Because Leu-8 antigen is identical to L-selectin , ATL cells express typical activation antigens and L-selectin at the same time , which suggests that the regulation of L-selectin expression is aberrant .
We studied the expression of L-selectin in ATL cells and tested the regulation of its gene expression by HTLV-1 Tax , which would provide a clue to understanding the molecular mechanism of L-selectin gene expression and leukemic cell infiltration into various organs in ATL patients .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients plasma and cell samples .
ATL was diagnosed according to the described criteria . ''
Briefly , a T-lymphocyte neoplasm that resulted from the monoclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected T cells was diagnosed as ATL .

using an sL-selectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit ( Bender MedSystems , Vienna , Austria ) and those of the soluble form of IL-2Ra ( sIL-2Ra ) were quantified with an sIL-2Ra ELISA kit ( T cell Diagnostics , Cambridge , MA ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The plasma or serum samples numbered 29 from ATL patients , 10 from asymptomatic carriers , and 10 from seronega-tive control individuals .
Among the samples from ATL patients , PBMCs from 5 were included in the analysis of L-selectin mRNA expression using Nothern hybridization .
RESULTS The surface expression of L-selectin on ATL cells .
- Flow cytometry showed that the percentage of L-selectin-positive cells among those that were CD4* was 65.7 % + 17.6 % ( mean + SD ) in ATL patients , whereas that of the normal control was 36.5 % + 6.15 % ( mean + SD ; Table 1 ) .
The results of the flow cytometry are summarized in Fig 1 .
The population of Leu-8-positive cells among the CD4* cells that almost represents the entire leukemic cell population was significantly high in ATL patients ( P = .0002 by Mann-Whitney U test ) .

20 ting showed that normal PBMCs expressed L-selectin transcripts at a relatively high level and that the PBMCs of ATL patients , which consisted of mainly ATL cells , expressed it at much higher levels ( Fig 2 ) .
These results were confirmed in all 8 patients with ATL that were studied .
We then tested the modulation of gene expression of L-selectin by activating the cells in vitro .
The level of L-selectin expression in the ATL cells was upregulated after 18 to 24 hours of stimulation with PMA , whereas the normal PBMCs were downregulated ( Fig 3 ) .
All of the three HTLV-1 viral transcripts , ie , geno-mic , env , and pX , were detected after stimulation , whereas they were not expressed in fresh leukemic cells at a detectable level ( Fig 3 ) .

L-selectin mRNA expression was upregulated after PMA stimulation in ATL cells .
HTLV-1 viral mRNA was also induced by PMA stimulation of ATL cells .
tively overexpressed L-selectin mRNA in the absence of viral gene expression , which was further upregulated after PMA stimulation .
The correlation between viral gene expression including pX mRNA and upregulation of L-selectin gene expression suggested that the viral transactivator , Tax that is encoded by pX mRNA , is involved in the induction of L-selectin gene expression , as it is with other cellular genes .
The expression of L-selectin mRNA in the infiltrating leukemic cells was studied using in situ hybridization of the liver samples of two ATL patients that show perivascular infiltration of ATL cells .
A liver biopsy specimen of a chronic hepatitis patient served as a control .
Serial sections of the liver were hybridized with DIG-labeled antisense ( Fig 4A ) or sense ( Fig 4B ) L-selectin cRNA probe .
Hybridization signals for L-selectin mRNA were detected in infiltrating mononuclear cells in Glisson 's sheath of the liver ( Fig 4A ) only when the antisense cRNA probe was used .
Immunohistochemical staining with UCHL-1 monoclonal antibody showed that most of the infiltrating cells were T cells ( Fig 4C ) .
Almost no hybridization for L-selectin mRNA was detected in the infiltrating lymphocytes in the biopsy specimen of a chronic active hepatitis patient ( data not shown ) .
Organ infiltration of a rat T-cell line that overexpresses L-selectin .
As shown in Fig 5 , many FITC-labeled cells were detected immunohistochemically in Glisson 's sheath of the liver when TARL-2 ( L+ ) cells were injected , whereas only a few were detected when the original cells were used .
Effcient FITC labeling of both cells was confirmed by detection of the injected cells in the lung in which these two cells did not show a marked difference in the number of trapped cells ( data not shown ) .
TATEWAKI ET AL The induction of L-selectin gene expression by Tax in JPX-9 cells .
To examine the effect of Tax on the L-selectin gene expression , we used JPX-9 cells that have an inducible Tax gene .
We studied the time course of the expression of L-selectin and Tax by means of Northern blotting .
CdCl ; added to the culture medium induced Tax gene expression in JPX-9 cells within 1.5 hours . '' ''
Although L-selectin gene is constitutively expressed in JPX-9 cells at a relatively high level , the expression started to increase along with the induction of Tax expression .
It showed a small peak at 2 hours , a small decrease at 6 hours , and then a continuous increase until 33 hours , reaching about double the basal level ( Fig 6 ) .
CdCl ; did not influence the level of L-selectin gene expression in the parental Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the results suggested that Tax increased the transcription of the L-selectin gene and that endogenous cellular factors are involved in the induction .
The L-selectin promoter is transactivated by HTLV-1 Tax .
To examine whether the L-selectin promoter , which we identified ( Tatewaki et al , submitted for publication ) , responds to Tax , we assayed CAT by means of transient cotransfection with the Tax expression vector .
The reporter plasmid , pLS-1 CAT , has the L-selectin promoter fragment up to -885 .
The promoter was activated by Tax both in Jurkat and FL cell lines .
Representative results are shown in Fig 7 .
The magnitude of transactivation by Tax was about fivefold in FL cells and a little less in Jurkat cells .
To identify the Tax-responsive element ( s ) , we prepared CAT reporter plasmids with a serially deleted promoter sequence and tested the response to Tax .
However , the levels of transactivation were gradually decreased with deletion and no specific region that affected the response was identified ( data not shown ) .
These results suggested that multiple elements in the promoter are involved in the transactivation by Tax .
Elevated serum levels of sL-selectin in ATL patients .
To examine the overexpression of L-selectin by ATL cells in vivo , we measured the level of sL-selectin in the sera of 29 ATL patients , 10 asymptomatic carriers , and 10 normal blood donors .
We also measured the serum level of IL-2Ra , which is a good marker of leukemic cell mass in vivo . ''
The mean level of sL-selectin in 29 patients with ATL was significantly increased ( mean + SD , 4,215.4 + 4,111 ng/ mL ) compared with those in asymptomatic carriers and normal blood donors ( mean + SD , 1,148.0 + 269 ng/mL and 991.9 + 224 ng/mL , respectively ; Fig 8 ) .
We studied the correlation between sL-selectin and sIL-2Ra in samples from 25 patients with ATL .
As shown in Fig 9 , the level of sL-selectin correlated well with that of sIL-2Ra ( y = 0.6 ) , suggesting that the serum level of sL-selectin depends on the leukemic cell mass .
These results provided more evidence that L-selectin is overexpressed by ATL cells in vivo .
DISCUSSION The adhesion properties of peripheral blood leukemic cells from 10 patients with ATL have been characterized by Ishikawa et al . ''
They showed that E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) mediate ATL cell adhesion to endothelial cells .
However , the counter-receptors on ATL cells for E-selectin and VCAM-1 remained to be determined .

OVEREXPRESSION OF L-SELECTIN IN ATL Adhesion molcules expressed on ATL cells have not been well characterized .
Fukudome et al '' '' reported that intercellu-lar adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) expression was highly induced in human T cells transformed by HTLV-1 and fresh ATL cells .
However , it is not known whether they are involved in organ infiltration of ATL cells .
Thus , further characterization of adhesion molecules expressed on ATL cells should help understand the mechanism underlying organ in-filtration .

Measured radioactivity was corrected using that of GAPDH .
cells cleary showed that they expressed Leu-8 antigen ( Table 1 and Fig 1 ) .
The mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) of positive cells was generally low in ATL cells compared with that of normal controls .
Considering the constitutive overexpression of mRNA shown in this study , low MFI may suggest a rapid turnover of the protein .
In line with this notion , other investigators have reported variable levels of L-selectin expression on ATL cells . ''
It has been reported that L-selectin surface expression is downregulated by various leukocyte isolation procedures , '' '' which may explain some inconsistency in the data reported by different groups .
Therefore , to characterize the L-selectin expression , mRNA expression should be studied by such means as Northern blotting in addition to flow cytometry and immunocytochem-istry .
The results of our Northern blot analysis showed a rather constant and high level of mRNA expression in ATL samples ( Fig 2 ) , which is consistent with the results of our flow cytometric analysis .
In addition , demonstration of L-selectin mRNA in the infiltrating cells in the liver of ATL A B % Conversion Tax patients ( Fig 4 ) , but not in the liver with inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes , appears to provide more evidence for abnormal regulation of gene expression , because it was reported that L-selectin expression was downregulated after extravasation . ''
Subsets of CD4* T cells that showed enhanced transendo-thelial migration were identified as CD29 '' '' ® '' , and CD45RA~ .
`` ° These phenotypes are similar to those of ATL cells . '' '
In addition to this , the overexpression of L-selectin may render ATL cells more sticky to vascular endothelial cells than normal T cells .
Furthermore , ATL and HTLV-1-infected cells produce various inflammatory cyto-kines . ''
These phenotypic characteristics of ATL cells would enable them to activate vascular endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and to attach themselves firmly to activated endothelium .
The notion that overexpression of L-selectin itself can affect the lymphocyte recirculation seems to be partly supported by our observation that a rat T-cell line that overexpresses L-selectin showed an increased Fig 7 .

level of organ infiltration when injected into a rat intravenously ( Fig 5 ) .
However , Schleiffenbaum et al '' '' have shown that the increased levels of sL-selectin in the medium inhibited the interaction between L-selectin and its ligands .
Therefore , it appears more likely that , even though ATL cells might have enhanced capacity to adhere to and transmigrate the endothelial cells , organ infiltration is determined by the dynamic balance in vivo between the increased stickiness of ATL cells and the inhibitory effect of sL-selectin in the serum .
Thus , to understand the biologic significance of the L-selectin overexpression , the correlation between the serum levels of sL-selectin and the clinical manifestation of organ infiltration in ATL patients of each clinical subtype should be further studied , and the gene expression of other adhesion molecules as well as inflammatory cytokines should be characterized .
As mentioned before , HTLV-1 Tax induces expression of cytokines , growth factors , and their receptors . ''
IL-2Ra and parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) are examples of these genes , and they are constitutively overexpressed in ATL cells . ''
The overexpression of cellular genes that can be transactivated by Tax is one of the common features of ATL cells .
The L-selectin gene appears to be the first example of adhesion molecules with this characteristic .
The level of transactivation of the L-selectin promoter induced by Tax was about fivefold in repeated experiments , which is lower than that of reported cellular genes .
This difference could be explained by the relatively high level of 3115 background activity of L-selectin promoter both in Jurkat cells and FL cells ( Fig 6 ) .
Similar observations were recently reported by Ohbo et al '' '' on the IL-2Ry chain gene expression that was transactivated by HTLV-1 Tax .
It may also be due to the difference in the molecular mechanism underlying the transactivation .
It has been shown that HTLV-1 Tax transactivates gene expression through interactions with cellular transcription factors such as CREBP , NF- « B , and SRF . ''
No consensus sequence elements for these factors were found in the L-selectin promoter up to -885 bp .
In-stead , there are multiple sequence elements for Ets family oncogenes ( Tatewaki et al , submitted for publication ) , which reportedly participate in the transactivation of HTLV-1 LTR and the promoter of the PTHrP gene .
`` `` '' ° Functional characterization is now under way to answer whether these characteristics of the L-selectin promoter could explain the apparent difference in the response to Tax .
In all the ATL samples that we have so far examined , viral mRNAs were not detected using Northern blotting .
Furthermore , our RT-PCR studies of fresh primary ATL cells from 25 patients could not detect pX mRNA in more than half of them .
The amplification of the pX mRNA was very weak in the remaining samples and it corresponded to a level of 1 viral mRNA expressing cell among 1 x 10+ negative cells ( Watanabe et al , unpublished observations ) .
Thus , we could not exclude the possibility that the amplified pX mRNA was expressed in nontransformed HTLV-1-infected cells that contaminated the samples .
It was also shown that nearly half of the ATL patients have defective provirus that lacks 5 '' regions in their tumor cells '' '' ( Matsuoka et al , unpublished observation ) .
These results indicated that the L-selectin gene is constitutively overexpressed in the absence of HTLV-1 Tax in vivo .
This finding implies that there is another mechanism independent of HTLV-1 Tax underlying the overexpression of L-selectin in fresh ATL cells .

3116 same notion could be applied to other Tax-responsive genes such as IL-2Ra , PTHrP , and transforming growth factor # that are overexpressed in fresh ATL cells .
In conclusion , we showed the constitutive overexpression of the L-selectin gene in ATL cells in vivo that can be transactivated by HTLV-1 Tax that provided another clue to understanding the pathogenesis of organ infiltration of ATL cells .
