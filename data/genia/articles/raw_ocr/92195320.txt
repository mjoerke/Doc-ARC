4 A Lymphoid Cell-Specific Nuclear Factor Containing c-Rel-Like Proteins Preferentially Interacts with Interleukin-6 Motifs Whose Activities Are Repressed in Lymphoid Cells KOHZO NAKAYAMA , HIROKO SHIMIZU , KATSUYUKI MITOMO , TOMOO WATANABE , SHU-ICHI OKAMOTO , anp KEN-ICHI YAMAMOTO®* Department of Molecular Pathology , Cancer Research Institute , Kanazawa University , 13-1 Takaramachi , Kanazawa , Ishikawa 920 , Japan Received 25 October 1991/Accepted 23 December 1991 The proto-oncoprotein c-Rel is a member of the nuclear factor « B transcription factor family , which includes the p50 and p65 subunits of nuclear factor « B .
We show here that c-Rel binds to « B sites as homodimers as well as heterodimers with p50 .
These homodimers and heterodimers show distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various « B motifs .
In particular , the c-Rel homodimer has a high affinity for interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and beta interferon « B sites .
In spite of its association with p50 in vitro , however , we found a lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor in vivo that contains c-Rel but not p50 epitopes ; this factor , termed IL-6xB binding factor II , appears to contain the c-Rel homodimer and preferentially recognizes several IL-G « B-related B motifs .
Although it has been previously shown that the IL-6icB motif functions as a potent IL-1/tumor necrosis factor-responsive element in nonlymphoid cells , its activity was found to be repressed in lymphoid cells such as a Jurkat T-cell line .
We also present evidence that IL-6B binding factor II functions as a repressor specific for IL-6xcB-related iB motifs in lymphoid cells .
Nuclear factor « B ( NF- « B ) was originally identified as a B-cell-specific nuclear factor binding to an enhancer element called xB of the k immunoglobulin light-chain gene ( 58 ) .
It is now clear , however , that NF-KB is present in many different types of cells and plays an important role in the inducible expression of diverse cellular genes through binding to various kB sequences .
These genes mostly include those involved in host defense , such as genes for various cyto-kines , interleukin-2 receptor a chains , cell adhesion mole-cules , major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I and II antigens , and acute-phase proteins ; NF-KB , in addition , binds to « B sites in several viral enhancers such as those of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , cytomegalovirus , and simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) and is thought to be involved in viral activation ( 2 , 38 ) .
Although NF- « B is constitutively present in the nucleus of B cells , NF- « B is an inducible nuclear factor in other types of cells ( 59 ) .
Subsequent studies have shown that NF- « B preexists in the cytoplasm in the inactive form complexed with an inhibitory protein termed IxB ; it has been suggested that stimulation of cells by a variety of agents such as phorbol ester , bacterial lipopoly-saccharide , virus , double-stranded RNA , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- « ) , and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax transactivator results in the dissociation of the IxB/NF- « B complex and subsequent translocation of NF-KB to the nucleus ( 3 , 4 ) .
Although the activation of protein kinase A or C and subsequent phosphorylation of IxB has been proposed to be a major activation pathway for NF- « B ( 19 , 61 ) , other studies suggest the involvement of other signal transduction pathways as well ( 27 , 48 ) .
NF- « B contains two proteins of 50 and 65 kDa termed p50 and p65 , respectively ( 5 ) .
Although earlier studies showed that only p50 subunits have DNA-binding properties and * Corresponding author .
1736 therefore suggested that the DNA-binding activity of NF- « B is mediated through its p50 portion ( 5 , 32 ) , more recent studies have shown that p65 can also bind DNA apparently as homodimers ( 53 , 56 , 64 ) .
Thus , these proteins bind to kB sequences primarily as heterodimers ( p50/p65 ) but also bind as homodimers .
In particular , the p50 homodimer shows a high affinity for symmetrical « B motifs such as xB sequences of MHC class I gene promoters ( 6 , 34 ) .
By contrast , asymmetric prototype « kB motifs found in the enhancers of the k immunoglobulin gene and in the SV40 and HIV viral enhancers are weak binding sites for the p50 homodimer but have a high affinity for the p50/p65 heterodimer ( NF- « B ) ( 6 , 63 ) .
Since p50 has been shown to be identical to a previously characterized constitutive nuclear factor that specifically binds to the MHC xB sequence ( 34 ) , the p50 homodimer appears to be physiologically present in vivo ( 6 , 34 ) .
However , it is not known whether p50 or p65 homodimers have any physiological roles in vivo .
Recent cloning and sequencing of cDNA clones encoding p65 and a 110-kDa precursor of p50 have revealed an extensive sequence homology between these proteins in their N-terminal portions .
Surprisingly , the predicted sequences of these proteins are also highly homologous to those of the c-rel proto-oncogene and of the Drosophila maternal morphogen dorsal gene ; in particular , p65 is related to c-Rel more closely than to p50 ( 9 , 20 , 21 , 47 , 53 , 56 ) .
c-rel is the cellular cognate of v-rel , the transforming gene of highly oncogenic reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T that induces an acute fatal lymphoma in young birds .
Interestingly , the products of the c-re/ and dorsal genes , in addition to their sequence similarity to p50 and p65 , show unique subcellular partitioning , as NF- « B does ( 21 ) .
Furthermore , it has been shown more recently that the c-Rel and v-Rel proteins can recognize some « B sequences ( 8 , 28 , 34 ) .
Thus , these proteins constitute a distinct family of transcription factors recognizing xB elements and showing unique subcellular partitioning .
However , it remains to be established that Vor .
12 , 1992 various complexes of the members of this family have different DNA-binding specificities or affinities and transcriptional potentials or are present physiologically in vivo .
In this report , we show that c-Rel homodimers and p50/c-Rel heterodimers show distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various kB motifs .
Particularly , the c-Rel homodimer has a strong affinity for a « B motif found in the IL-6 gene promoter , and the p50/c-Rel heterodimer can not bind to the IL-6 « B motif in the presence of the c-Rel homodimer .
We also show the presence of a lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor that is distinct from c-Rel homodimers or p50/c-Rel heterodimers but contains c-Rel epitopes and has an IL-6 « B-specific DNA-binding property .
Evidence is also presented that this factor might function as a transcriptional repressor specific for the IL-6 « B-related motifs in lymphoid cells .
IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of the immune response , he-matopoiesis , and inflammation ( 35 ) .
We and others have previously shown that the IL-6 « kB motif is an important promoter element in the regulation of IL-6 gene expression ( 42 , 60 , 68 ) .
Thus , the results presented in this paper suggest that c-Rel-related factors play a role in the host defense through the regulation of the IL-6 gene and possibly also of some other cytokine genes having IL-6 « B-related promoter elements .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of cDNAs encoding human p50 and c-Rel by using the polymerase chain reaction .
The following polymerase chain reaction primers were synthesized on the basis of the sequences of human p50 and c-re/ cDNAs ( 11 , 34 ) : p50 5 ' primer , - 5'-AATCTAGACTCGCCACCCGGCTTCAGA-3 ' ( nucleotides 152 to 173 in the 5° noncoding region ; this primer contains an Xbal site [ underlined ] ) ; p50 3 ' primer , ( nucleotides 1665 to 1686 ) ; c-Rel 5 primer , 5-TACATATGGCCTCCGGTGCGT ATAAC-3 ' ( nucleotides 178 to 199 ; this primer contains an NdeI site [ underlined ] in the methionine start codon ) ; and c-Rel 3 ' primer , AATT-3 ' ( nucleotides 2021 to 2043 ) .
Two micrograms of poly ( A ) * RNA isolated from HeLa cells was reverse transcribed ; 1/10 of the reverse transcripts was run for each reaction as described previously ( 37 ) , using 35 cycles of 1 min at 90°C , 2 min at 55°C , and 3 min at 70°C .
Then 1.5-kb p50 cDNA ( nucleotides 152 to 1686 , amino acids 1 to 502 ) and 1.8-kb c-ref cDNA ( nucleotides 178 to 2043 , amino acids 1 to 587 ) were amplified , gel purified on a 0.7 % agarose gel , and cloned into the Smal or Hincll site of the Bluescript pKSII* vector .
In contrast to the previously reported clone isolated from a Daudi cDNA library ( 11 ) , our c-rel cDNA clone did not contain an in-frame 96-bp Alu fragment .
Synthesis of human p50 and c-Rel proteins in bacteria and antibody preparation .
p50 cDNA cloned into pKSII * was cut out by BamHI and recloned into the BamHI site of the pET-3b expression vector ( 55 ) ; this p50 expression vector encodes the 63-kDa p50 protein ( amino acids 18 to 504 of the p50 precursor ) , which is larger than the physiological p50 subunit of NF- « B ( 5 ) .
c-re/ cDNA was cut out by Nde !
and cloned into the Nde !
site of the pET-3a expression vector ; this plasmid codes for the near-full-length 79-kDa c-Rel protein ( amino acids 1 to 582 ) ( 11 ) .
These expression vectors were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 .
The transformed bacteria were grown and then induced with 1 mM isopropylthiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 2 to 3 h. Most of INTERACTIONS OF c-Rel-RELATED FACTORS WITH IL-6 « B 1737 the p50 protein remained soluble after extraction of harvested bacteria and was purified by DEAE and phosphocellulose column chromatography .
The c-Rel protein which was largely in the inclusion body fraction after centrifugation was purified by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography in the presence of 8 M urea and subsequently renatured as described previously ( 25 ) .
Rabbit antisera were prepared by six subcutaneous injections of 100 ug of proteins with complete Freund 's adjuvant at weekly intervals .
The specificities of these antisera were established by Ouchterlony and Western immunoblot analysis .
In vitro transcription , translation , and immunoprecipita-tion .
Two micrograms of pBluescript ( pKSII* ) containing either p50 cDNA ( amino acids 1 to 504 ) or c-re/ cDNA ( amino acids 1 to 587 ) was linearized with EcoRI which recognized EcoRI sites in the polylinker of pKSII* .
RNAs were synthesized in a 20-pl reaction mixture , using T7 RNA polymerase as recommended by the manufacturer ( Promega ) .
Two-microliter samples of RNAs were used for in vitro translation , using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a 30-ul reaction mixture containing 25 wCi of *°S-labeled methionine as recommended by manufacturer ( Promega ) .
Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously ( 51 ) in a 100-pl volume containing 1.2 pl of antisera , 40 pl of Immsorbin ( Wako Co. Ltd. ) , and 3 pl of *°S-labeled p50 translated products , 1 wl of c-re/ products , or 3 ul of cotranslated products of p50 and c-re/ .
The immune complexes were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10 % poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) .
Analysis of protein-DNA interaction by EMSA .
The probes used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) were prepared from plasmids containing various « B sequences cloned in the multiple cloning site of pBLCAT3 by cutting at the 5'-end XbaI and 3'-end Hinfl sites and were 3 ' end labeled as described previously ( 60 ) .
Nuclear and cyto-solic extracts were prepared from unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with IL-la « or TNF- « for 30 min by the methods of Dignam et al .
( 17 ) and Baeuerle and Baltimore ( 3 ) , respectively .
IL-6 « B binding factor II ( BFII ) was partially fractioned from Jurkat nuclear extracts by gel filtration on Sephacryl $ -400 .
NF- « B was partially purified from nuclear extracts of TNF-stimulated HeLa cells by DEAE-cellulose , phosphocellulose ( P11 ) , and DNA-cellulose column chromatography .
EMSA was performed essentially as described previously ( 60 ) except that polyvinyl alcohol was omitted .
For heterodimerization , recombinant p50 proteins were incubated with recombinant c-Rel proteins at room temperature for 10 min in 20 pl of binding buffer before addition of DNA probes .
In the experiments using antibodies , 1 ul of antisera was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with nuclear extracts , purified fractions , or recombinant proteins in the binding buffer prior to addition of DNA probes .
DNA transfection and analysis of gene expression .
The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter genes containing various kB motifs were constructed by inserting synthetic « B motifs at the 5 ' end of the IL-6 TATA element as described before ( 60 ) .
For the expression of Tax proteins , pHTLV-1 Tax , which contains the Tax coding region of HTLV-1 under the control of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat , was used ( 52 ) .
Mouse L-TK~ , HeLa , and Hep3B cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
The human T-cell line Jurkat was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum .
Cells were transfected with 2 pug of CAT reporter genes and 1 ug of HTLV-1 Tax expression vectors per plate by the DEAE-dextran method as described 1738 NAKAYAMA ET AL .

RESULTS c-Rel homodimers and p50/c-Rel heterodimers show distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various B motifs .
The human p50 protein containing the N-terminal DNA-binding portion ( amino acids 18 to 504 ) and near-full-length c-Rel protein ( amino acids 1 to 582 ) were synthesized in bacteria by using the pET3 expression system .
The purified recombinant p50 and c-Rel proteins had apparent sizes of 63 and 79 kDa , respectively , on SDS-PAGE .
The recombinant p50 is larger than the physiological p50 subunit ( 5 ) , since the p50 precursor is presumably processed at sites more N terminal to amino acid 504 of p50 .
To examine whether c-Rel recognizes « B motifs as a homodimer as well as a heterodimer with p50 , we used the prototype « B sequence ( SV40xkB , GGGGACTTTCCAC ) found in the k immuno-globulin , HIV , and SV40 enhancers as a probe for EMSA .
As shown in Fig .
1A ( lane 6 ) , the c-Rel protein formed a DNA/protein complex , the mobility of which was considerably slower than that of the p50/DNA complex ( lane 1 ) , being consistent with the larger size of the c-Rel protein .
Surprisingly , without combined renaturation , mixing at room temperature for 10 min of p50 and c-Rel proteins with « B probes resulted in the formation of the DNA/protein complex , the mobility of which was intermediate between those of p50 and c-re/ DNA/protein complexes ( lane 2 to 5 ) and was comparable with that of HeLa-derived NF- « B ( Fig .
1B , lane 10 ) .
These results indicate that c-Rel proteins can bind DNA as a homodimer but also as a heterodimer with p50 .
In addition , the results of competition experiments fully confirmed DNA-binding specificities of the c-Rel-mediated nucleoprotein complex formation ( data not shown ) .
Figure 1A also shows that the relative amounts of the p50/c-Rel heterodimers formed were dependent on the relative amounts of p50 and c-Rel proteins present in the incubation mixture : 10 times more c-Rel proteins were required for equivalence in p50/c-Rel heterodimer formation ( 600 to 1,000 ng of c-Rel versus 60 ng of p50 ) ( Fig .
1A , lanes 2 to 5 ) .
This result can be explained by the fact that bacterially synthesized c-Rel proteins are not completely renatured after resolubilization ; bacterial p50 proteins , by contrast , remain soluble , and the purification of p50 does not require a solubilization step .
Alternatively , the relative inefficiency of c-Rel proteins may be an intrinsic property .
We then tested whether c-Rel homodimers and c-Rel/p50 heterodimers show different DNA-binding specificities or affinities for different « kB sequences .
We used MHCKB ( GGGGATTCCCC ) and IL-6 « B ( GGGATTTTCCC ) motifs in addition to SV40 « B as probes and used fixed amounts of p50 ( 60 ng ) and c-Rel ( 600 ng ) .
Figure 1B shows representative EMSA results .
As previously shown ( 34 , 63 ) , the p50 homodimer had a higher affinity for symmetrical « B motifs such as the MHCxB motif than for the asymmetrical SV40xB motif ; the affinity of p50 for was intermediate between them ( lanes 1 to 3 ) .
The c-Rel homodimer also showed only weak binding to the asymmetrical SV40kB motif ( lane 4 ) .
However , the p50/c-Rel heterodimer showed comparable binding to both symmetrical ( MHCKB ) and asymmetrical ( SV40xB ) motifs ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Interestingly , while the p50/c-Rel heterodimer/DNA complexes were predominantly formed with MHC and SV40 kB probes ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , significant amounts of the c-Rel homodimer/DNA complex in addition to the p50/c-Rel heterodimer/DNA complex were formed with an IL-6 « B probe under the same conditions ( lane 9 ) .
These results were also confirmed by cross-competition experiments using recombinant p50 and c-Rel proteins and SV40 , MHC , and IL-6KB sites ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the c-Rel homodimer appears to recognize the IL-6 « B motif with a higher affinity than does the p50/c-Rel heterodimer .
In addition , the kB motif found in the beta interferon promoter ( IFB , GGGAAATTCC ) ( 39 ) was also found to have a higher affinity for c-Rel homodimers than for p50 homodimers or pS50/c-Rel heterodimers ( data not shown ) .
To pursue this issue further , the fixed amount of p50 ( 30 ng ) and increasing amounts of c-Rel ( 400 to 1,000 ng ) were incubated with various « B probes .
As shown in Fig .
1C , c-Rel homodimer/DNA complexes were not readily visible with the SV40xB probe even at the input of 1,000 ng Vor .

Association of c-Rel with p50 in the absence of DNA-binding sites .
The c-re/ and p50 cDNAs were translated alone or cotranslated together in reticulocyte lysates that contained [ **SJme-thionine .
The in vitro-translated p50 ( lanes 1 to 3 ) , p50 and c-Rel ( lanes 4 to 6 ) , and c-Rel ( lanes 7 to 9 ) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with preimmune sera ( P ; lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ) , anti-p50 antisera ( a50 ; lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) , or anti-c-Rel antisera ( aR ; lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) .
Immune complexes were analyzed on SDS-10 % poly-acrylamide gels .
of c-Rel ( lane 4 ) .
By contrast , even at the input of 400 ng of c-Rel , significant p50/c-Rel heterodimer/DNA complexes were not seen with the IL-6 « B probe ( lane 9 ) .
The MHCKB probe appeared to have comparable affinities for the p50/c-Rel heterodimer and c-Rel homodimer ( lanes 5 to 8 ) .
Thus , the results of these experiments indicate that the c-Rel homodimer preferentially binds to some kB motifs such as IL-6 « B and IFxB .
We also examined whether p50 and c-Rel proteins can associate in the absence of DNA-binding sites .
After in vitro transcription and translation , association was evaluated by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-p50 or anti-c-Rel antisera .
As shown in Fig .
2 , p50 proteins ( 63 kDa ) translated in vitro were specifically recognized by anti-p50 ( lane 2 ) but not by anti-c-Rel ( lane 3 ) antisera ; a minor component ( 45 kDa ) which was also recognized by anti-p50 antisera ( lane 2 ) is probably a prematurely terminated product .
Anti-c-Rel antisera also specifically reacted with in vitro-translated c-Rel proteins ( 79 kDa ) and a 43-kDa prematurely terminated product ( lane 9 ) .
Thus , antisera prepared against recombinant p50 and c-Rel proteins were specific and did not cross-react each other despite considerable homology in their N-terminal portions .
However , both antisera commu-noprecipitated p50 and c-Rel proteins from the reaction mixture containing p50 and c-Rel ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , indicating the formation of p50/c-Rel heterodimers in the absence of DNA .
Interestingly , anti-p50 antisera coimmunoprecipitated the 43-kDa c-Rel product in the presence of p50 and anti-c-Rel antisera coimmunoprecipitated the 45-kDa p50 product in the presence of c-Rel ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , suggesting that these smaller p50 or c-Rel proteins can heterodimerize .
The formation of heterodimers and homodimers in the absence of DNA was also confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments ( data not shown ) .
INTERACTIONS OF c-Rel-RELATED FACTORS WITH IL-6kB 1739 A lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor specifically recognizing IL-G6 « B-related motifs contains c-Rel epitopes .
Since expression of the c-re/ gene has been shown to be much higher in lymphoid cells than in nonlymphoid cells ( 10 , 12 ) and since the c-Rel homodimer shows a high affinity for the IL-6 « B site ( Fig .
1 ) , we examined whether c-Rel homodimers could be detected in nuclear extracts from lymphoid cells by using IL-6 « B probes .
We prepared nuclear extracts from various lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells and analyzed them by EMSA .
A representative EMSA pattern seen with nuclear extracts from Jurkat helper T cells is shown in Fig .
3A .
As shown previously ( 45 , 54 ) , stimulation of Jurkat cells with TNF-a resulted in the induction of « B-binding factors ( termed NF- « B ) which had the mobility comparable to that of HeLa-derived NF- « B ; the results of epitope analysis indicated that Jurkat NF-kB is mostly a p50/p65 heterodimer ( see Fig .
5B ) ; Jurkat NF-KB recognized IL-6 and SV40 kB motifs with comparable affinities ( Fig .
3A , lanes 1 to 4 ) .
The IL-6kB probe , in addition , formed the DNA/protein complex , the mobility of which was considerably slower than those of nucleoprotein complexes mediated by NF- « B ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or by the c-Rel homodimer ( data not shown ) .
This factor is present constitutively and tentatively termed IL-6 « B BFII .
Since IL-6 « B BFII has a higher affinity for multimerized IL-6 « B sites than for a single site ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , we used multimerized ( three copies ) IL-6 « kB probes in the subsequent experiments .
Figure 3B shows the results of competition analysis .
The DNA/protein complex formed by IL-6 « B BFII and IL-6kB was specifically abolished by IL-6 « B ( lane 4 ) and IFB ( lane 5 ) but not significantly by SV40xB ( lane 2 ) and MHCxB ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Table 1 , IL-6 and IFB sequences both have 5-bp AT-rich sequences in the middle of their kB motifs , but has a cytosine residue in these AT-rich sequences .
We therefore constructed several mutants of the SV40kB motif ( Table 1 ) and tested them in competition experiments .
Interestingly , the SV40kB mutants having mutated central AT-rich sequences ( mt2 and mt7 ) competed for IL-6kB BFII-mediated complex formation ( Fig .
3B , lane 6 , and unpublished data ) , indicating that central AT-rich sequences are important for the interaction of IL-6 « B BFII with DNA .
We also analyzed the IL-6kB BFII activity in various types of cells .
The results ( Fig .
3C and 4 ) showed that the presence of IL-6 « B BFII is specific for lymphoid cells .
However , some deviations from this conclusion were noted : nuclear extracts from several human ( KM-1 , KM-2 , and AMO-1 ) and mouse ( MPC-11 ) myeloma cell lines as well as from phagocytic cell lines ( HL-60 and U937 ) showed reduced IL-6 « B BFII activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
The results that IL-6 « B BFII recognizes specifically IL-6B and is present only in lymphoid cells ( Fig .
3 and 4 ) suggest that IL-6 « kB BFII is related to c-Rel .
To further clarify this point , we tested the reactivity of IL-6 « B BFII with anti-c-Rel antisera by EMSA .
As expected from the results of immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-p50 and anti-c-Rel antisera ( Fig .
2 ) , anti-p50 reacted only with p50 and supershifted the recombinant p50 homodimer/DNA complex ( some inhibition of p50 binding to DNA was also observed ) ( Fig .
5A , lanes 2 and 8 ) ; anti-c-Rel antisera specifically supershifted the recombinant c-Rel homodimer/ DNA complex ( lanes 3 and 9 ) , and both anti-c-Rel and anti-p50 antisera supershifted the recombinant p50/c-Rel heterodimer/DNA complexes ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
In addition , anti-p50 antisera strongly reacted with purified HeLa NF-kB ( Fig .
5B , lane 2 ) and NF- « xB from IL-1-stimulated Hep3B cells ( lane 5 ) or from TNF-stimulated Jurkat cells ( lane 8 ) .

As shown previously ( 60 ) , all of the IL-6CAT constructs containing IL-6 , SV40 ( Fig .
6B ) , or MHC ( not shown ) kB sequences showed comparable responses to TNF-a and Tax ( Fig .
6B ) or to IL-la ( not shown ) in L-TK~ and HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
Surprisingly , however , while the CAT reporter genes containing SV40 or MHC « B motifs responded effectively to TNF-a as well as to Tax in Jurkat cells , the CAT reporter gene containing IL-6 « B was virtually unresponsive to these stimuli in Jurkat cells : weak but significant induction by Tax of the IL-6 « kB CAT reporter gene was noted ( Fig .
6A ) .
To determine sequence specificities involved in the lymphoid cell-specific unresponsiveness , we constructed CAT reporter genes containing mutated SV40xB sequences ( Table 1 ) and tested these constructs for their in vivo responsiveness to TNF-a in L-TK~ and Jurkat cells .
The results ( Fig .
7 ; summarized in Table 1 ) showed that ( i ) the constructs containing mutated SV40xB sequences which are defective in NF- « B binding ( mtl , mt3 , and mt6 ) ( Fig .
3B , lane 7 ) were totally inactive both in L-TK~ and Jurkat cells ; ( ii ) mt4 and mt5 , the binding specificities of which are similar to those of the wild-type SV40xB ( Fig .
3B , lanes 2 and 3 ) , responded to TNF-a in both L-TK~ and Jurkat cells , though the sequence ( TGGGGACTTITTC CCA ) of mt4 closely resembles of that of IL-6 « B ( TGG GATTTTCCCA ) ; and ( iii ) the mutants having substituted middle AT -rich sequences ( mt2 and mt7 ) recognized IL-6 « B BFII ( Fig .
3B , lanes 6 ) and responded to stimuli in L-TK~ cells but not in Jurkat cells .
Thus , the in vivo unresponsiveness of several kB sequences to TNF-a and Tax in Jurkat cells appears to be correlated to their ability to bind IL-6 « B BFIIL .

DISCUSSION The results presented in this report show that the c-re/ gene product binds the prototype NF- « B-binding motif ( SV40kB ) as a homodimer as well as a heterodimer with p50 ( Fig .
1A ) .
Other investigators also have shown recently that c-Rel binds MHCKB motifs as homodimers ( 28 ) and associates with p50 in the absence of DNA ( 43 ) .
We further show that the c-Rel homodimer and p50/c-Rel heterodimer show different DNA-binding specificities and affinities for SV40 , MHC , IL-6 , and IF « B sites ( Fig .
1B ) .
In particular , the IL-6 « B and IFB motifs show a strong affinity for the c-Rel homodimer , and binding of the p50/c-Rel heterodimer to these sites is inhibited in the presence of the c-Rel homodimer ( Fig .
1C ) .
By contrast , the SV40xB motif is a weak binding site for p50 and c-Rel homodimers but binds effectively to the p50/c-Rel heterodimer .
Although the p50 homodimer shows a very strong affinity for MHCxB , the extensive binding of p50 homodimer to MHCkB was not observed in the presence of c-Rel ( Fig .
1 ) .
The previous studies also showed that the p50 homodimer and p50/p65 heterodimer ( NF- « B ) have distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various « kB motifs ( 63 ) .

Responsiveness of various SV40kB mutants to TNF-a in Jurkat and L-TK~ cells .
CAT reporter genes containing two copies of various SV40xB mutant sequences ( see Table 1 ) were transfected into Jurkat or L-TK~ cells .
The degrees of TNF-a activation ( fold induction ) are indicated by numbers at the right of the bars .
association of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel in various combinations theoretically should provide the complexes with diverse but distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various kB motifs and possibly with different transcriptional activation potentials .
It is not surprising , therefore , that the in vivo activities of various xB elements are differentially regulated in different types of cells , through variations in relative nuclear levels of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel in the cells .
One of the surprising findings in this study is that c-Rel can readily associate with p50 without combined corenaturation or cotranslation ( Fig .
1 and 2 ) .
The association of p50 with p65 , however , has been reported to require combined corenaturation or cotranslation ( 5 , 53 ) .
It is not clear whether the failure of p65 to associate with p50 in the absence of corenaturation or cotranslation is due to an intrinsic property of p6S or incomplete renaturation .
However , given the observation that c-Rel readily associates with p50 and the fact that c-Rel is more homologous to p65 than to p50 , we are tempted to speculate that p65 also readily associates with p50 or c-Rel without corenaturation or cotranslation .
If so , the interactions between p50 , p65 , and c-Rel would be in constant equilibrium in vivo and would be modulated by relative levels of these proteins , which may be regulated by cell-type-specific mechanisms as well as by extracellular signals such as cytokines .
It is not , however , clear at present whether all of possible homo- or het-erodimeric complexes of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel are physiologically present in vivo .
Our results ( Fig .
5B ) as well as those of others show that the NF- « B activities from HeLa , Jurkat , Hep3B , and U937 cells are largely the complex of p50 and p65 and do not incorporate a significant amount of c-Rel proteins ( 1 , 57 ) .
By contrast , Inoue et al .
( 28 ) showed that c-Rel is a part of NF-KB activities in pre-B cells .
In addition , we show in this study that the lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor IL-6kB BFII contains c-Rel but not p50 epitopes ( Fig .
5C ) ( see below ) .
Thus , there appears to be some preference in the interactions between p50 , p65 , and c-Rel in different types of cells .
Vor .
12 , 1992 As discussed above , the association of c-Rel with p50 is not readily detectable in T cells in vivo , through c-Rel proteins are generally more abundant in lymphoid cells ( 10 , 12 ) and can readily associate with p50 in vitro ( Fig .
1 ) .
This finding raises the possibility that c-Rel and p50 form discrete complexes in vivo .
By using IL-6 « kB probes which have a high affinity for the c-Rel homodimer , we found the presence of a lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor ( s ) ( IL-6 « B BFII ) that specifically recognizes IL-6 « B and some other related « B motifs ( Fig .
3 and 4 ) .
IL-6 « B BFII has not been detected previously , probably because of the lack of appropriate probes such as IL-6 « kB .
The following observations indicate that IL-6kB BFII is a c-Rel-related factor .
First , and most important , the DNA-binding activity of IL-6kB BFII was inhibited by anti-c-Rel antibodies ( Fig .
5C ) .
Incomplete inhibition by anti-c-Rel antibodies is presumably due to multiprotein complex formation as discussed below , but it is also possible that a fraction of IL-6 « B BFII contains c-Rel-like factors , the antigenicity of which is distinct from that of c-Rel .
In addition , lack of reactivity of IL-6 « B BFII with anti-p50 antisera indicates that IL-6kB BFII does not contain significant amounts of p50 or its 110-kDa precursor .
Second , IL-6 « kB BFII and c-Rel homodimers have similar DNA-binding specificities and bind preferentially to subsets of kB motifs such as IL-6 and IF « B motifs which have 5-bp AT-rich sequences in the middle of binding sites ( Fig .
1 , 3 , and 4 ; Table 1 ) .
Third , the distributions of IL-6 « B BFII and c-Rel in various types of cells are strikingly similar : their expression is primarily limited to lymphoid cells ( Fig .
4 ) ( 10 , 12 ) .
Interestingly , however , both IL-6kB BFII and c-Rel are present only at low levels in myeloma and phagocytic cell lines ; MPC-11 cells , in particular , show only a trace of the IL-6 « B BFII activity and c-re/ mRNA ( Fig .
4 ) ( 12 , 24 , 36 ) .
Taken together , these observations indicate that c-Rel homodimers are the integral part of IL-6 « B BFII .
However , it is unlikely that IL-6 « B BFII is the c-Rel homodimer itself , since the mobility of the nucleoprotein complex mediated by IL-6 « B BFII on EMSA is considerably slower than that of the c-Rel/DNA complex .
In fact , the size of IL-6 « B BFII estimated by gel filtration ( > 660 kDa ) ( unpublished data ) is much larger than the estimated size of the c-Rel homodimer ( < 200 kDa ) .
These results are also in agreement with the results of previous studies showing that the c-Rel protein associates with other cellular proteins in avian lymphoid cells ( 16 , 36 , 49 ) .
Interestingly , two different c-Rel complexes have been identified ; the larger complex ( 400 to 800 kDa ) lacked the p34-40 protein ( 16 , 36 ) , which is thought to be a chicken IxB homolog .
IxB inhibits the DNA-binding activity of NF- « B and is thought to block its translocation to the nucleus , presumably through the p65 subunit ( 5 ) .
IxB likely interacts also with c-Rel and blocks its activity , since c-Rel is more homologous to p65 than to p50 .
Thus , we postulate that while a major part of c-Rel synthesized remains in the cytoplasm in a form complexed with IB , a portion moves to the nucleus and associates with other cellular proteins to form IL-6 « kB BFII .
The results that we could not detect IL-6 « B BFII activity in the cytosol fraction and that IL-6kB BFII activity is sensitive to deoxycholate { unpublished data ) further support this model .
However , the precise subunit composition of IL-6 « B BFII is not clear at present .
Although it has been suggested that one of two large proteins ( 115 and 124 kDa ) associated with c-Rel corresponds to the precursor of p50 ( 21 ) , our results ( Fig .
5C ) do not support this possibility .
In addition , Ballard et al .
( 8 ) have recently reported a novel Rel-related inducible nuclear factor .
However , this factor appears to be distinct from INTERACTIONS OF c-Rel-RELATED FACTORS WITH IL-6 « B 1743 A NF- B Q ( BF 11 ) p65 I1 -6 xB c rel complex cellular factor ( s ) +4 c-rel complex ( BF 41 ) SV-40 « B B ur-xs \ NF- « B a +1 1-6 « B NF- xB ® _.. sy 40 « B FIG .

Model for mechanisms of differential regulation by IL-6B BFII ( c-Rel complexes ) in IL-6 « B- and transcriptional activation in lymphoid ( A ) and nonlymphoid ( B ) cells .
It is postulated that while a p50/p65 heterodimer is a major positive transcriptional factor , IL-6 « B BFII is a constitutive IL-6 « B specific repressor .
IL-6 « B BFII is depicted as a complex in which c-Rel homodimers function as a DNA-binding subunit of this complex .
Because of the higher affinity of IL-6xB BFII for IL-6 « B sites , NF-kB can not displace IL-6kB BFII from IL-6xB sites and can not activate transcription .
IL-6 « B BFII , since IL-6kB BFII is a constitutive factor .
Further work is required to establish the molecular structure of IL-6 « B BFII .
We have previously shown that IL-6 « B functions as a potent IL-1/TNF-responsive element in nonlymphoid cells ( 60 ) .
However , as shown in the present study , IL-6kB was virtually inactive in the TNF response in Jurkat T cells , though weak and significant transactivation of IL-6 « B CAT reporter genes by HTLV-1 Tax was observed ( Fig .
6 ) .
This unresponsiveness of IL-6kB in Jurkat cells can not be ascribed to a lack of reactivity of IL-6 « B with Jurkat NF-kB , since IL-6 and SV40 kB sites have comparable affinities for Jurkat NF- « B ( Fig .
3A and unpublished data ) .
Mutational analysis of the SV40kB motif revealed that the SV40kB mutants ( mt2 and mt7 ) containing 5-bp AT-rich sequences bind IL-6 « B BFII and behave like IL-6xB in TNF response in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
7 and Table 1 ) .
Thus , the ability of various « kB sequences to bind IL-6 « kB BFII appears to be correlated to their unresponsiveness to TNF in Jurkat cells , as summarized in Table 1 .
Although the MHCxB motif shows a weak affinity for IL-6 « B BFII ( Table 1 ) but functions as a TNF- and Tax-responsive element in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
6 ) , this result is explained by the fact that MHCKB sites have a much higher affinity for NF- « B .
In IL-6 « B-related sites such as IL-6 « kB , IFkB , SV40 mt2 , and SV40 mt7 , however , NF- « B could not displace IL-6 « B BFII from these sites because of the higher affinity of IL-6kB BFII for these sites ; IL-6kB BFII thereby could suppress the NF- « B-mediated transcription ( Fig .
8 ) .
Although our model ( Fig .
8 ) 1744 NAKAYAMA ET AL .
postulates that the c-Rel-related IL-6 « B BFII functions as a repressor for IL-6kB-related motifs , others have shown that turkey or mouse c-Rel has transcriptional activation domains ( 13 , 30 ) and that cotransfection of mouse c-re/ expression vectors with reporter genes containing six copies of MHC « B sites results in significant transactivation of reporter genes in nonlymphoid F9 or NIH 3T3 cells ( 28 ) .
Perhaps the transcriptional activity of c-Rel would be differentially regulated in different types of cells through interaction with other cellular factors as discussed above .
The dorsal protein , a member of the NF- « B/Re !
family ( 29 , 62 ) , and v-Rel , the viral counterpart of c-Rel ( 8 , 18 , 28 ) , can indeed function both as positive and negative regulators .
There are also other examples of transcription factors with dual activities ( 14 , 22 , 40 ) .
Thus , despite its transcriptional activating potentials , c-Rel may also function as a negative regulator .
Although IL-6 is produced by diverse types of cells ( 35 ) , IL-6 production by normal T and B cells appears to be rare ( 31 , 65 ) .
However , aberrant IL-6 production in several malignant cells of T- or B-cell lineages and its relationship to several diseases , including malignancy , have been reported ( 26 , 33 , 35 , 65 , 67 ) .
In particular , IL-6 has been purified , and its cDNA has been cloned from HTLV-l-infected T-cell lines ( 26 ) .
In the present study , we have shown that while the IL-6 « B motif is virtually unresponsive to TNF in Jurkat T cells , the expression of HTLV-1 Tax results in a significant , albeit low , activation of IL-6 « B reporter genes .
In addition , we observed that an IL-6 promoter/CAT reporter gene having a defective IL-6 « B site is unresponsive to Tax in Jurkat cells ( unpublished data ) .
These results suggest that aberrant IL-6 production by HTLV-l-infected T cells ( 26 , 65 ) is mediated by Tax through IL-6kB as in the IL-2 receptor a gene activation by Tax , which is dependent on the IL-2 receptor kB motif ( 7 , 41 ) .
However , it is not clear at present how Tax alleviates the repression of the IL-6 « B activity in Jurkat cells , though TNF and Tax are apparently equally effective in the activation of NF- « B in Jurkat cells ( 7 , 41 , 45 , 54 ) .
One provocative possibility is that Tax directly or indirectly modulates the formation or activity of IL-6 « B BFII , which we postulate to be an repressor .
In this context , it is noteworthy that the IL-1B gene , which is not expressed normally in lymphoid cells but is aberrantly expressed in HTLV-1-infected T cells ( 66 ) , has an AT-rich « B motif ( 15 ) ( Table 1 ) similar to IL-6 « kB .
In addition , several other cytokine genes ( beta interferon , IP-10 , and IL-8 genes ; Table 1 ) also have IL-6 « B-related xB motifs in their promoters ( 39 , 46 , 50 ) .
Thus , the expression of these cytokine genes , including the IL-6 gene , may be under similar negative control mechanisms through IL-6kB-related motifs in lymphoid cells .
