Matija Peterlin From Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Departments of Medicine , Microbiology and Immunology , University of California , at San Francisco , San Francisco , California 94143-0724 Summary The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) and B cell octamer-binding protein 1/octamer-binding factor 1/Oct coactivator from B cells ( Bob1/OBF-1/OCA-B ) represent two B cell-specific transcriptional coactivators .
CIHITA and Bobl interact with proteins that bind to conserved upstream sequences in promoters of class I major histocompatibility genes and octamer-binding transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 , respectively .
Both CIITA and Bob1 increase the expression from the DRA promoter , which is a prototypic class II promoter .
Moreover , in the presence of CIITA , interactions between class II promoters and Bobi are independent of the octamer-binding site .
Using in vivo and in vitro binding assays , we confirm that Bob1 binds to CIITA .
Thus , CIITA not only activates the expression of class II genes but recruits another B cell-specific coactivator to increase transcriptional activity of class II promoters in B cells .
ranscription of MHC class II genes ( class II ) is regulated by promoter elements , which consist of conserved upstream sequences ( CUS ) called the S , X , and Y boxes and downstream sequences , which in the DRA promoter , include an octamer-binding site ( OBS ) !
( see Fig .
1 ) ( for reviews see references 1-5 ) .
Whereas the B cell-specific and IFN-y-inducible expression depend absolutely on the X box ( 6 ) , these other promoter sequences are also required for optimal levels of class II transcription ( 7 ) .
Moreover , mutations in proteins , which interact with the X box , result in a severe combined immunodeficiency called the type II bare lymphocyte syndrome ( BLSI ) ( 1 , 8 ) .
Genes mutated in two of the four complementation groups of BLSII have been isolated ( 9 , 10 } .
Of these , the regulatory factor X5 ( RFX5 ) is a component of the RFX hetero-dimer , which binds to the X box ( 10 ) .
In contrast , the class II transactivator ( CHTA ) does not bind directly to DNA ( 9 ) .
CIITA is expressed at high levels in B cells and activated T cells but is also induced by IFN-y and mediates effects of IFN-y on the expression of class II in APCs ( 11 , 12 ) .
Moreover , the absence of CHTA has been correlated with the extinction of class II on plasma cells ( 13 ) .
Recently , the gene coding for the coactivator involved in the B cell-specific transcription of Ig genes was identified ( 10 , 11 ) .
B cell octamer-binding protein 1/octamer-binding factor 1/Oct coactivator from B cells ( Bob1/OBF- 'Abbreviations used in this paper : Bob1 , B cell octamer-binding protein 1 ; CITA , Class II transactivator ; OBS , octamer-binding site .
2517 1/OCA-B ; hereafter Bob1 ) binds to Oct-1 and Oct-2 and increases their ability to activate transcription in B cells ( 14-16 ) .
Since the DRA promoter contains an OBS , we wondered if Bob1 also regulates its expression .
Indeed , Bob1 activated the DRA promoter and acted synergistically with CIITA .
Using the DQB promoter , which does not contain an OBS , and a DRA promoter bearing clustered point mutations in the OBS , we also demonstrated that this synergism was independent of the OBS .
Furthermore , Bob1 bound to CHTA in vivo and in vitro , which explains their cooperative interactions in activating the transcription of class II genes .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture , Transfection , and CAT Assay .
- Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI containing 10 % FCS and antibiotics , under 5 % CO , .
Transfections were performed by electroporation ( 960 mF , 250 V ) using 10 '' cells in 0.4 ml RPMI .
Unless otherwise stated , the total amount of DNA was kept constant at 40 mg .
Specific amounts of DNA for each transfection are noted in the figure legends .
48 h after transfection , cells were harvested , and CAT enzymatic assays were performed as described ( 17 ) .
In Vitro Protein Binding Assays .
- Glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) CIITA fusion protein was produced using the baculovirus Bacu-loGold expression system from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) .
GST protein was produced in bacteria , from the plasmid pGEX2tk ( Promega Corp. , Madison , WI ) , as described ( 18 ) .
Equal amounts of GST or GSTCIITA were bound to glutathione-sepharose beads ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) in EBC-D buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 120 mM NaCl , 0.5 % NP-40 , and 5 mM dithio-threitol ) } , washed several times in EBC-D containing 0.075 % J. Exp .

To both samples , 5 ul of [ *S ] -methionine labeled Bob1 which was transcribed/trans-lated in vitro ( TNT Coupled transcription/translation kit ; Pro-mega , Corp. ) was added .
The binding reaction was mixed for 1 h at 4°C , and washed four times in EBC-D , where the concentration of NaC ] was increased to 250 mM .
The Sepharose pellet was resuspended in 25 pl of SDS-loading buffer , boiled for 10 min , and loaded onto a 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
After electro-phoresis , the gel was dried and autoradiographed overnight on ECL Hyperfilm ( Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Results Since the DRA promoter contains an OBS , we wanted to determine if Bob1 could regulate its levels of expression .
Jurkat T cells were chosen because they express neither Bob1 nor CIITA ( Fontes , J.D. , and B.M .
Peterlin , unpublished data ) .
pDRASCAT , which contains the DRA promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene ( Fig .
1 A ) ( 7 ) , was transfected alone and with increasing amounts of pCBOBI1 which directs the expression of Bob1 , into Jurkat cells .
Expression from pDRASCAT increased with increasing amounts of pCBOBI1 ( Fig 1 B ) .
At the maximum concentrations of pCBOB1 , CAT levels were ~10-fold greater than those observed with pDRASCAT alone .
This result indicates that Bob1 interacts with proteins that bind to the OBS , and activates transcription from the DRA promoter in the absence of CHTA .
We next examined the ability of Bob1 to activate transcription from the DRA promoter in the presence of CHTA .
Cotransfections of pCCIITA ( Fig .
1 A ) with pDRASCAT ( the ratio of the plasmid effector to target was 1:1 ) resulted in 12-fold higher CAT activities ( Fig .
1 C ) .
At the same ratio of the plasmid effector and target , the expression of Bob1 resulted in twofold higher CAT activities ( Fig .
1 , B and C ) .
However , when both pCCHTA and pCBOB1 were cotransfected with pDRASCAT , CAT activities increased 40-fold ( Fig .
1 C ) .
This level of activation represents greater than additive effects between Bob1 and CIITA on the DRA promoter .
Of all class II promoters , only the DRA promoter contains an OBS .
Thus , to determine if Bob1 could also activate other class II promoters alone or with CIHTA , we used the DQB promoter , which contains S , X , and Y boxes but lacks the OBS ( 19 ) .
pDQbAT ( Fig .
2 A ) was transfected alone , with pCBOB1 and with pCBOB1 and pCCIITA into Jurkat cells .
CIHTA activated the DQB promoter sixfold ( Fig .
2 B ) .
As expected , Bob1 had no effect on the expression from pDQbCAT .
However , when pCBOB1 was cotransfected with pCCIITA , CAT levels increased more than 15-fold ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Although these levels were slightly lower than those observed with the DRA promoter , they represent synergistic activation of the DQB promoter by Bobl and CIITA .
That these synergistic activities between CIITA and Bob1 were indeed independent of the OBS was also revealed by another plasmid target , pDRASM11CAT , which contains clustered point mutations in the OBS of the DRA promoter ( Fig .
2 4 ) ( 7 ) .
Fig .
2 B demonstrates that Bob1 alone could not increase expression from pDRASM11CAT .

( 4 ) Plasmid effectors pCCIITA and pCBOB1 direct the expression of their respective cDNAs from the CMV promoter .
The plasmid target pDRASCAT was described previously ( 7 ) .
( B ) Increasing amounts of pCBOB1 ( 0 , 10 , 30 , and 50 pug ) were co-transfected with a constant amount of pDRASCAT ( 10 pg ) into Jurkat cells .
In the absence of pCBOB1 , the activity of the DRA promoter was set to 1 .
Bob1 led up to 10-fold-higher levels of expression from the DRA promoter .
( C ) pCCIITA ( 10 ug ) and pCBOB1 ( 10 jpg ) alone increased expression of pDRASCAT ( 10 ug ) 12- and 2.1-fold , respectively .
Cotransfections of both pCCIITA and pCBOB1 ( 10 pg each ) resulted in synergistically increased ( 40-fold ) expression from the DRA promoter .

Standard errors of the mean were < 10 % .
However , CIITA increased the expression from this plasmid almost I9-fold , and together with Bob1 , levels of expression from pDRASM11CAT increased more than 17-fold .
Again , this increase represents greater than multiplicative effects of Bob1 and CIITA on the mutated DRA promoter that lacks the OBS .
That Bobl and CHTA could also activate synergistically the expression from class II promoters lacking the OBS led to the possibility that the two coactivators were interacting directly .

pDQbCAT contained the promoter of the DQB gene , which is a class II promoter that lacks an OBS ( Fontes and Peterlin , unpublished data ) .
Instead of the OBS ( O0 ) , DQB contains a CCAA sequence ( C ) .
pDRASM11CAT contains clustered point mutations in the OBS of pDRASCAT ( 7 ) .
Alone and together , pCCIITA and pCBOB1 were cotransfected with the indicated plasmid targets .
Amounts of DNA were as follows : 5 g of pDQbCAT , 20 ug of pCCIITA , and 20 pg of pCBOB1 ; 5 pg of pDRASM11CAT , 10 pg of pCCIITA , and 20 ug of pCBOBI1 .

These plasmid targets were used : pG1E1bCAT contains one Gal4 binding site 5 ' to the TATA box from the E1b promoter of adenovirus ( 8 ) and pDRASUASgCAT contains a single Gal4 DNA binding site ( UASg ) 5 '' to the OBS , putative TATA and Inf sequences from the DRA promoter ( 19 ) .
( B ) Indicated plasmid effectors were cotransfected with and without pCBOB1 and pG1E1bCAT or pDRASUASgCAT into Jurkat cells .
5 ug of plasmid targets ( pG1E1bCAT and pDRASUASgCAT ) , and 15 ug of plasmid effectors ( pSG424 , pSGCIITA , and pCBOB1 ) were used .

3 A ) ( 8 ) .
Using these plasmid targets , the interaction of CIITA and Bob1 was assessed in the presence and absence of the OBS .
Both plasmids were activated to well above background levels by pSGCIITA .
In fact , the expression from pG1E1bCAT and pDRAUASgCAT was increased more than 15- and 7-fold , respectively ( Fig .
3 B ) .
pCBOB1 was also cotransfected with pSG424 ( the parental vector of pSGCIITA ) and these two plasmid targets .
Bob1 had no effect on the expression from pG1E1bCAT , which does not contain the OBS .
As expected , Bobi increased twofold the expression pDRAUASgCAT , which contains the OBS ( Fig .
3 B ) .
These data were similar to those observed with pDRASCAT ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
However , results obtained when both pSGCIITA and pCBOB1 were cotransfected with these plasmid targets were more significant .
In cotransfections with pCBOB1 and pSGCIITA , the expression from pDRAUASgCAT increased 95-fold ( Fig .
3 B ) .
This finding was confirmed with pG1E1bCAT , where the same plasmid effectors increased the expression from pG1E1bCAT 90-fold .
These degrees of activation were more than multiplicative and indicate that Bob1 and CIITA interacts with each other in cells .
In control cotransfections , activation of pDRAUASgCAT and pG1E1bCAT by a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNABD and the activation domain of VP16 from the HSV was not affected by pCBOB1 , i.e. , Bob1 did not interact with an irrelevant viral transactivator ( 19 ) .
To confirm that Bob1 interacts with CIITA , a direct binding assay was performed with CIITA and Bob1 in vitro .
A fusion protein between GSTCIITA fusion protein was incubated with Bob1 translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate .
GSTCIITA was purified with glutathione-sepharose beads and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography .
Bob1 measured 40 kD ( Fig .
4 , lane 1 ) .
When combined with Bob1 , GSTCHTA also pulled down a protein of identical molecular weight ( Fig .
4 , lane 2 ) .
However , when GST alone was incubated with Bob1 , no Bob1 was detected ( Fig .
4 , lane 3 ) , indicating that interactions between Bob1 and CIITA were specific .
Thus , GSTCHTA and Bob1 bind to each other directly .
The degree of binding between Bob1 and CIITA in our gel was similar to that observed previously with Oct-1 and Bobi ( 16 , and Fontes and Peterlin , unpublished data ) .

interacts with proteins bound to class II promoters ( 20 ) and at least one human TBP-associated factor ( TAF ) ( Fontes , J.D. , and B.M .
Peterlin , unpublished data ) .
Since Bobl contains an activation domain different than that of CIITA ( 21 ) , the presence of Bob1 provides an additional surface for interactions with a second TAF .
This scenario represents a variation on the theme of transcriptional synergy revealed by two Drosophila transactivators , bicoid and humpback , which bind to DNA and contact two distinct TAFs ( 22 ) .
Cooperative interactions with general transcription factors then result in more efficient binding of TFIID at the promoter , which leads to higher rates of initiation of transcription .
From this study , it is clear that CIITA is the primary regulator of class II transcription and that effects of Bob1 are dictated by CIITA .
This observation divorces expression of class II from Ig genes in the ontogeny of B cells , where Igs are expressed before class II determinants appear and after their extinction in plasma cells ( 23 ) .
Moreover , the presence of both CIITA and Bob1 leads to the very high levels of class II in B cells , where they are required for optimal T cell help ( 24 ) .
In sharp contrast , IFN-y induces the synthesis of only CIITA in APCs ( 25 ) .
Since these cells lack Bob1 , levels of class II in APCs are lower than those in B cells and reflect only the requirement of class II for optimal antigen processing and presentation .
