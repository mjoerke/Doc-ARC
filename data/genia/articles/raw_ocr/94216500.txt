Incubation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) in hypoxia , PO , ~ 14-18 Torr , led to time-dependent release of IL-8 antigen into the conditioned medium ; this was accompanied by increased chemotactic activity for PMNs , blocked by antibody to IL-8 .
Production of IL-8 by hypoxic ECs occurred concomitantly with both increased levels of IL-8 mRNA , based on polymerase chain reaction analysis , and increased IL-8 transcription , based on nuclear run-on assays .
Northern analysis of mRNA from hypoxic ECs also demonstrated increased levels of mRNA for macrophage chemotactic protein-1 , another member of the chemokine superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines .
IL-8 gene induction was associated with the presence of increased binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic ECs for the NF-kB site .
Studies with human umbilical vein segments exposed to hypoxia also demonstrated increased elaboration of IL-8 antigen compared with normoxic controls .
In mice exposed to hypoxia ( PO , ~ 30-40 Torr ) , there was increased pulmonary leukostasis , as evidenced by increased myeloperoxidase activity in tissue homogenates .
In parallel , increased levels of transcripts for IP-10 , a murine homologue in the chemokine family related to IL-8 , were observed in hypoxic lung tissue .
Taken together , these data suggest that hypoxia constitutes a stimulus for leukocyte chemotaxis and tissue leu-kostasis .

Key words : hypoxia « leukostasis « ischemia « cytokine » chemokine Introduction There is a large pool of resident macrophages in the lung ; neu-trophils ( PMNs ) , as well as additional mononuclear phagocytes are recruited in response to inflammatory stimuli ( 1-2 ) .
Lung vasculature is also sensitive to hypoxia , as indicated by the rapid vasoconstriction which occurs with decreased oxygen tension in the alveoli ( 3 ) .
Since vascular injury and hypoxia can involve PMNs ( 4-10 ) , we have focussed on mechanisms which selectively draw leukocytes into ischemic loci .
In this context , two important mechanisms are enhanced expression Address correspondence to Dr. David Stern , Department of Physiol-ogy , Columbia University , College of Physicians and Surgeons , 630 West 168th Street , New York , NY 10032 .

surface , and the generation of chemoattractant cytokines leading to egress of PMNs from the intravascular space .
Enhanced PMN-vascular interactions have also been demonstrated in ischemic tissues in association with increased generation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( 11-14 ) , increased expression of platelet-activating factor ( 15-17 ) , as well as the increased expression of IL-1 , which occurs during hypoxemia ( H ) and reoxygenation ( R ) ( 18-19 ) .
These observations have led us to seek mechanisms through which PMNs would leave the intravascular space in hypoxic tissues .
The studies reported here demonstrate that exposure of ECs to hypoxia leads to early , de novo synthesis of IL-8 : transcription is enhanced , levels of steady state mRNA rise , and increased amounts of chemotactically active protein are elabo-rated .
Increased IL-8 production is also observed in human umbilical cord segments exposed to hypoxia , compared with normoxic controls .
Further , in a mouse model of hypoxia , a gene in the IL-8 chemokine superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines , IP-10 ( 20-22 ) , is induced and there is increased myeloperoxidase activity in the lung , consistent with PMN in-filtration .
One mechanism underlying hypoxia-mediated induction of IL-8 may be early activation of a transcription factor recognizing a nuclear factor kB ( NF-kB ) site .
The importance of understanding the expression of IL-8 in response to hypoxia is emphasized by a recent study demonstrating induction of IL-8 in mononuclear phagocytes exposed to anoxia followed by reoxygenation ( 23 ) .
To further complete the profile of IL-8 expression in H/R , our studies show that ECs , the first cells of the vessel wall which encounter PMNs , produce IL-8 during hypoxia even before the mononuclear phagocyte response during R resulting in IL-8 elaboration .
Taken together , these data contribute to an emerging picture of ischemia-driven mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response .
Methods Endothelial cell culture and exposure of cells and umbilical cord segments to H /R .
Human umbilical vein ECs were prepared from umbilical cords and grown in culture by the method of Jaffe ( 24 ) as modified by Thornton ( 25 ) .
Experiments used confluent ECs ( passages 1-4 ) grown in Medium 199 supplemented with fetal bovine serum ( 15 % ; Gemini , Calabasas , CA ) , human serum ( 5 % ; Gemini ) , endothelial growth supplement ( Sigma Immunochemicals , St. Louis , MO ) , heparin ( 90 ug/ml ; Sigma Immunochemicals ) and antibiotics , as described ( 18 ) .
When ECs achieved confluence , experiments were performed by placing cultures in an environmental chamber ( Coy Laboratory Prod 1 .

ucts , Inc. , Ann Arbor , MI ) , which provided a controlled temperature ( 37°C ) and atmosphere with the indicated amount of oxygen , carbon dioxide ( 5 % ) , and the balance made up of nitrogen .
Use of this chamber for cell culture experiments has been described previously ( 26 ) .
During exposure of ECs to hypoxia ( for a maximum of 16 h ) , the oxygen tension in the culture medium was 14-18 Torr and there was no change in the medium pH .
Reoxygenation was performed by placing ECs in an ambient atmosphere containing carbon dioxide ( 5 % ) at 37°C .
Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion and determination of lactate dehydrogenase release into the medium , as measured with a kit purchased from Sigma Immunochemicals .
For certain experiments umbilical cords were obtained immediately after delivery , washed in balanced salt solution , trimmed to remove excess adventitial tissue , and each cord was cut into pieces such as to expose the umbilical vein endothelial cell surface .
The pieces/ vessel segments were immersed in Medium 199 containing fetal bovine and human serum ( 1 % ) , and were incubated in the hypoxia chamber ( as above ) or in a normoxic incubator ( usual atmospheric culture conditions with 5 % carbon dioxide ) for 6 h. For each of three cords , IL-8 was determined by triplicate measurements comparing segments exposed to normoxia vs those segments exposed to hypoxia .
Aliquots of culture medium were assayed for IL-8 antigen in the ELISA described below .
Assays for expression of IL-8 and Northern analysis for macrophage chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) .
IL-8 antigen was quantified using a sensitive capture ELISA ( 27 ) .
Mouse monoclonal anti-neutrophil activating protein- 1 /IL-8 IgG ( Sandoz Forschungsinstitut , Vienna , Aus-tria ) was used to coat wells of microtiter plates for 16 h at 4°C .
After washing four times with phosphate-buffered saline ( Gibco Laborato-ries , Grand Island , NY ) containing Tween 20 ( 0.05 % ) , purified human recombinant IL-8 ( Sandoz , Basel , Switzerland ) at concentrations of 0.02-10 ng/ml or conditioned media from EC cultures was added to the precoated wells for 2 h at 37°C .
Plates were rinsed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 , as above , and goat anti-IL-8 IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added for an additional 2 h at 37°C .
Next , substrate , p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added , and plates were further incubated to allow color development , followed by termination of the reaction with NaOH ( 2 N ) .
Absorbance was read at 405 nm , and the detection limit in this assay was 3.0 pg/ml .
The experiment was repeated on five separate occasions , and the results are expressed as fold increase in IL-8 production over normoxic controls .
Assays for PMN chemotaxis were performed in modified chemotaxis chambers as described previously ( 28-29 ) .
In brief , to harvest PMNs , blood from healthy donors was drawn into EDTA ( final con-centration , 5 mM ) , and diluted 1:1 with NaCl ( 0.9 % ) followed by gradient ultracentrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Leukocyte chemotaxis was performed in 48-well chemotaxis chambers ( Neuro Probe , Bethesda , MD ) containing a 5-um nucleopore polycarbonate membrane ( Nucleopore Corp. , Pleasanton , CA ) .
PMNs were suspended in serum-free Medium 199 ( Gibco Laboratories ) and 10* cells were added per well to the upper chamber .
The lower chamber contained either conditioned medium from hypoxic ECs , purified IL-8 , or medium alone .
The chamber was incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified air atmosphere containing carbon dioxide ( 5 % ) , and after 30 min , the membrane was washed , fixed in methanol , and Wright stained .
Nine high power fields were counted per sample , and each experiment was done in triplicate .
The results are expressed as the mean of three experiments .
PCR analysis of IL-8 transcripts was assessed in cultured ECs exposed to normoxia , hypoxia , or H/R , and total RNA was extracted using the acid-guanidinium thiocyanate procedure ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
Random hexanucleotide-primed first-strand cDNA was prepared and served as a template for PCR analysis .
IL-8 primers were those described by Carre et al .
( 30 ) and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) primers ( 19 ) were 5° CCA CCC ATG GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA 3 ' ( sense ) and 5 TCT AGA CGG CAG GTC AGG TCC ACC 3 ' ( antisense ) .
cDNA was amplified by PCR for 30 cycles , each cycle consisting of incubations at 94°C for 1 min , 50°C for 2 min , and 72°C for 2 min .
Products were analyzed by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under ultraviolet light , transferred to nylon membranes , and Southern hybridization was performed using P-labeled cDNA encoding full-length human IL-8 .
In control studies , the same cDNA was amplified with human GAPDH primers described above .
Detection of a murine homologue in the chemokine family related to IL-8 ( IP-10 ) and KC mRNA was also done using PCR amplification of cDNA generated by reverse transcription using RNA from lung tissue of mice exposed to hypoxia ( see below ) as the sample .
5 ug of each RNA was used as starting material for the reverse transcription reaction in a total volume of 18 ul , and 9 Ll of the latter reaction product was then amplified by PCR .
Primers used for IP-10 were sense ( 5 ' AAC CCA AGT GCT GCC 3 '' ) and antisense ( 5 ACC ATG GCT TGA CCA 3 ' ) , and for KC were sense ( 5° TCG CTT CTC TGT GCA GCG CT 3 ' ) and antisense ( 5 ' GTG GTT GAC ACT TAG TGG TCT C 3 ' ) ( 20-22 ) .
Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60°C .
After amplification , 20 Ll of reaction product was separated by agarose gel ( 1 % ) electrophoresis , stained with ethidium bromide , and blotted onto nylon membranes for Southern hybridiza-tion .
The blots were hybridized with a radiolabeled cDNA probe for IP-10 using standard methodologies .
Northern analysis for MCP-1 was performed on total cellular RNA extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate method , as above .
Equal amounts of RNA ( 8 ug ) were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose formaldehyde gel as previously described ( 30 ) .
The RNA was then blotted by capillary transfer to nylon mem-branes .
The blots were prehybridized for 6-8 h at 42°C in formamide ( 50 % ) , SDS ( 1 % ) , SSC ( 5x ) , Denhardt 's solution ( 1 % ; Ficoll , 0.02 % ; bovine serum albumin , 0.02 % ; polyvinylpyrrolidone , 0.02 % ) , denatured herring testes DNA ( 0.25 mg/ml ) , and sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 6.5 ; 50 mM ) .
Hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 12-18 h with MCP-1 probe obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) ( 10 '' cpm in each case ) .
Filters were washed ( SDS , 0.01 % ; SSC , 0.5 % ) for 15 min at room temperature followed by a wash ( SDS , 0.1 % ; SSC , 0.5 % ) at 65°C .
Blots were then exposed to film ( XAR-5 ; Eastman Kodak Co. , Rochester , NY ) with intensifying screens ( Cronex Lightening Plus ; Du Pont Pharmaceuticals , Wilming-ton , DE ) at 70°C .
Expression of GAPDH was used as an internal control for the quantity of total mRNA .
In addition , the RNA per lane was assessed by ethidium bromide staining of the original agarose gel after capillary transfer .
Nuclear run-on assays for IL-8 , GAPDH , and B-actin .
Isolation of nuclei and in vitro transcription were performed basically as described ( 31 , 32 ) .
Briefly , EC cultures exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 3 h were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline , lysed in NP-40-containing buffer ( Tris/HCl , 10 mM , pH 7.4 ; NaCl , 10 mM ; 3 mM ; NP-40 , 0.5 % ) , incubated on ice for 5 min , and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min .
Nuclei were washed in lysis buffer , resuspended in storage buffer ( 0.2 ml ; Tris/ HCI , 50 mM , pH 8.3 ; glycerol , 40 % ; MgCl , , 5 mM ; EDTA , 0.1 mM ) , and kept at -80°C before use .
For in vitro transcription , the nuclei from normoxic or hypoxic ECs ( 7.2 x 10° ) were thawed and mixed with equal volume of reaction buffer ( Tris/HCI , 10 mM , pH 8.0 ; MgCl , , 5 mM ; KCI , 300 mM ) containing 1 mM each of ATP , CTP , and GTP , and [ a- P ] UTP ( 200 4Ci , 3,000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min , and P-labeled RNA was then isolated and precipitated with ethanol .
RNA was hybridized to linearized plasmid DNA ( IL-8 , GAPDH , and -actin ) , and immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes for 36 h at 65°C , as described ( 31 ) .
Filters were washed in SSC ( 2 % ) at 65°C three times for 30 min each , incubated at 37°C with ribonuclease A ( 10 ug/ml ) , washed again , air dried , and exposed to Kodak x-ray film as above .
Nuclear extracts and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from normoxic and hypoxic ECs , or from endothelial cultures exposed to purified recombinant human TNF ( 5 nM ) ( generously provided by Dr. P. Lomedico , Hoffmann-La Roche Interleukin-8 and Hypoxia _ 1565 Inc. , Nutley , NJ ) for 3 h by the method of Dignam and Roeder ( 33 ) .
These extracts were prepared in an environment with the same ambient oxygen tension as that in the experiment ( extracts from hypoxic cultures were prepared under hypoxia ) .
Complementary 30-bp oligonucleotides representing a portion of the human IL-8 gene promoter containing a putative NF-kB site ( 34-35 ) or mouse NF-kB binding site ( 36-37 ) were used : for IL-8 , these included 5° CCC CAA ATC GTG GAA TTT CCT CTG AGA TAA 3 ' ( NF-kB1 ) and 5° GGG TTA TGT CAG AGG AAA TTC CAC GAT TTG 3 ' ( NF-kB2 ) ; for mouse NF-kB these included 5° CCC CAG AGG GGA CTT TCC GAG AGG CTC 3 ( NF-kB1 ) and 55 GGG GAG CCT CTC GGA AAG TCC CCT CTG 3 ' ( NF-kB2 ) .
Oligonucleotides were annealed and 3 ' end-labeled with [ a-P ] dCTP and dGTP with Klenow polymerase via standard procedures ( 38 ) .
Binding reactions were performed by preincubating 7.5 ug of nuclear extract protein in Hepes ( 20 mM ; pH 7.9 ) , KCI ( 60 mM ) , MgCl , ( 1 mM ) , EDTA ( 0.1 M ) , glycerol ( 10 % ) , dithiothreitol ( 0.5 mM ) , and poly ( dI-dC ; 2 ug ) on ice for 10 min , followed by addition of the double stranded P-labeled oligonucleotide ( ~ 0.2 ng ) and a second incubation at room temperature for 20 min .
Samples were loaded directly onto nondenaturing 6 % polyacrylamide gels ( 29 : 1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ) prepared in Tris ( 45 mM ) -boric acid ( 45 mM ) -EDTA ( 0.1 M ) ( 0.5 x TBE ) .
Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 3-4 h at a current of 15 mA .
Supershift experiments were performed as described above except that 1 Ll of antibody to the NF-kB binding protein p50 or p65 were added to the binding mixture in the absence of the labelled probe .
This mixture was then incubated on ice for 45 min before probe addition .
Antisera specifically recognizing pSO ( anti-SP1141 from the N terminus of p105 ) ( 39 ) or p65 ( anti-SP1226 from the N H ; terminus of p65 ) ( 39 ) were generously provided by Dr. N. Rice ( Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , MD ) .
The gels were then dried and exposed to Kodak XRP film with intensifying screens .
For competition studies , unlabeled probe for Sp1 ( 40 ) was also used : 5° GCT CCA GGC GGG GGC GGG GCC CGG GTT CGG 3 ' ( Sp-1-1 # ) and 5° CCG AAC CCG GGC CCC GCC CCC GCC TGG AGC 3 ' ( Sp-1-2 # ) .
Experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides used a 100-fold molar excess relative to the radiolabeled oligonucleotide .
Determination of leukostasis and expression of IP-10/KC in lungs of hypoxic mice .
Mice were subjected to hypoxia as previously described ( 26 ) and reoxygenated using a controlled environmental chamber .
Animals were placed in the chamber and allowed free access to food and water , the system parameters were adjusted to a final oxygen concentration of 8-10 % oxygen with the balance of the gas mixture being made up of nitrogen .
At the indicated times , mice were killed , and lung was tissue collected for RNA extraction using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate method as described above .
PCR and Southern blotting were performed as described above using primers for IP-10 and KC .
Pulmonary leukostasis was assessed by determining myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) activity using previously described methods ( 41-42 ) .
Mice ( hypoxic , n = 3 ; normoxic , n = 3 ) were anesthetized , lungs were rinsed with saline to remove residual blood , and then lungs were excised from the chest cavity and homogenized in phosphate buffer ( 50 mM ; pH 6.0 ) containing hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ( 0.5 % ) on ice .
The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 g for 10 min at 4°C , and the supernatant decanted .
The pellet was freeze thawed and resuspended in the same buffer ( hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bro-mide ) .
This extraction procedure was repeated three times , the extracts were pooled , and MPO activity assayed using the standard chromo-genic spectrophotometric technique ( 20 , 21 ) .
The test sample ( 0.1 ml ) was added to 2.9 mi of phosphate buffer ( 50 mM ; pH 6.0 ) containing O-dianisidine dihydrochloride ( Sigma Immunochemicals ) and hydrogen peroxide ( 0.0005 % ) , and change in absorbance at 460 nm was measured during 5 min ( increase in OD was linear during this time interval ) .
Results shown are the means of three observations + SEM .
Data analysis .
IL-8 ELISA and chemotaxis data were evaluated using analysis of variance , with the Tukey procedure used to discriminate significant differences between group means .
When two variables 1566 Karakurum et al .
were compared , the Student 's / test was used for unpaired ( myeloper-oxidase data ) or paired ( umbilical cord segment data ) variables .
Data were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05 .
Results Elaboration of IL-8 by ECs exposed to hypoxia .
When ECs were placed in an hypoxic atmosphere ( Po , ~ 14-18 Torr ) , IL-8 antigen was released into the culture medium in a time-dependent manner ; increasing over time to ~ 1 ng/ml by 16 h ( Fig .

( 4 ) Elaboration of IL-8 antigen .
Confluent ECs were incubated in serum-free medium 199 in an hypoxic atmosphere ( medium Po , ~ 14-18 Torr ) for the indicated times .
Aliquots of the culture supernatants were assayed for the presence of immunoreactive IL-8 by ELISA .
The y-axis indicates the rise in IL-8 antigen above that detectable in the conditioned medium of normoxic controls and is the mean of five separate experiments .

( B ) Induction of PMN chemotaxis .
Aliquots of conditioned medium from hypoxic EC cultures ( 16 h ) were added alone ( darkened bars ) or in the presence of the indicated concentration of anti- ( a ) -IL-8 IgG to the lower compartment of modified chemotaxis chambers .
Where in-dicated , conditioned medium from normoxic ECs ( 16 h ; open bar ) or purified IL-8 ( 1 ng/ml ; cross-hatched bar ) was added to chemotaxis chambers .
PMNs ( 10*/well ) were placed in the upper chamber , and the assay was continued for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified ambient air atmosphere , as described in the text .

*P < 0.05. elaborated for up to 4 h ( data not shown ) .
Concomitantly , chemotactic activity for PMNs was observed in the conditioned medium from hypoxic EC cultures , which could be completely blocked in the presence of monospecific anti-IL-8 anti-body , whereas nonimmune IgG was without effect ( Fig .
1 B ) .
Note that IL-8 used as a positive control stimulated PMN migration at about the concentration present in conditioned medium from hypoxic ECs .
The increase in IL-8 production was observed only when the Po ; was low ( 14-18 Torr ) and was not seen at higher oxygen tensions .
Release of IL-8 into the conditioned medium was not a result of cell death ( even at the longest times of exposure to hypoxia , 16 h in these experiments ) , as cell viability was unaffected : cells remained adherent as a confluent monolayer , excluded trypan blue , and did not release increased amounts of lactate dehydrogenase .
As a first step in extrapolating these data back to an intact vessel , elaboration of IL-8 antigen in human umbilical cord segments , in which pieces of umbilical vein were exposed to hypoxia , were studied .
In these experiments , the hypoxic segments demonstrated increased amounts of IL-8 antigen compared with normoxic controls ( Fig .
2 ) .
Although multiple cells in the vessel wall could contribute to the observed IL-8 produc-tion , taken together with the data in cell culture , these results are consistent with increased elaboration of IL-8 by hypoxic vasculature .
In parallel with increased levels of IL-8 in conditioned media from hypoxic cultured ECs , PCR analysis showed enhanced levels of IL-8 mRNA ( Fig .
3 4 ) .
Southern blotting of the PCR products with a cDNA for IL-8 confirmed the identity of these amplicons ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Amplification of the same cDNA for GAPDH demonstrated that levels of transcript for this constitutive enzyme were unaffected by hypoxia , confirming preferential induction of IL-8 mRNA ( Fig .
3 C ) .
Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that hypoxia increased transcription of IL-8 , whereas transcription of the housekeeping gene B-actin was largely unchanged ( Fig .
3 D ) .
Since total transcription was decreased in hypoxia by 67 % ( data not shown ) , this suggests the specificity of the hypoxic stimulus for induction of IL-8 .
These data are consistent with increased IL-8 synthesis in hypoxia , resulting from enhanced transcription , translation , and release of chemotactically active protein .
In support of upregulation of genes in the chemokine superfamily of cytokines , increased transcripts of MCP-1 were observed on Northern analysis of RNA from hypoxic ECs compared with normoxic controls ( Fig .
4 ) .
Enhanced levels of MCP-1 mRNA were evident 30-60 min after placement in hypoxia and were increased up to 2 h , thereafter falling off to the normoxic baseline by 4 h. Figure 2 .

Mechanisms of hypoxia-induced IL-8 production .
Reactive oxygen intermediates , whose formation is often related to changes in intracellular redox potential , have been shown to induce nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kB ( 43 ) .
Since a sequence element resembling an NF-kB recognition motif is present in the human IL-8 promoter , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a synthetic , double-stranded DNA probe representing this portion of the IL-8 promoter ( Fig .
5 ) .

Exposure of ECs to hypoxic conditions for 3 h resulted in a substantial increase in the binding capacity of one of these species ( see lane 3 ) , indicated as the hypoxia-enhanced species .
The binding of this protein ( s ) to the probe is sequence specific , since an excess of the unlabeled human IL-8 promoter probe ( lane 4 ) or of a probe containing a known murine NF-kB binding site ( lane 5 ) virtually abolished binding to the labeled probe , whereas a similar molar excess of an unrelated probe containing a known Sp-1 binding site did not ( lane 6 ) .
The fact that both probes which contain known or putative NF-kB binding sites compete for binding of the hypoxia-induced species strongly suggests that this protein ( s ) recognizes an NF-kB site .
Since NF-kB is one member of a family of transcription factors that bind to similar recognition sequences ( 36-37 ) , we sought to determine whether the hypoxia-induced species is authentic NF-kB ( i.e. , the p50/p65 heterodimer ) or a distinct species .
Since TNF is a known inducer of NF-kB in ECs ( 44 ) , normoxic cultures were exposed to TNF and tested for binding activities that could specifically recognize the known NF-kB probe ( Fig .
5 , lanes 7-9 ) .
A major binding species , designated TNF-enhanced species ( lanes 7-12 ) is observed in nuclear extracts from TNF-treated ECs .
The sequence specificity of DNA binding by these protein ( s ) for a probe comprised of a known murine NF-kB sequence ( 33-34 ) is demonstrated by competition with excess unlabeled murine NF-kB probe ( lane 10 ; the appearance of the TNF-enhanced band is completely abolished ) or unlabeled human IL-8 NF-kB probe ( lane 12 ; the appearance of the TNF-enhanced band is diminished , but not completely abolished , suggesting that the TNF-induced binding proteins interact with this probe with a lower affinity than with the mouse NF-kB probe ) .
In contrast , addition of excess unlabeled Sp-1 probe had no effect on the intensity of the TNF-enhanced band .
To determine that the TNF-induced species binding to NF-kB was authentic NF-kB , 1568 Karakurum et al .

Lanes 7-6 and 13-15 contain the labeled probe representing the human IL-8 promoter , lanes 7-72 contain the mouse probe .
FP , unbound free probe .
Additions are indicated above each lane , and details of methods are described in the text .
supershift experiments were performed with antisera to the p50 and p65 components of NF-kB .
The results demonstrate that the TNF enhanced species is shifted by both the anti-p50 ( lane 8 ) and anti-p65 antisera ( lane 9 ) .
In conjunction with the competition data , these data are strong evidence that the species induced by TNF is authentic NF-kB .
In contrast , supershift experiments with the same antibodies did not result in a shift of the hypoxia-enhanced species ( lane 14 , anti-p50 IgG ; lane 15 , anti-p65 IgG ) .
The different mobility of the hypoxia-enhanced species relative to NF-kB in the gel mobility shift assay suggests that although it binds to NF-kB binding sites , it is distinct from authentic NF-kB .
Effect of hypoxia on leukostasis and induction of murine members of the IL-8-related family of chemokines in the mouse .
Mice exposed to hypoxia demonstrated increased pulmonary leukostasis , as measured by MPO assays ( Fig .
6 4 ) .
These results led us to examine if hypoxia was a stimulus for induction of cytokines in the IL-8-related murine family of chemoattractant polypeptides in vivo .
A fragment corresponding to the expected 475-bp PCR product from IP-10 mRNA was observed at 4 and 8 h after exposure to hypoxia and declined after 24 h ( Fig .
6 B ) .
IP-10 mRNA was not detected in normoxic control animals .
Southern blotting with IP-10 cDNA confirmed the identity of the amplicon ( Fig .
6 C ) .
In contrast , no induction of gro ( KC ) mRNA was observed .
Discussion Exposure of ECs to hypoxia and hypoxia /reoxygenation sets in motion events that promote margination and migration of PMNs into the interstitium .
Previous studies have demonstrated mechanisms through which ECs subjected to hypoxia , as well as reoxygenation have increased capacity to bind PMNs ( 18 , 45 ) .
EC generation of a chemotactic polypeptide in ischemic loci could enhance the participation of circulating PMNs in the inflammatory response .

Effect of hypoxia on pulmonary leukostasis and activation of genes in the IL-8-related family in vivo .
Mice were exposed to hypoxia ( Po , ~ 30-40 Torr , n = 3 ) or normoxia ( ambient PO ; , n = 3 ) .
( A ) Lungs were harvested at 16 h and processed for MPO activity .
The y-axis shows the fold increase in MPO activity in hypoxic mouse lung as compared with normoxic controls ( mean + SEM ) .
*P < 0.05 .
( B ) Lungs were harvested at 4 , 8 , and 22 h of hypoxia , RNA was extracted , and PCR was performed using primers for IP-10 .
The arrow indicates the position of the expected 475-bp PCR product .
( C ) Southern hybridization of these amplicons with a radiolabeled IP-10 cDNA .
oxia results in the production of the chemotactic cytokine IL-8 , providing insight into a means through which ECs facilitate emigration of PMNs from the intravascular space , either by releasing IL-8 or , potentially , displaying this polypeptide on the cell surface ( 46-47 ) .
After their adherence to the EC , PMNs emigrate to the extravascular tissues , where they fulfill their role in host defense .
Although pathways underlying enhanced EC expression of IL-8 in hypoxia remain to be clarified , the association of this phenomenon with activation of an NF-kB-related transcription factor may be an important mechanism driving transcription .
Consistent with the presence of NF-kB and C/EBP binding sites in the promoter of the human IL-8 gene , NF-kB , along with a C/EBP-like factor , can drive expression of IL-8 ( 35 ) .
The different mobility of the hypoxia-induced NF-kB species , compared with that observed in EC cultures exposed to TNF , as well as the supershift experiments with anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies , indicates that a species distinct from authentic NF-kB may be involved in transcriptional activation in hypoxic cultures .
In view of the evolving recognition of the diverse and complex nature of the NF-kB-related family of molecules ( 36-37 ) , it is not surprising that different stimuli might use distinct pathways to initiate transcription of target genes .
The stimulus for activation of NF-kB site binding activity in hypoxic ECs could result from several possible mechanisms .
For example , hypoxia-induced production of EC IL-1 could result in autocrine activation of NF-kB site binding activity .
The latter seems unlikely , as induction of IL-1 mRNA and elaboration of IL-1 activity from hypoxic ECs occurs later than activation of NF-kB binding site activity and induction of IL-8 ( 18 ) .
In support of this , anti-IL-1 antibodies and IL-1 receptor antagonist had no effect on hypoxia-induced IL-8 production .
Studies are in progress to delineate mechanisms which are in-volved .
Our data in the mouse model of hypoxia , also suggest potential hypoxia-induced activation of other members of the IL-8-related family of proinflammatory polypeptides .
Induction of IP-10 is associated with inflammation , for example its production is stimulated by T cell-derived lymphokines ( IFN-y , IL-2 , TNF ) and bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide , although the biologic activities of IP-10 have not been fully defined ( 22 ) .
To gain further insight into possible upregulation of the murine IL-8 gene in hypoxia , we obtained a recently cloned cDNA which appears to be the murine counterpart of IL-8 ( 30 % identical and 50 % homologous to human IL-8 ) ( Wein-stein , I.B. , and W. Jing , manuscript in preparation ) , and performed Northern analysis on RNA harvested from hypoxic mouse lung tissue .
The intensity of a band corresponding to the IL-8 mRNA increased in hypoxia at the 1- , 2- , and 4-h time points , compared with normoxic controls .
These observations are consistent with the leukostasis observed with hypoxia in vivo , and the results with cultured ECs and with umbilical cord segments demonstrating increased elaboration of IL-8 antigen on exposure to hypoxia .
Taken together , these data indicate that hypoxia enhances EC transcription , translation , and release of the IL-8 gene prod-uct , potentially attracting PMNs to areas of regional ischemia .
The combined effects of EC production of IL-8 during hypoxia , and monocyte elaboration of IL-8 during reoxygenation ( 8 ) could lead to a synergistic mechanism through which leukocytes are drawn into the interstitium .
Thus , regional hyp-oxia/hypoxemia could serve as a priming stimulus that initiates a local inflammatory response after reoxygenation /reper-fusion .
