4 The Myeloid-Cell-Specific c-fes Promoter Is Regulated by Sp1 , PU.1 , and a Novel Transcription Factor AHLKE HEYDEMANN , ' GEORGE JUANG , '' KATHLEEN HENNESSY , ** MICHAEL S. PARMACEK , '' anp M. CELESTE SIMON®* > * Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology , Department of Medicine , '' and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , '' University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 Received 18 October 1995/Returned for modification 4 December 1995/Accepted 21 December 1995 The protein product of the c-fps/fes ( c-fes ) proto-oncogene has been implicated in the normal development of myeloid cells ( macrophages and neutrophils ) .
mRNA for c-fes has been detected exclusively in myeloid cells and vascular endothelial cells in adult mammals .
Although a 13-kilobase-pair ( kb ) human c-fes transgene exhibits high levels of expression in mice , the sequences that confer myeloid-cell-specific expression of the human ¢-fes gene have not been defined .
Transient-transfection experiments demonstrated that plasmids containing 446 bp of c-fes 5 ' -flanking sequences linked to a luciferase reporter gene were active exclusively in myeloid cells .
No other DNA elements within the 13-kb human c-fes locus contained positive cis-acting elements , with the exception of a weakly active region within the -flanking sequences .
DNase I footprinting assays revealed four distinct sites that bind myeloid nuclear proteins ( -408 to -386 , -293 to -254 , -76 to -65 , and -34 to +3 ) .
However , the first two footprints resided in sequences that were largely dispensable for transient activity .
Plasmids containing 151 bp of 5'-flanking sequences confer myeloid-cell-specific gene expression .
Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that the 151-bp region contains nuclear protein binding sites for Sp1 , PU.1 , and/or Elf-1 , and a novel factor .
This unidentified factor binds immediately 3 ' of the PU.1/Elf-1 site and appears to be myeloid cell specific .
Mutation of the PU.1/Elf-1 site or the 3 ' site ( FP4-3 ' ) within the context of the c-fes promoter resulted in substantially reduced activity in transient transfections .
Furthermore , transient-cotransfection assays demonstrated that PU.1 ( and not Elf-1 ) can transactivate the c-fes promoter in nonmyeloid cell lines .
We conclude that the human c-fes gene contains a strong myeloid-cell-specific promoter that is regulated by Sp1 , PU.1 , and a novel transcription factor .
During mammalian development , specific cells within the mesoderm differentiate into pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells that form all blood cell types , including lymphocytes , megakaryocytes , erythrocytes , granulocytes , and monocytes .
Proto-oncogenes have been implicated in the regulation of cellular differentiation .
Several mammalian proto-oncogenes exhibit restricted patterns of expression , suggesting that their transcription is tightly controlled and that they encode proteins with lineage-specific functions ( 30 , 33 , 38 ) .
The c-fps/fes ( here-in referred to as c-fes ) proto-oncogene encodes a 92-kDa cy-toplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase that includes a Src homology 2 domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain ( 29 ) .
c-fes is distinct from members of the Sre family of tyrosine kinases in that it lacks a negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site in its carboxyl-terminal region , is not modified by N-terminal myristylation , and does not have a Sre homology 3 domain .
Previously , the c-fes protein ( p92 ) had been detected only in hematopoietic cells in adult mammals and birds , predominantly in differentiated neutrophils and macrophages and their precursors ( 7 , 17 , 19 , 29 , 32 ) .
However , more recent experiments have shown that c-fes is also expressed in vascular endothelial cells and several rapidly proliferating embryonic tissues ( 3 , 10 ) .
A requirement for p92 '' in myeloid-cell ( monocyte and neutrophil ) development has been suggested by a number of experiments .

1676 mic ( K562 ) cells induces them to undergo terminal myeloid differentiation ( 40 ) .
c-fes kinase activity increases following treatment of HL60 cells with the granulocyte inducer retinoic acid and monocyte inducers such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 32 , 39 ) .
Furthermore , inhibition of c-fes expression with antisense oligonucleotides in HL60 cells before induction with retinoic acid leads to the activation of programmed cell death ( 8 , 20 ) .
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and interleukin-3 are potent hematopoietic growth factors which stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of various hematopoietic cells , including granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells .
One study reported a direct association between p92 '' and the common B chain of the human interleukin-3 and GM-CSF receptors that is catalytically activated upon ligand binding ( 13 ) .
These observations suggest that p92 '' is involved in regulating proliferation and differentiation during myelopoiesis .
It may also be essential for the survival of myeloid cells during differentiation .
A 13-kilobase-pair ( kb ) c-fes human genomic construct is expressed in transgenic mice in a tissue-specific manner and at levels comparable to that of the endogenous murine gene ( 11 ) .
Furthermore , expression of the human transgene in mouse bone marrow is independent of the integration site and proportional to the transgene copy number .
Remarkably , this 13-kb genomic fragment includes only 446 bp of 5'- and 1.4 kb of 3'-flanking sequences and must , by definition , include all cis-acting DNA elements required for high levels of myeloid-cell-specific expression .
To locate where these cis-acting elements reside and to identify trans-acting factors which bind to them , we have studied the expression of various c-fes DNA elements linked to a reporter gene in transient-transfection Vou .
16 , 1996 assays in two myeloid cell lines .
We report that the 5'-flanking 151 bp of c-fes contain a strong myeloid-cell-specific promoter .
This promoter contains functionally important binding sites for Sp1 , PU.1 , and a novel transcription factor .
Also , PU.1 transactivates the promoter in nonmyeloid cell lines .
MATERIALS AND METHODS RNase protection assay .
Total RNA was isolated from the following human-derived cell lines : Hela , Jurkat , K562 , U937 , HL60 , and THP-1 .
In addition , a separate flask of U937 cells was treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) at 54 nM for 16 h prior to RNA isolation .
All cell lines were passaged 1:3 24 h prior to RNA extraction to ensure that cells were healthy .
The TRIzol reagent ( Gibco/BRL ) for RNA purification was used as specified by the manufacturer except that two rounds of extraction were performed to completely remove contaminating genomic DNA .
Antisense ¢-fes and B-actin RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase and linearized plasmids .
The c-fes probe corresponds to genomic DNA positions 11273 through 11645 ( GenBank accession number X06292 ) and protects 273 bp of exon 19 .
The B-actin construct ( Ambion ) produces a 189-bp transcript and protects a 127-bp fragment .
Analysis was performed as recommended by the manufacturer .
Plasmid construction .
Plasmid pSVBR91 contains the 13-kb EcoRI human c-fes genomic locus and was kindly provided by A. J. M. Rocbrock .
Plasmid p446 contains the c-fes promoter ( bp -446 to +71 ) cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter pGL2-basic ( Promega ) .
The 517-bp EcoRI-KpnI fragment from pSVBR91 was subcloned into Smel-Kpnl-digested pGL2 .
A series of 5 '' deletions were made by subcloning a BssHII-KprI fragment ( yielding p366 ) , an Eagl-KpnI fragment ( yielding p151 ) , and a Smel-KpnI fragment ( yielding p31 ) into pGL2 .
The p251 and p99 constructs were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified products into pGL2-basic .
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the following oligonucleotides : for PU.1 , 5-GGGGCCTGGGCCAACTGA AACCGCGGGAGCACCGGGCGCGGAATCAGGAACTGGCCGGGG TCCGCACCGGGCCTGAGTCGGTCCGGTAC-3 ' , and for FP4-3 ' , 5'-GGAG GAAGCGCGCCACCAGGAACTGGCC-3 ' .
The underlined sequences indicate the nucleotides that were changed from wild-type sequences .
A plasmid containing a mutation in the putative Ets site was made by first subcloning a construct harboring an Ets site mutation in 51 bp of 5'-flanking sequences and then cloning an EcoRI-Smel partial restriction fragment upstream .
Mutations in the potential AP-1 site were generated by PCRs with mutant primers .
Constructs containing downstream sequences were generated by subcloning six distinct Secl fragments into the pGL2 promoter plasmid that contains a simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) promoter 5 '' of the luciferase gene or four distinct BamHI fragments into a 3 ' site of p446 .
A 1.4-kb Nsil-EcoRI fragment from the c-fes genomic construct which contains 3'-flanking sequences was subcloned into both the pGL2 promoter and p446 .
Reference plasmids for transient transfections consisted of luciferase coding sequences with the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and growth hormone ( GH ) with the cytomegalovirus promoter .
All plasmids were verified by dideoxy-DNA sequencing .
Cell culture and transient-expression analysis .
Both U937 and K562 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , penicillin , streptomycin , and glutamine .
Cos and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing the same additives .
Approximately 24 h prior to electroporation , the cells were split 1:3 with fresh medium .
The following day , U937 and K562 cells were electroporated as described previously ( 22 ) .
Cos and HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectin reagent ( Gibco/BRL ) .
Duplicate transfections were performed by combining the cells , 100 pg of luciferase reporter plasmid , and 2 g of the GH reference plasmid , peDNA-GH , in electroporation cuvettes .
At the time of plating , all of the U937 cells were stimulated with 54 nM PMA to increase the transfection efficiency as reported previously ( 22 ) .
Cos cells were cotransfected with 16 ug of peDNA3 expression plasmid ( Invitrogen ) containing PU.1 or Elf-1 , 4 pg of test luciferase reporter plasmid , and 2 ag of the GH reference plasmid .
After 13 h ( for U937 and K562 cells ) or 48 h ( for Cos and HeLa cells ) of culture at 37°C , cells were harvested and assayed for protein content , secreted GH , and luciferase activity .
Luciferase assays were performed with equivalent amounts of protein obtained from all cell extracts .
GH activity was measured on transfected-cell medium supernatants by radioimmunoassay as specified by Nichols Institute .
As a control for transfection efficiency , plasmid expression was quantitated as relative light units normalized to nanograms of GH secreted .
All transfections were performed at least three times to ensure reproducibility .
Nuclear extracts and EMSAs .
Nuclear extracts of U937 cells were prepared as described previously ( 5 ) , assayed for protein content ( Bio-Rad ) , and used to identify protein binding sites in the 5 ' region of the c-fes gene between positions -446 and +71 relative to the primary transcriptional start site .
Because of its length , this fragment was digested with Eeg !
( which cuts at -151 ) , thus generating two probes containing 294 and 223 bp of DNA .
DNase I footprinting assays were performed essentially as described in reference 6 .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed by incubating 10 ag of nuclear extract ( 2 ) with 10,000 dpm of each radiolabeled probe as REGULATION OF c-fes BY A NOVEL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1677 described previously ( 14 ) .
Alternatively , radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes were incubated with in vitro-translated proteins prepared with T7-coupled reticulocyte lysates ( Promega ) .
Reactions were performed for 15 min at 4°C or 30 min at room temperature .
The following oligonucleotides were utilized : c-fes Sp1 ( -102 to -46 ) , 5'-age CCGCCCCGGGG-3 ' ; Spl .

The mutated PU.1 site in the PU.1 oligonucleotide ( -32 to -1 ) and the SV40 oligonucleotide are listed in Fig .
7 and 8 .
The sequences utilized to analyze the flanking site binding requirements were made in the context of the c-fes oligonucleotide PU.1/FP4-3 ' ( -32 to +14 ) and are as follows : mutation 1 ( mut1 ) , 5'-gettAAACCGCGGGAGGAGGAAGCGCGCCACCAGGAACTGGCCGG GGTCC C-3 ' ; mut2 , 5'-agcttAAACCCGGGAGGAGGAAGCGCGCCACGG GGAACTGGCCGGGGTCC-3 ' ; and mut3 , 5'-agcttAAACCGCGGGAGGAG GAAGCGCCCTAATTAAGGCTGGCCGGGGTCC-3 ' .

The lowercase letters indicate the sequences used for subcloning purposes .
The consensus AP-1 site is from the metallothionein promoter ( 25 ) .
The rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for human Spl , murine PU.1 , human pan-fos , and murine pan-jur were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. A second polyclonal antibody specific for full-length PU.1 was a gift of David Kabat .
A monoclonal antibody specific for Elf-1 was the generous gift of Jeff Leiden .
Supershift and/or blocking reactions were performed as described above for EMSAs .
RESULTS e-fes is transcribed in human myeloid cell lines .
In the human genome the 3 ' end of fur , a gene encoding a transmem-brane protein with receptor-like features , is located approximately 1 kb upstream of the first exon of c-fes ( 27 ) .
Of note , fur and c-fes are expressed in distinct tissues .
The 13-kb human c-fes genomic fragment , which displays high levels of tissue-specific expression in transgenic mice , contains 446 bp of 5'-flanking sequences and 1.4 kb of 3'-flanking sequences .
The ¢-fes locus includes 19 exons , one DNase I-hypersensitive site located 5 ' of the first exon , and two sites located between exons 3 and 4 ( Fig .
1A ) ( 15 ) .
Previous studies of p92 '' indicated that it is preferentially expressed in myeloid cells in adults .
To confirm and extend these results , we analyzed the relative levels of c-fes expression in various human cell lines by RNase protection analyses ( Fig .
1B ) .
RNA was isolated from four myeloid cell lines ( K562 , U937 , HL60 , and THP-1 ) , an epithelial carcinoma cell line ( HeLa ) , and a T-cell line ( Jurkat ) .
As shown in Fig .
1B , c-fes mRNA was detected in U937 , HL60 , and THP-1 cells but was not detectable in either the T cells or epithelial cells .
K562 cells were established from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia and exhibit both erythrocytic and early monocytic characteristics ( 18 ) .
Experiments involving gene transfer into K562 cells with the 13-kb c-fes human genomic clone resulted in high levels of c-fes mRNA and kinase activity and subsequent myeloid differentiation ( 40 ) .
We did not detect any endogenous c-fes mRNA in K562 cells by RNase protection assays ( Fig .
1B ) but could detect low levels by reverse transcription-PCR ( data not shown ) .
c-fes mRNA and protein levels have also been reported to increase as monocytes and granulocytes mature .
Treatment of U937 cells with phorbol esters induces terminal monocytic differentiation .
Therefore , we stimulated U937 cells with PMA in order to test the hypothesis that this would induce c-fes transcription .
However , PMA treatment for 16 h decreased mRNA levels in U937 cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
The lower panel in Fig .
1B , showing hybridiza-tion to a B-actin probe , demonstrates that similar amounts of RNA were analyzed in each sample .
Functional domains within the c-fes gene .
Transient transfections into myeloid cells by electroporation were conducted to identify cis-acting sites within the 13-kb c-fes locus .
Initially , we transfected a luciferase reporter plasmid containing bases 1678 HEYDEMANN ET AL .

-446 to +71 of c-fes into U937 cells .
This plasmid ( called p446 ) increased luciferase activity 125,000 times over that of the plasmid pGL2-basic negative control , which is expressed at very low levels in U937 cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
The level of activity obtained with the c-fes p446 reporter plasmid was 25 % of that obtained with the RSV-luciferase positive control plasmid ( Fig .
2A ) .
The human c-fes promoter contains a CpG island and no TATA element ; multiple transcription start sites have been determined by primer extension analysis of U937 and HL60 mRNA ( 1 ) .
c-fes transcripts initiate at multiple sites within exon 1 , and the primary site corresponds to the first nucleotide of published cDNA sequences ( 1 ) .
One additional cap site is located at the 5 ' border of exon 2 .
To determine if the first intron serves as a second promoter , we linked DNA sequences from this region to luciferase coding sequences and transfected this construct into U937 cells .
In contrast to the high levels of expression noted for the sequences 5 ' to exon 1 , sequences within the first intron contain no transcriptional activity ( data not shown ) .
To determine if other positive , cis-acting elements for transient c-fes expression exist within the 13-kb human genomic locus ( in particular the third intron , where two DNase I-hypersensitive sites are located ) , various Secl and BamHI DNA fragments spanning the locus were cloned into a pGL2 plasmid containing the SV40 promoter ( pGL2 promoter ) or p446 ( the c-fes promoter ) .
The 1.4-kb 3 ' region up to the EcoRI site indicated in Fig .
1A elevated transient expression threefold compared with either the pGL2 promoter or p446 ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , our results indicate that the strongest positive , cis-acting DNA elements identified by transient-transfection analyses lie within the first 446 bp 5 ' of the primary mRNA cap site .
Although a weak 3 ' enhancer element was identified by our experiments , we focused on the 446-bp 5 ' -flanking region .
To further localize cis-acting elements in the 446-bp c-fes promoter , deletion analyses were performed .
A schematic rep resentation of the luciferase constructs tested by transfection is shown in Fig .
2B .
DNA sequences located between nucleotides -446 and -366 were largely dispensable for transient expression , as luciferase activity in U937 cells dropped only 10 % if these nucleotides were removed from the 5 ' end .
Plasmid p251 ( containing 251 bp of 5 ' sequences ) retained 77 % of promoter activity compared with p446 .
However , when the region between -251 and -151 was deleted , expression was reduced to 38 % .
Finally , deletion of bp -99 to -51 essentially decreased activity to less than 1 % of that observed with p446 ( Fig .
2B ) .
We conclude that two important functional domains of the c-fes promoter reside within nucleotides extending from -251 to -151 and from -99 to -51 upstream of the primary site of transcription initiation .
The ¢-fes genomic locus contains a myeloid-cell-specific promoter .
The 13-kb human c-fes transgene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in transgenic mice .
To determine if the 446-bp c-fes 5 promoter was also myeloid cell specific , the luciferase reporter plasmid , p446 , was transiently transfected into myeloid and nonmyeloid cells .
As shown in Fig .
3A , The promoterless plasmid pGL2 produced low levels of luciferase activity in all four cell lines tested .
p446 was expressed at high levels in two myeloid cell lines ( K562 and U937 ) and was at least 100 times more active than in the nonmyeloid cells ( Cos and HeLa ) .
Furthermore , the 446-bp 5'-flanking region elevated luciferase activity 186-fold over pGL2 in K562 cells and 115,000-fold over pGL2 in U937 cells .
These results differ significantly from the 3-fold stimulation observed in Cos cells ( p446 versus pGL2 ) and the 1.3-fold stimulation seen in HeLa cells ( Fig .
3A ) .
In addition , p446 was not active in the Jurkat T-cell line ( data not shown ) .
It is important to note that reference GH levels for K562 , Cos , and HeLa cells were identical and that U937 cells gave values two- to threefold lower .
These results demonstrate that the 5 ' sequences upstream of the c-fes transcription initiation site contain a promoter that is active in a myeloid-cell-specific fashion .
Of note , we predicted that the Vou .

RSV , Rous sarcoma virus .
c-fes promoter would be active in K562 cells even though they express low levels of the endogenous gene because the 13-kb c-fes transgene is active when introduced into this cell line .
As stated previously , stable K562 transformants containing the transgene synthesize high levels of c-fes mRNA and protein and exhibit high levels of kinase activity ( 40 ) .
As shown in the previous section , a plasmid containing 151 bp of 5 ' c-fes sequences linked to luciferase was less active in U937 cells than one containing 446 bp but still resulted in 40,000-fold-higher activity than pGL2 .
To learn if the 151-bp region is regulated in a myeloid-cell-specific pattern , p151 was transiently transfected into U937 , K562 , Cos , and 3T3 cells .
As shown in Fig .
3B , p151 generated luciferase activity at levels 20- to 30-fold higher in K562 and U937 cells than in 3T3 and Cos cells and thereby retained tissue-specific expression .
Sp1 interacts with the c-fes promoter .
To identify nuclear protein binding sites within the 446-bp c-fes promoter , DNase I footprinting analyses were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from U937 cells .
Four nuclear protein binding sites were identified in these experiments , and the data are summarized in Fig .
4 .
The first footprint ( FP1 ) extends from bp -408 to -386 and does not contain a previously described consensus motif .
The second nuclear protein binding site ( FP2 ) extends from bp -293 to -254 and includes a consensus nuclear pro tein binding site for the transcription factor Spl ( -293 to -285 ) .
Interestingly , neither of these two nuclear protein binding sites was absolutely required for the in vitro activity of the c-fes promoter ( i.e. , p251 retained 77 % of full promoter activity ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
The third footprint ( FP3 ) includes nucleotides -76 to -65 and contains one DNase I-hypersensitive site .
This region , which is footprinted weakly compared with the other footprints , contains three potential nuclear protein binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Spl .
Sp1 sites have been identified in several other transcriptional regulatory elements that are present in myeloid-cell-specific genes , including CD11b ( 21 ) .
The fourth nuclear protein binding site ( FP4 ) extends from -34 to +1 on the antisense strand and from -34 to +3 on the sense strand and is also surrounded by several hypersensitive sites .
This region contains a consensus Ets family member binding site ( -21 to =-11 ) and a nonconsensus AP-1 binding site ( -10 to -3 ) .
Comparison of this sequence with other previously described Ets binding sites suggests that this motif can bind to either or both of the transcription factors Elf-1 and PU.1 but not to Ets-1 ( 35 , 36 ) .
In addition , as is the case for multiple other Ets binding sites ( 9 , 34 , 37 ) , this region is immediately adjacent to a nonconsensus AP-1 family member nuclear protein binding site ( 5'-TGATTCC-3 ' , nucleotides -10 to -3 on the opposite strand ) .

K562 , U937 , Cos , and HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase construct under the control of the c-fes promoter .
K562 and U937 cells were transfected for 13 h and Cos and HeLa cells were transfected for 48 h. Each construct was transfected 3 to 10 times with different preparations of plasmid DNA , and the data are averages of these experiments .
The reference plasmid , pCMV-GH , produced similar levels of GH in all cell lines transfected .
( B ) Functional analysis of the 151-bp 5 ' region in K562 , U937 , Cos , and 3T3 cells .
As shown by computer search analyses , there are three putative Spl binding sites in the core c-fes promoter .
To determine if Spl interacts with the promoter , EMSAs were conducted with an oligonucleotide probe that includes these three putative Spl binding sites and extends from bp -93 to -46 ( Fig .
5 ) .
The first three lanes in Fig .
5A exhibit results obtained with nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa , U937 , and K562 cells respectively .
As expected , all three cell lines contained DNA binding activities for the ubiquitous Sp1 protein when incubated with this oligonucleotide probe .
To test the specific-ity of binding , the assays that are shown in lanes 4 through 6 of Fig .
5 also contained various cold competitor DNAs .
A 100-fold molar excess of the identical c-fes oligonucleotide effectively inhibited DNA binding ( Fig .
5 , lane 4 ) .
An unrelated oligonucleotide that includes a consensus Spl site ( see Materials and Methods ) also competed for this DNA-protein complex ( Fig .
5 , lane 5 ) .
However , another unrelated oligonucleotide ( PU.1 ) corresponding to 32 bp of the c-fes promoter ( -32 to =1 ) that includes a PU.1/Elf-1 binding site did not compete for this binding activity ( Fig .
5 , lane 6 ) .
Addition of an antibody against Sp1 caused a supershift of the DNA-protein complex in K562 cells ( Fig .
5B , lane 2 ) .
These results strongly suggest that transcription factor Sp1 binds in vitro to at least -446 Epi ( IEAATTCCGTGAGGTGGGGAGGGCTGGGACCAGGGTTC -366 [ Erescoreerecoraceacrecececomrcecorcacraccescesacaccerecserrece Sp1 FP2 TGGGCCCAGCATCTGCCTG @ eeCccTceccr WM -251 o [ pcompecceeremreccsceecooreccaseccomreccecomrececsececesececerc ~151 mrecomescccamrommmeccesceccorcopceommecemmccoreecceTeccecce -99 comaeacecreceecccaccececaccaceeccecreccacecerceceaccercecace Sp1 FP3 Spi Sp1 ' 5.1 comecoscocpeccompeccomrcacaseeccececcecseccrecsccaacfearacce ] Fp4 1 a a ~PUAZEIM - paz FIG .

REGULATION OF c-fes BY A NOVEL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1681 one of the three consensus Sp1 sites in this portion of the c-fes promoter .
The PU.1/Elf-1 and FP4-3 ' sites are required for c-fes promoter activity in myeloid cells .
As shown in Fig .
2B , a construct containing 51 bp of 5 ' c-fes sequences was inactive in transient assays .
However , a footprinted region ( FP4 , from -34 to +3 ) was detected by DNase I protection analyses ( Fig .
4 ) .
We therefore tested specific mutations in this footprinted region in the context of the entire 446-bp promoter by transient transfections .
Figure 6A shows that promoter activity in U937 cells is sharply reduced ( by approximately 90 % ) if the PU.1/Elf-1 DNA binding site is changed from 5'-GAGGAGGAAGCG C-3 ' to 5-GAGCACCGGGCGC-3 ' , a mutation that renders it incapable of binding PU.1 or Elf-1 ( see Fig .
7A ) .
In addition , a mutation in the flanking site FP4-3 ' ( which does not affect PU.1 DNA binding activity ) from 5-TGATTCC-3 ' to TGGC-3 ' resulted in an 80 % decrease in expression compared with the wild-type construct ( Fig .
6B ) .
Taken together , these data strongly suggest that important regulators for c-fes expression include Sp1 and PU.1 or Elf-1 .
In addition , either AP-1 or another DNA-binding protein ( s ) binding to FP4-3 ' also plays a role in the expression of c-fes in myeloid cells .
PU.1 and Elf-1 bind to the Ets site in the c-fes promoter , but AP-1 family members do not bind to FP4-3 ' .
DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated the existence of a nuclear protein binding site within the c-fes promoter that could potentially bind both Ets and AP-1 family members .

Investigation of protein binding to the PU.1/Elf-1 and FP4-3 ' sites .

Dashed arrow , Elf-1 supershift .
AAGC-3 ' at position -21 upstream of the transcription start site .
Myeloid cells express the Ets family members Ets-1 , Elf-1 , and PU.1 ( 2b , 16 ) .
Published DNA binding site specificities indicate that the c-fes promoter contains a consensus Elf-1 and/or PU.1 site : Ets-1 selectively binds G-3 ' , while both Elf-1 and PU.1 bind the 5'-GAGGAGGAA GC-3 ' sequence ( 35 , 36 ) .
To determine if myeloid-cell nuclear extracts contain Ets binding activities that recognize this region of the c-fes promoter , EMSAs were performed .
As shown in Fig .
7A , a radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to bp -32 to -1 forms multiple nuclear protein complexes with extracts prepared from U937 cells .
Three complexes evince specific interactions with the oligonucleotide probe because a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competes for these DNA binding activities ( Fig .
7A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The fourth complex , is thought to be nonspecific , as an oligonucleotide with a mutation in the Ets site also competed for binding ( Fig .
7A , lane 3 ) , as did a variety of oligonucleotides with dissimilar sequences ( data not shown ) .
We have determined that the most slowly migrating complex contains Elf-1 , as it comigrates with in vitro-translated Elf-1 protein ( Fig .
7A , lane 5 ) and is supershifted with a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes Elf-1 and not other Ets family members ( Fig .
7A , lane 8 ) .
In addition , a more rapidly migrating complex represents PU.1 binding to the Ets site , as it comigrates with in vitro-translated PU.1 ( Fig .
7A , lane 4 ) and is blocked by the addition of anti-PU.1 antibody ( Fig .
7A , lane 7 ) .
Both antibodies used in these experiments were tested with pure Elf-1 and PU.1 proteins ( see Fig .
8 ; also , data not shown ) .
The fastest-migrating complex may represent a proteolytic product of PU.1 that retains DNA binding activity .
However , it is not possible to unequivocally identify this protein , as it is not recognized by the antibody to PU.1 .
To determine if AP-1 family members bind to the nonconsensus site at -10 to -3 , a longer oligonucleotide which extended from -32 to +14 ( -32/+14 ) and included FP4-3 ' was utilized .
By using this oligonucleotide and unstimulated U937 nuclear extracts , six nuclear protein complexes were detected ( Fig .
7B ) .
The upper two bands in Fig .
7B migrate very closely together and are resolved best in lane 3 .
Band three corresponds to an Elf-1 complex because it can be supershifted with an Elf-1-specific antibody ( Fig .
7B , lane 9 ) .
Similarly , bands five and six are identified as PU.1 by their ablation with the anti-PU.1 antibody , which now detects both intact and truncated PU.1 ( Fig .
7B , lane 8 ) .
To identify the proteolytic product of PU.1 , binding reactions were modified and tested with antibodies that recognize the amino terminus ( Santa Cruz ) and full-length protein ( from David Kabat , Oregon Health Sciences University ) .
Bands five and six are also inhibited by competition with the PU.1 oligonucleotide ( -32 to -1 ) ( Fig .
7B , lane 3 ) .
Therefore , in an investigation of the nonconsensus AP-1 site , bands one , two , and four were considered .
Band two Vou .
16 , 1996 was not inhibited by cold oligonucleotide -32/+14 and was therefore thought to be nonspecific ( Fig .
7B , lane 2 ) .
Neither band one nor band four was supershifted or reduced by anti-pan-fos or anti-pan-jun antibodies ( Fig .
7B , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
However , both of these antibodies affected specific AP-1-shifted bands detected in U937 cells treated with PMA by using a consensus metallothionein AP-1 probe ( data not shown ) .
Bands one and four were also not inhibited upon addition of a cold competitor consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide from the metallothionein promoter ( Fig .
7B , lane 5 ) .
We concluded that the diffuse band four corresponds to the nonspecific band indicated in Fig .
7A and that band one corresponds to a protein binding FP4-3 ' ( see below ) .
We also concluded that AP-1 does not regulate c-fes .
PU.1 binds to the c-fes promoter at two sites , -21 to -14 and -8 to +3 .
A recent report ( 26 ) claims that in vitro-translated PU.1 binds to the sequence 5-AATCAGGAACT-3 ' located at nucleotides -8 to +3 of the c-fes promoter .
The oligonucleotide -32/+14 was used in EMSAs with in vitro-translated PU.1 .
As shown in Fig .
8 , PU.1 binds to the PU.1/ FPA4-3 ' ( -32/+14 ) oligonucleotide ( lane 1 ) and is specifically inhibited by excess cold competitor ( lane 2 ) .
Importantly , the PU.1 oligonucleotide ( -32 to -1 ) also competes for binding ( Fig .
8 , lane 3 ) , while a mutation at the Ets site at -21 no longer competes ( Fig .
8 , lane 4 ) .
This demonstrates that the -32/-1 oligonucleotide does not include the complete PU.1 site from -8 to +3 .
Mutations 1 , 2 , and 3 of the flanking site FPA4-3 ' ( -8 to +3 ) competed efficiently in our assays ( Fig .
8 , lanes 8 to 10 ) , showing that the -21 site is intact .
EMSAs with the -11/+5 oligonucleotide also demonstrated binding of PU.1 in U937 nuclear extracts ( see Fig .
10A , lane 1 ) .
Because both the -32/-1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
7A ) and the -11/+5 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
10A ) bind efficiently , we conclude that PU.1 binds to the Ets site at -21 and to the site at -8 .
The -32/+14 oligonucleotide harbors two binding sites for PU.1 in addition to a site for the FP4-3 ' activity .
Transactivation of the myeloid-cell-specific c-fes promoter by PU.1 .
Given the specific binding of both Elf-1 and PU.1 to the c-fes promoter , we performed a series of transient-cotransfection experiments with both of these proteins in the nonmyeloid Cos cell line , which lacks endogenous Elf-1 or PU.1 activity .
The promoterless luciferase expression vector pGL2 , a minimal c-fes promoter construct ( p51 ) , and a c-fes promoter construct containing a mutation in the Ets site ( pS1im ) were introduced into Cos cells with expression plasmids that produce high levels of Elf-1 or PU.1 driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter .
As shown in Fig .
9 , cotransfection with PU.1 resulted in a reproducible fivefold stimulation of the c-fes promoter , and this stimulation was dependent on having the -21 Ets binding site intact .
Similar results were obtained in experiments carried out with 3T3 cells ( data not shown ) .
Importantly , PU.1 transactivated constructs containing the full promoter ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , Elf-1 failed to transactivate the c-fes promoter in either cell line .
On the basis of these results , we conclude that PU.1 is the most likely member of the Ets family of DNA-binding proteins to regulate c-fes gene expression .
Furthermore , when the Ets site at position -21 is mutated , PU.1 fails to transactivate the c-fes promoter even though the PU.1 binding site at -8 is intact .
A novel factor binds to the FP4-3 ' site in the c-fes promoter .
Our results clearly demonstrate that PU.1 binds specifically to the Ets site at nucleotide -21 of the c-fes promoter and that transactivation depends on the integrity of the -21 site .
We performed EMSAs to determine what factor ( s ) binds to FP4-3 ' ( -8 to +3 ) , having determined that AP-1 does not bind to FPA4-3 ' ( Fig .
7B ) .

This band is inhibited by the wild-type oligonucleotide ( Fig .

Importantly , a mutation in the FP4-3 ' site that affects the sequence 5-GAATCAGGAACT-3 ' ( mut1 ) interrupts binding and decreases ¢-fes expression in transient-transfection assays ( Fig .

This mutation still allows PU.1 to bind to the -8 site .
Lanes 6 , 7 , and 10 of Fig .
10A confirm that this FP4-3'-protein complex does not contain PU.1 .
Neither a consensus PU.1 oligonucleotide from SV40 nor a PU.1 antibody disrupts the FP4-3 ' complex .
However , the SV40 PU.1 oligonucleotide specifically inhibits the PU.1 complex ( the fastest two bands in Fig .

Furthermore , FP4-3 ' is not affected by Spl or AP-1 oligonucleotides or by antibodies to PU.1 , Myb , Elf-1 , Fos , or Jun ( Fig .

To determine the tissue distribution of the FP4-3 ' -binding factor , EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts from myeloid ( U937 , THP-1 , HL60 , K562 , and KG1 ) and nonmyeloid ( HepG2 , Jurkat , Clone 13 , and HeLa ) cell lines ( Fig .
10B ) .
The FP4-3'-specific complex was present only in the nuclear extracts from the myeloid cell line , with the exception of HepG2 liver cells , which also contain the activity .
The slowly migrating complex was not detected in Jurkat T-cell , Clone 13 B-cell , or HeLa epithelial-cell nuclear extracts .
We conclude that the FP4-3 ' complex is largely restricted to myeloid cells .
DISCUSSION The c-fes tyrosine kinase appears to be highly restricted in its pattern of expression in adult mammals .
Although it is expressed in other tissues in murine and human embryos , after birth it is detected only in cells of the myeloid lineage ( mono-cytes and neutrophils and their precursors ) and in vascular endothelial cells .
Several lines of evidence strongly implicate the c-fes protein as being crucial for monocytic and neutrophilic development : increased levels of kinase activity correlate with the maturation of monocytes and neutrophils ( 31 , 38 ) , and inhibition of c-fes mRNA translation into protein leads to apoptotic death during neutrophilic differentiation ( 8 , 20 ) .

16 , 1996 markably , important cis-acting DNA elements that ensure high levels of c-fes transcription in myeloid cells must reside within a relatively short fragment of DNA : a 13-kb human transgene is expressed in the appropriate tissues at very high levels .
The reasons for our interest in the c-fes gene are many .
We want to learn which proteins are responsible for tightly controlling c-fes mRNA production .
If c-fes kinase levels are critical for myeloid development , it stands to reason that the factors controlling its transcription will also be important in development .
Also , a potent promoter for the myeloid lineage will be a useful tool for the generation of transgenic mice that inappropriately express gene products in these lineages .
Given the extremely high levels of expression reported for a 13-kb human genomic fragment upon introduction into transgenic mice , we reasoned that it should be relatively important to identify cis-acting sites within this short region of genomic DNA .
We have demonstrated that promoter-proximal sequences from -151 to +71 are sufficient to direct myeloid-cell-specific expression .
The elements that appear to be the most important for activity during electroporation into U937 cells are located at nucleotides -99 to -51 and -34 to +3 .
We have shown that the -99 region selectively binds the transcription factor Spl .
The footprinted site at -34 includes a consensus site for Ets family members PU.1 and/or Elf-1 as opposed to Ets-1 .
Although both PU.1 and Elf-1 recognize this site in in vitro binding reactions , PU.1 alone can transactivate the c-fes promoter in nonmyeloid cell lines ( Cos and 3T 3 cells ) , suggesting that PU.1 is the critical regulator of the c-fes promoter .
Furthermore , macrophages that lack Elf-1 ( because of gene tar-geting ) still express normal levels of c-fes ( 2a ) .
We have previously shown that mice deficient in PU.1 do not produce mature macrophages and neutrophils ( 31 ) .
The blockage of macrophage and neutrophil development is coincident with c-fes expression in these lineages .
We have isolated early myeloid cells lacking PU.1 and demonstrated a deficiency in c-fes expression ( Z21a ) .
Therefore , our genetic data are consistent with the transactivation results showing that PU.1 is the Ets family member that regulates c-fes .
PU.1 has been proposed as a regulator of other myeloid-cell-specific genes , including CD11b ( 23 ) , the M-CSF receptor ( 41 ) , and the macrophage scavenger receptor ( 37 ) .
Interestingly , as is the case for CD11b and the M-CSF receptor , PU.1 binds to a site just 5 ' of the primary transcriptional start site in the c-fes promoter , which also lacks a consensus TATA box .
Given the finding that PU.1 binds to TATA-binding protein in vitro ( 12 ) , it is tempting to speculate that PU.1 may function to recruit TFIID and then the other components of the basal transcriptional machinery to all three of these promoters .
The footprinted promoter-proximal region from -34 to +3 also includes a weak consensus site for AP-1 family members that is directly adjacent to the Ets site .
Many Ets family transcription factors interact with another protein when binding to DNA ( 4 , 9 , 34 ) .
Combinatorial interactions between Ets-2 and AP-1 for the scavenger receptor promoter ( 37 ) and between Elf-1 and AP-1 for the GM-CSF promoter ( 34 ) have been described .
PU.1 has been demonstrated to form a complex with the B-cell factor NF-EMS to activate the immunoglobulin k and \ 3 ' enhancers ( 24 ) .
However , EMSAs performed with the PU.1 site in the c-fes promoter failed to detect PU.1 in a stable complex with another protein .
A distinct assay for protein-DNA interactions ( i.e. , DNase I footprinting ) clearly showed that both the PU.1 and FP4-3 ' sites bound nuclear proteins in U937 cells .
Furthermore , both sites are functionally important for c-fes promoter activity in U937 cells .
It seems possible that a PU.1/FP4-3'-protein interaction , while important to the regulation of c-fes expression , may not be suffi- REGULATION OF c-fes BY A NOVEL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1685 ciently stable in a gel assay for detection .
It is clear that the FP4-3 ' site ( 5'-GAATCAGGAACT-3 ' ) does not bind either of the other myeloid transcription factors c-myb ( 5'-CAAC GG-3 ' ) and CEBP/a « ( 5'-GTGGAAAG-3 ' ) , as their consensus sites are distinct from FP4-3 ' ( 21 ) and FP4-3 ' does not bind antibodies specific for myb .
While this work was in progress , Ray-Gallet et al .
reported that PU.1 binds to the c-fes promoter ( 26 ) .
However , their analyses suggested that PU.1 binds to a site located at -8 to +3 of the promoter .
The oligonucleotide used for EMSAs in that report did not include the PU.1 site that we have identified and would therefore fail to detect PU.1 binding at bp -21 of the c-fes promoter .
The -8 site overlaps the FP4-3 ' site , which is located at -9 to +3 and for which we have demonstrated specific binding of a novel factor .
Through our mutational analysis , we have identified a slowly migrating complex corresponding to a protein-DNA interaction at FP4-3 ' which is critical for promoter function ( Fig .
10B ) .
This band is not supershifted or reduced by anti-PU.1 or by anti-Elf-1 .
We conclude that FP4 includes two binding sites for PU.1 in addition to FP4-3 ' .
It is interesting that the Sp1 , PU.1 , and FP4-3 ' sites have been conserved in the chicken , feline , and human ¢c-fes promoters .
Finally , the FP4-3 ' complex appears to contain a DNA binding activity restricted in its expression to myeloid cells .
It will be of interest to identify the factor ( s ) binding to FPA4-3 ' that regulates c-fes in myeloid cells .
Such a factor ( s ) could be useful for the further analysis of myeloid-cell-specific expression .
