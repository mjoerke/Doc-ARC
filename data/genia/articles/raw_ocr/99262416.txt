Here we document that overexpression of Id3 , in progenitors that have initiated TCR gene rearrangements ( pre-T cells ) , inhibits development into TCRa & RB but not into TCRy8 T cells .
Furthermore , Id3 impedes expression of recombination activating genes and downregulates pre-TG mRNA .
These observations suggest possible mechanisms by which Id3 overexpression can differentially affect development of pre-T cells into TCRB and 46 cells .
We also observed that cell surface CD4-CDS8-CD3~ cells with rearranged TCR genes developed from 1Id3-transduced but not from control-transduced pre- T cells in an FTOC .
These cells had properties of both natural killer ( NK ) and pre-T cells .
These findings suggest that bHLH factors are required to control T cell development after the T/NK developmental checkpoint .
Keywords : basic helix-loop-helix protein/NK cell/T cells/thymus/transcription Introduction During the period of T cell differentiation in the thymus , there is a continuous influx of blood-borne hematopoietic progenitors ( Scollay et al. , 1986 ; Donskoy and Goldschneider , 1992 ) .
While the exact identity of the thymic immigrants has yet to be determined , studies on the most primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells in both human and mouse thymus strongly suggest that these cells are not committed to the T cell lineage ( Spits et al. , 1995 ; Shortman and Wu , 1996 ; Blom et al. , 1998 ) .
The earliest hematopoietic progenitor cells in the human thymus express high levels of CD34 , lack CD1a ( Figure 1 ) and have the capacity to develop into natural killer ( NK ) cells © European Molecular Biology Organization and dendritic cells ( Sanchez et al. , 1994 ; Marquez et al. , 1995 ; Res et al. , 1996 ) .
CD1a-CD34* cells have their y genes in the germline configuration but contain immature ( D-D and D-J ) T cell receptor 8 ( TCR8 ) gene rearrangements ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
Upregulation of CD1a on CD34 * cells is correlated with induction of T cell commitment as mature TCRS rearrangements are present and TCRy and TCRB rearrangements commence at the CD1atCD34+* stage ( Ramiro et al. , 1996 ; Blom et al. , 1997 , 1999 ) .
These cells develop into CD3-CD4*CD8~ , denoted CD4 immature single positive ( ISP ) , cells ( Galy et al. , 1993 ; Kraft et al. , 1993 ) .
CD4 ISP cells are fully committed to the T cell lineage as they are unable to differentiate into cells other than T cells .
The great majority if not all of the CD4 ISP cells contain mature TCR8 rearrangements , and ~35 % of the TCRy alleles are rearranged in these cells .
However , the majority of the TCRRB alleles ( 85 % ) of the CD4 ISP cells are still in the germlike configuration ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
The hierarchy in TCR gene rearrangements found by Blom et al .
is consistent with a recent analysis of in- and out-of-frame and 8 rearrangements , indicating that in most humans the TCR8 locus rearranges before B ( Margolis et al. , 1997 ) .
However , the latter study also suggested that in some individuals the TCRS locus rearranges concurrently with TCRB .
The sequence of various developmental cellular stages and the hierarchy of TCR gene rearrangements during T cell development in man and mice are similar ( Shortman and Wu , 1996 ; Capone et al. , 1998 ; Spits et al. , 1998 ) .
When developing into T cells , the progenitor cells should pass a number of clearly defined checkpoints ( Godfrey and Zlotnik , 1993 ; Shortman and Wu , 1996 ; Blom et al. , 1998 ) .
The first one is the T/NK checkpoint when progenitor cells commit to the T cell lineage .
This should occur at or around the transition of CD1a CD34* into CD1atCD34¢* cells .
A second checkpoint is when the pre-T cell chooses to become either a TCR « RB or a TCRY8 cell ; the cellular stage where this happens in the human thymus has yet to be determined .
The mechanisms of the T/NK and TCR « B/yd lineage choices are as yet poorly understood .
Recent studies in mouse and human systems have provided evidence that basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors are involved in induction of commitment to the T cell lineage at the T/NK checkpoint ( Bain et al. , 1997a ; Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
bHLH factors are well characterized and have been shown to be important regulators of lineage determination and cell type specification in many organisms ( Murre et al. , 1994 ) .
These proteins are characterized by two highly conserved bipartite domains .
An HLH domain , mainly consisting of hydrophobic residues , permits hetero- or homodimerization of these proteins .
A motif of basic residues mediates binding of these complexes to a con 2793 B.Blom et al .

A model of early developmental stages of T cell development in the human thymus .
sensus E-box ( CANNTG ) sequence present in promoters or enhancers of target genes ( Church et a/. , 1985 ; Ephrussi et al. , 1985 ) .
Two members of the bHLH family , E12 and E47 , encoded by the E2A gene ( Murre et al. , 1989 ) are essential for B cell development but are also involved in T cell development ( Bain et a/. , 1994 , 1997a , b ; Zhuang et al. , 1994 ) .
The thymuses of E2A-deficient mice have a low cellularity with a size of ~20 % compared with their wild-type littermates .
T cell differentiation is partially blocked at an early stage of development .
Mice deficient for another bHLH factor , HEB , exhibit , besides a profound B cell defect , a partial T cell developmental block ( Zhuang et al. , 1996 ) .
Concordant with these observations in the mouse , we have documented that inhibition of bHLH factors in human T cell precursors blocks development of these cells into T cells in an in vitro fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) ( Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
In that study , we took advantage of the finding that transcriptional activity of bHLH factors is regulated by a structurally related group of proteins , generally referred to as inhibitors of DNA binding or Id proteins .
This subfamily consists of four members ( Id1-Id4 ) that have varying tissue distributions ( Christy et a/. , 1991 ; Sun et al. , 1991 ; Riechmann et al. , 1994 ) .
Id proteins possess the protein dimerization HLH domain , resulting in an ability to heterodimerize with the bHLH proteins , but as they lack the basic motif , they can not bind DNA .
Id proteins block the transcriptional activity of the bHLH proteins by sequestering these factors ( Benezra et al. , 1990 ) .
We found that exogenous expression of one of the Id proteins , Id3 , following retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in human CD34* fetal liver and thymocyte populations , inhibits T cell development in an FTOC exactly at the T/NK branch point ( Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
Most interestingly , NK cell development was promoted by enforced expression of Id3 , suggesting that sequestration of bHLH factors results in a shift in cell fate from T to NK lineage cells .
As Id3 interacts with EZA and HEB proteins , preventing DNA binding and transcriptional activation by these proteins ( Loveys et al. , 1996 ) , our findings have established an important role of bHLH factors in T cell development .
The transcriptional control mechanisms that dictate the « B/y5 lineage decision have not yet been elucidated .
However , some of the factors that contribute to the divergence of « B/y8 lineage have been resolved using the mouse system .
The occurrence of productive rearrangements at the y and 8 loci ( Kang et al. , 1995 ; Livak et al. , 1995 ) is an important factor , but also external signals provided through Notch1 ( Washburn et al. , 1997 ) and the pre-TCR ( Aifantis et al. , 1998 ) have been implicated .
2794 Here we provide evidence that bHLH factors , besides their role in the T/NK lineage determination , differentially affect TCRa @ B/y8 lineage development in an FTOC beyond the T/NK checkpoint .
We took advantage of a retroviral system that allows introduction of genes into cells at different stages of development to express Id3 in CD1a*CD34* and CD4 ISP pre-T cells .
It was observed that development of the transduced cells into TCRaR cells was strongly blocked .
In contrast , development of these cells to TCRYy8 T cells was not inhibited .
Strikingly , Id3-transduced but not control-transduced CD4 ISP cells have the capacity to develop into CD3~ cells that lost CD1a and CD4 expression but retained rearranged TCR genes .
These observations indicate that continued activities of bHLH factors are required to control development of TCRaRB cells beyond the T/NK checkpoint .
Results Effect of constitutive Id3 expression on development of CD1a* CD34* thymocytes in an FTOC We observed previously that overexpression of Id3 in CD1a-CD34* cells results in inhibition of differentiation of these cells into CD1at* cells and stimulation of NK development ( Heemskerk ef al. , 1997 ) .
Moreover , Id3 prevented initiation of TCRB gene rearrangements in CD1a-CD34+* thymocytes cultured in interleukin ( IL ) -7 .
Our results indicated that sequestering of bHLH factors by Id3 inhibits transition of CD1a~ into CD1a* progenitor cells .
As the NK precursor cell activity is strongly reduced in CD1atCD34+* thymocytes ( Spits et al. , 1998 ) and TCRy and B gene rearrangements are initiated upon upregulation of CD1la ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) , it was of interest to determine whether bHLH factors are necessary after acquisition of CD1la .
We sorted thymocytes and transduced them with Id3-internal ribo-some entry site ( IRES ) -green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) .
The cells were cultured in an FTOC for 3 weeks .
In a representative experiment , 1.6 X 10° cells were recovered , of which 3 % expressed high levels of the GFP marker , from five lobes which initially were seeded with 40 000 cells/lobe ( 8-fold expansion ) .
The phenotypic analysis of these cells is shown in Figure 2 .
The proportions of double positive ( DP ) cells which developed from the Id3-transduced CD1atCD34+* thymocytes were dramatically lower than observed for untransduced cells ( Figure 2 ; 3 versus 88 % ) .
Additionally , significant fewer TCRafB* T cells were present in the Id3-transduced cell sample ( 3 versus 64 % ) .
However , similar percentages of TCRYy8* T cells were recovered from the transduced and untransduced populations ( 1.1 versus 0.7 % ) .
Thus , the ratio TCRoRB to TCRYy8 was dramatically affected by Id3 overexpression ( 3 versus 90 ) .
Surprisingly , the majority of Id3~ GFP*+*CD1atCD34+* cells had lost CD1a after FTOC , although all cells expressed CD5 .
In contrast , virtually all untransduced cells remained positive for CD1a and CDS .
Though control-transduced CD1atCD34+* thymocytes were unable to develop into NK cells , CD3-~CD56* NK cells did develop from the Id3-transduced cells ( 7.6 % of the Id3-transduced cells versus 0 % of the untransduced cells ) .

inhibition of B but not of y5 T cell development .
Moreover , incubation of Id3-transduced cells in an FTOC resulted in downregulation of CD1a and led to development of CD56 * cells .
Overexpression of Id3 in CD4 ISP thymocytes blocks development of TCRafB® but not T cells in an FTOC The results presented in Figure 2 indicate that development from CD1latCD34¢* cells is strongly inhibited while development of TCRY6 cells is much less affected .
The stage that follows the CD1atCD34* stage expresses CD4 but lacks CD8 ( Figure 1 ) .
Ramiro et al .
( 1996 ) have documented that TCRP gene rearrangements are present in the CD4 ISP .
Southern blot analysis of TCRB rearrangements in CD34 * and CD4 ISP populations using JB1- and JB2-specific probes have confirmed the data of Ramiro and collaborators , but also indicated that 85 % of the TCRB alleles are still in the germline configuration ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
We have found , moreover , that almost all ( > 95 % ) CD4 ISP cells have rearranged TCR loci and that 35 % of the alleles have TCRy rearrangements ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
Consistent with the fact that all CD4 ISP cells have one or more TCR genes in rearranged form , they are completely unable to develop into NK cells , indicating that they are fully committed to the T cell lineage .
To investigate whether Id3 influences T cell development after complete commitment to the T cell lineage , CD4 ISP cells were sorted from CD # 8-depleted thymocytes , transduced with viruses harboring either the control IRES-GFP or Id3-IRES-GFP DNAs and cultured for 12 days in an FTOC .
Flow cytometric analysis of one of four representative experiments shown in Figure 3 revealed that 12 % of the cells recovered from the FTOC were GFP¢* , while 5 % of the cells were Id3-~GFP¢* .
The control GFP-transduced CD4 ISP thymocytes developed into CD1atCDS5* cells , of which the majority were CD4TCD8* DP thymocytes ( > 80 % ) ( Figure 3 ) .
Both « B* T cells ( 27 % ) and y5¢* T cells were present ( 0.7 % ) .
As expected , no CD56* NK cells were generated .
The results of the analysis of the Id3-GFP-transduced CD4 ISP thymocytes after FTOC were strikingly different .
Less than 3 % of these cells expressed a TCRB , while 2 % expressed a TCRYy8 .
In terms of percentages , there was even an increase of TCRYy8 cells in the Id3-transduced samples .
However , as shown below , the absolute numbers of TCRy8 cells in both samples are not significantly different .
Thus , while Id3 overexpression strongly inhibited differentiation of CD4 ISP cells into TCRafB cells , development of these cells into TCRYy8 cells was not blocked .
Another dramatic effect was the development of relatively large numbers of CD1a~ CD3-CD4-CD5*CD8~- cells from Id3-transduced CD4 ISP cells as 60 % of these cells lacked expression of CD1a , although all cells expressed CD5 ( Figure 3 ) .
Moreover , 76 % of the Id3-transduced cells lacked CD4 and CD8 ( Figure 3 ) .
The observation that some cells ( 2 % ) were observed that express CD56 and not CD3 may suggest that Id3 overexpression in CD4 ISP permits some of these cells to enter the NK cell lineage .
The effect of Id3 overexpression on TCRy5 development depends on the developmental stage of the transduced progenitor cells The results shown in Figures 2 and 3 contrast with those in our previous study which demonstrated that Id overexpression in uncommitted CD34~* progenitor cells inhibited their development into both TCRB and yd T cells in an FTOC .
This is illustrated more clearly in Table I which summarizes the results of eight experiments ; two with CD34+ fetal liver cells , three with CD1aCD34* thymic precursors and three with committed CD4 ISP cells .
Table I shows that the proportions of IRES-GFP* and Id3-IRES-GFP+* cells before the FTOC are similar .

Three-color flow cytometric analysis of IRES-GFP- and Id3-IRES-GFP-transduced CD4 ISP thymocytes cultured in an FTOC .
CD4 ISP thymocytes were sorted ( > 99 % pure upon reanalysis ) and transduced with the retrovirus containing the control IRES-GFP or the retrovirus expressing Id3-IRES-GFP and cultured in FTOC for 12 days .
Single cell suspensions were prepared and stained with PE-and TRC-conjugated antibodies against different surface antigens .
Flow cytometry was performed and cells were analyzed for the indicated surface markers after gating on the control GFP* cells or the 1Id3-IRES-GFP* cells .
Numbers in the dot plots represent percentages of dots in each quadrant .
Thus the input numbers of Id3- and control-transduced progenitor cells were comparable .
In contrast , the percentages of GFP * cells in Id3-transduced cells after the FTOC were lower than that in the control-transduced cells , which is most likely due to the fact that proliferation induced by B selection does not occur in the Id3-transduced cells ( vide infra ) .
To allow a meaningful assessment of the effect of Id3 on T cell development , we therefore calculated the absolute number of GFP*TCR « fB and GFP*TCRyS* cells harvested from each experiment .
Since the same number of lobes could not always be harvested , and therefore the total cell recoveries of each sample were different , we expressed the number as the amount of GFP+ cells per 108 total ( GFP+ and GFP- ) cells .
Control GFP-transduced cells were not included in two experiments ( experiment 3 with CD1a-CD34* thymocytes and experiment 1 with CD4 ISP cells ) .
In these experiments , we calculated the number of untransduced TCRaf and y65 cells that developed from the same input number as that 2796 of the Id3-transduced cells .
The data presented in Table I clearly indicate that enforced expression of Id3 in CD34* fetal liver ( two experiments ) and CD1a-CD34¢ cells ( three experiments ) strongly blocked development of both TCRaRB and 48 cells .
Id3 expression also inhibited TCRaB development of CD4 ISP cells in all three experiments .
However , the absolute numbers of TCRY8 cells recovered from the Id3- and control-transduced CD4 ISP cells were the same .
These findings indicate that after the T/NK checkpoint , bHLH factors continue to be required for TCRafB but not for TCRY8 development .
Enforced expression of Id3 in CD1a-CD34* cells prevents the appearance of cells with TCRS rearrangements and with upregulated RAG1 and RAGZ2 mRNA and downregulates pT & mRNA In our previous study , we demonstrated that enforced Id3 expression prevents the appearance of TCRRB rearrangements in CD1a CD34 * cells cultured in IL-7 ( Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
To determine whether Id specifically affects rearrangements or whether Id3 interferes with TCR gene rearrangements at other loci as well , we examined the effect of Id3 on TCR8 V8l-J81 rearrangements in CD1a-CD34* cells cultured in IL-7 and stem cell factor ( SCF ) using a PCR technique .
CD1a CD34* cells were sorted , transduced with Id3 or with the control vector and cultured for 6 days in IL-7 .
Since the transduced gene is expressed 2 days after the transduction procedure , Id3 is expressed for the last 4 days of the culture period .
The GFP+ cells were sorted from both cultures , and the DNA was isolated and subjected to a PCR .
Figure 4 shows a band with a very low intensity following Southern blot of the PCR product from DNA of freshly isolated CD1a~ CD34* cells .
This may either reflect a low level of V8l-J81 rearrangements in this population or be due to a few contaminating CD1a*CD34* cells in the cell preparation .
The number of the V8l-J81 rearrangements strongly increased when control-transduced cells were cultured in IL-7 and SCF ( Figure 4 , lane 2 ) and was of the same level as those detected in CD1atCD34* cells isolated in the same sort as cells ( Figure 4 , lane 4 ) .
Enforced expression of Id3 completely inhibited the increase of V8l-J81 rearrangements by IL-7 and SCF ( Figure 4 , lane 3 ) .
The observation that enforced expression of Id3 inhibited induction of both TCR8 and TCRB gene rearrangements by IL-7 and SCF prompted us to investigate the effect of Id3 on expression of RAG1 and RAG2 .
CD1aCD34 * and CD1a*tCD34* cells were sorted , transduced with Id3 or with the control vector and cultured for 6 days in IL-7 .
The GFP* cells were sorted from both cultures , and the RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed .
The cDNA samples were subjected to PCR using primers specific for HPRT , RAG1 and RAG2 .
Figure 5 shows that cells overexpressing Id3 in both CD1a-CD34* ( lanes 6 and 7 ; the two lanes show the bands of undiluted and one-fofth diluted samples , respectively ) and CD1lat CD34* ( lanes 12 and 13 ) have reduced levels of RAG1 and RAG2 compared with the control vector-transduced CD1aCD34+* cells ( lanes 4 and 5 ) and CD1atCD34+* cells ( lanes 10 and 11 ) .
In the same experiment , we also analyzed pT mRNA levels , because it has been demonstrated that pT ' a , a component of the pre-TCR , is Control of T cell development by bHLH proteins Table I .

Based on these data , we calculated the total numbers of GFP* f and y8 cells .
To allow for a comparison of all experiments , we expressed the numbers of recovered af } and 18 cells per 10° total ( GFP+ and GFP ) cells .
In experiments 5 and 6 , we calculated the numbers of untransduced cells that developed from the same input number as Id3-transduced cells .

crucial for optimal development of TCRafB cells , but is not required for development of TCRYy8* cells ( Fehling et al. , 1995 ) .
It is demonstrated in Figure 5 that pTo is strongly downregulated by enforced expression of Id3 , both in CD1a-CD34* ( third panel , lanes 6 and 7 ) and in CD1a*CD34* cells ( third panel , lanes 12 and 13 ) as the intensities of the pTG bands in the Id3-transduced cells are even lower than in the freshly isolated CD1a~ ( lanes 2 and 3 ) and CD1atCD34* cells ( lanes 8 and 9 ) .
We have also determined the intensities of the PCR bands using video densitometry employing the Eagle Eye still video system and Eagle Sight software .
From the measured intensities , we calculated the ratios RAG1 : HPRT , RAG2 : HPRT and pTo : HPRT .
The calculated RAG1 : HPRT ratio for freshly isolated CD1aCD34¢* was 0.04 ; following incubation of the control , the ratio increased to 1.33 , while the ratio in the Id3-transduced sample was 0.07 .
For the CD1a*CD34* samples , the RAG1 : HPRT ratios were 0.76 , 2.1 and 0.5 , respectively .
A similar pattern was observed for RAG2 .
Although these measurements should be interpreted with caution , they suggest that overexpression of Id3 prevented upregulation of Id3 rather than downregulated expression of RAG1 and RAG2 .
The pattern of pT ' a : HPRT ratios was different .
The ratio in the freshly isolated CD1a~ CD34* cells was 0.8 ; following culture , the control gave a ratio of 1.0 while in the Id3-transduced sample the pTo : HPRT ratio was 0.03 .
The pTo : HPRT ratios determined in the CD1a+CD34 * samples were 1.4 , 1.9 and 0.02 , respectively .
These data suggest that Id3 overexpression results in downregulation of pT ' G mRNA .
CD1a CD4 CD3 cells recovered from Id3-IRES-GFP* CD4 ISP thymocytes cultured in FTOC can be expanded with IL-2 and show characteristics of both pre-T cells and NK cells The CD1a-CD3-CD4~ cells ( Figure 3 ) recovered from the FTOC seeded with Id3-IRES-GFP-transduced CD4 ISP cells also expressed CD2 and CD7 ( results not shown ) .
The recovery of these cells was unexpected as no CD3~ CD4~ cells were detected in the FTOC with untransduced or control-transduced CD4 ISP cells .

CD2*CD3-CD4-CD7* cells are reminiscent of CD3 pre-NK cells ( Sanchez et al. , 1993 ) .
As pre-NK cells respond to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) and IL-2 ( Sanchez et al. , 1993 ) , we cultured the cells derived from the FTOC with a feeder mixture of irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) cell line JY , PHA and IL-2 .
The cells recovered from an FTOC seeded with Id3-IRES-GFP-transduced CD4 ISP cells were expandable and in one typical experiment we observed that 66 % of the Id3-GFP* cells lacked CD3 ; the majority of these CD3~ cells expressed the NK marker CD56 ( Figure 6 ) .
In addition , TCRYy68 cells were present in these cultures , a portion of which expressed CD56 .

these cells were shown to have cytotoxic activity against the NK-sensitive target cell line K562 , but not against an NK-resistant EBV-B cell line ( results not shown ) .

This was expected because TCRY8 but not TCRB harvested from the FTOC can be cultured in IL-2 ( Res et al. , 1997 ) .
More importantly , no CD3~ cells were present in these cultures ( Figure 6 ) .
These results indicate that overexpression of Id3 in CD4 ISP cells selectively leads to development of CD3~ cells that have the capacity to respond to IL-2 .
The CD3-CD56+* cells obtained from Id3-transduced CD4 ISP thymic precursors were derived from cells that had undergone TCR gene rearrangements .
This raises the possibility that at least a proportion of the CD1a CD3~ CD4-CD56+* cells , recovered from the FTOC and expanded in IL-2-containing medium , had rearranged TCR genes .
We therefore examined whether TCR and TCRPB rearrangements were present in Id3-GFP*CDS56*CD3~-cells recovered from an FTOC seeded with CD4 ISP Id3-transduced thymocytes .
As a positive control , we analyzed TCR6S and TCRB rearrangements in I43-GFP+*CD56¢* CD3*TCRYyS* T cells derived from the same FTOCs .
After expansion of the cells with feeders , they were sorted in a highly stringent way to completely remove mature cells ( > 99.9 % pure ) and TCR rearrangements were analyzed by PCR .
As a negative control , DNA isolated from an EBV-transformed B cell line was used .
As expected , the Id3-GFP*CD56*CD3*TCRYy8* derived from CD1atCD34* and CD4 ISP cells had rearranged V81-J81 and DJB gene 2798 IRES-GFP 1d3-IRES-GFP u 44 A .

TCR rearrangement analysis on CD3-CD56* cells obtained from Id3-IRES-GFP-transduced cells cultured in an FTOC .
1d3-transduced FL CD34* and Id3-transduced CD1a CD34 * , CD1a*CD34* and CD4 ISP thymocytes were cultured in an FTOC , harvested and expanded for 2 weeks with feeders .
Expanded cultures were sorted ( > 99.9 % pure upon reanalysis ) for Id3-GEP*CD56*CD3~- NK cells and I43-GFP*CD56*CD3* y8* T cells .
NK cells were also obtained from cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-7 and SCF ) -induced CD34*CD38* fetal liver cells and CD1a CD34* thymocytes .
DNA was isolated from these cells and analyzed by PCR for TCR ( first panel ) , TCR D-JB ( second panel ) or TCR VBS-DJ ( third panel ! )
rearrangements using the primer combinations described in the Materials and methods .
Lanes 1-10 contain PCR products amplified from DNA that was isolated from total thymocytes ( lane 1 ) , EBV-B ( lane 2 ) , no DNA ( lane 3 ) , FL CD34*CD38* plus cytokines ( lane 4 ) , fetal liver 143 '' CDS56*CD3~ from the FTOC ( lane 5 ) , CD1a CD34* thymocytes plus cytokines ( lane 6 ) , CD1a*CD34* from the FTOC ( lane 7 ) , CD1a*CD34* from the FTOC ( lane 8 ) , CD4 ISP from the FTOC ( lane 9 ) and CD4 ISP from the FTOC ( lane 10 ) .
segments ( Figure 7 , lanes 8 and 10 , respectively ) while an EBV-B cell line ( lane 2 ) did not reveal either of the two rearranged TCR gene products .
Surprisingly , analysis of DNA isolated from the Id3-GFP*CD56*CD3~ cells , derived from FTOC-incubated Id3-transduced CD1at CD34* and CD4 ISP thymocytes , both revealed V8l-J81 and DJB rearrangements ( Figure 7 , lanes 7 and 9 , respectively ) .
TCRB DJ rearrangements in the Id3-GFP*CD56*CD3~ cells derived from this sample of CD4 ISP thymocytes were very weak but became more clearly visible after a longer exposure time ( data not shown ) .
It can not be excluded completely that the TCR gene rearrangements depicted in lanes 7 and 9 are derived from contaminating CD3* cells but , given the stringency of our sort and the intensities of the bands in the CD3~ samples compared with the CD3¢ samples ( particularly when one compares lanes 9 and 10 ) , we feel confident that the signals are not derived from the few contaminating ( < 0.1 % ) CD3 * cells .
Moreover , although no TCR germline bands were detected in Southern blot analysis of CD4 ISP , not all CD4 ISP cells have V8l to J81 gene rearrangements ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) , making it even less unlikely that the clear V81-J81 rearrangements detected by PCR analysis of the Id3* CD3-CD56* cells were due to contaminating CD3+* cells Complete VBS-DJ rearrangements were not detectable in any subpopulation tested , except in total thymocytes ( Figure 7 , third panel ) , consistent with the fact that only a small minority of the starting CD4 ISP cells have TCRB gene rearrangements ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
It is of note that CD3-CD56+* NK cells obtained from cytokine-induced CD34* fetal liver cells ( lane 4 ) or CD1aCD34+* thymocytes ( lane 6 ) did not have rearrangements at either the TCR6 or TCRB locus .
To exclude the possibility that Id3 induces rearrangements in NK cells , we analyzed NK cells obtained from an FTOC which was seeded with Id3-transduced CD34* fetal liver cells .
We have shown previously that CD34* FL cells do not have rearranged TCR gene segments ( Jaleco et al. , 1997 ) .
Moreover , we observed that incubation of Id3-transduced CD34¢~ FL cells gives rise to many NK cells in an FTOC ( Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
These Id3-GFP*CD56+ NK cells were isolated from cells expanded in a feeder cell mixture , and Figure 7 shows that they had no rearranged TCR genes ( lane 5 ) .
Also , rearrangements of the V82 gene segment , which are associated with fetal T cell development ( Krangel et al. , 1990 ) , were undetectable ( data not shown ) .
Discussion Recently , we have demonstrated that enforced expression of Id3 in human CD34¢ fetal liver cells results in a complete inhibition of TCRaB and TCRYy8 cell development and a developmental arrest of cells at the CD1a~ CD5* stage ( Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
Interestingly , these CDI1aCD5+* cells selectively differentiate into CD3~ CD56+* cells that display NK cell activity ( Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
These findings indicate that bHLH factors are involved in the control of commitment to the T cell lineage at the T/NK branch point .
We now demonstrate that overexpression of Id3 in cells downstream of this branchpoint strongly inhibits development of TCRB T cells , while that of TCRYy8 cells is not inhibited .
This is in contrast to the strong inhibition of TCRYy8 cell development following Id3 expression in CD34¢* fetal liver cells or in CD1a CD34* thymocytes that represent stages before the T/NK split ( Table 1 ) , and indicate that bHLH factors continue to be involved in TCR « f development beyond the T/NK branchpoint .
One possible explanation for our observations is that Id3 overexpression interferes with TCR gene rearrangements .
This may be one mechanism through which 1Id3 inhibits development of uncommitted progenitors into GB and Y8 T cells .
Data from our previous study indicate that Id3 overexpression in CD1a CD34+* thymocytes cultured in IL-7 prevented the appearance of cells with TCRB DJ Control of T cell development by bHLH proteins gene rearrangements ( Heemskerk et al. , 1997 ) .
Here we demonstrate that Id3 overexpression also prevents the appearance of cells with TCR rearrangements in CD1a~ CD34 * cells cultured in IL-7 .
We also observed inhibition of upregulation of RAG1 and RAG2 in cells overexpressing Id3 .
It is possible that TCR gene rearrangements are directly affected by Id3 overexpression .
Since TCR rearrangements commence at a stage downstream of the CD4 ISP stage , in the DP population ( Ramiro et al. , 1996 ; Verschuren et al. , 1998 ) , continued recombinatorial activity is required for development of CD4 ISP cells into TCRafB cells .
One can , therefore , hypothesize that Id3 overexpression in CD4 ISP cells blocks TCR @ RB cell development by inhibiting completion of and initiation of TCR gene rearrangements .
The failure of Id3 to inhibit development of CD4 ISP cells may be attributed to the fact that these cells contain complete TCR8 and y gene rearrangements ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
However , our data do not preclude that Id3 overexpression in uncommitted T cell progenitors results in a developmental arrest at the stage that initiates TCR gene rearrangements and does not affect recombinations directly .
The observed strong inhibition of pTG expression by Id3 overexpression suggests another , perhaps more likely , manner in which Id3 may differentially affect TCRaf and y6 development from committed pre-T cells .
Studies with pTo-deficient mice indicate that this gene is required for optimal development of TCR & f but not of TCRYy8 cells ( Fehling et al. , 1995 ) .
In this respect , it is important to note that the CD4 ISP stage is upstream of the f } selection checkpoint ( Ramiro et al. , 1996 ; Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that enforced expression of Id3 in CD4 ISP cells leads to downregulation of pTC and thereby inhibits the proliferation that accompanies B selection .
This may contribute to or perhaps be completely responsible for the observed inhibition of TCRafB development .
It is unclear whether bHLH factors directly affect pTo gene transcription .
The promotor region of pT has yet to be characterized .
Interestingly , the bHLH protein E47 has been shown directly to control expression of the surrogate light chain genes , the equivalents of pTo in B cell progenitors ( Sigvardsson et al. , 1997 ) .
The hypothesis that Id3 impedes T cell development either by affecting TCR rearrangements or expression or both does not explain the observation that Id3 overexpression in CD1atCD34+* and CD4 ISP cells results in the appearance of CD1aCD3-CD4-CD5¢* cells in an FTOC .
These cells were never observed in FTOCs with untransduced or control GFP-transduced or CD4 ISP cells .
We have considered the possibility that once T cell development is aborted , downregulation of CD1a and CD4 and acquisition of some NK markers occurs by default in our FTOC system .
This is unlikely since enforced expression of constitutively active p56 in CD4 ISP cells strongly inhibited T cell development , but did not result in the appearance of CD1a ~CD3-CD4~ CD5 * cells in an FTOC ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) .
These data indicate that CD1aCD3-CD4-CDS5~* cells appear as a consequence of Id3 overexpression in CD4 ISP cells .
These cells could be expanded following culture in a feeder cell mixture containing IL-2 .
A large proportion of the CD3~ cells in these cultures expressed NK markers such as CD56 ( Figure 6 ) and CD94 ( results not shown ) 2799 B.Blom et al .
and displayed cytotoxic activity .
Consistent with the fact that CD4 ISP cells have > 95 % and 15 % of the TCR and [ } alleles , respectively , in rearranged form ( Blom et al. , 1999 ) , the CD1aCD3-CD4-CD56+ cells derived from CD4 ISP cells contain TCR68 and a low level of TCRB gene rearrangements .
Thus these cells have NK characteristics but they retained properties of pre-T cells .
Since the expanded cells have TCR rearrangements but fail to express a TCR on the cell membrane , we should assume that the observed TCR rearrangements were unproductive .
Our data suggest , therefore , that bHLH factors in CD3~ pre-T cells prevent the loss of CD1a and CD4 and acquisition of the capacity to respond to IL-2 before completion of TCR rearrangements .
The loss of CD1a , CD4 and CD8 and the acquisition of NK markers on cells that develop from Id3-transduced CD4 ISP cells strongly suggest that Id3 overexpression may result in a change of cell fate of some cells from the T into the NK cell lineage .
Experiments to test this interesting possibility are under way .
The identity of the bHLH factors that are critical for T cell development has yet to be determined precisely .
Using an RT-PCR , we have found that early T cell progenitors in the human thymus express E12 , E47 , HEB as well as Id1 and Id3 ( results not shown ) .
The EZ2A and HEB proteins have been implicated in T cell development .
E2A deficiency results in a partial block in T cell differentiation at the transition of CD44*CD25~ cells into CD44®CD25+* cells ( Bain et al. , 19972 ) .
The CD25~- to CD25 * transition is roughly equivalent to the CD1a~ to CD1a* transition in humans ( Blom et al. , 1998 , Spits et al. , 1998 ) .
Mice deficient for another bHLH protein , HEB , have perturbed T cell development with a relative accumulation of double negative and CD3-CD4-CD8* cells in the thymus ( Zhuang et al. , 1996 ) .
Since no further analysis of thymocytes from HEB-deficient mice has been reported ( Zhuang et al. , 1996 ) , the exact T cell developmental stage that is affected in these mice remains to be determined .
Thus , it is likely that sequestration of EZ2A proteins by 1d3 is , at least in part , responsible for the block in T cell differentiation observed following overexpression of Id3 .
It seems likely , however , that other bHLH factors are implicated as well .
The data presented here provide evidence that control of T cell commitment beyond the T/NK checkpoint and completion of development of committed pre-T cells into TCRB cells require the continued activities of bHLH factors .
The power of the retroviral system is also clearly demonstrated here .
Not only does this technology offer a way to genetically modify human T cell development , it also has advantages on its own .
The most important one is that genes can be introduced before or after defined checkpoints of development of individual lineages .
Taking advantage of this feature , one can analyze functions of genes in a way that can not yet be achieved easily using knock-out or transgenic technologies .
Application of this technology to the mouse system and combining this with knock-out technologies will greatly extend the ability to analyze the mechanisms of lymphoid development .
Materials and methods Isolation of subpopulations from thymus Normal human thymocytes were obtained from thymus fragments removed during corrective cardiac surgery of patients aged 1 month to 2800 2 years .
Thymic lobes were minced gently in RPMI-1640 ( Gibco-BRL Life Technologies Ltd , Paisley , UK ) containing 2 % ( v/v ) fetal calf serum ( FCS ; BioWhittaker , Verviers , Belgium ) and antibiotics ( penicillin 500 IU/ml , streptomycin 100 mg/ml , Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals , Germany ) .
Cells were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation ( Lymphoprep , 1.077 g/ml , Nycomed Pharma , Oslo , Norway ) .
Thymocytes recovered from the Ficoll interface were enriched for CD34 * cells using a kit for separation of CD34* cells and a miniMACS ( Miltenyi Biotec Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Cells were sorted after staining with monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) against molecular epitopes different from those recognized by the mAbs used during the miniMACS procedures .
For cell sorting of CD1a CD34 * and CD1a*CD34* subpopulations , cells were incubated with 1 ul/10° cells of CD34-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) ( HPCA-2 , Becton Dickinson & Co. , San Jose , CA ) and 0.5 pJ/lO6 cells of CD1a-phecoerythrin ( PE ) ( T6-RD1 , Coulter Clone , Hialeah , FL ) at 4°C for 30 min .
To enrich for CD4 ISP cells , total thymocytes were depleted twice with CD27 mAb [ 9F4 , gift from Dr R.van Lier , Central Laboratory of Blood transfusion ( CLB ) , Amsterdam ] , CD69 mAb ( L78 , provided by Dr J.H.Phillips , DNAX , Palo Alto , CA ) and magnetic beads ( Dynabeads , Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) .
The depleted thymocytes were stained with CD4-PE ( Leu3a , Becton Dickinson ) , CD3-FITC ( Leuda ) , and CD8 @ -tricolor ( TRC ; 3B5 , Caltag Laboratories , South San Francisco , CA ) and sorted on the basis of CD4*CD3-CD8~ expression .
Cells were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting on a FACStar Plus ( Becton Dickinson ) equipped with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm .
During the sorting procedure , cells were kept at 4°C .
All fractions used in the subsequent experiments were reanalyzed after sorting and contained > 99 % of the cells in the selected sort gates .
Retroviral constructs and transduction A LZRS retroviral vector was constructed comprising the Id3 cDNA ( generous gift of Dr C. Murre , UCSD , San Diego , CA ) and the enhanced GFP ( obtained from Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) as a marker gene .
The cDNAs were separated by the sequence of the IRES in order to allow individual translation of the bicistronic mRNA containing both Id3 and GFP ( Id3-IRES-GFP ) without generating a fusion protein ( Davies and Kaufman , 1992 ; Pestova et al. , 1996 ; Sachs et al. , 1997 ) .
As a control , we made a retroviral vector containing the IRES-GFP sequence only ( IRES-GEP ) .
Helper virus-free recombinant retroviruses ( titre 10°/ml , as determined by transduction of mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells ) were produced after transfection of the retroviral constructs into the 293T-based @ NX-A amphotropic packaging cell line ( Kinsella and Nolan , 1996 ) ( provided by Dr G.Nolan , Stanford University , CA ) and selection on puromycin .
Progenitor cells were purified from thymus and cultured overnight in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-7 ( R & D systems , Abingdon , UK ) and 10 ng/ml SCF ( R & D ) followed by incubation for 7-8 h or overnight with virus supernatant in plates coated with 30 ug/ml recombinant human fibronectin fragment CH-296 ( RetroNectin ' '' ; Takara , Otsu , Japan ) ( Kimizuka et al. , 1991 ; Hanenberg et al. , 1996 , 1997 ) .
Hybrid human-mouse fetal thymic organ cultures The in vitro development of human T cells from CD1a*CD34* and CD4 ISP progenitor cells was studied using the hybrid human-mouse FTOC ( Res et al. , 1996 ) .
Fetal thymuses were obtained from embryos of RAG1-deficient mice on day 15-16 of gestation .
The lobes were treated with 1.35 mM deoxyguanosine ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) for 5 days before incubation with human progenitor cells in a hanging drop culture for 2 days followed by incubation on an air-liquid interface .
Culture medium consisted of Yssel 's medium ( Yssel et al. , 1984 ) supplemented with 2 % normal human serum and 5 % FCS .
To analyze differentiation of human cells , the thymuses were dispersed into single cell suspensions and stained with mAbs specific for human cell surface antigens .
Expansion cultures Cells recovered from the FTOC were expanded at a cell density of 3X10 % /ml in Yssel 's medium containing a mixture of irradiated PBMC ( 10 % /ml ; 3000 rad ) , the EBV cell line JY ( 10°/ml ; 5000 rad ) , PHA ( 100 ng/ml : Murex Diagnostics Ltd , Dartford , UK ) and IL-2 ( 20 IU/ml ; Chiron , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) .
Under these conditions , we can expand NK cells and y8* T cells , but not « B* T cells from an FTOC ( Res et al. , 1997 ) .
Flow cytometric analysis GFP-transduced human cells recovered from the hybrid mouse FTOC cultures were analyzed by three-color flow cytometric analysis on a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson ) after incubation for 30 min with the following antibodies conjugated with the fluorochromes PE or TRC : CD3 ( Leu-4 ) , CD4 ( Leu-3a ) , CD8 ( Leu-2 ) , CD2 ( Leu-5b ) , CD7 ( Leu-9 ) , CD5 ( Leu-1 ) , CD45RA ( Leu-18 ) ( all from Becton Dickinson ) , anti-TCRaB and anti-TCRYy§ ( Immunotech , Marseille , France ) , CD56 ( NCAM 16.2 , Becton Dickinson ) and CD1a ( T6-RD1 , Coulter Clone ) .
Data were analyzed with the Cell Quest program ( Becton Dickinson ) .
RT-PCR assays RNA was isolated from flow cytometric-sorted human postnatal thymocyte subpopulations using TRIzol reagent ( Gibco-BRL ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and reverse transcribed using a poly ( dT ) ; s oligonucleotide and 400 U of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase ( Gibco-BRL ) at 37°C for 1 h. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed essentially as described previously ( Blom et al. , 1997 ) .
PCR assays were done in 30 pil reaction volumes using the appropriate diluted amounts of cDNA template , 2 mM MgCl , , 0.25 mM each dNTP , 10 pmol of each primer and 0.8 U of Taq polymerase ( Gibco-BRL ) in 1X buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCI ] pH 8.5 , 50 mM KC ] .
Reaction conditions were as follows : 5 min denaturing step at 95°C followed by 31 cycles of 1 min at 95°C , 1 min at 55°C and 1 min at 72°C .
PCR products were separated on 1 % agarose gels , stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed by video densitometry using the Eagle Eye still video system and Eagle Sight software ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
The RAG1 , RAG2 , pT and HPRT primers that were used are : HPRT sense , 5'-TATGGACAGG-ACTGAACGTCTTGC-3 ' ; HPRT antisense , 5'-GACACAAACATGAT-TCAAATCCCTGA-3 ' ; RAG1 - sense , 5'-GAACACACTTTGCCT-TCTCTTTGG-3 ' ; RAG1 antisense , CGTT-3 ' ; RAG2 sense , 5 '' -TGTGAATTGCACAGTCTTGCCAGG-3 ' ; RAG2 antisense , pTa sense , 5-GTCCAGCCCTACCCACAGGTGT-3 ' ; and pTQ antisense , 5-CGGGAATTCGACGTCCCTGGCTGTAGAAGCCTCTC-3 ' .
TCRO gene rearrangement analysis by PCR TCR gene rearrangements were analyzed by using DNA of ~10* cells in a genomic DNA PCR assay .
Isolation of DNA and PCR of TCR gene rearrangements was done as described ( Breit et al. , 1991 , 1993 ) .
TCR & 8 PCR was carried out using forward V8l ( 5'-TGAGGAAAGCAGT-CACCCTGAAC-3 ' ) or V82 ( 5'-ACCAAACAGTGCCTGTGTCAAT-AGG-3 ' ) and J81 reverse ( S'-ACCTCTTCCCAGGAGTCCTCC-3 ' ) primers .
TCRB D-J PCR was carried out using DBIL.1 forward ( 5'-TGGTGGTCTCTCCCAGGCTCT-3 ' ) and JBL.3-1.4 reverse ( 5'-CCA-GCTGTCCAGCCTTGACTT-3 ' ) primers .
A 10 pl aliquot of the PCR products was run on a 2 % agarose gel followed by DNA transfer to a nylon filter ( Hybond N* , Amersham , UK ) .
Filters were pre-hybridized at 55°C for at least 1 h ( 6X SSC , 0.5 % SDS , 5X Denhardt 's , 100 mg herring sperm DNA per litre ) and hybridized overnight with a labeled oligoprobe specifically recognizing V81-181 ( 5'-TGAGGAAA-GCAGTCACCCTGAAC-3 ' ) or TCRB DfBpan ( 5-CAAAGCTGT-AACATTGTGGGGAC-3 ' ) PCR products internal to the PCR primers .
To control for the amount of DNA used in the PCR , we amplified the RAG2 gene by using RAG2 forward ( 5-TGTGAATTGCACAGT-CTTGCCAGG-3 ' ) and RAG2 reverse ( 5-GGGTITGTTGAGCTCA-GTTGAATAG-3 '' ) primers , which we detected with a RAG2 oligoprobe ( 5-CAAGATATGGTTTGGAAGCAACATGGGAAA-3 ' ) .
Filters were washed with an excess amount of 2 % X SSC ; 0.1 % SDS at 50°C for 30 min and exposed to an autoradiographic film .
