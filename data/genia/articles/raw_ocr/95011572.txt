Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy-chain locus but not their light chain genes , suggesting that an active v-abJ protein interferes with this differentiation step .
To test this hypothesis , light-chain gene structure was examined in pre-B cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of the Abelson virus and in derivatives that survive at the nonpermissive temperature because they express a human BCL-2 gene .
Our studies reveal that inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase triggers high-frequency rearrangement of x and A light-chain genes .
These events are accompanied by marked increases in the expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs .
These increases occur in the absence of protein synthesis but are dependent on inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase .
As documented in the accompanying paper ( Klug et al. , this issue ) , an active v-abl protein also suppresses the activity of NF- « B/rel and expression controlled by the x intron enhancer .
Together these data demonstrate that the v-abl protein specifically interferes with light-chain gene rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of B-cell differentiation and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating RAG gene expression .

Pre-B cells transformed by the v-abl oncogene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus ( Ab-MuLV ) have been the principal tumor model used to study immunoglobulin gene recombination ( for review , see Rosenberg and Witte 1988 ; Schatz et al .
1992 ) .
As with their normal counterparts , most of the transformants have rearranged their heavy-chain locus and many express p protein .
However , unlike normal pre-B cells , the transformants appear frozen at the pre-B cell stage and do not rearrange light-chain genes or mature to surface immunoglobulin M ( Ig M ) -positive B cells .
This failure is perplexing because the cells rearrange substrates containing recombination signal sequences , the recognition elements that mediate antigen receptor gene rearrangement [ Lewis et al .
1984 ; Lieber et al .
1987 ) .
In addition , many of the transformants actively complete heavy chain gene assembly in culture , joining V ( H ) to DJ ( H ) elements [ Alt et al .
1984 ; Reth et al .
1986 ) .
Consistent with these fea-tures , the cells express both the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes ( Schatz et al .
1989 ; Oettinger et al .
1990 } , the products of which are absolutely required for antigen receptor gene assembly ( Mombaerts et al .
1992 ; Shinkai et al .
1992 ) .

The phenotype of Ab-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells suggests that transformation specifically interferes with light-chain gene rearrangement .
This model predicts that the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the v-abl protein affects the expression or function of at least one molecule that is required for this phase of rearrangement .
Candidate targets could include transcription factors involved in the expression of the light-chain loci .
Expression of the participating elements is tightly correlated with rearrangement ( Yancopoulos and Alt 1985 ; Schlissel and Baltimore 1989 ; Oltz et al .
1993 ) , and expression of the k locus is usually negligible in Ab-MuLV transformants ( Schlissel and Baltimore 1989 ) .
Other targets could be factors that affect chromatin structure in the region ( Engler et al .
1991 , 1993 ; Jenuwein et al .
1993 ) .
Products required for all antigen receptor gene rearrange-ment , such as those encoded by the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes ( Schatz et al .
1989 ; Octtinger et al .
1990 ; Mom-baerts et al .
1992 ; Shinkai et al .
1992 ) , could also be affected .
Little is known about the levels required to activate or sustain rearrangement and limiting amounts of one or both of these products could inhibit rearrangement at the light-chain loci .

At the permissive temperature , these cells are similar to wild-type { wt ) transformants in differentiation parameters and express an active v-abl protein tyrosine kinase .
At the nonpermissive temperature , the v-abl kinase is inactive in ts transformants , and the cells undergo apoptosis ( Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) .
However , derivatives of the ts transformants that express a human BCL-2 gene ( Hockenberry et al .
1990 } survive at the nonpermissive temperature .
A high frequency of these cells undergo light-chain gene rearrangement soon after shift to this temperature .
Rearrangement is accompanied by increased expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs , changes that occur coincident with the loss of v-abl protein tyrosine kinase activity and do not require protein synthesis or elevated expression of BCL 2 .
The accompanying paper ( Klug et al. , this issue ) demonstrates that the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase suppresses activation of NF- « B/rel and expression controlled by the x intron enhancer .
Together , these data document the first instance in which high-frequency light-chain gene rearrangement can be triggered in a controlled fashion and implicate tyrosine phosphorylation as a central mechanism controlling expression of at least two pathways important for this differentiation event .
Results BCL-2 allows survival of the ts transformants at the nonpermissive temperature To facilitate analysis of the ts transformants , we asked whether BCL-2 would promote survival of the ts transformants at the nonpermissive temperature .
Two ts transformants , DE and 103 , and a cell line transformed by wt Ab-MuLV ( WTl ) were transfected with pSFFV-BCL-2nl , a vector that expresses the human BCL-2 gene and a neomycin resistance gene ( Hockenberry et al .
1990 ) .
G418-resistant clones were selected and screened by Western blotting with an anti-human BCL antibody ( McDonnell et al .
1990 ) to identify those that expressed the introduced gene .
All of the G418-resistant clones tested expressed the human BCL-2 protein [ Fig .
1A ; data not shown ) .
The anti-human BCL-2 antibody did not react with proteins expressed by the parental cell lines or by cell lines that were transfected with a plasmid expressing only the neomycin resistance gene ( Fig .
1A ; data not shown ) .
To test the effect of BCL-2 expression on cell survival , the transfectants were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature , and cell number and viability were monitored ( Fig .
1B ) .
Unlike the parental ts cells or cells transfected with the control plasmid , ~50 % of the ts cells expressing BCL-2 survived for > 2 weeks at the nonpermissive temperature .
As expected , the cells remained in the G , phase of the cell cycle throughout this period [ data not shown ) , but resumed normal growth after shift back to the permissive temperature .

{ A ) } The ts transformant 103 was transfected with pSFFV-BCL-2n1 , a plasmid expressing the human BCL-2 gene and a gene encoding neomycin resistance or a plasmid expressing neo only .
G418-resistant clones were expanded and analyzed for expression of BCL-2 protein by using Western blotting ( McDonnell et al .
1990 ] .
The blot was probed with the anti-human BCL-2 hamster monoclonal antibody 6C # 8 .

Cell number and viability were monitored by trypan blue exclusion for 14 days .
The cultures were then shifted to the permissive temperature and the experiment was continued for 6 days .
The numbers shown are the averages of triplicate samples , which varied by < 10 % .
This experiment is representative of identical analyses with three independently derived 103/BCL-2 clones ; each cell line was evaluated at least twice .
had no effect on the growth or survival of ts cells at the permissive temperature or on wt transformants maintained at either temperature [ data not shown ) .
Recombinase activity is increased in the ts transformants at the nonpermissive temperature The ability of cells to recombine recombination signal sequences is an indicator of an active recombinase system ( Hesse et al .
1987 ; Lieber et al .
1987 ) .
To determine GENES & DEVELOPMENT 689 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Chen et al .
whether changes in the recombinase activity of the ts transformants occurred when the cells were maintained at the nonpermissive temperature , these cells and wt transformants were tested by using extrachromosomal recombination substrates .
These plasmid substrates carry the genes for ampicillin and chloramphenicol re-sistance , but the gene specifying chloramphenicol resistance is expressed only if recombination occurs .
Thus , the frequency of plasmids recovered from cells that confer resistance to both drugs is a measure of recombinase activity ( Hesse et al .
1987 ; Lieber et al .
1987 ) .
As expected , all of the transformants displayed recombinase activities typical of Ab-MuLV-transformed cells ( Lieber et al , 1987 ; Ramakrishnan and Rosenberg 1988 ) when grown at the permissive temperature ( Table 1 ) .
However , when the ts cells were grown at the nonpermissive temperature , recombinase activities increased 4- to 11 -fold .
None of the wt transformants tested showed increased recombinase activity at the nonpermissive temperature .
Although BCL-2 was used to maintain some of the ts transformants at the nonpermissive temperature , expression of this gene was not required for the temperature-dependent increases in recombinase activity .
High-frequency « light-chain gene rearrangement is activated at the nonpermissive temperature in the ts transformants The results of the recombinase assays suggested that dif- ferentiation-related changes might occur when the ts transformants are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature .
As with most Ab-MuLV transformants ( Alt et al .
1984 ) , ts DE and 103 and wt WTI appear arrested at the pre-B cell stage and have nonproductive heavy-chain rearrangements ( data not shown ) and germ-line « and A light-chain genes .
To determine whether incubation at the nonpermissive temperature released the differentiation arrest , the structure of the x loci in the BCL-2-pos-itive derivatives of 103 was compared with that found in representative WTIl transformants by using Southern blotting .
In this assay , fragments of a size distinct from germ line are scored as rearrangements .
Because many different rearrangements occur in the population , multiple fragments of different sizes are usually detected .
No k rearrangements were detected in the WT clones even after 11 days at the nonpermissive temperature ( Fig .
2A ; data not shown ) .
However , multiple x rearrangements were visible in the 103-derived clones after as little as 24-48 hr at the nonpermissive temperature ( Fig .
2B ) .
Similar results were obtained with the ts DE cell line { data not shown ) .
PCR analyses , which detected rearrangements to the four functional / { « ) elements , revealed a similar pattern and demonstrated that expression of BCL-2 was not required for x rearrangement [ Fig .
2C ) .

2C ) are similar to those observed in many Ab-MuLV-transformed cells lines ( Schlissel and Baltimore 1989 ; Shapiro et al .
1993 ; Y. Chen et al. , unpubl . } .
Importantly , this level did not change when wt transformants were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature .
Although 39.5°C is the standard nonpermissive temperature used with the ts Ab-MuLV mutants , inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase activity and activation of x rear v-abl suppresses light-chain rearrangement rangement occur at 37°C ( not shown ) .
Thus , neither expression of BCL-2 nor incubation at what might be considered an abnormally high temperature is required to activate high levels of x rearrangement .
Rearrangements involving k and A genes and RS sequences occur at the nonpermissive temperature In addition to rearranging the x locus , B-lineage cells can rearrange the \ light-chain locus and sequences 3 '' of C , called RS ( Durdik et al .
1984 ; Graninger et al .
1988 ) .
To examine the frequency of cells that underwent such rearrangements at the nonpermissive temperature , the 103/BCL-2/4 clone was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature for 4 days , shifted back to the permissive temperature , and subcloned .
DNAs from these clones were examined by Southern blotting , an assay that reveals rearrangements as fragments that are distinct in size from the unrearranged or germ-line fragment characteristic of nonlymphoid cells .
All but 2 of the 18 subclones analyzed had undergone rearrangement involving at least one of these sequences ( Fig .
3 ) .
Rearrangements involving the k locus occurred in 15 clones .
In most of these cases , germ-line sequences were no longer detected .
Rearrangements involving the A locus were detected in 6 clones , and 13 had rearranged their RS sequences .
Of the 15 clones that had rearranged the k locus , 13 had rearranged both x alleles ; at least 4 of these subclones showed evidence of both RS and A rearrangements .
None appeared to be rearranged only at the A locus .
Analyses of the structure of the T-cell receptor B locus revealed that none of the clones had rearranged these sequences ( data not shown } , demonstrating that the recombinase machinery retained lineage fidelity at the nonpermissive temperature .
Consistent with the analysis of bulk populations , examination of a panel of 103/BCL-2/4 subclones derived after continuous growth at the permissive temperature revealed that only 1 of 30 k alleles had undergone rearrangement ( data not shown ) .
Thus , incubation at the nonpermissive temperature triggers high-frequency rearrangement of all light-chain loci .
RAG-1 , RAG-2 , and x expression increase with v-abl inactivation The tyrosine kinase activity of the v-abl protein is reduced when the ts transformants are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature ( Engelman and Rosenberg 1990 ; Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) .
To determine whether this decrease correlated with differentiation-related changes , the temporal relationship between reduced cellular phosphotyrosine and the expression of RAG-1 , RAG-2 , and xk RNAs , three markers associated with rearrangement ( Schlissel and Baltimore 1989 ; Lennon and Perry 1990 ; Oettinger et al .
1990 ) , was examined .
Decreases in cellular phosphotyrosine could be detected between 4 and 6 hr after shift to the nonpermissive temperature ( Fig .
4 ) .
Increases in the levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs appeared at this time , rising to levels that were 10- to 20-fold higher than those found in cells GENES & DEVELOPMENT 691 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Chen et al .

Germ-line k RNAs also appeared as v-abl protein kinase activity decreased [ Fig .
4 ) .
These molecules could not be detected reproducibly by Northern blotting in samples from cells maintained at the permissive temperature .
Similar results were obtained with several other independently derived ts transformants .
The ts transformants are arrested in the G , phase of the cell cycle at the nonpermissive temperature , a condition that could affect the levels of RAG RNAs .
To examine this issue , ts cells were synchronized at the 692 GENES & DEVELOPMENT permissive temperature and the levels of RAG RNAs were examined in cells in early G , and in cells at the G , /S boundary ( Fig .
5 ) .
As expected for cells in G , ( Matsushime et al .
1991 } , these samples contained increased levels of G , -cyclin 2 RNA .
However , no increases were observed in the levels of RAG RNAs .
In addition , when ts cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature were shifted back to the permissive temperature , levels of RAG RNAs decreased before significant numbers of cells exited G , [ Fig .
5 ; data not shown ) .
These data indicate that inactivation of v-abl protein tyrosine kinase is a critical factor in stimulating light-chain gene rearrangement in the ts pre-B cells .
Increases in levels of RAG RNAs occur in the absence of protein synthesis To probe the mechanism by which v-ab !
inactivation induces the dramatic changes in RAG RNA levels , the stability of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures was examined .
ts 103/ BCL-2 cells were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature for 20 hr and then actinomycin D was added to these cells and to a parallel culture that had been maintained at the permissive temperature .

However , densitometric analyses of multiple experiments revealed that the half-life of RAG-1 RNA was ~45-60 min at both temperatures .
The half-life of RAG-2 RNA was ~30 min at the permissive temperature and ~45-60 min at the nonpermissive temperature .
Similar ranges have been observed by others using B-lineage cells ( Ma et al .
1992 ) .
These data suggest that increased expression of RAG RNAs is mediated largely at the transcriptional level and imply that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in controlling the expression of these genes .
The time-course experiments demonstrate that changes in RAG RNA expression are detected soon after shift to the nonpermissive temperature .
To understand the steps involved in this process , we asked whether protein synthesis was required for increased expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs .
Analysis of cells treated with cycloheximide revealed that RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNA levels increased in the absence of protein synthesis [ Fig .
7 ) .
Importantly , this increase was observed only at the nonpermissive temperature , reinforcing the role of v-abl protein inactivation in the process .
Cells maintained at the permissive temperature in the presence of cycloheximide for the times shown retain an active v-ab !
protein because of the relatively long half-life of this molecule v-abl suppresses light-chain rearrangement { data not shown ) .
When considered in the context of the time course and actinomycin D experiments , these data suggest that the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase mediates down-regulation of RAG-1 and RAG-2 gene expression in a fairly direct fashion .
Discussion Our data demonstrate that an active v-abl protein interferes with immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangement in transformed pre-B cells , providing a mechanistic explanation for the phenotype of most Ab-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells .
This property of v-abl may play an important role in tumorigenesis in vivo .
During this multistep process ( Green et al .
1989 ) , v-abl-stimulated precursors would be refractory to control mechanisms that regulate normal B-cell growth because they fail to rearrange light-chain genes and express IgM .

phenomenon may play a role in BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphocytic leukemias ( Sawyers et al .
1991 ) .
Data presented in the accompanying paper ( Klug et al. , this issue ) reveal that the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase suppresses NF- « B/rel activity .
This response may modulate the differentiation of other hematopoietic target cells such as the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and immature T cells .
The basic idea that the phenotype of transformants can be explained by effects of the abl protein tyrosine kinase on products that control differentiation almost certainly applies to these situations .
Expression of the human BCL-2 gene prolonged the survival of the ts transformants at the nonpermissive temperature .
The response of the ts cells is similar to that observed with a variety of hematopoietic cells [ Vaux et al .
1988 ; Hockenberry et al .
1990 ; Nunez et al .
1990 ; Rolink et al .
1993 ) .
Most Ab-MuLV transformants , as with normal pre-B cells ( Li et al .
1993 ) , express low to undetectable levels of endogenous BCL-2 RNAs at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperature ( M.S .
Huang and N. Rosenberg , unpubl . ) .
Presumably , these low levels are not sufficient to rescue the cells .
Although BCL-2 expression was very useful for prolonging cell survival , we could find no evidence that it played a direct role in any of the differentiation events observed .
Light-chain rearrangement in the ts cells occurs while the cells are arrested in G , ( Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) .
This situation may mimic that observed in normal cells because at least some normal pre-B cells are resting when light-chain gene rearrangement occurs { Hardy et al .
1991 ; Rolink et al .
1993 ) .
However , withdrawal from 694 GENES & DEVELOPMENT the cell cycle is probably not required to trigger differentiation-related events .
Increased levels of RAG RNAs can be detected within 4-6 hr after shift to the nonpermissive temperature .
At this time point , < 10 % of the population has undergone G , arrest ( Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) .
In addition , when ts cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature are shifted back to the permissive temperature , the level of RAG RNAs returns to baseline within 4-6 hr , although the cells have not exited G , .
Our data do not exclude a role for cell cycle-mediated changes in RAG-1 or RAG-2 protein function .
However , they do indicate that the changes in phosphorylation of RAG-2 protein postulated to occur at the G , /S border ( Lin and Desiderio 1993 ) are not required to stimulate rearrangement .
One pathway important for v-abl-mediated differentiation arrest involves suppression of the x intron enhancer ( Klug et al. , this issue ) .
This element is critical for k rearrangement ( Takeda et al .
1993 ) .
The active v-ab !
protein exerts its effect on the k intron enhancer by suppressing NF- « B/rel through a post-translational mechanism that increases the stability of IxBa ( Klug et al. , this issue ) .
Consistent with these effects , inactivation of the v-abl protein kinase triggers expression of k RNAs , an event long correlated to k rearrangement in a variety of systems [ Atchison and Perry 1987 ; Lenardo et al .
1987 ; Schlissel and Baltimore 1989 ; Lennon and Perry 1990 ) .
The specific relationship of these effects to k rearrangement is consistent with the observation that most Ab-MuLV transformants contain an active recombinase system ( Lieber et al , 1987 ; Ramakrishnan and Rosenberg 1988 ) , and many actively rearrange the heavy-chain locus in vitro ( Alt et al .
1984 ; Reth et al .
1986 ) .
This latter rearrangement event is correlated to expression of both germ-line V ( H ) and DJ ( H ) segments , common properties of Ab-MuLV transformants that are not mediated by NF- « B ( Alt et al .
1982 ; Yancopoulos and Alt 1985 ; Lenardo and Baltimore 1989 ) .
A second response to the loss of v-ab !
protein tyrosine kinase is increased expression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes .
These increases occur in the absence of protein synthesis suggesting that the v-abl protein affects expression of these genes in a fairly direct fashion .
NF- « kB/ rel probably does not mediate this effect .
These factors can be activated by inhibiting protein synthesis in the presence of an active v-abl protein ( Sen and Baltimore 1986 ; Klug et al. , this issue ) , whereas increased RAG expression requires an inactive v-abl protein .
Because there is little evidence that v-ab !
protein is present in the nucleus , it seems more likely that factors that regulate RAG expression are regulated negatively by v-abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation .
Virtually nothing is known about the transcriptional regulation of the RAG genes .
Thus , identifying these candidate v-abl targets will require considerable effort .
Nonetheless , RAG gene expression is tightly regulated during lymphoid differen-tiation , and it is tempting to speculate that tyrosine phosphorylation , mediated by one or more of the protein tyrosine kinases expressed during T- and B-cell differentiation [ Perlmutter et al .
1993 ) , plays a key role in regu- Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press lating these genes .
Consistent with this hypothesis , overexpression of the Ick protein tyrosine kinase has been shown to inhibit rearrangement of the T-cell receptor B genes ( Anderson et al .
1992 ) .
The high level of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNA expression , reflected in increased levels of both proteins { M.S .
Huang , Y.Y .
Chen. , W.-C .
Lin. , S. Desiderio , and N. Rosenberg , unpubl .
) , is probably responsible for the dramatic increases in recombinase activity found at the nonpermissive temperature .
High levels of these proteins may be required to trigger light-chain rearrangement in the majority of transformants in the population .
This idea is consistent with the fact that x rearrangement occurs only at low levels in wt transformants even when lipopolysaccharide treatment activates NF- « B/rel and expression of germ-line xk RNAs ( Schlissel and Baltimore 1989 ) .
It is likely that changes in both the k locus and the levels of RAG are important for rearrangement and that v-abl-mediated effects on both of these control points work together to suppress rearrangement .
Consistent with this idea , expression of the RAG genes induces rearrangement of neither endogenous immunoglobulin genes in cells such as NIH-3T3 ( Oettinger et al .
1990 ) or recombination substrates that are not expressed ( Oltz et al .
1993 ) .
An important feature of the ts transformants is that inactivation of v-ab !
not only triggers rearrangement of k but also RS and A sequences .
Increased expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 and activation of NF- « xB/rel and the k intron enhancer are almost certainly important for these events .
Because inhibition of protein synthesis alone does not up-regulate RAG expression but can induce some activation of NF- « B/rel , at least two signaling pathways are probably involved in these events .
Other events may be important as well .
Activation of NF- « B/ rel and expression of germ-line k RNAs is not sufficient for high-frequency x rearrangement ( Schlissel and Baltimore 1989 ; Klug et al. , this issue ) .
In addition , there is no evidence to suggest that NF- « B/rel is involved in rearrangement of A sequences ( Hagman et al .
1990 ) and k rearrangement is not absolutely required for A rearrangement ( Chen et al .
1993 ; Zou et al .
1993 ] .
Thus , additional important regulatory elements may remain to be identi-fied .
The ts transformants should provide a powerful system for the identification of such factors .
Materials and methods Cell culture The ts Ab-MuLV transformants DE , 103 , DF , and O were transformed using the Ab-MuLV-P120/G+H strain and the wt Ab-MuLV transformants WTl , WT2 , WT3 , and WT4 were transformed using Ab-MuLV-P120 or Ab-MuLV-P160 ( Engelman and Rosenberg 1990 } .
All cells were grown routinely at 34°C , the permissive temperature for the ts Ab-MuLV mutants .
The nonpermissive temperature used in all experiments was 39.5°C .
To obtain transfectants expressing the human BCL-2 gene , 8x 10° cells were electroporated ( 250 V , 960 uF in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar ) in the presence of 5 ug of Sall-linearized spleen focus-forming virus ( SFFV ) -BCL-2nl ( Hockenberry et al .
1990 ) .
After v-abl suppresses light-chain rearrangement 48 hr , 1.5 mg/ml of G418 was added to the cultures ; individual clones of G418-resistant cells were isolated 14-21 days later .
The transfectants were maintained in standard growth medium ( Engelman and Rosenberg 1990 ) supplemented to contain 1 mg/ ml of G418 .
To derive subclones that had been exposed to the nonpermissive temperature , the 103/BCL-2/4 clone was shifted to 39.5°C for 4 days and then shifted back to 34°C .
Two days later , the cells were plated in microtiter wells at a density of 0.3 , 1 , and 3 cells/well .
After 3-5 days , wells that contained single clones of growing cells were identified by inspecting the cultures under a microscope .
Cells in these wells were expanded .
Drug treatments To obtain cell populations synchronized in early G , , cells were treated with 0.05 mg/ml of nocodazole and released as described previously ( Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) .
To obtain cell populations arrested at the G , /S interface , exponentially growing cells were treated with 1 mm hydroxyurea ( Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) .
Cell cycle analyses were conducted as described elsewhere ( Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) and confirmed that all synchronized populations displayed the anticipated pattern .
For experiments using actinomycin D , ts cells maintained continuously at 34°C and a sister culture maintained for 20 hr at 39.5°C were used .
Both populations were treated with 10 ug/ml of actinomycin D , returned to 39.5°C or 34°C incubators , and sampled at intervals thereafter .
For experiments using cycloheximide , cells maintained continuously at 34°C were treated with 10 pg/ml of cycloheximide , incubated at either 34°C or 39.5°C , and sampled at intervals thereafter .
Western blotting Cell lysates for analysis of BCL-2 expression were prepared as described ( McDonnell et al .
1990 ) .
The amount of protein in each lysate was quantitated using the BCA protein assay kit ( Pierce } , and 100 pg of each sample was fractionated through a 12.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
The proteins were electrotrans-ferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( U.S. Biochemi-cal ) , and the membranes were blocked in TBS { 10 mm Tris ( pH 8.0 } , 150 mm NaCl ] containing 4 % bovine serum albumin ( frac-tion V ; ICN ) .
The membranes were rinsed in TBST { TBS supplemented to contain 0.05 % Tween 20 ) and incubated with the 6C8 hamster anti-human BCL-2 monoclonal antibody ( McDonnell et al .
1990 ] for 2 hr .
The membranes were rinsed in TBST and exposed to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-hamster IgG antibody { ( U.S. Biochemical ) .
After washing in TBST , the membranes were placed in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris ( pH 9.5 ) , 100 mm NaCl , 5 mm MgCl , , 330 ug of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/ml , and 150 ug of nitro blue tetrazolium /m !
( both from Promega ) for 2-5 min .
The en-zymatic reaction was stopped by rinsing the membranes in distilled water .
The analysis of cellular phosphotyrosine was performed as described previously ( Chen and Rosenberg 1992 ) except that the CSPD chemiluminescent substrate ( Tropix ) was used exactly as recommended by the manufacturer .
DNA and RNA analysis The procedures for preparation of eukaryotic DNA and RNA have been described previously ( Ramakrishnan and Rosenberg 1988 ) .
DNAs were digested with the appropriate restriction en-zyme , fractionated through 0.8 % agarose gels , and transferred to Nytran membranes { Schleicher & Schuell ) .
After UV cross-link-ing , the membranes were hybridized to labeled probes as recommended by the manufacturer .
RNAs were fractionated GENES & DEVELOPMENT 695 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Chen et al .
through 0.8 % formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to Nytran membranes , and the filters were hybridized as recommended by the manufacturer .
Probes were labeled with [ a-* > P ) dCTP ( DuPont ] by using a random priming kit ( Boe-hringer-Mannheim ) .
The 6.5-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pECK ( Coleclough et al .
1981 ) was used to examine the /x re-gion ; a 0.4-kb EcoRI fragment containing V ( Al ) -/ ( A1 ) was used to examine the Ig\ locus ; the 0.8-kb fragment from the RS region ( Durdik et al , .
1984 ) was used to examine RS ; the 0.68-kb PstI fragment from pUCBg700 ( Schatz et al .
1989 ) was used to detect RAG-1 ; the 2.0-kb EcoRV-NotI fragment from pR2RSK *1 ( Oettinger et al .
1990 ) was used to detect RAG-2 ; the 0.7-kb EcoRI fragment from pCN3-CYL2 ( Matsushime et al .
1991 ) was used to detect G , -cyclin 2 .
Recombinase assays The extrachromosomal recombinase assay was carried out as described previously ( Hesse et al .
1987 ; Ramakrishnan and Rosenberg 1988 ) and was performed at least twice on all cell lines .
Briefly , cells were transfected at the permissive temperature with pJH289 or pJH201 using the DEAE-dextran method .
Immediately after the transfection , half of the sample was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature and the other half was maintained at the permissive temperature .
After 20-24 hr , extrachromosomal DNA was prepared , treated with Dpnl , and maximum efficiency Escherichia coli DHS « cells { BRL ) were transformed .
Some of the cells were plated on plates containing ampicillin and others were plated on plates containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol .
The recombinase activity was calculated as ( number of ampicillin-chloramphenicol-resistant colo-nies/number of ampicillin-resistant colonies ] x 100 .
Plasmids were recovered from randomly selected colonies and digested with HgiAI to confirm that the joining reaction had occurred correctly ( Hesse et al .
1987 ) .
In all cases , the expected products were recovered .
PCR assay of « rearrangements A modification of the PCR method of Schlissel and Baltimore ( 1989 ) was used .
The 50-ul reactions contained 2 pl of template DNA { either cell lysate from 1x 10* cells or 0.5 ug of genomic DNA ) ; 200 um each of TTP , dATP , dGTP , and dCTP ; 2.5 ram MgC ) ; , 100 ug/ml !
of gelatin , 50 mm KCl , 10 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 8.3 at 25°C ) , 0.2 um of each primer , and 1 unit of Taq polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus ) .
The Vx primer was 5-GGC-TGCAGG/CTTCAGTGGCAGTGGGTC-3 ' ; the 3 ' primer , derived from J « 5 and /k5-Cx intron sequences was 5-CCA-AGCTTGTACTTACGTTTCAGCT-3 ' .
Amplifications were performed using a Programmable Thermal Controller ( MJ Re-search , Inc. ) for 28 cycles of 1 min at 94°C , 1.5 min at 50°C , and 1.5 min at 72°C .
After the last cycle , the samples were incubated for 5 min at 72°C .
A 10-pul sample of each reaction was fractionated through 2 % agarose gels and blotted to Nytran membranes .
The membranes were hybridized to a P-labeled probe containing the 2.8-kb HindIII insert from /x1-5 { Selsing et al .
1984 ) or a probe containing only the Jk5 region .
