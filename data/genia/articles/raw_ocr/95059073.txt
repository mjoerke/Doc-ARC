12 A Factor That Regulates the Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Gene DPA Is a Member of a Subfamily of Zinc Finger Proteins That Includes a Drosophila Developmental Control Protein MINORU SUGAWARA , t THOMAS SCHOLL , PAUL D. PONATH , anp JACK L. STROMINGER* Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , Harvard University , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02138 Received 31 March 1994/Returned for modification 18 July 1994/Accepted 6 September 1994 A novel DNA sequence element termed the J element involved in the regulated expression of class II major histocompatibility complex genes was recently described .
To study this element and its role in class II gene regulation further , a cDNA library was screened with oligonucleotide probes containing both the S element and the nearby J element of the human DPA gene .
Several DNA clones were obtained by this procedure , one of which , clone 18 , is reported and characterized here .
It encodes a protein predicted to contain 688 amino acid residues , including 11 zinc finger motifs of the C , H , type in the C-terminal region , that are Kriippel-like in the conservation of the H/C link sequence connecting them .
The 160 N-terminal amino acids in the nonfinger region of clone 18 are highly homologous with similar regions of several other human , mouse , and Drosophile sequences , defining a subfamily of Kriippel-like zinc finger proteins termed TAB ( framtrack [ ttk ] -associated box ) here .
One of the Drosophila sequences , ttk , is a developmental control gene , while a second does not contain a zinc finger region but encodes a structure important in oocyte development .
An acidic activation domain is located between the N-terminal conserved region of clone 18 and its zinc fingers .
This protein appears to require both the S and J elements , which are separated by 10 bp for optimal binding .
Antisense cDNA to clone 18 inhibited the expression of a reporter construct containing the DPA promoter , indicating its functional importance in the expression of this class II gene .
The class II molecules of the human major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) mediate communication between antigen-presenting cells and helper T cells during an immune response ( 6 ) ; i.e. , they present peptides derived from protein processing to the T-cell receptor complex ( 9 ) .
Genes encoding human class II MHC proteins are closely linked on the short arm of chromosome 6 ( 33 ) .
The molecules that they encode are heterodimeric glycoproteins and are expressed on the surfaces of B cells , activated T cells , and macrophages ( 31 , 37 ) .
Gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) induces the expression of class II molecules in most cell types , thereby allowing these cells to participate in the immune response ( 16 , 49 ) .
Since expression of class II a-and B-chain genes is determined by cell lineage and influenced by differentiation state and exogenous stimuli ( i.e. , lympho-kines ) , the mechanisms by which these genes are controlled are likely to be complex .
They involve a variety of regulatory molecules that interact with these genes and determine their rates of transcription .
The class II gene family has been intensively studied both for its immunological interest and for understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate class II gene expression .
Many cis regulatory elements have been identified for the class II MHC genes , primarily through identification of DNA elements conserved in sequence and position in the proximal promoter and their examination by transient transfection of promoter-re-porter gene constructs into various cell types .
Regulatory elements have been identified both in the promoter regions and elsewhere in the genes ( 7 , 22 ) .

8438 of a number of DNA-binding proteins that could be involved in the regulation of class II gene expression is the focus of much current work in this field .
Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is mediated , at least in part , by the specific interaction between trans-acting nuclear proteins and regulatory cis-acting DNA sequences .
The most prevalent DNA-binding motif , the zinc finger found in many eukaryotic transcription regulatory proteins , was initially identified in the Xeropus RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIA ( 10 , 44 ) .
In the basic structural unit of a zinc finger , pairs of Cys and His residues bind a Zn ( II ) ion .
The four conserved Cys and His residues build a metal-binding core , and the sequences between these residues are folded into finger-like structures that make contact with nucleic acids ( 44 , 48 ) .
Similar motifs homologous to the fingers in TFIIIA were subsequently identified in other genes , including Drosophila ( 54 , 64 , 67 ) , yeast ( 25 ) , Xenopus ( 55 ) , and mammalian ( 12 , 15 , 30 , 47 ) regulatory genes .
The fingers in these proteins have a consensus sequence , Cys-X , -Cys-X , -Phe-X , -Leu-X , -His-X , or X , -His ( where X 's represent variable amino acids ) , referred to as a Cys/His or C , H , motif , respectively .
This finger motif has been found in a number of proteins with key developmental regulatory functions , e.g. , Drosophila Kriippel ( 54 ) and hunchback ( 64 ) zinc finger proteins involved in embryonic pattern formation .
In addition , the tandemly repeated finger units in many members of this family are separated by a stretch of seven amino acids connecting the final histidine of one finger to the first cysteine of the next finger , ( the H/C link , Isolation and comparison of cDNAs encoding potential finger proteins indicate that in addition to the C , H , ; type , other finger proteins , including the C , H , C , , and C ; , types , contain a variable number of conserved cysteines in appropriate positions for metal chelation ( 32 ) .
Vou .
14 , 1994 The biological function of the majority of zinc finger proteins , mostly isolated on the basis of sequence homology in the zinc finger region , is not clear .
The number of family members was estimated at more than 300 in human cells ( 17 ) , and similar high numbers have been suggested to exist in Xenopus ( 38 ) and mouse ( 15 ) cells .
Some small subfamilies of structurally related zinc finger proteins have been defined on the basis of a highly conserved region N terminal to , but outside of , the finger domains .
Such conserved N-terminal structural domains include FAX ( finger-associated box ) ( 36 ) domains found in a large number of Xenopus zinc finger proteins and evolutionarily conserved KRAB ( Kriippel-associated box ) ( 5 ) and FPB ( finger-preceding box ) ( 53 ) domains identified in human , mouse , and Xenopus zinc finger proteins .
The function of these conserved regions is unknown .
Here the isolation and characterization of a novel human cDNA , clone 18 , encoding a multi-zinc finger protein containing the C , H , motif is reported .
This clone was obtained from a human B-cell cDNA expression library by probing with oligonucleotides containing the S and J elements of the proximal promoter of a class II MHC gene , DPA .
Clone 18 is classified as Kriippel-like on the basis of the fact that it shares typical Kriippel features , namely , the structure of the finger motif as well as the H/C link connecting successive finger repeats .
The finger motifs of the Krtippel type in clone 18 are located toward its middle and C-terminal regions .
It also has a highly conserved amino acid module located at the N terminus that defines a subfamily of zinc finger genes , referred to as TAB ( tramtrack [ fik ] associated box ) and an acidic activation domain located between the TAB and zinc finger regions .
Antisense experiments confirmed the importance of this protein in regulation of the DPA gene .
The unusual feature that DNA binding requires both sequence elements , S and J , is also reported .

Library screening and DNA sequencing .
A Agtll cDNA MHC CLASS II ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 8439 library , constructed from poly ( A ) * RNA prepared from the human B-cell line RPMI 4265 , was purchased ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif. ) .
This library was screened by the methods of Singh et al .
( 59 ) and Vinson et al .
( 68 ) , using a mixture of five-times-concatenated S and J elements of the DPA promoter ( positions -124 to -98 ) , four-times-concatenated J and S elements of the DQB promoter ( positions -146 to -131 ) , and the BamHI fragment of pDPA/107 ( positions -107 to -11 of the DPA promoter ) .
All DNA sequences were determined for both strands of fragments inserted into pBluescript SK ( Strat-agene , La Jolla , Calif. ) by the dideoxy-chain termination method .
Preparation of poly ( A ) * RNA for Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis .
Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method , and mRNA was prepared by two rounds of poly ( A ) selection .
Five micrograms of poly ( A ) * RNA was subjected to 1.0 % formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon filter with 10 % SSC ( 1 % SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate ) .
The filter was baked at 80°C with vacuum for 2 h and prehybridized at 42°C for 4 h in 5 % SSC-1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -0.5 mg of depurinated salmon sperm DNA per ml-10X Denhardt 's solution ( 1 % Denhardt 's solution is 0.02 % bovine serum albumin , 0.02 % Ficoll , and 0.02 % polyvinylpyrrolidone ) .
The filter was hybridized at 42°C for 12 to 18 h in 5 % SSC-50 % formamide-1 % SDS-100 ug of depurinated salmon sperm DNA per ml-1x Denhardt 's solution-10 % dextran sulfate-2 x 10° cpm of 3°P-radiolabeled 400-bp EcoRI-Bg/lI fragment of clone 18a-6 cDNA per ml .
The filter was washed three times at room temperature in 1 % SSC-0.5 % SDS and then three times in 0.1 % SSC-0.5 % SDS at 42°C .
Filters were exposed to X-ray film with intensifying screens at -70°C .
Preparation of high-molecular-weight DNA and Southern blot analysis .
High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated from the human cell line Raji and mouse liver tissues by sarcosyl disruption of the cell membranes followed by three phenol and two phenol-chloroform extractions .
Purified DNA was dia-lyzed against four changes of 10 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) -1 mM EDTA .
Fifteen micrograms of high-molecular-weight DNA was digested overnight with fivefold-excess restriction endonu-clease .
The cleaved DNA was then separated on 0.7 % agarose gels in 1 X TBE ( 89 mM Tris , 89 mM boric acid , 0.2 mM EDTA [ pH 8.0 ] ) buffer .
After visualization on a UV transilluminator , the gels were denatured , neutralized , transferred to nylon membranes , and probed with a radiolabeled 400-bp EcoRI-Bgil fragment of clone 18a-6 cDNA .
The filter was washed at high stringency ( 0.2 % SSC-0.5 % SDS , 65°C ) and autoradio-graphed .
Plasmid constructs .
The class II promoters were fused to either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) or hGH as a reporter gene ; the plasmids used , pDRA/1028CAT ( 4 ) , pDQB/ 160CAT ( 57 ) , and pDPA/148hGH ( 71 ) , were described previ-ously .
Mammalian cell expression constructs producing sense and antisense clone 18 transcripts were made by inserting the entire clone 18 cDNA ( designated 5'-3 ' ) , the 5 EcoRI-to-Xhol fragment ( 5 ' ) , or the 3 ' Bg/lI fragment ( 3 ' ) into the HindIII-Xbal site of pRc/RSV ( Invitrogen , San Diego , Calif. ) .
The various 3 ' truncations of the clone 18 cDNAs were cloned into the PstI or EcoRI site of pBXG1 immediately downstream of and in frame to a gene encoding the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 ( amino acids 1 to 147 ) under the control of the simian virus 40 enhancer/promoter .

DNA transfection and reporter gene assay .
Transfection of HeLa or Me9229/18 cell lines was performed by the calcium phosphate method as described previously ( 13 ) .
Briefly , 10 ug of plasmid expressing either antisense or sense clone 18 cDNA in the pRc/RSV vector was cotransfected with 2.5 pug of pDRA/1028CAT , 6.0 ug of pDQB/160CAT , or 5.0 ug of pDPA/148hGH into 2 x 10° HeLa or Me9229/18 cells .
After 12 h of incubation with the calcium phosphate-DNA precipi-tate , cells were washed twice in serum-free medium and twice in serum-containing medium and then incubated for 48 h for HeLa cells or 72 h for Me9229/18 cells in the presence or absence of IFN-y at a concentration of 500 or 800 U/ml , respectively .
Raji cells were transfected by electroporation in phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mM N-2-hydroxyeth-ylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ; pH 7.4 ) .
Briefly , 5 X 10° cells in a 250-pl volume were mixed with the same amounts of recombinant plasmid as used above , incubated on ice for 10 min , pulsed at 250 V and 960 mF , and allowed to stand on ice for 10 min .
The cells were transferred to 5 ml of RPMI 1640 plus 10 % fetal calf serum for 48 h. Transfections also included 2 pug of either pTKhGH ( Nichols Institute ) or pRSVCAT ( 13 ) as an internal control to normalize for small differences in transfection efficiencies ( < 15 % ) for CAT or hGH reporter constructs , respectively .
Approximately 48 h following transfection , the supernatant and cells were harvested by centrifugation and assayed for hGH activity and CAT activity essentially as described previously ( 13 , 57 , 58 , 61 , 71 ) .

RESULTS Cloning , nucleotide sequence , and predicted amino acid sequence of clone 18 .
The direct isolation of cDNA clones encoding sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins from Agt11 expression libraries by using *°P-labeled double-stranded DNA probes containing the binding site for the protein of interest has been described elsewhere ( 59 , 68 ) .
Concatenation of the probe to increase binding stability and processing the filters through a guanidine hydrochloride denaturation-renaturation step prior to screening greatly improve the sensitivity .
There-fore , a human Agtll B-cell cDNA expression library was screened by using a mixture of concatenated duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to the S and J elements in the promoters of the DPA and DQB genes ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Screening of 8 x 10° recombinant phage plaques yielded three independent positive clones containing 0.95- , 1.05- , and 1.80-kb inserts , designated clones 18 , 25 , and 28 , respectively .
The proteins encoded by each of these clones in lysogens bound double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the promoter of the DPA gene .
However , their sequences and binding specificities were clearly different .
No clones were obtained by probing with oligonucleotides containing a mul-timerized S ( 7-bp ) or J ( 10-bp ) element alone .
One well-characterized clone , clone 18 , which encodes a zinc finger protein that binds to the DPA promoter , is reported here .
The initially isolated cDNA ( clone 18a-6 ) was 0.95 kb in length and contained a poly ( A ) * tail .
The EcoRI-Bgll fragment ( 400 bp ) from its 5° end was used to rescreen the same library .
A nearly full-length cDNA of 2.3 kb ( clone 18a-1 ) , missing 50 bp from the 3 ' end that were present in the original clone ( clone 18a-6 ) , was obtained ( see Fig .
9A ) .
The composite nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length 2,345-bp transcript are shown in Fig .
1 .
The 11 zinc finger motifs of the C , H , ; type present in clone 18 ( Fig .
1 and 2 ) are located through the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein , as is typical of finger proteins .
The open reading frame starts with an ATG at nucleotides 163 to 165 and ends with a TAG stop codon at nucleotides 2227 to 2229 .
The 119-bp 3 ' untranslated region contains a canonical polyadenylation signal ( AATAAA ) at nucleotides 2269 to 2274 upstream

Zinc finger motifs of clone 18 .
Homology within clone 18 to a prototypic C ; H , zinc finger ( C-X ; -C-X ; -F-X , -L-X , -H-X , or X , -H , where X 's represent variable amino acids ) is shown .
Boldface letters indicate clone 18 amino acid residues which match the consensus sequence .
Cysteine and histidine residues which hypothetically coordinate Zn** are boxed .
Homology of clone 18 with the seven amino acids in the H/C link of the Kriippel family ( the H/C link , TGEKP [ Y/F } JX ) are underlined .
Note that the second finger is atypical in that it is of the C ; H type , contains a Y instead of the conserved F , and has a nonhomologous C/C link of nine residues .
from the poly ( A ) * tail .
The ATG at nucleotides 163 to 165 is presumably the translation initiation codon because it is the first ATG in the sequence , is preceded at nucleotides 25 to 27 by an in-frame TAG stop codon , and is surrounded by sequences which are in good agreement with the consensus ( CC [ G/AICCATGG ) for eukaryotic initiation of translation ( 39 , 40 ) .
The reading frame opened by the ATG at positions 163 to 165 would code for a polypeptide of 688 amino acids with a calculated relative molecular weight of 77,015 .
A comparison of the clone 18 cDNA nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with those of other genes indicated high similarity to the zinc finger regions and the H/C link of the Drosophila developmental control gene Kriippel ( Fig .
2 ) , a gene regulating thoracic and abdominal segmentation at the blastoderm-gastrulation stage .
Moreover , its internally repetitious sequences of zinc finger domains were homologous to those of TFIIIA ( 10 , 44 , 54 ) and another developmentally regulated Xenopus gene ( 20 ) .
Eleven such zinc finger repeat units containing cysteine , histidine , and hydrophobic residues in the appropriate combination and spacing to fit with the consensus sequence ( 44 ) are present in clone 18 ( Fig .
2 ) , and alignment of the 11 finger motifs clearly shows conservation or consensus finger residues ( boldface in Fig .
2 ) and homologies with the H/C link , TGEKP ( Y/F ) X ( underlined in Fig .
2 ) .
According to the crystal structure analysis of a zinc finger protein-DNA complex ( 48 ) , the crucial amino acid residues that specify the recognition of the target DNA sequences are located within the loop between Cys-4 and His-17 .

Northern blot analysis .
Northern blot analysis was performed on RNA isolated from various cell lines .
Poly ( A ) * RNA ( 10 ug per lane ) from four cell lines ( Raji [ B cell } , Jurkat [ T celll , U937 [ macrophage { M } ] , and MG-63 [ osteosarcoma ] ) was probed with a radiolabeled clone 18 cDNA .
The same filter was probed with the y-actin to control for the amount of RNA applied to each lane .
Members of the Kriippel family , defined by the H/C link sequence and the zinc finger unit , can be divided into some subfamilies based on homologies within the N-terminal regions as well as some individual sequences which can not be grouped .
Two such subfamilies , FAX ( 36 ) and KRAB ( 5 ) ( or FPB [ 53 ] , which appears to be similar ) , have been described .
The amino-terminal sequence of clone 18 does not correspond to either of these subfamilies .
Rather , it helps to define a subfamily , here termed TAB , of which there are at least eight other members ( Fig .
3 ) .
Four of these are human genes of unknown function with deduced amino acid sequences showing strong homology to the N-terminal region of clone 18 .
The human KUP ( 11 ) and LAZ-3 ( 34 ) genes encode putative zinc finger proteins whose messages are highly expressed in hematopoietic and muscle tissue , respectively .
PLZF ( 14 ) protein is involved in chromosomal translocations in human promyelocytic leukemia .
Strong homology to both clone 18 and KUP was also identified in an expressed sequence tag derived by random sequencing of inserts from a human brain cDNA library ; little is known about this gene ( 1 , 2 ) .
The closest homology to the clone 18 N-terminal region occurs in the mouse ZF5 gene , an apparent zinc finger factor with transcriptional repressor activity ( 45 ) .
Interestingly , the N-terminal region of clone 18 shares homology with three genes involved in Drosophila development .
One of them , tk , encodes a zinc finger protein implicated in segmentation and eye formation ( 25 , 69 ) .
The second is the BR-C ( Broad-complex ) gene , which is required for Drosophila metamorphosis and whose function in transcriptional activity is not known ( 19 ) .
Furthermore , homology was found to the Drosophila gene Keilch , which appears to encode a structural component of ring canals , important in oocyte development , that is not a zinc finger protein ( 70 ) .

Southern blot analysis .
For genomic Southern blots of high-molecular-weight DNA isolated from the cell line Raji and mouse liver tissues , 15 pug of genomic DNA was cleaved by overnight digestion with the indicated restriction endonucleases .
a protein domain conserved between such divergent proteins as Keich and a series of zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factors is unclear .
One possibility might be a function in protein-protein interactions .
The TAB also shares homology with viral proteins , e.g. , example , vaccinia virus open reading frame proteins A55 ( 23 ) and SalF21R ( 27 ) , and myxoma virus proteins M9-R and M-T8 ( 65 ) , none of which appear to be zinc finger proteins .
The functions of these viral proteins are unknown .
Northern and Southern blot analyses .
To determine the sizes and the distribution of clone 18 transcripts , a Northern blot of poly ( A ) * RNA from various tissue culture cell lines was probed with the 0.4-kb EcoRI-BglI fragment of clone 18a-6 ( Fig .
4 ) .
High levels of clone 18 mRNA , a band corresponding to a length of 2.2 to 2.4 kb , were detected in lymphoid cell lines , i.e. , Raji ( B cell ) , Jurkat ( T cell ) , and U937 ( macrophage ) , but a considerably lower level was found in a nonlymphoid cell line , MG-63 ( osteosarcoma ) .
Rehybridization of Northern blots to the y-actin probe revealed that comparable amounts of RNA were loaded in all lanes .
Additional Northern analysis by using MTN ( multiple tissue Northern ) Blot II ( Clontech ) detected clone 18 message transcribed in a variety of human tissues , including thymus , testis , spleen , small intestine , pros-tate , ovary , leukocyte ( peripheral blood ) , and colon ( data not shown ) .
From this result , clone 18 appears to be ubiquitously transcribed .
Southern blot analysis ( Fig .
5 ) using human Raji cell genomic DNA cut with several restriction enzymes revealed one major fragment with EcoRI or HindIII and two small fragments with BamHI .
The cDNA sequence has no EcoRI or BamHI sites but contains a single HindIII site .
By contrast , a single faintly hybridizing band at 0.7 kb was detected after cutting with Psfl .
The cDNA contains eight PstI sites .

Expression and purification of bacterially expressed proteins .
The 0.95-kb cDNA clone that includes a poly ( A ) * tail has been expressed in E. coli and purified ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Figure 6 shows the kinetics of clone 18a-6 protein expression after stimulation with 1 mM IPTG and the quality of the nickel column-purified preparation .
All samples were analyzed by reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( 9 % gel ) and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 .
The final yield of the clone 18a-6 protein ( 33 kDa ) was about 2 mg/liter .
The binding activity of this recombinant protein was examined not only by electrophoretic mobility shift assay but also by DNase I footprinting .
Attempts to refold the full-length recombinant clone 18 , which contains 11 zinc fingers , have so far been unsuccessful ( data not shown ) .
Binding specificity .
Clone 18a-6 was plated on E. coli Y1090 cells , induced with IPTG , transferred to nitrocellulose , denatured , and renatured .
The filter was sectored into thirds , which were probed with oligonucleotides containing either the S and J elements of DPA ( nucleotides -124 to -98 ) , the J and S elements of DQB ( nucleotides -146 to -131 ) , or the J , X , and Y elements of DPA ( corresponding to nucleotides -107 to -11 of the DPA promoter ) .
Note that the J and S elements have different relative positions in these probes : DPA , S at -124 to -118 and J at -107 to -98 ; and DQB , J at -146 to -137 and S at -137 to -131 .
Only the S and J oligonucleotides of DPA bound to the lysogen ( Fig .
7A ) , suggesting that this zinc finger protein may be specific for the S and J elements of the DPA gene .
The weak binding of clone 18 to J-X-Y of DPA ( nucleotides -107 to -11 ) is compatible with other data ( see below ) indicating that binding of some proteins to the J element of DPA is greatly enhanced by the S element .
The binding activity expressed by this clone was also exam Mor .

ined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a lysate prepared from the phage lysogen ( Fig .
7B ) .
One prominent band that was readily competed for by the S and J oligonucleotides of DPA was detected , suggesting that this complex is the result of sequence-specific protein binding ( Fig .
7B , lanes 2 and 5 ) .
However , it was competed for only minimally by either the S or J element of DPA alone ( Fig .
7B , lanes 3 and 4 , confirming the specificity observed above ) and not at all by the polylinker sequence of pUC18 ( Fig .
7B , lane 6 ) .
Moreover , it was not competed for by the J and S oligonucleotide of DQB ( Fig .
7B , lane 7 ) or by the J-X-Y oligonucleotide of the DPA promoter ( data not shown ) .
This complex was not seen in equivalent lysates from the uninfected E. coli host strain , Y1089r - .
A more extensive electrophoretic mobility shift assay with cold competition experiments was done with Ni-NTA column-purified recombinant clone 18a-6 protein ( Fig .
6 , 7C , and 7D ) .
In addition to the major band , several weaker bands were detected .
All of these bands result from recombinant protein .
They may represent different conformations , modifications , or degradation products .
The relative binding affinity of the recombinant protein for the J and S elements of the DPA promoter was analyzed by competition experiments .
The recombinant clone 18a-6 protein was incubated with the *°P-labeled S and J elements in the presence of different amounts of unlabeled S , J , or S and J elements as competitor oligonucleotides , and the extent of competition was analyzed by PAGE ( Fig .
7C ) .
The major band was competed for efficiently by S and J elements even at a 10-fold molar excess of competitor ( Fig .
7C , lane 3 ) , poorly by the J element alone even at a high molar excess of competitor ( Fig .
7C , lane 13 , 160-fold molar excess ) , and at an intermediate efficiency by the S element alone ( Fig .
7C , lane 8 , 40-fold molar excess ) .
Competition with the pUC18 polylinker had no effect on binding of the recombinant clone 18a-6 protein .
Further tests of the DNA sequence recognition specificity of clone 18a-6 protein were carried out by a cold competition electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a 50-fold molar excess of various oligonucleotides ( Fig .
7D ) .
The oligonucleotides for the S , J , and S plus J elements of DPA and the BamHI fragment of pDPA/148 ( corresponding to nucleotides -148 to -11 of the DPA promoter ) effectively decreased formation of this band ( Fig .
7D , lanes 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 ) .
In contrast , no or minimal inhibition was seen with J and S elements of DQB , Oct-1 , AP-1 , and SP-1 double-stranded oligonucleotides , with the Alul-BamHI fragment of the DPA promoter ( nucleotides -81 to -11 ) and the Alul-HindIIHI fragment of the DQB promoter ( nucleotides -88 to +39 ) , both of which include the Y box , or with the HindIII fragment of pDQB/160 ( nucleotides -160 to +39 of the DQB promoter , the entire proximal promoter , including both the S and J elements ) , Xbal-EcoRI fragment of pDRA/300 ( nucleotides -267 to +33 , the entire promoter , also including both elements ) , and EcoRI-HindIlII polycloning site fragment of pUC18 ( Fig .
7D , lanes 6 and 8 to 15 , 100-fold molar excess ) .
The specificity for the S and J elements of DPA is notable since the corresponding elements of DQB and DRA each differ by only one or two nucleotides from those found in consensus sequences ( 61 ) .
The A at position 4 of the J element is conserved in all three sequences ; this nucleotide has previously been shown to be critical both for promoter activity with a reporter gene ( CAT or hGH ) and in binding of a J-element-specific complex ( 61 , 62 ) .
To define more precisely the DNA segments recognized by this zinc finger protein , footprinting was performed with both lysogen and recombinant clone 18a-6 protein .

A filter bearing expressed clone 18 in the original Agtll isolate ( 18a-6 ) was processed as described in Materials and Methods and divided into thirds .
Binding to the indicated probes was tested .

Shown is gel shift analysis of extracts prepared either from clone 18a-6 lysogens ( B ) or from Ni-NTA column-purified recombinant protein ( C and D ) , using S and J elements of the DPA promoter ( nucleotides -124 to ~98 ) as the probe .
Lanes include no extract ( free ) , no competitor ( - ) , or a 10- to 640-fold molar excess of cold competitor , either double-stranded oligonucleotides or purified fragments as indi-cated .
The EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pUC18 was also tested ( poly-linker ) .
One microgram of recombinant protein or 5 jg of lysogen was preincubated with 3.0 pug of poly ( dI-dC ) -poly ( dI-dC ) as nonspecific competitor DNA and the amount of specific competitor DNA ( molar excess ) indicated above each well for 5 min on ice before addition of the labeled probe and the remaining components .
After preincubation , the probe was added to the binding reaction mixture .

A DNase I footprint , using either 5 and 10 pg of lysogen ( E ) or 1 , 3 , and 10 ug of recombinant protein 18a-6 ( F ) as indicated , was obtained on the DPA promoter fragment ( -148 to -11 bp ) .
Additional lanes include controls for no extract ( free ) and chemical cleavage at guanidine ( G ) , guanidine and adenine ( G+A ) , or cytosine and thymidine ( C+T ) .
These Maxam and Gilbert scissions were used to map the protected region .
Brackets indicate the positions of conserved MHC class II promoter elements .

Regulation of class II reporter gene expression by antisense RNA .
A functional role for clone 18 in class II transcription was assessed by limiting clone 18 expression with antisense RNAs .
Plasmids directing the synthesis of clone 18 RNAs were constructed by inserting three different fragments of the clone 18 cDNA ( the full length , the 5 ' end , and the 3 ' end ) , oriented to produce both sense and antisense transcripts , into a Rous sarcoma virus-derived mammalian expression vector ( pRe/ RSV ; Invitrogen ) ( Fig .

Effects on MHC class II reporter activities by antisense clone 18 RNA .
( A ) Clone 18 expression constructions .
Regions of clone 18 cDNA inserted into pRe/RSV to produce sense ( s ) and antisense ( as ) transcripts include 18a-6 fragments EcoRI ( 5'-3 ' ) , EcoRI to Xhol ( 5 ' ) , and Bgil ( 3 ' ) .
( B ) Reporter gene assays .
Ten micrograms of either antisense or sense clone 18 plasmid was cotransfected with 2.5 pug of pDRA/10O28CAT , 6.0 ug of pDQB/160CAT , or 5.0 jg of pDPA/148hGH into either HeLa or Me9229/18 cells in the presence and absence of IFN-y ( 500 or 800 U/ml , respectively ) and into Raji cells .
Approximately 48 h following transfection , the supernatant and cells were harvested by centrifugation and assayed for hGH activity and CAT activity essentially as described previously ( 4 , 57 , 71 ) .
The standard error of the mean was less than 15 % .
RNAs on clone 18 protein expression was used to investigate the role of clone 18 in transcription from class II promoters in vivo .
Cotransfection of antisense or sense clone 18 and the MHC class II promoter ( DRA , DQB , and DPA ) constructs , fused to CAT or hGH as a reporter gene , into Raji or IFN-y-treated HeLa and Me9229/18 cells was examined .
Ten micrograms of either antisense or sense clone 18 vector was cotransfected with 2.5 ug of pDRA/1028CAT , 6.0 mg of pDQB/160CAT , or 5.0 ug of pDPA/148hGH into either HeLa or Me9229/18 cells in the presence and absence of IFN-y and into Raji cells .
In transfectants , the induction of the DPA promoter by IFN-y in HeLa cells was about 50 to 60 % inhibited by antisense ( but not by sense ) constructs , either full length or containing the 5 ' end of the cDNA , but not by that containing the 3 ' end ( Fig .
8B ) .
However , no significant inhibition of the expression of the DPA promoter activity could be detected in Raji B cells , which express class II genes constitutively .
This result is similar to the finding that antisense expression of hXBP-1 , a b-ZIP protein which binds to the DRA promoter , could strongly inhibit IFN-y-induced but not constitutive DRA promoter activity in a similar assay ( 46 ) .
Furthermore , antisense clone 18 inhibited expression neither of DRA in IFN-y-induced HeLa cells or in Raji cells nor of DQB in IFN-y-induced Me9229/18 cells or in Raji cells .
Analysis of the acidic activation domain of clone 18 .
To identify a transcriptional activation domain , several C- and an N-terminally truncated clone 18 proteins fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 ( amino acids 1 to 147 ) were expressed from the vector pBXG1 under the control of the simian virus 40 enhancer/promoter ( Fig .
9A ) .
The ability of each of these fusion proteins to activate a GALA site-bearing promoter in transient transfection assays was analyzed ( Fig .
9B ) .
The positive control plasmid , pBXGALA-VP16 , contains one copy of the activation domain of VP16 ( amino acids 413 to 454 ) fused to the DNA-binding domain of GALA ( amino acids 1 to 147 ) .
CAT assays were performed on Raji cell lysates 48 h after cotransfection of reporter and effector plasmids .
An autoradiogram of a typical assay is shown .
The full-length GAL4-clone 18 fusion protein ( nucleotides 163 to 2226 , amino acids 1 to 688 ) is only slightly active in this type of assay ( Fig .
9B , lane 5 ) .
However , progressive C-terminal truncations revealed that a strong clone 18 activation domain lies within amino acids 1 to 444 ( nucleotides 163 to 1497 ) ( lane 6 ) .
Minimal activation was also seen with the segment encoding amino acids 1 to 195 ( nucleotides 163 to 749 ) ( lane 7 ) , and no activation was found with the segment containing amino acids 1 to 126 ( nucleotides 163 to 539 ) ( lane 8 ) or with the C-terminal segment from amino acids 411 to 688 ( nucleotides 1393 to 2226 ) ( lane 9 ) .
Acidic regions lie between amino acids VoL .

Thus , the latter acidic region is required for strong activation .
This putative transcriptional activation domain is located between the conserved N-terminal region ( TAB ) and the finger region .
It is difficult , however , to define by this type of analysis an exact physiological activation domain because some random amino acid sequences containing a preponderance of acidic residues have been shown to be active in this assay ( 21 ) .
DISCUSSION The recent development of techniques for screening bacte-riophage expression libraries with double-stranded oligonucleotide probes led to the isolation of cDNAs for many putative transcription factors ( 59 , 68 ) .
Some of these factors , such as macrophage- and B-cell-specific PU-1 ( 35 ) , have tissue-specific expression , while others , e.g. , C/EBP ( 59 ) and H2TFI ( 68 ) , are more widely expressed .
Furthermore , expression cloning led to the isolation of the cDNAs encoding candidate MHC class II transcription factors ( 7 , 22 ) designated RF-X ( 18 , 43 , 51 , 52 ) and hXBP-1 ( 41 ) , both of which specifically bind sequences within the DRA promoter ( X , and X ; , boxes , respectively ) .
Here , the cloning of a novel class II transcription factor , clone 18 , that binds to the S and J elements of the DPA promoter is described .
Sequence analysis shows that clone 18 encodes 11 zinc fingers of the C , H , type .
The finger repeats are joined via an H/C link similar to the Kriippel-related developmental control genes in Drosophila melanogaster .
Generally , zinc finger repeats are located centrally or near the carboxy termini of polypeptides , and clone 18 is typical in this respect .
Sequence analysis has shown that , in addition to their zinc 8448 SUGARAWA ET AL .
fingers , some of these proteins have conserved domains near their amino termini .
These homologies have led to the designation of subfamilies of finger proteins such as those possessing FAX ( 36 ) or KRAB/FPB ( 5 , 53 ) boxes .
These domains are enriched in charged amino acids , as are other conserved modules found in developmental control genes such as the homeobox , the paired box ( 8 ) , and the POU domain ( 26 , 28 ) .
Within the FAX and KRAB/FPB boxes , two highly conserved regions have the potential for « -helical secondary structure .
This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions may function as transcriptional activators as a result of the proposed « -helical nature of some characterized activation domains ( 50 ) .
Notably , two very recent reports now suggest that some acidic activation domains contain B-sheet rather than -helical secondary structure ( 42 , 66 ) .
In the present study , the first 160 amino acids of clone 18 show striking homology to at least eight other proteins in the sequence database , including proteins encoded by human , mouse , and Drosophila genes ( Fig .
3 ) .
One of the Drosophila genes is important in developmental control .
The region of N-terminal homology among them also shares homology with some viral proteins ( 23 , 27 , 65 ) .
These structural homologies suggest that clone 18 may function as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates tissue differentiation .
Whether clone 18 is involved in activation of the DP locus during B-cell development is an intriguing question .
It seemed plausible that this conserved N-terminal region might code for transcriptional activator function when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain .
However , no activation was associated with the conserved amino acids 1 to 125 in the N-terminal region of clone 18 .
Activation was only slightly potentiated in a fusion construct including a longer segment of clone 18 , amino acids 1 to 195 , that include the entire conserved region .
However , it was strongly potentiated when amino acids 1 to 444 were present .
Interestingly , a fusion construct containing the entire clone 18 coding region induced much less activation than the 1-444 construct .
The DNA-binding domain of clone 18 may have interfered with or competed against recognition by the fusion protein of the GALA DNA-binding site on the reporter construct .
The strong transcriptional activation resulting from clone 18 segment 1-444 may be due to a highly acidic region of clone 18 located at amino acids 216 to 254 between the conserved N-terminal box and the zinc fingers .
A function for the conserved N-terminal region remains enigmatic , but it could serve as a region for interactions with other transcription factors ( e.g. , piggyback proteins ) .
While the mechanism by which clone 18 affects transcription is uncertain , its role in specific MHC class II regulation is more clear .
Clone 18 shows strong specific binding to the nucleotide sequences in the DPA promoter .
This binding was localized to two conserved cis elements ( S and J ) which are required for maximum promoter activity of DPA .
A functional role for clone 18 in IFN-y-induced DPA regulation was strongly supported by the findings showing that antisense clone 18 expression suppressed transcription from the DPA promoter .
Transcription from other class II promoters was unaffected and corroborates the data on promoter binding specificity .
Moreover , the DNA binding , footprinting , and functional data all indicate that the S and J elements are both required for interaction with this protein , although they are separated by 10 bp in the DPA promoter .
Further studies are required to clarify the nature of this interaction .
Finally , the Southern blots indicate that the mouse genome , which has no counterpart for DPA , encodes a homologous single-copy gene .
Conservation within the N-terminal region of clone 18 does not explain this result since the probe used did Mor .

not contain this sequence .
A role of the murine homolog in class II gene expression is being sought .
Further experiments on the role of clone 18 in vivo would be facilitated by the production of full-length refolded protein and of specific antibodies and their use in the analysis of expression in tissue sections , cellular localization during development , and coprecipitation of ancillary factors .
However , attempts to produce the full-length refolded recombinant clone 18 in bacteria both to serve as an antigen and for structural studies have so far been unsuccessful and may be attributable to problems associated with the correct folding of a protein containing 11 zinc fingers .
