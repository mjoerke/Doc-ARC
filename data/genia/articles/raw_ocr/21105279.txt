Epstein-Barr Virus Immediate-Early Protein BZLF1 Is SUMO-1 Modified and Disrupts Promyelocytic Leukemia Bodies AMY L. ADAMSON ' f anp SHANNON KENNEY** Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ' and Departments of Medicine and Microbiology , '' University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599-7295 Received 3 July 2000/Accepted 17 November 2000 Although the immediate-early proteins of both herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) are known to modify promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) ( ND10 ) bodies in the nucleus of the host cell , it has been unclear whether lytic infection with gamma herpesviruses induces a similar effect .
The PML protein is induced by interferon , involved in major histocompatibility complex class I presentation , and necessary for certain types of apoptosis .
Therefore , it is likely that PML bodies function in an antiviral capacity .
SUMO-1 modification of PML is known to be required for the formation of PML bodies .
To examine whether Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic replication interferes with PML bodies , we expressed the EBV immediate-early genes BZLF1L ( Z ) and BRLF1 ( R ) in EBV-positive cell lines and examined PML localization .
Both Z and R expression resulted in PML dispersion in EBV-positive cells .
Z but not R expression is sufficient to disrupt PML bodies in EBV-negative cell lines .
We show that dispersion of PML bodies by Z requires a portion of the transcriptional activation domain of Z but not the DNA-binding function .
As was previously reported for the HSV-1 ICPO and CMV IE1 proteins , Z reduces the amount of SUMO-1-modified PML .
We also found that Z itself is SUMO-1 modified ( through amino acid 12 ) and that Z competes with PML for limiting amounts of SUMO-1 .
These results suggest that disruption of PML bodies is important for efficient lytic replication of EBV .
Furthermore , Z may potentially alter the function of a variety of cellular proteins by inhibiting SUMO-1 modification .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a member of the human herpesvirus family of viruses and infects approximately 90 % of the world 's population .
EBV is responsible for the clinical syndrome infectious mononucleosis ( 66 ) and is found in various tumors , including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt 's lymphoma ( 66 , 88 ) .
Upon infection of the host , EBV initially replicates within epithelial cells in the oropharynx ( 44 , 52 , 66 , 71 ) and subsequently infects B cells trafficking through the pharynx .
In B cells , the virus usually converts to a latent form and persists indefinitely in the host ( 44 , 52 , 66 , 71 ) .
During latency , only a small subset of EBV-encoded proteins are ex-pressed .
Occasionally , the latent virus within B cells switches back to the lytic mode of replication ( 66 ) .
Virus released from B cells then reinfects pharyngeal epithelial cells , resulting in the secretion of infectious virus into the saliva .
The first EBV genes expressed during the lytic form of viral replication are the immediate-early genes BZLF1 ( Z ) and BRLF1 ( R ) ( 44 ) .
The Z and R proteins function as transcriptional activators and induce expression of the next tier of EBV genes , the early genes ( 14 , 15 , 16 , 28 , 32 , 33 , 36 , 41 , 53 , 64 , 67 , 68 , 75 , 78 ) .
The early genes encode the viral proteins required for EBV DNA replication ( 44 ) .
Viral DNA replication is followed by EBV late-gene expression and packaging of the virus ( 44 ) .
Viruses often manipulate their host 's cellular environment * Corresponding author .

2388 in order to create favorable conditions for viral replication and survival .
Virally induced changes include modulation of host cell cycle progression , signal transduction cascades , and transcriptional functions , among others .
Notably , a number of vi-ruses , including herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , disperse nuclear structures known as promyelocytic leukemia ( PML , also called nuclear domain 10 [ ND10 ] ) bodies .
The viral proteins responsible for PML body dispersion in HSV-1 and CMV are the immediate-early proteins HSV-1 ICPO and CMV IE1 ( 3 , 4 , 23 , 40 , 46 , 57 ) .
Interestingly , ICPO mutants ( containing alterations within the RING finger ) which can not disperse PML bodies also fail to activate gene expression and can not replicate efficiently , suggesting a link between PML bodies and viral replication ( 21 ) .
PML-containing nuclear bodies are made up of several proteins , including CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) , Sp100 , Rb , Daxx , ISG20 , and the small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-1 ( 6 , 31 , 48 , 74 , 87 ) .
However , only the PML protein is known to be absolutely essential for the formation of these bodies ( 86 ) .
The PML protein was initially identified in patients with acute PML who harbored a translocation resulting in a fusion protein between the retinoic acid receptor « and PML protein ( 18 , 30 , 34 , 38 , 58 , 62 ) .
This RARa-PML fusion protein prevents PML protein from localizing in nuclear bodies ( 20 , 45 , 80 ) , which normally appear as 10 to 30 discrete dots ( depending upon cell type ) within the nucleus .
Treatment with retinoic acid leads to degradation of the RARa « -PML fusion protein , proper PML protein localization , and cancer remission ( 34 , 58 ) .
The wild-type PML protein is also involved in major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I presentation ( 85 ) and is required for certain types of apoptosis ( 10 , 24 , 37 , Vor .
75 , 2001 51 , 63 , 77 , 79 , 87 ) .
In addition , PML protein expression is induced by type I and II interferons ( 27 , 50 ) .
Therefore , it is likely that PML protein functions in an antiviral as well as antitumor capacity .
The PML protein was recently shown to be covalently modified by the SUMO-1 protein ( 8 , 60 , 72 ) .
SUMO-1 is an 11.5-kDa protein that is homologous to ubiquitin ( 8 , 39 , 49 , 54 , 56 , 70 ) ; however , SUMO-1 does not function in the same manner as ubiquitin .
SUMO-1 becomes covalently attached to a variety of proteins , including PML , RanGAP1 , and IxB , and serves to localize and/or stabilize these proteins ( 8 , 17 , 55 , 60 , 72 ) .
The SUMO-1 modification of PML protein is required for its localization to nuclear bodies ( 60 , 86 ) .
SUMO-1 modification of PML protein is also required for the localization of several other proteins , including Sp100 , Daxx , CBP , and ISG20 , into PML bodies ( 86 ) .
HSV-1 and CMV were both recently shown to disrupt PML bodies by inhibiting the formation of SUMO-1-modified species of PML protein ( 13 , 22 , 59 ) .
Interestingly , the CMV immediate-early protein IE1 ( as well as the IE2 protein ) is itself SUMO-1 modified ( 35 , 59 ) .
The ability of both alphaherpes-viruses ( HSV ) and betaherpesviruses ( CMV ) to disperse PML bodies in the host cell suggests that this function may be universally important for efficient herpesvirus replication , including gammaherpesviruses such as EBV .
However , to our knowledge the effect of lytic EBV infection on PML bodies has not been previously examined , probably due to the difficulty of inducing efficient lytic EBV infection in vitro .
In this study , we have examined the ability of lytic EBV infection to disperse PML bodies .
We show that induction of the lytic form of EBV infection using either expression vectors for Z or R or an adenovirus vector that expresses Z leads to dispersion of PML bodies in EBV-positive cells .
In EBV-negative cells , expression of the immediate-early protein Z alone but not R alone is sufficient to disperse PML bodies .
The dispersal of PML bodies is coincident with the loss of high-molecular-weight ( SUMO-1-modified ) isoforms of PML bodies .
In transfection assays , we show that the first 86 amino acids of Z ( which encode the transcriptional activation domain as well as a replication function ) are required for PML body dispersion .
We have also discovered that Z itself is SUMO-1 modified at amino acid 12 .
Additionally , we demonstrate that Z is able to outcompete PML bodies for SUMO-1 modification and that competition for SUMO-1 modification requires the lysine at amino acid 12 .
The disruption of PML bodies by all classes of herpesviruses suggests that this function is important for efficient lytic replication .

EBV lytic replication disrupts PML bodies .
EBV-positive cells ( D98/HE-R-1 ) were transfected with expression plasmids for either Z ( A and B ) or R ( C and D ) .
At 48 h posttransfection , cells were fixed and immunostained with either anti-Z ( monoclonal ) ( A ) , anti-R ( monoclonal ) ( C ) , or anti-PML protein ( polyclonal ) ( B and D ) antibodies .
Arrows indicate cells that are positively expressing Z or R. Cells were washed four times with 1 % TS-0.5 % BSA for 5 min each and then incubated in secondary antibody diluted in incubation mix for 45 min at 37°C ( goat anti-mouse Ig-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate [ 1:100 ] , from Sigma ; goat anti-rabbit Ig-indocarbocyanine conjugate [ 1:100 ] , from Jackson Labs ) .
Cells were washed as before , mounted in Anti-fade medium ( Molecular Probes ) , and viewed on a Zeiss Axioskop or Zeiss confocal microscope .
RESULTS Lytic EBV replication disperses PML bodies .
Expression of either the EBV Z or R immediate-early protein in EBV-positive cell lines is sufficient to trigger lytic EBV replication ( 14 , 15 , 43 , 65 , 67 , 68 , 75 , 81 , 82 ) .
To investigate whether lytic EBV replication induces disruption of PML bodies , we used expression vectors to express the Z and R proteins in the latently infected EBV-positive cell line D98/HE-R1 ( Fig .
1 ) .
In cells that are positively expressing Z ( Fig .
1A ) , there is a coincident dispersal of PML bodies ( Fig .
1B ) .
Expression of the other immediate-early protein , R , also induced relocalization of PML bodies in these EBV-positive cells ( Fig .
1C and D ) .
These experiments were repeated several times with similar results .
Therefore , lytic EBV replication induces dispersal of PML bodies .
Z but not R expression disperses PML bodies .
The two other herpesvirus family members known to disperse PML bodies , HSV-1 and CMV , do so via their immediate-early proteins ICPO and IE1 , respectively ( 3 , 23 , 40 , 46 , 57 ) .
To examine whether an EBV immediate-early protein is also responsible for PML body relocalization , we expressed either Z or R in EBV-negative cells and examined the resulting PML body distribution ( Fig .
2 ) .
Expression of Z in EBV-negative HeLa cells resulted in a redistribution of PML protein from PML bodies to a diffuse microspeckled pattern ( Fig .
2A and B ) .
However , expression of R in HeLa cells did not affect the localization of PML protein ( Fig .
2C and D ) .
Additionally , expression of the EBV early protein BMRF1 had no effect on PML protein localization ( data not shown ) .
These experiments were repeated several times with results identical to those presented .
Therefore , Z expression is sufficient to disrupt PML bodies .
Transactivation domain of Z is necessary for dispersal of PML protein .
The Z protein has functional domains for transcriptional transactivation , DNA binding , and homodimeriza-tion ( 25 , 47 , 61 ) .
To determine which region ( s ) of the Z protein is required for PML protein dispersal , we expressed various Z mutants ( Fig .
3 ) in EBV-negative HeLa cells and examined the resulting PML protein localization ( Fig .
4 ) .
Deletion of the first half of Z ( Z131-245 ) rendered the protein unable to disperse PML bodies ( Fig .
4C and D ) .
More specifically , amino acids 1 to 86 of the activation domain of Z are necessary for PML dispersal ( Fig .
4E and F ) .
ZA25-42 retained the ability to disperse PML bodies ( Fig .
4G and H ) .
Deletion of the first 24 amino acids of Z ( Z25-245 ) partially but not completely blocked the ability of the protein to disrupt PML bodies ( Fig .
41 and J ) .
Z constructs containing mutations within the DNA-binding domain of Z , including Z311 ( mutation at codon 185 which renders the protein unable to bind to DNA ) and Z ( S186A ) ( mutation at codon 186 which prevents protein from inducing lytic EBV replication ) retained the ability to disrupt PML bodies ( Fig .
4K , L , M , and N ) .
Therefore , amino acids 1 to 24 , which were previously shown to have a replication function distinct from the Z transcriptional function ( 69 ) , and the second half of the activation domain of Z ( amino acids 42 to 86 ) are necessary for Z to disperse PML bodies fully .
However , direct DNA binding is not required .
Z induces loss of high-molecular-weight isoforms of PML protein .
The PML protein has a molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa ; however , several higher-molecular-weight isoforms of PML protein exist .
These higher-molecular-weight isoforms are modified by SUMO-1 , a small ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently linked to PML protein ( 8 , 66 , 72 ) .

of SUMO-1-modified PML protein isoforms , we expressed Z in EBV-negative A549 cells via an adenovirus construct and performed an immunoblot with an anti-PML antibody ( Fig .
5 ) .
Cells that expressed Z but not the control protein LacZ lost the high-molecular-weight forms of PML protein ( Fig .
5 ) .
R expression did not affect PML protein levels or SUMO-1 modification .
This Z-induced loss of SUMO-1-modified PML protein isoforms was also detected in other cell types , including HeLa and D98/HE-R1 ( data not shown ) .
Z is modified by SUMO-1 .
The SUMO-1 modification of PML protein targets PML protein to nuclear bodies ( 60 , 86 ) .
To examine whether Z is modified by SUMO-1 , we expressed Z and HA-tagged SUMO-1 proteins in DG75 cells , harvested these cells in a rapidly denaturing buffer which has been shown transactivation DNA dim .

previously to prevent loss of SUMO-1 ( 17 ) , and performed immunoblot analysis with anti-Z and anti-HA antibodies ( Fig .
6A ) .
Using these harvesting conditions , the anti-Z antibody detected at least two larger bands ( at approximately 50 and 66 kDa ) , and possibly a third larger band , in addition to the normal Z band ( 35 kDa ) ( Fig .
6A , left panel , lane 3 ) .
Increasing amounts of transfected HA-SUMO-1 increased the intensity of these larger bands ( Fig .
6A , left panel , lanes 4 to 6 ) , indicating that increased levels of SUMO-1 lead to increased levels of Z/SUMO-1 .
To ensure that the 50 and 66-kDa Z bands were indeed modified by the HA-SUMO-1 protein , we probed an identical blot with anti-HA antibody ( Fig .
6A , right panel ) .
Lanes 10 to 12 clearly show that the 50- and 66-kDa bands are HA-SUMO-1-modified Z .
These results indicate that Z is SUMO-1 modified and that there are at least two forms of SUMO-1-modified Z .
We subsequently used the same technique to map the do-main ( s ) of Z that is required for SUMO-1 modification .
As shown in Fig .
6B , cotransfection of the HA-SUMO-1 plasmid with a series of wild-type and mutant Z plasmids induced SUMO-1 modification of all constructs containing the first 24 amino acids of Z but did not modify any mutant in which these residues were deleted .
Since there is only one lysine in the first 24 amino acids of Z ( residue 12 ) , we examined a Z construct that contained mutations at amino acids 12 and 13 and found that this mutant did not become SUMO-1 modified .
Therefore , Z is SUMO-1 modified on the lysine residing at amino acid position 12 .
Z and PML protein compete for limiting levels of SUMO-1 .
As evident from Fig .
6 , Z is very efficiently modified by SUMO-1 .
If SUMO-1 is limiting in cells , then a protein that is strongly modified by SUMO-1 could potentially disperse PML protein by competing with PML protein for limiting levels of SUMO-1 protein .
To examine whether Z is able to compete 2392 ADAMSON AND KENNEY anti-Z anti-PML 7131-245 won 786-245 c '' ZA25-42 - ZA25-42 Vor .

The cells were harvested so as to preserve SUMO-1 modification , and we performed immunoblot analysis with an anti-HA antibody ( Fig .

The SUMO-1 modification of PML protein was decreased in the presence of Z ( compare lanes 3 and 5 ) , while the SUMO-1 modification of Z remained unchanged in the presence of PML protein ( compare lanes 4 and 5 ) .
When the level of cotransfected HA-SUMO-1 plasmid was increased to 10 ug , SUMO-1 modification of PML protein in the presence of Z was partially rescued .
Additionally , the total level of PML protein was slightly decreased by Z .
A decrease in total PML protein levels in the presence of Z is not unexpected , however , since Fig .

greatly stabilizes PML protein .
As shown in Fig .
7C , the Z SUMO-1 modification site , lysine 12 , is required for inhibition of PML protein SUMO-1 modification .
These results suggest that the level of SUMO-1 is limiting in cells and that Z out-competes PML protein for SUMO-1 modification .
Loss of the SUMO-1 modification site of Z does not prevent PML body disruption .
To determine if SUMO-1 modification of Z is required for the disruption of PML bodies , we expressed the Z mutant lacking the SUMO-1 site , Zm12/13 , in HeLa cells and performed immunocytochemistry to determine the localization of PML protein in these transfected cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
Surprisingly , the Zm12/13 mutant retained the ability to disperse PML bodies ( Fig .
8B and C ) .
These data suggest that while competition for SUMO-1 may play a role in Z-induced PML body dispersion , Z must also use another mechanism to disperse PML bodies .
Induction of lytic replication in Akata cells leads to rapid SUMO-1 modification of Z .
To examine whether lytic replication would yield levels of SUMO-1-modified Z comparable to the levels obtained with transfected plasmids , we induced EBV-positive Akata cells to undergo lytic replication via cross-linking of the surface IgG by anti-IgG .
Three hours after in-duction , the cells were harvested so as to preserve SUMO-1 modification , and immunoblot analysis was performed with an anti-Z antibody ( Fig .
9 ) .
While control cells ( no anti-IgG ) did not express Z , the anti-IgG-treated cells expressed Z as well as higher-molecular-weight forms of Z corresponding to SUMO-1-modified species .
Therefore , physiological levels of Z and SUMO-1 are sufficient to produce high levels of SUMO-1-modified Z .
DISCUSSION The EBV immediate-early protein Z is required for expression of the EBV early genes and plays an essential role in replication mediated through the lytic origin of replication ( oriLyt ) .
In addition to these direct roles in lytic viral replica J. tion , increasing evidence suggests that Z manipulates the host cell environment through a variety of different mechanisms , presumably to provide favorable conditions for viral replication .
For example , Z inhibits cell cycle progression ( 12 ) , activates the p38 kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascades ( 1 ) , and alters p53 ( 84 ) and CBP function ( 2 ) .
Here we show that the Z protein also induces dispersion of nuclear PML bodies , an ability it shares with at least two other immediate-early proteins in the herpesvirus family .
PML body dispersion by Z requires amino acids 1 through 86 , containing the Z transactivation domain and an essential replication function , and is associated with loss of PML protein SUMO-1 modification .
We also found that Z is SUMO-1 modified over residue 12 , suggesting that SUMO-1 modification may play a role in targeting Z to specific domains within the nucleus or moderating its stability or protein-protein interac-tions .
SUMO-1 modification of Z may also provide a mechanism for PML body dispersion , since Z competes with PML protein for SUMO-1 .
However , unmodified Z retains the ability to disperse PML bodies , indicating that another mechanism must also exist for PML body dispersion .
Given that deletion of amino acids 1 to 86 totally prevents dispersal of PML bodies by Z while deletion of amino acids 1 to 25 only partially prevents dispersion , it appears that the transcriptional activator region of Z encodes a function ( as yet undefined ) required for full PML body dispersion .
PML bodies have become an increasingly intense area of study because , although their specific function remains uncer-tain , they clearly play an important role in tumor suppression .
PML bodies are made up of several proteins , some of which have known functions ( CBP and Rb ) , and some of which have unknown functions ( Sp100 and PML protein ) .
Since some of the components are transcriptional regulators and PML protein itself is structurally similar to a transcription factor , it has been suggested that PML bodies play a role in regulating cellular transcription .
Although PML bodies themselves are devoid of any nucleic acid , nucleic acids can be found along their periphery ( 9 ) .
SUMO-1 is another component of PML bodies .
SUMO-1 is found covalently attached to at least two PML body proteins , PML and S $ p100 .
Although structurally similar to ubiquitin , SUMO-1 does not target proteins for degradation .
Instead , SUMO-1 stabilizes proteins and can act to guide them to their appropriate locations within the nucleus .
The SUMO-1 modification of PML protein appears to be of utmost importance-PML protein must be SUMO-1 modified in order to reside within PML bodies , and if PML protein is not present in these bodies , other PML body members do not localize properly ( 86 ) .
Therefore , PML protein seems to be the main organizer of the PML body .
We have demonstrated in this study that EBV lytic replication disperses PML bodies , transforming nuclear dots into tiny microspeckles .
When either immediate-early protein , Z or R , is expressed in cells latently infected with EBV , PML protein becomes dispersed , presumably because expression of either protein activates the entire EBV lytic cascade .
In EBV-positive cells , the redistributed protein appears to form larger aggregates than in EBV-negative cells , potentially due to the formation of EBV replication centers containing PML protein ( 11 ) .
However , in EBV-negative cells , only Z is capable of Vor .

dispersing PML bodies .
Therefore , R likely indirectly disperses PML bodies in EBV-positive cells by activating the expression of Z .
Our data show that Z is SUMO-1 modified and that at least two different SUMO-1-modified isoforms exist .
Since the SUMO-1 modification of PML protein is responsible for its localization into discrete nuclear bodies , SUMO-1 modification may likewise target Z to PML bodies .
We have been unable to show that Z colocalizes with PML bodies ( data not shown ) .
However , it is possible that transient localization of Z into PML bodies does occur prior to the disruption of PML bodies .
In many respects , our findings here are reminiscent of previous reports regarding the effects of HSV-1 and CMV on PML bodies .
In the case of HSV-1 , the immediate-early protein ICPO , like Z , disperses PML bodies .
In cells infected with intact HSV , new nuclear foci appear after PML bodies are disrupted , and these new foci function as HSV-1 replication compartments that contain HSV-1 replication proteins as well as PML protein ( 11 ) .
This suggests a role for PML protein in viral replication .
CMV also disrupts PML bodies shortly after infection .
In the case of CMV , the IE1 protein is targeted to and disperses PML bodies , possibly through a mechanism involving direct protein-protein interactions between IE1 and PML protein ( 3 ) .
In contrast , the CMV IE2 protein is also targeted to but does not disperse PML bodies .
Similar to HSV-1 , CMV replication compartments ( which contain IE2 as well as several other essential viral replication proteins ) subsequently form adjacent to the former PML bodies ( 5 ) .
Another striking similarity is the ability of all three viruses HSV-1 , CMV , and EBV to decrease the relative amount of the SUMO-1-modified forms of PML protein .
Although the exact mechanisms by which herpesvirus immediate-early proteins reduce the abundance of SUMO-1-modified PML protein remains unknown , in the case of HSV-1 , at least , this process can be reversed by proteosome inhibitors ( 13 , 22 ) , suggesting that HSV-1 preferentially activates degradation of SUMO-modi-fied PML protein .
In contrast , we did not find that proteosome inhibitors reverse the effect of Z on PML protein SUMO-1 modification ( unpublished data ) .
It is intriguing that both the Z and CMV IE1 proteins are SUMO-1 modified .

modification machinery is limiting in cells , one potential mechanism by which Z ( and CMV IE1 ) could inhibit SUMO-1 modification of PML protein would be through direct competition for a limiting factor , similar to the ability of the adenovirus E1A protein to prevent histone acetylation of cellular genes by direct competition for CBP/p300 .
Against this hypothesis is the finding that the CMV IE1 protein ( which , in contrast to Z , interacts directly with the PML protein ) inhibits SUMO modification of only a limited number of known SUMO-1 substrates ( 13 , 22 , 59 ) .
However , Z appears to be a highly efficient substrate for SUMO-1 modification , even though the Z , SUMO-1 modification site ( DVKFT ) does not conform to the previously reported consensus sequence ( I/L ) KxE ( 73 ) .
Indeed , in cells cotransfected with Z and SUMO-1 expression vectors , Z appears to be the major SUMO-1-modified protein in the host cell ( Figs .
6 and 7 ) , and Z competed with PML Vor .
75 , 2001 Zm12/13 protein for cotransfected SUMO-1 .
Alternatively , since phos-phorylation of the PML protein has been shown to inhibit SUMO-1 modification ( 60 ) , Z could potentially prevent PML protein SUMO-1 modification by increasing the level of PML protein phosphorylation .
To our knowledge , Z ( in addition to CMV IE1 and IE2 ) is only the third viral protein shown to be SUMO-1 modified .
As discussed above , SUMO-1 modification of Z , like PML protein , could potentially be important for its localization to PML bodies .
Alternatively , SUMO-1 modification could affect the stability of Z or its interactions with other proteins .
Mutation of the two SUMO-1 modification sites in the CMV IE2 protein was recently shown to inhibit its transcriptional function without affecting protein stability or nuclear localization ( 35 ) .

Given the increasing evidence that PML bodies regulate transcription in the cell , it is interesting that the domain of Z required for full PML body dispersion ( amino acids 1 through 86 ) is also known to be required for Z transcriptional function ( 25 ) .
An increasing number of important cellular transcriptional proteins , including CBP , p53 , Ap-1 , Rb , Daxx , and Spl , have been shown to be regulated by their interactions with PML bodies .
Similarly , in the HSV-1 ICPO protein , small mutations in the RING finger domain which disrupt the ability of ICPO to disperse PML bodies considerably decrease the ability of ICPO to transcriptionally activate early HSV-1 promoters and decrease viral replication by 10- to 100-fold ( 21 ) .
The ability of Z to disperse PML bodies may likewise be important for its transcriptional function and/or its well-described ability to modulate the activity of cellular transcription factors such as CBP and p53 ( 2 , 83 , 84 ) .
At this point it remains unknown whether lytic EBV infection , like HSV-1 and CMV infection , also incorporates PML protein into replication foci .
The Hayward group has shown that a specific mutation affecting only residues 12 and 13 in Z impairs Z replication function but not transactivator function ( 69 ) .
As shown here , this mutation also prevents SUMO-1 modification of Z .
Thus , SUMO-1 modification of Z may well play a role in lytic EBV replication .
Increasing evidence suggests that a variety of PML protein-dependent functions in the cell would be inhibitory to viral replication in the host .
Most importantly , PML protein is required for apoptosis induced by several different types of stim-uli , including interferon ( 27 , 50 ) , and for inducing MHC class I presentation ( 85 ) .
The fact that so many different viruses encode mechanisms to disrupt PML body function suggests that this protein may have a profoundly important role in vivo for controlling viral infection .
