1 Positive and Negative Regulation of Immunoglobulin Gene Expression by a Novel B-Cell-Specific Enhancer Element JIYANG WANG , MAKOTO OKETANI , anp TAKESHI WATANABE* Medical Institute of Bioregulation , Kyushu University , Maidashi 3-1-1 , Higashi-ku , Fukuoka 812 , Japan Received 14 August 1990/Accepted 29 September 1990 A new B-cell-specific enhancer element has been identified 3 ' of E4 and the octamerlike motifs in the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer .
Tandem copies of this 67-bp Mn/I-Alul fragment , when fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by the conalbumin promoter , stimulated transcription in B cells but not in Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells .
Footprinting analysis revealed that the identical sequence CCGAAACTGAAAAGG , designated E6 , was protected by nuclear extracts from B cells , T cells , or HeLa cells .
Gel mobility shift assays using a synthetic E6 motif detected a B-cell-specific complex in addition to a ubiquitous band found also in T cells and HeLa cells .
In agreement with the results of gel retardation assays , tandem copies of the E6 motif stimulated transcription in ARH77 and Raji cells but not in Jurkat or HeLa cells .
Furthermore , a mutant E6 motif lost both in vitro binding activity and in vivo enhancer activity .
In striking contrast to the mouse Ig heavy-chain enhancer , in which the octamer motif acts as a B-cell-specific enhancer element , the human enhancer contains an octamerlike sequence with one base substitution which bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own .
Interestingly , the Mnil-Alul fragment could suppress the basal-level activity of the conalbumin promoter in both Jurkat and HeLa cells .
Moreover , simian virus 40 enhancer activity was blocked by the Ma/l-Alul fragment in HeLa cells but not in B cells .
Thus , the novel enhancer element identified in this study is probably a target site for both positive and negative factors .
Transcription of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes is regulated by at least two elements : promoters 5° of V regions and an enhancer within the J ( joining ) -C ( constant ) intron ( 3 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 31 ) .
The J-C intron enhancer probably not only is involved in the regulation of transcription of rearranged Ig genes but also plays a crucial role in the regulation of Ig gene rearrangement during B-cell differentiation ( 8 ) .
The activity of the Ig gene enhancer is strictly regulated by multiple trans-acting factors that interact with each other and with cis-acting enhancer elements .
Thus , identification and characterization of such factors , especially B-cell-specific ones , is important for elucidating the mechanism by which B cells differentiate from bone marrow stem cells .
The mouse Ig heavy-chain gene enhancer has been investigated by many groups .
Several enhancer motifs such as El to E5 and the octamer have been identified ( 6 ) .
These motifs bind trans-acting factors that act collectively to enhance transcription ( 15 , 23 , 34 , 40 ) .
Among these , the octamer sequence ATTTGCAT has been shown to be a B-cell-specific motif that binds both ubiquitous ( octl ) and B-cell-specific ( oct2A and oct2B ) factors ( 10 , 22 , 35 , 36 , 38 ) .
On the other hand , negative transcriptional control has also been suggested by several groups ( 17 , 21 ) .
Two repressor elements , one located 5 ' of the E2 motif and the other found 3 ' of the E4 and octamer motifs , have been identified by deletion analysis ( 2 , 16 , 18 , 32 , 33 , 41 , 43 ) .
Therefore , both positive and negative regulation seem to be responsible for the B-cell specificity of the whole Ig enhancer .
The human Ig heavy-chain enhancer does not contain the same complete octamer sequence as found in the mouse enhancer .
Instead , it contains three octamerlike sequences , ATTTGCGT , ATGCAAAA , and ATTTICAT , each with one base substitution ( 24 ) .
It is necessary to clarify whether * Corresponding author .
75 these octamerlike sequences act as B-cell-specific enhancer elements and bind octamer-binding proteins .
Our initial studies revealed that these octamerlike motifs have only very low affinity for the octamer-binding proteins in an in vitro binding assay , indicating that there could be other B-cell-specific elements instead of these octamerlike sequences .
With the aim of identifying such B-cell-specific elements , we analyzed the human Ig gene enhancer in detail in a transient in vivo assay system .
Short segments of the enhancer and polymers of them were tested for enhancer activity in various cell lines .
In this study , we have identified a new B-cell-specific enhancer element located 3 ' of the E4 and the octamerlike sequence region .
This element contains a novel motif named E6 , which acts as an enhancer element in B cells but not in HeLa cells .
Surprisingly , this element could also reduce the basal-level activity of the conalbumin promoter and even block simian virus ( SV40 ) enhancer activity in HeLa cells .
Thus , this element may be involved in both positive and negative regulation of Ig gene expression .
Our data also revealed that the octamerlike sequence by itself showed no enhancer activity when polymerized but could increase the activity of the novel B-cell-specific element identified in this study .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of plasmids .
The human Ig heavy-chain gene enhancer ( 958-bp Miul-Hpal fragment ) was divided into six fragments .
Various enhancer deletion mutants were cloned into the BamHI site either 5 ' upstream or 3 ' downstream of plasmid pconaCAT ( 20 ) , which contains the conalbumin promoter driving the CAT ( chloramphenicol acetyltransfer-ase ) gene , or into the 5 ' or 3 ' region of pIgCAT ( containing the human Ig promoter ) .
In some cases , two separate fragments were ligated to obtain an internal deletion mutant or to make appropriate combinations .

CAT activities of various enhancer deletion mutants in ARH77 , a human plasmacytoma cell line .
The human Ig heavy-chain enhancer was divided into six fragments : 0 , 340 bp ; 1 , 176 bp ; 2 , 95 bp ; 3 , 123 bp ; 4 , 133 bp ; and 5 , 96 bp .
E1 , E2 , HE2 , and E4 motifs were determined both by sequence homology to the mouse enhancer and by protein binding except for E4 , which has not been shown to bind a factor in vitro .
Three octamerlike sequences ( each with one base change ) are indicated by oct ' 3 , oct ' 4 , and oct ' 5 .
The wild-type and deletion mutants of the Ig enhancer ( lines c to g ) were cloned 5 ' of the conalbumin promoter in the natural orientation and transfected into ARH77 cells by the DEAE-dextran method .
Relative CAT activity was calculated by comparison with the wild-type ( wt ) human Ig enhancer , whose activity was set at 100 % .
Each transfection was repeated four times , and representative data are shown .
Means + standard deviations were calculated as described in Materials and Methods .
purified by two rounds of CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation , followed by dialysis against a buffer containing 10 mM Tris hydrochloride ( pH 8.0 ) and 1 mM EDTA .
Transfection and CAT assay .
Cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran protocol as described by Grosschedl and Baltimore ( 13 ) .
A 10- to 15-pg sample of plasmid was used in each transfection .
At 48 h after transfection , cells were collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline , and cell lysates were prepared by freezing and thawing cells suspended in a lysate buffer ( 250 mM Tris hydrochloride [ pH 7.8 ] , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 10 % glycerol ) five times .
The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm at 4°C , and the supernatant was used in the CAT assay as described by Gorman et al .
( 12 ) .
Representative results are shown .
Average activity + standard deviation was determined by densi-tometric scanning of the autoradiograms from two to four independent transfections .
The number of transfections is indicated for the figures and tables .
Nuclear extracts and mobility shift assay .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al .
( 5 ) .
The gel mobility shift assay was carried out in a total volume of 20 pl containing 12 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethane-sulfonic acid ( HEPES ; pH 7.9 ) , 60 mM KCI , 4 mM MgCi ; , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 12 % glycerol , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 mg of pepstatin A per ml , 10 U of aprotinin INN per ml , appropriate amounts of poly ( dI-dC ) , end-labeled target DNA , and nuclear extracts .
The reaction mixture was incubated at 4°C for 15 to 20 min .
The resulting complex was loaded on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel ( acrylamide/bisacrylamide weight ratio of 29:1 ) containing 6.7 mM Tris hydrochioride ( pH 7.5 ) , 3.3 mM sodium acetate , and 1 mM EDTA , which had been prerun for 30 min .
The gel was run 2 to 3 h at 4°C at 11 V/cm , dried , and autoradiographed at -80°C with intensifying screens .
DNase I protection assay ( footprinting ) .
Probes for footprinting were labeled at either 5 ' end , using T4 polynucleotide kinase .
The labeled probes were gel purified , extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol ( 25:24:1 ) , and precipitated with ethanol .
The reaction mixture contained 10° cpm of labeled probe , 3 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , and appropriate amounts of nuclear proteins in a total volume of 40 wl in the buffer used in the mobility shift assay .
The mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 to 20 min and then digested with DNase I ( 0.25 ug/ml ! )
for 60 s at 20°C .
Digestion was stopped with 20 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) -0.2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -0.3 M NaCl-2 pug of yeast tRNA per ml , extracted with phenol , and precipitated with ethanol .
The samples were loaded on an 8 % urea gel .
G+ A cleavage was done as described by Maxam and Gilbert ( 26 ) .
RESULTS Multiple domains are required for strong enhancer activity .
Deletion mutants of the human Ig heavy-chain gene enhancer were cloned 5 ' of the CAT gene driven by the conalbumin promoter , and transient CAT activity was examined ( Fig .
1 ) .
Similar to the mouse enhancer , the human heavy-chain gene enhancer contains multiple domains .
Fragment 3 seemed to be one of the crucial elements , since any combination that included fragment 3 and others generally exhibited strong activity ( Fig .
1 , lines f and g ) .
Fragment Ol ( line d ) , which contains the El and E2 motifs , had little Vor .
11 , 1991 enhancer activity , indicating that these motifs alone are not sufficient for enhancer activity .
Fragment 012 ( line e ) had only moderate enhancer activity .
This is in contrast to observations that the corresponding region in the mouse enhancer showed strong activity ( 18 , 19 ) .
This difference could be due to the absence in the human heavy-chain enhancer of both the E3 motif and two of the three virus enhancer core sequences found in the mouse enhancer .
The E3 motif has been shown to be a strong enhancer element ( 4 ) .
However , instead of the E3 motif , the human enhancer contains the HE2 region , which has been suggested to be an enhancer motif ( 1 ) .
Fragment 345 ( line f ) had about 90 % wild-type enhancer activity , in contrast to only 10 to 30 % activity for the corresponding region in the mouse enhancer ( 19 , 23 , 37 ) .
Although human and mouse enhancers are active in cells of either species in a B-cell-specific manner , some motifs ( such as El , E2 , and E4 ) are found in both enhancers , while others ( such as E3 and the octamer ) are not found in the human enhancer .
Therefore , it is not surprising that there is some discrepancy between our results for the human enhancer and other reports on the mouse enhancer .
Similar results were obtained when these enhancer deletion mutants were inserted 3 ' downstream of the CAT gene or when the conalbumin promoter was replaced by a human Ig promoter ( data not shown ) .
Transfection of these mutant enhancers into NS1 , a mouse myeloma cell line , revealed similar results ( our unpublished data ) .
Fragments 3 , 4 , and 5 , each containing an octamerlike sequence , exhibit different enhancer activities , We then focused on fragment 345 , not only because it showed stronger enhancer activity than did the corresponding region of mouse enhancer but also because we were interested in examining the influence of the three octamerlike sequences contained within this region .
Fragment 3 ( Fig .
2 , line j ) but not fragments 4 and 5 ( lines k and 1 ) exhibited enhancer activity .
Two copies of fragment 3 were as active as the wild-type human enhancer ( line a ) .
In contrast , two copies of either fragment 4 ( fragment 44 ; line e ) or fragment 5 ( fragment 55 ; line i ) showed no enhancer activity .
Various combinations of these fragments also confirmed that only fragment 3 stimulated transcription .
Combinations of fragments 4 and 5 ( fragments 45 and 54 ; lines f and h ) displayed no enhancer activity .
Only the combinations that contained fragment 3 ( fragments 34 , 35 , 43 , and 53 ; lines b , c , d , and g ) were active .
Furthermore , combinations in which fragment 3 was placed near the conalbumin promoter ( fragments 43 and 53 ; lines d and g ) exhibited stronger activity than did the reverse combinations ( fragments 34 and 35 ; lines b and c ) .
These data demonstrated that fragment 3 , but not fragment 4 or 5 , exhibited enhancer activity despite the fact that they all contain an octamerlike sequence .
Two copies of fragment 3 , when cloned 3 ' of the CAT gene , also strongly stimulated transcription ( data not shown ) , suggesting that fragment 3 contains an enhancer element .
The activity of fragment 3 is B-cell specific , but the E4 and oct ' 3 motifs within fragment 3 show no enhancer activity .
We then tested the cell type specificity of fragment 3 , using pSV2CAT ( containing the SV40 promoter and enhancer ) or pSconaCAT ( containing the conalbumin promoter and SV40 enhancer ) as positive controls .
Fragment 3 or its dimers exhibited strong enhancer activity in ARH77 plasmacytoma cells ( Fig .
3a ) but not in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
3b ) or HeLa cells ( Fig .
3¢ ) .
The Ddel-Hinfl fragment , which contains the E4 and octamer motifs in the mouse enhancer , has been shown to be a potent B-cell-specific enhancer when oligomerized ( 10 ) .

CAT activities of fragments 3 , 4 , and 5 in ARH77 cells .
Fragment 3 , 4 , or 5 cloned into the Hincll site of the pUC polylinker was cut out by SphI and BamHI digestion and recloned into the Sphl and BamHI site 5° of the conalbumin promoter of plasmid pconaCAT ( lines j to 1 ; see Fig .
7 for the restriction enzyme map ) .
The resulting plasmids were then digested with BamHI , and fragment 3 , 4 , or 5 was again cloned into this BamHI site to generate nine different constructs ( lines a to i ) .
Average relative CAT activities + standard deviations were calculated from four independent transfections .
Fragment 3 contains E4 and an octamerlike ( oct ' 3 ) motif , the sequences of which are highly homologous to the corresponding regions of the mouse enhancer .
To test whether the B-cell-specific activity of fragment 3 is due to the presence of E4 and oct ' 3 motifs , fragment 3 was further divided into short segments by digestion with restriction enzymes Ddel and Mill .
In addition , two synthetic oligonucleotides ( S43 and $ 35 ) were made to cover the breakpoints of the two restriction enzymes ( Fig .
4 ) .
These short segments and polymers of two to six copies were tested for enhancer activity .
In striking contrast to the mouse enhancer , up to six copies of the Bg/lI-Mnll fragment , which contains both the E4 and oct ' 3 motifs , showed no enhancer activity in human B cells ( Fig .
4 , line d ) .
In addition , constructs containing up to four copies of the $ 43 oligonucleotide , which also contains the E4 and oct ' 3 motifs , were similarly inactive .
$ 43 is a region in the human enhancer corresponding to the Ddel-Hinfl fragment of the mouse enhancer described by Gerster et al .
( 10 ) , the restriction sites being replaced by BamHI sites in our study .
Gerster et al .
reported strong B-cell-specific enhancer activity by three or four copies of the Ddel-Hinfl fragment and showed that the E4 and octamer motifs were responsible for this activity .
In contrast , our data suggests that the human E4 and oct ' 3 region can not stimulate transcription , probably because of its limited ability to bind octamer-binding proteins ( see below ) .
Similarly , six copies of the three octamerlike sequences ( lines h , i , and j ) showed no enhancer activity .
These octamerlike sequences alone may be too weak to stimulate transcription , suggesting the existence of other B-cell-specific enhancer elements .

1. pSV2CAT ( containing the SV40 enhancer and promoter ) and pSconaCAT ( containing the SV40 enhancer conalbumin promoter ) were used as positive controls .

The Mnill-Alul fragment is a novel B-cell-specific enhancer element .

4 , line e ) .

BioL .
of this fragment was almost as active as the wild-type enhancer activity in ARH77 cells .
To date , no motif has been reported within this fragment , either by factor binding or by in vivo functional analysis .
Therefore , this fragment represents a new enhancer element in the human Ig heavy-chain gene enhancer .
Although duplication of the Bg/II-Ddel fragment exhibited no activity ( Fig .
4 , line b ) , deletion of BgilI-Ddel from fragment 3 decreased the activity ( Fig .
4 , line c ) , indicating the presence of possible enhancer motifs within the Bg/II-Ddel fragment .
Similarly , two copies of Mnll-Alul had no activity ( Fig .
4 , line e ) , but two copies of Ddel-Alul ( i.e. , Ddel-Mnll plus Mnll-Alul ) became active ( Fig .
4 , line c ) , suggesting that the Ddel-Mnll fragment ( which is similar to oligonucleotide $ 43 except for lacking 6 bp at the 3 ' end ) could increase the activity of the Mn/I-Alul fragment .
Unlike the mouse E4 and octamer region , however , the E4 and oct ' 3 region in the human enhancer could not act as an enhancer on its own even when polymerized .
Thus , the B-cell-specific enhancer element fragment 3 can be divided into three elements : a Mn/I-Alul fragment that can act as an enhancer when oligomerized and two other fragments ( BailI-Ddel and Ddel-Mnll ) that exhibit enhancer activity only when combined with the Mn/I-Alul element .
We then examined whether the enhancer activity of the Mnll-Alul fragment is B-cell specific .
Multiple copies of this fragment stimulated transcription in both human ( ARH77 ) and mouse ( X63 ) plasmacytoma cells but not in Jurkat or HeLa cells ( Table 1 ) .
Interestingly , the oligomerized Mn/l-Alul fragment reproducibly decreased basal-level activity of the conalbumin promoter in Jurkat cells ( Table 1 ; compare the CAT activity of pconaCAT [ 13 % ] with that of 4x Mnll-Alul [ 5 % ] ) and in HeLa cells ( Table 1 ; compare the activity of peonaCAT [ 12 % ] with that of 4x Mnll-Alul [ 1 % ] ) , suggesting a suppressive effect of this element in non-B cells .

A B-cell-specific factor binds to a novel enhancer motif E6 .
DNase I footprinting analysis using nuclear extracts prepared from ARH77 or Manca cells revealed that the sequence 5-CCGAAACTGAAAAGG-3 ' ( designated E6 ) was protected ( Fig .
Sa and b ) .
Interestingly , nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells exhibited a protection pattern identical to that of ARH77 cells ( Fig .
5c ) .
We then tested the binding activities of various nuclear extracts in a gel mobility shift assay , using a synthetic oligonucleotide comprising the E6 motif .
All of the tested cell lines exhibited a common retarded band ( Fig .
6 , closed arrowheads ) .
However , with ARH77 plasmacytoma cells and Manca B lym-phoblastoid cells , another retarded species that migrated faster was observed ( Fig .
Ga and b , open arrowheads ) .
Both complexes could be abolished by the synthetic E6 oligonucleotide but not by a mutant one .
Thus , two kinds of factors , one ubiquitous and the other B-cell specific , bind to the identical DNA motif , E6 .
The sequence CCGAAACTGAAAAGG ( E6 ) acts as an enhancer element in B cells but not in HeLa cells .
The E6 motif , which was protected in DNase I footprinting assays , was synthesized and polymerized to two , four , and six copies .
Six tandem copies of the E6 motif exhibited enhancer activity in ARH77 and Raji cells but not in Jurkat or HeLa cells ( Table 2 ) .
As expected , a mutant E6 motif , which had lost binding activity ( Fig .
6 ) , showed no enhancer activity .

The novel B-cell-specific element identified in this study is located 22 bp 3 ' downstream of the E4 and oct ' 3 motifs , within a region previously found to contain repressor elements ( 18 ) .
Indeed , three or four copies of the Mnll-Alul fragment reduced the basal activity of the conalbumin promoter in both Jurkat and HeLa cells ( Table 1 ) .
However , since the conalbumin promoter activity itself was not particularly strong , it was difficult to conclusively demonstrate an inhibitory effect in non-B cells from these data alone .
Although we repeatedly obtained similar inhibitory results , to confirm that there was a suppressive effect in non-B cells , we further tested the Mnil-Alul fragment on SV40 enhancer activity .
One or four copies of the Mn/I-Alul fragment or fragment 2 were cloned between the SV40 enhancer and the conalbumin promoter driving CAT gene transcription ( Fig .
7 ) .
We placed the Mn/ll-Alul fragment immediately upstream of the conalbumin promoter because it has been shown that efficient inhibition of transcription can be obtained when a negative control element is located close to the promoter ( 16 ) .
Although the SV40 enhancer showed strong activity in HeLa cells , its activity was repressed by the Mnll-Alul fragment ( Fig .
7 , lines b and c ) .
By contrast , enhancement rather than suppression was observed in ARH77 cells ( Fig .
7 , lines b and c ) .
Suppression of SV40 enhancer activity in HeLa cells was not observed when fragment 2 ( Fig .
7 , line d ) , which contains a virus enhancer core sequence , was inserted between the SV 40 enhancer and the conalbumin promoter .
The finding that the Mrll-Alul fragment could block SV40 enhancer activity in HeLa cells but not in ARH77 cells further suggests that different factors bind to the E6 motif in B cells and HeLa cells .
DISCUSSION Identification of a novel B-cell-specific enhancer element .
Gerster et al .

Factors binding to the E6 motif .
A synthetic E6 sequence ( CCGAAACTGAAAAAG ) end labeled with [ y-PJATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase was used as a probe .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from various cell lines representing plasma cells ( ARHT77 ; a ) , mature B cells ( Manca ; b ) , T cells ( Jurkat ; c ) , and nonlymphoid cells ( HeLa ; d ) .

base variation .
Our results showed that these octamerlike sequences bind an octamer-binding protein ( oct1 , oct2A , or oct2B ) only with very low affinity ( unpublished data ) .
Fragment 3 , which contains one of the octamerlike sequences , exhibited enhancer activity in B cells , but not in Jurkat T cells or in HeLa cells , because of the presence of a novel B-cell-specific element identified in this study , which is located 3 ' downstream of the E4 and oct ' 3 regions .
To date , most studies have focused on the El to E4 and octamer motifs defined by in vivo footprinting by Ephrussi et al .
( 6 ) .
This novel B-cell-specific element was therefore not de-tected .
Footprinting analysis revealed protection of the sequence CCGAAACTGAAAAGG ( E6 ) .
Multiple copies of E6 alone can act as an enhancer in ARH77 plasmacytoma cells or Raji B ceils but not in HeLa cells ( Table 2 ) .
A computer search revealed that the E6 motif has no significant homology with the known enhancer motifs .
Perfect homology to the sequence AACTGAAA within the E6 motif , however , was found in the regulatory region of lymphotropic papovavirus ( 29 ) and in the 5 ' upstream region of the interferon-B gene ( 9 ) , but the surrounding sequences are different .
In fact , six copies of the sequence AACTGAAA exhibited no enhancer activity in ARH77 plasmacytoma cells ( data not shown ) .

E6 motif is composed of two partial repeats : CCGAAA and CTGAAA .
The E6-binding proteins may recognize these related short sequences with different affinities .
Whereas three or four copies of the Mn/I-Alul fragment acted as an enhancer , four copies of the E6 motif could not stimulate transcription .
Two possible explanations for this result can be considered .
The first is that the sequences surrounding the E6 motif are also important for the activity , for example , by stabilizing the factors that bind to the E6 motif .
The second is that there are other , unidentified motifs within the Mnll-Alul fragment , which may act collectively with the E6 SV40 enhancer Kpni _ 72bp 72bpP - BamHI “ W BamHI y-cona * -- -- -_ _ I -289 *1 CAT SphI % CAT activity ig Enhancer fragment ARHT77 Hela a. no fragment 100 100 b .

Suppression of SV40 enhancer activity by the Mn/l-Alul fragment .
One or four copies of the Mnil-Alul fragment and the human Ig heavy-chain enhancer fragment 2 were cloned into the -102 BamHI site , 5 of the conalbumin promoter driving CAT gene transcription .
The SV40 enhancer 72-bp repeat was then cloned into the -289 SphI site in the indicated orientation .
Activity of the plasmid containing only the SV40 enhancer was set at 100 % .

Further studies are required to clarify this phenome-non .
As revealed by gel retardation assays , a ubiquitous factor bound to the E6 motif was found in nuclear extracts prepared from all cell lines .
An additional factor faster in mobility than the ubiquitous factor was detected only in B cells .
At present , we can only speculate that this species may be responsible for the B-cell specificity of the Mn/l-Alul fragment and the E6 motif .
Despite the different mobilities of the two species in gel retardation assays , the two E6-binding proteins protected identical sequences in footprinting assays , indicating that they probably recognized the same motif .
They are similar in this regard to octl , oct2B , and oct2A ( 10 , 22 , 35 , 36 , 38 ) .
In vivo functional assays revealed that the E6 motif is active only in B cells , suggesting that the two factors likely have different activities .
Compared with octamer-binding proteins , the E6-binding proteins appear to be present at lower levels .
Preliminary results using nuclear proteins size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis ( 14 ) indicate that the B-cell-specific E6-binding protein has a molecular mass of between 45 and 67-kDa { unpublished data ) .
Inhibition of the SV40 enhancer by the Mn/l-Alul fragment in Hela cells .
An interesting phenomenon observed in this study was that the Mn/l-Alul fragment suppressed the basal activity of the conalbumin promoter in both Jurkat and HeLa cells .
This inhibition was not so dramatic , probably because the basal-level activity of the conalbumin promoter itself was relatively low .
When the SV40 enhancer was inserted 5 ' of the Mnill-Alul fragment , the inhibition was clearly evident in HeLa cells .
In contrast , there was no inhibition in B cells , and the activity was rather elevated .
Thus , the Mn/l-Alul fragment not only is a B-cell-specific enhancer element but also likely participates in the inactivation of the Ig gene enhancer in nonlymphoid cells .
Previous studies revealed that the expression of Ig genes is both positively and negatively regulated .
By introducing deleted or mutated enhancers into T cells or nonlymphoid cells , it has been shown that the Ig gene enhancer contains a ubiquitous enhancer in the central region including E2 , E3 , and core sequences ( 39 ) .
Sequences 5 ' upstream of the ubiquitous enhancer and 3 ' downstream of the E4 and octamer region have been defined as negative control elements , since deletion of each region led to the activation of the Ig gene enhancer in nonlymphoid cells ( 2 , 16 , 18 , 32 , 33 , 41 , 43 ) .
The newly identified B-cell-specific element is located 22 bp 3 ' downstream of the E4 and oct ' 3 motifs .
This region corresponds to a region of the mouse enhancer contained within the negative control element as defined by Kadesch et al .
( 18 ) .
They were , however , unable to determine the short segment responsible for the transcriptional repression .
In agreement with previous reports , the Mn/l-Alul fragment blocked SV40 enhancer activity in our assay system .
This result suggested to us that the Mn/l-Alul fragment may also block the activity of the ubiquitous enhancer found in the central region of the Ig heavy-chain gene enhancer .
Enhancers in general contain multiple elements .
Likewise , multiple repressor elements may also be required for the suppression of Ig gene expression in nonlymphoid cells .
The newly identified B-cell-specific enhancer element Mn/I-Alul may be one of such repressor elements in non-B cells .
The mechanism for the inhibition of SV40 enhancer activity is unknown .
The putative inhibitory factors binding to the E6 motif are likely to act through the promoter , since this element reduced the basal-level activity of the conalbumin NOVEL B-CELL-SPECIFIC ENHANCER ELEMENT 81 promoter in both Jurkat and HeLa cells .
Even in the presence of the SV40 enhancer , the Mnil-Alul fragment reduced activity to a level lower than the basal activity ( compare Table 1 with Fig .
7 ) .
This finding suggests that in this case the inhibition effect is dominant to the enhancer and probably due to the close proximity of the Mn/l-Alul fragment to the conalbumin promoter .
Inhibition of the SV40 enhancer could also be explained by interference of an inactive factor binding to the upstream region of the conalbumin promoter .
Suppression of SV40 enhancer activity was not observed when other DNA fragments such as fragment 2 were cloned immediately upstream of the conalbumin promoter , therefore ruling out the possibility that any DNA fragment closely located 5° of the promoter would inhibit its activity .
Gel retardation assays showed that different factors in B cells and HeLa cells bind to the E6 motif .
However , footprinting analysis revealed identical protection patterns by nuclear extracts prepared from ARH77 plasmacytoma cells or from Jurkat and HeLa cells , suggesting that the same cis-acting E6 motif within the Mni/l-Alul fragment mediates both positive and negative transcriptional regulation .
The nuclear proteins binding to the same E6 motif may exhibit different activities in B cells and non-B cells .
The E4 and oct ' 3 region alone can not act as an enhancer element .
The E4 and oct ' 3 region is highly homologous to the mouse E4 and octamer region and was expected to have enhancer activity .
However , our data clearly demonstrated that this region has no enhancer activity by itself , although it could act collectively when combined with the Mn/l-A/lul fragment .
This was revealed by the finding that two copies of the Ddel-Alul fragment had activity , in contrast to the lack of activity of two copies of the Mnll-Alul fragment ( Fig .
4 , lines c and d ) .
Similarly , the Bg/II-Ddel fragment exhibited no enhancer activity of its own , although its deletion resulted in a great decrease of enhancer activity ( Fig .
4 , lines b and c ) .
Thus , we have identified two other enhancer elements within fragment 3 , Bg/lI-Ddel and Ddel-Mnll , both of which could act synergistically with the B-cell-specific enhancer element Mn/I-Alul .
The octamer sequence ATGCAAAT or its inverse complement ATTTGCAT is found in the promoters as well as the enhancer of Ig genes and has been shown to be necessary for lymphoid-specific transcription .
A mutation in any of the first 7 bp of the octamer sequence ATGCAAAT abolished its in vivo promoter activity as well as its in vivo binding activity ( 42 ) .
The oct ' 3 ( ATTTGCGT ) , as well as oct ' 4 and oct ' 5 , bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity ( unpublished data ) , correlating with the lack of enhancer activity of this sequence .
Wirth et al .
( 42 ) showed that a mutant octamer sequence ATGCAAAG , which is also found in the SV40 enhancer , retained approximately 30 to 40 % of the wild-type octamer sequence ; however , the oct ' 4 with a mutation at the same location ( ATGCAAAA ) found in the human enhancer seems to have little activity , since neither two copies of fragment 4 ( which contains oct ' 4 ; Fig .
2 , line e ) nor six copies of oct ' 4 ( Fig .
4 , line i ) showed activity .
The lack of enhancer activity of the octamerlike sequences in the human enhancer , however , was compensated for by the presence of the E6 motif identified in this study .
Recently , a new B-cell-specific enhancer was identified 3 ' downstream of the Ca gene ( 30 ) .
As suggested by the authors , the 3 ' enhancer may be activated at later stages of B-cell maturation as a transcriptional enhancer .
The J-C intron enhancer becomes active during the early stages of B-cell differentiation , and its activation is likely to be asso- 82 WANG ET AL .
ciated with Ig gene rearrangement .
Thus , the novel enhancer element identified in our study is particularly intriguing since it likely interacts with both positive and negative factors .
Gene cloning of trans-acting factors that interact with this element will be necessary to better understand the mechanism of the activation or suppression of the Ig gene enhancer that is implicated in B-cell differentiation .
