Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center ' and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology , '' Karolinska Institute , S $ -171 77 Stockholm , Sweden , and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UPR 43 , Hopital St. Louis 1 , ° and Service de Biochimie , '' 75475 Paris Cedex 10 , France Received 14 November 1995/Accepted 11 January 1996 EBNA-5 is one of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -encoded nuclear proteins required for immortalization of human B lymphocytes .
In the nuclei of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines EBNA-5 is preferentially targetted to distinct nuclear foci .
Previously we have shown ( W. Q. Jiang , L. Szekely , V. Wendel-Hansen , N. Ringertz , G. Klein , and A. Rosén , Exp .
Cell Res .
197:314-318 , 1991 ) that the same foci also contained the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein .
Using a similar double immunofluorescence technique , we now show that these foci colocalize with nuclear bodies positive for PML , the promyelocytic leukemia-associated protein .
Artificial spreading of the chromatin by exposure to the forces of fluid surface tension disrupts this colocalization gradually , suggesting that the bodies consist of at least two subcomponents .
Heat shock or metabolic stress induced by high cell density leads to the release of EBNA-5 from the PML-positive nuclear bodies and induces it to translocate to the nucleoli .
In addition to their presence in nuclear bodies , both proteins are occasionally present in nuclear aggregates and doughnut-like structures in which PML is concentrated in an outer shell .
Nuclear bodies with prominent PML staining are seen in resting B lymphocytes .
This staining pattern does not change upon EBV infection .
In freshly infected cells EBNA-5 antigens are first distributed throughout the nucleoplasm .
After a few days intensely staining foci develop .
These foci coincide with PML-positive nuclear bodies .
At a later stage and in established lymphoblastoid cell lines EBNA-5 is almost exclusively present in the PML-positive nuclear foci .
The colocalization is restricted to EBV-infected human lymphoblasts .
The data presented indicate that the distinct EBNA-5 foci are not newly formed structures but the result of translocation of the viral protein to a specialized domain present already in the nuclei of uninfected cells .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) express six nuclear proteins ( EBNA-1 to -6 ) and three membrane proteins ( LMP1 , 2A , and 2B ) .
Six of the nine proteins , including the protein examined in the present study , EBNA-5 , are required for efficient immortalization ( 5 , 20 , 32 ) .
Together with EBNA-2 , EBNA-5 is one of the earliest nuclear proteins expressed in EBV-infected B cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
These two EBNAs can drive the resting B lymphocyte , the prime target of EBV infection , into the G , phase of the cell cycle ( 26 ) .
Levels of EBNA-5 expression are highest during the first days of EBV infection but decline later ( 11 ) .
In freshly infected cells , EBNA-5 is homogeneously distributed throughout the nucleoplasm .
After several days of infection EBNA-5 appears in distinct nuclear foci ( 29 ) .
In established LCLs the focal pattern dominates .
The homogeneous nucleoplasmic staining decreases or disappears completely ( 15 , 24 ) .
Previously we have found that the nuclear foci that contain EBNA-5 in LCLs also contain retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein ( 14 ) .
We also demonstrated that EBNA-5 is able to bind both Rb and pS3 proteins in vitro ( 30 ) .
High-level expression of EBNA-5 in freshly infected B cells coincides with the increased transient expression of p53 and augmented expression of Rb in the same cells ( 29 ) .

2562 prompted us to compare its immunofluorescence staining pattern with those of other nuclear proteins showing a focal expression pattern .
The literature contains many reports of such patterns and of nuclear bodies ( for reviews , see references 3 and 31 ) of unknown function .
The present study was carried out with the aim of examining the distribution of EBNA-5 in relation to bodies containing the PML ( promyelocytic leuke-mia-associated ) protein .
The gene encoding the PML protein was identified as the fusion partner of retinoic acid receptor « in the t ( 15:17 ) trans-locations of acute promyelocytic leukemias ( 7 , 16 ) .
The PML protein preferentially localized to distinct nuclear bodies or PODS , whereas the leukemia-associated fusion protein is distributed in a micropunctated fashion ( 9 ) .
Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemias with retinoic acids restores the punc-tated staining pattern ( 6 , 17 , 33 ) .
Nuclear bodies , corresponding to the normal PML staining pattern , were already identified decades ago , first by electron microscopy ( 8 ) and later by immunostaining with sera from patients with autoimmune conditions like primary biliary cirrhosis ( 18 ) .
Many of these sera react with PML itself .
Proteins encoded by DNA viruses have previously been found to accumulate in PML bodies .
The ICPO protein of herpes simplex virus , which contributes to the initiation of the immediate-early viral protein cascade ( 21 , 23 ) , is targeted to the PML- and $ p100-containing nuclear foci .

regulator of herpes simplex virus type 1 , has led to the entrapment of ICP4 in the ICPO-containing bodies ( 23 ) .
Infection with adenoviruses induces an extensive redistribution of the PML from the spherical nuclear bodies to filamentous structures .
The protein encoded by E4-ORF3 is responsible for this reorganization .
Furthermore , it was demonstrated that the E1A oncoprotein of adenovirus concentrates in the PML-positive nuclear bodies ( 4 ) .
In the present study , we show that EBNA-5 is accumulated in the PML-containing bodies both in freshly infected B cells and in established LCLs but disappears from these structures upon heat shock or metabolic stress or during chromatin spreading by surface tension .
EBNA-5 and PML in LCLs .
In order to establish whether the EBNA-5 ( 14 ) -and PML-containing nuclear bodies ( 8 , 9 ) were identical , lymphoblastoid cells were stained with anti-EBNA-5 mouse monoclonal and anti-PML rabbit polyclonal antibodies .
Immunofluorescent staining was carried out in the following way .
Cells were centrifuged on glass slides in a Cy-tospin centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and fixed with methanol-acetone ( 1:1 ) .
The slides were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min , washed in balanced salt solution , and incubated with the antibodies diluted in a blocking buffer ( 2 % bovine serum albumin plus 0.02 % NaN , in balanced salt solution ) .
The slides were washed five times in balanced salt solution after the individual incubation steps ( regularly 30 to 60 min at room temperature ) .
The following antibodies were used : JF186 , anti-EBNA-5 mouse monoclonal antibody ( 11 ) , anti-PML rabbit polyclonal serum ( 6 ) , fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Fab2 fragment of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin ( Ig ) ( Pierce ) , and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig ( Vector ) .
The secondary conjugates were further absorbed onto acetone-fixed IB4 cells ( 13 ) .
Double fluorescence stainings of EBNA-4 and PML were carried out in the following order : anti-EBNA-5 monoclonal antibody ( 1:40 ) , anti-PML ( 1:500 ) , fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse Ig ( 1:20 ) , normal mouse serum ( 1:50 ) , and Texas red-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig ( 1:30 ) .
The cross-reactions were excluded by replacing the primary antibodies with isotype-identical anti-simian virus 40 heat-labile enterotoxin monoclonal antibody and normal rabbit serum , respectively , in parallel reactions .
The images were recorded on a DAS microscope ( Leitz DM RB ) with a Hamamatsu dual-mode cooled charge-coupled device camera ( C4880 ) and analyzed on a Pentium personal computer using Image Pro-Plus ( Media Cybernetics ) and Adobe Photoshop programs .
Most of the studies were carried out on 1B4 cells , an LCL that contains one integrated copy of the EBV genome and uses the W viral promoter to initiate the giant message from which all the EBNAs are spliced .
1B4 , unlike most other LCLs , expresses high levels of EBNA-5 .
In [ B4 EBNA-5 is localized to brilliantly stained nuclear bodies as well as , to various extents , to homogeneously stained nucleoplasm .
In most LCLs EBNA-5 is restricted to the weakly or moderately stained nuclear bodies .
PML staining showed no difference between IB4 and other LCLs .
It detected 2 to 20 nuclear bodies , whereas the nucleoplasm remained essentially negative .
Figure 1 shows the results of double immunofluorescence staining and digital overlap analysis .
There was a high degree of colocalization between PML- and EBNA-5-positive nuclear bodies in interphase IB4 .
Ninety-six percent of the nuclear bodies were detectably positive for both proteins .
A similar colocalization was found in two other LCLs .
These cell lines were established 6 and 9 months earlier by infecting CD19-selected peripheral blood B cells , obtained from healthy do-nors , with B95-8 virus .
The two colocalized nuclear proteins , EBNA-5 and PML , were usually assembled in 2 to 20 nuclear dots of various sizes 2564 NOTES J. ViroL .

and shapes .
In most cases these structures were spherical , but occasionally they appeared as doughnut-like structures , aggregates of nuclear bodies , or thread-like structures .
Although the locations of EBNA-5- and PML-positive bodies were identical , the relative staining intensities of EBNA-5 and PML in individual dots varied .
High-resolution examination of the larger aggregates and the doughnut-like structures showed that the distribution of EBNA-5 within these bodies might be quite different from that of PML .
PML appeared to form an outer shell , whereas EBNA-5 was located inside these structures ( Fig .
2 ) .
PML and EBNA-5 in spread chromatin .
In order to study the relationship between the two colocalized proteins further , the chromatin was spread by the surface tension of a fluid drop with rapidly increasing surface area , according to the method of Schlammadinger ( 25 ) with the modification that prefixation was omitted and methanol-acetone ( 1:1 ) was used as a fixative .
In this procedure the chromatin forms a series of scaffold structures from which chromatin loops radiate laterally .
Double immunofluorescence staining showed that the PML-containing bodies did not change their size or shape upon chromatin spreading .
They remained preferentially localized within the area of the nuclear scaffold .
In contrast , the EBNA-5-containing dots became more numerous and tended to be associated with more-peripheral chromatin loops .
As a result , the extent of colocalization between EBNA-5 and PML decreased with increasing degrees of chromatin spreading ( Fig .
3 ) .
Heat shock disrupts the colocalization between EBNA-5 and PML .
We have recently shown that heat shock or metabolic stress induced by high cell density causes the reversible translocation of EBNA-5 to the nucleolus in 1B4 and other cells ( 28 ) .
Now we demonstrate that a brief heat shock ( 30 min at 45°C ) leads to the complete dissociation of EBNA-5 from the PML bodies .
The PML bodies remain in the nucleoplasm , and at the same time there is an almost complete relocation of EBNA-5 into the nucleoli ( Fig .
4 ) .
EBNA-5 and PML dissociate during mitosis .
The number and the staining intensity of PML-positive nuclear bodies vary with the cell cycle ( 18 ) .
We found that all interphase nuclei showed colocalization between EBNA-5 and PML ; conse-quently , the interphase position does not affect the colocalization .
In contrast , the proteins dissociated during mitosis .
PML preferentially accumulated in two to three intensely stained conglomerates within the area of the mitotic spindle , close to the chromosomes .
EBNA-5 was distributed diffusely over the whole cytoplasm ( Fig .
5 ) .
EBNA-5 and PML in freshly infected B cells .
In freshly infected B lymphocytes EBNA-5 appears as early as 12 h postinfection .
It is diffusely distributed in the whole nucleoplasm during the early hours but starts appearing in nuclear bodies as well by the end of the first day ( 29 ) .
Uninfected B cells contained intensely stained PML-positive nuclear bodies .
That distribution remained unchanged after EBV infection .
The nascent EBNA-5 bodies colocalized with the PML-positive structures from the earliest time at which they became visible .
Several days after infection , the EBNA-5 staining became completely restricted to distinct nuclear dots , showing perfect overlap with the PML-positive bodies ( Fig .
6 ) .
Colocalization between EBNA-5 and PML is restricted to EBV-infected human B lymphoblasts .
Expression of EBNA-5 from a retrovirus-based vector in CV1 monkey kidney epithe-lial cells , SW480 human colon carcinoma cells , and Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells leads to the accumulation of EBNA-5 in the nucleoplasm in an almost homogeneous fashion .
In addition , a fraction of the cells ( around 20 % ) also Vou .

Disruption of colocalization by spreading of the chromatin .
The extent of colocalization decreased in parallel with the increase in the extent of spreading .
The extent of spreading was calculated by dividing the area of the measured object by the area of an average unspread nucleus .
Moderate spreading ( 4.8-fold ; A to C ) only slightly affected the colocalization .
Further spreading ( 5.2-fold ; D to F ) showed clear differences in the staining pattern , whereas extensive spreading ( 19-fold ; G to I ) led to the dissociation of EBNA-5- and PML-positive structures .
EBNA-5 ( A , D , and G ; green ) , PML ( B , E , and H ; red ) , overlap ( C , F , and I ; white ) , and DNA ( blue ) are shown .

contain brilliantly stained nuclear bodies that contain Hsp70 heat shock protein as well ( 29 ) .
All of these cells contained PML bodies .
Interestingly , the EBNA-S5-positive foci showed no colocalization with the PML bodies in any of the transfec-tants .
Moreover , EBNA-S5-transfected EBV-negative DG75 Burkitt lymphoma cells , which express EBNA-5 antigens as fine speckled nuclear dots , failed to show colocalization with PML .
We also tested the virus-producing cell line B95-8 , a marmoset LCL .
PML showed well-defined nuclear bodies in these cells , whereas EBNA-5 was present in numerous nuclear dots that failed to colocalize with PML .
The PML-positive nuclear bodies are novel organelles that contain at least four , but presumably many more , different proteins ( 9 ) .
The disruption of these structures in promyelocytic leukemias by the expression of the PML-retinoic acid receptor fusion protein appears to play a key role in cell transformation ( 17 , 33 ) .
The function of PML and these nuclear bodies so far remains unknown .
Previous reports have suggested that PML bodies play a role in host cell resistance to viral infection and/or in the regulation of gene expression ( 9 ) .
PML-containing nuclear bodies appear to be important targets of interferon response .
Three proteins , i.e. , PML , $ p100 , and NDPS52 , are regulated by alfa and gamma interferon ( 12 , 19 , 27 ) .
The PML protein itself may act as a tumor suppressor gene product ( 22 ) .
Lytic infection of cells by DNA viruses like herpes simplex virus , cytomegalovirus , and adenovirus leads to the accumulation of viral regulatory proteins in the PML-containing nuclear bodies and eventually induces redistribution of the PML protein ( 10 ) .
Now we report that a latency-associated nuclear protein of EBV , EBNA-5 , also accumulates in the PML bodies at the early phase of the infection and persists in these structures in established LCLs .
Unlike the lytic-phase-associated proteins of other viruses , however , EBNA-5 does not induce morphological changes in the distribution of PML .
Our findings also suggest that the previously detected EBNA-5-Rb-positive blobs are not newly formed structures .
Rather , EBNA-5 accumulates in already-existing nuclear bodies .
The fact that EBNA-5 positive nuclear bodies in different transfected cells do not colocalize with PML argues that other cellular and/or viral factors that are present only in EBV-infected B lymphoblasts are required for the accumulation of EBNA-5 in the PML bodies .
Both PML and EBNA-5 are nuclear-matrix-associated proteins .
The chromatin spreading experiments suggest that the two proteins associate with different elements of the matrix .

Each bar represents 5 pm .
That in panel A applies to panels A to C , and that in panel D applies to panels D to F. The PML antigen remains on the scaffold , whereas EBNA-5 is spread with the outpouring chromatin .
On the basis of these findings , along with the differential localization patterns of the two proteins in the doughnut-like structures , we propose the following theory .
PML is part of the outer shell of the nuclear body , firmly anchored to the nuclear scaffold .
EBNA-5 , on the other hand , accumulates inside the body but still preserves the connection to elements of the nuclear matrix that are linked more intimately to the chromatin than to the rigid scaffold .
