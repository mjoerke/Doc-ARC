Fibroblast Growth Factor-1 ( FGF-1 ) Enhances IL-2 Production and Nuclear Translocation of NF-rB in FGF Receptor-Bearing Jurkat T Cells !
Victor M. Byrd , '' Dean W. Ballard , Geraldine G. Miller , and James W. Thomas Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) are heparin-binding proteins crucial to embryogenesis , angiogenesis , and wound healing .
FGF-1 is abundantly expressed in the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis and in rejecting allografts , sites of chronic immune-mediated inflammation .
The frequency of FGF-1-responsive T cells is increased in the peripheral blood of these disorders , and a high percentage of infiltrating T cells in rheumatoid arthritis synovium express receptors for FGF-1 .
To understand the action of FGF-1 in T cells , studies were initiated in Jurkat T cells that express the signaling isoform of FGF receptor-1 .
These experiments show that FGF-1 stimulation of Jurkat T cells provides a second signal that augments TCR-mediated IL-2 production .
Analogous to costimulation via CD28 , this activity is mediated through activation of Rel/rB , a family of transcription factors known to regulate IL-2 and other activation-inducible proteins .
FGF-1 alone induces modest nuclear translocation of B-binding proteins , and this translocation is enhanced by the combination of anti-CD3 and FGF-1 .
This NF-B binding complex is composed of transcriptionally active p65 ( ReIA ) /p50 heterodimers and results primarily from the targeted degradation of an inhibitor that sequesters Rel/rB in the cytoplasm .
These data are the first to show a connection between FGF-1 signaling and NF-rB activation outside of embryonic development .
The signaling events that link FGF receptor-1 engagement and activation in Jurkat are probably distinct from the CD28 costimulation pathway , since FGF-1-induced Rel/B binding proteins do not contain significant levels of c-Rel and are not identical with the CD28 response complex .
cidic and basic fibroblast growth factors ( FGPF-1 and A FGF-2 ) '' are prototypes of heparin binding growth fac- tors that stimulate proliferation , migration , and differentiation of cells of neuroectodermal and mesodermal origin ( reviewed in Refs .
1-4 ) .
They are expressed widely during normal embryonic development and often in adult tissues at sites of injury , where their angiogenic activity contributes to wound healing .
FGE-1 expression is markedly increased in some sites of chronic immunologic injury , in particular the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) ( 5-8 ) and in allografts undergoing chronic rejection ( 9 , 10 ) where T cell infiltration is common .
Early evidence of a direct connection between T cells and nonhemopoietic growth factors including FGF was first reported by Johnson and Torres ( 11 ) .
Their experiments demonstrated that CD8* T cells produced IFN-y when stimulated by the combination of FGF and TCR engagement by superantigen , while neither stimulus alone induced cytokine production .
Their data thus suggested that FGF and other Departments of Medicine and Microbiology/Immunology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , Nashville , TN 37232 Received for publication November 20 , 1998 .

More recent experiments show that a subset of CD4 * T cells expresses FGF receptor-1 ( FGFR-1 ) ( 12 , 13 ) , a high affinity receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates FGF signaling in many other cell types ( reviewed in Ref .
14 ) .
For CD4* T cells that express FGFR-1 , FGF-1 can provide the costimulatory signal required for IL-2 production in conjunction with anti-CD3 ( 12 , 13 ) .
FGF-1 alone , however , does not induce IL-2 production , and in contrast to other cell types that express FGEFR-1 , FGF-1 alone is unable to induce T cell proliferation .
Whether this reflects the dependence of T cells upon IL-2 for proliferation or differences in FGFR-1 signaling pathways in T cells vs other cell types is unknown .
FGFR signaling in other cell types induces receptor oligomer-ization and autophosphorylation with resultant tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cy and activation of Ras/MAPK/extra-cellular signal-related kinase ( ERK ) ( 14-16 ) , which are also activated by the TCR pathway .
IL-2 production resulting from the combination of TCR and FGF-1 signaling , therefore , presumably reflects an integration of signals from these two pathways and their resultant transcription factor activation .
Among the transcription factors that are activated by signaling through FGFR-1 in nonlym-phoid cells are AP-1 and cAMP response element binding protein/ activating transcription factor-2 ( ATF-2 ) ( 17 , 18 ) , and most recently members of the FGF family were shown , for the first time , to induce NF- « B/Re !
transcription factors in the developing limb bud ( 19 , 20 ) .
Engagement of CD28 by its receptor ligands on APCs is to date the predominant interaction between T cell and APC surface molecules that provide costimulation for IL-2 production , thus inducing T cell expansion and preventing anergy or apoptosis .
Activation of NF- « B/Re ! l factors is a major target of the costimulatory activity of the CD28 pathway ( 21-24 ) .
Indirect evidence suggests 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 5854 that FGF-1 may also have costimulatory function in vivo , especially at sights such as the synovium in active RA and the paren-chyma of solid organ allografts , where FGP-1 production is excessive ( 5 , 7-10 ) .
Patients with RA and cardiac transplant recipients have 5- to 10-fold increases in the precursor frequency of FGF-responsive T cells in peripheral blood compared with normal subjects , and changes in the frequency of these cells over time are correlated with disease activity in RA ( 5 , 12 , 13 ) .
Enrichment of FGFR-1* CD4* T cells in RA synovium compared with peripheral blood suggests that local FGF-1 may contribute to T cell activation , differentiation , or survival within inflammatory sites .
To improve our understanding of the actions on T cells independent of these complex inflammatory events , we initiated studies using a Jurkat T cell line that expresses the signaling isoform of FGFR-1 .
Evidence for activation of NF- « B/Rel transcription factors by FGFs expressed in the developing limb and the parallels with CD28 costimulation in T cells prompted us to investigate whether FGFR-1 signaling activates NF- « B/Rel in Jurkat T cells .
The results show that FGF-1 induces enhanced degradation of cytoplasmic IxB- « and prolonged nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active p50/ReIA heterodimers .
In contrast to costimulation via CD28 , FGF-induced Rel/xB complexes contained low levels of c-Rel , and no binding to the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) was observed in nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with FGE-1 .
The data demonstrate that some functions of FGF-1 outside embryonic development are mediated by members of the Rel/NF- « B family and that signals from a nonhemopoietic growth factor and the TCR pathways may intersect .
The implications for these findings in the activation of nontransformed T cells is discussed .
Materials and Methods Cell culture Jurkat T cells expressing FGFR-18 have been described previously ( 25 ) .
Briefly , they were produced by stable transfection of a plasmid containing FGFR-16 cDNA driven by the CD2 promoter and locus control region .
These cells ( clone C2-14 ) express approximately 30,000 high affinity FGFR and were used for all the experiments described here .
The cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS , 10 mM HEPES , 5 mM L-glutamine , and 1 mg/ml G418 .
For T cell stimulations , cells were cultured in six-well flat-bottom plates coated with anti-CD3 ( 1 pg/ml mAb JE6 , provided by Dr. Stanford Stewart , Vanderbilt University , Nashville , TN ) .
Recombinant human FGF-1 or FGF-2 ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) or anti-CD28 ( mAb 9.3 , 1/2,500 , provided by Dr. Jeffrey Ledbetter , Bristol Myers Squibb , Seattle , WA ) were included as indicated .
All stimulations with FGF-1 or FGF-2 included heparin ( 20 U/ml ) .
For determinations of IL-2 protein production , supernatants were harvested at 24 h and were assayed by ELISA ( BioSource , Camarillo , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's specifications .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extract preparation Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared as previously described ( 26 ) from 10 '' T cells harvested at each time point .
Cells were washed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold PBS , and cell pellets were lysed in 100 ul of lysis buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM KC ] , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 0.4 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mM DTT , and 0.5 mM PMSF ) in the presence of protease inhibitors ( antipain , aprotinin , leupeptin , bestatin , phosphorami-don , and soybean trypsin inhibitor , all 5 pg/ml , and pepstatin 0.5 ug/ml ) .
Cells were incubated on ice for 5 min .
The cell lysates were subsequently centrifuged for 60 s at 14,000 X g , and supernatants were collected for cytoplasmic protein analysis .
The nuclear pellet from lysis was washed briefly in 100 gl of lysis buffer and then subjected to high salt extraction in 50 pl of nuclear buffer ( 0.4 M NaCl , 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and 1 mM PMSF , in the presence of protease inhibitors ) at 4°C with extensive shaking for 15 min .
Cellular debris from both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was removed by cen-trifugation for 10 min at 14,000 X g , and fractions were stored at -70°C until analyzed .
Protein concentrations were determined by spectrophoto-metric assay ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's specifications .
NF- « B ACTIVATION BY FGF-1 EMSA/supershift assays For EMSA , 10 ug of nuclear protein was incubated with °°P-labeled duplex probe including 1 ) a palindromic NF-KB site derived from the IL-2R-a « promoter ( 5-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTITT-3 '' ) ( 27 ) , or 2 ) the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ; 5-GATCGTTITAAA-GAAATTCCAAA-3 ' ) from the IL-2 promoter .
Incubations were performed in binding buffer ( 125 mM NaCl , 2.5 mM EDNA , 0.25 mM DTT , 0.25 mM PMSF , 0.5 mg/ml BSA , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , and 0.1 mg/ml double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) ) for 15 min at room temperature .
Approximately 100,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe was used per sample .
Resultant nu-cleoprotein complexes were separated on a 5 % nondenaturing polyacryl-amide gel in TBE buffer ( 90 mM Tris , 90 mM borate , 2.5 mM EDTA ) and visualized by autoradiography .
For both probes , the specificity of protein-oligonucleotide interactions was verified by competition of radiolabeled probe with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide .
For supershift assays , DNA/protein complexes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antisera to members of the Rel/ « B family , including p65 ( ReIA ) ( antiserum R567 ) ( 26 ) , p50 ( antiserum R393 ) ( 28 ) , or preimmune sera .
Western blot analysis Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from stimulated Jurkat T cells as detailed above .
Nuclear proteins ( 60 pug ) were separated by 10 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene membranes , and blocked with 5 % nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween .
Proteins were subsequently immunoblotted with polyclonal antiserum specific for c-Rel ( antiserum R453 , 1/2000 ) ( 29 ) .
For Western blot analysis of cytosolic IxB , cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared from stimulated Jurkat T cells as detailed above , except that T cells were stimulated in the presence of cycloheximide ( 50 ug/ml ; Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) to block the NF-xB-induced resynthesis of IB inhibitors ( 30 , 31 ) .
Cytoplasmic proteins ( 100 ug ) were separated by 10 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene membranes , and blocked as detailed above .
Proteins were immunoblotted with polyclonal antiserum specific for either IB- « ( antiserum R663 , 1/2500 ) ( 26 ) or IxB-B ( antiserum C-20 , 1/200 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Immunoreactive proteins were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Jurkat transient transfections and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assay Jurkat C2-14 was transiently transfected by electroporation with a vector containing a CAT reporter gene driven by the NF-KB sequence from the HIV-1 promoter as previously described ( 32 ) .
Electroporation conditions ( 250 V , 960 uF , time constant 34 ) were optimized to a viable cell recovery of 50 % .
Cells were rested for 24 h in RPMI/10 % FCS , followed by stimulation for 24 h and assay for CAT activity .
CAT assays were performed on whole cell lysates by a diffusion-based liquid scintillation method ( 33 ) .
Results FGF-1 and FGF-2 act as costimulatory signals for IL-2 production in FGFR-1-expressing T cells Optimal production of IL-2 by T cells is dependent upon signals generated by TCR engagement and costimulatory signals provided by additional cell surface receptors .
To examine the costimulatory effects of FGF-1 , Jurkat T cells that express FGFR-1 were stimulated with anti-CD3 alone , FGF-1 alone , or anti-CD3 plus FGF-1 ( Fig .
1 ) .
Unstimulated T cells and those stimulated with anti-CD3 alone ( zero FGF point on the anti-CD3 plus FGF curve ) or FGF-1 alone produced little IL-2 .
However , the combination of anti-CD3 with FGF-1 increased IL-2 production approximately 7-fold over that with anti-CD3 alone .
Similar results were obtained with FGE-2 ( Fig .
1 ) , consistent with the fact that FGFR-1 binds both these FGF family members with high affinity .
Positive control stimulations with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 resulted in significant IL-2 production ( mean , 1423 pg/ml ; data not shown ) .
These data confirm previous findings that engagement of the TCR together with stimulation by FGF-1 induces both IL-2 production and proliferation , whereas FGF-1 alone is ineffective ( 12 , 13 ) .

FGF-1 and FGF-2 provide costimulatory signals for IL-2 production in FGFR-1* T cells .
FGFR-1-transfected Jurkat cells ( subline C2-14 ) were plated at 1 X 10 % /ml and stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 , FGPF-1 ( 50 ng/ml ) , or increasing concentrations of FGF-1 or FGF-2 ( 0-100 ng/m ! )
in the presence of anti-CD3 as described in Materials and Methods .
Cells were harvested after 24-h incubation at 37°C , and supernatants were assayed for IL-2 by ELISA .
Results are expressed as the mean IL-2 production from three separate experiments .
Positive control stimulations with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 resulted in IL-2 production with a mean of 1423 pg/ml ( data not shown ) .
FGF-1 stimulation induces nuclear translocation of « kB binding proteins Activation of T cells via the TCR together with costimulation via CD28 result in nuclear translocation of Rel/NF- « B transcription factors ( 23 , 34 ) .
We therefore examined whether FGF-1 alone or in combination with TCR engagement similarly activates NF-KB .
Gel shifts were performed using a palindromic B sequence derived from the IL-2R -chain enhancer as a probe and nuclear extracts from cells that were either unstimulated or stimulated with FGF-1 alone ( Fig .
2A ) .
Modest induction of NF-KB binding activity was present by 30 min after addition of FGF-1 and remained detectable with relatively little change during 6 h of culture in the presence of FGE-1 .
In contrast , stimulation with both anti-CD3 and FGF-1 led to enhanced binding compared with either stimulus alone , and binding activity increased substantially over time up to 12 h in culture ( Fig .
2B ) .
As a positive control for NF- « B/Re ! l activation , we performed EMSA on T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and detected a similar kB binding complex ( Fig .
2B ) .
Competition experiments with unlabeled competitor probe confirmed the specificity of binding ( data not shown ) .
To confirm binding by NF- « B family members , supershifts were performed with antisera to p50 and p65 and with control nonimmune serum on nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone , anti-CD3 plus FGF-1 , and positive controls stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ( Fig .
2C ) .
The results demonstrate the presence of p50 and p65 in all complexes binding to the « B sequence .
The data thus indicate that stimulation by FGF-1 results in nuclear translocation of NF-KB that is enhanced by the combination of TCR and FGEFR signaling .
FGF-1 costimulation does not result in increased nuclear translocation of c-Rel As supershift assays using polyclonal antiserum directed against c-Rel did not produce convincing mobility shifts ( data not shown ) , we performed Western blotting for c-Rel using nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 plus either FGEF-1 or anti-CD28 ( Fig .
3 ) .
The results demonstrate no appreciable in 5855 crease in c-Rel nuclear translocation following stimulation with FGE-1 alone or anti-CD3 alone and a very modest increase in c-Rel following stimulation with anti-CD3 plus FGEF-1 .
In contrast , marked nuclear translocation of c-Rel was noted following stimulation with anti-CD3 in combination with anti-CD28 .
These data show that FGF-induced Rel/kB complexes differ from those activated by anti-CD28 pathways , as FGF-induced complexes contain little c-Rel .
FGF-1 costimulation does not induce nuclear translocation of proteins that bind to the CD28 response element Activation through CD28 , but not other costimulators ( 23 ) , results in the formation of a nuclear CD28 response complex ( CD28RC ) that binds to a sequence designated the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) present in several genes including the IL-2 promoter ( 23 , 35 , 36 ) .
Since FGF-1 costimulation enhances nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 , which are components of the CD28RC ( 23 ) , we examined whether it also results in a complex that binds the CD28RE .
EMSA was performed with a probe for the CD28RE sequence and nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with FGF-1 alone in combination with anti-CD3 or from controls stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ( Fig .
4 ) .
Nuclear extracts from controls stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 showed the expected binding to the CD28RE probe , while cells stimulated with FGE-1 , anti-CD28 alone , anti-CD3 alone , or anti-CD3 plus FGF-1 did not .
These results indicate that costimulation by FGF-1 does not activate formation of the protein complex that binds this element of the IL-2 promoter and that signaling pathways from CD28 and FGFR-1 are not identical .
NF-KB proteins activated by FGF-1 costimulation are transcriptionally active To confirm that the « B binding complex induced by FGF-1 costimulation was capable of activating transcription , we performed transient transfections with an NF- « B-CAT reporter construct .
As shown in Fig .
5 , stimulation with either anti-CD3 or FGF-1 alone resulted in only a 2-fold increase in CAT activity above that in unstimulated cells .
Costimulation with FGF-1 and anti-CD3 resulted in an average 5-fold increase in CAT activity , similar to the 7 .
A-fold increase seen with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 .
The results demonstrate that both FGF-1 and CD28 costimulatory pathways induce Rel/kB protein complexes that are transcriptionally active .
Costimulation with FGF-1 targets IxB-a for degradation Rel/NF- « B proteins are retained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by inhibitors ( IB ) that prevent their nuclear translocation ( 30 , 31 , 37 ) .
Activating signals result in phosphorylation of these inhibitors and their subsequent degradation ( 30 , 31 ) .
Costimulation via CD28 has been reported to induce degradation of both I « B-a ( 38 , 39 ) and IxB- $ B ( 34 ) .
To determine whether FGF-1 stimulation similarly results in degradation of IB , Western blots were performed for IxB-a and IxB-f on cytoplasmic extracts of cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone or anti-CD3 plus FGF-1 .
Because active NF-kB induces synthesis of protein ( 30 ) , cycloheximide was added to cultures to prevent new protein synthesis and therefore the resynthesis of IKxB-a @ induced by active NF- « B .
The results are shown in Fig .
6 .
Compared with stimulation with anti-CD3 alone , costimulation with FGE-1 resulted in enhanced degradation of IkB-a with earlier kinetics .
Decreased levels of IxB-a were apparent by 30 min of stimulation , and degradation was virtually complete by 4 h ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , no degradation of IxB-B was seen .
Similar results were observed for degradation of IkB-a following costimulation with anti-CD28 .

Discussion Signals delivered through FGFRs provide costimulatory pathways in a subset of T lymphocytes and may contribute to T cell activation at inflammatory lesions characterized by abundant FGP-1 expression ( 5 , 12 , 13 ) .
While the activation pathways in T cells following engagement of FGFR tyrosine kinases have yet to be fully elucidated , recent data have clarified FGF signaling pathways in nonhemopoietic cells .
In NIH-3T3 cells , binding of FGF-1 to FGEFR-1 results in receptor autophosphorylation on six tyrosine residues , including residues that are crucial for functional kinase activity in the catalytic domain ( Y¥653 , Y¥654 ) , and additional residues ( Y¥766 ) that are required for the recruitment of various signaling intermediates ( 14 , 16 , 40 ) .
These autophosphorylation events trigger the recruitment of SH2 domain proteins , including phospholipase Cy , Grb2 , and Sos ( 16 ) .
Recruitment of such SH2 domain proteins then triggers the activation of Ras-dependent signaling events and the induction of MAPK pathways ( 16 , 41 ) .
It is not known whether autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues out CD3 CD3 unstim FGF1 CD28 CD3 +FGF1 + CD28 .

side the catalytic domain is required for FGFR-1 signaling , as site-directed mutagenesis of these noncatalytic tyrosine residues does not inhibit activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway or cell proliferation ( 40 ) .
In addition , the data suggest that FGF downstream signaling events are shared with cAMP pathways , as FGF/Ras-me-diated gene activation in neuroblastoma cells has been shown to induce transcription of the ATFE/AP-1 factors c-Jun and ATE-3 , which , in turn , bind to cAMP response element-2 ( 18 ) .
These data demonstrating induction of Fos and Jun proteins are consistent with the observation that FGF-2 induces the expression of c-Jun and c-Fos in NIH-3T3 cells ( 17 ) , and that the FGF-inducible response element from the syndecan gene contains novel AP-1 binding motifs ( 41 ) .
The data presented here are , to the best of our knowledge , the first direct demonstration of Rel/kB activation following interaction of FGF-1 with FGFR-1 .

5858 examining expression of NF-KB in the mesoderm of developing chick limb bud have demonstrated a relationship between other FGFs and activation of NF- « B proteins .
In both studies either ex-ogenous FGF-8 ( 19 ) or FGF-4 ( 20 ) was capable of reconstituting c-Rel mesodermal expression and normal limb formation following excision of the apical ectodermal ridge , a known source of FGFs that regulate limb development ( 19 , 20 ) .
The induction of other proteins , such as p50 or p65 , was not addressed in these reports , and activation of an intermediary protein remains a possibility .
Nonetheless , taken together , the data suggest that FGEFRs in both Jurkat T cells and mesoderm directly activate Rel/kB .
It is not evident from the studies in chick limb which FGFRs mediate c-Rel activation ; however , previous investigations have shown that functional FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 are required for normal limb development in vertebrates ( 42 , 43 ) .
In Jurkat cells , we were unable to demonstrate substantial c-Rel activation by FGE-1 and FGFR-1 .
The results may suggest that FGF family members and distinct FGFRs differentially regulate NF- « B/Rel proteins .
In addition , nontransformed T cells that express FGFR-1 , such as those in RA synovium ( 5 ) , may be regulated differently .
While the function of FGF-1 as a secondary signal for T cell activation is analogous to costimulation through CD28 pathways , our data indicate that these two pathways are distinct .
The failure of FGF-1-induced nuclear proteins to bind with high affinity to the CD28RE coupled with the minimal c-Rel in these complexes indicate that the Rel/kB complexes are not identical in FGF-1 and CD28 pathways .
Recent data show that while RelA ( p65 ) , NF- « B1 ( p50 ) , and c-Rel are all components of the CD28RC , only RelA and c-Rel directly bind to and trans-activate the CD28RE ( 22 , 24 ) .
In addition , the induction of c-Rel by CD28 appears to be a critical determinant of CD28RE transcriptional activity , as overexpression of c-rel augments the activity of a reporter gene under the control of the CD28RE ( 23 ) .
In Jurkat T cells we have not been able to demonstrate the presence of substantial c-Rel in FGF-1-induced complexes , and this lack of c-Rel activation may provide one explanation for the relatively weak transcriptional activity of FGF-induced complexes and their inability to bind to the CD28RE .
Finally , recent evidence suggests that CD28 costimulation and subsequent activation of the CD28RE requires binding of factors unrelated to Rel/xB proteins , including the high mobility group protein HMG I ( Y ) ( 44 ) , and NF-MATp35 ( 45 ) .
Such proteins may not be recruited in response to FGF-1 signaling in T cells .
These events may differ in other types of T cells , such that FGF-1 costimulation in nontransformed T cells in vitro or its effects within inflammatory sites may include c-Rel activation .
Experiments are currently in progress to determine these possibilities .
Similarly , we have observed that the combination of FGF-1 and anti-CD28 increases NF-KB translocation in Jurkat without increasing IL-2 production ( data not shown ) .
The outcome of these signals may also differ in nontransformed T cells , and experiments to characterize these events are in progress .
Differential degradation of the NF-KB cytoplasmic inhibitors IxB-a and IxB-B was examined to determine how FGF-1 regulates the induction of Rel/kB complexes .
Emerging data suggest that control of differential complex induction by various stimuli occurs at the level of targeted degradation of either IxB-a @ or IxB- $ B .
Degradation of I « B-a @ has been linked to the nuclear induction of p50/p65 heterodimers , the classic NF-kB complexes induced by a broad variety of stimuli , including mitogens ( PMA ) and various cytokines ( GM-CSF , TNF-a ) ( 34 ) .
In contrast , targeted degradation of IxB-B is restricted to only a few stimulators , including LPS and the human T cell leukemia virus-1 Tax protein ( 34 ) .
CD28 signaling targets both a and B isoforms , as this pathway has been recently shown to prolong both PMA- and anti-CD3 NF- « B ACTIVATION BY FGF-1 induced degradation of IxB-a @ and to induce the degradation of an event that is not targeted by PMA activation alone ( 34 , 38 , 39 ) .
Our results show that FGF-1 targets the degradation of as FGF-1 plus anti-CD3 enhances and substantially prolongs the modest IxB-a degradation induced by anti-CD3 alone .
Little effect on I « B- B degradation was observed in our studies .
This FGF-1 targeting of IxB- « is consistent with the FGF-1 induction of Rel/kB complexes that contain mostly p50 and p65 , the heterodimer complex that is typically induced with degradation .
While we demonstrate activation of Rel/kB proteins following FGE-1/FGFR-1 interaction , this could be a response unique to specific combinations of FGFs/FGFRs rather than the FGF family as a whole .
Recent studies in NIH-3T3 cells suggest that an FGP-2-inducible response element in the syndecan-1 promoter does not bind NF- « B ( 41 ) .
In these studies in vivo footprinting revealed three motifs that bind nuclear factors in response to FGF-2 activation .
While two of these motifs contained AP-1-like consensus sites , the remaining motif contained no known consensus se-quences .
Binding competition experiments with an array of unlabeled oligonucleotides in gel-shift experiments did not reveal inhibition of any protein complexes by NF- « B oligonucleotides , suggesting that Rel/kB proteins are not crucial for the FGF-2-responsive expression of syndecan-1 ( 41 ) .
Thus , while NF- « B is activated by FGE-1 in Jurkat T cells , it is likely that other proteins play critical roles in the transcriptional regulation of FGF-1-responsive elements in other types of cells .
In addition , the complex array of cytokines and growth factors found in inflammatory sites where FGFR-1* T cells accumulate may further alter the transcriptional regulation of FGF-1 responses .
