The ability of T cells to form high intracellular levels of cAMP is acquired during development in the human thymus and is retained by the majority of mature peripheral T lymphocytes .
Here we show that elevated cAMP levels in T cells correlate with the expression of the potent transcriptional repressor ICER ( inducible cAMP early repressor ) previously described in the hypothalamic , pituitary-gonadal axis .
Further , in transcriptional assays in vivo , ICER inhibits calcineurin-mediated expression of the interleukin 2 promoter as well as Tax-mediated transactivation of the human T-lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-1D ) promoter .
Thus , the induction of ICER in T cells may play an important role in the cAMP-induced quiescence and the persistent latency of HTLV-I .
The inhibitory effects of the second messenger cAMP on T-cell proliferation and effector functions are well recognized ( 1 ) .
However , little is known about the mechanisms by which the inhibitory effects occur .
Recently , a novel cA MP-inducible transcriptional repressor protein has been described ( 2 , 3 ) .
This transrepressor , ICER , is expressed in neuroendocrine tissues such as the pineal , pituitary ( 2 , 3 ) , and thyroid ( 4 ) glands under rhythmic , circadian control .
ICER binds to cAMP response elements ( CREs ) that diverge considerably from the canonical CRE motif , TGACGTCA , and thereby inhibits CRE-binding transactivator proteins .
These CREs include the cAMP autoregulatory response elements located in the promoter of the ICER gene .
The expression of the ICER gene is stimulated by cA MP -activated transcription factors and is then repressed by negative autoregulatory feedback , thereby establishing a circadian control of ICER gene expression .
Because of the known circadian fluctuations in the proliferation and activities of lymphocytes ( 5 , 6 ) , we sought to determine whether high levels of intracellular cAMP in developing T lymphocytes could induce the expression of ICER and so implicate a potential role for ICER in the observed inhibitory effects of cAMP on mature T cells ( 1 ) .
Here we report that prostaglandin E ; ( PGE ) and forskolin , known agonists for cAMP signaling , rapidly induce ICER mRNA in human medullary thymocytes and mature peripheral blood T lymphocytes , but not in immature cortical thymocytes or peripheral B lymphocytes .
Further , we show that in transfection expression experiments in vivo , ICER inhibits the transactivation of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter as well as the promoter for the human T-cell-specific lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) .
Inasmuch as IL-2 is critical for the proliferation of T cells , these findings suggest that the induction of the ICER may be a mechanism to explain the antiproliferative effects of cAMP signaling on T cells .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Human Thymocytes and Peripheral Blood T and B Lymphocytes .
Human thymus glands were obtained from children ( ages 3 months to 4 years ) undergoing corrective cardiac surgery .
Thymocytes were fractionated over discontinuous Percoll gradients ( Pharmacia ) ( 7 ) .
Cells with densities of 1.060 < o < 1.070 and P > 1.070 were collected and classified into large and small cells , respectively .
Cell size profiles were determined on a FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) using a linear scale .
Cell surface staining and flow cytometry was performed ( 8 ) , with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated monoclonal antibody anti-CD3 ( UCHT1 , Immunotech , Westbrook , ME ) , anti-CD4-PE ( MT310 , Dako ) , or anti-CD8-FITC ( SK1 , Becton Dickinson ) .
Buffy-coat leukocytes were obtained from healthy adult blood donors , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by using Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia ) .
Monocytes were depleted by adherence to plastic , 2 X 45 min in RPMI 1640 medium ( GIBCO/BRL ) at 37°C .
Recovered cells were depleted of B cells by using magnetic cell sorting ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotec , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Staining with anti-CD19-microbeads and separations on MACS columns were performed according to manufacturer 's instructions , except that the buffer used was RPMI 1640 medium with 1.0 % bovine serum albumin .
The T-cell-enriched populations typically contained less than 4 % CD20*B cells , less than 3 % CD14* monocytes , and 15-23 % CD16* natural killer cells , as revealed by flow cytometry ( data not shown ) .
cAMP Assay .
To measure cAMP formation , cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of agonists and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with 1.0 % bovine serum albumin .
Measurements of intracellular cAMP concentrations were performed according to established procedures ( 9 ) .
Error bars represent standard deviations of average values calculated from three or more independent experiments .
Reverse Transcription ( RT ) -PCR Cloning and Sequencing .
Human Jurkat T cells induced by 0.1 mM forskolin were harvested 3 h post-induction .
Total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR .
The sequences of the 5 and 3 ' primers were : 5-ATG GCT GTA ACT GGA GAT GAA ACT-3 ' and 5'-CTA ATC TGT TTT GGG AGA GCA AAT GTC-3 ' , respectively .
The 5 ' and 3 ' primers were selected to begin with the start codon ( ATG ) and stop codon ( antisense CTA ) , Abbreviations : ICER , inducible cAMP early repressor ; IL-2 , interleukin 2 ; HTLV-I , human T-lymphotropic virus type I ; PGE ; , prostaglandin E ; ; PBL , peripheral blood lymphocyte ; bZIP , basic leucine zipper ; PKA , protein kinase A ; CRE , cAMP response element ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( `` 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate '' ) .

RT-PCR cloning and sequencing were performed by using standard procedures ( 10 ) .
RNase Protection Analysis .
RNA extraction was performed as described ( 10 ) .
RNA probe 1 is generated from pCREM-hRIBO3 by BamHI digestion and in vitro transcription .
RNA probe 2 was prepared from pJL5 by Xho I digestion and corresponds to full-length cDNA of human ICER II .
In the data described in Fig .
3B , an RNA probe complementary to human a-globin was included with the ICER RNA probe to serve as an internal control .
RNA probes , uniformly labeled with [ « - > °P ] JCTP , were prepared by using reagents from an RNA probe kit ( Ambion ) .
These probes were used for RNase protection studies , according to the protocol provided by Ambion ( RPAII Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit ) .
X-ray films were scanned and evaluated by densitometry with ImaAGE-QUANT ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Results have been reproduced in several independent experiments .
Immunocytochemistry .
Jurkat T cells were treated with forskolin ( 0.1 mM ) , attached to slides after 24 h by using a micro-cytocentrifuge ( StatSpin , Norwood , MA ) , and fixed for 5 ' in 4 % paraformaldehyde in saline .
Immunocytochemistry was performed by using Vectastain horseradish peroxidase ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories ) .
The ICER -specific antiserum , used for immunocytochemical staining , was raised in a guinea pig ( Hazelton Research Products , Denver , PA ) against an ICER-specific peptide ( Ala-Val-Thr-Gly-Asp-Glu-Thr-Gly-Gly-Cys ) ( see Fig .
24 ) , conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin .
Transient Overexpression in Jurkat T Cells .
Transfection assays were performed by the DEAE-dextran technique .
Typ-ically , 10 '' Jurkat cells were transfected with 2 ug of the reporter and the same amount of Tax or protein kinase A ( PKA ) expression vectors .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays and quantification methods are described elsewhere ( 11 ) .
The percent conversion of [ '*CJchloramphenicol to its acetylated forms ( Ac ) was quantified by using a Betagen Betascope ( Mountain View , CA ) .
The results shown here are representative of a series of several independent experiments .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Maturation of PKA Pathway During T-Cell Development in Human Thymus .
Thymus glands were obtained from children undergoing corrective heart surgery , and thymocytes were separated by centrifugation through Percoll gradients ( 7 ) .
Fractionated thymocytes consisted of either small , immature cortical cells ( Fig .
1 A-C ) , or large cells , containing mature medullary or CD4~8* thymocytes ( Fig .
1 4 , B , and D ) ( 12 ) .
To examine their differences , these fractionated cells were treated with the adenylyl cyclase agonists forskolin or PGE ; within 12 h of obtaining the thymus gland .
Both agonists caused a striking elevation of cAMP levels in medullary thymocytes , but relatively low elevations in small cortical thymocytes ( Fig .
1 E and F ) .
PGE ; or forskolin also markedly stimulated cAMP levels in mature PBL T cells , whereas little or no response was observed in B cells ( Fig .
1 G and H ) .
These large differences in the responses of separated thymocytes led us to examine whether the elevations of cAMP that are measured in medullary thymocytes and mature PBL T cells could be sufficient to induce the transcriptional repressor ICER .
Human ICER Sequence Is Highly Conserved .
To test whether elevated levels of intracellular cAMP in medullary thymocytes induce ICER , all four isoforms of human ICER were cloned by RT-PCR from forskolin-treated human Jurkat T cells and were sequenced ( Fig .
2 ) .
Alignment of the human and mouse sequences of ICER II shows a high degree of conservation at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels , particularly in the bZIP domains ( Fig .
2B ) .

( 4 ) Schematic representation of the CREM gene .
The alternative P1 and cAMP-responsive P2 promoters are depicted by arrows .
The BRLZa corresponds to the DNA-binding domain basic leucine zipper bZIP I ( CREB-like ) , and BRLZb corresponds to bZIP II ( CREM-like ) .
The phosphorylation domain ( P-box ) and Q-rich domains are indicated .
RNA splicing generates the four isoforms of ICER , with alternatively spliced exons encoding the DNA-binding bZIP domains ( ICER I or ICER II containing exons Ia or Ib , respectively ) and the amino proximal y exon ( ICER I and ICER II containing y exon , and ICER Iy and ICER IIy lacking the y exon ) .
All four isoforms of ICER are schematically represented below .
( B ) Alignment of human and mouse homologues of ICER II cDNAs .
Upper numbers in the margins refer to adjacent nucleotides ; lower numbers in the margin are amino acids .
The +1 corresponds to A of the ATG initiation codon .
Single-point nucleotide substitutions outside of the bZIP II domain yielded three amino acid changes between human and mouse homologues in positions Glu ' 3-Asp , Arg* '' -GIn , and Ala*®-Thr , framed in squares .
The cDNA sequences of the three other human ICER isoforms that were cloned and sequenced from human Jurkat T cells ( ICER IIy , ICER I , and ICER Iy ) are not shown .
strong ICER IIy and weaker ICER II-specific mRNA signals with the human ICER II RNA probe ( probe 2 ) ( Fig .
3 4 and B ) .
Notably , no significant forskolin-mediated induction of ICER mRNA was detected in either cortical thymocytes or unfractionated ( total ) human thymocytes ( Fig .
3B ) .
These findings correlate with the differences in cAMP levels observed after treating medullary and cortical thymocytes with forskolin ( Fig .
1F ) and confirm that ICER induction can be detected only in a subset of mature medullary thymocytes .
Of importance is that ICER is transcribed and translated exclusively from an internal promoter ( P2 ) whose activity is stimulated by cAMP-responsive autoregulatory enhancers ( 3 ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
To confirm that ICER is the only CREM isoform induced in thymocytes and that the constitutive P1 promoter is not used , a human CREMy probe ( probe 1 ) that contains exons from the 5 ' portion of the CREM gene upstream of the ICER -specific P2 promoter was used in the RNase protection assays ( Fig .
3 4 and C ) .
The length of protected ICER IIy fragment by the CREM y probe corresponded exactly to that observed with the ICER II RNA probe , indicating the absence of 5 sequences ( P1 promoter induced ) upstream of the P2 promoter in forskolin-induced CREM transcripts ( Fig .
3C ) .
These results demonstrate that ICER Hy is the prevalent CREM isoform in the forskolin-treated Jurkat leukemic T-cell line ( Fig .
3 B and C ) .
Autoregulatory Inhibition of ICER in T Cells .
Since ICER expressed in medullary thymocytes , as well as in Jurkat cells , specifically uses the cAMP-responsive P2 promoter in the human CREM gene , we questioned whether an autoregulatory loop , similar to that described in the pineal and pituitary glands Medical Sciences : Bodor et al .

The DNA-binding domains and the phosphorylated region ( P-box ) are indicated .
The extent of partially protected probes obtained during the RNase protection analysis is indicated by horizontal bars .
Probe 1 corresponds to human CREMy ( 13 ) , initiated at the P1 promoter .
Probe 2 corresponds to human ICER II , initiated at the P2 promoter .
The sizes in nucleotides of the protected RNA are indicated .
( B ) RNase protection analysis of total RNA from medullary , cortical , or total thymocytes treated with forskolin for the times indicated ( lanes 4-15 ) , and total RNA from Jurkat cells after 3 h of forskolin treatment ( lane 16 ) .
The sizes of the bands , corresponding to specific ICER-protected fragments , are shown ( nt ) .
Asterisks denote nonspecific background bands .
The bands of 363 nt and 302 nt correspond to ICER II and ICER IIy , respectively ; both contain the bZIP II domain .
Probe 2 ( 402 nt ) ( lane 1 ) and internal probe of a-globin ( 270 nt ) ( lane 2 ) did not yield any detectable signal with tRNA ( lane 3 ) .
The band of 133 nt corresponds to the protected fragment of the a-globin probe .
The enhancement of the 270-nt « -globin band in the total thymocyte RNA 1 h after treatment with forskolin is unexplained .
( C ) ICER expression is induced specifically by the cAMP signal transduction pathway .
ICER expression following 6 h of treatment was scored with probe 1 ( lane 1 ) in untreated Jurkat cells ( 0 ; lane 2 ) or Jurkat cells treated with 0.1 mM forskolin ( FSK ; lane 3 ) , 10 ug/ml PMA ( lane 4 ) , 10 ug/ml cycloheximide ( CHX ; lane 5 ) , or cycloheximide in combination with forskolin ( FSK + CHX ; lane 6 ) , 10~ '' M dexamethasone ( DEX ; lane 7 ) , and 10 ug/ml phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( lane 8 ) .
ICER expression is induced only upon stimulation of the cAMP pathway by forskolin ( lane 3 ) , or after co-treatment with cycloheximide , which resulted in superinduction ( lane 6 ) .
No products corresponding to utilization of the P1 promoter were detected .
( D ) Immediate , early ICER expression is specifically induced in T-cell lines , but not in B-cell lines .
RNase protection analysis of ICER expression ( probe 2 ) in five different T-cell lines and two different B-cell lines , either untreated or after 3 h of forskolin treatment , shows induction of ICER IIy ( 302 nt ) and ICER II ( 363 nt ) in Jurkat cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , MOLT3 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , MOLT4 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , HUT78 ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , and CEM ( lanes 9 and 10 ) .
ICER induction was only faintly detectable under these conditions in the B-cell lines X-50-7 ( 11 ) ( lanes 11 and 12 ) , and AKATA ( 12 ) ( lanes 13 and 14 ) .
T-cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection .
( £ ) ICER expression in PBL T cells is downregulated by forskolin ( 0.1 mM ) , but upregulated by PGE ; ( 500 ng/ml ) .
After 1 h , forskolin ( lane 2 ) or PGE ; ( lane 5 ) caused significant diminution or enhancement of ICER expression in PBL T cells , respectively .
A significant shift from ICER II ( 302 and 363 nt ) to ICER I ( 227 and 166 nt ) isoforms was also observed after PGE » treatment .
ICER expression was scored by RNase protection analysis using probe 2 .
Equal loading and quality of RNA were monitored cither by using human a-globin as an internal probe ( protected fragment 133 nt ) ( 14 ) or by G6PD RT-PCR controls ( 15 ) .
These results are representative of a series of many experiments .

- ICER expression in T cells .
Immunocytochemical analysis of forskolin-treated Jurkat T cells after 24 h of treatment with forskolin reveals intense staining in nuclei with ICER-specific antiserum , but no detectable staining with pre-immune serum .
Jurkat T cells were treated with forskolin ( 0.1 mM ) and attached to slides after 24 h. Immunocytochemistry was performed with ICER specific antiserum raised in guinea pigs against a synthetic ICER-specific peptide ( Ala-Val-Thr-Gly-Asp-Glu-Thr-Gly-Gly-Cys ) ( see Fig .
24 ) using horseradish peroxidase .
Preabsorption of ICER-specific antisera with the ICER peptide ( 100 ug/m ! )
abolished the immunostaining ( data not shown ) .
of rodents ( 2 , 3 ) , results from ICER binding to its own promoter in human T cells .
The specificity of the cAMP signaling pathway in the induction of the P2 promoter in T cells was therefore examined .
Activation of signal transduction pathways other than the cAMP pathway by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , dexamethasone , or phytohemagglutinin , did not induce ICER mRNAs ( Fig .
3C ) .
However , the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide markedly potentiated the forskolin-induced elevation of ICER mRNA ( FSK+CHX ) ( Fig .
3C ) .
These findings suggest that the inhibition of ICER synthesis by cycloheximide in T cells renders ICER unavailable for binding to the P2 promoter , and are consistent with autoregulatory inhibition , as described in the rodent model ( 3 ) .
ICER Is Expressed Preferentially in T Cells .
Induction of immediate , early expression of ICER mRNA after 3 h of forskolin treatment was detected in all five human T-cell lines tested ( Jurkat , MOLT-3 , MOLT-4 , HUT78 , and CEM ) , whereas ICER was only faintly detectable in the B-cell lines ( X-50-7 and AKATA ) ( Fig .
3D ) .
This suggests an immediate , early T-cell preferential expression of ICER .
Moreover , a marked increase of ICER mRNA levels was observed in Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 93 ( 1996 ) purified human PBL T cells in response to PGE , ( Fig .
3€ , lane 5 ) .
Notably , a shift in the prevalence of isoforms was observed : ICER II and ICER IIy shifted to ICER Iy and , to a lesser extent , to ICER I .
In these mature PBL T cells , a forskolin-mediated inhibition of ICER mRNA levels is consistent with the mechanism of autoregulatory inhibition of the P2 promoter ( Fig .
3E , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The relatively high levels of ICER mRNA observed in untreated , purified PBL T cells may be either a consequence of the activation of cAMP signaling pathways during the preparation of T lymphocytes , or may reflect a normal physiologic property of resting PBL T cells .
This conjecture correlates with the elevated basal levels of cAMP observed before the addition of PGE ; or forskolin ( note the difference in zero time points in Fig .
1 E and G ) .
A further activation of the cAMP pathway by forskolin is predicted to repress ICER mRNA levels via the negative autoregulatory actions of the ICER repressor of the P2 promoter .
The inducibility of the ICER promoter under physiological conditions in vitro suggests an important role of ICER in T-cell functions in vivo .
The specific expression of ICER protein , directed by the cAMP-responsive P2 promoter in T cells , is further supported by in sity immunocytochemical analysis of Jurkat cells ( Fig .
4 ) with an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the ICER-specific exon ( Fig .
2 ) and is present in ICER , but not other CREM proteins .
Detection of ICER after 24 h of forskolin treatment indicates a relatively high stability of the protein expressed in the T cells .
ICER Inhibits Calcineurin-Mediated IL-2 Expression .
PGE ; is one of the numerous physiologic inhibitors of T-cell proliferation that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP ( 16 , 17 ) .
PGE ; is also known to inhibit IL-2 expression in T cells by counteracting calcineurin-dependent activation of the IL-2 promoter , mediated by the cooperative interactions of transcription factors NFAT and the Fos/Jun ( AP-1 ) complex ( 18-20 ) .
To determine whether ICER expression could supplant the effect of PGE ; in the downregulation of the activated IL-2 promoter , ICER II , and , as a control , a DNA-binding deficient mutated ICER II without the leucine zipper ( ICER II LZ~ ) , were expressed in Jurkat T cells in transient transfection assays .
Expression of ICER II downregulated the human IL-2 promoter activated by the combined treatment of the cells with ionomycin and PMA ( PMA+1I ) , a treatment known to activate the calcineurin-dependent signal pathway ( 18 ) , whereas expression of the mutated ICER II LZ~ had little effect on activation ( Fig .
54 ) .

( 4 ) Jurkat cells were transfected with either the human IL-2-CAT reporter ( 20 ) or with the HTLV-I LTR-CAT ( CR-CAT ) reporter ( B and C ) ( 21 ) .
To activate the calcineurin-dependent signal pathway , Jurkat cells were treated with PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )
and ionomycin ( 1 ug/ml ) 16 h posttransfection ( PMA+1 ) ; to induce the HTLV-I promoter , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with an expression vector of Tax ( 21 ) ( B ) , or with an expression vector of the catalytic subunit of PKA ( 22 ) ( C ) .
Co-transfection with 2 , 4 , or 8 ug of the ICER II expression vector ( pKWJL5 ) represses promoter activation ( A and B , lanes 3 , 5 , and 7 , respectively ) .
No comparable repression can be seen with the DNA-binding deficient ICER mutant , ICER II LZ~-expression vector in parallel transfections using the same amounts of DNA ( 4 and B , lanes 4 , 6 , and 8 ) .
( C ) PKA activated CR-CAT reporter ( lane 2 ) is almost completely repressed by 2 ug of ICER II ( lane 3 ) .
To confirm the specificity of ICER inhibition , pGI2 ( 3XGAL4 ) -CAT reporter ( 23 ) was transactivated by the GAL4VP16 ( 24 ) in combination with ICER II and ICER II LZ~ expression vectors .
No significant inhibition in transient transfections with any of the above-mentioned plasmids was observed ( data not shown ) .

lation of the calcineurin-dependent , NFAT/AP-1-mediated transactivation of the IL-2 promoter , when induced by PMA and ionomycin .
Although transcription factors other than ICER may contribute to the inhibition of IL-2 expression by cAMP generating agogists , the data presented here support the idea that ICER is a negative regulator of IL-2 gene transcription .
The similarities between the bZIP domains of ICER and Fos/Jun suggests the possibility that ICER may interfere with Fos/Jun in the NFAT complex , and so inhibit activation of the IL-2 promoter .
ICER Downregulates Tax-Mediated HTLV-I Expression .
The Tax protein encoded by HTLV-I has been shown to enhance the binding of the bZIP transcription factors ( 25 ) , such as the strongly cAMP-responsive transactivator CREB ( 26 ) , to CRE-like sequences in the 21-bp repeats contained in the promoter of HTLV-I .
These observations suggest a role for ICER in HTLV-I-infected T cells .
Therefore , we examined whether the expression of ICER would inhibit HTLV-I promoter activity .
Indeed , in transcriptional assays , in vivo expression of ICER II effectively downregulates both Tax- and PKA-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I promoter ( Fig .
5 B and C ) .
The results of our studies suggest that the induction of ICER by cAMP signaling is a potentially important mechanism in the down regulation of certain genes in response to cAMP .
cAMP is known to inhibit pathways upstream of transcription , e.g. , cAMP-dependent phosphorylation inacti-vates Raf-1 ( 27 ) .
We suggest , however , that ICER could be a dominant transcriptional repressor in T cells and thus , under certain circumstances , override effects on transcription mediated by other upstream pathways .
The findings that the expression of ICER in T cells downregulates the IL-2 and HTLV-I promoters provides a potential link between the quiescent state of T cells and the persistent latency of HTLV-I .
Note Added in Proof .
It has been reported recently ( 28 ) that the targeted expression of a dominant negative isoform of the CRE binding protein to thymocytes of transgenic mice results in a profound proliferative defect characterized by a markedly decreased IL-2 pro-duction .
