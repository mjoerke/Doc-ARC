In addition , both heat and cadmium produced an increase in the amount of the intermediate filament protein vimentin , as determined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays .
By contrast , the amounts of actin and B-tubulin were not significantly altered .
The amount of vimentin mRNA was also increased during recovery from stress , indicating that vimentin expression was not exclusively regulated at the protein level .
Although cadmium caused an early , transient stimu- lation of c-jun and c-fos expression and AP-1 binding activity , heat-shock failed to alter both protooncogene expression and transcription factor binding , indicating that the stress-induced vimentin increase was not the result of AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation .
Finally , it was observed that the rate of decay of vimentin mRNA upon actinomycin D administration was decreased in heat- and cadmium-pretreated cells in comparison to untreated cells .
These results indicate that stress treatments cause an increase in vimentin levels in promonocytic cells , which may be explained at least in part by transcript stabilization .
Key words : Vimentin , Heat-shock , Cadmium , Promonocytic cell INTRODUCTION A common response of all living organisms to abnormally high temperatures or other environmental or metabolic insults is the stimulation of the expression of a group of proteins termed heat-shock proteins ( HSPs ) , which may serve to protect the cells from the lethal consequences of stress ( Lindquist and Craig , 1988 ) .
The stress response is accompanied by other cellular phenomena which include the inhibition of the expression of normally synthesized proteins ( Lindquist , 1986 ) , the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation ( Roti Roti et al. , 1992 ) and the induction of apoptosis ( Sikora et al. , 1993 ) .
One of the best known morphological effects of heat-shock is the production of alterations in the cytoskeleton structure .
For instance , it may cause disorganization of the network of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments , to form juxtanuclear or perinuclear structures ( Falkner et al. , 1981 ; Welch and Suhan , 1985 ; Collier et al. , 1993 ) ; destruction of the microtubule network ( Lin et al. , 1982 ) ; disintegration of normal actin structures including stress fibers ( Iida et al. , 1986 ) ; and appearance of intranuclear actin rod-shaped bodies ( Welch and Suhan , 1985 ; Iida et al. , 1986 ) .
In addition , it has been shown that heat shock decreases the phosphorylation degree of the nuclear lamins A and C , which are intermediate filament-like proteins ( Krachmarov and Traub , 1993 ) .
By contrast , very little is known about the effects of stress treatments on the synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins .
In the present report we analyze the effect of two typical stress agents , namely heat-shock and cadmium chloride , on the expression of the major cytoskeletal proteins in U-937 cells , a human promonocytic leukemia cell line ( Sundstrom and Nilsson , 1976 ) .
The results indicate that the stress treatments do not only alter vimentin organization , but they also cause an increase in the amount of this intermediate filament protein .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and treatments The U-937 cells used were mycoplasma-free .
The cells were grown in suspension in RPMI-1640 medium , supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.2 % sodium bicarbonate and antibiotics in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere at 37°C .
Cells were seeded in 100 mm plastic dishes at a concentration of 10° cells/ml and maintained in continuous logarithmic growth by passage every 2-3 202 - N. E. Vilaboa and others days .
Actinomycin D ( Sigma Quimica , Madrid , Spain ) was dissolved in absolute ethanol at 5 mM and applied to the culture at of 5 uM .
For cadmium treatments , cadmium chloride ( Merck , Darmstad , FRG ) was freshly dissolved in distilled water at 100 mM and applied to the culture at the desired final concentrations .
For heat-shock , the cultures were transferred to an oven at 42°C .
For recovery after the treatments , the cells were collected by centrifugation , washed once ( in the case of heat-shock ) or three times ( in the case of cadmium treatment ) with pre-warmed ( 37°C ) RPMI medium , and resuspended in pre-warmed cadmium-free medium .
As controls , unheated cadmium-untreated cells were subjected to the same manipulations as treated cells .
Inhibition of cell proliferation and permeability to trypan blue were used as criteria to evaluate the toxicity of the treatments .
Measurement of differentiation markers Nitro blue tetrazolium ( NBT , Sigma Quimica ) reduction was measured by incubating 10° cells for 30 minutes at 37°C in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1 % NBT and 0.15 uM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA , Sigma Quimica ) , after which 0.2 ml of 5 N HCI was added and the cells kept for 1 hour at room temperature .
Upon centrifugation , the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml dimethyl sulfoxide and the absorbance recorded by spectrometry at 560 nm .
The surface expression of CR3 ( CD11b/CD18 ) leukocyte integrin was determined by indirect immunofluorescence combined with flow cytometry using the Bear 1 ( anti-CD11b ) monoclonal antibody , as previously described ( Aller et al. , 1992 ) .
Immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays For immunoblot assays , cells were washed with Ca**- and Mg*+*-free phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and lysed in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl , pH 6.8 , containing 2 % SDS , 5 % ( v/v ) B-mercaptoethanol , and 10 % ( v/v ) glycerol .
After boiling for 2 minutes at 98°C , the protein extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide ( 10 % ) slab minigels ( Laemmli , 1970 ) .
Electrophoretic blotting and immunological detection of proteins were carried out essentially as described by Towbin et al .
( 1979 ) .
The following mAbs were used as first antibodies : a mouse anti-human HSP70 which specifically recognized the stress-inducible form ( clone C92F34-5 , Stress Gene , Biotechnologies Corp , Victoria , Canada ) ; a mouse anti-chicken actin ( Amersham International , Little Chalfont , UK ) ; a mouse anti-chicken -tubulin ( Amersham ) ; and a mouse anti-porcine vimentin ( Amersham ) .
As the second antibody , horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG ( Dakopatts , Copenhagen , Denmark ) was used .
The filters were developed with an enhanced - chemiluminiscence western blotting detection - kit ( Amersham ) , following the procedure described by the manufacturer .
For immunofluorescence assays , cells were washed with PBS and collected on glass slides using a cytospin .
Upon fixation and perme-abilization for 15 minutes with cold absolute methanol , the cells were firstly incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the anti-vimentin mAb in the presence of 1 % bovine serum albumin , then washed three times with PBS , and incubated again for 45 minutes at room temperature with fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG ( Amersham ) in the presence of 1 % bovine serum albumin .
The cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy .
Gel retardation assays Nuclear extracts from 1- to 2x10 '' cells were prepared according to the method of Schreibert et al .
( 1988 ) and stored at -70°C .
The partially complementary oligonucleotides CAAGCCGGATC-3 ' - and 5-GGGATCCGGCTTGACTCATCAC-TAG-3 ' were synthesized in a Gene Assembler Plus ( Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) and used to prepare a double-strand oligonu-cleotide containing an AP-l-recognizing sequence ( wild type AP-1 ) .
The probe was labeled with [ & -°P ] dCTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol , New England Nuclear , Boston , MA , USA ) following the method of Sambrook et al .
( 1989 ) .
The oligonucleotides GCTGCAAGCCGGATC-3 ' and 5-GGGATCCGGCTTGCAGCAT- CACTAG-3 ' were also synthesized and used to prepare an AP-1 mutant oligoprobe .
The binding reaction was carried out for 15 minutes at room temperature in 20 pil of binding buffer ( 25 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCI , 2 mM 1,4-dithiotreitol , 2 % Ficoll , 0.1 % ( v/v ) Nonidet P-40 , 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , 25 mM Hepes , pH 7.4 ) containing 5 ng of the labeled probe , 8 ug of total nuclear proteins , 2 ug of poly ( dI : dC ) , and 2 ug of salmon sperm DNA .
To examine the speci-ficity of binding , the reaction was carried out in the presence of excess wild-type or mutated AP-1 unlabelled probes , and in the presence of 1 pil of a polyclonal anti-jun antibody or pre-immune serum ( obtained from Dr R. Bravo , Bristol-Myers Squibb , Princeton , NJ , USA ) .
The samples were electrophoresed in 4 % polyacrylamide gels , and the gels dried and autoradiographed .
RNA blot assays Total RNA was extracted using an Ultraspect-II RNA isolation kit ( Biotecx Laboratories , Inc. Houston , TX , USA ) , following the procedure described by the manufacturer RNA samples were denatured , electrophoresed in 1.1 % agarose-formaldehyde gels containing 0.1 pg/ml ethidium bromide and blotted onto nylon membranes ( Hybond-N , Amersham ) .
Ethidium bromide staining of 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNAs was routinely checked before blotting as a control of sample loading and after blotting as a control of RNA transfer .
RNA blots were prehybridized , hybridized with excess 3°P-labeled probes , washed under highly stringent conditions and autoradiographed .
The probes used were : the 1.1 kb human vimentin-specific Xhol fragment of p4F1 plasmid ( Ferrari et al. , 1986 ) ; the 2.7 kb fos-specific Xhol-Nco !
fragment of pe-fos '' '' '' '' '' clone ( Van Straaten et al. , 1983 ) ; and the 1.8 plus 0.8 kb human jun-specific EcoRI-Psfl fragments of AH119 clone ( Ryseck et al. , 1988 ) .
The fragments were labeled to approximately 10° cpm/ug of DNA with [ a- '' °P ] dCTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol , New England Nuclear , Boston , MA , USA ) by random hexanucleotide priming ( Feinberg and Vogelstein , 1984 ) .
RESULTS Cell growth , cell differentiation and HSP70 expression We firstly investigated the capacity of pulse treatments with heat ( 2 hours at 42°C ) or cadmium chloride ( 3 hours at concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 uM ) to affect the subsequent proliferation activity of U-937 cells , since proliferation inhibition is a criterium of stress ( Roti Roti et al. , 1992 ) .
The treatments transiently decreased proliferation , which was gradually reinitiated at hour 36 of recovery in the case of heat-shock and 100 uM cadmium , and at hour 60 in the case of 150 uM cadmium ( Fig .
1A ) .
The treatments caused a slight increase in the number of non viable cells , as measured by trypan blue penetration at hour 12 of recovery .
In addition heat-shock and cadmium caused a transient increase in the expression of differentiation markers , namely the surface accumulation of the CD11b/CD18 leukocyte integrin ( Hickstein et al. , 1989 ) and the capacity to reduce NBT ( Collins et al. , 1980 ) ( Fig .
1B ) .
This suggests that stress treatments induce the functional differentiation of myeloid cells , as earlier observed by Richards et al .
( 1988 ) using HL-60 human promyelocytic cells .
As a criterium of stress at the molecular level , the amount of the stress-responsive protein HSP70 was measured at different times of recovery by immunoblot assays .
Both heat-shock ( Fig .
2 ) and 100 uM cadmium chloride ( result not shown ) produced a transient increase in HSP70 which was already detected at the end of the treatment ( hour 0 of recovery ) , reached the maximum at hours 12 to 24 , and decreased thereafter to control PX Viable cells ( x10 5 ) per ml & n xX 0 A o \y : Nix L 0 12 36 60 84 Positive cells ( % ) pe p o 0 T T T X EOV ~ /m [ = J O/ 0.10 0.06 Absorbance 0.02 Hours of treatment Fig .

However , the increase in HSP70 produced by 150 uM cadmium persisted even at 120 hours of recovery ( Fig .

Expression of cytoskeletal proteins To analyze possible effects of the stress treatments on the expression of cytoskeletal proteins , the accumulation levels of actin , -tubulin and the intermediate filament protein vimentin were measured at different times of recovery by immunoblot assays .
It was found that the levels of both actin and tubulin , which were already elevated in non-stressed cells , remained unaltered during recovery from heat-shock ( Fig .
3 ) and cadmium treatments ( results not shown ) .

significant increase during recovery from treatments .
In the case of heat-shock ( Fig .
3 ) and 100 uM cadmium chloride ( result not shown ) , the increase reached the maximum at hour 24 of recovery and decreased thereafter to control levels .
However , in the case of 150 uM cadmium the amount of vimentin remained elevated even at 120 hours of recovery ( Fig .

204 - N. E. Vilaboa and others The changes in vimentin content were corroborated by fluorescence microscopy .
The frequency of cells with detectable amounts of cytoskeleton-associated vimentin was increased at hour 24 of recovery from heat-shock ( Fig .

However , a considerable fraction of cells was still positive for vimentin at hour 72 of recovery from treatment with 150 M cadmium ( Fig .

Changes in vimentin mRNA level .
U-937 cells were heated for 2 hours at 42°C ( HS ) or treated for 3 hours with 150 uM cadmium chloride ( Cd ) , and then allowed to recover for the indicated time periods at 37°C in cadmium-free medium .
Total RNA samples ( 15 ug per lane ) were examined by northern blot using a vimentin specific cDNA probe .
As control , unheated cadmium-untreated cells were used .
Ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNAs in the gel is shown at the bottom , as a control of sample loading .
The fluorescence microscopy assays also revealed changes in vimentin organization .
The well-organized vimentin network present in unstressed cells ( Fig .
4E ) disappeared 3 hours after heat-shock ( Fig .
4F ) or 12 hours after cadmium treatment ( Fig .
4G ) , having the appearance of diffuse fluor-escence .
The network was partially formed again at 24 hours of recovery after heat-shock ( Fig .
4H ) .
Vimentin mRNA accumulation It is known that HSPs may interact with and stabilize other proteins , including cytoskeletal components ( Nishida et al. , 1986 ; Lee et al. , 1993 ) .
Since the kinetics of accumulation of HSP70 ( Fig .
2 ) and vimentin ( Fig .
3 ) during recovery from stress treatments overlapped , we asked whether the increased expression of the intermediate filament during stress could be exclusively regulated at the protein level .
To investigate this question , the vimentin mRNA content was measured by northern blot assays .
Some of the obtained results are shown in Fig .
5 .
It was found that the amount of vimentin mRNA was increased during recovery from heat-shock and cadmium treatments , indicating that the stress agents also stimulated vimentin expression at the RNA level .

Changes in AP-1 binding activity .
Nuclear extracts obtained from untreated cells ( Cont ) and cells allowed to recover for the indicated time periods after cadmium chloride ( Cd , 2 hours at 150 M ) or heat-shock ( HS , 2 hours at 42°C ) treatments were analyzed by gel retardation assay for AP-1 binding .
As controls ( right panel ) , nuclear extracts from cells allowed to recover for 2 hours from cadmium treatment were assayed under the following conditions : in the absence of competitor ( - ) , in the presence of 50-fold molar excess of either wild-type ( WT ) or mutant ( Mut ) AP-1 unlabelled probes , and in the presence of either anti-Jun antibody ( Jun ) or a pre-immune serum ( PS ) .

c-fos expression as well as AP-1 binding activity in some cell types ( Bukh et al. , 1990 ; Jin and Ringertz , 1990 ; Sikora et al. , 1993 ) .
In addition , we previously observed that the increase in vimentin expression caused by differentiation inducers in U937 cells seemed to be mediated by the stimulation of AP-1 binding ( Pérez et al. , 1994 ) .
Hence , we found it of interest to measure the binding of this transcription factor in stressed U937 cells .
It was found that 150 uM cadmium chloride transiently stimulated AP-1 binding at 2 to 5 hours of recovery , to decrease thereafter ( Fig .
6 ) .
The treatment also stimulated the expression at the RNA level of c-jun and c-fos protooncogenes , which encode proteins constituent of AP-1 ( Fig .
7 ) .
Similar results were obtained using 100 uM cadmium chloride ( results not shown ) .
By contrast , heat-shock failed to significantly stimulate both AP-1 binding activity ( Fig .
6 ) as well as c-jun and c-fos expression ( result not shown ) .
Vimentin mRNA stability It has been reported that stress treatments caused stabilization of specific gene transcripts ( Andrews et al. , 1987 ; Buh et al. , 1990 ; Edington and Hightower , 1990 ) .
For this reason , we wanted to determine whether the stress treatments could affect the vimentin mRNA stability .
With this aim , actinomycin D was applied for increased time periods to untreated cells , as well as to cells allowed to recover for 24 hours after heat-shock and cadmium treatments .
Incubations longer than 5 hours were omitted , since actinomycin D caused significant cell damage .

DISCUSSION The results in this work indicate that heat-shock and cadmium chloride do not only cause the disorganization of the vimentin network , but also induce an increase in the amount of this intermediate filament protein in U-937 human promonocytic cells .
The treatments do not alter the accumulation of the other major cytoskeletal components , namely actin and tubulin .
Earlier results by Courgeon et al .
( 1993 ) indicated that stress agents increased the synthesis of actin , tubulin , and a 46 kDa intermediate filament protein in Drosophila cells .
In addition , Wachsberger and Coss ( 1993 ) showed that heat-shock increased the amount of nuclear C lamin in CHO hamster fibroblasts .
In both cases , the overaccumulation of intermediate filaments was only demonstrated at the protein level .
Our present results indicate that the stress-elicited vimentin increase in U-937 cells is regulated at least in part at the RNA level , excluding the possibility that it could be exclusively a consequence of protein stabilization .
Stimulation of vimentin expression has been commontly observed upon mitogen activation of quiescent fibroblasts ( Ferrari et al. , 1986 ) , as well as during the differentiation induction of myeloid leukemia cells ( Rius and Aller , 1992 ) .
In both cases , vimentin stimulation seemed to be the result of increased transcription mediated by the AP-1 responsive elements present in the promoter of this gene ( Rittling et al. , 1989 ; Rius and Aller , 1992 ; Perez et al. , 1994 ) .
This is not the case in stressed U-937 cells , even though the stress treatments induced the expression of differentiation markers .
In fact , heat-shock increased the vimentin mRNA level without significantly affecting AP-1 binding activity ( a result which also contrasts with the reported effect of heat in other cell systems : Sikora et al. , 1993 ) .
Cadmium chloride stimulated AP-1 binding , but there was a clear uncoupling between the time of AP-1 stimulation ( from 2 to 5 hours of recovery ) and the time of maximum increase in vimentin mRNA ( from 24 hours of recovery onwards ) .
The present observations suggest that the increase in vimentin mRNA content in stressed U-937 cells is the result , at least in part , of transcript stabilization .
The stabilized RNA appears to be a mature , normally sized vimentin transcript ( 2.0 kb in size ) capable of translation .
Stress-mediated stabilization has also been observed in the case of other gene transcripts , such as c-myc mRNA in Hyon pre-B lymphocytes ( Bukh , 1990 ) , c-fos mRNA in HeLa cells ( Andrews et al. , 1987 ) , and HSP7O and HSP23 mRNAs in Drosophila cells ( Peterson and Linguist , 1989 ) and chicken cells ( Edington and Hightower , 1990 ) , respectively .
Nevertheless , it is probable that other mechanisms operating at the trans-lational or transcriptional level may also contribute to the increase in vimentin expression .
Actually , the human vimentin gene promoter possesses regulatory elements other than AP-1 which might modulate transcription in either a positive or negative fashion ( Rittling and Baserga , 1987 ; Liliembaum and Paulin , 1993 ) .
The functional significance of vimentin stimulation by heat-shock and cadmium chloride is unknown .
Since the stress treatments induced the expression of differentiation markers , a possibility is that vimentin might form part of , and even regulate , the stress-induced differentiation process , as it was previously demonstrated using other inducers ( Bernal and Chen , 1982 ; Rius and Aller , 1992 ) .
Nevertheless , it must be noted that the mechanism responsible for vimentin increase in cells treated with typical differentiation inducers is not the same as that operating in stressed cells , as commented above .
An alternative explanation is that vimentin may be involved in the acquisition of stress tolerance , a function commontly atributed to HSPs ( Li et al. , 1982 ) .
In fact , our experiments showed that the expression of vimentin partially coincided with that of HSP70 in stressed U-937 cells .
In addition , Lee et al .
( 1992 ) observed that Chinese hamster mutant cell lines with increased levels of vimentin exhibited increased heat-resistance in relation to the wild-type cells , although the mutant cells did not exhibit alterations in HSPs levels .
Hence , it is possible that the overaccumulation of vimentin or other intermediate filaments is one of the factors which contribute to make the cells resistant to environmental stresses .
