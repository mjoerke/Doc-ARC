5 Genetic Characterization of Transactivation of the Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 Promoter : Binding of Tax to Tax-Responsive Element 1 Is Mediated by the Cyclic AMP-Responsive Members of the CREB/ATF Family of Transcription Factors FREDERIC BANT IGNIES , RAPHAEL ROUSSET , CHRISTELLE DESBOIS , anp PIERRE JALINOT* Laboratoire de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire , UMR49 CNRS/ENSL , 69364 Lyon Cedex 07 , France Received 20 November 1995/Returned for modification 12 January 1996/Accepted 23 February 1996 To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 ( TRE-1 ) , we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYCI promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1 .
Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain ( GAD ) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene .
Tax alone was also inactive .
However , expression of the reporter gene was induced by coexpression of Tax and CREB .
This effect was stronger with the GAD-CREB fusion protein .
Analysis of different CREB mutants with this genetic system indicated that the C-terminal 92 amino acid residues , which include the basic domain and the leucine zipper , are necessary and sufficient to mediate transactivation by Tax .
To identify cellular proteins binding to TRE-1 in a Tax-dependent manner , this strain was also used to screen a library of human cDNAs fused to GAD .
Of five positive clones isolated from 0.75 x 10° yeast colonies , four were members of the CREB/activating transcription factor ( ATF ) family : CREB , two isoforms of the cyclic AMP element modulator ( CREM ) , and ATF-1 .
Interestingly , these three proteins can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and thus form a particular subgroup within the CREB/ATF family .
Expression of ATF-2 in S. cerevisiae did not activate TRE-1 in the presence of Tax .
This shows that in a eukaryotic nucleus , Tax specifically interacts with the basic domain-leucine zipper region of ATF-1 , CREB , and CREM .
The fifth clone identified in this screening corresponded to the Ku autoantigen p70 subunit .
When fused to GAD , the C-terminal region of Ku was able to activate transcription via TRE-1 but this activation was not dependent on Tax .
The Tax protein encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) stimulates transcription of the integrated provirus ( 19 , 25 , 48 ) .
This viral protein also modifies the expression of several cellular genes .
In particular , in the promoter of the c-fos gene , Tax activates several enhancer se-quences , including the serum response element ( SRE ) motif ( 3 , 22 ) .
Activation of this latter sequence element results from binding of Tax to p67 '' ( 23 , 55 ) .
Several genes coding for cytokines are activated via xB sites , and Tax is a potent inducer of the nuclear translocation of the NF- « kB/Re ! l factors ( 5 , 35 , 38 , 49 ) .
Repression by Tax of transcription of the gene coding for B-polymerase is mediated via a binding site for basic do-main-helix-loop-helix factors by a poorly understood mechanism ( 36 , 56 ) .
From these observations , it is clear that Tax can interfere with different cellular regulatory pathways , making it a very interesting model of a transcriptional regulator .
In the case of the HTLV-1 provirus , Tax induces the enhancer activity of an imperfect 21-bp repeat .
Following the nomenclature suggested by Marriott et al .
( 40 ) , this sequence will hereafter be called Tax-responsive element 1 ( TRE-1 ) .
This sequence element can be divided into three perfectly conserved domains named A , B , and C ( 26 , 44 ) .
The central B domain ( 5'-TGACG-3 ' ) corresponds to the consensus sequence for the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/ activating transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) family .
In vitro , Tax can increase binding to DNAs of various basic domain * Corresponding author .

2174 leucine zipper ( B-ZIP ) factors by facilitating their dimerization ( 21 , 57 ) .
It has also been shown that Tax binds to HTLV-1 TRE-1 in a sequence-specific manner via cellular factors ( 6 ) .
The cellular B-ZIP factor CREB permits such binding of Tax to TRE-1 ( 54 , 61 ) .
Interestingly , it has been shown by selection amplification experiments that the sequence specificity of the Tax-CREB complex is greater than that of CREB alone , indicating that the sequences flanking the CREB binding site are important for establishment of the ternary complex ( 45 ) .
Careful quantitative studies have determined that Tax accelerates both dimerization of CREB and binding of the CREB dimer to DNA ( 4 ) .
Despite what has been demonstrated in vitro , it has remained unclear whether transactivation in vivo depends on binding of Tax to TRE-1 or merely results from increased binding of CREB/ATF factors to this sequence element .
The precise nature of the members of the CREB/ATF family that allows transactivation of TRE-1 by Tax also remains to be precisely established .
Since Tax induces the activity of TRE-1 in a wide variety of mammalian cell lines , in vivo studies are difficult to interpret because of the active endogenous factors .
To circumvent this problem , an experimental system was developed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
TRE-1 , either wild type or mutated , was cloned upstream of a yeast minimal promoter fused to the B-galactosidase reporter gene .
These constructs were introduced into the yeast genome by homologous recombination .
In this context , TRE-1 did not stimulate expression of the reporter gene , indicating that no active yeast factors bind to this sequence .
Under these conditions , either Tax or CREB expressed in frans was unable , by itself , to activate TRE-1 .
By Vou .
16 , 1996 contrast , their coexpression in the strain bearing wild-type TRE-1 led to marked activation of the B-galactosidase gene .
This experimental approach was used both to delineate the domains within both Tax and CREB that allow assembly of the ternary complex in vivo and to screen a library of human cDNAs for factors that allow association of Tax with TRE-1 .
The results of these experiments show that Tax interacts with TRE-1 through a region overlapping the B-ZIP domain of the factors CREB , the cyclic AMP -responsive element modulator ( CREM ) , and ATF-1 .
ATF-2 , another member of the same family of transcription factors , lacked the capacity to cooperate with Tax .
These experiments also indicate that the Ku autoantigen p70 protein binds to TRE-1 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
Plasmid pRSXORLacZ contains a minimal CYCJ promoter fused to lacZ .
This plasmid integrates a reporter gene into the yeast genome by homologous recombination at the 783 locus .
This construct was made by inserting an Scal restriction fragment of pLGA312-178 ( 31 ) between the EcoRV and Smal restriction sites of pRS303 ( 50 ) .
Plasmids pRSABC3RLacZ and pRSMBM3RLacZ were obtained by inserting three copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the most proximal 21-bp repeat of the HTLV-1 promoter , either wild type ( ABC ) or mutated in domains A and C ( MBM ) , into the XhoI restriction site of pRSXORLacZ ( 44 ) .
The three repeats were in the same orientation as in the HTLV-1 promoter with respect to the CYCZ minimal pro-moter .
Plasmid pLG-ABC3LacZ ( Zum URA3 ) was obtained by inserting the ABC3 motif into the Xhol restriction site of pLGA312-178 ( 31 ) .
Yeast vectors expressing Tax and CREB and bearing either the URA3 or LEU2 selection marker were constructed as follows .
The first series of vectors were derivatives of pMD1 ( CEN6 LEU2 ) .
This vector ( kindly provided by R. Bernards through the courtesy of M. Billaud ) is similar to pPC62 ( 15 ) but contains a different polylinker .
The Tax cDNA , as a HindIII-BsfY1 restriction fragment of pSGT ( 6 ) , was inserted between the HindIII and Bg/lI restriction sites of pMD1 to give pMD1-Tax .
Plasmids pMD1-Tax/M21 , pMD1-Tax/M23 , pMD1-Tax/M26 , pMD1-Tax/M30 , pMD1-Tax/M32 , pMD1-Tax/M35 , pMD1-Tax/M41 , and pMD1-Tax/M47 , expressing the corresponding Tax point mutations ( 52 ) , were constructed by inserting the M/uI-Smal restriction fragments of pGALA4-Tax/M21 , pGALA-Tax/M23 , pGALA-Tax/M26 , pGALA-Tax/M30 , pGALA4-Tax/M32 , pGAL4-Tax/M35 , pGAL4-Tax/M41 , and pGALA4-Tax/M47 ( 13 ) between the M/ul and Smal restriction sites of pMD1-Tax .
Plasmid pMD1-CREB was created by inserting the rat CREB cDNA between the HindIII and Bg/ll restriction sites of pMD1 .
The CREB cDNA was obtained by PCR with pSG-CREB ( kindly provided by P. Sassone-Corsi ) ( 20 ) and specific primers .
The 5 ' primer generated a HindIII restriction site upstream of the AUG codon .
A second series of vectors bearing the URA3 selection marker was constructed .
Plasmids pYU-Tax and pYU-CREB were obtained by inserting the Xhol-BamHI restriction fragments of pMD1-Tax and pMD1-CREB , respectively , between the Xhol and BamHI restriction sites of pRS316 ( CEN6 URA3 ) ( 50 ) .
Plasmid pYT-CREB , bearing the TRP ] selection marker , was obtained by inserting the Xhol-BamHI restriction fragment of pMD1-CREB between the Xhol and BemHI restriction sites of pRS314 ( CEN6 TRP7 ) ( 50 ) .
Vectors producing proteins fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain ( GB ) and the GALA activation domain ( GAD ) are derivatives of pGBT9 ( 2m TRP7 ) and pGAD424 ( Zum LEU2 ) , respectively ( Clontech ) .
A DNA fragment corresponding to the Tax coding sequence was generated by PCR amplification with plasmid pSG-Tax ( 16 ) and appropriate primers .
The 5 ' primer created an in-frame EcoRI restriction site which preceded the second codon of Tax .
The PCR product cut by EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes was inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of pGB-T9 and pGAD424 , giving plasmids pGB-Tax and pGAD-Tax , respectively .
pGB-TaxM9 , pGB-TaxMI18 , and pGB-TaxM47 were generated by the same procedure , with plasmids pGAL4-TaxM9 , pGAL4-TaxM18 , and pGAL4-TaxM47 ( 13 ) .
Plasmid pTax-GB is similar to pGB-Tax , except that GB is fused to the C terminus of Tax .
A fragment including the Tax coding sequence was prepared by PCR from plasmid pMD1-Tax and cut by HindIII and NsiI restriction enzymes .
Another fragment including GB was generated by PCR from pGBT9 and cut by NsiI and EcoRV restriction enzymes .
The in-frame NsiI restriction sites were created by the primers used in the amplification reactions .
These two fragments were inserted between the HindIII and EcoRV restriction sites of pGBTY .
In this construct , the last codon of Tax is fused to the third codon of GB and the two coding sequences are separated by two codons ( Met and His ) .
Plasmid pTax-GAD , expressing Tax fused to GAD at its C terminus , was created by a similar procedure .
The fragment corresponding to GAD was prepared by PCR from pGADA424 , and insertion of both coding sequences was done between the HindIII and EcoRV restriction sites of this latter vector .
pGB-CREB and pGAD-CREB were generated by inserting the CREB coding sequence between the EcoRI and BemHI restriction sites of pGBTY and pGAD424 , respectively .
The fragment including the CREB coding sequence was obtained by PCR from plasmid pSG-CREB by using a 5 ' primer BINDING OF Tax TO THE TRE 2175 creating an EcoRI site , which preceded the initiation codon of CREB .
pGAD-ATF2 was generated by inserting a BamHI restriction fragment of pSG424-ATF2 ( 39 ) ( kindly provided by M. R. Green through the courtesy of C. Kédinger ) into the BamHI restriction site of pGAD424 .
Another series of expression vectors was constructed from plasmid pYUMD1A ( CEN6 URA3 ) .
This latter construct was created as follows .
Plasmid pMD1 , digested by restriction enzymes HindIII and Sell , was filled in and ligated to itself , giving pMD1A .
The Xhol-BamHI restriction fragment of pMD1A , which includes the ADC promoter , a polylinker , and the ADC terminator , was inserted between the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of pRS316 ( 50 ) .
pYU-GADCREB was constructed by inserting the HindII-Bg/II restriction fragment of pGAD-CREB between the HindIII and Bg/II restriction sites of pYUMD1A .
Plasmid pYU-ATF1 was obtained by inserting the ATF-1 cDNA generated by reverse transcription-PCR from mRNA of Jurkat cells between the Smeal and Bgill restriction sites of pYUMD1A .
Plasmid pYU-ATF2 was created by inserting the BamHI restriction fragment of pSG424-ATF2 into the Bg/ll restriction site of pYUMD1A .
The constructs expressing various C-terminal portions of CREB and ATF-2 are also derivatives of pYUMD1A .
Fragments including sequences coding for the C-terminal 92 and 59 amino acid residues of CREB were generated by PCR from pSG-CREB and cut with the SmaI and Bg/l restriction enzymes .
These fragments were inserted between the SmeI and Bg/ll restriction sites of pYUMD1A , giving plasmids pYU-CREBBZ92 and pYU-CREBBZ59 .
Plasmids pYU-ATF2BZ190 and pYU-ATF2BZ92 were generated by the same procedure from pSG424-ATF2 and pYUMD1A .
The various plasmid constructs were systematically verified by sequencing .
Yeast strains .
Yeast cells were grown on rich medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , 2 % dextrose [ YPD ] ) or appropriate selective minimal media at 30°C .
All transformations were carried out with a variation of the lithium acetate method ( 28 ) .
Insertion into the yeast genome of the reporter constructs including the HTLV-1 21-bp repeat upstream of the CYCZ promoter fused to lacZ was performed by homologous recombination .
Plasmids pRSXORLacZ , pRSABC 3RLacZ , and pRSMBM3RLacZ were linearized by digestion with Psfl .
The Ps restriction site is located within the HZIS3 gene .
S. cerevisiae $ 150-2B ( MATa ura3-52 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 his3A gal2 ) ( kindly provided by J. Broach through the courtesy of S. Gasser and E. Gilson ) was transformed by these linearized plasmids , and transformants were selected on histidine-negative synthetic medium ( 0.67 % yeast nitrogen base , 2 % dextrose [ SD ] ) .
Integrations were confirmed by Southern blot and PCR analysis of yeast genomic DNA .
One clone resulting from integration of each construct was selected , giving strains RH4X0 , RHS-ABC3 , and RH14-MBM3 .
These strains were further used for transformation by the Tax and CREB expression vectors .
The two-hybrid analysis was performed with the S. cerevisiqe HF7c reporter strain [ MATa ura3-52 his3-200 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 gal4-542 gal80-538 LYS2 : GALI-HIS3 URA3 : : ( GAL4 17-mers ) ; -CYC ! H-lacZ ) ( Clontech ) .
Strain HF7AURALacZ ( MATa ura3-52 his3-200 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 gal4-542 gal80-538 LYS2 : GALI-HIS3 ) was derived from HF7¢ as follows .
Strain HF7c was transformed with the pCL1 plasmid coding for the full-length GAL4 gene ( 2pm LEU2 ) ( Clontech ) .
Cells ( 10° ) were plated on SD medium without Leu or His and complemented with uracil ( 50 pg/ml ! )
and 5-fluoro-orotic acid ( 0.1 % ) .
5-Fluoro-orotic acid was used for positive selection of ure3 auxotrophic mutants ( 8 ) .
Twenty-six colonies resistant to 5-fluoro-orotic acid were obtained .
These colonies lost both the URA3 selection marker and the GAL4-lacZ reporter gene ( white colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-B-p-galactopyranoside [ X-Gal ] in the presence of the pCL1 plasmid ) .
One yeast colony was selected and cured of the pCL1 vector by growth in YPD , giving strain HF7AURALacZ , which was auxotrophic for Ura , Leu , and His .
This strain contains a functional GALI-HIS3 reporter gene .
HF7AURALacZ was further used for transformation by the pLG-ABC3LacZ reporter plasmid and the Tax and CREB expression vectors .
Screening of the library of human cDNAs fused to GAD .
The RH8-ABC3 reporter strain carrying plasmid pYU-Tax was transformed with a library of human cDNAs fused to GAD ( 18 ) .
The cDNAs were prepared with mRNA from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human peripheral blood lymphocytes and inserted into A-ACT ( 18 ) .
After transformation , yeast cells were plated on SD medium complemented with Trp ( SD minus His , Ura , and Leu ) at a density of 10 x 10° to 20 x 10°/20-cm* dish .
Plates were incubated at 30°C for 4 days .
A total of 7.5 X 10° transformants were obtained and assayed on filters for production of B-galactosidase .
Blue colonies were isolated , and the B-galactosidase assay was repeated .
To test whether expression of B-galactosidase was dependent on the plasmid expressing the GAD-cDNA fusion protein , yeast cells were cured of this plasmid by growth in SD medium complemented with leucine and several colonies were tested for B-galactosidase activity and leucine requirement .
Plasmids of transformants that lost B-galactosidase expression together with the leucine requirement were recovered and transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue by electroporation as previously reported ( 33 ) .
pACT-cDNA plasmids amplified in bacteria were retransformed into the various reporter strains and analyzed by sequencing .
B-Galactosidase assays .
For the B-galactosidase filter assay , yeast colonics were grown on appropriate SD medium and transferred to nitrocellulose filters ( BAS45 ; Schleicher & Schiill ) .
For screening of the cDNA library , colonies were grown on filters for 24 h over SD medium .
The filters were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 1 min to permeabilize the cells , air dried for 2 to 3 min , and then laid on Whatman 3MM paper moistened with Z buffer containing B-mercaptoctha- 2176 BANTIGNIES ET AL .

B-Galactosidase activity was measured with a liquid culture assay .
The bars represent B-galactosidase activity in Miller units .
Measurements were done on two independent transformants for each combination of plasmids , and the mean values are shown .
nol and X-Gal ( 2.5 ml/90-mm-diameter filter ; 21 filter ) ( 11 ) .
Assays were performed at 30°C , and the appearance of blue colonies was periodically checked .
Four independent colonies were analyzed for each test .
For B-galactosidase quantitation by liquid culture assay , 2-ml cultures were grown in the appropriate selective media to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.2 to 1.8 .
Cells were harvested and permeabilized as previously described ( 30 ) .
o-Nitrophenyl-B-p-galactopyranoside was used as the substrate , and assays were performed at 30°C .
B-Galactosidase activities are expressed in Miller units , which were calculated from the following equation : 1,000 x optical density at 420 nm/time of incubation ( minutes ) X optical density at 600 nm x volume of culture ( millili-ters ) ( 43 ) .
Each B-galactosidase activity determination was done in duplicate .
RESULTS Cooperative activation of TRE-1 by CREB and Tax .
The TRE-1 sequence corresponding to the most proximal 21-bp repeat of the HTLV-1 promoter was inserted as three tandem repeats upstream of the CYCI promoter fused to the E. coli lacZ gene ( Fig .

This construct was made with a plasmid which includes the HZ83 selection marker .
A similar construct was made with TRE-1 mutated in domains A and C ( mutation MBM ) ( 44 ) .

The efficiency of the recombination event was monitored by Southern blot and PCR analyses , and one clone for each plasmid was selected , giving strains RH4-X0 ( no TRE-1 ) , RHS8-ABC3 ( three copies of wild-type TRE-1 ) , and RH14-MBM3 ( three copies of TRE-1 mutated in domains A and C ) .
None of the three strains expressed detectable B-galactosidase activity ( Table 1 ) .
Transformation of these strains by plasmids expressing either Tax or CREB did not activate expression of the reporter gene ( Table 1 and Fig .
1B ) .
However , coexpression of Tax and CREB in strain RH8-ABC3 clearly activated production of B-galactosidase .
This effect was not observed in the two other strains .
That CREB did not activate transcription via TRE-1 in the absence of Tax could be due to its inability either to bind to DNA or to activate transcription .
To investigate this point more precisely , CREB was fused to GAD .
Transformation of strains RH8-ABC3 and RH14-MBM3 by a plasmid expressing the GAD-CREB fusion protein led to weak expression of the reporter gene .
Cotrans-formation with a Tax-expressing construct markedly increased the levels of expressed B-galactosidase ( Table 1 and Fig .
1B ) .
This effect was more pronounced with wild-type TRE-1 than with its mutated form .
These results show that CREB binds poorly to TRE-1 by itself and that Tax increases this binding .
A direct protein-protein interaction between Tax and CREB was also investigated by using the two-hybrid system .
Both proteins were fused to either GB or GAD .
It has been reported that fusion of the N-terminal domain of Tax with glutathione S-transferase impairs its interaction with CREB ( 1 ) .
As a con-sequence , GB and GAD were fused to the C terminus of Tax .
We failed to detect an interaction between Tax and CREB in this assay , whatever the combination tested ( Table 2 ) .
This was also the case when GB and GAD were fused to the N terminus of Tax ( data not shown ) .
This negative result could be due to the absence of expression of CREB and Tax fused to GB and GAD .
To eliminate this possibility , the lacZ gene under the control of GAL4 sites , which is integrated in strain HF7c , was removed ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The resulting strain was transformed with a plasmid including the l2cZ gene under the control of three copies of wild-type TRE-1 .
In this strain , Tax-CREB cooperation was tested on both the GALLI upstream activating sequence and TRE-1 ( Table 3 ) .
The results of this experiment unambiguously show that CREB and Tax fused to GB and GAD cause activation via TRE-1 , whereas they do not form a complex on the GAL ] upstream activating sequence ( Table 3 ) .
This indicates that the negative result Vou .

With the two-hybrid system , Tax was found to interact with itself .
A cooperative effect was observed between Tax fused to GB and Tax fused to GAD ( Tables 2 and 3 ) .
This effect was observed when GB and GAD were fused to either the N terminus or the C terminus of Tax .
Tax fused to GB and wild-type Tax also cooperated ( Table 2 ) .
This shows that Tax activates transcription in S. cerevisiae when it indirectly binds to DNA .
Hence , the transcriptional activation observed with the Tax-CREB combination in strain RH8-ABC3 is probably due to Tax .
Fusion of CREB with an activation domain could cause an increased effect .
Collectively , these experiments show that TRE-1 is an active element in the formation of the Tax-CREB complex .
At intracellular concentrations of these two factors , their association is not observed in the absence of TRE-1 .
Domains A and C of the 21-bp element are important for assembly of this ternary complex .
When they are mutated , the activation observed with CREB and Tax is abrogated and that resulting from the GAD-CREB-Tax combination is reduced .

Transformation of this strain carrying a plasmid expressing Tax by a construct producing a factor exhibiting properties similar to that of CREB should indeed lead to activation of the reporter gene , and this event could be monitored by examining coloration of the colonies in a B-galactosidase assay .
On the basis of the results obtained with CREB , to obtain maximal expression of B-galactosidase , constructs containing cDNAs fused to GAD were used .
Strain RHS-ABC3 carrying plasmid pYU-Tax was transformed with a library of human cDNAs fused to GAD ( kindly provided by S. Elledge ) , and colonies were examined for blue coloration .
Plasmids present in positive clones were amplified in E. coli .
Isolated plasmids were reintroduced into strain RH8-ABC3 with or without the Tax-expressing plasmid .
Yeast colonies ( 0.75 % 10° ) were screened by this method , and five positive clones were identified ( Table 4 ) .
Four clones caused expression of the reporter gene in a Tax-dependent manner , whereas the activity of another was not modified by Tax .
The nature of these clones was determined by sequencing .
One ( SCL 4.9 ) corresponded to almost the entire sequence of a human CREB isoform ( 7 ) ( Fig .
2A ) .
Clones SCL 2.38 and SCL 2.7 corresponded to the C-terminal part of two different CREM isoforms including the first B-ZIP domain ( 20 , 24 , 37 , 58 ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
The fourth clone ( SCL 4.1 ) corresponded to the C-terminal domain of ATF-1/TREB-36 ( 32 , 60 ) ( Fig .
2C ) .
Thus , all of the clones binding to TRE-1 in a Tax-dependent manner corresponded to members of the CREB/ATF family .
The coding sequences of these four clones were not in the same reading frame as that of GAD .
The coding sequence of CREB was even inverted with respect to that of GAD .
These results show that in addition to CREB , binding of CREM and ATF-1 to TRE-1 can also be induced by Tax .
The fifth clone identified in this screening corresponded to the C-terminal moiety of the p70 subunit of the Ku autoantigen ( Fig .
2D ) .
In this case , the coding sequence of the p70 subunit of Ku and GAD were in the same reading frame and removal of this latter domain abrogated activation ( data not shown ) .
The association of the p70 subunit of Ku with TRE-1 was independent of Tax .
Mapping of the domains of CREB and Tax involved in the interaction .
The structures of the various CREB/ATF clones identified by screening of the cDNA library show that the domain interacting with Tax lies within the C-terminal domain of these proteins .
To define its position more precisely , vectors expressing either the last 92 or 59 amino acid residues from the C terminus of CREB were constructed ( Fig .
3 ) .
The former led to strong Tax-dependent activation of TRE-1 , and the effect observed was , in fact , more potent than that exerted by the entire CREB protein ( Table 5 and Fig .
4 ) .

Schematic representation of the clones identified by screening a library of human cDNAs in strain RHS8-ABC3 transformed with plasmid pYU-Tax .
The five clones identified in the screening ( see Table 3 ) were sequenced .
The structures of the cDNA inserts contained in these clones are shown under the representations of the CREB ( A ) and CREM ( B ) genes and of the ATF-1 ( C ) and Ku p70 ( D ) cDNAs .
CREB and CREM exons are represented as previously reported ( 58 ) .
In clone SCL 4.9 , the CREB coding sequence begins at amino acid 8 and contains the 14 amino acid residues of exon D ( 7 , 58 ) .
In clones SCL 2.7 and SCL 2.38 , the CREM coding sequence begins at amino acid residues 126 and 216 , respectively ( according to the numbering of Masquilier et al .
[ 41 ] ) .
SCL 2.7 includes exon X , which is absent in SCL 2.38 ( 58 ) .
In clone SCL 4.1 , the ATF-1 coding sequence begins at amino acid 161 ( 32 , 60 ) .
Clone SCL 4.16 includes the Ku p70 coding sequence between amino acid residues 325 and 609 ( 14 , 46 ) .
vector expressing the last 59 amino acid residues from the C terminus of CREB was inactive ( Table 5 ) .
These results show that the CREB domain that binds to TRE-1 in association with Tax lies within the C-terminal 92 amino acid residues , which include the B-ZIP domain .
Smith and Greene have reported a series of point mutations spanning the entire Tax protein ( 52 ) .
These mutant proteins were tested for the ability to induce the HTLV-1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoters .
The intracellular localization of these various mutant proteins was also deter-mined .
To delineate the domain of Tax involved in the interaction with CREB , a series of mutations spanning the region between amino acid residues 134 and 320 in Tax was selected .
These mutant proteins have been described as nuclear and negative for activation of the HTLV-1 promoter ( 52 ) .
These various mutant proteins were expressed in strain RHS8-ABC3 in association with CREB .
Mutants M21 , M23 , M26 , M30 , and M32 were unable to activate expression of the reporter gene ( Fig .
4A ) .
Mutant M35 was weakly active , whereas mutants M41 and M47 gave activity comparable to that of wild-type Tax ( Fig .
4A ) .
These mutants were also tested together with the minimal C-terminal domain of CREB .
The results were similar to those obtained with the entire CREB protein , except that the activation levels were approximately 10-fold higher ( Fig .

Mutants M21 , M23 , M26 , M30 , and M32 could be affected in the ability to interact either with CREB or with the transcriptional machinery .
Addition of a transcriptional activation domain to CREB did not reverse the lack of activity of these five mutants ( Fig .
4C ) .
Thus , these mutations affect the interaction with CREB .
These results show that the Tax domain between amino acid residues 134 and 197 plays an important role in the formation of the TRE-1-CREB-Tax ternary complex .
Specific activity of the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family .
Interestingly , a particular subgroup of the CREB/ATF factors was identified by screening the cDNA library .
ATF-1 , CREM , and CREB are indeed closely related .
These three factors are substrates of protein kinase A , and since they are active in the phosphorylated form , they participate in cyclic AMP signaling .
That other members of the CREB/ATF family were not obtained in the screening could be due either to chance or to their inability to bind to TRE-1 in association with Tax .
To investigate this point , vectors expressing ATF-2 ( 32 ) , alone or in a fusion with GAD , were constructed and used to transform the RHS8-ABC3 reporter strain .
In the absence or presence of Tax , both constructs were unable to activate TRE-1 ( Table 5 and Fig .
5 ) .
To determine whether the absence of response of ATF-2 to Tax could be related to the inhibiting effect of a domain outside the B-ZIP region , two additional vectors expressing either the 192 amino acid residues from the C terminus or the 95-amino-acid domain similar to the C terminus of CREB were also tested ( Fig .
3 ) .
These two vectors were found to be negative , in the presence or the absence of Tax ( Table 5 ) .
In these experiments , it was verified that the entire ATF-1 protein has an activity similar to that of CREB ( Table 5 and Fig .
5 ) .
This shows that CREB , CREM , and ATF-1 are probably the only members of the CREB/ATF family to allow the association of Tax with TRE-1 .
2180 BANTIGNIES ET AL .
DISCUSSION Establishment of the Tax-CREB complex on TRE-1 .
Expression of Tax confers a strong enhancer activity on TRE-1 of the HTLV-1 promoter ( 9 , 26 , 44 ) .
DNA affinity precipitation experiments have shown that Tax binds to TRE-1 in a sequence-specific manner via cellular factors ( 6 , 54 ) .
Studies performed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay led to divergent results ; a complex including Tax was observed by some groups but not others ( 2 , 21 , 57 , 61 ) .
This could be related to the poor stability of such a complex during electrophoretic separation .
That transactivation of TRE-1 results from the indirect binding of Tax has been established uniquely on the basis of in vitro experiments .
Since Tax is active on TRE-1 in a wide variety of mammalian cell lines ( 16 ) , this has not been supported by clear genetic evidence .
This report shows that such genetic studies can be conveniently performed with 8. cerevisiae .
Both Tax and the cellular factor CREB are , by themselves , inactive on TRE-1 in this microorganism , but in combination they lead to its activation .
Experiments with CREB fused to GAD showed that CREB does not bind by itself to wild-type TRE-1 or that mutated in domains A and C. This is in agreement with in vitro data which indicate that a palindromic cyclic AMP response element ( CRE ) is a better binding site for CREB than TRE-1 ( 21 , 59 ) .
Binding of CREB to TRE-1 occurred in the presence of Tax .
This cooperative effect between Tax and CREB was clearly observed with a minimal CREB domain corresponding to the C-terminal 92 amino acid residues .
This part of CREB lacks the transcriptional activation domains located in the N-terminal region .
This indicates that activation of transcription of the reporter gene is exerted by Tax , which is present in the complex .
Although various constructs were tested , a direct protein-protein interaction between Tax and CREB was not observed with the two-hybrid system .
However , binding of Tax to CREB in the absence of TRE-1 has been observed with bacterially produced proteins and recently with a two-hybrid assay performed with mammalian cells ( 1 , 2 , 59 ) .
This suggests that in 8. cerevisiae , the intracellular concentrations of CREB and Tax are too low for this interaction to occur .
Since association of the two factors intervenes on TRE-1 , this DNA sequence plays an active role in the formation of the ternary complex .
This notion is also supported by the results obtained with TRE-1 mutated in both domains A and C. Compared with that of the wild type , this altered sequence caused weaker activation in response to the Tax-CREB combination .
These data clearly show that in vivo transactivation results from formation of the TRE-1-CREB-Tax ternary complex .
This assay with S. cerevisice was used to delineate the domains of CREB and Tax that mediate formation of the complex on TRE-1 in vivo .
Deletion of the N terminus of CREB up to amino acid 282 , just upstream of the first stretch of basic amino acid residues , impaired the cooperative effect with Tax .
The N-terminal limit of the domain permitting binding of Tax on TRE-1 therefore lies between amino acid residues 250 and 282 .
This domain is therefore slightly larger than the B-ZIP region .
Several Tax point mutants were also evaluated by this assay .
Mutant M35 ( `` °Met-Ile- > Ala-Ser ) appears to mark a limit , as mutants with mutations on the N-terminal side are inactive and those with mutations on the C-terminal side have activity similar to that of the wild type .
These data are in good agreement with a recent study which shows that the N terminus of Tax is required for the interaction with CREB ( 1 ) .
It is noteworthy that mutations M41 and M47 , which abrogate the activity of Tax when tested in mammalian cells on the HTLV-1 promoter ( 52 ) and as a fusion protein with GB ( 13 ) , did not have any effect in 8. cerevisiae .
This suggests that Tax acts on Mor .

the transcriptional machinery through different mechanisms in S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells .
Binding of Tax to TRE-1 is permitted by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family .
Screening of a library of human cDNAs for proteins binding to TRE-1 in the presence of Tax led to the isolation of several factors belonging to the CREB/ATF family .
Interestingly , these three factors , CREB , CREM , and ATF-1 , are activated via phosphorylation by protein kinase A ( 17 , 29 ) .
It has been proposed that they form a particular subgroup within the CREB/ATF family ( 34 ) .
Disruption of the CREB gene in mice is compensated for by an increase in the level of expression of CREM ( 34 ) .
The CREB and CREM genes express multiple isoforms ( 7 , 20 , 24 , 37 , 58 ) .
For CREM , depending on the presence or the absence of the Q1 and Q2 domains , these isoforms are either activators or repressors of CREs .
As shown by the structure of the CREM clones obtained and by the results of the experiments with truncated CREB proteins , the binding of Tax depends on a C-terminal domain .
Hence , Tax probably binds to both activator and repressor forms of CREM .
Thus , it is likely that Tax binds to TRE-1 , whatever predominant isoform is expressed in the cell .
That ATF-1 can also cooperate with Tax on TRE-1 is in disagreement with previous in vitro studies ( 2 , 61 ) .
In our assay , it was clear that ATF-1 was as active as CREB .
It is noteworthy that the Tax-binding domain defined in CREB ( the 92 C-terminal amino acid residues ) is highly conserved in ATF-1 ( 71.7 % homology ) , as well as in CREM ( 82.6 % homol-ogy ) .
This domain is less conserved in other members of the CREB/ATF family ( 23.9 % homology between CREB and ATF-2 and 26.1 % homology between CREB and ATF-3 ) .
In agreement with these levels of similarity , ATF-2 was unable to allow binding of Tax to TRE-1 .
On the basis of in vitro experiments , it has been reported that Tax increases the dimerization and DNA binding of ATF-2 ( 21 , 57 ) .
In agreement with a recent in vitro study ( 10 ) , ATF-2 is probably less sensitive to the effect of Tax than ATF-1 , CREB , and CREM .
At intracellular concentrations , this poorer reactivity would result in the absence of binding to TRE-1 .
Thus , although these different CREB/ATF factors should be similar in terms of the overall geometry of the B-ZIP domain , this region of ATF-1 , CREB , and CREM certainly has particular features which result in strong binding to Tax .
It is intriguing that the B-ZIP domains of these three factors that are activated by the protein kinase A pathway possess a common specificity .
It will be interesting to identify the structural aspect of this region which confers reactivity on the Tax protein .
The p70 subunit of the Ku autoantigen interacts with TRE-1 .
Unexpectedly , a clone coding for the C-terminal moiety of the p70 subunit of the autoantigen Ku was also isolated by screening for cellular factors binding to TRE-1 .
Ku has been identified as a nuclear protein against which patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus develop autoantibodies ( 14 , 46 ) .
Ku has been involved in DNA repair , homologous recombination , and transcriptional regulation ( 27 , 42 , 47 , 51 ) .
Ku corresponds to a heterodimer of two subunits , p70 and p86 .
In association with a third catalytic subunit , it forms a complex exhibiting a DNA-dependent kinase activity ( DNA-PK ) ( 12 , 53 ) .
Our data show that p70 of Ku binds to TRE-1 in a cellular context .
Future studies should clarify how Ku intervenes in the transactivation of TRE-1 by Tax .
It will be interesting to study whether binding of the p70 subunit of Ku to DNA causes activation of DNA-PK at TRE-1 .
This event might cause modification via phosphorylation of several components of the transcriptional initiation complex .
In conclusion , the data obtained with the experimental system that we have developed with S. cerevisige confirm and Vou .
16 , 1996 extend our understanding of the mechanism of transactivation of HTLV-1 TRE-1 by Tax .
The cellular factors which respond to an increase in the level of cyclic AMP mediate the specific binding of Tax to TRE-1 .
This property depends on a C-terminal domain which includes the B-ZIP region .
This model illustrates how a viral transactivator subverts specific cellular transcription factors to the benefit of a pathogenic virus .
