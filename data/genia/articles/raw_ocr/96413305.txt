10 Induction of be/-2 Expression by Phosphorylated CREB Proteins during B-Cell Activation and Rescue from Apoptosis BYRON E. WILSON , EVONNE MOCHON , anp LINDA M. BOXER* Center for Molecular Biology in Medicine , Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center , and Department of Medicine , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 Received 29 March 1996/Returned for modification 27 May 1996/Accepted 11 July 1996 Engagement of surface immunoglobulin on mature B cells leads to rescue from apoptosis and to proliferation .
Levels of be/-2 mRNA and protein increase with cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin .
We have located the major positive regulatory region for control of be/-2 expression in B cells in the 5 ' -flanking region .
The positive region can be divided into an upstream and a downstream regulatory region .
The downstream regulatory region contains a cyclic AMP-responsive element ( CRE ) .
We show by antibody supershift experiments and UV cross-linking followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that both CREB and ATF family members bind to this region in vitro .
Mutations of the CRE site that result in loss of CREB binding also lead to loss of functional activity of the be/-2 promoter in transient-transfection assays .
The presence of an active CRE site in the be/-2 promoter implies that the regulation of be/-2 expression is linked to a signal transduction pathway in B cells .
Treatment of the mature B-cell line BAL-17 with either anti-immunoglobulin M or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate leads to an increase in be/-2 expression that is mediated by the CRE site .
Treatment of the more immature B-cell line , Ramos , with phorbol esters rescues the cells from calcium-dependent apoptosis .
be/-2 expression is increased following phorbol ester treatment , and the increased expression is dependent on the CRE site .
These stimuli result in phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 .
The phosphorylation of CREB that results in activation is mediated by protein kinase C rather than by protein kinase A .
Although the CRE site is necessary , optimal induction of be/-2 expression requires participation of the upstream regulatory element , suggesting that phosphorylation of CREB alters its interaction with the upstream regulatory element .
The CRE site in the be/-2 promoter appears to play a major role in the induction of bel-2 expression during the activation of mature B cells and during the rescue of immature B cells from apoptosis .
It is possible that the CRE site is responsible for induction of be/-2 expression in other cell types , particularly those in which protein kinase C is involved .
The induction of a humoral immune response is complex .
It involves initial activation of resting B cells , subsequent proliferation of the activated precursors , and differentiation of the activated cells into mature immunoglobulin-secreting cells .
The process of differentiation has been studied by using Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 to bind to the antigen receptor because it can induce B-cell DNA synthesis in a T-cell-inde-pendent manner ( 16 , 48 ) .
One of the many changes in gene expression during B-cell activation is an increase in the expression of bei-2 at the mRNA level ( 22 , 45 ) .
Engagement of the B-cell antigen receptor leads to differing outcomes depending on the stage of development of the B cell .
Apoptosis plays a key role in this process .
In the bone marrow , self-reactive immature surface IgM * IgD~ B cells are eliminated by apoptosis ; this process leads to induction of tolerance .
At the pro-B-cell stage , as immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gene rearrangement is occurring , the vast majority of cells die by apoptosis .
Binding of antigen to the antigen receptor in immature B cells leads to death by apoptosis ( 13 , 26 ) .
In cell line models , this is associated with a decrease in the level of bel-2 mRNA ( 14 ) .
Anti-CD40 antibodies protect against apoptosis and result in an increase in the expression of be/-2 ( 52 ) .
Apoptosis plays a role in the development of mature lym- * Corresponding author .

In the germinal centers , widespread apoptosis is observed .
Engagement of surface Ig leads to rescue from apoptosis .
Increased expression of be/-2 is observed when germinal-center cells are prevented from undergoing apoptosis ( 33 , 35 ) .
Binding of antigen to the B-cell receptor in resting B cells leads to proliferation .
Binding of antigen to the B-cell receptor on either germinal-center cells or resting B cells leads to a similar pattern of second-messenger induction , including activation of Sre and Sre-related protein kinases ( 4 , 60 ) , phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of a number of substrates ( 3 , 6 , 20 , 31 ) , engagement of G proteins ( 19 , 25 , 39 ) , increased inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate levels , increased intracellular calcium levels , and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( 5 , 9 ) .
Activation of PKC leads to activation of NF-kB and AP-1 , as well as other transcription factors ( 10 , 34 , 54 ) .
Burkitt 's lymphoma cells undergo apoptosis after ligation of surface IgM or treatment with a calcium ionophore ( 2 , 7 , 18 , 23 , 28 , 53 ) .
Group I Burkitt 's lymphoma cells display a surface phenotype characteristic of germinal-center cells , and they have been used as a model for germinal-center B cells ( 28 ) .
Activation of PKC by phorbol esters reduces apoptosis induced by calcium ionophores or surface IgM ligation ( 53 ) .
Apoptosis can also be triggered by inhibitors of PKC .
High-level expression of Bel-2 protects Burkitt 's lymphoma cells from apoptosis induced by ionomycin or surface IgM cross-linking ( 28 , 42 ) .
Treatment of Burkitt 's lymphoma cells with phorbol esters causes an up-regulation of be/-2 mRNA and protein ( 18 ) .

16 , 1996 lines from apoptosis induced by ionomycin by up-regulation of bel-2 by a mechanism that is dependent on PKC ( 18 ) .
The major transcriptional promoter for bei-2 , P1 , is located 1,386 to 1,423 bp upstream of the translation start site ( 50 ) .
This is a TATA-less , GC-rich promoter that displays multiple transcription state sites .
A minor promoter , P2 , which is used in some cell types , is located 1.3 kb downstream from the first one ( 50 ) .
Little information is available concerning the transcriptional control of the be/-2 gene .
A negative regulatory element upstream of the P2 promoter has been described previously ( 61 ) .
The proteins that bind to this element have not been identified , although p53 was shown to mediate downregu-lation of be/-2 either directly or indirectly through a 195-bp fragment of this region ( 37 ) .
We have previously described three sites which are negative regulators of be/-2 expression in pre-B cells ( 8 ) .
Normal pre-B cells express very little be/-2 , and extensive cell death by apoptosis occurs at this developmental stage .
Bel-2 protein levels are increased in mature B cells .
We have found that the three # 1 sites are not functional in mature B cells ( 8 ) .
In the present study , we characterize the regulatory regions , including a cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) -responsive element ( CRE ) , that are responsible for the positive regulation of be/-2 expression in both pre-B cells and mature B cells .
Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels can result in either stimulation or repression of specific gene expression ; most of these genes contain one or more CREs .
The consensus CRE sequence is GTGACGTCA .
cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA and releases the active catalytic subunit .
This subunit phosphorylates the transactivation domain of CRE-binding protein ( CREB ) , which then induces the expression of genes containing CREs .
Mutation of the phosphoacceptor site ( Ser-133 ) results in a dominant negative form of CREB ( 1 , 51 ) .
A number of CREBs , including CREB , CRE modulator , and several activating transcription factors ( ATFs ) , have been de-scribed .
The CREBs are basic leucine zipper transcription factors and are active as either homo- or heterodimers .
Some of the ATFs heterodimerize with members of the Jun/Fos family of proteins ( for reviews , see references 30 , 32 , and 36 ) .
We have elucidated the mechanism of increased bel-2 expression during B-cell activation in mature B cells and during rescue from calcium-dependent apoptosis of immature B cells .
We have found that a CRE mediates the increase in be/-2 expression following surface Ig cross-linking in mature B cells or treatment with phorbol esters in both mature and immature B cells .
Furthermore , we present evidence that PKC is responsible for the activation of CREB by phosphorylation .
Optimal bel-2 activation occurs when the phosphorylated CREB interacts with an upstream regulatory region , suggesting that phosphorylation changes the interaction of CREB with neighboring promoter elements .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid constructs .
A DNA fragment from BamHI ( -3934 ) to Secl ( -1287 ) of the human be/-2 gene ( a generous gift from Michael Cleary , Stanford Uni-versity ) was inserted into a luciferase reporter vector with Psfl linkers .
Numbering of the bel-2 sequence is relative to the translation start site .
Progressive 5 ' truncations of the be/-2 sequence by restriction digestion gave rise to constructs spanning the sequence from Sacl ( -1287 ) to Xhol ( -2857 ) , Avril ( -2337 ) , Nof ( -1794 ) , SacII ( -1743 ) , SaclI ( -1693 ) , SaclII ( -1640 ) , BsrFI ( -1526 ) , and Apal ( -1337 ) .
Additional 5 ' truncations were generated by PCR subfragment cloning to form constructs spanning the sequence from Secl ( -1287 ) to introduced BamHI sites at -1473 and -1413 ( see Fig .
1 ) .
To study the activity observed between SeclI ( -1640 ) and BsrFI ( -1526 ) in more detail , subfragments of this area generated by PCR cloning or oligonucleotide synthesis were inserted into a polylinker at the BsrFI site in the -1526-bel-2 plasmid constructed as described above .
Progressive 5'-subfragment truncations spanning from -1526 to -1640 , to -1611 , to -1578 , to -1564 , and to INDUCTION OF be/-2 BY CREB PROTEINS 5547 -1552 were inserted in this polylinker .
Interposition of the polylinker between contiguous be/-2 sequences at site -1526 did not alter promoter activity when compared with analogous controls without polylinker ( data not shown ) .
A plasmid containing the wild-type upstream regulatory element ( WiURE ) was constructed in the same manner by inserting the PCR-cloned sequence -1640 to -1544 in the polylinker 5 '' of the -1526-bcf-2 plasmid .
A plasmid containing the wild-type downstream regulatory element ( WtDRE ) , including the endogenous bel-2 CRE site , was constructed by inserting the synthesized oligonucleotide sequence -1552 through -1535 in the polylinker 5 '' of the -1526-bcf-2 plasmid .
Plasmids with mutations in and near the CRE site were constructed similarly with the sequences shown in Table 1 .
The following base pairs were mutated ( with plasmid name in parentheses ) : -1552 and -1548 ( mC1,4 ) ; -1551 through -1549 ( mC2-3 ) ; -1547 and -1545 ( mC6,8 ) ; -1541 and -1540 ( mC12,13 ) ; -1540 and -1539 ( mCâ¬13,14 ) ; and -1540 through -1536 ( mC13-17 ) .
A construct ( MutCRE ) with the CRE site changed from GTGACGTTA to GTGAA TTTA was prepared from the -1640 construct with the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) .
A construct containing two CRE sites was prepared by inserting CRE oligonucleotides with Sa/l and Xhol ends into the Sa/l site of the pGL2 promoter , a luciferase reporter gene linked to the simian virus 40 promoter ( Promega ) .
A similar construct containing two copies of the Ig heavy-chain enhancer l site has been described previously ( 8 ) .
All plasmid sequences were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide method ( Sequenase ; U.S. Biochemical ) .
The CRE-dependent plasmid ( Bg/ll CAT ) and Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) CREB and RSV CREB M1 were obtained from Marc Montminy , Salk Institute .
The Bg/II CAT construct contains the somatostatin gene promoter from -71 to +53 linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene ( 40 ) .
RSV CREB expresses full-length CREB from the RSV promoter , and RSV CREB M1 expresses full-length CREB with serine 133 changed to alanine ( 21 ) .

A total of 10 to 20 jg of plasmid DNA was added , and electroporation was performed with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 960 wF and 350 mV for DHL-9 , 320 mV for Ramos , 300 mV for Nall-1 , or 400 mV for BAL-17 cells .
Transfected cells were cultured in 25 ml of supplemented RPMI medium for 48 h. Reporter gene activity was determined by the luciferase assay system ( Promega ) , and luminescence was quantitated with an LKB 1251 luminometer .
Variation in transfection efficiency was controlled for by cotransfection with 5 ug of an RSV long terminal repeat-B-galactosidase or a simian virus 40 promoter-B-galactosidase plasmid .
Each assay was performed at least three times in duplicate with at least two different plasmid preparations .
The normalized mean values with standard deviations were plotted or reported in tabular form .

UV cross-linking and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
EMSA was performed as described above .
UV cross-linking was performed as described previously ( 11 ) with a short-wavelength UV light box at 4Â°C for 60 min .
An autoradiograph of the wet gel was used to locate the EMSA complexes .
Regions of the gel containing the complexes were cut out , and the individual complexes were eluted at room temperature overnight in 50 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.9 ) -0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -0.1 mM EDTA-5 mM dithiothreitol-150 mM NaCl-0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml .

RESULTS Identification of two positive regulatory regions in the bel-2 promoter .
The be/-2 major transcriptional promoter , P1 , is located between bp -1390 and -1440 upstream from the translation start site ( 50 ) .
bel-2 sequence from -3934 to -1287 that contains the P1 promoter was inserted upstream of a promoterless luciferase reporter gene construct ( Fig .
1A ) , and reporter gene activity in DHL-9 cells ( a human mature B-cell line ) was assessed .
We were unable to demonstrate any transcript initiation at the P2 promoter ( 8 ) .
Constructs that contained both the P1 and P2 promoters yielded similar results , although the activity of the constructs with the P2 promoter was much lower because of the negative regulatory element just upstream of P2 ( data not shown ) ( 61 ) .
Progressive 5 ' truncations of the be ! -2 sequence revealed a positive regulatory region between the SaeclII site at -1640 and a BsrFI site at -1526 ( Fig .
1A ) .
In DHL-9 cells , this area resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in reporter gene activity over the basal promoter ( -1526 ) construct .
This appeared to be the only positive regulatory region .
Similar results were obtained with the pre-B-cell line , Nall-1 ( data not shown ) .
Comparison of the murine and human be/-2 sequences revealed a high degree of homol-ogy in this area .
To study the activity observed between SecII ( -1640 ) and BsrFI ( -1526 ) in more detail , subfragments of this area were inserted upstream of the BsrFI ( -1526 ) site .
Progressive 5 ' truncations within this area revealed two positive regulatory regions in DHL-9 cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
The DRE , located between -1552 and -1526 , was responsible for a 1.5-fold increase in basal promoter activity over that obtained with a P1 promoter control construct .
This activity was preserved when a 3 ' deletion narrowed this element to -1552 through -1534 .
The remainder of the positive regulatory activity was located between -1611 and -1552 ; this area is the URE .

studies suggest that the 5 ' end of the URE was located between -1611 and -1591 .
Constructs with deletions or additions of sequence between the two regions that disrupted the helical spacing resulted in promoter activities similar to that of the DRE alone ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that disruption of the helical spacing between the URE and DRE leads to loss of the positive interaction between these elements .
The URE has not been further characterized .
Sequence specificity of protein binding to the DRE .
EMSA of nuclear extracts obtained from the B-cell lines DHL-9 , Ramos , Nalm-6 , and Reh with an oligonucleotide corresponding to bel-2 sequence -1552 to -1525 or -1552 to -1535 , both of which contain WtDRE , revealed four specific bands Vou .

EMSA with DRE oligonucleotides and DHL-9 nuclear extracts .

The sequences of the different DRE oligonucleotides are listed in Table 1 .

( B ) Competition with mutated CRE oligonucleotides .
The indicated oligonucleotide is present at a 50-fold molar excess .
The specific complexes are indicated by arrows .
( the results for DHL-9 are shown in Fig .

Sequence mutation analysis within the DRE identified two distinguishable protein-binding sites by EMSA ( Fig .
2A ) and by EMSA with competition with the mutated oligonucleotides ( Fig .
2B ) .
The results are summarized in Table 1 .
The 5 ' site spanned the sequence from -1552 to -1541 and produced a single band on EMSA which corresponded to the fastest migrating of the four specific bands ( Fig .
2 , lane 5 ) .
The 3 ' site spanned from -1547 to -1534 and produced one slowly migrating band and two more rapidly migrating bands ( bands 1 , 2 , and 3 from most slowly to most rapidly migrating in Fig .
2 ) .
The 3 ' site contains a complete CRE consensus sequence , while the 5 ' site contains only part of the CRE .
Consequently , they are referred to as the bel-2 CRE ( bCRE ) site and the CRE-overlapping site ( CREO site ) , respectively .
EMSA with the CRE consensus oligonucleotide with be/-2-flanking sequences yielded the same four complexes that were seen with the WtDRE oligonucleotide , and the two oligonucleotides competed against one another ( data not shown ) .
The CREO site does not appear to be homologous to any known transcription factor consensus-binding site .
Transient-transfection assays were performed with DHL-9 cells and reporter gene constructs that contained mutations in the CREO and bCRE sites in the absence of the URE site .
As seen in Table 1 , it appeared the bCRE site was responsible for most if not all of the positive regulatory activity in this area .
The CREO site appeared to have only weak stimulatory activity .
The 5'- and 3'-binding sites were also distinguishable by in vitro methylation interference ( footprinting ) analysis , which confirmed the site lengths of -1552 to -1541 and -1547 to -1534 , respectively ( Fig .
3 ) .
Protein binding to the bCRE was strongly inhibited ( > 60 % inhibition ) by guanine methylation at sites -1545 , -1543 , -1541 , and -1540 .
Weaker inhibition ( 35 to 60 % inhibition ) was seen at sites -1547 and -1535 .
Protein binding to the CREO site was strongly inhibited by methylation at sites -1549 , -1548 , -1547 , and -1545 .
Weaker inhibition was seen at sites -1552 and -1543 .
This analysis confirmed an overlap between the bCRE and the CREO sites .

UV cross-linking of the most slowly migrating bCRE band , band 1 , obtained by EMSA with mC1,4 yielded two protein-DNA complexes migrating at 77 and 88 kDa ( Fig .
4A , lane 3 ) .
Correcting for oligonucleotide size , proteins of approximately 63 and 67 kDa were predicted .
In addition , this EMSA band yielded two faintly labeled protein-DNA complexes migrating at 130 and 170 kDa , which may represent dimeric forms of the faster-migrating proteins .
UV cross-linking of bCRE band 2 revealed a protein-DNA complex of 53 kDa ( corrected protein size , 43 kDa ) ( Fig .
4A , lane 2 ) .
A faintly labeled protein-DNA complex of approximately 100 kDa , which may represent a homodimeric complex of the 43-kDa protein , was seen .
The fastest migrating bCRE band , band 3 , yielded two protein-DNA complexes of 45 and 53 kDa ( corrected protein sizes , 34 and 43 kDa , respectively ) ( lane 1 ) .
Again , a faintly labeled protein-DNA complex of approximately 94 kDa was seen , which may represent a het-erodimeric complex .
EMSA supershift analyses of the bCRE complexes were performed with antibodies directed against several known CREBs ( ATF-1 , ATF-2 , ATF-3 , CREB , CREB-2 , and CREM-1 ) and several non-CREBs ( PEA3 , c-jun/AP-1 , c-fos , egr-1 , and ets1/ets2 ) .
Performing this analysis with the mC1,4 oligonucleotide probe demonstrated a supershift of bCRE band 1 with antibodies against ATF-2 and ATF-1/ATF-2 .
bCRE band 2 was supershifted with antibodies against CREB and ATF-1/CREB , and bCRE band 3 was supershifted only with antibody against ATF-1/CREB ( Fig .
4B ) .
None of the other antibodies tested shifted either the bCRE bands or the CREO band .
Western blot ( immunoblot ) analysis of DHL-9 nuclear extract revealed abundant expression of ATF-2 ( reactive antigens found at 62 , 67 , and 170 kDa ) and CREB ( reactive antigen found at 43 kDa [ data not shown ) .
By Western blot analysis , the ATF-1/ATF-2 antibody displayed weak cross-reactivity with the ATF-2 antigens , suggesting that the supershift A B a l LL CC o < q o ou E it .

Interaction of a purified truncated CREB with the CREBs in DHL-9 nuclear extract by EMSA with the mC1,4 oligonucleotide .
Decreasing amounts of a purified truncated CREB were added to a constant protein concentration from DHL-9 nuclear extract ( 2 pug/pl ) .
The arrows indicate the complexes formed with DHL-9 nuclear extract , the complex formed by the truncated CREB protein , and the complex of intermediate mobility formed with the truncated CREB and with CREB in DHL-9 nuclear extract .
Quantitation of the bands was performed for the EMSA with 1.0 and 5.0 ng of truncated CREB per ml .
There was no change in the relative intensity of the bCRE1 and CREO bands .
With 1.0 and 5.0 ng of truncated CREB per pl , CRE band 2 decreased by 18 and 70 % , respectively , and bCRE band 3 decreased by 28 and 83 % , respectively .
activity seen with this antibody was a result of cross-reactivity with ATF-2 and not involvement of ATF-1 in the protein-DNA complex bCRE band 1 .
The ATF-1/CREB antibody is known to have polyspecific reactivity .
By Western blot analysis , it was strongly reactive with CREB-1 and weakly reactive with several other antigens ( of 35 , 38 , 49 , 65 , 74 , and 138 kDa ) .
Members of the CREB/ATF family form homo- and heterodimers .
To further confirm the involvement of CREB/ATF family members in the bCRE complexes , EMSA of the mC1,4 oligonucleotide was performed in the presence of decreasing amounts of a truncated CREB that contains the DNA-binding and dimerization domains ( Fig .
5 ) .
High concentrations of this protein ( > 10 ng/pul ) effectively blocked the binding of nuclear extract proteins to both the bCRE and CREO sites , confirming that these sites overlap and that the bCRE site can function as a CRE site ( data not shown ) .
Lower concentrations ( 0.008 to 5 ng/pul ) of the truncated CREB produced one intermediate migrating band with concurrent relative diminution in the intensity of bCRE band 2 and 3 but not in the intensity of bCRE band 1 or of the CREO band ( Fig .
5 ) .
These results confirmed that the proteins involved in bCRE bands 2 and 3 are capable of dimerization with CREB .
As ATF-2 is a distant relative of CREB and has not been shown to dimerize with CREB , it is not surprising that no interaction between the truncated CREB and the bCRE band 1 was seen ( 36 ) .
Thus , the be/-2 CRE site appears to be able to form three complexes with B-cell nuclear extracts , each represented by a specific EMSA band .
The most slowly migrating complex ( bCRE band 1 ) appears to consist of dimerized 63- and 67-kDa forms of ATF-2 .
The middle complex ( bCRE band 2 ) is apparently a homodimer of CREB , and the fastest-migrating complex ( bCRE band 3 ) is a heterodimer of CREB and possibly ATF-1 .
To confirm the importance of the CRE site in the full-length bel-2 promoter , site-directed mutagenesis was used to create a 2-bp change in the CRE site in the WtURE/DRE construct ( MutCRE ) .
As shown in Fig .
6 , the promoter activity decreased by 83 % relative to the WtURE/DRE construct .

regulatory element , we wished to determine whether a CREB was involved in the increase in be/-2 expression during B-cell activation .
DHL-9 cells could not be used for these studies because they do not express surface IgM .
The murine B-cell line , BAL-17 , was chosen because it has been shown to recapitulate many of the characteristics of primary B cells after surface Ig receptor cross-linking .
Although BAL-17 cells express relatively high levels of be/-2 , cross-linking of the surface Ig receptor or treatment with PMA leads to a further 2.5- to 3.5-fold increase in be/-2 mRNA levels ( Fig .
7B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
To determine the effect on be/-2 promoter activity , cross-linking of surface Ig receptor was performed with goat anti-IgM antibodies 24 h after transfection of the be/-2-luciferase constructs .
The be/-2 promoter constructs used are shown in Fig .
7A .
The activity of the bel-2 promoter increased by threefold ( Fig .
7C ) .
We used either dibutyryl-cAMP or forskolin to increase cAMP levels .
This PKA pathway is involved in the phosphorylation of CREBs in many different cell types .
As shown in Fig .
7C , forskolin did not produce an increase in be/-2 promoter activity .
Similar negative results were obtained with dibutyryl-cAMP ( data not shown ) .
Because CREB is phosphorylated by other kinases , including PKC , we treated the BAL-17 cells with PMA .
PMA produced a threefold activation ( Fig .
7C ) .
The increase in activity due to PMA was very similar to that observed with surface Ig receptor cross-linking .
Simultaneous stimulation with PMA and Ig cross-linking resulted in little additional stimulation of promoter activity , suggesting that the stimulation evoked by surface Ig cross-linking was almost entirely due to a PKC mechanism .
Similar results were obtained with a control plasmid ( Bg/II CAT ) that contains the somatostatin gene promoter CRE site .
Treatment of BAL-17 cells with PMA led to a threefold increase in CAT activity , while treatment with forskolin had no effect ( data not shown ) .
The reason for the failure of increased cAMP levels to activate a CRE site in these cells is unclear .
It is possible that an inhibitor of PKA is present in the cell lines we used for these studies .
The increase in activity of the be/-2 promoter with both anti-IgM and PMA was dependent on the presence of the CRE site .
As shown in Fig .
7C , there was no change in the activity of either the WtURE or MutCRE constructs .
A promoter construct with the URE deleted showed only a 60 % increase in activity with PMA .
These results suggest that the bCRE site is required for the increased promoter activity and that interaction of the URE and bCRE results in maximal stimulation of promoter activity .
Thus , be/-2 expression is activated by surface Ig receptor cross-linking or by PMA through the CRE site in the 5'-flanking sequence .

Nuclear extracts were prepared after incubation with the indicated compound for 30 min .
An antibody that recognizes all CREBs ( lane C ) or an antibody specific for the phosphorylated CREB ( lanes P ) was added prior to EMSA as indicated .
To confirm that CREB was phosphorylated by both surface Ig receptor cross-linking and PMA , we performed EMSA with an antibody specific for phosphorylated CREB .
Figure 7D demonstrates that very little phosphorylated CREB is present in unstimulated BAL-17 cells .
Treatment with either anti-IgM or PMA led to the appearance of a complex that was supershifted with the antibody specific for phosphorylated CREB ( Fig .
7D , lanes 4 and 6 ) .
Thus , phosphorylation of CREB after surface Ig cross-linking is mediated by PKC and the phosphorylated CREBs activate the be/-2 promoter .
BAL-17 cells express relatively high levels of be/-2 , so we wished to examine the up-regulation of be/-2 in a mature B-cell line that expressed low levels of be/-2 .
We treated the DHL-9 cell line with PMA for 18 h after transfection of the bel-2-luciferase constructs .
The activity of the be/-2 promoter increased by ninefold , and the increase was dependent on the CRE site ( Fig .
8A ) .
As was the case for BAL-17 cells , maximal stimulation required the presence of the URE .
Analysis of the CREBs in DHL-9 nuclear extracts revealed that phosphorylation on serine 133 occurred after treatment of the cells with PMA and to a lesser extent after treatment with forskolin ( Fig .
8B , lanes 4 and 6 ) .
As was the case with BAL-17 cells , treatment of DHL-9 cells with forskolin did not result in an increase in bel-2 promoter activity ( data not shown ) .
To further demonstrate the importance of CREB in the regulation of the be/-2 promoter , cotransfection experiments were performed with a wild-type CREB expression vector or a dominant negative CREB M1 expression vector .
The dominant negative CREB contains an alanine at position 133 and can not be phosphorylated ( 21 , 51 ) .
As shown in Fig .
8C , cotransfection with either the wild-type CREB or CREB M1 resulted in a twofold increase in the constitutive activity of the bel-2 promoter .
With PMA stimulation , there was a slight increase in promoter activity with the wild-type CREB construct and a dramatic decrease with the CREB M1 construct .
These changes were mediated through the be ! -2 CRE site , because there was no change in the activity of the promoter construct with mutated CRE site ( Fig .
8C ) .
Furthermore , a construct with two CRE sites linked to the simian virus 40 promoter showed changes similar to the be/-2 promoter when Vou .

A 1-pg portion of the RSV CREB constructs ( wild type [ WT ] , dominant negative mutant [ M1 ] ) or the empty expression vector ( Cont . )
and 10 ug of either the CRE or # 1 construct were used in each transfection experiment .
The basal activity of each promoter in the presence of the empty expression vector was assigned a value of 100. wild-type and mutant CREB expression vectors were cotransfected ( Fig .
8D ) .
The CRE site was required since a construct with two # 1-binding sites showed no change in activity with cotransfection of either wild-type or M1 CREB ( Fig .
8D ) .
These results provide additional support for the role of phosphorylated CREBs in the regulation of the be/-2 promoter during B-cell activation .
We also wished to determine whether the CRE site in the bel-2 promoter mediated the increase in be/-2 mRNA that is seen in more immature B-cell lines that are rescued from apoptosis induced by anti-IgM or calcium ionophores .
Treatment with phorbol esters prevents the apoptosis .
We used the Epstein-Barr virus-negative Ramos cell line to avoid the confounding effects of Epstein-Barr virus gene products on be/-2 expression .
We confirmed by several different techniques including cell survival and DNA fragmentation analysis that ionomycin caused apoptosis in Ramos cells ( Fig .
9A and B ) .
Treatment with PMA protected the cells from apoptosis ( Fig .
9A and B ) .
Ramos cells were transfected with the be/-2 pro moter-luciferase constructs and treated with ionomycin , PMA , or ionomycin plus PMA for 6 h before being harvested .
As shown in Fig .
9C , treatment with PMA or PMA plus ionomycin resulted in a 12-fold increase in be/-2 promoter activity .
There was no increase in promoter activity if the CRE site was mu-tated .
Finally , we demonstrated that treatment of Ramos cells with PMA resulted in phosphorylation of CREBs at serine 133 and that treatment with forskolin had a smaller effect ( Fig .
9D , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
DISCUSSION We have identified the major positive regulatory region of the bei-2 promoter in B cells and demonstrated that a CRE site mediates both basal expression and induction of the be/-2 promoter region in B cells following activation of PKC .
CREBs have been shown to mediate both constitutive and kinase-inducible gene expression ( 29 , 44 , 58 ) .
Although negative regulatory elements have been described ( 8 , 61 ) , this is the first 5554 WILSON ET AL .

report of a positive regulatory element in the be/-2 promoter .
The constitutive positive region is active in both pre-B and mature B cells .
We have previously demonstrated that the be/-2 promoter is repressed in pre-B cells by # 1-binding factors and that expression of be/-2 is low in pre-B cells ( 8 ) .
We describe two discrete positive regulatory regions , referred to as the URE and the DRE .
Our preliminary results demonstrate that deletions or additions of sequence between the two sites that disrupt the helical spacing lead to loss of activity .
Although we have not completed the characterization of the URE or identified the transcription factor that binds to the URE , it is possible that protein-protein interactions between CREB and the URE factor are important .
There are many examples of interactions between two regulatory elements that can be destroyed by a change in helical spacing ( 27 , 46 , 49 , 55 ) .
In addition , the CREB interacts with factors that bind to an adjacent AP-1 site in a manner dependent on helical spacing ( 24 ) .
The results of in vitro methylation analysis revealed that the bel-2 DRE consisted of two overlapping sites , CREO and bCRE .
Transient-transfection analysis revealed that the bCRE site was associated with most of the activity in this region .
EMSA with transcription factor antibodies , UV cross-linking followed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and het-erodimerization with a truncated CREB were performed to demonstrate that CREB family members bind to the bCRE site in vitro .
The presence of a CRE site in the be/-2 promoter implies that the regulation of be/-2 expression is linked to a signal transduction pathway in B cells .
be/-2 induction is seen in primary B cells with activation and presumably protects the cells from apoptosis .
It has been demonstrated that CREB can be phosphorylated and transcriptionally activated by PKC ( 59 ) .
PKC phosphorylates CREB in B cells ( 57 ) .
This is of interest because it may represent another pathway involved in the activation of B cells .
Cross-linking of surface Ig results in transactivation of a CRE-dependent promoter-CAT construct ( 56 ) .
Agents that increase cAMP levels did not activate the CRE-dependent promoter but could act synergistically with cross-linking of surface Ig .
We have shown that cross-linking of surface Ig receptor on mature B cells leads to increased be/-2 promoter activity through a PKC-dependent pathway involving phosphorylation of CREB .
This pathway may provide a mechanism for selection of long-lived antigen-reactive B cells by coupling antigen recognition to protection from apoptosis .
Reagents that in Vou .
16 , 1996 crease cAMP levels have no effect on the activity of the DRE , either alone or in combination with PMA or anti-Ig M. BAL-17 cells are derived from a malignant lymphoma and resemble partially activated mature B cells .
They express relatively high levels of be/-2 constitutively .
It is possible that the magnitude of induction of the be/-2 promoter would be greater in B cells that express lower levels of be/-2 such as resting , mature B cells .
In support of this , we find that the magnitude of induction of be/-2 expression after phorbol ester treatment of another mature B-cell line , DHL-9 , is approximately threefold greater than that seen in BAL-17 cells .
A dominant negative CREB construct interferes with the PMA-induced activation of the bei-2 promoter .
Cotransfection of a wild-type CREB construct increased the constitutive activity by twofold .
Stimulation with PMA resulted in a similar increase in activity of the be/-2 promoter whether wild-type CREB was cotransfected or not .
Since we find that 10 to 20 % of the CREBs present in DHL-9 cells are phosphorylated in response to PMA ( Fig .
8B and Western blotting data [ not shown ] ) , the increase in the level of unphosphorylated CREB may not result in more active phosphorylated CREB .
Therefore , no increase in promoter activity with PMA would be observed .
The dominant negative CREB appears to interfere with the function of the phosphorylated CREB , perhaps by forming inactive heterodimers .
We have demonstrated that a similar signal transduction pathway is involved in the up-regulation of be/-2 expression in immature B cells given a survival signal .
Treatment of Ramos cells with phorbol esters prevents apoptosis induced by ionomycin or by surface IgM cross-linking .
be/-2 mRNA is up-regulated , and we show that expression of the be/-2 promoter increases by 12-fold following phorbol ester treatment .
This increase in expression is dependent on the CRE site in the bel-2 promoter .
CREBs in phorbol ester-treated Ramos cells are phosphorylated by a pathway involving PKC .
These results are similar to those found in mature B cell lines and provide a demonstration of the physiological significance of signals through the be/-2 promoter CRE site .
We have shown that the CRE site mediates the PKC-dependent increase in be/-2 levels in B cells at two different stages of development .
It will be interesting to determine whether the CRE site plays a role in be/-2 induction in other cells in which Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis , including myeloid , breast , neural , and T cells .
Recent data have demonstrated that phosphorylation of CREBs during T-cell activation occurs in a cAMP-independent manner and that the phosphorylation of CREB is inhibited by rapamycin in T cells ( 15 ) .
In addition , be/-2 expression is inhibited by rapamycin ( 38 ) .
Our description of CRE site regulation of the be/-2 promoter suggests that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on be/-2 expression may be due to its interference with CREB phosphorylation in T cells .
Sim-ilarly , in a myeloid cell line that can be rescued from apoptosis by interleukin-3 , the interleukin-3 receptor modulates be/-2 mRNA through a PKC-dependent pathway ( 47 ) .
Our results raise the possibility that the PKC-CREB pathway we have identified is responsible for the induction of be/-2 mRNA in these cells .
It is intriguing to speculate that CREBs acting through the CRE site serve as a general mechanism for coupling surface receptor stimulation to protection from apoptosis by Bel-2 .
