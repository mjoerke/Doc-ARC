From §INSERM U462 , Institut d'Hématologie and |\Service de Recherches en Hemato Immunologie-CEA , Hopital Saint-Louis , 1 , avenue Claude-Vellefaux , 75010 Paris , France The serine protease granzyme B is an essential component of the granule exocytosis pathway , a major apoptotic mechanism used by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells to induce target cell apoptosis .
Granzyme B gene transcription is induced in activated lymphocytes upon antigenic stimulation , and several regulatory regions including CBF , AP-1 , and Ikaros binding sites have been shown to be essential in the control of granzyme B promoter activation .
Dexamethasone , a glucocorticoid that is widely used as an immunomodula-tory and anti-inflammatory agent , inhibits granzyme B mRNA transcript in phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
Transfection of a reporter construct containing the -148 to +60 region of the human granzyme B promoter demonstrated that this region was the target for dexamethasone repres-sion .
Mutation of Ikaros or AP-1 binding sites in the context of the granzyme B promoter demonstrated that both sites participate in dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of the granzyme B promoter activity .
Electromo-bility shift assay revealed that dexamethasone abolished the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros binding site and reduced AP-1 binding activity .
These results indicate that dexamethasone is able to abrogate the transcriptional activity of the human granzyme B gene promoter by inhibiting the binding of nuclear factors at the AP-1 and Ikaros sites .
Graft rejection remains a significant obstacle to successful allogeneic transplantation .
Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for allograft rejection is essential in developing new therapeutic approaches that will lead to successful allogeneic transplantation .
The immune effector cells responsible for this clinical syndrome are cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells .
Antigen-triggered T-cell activation induces a variety of molecular transduction signals that lead to the acquisition of a killing potential by these cells .
Two major pathways lead to the cell death of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocyte/granule-mediated exocytosis and the Fas/FasL interaction system .

35326 ural killer cells .
Upon specific recognition and T-cell activation by foreign antigens present on target cells , cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cells accumulate granules in their cytoplasm .
These granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin , which undergoes calcium-dependent polymerization on the target cell membrane , thereby forming a complement-like lesion ( 1 ) that facilitates delivery of the granule constituents , including granzymes , to the target cell cytoplasm .
Delivery of granule component proteins is required for the induction of apoptosis ( 2-4 ) .
Serine protease granzyme B is an essential mediator of early DNA fragmentation within the target cell in this pathway ( 5 ) and elicits apoptosis in target cell by initiating caspases activation ( 6-8 ) .
Targeted deletion of granzyme B and perforin genes in mice also demonstrated their role in graft rejection and graft versus host disease ( 9-11 ) .
In humans , the presence of activated T-cells expressing granzyme B and perforin has been observed in acute heart ( 12 ) , lung ( 13 ) , and kidney allograft rejections ( 14 , 15 ) .
Disease states in which T-cell and cytokine-mediated tissue damage predominate , including allograft rejection , autoimmune disease , and many cases of chronic inflammation and delayed hypersensitivity , are effectively treated with glucocorticoids .
Glucocorticoids have immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties and affect the growth , differentiation , and function of monocytes and lymphocytes .
The molecular basis of the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids is still not clearly understood .
Glucocorticoids modulate the production of various cyto-kines , including IL-1 ( 16 ) , IL-2 ( 17-20 ) , IL-4 ( 21 ) , IL-5 ( 22 ) , IL-8 ( 23 , 24 ) , interferon y ( 17 ) , and tumor necrosis factor a ( 25 ) , and can exert their effect by interfering with the action of transcription factors .
Glucocorticoids have been shown to repress AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation ( 26 ) and to impair NF- « B activation ( 27-80 ) .
NFAT , the nuclear factor of activated T-cells , has been described as a possible target for dexamethasone in thymocyte apoptosis ( 81 ) .
In a previous study , we observed that granzyme B expression could be down-regulated at the protein level in graft-infiltrat-ing lymphocytes in heart-transplanted patients with severe and mild rejection under corticoid treatment ( 32 ) .
This effect , which could be reversible , coincided with graft stabilization and preceded the complete disappearance of cellular infiltration ( 82 ) .

In this study we have examined the molecular basis of the previously mentioned down-regulation of lytic protein expression by glucocorticoids .
In both humans and mice , the granzyme B gene is not expressed in resting T-cells but is induced at the transcription level 24 to 72 h after T-cell activation ( 83 , 34 ) .
The DNA regulatory element that controls the level of granzyme B gene transcription in activated T-cells resides between nucleotides -148 and + 60 ( relative to the transcriptional start point +1 ) of the human granzyme B gene promoter ( 35 ) .
This proximal promoter region contains Ikaros and AP-1/ CBF binding sites , previously shown to be essential in human and mouse granzyme B promoter activation for T-cell stimulation ( 36-38 ) .
In this report , we examine the effects of the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone on the transcriptional activity and DNA binding pattern of the human granzyme B gene promoter in PHA-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) .
We present evidence that dexamethasone significantly decreases the activation of granzyme B transcription in these PHA-activated cells .
The -148 to +60 region of the granzyme B promoter is identified as a target for this suppression .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that dexamethasone abolished the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros and AP-1 sites of the promoter , whereas CBF binding remained unaffected .
We show here for the first time that dexamethasone has an inhibitory effect on the binding of nuclear factors to the Ikaros and AP-1 regulatory elements of the human granzyme B promoter in PHA-activated PBMCs .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture-A buffy coat of human PBMCs was purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation .
PBMCs were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) supplemented with 10 % inacti-vated human serum and activated with PHA at a final concentration of 15 ug/ml , 2 h before the addition of dexamethasone at various concentrations ( 1 uM , 100 nM , and 10 nM ) .
RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization-Total cellular RNA was extracted by immediate solubilization of PBMCs in guanidium isothiocyanate according to the method of Chomezynski and Sacchi ( 89 ) .
After electrophoresis of 10 pug of each RNA through a 1 % agarose formaldehyde gel , transfer to a Hybond N nitrocellulose membrane was carried out ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
A granzyme B *°P-labeled RNA probe was prepared using the sp6 RNA polymerase as described previously ( 40 ) .
Hybridization was carried out with this probe and visualized by autoradiography .
To verify equal loading of RNA , the membrane was also hybridized with *°P-labeled human B-actin cDNA ( CLONTECH ) .

RESULTS Dexamethasone Partially Abrogated the Stimulatory Effect of PHA on Human Granzyme B mRNA Expression-Granzyme B mRNAs expression was studied by Northern blot analysis of total RNA samples extracted from unstimulated and PHA-stimulated PBMCs .
As expected ( 34 ) , no expression was found in resting cells , whereas granzyme B transcripts were detected in PHA-stimulated cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
The addition of dexamethasone abrogated the induction of human granzyme B messenger RNA expression , which was observed after PHA stimulation of PBMCs ( Fig .
1 ) .
CD8* T lymphocytes , which expressed a higher granzyme B level than CD4* T lymphocytes , are highly sensitive to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis ( 46 ) .

Inhibition of granzyme B RNA expression by Dex .
Total RNA from resting PBMCs , PHA-stimulated PBMCs , and PHA-stimulated PBMCs treated with 1 uM of Dex were successively hybridized with a granzyme B riboprobe ( see `` Experimental Procedures '' ) and B actin cDNA .
nate the possibility of dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of granzyme B transcription because of apoptosis of CD8* cells , the CD4*/CD8* ratio before and after dexamethasone treatment was analyzed by cytofluorometry .
No difference in this ratio could be demonstrated ( data not shown ) .
PHA Activation of the Granzyme B Promoter Was Down-regulated by Dexamethasone in Primary Human PBMCs-To determine whether one of the possible mechanisms of dexamethasone inhibition of granzyme B mRNA induction involved a change in the transcriptional activity of the human granzyme B promoter , we transiently transfected PHA-activated PBMCs with a vector in which the CAT reporter gene transcription was under the control of the human granzyme B gene proximal promoter ( -148 to + 60 ) ( 35 , 36 ) .
The CAT activity driven by the reporter fragment was significantly inhibited by treatment with three different concentrations of dexamethasone ( 1 uM , 100 nm , and 10 nx ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
Dexamethasone was thus found to inhibit granzyme B promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner .
Binding of Nuclear Proteins from Stimulated Primary Human PBMCs to the Ikaros GBI and AP-1 GB2 Sites of the Granzyme B Promoter was Inhibited by Dexamethasone-We investigated whether dexamethasone inhibited granzyme B gene transcription by interfering with nuclear proteins that bind to the human granzyme B promoter .
We have previously shown that the Ikaros binding site GB1 ( -143 to -114 ) and the AP-1/CBF binding site GB2 ( -103 to -77 ) were essential for the activation of transcription in PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 36 ) .
Nuclear extracts from PHA-stimulated PBMCs were analyzed by mobility shift assays with GB1 and GB2 probes , and the consensus Ikaros binding site was derived from the mouse CD3 8-chain gene enhancer ( 42 ) .
These results revealed that dexamethasone inhibited the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros GB1 site ( Fig .
3A ) as well as to the consensus Ikaros binding site ( Fig .
3B , IK ) and reduced AP-1 binding activity , whereas CBF binding activity to the GB2 site remained unaffected ( Fig .
4 ) .
Both Ikaros and AP-1 Binding Sites Participate in Dexamethasone-mediated Inhibition of Granzyme B Promoter Activ-ity-Two binding sites , the Ikaros and AP-1/CBF binding sites , have been demonstrated to be essential for granzyme B promoter activation ( 36-38 ) .
To further evaluate the contribution of these sites to the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on the granzyme B promoter , we introduced mutations able to selectively abolish binding of complexes to the Ikaros , AP-1 , or AP-1/CBF sites in the context of the granzyme B promoter ( 36 ) .
To gain sensibility in this analysis , these granzyme B promoter constructs were introduced in a luciferase promoterless reporter construct .
As shown in Fig .
5A , the transcriptional activity of the granzyme B promoter in PHA-stimulated PBMCs was significantly inhibited by dexamethasone .

Dexamethasone inhibits the PHA-mediated transacti-vation of the human granzyme B promoter .
PBMCs were activated with PHA at a final concentration of 15 ug/ml with or without Dex at different concentrations ( 1 uM , 100 nM , and 10 nM ) .
After 48 h of culture , 10 '' cells were transfected with 10 ug of the plasmid CATS8A or PBLCAT3 .
CAT activity was assayed 24 h later .

The CAT38 is vector without promoter .
abolished the binding of the nuclear factors on the Ikaros binding site partially reduced the granzyme B promoter activity in PHA-activated cells , but treatment with dexamethasone was still able to modulate the residual luciferase activity driven by the Ikaros-mutated promoter fragment .
This result is in favor of a role for the AP-1 binding site in dexamethasone-mediated inhibition .
Mutations of the AP-1/CBF binding site or selective mutations of the AP-1 binding site also reduced the level of granzyme B promoter activity in PHA-activated cells .
An inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on the mutated promoter containing an intact Ikaros binding site was still ob-served , confirming the role of the Ikaros regulatory element in dexamethasone-mediated inhibition .
Similar results were obtained by insertion of a limited region of the granzyme B promoter ( -148 to -77 ) , which only contains wild type or mutated Ikaros and AP-1/CBF binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter in the pGL3 vector ( data not shown ) .
Altogether these data show that the two DNA binding sites , Ikaros and AP-1 , both represent critical regulatory targets for dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of the granzyme B promoter .
Considering the critical role of the AP-1 binding site , we tested the effect of cotransfection of a c-Jun expression vector on the dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of the granzyme B promoter .
As shown in Fig .
5B , cotransfection of c-Jun expression vector partially restores PHA activation of the granzyme B promoter in presence of dexamethasone .
In addition , the cotransfection experiment with c-Jun can not reverse glucocorti-coid-mediated repression of CAT2AM2 ( 77 ) , corresponding to mutation on the AP-1/CBF binding site with an intact Ikaros binding site but is very potent at reversing repression of CAT2AMI ( 77 ) , corresponding to the mutation in the Ikaros binding site with an intact AP-1/CBF binding site ( Fig .
5C ) .
These results show that c-Jun cotransfection has no effect on the Ikaros binding site activity .
The Dex treatment and the c-Jun cotransfection have no effect on the PBLCAT2 vector activity ( data not shown ) .
As potential candidate proteins that could interact with the granzyme B Ikaros regulatory element , we studied the effect of dexamethasone on Ikaros protein expression in PHA-activated PBMCs .
Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts revealed that dexamethasone treatment is associated with a moderate decrease of the bands whose size correspond to Ik1 and Ik2/3 isoforms ( 45 , 47 , 48 ) and apparition of a band with a smaller 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Down-regulation of Granzyme B Transcription by Dexamethasone PHA 4+ +0 4+ ++ Dex _ 10nM 100nM .L _ Competitor .

In contrast , the expression of Ikaros proteins was unchanged by the dexamethasone treatment in whole extracts ( data not shown ) .
These results suggested that dexamethasone modulates protein nuclear expression of Ikaros isoforms .

shown ) , suggesting that overexpression of these isoforms per se is not able to counterbalance the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone .
DISCUSSION Although glucocorticoids are among the most potent and widely used immunosuppressive agents , the mechanisms by which they suppress the immune response have not yet been clearly defined .
Glucocorticoids have been shown to be able to affect monocyte and T lymphocyte proliferation and function ( 49-51 ) .
The main mechanism by which they exert their powerful effects is modulation of the expression of specific sets of genes ( 49 ) .
Glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit cytokine expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels .
Recently , in addition to its distal effect on gene expression , dexamethasone has been described as down-regulating T-cell activation by inhibiting the transduction of activation signals initiated upon T-cell receptor occupancy ( 52 ) and IL-2 receptor ( 53 , 54 ) .
In contrast to IL-2 and interferon y gene expression , which are early events in T-cell activation , induction of granzyme B gene transcription is a late-phase event that characterizes the acquisition of the cytotoxic function by T lymphocytes .
The results of this study demonstrated that inhibition of late-phase granzyme B gene expression by glucocorticoids occurred at the transcriptional level , resulting in a concentration-dependent inhibition of granzyme B gene promoter activity .
Glucocorticoids exert their effects after diffusing into target cells , where they bind to their cytoplasmic receptor .
This complex then translocates to the nucleus , where it inhibits the transcription of target genes .
This inhibition can occur through direct binding to the glucocorticoid response elements , located within the promoter region of the genes ( 55 ) .
No differential DNA binding activity to putative glucocorticoid receptor element sites identified within the granzyme B promoter by sequence homologies to glucocorticoid receptor element consensus sequences could be detected ( data not shown ) .

involve antagonism of the action of transcription factors required for transcriptional activation have been described ( 55 ) .
Inhibition of IL-2 gene transcription is thought to be the consequence of negative interference with AP-1 and NFAT ( nucle-ar factor of activated T-cells ) nuclear transcriptional factors , which have been previously demonstrated to be of crucial importance for the activity of this cytokine promoter ( 18 , 19 ) .
Although AP-1 is involved in lymphokine gene induction , interference with AP-1 activity can not account for the full spectrum of immunoregulatory genes affected by glucocorticoids .
More recently , glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit the activity of the NF- « B transcription factor by increasing transcription and protein synthesis of its cytoplasmic inhibitor IxBa ( 27 , 29 ) .
Previous studies have shown that dexamethasone represses the DNA binding activity of nuclear NF-kB ( 28 , 30 ) .
Glucocorticoid suppression of a member of the rat IL-8 family is also mediated by impairment of NF- « B activation ( 24 ) .
In this report , we demonstrate that dexamethasone inhibits granzyme B gene promoter activity induction by interfering with the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros GBI site and by reducing the amount of AP-1 binding activity while not affecting CBF binding activity to the GB2 site .
The mechanism by which AP-1 is inhibited by glucocorticoids is well documented and implicates interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and Jun and Fos , the two proteins that transactivate transcription when binding to the AP-1 site ( 26 , 56-59 ) .
In fact , in our model , Fos protein nuclear expression is not down-regulated by dexamethasone ( data not shown ) .
The role of an Ikaros binding site in the dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of gene transcription has not yet been described .
Candidate proteins that could bind the granzyme B Ikaros site are the different isoforms ( Ik1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) encoded by the Ikaros gene ( 45 , 47 , 48 ) , an essential regulator of lymphocyte differentiation ( 42 , 60 ) .
Ikaros activity is controlled by the nature of the complexes formed between its expressed isoforms ( 61 ) .
Homo- and heterodimer formation between the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms ( Ik1 , 2 , and 3 ) greatly increases their affinity for DNA and their consequent ability to activate transcription .
Heterodimers formed between isoforms Ik1 , 2 , and 3 with Ik4 , 5 , and 6 lead to transcriptionally inactive forms ( 61 ) .
Hence , heterodimers that include one Ikaros isoform that lacks a DNA binding domain are transcriptionally inert .
The observation of a new band detected by Western blot using the anti-Ikaros antibody with nuclear extracts upon dexamethasone treatment is compatible with the expression of such an isoform lacking the DNA binding domain .
As recently sug-gested , such isoforms could interfere with the activity of Ikaros or Ikaros-like binding factors such as Aiolos , Helios , p30 ( 62 , 63 ) , or other yet-undefined partners in a dominant negative 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Down-regulation of Granzyme B Transcription by Dexamethasone fashion .
Dexamethasone treatment could generate the presence in the nucleus of a dominant negative isoform .
This interpretation is compatible with the absence of retarded bound complexes in bandshift assay .
Morever , our preliminary results are not in favor of an enhancement of granzyme B promoter activity consecutive to independent cotransfection of recombi-nant Ik1 and Ik2 isoforms .
This suggests that other lineage-specific partners may interact with the granzyme B Ikaros regulatory element .
Further analyses are necessary to elucidate dexamethasone inhibition mechanisms involving the Ikaros regulatory element .
In conclusion , we have demonstrated that Ikaros and AP-1 binding sites of the human granzyme B promoter are both critical for the dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of the granzyme B gene expression .
