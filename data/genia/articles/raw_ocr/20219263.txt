Koelle* Ag-specific CD4 * T cells are present in peripheral blood in low frequency , where they undergo recruitment and expansion during immune responses and in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases .
MHC tetramers , which constitute a labeled MHC-peptide ligand suitable for binding to the Ag-specific receptor on T cells , provide a novel approach for the detection and characterization of such rare cells .
In this study , we utilized this technology to identify HLA DQ-restricted Ag-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of human subjects and to identify immunodominant epitopes associated with viral infection .
Peptides representing potential epitope regions of the VP16 protein from HSV-2 were loaded onto recombinant DQ0602 molecules to generate a panel of Ag-specific DQ0602 tetramers .
VP16 Ag-specific DQ-restricted T cells were identified and expanded from the peripheral blood of HSV-2-infected individuals , representing two predominant epitope specificities .
Although the VP16 369-380 peptide has a lower binding affinity for DQ0602 molecules than the VP16 33-52 peptide , T cells that recognized the VP16 369-380 peptide occurred at a much higher frequency than those that were specific for the VP16 33-52 peptide .

Techniques of T cell cloning and limiting dilution assays have been successfully applied to the detection and isolation of peripheral blood T cells that are restricted by HLA-DR molecules .
T cells that are restricted by DQ and DP molecules generally occur at a lower frequency than those restricted by DR and are less well characterized .
DQ-restricted T cells are of special interest in that autoimmune diseases including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , celiac disease , and pemphigus vulgaris are associated with specific HLA-DQ alleles ( 1-4 ) .
Recently , MHC tetramer technology has been developed to detect T cells .
This technology utilizes specific , labeled MHC-pep-tide complexes to detect Ag-specific T cells by direct binding of the TCR complex , with visualization by fluorescence flow cytometry .
This has been successful in a variety of studies focused on the identification of CD8 * class L-restricted T cells ( 5-10 ) , whereas analysis of CD4 * class II-restricted T cells has been much more elusive .
Most class II MHC tetramers studies are limited to murine class II molecules ( 11-13 ) .

The low frequency of Ag-specific peripheral T cells in humans and concerns related to the stability of soluble class II molecules have challenged the development of this technology , particularly with HLA-DQ molecules , in which the molecules are unstable compared with HLA-DR ( 15 , 16 ) .
We now report the development of class II peptide-tetramers that detect human peripheral blood T cells restricted by HLA-DQ molecules in Ag-specific immune responses to HSV-2 .
Materials and Methods Patient population Patients were HSV-2-infected individuals who visit the outpatient sexually transmitted disease clinics of the University of Washington Medical Cen-ter .
HSV-2 infection was confirmed by HSV type-specific immunoblot ( 17 ) .
All patients were asymptomatic when their PBMC were obtained for these studies .
HLA-DR and DQ typing were performed by reverse dot blot hybridization ( 18 ) .
Isolation and characterization of DQO6O02-restricted T cells PBMC from HSV-2-seropositive individual 5491 ( HLA-DRB1*1501 , *0301 and DQB1*0602 , ©0201 ) were plated at 2 X 10° cells/well in a 24-well plate in medium consisting of RPMI and 15 % heat-inactivated pooled human serum .
Cells were stimulated with VP16 protein ( gift from Chiron , Emeryville CA ) at 2 ug/ml .
Starting on day 5 , cells were fed every other day with fresh medium and IL-2 ( Hemagen , Worcester MA ) at a concentration of 16 U/ml .
On day 12 , cells were washed and plated at 1 cell/well in a 96-well U-bottom plate which also contained 1.5 X 10° irradiated ( 3300 rad ) autologous PBMC and 0.8 pg/ml PHA .
IL-2 was added 48 h later .
At day 26 , cells from each positive well were evaluated for Ag-specific proliferation in the presence of 2 ug/ml VP16 and L-243 ( anti-DR ) or SPVL-3 ( anti-DQ ) at 5 ug/ml , with 1 X 10° irradiated PBMC from an HLA haplotype-matched individual as APC ( HLA-DRB1*0101 , *1501 and DQB1*0501 , # 0602 ) .
After 48 h , ( 1 was added for 16 h , and cells were then harvested and counted .
Cells that proliferated in the presence of L-243 and that were inhibited by SPVL-3 were selected for epitope specificity .

The peptides were synthesized by Multipin peptide technology ( Chiron Technologies , Clayton , Australia ) .
For the proliferation assays , triplicate wells contained 10* T cells , 10° irradiated PBMC ( DRB1*0101/1501 , DQB1*0501/0602 ) , and 1 M peptide in 200 ul T cell medium in 96-well U-bottom plates .
After 48 h , 1 Ci [ °H ] thymidine was added , and the cells were harvested and counted after an additional 16 h. Construction of DQO6O2-leucine zipper-biotinylation site expression vectors Chimeric cassettes containing the coding regions for the HLA-DQ extra-cellular domain/leucine zipper ( LZ ) ® molecules were made using a PCR-mediated splicing overlap extension technique ( 19 ) .
Plasmids pN15LZa and pLN15LZf were gifts from Dr. D. Ostrov and Dr. S. Nathenson , Mt .
Sinai Medical School ( New York , NY ) .
For generation of the soluble DQA1 chain , cDNA of DQA1*0102 was amplified in the first round using the primer pair , ( + ) 5-GGAATTCATGATCCTAAACAAAGCTCT-3 ' and ( - ) 5'-CCAGGTCTGCTGACGACTCTGTGAGCTCTGACATAG-3 ' ( sharing homology with the 5 ' end of basic LZ ) at a concentration of 4 nM for each primer .
For the second round amplification , the first round product was used as the initial ( + ) primer on the pN15LZa template containing the basic LZ cDNA motif at a concentration of 10 pM to form a DQA1*0102/LZ chimera .
The primer pair , ( + ) 5'-GGAATTCATGATCCTAAACAAAGCTCT-3 ' and ( = ) 5'-CTGGTACCATCCTACTGGGCGAGTT-3 ' ( sharing homology with the 3 ' end of LZ ) , was then used to amplify the chimera .
The fragment was TA cloned into pCR2.1Topo ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) sequenced and then subcloned into the metal inducible Drosophila expression vector pRmHa-3 ( gift from Dr. L. S. B. Goldstein , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , La Jolla , CA ) using EcoRI and KpnI sites engineered into the second round primer pair ( underlined above ) .
For generation of the soluble DQB1 chain , cDNA of DQB1*0602 was initially amplified using the primer pair , ( + ) 5'-ACCTCGAGGTCT CAATTATGTC-3 ' and ( - ) GGCAGA-3 ' ( sharing homology with the 5 ' end of acidic LZ ) at a concentration of 4 nM .
For the second round amplification , the first round product was used as the initial ( + ) primer on the pN15LZB template containing the acidic LZ cDNA motif at a concentration of 10 pM to form a DQB1*0602/LZ chimera .
The primer pair , ( + ) 5'- ACCTCGAGGTCT CAATTATGTC-3 ' and ( - ) 5'-ACAAGCTTCCCTGAGCCAGTTCC TTTTCC-3 ' ( sharing homology with the 3 ' end of the acidic LZ ) , was then used to amplify the chimera .
This DQ cassette was then cloned into vector pAC1 ( Avidity , Denver , CO ) , using the XhoI and HindIII sites ( underlined above ) , 5 ' of the biotinylation sequence ; the complete DQB1*0602-LZ biotinylation site cassette was then recovered by PCR amplification with the primer pair , ( + ) 5-AGAATTCGTCTCAATTATGTCTTGGAA-3 ' and 5'-CTGGTACCTTAGTGCCATTCGATTTTCTG-3 ' , and TA was cloned into pCR2.1Topo , sequenced , and then subcloned into the Drosophila expression vector pRmHa-3 using EcoRI and KprI ( sites underlined ) .
Generation of DQO6O2 tetramers The DQA1 and DQB1 chimeric cDNAs in the Schneider expression vector pRmHa-3 were cotransfected with the phshsneo plasmid ( gift from Dr. M. McKeown , Salk Institute , San Diego , CA ) into S-2 Schneider cells ( gift from Dr. D. Zaller , Merck Research Laboratories , Rahway , NJ ) by standard calcium phosphate transfection techniques .
Cells were selected with G418 at 2 mg/ml ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Cells were expanded and were grown to a density of 1 X 10 '' cells/ml .
CuSO , was added to a concentration of 1 mM to induce the production of class II molecules .
The DQ0602 molecules from the supernatant were purified by affinity chroma-tography using SPVL-3 as previously described ( 20 ) .
The class II molecules were concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml and then dia-lyzed in 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , 10 mM NaCl .
The protein was then biotinylated by using the Bir A enzyme according to the manufacturer 's conditions ( Avidity , Denver , CO ) .
The excess biotin was removed by dialysis .
The biotinylated DQ0602 molecules were then loaded with the appropriate peptides at a 10-fold molar excess of peptide over class II molecules .
Loading was conducted at 37°C for 72 h in a 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 6 , with 0.25 % n-octylglucopyranoside ( 20 ) .
Class II tetramers were generated by incubating an 8-fold molar excess of loaded biotinylated class II molecules with PE-streptavidin ( BioSource International , Camarillo , CA ) at room temperature for 4 h. ° Abbreviations used in this paper : LZ , leucine zipper ; CFSE , 5- ( and -6 ) -carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidy ] ester ; LCL , lymphoblastoid cell line .
4245 Tetramer analysis of T cell clones and PBMC T cell clones were incubated at 37°C for 1-2 h in 50 pl media with 20 pug/tal tetramers/5 X 10° cells CD4-Cychrome or CD4-PerCP ( Phar-Mingen , San Diego , CA ) was added at the end of tetramer staining and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature .
The cells were washed twice with PBS + 1 % FBS before analysis by a Becton Dickinson FACSort .
For staining of PBMC , 2 X 10° nylon wool-purified T cells were stimulated with VP16 protein at 2 ug/ml with autologous adherent PBMC as APC .
Adherent PBMC were prepared by plating out PBMC at 5 X 10° cells/well in a 24-well plate .
Cells were allowed to adhere overnight , and nonadherent cells were removed with a plastic pipette .
The nonadherent cells were passed through a nylon wool column , and cells eluted from the column were used as nylon wool-purified T cells .
Starting at day 5 , and every other day , IL-2 was added to a final concentration of 10 U/ml .
The T cells were stained with DQ0602/peptide tetramers 10 days later .
Measurement of cell divisions and precursor frequency PBMC were stained with 0.8 M 5- ( and -6 ) -carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidy ] ester ( CFSE ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for 10 min at 37°C .
Staining was stopped by adding 100 % FBS and subsequently washing the cells twice in RPMI culture media .
Cells were then plated at 3 % 10° cells/well in 24-well plates and stimulated with 2 ug/ml VP16 protein overnight .
Cells were stained for surface markers and with DQ0602/369-380 tetramers or control tetramers and analyzed by FACS after 10 days in culture .
A portion of the CFSE-stained cells was polyclonally stimulated with 2.5 pg/ml PHA and 10 U IL-2 and also analyzed by FACS on day 10 .
Stimulation of T cells with PHA and IL-2 results in cell division with distinct CFSE fluorescence peaks , allowing determination of the mean CFSE fluorescence for each generation .
These values were used to calculate the average number of cell divisions in cells stimulated with specific Ag .
Precursor frequency was estimated by dividing the fraction of tetramer-positive cells by 2* , where x is the average number of cell divisions as calculated by CFSE fluorescence .
Peptide binding assays Competition peptide binding assays with purified DQ0602 were conducted as previously described ( 20 ) .
The reaction mixtures consisted of 25 nM purified DQ0602 , 0.1 M biotinylated IA-2 499-509 peptide , and various concentrations of nonbictinylated VP16 369-380 or VP16 33-52 peptides .
The peptide/class II complexes were captured on a SPVL-3-coated plate and measured by a europium-labeled streptavidin assay using a Delfia 1232 fluorometer ( Wallac , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
The IC , , was determined by plotting a curve and extrapolating the concentration at which 50 % inhibition occurs .
Analysis of TCR genes mRNA was prepared from T cell clones using the Quick Prep Micro RNA Purification Kit ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) .
cDNA synthesis was conducted using the Superscript Preamplification system ( Life Technolo-gies ) .
TCR VB gene usage was determined by PCR amplification of cDNA using a set of 5° VB 1-23 primers and 3'-constant region primers as described ( 21 ) .
Results and Discussion Identification of VP16 epitopes recognized by HLA-DQ-restricted T cell responses The tegument protein VP16 of HSV-2 virus is one of the major proteins recognized as a viral Ag in HSV-2-infected subjects ( 22 ) .
Forty-eight T cell clones were isolated from peripheral blood of an HSV-2-infected individual that were specific for the HSV-2 VP16 protein .
Proliferation assays in the presence of either an anti-DR or anti-DQ Ab indicated that seven of these clones were restricted by DQ0602 , the only DQ molecule in common to both the responders and the APC ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Fig .
1 illustrates the proliferation of two of these T cell clones , c5 and c44 , in the presence of VP16 protein and BLS-DQ0602 B-lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL ) as APC .
The BLS-DQ0602 LCL is an EBV-trans-formed human B cell line that was transfected with DQ genes and had DQO0602 as the only expressed class II molecule ( 16 ) , confirming that DQO0602 was the restriction element for these T cell clones .
To determine the dominant DQ0602-restricted epitope for the VP16 protein , all 7 T cell clones were screened with a panel of 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 4246 clone c5 50000 as o =i o = ] 30000 [ °H ] Thymidine incorporation ( cpm ) pmed : 0 no VP16 VP16 HLA-DQ TETRAMERS DETECT HSV-2-SPECIFIC T CELLS clone c44 75000 ing 50000 [ °H ] Thymid incorporation ( cpm ) 25000 no VP16 VP16 FIGURE 1 .

After 48 h , 1 mCi [ H ] thymidine was added , and the cells were harvested and counted 16 h later .
60 overlapping peptides that covered the entire VP16 protein .
Six of the seven DQ-restricted clones , c5 , c8 , c31 , c48 , c68 , and ©73 , were specific for both peptides 361-380 ( AYSRGRTRNNYGSTIEGLLD ) and 369-388 ( NNYGSTIEGLLDLPDDDDAP ) .
Truncation analysis of the peptides indicated that all 6 clones recognize peptide 369-380 ( NNYGSTIEGLLD ) .
The other clone , c44 , was shown to recognize the VP16 peptide 33-52 ( PPLYATGRLSQAQLMPSPPM ) .
The reactivity profiles of clone c5 and c44 to the panel of overlapping VP16 peptides are shown in Fig .
2 .
TCR VB transcripts in clones that recognized 369-380 were identified by RT-PCR analysis using a set of VB primers .
Two different VB-chains were identified : clones c5 , c8 , c31 , and c68 used V 6.5 ; and clones c48 and c73 used VB 13.2 .
DQ0602/peptide tetramers were generated with either the 33-52 peptide or the 369-380 peptide as described in Materials and Methods and incubated with T cell clones c5 and c44 .
As shown in Fig .
3 , tetramer staining was specific for T cells with corresponding functional specificity : Clone c5 T cells , which proliferated to peptide 369-380 , could be stained only by the DQO0602 tetramers loaded with peptide 369-380 but not by the tetramers loaded with peptide 33-52 , whereas clone c44 T cells , which proliferated to peptide 33-52 , could be stained only by tetramers loaded with peptide 33-52 .

T cells identified by both the DQ0602/369-380 and DQ0602/33-52 tetramers were detected ( Fig .

T cells that stained with the DQ0602/369-380 tetramers were observed at a higher frequency ( 3.3 % ) than the T cells stained with the DQ0602/33-52 tetramers ( 0.6 % ) .
This observation was consistent with the observation in T cell cloning that clones specific for epitope 369-380 were observed at a much higher frequency than the 33-52 epitope .
Similar staining patterns with the DQ0602/369-380 tetramers were also observed with peripheral blood T cells from two additional HSV-2 infected individuals who carried the DQ0602 haplotype : 5624 ( DRB1*1501/1101 , DQB1*0602/0301 ) and 5633 ( DRB1*1501 , /0801 , DQB 1*0602/0402 ) ( Fig .

T cells corresponding to the 33-52 epitope were not detected in these two individuals .
Analysis with the DQ0602/369-380 and 33-52 tetramers was Ag and MHC specific .
No staining with either tetramer was detected in HSV-2-infected individual 5707 ( DRB1*O0101/1101 , DQB1*0501/ 0301 ) who did not carry the DQ0602 allele or in HLA-DQ0602 HSV-2 serological negative individual 5001 ( DRB1*1501/0301 , DQB1*0602/0201 ) ( Fig .

Percentages shown in the margins represent the percent of total cells present in each quadrant .
we combined the use of specific tetramer staining with another fluorescent-based technique that quantitates cell divisions .
As shown in Fig .

The mean CFSE fluorescence of these cells corresponds to ~10 cell divisions .
The observed frequency of 2.1 % for tetramer-positive cells after 10 cell divisions indicates an initial precursor frequency of 0.002 % .
Peptide binding affinity and T cell epitope Peptide binding studies for the DQ0602 molecule were performed to compare the class II-peptide avidity of the two VP16 epitopes , 369-380 and 33-52 .
As shown in Fig .

Because this binding avidity is inversely related to the frequency of epitope-specific T cells observed , this indicates that the relative higher frequency of 369-380 T cells was not directly due to a high affinity of 369-380 for DQO0602 but likely results from a more 0 in 4000 -- VP16 33-52 = -- + -- VP16 369-380 35 30000 ® o C 8 20000 t © 0 2 10000 IL 0~ p t 1 t : 0.001 _ 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 peptide concentration in uM FIGURE 6 .

complex set of parameters associated with selection of immunodominant epitopes , possibly including differential T cell selection or variable processing of the VP16 protein , enabling the 369-380 epitope to be preferentially processed compared with the 33-52 epitope .
This is compatible with x-ray crystallography structural studies in which the carboxyl-terminal region of the VP16 protein has a disordered structure ( 23 ) , potentially allowing this region easy access to protease and capture by class II molecules .
This is also consistent with a general property of this part of the VP16 molecule , rather than specific for DQ0602 determinant selection , because previous studies have also demonstrated that the carboxyl terminal of the VP16 contained numerous T cell epitopes ( 22 ) .
HLA-DQ TETRAMERS DETECT HSV-2-SPECIFIC T CELLS Fluorescence-activated cell sorting with DQ tetramers The specificity of T cells detected with the DQ0602/369-380 tetramer was further confirmed by isolating the cells sorted by flow cytometry .
T cells positively stained with the DQ0602/369-380 tetramer were FACS sorted and cloned at 3 cells/well ; the sorted T cells were then expanded by PHA in the presence of IL-2 to generate 47 cell lines .
Staining with tetramers and proliferation assays with the 369-380 peptide are summarized in Table I. Thirty-six cell lines were positive for the staining and the proliferation as-says ; 11 lines were negative for both staining and the proliferation assays .
Thus , 77 % of the sorted T cells were specific for the VP16 369-380 peptide as assayed by tetramer staining and proliferation , compared with 2-3 % T cells staining with the tetramer in the original unsorted sample .
This confirms the Ag-specific properties of peripheral blood T cells detected using tetramer staining .
The less then perfect correlation between the sorted cells and reactivity to the VP16 peptide was probably due to nonstringent fluorometry settings for the T cell population , which was gated for 1 % positive cells .
The overall fluorescence intensity as shown in Table I for these cell lines was variable , due to heterogeneity in the cell population .
There was no correlation between the extent of proliferation and the intensity of the fluorescence signal .
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using MHC class II tetramers to directly visualize a small cohort of Ag-specific DQ-restricted T cells from peripheral blood .
A broad spectrum of class II tetrameric complexes can potentially be generated fairly easily by loading peptides into class II molecules by the technique illus-trated .
In this regard , this study is more similar to previous work with MHC class I tetramers , which are conventionally loaded with peptide during purification and refolding , and distinct from studies with murine class II tetramers which have utilized covalent peptide tethered to single MHC molecules ( 11 , 12 ) .
Using specific tetramer detection , the precursor frequency of HSV-2-specific , DQ-restricted T cells was highest for the VP16 369-380 epitope compared with the 33-52 epitope , illustrating the importance of direct measurement of Ag-specific T cells compared with inferences about immunodominance derived solely from peptide-MHC binding studies .
This study also demonstrates a rapid and sensitive approach for cloning specific T cells from human peripheral blood utilizing FACS sorting of tetramer-positive cells as a first step .
In view of the limited data on DQ-restricted T cells , the use of tetrameric DQ reagents should provide valuable insight regarding the role of DQ-restricted CD4 * T cells in both abnormal and normal immune regulation .
