5 Identification of an Inducible Regulator of c-myb Expression during T-Cell Activation SEE-CHUN PHAN , BRIAN FEELEY , DONALD WITHERS , f anp LINDA M. BOXER * Center for Molecular Biology in Medicine , Palo Alto VAMC , Palo Alto , California 94304 , and Department of Medicine , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 Received 20 December 1995/Returned for modification 12 February 1996/Accepted 29 February 1996 Resting T cells express very low levels of c-Myb protein .
During T-cell activation , c-myb expression is induced and much of the increase in expression occurs at the transcriptional level .
We identified a region of the c-myb 5 ' flanking sequence that increased c-myb expression during T-cell activation .
In vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR was performed to correlate in vivo protein binding with functional activity .
A protein footprint was visible over this region of the c-myb 5 ' flanking sequence in activated T cells but not in unactivated T cells .
An electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with nuclear extract from activated T cells and an oligonucleotide of this binding site demonstrated a new protein-DNA complex , referred to as CMAT for c-myb in activated T cells ; this complex was not present in unactivated T cells .
Because the binding site showed some sequence similarity with the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) binding site , we compared the kinetics of induction of the two binding complexes and the molecular masses of the two proteins .
Studies of the kinetics of induction showed that the NFAT EMSA binding complex appeared earlier than the CMAT complex .
The NFAT protein migrated more slowly in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel than the CMAT protein did .
In addition , an antibody against NFAT did not cross-react with the CMAT protein .
The appearance of the CMAT binding complex was inhibited by both cyclosporin A and rapamycin .
The CMAT protein appears to be a novel inducible protein involved in the regulation of c-myb expression during T-cell activation .
Interaction of antigen with the antigen receptor of T lymphocytes initiates a series of changes resulting in cell division and immunologic function .
The antigen receptor rapidly induces the production of cytokines that control cell proliferation , cell fate decisions , and the differentiation of B cells , granulocytes , macrophages , and other cell types involved in the immune response ( 3 , 13 , 30 ) .
A number of genes are activated in T cells , including the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myh ( 17 , 33 ) .
The products of these genes provide a link with surface receptor-mediated activation events and prepare the cell for subsequent DNA replication and proliferation .
The interleukin-2 gene is active only in T cells that have been stimulated through the antigen receptor , and it plays a major role in T-cell proliferation .
The induction of the interleukin-2 gene is mediated by a transcription factor , the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) ( 9 , 35 , 40 ) .
The NFAT complex is found in nuclei of activated T cells ; it binds to the promoter of the interleukin-2 gene and transmits signals initiated at the T-cell antigen receptor .
NFAT is assembled from a preexisting , T-cell-restricted cytoplasmic factor and an inducible ubiquitous nuclear component consisting of API factors within 30 min after activation of the antigen receptor ( 10 , 29 ) .
The cytoplasmic component ( NFAT ) is translocated to the nucleus in response to calcium signaling , and this process is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 .
c-Myb is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with the ability to transactivate promoters with the specific consensus sequence PyAACG/TG .
The c-myb gene product is a highly * Corresponding author .

2387 conserved 75- to 83-kDa phosphoprotein which is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and localized to the nucleus ( 4 , 5 , 18 , 19 , 23 ) .
Reduction of c-myb expression results in a block to hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation , and homozygous c-myb mutant mice demonstrate greatly impaired fetal hepatic hematopoiesis .
The c-myb gene product plays an important role in regulating lymphocyte proliferation .
c-myb mRNA levels vary during the cell cycle of normal T lymphocytes and reach a peak in S phase ( 37 , 38 ) .
Resting T cells express very low levels of c-Myb .
During T-cell activation , levels of c-myb mRNA increase manyfold ( 8 , 31 , 36-38 ) .
An-tisense experiments have demonstrated that the c-myb gene product is required for T cells to enter S phase of the cell cycle ( 12 ) .
Reduction of c-Myb levels does not interfere with T lymphocyte activation or early molecular events , but it does block the T cells in late G , of the cell cycle ( 12 ) .
The transcriptional control of c-myb expression has been examined in several studies ( 14 , 16 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 27 ) , but it is not known how e-myb expression is controlled during T-cell activation .
We have identified a region of the c-myb promoter that mediates an increase in c-myb expression during T-cell activation .
An inducible protein , CMAT ( c-myb in activated T cells ) , binds to this sequence .
The CMAT binding site shows some sequence similarities with the NFAT binding site , but we demonstrate that the CMAT binding activity is distinct from the NFAT binding activity .
The CMAT complex is present only in activated T cells .

RESULTS Identification of a site that mediates activation of the c-myb promoter during Jurkat T-cell activation .
To examine the contribution of transcriptional initiation to the increased expression of c-myb during Jurkat T-cell activation , promoter-re-porter constructs were made with the cmyh 5° flanking sequence and the luciferase gene .
We identified a region of the c-myb promoter that mediated an increase in promoter activity during Jurkat T-cell activation .
The location of this region in the c-myb promoter is illustrated in Fig .
1A .
Inclusion of a region between positions -784 and -758 resulted in a 9.2-fold increase in the promoter activity in activated Jurkat cells and only a 1.4-fold increase in the promoter activity in unactivated Jurkat cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
Further experiments were performed to characterize this regulatory element .
A specific complex is formed with the -784-to -- 758 region in EMSA with nuclear extract from activated T cells .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from unactivated and activated Jurkat or primary T cells and used in EMSA with the -784-to -- 758 region of the c-myb promoter .
Similar results were obtained with both Jurkat and primary T cells .
A single complex of retarded mobility was observed with nuclear extract from unactivated T cells ( Fig .
2A , lane 1 ) .
The same complex was observed with nuclear extract from activated T cells , but in addition , a more slowly migrating complex was also present ( Fig .
2A , lane 2 ) .
EMSA with nuclear extracts prepared from several other hematopoietic cell lines did not reveal any complex with the migration pattern of the more slowly migrating activated-T -cell complex ( data not shown ) .
We refer to this complex as CMAT .
The guanine residues at positions -779 and -778 are required for binding , as demonstrated in Fig .
2A , lanes 3 and 4 .
The mutated oligonucleotide did not compete against the CMAT complex ( Fig .
2A , lane 3 ) , and the CMAT complex was not formed when the mutated oligonucleotide was used as the probe for EMSA ( Fig .
2A , lane 4 ) .
In vitro methylation interference confirmed that the guanines at -779 and -778 were required for protein binding ( Fig .
2B ) .
In addition , methylation of the guanine residue at -782 interfered with protein binding ( Fig .
2B ) .
Formation of the constitutive complex was not affected by methylation of any of these guanine residues .
We did observe a consistent decrease in intensity of the guanine at Vou .

None of the guanines on the noncoding strand showed any decrease in intensity .
Although we have not defined the binding site for the constitutive complex , we have shown that sequences at the 3 ' end of the CMAT oligonucleotide are able to compete for INDUCIBLE REGULATOR OF cmyb EXPRESSION 2389 binding of the constitutive complex in EMSA ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether CMAT binding by EMSA correlated with the function of the CMAT site , the two guanine residues at -779 and -778 were mutated in the ec-myb promoter-re-porter construct .
It can be seen in Fig .
1B that this mutation abolished the increase in the cnyb promoter activity level during Jurkat T-cell activation .
Comparison of the CMAT and NFAT complexes .
Because the CMAT sequence showed some similarity to that of the NFAT site and the NFAT complex is also present only in activated T cells , we decided to investigate whether the same proteins were present in both complexes .
As shown in Fig .
2C , the NFAT complex migrated more slowly than the CMAT complex in EMSA ( compare lane 2 with lane 6 ) .
The CMAT complex competed weakly for binding with the NFAT complex at a 75-fold molar excess ( Fig .
2C , lane 3 ) , and the NFAT complex also demonstrated weak competition with the CMAT complex ( Fig .
2C , lane 7 ) .
At a 20-fold molar excess of self competitor , the complex disappeared completely ( Fig .
2C , lanes 4 and 8 ) .
Supershift EMSA were performed with antibodies against NFAT to determine whether the CMAT complex contained the NFAT protein .
Antibodies against both NFAT , and NFAT , produced supershifted bands with the NFAT probe and nuclear extract from activated T cells ( Fig .
3 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
No supershifted band was visible with the antibody against either NFAT , or NFAT , with the CMAT complex ( Fig .
3 , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
No supershifted complex was visible with antibodies against Fos , Jun , or Ets with the CMAT complex ( data not shown ) .
To determine the molecular mass of the CMAT protein , UV cross-linking of the EMSA complex followed by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed ( Fig .
4 ) .

Effects of antibodies on the EMSA complexes formed with the NFAT and myb CMAT probes and Jurkat nuclear extract .
Nuclear extract from unactivated Jurkat cells ( - ) was used in lanes 1 and 5 , and nuclear extract from activated Jurkat cells was used in lanes 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 .
The following antibodies were added : preimmune serum ( Ctl ) in lanes 2 and 6 , antibody against NFAT , in lanes 3 and 7 , and antibody against NFAT , in lanes 4 and 8 .
The NFAT complex , the supershifted NFAT complex , and the activated and constitutive myb CMAT complexes are labeled .
mass of 110 kDa was found for the NFAT protein .
This is in agreement with previous reports ( 29 ) .
The CMAT protein migrated more rapidly ; its estimated molecular mass was 90 kDa .
We also analyzed the constitutive complex and found a molecular mass of 60 kDa for this complex .
We conclude that the CMAT complex does not contain the same proteins as the NFAT complex does .
Appearance of CMAT binding activity over time .
To determine when CMAT binding activity first appears after PMA and ionomycin treatment of T cells , nuclear extracts were prepared at various times after T-cell activation .
An EMSA was performed with these nuclear extracts and the CMAT probe .
As shown in Fig .
5A , the CMAT complex is visible at 1.5 h after treatment of the Jurkat T cells .
The CMAT binding activity peaks at 8 h posttreatment , but the complex is still visible at 16 to 24 h. The same nuclear extracts were used in an EMSA with the NFAT probe .
Consistent with a previous report ( 35 ) , the NFAT complex appeared 15 to 30 min after the activation of Jurkat T cells .
The CMAT complex appeared approximately 75 min after the NFAT complex did .
This is consistent with the fact that the interleukin-2 gene is induced earlier than the c-myb gene during T-cell activation .
Figure 5B shows the time course of induction of c-myh mRNA in primary T cells during activation .

level of c-myb mRNA is seen at 5 h , and it peaks between 15 to 24 h. The time course of induction of c-myb mRNA in activated Jurkat cells is similar to that of primary T cells ; however , the level of c-myb mRNA is higher in unactivated Jurkat cells than in resting primary T cells .
New protein synthesis is required for the appearance of CMAT binding activity .
We investigated the requirements for CMAT binding activity in activated Jurkat cells using aniso-mycin .
Anisomycin inhibits ribosomal subunit association and blocks 98 % of protein synthesis in Jurkat cells at 100 wM in 5 min ( 35 ) .
Cells were treated with anisomycin 5 min prior to the addition of PMA and ionomycin , and nuclear extracts were prepared after 8 h. An EMSA with this nuclear extract demonstrated that CMAT binding activity was inhibited by approximately 98 % , but there was little effect on the constitutive complex ( Fig .
6 , lane 4 ) .
The effect of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and rapamycin on CMAT binding activity .
To determine whether immunosuppressive drugs have any effect on CMAT binding activity , Jurkat cells were incubated with several different concentrations of cyclosporin A and rapamycin .
At a concentration of 10 ng of cyclosporin A per ml , the CMAT complex was not visible ( Fig .
7A ) .
There was no effect on the constitutive complex .
Rapamycin at concentrations above 1 ng/ml prevented the formation of the CMAT complex .
The induction of c-myb promoter activity with activation was also abolished by cyclosporin A at 10 ng/ml and by rapamycin at 5 ng/ml ( Fig .
7B ) .
Western blot ( immunoblot ) analysis of T-cell nuclear extracts confirmed that no induction of c-myb expression occurred with treatment with anisomycin , cyclosporin A , or rapamycin at these concentrations ( data not shown ) .

Effects of inhibition of protein synthesis on CMAT complex binding activity .

Nuclear extracts were prepared after 8 h and used in an EMSA with the c-myb CMAT probe .
An in vivo footprint is located over the CMAT site in activated T cells .
We wished to determine whether the CMAT site was occupied in vivo in activated T cells .
In vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR was used to examine the region around the CMAT site in both unactivated and activated T cells .
As shown in Fig .
8 , there was no protection of guanine residues in the CMAT site in resting T cells .
The guanine residues in the Myb I and II sites were protected .
We have previously shown that these sites function as negative regulatory elements in T cells ( 14 ) .
In activated T cells , the Myb I and II sites were not protected , but the CMAT site was protected .
The three guanine residues required for binding in vitro were protected in vivo .
These findings are consistent with the results from EMSA that demonstrated that the CMAT binding complex was present only in activated T cells .
We did not find any evidence for in vivo binding of the constitutively expressed 60-kDa protein in resting T cells , although from our in vitro binding studies , we know that methylation protection is not the best technique to assess binding of the constitutive complex .
Treatment of the cells with cyclosporin A prior to activation resulted in no footprint over the CMAT site ( Fig .
8 , lane C ) ; the footprint results were very similar to those obtained with resting T cells .
These results support the contention that the in vivo footprint is due to the CMAT protein and not the constitutive protein .
In vivo footprinting has been performed with both Jurkat cells and primary T cells with similar results .
The footprints from primary T cells are shown in Fig .
8 .
DISCUSSION The e-myb gene product is required by activated T cells for entry into S phase of the cell cycle .
We wished to determine the mechanism of regulation of the c-myb gene during T-cell activation .
In transient transfection experiments into Jurkat cells , we identified a region located between positions -784 and -758 upstream of the ATG codon that mediated a 9.2-fold increase in the c-myb promoter activity level .
We were able to identify two potential CMAT sites with conserved contact bases in the murine e-myb promoter .
One is located 640 bp upstream of the ATG codon near two potential Myb binding sites , and the other is 570 bp upstream of the ATG codon .
In the chicken c-myb promoter , there is a potential CMAT site 1,200 bp upstream from the ATG codon .
Although c-Myb is induced in murine and chicken T cells , we have not investigated whether these potential CMAT sites play any role in the induction .
EMSA analysis with nuclear extract from activated T cells demonstrated that a new protein complex bound to the CMAT INDUCIBLE REGULATOR OF cmyb EXPRESSION 2391 site .
A more rapidly migrating constitutive complex was formed with nuclear extract from both unactivated and activated T cells .
Although there is a potential Ets site in this region , we have no evidence from antibody studies that either of these proteins is an Ets family member .
Further confirmation of the function of the CMAT binding complex in activated T cells was obtained by in vivo footprint analysis .
The CMAT site was occupied in activated T cells but not in resting T cells .
Resting T cells express low levels of c-Myb , and we did observe that the Myb I and II sites were occupied in resting T cells but not in activated T cells .
Our previous studies have shown that these sites function as negative regulatory regions in T cells ( 14 ) .
Although a constitutively expressed binding activity is observed in EMSA , we could find no evidence for binding to this site in resting T cells in vivo by methylation protection .
Although it is possible that the in vivo footprint observed in activated T cells represents binding of the constitutively expressed protein , we believe that it is the CMAT protein because its appearance correlates with the appearance of the CMAT EMSA complex and the same three guanine residues are required for binding in vitro .
In addition , no footprint is visible over the CMAT site if the T cells are A Cyclosporin A ( ng/m ! )

In vivo footprint analysis by ligation-mediated PCR of the c-myh CMAT and Myb sites in resting and activated primary T cells .
The coding strand is illustrated ; there are no guanine residues in the noncoding strand in this region .
The nucleotide numbers are relative to the translation start site .
N denotes in vitro-methylated DNA , V denotes in vivo-methylated DNA , and C denotes treatment of the T cells with 100 ng of cyclosporin A per ml for 15 min prior to the addition of PMA and ionomycin .
The protected guanines are marked by filled circles .
Protection of guanine is 64 % at position -798 ( the Myb I site in resting T cells ) , 58 % at position -812 ( the Myb II site in resting T cells ) , 68 % at positions -779 and -778 , 82 % at position -782 ( the CMAT site in activated T cells ) , 69 % at position -798 ( the Myb I site in cyclosporin-treated cells ) , and 61 % at position -812 ( the Myb II site in cyclosporin-treated cells ) .
treated with cyclosporin A prior to activation .
The protected guanines at -779 and -778 are required for binding of the CMAT complex and for transcriptional activity .
Although the binding sites for NFAT and CMAT show some sequence homology , we have demonstrated that the CMAT protein is distinct from the NFAT protein .
There is a difference in the protected guanines ( underlined ) in each of the binding sites : CMAT , GAAGGAAAA ; and NFAT , AGAGGAAAA .
Antibodies against either NFAT , or NFAT , did not react with the CMAT complex .
UV cross-link analysis demonstrated that the CMAT protein migrated more rapidly than the NFAT protein .
In addition , during T-cell activation the CMAT binding complex was induced slightly later than the NFAT complex was .
New protein synthesis was required for the appearance of CMAT binding activity as demonstrated by the fact that no CMAT complex was observed in cells treated with anisomycin prior to activation .
Treatment of the T cells with cyclosporin A prior to activation prevented the appearance of the CMAT complex in EMSA and the in vivo footprint over this site .
Cyclosporin treatment also abolished the induction of c-myb promoter activity .
Treatment with rapamycin had a similar effect .
Thus , inhibition of either of two different pathways involved in T-cell activation can interfere with c-myb expression .
Similar results have been reported for another nuclear oncoprotein , c-jun ( 34 ) .
On the basis of the molecular mass and the binding site of the CMAT protein , we believe that it represents a novel inducible transcription factor .
Because activated T cells require c-Myb to enter S phase of the cell cycle , identification of the factors that induce c-Myb expression is essential for an understanding of the events involved in T-cell activation .
The CMAT protein appears to be another component of the T-cell activation cascade .
Further characterization of this novel inducible transcription factor and a determination of the role it plays in T-cell activation are under way .
