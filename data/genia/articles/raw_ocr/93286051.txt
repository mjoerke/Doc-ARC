Defective Translocation of Protein Kinase C in Multidrug-resistant HL-60 Cells Confers a Reversible Loss of Phorbol Ester-induced Monocytic ( Received for publication , January 5 , 1993 , and in revised form , February 26 , 1993 ) Christopher A. Slapakt , Surender Kharbanda , Ahamed Saleem , and Donald W. Kufe From the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Previous studies have demonstrated that human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells differentiate in response to phorbol esters .
This event is associated with induction of the c-jun early response gene and appearance of a monocytic phenotype .
The present studies have examined the effects of vincristine-selected , multidrug resistance on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -induced HL-60 cell differentiation .
The results demonstrate that multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells , designated HL-60/vinc , fail to respond to TPA with an increase in c-Jun transcripts or other phenotypic characteristics of monocytic differentiation .
By contrast , treatment of HL-60/vine cells with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases , induces c-jun transcription , growth arrest , and expression of the c-fms gene .
Studies were also performed with an HL-60/vine revertant ( HL-60/vinc/R ) line that has regained partial sensitivity to vincristine .
The finding that HL-60/vine/R cells respond to TPA with induction of a monocytic phenotype , but not c-jun expression , suggests that c-jun induction is not obligatory for monocytic differentiation .
Other studies further demonstrate that the jun-B and fra-1 genes are induced by TPA in both HL-60/vine and HL-60/vine/R cells , whereas c-fos expression is attenuated in the HL-60/vinc line .
Since TPA activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , we examined translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction .
Although HL-60 and HL-60/vinc/R cells demonstrated translocation of PKC activity , this subcellular redistribution was undetectable in HL-6O0/vince cells .
Activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family with associated phosphorylation of c-Jun Y-peptide was markedly diminished in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells , but not in response to okadaic acid .
Taken together , these findings suggest that vincristine resistance confers insensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation and can include defects in PKC-mediated signaling events and induction of jun/fos early response gene expression .

cellular proliferation and differentiation ( 1 ) .
This gene codes for a major form of the AP-1 transcription factor ( 2-6 ) .
AP-1 polypeptides bind to a heptameric DNA consensus sequence TGA ( G/C ) TCA , which regulates the transcription of genes responsive to phorbol esters , growth factors , and transforming proteins ( 3 , 6-12 ) .
The c-jun gene is a member of a multigene family , which codes for leucine zipper transcription factors and includes among others the jun-B , c-fos , fos-B , and fra-1 genes .
The affinity of Jun/AP-1 for DNA binding to the phorbol ester-responsive element ( TRE ) is regulated by the formation of Jun/Jun homodimers or heterodimers with products of the fos genes ( 13-15 ) .
The product of the jun-B gene also interacts with c-Fos and the TRE ( 14 , 15 ) .
However , the finding that c-jun and jun-B differ in response to certain extracellular stimuli has suggested that these gene products play distinct roles in gene regulation ( 16 ) .
The precise role of Jun/AP-1 in growth and differentiation is unclear .
Nonetheless , recent studies have demonstrated that Jun is required for cell cycle progression into S phase ( 17 , 18 ) .
Other work has shown that ectopic expression of c-jun results in differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells ( 19 ) .
Moreover , several studies have demonstrated that c-jun expression is associated with differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells ( 20-23 ) .
For example , HL-60 promye-locytic leukemia cells differentiate along the monocytic lineage following exposure to certain agents such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) ( 24-26 ) .
The differentiated HL-60 phenotype is characterized by growth inhibition , increased adherence and an increase in monocyte cell surface antigen expression ( 24-26 ) .
In addition to induction of c-jun , jun-B and c-fos gene expression , monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells is associated with a decrease in c-myc mRNA levels and increases in tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and c-fms transcripts ( 27-29 ) .
The present work has utilized HL-60 cells selected for vincristine resistance ( 30 ) to study early response gene expression during TPA-induced differentiation .
These cells , designated HL-60/vinc , overexpress the multidrug resistance ( mdr ) gene product or P-glycoprotein ( 30 , 31 ) .
By contrast , a revertant ( HL-60/vinc/R ) which has regained partial sensitivity to vincristine expresses relatively low levels of mdr transcripts ( 30 ) .
The results demonstrate that HL-60/vine cells are unresponsive to TPA-induced monocytic differentiation , whereas the HL-60/vinc/R cell line has regained the capacity to express the differentiated phenotype .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-HL-60 , HL-60/vine , and HL-60/vinc/R cells were grown at a density of 1-2 x 10°/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin , 100 ug/ml streptomycin , and 2 mM L-glutamine .
The multidrug-resistant HL-60/vine subline was selected in increasing concentrations of vincristine ( 30 , 31 ) .
The HL-60/vinc/R revertant was obtained by prolonged passage of HL-60/vine in the absence of drug ( 30 ) .
To insure that cells were in logarithmic growth phase , cultures were seeded at 5 x 10*-1 x 10°/ml 24 h prior to treatment with 32 nM TPA ( Sigma ) , 40 ng/ml okadaic acid ( Moana Bioproducts Inc. , Hon-olulu , HI ) , or 0.5 uM calcitriol ( 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) .
Isolation and Analysis of RNA-Total cellular RNA was purified by the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride technique ( 32 ) .
The RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis through 1 % agarose-formalde-hyde gels , transferred to nitrocellulose or Gene-Screen Plus filters and hybridized to the following **P -labeled DNA probes : ( a ) the 1.8-kb BamHI/EcoRI insert of a human c-jun gene purified from a pBluescript SK ( + ) plasmid ( 3 ) ; ( b ) the 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment of the murine jun-B cDNA from the p465.20 plasmid ( 33 ) ; ( c ) the 0.9-kb Scal/Ncol insert of a human c-fos gene purified from the pe-fos-1 plasmid ( 34 ) ; ( d ) the 2-kb EcoRI insert of murine fos-B in plasmid pUC19 ( 35 ) ; ( e ) the 1.5-kb EcoRI insert of the fra-1 gene in the pSp65-fra-1 plasmid ( 36 ) ; ( f ) the 2.0-kb PstI insert of a chicken B-actin gene purified from the pA1 plasmid ( 37 ) ; ( g ) the 4.0-kb EcoRI fragment of the human c-fms gene purified from the pe-fms-102 plasmid ( 38 ) ; and ( A ) the 1.9-kb BamHI/PstI insert of a human TNF cDNA purified from the pFE4 plasmid ( 39 ) .
Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 24 h in 50 % ( v/v ) formamide , 2 x SSC , 1 x Denhardt 's solution , 0.1 % SDS , and 200 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA .
The filters were washed twice in 2 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at room temperature and then in 0.1 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 60 °C for 1 h. Flow Cytometry-Monoclonal antibody Mol ( Macl , CD11b ) was used as previously described to detect cell surface expression by flow cytometry ( 40 ) .
Results are expressed as the percentage of cells above background fluorescence determined by incubation with an isotype identical control antibody .
Nuclear Run-on Assays-Nuclei were isolated from 10° cells and suspended in 100 wl of glycerol buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCI , pH 8.3 , 40 % glycerol , 5 mM MgCl , , and 0.1 mm EDTA ) .
An equal volume of reaction buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 5 mm MgCl ; , 100 mm KCl , 1 mM ATP , 1 mm CTP , 1 mM GTP , and 5 mM dithiothreitol ) was added to the nuclei in suspension and incubated at 26 °C for 30 min with 250 LCi of [ a- '' '' P ] UTP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ; Du Pont ) .
The nuclear RNA was isolated as described ( 21 ) and hybridized to the following DNAs : ( a ) a PstI digest of the pA1 plasmid containing a fragment of the chicken S-actin gene ( 37 ) and ( b ) a BamHI/EcoRI digest of the pBluescript SK ( + ) plasmid containing a fragment of the human c-jun gene ( 3 ) .
The digested DNAs were run in 1 % agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters .
Hybridizations were performed with 10 '' cpm of P-labeled RNA/ml !
in 10 mm Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 4 x SSC , 1 mm EDTA , 0.1 % SDS , 2 x Denhardt 's solution , 40 % formamide , and 100 ug/ml yeast tRNA for 72 h at 42 °C .
The filters were washed in 2 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 37 °C for 30 min , 200 ng/ml RNase A in 2 x SSC at room temperature for 5 min , and 0.1 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 42 °C for 30 min .
Autoradiography was performed by exposure to Kodak X-Omat XAR film using an intensifying screen .
Protein Kinase C ( PKC ) Assays-Cells ( 10 ' ) were suspended in 0.4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer ( 20 mm Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 0.5 mm EDTA , 0.5 mm EGTA , 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 25 ug/ml leupeptin , and 25 ug/ml aprotinin ) .
The cells were disrupted by passage through a 25-gauge needle and then centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C .
The supernatant ( cytosolic fraction ) was applied to DEAE-cellulose for partial purification of PKC .
The pellet ( membrane fraction ) was resuspended in lysis buffer with 0.5 % Triton X-100 , sonicated for 15 s on ice , incubated on ice for 60 min , and then centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C .
The supernatant ( detergent-solubilized membrane fraction ) was used to partially purify PKC on DEAE-cellulose columns .
PKC activity was determined as described ( Ref .
41 and Protein Kinase C Assay System , GIBCO/ BRL ) .
The partially purified protein fractions were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in phospholipid ( phosphatidylserine and phorbol ester in Triton X-100 mixed micelles ; GIBCO/BRL ) , [ y-P ] JATP ( 6000 Vincristine Resistance Blocks TPA-mediated Signaling Events Ci/mmol ; Du Pont-New England Nuclear ) , and PKC synthetic pep-tide from myelin basic protein ( GIBCO/BRL ) .
The samples were dried on phosphocellulose , washed in 1 % H ; PO , , and assayed by scintillation counting .
PKC activity was determined as described in the Protein Kinase C Assay System ( GIBCO/BRL ) .
Mitogen-activated Protein ( MAP ) Kinase Assays-MAP kinase activity was assayed in HL-60 and HL-60/vine cells using cytosolic extracts as described ( 42 , 43 ) .
In brief , samples of protein-normalized cytosolic extracts ( 0.75 ml ) were loaded onto Q-Sepharose fast-flow columns ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) previously equilibrated with buffer A ( 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mm EGTA , 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 ug/ml leupeptin , 10 ug/ml aprotinin , 100 uM sodium vanadate , 0.15 M NaCl ) .
Protein was eluted with 0.6 ml of buffer A containing 0.55 M NaCl .
Aliquots ( 20 ul ) of the eluted samples were assayed for the ability to phosphorylate MBP or Y-peptide in the absence of Ca** and phospholipid after treatment of cells with TPA for 30 min or okadaic acid for 3 h ( 44 ) .
Protein concentrations of the cellular extracts were determined by the method of Bradford ( 71 ) using bovine serum albumin as a standard .
RESULTS Previous studies have demonstrated that HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells respond to TPA treatment with induction of c-jun gene expression and the appearance of a monocytic phenotype .
In the present work , we sought to determine whether similar responses occur in HL-60 cells selected for resistance to the effects of cytotoxic agents .
In order to address this issue , we have used a vincristine-selected , multidrug-resistant HL-60 subclone , designated HL-60/vine ( 30 ) .
Low but detectable levels of c-jun transcripts were present in these cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Whereas HL-60 cells respond to TPA with increases in c-jun mRNA levels ( 20 ) , there was little if any effect of this agent on c-jun expression in the HL-60/vine cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
However , exposure of HL-60/vine cells to TPA was associated with increases in jun-B mRNA that were detectable at 1 h and persisted through 24 h ( Fig .
1 ) .
This pattern was comparable with that obtained in TPA-treated parental HL-60 cells ( 27 ) .

of the jun gene family form heterodimers with fos gene products ( 13-15 ) , we similarly studied the expression of c-fos , fos-B , and the fos-related gene , fra-1 .
TPA rapidly induces c-fos , fos-B , and fra-1 transcripts ( within 1 h ) in HL-60 cells ( 28 ) .
By contrast , response of the c-fos or fos-B gene in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells was markedly attenuated compared with that in the parental line ( Fig .
1 and Ref .
20 ) .
Induction of fra-1 , however , was comparable in both the HL-60 and the HL-60/vince cells .
These findings indicated that the HL-60/ vine cells are defective in TPA-induced signaling events that regulate c-jun , c-fos , fos- B , but not jun-B or fra-1 , gene expression .
The finding that HL-60/vinc cells respond to TPA without increases in c-Jun expression suggested that other defects may exist in terms of appearance of the TPA-induced monocytic phenotype .
Indeed , whereas TPA inhibits growth of HL-60 cells , exposure of HL-60/vine cells to this agent had little if any antiproliferative effect ( Table I ) .
TPA also had no detectable effect on adherence of HL-60/vine cells ( Table I ) .
Moreover , TPA had little effect on expression of the Macl cell surface differentiation antigen ( Table I ) .
Other studies have demonstrated that TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is associated with increased expression of the TNF and c-fms genes ( 28 , 29 ) .
Northern analysis of TPA-treated HL-60/vine cells , however , failed to demonstrate changes in TNF or c-fms mRNA levels ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these results demonstrate that HL-60/vine cells are resistant to TPA-induced monocytic differentiation .
Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of HL-60 cells with calcitriol is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation through protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathways ( 45 ) .
Other work has shown that the c-jun and c-fms genes are induced in calcitriol-treated HL-60 cells ( 20 , 28 ) .
Similar findings were obtained in the present studies ( Fig .
2 ) .
By contrast , treatment of HL-60/vine cells with calcitriol had little if any effect on induction of c-jun or c-fms transcripts ( Fig .
2 ) .
Moreover , there was no evidence for the induction of phenotypic characteristics such as adherence or growth arrest .
These findings indicate that the vincristine-selected HL-60 cells are unresponsive to TPA , as well as certain other inducers of monocytic differentiation .
Recent work has demonstrated that okadaic acid , an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases ( 46 ) , is also an effective inducer of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation ( 47 , 48 ) .
Consequently , we sought to determine whether HL-60/ vine cells would respond to okadaic acid with induction of c-jun expression and monocytic differentiation .
Okadaic acid treatment of the HL-60/vince line resulted in increased c-jun mRNA levels , which were detectable at 3 h and maximal at 6 h ( Fig .
3A ) .
These findings were similar to the level of c-jun expression seen in okadaic acid-treated parental HL-60 cells ?

Total cellular RNA was hybridized to the labeled c-jun ( A ) and c-/ms ( B ) probes .
Ethidium bromide staining of the gels and hybridization to the actin probe demonstrated equal loading of the lanes .
( not shown ) .
Longer exposures to this agent were associated with a partial down-regulation of c-jun transcripts ( Fig .
3A ) .
This induction of c-jun expression by okadaic acid was also accompanied by increases in ¢c-fms transcripts .
Expression of the c-fms gene was detectable at 24 h and persisted for at least 72 h ( Fig .
3B ) .
In addition , okadaic acid treatment was associated with cessation of HL-60/vine cell growth ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that , although HL-60/vine cells are resistant to TPA-induced differentiation , this variant has retained the capacity for induction of the c-jun gene and other characteristics of the differentiated monocytic phenotype .
In order to define in greater detail the basis for these different responses to TPA and okadaic acid , we performed nuclear run-on assays to assess transcriptional control of the c-jun gene .
The actin gene ( positive control ) was constitutively active in untreated HL-60/vine cells and similar transcription rates were obtained after treatment with TPA or okadaic acid ( Fig .
4 ) .
A low level of c-jun gene transcription was present in the HL-60/vince line , and , although this gene is induced ( 2-3-fold ) in TPA-treated HL-60 cells ( 20 ) , TPA 12270 actin c-jun Control TPA OA kb Fic .

had little effect on the rate of c-jun transcription in the vincristine-resistant cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
By contrast , okadaic acid treatment was associated with an 8-fold stimulation of c-jun transcription ( Fig .
4 ) .
These findings suggest that HL-60/ vince cells are defective in TPA-induced signaling events that confer inducibility of the c-jun gene and that these events may involve serine/threonine protein phosphorylation .
The present results thus indicate that selection for vincristine resistance is associated with loss of HL-60 cells to undergo TPA-induced monocytic differentiation .
This issue was addressed in greater detail using a revertant of the HL-60/vinc line , designated HL-60/vinc/R , which has regained partial sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of vincristine ( 30 ) .
The response of HL-60/vinc/R cells to TPA was similar to that of HL-60/vince cells in that there was little effect of this agent on c-jun or fos-B mRNA levels in either line ( Fig .
5 ) .
Moreover , HL-60/vinc/R cells responded to TPA with an increase in jun-B and fra-1 mRNA which was similar to that in both HL-60 and HL-60/vine cells ( Fig .
5 and Ref .
27 ) .
By contrast , c-fos expression was increased in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc/R cells compared with the HL-60/vine line ( Fig .
5 ) .
TPA treatment of HL-60/vinc/R cells was also associated Vincristine Resistance Blocks TPA-mediated Signaling Events with inhibition of growth , adherence , and increases in Macl expression ( Table I ) .
Moreover , HL-60/vinc/R cells responded to TPA with increases in TNF and c-fms gene expression ( Fig .
6 ) .
Taken together , these results demonstrate that the HL-60/vinc/R line has regained the capacity to undergo TPA-induced monocytic differentiation .
TPA activates isozymes of the serine/threonine protein kinase C ( PKC ) family ( 49 ) .
Since the HL-60/vine and HL-60/vinc/R cells differ in their response to TPA , we compared the effects of this agent on PKC activation in these cells .
Translocation of PKC from the cytosol to membranes was measured using a synthetic PKC-specific substrate derived from myelin basic protein ( MBP ) ( 41 ) .
Using this approach , treatment of HL-60 cells with TPA was associated with a decline in cytosolic activity ( Fig .
7A ) and a concomitant increase in membrane-bound PKC activity ( Fig .
7B ) .
Although similar levels of basal PKC activity were present in HL-60/vine cells , there was no evidence of translocation during TPA treatment ( Fig .
7 ) .
However , in contrast to HL-60/vine cells , TPA treatment of the HL-60/vinc/R line was associated with translocation of PKC activity from the cytosol to the membrane fraction ( Fig .
7 ) .
Recent studies indicate that the c-Jun protein is phosphoryl-ated on serine/threonine residues by kinases of the MAP family ( 44 ) .
In this regard , phorbol ester-induced activation of c-jun in myeloid leukemia cells appears to involve MAP kinase-dependent pathways ( 44 ) .
In order to determine if defects in MAP kinase signaling pathways were present in HL-60/vine cells , we first monitored cytosolic extracts for MAP kinase activity in an assay utilizing MBP as a substrate .
After exposure to TPA for 30 min or okadaic acid for 3 h , HL-60 cells showed a marked increase in MAP kinase activity as demonstrated by more than a doubling in MBP phosphorylation .
By contrast , HL-60/vine cells had no detectable increase in MAP kinase activity in response to TPA , but did respond to okadaic acid in a manner similar to that of the parental cell line ( Fig .
8 ) .
To determine whether this difference in kinase activity resulted in increased phosphorylation of c-Jun , a synthetic Y-peptide including serine residues 57 and 62 on c-Jun was utilized as a substrate in the MAP kinase assay ( 44 ) .
HL-60 cells responded to both TPA and okadaic acid with an increase ( > 2-fold ) in phosphorylation of Y-peptide .

DISCUSSION Drug-resistant human and murine leukemia cell lines have been studied previously for their ability to differentiate in response to various inducing agents .
The results have in general demonstrated little difference in induction of a differentiated phenotype as compared with drug-sensitive parental cell lines ( 50-53 ) .
For example , multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells ( HL-60/AR ) selected in increasing concentrations of doxorubicin respond to TPA with growth inhibition and adherence ( 50 ) .
The HL-60/AR cells also differentiate in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide ( 51 ) .
Other studies in anthra-cycline-resistant murine myeloid leukemia cells have similarly demonstrated responsiveness to various inducers of differentiation ( 52 ) .
One exception , however , is a vincristine-selected murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cell line that exhibits enhanced susceptibility to hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) -induced differentiation ( 54 ) .
This increase in HMBA sensitivity has been attributed to elevated levels of PKC-8 ( 55 ) .

Effects of TPA and okadaic acid ( 04A ) on MAP kinase activity in HL-60 and HL-60/vine cells .
MAP kinase activity was determined in cytosolic fractions of cells treated with either 32 nM TPA for 30 min or 40 ng/ml okadaic acid for 3 h. MAP kinase activity was assayed using either MBP or Y-peptide as sub-strates .
The results represent the mean + S.E .
of three experiments and are expressed as a percentage of that obtained in unstimulated cells .
The absolute kinase activity values for HL-60 and HL-60/vine cells were 110 + 19 and 83 + 11 pmol/min/mg protein respectively .
In each experiment , background phosphorylation , measured in the absence of cytosolic extract , was less than 5 % .
express high levels of P-glycoprotein , whereas expression of this transporter in a partial revertant line , designated HL-60/ vinc/R , is diminished by over 95 % ( 30 ) .
Immunophenotyping studies of HL-60 , HL-60/vinc , and HL-60/vinc/R failed to detect differences in the baseline expression of myeloid or monocytic differentiation antigens ( data not shown ) .
Thus , HL-60/vine and HL-60/vinc/R appear to be at the same relatively undifferentiated state as HL-60 cells .
However , when treated with TPA , the HL-60/vinc cells fail to undergo phenotypic changes such as growth inhibition , adherence , and increases in Macl expression associated with TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells .
Treatment with calcitriol similarly failed to induce a monocytic phenotype in the HL-60/ vinc cell line .
The finding that such phenotypic changes , as well as induction of the TNF and c-fms genes , occur in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc/R cells suggested that insensitivity to differentiation by TPA in the HL-60/vinc line was reversible and related in some way to the drug-resistant phenotype .
These findings are in contrast to the conversion of differentiation inducer insensitivity to sensitivity with the development of vincristine-selected , multidrug resistance in MEL cells ( 56 ) .
Recent studies have demonstrated that TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells is associated 12272 with activation of jun/fos gene expression ( 20-23 ) .
The present findings demonstrate that HL-60/vine cells fail to respond to TPA or calcitriol with an increase in c-jun transcripts .
The findings also suggest that induction of c-jun expression is not obligatory for TPA-induced monocytic differentiation .
In this context , there was little if any increase in c-jun expression in association with TPA-induced differentiation of the HL-60/ vinc/R cells .
Moreover , the finding that jun-B and fra-1 are induced in TPA-treated HL-60/vine cells , which fail to express the mature phenotype , suggests that jun-B or fra-1 expression is not sufficient for induction of differentiation .
By contrast , although there was little induction of c-fos transcripts in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells , differentiation of the HL-60/vinc/R line with TPA was associated with increases in c-fos expression .
Jun-B functions as a negative regulator of genes activated by c-Jun ( 57 , 58 ) .
Moreover , the formation of Jun-B/c-Fos heterodimers results in more efficient binding to the TRE ( 14 , 15 ) .
Thus , coexpression of Jun-B and c-Fos might be necessary at least in part for TPA-induced differentiation in these myeloid leukemia cells .
Other studies have described HL-60 cells that are resistant to TPA-induced differentiation .
The HL-525 subline was selected in increasing concentrations of phorbol esters and fails to respond to TPA with induction of monocytic differentiation ( 59 ) .
These cells also fail to respond to TPA with induction of c-jun and c-fos expression ( 60 ) .
However , treatment of HL-525 cells with calcitriol is associated with the appearance of a monocytic phenotype in the absence of increases in c-fos transcripts ( 61 ) .
Moreover , jun-B gene expression is attenuated in TPA-treated HL-525 cells ( 62 ) .
These findings with jun-B and the sensitivity to calcitriol indicate that the signaling defects in HL-525 cells are at least in part different from those in HL-60/vine cells .
Another cell line , designated HL-60R , was similarly developed by prolonged exposure to TPA , but is unresponsive to both TPA and calcitriol ( 63 ) .
The HL-525 and HL-6O0R lines exhibit altered expression of PKC isozymes ( 60 , 62 , 63 ) , although the precise defect responsible for TPA insensitivity in these cells remains unclear .
By contrast , expression of the PKC-a « and PKC-8 genes is similar in HL-60/vine as compared with that in parental HL-60 cells .
Thus , the basis for insensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation in vincristine-resistant HL-60 cells appears to be different from that associated with sublines selected in the presence of phorbol esters .
Although certain insights regarding the role of early response gene expression in monocytic differentiation can be derived from studying the HL-60/vine and HL-60/vinc/R cells , we were interested in determining potential upstream signaling defects associated with TPA resistance .
One effect of TPA is the activation of PKC with translocation of isozymes from the cytosol to membrane fractions ( 49 ) .
Activation of this enzyme has been shown to be necessary for TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells ( 59 , 64 ) .
Moreover , PKC , as well as other protein kinases , have been shown to be important modulators of P-glycoprotein function ( 65 , 66 ) .
When examined for baseline expression , HL-60 , HL-60/vinc , and HL-60/vinc/R cells showed no significant differences in PKC activity .
However , although PKC activation was detectable in both HL-60 and HL-60/vinc/R cells , there was no evidence for translocation in the HL-60/vine line .
The present results demonstrate that defects in TPA-induced signaling in HL-60/vine cells also involve the MAP kinase family .
In this regard , TPA had little effect on phosphorylation of MBP and the c-Jun Y-peptide in HL-60/vine cells , whereas okadaic acid bypassed this defect .
Indeed , okadaic acid treatment was associated with activation of MAP Vincristine Resistance Blocks TPA-mediated Signaling Events kinase , phosphorylation of c-Jun Y-peptide and induction of monocytic differentiation in the TPA-unresponsive HL-60/ vine cells .
Taken together , these findings suggest that HL-60/vinec cells are defective in early TPA-induced signaling events such as translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane and subsequent serine/threonine phosphorylation .
By contrast , other events , such as induction of jun-B or fra-1 expression , would appear to be independent of redistributing PKC activity from the cytosol to membrane .
In this context , PKC has also been shown to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus ( 67 ) .
Although the signaling defects in HL-60/vine cells may be related to overexpression of P-glycoprotein , doxorubicin-se-lected multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells differentiate in response to TPA .
Additionally , vincristine-resistant MEL cells are insensitive to the inhibitory effects of phorbol esters on HMBA-induced differentiation .
Thus , the present findings may be related to resistance mechanisms specific to vincristine .
The available evidence indicates that vincristine and other vinca alkaloids inhibit microtubule assembly ( 68 ) .
Of interest , other studies have shown that tubulin polymerization appears to be necessary for induction of the differentiated phenotype in HL-60 cells ( 69 ) .
Additionally , microtubules have been shown to be functionally related to the intracellular transport of some proteins ( 70 ) .
Thus , cytoskeletal changes associated with vincristine resistance may contribute to loss of TPA-induced signaling events , such as translocation of PKC and downstream events that contribute to the induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype .
