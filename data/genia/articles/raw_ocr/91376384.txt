We report here that the phenotypic differentiation of monocyte cell lines induced by phorbol esters or tumour necrosis factor « ( TNF « ) is associated with expression of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-xB ) .
In parallel with such differentiation , HIV transcription , monitored using an HIV long terminal repeat reporter gene construct , is activated in such cells under the influence of enhanced NF-xB expression .
Also .
in a promanucyte cell lise shroni-cally infected with HIV , NF-xB expressions and HMIY transcription were enhanced on stimulation with phorbol ester or TNF « .
Thus , stimulation of monocyte cell lines by phor-bot esters or TNF « induces cell differentiation and activates HIV transcription .
Such a process may have fundamental implications in AIDS pathogenesis in vivo and may be important in disease progression induced by opportunistic infections directly or indirectly involving macrophages .

INTRODUCTION Monocytes provide an important cellular reservoir for HIV ( Ho et al. , 1986 ; Nabel and Baltimore , 1987 ; Meltzer et al. , 1990 ) .
The mobility of monocyte macrophages throughout the body into both organs of the reticulo-endothelial system , e.g .
lymph nodes and spleen and virtually all other organ systems , may provide an important vector for the virus thus facilitating its widespread dis semination .
Macrophages are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow under appropriate stimuli , such as cytokines e.g .
granulocyte-macrophage/colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and it is thought that such marrow stem cells may be chronically infected per se ( Donahue et al. , 1987 ; Folks et al. , 1988 ) .
In addition , monocytes and macrophages may become infected directly by CD4-receptor-mediated mechan-isms .
Terminal differentiation into the macrophage phenotype may be induced artificially in vitro using phorbol esters or by more physiological stimuli such as tumour necrosis factor ( TNFa ) .
We report , in this paper , a series of experiments in which we investigated the role of nuclear transcription factor NF-xB in this differentiation process .
In addition , we examined the role of this factor in the activation of HIV transcription in such cells induced to differentiate ( Griffin et al. , 1989 ) .
234 MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and cells were maintained ' n RPMI medium enriched with 7.5 % foetal calf serum , glutamine and supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin .
Cell lines of promonocytic phenotype HL60 and U937 ( non-adherent , absent Mol expression , non-phagocytic , non-specific-esterase-negative ) were of human origin .
Cells of mature macrophage were of phenotype THP-1 , PUS-1.8 and P388D1 .
Some experiments were carried out on promonocytic cell iine U1 , chronically infected with HIV , which expresses very low levels of HIV transcription when un-stimulated .
In some experiments , monocytes were prepared from human blood of normal volunteers by dextran sedimentation and cen-trifugation through a discontinuous Ficoll-Hypaque gradient .
Monocytes of intermediate homogeneity ( 80 % ) were prepared by one cycle of adherence onto plastic and further purification ( 95 % ) was achieved by repeated cycles of washing using KPMI mogium over a period to remove contaminating non-adherent cells .
In another series of experiments , mouse peritoneal macrophages were prepared from ascitic fluid induced by in-traperitoneal injection of mineral oil or complete Freund 's adjuvant and purified by adherence on plastic and repeated cycles of washing .
Cell transfection Cells were transfected either in suspension or adherent using the conventional DEAE-dextran technique ( Nabel and Baltimore , 1987 ) with the exception that 10 uM chloroquine was used instead of the higher concentrations of this agent originally described .
Cells G.E .
GRIFFIN ET AL .
( 10 ' ) were transfected with 10 ug of a plasmid containing the HIV enhancer linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) gene .
Control experiments were carried out in which cells were transfected with a mutant plasmid ( 10 pg ) altered in both xB-binding sites using DEAE-dextran .
Then , 24 h after transfection , cells were washed with RPMI and incubated with medium alone , or in the presence of 40 nM 12-O-tetrade-canoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) or the water-soluble phorbol-12 , 13-dibutyrate ( PDB ) at a concentration of 20 nM which is more easily removed from cells by cycles of washing .
Twenty hours after stimulation , cells were harvested and cytoplasmic ( Nabel and Baltimore , 1987 ) and nuclear extracts prepared ( Osborn er al. , 1989 ) .
Protein concentration in the extracts was measured using the Bradford method ( Biorad ) .
Chemical assays CAT was assayed by standard methods ( Nahel and RBaltimare , 1987 ) on cytoplasmic extracts .
NF-xB-binding activity was determined on nuclear extracts containing 10 ug protein using conventional electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( Leung and Nabel , 1988 ) in the presence of 1 pg dIdC .
Extracts were incubated with a xB probe alone or in the presence of a double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor containing the xB site or an unrelated interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter fragment in order to determine the specificity of binding .
RESULTS Nuclear NF-xB-binding activity NF-xB-binding activity in nuclear extracts from the cells is shown in figure 1 .
No NF-xB-binding activity was detected in the promonocytic cell lines in the unstimulated state ( fig .
1A ; HL-60 and U937 ) .
However , in these cells , stimulation with TPA resulted in phenotypic differentiation and the appearance of NF-xB-binding activity .
In contrast , constitutive NF-xB-binding activity was demonstrated in the mature cell lines ( fig .
1A ; THP-1 , PUS-1.8 and P388DI ) .
In addition , NF-xB-binding activity was detected in the unstimulated state .
Since the immature cell lines were both of human .
origin and the mature cell lines were derived from mouse cells , we therefore wished to demonstrate NF-xB-binding activity in cells harvested direcly in vivo .
NF-xB-binding activity was detected in human monocytes ( fig .
1B ) and in mouse peritoneal macrophages .
TPA stimulation of cells is known to be irreversible but TPA is lipid soluble and can not be removed from cells .
We therefore used PDB , a water-soluble phor-bol !
ester which can easily be removed from celis by washing , in an effort to see if short storm stimulation ( 2 h ) followed by washing resulted in long-term expression of NF-xB-binding activity .
PDB treatment of HL-60 and U937 cells resulted in expression of NF-xB after 2 h of treatment which was still present 48 h after the phorbol ester was washed away from cells .
HIV transcription HIV CAT Transcription of transfected HIV-CAT did not occur in immature monocytes , however on stimulation with phorbol ester , transcription was enhanced 17-fold ( fig .
2A ) .
In contrast , the mature cell lines constitutively expressed CAT = chloramphenicol acetyl transferase .
NF-xB = GM-CSF = granulocyte-macrophage/colany-stimulating factor .
PDB = IL = interleukin .
TNF = LPS = lipopolysaccharide .

HIV TRANSCRIPTION AND NF-yxB IN MONOCYTE CAT and such expression was not enhanced by phorbol ester stimulation .
No CAT activity was detected in any of the cells transfected with the plasmid containing mutant xB .
HIV production To determine whether monocyte differentiation and NF-xB induction affected production of intact virus , the latently infected U1-cell line ( Folks , 1988 ) was incubated with PDE or TNF « .
Under these conditions , phenotypic differentiation of the cells occurred as monitored using change in cell surface characteristics ( adhesion , Mol expression ) .
In addition , HIV production was enhanced in these cells as shown by increased reverse transcriptase activity and p24 detected in the incubating medium ( fig .
3 ) .
Both NF-xB activity and HIV production persisted 24-48 h after the stimulus was removed .
DISCUSSION In these experiments , we have demonstrated that NF-xB-binding activity was induced in nuclear extracts of immature cells of monocyte lineage , in response to stimulation by phorbol ester or cytokine .
Such cells assumed and retained a macrophage phenotype as a result of such stimulation .
Transient exposure to PDB ( < 2 h ) did not lead to constitute expression of NF-xB binding and had no effect on cell morphology ( data not shown ) .
Once monocyte differentiation occurred , however , NF-xB-binding activity remained , as seen constitutively expressed in normal monocytes prepared from human blood and mouse peritoneal exudate ( fig .
1 ) .
In the process of cell differentiation , we have demonstrated that the appearance of NF-xB contributes to the activation of HIV in monocytes .
This has great clinical implications in that the presence of an opportunistic infection , or HIV infection of monocyte/macrophages per se , is likely to activate HIV transcription and therefore presumably enhance disease progression .
It is known , however , that NF-xB is not the sole activa-tor of HIV in macrophages .
For example GM-CSF , which does not induce NF-xB binding , activates HIV expression in mature macrophages ( Koyanagi et al. , 1988 ) which already contain NF-xB , and therefore alternate non-NF-xB activation mechanisms are likely to exist in vivo .
Phorbol esters provide a potent reproducible stimulus in vitro for monocyte differentiation and HIV 102 3 4 @ © u-d , 235 activation ; however , such a stimulus is artificiel .
It is now becoming apparent that , in clinical HIV infection , the physiological stimuli most likely to induce HIV activation are the cytokines or some bacterial products , for example endotoxin ( LPS ) .
HIV infection of monocyte/macrophages is clearly an important cell-activating event per se and several groups have reported stimulation of cytokine transcription and release in response to this event .
For example , the production of TNFa , B and interferon has been demonstrated in inonocytes ( Vyakarnam et al. , 1990 ) .

ity to produce cytokines after LPS stimulation ( Molina et a/. , 1990 ) .
These findings were supported by a similar study using human monocyte/macrophages infected in vitro ( Munis et al. , 1990 ) .
LPS has been shown to be a potent stimulus of HIV1 expression in monocyte/macrophage cell lines , but not surprisingly LPS has no similar activity towards on lym-phocytes ( Pomerantz et a/. , 1990 ) .

Activation of HIV-CAT expression in immature monocyte cells ( A ) is elicited by exposure to 40 nM '_I ‘ PA .
In contrast constitutive CAT activity is seen in unstimulated mature cells ( B ) .
monocyte/macrophages may be acting in an autocrine manner in HIV-infected cells to promote HIV activation ( Poli et al. , 1990 ) .
Macrophages are known to be crucial cells in host defence against infection .
Many stimuli are known to activate such cells via different mechanisms and receptors .
However , a final common end point of terminal differentiation of monocyte into macrophage appears to be the constitutive expression of NF-xB , .
Ws have demonstrated that such differentiation is associated with activation of HIV transcription and virus production in these cells .
The relationship of other receptor-mediated activation processes of macrophages , for example phagocytosis , which are relevant to the in vivo situation clearly deserve investigation .

Increased constitutive expression of NF- « B ( A ) and HIV ( B and C ) in an HIV chronically infected promonocytic cell line , U1 , following cellular differentiation induced by PDB or TPA .
Reverse transcriptase ( RT ) activity and p24-antigen activity were determined in tissue culture supernatants ( B ) as indices of HIV production .
U1 cells were incubated in medium alone ( & ) or incubated with 2 nM PDB ( & ) , 20 nM PDB ( @ ) or 10° units/ml TNFa for 48 h followed by washing and incubation for a further 24 or 48 h. du VIH , set activée dans de telles celluies sous i'infiluence de l ’ augmentation de l ’ expression m da NF- @ B , De mam » , aans une `` 511W cellulaire promonocytaire infectée chroniquement par le VIH , lexpression du NF-xB et la transcription du VIH sont stimulées par les esters de phorbol ou le TNF .
