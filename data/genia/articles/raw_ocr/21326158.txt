The MAT II isozyme consists of a catalytic « 2 and a regulatory B subunit .
Down-regulation of the MAT II B subunit expression causes a 6-10-fold increase in intracellular AdoMet levels .
To understand the mechanism by which the B subunit expression is regulated , we cloned the MAT2B gene , determined its organization , characterized its 5'-flanking sequences , and elucidated the in vitro and in vivo regulation of its promoter .
Transcription of the MAT2B gene initiates at position -203 relative to the translation start site .
Promoter deletion analysis defined a minimal promoter between positions +52 and +93 base pairs , a GC-rich region .
Inclusion of the sequences between -4 and +52 enhanced promoter activity ; this was primarily because of an Spl recognition site at +9/+15 .
The inclusion of sequences up to position -115 provided full activity ; this was attributed to a TATA at -32 .
The Spl site at position +9 was key for the formation of protein-DNA complexes .
Mutation of both the Spl site at +9 and the TATA at -32 reduced promoter activity to its minimal level .
Supershift assays showed no effect of the anti-Spl antibody on complex formation , whereas the anti-Sp3 antibody had a strong effect on protein-DNA complex formation , suggesting that Sp3 is one of the main factors binding to this Spl site .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays supported the involvement of both Spl and Sp3 in complexes formed on the MAT2B promoter .
The data show that the -untranslated sequences play an important role in regulating the MAT2B gene and identifies the Spl site at +9 as a potential target for modulating MAT2B expression , a process that can have a major effect on intracellular AdoMet levels .

24918 S-adenosyltransferase ) ( EC 2.5.1.6 ) catalyzes the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet ) ( 1 , 2 ) .
AdoMet is the major methyl donor in transmethylation reactions and the propyla-mine donor in the biosynthesis of polyamines ( 3-5 ) .
Further-more , AdoMet participates as a co-factor in key metabolic pathways ( 3-5 ) .
Most species studied to date have more than one MAT isozyme ( 6 ) .
In mammals , the two major MAT isozymes are designated MAT IIII and MAT II ( 7-10 ) .
The MAT III isozymes are , respectively , a tetramer and dimer of a catalytic al subunit that is expressed only in liver ( 7 , 11-13 ) .
The MAT II isozyme is expressed in all tissues including the liver ( 9 , 14-21 ) .
Previous studies from our group ( 15 , 22 ) have determined that MAT II from human leukemic T and B cells , as well from activated human lymphocytes , is a hetero-oligomer that consists of « 2 ( 53 kDa ) , « 2 ' ( 51 kDa ) , and B ( 38 kDa ) subunits .
The « 2/B hetero-oligomeric composition of MAT II was also determined in bovine brain , Ehrlich ascites tumor , and calf thymus ( 15 , 19 ) .
The « 2 subunit is responsible for the enzyme catalytic activity and is post-translationally modified to generate a2 ' ( 15 , 22-26 ) .
Recently , Halim et al .
( 27 ) reported the characterization and regulation of the human MAT2A gene and found it to be remarkably similar to that of the rat and mouse MAT2A genes ( 28 , 29 ) as well as to the human MATIA gene ( 30 ) , which encodes the liver-specific al subunit .
In contrast to MAT a subunits , which are highly conserved throughout evolution , the subunit of MAT II seems to be only present in the mammalian species ( 15 , 19 ) .
Recently , we cloned and characterized the human MAT II 8 subunit ( 26 , 31 ) , found that it has no catalytic activity , and confirmed that it acts as a regulatory subunit for the enzyme .
When $ 3 associates with the a subunit it alters its kinetic properties and renders MAT II more susceptible to product inhibition by AdoMet ( 26 , 31 ) .
Interestingly , the human $ subunit can also interact with the al subunit of MAT IIII and the Escherichia coli « a MAT subunit and alter their kinetic properties as well ( 26 , 31 ) .
The expression of the MAT II « 2 , « 2 ' , and B subunits varies considerably in different tissues .
The « 2 , « 2 ' , and B subunits are constitutively expressed at high levels in leukemic cells and at low levels in normal resting T cells .
Stimulation of normal human lymphocytes results in marked changes in the level of expression of these subunits .
Nonphysiological polyclonal mitogenic stimulation of human T cells induces an increased expression of the « 2/a2 ' subunits but not the B subunits ( 22 , 25 ) .
By contrast , physiological stimulation of T cells by bacterial superantigens induces an up-regulation of the « 2/a2 ' subunits and a down-regulation of the B subunit ( 25 ) .
This results in the formation of « 2 and « 2 ' homo- and/or hetero-oligomers ( no B ) with a 3-fold higher K , , , for L-Met .
The form of MAT II without B is resistant to product inhibition by AdoMet when compared with the form of MAT II found in resting or leukemic This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; The Human MAT2B Gene and Its Promoter TaBLE I Sequence of primers used for MAT2B promoter constructs Name Primer ( 5'-3 ' ) Position 5'WP ACTCGAGCTGCTTAGTCTTTAGTTT -998 3'WP GAAGCTTGCCCGCCGTCTTCAC +204 5'BP1 ACTCGAGTGCCAGGGTTTACTTTCT -826 5'BP2 GCTCGAGTGGGCTTGATTCTGGTTA -596 5'BP3 TCTCGAGTTCATCTTCCTTCCCCTAC -484 5'BPA4 ACTCGAGACGCCAACCCTTTTAT -363 5'BP5 TCTCGAGCTTTTTATTCCACTTTTTAT -287 5'BP6 ACTCGAGAAACTCAAGGCGATCCACTT -174 3'BP6 TCTGCCCCCAGCCCAG -2 5'BP ? 7 ACTCGAGAATAAAAAGCACTCAAATAAAATCTCC -115 5'BP8 CCTCGAGACCGCGCGTACC -4 3'BP8 GTTGATTGGCCACGCTCC +51 5'BP9 ACTCGAGGGCGCGGCTATGGCAG +52 5'BP10 TCTCGAGTCGTTCTGGGCCTAGGG +98 5'BP11 ACTCGAGGGTTGGAGGAGGTGGCG +154 T cells ( includes $ ) ( 25 ) .
Importantly , the down-regulation of the subunit in physiologically stimulated T cells was accompanied by a 6-10-fold increase in intracellular AdoMet levels , presumably caused by the loss of product inhibition of the enzyme ( 25 ) .
An increase in AdoMet levels is likely to stimulate certain transmethylation reactions catalyzed by methyltrans-ferases with a relatively high K , , , value for AdoMet .
Based on our previous results , we hypothesized that the down-regulation of the MAT II 3 subunit may be an important event in the physiological stimulation of T cells , and we sought to characterize the regulation of expression of the MAT2B gene .
Here we report the chromosomal localization and organization of the MAT2B gene and provide a detailed characterization of the structure and function of its promoter .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and Genomic Organization of the MAT2B Gene-Based on the sequence of the previously reported MAT II subunit cDNA ( 31 ) , forward and reverse primers spanning the entire open reading frame were designed and used to amplify genomic DNA isolated from normal human lymphocytes .
Reactions yielding larger than expected products suggested the presence of introns , and these PCR products were cloned and sequenced to verify the authenticity of introns .
Sequences at the intron-exon boundaries of the MAT2B gene were determined by aligning the cDNA sequence of MAT2B cDNA with the genomic sequence .
A set of primers , GSF ( 5'-GATTCCTGAGTCCTGTCTTAG ) and GSR ( 5'-GCACTTTTGGCTTTCACTCAG ) , that amplified a 79-bp product that included the 3 ' end of intron 4 and the 5 end of exon 5 were used to screen a human P1 genomic library ( Genome Systems , Inc. , St. Louis , MO ) .
Positive clones were partially sequenced to ascertain the presence of the MAT2B gene .
Clone 22646 was selected for further characterization and used to determine the chromosomal location of the MAT2B gene , determine gene organization , verify intron positions , and characterize MAT2B promoter function .
Chromosomal Localization of the Human MAT2B Subunit Gene-Highly purified DNA was obtained from the MAT2B PL genomic clone 22646 using the Wizard PureFection DNA purification system ( Pro-mega , Madison , WI ) .
The DNA was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50 % formamide , 10 % dextran sulfate , and 2X SSC .
Specific hybridization signals were detected by using fluorescein-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibodies .
The chromosomes were counterstained with propidium io-dide and analyzed .
Mapping the MAT2B Gene Transcription Start Site-Identification of the transcription start site was done by primer extension analysis using poly ( A ) * RNA prepared from normal human lymphocytes .
The primer extension reaction was conducted using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase primer extension system ( Promega ) .
Poly ( A ) * RNA was isolated from 500 ml of human blood by the Poly ( A ) Tract mRNA isolation system ( Promega ) .
Two primers , Bral 5'-GTTCTT-TCTCCCTCCCCACCAT-3 ' ( complementary to positions +22-+1 of the open reading frame ) and Bra2 5-CAGTTCTTTCTCCCTCCCCACC-3 ' ( complementary to positions +24-+3 of the open reading frame ) , were Human Lymphocyte MAT2B Gene Exon : 1 2 34 5 6 7 a 10 A4 r x e non qi A poy { *A ~ 2 '' moa dab \ a % *X *~ 4* 450 a bon ob A\ As ~~ , + 550 ad an Ga o C Cp `` ay £ F4 y__1 N c & [ _ zos [ és ] iso [ us| iss | is4 |1n4 ] | 171 | sor ﬂ ATG TAG Exons and Introns Exon Intron 5 ; Amino Acid Number Size ( bp ) Number - ~Size ( bp ) lnlerrupiéd Type 1 5NC ( 205 ) + 63 I 619 Glw/Glu22 0 2 189 II 1068 Gin/Pro8S 0 3 115 H 155 Alal23 I 4 153 IV 1730 Gly174 I 5 194 v 753 Lew/Asp239 0 6 114 VI 437 Pro/Mle277 0 7 171 + 3NC ( 802 ) Sequence at Exon/Intron Junction 5 ' Donor Exon Intron 3 ' Acceptor Exon TGGTGGAG gtgaggga -- -ccttttag GAGGAAGT ATTTTCAG gtattgat -- -acttctag CCCCATGT GCAAGCAG gtaatgat -- -ttttgtag CcTectert CAATCTAG gtaagace -- -ttctctag GAGCTGCT GAATGCTG gtaagaag -- -gttcttag GATCCATC TAAGACCT gtaagtac -- -ctttaaag ATTACTGA Fig .

Cloning of the Human MAT2B Gene Promoter-We cloned and sequenced 3.5 kbp of the -flanking DNA of the human MAT2B gene .
The promoter was contained within 1.1 kbp .
The primers 5-WP ( 5'-GCTC-GAGTAAGATGATCTTGGC ) and 3'-WP ( 5-GAAGCTTGCCCGC-CGTCTTCAC ) were designed to amplify the region -998/+204 with respect to the transcription start site .
The primers introduced an XhoI site at the 5 ' end and a HindIII site at the 3 '' end of the cloned promoter .
The Pfu-amplified fragment was cloned into the pGEM-TEasy vector ( Promega ) , and the cloned MAT2B promoter was sequenced in both directions with overlapping segments to verify the sequence and confirm the integrity of the cloned promoter .
The cloned promoter DNA was excised from the pGEM-TEasy vector by digestion with and HindIII ( Promega ) , purified , and processed as described below .

Directional insertion was verified by restriction digestion and by sequencing the clone from both directions .
Subsequent deletion constructs were generated by PCR using sequence-specific primers ( Table I ) containing the restriction sites XhoUHindIII as described above .
The purified PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-TEasy vector ( Promega ) and sequenced for ver-ification .

Two primers starting at MAT2B cDNA sequence +22 ( Bral ) and +24 ( Bra2 ) with respect to the translation initiation site were annealed to human lymphocyte poly ( A ) * RNA and extended in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase .
Extension products of 225 and 227 bases in length were observed , indicating that transcription starts 203 bases upstream of the translation start site .
An M18mp18 sequencing reaction was used as a size marker .
The Human MAT2B Gene and Its Promoter labeled primers .
The amplified DNA representing specific regions of the proximal promoter of the MAT2B gene was generated using the primers listed in Table I. Jurkat cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 27 ) .
The binding reactions were performed in a 20-ul final volume by incubating 60 fmol ( ~50,000 epm ) of `` °P-labeled probe with 5 ug of crude nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells in the presence of 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , 1 ug of salmon sperm DNA in 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mm MgCl , , 0.1 mm EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 10 % glycerol , and 6 ug of bovine serum albumin for 40 min on ice .
The reactions were conducted in the absence or presence of specific or nonspecific competitors , both added at a 100-fold molar excess .
Specific competitors were cold probes ; nonspecific competitors were unlabeled PCR amplification products of an unrelated DNA sequence , free of sites of interest , and similar in size to specific competitor .

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Cross-linking between transcription factors and chromatin was achieved in Jurkat cells by following the method described by Yang et al .
( 82 ) .
Briefly , formaldehyde was added to cells at a final concentration of 1 % for 10 min , and 0.125 M glycine was used to stop the reaction .
The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and once with PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then lysed in 2 ml of cell lysis buffer ( 5 mM Pipes-KOH , pH 8.0 , 85 mM KCl , and 0.5 % ( v/v ) Nonidet P-40 ) in the presence of protease inhibitors ( 100 ng/ml leupeptin , 100 ng/m !
aprotinin , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
The lysates were homogenized , and the nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 250 x g for 10 min and resus-pended in 0.2 ml of nuclear lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , 10 mM EDTA , 1 % ( w/v ) SDS plus the protease inhibitors .
The lysate was sonicated to shear the chromatin to an average length of < 2 kb .
The samples were diluted 10-fold with the immunoprecipitation dilution buffer ( 1 % ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , 16.7 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , 1.2 mM EDTA , and 167 mM NaCl plus the protease inhibitors ) .
A 240-ul slurry of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose ( Upstate Biotechnology , Inc. , Lake Placid , NY ) was added to reduce nonspecific binding , and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4°C then centrifuged at 500 % g for 1 min .
Precleared chromatin solutions were incubated with antibody to Spl ( 10 pg ) , Sp3 ( 10 ug ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. ) or no antibody ( negative control ) and rotated at 4 °C for 12 h. Immune complexes were collected by adding 80 pul of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 4 h with rotation .
Samples were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer ( 0.1 % ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , 20 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , and 2 mM EDTA ) , and the immunoprecipitated material was eluted by three successive 5-min incubations with 150 ul of elution buffer ( 1 % ( w/v ) SDS and 50 mM NaHCO , ) .
To reverse the formalde-hyde-induced cross-linking , the eluates were pooled , NaCl was added at a final concentration of 0.3 M , and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h. This step was followed by digestion in 10 ul of 2 M Tris , pH 6.8 , 10 pul of 0.5 M EDTA , and 2 ul of proteinase K ( 20 mg/ml ) .
The samples were incubated for 2 h at 45 °C , and then the DNA was extracted with 24921 phenol/CHC ] , followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 50 ul of sterile H , O .
Five pl of DNA solution were used as a template in PCR analysis .
Primers were designed to amplify the regions from -174 or -4 to + 52 .
The primer 5'-BP8 ( 5-ACTCGAGAAACTCAAGGC-GATCCACTT ) or 5'-BP9 ( 5-CCTCGAGACCGCGCGTACC ) was paired with primer 3'-BP8 ( 5'-TCTGCCCCCAGCCCACG ) .
The PCR products were separated on 1.5 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
In Vivo and in Vitro Analysis of the Effect of MAT2B Promoter Mut-ations-Several mutations were introduced into the clones pGL3-MA-T2B ( -174 ) -LUC , pGL3-MAT2B ( -115 ) -LUC , and pGL3-MAT2B ( -4 ) -LUC according to a modification of the method of Wang and Wilkinson ( 33 ) that targets putative factor recognition sites .
Mutation of the TBF site at -111/-105 was generated using the primers 5'-MU1 ( 5'-GCT-CGAGAATAACAAGCACTCAAATAAAATCTCC ) and 3'-MU1 ( 5'-GAG-ATTTTATTTGAGTGCTTGTTATTCTCGAGCC ) .
Another possible TBF site at -95/-91 was mutated using the primers 5'-MU2 ( 5'-GCACTC-AAATACCATCTCCGAAACAAAACCTG ) and 3'-MU2 ( 5'-CAGGTTTT-GTTTCGGAGATGGTATTTGAGTGC ) .
The TATA box at -382/-28 was mutated with oligos 5'-MU3 ( 5'-CTTTTGTGTGTCGCTTTTTGCATCG-GCGCGTG ) and 3'-MUS3 ( 5'-CACGCGCCGATGCAAAAAGCGACACA-CAAAAG ) .
Mutation of the Spl site at position +9/+15 was generated with the primers 5'-MU2 ( 5'-CAGACCGCGCGTACCTTACCTCTTTC-TGG ) and 3'-MU2 ( 5'-CCAGAAAGAGGTAAGGTACGCGCGGTCTG ) .
The second Spl site at +23/+28 was mutated using the primers 5'-MUS ( 5'-CCTCTTTCTGGGTTTTCGGCGGAGCGTGGC ) and 3'-MUS5 ( 5'-GCCACGCTCCGCCGAAAACCCAGAAAGAGG ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on promoter constructs by PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) and the oligos listed above following the method of Wang and Wilkinson ( 83 ) .
Briefly , after the PCR reaction the product was incubated at 37 °C with Dpnl ( Promega ) to remove the methylated template DNA .
A portion of the digested reaction mix was analyzed on a 1 % agarose gel to verify the PCR product size .
E. coli strain JM109 was transformed using 5 ul of the PCR-amplified vector , and six clones of each transformation were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired muta-tions .
The mutated DNA products were excised from the pGL8 vector using XAhol and HindIII and individually recloned into an unamplified pGLS8-Enhancer vector ( Promega ) to ensure that the vector itself was not modified during the mutagenesis reaction .
The in vitro and in vivo activity of each mutant construct was determined as described above .
EMSA probes -115/-4 and -4/+52 were generated by using the mutated pGL8-MAT2B ( 115 ) -LUC clones as templates and external primers 3'-BP8 ( 5'-TCTGCCCCCAGCCCACG ) and 3'-BP9 ( 5'-GTTGATTG-GCCACGCTCC ) .
Results from only those mutations that affected promoter activity are described below .
RESULTS Genomic Organization of the MAT2B Gene-Human genomic clone 22646 was determined to harbor the MAT2B gene and a significant portion of its 5'-flanking sequence .
A series of primers were designed , based on the known MAT2B cDNA sequence , to determine the structure of the MAT2B gene .
The gene consisted of seven exons interrupted by six introns spanning ~6.8 kbp of genomic DNA ( Fig .
1 ) .
The sizes and locations of the various exons and introns as well as the donor and acceptor sequence are summarized in the # set table .
All boundaries were found to conform to the GT-AG rule ( 34 ) .
Exon 1 contained 203 bp of 5'-noncoding region and 63 bp of coding sequence .
Exon 7 contained 171 bp of coding sequence and 802 bp of -untranslated sequence .
Chromosomal Localization of the Human MAT2B Subunit Gene-A total of 80 metaphase cells was analyzed as detailed under `` Materials and Methods '' ; 69 of those exhibited specific labeling with DNA from clone 22646 on chromosome 5 .
An anonymous genomic probe , previously mapped to 5q22 and confirmed by cohybridization with a probe from the cri du chat locus , hybridized to the same chromosome as clone 22646 , confirming the location as the long arm of chromosome 5 .
Ten individual measurements of specifically labeled chromosome 5 demonstrated that the 22646 clone hybridized to a position 89 % of the distance from the centromere to the telomere of 5q , an area that corresponded to the interface between bands 5q34 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24922 The Human MAT2B Gene and Its Promoter A B 1 2 3 4 5 6 _ 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 `` 3 wo wa .

''
The primer Bra2 yielded a 227-bp product , and Bral yielded a 225-bp product ( Fig .
2 ) .
Therefore , transcription was shown to start 203 bp upstream of the MAT2B translation start site .
Cloning and Sequencing of the Human MAT2B Gene Promot-er-The sequence of ~1.1 kbp of the 5'-flanking region of the MAT2B gene is shown in Fig .
3 .
The sequence from -15 to + 203 in the 5'-flanking region is high in GC content with clusters of overlapping Spl sites ( Fig .
3 ) .
A TATA box is located 32 bp upstream from the transcription start site .
In Vivo Analysis of the MAT2B Promoter Activity-A series of promoter deletion constructs coupled to a firefly luciferase reporter gene in a pGL3-Enhancer vector were generated as described under `` Materials and Methods '' and used to analyze functional expression in Cos-1 and Jurkat human leukemic T cells .
There was little difference in the pattern of expression of the pGL3-MAT2B promoter constructs in both types of cells ( data not shown ) .
Successive deletions from -998 to -115 of the MAT2B promoter had little effect on promoter activity ; however , further deletions resulted in a gradual decrease of promoter activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
Little to no promoter activity was seen when only the region from +93 to +204 was included in the construct .
The region from +52 to +93 provided minimal promoter activity , and the inclusion of sequences between -4 and +52 significantly increased activity .
This indicated that the 5'-noncoding sequences of MAT2B are contributing to promoter function .
Another significant enhancement in promoter activity was seen when sequences between positions -115 and -4 were also included .
Functional studies described below indicated that this enhancement was conferred by the inclusion of a TATA sequence at position -32/-8 .
No further enhancement was observed when additional upstream sequences were included .
Together the data indicate that the sequences between +52 and +93 provide minimal promoter activity , whereas sequences between -115 and +93 provide the full promoter activity .
Identification of Functional Sites in the MAT2B Promoter Activity by EMSA and Supershift Assays-Analysis of the proximal MAT2B promoter sequence identified several putative recognition sites for known transcription factors .
These regions were subjected to further functional analysis using EMSA , supershift assays , and mutation of specific sites .
Competition experiments showed that the complexes that formed on a probe representing the region from -115 to -4 were nonspecific ( Fig .
5B ) .
By contrast , strong and specific complexes were formed on a probe representing the region from -4 to +52 ( Fig .
5C ) .
Strong complexes were also formed on the region from +52 to +93 , which is GC-rich .
These complexes were partially competed off with the nonradioactive probe covering the same sequence ( Fig .
5D ) .
The region from -4 to +93 has several Spl and NFL sites ; however , neither the Spl nor the NFL antibodies caused supershift of the complexes .
Although the anti-Sp2 antibody induced a slight supershift , the anti-Sp3 antibody had the strongest effect , causing the complete disappearance of complex II ( Fig .
6 , A and B ) .
The data suggest that Sp3 is one of the main factors involved in complex formation in this region ; other members of the Spl family may also be involved in protein-DNA interaction on this region of the MAT2B promoter .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that both the anti-Spl and anti-Sp3 antibodies were independently able to pull down the MAT2B promoter , because PCR products were obtained in reactions with primers covering the regions from -174 to -4 and -4 to +52 ( Fig .
6C ) .
Thus , even though Sp3 seems to be a major factor that binds to the proximal MAT2B promoter , the 24923 TATA TSSq Sp !

Effect of mutating specific factor recognition sites on MAT2B promoter on in vivo activity .
The position of each mutation is indicated in the line diagram .
The reporter pGL8-MAT2B ( -115 ) -Lue or constructs with and without TATA and/or Spl mutations were transfected into Cos-1 cells and assayed for luciferase activity as described in the Fig .
4 legend .
The activity of the indicated wild-type ( WT ) or mutated ( Mx ) constructs is expressed as a percentage of respective wild-type construct activity .
The data are from at least three experiments performed in triplicate .
binding of Spl to this site im vivo can not be ruled out .
Effect of Mutating Specific Sites in the MAT2B Promoter on the in Vitro Promoter Activity-Several mutations were also made to probes covering the region from -115 to +93 .
Mutation of the Spl site at position +9 completely abolished protein-DNA complex formation on probes representing sequences from -115 to +52 or from -4 to +52 ( Fig .
7 ) .
By contrast mutation of other Spl sites in the region from -115 to +52 had no effect on complex formation .
Similarly , mutation of the three TBF sites located between -115 and -4 had no effect on complex formation .
Together the data suggest that the Spl site at +9 is key for protein-DNA interaction on this region of the promoter .
The sequence from +52 to +93 is too heavily GC-rich to mutate in a meaningful way .
Effect of Mutating Specific Sites in the MAT2B Promoter on the in Vivo Promoter Activity-The effect of mutating several putative factor recognition sites located in the region between -115 and +52 on the in vivo activity of the MAT2B promoter was tested ; however , only two mutations affected promoter activity ( Fig .
8 ) .
The TATA at -32 and the Spl site at +9 were individually or simultaneously mutated on the pGL3-MAT2B ( -115 ) -Lue or pGL3-MAT2B ( -4 ) -Lue reporter construct .
Mutation of the Spl site at position +9 reduced promoter activity by 35-50 % , whereas mutation of the other Spl sites located in the region from -115 to +52 had no effect on activity .
Mutation of the TATA at -32 reduced in vivo activity of the MAT2B promoter by only 25 % .
However , when both the TATA at -382 and the Spl site at +9 were mutated simultaneously , promoter activity was reduced by almost 60 % , reach 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24924 ing a level that is comparable with that driven by the GC-rich sequence from +52 to +93 .
Together the data indicate that GC-rich sequences in the region from +52 to +93 can drive MAT2B gene expression up to 25-30 % of it full activity , whereas the presence of the Spl site at +9/+15 and the TATA sequence at -32/-28 are required for 100 % activity .
DISCUSSION The MAT II isozyme is expressed in all tissues in which it is found as an oligomer that comprises catalytic « 2 ( 53 kDa ) and a2 ' ( 51 kDa ) subunits complexed with the B regulatory subunit ( 38 kDa ) ( 15 , 22 , 31 ) .
The B subunit lowers the K , , , value of the enzyme for 1-Met and confers susceptibility to product inhibition by AdoMet ( 26 , 31 ) .
Interestingly , we have not been able to detect the B protein in E. coli or yeast extracts ( 26 , 35 ) despite the presence of a high level of homology between this protein and enzymes that catalyze the reduction of thiamine diphos-phate-linked sugars in bacteria ( 36 ) .
Therefore , the unique role and significance of the protein in mammalian cells represents an intriguing area of study , particularly because $ is differen-tially expressed in normal and leukemic T cells and subsequently affects AdoMet levels .
In leukemic T cells , both the « 2 and subunits of MAT II are constitutively expressed at a high level .
Nonphysiological polyclonal mitogenic stimulation of primary human lymphocytes induces an increased expression of MAT II « 2 subunit only , whereas physiological stimulation via the T cell receptor results in a down-regulation of the B subunit ( 25 ) .
This is accompanied by a 6-10-fold increase in AdoMet levels ( 25 ) .
Thus the pattern of expression of the MAT2B gene may be an important mechanism for regulating intracellular levels of AdoMet .
To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the differences in MAT II 6 subunit expression in different cells , we cloned and characterized the MAT2B gene and its 5'-flanking sequence .
Promoter activity was very similar in Cos-1 cells and Jurkat human leukemic cells .
This is consistent with our previous observations that the B subunit is constitutively expressed in both cell types ( 37 ) .
Minimal promoter activity is contained between position +52 and +93 , which is rich in GC content .
However , full promoter activity was achieved when sequences from -115 to +52 were included .
The Spl site located within the 5'-noncoding region of the gene ( +9/+15 ) seems to play a key role in this enhancement inasmuch as mutation of this site abolished DNA-protein interactions and significantly reduced promoter activity in vivo .
It is possible that the GC-rich region of the proximal promoter drives the residual activity when this Spl site is mutated .
Further enhancement of MAT2B promoter activity is conferred by the TATA at -32/-28 .
When the Spl at +9 and the TATA at -32 are mutated simultaneously , promoter activity is reduced by 60-70 % .
The transcription factor Sp3 seems to bind to the Sp1 site at +9/+15 , although we can not rule out that Spl and Sp2 are also part of the complexes that form on this site .
That Sp3 is involved in regulating MAT2B promoter activity is particularly interesting in light of our recent studies that showed that this transcription factor plays a key role in regulating the MAT2A gene , which encodes the catalytic subunit of the same enzyme .
As mentioned above , stimulation of T cells with a physiological stimulus induces the expression of « 2 and down-regulates the expression of the B subunit , whereas in leukemic T cells both subunits are expressed at a high level ( 22 , 37 ) .
Sp3 is a bifunc-tional protein that can both activate and repress the transcription of genes ( 38 , 39 ) .
Internal isoforms of this protein containing activation and/or repressor domains have been described ( 40 ) .
It is conceivable that Sp3 may enhance MAT2A and The Human MAT2B Gene and Its Promoter MAT2B gene expression in leukemic T cells while enhancing MAT2A and suppressing MAT2B in normal T cells .
Studies of the role of the Spl family of transcription factors in regulating MAT II « 2 and B subunit expression in normal and leukemic T cells are ongoing in our laboratory .
The identification of an Spl site on the promoter for both subunits that is key for driving promoter activity puts us closer to our goal to elucidate the differential regulation of MAT II subunits in normal and leukemic T cells .
Achieving this goal will allow us to design targeted therapeutic strategies for potentiating intracellular AdoMet levels that may lead to the control of malignant growth .
