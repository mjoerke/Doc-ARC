7 Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen 2 and Latent Membrane Protein Independently Transactivate p53 through Induction of NF- « kB Activity WEIPING CHEN anp NEIL R. COOPER* Department of Immunology , Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , California Received 22 December 1995/Accepted 3 April 1996 B-cell immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is dependent on permanent control of the cellular processes which normally regulate cell division and apoptosis , functions possessed by p53 in a number of normal cell types .
In studies initiated to evaluate relationships between EBV latent genes and p53 , p53 levels were found to increase approximately 10-fold 4 to 5 days after EBV infection of purified resting human B cells ; the induced p53 was transcriptionally active .
Latent membrane protein 1 and , to a lesser extent , EBV nuclear antigen 2 mediated the increase in p53 levels via activation of the NF-B transcription factor .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , a ubiquitous human herpesvirus , is closely associated with a number of lymphoid and epithelial malignancies , including endemic Burkitt 's lymphoma , a number of T-cell lymphomas , several subtypes of Hodgkin 's dis-ease , undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and certain other carcinomas ( 11 , 27 , 40 , 51 ) .
Particularly striking is the frequent presence of the EBV genome in the lymphomas that occur in immunocompromised individuals , including AIDS patients and transplant recipients ( 6 , 21 , 25 , 56 ) .
More than half of all human malignancies , regardless of the cell of origin , exhibit mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene .
Among EBV-associated tumors , p53 mutations are frequent in Burkitt 's lymphoma ( 12 , 14 , 61 ) , moderately common in AIDS-associated lymphomas ( 5 , 36 , 45 ) and Hodgkin 's disease Reed Sternberg cells ( 57 ) , and infrequent in nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( 9 , 52 ) and posttransplant lymphomas ( 8 ) .
Although the functions of p53 and the mechanisms of its actions are not fully understood , numerous studies have shown that wild-type ( wt ) p53 regulates cell cycle progression , prevents unrestricted cell division , and induces apoptosis in some cell types with damaged DNA ( 29 , 39 ) .
Such functions would prevent unregulated or abnormal cell growth and retard the development of tumors .
EBV infection of normal B lymphocytes in vitro generates latently infected immortal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) ; this process requires the virus to permanently control the cellular processes which regulate cell division and apoptosis , functions which are p53 dependent in a number of normal cell types .
The present studies were initiated to evaluate the relationships between EBV genes and p53 during the earliest stages of EBV infection and transformation of human B cells .
EBV infection of resting B cells increases cellular levels of transcriptionally active p53 .
We found low levels of p53 in dense resting ( nonactivated ) human B cells purified from tonsils ( 32 ) and higher levels in both short- and long-term LCL established by in vitro infection with EBV ( data not shown ) , findings which are consistent with other reports ( 4 , 53 ) .
Exons 5 to 8 of four such LCL were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced ( AmpliTag cycle sequencing kit ; Perkin-Elmer Ce- * Corresponding author .

4849 tus ) , using primers lying just outside the exon boundaries , and were found to be wt ( data not shown ) , a result that was anticipated from earlier studies ( 12 ) .
These data suggested that EBV infection increases p53 levels .
In order to evaluate this possibility and determine the time course of p53 induction , we incubated purified EBV strain B95-8 ( 37 ) with purified resting human tonsil B cells and periodically took samples for assessment of p53 expression by the Western blotting technique .
For the latter , DO-1 monoclonal antibody ( Oncogene Science ) was used , and detection was carried out with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin G ( Kirkegaard and Perry Labo-ratories , Inc. ) by using the ECL system ( Amersham . )
As is evident from Fig .
1A , EBV infection of resting B cells increased p53 levels beginning at approximately 24 h after infection , a time which antedates EBV-induced cellular DNA synthesis by at least 24 h ( references 2 and 42 , and data not shown ) .
Peak p53 levels ( approximately 10-fold greater than those of resting B cells ) occurred 4 to 5 days after EBV infection in a number of experiments of this type .
After this time , p53 levels declined slightly and then remained unchanged for at least 5 months , and probably indefinitely , since the levels at this time point were comparable to those in the LCL preparations which have been examined .
Uninfected resting B cells incubated for 6 days showed no changes in p53 levels ( data not shown ) , despite the slow progressive death of the cells ( approximately 50 % cell death by 6 days ) , confirming that the increase in p53 levels is EBV specific .
While these studies were in progress , two other groups reported that p53 levels increase to peak levels several days after primary EBV infection ( 4 , 53 ) , data which are comparable to the present results .
One of these studies reported that elevated p53 levels were maintained ( 4 ) , which is in agreement with our results , while the other found that p53 levels progressively declined and became undetectable in LCL 4 months after infection ( 53 ) ; the reasons for these differences are not apparent .
Several DNA tumor viruses , including simian virus 40 , adenovirus type 5 , and human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 , encode proteins which bind to , dysregulate , and/or inactivate p53 ( 30 , 31 , 46 , 48 , 60 , 65 ) .
EBV , like these viruses , overcomes normal cellular regulatory mechanisms , some of which are p53 dependent , leading to immortal growth and the prevention of normal cell death .
With regard to p53 and EBV , it has also been reported that EBV nuclear antigen LP ( EBNA-LP ) , a latent EBV gene product ( 54 ) , and the protein encoded by the 4850 NOTES A Days after infection aji 0 1 B _ Days after infection 2 3 4 5 6 12 20 £4 ” th vm woe mes foes nll < - 153 o 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 @ Sieg .

EBV infection of purified resting human B cells increases cellular levels of transcriptionally active p53 and is dependent on viral gene expression .
( A ) Total cellular extracts from 5 X 10° cells were prepared at various times after infection with EBV strain B95-8 and assessed for p53 protein by the Western blotting procedure with the DO-1 p53 monoclonal antibody .
( B ) Western blotting studies of mdm-2 expression at various times after infection , using a monoclonal antibody directed against mdm-2 .

m * BZLF-1 gene , a lytic-cycle protein , bind pS3 ( 66 ) , but these studies have not been confirmed and the functional consequences of such interactions have not been examined .
In the present studies , we assessed expression of mdm-2 and p21/ WAFL , two cellular genes which are transcriptionally activated by wt p53 ( 10 , 63 ) , during the early stages of EBV infection of resting human B cells .
As shown in the Western blotting study with mdm-2 monoclonal antibody ( Oncogene Science ) depicted in Fig .
1B , mdm-2 , which was undetectable in purified resting human B cells , increased with the same time course as p53 after EBV infection .
The other p53-induced gene , p21/ WAF1 , behaved similarly ; p21/WAF1 mRNA levels , which were very low in resting B cells , as determined by reverse transcription-PCR followed by densitometry , increased 68-fold ( adjusted for a modest increase in rpL32 mRNA levels ) 5 days after EBV infection ( data not shown ) .
These findings indicate that the p53 induced by EBV is transcriptionally active .
More importantly , they show that the earliest stages of EBV infection and transformation of resting B cells are not dependent on J. ViroL .
p53 inactivation by an EBV latent gene product or a cellular protein expressed during infection ; similar conclusions have recently been reached by other investigators ( 4 , 53 ) .
The EBV-induced increase in p53 levels in resting B cells is dependent on viral gene expression .
Binding of ligands to the CD21 EBV receptor on the cell surface triggers intracellular signaling pathways which modulate B-cell activation ( 13 , 38 ) .
In order to determine whether the increased p53 levels observed after EBV infection of resting B cells reflected CD21-initiated signal transduction events or instead were dependent on viral gene expression , purified resting B cells were incubated with EBV strain P3HR1 ( 37 ) ; this EBV strain , although lacking the ability to transform B cells ( 19 ) ( also verified here ) , is able to transduce signals after binding to the B-cell surface ( 15 , 24 ) .
EBV strain P3HR1 did not increase p53 levels in purified resting B cells , as shown in Fig .
1C .
Identical results were obtained with nontransforming UV-irradiated EBV strain B95-8 ( data not shown ) .
These studies show that p53 induction is not due to triggering of intracellular signaling pathways by the binding of EBV to CD21 on the cell surface .
EBNA-2 and LMP1 independently mediate the increase in p53 levels after EBV infection of resting B cells .
The timing of the observed increases in p53 in resting B cells following EBV infection suggested that EBNA-2 and latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) might be involved , since EBNA-2 is first detectable 12 to 24 h after infection and peak LMP1 levels are reached 4 to 6 days after infection ( 1 , 2 , 42 , 50 ) .
EBNA-2 is further implicated by the fact that P3HR1 is a deletion mutant lacking the gene coding for EBNA-2 ( 19 ) .
In order to evaluate this possibility , purified resting human B cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding EBNA-2 ( pSGS-EBNA-2A or SV-EBNA-2 [ 59 ] ) or LMP1 ( pSV2gpMTLM [ 58 ] ) , with both of these plasmids together , or with control plasmids pSV2gpt ( 35 ) and pSGS ( 17 ) by electroporation in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ( 10 ug of DNA , balanced by addition of vector DNA ; 4-mm-gap cuvettes ; 320 V and 960 uF ) .
Trivial expression of transfected plasmid DNAs in resting B cells was observed unless the cells were pretreated with recombinant gp105 , the ligand-binding portion of gp350/220 ( 55 ) , in immobilized form on tissue culture dishes ( 40 ng/ml for 20 h ) , as recently reported for the complete gp350/220 glycoprotein ( 50 ) .
Under such conditions , the transfection efficiency increased to 2 to 5 % , as assessed with a transfected pCMV-B-gal plasmid .
Cadmium chloride ( 6 wM ) was added 24 h posttransfection for induction , and total RNA was prepared ( approximately 2 % 10° cells per sample ; Micro-scale Total RNA Separator Kit , Clontech Laboratories ) from live cells by the use of Ficoll 72 h after transfection .
Reverse transcription-PCR ( 10 ug of cDNA per sample ) ( 32 ) was employed to assess the expression of p53 , EBNA-2 , LMP1 , and rpL32 , a housekeeping gene .
Upstream and downstream primers and amplified fragment lengths were as follows : 5-GTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCA-3 ' and 5-AAG GCCTCATTCAGCTCTC-3 ' ( 371 bp ) for p53 ; 5 GATGCCTGGACA-3 ' and 5-AGGCCITTGGTGGCATCAT G-3 ' ( 348 bp ) for EBNA-2 ; 5-GGTCTCTGGATCTACTTA TT-3 ' and 5-TCCACTCACGAGCAGGAGGT-3 ' ( 330 bp ) for LMP1 ; and 5'-ATGAATTCTCCTTCTCGGCATCATGG C-3 ' and 5'-CGGGATCCAGTTACGCTTAATT-3 ' ( 133 bp ) for rpL32 .
PCR products , after electrophoresis on 1 % agarose gels , were visualized with ethidium bromide .
As is evident from Fig .
2 , EBNA-2 expression in purified resting human B cells increased p53 transcription ; densitomet-ric analysis documented a twofold increase .
A 5-fold increase occurred in the LMP1-transfected cells , and a 10-fold increase was found in primary B cells transfected with both latent genes .

Vectors , cells transfected with both pSV2gpt and pSGS .
These are previously unreported actions of these EBV latent genes .
EBNA-2 and LMP1 upregulate p53 by activating the NF-KB transcription factor .
Recent studies have shown that LMP1 activates the NF-KB transcription factor ( 23 , 34 , 44 ) , leading to the expression of several genes , including the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) ( 18 ) ; A20 , a zinc finger protein which affords protection against the cytotoxic actions of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( 28 ) ; and IxB-related genes ( 20 ) .
A single study reported that EBNA-2 activates the HIV LTR via NF- « B induction ( 47 ) .
It has also been reported that tumor necrosis factor alpha mediates increased p53 levels by activating NF- « B , which then binds to an NF- « B consensus binding site in the p53 promoter ( 62 ) .
Because of these reports , we evaluated the possibility that EBNA-2 and LMP1 increase p53 levels during the early stages of infection via NF-xB activation .
In these studies , 293 primary human embryonal kidney cells were transfected with the EBNA-2 , LMP1 , or EBNA-2 plus LMP1 expression plasmids by the lipofectamine procedure ( Gibco BRL Life Technolo-gies , Inc. ) .
One microgram of each plasmid was used for all combinations , and the vectors ( pSV2gpt and pSG5 ) were used to balance the total amount of DNA .
Transfection efficiencies were adjusted to the same values , as determined by the expression of the pCMV-B-gal plasmid .
As shown in Fig .
3A , the 293 transfected cells expressed EBNA-2 , LMP1 , or both latent genes , as assessed by the West-etn blotting technique ( using EBNA-2 monoclonal antibody PE2 [ 64 ] , LMP1 monoclonal antibody S12 [ 33 ] , peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin G , and the ECL system ) 72 h after transfection .
Gel shift assays were carried out to determine whether EBNA-2 and LMP1 induced NF-kB-like nuclear proteins .
For these studies , nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 49 ) and 10 ug of protein per sample was evaluated for the ability to bind a double-stranded end-labeled oligonucleotide duplicating the NF- « B site in the NOTES 4851 | 44 a +4 $ & S LS _ U $ 35 § 30 9 A mame swe < - LMP ] LMP1 - o $ o- oto 4 + # EBNA2ZA oe ae e e ae Competitor p53wt - - - - We - p53mut - - - - - c- 4 NF-xB = e - - pe B FIG .

In order to determine whether activation of the p53 promoter was NF-kB dependent , 293 cells were cotransfected with the EBNA-2 , LMP1 , or EBNA-2 plus LMP1 expression plasmids together with one of two chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmids : pQ.5CAT or pMSCAT ( 62 ) .
The p0.5CAT construct contains approximately 500 bp of the wt p53 promoter ( -320 to +216 ) , as does the pMSCAT con-struct ; however , in the latter , the sequence GGGACTTTCCC } , which contains the NF- « B consensus binding sequence , has been mutated to ATCACTTTAAG .
As a positive control , the pU3R-IHII-CAT construct ( 43 ) , which contains two NF- « B sites in the HIV LTR , was also cotransfected with EBNA-2 , LMP1 , or EBNA-2 plus LMP1 .
Transfections were carried out as described above , and cell extracts were prepared 72 h later .
CAT assays were carried out using a CAT enzyme assay system ( Promega ) , as previously described ( 16 ) .
The percent acetylation of thin-layer chromatograms was quantitated by scanning with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
These assays showed that the p53CAT promoter construct containing the wt NF- « B binding sequence ( pO.SCAT ) was activated in cells which had been cotransfected with plasmids containing EBNA-2 , LMP1 , or both latent genes , as shown in Fig .
4 .
Transfectants expressing EBNA-2 produced a 3.8-fold increase , those expressing LMP1 exhibited an 11.8-fold increase , and those expressing both latent genes showed a 17.8-fold increase in CAT activity over background levels .
However , the p53CAT construct containing the mutated NF-KB site was not significantly activated by either EBV latent gene ( 3.6-fold maximal increase over background CAT activity ) , as seen in Fig .
4 .
EBNA-2 , LMP1 , and the two together activated the HIV-1 LTR ( 5- , 18.9- , and 37.9-fold over background , respectively ) , as previously reported ( 18 , 47 ) .
These studies definitively demonstrate that p53 induction by the EBV latent genes is mediated via NF- « B activation .
There are at least three possible explanations for the failure of the increased levels of wt p53 induced by EBV infection to block cell division and/or to induce apoptosis , and they are not mutually exclusive .
First , there may be a threshold level of p53 J. ViroL .
required for these effects which is not reached during EBV infection .
Second , downstream events which mediate p53-trig-gered cell cycle arrest or apoptosis may be blocked by EBV latent proteins or by EBV-induced cellular proteins .
Third , and we feel most likely , EBV-induced increases in c-myc ( 7 , 22 , 26 ) or in other cell cycle-regulating proteins , such as cyclin D2 , ede-2 , or cyclin E , all of which are increased by EBV infection ( 22 , 26 , 41 , 50 ) , may block the inhibitory effects of elevated p53 and p21/WAF1 levels and continuously drive the cells through normal cell cycle checkpoints .
Similar postulates have been made by others to explain other aspects of EBV immortalization ( 3 , 22 , 26 ) .
Studies of the mechanisms involved are under way .
