Nuclear Appearance of a Factor That Binds the CD28 Response Element within the Interleukin-2 Enhancer Correlates with Interleukin-2 Production* ( Received for publication , October 23 , 1995 , and in revised form , January 5 , 1996 ) Azem Civil } , Arjen Bakker§ , Irma Rensink ? , Stefan Lucien A.

The ability of T cells to produce interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) is a critical control point in T lym-phocyte activation .
The IL-2 enhancer contains a functional motif named CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) that serves a role as a target for mitogenic T cell activation signals .
The CD28RE sequence reveals similarity to the consensus « B binding motif .
Here we demonstrate that CD28RE binds an inducible protein with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa called nuclear factor of mitogenic-activated T cells ( NF-MATp35 ) that is clearly different from the known NF- « B/Rel family members .
Induction of NF-MATp35 was shown to depend on de novo protein synthesis and was restricted to T cells that received a mitogenic combination of T cell stimuli , not necessarily including CD28 signaling .
Nonmitogenic T cell stimulation did not result in appearance of NF-MATp35 .
These results indicate that mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals are integrated at the level of NF-MATp35 induction .
Similar to its effect on IL-2 production , cyelosporin A inhibited the induction of NF-MATp35 .
Taken together , these data demonstrate that the nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 shows excellent correlation with IL-2 production , which is a unique characteristic among nuclear factors implicated in the control of IL-2 gene expression .
Proliferation and maturation of resting T lymphocytes is an essential process in the T cell-mediated immune response .
Resting T lymphocytes can be activated via noncovalent interactions of the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) complex with a peptide in association with major histocompatibility complex molecules .
Besides TCR signaling , a second antigen-nonspecific costimulatory is required for optimal T cell activation , which is accompanied by the production of high levels of interleukin-2 * This study was supported in part by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research and the Onderzoeksschool Amsterdam-Leiden Institute for Immunology .

( IL-2 ) ( 1-3 ) .
IL-2 serves a function as autocrine growth factor for T cells allowing them to enter the S phase ( 4 , 5 ) .
Occupancy of the TCR without a costimulatory signal leads to aborted T cell activation and the development of functional unresponsive-ness or clonal anergy of T cells in which the T cells are incapable of producing IL-2 ( 1 , 6 ) .
Therefore , the ability of T cells to synthesize IL-2 is a critical control point in determining their participation in an immune response and consequently serves as a model system for the analysis of molecular events in T cell activation ( 7 ) .
Considerable evidence has indicated that signals delivered through the T cell accessory molecule CD28 constitute a major costimulatory pathway ( 8 ) .
This costimulatory signal is induced upon interaction of CD28 with its counterreceptors CD80 and CD86 that are expressed on the APC ( 9 , 10 ) .
Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD28 have been shown to serve as a valid substitute to mimic the CD80-CD86 interaction in CD28 triggering ( 11 , 12 ) .
Monoclonal anti-CD28 antibodies either cooperate with soluble anti-CD3 , which simulates antigen-spe-cific TCR triggering , or synergize with protein kinase C for the induction of IL-2 production and T cell proliferation .
Unlike the TCR-induced signaling pathway , the CD28 signal transduction route does not involve the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphos-phate or translocation of protein kinase C and is resistant to the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) ( 8 , 13 ) .
Recent evidence suggests that the CD28-induced signal is mediated via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 14-16 ) .
In addition , Su and colleagues ( 17 ) reported that simultaneous activation of TCR and CD28 results in a synergistic activation of c-jun kinase .
The latter observation implies that TCR and costimulatory signals become integrated at the level of c-jun kinase activation .
Human T cells respond to CD28 costimulation by a dramatic enhancement in the induction of IL-2 mRNA .
Two mechanisms account for the CD28 co-induced expression of the IL-2 gene .
CD28 costimulation has been shown to activate IL-2 gene transcription ( 18 , 19 ) and to prolong IL-2 mRNA half-life ( 20 , 21 ) .
Regulation of IL-2 gene transcription is controlled by an enhancer extending from -52 to -319 relative to the transcription initiation site ( 22 , 23 ) .
Specific regulatory sequences that bind the nuclear factors AP-1 , NF- « B , Oct-1 , and NF-AT1 have been implicated in regulation of IL-2 gene transcription ( re-viewed in Ref .
24 ) .
We and others have identified a sequence from -162 to -153 ( 5'-AGAAATTCCA-3 ' ) within the IL-2 enhancer that serves a crucial role as a response element for mitogenic combinations T cell activation signals ( 18 , 19 , 25 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
The sequence of the CD28RE motif is strongly conserved between the human and murine IL-2 gene .

of the sequence with that of binding motifs of known transcription factors reveals similarity to the consensus NF- « B binding motif ( 26 , 27 ) .
Only the first and the last ( tenth ) position differ from the consensus NF- « B binding motif ( 19 ) .
The significance of the sequence similarity has been shown by cross competition studies using CD28RE and the HIV-1 « B motif in combination with nuclear extracts of mitogenic-activated cells .
The HIV-1 kB motif efficiently competed for CD28RE binding activity , whereas CD28RE proved about 25-fold less effective in competition for HIV-1 « kB binding activity than the HIV-1 « B motif itself .
These data suggest that proteins involved in interacting with CD28RE are also involved in binding the HIV-1 « B motif .
In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that induction of CD28RE binding activity is restricted to T cells that received a mitogenic combination of T cell activation signals , not necessarily including CD28 ( 25 , 28 ) .
In order to characterize the proteins that constitute the CD28RE binding activity , we performed UV cross-linking analysis .
In this manuscript we describe the characterization of a protein called NF-MATp35 ( nuclear factor of mitogenic activated T cells ) that binds CD28RE .
Although evidence is presented that NF-MATp35 also binds to the « B motif , NF-MATp35 is clearly distinct from the known NF- « B/Re !
family members .
It is demonstrated that the induction of NF-MATp35 shows excellent correlation with IL-2 production .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-The human T cell leukemia line Jurkat was cultured in Iscove 's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 100 units/ml penicillin , and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin .
Cells were stimulated for 8 h at a density of 0.7 10° cells/ml as indicated ( monoclonal anti-CD28 ( CLB-CD28/1 ) at 5 pg/ml , anti-CD3 ( CLB-T3/4.E ) at 1 pg/ml , PMA at 10 ng/ml , ionomycin at 500 ng/ml , cyclosporin A at 100 ng/ml , and cycloheximide at 10 ug/ml ) .
Antisera-Antibodies for cell stimulation ( CLB-CD28/1 and CLB-T3/ 4.E ) were from the CLB in Amsterdam , The Netherlands .
Anti-NFxB1 ( # sc-114 ) , ant1-RelA ( # 3c-109 ) , and anti-c-Rel ( # 5c-71 ) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. ( Santa Cruz , California ) .
Expression Vectors-The eukaryotic expression plasmids that were used contained the NFxB1l-truncated ( at the Rsa-1 site ) coding sequence ( pC4 KBF-Rsa ) and the complete RelA ( pC4-65 ) and c-Rel ( pC4-85 ) coding sequences , respectively , under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promotor ( 41 ) .
COS-7 cells were transfected transiently with DEAE-dextran with either one the individual expression vectors or a combination of two .
After 48 h , cytosolic extracts were prepared by lysis of the cells in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES , pH 7.0 , 250 mM NaCl , 0.5 % Triton X-100 , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( 42 ) .
Proteins precipitated from these extracts with 25 % ( v/v ) saturated ammo-nium sulfate were resuspended in modified buffer D ( 42 ) .
Nuclear Extracts and Electromobility Shift Assay-Jurkat cells were stimulated as indicated and nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Ohlsson and Edlund ( 43 ) .
Nuclear proteins were finally precipitated with ( NH , ) ,50 , ( 0.3 g/m ! )
and dissolved in 50 mm HEPES , pH 7.8 , 50 mm KCl , 0.1 mm EDTA , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenyl-methylsulfony ] fluoride , and 10 % glycerol .
Binding reactions contained 6 ug of nuclear extract , 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 5 % glycerol , and 5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) and were incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to incubation with about 10,000 cpm of a *°P-labeled double-stranded probe for 30 min at room temperature in a total volume of 15 ul .
Antibodies were added 5 prior to the addition of the probe .
As probes we used CD28RE ( 5'-gateTTTGGAATTTCTT-3 ' ) and HIV-1 « B ( 5 -GAGGGGACTTTCCG-3 ' ) oligonucleotides .
Complexes were separated on 4 % polyacrylamide gels with 45 my Tris borate , 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0 buffer .
UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation-Bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdUrd ) -substituted oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer ( Millipore Expedite Nucleic Acid Synthesis System ) .
The following probes were used ( thymidines tagged with an asterisk are substituted by bromodeoxyuridine ) : CD28RE-1 , 5'-gateAAGAAATT*CCA-AAgatc-3 ' and 3'-ctagTTCTTT*AAGGTTTctag-5 ' ; CD28RE-2 , 5'-gate-AAGAAATT*CCAAAgate-3 ' and 3 '' -ctagTTCTT*TAAGGTTTctag 5 '' ; 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Identification of NF-MAT 8323 CD28RE-3 , 5'-gatcAAGAAATT*CCAAAgate-3 ' and 3'-ctagTTCT*T-TAAGGTTTctag 5 ; HIV-1 « B , 5'-gateGAGGGGACT*TTCCgate-3 ' and 3'-ctagCTCCCCT*GAAAGGctag 5 ' .
DNA binding reactions were performed by incubation of 12 ug of nuclear extract with the BrdUrd-substituted probe ( 1-5 X 10 '' cpm ) in the presence of poly ( dI-dC ) as a nonspecific competitor .
Nucleoproteins were first resolved by gel retardation prior to UV irradiation in situ ( UV Stratalinker , Stratagene ) .
Covalently linked nucleoprotein complexes were eluted from the gel and further analyzed by 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after precipitation with acetone .
For immunoprecipitation the eluted proteins were mixed with 1 pl of undiluted antiserum and protein A-Sepharose beads .
The bound proteins were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 44 ) .
RESULTS Characterization of CD28RE-binding Proteins by UV Cross-linking-Using gel retardation analysis , we and others ( 18 , 19 , 25 , 28 ) have demonstrated specific binding of an inducible nuclear factor with the CD28RE motif .
The CD28RE binding factor was found to be selectively induced by distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell stimuli , not necessarily including CD28 signaling ( 25 , 28 ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
We named this factor NF-MAT , which stands for nuclear factor of mitogenic activated T cells .
To characterize the inducible nucleoprotein ( s ) that constitutes NF-MAT , we performed UV cross-linking experiments with a 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-substituted CD28RE probe .
Nuclear extract of Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was incubated with this probe , and the protein-bound DNA fraction was separated by gel retardation and subjected to in situ UV irradiation .
Analysis of the cross-linked protein-DNA complexes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of two protein-DNA bands that migrated with molecular masses of 35 and 70 kDa , respectively ( Fig .
2B ) .
Next we applied UV cross-linking analysis to confirm that the CD28RE-protein complex that appeared upon stimulation of Jurkat cells via different modes of mitogenic T cell activation revealed the same pattern of protein-DNA bands as we observed for the complex induced by the combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Because the CD28RE-binding proteins selectively showed up in nuclei of mitogenic activated T cells , we refer to the proteins that correspond to the 35- and 70-kDa cross-linked adducts as NF-MATp35 and NF-MATp7O , respectively .
The actual molecular mass of these proteins could be slightly lower than that of the respective protein-DNA complexes due to the absence of covalently bound oligonucleotide .
NF-MATp35 May Bind CD28RE as a Dimer-Many nuclear proteins have been shown to bind their cognate binding motif as a dimer ( 26 , 27 , 29 ) .
Both homo- and heterodimers have been shown to be involved in DNA binding .
To explore the possibility that NF-MATp7O0 represents the dimeric form of NF-MATp35 , we performed UV dose titration experiments ( Fig .
3 ) .
These experiments revealed that upon short exposure ( F.e .
1 min ) the 35-kDa band predominated , whereas the balance shifted toward the 70-kDa band during long exposure ( 15 min ) .
This result suggests that the protein present in the 70-kDa complex represents the homodimer of the 35-kDa protein moiety .
NF-MATp35 Is Distinct from the Known NF- « B/Rel Family Members-The CD28RE sequence revealed similarity to the NF- « B consensus sequence ( 18 , 26 , 27 ) .
Based on the ability of kB motifs to compete for NF-MAT binding , we determined whether NF- « B immunoreactivity could be detected in the UV cross-linked CD28RE-protein complex .
In Fig .
44 it is demonstrated that none of the antibodies directed against the individual NF- « B/Rel proteins NFxB1 , Rel-A , and c-Rel were able to immunoprecipitate CD28RE cross-linked protein .
The capacity of these antibodies to immunoprecipitate NF- « B/Rel-DNA complexes was demonstrated using recombinant NF- « B/Rel A « -CD3 « -CD28 PMA Ionomycin 1 2 3 4 5 « -CD3 « -CD28 PMA Ionomycin Mw ( kDa ) -- - _ 106 _- 80 ne-mat pro - > - Suk M _- 49,5 NF-MAT p35 | -- * “ J -- 32,5 _- 27,5 sites - ( + > 1 2 3 Fic .

Time course of UV irradiation for cross-linking nucleoproteins to BrdUrd-substituted CD28RE-1 .
Nuclear extract from Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD28 plus anti-CD3 was incubated with BrdUrd-substituted CD28RE-1 and subjected to gel retardation .
Nucleoprotein-DNA complexes were UV irradiated for the time indicated and analyzed by 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
these observations , anti-CD3 or PMA alone proved to be effective in the induction of HIV-1 « B motif binding activity ( Fig .
5A ) .
When HIV-1 « B protein complexes formed in nuclear extracts of cells that received a single stimulus were compared with those from cells that were treated with a mitogenic combination of stimuli , we observed both quantitative and qualitative differences .
Complexes that appeared in nuclear extracts of cells that were treated with a mitogenic combination of stimuli revealed increased intensity and were extended with a form exhibiting enhanced mobility ( C2 ) .
In order to determine whether NF-MATp35 contributes to the HIV-1 NF- « B-protein complex , we performed UV cross-linking experiments with a BrdUrd-incorporated HIV-1 « B motif .
With nuclear extracts of nonmitogenic activated T cells , two major protein-DNA bands with molecular masses of approximately 70-85 kDa and 50 kDa , respectively , were observed ( Fig .
5B ) .
HIV-1 « B-protein complexes that were formed in nuclear extracts of cells that have received a mitogenic combination of activation signals contained an additional protein-DNA product with a molecular mass identical to that of the NF-MATp35-CD28RE complex .
Distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell activation conditions led to the inclusion of this protein in the HIV-1 « B-protein complex .
Similar to the NF-MATp35-CD28RE complex , the 35-kDa protein-HIV-1 « B complex could not be immunoprecipitated with anti-NFB1 , anti-RelA , and anti-c-Rel antibodies ( data not shown ) .
Induction of NF-MATp35 Is Dependent on de Novo Protein Synthesis-To determine whether nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 is dependent on de novo protein synthesis , we investigated the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on the mitogen-inducible nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 .
The addition of cycloheximide 30 min prior to stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 led to a dramatic reduction in the appearance of NF-MAT binding to CD28RE ( Fig .
6 ) .
This result indicates that either NF-MATp35 itself must be synthesized or that another protein needs to be synthesized that activates a pre-existing but inactive form of NF-MATp35 .
When the HIV-1 xB motif was used as a probe , cycloheximide selectively inhibited the appearance of the fast migrating moiety ( C2 ) of the mitogenic induced complex ( Fig .
7A ) .

Characterization of HIV-1 « B binding activity .

The probes used were the BrdUrd-substituted CD28RE-1 ( Fane 1 ) and HIV-1 kB sequence ( Zanes 2-7 ) .
Lanes 1 , 2 , and 6 , nuclear extract from Jurkat cells stimulated for 8 h with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ; lane 3 , with anti-CD38 ; lane 4 , with PMA ; lane 5 , with anti-CD3 plus PMA ; lane 7 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 plus cycloheximide .
cycloheximide resembles the complex induced upon nonmitogenic stimulation with anti-CD3 alone ( Fig .

UV cross-linking analysis with a BrdUrd-substituted HIV-1 xB motif shows that the complex that appears in the presence of cycloheximide is devoid of the p35 protein ( Fig .

Influence of cycloheximide and CsA on the appearance of NF-MAT .
Gel retardation analysis was performed with CD28RE as a probe , and nuclear extract from Jurkat cells was stimulated for 8 h in the absence ( Zane 1 ) or the presence of either cycloheximide ( lanes 2-4 ) or CsA ( Zanes 5-7 ) .
Lane 1 , cells stimulated with anti-CD3 plus PMA ; lanes 2 and 5 , anti-CD8 plus anti-CD28 ; lanes 3 and 6 , anti-CD3 plus PMA ; lanes 4 and 7 , anti-CD28 plus PMA .
ates the conclusion that the protein that constitutes the 35-kDa protein-HIV-1 « B complex is identical to NF-MATp35 .
Effect of CsA on the Nuclear Appearance of NF-MATp35-Next we studied the effect of CsA on the induction of NF-MATp35 .
For this purpose , we monitored the effect of CsA on the appearance of NF-MAT/CD28RE complex formation .
CsA prevented NF-MAT induction after treatment with anti-CD3 in combination of either anti-CD28 or PMA ( Fig .
6 ) .
Although the response of NF-MAT to the stimuli that included Ca** signaling was inhibited by CsA , the response to the combination of PMA and CD28 , a Ca**-independent mode of T cell activation , was not affected by CsA .
This result is in favor of the conclusion that distinct combinations of signaling pathways converge on the activation of NF-MAT .
The effects of CsA on the induction of NF-MAT are in perfect correlation with the effects of CsA on IL-2 production .
As anticipated we found a similar effect with CsA on the appearance of the fast migrating moiety ( C2 ) of the HIV-1 « B-protein complex ( Fig .
7B ) .
This result further substantiates the conclusion that this moiety represents the NF-MATp35 containing part of the complex .
DISCUSSION In this study we describe an approximately 35-kDa inducible protein , named NF-MATp35 , which interacts with the CD28RE within the IL-2 enhancer .
Distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals contribute to the nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 , indicating that there is a redundancy in the activation requirements of NF-MATp35 .
We previously reported that the CD28RE sequence displays similarity with the « kB enhancer consensus motif .
The Rel-related proteins c-Rel , NFxB1 , and RelA constitute a major class of xB enhancer-binding proteins .

( 28 ) were able to detect the presence of NF « B1 , RelA , and c-Rel among the proteins that bind CD28RE .
However , the affinity for NF- « B/Rel proteins is low as judged from competition experiments and UV cross-linking studies performed by us and others ( 19 , 30 , 31 ) .
Our data clearly demonstrate that NF-MATp35 is distinct from NFkB1 , RelA , and c-Rel .
First , the activation requirements of NF-MATp35 are more stringent than those for the induction of the NF- « B/Rel family members .
Second , the molecular mass of NF-MATp35 does not match those of the individual NF- « B/Re !
proteins .
Third , antibodies directed against NFxB1 , RelA , or c-Rel have not been successful in immunopre-cipitating NF-MATp35 covalently linked to CD28RE .
Finally , the appearance of NF-MATp35 is dependent on protein synthe-sis .
It is interesting that Fraser and Weiss ( 30 ) reported that the predominant protein species present in the CD28RC constitute three proteins of 35 , 36 , and 44 kDa .
The most abundant were the 35/36-kDa proteins .
It could be that NF-MATp35 is related to one of these proteins ; however , in contrast to NF-MATp35 , the CD28RC proteins require the contribution of the CD28 signaling for their nuclear appearance .
In addition , none of these proteins appears upon stimulation with anti-CD28 plus PMA but requires the addition of a third stimulus , i.e .
ionomycin .
Furthermore , Li and Siekevitz ( 31 ) described a 45-kDa Tax inducible protein ( TxREF ) distinct from NF- « B/Rel that specifically interacts with CD28RE .
This protein could be related to the 44-kDa protein described by Fraser and Weiss ( 30 ) .
The low affinity of CD28RE for binding NF- « B/Re !
proteins could be explained by differences in the 5 and 3 ' extremities between CD28RE and NF- « B/Rel binding motifs .
Analysis of the various NF- « B/Rel binding motifs has showed that the 5 and 3 ' ends of the recognition motif are the best conserved parts ( 32 ) .
Based on crystallographic analysis of NF- « B-DNA complexes , it is believed that these parts of the « B binding motif in particular are involved in NF- « B/Rel binding ( 33 , 34 ) .
The fact that NF-MATp35 binds to the « B elements as well as to CD28RE , whereas NF- « B/Rel proteins have a preference for the consensus-matching sequences , indicates that less variation is tolerated for binding of NF- « B/Rel proteins than for NF-MATp35 .
This might implicate that every « B element is in potency able to bind NF-MATp35 .
A functional role of CD28RE as a mitogen response element in the activation of the IL-2 enhancer stems from studies wherein a mutant enhancer with a nonfunctional CD28RE site anti-CD28 ; lanes 3 and 6 , anti-CD8 plus PMA ; lanes 4 and 7 , anti-CD28 plus PMA .
B , gel retardation assay was performed with HIV-1 xB as probe in the absence ( anes 1-4 ) or the presence ( Zanes 5-8 ) of antibodies directed against NF « B1 with nuclear extract from stimulated Jurkat cells .
Lanes 1 and 5 , cells stimulated for 8 h with anti-CD3 ; lanes 2 and 6 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ; lanes 3 and 7 , anti-CD3 in the presence of cycloheximide ; lanes 4 and 8 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 in the presence of cycloheximide .
610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Identification of NF-MAT 8327 was used in transient expression studies ( 18 , 19 ) .
In accordance with the requirements for NF-MATp35 induction , mutations within the CD28RE motif affected the IL-2 enhancer in its capacity to respond to mitogenic T cell activation signals .
Because CD28RE serves a role as a response element for distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals not necessarily including CD28 signaling , we propose to name the element MARS , which stands for mitogenic activation responsive sequence ( 35 ) .
IL-2 production is either completely resistant ( anti-CD28 plus PMA ) or sensitive ( anti-CD3 plus either anti-CD28 or PMA ) to the immunosuppressive action of CsA ( 13 , 36 , 37 ) .
Inhibition of IL-2 gene expression by CsA is explained by the negative effects of CsA on the nuclear expression of the cyto-plasmic component of NF-AT and the activation of Oct-1/AP1 , both known to be TCR-responsive nuclear proteins ( 37-40 ) .
Here we demonstrated that nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 is also sensitive to CsA .
The sensitivity of NF-MATp35 for CsA is , similar to IL-2 gene expression , dependent on the mode of mitogenic stimulation .
When Ca** influx is not involved in the signaling regime , NF-MAT still appears .
Taken together the above mentioned results show that the induction of NF-MATp35 reveals excellent correlation with activation of IL-2 gene expression ( Table I ) .
This is a unique characteristic among nuclear proteins implicated in IL-2 gene regulation and suggests a crucial role for NF-MATp35 in IL-2 gene regulation .
Similar to the induction of NF-MATp35 , the activation of c-jun kinase revealed excellent correlation with IL-2 production ( 17 ) .
However , based on supershift analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-c-jun antibodies , we could exclude the possibility that NF-MATp35 is identical to c-jun . ''
c-jun kinase is the only protein kinase among the kinases involved in mitogenic signaling described so far that requires mitogenic combinations of T cell stimuli for its activation .
This indicates that signal integration occurs at an even more prox-imal step in the events that lead to IL-2 gene transcription than NF-MATp35 induction .
Therefore , it is of interest to investigate whether NF-MATp35 is somehow involved in c-jun kinase signaling .
