Springer Granulocyte-macrophage colony factor ( GM-CSF ) and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) are produced by stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells .
The expression of GM-CSF and IL-2 is inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 .
Earlier studies on the IL-2 gene expression showed that overexpression of calcineurin ( CN ) , a Ca** /calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase , can stimulate transcription from the IL-2 promoter through the NF-AT-binding site .
In this study , we obtained evidence that transfection of the cDNAs for CN A ( catalytic ) and CN B ( regulatory ) subunits also augments transcription from the GM-CSF promoter and recovers the transcription inhibited by CsA .
The constitutively active type of the CN A subunit , which lacks the auto-inhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains , acts in synergy with PMA to activate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter .
We also found that the active CN partially replaces calcium ionophore in synergy with PMA to induce expression of endogenous GM-CSF and IL-2 .
By multi-merizing the regulatory elements of the GM-CSF promoter , we found that one of the target sites for the CN action is the conserved lymphokine element 0 ( CLEO ) , located at positions between -54 and -40 .
Mobility shift assays showed that the CLEO sequence has an AP1-binding site and is associated with an NF-AT-like factor , termed NF-CLEO y. NF-CLEO y binding is induced by PMA/A23187 and is inhibited by treatment with CsA .
These results suggest that CN is involved in the coordinated induction of the GM-CSF and IL-2 genes and that the CLEO sequence of the GM-CSF gene is a functional analogue of the NF-AT-binding site in the IL-2 promoter , which mediates signals downstream of T cell activation .
INTRODUCTION Activation of T cells by recognition of antigens on an-tigen-presenting cells leads to induction of nuclear proto-oncogenes such as c-fos in 15 to 30 min , followed by induction of a battery of lymphokine genes , including the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) genes ( Arai et al. , 1990 ; Ullman et al. , 1990 ) .

IP ; raises the cytoplasmic Ca** concentration from sequestered intracellular stores , thereby opening Ca** channels in the plasma membrane ( Berridge , 1993 ) .
This process can be functionally mimicked by a Ca** ionophore such as A23187 .
DG together with Ca** activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , and phorbol esters such as phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) can mimic the effect of DG .
Stimulation with PMA and Ca** 119 A. Tsuboi et al .
ionophore leads to considerable induction of several lymphokine genes in T cells ( Arai et al. , 1992 ) .
In par-ticular , there is strong synergy between PKC- and Ca**-signaling pathways in the production of GM-CSF or IL-2 ( Arai et al. , 1992 ; Riegel et al. , 1992 ) .
The expression of GM-CSF and IL-2 is inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( Arai et al. , 1992 ; Riegel et al. , 1992 ) .
Earlier studies on IL-2 gene expression revealed that a nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) plays a crucial role in transcriptional activation and is one of the functional targets for CsA and FK506 ( Riegel et al. , 1992 ) .
NFE-AT appears to consist of two factors : one is a ubiquitous nuclear factor ( NF-AT , , ) , induced through the PKC pathway and identified as AP-1 ( Jun- and Fos-family proteins ) ( Jain et al. , 1992 ) .
The other is a T cell-specific , pre-existing component ( NF-AT , ) , and translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus is regulated through the Ca** pathway and inhibited by CsA and FK506 ( Flanagan et al. , 1991 ) .
These drugs bind endogenous intracellular receptors ( immunophilins ) and the resulting complexes target a Ca**/calmodulin-dependent Ser/ Thr phosphatase , calcineurin ( CN ) , to exert immunosuppressive effects ( Schreiber and Crabtree , 1992 ) .
CN is composed of catalytic ( A ) and regulatory ( B ) subunits , and overexpression can restore the NF-AT-dependent transcription inhibited by CsA or FK506 in T cells ( Clipstone and Crabtree , 1992 ) .
In addition , a constitutively active form of the CN A subunit acts in synergy with PMA to activate transcription of the IL-2 gene through the NF-AT-binding site , thereby indicating that expression of activated CN can mimic a Ca** signaling pathway in T cells ( O'Keefe et al. , 1992 ) .
We have identified two elements , GM- « B/GC box ( formerly GM2/GC box ) and CLEO , as essential cis-elements of the mouse GM-CSF gene ( Miyatake et al. , 1988b , 1991 ; Heike et al. , 1989 ) .
Together these elements are responsible for maximal activation , induced by costimulation with PMA/A23187 in T cells ( Miyatake et al. , 1988b , 1991 ; Heike et al. , 1989 ) .
The GM- « B/GC-box sequence between -95 and -73 contains two DNA-binding motifs : one ( GGTAGTTCCC ) is recognized by an inducible factor , NF-GM2 and the other ( CCGCCC ) by a set of constitutive factors , A1 ( Spl ) , A2 , and B ( Sugimoto et al. , 1990 ) .
Purification of NF-GM2 from nuclear extracts of PMA/A23187-stimulated Jurkat cells revealed that the GM- « B sequence is recognized by NF-GM2 consisting of 50- and 65-kDa polypeptides which are immunologically indistinguishable from 50- and 65-kDa subunits of NF- « B , respectively ( Tsuboi et al. , 1991 ) .
Mutations in either GM- « B or GC-box sequence abolish the inducibility of the GM-CSF gene as well as the DNA binding of respective factors ( Sugimoto et al. , 1990 ) .
The other element , conserved lymphokine element 0 ( CLEO ) , extends from -54 to -40 downstream of the GM- « B/GC-box element and shares strong homology 120 with the 5'-flanking regions of the IL-4 and IL-5 genes ( Miyatake et al. , 1991 ) .
Mutations in the CLEO element fail to induce transcription from the GM-CSF gene as well as DNA binding to this sequence in response to PMA/A23187 ( Miyatake et al. , 1991 ) .
We report here that overexpression of CN augments transcriptional activation of the GM-CSF gene , presumably through the CLEO element .
Moreover , the CLEO element is associated with an NF-AT-like factor , whose binding is induced by PMA/A23187 and inhibited by addition of CsA .
The coordinated regulation of the GM-CSF and IL-2 genes through the CLEO-like element in T cells is discussed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture and Lymphokine Assays Jurkat cells ( a human T cell leukemia line ) , provided by Dr. P. Berg ( Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) , were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( JRH Biosciences ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum , penicillin G ( 100 U/m !
) , and streptomycin ( 100 mg/m ! ) .
Cells at a density of 2 X 10° cells/ml were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( 0-50 ng/ml , Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) and A23187 ( 0-2.5 uM , Calbiochem ) in the presence of CsA ( Sandimmun , Sandoz , Basel , Switzerland ) at the concentration of 0 to 1.0 ug/ml .
After incubation for 24 h , the supernatant was collected by centrifugation and subjected to ELISA for GM-CSF and IL-2 ( Abrams et al. , 1992 ) .
Mobility Shift Assays Nuclear extracts were prepared on a small scale , basically according to the method of Schreiber et al .
( 1989 ) after treatment of Jurkat cells ( 2-5 x 10 '' ) with 50 ng/ml PMA , 1 uM A23187 , or both in the presence or absence of 1 ug/ml CsA for 2-3 h ( Masuda et al. , 1993 ) .
In binding assays to the GC-box ( gm-mu 7.8 ) and GM- « B ( gm-mu 17.18 ) sequences , binding reaction and electrophoresis were done using 2.5 ug and 10 ug of nuclear extracts , respectively , as described elsewhere ( Tsuboi et al. , 1991 ) .
The binding reaction to the CLEO and NF-AT sequences was carried out in 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic ( MEPES ) -NaOH ( pH 7.9 ) , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 50 ug/ml poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) , 250 ug /ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , 100 mM KCI , ~0.5 ng of labeled probe ( ~50 000 cpm ) , and 12 ug of nuclear extracts .
After incubation for 30 min at room temperature , the sample was applied onto a 4 % native polyacrylamide gel in a tris ( hydroxymethyl ) aminomethane ( Tris ) -glycine-EDTA buffer .
The gel was dried and autoradiographed after electrophoresis at 120 V at room temperature .
Oligonucleotides for mobility-shift and competition assays are shown below as one strand , with the overhang in lower case .

pIL-2 Luc-1 was constructed by replacing the SRa promoter ( HindIII fragment ) of pSRa-L-AA5 ' ( Takebe et al. , 1988 ) with the IL-2 promoter ( HindIII fragment ) of pIL-2 CAT-1 .
pKC1 carrying a sequence -97 to +27 of the mouse GM-CSF gene linked to the CAT gene was constructed by replacing the Bg/II-BsfEII fragment of pmGMCAT-740 ( Miyatake et al. , 1988b ) with synthetic oligonucleotides ( N1 : N2 ) .

p ( GM- « B/GC-box ) , CAT and p ( CLEO ) , CAT ( Figure 6B ) were constructed by replacing the Bg ! lI-Sacl fragment of pmGMCAT-740 with synthetic oligonucleotides , which contain two copies of the GM- « B/ GC-box ( -91 to -72 ) and CLEO ( -70 to -37 ) sequences , respectively .
p ( CLEO ) ; CAT ( Figure 6D ) was also generated by replacing the Bgill-Sacl fragment of pmGMCAT-740 with synthetic oligonucleotides , which contain three copies of the CLEO sequence -57 to -37 linked by Bgill and Secl overhangs .
pBJ5-CNA and pBJ5-CNB , provided by Dr. N.A .
Clipstone ( Stanford ) , contain murine cDNAs for the A , , ; and B subunits of CN , respectively , under control of the SRa promoter ( Clipstone and Crabtree , 1992 ) .
A deletion mutant of the CN catalytic subunit ( pBJ5-CNAA ) , which lacks the putative auto-inhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains in the C-terminus , was also constructed by Dr. Clipstone .
Transfection , CAT and Luciferase Assays Transient transfection assay was done using the DEAE-dextran method ( Miyatake et al. , 1988a ) , except for the experiments of lymphokine production .
Jurkat cells ( 2 X 10 '' ) washed with Tris-buffered saline were suspended in 3 ml of the same buffer containing DEAE-dextran ( 0.5 mg/ml , Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) and 30-36 ug of total plasmid DNA , incubated for 20 min at room temperature , and mixed with 30 ml of culture medium containing 0.1 mM chloroquine diphosphate ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) .
After incubation for 1 h at 37°C , chloroquine-containing medium was replaced with 20 ml of culture medium .
The cell suspension was divided into four wells of a 6-well plate , cultured for 30 h , and treated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1 aM A23187 in the presence of 0 , 0.01 or 1 ug/ml CsA for 12-15 h. Cell extracts were prepared by four cycles of freezing and thawing , and subjected to CAT and luciferase assays .
CAT activity was measured by an AMBIS image analyzer as percentage conversion of [ `` *C ) chloramphenicol to 1- or 3-acetylated chloramphenicol after 6 h incubation at 37°C with 50 ug of cell extracts , as described previously ( Miyatake et al. , 1988a ) .
Luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer ( Monolight 2010 , Analytical Luminescence Laboratory , San Diego , CA ) with 10 ul of 50 ul cell extracts , followed by division of a value by a protein amount of 10 ul extracts , as described previously ( de Wet et al. , 1987 ) .
Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation ( Gene Pulsar , Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) to measure lymphokine production in these cells .
Cells ( 4 X 10 '' ) in 0.5 ml RPMI medium were mixed with 100 ug of DNA in 0.4 cm cuvettes ( Bio-Rad ) , pulsed at 300 V ( 960 LF ) , then left at room temperature for 10 min before addition of 10 ml of culture medium after which the mixture was transferred to plates .
After 36 h of incubation , the cells were harvested , suspended in 4 ml of culture medium , divided into four wells of 16-well plates and treated with various reagents for 24 h. Vol .
5 , January 1994 Activation of GM-CSF Gene by Calcineurin RESULTS CsA Blocks GM-CSF Production in Jurkat Cells Jurkat T cells produced GM-CSF when co-stimulated with PMA and A23187 ( Figure 1A ) .
The production was maximal when the cells were treated with 50 ng/ ml PMA and 1.0 4M A23187 .
Either PMA or A23187 did not induce the expression of GM-CSF .
The GM-CSF production , induced by PMA/A23187 , was inhibited in the presence of the immunosuppressive drug CsA , in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1B ) .

GM-CSF was measured by ELISA after 24 h incubation .
( B ) Jurkat cells were treated for 24 h with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and A23187 ( 1.0 uM ) in the presence of CsA ( 0 , 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1.0 ug/ml ) .
Results shown are the averages of 3 experiments .
121 A. Tsuboi et al .
IL-2 production was induced by co-stimulation with PMA/A23187 and was blocked by CsA treatment of Jurkat cells .
These results show strong synergy between PKC- and Ca**-signaling pathways for the production of GM-CSF and IL-2 , which is completely inhibited by addition of CsA .
CLEO Motif Is Recognized by a CsA-sensitive NF AT -like Factor Mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells were performed to identify PMA/A23187-induced nuclear factor ( s ) , whose binding is inhibited by the addition of CsA , in the GM-CSF promoter .
A1 , A2 , and B bindings to the GC-box sequence ( gm-mu 7.8 ) were constitutive and were not affected significantly by any treatment given ( Figure 2A ) .
NF- « B binding to the GM- « B sequence ( gm-mu 17.18 ) was significantly induced by PMA alone .
PMA/A23187 treatment slightly increased the NF- « B binding activity ( < 1.5-fold ) , and CsA treatment inhibited the PMA/A23187-induced binding , to the PMA-induced level ( Figure 2A ) .
We found in earlier mobility shift assays that the CLEO sequence gives rise to at least three DNA-protein com-plexes , termed NF-CLEO a , 8 , and y ( Masuda et al. , 1993 ) .
A basal level of NF-CLEO a and 8 was detected in the non-stimulated nuclear extracts and were induced markedly by PMA ( Figure 2B ) .
PMA/A23187 treatment further increased the a- and -binding activities less than threefold , and the addition of CsA was without effect ( Figure 2B ) .

In contrast , NF-CLEO y was not induced by PMA or A23187 alone , but was induced by PMA/A23187 ( Figure 2B ) .
This binding was completely blocked by adding CsA .
Interestingly , the NF-AT-binding sequence competitively inhibited NF-CLEO 7 binding , but not a and 8 bindings ( Figure 2C ) .
These results suggest that the CLEO element of the GM-CSF gene is one of the targets for the NF-AT-related factor , which is induced by co-stimulation with PMA/A23187 and blocked by CsA treatment .
Overexpression of CN Potentiates Transcriptional Activation from the GM-CSF Promoter in Jurkat Cells Since CN was shown to be implicated in the Ca**-signaling pathway of the IL-2 gene induction ( Clipstone and Crabtree , 1992 ; O'Keefe et al. , 1992 ) , we tested the effect of CN on transcription from the GM-CSF promoter .
pBJ5-CNA and pBJ5-CNB carry cDNAs for the catalytic ( A ) and regulatory ( B ) subunits of CN , respectively ( Clipstone and Crabtree , 1992 ) .
pKC1 is a CAT reporter construct carrying the GM-CSF promoter between positions -97 and +27 .
First we co-transfected pKC1 with a control vector pBJ5 into Jurkat cells .
PMA alone slightly stimulated transcription from the GM-CSF promoter , while A23187 alone did not .
PMA/ A23187 treatment synergistically induced transcription from the GM-CSF promoter , and this induction was inhibited by CsA , in a dose-dependent fashion ( Figure 3A ) .

After 30 h incubation , the cells were stimulated for 15 h with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ! )

Results are shown as thin layer chromatogram ( A ) , quantitated as fold induction of CAT activity compared with unstimulated cells ( A and B ) , and are the averages of 3 independent experiments .

CNB enhanced transcription from the GM-CSF promoter threefold and recovered the transcription inhibited by 0.01 ug/ml of CsA , compared with pBJ5 ( Figure 3A ) .
As a control experiment , we co-transfected pIL-2 CAT-1 ( -567 to +47 ) along with pBJ5-CNA and pBJ5-CNB into Jurkat cells .
Overexpression of CN augmented transcription from the IL-2 promoter more than threefold and restored the transcription reduced by CsA in the concentration of 0.01 ug/ml , compared with pBJ5 ( Figure 3B ) .
These results indicate that overexpressed CN potentiates transcriptional activation of the GM-CSF gene in response to PMA/A23187 and confers CsA resistance on the transcription .
Expression of Constitutively Active CN Acts in Synergy with PMA to Facilitate Transcription from the GM-CSF Promoter To further examine the CN action on the GM-CSF promoter , we carried out co-transfection experiments using Vol .

fection of pKC17 with pBJ5-CNAA enhanced transcription from the GM-CSF promoter 4.5-fold and rendered the cells more resistant to the effect of CsA ( 0.01 ug/ml ) , compared with pBJ5 ( Figure 4A ) .
As a control experiment , we co-transfected pIL-2 Luc-1 ( -567 to +47 ) along with pBJ5-CNAA into Jurkat cells .
Expression of the activated CN stimulated transcription from the IL-2 promoter 40-fold and also made the cells more resistant to the effect of CsA ( 0.01 ug/ml ) , compared with pBJ5 ( Figure 4B ) .
It would thus appear that the region between -97 and +27 of the GM-CSF promoter is responsible for the synergistic action of the activated CN with PMA .
Constitutively Active CN Acts in Synergy with PMA to Induce Production of Endogenous GM-CSF and IL-2 To determine whether increases in luciferase activity by the synergistic action of the constitutively active CN with PMA were indeed a consequence of enhancement of signals converging on the GM-CSF or IL-2 gene , we measured the amount of endogenous GM-CSF and IL-2 proteins , Culture supernatants from Jurkat cells , transfected transiently with the active CN , were assayed for GM-CSF and IL-2 levels , following treatment of various reagents .
Transfected cells with the control vector pBJ5 produced GM-CSF and IL-2 only when stimulated with PMA/A23187 ( Figure 5 , A and B ) .
In contrast , transfection with pBJ5-CNAA revealed that expression of the constitutively active CN synergized with PMA to induce production of GM-CSF and IL-2 , both of which were inhibited by the addition of CsA ( Figure 5 , A and B ) .
The levels of GM-CSF and IL-2 production were , however , lower compared with those induced by PMA/A23187 in the pBJ5-transfected cells .
Therefore , behavior of the plasmids pKC17 and pIL-2 Luc-1 reflects the levels of expression of the endogenous GM-CSF and IL-2 genes , respectively .
Exogenously Expressed CN Augments CLEO-Dependent Transcription To characterize CN responsive element ( s ) in detail , we divided the region between -91 and -37 into two seg-ments , followed by insertion into the minimal GM-CSF promoter ( position -36 to +27 ) .

Constitutively active CN acts in synergy with PMA to induce production of endogenous GM-CSF and IL-2 in Jurkat cells .
Cells ( 4 X 10 '' ) were transfected by electroporation either with 100 ug of pBJ5 or pBJ5-CNAA .
After 36 h incubation , the cells were harvested , suspended in culture medium , divided into 4 wells of 16-well plates and stimulated for 24 h with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and/or A23187 ( 1 LM ) in the presence of CsA ( 0 or 1.0 ug/ml ) .
Results presented are the averages of 3 independent experiments .
Detection limits in ELISA were 40 pg/ml for GM-CSF and 200 pg/ml for IL-2 .
higher than that in p ( GM- « B/GC-box ) , CAT .
It may well be that the CLEO element more than the GM- « B/ GC-box sequence is responsible for both the inducibility by PMA/A23187 and the potentiation by CN .
We then constructed a plasmid containing three copies of the CLEO element ( position -57 to -37 ) upstream of the basal GM-CSF promoter ( Figure 6D ) .
Co-transfection of p ( CLEO ) , ; CAT with pBJ5-CNA and pBJ5-CNB showed that expression of CN augmented the CLEO-dependent transcription threefold compared with pBJ5 ( Figure 6C ) .
These results indicate that like the NF-AT site of the IL-2 gene , the CLEO element of the GM-CSF Molecular Biology of the Cell gene is one target for enhancement of transcription by CN and for induction through the PKC- and Ca**-signaling pathways in activated T cells ( Figure 7 ) .
DISCUSSION In T cells , co-stimulation with phorbol esters ( PMA ) and Ca* '' * ionophores ( A23187 ) leads to considerable activation of several lymphokine genes .
We have found that production of IL-2 or GM-CSF shows strong synergy between PKC- and Ca**-signaling pathways both in murine cloned T cells ( Arai et al. , 1992 ) and in Jurkat cells ( Figure 1A ) .
In cloned T cells , certain lymphokines are partially activated by PMA alone ( IL-5 , IL-6 , and IL-10 ) or A23187 alone ( IL-3 , IL-4 and interferon [ IFN ] -y ) ( Arai et al. , 1992 ) .
CsA completely inhibits the IL-2 and GM-CSF production induced by PMA/A23187 in both these T cell lines ( Figure 1B ) .
In the cloned T cells , CsA almost completely blocks the IL-3 , IL-4 , and IFN-y production induced by PMA/A23187 ( Arai et al. , 1992 ) .
Our results are consistent with the observation that in activated human lymphocytes , CsA and FK506 inhibit accumulation of transcripts from early T cell activation genes , including IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IFN-y , TNF-a , and GM-CSF ( Tocci et al. , 1989 ) .
Earlier studies on the IL-2 gene showed that both transcriptional activation through two NF-AT sites and an Oct-1 ( octamer factor-1 ) /OAP-40 ( octamer-asso-ciated protein-40 ) site ( Figure 7 ) and the respective DNA bindings are highly sensitive to CsA and FK506 ( Riegel et al. , 1992 ) .
NF-AT consists of two factors : a ubiquitous nuclear factor ( NF-AT , ) , identified as AP-1 consisting of Jun-Fos heterodimers such as Fral /JunB ( Jain et al. , 1992 ; Boise et al. , 1993 ) , and a T cell-specific , pre-existing component ( NF-AT , ) , whose translocation from cytoplasm into nucleus is inhibited by CsA and FK506 ( McCaffrey et al. , 1993 ; Northrop et al. , 1993 ) .
In foregoing work ( Masuda et al. , 1993 ) , we demonstrated that the CLEO element of the GM-CSF promoter is recognized by NF-CLEO y with a relatively weak affinity .
NF-CLEO 7 is induced by PMA/A23187 , abolished by the addition of CsA ( Figure 2B ) and competitively inhibited by NF-AT oligonucleotides ( Figure 2C ) .
NF-CLEO y has other characteristics similar to NF-AT , since it appears to be composed of AP-1 and 120 kDa protein ( Tokumitsu et al. , 1993 ) .
The CLEO element shares partial homology with the -binding site ( TTTCCTC , Figure 7 ) , which is closely related to the consensus binding sequence for Ets-family proteins ( Wasylyk et al. , 1993 ) .
Interestingly , the CLEO sequence contains an AP-1 -like site juxtaposed directly with the Ets-binding site ( Figure 7 ) .
The CLEO-AP-1 site ( TTAATCA ) is similar to the AP-1 consensus sequence ( TGAG/CTCA ) , and differences are probably not critical for binding of the Jun-Fos heterodimer ( Risse et al. , 1989 ) since AP-1 can bind to the CLEO sequence with a high affinity ( Tokumitsu et al. , 1993 ) .
NF-CLEO a and $ are induced Vol .
5 , January 1994 Activation of GM-CSF Gene by Calcineurin mainly by PMA ( Figure 2B ) and share most properties with AP-1 ( Masuda et al. , 1993 ) .
CsA and FK506 tightly bind distinct families of im-munophilin ( Schreiber and Crabtree , 1992 ; Sigal and Dumont , 1992 ) , and the resulting complexes associate with CN to inhibit phosphatase activity ( Fruman et al. , 1992 ) .
It has been reported that CN is expressed at a low level in T cells ( Kincaid et al. , 1987 , 1990 ) , whereas the immunophilins are relatively abundant ( Sigal and Dumont , 1992 ) .
We showed that as in the case of the IL-2 gene ( Figure 3B ) , overexpression of CNA/CNB augments transcription of the GM-CSF gene and restores the transcription inhibited by CsA in Jurkat cells ( Figure 3A ) .
We also found that the constitutively active form of CNA subunit synergizes with PMA to stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter ( Figure 4A ) , as described in the earlier study on the IL-2 promoter ( O'Keefe et al. , 1992 ) .
Finally we demonstrated that the constitutively active CN acts in synergy with PMA to induce production of endogenous GM-CSF and IL-2 ( Figure 5 , A and B ) .
In both cases , the levels of induction by PMA are lower than those induced by PMA / A23187 in mock-transfected cells , as probably related to transfection efficiency .
This would not , however , account for the low levels of lymphokine production induced by PMA/A23187 in CNAA-transfected cells .
Furthermore , CLEO sequence-dependent transcription is stimulated by the expression of CNA/CNB ( Figure 6C ) as well as by that of the constitutively active type .
Unexpectedly , the transcriptional enhancement of p ( CLEO ) ; CAT and p ( CLEO ) , ; CAT constructs by CN was not inhibited by CsA .
Transcription from tandemly repeated AP-1 sequences was seen to be stimulated by FK506 in the presence of PMA /ionomycin ( Ullman et al. , 1993 ) .
This may account for the failure of CsA in repression of the transcriptional enhancement by CN , since the effect of the strong AP-1-binding site in the CLEO sequence may become more dominant than that of the weak NF-AT-like-binding site when the CLEO element is multimerized .
There has been no direct evidence that endogenous CN is implicated in activation of the GM-CSF and IL-2 genes through Ca** signaling .
Co-transfection experiments can be done to determine whether overexpression of the auto-inhibitory domain of the CNA subunit reduces activation of these promoters in response to PMA/A23187 , since a high dose of a peptide to this domain inhibits the phosphatase activity in vitro ( Hashimoto et al. , 1990 ) .
A dominant negative mutant of CNA subunit , which lacks only the phosphatase ac-tivity , may also be useful to block activation of endogenous CN in response to the Ca** signaling by com-petition .
These strategies , however , may not be feasible in transient transfection assays because at least two subtypes of the CN catalytic subunit have been identified by molecular cloning ( Kincaid et al. , 1990 , 1991 ) .
125 A. Tsuboi et al .
It also has been reported that in addition to NF-AT and OCT-1/OAP-40 , CsA and FK506 inhibit , by ~50 % , both NF- « B binding to the immunoglobulin « light chain enhancer ( Ig- « B ) sequence and the ability of multimerized Ig- « B sequences to activate expression from a reporter plasmid in response to PMA /ionomycin ( Emme et al. , 1989 ; Mattila et al. , 1990 ) .
NF- « B binding is less sensitive to these immunosuppressants since it is largely induced by PMA alone .
The increased level of NF- « B activity ( binding and transcription ) induced by addition of ionomycin is completely inhibited by CsA and FK506 in Jurkat cells ( Emmel et al. , 1989 ; Mattila et al. , 1990 ) .
We reported earlier that authentic NF- « B binding to the GM- « B site is weaker than that to the Ig- « B sequence ( Tsuboi et al. , 1991 ) .
Since PMA/A23187-induced binding to the GM- « B site is inhibited down to a PMA level by CsA ( Figure 2A ) , we can not exclude the possibility that the GM- « B site may be another target for CsA effects ; this contribution , if any , would be less significant than that of the CLEO element .
There are reports that the Ig- « B and HIV- « B sequences can be recognized by an -like , CsA-sensitive factor under certain conditions of binding reaction or stimulation ( Schmidt et al. , 1990 ; McCaffrey et al. , 1992 ) .
These « B sequences contain GGGACTITCC and share homology with the above Ets-binding site ( TTTCC ) .

However , certain « B sequences may be other candidates for the CsA action through NF-AT -like proteins .
The CLEO element of the GM-CSF promoter seems to be one of the targets for the CsA and CN actions ( Figure 7 ) , as described elsewhere ( Randak et al. , 1990 ) .
Mobility shift assays ( Figure 2A ) and co-transfection experiments ( Figure 6A ) suggested that the GM- « B sequence may be another target for the CsA and CN ef-fects .
Transfection experiments using GM-CSF CAT constructs with the CLEO or GM- « B/GC-box mutation revealed that cooperation between the CLEO and GM- « B/GC-box elements is required for both maximal activation of the GM-CSF promoter and its enhancement by exogenous CN expression .
It has been reported that an intergenic enhancer , located between human GM-CSF and IL-3 genomic genes , may participate in the inducibility of both genes and be a target for CsA in-hibition .
( Cockerill et al. , 1993 ) .
This enhancer contains four AP-1 binding sites , three of which are associated with an NF-AT-like factor and are similar to the CLEO element ( Cockerill et al. , 1993 ) .
To account for activation of the endogenous GM-CSF gene as well as its sensitivity to CsA , interaction between the distal and prox-imal CLEO-like elements should be also considered in the mouse GM-CSF/IL-3 locus .

We also found a homologous sequence with the CLEO element in the 5'-flanking region of the mouse IL-3 gene ( AGAGCCAGGCTACTTCCTCC ) between positions -262 and -243 ( Miyatake et al. , 1985 ) .
CsA blocks production of GM-CSF , IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 , induced by PMA/A23187 in the murine cloned T cells as described above ( Arai et al. , 1992 ) .
Therefore , we assume that the CLEO -like sequence may be involved in coordinated induction of the GM-CSF , IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 genes through the Ca**- and PKC-signaling pathways mediated during T cell activation .
Use of mouse type 2 helper T cell clones , which produce IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , and GM-CSF will facilitate testing as to whether CN or CsA affects transcription of these genes through the CLEO-like sequence .
