1355-1361 , 1993 Printed in U.S.A. Involvement of Alu Sequences in the Cell-specific Regulation of Transcription of the y Chain of Fc and T Cell Receptors* ( Received for publication , August 18 , 1992 ) Anna T. Brinig , Gai M. Lee , and Jean-Pierre Kinet From the Molecular Allergy and Immunology Section , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Rockville , Maryland 20852 The FeeRI-y chains are expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells where they play a critical role in signal transduction .
They are part of the high affinity IgE receptor in mast cells , basophils , Langerhans cells , and possibly other cells ; a component of the low affinity receptor for IgG ( FeyRIIIA or CD16 ) in natural killer cells and macrophages ; and part of the T cell antigen receptor in subsets of T cells .
Here we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the y chain gene by analyzing the 2.5-kilobase sequence upstream of the transcription start site .
This sequence contains a promoter specific to cells of hematopoietic lineage .
However , the tissue specificity of this promoter is only partial because it is active in all of the hematopoietic cells tested here , regardless of whether they constitutively express FeeRI- y chain transcripts .
We have identified two adjacent cis-acting regulatory elements , both of which are part of an Alu repeat .
The first ( -445/-366 ) is a positive element active in both basophils and T cells .
The second ( -365/-264 ) binds to nuclear factors , which appear to be different in basophils and T cells , and acts as a negative element in basophils and as a positive one in T cells .
Thus , this Alu repeat ( 90 % identical to Alu consensus sequences ) has evolved to become both a positive and negative regulator .
The y chains initially described as subunits of the high affinity IgE receptor ( FeeRI ) ® are expressed in various hematopoietic cells and are part of several receptor multimeric complexes ( 1-3 ) .
Homodimers of y chains , together with an « and a 8 chain , form the tetrameric FeeRI receptor in mast cells , basophils , and Langerhans cells ( 4-6 ) .
The same y7 homodimers also associate with the low affinity receptor for IgG ( FeyRIII , CD16 ) in mast cells , basophils , and monocytes ( 7 ) .
In addition to forming disulfide-linked homodimers , the y chains interact with two other homologous proteins , the ¢ and 7 chains of the T cell antigen receptor .
These three chains generate six different dimers , the yy , { { , and » » homodimers * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C .

'The abbreviations used are : FceRI , high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; uF , mi-crofarads ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; RBL , rat basophilic leukemia ; Alu repeat , major interdisperse repetitive nucleotide sequence in the mammalian group .
and the y { , y7 , and { » heterodimers , all of which associate with the T cell antigen receptor in some subsets of T lymphocytes ( 8-10 ) .
The y7 , { { homodimers and the y { heterodimers are also part of the low affinity IgG receptor ( CD16-FceyRIII ) in natural killer cells ( 11-15 ) .
The y , ¢ , and 1 chains belong to the same family of mole-cules .
Their respective genes show a similar genomic organization and are located on mouse and human chromosome 1 ( 16-23 ) .
Furthermore , they contain homologous amino acid motifs which appear to be critical to the initiation of receptor-mediated signal transduction ( 3 ) .
Previously , our laboratory has characterized cDNA and genomic clones for the human FeeRI-y chain ( 16 ) .
The gene consists of five exons and spans 4 kilobases .
There is a major start site localized 25 base pairs upstream of the start codon , but a few additional start sites are also present .
The gene does not show a typical TATA box but contains inverted CAAT and GC boxes at positions -199 and -135 , respectively .
This gene is constitutively expressed in certain cell types such as basophils ( 1 ) but is only expressed in subsets of others cells such as T lymphocytes ( 8-10 ) .
In this study , we have characterized the 5 region and the promoter of the FeeRI-y gene and have detected the presence of positive and negative cis-acting elements .
We show that the promoter is hematopoietic-specific and that Alu sequences play a role in the positive and negative regulation of transcrip-tion .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sequencing the 5'-Flanking Region of the Human FceRI-y Gene-A genomic clone longer than the one previously described and sequenced ( 16 ) was isolated .
A 5-kilobase Sall fragment was subcloned into the pBS+ vector ( Stratagene ) , and a restriction map was estab-lished .
A 2.2-kilobase HindlII/BgilI fragment corresponding to the 5 '' sequence of the gene was isolated , subcloned , and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using 21-base pair unlabeled oligonucleotide primers as described before ( 16 ) .
Plasmid Construction-DNA from a genomic clone was used as the template in a polymerase chain reaction to generate various fragments of the 5'-flanking region of the FeeRI-y gene .
Oligonucleotides ( 24-mer ) starting at positions -445 , -295 , ~237 , -161 , ~95 , and -54 were chosen as 5 primer , and the 3 ' primer was the same oligonucleotide ending at position +26 .
Convenient restriction sites were added to each oligonucleotide .
The polymerase chain reactions were performed according to standard procedures in a 100-ul reaction volume containing 1.5 mm MgCl ; , 50 pmol of primers , 1 unit of Taq polym-erase , and 200 uM dNTPs .
The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the HindIII and Xbal sites of the pCAT-basic vector ( Promega ) .
The -2382/+26 construct was generated by ligation of the -2382/ -180 restricted fragment into HindIII and BeilI sites of the -445 construct .
The ~1631 , ~1296 , and -365 CAT constructs were generated by excising the HindIII and Ciel , HindIII and PpuMI , HindlIl , and Acc !
fragments respectively , from the -2382 construct prior to religation .
The -445 gap ( -365/-264 ) CAT construct was obtained by a two 1355 1356 step polymerase chain reaction .
The -445/-264 ( HindIlI/Accl ) fragment was inserted upstream ( Bg/Il ) or downstream ( BamHI ) of the SV40 promoter in the pCAT-promoter vector ( Promega ) .
Standard procedures were used in all plasmid constructions ( 24 ) .
Both strands of each constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing as above .
Cells-The CEM-CM-3 , Jurkat , HeLa , COS-7 , U937 , HL-60 cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection .
The human basophilic KU812 cell line was a gift from Dr. K. Kishi ( 25 ) ; the Daudi cell line was from Dr. M. Schwabe NCI-Frederick , MD ; the NK 3.3 cell line was a gift from Dr. J. Kornbluth ( 26 ) .
These cells were propagated in the recommended media , supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 2 mM glutamine , and antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; and 95 % air .
RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as described previously ( 27 ) .
Transfection-Cells growing in suspension were transfected while in exponential growth , whereas adherent cells were transfected when 70-80 % confluent .
DNA was transfected into HeLa , U937 , and COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method ( 24 , 28 ) .
The other cell lines were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus .
500 wl of the various cells in complete medium was electroporated using the following conditions : 5 x 10° Jurkat cells , 300 volts and 500 F ; 5 x 10° CEM-CM-3 cells , 200 volts and 960 uF ; 1 x 10 '' RBL-2H3 cells , 250 volts and 500 uF ; 1 x 10° KU812 cells , 330 volts and 960 uF .
Cotransfection of pCMV-B-galactosidase plasmid ( 29 ) , which comprises an Escherichia coli LacZ gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter , was used as a control and to determine the best conditions for transfection .
Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection , washed twice with cold phosphate buffered saline , and lysed by repeated cycles of freeze-thawing in 250 mM Tris ( pH 7.9 ) .
Enzyme Assays-The -galactosidase assay was performed as described ( 24 ) with 10-30 ug of protein .
The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method ( 30 ) .
The CAT activity in cell lysates , normalized for protein concentrations and for unit of B-galactosidase , was determined by a slight modification of the method described by Gorman et al .
( 31 ) .
In short , the acetylated chloramphenicol was separated from the nonacetylated form by thin-layer chromatography and developed in chloroform/methanol ( 95:5 , v/v ) .
The radioactivity of each acetylated and nonacetylated spot was directly determined with the Ambis radioanalytic imaging system .
CAT activity is expressed as acetylated forms/total X 100/100 units of -galactosidase .
Every transfection experiment was performed in duplicate .
The results are expressed as the means ( * S.E .
or S.D as indicated ) of at least three different transfections for each construct and for each cell line .
Nuclear Extract Preparation-Nuclear extracts were prepared as outlined by Dignam et al .
( 32 ) .
Buffers A , C , and D contained 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol to minimize proteolysis .
Cells were incubated on ice in 5 volumes of buffer A .
After 10 min cell membranes were disrupted by 12 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer ( pestle B ) , and the intact nuclei were pelleted for 20 min in a microcentrifuge at 4°C .
The nuclei were broken by 10 strokes of the Dounce homogenizer in 2 volumes of buffer C and then stirred for 30 min at 4 °C .
The nuclear extract was then clarified by centrifugation ( as above ) and dialyzed against buffer D for 2 h. The total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method ( 30 ) .
Aliquots of nuclear extract were used immediately or stored at -80 °C for later use .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSAs ) -Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described ( 33 ) with modifi-cations .
The double-stranded DNA fragments spanning the sequences -445/~180 , -445/-264 , and -445/-365 of the y gene were generated by enzymatic digestion and isolated by standard techniques ( 24 ) .
The fragments were end labeled using [ « -*P ] ATP and [ « -*P ] GTP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham Corp. ) by Klenow-large fragment polymerase .
The probe , spanning the region -366/ -- 290 was generated by synthesizing two complementary 77-mer oligonucleotides and by annealing the two oligonucleotides at an equimolar ratio in the presence of 150 mM NaCl .
The resultant double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide was gel purified on a 12 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and subsequently end labeled with [ y-*P ] JATP and T4 kinase .
All probes were purified twice over a Sephadex G-25 column .
The unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides used for competition experiments , including those corresponding to the binding sites for NF-kB ( 84 ) and AP-1 ( 35 ) , were prepared and purified as described above .
The poly ( dA ) -poly ( dT ) double-stranded oligonucleotide was purchased from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc .
Binding assays were carried out in a binding buffer containing 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7.8 ) , 60 mM KC1 , 0.2 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , Transcriptional Regulation of the FeeRI- » y Chain Gene 1 mM MgCl » , 5 % glycerol , about 0.5-1 ng of P -labeled DNA fragment ( 2 x 10° cpm ) , 1 or 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) or poly ( dG - dC ) ( Pharmacia ) , as indicated , and 2-30 ug of nuclear extract in a total volume of 20 ul .
Since the ~366/-290 sequence is an AT-rich region and contains 23 adenines , we performed EMSA with this probe using two different nonspecific polyanion competitors ( poly ( dI -dC ) and poly ( dG -dC ) ) to unmask complexes which would be undetectable only in the presence of poly ( dI-dC ) ( 36 , 37 ) .
For competition experiments , the 100- or 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor was added to the binding reaction 5 min before the radiolabeled probe .
Extracts and probes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then analyzed either on a 5 or a 8 % polyacrylamide nondenaturing 0.5 x TBE gel ( acrylamide : bisacrylamide ratio of 38:2 ) depending on the length of the probes .
Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film without intensifying screens for a few hours or overnight .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Consensus Sequences for cis-Acting Elements in the 5'-Flanking Region of the Human FeeRI-y Gene-As a first step in the characterization of the regulatory sequences involved in the transcriptional control of the human FceeRI-y chain gene , we completed the sequencing of the 5 -flanking region of the gene from a previously described genomic clone ( Fig .
1A ) .
This allowed us to localize a number of consensus sequences for potential cis-acting regulatory elements ( Fig .
1B ) , among which are mast-cell specific elements ( GATA ) , T cell-specific elements ( Lyf-1 , CTF-1 ) , SP-1 sites , an inverted CAAT box , several y-interferon- and six interleukin-6-re-sponsive elements ( 38 ) .
The y-interferon elements are likely involved in the up-regulation of the FeeRI-y mRNA levels induced by y-interferon in purified monocytes and in the U937 cell line . ''
In addition , we identified two Alu repeats , one between -2131 and -2358 and another between -313 and -582 from the ATG start codon ( see also below ) .
Identification of a Hematopoietic-specific Promoter-To identify the important regulatory elements of the -flanking region of the gene , we inserted various fragments in an expression vector immediately upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene and analyzed the effect of the various deletions on the transcription of the CAT gene in transfected cells .
Cotransfection of a pCMV-B-galactosidase plasmid with the CAT constructs allowed the systematic monitoring of the transfection efficiency by enzymatic assay .
The rationale of the different deletion constructs shown in Fig .
24 is as follows .
The -95 construct ends 3 ' of an SP-1 site , the -161 construct contains this SP-1 site , the -237 construct contains the inverted CAAT box , and the -295 construct ends 3 '' of a stretch of 23 consecutive adenines .
The remaining constructs were generated from convenient enzymatic restriction sites .
The analysis of the relative CAT activity in rat basophilic leukemia cells ( RBL-2H3 ) , in the human basophilic cell line KUS12 , and in non-hematopoietic HeLa cells is shown in Fig .
2B .
A similar analysis in T cells ( the CEM-CM-3 and the Jurkat cell lines ) and HeLa cells is shown in Fig .
2C .
No activity is detected in transfected HeLa cells , regardless of the construct and despite a high level of transfection effi-ciency .
By contrast , the -2382 construct shows a substantial activity in basophils ( 7.4 % ) and a basal activity in T cells ( 1.17 % ) .
However , the -1637 construct has no activity in either cell type with the possible exception of KU812 cells , in which a weak activity is detected .
Furthermore , the ~1296 construct shows an activity higher than the one observed for the -1637 construct , except again in KUS812 .
Taken together , these data suggest that the promoter is active in basophils and T cells but not in non-hematopoietic cells ; that the sequence between -1296 and -1631 contains a * A. Brini and J.-P. Kinet , unpublished data .

The 5'-flanking sequence of the human FceeRI-y chain gene .
Panel A , nucleotide sequence of the 2,408-base pair fragment spanning the 5 ' -flanking region of the human FeeRI-y chain gene .
Position 1 corresponds to the start codon .
Alu repeats and consensus sequences for GATA , AP-1 , AP-2 , CF-1 , cAMP-responsive element , SP-1 , and CAAT box are underlined .
The stretches of Alu sequences are typed in italics , the Lyf-1 and TCF-1 binding sites are overiined , and the putative `` y motif '' found three times in the y 1357 negative element that down-regulates the transcription to almost undetectable levels ; that the sequence between -1637 and -2382 confers a basal level of transcription in T cells and a higher level in basophils possibly because of the presence of a GATA site found at -1807 .
To confirm the specificity of the promoter for hematopoietic cells we also transfected COS-7 cells , the monocytic cell line U937 , and the B cell line Daudi , with the -2382 construct .
No activity was detected in non-hematopoietic COS-7 cells , whereas a basal CAT activity was observed in U937 and Daudi cells ( data not shown ) .
The Promoter Confers Only Partial Tissue Specificity-Among the hematopoietic cells chosen for transfection , the RBL-2H3 , KUS812 , CEM-CM-3 , and U937 cells express FeeRI-y transcripts constitutively , whereas Jurkat and Daudi cells do not .
However , there is no difference in the promoter activity in the transfected cells according to whether or not they express the FceeRI-y transcripts .
Therefore , the promoter analyzed here is responsible for only part of the tissue specificity ( i.e .
hematopoietic ) but not for the complete specificity ( i.e .
transcription in -positive cells ) .
It is possible that other regions of the gene may control the specificity of expression in FeeRI-y-positive cells .
More likely , gene methylation may confer that specificity as shown for the gene of the { chain of the T cell antigen receptor , a gene homologous to the y gene analyzed here ( 39 ) and for other genes as well ( 40 ) .
Alternatively , the interaction of nuclear factors with the gene may be affected by different DNA structures in various cell types .
The -445/-205 Fragment Contains a Strongly Positive , Hematopotetic-specific Element-The most significant finding of the functional analysis with the deletion constructs is the identification of a strongly positive region between -445 and -295 ( Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
This element is at least four times more potent in basophils than in T cells and is inactive in HeLa cells , It is 30 x more potent in RBL cells than the SV40 promoter and 3 X more potent in T cells ( not shown ) .
In addition , it is active in many other hematopoietic cells including U937 , THP1 , and HL-60 , NK 3.3 , murine CTLL and Daudi but not in COS-7 ( not shown ) , confirming its specificity to cells of hematopoietic lineage .
However , similar to what is observed for the full-length construct , this element is active in both FceRI-y-negative and FeeRI-y-positive hematopoietic cells .
Effect of the -445/-264 Fragment on a Heterologous Promoter-To test if the -445/-264 region could also up-regulate the activity of a heterologous promoter , we inserted the -445/ -~264 fragment upstream or downstream of the SV40 pro-moter-driven CAT gene ( Fig .
34 ) .
The fragment has no apparent effect on the transcription of the CAT gene in transfected T cells , but it has a surprising inhibitory effect in transfected RBL cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
This inhibitory effect is only seen when the fragment is inserted 5 of the CAT gene and in the forward orientation .
The inhibitory effect is not seen when the insert is placed in the reverse orientation ( data not shown ) .
One possibility is that binding of basophil-specific nuclear factors to this region interferes nonspecifically with the functioning of the SV40 promoter .
Another possibility is that this region contains a basophil-specific negative element ( see below ) .
In any case , the negative effect of this fragment is nullified when the downstream sequence of the homologous promoter is present .
In addition , the disparate effects observed promoter region is highlighted in boldface .

of three separate transfections , each performed in duplicate .
efficiently by using unlabeled -445/-180 ( lanes 4 , 9 , and 14 ) or ~366/-290 fragments ( lanes 5 , 10 , and 15 ) but not by unrelated ones ( lanes 3 , 6 , 8 , 11 , and 13 ) .
Therefore , nuclear factors binding specifically to the -445/-264 region are present in these cells .
Furthermore , the different patterns obtained with nuclear extracts from RBL cells and from Jurkat or CEM-CM-3 cells suggest that the factors binding this region are different in T cells and basophils .
We also tested the binding capacity of the -445/-180 fragment ( not shown ) .
We observed no specific binding with a nuclear extract from HeLa cells but found virtually the same patterns of retarded bands with nuclear extracts from Jurkat , CEM-CM-3 , and RBL cells as those shown in Fig .
4 .
This suggests that the -264/-180 region does not participate in the binding of specific nuclear factors .
The -366/-290 Region Binds to Nuclear Factors That Are Different in Basophils and T Cells-Since the ~366/-290 fragment is an efficient inhibitor of the binding of nuclear factors to the -445/-264 region , we decided to use the radiolabeled -366/-290 fragment itself in binding studies ( Fig .
5A ) .
As expected , the patterns of retarded bands are different when the binding is performed in the presence of poly ( dI-dC ) or of poly ( dG-dC ) ( 36 , 37 ) .
Regardless of the conditions , the patterns of retarded bands are also different in T cells ( Jurkat and CEM-CM-3 ) and basophils ( RBL-2H3 and KUS812 ) .
These results are consistent with those obtained with the larger -445/-264 fragment , suggesting once again that the nuclear factors interacting with this region are different in basophils and T cells .

stranded oligonucleotides to inhibit specific binding to the -366/-290 element in RBL-2H3 cells ( Fig .
5B ) and in CEM-CM-3 cells ( Fig .
5C ) .
Two major bands in RBL cells and one major band in CEM-CM-3 cells are detected in the presence of the unlabeled NF-kB and AP-1 ( lanes 12 and 13 ) and are therefore considered to be specific .
These bands are not observed following competition with the homologous cold fragment ( lane 9 ) but are observed following competition with the -384/-365 oligonucleotide , whose sequence is located 5 of the relevant sequence ( lane 3 ) .
The -364/-345 oligonucleotide is inhibitory in RBL cells and may have a slight inhibitory effect in CEM-CM-3 cells ( lane 4 ) .
Since a Lyf-1 motif is present in the -364/-345 region , Lyf-binding factors already known to be present in various B and T lymphocytes could potentially explain the hematopoietic specificity of the promoter .
However , the surprising finding that the -284/-260 ( lane 8 ) and -50/+26 ( lane 10 ) oligonucleotides also inhibit binding in RBL cells but not in CEM-CM-3 cells led us to speculate that a sequence other than the Lyf-1 motif might also be involved in the binding .
Indeed , sequence comparison between these two oligonucleotides and the -366/-290 element reveals a common motif if one allows for two mismatches .
This motif is not found anywhere else in the 2.4 kilobases of the 5 ' region .
The sequence GCACTCCAGC is found at -355 right after the Lyf-1 motif , the sequence GatCTCCAGC is found at -15 , and the complementary sequence to cCACTCCAcC is found at -277 .
Therefore , it is conceivable that the presence of this common motif explains the inhibitory effect of the -284/ -260 and -50/+26 oligonucleotides in RBL cells .

tempting to speculate that the same basophil-specific factors interact with these three motifs .
This could explain why the -445/-264 fragment has a different activity when placed in front of a heterologous promoter ( see above ) .
Obviously , further characterization of the motif and of possible binding factors needs to be done .
Detection of Two Adjacent Regulatory Elements in the -445/ -264 Region-To analyze further the differential function of the -445/-264 fragment in basophils and T cells , we studied additional deletion constructs ( Fig .
6 ) .
Removing the region between -365 and -264 results in an 89 % increase in CAT activity in basophils when compared with the complete -445/ +26 region .

CAT activities were analyzed as in Fig .

The activities corresponding to the -2382 and to the -445 CAT construct were considered as 1 and 100 , respectively .

The differences of CAT activity between the -445 and the -445 gap ( -365/-264 ) CAT on the one hand , and between the -445 and -366 CAT constructs on the other hand are both highly significant in RBL-2H3 cells ( p < 0.01 ) .

Alignment of the cis-acting regulatory elements ( 2 ) with the primate-specific Alu consensus sequence ( IF ) .
The adjacent cis-acting regulatory elements of the y chain gene are underlined .
The consensus Alu sequence corresponds to the primate-specific Alu consensus sequence ( 41 ) .
The stretch of consecutive adenines is typical of the 3 ' portion of Alu sequences , although the number of these adenines is variable .
Here only 18 out of the 23 adenines found in the y chain gene are shown .
Double dots indicate identical nucleotides , and dashes correspond to gaps or deletions .
in T cells .
Therefore the -365/-264 element is a negative regulator in basophils but not in T cells .
Deletion of the -445/-366 region abolishes the CAT activity in RBL cells but yield only a 40 % reduction in CEM-CM-3 cells .
Indeed in CEM-CM-8 cells , a further deletion of the ~-365/-295 region is required to reduce the CAT activity to basal level ( see Fig .
2 ) .
These results indicate that the -445/ -366 element is a positive element in both basophils and T cells and that the -365/-264 element contains an activator in T cells but not in basophils .
The Two cis- Acting Regulatory Elements Are Part of an Alu Repeat-As mentioned above , the 5 sequence of the y chain gene contains two typical Alu repeats ( Fig .
1 ) .
Comparison of the sequence containing the two cis-acting regulatory elements ( ~445/-366 and -365/-264 elements ) with Alu consensus sequences shows that the regulatory elements are within the sequence of Alu repeats .
Among all subfamilies of Alu sequences ( 41 ) , the best alignment was with the primate-specific Alu consensus sequence .
We found that about 90 % of the nucleotides are identical between the two sequences ( Fig .
7 ) .
There are examples of Alu sequences containing negative regulatory elements ( 42 , 43 ) , but we are not aware of any example of positive regulatory elements containing Alu se-quences .
Clearly the entire ( -445/-366 ) -positive element is part of the Alu repeat .
Most of the other element ( -365/ -264 ) overlaps also with the Alu consensus sequence , but we can not exclude that the sequence from -296 to -264 , which is not part of the Alu repeat , is critical for its activity .
However , our binding studies suggest that the active region of the ( -365/-264 ) element is between -365 and -290 and is within the Alu repeat .
In conclusion , we have shown that the transcription of the FceRI-y chain gene is regulated by positive and negative cis-acting elements .
These elements are part of an Alu repeat , are only active in hematopoietic cells , and are recognized by DNA-binding proteins in a cell type-specific manner .
