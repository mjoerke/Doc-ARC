In this paper , we studied the molecular consequences of PF treatment during lymphocyte activation .
We found that in T cells , anti-CD3-induced c-Rel expression was blocked by PF , whereas the induction of other NF- « B family members was not significantly affected .
However , induction of NF-AT , which has the same signaling requirements as c-Rel induction , was not inhibited by PF .
Among genes that respond to these transcription factors , IL-2 mRNA induction was suppressed by PF , whereas IL-2Ra « chain mRNA induction was not affected .
These observations implicated c-Rel as an IL-2 promoter factor , for which experimental support was obtained from transient transfection experiments .
In contrast with the observation in T cells , c-Rel induction was not blocked by PF in B cells .
The greater selectivity of PF , compared with FK506 , at both the molecular and cellular levels may prove advantageous in manipulating T cell responses in vivo .
Introduction Lymphocyte activation via the antigen receptors results in clonal expansion and differentiation that is critical for subsequent immune responses .
Signals initiated at the plasma membrane culminate in the induction of transcription factors that reprogram cellular gene expression .
The induction patterns of two factors , NF-AT and c-Rel , correlate most closely with proliferation of B and T cells , because both proteins are induced only in response to the `` complete '' proliferative signal provided by the combined action of phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore , such as ionomycin ( Utz et al. , 1988 ; Venkataraman et al. , 1995 ) .
Their importance in lymphocyte function is further highlighted by the observation that induction of both factors is suppressed by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 ( Emme !
et al. , 1989 ; Venkataraman et al. , 1995 ) .
Moreover , lymphocyte proliferation in response to antigen receptor signals was shown to be severely inhibited in c-Rel-deficient mice ( Kontgen et al. , 1995 ) .
Therefore , it is likely that drugs affecting c-Rel and NF-AT induction will provide a means of regulating lymphocyte activation for therapeutic purposes .
Pentoxifylline ( PF ) is a vasoactive drug that is widely used in the clinic as an anti-inflammatory and for the treatment of endotoxin shock .
Although its efficacy has been attributed primarily to the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa ) production by monocytes and macro-phages ( Streiter et al. , 1988 ) , it is clear that PF affects diverse cell types .
For example , effects have been noted on endothelial cells ( Kovach et al. , 1994 ; Tozawa et al. , 1995 ) , smooth muscle cells ( Bellas et al. , 1995 ) , fibrosarcoma cell lines ( Takahashi et al. , 1994 ) , neuroblastoma cells ( Yang et al. , 1995 ) , embryonic kidney cells ( Biswas et al. , 19933 ) , and lymphocytes ( Biswas et al. , 1993b ; Tozawa et al. , 1995 ) .
The known effects on lymphocytes are briefly described below .
Injection of anti-CD3 antibodies in vivo has been shown to induce TNFa as well as soluble TNF receptors .
PF reduced systemic TNFa and p75 TNF receptor levels , suggesting that it interfered with the anti-CD3 activation pathways ( Bemelmans et al. , 1994 ) .
Furthermore , in two rodent autoimmune models , PF conferred significant protection against disease progression .
Immunization with myelin basic protein induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats , which is characterized by loss of weight and paralysis of hind legs .
These disease symptoms were almost completely abolished by PF administration ( Rott et al. , 1993 ) .
Similarly , mercuric chloride induced arthritis in rats , which is a model of a Th2-type T cell disease , was also significantly decreased by PF ( Kiley et al. , 1995 ) .
These observations not only suggest that PF may be an excellent therapeutic agent to control aberrant T cell responses , but also indicate that PF may have significant immunomodulatory effects when administered for other reasons .
Because little is known about the signaling pathways affected by PF , we were prompted to initiate a systematic analysis of the molecular consequences of PF treatment .
Our interest in PF originated from a proposed connection between NF-kB and this drug in various cell types .
In early studies , activation of the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) in 293 embryonic kidney cells was shown to be diminished by nontoxic doses of PF ( Biswas et al. , 19933 ) .
Because induced transcriptional activity of the HIV LTR depends on two NF- « B-binding sites in the enhancer region , these observations suggested that NF-B-dependent transcription was a target of PF .
Biswas et al .
( 1993b ) extended their analysis to Jurkat cells , where a 50 % decrease in DNA binding was seen when the cells were stimulated with phorbol ester in the presence of PF .
More recently , Bellas et al .
( 1995 ) reported that smooth muscle cells from bovine aorta contained constitutive nuclear DNA-binding NF- « B , which was reflected in transcriptional activity of a transfected c-myc promoter-directed reporter gene .
Immunity 166 Treatment of these cells with PF decreased c-myc promoter activity approximately 2-fold .
Although NF-kB levels were not directly assessed , these results were consistent with the interpretation that decreased c-myc promoter activity may be due to reduction of NF- « B by PF .
Finally , PF was shown to block the binding of human cancer cells to vascular endothelial cells ( Tozawa et al. , 1995 ) .
This interaction is mediated by several endothelial cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , and E-selectin whose expression is believed to be regulated by NF-kB proteins ( Ledebur and Parks , 1995 ; Montgomery et al. , 1991 ; Neish et al. , 1992 ; Schindler and Baichwal , 1994 ) .
In this report we examined the effects of PF on lymphocyte activation .
In T cells we found that c-Rel induction , which requires the dual signal of phorbol ester and ionomycin or anti-CD3 treatment , was suppressed by PF .
This effect was not a common feature of all Rel family members because induction of NF- « B ( p50/p65 heterodimer ) was variably affected , and Rel B was not affected at all by this drug .
In its effects on NF-kB family proteins , we found PF treatment to be indistinguishable from our earlier analysis of the immunosuppressive drug FK506 ( Venkataraman et al. , 1995 ) .
However , in contrast with cyclosporin A or FK506 , PF treatment did not suppress NF-AT induction or NF-AT-dependent transcription activation in activated T cells .
Because c-Rel induction , like NF-AT , requires a calcineurin-dependent step , these observations suggest that PF affects c-Rel induction downstream of calcineurin .
Suppression of some , but not all , inducible transcription factors was reflected in inhibition of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene expression , but not interleukin-2 receptor « chain ( IL-2Ra ) gene induction .
Interestingly , c-Rel induction in B cells activated by phorbol ester and ionomycin was not blocked by PF , suggesting that PF may differentially affect B and T cell responses .

Activation by anti-CD3 cross-linking or by treatment with phorbol ester and ionomycin ( data not shown ) strongly induced NF-kB DNA binding activity ( Figure 1A , lane 2 ) .
We have previously shown by antibody supershifts that this induced complex contains both p65 ( Rel A ) and c-Rel proteins ( Venkataraman et al. , 1996 ) .
However , it is difficult to estimate accurately the proportion of the available nuclear DNA binding activity that is either the p50/p65 or p50/c-Rel heterodim-ers , because these proteins have different affinities for the probe DNA and the antisera recognize the DNA-bound proteins with different efficiencies .
In the presence of either PF ( Figure 1A , lane 3 ) or the immunosuppressive drug FK506 ( lane 4 ) , induction of proteins binding to this kB DNA probe was significantly reduced .
In the experiments described above , PF and FK506 affected the induction of NF-kB proteins similarly .
To extend these observations , we examined the effect of PF on two other well-characterized activated T cell factors .
Unlike NF-kB , induction of NF-AT by anti-CD3 ( Figure 1B , lane 2 ) was not affected by PF ( lane 3 ) .
As expected , NF-AT induction was abolished by FK506 ( Figure 1B , lane 4 ) .
Finally , neither PF nor FK506 had any effect on the induction of AP-1 in these cells ( Figure 1C ) .
In these assays , treatment of cells with FK506 or PF alone ( in the absence of cell stimulation ) had no effect on the constitutive levels of NF-kB or NF-AT protein ( data not shown ) .
These observations indicate that PF and FK506 differentially affect inducible nuclear factors in activated D5h3 cells ; FK506 blocks c-Rel and NF-AT induction , Figure 1 .
Comparison of the Effects of PF and FK506 on Activation of Inducible Transcription Factors in D5h3 T Cells { A ) Analysis of NF- « B DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared from D5h3 cells treated as indicated above the lanes .
Anti-CD3 refers to activation of cells by plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies for 4 hr .
Drugs were added to the cells 10 min prior to cell activation .
EMSA analysis was carried out using a palindromic NF- « B-binding site from the major histocompatibility complex class | gene pro-moter ; this sequence is referred to as the H2K probe .
The arrow indicates the position of the major inducible NF-kB complex , which contains both p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel heterodimers .
The lower , unlabeled band contains p50/p50 homodimers .
{ B ) Analysis of NF-AT DNA binding activity in D5h3 nuclear extracts .
NF-AT probe is an oligonucleotide containing the NF-AT-binding site from the murine IL-2 gene promoter .
The upper arrow ( labeled NF-AT ) is the major inducible complex that contains both the NF-AT , , cytoplasmic component and the AP-1 component .
The lower arrow ( labeled NF-AT , ) contains only the preexisting NF-AT subunits without the AP-1 components .
{ C ) Analysis of AP-1 binding activity in D5h3 nuclear extracts .
An oligonucleotide - ( TCGACCCACATTAGCATGACTCATTIGTTTCTGC ) containing the AP-1 site from the metallothioenine gene promoter was used in EMSA with extracts derived from D5h3 cells treated in various ways .
The major inducible complex is labeled as AP-1 to the right of the gel .
The identity of the slower mobility complex present equally in all lanes is presently unknown .

Effect of PF and FK506 on individual Rel Family Proteins Analysis of c-Rel induction in D5h3 cells treated as indicated above the lanes .
Cell treatments are summarized in the legend of Figure 1 .
Nuclear ( N ) and cytoplasmic ( C ) extracts ( 6 g ) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose paper , and probed using an anti-c-Rel antiserum ( A ) or an anti-Rel B antiserum ( B ) .

Induction of specific Rel family members was further monitored by immunoblotting .
c-Rel expression was induced in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus by anti-CD3 treatment ( Figure 2A , lanes 3 and 4 ) and was abrogated by both PF and FK506 ( lanes 5-8 ) .
In contrast , Rel B expression in the nucleus was not significantly affected by activation , either in the presence or absence of the drugs ( Figure 2B ) .
Interestingly , activation of these cells increased total cellular Rel B expression , but most of the protein remained in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Figure 2B , lanes 4 , 6 , and 8 ) , suggesting that Rel B nuclear translocation required additional signals .
We conclude that NF- « B and c-Rel induction in activated D5h3 cells is inhibited by PF , whereas Rel B induction is not affected .
Thus , PF blocks the induction of a subset of Rel family members .
Properties of NF-AT in PF-Treated D5h3 Cells To investigate further the apparent lack of effect of PF on NF-AT induction in these cells , we examined the subunit composition and transcription activation properties of NF-AT in PF-treated cells .
In EMSA , most of the anti-CD3 induced NF-AT in the presence or absence of PF was supershifted with antisera directed against NF-AT , ( Figure 3A , compare lanes 2 and 5 with lanes 1 and 4 ) .
Both upper and lower NF-AT complexes were significantly diminished , giving rise to two new bands whose positions are indicated by the arrows on the side of the gel ( Figure 3A ) .
Consistent with the bulk of the activity being NF-AT , derived , the NF-AT , antisera did not yield significant supershifted complexes ( Figure 3A , compare lanes 3 and 6 with lanes 1 and 4 ) .
Longer exposures of these gels revealed weak supershift bands that were not significantly different in the two sets of extracts ( data not shown ) .
It is likely that the residual slower migrating complex left at the position of the NF-AT-DNA complex after anti-NF-AT , treatment represents NF-AT ; containing induced proteins .
Comparison of this complex in lanes 2 and 5 confirmed that the levels of NF-AT ; were also not affected by PF treatment .
The transcription activation properties of NF-AT were examined by transient transfection assays using reporter plasmids containing multimerized NF-AT-binding sites .
Activity of the reporter in D5h3 cells was significantly induced by treatment of the cells with phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore ( Figure 3B , first two bars ) , but not after treatment with phorbol ester alone ( data not shown ) , as expected based on the known properties of NF-AT .
Induced activity was efficiently suppressed by FK506 ; however , treatment of cells with PF resulted in somewhat higher levels of transcription from this vector ( Figure 3B , last two bars ) .
We reproducibly observed increased reporter activity in cells treated with PF .
Although the reason for this is not clear at present , one possibility is that other DNA-binding proteins that are suppressed by PF may compete with NF-AT for binding to the NF-AT site , thus decreasing the effective transcription activation potential of NF-AT in such assays .
Inhibition of IL-2 Gene Induction by PF in D5h3 Cells Several genes are activated in response to T cell stimulation ( Ullman etal. , 1990 ) .
Among these , the genes encoding IL-2 and IL-2Re play a critical role in subsequent T cell proliferation and clonal expansion .
The promoters of both genes are regulated by a complex array of transcription factors , some of which are induced in activated cells and others of which are constitutively expressed .
NF-AT was first identified as an inducible factor that bound to the IL-2 promoter , and it is well established that it is a key component required for IL-2 expression ( Emmel et al. , 1989 ; Flanagan et al. , 1991 ; Utz et al. , 1988 ) .
NF- « B-binding sites have been identified in both the IL-2Ra ( Cross et al. , 1989 ; Leung and Nabel , 1988 ; Lowenthal et al. , 1989 ; Ruben et al. , 1988 ) and IL-2 pro-moters .
Mutation of the NF- « B site in the IL-2R « promoter abolishes inducible promoter activity , indicating that inducible kB-binding proteins are required for IL-2Ra expression .
The role of kB proteins in the regulation of IL-2 is less clear .
Of the two kB elements identified in the IL-2 promoter , one has been implicated in the costimulatory response mediated via CD28 ( Fraser et al. , 1991 ; Verweij et al. , 1991 ) and the second in the activation of the promoter by transactivator ( tax ) of type 1 human T lymphotropic virus ( HTLV-1 ) ( Ruben et al. , 1988 ) .
Neither site had been considered crucial for IL-2 induction by the T cell receptor ; however , a recent study found that the distal NF- « B-binding site was important for IL-2 induction by phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) plus phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( Hughes and Pober , 1996 ) .

Characterization of Inducible NF-AT Activity in Cells Treated with PF { A ) Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays .
Standard in vitro binding reactions were carried out using the NF-AT probe for 15 min at room temperature , followed by addition of normal rabbit serum ( NRS ) , anti-NF-AT antiserum ( NF-AT , } , and anti-NF-AT ; monoclonal antibody 7A6 ( NF-AT , ) to the reactions and further incubation for 1 hr on ice .
Subsequent analysis by nondenaturing electrophoresis was as usual for EMSA .
Nuclear extracts analyzed were obtained from D5h3 cells activated by plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies for 4 hr in the absence { lanes 1-3 ) or presence of PF ( lanes 4-6 ) .
The two major bands seen PIPE in lane 1 represent the complete NF-AT complex ( including AP-1 ; upper band ) and the , , ; complex alone ( lower band ) .

{ B ) Transcription activation properties of NF-AT .
A CAT reporter plasmid containing multimerized NF-AT-binding sites upstream of a truncated c-fos gene promoter ( Venkataraman et al. , 1995 ) was transiently transfected into D5h3 cells .
After 24 hr , cells were left untreated or were treated with phorbol ester plus ionomycin alone ( P+ ! )
or in the presence of PF { labeled P+I+F ) or FK506 ( labeled P+I+FK ) .
Cells were harvested 4 hr after treatment , and CAT enzyme levels in equal amounts of whole-cell extracts were determined by ELISA .
Results shown are derived from two sets of transfections carried out in duplicate .
activation , and the possible involvement of NF- « B proteins for expression , we examined the effects of PF on the induction of IL-2 and IL-2Re mRNA .
Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from DS5h3 cells showed that both IL-2Re and IL-2 mRNAs were induced with anti-CD3 treatment ( Figures 4A and 4B ) .
When the cells were activated in the presence of PF , we observed a partial suppression of IL-2R « mRNA levels ( Figure 4A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .

Analysis of Inducible Gene Expression in D5h3 Cells Total RNA isolated from cells ( 10 ug ) treated as indicated was fractionated through formaldehyde-containing agarose gels , transferred to nitrocellulose filters , and hybridized to radioactive probes derived from IL-2Ra ( A ) and IL-2 ( B ) .
Expression of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ( C ) was used as a control for RNA loading .
( Figure 4C ) , may account for most of the difference in IL-2Ra mRNA expression .
Thus , IL-2R « mRNA expression was not significantly affected by PF , despite the reduction of NF- « B DNA binding activity .
A possible explanation may be that the lower levels of NF- « B are sufficient for IL-2Ra « induction or , alternatively , that a Rel protein with low DNA binding affinity ( such as a p65 homodimer ) may be the functional IL-2Ra « promoter factor .
In contrast , IL-2 mRNA induction was completely suppressed by PF ( Figure 4B ) , despite the negligible effect of this drug on NF-AT induction and transcription activation by NF-AT .
These observations indicate that NF-AT , and by extrapolation AP-1 proteins , are not sufficient for IL-2 expression and that other inducible factors are required to synergize with NF-AT to activate this promoter .
Based on the observed inhibition of Rel proteins by PF , it is likely that NF- « B proteins may be the missing components necessary for IL-2 gene induction .
PF Inhibits c-Rel and IL-2 Induction in Splenic T Cells To rule out the possibility that the observations described above were due to the transformed nature of D5h3 cells , we examined the effects of PF on the activation of primary , untransformed T cells .
Concanavalin A ( ConA ) blasts of splenic cells were activated by anti-CD3 cross-linking in the presence or absence of PF and FK506 and assayed by EMSA , immunoblotting and Northern blots .
NF-kB DNA binding was strongly induced by anti-CD3 stimulation ( Figure 5A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The induced nucleoprotein complex contained both p65 and c-Rel ( probably in p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel heter-odimeric forms ) , as ascertained by supershift analysis with anti-p65 as well as anti-c-Rel antibody ( data not shown ) .
In contrast with the observation in D5h3 cells , NF-kB binding was not inhibited when the cells were activated in the presence of PF ( Figure 5A , lane 3 ) ; however , inclusion of FK506 reduced NF- « B induction significantly ( Figure 5A , lane 4 ) .

Specifically , NF-AT induction ( Figure 5B , lanes 1 and 2 ) was not blocked by PF ( lane 3 ) , but was totally abrogated by FK506 ( lane 4 ) .
We conclude that PF does not suppress either NF-kB or NF-AT induction in primary T cells , whereas FK506 suppresses both inducible factors .
Because most of the DNA binding NF- « B activity observed involves the p50/p65 heterodimer , we surmise that the lack of an effect of PF on NF- « B induction measured by EMSA indicates that p50/p65 heterodimer induction is unaffected by this drug .
However , as shown below , c-Rel induction by anti-CD3 was inhibited by PF .
We assayed specific Rel family members by immunoblotting .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from cells treated in various ways were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and probed with anti-c-Rel or anti-Rel B antisera .
Because equal amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were used , the relative distribution of the proteins in the nucleus is overestimated 3- to 4-fold .
In untreated T cells , c-Rel protein was mostly restricted to the cytoplasmic fraction ( Figure 5C , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Anti-CD3 treatment resulted in increased c-Rel expression in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( Figure 5C , lanes 3 and 4 ) , and the induction was blocked by both PF and FK506 ( lanes 5-8 ) .
Rel B expression was not significantly affected by PF ( data not shown ) , as seen above in D5h3 cells .
We conclude that induction of certain Rel proteins such as c-Rel , but not other Rel proteins such as NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) or Rel B , is blocked by PF in untransformed T cells .
Thus , both PF and FK506 block c-Rel induction , but in addition FK506 blocks NF- « B and NF-AT induction as well .
To examine the effects of PF on inducible T cell genes , Anti-CD3+PF Ae Figure 5 .

Anti-CD3+FK506 < - NF-AT < < 4- NF-ATp we assayed IL-2 and IL-2R « e mRNA expression by Northern blotting .
Both genes were strongly induced by anti-CD3 treatment ( Figures 6A and 6B , lanes 1 and 2 ) , and neither drug affected IL-2Ra « expression .
Previously , it has been noted that IL-2Ra « expression decreased approximately 2-fold in peripheral human mononuclear cells activated for 3 days with PHA in the presence of PF .
This small quantitative difference from our results could be due to the extended period of stimulation used in that study , the cell type and activation agent used , or a combination of these parameters .
We conclude that PF does not significantly affect IL-2R « mRNA induction .
However , IL-2 expression was inhibited by both PF and FK506 ( Figure 6A , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
These observations are similar to those in D5h3 cells and show that the IL-2 gene is suppressed by PF , even though this drug does not affect either NF- « B or NF-AT induction .
Based on the suppression of c-Rel induction by PF and the possible involvement of a kB element in IL-2 gene induction , we suggest that c-Rel may be a critical component of the IL-2 promoter .
c-Rel and NF-AT , , Activate the IL-2 Promoter To test whether the c-Rel gene product could activate the IL-2 gene promoter , we carried out the following transfection experiments .
A reporter plasmid containing the 600 bp complete IL-2 promoter fragment ( Hughes and Pober , 1996 ) was cotransfected along with expression vectors for c-Rel ( Pierce et al. , 1995 ) and NF-AT ; ( Northrop et al. , 1994 ) into 293 ( nonlymphoid ) cells , and promoter activity was measured using a luciferase assay .

Expression of Inducible Genes in Splenic T Cells Total RNA isolated from the cells ( 10 pg ) treated as indicated was fractionated through formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters , which were hybridized to radioactive probes derived from IL-2 ( A ) and IL-2R « ( B ) .
Equivalent RNA loading was determined by assaying GAPDH expression ( C ) .
these cells in the absence of cotransfected transactivators ( Figure 7 ) .
Neither the expression of c-Rel nor NF-AT alone activated the IL-2 promoter significantly under these experimental conditions ( Figure 7 , first three bars ) .
However , coexpression of both c-Rel and NF-AT ; together resulted in synergistic transactivation of the IL-2 promoter ( Figure 7 , fourth bar ) , strengthening our hypothesis that c-Rel is a functional IL-2 promoter factor .
While carrying out these studies , we noticed that the IL-2 promoter was also transactivated to low levels with either c-Rel or NF-AT ; when these factors were expressed individually at higher levels , and coexpression resulted in transcriptional synergy similar to the results shown in Figure 7 ( data not shown ) .
An additional point needs to be clarified .
Because it was recently shown that both NF-AT , and NF-AT , activated a cotransfected IL-2 promoter to equivalent levels ( Timmerman et al. , 1996 ) , we have not repeated the studies described here with NF-AT , .
Our observations provide direct evidence for functional cooperation between NF-AT and Rel proteins , and implicate both factors in the regulation of IL-2 gene expression .
PF Does Not Inhibit c-Rel Induction in B Cells Activated B and T cells share many common features .
For example , both cell types require the dual signal provided by phorbol ester and ionomycin to proliferate ; both cell types induce NF-AT and c-Rel proteins only in response to this `` complete '' proliferative signal ( Venkataraman et al. , 1994 , 1995 ) ; and immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506 have similar 107 8 [ 3 2 B PS 64 ® y £ 2 ® & - 24 0 - NF-ATe c-Rel _ NF-ATc+c-Rel Figure 7 .
Transactivation of IL-2 Promoter by c-Rel and NF-AT A luciferase reporter plasmid containing the wild-type human IL-2 gene promoter was cotransfected into 293 human embryonic kidney cells together with expression vectors for c-Rel and NF-AT , , as indicated .
Cell extracts prepared 40 hr after transfection were assayed for luciferase expression .
Activity of the reporter plasmid is shown normalized to that seen in the absence of cotransfected transactivators ( first bar ) .
The results shown are derived from two sets of transfections carried out in duplicate .
effects on both cell types .
We therefore investigated whether PF would have the same effect on B cells as we observed in T cells .
Bal 17 B lymphoma cells were activated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence or absence of PF and assayed for NF- « B expression by EMSA and immunoblotting .
These cells contain constitutive nuclear NF- « B that is detectable by EMSA in uninduced cells ( Figure 8A , lane 1 ) .
Increased NF- « B was evident after stimulation with phorbol ester and ionomycin ( Figure 8A , lane 2 ) , which was not suppressed in the presence of either PF or FK506 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
A lack of sensitivity to PF is reminiscent of our observation in primary T cells ; however , insensitivity to FK506 is clearly different from the effects in T cells .
Surprisingly , unlike T cells , PF did not affect c-Rel induction in Bal 17 B cells ( Figure 8B ) .
Indeed , in several independent experiments we noted that the total cellular levels of c-Rel ( cytoplasmic plus nuclear ) were detectably enhanced in PF-treated cells ( for example in Figure 8B compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The lack of an effect of PF on c-Rel induction in B cells was further confirmed in primary splenic B cells activated with either phorbol ester plus ionomycin or anti-immunoglobulin ( data not shown ) .
Phorbol ester and ionomycin treatment strongly induced nuclear Rel B expression ( Figure 8C , lanes 2 and 4 ) , which was unaffected by either PF or FK506 ( lanes 6 and 8 ) .
Interestingly , whereas most of the newly expressed Rel B in activated T cells was located in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Figure 2B ) , most of the Rel B in activated B cells was found in the nuclear fraction .
These observations suggest that nuclear translocation of Rel B may be differently regulated in B and T cells .
We conclude that PF suppresses c-Rel induction in T cells , but not in B cells .

Discussion In this report we describe the effects of the drug PF on lymphocyte activation .
In T cells , three general features were noted .
First , PF suppressed the induction of c-Rel protein in response to stimulation via the T cell receptor or its pharmacologic equivalent , phorbol ester and ionomycin .
Its effect on the other Rel family proteins was more variable , with induction of Rel B being virtually unaffected and the induction of NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) depending on the cells examined .
Specifically , NF- « B induction was unimpaired in PF-treated splenic T cells , but significantly reduced in D5h3 hybridoma cells .
It is unlikely that the effect in D5h3 cells was solely due to its transformed nature , because anti-CD3-induced NF-kB was also suppressed in the Th1 clone AEZ ( W. W. , T. L. Rothstein , and R. S. , unpublished data ) .
Second , induction of NF-AT or AP-1 was not suppressed by PF .
We previously showed that c-Rel and NF-AT shared indistinguishable activation characteristics , both requiring the dual signal of phorbol ester plus ionomycin , both requiring new protein synthesis , and both proteins being inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug FK506 .
Our present findings show that the activation of these two key regulatory proteins can be distinguished by PF .
Furthermore , PF must affect the c-Rel activation pathway downstream of calcineurin , because continued NF-AT induction suggests that calcineurin activation is unaffected by this drug .
Third , induction of IL-2 gene , but not the IL-2Re gene , was blocked by PF .
In contrast with the observations in T cells , we found that c-Rel induction was not blocked by PF in B cells .
Thus , the greater specificity of PF compared with FK506 is reflected both at the molecular level ( suppression of N < RelB C MCAI 5 6 7 8 Figure 8 .
Effect of PF on the Induction of Rel Family Proteins in Bal 17 B Cells { A ) Analysis of NF-kB DNA binding .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from Bal 17 B lymphoma cells activated with phorbol ester and N ionomycin , in the presence or absence of FK506 or PF , as indicated above the lanes .
The H2K probe was used for EMSA ; the arrow indicates the position of the inducible NF-kB-DNA complex .
Lane 1 shows the constitutive nuclear NF- « B activity that is characteristic of mature B cells .
{ B and C ) Expression of c-Rel and Rel B proteins .
Nuclear ( N ) or cytoplasmic ( C ) extracts { 6 ug ) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and probed with anti-c-Rel or anti-Rel B antiserum .
Positions of c-Rel and Rel B proteins are indicated by the arrows .
P+I+PF only c-Rel , and not NF-AT , in T cells ) and at the cellular level ( c-Rel suppression occurs in T cells , but not in B cells ) .
Although the mechanistic basis for the differential effect of PF on B and T cells is not yet understood , two alternative models could account for these observa-tions .
First , c-Rel may be induced by different pathways in B and T cells , with only the T cell pathway being sensitive to PF .
Alternatively , the induction pathway may be the same in both cell types , but B cells may have compensatory mechanisms to circumvent the block by PF .
Several lines of evidence make us favor the second model .
First , the requirements for c-Rel induction are similar in both cell types ( Venkataraman et al. , 1996 ) , suggesting a common mechanism for the induction of this gene .
Second , with respect to NF-kB proteins , the physiology of B and T cells differ in at least three ways : B cells contain constitutively nuclear NF- « B , whereas T cells do not ; B cells rapidly translocate cytoplasmic c-Rel , whereas T cells do not ( Venkataraman et al. , 1996 ) ; and Rel B translocation to the nucleus is more efficient in B cells compared with T cells ( see Figures 2B and 7C ) .
Regardless of the mechanism , these observations suggest that PF may be used to manipulate T cell responses selectively in vivo .
Our studies have other interesting implications .
We chose to analyze IL-2 and IL-2Ra « gene expression to get an idea of the consequences of transcription factor dysregulation by PF in activated T cells .
In both transformed and untransformed T cells , we found that IL-2Ra expression was essentially unaffected , whereas IL-2 gene induction was abolished .
The regulatory sequence that governs IL-2R « induction depends primarily on NF- « B and serum response factor-binding sites .
We have previously shown that this inducible enhancer can be synergistically transactivated by serum response factor together with either p65 or a p50/c-Rel heterodimer ( Pierce et al. , 1995 ) .
Because IL-2Ra Immunity 172 expression was not affected by PF whereas c-Relinduc-tion was diminished , we propose that c-Rel is not the major IL-2Ra kB site-binding protein in activated T cells .
Continued IL-2Ra gene induction even when NF-kB levels were low ( Figure 3 ) suggested that these low levels may be sufficient for gene induction or that strong transactivators with low binding affinities ( such as p65 homo-dimers , which would be difficult to detect in these binding assays ) may be directing IL-2Ra « gene expression .
Results with the IL-2 gene are exactly reversed : gene induction is suppressed independent of the levels of NF-kB .
Extensive analysis of the IL-2 promoter has identified three main categories of inducible protein-binding sites : NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-kB .
Because neither DNA binding nor transcriptional activation by NF-AT and AP-1 was affected by PF , and the effects on NF- « B were variable , the simplest interpretation of our observations is that the IL-2 promoter is a target of c-Rel .
Although it is possible that induced c-Rel activates other transcription factor genes that are the functional IL-2 promoter factors , the similar time course of IL-2 and c-Rel activation leads us to propose that c-Rel is the functional Rel protein that activates IL-2 transcription .
In support of this , we found that c-Rel acted synergistically with NF-AT ; to activate the IL-2 promoter in transient transfection assays in nonlymphoid cells .
However , it is not our intent to suggest that c-Rel and NF-AT are the only IL-2 promoter factors or that the complete activity of the promoter has been reconstituted in our experiments .
In addition , we note that the possibility that PF affects a previously unidentified IL-2 promoter factor can not be unequivocally ruled out .
Families of transcription factors often share similar DNA recognition sites ; consequently it has been difficult to identify gene targets of specific family members .
Our proposal that the IL-2 gene may be regulated primarily by c-Rel and the IL-2R « gene by p65 provides an intriguing insight into the division of labor among Rel family proteins during T cell activation .
Our results are also consistent with the activation phenotype of c-Rel-deficient animals ( Kontgen et al. , 1995 ) .
Kontgen et al .
showed that B and T lymphocytes from c-Rel-deficient mice did not proliferate in response to signals initiated at the respective antigen receptors .
In T cells , the effect was primarily due to lack of IL-2 synthesis , whereas IL-2Ra induction was not affected .
Our studies with normal mature T cells complement the analysis of c-Rel '~ animals and argue against the possibility that the lack of proliferation in c-Rel'~ animals is due to a developmental defect caused by the lack of c-Rel .
We do not mean to imply that Rel family members never compensate for each other .
It is possible that the endogenous IL-2Ra « promoter is also activated by c-Rel protein , as has been observed in transactivation assays .
However , in the absence of c-Rel , another Rel protein ( most probably p65 ) is clearly sufficient for gene induction .
That this is not the case for IL-2 suggests a more strict requirement for a specific Rel family protein for IL-2 promoter activity , presumably to coordinate interactions with other promoter factors .
Based on its chemical structure , PF is believed to function as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that raises intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels .
Although this may be true in some situations , several observations suggest that this may not be its only mode of action .
For example , PF can augment differentiation of a neuroblastoma cell line , but this activity was not mimicked by cAMP ( Yang et al. , 1995 ) ; PF did not cause a significant increase of intracellular cAMP in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells , whereas the combined action of PF plus prostanoids did elevate cAMP levels in the same cells ( Sinha et al. , 1995 ) ; in 702 pre-B cells , cAMP has been found to activate x light chain expression ( Shirakawa et al. , 1989 ) , whereas we found that PF inhibited LPS-mediated k expression ( W. W. , J. Durdik , S. R. , and R. S. , unpublished data ) .
Furthermore , in peripheral human T lymphocytes , the effects of PF were not blocked by HA1004 , an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( Rao et al. , 1991 ) .
Thus , the mechanism of PF action remains unclear .
It has been previously shown that cAMP and cAMP agonists such as prostaglandin E1 and E2 inhibit IL-2 gene induction in T cells .
The molecular mechanism of inhibition by cAMP has been investigated in EL-4 cells and found to correlate with NF-kB ( Chen and Rothenberg , 1994 ) and , in particular , the Rel A component of NF-kB ( Neuman et al. , 1995 ) .
However , as described above , we found that PF had variable effects on Rel A , but consistently inhibited c-Rel induction in T cells .
Based on these observations , we consider it likely that PF action on T cells is amore complex phenomenon than simply raising intracellular cAMP .
A possible relationship of PF to calcium mobilization ( Yang et al. , 1995 ) is particularly interesting because optimal c-Rel induction requires the dual signal of PMA plus ionomycin .
PF may therefore inhibit c-Rel induction by attenuating a component of the calcium response .
Experimental Procedures Cells and Cell Activation D5h3 ( T ) cells and Bal 17 ( B ) cells were grown as previously described ( Venkataraman et al. , 1996 ) .
Concanavalin A ( ConA ) blasts of splenic T cells were prepared by activating a single cell suspension of spleen cells with 2 ug/ml ConA ( Calbiochem ) in DMEM , 10 % FCS , penicillin , and streptomycin for 3 days .
IL-2 ( 10 U/ml ) was added to the cultures every 2 days .
After approximately 7 days , the cells were rested in the absence of ConA or IL-2 for 16 hr prior to activation .
For cell activation , phorbol ester ( Sigma ) and ionomycin ( Calbiochem ) were used at 50 ng/ml and 2 wM , respectively .
CD3 cross-linking was carried out using plate-bound antibody .
In brief , a solution of rabbit anti-hamster ( Cappel ) antibodies in PBS ( 100 pg/ml ) was placed in 6-well tissue culture dishes for 12 hr at 4°C .
The supernatant was removed , and the plates were washed three times with cold PBS to remove unbound antibody .
Prior to cell activation , anti-CD3 antibody was added to the cells at a concentration of 6 g/ml , followed by addition of cells at a density of 5 X 10° per milliliter in complete medium .
After activation , cells were scraped off the plates with a rubber policeman , washed three times with PBS ( 4°C ) , and used to prepare RNA or nuclear extracts .
For drug treatment , PF at 300 g/ml or FK506 at 2 nM was added to the cultures 10 min prior to activation .
PF concentration was chosen based on earlier studies that used this drug at doses of 150-900 pg/ml !
( Biswas et al. , 1993a , 1993b ; Rao et al. , 1991 ; Streiter et al. , 1988 ) .
In our own dose-response titrations , the observed effects were significantly reduced at 150 pg/ml and unchanged at higher ( 600 g/m ! )
drug concentrations .
Nuclear Extracts , EMSA , and Western Blots All procedures have been previously described ( Venkataraman et al. , 1996 ) .
Probes for EMSA were the H2K ( Mauxion et al. , 1991 ; Regulation of Rel Proteins in Lymphocytes Mauxion and Sen , 1989 ) kB sequence and the murine NF-AT sequence that we used previously ( Venkataraman et al. , 1994 ) .
For immunoblotting , anti-c-Rel antibodies ( SC 71 ; Santa Cruz Biotech-nology ) and anti-Rel B antibodies ( SC 226 % ; Santa Cruz Biotechnol-ogy ) were used at a 1:500 dilution .
Northern Blots Total cellular RNA was isolated using the ultraspec ( Biotecx Labora-tories , Houston , TX ) RNA isolation solution procedure , and 10 ug was fractionated through 1 % agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose filters .
Prehybridization was carried out for 30 min in 50 % deionized formamide , 5x SSPE , 5 % Denhardt 's solution , 0.5 % SDS , 100 ug/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42°C .
Probes { described below ) were radiolabeled by random priming and used at a concentration of 2 x 10° cpm per milliliter of hybridization buffer .
Probes Probes were as follows : IL-2 , a 900 bp Pst !
fragment was isolated from pIL-2-sense ( gift of Dr. B. Huber , Tufts University School of Medicine , Boston , MA } ; IL-2Ra , 1 kb EcoRl-Xbal fragment containing the murine IL-2Ra cDNA was isolated from pGEM-1-R8-1000Exb ( Miller et al. , 1985 ; gift of Dr. A. Rao , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA } ; GAPDH , a 750 Pstl-Kpnl fragment was isolated from pBSKII* rat GAPDH clone ( gift of Dr. M. Baron , Harvard University , Cambridge , MAJ } .
Transient Transfections D5h3 { T hybridoma } cells ( 5 X 10° ) were transfected with 10 ug of reporter plasmids using DEAE-dextran ( Nelsen et al. , 1990 ) .
At 24 hr posttransfection , cells were treated with phorbol ester , ionomycin , and PF as indicated for an additional 4 hr .
Cells were harvested and 50 mug of whole-cell extracts was assayed for CAT enzyme by ELISA ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
293 ( human embryonic kidney ) cells were transfected using calcium phosphate with a wild-type IL-2 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid ( Hughes and Pober , 1996 ) in the presence or absence of 2 ug of expression vectors for transactivators c-Rel and NF-AT ; { Northrop et al. , 1994 ; Venkataraman et al. , 1995 ) .
When no or only one transactivator was present , the total DNA was held constant at 6 g using an expression vector containing no insert .
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer 48 hr after transfection ( Analytic Luminescence Laboratory , Ann Arbor , MI ) , and 20 ug of extract was used for the luciferase assay .
Luciferase activity was normalized to that seen in the absence of cotransfected transactivator plasmids .
