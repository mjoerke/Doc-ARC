Accepted for publication 9 October 1997 477 Activation of nuclear factor xB in inflammatory bowel disease S Schreiber , S Nikolaus , J Hampe Abstract Background-Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is increased in the intestinal lamina propria of patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
Nuclear factor xB ( NFB ) controls transcription of inflammation genes .
On activation , NFB is rapidly released from its cytoplasmic inhibitor ( IxB ) , transmigrates into the nucleus , and binds to DNA response elements in gene promoter re-gions .
Aims-To investigate whether increased activation of NFxB is important in IBD and may be down-regulated by anti-inflammatory treatment .
Methods-Activation of NFxB was determined by western blot assessment and electrophoretic mobility shift assay in nuclear extracts of colonic biopsy samples as well as lamina propria mononuclear cells .
Results-Nuclear levels of NFB p65 are increased in lamina propria biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn 's disease in comparison with patients with ulcerative colitis and controls .
Increased activation of NFB was detected in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with active IBD .
Corticosteroids strongly inhibit intestinal NFxB activation in IBD in vivo and in vitro by stabilising the cytosolic inhibitor IxBa against activation induced degradation .
Conclusions-In both IBDs , but particularly Crohn 's disease , increased activation of NFxB may be involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response .
Inhibition of NFkB activation may represent a mechanism by which steroids exert an anti-inflammatory effect in IBD .
( Gut 1998 ; 42:477-484 ) Keywords : interleukin 18 ; inflammatory bowel disease ; intestinal immunity ; signal transduction ; steroids ; tumour necrosis factor a Recent studies have shown increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin ( IL ) 18 and tumour necrosis factor a ( INF-aq ) in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
Increased levels of TNF-a have also been reported in stools of children with active Crohn 's disease . ''
The increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal mucosa is thought to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation in IBD .
** However , the pivotal elements in the regulation of the increased inflammatory activity remain unclear .
Important candidates are transcription factors that bind to gene promoter regions and are involved in the regulation of inflammation gene transcription .
Nuclear factor xB ( NFxB ) was originally defined as a heterodimeric complex of two subunits , p65 and p50.° ° The NFxB family includes the proteins p50 and its precursor p105 ( NFxB1 ) , p52 and its precursor p100 ( NFxB2 ) , p65 ( RelA ) , c-Rel , and Rel B . ''
° Functionally active NFxB represents homo- or hetero-dimers of members of the Rel family of transcription factor proteins , which mostly include p65 as one of the molecules .
The main function of NFxB appears to be the transcriptional regulation of certain genes as a transactivating factor .
Binding of NFxB to specific DNA sequences located in gene promoter regions is a pivotal event in the regulation of transcriptional events by the factor . ''
° NFrB was originally defined by its ability to bind to a 10 bp oligonucleotide motif first identified in the enhancer region of the immunoglobulin x light chain gene .
Using labelled oligonucleotides resembling this binding sequence , NFxB can be assessed semmiquantitatively by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) . ''
The detection of specific DNA binding describes a crucial event in the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by NFxB , although further steps are necessary for the factor to exert control over inflammation gene transcription .
Most proteins of the NFxB family are consti-tutively present in the cytoplasm of mononuclear phagocytes .
In resting cells , they are bound to inactivating molecules such as inhibitor xB a ( IxBa ) or large NFxB precursors-for example , p105 .
`` ° A host of activating stimuli including lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and TNF-a induce site specific phosphorylation of IxBa and consecutive rapid dissociation of the complex accompanied by proteolytic degradation of IxBa . '' ''
The released NFxB proteins subsequently transmigrate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where they can augment transcription of specific genes in synergy with other pro-inflammatory transcription factors including NF-IL6 .
* '' Nuclear translocation of both NFxB p50 and p65 can be blocked by the serine protease inhibitor N-a-tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) , which stabilises IxBa against degradation . ''
NFxrB may play a central role in the regulation of chronic inflammation by controlling the transcription of inflammation genes .
Many of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes include NFxB binding sites , and most have been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by the factor . ''

mms mae mate n w Most interestingly , NFxB dimers containing p65 appear to have profound pro-inflammatory activity , whereas the p50 hom-odimer ( NFxB1 ) is either inactive or may even be involved in blocking NFxB sites in some inflammation gene promoters against binding of p65 dimers . ' '' '' ''
Overexpression of p50 homodimers has been suggested to be the mechanism of LPS refractoriness following repetitive stimulation - of - mononuclear phagocytes . ''
Recent studies suggest that activation of NFxB involving the p65 subunit may be a key event in trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid ( TNBS ) /ethanol colitis . ''
Although not shown in vivo , a role for NFxB p65 activation in the regulation of intestinal inflammation in IBD seems likely .
In this study we show increased levels of NFxB p65 in nuclear extracts of intestinal lamina propria biopsy samples from patients with IBD .

Total mucosal levels of IxBa « are not different in patients with IBD and controls .
Biopsy specimens as well as isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells ( LPMNCs ) from patients with active IBD show enhanced activation of NFxB in comparison with controls .
Therefore activation of NFxB , which involves the p65 subunit , may contribute to the enhanced expression of inflammation genes observed in IBD .
Steroids protect IxBa from degradation in vitro and thereby reduce the amount of available functionally active nuclear NFxB by inhibiting translocation of the p65 subunit .
Inhibition of NFxB driven transcriptional control of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be an important factor in the anti-inflammatory action of steroids in IBD .
Materials and methods Fetal calf serum was purchased from Gibco ( Grand Island , NY , USA ) or Sigma ( St Louis , MO , USA ) .
Cytokine enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay ( ELISA ) kits were obtained from Genzyme/Virotech ( Riisselsheim , Germany ) and from DPC Biermann ( Bad Nauheim , Germany ) .
Recombinant TNF-u was purchased from Genzyme , and antibodies against IxBa and NFxB p65 from Santa Cruz ( Heidelberg , Germany ) .

PATIENTS A total of 35 patients with active Crohn 's disease and 39 patients with active ulcerative colitis participated in the study ( the exact numbers of patients being investigated in the different experiments conducted are indi-cated ) .
All patients with IBD were attending the outpatient clinics of the Charité University Hospital in Berlin because of increased clinical activity .
At the time that blood was withdrawn or mucosal biopsy samples were obtained , 25/35 patients with Crohn 's disease and 35/39 patients with ulcerative colitis were receiving treatment with oral salicylates ( mesalazine ( Salofalk , Claversal or Pentasa ) , salazosulfapy-ridine ( Azulfidine or Colopleon ) , olsalazine ( Dipentum ) ) .

underwent sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for routine clinical evaluation .
Only patients with inflammatory activity indicated by endoscopic assessment were included .
Infection or parasites were excluded by stool cultures , microscopic stool examination , and serology ( yers-inia ) .
Blood was withdrawn after informed consent , and the study was granted prior approval by the institutional review board .
Normal controls were age and sex matched healthy volunteers .
Disease specificity controls included patients with diverticulitis , salmonel-losis , and infectious enterocolitis .
HUMAN LPMNCsS Colonic biopsy specimens were obtained during routine colonoscopy , and LPMNCs were isolated from intestinal mucosa biopsy samples as described previously . ''
In brief , after overnight collagenase digestion , the cell suspension was collected , layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient ( specific gravity 1.077 ) , and centrifuged at 400 g for 40 minutes .
Cells were harvested from the interphase between medium and Ficoll , washed and resuspended in 10 ml phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 10 % neonatal calf serum , centrifuged at 500 g for 15 minutes , and the cell pellet resuspended in culture medium .
The percentage of macro-phages was determined by both non-specific esterase detection ( Sigma ) and staining for CD68 ( Dako Diagnostika GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) using the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase ( APAAP ) technique ( Vec-tor Laboratories , from Dako ) .
Additional controls were performed by fluorescence activated flow cytometry ( FACS ) using the FITC-Leu-M3 antibody ( Becton-Dickinson , Moun-tainview , CA , USA ) .
Contamination of epithelial cells was found to be less than 0.5 % by both morphological examination and cytokeratin antibody ( Dako ) staining .
The percentage of macrophages , CD4 T cells , CD8 T cells , and B 479 cells found was similar to that described in earlier flow cytometric studies . ''
CELL CULTURES AND CYTOKINE ASSAYS Cells were cultured at a concentration of 1 x 10®/ml in RPMI 1640 ( supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 1 % pyruvate , 100 U/ml penicillin , and 50 ug/ml gentamicin ) .
After 24 hours , supernatants were separated from cells by centrifugation , snap frozen and stored at -70°C until determination of cytokine levels .
Supernatant concentrations of TNF-a , IL-18 and IL-1ra were assessed using a specific sandwich ELISA .
All samples were analysed in triplicate or duplicate .
The amount of cross reactivity was assessed by comparison with the concentration yielding a 50 % inhibition of binding .
Specificity of the ELISAs was demonstrated by the finding that up to 100 pg/ml IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , granulocyte colony stimulating factor , granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor , and TNF-a showed no significant cross reactivity or interference .
Sensitivity levels were between 2.0 pg/ml ( IL-18 ) and 4.0 pg/ml ( TNF-a ) , and intra- and inter-assay precision variability was below 3 % . ''
Repeated thawing and freezing of the cultured cells , which would release cytokines stored in the cytoplasm , did not increase the cytokine levels significantly .
Therefore all cytokines synthesised were secreted into the supernatant .
For analysis of transcription factor activation , cells from patients with IBD and normal control cells were incubated for 15-90 minutes with LPS ( 1 ug/tal ) .
EXTRACTS Biopsy samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of removal and later mechanically homogenised in liquid nitrogen ( Dounce homogeniser ) .
Cells were pelleted and immediately fractionated .
Nuclear and cytosolic extracts respectively were prepared by adaptation of previously described techniques through freeze/thaw cycles between crushed ice and liquid nitrogen . ''
** Cytosolic extracts were collected in an aqueous buffer containing 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 1.5 mM MgCl , , and 10 mM KCI Nuclear extracts were prepared by solubilising the remaining nuclei in a second buffer containing 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 420 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , and 25 % glycerol .
Both buffers were supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride , 1 pg/ml aprotinin , 1 ug/ml leupeptin , 1 ug/ml pepstatin , 1 mM benzamidine , 1 mM sodium vanadate , and 1 mM NaF .
The purity of the extract fractions was tested by marker proteins exclusively expressed in one of the compartments ( IxBa and fructose aldolase as markers for the cytosol and OCT-1 as a nuclear marker ) . ''
`` `` For the assessment of total expression levels of the proteins studied , western blot experiments were performed utilising snap frozen cell pellets or homogenised biopsy specimens which were lysed in boiling extraction buffer ( 1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate , 10 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 1 mM sodium vanadate ) .

Results INCREASED EXPRESSION OF NFKB P65 IN NUCLEAR EXTRACTS FROM COLONIC BIOPSY SAMPLES OF PATIENTS WITH IBD Nuclear protein from colonic biopsy samples was extracted .
Nuclear levels of NFB p65 protein were evaluated by western blot in colonic biopsy samples of ten patients with active Crohn 's disease , 14 patients with active ulcerative colitis , six disease specificity controls , and seven normal controls ( table 1 ) .
Samples were diluted to equal concentrations of total protein before analysis .
Patients with Crohn 's disease exhibited higher levels of nuclear NFxB p65 than those with ulcerative colitis ( p = 0.035 ) , disease specificity controls ( p = 0.0312 ) , and normal volunteers ( p = 0.0012 ) .
In patients with ulcerative colitis , more nuclear NFxB p65 was found than in normal controls ( p = 0.038 ) , but no statistical difference was seen in comparison with disease specificity controls .
The increased expression of nuclear NFxB p65 in disease specificity controls did not reach significance in comparison with normal controls ( fig 1 ) .
Alternatively , biopsy specimens from the same sites were homogenised for the assessment of total tissue concentrations of NFxB p65 protein .
Total levels of NFxB p65 were not different in patients with Crohn 's disease , those with ulcerative colitis , normal controls , and disease specificity controls ( fig 2 ) , and no differences in IxBa levels were seen between the groups ( fig 2 ) .
DNA BINDING OF NUCLEAR NFKB IS INCREASED IN EXTRACTS FROM LAMINA PROPRIA BIOPSY SAMPLES AS WELL AS IN LPMNCS ISOLATED FROM COLONIC BIOPSY SPECIMENS FROM PATIENTS WITH IBD The increased levels of NFB p65 in nuclear extracts in Crohn 's disease indicate that there may also be increased amounts of NFxB dimers which are capable of specific binding to consensus oligonucleotides .
Figure 3 shows a representative gel shift experiment demonstrating increased amounts of DNA binding of NFxB in nuclear extracts from biopsy specimens ( fig 3A ) as well as isolated LPMNCs ( fig 3B ) .
In all Crohn 's disease biopsy samples as well as unstimulated LPMNCs , greatly increased levels of nuclear NFB could be detected by its specific oligonucleotide binding activity .
In contrast with normal controls , most patients with ulcerative colitis also showed increased amounts of NFxB .

INHIBITION OF NFKB TRANSLOCATION DOWN-REGULATES PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE SECRETION BY IBD LPMNCS The serine protease inhibitor TPCK inhibits activation of NFxB by preventing nuclear translocation of both p65 and p50 through stabilisation of IxBa . ''

Activating stimuli including tumour necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) promote degradation of IxBa and the subsequent release of NFB p65 into the cytosolic compartment .
NFkB p65 translocates into the nucleus and forms dimers as part of the activation process .
Functionally active NFKB can then bind to specific sites in inflammation gene promoter regions and initiate transcription .
Steroids appear to stabilise IxBa against activation induced degradation and thereby reduce the amount of functionally active NFB available in the nucleus .

Dexamethasone as well as TPCK stabilised IxBa against LPS induced proteolysis analogously to the effect previously described in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( fig 4B ) .
STEROID TREATMENT REDUCES ACTIVATION OF NFKB Nuclear extracts were prepared from sigmoid biopsy samples from seven patients with highly active Crohn 's ileocolitis and additional inflammation in the sigma ( CDAI 250-450 ) , before they received steroid treatment .
Patients were examined again after seven days of treatment with high dose systemic ( 60 mg prednisolone/day ) and topical ( 5 mg betamethasone in 100 ml , twice daily ) steroids .
Nuclear levels of NFxB were decreased in all patients by steroid treatment ( fig 5 ; p = 0.0156 ) , whereas IxBa concentrations remained unchanged or were also decreased ( data not shown ) .
Discussion Both IL-18 and TNF-a have been suggested to be important mediators involved in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in IBD .
Increased secretion by isolated IBD LPMNCs as well as whole biopsy samples has been shown in comparison with normal control cells .
Activation of NFxB may be a pivotal event in pro-inflammatory - signal Transcription factor members of the Rel-NFxB family , which in resting cells are bound to cytoplasmic inhibitory factors ( for example IxB , NFxB p105 ) , are released on activation induced degradation of their cytoplasmic inhibitors by the proteasome/ubiquitin complex . ''
`` ~ '' ** NFxB p65 hetero- or homodimers migrate to the nucleus and regulate transcriptional activity by binding to specific DNA sequences in promoter/enhancer regions of inflammation genes . ''
° We therefore investigated both the level of nuclear NFB p65 protein and oligonucleotide binding of activated nuclear NFxB .
Intestinal biopsy specimens were investigated because they reflect the in vivo state of NFxB activation without any potential alterations that may be caused by in vitro isolation procedures .
We found increased amounts of NFxB p65 protein in nuclear extracts of mucosal biopsy samples of patients with Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis in comparison with both disease specificity controls and normal controls .
The highest levels were seen consistently in lamina propria biopsy samples from patients with Crohn 's disease .
Potential candidates responsible for the activation of the NFB system in Crohn 's disease may include TNF-a .
Recent immunological as well as therapeutic studies suggest that TNF-a plays a major role in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation in Crohn 's disease '' but it may be less important in chronic ulcerative colitis . ''
The increased nuclear concentrations of NFxB p65 detected in IBD mucosal biopsy samples may partially be a product of TNF stimulation by non-immune cells-for example , epithelial cells .
TNF induced involvement of NFxB in the regulation of inflamma- NFB in inflammatory bowel disease tion genes in these cells may be an important regulatory mechanism in the inflammatory process .
Several other cell types should also be discussed as potential contributors to the activation of the NFxB system seen in intestinal lamina propria in IBD .
Protein concentrations ( as assessed by western blot ) of NFxB p65 and IxBa were not different in intestinal mucosa from patients with IBD , disease specificity controls and normal controls if total tissue extracts were not separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts .
This finding is expected because activation of NFxB results in a shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus .
Moreover , IxB concentrations , which are decreased by degradation in response to a stimulus , rapidly returned to their original levels in vitro within less than 90 minutes . '' ''
Translocation into the nucleus and binding to specific DNA sequences are important events which are prerequisites for transcriptional control by NFxB .
Enhanced detection of NFxB p65 protein should therefore be accompanied by increased availability of oligonucleotide binding of NFxB .
Increased nuclear levels of consensus oligonucleotide binding of activated NFxB were detected in both Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis biopsy samples as well as LPMNCs in comparison with normal controls .
Crohn 's disease LPMNCs again appeared to contain more NFxB p65 protein in nuclear extracts than LPMNCs from patients with ulcerative colitis .
The heightened activation of NFxB could be a major regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in IBD .
However , a host of other activating stimuli , including TNF and LPS , may also induce the activation of NFxB as a secondary event .
In order to dissect the regulatory role of NFxB in IBD , we tried to block the release of cytosolic NFxB proteins into the nuclear compartment using the serine protease inhibitor TPCK . ''
TPCK strongly down-regulated the increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-18 in LPMNCs from patients with IBD .
These experiments indicate a regulatory role for activated NFB in the inflammatory cytokine response in IBD .
Moreover , it appears that NFxB p65 ( RelA ) , which has been suggested to have a greater pro-inflammatory role in the induction of inflammation gene expression than p50 , '' is an important factor in the regulation of intestinal inflammation in IBD .
Our results which demonstrate increased nuclear levels of NFB p65 as well as activated oligonucleotide binding of NFxB in IBD support the concept of a perpetuating stimulation of the NFxB system , which is characterised by rapid activation and de-activation kinetics . '' ''
In vitro exposure to steroids rapidly inhibits NFxB activation .
Previous reports have shown that glucocorticoids use stabilisation of IxBa as part of their anti-inflammatory mechanism of action . ''
* Our study confirms that steroids cause in vitro reduction of activated NFxB in IBD LPM-NCs .
Moreover , in vivo treatment with high dose steroids leads to inhibition of NFxB p65 activation in Crohn 's disease , which paralleled clinical improvement of patients .
However , this 483 inhibition of NFxB activation was not accompanied by in vivo enhancement of IxBa , as would have been expected from in vitro systems . ''
`` ° Studies currently being performed therefore examine the role of the IxB/NFxB system during clinical relapse of disease from remission and in experimental treatment situations in IBD ( glucocorticoids , IL-10 , anti-TNF antibodies ) .
Activation of NFxB may play a central role in the initiation of the relapsing inflammatory process and moreover may be targeted by the therapeutic mechanism of various - anti-inflammatory - drugs - including corticosteroids '' * and aminosalicylates ( fig 6 ) . ''
Activation of NFB may be a pivotal element in the pathophysiology of chronic intestinal inflammation , but is unlikely to be the primary cause of IBD .
