We analyzed the effects of hemin or TPA induction on the binding and activity of transcription factors at a regulatory element found within the transcriptional regulatory sequences of many erythroid-specific genes .
TPA induction increases the binding of ubiquitous AP-1 factors to this element .
TPA induction inhibits the binding of the lineage limited transcription factor NF-E2 to this transcriptional control element .
Hemin induction of K562 cells does not facilitate the binding of NF-E2 to its recognition site .
Hemin induction appears to nonspecifically increase the expression of transiently transfected genes in K562 cells .
Beyond this nonspecific increase in gene expression , hemin induction acts to increase the activity of the lineage limited transcription factor NF-E2 .
The divergent effects of hemin and TPA on gene expression in K562 cells are mediated , in part , by their contrasting effects on the transcription factor NF-E2 .
With rare exception , progression of cells along a distinctive tissue phenotype requires the differential expression of an invariant genotype .
Regulation of the differential expression of the genotype occurs along a pathway that begins at the transcription of gene templates into mRNAs and ends with the translation of mRNAs into proteins .
One of the initial steps in the process of gene transcription is the attachment of transcriptional regulatory proteins to binding sites , composed of a short defined sequence of base pairs , within the genome .
The attachment of transcriptional regulatory proteins such as myoD or GATA-1 to their binding sites may be sufficient to activate the expression of the muscle-specific ( myoD ) or erythroid-specific ( GATA-1 ) phenotype ( 1 , 2 ) .
It is therefore no surprise that some molecules capable of inducing a cell to express a tissue-specific phenotype have been shown to alter the affinities ( and activities ) of transcrip- * This work was supported by Grant DK 39566 ( to W. B. S. ) from the National Institutes of Health .

tional regulatory proteins for their binding sites within the genome .
To understand how the inducing agents hemin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) ' produce distinctive patterns of gene expression in the multipotent human cell line K562 , we studied the attachment ( and activity ) of transcriptional regulatory proteins to a binding site found within the K562 genome .
This binding site , found both near to and far from the site of the initiation of transcription of many erythroid-specific genes , has the ability to bind ubiquitous and tissue-specific transcription factors .
In comparison to uninduced K562 cells , hemin-induced K562 cells demonstrate increases in embryonic and fetal hemoglobin accumulation and other proteins associated with erythroid differentiation ( 3 ) .
In contrast , induction of K562 cells with TPA results in expression of markers of megakar-yocytic differentiation ( 4 , 5 ) .
The effects of hemin or TPA on K562 cells are mediated in part at the level of transcriptional initiation .
At least some of the increase in hemoglobin accumulation in hemin-induced K562 cells is due to increases in the rate of transcription of the a , e , and y globin genes ( 6 , 7 ) .
In contrast , exposure of K562 cells to TPA results in a 4-fold decrease in the rate of transcriptional initiation at y globin promoters , as well as a decrease in the stability of globin mRNA ( 8 ) .
The core DNA sequence through which the effect of TPA on transcription is mediated , is the TPA-responsive element ( TRE ) TGAC/GTCA ( 9 ) .
The TRE , found in many enhancers and promoters , is the recognition site for the AP-1 group of dimeric transcription factors .
AP-1 factors are members of the c-Fos and c-Jun oncoprotein family ( 10-12 ) .
TPA induction increases the amount as well as the affinity of Jun/Fos heterodimers for binding to the TRE ( 13 , 14 ) .
The cis-acting regulatory sequences through which hemin increases transcriptional initiation are not as well defined .
A transcriptional regulatory sequence reported to be hemin-responsive is 55-GCTGAGTCA-3 ' ( 15 ) .
This nonameric sequence binds NF-E2 , a transcription factor found in cells of erythroid or megakaryocytoid lineage ( 16 , 17 ) .
Within this nonameric recognition sequence is the heptameric recognition sequence for the AP-1 factors .
Point mutation of the 5 guanosine to thymidine abolishes binding of NF-E2 while maintaining binding of AP-1 factors ( 18 ) .
Binding sites for NF-E2 are found in many erythroid-specific transcriptional regulatory sequences , including the promoter of the porphob- ' The abbreviations used are : TPA , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ; TRE , TPA-responsive element ; bp , base pair ( s ) ; MEL , murine erythroleukemia ; FCS , fetal calf serum ; RSV , Rous sarcoma virus ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase .
5089 5090 ilinogen deaminase gene ( 14 ) , the locus control region for a globin genes ( 15 ) , and the locus control region for $ globin expression ( 15 , 20 ) .
The most powerful transcriptional enhancer element within the locus control region for 3 globin gene domain expression is a HindIlI-Bgill fragment of 5HS2 ( 21 ) .
Analysis of subfragments of 5HS2 shows that a short 46-bp sequence is necessary but not sufficient for enhancer activity equal to the HindIlII-Bgill fragment ( 19 , 20 ) .
This 46-bp sequence has been shown to bind the lineage limited NF-E2 protein and ubiquitous AP-1 proteins when assayed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( 15 , 20 , 22 ) .
The specific purpose of our studies was to determine whether the divergent effects of TPA or hemin induction on gene expression in K562 cells are due , at least in part , to differences in the binding and/or the activity of transcription factors at NF-E2/AP-1 binding sites .
Using the core regulatory sequence of 5HS2 as a model for binding at NF-E2/AP-1 sites , we investigated the binding of transcription factors in hemin or TPA-induced K562 cells .
We also examined the effects of hemin or TPA induction on the transcriptional activity of NF-E2/AP-1 binding sites linked to a promoter element that binds ubiquitous transcription factors .
We show that 72 h of TPA induction of K562 cells inhibits the binding of NF-E2 to its binding site .
We demonstrate that hemin induction is not required for the binding of NF-E2 to its binding site .
We also show that beyond a general stimu-latory effect of hemin induction on the expression of plasmids transiently transfected into K562 cells , there is additional stimulation by hemin , at the level of transcriptional initiation , of plasmids containing NF-E2 binding sites .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture-K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 + 10 % fetal calf serum .
For hemin induction , K562 cells were grown with 20 um hemin added for 72 h. For TPA induction , K562 cells were grown with 34 nM TPA added for 72 h. HL6O cells were grown in RPMI 1640 + 10 % FCS ; HL6O cells were induced with 34 nM TPA for 72 h. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium + 5 % FCS .
MEL cells were grown in RPMI 1640 + 10 % FCS and induced with 3 % Me , SO for 72 h. In Vitro Footprinting-Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells by the method of Dignam et al .
( 23 ) with phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride , leupeptin , aprotinin , and pepstatin added to all buffers .
5HS2 was digested with restriction enzymes to generate subfragments .
Subfragments of 5HS2 were end-labeled with P. The end-labeled fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis through acrylamide .
Nuclear extract was bound to end-labeled fragment for 15 min at room temperature and then exposed to DNase I for 1 min at 22 °C .
Reaction products were separated on sequencing gels and autoradiographed .
In Vivo Methylation Protection Footprinting-10 '' uninduced , 20 uM hemin-induced , or 34 nM TPA-induced K562 cells were suspended in 1 mi of medium at room temperature and exposed to a final concentration of 0.1 % dimethyl sulfide for 10 min , in order to partially methylate their genomic DNA in vivo .
Each methylation reaction was quenched with 20 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline .
Partially methylated genomic DNA was extracted from the cells , then digested to completion with EcoRI .
The control , protein-free DNA , was digested to completion with EcoRI and then partially methylated in vitro .
Methylated DNA was cleaved with piperidine according to the method of Maxam and Gilbert ( 24 ) .
Genomic footprinting was performed using ligation-mediated PCR as described by Mueller and Wold ( 25 ) .
The following primer set was used to visualize the NF-E2/TAP-1 region of 5HS2 .
Sequenase primer : Ligation linker and primer are the same as published by Mueller and Wold ( 25 ) .
Suppression of a Differentiation Program by Phorbol Ester PCR primer : 5'-TAAGCATCCTGCTGGGGACCCAGAT-3 ' Labeling primer : 5 ( -GCATCCTGCTGGGGACCCAGATAGGAG-3 ' Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis-After preincubation of nuclear extract with 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) on ice for 20 min , the protein-DNA binding reaction was at 20°C for 15 min .
DNA was end-labeled with P. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 4 % acrylamide gels made in 0.25 M TBE and 5 % glycerol .
Electrophoresis was run at 4 °C for 4 h. For experiments using antibodies to c-jun , a polyclonal antibody to the DNA binding domain of c-Jun ( Oncogene Science ) was prein-cubated with nuclear extract prior to the protein-DNA binding reaction .
Polyclonal antibody to an amino-terminal epitope of c-jun ( Oncogene Science ) was added following the protein-DNA binding reaction .
The oligonucleotides shown in Table I were used in protein-DNA binding reactions ( only top strand is shown ; all binding reactions were done with double-stranded DNA ) .
Transient Expression Experiments-Each test plasmid was constructed by insertion of a transcriptionally active sequence into the Bgill site of the vector pA10CAT2 .
pA10CAT32 contains the SV40 early promoter and the CAT reporter gene ( Table II ) .
4 X 10 '' uninduced K562 cells were electroporated with 30 ug of a test plasmid and 6 ug of the RSV luciferase plasmid at 280 V and 960 microfarads of capacitance using a Bio-Rad electroporator with a capacitance extender .
Following the electroporation , each cuvette of cells was transferred into a dish of media .
After an 8-h recovery period each `` parental '' dish of cells was split into four equal dishes .
Of the four `` progeny '' dishes of cells , one remained uninduced , while each of the remaining three dishes of cells underwent induction with hemin or other inducing agents .
This procedure insures equal electroporation efficiency between dishes of cells containing the same test plasmid .
After 60 h of induction , whole cell lysates were made .
The protein concentration of each whole cell lysate was measured by the method of Bradford ( 26 ) .
Equal amounts of protein from each whole cell lysate were tested for CAT and luciferase activity using standard protocols .
RESULTS In Vitro Footprints of 5 HS2-We used DNase I footprinting of subfragments of the 732-bp HindlII-Bgill 5'HS2 enhancer element as an initial check for differences in transcription factor binding of nuclear extracts produced from hemin versus TPA-induced K562 cells .
We also checked for differences between nuclear extracts produced from erythroid ( K562 and MEL ) versus non-erythroid cell lines ( HeLa and HL60 ) .
The HindIII-Avall subfragment of 5HS2 has a prominent 31-bp footprint containing an NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site ( Fig .
1 , left panel , open box with arrow ) .
These 31 bases contain a perfect consensus sequence for the binding of the tissue-specific transcription factor NF-E2 and an 8/9 match consensus sequence for the binding of NF-E2 .
The perfect match is 5 and the near-perfect match is 3 ' .
Within these nonameric sequences are perfect heptameric consensus sequences for the binding of AP-1 transcription factors , factors that are found in all tissues .
This footprint was produced by nuclear extracts made from K562 , MEL ( erythroid ) , HL60 ( myeloid ) , and HeLa ( epithelial ) cell lines , and is therefore not tissue-specific ( Fig .
1 , left panel , and Fig .
2 ) .
This footprinted sequence has been shown to be necessary for the transcriptional enhancer activity of 5HS2 ( 15 ) .
However , within and near to the 5 boundary of the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 footprint ( within the perfect consensus sequence for the binding of NF-E2 ) , a prominent cleavage band is generated by a HeLa cell nuclear extract ( Fig .
1 , left panel and Fig .
2 , open box ( cleavage band is at arrow ) ) .
This cleavage band is not produced by K562 , MEL , or uninduced HL60 nuclear extracts .
The presence of this cleavage band in the footprint generated by the HeLa cell nuclear extract suggests that the protein that binds to the 5 half of the NF-E2/ Suppression of a Differentiation Program by Phorbol Ester 5091 TABLE I Oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays Oligonucleotide Sequence Description TNF-E2 5'-CAATGCTGAGTCATGATGAGTCATGCTGAGG-3 ' 5'NF-E2 5'-CAGCAATGCTGAGTCATGATG-3 ' 5'AP1 5'-CAGCAATTCTGAGTCATGATG-3 ' NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site , identical to the in vitro footprinted sequence .

The right panel ( top of gel is Xbal site ) also demonstrates the NF-E2/TAP-1 and SV40 enhancer core footprints .
tandem AP-1 binding site in HeLa cells differs from the protein that binds in erythroid cell lines K562 and MEL .
Nuclear extract from uninduced promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 does not produce this cleavage band within the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 footprint .
This indicates that the protein that binds in uninduced HL6O nuclear extract differs from the HeLa cell protein and may be identical to the protein found in erythroid nuclear extracts .

Footprinted sequences are the same as described in Fig .

The arrow within the open box points to the prominent cleavage band found in the non-erythroid cell line HeLa , as well as TPA-induced HL6O cells .
from TPA-induced HL60 cells produces this cleavage band ( and in TPA-induced K562 cells ; data not shown ) , indicating that different proteins bind to this NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site in TPA-induced HL6O cells compared to uninduced HL60 cells ( Fig .
2 , compare HL60 lanes to HL60 + T ) .
In order to confirm that a protein with characteristics similar to NF-E2 is indeed found in uninduced HL6O cells , we performed mobility shift assays as well as in vivo footprinting .
The results are reported below .
Immediately flanking the 5 boundary of the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 footprint is another footprint ( Fig .
1 , left panel , open box beneath box with arrow ) in the same location as a footprint reported by Nienhuis ( 19 ) .
Immediately flanking the 3 ' boundary of the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 footprint is a footprint , not previously reported , which contains an SV40 enhancer core element ( Fig .
1 , hatched box in left panel ) .
This footprint is not an artifact created by the HindIII-Avall subfragment .
The same footprint is found when other subfragments of 5'HS2 are used in the footprinting reaction ( Fig .
1 , hatched boxes in center and right panels ) .
The Ball-Xbal fragment contains two additional footprints ( Fig .
1 , right 5092 panel ) , corresponding to a GATA-1 binding site and to a binding site for H-BP described by Talbot and Grosveld ( 17 ) .
Our initial survey for hemin- or TPA-inducible binding differences also included the Xbal-BgiII fragment .
We found , as others have reported , two large footprints overlying long stretches of AT repeats and a GATA-1 footprint ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of Uninduced K562 Nuclear Extract Binding to the NF-E2/Tandem AP-1 Footprint of 5°HS2-When nuclear extract produced from uninduced K562 cells is used in a protein-DNA binding reaction with the wild type 31-bp TNF-E2 oligonucleotide ( containing an NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site ) and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay , at least four specific shifted bands , A-D , are detected ( Fig .
3 , TNF-E2 K- and KH ) .
Oligonucleotide 5'NF-E2 containing only the 5 NF-E2/AP-1 site yields three specific bands : B , C , and D ( Fig .
3 , 5'NFE-2 K- and KH ) .
We therefore conclude that the band with slowest mobility , band A , can only be produced when there are tandem binding sites .
Oligonucleotide which differs from 5'NF-E2 solely in a G - T transversion at the 5 guanosine thought to be discriminatory for binding of NF-E2 ( 18 ) , produces only bands B and C ( Fig .
3 , 5'AP1 K- and KH ) .
We conclude that band D is formed by the binding of a factor that has the characteristics of NF-E2 .
This pattern of shifted bands was reproduced with different nuclear extracts made over the course of 1 year , and by two different methods .
These results were also confirmed using specific and nonspecific cold competitor DNA .
We confirmed that at least some of the formation of bands A , B , and C was secondary to binding of c-jun , because incubation of a polyclonal antibody to the DNA binding domain of c-jun with nuclear extract prior to the protein-DNA binding reaction inhibits the formation of these bands ( Fig .
4B , compare + antibody lanes to - antibody lanes ) .

The NF-E2/tandem AP-1 oligonucleotide was end-labeled with *P. Each lane contained nuclear extract that produced an equal mobility shift with an SP-1-specific oligonucleotide .

In the right panel , the P -end-labeled 5 AP1 oligonucleotide differs from the 5NF-E2 oligonucleotide , used in the center panel , in a single G - T transversion at the G known to be required for binding of NF-E2 .

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using HL6O0 nuclear extract ( panel A ) and the effect of polyclonal antibody to DNA binding domain of c-jun ( Ab1 ) or polyclonal antibody .
In panel A , the mobility shift pattern of HL6O nuclear extract is compared to the mobility shift pattern of K562 nuclear extract .
In panel B , - lanes indicate a binding reaction done in the absence of antibody , and + lanes indicate preincubation of nuclear extract with a polyclonal antibody to the DNA binding domain of c-jun .
In comparison to the - lanes , the + lanes show a decrease in the intensity of bands A-C , while band D is not diminished .
In panel C , a polyclonal antibody to c-jun that does not react with the DNA binding domain results in the production of a hypershifted band A ' .
after the protein-DNA binding reaction , results in the generation of a very slowly migrating `` hypershifted '' band ; this confirms that some of the formation of bands A , B , and C requires the presence of c-jun ( Fig .
4C ) .
Neither antibody perturbs the formation of band D , the putative NF-E2 band .
The Effect of Hemin or TPA Induction of K562 Cells on Transcription Factor Binding to the NF-E2/Tandem AP-1 Binding Site-In order to determine whether hemin- or TPA-induced K562 cell nuclear extracts exhibited differences in binding to the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 oligonucleotide , every protein binding reaction to the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 oligonucleotide used an amount of nuclear extract that yielded equal binding to an SP-1 binding site .
Using each of the nuclear extracts equalized in this manner , there appears to be a small but reproducible increase in the amount of NF-E2 in hemin-induced K562 nuclear extracts compared to uninduced K562 cell nuclear extracts ( Fig .
3 , panels TNF-E2 and 5 NF-E2 ) .
However , band D , the NF-E2 band , was generated by uninduced K562 nuclear extract , suggesting that inducing amounts of hemin are not required for binding of NF-E2 to its recognition sequence .
When nuclear extract obtained from K562 cells induced for 72 h with TPA was used in a binding reaction with oligonucleotide TNF-E2 , bands A-C , the c-jun containing bands , increased in intensity compared to the same bands produced by uninduced and hemin-induced K562 cell nuclear extracts ( Fig .
3 , TNF-E2 ) .
The TPA-induced increases in intensity of bands A-C can be attributed to a known effect of TPA induction , which is to increase the amount and affinity of AP-1 factors for their cognate binding sites ( 13 , 14 ) .
To our surprise , band D formed by binding of NF-E2 was absent or markedly diminished ( at least a 4-fold decrease ) when the TPA-induced K562 cell nuclear extract was used in a binding reaction with oligonucleotide TNF-E2 ( Fig .
3 , TNF-E2 KT lane ) .
This result was consistently obtained using different nuclear extracts produced from separate exposures of K562 cells to TPA .
Suppression of a Differentiation Program by Phorbol Ester TPA induction increased band A , the band formed by occupancy of both NF-E2/AP-1 binding sites .
Band A is probably formed by occupancy of two molecules of AP-1 or occupancy by a molecule of NF-E2 and AP-1 .
Some of the decrease in band D formation could be secondary to increased tandem occupancy of the TNF-E2 oligonucleotide due to an increased chance of a molecule of NF-E2 and AP-1 binding to the same molecule of probe .
Increased tandem occupancy would consequently increase the formation of band A at the expense of formation of band D. However , when TPA-induced K562 cell nuclear extract is used in a binding reaction with oligonucleotide 5'NF-E2 containing a single NF-E2/AP-1 binding site , formation of band D is still markedly diminished ( Fig .
3 , 5'NF-E2 KT lane ) .
Concomitantly , there are marked increases in the intensity of bands B and C ( Fig .
3 , 5'NF-E2 KT lane ) .
Because oligonucleotide 5 NF-E2 contains a single NF-E2/AP-1 binding site , the absence of band D can not be ascribed to increased production of a band ( band A ) whose formation requires occupancy of two NF-E2/AP-1 binding sites .
Increases in AP-1 factors in the TPA-induced K562 cell nuclear extract could produce loss of the NF-E2 band as a result of direct competition between increased amounts of AP-1 factors with NF-E2 for occupancy of the single NF-E2/ AP -1 binding site of oligonucleotide 5 NF-E2 .
However , direct competition for a limiting amount of protein binding sites can not be the sole reason for the loss of band D. Oligonucleotide 5'NF-E2 is in excess and is not limiting for protein binding sites , as evidenced by significant amounts of unbound probe ( see Fig .
3 , lanes TNF-E2 KT and 5'NF-E2 KT ) .
To confirm that competition between TPA-induced AP-1 factors with NF-E2 was not solely responsible for the loss of the NF-E2 band , we added to the TPA-induced K562 nuclear extract a 100-fold molar excess of cold competitor DNA specific for binding AP-1 factors .
As expected , preincubation with cold AP-1-specific competitor resulted in a loss of bands formed by AP-1 proteins .
There was no restoration of band D , the NF-E2 band ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding in Uninduced or TPA-induced HL60 Nuclear Extract-Because the NF-E2/ tandem AP-1 footprint generated by the non-erythroid , uninduced HL60 cell nuclear extract was identical to the footprint produced by the erythroid K562 nuclear extract , we determined whether HL6O0 cells contained a protein that has characteristics similar to those of NF-E2 in K562 cells .
When uninduced HL60 nuclear extract was used in a binding reaction with oligonucleotide TNF-E2 , a band was produced with mobility identical to band D formed by uninduced K562 nuclear extract ( Fig .
4 , left panel , lane HL60 ) .
Furthermore , nuclear extract from HL6O cells induced with TPA for 72 h did not generate band D. Thus , the protein that forms band D in HL60 cells appears to have the same characteristics as the protein that forms band D in K562 cells .
The results of our mobility shift assays indicated that the inducing agents hemin and TPA had divergent effects on the binding of transcriptional regulatory proteins to the NF-E2/ tandem AP-1 binding site of 5'HS2 .
To confirm that these findings had functional significance , we proceeded to investigate the pattern of binding to the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site in intact viable erythroid and non-erythroid cell lines .
Transcription Factor Binding in Vivo at the TAP/NF-E2 Site in the Non-erythroid Cell Line HeLa-The presence of a transcription factor in a nuclear extract that binds to DNA is likely to be sufficient to insure that it will indeed bind to its recognition sequence during a protein-DNA binding reaction .
However , in cells containing DNA organized into complex 5093 chromatin structures by histones , the regulation of transcription factor binding is more stringent than the mere presence of a transcription factor in the nucleus .
We used in vivo methylation protection to determine whether the NF-E2/ tandem AP-1 site within human 5'HS2 was occupied by proteins in non-erythroid and erythroid cell lines .
The results we report below are from three separate methylations of genomic DNA in HeLa , K562 , and HL6O cell lines .
In the non-erythroid cell line HeLa there are no clear differences in the methylation pattern of guanosine or adenosine nucleotides within the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site between genomic DNA methylated after exposure of intact cells to dimethyl sulfide and protein-free DNA methylated in vitro ( Fig .
5 , Hela panel ) .
This indicates that in HeLa cells the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site of 5HS2 is not likely to be accessible to transcriptional regulatory factors in vivo .
NF-E2 Binds to Its Recognition Site in Vivo in Uninduced K562 Cells-In the erythroid K562 cell line , there are clear differences in the methylation pattern of the NF-E2/tandem AP -1 site between genomic DNA methylated in the living cell and protein-free DNA partially methylated in vitro .
There is increased cleavage of adenosine nucleotides , as well as protection from methylation of the central guanosine nucleotides within each TRE ( Fig .

Therefore in K562 cells both the 5 and 3 ' binding sites for NF-E2/AP-1 are occupied by proteins in the intact cell .

In vivo dimethyl sulfate methylation protection ligation-mediated PCR footprinting across the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site .
The nucleotide sequence at the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site is indicated at left .
Arrows indicate guanosine nucleotides that are protected from methylation when intact cells are exposed to the methylating agent dimethyl sulfide .
Asterisks indicate adenosine nucleotides that are hypercleaved by piperidine in vitro after intact cells are exposed to the methylating agent dimethyl sulfide ( see `` Experimental Procedures '' for details ) .
Within the sequence GCTGAGTCA , located at the top of the gel , the most 5 ' G is required for binding of NF-E2 to the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
This G is protected from methylation after exposure of uninduced and hemin-induced K562 cells to dimethyl sulfide but not in TPA-induced K562 cells exposed to dimethyl sulfide .
To confirm that the visible differences between lanes were not due to differences in sample loading between each of the lanes , we performed laser densitometry on each lane to derive a ratio of the signal between the 5 guanosine ( 1st base ) and a guanosine nucleotide ( 24th base in sequence ) not footprinted in vitro .
K562 Vitro = 0.18 ; K562 Vivo ( uninduced ) = 0.03 ; K562 Vivo + H ( hemin ) = 0.03 ; K562 Vivo + T ( TPA ) = 0.15 .
At the second potential NF-E2 binding site , GATGAGTCA , the 5 guanosine is not protected from methylation after exposure of intact cells to dimethyl sulfide .
5094 from methylation in comparison to partially methylated protein-free DNA ( Fig .
5 , K562 panel , broad arrow is at the 5 guanosine ) .
Since mutation of this 5 guanosine to thymidine abolishes binding of NF-E2 as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift , we presume its protection from methylation in the intact cell is evidence for binding of NF-E2 to this site in living cells .
However , it appears that in intact cells only the 5 NF-E2/ AP-1 binding site is occupied by NF-E2 , because the discriminatory guanosine , which should be protected from methylation if NF-E2 bound to the 3 ' NF-E2/AP-1 site in intact cells , is not protected from methylation .
Therefore in vivo NF-E2 preferentially binds to the 5 NF-E2/AP-1 site , which has a perfect 9/9 match for the NF-E2 consensus binding sequence , and does not bind to the 3 ' NF-E2/AP-1 site , which has an 8/9 match for the NF-E2 binding sequence .
Effect of Hemin or TPA Induction on Binding of NF-E2 in Vivo in K562 Cells-There is no difference in the methylation protection pattern of the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site between 20 uM hemin-induced or uninduced K562 cells exposed to dimethyl sulfide ( Fig .
5 , K562 Vivo - versus +H ) .
In the presence of 20 uM hemin , the 55 NF-E2/AP-1 site is occupied by NF-E2 .
Hemin induction does not appear to change the affinity of NF-E2 for binding to DNA , because the 3 ' NF-E2/AP-1 binding site remains occupied by AP-1 factors and not by NF-E2 ( Fig .
5 , K562 Vivo - versus +H ) .
There are alterations in the pattern of methylation protection at the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site within 5HS2 in intact TPA-induced K562 cells compared to the pattern generated by methylation of this site in vitro , indicating that both the 5 ' and 3 ' NF-E2/AP-1 sites are occupied by transcriptional regulatory proteins in TPA-induced K562 cells .
However , in K562 cells induced with TPA for 72 h , the 5 guanosine of the 5 site is equally as accessible to methylation by dimethyl sulfate in living TPA-induced K562 cells as is protein-free naked DNA methylated in vitro ( Fig .
5 , compare K562 Vitro versus Vivo +TPA ) .
We conclude that NF-E2 does not bind to its recognition site in TPA-induced K562 cells .
The results of the in vivo footprinting are consistent with our data that demonstrate a marked decrease of the NF-E2-shifted band when nuclear extracts obtained from K562 cells induced with TPA for 72 h are used in a mobility shift assay .
We performed in vivo footprinting of uninduced and TPA-induced HL60 cells .
The methylation pattern demonstrated by uninduced HL6O cells indicates that a protein with characteristics similar to NF-E2 is indeed binding to the 5 NF-E2/AP-1 binding site .
After 72 h of TPA induction of HL60 cells , the 5 guanosine required for NF-E2 binding is no longer protected from methylation , indicating that the effect of TPA induction on binding to the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site is similar in HL6O and K562 cells ( data not shown ) .
NF-E2 Binding Sites Are Not Required for Hemin Inducibility of Reporter Gene Expression in K562 Cells-The results of the protein-DNA binding studies indicated that an inducing level of hemin is not required for binding of the limited lineage transcriptional regulatory protein NF-E2 to its recognition site .
However , TPA induction inhibited the binding of NF-E2 to its recognition site while increasing the binding of the ubiquitous AP-1 transcriptional regulatory proteins .
We therefore wanted to determine whether these differences in transcription factor binding to the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site of 5'HS2 could result in differences in its transcriptional activity .
We wished to determine whether 21 bp of 5HS2 containing the minimal sequence required to define the NF-E2/tandem Suppression of a Differentiation Program by Phorbol Ester AP-1 binding site , retained hemin inducibility during transient transfections .
We tested the plasmid TNF-E2 CAT , which contains this 21-bp sequence linked to a non-erythroid promoter element that binds general transcription factors .
TNF-E2 CAT was transiently electroporated into K562 cells .
Hemin-induced K562 cells contained up to 50-fold more CAT protein ( average 37.2 + 10.2 ) compared to the amount of CAT protein in uninduced K562 cells derived from the same electroporation of TNF-E2 CAT ( Fig .
6 ; see `` Experimental Procedures '' for details of the transient expression protocol ) .
A simple explanation for the hemin-induced increase in CAT expression in K562 cells is that hemin induction increases the viability or growth rate of cells following electroporation .
However , we did not detect any consistent differences in trypan blue dye exclusion , cell number , or protein concentration of whole cell lysates between uninduced K562 cells and hemin-induced K562 cells We conclude that the hemin-induced increase in CAT expression is not secondary to any general effect of hemin induction on cell growth .
We included the RSV luciferase plasmid in each electro-poration ; this plasmid does not contain any sequence derived from 5'HS2 .
It does contain a single AP-1 binding site but not an NF-E2 binding site .
Surprisingly we found up to a 17-fold ( 8.9 + 3.6 ) increase in luciferase activity in hemin-induced K562 cells compared to uninduced K562 cells derived from the same electroporation of RSV luciferase .
We find that hemin induction of K562 cells increases luciferase expression from a plasmid that does not contain an NF-E2 binding site .
We confirmed that an NF-E2 binding site was not required for a hemin-induced increase in gene expression because hemin induction of the transiently expressing TAP-1 CAT plasmid containing a triple point mutation at all guanosine nucleotides potentially required for binding of NF-E2 increased the level of CAT protein up to 9-fold ( 6.3 + 2.8 ) compared to uninduced K562 cells derived from the same electroporation ( Fig .
6 ) .
Hemin Has a Preferential Effect on Gene Expression at the Level of Transcriptional Initiation when NF-E2 Sites Are Present in the Transcriptional Control Element-However , NF-E2 binding sites permit a level of hemin induction of gene expression in K562 cells beyond the level that hemin confers onto plasmids containing tandem or single AP-1 binding sites .
After coelectroporation and transient expression of plasmids regulated by an NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site ( TNF-E2 CAT ) and an AP-1 site ( RSV luciferase ) , respectively , hemin induc- « e ser # 0 00 00 ~ o +H 00 - +H - +H 5 HS2 - TNF-E2 TAPI FiG .

Effect of hemin induction on CAT expression in transiently transfected K562 cells .
Each set of - and +H ( + hemin ) lanes represents a single cuvette of K562 cells coelectroporated with a test plasmid and the RSV luciferase plasmid .
After electroporation each cuvette of cells was split into two equal aliquots of cells ; one aliquot remained uninduced , the other was hemin-induced .
This insured equal transfection efficiency between the uninduced and induced cells .
For this set of electroporations , the -fold hemin induction compared to uninduced was as follows : 5'HS2 CAT , 7.5-fold ; TNF-E2 CAT , 51.6-fold ; TAP-1 CAT , 7.3-fold .
The respective hemin induction of the coelectroporated luciferase plasmid was 11.2- , 10.4- , and 7.1-fold .
The ratio of CAT /luciferase activity was : 5'HS2 , 0.67 ; TNF-E2 , 5.0 ; TAP-1 , 1.0 ( see `` Experimental Procedures '' for the details ) .
Suppression of a Differentiation Program by Phorbol Ester tion always increased the level of CAT protein more than luciferase protein .
The ratio of hemin induction of CAT protein relative to luciferase protein was consistently about 6 ( 6.1 + 1.1 ) .
This preferential effect of hemin on CAT expression in relation to luciferase expression is lost when the plasmid TAP-1 CAT , containing mutations in all guanosines potentially required for NF-E2 binding , is coelectroporated with RSV luciferase .
The level of hemin induction of CAT activity from the TAP-1 CAT plasmid never exceeded the level of hemin induction of luciferase protein .
Therefore the ratio of hemin induction of CAT protein relative to luciferase protein was consistently about 1 .
The sole difference between the plasmids TNF-E2 CAT and TAP-1 CAT resides in the transcriptionally active sequence , not in the mRNA or protein produced .
The average 6-fold relative increase in CAT expression compared to luciferase expression conferred onto the NF-E2 regulated plasmid NF-E2 CAT , in comparison to TAP 1 CAT , must therefore be at the level of transcriptional initiation .
TPA Can Also Induce CAT or Luciferase Protein When NF-E2 or AP-1 Binding Sites Are Present in the Transcriptional Control Element-Since our binding studies indicated that 72 h of TPA induction of K562 cells prevented the binding of NF-E2 to DNA , we wanted to ascertain whether TPA induction resulted in inhibition of transcription from plasmids containing NF-E2 binding sites .
We found that TPA induction of K562 cells could increase CAT expression an average 5-fold compared to uninduced K562 cells , when CAT expression was regulated by either full-length 5'HS2 , TNF-E2 , or the TAP-1 binding sites ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Correlation between Binding of NF-E2 and Erythroid-specific Gene Expression-Our experiments stemmed from the finding that the inducing agent hemin stimulates , whereas the inducing agent TPA inhibits , erythroid-specific gene expression in the multipotent human cell line K562 ( 4 , 5 , 8 ) .
We asked whether these inducing agents produced different patterns of transcription factor binding to the 5'HS2 enhancer sequence .
This sequence contains an NF-E2/AP-1 binding site found in the control elements of many genes that are expressed during erythroid differentiation .
We found that within the ubiquitously footprinted NF-E2/ tandem AP-1 recognition sequence , which has been shown to be required for 5HS2 enhancing activity , there is a cleavage sub-band that is unique to cells that do not express the erythroid phenotype .
The presence of this cleavage sub-band in the footprint generated by nuclear extracts obtained from cells that did not express the erythroid phenotype correlated with a lack of formation of an NF-E2-specific bandshift when we used a 31-bp oligonucleotide identical to this footprinted sequence in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Of most significance is the finding that nuclear extracts obtained from K562 cells induced with TPA for 72 h , which do not express the erythroid phenotype , did not generate the NF-E2-specific band at all , or , if the NF-E2 band was present , it was at least 4-fold diminished .
We believe the TPA-induced decrease in the binding of NF-E2 is not simply due to the TPA-induced increase in AP-1 factors that compete for access to the NF-E2/AP-1 binding site .
Our evidence for this hypothesis is our mobility shift data , which demonstrate that cold competitor DNA that binds AP-1 factors ; preventing them from competing with NF-E2 for binding to end-labeled probe does not restore the NF-E2 band when nuclear extracts from TPA-induced K562 cells are used in mobility shift assays .
It is possible that TPA induction either alters the affinity of NF- 5095 E2 for its binding site or decreases the amount of NF-E2 available for binding .
In preliminary experiments we find that nuclear extracts prepared from K562 cells induced for 30 min with TPA show increases in the amount of AP-1 factors but no change in NF-E2 when assayed by mobility shift .
This suggests that there is no immediate TPA-induced post-trans-lational modification of NF-E2 as there is for AP-1 factors .
When we checked for binding of NF-E2 to its recognition sequence in living cells , we again found evidence that NF-E2 bound to its recognition sequence only in cell lines that expressed the erythroid phenotype .
TPA-induced K562 cells , which do not express the erythroid phenotype , do not bind NF-E2 , in agreement with our mobility shift experiments .
Therefore , using DNase I footprinting , mobility shift assays , and in vivo methylation protection assays , we demonstrate that the inhibition of binding of the lineage limited transcription factor NF-E2 to its recognition site within 5'HS2 is correlated with the TPA-induced suppression of erythroid-specific gene expression .
Since the enhancer activity of 5HS2 is required for expression of genes within the -globin gene domain , it is possible that the loss of NF-E2 binding prevents the formation of an erythroid-specific transcription complex .
We do not believe that the TPA-induced inhibition of NF-E2 binding is unique to the NF-E2 binding site found within 5'HS2 .
Lumelsky and Forget ( 8 ) demonstrated that an enhancer element found 3 '' to the *y globin gene was required for the TPA-induced decrease in transcriptional initiation at the Ay promoter .
Like 5HS2 , the *y globin enhancer contains a sequence GCTGAGA that probably binds both NF-E2 or AP-1 factors .
These authors speculated that competition between NF-E2 and AP-1 factors for binding to this site might be the cause of the TPA-induced decrease in y globin transcriptional initiation in K562 cells .
Lumelsky and Forget ( 8 ) did test the effect of TPA on transcriptional initiation from a y globin promoter linked to 5'HS2 ( carried on an episome in K562 cells ) and found , in contradiction to their speculation , that TPA induction increased transcriptional initiation from this construct , which also contains a binding site for NF-E2 .
However , the rate of transcription from their uninduced 5'HS2-y globin promoter construct was much less than from their uninduced enhancerless y globin promoter , which suggests that their 5HS2 sequence was perhaps not a functional enhancer .
Complex Nature of Increases in Gene Expression Secondary to Hemin Induction in K562 Cells-Our mobility shift studies indicate that although hemin induction of K562 cells may increase the amount of NF-E2 per cell , hemin induction is not required for binding of NF-E2 to its recognition site because the NF-E2-specific mobility shift is generated by nuclear extracts obtained from uninduced K562 cells .
In K562 cells we find evidence , using in vivo methylation protection analysis , that NF-E2 binds to its perfect consensus binding sequence within in the absence of inducing levels of hemin .
We did not detect binding of NF-E2 in K562 cells to the near-perfect 8/9 consensus sequence .
Two other groups have published analyses of binding of transcription factors to 5'HS2 in cell lines .
All of the groups , including data published here , suggest that NF-E2 does not bind to the 8/9 consensus sequence for NF-E2 binding within However , Ikuta and Kan ( 30 ) state that hemin induction of K562 cells results in a change in the pattern of binding at the 5 NF-E2 site of 5'HS2 consistent with a hemin-induced binding of NF-E2 .
In contrast , Reddy and Shen ( 31 ) state that there is no change in the binding in vivo at the 5 NF-E2/tandem AP-1 site of 5'HS2 between uninduced , hemin , or TPA-induced K562 cells .
These disparate results may reflect differences in the 5096 endogenous levels of hemin synthesis in our various clones of K562 cells , and differences in the responsiveness of various clones of K562 cells to exposure to TPA .
In this report we do have agreement between our mobility shift data and in vivo 'data ; furthermore , we have found that our K562 cell line is responsive to TPA , because we do not detect any a globin mRNA after 72 h of exposure to TPA ( data not shown ) .
The results of our transient transfection assays more vividly demonstrate the complexity of the hemin-induced increases in gene expression in K562 cells .
Hemin induction of K562 cells transiently expressing the plasmids RSV luciferase or TAP-1 CAT , neither of which contain NF-E2 binding sites , consistently resulted in a severalfold induction of reporter gene expression as compared with uninduced K562 cells derived from the same electroporation .
Therefore , NF-E2 binding sites are not an absolute requirement for the hemin-induced increases in gene expression in K562 cells .
However , the hemin-induced increases in expression of plasmids not regulated by NF-E2 need not be at the level of transcriptional initiation .
Hemin is known to regulate protein translation , at least in reticulocyte lysates ( 27 ) , as well as the stability of some mRNAs ( 28 ) .
It is therefore possible that hemin induction increases the stabilities of CAT and luciferase mRNAs and/or their translations in K562 cells .
Since neither the CAT or luciferase mRNA has been reported to contain a hemin-responsive element , any hemin-induced increases in mRNA stabilities would be secondary to a generalized hemin-induced increase in mRNA stability in K562 cells .
To formally assess what proportion of hemin induction of expression from the plasmids RSV luciferase or TAP-1 CAT is at the level of transcriptional initiation versus mRNA stability or protein translation requires further study .
Our experimental design permits a direct assessment of the effect of hemin on the transcriptional initiation of plasmids containing NF-E2 binding sites .
The hemin-induced increase in expression of NF-E2 CAT was consistently 6-fold greater than the coelectroporated RSV luciferase plasmid , whereas the hemin-induced expression of the TAP-1 CAT plasmid was never greater than the coelectroporated RSV luciferase plasmid .
At a minimum , the presence of NF-E2 binding sites confers a 6-fold hemin-induced increase in the rate of initiation of transcription compared to plasmids that do not have NF-E2 binding sites .
The results obtained from our transient expression studies are in agreement with reports of an average 5-fold hemin-induced increase in steady state levels of endogenous y globin mRNA or mRNA produced from stably integrated plasmid vectors transcriptionally regulated by NF-E2 binding sites ( 7 , 15 ) .
The TPA-induced Decrease in Erythroid-specific Expression May Be Secondary to a Failure of Interaction between NF-E2 and Erythroid-specific Promoter Elements-Our results indicate that when 5HS2 or its NF-E2 binding site is linked to a promoter that binds general transcription factors , TPA-induced inhibition of NF-E2 binding paradoxically does not result in decreases in expression of transiently transfected reporter genes .
All our CAT reporter plasmids contained the SVA40 early promoter , a promoter that binds general transcription factors .
It is likely that our TPA-induced increases in CAT reporter gene expression is partly secondary to interac- Suppression of a Differentiation Program by Phorbol Ester tion between AP-1 factors binding at the NF-E2/AP-1 binding site and the ubiquitous transcription factors binding to the promoter .
Moi and Kan ( 29 ) demonstrated that overexpression of c-jun in K562 cells resulted in repression of expression from a transiently cotransfected luciferase reporter plasmid whose transcription was driven by 5HS2 and the erythroid-specific y globin promoter .
The difference between their result and our TPA-induced increase in reporter gene expression whose transcription was driven by 5'HS2 could be explained by a requirement for interaction between NF-E2 and transcription factors binding the erythroid-specific y globin promoter element .
NF-E2 binding within 5HS2 may therefore be required for the generation of an erythroid-specific transcription complex .
TPA induction of K562 cells , which does increase the amount of c-jun , as well as decrease the binding of NF-E2 , could disrupt the formation of an erythroid-specific transcription complex requiring the presence of NF-E2 .
Just which regulatory elements within the y promoter are interacting with the NF-E2/tandem AP-1 binding site within 5HS2 should be the subject of further endeavors .
