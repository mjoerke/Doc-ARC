Likewise , NF-AT1 mRNA and NF-AT4 mRNA have been detected in resting eosinophils , and their levels can be significantly up-regulated by the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 .
There is no detectable NF-AT protein expression in the nuclei of resting eosinophils .
However NF-ATs appear in the nuclei of IL-4- , IL-5- , or ionomycin-stimu-lated eosinophils .
Only NF-AT1 and NF-AT4 , but not NF-AT2 and NF-AT3 , have translocated into the nuclei in IL-4- or IL-5-stimulated eosinophils .
These findings delineate a novel pathway in the cytokine network in which Th2 lymphocytes `` con-trol '' eosinophils via the release of IL-4 and IL-5 , and activation of NF-AT in eosinophils .
The findings also suggest that a later feedback `` talking '' may exist between eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 163 : 21-24. uclear factor of activated T cells is a family of transcription factors implicated in the control of cytokine and early immune response gene expression .
NF-AT1-defi-cient mice are prone to developing a classically allergic phenotype characterized by eosinophilia and increased production of Th2-associated cytokines ( 1 ) .
Mice lacking NF-AT1 and NF-AT4 have allergic blepharitis , interstitial pneumonitis , and an increase in serum IgG1 and IgE levels , secondary to a selective increase in Th2-associated cytokines ( 2 ) .

Thus far , it has not been determined whether NF-AT proteins are expressed in eosinophils .
In the present study , we have investigated the expression of NF-AT proteins and the corresponding mRNA in peripheral eosinophils and the regulation of these proteins by IL-4 and IL-5 .
Materials and Methods Purification of eosinophils Eosinophils were purified from healthy , nonallergic volunteers as described in detail elsewhere ( 5 ) .
Briefly , a Percoll gradient ( 1.082 g/ml ; Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) was used to enrich eosinophils ; anti-CD16-coated MACS magnetic particles ( Miltenyi Biotech , Bergisch Gladbach , Ger-many ) were used to deplete neutrophils .
Eosinophil purity was invariably =97 % ( lymphocytes < 0.5 % ) .
The whole procedure was conducted at 4°C in a Ca '' * -free and Mg**-free medium .
Immunocytochemistry assay The purified eosinophils were spun down on a slide , fixed , and immersed in 1 % BSA blocking buffer for 10 min to avoid unspecific binding ; next , primary Ab ( 20 ug/ml of either anti-NF-AT1 ( mouse mAb 4G6-G5 ) , anti-NF-AT2 ( mouse mAb 7A6 ) , anti-NF-AT3 ( goat pAb° C-20 ) , or anti-NF-AT4 ( goat pAb C-20 ) ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) was added .
Eosinophils were then incubated overnight at 4°C , followed by the addition of secondary Ab , and were visualized by an alkaline phosphatase staining system ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) .
Real time quantitative RT-PCR assay All real time quantitative RT-PCRs were performed as described elsewhere ( 6 ) .
Briefly , total RNA was reverse transcribed and submitted to real time quantitative PCR in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector System ( Per-kin-Elmer , Norwalk , CT ) .
By using a SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents Kit ( Perkin-Elmer ) , fluorescence signals were generated during each PCR cycle via the 5 ' to 3 ' endonuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold to provide real time quantitative PCR information .
The following sequences of the specific primers ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Little Chalfont , U.K. ) were used : NF-AT1 sense , NF-AT1 antisense , 5'-TGGTTGCCCTCATGTTGTTTTT-3 ' ; NF-AT2 sense , CGCAGCACCCCTACCAGT-3 ' ; NF-AT2 antisense , 5'-TTCITTCCTC CCGATGTCCGTCTCT-3 ' ; NF-AT3 sense , 5-GGTTTCCCGGCCAGT CCAGGTCTA-3 ' ; NF-AT3 antisense , 5'-AAGGGGCGGGGAAGGAAG GAAACT-3 ' ; NF-AT4 sense , 5-ACCAGCCCGGGAGACTTCAATA GA-3 ' ; NF-AT4 antisense , 5'-AAATACCTGCACAATCAATACTGG-3 ' .

Distribution of NF-AT proteins in resting eosinophils .
Cells were stained with either anti-NF-AT1 ( A ) , anti-NF-AT2 ( B ) , anti-NF-AT3 ( C ) , anti-NF-AT4 ( D ) , isotype mouse IgG2a ( £ ) , or goat serum ( F ) .
The eosinophils were cytoplasmically stained with Abs of mouse anti-NF-AT1 ( A ) and goat anti-NF-AT4 ( D ) , respectively .
The arrow in B indicates a contaminating T lymphocyte ( morphologically identified ) that was very seldom seen in the preparations ( < 0.5 % ) .
This unique cell has been considered as a good internal positive control .
Cells were photographed under X400 magnification .
The target cDNA was adjusted to amounts equal to those of the housekeeping gene ( G-actin ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
PCRs were optimized under the following conditions : 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C with 40 cycles for each amplification .
To express the results , two terms were used : AR , , representing the normalized reporter signal minus the baseline signal established in the first few cycles PCR , and C ; ( thresh-old cycle ) , representing the PCR cycle at which an increase in reporter fluorescence signal above a baseline can first be detected .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by McCaffrey et al .
and Aram-buru et al .
( 7 , 8 ) .
Briefly , 400 ul of ice-cold Dignam buffer A and then 25 jl of 10 % Nonidet P-40 were added into the cells .
The cells were vortexed and centrifuged ( 9000 rpm , 30 s , 4°C ) .
Pelleted nuclei were lysed in 50 ul of Dignam buffer C and centrifuged ( 12,000 rpm , 10 min , 4°C ) ; the resulting supernatants were diluted ( 1/1 ) with Dignam buffer D. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide DNA probes were end-labeled with [ y- > P ] ATP ( 5000 Ci/mmol ) and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) .
The sequences of the oligonucleotide probes used ( 5 ' to 3 ' , one strand ) were as follows ( 9 , 10 ) : human IL-2 distal NF-AT site ( NF-AT hullL-2 ) , GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGG ( binding sequences are underlined ) ; consensus AP-1 site , CGCTTGATGACT CAGCCGGAA .
EMSA reactions were performed at room temperature in a final volume of 25 ul .
Nuclear extracts ( 3 ug of protein per reaction volume ) were incubated for 15 min in binding buffer ( 8 ) , followed by the addition of 0.5 ng P-labeled probes to react for 15 min ; next , the samples were electrophoresed on nondenatured 5 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 Tris-borate-EDTA ( TBE ) buffer .
In some experiments , cold probes used as competitors were added at the beginning of the reaction to identical aliquots of the extracts ( 100-fold higher than labeled probes ) .
The mAbs used for supershift ( all at 10 ug/ml ) were incubated with the nuclear extracts on ice for 30 min .

NF-AT4 mRNA have also been significantly up-regulated in the IL-4- and IL-5-stimulated eosinophils ( Fig .

There are ~3.0 X 10° copies and ~4.4 X 10° copies for NF-AT4 , respectively .
A linear relationship between C ; and log starting quantity of the standard DNA template or target cDNA ( NF-AT1 and NF-AT4 ) has been detected ( Fig .

We have also observed that NF-AT1 , NF-AT2 , NF-AT3 , and NF-AT4 have been expressed in purified T lymphocytes , and their expression can be up-regulated by IL-4 and IL-5 , respectively ( data not shown ) .
IL-4- and IL-5-induced activation of NF-AT in eosinophils There is no detectable NF-AT in the nuclei of resting eosinophils .
NF-AT hulL-2 binding proteins have been detected in the nuclei of IL-4- or IL-5-stimulated ( 1 h ) eosinophils , which indicates that IL-4 and IL-5 can induce NF-AT activation , resulting a translocation of NF-AT in eosinophils ( Fig .

- Kinetics of NF-AT activation in IL-4- and IL-5-stimulated eosinophils and identification of NF-AT1 in the nuclei of eosinophils .
Eosinophils were freshly isolated ( None ) , stimulated in medium ( None ) , or stimulated with IL-4 or IL-5 for the indicated time intervals .
Kinetics of NFE-AT activation and AP-1 were assessed by EMSA using a *°P-labeled NF-AT hulL-2 probe ( A ) or an AP-1 probe ( B ) .
C , Eosinophils were freshly isolated ( None ) or stimulated with IL-4 or IL-5 .
Identification of the presence of NF-AT1 and NF-AT2 was done by using mAb ( s ) toward NF-AT1 and/or NF-AT2 and EMSA in supershift assays as described in Materials and Methods .
Before the addition of a °°P-labeled NF-AT hulL-2 probe , identical aliquots of samples were incubated without ( - ) or with isotype mouse IgG ( i ) , mouse anti-human NF-AT1 mAb ( 1 ) , mouse anti-human NF-AT2 mAb ( 2 ) , or NF-AT1 mAb plus NF-AT2 mAb ( 1.2 ) .

molar excess of the cold NF-AT hulL-2 probe , whereas no competition is induced by the cold AP-1 site probe .
A 100-fold molar excess of the cold AP-1 site probe can completely and specifically compete the °°P-labeled AP-1 probe ( Fig .
3B ) .
It is not clear why the cold AP-1 site probe does not compete the NF-AT hulL-2 probe in our experiments , because the binding complex probably contains both NF-AT and AP-1 ( 8 , 9 ) .
NF-AT translocation into the nuclei of IL-4- and IL-5-stimulated eosinophils has been detected within 15 min and lasts for =120 min ( Fig .

In the current study , AP-1 was seen in freshly isolated eosinophils ; increased activity of AP-1 in nuclei of eosinophils after stimulation 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 24 ( ? )

with IL-4 or IL-5 was observed for 120 min ( Fig .
4B ) .
NF-AT1 complex was supershifted by the mouse anti-NF-AT1 mAb ( Fig .
4C ) .
Neither isotype mouse IgG nor mouse anti-NF-AT2 mAb can affect the relative mobility of the NF-AT complex .
These results confirm the presence of NF-AT1 , but not NF-AT2 , in the nuclei of IL-4- or IL-5-activated eosinophils .
Likewise , the presence of NF-AT4 , but not NF-AT3 , in the nuclei of IL-4- or IL-S-activated eosinophils has also been confirmed ( data not shown ) .
The mechanism by which IL-4 and IL-5 induce the appearance of NF-AT 's in the nuclei of eosinophils is unknown , because the cytokines are not known to induce a Ca** influx , which is thought to be necessary for nuclear translocation of NF-AT .
It will be of interest to further investigate this mechanism .
In Fig .
4C , it appears that the entire band is supershifted with anti-NF-AT1 .
This finding seems to be in contrast to the conclusions for NF-AT4 .
The reason for this phenomenon may be that the NF-AT4 content in eosinophils is so small that the NF-AT1 band overlaps the NF-AT4 band .
In mice lacking NF-AT1 , resulting an in vivo model of allergic inflammation , an increased pleural accumulation of eosinophils and serum IgE levels and an abnormal pattern of IL-4 gene expression are seen ( 11 , 12 ) .
The eosinophilia and high levels of serum IgE in these mice are apparently dependent upon the overproduction of IL-4 and IL-5 ( 1 ) .
Mice lacking NF-AT4 have impaired development of CD4 and CD8 single-positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as hyperactivation of peripheral T cells ( 13 ) .
Our findings mentioned above suggest that the NF-AT family play a critical role in inducible gene transcription during the immune response , especially in the allergic response .
Our results show that eosinophils , one of the key cells in allergic inflammation , may not only be a passive target for the deficiency , dysfunc-tion , or inactivation of the NF-AT family in Th2 lymphocytes , but may also be an active regulator during the initiation , development , limitation , and termination of allergic inflammation .
Kiani et al .
demonstrated that NF-AT1 is also involved in down-regulating the late phase of IL-4 gene transcription-inhibiting Th2 CUTTING EDGE responses .
This is evidence that NF-AT proteins regulate not only the initiation but also the termination of gene transcription ( 14 ) .
Our results are in support of this observation in light of the biological functions of eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes .
Based on our results , we might propose that NF-AT could be deficient or genetically inactivated in certain circumstances such as allergic conditions .
A challenge such as allergen stimulation initiates a cascade of events of allergic inflammation , including overproduction of IL-4 and IL-5 , activation of eosinophils , and eosinophilia .
An over-release of IL-4 and IL-5 could subsequently activate NF-AT in eosinophils .
The cascade of biological events in eosinophils after NF-AT activation would result in later feedback `` talking '' to Th2 lymphocytes to induce secondary activation of NF-AT in the Th2 lymphocytes ( may also be other types of immune cells ) .
This later feedback talking could lead to the termination of allergic disorders .
A schematic view for this proposal is illustrated in Fig .
5 .
It will be quite interesting to investigate the exact mechanism of the secondary activation of NF-AT in Th2 lymphocytes during the later feedback talking on the pathway in the cytokine network between eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes , especially in cells from allergic subjects .
