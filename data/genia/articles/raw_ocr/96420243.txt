Interleukin-6 Promotes Multiple Myeloma Cell Growth Via Phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma Protein By Mitsuyoshi Urashima , Atsushi Ogata , Dharminder Chauhan , Maria B. Vidriales , Gerrard Teoh , Yasutaka Hoshi , Robert L. Schlossman , James A. DeCaprio , and Kenneth C. Anderson interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) mediates autocrine and paracrine growth of multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells and inhibits tumor cell apoptosis .
Abnormalities of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) and mutations of RB gene have been reported in up to 70 % of MM patients and 80 % of MM-derived cell lines .
Because dephosphorylated ( activated ) pRB blocks transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle whereas phosphorylated ( inactivated ) pRB releases this growth arrest , we characterized the role of pRB in IL-6-mediated MM cell growth .
Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pRB were expressed in all serum-starved MM patient cells and MM-derived cell lines , but pRB was predominantly in its phosphorylated form .
In MM cells that proliferated in response to IL-6 , exogenous IL-6 downregulated dephosphorylated pRB and decreased dephosphorylated pRB-E2F complexes .
Importantly , culture of MM cells with RB antisense , but not RB sense , oligonucleotide ( ODN ) triggered IL-6 secretion and proliferation in MM NTERLEUKIN-6 ( IL-6 ) is a cytokine with pleiotropic activities , including induction of differentiation and regulation of growth in a cell type dependent manner . ''
It was originally described as a factor that promoted differentiation of normal B cells to antibody ( Ab ) producing cells , without triggering B-cell proliferation . ''
In contrast , IL-6 is known to be a growth factor both for human multiple myeloma ( MM ) and mouse plasmacytoma cells .
Specifically , multiple reports support an autocrine IL-6-mediated growth mechanism in MM , as some MM cells and derived cell lines both produce and respond to IL-6 in vitro .
* '' '' An IL-6-mediated paracrine growth mechanism has also been postulated , based on these observations : bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) are the major source of IL-6 in MM '' ; freshly isolated MM cells cultured without exogenous IL-6 rapidly stop pro-liferating'* ; and adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs upregulates IL-6 secretion by BMSCs . '' '' '' ''
Most recently , IL-6 has also been shown to enhance survival of MM cells , because it can inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells induced by corticosteroids , '' serum starvation , ' '' '' and anti-Fas . ''
There is also considerable evidence supporting a role for IL-6 in the growth and manifestations of MM in vivo : elevated IL-6 serum levels correlate with poor prognosis and higher tumor cell mass in MM ; IL-6 transgenic mice develop histopathologic changes characteristic of MM kidney ; IL-6 serves an as osteoclast activating factor in MM bone disease ; and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) therapy can transiently reverse disease manifestations in patients with MM .
*** Despite this central role for IL-6 in MM cell growth , some patient MM cells and derived cell lines that bear IL-6 receptors grow independently of IL-6 .
Moreover , although overproduction of IL-6 in vivo can occur in MM , it is also observed in other diseases including rheumatoid arthritis , Castleman 's disease , mesangial proliferative glomerulone-phritis , and cardiac myxoma . ''
Patients with these diseases do not develop MM , suggesting that additional factors are essential for MM pathogenesis .
Studies in animals suggest that genetic abnormalities , which result in a pathological response to IL-6 , may be required for development of MM .
Blood , Vol 88 , No 6 ( September 15 ) , 1996 : pp 2219-2227 cells ; however , proliferation was only partially inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) .
in contrast to MM cells , normai splenic B cells express dephosphorylated pRB .
Although CD40 ligand ( CD4OL ) triggers a shift from dephosphorylated to phosphorylated pRB and proliferation of B cells , the addition of exogenous IL-6 to CD40L-treated B cells does not alter either pRB or proliferation , as observed in MM cells .
These results suggest that phosphorylated pRB is constitutively expressed in MM cells and that IL-6 further shifts pRB from its dephosphorylated to its phosphorylated form , thereby promoting MM cell growth via two mechanisms : by decreasing the amount of E2F bound by dephosphorylated pRB due to reduced dephosphorylated pRB , thereby releasing growth arrest ; and by upregulating IL-6 secretion by MM cells and related IL-6-mediated autocrine tumor cell growth .

For example , plasmacytomas can grow in wild type mice , but not in IL-6 knock out littermates , '' confirming the essential role of IL-6 .
However , C57BL/6 IL-6 transgenic mice develop massive plasmacytosis without plasmacytomas , '' '' whereas BALB/C IL-6 transgenic mice develop transplant able monoclonal plasmacytomas . '' ''
These animal studies confirm that IL-6 can enhance susceptibility to either plasmacytosis and Ab formation or the development and growth of plasmacytomas , depending on the genetic background .
Mutations of the retinoblastoma ( RB ) gene contribute to cellular transformation in many types of malignancies .
Specifically , normal retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) suppresses the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle '' * '' ° by inhibiting E2F-mediated transactivation of a variety of genes involved in initiating DNA synthesis , ie , c-myc , b-myb , cdc2 , dihydrofolate reductase , and thymidine kinase . ''
pRB function is regulated by phosphorylation : hypo or dephosphorylated ( activated ) pRB binds E2F and induces G1 growth arrest ; in contrast , phosphorylated ( inactivated ) pRB can not bind E2F , thereby facilitating entry of cells into S phase . ''
To date mutations in RB gene or abnormalities in pRB have been noted in up to 70 % of MM patients and 80 % of MM-derived cell lines . '' ''

2220 reported that transforming growth factor ( TGF /3 ) does not suppress phosphorylation of pRB and proliferation of MM cells , '' as occurs in normal B cells , consistent with the view that pRB may contribute to MM cell growth .
In this regard , it is known that the majority of MM cells and derived cell lines express IL-6 receptors , and yet only a subset are dependent on IL-6 for growth '' '' ; it is , therefore , possible that abnormalities in cell cycle regulatory proteins , ie , RB , may contribute to MM cell growth and progressive disease .
In the present report , we characterized the role of pRB in IL-6-mediated MM cell growth .
Although both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pRB were expressed in all serum-starved MM patient cells and MM-derived cell lines , pRB was predominantly in its phosphorylated form .
Exogenous IL-6 downregulated dephosphorylated pRB and decreased dephosphorylated pRB to E2F complexes in MM cells , Culture of MM cells with RB antisense , but not RB sense , oligonucleotide ( ODN ) triggered IL-6 secretion and proliferation in MM cells ; the latter was partially inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-6 MoAb .
These results suggest that both dephosphorylated and phosphorylated pRB are present , and that the former induces growth arrest , even though the latter predominates .
However , in IL-6-responsive MM cells , IL-6 further shifts pRB from its dephosphorylated to its phosphorylated form , thereby promoting MM cell growth via two mechanisms : by decreasing binding of dephosphorylated pRB to E2F and releasing growth arrest , and by upregulating IL-6 secretion by MM cells and IL-6-mediated autocrine tumor cell growth .
MATERIALS AND METHODS MM cells and MM-derived cell lines .
- Mononuclear cells ( MCs ) were isolated from three patients with MM by Ficoll-Hypaque ( FH ) density gradient centrifugation , incubated with HB7 ( anti-CD38 ) MoAb-biotin-streptavidin and 2H4 ( anti-CD45RA ) MoAb-fluores-cein isothiocyanate on ice .
MM cells ( 96 % + 2 % CD38* were isolated using an Epics C Cell Sorter ( Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) , washed , and resuspended in RPMI-1640 media ( Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis , MO ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , L-glutamine ( L-glu ) ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) , 100 U/mL penicillin ( pen ) , and 100 ug/mL streptomycin ( strep ) ( GIBCO ) .
The ARH-77 , IM-9 , RPMI-8226 , and U-266 human MM-derived cell lines ' were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Rock-ville , MD ) .
The XG-1 IL-6-dependent MM cell line was kindly provided by Dr Bernard Klein ( Institute for Molecular Genetics , Montpellier , France ) and cultured in media with 1 ng/mL of IL-6 ( Kirin-Brewrey Co Ltd , Minato-ku , Tokyo , Japan ) . ''
The U-1958 '' and OCI-My5® MM cell lines were kindly provided by Drs Kenneth Nilsson ( Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden ) and H.A .
Messner ( Ontario Cancer Institute , Toronto , Ontario , Canada ) .
The JKB acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line ( ALL ) , '' an IL-6 nonresponsive cell line , and the CMK acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell line , '' '' * '' which grows in an IL-6-mediated autocrine fashion , were used as controls for the MM cells/MM derived cell lines .
B-cell preparation and culture .
- Normal spleen ( n = 5 ) was obtained from operative specimens of patients not known to have any systemic or malignant diseases .
Single cell suspensions from spleen were prepared by extrusion through sterile stainless steel mesh .
Splenic MC 's were isolated by centrifugation on FH density sedimen-tation , and adherent cells removed from MCs by double adherence to plastic petri dishes for 1 hour at 37°C .
Further enrichment for B cells in spleen was done by rosetting with sheep red blood cells to URASHIMA ET AL deplete T cells .
B cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media containing 10 % FBS , L-glu , and pen/strep , as previously described . ''
Splenic B cells , which were B1 > 90 % ( ++ ) , B2 > 85 % ( ++ ) , CD38 negative , PCA-1 negative , gp 80 and gp130 IL-6 receptor ( IL-6R ) negative ( n = 3 ) , were cultured with soluble CD4O0L ( 1:4 dilution ) for 7 days to trigger their differentiation to 8 % BI ( + ) , B2 negative , 85 % CD38 ( ++ ) , 47 % PCA-1 ( ++ ) , 22 % gp80 ( + ) , and 55 % gp130 ( ++ ) , as in previous studies . ''
Assays of DNA synthesis .
- DNA synthesis was measured as previously described . ''
Cells ( 2 X 10 % /well ) were incubated in 96-well plates in the presence of media , IL-6 or CD4O0L , and DNA synthesis measured using *H-thymidine ( °H-TdR ) uptake .
Cells were pulsed with °H-TdR ( 1 Ci/well ) during the last 6 hours of 2-day and last 18 hours of 4-day cultures , harvested onto glass filters with an automatic cell harvester ( Cambridge Technology , Cambridge , MA ) , and counted on a liquid scintillation counter ( Packard Tri-Carb 4530 , Downers Grove , IL ) .
Stimulation index ( SD ) was calculated as °H-TdR uptake of cells with uptake of cells with media alone .
Immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting .
- Immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting were performed as previously reported . '' ''
For immunoprecipitation ( IP ) of pRB , as well as E2F , cells ( 1 X 10 '' cells/sample ) were cultured in RPMI-1640 media without FBS for 48 hours .
These cells were then harvested before , as well as at 30 and 240 minutes after , culture with IL-6 ( 100 ng/ mL ) .
Cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and lysed for 30 minutes at 4°C in buffer : 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI ( pH 7.6 ) , 150 mmol/L NaCl , 0.5 % Noidet P-40 , 5 mmol/L EDTA , 1 mmol/L PMSF , 200 mmol/L Na , ; VO,4 , aprotinin , and 1 mmol/L NaF .
Murine anti-pRB MoAb ( Oncogene Science , Union-dale , NY ) or rabbit anti-E2F polyclonal Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol-ogy , Santa Cruz CA ) was added and incubated overnight at 4°C .
Proteins were collected using protein G sepharose for murine Ab or protein A sepharose for rabbit Ab .
Aliquots of each lysate were analyzed by 5.0 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) .
Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane , and nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5 % skim milk .
The membrane was probed with anti-pRB or with murine anti-E2F ( Santa Cruz ) MoAb , incubated with antimouse Ig Abs conjugated with horse radish peroxidase ( HRP ) ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) , and detected using the enhanced chemilumi-nescence ( ECL ) system ( Amersham ) .
Sense and antisense oligonucleotides .
_ A 15-base antisense ODN specific for a sequence of RB gene ( 5'-GGT TTT GGG CGG CAT-3 ' ) previously effective in enhancing growth in keratinocytes , '' as well as complementary sense ODN ( 5'-ATG CCG CCC AAA ACC-3 ' ) , was added to cultures of MM cells .
ODNs were synthesized by cyanoethyl phosphoramide methodology , purified by Sephadex column and ethanol precipitation , and resuspended in sterile water .
They were added to MM cell cultures at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 pmol/L and replenished daily .
Proliferation and IL-6 secretion were measured in MM cultures with RB sense or RB antisense ODN , in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-IL-6 MoAb .
Measurement of IL-6 secretion .
- IL-6 secretion by MM patient cells cultured in media or in the presence of RB sense or RB antisense ODNs was measured using an Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , as previously described . '' ''
Briefly , ( 1 ) 96-well plates ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) were coated with anti-IL-6 MoAb ( mu-rine IgG1L , Toray , Ohtsu-shi , Shiga , Japan ) ; ( 2 ) wells were saturated with calfskin gelatin ( BioRad , Melville , NY ) -PBS for 1 hour ; ( 3 ) serial dilutions ( 100 gL ) of test sample supernatants were added in duplicate to plates ; and ( 4 ) biotinylated detector anti-IL-6 MoAb ( Genetics Institute , Cambridge , MA ) was added and developed with avidin-peroxidase ( Amersham ) , tetramethylbenzidine ( Sigma ) , and From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Reagents .
IL-6 ( Kirin-Brewrey Co Ltd ) was added to cultures of patient MM cells , MM or other cell lines , as well as B cells , and the effects on cell proliferation and phosphorylation state of pRB were assayed .
Anti-IL-6 MoAb ( Genetics Institute ) or unreactive isomatched ( IgG1 ) control MoAb ( Coulter ) was added to cultures of MM cells with RB sense or antisense ODN .
Soluble CD40L was kindly provided by Dr Diane Hollenbaugh ( Bristol-Myers Squibb , Seattle , WA ) .
Briefly , CD4O0L gene was transfected into COS cells and supernatants harvested and characterized as previously described . ''
Soluble CD40L was used at a final concentration of 1:4 dilution , previously shown to trigger splenic B-cell proliferation . ''
RESULTS Effects of IL-6 on DNA synthesis by MM cells/MM-derived cell lines , B cells , and CD4OL-treated B cells .
MM patient cells/ MM cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 media free of FBS .
DNA synthesis was measured using °H-TdR uptake during the last 6 hours of day 2 cultures ( Table 1 ) .
Proliferation of IL-6-dependent XG-1 cells and of patient MM cells was directly correlated with IL-6 concentration .
For XG-1 cells and MM cells from patients 1 , 2 , and 3 , culture with 100 ng/mL of IL-6 increased °H-TdR uptake : SI 5.4 P < 005 , SIT 4.6 P < .005 , SI 3.3 P < .005 , and 25.4 P < .001 , respectively .
IL-6 ( 100 ng/mL ) also stimulated low level but reproducible proliferation of other MM cell lines : SI 1.6 P < .05 , SI 1.6 P < .01 , and SI 1.9 P < .01 for U-266 , U-1958 , and OCI-My5 MM cells , respectively .
Significant proliferation of RPMI-8226 , IM-9 , and ARH-77 MM cells to IL-6 was not observed under any conditions .
The CMK megakaryocytic cell line also proliferated in response to IL-6 ( 100 ng/mL ) ( SI 1.9 P < .01 ) .
In contrast , JKB ALL cells did not increase DNA synthesis in response to IL-6 .
CD4O0L stimulated proliferation of splenic B cells ( SI : 3.1 , P < .05 ) , but IL-6 did not alter *H-TdR uptake in either splenic B cells or CD40L-treated splenic B cells ( data not shown ) .
Effects of IL-6 on phosphorylation of pRB in MM patient cells/MM cell lines , B cells , and CD4OL-treated B cells .
The effect of IL-6 on phosphorylation state of pRB was investigated using immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting .
Phosphorylation slows electrophoretic mobility ; therefore , the upper ( 115 kD ) band corresponds to phosphor ylated pRB and the lower ( 105 kD ) band to de- or hypophos-phorylated pRB .
Multiple bands between 105 kD and 115 kD represent several forms of pRB that are phosphorylated at different sites or with different stoichiometry . ''
Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pRB were ob-served , at 115 kD and 105 kD respectively , in all MM patient cells and MM-derived cell lines after serum starvation for 48 hours ; however , phosphorylated pRB was predominant ( Fig 1A ) .
Even after serum starvation for 72 hours , phosphorylated pRB was strongly expressed at 115 kD in MM cell lines ( data not shown ) .
Culture with IL-6 ( 100 ng/mL ) led to downregulation of dephosphorylated pRB in MM patient cells and MM cell lines in several patterns .
In XG-1 , U-266 , OCI-My-5 , and patient !
MM cells , as well as CMK leukemia cells , dephosphorylated pRB expression declined in lysates from cells cultured with IL-6 for 30 and 240 minutes .
In contrast , dephosphorylated pRB expression persisted at 30 minutes and declined only at 240 minutes in cell lysates of U-1958 and patient 2 MM cells cultured with IL-6 .
In ARH-77 , RPMI-8226 , and IM-9 MM cells , there were several pRB bands in addition to phosphorylated pRB at 115 kD ; IL-6 increased phosphorylated pRB and decreased dephosphorylated pRB in these MM cell lines .
In contrast , pRB in JKB ALL cells was constitutively phosphorylated and unaffected by culture with IL-6 .
pRB expression in splenic B cells cultured in media or triggered with CD4O0L was compared with that in MM cells .
pRB in splenic B cells was predominantly in the dephosphorylated form ( Fig 1B ) .
In contrast to MM cells ( Fig 1A ) , treatment with IL-6 did not alter pRB phosphorylation state in B cells .
CD4OL upregulated phosphorylated pRB at 115 kD and downregulated dephosphorylated pRB at 105 kD in splenic B cells ( Fig 1B ) ; IL-6 had no effect on pRB phosphorylation in CD4OL-treated B cells .
Effects of IL-6 on binding of pRB to E2F protein in MM patient cells/MM cell lines .
Because dephosphorylated pRB directly binds E2F and the complex of pRB and EZF binds to a variety of gene promotors resulting in growth arrest , we determined whether downregulation of dephosphorylated pRB in MM cells correlates with pRB decreased binding to EZF protein ( Fig 2 ) .

sion , proliferation and IL-6 secretion by MM cells from three patients were next examined .
Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pRB expression decreased in lysates of cells cultured for 4 days in the presence of RB antisense ODN , but not RB sense ODN ( Fig 3A ) .
Proliferation , assessed by ' H-TdR uptake , was significantly increased in the presence of RB antisense ODN ( 10 umol/L ) relative to cultures in media for patient 1 ( P < .02 , n = 4 ) , patient 2 ( P < .02 , n = 4 ) , and patient 3 ( P < .005 , n = 3 ) ( Fig 3B ) .
In contrast , culture with RB sense ODN did not alter proliferation compared with cultures in media alone .
The effects of culture with RB sense and antisense ODNs on IL-6 secretion by the same patient MM cells were assayed using an IL-6 ELISA ( Fig 3C ) .
IL-6 secretion by MM cells in media was 0.27 + 0.04 ng/mL ( patient 1 ) , 0.13 + 0.01 ng/mL ( patient 2 ) , and 0.08 + 0.02 ng/mL ( patient 3 ) .
When MM cells were cultured with 10 of RB antisense ODN , IL-6 secretion increased to 1.21 + 0.16 ng/mL ( patient 1 ) , 0.72 + 0.12 ng/mL ( patient 2 ) , and 1.33 + 0.15 ng/mL ( patient XG-1 Control U-266 OCI-My5 Patient 1 IL-6 IL-6 -+ 3 ) , significantly greater than by MM cells cultured in media alone ( P < .01 for patients 1 and 2 , and P < .001 for patient 3 ) or by MM cells cultured with 10 Lmol/L RB sense ODN ( P < .05 for patients 1 and 2 and P < .01 for patient 3 ) .
At concentrations of RB antisense ODN =1 pmol/L , no significant differences in either proliferation or IL-6 secretion by MM cells were observed ( data not shown ) .
Effects of anti-IL-6 MoAb on MM cell proliferation triggered by RB antisense ODN .
We next examined whether the increased proliferation of MM cells observed in RB antisense cultures was , at least in part , mediated by IL-6 .
IL-6 responsive patient MM cells were cultured for 4 days with RB antisense or RB sense ODN , in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-IL-6 MoAb .
IL-6 ( 10 ng/mL ) markedly increased proliferation of patient MM cells : SI 32.2 at day 4 in 10 % FBS RPMI-1640 media , a response that was significantly blocked ( 73 % reduction , P < .001 , n = 3 ) by neutralizing anti-IL-6 MoAb ( 10 ug/mL ) , but not by control MoAb ( Fig 4A ) .

However , at day 4 of culture , RB antisense ODN significantly increased MM cell proliferation , compared with cultures in media alone ( 12.7-fold , P < .001 , n = 3 ) or with RB sense ODN ( 14.1-fold , P < .001 , n = 3 ) .
Neutralizing anti-IL-6 MoAb , but not control MoAb , partially inhibited proliferation triggered by RB antisense ODN ( 42.2 % reduction , P < 02 , n = 3 ) .
DISCUSSION IL-6 is known to be both an autocrine and paracrine growth factor , as well as an antiapoptotic factor , for MM cells .
Recent studies that show that retroviruses containing mye and raf oncogenes induce plasmacytomas in pristane-injected wild type , but not in IL-6 knock out , mice '' support this central role of IL-6 in the growth and development of plasma cell tumors .
However , plasmacytosis without monoclonal plamacytomas develops in IL-6 transgenic B6 mice , '' ° whereas monoclonal transplantable plamacytomas occur in IL-6 transgenic BALB/c mice , demonstrating the import of genetic background on the biologic sequelae of excess IL-6 . ''
Moreover , in man , excess production of IL-6 is associated with a variety of diseases other than plamacytomas or MM , ie , cardiac myxomas , autoimmune conditions , and Castleman 's disease , ' further suggesting the importance of other genetic factors .
In human MM , IL-6 triggers proliferation of tumor cells and is , therefore , a growth factor ; however , not all MM cells and MM cell lines that bear IL-6 receptors respond to exogenous IL-6 , and some can grow independently of IL-6 .
Recent studies have shed insight into potential differences in IL-6 signaling cascades in MM cells that proliferate and those that do not in response to IL-6 .
For example , our recent studies suggest that IL-6 triggers activation of the STAT 3 homodimer and STAT1-STAT3 heterodimer cascades without altering DNA synthesis of MM cells , whereas IL-6 triggers MM cell growth via the Ras dependent MAPK cas-cade . ''
Clearly differences in IL-6 signal transduction cascades may underly the triggering by IL-6 of growth of MM cells versus differentiation of normal B cells , as well as the growth of only a subset of tumor cells .
In the present study , we set out to delineate the importance of the RB cell cycle regulatory protein , as abnormalities of Fig 3 .
Effect of RB antisense and sense ODNs on pRB expression proliferation and IL-6 secretion in patient MM cells .

| Effect of anti-IL-6 MoAb on MM cell proliferation triggered by RB antisense ODN .
( A ) Patient MM cells ( 1 x 10°/mL ) were cultured in media alone ( 0 ) ; with IL-6 { 10 ng/ml ) ( @ ) ; with IL-6 plus control MoAb ( U ) ; and with IL-6 and anti-IL-6 MoAb ( M ) .
( B ) Patient MM cells were cultured in media alone ( O ) ; with RB antisense ODN ( 10 pmol/L ) ( @ ) ; with RB sense ODN { 10 gmol/L ) ( D ) ; with RB antisense ODN ( 10 umol/ L } and anti-lL-6 MoAb ( M ) ; as well as with RB antisense ODN and control MoAb ( A ) .
in all cases , DNA synthesis was measured using °H-TdR uptake during the last 18 hours of 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , and 120-hour cultures .
ODNs and MoAbs were replenished daily .
Data shown are mean + SD from three independent experiments and were compared using two sample t tests .
These are monoalleic deletions and pRB , the product of RB gene , can be detected .
In contrast , bialleic deletion of RB gene and absence of pRB was reported in U-266 MM cells , which both produce and respond to IL-6 ( autocrine growth ) , but not in parental U-266 cells , which respond but do not produce IL-6 ( paracrine growth ) .
`` * '' '' Interestingly either partial or complete deletions of chromosome 13 , on which RB gene is located , or abnormalities involving 11q , on which bel-1 is located , are frequent and associated with poor prognosis in MM .
** Moreover , cyclin D1 , which can trigger phosphorylation of pRB , is located on the 110 kb telomeric of the bel-1 major translocation cluster region ; its overex-pression has been reported in various kinds of cancers with 11q abnormalites , such as mantle cell lymphoma . ''
In the current study , pRB was shown to be expressed both in patient MM cells and MM-derived cell lines , primarily in its phosphorylated form .
Although serum starvation for 72 hours both decreased growth and increased expression of dephosphorylated pRB , phosphorylated pRB persisted .
This is in contrast to normal splenic B cells in which pRB is dephos-phorylated , with complete absence of phosphorylated pRB .
Complexes of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4 , CDK 6 , and cyclin D , and of CDK 2 and cyclin E regulate pRB phosphorylation '' ; however , the mechanism whereby MM cells express primarily phosphorylated RB has not yet been delineated .
In our study , pRB was primarily in its phosphorylated form in MM cells/MM-derived cell lines ; IL-6 triggered tumor cell proliferation and downregulation of dephosphory- lated pRB .
In contrast , dephosphorylated pRB was present in B cells ; CD40L induced proliferation and decreased dephosphorylated pRB expression .
These observations suggest that dephosphorylated pRB , rather than phosphorylated pRB , affects B and MM cell proliferation .
Dephosphorylated pRB binds E2F and the complex induces G1 growth arrest by inhibiting transcription of genes regulating cell replication . ''
In our study , dephosphorylated pRB bound E2F protein in MM cells under conditions of serum starvation , whereas complexes of pRB-EZF decreased in the presence of IL-6 , further confirming that IL-6 downregulates dephosphorylated pRB .
Moreover , in the XG-1 IL-6-dependent MM cell line , phosphorylated pRB expression persisted in the absence of IL-6 , although dephosphorylated pRB increased and growth decreased .
These data suggest that IL-6 promotes MM cell proliferation by triggering pRB phosphorylation , thereby decreasing complexes of dephosphorylated pRB with E2F and allowing entry into the cell cycle , as expected .
In previous studies of mouse M1 leukemia cells , IL-6 has been found to trigger dephosphorylation of pRB , decrease proliferation , and enhance differentiation , further demonstrating that IL-6 can mediate biologic sequelae via its effects on RB phosphorylation state . '' ''
Our studies show that RB antisense , but not RB sense , ODN induced both IL-6 secretion and proliferation in patient MM cells .
In this setting , the resultant reduced amounts of pRB , including dephosphorylated pRB , facilitate entry into the cell cycle as mentioned above .
However , a component of the proliferation noted in RB antisense ODN-treated MM From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .
For personal use only .
2226 cells in our study was blocked by neutralizing MoAb to IL-6 .
These studies , therefore , suggest that inactivation of RB can contribute to autocrine IL-6-mediated growth in MM .
Although not directly examined in this study , the increased IL-6 secretion induced by RB antisense ODN treatment of MM cells may be attributed , at least in part , to increased IL-6 transcription as it has been reported that wild type , but not mutated , RB can repress c-fos expression and AP-1 transcription activity in NIH3T3 cells via binding to a cis element ( RB control element or RCE ) in the c-fos promoter . ''
RCE is highly analogous to a region between -126 and -101 of the IL-6 promoter , and pRB binds directly to IL-6 promoter and represses transcription . '' '' '' '' '' ''
In addition , MacLead et al '' '' observed nuclear proteins in MM cell lines that were able to bind to NFB , NF-IL-6 , and AP-1 response elements and whose quantity positively correlated with IL-6 production by these cells .
These and the current studies suggest that phosphorylated ( inactivated ) pRB in MM , due to its inability to bind to RCE , can not inhibit IL-6 transcription ; therefore IL-6 transcription and secretion may occur .
Ongoing studies are delineating the transcriptional versus posttran-scriptional components of the increases in IL-6 secretion observed in the present report .
Finally , previous reports that CD40L upregulates IL-6 secretion and phosphorylation of pRB in normal B , as well as MM cells , '' *5© are also consistent with a similar mechanism .
Altered expression of pRB and related production of IL-6 by tumor cells has also been reported in 30 % of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and 58 % of patients with high grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , '' '' ~° consistent with IL-6-mediated sequelae from abnormalities in pRB in hematologic malignancies other than MM .
Future studies in hematologic malignancies of the interactions between growth factors and abnormalities of cell cycle regulating proteins may not only enhance our understanding of tumor cell growth and progression , but also suggest novel therapeutic strategies .
