In order to elucidate the EBV gene expression patterns in vivo , we examined eight patients with cutaneous EBV-related NK/T-cell lymphomas , including six patients with a NK-cell phenotype and two patients with a T-cell phenotype .
The implication of EBV in the skin lesions was determined by the presence of EBV-DNA , EBV-encoded nuclear RNA ( EBER ) and a clonality of EBV-DNA fragments containing the terminal repeats .
Transcripts of EBV-encoded genes were screened by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization .
The expression of EBV-related antigens was examined by immunostaining using paraffin-embedded tissue sections and cell pellets of EBV-positive cell lines .
Our study demonstrated that all samples from the patients contained EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) -1 mRNA which was transcribed using the Q promoter , whereas both the Q promoter and another upstream promoter ( Cp/Wp ) were used in EBV-positive cell lines , B95.8 , Raji and Jiyoye .
Latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) mRNA was detected in seven of eight patients and all cell lines , whereas EBNA-2 transcripts were found only in the cell lines .
Immunostaining showed no LMP-1 , EBNA-2 or ZEBRA antigens in the paraffin-embedded tissue sections , although they were positive in the cell line cells .
Latent BHRF1 transcripts encoding bel-2 homologue and BCRF1 transcripts encoding viral interleukin ( vIL ) -10 were detected in one and two of eight patients , respectively .
A patient with NK-cell lymphoma expressing both transcripts died of rapid progression of the illness .
Our results indicate that the restricted expression of the latency-associated EBV genes and the production of vIL-10 and bel-2 homologue may favour tumour growth , evading the host immune surveillance .
© 2001 Cancer Research Campaign - http : //www.bjcancer.com Keywords : Epstein-Barr virus ; NK/T-cell lymphomas ; latency ; viral IL-10 ; bel-2 homologue ; LMP ; EBNA Several lines of evidence have shown the association of latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection with the nasal-type , extranodal natural killer or T ( NK/T ) -cell lymphoma which occurs predominantly in Asia and Mexico ( Harabuchi et al , 1990 ; Su et al , 1991 ; Jaffe et al , 1996 ; Harris et al , 1999 ) .
This type of lymphoma primarily affects the nasal cavity and skin , exhibiting histopathological features of angiodestructive infiltration and tissue necrosis ( Su and Hsieh , 1992 ; Jaffe et al , 1996 ; Chan et al , 1997 ; Iwatsuki et al , 1997 ) , and a frequent complication of haemophagocytic syndrome ( Jaffe et al , 1983 , 1996 ) .
In addition to the presence of EBV-DNA , EBV-encoded nuclear RNA ( EBER ) is usually present in the neoplastic cells .
The detection of these molecules , therefore , provides a diagnostic clue for this disorder .
Although viral proteins such as latent membrane protein ( LMP ) and EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) may have a crucial role for EBV-induced cell transformation ( Wang et al , 1985 ; Rickinson et al , 1987 ) , the in vivo expression pattern of the virus-related molecules has not yet been clarified in the nasal type , NK/T-cell lymphoma .
Received 4 April 2000 Revised 6 December 2000 Accepted 7 December 2000 Correspondence to : K Iwatsuki ; Email : keijiiwa @ fmu.ac.jp 920 EBV-infected cells and neoplasms generally show one of three different patterns of latency-associated viral gene expression : latency I , II and III ( Rowe et al , 1987 ; Kerr et al , 1992 ) .
EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and lymphoproliferative diseases arising in immunocompromised hosts express all nine latency-associated viral proteins , including six EBNAs ( 1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C and LP ) and three LMPs ( 1 , 2A and 2B ) ( Rowe et al , 1987 ; Young et al , 1989 ; Hamilton-Dutoit et al , 1993 ) .
This pattern of EBV gene expression is designated as latency IIL .
In latency II , as noted in EBV-associated Hodgkin 's disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma , the EBNA-1 , LMP-1 and LMP-2 genes but not other EBNA genes are transcribed ( Brooks et al , 1992 ; Deacon et al , 1993 ) .
In latency I , EBV-infected cells express only EBNA-1 , which is essential for episomal replication .
This pattern is found in Burkitt 's lymphomas ( Tao et al , 1998 ) and gastric carcinomas ( Sugiura et al , 1996 ) .
The differences in the three patterns of EBV gene transcription are determined by cell phenotypes and the usage of gene promoters .
The EBNA genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic RNA molecule which is spliced to give rise to expression of the individual EBNA molecules .
The transcription in latency III is initiated from a promoter , located within the BamHI regions C and W ( the C/W promoter , Cp/Wp ) and results in a Y/U/K-spliced EBNA1 mRNA , whereas transcription of only EBNA-1 in latency I is driven by a downstream promoter located in the BamHI F and Q regions ( the Q promoter , Qp ) , generating a Q/U/K-spliced mRNA without other EBNA products ( Sample et al , 1991 ; Schaefer et al , 1991 ) .
In addition to the latency-associated genes , EBV encodes proteins that modulate the host 's immune system and inhibit apoptosis .
The BHRF1 gene has partial sequence homology to the human bel-2 gene ( Henderson et al , 1993 ) and the BCRF1 gene encodes viral interleukin ( IL ) -10 ( Moore et al , 1990 ) .
Furthermore , the BARF1l-encoded protein functions as a soluble receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1 which inhibits interferon-secretion from mononuclear cells ( Cohen et al , 1999 ) .
The expression of these molecules may be implicated in the outgrowth of EBV-infected cells .
In order to clarify the latency pattern and the expression of EBV-encoded immunoregulatory molecules , we examined the biopsy specimens from eight Japanese patients with EBV-related cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphomas .
We investigated transcripts of latency-associated EBV genes , the BHRF1 ( bel-2 homologue ) and the BCRFI ( viral IL-10 ) genes in tumour tissues by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and Southern blot hybridization .
PATIENTS , MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients Eight patients with nasal-type , extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma including six patients with a NK-cell phenotype and two with a T-cell phenotype were enrolled in the study .
The diagnoses were confirmed by immunophenotyping of the infiltrating cells and the detection of EBV-DNA , EBV-encoded RNA ( EBER ) and a clonality of EBV-DNA fragment containing the terminal repeat as described below .
The clinical manifestations of two patients ( NK3 and Tl ) have been reported in detail elsewhere ( Ohtsuka et al , 1999 ) .
Tumour samples and cell lines Paraffin-embedded skin biopsy specimens from the eight patients were examined for immunophenotypes , EBER and EBV antigens , including LMP-1 , EBNA2 and ZEBRA .
DNA samples from frozen skin biopsies were used for clonality analyses of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and EBV terminal repeats , and for EB virus antigen expression by NK/T-cell lymphomas 921 the determination of EBV gene transcripts .
Two established EBV-positive Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines , Raji and Jiyoye , and one EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line , B95.8 , served as positive controls for EBV gene transcription .
An EBV-negative T-cell line , Molt , was used as a negative control for RT-PCR .
All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 mM glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U mIl~ ' streptomycin .
In situ hybridization for EBER In situ hybridization was performed on paraffin-embedded sections .
After deparaffinization and digestion with 0.8 % pepsin ( DAKO , Glostrup ) , the sections were pre-hybridized with salmon sperm DNA and then hybridized with fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled oligonucleotide probe for EBER1 and 2 ( Novocastra , Newcastle upon Tyne ) at 37°C overnight .
After post-hybridization washing with a combination of 150 mmol 17 ' sodium chloride and 15 mmol 17 sodium citrate ( pH 7.0 ) at 50°C , the specimens were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( Novocastra ) .
Positive signals were visualized after the addition of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium .
Clonality analysis of EBV terminal repeats Frozen tissues were minced on ice in buffer containing 15 mM sodium chloride , 15 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA , and digested at 37°C overnight with 0.025 % proteinase K. Following extraction with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation , DNA was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl , 1 mM EDTA .
Five g DNA was digested with BamHI and then separated on a 0.8 % agarose gel .
The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and then hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled EBV terminal fragment probe , an Xho-1 1.9 kb fragment ( Raab-Traub and Flynn , 1986 ) .

Reverse transcription was performed using a cDNA Cycle kit ( Invitrogen ) .
PCR amplification was done with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min , followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for 1 min , an optimal annealing temperature for 45 s , 72°C for 1 min , and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min .
The RT-PCR products were transferred to nylon membranes , and then hybridized with biotin-labelled oligonucleotide probes as described previously ( Xu et al , 2000 ) .
Transcription of EBV-encoded genes including the EBNA-1 , EBNA-2 , LMP-1 , BHRFI and BCRF1 genes was examined .
The sequences of the primers , the annealing temperatures for PCR amplifications and the oligonucleotide probes for hybridization are described in Table 1 .
Immunostaining In order to detect EBV antigens , monoclonal antibodies ( DAKO ) to LMP-1 ( clone CS1-4 ) , EBNA-2 ( clone PE2 ) and ZEBRA ( clone BZLF1 ) were used .
Before incubation with anti-EBNA-2 or anti-ZEBRA antibody , deparaffinized tissue sections were boiled for 5 min in citrate buffer ( 0.1 mol 17 , pH 6.0 ) .
Incubation with the antibodies was done at 4°C overnight .
For immunophenotyping of the infiltrating cells , monoclonal antibodies to CD2 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 30 , 45RO and 57 ( DAKO ) and CD56 ( Novocastra ) were used .
The tissue sections were reacted with biotin-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulins , followed by incubation with horseradish perox-idase-labelled streptavidin .
Colorimetric reaction was performed by incubation with a substrate solution containing diaminobenzi-dine and hydrogen peroxide .
RESULTS Clinicopathologic findings The clinical features of six patients with a NK-cell phenotype ( NK 1-6 ) and two patients with a T-cell phenotype ( Tl and 2 ) are summarized in Table 2 .

All six patients with a NK-cell phenotype represented CD56 and cytoplasmic CD3 ( CD3 £ ) without any T-cell-specific antigens ( Figure 1A ) and positive signals for EBER ( Figure 1B ) .
EBER* cells ranged from 30-80 % of the infiltrating cells .
Southern blot hybridization demonstrated non-rearranged T-cell receptor genes ( Figure 2 ) .
By contrast , rearranged bands of the T-cell receptor gene were detected in two patients ( Tl and 2 ) , although a few CD56* cells were observed in case Tl ( data not shown ) .
These findings confirmed that the tumour cells in cases Tl and T2 were of T-cell lineage .

Among them , a patient with NK-cell phenotype ( NK2 ) had the most aggressive course , and died 6 months after onset .
Expression pattern of latency-associated EBV genes In order to determine the latency pattern of EBV infection in our patients , we analysed the transcripts of the EBNA-1 , EBNA-2 and LMP-1 genes by RT-PCR .
The EBNA-1 mRNA was found in all patients and EBV-positive cell lines such as B95.8 , Raji and Jiyoye , whereas the EBNA-2 mRNA was absent in our patients but was present in the cell lines .
The EBNA-1 promoters used to drive transcription were different between the patients and the cell lines .
The Cp/Wp , which generates a Y/U/K-spliced form , was only used by cell lines ( Table 3 , Figure 3 ) .
By contrast , a downstream promoter , Qp , which produces a Q/U/K initiated transcript , was used in both the cell lines and our patients .
Therefore , the EBNA-1 transcript was driven from the Qp in NK/T-cell lymphomas without usage of the Cp/Wp .
The LMP-1 mRNA was detected in seven of eight patients and the EBV-positive cell lines .
The expression of the BHRF1 gene , which has partial sequence homology to the human bel-2 proto-oncogene , was studied using two different primer sets , Y2/H3 and H2/H3 for detection of possible latent ( Y2/HF-spliced ) and lytic ( H2/HF-spliced ) tran-scripts , respectively ( Oudejans et al , 1995b ) .
Both latent Y2/HF-and lytic H2/HP-spliced transcripts of the BHRF1 gene were detected in the EBV-positive cell lines , whereas only the latent British Journal of Cancer ( 2001 ) 84 ( 7 ) , 920-925 924 Z-G Xu etal se < > '' 3 , < a ja .

Neither ( A ) LMP-1 nor ( C ) ZEBRA is present in the NKW/T cell lymphoma , but both antigens ( B and D , respectively ) are positive in B95.8 Y2/HP-spliced transcript was detected in one ( NK2 ) of eight patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma .
The BCRF1 gene , which encodes viral IL-10 , was transcribed in all EBV-positive cell lines and two patients ( NK2 and 3 ) .
The patient , NK2 , who died of the most aggressive course of the illness , expressed both the BHRF1 ( bel-2 homologue ) and BCRFI1 ( viral IL-10 ) transcripts .
EBV antigen expression The EBNA-2 and ZEBRA , an 'immediate-early ' transcriptional act-ivator was detected in the paraffin-embedded cell pellets of B95.8 , Raji and Jiyoye cells , although the percentages of the positive cells varied in the cell lines ( Figure 4 ) .
Neither EBNA-2- nor ZEBRA-positive cells were detected in the lesional tissue sections from our patients .
With paraffin-embedded tissue sections , LMP-1 antigens were strongly expressed by the EBV-positive cell lines , but no LMP-1 antigens were detected in the biopsy specimens from the patients .
DISCUSSION Our study demonstrats that in addition to EBER , both the EBNA-1 and LMP-1 genes are transcribed in vivo in patients with EBV-associated NK/T-cell lymphomas , without any EBNA-2 gene transcript .
This finding was further confirmed by the usage of promoters for the EBNA-1 gene in the patients : the Qp promoter was used in the NK/T-cell lymphomas , and both the Qp and Cp/Wp were used in the EBV-positive cell lines .
When the Qp promoter is used , the Q/U/K-spliced EBNA-1 mRNA is generated , but the other latent genes , such as EBNA-2 and EBNA-3 , can not be transcribed because the Cp/Wp promoters are silent .
These results indicate that the nasal-type , extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas expressed viral antigens of EBNA-1 and LMP-1 in the latency II pattern .
Unlike the latency III pattern observed in EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with immunodeficiency ( Hamilton-Dutoit et al , 1993 ) , NK/T-cell lymphomas may minimize the expression of the latency-associated viral antigens which might be targeted by host immune system .
British Journal of Cancer ( 2001 ) 84 ( 7 ) , 920-925 EBNA-1 is constantly expressed by EBV-infected cells in any latency pattern , but the host 's immune response never occurs against the molecules ( Levitskaya et al , 1995 ) .
LMP-1 acts as a direct oncogene to transform epithelial cells morphologically ( Fahraeus et al , 1990 ) and prevent B-lymphoma cells from undergoing apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of cellular bel-2 ( Henderson et al , 1991 ) .
We could not detect LMP-1 antigens by immunostaining despite the presence of LMP-1 gene transcripts by RT-PCR .
This discrepancy may be because RT-PCR is more sensitive than immunostaining using paraffin-embedded tissue sections .
The EBV BHRFI gene encodes a protein which has sequence homology to cellular bel-2 , and this viral bel-2 homologue protects cells from apoptosis ( Henderson et al , 1993 ) .
High levels of the BHRFI transcript are expressed in the lytic cycle , but differently spliced BHRF1 transcript was found during latency , although at much lower levels ( Oudejans et al , 1995b ) .
In our series , the latent ( Y2/HPF-spliced ) transcript was present in one case ( NK2 ) , whereas no lytic ( H2/HP-spliced ) transcript was detected in the patients ' samples .
The BCRF1 gene encodes viral IL-10 which has more than 70 % amino acid identity with human IL-10 ( Moore et al , 1990 ) .
Human and viral IL-10 share several biological functions such as inhibition of interferon-y secretion and suppression of T-cell proliferation ( Hsu et al , 1990 ) .
It has been postulated that the production of human IL-10 correlates with poor prognosis in non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( Blay et al , 1993 ) .
In our series , the BCRFI1 gene was transcribed in two patients with cutaneous NK-cell lymphomas ( NK2 and 3 ) who died after two years because of progression of the illness .
In particular , a patient , NK2 , with simultaneous expression of both viral IL-10 and viral bel-2 homologue , did have an aggressive clinical course .
The BCRF1 gene encoding viral IL-10 was thought to be transcribed only during a lytic phase of EBV replication ( Hudson et al , 1985 ) , but was recently found to be expressed very early during B-cell infection ( Miyazaki et al , 1993 ; Zeidler et al , 1997 ) .
Although the mechanism of the BCRF1 gene expression has been a controversial issue , we could not rule out the possibility that a small number of the neoplastic cells changed from the latent to the ©2001 Cancer Research Campaign lytic cycle ( Miller , 1990 ) .
Alternatively , bystander or reactive cells with lytic EBV infection might coexist in the lesions .
In conclusion , the latency II pattern of viral gene transcripts in the nasal-type , NK/T cell lymphomas ( EBER* , EBNA1* , LMP-1* , EBNAZ~ ) is distinct from that identified in B-cell system , and consistent with that identified in nasopharyngeal carcinomas .
Furthermore , the expression of viral IL-10 and bel-2 homologue might be responsible for tumour progression by interference with the host immune system and apoptosis , respectively .
