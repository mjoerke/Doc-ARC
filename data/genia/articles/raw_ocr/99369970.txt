Upon tyrosine phosphorylation , Stat proteins hetero- or homodimerize via reciprocal phosphotyrosine-Src homology domain 2 interaction and translocate to the nucleus ( 4 ) .
Stat proteins also become serine phosphorylated , and TCR ligation has been reported to stimulate a selective serine phosphorylation of Stat3 ( 5 ) , but the functional consequences of Stat protein serine phosphorylation remains a matter of controversy .
Stat proteins play a key role in the regulation of T cell growth and differentiation .
Stat protein knock-out mice are either embryonic lethal ( Stat3 ) ( 6 ) or exhibit various defects in proliferation and signal transduction ( 4 , 7 ) .
In contrast to the well-established role of Stat proteins in cytokine receptor signaling , little is known about the function of Stat proteins in TCR signaling .
In a recent study , Welte et al .
( 8 ) reported that TCR/CD3 ligation triggered tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat5 in murine T cells .
CD3-mediated Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation was mediated via the Src-family tyrosine kinase Lock and involved a transient interaction between the TCR and Stat5 in murine T cells .
Here , we show that staphylococcal enterotoxin A ( SEA ) and anti-CD3 mAb induced a rapid and accumulating tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding of Stat3 ( but not Stat5 ) in allogen-specific , human CD4 * T cell lines .
Thus , our data support the hypothesis that TCR signaling involves Src kinase-sensitive activation of Stat proteins and suggest that murine and human T lym-phocytes differ in their usage of Stat proteins in TCR signaling .
Materials and Methods Cells lines Allogen-specific CD4* human T cell lines ( 9 ) selected for this study produced no IL-2 after TCR ligation , as judged by ELISA and RNase protection assay .

Cell surface Ag analysis Cell surface expression was analyzed by flow cytometry ( FACScan ; Bec-ton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Preincubation and stimulation of cells T cells ( 9 ) were incubated in medium containing anti-CD3 Ab ( 5 ug/ml ) , IL-2 ( 500 U/m !
) , SEA , and SEE ( 1 pg/m1 ) , wortmannin ( 5 M ) , rapamycin ( 25 ng/ml ) , or PP1 ( 10 uM ) for the indicated periods of time .
Cells were preincubated with inhibitors 1 h before incubation with cytokine , anti-CD3 Ab , or SE .
Before stimulation , cells were starved for 4 h in medium containing 5 % FCS .
Protein extraction and Western blotting Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were conducted as described earlier ( 9 ) .
Immunoblots were evaluated by chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Oligonucleotide affinity purification Precipitation with biotinylated oligonucleotides was conducted as described for immunoprecipitations .
Purified oligonucleotide-binding proteins were boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting , as described earlier ( 9 ) .
Results Anti-CD3 Ab and SEA induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in Ag-specific , human CD4 * T cell lines ( Fig .
1 , A and D ) .
The kinetics of SEA- and anti-CD3 mAb-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation were essentially identical .
Phosphotyrosine Stat3 was detected within 1 min and was gradually accumulated for up to 60 min .
In contrast , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 showed a distinctly different activation pattern and reached a maximum within 3-10 min , followed by a gradual decline within 60 min ( Fig .
1G ) .
The serine phosphorylation of Stat3 induced by anti-CD3 Ab and SEA ( Fig .
1 , B and E ) followed a pattern that resembled the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern .
Again , IL-2 induced a significantly different Stat3 serine phosphorylation pattern ( Fig .
1H ) .
Reprobing the nitrocellulose membranes with an anti-Stat3 Ab verified that equal amounts of Stat3 were present in the samples analyzed .
Immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated proteins and immunoblotting with an anti-Stat3 Ab confirmed that SEA induced a gradual increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 reaching a maximum after 2 h ( Fig .
24 ) , whereas IL-2 induced a rapid , but transient increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 .
Recently , TCR stimulation was shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 in murine T cells ( 8 ) .
To address whether CD3 ligation also induced Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation , human T cells were treated with anti-CD3 mAb and IL-2 .
IL-2 induced activation of Stat3 and Stat5 after 10 min , whereas TCR ligation for 1 h activated only Stat3 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Furthermore , we were unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5 after 10 min of CD3 ligation ( data not shown ) .
We utilized biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides from different Stat3-binding promoter elements to investigate whether SEA induced binding of Stat3 to relevant DNA sequences .
SEA induced binding of Stat3 to DNA oligonucleotides from the ICAM-1 and the IL-2Ra promoter within 1-4 h. In contrast , IL-2 induced Stat3 binding to these probes within 30-60 min ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
Moreover , IL-2 also induced Stat5 binding to a biotinylated c-fos probe , whereas SEA induced only Stat3 activation ( data not shown ) , supporting our conclusion that SEA and IL-2 induce activation of different Stat proteins .
Four hours after binding of Stat3 to the ICAM-1 and IL-2Ra « probes , an increase in the surface expression of ICAM-1 and IL-2Ra could be detected by flow cytometry , which peaked within 1743 A i- XCR -- -- i med .

SEA induces rapid tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 .
Cells were incubated with medium , anti-CD3 Ab , SEA , or IL-2 for the indicated periods of time , and whole cell lysate was immunoblotted and reprobed with Abs against phosphotyrosine-Stat3 ( A , D , and , G ) , phospho-serine-Stat3 ( B , E , and H ) , and Stat3 ( C , F , and 1 ) .
16-24 h ( Fig .
3 , C and D ) .
In contrast , SEA incubation had little effect on the surface expression of IL-2Ry and CD38 ( data not shown ) .
Recent evidence suggests that Lock , an Sre family tyrosine kinase , plays a critical role in TCR-mediated activation of Stat5 in murine T cells ( 8 ) .
Here , we utilized an Src kinase inhibitor ( PP1 ) to address whether Sre kinases also play a role in CD3-mediated activation of Stat3 .
At concentrations above 5 M , PP1 almost completely blocked SE-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 , but had no inhibitory effect on IL-2-induced Stat3 activation ( Fig .
4 ) .
SEA-induced serine phosphorylation of Stat3 was also inhibited by PP1 ( data not shown ) .
SEA-induced binding of Stat3 to the ICAM-1-probe was also profoundly inhibited by PP1 , whereas rapamycin had only a weak inhibitory effect ( Fig .
4B ) .
Wortmannin ( wort ) , an inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol-3 ( PI-3 ) kinase , had no effect on SEA- and IL-2-induced DNA binding of Stat3 ( Fig .
4B ) .
SEA-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 and IL-2Ra expression was profoundly inhibited by PP1 , whereas rapamycin had only a weak inhibitory effect ( Fig .
4 , C and D ) .

CD3 ligation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 , but not Stat5 .
A , Cells were incubated with medium , SEA , or IL-2 for the indicated periods of time , precipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab ( 4G10 ) , and immunoblotted with anti-Stat3 Ab .
B , Cells were incubated with medium , IL-2 , or anti-CD3 Ab as indicated and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine Stat3 or anti-phosphotyrosine Stat5 .
Blots were reprobed with anti-Stat3 and anti-Stat5 .
Discussion Here , we provide the first evidence that anti-CD3 Ab and SEA induced a rapid , gradually increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in allogen-specific , human CD4 * T cell lines .
IL-2 induced a rapid , but transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 , suggesting that TCR and IL-2R activate Stat3 through distinct pathways .
This conclusion was supported by our observations that SEA-induced Stat3 activation was blocked by PP1 , whereas IL-2-induced Stat3 A IL-2 IL-2 SEA SEA SEA med .

Reversely , IL-2-induced Stat3 activation was inhibited by an IL-2Ra blocking mAb , whereas CD3-induced Stat3 activation was not ( data not shown ) .
In a recent study , Welte et al .
( 8 ) reported that anti-CD3 mAb induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 in murine T cells .
However , we did not detect any Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation following CD3 stimulation in human T cells .
Yet , IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 in these T cells .
It is possible that TCR stimulation activates different Stat proteins in man and mouse .
An alternative explanation might be that different T cell populations ( e.g. , naive vs memory T cells ) induce different sets of Stat proteins after TCR ligation .
Src tyrosine kinases , such as Lek , play a crucial role in the early steps of TCR-mediated signal transduction .
Lek mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in the TCR , which resemble and might function as Stat protein docking sites .
Welte et al .
( 8 ) provided strong evidence that Lek plays a critical role in TCR-mediated Stat5 activation in murine T cells .
Here , we show that PP1 , an Src kinase inhibitor , blocked CD3-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding .
It remains unknown whether Stat3 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated directly or indirectly upon TCR stimulation .
IL-2R ligation triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins through an activation of Jak3 and Jak1 ( 3 ) .
We were unable to detect activated Jak kinases ( Jak1 , Jak2 , Jak3 , and Tyk2 ) following TCR stimulation in human T cells ( data not shown ) .
This observation was in agreement with other reports that TCR stimulation did not trigger activation of Jak kinase activity ( 10 ) .
Differences between the data presented here and previous studies on tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 following TCR stimulation ( 11 ) may lie partly in the cells and detection systems used .
Here , we used Abs against tyrosine phosphorylated Stat3 and Stat5 , which are highly sensitive , to detect tyrosine phosphorylation .

CD3-induced Stat3 activation and modulated surface expression of ICAM-1 and IL-2Ra is sensitive to PP1 .
A and B , Cells were preincubated with PP1 , rapamycin , or wortmannin , before incubation with medium , IL-2 ( 15 min ) , SEA ( 1 h ) , or SEE ( 1 h ) , as indicated .
Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab and immunoblotted with anti-Stat3 Ab .
C and D , Cells were incubated with different inhibitors for 1 h , as indicated , and subsequently with SEA for 12 h. Cells were examined for cell surface expression of ICAM-1 and IL-2R « by flow cytometry ( FACScan ) .
Recent evidence suggest that TCR stimulation triggers Stat3 2. serine phosphorylation via an activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in T cells ( 12 ) .
Using Abs against serine phosphory- lated Stat3 , Cantrell and colleague ( 5 ) observed serine phosphor- 3 ylation of Stat3 following TCR stimulation .
Our data confirm and extend these findings .
Since PP1 inhibited TCR-mediated serine phosphorylation , our results suggest Src family kinases to be in- 5. volved in both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in human T cells .
As IL-2 induces Stat3 activation in T cells ( 9 ) , we investigated the possibility that TCR-induced Stat3 activation was due to an autocrine loop involving IL-2 .
First , TCR ligation triggers Stat3 activation in T cells that do not produce IL-2 ( as judged by RNase protection assay and ELISA ) .
Second , TCR triggers a rapid phosphorylation of Stat3 , but not Stat5 , whereas IL-2 triggers a rapid phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5 in parallel .
Third , an IL-2R 8. blocking mAb inhibits IL-2-induced Stat3 activation without affecting TCR-mediated Stat3 phosphorylation .
However , our data do not exclude the possibility that the accumulated increase in 9. phosphorylated Stat3 was due to an autocrine , cytokine-mediated activation loop .
10 .
In conclusion , we provide the first evidence that CD3 ligation triggers rapid Stat3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation via a PP1 sensitive pathway in human CD4 * T cell lines .
