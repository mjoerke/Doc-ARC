We isolated a novel subline , UT-7/GMT , from the human leukemia cell line UT-7/GM ( N. Komatsu , et al. , Blood , 89 : 4021-4033 , 1997 ) .
A small population of UT-7/GM cells positively stained for hemoglobin ( Hb ) after a 7-day exposure to TPO .
More than 50 % of TPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells positively stained for Hb .
Using UT-7/GMT cells , we examined how TPO promotes hemoglobinization .
TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO receptor but not the erythropoietin ( EPO ) receptor .
There was no competition between TPO and EPO for binding to EPO receptor .
These findings suggest that TPO has a direct effect on hemogliobinization via a specific receptor on UT-7/GMT cells .
Isoelectric focusing demonstrated that TPO induced fetal and adult Hb synthesis , whereas EPO induced embryonic , fetal , and adult Hb synthesis .
Thus , our data suggest that TPO has a distinct action on erythropoiesis .

One is the EPO domain , which has significant homology with EPO , the key regulator of erythro-poiesis ; this EPO domain is sufficient for TPO receptor activation ( 2 ) .
The other is a unique , potentially N-linked glyco-sylation domain ; this second domain is similar to the EPO 3 ' noncoding region ( 3 ) .
These findings suggest that EPO and TPO genes evolved from a common ancestral sequence by duplication .
Thus , the proliferation and maturation of megakaryocyte and erythroid precursors are regulated by the structurally and ontogenically related cytokines TPO and EPO , respectively .
Recently , it was found that TPO has erythroid burst-promoting activity in vitro ( 4 ) .
In addition , the administration of TPO to myelosuppressed mice and normal mice elevated the number of erythroid and megakaryocyte progenitors ( 5 , 6 ) .
Very recently , it was reported that TPO directly acted on pure erythroid progenitor cells expressing CD41 and the TPO receptor ( 7 ) .
Moreover , Kieran et al .
( 8 ) reported that TPO supports not only proliferation but also maturation of erythroid progenitors in vitro in mouse embryos lacking the EPOR .
Thus , there is little doubt that TPO is involved in erythropoiesis .
However , the mechanism by which TPO induces erythroid differentiation remains unknown .
To further understand the role of TPO in erythropoiesis , we isolated a novel subline , UT-7/GMT , from the human cytokine-dependent cell line UT-7/GM ( 9 ) .
UT-7/GMT can differentiate into erythroid cells with a high concentration of Hb after treatment with TPO .
Using this cell line , we analyzed the mechanism by which TPO induced erythroid differentiation .
Results Establishment of the UT-7/GMT Cell Line .
UT-7/GM is a bipotential cell line that can differentiate into erythroid or megakaryocytic lineages with EPO or TPO , respectively ( 9 ) .
In this study , we focused on evidence that a minor population of UT-7/GM cells differentiate into Hb-positive cells after a 2-week exposure to TPO ( 9 ) .
To isolate a subline that definitely differentiates into erythroid cells by TPO , we seeded UT-7/GM cells onto methylcellulose semisolid medium and randomly picked 12 colonies .
A single colony was transferred to liquid culture medium containing 1 ng/ml GM-CSF .
Each clone was then expanded , washed of growth factor , and incubated with fresh medium containing 10 ng/m !
TPO .
Clones contained a range of 0-62.3 % positive dianisidine staining cells after TPO treatment .
In the following experiments , we used clone 11 , which showed the highest dianisidine positivity after TPO treatment , and designated this clone UT-7Z/GMT .

Increase of Hb synthesis by EPO and TPO and suppression by GM-CSF in UT-7/GMT cells .
UT-7/GMT cells were cultured with GM-CSF { 1 ng/ml } ; ® ) , EPO ( 1 unit/ml ; or TPO ( 10 ng/ml ; © ) .
At the indicated times , the cells were harvested and stained with dianisidine as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Data points , means of three independent experiments ; bars , SD .
The UT-7/GMT cell line has saturation densities of 1.2 % 105/ml , 1.0 x 10°/ml , and 9 x 10°/ml in the presence of GM-CSF , EPO , and TPO , respectively ( Fig .
14 ) .
The growth activities of GM-CSF , EPO , and TPO toward UT-7/GMT cells were almost the same as those from a MTT assay in short-term culture ( Fig .
1 , B and C ) .
When growth factors were removed from the culture , however , the cells died within a few days .
This indicated that UT-7/GMT also had absolute dependency on these cytokines for growth and survival , as did the original UT-7 and UT-7/GM .
We found that 80 , 50 , and 0.3 % of the cells were positive for dianisidine staining after 5-day exposures to EPO , TPO , and GM-CSF , respectively ( Fig .
2 ) .
Fig .
3 shows the morphological characteristics of UT-7/ GMT cultured with GM-CSF , EPO , or TPO for 7 days .
The cytospin smear of cells cultured with GM-CSF contained cells with a prominent nucleolus and cytoplasmic blebs ( Fig .
3A ) .
After treatment with EPO or TPO , the cells became smaller , lost their cytoplasmic vacuoles and blebs , and showed proerythroblast-like morphology ( Fig .
3 , B and C ) .
Thus , morphological analysis revealed that UT-7/GMT differentiated to erythroid cells with TPO or EPO treatment .
This was confirmed by dianisidine staining ( Fig .
3 , D-F ) TPO Transduces Signals via c-Mpl but not EPOR .
To exclude the possibility that a TPO-induced hemoglobinization signal was transduced by EPOR , we examined whether TPO induces tyrosine phosphorylation of EPOR .
EPOR was tyrosine-phosphorylated by EPO but not by TPO ( Fig .
4A ) .
In contrast , TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Mpl but not of EPOR ( Fig .
4B ) .
Anti-c-Mp !
antibodies specifically inhibited TPO- but not EPO-induced proliferation ( data not shown ) .
We could not examine whether or not these anti-c-Mpl antibodies inhibited TPO-induced hemoglobinization of UT-7/GMT cells because the cells died within a few days after the addition of these antibodies to the culture medium containing TPO alone ( data not shown ) .
RT-PCR revealed that EPO mRNA was undetectable in TPO-treated UT-7/ GMT cells ( data not shown ) .
In addition , EPO activity was undetectable by RIA in conditioned medium from TPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these findings indicate that TPO transduces its signals via the activation of its specific receptor , c-Mpl .
There Is No Competition between TPO and EPO for Binding to EPOR .
To further confirm this notion , we performed the competition assay between EPO and TPO for binding to EPOR .
The number of EPO-binding sites per cell was 784 + 210 ( n = 3 ) in untreated UT-7/GMT cells .
The number was almost unchanged in the presence of 1 and 10 ng/m| TPO , respectively [ 715 + 273 ( n = 3 ) versus 701 + 59 ( n = 3 ) ] .
Although a high dose of TPO ( 100 ng/m ! )
reduced the number of EPO-binding sites [ 511 + 150 ( n = 3 ) ] , there was no statistical significance .
Thus , these results suggested that TPO did not compete with binding of EPO to EPOR on the cell surface ( Fig .
5 ) .

Protein kinase C activity was significantly and equally elevated by the addition of GM-CSF , EPO , or TPO ( data not shown ) .
Mitogen-activated protein kinase was activated at 10 min with each cytokine .
This activity was relatively retained with GM-CSF treatment , but it declined after EPO or TPO ( data not shown ) .
TPO Induces Expression of Erythroid-specific Genes and Transcription Factors .
To further elucidate the mechanism by which TPO induces hemoglobinization , we examined the expression of several genes associated with erythroid differentiation .
There was two peaks of GATA-1 expression after EPO stimulation : one early ( 6 h ) and a second later peak ( day 5 ) , whereas GATA-1 remained significantly unchanged after exposure to TPO ( Fig .
7 ) .
With EPO treatment , the level of GATA-2 was basically correlated with the level of GATA-1 .
The kinetics of GATA-2 mRNA level after TPO treatment was almost the same as those after EPO treatment .
Increased expression of ALAS-E mRNA was observed after 6 and 12 h of exposure to TPO or EPO , and it reached maximum levels 24 and 72 h after TPO and EPO treatment , respectively .
The peak was sustained until day 7 with both cytokines .
With TPO treatment , expression of NF-E2 mRNA increased after 3 h of stimulation , reached a peak at 6 h , and was sustained thereafter .
With EPO treatment , expression of NF-E2 gradually elevated , reached a maximum at day 3 , and thereafter was sustained .
The peaks of y-globin and ALAS-E mRNA induced by TPO appeared earlier than those induced by EPO at 24 h and were also sustained .
The kinetics of expression of GPllb and c-mp/ mRNAs were similar with both cytokines .
PF4 mRNA was detected at a low level by RT-PCR in pretreated UT-7/GMT antibodies against JAK2 or STATS to confirm equal loading of samples .
Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments ; representative results are shown .
Blot : « -Stat5 cells .
After 3-5 days of exposure to TPO , PF4 mRNA became undetectable and then reappeared after 7 days of exposure to TPO ( Fig .
8 ) .
In contrast , dianisidine-positive cells disappeared after 2 weeks of exposure to TPO without decreased cell viability ( data not shown ) .
EPO did not induce PF4 mRNA during the observation periods ( Fig .
8 ) .
TPO Predominantly Induces Fetal and Adult Hb .
To elucidate whether the pattern of Hb induced by each cyto-kine was different , we examined IEF of UT-7/GMT .
Cells were washed of growth factors and incubated with fresh medium containing the indicated cytokines .
After 5 days of treatment , cells were harvested and applied to IEF analysis .
Slight amounts of HbF ( a2y2 ) , HbA ( « 28B2 ) , HbX ( e2y2 ) , HbBart 's ( 44 ) , and HbPortland ( { 2y2 ) were detected in UT-7/ GMT cells maintained with GM-CSF ( Fig .
9 ) .
With EPO treatment , HbF ( « 2y2 ) was induced ~2-fold , HbA ( « 2B2 ) was induced 3-fold , and HbX ( e27y2 ) , HbBart 's ( 44 ) , and HbPortland ( £272 ) were all induced 5-fold , compared with GM-CSF treatment .
With TPO treatment , HbF ( a272 ) and HbA ( « 2B2 ) were induced > 4-fold compared with GM-CSF , but HbX ( e2y2 ) , HbBart 's ( y4 ) , and HbPortland { ( { 2y2 ) were decreased compared with GM-CSF .
Thus , whereas EPO induced embryonic , fetal , and adult Hb synthesis , TPO induced only fetal and adult Hb synthesis .
To detect the Hb pattern of UT-7/ GMT under maintenance conditions , the protein volume loaded in Fig .
9 , Lane 5 , was double that loaded in Fig .
9 , Lane 3 or 4 , because the Hb content of untreated UT-7/GMT was too low to detect .
Relationship between TPO-induced Hemoglobinization and Cell Cycle .
We examined whether TPO induced G , prolongation in UT-7/GMT cells because G , prolongation is thought to be a trigger of erythroid differentiation ( 12 , 13 ) .
The percentage of cells in the G/G , phase was unchanged 24 h after addition of 10 ng/ml TPO ( Fig .

in the presence of 10 ng TPO/mIl , GM-CSF reduced the G/G , number ( Fig .

The minimum G/G , phase and maximum cell growth were obtained in the presence of 1 ng/m !
GM-CSF , at which concentration none of the cells became dianisidine positive ( Fig .
10C ) .
These findings indicate that a high dose of GM-CSF shortened the TPO-induced G , prolongation of UT-7/GMT cells , resulting in the inhibition of TPO-induced erythroid differentiation , as was the case for EPO ( 9 ) .
Discussion In this study , we isolated a novel subline , UT-7/GMT , which can differentiate into cells with mature erythroid properties following treatment with TPO .
Using this subline , we examined the mechanism by which TPO induced hemoglobinization of UT-7/GMT cells .
We demonstrated that TPO signals were transduced into the nucleus via its specific receptor c-Mpl but not EPOR and that G , prolongation was a critical event for TPO-induced erythroid differentiation of this cell line , as is the case for EPO .
Because the sensitivity of UT-7/GMT cells to TPO is much lower than that of GM-CSF by MTT assay , G , prolongation or G , arrest may have transiently occurred by replacement of GM-CSF with TPO .
If so , this hypothesis provides an explanation for the observation that TPO induced hemoglobinization of UT-7/GMT cells because G , prolongation is thought to be a trigger of erythroid differentiation ( 12 , 13 ) .

- Hb synthesis after TPO treatment .
UT-7/GMT cells were cultured with TPO ( 10 ng/m !
; Lane 3 ) , EPO ( 1 unit/ml ; Lane 4 ) , or GM-CSF ( 1 ng/ml ; Lane 5 ) .
After 5 days of incubation , the cells were harvested and prepared for IEF as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Cord blood ( Lane 1 ) and adult peripheral blood ( Lane 2 ) were applied for controls of HbF and HbA , respectively .
The sample extracted from GM-CSF-treated UT-7/GMT cells was applied in 2-fold excess to show the Hb pattern .
Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments ; representative results are shown .
the cell cycle of UT-7/GMT cells .
The addition of TPO to growth factor-deprived UT-7/GMT cells caused a G , prolon-gation .
However , 1 ng/ml GM-CSF shortened the G , prolon-gation , even in the presence of TPO , presumably mediated through the activation of genes leading to entry into cell cycle .
As a result , a relatively high dose of GM-CSF would inhibit TPO-induced hemoglobinization and promote cell proliferation .
Thus , there seems to be a close relationship between cell cycle and TPO-induced hemoglobinization .
Taken together , the hypothesis proposed by Carroll et a/ .
( 12 ) that induction of erythroid differentiation requires G , prolongation of the cell cycle also may be true for TPO ( 13 ) .
However , this notion can not completely explain the mechanism by which TPO induced hemoglobinization of UT-7/GMT cells because there is a significant difference in Hb patterns between EPO and TPO .
Although this concept is speculative at present , an additional mechanism may be involved in TPO-induced erythroid differentiation .
It is noteworthy that TPO induced fetal and adult Hb synthesis and suppressed embryonic Hb synthesis .
Consistent with our results , others have shown that erythroid cells differentiated from the murine yolk sac by stimulation with TPO were definitive erythrocytes ( 14 ) .
The different patterns of Hb expression induced by EPO and TPO indicate two possibil-ities .
One is that TPO acts predominantly on the precursor , which will differentiate to definitive erythrocytes , but not on those which will differentiate to primitive erythrocytes .
It was recently reported that primitive and definitive erythrocytes developed from different precursors ( 15 ) .
However , because UT-7/GMT was derived from a single cell , this notion seems less likely and remains a current controversy ( 16 ) .
The second possibility is that TPO is directly involved in Hb switch-ing .

Hemoglobinization and cell cycle after TPO treatment .

Cells were harvested 6 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h after stimulation for cell cycle analysis .

C , suppression by GM-CSF of TPO-induced hemoglobinization in a dose-dependent manner .
UT-7/GMT cells were cultured with increasing concentrations of GM-CSF ( 0.01-10 ng/m ! )
in the presence of 10 ng/ml TPO .
Five days later , the cells were harvested and stained with dianisidine , as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments ; representative results are shown .
to fetal globin gene is suggested to be autonomous by experiments with transgenic mice ( 17 ) .
Therefore , TPO may directly or indirectly affect the transcriptional silencer or negative regulator of embryonic globin genes .
However , further investigation will be required to address this issue .
TPO also induced ALAS-E mRNA in UT-7/GMT cells , as did EPO .
ALAS-E is an erythroid-specific isozyme of 5-aminolevulinate synthetase , which is essential for heme synthesis .
Because decreased ALAS-E activity due to a point mutation in the ALAS-E gene is seen in patients with X-linked sideroblastic anemia ( 18 ) , ALAS-E must be critical to the hemoglobinization process that requires a large amount of heme for Hb synthesis .
Analysis of genomic DNA clones encoding human ALAS-E gene revealed that a cluster of cis-acting elements involved in determining erythroid-specific transcriptional activation , e.g. , GATA-1 , activator protein-1/NF-E2 , CACCC , and CCAAT factor binding se-quences , were found in the promoter region of the ALAS-E gene ( 19 ) .
The dynamic kinetics of y-globin and ALAS-E mRNAs paralleled those of NF-E2 mRNA in TPO- or EPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells .
Although NF-E2 was found to be essential for terminal maturation of megakaryocytes rather than for erythroid differentiation ( 20 ) , several lines of evidence have demonstrated that NF-E2 is involved in a- and B-globin gene expression ( 21 ) .
Therefore , it is likely that NF-E2 plays some role in TPO-induced hemoglobinization in this system .
When TPO-treated cells were again exposed to a maintenance dose of GM-CSF alone , the majority of cells became negative for dianisidine staining within 1 week ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that TPO-induced hemoglobinization of UT-7/GMT cells is reversible .
Therefore , GM-CSF may influence gene expression required for lineage commitment or differentiation .
This hypothesis has previously been proposed by ourselves and other laboratories ( 9 , 22 , 23 ) .
It is important to determine whether TPO induced erythropoiesis through binding of TPO to the EPOR .
First , TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Mpl but not EPOR , suggesting that TPO did not activate EPOR .
Second , TPO did not compete with binding of EPO to EPOR on the surface of UT-7/GMT cells in the range of 1-100 ng/m ( Fig .
5 ) .
Third , other groups reported that anti-EPO neutralizing antibodies did not block TPO-induced erythroid maturation ( 24 ) .
These observations strongly suggest that TPO has a direct effect on erythroid progenitors through TPO-c-Mpl signaling .
This notion was also supported by evidence that TPO can rescue production of erythroid cells from erythroid progenitors in mice lacking EPOR ( 8 ) .
Although we understand that it is important to examine whether or not anti-EPOR blocking antibodies suppress TPO-induced hemoglobinization , these antibodies are not presently available in our laboratory .
It is interesting that y-globin mRNA was transiently up-regulated and PF4 mRNA was transiently down-regulated in TPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells .
This finding indicates that TPO induced erythroid differentiation and blocked megakaryocytic differentiation when cells were exposed to TPO for < 7 days .
These results are consistent with the previous report that erythroid-specific genes , such as globins , were shut down during megakaryocytic differentiation ( 25 ) .
The evidence that TPO induced induction of y-globin mRNA earlier than did EPO ( Fig .
7 ) may explain the following observation : TPO induced Hb synthesis of fetal and adult types but not embryonic globin , whereas EPO induced synthesis of embryonic , fetal , and adult types .
When UT-7/GMT cells were continuously exposed to TPO for 2 weeks , Hb-positive cells disappeared , and PF4 mRNA became clearly detectable in cells .
These data suggest that TPO transiently supported erythropoiesis .
Because we did not observe decreased cell viability in TPO-treated UT-7/ GMT cells , Hb-positive cells induced by a short exposure to 493 494 - Thrombopoietin and Erythropoiesis TPO may have finally differentiated into cells having mature megakaryocytic properties because of the continuous presence of TPO .
Because TPO-induced hemoglobinization is a reversible change as described above , it is not so surprising that Hb-positive cells became megakaryocytic cells later .
This problem is intriguing and important ; however , we have not yet isolated Hb-positive cells exposed for several days to answer this question .
Yoshimura et al .
( 26 ) described an activation of STATS that is closely linked to erythroid differentiation in a murine erythroleukemia cell line .
In contrast , Chretien et al .
( 27 ) reported that activation of STATS induced cell growth and inhibited erythroid differentiation in a human erythroleukemia cell line .
Thus , whether STATS is directly involved in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation remains controversial ( 27 , 28 ) .
In this study , we showed that STATS was commonly activated by EPO , TPO , or GM-CSF , and GM-CSF simultaneously inhibited TPO- or EPO-induced hemoglobinization of UT-7/GMT cells .
This finding suggests that STATS activation may be required but is not sufficient for TPO- or EPO-induced erythroid differentiation of UT-7/GMT cells .
A third factor may be required for commitment to erythroid differentiation .
Alterna-tively , the dynamic kinetics of STATS activation may be important for cytokine-specific actions , as we have proposed previously ( 28 ) .
For example , constitutive activation of STATS is required for TPO-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of a human megakaryoblastic cell line CMK ( 29 ) .
In summary , our results indicate that TPO induced erythroid differentiation of UT-7/GMT cells via its specific receptor , c-Mpl .
An apparent difference in patterns of Hb expression between EPO and TPO treatment implies that TPO has a distinct effect on erythropoiesis , although we must consider that the results were obtained using a leukemia cell line .

RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on agarose formaldehyde gels , transferred to nylon membranes ( Zeta-probe ; Bio-Rad ) in 10x SSC , and hybridized to human cDNA fragments for EPOR , y-globin , PF4 , or GPilb , with human ribosomal DNA probe as a standard control .
These fragments were labeled with [ a-*°P ] CTP by random priming .
After an overnight incubation at 43°C in the presence of 50 % formamide , blots were washed three times with 2x SSC , 0.5 % SSC , 0.1 SSC , and 0.1 % SDS for 15 min each .
The membranes were autoradiographed using Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen at -70°C .
The mRNA content obtained by RNA blot hybridization was quantitated by densitometry ( model CS-9000 ; Shi-madzu , Kyoto , Japan ) .
Preparation of Cell Lysates , Immunoprecipitation , and Western Blotting .
UT-7/GMT cells were deprived of growth factor for 24 h. After stimulation with cytokines at 37°C for indicated period , cells were washed and suspended in lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 137 mm NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mm phenylmethyisulfonyl fluo-ride , 15 mg/ml !
aprotinin , and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate .
After 20 min of incubation on ice , insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 10 min .
The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-EPOR , c-Mpl , JAK2 , STATS , and phosphotyrosine ( 4G10 ) polyclonal antibody attached to protein G-Sepharose for 4 h at 4°C in an Eppendorf shaker .
Immunoprecipitates were collected by a brief centrifugation and washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer .
The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer .
After a brief centrifugation , the supematants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and elec-troblotted onto a PVDF membrane ( Bio-Rad ) .
The blots were blocked with 1 % BSA for 1 h and then incubated with the appropriate concentration of primary antibodies , including anti-P-Tyr monoclonal antibody 4G10 for 1 h at room temperature .
After washing with PBS containing Tween 20 ( 1 : 2,000 ) , the blots were probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit antimouse or goat antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 20 min at room temperature .
After a second wash , the blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , England ) and exposed to Hyperfilim ECL to visualize immunoreactive bands .
The blots were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 6.8 ) , 2 % SDS , and 100 mm B-mercaptoethanol at 50°C for 30 min , washed , blocked , and reprobed .
Characterization of Hb .
Hb fractions were analyzed by IEF according to the method described previously ( 35 ) .

Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 15 min .
The lysates were subjected to IEF on a slab of acrylamide gel with LKB ampholines from pH 6 to pH 9 as a gradient .
After electrophoresis , benzidine staining was performed to de Cell Growth & Differentiation tect the peroxidase activity of Hb .
To characterize the Hbs , adult RBCs ( HbA ) and cord blood cells ( HbF ) were used as controls .

Cell-cycle analysis was performed by staining DNA with propidium iodide in preparation for flow cytometry with the FACScan/CellFIT system ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA } .
RT-PCR and Souther Blotting Analysis .
Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells according to the methods of Chomezynski and Sacchi ( 34 ) .
RT-PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers as follows .
PF4 forward ( 5'-GCTGAAGCTGAAGAAGATGGG-3 ' ) and reverse ( 5'-TAGCAAATGCACACACGTAGG-3 ' ) primers amplified a 247-bp fragment of the PF4 cDNA ( 36 ) .
The EPO forward ( 5'-GTCGGGCAGCAGGCCGTA-GAAGTCTGGCAG-3 '' ) and reverse ( 5'-AGATGTCATTGCTGGCACTG-GAGTGTCCAT-3 ' ) primers amplified a 485-bp fragment of the EPO cDNA ( 37 ) .

Amplification products were separated on 2 % agarose TAE gels stained with ethidium bromide and photo-graphed .
Quantitative Flow Cytometric Assay of EPOR .
Quantitative flow cytometric assay of EPOR was performed as described previously ( 39 ) .
We performed a flow cytometric assay using cells stained with b-EPO and a streptavidin-RED670 conjugate .
For quantification , we applied the Kol-mogorov-Smirnov test and calculated D. D was evaluated from the degree of shift in two fluorescence profiles according to the increase in fluorescence intensity due to the specific binding of b-EPO to EPORs in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled TPO ( up to 100 ng/ml } .
