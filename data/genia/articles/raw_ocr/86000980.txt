Differential Protection of Normal and Malignant Human Myeloid Progenitors ( CFU-GM ) From Ara-C Toxicity Using Cycloheximide By Christopher A. Slapak , Robert L. Fine , and Carol M. Richman Cycloheximide , a reversible protein synthesis inhibitor , is thought to block DNA replication in normal cells by preventing synthesis of a labile protein .
In animal systems , cycloheximide protects normal cells from cytotoxic S-phase specific agents , such as cytosine arabinoside ( Ara-C ) .
Malignant cells appear not to be susceptible to cycloheximide-induced cycle arrest and , subsequently , may not be protected from Ara-C cytotoxicity .
The effect of cycloheximide on granulocyte/macrophage progenitors ( CFU-GM ) after in vitro Ara-C exposure was examined using normal human bone marrow , malignant progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , FFECTIVE TREATMENT of nonlymphocytic leukemia is limited by the lack of cytotoxic drug specificity for neoplastic hematopoietic cells .
Chemotherapy destroys normal as well as malignant progenitors , leading to severe myelosuppression .
Attempts to improve the therapeutic index of drugs used in the treatment of acute leukemia by manipulating cell cycle kinetics ( eg , cell synchronization or recruitment ) have not been consistently more effective than empirically designed treatment protocols . ''
Cycloheximide and other reversible protein synthesis inhibitors have been shown in animal systems to protect normal epithelial and bone marrow cells from S-phase specific cytotoxic agents , such as cytosine arabinoside ( Ara-C ) .
In normal cells , synthesis of a labile protein is necessary for DNA synthesis to proceed . ''
Inhibition of protein synthesis prevents DNA synthesis and therefore diminishes Ara-C toxicity .
In transformed cells , DNA replication appears to be independent of protein synthesis . ''
Thus , cycloheximide could potentially affect a differential protection of normal v malignant cells from phase-specific cytotoxic drugs .
To evaluate this hypothesis in a human myelopoietic system , we examined the effect of cycloheximide on the in vitro cytotoxicity of Ara-C on normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitors ( CFU-GM ) , on malignant progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , and on clonogenic cells from human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cells lines HL-60 and KG-1 .

Mononuclear or clonogenic cells were incubated for one hour with cyciohexi-mide , followed by the addition , for three or 17 hours , of Ara-C before being plated in a methylcellulose culture system .
CFU-GM survival was significantly increased if normal cells were treated with cycloheximide before Ara-C exposure .
Similar cycloheximide pretreatment of CML progenitors and clonogenic HL-60 and KG-1 cells failed to protect CFU-GM from Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity .
© 1985 by Grune & Stratton , Inc. blood samples from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in the stable chronic phase were obtained during routine clinical evaluations .
All patients were untreated at the time of study .
Heparinized bone marrow aspirates were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients ( S.G. 1.077 ) to obtain mononuclear cells for study . '' ''
In patients with CML , fresh ( two patients ) or eryopre-served ( seven patients ) mononuclear cells obtained by leukapheresis were used instead of Ficoli-Hypaque-separated cells . ''
The cryopreserved cells had been frozen in 10 % dimethylsulfoxide and 20 % autologous plasma using a controlled rate of - 1 °C/per minute and were stored in the low vapor phase of liquid nitrogen ( approximately -150 °C ) . ''
Vials of cryopreserved cells were thawed rapidly at 37 °C and diluted tenfold over ten minutes and then rapidly diluted to the appropriate cell concentration before drug incubation .
HL-60 and KG-1 cells were maintained in suspension culture using RPMI 1640 medium containing 15 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( Flow Laboratories , Bethesda , Md ) and were routinely subcultured every seven days .
To ensure log phase growth , cells were also subcultured 72 hours before each study .
'* '' * Cycloheximide ( Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis ) was incubated with mononuclear cell suspensions at a final concentration of 1 or 10 ug/ml .
Ara-C ( Upjohn Co , Kalamazoo , Mich ) was added to the cell suspensions one hour after the addition of cycloheximide in final Ara-C concentrations of 1 or 10 ug/mL .
Fresh solutions of cycloheximide and Ara-C were prepared for each experiment .
Mononuclear cells ( 10°/mL ) from normals , patients with CML , HL-60 , or KG-1 cells were incubated at 37 °C , 10 % CO , ; /air for four to 18 hours in Alpha medium ( Flow ) containing 20 % fetal calf serum .
Four sets of cell suspensions were prepared for each incubation time : medium alone , cycloheximide alone , Ara-C alone ( three or 17 hours ) , and one hour of cycloheximide , followed by incubation with Ara-C for three or 17 hours .
In all experiments , cycloheximide remained in the suspension culture during Ara-C exposure .
In three experiments , cycloheximide and Ara-C were added simultaneously for a three-hour incubation .
After incubation , each cell suspension was washed three times and plated in quadruplicate using a methylcellulose culture system at final concentrations of 1 x 10° cells per milliliter for normal bone marrow , 1 to 2 x 10'/mL for CML samples , 2 x 10 % /mL for HL-60 , and 2 x 10*/mL for KG-1 cells .

CYCLOHEXIMIDE PROTECTS CFU-GM FROM Ara-C mean for the controls are : normal bone marrow , 88 + 14/10 '' cells ; CML peripheral blood 424 + 217/2 x 10° cells ; HL-60 , 73 + 13/2 x 10° cells ; KG-1 , 32 + 14/2 x 10° cells .
Statistical comparisons were performed using the paired Student 's ?
test .
RESULTS Normal bone marrow .
- Exposure of normal bone marrow mononuclear cells to cycloheximide for one hour before treatment with Ara-C significantly increased the percentage of surviving CFU-GM ( Table 1 ) .
Exposure to 1 ug/ml of Ara-C for three hours resulted in less than 50 % colony survival , which increased if cells were pretreated with cycloheximide at 1 ug/ml and significantly increased with 10 ug/ml ( P < .02 ) .
Similarly , toxicity from a higher-dose Ara-C exposure ( 10 ug/ml ) could be ameliorated by one hour of pretreatment with cycloheximide at 1 ug/ml ( P < .01 ) or 10 ug/ml ( P < .001 ) .
Cycloheximide itself was only minimally toxic to CFU-GM at this duration of exposure .
When Ara-C exposure was increased from three hours to 17 hours , significant protection was still afforded if cells were treated with cycloheximide for one hour before addition of Ara-C .
However , with the increased exposure time , cycloheximide itself was toxic at the higher concentration .
Ara-C cytotoxicity at 1 ug/mL was reduced with significantly increased colony survival when cells were preexposed to cycloheximide at 1 ug/mL ( P < .005 ) .
Colony survival after a 17-hour , 10 ug/ml Ara-C incubation could be increased with cycloheximide at both 1 ug/mL ( P < .01 ) or 10 ug/ml ( P < .05 ) .
In three experiments , increasing cycloheximide preexposure from one hour to six hours resulted in no additional protective effect .
Simultaneous addition of cycloheximide and Ara-C failed to yield any protective effect .
In cultures with 1 or 10 ug/ml Ara-C and no cycloheximide , the percentage of CFU-GM survivals were 45 % + 7 % and 12 % + 6 % , respectively .

Chronic myelogenous leukemia .
Cycloheximide pretreatment of mononuclear cells from nine patients with CML failed to protect CFU-GM from Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity ( Table 2 ) .
A three-hour Ara-C exposure at 1 ug/mL yielded 26 % + 50 % colony survival , which was not increased , but was , on the contrary , significantly decreased when cells were pretreated for one hour with cycloheximide at 1 or 10 ug/ml .
With a higher Ara-C dose ( 10 ug/mL ) , preexposure to cycloheximide was minimally toxic at 1 ug/mL but was toxic at 10 ug/ml .
Acute leukemia cell lines HL-60 and KG-1 .
- Pretreatment of HL-60 cells for one hour with cycloheximide failed to protect clonogenic cells from toxicity induced by a three-hour exposure to Ara-C ( Table 3 ) .
In five experiments , cycloheximide alone at 1 ug/mL was nontoxic ( mean CFU-GM survival 91 % + 11 % ) .
As in the experiments using CML cells , cycloheximide decreased colony survival at both 1 and 10 ug/mL Ara-C. Increasing exposure to Ara-C to 17 hours decreased the percentage of CFU-GM survival .

832 tive effect of cycloheximide was observed , and cycloheximide cytotoxicity appeared additive with Ara-C. A comparison of CFU-GM survival results with three-hour Ara-C incubation for normal bone marrow , CML blood , and HL-60 cells is shown in Fig 1 .
In two experiments with KG-1 cells using a three-hour Ara-C exposure , cycloheximide at 1 ug/mL ( nontoxic , CFU-C survival 105 % ) did not protect CFU-GM .
Survival of CFU-GM was 20 % with 1 ug/mL Ara-C alone and 17 % with preexposure to cycloheximide ; 17 % with 10 ug/ml Ara-C alone and 13 % with cycloheximide posure .
DISCUSSION The data presented here demonstrate that cycloheximide pretreatment reduces Ara-C toxicity on normal human bone marrow CFU-GM , in some instances by twofold to threefold .
Similar cycloheximide treatment of CML or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cell lines failed to increase colony survival and in fact enhanced the toxicity of Ara-C .
These results suggest that cycloheximide might improve the therapeutic index of Ara-C .
While previous studies have shown that protein synthesis inhibitors protect rat intestinal crypt cells , '' rat bone marrow , * '' and chinese hamster ovary cells® from cytotoxic agents , this study is , to our knowledge , the first to demonstrate such an effect on human hematopoietic cells* ' and the first to show cycloheximide 's differential protection of normal v malignant cells from a cytotoxic agent in a human cell culture system .
The mechanism of action of cycloheximide in affecting Ara-C cytotoxicity has not been specifically evaluated in our study but could be ascribed to its cell cycle effect .

SLAPAK , FINE , AND RICHMAN cells , initiation of DNA synthesis is preceded by synthesis of a labile protein . ''
Treatment with cycloheximide arrests normal cells in G1 , probably by preventing the synthesis of this labile protein . ''
Data suggest that transformed cells lack this stringent control and may not be as susceptible to cycle arrest , '' '' '' ' perhaps because the la bile protein is not necessary , acquires increased stability , or is synthesized at an increased rate . '' ''
Baseline differences between normal and malignant myeloid progenitors in the kinetics of cell proliferation or in drug metabolism may play a role in the differential protection of normal cells observed .
However , it is likely that pretreatment of normal cells with cycloheximide arrests the cells in G1 , protecting them from S-phase specific agents , while malignant cells may not be arrested and proceed from G1 to S with subsequent susceptibility to Ara-C-induced destruction .
L-Asparaginase , a protein synthesis-inhibiting enzyme that is useful in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia , has been shown to exhibit schedule-dependent synergy with Ara-C on L5178Y murine leukemia when Ara-C treatment is followed by asparaginase .
Pretreatment of cells with asparaginase antagonizes the antileukemic effect of Ara-C. '' Our results , with a different protein synthesis inhibitor , using an in vitro human system failed to show this type of antago-nism .
Whether Ara-C treatment followed by cycloheximide exhibits schedule-dependent synergy in our system is unknown , although our results indicate that simultaneous addition of Ara-C and cycloheximide is no different than Ara-C alone .
In animal systems , cycloheximide protection of normal cells has also been described with other S-phase specific agents , '' as well as drugs that do not work exclusively in the S-phase , '' suggesting that cycloheximide may be useful in combination with several active antineoplastic drugs as well as with irradiation . ''
If cycloheximide preferentially protected normal hematopoietic cells from alkylating agents , such as cyclophosphamide , it might prove useful in preparing remission bone marrow for autologous transfusion in acute leukemia .
At present , the options for `` purging '' residual malignant cells from harvested autologous marrow in vitro include monoclonal antibody treatment and exposure to cytotoxic drugs , such as the cyclophosphamide analog 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide ( 4-HC ) , which has been shown ( in an animal leukemia model ) to have some specificity for malignant progenitors . ''
Cycloheximide might improve the selective removal of malignant cells with 4-HC , Ara-C , or other agents .
The results of this study may have direct clinical applica-tion , since both cycloheximide and Ara-C have been used clinically in doses expected or documented to produce plasma levels approximating the 1 and 10 ug/mL used in vitro . ''
In addition , intravenous cycloheximide had limited toxicity when evaluated as an antipyretic agent in Hodgkin 's dis-ease . ''
Our data show that short-term exposure to cycloheximide is minimally toxic to normal CFU-GM and protects these normal progenitors from the cytotoxicity of Ara-C , one of the most active drugs used in the treatment of myeloid leukemias .

CYCLOHEXIMIDE PROTECTS CFU-GM FROM Ara-C pluripotential stem cell can not be fully determined with current techniques .
However , in autologous bone marrow transplantation , a direct correlation has been documented between total CFU-GM infused and rapidity of granulocyte recovery , suggesting that protection of CFU-GM could at least enhance granulocyte recovery . ''
Successful treatment of leukemia in vivo requires complete erradication of malignant clones with survival of sufficient normal stem cells to repopulate the hematopoietic system .
The present study suggests that combination therapy with cycloheximide and 833 Ara-C might preferentially destroy the abnormal clones and decrease the degree of myelosuppression associated with intensive antileukemia therapy .
