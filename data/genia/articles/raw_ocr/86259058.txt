LTR was preferentially transcribed in the extracts of MT-2 although the other three genes were transcribed with relatively constant efficiencies in different extracts .
The results agree well with the previous in vivo studies on the promoter activity of HTLV-I LTR .
Mixing of HeLa and MT-2 extracts revealed the presence of a LTR-specific stimulating activity in MT-2 extracts .
INTRODUCTION Human T-lymphotropic retrovirus type I ( HTLV-I/ATLV ) is an etiologic-al agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) which is a unique malignancy of a helper subset of T-cells ( 1-3 ) .
HTLV-I , HTLV type II ( HTLV-II ) , and bovine leukemia virus ( BLV ) share common structural and biological fea-tures , comprising a family ( HTLV-BLV ) of transforming retroviruses .
The genomes of these viruses do not contain typical one genes and do not seem to activate cellular one genes by promoter insertion ( 4 ) .
They are structurally unique among retroviruses in possessing extra sequences called `` px '' cal of nonacute leukemia viruses ( 4,5 ) .
Transcription of the viral long in the virus genome , in addition to the gag , pol , and env genes typi- terminal repeats ( LTR ) of these viruses seems to be activated by transacting factors in infected cells ( 6-10 ) .
Studies on the mechanism of trans-activation of LTR is important for understanding not only the regulatory mechanism of tissue-specific gene expression but also the molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis by the T-lymphotropic retroviruses .
Recent DNA transfection experiments by several groups suggested direct or indirect involvement of a pX gene product in © IRL Press Limited , Oxford , England .
4779 Nucleic Acids Research the trans-acting transcriptional activation of HTLV-LTR ( 6 , 10-12 ) .
However , the mode of the activation is unknown ; it is unclear whether the pX product activates transcription directly by recognizing the LTR sequences or indirectly by modifying other cellular components .
Since the in vivo assay system using DNA transfection is not suitable for elucidating the detailed molecular mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of the viral LTR , we reconstituted a cell-free system which allowed cell-specific transcription of the HTLV-I LTR promoter .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed human B-cell line CESS ( 14 , P. Ralph ) and HTLV-I infected human leukemic T-cell lines , MT-l ( 15 ) and MT-2 ( 16 ) , were grown in RPMIl640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum .
HeLa cells were grown in suspension culture in Eagle 's minimal essential medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum .
Preparation of whole cell transcription extracts from these cell lines and in vitro transcription in these extracts were carried out according to the procedure of Manley et al .
( 17 ) .
A standard transcription reaction mixture ( 25 ul ) contained ; 12 mM Hepes ( pH 7.9 ) , 7.5 mM MgCl , , 60 mM KCl , 60 pM EDTA , 1.2 mM dithiothreitol , 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , 10 mM creatine phosphate , 500 yM each of unlabeled nucleotide triphosphates ( ATP , CTP and UTP ) , 50 uM [ a-32P1GTP ( 10 uCi ) , 200 ug of whole cell extracts and 1 ug of cleaved plasmid DNA ( optimum concentration ) .
Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 60 min .
Reactions were stopped by the addition of 150 ul buffer containing 1 % Sarkosy1l , 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 10 mM EDTA and 40 ug tRNA ( 18 ) .
The samples were extracted with phenol and chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol ( 24:1 ) and the extracts were precipitated by ethanol .
RNAs were electrophoresed in 5 % polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel at 50 volt/cm and the dried gels were autoradiographed .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Construction of template DNA Template plasmids were constructed so that the lengths of the in vitro run-off products were between 300 and 600 bases .

To study specificity of transcription reactions catalyzed by various cell extracts , we also constructed plasmids containing three other well-characterized class II genes ; the major late gene of Adenovirus 2 ( Ad2ML ) ( 19 ) , the mouse B-globin gene ( 20 , 21 ) , and the mouse immunoglobulin VH1Ol gene ( 22 ) which should produce transcripts of about 560 bases , 470 bases , and 540 bases , respectively , when cleaved with restriction enzymes indicated in Fig .
1. pAd2 SmaI-F was digested with Smal to yield two separate fragments of the insert and vector , and their mixtures were used as a template .
All the other plasmids were linearlized by digestion with restriction enzymes indicated and used as templates .
Sizes of all the templates are about the same .
Preferential transcription of HTLV-I LTR in MT-2 extracts Optimal amounts of different template DNA were approximately equal at molar basis except for the Ad2ML promoter most active at a one-third 4781 Nucleic Acids Research M sume -a 622 « west -as 527 -* -= 309 Fig .

In vitro transcription in HeLa , CESS , MT-1 or MT-2 cell extracts .
RNAs were synthesized in the conditions containing ( A ) HeLa , ( B ) CESS , ( C ) MT-1 , or ( D ) MT~2 cell extract .
Equal amounts ( 1 ug ) of truncated DNAs were added as follows ; lane 1 , Smal-cleaved pAd2 SmaI-F ; lane 2 , BamHI-cleaved pMBG2 ; lane 3 , HindIII-cleaved pVH1O1 ; and lane 4 , HindIII-cleaved pU3RU5S .
Approximate molar ratios of pAd2 Smal-F DNA to other DNAs were 0.3 .
Exposure time was 8 hr for ( A ) , ( B ) and ( C ) , and 36 hr for ( D ) because general transcribing activity of MT-2 extract was weaker as compared with other cell extracts .

amount of the other templates ' DNA .
The optimal amount of each template was tested for its promoter activity in extracts of HeLa , CESS , MT-l or MT-2 .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the promoters of the Ad2ML gene ( lane 1 ) , $ -globin gene ( lane 2 ) and VH1Ol gene ( lane 3 ) were transcribed in all the extracts with relatively comparable efficiencies .
All the three templates were transcribed less efficiently ( about 20 % ) in MT-2 extracts than in CESS , HeLa and MT-1 extracts .
However , the distinct run-off products of the HTLV-I LTR promoter were produced only in MT-2 extracts .
Densitometer tracing of the 330-base band showed that the HTLV-I LTR was transcribed in MT-2 extract at least five times more efficiently than in the other extracts .
Consequently , when the amounts of transcripts of the Ad2ML , $ -globin , VHLOl genes in the four extracts were normalized by a longer exposure of transcripts in MT-2 extracts , the HTLV-I LTR was transcribed about 25 times more efficiently than in the other three extracts ( Fig .
2 , 4782 Nucleic Acids Research lane 4 ) .
Synthesis of all the transcripts was sensitive to « -amanitin ( 2 ug/ml ) ( data not shown ) .
We obtained similar results using three different preparations of plasmid DNA and cellular extracts .
Although these data support the preferential transcription of HTLV-I LTR in MT-2 extracts , the effect might be due to different stabilities of RNA transcripts in various extracts .
To rule out this possibility , we synthesized the run-off transcripts of LTR and VH1Ol in MT-2 extracts .
The purified RNAs were incubated with Hela , CESS , MT-1 or MT-2 extracts .
After incubation , RNAs were purified again and analyzed by gel electro-phoresis .
The ratio of the two transcripts ( LTR and was constant in all the reactions ( data not shown ) , indicating that MT-2 extracts do not preferentially stabilize LTR transcripts .
We conclude , therefore , that MT-2 extracts , compared to the other cellular extracts , preferentially transcribe the LTR of HTLV-I .
The results indicate that MT-2 extracts contain a soluble trans-acting factor ( s ) that stimulates preferential transcription of HTLV-I LTR .
These observations correlate well with the previous in vivo experiments reported by several groups ( 6 , 10-12 ) that the fusion gene of the HTLV-I LTR and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene was expressed markedly more strongly in HTLV-I-infected cells expressing viral proteins such as MT-2 than in HTLV-I-uninfected or infected cells expressing little viral proteins , such as HeLa , CESS and MT-1 .
They proposed that the pX-encoded protein ( p40x or tat ) is involved in the trans-activation of LTR in HTLV-I-infected cells .
To see whether trans-acting molecules in MT-2 extracts are also active in HeLa extracts , we carried out in vitro transcription of LTR in a mixture of HeLa and MT-2 extracts with various ratios .
Although transcription of .
LTR in Hela extracts was weak ( 23 % of MT-2 extracts ) , the addition of a small portion ( 17 % ) of MT-2 extracts enhanced synthesis of LTR transcripts greatly ( 61 % of MI-2 extracts ) as shown in Fig .
3 .
The extents of stimulation were always significantly greater than the expected activities calculated by a direct contribution of MT-2 extracts added to HeLa extracts ( Table 1 ) .
LTR was transcribed in 83 % MT-2 extracts even more efficiently than in 100 % MT-2 extracts .
These results suggest that the trans-acting molecules in MT-2 coordinated with the stronger trans- , criptional machinery of HeLa cells for preferential expression of the LTR promoter and that the trans-acting molecule ( s ) is limiting for LTR expres- sion in HeLa extracts .

Transcribing activities in mixtures of HeLa and MT-2 extracts .
Equal amounts ( 1 ug ) of HindIII-cleaved pVH1Ol ( A ) or HindIII-cleaved pU3RUS ( B ) was transcribed in either HeLa ( lane 1 ) , MT-2 ( lane 7 ) or mixtures of both extracts at indicated ratios ( lane 2-7 ) .
Exposure time was 8 hr for ( A ) and 24 hr for ( B ) .

The activities of HeLa and MT-2 extracts are taken from the values in lanes 1 and 7 .
Experimental activities were determined by densitometry tracing of the data shown in Fig .
3 .
Numbers are percentages of positive control ( 100 % HeLa extracts for VH1Ol gene and 100 % MT-2 extracts for LTR ) .
4784 Nucleic Acids Research In contrast , transcription of the immunoglobulin VHLIOl gene in Hela cell extracts produced the distinct run-off transcripts , the amount of which decreased gradually as the ratio of MT-2 extracts to HeLa cell extracts was increased ( lane 2-7 ) .
This is consistent with the fact that the general transcribing activity of MT-2 extracts was lower than that of Hela cell extracts ( Fig .
2 ) .
The amounts of the VHIOl gene products were in general agreement with the expected activity calculated from the por- tions of the two extracts ( Table 1 ) .
These data strongly suggest the presence of a specific trans-acting factor in MT-2 extracts and its involvement in the transcriptional activation of the HTLV-I LTR .
It is difficult to discriminate whether the LTR activation was due to the direct enhancement of transcription or the in-activation of a repressor molecule .
We do not know whether this factor is the product of the pX sequence per se or a cellular component modified by the pX product .
Our cell-free system will provide a clue to purify this factor and to study the molecular mechanism of the trans-activation of the HTLV-I LTR transcription .
