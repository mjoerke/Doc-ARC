The transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is under the control of cellular proteins that bind to the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
Among the protein-binding regions of the HIV-1 LTR is the transcription-enhancer region .
We show that at least one inducible , C1 , and one constitutive , C2 , protein can bind to the HIV enhancer in Jurkat cells .
The two proteins differ in their surface charge , since they are separable by anion-exchange chromatography .
Bivalent cations such as Mg** and Zn > * differentially affect their binding to oligonucleotides which contain the HIV-enhancer domain .
Both C1 and C2 proteins also bind to a similar sequence found in the interleukin-2-receptor « -subunit enhancer .
The inducible C1 protein was partially purified by three chromatographic steps and characterized by u.v .
cross-linking as a 47 kDa protein .
INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV- ! )
is the etiological agent of AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) [ 1,2 ] .
The virus typically infects cells expressing the CD4 receptor [ 3,4 ] .
However , the virus is able to express its gene products even when transfected into cells that do not express the CD4 receptor , such as HeLa cells [ 5 ] .
These observations imply that HIV is able to use host-cell transcriptional factors common to many cell types for its transcriptional regulation .
Deletion analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs ( CAT assays ) and DN Aase footprinting assays of the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) have revealed that at least five distinct regions are involved in the regulation of the transcription of the viral genes by interacting with cellular proteins [ 6 ] .
Among these regions , a negative regulatory element ( - 173 to -159 ) and a positive regulatory element or enhancer ( - 104 to -78 ) have been identified [ 6-8 ] .
The enhancer element is composed of two direct repeats of the sequence GGGACTTTCC [ 8,9 ] .
This sequence is identical with the « -light-chain-enhancer sequence or « B site , except that the sequence is not repeated [ 10 ] .
The « -light-chain-enhancer site is bound by a constitutively expressed protein , NF- « B , in mature B-cells .
In pre-B-cells , NF- « B is induced by lipopolysaccharide [ 10 ] .
NF- « B was recently purified from bovine spleen and shown to be a 42-44 kDa protein [ 11 ] .
Furthermore , Nabel & Baltimore [ 9 ] showed that phorbol ester plus mitogen induced a protein that is specific to a human T-cell line ( Jurkat ) and binds to the HIV enhancer element .
In their original report those authors postulated that the HIV-enhancer-specific binding protein in Jurkat cells is identical with B-cell NF- « kB .
Stimulation of Jurkat cells with lectin and phorbol esters induces the expression of both interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) and its receptor a-subunit ( IL2Ra ) .
Purified NF- « B binds to both IL2 and IL2Ra enhancer domains [ 11 ] .
However , another protein , HIVEN 86A , characterized in the same cells , was able to bind both the HIV enhancer element [ 12 ] and the IL2Ra enhancer [ 13 ] .
Two other groups have purified HIV enhancer-binding proteins from phorbol-ester-treated HeLa cells [ 14 ] and the Namalwa B-cell line [ 15 ] .
The protein purified from HeLa-cell extracts had an apparent M , of 55000-60000 , whereas the M , of the protein from the Namalwa cells was reported to be 51000 .
Therefore both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells express proteins capable of specifically binding to the HIV enhancer domain , but only mature B-cells express the NF- « B protein constitutively .
The relationship between NF- « B and other HIV enhancer-binding proteins is not yet elucidated .
Here we show that stimulation of Jurkat cells with phorbol - 12-myristate - 13-acetate ( PMA ) _ and phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) induces at least two proteins capable of binding specifically to the HIV enhancer element .
We describe the separation of these proteins and the partial purification and characterization of the major 47 kDa protein .
EXPERIMENTAL Cell culture The Jurkat T-cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) fetal-calf serum , glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin .
The cells were stimulated for 3h with 21g of PHA ( Burroughs Wellcome ) and 50 ng of PMA ( Sigma ) .
Protein extraction Whole cell extracts were obtained as described previously [ 16 ] .
The final protein extract contained 5-25 mg Abbreviations used : LTR , long terminal repeat ; HIV ( -1 ) , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ; AIDS , acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ; IL2 , interleukin 2 ; IL2Ra , IL2-receptor a-subunit ; PMSF , phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 1l3-acetate ; PHA , phytohaemagglutinin ; CRE , cyclic AMP-responsive element ; Brd UTP , 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate ; DTT , dithiothreitol .

The extraction procedure included an ( NH , ) , SO , precipitation at 50 % saturation .
Cell extracts were stored at -80 °C .
Oligonucleotides and gel-retardation assay Two synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes for detection of the HIV enhancer-binding proteins .
A 31-mer oligonucleotide or ' Tandem ' , which contains the two direct repeats of the HIV enhancer sequence from the position -107 to -80 [ 6 ] ( 5'-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG- and a 16-mer oligonucleotide or 'Mono ' , containing only the 5¢ site from the position -107 to -92 .
Two other double-stranded oligonucleotides were also synthesized : a 16-mer containing the sequence of the IL2Ra promoter from the position -270 to -255 [ 17 ] ( 5-GCAGGGAATCTCCCT-3 ' ) and _ a - 33-mer oligonucleotide containing the cyclic AMP-responsive element ( CRE ) of the human pro-enkephalin from the position -108 to -76 [ 18 ] ( 5-GGGCTGGCGTAGG-GCCTGCGTCAGCTGCAGCCC-3 ' ) .
In the u.v .
cross-linking experiments , an oligonucleotide containing the APIl/c-Jun binding site [ 19 ] was also used ( 5'-GATCCGGCTGACTCATG-3 ' ) .
The oligonucleotide probes were end-labelled with phage-T , kinase .
The gel-retardation assays were performed as follows : 5 ul of protein solution ( 0.4-200 ug ) was incubated on ice in a final volume of 20 ul of 20 mm-Tris/HCl ( pH 8.0 ) /10 % glycerol / 1 mm-DTT / 60 mm-KCI / poly- ( dI -dC ) ( 2 ug ) .
After 15 min incubation , the * % P-end-labelled oligonucleotide was added ( 100000-500000 c.p.m .
; 0.1 ng ) and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 15 min .
The bound oligonucleotide was separated from the free by electrophoresis on a 6 % ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gel in 0.25X TBE [ 22.5 mm-Tris/borate ( pH 8.0 ) /0.5 mm-EDTA ] .
The specific activity was determined as described by Yano et al .
[ 20 ] , except that the radioactivity of the bands was counted by the Cerenkov rather than the liquid-scintillation method , and the control DNA was the unbound free oligonucleotide .
The specific activity is expressed as pg of retarded radiolabelled probe/mg of protein .
Total activity was obtained by multiplying the specific activity by the total amount of protein and is therefore also expressed in pg .
H.p.l.c .
and affinity-chromatographic fractionation The whole-cell extract from 25 x 10° cells ( 400 mg of protein ) was diluted 3-fold with the column buffer [ 20 mm-Tris/HCl ( pH 8.0 ) /1 mm-EDTA ) and loaded on to a Bio-Gel TSK-DEAE-5-PW column at a flow rate of 5 ml/min .
The column was washed with twice its volume of column buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCI ( 0O-0.5 m ) .
The 5 ml fractions were dialysed against the A50 buffer and tested for their HIV enhancer-binding activity by the DNA gel-retardation assay .
The fractions containing the PMA + PHA-induced proteins were pooled ( pool 1 ; see Fig .
3 below ) and further fractionated by affinity chromatography by using a trimeric repeat of the mono oligonucleotide ( a 48-mer ) covalently bound to a CNBr-activated Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) as described in [ 21 ] .
The density of the oligonucleotide was approx .
140 ug/g of dry gel .
The proteins were loaded at a rate of 0.5 ml/min .
The M. Korner and others unbound material was washed out with 2.5 column volumes of the A50 buffer .
The bound proteins were eluted in 2 ml fractions by a discontinuous gradient of KCl ( 0.2 , 0.5 and 1.0 M ) in the presence of a 0.05 % Nonidet P40 .
After dialysing the fractions against the A50 buffer , the DNA-binding activity was assayed by the DNA gel-retardation assay .
The active dialysed fractions were pooled , and the affinity chromatography was repeated a second time .
U.v .
cross-linking The probe used for the u.v .
cross-linking experiment was prepared by following the instructions of the manufacturer ( Boehringer-Mannheim ) ; the Tandem single-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the Bochringer-Mannheim random primed DNA labelling kit mixture .
A 100 4Ci portion of [ P ] dCTP and 0.5 nmol of BrdUTP were added to the reaction mixture .
After 30 min incubation at 37 °C , 0.5 nmol of dCTP were added .
The labelled probe was purified from the free nucleotides by two passages through Sepharose G-25 .
Its radioactivity averaged 500000 c.p.m./wl .
The u.v .
cross-linking of proteins with the *°P-labelled BrdUr-substituted Tandem oligonucleotide was performed as described [ 22 ] , except that after irradiation the samples were immediately boiled in 2.5 % SDS/1 mm-EDTA/20 % glycerol/1 % 2-mercaptoethanol .
The electrophoretic separation was performed on 10 % -polyacrylamide gels as described by Porzio & Pearson [ 23 ] .
RESULTS Induction of HIV enhancer-binding proteins We first examined the capacity of proteins extracted from Jurkat cells to bind to the synthetic oligonucleotides which represented either a single copy ( Mono ) or two copies ( Tandem ) of the « B site of the HIV enhancer domain .
Both oligonucleotides formed two protein-DNA complexes , C1 and C2 , with distinct electrophoretic mobilities ( Fig .
1 ) .
The C1 complex was greatly increased by the stimulation of Jurkat cells by PMA and PHA .
This is in agreement with previously described induction of HIV enhancer-binding proteins in Jurkat cells by Nabel & Baltimore [ 9 ] .
In their study the radiolabelled probe used was much larger ( 90 bp ) compared with the Tandem oligonucleotide and included an upstream 50 bp extension .
The single « B site ( Mono ) -retarded migration was undistinguishable from that of the Tandem , suggesting that the two oligonucleotides bind the same proteins .
It is also very likely that the two potential « B sites in the Tandem oligonucleotide can not bind proteins simultaneously , since no slower migrating complex than that of C1 was seen with the Tandem .
However the length of the probe is critical , since we did not see any retardation of Mono oligonucleotides shorter than 14 bp .
This observation may be attributable to the high dissociation rate of the protein-DNA complex with short DNA probes .
The C1 complex was not affected by cycloheximide and actinomycin D treatment of Jurkat cells , suggesting that its induction is not due to protein synthesis de novo ( results not shown ) .
The C2-complex in contrast with the Cl-complex proteins appear to be constitutively active in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
1 ) .

Induction of HIV enhancer-binding proteins in Jurkat cells Gel retardation of *P-labelled Mono and Tandem oligonucleotides ( Oligo ) by proteins ( 15 ug ) extracted from PMA + PHA-stimulated ( + ) or unstimulated ( - ) Jurkat cells was performed as described in the Experimental section .

549 C2 by studying the effect of ions on their interaction with the mono probe .
Bivalent cations such as Zn** , Ca** and Mg** had differential effects on the stability of C1 and C2 complexes .
At 1 mm , inhibited the formation of the C1 complex ( Fig .
1 , lane 2 ) , whereas Mg** and Ca** did not ( Fig .
2 , lanes 5 and 8 ) .
At higher Zn* '' * concentrations ( 2 and 5mm ) Cl complex was dissociated , whereas the C2 complex was greatly augmented ( Fig .
2 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
At the same concentrations Ca®* had no effect on the stability of either C1 or C2 , whereas Mg** ( 5 mm ) had a dissociating effect on the C1 complex without affecting the C2 complex ( Fig .
2 ) .
EDTA ( 10 mm ) had no effect on the C1 complex , favoured partial dissociation of C2 complex ( Fig .
2 , lane 11 ) and efficiently abolished the dissociating effect of Mg** on the C1 complex ( results not shown ) .
C1 and C2 also differed in their sensitivity to high ionic strength , since C1 was more easily dissociated by 0.4 M-KC1 than was C2 ( Fig .
2 , lane 12 ) .
Therefore it is possible to favour selectively the binding of either Cl or C2 proteins to the HIV enhancer by manipulating the ionic composition of the reaction medium .
Isolation of the Cl-complex protein In order to isolate the inducible C1-complex proteins we performed the fractionation and oligonucleotide-binding assays in the absence of Mg** ions .
The first chromatographic fractionation was performed with DEAE-S5PW h.p.l.c .
About 70 % of the loaded proteins did bind to the column ( Fig .
3b ) .
The oligonucleotide-binding activity was found exclusively in the KCl-eluted fractions , suggesting that all the active proteins bound to the DEAE ( Fig .
3a ) .

eluted with 0.15 m-KCI and pooled ( pool 2 ; Fig .
3a ) .
The C1 proteins were eluted at higher salt concentrations ( 0.22-0.25 m-KCI1 ) ( pool 1 ) .
A third pool ( pool 3 , fractions 30-33 ) , contained both the C1 and C2 proteins eluted with 0.25-0.3 M-KCI .
The C2 and C2 ' proteins either co-migrated in the unfractionated extract or one of the two activities was generated by the fractionation procedure .
Indeed , the fractionation could possibly have eliminated an inhibitor of one of the two binding activities .
After pooling the fractions containing the same binding activities , we analysed the specificity of their binding to the *°P-labelled Mono probe by competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabelled oligonucleotides ( Fig .
4 ) .
The unlabelled Mono and Tandem oligonucleotides competed for binding to Cl and C2 ' , but not C2 .
The IL2Ra enhancer probe partially inhibited the binding of C1 and C2 ' and not C2 ( lanes 5 , 10 and 15 ) .
To check the selectivity of binding of the three pools to the « B site , we used the CRE oligonucleotide as a competitor , since it contains a binding site for the cyclic AMP-induced nuclear proteins .
The CRE oligonucleotide has no sequence similarity with the « B site ( see the Experimental section ) .
CRE probes did not compete for binding Ci and C2 ' , but partially inhibited the binding of C2 ( lanes 4 , 9 and 14 ) .
These results indicate that Cl and CZ ' binding activities are specific for binding the HIV enhancer probes , but the C2 protein complex is not .
The IL2Ra enhancer probe sequence is similar to , but not identical with , the « B site , which may explain why it appears to have a lower affinity for C1 and C2 ' binding activities ( see also Fig .
6 below ) .
The sensitivity to Mg** of fractionated C1 binding activity remained unchanged compared with the C1 binding activity from the initial extract .
C2 ' complex was also inhibited by 5 mm-Mg** , whereas C2 was not , suggesting that the C2 binding activity in the initial extract was mainly due to proteins from pool 3 ( results not shown ) .

the major induced proteins , was further purified by two-step affinity chromatography .
The activity was eluted with 0.5 M-KCl and co-migrated with the C1 complex from the unfractionated pool 1 ( Fig .
5 ) .
A single migrating activity was generated by this chromatographic step ; however , recovery after this step was superior to that obtained after DEAE h.p.l.c .
( see Table 1 ) .
One possible explanation for this enhanced yield is the elimination of an inhibitor during this chromatographic step .
Similar increases in activity were recently described during the purification of the NF- « B from bovine spleen [ 11 ] ( see the Discussion section ) .
The overall enrichment after this first affinity chromatography was 800-fold ( see Table 1 ) .
The active fractions were pooled and refraction-ated by the same chromatographic procedure .
C1 activity was eluted in two fractions with 0.5 m-KCl ( results not shown ) .
This second step resulted in a 1000-fold overall purification ( Table 1 ) , but recovery decreased from 70 to 43 % of the initial activity .
C2 ' binding activity from pool 2 was also analysed by affinity chromatography .
However , the recovery of activity after this step was too low to allow further analysis .
Molecular-mass analysis of C1 proteins by u.v .
cross-linking To determine the molecular mass of the C1 proteins , we loaded the initial extract directly on the affinity-chromatography column in the presence of 1 mM-EDTA .
The C1 binding activity was eluted with 0.5 M-KCI ( results not shown ) .
This single fractionation step permitted a 200-fold enrichment of the C1 activity .
The active fractions were then u.v.-cross-linked with *°P-labelled BrdUr-substituted Tandem probe as described in the Experimental section .
Two proteins of 47 kDa ( p47 ) and Vol .
265 60 kDa ( p60 ) were prominently labelled ( Fig .
6 , lane 1 ) .
The addition of 500-fold molar excess of unlabelled competitors differentially affected the two proteins complexed with the oligonucleotide probe .
Unlabelled Tandem probe completely inhibited the labelling of p47 and only partially inhibited p60 complex , whereas two sequence-unrelated oligonucleotides , corresponding to the CRE and API binding sites , did not inhibit the labelling of p47 , although they partially inhibited the labelling of the p60 ( Fig .
6 , lanes 3 and 5 ) .
The IL2Ra enhancer probe partially inhibited the labelling of both p47 and p60 ( Fig .
6 , lane 4 ) .
When u.v .
cross-linking was performed with the initial extract , many proteins were labelled , including p47 and p60 ( results not shown ) .
We also performed u.v .
cross-linking of 1000-fold-purified C1 binding activity by both the DEAE h.p.l.c .
and the two affinity-chromatographic steps ( see Table 1 ) .
A labelled protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa .
This difference in molecular mass is probably due to partial proteolysis occurring during the three-step purification .
We deduce from the u.v.-cross-linking data that the protein responsible for C1 complex-formation has a molecular mass of 47 kDa .
DISCUSSION In the present study we have shown that several proteins extracted from mitogen-stimulated Jurkat cells can interact with the « B sites that are contained in the HIV enhancer domain .
These proteins differ in the extent of their migration during non-denaturing - gel electrophoresis after binding with oligonucleotides .
They also differ in their ionic requirements for stable interaction with the oligonucleotides .
The effect of Mg** on C1 and C2 activities is summarized in Table 2 .

negative effect of Mg** on the interaction of the inducible C1 DNA-binding activity suggests a regulatory mechanism for this protein , because Mg** has been also shown to inhibit transcription assays in vitro with the SV 40 enhancer which contains the « B site [ 24 ] .
The in-hibitory effect of Mg** is not understood , but it could cause conformational changes of DNA-binding proteins .
Using two different chromatographic fractionation procedures we partially isolated an inducible DNA-binding activity C1 and identified it as a 47 kDa protein ( p47 ) .
The C2 ' protein ( s ) were eluted from DEAE at lower salt molarity than was C1 , but exhibited the same Mg**-sensitivity as C1 ( Table 2 ) .
It is not clear whether the protein ( s ) responsible for C2 ' electrophoretic mobility are related to p47 .
C2 ' could be a proteolytic product of p47 or it may be a modified form of p47 ( perhaps due to phosphorylation of C1 ) .
The induction of active NF- « B in T-cells has been attributed to dissociation from a cytoplasmic inhibitor , IxB [ 28 ] , which allowed the translocation of NF-KB into the nucleus and subsequent activation of transcription of IL2 and IL2Ra genes .
P47 also might be associated with an inhibitor , since its fractionation from the whole-cell extract by affinity chromatography increased binding activity ( see the Results section , in particular Table 1 ) .
Several cellular and viral genes , including the « light chain , SV 40 , $ -microglobulin and IL2ra , have been shown to contain « B sites in their regulatory regions [ 10,11,13,20 ] .
In HIV-1 , SV 40 , « light chain and # -microglobulin , the « B site was shown to regulate gene 1990 Human immunodeficiency virus enhancer-binding proteins Lane ... 1 2 3 4 5 10-3 x M , < G 43 30 Fig .

Some « kB-site-binding proteins were isolated and partially characterized .
For example NF-xB , a 42-44 kDa protein , was purified from bovine spleen cells [ 11 ] , HIVEN 86A , a 86 kDa protein , was found in mitogen-stimulated Jurkat cells [ 12 ] , EBP-1 , a 55-60 kDa protein , was purified from phorbol-ester-treated HeLa cells [ 14 ] , and H2TFI , a 48 kDa protein , was purified from murine thymoma cells [ 20 ] .
NF- « B is constitutively expressed only in mature B-cells , where it regulates the transcription of « light chain , but it is also inducible in T-cells , where it might regulate transcription of IL2 and IL2Ra « { 11,13,26,27 ] .
At present we have not identified with certainty a cellular enhancer for p47 , since it binds IL2Ra enhancer probe with much lower affinity than HIV-1 enhancer probes , at least in the assays in vitro used in the present study .
In our experiment we found that p47 differs in size Vol .
265 553 from the previously described Jurkat-cell HIV enhancer-binding protein , HIVEN 86A [ 12 ] , as well as from the HeLa-cell HIV enhancer-binding protein , EBP-1 [ 14 ] .
However , its size is comparable with NF- « B isolated either from bovine spleen cells ( 42-44 kDa ) [ 11 ] or a human B-cell line ( 51 kDa ) [ 15 ] , as well as with the 48 kDa H2TFI or KBFI [ 20 ] .
It is not clear whether p47 , NF- « B and H2TFI are products of the same gene with different post-translational modifications or whether they result from the expression of different genes .
It is not unusual for several different proteins to recognize the same DNA sequence .
Indeed , the mammalian transcription factor c-Jun/AP1 , the yeast GCN4 and several other mammalian and yeast proteins all bind to the same consensus sequence ATGA ( C/G ) TCAT ( see [ 25 ] for review ) .
H2TFl and NF- « B differ by their « B-site-binding characteristics [ 11,29 ] .
However , the relation between p47 , NF- « B , H2TFI , EBP-1 and HIVEN 86 A is not clear .
In spite of several described differences such as molecular mass , affinities for « B site and modulation of the binding to « B site by nucleotides , NF- « B , H2TFI and p47 could be structurally related .
The specificity of their transcriptional activity could be due to different post-translational modifications or to interaction with other , cell or signal , specific proteins .
