Koellet From the * Virginia Mason Research Center and the *University of Washington School of Medicine , Seattle , Washington 98101 Summary The association of specific HLA-DQ alleles with autoimmunity is correlated with discrete polymorphisms in the HLA-DQ sequence that are localized within sites suitable for peptide recognition .
The polymorphism at residue 57 of the DQB1 polypeptide is of particular interest since it may play a major structural role in the formation of a salt bridge structure at one end of the peptide-binding cleft of the DQ molecules .
This polymorphism at residue 57 is a recurrent feature of HLA-DQ evolution , occurring in multiple distinct allelic families , which implies a functional selection for maintaining variation at this position in the class II molecule .
We directly tested the amino acid polymorphism at this site as a determinant for peptide binding and for an-tigen-specific T cell stimulation .
We found that a single Ala- > Asp amino acid 57 substitution in an HLA-DQ3.2 molecule regulated binding of an HSV-2 VP-16-derived peptide .
A complementary single-residue substitution in the peptide abolished its binding to DQ3.2 and converted it to a peptide that can bind to DQ3.1 and DQ3.3 Asp-57-positive MHC molecules .
These binding studies were paralleled by specific T cell recognition of the class II-peptide complex , in which the substituted peptide abolished T cell reactivity , which was directed to the DQ3.2-peptide complex , whereas the same T cell clone recognized the substituted peptide presented by DQ3.3 , a class II restriction element differing from DQ3.2 only at residue 57 .
This structural and functional complementarity for residue 57 and a specific peptide residue identifies this interaction as a key controlling determinant of restricted recognition in HLA-DQ-specific im- mune responses .
HC class II proteins act as peptide-binding molecules for presenting antigenic peptides to T cells .
Both peptide sequence-specific and peptide sequence-nonspecific interactions with the MHC molecules contribute to the stabilization of the MHC-peptide complex ( 1-3 ) .
Interactions of peptide main-chain carbonyl and amide groups with MHC residues by hydrogen bond and Van der Waals force provide the free energy for sequence-nonspecific binding .
Interactions of peptide side chains with polymorphic residues within the binding pockets of the MHC impose peptide-binding specificity , which varies for different MHC molecules .
X-ray crystallography of one of these MHC molecules , HLA-DR 1 , indicated there are four major binding pockets in the DR1 molecules , termed pockets 1 , 4 , 6 , and 9 ( 3 , 4 ) , which accommodate specific anchor residues from the peptide .
Much of the sequence polymorphism among HLA-DR alleles clusters in these pockets , providing the structural basis by which different molecules bind and present different antigens .
Preferential interactions between polymorphic pockets and specific anchor residues create peptide `` mo-tifs '' in which the pattern of residues within a peptide sequence dictates its preferential MHC binding partner ( 5-7 ) .
1253 In contrast to HLA-DR , binding motifs for HLA-DQ molecules remain largely unknown ( 8-10 ) , although polymorphisms in binding pockets that distinguish among DQ molecules are associated with several autoimmune diseases , including type 1 diabetes mellitus ( 11 , 12 ) .
In particular , the HLA-DQ3.2 molecule , highly associated with disease , is highly homologous to two naturally occurring alleles , HLA-DQ3.1 and HLA-DQ3.3 .
These three DQ molecules have identical DQa chains ( DQA1*0301 ) and DQB chains with extremely high amino acid sequence similarity ; the DQ3.2 and DQ3.3 B alleles ( DQB1*0302 and DQB1*0303 , re-spectively ) differ only in an Ala- > Asp polymorphism at codon 57 , whereas the DQ3.1fB allele ( DQB1*0301 ) encodes Asp 57 and three additional polymorphisms at positions 13 , 26 , and 45 .
The aspartic residue in DQ3.1 and DQ3.3 likely interacts with an arginine at residue 79 of the DQA1 chain to form a salt bridge by analogy with a similar structure in HLA-DR1 ( 3 ) , whereas DQ3.2 lacks this interac-tion .
An influence of this potential salt bridge in DQ on peptide binding has been suggested ( 13 ) but not yet directly tested .
We have analyzed these three different DQ alleles to examine peptide-binding specificity to DQ molecules in J. Exp .

A peptide-spe-cific , DQ3.2-restricted T cell clone was also used to assess the functional consequences of modulating peptide binding on TCR interaction with the DQ-peptide complex .
Materials and Methods Cell Lines .
- EBV-transformed B cell lines were obtained from the X International Histocompatibility Workshop .
The VP16-restricted T cell clone 2A.334 was derived from the HSV-2 lesion of a patient ( HLA DQA1*0301/DQB1*0302 , DQA1*0103/ DQB1*0603 ) with herpetic vesicles .
Briefly , cells from herpetic vesicles were centrifuged through Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient ; 10° cells were stimulated in bulk with 1.5 X 105 allogeneic irradiated PBMC in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inacti-vated pooled human serum , 1 % penicillin-streptomycin , 2 mM L-glutamine , PHA ( 0.4 pg/m ! l ) , and human IL-2 ( 50 U/ml ; Schi-aperelli Biosystems , Fairfield , NJ ) ( 14 ) .
After 16 d of growth , 5 X 10° cells were restimulated with HSV-2 antigen and 5 X 10° autologous irradiated PBMC in 1-ml cultures , and 10-12 d later they were cloned at 1 cell/well using PHA , IL-2 , and allogeneic feeder cells ( 15 ) .
Clones judged to have HSV-2 type-specific responses ( stimulation index with HSV-2 antigen > 4.0 and no specific stimulation with HSV-1 antigen ) were screened for reactivity with HSV-1 X HSV-2 intertypic recombinant virus RP-2 .
HSV-2 type-specific T cell clones reactive with RP-2 are specific for VP16 ( 16 ) .
Peptide-binding Assays .
10° EBV-transformed human B cells ( PRIESS , DQ3.2 ; PF , DQ3.1 ; HID , DQ3.3 ) were incubated with 0.5 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min and washed three times in HBSS .
Cells were then resuspended with 10 jwM biotinylated peptide in 150 mM citrate-phosphate buffer , pH 4.4 , 1 mM PMSF , in a 100 pl reaction volume for 24 h at 37°C .
Cells were washed twice in HBSS before lysis in 100 ul buffer containing 0.5 % NP-40 , 0.15 M NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , and protease inhibitors .
The lysates were cleared by centrifugation , and then transferred to 96-well plates precoated with 10 ug/ml mAb SPVL3 ( specific for HLA-DQ ) and blocked with 5 % FCS in PBS .
The lysate was neutralized with 100 pl of 50 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , containing 0.02 % n-dodecyl B-p-maitoside and incubated overnight at 4°C .
The wells were then washed with PBS containing 0.02 % Tween 20 .
Europium-labeled streptavidin ( Wallac , Gaithersburg , MD ) was added in the presence of 200 pl DELFIA assay buffer ( Wallac ) and incubated at 4°C for 4 h. After washing , 200 pl of enhancement buffer ( Wallac ) was added , and the resultant fluorescence was measured using a DELFIA 1232 fluorometer .
Peptides were provided by Drs .
R. Burke and M. Tigges ( Chiron Corp. , Emeryville , CA ) or synthesized as previously described ( 17 ) .
Cytotoxic T Cell Assays .
10° target cells were incubated with 125 Ci `` Cr and 0.005-5 pg/ml of peptide for 90 min at 37°C .
Cells were washed and plated at 3 X 10° cells/wells into 96-well U-bottom plates .
Cloned T cells were added at an E/T ratio of 20:1 , with a final volume of 200 pul/well with or without 10 pug/ ml mAb SPV L3 or L243 ( specific for HLA-DR ) .
After 4 h at 37°C , 30 pul of supernatant was counted using a scintillation counter ( Lumaplates and Topcount ; Packard , Meriden , CT ) .
Results are reported as percentage of specific lysis , defined as [ mean experimental cpm - mean spontaneous cpm ) / ( mean maximum cpm mean spontaneous cpm ) ] X 100 .
Assays were performed in tripli-cate , and spontaneous release was usually < 30 % of total release .
Proliferation Assays .
T cells ( 10*/well ) and autologous irradiated PBMC ( 105/well ) as APC were added to a final volume of 1254 200 ul of T cell medium in 96-well U-bottom plates .
Peptide was used at a final concentration of 5 ug/ml .
After 3 d , [ } HJthymi-dine ( 1 pCi/well ) was added for 18 h ; cells were harvested with a semiautomatic harvester and counted by liquid scintillation .
Stimulation index is defined as mean cpm of [ H ] thymidine incorporation for antigen/mean cpm of [ *H ] thymidine incorporation for control antigen .
Results and Discussion The T cell clone 24.334 , reactive with VP16 , was identified by screening HSV-2 type-specific clones with a panel of HSV-1 and HSV-2 intertypic recombinant viruses ( 16 ) .
The specificity of CD4* T cell clone 2A.334 was defined using a set of overlapping peptides corresponding to amino acids 410-469 of VP16 of HSV-2 , the region of maximum sequence divergence between HSV-2 and HSV-1 .
Initial screening by proliferation assay using overlapping 15-mer peptides identified reactivity to VP16 430-444 ( Fig .
1 4 ) .
Subsequent analysis of cytolytic activity using 13-mers derived from this sequence demonstrated reactivity with 433-445 , but not 429-441 , defining an epitope included within the sequence DMTPADALDDFDL ( Fig .
1 B ) .
Fig .
1 C summarizes the restriction pattern of this clone , which recognized the VP16 433-445 peptide of HSV-2 presented by DQA1*0301/DQB1*0302 ; the cytolytic activity of the clone was inhibited by the anti-DQ mAb SPVL3 but not by the anti-DR mAb L243 .
Since neither DQB1*0301 nor DQB1* 0303 presented the HSV-2 peptide to clone 2A.334 , we tested these alleles in peptide-binding assays with peptide 433-445 .
Fig .
2 A shows that the peptide bound DQBI1* 0302 , but not DQB1*0301 nor `` 0303 .
Since the DQ3.3 molecule differs from DQ3.2 only in an Ala- > Asp 57 poly-morphism , this directly correlates variation at this residue with altered peptide binding .
To determine which residues on the HSV-2 peptide likely interact with the codon 57 residue , we synthesized modified HSV-2 peptides that reconstituted binding to the DQ3.1 and DQ3.3 alleles .
These peptide analogues were based on two assumptions : ( a ) that peptide-binding pockets in DQ and DR molecules should be fairly homologous , and ( b ) that the HSV-2 peptide is held in an extended conformation , similar to the extended conformation of the HA307-319 peptide in DR1 ( 3 ) .
In this scenario , an anchor residue in position n of the peptide should fit into pocket one , and residues n + 3 , n + 5 , and n + 8 should interact with pockets 4 , 6 , and 9 of the DQ molecule , respectively .
In this model , AspS57 residues may influence pocket 9 of the DQ3.1 and DQ3.3 alleles by forming a salt bridge with Arg79 of the DQa chain .
The DQ3.2 molecule , however , has an alanine at codon 57 ; there are both steric and charge implications of this poly-morphism , including the likelihood that the positively charged Arg79 may interact with negatively charged residues from bound peptide in the absence of the Asp57 salt bridge .
The sequence of the HSV-2 433-445 peptide is consistent with this model : methionine at position 434 may act as an anchor residue for pocket 1 , and aspartic acid at position HLA-DQB1 Codon 57 Is Critical for Peptide Binding and Recognition pi os 10 s do 30 100 300 1.000 stimulation index none 425-439 f 425-437 VP16 peptide 420-441 433-445 0 10 0 20 0 ao 0 40 0 so = so % specific release C % specific release at DQB1*0302 DQB1*0302 433-445 DQB1*0302 433-445 L243 DQB1*0302 433-445 SPVL3 DQB1*0303 DQB1*0303 433-445 DQB1*0301 DQB1*0301 433-445 DQB1*0603 433-445 som '' Cw C* % C # Figure 1 .

Peptides were used at 5 pg/ml for both proliferative ( A ) and *'Cr release assays ( B and C ) .
442 , corresponding to the n + 8 residue , may interact with pocket 9 .
To test this hypothesis , the HSV-2 10A peptide was synthesized with D- > A substitution at position 442 ( n + 8 ) and tested for the ability to bind to the DQ3.1 , DQ3.2 and DQ3.3 molecules .
As shown in Fig .
2 B , the HSV-2 10A peptide bound to both DQ3.1 and DQ3.3 but did not bind to DQ3.2 , giving a pattern reciprocal to the wild-type HSV-2 433-445 peptide ( Fig .
2 A ) .
This identifies residue 442 as a key anchor for binding to the three DQ alleles , complementary to the effect of the polymorphism at codon 57 .

at position 442 as anchoring residues for pocket 1 and pocket 9 , respectively , additional HSV peptide analogues were syn-thesized .
HSV-2 2L and HSV-2 2R contain an L and an R substitution at position 434 , respectively , whereas HSV-2 10E and HSV-2 10L have an E and an L substitution at position 442 , respectively .
These HSV -2 peptide analogues were tested for binding to DQ3.2 , DQ3.3 , and DQ3.1 B-LCLs , as shown in Fig .
3 .
The conservative M-L substitution at position 434 ( HSV-2 2L ) had little influence on binding to DQ3.2 compared with the native HSV-2 433-445 peptide , whereas there was a substantial decrease in binding with the more drastic M-R substitution in the HSV-2 2R peptide ( Fig .
3 A ) .
Similarly , a conservative E substitution at position 442 ( HSV-2 10E ) bound to DQ3.2 much better than HSV-2 10L .
As with the HSV-2 10A peptide , which failed to bind to DQ3.2 but was capable of binding to DQ3.1 and DQ3.3 ( Fig .
2 B ) , the HSV-2 10L peptide also bound to Brief Definitive Report A DQ3.2 HSV-2 2L HSV-2 2R HSV-2 10E HSV-2 10L l R L 1 l : a l 0 10 _ 20 _ 30 _ 40 _ 50 _ 60 fluorescence ( x10 ~ ) B DQ3.3 HSVv-2 108 | HSV-2 10L ; .

These results substantiate the assumption that in this peptide , residue 434 is the pocket 1 anchor and that a negatively charged residue at the n + 8 position is critical for allele-specific binding to DQ3.2 .
Presumably , in the absence of the Asp57 salt bridge , the negatively charged residue at position n + 8 of the peptide can interact with the accessible Arg79 of the DQa chain , and , conversely , in the presence of the salt bridge , a negatively charged residue at the n + 8 position appears to be unfavorable for peptide binding .
These HSV -2 peptide analogues were then tested for recognition by T cell clone 2A.334 .
As anticipated from the binding studies , HSV-2 2L and native 433-445 peptide stimulated clone 2A.334 with DQ3.2 B-LCL as APC ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
The HSV-2 2R peptide , however , was presented only at much higher peptide concentration ( Fig .
4 C ) , in agreement with the observation that this peptide bound less efficiently to DQ3.2 .
Peptide analogues with substitutions at position 442 were also analyzed .
Peptide HSV-2 10E ( Fig .
4 D ) was presented by DQ3.2 , like the native HSV-2 433-445 peptide .
The HSV-2 10A and HSV-2 10L ana-logues , however , showed no cytolytic recognition by clone 2A.334 on DQ3.2 target cells ( Fig .
4 , E and F ) .
These results correlated with the lack of binding of these peptides to DQ3.2 B-LCL .
However , clone 2A.334 was able to recognize the HSV-2 10A and HSV-2 10L peptides when they were presented by DQ3.3 ( Fig .
4 , E and F ) .
Thus , both HSV-2 peptides with a negatively charged residue at position 442 complexed with DQ3.2 and also HSV-2 peptides with an aliphatic side chain residue at position 442 complexed with DQ3.3 were recognized by the clone 2A.334 , indicating the generation of similar MHC-peptide complexes by the structural complementation of residue 442 and codon 57 .
Interestingly , though the HSV-2 10A and 10L peptides bound to DQ3.1 , these DQ-HSV-2 complexes were not recognized by the 2A.334 clone .
This indicates modulation of T cell recognition by the additional polymorphic sites , which are unique to DQ3.1 , and two alternative explanations are feasible .
Polymorphic residues 13 and 26 of the DQ3.1 molecule are likely to lie in the floor of the peptide-binding groove , such that the HSV-2 peptides could be presented by the DQ3.1 molecule in a different conformation because of these changes .
Similar observations have been reported by others for DR4-restricted clones ( 18 ) .
Alternatively , the DQ3.1 molecule has a bulky residue at position 45 , that , though located outisde the peptide-binding groove and the a helix , may interfere directly with interaction with the TCR .
This alternative is consistent with previous observations that residue 45 is an immu-nodominanat mAb-binding epitope on the DQ3.1 molecule ( 19 , 20 ) .
In sum , we have demonstrated a critical role for the DQB polymorphism at codon 57 as a structural and functional Figure 3 .
