Ciprofloxacin Induces an Immunomodulatory Stress Response in Human T Lymphocytes KRISTIAN RIESBECK , * ARNE FORSGREN , AGNETHE HENRIKSSON , AND ANDERS BREDBERG Department of Medical Microbiology , Lund University , Malmi University Hospital , $ -205 02 Malm6 , Sweden Received 9 February 1998/Returned for modification 13 May 1998/Accepted 3 June 1998 Exposure of cells to adverse environmental conditions invokes a genetically programmed series of events resulting in the induction of specific genes .
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin has recently been reported to upregulate interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene induction .
In the present investigation , the effect of ciprofloxacin at supratherapeutic concentrations on immediate-early ( < 2 h ) gene expression in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied with Northern blots .
In addition , transcriptional activity of IL-2 and metallothionein enhancer and promoter regions and transcription factors AP-1 , NF-KB , and NF-AT were analyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , respectively .
The concentration of c-fos , c-jun , c-myc , junB , and fra-1 mRNAs was increased in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes incubated with ciprofloxacin compared to that in untreated controls .
Ciprofloxacin increased CAT activity in stimulated lymphocytes transfected with plasmids containing either the IL-2 or metallothionein enhancer .
Furthermore , among the transcription factors tested , AP-1 activity was increased in stimulated purified T helper lymphocytes incubated with ciprofloxacin compared to drug-free controls .
Taken together , ciprofloxacin increased the levels of immediate-early transcripts , enhanced IL-2 and metallothionein promoter induction , and upregulated AP-1 concentrations in primary lymphocytes , reflecting a program commonly observed in mammalian stress responses .
Fluoroquinolones , which perform their bactericidal effect by inhibiting DNA gyrase ( a type II topoisomerase ) ( 5 ) , are known to interfere with certain immune functions .
Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones at > 20 g/ml inhibit peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) cell growth by 30 to 35 % , causing impaired cell cycle progression through the S phase ( 8 ) .
Cell cycle analysis thus indicates DNA synthesis to be inhibited by fluoroquinolones at these concentrations .
Despite this adverse effect on cell growth , fluoroquinolone antibiotics at therapeutic concentrations ( between 1.56 and 6.25 mg/ml ! )
are able to enhance [ °HJthymidine incorporation two- to threefold in phytohemag-glutinin ( PHA ) -stimulated PBLs , compared to that in control cells unexposed to antibiotics , the effects being most pronounced after 4 to 5 days of lymphocyte incubation ( 8 , 38 ) .
In addition to the stimulatory effects on thymidine incorpo-ration , ciprofloxacin ( range , 5 to 80 ug/ml ) and other fluoroquinolones potentiate interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) synthesis by PHA-stimulated PBLs ( 26 , 42 ) .
Experiments with the human T-cell lymphoma cell line Jurkat and the murine equivalent EL-4 , transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter region , show that ciprofloxacin enhances IL-2 promoter activation ( 27 , 30 ) .
An earlier and stronger ciprofioxacin-de-pendent activation of the transcriptional regulation factors nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 ( NF-AT-1 ) and activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) is observed in these immortalized cell lines .
In accordance with these findings , under certain in vitro condi-tions , ciprofloxacin ( 20 to 80 pg/ml ) counteracts the effect of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A that normally inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin , causing impaired NF-AT-1 activity ( 29 ) .

1923 with a regulative pathway common to several cytokines .
In-deed , analysis of cytokine mRNAs in ciprofloxacin ( 20 to 80 g/ml ) -treated PBLs revealed that not only IL-2 mRNA is enhanced but so are an array of other cytokine mRNAs , including gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) and IL-4 ( 30 ) .
Finally , there are several reports on ciprofloxacin-dependent immunomodu-lation in vivo , strongly indicating that the cytokine upregulation observed is not an in vitro artifact ( 19 , 36 , 38 , 41 ) .
Exposure of cells to DNA-damaging agents induces numerous genes that facilitate the repair of such lesions .
This response is essential for an organism to adapt to life-threatening environmental conditions and to duplicate its genetic material with the highest fidelity .
This sensory network has been thoroughly characterized in bacteria .
Treatment of Escherichia coli with agents that damage DNA or inhibit replication ( for example , quinolone antibacterials ) induces a set of physiological responses that have collectively been called the SOS response ( 40 ) .
These responses promote cell survival , and blocking them genetically leads to DNA damage sensitivity .
Numerous genes that are transcriptionally activated in response to DNA damage have been identified , including several involved in excision repair , recombinational repair , SOS repression , mutagenesis , and cell cycle arrest .
In eukaryotic cells , a network of overlapping systems seems to be activated following exposure to DNA-damaging agents .
Many genes are induced specifically by UV and gamma rays , while others also respond to alkylating agents and to growth arrest ( 7 , 10 , 17 ) .
In several cases , the cellular response to genotoxic treatment is triggered by signal transduction pathways which are not DNA damage specific ( i.e. , many of the genes triggered by DNA damage are also induced by agents such as phorbol esters and by metabolic or oxidative stress ) ( 5 , 10 , 11 , 34 ) .
The activation of primary stress-inducible genes ( e.g. , the immediate-early expressed genes c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc ) is rapid and independent of protein synthesis , whereas 1924 RIESBECK ET AL .
secondary induced genes ( e.g. , early expressed cytokines and genes involved in DNA repair ) are expressed later and are dependent on the primary ones ( 10 , 11 ) .
The eukaryotic UV response is the most well-characterized stress-induced pathway and resembles in many ways the bacterial SOS response ( 7 , 16 ) .
Following UV exposure , the mem-brane-associated Sre tyrosine kinases are induced , leading to activation of cytoplasmic protein kinases that eventually increase AP-1 activity and induce nuclear translocation of NF-kB .
The enhancement in AP-1 activity is mediated both by induction of c-jun and c-fos expression and by posttranslational modification of c-Jun .
The majority of genes identified during a UV response are not specifically linked to DNA repair .
However , the gene product of the UV- and gamma-ray-induc-ible GADD45 gene stimulates excision repair as well as inhibits DNA replication by blocking the cell cycle at the G , checkpoint ( for a review , see reference 37 ) .
Metallothionein is another well-studied example of a UV and DNA damage-induc-ible gene ( 15 ) .
Overexpression of metallothionein protects mammalian cells against oxidative stress and can dramatically reduce the level of intracellular oxygen radicals ( 35 ) .
Topoisomerase II inhibitors have also been shown to trigger DNA damage responses ( 20 , 23 , 31 , 39 ) .
We have demonstrated that ciprofloxacin at high concentrations ( 80 pg/ml ) interferes with topoisomerase II in human lymphoblastoid Raji cells ( 2 ) .
This phenomenon , in addition to the fact that IL-2 and other cytokines are enhanced in ciprofloxacin-treated cells ( 26 , 30 ) , led us to examine whether ciprofloxacin induces a stress response in primary human lymphoid cells .
Surprisingly , ciprofloxacin superinduced both IL-2 and metallothionein gene induction in PHA-activated PBLs compared to that in untreated controls .
Ciprofloxacin was also found to increase the concentrations of immediate-early gene transcripts without influencing mRNA stability .
Finally , the transcription factor AP-1 was strongly induced by ciprofloxacin , whereas binding of NF-AT-1 and NF- « B was unaffected .
Taken together , our data indicate that the increased cytokine production observed in the presence of ciprofloxacin is most likely related to a mammalian stress response .

The fra-1 , junB , and c-myc cDNAs were kindly provided by T. Lindsten .
The IL-2- and IFN-y-specific probes and B-actin cDNA have been described previously ( 30 ) .
DNA fragments were labeled with [ « - '' °P ] dCTP ( specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol ; PB 10205 ; Am-ersham ) by random priming ( Amersham ) .
Free nucleotides were separated on spin columns ( Costar , Cambridge , Mass . )
containing Sephadex G-50 fine ( Phar-macia ) .
For transfection experiments , expression vectors MT-CAT-SV and SV-IL-2-CAT were used ( reference 30 and references therein } .

Transfections and CAT assay .
PBLs were stimulated in the presence of PHA ( 1 pg/ml ) and PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )
for 18 h before transfection by electroporation with a Gene Pulser apparatus ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , Calif. ) .
Before transfection , cells in log phase were washed in Tris-buffered saline .
For each electroporation , 10 '' cells were resuspended in 350 pl of serum-free medium and transferred to a 1-ml electroporation cuvette with a 0.4-cm space between the electrodes ( Bio-Rad ) .
After addition of 10 jg of the appropriate plasmid DNA , the samples were gently shaken and kept at room temperature for 5 min .
The samples were subjected to electroporation at 960 wF and 450 V. The pulse generated an exponential decay pulse with time constants at 36 to 43 ms .
In all experiments , cells were mixed after the transfections and aliquoted to different culture flasks .
Cells were rested for 36 h followed by addition of ciprofloxacin and 1 ug of PHA per ml .
After activation for 15 h , cells were washed , extracts were prepared , and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reaction , including separation of products by thin-layer chromatography , was performed as previously reported ( 30 ) .
No CAT activity was detected in untransfected cells with or without ciprofloxacin .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared from stimulated CD4* T cells ( 33 ) , and protein concentrations were determined with a commercial protein assay ( Pierce bicinchoninic acid reagent ; Tecator , Sollentuna , Sweden ) .
Protein extract ( 3.5 to 5.0 pg/reaction ) was mixed with 1.0 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Boehringer Mannheim ) and 5 % binding buffer ( 100 mM phosphate buffer [ pH 6.0 ] , 50 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mM EDTA , 10 mM dithio-threitol , 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.5 M NaCl , 500 ug of bovine serum albumin per ml , 20 % Ficoll ) in a final volume of 15 l. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature , a 10,000- or 15,000-cpm *°P-kinased probe ( 60 x 10~ '' to 90 x 107 '' pg ) was added , and the reaction mixtures were incubated for a further 20 min at 37°C .

RESULTS Superinduced early gene transcription by ciprofloxacin in primary lymphocytes .
We have earlier demonstrated that ciprofloxacin enhances several cytokine mRNAs , including IL-2 and IFN-y in PHA-activated PBLs incubated for 24 to 72 h ( 30 ) .
In order to characterize the early kinetics of IL-2 and IFN-y transcripts , total RNA was isolated from PHA-activated PBLs incubated with ciprofloxacin for up to 10 h. Specific cytokine mRNAs in addition to the housekeeping B-actin message were analyzed with Northern blots with radioactive cDNA probes .
At 4 to 10 h of culture , IL-2 and IFN-y mRNA levels were significantly increased in PBLs incubated with ciprofloxacin compared to in untreated controls .
Up to 2.2-fold-more IL-2 mRNA was detected in ciprofloxacin-treated cells as early as 6 h after PHA activation ( Fig .
1A ) .
A similar increase was observed when IFN-y mRNA was examined ( Fig .
1B ) .
The ciprofloxacin-dependent superinduction of cytokine mRNAs resulted in enhanced cytokine secretion ( Fig .
1C ) .
In PBL cultures incubated with ciprofloxacin , the IL-2 and IFN-y production increased 10- and 4-fold , respectively .

Kinetics of IL-2 and IFN-y gene expression in PBLs exposed to ciprofloxacin .
IL-2 ( A ) and IFN-y ( B ) mRNA concentrations were analyzed at 30 min to 10 h for human PHA-activated PBLs incubated with ciprofloxacin ( 80 pg/ml ) ( @ ) and compared to those in drug-free controls ( 0 ) .
At 24 h , IL-2 and IFN-y concentrations ( C ) in culture supernatants were analyzed .
Total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points , and Northern blotting was performed with comparable samples of RNA .
Radioactive cDNA probes specific for the indicated genes were sequentially hybridized to the filters .
Scanning densitometry data are shown .
The specific cytokine values were divided by the corresponding values for B-actin mRNA .
An arbitrary unit was defined as equal amounts of cytokine mRNA and B-actin mRNA .
No cytokine mRNA was detected in unstimulated PBL s at time zero and was set as 0 arbitrary units .
The data presented in panels A and B are representative of three independent experiments and blood donors .
( C ) IL-2 and IFN-y were analyzed with an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , respectively .
Results from four separate experiments are shown .

strated that ciprofloxacin enhances IL-2 transcriptional activity in T cells ( 27 , 30 ) .
However , those studies were performed with immortalized cell lines that in many ways differ from primary cells .
To characterize gene transcription in ciprofloxacin-treated primary lymphocytes , human PBLs were transiently transfected with a construct containing the IL-2 promoter and enhancer in conjunction with a simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) enhancer element linked to the bacterial reporter gene coding for CAT .
In addition , a CAT plasmid consisting of the metallothionein enhancer and promoter ( instead of the corresponding part of IL-2 ) was used as a control .
IL-2 promoter activity was enhanced ( i.e. , an increased CAT activity was detected in PBLs incubated in the presence of ciprofloxacin at 80 pg/ml ) ( Fig .
2A ) .
Interestingly , when metallothionein enhancer activity was examined in ciprofloxacin-treated PBLs , CAT activity was found to be upregulated .
Metallothionein expression in PHA-activated PBLs increased 2.2- and 4.3-fold at ciprofloxacin concentrations of 40 and 80 mg/ml , respectively , compared to that in controls without ciprofloxacin ( Fig .
2B ) .
The superinduced metallothionein gene activity was considerably stronger than the IL-2 gene induction .
For comparison , ciprofloxacin at 40 and 80 pg/ml increased IL-2 gene induction 1.3- and 2.1-fold , respectively .
Thus , the augmented gene transcription by ciprofloxacin was not specific for lymphocyte-derived cytokines .
Effect of ciprofloxacin on transcription factor activity in primary lymphocytes .
Since ciprofloxacin has been shown to interfere with transcription factors in the two T-cell lymphoma cell lines Jurkat and EL-4 ( 27 , 30 ) , the next step was to examine the transcription factors AP-1 , NF-AT-1 , and NF- « B in T cells purified from peripheral blood .
To exclude monocytes and B lymphocytes , CD3 * CD4 * lymphocytes ( T helper cells ) were isolated by negative selection with magnetic beads .
Total cell protein was isolated from PHA- and PMA-activated CD4 * T cells at 1 to 4 h and incubated with a °°P-labelled oligonucleotide corresponding to an AP-1 consensus binding site .
When the protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by PAGE , a distinct pattern appeared ( Fig .
3A ) .
At > 3 h of incubation , a higher level of AP-1 binding was detected in CD4* T-cell extracts purified from activated cells incubated with ciprofioxa- cin compared to that in drug-free controls .
To verify that equal amounts of protein were added to the reaction mixtures , cell extracts were also analyzed for Oct-1 binding that is considered to be invariable during the cell cycle ( not shown ) .
Mean AP-1 binding activities divided by corresponding values for Oct-1 are illustrated in Fig .
3B .
In contrast , when the same cell extracts were examined for NF-AT-1 or NF-kB binding , we did not observe any difference between ciprofloxacin-treated cells and controls incubated without any drug ( data not shown ) .
To further characterize the different proteins included in the AP-1 complex detected in T cells exposed to ciprofloxacin , supershifts were performed .
The reaction mixtures were supplemented with polyclonal antibodies directed against the specific members of the c-Fos and c-Jun families 30 min prior to addition of the radioactive AP-1 oligonucleotide .
Cytoplasmic protein isolated from the 3-h time point with ciprofloxacin , as shown in Fig .
3A , was analyzed for AP-1 components .
The upper band showed the specific AP-1 binding , as can be seen in Fig .
4 , lane 1 .
The AP-1 shift disappeared when the polyclonal antiserum against the c-Fos and c-Jun family of proteins was added , as illustrated in lane 2 ( pan-c-Fos ) and lane 6 ( pan-c-Jun ) , respectively .
Rabbit immunoglobulin , a negative antibody control , did not interfere with the specific AP-1 band ( Fig .
4 , lane 10 ) .
Interestingly , the AP-1 complex mainly consisted of the FosB , JunB , and JunD proteins .
A similar pattern , however , was seen in ciprofloxacin-free control extracts .
Taken together , the upregulated AP-1 activity observed in ciprofloxacin-treated T cells was indeed specific because it consisted of proteins from the c-Fos and c-Jun families .
Increased concentrations of immediate-early expressed mRNAs in ciprofloxacin-treated PBLs .
Metallothioneins that protect cells against oxidative stress are induced by a wide range of different stimuli , including metals and UV C radiation ( 14 ) .
The observed hyperinduced metallothionein transcription in addition to increased AP-1 activity suggested that a phenomenon similar to a stress response occurred in PBLs incubated with ciprofloxacin .
This urged us to examine the expression of c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc mRNAs , which is commonly related to mammalian stress responses .
To investigate the effect of ciprofloxacin on these immediate-early gene tran 1926 RIESBECK ET AL .

Ciprofloxacin-dependent increase of IL-2 and metallothioncin enhancer and promoter regions in stimulated PBLs .
Raw data are shown for IL-2 and metallothionein , indicated by SV-IL-2-CAT and MT-CAT-SV , respectively ( A ) .
Relative CAT activities for ciprofloxacin-treated PBL are also presented ( B ) .
PBLs were stimulated ( 1 ag of PHA per ml and 50 ng of PMA per ml ) for 18 h , at which time , cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and rested .
After 36 h , PBLs were rechallenged with 1 ug of PHA per ml and incubated with or without ciprofloxacin ( 40 or 80 pg/ml ) .
After an additional 15 h , cells were lysed and CAT activity was analyzed as described in Materials and Methods .
For quantification , areas containing the acetylated and nonacetylated forms of chloramphenicol were cut out from thin-layer chromatography plates and measured with a scintillation counter .
Six independent donors were examined on six different occasions .
Duplicates were included in all experiments .
Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean .
Values for ciprofloxacin-treated PBLs were significantly different from those of the controls .
SV-IL-2-CAT , P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 for ciprofloxacin at 40 and 80 pg/ml , respectively .
MT-CAT-SV , P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 for ciprofloxacin at 40 and 80 ug/ml , respectively .
scripts , PBLs were stimulated with PHA and incubated with ciprofloxacin ( 80 pg/ml ) , followed by analysis of steady-state mRNA levels at various time points .
No major differences were observed between ciprofloxacin-treated and control PBL s during the first 20 min of culture ( not shown ) .
However , after 30 to 120 min of incubation , more c-fos and c-jun mRNAs were detected in cells incubated with ciprofloxacin than in drug-free controls ( Fig .
5A and B ) .
The increased mRNA levels found in cells incubated with ciprofloxacin were present up to 10 h of incubation .
After 4 h of incubation , ciprofloxacin did not , however , enhance steady-state mRNA concentrations above the initial mRNA levels detected at 30 to 60 min .
In contrast to c-fos and c-jun mRNAs , c-mye mRNA was expressed earlier in ciprofioxacin-treated PBLs ( at 2 to 6 h ) than in the drug-free controls ( Fig .
5C ) .
Interestingly , the kinetics of these immediate-early induced genes were in accordance with the kinetics for IL-2 and IFN-y mRNAs , whose expression is dependent ANTIMICROB .

The steady-state cytokine mRNA levels increased at > 4 h ( Fig .
1A and B ) , a time point when the immediate-early mRNAs already had started accumulating ( Fig .
5 ) .
Thus , in ciprofioxacin-treated cells , the activated AP-1 found at > 2 h ( Fig .
3B ) paralleled the increased c-jun and c-fos mRNA steady-state levels detected at > 30 min .
Ciprofloxacin did not stabilize the immediate-early expressed gene transcripts .
To exclude whether ciprofloxacin influenced c-fos , c-jun , and c-mye mRNA degradation , ciprofloxacin with or without the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D was added to PBLs that had been stimulated with PHA for 6 h. Different mRNAs were analyzed after 2 and 4 h of the actinomycin D and/or ciprofloxacin chase ( Fig .
6 , lanes 7 to 12 ) .
Irrespective of the presence or absence of ciprofloxacin , c-myc , c-fos , c-jun , junB , fra-1 , and IL-2 mRNAs were all degraded in actinomycin D-treated cells ( i.e. , when new mRNA transcription was inhibited by actinomycin D ) .
Thus , ciprofloxacin did not influence the half-life of the immediate-early transcripts .

The superinduced AP-1 complex in ciprofloxacin-treated CD4* T cells contained proteins from the c-Fos and c-Jun families .
Cell extract from the CD4 * T cells exposed to ciprofloxacin for 3 h displayed in Fig .
3A was examined in supershifts .
The upper band shows the specific AP-1 binding ( see , for example , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
The lower band shows the unspecific binding to the AP-1 oligonucleotide sometimes observed .
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were prein-cubated with the extracts for 30 min on ice prior to addition of the AP-1 oligonucleotide .
Unspecific rabbit immunoglobulins , which were used as a control serum , are indicated by rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) in lane 10 .
The free probe ( shown in Fig .
3A ) was run out from the gel .
Similar results were obtained with the 2-h extract from control T cells shown in Fig .
3A ( data not presented ) .
The results are representative for two different blood donors .
NAs were found to be upregulated by ciprofloxacin after both 2 and 4 additional h of culture , indicating that even a short exposure to the drug resulted in increased mRNA concentrations ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1 to 6 ) .
For example , 2.6- and 2.7-fold increases of c-jun and junB mRNA levels , respectively , were detected after a 4-h ciprofloxacin pulse .
In contrast , the control mRNA , B-actin , was unaffected by ciprofloxacin .
DISCUSSION In the present investigation , we show that the quinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin induces a mammalian stress response similar to the SOS response seen in bacteria .
The extent to which the implications of the effects of fluoroquinolones on PBLs observed in the present study are of clinical interest is difficult to establish , since the effects were observed at intermediate and high quinolone concentrations not reached in CIPROFLOXACIN AND MAMMALIAN STRESS RESPONSE 1927 patients .
However , the most likely parallels can be drawn with the effects of clinically achievable concentrations of ciprofloxacin .
It is well established that ciprofloxacin and other quinolones at 5 ug/ml increase IL-2 production in both human and murine in vitro systems , but also that a maximal effect is observed at 80 ug/ml ( 26 , 38 ) .
Due to the relatively insensitive methods presently available , we did not detect any IL-2 mRNA increase at 5 pg/ml but only detected increases at 20 and 80 pg/ml ( 30 ) .
In parallel , the augmented induction of the IL-2 and metallothionein genes was observed at > 40 pg/ml ( Fig .
2 ) .
Recently published reports on immunomodulatory effects of ciprofloxacin in vivo support our hypothesis .
For example , when ciprofloxacin at clinically relevant doses was administered to sublethally irradiated mice , hematopoiesis was stimu-lated , most probably due to induction of granulocyte-macro-phage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and IL-3 ( 19 , 36 ) .
Despite the high concentrations of ciprofloxacin ( 80 pg/ml ) that were required for us to sense a significant response in vitro , augmented GM-CSF and IL-3 mRNA levels were observed in mitogen-activated PBLs exposed to ciprofloxacin ( 30 ) .
Another example of a relationship between in vitro and in vivo findings was recently published by Wrishko et al .
( 41 ) .
In their study , a pharmacodynamic interaction between cyclosporine A and ciprofloxacin was demonstrated in renal transplant patients , suggesting that the antibacterial agent may be immunomodulatory , particularly when T cells were activated ( 41 ) .
The corresponding in vitro finding , i.e. , a cyclosporine A-dependent immunosuppressive effect on cytokine synthesis counteracted by the quinolone , was observed at > 20 pg of ciprofloxacin per ml ( 29 ) .
Taken together , the collective data suggest that the upregulated IL-2 synthesis observed in PBLs incubated with low concentrations of ciprofloxacin may reflect a stress response .
However , ciprofloxacin at high concentrations was required in vitro to clearly demonstrate the relation-ship .
During treatment of mammalian cells with , for example , cytotoxic drugs or heavy metals , a stress response is generally triggered , resulting in induction of several different genes ( 10 , 11 ) .
Increased concentrations of transcriptional regulation factors ( 27 , 30 ) ( Fig .
2 ) and upregulated c-fos , c-jun , and cytokine gene transcripts in stimulated eukaryotic cells exposed to ciprofloxacin suggest that ciprofloxacin might have induced a stress response similar to a mammalian DNA damage response 160 160 160 in 140 - io 140 - 140 a @ a » © _ © _ o $ @ 120 5g 120 §§1zo g § 100 - 35 199 - < 5 199 CC go _ C C go _ { E Togo ] 2 5 c © 2 8 §§ 67 $ 8 so- # B so 42 4 * © a - a - a-© 40 - © 40 - s 40 ~ CC CC CC 20 - 20 - 20 0 T T-r-1T-T-J T 0 + 0 0 3 4 5 6 7 10 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 1 2 3 4 506 7 & 9 10 Time ( hours ) Time ( hours ) Time ( hours ) FIG .

( genotoxic stress ) .
However , since ciprofloxacin did not increase mutation frequency ( DNA damage ) in a shuttle vector plasmid mutation test ( 3 ) , direct interference with topoisomerase II might be another mechanism by which ciprofloxacin induced a stress response .
Ciprofloxacin at high concentrations ( 80 g/ml ) has in fact been shown to interfere with topoisomerase II in Raji cells when investigated by a neutral elution technique ( 2 ) .
Interestingly , the topoisomerase II inhibitor vepeside ( VP-16 ) induces vimentin expression and activates the GADD153 promoter in the monocytic cell line U-937 ( 20 , 31 ) .
In addition , vepeside affects protein kinase C in the same cell line , causing enhanced AP-1 activity , but without influencing NF-kB binding ( 23 ) .
Inhibition of topoisomerase II in thymocytes by teniposide ( VM-26 ) leads to superinduction of c-jun mRNA expression and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase , resulting in increased AP-1 activity ( 39 ) .
It has also been shown that teniposide induces the transcription of heat shock genes in HeLa cells ( 32 ) .
However , despite the fact that vepeside has been thoroughly documented to induce genotoxic stress , it did not stimulate IL-2 gene expression in our experimental models ( 28 ) .
Thus , in addition to triggering a genotoxic response , DNA-damaging agents may directly inhibit topoisomerase II , thus facilitating transcription .
This would be another mecha- ANTIMICROB .

nism that accounts for the effects seen in ciprofloxacin-treated cells .
DNA-damaging agents and genotoxic stress may also increase the stability of certain gene transcripts .
Recently it was reported that photodynamic treatment of HeLa cells resulted in the prolonged half-life of c-jun and c-fos transcripts ( 18 ) .
UV radiation or methylmethane sulfonate ( MMS ) also enhanced mRNA stability for the growth arrest and DNA dam-age-inducible ( gedd ) genes in hamster cells compared to that in untreated exponentially growing cells ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , Mal-lardo and collaborators described an extensive IL-6 and IL-1 mRNA stabilization in human monocytes incubated with the alkylating agents MMS and mitomycin ( 22 ) .
In contrast , ciprofloxacin did not appear to increase the stability of immediate-early mRNAs : no difference in mRNA turnover was detected in PBLs incubated with or without ciprofloxacin in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D ( Fig .
6 ) .
Activation of T lymphocytes results in the induction of a number of genes , such as immediate-early ( e.g. , c-fos and c-jun ) , early ( IL-2 ) , and late-response ( histone H3 ) genes ( 4 ) .
In cells incubated with ciprofloxacin , a time relationship appeared to exist between the increased c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels on one hand and the superinduced IL-2 and IFN-y mRNA concentrations on the other ( Fig .
1 and 5 ) .
In contrast to ciprofloxacin-treated Jurkat cells that display increased AP-1 concentrations at 15 min ( 30 ) , any upregulated AP-1 binding by ciprofloxacin was not detected at earlier time points than 2 h in primary lymphocytes ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , in PBLs , the upregulated expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs was not preceded by increased AP-1 activity .
The mRNAs of at least six different Fos and Jun proteins included in the AP-1 protein complex are detected in stimulated T cells ( 13 ) .
Interestingly , in our highly purified CD4* T cells activated with PHA and PMA , the induced AP-1 detected at 2 and 3 h of activation mainly consisted of the proteins FosB , JunB , and JunD ( Fig .
4 ) .
The immediate-early genes encoding members of the Jun and Fos families are tightly controlled by transcription factors other than AP-1 .
The regulation of c-fos is mediated by factors binding to a cyclic AMP -responsive element ( CRE ) , Sis-inducible enhancer ( SIE ) , and , finally , a serum-response element ( SRE ) ( see reference 16 for a review ) .
Numerous transcriptional regulation factors , including CRE-binding proteins and the signal transducer and activator of transcription factors , including CRE-binding proteins and the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) group , bind to the c-fos enhancer and promoter region .
In contrast , c-jun is induced via a tetrade-canoyl phorbol acetate-responsive element ( TRE ) , which has been proposed to be recognized by c-Jun-activating transcription factor 2 ( ATF2 ) heterodimers in addition to other presently unknown factors .
Taken together , ciprofloxacin induced transcripts consisting of members of the Jun and Fos families , resulting in dimeric protein complexes that in turn constituted AP-1 .
Depending on the composition of the AP-1 dimer , different sequence elements are preferentially recognized .
Two AP-1 binding sequences exist in the promoter of the T-cell cytokine IL-2 ( 4 , 6 ) .
In contrast to a less important distal AP-1 site , the proximal AP-1 sequence is crucial for IL-2 gene induction and represents a major site of protein kinase C responsiveness ( 14 ) .
Deletion of the proximal site diminishes the IL-2 promoter activity by approximately 75 % , compared to that of the wild type ( 6 ) .
We investigated the effect of ciprofloxacin on IL-2 promoter induction in a well-defined murine system by using different constructs consisting of mutated IL-2 enhancer and promoter regions ( 27 ) .
No upregulated CAT conversion was voL .
42 , 1998 found with an IL-2 promoter construct lacking the proximal AP-1 site in the presence of ciprofloxacin ( 25a ) .
In contrast , in experiments with IL-2 promoter constructs lacking the NFAT-1 or binding sequences , ciprofloxacin increased CAT activity regardless of the mutated sequence compared to that in drug-free controls .
Moreover , in the present study , it was shown that ciprofloxacin increased expression for both constructs MT-CAT-SV and IL-2-CAT-SV containing the promoters metallothionein and IL-2 , respectively ( Fig .
2 ) .
To reach the detection limit for CAT in primary lymphocytes , we had to include the SV40 enhancer .
It is well known that AP-1 is crucial for the activity of the SV40 enhancer and the IL-2 promoter ( 6 , 25 ) .
In contrast , AP-1 seems to be less important for the induction of the metallothioneins ( 24 ) .
When the AP-1 site was mutated in the human metallothionein promoter , the low basal activity disappeared , while the metallothionein gene still could be induced by Zn** ( 21 ) .
Unpublished observations from our laboratory reveal that in contrast to an intact promoter , the metallothionein promoter with a mutated AP-1 site ( 21 ) was not enhanced by ciprofloxacin in stimulated murine EL-4 cells .
Most likely the ciprofloxacin-dependent upregulation of MT-CAT-SV activity in PBLs was not caused by the non-AP-1-related transcription factors ( 24 ) but was due to a combination of the AP-1 binding sequences in the metallothionein promoter and the SV40 enhancer element .
Ciprofloxacin appeared to mainly interfere with AP-1 activity when transcriptional activity was examined with CAT con-structs .
In conclusion , an association between stress response and cytokine superinduction triggered by ciprofloxacin has been described in the present communication .
Several gene transcripts included in the c-Fos and c-Jun families in addition to most T-cell cytokines ( 30 ) were augmented in primary lymphocytes exposed to ciprofloxacin .
Moreover , AP-1 binding activity was increased in ciprofloxacin-treated PBLs , which is a commonly described phenomenon during mammalian stress .
Despite the available evidence of immunomodulatory effects of ciprofloxacin in vivo ( 36 , 41 ) , the clinical significance of our findings warrants further studies .
