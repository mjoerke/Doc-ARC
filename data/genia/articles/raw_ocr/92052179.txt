9804-9808 , November 1991 Biochemistry Isolation of a candidate repressor /activator , NF-E1 ( YY-1 , 8 ) , that binds to the immunoglobulin x 3 ' enhancer and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain uE1 site ( transcription /developmental control /negative regulation ) KvyounGsooKk PARK AnD MICHAEL L. AtTcHISON Department of Animal Biology , Biomedical Graduate Studies , Molecular Biology Program , University of Pennsylvania , School of Veterinary Medicine , 3800 Spruce Street , Philadelphia , PA 19104 Communicated by Robert P. Perry , August 7 , 1991 ABSTRACT We have determined that the developmental control of immunoglobulin x 3 ' enhancer ( « E3 ' ) activity is the result of the combined influence of positive- and negative-acting elements .
We show that a central core in the xE3 ' enhancer is active at the pre-B-cell stage but is repressed by flanking negative-acting elements .
The negative-acting sequences repress enhancer activity in a position- and orientation-independent manner at the pre-B-cell stage .
We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a zinc finger protein ( NF-E1 ) that binds to the negative-acting segment of the « E3 ' enhancer .
This protein also binds to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer E1 site .
NF-E1 is encoded by the same gene as the YY-1 protein , which binds to the adeno-associated virus PS promoter .
NF-E1 is also the human homologue of the mouse 8 protein , which binds to ribosomal protein gene promoters .
The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein contains features characteristic of transcriptional activators as well as transcriptional repressors .
Cotransfection studies with this cDNA indicate that it can repress basal promoter activity .
The apparent dual function of this protein is discussed .
Immunoglobulin x gene expression is tissue specific and is developmentally regulated during B-cell development at the transcriptional level .
Immunoglobulin x transcription is governed by two enhancers : one ( Ex ) lies within the intron separating the joining and constant regions , and the other ( « E3 ' ) lies downstream of the constant region ( 1-3 ) .
Both enhancers are tissue specific and both are developmentally controlled ( 3-6 ) .
That is , both enhancers are normally silent at the pre-B-cell stage but are active at the B-cell and plasma cell stages .
The activity of the intron enhancer is controlled by the presence of the active form of NF- « B ( 7-10 ) .
The 3 ' enhancer , however , does not require NF- « B for its activity ( 6 , 11 ) .
Therefore , the mechanism of its silence at the pre-B-cell stage is unclear .
Silence of the « E3 ' enhancer at the pre-B-cell stage could be due to either the lack of positive-acting factors , the presence of negative-acting factors , or both .
Previously , we functionally characterized the « E3 ' enhancer and identified a 132-base-pair ( bp ) core that retains 75 % of the activity of the intact l-kilobase ( kb ) enhancer in plasmacytoma cells ( 6 ) .
Sequences flanking this 132-bp core contribute very little to enhancer activity at this stage of B-cell development .
It is unknown whether sequences within this core are capable of being active at the pre-B-cell stage of development or whether there are negative-acting elements in the « E3 ' enhancer .
We report here that the « E3 ' enhancer 132-bp core is indeed active at the pre-B-cell stage .

9804 132-bp core we have identified a segment that represses activity of the enhancer at the pre-B-cell stage .
We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a zinc finger protein ( NF-E1 ) that binds to a DNA sequence within the negative-acting segment .
This factor also binds to the uE1 site of the heavy-chain enhancer .
The sequence of NF-E1 reveals features in common with both transcriptional activators as well as transcriptional repressors .
* Cotransfection with this cDNA results in repression of basal promoter activity .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Constructions .
Construct A contains a Bei II/Xba I DNA fragment ( residues 80-808 ) of the « E3 ' enhancer upstream of the herpesvirus thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) sequences .
Plasmids B-G were prepared either by BAL-31 deletion or by PCR amplification of appropriate portions of the « E3 ' enhancer .
Plasmid J was prepared by a PCR-based linker scan procedure ( 12 ) such that the NF-E1 sequence was changed from CCTCCATC to AGAATTCA .
Plasmids H and I were described previously ( 6 ) .
The GAL4-E1 and GAL4-rEl fusion constructs contain the insert from clone 324 in either orientation at the EcoRI site of plasmid pSG424 ( 13 ) .
SV-E1 and SV-rE1 contain the clone 131 cDNA in either orientation driven by the simian virus 40 promoter and enhancer .
Cell Culture , Transfections , and CAT Assays .
1-8 cells were grown and transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure as described ( 6 ) .
3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated horse serum ( GIBCO ) and were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method ( 14 ) .
3T3 transfections contained 4 ug of reporter plasmid , 15 ug of effector plasmid , and 1 ug of the B-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 ( 15 ) .
CAT assays were performed as described by Gorman et al .
( 16 ) .
Gel Mobility Shift and Methylation Interference Assays .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described by Singh et al .
( 17 ) .
For methylation interference assays , a 75-bp Hae III/BstNl fragment containing the NF-E1 binding site was subcloned into the HinclI site of pUCI18 .
This plasmid was cut with BamHI , dephosphory-lated with calf intestine phosphatase , and then labeled with [ y- > P ] JATP by polynucleotide kinase .
Partial methylation , binding reactions with Ag8 nuclear extract , and electropho-resis were performed as described ( 18 ) .
Screening of the cDNA Expression Library .
A human B-cell-derived Agtll cDNA library ( human B-cell leukemia RPM Abbreviations : TK , thymidine kinase ; CAT , chloramphenicol ace-tyltransferase .

In Vitro Transcription and Translation .
Clone 131 in pBlue-script was linearized with Xba I and then transcribed with T7 polymerase using an mRNA capping kit according to the manufacturer 's specifications ( Stratagene ) .
The capped mRNA was subjected to in vitro translation with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) .
RESULTS The « E3 ' Core Is Active in pre-B Cells and Is Flanked by Negative-Acting Elements , .
We set out to determine whether the 132-bp « E3 ' core is active at the pre-B-cell stage .
The 132-bp core segment was linked to the herpesvirus TK promoter driving expression of the CAT gene .
The activity of this construct was compared to that of the intact enhancer contained on a 728-bp DNA fragment ( containing 311 bp 5 ' and 285 bp 3 ' of the core ) after transfection into 1-8 pre-B cells .
The 132-bp core segment was ~10-fold more active than the 728-bp enhancer fragment in pre-B cells ( Fig .
14 , compare constructs A and I ) .
These results suggest the presence of negative regulatory elements within the 728-bp enhancer fragment that are deleted in the 132-bp fragment .
To search for these negative elements , various deletion mutants were prepared ( Fig .
1A ) .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) 9805 above that of the intact enhancer ( Fig .
14 , compare constructs A , B , and C ) .
However , progressive deletions to positions 615 , 558 , 536 , and 523 ( constructs D , F , G , and H , respectively ) resulted in stepwise increases in CAT activity .
Similar results were obtained with the pre-B-cell line 3-1 ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest the existence of multiple negative control elements that flank the 3 ' side of the 132-bp core of the « E3 ' enhancer .
To ensure that the increased enhancer activity was not due to position effects caused by the various deletions and to determine whether the negative-acting segment was position or orientation independent , constructs K-N were prepared ( Fig .
1B ) .
Construct H was modified to contain sequences 523-808 on either the 3 ' side ( K and L ) or the 5 ' side ( M and N ) of the enhancer .
All four constructs repressed enhancer activity , indicating that the negative-acting sequences are position and orientation independent ( Fig .
1B ) .
Repression ranged from 9- to 3.4-fold ( 11-29 % of construct H ) .
Identification of a Nuclear Factor That Binds to the Negative-Acting Region of the « E3 ' Enhancer .
To identify nuclear factors that bind to the negative-acting region of the « kE3 ' enhancer DNA fragments were used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
A 75-bp Hae III/BsfNI DNA fragment ( residues 582-657 ) yielded a single bound complex with nuclear extracts prepared from cell lines representative of the pre-B-cell , B-cell , and plasma cell stages ( data not shown ) .
Unlabeled DNA fragments from the « E3 ' and the heavy-chain enhancers abolished protein-DNA interaction , but a DNA fragment from the « intron enhancer had no effect ( data not shown ) .
Oligonucleotides containing known immunoglobulin enhancer motifs were also used as competitors .
An oligonucleotide containing the uE1 binding site abolished the DNA-nuclear factor interaction ( Fig .
2 Upper ) , but not oligonucleotides containing the wE2 , uE3 , uE4 , uE5 , NF-xB , or octamer binding sites ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the nuclear factor that binds to the « E3 ' probe appears to be identical to the factor that binds to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain 4E1 site .
We therefore named this nuclear factor NF-E1l .
Dimethyl sulfate methylation interference assays indicated that methylation of G residues 623 , 624 , 626 , 627 , and 630 on the bottom DNA strand of the « E3 ' enhancer interfered with NF-E1-DNA interaction ( Fig .
2 Left ) .
These residues in the « kE3 ' enhancer overlap with a region of 8 bp of identity with the heavy-chain uE1 site and closely correspond to sites identified by in vivo and in vitro uEl dimethyl sulfate footprinting ( refs .
20 and 21 ; summarized in Fig .
2 ) .
Isolation and Characterization of cDNA Clones Encoding NF-E1 .
A human B-cell cDNA library in Agt11 was screened with an oligonucleotide containing the « E3 ' NF-E1 binding sequence by the method of Vinson et al .
( 19 ) .
Of 250,000 phage plaques screened , we obtained 3 positive clones designated 131 , 324 , and 1021 .
The largest cDNA clone ( clone 324 ) was sequenced in its entirety and contains 2084 bp .
Clone 131 , although smaller than clone 324 , extended the sequence an additional 92 bp in the 5 ' direction .
The composite NF-E1 sequence spans 2176 bp and , beginning with the first ATG triplet at position 75 , encodes an open reading frame of 414 amino acids ( Fig .
3 ) .
The first methionine codon conforms well to the Kozak ( 22 ) consensus sequence .
The termination codon is followed by 860 bp of 3 ' untranslated sequence .
A polyadenylylation signal lies 4 bp upstream of the 3 ' end of the cDNA sequence .
A second potential polyadenylylation signal lies 58 bp downstream of the trans-lational termination codon .
Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed a rather unusual structure .
First , in the C-terminal portion are four zinc fingers of the Cis-Cis-His-His type .
Second , the N-terminal portion of the protein is highly acidic with 21 of the first 53 ( 40 % ) amino acids being acidic .

NF-E1l also binds to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain E1 site .

includes a portion with 11 consecutive acid residues between amino acids 43 and 53 .
The segment between residues 16 and 35 contains sequences consistent with the ability to form a negatively charged amphipathic a-helix .
This highly acidic N terminus is reminiscent of transcriptional activation domains found in other transcriptional regulators ( 23 , 24 ) .
Third , the segment between residues 70 and 80 is unusual in that it consists of 11 consecutive histidines .
The transcriptional repressor Tst-1 ( SCIP ) also contains regions rich in histidine as well as a stretch of 6 consecutive histidine residues ( 25 , 26 ) .
Fourth , the region between amino acids 154 and 198 is very rich in alanine and glycine residues ( 26 of 45 ; 58 % ) .
This region also includes a stretch of 4 consecutive serines between residues 164 and 167 .
The repressor Tst-1 ( SCIP ) also contains extensive regions rich in alanine and glycine ( 45 % ) .
In addition , the putative repressor domain in the transcriptional repressor Kruppel is rich in alanine residues ( 27 ) .
A search of the National Biomedical Research Foundation-Protein Identification Resource ( release 26 ) data base revealed homologies to numerous transcription factor IIIA-type finger proteins .
Particularly striking was a 76 % homol-ogy in the zinc finger region to the finger protein REX-1 ( 28 ) .
No data base homologies to other segments of the NF-E1l sequence were observed .

Alanine and glycine residues are underlined .
The two boxed regions denote the locations of the 11 consecutive acid residues near the N terminus and the zinc finger region at the C terminus .
Asterisk shows the location of the termination codon .
The 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated sequences are shown in italics .
The two underlined sequences in the 3 ' untranslated region indicate potential polyadenylylation signals .
The sequences of clones 131 and 324 were compared over =800 bp .
Both sequences were identical except at two locations .
At nucleotide position 268 , a G to A transition results in an arginine to histidine change in clone 324 .
In addition , a CCA codon is deleted in clone 324 between nucleotide positions 271 and 273 , resulting in the loss of a single histidine residue .
These differences presumably reflect polymorphisms of the same gene .
DNA Binding Characterization of the Cloned and Endogenous NF-E1 Proteins .
Clone 131 was transcribed and translated in vitro and the synthesized protein was assayed for binding to the « E3 ' NF-E1 DNA probe .
The in vitro synthesized protein bound to the « E3 ' NF-E1 probe and migrated with a mobility identical to the endogenous protein ( Fig .
44 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The protein-DNA complex was abolished by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the « E3 ' NF-E1 or the immunoglobulin heavy-chain 1E1 binding sites , but not with one containing a mutant NF-E1 sequence ( lanes 4-6 ) .
The zinc chelator 1,10-phenanthroline ( 29 ) abolished DNA binding by the in vitro synthesized and the endogenous proteins ( Fig .

Arrows B and F indicate the locations of the bound and free DNA probe , respectively .
Inclusion of the zinc chelator in a binding assay with a non-zinc finger protein had no effect ( data not shown ) .
NF-E1 Is a Candidate Repressor Protein .
The sequence of NF-El contains regions similar to transcriptional activators ( acid rich ) as well as to transcriptional repressors ( Ala+Gly-rich and His-rich ) .
We therefore set out to determine whether NF-E1 would exert a positive or a negative influence on the transcriptional activity of a synthetic promoter .
NF-E1 was expressed as a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( GAL4 1-147 ) and cotransfected with a TKCAT plasmid containing the GAL4 DNA binding site .
The GAL4-TKCAT plasmid exhibited readily detectable levels of basal expression in 3T3 cells ( Fig .
5 , lane 1 ) .
Cotransfection with the GAL4-E1 fusion plasmid repressed CAT levels 10-fold ( lane 3 ) , while plasmids that contained the NF-E1l sequences Proc .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) 9807 in the opposite orientation ( GAL4-rE1 ) or the GALA 1-147 sequences alone ( GAL4 1-147 ) had no effect on expression ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The above repression could be due to NF-E1l directly repressing promoter activity .
Alternatively , NF-E1 could be titrating factors necessary for promoter activity ( squelching ) .
To distinguish between these possibilities , we cotransfected the various effector constructs with a reporter plasmid that lacked the GAL4 DNA binding site ( TKCAT ) .
TKCAT expression was unaffected by cotransfection with the GAL4-E1 construct , indicating that DNA binding is necessary for the repressive activity of NF-E1 ( Fig .
5 , lanes 5-8 ) .
To ensure that the repression observed above was not due to an unusual feature of the GAL4-E1 chimera , we expressed the native NF-El cDNA without GAL4 sequences .
The NF-E1 expression plasmid ( SV-E1 ) repressed activity of a TKCAT reporter containing the NF-El binding site , ( E1 ) , TKCAT , while an expression plasmid with the NF-E1 sequence in the opposite orientation ( SV-rE1 ) had no effect ( lanes 9-11 ) .
To assess the functional role of the NF-E1 binding site in the context of the intact « E3 ' enhancer , we prepared a linker scan mutation of the NF-E1 binding site .
This construct gave a small , but reproducible , 1.3-fold activation of the intact « E3 ' enhancer in pre-B cells ( Fig .
1 4 , construct J ) .
This low level of activation was not unexpected given our evidence that the « E3 ' enhancer contains multiple negative elements ( Fig .
1A ) .
Our results are consistent with the NF-E1l site playing a negative role in « E3 ' enhancer activity rather than a positive role .
DISCUSSION We have determined that while the intact « E3 ' enhancer is silent at the pre-B-cell stage , the 132-bp core segment is active .
We have identified a region downstream of the enhancer core that contains sequences that repress enhancer activity in a position- and orientation-independent manner at the pre-B-cell stage .
We have identified a nuclear factor , NF-E1 , that binds to a DNA sequence motif within this negative-acting segment and have isolated cDNA clones encoding this protein .
NF-E1 also binds to the uE1 site of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer .
In previous studies , mutation or deletion of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain uE1 site gave ambiguous results .
In some cases , uE1 site mutation led to a decrease in immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer activity in plasmacytoma cells ( 10 , 30 , 31 ) .
In another case , no effect on enhancer activity was observed ( 32 ) .

NF-E1 represses basal promoter activity .
Above each lane the reporter and the cotransfected effector plasmid are indicated .
9808 Biochemistry : Park and Atchison mutation of the E1 site led to an increase in immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer activity in L cells , suggesting a repressive role in tissue specificity ( 32 ) .
NF-E1 also appears to bind to the c-myc promoter ( 33 ) .
In this case , NF-E1 ( common factor 1 ; CF-1 ) binds to a sequence with positive-acting properties .
In the context of the « E3 ' enhancer , we found that NF-El binds to a DNA segment with negative-acting properties in pre-B cells .
Cotransfection of NF-E1 expression plasmids with various reporter constructs resulted in repressed promoter activity ( Fig .
5 ) .
Therefore , our data are consistent with NF-E1 being a transcriptional repressor .
Somewhat surprisingly , NF-E1 binding activity is present at stages of B-cell development when the « E3 ' enhancer is active .
The reason for its lack of repression at the B-cell and plasma cell stages is unclear .
Possibly at these stages the positive-acting factors that bind to the enhancer are sufficient to override the negative influence of NF-E1 .
Alternatively , two different factors might bind to the NF-E1 site : one that is an activator and one that is a repressor .
Finally , NF-E1 might act as both a repressor and an activator whose activity can be controlled posttranslationally .
At the completion of our work , we learned that NF-E1 was independently cloned by the Shenk laboratory ( and named YY-1 ) based on its ability to bind to the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter ( 34 ) .
Similar to our results , the cloned YY-1 protein can suppress the activity of a promoter linked to the YY-1 binding site .
However , YY-1 also appears to work in a positive sense because it can mediate ElA activation of the P5 promoter ( 34 , 35 ) .
Remarkably , the mouse equivalent of NF-E1 was also independently cloned by the Perry laboratory based on its ability to bind to ribosomal protein promoters ( 36 ) .
NF-6 is highly homologous ( > 98 % ) to the human NF-E1 .
Over 414 amino acids of each protein , there are only 7 amino acid differences .
NF-6 is unusual in that it binds to the ribosomal protein promoters at a location downstream of the transcriptional start site .
NF-8 is very important for ribosomal protein promoter function because mutation of its DNA binding site significantly lowers promoter activity ( 37 ) .
Therefore , NF-8 works as a transcriptional activator in the context of the ribosomal protein promoters .
Whether NF-E1 is a bifunc-tional protein and is capable of functioning as an activator in some transcriptional control elements , and a repressor in others , will require more detailed analyses .
