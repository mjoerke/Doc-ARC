Inhibition of AP-1 by the Glucocorticoid-inducible Protein GILZ* Received for publication , February 19 , 2001 , and in revised form , June 6 , 2001 Published , JBC Papers in Press , June 7 , 2001 , DOI 10.1074/jbc.M101522200 Paul R. Mittelstadt and Jonathan D. Ashwell $ From the Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology , NCI , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids arise largely by inhibition of cytokine gene expression , which has been ascribed to interference between the glucocorticoid receptor and transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF -B as well as by competition for common coactivators .
Here we show that glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of interleukin-2 mRNA expression in activated normal T cells required new protein synthesis , suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to expression of glucocorti-coid-regulated genes .
One of the most prominent glucocorticoid-induced genes is glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper ( GILZ ) , which has been reported to inhibit activation-induced up-regulation of Fas ligand ( FasL ) mRNA .
Indeed , transient expression of GILZ in Jurkat T cells blocked induction of a reporter construct driven by the FasL promoter .
This could be accounted for by GILZ-mediated inhibition of Egr-2 and Egr-3 , NFAT/AP-1-inducible transcription factors that bind a regulatory element in the FasL promoter and up-regulate FasL ex-pression .
GILZ also potently inhibited AP-l-driven and IL-2 promoter-driven reporter constructs , and recombi-nant GILZ specifically interacted with c-Fos and c-Jun in vitro and inhibited the binding of active AP-1 to its target DNA .
Whereas homodimerization of GILZ required the presence of its leucine zipper , the interaction with c-Fos and c-Jun occurred through the N-terminal 60-amino acid region of GILZ .
Thus , GILZ represents a glucocorticoid-induced gene product that can inhibit a variety of activation-induced events , at least in part by direct interference with AP-1 , and is therefore a candidate for a mediator of glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression .
Glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive agents that inhibit T cell activation and cytokine production .
They are used clinically for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory dis-eases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma , and for preventing transplant rejection .
Glucocorticoids inhibit transcriptional up-regulation of T cell-derived cytokines , such as IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-10 , and y-interferon ( 1-3 ) , and proinflammatory cytokines , such as IL-1 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stim-ulating factor , and tumor necrosis factor-a .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org glucocorticoids in T cells is Fas ligand ( FasL ) , a membrane protein that triggers apoptosis of mature T cells by engaging Fas ( 4 , 5 ) .
Inhibition of FasL-initiated apoptosis by glucocorticoids may help to stem the loss of immune cells in HIV-infected individuals ( 6 ) .
The apparent immune-enhancing effect of FasL suppression underscores the complexity of glucocorticoid biology and implies that there are numerous levels where glucocorticoid actions are controlled .
Glucocorticoids are small hydrophobic molecules that diffuse through the plasma membrane to reach the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) , which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription .
The GR contains an N-terminal hor-mone-independent activation domain , a DNA-binding domain containing a pair of zinc fingers , and a C-terminal ligand-de-pendent activation domain integrated with the ligand-binding domain ( 2 , 7 ) .
The C terminus is also the site of interaction with coactivator proteins , including SRC-1 , CBP/p300 , and PCAF ( 8-10 ) .
Ligand-bound GR is mostly monomeric in solution but homodimerizes upon cooperative binding to a GRE , a region of DNA containing two inversely symmetrical GR-binding elements ( 11 ) .
Classic GREs regulate glucocorticoid-inducible genes that play roles in metabolism and cell growth , such as those encoding metallothionein , tyrosine aminotransferase , al-anine aminotransferase , and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyki-nase ( 7 , 12 ) .
The activated GR can also suppress transcription upon binding negative GREs , whose sequences differ from the classic GRE , and are found in the genes encoding IL-1§ ( 13 ) , pro-opiomelanocortin ( 14 ) , prolactin ( 15 ) , « -subunit of glycopro-tein hormone ( 16 ) , and proliferin ( 17 ) .
GREs adjacent to other transcription factor-binding sites , such as for AP-1 , can contribute to the function of composite elements where the GR can have either positive or negative effects , depending on the cellular context and the composition of AP-1 ( 18 ) .
Increasing evidence indicates that the GR also represses gene activation without binding DNA .
This mode of repression , termed `` direct interference '' ( 19 ) , has been associated with glucocorticoid inhibition of AP-1 and NF- « B , transcription factors that contribute to the transcriptional induction of most cytokine genes .
The first reported example of direct interference was glucocorticoid repression of the AP-1 response element ( TRE ) of the collagenase gene ( 20 , 21 ) .
Both components of AP-1 , c-Fos and c-Jun , were shown to interact with the GR in the absence of any GR to DNA interaction .
Levels of AP-1 in the nucleus were not altered by glucocorticoids , and the ability of AP-1 to bind to the TRE was unaffected ( 20 , 22 ) .
When over-expressed , however , the GR could displace c-Jun from the TRE ( 21 ) , and c-Jun could displace the GR from the GRE ( 23 ) .
Consistent with the notion that the liganded GR was directly interfering with AP-1 function were the observations that repression could take place in the absence of new protein synthesis , occurred at a concentration of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( Dex ) lower than that required for transcriptional induction by the GR ( 20 ) , and could be carried out by mutant GRs whose transactivation ability was disrupted ( 20 , 296083 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 29604 CHX - -- -+ Dex _- =- ° + # o- o- ° o+ ° o+ P+I -- # - ° o+ o- + -o + ce ~ w 0 Wb w Fig .

Repression of IL-2 mRNA induction by Dex requires new protein synthesis .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with PMA ( 20 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 1 ug/ml ) in the presence or absence of 1 uM Dex and 20 nM CHX .
After 3 h , total RNA was extracted , and IL-2 mRNA was assessed by Northern blotting ( A ) .
Equivalence of loading among all samples was verified by ethidium bromide staining of the gel ( data not shown ) .
Equivalence of loading among CHX-treated and -untreated groups of samples was determined by re-probing the membrane with GAPDH cDNA ( B ) .

Direct interference by the GR with the p65 subunit of NF-kB has also been reported ( 24 ) .
The direct interference model for repression by nuclear receptors has been extended to the octamer-binding factors ( 25 ) and C/EBP ( 26 ) ( repressed by the estrogen receptor ) .
The direct interference model was further supported through the use of a C-terminal zinc finger point mutant GR whose homo-dimerization surface was dis-rupted , preventing cooperative binding to and transactivation through the classic GRE , which was able to repress AP-1 activity as a monomer ( 27 ) .
Mice whose normal GR was replaced by this mutant appeared grossly normal and had no obvious peripheral lymphoid defects , although their thymocytes did not undergo apoptosis upon treatment with Dex in vitro ( 28 ) .
In embryonic fibroblasts from these mice , Dex could block the TRE and the inflammatory mediators collagenase and gelatin-ase B , suggesting that direct interference is a major , if not the predominant , physiological mode of action of the GR .
Another transcription-independent model for repression by the GR invokes competition , or `` squelching , '' between the GR and AP-1 or NF- « B for mutual coactivators such as p300/CBP .
These coactivators possess histone acetyltransferase activity , which acts on chromatin to permit access to site-specific transcription factors .
Limiting coactivators would thus serve to direct the cellular response toward the strongest signal ( 29 ) .
Evidence supporting this model is based on studies in which overexpression of coactivators ( 30 ) or treatment with histone de-acetylase inhibitors relieves glucocorticoid repression ( 31 ) .
However , this model does not satisfactorily account , for example , for the ability of the activated retinoic acid receptor to repress AP-1 but not NF- « B ( 32 ) .
Thus , additional mechanisms would be needed to confer specificity .
To determine if the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids might be due at least in part to mechanisms other than direct interference or squelching , we asked whether the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of activation-induced up-regulation of IL-2 mRNA requires new protein synthesis .
Cycloheximide prevented the suppression , suggesting that a glucocorticoid-induced gene product might be responsible .
A recent analysis of glucocorticoid-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by cDNA gene chip array found that among the over 9,000 cDNA tested , the most highly induced gene was the DSIPI ( `` delta sleep-inducing peptide immunoreactor , '' named for its shared immunoreac-tivity with the sequence-unrelated nonamer neuropeptide Inhibition of AP-1 by GILZ DSIP ( 33 ) ) .2 DSIPI shares nearly 100 % nucleotide sequence homology with the C-terminal 75 % of human glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper ( GILZ ) ( 34 ) .
Because murine GILZ has been reported to inhibit the expression of FasL in activated T hybridoma cells , we investigated the possibility that this glucocorticoid-responsive gene might mediate the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on the expression of activation-induced genes .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cells , Reagents , and Antibodies-The Jurkat human T cell line ( ATCC ) and the murine T cell hybridoma MA 5.8 ( 85 ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 ( Biofluids Inc. , Rockville , MD ) supplemented with 4 mM glutamine , 50 uM B-mercaptoethanol , 100 units/ml penicillin , 150 ug/ml gentamicin , and 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from the NIH Blood Bank and were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with the use of lymphocyte separation medium ( Biofluids ) .
Antisera against GILZ were prepared by immunizing with the GST-GILZ fusion protein .
A rabbit was immunized with 500 ug of the GST-GILZ fusion protein mixed with complete Freund 's adjuvant and was boosted with 100 ug of GST-GILZ in incomplete Freund 's adjuvant at 2-4-week intervals .
The monoclonal antibody against TCR-¢ was obtained from Ralph Kubo ( La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology , La Jolla , CA ) ( 86 ) .
PMA , ionomycin , dexamethasone , and doxycycline were obtained from Sigma .
Plasmids-Luciferase reporters containing 511 nucleotides upstream of the FasL translation initiation site ( -511 ) or containing the Egr-binding site ( FLRE ) ( 87 ) and Egr-2- ( 88 ) and Eigr-3-driven ( 89 ) luciferase reporters have been described .
The eukaryotic expression plasmid TAM-67 , encoding a transactivation-defective c-Jun mutant , and the luciferase reporter constructs TRE-lue , driven by six copies of the proximal ( -153 ) TRE element from the murine IL-2 promoter , NFAT-luc , driven by three copies of the distal ( -287 ) NFAT/AP-1 element of the murine IL-2 promoter , and IL-2-luc , driven by 0.3 kilobase pairs of the human IL-2 promoter , have been described ( 40 ) .
c-fos and c-jun in pcDNA expression vectors were obtained from Nancy Colburn ( NCI , National Institutes of Health ) .
The GILZ cDNA was amplified from total RNA obtained from Dex-treated murine 2B4.11 hybridoma cells ( 41 ) .
Nucleotide 65 of GILZ derived from 2B4.11 cells ( T ) differed from the corresponding nucleotide in the original characterization of this gene ( C ) ( GenBank NM 010286 ) , resulting in a change in the predicted amino acid sequence from a threonine to an isoleucine .
This difference was also found in the T cell hybridoma 3DO , as well as spleen cells from C57/BL6 mice , and is consistent with the published nucleotide sequences of rat ( ABO254831 ) and human ( ABO254832 ) GILZ .
After adding a C-terminal Myc tag epitope , the cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI and Xbal sites of the expression vector pCI-neo ( Promega , Mad-ison , WI ) .
The GILZ mutant ALZ , from which leucine zipper-spanning amino acids 76-96 were removed , was generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pCI-neo .
GILZ- ( C-terminal ) Mye was transferred into the tetracycline-regulated expression vector peDNA4/TO ( Invitrogen ) .
The plasmid peDNA6 , encoding the tetracycline repressor , was obtained from Invitrogen .
Constructs encoding GST-GILZ fusion proteins were created by amplifying the GILZ cDNA and fragments 1-60 , 61-104 , 61-187 , 105-137 , and ALZ to incorporate BamHI and EcoRI sites and transferring them into pGEX-4T2 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
Transient Transfections-In transient reporter assays , 2 X 10° Jurkat cells in 0.2 ml of complete medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.4 , were electroporated with the indicated plasmids with a GenePulser ( Bio-Rad ) using 960 microfarads and 250 V. Empty parental expression plasmids were included to equalize the amount of DNA used in each cuvette .
Where indicated , cultures were stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and 1 ug/ml ionomycin .
Error bars represent the geometric error of duplicate transfections .
Experiments using the tetracycline-regulated expression system were performed using tetracycline-free fetal calf serum ( CLONTECH , Palo Alto , CA ) .
1 ug of the pecDNAA4-GILZ constructs , 0.5 ug of the repressor-encoding plasmid peDNA6 , and 2.5 ug of the luciferase reporter plasmids were used .
Doxycycline was added at a final concentration of 100 nM .
The base-line activities of the reporter plasmids were generally in the range 300 to 6000 relative light units and did not change appreciably when GILZ was coexpressed .

RESULTS Suppression of IL-2 Induction by Glucocorticoids Requires New Protein Synthesis-Transcription-independent direct interference is accepted as a major , if not the major , mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress transcription of responsive genes .
A key feature of this phenomenon is that suppression should occur in the absence of new protein synthesis ( provided that induction of the gene in question itself does not rely on factors that require de novo synthesis ) .
IL-2 plays a pivotal role in the immune response , and its transcriptional induction in T cells activated in vitro can be inhibited by Dex ( 42 , 43 ) .
Induction of IL-2 transcription largely depends on constitutively expressed transcription factors and thus does not require new protein synthesis ( 44 ) .
To determine whether glucocorticoid-mediated repression of IL-2 production requires new protein synthesis , human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were DOX +P + I Untreated P + I DOX alike - GILZ ___ _ heve Vector - TCR-C stimulated for 3 h with PMA and ionomycin in the presence or absence of Dex and/or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) , at which time IL-2 mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting ( Fig .
14 ) .
PMA/ionomycin-induced IL-2 mRNA up-regulation was inhibited by cotreatment with Dex ( compare lanes 2 and 4 ) .
Treatment with CHX did not induce expression of IL-2 message but did cause an increase in the activation-induced level ( compare lanes 2 and 6 ) .
This increase , characteristic of early-response genes whose transiently elevated mRNA levels are prolonged by blocking synthesis of presumed destabilizing proteins , has been described as `` super-induction '' ( 45 ) .
Adding CHX to Dex-stimulated cells restored the level of IL-2 mRNA to that of the CHX-superinduced cells .
Note that although CHX treatment itself caused a reduction in GAPDH , as reported previously ( 46 ) , the GAPDH levels were the same within the group cultured without CHX and within the group cultured with CHX and therefore serves as a loading control .
These data argue against a strict direct interference model , suggesting instead that in normal T cells the liganded GR induces a gene whose product inhibits transcription of IL-2 .
GILZ Prevents Activation-induced Up-regulation of FasL and Inhibits Induction of Egr-2 and Egr-3 Transcription-Because GILZ is among the most responsive of the genes up-regulated by glucocorticoids , '' we considered the possibility that it might be a general mediator of glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional repression .
Stable expression of GILZ in T cell hybridoma cells has been shown to block activation-induced up-regulation of FasL ( 34 ) .
To begin to address the mechanism by which GILZ acts , we first determined whether its inhibitory effect on FasL induction is at the transcriptional level .
GILZ cDNA was transiently expressed in Jurkat T cells together with FasL promoter-driven reporter plasmids .
When cotransfected with an empty expression plasmid , the intact FasL reporter plasmid ( bases -511 to -1 relative to the translation initiation site ) was strongly induced by treatment with PMA and ionomycin ( Fig .
24 ) .
Cotransfection of a GILZ-expressing plasmid decreased the induction in a dose-responsive manner , indicating that GILZ acts on transcription .
This region of the fasL gene contains a number of transcription factor binding sites that have been implicated in FasL regulation , including sites for Egr family members ( -214 to -207 ) , NFAT ( -276 to -272 ) , and NF-KB ( -138 to -128 ) ( 37 , 47-50 ) .
We have found that much of the activity of the FasL promoter depends upon the Egr-binding site ( termed the FLRE ) , since mutation of this element abrogated activation-induced reporter up-regulation .

was due to interference with the Egr-mediated pathway , a reporter driven by a promoter containing just the FasL FLRE ( -220 to -205 ) driving the proximal 3 ' region of the FasL promoter ( 37 ) was tested for sensitivity to the GILZ-expressing 29607 plasmid .
GILZ inhibited the Egr-2/3-dependent FLRE-driven reporter as well as it did the entire FasL promoter region ( Fig .
2B ) , indicating that GILZ exerts its effects , at least in part , by preventing the Egr-2/3-mediated pathway of FasL transcriptional induction .
Egr-2 and Egr-3 are synthesized de novo in activated T cells , and their enforced expression by transient transfection is sufficient to induce FasL reporter activity and induction of endog-enous FasL mRNA ( 37 ) .
GILZ could exert its effect on the FasL transcription by preventing their de novo synthesis of Eigr proteins , or it could block their activity at a posttranslational step , for example at the site of binding to the FasL promoter .
To distinguish between these possibilities , the GILZ expression vector was cotransfected with luciferase reporter constructs driven by the Egr-2 or the Egr-3 promoter ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
PMA and ionomycin induction of both Egr promoter-driven reporters was blocked by coexpressed GILZ .
In contrast , when transcriptional up-regulation of the FasL promoter was induced by enforced expression Egr-2 or Egr-3 alone , coexpres-sion of GILZ had no effect on reporter activity ( Fig .
3C ) .
These results indicate that GILZ does not interfere with Egr-mediated up-regulation of FasL directly but rather indirectly by preventing the transcriptional induction of Egr-2 and Egr-3 .
GILZ Blocks NFAT/AP-1 Activity-The induction of Egr-2 and Egr-3 by T cell activation is mediated by NFAT-binding elements in their promoters ( 88 , 39 ) .
To determine if the effect of GILZ on Egr-2/3 expression could be due to interference with NFAT signaling , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with an NFAT reporter with or without GILZ cDNA and activated with PMA and ionomycin .
GILZ inhibited the induction of the NFAT reporter ( Fig .
44 ) .
NFAT-binding elements are typically found adjacent to binding sites for AP-1 ( also referred to as the TRE or TPA-responsive element ) , and the affinity of each factor for its binding site is enhanced by binding of the other .
All four NFAT family members ( NFATp , -c , -2 , and -4 ) can participate in cooperative binding to the TRE-adjacent NFAT sites .
c-Jun most commonly occupies the side of the TRE nearest to NFAT ( 51 ) , although NFAT makes contacts with both c-Jun and c-Fos ( 52 ) .
In fact , as reported previously ( 40 ) , the NFAT reporter construct was also inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun ( TAM-67 ) to a similar extent as GILZ ( Fig .
4B ) , raising the possibility that GILZ in fact interferes with the AP-1 component of the NFAT-AP-1 complex .
To explore this possibility , a reporter driven by the proximal TRE of the IL-2 promoter ( 40 , 53 ) was introduced into Jurkat T cells ; its induction by PMA and ionomycin was abolished by GILZ ( Fig .
4B ) .
To characterize further the effect of GILZ on AP-1 activity , GILZ cDNA was cloned into a tetracycline ( Tet ) -regulated expression vector .
Activation of the coexpressed Tet repressor protein with the Tet analog doxycycline ( Dox ) causes its dissociation from the operator of the expression vector and allows transcription by the full-length cytomegalovirus promoter .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with the Tet-regulated GILZ expression plasmid , the repressor-encoding plasmid , and the TRE reporter plasmid .
In the presence of the empty Tet-respon-sive expression plasmid , PMA and ionomycin caused a 100-fold increase in luciferase activity , which was not affected by the addition of Dox ( Fig .
5 ) .
When the GILZ-encoding Tet-respon-sive plasmid was cotransfected , there was a small reduction in activation-induced AP-1 activity in the absence of Dox .
Adding Dox almost completely inhibited induction of AP-1 activity .
The inhibitory effect of Dox was accompanied by increased expression of GILZ protein ( Fig .
5B ) .
An irrelevant protein ( the & chain of the T cell antigen receptor ) encoded by the Tet-regulated plasmid was similarly induced by Dox in the presence of PMA and ionomycin but had no effect on the stimulation of the 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 29608 A TRE Fic .

GILZ inhibits the IL-2 promoter and the TRE reporter in the absence of dimerization .
Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter constructs driven by the TRE and the 0.4 kilobase pairs of human IL-2 promoter .
Plasmids encoding full-length GILZ , a GILZ mutant in which the leucine zipper domain was deleted ( amino acids 76-96 ) , or the empty parental plasmid were cotransfected , and activity was analyzed as above .
Results are representative of four independent experiments .
50 7 40 30 20 { 4 10 4 Fold induction 1 pCI TRE .
Taken together , these results are consistent with a model wherein GILZ inhibits the activity of AP-1 , which impairs NFAT/AP-1 signaling and leads to reduced expression of Egr-2 , Egr-3 , and FasL .
GILZ Interacts with c-Jun and c-Fos through Its N-terminal Portion-Because GILZ inhibited activation-induced AP-1 activity and contains a leucine zipper domain , the possibility was considered that GILZ might dimerize with the leucine zipper-containing AP-1 constituents c-Fos and c-Jun .
In vitro translated *°S-labeled c-Fos or c-Jun were offered to immobilized GST fusion proteins .
In vitro translated c-Jun is represented by the major lower band , with two minor upper bands that may be the products of in-frame upstream translation initiation from the polylinker region of the plasmid presumably containing c-Jun , and thus also bind GST-GILZ .
There was only a small amount of nonspecific binding of c-Jun and c-Fos to GST protein alone ( Fig .
64 ) .
In contrast , both proteins were retained by immobilized GST-GILZ .
GST-GILZ did not interact with °58-labeled NFATp or NFAT4 , two isoforms of NFAT that have been implicated in Fas ligand regulation ( 38 ) , supporting the notion that the target of GILZ is in fact AP-1 ( Fig .
6B ) .
To map the site of interaction in GILZ , fusion proteins were constructed using three non-overlapping segments of GILZ , each consisting of roughly a third of the full-length protein .
The boundaries of these segments were determined by estimating each end of the a-helical region containing the leucine zipper domain with an a-helical prediction program ( `` The PSA Protein Structure Prediction Server , '' bmere-www.bu.edu/psa/ ) .
Surprisingly , both c-Fos and c-Jun were efficiently retained by the N-terminal portion of GILZ- ( 1-60 ) , which lacks the leucine zipper ( Fig .
6A ) .
Neither c-Fos nor c-Jun bound the C-terminal third ( residues 105-137 ) or two-thirds ( residues 61-137 ) of the molecule .
GST- ( 61-137 ) retained the ability to dimerize with translated GILZ via the leucine zipper , arguing that the distal two-thirds of the molecule was properly folded ( data not shown ) .
As expected , given the lack of a requirement for the GILZ leucine zipper to bind c-Fos and c-Jun , the AP-1 components did not bind the isolated central domain of GILZ that contains the leucine zipper ( residues 61-104 ) .
It is possible that the GILZ leucine zipper is in fact nonfunc-tional .
One way to test this is to determine if GILZ can form leucine zipper-dependent homodimers .
*°S-Labeled GILZ was incubated with GILZ fusion proteins .
As shown in Fig .
6C , GILZ bound to GST-GILZ .
Deleting GILZ residues 76-96 , Inhibition of AP-1 by GILZ IL-2 80 60 4 40 20 1 .
GILZ - ALZ pCI _ GILZ - ALZ which constitute three turns of the leucine zipper , abrogated the interaction .
GILZ also bound to the related product of the transforming growth factor-B-induced gene TSC-22 immobilized by fusion to GST in a leucine zipper-dependent fashion ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the leucine zipper of GILZ may be selective for a particular subclass of leucine zippers .
The effect of GILZ on the interaction of AP-1 with its target DNA was tested in an electromobility supershift assay .
As shown in Fig .
6D , extracts of a PMA-stimulated T cell hybridoma bound DNA containing a consensus AP-1-binding site .
The shifted band was effectively competed for by unlabeled cognate AP-1-binding sequence ( AP-1 oligonucleotides ) but not an NF- « B-binding sequence ( NF-kB oligonucleotides ) .
Further-more , anti-Fos antibody but not a control antibody ( anti-Egr-2 ) reduced the amount of bound AP-1 .
Incubation of the extracts with GST-GILZ but not an equimolar amount of GST greatly reduced the intensity of the shifted band , indicating that , at least under these conditions , GILZ interferes with the binding of active AP-1 to its cognate DNA .
Taken together , these data support a model in which a GILZ homodimer interacts with AP-1 components and prevents binding to DNA .
The Leucine Zipper Motif of GILZ Is Not Required for Transcriptional Inhibition-The initial observation in this study was that repression of IL-2 by Dex depended on new protein synthesis ( Fig .
1 ) .
To determine whether GILZ could serve as such an induced protein , the ability of GILZ to block activity of the IL-2 promoter was tested .
GILZ blocked the PMA- and ionomycin-induced up-regulation of the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
7A ) .
Because the leucine zipper of GILZ did not directly participate in direct binding to c-Fos or c-Jun , its role in the repressive function of GILZ was examined .
The GILZ mutant lacking the leucine zipper domain was nearly as effective as wild type GILZ at inhibiting both the TRE ( Fig .
7A ) and the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
7B ) .
This indicates that the repressive activity of GILZ resides outside of the leucine zipper .
Further-more , because a leucine zipper-bound partner protein is not required for GILZ to exhibit inhibitory activity , it is likely that GILZ can function as a monomer .
DISCUSSION Glucocorticoids influence metabolic and functional activities in almost all cell types .
As such a versatile molecule it is likely to have diverse modes of action .
Although the GR possesses strong transcriptional activity , its suppressive effects , in par 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Inhibition of AP-1 by GILZ ticular those mediated by passively obstructing other transcription factors , have recently received a great deal of atten-tion .
In this study we report that in addition to their ability to promote direct interactions between the GR and target transcription factors , glucocorticoid suppression of normal T cell cytokine production may also depend on a contribution from GR-mediated transactivation , leading to transcription of a gene whose product can itself carry out direct interference .
Direct interference between the GR and transcriptional ac-tivators has been implicated in glucocorticoid repression of inflammatory mediators such as collagenase ( for AP-1 ) and IL-6 ( for NF-kB ) ( 24 , 32 ) , which can be produced by non-lym-phoid cells .
A similar mechanism was invoked to account for glucocorticoid repression of IL-2 in T cells , based on the observation that occupancy of a GR lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain was able to inhibit the IL-2 promoter ( 54 ) .
However , the study of the IL-2 promoter was performed with Jurkat T cells , in which some signaling pathways are aberrant , for example the lack of the phosphatase PTEN and the resulting constitutive activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 55 ) .
In fact , we have found that activation-induced up-regulation of IL-2 mRNA in Jurkat T cells is blocked by cycloheximide , '' suggesting that regulation of the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat cells , unlike normal resting T cells , depends on newly synthesized proteins .
In addition , an N-terminal deletion mutant GR , similar to that used by Northrop et al .
( 54 ) has been reported to transactivate a GRE in a Dex-dependent manner in yeast ( 56 ) .
Interestingly , when a GR mutant in the C-terminal zinc finger that was defective in transactivation and yet capable of mediating suppression ( 20 ) , another transactivation-defective mutant , and the dimerization-deficient mutant GR were stably expressed in SAOS2 osteosarcoma cells , treatment with Dex caused growth-arrest and induction of one or both of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 '' and p27 '' to a degree similar to that of the wild type GR ( 56 ) .
These observations are consistent with the possibility that a Dex-induced gene product could participate in blocking transcriptional induction of the IL-2 promoter .
Among the genes reported to be induced by glucocorticoids , the requirement for a newly synthesized protein to block IL-2 induction appeared to be best satisfied by GILZ , whose leucine zipper is characteristic of transcriptional regulators and whose expression is limited to lymphoid cells ( 384 ) .
Expression of GILZ inhibited activation-induced up-regulation of the FasL promoter , as well as the promoters of two transcription factors involved in FasL regulation , Egr-2 and Egr-3 .
Up-regulation of Egr-2 and Egr-3 requires the participation of NFAT , and indeed a critical NFAT site has been identified in the promoters of each gene ( 38 , 39 ) .
With rare exceptions , NFAT elements are composite elements that contain an AP-1-binding site and are thus more accurately termed NFAT/AP-1 elements ( 51 ) .
In fact , GILZ potently inhibited gene expression driven by an AP-1-responsive element .
The activity of the intact IL-2 promoter depends on the proximal TRE ( 57 ) , thus accounting for the increased inhibition of the IL-2 promoter over that of the NFAT/AP-1 element .
The observation that the GILZ leucine zipper does not interact with c-Fos or c-Jun but is capable of mediating homodimerization implies that GILZ can form a homodimer in vivo .
However , the near-wild type repressive activity of a GILZ mutant lacking the leucine zipper suggests that GILZ can function as a monomer .
The leucine zipper could also enable dimerization with other partners , such as the closely related protein TSC-22 , which also has a leucine zipper and can bind GILZ in vitro .
° P. R. Mittelstadt and J. D. Ashwell , unpublished observations .
29609 TSC-22 was identified on the basis of the up-regulation of its mRNA by transforming growth factor- , can also be induced by Dex , and exhibited transcriptional repressive activity when tethered to a promoter through fusion to the DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 protein ( 58 ) .
Although homologous to and capable of heterodimerization with GILZ , TSC-22 appears to have distinct biological activities .
For example , we have found that in Jurkat cells TSC-22 behaved as a transcriptional acti-vator , causing a 3- to 5-fold increase in the PMA and ionomy-cin-stimulated activity of the IL-2 reporter when transiently expressed ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it is possible that these two leucine zipper-containing proteins can modify each other 's behavior when concomitantly expressed .
Interestingly , in a study using microarray analysis to identify developmentally regulated genes in B cells , GILZ was found to be expressed in resting B cells from a mouse transgenic for a HEL-specific antigen receptor and was down-regulated when the cells were activated with antigen ( 59 ) .
Other genes encoding known transcriptional repressors , such as Id3 , LKLF , and BKLF , were also down-regulated in the activated B cells , consistent with the view that GILZ may act as a transcriptional repressor in vivo and indicative of a role for GILZ outside of T cells .
In any case , the results presented in this report indicate that in addition to possibly causing direct interference through the GR , in T cells glucocorticoids induce at least one molecule ( GILZ ) that itself can bind to and interfere with AP-1 .
