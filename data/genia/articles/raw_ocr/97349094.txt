genes following t ( 1 ; 19 ) chromosomal translocations in B cell precursor acute leukemias .
Experimentally B cell progenitors do not tolerate constitutive expression of E2a-Pbx1 which contrasts with transformation of several other cell types following its stable expression both in vitro and in vivo .
To further investigate the effects of E2a-Pbx1 on the B cell progenitors , we conditionally expressed E2Za-Pbx1 under control of a metal response element in hematopoietic precursor cell lines in vitro .
Inducible expression of E2a-Pbx1 resulted in cell death with the morphologic and molecular features of apoptosis .
A structure-function analysis demonstrated that induction of apoptosis was not a dominant-negative effect of the EZ2a moiety but , rather , required the DNA-binding homeodomain of Pbx1 .
E2a-Pbx1-induced apoptosis proceeded through a BCL2-responsive checkpoint eventuating in PARP inactivation but did require p53 .
Constitutive expression of E2a-Pbx1 did not induce apoptosis or continued cycling of Rat-1 fibroblasts in low serum conditions .
These studies demonstrate that E2a-Pbx1 initiates programmed cell death of hematopoietic precursers by a mechanism that requires its chimeric transcriptional properties , but , unlike other nuclear oncoproteins , is independent of pS3 .
Keywords : apoptosis ; inducible oncoprotein ; transloca-tion ; homeodomain Introduction Chromosomal translocations constitute an important mechanism by which cellular proto-oncogenes are converted to oncogenes in human cancers .
Several chromosomal translocations in leukemias lead to production of fusion proteins with features of chimeric transcription factors ( Cleary , 1991 ) .
The first of these was reported in pre B cell acute leukemias , where the t ( 1 ; 19 ) translocation results in expression of chimeric oncoprotein EZ2a-Pbx1 ( Kamps et al. , 1990 ; Nourse et al. , 1990 ) .
One of the genes involved in this translocation , E2A , codes for two alternatively spliced transcription factors , E12 and E47 , which regulate developmental pathways in muscle , pancreatic and B cells ( Kadesch , 1992 ) .
The other gene , PBX1 , codes for a highly conserved member of a small subfamily of divergent homedomain-containing proteins with unique Correspondence : KS Smith Received 24 October 1996 ; revised 11 December 1996 ; accepted 16 December 1996 genetic and biochemical properties ( Monica et al. , 1991 ) .
The Drosophila homolog of Pbx1 , exd , has been shown genetically to act in parallel with Hox proteins in the determination of segmental identity ( Rauskolb et al. , 1993 ) .
A similar role for Pbx proteins is suggested by their potential involvement in a highly conserved autoregulatory loop that controls HoxBI1 expression in the mouse hindbrain ( Popper !
et al. , 1995 ) .
Recent biochemical studies support a role for Pbx/exd proteins as DNA-binding cofactors for Hox proteins ( reviewed in Mann and Chan , 1996 ) and suggest that the binding activities of Pbx-Hox complexes contribute to the position-specific activities of Hox genes ( Chang et al. , 1996 ) .
The transcriptional properties of Pbx1 are altered following fusion with EZ2a due to the acquisition of two transcriptional activation domains located within the E2a moiety ( Aronheim et al. , 1993 ; Quong et al. , 1993 ) .
E2a-Pbx1 is a potent activator , whereas Pbx1 is a non-activator , of synthetic reporter genes containing Pbx/ Hox consensus binding sites ( Lebrun and Cleary , 1994 ; Lu et al. , 1994 ; Van Dijk et al. , 1993 ) .
Due to loss of the E2a basic DNA-binding region but retention of the Pbx homeodomain , the EZ2a-Pbx1 chimera displays DNA-binding properties identical to those of wild type Pbx proteins and in this capacity binds DNA cooperatively with class I Hox proteins ( Chang et al. , 1995 , 1996 ; Lu et al. , 1995 ; Phelan et al. , 1995 ) .
These features support an hypothesis that the oncogenic properties of EZa-Pbx1 result from subversion of target genes whose expression is normally regulated by wild type Pbx proteins in the context of their role as cofactors for Hox and non-Hox homeodomain proteins .
E2Za-Pbx1 displays oncogenic activity in several different cell types despite its restricted association with a subset of human leukemias .
Fibroblasts , myeloblasts and lymphoblasts have all been shown experimentally to undergo neoplastic change in response to forced expression of EZa-Pbx1 ( Dedera et al. , 1993 ; Kamps et al. , 1991 , 1993 , 1996 ; Monica et al. , 1994 ) .
However , B cell precursors , the cell type involved in human t ( 1 ; 19 ) leukemias , are curiously resistant to experimental transformation .
In fact , precursor B cells in vitro do not tolerate stable expression of EZa-Pbx1 ( unpublished observations ) .
In vivo , expression of an EZa-Pbx1 transgene in the lymphoid compartment of transgenic mice resulted in profound hypoplasias , in contrast to the hyperplasias seen with other oncogenes expressed under similar conditions .
In spite of this , E2a-Pbx1 mice developed T lineage , but not B lineage , lymphoblastic lymphomas although thymuses were noted to contain markedly increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis .
These observations suggested that EZa-Pbx1 may modulate Apoptsosis induced in vitro by EZa-Pbx1 KS Smith et al 2918 cell survival and that its oncogenic properties may depend on the relative resistance of various cell types of apoptosis .
Apoptosis , or programmed cell death , is a genetically controlled process ( Ellis et al. , 1991 ) that is frequently subject to failure in neoplastic cells .
This has been most dramatically illustrated by studies of Bel-2 and related family members ( reviewed in Nunez and Clarke , 1994 ) which function as repressors or inducers of programmed cell death .
The inter-relationships of growth control and apoptotic pathways are further demonstrated by studies showing that tumor suppressor protein p53 induces programmed cell death following DNA damage by ionizing radiation ( Kastan et al. , 1991 ) or certain genotoxic chemicals ( Lowe et al. , 1993 ) .
The role of p53 in apoptosis is independent of its ability to potentiate cell cycle arrest through induction of p21 ( Wagner et al. , 1994 ) .
Recent reports show a functional role for p53 in oncogene-mediated apoptosis ( Harrington et al. , 1994 ) .
Overexpression of the proto-oncogene c-myc has been shown to modulate apoptotic cell death in rat fibroblasts under low serum conditions or drug-induced cell cycle arrest ( Evan et al. , 1992 ) .
Myc-induced apoptosis is dependent on p53 induction ( Hermeking and Eick , 1994 ) and may represent a cell-suicide response to inappropriate cell cycle progression .
Likewise the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A induces cell cycle advancement and concomitant p53-mediated apoptosis in primary rodent cells but co-expressed EIB inhibits p53 with resultant suppression of apoptosis ( Debbas and White , 1993 ) .
In this report we show that conditional expression of the nuclear oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 induces apoptosis in hematopoietic precursor cell lines in vitro .
A structure-function analysis demonstrated that induction of apoptosis by EZa-Pbx1 requires its function as a chimeric transcription factor .
EZ2a-Pbx1-induced apoptosis proceeds through a BCL2-responsive checkpoint and eventuates in PARP inactivation but does not involve alterations of several other known mediators of apoptosis including p53 .
Furthermore , unlike mye , EZa-Pbx1l does not induce apoptosis or continued cycling activity of Rat-l fibroblasts in low serum conditions .
These data demonstrate that EZa-Pbx1 initiates programmed cell death in hematopoietic cells but it does so by a mechanism different from other nuclear oncoproteins that is not dependent on p53 .
Results Conditional expression of E2a-Pbx1 under control of a metal response element in the Reh B-cell precursor cell line To obtain conditional expression of EZa-Pbx1 in B cell precursors , the EZa-Pbx splice variant 1b was cloned into the metal response element vector MRE-pNEO and the resulting construct ( MRE-E2A-PBX1b ) ( Figure la ) was transfected by electroporation into Reh cells .
Stably transfected Reh cells were selected in G-418 and single cell clones were isolated by FACS sorting or limiting dilution .
Cells ( MT1 ) containing the empty MRE-pNEO vector were also selected and used as negative controls in all subsequent experiments .

( a ) Schematic illustration of the MRE-E2A-PBX1b construct used for stable transfection of the B-cell precursor cell line Reh .
( b ) Time course of EZa-Pbxlb induction .
Reh pre-B cell clones stably transfected with MRE-E2A-PBX1b ( A2 ) or MRE vector without insert ( MTI ) were treated with 100 um ZnSO , for the times listed above the gel lanes .
Cell lysates were examined by Western blot to determine the kinetics of EZa-Pbxlb induction .
EZa-Pbxlb was detected using an anti-E2a monoclonal antibody ( Jacobs et al. , 1993 ) which also recognizes the endogenous , wild type EZa proteins whose migrations are indicated to the right Transfected Reh clones were screened for levels of EZa-Pbxlb expression in the absence or presence of ZnSO , .
Several clones exhibited induced levels of EZa-Pbxlb equal to or greater than endogenous EZa proteins E12/E47 as detected by Western blot analysis .
The results obtained from a representative clone ( A2 ) are shown in Figure 1b .
Following zinc exposure , EZa-Pbxlb was rapidly induced in the A2 clone as evidenced by its detection as early as 2 h post-treatment ( data not shown ) .
Maximal protein expression was observed between 8-12 h post induction ( Figure 1b ) and these levels were maintained at all subsequent time points out to 60 h. Prior to induction , no EZa-Pbxlb was detected in A2 cells by sensitive Western blot analysis indicating minimal if any leakiness of the inducible MRE construct .
The antibody employed for Western blot analysis also reacted with endogenous wild type EZa proteins whose levels remained relatively constant in both the MTI and A2 clones throughout the induction period .
E2a-Pbx1b induces apoptosis of Reh cells To assess the effects of enforced EZ2a-Pbx1b expression on precursor B cells , the MTI and A2 clones of Reh were treated with two different concentrations of ZnSO , ( 25 or 100 um ) for 72 h. At specific time points post-induction , cell numbers and viabilities were scored by microscopic assessment of morphologic features characteristic of apoptosis ( cytoplasmic blebbing and nuclear condensation ) .
Prior to ZnSO , induction , over 95 % of A2 cells were viable , but by 24 h post-induction with 100 uM ZnSQO , , A2 viability dropped to 80 % and continued to decrease to approximately 20 % survival by 72 h ( Figure 2a ) .
In contrast , treatment of the A2 clone with 25 uM ZnSO , did not appreciably alter overall cell survival from pretreatment levels demonstrating a dosage dependent response of A2 to zinc treatment .
Neither concentration of ZnSO , induced cell death in the MT 1 control cells whose survival was maintained at greater than 90 % throughout the 72 h treatment period .
The response of A2 cells to different concentrations of ZnSO , was directly related to the induced levels of E2a-Pbx1lb protein expression as assessed by Western % Cell Surv Time ( h ) b MTI A2 25 100 25 100 - uM ZnSO , % - E2a-Pbx1b cae - $ - wit E2A c d MTI A2 * G AC « < « Cb a AC sie ) AC # Figure 2 Induction of apoptosis by E2a-Pbx1b in Reh cells .

The MTI and A2 clones were treated with 100 um ZnSO , for 36 h and chromosomal DNA was isolated and examined by ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis .

Cells displaying morphologic features of apoptosis ( AC ) are indicated Apoptsosis induced in vitro by EZa-Pbx1 KS Smith et al blot analysis .
Considerably lower levels of EZ2a-Pbx1b were detected at 25 uM compared to the robust expression at 100 uM ( Figure 2b ) .
Neither concentration had an appreciable effect on expression of endogenous EZa proteins in the MTl and A2 clones .
Cell death induced by EZa-Pbxlib demonstrated molecular and morphologic features characteristic of apoptosis .
Ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA isolated 36 h post-induction with zinc showed oligonucleosomal DNA degradation in A2 but not MTI cells ( Figure 2¢ ) .
Bright field microscopy of A2 cells showed numerous cells with condensed chromatin , severe vacuolization and membrane blebbing characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis in vitro ( Figure 2d ) .
Induction of apoptosis by EZa-Pbx1 requires its function as a transcription factor Previous studies have demonstrated that EZa-Pbx1 contains several domains that are necessary for its transcriptional and oncogenic properties ( Chang et al. , 1996 ; Monica et al. , 1994 ) .
To assess which portions of E2a-Pbx1 are required for induction of apoptosis , we performed a structure/function analysis that utilized several mutant forms of EZa-Pbx1 whose expression was regulated by the MRE in stably transfected Reh cells .
The various constructs employed for these studies contained deletions in the Pbx portion of the chimeric protein as shown schematically in Figure 3a .
We also assessed the properties of EZ2a-Pbx1la , an isomer which differs at its carboxy terminus due to differential splicing ( Nourse et al. , 1990 ) .
Furthermore , to assess the specific contribution of the Pbx moiety versus other DNA-binding motifs , we tested the apoptotic potential of EZ2a-HIf , another leukemia-associated EZa chimera that contains a basic region and leucine zipper fused to E2a in place of the homeodomain protein Pbx1 found in E2a-Pbx1 ( Hunger et al. , 1992 ; Inaba et al. , 1994 ) .
Reh clones harboring the various mutant EZa-Pbx1 constructs and were tested for expression of the mutated proteins prior to and following zinc induction .
Individual clones capable of inducing appropriately sized proteins at levels equal to or greater than endogenous EZa proteins by Western blot analysis ( Figure 3b ) were employed for further studies .
The apoptotic potentials of the various E2a chimeras were determined by morphologic assessments of cell survival after 72 h of induction with 100 uM ZnSO , ( Figure 3a ) .
Both isomers ( a and b ) of EZ2a-Pbx1 were capable of inducing apoptosis under these conditions although EZa-Pbxlb was slightly more potent than E2a-Pbxla .
A mutant ( APbx1 ) lacking all Pbx-derived sequences and consisting solely of the EZ2a portion of the chimera was incapable of inducing apoptosis indicating a need for specific motifs from Pbx1 .
The required Pbx sequences appeared to consist of more than its homeodomain since a mutant ( HD » ; - » ) containing the Pbx homeodomain fused directly to EZa was incapable of inducing apoptosis .
However , inclusion of 12 additional amino acids flanking the carboxy end of the homeodomain ( construct HD » » -s1 , ) restored apopototic properties to the chimera ( 50 % of EZa-Pbxlb activity ) .
These data define a minimal portion of Pbx1 that is functionally competent for induction of apoptosis and are consistent with previous 2919 Apoptsosis induced in vitro by EZa-Pbx1 KS Smith et al 2920 studies of ours showing that the comparable portions of Pbx are required for cooperative DNA-binding in vitro with Hox proteins ( Chang et al. , 1995 ) .
The required sequences flanking the Pbx homeodomain have been proposed to mediate heterologous interactions with Hox proteins ( Chang et al. , 1996 ) .
Two additional constructs ( 1IbAHD and A232-430 ) coding for mutants that lack the Pbx homeodomain were incapable of inducing apoptosis providing further evidence that the EZa-Pbx1 chimera needs to bind DNA through its homeodomain to induce apoptosis under these experimental conditions .
A mutant ( A299 308 ) with partial deletion of the Hox cooperativity motif ( Chang et al. , 1997 ) was severely compromised in its apoptotic properties but still able to adversely affect viability ( 45 % of EZa-Pbxlb activity ) .
No apoptosis was observed following induction of EZa-HIf expression suggesting that specific recognition of Pbx but not HIf targets renders Reh cells susceptible to apoptosis .
Effects of EZ2a-Pbx1 on known modulators of apoptosis To investigate potential mechanisms by which EZ2a-Pbx1 induces apoptosis , we assessed the expression a Relative spoptomy actmity ( # ) g m « 0 oo so 10 Pol- 1 4 cn fmt = P D gel 1 f n T -V ” 7 “ tamed ~ ~O % M© ] 2so30e C -- , 0840 tewo - C227 39 O ma » `` O } | omnrne - ® rors ___ 2 L. w Cmc tram : - _ MT !

Deleted regions of mutant constructs are depicted by blanks .
Also shown is the chimeric bZIP protein EZa-HIf .
Cross-hatched boxes denote the Pbx1 homeodomain or Hif bZIP motifs .
Results of apoptosis assays for each construct are expressed as a percentage of apoptotic activity relative to intact E2Za-Pbx1b .
The percentage of surviving cells was assessed over 72 h following addition of ZnSO , ( 100 um final concentration ) to the culture media .
Viable cell numbers at each time point were determined by light microscopic assessment of morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis .
Each value represents the mean of triplicate samplings from duplicate experiments .
( b ) Clonal populations of Reh cells stably transfected with intact or mutant E2a-Pbx1 constructs under control of an MRE were induced with 100 um ZnSO , for 12 h and cell lysates from each were used for Western blot analysis using an anti-E2a monoclonal antibody .
The M ; of each was assessed using prestained protein standards patterns of various proteins known to be modulators of apoptosis using Western blot analysis following 100 uM zinc induction of A2 and MTI cells .
Immunodetection of Bcel-2 , a known repressor of programmed cell death , showed that its levels decreased in A2 but not MT1 cells ( Figure 4 ) , however this decrease occurred late after 48 h of induction suggesting that it was not a primary cause of apoptosis in A2 cells We also assessed the expression levels of Bcel-2 superfamily members Mcl-1 , a repressor of cell death , and Bax , a death promoter , by Western blot using immune sera specific for these proteins .
Both were unaffected over the 60 h period during which A2 cells were undergoing EZa-Pbxl-induced apoptosis ( Figure 4 ) .
We also quantitated the levels of tumor suppressor gene product p53 given its previously reported role in programmed cell death induced by nuclear oncoproteins adenovirus Ela and Myc ( Debbas and White , 1993 ; Hermeking and Eick , 1994 ) .
The levels of p53 protein were found to increase dramatically in A2 cells undergoing EZa-Pbxl-induced apoptosis , however , a comparable increase of p53 was observed in MTl cells ( Figure 4 ) which lack EZa-Pbx1 and do not undergo apoptosis suggesting that p53 levels were responding to the zinc treatment alone although no apparent effects on the cycling activity of MTI cells were observed ( data not shown ) .
Finally , we determined whether PARP expression and composition were affected by induction of apoptosis by EZa-Pbxlb .
PARP has been shown to play a role as a distal downstream mediator in 0 12 24 36 48 60 Hr Post-Induction MT ] « =- cam » cam cme coms came .

Cells from Reh clones MTI and A2 were exposed to ZnSO , for time periods indicated above the gel lanes .
Aliquots were examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for various modulators or effectors of apoptosis as indicated to the right of the panels .
Immunological reagents for the detection of Bcl-2 , Bax , Mcl-1 , p53 and PARP are described in Materials and methods .
The total cellular protein loaded per gel lane was equalized based on determinations , .
Molecular weights were calculated based on co-electrophoresis of standard size apoptosis , namely inactivation of PARP by proteolytic cleavage precedes chromatin degradation ( Kaufmann et al. , 1993 ) .
Using an anti-PARP monoclonal antibody we observed cleavage of PARP from a native molecular weight of 116 kD to 85 kD over the 60 h timecourse ( Figure 4 ) .
In A2 cells , PARP cleavage was first detected at 36 h post-induction with almost complete cleavage to the 85 kD form by 60 h. In contrast , the levels and size of PARP remained essentially unaltered in control MTI cells following identical treatment with zinc .
These data indicate that apoptosis induced by EZa-Pbx1 traverse a molecular pathway involving activation of a CED-3/ICE family protease which responds by proteolytically cleaving PARP .
Bel-2 protects against EZa-PbxI-induced apoptosis Given the known role of Bcel-2 in modulating the survival of progenitor B cells , the delayed reduction in Bcl-2 levels following enforced expression of EZa-Pbx1 in Reh cells suggested that Bcl-2 loss may partially contribute to the observed cell death .
To further investigate the effects of Bcel-2 on EZ2a-Pbxl-induced apoptosis , Bel-2 was constitutively expressed at high levels under control of the CMV promoter in MTl and A2 cells .
The resulting MTI-BCL2 and A2-BCL2 cells were then treated with zinc and assessed for apoptosis .

( a ) The Reh clones MTI and A2 were stably transfected with a construct that constitutively expresses BCL2 under control of the CMV promoter .
Cell lysates were analysed by Western blot using an anti-BLC-2 monoclonal antibody .
( b ) The resulting clones ( MTI-BCL2 and A2-BCL2 ) were exposed to 100 um ZnSQ4 over the course of 72 h. Apoptotic cells were quantitated by morphological assessments of cell viability and values are the average of triplicate determinations Apoptsosis induced in vitro by EZa-Pbx1 KS Smith et al death induced by E2a-Pbx1 , displaying 80 % survival at 72 h post-induction compared to 20 % survival of A2 cells ( Figure 5 ) .
MTI-BCL2 cells showed slightly enhanced survival compared to MTI in the presence of zinc .
Thus , although A2 cells express detectable levels of endogenous Bcl-2 , hyperexpression of exogenous Bcl-2 confers enhanced survival following enforced expression of EZa-Pbx1 perhaps by further neutralizing Bax , which is also expressed in Reh cells ( Figure 4 ) .
Our studies indicate that the apoptotic signals initiated by EZa-Pbx1 proceed through a checkpoint that is responsive to Bcl-2 and suggest a mechanism by which lymphoid cells expressing EZa-Pbx1 following chromosomal translocations may escape its apoptotic properties and contribute to leukemic development .
E2a-Pbx1-induced apoptosis does not require p53 An essential role has been demonstrated for p53 in mediating apoptosis induced by nuclear oncoproteins Myc and EIA .
Our studies described above of apoptosis induced by EZa-Pbx1 in the A2 clone of Reh cells showed that p53 expression is markedly increased following EZ2a-Pbx1 expression , but a similar increase in p53 protein levels was observed in MTI cells which do not express EZa-Pbx1 , therefore a specific role for p53 could not be established .
To further investigate a possible role for p53 , we assessed the ability of EZa-Pbx1 to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells which lack functional p53 ( Wolf and Rotter , 1985 ) .
HL60 cells were stably transfected with MRE or MRE-EZA-PBX1b constructs , cloned and then used in quantitative apoptosis assays .
Following induction of EZa-Pbxlb expression , survival of HL60-E2A-PBX1 cells decreased to approximately 40 % at 72 h compared to greater than 90 % survival for HL60 HL GO-MRL C & o € A pA & « 0 g LBO 2a Por lt ro ~ mag ZEZJ-F ’ L ‘ ﬂb + re wt E2a o 74 a8 Time ( h ) Figure 6 Induction of apoptosis by EZa-Pbx1 in p53-null HL60 cells .

The percentage of surviving HL60-EZa-Pbx1 and control HL60-MRE cells were determined by morphologic assessments of cell viability .

Inset shows inducible expression of EZa-Pbxlb in HL60 cells .
HL60-E2a-Pbx1b cells stably transfected with MRE-E2A-PBX1B were incubated in the presence of 100 um ZnSO , for 36 h. Total cell extracts were prepared and analysed by Western blot using an anti-EZa 2921 Apoptsosis induced in vitro by EZa-Pbx1 KS Smith et al 2922 MRE cells ( Figure 6 ) .
These data show that myeloid precursor cells as well as cells of the lymphoid lineage are susceptible to the apoptotic effects of EZ2a-Pbx1 and that p53 is not required for apoptosis to occur under these experimental conditions .
Constitutive expression of EZ2a-Pbx1 does not induce apoptosis or continued cycling of Rat-1 fibroblasts Since several nuclear oncoproteins render cells susceptible to apoptosis ( e.g .
ElA , Myc and E2F ) by inducing cell cycle progression ( Debbas and White , 1993 ; Hermeking and Eick , 1994 ; Shan and Lee , 1994 ) , we investigated whether EZa-Pbx1 may share similar properties .
These studies were conducted in Rat-l fibroblasts since Reh cells did not tolerate arrest and concurrent treatment with ZnSO , Rat-l1 fibroblasts , unlike Reh , support constitutive expression of EZa-Pbx1 without undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 7 ) .
Stably transfected , cloned Rat-1 cells expressing EZa-Pbx1 , c-myc , or containing vector alone were grown to logarithmic phase and transferred to 0.1 % FCS .
The c-myc-expressing cells began undergoing apoptosis within hours of serum starvation .
In contrast , Rat-1/ E2a-Pbx1 showed only background levels of apoptosis comparable to the control cells ( data not shown ) .
After serum starvation for 72 h , Rat-l/mye and Rat-1/E2a-Pbx1 cells were analysed for total DNA content by FACS .
Rat-l/myc cells remained in cycle ( 17.8 % S phase cells ) similar to Rat-l/vector cells growing in 10 % FCS ( 21.2 % S phase ) .
In contrast , Rat-1/E2a-Pbx1 and Rat-l/vector cells in 0.1 % FCS showed considerably smaller S phase fractions ( 5.4 % and 8.7 % , respectively ) consistent with growth arrest ( Figure 7a ) .
Apoptosis of Rat-l/mye cells was evident by the large fraction containing sub-G1 DNA content .
The percentage of cells actively traversing S phase was quantitated by metabolic labeling with 100 uM BrdU ( Table 1 ) .
Rat-l/mye cells incubated in 0.1 % serum displayed an S phase fraction ( 30.0 % ) comparable to Rat-1/vector cells in 10 % serum ( 28.6 % ) .
By comparison , Rat-1/E2a-Pbx1 and Rat-l1/vector cells incubated in 0.1 % serum displayed S phase fractions of 13.9 % and 8.6 % , respectively .
Therefore , under low-serum conditions in which constitutive mye expression induces cell cycling and concomitant apoptosis of Rat-l fibroblasts , no comparable effects are evident from forced expression of EZa-Pbx1 .
These data provide additional evidence that the oncoproteins EZa-Pbx1 and c-myc differ in the mechanisms by which they render cells susceptible to apoptosis .
Discussion In this report we show that chimeric oncoprotein EZa-Pbx1 induces apoptosis of hematopoietic precursor cell lines in vitro and provide evidence that it initiates this process by a mechanism that differs from other nuclear oncoproteins .
To demonstrate these phenomena , we employed a conditional expression system because previous attempts to constitutively express EZa-Pbx1 in lymphoid cell lines were unsuccessful .
The levels of induced EZa-Pbx1 expression achieved in our experiments approximated steady-state levels of wild type EZa proteins in B lineage precursor cell lines .

Clone # 1 displayed high level constitutive expression of EZa-Pbx1b and was employed for DNA content studies Table 1 Cell cycle analysis of Rat-1 clones Cell lines Percent of cells in S phase FACS BrdU 10 % 0.1 % 10 % 0.1 % Rat-1/myc nd 17.8 nd 28.6 Rat-1/E2a-Pbx1 nd 5.4 nd 13.9 Rat-1/vector 21.2 8.7 30.0 8.6 levels are also comparable to those of EZa-Pbx1 proteins expressed under control of the E2A promoter in t ( l ; 19 ) -bearing leukemia cells Therefore , the observed effects on cell survival are a biologic property of EZa-Pbx1 at intracellular concentrations characteristic of human disease states and not simply a consequence of massive experimental over-expression .
These studies extend previous work on E2A-PBX1 transgenic mice which initially suggested that EZa-Pbx1 was capable of rendering thymocytes susceptible to apoptosis ( Dedera et al. , 1993 ) .
Increased numbers of apoptotic cells were measured in thymuses of these mice .
Profound lymphopenias of both T and B cells were observed prior to development of lymphoblastic malignancies , however the cellular basis for these effects were not established .
Our current studies suggest that the observed lymphopenias in transgenic animals were a direct result of adverse effects in vivo by EZa-Pbx1l on the survival of lymphoid progenitors comparable to those we found in vitro .
We conclude that EZ2a-Pbx1 has the capability to modulate both the survival and neoplastic properties of lymphoid progenitors .
Mutational analyses indicated that EZa-Pbx1 requires its activity as a transcription factor to promote apoptosis .
Deletion of all Pbx-derived sequences from E2a-Pbx1 eliminated its apoptotic activity indicating that cell death was not induced by possible dominant-negative effects of EZa lacking its carboxy-terminal bHLH DNA-binding and dimerization motifs .
This possibility was raised by previous observations that the amino-terminal portion of EZa lacking its bHLH motifs has growth inhibitory properties in fibroblasts ( Peverali et al. , 1994 ) , however our studies exclude this as the basis for EZ2a-Pbx1l-induced apoptosis .
Rather , apoptosis resulted from expression of chimeric proteins containing N-terminal E2a fused to specific portions of Pbx1 .
The minimal portion of Pbx1l required for apoptosis consisted of its homeodomain and 12 flanking amino acids .
The latter constitute a conserved motif ( named the Hox cooperativity motif or HCM ) that also serves important roles for the transcriptional and transforming activities of EZa-Pbx1 ( Chang et al. , 1997 ) .
As summarized in Table 2 , there is consistent absence of biological or transcriptional activity for minimal construct HD ; ; ; _ ; ; , which lacks the HCM , in contrast to the activity of HD » » » , which contains both the Pbx1 homeodomain and HCM .
Based on mutational studies and molecular modeling ( Chang et al. , 1996 ) , the HCM is predicted to serve as a site of contact for heterologous DNA-binding partners such Table 2 Comparative biological and transcriptional properties of E2a chimeric proteins DNA- Trans- Trans-Construct binding “ activation '' formation “ Apoptosis E2a-Pbxla + + + + E2a-Pbx1b + + + + A299-308 + '' + '' - + 1bAHD - - + A232-430 - - - HD232-310 + + + + HD232-298 - - - APbx1 - - - E2a-HIf + + + *These data are summarized from previous reports ( Chang et al. , 1995 , 1997 ; Hunger et al. , 1992 ; Inaba et al. , 1994 ; Monica et al. , 1994 ) .
DNA-binding and transcriptional activation for Pbx chimeras were assessed on a PBX consensus site ( Lebrun and Cleary , 1994 ) and for E2a-HIf on an HLF consensus site ( Hunger et a/. , 1992 ) .
`` The DNA-binding and transcriptional properties of this construct vary depending on the binding site employed ( Chang et al. , 1997 ) Apoptsosis induced in vitro by EZa-Pbx1 KS Smith et al as class I Hox proteins .
Given the requirement for the HCM , we conclude that E2a-Pbx1 must function as a transcriptional protein recognizing subordinate targets in the context of heterologous DNA-binding partners to effect apoptosis .
However , there are distinct differences in the structural requirements for apoptosis versus transformation that provide additional insights into potential mechanisms that may underlie these biological properties of EZa-Pbxl .
For instance , construct 1bAHD , lacking the Pbx1 homeodomain , was incapable of inducing apoptosis in contrast to its ability to transform fibroblasts .
We have recently shown that the homeodomain-independent transforming properties of E2a-Pbx1 are critically dependent on the Pbx HCM ( Chang et al. , 1997 ) .
Based on the findings that subtle alterations of the Pbx HCM resulted in complete abrogation of transforming activity whereas the homeodomain was entirely dispensible , we concluded that heterologous protein-protein interactions mediated by the HCM are more important for transformation by EZa-Pbx1 than interactions with cognate Pbx DNA sites .
However , a similar conclusion does not apply to E2a-Pbx1l-induced apoptosis where Pbx-DNA interactions appear to be essential based on the inability of 1bAHD to induce apoptosis .
These disparate findings are likely to reflect the requirement for different DNA-binding partners to interact with EZ2a-Pbx1 to recognize subordinate target genes involved in apoptosis versus transformation .
This suggestion is supported by results from construct A299-308 , containing a subtotal deletion of the HCM , which retains partial apoptotic potential but lacks transforming activity .
In transcriptional and DNA-binding assays , A299-308 shows variable activity dependent on which Hox proteins are provided as DNA-binding partners ( Table 2 and Chang et al. , 1997 ) .
These differences may be attributable to the variable structural requirements of different partners for HCM interactions which are unmasked by subtotal disruption of the HCM by the A299-308 deletion .
A specific role for the Pbx moiety of EZa-Pbx1 in potentiating apoptosis is further demonstrated by the inability of EZ2a-HIf to render Reh cells susceptible to apoptosis .
EZa-HIf , like EZa-Pbx1 , is a chimeric transcriptional protein resulting from chromosomal translocations in B cell precursor leukemias , however EZa-HIf contains a basic DNA-binding region and leucine zipper dimerization motif in contrast to the homeodomain contained by EZa-Pbx1 .
As a conse-quence , EZa-HIf binds and activates transcription through DNA sites different from those recognized by EZ2a-Pbx1 or wild type E2a proteins ( Hunger et al. , 1994 ; Inaba et al. , 1994 ) .
Recent studies have shown that forced expression of EZ2a-HIf prevents precursor B cells of the BaF3 cell line from undergoing apoptosis in response to IL3 withdrawal ( Inaba et al. , 1996 ) .
These findings raise the possibility that HIf targets may equate with survival whereas Pbx targets may equate with apoptosis .
However , we have not observed enhanced survival of lymphoid precursors expressing E2a-HIf in vitro or in EZ2a-HIf transgenic mice ( Smith and Cleary , unpublished observation ) suggesting that there are cell-type specific differences in responses to chimeric HIf as well as Pbx proteins .
In the case of Pbx , this may in part reflect the spectrum of 2923 Apoptsosis induced in vitro by EZa-Pbx1 KS Smith et al 2924 endogenously expressed Hox proteins displaying different sequence specificities as cooperative DNA-binding complexes with E2a-Pbx1 .
The large repertoire of Hox proteins would allow for a range of potential functional outcomes .
Our studies show that EZa-Pbx1-induced apoptosis proceeds ultimately through a Bel-2-regulated checkpoint and eventuates in PARP inactivation .
These results strongly implicate the activation of a protease belonging to the CED3/ICE family of serine proteases , a group shown to contain several diverse members functionally able to cleave PARP whose proteolysis is a marker of apoptosis initiated by several stimuli ( Lippke et al. , 1996 ; Schlegel et al. , 1996 ; Tewari et al. , 1995 ) .
We obtained no evidence that EZa-Pbxl-associated apoptosis was due to primary perturbations of this checkpoint due to alterations in the level of proteins such as Bcel-2 , Mcl-1 or Bax , although down-regulation of Bel-2 may be a late effect .
Thus , the molecular events between transcriptional induction of EZa-Pbx1 subordinate genes and protease activation remain unknown .
Potential genes that are regulated in part by contributions from Pbx-like proteins have been identified through genetic analyses in Drosophila .
The Drosophila homologue of Pbx1 , extradenticle ( exd ) , functions in parallel with homeotic selector genes abdominal A ( abd-A ) , antennapedia ( Antp ) , and ultrabithorax ( Ubx ) ( Rauskolb et al. , 1993 ) in regulating downstream genes essential in determining body segment identity ( Rauskolb and Wieschaus , 1994 ) .
Subordinate genes include wingless and deca-pentaplegic ( dpp ) , which code for signaling molecules of the Wat and TGFR families , respectively .
Furthermore the human homologue of dpp was identified as bone morphogenetic factor 4 ( BMP-4 ) a signaling molecule shown to be required for interdigital apoptosis within the developing chick limb ( Zou and Niswander , 1996 ) .
Pbx has also been implicated as a cofactor with the non-Hox homeodomain protein STF-1 in the regulation of somatostatin gene expression ( Peers et al. , 1995 ) .
These data are consistent with possible signaling molecules or cytokines as products of primary targets misregulated by EZa-Pbx1 in lymphoid precursors .
We are currently investigating the potential role of TGFR family members and FAS ligand which are implicated in modulating lymphocyte survival in other settings .
Additional findings further suggest that the mechanism by which EZa-Pbx1 renders cells susceptible to apoptosis may be fundamentally different than those employed by other nuclear oncoproteins .
Most sig-nificantly , EZa-Pbxl-induced apoptosis displays no requirement for tumor suppressor protein p53 .
Although p53 levels increased following zinc treatment of Reh cells , comparable increases were observed regardless of whether the cells expressed EZa-Pbx1 .
However , Reh cells were shown to be responsive to p53-mediated apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation ( Smith and Cleary , unpublished observation ) .
Apoptosis was also observed in HL-60 myeloid progenitor cells which do not express functional p53 protein .
The lack of p53 requirement differs from apoptosis associated with forced expression of c-myc or adenoviral ElA proteins , whose effects on cell cycle progression generate signals that pass through a p53 checkpoint to eventuate in cell death ( Debbas and White , 1993 ; Hermeking and Eick , 1994 ) .
By comparison , EZa-Pbxl1 _ induced apoptosis of hematolymphoid cells under normal growth conditions and did not obviously perturb the cycling activity of Reh cells ( Smith and Cleary , unpublished observation ) .
Furthermore , constitutive expression of EZa-Pbx1 was incapable of sustaining continued cycling of Rat-l1 cells under low serum conditions in which c-myc-expressing Rat-l1 cells remained in cycle and underwent apoptosis .
Taken together , these results suggest that the apoptotic process initiated by E2a-Pbx1 does not breach a p53 checkpoint and is unlikely to involve a reflexive response to primary abnormalities of cell cycle control .
Our findings are consistent with the reported very low incidence of p53 mutations in t ( 1l ; 19 ) -bearing human leukemias at diagnosis ( Kawamura et al. , 1995 ) .
The ability of EZa-Pbxl to render lymphoid progenitors highly susceptible to apoptosis would appear to be inconsistent with its potential role in the leukemic transformation of the same cell type .
However , our studies provide a plausible mechanism by which cells expressing EZa-Pbx1 may escape its apoptotic effects .
Given that elevated levels of BCL2 suppress EZa-Pbx1-induced apoptosis in Reh cells , pre-B cells that have acquired t ( 1 ; 19 ) translocations may be similarly protected by endogenously high levels of death suppressors ( such as BCL2 or functionally analogous family members ) relative to death accelerators such as BAX .
Most t ( 1 ; 19 ) leukemias display maturation arrest at the pre-B cell stage of differentiation with expression of cytoplasmic but not surface Ig mu chains .
Pre-B cells typically express IL7 receptors and are exquisitely responsive to this cytokine which has potent survival effects .
Therefore , concurrent physiologic survival signals may play an important role in - EZa-Pbxl-associated leukemogenesis and potentially account for the association of the t ( 1 ; 19 ) with a characteristic subset of human pediatric leukemias .
The potential ability of synergistic interaction of Bcl-2 and E2a-Pbx1 to alter the growth of cells is currently being investigated in transgenic animal models .
The availability of in vitro or animal models of pre-B cell transformation by EZa-Pbx1 as well as the identification of bona fide target genes would significantly enhance efforts to dissect the apoptotic and oncogenic signaling cascades initiated by this chimeric transcription factor .
Materials and methods Expression constructs and stable transfections The full-length EZ2a-Pbxla and EZa-Pbxlb cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI site of MRE-pNEO .
The E2A-PBX1 mutant HD ; » - ; 1 , was made by partially digesting the E2a-Pbx1b cDNA with PvuII eliminating the region 3 ' of the fourth Pvull site and inserting a stop codon by PCR .
The E2a-Pbx1 mutants A232-430 was reported previously as A621-819 ( Monica et al. , 1994 ) .
A homeodomain deletion mutant of E2a-Pbxlb ( 1IbAHD ) was constructed by replacing the carboxy terminus of EZa-Pbxla homeodomain mutant A621-683 ( Monica et al. , 1994 ) with the carboxy terminal Neo !
fragment of Pbx1b .
The construct was produced by using PCR to add a stop codon immediately downstream from the homeodomain of the previously reported mutant A477-620/708-819 ( Monica et al. , 1994 ) .
All mutant E2a-Pbx1 cDNAs and the E2a-HIf cDNA ( Hunger et a/. , 1992 ) were cloned into the BamHI site of MRE-pNEO by blunt-end ligation .
E2a-Pbx1b and c-mye were blunt-end ligated into the EcoRI site of the retroviral vector COS-MSV/NEO which was used to prepare retroviral stocks employed for infection of Rat-l fibroblasts .
COS-MSV/NEO-E2a-Pbx1b or -comyc were transiently transfected into the ectropic helper lines BOSC using the calcium phosphate technique .
Viral supernatants were collected and added to logarithmically growing Rat-1 fibroblasts .
Stable clones were selected in 500 ug/ml G418 sulfate and individual clones were isolated .
Reh cells were electroporated at a concentration of 4 x 10 '' cells/ml using 20 ug linearized plasmid DNA .
Cells were washed once in serum-free RPMI and incubated at room temperature in RPMI for 10 min prior to electroporation which was performed using a BioRad Gene Pulser with capacitance extender ( Hercules , CA ) at 400 V and 960 uFD at room temperature .
Following electroporation , cells were incubated at room temperature in RPMI for 10 min then cultured for 48 h in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS ( R-10 ) .
Stable transfectants were then selected in medium containing 500 ug/ml G418-sulfate for 2 weeks at which point single cell clones were isolated by either FACS sorting or limiting dilution into 96 well plates .
Stable cell clones were maintained in R-10 containing 200 ug/ml G418-sulfate .
Expression and immunoblotting of protein Stably transfected Reh clones were induced with zinc sulfate at a final concentration of 100 uM in R-10 .
Induced cells were collected at specified timepoints , washed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , lysed immediately in 1x sample buffer ( 50 mm Tris-Cl ( pH 6.8 ) , 10 % glycerol , 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) ) and boiled for 5 min .
The lysates were sonicated and the OD ; ; , was determined .
Ten micrograms of total cellular protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-E2a monoclonal antibody as previously described ( Jacobs et al. , 1993 ) .
The homeodomain lacking construct ( 1bAHD ) was detected using a Pbxlb-specific monoclonal antibody ( Y ) and MLC , unpublished ) .
Western blot analyses to assess various modulators of apoptosis were performed under similar conditions employing a rabbit antiserum specific for Bax ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , an anti-Bel-2 monoclonal antibody ( Dako Corp. ) , anti-Mcl-1 antisera ( Dr John Reed , LaJolla Cancer Research Institute ) , an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody ( PharMingen ) , and anti-PARP monoclonal antibody ( Dr Guy Poirier , Centre Hospital , University Laval ) .
Rat-1 fibroblasts were collected using cell scraping buffer ( 150 mm NaCl , 40 mm Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 1 mM EDTA ) and lysed as described above .
Western blot detection of EZa-Pbxlb production within Rat-l fibroblasts was accomplished using an anti-E2a monoclonal antibody .
