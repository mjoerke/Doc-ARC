7 and Arthur Weiss** '' IL-2 gene transcription in T cells requires both TCR and costimulatory signals .
IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells stimulated with superantigen presented by Raji B cells requires CD28 activation .
The addition of rCTLA4Ig , which blocks CD28 binding to its ligand , to the cultures decreased IL-2 promoter activation by > 80 % .
Interestingly , CTLA4Ig did not significantly inhibit the activation of either NF of activated T cells ( NFAT ) or AP-1 reporters .
Therefore , activation of NFAT and AP-1 is insufficient for IL-2 promoter activation .
In contrast , an RE/AP reporter was blocked by CTLA4Ig by > 90 % .
Thus , the requirement for CD28 in IL-2 promoter activation appears to be due to RE/AP and not the NFAT or AP-1 sites .
In addition , these data suggest that transcriptional activation of RE/AP is not mediated by NFAT , because activation of a NFAT reporter is not affected by the addition of CTLA4Ig .

Minimally , two signals are required to convert resting T cells into effector cells : one signal through the TCR in response to appropriate Ag bound to a MHC molecule , and a second `` costimulatory '' signal ( 1 ) .
TCR activation alone may result in a state of unresponsiveness or anergy ( 2 ) .
CD28 , a 44-kDa glycoprotein expressed as a homodimer on most T cells , can mediate the costimulatory signal , and its stimulation can prevent anergy ( 3 ) .
In vivo , CD28 binds to one of its ligands , B7-1 and B7-2 , on the surface of APC ( 4 ) .
A CD28-related molecule , CTLA-4 , can also bind to B7-1 and B7-2 , but with a higher affinity than CD28 ( 4 ) .

E-mail address : aweiss @ itsa.ucsf.edu Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists an Ig fusion protein , CTLA4Ig , can effectively block CD28-mediated signaling by preventing association of CD28 with its ligands ( 3 ) .
One important consequence of T cell stimulation is the production of cytokines , including IL-2 , due to both transcriptional up-regulation and stabilization of the mRNA ( 5 ) .
T cell activation induces the association of NF of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , '' AP-1 , and NF- « B family members to sites within the IL-2 promoter ( reviewed in Refs .
6 and 7 ) .
Mutagenesis studies from this laboratory have previously revealed that a CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) located within the IL-2 promoter is necessary for CD28-mediated transcriptional activation ( 8 ) .
However , we and others recently showed that CD28 responsiveness within the IL-2 promoter is actually conferred by a composite element ( `` RE/AP '' ) containing both the CD28RE and adjacent NF-IL-2B AP-1 site ( 0-11 ) .
The CD28RE is a poor consensus NF-kB binding site , which has been shown to associate with NF- « B family members , primarily c-Rel ( 11-13 ) .
However , it has also been reported that NFAT and not NF- « B family members binds to the CD28RE ( 14 ) .
If NFAT and AP-1 mediate transcriptional activation of the RE/AP site within the IL-2 promoter , then it would be expected that RE/AP should be activated under conditions where both NFAT and AP-1 are up-regulated .
It has been previously shown that activation of the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells in response to superantigen requires both TCR and CD28 signals ( 15 ) .
Here , we show that NFAT and AP-1 activation occurs in Jurkat T cells in response to superantigen independent of CD28 signaling .
In contrast , the activation of RE/AP , like the intact IL-2 promoter , is abrogated when CD28 engagement is blocked .
Therefore , transcriptional regulation of RE/AP is not mediated by NFAT/AP-1 family members , because RE/AP activation does not occur when both NFAT and AP-1 are up-regulated .
In addition , our findings suggest that activation of both NFAT and AP-1 is insufficient to induce IL-2 promoter transcription .

Transfections and luciferase assays Jurkat transfections and all luciferase assays were performed as previously described ( 11 ) .
Transfections into human PBLs were performed as described ( 18 ) , except that 25 pug of either RE/AP or NFAT luciferase reporter were used .
Briefly , PBLs were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll gradient ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) and washed several times .
PBLs were seeded at 5 X 10° cells/ml and stimulated with 1 pg/ml PHA ( Abbott Laboratories , Chicago , IL ) before transfection .
Cells were washed and re-suspended at 2 X 10 '' cells/ml .
A total of 0.25 ml cells and 25 ug DNA were electroporated in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette at 250 V , 960 pF , using a Bio-Rad gene pulser ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
Stimulations Jurkat cells were stimulated 20-28 h after transfection with Raji/SED as previously described ( 15 ) .
FK506 was used at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml and was added to the Jurkat cells just before the addition of Raji/ SED .
CTLAA4Ig or control Ab MOPC195 was used at a final concentration of 10 ug/ml and added to Raji cells 30 min before the addition of Jurkat cells and SED .
Then , 16 h after stimulation by Raji/SED , the cells were harvested for luciferase assays .
Stimulations of Jurkat cells by €305 , PMA , and 9.3 were performed as previously described ( 11 ) .

The data described are the result of three independent transfections .
All p values were determined by student 's £ test .
Cell staining Jurkat cells were stimulated as above .
After stimulation , the cultures were stained using anti-human CD69-FITC and anti-human CDS-phycoerythrin ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
Jurkat , but not Raji , cells expressed CD5 .
Cells were gated for expression of CD5 and examined for expression of CD69 using a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Cell staining was performed as recommended by the manufacturer .
Results and Discussion IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells in response to superantigen requires both stimulation through the TCR as well as CD28 costimulation ( 15 ) .
Jurkat T cells can be activated to secrete IL-2 by the superantigen SED presented by the B cell line Raji ( 8 , 19 ) .
We wanted to determine the requirements for IL-2 promoter transcription in response to superantigen by examining the activation of various reporter constructs containing transcriptional elements involved in IL-2 promoter activation , NFAT , AP-1 , and RE/AP , and their responses in the presence or absence of CD28 costimulation .
Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters containing either the IL-2 promoter or multimerized copies of RE/AP , NFAT , or AP-1 , and were stimulated with Raji cells , SED , or a combination of both .
Incubation with either Raji or SED alone was insufficient for activation of any of the reporter constructs ( Fig .
14 ) .
However , activation of all four reporters was induced by the combination of this APC and SED .
Additionally , the combination of Raji and SED induced expression of the cell surface activation Ag CD69 on Jurkat cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
Use of a different superantigen , SEE , produced similar effects ( data not shown ) .
To determine the contribution of CD28 to the up-regulation of each of these reporters during this T cell-APC interaction , Raji cells were preincubated with CTLA4Ig before the addition of SED and Jurkat cells to the cultures .
CTLA4Ig recognizes the same ligands as CD28 , B7-1 and B7-2 , but with higher affinity , thereby CUTTING EDGE sooB s S co & im 0 Relative Luciferase Activity ha I © o 0 P 1 R = Ral - + -+ +O -+ -+ -+ -+ SP -- 4+4 , < -- t+4 -- t+4 -- ++ Luc Reporter : RE/AP NFAT AP-1 IL-2 B 120 150 Counts o 5 } 6D M ait 0 agl dg ocr _ a '' CD69-FITC FIGURE 1 .
Both Raji cells and SED are required for activation of various transcriptional reporters and CD69 .
A , Jurkat T cells were transfected with either RE/AP , NFAT , AP-1 , or IL-2 promoter luciferase reporters .
Approximately 20-28 h later , the cells were left unstimulated or stimulated by incubation with Raji B cells and/or superantigen SED .
For each re-porter , the relative luciferase activity was standardized to the luciferase counts when stimulated with both Raji cells and SED ( =100 ) .
The stimulated luciferase activity of each construct is not equal .
The actual average luciferase counts for the Raji/SED stimulation of RE/AP is 21,961 , for NFAT is 34,879 , AP-1 is 42,003 , and for IL-2 9,967 .
The results shown are the average of three independent experiments .

blocking their association with and subsequent activation of CD28 ( 3 ) .
As shown in Fig .
24 , CTLA4Ig inhibited the activation of the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat cells stimulated with Raji/SED by > 80 % .
Similarly , CTLA4Ig also inhibited activation of the RE/AP composite element by > 90 % .
No significant effect of CTLA4Ig was observed on either the NFAT or AP-1 reporters ( Fig .
24 ) or on the induction of the activation Ag €D69 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , CTLA4Ig did not globally disrupt activation of Jurkat T cells by Raji/SED .
Identical amounts of an irrelevant mAb had no effect on the induction of any reporter or CD69 ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) .
Therefore , CD28 signaling is critical for the activation of the IL-2 promoter in response to superantigen and APC .
Because activation of NFAT and AP-1 was unaffected by the blockade of CD28 , it does not appear that these elements are responsible for the defect in IL-2 promoter transcription produced by the block of the CD28-B7 interaction by CTLA4Ig .
Moreover , these data show that activation of NFAT and AP-1 is insufficient to activate the IL-2 promoter .
However , activation of the RE/AP composite element is dependent on CD28 signaling .

1g '' conclude that RE/AP is the critical element within the IL-2 promoter that is activated by CD28 and is required for activation of the IL-2 gene by superantigen .
In addition , because RE/AP activation was blocked by CTLA4Ig even though NFAT and AP-1 reporters were unaffected , it does not appear that activation of RE/AP is mediated by NFAT/AP-1 as had been previously proposed ( 14 ) .
Rather , these data are consistent with the findings that RE/AP activation is mediated by c-Rel and AP-1 ( 10 , 11 ) .
Consistent with a major role for RE/AP activation in IL-2 promoter regulation , the c-Rel knockout mouse is defective in IL-2 production in response to CD3/CD28 stimulation ( 20 ) .
The findings that RE/AP and NFAT differ in their requirement for CD28 activation were confirmed by transfecting normal human PBLs .
As previously reported ( 15 ) , the transcriptional response of PBLs stimulated by a pool of three staphylococcal enterotoxins presented by Raji cells can be monitored with reporter constructs .
Stimulation with enterotoxins presented by Raji B cells activated RE/AP and NFAT reporter constructs by 22- and 23-fold , respec-tively .
RE/AP activation in PBLs stimulated by enterotoxins presented by Raji cells was inhibited by almost two-thirds by the addition of CTLA4Ig to the culture ( 62.0 + 1.3 % ) .
Significantly less inhibition of the NFAT reporter response was observed when CTLA4lg was added ( 30.5 + 3.3 % ; p < 0.01 ) .

control Ab did not affect either RE/AP or NFAT activation ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , these findings with normal PBLs support our data obtained with Jurkat cells ; RE/AP is not a NFAT site , and it is the major site of CD28 activation in the IL-2 promoter .
We should note that the inhibition of RE/AP by CTLA4Ig was not as complete in normal PBLs as was observed in Jurkat cells .
This may relate to the prestimulation that must be used to render the PBL s transfectable with the DNA reporter constructs .
They must be prestimulated for 20 h with mitogenic concentrations ( 1 ug/ml ) of PHA before transfection .
This may alter the requirements for costimulation after transfection .
Consistent with this , the background luciferase activity of RE/AP in PBLs is considerably higher than in Jurkat cells ( ~6400 in PBLs compared with ~400 in Jurkat cells ) .
Also , there may be additional costimulatory molecules present and activated on PBLs as compared with Jurkat cells .
However , the data obtained with PBLs is consistent with the data in Jurkat cells that RE/AP is different from NFAT and is the major site of CD28 costimulation in the IL-2 promoter .
Activation of RE/AP in response to superantigen required CD28 signaling ( Fig .
24 ) .
Our previous data suggested that RE/AP was a site of signal integration in T cells ; any pairwise combination of either TCR , CD28 , or PMA can be used to activate RE/AP-depen-dent transcription ( 11 ) .
TCR-mediated activation of RE/AP is sensitive to inhibition by the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 , while CD28-mediated activation of RE/AP is resistence to FK506 ( 11 ) .
To determine whether RE/AP also integrates signals through the TCR in a physiological response to superantigen , FK506 was used in the Raji/SED system .
As shown in Fig .
3A , FK506 blocked 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 6458 activation of RE/AP , NFAT , and the IL-2 promoter in response to Raji/SED almost completely ( > 95 % inhibition ) .
However , activation of AP-1 and the expression of CD69 remained intact ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) , indicating that although activation of the IL-2 promoter has been inhibited , Jurkat cell activation in response to superantigen has not been globally interrupted .
Therefore , in a response to a physiological stimulus , SED superantigen presented by Raji B cells , the activation of RE/AP minimally requires two signals : one through the TCR as demonstrated by inhibition by FK506 and the second through CD28 as demonstrated by inhibition by CTLA4Ig .
It is interesting that CTLA4Ig specifically interrupted only CD28 signals , presumably leaving other adhesive and costimulatory interactions between the Jurkat T and Raji B lymphoblastoid cells during Ag presentation intact , including LFA-1/ICAM , LFA-2/ LFA-3 , etc .
However , it does not appear that these molecules on the surface of Jurkat T cells can compensate for the loss of CD28 signaling .
These findings are consistent with studies that demonstrated a central role for CD28 stimulation in IL-2 production ( 21 , 22 ) .
However , these data do not preclude the notion that other costimulatory pathways ( not present or activated between Raji B cells and Jurkat T cells ) exist that can substitute for CD28 engagement for RE/AP and IL-2 promoter activation .
Alternate mechanisms for activation of RE/AP are currently under investigation .
