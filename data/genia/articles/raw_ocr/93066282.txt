Sherwood Lawrence , June 17 , 1992 ( received for review December 9 , 1991 ) ABSTRACT Corticosteroids are the preeminent antiinflammatory agents although the molecular mechanisms that impart their efficacy have not been defined .
The endothelium plays a critical role in inflammation by directing circulating leukocytes into extravascular tissues by expressing adhesive molecules for leukocytes [ e.g. , endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 ( ELAM-1 ) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) ] .
We therefore determined whether corticosteroids suppress inflammation by inhibiting endothelial expression of adhesion molecules for neutrophils ( polymorphonuciear leuko-cytes ) .
Preincubation of endothelial cells with endotoxin [ lipo-polysaccharide ( LPS ) , 1 pg/ml ) led to a 4-fold increase in subsequent adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( P < 0.0001 , z = 10 ) to endothelial cells , an increase that was markedly attenuated when endothelial cells were treated with dexamethasone ( ICs , < 1 nM , P < 0.0001 , n = 6 or 7 ) during preincubation with LPS .
Moreover , the steroid receptor agonist cortisol ( 10 LM ) , but not its inactive metabolite tetrahydrocortisol ( 10 M ) , diminished LPS-induced endothelial cell adhesiveness .
Further evidence that the action of dexamethasone was mediated through ligation of corticosteroid receptors { human glucocorticoid receptors ( hGRs ) ] was provided by experiments utilizing the steroid antagonist RU-486 .
RU-486 ( 10 4M ) , which prevents translocation of ligated hGR to the nucleus by inhibiting dissociation of hGR from heat shock protein 90 , completely aborted the effect of dexamethasone on adhesiveness of endothelial cells ( P < 0.0005 , » = 3 ) .
Treatment of endothelial cells with LPS ( 1 pg/ml ! )
stimulated transcription of ELAM-1 , as shown by Northern blot analysis , and expression of membrane-associated ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 , as shown by quantitative immunofluorescence ( both P < 0.001 , r = 9 ) .
Dexamethasone markedly inhibited LPS-stimulated accumulation of mRNA for ELAM-1 and expression of ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 ( ICs , < 10 nM , both P ?
< 0.001 , » = 4-9 ) ; inhibition of expression by dexamethasone was reversed by RU-486 ( both P < 0.005 , n = 4-6 ) .
As in the adhesion studies , cortisol but not tetrahydrocortisol inhibited expression of EL AM-1 and ICAM-1 ( both P < 0.005 , r = 3 or 4 ) .
In contrast , sodium salicylate ( 1 mM ) inhibited neither adhesion nor expression of these adhesion molecules .
These studies suggest that antagonism by dexamethasone of endotoxin-induced inflammation is a specific instance of the general biological principle that the glucocorticoid receptor is a hormone-dependent regulator of transcription .
Although glucocorticoids are among the most potent and widely used antiinflammatory agents , the mechanisms by which they reduce inflammation are unknown .

potheses have been proposed ; these include ' '' 'allosteric '' effects on enzymes ( 1 ) , redirection of lymphocyte traffic ( 2 ) , direct inhibition of various phospholipases ( 3 ) , induction of such proteins as lipocortin ( 4 ) , inhibition of the transcription of various cytokines and metalloproteases ( 5-14 ) , and our own earlier suggestion that glucocorticoids stabilize lysoso-mal and other cellular membranes ( 15 , 16 ) .
However , none of these hypotheses is sufficient to account for the well-known pharmacologic effects of glucocorticoids in humans : leuko-cytosis ( 17 ) , inhibition of leukocyte recruitment to inflamed areas ( 18 , 19 ) , retention of lymphocytes in the lymphatic circulation with shrinkage of peripheral lymph nodes , and the promotion of microbial infection ( 2 ) .
Recent studies have suggested that endothelial cells can direct the traffic of leukocytes into inflamed and infected areas ( heterotypic adhesion ) via the regulated expression of surface adhesive molecules [ e.g. , GMP140 , endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 ( ELAM-1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) ( 20-23 ) ] .
In a complementary fashion , leukocytes also express proteins [ CD11a-c/CD18 , L-selec-tin , or lectin/epidermal growth factor cell adhesion molecule 1 ( LECAM-1 ) ] on their surface that mediate their specific localization to sites of inflammation ( 24 , 25 ) .
Agents that modulate the interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium may , therefore , possess potent antiinflammatory properties .
We now present data compatible with the hypothesis that glucocorticoids-at nanomolar concentrations-inhibit the expression of adhesive molecules ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 by endotoxin-activated endothelial cells and thereby interfere with the traffic of leukocytes into inflamed areas .
Pretreatment of endothelial cells with corticosteroids prevents endothelial cells from becoming more adhesive for neutrophils [ polymor-phonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) ] and diminishes stimulated expression of ICAM-1 and ELAM-1 , molecules critical for neutrophil adhesion .
Moreover , these data make it likely that corticosteroids regulate ELAM-1 at the transcriptional level .

RESULTS Glucocorticoids Prevent Adhesion of PMNs to LPS-Stimulated Endothelial Cells ( Heterotypic Adhesion ) .
Activation of HUVECs with LPS or cytokines [ interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) ] causes endothelial cells to bind unstimulated PMNs more avidly ( 20 , 21 , 30 , 32 ) .
When we treated HUVECs with LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) we found , as expected , that ~4-fold more PMNs adhered to treated than untreated HUVECs ( 50 + 3 vs. 13 + 2 PMNs per high-power field , P < 0.0001 ) .
Dexamethasone inhibited PMN adhesion to the LPS-stimulated HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner ( ICsp < 1 nM , P < 0.005 , Fig .
1 ) .
Glucocorticoid Receptors Mediate the Effects of Glucocorticoids on Adhesion of PMNs to HUVECs .
To determine whether the modulation of endothelial adhesiveness by dexamethasone was receptor-mediated we studied the effects of RU-486 , a noncompetitive antagonist of glucocorticoid receptors ( 33 , 34 ) .
RU-486 ( 10 uM ) completely reversed the effect of dexamethasone on LPS-stimulated adhesiveness of HUVECs ( Fig .
1 , P < 0.0005 ) .
In other experiments 100-fold higher concentrations of the less potent steroid receptor agonist cortisol ( IC , = 100 nM , n = 2 ) , but not its inactive metabolite tetrahydrocortisol ( 0.1 and 10 mM ) , diminished the LPS-stimulated increment in adhesiveness ( data not shown ) .
Further , neither indomethacin ( 10 M ) nor sodium salicylate ( 1 mM ) affected the LPS-stimulated increment in endothelial adhesiveness .
Glucocorticoids Modulate Expression of ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 on LPS-Stimulated Endothelium .
We next determined whether the effect of corticosteroids on endothelial cell adhesiveness resulted from diminished expression of ELAM-1 or ICAM-1 .
After stimulation by LPS , HUVECs increased expression of ELAM-1 by 321 % + 68 % ( SEM , P < 0.0001 , n = 16 ) and ICAM-1 by 250 % + 38 % ( P < 0.0001 , n = 16 , Fig .

In the absence of dexamethasone RU-486 did not affect adhesion of PMNs to either unstimulated ( 122 % + 16 % of control , n = 4 ) or LPS-treated endothelium ( 114 % + 11 % of control , n = 4 ) .

Glucocorticoids Prevent Accumulation of Message for ELAM-1 in Response to LPS and IL-1a But Not in Response to TNF .
To further define the mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit up-regulation of adhesive molecules , we studied the effect of dexamethasone ( 0.1 uM ) on the level of mRNA for ELAM-1 in HUVECs .
Treatment of HUVECs with LPS , IL-la ( 20 units/ml ) , and TNF ( 50 units/ml ) stimulated a marked increase in detectable message for ELAM-1 in HUVECs ( Fig .
5 ) .
Dexamethasone ( 0.1 uM ) did not affect basal levels of mRNA for EL AM-1 but markedly inhibited the LPS-and IL-1a-stimulated increase in message .
In contrast , dexamethasone did not affect the TNF-stimulated increment in detectable ELAM-1 message , an observation that suggests that glucocorticoids do not directly affect stability of message for ELAM-1 .
Although these findings need to be fortified by further studies of the effects of glucocorticoids on the stability of ELAM-1 message and the rate of transcription of ELAM-1 by stimulated endothelium , the results suggest that glucocorticoids act at the transcriptional level .
Dexamethasone Does Not Reverse the Effect of TNF-a on Endothelial Adhesiveness for PMNs .
Since dexamethasone did not affect the level of message for ELAM-1 in TNF-a-stimulated HUVECs , we sought to determine whether this was reflected in the adhesiveness of TNF-a-treated endothelium for PMNs .

rendered the endothelium more adhesive to PMNs ( 23 % + 1 % adherence vs. 9 % + 2 % adherence , n = 4 , P < 0.01 ) and dexamethasone did not diminish the increased adhesiveness of TNF-stimulated endothelium for PMNs ( 21 % + 1 % adherence , n = 4 ) .
DISCUSSION We show here that one important mechanism by which glucocorticoids may affect the inflammatory response is modulation of the capacity of the endothelium to respond to an inflammatory stimulus .
Glucocorticoids , acting at their cytoplasmic receptors , diminish the LPS-stimulated increase in endothelial adhesiveness for resting PMNs and diminish transcription and expression of pro-inflammatory adhesive molecules on the surface of the endothelium .
Since recent studies have increasingly pointed to the central role of the endothelium in directing the traffic of leukocytes into inflamed areas , our observations bear directly on the mechanism for the antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids .
Moreover , our results help to explain the dramatic leukocy-tosis observed in patients taking therapeutic doses of corticosteroids [ concentrations similar to those studied here ( 17 ) ] .
RU-486 stabilizes the association of steroid receptors with heat shock protein 90 in the presence of ligand , which prevents translocation of glucocorticoid receptors to the nucleus and thereby blocks transcription of genes containing glucocorticoid-responsive elements ( 33 , 35-40 ) .
Our demonstration that RU-486 reverses the effects of dexamethasone on the adhesive qualities of HUVECs and the expression of adhesive molecules on their surface is therefore most consistent with the Proc .

Dexamethasone inhibits the stimulated increase in mRNA for ELAM .
( 4 ) HUVECs were incubated without ( - ) or with ( + ) LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) in the presence ( + ) and absence ( - ) of dexamethasone ( DEX , 0.1 uM ) .
When normalized for the content of actin mRNA , LPS stimulated a 234 % increase in mRNA for ELAM .
Dexamethasone did not affect the basal level of mRNA for ELAM-1 ( 98 % of control ) but completely inhibited the LPS-stimulated increase in mRNA for ELAM-1 ( 90 % inhibition ) .
Similar results were found in a second experiment .
( B ) HUVECs were incubated with ( + ) or without ( - ) IL-la ( 20 units/ml ) in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of dexamethasone ( 0.1 uM ) .
When normalized to the content of actin mRNA , dexamethasone inhibited the IL-la-induced increase in mRNA for ELAM-1 by 95 % without affecting basal levels of mRNA for ELAM-1 ( 104 % of control ) .
Similar results were found in a second experiment .
( C ) HUVECs were incubated with ( + ) or without ( - ) TNF-a ( 50 units/ml ) in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of dexamethasone ( 0.1 uM ) .
When normalized to the content of actin mRNA , dexamethasone did not affect either basal mRNA for ELAM-1 ( 97 % of control ) or the TNF-a-induced increment in mRNA for ELAM-1 ( 110 % of control ) .
Similar results were found in a second experiment .
hypothesis that the effects of steroids on the endothelium are mediated through glucocorticoid receptors .
Further confirmation is provided by the observation that cortisol , but not its inactive metabolite tetrahydrocortisol , inhibits endothelial cell responses to LPS .
The absence of a glucocorticoid-responsive element in the gene for EL AM-1 suggests that glucocorticoids must either interfere directly with a transcriptional regulator of ELAM-1 transcription or induce the synthesis of a second regulatory element .
Montgomery and co-workers ( 41 ) have demonstrated that NFKB regulatory elements are necessary ( but not sufficient ) for transcription of ELAM-1 .
Thus the induction by human glucocorticoid receptor ( hGR ) of the synthesis of a counterregulatory element such as IB could Medical Sciences : Cronstein et al .
account for the inhibition of ELAM-1 expression by dexa-methasone .
Steroid-receptor complexes also participate in protein-protein interactions with jun , preventing its interaction at AP-1 regulatory sites of the 5 ' flanking regions of appropriate genes ( 36 , 37 ) , although the AP-1 site present in the gene for ELAM-1 does not appear to participate in the regulation of ELAM-1 ( 41 ) .
Our results appear to differ from those of Bochner et al .
( 5 ) , who found that prolonged ( 24 hr ) treatment of microvascular endothelium from foreskin with glucocorticoids did not prevent LPS from modulating PMN adhesion , whereas , as we report here , treatment of HUVECs for 4 hr dramatically diminished adhesiveness .
The inefficacy of prolonged treatment with corticosteroids may have been due to `` desensiti-zation '' of hGR ( i.e. , complete depletion of hGR in the cytosol ) in the presence of high concentrations of agonist ( 42 ) .
Alternatively , occupancy of hGR may only transiently transactivate genes that regulate ELAM-1 transcription or translation , permitting subsequent activation of ELAM-1 transcription by LPS .
We were surprised to observe that dexamethasone did not inhibit accumulation of mRNA for ELAM-1 induced by TNF-a .
In parallel studies Ghezzi and Sipe ( 43 ) found that dexamethasone inhibited LPS-stimulated , but not TNF- or IL-1-stimulated , serum amyloid protein A secretion in mice .
Thus LPS , TNF , and IL-1 may induce the transcription of ELAM-1 by several different mechanisms , only some of which are sensitive to corticosteroids .
These experiments permit us to suggest a mechanism for the antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids : acting via their receptor , glucocorticoids prevent the recruitment of leukocytes at inflammatory loci by inhibiting the display of adhesive molecules on the surface of the endothelium .
This hypothesis rests on three separate lines of evidence : functional , at nanomolar concentrations glucocorticoids inhibit endotoxin-stimulated increases of endothelial adhesiveness for leuko-cytes ; phenotypic , at similar concentrations they inhibit the stimulated expression of adhesive molecules on the surface of HUVECs ; genotypic , glucocorticoids inhibit accumulation of mRNA for ELAM-1 in endotoxin- and IL-1-stimulated cells .
In addition to these direct receptor-mediated effects of glucocorticoids on the capacity of HUVECs to localize the inflammatory response , glucocorticoids also inhibit the ligand-induced release of cytokines ( IL-1 , IL-3 , and TNF-a ) by endothelial and other inflammatory cells ( 5-12 ) .
These findings suggest the general hypothesis that corticosteroids act as antiinflammatory agents by diminishing , directly and indi-rectly , the ability of HUVECs to direct leukocyte traffic into inflamed or infected tissue .
Our data also provide a reasonable explanation for the opposing effects of endotoxin and glucocorticoids in infection and immunity ( 15 , 16 ) .
