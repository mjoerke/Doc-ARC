We previously reported that Tax induced cell cycle progression from GO0/G1 phase to S and G2/M phases in human T-cell line Kit 225 cells .
To elucidate molecular mechanism of Tax-induced cell cycle progression , we systematically examined the effects of Tax on biochemical events associated with cell cycle progression .
Introduction of Tax into resting Kit 225 cells induced activation of the G1/S transition regulation cascade consisting of activation of cyclin dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2 ) and CDK4 , phosphorylation of the Rb family proteins and an increase in free E2F .
The kinase activation was found to result from - Tax-induced expression of genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules including cyclin D2 , cyclin E , E2F1 , CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 , and Tax-induced reduction of CDK inhibitors p19 '' ~* '' and p27 '' '' .
These modulations by Tax always paralleled the ability of Tax to activate the NF-xB transcription pathway .
These results indicate the important role of Tax-mediated trans-activation of the genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules in Tax-induced cell cycle progression .

Keywords : cell cycle ; E2F ; HTLV-I ; NF-xB ; Tax ; cyclin D2 Introduction Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) ( Hinuma et al. , 1981 ; Poiesz et al. , 1980 ; Yoshida et al. , 1982 ) , and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) ( Gessain et al. , 1985 ; Osame et al. , 1986 ) .
Accumulating evidence displays that Tax encoded by HTLV-I plays critical roles in leukemogenesis .
Introduction of the Tax gene induces phenotypic transformation in fibroblast cell lines ( Tanaka et al. , 1990 ) , persistent growth of primary T *Correspondence : K Ohtani Received 12 November 2000 ; revised 18 January 2001 ; accepted 24 January 2001 cells in vitro in the presence of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) ( Akagi et al. , 1995 ; Grassmann et al. , 1989 ) , and development of tumors and leukemia in mice in vivo ( Grossman et al. , 1995 ; Nerenberg et al. , 1987 ) .
These results indicate that Tax has growth stimulatory properties .
Tax was initially identified as a trans-acting transcriptional activator of the HTLV-I promoter in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( Felber et al. , 1985 ; Seiki et al. , 1986 ; Sodroski et al. , 1985 ) .
Tax was subsequently demonstrated to trans-activate transcription of various cellular genes involved in cell growth signaling , such as genes for growth factors , growth factor receptors , cytoplasmic signal transmitters , and nuclear transcription factors ( Yoshida , 1995 ) .
Trans-activation of the growth related cellular genes by Tax is thought to make cellular circumstances advantageous for cell growth .
Tax is considered to activate cellular genes through modulation of three transcription factors , cAMP responsive element binding factor ( CREB ) , serum responsive factor ( SRF ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) -xB ( Yoshida , 1995 ) .
Recent findings that Tax can interact with molecules involved in regulation of the cell cycle suggest that Tax may be directly implicated in cell cycle control .
Tax binds and inactivates p16 '' ~** , and suppresses expression of p18 '' , both of which are inhibitors of cyclin D-dependent kinases , suggesting the possibility that Tax lowers the threshold of activation of G1 cyclin dependent kinases ( CDKs ) ( Low et al. , 1997 ; Suzuki et al. , 1996 , 1999 ) .
Collectively , Tax is a potential oncoprotein which induces leukemogenesis presumably through functional modulation of molecules and genes related to growth signaling and cell cycle control .
It is still unclear how Tax-induced modulation is involved in the promotion of cell proliferation .
Cell proliferation is strictly controlled by the cell cycle .
Progression through G1 phase into S phase is controlled by CDKs which associate with cyclin Ds and cyclin E. One of the roles of these kinases in G1/S progression is phosphorylation of members of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ( Rb ) family , pRb , p130 and p1l07 , consequently activating the transcription factor E2F .
E2F plays crucial roles in G1/S progression by regulating various genes which encode molecules involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication .
It is important to use human T-cells arrested at GO/G1 phase to exactly evaluate effects of Tax on the cell cycle .

A control virus ( Ad-Con ) was also used .
Cells were further cultured in the absence of IL-2 for 24 , 48 and 72 h. As controls , mock infected cells were either cultured in the absence of IL-2 or restimulated with IL-2 .
Cells were harvested for staining DNA with propidium iodide , followed by flow suitable for this purpose , because it can be made quiescent by deprivation of IL-2 ( Hori et al. , 1987 ) .
We have reported that the expression of Tax in quiescent Kit 225 cells induced activation of endogenous E2F and cell cycle progression to S and G2/M phases ( Ohtani et al. , 2000 ) .
The same results were obtained with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes , which also grow in the presence of IL-2 , indicating that the ability of Tax to stimulate cell cycle progression is not specific to Kit 225 cells .
In this study , we systematically examined Tax-induced biochemical events leading to the activation of E2F with IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells .
Our results demonstrate that Tax induces the expression of a group of cellular genes encoding molecules for cell cycle control including genes for cyclin D2 , cyclin E , CDK2 and CDK4 .
As a consequence , CDK2 and CDK4 are activated , leading to phosphorylation of the Rb family proteins and augmentation of free E2F binding activity .
The ability of Tax mutants to induce these events always parallels the activation of NF-xB transcription pathway and promotion of the cell cycle .
This implies that Tax may play an important role in cell cycle progression through trans-activating cell cycle regulatory genes .
Results Kinetics of cell cycle progression induced by infection with the Tax recombinant virus We previously reported that expression of HTLV-I Tax in the human T-cell line Kit 225 , which was made quiescent by deprivation of IL-2 , caused cell cycle progression at 48 h after infection with the Tax-expressing recombinant adenovirus ( Ohtani et a/. , 2000 ) .
To examine biochemical events associated with Tax-induced cell cycle progression , we first compared the kinetics of cell cycle progression induced by Tax with that by IL-2 .
Kit 225 cells were IL-2-starved for 48 h and Tax was introduced by infection with the Tax recombinant virus ( AxCAIY-Tax ) .
In parallel , mock infected cells were either kept IL-2-starved or restimulated with IL-2 .
Cells were then examined for cell cycle properties .
Restimulation with IL-2 for 24 h dramatically increased population of cells in S and G2/M phases ( from 14.9 to 63.7 % ) , which declined to 47.9 % at 48 h and 36.7 % at 72 h post stimulation ( Figure 1A ) .
Cells kept IL-2-starved for 72 h showed a small population ( down to 11 % ) in S and G2/M phases .
Infection with the Tax recombinant virus did not change the population of cells in S and G2/M phases until 24 h after infection .
Afterwards , the population of cells in S and G2/M phases increased with time ; up to 19.7 and 24.3 % at 48 h and 72 h after infection , respectively , while infection Mechanism of cell cycle progression by HTLV-I Tax R Iwanaga et al with a control virus did not show any appreciable change ( Figure 1A ) .
These results indicate that cell cycle progression induced by Tax is a gradual process as compared to that induced by IL-2 .
To address the reason of the slow cell cycle progression , we examined the kinetics of Tax expression in the virus infected cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis .
A small portion ( 20.5 % ) of Kit 225 cells was positive for Tax at 24 h after infection ( Figure 1B ) .
Tax positive cells increased to 42 % at 48 h and 49 % at 72 h. These results indicate that more than 24 h was required for maximum expression of Tax when Tax was introduced by adenovirus infection .
It should be noted that even 72 h after infection only half the population of Kit 225 cells were positive for Tax ( Figure 1B ) , presumably reflecting infection efficiency .
The population of cells in S and G2/ M phases did not further increase at later time points ( data not shown ) .
When Tax positive cells were gated , the population of cells in S and G2/M phases was 24.5 % at 24 h after infection and increased up to 35 % at 48 h and 40.3 % at 72 h , indicating a time lag in the progression of the cell cycle after Tax expression .
This suggests that a cascade of events is induced by Tax for the cell cycle to be promoted .
Based on these results , biochemical events associated with the regulation of the cell cycle were examined 24 h , 48 h and 72 h after infection with Tax recombinant viruses .
As reported previously ( Ohtani et al. , 2000 ) , infection with a mutant Tax recombinant adenovirus ( AxCAIY-Taxd3 ) capable of activating the NF-xB and SRF pathways but not CREB pathway promoted cell cycle progression ( Figure 1A ) .
Whereas another Tax mutant ( AxCAIY-Taxd17/5 ) incapable of activating any of these pathways was ineffective .
To determine whether the NF-xB pathway or SRF pathway is responsible for Tax-mediated cell cycle progression , we examined the ability of another recombinant adenovirus ( AxCAIY-TaxM22 ) carrying a mutant Tax gene capable of activating the CREB and SRF pathways but not NF-xB pathway .
No significant increase in the population of cells in S and G2/M phases was seen in cells infected with AxCAIY-TaxM22 virus ( Figure 1A ) .
Western blot analysis showed amounts of Tax and mutant Tax proteins were comparable among cells infected with these viruses ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that the ability of Tax to induce cell cycle progression coincides with the ability of Tax to activate the NF-xB pathway as far as examined .
Increase in free E2F by Tax Since Tax activated endogenous E2F activity in IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells ( Ohtani et al. , 2000 ) , we addressed the question of how Tax affected expression of the E2F cytometric examination .
Populations of cells in S and G2/M phases were indicated .
( B ) Cell cycle progression in Tax-expressing cells .
Kit 225 cells infected with AxCAIY-Tax as in ( A ) were stained for Tax and DNA with anti-Tax monoclonal antibody , Lt-4 , and propidium iodide , respectively .
Cells expressing ( Tax + ) and not expressing Tax ( Tax - ) were gated and examined for DNA content with a flow cytometer .
Populations of cells positive and negative for Tax and cells in S and G2/M phases were indicated 2057 Oncogene 2058 Mechanism of cell cycle progression by HTLV-I Tax R Iwanaga et al family members .
E2F 1 mRNA levels increased 3.5-fold in cells infected with the wild type Tax recombinant virus at 24 h and further increased 4.5- and 3.6-folds at 48 h and 72 h , respectively ( Figure 2A ) .
The levels of mRNAs were normalized by the expression of GAPDH mRNA as stimulation with IL-2 or Tax also increased GAPDH mRNA .
A slight increase ( up to 1.5-fold ) was observed with E2F4 mRNA at 48 h. In contrast , E2F2 mRNA levels clearly decreased in cells infected with the Tax recombinant virus to 24 and 19 % at 48 h and 72 h , respectively .
E2F3 mRNA levels did not change significantly .
Western blot analysis showed increase in E2F1 protein 48 h and 72 h after infection ( Figure 2B ) .
The status of endogenous E2F in cells infected with the Tax recombinant viruses was further examined using gel mobility shift assay with a probe of the typical E2F binding site from the DHFR gene ( Ikeda et al. , 1996 ) .
A major complex , in cell lysate from IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells , was confirmed by supershift with antibodies to be the p130 complex which is known to be dominant in quiescent cells ( Figure 3A , B , left panels ) ( Smith et a/. , 1996 ) .

Tax induced decrease in p130 complex and formation of the slowest migration complex ( S phase complex ) , which was either supershifted or abolished by addition of antibodies against p130 , p107 , E2F4 , CDK2 and cyclin A , indicating that the complex contained p130 , p107 , E2F4 , CDK2 and cyclin A .
No appreciable change was observed in cells 24 h after infection with the wild type Tax recombinant virus .
Similar complex formation was seen with cells stimulated with IL-2 with advanced kinetics ( Figure 3A left panel and B middle panel ) .
Since it was found that among the E2F family only E2F4 was detected as a free molecule , we tried to detect binding activity of the other members of the E2F family .
To release E2F from the complexes with Rb family proteins , cell lysates were pretreated with deoxycholic acid ( DOC ) .
Even after treatment with DOC , binding activities of E2F1 , E2F2 and E2F3 were only detected as supershifts with antibodies against those E2F molecules ( Figure 3B right panel ) .
Under the same conditions , E2F4 binding activity increased with time after infection with the wild type Tax 48 h 72 h Taxd17/5 Taxd3 TaxM22 IL-2 + Con Tax Taxd17/5 Taxd3 TaxM22 IL-2 48 h 72 h E , g E .

( A ) Effects of Tax on E2F binding activity .
Whole cell lysates were prepared from Kit 225 cells infected with indicated Tax recombinant adenoviruses and cells left IL-2-starved or restimulated with IL-2 as in Figure 1A .
E2F binding activity in the lysates were examined by gel mobility shift assay using typical E2F sites from DHFR as a probe , without ( DOC - ) or with ( DOC + ) DOC treatment .
The same probe was used as a competitor in the IL-2-stimulated lane ( IL-2+ , Comp+ ) .
S phase and p130 complexes , and free E2F4 were indicated .
( B ) Supershift analysis of E2F complexes and free E2Fs .
Antibodies indicated were added to the reactions 10 min before the addition of the probe .
Lysates were prepared from IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells ( left panel ) , cells stimulated with IL-2 for 24 h ( middle upper panel ) or cells 72 h after infection with the Tax recombinant virus ( middle lower panel ) .
Free E2Fs were released by DOC treatment ( DOC + ) of lysates from cells stimulated with IL-2 for 24 h ( right upper panel ) or by Tax for 72 h ( right lower panel ) 2059 Oncogene Mechanism of cell cycle progression by HTLV-I Tax R Iwanaga et al analysis with antibodies for pRb and p130 detected two close but distinct bands ; the upper and lower bands represent hyperphosphorylated and unphosphorylated /hypophosphorylated forms , respectively .
Infection with the Tax recombinant virus increased the ratio of phosphorylated forms to unphosphorylated ones of both Rb family members similar to stimulation with IL-2 which phosphorylated the molecules more efficiently than Tax with advanced kinetics ( Figure 4 ) .
It should be considered that effect of Tax appeared only in a half of the population of cells because of the infection efficiency .
Similar increases in phosphorylation of the Rb family members were seen with cells infected with the mutant Taxd3 recombinant virus that could also induce E2F activation and cell cycle progression .
Other mutants , Taxd17/5 and TaxM22 , were not effective .
Amounts of p107 increased with a slight shift in mobility after expression of either Tax or Taxd3 like stimulation with IL-2 .
These results indicate that Tax has the ability to induce phosphorylation of the Rb family members coincided with cell cycle progression .
Based on these observations , we speculated that Tax induced activation of G1 CDKs .
Activation of G1 cyclin dependent kinases by Tax D-type CDKs ( CDK4 and CDK6 ) are responsible for phosphorylation of the Rb family members .
In addition cyclin E expressed at G1/S boundary is also involved in phosphorylation of the Rb family members through activation of CDK2 .
We thus examined whether expression of Tax induced activation of CDK2 and CDK4 in IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells Cell lysates prepared from Kit 225 cells 24 h , 48 h and 72 h after infection with the Tax recombinant virus were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies for CDK2 and CDK4 .
The immunoprecipitates were examined for their kinase activities using GST-Rb and histone H1 as substrates .
As controls , cells either kept IL-2-starved or restimulated with IL-2 were used .
Any anti-CDK4 antibody-mediated immunoprecipi- tates from cells 24 h post infection showed the same background levels of kinase activities as that from IL-2-starved cells .
Further culture of cells for 48 h and 72 h after infection induced CDK4 kinase activity ( Figure 5 ) .
Similar activation was seen with cells infected with the mutant Taxd3 recombinant virus but not other mutant Tax ( Taxd17/5 and TaxM22 ) recombinant viruses .
Rb kinase activity associated with anti-CDK6 antibody-mediated immunoprecipitates could not be detected under similar conditions ( data not shown ) .
Kinase activity associated with anti-CDK2-mediated immunoprecipitates from cells infected with the Tax and mutant Taxd3 recombinant viruses phosphorylated GST-Rb and histone H1 with the same time course as that with CDK4 .
CDK4 and CDK2 were activated by IL-2 stimulation with advanced kinetics .
These results indicate that Tax induces the activation of CDK4 and CDK2 with kinetics coinciding with that of cell cycle progression induced by Tax .
Effect of Tax on CDK inhibitors CDK inhibitors are regulatory molecules for kinase activity of CDK complexes .
Kit 225 cells have been found to express little or no detectable level of p16'*~ '' * , indicating that activation of G1 CDKs by Tax is independent of p16N** ( Ohtani et al. , 2000 ) .
Thus we examined whether Tax affected the expression of CDK inhibitors p15 '' , p18 '' , p21© ' and p27°®P !
at mRNA and protein levels .
Tax has been shown to repress promoter activity of the p18 '' ~** '' gene ( Suzuki et al. , 1999 ) .
Northern blot hybridization with a probe specific for the p18 '' gene detected three distinct bands ( Figure 6A ) .
The middle band appeared after introduction of Tax and increased in density with time .
High molecular weight species of mRNA for p18 '' also increased by Tax as well as IL-2 .
These results clearly demonstrate that Tax rather induces the expression of p18 '' at transcriptional level .
No significant change in amount of p18 '' protein was seen by Tax introduction and IL-2 treatment ( Figure 6B ) .

Cell lysates were prepared from Kit 225 cells infected with indicated recombinant adenoviruses and cells left IL-2-starved or restimulated with IL-2 as in Figure 1A .
As a control , cells starved of IL-2 for 48 h ( 0 h in figure ) were also used .
Cell lysates ( 100 ug ) were immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK4 or anti-CDK2 antibodies and kinase activities of the immunoprecipitates were measured by in vitro kinase assay using GST-Rb or histone H1 as substrates Tax gradually reduced the expression of the p19 '' gene down to 67 % 72 h after infection ( Figure 6A ) .
A profound decrease in protein was detected 48 h after infection , presumably indicating that Tax may affect p19 '' ~** '' post-transcriptionally ( Figure 6B ) .
No appreciable change in the expression of p15 '' N '' ** '' was seen after introduction of Tax at both mRNA and protein levels .
Expression of the p27¢ '' ' gene was significantly decreased down to 50 % at 48 h and 72 h after infection in association with decrease in the amount of protein .
These decreases were seen with cells either treated with IL-2 or infected with the mutant Taxd3 recombinant virus but not other mutant viruses .
Interestingly , the p21© '' '' gene was not expressed in quiescent cells and induced by Tax introduction and protein levels increased with time after infection .
Tax-mediated modulation of gene expression involved in CDK activity Modulation of cyclin and CDK expression by Tax could be one of mechanisms by which CDK activity was enhanced in Tax-expressing cells We then examined the effects of Tax on expression of cyclins and CDKs by Northern and Western blot analyses .
Cyclin D2 mRNA increased fourfold 24 h after infection , even when only a marginal progression of the cell cycle was induced by Tax ( Figure 7A ) .
Elevation of cyclin D2 mRNA levels by Tax remained until 72 h. Cyclin D2 protein was detected 48 h and 72 h after infection with the Tax and mutant Taxd3 recombinant viruses by Western blot analysis ( Figure 7B ) .
Except for these two points , little , if any , or no expression of cyclin D2 protein was seen , even though mRNA for cyclin D2 was detected .
These results indicate that Tax induces endogenous cyclin D2 through activation of the cyclin D2 gene expression prior to progression of cell cycle by Tax .
Expression of cyclin D3 was not significantly affected by Tax at both mRNA and protein levels .
A twofold increase in cyclin E mRNA was observed in cells infected with the Tax recombinant virus at 48 h , but Western blot analysis showed no significant change in cyclin E protein .
Quiescent Kit 225 cells showed undetectable or background level of mRNA for cyclin A .
Tax clearly induced expression of mRNA for cyclin A at 48 h after infection , and the induced levels of the expression remained until 72 h. Levels of mRNA for CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 were all elevated in cells with wild type Tax and mutant Taxd3 with slightly different kinetics .
cdk2 mRNA levels were induced three and eightfolds at 48 h and 72 h after infection , respectively .
cdk4 mRNA similarly increased by two and fourfolds .
Twofold increase in cdk6 mRNA by Tax was detected 24 h after infection and was kept at the same level until 72 h. Increase in CDK2 and CDK4 proteins was also detected at 72 h as shown by Western blot analysis and increase in CDK6 protein by Tax was observed at 24 h through 72 h. Kinetics of induction of cdc2 mRNA by Tax were similar to that of cyclin A .
Many of the changes induced by Tax were also induced by mutant Taxd3 but not by other mutants , TaxM22 and Taxd17/5 , with the exception of cdk6 , indicating that ability to transactivate the NF-xB pathway is important for modulation of expression these genes by Tax .
TaxM22 induced cdk6 expression , indicating that CREB and/or SRF transcription pathway is sufficient for induction of cdk6 .
Discussion The present study clearly demonstrates that Tax activates G1 CDKs , which are shown to be the key regulators of the G1 to S phase transition .
The activation presumably results from modulation of the expression of a set of genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules .
Our observations underscore the importance of the transactivating function of Tax in cell growth stimulation in that not only inducing growth signaling molecules but also inducing cell cycle regulatory molecules .

( A ) Effects of Tax on mRNA expression of CDK inhibitors .
mRNAs ( 4 ug ) prepared from Kit 225 cells infected with indicated Tax recombinant adenoviruses and cells left IL-2-starved or restimulated with IL-2 as in Figure 1A were analysed by Northern blotting .
( B ) Western blot analysis .
Cell lysates were prepared from Kit 225 cells infected with indicated recombinant adenoviruses and cells left IL-2-starved or restimulated with IL-2 as in Figure 1A Initiation of cell cycle progression in cells infected with the Tax recombinant adenoviruses was significantly later than by stimulation with IL-2 .
One of the reasons may be attributable to the time lag in the expression of Tax from the recombinant virus as shown by FACS analysis ( Figure 1B ) .
Cells require 48-72 h after infection to accumulate enough Tax for cell cycle progression .
Another reason is that only half population of the cells infected with the virus expressed Tax even at 72 h. Thus the effects of Tax appeared only in a half of the population when the whole population of cells was analysed .
We previously demonstrated that Tax activated endogenous E2F , resulting in activation of the Oncogene promoters of a series of genes with the E2F binding sites ( Ohtani et al. , 2000 ) .
The present study further demonstrates that Tax releases active E2F4 from the complex with the Rb family members .
Tax has not been known to directly associate with the Rb family members , thus it is less likely that Tax directly modifies the pRb-E2F complex unlike oncogene products of DNA tumor viruses such as the T antigen of SV40 and Ela of adenovirus ( Nevins , 1992 ) .
These observations imply that the generation of active E2F4 is a result of indirect effects of Tax , presumably due to phosphorylation of the Rb family members , in particular p130 .

Cell lysates were prepared from Kit 225 cells infected with indicated recombinant adenoviruses and cells left IL-2-starved or restimulated with IL-2 as in Figure 1A .
Western blots were carried out with 40 ug of sample proteins .
Cell lysates from MT-2 and MOLT-4 cells were used as controls for cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 , respectively .
Cyclin D2 molecules are indicated by arrows and protein levels .
Although the activity of E2F1 to shift assay , it may contribute to activation of bind to the DNA element was not detected in our gel _ endogenous E2F by Tax .
Oncogene Mechanism of cell cycle progression by HTLV-I Tax R Iwanaga et al 2064 Kinase activities responsible for phosphorylation of the Rb family members were monitored in cells after Tax expression .
In vitro kinase assay showed that Tax induced activation of CDK4 and CDK2 in quiescent Kit 225 .
The same assay failed to detect kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates mediated by anti-cyclin D2 and anti-cyclin D3 antibodies ( data not shown ) , thus it is not known which cyclin is involved in Tax-induced activation of CDK4 .
We demonstrated that Tax trans-activated the cyclin D2 gene , but not cyclin D3 gene , resulting in elevation of the cyclin D2 protein level .
It may be possible that cyclin D2 is involved , at least in part , in the induction of activation of CDK4 in Tax-expressing cells .
cdk4 was tanscriptionally up-regulated by Tax .
It is therefore likely that there could be a close link between Tax-induced increases in amount and activity of CDK4 .
Tax profoundly decreased the amount of p19 '' ~ '' * '' protein , which could also contribute to activation of CDK4 .
The level of cyclin E , which binds and regulates CDK2 , did not fluctuate between quiescent and Tax-expressing cells , although its mRNA level was induced twofolds by Tax .
Tax thus seemed to induce activity of CDK2 in a cyclin E-independent manner .
In this context , it should be noted that the expression of CDK2 was elevated by Tax at both mRNA and protein levels .
Tax-dependent increase in the amount of CDK2 may be the main cause of induction of CDK2 activity .
Another possibility is sequestration of p27 '' by cyclin D2 and CDK4 increased by Tax , leading to activation of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex that may phosphorylate p27¢ '' .
Consequently level of p27 '' is reduced by ubiquitin-mediated degradation .
In addition , induction of cyclin A by Tax may also contribute to activation of CDK2 .
The integration of these modulations induced by Tax probably leads to the activation of CDKs .
Kinase activities of CDK4 and CDK2 in cells infected with the Tax recombinant virus were activated at 48 h and were most evident at 72 h in contrast to those induced by IL-2 which were most evident at 24 h. All of the events downstream of activation of G1 CDKs such as phosphorylation of Rb family proteins , down regulation of p27¢ '' '' and induction of free E2F4 were induced at 24 h by stimulation with IL-2 and at 72 h by Tax .
These results suggest that Tax-induced cell cycle progression seems to be associated with activation of G1 CDKs .
Unlike other cell cycle regulatory events which are activated at 48 h through 72 h by Tax , the cyclin D2 , E2F1 and cdk6 genes were activated by Tax as early as 24 h when activation of CDKs and progression to S and G2/M phases were not yet observed .
These observations suggest that the induction of the three genes is the primary effect mediated by Tax .
It may be expected that Tax induces the same group of genes to the same extent as stimulation with IL-2 .
It is intriguing to note that , there are differences in induction of cell cycle regulatory genes between Tax and IL-2 .
Tax stimulated the expression of the cyclin E , p21° '' '' and cdk6 genes that were not significantly Oncogene affected by IL-2 .
Induction of E2F1 , cdk2 and edk4 genes by Tax was much stronger than that with stimulation with IL-2 .
Moreover , IL-2 induced the upper band of pl8 '' ~** , whereas Tax induced the middle band .
These results imply that Tax does have the distinct effects on cell cycle regulatory genes from IL-2 , indicating that Tax does not simply stimulate growth signaling pathway induced by IL-2 .
These results support the notion that Tax directly mediates induction of cell cycle regulatory genes rather than through growth signaling pathway .
Tax greatly induced expression of at both mRNA and protein levels .
High expression of p21©® '' '' mRNA has been reported in HTLV-I transformed cell lines ( Akagi et al. , 1996 ) , suggesting that induction of p21© '' '' by Tax is not specific to Kit 225 cells .
The biological significance of induction of p21° '' '' by Tax is not known at present .
p21° » '' may facilitate assembly of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 with CDK4 and CDK6 ( LaBaer et al. , 1997 ) , contributing in activation of D-type CDKs .
Further studies are needed for elucidation of role ( s ) of p21° '' '' induced by Tax .
One of the striking results in the present study is that the ability of Tax to activate the NF-xB pathway is closely associated with activation of a set of endogenous cell cycle regulatory genes .
As shown in our previous study ( Ohtani et al. , 2000 ) , exogenous introduction of active NF-xB complex is not effective in activation of E2F .
Tax may activate yet unidentified pathways that are also necessary for cell cycle progression .
The speculation may be enforced by our previous observation that Tax expressed in rat fibroblast trans-activates the NF-xB sites but does not activate E2F ( Ohtani et al. , 2000 ) .
As a consequence of activation of G1 CDKs by Tax , phosphorylation of the Rb family members was induced as shown by Western blot analyses ( Figure 4 ) .
Consistent with phosphorylation of p130 , the p130/ E2F4 complex disappeared and free E2F4 binding activity and the S phase complex were induced in Tax expressing cells ( Figure 3A ) .
Recently a murine pro-B cell line , Ba/F3 , has been shown to have p130 as a regulator of cell growth inhibition rather than pRb ( Hoshikawa et al. , 1998 ) .
In addition , the growth inhibitory effect of p130 was abrogated by expression of E2F4 .
Thus , p130 and E2F4 are thought to be major determinants of cell growth of lymphoid lineage .
Much knowledge concerning regulation of Rb/E2F complex has been obtained by investigations with fibroblast cells ( Dyson , 1998 ) .
These studies have revealed that a shift from the p130/E2F complex at GO phase to p107/E2F complex at S phase is observed in fibroblasts .
In Kit 225 cells , however , this shift is not dramatic as in fibroblasts and the p130/E2F complex remains at S phase .
The difference may reflect differential usage of Rb family members in different tissues .
In summary , our results demonstrate that the transactivating ability of Tax is important in Tax-induced cell cycle promotion with the identification of a group of cell cycle regulatory genes as new targets of Tax .
Elucidation of yet unknown targets of Tax-mediated trans-activation should provide further insights into understanding cell growth promotion and eventually leukemogenesis induced by Tax .
