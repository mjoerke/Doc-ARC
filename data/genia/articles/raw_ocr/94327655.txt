ZAP-70 Tyrosine Kinase , CD45 , and T Cell Receptor Involvement in UV- and H,0 , -induced T Cell Signal Transduction* ( Received for publication , January 25 , 1994 , and in revised form , May 10 , 1994 ) Gary L.

Ledbetter From the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute , Seattle Washington 98121 and the §Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute , Princeton , New Jersey 08543 Several mammalian responses to UV irradiation , including the activation of NF- « B , are believed to involve tyrosine phosphorylation .
UV irradiation and H , O , treatment of T lymphocytes induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca* signals similar to those observed following biological stimulation .
We have examined the role of cell surface molecules in these responses .
Normal T lymphocytes whose surface expression of CD3 was depleted showed impaired UV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca** signals .
Similarly , Jurkat T cell lines deficient in CD3 or CD45 expression also gave impaired UV responses .
However , all these cell types still gave strong Ca** and tyrosine phosphorylation responses to H,0 , .
The T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 was found to be highly responsive to UV and H,0 , treatment .
ZAP-70 responsiveness to UV required expression of both CD3 and CD45 , whereas only CD3 was required for the response to H,0 , .
UV-induced activation of NF- « B was blocked by CD3 depletion , indicating the importance of such cell surface molecules in biological responses to UV .
In non-lymphoid cells , the epidermal growth factor receptor displayed increased tyrosine phosphorylation within seconds of UV irradiation .
These results suggest that UV-induced signal transduction is mediated via cell surface receptors that normally respond to biological stimulation , whereas H , O , is able to partially bypass this requirement .
UV is well known to induce DNA damage by the formation of pyrimidine dimers , resulting in mutations and carcinogenesis ( 1 ) , and most research on cellular UV responses has focused on these effects .
Recently , however , a number of studies have demonstrated that UV irradiation of cells can also act on signal transduction pathways .
In Hela cells , UV irradiation was found to activate the Src and Fyn tyrosine kinases , leading to induction of c-jum via a pathway involving Ha-Ras and Raf-1 ( 2 ) .
A c-Jun amino-terminal kinase , JNK , has been reported to be highly responsive to UV irradiation of cells and to be required for UV activation of c-Jun ( 3 , 4 ) .
The activation of NF- « B and induction of HIV-1 promoter activation by UV has been reported to be blocked by either dominant negative Sre or Ras ( 5 ) .
Furthermore , this activation of NF- « B by UV irradiation was found to occur in enucleated cells , indicating that it was independent of DNA damage .
We have found that UV irradiation of T and B cells strongly induces tyrosine phosphorylation * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

Taken together , these results suggest that a variety of tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways can be activated by UV .
The mechanism by which UV activates such pathways has not been defined .
We have employed lymphocytes as a model system to further investigate the basis for UV-induced signal transduction .
Lymphocytes are highly sensitive to the shorter UVC and UVB wavelengths , with little biological effect occurring for the longer wavelength UVA radiation ( 7 ) .
T lymphocytes show markedly reduced responses to mitogens following UV irradiation ( 8 ) , and irradiation has also been reported to block development of effector cell function ( 9 ) .
Mixed lymphocyte responses are inhibited when stimulator cells are irradiated with UV , and UV has improved graft survival in multiple transplantation models ( 10 ) .
In addition to the sensitivity of lymphocytes to UV , the increasing definition of the tyrosine kinase signal pathways regulating lymphocyte function ( 11 ) also makes lymphocytes an attractive model system for the investigation of the mechanism of UV-induced signal transduction .
Two major signal pathways important to lymphocyte activation are tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca** mobilization .
We have previously found that UV irradiation of Jurkat T cells resulted in both rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins and Ca** mobilization ( 6 ) .
The UV induction of signals was wavelength dependent , with the biologically active UVB and UVC wavelengths inducing strong signals .
In contrast , UVA showed little effect .
The Ca* signals in T cells appeared to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC'y1 and SH2Z-associated proteins ( 6 ) .
UV also strongly induced tyrosine phosphorylation in Ramos B cells , but only very small Ca** signals were observed ( 6 ) .
Normal human peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets showed a similar pattern , with CD4* and CD8 cells giving strong Ca** signals , whereas other cells did not ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in T ( 6 ) and B ( 12 ) cells was similar for both UV and antigen receptor-stimulated signals .
UV radiation is known to induce free radical formation in irradiated tissues such as skin , in a process involving lipid peroxidation ( 13 ) .
Furthermore , the free radical scavenger N-acetyl cysteine has been reported to attenuate the activation of Sre by UV irradiation of HeLa cells ( 2 ) .
The free radical generator H , O , has been found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation in T and B cells ( 12 , 14-16 ) .
We have previously reported that the Syk tyrosine kinase in B cells is highly responsive to H,0 , treatment of cells and shows a somewhat lesser response to UV irradiation ( 14 ) .
Taken together , these results suggested that elements of T lymphocyte signal transduction pathways re 'The abbreviations used are : PLC , phospholipase C ; TCR , T cell receptor ; FACS , fluorescent activated cell sorter ; PHA , phytohemagglu-tinin ; SH2 , Sre homology domain 2 ; EGF , epidermal growth factor .
20718 Role of ZAP-70 , CD45 , and TCR in Response to UV and H , O , sponsive to biological stimulation might also play important roles in signals generated by UV irradiation or H,0 , .
In order to address these questions , in the present study we have compared the roles of the cell surface molecules CD3 , CD4 , and CD45 in T cells in the generation of signals by UV irradiation and H,0 , treatment .
We report that CD3 and CD45 expression are required for UV-induced signals , in contrast to results for H,0 , .
An important biological response to UV , the activation of the transcription factor NF- « B , could be blocked by prior antibody modulation of the T cell receptor component CD3 , indicating the importance of this cell surface molecule in UV responses by T cells .
Furthermore , the Syk-related T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 , which is essential for T cell responses to antigen receptor stimulation ( 17 ) and is associated with TCR components ( 11 ) , has been found to be highly responsive to both UV irradiation and H , O , treatment of T cells .

Effect of anti-CD3 modulation on UV-induced Ca* signals .
Human PHA-induced T cell blasts were treated 20 h with 5 ug/ml of the monoclonal antibody G19-4 to modulate CD3 .
The base-line level of intracellular free Ca* ( [ Ca® ] 1 , ) was established for 1 min , and then the cells were irradiated with 1200 J/m '' UVC .
Immediately after irradiation , [ Ca ] ; levels were measured .

RESULTS Modulation of CD3 Inhibits UV-induced Ca®* Signals and Tyrosine Phosphorylation in T Cells-The similarity between Ca** signals and tyrosine phosphorylation induced by both CD3 stimulation and UV irradiation ( 6 , 12 ) led us to examine the role of CD3 and the TCR in UV-induced signals in T cells .
Prolonged treatment of T cells with monoclonal antibodies to CD3 results in the modulation of CD3 ( 30 ) .
When surface expression of CD3 is precluded due to the antibody-induced in-ternalization , T cells are no longer responsive to antigen ( 30 ) .
We therefore modulated CD3 on human PHA-induced T cell blasts in order to examine the role of CD3 UV signaling .
As shown in Fig .
1 , normal PHA-induced T cell blasts showed a substantial Ca** signal in response to UV irradiation , consistent with our previous findings for the T cell line Jurkat and CD4* and CD8* peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 6 , 12 ) .
By contrast , the CD3-modulated cells showed no Ca®** signals in response to UV irradiation ( Fig .
1 ) .

Effect of anti-CD3 modulation on UV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation .
Cells were treated 16h with 5 ug/ml G19-4 to modulate CD3 .
The cells were then stimulated with either 10 ug/ml G19-4 or irradiated with 1200 J/m UVC .
After 30 s , the cells were lysed and assayed for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
induced Ca** signals in that cell type . !
Since UV-induced Ca* signals in T cells are linked to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCy1 and its SH2-associated proteins ( 6 ) , we examined the cellular tyrosine phosphorylation responses of the PHA blasts .
As shown in Fig .
2 , stimulation of cells with either G19-4 or UV irradiation gave a strikingly similar pattern of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation .
The similarity for the PHA blasts was even greater than that previously observed for Jurkat T cells ( 6 ) .
The CD3-modulated PHA blasts gave no cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in response to G19-4 treatment , as would be expected in cells not expressing CD3 on their surface , demonstrating the efficacy of the CD3 modula-tion .
The UV-induced cellular tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly inhibited in the CD3 modulated cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Only a few species , notably a 70-kDa protein , showed a small tyrosine phosphorylation response to UV irradiation .
Response of ZAP-70 Tyrosine Kinase to UV and H,0 , -The finding that modulation of CD3 inhibited the UV-induced Ca** and tyrosine phosphorylation signals suggested that CD3 or other members of the T cell receptor complex play an essential role in UV signaling .
ZAP-70 is a key T cell tyrosine kinase that is responsive to CD3 stimulation ( 23 ) .
Furthermore , stimulation via the TCR results in the association of tyrosine phosphorylated ZAP-70 kinase with tyrosine phosphorylated £ and e chains of the TCR via the tandem ZAP-70 SH2 domains ( 31 , 32 ) .
The importance of ZAP-70 in TCR-mediated signal transduction has been demonstrated by the finding that patients with selective T cell deficiency have mutations in ZAP-70 , which result in their CD4* T cells being non-responsive to TCR stimulation ( 17 ) .
We therefore examined the response of ZAP-70 to UV and H,0 , treatment of Jurkat T cells .
Immune complex kinase assays revealed ZAP-70 to be highly responsive to UV , as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of the ZAP-70 protein ( Fig .
3 ) .
The UV response was somewhat greater ( a 4.3-fold increase in phosphorylation by PhosphorImager analysis ) than that elicited by the biological stimulation +J .

ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase response to UV radiation , H,0 , , and anti-CD3 treatment .
Jurkat cells were either untreated ( 0 ) , irradiated with 1200 J/m UVC , treated for 1 min with 7.5 my H,0 , , or treated with 10 ug/ml G19-4 .
Immune complex kinase assays of ZAP-70 were performed , and the phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography .
using G19-4 ( a 2.4-fold increase in phosphorylation ) .
As indicated in Fig .
3 , the level of ZAP-70 phosphorylation in kinase assays from cells treated with H,0 , ( a 7-fold increase ) was even greater than that observed following UV irradiation .
The strong response of ZAP-70 to H,0 , in the kinase assay led us to examine the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 in the cells .
Since H,0 , has been reported to induce cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells ( 15 , 16 ) , we compared the dose response of such protein phosphorylation to the response of ZAP-70 and also compared these H , O , responses to those induced by CD3 .
A dose of 1 mm H , O , induced cellular tyrosine phosphorylation to levels comparable to that observed following CD3 stimulation , although the relative proportions of each tyrosine phosphorylated species varied ( Fig .
44 ) .
Higher doses of H , O , up to 10 mx induced much stronger tyrosine phosphorylation .
In Fig .
4A , the panel at the right shows a longer exposure of the G19-4 lane in the main panel in order to show fainter bands more readily .
A strikingly similar , but non-iden-tical pattern of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for both H,0 , - and CD3-stimulated cells .
The tyrosine-phosphorylated species observed following CD3 stimulation were also apparent in the H , O , -treated cells , although relative amounts of individual species varied .
The tyrosine phosphorylation state of ZAP-70 in intact Jurkat cells in response to the same treatments was examined as shown in Fig .
4B .
No tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 was apparent in unstimulated cells , whereas CD3 stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both ZAP-70 and a low molecular weight protein appearing to correspond to the & chain of the TCR , as previously reported ( 33 ) .
H , O , treatment of Jurkat cells resulted in dose-dependent induction of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation , reaching levels substantially greater than those observed following CD3 stimulation ( 0.2- , 2.2- , 8.9- , 14.3- , and 15.8-fold greater than CD3 stimulation for H , O , doses of 1 , 2.5 , 5 , 7.5 , and 10 mm , respectively , by PhosphorImager analysis ) .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and ZAP-70 induced by H , O , relative to CD3 stimulation .
Jurkat cells received no stimulation ( 0 , in duplicate ) , were treated 1 min with anti-CD3 mAb G19-4 ( in duplicate ) or 5 min with the range of H , O , doses shown , and lysed .
A , cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting .
The panel at the right is a longer exposure of the G19-4 lane in the left panel to show greater detail in the autoradiogram .
B , immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-ZAP-70 antibody .
Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting was performed on the precipitated proteins following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
with ZAP-70 from H,0 , -treated cells .
These proteins could be associated either directly with ZAP-70 or indirectly via the { chain .
Tyrosine- phosphorylated p56 '' * and p59 '' '' could not be detectably reprecipitated with anti-p56 '' ** '' or p59 '' antibodies from anti-ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates , and the major tyrosine-phosphorylated species did not comigrate with p56 '' ** or p59 '' '' ( data not shown ) .
ZAP-70 Associates with the { and e Chains of the TCR Following H,0 , Treatment-Following stimulation via CD3 , activated ZAP-70 associates with the £ and e chains of the TCR ( 33 , 34 ) .
As described above , H , O , stimulation of Jurkat cells resulted in the recovery of low molecular weight proteins likely corresponding to the & chain in anti-ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates when examined by either anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting or kinase assays .
We therefore examined directly whether H,0 , treatment resulted in association of ZAP-70 with the e and £ chains of the TCR .
As a positive control , Jurkat cells were stimulated via CD3 with G19-4 F ( ab ' ) , so that the stimu- 20721 A. kDa 12 3 4 5 6 I t * 200- & T * 116- we 974-se z= « lei ame - < -ZAP-70 mo wee ap 42.7-e me as .

Association of active ZAP-70 with the e nd £ chains of the TCR following H,0 , treatment .
A , cells were untreated ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , stimulated with anti-CD3 ( Zanes 3 and 4 ) , or treated 5 min with 10 my H,0 , ( Zanes 5 and 6 ) .
Immunoprecipitations were performed with mAb G19-4 to the e chain of CD3 ( Zanes 1 , 3 , and 5 ) or with monoclonal 1D4.1 to the { chain of the TCR ( lanes 2 , 4 , and 6 ) followed by kinase assay .
B , phosphorylated ZAP-70 proteins from lane 5 ( left ) and lane 6 ( right ) were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis .
Labeled phosphoamino acids separated by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis were detected by autoradiography and identified by comigration with ninhydrin-stained standards .
lating antibody could not bind Protein A and thus would not be precipitated .
Following the CD3 stimulation , a 70-kDa phosphorylated protein was detected in both anti- ?
and anti-e immune complex kinase assays ( Fig .
5A ) , in agreement with previous reports identifying this protein as ZAP-70 ( 33 , 34 ) .
When the cells were treated with 10 mm H,0 , , even greater phosphorylation of ZAP-70 protein was observed in the immune complex kinase assays .
The £ and e chains were strongly phosphorylated in these assays .
Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation was on tyrosine ( Fig .
5B ) .
Expression of CD3 and CD45 Is Required for UV-induced Ca '' Signals and Tyrosine Phosphorylation-The CD3 modulation experiments suggested that surface expression of CD3 was essential for UV signals .
However , the act of modulating CD3 with G19-4 provides a powerful stimulation of the cells , which could have acted to desensitize the cells .
In T cells , cross-linking CD3 can result in heterologous desensitization to CD2 or CD28 cross-linking ( 35 ) .
In order to rule out such a possibility having occurred in the CD3 modulation experiments , we examined the responses of Jurkat cells defective in expression of CD3 , CD4 , and CD45 .
In response to UV irradiation , CD4 Jurkat cells displayed a Ca®* response whose initial amplitude was equal to that observed for control cells , but which declined more rapidly ( Fig .
6A ) .
By comparison , CD45~ CD4~ cells showed a greatly im- 20722 A .

paired Ca** response that was very slow in comparison to control cells .
In CD3~ CD4~ cells , the UV-induced Ca** response was even more strongly impaired .
These results confirmed the importance of CD3 expression in generating UV-induced Ca* signals and also suggested a role for CD45 .
In order to examine the specificity of these effects , we further examined the responses of these cell lines to H,0 , , which is known to induce Ca** responses in lymphocytes in a tyrosine kinase dependent mechanism ( 14 , 36 ) .
In contrast to the results for UV irradiation , all the cell types gave strong Ca** responses to H , O , stimulation ( Fig .
6B ) .
However , the responses for the CD3~ CD4- and the CD45~ CD4 : cells were slower than for the control or CD4~ cells .
Nonetheless , the maximal amplitudes of the responses for all the cell types were similar .
These findings led us to examine the cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and ZAP-70 responses to UV and H,0 , in these cells .
UV irradiation of the CD3~ CD4~ and the CD45 CD4 : cells did not induce cellular tyrosine phosphorylation , in contrast to the strong induction observed for control or CD4~ cells Role of ZAP-70 , CD45 , and TCR in Response to UV and H,0 , ( Fig .
7A ) .
In both the control and CD4~ cells , UV irradiation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase and its association with tyrosine phosphorylated £ chain ( Fig .
7B ) .
In contrast , UV irradiation did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 nor its association with the £ chain of the TCR in CD3~ CD4~ or CD45~ CD4~ cells .
The lack of tyrosine phosphorylated ZAP-70 in these cells was not due to a deficiency in ZAP-70 protein because all the cell types expressed ZAP-70 , and its recovery was not affected by UV irradiation or H , O , treatment ( Fig .
7C ) .
The CD3~ and CD45~ cells actually expressed ZAP-70 protein at over twice the level as control cells as determined by PhosphorImager analysis of the immunoblot shown in Fig .
7C .
These results indicate that expression of both CD3 and CD45 is required for the UV induction of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation , the activation of ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase , and the association of ZAP-70 with the £ chain .
In contrast to the results obtained following UV irradiation , treatment with H , O , resulted in extensive cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in all four Jurkat cell lines ( Fig .
7A ) , consistent with a previous report that H , O , could induce tyrosine phosphorylation in TCR negative and CD45 negative cells ( 15 ) .
However , substantial differences were observed in the patterns of the responses .
The CD4 cells displayed a higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation , but the species phosphorylated appeared virtually identical to the control cells .
In contrast , the CD3~ CD4~- cells showed differences in species at 102 , 61 , and 35-36 kDa relative to control cells .
The CD45~ CD4~ cells showed differences in species at 102 , 54 , and 35-36 kDa .
There were major differences in ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation among the cell types ( Fig .
7B ) .
PhosphorImager analysis of the immunoblot shown in Fig .
7B gave values of 2960 , 7705 , 342 , and 9809 units for ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation from control , CD4 , CD3 CD4 , and CD45~ CD4~ cells , respectively .
Taking into account the differences in ZAP-70 protein levels as measured by PhosphorImager analysis of the blot in Fig .
7C , the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 relative to a value of 1.0 for control cells was 1.7 , 0.06 , and 1.4 in CD4 , CD3~ CD4~ , and CD45~ CD4~ cells , respectively .
These results indicate H , O , induction of the ZAP-70 response is able to bypass the requirement for CD45 expression that is necessary for UV or anti-CD3 stimulations .
However , ZAP-70 is not responsive in the CD3~ cells , but substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins still occurs after H , O , treatment .
These results suggest that other tyrosine kinases are potentially able to phosphorylate many T cell substrates in the absence of a ZAP-70 response .
CD3 Modulation Blocks UV-induced Activation of NF- « B-UV radiation induces a specific pattern of gene expression in mammalian cells known as the mammalian UV response ( 37-39 ) .
This response is known to involve the activation of NF- « B ( 40 ) .
We therefore sought to examine the effects of changes in cell surface receptor expression on the activation of NF- « B .
The CD3- , CD4 , and CD45~ Jurkat cells had widely varying basal levels of activated nuclear NF- « B . ''
This prevented a comparison of UV-induced activation of NF- « B in the cells .
Stimulation of T cells with antibody to CD3 is known to activate NF- « B ( 41 , 42 ) .
Treatment of PHA blasts 16h with monoclonal antibody 619-4 to modulate CD3 resulted in a strong activation of NF-kB , precluding further measurement of activation by UV . ''
However , in the T cell line HPB-ALL , modulation of CD3 by treatment with G19-4 for 1-2 h did not result in activation of NF- « B , permitting measurement of subsequent UV-induced NF- « B activation ( Fig .
8 ) .

Modulation of CD3 blocks activation of NF-kB by UV radiation .
HPB-ALL cells were either untreated or treated with 5 ug/mL G19-4 for 1 , 1.5 , or 2 h. The cells were then centrifuged , washed one time with fresh media , and then either irradiated with 200 J/m '' UVC or mock-irradiated .
The cells were incubated in fresh media for 5 h and then assayed for NF-KB activation by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
NF- « B-specific DNA binding activity is indicated by the arrow .
nonspecific band was observed below the NF-kB band , as has been previously reported for human T lymphocytes ( 43 ) .
The activation of NF-kB by UV observed in untreated cells was strongly inhibited in the CD3-modulated cells .
The inhibition was observed for all the treatment times with G19-4 prior to UV irradiation .
These results indicate that surface expression of the TCR plays an important role in the UV-induced signal transduction pathway leading to NF-kB activation .
UV Irradiation Rapidly Induces EGF Receptor Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Since our results in the experiments on T cells described above indicated that cell surface molecules linked to tyrosine kinase activity were important in rapid UV-induced signal transduction in lymphoid cells , we sought to determine whether cell surface receptors might also be involved in such processes in non-lymphoid cell types .
We therefore examined A431 cells , an epidermal carcinoma cell line that 20723 / & I 3 y , § P $ $ £ 2 $ _ 8 J 8 y -- -3f -- -~4 f -- - ( u d u E : = $ 8.2z8.28.z 1 kDa 100- f 67- “ w vol cme `` ' , < 'ZAP-7O 42.t-274- ___ B « t C a < n om over expresses EGF receptor .
UV irradiation induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a large number of proteins in these cells within 30 s ( Fig .
9 ) .
Immunoprecipitation of the EGF receptor revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor also increased within 30 s after irradiation .
It has recently been reported that UV irradiation of either A431 cells or human epidermal cells results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor 30-60 min after UV irradiation ( 44 , 45 ) .
Our results demonstrate that such phosphorylation is in fact extremely rapid .
Taken together , these findings indicate that in non-lymphoid cells , UV irradiation activates receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor and that such responses are among the earliest that are observed .
DISCUSSION Two types of tyrosine kinases , the Syk family kinases and the Sre family kinases , appear to be involved in lymphocyte signal transduction by the TCR in T cells and sIg in B cells .
In T cells , several studies have provided genetic evidence of an important role for the Sre family kinases Lock and Fyn in T cell signaling and function ( 46-48 ) .
Furthermore , T cell receptor cross-linking has been shown to activate Fyn kinase activity ( 49 ) .
Coexpression of Lek or Fyn with ZAP-70 has been found to be essential for tyrosine phosphorylation and association of ZAP-70 with the £ chain ( 23 ) .
ZAP-70 associates only with £ chains after they have been tyrosine phosphorylated , and this association is mediated by the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 ( 32 , 34 ) , which also bind to tyrosine phosphorylated CD3 e chains ( 31 ) .
Lck kinase activity has been found to be essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the antigen recognition activation motifs in the £ and e chains that permit the association of ZAP-70 with the TCR and the subsequent phosphorylation of ZAP-70 ( 32 ) .
It has been reported that coexpression of a TCRB-£ fusion protein with Fyn in COS cells could result in Ca* signals in response to cross-linking of the fusion protein without the need for ZAP-70 ( 50 ) .
However , TCR-induced Ca* signals are markedly inhibited ( 17 ) in humans lacking ZAP-70 , indicating that ZAP-70 plays an important role in this process .
Furthermore , in the absence of ZAP-70 , very little cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and no interleukin-2 production was observed following CD3 stimulation ( 17 ) , further demonstrating the important role of ZAP-70 in TCR-induced signaling .
Although H,0 , treatment is known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca** signals in T cells ( 15 , 16 , 36 ) , the identity 20724 & y & ( A $ _ & Ce o uv ' o uv kDa * > mill - arp _ i 67-fud 42 .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including the EGF receptor in A431 cells .
A431 cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes .
Cells were either mock irradiated ( 0 ) , or irradiated with 2400 J/m UVC .
Cells were lysed 30 s after treatment , and cellular tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting .
Alternatively the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared 30 s after irradiation .
Tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting .
of the kinases involved has been unclear .
It has been reported that H , O , treatment of T cell blasts induces Lek tyrosine phosphorylation and that a much stronger response is observed following treatment with the sulfhydryl oxidizing agent diamide ( 16 ) .
Although the strong Lek tyrosine phosphorylation induced by diamide was found to occur at both the Tyr-394 autophosphorylation site and the Tyr-505 negative regulatory site , the weaker phosphorylation induced by H , O , was not analyzed ( 16 ) .
Similarly , diamide treatment of T cells was found to increase Lek enzymatic activity , but the effects of H , O , on Lek activity were not examined .
It should be noted that diamide treatment induces very strong aggregation of membrane proteins through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds ( 51 ) .
Lek is known to be activated following the cross-linking of a variety of cell surface proteins , including CD4 ( 52 ) , CD2 ( 53 ) , or a variety of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins such as CD59 ( 54 , 55 ) .
Thus , diamide might potentially induce Lck activity by aggregation of one or more of these proteins rather than by a mechanism involving oxidative stress alone .
In the present study we have demonstrated that UV or H , O , treatment led to a strong response of ZAP-70 in T cells .
There are as yet no known substrates that are specific for ZAP-70 kinase activity relative to other tyrosine kinases .
We therefore employed anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot assays and detection of ZAP-70 phosphorylation in immune complex kinase assays as have been used in other studies of ZAP-70 ( 17 , 23 , 31-33 , 56 ) .
In addition to the ZAP-70 phosphorylation re-sponse , H,0 , treatment led to the association of tyrosine phosphorylated ZAP-70 with the £ chains of the TCR and with CD3 e , as is known to occur following stimulation of T cells via the TCR .
Thus , H,0 , provides a pharmacologic treatment to mimic the biological response of ZAP-70 and may prove useful in the investigation of ZAP-70 regulation and in the identification of proteins that associate with ZAP-70 directly or indirectly ( Fig .
Role of ZAP-70 , CD45 , and TCR in Response to UV and H,0 , 4B ) .
We previously observed that H,0 , treatment of the T cell line CEM or the B cell line Ramos did not detectably induce Lek or Fyn activity , whereas Syk was found to be highly responsive in B cells to the same treatment ( 14 , 36 ) .
In the present study , the strong response of ZAP-70 in T cells to H , O , and UV parallels these earlier findings for Syk in B cells .
It is possible that Sre kinases in T cells might be very transiently activated by H,0 , in a manner not previously detected , and this would be an important area for future studies .
H,0 , treatment is known to inhibit cellular phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity ( 57 ) , including CD45 ( 15 ) .
With phosphatases inhibited , the basal levels of Lok and other Sre-family kinase activity may be sufficient to permit a ZAP-70 response to H,0 , .
Treatment of T cells with pervanadate , generated from the combination of H , O , and vanadate , has been reported to induce cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca '' signals much stronger than observed following biological stimulation or H , O , treatment , and also to induce the activation of Lek and Fyn ( 15 , 36 , 58 ) whereas an equal concentration of H , O , without vanadate did not ( 36 ) .
Furthermore , the combination of H,0 , plus vanadate can induce interleukin-2 receptor expression , whereas either alone can not ( 58 ) .
There are thus clear differences between the effects of H , O , and pervanadate on T cells and their signal pathways .
Our results indicate that the role of cell surface molecules differs between the UV and H,0 , responses , even though both treatments lead to a ZAP-70 response .
UV responses required expression of both CD3 and CD45 , the same as is required for antigen dependent stimulation of T cells , suggesting that UV utilizes pathways very similar to those employed by biological stimulation .
The requirement for cell surface molecules in the UV response was specific , in that H,0 , was able to at least partially bypass the requirement for cell surface receptors .
H , O , did not require CD45 expression , and substantial tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca** signals could occur in the absence of a ZAP-70 response .
The activity of other kinases such as Fyn might be responsible for this effect ( 50 ) .
Nonetheless , in wild-type cells TCR associated ZAP-70 was highly responsive to H,0 , and appeared to contribute to the cellular signaling since CD3~ and CD45~ cells showed altered responses .
Our results raise the possibility that an active process , namely the induction of signals , may contribute to the inhibition of T cell function induced by UV irradiation or oxidative stress in the form of H,0O , .
The role of such signals in the biological responses of the cells will be an important area for future research .
Recently , several enzymes capable of degrading H,0 , have been found to promote T cell growth .
Catalase has been identified as an autocrine growth factor for the CCREF-CEM human T cell line , permitting growth at low cell density in serum-free media ( 59 ) .
Catalase has also been shown to enhance T cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte response assays ( 60 ) and in response to phorbol ester-treated macrophages ( 61 ) .
Similarly , adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor , which acts as an autocrine growth factor , has been identified as thiore-doxin , an enzyme that can reduce oxidized protein thiols and catabolize H,0 , ( 62 ) .
The generation of H , O , has been shown to be a means by which neutrophils exert immunosuppressive effects ( 63 , 64 ) .
It will be important to determine whether oxidative stress induced by neutrophil or monocyte respiratory bursts can activate T cell signal pathways .
The role of signals in lymphocyte responses to UV will be another area for future study .
The induction of IL-10 by UV has been reported to contribute to systemic immunosuppression by UV in mice ( 65 ) .
It would be of interest to determine whether the production of IL-10 is induced by UV in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner .
Role of ZAP-70 , CD45 , and TCR in Response to UV and H , ; 0 , Cell surface molecules also appear to be important in the UV responses of non-lymphoid cells .
Our results demonstrate that the EGF receptor shows a substantial response within 30 s to UV , indicating a much more rapid response than the responses at 30 min to 1 h reported previously ( 44 , 45 ) .
The rapid UV response of growth factor receptors such as the EGF receptor might potentially contribute to the UV-induced activation of Sre reported to occur at 5 min following irradiation of Hela cells ( 2 ) , since receptor tyrosine kinases can activate Src ( 66 ) .
The mechanism by which UV acts on surface receptors such as the TCR or the EGF receptor is not known .
An important area for further research will be whether UV effects on cell mem-branes , such as lipid peroxidation ( 13 ) , might lead to receptor dimerization and signaling .
An important biological consequence of UV irradiation is the induction of a specific set of genes known as the mammalian UV response ( 88 , 39 , 67 ) .
The mammalian UV response can also be induced by other agents which damage DNA , such as ionizing radiation or H,0 , ( 39 , 67 ) .
One of the major transcription factors involved in this response is NF- « B ( 40 ) , which can be activated by H,0 , , UV , or ionizing radiation ( 68 ) .
The activation of NF- « B by H , O , or ionizing radiation in lymphocytes has previously been shown to be dependent on tyrosine kinase activity ( 36 ) .
The activation of NF- « B by UV in Hela cells has been shown to require a pathway involving Sre and Ras ( 5 ) .
In this study , we have shown that modulation of CD3 , which inhibits the UV induction of Ca** signals and cellular tyrosine phosphorylation , also inhibits the UV induction of NF- « B .
Thus , the surface expression of a receptor linked to tyrosine kinases appears to play an important role in the triggering of the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway by UV leading to NF- « B activation .
It has been proposed that the mammalian UV response has two components , one a response to oxidative stress and the other a response to DNA damage ( 2 ) .
The component responsive to oxidative stress involves a pattern of gene expression that extensively overlaps with the response to growth factor stimulation ( 69 ) .
UV activation of receptor-medi-ated signals , as suggested by our results , would provide a potential mechanism for a pattern of UV-induced gene expression similar to that induced by authentic ligands for such receptors .
Our results , taken together with earlier studies on UV sig-naling , suggest that in general UV-induced signal transduction appears to be mediated by cell surface receptors that either have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity such as the EGF recep-tor , or which are associated with tyrosine kinases , such as the TCR associated with ZAP-70 .
Events at the cell surface as well as the nucleus are therefore important in cellular responses to radiation .
Investigation of events occurring at the cell surface , as well as at the nucleus , appears to be integral to a complete understanding of biological responses to radiation and oxidative stress .
