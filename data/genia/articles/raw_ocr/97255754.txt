W. ] Abstract We evaluated the expression and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B subunits in human peripheral blood monocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) .
Constitutive DNA binding activity consisting of p50 homodimers was detected in nuclear extracts from both cell types .
An additional complex composed of p50/RelA ( p65 ) heterodimers appeared only in nuclear extracts from 7-day MDMs .
Immunoblot analysis showed that the p50 subunit was constitutively expressed in monocytes and MDMs .
In contrast , the RelA ( p65 ) subunit was barely detectable in monocytes , but its level increased markedly in MDMs .
Analysis of RelA ( p65 ) mRNA revealed that the stability of RelA ( p65 ) mRNA was significantly higher in MDMs , compared with monocytes .
In MDMs , an up-regulation of IxBa synthesis as well as the appearance of a novel M , 40,000 form of I « Ba were also observed .
These results suggest that macrophage differentiation results in the expression of active p50/RelA ( p65 ) heterodimers with the capacity to activate target gene expression .
The parallel induction of IkBa synthesis may allow for the continuous presence of a cytoplasmic reservoir of p50/RelA ( p65 ) complexes that are readily available for inducer-mediated stimulation .

regulation of immune functions including cytokines , cell surface immunoreceptors , adhesion molecules , and acute phase proteins ( 1 , 2 ) .
Several viral enhancers also contain NF- « B recognition sites in their promoter elements and use this host-regulatory pathway to selectively activate viral gene expression ( 1 , 2 ) .
The NF- « B/Re !
family includes several members : p50 ( NF- « B1 ) and its precursor p105 , p52 ( NF-B2 ) and its precursor p100 ( also called lyt-10 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , c-Rel ( p85 ) , and ReIB ( 3 ) .
Recently , an alternatively spliced form of RelA , termed A RelA ( p6S5A ) was also identified ( 3 ) .
All DNA-binding subunits [ p50 , p52 , RelA ( p65 ) , c-Rel , and RelB ] exhibit extensive homology in the NH ; -terminal 300 amino acids , a region that contains DNA binding , dimerization , and nuclear localization domains of the protein ( 4 ) .
In addition , RelA ( p65 ) and c-Rel also contain a strong transcriptional activation region in the COOH-terminal domain of the protein ( 5 ) .
The activity of NF- « B/Rel proteins is finely controlled at multiple regulatory levels including intracellular localization , posttranslational processing , splicing , and transcription ( 6 ) .
NF- « B heterodimers are generally retained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm through their interaction with a group of inhibitory molecules , the IkBs ( 7 ) .
Several forms of IB , including IxBa/MAD-3 ( and its avian homologue , pp40 ) , IkBB , bel-3 , and IkBy , as well as the p105 precursor , have now been described ( 7 ) .
Among these IB family members , IkBa is best characterized ( 8 , 9 ) and has been shown to interact with high affinity with RelA ( p65 ) and c-Rel and to inhibit p50/RelA ( p65 ) and p52/ReIA ( p65 ) heterodimers , Re-IA ( p65 ) homodimers , and NF- « B dimers that contain c-Rel ( 7 , 10 ) .
In many cell types , specific signals such as cytokines , phorbol esters , virus infection , and mitogens induce the release of IxBa from NF- « B , therefore permitting transport of DNA-binding NF- « B dimers to the nucleus ( 7 , 11 , 12 ) .
Phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa are the necessary steps required for dissociation of the heterotrimeric form of NF- « B ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) .
Furthermore , the activation of NF-kB DNA binding activity stimulates the de novo synthesis of IxBa because the promoter of IkxBa contains NF-kB sites and is highly responsive to NF- « B induction ( 15-18 ) .
Therefore , an auto-regulatory loop is established that ultimately permits the restoration of latent NF- « B/I « Ba complexes in the cytoplasm ( 15-18 ) .
Notably , disruption of the NF- « B/IkBa autoregula-tory loop by overexpression of I « Ba antisense RNA results in malignant transformation , suggesting that IxBa may represent a potential growth-suppressor activity ( 19 ) .
NF-kB binding activity is regulated during B-cell differentiation ( 20 ) .
In pre-B cells , NF- « B complexes are maintained in an inactive form in the cytosol , whereas NF- « B activity is constitutively expressed at high levels in the nucleus of mature B cells .
During the pre-B cell to B-cell transition , mod 436 - NF- « B Expression in Differentiating Monocytes Table 1 - Evaluation of the expression of differentiation markers on monocytes after different times of in vitro culture Values are expressed as specific com and are the mean of duplicate samples .

A ( p65 ) heterodimers in differentiating B cells to mainly p50/c-Rel heterodimers in mature B cells ( 20 ) .
Constitutive NF- « B/Rel binding activity has been demonstrated in mature macrophages ( 21-24 ) , whereas other studies have shown that NF- « B binding activity can be induced during differentiation of monocytic cell lines stimulated by PMA ( 21 , 25-28 ) .
However , no information is yet available on the pattern of NF- « B subunits expression during the spontaneous differentiation of primary monocytes to macrophages in vitro .
Culturing of freshly isolated human monocytes results in a time-dependent maturation to macrophages characterized by an increased expression of specific surface markers ( e.g. , CD11/CD18 , CD14 , transferrin receptor , ICAM-1 , and HLA-DR ; Refs .
29-31 ) as well as by an enhanced expression of some cytokines ( e.g. , TNF-a , IL-6 , and IFN- ) in response to LPS ( 31 ) .
Interestingly , most of these genes ( CD11/CD18 , ICAM-1 , HLA-DR , TNF-a , IL-6 , and IFN- $ B ) that play important roles in macrophage-mediated immune regulation share « B-like sequences in their promoters ( 1 ) .
In this study , we have characterized the nature of NF- « B complexes in human monocytes during in vitro differentiation .
We report here that the appearance of the strong trans-activating subunit RelA ( p65 ) in the nucleus is associated with the acquisition of a fully differentiated macrophage phenotype .
The expression of the RelA ( p65 ) subunit is , at least in part , posttranscriptionally regulated .
We also show that macrophage differentiation is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the level of IkBa , which may generate a reservoir of NF- « B complexes that can be readily activated in response to inducer-mediated stimuli .
Results Evaluation of the Expression of Differentiation Markers on Cultured Monocytes .
The expression of surface antigens was determined after 1 , 3 , and 7 days of in vitro culture .
Table 1 illustrates the results of representative experiments evaluating the expression of the transferrin receptor ( TTR ) , CD14 , and CD11b antigens .
A significant increase in the expression of these macrophage-associated antigens was observed consistently after 3-7 days of culture , indicating a well-defined , time-dependent differentiation of monocytes to macrophages .

- Mobility shift analysis of NF- « B binding proteins in 1-day cultured monocytes ( Lanes 1 and 3 ) and 7-day MDMs ( Lanes 4-6 ) .
Nuclear extracts ( 6 ug ) were analyzed for NF-kB binding activity by using the HIV enhancer oligonucleotide ( 0.2 ng ) as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
The protein-DNA complexes present in the extracts were competed using a 200-fold excess of either wild-type ( wt ; Lanes 2 and 5 ) or mutant { mut ) unlabeled oligonucleotide ( Lanes 3 and 6 ) .
Arrows , position of the retarded bands .
binding properties of NF- « B complexes occurred in monocytes during the course of their in vitro differentiation to macrophages , gel retardation assays were carried out with nuclear extracts from monocytes at different stages of differentiation .
As shown in Fig .
1 , a constitutive NF-kB binding activity was present in both monocytes and macrophages { Fig .
1 , complex A , Lanes 1 and 4 ) .
In nuclear extracts from 7-day cultured monocytes , we observed the appearance of an additional complex incompletely separated from complex A .
This additional complex had a lower electrophoretic mobility ( Fig .
1 , complex B , Lane 4 ) .
An excess of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide was capable of competing efficiently for the formation of these complexes , whereas a mutated kB oligonucleotide was unable to block NF-kB binding activity ( Fig .
1 , Lanes 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) , thereby confirming the specificity of both complexes .
Virtually identical results were obtained using 1- and 7-day monocyte/macro-phage cultures from five different donors .
The appearance of complex B was already observed after 3 days of in vitro culture of monocytes/macrophages ( data not shown ) .
Characterization of NF- « B Subunits Participating in the Formation of NF- « B Complexes .
Polyclonal antisera specific for unique sequences of NF- « B subunits were used to identify the NF-kB proteins participating in the formation of complexes A and B.

2. identification of NF-kB DNA binding subunits .
Nuclear extracts from 1-day cultured monocytes ( 4 ) and 7-day cultured macrophages ( B ) were preincubated with NF- « B-specific antisera ( 1:20 dilution ; Lanes 2-9 ) for 30 min and then allowed to interact with a P-labeled probe , as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Antisera specific for NF-kB p50 ( p50 ) , RelA ( p65 ) ( RelA ) , c-Rel ( c-re/ ) , and lyt-10 ( yt10 ) were used ( 48 ) .
The specificity of the antibody-protein complex was confirmed by the addition of excess peptide as a competitor { fames 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ) .
NF- « B2 ( p100/p52 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , and c-Rel subunits were preincubated with nuclear extracts prior to the addition of the labeled oligodeoxynucleotide .
As shown in Fig .
24 , Lane 2 , preincubation with the NH ; terminal-reactive anti-p105/p50 resulted in the shift of complex A .

Western blot analysis of p50 and RelA ( p65 ) NF- « B subunits .
Cell extracts ( 15 ug ) from monocytes cultured for 1 , 2 , 3 , or 7 days were diluted 1:2 in 2x SDS buffer , boiled 10 min , loaded on 12.5 % SDS-PAGE , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
The nitrocellulose was then incubated with either anti-RelA ( p65 ) ( 4 ) or anti-p50 antibodies ( B ; 1:1000 dilution ) .
Membranes were further processed as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
( Fig .
24 , Lane 3 ) .
In contrast , no shifted bands were obtained after preincubation of the extracts with antibodies to Re-IA ( p65 ) , c-Rel , or lyt-10 ( Fig .
24 , Lanes 4-10 ) .
Similar results were obtained by using WCEs ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
2B , preincubation of extracts from 7-day MDMs with antibodies to p50 and RelA ( p65 ) resulted in a shift of both complexes A and B ( Fig .
2B , Lane 2 ) .
In contrast , antibodies to RelA ( p65 ) were capable of efficiently shifting complex B but not complex A ( Fig .
2B , Lane 4 ) .
Antibodies to c-Rel and lyt-10 were completely ineffective ( Fig .
2B , Lanes 6-9 ) .
The appearance of the shifted complex was completely inhibited in the presence of a RelA ( p65 ) -specific peptide ( Fig .
2B , Lane 5 ) .
These results suggest that the formation of complex B in mature macrophages is due to the appearance of RelA ( p65 ) binding activity in the nucleus .
Synthesis of RelA ( p65 ) Protein during Differentiation of Monocytes to Macrophages .
To further investigate whether the appearance of complex B in differentiated macrophages was the result of de novo expression of Re-IA ( p65 ) protein , Western blot analysis was performed with WCEs from monocytes at different stages of differentiation .
Interestingly , RelA ( p65 ) was not detected in monocytes cultured for 1 and 2 days ( Fig .
34 ) .
A slight expression of RelA ( p65 ) protein was observed in extracts from 3-day monocytes , but maximal expression was observed in 7-day MDMs ( Fig .
34 ) .
Similar results were obtained in five separate experiments performed with WCEs from different donors .
in contrast , p50 protein was constitutively synthesized in 1-day monocytes , and its expression did not vary during in vitro culture ( Fig .
3B ) .
Consistent with this result , the level of NF- « B1 p105 did not vary throughout monocyte-to-mac-rophage differentiation ( data not shown ) .

Western blot analysis of IxB- « .
Western blot analysis was carried out as described in the legend to Fig .
3 and in `` Materials and Methods '' by using a 1:1000 dilution of an antibody specific for the NH-terminal region of IxB-a protein .
The specificity of the antibody-protein interaction was confirmed by the addition of excess specific peptide ( 5 ug ) as a competitor ( + ) .
of the inhibitory molecule IkBa , Western blot analysis was performed by using an antibody specific to the IkBa NH ; -terminal domain .
As shown in Fig .
4 , two different bands of approximately M , 37,000 and M , 40,000 were resolved by this antibody .
Interestingly , both bands disappeared when the antiserum was first preincubated with the peptide against which it was raised , thereby demonstrating that they both represented specific IxBa species .
Both bands were expressed at low levels in freshly isolated monocytes .
A time-dependent enhancement of IxBa expression was observed during monocytic differentiation , and notably , the induction of the M , 37,000 I « Ba form occurred more rapidly .
Stimulation of cells with a variety of NF- « B inducers leads to phosphorylation and rapid loss of IkBa ( 32 ) .
In particular , a new slowly migrating form of IkBa has been observed immediately after treatment of U937 cells with different stimuli ( 18 , 32 ) .
According to these observations , stimulation of MDMs with TNF-a and LPS resulted in the appearance of a phosphorylated band just above the M , 37,000 form ( Fig .
5A , Lanes 1 and 2 ) .
To investigate whether the slowly migrating IkBa form observed in monocytes/macrophages could be a hyperphosphorylated form , WCEs from 7-day MDMs were treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase prior to Western blot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
5B ( Lane 2 ) , phosphatase treatment did not affect the expression of the high molecular weight form ( M , 40,000 ) of IkBa .
In contrast , phosphatase treatment resulted in the complete disappearance of the phosphorylated band induced in TNF- « - and LPS-treated cells ( data not shown ) .
Similar results were also obtained when calf intestinal phosphatase was used ( data not shown ) , thereby indicating that the novel M , 40,000 form detected in monocyte extracts was not a serine-phosphorylated form of IkBa .
To further investigate whether the two IkBa components could undergo degradation following appropriate stimula-tion , experiments in the presence of calpain inhibitor I were carried out .
As shown in Fig .
5C , Lane 2 , treatment of 7-day MDMs with the combination of cycloheximide and TNF-a rapidly induced degradation of both M , 37,000 and M , 40,000 forms .
Although the degradation of the M , 37,000 band occurred to a lower extent compared to the M , 40,000 form , the degradation of both bands was markedly inhibited by the addition of protease inhibitor ( Fig .

Effect of Macrophage Differentiation on the Expression of RelA ( p65 ) mRNA .
To establish whether the lack of RelA ( p65 ) synthesis in 1-day monocytes could be because of a reduced expression of the RelA¥A ( p65 ) mRNA , we carried out RT-PCR analysis on RNA samples that were extracted from monocytes cultured for 1 or 7 days .
As shown in Fig .
6 , RelA ( p65 ) mRNA accumulated at comparable levels in both cell types .
However , to better evaluate the effect of macrophage differentiation on the expression of RelA ( p65 ) mRNA , we also measured the relative stability of this mRNA .
Ac-cordingly , total RNA was prepared from 1-day monocytes and 7-day cultured macrophages at different times after the addition of actinomycin D. The rate of RelA { ( p65 ) mRNA decay was then determined by RT-PCR during the following 6 h. The GAPDH mRNA was used as a control because its Cell Growth & Differentiation 100 S & E jad & 10 J .

RNA ( 1 ug ) was retrotranscribed and amplified as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Autoradiographs were scanned for RelA ( p65 ) and GAPDH cDNA .
The RelA ( p65 ) values were normalized against the GAPDH values .
RelA ( p65 ) values were expressed as percentages , with the 100 % value assigned to the level present at time 0 , before the addition of actinomycin D. The values given ( fop pane ! )
are the mean of three separate experiments .
Bottom panel , the results of one representative experiment .
Rel A stability was not modified by actinomycin D during the time of treatment .
As shown in Fig .
6 , a significant increase in the half-life of RelA ( p65 ) mRNA was observed in 7-day MDMs ( t/ ~ 2.5 h ) as compared with that of 1-day monocytes ( 1 % ~ 30 min ) .
In contrast , the stability of the p50 and IkBa mRNAs was unchanged during macrophage differentiation ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that the lack of RelA ( p65 ) protein expression in 1-day monocytes may be because of , at least in part , the more rapid turnover of its mRNA , whereas the accumulation of the RelA ( p65 ) protein in 7-day MDMs may reflect a reduced degradation rate of the corresponding mRNA .
Discussion Previous studies performed using monocytic tumor cell lines have demonstrated that macrophage differentiation is associated with a modulation in the NF- « B binding activity ( 21 , 25-28 ) .
In particular , Griffin et a/ .
( 21 ) showed that NF- « B binding activity appeared during the transition from promonocyte to monocyte in U937 cells induced to differentiate in vitro by PMA and that NF- « B-dependent transcription was specifically enhanced .
The pattern of expression of the « B binding proteins has been subsequently explored in more detail by Kaufman et a/ .
( 27 ) in human monocytic cell lines .
These authors found a constitutive expression of p50 in the nuclei of both unstimulated U937 and THP-1 cells , whereas a constitutive RelA ( p65 ) expression was only found in THP-1 cells .
Treatment of both cell lines with TNF-a lead to the induction of p50 and RelA ( p65 ) proteins .
These authors concluded that the different pattern of NF- « B subunits expression in these monocytic cells was dependent on cellular differentiation ( 27 ) .
The relationships among HIV infection of myeloid cells , induction of NF-kB binding activity , cellular differentiation , and HIV-1 gene expression have also been examined .
In particular , Roulston et a/ .
( 26 , 28 ) reported that a dramatic alteration in protein-DNA interactions occurring at the NF- « B recognition site took place during myeloid differentiation , concomitant with HIV-1 infection .
However , a detailed characterization of NF-kB subunits during the differentiation of primary monocytes to macrophages has not yet been reported .
Peripheral blood monocytes mature in different types of tissue histiocytes when they migrate from the bloodstream to various tissues .
This differentiation is essential for their functional competence and is probably triggered by environmental signals .
/n vitro cultivation of blood monocytes results in their adherence to the plastic surface and in the initiation of a series of characteristic changes that closely resemble those occurring during their in vivo maturation to macrophages ( 29-31 ) .
Therefore , in vitro cultured MDMs represent a unique cell model to investigate the expression of NF- « B factors during macrophage differentiation .
In this study , we have described qualitative changes in the expression of NF-kB subunits during the differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages .
Although constitutive NF- « B binding activity was detected in nuclear extracts from both 1-day cultured monocytes and 7-day MDMs , an additional complex appeared in nuclear extracts from 7-day MDMs .
This complex , designated complex B , was characterized by a slower electrophoretic mobility as compared with the constitutively expressed complex A ( Fig .
1 ) .
Super-shift assays performed with antibodies specific for the p50 and RelA ( p65 ) proteins showed that complex A was composed of p50/p50 homodimers , whereas heterodimers pS50/ RelA ( p65 ) participated to the formation of complex B ( Fig .
2 ) .
Our results agree with those of other authors ( 21-24 ) , who also detected a constitutive NF- « B binding activity in unstimulated primary monocytes .
In contrast , Suzan et al .
( 25 ) failed to detect such binding activity in primary monocytes .
This discrepancy may be due to differences in the method used to prepare the monocytes/macrophages and/or in the source of peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
Western blot 440 - NF- « B Expression in Differentiating Monocytes ting analysis showed that the absence of RelA ( p65 ) activity in 1-day monocytes could be explained by a lack of RelA ( p65 ) protein .
In fact , RelA¥A ( p65 ) expression was demonstrated only in cell extracts derived from MDMs cultured in vitro for at least 3 days ( Fig .
34 ) .
In contrast with our results , Lofquist et al .
( 23 ) reported the presence of low levels of p5O/ReIA ( p6S5 ) complexes in the nuclei of unstimulated monocytes .
A difference in the monocyte isolation procedure , the possible presence of contaminant LPS , and the timing of cell processing after isolation from the peripheral blood may account for this discrepancy .
Franzoso et al .
( 33 ) reported recently the existence of a novel , faster-migrating NF- « B complex , characterized by a specific truncation of the COOH-terminal of the RelA ( p65 ) subunit .
This specific truncation removes the RelA ( p65 ) transactivation function but not the DNA binding or dimer-ization functions .
The appearance of this novel RelA ( p65 ) form was correlated with the activity of specific serine pro-teases , termed serprocidins , that are dramatically down-regulated by macrophage differentiating agents .
Using an antibody specific to the domain of RelA ( p65 ) and the protease inhibitors used by Franzoso et al .
( 33 ) , we failed to detect this truncated form of RelA ( p65 ) in both monocytes and 7-day cultured macrophages ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , the finding that RelA ( p65 ) can be induced in 1-day monocytes after a 30-min treatment with PMA further indicates that the lack of expression of RelA ( p65 ) in freshly harvested cells is not due to protein degradation during the extraction procedures ( data not shown ) .
Induction of RelA ( p65 ) expression is correlated in part with increased stabilization of RelA ( p65 ) mRNA ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , the p50 subunit ( Fig .
3B ) and its precursor p105 ( data not shown ) were expressed constitutively in freshly isolated monocytes , and their level did not change during the differentiation from monocytes to macrophages .
A direct correlation was found between the expression of RelA ( p65 ) subunit ( Fig .
34 ) and IkBa synthesis ( Fig .
4 ) in MDMs .
In this regard , it was reported recently that the transcription of IxBa mRNA was rapidly induced by nuclear NF- « B complexes on treatment with PMA or LPS ( 15-18 ) .
The induction of I « Ba is directly mediated by the NF- « B site present in the upstream promoter element of the /xBa gene ( 15-18 ) .
IxBa is further regulated posttranscriptionally , because the stability of the IxBa protein is greatly reduced on activation of NF-kB activity .
The IkBa protein is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to stimulation in many cell lines ( 7 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 34-38 ) .
The removal of I « kB is coupled to a concomitant translocation of NF- « B from the cytoplasm into the nucleus .
In particular , recent studies ( 18 , 32 ) reported the appearance of a new transient species of IkBa in U937 cells ( soon after stimulation with TNF-a ) , which represented a phosphorylated IxkBa form .
We report here the presence of two different IkBa species in extracts of monocytes/macrophages that increased during differentiation .
However , treatment of these extracts with two different phosphatases failed to remove the upper band , indicating that this IxBa component was not a serine-phosphorylated form .
In this regard , an alternative mechanism of NF- « B activation involving tyrosine phospho- rylation of IkBa has been reported recently ( 39 ) .
in light of this observation , additional studies are required to establish whether the M , 40,000 band could be a tyrosine-phospho-rylated form of IkBa .
The pattern of phosphorylation and degradation of the M , 37,000 form in response to different stimuli occurred as described in other cell models , although with delayed kinet-ics ( Fig .
5A ) .
In addition , the stabilization of the two forms in the presence of calpain inhibitor | further indicates that both forms are regulated by phosphorylation in response to specific stimuli .
The expression of another member of the I « B family , IkBB , was also found to be up-regulated during monocyte differentiation ( data not shown ) .
Sequence analysis identified the NF-kB sequence in a large number of gene-regulatory elements , including those involved in the expression of several cytokines and adhesion molecules .
Some of these genes are known to be specifically regulated during cell differentiation ( 30 , 31 , 40 , 41 ) .
Notably , NF-KB is also a strong transactivator of HIV~1 transcription , particularly in mononuclear phagocytic cells ( 21 , 42 , 43 ) .
In this regard , monocytes and macrophages differ in their ability to support HIV replication and to produce some cytokines ( TNF-a and IL-6 ) , which in turn can potentiate HIV-1 replication ( 31 , 44 , 45 ) .
We suggest that the appearance of the strong trans-activating subunit RelA ( p65 ) in the nucleus may play a role in the activation of virus expression in HIV-in-fected macrophages and may have biological relevance for the acquisition of a fully differentiated macrophage phenotype .
Materials and Methods Isolation and Culture of Monocytes .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 18-40-year-old healthy donors and separated by using Ficoll-Paque solution ( Pharmacia Biotech , Inc. , Uppsala , Swe-den ) as described previously ( 31 ) .
Monocytes were separated from lym-phocytes by adherence ( 1 h at 37°C ) to plastic dishes .
After removal of nonadherent cells , monocytes were extensively washed and cultured in Iscove 's medium containing 15 % FCS ( 0.22 wm filtered ) in 5 % CO , ; in air at 37°C .
At various culture times ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 7 days ) , both adherent and nonadherent cells were recovered and analyzed .
We refer to 1-day monocytes as those cells that have been processed 24 h after cell seeding when adherence-activated phenomena have reverted completely to basal levels .
Cytochemical ( sodium fluoride-inhibited esterase activity ) and surface marker ( CD14 antigen ) analysis revealed that the adherent cell population consisted of 95 % monocytes .
All of the reagents used for monocyte isolation and culture were endotoxin free , as evaluated by the Lymulus amebocyte lysate assay .
Radiobinding Assay .
Five x 10° monocytes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against TfR ( OKT9 ; Ortho Diagnostic Systems , Inc. ) , CD14 ( LeuM3 ; Becton Dickinson ) , or CD11b ( OKM1 ; Ortho Diagnostic Systems , Inc. ) , as described previously ( 31 ) .
This assay was performed routinely to check the extent of macrophage differentiation in all of the experiments .
Nuclear and WCE Preparation .
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described previously ( 46 ) .
Briefly , monocytes were detached from the tissue culture dish by using a rubber scraper in cold PBS and washed twice before being resuspended in lysis buffer A ( 46 ) .
After cen-trifugation , the nuclear peliet was suspended in buffer C ( 46 ) , incubated 15 min on ice , and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was then diluted 1:5 with buffer D ( 46 ) and stored at -80°C .
WCEs were prepared as described previously ( 47 ) with the exception that pepstatin , aprotinin , and leupeptin were used at the concentration of 10 ug/ml .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay .
Nuclear extracts ( 6 ug ) or WCEs ( 10 ug ) were preincubated with 5 ug of the nonspecific DNA competitor poly ( deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic ) acid ( Pharmacia ) for 10 min Cell Growth & Differentiation at room temperature in 20 pl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 70 mm KCI , 10 % glycerol , 1 mm EDTA , and 1 mm DTT .
Binding activity was assessed by incubating the extract with 0.2 ng of °°P end-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the enhancer region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( 5'-AGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGACTTTCC-3 ' ) for 30 min at room temperature .
Protein-DNA complexes were then separated on a 5 % native polyacrylamide gel ( 60:1 cross-link ) in Tris-glycine [ 25 mm Tris , 195 mm glycine ( pH 8.5 ) ] .
In competition analysis , a 200 molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or of a mutant 5'-ACATGGTTTC-CGCTCATGGTTTCC-3 !
was incubated with the extract for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the probe .
To examine the individual proteins present in the complexes , polyclonal subunit rabbit antisera ( 48 ) , specific for p50/p105 ( AR27 , NH , -terminal specific ) , RelA { p65 ) ( AR28 , COOH-terminal specific ) , c-Rel ( AR22 , COOH-terminal specific ) , and p52/p100 ( AR43 , NH ; -terminal specific ) were incubated ( 1:20 ) with the nuclear extract in the presence or absence of the specific competitor peptide ( 1 ug ) for 20 min at room temperature before the binding reaction .
Western Blot Analysis of NF- « B Subunits .
WCEs ( 15 ug ) were resolved by SDS/PAGE , electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher and Schuell , and incubated with rabbit antisera specific for p50/p105 , RelA ( p65 ) , or for IxBa ( AR20 , NH , -terminal specific ) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 5 % mill/PBS overnight at room temperature .
After four washes with PBS for 10 min , membranes were reacted with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin serum ( Amersham Corp. ) and visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham ) .
For phosphatase treatment experiments , WCEs from 7-day MDMs ( 15 pg ) were incubated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase ( 4 units ) for 1 h at 37°C in the presence or in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors 10 mm and NaF 50 mm ) and then were subject to Western blot analysis .
For calpain inhibitor experiments , 7-day MDMs were incubated for 1 h with 100 um calpain inhibitor I ( Calbiochem ) and then treated for 30 min with cycloheximide ( 50 ug/mi ) and TNF-a ( 10 ng/ml ) .
RT-PCR Analysis of NF- « B Subunit mRNA .
Total cellular RNA prepared was reverse transcribed and subsequently amplified as described previously ( 49 ) .
The cycler program consisted of an initial denaturation of 3 min at 95°C , followed by 22 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C , primer annealing for 2 min at 58°C , and extension for 3 min at 72°C .
A negative control-lacking template RNA or RT was included in each experiment .
The PCR products were run on an agarose gel , transferred to a nylon membrane , and hybridized to specific labeled DNA probes , as described previously ( 49 ) .
The sequence for the GAPDH and RelA ( p65 ) primers have been described ( 49 , 50 ) .
The DNA probes recognize sequences internal to the amplification products .
Their sequences are : GAPDH , CTAAGCATGTGGTGGTGCA ; and RelA ( p6§5 ) , GCATGCGCTTC-CGCTACAAGTGCG .
The low number of PCR cycles , followed by the Southern blot of the PCR products , ensures a measurement of mRNA concentrations within a linear range .
Analysis of mRNA Half-Life , Monocytes cultured for 1 or 7 days were treated with 10 g/m !
of actinomycin D ( Sigma ) .
Total RNA was extracted after 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 h as described above .
Autoradiographs exposed for different times were scanned in a densitometer ( UitroScan XL ; Pharma-cia ) .
This ensured that the values obtained were in the linear range of response of densitometry .
