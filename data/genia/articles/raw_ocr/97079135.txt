Summary Rheumatoid arthritis is a multistep disorder associated with autoimmune features of yet unknown ctiology .
Implication of viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis has been suspected on the basis of several indirect observations , but thus far , a direct link between EBV and rheumatoid arthritis has not been provided .
Here we show that a large fraction of T cells infiltrating affected joints from a patient with chronic rheumatoid arthritis recognizes two EBV transactivators ( BZLF1 and BMLF1 ) in a major histocompatibility complex-restricted fashion .
Responses to these EBV antigens by synovial lymphocytes from several other chronic rheumatoid arthritis patients were readily detectable .
Thus these results suggest a direct contribution of EBV to chronic rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis .
They also demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of T cell responses against EBV transactivating factors , which might be central in the control of virus reactivation .
heumatoid arthritis ( RA ) !
is an incapacitating disease characterized by chronic joint inflammation and progressive destruction of articular structures , which affects about 1 % of the population worldwide ( 1 ) .
Its etiology remains unresolved , but there is ample evidence that T cells contribute directly to RA pathogenesis .
This is supported in particular by ( a ) the widespread T cell infiltration of affected synovial membranes from RA patients ( 2 ) , ( b ) the genetic predisposition of RA , which is associated with certain MHC class H haplotypes ( 3-7 ) , and ( 0 ) the beneficial effects of T cell-depleting treatments in RA patients ( 8 , 9 ) .
Despite this , the specificity of T cells infiltrating RA lesions and their pathogenicity at late stages of the disease remain obscure .
With respect to the first issue , several candidate antigens recognized by synovial T cells have been pro-posed .
For instance , a pathogenic role of T cell-mediated immune responses against connective tissue proteins such as type II collagen 1s supported by the occurrence of increased proliferative responses to these Ag of synovial T cells as compared to PBL in RA patients ( 10 , 11 ) .
Besides endogenous compounds , several arthritogenic Ag of mycobacterial Abbreviations used in this paper : BLC , B lymphoblastoid cells ; RA , theu-matord arthritis ; SFL , synovial fluid lymphocytes ; SML , synovial membrane-derived lymphocytes .
origin , such as stress proteins , have been shown to elicit synovial T cell responses in some RA patients , although the importance of stress proteins in synovial T cell-mediated responses against mycobacteria still remains controversial { 12-15 } .
Furthermore , a variety of viruses have been proposed as RA causative agents ( 1 ) .
In particular , EBV has long been linked to RA on theoretical grounds ( e.g. , because of the existence of shared epitopes between EBV proteins and RA autoantigens ) and from clinical studies suggesting in particular increased anti-EBV serological responses in a fraction of RA patients ( 16 , 17 ) .
However the physiopathological relevance of these observations is still unclear , particularly because no evidence for anti-EBV responses within RA lesions have been provided thus far .
The pathogenicity of T cells at late stages of RA is also a controversial issue .
On the one hand , both the extensive diversity of the TCRs expressed by synovial lymphocytes isolated from most chronic RA patients ( 18 ) and the evidence for joint destruction and/or active synovitis in the absence of local lymphoid infiltrate in animal models and in humans ( 19 ) argues against a major role of T cells in the perpetuation of RA .
On the other hand , a specific Ag-driven 'T cell recruitement to the joints at late stages of RA is indirectly supported by studies demonstrating oligoclonal T cell expansions within the affected joints of several chronic RA patients ( 18 ) .

In an attempt to evaluate the repertoire diversity and specificity of T cells activated during chronic RA , we recently studied the specificity of synovial T lymphocytes derived from patients with typical long lasting chronic RA .
Because in several patients the majority of synovial T cells were CD8 # , both €CD4* cells , which presumably comprise T cells reactive against RA susceptibility HLA class II alleles , and CDS* cells were analyzed .
CD4* and/or CD8~ synovial T cell responses towards autologous and/or allogeneic B lymphoblastoid cells ( BLC ) expressing one or several autologous HLA alleles were detected in four of six patients studied ( David-Ameline , J. , M.A .
Peyrat , and M. Bonneville , unpublished results ) , Furthermore , in two patients , an enrichment for autologous BLC-reactive cells among synovial T cells was evidenced by comparative analyses of pa-tients '' PBL and synovial T cells ( 20 ; results summarized in Table 1 } .
Together , these results suggested frequent expansions of cells reactive against autologous BLC during chronic RA .
Here we make use of this material to characterize by 1792 an expression cloning approach the antigens recognized by synovial T cells derived from these patients .
A dominant response of synovial T cells to twa EBV transactivators is dem-onstrated , thus suggesting an Ag-driven recruitment of T cells to the synovium in these patients and a possible role of these EBV-specific T cells in chronic RA pathogenesis .
More generally , this study provides the first clear-cut evidence for T cell responses against EBV proteins playing a key function during virus replication .
Such responses might have a central role in the control of virus spreading under physiological and pathological situations .
Materials and Methods Patients Patient 1 ( HLA-A*0201/02 , -B*2705/4002 , -Cw*0102/15 , DRB1 '' *0i01/0401 , DGQB1*0301/0501 ) had a typical erosive RA lasting for 6 yr at the time of the first sample collection .
He fulfilled six of seven critema for RA defined by Arnett et al .
( 21 ) .
Ant-EBV T Cell Responses in Rheumatord Arthritis Polyarthritis remained active durning the whole follow-up period .
This patient received low-dose predmsone { 7-12 mg/d ) through-out .
Synovial find lymphocytes ( SFL ) were obtained during synovial fluid analysis before steroid infiltrations .
Synovial membrane lymphocytes ( SML ) were obtained during surgery , performed 27 mo after collection of SFL .
All other patients fulfilled at least four out of seven critena for RA ( 21 ) .
Anti-EBV serology was studied in patients 1 , 5 , and 6 .
All had serum antibodies against at least one of the following EBV proteins : RA nuclear antigen , Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 , early antigens , and viral capsid antigens .
These patients showed dramatically elevated titers of serum antibodies against early antigens ( range 160 to > 640 ) .
Cells PBL and SFL were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % human serum , 1 mM 1-glutamine ( hereafter referred to as culture medium ) , and recombinant IL-2 { 100 T1U/ml ) .
T cell clones were isolated and restimulated once a month as follows .
Synovial T cells ( either total or sorted by means of TCR BV re-gron-specific mAb ) were seeded at 0.3 cells/well and cultured in culture medium supplemented with IL-2 { 100 TU/ml } , punfied PHA ( leucoagglutinin , 0.5 pg/ml ) and irradiated ( 30 Gy ) allogeneic feeder cells .
Such culture conditions allow the growth of virtually all T cells and do not introduce any bias in the T cell reper-toire , as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis using TCR BV region-specific mAb and by analysis of TCR CDR3 length distribution ( 22 ; Lin , A. , M.A .
Peyrat , and M. Bonneville , unpublished data ) .
Coreceptor phenotype , TCR features , and HLA restriction of T cell clones are detailed elsewhere ( 20 ) and summarized in Table 1 .
Expression Cloning of T Cell Antigens Construction of the cDNA Library .
- Poly ( A ) !
RNA was prepared from patient 1 BLC using an mRNA purification kit ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piscataway , NJ ) .
cDNAs were synthesized using a Zap-cDNA synthesis kit ( Stratagene Inc. , La Jolla , CA ) .
BstX1I adaptators { Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) were ligated to the cDNAs .
After size fractionation , cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 ( In-vitrogen ) digested with BstXI .
Recombinant plasmids were elec-troporated into Escherichia col Xl-1 and selected with ampicillin ( 50 pg/ml ) , The library was divided into 288 pools of 200 cDNA clones .
Each pool was amplified to saturation , and plasmid DNA was extracted by the alkaline lysis method .
Transfection of COS Cells , - Transfection was performed by the DEAE-dextran-chloroquine method as described ( 23 , 24 ) .
In brief , 1.5 X 10 % COS cells were transfected with 100 ng of plasmid containing the relevant HLA DNA and 100 ng of a pool of the cDNA library .
The genomic HLA-A*0101 , which was kindly provided by Dr. J. Girdlestone ( Medical Research Council , Cam-bridge , UK ) .
was cloned into pecDNA3 .
Genomic HLA-A*0201 DNA , HLA-A*2401 cDNA , and HLA-A*0301 were kindly provided by T. Boon ( Ludwig Institute , Brussels , Belgium ) .
HLA-A*O201 was cloned into pSV2 vector , HLA-A*2401 and A*0301 were in pcDNA3 .
The cDNA HLA-B*3501 , which was kindly provided by Dr. L. Satz ( Laboratory of Immunogenetics , Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin , Buenos Aires , Argentina ) , was cloned into peDNA3 .
HLA-B*4002 and Cw*0102 were cloned from the B cell cDNA library .
Transfectants were then tested for their ability to stimulate TNF production by T cells ( see below ) .
Each positive pool was subcloned into 800-1,600 bacteria , which were each tested for their ability to trigger T cell clone TNF release after expression in COS cells cotransfected with relevant 1793 Scotet et al .
HLA DNA .
Positive clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method .
T Cell Stimulation Assay .
T cells were added to COS cells 24-48 h after transfection , and culture supernatants were harvested 6-18 h later and tested for TNF content by measuring culture supernatant cytotoxicity to WEHMIt64 clone 13 in a color-metric assay ( 25 ) .
Production of Truncated BMLF1 or BZLF1 cDNA .
- Truncated BMLF1 cDNA fragments , generated by partial digests , were cloned into peDNA3 .
pecDNA3 vector was also used to clone a 140-bp fragment after PCR amplification of the ASacII BMLFi1 fragment with olgonucleotides BM1 ( 5-GCGGATCCGCCACCATG-3 ' ) , introducing a BamHI site for cloning and an internal ATG , and SP6 ( S'-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3 '' ) .
Truncated BZLFi cDNA fragments , generated by partial digests , were cloned into peDNA3 .
Peptide Assays Lyophilized peptides ( Chiron Mimotopes Corp. , Victoria , Australia ) were dissolved at 20 mg/ml in DMSO , diluted at 2 mg/ml in 10 mM acetic acid , and stored at -80°C .
In cytaotoxic-ity assays , 2.5 X 10 % `` Cr-labeled A2.10 T cells were incubated in the presence of peptides at various concéntrations , and `` Cr release was measured after 3 h at 37°C .
Percentage of specific lysis was calculated as described in ( 22 ) .
In TNF release assays , 2.5 X 10+ T cells were incubated for 5 h with the peptides at various concentrations , and the amount of TNF released in the supernatant was estimated by the WEHI 164 cytotoxicity assay .
T Cell Cytotoxicity and Proliferation Assays Both kinds of assays were performed as previously described ( 22 ) .
In brief , cytotoxic activity of T cell clones toward BLC was measured by a standard 4-h `` Cr-release assay at two E/T ratios .
T cell clone cytolytic potential was estimated by lectin-dependent killing of target cells ( i.e. , by evaluating T cell cytotoxic activity in the culture medium supplemented with 0.5 pg/ml of purified PHA [ Ieucoagglutinin ] ) .
Proliferative activity of responder T cells was estimated after a 48-h culture of 10+ responder cells with 2.5 X 104 irradiated BLC in 100 pl of culture medium supplemented with rIL-2 , followed by an overnight pulse with 0.5 pCi of triti-ated thymidine .
COS Transfection Assays Using Polyclonal T Cell Lines Patients ' PBL , SFL , or SML were cultured for 15 d in culture medium supplemented with rIL-2 and leucoagglutinin .
Under such culture condifions , no TCR repertoire skewings were intro-duced , as suggested by comparative analysis of TCR BV CDR3 length distribution of some synovial samples before and after culture ( Lim , A. , M.A .
Peyrat , and M. Bonneville , unpublished ob-servations } .
After washing , colls were maintained for 7 d in culture medium with rIl-2 but without lectin , to decrease spontaneous TNF release .
TNF secretion in culture supernatant was then estimated as described above , after incubating for 6 h varying numbers of responder T cells ( from 10° to 10° ) together with confluent COS cells transfected 24 h earlier with HLA and/or EBV cDNAs .

tologous BLC ( 20 ) .
The fact that autologous BLC-reactive clones were found in both CD4 !
and CD8* T cell subsets suggested that this reactivity was a general feature of synovial T cells , regardless of their coreceptor phenotype ( 20 ) .
In an attempt to establish the fine specificity of these cells , cDNAs from a patient 1 BLC library were screened for their ability to trigger TNF production by synovial T cell clones after transient cotransfection into COS cells together with DNAs encoding the appropriate MHC allele ( 23 , 24 ) .
Because this approach is well suited for cloning MHC class I- but not class HI-restricted Ags ( 23 ) , this analysis focused on the characterization of Ag recognized by CDB8~T synovial T cell clones .
Recognition of the EBV Transactivator BMLF1 by the Synovial T Cell Clore A2.10 .
A T cell clone from patient 1 , A2.10 , recognizing autologous BLC in an HLA-A*0201-restricted fashion ( Table 1 ) , was analyzed first .
Using the COS transfection approach ( 23 , 24 ) , we identified 2 out of 270 cDNA pools that induced TNF production by clone A2.10 after cotransfection with HLA-A¥*0201 DNA .
Out of 800 clones derived from one positive pool , one 1,591-bp cDNA induced TNF production by A2.10 cells when cotransfected with HLA-A*0201 DNA ( Fig .
1 A ) .
Its sequence was identical to that of an EBV gene , BMLF1 , encoding a 43 % 9-amino acid protein expressed during the early stage of the virus replicative cycle ( 26 , 27 ) .
Because of the transactivating properties of the BMLF1 product ( 26 ) , this protein could upregulate the expression of endogenous Ag recognized in turn by the synovial T cell clone rather than being 1794 recognized itself .
To address this question , truncated BMLF1 cDNAs were tested for their abslity to activate A2.10 TNF release after cotransfection with HLA-A*0201 DNA .
A BMLF ! 1 region encoded by a Hincll/Sacll 140-bp sequence was shown to be stimulatory ( Fig .
1 B ) .
Of several peptides located in this region and synthesized on the basis of their consensus binding capacities to HLA-A*0201 ( 28 ) , only the nonapeptide GLCTLVAML ( amino acids 259-267 ) induced autocytotoxicity and TNF release by A2.10 cells ( Fig .
1 , C and D ) .
This formally demonstrates a classic MHC-restricted recognition of the BMLF1 protein .
Recognition of the EBV Transactivator BZLF1 by the Synovial T Cell Clone A17.11 .
- The antigenic specificity of an-ather synovial T cell clone from patient 1 , A17.11 , which recognized autologous BLC in an HLA-Cw*O102-restricted fashion ( Table 1 ) , was then studied .
Because this clone did not react with COS cells cotransfected with BMLF1 and HLA-Cw*0102 cDNAs , the cloning strategy described above was applied once again ( 23 ) .
One cDNA , which conferred recognition of COS cells by A17.11 cells after cotransfection with HLA-Cw*0102 DNA ( Fig .
2 ) , contained a 753-bp cDNA insert encoding BZLF1 , another early EBV protein with transactivating properties ( 29 ) .
Dominant Response of Synovial T Cells from Patient 1 to EBV Transactivators .
- We then tested the reactivity toward BMLEF1- or BZLF1-transfected COS cells of the whole panel of BLC I-reactive CD8* synovial T cell clones with a known HLA restriction element ( A*0201 , B*4002 , or Cw '' *0102 ) and expressing distinct T cell receptors ( Table 1 ) .

- BZLFI recognition by the HLA-Cw*0102-restricted T cell clone A17.11 .
TNF released by T cell clone A17.11 was measured after incubation with COS cells transfected with BZLFI and HLA-Cw*0102 cDNA or with each of these cDNA .
The expenmental protocol 1s the same as described in the legend to Fig .
1 .
Whereas one other clone reacted with BZLFI in the context of HLA-Cw*0102 ( clone A17.10 , Table 2 ) , most T cell clones recognized BZLF1 in the context of HLA-B*4002 { representative data shown in Fig .
3 A and summarized in Table 2 ) .
The characterization of T cell clones recognizing BZLF1 in the context of HLA-B*4002 , for which peptide anchor motifs are well defined ( 28 ) , allowed us to determine whether , similarly to BMLF1 , this transactivator was recognized as a peptidic antigen presented by MHC prod-ucts .
In support of this , BZLF1 cDNA fragments able to trigger TNF production by T cell clone A14.7 after cotransfection with HLA-B*4002 DNA into COS cells could be defined ( Fig .
3 B ) , and a synthetic peptide located in the stimulatory BZLF1 region was shown to trigger T cell clone autocytotoxicity and TNF release ( Fig .
3 , C and D ) .
That there is an entichment for T cells reacting against BZLF1/BMLF1 ] antigens within the inflamed joints of patient 1 is supported by two lines of evidence .
First , T cells expressing TCR-B chains with VB/JB combinations and lengths identical to those expressed by EBV-reactive T cell clones accounted for ~30 % of synovial T cells , but only a minute fraction of peripheral blood T cells from patient 1 { Table 1 } .
Second , TNF production by short-term cultured synovial fluid and peripheral blood T cells from patient 1 induced by COS cells transfected with either HLA-A*0201 , B*4002 , or Cw*QO102 DNAs together with either BZLF ! 1 or BMLF1 cDNAs differ dramatically : compare the amounts of TNF released by synovial as compared to peripheral blood ' I cells after exposure to COS cells transfected with BMLFIL and A*0201 DNAs ( Fig .
4 , upper leff ) or BZLF1 and B*4002 DNAs ( Fig .
4 , lower middle ) .
Signif-icantly , dominant responses to BZLF1/B*4002 and BMLF1/ A*0201 were seen with synovial membrane-derived lymphocytes recovered 27 mo after the first sample ( Fig .
4 ) , indicating that these reactivities are common and long-lasting features of synovial lymphocytes derived from patient 1 .
T Cell Responses to BMLF1/BZLF1 in Other Chronic RA Patients .
_ An enfichment for autologous BLC-reactive T cells within the synovium in another chronic RA patient ( patient 19 ) was suggested by the fact that unlike PBL clones , 4 of 12 randomly chosen CD # 8 ! '
synovial clones derived 1795 Scotet et al .

from this patient reacted against the autologous BLC ( 20 ) .
Because the HLA restriction of these clones was established ( 3 clones were HLA-B*35 restricted and 1 clone was HLA-A*24 restricted ) ( Table 1 ) , we could evaluate their reactiv~ ity toward BZLF1 and BMLF1 after transfection of the corresponding cDNA into COS cells together with HLA-A*2401 or -B*3501 cDNAs .
Whereas the HLA-A*24-restricted clone reacted against neither BMLF1 nor BZLFI { data not shown ) , all the HLA-B*35-restricted F cell clones turned out to recognize BZLF1 ( Table 3 ) .
T cell responses to BMLFI1L and BZLF1 were also studied at the polyclonal level in patient 19 and in several HLA-A*02+ chronic RA patients .
In agreement with the above results , a clear TNF response was detected when incubating short-term cultured synovial T cells from patient 19 with HLA-B*3501/BZLF1-transfected COS cells ( Fig .
5 , right ) .
Moreover , companson of the amounts of TNF released by PBL and SFL under these assay conditions strongly suggested an enrichment within the synovium for T cells reac- tive against BZLF1 in patient 19 ( Fig .
5 ) .

Similarly to patient 1 , an enrichment for HLA-A*02/BMLF1 reactive cells within the joints of patient 6 was seen when comparing TNF production obtained with PBL and SFL .
Taken together , these results suggest that T cells reactive against these EBV transactivators are frequently expanded during chronic RA .
Evaluation of Cytolytic Activity of Synovial T Cell Clones toward BLC .
- Because BLC are known to be latently infected by EBV , the recognition by BLC-reactive T cells of BMLF1 or BZLF1 , which are expressed exclusively during the virus lytic cycle , was rather unexpected and prompted us to analyze further the functional behavior of these T cells toward BLC .
Although synovial T cell clones strongly pro BMLFL cDNA together with HLA-A*0201 lef ) , B '' 4002 { upper middle ) , or Cw*0102 ( upper right ) , or BZLFL cDNA together with HLA-A*0201 ( fower lef ) , B*4002 { lower muddle ) , or Cw*0102 DNA ( lower right ) .
Lymphocytes were added at three concentrations to COS cells 1 d after transfection , and TNF release was measured 1 d later .
Specific TNF release was calculated by subtracung values obtained with COS cells transfected with BZLFI or BMLFI1 and an irrelevant HLA DNA { A*0101 } from those obtauned under the above conditions Note that dominant responses to BMLFL/A*0201 and BZLF1/B*4002 were observed with hoth SPL and SML recovered 27 mo later .
There was at least a 100-fold difference { on a per cell basis } between the amounts of TNF released by SFL versus PBL after exposure to BMLFL/A*0201- and BZLF1/B*4002-transfected COS cells .
Weak but significant responses to BMLF1/B*4002 ( upper middle ) , BZLFL/A*0201 ( lower lef ) , and BZLFL/CW* '' 0102 ( lower right ) were obtaned with SFL and/or SML .

This could not be explained by a lack of lytic potential because ( a ) these clones efficiently lysed BLC in the presence of lectin ( Table 4 ) , and ( b ) addition of appropriate synthetic peptides to synovial T cell clones resulted in efficient peptide self presentation and autocytotoxicity ( Figs .
1 and 3 ) .
Actually , this peculiar behavior is most probably explained by the T cell clone 's fine specificity .

Such cells could efficiently trigger proliferation of T cell clones directed against lytic proteins , although their lysis by the corresponding CTL might not be detectable in standard cytotox- icity assays .
Discussion We study here the fine specificity of synovial T cells derived from several chronic RA patients .
Our results indicate that in two patients , a large fraction of T cell clones derived from synovial fluid and synovial membranes of inflamed joints reacts against two EBV transactivators , BMLFIL and BZLF1 .
Moreover , responses against these EBV proteins were evidenced within short-term-cultured synovial T cells derived from several other RA patients .
These observations raise questions regarding ( a ) the mechanisms governing T cell recrutment to the synovium during chronic RA , ( b ) the implication of EBV in chronic RA pathogenesis and the possible pathogenic role of EBV tive T cells , ( c ) the possible dominance of anti-EBV T cell responses in RA patients toward a specific set of proteins , and ( d ) the general significance and consequences of EBV transactivator recognition by T cells .
Regarding the first issue , it has been widely accepted that synovium infiltration by T cells in chronic RA results from nonspecific trapping of T cells , c.g. , in response to chemotactic factors released during the inflammatory reaction ( 19 , 31 ) .
Our results show that a large fraction of synovial T cells from two chronic RA patients recognizes a restricted set of EBV antigens , thus demonstrating that at least in some patients , T cell recruitment to the synovium is an active Ag-driven process .
Although conflicting results have been obtained regarding the presence of absence of the EBV genome in synovia ( 32-34 ) , it is possible that EBV-reactive T cells are expanded locally after recognition of EBV-infected cells within the joint .
Alternatively , EBV could trigger cross-reactive T cell responses against cellular proteins expressed in target organs .
In this regard , several reports have described shared sequences between MHC alleles linked to increased RA susceptibility and EBV glyco-proteins ( 35-38 ) .
With respect to the second issue , implication of EBV in RA was first proposed several years ago , based on several clinical studies demonstrating increased EBV loads and anti-EBV Ab titers in the sera of RA patients ( 39 , 40 ) .
However , since no evidence for increased anti-EBV responses in RA lesions was provided , the physiopathological significance of these findings has remained controversial .
In particular , the possibility that these clinical observations reflected a general alteration of immune responses due to chronic inflammation rather than an active participation of EBV infection in RA pathogenesis could not be ruled out .
In this regard , our demonstration that EBV-reactive T cells are enriched within the joints of chronic RA patients pro-vides , for the first ume , a direct link between EBV and RA .
Furthermore , the fact that these patients showed con-comittantly high anti-EBV Ab titers suggests that increased anti-EBV serological responses previously found in a large fraction of chronic RA patients ( 39 , 40 ) is associated with specific activation of EBV-reactive T cells within the le-sions , Although our results suggest that EBV-reactive T cells in RA lesions are very likely to be pathogenic , it remains to be established definitively whether these cells exert barmful effects , for example , through direct cytotoxicity of release of inflammatory cytokines activating T cell-independent joint erosion ( e.g. , mediated by synoviocytes ) ( 19 ) .
Analysis of the in vivo behavior of these cells ( e.g. , in SCID models ) will certainly help resolve these issues .
Whether of not anti-EBV responses in RA are directed against a restncted set of antigens is another interesting ques-tion .
At present , a comparison of EBV responses between RA and non-RA individuals remains difficult , because none of the studies performed to date have really addressed T cell responses against EBV lytic proteins in non-RA EBV-infected individuals ( 30 ) .
Moreover , the fact that some BLC-reactive synovial T cell clones do not respond to BMLF1 or BZLF1 in COS transfection assays strongly suggests recognition of a larger set of EBV proteins by RA patient , derived T cells .
Despite this , biased anti-EBV responses toward proteins of the virus replicative cycle in RA patients is strongly suggested by the following observations .
As mentioned before , EBV is known to enter the lytic cycle only in a minonty of cells in BLC cultures .
Therefore a dominant response against proteins expressed at that stage could explain both the decreased cytotoxic responses against autologous BLC frequently observed in RA patients ( 41 , 42 ) and our inability to detect significant killing of BLC by synovial CTL in standard cytotoxicity assays ( Table 4 ) .
It is noteworthy that this peculiar behavior could also explain why synovial CD8+* T cell responses to EBV have not been detected before , because specificity of these cells is classically established through cytotoxicity assays .
Beyond the field of autoimmunity , these observations provide new insights into the fine specificity of the anti-EBV T cell response and the immune control of EBV reactiva-tion , because they provide the first clear-cut evidence that the BZLF1 and BMLF1 EBV -transactivating proteins can be targets for CD8¢ T cells .
T cell recognition of such proteins has been suspected in several EBV -linked pathological situations { e.g. , acute infectious mononucleosis , nasopha-ryngeal carcinoma , EBV reactivation in immunodepressed patients ) during which serological Ab titers against product and other early antigens are significantly increased ( for review see reference 30 ) .
However , technical limitations have hampered direct analysis of T cell responses directed against EBV lytic antigens .
The physiological significance of BZLF1/BMLF1L recognition by T cells can be inferred from the function of these proteins during virus replication .
BZLF1 is the first gene expressed during the immediate early stage of the EBV lytic cycle , and it is thought to turn on expression of many other immediate early genes ( 43 ) .
BMLF1 is a delayed immediate early gene with promiscuous transactivating properties that acts syner-gistically with BMLFL and another EBV transactivator , BRLEF1 , in in vitro assays ( 43 ) .
It is therefore likely that T cell responses against these two key transactivators of EBV lytic infection play a central role in controlling virus spreading under physiological and pathological situations .
With the recent development of murine models allowing in vivo analysis of anti-EBV human T cell responses ( 44 ) , this hypothesis can now be tested .
