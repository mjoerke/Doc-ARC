LAIRMORE*t *Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences , College of Veterinary Medicine and tComprehensive Cancer Center , The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute The Ohio State University , Columbus Ohio , USA SUMMARY Promoter sequences responsive to cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) are found in a number of cellular genes , and bind transcription factors of the cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) /activating transcription factor-1 ( ATF-1 ) family .
We have used a human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) model of cAMP response element ( CRE ) transcription to investigate the influence of lymphocyte activation on transcription from homologous regions in the viral promoter .
We previously demonstrated increased HTLV-1 transcription following CD2 but not CD3 receptor cross-linking .
We hypothesized that this increased viral transcription was mediated , in part , through the phosphorylation of CREB .
Therefore , we investigated CD2 and CD3 receptor-mediated signalling in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
CD2 , but not CD3 , cross-linking increased cAMP detected by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) approximately fourfold .
CD2 cross-linking concurrently increased phosphorylation of CREB detected by immunoblot assay eightfold .
Consistent with post-translational regulation , no change in total level of CREB protein was observed .
Phosphorylation of CREB occurred through a herbimycin A and Rp-cAMP-sensitive pathway , suggesting phosphorylation required antecedent activation of both protein tyrosine kinases ( PTK ) and protein kinase A ( PKA ) .
Both CD2 and CD3 cross-linking increased binding of nuclear proteins to a radiolabelled CRE oligonucleotide probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggesting that lymphocyte activation enhances binding independently of phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 .
These data indicate specific modulation of the CREB/ATF-1 family of transcription factors by the CD2 signalling pathway and suggest CD2 receptor modulation of CRE-mediated transcription following ligand engagement ( e.g .
cell-to-cell contact ) .
INTRODUCTION Cyclic AMP-responsive promoter sequences modulate transcription of a variety of cellular genes , of which the best characterized cAMP responsive element ( CRE ) is the 8 base pair palindromic sequence , 5-TGACGTCA-3 ' . '
Transcription factors binding this motif include members of the cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) and activation transcription factor ( ATF ) family of leucine zipper proteins .
These proteins are regulated post-transcriptionally through Received 23 June 1998 ; revised 1 August 1998 ; accepted 4 August 1998 .

phosphorylation , in particular by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase , protein kinase A ( PKA ) ( reviewed by Montminy ' ) .
Phosphorylation of the CRE binding protein CREB at serine 133 is considered a prerequisite for transcription from CRE promoters .
Phosphorylated CREB ( P-CREB ) is postulated to recruit the transcriptional coactivator/CREB binding protein , CBP , which interacts with members of the transcriptional complex including RNA polymerase II , TFIIB and TFIID to initiate transcription . ''
We have used the human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) model of CRE-mediated transcription to investigate the influence of lymphocyte activation on the viral promoter in T lymphocytes . ''
The HTLV-1 promoter/enhancer contains three imperfect 21 base pair repeats responsive to transactiv-ation by the viral encoded 40 kDa protein , Tax ( reviewed by Franchini ' ) .
These tax responsive elements ( TRE ) each contain three domains of which the central B domain ( 5-TGACG-3 '' ) is homologous to cellular CRE sites and binds the CREB/ ATF family of transcription factors .
Tax differentially activates the HTLV-1 TRE and cellular CRE sites .
Unlike CRE transcription , in vitro transcription through TRE sites is not strictly dependent on phosphorylation of CREB .
* '' However , cAMP ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd CD2 signalling induces phosphorylation of CREB 545 augments Tax-dependent transcription suggesting that phosphorylation of CREB in vivo may enhance transcription from TRE sites . ''
We have previously demonstrated increased viral transcription following CD2 but not CD3 stimulation of immortalized lymphocyte cell lines infected with HTLV-1 and in Jurkat T cells transiently cotransfected with the HTLV-1 promoter and trans-activating protein Tax .
* As anticipated , significant levels of viral transcription required expression of the CRE-homolo-gous TRE sites .
Since these sites bind the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors and CD2 signalling has been reported to induce cAMP , ° we hypothesized the increase in transcription we observed was mediated through the cAMP/P-CREB signalling pathway .
The role of cAMP in lymphocyte proliferation is only partly understood .
By decreasing interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production cAMP blocks cell cycle progression and inhibits cell proliferation . ''
Cyclic AMP inhibits Jnk kinases in lympho-cytes '' and induces the inducible cAMP repressor ICER , which inhibits calcineurin-mediated expression of the IL-2 promoter . ''
None the less , cAMP is induced in lymphocytes following mitogen , CD2 and CD3 receptor stimulation , suggesting a positive or at least a regulatory role for cAMP in lymphocyte proliferation .
'*~* ' Interactions of the cAMP and CD3 activation pathways are partly defined .
CD3 cross-linking induces cAMP and binding of nuclear proteins to CRE sites in murine splenic T cells entering late G1 or S phase of the cell cycle . ''
In addition , phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 has been demonstrated in Jurkat cells following CD3 cross-linking .
'* These events are postulated to occur through a receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinase pathway with activation of PLCy1 and protein kinase C ( PKC ) preceding activation of PKA . ''
Less is known about cAMP signalling following perturbation of the CD2 receptor .
While CD2 signalling occurs primarily through the CD3 & chain , '' differences in tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca** kinetics have been demonstrated following CD2 and CD3 receptor cross-linking .
**** We postulated that similar differences may exist in the cAMP signalling pathway , to account for the differential transcriptional activation we observed in the HTLV-1 system .
We therefore evaluated the effects of CD2 and CD3 receptor cross-linking on cAMP signalling and phosphorylation of CREB in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
Our studies confirm that CD2 cross-linking induces cAMP in primary human PBMC and demonstrate a temporally associated increase in phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 without a concomitant increase in level of CREB protein .
Phosphorylation of CREB occurred through an herbimycin A sensitive pathway , suggesting that activation of the cAMP signalling cascade is initiated upon activation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases .
Consistent with phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase , PKA , Rp-cAMP reduced the level of P-CREB ~33 % .
Inhibitors of other protein kinases demonstrated to phosphorylate CREB in vitro , including the PKC inhibitor calphostin C and the calcium/ calmodulin ( CaM ) kinase inhibitor cyclosporin A ( CsA ) had no effect on CD2-mediated phosphorylation of CREB .
Lymphocyte activation through both the CD2 and CD3 receptors increased binding of CREB protein to a specific P-radiolabelled CRE oligonucleotide probe , suggesting that fac- ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 95 , 544-552 tors other than phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 enhance DNA binding .
In summary , our studies indicate that CD2-mediated lymphocyte activation induces phosphorylation of CREB , and that this occurs at least , in part , through a protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) and PKA dependent pathway .
These data indicate specific modulation of the CREB/ATF-1 family of transcription factors by the CD2 signalling pathway and suggest that the CD2 receptor may have important implications for both TRE and CRE-mediated transcription following cell-cell contact .
MATERIALS AND METHODS PBMC PBMC were obtained by leukophoresis from HTLV-1-negative donors as previously described . ''
Briefly , PBMC were obtained from elutriated cell packs by Ficoll-Hypaque separation and stored as frozen aliquots in liquid nitrogen using standard techniques .
Cells were removed from liquid nitrogen , checked for viability by trypan blue exclusion and placed in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 0-3 mg/ml L-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 ug/ml streptomycin , and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( complete RPMI-1640 ) .
After a 48-hr rest in culture , cells were centrifuged , resuspended at 1 x 10° cells/ml in fresh medium and placed in receptor stimulation protocols .
The cells were cultured in the absence of exogenously added IL-2 to avoid costimulatory effects of the IL-2 pathway .
PBMC viability after thawing and receptor-mediated stimulation experiments were routinely 90 % or greater in viability .
Receptor cross-linking Receptor cross-linking was performed - as previously described . ''
Briefly , optimal concentrations of anti-CD3 and anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) were determined in preliminary experiments as assessed by [ PH ] thymidine incor-poration .
Immobilized anti-CD3 mAb was plated into wells of 6- , 24- or 96-well plates by incubating a 1:200 dilution of mAb in nonsupplemented RPMI-1640 media for 1 hr at 37° ( OKT3 , 0-625 mg/ml final concentration , Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc. Rariton , NJ . ) .
The anti-CD2 mAbs 39C1.5 and 6F10.3 ( Tll.1 and T1ll.2 epitopes , respectively , AMAC , Inc , Westbrook , ME ) , were used paired in soluble form at 2:5 mg/ml in RPMI .
A mouse mAb to bovine prolactin ( pri ) served as a non-binding control ( 2:5 mg/ml , courtesy of Dr Charles Brooks , The Ohio State University ) .
The cells were cultured in the absence of exogenously added IL-2 to avoid costimulatory effects of the IL-2 pathway .
To verify effectiveness of receptor cross-linking and inhibition protocols , cell proliferation was assessed in each experiment by determining [ PH ] thymidine incorporation in stimulated and unstimulated PBMC after 72 hr in culture as previously described .
`` * Results are expressed both as mean c.p.m .
+SD of triplicate samples , and as stimulation indices presenting the percentage of [ BH incorporation measured in stimulated cells compared with unstimulated cell controls .
Cyclic AMP assay A competitive solid phase ELISA with a sensitivity in the range of 4-1052 pg was used to detect cAMP in PBMC ( Biotrak EIA system , Amersham , UK ) .
Briefly , 1 x 10° PBMC 546 D. J. Guyot et al .
were stimulated for periods ranging from 5 min to 4 hr , harvested , washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , resuspended in cold 60 % ethanol and held overnight at -20° to extract cAMP .
Cell debris was pelleted and the supernatant lyophilized .
The dried pellet containing cAMP was dissolved in 0:5 ml assay buffer and the assay performed according to manufacturer 's instructions .
Western blot analysis Whole cell lysates were prepared from 5x 10° stimulated or unstimulated PBMC and probed for CREB and serine 133 P-CREB proteins according to manufacturers instructions { PhosphoPlus Creb Antibody kit , New England BioLabs , Beverly , MA . ) .
Briefly , cells were pelleted , washed in PBS , lysed in 200 ul of sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) sample buffer , quantified by spectrophotometry and 10 ug resolved in a denaturing 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) minigel ( Readygel , Gibco BRL Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD . ) .
Proteins were transferred overnight to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes ( Immobilon P , Millipore , Bedford , MA . )
and CREB or P-CREB proteins detected using a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for either CREB or serine 133 P-CREB proteins followed by 1:2000 of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antirabbit secondary antibody .
The antibody used to detect the phosphorylated form of CREB also reacts with the phosphorylated form of the closely related ATF-1 protein .
Chemiluminescence was detected by autoradiography and bands quantified by densitometric scanning .
Consistency of loading was verified by Coomassie staining of gels run concurrently .
In some experiments , inhibitors of protein kinases ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) were added 16 hr prior to placing cells in stimulation protocols .
Starting concentrations of inhibitors were obtained from referenced studies and concentrations subsequently optimized in PBMC choosing the concentration which maximally modulated P-CREB levels following CD2 receptor signalling .
The PTK inhibitor herbimycin A ( ICs , 70-900 nm ) , which binds and promotes degradation of PTKs was used at 2 um '' The PKC inhibitor , calphostin C , which causes irreversible oxidative modification by binding the regulatory domain of PKC was used at 0-5 uM ( ICs , 0-05 um ) .
The phosphorothiol-ated Rp-isomer of cAMP , which acts as a PKA specific inhibitor by binding and inhibiting release of the catalytic subunit of PKA was used at 150 um ( ICs , 11 um ) .
The CaM kinase pathway inhibitor , CsA which blocks calcineurin-mediated activation of the CaM kinases was used at 2 ug/ml .
These concentrations of inhibitors were determined in preliminary studies to affect cellular proliferation ( determined by [ PH ] thymidine incorporation ) but did not reduced cell viability ( as assessed by trypan blue exclusion ) after incubation with the treatments .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay Nuclear extracts were prepared from 1x 10 ' stimulated or unstimulated PBMC and evaluated as described '' using 5 ug of nuclear lysate , 1 ug dI-dC and 40000 c.p.m .
of *P end-labelled CRE-specific or mutant oligonucleotide probe ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA . ) .
Lysates were quantified by Micro BCA Protein Assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and compared to Coomassie staining of denaturing protein gels run concurrently to visually assess protein quality and quantity .
To identify CREB-containing complexes , DNA-protein complexes were supershifted with 1 ul of anti-CREB antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Where indi-cated , specificity of binding was determined in competition experiments adding 50 ng of unlabelled oligonucleotide probe prior to addition of radiolabelled probe .
Following polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis , gels were dried and specific activity determined by phosphor-imaging analysis ( Phosphor-imager model 445-PC , analysed by ImageQuaNT version 4.1b , Molecular Dynamics , Sunneyvale CA . ) .
RESULTS Receptor cross-linking increases [ PH | thymidine incorporation in stimulated PBMC The CD2 receptor functions both as an adhesion molecule and in antigen-specific and antigen-independent lymphocyte activation .
While the signalling pathways effecting these functions likely diverge , lymphocyte proliferation is a measurable endpoint of cell activation and provided a positive control for receptor stimulation in these studies .
As a measure of proliferation , we determined [ PH ] thymidine incorporation in quiescent and stimulated PBMC after 72 hr in culture with anti-CD2 or anti-CD3 mAbs in the absence of exogenously added IL-2 to avoid costimulatory effects of the IL-2 pathway .
The TIlI.1 and TIl.2 pair of anti-CD2 mAbs used in these studies increased [ °H ] thymidine incorporation an average sixfold over that observed in the prl control stimulated cells .
In the experiment presented in Fig .

in the CD2-stimulated population .
PBMC proliferated more strongly in response to anti-CD3 mAbs .
CD3 cross-linking increased [ °H ] thymidine incorporation an average 38-fold , to 48 675+5169 c.p.m .
in the experiment shown .
Mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin { ( PHA ) increased [ °H ] thymidine incorporation an average 50-fold .
Consistent with the inhibitory effects of cAMP on cell proliferation , direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin decreased spontaneous [ *H ] thymidine incorporation 290 % ( Fig .
1 ) .
Induction of cAMP We previously demonstrated increased HTLV-1 transcription within 24 hr of CD2 but not CD3 cross-linking of immortalized HTLV-1-infected lymphocyte cell lines and in Jurkat T cells cotransfected with the HTLV-1 promoter and a Tax-expressing plasmid .
* Significant levels of reporter gene activity required expression of viral Tax responsive elements .
These elements are homologous to cellular cAMP response elements and bind the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors .
While TRE-mediated transcription is not strictly dependent on phosphorylation of CREB , cAMP augments transcription from TRE sites .
Because CD2 , but not CD3 , cross-linking increased HTLV-1 transcription , we postulated that CD2 , but not CD3 , cross-linking induced cAMP .
We therefore evaluated levels of cAMP at 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 , and 240 min following CD2 and CD3 receptor stimulation of primary human PBMC .

As CD2 receptor stimulation increased cAMP fourfold within 15 min in culture , we postulated CD2 cross-linking would be temporally associated with phosphorylation of CREB .
We evaluated P-CREB at 0-5 , 1 , 4 and 24 hr following CD2 or CD3 cross-linking .
CD2 stimulation increased phosphorylation of CREB an average eightfold over that observed in the control pri-stimulated cells within 1 hr in culture ( Fig .

P-CREB returned to basal levels within 4 hr of receptor cross-linking ( data not shown ) .
No significant change in level of CREB phosphorylation was observed following CD3 cross-linking of primary human PBMC .
Interestingly , mitogenic stimulation with PHA increased P-CREB with stoichiometry comparable to that observed following CD2 cross-linking even though PHA treatment was not associated with induction of cAMP .
Forskolin treatment increased P-CREB approximately threefold , consistent with the lower level of cAMP observed following forskolin treatment .
Consistent with previous reports of post-transcriptional regulation of 548 D. J. Guyot et al .
CREB , '' no change in total level of CREB protein was demonstrated following receptor cross-linking ( Fig .

Inhibitors of protein kinases differentially modulate lymphocyte The eightfold increase in P-CREB detected following CD2 cross-linking was temporally associated with a fourfold increase in cAMP .
However , no increase in cAMP was observed following PHA treatment despite consistently elevated levels of P-CREB .
These results suggest that phosphorylation of CREB in lymphocytes occurs through both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent pathways .
While PKA is postulated to be the major mechanism regulating phosphorylation of CREB at ser-133 in vivo , PKC , CaM kinases , casein kinases I , II and IV have all been demonstrated to phosphorylate CREB in vitro .
To evaluate the contributions of these protein kinase signalling cascades in primary human PBMC , we pretreated PBMC with different protein kinase inhibitors for 16 hr before placing them in CD2 receptor cross-linking protocols .
To control for inhibition of protein kinase signalling we evaluated *H-thymidine incorporation in treated and untreated PBMC after 72 hr in culture with control or anti-CD2 mAbs .
In the experiment shown in Fig .

While a 16-hr preincubation of PBMC with 150 um Rp-cAMP increased [ *H ] thymidine incorporation approximately twofold , Rp-cAMP inhibited phosphorylation of CREB an average 33 % following CD2 cross-linking ( Fig .

Inhibitors of PKC and CaM kinases have no effect on CD2-mediated phosphorylation of CREB Our results suggest either that inhibition of the PKA pathway was incomplete or that PKA is not the sole serine/threonine kinase phosphorylating CREB in vivo .

In addition , activation of PKC may precede activation of adenylate cyclase in lymphocytes following CD3 cross-linking . ''
Protein kinase C , CaM kinases , casein kinases I , II and IV have all been demonstrated to directly or indirectly phosphorylate CREB in vitro , but their contribution in vivo has not been determined .
We inhibited the PKC and CaM kinase signalling pathways and evaluated the effects on CD2-induced phosphorylation of CREB .
While pretreatment of PBMC with 0:5 mm calphostin C decreased CD2-induced [ H ] thymidine incorporation 80 % , calphostin C increased P-CREB xzl4-fold ( Fig .

The Rp-isomer of cAMP ( 150 um ) which inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase , decreased the level of P-CREB observed following CD2 cross-linking an average 33 % ( range 29-40 % reduction ) .
( b ) Cyclosporin A , an inhibitor of calcineurin-induced CaM kinase activation , had no effect on CD2-mediated phosphorylation of CREB .
In separate experiments , cells were pretreated with 2 ug/ml CsA for 16 hr before placement in receptor stimulation protocols .
The first lane contains lysate from pri control stimulated cells and demonstrates the low levels of P-CREB constitutively produced after 1 hr in culture .
The second lane contains lysate from CD2-stimulated cells not pretreated with CsA , and demonstrates an ~10-fold increase in P-CREB over that observed in the pri-stimulated control .
Cells in lane 3 were treated for 16 hr with 2 ug/ml CsA before CD2 stimulation .
While pretreatment with CsA reduced [ ' H incorporation by 90 % , CsA had no significant effect on the level of P-CREB induced following CD2 cross-linking .
( c ) The percentage change in P-CREB levels as determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs following inhibition of CD2 signalling is averaged from three separate trials .
At the concentrations used the inhibitors did not reduce cell viability or constitutive levels of CREB ( data not shown ) .

Receptor cross-linking increased CREB binding to a CRE oligonucleotide probe While CREB constitutively binds DNA , reports conflict regarding the effects of phosphorylation on DNA binding ( reviewed by Montminy '' ) .
We therefore evaluated nuclear lysates from control , anti-CD2 and anti-CD3 stimulated cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for binding of CREB to a *°P-radiolabelled CRE oligonucleotide probe .
An average two- to threefold increase in binding was observed 1 hr after either CD2 or CD3 stimulation ( Fig .
5 ) .
The dominant CRE specific band ( pl ) was supershifted with anti-CREB mAbs , demonstrating that CREB is a major constituent of this band .
Specificity was determined by eliminating DNA binding with a 100-fold excess of unlabelled CRE probe and by demonstrating lack of binding to a radiolabelled mutant oligonucleotide probe .
These results suggest that while lymphocyte activation increases binding of CREB to DNA , this occurs independently of phosphorylation of CREB .

CD2 and CD3 cross-linking increase binding of CREB to a CRE oligonucleotide probe .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as indicated in Materials and Methods and evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for binding to a CRE-specific oligonucleotide probe .
Low levels of protein binding to the CRE probe were present in control cells ( lane 1 ) .
An average two- to threefold increase in binding of the most prominent specific band ( p1 ) was observed following either CD2 ( 2-5-fold increase shown ) or CD3 ( 1+5-fold increase shown ) cross-linking .
This band was supershifted with anti-CREB antibodies , demonstrating that CREB is a component of band pl ( lanes 4-6 ) .
Specific binding was eliminated with a 100-fold excess of unlabelled probe ( lane 7 ) .
No binding at pl was observed to a radiolabelled mutant oligonucleotide probe ( lane 8 ) .
Graph represents percentage change in pl signal following CD2 and CD3 stimulation measured by phosphoimage analysis .
Results from this experiment are representative of those obtained from at least four separate experiments using three different preparations of nuclear extracts .
DISCUSSION Our studies are the first to demonstrate a temporally associated eightfold increase in phosphorylation of CREB peaking 1 hr after CD2 stimulation of human PBMC .
While phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 is a necessary prerequisite for transcriptional activation through CRE promoters ' '' its role in transcription from TRE sites in vivo is less clear .
Phosphorylation of CREB is not an absolute prerequisite for transcription from TRE sites in vitro . ''
However , cAMP augments Tax-dependent transcription in vivo , suggesting that phosphorylation of CREB may enhance dimerization of transcription factors and recruitment of the transcriptional complex to TRE sites . ''
We have recently reported increased viral transcription following CD2 but not CD3 stimulation of immortalized lymphocyte cell lines infected with HTLV-1 and in Jurkat T cells transiently cotransfected with the HTLV-1 promoter and transactivating protein Tax . ''
Collectively , these studies suggest a P-CREB-dependent mechanism for the increase in HTLV-1 gene transcription we observed following CD2 cross-linking of HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes .
It is important to note that the use of primary cells is uncommon in viral transcription studies .
Our approach of using primary cells has allowed us to identify fundamental events in HTLV-1 transcription . ''
The biological relevance of transcriptional regulation in cell lines has recently been challenged as differences between Jurkat and PBMC signalling pathways have been reported . ''
Thus , we chose to use primary human PBMC to examine the effects of CD2 signalling in the regulation of CREB .
Phosphorylation of CREB occurred through an herbimycin A and Rp-cAMP sensitive pathway , suggesting that phosphorylation required antecedent activation of both PTK and PKA .
Herbimycin A may have inhibited CD2 signal transduction through src family PTK at the cell membrane or inhibited cytoplasmic PTK including members of the Tec family . '' ''
Previous studies demonstrated dependence of the cAMP signalling pathway on the protein phosphatase CD45 , implicate the membrane associated PTK in this pathway . ''
Further study will be required to determine if CD2-directed phosphorylation occurred through a p56 '' **- or pS59 '' -dependent pathway .
Phosphorylation of CREB in vivo is postulated to occur through PKA-dependent pathways .
Consistent with this hypothesis , the PKA specific inhibitor Rp-cAMP reduced phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 an average 33 % .
However , increasing concentrations of Rp-cAMP did not further decrease phosphorylation , suggesting either that PKA was incompletely inhibited by Rp-cAMP or that CREB is also phosphorylated in vivo by other serine/threonine kinases .
Consistent with this hypothesis , other studies have demonstrated cAMP -independent phosphorylation of CREB following anti-CD3 or IL-2 stimulation of cloned T lymphocytes suggesting a role for PKC , the CaM kinases , casein kinases I , II and IV in vivo . ''
Interestingly , inhibition of the PKC pathway with calphostin C modestly increased the level of P-CREB detected .
Whether this was a result of increased phosphorylation of CREB or decreased PP1/PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation remains to be determined . ''
Inhibition of the CaM kinase pathway had no effect on P-CREB following CD2 cross-linking in our system .
However , we have not eliminated involvement of other protein kinase pathways in the phosphorylation of CREB following CD2 signalling .
We did not observe phosphorylation of CREB within 1 hr of CD3 cross-linking of primary human PBMC unless a costimulatory signal from exogenous IL-2 was supplied .
`` * Previous studies demonstrating phosphorylation of CREB following CD3 cross-linking used model systems with costimulatory signals such as murine lymphocytes at G1 or S phases of the cell ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 95 , 544-552 CD2 signalling induces phosphorylation of CREB cycle '' or in the preactivated IL-2-independent transformed Jurkat cell line .
'* Both CD2 and CD3 cross-linking increased binding of CREB protein to a specific radiolabelled oligonucleotide probe , suggesting that binding of CREB to DNA is not related directly to phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 .
As both Wollberg et al . ' ''
and Nichols et al . '' ''
suggest binding is phosphorylation dependent , phosphorylation at other sites may modulate DNA binding .
Alternatively , activation signals common to both CD2 and CD3 signalling may mediate binding of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors to DNA by recruiting other proteins which enhance or stabilize DNA binding .
In summary , our results demonstrate activation of the cAMP second messenger system following CD2 signalling and enhance our understanding of this pathway by demonstrating protein tyrosine kinase and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB in primary human PBMC .
Specific modulation of the CREB/ATF-1 family of transcription factors by the CD2 signalling pathway suggests the CD2 receptor may be important in CRE-mediated transcription following cell-cell contact , and has important implications for transcription of genes containing CRE related sequences , such as HTLV-1 .
