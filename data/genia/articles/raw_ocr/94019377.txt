Box 208035 , New Haven , Connecticut 06520-8035 Received 14 December 1992/Returned for modification 9 April 1993/Accepted 9 August 1993 Expression of the human CDS gene is restricted to cells of the lymphoid lineage and developmentally regulated during thymopoiesis .
As an initial step towards understanding the molecular basis for tissue-specific expression of this gene , we surveyed the surrounding chromatin structure for potential cis-acting regulatory regions by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping and found four hypersensitive sites , three of which were T cell restricted .
By using a reporter-based expression approach , a T-cell-specific enhancer was identified by its close association with a prominent T-cell-restricted hypersensitive sites in the last intron of the CD8a « gene .
Deletion studies demonstrated that the minimal enhancer is adjacent to a negative regulatory element .
DNA sequence analysis of the minimal enhancer revealed a striking cluster of consensus binding sites for Ets-1 , TCF-1 , CRE , GATA-3 , LyF-1 , and bHLH proteins which were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
In addition , the 5 ' end of the enhancer was composed of an 4/u repeat which contained the GATA-3 , bHLH , and LyF-1 binding sites .
Site-directed mutation of the Ets-1 and GATA-3 sites dramatically reduced enhancer activity .
The functional importance of the other binding sites only became apparent when combinations of mutations were analyzed .
Taken together , these results suggest that the human CD8a « gene is regulated by the interaction of multiple T-cell nuclear proteins with a transcriptional enhancer located in the last intron of the gene .
Comparison of the CD8 « enhancer with other recently identified T-cell-specific regulatory elements suggests that a common set of transcription factors regulates several T-cell genes .
The T-lymphocyte differentiation marker CD8 identifies a distinct T-cell subset which can be triggered to express cytotoxic and/or suppressor activity upon recognition of antigenic peptides presented in the context of class I major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecules ( 46 , 62 , 75 ) .
Expressed on the T-cell surface as either an « /a homodimer or « /B heterodimer , CD8 is capable of direct extracellular interaction with the « 3 domain of MHC class I molecules ( 12 , 60 , 63 , 68 ) and intracellular association with the tyrosine kinase p56 '' ( 3 , 8 ) , assisting both the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) in antigen recognition and the CD3 complex in signal trans-duction .
Thus , CD8 serves as an integral part of a complex recognition/response apparatus which functions to initiate antigen-driven activation of mature effector T cells in the periphery as well as differentiation of immature T cells in the thymus .
Tissue-specific expression of CD8 is under precise developmental control .
When bone marrow-derived precursor cells begin the process of thymopoiesis , a panel of T-cell-specific genes ( TCR , CD2 , CD3 , and CD4 ) including CD8a « and CD8f are coordinately expressed in a defined temporal sequence ( 10 , 32 , 45 ) .
Early in this differentiation pathway , the most immature T cells ( CD4~ CD8~T ) progress to an intermediate phenotype expressing both CD4 and CD8 .
These CD4* CD8* T cells , representing the majority of thymocytes , subsequently undergo a further differentiation * Corresponding author .

7056 step in which the specificity of the TCR repertoire is selected by both positive and negative pressures , a process mediated , in part , by CD8 ( 1 , 19 , 35 , 70 , 84 ) .
The outcome of this developmental event is the maturation of T cells which express either CD4 or CD8 , but not both .
These mature cells , representing for the most part either the MHC class II-restricted helper subset ( CD4+* CD8~ ) or the MHC class TI-restricted cytotoxic/suppressor subset ( CD4~ CD8* ) , exit the thymus and seed the peripheral lymphoid tissues .
In contrast to these thymus-dependent T cells which generally express both CD8a « and CD8B during at least one stage of their development , extrathymically derived intraepithelial lymphocytes and natural killer lymphocytes express only CD8a ( 36 , 62 , 77 ) .
Thus , expression of CD8a and CD8B may be both coordinately and independently regulated , in that both of these genes are expressed at distinct stages of thymic ontogeny , yet only CD8a is expressed in specific subsets of extrathymic lymphocytes .
While the function of CD8 and its differential expression pattern have been extensively studied , the mechanisms governing transcription of both the CD8a « and CD8B genes during these developmental processes remain poorly under-stood .
Since these two distinct genes are closely linked on human chromosome 2 ( 7 , 56 ) and on mouse chromosome 6 ( 25 ) , they may be coordinately regulated by a locus control region ( 15 , 33 ) .
However , these genes may also be independently controlled , given that only CD8a « is expressed in some cell types .
In this regard , each gene appears to have its own promoter element , on the basis of studies determining the transcriptional start sites for each gene ( 57-59 , 72 ) .
In light of Vor .
13 , 1993 the recent observations that the tissue-specific enhancers of other T-cell-restricted genes such as TCR , CD2 , CD3 , and CD4 ( 5 , 6 , 20 , 23 , 31 , 37 , 38 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 51 , 64-66 , 69 , 74 , 76 , 79 , 81 ) bind a common set of transcription factors ( some of which are found only in lymphoid cells ) , CD8 expression may also be controlled by a similar T-cell-specific enhancer .
Furthermore , a negative regulatory element may influence transcription of the CD8 « and CD8B genes , since CD8 expression is down-regulated as helper T cells ( CD4* CD8~ ) mature at the final stage of thymic ontogeny .
To define the molecular mechanisms that regulate CD8 gene expression , we searched for potential regulatory regions by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping .
In the studies described in this report , we have identified a T-cell-specific transcriptional regulatory region found in the last intron of the human CD8a « gene .
The nucleotide sequence of this region contains Alu repeats and a cluster of motifs sharing homology with previously described core enhancers for other T-cell-specific genes ( 20 , 23 , 31 , 38 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 51 , 64-66 , 74 , 76 , 81 ) .
Preliminary characterization of this enhancer indicates that a functional hierarchy exists among the individual cis-acting elements .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture .
All T- and B-lymphoid cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM 1-glu-tamine , 100 U of penicillin per ml , 100 ug of streptomycin per ml , and 10 % fetal calf serum ( Hyclone , Laboratories , Inc. , Logan Utah ) .
Human T-cell lines ( 53 ) used included Jurkat ( CD4+* CD8~ ) , JM ( CD4+* CD8a « *B~ ) , Molt4 ( CD4* CD8a*fB~ ) , and HPB.ALL ( CD4+* CD8a « *B* ) .
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B-cell lines used included Raji and UC ( 24 ) .
The non-lymphoid cell lines HeLa and HepG2 were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented as described above .
All cells were cultured at 37°C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5 % CO , .
DNase I hypersensitivity mapping .
The positions of hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped by the indirect end labeling technique developed by Wu ( 83 ) , with some modifications ( 33 ) .
Briefly , 10° cells were swollen on ice for 10 min by incubation in hypotonic reticulocyte standard buffer , lysed with 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , and immediately disrupted by Dounce homogenization with 10 strokes of a type B homogenization pestle .
Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation ( 250 x g ) , resuspended in 1 ml of reticulocyte standard buffer , divided into 100-pl aliquots , and digested with various amounts of pancreatic DNase I ( 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , and 4.0 pg per 100-pll aliquot ) .
After incubation for 5 min at 37°C , an equal volume of 2 % stop solution ( 600 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.4 ] , 10 mM EDTA [ pH 8.0 } , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , and 500 ug of proteinase K per ml ) was added to terminate the reaction , lyse the nuclei , and digest nuclear proteins .
Following overnight incubation at 37°C , the DNA was extensively extracted with phenol-chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol .
DNA ( 20 ug ) from each sample was digested overnight with HindIII , electrophore-sed on a 0.6 % agarose gel , and transferred to NitroPlus bybridization transfer membranes ( Micron Separations , Inc. ) .
Prehybridized blots were hybridized overnight with a random-primed , *°P-labeled 752-bp HindIII-Pstl probe encompassing the first intron , first exon , and 5'-flanking region of the human CD8a « gene and then washed under high-stringency conditions ( 73 ) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film .
Construction of expression vectors .
The pTKLux plasmid Alu-CONTAINING T-CELL-SPECIFIC CD8 « ENHANCER 7057 ( 29 ) was derived from the firefly luciferase-containing reporter plasmid pLuxF47 ( a gift of John Thompson ) by inserting a polylinker ( annealed oligonucleotides TCCGCGGCGGCCGCCTCGAGAGTCGACATGCATA-3 ' and - 5-GATCTATGCATGTCGACTCTCGAGGCGGCCG CCGCGGA-3 ' , which result in 5'-overhanging ends that are compatible with HindIII and Be/ll or BamHI between the HindIII and BgillI sites upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter ( 52 ) .
A 1,149-bp SphI-XmnI fragment from the last intron of the human CD8a « gene was isolated from the plasmid pgCD8/322 ( 40 ) , inserted into the SpAI and blunted XbelI sites of pBLCAT2 ( 48 ) , and then reisolated after digestion with HindIII and BamHI .
This HindlIII-BamHI fragment containing the 1,149-bp CD8 insert was used to generate the plasmids pTKCD8U+ , pTKCD8U- , pTKCD8D+ , and pTKCD8D- by placing the fragment in either orientation ( + and - ) both upstream ( U ) and downstream ( D ) of the TK promoter ( see Fig .
2A ) .
The plasmids pTKCD8U+ and pTKCD8U- were constructed by inserting this CD8 fragment with the same polylinker ( see above ) into pLuxF47 upstream of the TK promoter at either the HindIII or the Bgill site , respectively .
The plasmids pTKCD8D+ and pTKCD8D- were created by bidirection-ally inserting this fragment with the polylinker into pLuxF47 at the BamHI site located downstream of the simian virus 40 poly ( A ) splice sequences .
Generation of CD8 enhancer deletions .
Nested unidirectional deletions from the 3 ' and 5 ' ends of the 1,149-bp CD8 intronic enhancer fragment were generated in the plasmids pTKCD8U+ and pTKCD8U- , respectively ( Pharmacia double-stranded nested deletion kit ; see Fig .
3A ) .
Prior to timed digestion with exonuclease III and subsequent digestion with S1 nuclease , pTKCD8U+ was cut with Xhol ( located in the polylinker ) and PstI ( located between the polylinker and TK promoter ) and pTKCD8U- was cut with Xhol and NsiI ( both located in the polylinker ) .
Sequence analysis of the resulting deletion-containing plasmids was used to determine the exact extent of deletion in each subclone .
The nomenclature of these constructs reflects both the extent of the deletion and the end from which the deletion was made with respect to the original 1,149-bp CD8 fragment ( 3 ' and 5 ' ends correspond to the XmnI and SphI sites , respectively ) .
For example , p3 ' A-280 is a plasmid in which the CD8 fragment was deleted 280 bp from the 3 ' end .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from each cell line according to the method described by Dignam ( 14 ) and stored at -70°C .
The protein concentration of each extract was determined by the Bradford method ( Bio-Rad ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .
Binding reactions were performed essentially as described ( 18 ) , except that 7.5 ug of nuclear extract was used in each binding reaction .
Previously described sequence from the human CD8a intron was used as a guide for the synthesis of all oligonucleotides corresponding to each protein binding site ( 57 ) .
Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were generated by first annealing a 31- to 33-base oligomer template to a 10-base oligomer primer ( complementary to the 3 ' terminal 10 bases of the template ) and subsequently labeled with [ a « - '' °P ] dATP and [ « -**P ] dCTP by using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Oligomers ( template and primer ) for each binding site are listed in Table 1 .
In each case , the core consensus binding site is underlined and lowercase letters are used to indicate the mutated nucleotides .
For cold competition studies , unlabeled wild-type and mutant templates were similarly produced by using unlabeled deoxynu- 7058 HAMBOR ET AL .

The protein-DNA complexes formed in all binding reactions were resolved by using nondenaturing 5 % polyacrylamide gels as previously described ( 18 ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis .
A 653-bp minimal CD8 enhancer fragment was isolated from p3 ' A-280 by double digestion with TH1111 ( located 216 bp from the 5 ' end ) and Eagl ( located between the 280-bp 3 ' deletion site in the CD8 enhancer and the TK promoter ) , blunted by a Klenow fill-in reaction , ligated to EcoRI linkers , digested with EcoRI , and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescriptSK+ ( Strata-gene ) .
This plasmid ( pBSCD8min ) was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis of the minimal CD8a « enhancer according to the method of Kunkel ( 42 ) ( Bio-Rad Muta-gene Kit ) .
Single-stranded oligomers containing mutations in individual transcription factor binding sites , identical to the mutant templates used to generate probes for EMSA ( see method for EMSA described above ) , were used as primers for the mutagenesis reactions .
In order to mutate the CRE and basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) protein binding sites , the single-stranded oligomers listed in Table 2 were used as primers .
The nucleotides in lowercase letters represent the changes introduced into the wild-type CD8 sequence of the minimal enhancer .
The wild-type sequence , shown merely for comparison to the consensus sequences for each binding site , was not used in these mutagenesis reactions .
Both single and double mutants for each site were produced .
All mutants , as well as the wild-type minimal CD8 enhancer , were sequenced , isolated from pBSCD8min by digestion Site and primer Sequence CRE Consensus motif TGACGTCA Wild-type 5'-AGAGTGCAGACATGACGTCATGATGAATTAG-5 ' Mutant 5'-AGAGTGCAGACActecgagCATGATGAATTAG-3 ' bHLH Consensus motif CANNTG Wild-type 5'-GATCTCCTGACCACGTGATCCGCCCGCCTTG-3 ' Mutant 5'-GATCTCCTGACgeggecegeCCGCCCGCCTTG-3 ' with HindIII and BamHI , and then subcloned into pTKLux between the HindIII and Bg/ll sites upstream of the TK promoter .
Of these constructs , the plasmid designated pTKCD8min contains the wild-type minimal CD8 enhancer .
Single and double mutants for each site are designated by pm followed by the site name .
For example , the plasmid in which the Ets-1 site was mutated is designated pmEts-1 , whereas the plasmid containing mutations in both the GATA-3 and LyF-lu sites is designated pmGATA-3/LyF-lu .
Transfection of DNA into tissue culture cells .
All cell lines were cotransfected with 30 ug of each luciferase reporter construct and 10 pg of the reference plasmid pCMVB-gal ( 49 ) used to determine transfection efficiency .
In each transfection , 10 '' cells in 800 pl of serum-free medium ( RPMI 1640 for JM , Jurkat , and Raji cells and minimal essential medium for HeLa cells ) were electroporated by using a Gene Pulsar ( Bio-Rad ) set at 960 uF and either 250 V for Jurkat , Raji , and HeLa cells or 270 V for JM cells .
Transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 40 to 48 h , harvested , and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline .
Cell pellets were lysed ( luciferase assay system ; Promega , Madison , Wis. ) and extracts quantitated for protein concentration by the Bradford method ( Bio-Rad ) .
Luciferase and B-galactosidase assays .
Cell lysates containing an equivalent amount of protein were assayed for luciferase activity ( luciferase assay system ; Promega ) , by using a modification of the method described by deWet et al .
( 13 ) , and for B-galactosidase activity as described elsewhere ( 16 ) .
For each transfection , a standardized luciferase value was derived ( luciferase activity/B-galactosidase activity ) in order to adjust for variability in transfection efficiency .
Standardized values for enhancer-containing luciferase reporter constructs were subsequently normalized to those obtained for either pTKLux ( see Fig .
2 and 3 ) or pTKCD8min ( see Fig .
4 ) .
The Student ¢ test ( P < 0.05 ) was used to address the statistical significance of these results .
Nucleotide sequence accession number .
The GenBank accession number M27161 has been assigned to the human CD8a intron sequence .
RESULTS Mapping of DNase I HS .
The first step towards an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in CD8 gene regulation requires the identification of cis-acting DNA regulatory elements .
In many developmentally regulated and tissue-specific genes such as CD8 , DNase I HS have been associated with regions active in transcriptional control , and Vor .
13 , 1993 their appearance has been correlated with both gene expression and the binding of trans-acting regulatory factors ( 2 , 4 , 26 , 27 , 30 , 33 , 69 , 82 , 83 ) .
To locate regions potentially accessible to DNA-binding proteins , the chromatin structure surrounding the human CD8a gene was mapped for sites that are hypersensitive to digestion with DNase I .
In order to identify tissue-specific DNase I HS , two human leukemic T-cell lines , HPB.ALL ( CD8a « *B* CD4* ) and Jurkat ( CD87 CD4* ) , as well as control non-T -cell lines , Raji ( an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line ) and HeLa ( a fibroblast cell line ) , were analyzed .
DNA was prepared from DNase I-digested nuclei , restricted with HindIII , electrophoresed , blotted , and hybridized to a 762-bp HindIII-PstI 5° probe which detects a 14-kb genomic band in HindIII-digested DNA from untreated nuclei .
By using this approach , four subfragments representing distinct DNase I HS were identified ( Fig .
1 ) .
HS1 , found in both T-and non-T-cell lines , mapped to the intron between exons IV and V , while HS2 and HS3 , found in the last intron , appear exclusively in T cells .
The intensity and broadness of HS3 , the most predominant T-cell-specific site identified , may reflect the presence of multiple HS sites in this region .
HS4 , located downstream of the last exon , is also very prominent in the two T-cell lines , less prominent in the B-cell line , and absent in the fibroblast cell line .
A computer-assisted search of the known human CDSa genomic sequence ( 57 ) for potential transcription factor binding sites ( 17 ) revealed a striking cluster of consensus motifs for DNA-binding proteins near the location of HS2 and HS3 within the last intron .
Many of these motifs are homologous to those found in the tissue-specific regulatory regions of other T-cell-specific genes ( 20 , 23 , 31 , 38 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 51 , 64-66 , 74 , 76 , 81 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1A and C , putative DNA-binding sites for GATA-3 ( 37 ) , TCF-1 ( 45 , 79 ) , Ets-1 ( 80 ) , and LyF-1 ( 47 ) ( two sites ) were identified within a 700-bp region of this last intron ( see Fig .
5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 for consensus sequences for each motif ) .
In addition , a potential cyclic AMP response element ( CRE ) ( 11 , 21 , 39 , 43 , 65 ) and a binding site for a bHLH protein ( 28 , 54 , 55 , 61 ) were found within this region ( see Table 2 and Fig .
5 to 8 for consensus sequences for each motif ) .
We also found a full-length Alu repeat next to an inverted half-4/u repeat .
The full-length Alu sequence contained the binding sites for GATA-3 , LyF-1 , and bHLH proteins .
Nucleotide sequence of the intronic region containing the putative transcription factor binding sites and the AZu repeats is shown in Fig .
1C .
A T-cell-specific enhancer resides in the last intron of the human CDS8 « gene .
The correlation between the appearance of a strong T-cell-specific HS and the location of several consensus motifs suggested that a tissue-specific regulatory region resides within the last intron of the CD8a « gene .
To determine whether a transcriptional enhancer element was present within the last intron , a 1,149-bp fragment generated by SphI-XmnI double digestion was subcloned into an expression vector ( pTKLux ) in which the firefly luciferase reporter gene is driven by a minimal heterologous promoter element from the herpes simplex virus TK gene .
Recombi-nant plasmids with this CDS8a « intronic fragment inserted in both orientations ( + and - ) , both upstream ( pTKCD8U-and pTKCD8U+ ) and downstream ( pTKCD8D- and pTKCD8D+ ) of the TK promoter , as well as the pTKLux parent plasmid lacking this CD8 fragment , were independently transfected into a panel of T- and non-T-cell lines and assayed for luciferase activity 40 to 48 h later .
This CD8a intronic fragment enhanced expression by the TK promoter by 15- to 30-fold in the T-cell lines Jurkat ( CD87 CD4* ) and Alu-CONTAINING T-CELL-SPECIFIC CD8 « ENHANCER 7059 JM ( CD8a*B~ CD4* ) but had no effect on expression in two non-T-cell lines , Raji and HeLa ( Fig .
2 ) .
The results also demonstrate that the last intron contains an enhancer element that functions in an orientation- and position-independent fashion and may play a role in directing T-cell-specific expression of the CD8a gene .
Delineation of the minimal enhancer element .
In order to define the boundaries of the minimal enhancer element , deletions from the 3 ' and 5'° ends of the 1,149-bp CD8 intronic enhancer fragment were generated ( see Fig .
3A for location of each deletion ) and tested for enhancer activity by using the reporter-based transient expression system .
As shown in Fig .
3B and C , these constructs produced similar results when tested in two T-cell lines , JM and Jurkat , but were not active in non-T-cell lines ( data not shown ) .
Removal of up to 280 bp from the 3 ' end of this fragment ( deletion constructs p3 ' A-95 , p3 ' A-219 , p3 ' A-250 , and p3 ' A-280 ) did not significantly affect enhancer activity ( Fig .
3B ) .
However , further deletion of 52 bp ( p3 ' A-332 ) , including DNA sequences containing the putative Ets binding site , dramatically reduced enhancer activity .
Truncation of an additional 178 bp ( p3 ' A-510 ) resulted in total loss of activity .
The site of the 280-bp deletion in the plasmid p3'A280 therefore represents the 3 ' boundary of this T-cell-specific enhancer .
Analysis of deletion constructs from the 5 ' end of the 1,149-bp enhancer fragment revealed a more complicated set of results ( Fig .
3C ) .
Whereas deletion of 18 bp ( pS ' A-18 ) was inconsequential , loss of 203 or 204 bp ( pS and pS ' A-204 , respectively ) encompassing the entire half-4/u repeat significantly augmented the strength of this enhancer by an additional fivefold .
Although this result suggests that a negative regulatory element is present in this half-4/u repeat at the 5 ' end of the 1,149-bp fragment , this sequence did not have any effect when added back to p5 ' A-203 downstream of the simian virus 40 polyadenylation/splice signal ( data not shown ) , indicating that the position of this region is critical for its negative effect on the adjacent enhancer .
The deletion construct p5 ' A-290 , which lacks 290 bp of sequence from the 5 ' end , including the putative GATA-3 binding site , demonstrated less activity than either pS5 ' A-203 or p5 ' A-204 but functioned as well as pTKCD8U- ( containing the full-length 1,149-bp fragment ) .
Further truncation of an additional 99 bp ( pS A-389 ) including the putative upstream LyF-1 site ( LyF-1u ) resulted in almost complete loss of enhancer activity .
These results suggest the 5 ' border of the intronic region possessing maximal enhancer activity is delimited at the 203-or 204-bp deletion site .
Subsequently , the minimal T-cell-specific enhancer fragment with maximal activity was further localized to a 653-bp fragment defined at the 3 ' end by the 280-bp deletion site and the 5 end by a THh1111 site representing a deletion of 216 bp ( see Fig .
4 for location of deletion sites ) .
The resulting plasmid containing this 653-bp fragment , pTKCD8min , was as active in T-cell lines as either pS A-203 or p5 ' A-204 in the transient transfection assay ( data not shown ) .
However , this minimal enhancer was not active in the B-lymphoblastoid line Raji .
Thus , this 653-bp fragment , containing the putative nuclear protein binding sites for GATA-3 , LyF-1 ( two sites ) , bHLH , TCF-1 , CRE , and Ets-1 , represents the core CD8a enhancer which possesses T-cell-specific activity .
Mutational analysis of the minimal CD8 enhancer .
In order to determine the functional importance of each of the putative nuclear protein binding sites in the CD8a « enhancer , a series of site-directed mutants were generated and tested for their effects on enhancer activity in both JM and Jurkat T 7060 HAMBOR ET AL .

While mutation of the putative core sequences in individual binding sites for GATA-3 , LyF-1u ( upstream site ) , LyF-1d ( downstream site ) , bHLH , CRE , and TCF-1 resulted in incomplete but significant ( 12 to 60 % ) reductions in enhancer activity , mutation of the core sequence for the putative Ets binding site was most deleterious to enhancer function .
Analysis of these single-site mutants indicated that the function of the minimal enhancer is most dramatically affected by mutation of either the putative GATA-3 or Ets-1 DNA motifs which are located at either end of the minimal enhancer fragment .
This finding is consistent with that of the deletion analysis , which demonstrated a dramatic decline in enhancer activity upon removal of sequences containing either the putative GATA-3 or Ets-1 binding sites .
Since other enhancer regions have been shown to be composed of functionally redundant cis-acting elements , the contribution of each binding site was further studied by using a combinational mutagenesis approach in which a series of double mutants were produced ( Fig .
4 ) .
The activity of the enhancer was nearly ablated when dual mutations were Vor .

introduced into the GATA-3/LyF-lu , LyF-lu/LyF-1d , and bHLH/LyF-1d sites .
A significant loss of enhancer function was also observed in bHLH/TCF-1 and bHLH/CRE double mutants , whereas mutational combinations of the LyF-lu/ bHLH , LyF-1u/CRE , LyF-1d/ITCF-1 , and LyF-1d/CRE sites had very little effect compared with single mutants for each individual site .
The results of this mutational analysis indicate that a functional hierarchy exists among the putative cis-acting elements , with the Ets-1 and GATA-3 sites appearing most important to CD8 « intronic enhancer function in the T-cell lines that were analyzed .
Characterization of nuclear proteins binding to individual cis-acting elements within the CD8 « enhancer by EMSA .
To further characterize individual protein binding sites within the minimal CD8a « enhancer , EMSA were performed with oligonucleotides corresponding to the LyF-1 , TCF-1 , GATA-3 , and Ets-1 binding sites .
Protein-DNA complexes , formed by incubation of labeled synthetic oligonucleotides with nuclear extracts from both T- and non-T-cell lines , were resolved by using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .
In each case , specific protein-DNA interactions were identified by the ability to block complex formation with competing wild-type oligonucleotides but not with mutant oligonucleotides .
These mutant oligonucleotides , containing changes in the consensus core motif for each binding site , were identical to those previously used in the mutational analysis of the minimal CD8a enhancer ( see above ) .
The DNA-binding protein LyF-1 , shown to interact with the core consensus sequence 5'-YYTGGGAGR-3 ' ( Interna-tional Union of Biochemistry [ IUB ] nucleotide code ) , has been implicated as a general transcription factor for genes whose expression is restricted to the lymphoid lineages ( 47 ) .
Sequence comparison of the putative upstream and downstream LyF-1 sites ( LyF-1u and LyF-1d , respectively ) in the CD8a enhancer revealed a high degree of homology with one another as well as with previously described LyF-1 sites in the promoters and enhancers of other lymphoid cell-specific genes ( Fig .

Orientation and position independence of the T-cell-specific CD8a intronic enhancer .
( A ) The 1,149-bp Sp/hI-XmnI fragment from the last intron of the human CD8 « gene ( black box ; see Fig .
1A for fragment origin ) was subcloned into the luciferase-reporter plasmid pTKLux in both orientations ( - and + ; note arrows over the black enhancer box ) both upstream ( U ) and downstream ( D ) of a minimal heterologous promoter from the herpes simplex virus TK gene ( open box with arrowhead ) .
In all of the constructs , the firefly luciferase gene ( speckled box ) is used as a reporter gene whose mRNA is stabilized by a polyadenylation/splice signal from the simian virus 40 ( cross-hatched box ) .
( B ) JM ( G2 ) , Jurkat , Raji , and HeLa cells were cotransfected with the above constructs and with the plasmid pCMVB-gal and then assayed for both B-galactosidase and luciferase activities 40 to 48 h later .
To adjust for differences in transfection efficiencies , luciferase values were standardized to B-galactosidase values .
Relative activities of plasmids with the 1,149-bp CD8 fragment ( pTKCD8U- , pTKCD8D+ , and pTKCD8D- ) were determined by normalizing these standardized values to pTKLux .
probe containing the LyF-1d site with nuclear extracts from the T-cell lines Molt4 , Jurkat , and HPB.ALL , as well as from the B-cell line Raji ( data not shown ) , but not from the nonlymphoid cell lines HeLa and HepG2 , resulted in the formation of a single protein-DNA complex ( Fig .
5 ) .
The formation of this complex was effectively prevented by the addition of excess unlabeled specific competitor oligonucleotides containing the wild-type LyF-1d motif ( Fig .
5 , lane 7 ) but not by an excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides in which the LyF-1d site had been mutated ( Fig .
5 , lane 8 ) .
EMSA using a labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the LyF-1u site also produced a similar protein-DNA complex that could be specifically inhibited by the wild-type , but not the mutant , LyF-1u oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the LyF-lu and LyF-1d sites could cross-compete in these assays , indicating that each site was binding a common protein ( data not shown ) .
Two distinct lymphoid cell-restricted transcription factors , TCF-1 and TCF-la « ( or LEF-1 ) , have been reported to bind to an identical pyrimidine-rich sequence ( 5'-Y¥CTCTK WW-3 ' ; IUB nucleotide code ) found in the enhancers of a number of lymphoid cell-specific genes ( 45 , 79 ) .
Examination of the CD8a enhancer revealed a homologous sequence which could function as a TCF-1 binding site ( Fig .
6 ) .
EMSA using an oligonucleotide from the CD8a « enhancer containing the putative TCF-1 site demonstrated that nuclear extracts from the T-cell lines Molt4 , HPB.ALL , JM ( G2 ) , and Jurkat contained two DNA-binding activities with different electrophoretic mobilities resulting in the resolution of two distinct bands ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , only the lower band representing a faster mobility complex was formed with nuclear extracts from the non-T-cell lines HeLa ( Fig .
6 , lane 5 ) and Raji ( data not shown ) .
Competition experiments using unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild-type and mutant TCF-1 sites demonstrated that the slower mobility complex ( upper band ; see arrow in Fig .
6 ) contained a specific DNA-binding activity that was present only in T-cell nuclear extracts .
The lower band represents a nonspecific DNA-binding activity that was present in all nuclear extracts tested ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the specific DNA-protein complex represented by the upper band could be inhibited by a previously described oligonucleotide ( 79 ) from the CD3s enhancer ( MWS56 ) which contains a TCF-1 site ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the CD8 « enhancer contains a TCF-1 binding site which is equivalent to the one found in the CD3s enhancer .
The CD8 « enhancer also contains a consensus motif ( 5'-WGATAR-3 ' ; IUB nucleotide code ) for a GATA binding protein .
A T-cell-restricted GATA binding protein , GATA-3 , has been shown to specifically bind to this motif ( 37 ) .
EMSA using a labeled oligonucleotide containing the GATA-3 motif revealed a very slow mobility complex ( see arrow in Fig .
7 ) which only formed with the addition of nuclear extracts from T-cell lines Jurkat , Molt4 , JM ( G2 ) , and HPB.ALL .

Site-directed mutagenesis of the minimal CD8a « enhancer .
The minimal CD8 « enhancer ( pTKCD $ 8 min ) , defined on the 5 ' end by a Tth1111 site representing deletion of 216 bp and on the 3 ' end by a 3 ' A-280 site representing deletion of 280 bp , is depicted at the top of the figure .
Also shown are the consensus nucleoprotein binding motifs .
The 653-bp minimal enhancer fragments which have wild-type ( open box ) or mutant ( solid box ) nuclear protein binding sites were inserted upstream of the herpes simplex virus TK promoter in its native 5'-to-3 ' orientation in the luciferase-reporter plasmid pTKLux .
The sequences of the mutant oligomers used to introduce these site-directed changes into the minimal enhancer are depicted in Fig .
5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 and also in Table 2 .
Both single and double mutants were generated .
JM ( G2 ) and Jurkat T-cell lines were cotransfected with the mutant reporter constructs and the reference plasmid pCMVB-gal .
Relative activity was determined by normalizing standardized values to pTKCD8min ( set at a value of 100 ) .
competition assays ( Fig .
7 , lanes 7 , 8 , and 9 ) demonstrated that this more slowly migrating complex contains a GATA binding protein specific for the GATA site , since formation of this complex was inhibited only by the wild-type GATA oligomer .
Two faster-migrating , nonspecific complexes were also observed in all cell lines examined that were not inhibited by the wild-type GATA oligomer .
These results demonstrate that the consensus GATA-3 site in the CD8a enhancer specifically binds a T-cell-restricted nuclear factor .
The Ets-l proto-oncogene , which encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that recognizes the consensus motif 5'-RRSMGGAWVWR-3 ' ( IUB nucleotide code ) , is preferentially expressed in thymocytes , T cells , and B cells ( 45 ) .
This motif , found in the enhancers of other T-cell-specific genes ( 80 ) , is also present in the CD8 « enhancer .
A cluster of three T-cell-restricted DNA-protein complexes was formed with nuclear extracts from the T-cell lines Jurkat , Molt4 , JIM ( G2 ) , and HPB.ALL ( see bracketed bands in Fig .
8 ) , but not from the nonlymphoid cell lines HeLa and HepG2 or from the B-cell line Raji ( data not shown ) .
The formation of this cluster of complexes could be inhibited by a competitor oligonucleotide containing an Ets-1 consensus sequence , but not by a related oligonucleotide in which the Ets-1 motif was mutated .
It is unclear whether the observed cluster of DNA-protein complexes represents the modification or degradation of a single nucleoprotein or the binding of three unique nucleoproteins .
Thus , the Ets-1 motif in the CD8a enhancer also appears to function as a binding site for T-cell-specific nuclear factors .
The enhancer is partially composed of an A/z repeat .
Sequence analysis revealed an Alu repeat at the 5 ' end of the minimal enhancer ( Fig .
1 ) .
A comparison of this sequence with known Alu consensus sequences ( 71 ) indicated that there is 96 % homology to the precise consensus , with nucleotide changes at only 12 positions ( Fig .
9 ) .
Alu family members with characteristics of the precise consensus are believed to have been more recently inserted into the ge-nome .

Alignment of A4/u consensus sequences with the A4/z sequences in the CD8a intronic enhancer .
Alu consensus sequences representing major , polymorphic variant ( PV ) , and precise subfamily members ( 71 ) , as well as the full-length and half-4/u sequences , in the CD8 intronic enhancer are shown .
Dots indicate identical nucleotides , and dashes correspond to gaps or deletions .
The insertion of three nucleotides ( ~ATT ) into the CD8 half-4/u sequence at position 142 is indicated .
The consensus binding sites for LyF-1 , bHLH , and GATA-3 proteins are shown in boldface type and have been aligned to the Alu consensus sequences .
( greater than 90 % homology ) under some circumstances .
The formation of such a secondary structure may account for the apparent silencer activity we detected when we removed the half-4/u repeat during our deletional analysis ( Fig .
3C ) .
This would be consistent with the finding that the fragment did not display silencer activity when placed at a distance from the enhancer ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION In this report , we identified a prominent tissue-restricted DNase I HS in the last intron of the human CD8a gene and found that a fragment containing this site exhibited the properties of a T-cell-specific transcriptional enhancer .
We found a number of protein binding sites ( Ets-1 , GATA-3 , LyF-1 , TCF-1 , CRE , and bHLH ) and demonstrated a functional role for these elements in both a nucleoprotein binding assay ( EMSA ) and a reporter-based expression assay by using site-directed mutagenesis of the consensus protein binding site for each motif .
A minimal 653-bp enhancer with maximal activity was delimited on the 5¢ and 3 ' ends by consensus GATA-3 and Ets-1 binding sites , respectively , both of which were critical for enhancer function .
In addition , we found that the 5 ' portion of the minimal enhancer encoded an Alu repeat which contained four consensus motifs for DNA-binding proteins .
Deletion experiments suggested that a negative regulatory element containing at least half of an Alu repeat is adjacent to the minimal enhancer .
Taken together , our results indicate that the CD8a « enhancer described in this study is a complex transcriptional regulatory element that potentially contributes to the T-cell specificity of human CD8a gene expression .
The existence of an Alu repeat within the enhancer indicates the potential role of Alu sequences in cell-specific regulation .
While the function of Alu sequences is largely unknown , there are accumulating examples of their role in gene regulation ( 6 , 34 , 67 ) .
For instance , DNA-binding proteins are known to bind to Alu repeats ( 6 , 9 , 78 ) .
Some characterized regulatory elements , such as a positive and a negative element in the promoter of the y chain subunit of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor , contain parts of Alu repeats ( 6 ) .
The insertion of Alu repeats into or near a gene , such as occurred in the CD8 gene , may contribute to the evolution of regulatory elements controlling the expression of that gene .
Because Alu repeats are found only in primate species , it would imply that the existence of this regulatory element within the CD8a intron would be restricted to primates .
In fact , this is supported by sequence comparisons performed between human and murine sequences in the last intron of the CD8a gene ( data not shown ) which showed no homology in the region of the human enhancer .
In addition , we searched the murine intron for the presence of the protein binding motifs that we found in the human intron and did not find any of these sites .
Therefore , we propose that insertion of the Alu sequences apparently contributed to the evolution of this regulatory element .
A detailed comparison of all the characterized T-cell-specific enhancers , including the human CD8a « enhancer identified in this study , revealed that many are patchwork composed of a mutual set of nuclear protein binding sites for GATA , TCF , Ets , CREB/ATF , and bHLH proteins ( 20 , 23 , 31 , 38 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 51 , 64-66 , 74 , 76 , 81 ) .
Thus , it seems likely that a consortium of a relatively limited number of 7068 HAMBOR ET AL .
transcription factors , many exclusively found in T cells , may coordinately regulate the expression of multiple T-cell genes .
Although tied together by this common thread , each regulatory region is organized into a unique pattern of cis-acting elements .
Cross-talk amongst an assemblage of trans-acting factors , determined to a certain extent by the geometric spacing of the cis elements , as well as the interaction affinity of each cis element with related or posttran-scriptionally modified members of an individual transcription factor gene family , could ultimately influence the temporal and spatial expression of individual T-cell-specific genes and potentiate differential gene expression during T-cell development and activation .
For instance , the relative location of TCF-1 , a protein capable of bending DNA ( 22 ) , may be critical for determining what types of protein-protein interactions may occur within an enhancer .
While the importance of some motifs such as GATA-3 and Ets-1 were apparent from single-site mutations , the functional importance of the binding motifs for the LyF-1 , TCF-1 , CRE , and bHLH nucleoproteins only became apparent when mutations in these sites were analyzed in pairs .
This finding suggests that the CD8a enhancer , like other T-cell-specific enhancers , is composed of a set of partially redundant cis-acting elements which are able to compensate for the functional loss of other individual elements .
Alternatively , the functional importance of these individual elements may change during T-cell differentiation or activation , since it has been shown that the genes for these lymphoid-restricted transcription factors are first expressed at different periods of thymocyte development ( 10 , 45 , 79 ) .
Since we have thus far characterized previously described protein binding motifs , the existence of additional cis-acting elements in the CD8a « enhancer remains a distinct possibil-ity .
Indeed , preliminary DNase I footprint analysis allowed the identification of a protected region close to , but not encompassing , the TCF-1 consensus motif ( data not shown ) .
To the best of our knowledge , this sequence does not conform to any previously described cis-acting element and therefore may represent a binding site for a novel transacting factor .
In this study , we have investigated the properties of a CD8a « enhancer that is active in all T-cell lines tested , including the Jurkat T-cell line , which does not express the endogenous CD8 « gene .
The fact that the intronic region containing the CD8a « enhancer is hypersensitive to DNase I digestion in Jurkat cells suggests that this enhancer is poised to receive the proper trans-regulatory information .
While it is unknown why Jurkat cells do not express their endogenous CD8a gene , it is possible that the activity of this enhancer in Jurkat cells may reflect an abnormal property of this cell line .
It is plausible that the endogenous CD8a enhancer or some other important endogenous regulatory region ( such as the promoter ) is defective in Jurkat cells .
Alternatively , the CD8a enhancer may be inactivated by a negative regulator , in addition to the adjoining silencer element , which is missing in the reporter-based plasmids .
The latter possibility is particularly appealing , since an additional silencer element outside of the TCRa enhancer was recently shown to down-regulate the function of the TCRa enhancer in T cells of the y8 lineage ( 81 ) .
Thus , additional cis-acting elements may be required to fine-tune expression of the CD8a gene in specific T-cell subsets .
While this initial characterization of the CD8a « intronic enhancer will significantly facilitate future studies , many unanswered questions remain .

How are these cis-acting elements able to mediate temporal signals during the process of thymic differentiation ?
Once all of the cis-regulatory elements have been identified and characterized , a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing CD8a gene expression will be possible .
