We investigated the role of this G+C-rich region in augmenting a-globin promoter activity in the presence of the far-upstream -globin enhancer , HS-40 .
We show that in transiently transfected erythroid cells , deletion of the « -globin G+C-rich 5 ' flanking region has no effect on a-globin promoter activity .
However , upon stable integration into chromatin , deletion of this region causes a nearly 90 % decrease in promoter activity compared with expression from an a-globin promoter retaining this region .
These results suggest that the -globin G+C-rich 5 ' flanking region augments a-globin promoter activity in a chromatin-dependent manner .
We further show that this G+C-rich region is required for the activation of -globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .
Finally , we show by both footprint analysis and functional assays that the ability of the G+C-rich region to increase -globin promoter activity from a stably integrated -globin gene is mediated by its multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 .
The human a-globin gene cluster lies within an early replicating G+C-rich isochore close to the telomere of the short arm of chromosome 16 .
It consists of three functional genes arranged 5'- { 2-a2-a1-3 ' .
As with the -globin genes , the « -like globin genes are erythroid specific .
However , they are structurally quite different to the -globin genes in that they are highly G+C rich , associated with CpG islands , and lack scaffold-associated regions ( for review , see ref .
1 ) .
High-level expression of genes within the -globin gene cluster is dependent upon sequences located far upstream from the « -globin gene cluster .
An erythroid-specific DNase 1-hypersensitive site located 40 kb upstream of the { -globin gene ( HS-40 ) confers high levels of erythroid-specific expression to a linked a- or { -globin gene in stably integrated erythroid cells or transgenic mice ( 2-5 ) .
Interestingly , HS-40 lies within an intron of a widely expressed gene of unknown function ( 6 ) .
The 5 ' flanking region of the « -globin gene contains multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 and is associated with a CpG island ( 6 , 7 ) .
CpG islands in general have a chromatin structure different from that of bulk chromatin in that they are deficient in histone H1 , contain hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4 , and include nucleosome-free segments of DNA ( 8 ) .
It therefore seems plausible that this G+C-rich 5° flanking region may be important for high-level expression from an « -globin gene stably integrated into chromatin .
In this study , we have examined the role played by this highly G+C-rich 5 ' flanking region in « -globin gene expression upon erythroid differentiation .
In addition , we have characterized specific nuclear regulatory proteins in erythroid cells that interact with this region .

7237 MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Constructs .
All DNA constructs employed in this study are depicted in Fig .
1C .
The constructs -750/CAT , -267/CAT , -85/CAT , and -55/CAT contain 750 , 267 , 85 , and 55 bp , respectively , of « -globin 5 ' flanking region ( cap = 0 ) in the Bg II site of the plasmid pSVOCAT ( 9 ) .
The plasmid ~750*/CAT ( CCAAT box mutant ) was produced by digesting the plasmid -750/CAT with Nae I and Eag I .
The plasmid was purified and ligated with a Nae I-Hinfl and a Hinfl-Eag I a-globin promoter fragment containing a mutated CCAAT box ( CCAAT to CGAGT ) .
The plasmids Sp1/-85/CAT and Sp1*/-85/CAT were produced by digesting the plasmid -750/CAT with Nde I and Sma 1 .
The ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and ligated with a 19-mer oligonucleotide containing either an Spl ( based on simian virus 40 ori se-quences ) or mutant Spl binding site ( GGAACTGGGCGG-AGTTAGG or GGAACTGGGATGAGTTAGG ) .
A total of six wild-type or mutant Spl binding sites were put into each plasmid .
To produce a-globin promoter/CAT constructs containing HS-40 and/or Neo , a 4.0-kb BamHI fragment containing HS-40 and/or an EcoR I-BamHI fragment containing a simian virus 40 promoter linked to a Neo gene were ligated to a BamHI recognition site and/or a blunt-ended Pvu I recognition site of each construct .
Tissue Culture , Cell Transfection , and CAT Assays .
Putko , murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) 585 , and MEL 707 cells were maintained as described ( 10 ) .
K562 cells were maintained as above , except that 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal calf serum was employed .
Putko and MEL cells were electroporated with 0.75-50 ug of DNA as described ( 10 ) .
K562 cells were transfected as above , employing a current of 1.2 kV and 25 uF .
To generate stable lines , cells were transfected as above .
Forty-eight hours after transfection , cells were placed in selection medium containing 1.0 mg of G418 per ml .
Individual clones or pools of G418-resistant clones were then employed for CAT analysis To induce terminal erythroid differentiation , MEL cells were exposed to 5 mM hexamethylenebisacetamide ( HMBA ) and 25 uM hemin for a period of 60-72 h. All CAT assays and cotransfection controls were performed according to Pondel et al .
( 10 ) .
Copy Number Analysis .
To determine a-globin promoter/ CAT/HS-40 copy number in cell clones , DNA was isolated according to Maniatis et al .
( 11 ) and subjected to Southern blot analysis by employing a 4.0-kb BamHI HS-40 DNA fragment as a probe .
Copy number was quantitated as described ( 4 ) .
DNase Protection Studies .
Probes for these studies were prepared by digesting a plasmid containing the -globin promoter with either Nae I or Eag I , followed by incorporation of an a-P-labeled nucleotide with the Klenow enzyme .
A total of 10 fmol of purified probe was used in a reaction as described by Murphy et al .

RESULTS Comparison of a-Globin Promoter Activity in Transient Versus Stable Erythroid Cell Transfections .
To characterize specific elements in the a-globin promoter that are required for its high-level activity , a series of hybrid a-globin/CAT constructs were produced ( Fig .
1C ) .
We began our analysis by transiently transfecting three constructs ( -750/CAT/HS-40 , -85/CAT/HS-40 , and -55/CAT/HS-40 ) into MEL cells .
These cells can be induced with the drug HMBA to undergo terminal differentiation into erythroid cells and subsequently show a 10- to 20-fold increase in endogenous -globin expression ( 14-16 ) .
We previously showed that HS-40 can activate a-globin promoter activity in transiently transfected erythroid cells ( 10 ) .
In the absence of HMBA , cells transfected with the above constructs displayed similarly low levels of CAT expression ( Fig .
24 ) .
Following 60 h of exposure to HMBA , CAT expression from MEL cells transiently transfected with -750/ CAT /HS-40 or -85/CAT/HS-40 increased on average 8-fold .
CAT expression from -55/CAT/HS-40 , however , increased only 3- to 4-fold .
When these constructs were transiently Sp1*/-85/CAT 5 ' flanking region relative to the cap site is indicated .
transfected into the human erythroid-like Putko cell line , expression from both -750/CAT/HS-40 and -85/CAT/ HS-40 was similar , whereas expression from the -55/CAT/ HS-40 construct was 75 % lower than expression from the above constructs .
In the absence of HS-40 , expression from all constructs was close to background levels ( data not shown ) .
All the above results suggest that in transiently transfected cells , the a-globin CCAAT and TATA boxes , in conjunction with HS-40 , mediate high levels of « -globin expression upon erythroid differentiation .
When the above and additional constructs were stably integrated into MEL cells , CAT expression prior to induction with HMBA was similarly low for all constructs ( Fig .
2B ) .
Following a 72-h exposure to HMBA , CAT expression from -750/CAT/HS-40/Neo in pools of stable integrants increased on average 16-fold .
However , expression from -85/ CAT/HS-40/Neo increased slightly less than 2-fold .
CAT expression from -55/CAT/HS-40/Neo was no longer inducible with HMBA .
When these constructs were stably integrated into the human erythroid-like line K562 , CAT expression from -750/ CAT /HS-40/Neo was , on average , 9-fold higher than expression from the -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct .
Expression from the -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo was 3-fold higher than expression from the -55/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct ( Fig .
2D ) .
Primer extension analysis on RNA from the above stable cell pools showed that transcription from these constructs initiated at the correct start site ( data not shown ) .
In the absence of HS-40 , no significant level of CAT expression from any of these constructs was detected ( Fig .
2D ) .
CAT expression from the construct -267/CAT/HS-40/ Neo in stably integrated MEL cells was similar to that of Genetics : Pondel et al .

Data represent an average from two independent experiments .

Data represent an average from four independent pools of stable clones ( > 100 clones per pool ) per construct .
-750/CAT/HS-40/Neo ( Fig .
2B ) .
This construct is identical to -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo but retains a 190-bp G+C-rich region containing multiple Spl-binding sites .
When the CCAAT box in -750/CAT/HS-40/Neo was mutated , CAT expression from pools of stable MEL cell integrants increased 4-fold following induction with HMBA ( Fig .
2B ) .
It was possible that the similar levels of expression from -750/CAT/HS-40 and -85/CAT/HS-40 in transiently but not stably transfected cells were an artifact due to the large amount of DNA employed in the transient transfections ( 50 ug ) .
We therefore transfected significantly lower concentrations of these constructs ( 0.75 , 1.5 , or 3.75 ug ) into Putko cells and performed CAT assays 48 h after transfection .
Putko cells were chosen for this experiment since we have found that they transfect with higher efficiency than MEL cells .
The results showed that when as little as 0.75 ug of construct DNA was transiently transfected , CAT expression levels from both -85/ CAT/HS-40 and -750/CAT/HS-40 were similar ( Fig .
2C ) .
The above results suggest that upon stable integration into chromatin , the « -globin CCAAT and TATA boxes are necessary but not sufficient for optimal levels of inducible « -globin promoter activity .
A combination of the CCAAT and TATA boxes , together with a 190-bp G+C-rich 5 ' flanking region Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 92 ( 1995 ) 7239 containing multiple Spl-binding sites , is sufficient for full -globin promoter activity .
The above results also suggest that episomal expression of -globin CAT constructs somehow bypasses the requirement of the G+C-rich region for full -globin promoter activity .
Clonal Analysis of « -Globin Promoter Activity .
In all the above analyses of stably transfected a-globin promoter/CAT/ HS-40/Neo constructs , we have assumed that analyzing complex pools of K562 or MEL cell clones truly reflects the mean activity of individual clones .
To test this assumption we analyzed CAT expression from 10 individual clones of MEL cells stably transfected with either a -750/CAT/HS-40 or a -85/CAT/HS-40/ Neo construct .
Following exposure to HMBA , CAT activity from clones containing the -750/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct increased 11- to 22-fold ( average of 16-fold ) compared to a 0- to 8-fold ( average of 3-fold ) induction from clones containing the -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct ( Fig .
3 ) .
Overall expression levels were on average 10-fold higher from clones containing the -750/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct compared with those containing the -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct .
These results are similar to what we observed in complex pools of clones containing these constructs .
However , greater variability in induction levels of CAT activity was observed from clones containing the -85/ CAT construct ( 0- to 8-fold ) compared with that seen from clones containing the -750/CAT/HS-40 construct ( 11- to 20-fold ) .
Overall CAT expression levels also appeared to be more variable from clones transfected with the -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct compared with those transfected with the -750/CAT/ HS-40/Neo construct .
These results suggest that deletion of the G+C-rich region 5 ' of the -globin CCAAT box not only reduces -globin promoter activity but may also increase variability of induction and expression between clones , possibly due to the effect position of integration has on expression from the -85/ CAT /HS-40/Neo construct .
Characterization of Transcription Factors Interacting with the 190-bp G+C-Rich a-Globin 5° Flanking Region .
The results above suggested that a 190-bp G+C-rich region 5 ' to a-globin 's CCAAT box may be an important regulator of a-globin expression in stably integrated chromatin .
To study the interaction of this region with nuclear regulatory factors , in vitro footprint analysis was carried out on a 210-bp Nae I-Eag | a-globin promoter fragment ( Fig .
1B ) .
Whitelaw et al .
( 17 ) showed that this region binds Sp1 in gel-shift assays .
To identify the specific regions of this flanking region capable of binding Sp1 , we first footprinted the region by using recombinant Sp1 .
Analysis on both coding ( Fig .
4B ) and noncoding strands ( Fig .
44 ) indicated four clearly protected regions .

sites , and the other region contains two closely spaced CAC boxes .
One additional Sp1l-consensus site and a nonconsensus site also bound Sp1 but not as strongly as the other sites , while another Sp1-consensus site showed no detectable Sp1 binding .
The presence of a 100-fold molar excess of nonspecific competitor had no effect on footprints ( Fig .
4B , lane 7 ) .
However , addition of the same amount of an oligonucleotide containing the consensus Spl-binding site resulted in a pattern indistinguishable from that observed when no Sp1 was added ( Fig .
4B , lane 8 ) .
When the 210-bp G+C-rich region was footprinted with MEL cell nuclear extracts , a pattern similar to that seen with recombinant Spl was obtained ( Fig .
4C ) .
However , the consensus and nonconsensus sites that weakly bound recombinant Sp1 did not appear to footprint with MEL extracts .
As before , the addition of specific ( Fig .
4C , lane 5 ) but not nonspecific competitor ( Fig .
4C , lane 4 ) resulted in a pattern indistinguishable from that observed when no extract was added ( Fig .
4C , lane 2 ) .
The large protected region from -62 to -90 corresponds to the CCAAT box , already known to bind Cpl ( 18 ) .

Although it is possible that a transcription factor other than Sp1 may be responsible for the footprints we observe with MEL cell extract , preliminary data employing anti-Spl antibodies suggest this is not the case ( data not shown ) .
The results of our footprint analysis , therefore , suggest that the only detectable nuclear regulatory factor in MEL cells binding to a-globin 's 190-bp G+C-rich region is Sp1 .

Addition of Spl Binding Sites to a Minimal « -Globin Promoter Reconstitutes High Levels of Inducible a-Globin Promoter Activity .
To provide functional evidence for the role of Sp1 in high level « -globin promoter activity , we constructed a modified -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct in which six synthetic Sp1 or mutant Sp1 binding sites were cloned 5 ' to the « -globin CCAAT box ( see Fig .
1C ) .
This methodology was employed rather than mutating all consensus and nonconsensus Spi-binding sites in the 5 ' flanking region since this would require extensive mutagenesis of the entire region .
In addition , due to the G+C richness of the region , it is likely that other potential Sp1-binding sites not detected in our footprint analysis are present .

Data represent an average from four independent pools of stable clones ( > 100 clones per pool ) per construct .
CAT/HS-40 and -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo constructs , were stably transfected into MEL cells , and expression levels were analyzed from complex pools of G418-resistant cell clones .
Fig .
5 shows that CAT expression data from pools of clones containing the Sp1/-85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct gave as high a level of inducible « -globin promoter activity as cells transfected with the -750/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct .
In contrast , the mutant Sp1*/-85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct gave 83-86 % lower levels of expression , similar to that seen from the -85/CAT/HS-40/Neo construct .
These results strongly suggest that the multiple Sp1-binding sites in the 190-bp G+C-rich region of the -globin promoter are crucial for high-level -globin promoter activity from a stably integrated a-globin construct .
DISCUSSION In this report , we show that maximum a-globin promoter activity from a stably integrated a-globin construct linked to HS-40 requires a 190-bp G+C-rich region located immediately 5 ' to the « -globin CCAAT box .
Promoter activity from a stably integrated construct that lacks this region increased less than 2-fold following HMBA-induced MEL cell differentiation .
By comparison , a-globin promoter activity from a stably integrated construct that retained this region increased 10- to 20-fold .
The ability of the G+C-rich region to increase a-globin expression in stably integrated but not in episomal DNA is similar to findings showing hypersensitive sites 1 , 3 , and 4 of the B locus control region can increase promoter activity of a linked gene only when integrated into chromatin ( 19-23 ) .
Recently , an element within stem-cell antigen CD34 chromatin has also been found to act as an enhancer only in stably integrated DNA ( 24 ) .
It is tempting to suggest that these elements may employ a common mechanism to increase expression from a linked gene .
The results of our in vitro footprint analysis show that multiple consensus and nonconsensus Spl-binding sites present in the -globin G+C-rich flanking region are capable of binding both recombinant Sp1 and Sp1 present in nuclear extracts from MEL cells .
No other transcription factors interacting with this region were detected .
When synthetic Sp1-binding sites were added 5° of the CCAAT box in a minimal -globin promoter construct , expression from the stably integrated construct was identical to that from a construct con Proc .

Acad .

USA 92 ( 1995 ) 7241 taining the entire 190-bp G+C-rich region .
These results , along with the data showing that mutated Sp1 sites no longer increase promoter activity , strongly suggest that multiple Spi-binding sites , rather than the G+C richness of this region , are responsible for the ability of this region to increase expression from a stably integrated « -globin gene .
The observation that expression from a stably integrated minimal « -globin promoter ( CCAAT and TATA sequences only ) construct in individual clones is low and variable suggests that deletion of the G+C-rich region increases the effect position of integration has on a-globin promoter activity .
A plausible hypothesis is that the « -globin G+C-rich region may act by altering chromatin structure around the a-globin pro-moter , allowing it greater access to transcription factors that are differentially expressed during erythroid development .
Since Sp1 is clearly present in nuclear extracts from uninduced MEL cells , it would follow that such an `` open '' chromatin conformation is set up prior to terminal erythroid differentiation .
This hypothesis is supported by Vyas et al .
( 6 ) , who showed that the a-globin gene cluster , as a whole , is in a constitutively open chromatin conformation .
Many studies have shown that Sp1 can activate transcription from various promoters ( 25-29 ) .
However , so far as we know , a chromatin-dependent effect of Spl has not been reported previously .
