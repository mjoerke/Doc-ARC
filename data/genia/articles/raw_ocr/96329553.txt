Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Preferentially Activates the 94-kD STATSA and an 80-kD STAT5S5A Isoform in Human Peripheral Blood Monocytes By Rachel L. Rosen , Karen D. Winestock , Greta Chen , Xiewen Liu , Lothar Hennighausen , and David S. Finbloom Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) induces immediate effects in monocytes by activation of the Janus kinase ( JAK2 ) and STAT transcription factor ( STATS ) pathway .
Recent studies have identified homologues of STATS , STAT5A , and STATSB , as well as lower molecular weight variants of STATS .
To define the activation of the STAT5 homologues and lower molecular weight variant in human monocytes and monocytes differentiated into macrophages by culture in macrophage-CSF ( M-CSF } , we measured the GM-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A , STATSB , and any lower molecular weight STAT5 isoforms .
Freshly isolated monocytes expressed 94-kD STATS5A , 92-kD STAT5B , and an 80-kD STAT5A molecule .
Whereas 94-kD STAT5A was clearly tyrosine phosphorylated and bound to the enhancer element , the gamma response HE RESPONSES OF monocytes to growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) not only develop over days for actions such as activation and differentiation but can also occur rapidly , as is observed for signal transduction events leading to immedi-ate , early gene expression .
GM-CSF treatment of monocytes initiates a rapid cascade of events that results in tyrosine kinase ( JAK2 ) activation and the binding of latent transcription factors to specific DNA elements . ''
We have previously shown that exposure of monocytes to GM-CSF results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a DNA binding factor that recognizes the gamma activation sequence ( GAS ) or gamma response region ( GRR ) element . !
This factor was not related to signal transducers and activators of transduction 1 ( STAT1 ) and was suggested by us to be related to the STAT family .
It has now been shown that GM-CSF , like interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , can activate a STAT protein originally referred to as mammary gland factor , a protein that binds an element similar to the GRR located in the promoter of the casein milk gene . ''
This factor is now referred to as STATS . ''
STATS is also activated by IL-2 , IL-2-like cytokines such as IL-15 , IL-3 , IL-5 , erythropoietin , and thrombopoietin '' ~ and can bind to several GAS elements . ''
Therefore , STATS seems to be involved in a variety of responses observed in cells of hematopoietic lineage following cytokine stimulation .
Unlike the other STAT proteins , STATS consists of two homologues referred to as STATSA and STATSB . '' '' ''

Macrophages lost their ability to express the 80-kD STAT5A protein , but retained their ability to activate STAT5A .
STAT5A-STAT5A homodimers and STAT5A-STAT5B heterodimers formed in response to GM-CSF .
Therefore , activation of STAT5A predominates compared to STAT5B when assayed by direct immunoprecipitation and by evaluation of bound STATs to immobilized GRR .
Selective activation of STATS homologues in addition to generation of lower molecular isoforms may provide specificity and control to genes expressed in response to cytokines such as GM-CSF .

These two proteins are expressed from two different but highly homologous genes and have a molecular weight of about 94 kD ( STATSA ) and 92 kD ( STATS5B ) .
Interestingly , in our earlier studies , the GM-CSF-induced , tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was shown to have a molecular weight of about 80 kD . '
Because at that time STATS was as yet undiscovered , it was not until the purification of an IL-3-induced DNA binding protein that an 80-kD form of STATS5 was appreciated . ''
Indeed , in that study , no full-length protein was isolated by DNA affinity chromatography .
Very recently , a lower molecular weight form of STATSB was found in murine liver in response to injection of complete Freund 's adjuvant , but the functional relevance of this lower molecular weight STATS5B was not determined . ''
Very little is known regarding the activation of the homologues of STATS in response to GM-CSF in monocytes .
Moreover , the role that differentiation plays on the response of macrophages to GM-CSF as measured by STATS activation is unexplored .
To address this question , we studied freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes and compared their profile of STATS activation with monocytes that were cultured in macrophage-CSF ( M-CSF ) , a well-characterized cytokine that results in the activation and differentiation of monocytes into macrophage-like cells . ''
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
- Monocytes were obtained as a leukopak from normal volunteers after leukapheresis .
The mononuclear-enriched population of cells were further purified by Ficoll-Hypaque ( LSM ; Organon Tecknica , Durham , NC ) density centrifugation .
The mononuclear cells , consisting of lymphocytes and monocytes , were then separated by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation in a Beckmann J-6 centrifuge fitted with an elutriation rotor .
Monocytes obtained in this fashion are greater than 95 % pure as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with anti-CD14 .
Monocytes were harvested in suspension and remained so throughout the experimental procedures that used fresh monocytes .
Macrophage-like cells were generated by culturing freshly isolated monocytes in endotoxin-free Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % pooled AB human serum ( Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis , MO ) and M-CSF ( Genetics Institute , Boston , MA ) at 100 ng/mL for 4 to 6 days , at which time they become enlarged and Blood , Vol 88 , No 4 ( August 15 ) , 1996 : pp 1206-1214 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

GM-CSF ACTIVATION OF STAT5A AND STAT5B somewhat adherent .
The recovery of monocyte/macrophages was between 60 % and 80 % and the cells were greater than 99 % viable .
Immunoprecipitations .
| Fresh .
monocytes or monocyte/macrophages were treated with GM-CSF ( 50 ng/mL ; Schering Plough , Kenilworth , NJ ) for various times at 37°C .
The cells were then solubilized in a buffer consisting of 1 % TX100 ( Piece , Rockford , IL ) , 0.15 mol/L NaCl , 50 mmol/L NaF , 5 mmol/L sodium pyrophos-phate , 1 mmol/L vanadate , and 5 pg/mL each of leupeptin , pepstatin , and aprotinin .
For some immunoprecipitations , additional NaC ) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mol/L .
The extract was centrifuged at 18,000g for I0 minutes and the postnuclear extract was incubated with the desired antibodies .
Anti-STATS5 was produced in rabbits using a peptide consisting of the COOH terminal 50 amino acids of which the first 30 amino acids of the peptide were about 75 % homologous for both STATSA and STATS5B .
* '' '' Anti-STATS5A and anti-STATSB were produced in rabbits using the 20 COOH terminal amino acids unique to STAT5A and the 11 COOH terminal amino acids unique to STATS5B , respectively . '' ''
There was no cross-reactivity of the anti-STATSA and anti-STATSB antibodies .
The anti-STATS antibody recognized both STATS5SA and STAT5B .
The immunoprecipitates were isolated with Sepharose-protein G ( Phar-macia , Piscataway , NJ ) , released in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer , and electrophoresed on 7.5 % minigels ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) or 8 % standard 15-cm gels .
The proteins were transferred to polyvinyldipyrolidine fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Milli-pore , Bedford , MA ) , probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies ( PY20 ; Leinco , St Louis , MO ) , and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
For some experiments , the membranes were reprobed with the immunoprecipitating antibody or another antibody and developed after incubation with an alkaline phosphatase anti-Ig with nitroblue tetrazo-lium ( NBT ) chemistry .
DNA affinity purification .
- The upper strand of the GRR element of the promoter of the FeyRI receptor was synthesized with a biotinylated BamHI overhang .
The lower stand was synthesized with the BamHI overhang but without the biotinylated base .
Each oligonucle-otide was purified by urea/denaturing gel electrophoresis and then annealed in 0.1 mol/L NaCl .
The annealed biotinylated GRR probe was then incubated with Sepharose-avidin ( Sigma ) at a ratio to yield maximal saturation of the Sepharose with the DNA .
For the GRR-sepharose precipitations , cells were treated with GM-CSF for various times at 37°C and solubilized in whole cell extraction buffer ( 10 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.3 , 400 mmol/L KCI , 10 % glycerol , 2 mmol/ L EDTA , 1 mmol/L EGTA , 0.1 % TX100 , 1 mmol/L DTT , 1 mmol/ L vanadate , and protein inhibitors as previously described ) .
The GRR-sepharose was incubated for 1 to 2 hours at 4°C in the extract after the salt was diluted to 133 mmol/L .
The extracts were washed in whole cell lysis buffer with 60 mmol/L KCI , and the bound proteins were released in SDS sample buffer .
The proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) , followed by immunoblotting with the anti-STAT or antiphosphotyrosine antibodies .
RESULTS Activation of STATS in freshly isolated monocytes .
- Monocytes , isolated in suspension by elutriation , were incubated with GM-CSF , and the activation of STATS was determined .
Immunoprecipitated STATS was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to GM-CSF ( Fig 1A , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Tyrosine-phosphorylated , immunoprecipitated STATS was also observed using antibodies against STATSA ( Fig 1A , lanes 1 and 2 ) and STATSB ( Fig 1A , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Only the full-length STATS molecules ( 94/92 kD ) were observed to be tyrosine phosphorylated in fresh monocytes despite the finding that the 80-kD protein was present in the immunoprecipi- 1207 tates as determined by reprobing of the membrane with the immunoprecipitating antibodies ( Fig 1B , lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) .
Only in the anti-STAT5A immunoprecipitate was the 80kD protein observed , suggesting that , in monocytes , STAT5SA ( Fig 1B , lanes 1 and 2 ) , in contrast to STATSB ( Fig 1B , lanes 3 and 4 ) , existed as a lower molecular weight form .
In nonmyeloid cells , such as T-cell blasts , no 80-kD band was observed ( Fig 1B , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Therefore , in T-cell blasts , the ability to activate STATS ( Fig 1A , lanes 7 and 8 ; and thereby STATS-dependent genes ) in response to IL-2 appeared to require only full-length STATS proteins .
When extracts from fresh monocytes that had been exposed to GM-CSF were incubated with Sepharose-GRR , additional information regarding the formation of the STATS DNA binding complex was shown .
In contrast to the immunoprecipitations in which essentially no tyrosine-phosphorylated 80-kD STATS was observed , there was a moderate amount of the 80-kD STATS that was clearly bound to the GRR element ( Fig 2A , lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) .
This was observed when both the anti-STAT5 ( Fig 2A , lanes 5 and 6 ) and anti-STATSA ( Fig 2A , lanes 1 and 2 ) were used to probe the membrane containing the GRR-Sepharose isolated proteins .
In contrast , no 80-kD band was observed bound to the GRR element when the membrane was probed with the anti-STATS5B ( Fig 2A , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
This finding confirmed that the 80-kD protein observed in fresh monocytes was predominantly STATS5A or antigenically related to STATSA .
In addition to the 80-kD protein bound to the GRR-Sepha-rose , the 94/92-kD STATS proteins were also observed .
The intensity of the bands on the immunoblot suggested that much more STATSA than STATSB was bound to the GRR element ( Fig 2A , lane 2 v lane 4 ) .
When the membranes in Fig 2A were reprobed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies , both the 94/92-kD ( Fig 2B , lanes 2 and 4 ) and the 80-kD proteins were shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated ( Figure 2B , lanes 2 ) .
There was no STAT1 present on immunoblots containing GM-CSF-activated , GRR-bound proteins ( D. Finbloom , unpublished observations ) .
Moreover , GM-CSF-activated GRR binding activity as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays could not be `` supershifted ' '' '' with anti-STAT1 antibody . '
Activation of STATS in monocyte/macrophages .
- When monocytes were cultured in M-CSF for several days , the cells enlarged and acquired characteristics of tissue macro-phages . ''
When these cells were exposed to GM-CSF , STATS was activated as determined by its induced tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig 3 , lanes 1 through 6 ) .
When the extracts of cells exposed to GM-CSF were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT5SA and anti-STAT5B , there was an intense band at 94/92 kD of essentially equal intensity for the two homologues ( Fig 3 , lanes 1 through 4 ) .
A band of similar mobility but of lesser intensity was observed when the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-STATS ( Fig 3 , lane 6 ) .
Again , as with fresh monocytes , no 80-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was immunoprecipitated by the antibodies .
However , in contrast to fresh monocytes , when the membrane from the anti-STATS5 immunoprecipitations from the macrophages was reprobed with anti-STATS5 , only the 92/ 94-kD doublet was noted ( Fig 3 , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
No 80-kD protein was observed in these cells .

We next exposed monocytes cultured in M-CSF to GMCSF and then solubilized the cells in whole cell lysis buffer for isolation of DNA binding proteins on the Sepharose-GRR .
In response to GM-CSF , both STATSA and STATSB were observed to bind to the GRR element ( Fig 4 , lanes 1 through 4 ) .
As was observed with fresh monocytes , more STATSA bound to the GRR when compared with STATSB ( Fig 4 , lane 2 v 4 ) .
When similar membranes containing STATSA and STATSB from GRR precipitations from other experiments were probed for antiphosphotyrosine , there was substantially less tyrosine-phosphorylated STATSB compared with STATSA ( data not shown ) .
On close observation of the membrane probed with anti-STATS ( Fig 4 , lane 6 ) , there was a doublet at the 94/92-kD region .
The lower band , presumably STATSB , was much weaker in intensity than the upper ( STATSA ) band .
When this membrane was reprobed for antiphosphotyrosine , only the upper or 94-kD band was observed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated ( Fig 3 , lane 8 ) .
These data suggested that there may be preferential tyrosine phosphorylation of STATSA in response to GMCSF in this monocyte/macrophage population .
Kinetics of activation of STAT53 .
We next explored the rate of activation of STATSA and STATSB in fresh monocytes .
Preliminary experiments using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the GRR probe showed that activation of GRR binding occurred within 5 minutes and persisted for up to 45 minutes , after which the intensity of the shifted band decreased ( G. Chen and D. Finbloom , unpublished ob a= as as as < -f *- BOkD ROSEN ET AL Fig 1 .
STATS activation by GM-CSF in freshly isolated monocytes .
( A ) Fresh monocytes ( lanes 1 through 6 ) were exposed to GM-CSF at 50 ng/mL for 30 minutes at 37°C and then solubilized for immunoprecipitation of STATS proteins .
The immunoprecipitates ( anti-STAT5A , lanes 1 and 2 ; anti-STAT5B , lanes 3 and 4 ; and anti-STAT5 , lanes 5 and 6 ) were isolated on 7.5 % SDS-PAGE minigels and transferred to PVDF , and the membrane was probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody and developed using ECL .
For comparison , T-cell blasts were treated with IL-2 and solubilized , and STATS was immunoprecipitated with anti-STATS5 ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .

servations ) .
In addition , we noted that GRR binding activity was recovered to a greater extent from nuclear extracts as compared with cytoplasmic extracts , suggesting that there was rapid translocation of the activated STATS complex to the nucleus .
We explored the kinetics of activation by both immunoprecipitation with anti-STATSA and anti-STATS5B antibodies and by precipitation of the DNA binding complex with GRR agarose .
Activation of both STATSA and STATSB occurred within 5 minutes after treatment with GM-CSF ( Fig 5A , lanes 1 through 5 ) .
Maximal tyrosine phosphorylation for immunoprecipitated STATSA and STATSB was at 5 to 15 minutes .
At 60 minutes there was still readily observable tyrosine phosphorylation of both STATS isoforms .
The kinetics of activation were somewhat different for STATS subjected to GRR precipitation ( Fig 5B , lanes 1 through 5 ) .
Maximal binding to the GRR agarose occurred at 15 to 30 minutes , and even at 90 minutes considerable GRR binding activity remained .
The kinetics were similar for both STATSA and STATSB .
These data confirm the preliminary gel shift data by suggesting that translocation of the activated STATS molecules begins to occur shortly after activation .
STATS homodimer and heterodimer formation .
It has been well-documented for many cytokines that activate STAT proteins that both homodimer and heterodimer formation occurs between various STAT proteins in response to cytokine stimulation .
'* To assess the possibility that the tyrosine-phosphorylated band observed in the STAT 5B immunoprecipitations was at least in part , if not predominantly , because of the presence of STAT5SA within a heterodimer , we From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Extracts were made and the STATS proteins immuno- B precipitated with anti-STAT5A ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) or anti-STATSB ( lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) .
The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to PVDF membranes , and probed with either anti-STATSB ( lanes 1 , 2 , 7 , and 8 ) or anti-STAT5A ( lanes 3 through 6 ) .
The membranes were developed using ECL .
( B ) Monocytes were treated as in ( A ) and the anti-STAT5A ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and anti-STAT5B ( lanes 3 and 4 ) immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted and probed with antiphosphotyrosine .
The monocyte/macrophage cells were also examined for the formation of homodimers and heterodimers of STATS .
Extracts of control and GM-CSF-treated cells exposed to anti-STATS5B - immunoprecipitated STATSA from GM-CSF-treated cells only ( Fig 7A , lane 2 v 1 ) .
In contrast , extracts immunoprecipitated with anti-STATSA contained only STATSA ; no STATSB was noted ( Fig 7A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
That the STATS proteins were immunoprecipitated could be appreciated when the membrane was probed with anti-STATS ( Fig 7 , lanes 3 and 6 ) .
As in the fresh monocytes , the tyrosine-phosphorylated band observed in the anti-STATSB immunoprecipitate ( Fig 7B , lane 4 v 2 ) was probably a combination of tyrosine-phosphorylated STATSB and STATSA .
To ascertain whether the STATSA immunoprecipitated with STATSB contributed to much of the observed tyrosine phosphorylated protein , we optimized standard size SDS-PAGE to separate the STATSA and STATSB proteins .
In fresh untreated monocytes , there was a clear separation between STATSA and STATSB ( Fig 8 , upper panel , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
In response to GM-CSF , there was marked tyrosine phosphorylation of STATSA ( Fig 8 , upper panel , lane 6 ) .
In the anti-STATSB immunoprecipitate , a triplet band was observed ( Fig 8 , upper panel , lane 4 ) .
In a similar experi-ment , when the membrane was probed with anti-STATSB specifically , this triplet band was also observed with the uppermost band corresponding to the predominant tyrosine-phosphorylated STATS band ( D. Finbloom , unpublished observations ) .
The middle band of the triplet probably represents partially phosphorylated STATSB on tyrosine and serine and/or threonine .
The tyrosine-phosphorylated band in the anti-STATSB migrated as a doublet ( Fig 8 , upper and lower panels , lane 8 ) and most likely contained both Blot : 1211 Anti- 5 J > on J on J > on J g | g | J ( z | |g | JO Control Control | amcsFr B- & a PWL Control Control ro Bim amcsr < -94/92kD * 80kD mlgl—GMCSF _ [ de ] ~I CoO Anti-phosphotyrosine 94/92kD - __ « a_ « = * Soll 1 2 3 4 STATSA and STATSB .
A similar scenario occurred with M-CSF-driven macrophages ( Fig 8 , lower panel ) .
DISCUSSION Activation of STAT proteins is now regarded as a unifying event for cytokine and growth factor-induced signal transduction .
Activation of STATS occurs in response to several seemingly unrelated cytokines , including GM-CSF , IL-2 , thrombopoietin , erythropoietin , IL-3 , IL-5 , interferon- « ( IFN-a ) , prolactin , and growth hormone .
Unlike the other known STAT proteins , STATS consists of two highly homologous proteins , STATSA and STATSB , whose differential activation by GM-CSF is the subject of this report .
In monocytes , we show that GM-CSF appears to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of both STATSA and STATSB when each protein is immunoprecipitated with its specific antibody .
However , the finding that the mobility of the tyrosine-phosphorylated band on SDS-PAGE is essentially identical for both the anti-STAT5SA and anti-STATS5B immunoprecipitate suggests the possibility that one STATS may be preferentially activated over the other and immunoprecipitated as a heterodimeric complex .
Homodimers and heterodimers of STAT proteins have been described for STAT !
and STAT3 in response to IL-10 .
'® In our studies , when the anti-STATS5B immunoprecipitates are probed with anti-STATSA , STATSA is present , indicating that STATSA-STATSB heterodimer formation occurs in response to GM-CSF .
The finding that in the anti-STATS5A immunoprecipitations only STATSA is observed suggests that , in addition , STATSA-STATSA homodimers assemble in response to GM-CSF .
Because there is more STATSA than STATSB that binds to the immobilized GRR from GM-CSF-treated extracts , activation of From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Extracts were made and the STATS proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT5B ( lanes 1 through 3 ) or anti-STAT5A ( lanes 4 through 6 ) .
The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to PVDF membranes , and probed with either anti-STAT5A ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , anti-STAT5B ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , or anti-STAT5 ( lanes 3 and 6 ) .
The membranes were developed using ECL .
( B ) Cells were treated as in ( A ) and the anti-STAT5A ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and anti-STAT5B ( lanes 3 and 4 ) immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted and probed with antiphosphotyrosine .
STATSA occurs to a greater extent in monocytes exposed to GM-CSF .
Standard size SDS-PAGE shows that the tyrosine-phosphorylated STATSB migrates to the same extent as STATSA , suggesting that the band observed by phosphotyrosine immunobloting contains both STATS isoforms .
These data are consistent with STATS dimer formation that is at least STATSA homodimers and STATSA-STATSB hetero-dimers .
However , the data do not exclude the possibility of STATSB homodimers also .
Lower molecular weight forms of STAT proteins have occasionally been described since the initial observation of STAT1/3 as an alternately spiced variant of STAT1a . ''
Although we have previously identified an 80-kD tyrosine phosphoprotein that binds the GRR element in response to GM-CSF , '' it is only recently that other investigators have noted the presence of a lower molecular weight STATS of 77 and 79 kD isolated from IL-3-treated myeloid cell line using a GRR-like element . ''
Interestingly , no full-length 94/ 92-kD STATSA protein was isolated in this manner .
This ROSEN ET AL suggests , along with our findings , that the tyrosine-phosphorylated 80-kD protein is only observable on GRR-Sepharose and that these lower molecular weight forms may play important roles in gene regulation .
When cells treated with GM-CSF have been solubilized with the same buffer used for the GRR-agarose precipitations , anti-STAT5A antibodies will detect the tyrosine-phosphorylated 80-kD STATSA ( D. Finbloom , unpublished observations ) .
This suggests that either the tyrosine-phosphorylated 80-kD STATSA rapidly translocates to the nucleus and is therefore poorly extracted from the nucleus by the immunoprecipitation buffer or that the 80-kD STATSA is generated from 94-kD STATSA in the nucleus .
The data do not allow for a distinction to be make at this time .
Not all cells ( eg , T-cell blasts ) express the lower molecular weight forms of STATS and the mechanism generating this protein may be variable .
In another study examining activation of STATS homologues by IL-3 in murine OTT-1 cells , a hematopoietic cell line , both STATSA and 5B are equally activated , but no lower molecular weight form is identified . ''
Similarly , in studies addressing the activation of STATS by IL-2 , only full-length STATS is observed .
In none of the IL-2 studies is there made a distinction between the STAT homologues ; there is also not any mention of a lower molecular weight species . '' ''
However , in the one study that actually purifies the IL-2-induced STATS on a GRR-like element , on probing tissues for STATS mRNA , there are two predominant mRNAs at 6 and 4 kb that correspond to STATSB and STATSA , respectively . ''
Moreover , in some tissues , notably placenta , testis , and mus-cle , there is a smaller ( 3 kb ) mRNA that was not further characterized . ''
In freshly isolated monocytes , we observe that the 80kD protein is antigenically related to STATSA but not to STATSB .
Its potential role in transcription is suggested by the finding that the 80-kD STATSA along with the 94-kD STATSA binds to the GRR element , is tyrosine-phosphory-lated , and seems to be exclusively located in the nucleus .
The finding that only one of the STATS homologues has a shortened form and that this may be tissue specific is not inconsistent because lower molecular weight STATS isolated from liver was only observed for STATSB .
'° Because the anti-STATSA was prepared with a peptide consisting of the COOH terminal amino acids of STATSA , a simple truncation can not explain the presence of this shortened form .
Perhaps an alternative splicing event occurs , as is observed with STAT13 .
Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages is known to have effects on STAT1 activation by cytokines such as IFN-y . ''
In addition , different GAS binding factors are observed when comparing immature and mature myeloid cells . ''
When macrophages are generated by culture in M-CSF , the expression of the 80-kD STATSA is greatly reduced or lost altogether .
With the GRR-Sepharose precipitations , a very weak 80-kD band can occasionally be noted , but in other experiments no evidence of the 80-kD STATSA is seen ( D. Finbloom , unpublished observations ) .
These findings , along with those from the studies of others , suggest that the degree of differentiation of cells can affect the STAT proteins expressed and activated .

- GM-CSF preferentially activates STAT5A .
Monocytes were prepared as described in the Materials and Methods .
( Upper panel ) Freshly isolated monocytes .
Cells were treated with GM-CSF as described in the Fig 1 legend and processed for immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT5A ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) or anti-STATSB ( lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) and immunoblot analysis .
The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on standard 15-cm 8 % gels .
Lanes 1 through 4 represent the membrane probed with anti-STATS5 and lanes 5 through 8 represent the membrane probed with antiphosphotyrosine .
( Lower panel ) M-CSF-driven monocyte/macrophages .
Cells were treated with GM-CSF as described in the Fig 3 legend and processed for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis as in ( A ) .
Lanes 1 through 4 represent the membrane probed with anti-STATS and lanes 5 through 8 represent the membrane probed with antiphosphotyrosine .
sine phosphorylation , transcriptional activation may require the phosphorylation of a serine within a MAP kinase ( MAPK ) site ( XPXSP ) close to the COOH terminus of some STAT proteins . ''
Although some of the STATs appear to have a MAPK consensus sequence at the COOH terminal region that is important for transactivation , '' this is not the case for STATSA or STATSB . ''
This site in the human STATSA is DSRLSP . ''
This sequence retains the serine on the COOH half , but does not have the important proline on the NH2 half of the region .
STATSB lacks all aspects of a MAPK consensus site . ''
However , it is of interest that ligand-induced transcription of a STATSA driven luciferase construct is about sixfold to sevenfold greater than the comparable STATSB-driven construct . ''
This may , in part , be one reason for the preferential activation of STATSA over STATS5B and may point to the COOH terminal region of STATSA as important for ligand-induced transactivation by an as yet undefined mechanism .
The cellular genes that are dependent on GM-CSF-acti-vated STAT proteins are ill-defined .
Genes encoding major histocompatibility complex class II expression are enhanced in response to GM-CSF , but the role for STAT proteins in their enhancement remains to be determined .
Other genes such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) are induced by GM-CSF , '' ° but the role of STAT protein involvement can only be inferred from studies using IFN-y activation of ICAM-1 .
Reciprocal relationships between inducers of genes and the gene products are beginning to be appreci-ated .
For instance , binding of CD4 positive T cells to ICAM-1 will induce the secretion of GM-CSF , '' which then goes on to enhance ICAM-1 expression in cells .
Similarly , IFN-y will enhance GM-CSF receptor expression , '' which may , in turn , lead to increased signaling by GM-CSF and modulation of IFN-y responsiveness . ''
Therefore , a thorough under standing of the activation of STATS homologues and their variants by GM-CSF will allow for a better understanding of its various effects in a prime cellular target such as monocytes and macrophages .
