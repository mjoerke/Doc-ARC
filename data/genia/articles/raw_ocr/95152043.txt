Posttranscriptional Regulation of Macrophage Tissue Factor Expression by Antioxidants By G.F. Brisseau , A.P.B .
Dackiw , P.Y.C .
Cheung , N. Christie , and O.D .
Rotstein Tissue factor ( TF ) expression by cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage represents an important mechanism underlying the initiation of fibrin deposition at sites of extravascular inflammation .
Recent evidence suggests a role for oxidant stress in the signalling pathway of various cell types by virtue of its ability to induce DNA binding of various transcription factors , including nuclear factor « B and AP-1 .
The effect of antioxidant treatment on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -in-duced TF expression was examined in murine peritoneal macrophages and human monocytes .
Both pyrrolidine di-thiocarbamate , an oxidant scavenger , and N-acetyl-cysteine , a precursor of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione , inhibited stimulation of macrophage procoagulant activity by LPS .
Northern blot analysis showed that neither of these agents reduced LPS-stimulated TF mRNA accumulation , thereby suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism for the effect .
Immunofluorescence studies of human monocytes using polyclonal anti-TF antibody showed that N-acetyl-cys- EACTIVE OXYGEN species ( ROS ) have traditionally been considered to be toxic molecules effecting tissue injury in their local environment . '
Their central role in the pathophysiology of several disease processes has been well demonstrated .
These processes include ischemia/reperfusion syndromes , organ dysfunction associated with systemic inflammatory states , tissue injury initiated by exogenous chem-icals , and even the aging process . '' ''
The common mechanism underlying these effects is the destruction of membranes , proteins , and nucleic acids by toxic oxygen metabolites generated by cells in response to various stimuli or signals .
However , several lines of evidence suggest that ROS may contribute to cell activation .
First , ROS have been shown to be mitogenic and act as tumor promoters in some cell lines . '' ''
Secondly , treatment of cells with oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide ( H ; ,0 ; ) and xanthine/xanthine oxidase induce the expression of several of the early response genes , including c-fos , c-myc , c-jun , egr-1 , and JE . ''
Thirdly , stimuli known to induce oxidant stress such as UV irradiation are also able to induce early gene expression .
Finally , ROS initiate DNA binding and transactivation by various transcription factors .
Devary et al° showed that H , O ; and UV irradiation initiated AP-1 binding in HeLa cells , whereas others ' '' have shown that H , O , was able to induce the translocation of the transcription factor , nuclear factor KB ( NF- « B ) from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and cause activation of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat ( HIV-1 LTR ) , a gene dependent on intact NF- « B binding sites in the promoter region .
The effect was blocked by various thiol compounds as well as by other antioxidants such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate . ''
Furthermore , these antioxidants also blocked NF- « B translocation induced by a wide range of stimuli , including lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , lectins , and the cytokines , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) . ' ''
When considered together , these data suggest that oxidants may play a central role in the activation of various genes , particularly those endowed with NF- « B and/or AP-1 binding sites in their promoter/enhancer regions .
Blood , Vol 85 , No 4 ( February 15 ) , 1995 : pp 1025-1035 teine treatment prevented the characteristic plasmalemmal localization of TF antigen that occurs in response to LPS .
Western blot analysis showed that N-acetyl-cysteine reduced the accumulation of the 47-kD mature glycoprotein in LPS-treated cells , a finding consistent with the results of the immunofluorescence studies .
Furthermore , these conditions did not result in an accumulation of the less mature forms of TF .
When considered together , these data suggest that antioxidants exert their effects by impairing translation and/or by causing degradation of newly translated protein .
The effect of antioxidants on tumor necrosis factor appeared to be species specific , with no effect on LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor in murine cells , but with inhibition in human monocytes .
The posttranscriptional effect of antioxidants on TF expression data suggests a novel mechanism whereby these agents might modulate monocyte/macrophage activation .

Local fibrin deposition mediated via the expression of cell-associated procoagulants appears to be important in the patho-genesis of several disease processes , including viral hepati-tis , > '' lupus glomerulonephritis , '* '' '' acute lung injury , '' '' and bacterial abscesses .
'* '' '' Although cellular procoagulants represent a heterogeneous group of molecules , tissue factor ( TF ) appears to be the predominant procoagulant molecule synthesized in response to most proinflammatory stimuli .
This 47-kD surface-expressed glycoprotein initiates the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade by binding factor VII and augmenting its conversion to factor Va. '' The resulting factor VII/VIIa complex activates both factor X and factor IX , leading to ultimate clot formation .
The complete sequences for both the human and murine TF genes have been re-ported '' and both have a 56-bp LPS response element within their promoters .
This region is characterized by the presence of two AP-1 and one NF- « B binding sites .
Binding to both the distal AP-1 and the NF- « B sites is required for optimal transcription of the TF gene . ''
Based on the demonstrated ability of oxidants to induce binding of these transcription factors to their respective DNA binding sites and initiate gene From the Department of Surgery , University of Toronto , and the Toronto Hospital Research Institute Toronto , Ontario , Canada .

These studies showed that both N-acetyl-cysteine ( NAC ) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) inhibited the increase in macrophage/monocyte TF activity induced by LPS .
However , this effect was not mediated by a reduction in TF gene expression but rather by an alteration in the posttranscriptional modification of the protein that prevented its functional expression at the cell surface .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals .
Six- to eight-week-old female Swiss Webster mice were obtained from Taconic Farms .
After delivery to our animal facility , animals were allowed to acclimatize for 2 to 4 days before use in these studies .

Solutions .
- Supplemented RPMI contained RPMI 1640 with 10 % heat-inactivated FBS , L-glutamine ( 2 mmoVL ) , and 25 mmoVL HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) .
Zymosan and LPS were suspended in sterile water .
Cell preparation .
Murine peritoneal macrophages were harvested by peritoneal lavage , using 10 mL of sterile HBSS , 4 days after the intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL of thioglycolate medium .
Lavage fluids were pooled and centrifuged at 200g for 10 minutes .

The effect of antioxidants on LPS-induced luminol-dependent chemiluminescence .
Murine macrophages ( 10°/mL ) were incubated in the presence or absence of either PDTC { 1 mmol/L ) or NAC ( 30 mmol/L ) for 45 minutes and then stimulated with LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) .
Changes in chemiluminescence were recorded over a 4-hour period in an automated luminometer .
A representative trace is shown .
Relative total oxidant production obtained by integration of the area under the curve is shown at the right { mean + SEM , n = 3 ) .
centrifuged again at 200g for 10 minutes .
The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of sterile water for 15 seconds to lyse any red blood cells and then diluted to 45 mL with sterile HBSS .
The suspension was sedimented again and the cells were resuspended in RPMI and then counted using a hemocy-tometer .
The cell population was then diluted to 1 to 2 X 10° cells/ mL in supplemented RPMI and aliquoted into polypropylene tissue culture tubes .
This technique generated a cell suspension with a viability in excess of 95 % , as assessed by trypan blue exclusion , and a cell population of 80 % to 90 % macrophages , as assessed by nonspecific esterase staining , Wright 's staining , and transmission electron microscopy .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear ( PBM ) cells were isolated from normal healthy donors by drawing 20 mL of blood into tubes containing heparin .
Cells were then layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque and centrifuged at 400g for 20 minutes .
The layer containing PBM cells was then aspirated , washed twice , and resuspended in supplemented RPML .
This cell population contained 25 % to 35 % monocytes as assessed by Wright 's stain .
Cells were stimulated for 0.5 to 6 hours at 37°C in 5 % CO ; with either LPS or zymosan .
The antioxidant to be tested was added at t = 0 hour and was present throughout the incubation period , except in the delayed addition experiments .
At the end of the incubation period , cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 200g for 10 minutes .
Supernatants were aspirated and frozen at -70°C for later measurement of TNF .
Cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 and frozen at ~70°C for measurement of procoagulant activity ( PCA ) .
For Western blot analysis , cells were rapidly sedimented and pellets were immediately solubilized in boiling Laemmli sample buffer .
Measurement of macrophage PCA .
- PCA in freeze-thawed macrophages was determined by measuring their capacity to shorten the spontaneous clotting time of normal citrated human plasma in a one-stage clotting assay . ''
An 80 LL sample of macrophage cell lysates obtained by freeze-thawing was added to 80 gL of citrated normal human platelet-poor plasma , and then 80 LL of 25 mmol/L CaCl ; was added to initiate the reaction .
The time taken for the appearance of a fibrin gel at 37°C with gentle agitation was recorded .
Previous studies by Lando and Edgington '' '' indicated that LPS-induced murine macrophage PCA is only slightly less effective at shortening the clotting time of human plasma than at shortening the clotting time of mouse plasma .
Clotting times were converted to milliunits of PCA by comparison with clotting times of a rabbit brain thromboplastin standard in which 36 mg ( dry weight ) per milliliter was assigned a value of 100,000 mU of PCA .

TF detection by immunofluorescence .
- PBM cells were incubated on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 20 minutes at 37°C in 5 % CO ; and nonadherent cells were washed off .
Adherent cells were then fixed and permeabilized in cold acetone .
Cells were then incubated with the polyclonal antihuman TF antibody in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 30 minutes , washed , and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -labeled secondary antibody for a further 30 minutes .
Cells were viewed with a Nikon Diphot-TMD epifluorescence microscope ( Nikon Canada , Inc , Toronto , Canada ) .
TF detection by Western blotting .
TF expression in human PBM was determined by immunoblotting with polyclonal antihuman TF antibodies . ''
After electrophoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide gels , the samples were blotted onto Immobilon using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot system ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) for 1 hour at 100 V. The blot was incubated with 10 mL of blocking solution and then exposed to a 1/1,000 dilution of the primary antibody for 2 hours while shaking at room temperature .
The blot was then washed three times with antibody buffer solution and incubated with a 1/5,000 dilution of anti-IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase .
The blots were washed , dried , and quantitated using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( ECL ; Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .28 Measurement of TNF .
TNF in supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
The antibody sandwich was detected by fluorescence . ''
Microtiter plates were coated with a monoclonal antimurine TNF antibody , incubated with sam-ples , washed , and then exposed to the polyclonal rabbit antimurine TNF antibody .
The enzyme sandwich was then incubated with goat antirabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase for 1 hour at room temperature before the addition of the substrate solution , 5-fluorosalicyl phos-phate , and the developing reagent , Terbium-EDTA .
The fluorescence was measured with a time-resolved fluorometer and the calibration curve and the data reduction were performed by automatic immuno-analyzer ( Cyber Fluor 615 ; Scintrex , Concord , Canada ) .
Measurement of ROS .
- ROS were determined by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence according to Allen . ''
Briefly , 10° macrophages in a luminol-balanced salt solution were added to polystyrene tubes and placed in an automated luminometer ( Axis ; ExOxEmis , San Antonio , TX ) at 37°C for 45 minutes .

TF and TNF mRNA .
In murine macrophages , TF and TNF mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis using the cDNA probe for murine TF !
( kindly provided by Dr Michael Getz , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) or the cDNA probe for murine TNF ( kindly provided by Dr Bruce Beutler , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Dallas , TX ) .
Briefly , 10 x 10° cells were pelleted and total RNA was extracted using the method of Chomezynski and Sacchi . ''
After electrophoresis , RNA was transferred to Immobilon and hybridized with the °P random-labeled cDNA probe for murine TF or murine TNF .
Comparable RNA loading between lanes was assured by probing with a cDNA probe for rat -tubulin ( provided by Dr Dan Drucker , University of Toronto , Toronto , Ontario , Canada ) . ''
For detection of human TF mRNA or TNF mRNA , total RNA was extracted from human PBM cells and , after electrophoresis and transfer to Immobilon , was hybridized with the °P random-labeled cDNA probe for human TF ( American Type Culture Collection [ ATCC ] , Bethesda , MD ) or the °P random-labeled cDNA probe for human TNF ( ATCC ) .
Densitometry was used to compare the relative intensities of the hybridization signals in studies investigating the levels of murine TF transcripts .
Endotoxin contamination .
_ RPMI-1640 , HBSS , sterile water , and sterile saline were tested for endotoxin contamination using the standard Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay ( Association of Cape Cod , Woods Hole , MA ) and were found to contain less than 0.1 ng of endotoxin per milliliter , which constituted the lower limit of the test .
Statistics .
- Statistics were calculated using one-way analysis of variance and Neumann-Keuls for comparison between groups .
Data are expressed as the mean and standard error of n observations .
RESULTS Antioxidant effects of PDTC and NAC .
- Two antioxidants with different mechanisms of action were studied .
PDTC BRISSEAU ET AL is an oxygen radical scavenger , '' whereas NAC augments endogenous cellular antioxidant activity by increasing levels of reduced glutathione . '' '' '' ''
The ability of PDTC and NAC to abrogate luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was used to examine their antioxidant activity .
Both agents markedly reduced the chemiluminescent response to LPS stimulation ( Fig 1 ) .
The inset of Fig 1 shows the mean of the area under the curve of three separate experiments .
Effect of antioxidants on PCA .
- Having defined their antioxidant properties , these molecules were tested for their effect on LPS-induced PCA .
PDTC caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PCA in cells stimulated with LPS ( Fig 2A ) , without affecting cell viability ( > 95 % viability by trypan blue exclusion ) .
The IC , , for PDTC was approximately 77 mol/L and reached almost complete inhibition at 5 mmol/ L PDTC alone had no effect on basal levels of PCA .
Neither pyrrolidine nor pyroglutamic acid , a cyclic molecule resembling PDTC but without radical scavenging properties , was able to mimick the effect .
PDTC added to the functional PCA assay also had no effect on the clotting time reductions induced by rabbit brain thromboplastin or cell-associated TF induced by 4 hours of preincubation with LPS ( data not shown ) .
A time course of PCA induction showed that PDTC exhibited inhibitory effects starting at 2 hours , a time point at which functional PCA activity first became evident ( Fig 2B ) .
Figure 2C illustrates the effect of delayed addition of PDTC on PCA expression by cells exposed to LPS for 4 hours .
The addition of PDTC more than 2 hours after treatment with LPS resulted in a reversal of the inhibitory effect of PDTC .
The inhibitory effect was not unique for LPS-induced PCA , because PDTC also inhibited the stimulation of PCA by the fungal cell wall component , zymosan ( data not shown ) .
Disulfiram , which has antioxidant properties similar to those of PDTC , effected a comparable reduction in LPS-induced PCA ( data not shown ) .
As noted in the previous section , NAC exerts its antioxidant effect by increasing levels of the endogenous antioxi-dant , reduced glutathione .
Figure 3 illustrates the effect of NAC on PCA induction by LPS .
NAC inhibited PCA at 30 mmol/L , a concentration shown to cause a fivefold increase in intracellular glutathione levels over 4 hours of incubation ( data not shown ) .
Despite the reduced absolute level of PCA in NAC-treated LPS cells , the fold increase after stimulation with LPS was comparable in the presence or absence of NAC ( 10.6-fold v 9.3-fold , respectively ) .
Viability by trypan blue exclusion was greater than 94 % .
Effect of antioxidants on TF mRNA levels .
Previous studies have shown that LPS-induced PCA in macrophages was caused by the expression of TF on the cell surface .
`` * This increase required new RNA and protein synthesis . ''
Because antioxidants have been reported to prevent agonist-induced gene transcription by virtue of their ability to inhibit translocation of the transcriptional activator NF-kB into the nucleus , '' it was hypothesized that PDTC and NAC might inhibit TF expression at the transcriptional level .
Northern analysis was performed to assess TF mRNA levels in LPS-treated cells in the presence or absence of the antioxidants .
Similar to findings reported for human monocytes , '' LPS induced an increase in TF mRNA in murine macrophages From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Figure 4B and D illustrates the mean intensities of the hybridization signals normalized for loading for studies performed with PDTC ( n = 4 ) and NAC ( n = 3 ) , respectively .
Effect of antioxidants on TF expression .
- Immunofluo-resence and Western blot analysis with polyclonal antihuman TF antibody were used to evaluate posttranscriptional alterations in TF .
These studies were performed in human monocytes because of the availability of the antihuman TF antibody and the fact that others have documented poor cross-reactivity with rodent TF .
* ' Figure SA shows the effect of NAC ( 30 mmol/L ) on PCA in human monocytes after exposure to LPS .
As shown for murine cells , NAC markedly reduced LPS-induced PCA in these cells .
Similarly , PDTC ( 1 mmol/L ) inhibited LPS-stimulated PCA in human monocytes ( Fig 5B ) .
Human monocytes exposed to either NAC or PDTC for 4 hours retained their ability to exclude trypan blue ( > 95 % ) , suggesting that the effect was not caused by cytotoxicity .
The fold increase in PCA after stimulation with LPS was also higher in the presence of NAC ( 62-fold ) than in the absence of NAC ( 36-fold ) , further showing the lack of cytotoxicity .
Finally , the level of TF mRNA transcripts in human monocytes was similar in cells treated with LPS in the presence or absence of NAC ( Fig 5C ) .
Thus , the effects of antioxidants on human cells appear to recapitulate those observed in murine cells , thereby justifying further study in these cells .

There was no evidence of degraded immunoreactive TF in NAC-treated cells .
Incubation of preformed TF with NAC also had no effect on the reactivity of the antibody ( data not shown ) .
Release of TNF by LPS-treated cells .
To discern whether the inhibitory effect of PDTC and NAC on TF expression was caused by a global effect on protein synthesis , the effect of these antioxidant molecules on release of TNF was studied .
As shown in Fig 8A , PDTC augmented LPS-stimulated TNF release from murine macrophages , whereas PDTC alone had no effect on basal TNF levels .
By contrast , NAC did not alter either basal or LPS-stimulated TNF release ( Fig 8B ) .
Northern blot analysis showed that PDTC augmented TNF mRNA accumulation in LPS-treated murine cells , over the time course of augmented TNF release ( Fig 9A ) .

( C ) Medium ; ( & ) NAC ( 30 mmol/L ) .
( t = 3 hours , see Fig 1 ) is consistent with the notion that the agents exerted their effects via their antioxidant proper-ties .
In addition , structural analogues of PDTC without antioxidant activity had no effect on TF .
Finally , the antioxidants had a differential effect on TNF secretion compared with TF expression in murine macrophages .
Although both PDTC and NAC inhibited LPS-induced TF , stimulated TNF release BRISSEAU ET AL was either comparable or increased in the presence of NAC and PDTC , respectively .
Inhibition of TF expression appeared to be unrelated to alterations in gene transcription , because neither agent reduced the level of TF gene transcripts compared with cells treated with LPS alone in either the murine or human system .
Rather , the effect appeared to be posttranscriptional .
Several precedents exist whereby the redox state of the cell might modulate posttranscriptional events .
The redox state has been shown to alter mRNA stability , '' to modulate transla-tion , ** and to affect posttranslational modification of newly synthesized proteins . ''
Finally , the redox potential might directly affect the functional activity of the completely processed mature protein .
The observation that the accumulation of mRNA for TF in LPS-treated cells was equivalent in either the presence and absence of antioxidants suggests that an effect on mRNA stability is unlikely .
Furthermore , the addition of NAC to commercially acquired rabbit brain thromboplastin or to presynthesized cell-associated TF had no effect on its procoagulant function , indicating that direct reduction of the active glycoprotein did not alter function .
Thus , it is unlikely that the antioxidants directly altered the activity of membrane-associated TF .
The findings are more consistent with either reduced translation of the mRNA or some posttranslational alteration of the protein .
The observation that TNF release was normal or increased in LPS-treated cells exposed to both antioxidants indicates that the transla-tional machinery remained intact despite exposure to these molecules .
However , this does not rule out the possibility that these agents might have a specific effect on the translation of the mRNA for TF .
Although Western blot analysis of cells treated with LPS plus NAC showed no evidence of the fully glycosylated mature form of TF , there was also no accumulation of the less mature forms .
This observation is consistent with reduced translation and/or degradation of the newly translated protein , a phenomenon that likely occurred within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .
Recent studies have reported that the stability of proteins retained in the ER was sensitive to redox conditions . ''
Specifically , induction of reducing conditions within the ER promoted protein degradation .
These investigators showed that the addition of reduced glutathione to permeabilized CHO cells caused a marked reduction in the half-life of IL-2 receptor in the ER .
The mechanism behind this reduction is unclear , although reduction of disulfide bonds formed in the normally oxidizing conditions in the ER may lead to unfolding of proteins , retention in the ER , and enhanced degradation .
* '' * '' In this regard , two disulfide bonds ( between Cys-49 and Cys-57 and between Cys-186 and Cys-209 ) exist within the extracellular domain of TF . ''
Prevention of disulfide linkages by altering the redox state of the cell may underlie the effect of antioxidants on TF expression .
In contrast to TF , TNF secretion was unaffected by NAC .
This observation may be accounted for by the absolute or relative resistance of some proteins to proteo-lytic degradation by ER proteases , even under reducing conditions . ''
Alternatively , the fact that TNF contains only one disulfide bond may account for its resistance compared with TF . ''
This differential effect may be similar to that reported From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Effect of PDTC on levels of TNF mRNA in murine macrophages ( A ) or in human monocytes ( B ) .
Murine macrophages or human monocytes were unstimulated or treated with LPS ( 10 pg/mL ) in the presence or absence of PDTC ( 1 mmol/L added at t = 0 hour ) for 4 hours .
Levels of TNF and « -tubulin mRNA were evaluated by Northern analysis using the cDNA probe for murine TNF or human TNF and rat a-tubulin , respectively , as described in the Materials and Methods .
A representative blot of three ( A ) or six ( B ) independent studies is illustrated .
by Lentz and Sadler® showing that homocysteine caused retention of the immature form of von Willebrand factor within the ER of endothelial cells with subsequent degrada-tion , whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was normally secreted .
Further studies are required to define the precise mechanism of the effect observed in the present studies .
In human monocytes , NAC reduced LPS-induced expression of the 47-kD form of TF almost back to control levels ( Fig 7 ) , whereas the mean reduction in functional activity by the addition of NAC was approximately 65 % ( Fig 5A ) .
Based on neutralizing studies using antihuman TF antibody , the residual procoagulant activity was almost entirely caused by TF activity .
The difference between the mean functional activity from several experiments and the TF antigen expression shown in the single Western blot study NAC-treated cells is caused by day-to-day variability in the inhibitory effect of NAC .
The Western blot shown in Fig 7 corresponds to an experiment in which there was an 89 % reduction in functional PCA after NAC treatment .
ROS have been implicated as second messengers during cell activation .
Direct application of oxidant molecules or other oxidant stresses induces translocation of transcriptional activating factors such as AP-1 and NF-KB into the nucleus and the initiation of gene transcription .
* ' '' Incubation with antioxidants during cell stimulation has been shown to prevent DNA binding and transcriptional activation by NF-kB for some genes , '' `` '' * '' but not for others . '' ''
Furthermore , in a somewhat paradoxical fashion , antioxidants such as PDTC and NAC have been reported to have a stimulatory effect on transactivation by AP-1 . ''
In the present studies , both PDTC and NAC caused a slight increase in the LPS-induced increase in levels of TF mRNA in murine cells .
Similarly , NAC alone caused a small increase in the level of TF mRNA transcripts in murine cells , although this was not observed in human cells .
Because binding of both NF- « B and AP-1 consensus sequences in the promoter region of the TF gene participate in the induction of TF gene transcription , '' '' these data suggest that increased AP-1 binding may have accounted for the direct effect of NAC and also may have acted to compensate for the antioxidant-mediated reduction in NF-KB binding in LPS-treated cells , resulting in no overall alteration in the level of TF transcripts .

1034 of immunoreactive TNF by murine macrophages stimulated with LPS .
These observations concur with those recently reported by Schmalbach et al '' '' showing the ability of diethy } -dithiocarbamate to augment levels of TNF mRNA in HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes .
The mechanism underlying this effect remains undefined , although antioxidant-induced AP-1 binding may be contributory , '' given that TNF gene transcription is at least partly dependent on an AP-1 site in the promoter .
`` * '' '' The results in murine cells differ from those recently reported by Ziegler-Heitbrock et al '' and confirmed in the present studies , showing the ability of PDTC to inhibit TNF gene expression in LPS-stimulated human monocytes .
Species differences as well as differences in the level of activation of the cell ( thioglyco-late-elicited macrophages versus peripheral blood monocytes or monocytic cell line ) may account for these disparate find-ings .
In summary , the ability of antioxidants to modulate macrophage TF expression at a posttranscriptional level represents a novel mechanism whereby these agents might exert their effects on cell activation in response to microbial products .
The studies also suggest alternative clinical uses for antioxidant therapy .
Cell-mediated initiation of the coagulation cascade is an important mechanism underlying the fibrin deposition associated with multiple pathologic processes , including intraabdominal abscess formation , lung injury during sepsis , autoimmune renal disease , and various forms of arthritis .
Furthermore , because TF may also be expressed by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques , '' the data also point to a mechanism whereby antioxidants might abrogate acute thrombosis caused by ulceration of a plaque .
Studies using in vivo models of these disease processes are required to explore these possibilities .
