Antigen receptor signaling induces MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the BCL-6 transcription factor Huifeng Niu , Bihui H. Ye , and Riccardo Dalla-Favera ' Departments of Pathology and Genetics and Development , Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 USA The bel-6 proto-oncogene encodes a POZ/zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B and T cells and required for GC formation and antibody affinity maturation .
Deregulation of bel-6 expression by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations of the bei-6 promoter region are implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma .
The signals regulating bc/-6 expression are not known .
Here we show that antigen receptor activation leads to BCL-6 phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) .
Phosphorylation , in turn , targets BCL-6 for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway .
These findings indicate that BCL-6 expression is directly controlled by the antigen receptor via MAPK activation .
This signaling pathway may be crucial for the control of B-cell differentiation and antibody response and has im plications for the regulation of other POZ/zinc finger transcription factors in other tissues .

The bel-6 proto-oncogene was identified by virtue of its involvement in chromosomal translocations in diffuse large cell lymphoma ( DLCL ) , the most common form of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) ( Baron et al .
1993 ; Kerckaert et al .
1993 ; Ye et al .
1993 ; Miki et al .
1994 ) .
Subsequent studies have demonstrated that rearrangements of the bel-6 gene can be found in 30 % -40 % of DLCL and in a minority ( 5 % -10 % ) of follicular lymphoma ( FL ) ( Bastard et al .
1994 ; LoCoco et al .
1994 ; Otsuki et al .
1995 ) .
These rearrangements juxtapose heterologous promoters , derived from other chromosomes , to the bel-6 coding domain , causing its deregulated expression by a mechanism called promoter substitution ( Ye et al .
1995 ; Chen et al .
1998 ) .
The 5 ' noncoding region of the bel-6 gene can also be altered by somatic point mutations that are detectable , independent of re-arrangements , in ~70 % DLCL , 45 % FL , and AIDS-asso-ciated NHL ( Migliazza et al .
1995 ; Gaidano et al .
1997 ) .
Taken together , rearrangements and mutations of the bel-6 promoter region represent the most frequent genetic alteration in human B-cell malignancies , suggesting they may be important for tumorigenesis ( Dalla-Fa-vera et al .
1996 ) .
The BCL-6 protein is a nuclear phosphoprotein belonging to the POZ/zinc finger ( ZF ) family of transcription factors ( Kerckaert et al .

It contains six Kmippel-type carboxy-terminal zinc finger ( ZF ) motifs that have been shown to recognize specific DN A sequences in vitro ( Chang et al .
1996 ; Seyfert et al .
1996 ) and an amino-terminal POZ motif ( Al-bagli et al .
1995 ) shared by various ZF molecules including the Drosophila developmental regulators Tram track and Broad-com plex ( Harrison and Travers 1990 ; DiBello et al .
1991 ) , the human KUP ( Chardin et al .
1991 ) , ZID ( Bardwell and Treisman 1994 ) , and PLZF ( Chen et al .
1993 ) proteins as well as by POX viruses ( Koonin et al .
1992 ) and the actin-binding Drosophila oocyte protein Keich ( Xue and Cooley 1993 ) .
BCL-6 functions as a potent transcriptional repressor by binding to its DN A target sequence ( Deweindt et al .
1995 ; Chang et al .
1996 ; Seyfert et al .
1996 ) .
BCL-6 is an important regulator of lymphoid development and function .
In the B-cell lineage , the BCL-6 protein is found only in B cells within germinal centers ( GC ) , but not in pre-B cells or in differentiated progeny such as plasm a cells .
In the T-cell lineage , BCL-6 protein is detectable in cortical thymocytes and in CD4* T cells within GC as well as scattered in the perifollicular area ( Cattoretti et al .
1995 ; Onizuka et al .
1995 ; Allman et al .
1996 ) .
Mice deficient in BCL-6 display normal B-cell , T-cell , and lymphoid organ development but have a selective defect in T-cell-dependent antibody responses because of the inability of follicular B cells to proliferate and form GC ( Dent et al .
1997 ; Ye et al .
1997 ) .
In addition , BCL-6-deficient mice develop an inflammatory re GENES & DEVELOPMENT 12:1953-1961 © 1998 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/98 $ 5.00 ; www.genesdev.org 1953 Niu et al .
sponse in multiple organs characterized by infiltration of eosinophils and IgE-bearing B lymphocytes typical of a Th2-mediated inflammatory response .
These pheno-types may be explained by the ability of BCL-6 to bind the STAT-6 DNA-binding site and repress transcription activated by STAT-6 , the main nuclear effector of IL-4 signaling ( Dent et al .
1997 ; Ye et al .
1997 ) .
The expression and requirement of BCL-6 during GC formation and its alteration in GC-derived lymphoma suggest that BCL-6 may be a key regulator of GC development and antibody-mediated immune response .
Toward the elucidation of the signals that regulate GC expression , we report here the identification of a signaling pathway by which B-cell antigen receptor directly regulates BCL-6 stability .
Results Recent studies have shown that the BCL-6 protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites by mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , ERK-1 and ERK-2 , but not by Jun amino-terminal kinase ( JNK ) in vitro and in vivo ( Moriyama et al .
1997 ) .
The results shown in Figure 1 confirm that purified recombinant MAPK ( ERK-2 ) can phosphorylate GST-BCL-6 fusion proteins in vitro .
The phosphorylation targets were mapped to the amino-terminal half of the molecule since a carboxy-terminal deletion mutant ( GST -BCL-6AZF ) could be phosphorylated at levels comparable to the wild-type molecule , whereas an amino-terminal deletion mutant ( GST-BCL-6ZF ) could not be phosphorylated at all ( Fig .
1B ) Because BCL-6 contains two perfect consensus sites ( PXSP ) for MAPK-mediated phosphorylation ( see Fig .
1A ) , we generated two mutants ( BCL-6a1,533 and BCL-6a12333,343 ) iN which one or both of these sites were altered by substituting serines with alanines .
These two mutants were phosphorylated at much lower levels than wild-type BCL-6 , with BCL-6a1,533,343 displaying the lowest levels ( Fig .
1C ) .
This result indicates that the Sers ; , and Serg,4 ; residues represent a significant fraction , although not all , of the BCL-6 phosphorylation target sites .
The residual low level of phosphorylation is consistent with the existence of additional potential MAPK target sequences ( SP ) clustered within the central domain of the BCL-6 molecule .
MA PK-m ediated phosphorylation induces BCL-6 degradation To determine the effects of MAPK-mediated phosphorylation on be/-6 expression and function , 293T cells ( which do not express endogenous BCL-6 ) were cotransfected with vectors expressing BCL-6 , and a MEK ( MAP/ ERK kinase ) mutant ( MEK-2E ) that functions as a constitutively active MAPK kinase ( Yan and Templeton 1994 ) .
Western blot analysis of transfected cell extracts showed that MEK-2E expression ( documented by increased ERK2 kinase activity of MEK-2E transfected cell extracts in solid-phase kinase assays in vitro ; Fig .
2A , bottom ) induced a dramatic reduction of BCL-6 , but not ERK , levels ( Fig .
2A , top and middle ) .
The observed reduction in BCL-6 protein levels was dependent upon the phosphorylation activity of MEK-2E , since it did not occur when a vector expressing inactive MEK was cotransfected with bel-6 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Northern blot analysis of the same transfected cells showed that the reduction in BCL-6 protein levels were not caused by decreased bel-6 m RN A levels ( Fig .
2B , bottom ) .
Furthermore , the MEK-2E-induced decrease in BCL-6 levels was dependent on target phosphorylation , as the partial phosphorylation-resistant mutant BCL-6a ; , ; 33,343 Was partially resistant to MEK-2E-mediated down-regulation ( Fig .
2C ) .
These results indicate that the MEK-2E-induced decrease in BCL-6 levels is not caused by decreased gene transcription or protein synthesis , but rather by decreased protein stability .

( Bottom ) The results of densitometric scanning of the autoradiography ; analogous results were obtained in three independent experiments .
( D ) Analysis of BCL-6 transrepression activity in the presence of active MEK .
293T cells were transfected with 2.0 pmole of B6BS-TK-Luc , 0.04 pmole of pMT2T-BCL-6 ( lanes 2-8 ) or pMT2T-BCL- ( Lanes 11-14 ) and increasing amounts ( 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.4 pmole ) of MEK-2E ( lanes 3-5,9,12-14 ) or MEK ( lanes 6-8,10 ) as indicated .
Cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection and luciferase activities were measured by a luminometer .
Consistent with the MEK-2E-induced reduction in BCL-6 levels , a transient cotransfection assay in 293T cells showed that MEK-2E , but not MEK , could eliminate the transcriptional transrepressor activity of wild-type BCL-6 ( Fig .
2D , lanes 3-5 ) on a reporter vector expressing the luciferase gene downstream to the BCL-6 DNA-binding site ( B6BS ) ( Chang et al .
1996 ) ; the partial phosphorylation-resistant mutant BCL-6a1,333,343 WAS partially resistant to MEK-2E ( Fig .
2D , lanes 12-14 ) .
Overall , these results indicate that MAPK activation leads to functional inactivation of BCL-6 by causing its accelerated degradation .
BCL-6 degradation is mediated by ubiquitin/ proteasome pathw ay In examining the possible mechanisms for MAPK-mediated degradation of BCL-6 , we noted that the cluster of MAPK putative phosphorylation sites are em bedded in a region enriched in proline , glutamine , and serine , within which we identified three typical PEST sequences that score 9.4 , 5.0 , and 2.6 , respectively ( Fig .
3A ; any score above zero denotes a possible PEST region ; scores greater than five indicate the strongest candidates ) .
These motifs have been demonstrated to represent targets for regulated protein degradation ( Rogers et al .
1986 ; Rechsteiner and Rogers 1996 ) .
To determine whether MAPK-mediated BCL-6 degradation targeted these PEST sequences , we constructed vectors expressing two epitope HA-tagged bel-6 deletion mutants ( see Fig .
3A ) and cotransfected them with the MEK-2E vector into 293T cells .
Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies ( Fig .
3B ) showed that MEK-2E-mediated degradation targeted the amino-terminal half of the molecule and it was completely abolished in the BCL-6A @ 300-417 ) internal deletion mutant that lacks a small portion of the BCL-6 pro GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1955 Niu et al .

( B ) 293T cells were transfected with 5 ug of pMT2T vectors expressing HA-BCL-6 ( lanes 1-3 ) , HA-BCL-6A ( 300-417 ) ( Lanes 4-6 ) , or HA-BCL-6ZF ( lanes 7-9 ) in the absence of MEK-2E ( lanes 1,4,7 ) or in the H & A presence of increasing amount ( 5 , 10 ug ) of 97 MEK-2E ( lanes 2,5,8,3,6,9 ) .
Forty-eight hours after transfection , equal amounts of cell lysates were analyzed ( after normalization for transfection efficency based on B-galactosidase activity of cotransfected plas-mids ) by 8 % SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-HA ( 12CA5 ) antibodies .
tein containing all three PEST sequences .
These results indicate that MAPK-induced phosphorylation and degradation of BCL-6 target PEST sequences located in the same domain as the MAPK phosphorylation sites .
The involvement of PEST sequences suggested that MAPK-induced BCL-6 degradation could be mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway ( Hochstrasser 1996 ) .
Therefore , we tested whether MEK-2E mediated degradation of BCL-6 in transfected 293T cells could be inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor Cbz-LLL ( MG132 ) ( Kim and Maniatis 1996 ; Palom bella et al .
1994 ; Rock et al .
1994 ) .
Figure 4A shows that BCL-6 degradation was completely inhibited by MG132 , but not by DMSO ( solvent control ) or calpain inhibitor II ( CI II ) , a cysteine-protease inhibitor ( Kim and Maniatis 1996 ; Palombella et al .
1994 ) .
Because the addition of multiple ubiquitins to the proteolysis substrate is a key step preceding target degradation by the proteasome , we then tested whether BCL-6/ubiquitin conjugates in vivo could be detected .
To this end , 293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing BCL-6 , MEK-2E , and epitope ( His , ) -tagged ubiquitin in the presence or absence of MG132 .
Cell lysates were subjected to imm with anti-BCL-6 antibodies , and the im munoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibodies .
Figure 4B shows that in the absence of MG132 , low levels of BCL-6/ubiquitin were detectable when BCL-6 1956 GENES & DEVELOPMENT MEK-2E 1 POZ L & + ++ < HA-BCL-6 € HA-BCL-6A ( 300-17 ) CDAD and ubiquitin were coexpressed with exogenous MEK-2E ( lane 4 ) ; in the presence of MG132 , typical ladders representing multi-ubiquitinated forms of BCL-6 were detectable at high levels in the presence of MEK-2E ( lane 8 ) ; low levels were detectable also in its absence ( lane 7 ) , suggesting that the normal turnover of BCL-6 degradation may be mediated by basal levels of endogenous MAPK activity .
Based on the specific pharmacological inhibition and the detection of MEK-2E-inducible BCL-6/ubiquitin conjugates , we conclude that MAPK-induced phosphorylation induces degradation of BCL-6 via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway .
MA PK-m ediated phosphorylation and degradation of BCL-6 is induced by antigen-receptor signaling in B cells To demonstrate the physiological significance of MAPK-mediated phosphorylation/degradation of BCL-6 in B cells , we treated a B-cell lymphoma cell line ( Ramos ) with anti-IgM antibodies , a treatment that mimics B-cell antigen-receptor signaling and specifically activates MAPK ( ERK2 ) ( Gold et al .
1992 ; Sakata et al .
1995 ; Sutherland et al .
1996 ) .
As previously demonstrated , an in vitro assay showed that ERK2 kinase activity was rapidly increased 5 min after anti-IgM treatment ( Fig .

5A ) and by the disappearance of BCL-6 , but not ERK2 .
In the same experiment , Northern blot analysis showed that bel-6 mRN A levels did not change during anti-IgM treatment of Ram os cells ( Fig .
5A , bottom ) .
To determine whether hyperphosphorylation was associated with increased BCL-6 instability , we analyzed the half-life of BCL-6 in anti-IgM -treated Ram os cells by a `` pulse-chase '' labeling experiment .
The results ( Fig .
5B ) showed that the hyperphosphorylated ( slow-migrating ) forms of BCL-6 were significantly less stable than the hypophosphorylated ( fast-migrating ) forms ( half life 4-6 hr ) Anti-IgM-induced BCL-6 degradation was dependent on phosphorylation as it was inhibited by a specific MAPK inhibitor PDO098059 ( Fig .
5C ) ( Dudley et al .
1995 ; Pang et al .
1995 ) , and was mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway since it was specifically inhibited by MG132 ( Fig .
5D ) .
Finally , anti-IgM treatment of Ramos cells stably transfected with cadmium inducible vectors expressing HA-tagged wild-type , 333/343 mutant , or amino-terminal Regulation of BCL-6 by antigen receptor signaling deleted BCL-6 proteins showed that degradation required phosphorylation of the 333 and 343 serines as well as the amino-terminal half of BCL-6 containing the PEST motifs ( Fig .
5B ) .
These results demonstrate that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of BCL-6 and its degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway represent a physi-ologic pathway that can be activated by antigen-receptor signling in B cells .
Discussion The present study identifies a signal transduction pathway by which the antigen receptor regulates the stability of the BCL-6 transcription factor in B cells .
The results have im plications for the normal mechanism regulating GC formation as well as for the role of deregulated bel-6 expression in lymphomas deriving from GC B cells .
In addition , several observations suggest that MAPK-mediated regulation of POZ/Zinc finger protein stability may represent a general , highly conserved regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells .
Regulation of BCL-6 stability during GC form ation The finding that antigen-receptor-induced activation of MAPK leads to BCL-6 degradation must be seen in the context of the complex network of signals modulating receptor signaling in GC Bcells ( Tedder et al .
1997 ; Cam-bier 1997 ) .
During GC formation , activation of this pathway is consistent with the observation that pre-GC B cells in the follicular mantle zone , the site where B cells encounter the antigen , express bel/-6 RNA , but not the BCL-6 protein ( Allman et al .
1996 ; Cattoretti et al .
1995 ) .
Within the GC , the coexistence of antigen and bel-6 expression implies that antigen-receptor signaling must be modulated by mechanisms that allow BCL-6 stability .
These mechanisms may include down-regulation of antigen-receptor expression in centroblasts ( MacLennan 1994 ) , modulation of receptor signaling by CD22 or Fc y receptor ( Tedder et al .
1997 ; Cam bier 1997 ) , and the activity of de-ubiquitinases ( DUB ) , which regulate substrate ubiquitination and are induced by cytokines acting on GC B cells ( Zhu et al .
1996 ) .
During post-GC differentiation , antigen-induced degradation may serve as a rapid mechanism to down-regulate be/-6 expression , in synergy with transcriptional down-regulation by CD40 signaling ( Allman et al .
1996 ; Cattoretti et al .
1997 ) .
Finally , the regulation of BCL-6 stability during GC development is likely to be affected by various additional signals that activate MAPK in B cells , including various cytokines ( TNF , IL-6 , IL-2 ) ( Vietor et al .
1993 ; Minami et al .
1994 ; Fukada et al .
1996 ) .
The effect of these signals on the pathway linking the antigen receptor to BCL-6 can be tested in the experimental systems used in this study .
Im plication for lym phom agenesis Most B-cell lymphoma types , FL , DLCL , and Burkitt ( BL ) lymphoma , are thought to derive from the GC B cells .

BCL-6 is phosphorylated and degraded by antigen-receptor signaling in B cells .
Ramos cells ( 1 x 10°/m1 ) were treated with anti-IgM ( 10 ug/m1 ) and harvested at different time points after treatment as indicated .
( 4 ) ( Top three panels ) Equal amounts of cell extracts were used for Western blot analysis using anti-BCL-6 ( top ) , or anti-ERK2 ( middle ) antibodies , and for solid-phase ERK2 kinase assays ( MBP , bottom ) .
Equal amounts of RN As ( 10 ug ) were used for Northern blot analysis with BCL-6 or GAPDH probes ( bottom ) .

Ramos cells were pulse labeled for 1 hr with [ P°SJmethionine and RSJcysteine , and then treated with anti-IgM ( 10 ug/ml ) for 30 min and subsequently incubated in the presence of an excess of nonradioactive methionine and cysteine for the indicated times ( chase ) .
Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-BCL-6 antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography .

( E ) Mutant BCL-6 proteins are resistant to anti-IgM-induced degradation .
Ramos cells stably transfected with pHeBo-MT-HA-BCL6 , pHeBo-MT-HA-BCL-6a ; ,553,343 and pHeBo-MT-HA-BCL6ZF were treated with 1 um CdCl , for 6 hr to induce exogenous BCL-6 expression .
Cells were then treated wth anti-IgM ( 10 ug/m1 ) and harvested at different time points as indicated .
Equal amounts of cell extracts were loaded on 7 % ( HA-BCL-6 or HA-BCL-6a1,333,343 ) or 10 % SDS-PAGE ( HA-BCL-6ZF ) and the amount of exogenous BCL-6 proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA antibodies ( 12CA5 ) .
regulatory region are found most frequently in DLCL and FL , all GC-derived lymphomas , including those carrying a structurally normal bei-6 gene , express the BCL-6 protein ( Cattoretti et al .
1995 ) .
This implies that the BCL-6 protein is stable in tumor cells and suggests that MAPK-mediated degradation may be blocked by genetic or epi-genetic alterations affecting the pathway leading to BCL-6 degradation .
The observation that BCL-6 degradation can be triggered from the cell surface by activation of the antigen receptor has potential relevance for the therapy of B-cell lymphoma .
1958 GENES & DEVELOPMENT MA PK-m ediated regulation of POZ/zinc finger transcription factors MAPK is a ubiquitous , evolutionarily conserved signal transducer that is activated by heterogeneous signals that originate from the cell membrane and are trans-duced to MAPK via RAS proteins ( Gold and Matsuuchi 1995 ; Alberola-lla et al .
1997 ) .
Accordingly , POZ/zinc finger proteins represent a large family of highly conserved transcription factors including Drosophila cell fate regulators such as Tram track and Broad-com plex , as well as human cancer-associated proteins such as BCL-6 and PLZF .
These molecules have strong structural ( POZ and ZF domains ) , as well as functional homologies being transcriptional repressors that control cell differentiation ( Chen et al .
1994 ; Emery et al .
1994 ; Albagli et al .

Most notably , POZ finger proteins also carry possible MAPK phosphorylation sites and PEST sequences in approximately the same position as those carried by BCL-6 ( H. Niu et al. , unpubl . ) .
In Drosophila , degradation of TTK88 , a POZ/zinc finger inhibitor of neural-cell differentiation , has been shown to be mediated by MAPK ( Li et al .
1997 ; Tang et al .
1997 ) .
Thus , degradation of POZ/zinc finger transcription factors may represent a general mechanism by which the RAS/ MAPK pathway controls cell function and differentiation .

The point mutations ( Ala333 , Ala343 ) were generated by PCR-based methods ; the sequence of the resulting plasmids was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis .
pMT2T-BCL-6 and B6BS-TK-LUC have been described as previous ( Chang et al .
1996 ) pMT2T-BCL-Saiass3,343 was constructed by transferring the Bell-N.eol !
fragments of plasmid into the pMT2T-BCL-6 vector .
MEK-2E-EE-CMV and MEK-EE-CMV for expressing of constitutively active or inactive MEK were provided by Dr. D. Templeton ( Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , OH ) .
The pMT2T-HA-BCL-6 , pMT2T-HA-BCL-6A ( 300-417 ) , and pMT2T-HA-BCL-6ZF vectors were constructed by inserting the sequences encoding the HA epitope upstream and in frame with bel-6 coding sequences .
Deletion mutants of bel-6 were produced by PCR-based methods and confirmed by sequencing .
Hisg-ubiquitin-CMV was kindly provided by T. Maniatis ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) .
Episomally replicating plasmid pHeBo-MT , which carries EBV oriP , hygromycin B , and MT promoter efficiently yields hygro-mycin-resistant colonies .
ERK2 kinase assays BCL-6 GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads as suggested by the manufacturer ( Pharmacia Biotech ) .
Recombinant ERK2 ( New England Biolabs ) assays were performed as suggested by the manufacturer using purified wild-type and mutant GST fusion proteins as substrates .
In Regulation of BCL-6 by antigen receptor signaling solid-phase ERK2 kinase assays , cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer ( 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X-100 , 150 mm NaCl , 100 mm NaF , 5 um ZnCl ; , , 1 mM Na , ; VO , , 10 mM EGTA , 2 mm PMSF , 1 ug/ml aprotinin , 1 ug/ml leupeptin , and 1 ug/ml pepstatin ) and centrifuged at 100,000g for 15 min at 4°C .
The supernatant ( 250-500 ug cellular protein ) was then im munoprecipitated using anti-ERK2 antibodies ( C-14 ) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B .
Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer ( 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5 , 10 mm MnCl ; , 5 mm MgCl , ) .
Reactions were initiated by adding 50 ul kinase buffer containing substrate MBP , 5 um ATP , and 5 uCi [ y-°PJATP .
After 15 min at 37°C , reactions were terminated by adding 2x SDS-PAGE sample buffer .
Samples were electrophoresed on 15 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels which were then dried and analyzed by autoradiography .
Cell transfection 293T cells , grown in DMEM , 10 % FBS , were transfected transiently with various DN A vectors using standard calcium phosphate precipitation methods .
Ramos cells , grown in IMDM , 10 % FBS , were transfected stably with the plasm id pHeBo-MT-HA-BCL-6 , pHeBo-MT-HA-BCL-6a ) ,3533,343 and the deletion-mutant construct pHeBo-MT-HA-BCL-6ZF by electroporation followed by selection in hygromycin B ( 400 ug/ml ) .
HA-bel-6 gene expression under control of the metallothionein ( MT ) promoter were induced by adding 1 um of CdCl , .
Northern and Western blot analysis Total RNA were isolated from cells by using Trizol-reagents ( GIBCO-BRL ) and equal amounts of RN A were separated on 1 % formaldehyde-agarose gel .
Northern blot analysis was performed by using standard methods with full-length bel-6 cDNA as probes and normalized by GAPDH hybridization .
Whole-cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in RIPA buffer with 2 mM PMSF , 1 ug/ml aprotinin , 1 ug/ml of leupeptin , 1 ug/ml pep-statin , 1 mM Na , VO , , 5 mM NaF , and 10 mm B-glycerophos-phate .
For transient transfectants , protein amounts loaded on gel were normalized by transfection efficiency ( B-gal activity ) .
For Ramos cells and their stable transfectants ( untreated or treated ) , equal amounts of protein were analyzed by 8 % or 10 % SDS-PAGE , and subsequently by Western blot analysis using anti-BCL-6 ( N-70-6 ) , anti-ERK2 ( C-14 ) , or anti-HA ( 12CA5 ) antibodies at 1:3000 , 1:1000 , or 1:500 dilutions .
The results were visualized by ECL ( Amersham ) .
In vivo ubiquitination assay 293T cells were transfected transiently with pMT2T-BCL-6 , His , -ubiquitin-CMV , and MEK-2E-CMV vectors as indicated .
MG132 ( 50 um ) was added 8 hr after transfection .
The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant in all experiments by adding empty vector .
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with 10 mm N-ethylma-leimide and various protease inhibitors as described ( Pagano et al .
1995 ) .
The cell lysates were then im munoprecipitated using anti-BCL-6 antibodies .
The imm unoprecipitates were loaded on 6 % SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot analysis using the anti-ubiquitin antibodies ( Zymed ) at 1:1000 dilution as described ( Avantaggiati et al .
1996 ) .
Pulse-chase labeling experim ent Ramos cells ( 12 x 10 '' ) were collected by centrifugation , washed in PBS , resuspended in 100 ml of DMEM without methionine GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1959 Niu et al .
and cysteine ( GIBCO-BRL ) , and starved for 60 min .
nine and [ SSS ] cysteine ( 3 mCi ; ICN ) were added and pulse-la-beled for 60 min and then treated with anti-IgM for 30 min .
Cold methionine and cysteine were then added to final concentrations of 150 ug/m1 .
Cells were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors .
The cell ex-tracts , adjusted for equal cpm , were imm with anti-BCL-6 antibodies , and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography .
