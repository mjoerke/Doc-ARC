NEOPLASIA Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Hodgkin 's Disease Derives From Post-Germinal Center B Cells By Antonino Carbone , Annunziata Gloghini , Luigi M. Larocca , Andrea Antinori , Brunangelo Falini , Umberto Tirelli , Riccardo Dalla-Favera , and Gianluca Gaidano Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin 's disease ( HIV-HD ) displays several peculiarities when compared with HD of the general population .
These include overrepre-sentation of clinically aggressive histologic types and frequent infection of Reed-Sternberg ( RS ) cells by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
Recently , we have reported that the histogenesis of HD of the general population may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of BCL-6 , a transcription factor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B cells , and of CD138/ syndecan-1 ( syn-1 ) , a proteoglycan associated with post-GC , terminal B-cell differentiation .
In this study , we have applied these two markers to the study of HIV-HD histogenesis and correlated their expression status to the NDIVIDUALS INFECTED with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) are reported to be at increased risk of Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) .
HIV-associated HD ( HIV-HD ) displays several peculiarities when compared with HD of the general popula-tion. > '' First , HIV-HD exhibits an unusually aggressive clinical behavior , which mandates the use of specific therapeutic strategies and is associated with a poor prognosis . ''
Second , the pathologic spectrum of HIV-HD differs markedly from that of HD in the general population .
`` ** In particular , the aggressive histologic subtypes of classic HD ( CHD ) , namely mixed cellularity ( MC ) and lymphocyte depletion ( LD ) , predominate among HIV-HD and the tumor tissue is characterized by an unusually large proportion of neoplastic cells , termed Reed-Sternberg ( RS ) cells.8 The biologic reasons for the clinicopathologic peculiarities of HIV-HD are known only in part and may reflect peculiarities in the tumor microenvironment , as well as in the tumor clone .
In fact , on the one hand , the HIV-HD microenvironment is characterized by inversion of the CD4*/CD8* T-cell ratio , whereas CD4* T cells predominate in the microenvironment of CHD in the general population . '' ''
On the other hand , the overwhelming majority of HIV-HD is associated with RS cell infection by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , which is restricted to a fraction of CHD in the general population . '' ''
Because RS cells of EBV-positive HIV-HD express the virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) , EBV is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease .
During the last few years , molecular investigations have documented that RS cells of most HD of the general population derive from germinal center ( GC ) -related B cells that have been stimulated and selected by Recently , we have shown that the precise differentiation stage of RS cells can be reliably identified based on the expression profile of BCL-6 and CD138/syndecan-1 ( syn-1 ) . ' ''
The BCL-6 protein is a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor encoded by the BCL-6 proto-oncogene and is implicated in normal GC formation and function .
'* '' In the B-cell compartment , BCL-6 expression clusters with GC B cells , whereas it is negative in all other stages of B-cell differentiation , including virgin and memory B cells and plasma cells . ''
Expression of BCL-6 in GC B cells is Blood , Vol 93 , No 7 ( April 1 ) , 1999 ; pp 2319-2326 virologic features of this disease .
We have found that RS cells of all histologic categories of HIV-HD consistently display the BCL-6-/syn-1* phenotype and thus reflect post-GC B cells .
Although BCL-6-/ syn-1+* RS cells of HIV-HD express CD40 , they are not surrounded by CD40 ligand , positive ( CD40L+ ) reactive T lymphocytes , which , in HD of the general population , are thought to regulate the disease phenotype through CD40/CD4O0L interactions .
Conversely , RS cells of virtually all HIV-HD express the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LM P1 ) , which , being functionally homologous to CD40 , may contribute , at least in part , to the modulation of the HIV-HD phenotype .

downregulated upon challenge with antigen or via the CD40/ CD40 ligand ( CD4O0L ) pathway . ''
Similarly , downregulation of BCL-6 is caused by expression of LMP 1 in B cells reflecting the GC phenotype . ''
Syn-1 is a member of the syndecan family of proteoglycans , which are implicated in cell-extracellular matrix interactions . ''
Among mature B cells , expression of syn-1 clusters with late stages of B-cell differentiation , namely immunoblasts and plasma cells , whereas it is negative in GC B cells.2124 Here , we aimed to define the histogenesis of HIV-HD .
We report that RS cells of HIV-HD consistently express the BCL-6~/syn-1 * profile and thus reflect post-GC B cells .

RS cells of HIV-HD consistently express LMP1 , which may contribute to the modulation of the RS cell phenotype in this context .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples This study was based on 27 lymph node samples involved in HD from patients with HIV infection .
All cases were histologically classified as CHD .
In particular , the panel included 7 HD with B-cell phenotype ( 3 MC and four LD ) and 20 HD with undetermined ( non-B/non-T-cell ) phenotype ( 2 nodular sclerosis [ NS ] , 13 MC , and 5 LD ) ( Table 1 ) .
No cases of HIV-HD with a T-cell phenotype were studied .
Frozen tissue samples were available in 12 cases ; for the other samples , formalin- or Bouin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue sections were available .
The CD30+ , CD45~ , CD15* , epithelial membrane antigen ( EMA ) ~ diagnostic profile was required for the diagnosis of HD . ''
The Rye modification of the Lukes and Butler classification was used to classify the histologic subtypes of HD . ''
Distinct nodule and collagen-band formation was required to diagnose the NS subtype , whereas lymph node biopsies characterized by increased fibrohistiocytoid stromal cells Table 1 .

In serial tissue sections from each case , the same areas were evaluated for lymphocytes expressing CD3 , CD4O0L , CD4 , and CD8 .
A total of 10 fields were evaluated ( magnification X63 ) .
The percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD4OL was counted on the total of CD3+* T cells .
Five lymph node samples involved in CHD from patients without HIV infection were also studied for control purposes ( Table 2 ) .
Two-Color Staining Multiple immunocytochemical staining was performed to detect BCL-6 plus LMP1 or BCL-6 plus syn-1 as previously described . ''
Briefly , sections were first incubated for 1 hour with BCL-6 MoAb at room temperature and then immunostained by the APAAP method '' '' using naphthol AS-MX phosphate along with fast blue BB salt ( Sigma Chemical , St Louis , MO ) for the development of alkaline phosphatase .
Subsequently , sections were treated twice for 5 minutes in citrate buffer ( pH 6 ) in a microwave oven to denature bound antibody molecules and to inactivate alkaline phosphatase present in the APAAP complex .
Finally , sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-LMP1 or anti-syn-1 MoAb and immunostained by the APAAP method using Table 2 .

Hybridization products were detected using an anti-FITC polyclonal antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) .
Nitro Blue Tetra-zolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet ( NBT/BCIP/INT ) was used as the chromogen .
In all samples , immunostaining for LMP1 was performed with a LMP1-specific antibody ( Dako ) on Bouin- or Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue sections as already described .
The percentage of LMP1+* neoplastic cells was assigned as follows : 0 % , less than 10 % , 10 % to 25 % , 25 % to 50 % , 50 % to 75 % , and greater than 75 % .
RESULTS Expression Profile of syn-1 and BCL-6 in HIV-HD RS cells and their variants expressed syn-1 in all cases of HIV-HD ( 27 of 27 , 100 % ) , which were representative of the entire pathologic spectrum of CHD subtypes .
The proportion of syn-1* RS cells was variable in different tumors ( Table 1 ) .
The pattern of syn-1 immunoreactivity in RS cells was consistent with cytoplasmic and membranous staining and displayed moderate to weak staining intensity ( Fig 1A ) .
Conversely , expression of BCL-6 by RS cells was negative in the overwhelming majority of HIV-HD cases ( 25 of 27 , 92.6 % ) .
Only two cases of HIV-HD ( two of 27 , 7.4 % ) displayed a low proportion of BCL-6+* RS cells ( < 10 % ) ( Table 1 ) .
In these two cases containing both syn-1* and BCL-6+* RS cells , double-staining experiments demonstrated that expression of the two antigens was mutually exclusive in the same RS cell ( Fig 1B ) .
Comparison of BCL-6 and syn-1 expression in each individual case of HD led to the identification of a dominant phenotypic profile of the disease , which was characterized by BCL-6~/syn-1* RS cells in the absence of BCL-6+/syn-1~ RS cells .
This profile clustered with 25 of 27 ( 92.6 % ) cases of HIV-HD .
A less frequent phenotypic profile was associated with two of 27 ( 7.4 % ) cases of HIV-HD ; it was characterized by a predominant population of BCL-6~-/syn-1* RS cells coexisting with a minor ( < 10 % ) population of BCL-6+*/syn-1~ RS cells in the same biopsy ( Table 1 ) .
Expression Profile of LMP 1 in HIV-HD RS cell infection by EBV was scored as positive in 25 of 27 ( 92.6 % ) HIV-HD cases assessed by EBER in situ hybridization ( Fig 1C ) .
EBV * HIV-HD cases displayed a variable proportion of RS cells expressing LMP 1 ( Fig 1D and Table 1 ) .
In HIV-HD cases displaying both LMP1* and BCL-6+* RS cells ( n = 2 ) , double-staining experiments ruled out the coexpression of BCL-6 and LMP1 by the same RS cell ( Fig 1E ) .
Both cases of HIV-HD lacking infection by EBV displayed only BCL-6~/ syn-1* RS cells .
As expected , LMP1 expression was not detected in these two cases .

2324 CD40/CD4O0L Interactions Between RS Cells and Reactive T Lymphocytes in HIV-HD CD40 was strongly expressed by RS cells from all cases of HIV-HD ( N= 27 ) , which were representative of the entire pathologic spectrum of CHD subtypes .
All HIV-HD cases consistently contained more than 50 % CD40+* RS cells ( Table 1 ) .
The pattern of CD40 immunoreactivity in RS cells was consistent with cytoplasmic and membranous staining and displayed strong staining intensity ( Fig 2A ) .
With respect to the reactive cellular background , the overwhelming majority of HIV-HD cases demonstrated inversion of the CD4*/CD8* T-cell ratio ( median tissue CD4+*/CD8+* T-cell ratio , 0.2 ; range , 0.05 to 1.47 ; Fig 2B , C , and D and Table 2 ) in all morphologic subtypes and all conventional phenotypes of the disease .
Among reactive T cells in the background , expression of CD40L occurred only rarely ( Fig 2E and Table 2 ) .
In particular , the rare CD4O0L+* T lymphocytes were distributed in a scattered fashion in the tumor tissue , and no rosetting of RS cells by CD40L+* T lymphocytes could be detected in any of the fields analyzed .
Overall , these data suggest that stable CD40/CDA40L interaction between RS cells and reactive T lymphocytes is not a feature of HIV-HD .
DISCUSSION The aim of this study was to investigate the histogenesis of HIV-HD .
The implications of our data are twofold .
First , all pathologic variants of HIV-HD are histogenetically homogeneous and reflect a post-GC phenotype .
Second , the histogenesis differs for HIV-HD versus HD in the general population because of differences in the composition of the reactive background and differences intrinsic to the neoplastic clone .
The profile of BCL-6 and syn-1 expression in the neoplastic cells of HIV-HD identifies a dominant phenotypic category of the disease , represented by the BCL-6~-/syn-1* pattern .
The association with the BCL-6~-/syn-1* profile suggests that RS cells of HIV-HD are histogenetically related to post-GC B cells , since in normal lymphoid tissues , the BCL-6~/syn-1* phenotypic pattern clusters selectively with B cells that have exited the GC and are differentiating toward the late stages of B-cell maturation . ''
The BCL-6~-/syn-1* phenotype in HIV-HD occurs throughout the pathologic spectrum of the disease , indicating that the different histologic variants of HIV-HD share a common histogenetic origin and the morphologic and architectural differences are not directly related to differences in histogenesis .
The BCL-6-/syn-1* phenotype of HIV-HD is distinct from the BCL-6*/syn-1~ phenotype of nodular lymphocyte predominance HD , but resembles the BCL-6~/syn-1* phenotype displayed by the majority of RS cells in CHD in the general population . ' '' '' ''
However , in CHD of the general population , BCL-6~/syn-1* RS cells frequently coexist with BCL-6*/syn-1~ RS cells in the same biopsy . ' ''
Conversely , the coexistence of BCL-6~-/syn-1* and BCL-6+/syn-1~ RS cells is exceptional in HIV-HD .
Conceivably , these phenotypic differences between HIV-HD and CHD of the general population reflect differences in the tumor microenvironment or in the neoplastic clone .
Signaling between neoplastic and reactive cells throughout stable CD40/CD4O0L interactions is a prominent feature of CHD CARBONE ET AL of the general population .
`` * '' '' Because triggering of CD40 causes downregulation of BCL-6 expression , '' > '' '' CD40/CD40L signaling is regarded as a major determinant of the RS cell phenotype in the context of CHD of the general population . '' ''
Although RS cells of HIV-HD express CD40 , CD4OL+* T lymphocytes are rare in this form of the disease , most likely as a consequence of CD4* T-cell depletion induced by HIV .
In particular , HIV-HD is characteristically devoid of CD4O0L+ T lymphocytes surrounding RS cells , a phenomenon known as rosetting and strictly correlated with the BCL-6~-/syn-1 * phenotype in CHD of the general population . ' ''
These data suggest that if CD40/CD40L interactions occur in HIV-HD , they are most likely transient and are not characterized by the stability displayed by similar interactions in CHD of the general population .
Because RS cells of HIV-HD express LMP 1 in the overwhelming majority of cases ( this study and others®* ) and because LMP1 is able to downregulate BCL-6 in B cells with a GC phenotype , '' '' it is possible that LMP1 contributes , at least in part , to modulation of the HIV-HD phenotype .
Although a formal proof of the activity of the LMP1 pathway in HIV-HD is presently lacking , recent data obtained in HIV-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas have demonstrated that LMP1 , when present , is able to activate its corresponding downstream signaling cascade . '' ''
In vivo , neoplastic B cells expressing LMP1 display the BCL-6~/syn-1* phenotype and are thought to reflect post-GC immunoblasts ( Fig 3 ) , as opposed to GC-unrelated immuno-pre-GC B-cells GC B-cells post-GC B-cells @ | BCL-6* BCL-6~ SYN-1- SYN-1* LMP-1- LMP-1* HIV-SNCCL HIV-HD HIV-LNCCL HIV-IBPL Fig 3 .
- Histogenetic model for HIV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders infected by EBV ( Carbone et al '' '' and this study ) .
The proposed model is based on the expression pattern of BCL-6 and CD138/syn-1 throughout physiologic B-cell differentiation .
B cells within the GC display the BCL-6+/syn-1~ phenotype , whereas B cells that have exited the GC and further matured toward the plasma cell stage exhibit the BCL-6~/syn-1* phenotype .
On these bases , HIV-associated systemic non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas displaying the BCL-6+/syn-1~ phenotype , ie , HIV-associated small noncleaved cell lymphoma ( HIV-SNCCL ) and HIV-associated large noncleaved cell lymphoma ( HIV-LNCCL ) , are postulated to originate from GC B cells .
Conversely , HIV-associated lymphomas displaying the BCL-6-/ syn-1* phenotype , ie , HIV-associated immunoblastic plasmacytoid lymphoma ( HIV-IBPL ) and HIV-HD , are postulated to derive from B cells that have transited through the GC and have undergone preterminal differentiation .
The post-GC nature of these lymphomas is formally documented , at least in the case of AIDS-IBPL , by the association with genotypic markers of GC transit , namely somatic hypermutation of Ig genes and mutations of BCL-6 5° noncoding regions .
The BCL-6-/syn-1+* phenotype is permissive for expression of the EBV-encoded LMP1 antigen .
Conversely , LMP1 expression is consistently absent among HIV-associated lymphomas displaying the BCL-6+/ syn-1~ phenotype .

HISTOGENESIS OF HIV+ HODGKIN 'S DISEASE blasts , based on their association with genotypic markers of B-cell transit through the GC , including mutations of Ig variable genes and mutations of BCL-6 5 '' noncoding regions . ''
The BCL-6~/syn-1* phenotype is also expressed by a significant proportion of RS cells of CHD of the general population , which may be considered post-GC cells since they harbor mutations of Ig variable genes and mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions .
'* '' '' These observations suggest that BCL-6~/syn-1*/ LMP1+ RS cells of HIV-HD are also derived from post-GC cells ( Fig 3 ) , although a formal demonstration of their association with genotypic markers of GC transition is presently lacking .
On these bases , it may be postulated that LMP1 expression contributes , at least in part , to modulation of the RS cell phenotype in HIV-HD .
According to this model , LMP1 expres-sion , presumably in cooperation with other cellular signals , would induce RS cells to downregulate BCL-6 , thus allowing further maturation of the tumor clone to assume a post-GC phenotype ( Fig 3 ) .
This model prompts investigations aimed at dissecting the signaling cascade mediated by LMP1 in the context of HIV-HD and at defining the precise pathway exploited for the modulation of RS cell phenotype in hosts infected with HIV . ''
