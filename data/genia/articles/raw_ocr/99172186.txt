To investigate the effect of NAC on the induction phase of T cell responses , we analyzed its action on human dendritic cells ( DC ) derived from adherent PBMC cultured with IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF .
We first found that NAC inhibited the constitutive as well as the LPS-induced activity of the transcription factor NF-KB .
In parallel , NAC was shown to down-regulate the production of cytokines by DC as well as their surface expression of HLA-DR , CD86 ( B7-2 ) , and CD40 molecules both at the basal state and upon LPS activation .
NAC also inhibited DC responses induced by CD40 engagement .
The inhibitory effects of NAC were not due to nonspecific toxicity as neither the viability of DC nor their mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis were modified by NAC .
Finally , we found that the addition of NAC to MLR between naive T cells and allogeneic DC resulted in a profound inhibition of alloreactive responses , which could be attributed to a defect of DC as APC-independent T cell responses were not inhibited by NAC .
Altogether , our results suggest that NAC might impair the generation of primary immune responses in humans through its inhibitory action on DC .

-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , '' an old medicine classically leed as a mucolytic agent , has recently gained new interest in view of its ability to inhibit HIV replication ( 1-6 ) and the synthesis of proinflammatory molecules ( reviewed in Ref .
7 ) .
These effects of NAC depend on its antioxidant properties related to the presence of a thiol group and resulting in inhibition of the activation of the transcription factor NF- « B ( reviewed in Ref .
8 ) .
Indeed , NF- « B activation is regulated by the redox potential of the cell and/or by the production of radical oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) ( reviewed in Refs .
9-11 ) .
In addition to its direct antioxidant properties , NAC also acts by increasing the cellular content in glutathione ( GSH ) , the major intracellular redox buffer ( 8 ) .
The GSH content of T cells has been shown to be critical for their responses to mitogenic stimuli ( 12-16 ) .
It has been suggested that GSH deficiency in T cells would be involved in the patho-genesis of AIDS ( 4 , 6 ) and common variable immunodeficiency ( 17 ) , and , therefore , that NAC may improve T cell functions in these conditions .

During a primary immune response , the activation of T cells depends on their interactions with dendritic cells ( DC ) , a highly specialized population of APC that express constitutively NF- « B ( 18-24 ) .
DC have the unique ability to stimulate naive T cells through the expression on their membrane of high levels of MHC class II molecules , which are critical for Ag presentation to Th cells as well as costimulatory molecules ( i.e. , B7 molecules ) that deliver accessory signals required for T cell activation ( 18 , 19 ) .
To get further insight into the immune effects of NAC , we determined its effects on human DC , paying particular attention to NF- « B activity , cytokine production , and expression of costimulatory molecules both at the basal state and upon activation induced by either LPS or CD40 engagement ( 25-29 ) .
Finally , we determined the effect of NAC on the ability of DC to elicit a primary alloreactive T cell response .
Materials and Methods Medium and reagents Culture medium for the generation of DC consisted in RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine , 20 ug/tol gentamicin , 50 M 2-ME , 1 % nonessential amino acids ( Life Tech-nologies ) , and 10 % FBS ( Myoclone ; Life Technologies ) .
For all subsequent experiments , culture medium was devoid of 2-ME .
IL-4 was purchased from Genzyme ( Cambridge , MA ) .
Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage ( GM ) -CSF was obtained from Schering-Plough ( Brussels , Belgium ) .
NAC , L-buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) , and LPS from Escherichia coli ( serotype 0128 : B12 ) were obtained from Sigma ( Bornem , Belgium ) .
NAC was dissolved in RPMI 1640 , and pH was adjusted to 7.4 by the addition of NaOH .
Cell preparations DC were generated from PBMC as described by Romani et al .
( 30 ) .
Briefly , PBMC from healthy volunteers were isolated by density centrif-ugation of heparinized blood on Lymphoprep ( Nycomed , Oslo , Norway ) , resuspended in culture medium , and allowed to adhere to 6-well plates .
After 2 h at 37°C , nonadherent cells were removed and adherent cells were 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 2570 cultured in 3 ml of medium containing GM-CSF ( 800 U/ml ) and IL-4 ( 500 U/ml ) .
Every 2 days , 300 pl of medium were removed and replaced by the same volume of fresh medium containing 2400 U of GM-CSF and 1500 U of IL-4 .
After 7 days of culture , DC were harvested , washed , and used for subsequent experiments .
The resulting cell preparation contained > 90 % DC as assessed by morphology and FACS analysis .
T lymphocytes were purified from PBMC using Lympho-Kwik ( One Lambda , Los Angeles , CA ) ; they were > 90 % pure as assessed by FACS .
Naive CD45 * CD4* T cells were purified in two steps using magnetic cell separation columns and Ab mixture ( Miltenyi Biotech , Auburn , CA ) : an initial step of negative selection of CD4* T cells was followed by a second step of negative selection of CDASRA * cells .
CDASRA * CD4 * T cells were > 95 % pure as assessed by FACS analysis .
DC cultures A total of 5 X 10° DC were cultured during 24 h in a 24-well plate in 1 ml of medium with or without NAC .
To test the role of GSH in the effects of NAC , 1 mM BSO was added 1 h prior the addition of NAC .
For experiments assessing the effects of NAC on DC maturation , DC were incubated during 24 h in medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml LPS or during 72 h in the presence of mouse fibroblasts transfected with the human CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) gene ( a kind gift from Dr. Kris Thielemans , Vrije Universiteit Brussel , Belgium ) together with NAC .
After the incubation period , cells were harvested for phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry and supernatants were harvested for determination of cytokine levels by ELISA .
T cell stimulation A total of 2 X 10° purified T cells or naive CD4SRA * CD4* T cells were stimulated in a 96-well plate either by 7 X 10° allogenic irradiated DC ( DC : T ratio of 1:30 ) or by coated OKT3 mAb ( 5 ug/ml ) ( Ortho Biotech , Raritan , NJ ) plus anti-CD28 mAb ( 1 pg/ml ; Immunotech , Marseille , France ) in the presence or the absence of NAC .
To compare the effects of NAC on APC-dependent vs APC-independent stimulation of purified T cells in the first experiments using purified T cells , we tested increasing doses of NAC in stimulation experiments conducted during 3 days .
We then assessed the effects of optimal concentration of NAC on primary MLR using naive T cells during various incubation periods .
After the incubation period , supernatants were harvested for determination of cytokine levels and [ °H ] thymidine was added during 8 h to assess cell proliferation .
Cytokine assays IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF- « , and IL-12 ( p40 ) were measured by ELISA kits from Biosource Europe ( Fleurus , Belgium ) .
IFN-y and IL-5 were measured using ELISA kits from Chromogenix ( Mélndal , Sweden ) and PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) , respectively .
Immunophenotyping of DC Cells were washed in PBS supplemented with 1 % BSA , 0.1 % NaN , 10 % pooled human serum , and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with one of the following mAbs : phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated anti-HLA-DR IgG2a mAb ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) , PE-conjugated anti-CD80 IgG1 mAb ( B7-1 ; Becton Dickinson ) , PE-conjugated anti-CD86 ( B7-2 ) IgGZb mAb ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) , FITC-conjugated anti-CD40 IgG1 mAb ( Biosource International , Camarillo , CA ) , or corresponding iso-type-matched control mAbs .
Cell fluorescence was then analyzed using a FACScan flow-cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Apoptosis detection A total of 2 X 10° cells were incubated with 5 pl annexin V-FITC in binding buffer ( Bender MedSystems , Vienna , Austria ) during 10 min , then washed and resuspended in binding buffer before the addition of 5 pg/ml propidium iodide ( P1 ) .
Cells in early apoptosis ( annexin V-positive cells ) , cells in late apoptosis ( annexin V-positive and Pl-positive ) , and necrotic cells ( Pl-positive cells ) were then quantified by FACS .
Mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis evaluation DC were washed in LPS-free PBS and resuspended in medium buffered with 25 mM of HEPES and containing 0.5 pg/ml FITC-Dextran ( Molecular Probe , Eugene , OR ) .
After 15 min of incubation at 37°C or 0°C ( as negative control ) , cells were washed four times with cold PBS prior FACS analysis .
Cellular GSH assay A total of 10° DC were washed in PBS and sonicated .
Proteins were then precipitated with 200 pl metaphosphoric acid 5 % and centrifuged at 10,000 INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF N-ACETYL-L-CYSTEINE ON HUMAN DC rpm for 2 min .
Total GSH was measured in the supernatant by reduction with DTT , derivatization with monobrobimane , and separation by HPLC ( adapted from Ref .
31 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay DC were incubated during 2 h in the different conditions tested ( medium alone , 25 mM NAC , 10 ng/ml LPS , or LPS plus NAC ) .
Cells were then harvested and washed twice in cold PBS .
Total cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in Totex buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 350 mM NaCl , 20 % glycerol , 1 % NP40 , 1 mM MgCI2 , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 2 mM Pefabloc , 5 mM DTT , and 0.15 IU Aprotinin ) during 15 min on ice .
After centrifugation , the supernatant was collected and stored at -70°C .
NF-KB binding activity of the protein extract was tested using an oligonucleotide from the murine Igx enhancer that had the following se-quence : 5'-AGC TAG AGG GGA CTT TCC GAG AGG-3 ' and was end-labeled with [ a-*P ] ATP by using Klenow enzyme ( Boerhinger Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) .
For the binding reaction , 30 ug of the extract were added to a reaction mixture containing 2 ug poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia , San Diego , CA ) , 20 ug BSA , 4 % Ficoll 400 , 20 mM HEPES , 60 mM KCI ] , 2 mM DTT , and 10,000 cpm of [ °°P ] -labeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 20 pl and were incubated at room temperature for 15 min .
The free and protein-bound oligonucleotides were separated by electrophoresis on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel in a 0.5 % Tris-borate EDTA buffer .
After electrophoresis , the gel was dried and exposed to a PhophorImager screen ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Statistical analysis Data were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon 's paired test .
Results NAC inhibits constitutive and LPS-induced activation of NF- « B in human DC As DC express constitutively the transcription factor NF-KB , which regulates the expression of many genes encoding immune and inflammatory proteins , we first evaluated the effect of NAC on NF- « B activity in DC both at the basal state and upon stimulation by LPS .
The concentration of NAC ( 25 mM ) used in this first series of experiments was chosen according to previous studies on other cell types ( 1 , 5 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , we observed that DC treatment with LPS clearly increased the activity of NF- « B and that NAC inhibited the constitutive as well as the LPS-induced NF-KB activity .
Specificity of NF- « B complex was established using excess unlabeled NF- « B probe , which competed successfully for NF- « B binding , while a nonspecific competitor ( AP-1 probe ) did not .
NAC down-regulates the constitutive expression of HLA-DR , CD86 ( B7-2 ) , and CD40 by human DC To determine whether the inhibitory action of NAC on NF- « B activity was paralleled by modifications of the phenotype of DC , we tested the effects of NAC on the expression of surface molecules involved in the APC function of DC .
As shown in Fig .
2 , NAC clearly inhibited the expression of HLA-DR , B7-2 ( CD86 ) , and CD40 , while leaving the expression of B7-1 ( CD80 ) un-changed .
These effects of NAC were observed in presence as well as in absence of IL-4 and GM-CSF ( data not shown ) .
NAC inhibits DC responses to LPS or CD40 ligation As DC maturation is an essential process during which DC acquire optimal immunostimulatory properties , we examined the influence of NAC on DC responses to LPS or CD40 ligation , which are major stimuli for DC maturation ( 25-29 ) .
As shown in Table I , the enhanced secretion of IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , and TNF-a induced by LPS was inhibited by NAC in a dose-dependent manner ; a maximal effect was achieved at a concentration of 25 mM .
NAC also inhibited CD4O0L-induced cytokine secretion , although less effi-ciently .
As shown in Fig .

The induction by LPS of CD83 , an established marker of DC maturation ( 32 , 33 ) , was also prevented by NAC .
NAC does not affect DC viability To exclude a cytopathic effect of NAC on DC , we first evaluated DC viability using PI and annexin V staining .
As shown in Table II , treatment of DC with NAC did not modify the percentages of apoptotic and/or necrotic cells .
Furthermore , we found that NAC did not interfere with the ability of DC to internalize FITC-dextran ( Fig .
3 ) , indicating preservation of their ability of mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis , which is an active metabolic process of immature DC ( 25 ) .
In addition , NAC prevented the down-regulation of this process induced by LPS ( Fig .
3 ) .
The effects of NAC on DC are not dependent of an increase in GSH cell content As NAC can act both through its scavenging properties of ROI and as a precursor for GSH synthesis , we evaluated the effects of NAC in the presence of BSO , an agent that prevents neosynthesis of GSH by inhibiting the y-glutamylcysteine synthetase ( 34 ) .
As shown in Table III , the inhibitory effects of NAC on the constitutive expression of B7-2 and CD40 were not affected by the presence of BSO at a concentration preventing the increase in GSH content induced by NAC .
Similarly , BSO did not affect the inhibition of LPS responses by NAC ( data not shown ) .

Levels of IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , and TNF-a in supernatants were determined by ELISA .
Basal levels of IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , and TNF- @ were 0.5 + 0.4 , 1.3 + 0.8 , 0.3 + 0.1 , and 0.2 + 0.1 ng/ml , respectively .
Data represent the mean + SEM of three independent experiments for LPS stimulation and four experiments for CD4OL stimulation .
refractory to maturating stimuli , we compared the effects of NAC on T cell responses induced either by allogeneic DC or by a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs , the latter activation system being APC-independent .
As shown in Fig .
4 , the addition of increasing doses of NAC to MLR between purified T cells and irradiated allogeneic DC inhibited the proliferative response as well as the production of IFN-y and IL-5 in a dose-dependent manner .
These effects were observed in six independent experiments ( p < 0.05 beyond 1.5 mM NAC for proliferation and IFN-y production and beyond 3 mM NAC for IL-5 production ) .
In con-trast , T cell responses to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs were either increased ( p < 0.05 for IFN-y production when NAC is added at concentrations ranging from 1.5-12 mM ) or not modified by the addition of NAC ( Fig .
4 ) .
To further document the action of NAC on primary T cell responses , the MLR experiments were repeated using purified naive CD45RA * CD4 * T cells as responder cells .
At the optimal concentration of NAC ( 12 mM ) , we observed that NAC profoundly inhibited the T cell proliferative response at serial time points ( Fig .
5 ) as well as the secretion of cytokines ( data not shown ) .
Discussion In the present study , we first observed that NAC inhibits the basal NF- « B activity in DC and in parallel down-regulates the expression of surface molecules known to be critical for their APC function .
These molecules include HLA-DR involved in the presentation of antigenic peptides to CD4 * T cells , B7-2 , a costimulatory molecule acting as a ligand for CD28 expressed at the T cell membrane ( 35 ) , and CD40 , which transduces activation signals required for the up-regulation of B7 molecules and the induction of IL-12 synthesis by DC in the early phase of the immune response ( 36 , 37 ) .
Our data confirm previous observations showing that DC express constitutively NF- « B ( 20-24 ) and suggest that NF- « B activity is required directly or indirectly for the regulation of the expression of genes that are critical for their function .

The inhibitory effects of NAC on NF-KB activity have been attributed in other cell types to its direct scavenging properties of ROI and/or to its ability to alter the redox potential of the cell to a more reduced one , either directly by the presence of a thiol group or indirectly by increasing the synthesis of GSH ( 7-11 ) .
In this study , it appears that the inhibitory effects of NAC on DC are not due to a de novo synthesis of GSH as they were maintained in the presence of BSO , an inhibitor of GSH synthesis .
Accordingly , previous data have demonstrated similar GSH-independent inhibitory effects of NAC on TNF production by Kupffer cells ( 38 ) , as well as on HIV transcription and replication in T cells ( 4 , 39 ) .
Maturation of DC is a critical process as only mature DC are able to induce optimal activation of naive T cells .

process , DC lose their ability to capture and process Ags , increase their expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules , and up-regulate their production of cytokines ( 25-29 ) .
In addition , maturation is closely associated with surface expression of CD83 , the function of which is still unknown ( 32 , 33 ) .
In vivo , schemat-ically , maturation of DC is initiated in nonlymphoid tissues upon exposure to inflammatory molecules such as LPS and is achieved in lymph nodes upon CD40 engagement by CD4OL-expressing T cells .
NAC was found to strongly inhibit DC maturation as reflected by its inhibitory effects on cytokine synthesis , MHC class II , B7-2 , and CD40 up-regulation , induction of CD83 expression , and down-regulation of mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis induced by LPS .
Moreover , we observed that LPS-induced maturation of DC was associated with increased activity of NF-KB and that NAC also inhibited this effect of LPS on DC .
Finally , NAC did also inhibit the effects of CD40 engagement on the stimulation of cytokine production and costimulatory molecule expression ( data not shown ) .

The suppressive effect of NAC was especially pronounced when naive CD4SRA * CD4 * T cells were used as responder cells .
This is consistent with the fact that the activation of naive T cells is strongly dependent on costimulatory signals delivered by DC ( 18 , 19 , 40 , 41 ) .
Interestingly , Peterson et al .
( 42 ) recently showed that GSH depletion of murine spleen cells inhibits their ability to elicit Th1-type responses while favoring Th2-type responses .
It is possible that the effects of GSH depletion in this model are due to its action on other APC than DC .
Moreover , GSH depletion should not be considered as a mirror of NAC treatment as certain effects of NAC do not involve GSH replenishment .
Indeed , as already mentioned , the deactivating effects of NAC in DC , but also in other systems ( 4 , 38 , 39 ) , were found to be independent of an increase in intracellular GSH .
Our data corroborate previous observations made by Chaudhri et al .
( 43 ) indicating that different types of antioxidants inhibited primary alloantigen-induced T cell responses , although the influence of these compounds at the DC level was not considered in this mouse model .
Previous studies have clearly established that T cell hyporespon-siveness observed in various conditions including AIDS ( 4 , 6 ) , common variable immunodeficiency ( 17 ) , and ageing ( 44 ) are related to a decrease in T cell GSH content , leading to propose GSH supplementation using NAC to enhance immune functions in these disorders .
Our observation that NAC inhibits primary human T cell responses elicited by DC indicates that this drug should be considered as a double-edged sword when administered to immuno-deficient patients .
On the other hand , we suggest that the immu-nosuppressive effects of NAC at the DC level might be exploited to prevent pathogenic immune responses such as allograft rejection .
