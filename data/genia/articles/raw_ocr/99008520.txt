Arnob Banerjee* and Paul Rothman** The mechanism by which early lymphoid cells are selectively transformed by v-Abl is currently unknown .
Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling pathways , as measured by activation of Janus protein kinase ( JAK ) 1 , JAK3 , STATS , and STAT6 , in pre-B cells transformed by v-Abl .
To determine whether activation of these cytokine signaling pathways by v-Abl is important in the cellular events induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus , the effects of IL-4 and IL-7 on pre-B cells transformed with a temperature-sensitive v-Abl mutant were examined .
Whereas IL-4 had little or no effect , IL-7 delayed both the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that occur upon v-Abl kinase inactivation .
IL-7 also delayed the decreases in the levels of c-Mye , Bel-2 , and Bcl-x , that occur upon loss of v-Abl kinase activity .
IL-7 did not maintain v-Abl-mediated differentiation arrest of the pre-B cells , as activation of NF-xB and RAG gene transcription was unaffected by IL-7 .
These results identify a potential role for IL-7 signaling pathways in transformation by v-Abl while demonstrating that a combination of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling can not substitute for an active v-Abl kinase in transformed pre-B cells .
4617. ctivated forms of the c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase , A such as v-Abl and BCR-Abl , have been shown to spe- cifically transform hemopoietic cells .
The principal targets of the Abelson murine leukemia virus ( A-MuLV ) , which encodes the v-Abl tyrosine kinase , are lymphoid precursors ( 1 ) .
Characterization of the function of v-Abl in pre-B cells has used a virus encoding a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Abl ( ts-A-MuLV ) ; this virus possesses kinase ( transforming ) activity at a permissive temperature ( 34°C ) but is kinase inactive at a nonpermissive temperature ( 39°C ) .
Studies using ts-A-MuLV-transformed cell lines revealed that upon shift to a nonpermissive temperature , the pre-B cells begin to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ( 2 , 3 ) .
It is unclear which signaling pathway or combination of pathways support survival and proliferation in these cells , as v-Abl activates multiple signaling molecules , including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , c-Myc , protein kinase C , c-Fes , and Ras/ mitogen-activated protein kinase ( 4-8 ) .
Interestingly , differentiation arrest of the transformed cells at the pre-B stage is also lost at a nonpermissive temperature .
Evidence of differentiation in previous studies included increases in the transcription of RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes and the detection of germline x transcripts along with rearrangement of the Ig « locus ( 9 ) .
These studies suggest that the regulation of apoptosis , cell cycle progression , and/or differ *Integrated Program in Cellular , Molecular , and Biophysical Studies and *Depart-ments of Medicine and Microbiology , College of Physicians and Surgeons , Columbia University , New York , NY 10032 Received for publication March 23 , 1998 .

Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 4611- entiation arrest by v-Abl may be required for transformation by A-MuLV .
Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that Janus protein kinases ( JAKs ) and STATs , specifically JAK1 , JAK3 , STAT5 , and STAT6 are activated constitutively in A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cell lines ( 10 ) .
Activation of these molecules in pre-B cells is characteristic of IL-4 ( STAT6 ) and IL-7 ( STATS5 ) stimulation .
Since then , several groups have observed constitutive STAT activation in BCR-Abl transformed cells ( 11-13 ) .
Activation of JAK-STAT pathways has been studied extensively and found to be a critical element of cytokine signal transduction .
The observation that JAKs and STATs are activated by oncogenic forms of c-Abl is interesting because it suggests the involvement of cytokine-stimulated survival and proliferation pathways in the process of lymphoid transformation .
Although activation of cytokine signaling molecules in v-Abl- and BCR-Abl-transformed cells has been established , it remains unclear whether these cytokine pathways are important for transformation by Abl and , if so , which Abl-induced effects they mediate .
Although IL-4 has been shown to have antiapoptotic activity and promote proliferation in B cells and T cells ( 14 ) , it has not yet been implicated in hemopoietic malignancy .
In contrast , two studies have found that overexpression of IL-7 may play a role in transformation .
In one of these studies , transgenic mice were generated in which IL-7 was expressed under control of the Ig heavy chain promoter and enhancer .
These mice had dermal lymphoid infiltrates composed of T lineage cells and also developed B and T cell lymphomas within the first four months of life ( 15 ) .
In the second study , transgenic mice were generated in which IL-7 expression was under the MHC class II promoter .
These transgenics had a high incidence of lymphoid tumors by 4 to 6 mo of age ( 16 ) .
In addition to these transgenic studies , the role of autocrine IL-7 signaling in the transformation of pre-B cells has been examined by two groups .
One of these studies demonstrated that although expression of IL-7 could promote transformation of pre-B cells , there were other events that were also required for pre-B cell transformation ( 17 ) .
Another study found that although v-Abl transformation of a pre-B cell line sometimes resulted in autocrine IL-7 production , overexpression of IL-7 in the same cell line was not 0022-1767/98/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 4612 sufficient for transformation ( 18 ) .
Thus , these studies suggest that although dysregulated IL-7 signaling is not sufficient for pre-B cell transformation , it may contribute to this process .
However , it is not known how constitutive IL-7 signaling contributes to transformation .
The activation of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling molecules in A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells suggests that perhaps signaling through a combination of these cytokine pathways could replace v-Abl kinase activity in transformed pre-B cells .
To examine this possibility , we used a ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cell line to determine whether IL-4 and IL-7 signaling could compensate for the loss of v-Abl kinase activity .
These studies reveal that IL-7 but not IL-4 can reduce the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that result from v-Abl kinase inactivation in these cells .
Additionally , both v-Abl and IL-7 were found to regulate levels of c-Myc , Bel-2 , and Bcl-x , .
IL-7 does not alter the activation of NF-KB or the induction of RAG-1 and RAG-2 gene expression at a nonpermissive temperature .
These findings demonstrate that reconstitution of v-Abl-stimulated JAK-STAT activation in A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells by IL-4 and IL-7 is not sufficient to maintain the cells upon v-Abl inactivation , although IL-7 can transiently promote cell survival and proliferation .
Materials and Methods Cell culture and cytokines The 103 ( ts-A-MuLV transformed pre-B cells ) and 103/be/-2-4 cells ( 103 cells expressing human be/-2 ) ( 9 ) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated FCS and 50 uM B-mercaptocthanol .

IL-7 RECONSTITUTES v-AbIl-MEDIATED SIGNALING Cell cycle analysis Cell cycle analysis was performed using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ( Br-dUrd ) kit I ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
After the addition of BrdUrd ( 5 mg/m ! )
to cell culture media for the final 30 min of culture , cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in 70 % ethanol ( in 50 mM glycine ( pH 2.0 ) ) for 24 h at -20°C .
The samples were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in 100 pl of anti-BrdUrd solution at 37°C for 1 h. Samples were subsequently washed twice with PBS and incubated in 100 ul of anti-mouse Ig-fluorescein solution at 37°C for 30 min in the dark .
Next , the cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200 pl of PBS containing 50 pg/ml PI .
Cells were analyzed by FACS .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) DNA binding reactions were performed as described previously ( 19 ) in 10-pl reaction volumes containing 40 mM KCI , 1 mM MgCl , , 0.1 mM EGTA , 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 4 % Ficoll , 1.2 mg/ml BSA , 200 mg/ml dI-dC , 10 ug of extract , and 1 ng of probe .

Results IL-7 delays apoptosis induced after the loss of v-Abl kinase activity Experiments with the 103 cell line , a ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cell line , have shown that the cells undergo apoptosis upon loss of v-Abl kinase activity ; complete cell death is seen by 4 days ( 9 ) .
To determine whether culture with IL-4 , IL-7 , or a combination of these two cytokines could prevent apoptosis resulting from v-Abl inactivation , 103 cells cultured with or without cytokines were incubated at a nonpermissive temperature .
Cells were harvested after 16 , 24 , and 36 h , and the number of apoptotic cells was determined by either PI ( a marker of DNA content ) staining or trypan blue exclusion .
PI staining was used to identify apoptotic cells in which DNA degradation had begun , leaving the cells with less than one diploid unit of DNA ( where one diploid unit is defined as the amount of DNA in cells in G , phase of the cell cycle ) .
Cells cultured with IL-7 for 16 h at a nonpermissive temperature had a significant reduction in cells undergoing apoptosis when compared with cells cultured without IL-7 ( Fig .
14 ) .
These results were verified by trypan blue exclusion assays ( Fig .
1B ) .
In cells cultured with IL-7 , the percentage of viable cells was 35.0 % and 15.5 % at the 24-h and 36-h timepoints , respectively .
In contrast , in cells cultured without IL-7 , the percentage of viable cells was 18.7 % and 3.7 % at the 24-h and 36-h timepoints , respectively .
Addition of IL-4 to the culture had no effect on cell viability at a nonpermissive temperature .
These results indicate that IL-7 decreases the percentage of apoptotic cells in ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells in which v-Abl has been inactivated and suggest that v-Abl and IL-7 may activate some common survival signals in these cells .
v-Abl kinase activity and IL-7 both regulate bel-2 and bel-x , IL-7 and v-Abl have both been linked to the regulation of be/-2 family members .
be/-2 was the first identified member of a family of proteins that regulate cell survival .
Other family members include bax , which promotes apoptosis , and bel-x , which has two splice variants , Bcl-x , and Bcl-x , ( 20 ) .
Of these two forms , Bel-x ; , like Bcel-2 , has antiapoptotic activity , whereas Bel-xg has apoptotic properties .
Previous studies have shown that cells transformed by BCR-Abl express Bel-2 ; in addition , such cells revert to growth factor-dependence and lose tumorigenic potential upon suppression of Bel-2 expression ( 21 ) .
Recently , Bcel-x , , up-regula-tion by v-Abl was demonstrated in a pre-mast cell line ( 22 ) .
To determine whether v-Abl can regulate levels of Bel-2 in pre-B cells , 103 cells were shifted to a nonpermissive temperature and 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology A s % Cells in SubG1 34°C Population 4 SubG so-604 a03 16.2 +/- 1.3 203 7 £0 P OP C 100 200 300 39°c 3 Subs 807 5 604 4 1 [ , $ 63.3 +/- 7.9 407 Fi zo-IPJ MM i w ESUKS 8 30:1 y .

A , Total RNA was isolated from 103 cells cultured with or without IL-7 at the indicated time intervals following shift to a nonpermissive temperature and subjected to Northern blot analysis .
The blot was probed for murine Bcl-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) expression as indicated .

Blots were incubated with antisera to Bcl-2 , Bcl-x , Bax , and B-actin as indicated .
2A , lanes 1-3 ) .
Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts from these cells demonstrated that Bel-2 protein levels declined after cells were cultured at nonpermissive temperature for 6 h ( Fig .
2B , lanes 1-4 ) .
These data show that Bcel-2 levels are regulated by v-Abl in A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells .
To determine whether the ability of IL-7 to delay apoptosis in 103 cells at a nonpermissive temperature could involve be/-2 regulation , each culture condition in the above experiments was repeated in the presence of IL-7 ( Fig .
24 , lanes 4-5 and Fig .
2B , lanes 5-7 ) .
Culturing cells with IL-7 increased the levels of be/-2 transcripts detected in these cells at the 2-h timepoint .
However , be/-2 transcripts were still not detectable in cells cultured at 39°C for 6 h. Bel-2 protein levels remained at detectable levels for a longer period at a nonpermissive temperature when cells were treated with IL-7 ; levels fell off between 6 and 12 h. These data demonstrate that IL-7 can stabilize bei-2 expression levels in v-Abl-transformed pre-B cells .
To determine whether v-Abl or IL-7 could affect the levels of other be ! -2 family members , levels of Bcl-x and Bax were also examined by Western blot analysis ( Fig .
2B ) .
Whereas Bcl-x4 expression was not observed in these cells ( data not shown ) , Bel-x ; , appeared to be regulated by both v-Abl and IL-7 .
Bcl-x , protein levels declined after 6 h of culture at a nonpermissive temperature , and this decline was prevented by the addition of IL-7 to the culture .
Decreases in Bcl-x , , levels appeared to occur later than decreases in Bcl-2 , both in the presence and absence of IL-7 .
The levels of Bax , a proapoptotic member of this family of proteins , did not change either with the loss of v-Abl kinase activity or with the addition of IL-7 to the cell cultures .
The above results suggest that the suppression of apoptosis by both v-Abl and IL-7 may be at least in part due to regulation of bei-2 or be/-x , .

of v-Abl inactivation ( 2 ) .
It is possible that in addition to decreasing apoptosis , IL-7 could also delay or prevent cell cycle arrest in these cells .
To address this possibility , the distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle was examined in ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells cultured at a nonpermissive temperature in the presence or absence of IL-7 .
The 103 cells were cultured with or without IL-7 and shifted to a nonpermissive temperature for 6 , 12 , or 18 h. BrdUrd ( a marker of DNA synthesis for labeling cells in S phase ) was added to the cultures for the final 30 min of in-cubation .
Cells were then harvested , stained with PI- and fluores-cein-conjugated anti-BrdUrd Ab , and analyzed by FACS to determine the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle .
An analysis of these FACS data demonstrates a progressive reduction in S-phase cells and an accumulation of cells in G , phase ( one diploid unit of DNA by PI staining , BrdUrd-negative ) in cells cultured at a nonpermissive temperature ( Fig .
3 and Table I ) .
Adding IL-7 to the cultures decreased the reduction in S-phase cells and the accumulation of cells in G , phase induced by temperature shift ( Fig .
3 and Table I ) .
IL-4 had no effect on the time-course of G ; arrest of these cells at a nonpermissive temperature ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that IL-7 can decrease the cell cycle arrest induced by v-Abl inactivation in transformed pre-B cells .
IL-7 delays loss of c-Myc transcript levels on v-Abl inactivation One gene that may be mediating the proliferative signaling induced by A-MuLV in pre-B cell lines is c-myc .

tooncogene that has been implicated in apoptosis , the regulation of cell cycle progression , and cellular differentiation ( 23 ) .
Transcription of c-myc is activated by multiple tyrosine kinases , and induction of c-Myc levels by v-Abl is thought to be required for A-MuLV-mediated transformation ( 24 ) .
Upon the shift of ts-A-MuLV transformed myeloid cells to a nonpermissive temperature , c-myc transcript levels have been shown to fall to undetectable levels ( 5 ) .
To determine whether IL-7 could affect the decreased expression of c-myc induced by v-Abl inactivation , ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells were cultured at a nonpermissive temperature for 20 h in the presence or absence of IL-7 , and total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot .
In cells cultured without IL-7 , c-myc transcript levels are greatly decreased after 2 h at 39°C and are undetectable after 8 h. In contrast , when IL-7 is added to these cultures , c-myc transcript levels remain high even after 20 h at nonpermissive temperature ( Fig .
4 ) .
These studies demonstrate that IL-7 can maintain c-Myc mRNA levels in transformed pre-B cells after loss of v-Abl activity .
Activation of NF- « B and RAG genes at a nonpermissive temperature is not affected by IL-7 Pre-B cells transformed by v-Abl remain in the pre-B stage of development and do not rearrange their Ig light chain loci ( 25 ) .
v-Abl-induced differentiation arrest has been studied in the 103/ bei-2-4 cell line , which was derived by stable transfection of 103 cells with human be/-2 to enhance survival time at a nonpermissive temperature .
These studies have demonstrated that the shift of 103/ bel-2-4 cells to a nonpermissive temperature leads to NF- « B ac-tivation , to increased levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 transcripts , and to germline transcription ( 9 , 26 ) .
In addition , these cells have been shown to rearrange the Ig « locus .

These experiments show that IL-7 did not alter the activation of NF- « B or the induction of RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes mediated by the inactivation of v-Abl kinase .
Stat5 activation in response to IL-7 is maintained at least 24 h after v-Abl inactivation The ability of IL-7 and IL-4 to activate STATS and STAT6 , re-spectively , in 103/be/-2-4 cells has been demonstrated previously ( 10 ) .
The transient nature of the IL-7-mediated effects shown in the above experiments could be explained by a loss of responsiveness to IL-7 over time .
To address this possibility , we examined the duration of IL-7-stimulated STATS activation in these cultures .
The 103/bei-2-4 cells were cultured at a nonpermissive temperature in the presence or absence of IL-7 , and extracts from these cells were examined for STATS5 activation by EMSA ( Fig .
6 ) .
After 6 h of culture at a nonpermissive temperature , activation of STATS was no longer detectable in samples cultured without IL-7 .
In contrast , STATS activation remained undiminished for at least 24 h in samples cultured at a nonpermissive temperature in the presence of IL-7 .
Similarly , STAT6 activation in response to IL-4 in 103/bei-2-4 cells remained undiminished for at least 24 h at a nonpermissive temperature ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that IL-7-mediated activation of STATS and IL-4-mediated activation of STAT6 are maintained for at least 24 h after v-Abl inactivation .
Therefore , there is no observed correlation between IL- Hrs at 39°C : O 1 6 12 1 6 12 24 IL-7 ; > - - - 4+ 40 40 % Staté - » ® Stats - » a 4 a ® FIGURE 6 .

Discussion The studies described above suggest that the activation of IL-7 signaling pathways is involved in the survival and proliferation of pre-B cells transformed by A-MuLV .
Although corroborating previous results indicating that IL-7 signaling is not sufficient for complementation of v-Abl signaling ( 17 , 18 ) , the results go beyond these earlier studies , adding insights into the aspects of v-Abl-mediated transformation in which IL-7 may participate .
The observation of constitutive STAT6 activation in A-MuLV transformed pre-B cells suggested a role for IL-4 as well .
Although IL-4 can induce long-term ( > 24 h ) activation of STAT6 in the ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cell line used , the above experiments have shown no function of IL-4 in the survival , proliferation , or differentiation of these cells .
The complete lack of effect of IL-4 in our studies is somewhat surprising , considering IL-4 and IL-7 activate several of the same signaling molecules , including JAK 1 , JAK3 , insulin receptor substrate-1 , insulin receptor substrate-2 , and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 27-29 ) .
The different activities of the two cytokines in our system suggest that the observed effects of IL-7 depend upon a signal that is not delivered by IL-4 , such as STATS activation .
In support of such a possibility , a recent study by Zamorano et al .
has shown that a truncated IL-2R B-chain can support survival in response to IL-2 in 32D cells when it contains a STATS activation site but not when it contains a STAT6 activation site ( 30 ) .
One difference observed between the cellular events induced by IL-7 and those induced by v-Abl is seen in the duration of activation .
Although v-Abl induces a high level expression of be/-2 , bel-x ; , and c-myc indefinitely , the induction of these genes by IL-7 declines in < 24 h. This kinetic difference correlates with the duration of cell survival and proliferation mediated by v-Abl and IL-7 , respectively .
It is possible that a signal activated by v-Abl but not by IL-7 is necessary for continued stimulation of signaling pathways downstream from the IL-7R .
Another possibility is that ligand-dependent signaling through the IL-7R complex activates negative regulatory mechanisms , such as the recruitment of phos-phatases , suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins ( 31-33 ) , or receptor modulation , which are not activated by the initiation of IL-7 signaling by v-Abl .
The activation of STATS in response to IL-7 at a nonpermissive temperature remains high at timepoints when cell survival and proliferation have already begun to decline , indicating that STATS activation is not sufficient for the observed effects of IL-7 on cell survival and cell cycle progression .
It is of interest that as B cell precursors mature , expression of the IL-7R is lost ( 34 ) , suggesting that differentiation and a loss of responsiveness to IL-7 in ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells may be linked events .
The arrest of cellular differentiation is a common feature of transformed cells and is thought to be an important component of oncogenesis .
In the cells used in our studies , v-Abl arrests differentiation at the pre-B cell stage .
Differentiation in the B cell lineage can be followed by analysis of surface molecule expression and rearrangement status of the Ig locus ( 35 ) .
Prior studies have suggested that IL-7 can decrease levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 in pre-B cells ( 36 ) .
In contrast , other studies have supported a role for IL-7 signaling in the induction of Ig rearrangement ( 37 ) .
In our studies , IL-7 had no effect on the induction of RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes upon v-Abl inactivation .
In addition to altering RAG-1 and RAG-2 gene expression , v-Abl activity is associated with inactivation of the intronic enhancer .
The repression of the intronic 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 4616 enhancer in v-Abl-transformed pre-B cells has been shown to be due to stabilization of IB in these cells , resulting in an inhibition of NF- « B/rel activity ( 26 ) .
In our experiments , IL-7 failed to maintain NF- « B/rel inhibition upon v-Abl inactivation .
These results suggest that although can arrest differentiation in pre-B cells , IL-7 is not sufficient to prevent differentiation from the pre-B cell stage .
In contrast to the lack of effect of IL-7 on the induction of differentiation , loss of be/-2 and bei-x , expression upon v-Abl kinase inactivation was delayed by IL-7 .
The regulation of bei-2 family members by v-Abl has also recently been observed in a pre-mast cell line ( 22 ) and is interesting in light of the prior observation that be/-2 is essential for BCR-Abl-mediated transformation ( 21 ) .
Regulation of Bel-2 levels by IL-7 has been demonstrated previously in several cell types , including pro-B cells , NK cells , T cell progenitors , and mature T cells ( 38-43 ) .
In the T cell lineage , the regulation of Bel-2 levels by IL-7 is essential for normal T cell development .
Although the above data show a correlation between cell survival and levels of Bel-2 and Bcl-x , , whether bei-2 family members are required for transformation by v-Abl remains to be established .
Overexpression of human be/-2 in the ts- A-MuLV-transformed cell line 103 has been shown previously to delay apoptosis secondary to loss of v-Abl activity ( 9 ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that upon v-Abl inactivation in ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells , the observed delay in apoptosis in cells cultured with IL-7 is , at least in part , mediated by IL-7-stimulated regulation of either bei/-2 , be/-x , , or a combination of these molecules .
Previous studies by Merino et al .
determined the 1 , , , of Bel-2 within a B cell line to be ~10 h ; in our experiments , the , , , of Bel-2 was closer to 6 h ( 44 ) .
Whereas the measurements of Merino et al .
were made in the absence of any apoptotic stimuli , our system included an apoptotic stimulus , namely v-Abl inactivation .
These results provide evidence for active degradation of Bel-2 in cells subjected to certain apoptotic stimuli .
One potential mechanism for this degradation has been revealed in recent work showing cleavage of Bel-2 by activated caspases in cells undergoing apoptosis ( 45 ) .
Although the overexpression of antiapoptotic molecules such as Bel-2 and Bcl-x , may promote oncogenesis , additional signals appear to be required for cellular transformation .
One oncogene that can cooperate with be/-2 for transformation is c-myc .
Overexpression of c-myc and bei-2 has been shown to immortalize pre-B cells ( 46 , 47 ) .
c-myc has also been implicated as an important factor in transformation by oncogenic forms of c-Abl .
v-Abl activates transcription of c-myc in myeloid cells ( 5 ) , and transformation of pre-B cells by both v-Abl and BCR-Abl can be blocked by expression of transdominant negative c-Myc ( 24 ) .
c-myc transcription is also induced by IL-7 in pre-B cells ( 48 ) .
Our results demonstrate that when v-Abl-induced c-myc transcription is inactivated in pre-B cells , IL-7 treatment can maintain levels of c-myc and also delay the loss of proliferative activity of the cells , transiently substituting for v-Abl in these functions .
IL-7 and v-Abl both regulate the cell cycle during G , phase , supporting the possibility that they may use similar signaling pathways in this regulation ( 2 , 49 ) .
Several recent studies have demonstrated the activation of cytokine signaling molecules in different forms of malignancy .
Although the oncogenes BCR-Abl , v-src , and v-ab/ have all been shown to activate STAT molecules in transformed cells ( 10-13 , 50-52 ) , the functional significance of cytokine signaling pathways in oncogenesis is not known .
In this study , we have demonstrated that signaling through IL-7 can reduce the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that ts-A-MuLV-transformed pre-B cells undergo with the loss of v-Abl kinase activity .
