Pierre H. ELIARD and Guy G. ROUSSEAU* International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology and University of Louvain Medical School , 75 avenue Hippocrate , B-1200 Brussels , Belgium ( Received 8 August 1983/Accepted 2 November 1983 ) The thermodynamics of the interaction of glucocorticoids with their receptor were studied in cytosol from human lymphoblastoid cells .
The rate and affinity constants of dexamethasone and cortisol between 0° and 25°C were calculated by curve-fitting from time-course and equilibrium kinetics .
The data were consistent with a simple reversible bimolecular interaction .
Arrhenius and Va n't Hoff plots were curvilinear for both steroids .
At equilibrium , the solution for the equation AG = AH - T-AS ( eqn .
1 ) was ( in kJ -mol ~ ' ) -47 = 36-83 ( dexamethasone ) and -42 = -9- 33 ( cortisol ) at 0°C .
Enthalpy and entropy changes decreased quasi-linearly with temperature such that , at 25°C , the respective values were -50 = -75 +25 and -43 = -48 +5 .
Thus , for both steroids , the interaction was entropy-driven at low temperature and became entirely enthalpy-driven at 20°C .
Thermodynamic values for the transition state were calculated from the rate constants .
For the forward reaction , eqn .
( 1 ) gave 45 = 84-39 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 60-14 ( cortisol ) at 0°C , and 44 = 24 +20 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 28 + 18 ( cortisol ) at 25°C .
These data fit quite well with a two-step model [ Ross & Subramanian ( 1981 ) Biochemistry 20 , 3096-3102 ] proposed for ligand-protein interactions , which involves a partial immobilization of the reacting species governed by hydrophobic forces , followed by stabilization of the complex by short-range interactions .
On the basis of this model , an analysis of the transition-state thermodynamics led to the conclusion that no more than half of the steroid molecular area is engaged in the binding process .
The receptor for glucocorticoid hormones is a DNA-binding protein , which , in the unbound state , is found in the cytosol of target cells ( Rousseau , 1975 ) .
To approach the molecular mechanism of the receptor-steroid binding pro-cess , we have performed a thermodynamic analysis of the cell-free binding of steroids to the cytosolic receptor .
Earlier studies yielded conflicting results ( Koblinsky et al. , 1972 ; Wolff et al. , 1978 ; Jones et al. , 1979 ; Snochowski et al. , 1980 ) , presumably owing to receptor thermolability in cytosol above 0°C and because higher temperatures accelerate ( Higgins et a/. , 1973 ) the so-called transformation of the initial receptor-steroid complex into the DNA-binding conformation , thereby shifting the system away from a simple bimolecular interaction .
Discrepancies could also be accounted for by our more recent finding that cell-free binding kinetics are not reproducible unless the concentration of free Ca++ ions is kept under control ( Rousseau et al. , 1982 ) and protection of * To whom reprint requests should be addressed .

To our knowledge , no information is available about the transition-state thermodynamics of glucocorticoid-receptor interactions , and no thermodynamic study on the human glucocorticoid receptor has been reported so far .
We have used here cytosol from cultured IM-9 cells , an established line of glucocorticoid-sensitive human lymphoblasts which contain steroid receptors for glucocorticoids , but not for other classes of steroid hormones .
The binding studies were performed in the presence of a Ca *-chelating agent ( EDTA ) , of a thiol-protecting agent ( dithio-threitol ) , and of molybdate ions .
Molybdate protects the cytosolic receptor against thermoinactiva-tion ( Nielsen et al. , 1977 ) and blocks its transformation into the DNA-binding state ( Leach et al. , 1979 ) .
This enabled us to determine the transition-state and equilibrium thermodynamics of the binding of dexamethasone ( Iu-fluoro-16 « -methy ] -11 $ ,17,21 - trihydroxypregna - 1,4 - diene - 3,20 dione ) , which is a potent glucocorticoid agonist in 396 this system ( Rousseau et al. , 1980 ) , and of cortisol , the natural glucocorticoid in the human .
Materials and methods Chemicals and buffers [ 1,2,4+H ] Dexamethasone ( 46Ci/mmol ) , [ 1,2-*HJ } cortisol ( 36Ci/mmol ) and gesterone ( 96Ci/mmol ) were obtained from The Radiochemical Centre , Amersham , Bucks. , U.K. [ 17a-methyl- } > H ] Methyltrienolone ( R1881 , 56Ci/mmol ) and [ /7a-methyl- > H ] promegestone ( R5020 , 87Ci/mmol ) were obtained from New England Nuclear Co. , Boston , MA , U.S.A. Radiochemical purity was determined by t.l.c .
with the solvent systems recommended by the supplier .
Samples were evaporated to dryness immediately before use and redissolved at appropriate concentrations in incubation buffers .
Non-labelled steroids were from Merck , Sharp and Dohme , Rahway , NJ , U.S.A. ( dexamethasone ) , or from Steraloids ( Wilton , NH , U.S.A. ) .
Stock solutions at ImM in ethanol were stored at -20°C .
All chemicals were reagent grade from Merck , Darm-stadt , Germany , or from Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO , U.S.A. , unless mentioned otherwise .
Homogenization buffer contained 20mM-Tricine { N - 2 - hydroxy - 1,1 - bis ( hydroxymethyl ) ethy ] ] glycine } ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA , U.S.A. ) , pH7.8 at 0°C , 10mM-Na ; Mo0 , , 1 mM-EDTA and 2 mM-dithiothreitol .
Cytosol preparation and binding studies IM-9 cells were grown and harvested , and the cytosol was prepared as described by Rousseau et al .
( 1980 ) .
The concentration of cytosol protein , determined ( Lowry et al. , 1951 ) with bovine serum albumin as a standard , was adjusted with homogenization buffer to 5 mg/ml .
Cytosol samples were stored at -80°C , a procedure that preserves the receptor for several months .
Binding of steroids to the receptor was determined as described by Rousseau et al .
( 1972 ) .
Incubations were conducted in homogenization buffer in water baths at temperatures controlled within 0.1°C , with cytosol contributing one-quarter of the volume .
To determine bound steroid , 0.4ml samples were removed and agitated for 5s with 0.2m1l of an ice-cold aqueous charcoal suspension containing 25 mg of Norit A/ml and 5mg of dextran ( grade C , from BDH Chemicals , Poole , Dorset , U.K. ) /ml .
The mixture was centrifuged at 2500g for 5min at 4°C .
Radioactivity was determined on 0.25ml of the supernatant by scintillation counting in Picofiuor ( Packard , Downers Grove , IL , U.S.A. ) with an efficiency of 48 % .
Quenching was corrected by the channels-ratio method .
Non-specific binding was determined from incubations , conducted in P. H. Eliard and G. G. Rousseau parallel , which contained in addition 12.5 um non-radioactive steroid or 50 um-HgCl ; , a salt that inactivates the receptor ( Rousseau , 1975 ) .
This value was subtracted from the amount of total bound steroid to yield receptor-bound steroid .
All determinations were done in triplicate .
Calculations All calculations were based on the initial assumption ( Rousseau , 1975 ; Yeakley et al. , 1980 ) that steroid binding to the glucocorticoid receptor in cytosol involves a simple and reversible bimolecular reaction , without interaction between sites such that a S+ R k ‘ RS ( 1 ) where S and R refer to the concentrations of free steroid and free receptor respectively , RS refers to the concentration of receptor-steroid complex , and k , , and k _ ; are the rate constants for association and dissociation .
The equilibrium constant K , is defined by the Law of Mass Action : RS _ k , , 1 a = -- < = -A =- ( 2 ) RS k ; £ » The second-order association kinetics are expressed by dRS ( ? )
dt where all concentrations are a function of time , 1 .
The kinetics of dissociation are first-order : dRS ( t ) df If neither the steroid nor the receptor is being de-graded , their concentrations in eqn .
( 3 ) can be expressed as a function of their respective initial values at zero time ( 1 , ) , S , and R , , such that dRS ( H ) _ dr k , , - [ R , -RS ( @ ] [ S , « RS ( P ) ( 5 ) and RS ( 1t , ) =0 At a time 1 , when equilibrium has been reached , ie .
when dRS ( H ) /dt = 0 , eqn .
( 5 ) can be solved as follows : RS ( ) = 0. : S5l ( 8 ) q + Ro +Kn- V ( 54 + Ro + Kp ) -4 'So Rl ( 6 ) R , and Kp values were calculated from equilibrium saturation curves obtained by incubating a fixed receptor concentration with various concentrations of steroid .
For pilot experiments , the data were plotted by linear regression according to Scatchard ( 1949 ) .
For the thermodynamic studies , = k , , - R ( ) - RS ( ) _ ( 3 ) =-k._ , RS @ ( 4 ) R , and Kp values were determined by curve-fitting of the more precise plot of RS against S , according 1984 Thermodynamics of glucocorticoid-receptor interactions 397 to eqn .
( 6 ) .
Curve-fitting was performed by the least-squares method , by using the non-linear regression program MLAB ( Knott , 1979 ) , on a Tektronix 4051 terminal ( Tektronix , Beaverton , OR , U.S.A. ) linked to a DEC 20 computer ( Digital Equipment Co. , Boston , MA , U.S.A. ) .
For determination of the rate constants & , , and k- , a fixed concentration of receptor was incubated with a fixed concentration of steroid , and receptor-bound steroid was measured at various time points until equilibrium was reached .
When plotting RS as a function of time 1 , both k , , and k_ , could be obtained by non-linear curve-fitting of the differential eqn .
( 5 ) after introducing S , and R , values ( Ketelslegers et al. , 1975 ) .
In some experiments , a 200-fold excess of non-labelled steroid was added to an incubation pre-equili-brated with labelled steroid , after which receptor-bound steroid was measured at various time points .
The value of k_ , could then be determined directly , by using eqn .
( 4 ) , from semi-logarithmic linear plots of the binding data .
Results Stability of the receptor sites under cell-free conditions Since the ApK , of Tricine buffer is -0.021°C - ! , increasing the temperature from 0 to 30°C decreased the pH of incubations by about 0.6 unit .
We sought conditions under which such pH changes in themselves did not influence the binding properties of the receptor .
It was found that the affinity and the binding capacity were constant between pH7.1 and pH8.2 at 0°C .
We therefore chose to adjust the pH at 7.8 at 0°C such that the lowest pH values brought about by increases in temperature ( maximum 30°C ) would not be below 7.2 .
Next we assessed the thermostability of the receptor under our incubation conditions .
Fig .
l ( a ) shows that the receptor was stable for at least 16h between 0° and 20°C , and for at least 7h at 25°C .
At 30°C , however , inactivation approached 50 % by 2h .
Several steroids that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor behave as glucocorticoid antagonists .
Earlier studies have shown that free or antagonist-bound receptor is less stable than agon-ist-bound receptor ( Rousseau et a/. , 1972 ) , thereby suggesting the existence of at least two receptor conformations .
Having found conditions under which the unbound receptor is thermostable ( Fig .
1a ) , we assumed that such conditions would allow a thermodynamic study of the binding of glucocorticoid antagonists .
Cytosol was incubated at increasing temperatures with different concentrations of one of the three antagonists progesterone , methyltrienolone and promegestone .

Influence of the incubation temperature of cytosol on the concentration of unoccupied or occupied receptor ( a ) Unoccupied receptor .
Portions of cytosol were incubated at the seven temperatures indicated .
Samples were removed at the times shown and further incubated for 16h at 0°C with a near-saturat-ing concentration ( 30 nM ) of { *H ] dexamethasone to determine the receptor-binding capacity .
The data are expressed as the ratio of bound receptor to total receptor concentration determined concomitantly at 0°C by Scatchard analysis .
The latter value ( 1.0 on the ordinate ) was 0.8nM , which corresponded to 34700d4.p.m .
per incubation mixture .
( b ) Occupied receptors .
Portions of cytosol were incubated at the indicated temperatures with five concentrations of each agonist ( closed symbols ) or antagonist ( open symbols ) .
After 16h , the total concentration of receptor sites available for binding by each steroid was determined by extrapolation of Scatchard plots .
plots were constructed from the concentrations of specifically bound steroid determined at apparent equilibrium .
At 0°C , the K , , values for the three steroids were 30 , 13 and 7nM respectively .
Unex-pectedly , however , the receptor-site concentration calculated by extrapolation decreased with increasing temperature ( Fig .
16 ) , as if the receptor occupied by the antagonists were less stable than the unoccupied receptor .
This decrease was not due to steroid degradation , as verified by thin-layer radiochromatography of the steroids extracted 398 from the incubations .
In contrast , receptor occupied by either of the two agonists , dexamethasone and cortisol , was stable under those conditions ( Fig .
1b ) .
The Scatchard plots ( not shown ) obtained with these steroids were linear at 0°C , as in earlier work ( Rousseau et al. , 1980 ) , and remained so at all temperatures tested , consistent with the simple model postulated above ( eqn .
1 ) .
On the basis of these results , we had to exclude the antagonists from our thermodynamic study .
Equilibrium thermodynamics At 0°C , the equilibrium dissociation constant for dexamethasone is in the nanomolar range ( the mean Kp value , 4+S.E.M. , was 1.1+0.1nM in 12 experiments ) , i.e .
equilibrium is strongly in favour of the steroid-receptor complex because of the markedly negative value of the Gibbs energy change of the system upon binding AG° = -RT -In ( 1/Kp ) ( 7 ) where R and T are the gas constant and the absolute temperature respectively .

Va n't Hoff plots of the glucocorticoid-receptor interactions Each point on the graph was derived by curve-fitting ( eqn .
6 ) from an equilibrium binding experiment involving triplicate incubations with five different concentrations of steroid ( see the Materials and methods section ) .
K , is expressed in M~ ' .
The lines on the graph , which extend beyond the experimental points , were obtained by fitting a parabola .
P. H. Eliard and G. G. Rousseau Gibbs energy value reflect changes in both the enthalpy ( AH® ) and the entropy ( AS® ) such that AG° = AH*-T-AS®° ( 8 ) To evaluate the relative contributions of AH° and AS to the binding energy , Kp values for dexamethasone and cortisol were determined at five temperatures between 0 and 25°C by non-linear curve-fitting , by using eqn .
( 6 ) .
For both steroids , Kp values varied with temperature , and Va n't Hoff plots were curvilinear ( Fig .
2 ) .
Gibbs energy changes were calculated by using eqn .
( 7 ) , and plots of AG° against temperature also showed curvilinearity with one extremum , indicating a maximum stability of the complex ( dAG*/dt =0 ) at 20-25°C for both steroids ( Fig .
3 ) .
When AH° and AS® are independent of temperature , the Va n't Hoff plot is linear , and these parameters can be determined from the slope and the vertical axis intercept of the plot respectively .
Because our plots were curvilinear , we resorted to the method of Osborne et al .
( 1976 ) , which is to find a parabolic expression of AG° as a function of temperature : AG°= A+B -T+C- T ( 9 ) where A , B , C are constants .
The best fit of the experimental data for the two steroids is shown by the lines in Fig .

Note that AC ] values are obtained from the second derivative of experimental data and are therefore relatively imprecise .
The equilibrium thermodynamic parameters calculated for dexamethasone and cortisol are given in Table 1 .
These data were treated graphically as described by Waelbroeck et al .
( 1979 ) to see how the parameters of eqn .
( 8 ) vary with temperature .
Data for dexamethasone are shown in Fig .
4 ( a ) .
For both steroids , AH® and T-AS® decreased quasi-linearly as temperature increased from 0 to 25°C ; the interaction was entropy-driven ( positive T-AS® ) at low temperatures and became entirely enthalpy-driven ( negative AH® ) between 20 and 25°C ; AC ] was negative .
The interpretation of these data is discussed below .
Transition-state thermodynamics The foregoing data were obtained at equilibrium , and therefore yielded no information about the energy barrier ( AG+ ) that must be overcome during the association or dissociation process .
This information can be derived from a study of the temperature-dependence of the rate constants .
By analogy with the transition-state theory of enzyme kinetics ( Dixon & Webb , 1964 ) , one may assume that an activated complex RS !
of higher energy is in equilibrium with the free ligands and RS such that R+SzRS ! zRS ( 13 ) ( 'activation ' should not be confused with the process by which RS acquires the property to interact with DNA ; the latter process is called here 'trans-formation ' ) .
The free-energy change ( AG+ ) of the transition state can then be expressed as aA6t = am -T- = -RT-Ink+ RT -In ( bT/h ) _- ( 14 ) where k is the experimental rate constant ( forward or reverse ) and b and / are the Boltzmann and the Planck constants , respectively .
The rate constants were calculated from plots of the time-course of binding conducted at different temperatures ( Fig .
5 ) .
Mathematical curve-fitting using eqn .
( 5 ) yielded k , , and k_ , .

Time course of the binding of dexamethasone and cortisol to the glucocorticoid receptor Representative experiments of binding kinetics at different temperatures .
Receptor concentrations ( R , ) were as follows ( in nM ) : dexamethasone , 2.1 ( 0°C ) , 1.3 ( 25°C ) ; cortisol , 1.1 ( 0°C ) , 1.4 ( 10°C ) , 1.3 ( 20°C ) .
Steroid concentrations ( S , ) were as follows ( in nM ) : 29.1 ( 0°C ) , 1.3 ( 25°C ) ; cortisol , 33.2 ( 0°C ) , 13.2 ( 10°C ) , 4.7 ( 20°C ) .
The lines correspond to the computer-drawn best fit for eqn .
( 5 ) .
( see Fig .
66 ) , and the finding that the rate constants were independent of ligand concentration ( results not shown ) , are all consistent with the simple bimolecular model depicted in eqn .
( 1 ) .
A comparison of the rate and equilibrium constants for dexamethasone and cortisol ( Table 1 ) shows that the lower affinity of cortisol is essentially due to a faster dissociation rate .
At low temperatures at least , the latter more than compensates for the faster association rate .
For both steroids , the Arrhenius plots for the forward ( Fig .

( 10 ) - ( 12 ) ( Fig .
4b and Vol .
218 Table 1 ) .
The variation in the experimental rate constants observed at a given temperature affected the convergence of the curve-fitting algorithm , and this yielded results that were less precise than those derived from equilibrium studies .
Still , in a given experiment , the K ; , values derived from kinetic data ( k_ ; /k , , ) did not differ significantly from those determined at equilibrium ( Table 1 ) .
The thermodynamic profiles in Fig .
4 ( b ) show that at low temperature the energy barrier of the transition state was mainly due to a largely positive enthalpy change , which is partially compensated for by the favourable entropy change .
Around 15°C , the entropy change became unfavourable while the enthalpy change kept decreasing , such that the energy barrier ( AG+ ) was about the same at 25° as at 0°C .
All the thermodynamic data are summarized in energy diagrams ( Fig .
7 ) which depict the quantitative and qualitative energy changes that are thought to govern the association and dissociation processes for dexamethasone and cortisol .
Discussion The results obtained at equilibrium show that , at 0°C , the glucocorticoid-receptor interaction is partially ( for cortisol ) or totally ( for dexamethasone ) under entropic control , as suggested by Munck et al .
( 1972 ) .
This points to the importance of hydrophobic interactions , namely the partial withdrawal of non-polar groups from water , resulting in the entropically favourable dispersion of previously ordered water molecules .
The way in which temperature influenced the results obtained at equilibrium is consistent with that interpretation .
First , the entropy change decreased with increasing temperature , in keeping with the notion that the organization of water molecules is adversely influenced by temperature .
Second , .
the AC } was negative , as expected for hydrophobic interactions .
Note that the ACJ values calculated here are within the range of the values reported for ligand-protein interactions ( Sturtevant , 1977 ) .
Independent evidence for strong hydrophobic bonding stems from our earlier observation ( van Bohemen & Rousseau , 1982 ) that non-steroidal compounds - structurally unrelated to glucocorticoids bind to the receptor and competitively inhibit steroid binding to the receptor site .
These compounds do not display glucocorticoid-agonist activity , suggesting that , as expected , hydrophobic interactions are not specific , and that other forces , presumably dependent on the stereochemical properties of the steroid molecule , stabilize the receptor-steroid complex .
The effects of temperature on the binding parameters described here are also consistent with this interpretation .

25°C , neither nor AS° was positive , as would be the case for a purely hydrophobic interaction .
This suggests that hydrogen bonds , formed in the low dielectric environment of the receptor protein , and van der Waals ( stacking ) forces contribute significantly to the binding energy ( Ross & Subramanian , 1981 ) .
Concerning hydrogen bonds , the importance of proton-acceptor and proton-donor functions on the steroid molecule has been discussed elsewhere ( Munck et al. , 1972 ; Rousseau et al. , 1979 , 1983 ) .
The thermodynamic profile of cortisol binding differs qualitatively from that described for its interaction with transcortin , which is enthalpy-driven and entropically unfavourable at 4°C ( Mickelson et a/. , 1981 ) .
This suggests that the binding of steroids to plasma transport proteins and to intracellular receptors involves different molecular mechanisms .
Our data fit nicely with the two-step thermodynamic model proposed by Ross & Subramanian ( 1981 ) for ligand-protein interactions .
According 1984 Thermodynamics of glucocorticoid-receptor interactions 403 to this model , the reacting species become partially immobilized in a primarily hydrophobic association step , the mutual penetration of hydration layers causing a disorder of the solvent .
The second step involves short-range interactions , which stabilize the complex and account for the negative enthalpy change seen at high ( 25°C ) temperatures .
Consistent with this model , our analysis of the transition state shows that the energy barrier is mainly enthalpic , and stays that way at all temperatures , as predicted from an initial hydrophobic step .
At equilibrium , the negative enthalpy contribution of short-range interactions compensates for the positive enthalpy change owing to the hydrophobic contacts and , predictably , outweighs the latter at high temperatures ( Table 1 ) .
If this model is valid , then , the question as to how much of the surface of the steroid molecule is engaged in its receptor site can be re-evaluated .
This problem had been approached by Wolff et al .
( 1978 ) , using equilibrium measurements , on the basis of the relationship ( see Chothia & Janin , 1975 ) AG = AG , + AG , , where AG is the observed free energy of the hydrophobic interaction , AG , is the free energy associated with the loss of entropy when the ligands become associated , and is therefore equal to -T-AS , , and AG , is proportional to the surface area involved in hydrophobic bonding and is equal to AG , ( steroid ) + AG , ( receptor ) .
As pointed out by Ross & Subramanian ( 1981 ) , this relationship holds true only when van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds can be thermo-dynamically neglected .
This would be the case at low temperature during the first step of the model proposed above , namely for the process corresponding to the transition state at 0°C .
Using for AS , a value of -76cal ( i.e .
-318 J ) : K- ' and for the calculation of AG , a value of -2250cal ( i.e .
-9410J ) /nm > ( see Wolff et al. , 1978 ) , we find the following value for the steroid surface area ( S4 ) presumably involved in receptor binding : -T. -AGt $ A =M -AG ( 273 x 0.318 ) -45.6 i 2 x 9.41 = 2.2nm The surface area of the cortisol molecule accessible to the solvent has been estimated as 5.7nm ' ( Schmit & Rousseau , 1978 ) .
It thus seems unlikely that the steroid molecule becomes 'buried ' in the receptor protein .
This interpretation is consistent with the AC } $ value observed for cortisol at 25°C .
According to Sturtevant ( 1977 ) , when short-range interactions and conformational changes can be neglected , the AC , resulting from hydrophobic Vol .
218 forces at 25°C , AC , ( hydro ) , can be expressed as : 1.05 -AC , -AS 1.31 These conditions would be met during the first step in the model proposed , which we have assumed to be described by our analysis of the transition state .
By introducing in eqn .
( 15 ) the values for AC } J and ASt given in Table 1 , one obtains a value for AC , ( hydro ) of -1017J -K Assuming that each mol of water dispersed contributes 5.6cal ( i.e .
23.43 ) K- ' to the AC , ( hydro ) at 25°C ( Sturtevant , 1977 ) , this value would correspond to about 20 molecules of water lost per complementary molecular surface area .
On the basis of a van der Waals radius of 0.14nm for the water molecule ( Chothia , 1975 ) , the interaction would involve about 2.5 nm of steroid surface , which is in agreement with the value ( 2.2nm > ) calculated from the AG+ value .
Finally , our experiments show that receptors bound by antagonists are thermolabile , or become undetectable by our assay procedure when temperature increases ( Jones & Bell , 1982 ) .
Receptor thermolability has been ascribed to oxidation of thiol groups and to a molybdate-sensitive ( dephos-phorylation ? )
process ( Houslay et a/. , 1982 ) .
The presence of dithiothreitol and molybdate in the incubation mixture would prevent such mechanisms from taking place , and indeed agonist-bound and free receptors remained stable under our experimental conditions .
Thus it is likely that , on binding an antagonist , the receptor assumes a conformation that differs from that engaged in agonist binding or from the unbound state .
