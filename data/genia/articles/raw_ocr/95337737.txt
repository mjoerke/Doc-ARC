IL-5 also stimulates GTP binding to p21 '' .
The signal is subsequently propagated through the activation of Raf-l , MEK , and MAP kinases as shown by their increased autophosphorylation in vitro and phosphorylation in situ .
Jak2 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate STAT nuclear proteins .
The activation of STAT nuclear factors was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a y activation site ( GAS ) probe .
We found that IL-5 induces two GAS-binding proteins in eosinophils , one of which is STAT 1 .
We conclude that IL-5 induced signals are propagated through two distinct pathways : ( 1 ) Lyn-Ras-Raf-l-MEK-MAP kinase and ( 2 ) Jak2-STAT1 .
Materials and Methods Eosinophils play an integral role in the pathogenesis of allergic and parasitic disorders .
Interleukin ( IL ) -5 is the principal cytokine that regulates the growth , survival and function of eosinophils .
The receptor for IL-5 consists of a and [ 3 subunits .
Neither of the receptor subunits has intrinsic enzymatic activity .
The mechanism of intracellular signaling by these receptors is currently unknown .
It is speculated that tyrosine kinases associate with the receptor and are activated following receptor dimerization .
The objective of this study was to investigate the signal transduction mechanism of IL-5 .
Eosinophils ( > 98 % ) were purified from mildly eosinophilic ( 6 8 % ) donors using discontinous Percoll gradients .
The kinases were studied by immunoprecipitation , immunoblotting , immune-complex kinase assay , in situ phosphorylation , in situ denatured/renatured kinase assay , the GT P-overlay technique and thin-layer chromatography analysis according to previously published methods [ 1-3 ] .
Results and Discussion Many tyrosine kinases have been shown to associate with cytokine receptors .
Lyn , a member of the Sre tyrosine family , has been detected in cells of myeloid origin .

1073-0226 $ 8.00/0 reason , we investigated the involvement of Lyn kinase in eosinophils .
We detected two species of Lyn kinase ( 56 and 53 kD ) in eosinophils .
Both were phosphorylated and activated within I min following IL-5 stimulation of cosino-phils .
Tyrosine kinase activates many downstream-signaling molecules including a group of proteins that exchange GDP for GTP on Ras .
The latter exists in inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms .
We studied the effect of IL-5 on the GTP-binding of Ras using two different techniques .
We found that IL-5 stimulated the binding of GTP to p21 within 1-3 min by the GTP-overlay technique .
The Ras-bound GTP and GDP were also analyzed by thin-layer chromatography which confirmed the increased binding of GTP .
The GTP-bound Ras causes translocation of Raf-l to the membrane and its activation .
Raf-1 then phosphorylates MEK kinase which subsequently activates MAP kinases .
The effect of IL-5 on the Raf-1-MEK-MAP kinase pathway has not been investigated .
We studied the kinases by immune-complex assay using either endogenous substrates or autophosphorylation .
MAP kinases were further studied by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation and in situ phosphorylation .
We found that Raf-2 and MEK were activated within 3 min after IL-5 stimulation .
Both 45- and 41-kD species of MEK were present and activated in cosino-phils .
The activity of p44 MAP kinase was studied in eosinophils using a monoclonal antibody and was found to peak at 20 min .
The optimal concentration of IL-5 for stimulation of kinases was 10 `` -10 '' M , which agrees with other biolog-ic activities of this cytokine on eosinophils .
In another set of studies , we demonstrated that IL-5 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 kinase within 3 min .
Activated Jak2 underwent autophosphorylation in situ .
Jak2 is known to phosphorylate nuclear factors of the STAT family .
Next , we studied the activation of STAT proteins in the nuclear extract of eosinophils .
An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with an interferon-y activation site ( GAS ) probe from the promoter region of the IL-5 Receptor QP Eosinophil ( stat { c-jun c-myc NFkB l NFILG elk-1 T TCF - ATF s Nucleus Fig .

A schematic presentation of two major signaling pathways of IL-5 .
Ly6 gene .
We found that IL-5 induced two GAS-binding proteins in the nuclear extract from eosinophils .
One of them was identified as STAT 1 ( p91 ) , as shown by supershift-ing of the band in the presence of an anti-STAT1 antibody .
Thus , we have identified two major signaling pathways in eosinophils ( fig .
1 ) .
The final products of these two pathways include MAP kinases and STATI .
MAP kinases activate many cytosolic proteins including phospholipase A2 ( PLA ; ) , phospholipase C ( PLC ) , Rsk , and cytoskeleton proteins .
Further , MAP kinases migrate into the nucleus and phosphorylate nuclear factors such as NFIL6 , c-Jun , c-Myc , Elk-1 , TCF and others .
The activation of Raf-1 leads to the generation of NF-z B. PLA ; is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid and generation of prostaglandins and leu-kotrienes .
PLC facilitates the production of inositol triphos-phates and diacylglycerol .
The nuclear factors may be involved in the transcription of genes that are responsible for prolongation of survival and priming of the cells .
