Activation-induced Down-regulation of Retinoid Receptor RXRa Expression in Human T Lymphocytes ROLE OF CELL CYCLE REGULATION®* ( Received for publication , February 10 , 1998 , and in revised form , June 5 , 1998 ) Mohammad Ishaqt $ § , Yi-Ming Zhang ' 1 , and Ven Natarajan } From the { Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology and the Laboratory of Molecular Retrovirology , SAIC-Frederick , National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , Maryland 21702-1201 A 5.4-kilobase mRNA , the expression of which is down-regulated after treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with various T cell-activating agents , was isolated using an mRNA differential display method .
Nucleotide sequence analysis identified the 5 ' end of this RNA as human retinoid receptor RXRa mRNA .
Here , we report the nucleotide sequence of 3.6 kilobases of this RNA , which represents the 3 ' end of RXRa mRNA , the sequence of which has not been previously described .
Activated PBMCs also expressed lower levels of RXRa protein , and a DNA binding assay showed that the activation-induced loss of RXRa mRNA and protein expression correlated with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein .
We present evidence that the transition from G/G , to S phase of the cell cycle results in the down-regulation of RXRa expression and that cell cycle inhibitors , which block the cells in G , phase , prevent this down-regulation .
The decrease in the levels of RXRa mRNA was found to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level and involved new protein synthe-sis .
These observations indicate that the levels of RXRa expression in T lymphocytes are coupled to cell cycle progression , and there is tight regulatory control of RXRa expression during the transition from G/G , to S phase of the cell cycle .
During the physiological response to antigens , T cells are activated through the interaction of the processed antigen with the TCR-CD3 complex , resulting in a complex signaling pathway that culminates in cellular proliferation and a specific immune response .
The activation of T cells is a highly regulated process , which involves transcriptional control of many genes ( 1 ) .
Among the well characterized pathways of TCR !

21210 signaling are the activation of protein kinase C and the increase in the intracellular calcium levels ( 2 , 3 ) , both of which are involved in the transcriptional control of several genes .
The genes that are activated early in T cell activation include IL2 , IL2 receptor , and the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc ( 1 ) .
Antibodies against a number of T cell surface molecules have been shown to induce T cell activation .
Among these are CD3 , TCR « B , CD2 , Thy-1 , and Ly-6 ( 4-9 ) .
The activation of resting peripheral blood T cells by TCR-CD3 ligation can be mimicked by treatment with phorbol myristate and ionomycin ( ION ) , which induce protein kinase C activation and an increase in the intracellular calcium pool ( 10 ) .
In addition , lectins like phyto-hemagglutinin ( PHA ) or concanavalin A can induce T cell activation in normal peripheral blood T cells ( 9 ) .
Retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) and retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) are a group of nuclear receptors involved in retinoic acid-mediated gene activation ( 11 , 12 ) .
After ligand binding , these receptors exert their action by binding , as homodimers or heterodimers , to specific sequences in the promoters of target genes and regulate their transcription .
Retinoid receptor functions can also be mediated by a pathway that does not require receptor-DNA interaction .
This mechanism involves interaction of nuclear receptors and the transcription factor AP-1 ( c-Jun/c-Fos ) , which results in the inhibition of AP-1 activity ( 13 ) .
Recent studies have shown that retinoic acid inhibits activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas and thymo-cytes , and RXRs may have a role in this protection ( 14-17 ) .
To understand the molecular basis of T cell activation , the analysis of changes in gene expression after activation is of prime importance .
We are interested in the identification of genes that are involved in T cell activation , proliferation , and cell death .
A recently described PCR-based method called differential display PCR ( 18 , 19 ) has been used to isolate genes and study their differential expression ( 20-22 ) .
In this report using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( DD-RT-PCR ) , we describe the isolation of an approximately 5.4-kb mRNA from human PBMCs , the expression of which is down-regulated after treatment of PBMCs or purified T lymphocytes with various T cell-activating agents .
Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that the 5 end of this mRNA ( approximately 1.8 kb ) is homologous to the published sequences of human RXRa , and the 3 ' end ( approximately 3.6 kb ) does not match any sequences in the GenBank except some expressed sequence tags .
We show that this 3.6-kb sequence represents the 3 ' end of the human RXRa mRNA , the sequence of which has not been previously reported in the literature .
We also provide evidence that the activation-induced down-regulation of expression of RXRa « can be prevented by treatments that block cells in G , phase and prevent activation and transition into the S phase of the cell cycle , indicating cell cycle regulation of RXRa expression in T cells .

RESULTS Cloning and Sequencing of Differentially Expressed Human RXRa mRNA and Isolation of 3° Sequences-Electrophoretic analysis of OKT3-treated and untreated DD-RT-PCR products revealed a complex pattern of different cDNAs .
A number of differentially amplified products were cloned and sequenced .
One of them ( designated clone 5 ) , which was down-regulated in OKT3-treated PBMCs ( Fig .
1 ) and was not related to any known sequence in the GenBank , was further studied .
Northern blot hybridization using the clone 5 cDNA probe identified this RNA as an approximately 5.4-kb RNA that was expressed in PBMCs and also in a number of human tissues like spleen , thymus , prostate , testis , ovary , small intestine , and colon ( data not shown ) .
Based on the sequence information obtained from the clone 5 , 3 ' and 5 ' ends of this RNA were isolated using RACE .
An approximately 450-base pair sequence ( excluding the poly ( A ) tail ) was identified by 3 ' RACE , and 3.1 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained by 5 RACE and 5 genomic DNA walking , followed by RT-PCR using primers from genomic DNA sequences .

Differential display of a down-regulated mRNA .
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of DD-RT-PCR products showing down-regulation of an mRNA ( marked with an arrow and later shown to be RXRa ) after treatment of PBMCs with OKT3 for 72 h. Lanes 1 and 2 are RT-PCR products from untreated and OKT3-treated PBMCs , respectively .
otides from the 5 end of this newly isolated cDNA were identical to human RXRa ( 24 ) .
RXRa mRNA has been characterized as a 5.4-kb mRNA , but only about 1.8 kb of the mRNA sequence has been reported ( 24 ) .
RT-PCR using primers from the newly isolated sequences and the published regions of RXRa yielded the expected size cDNA PCR products , and sequence analysis of these PCR products established that the newly isolated sequence was indeed the 3 ' end of human RXRa mRNA .
This was further confirmed by Northern blot hybridization using an RXRa cDNA probe prepared by PCR using the primers from the published RXRa cDNA sequences .
This probe hybridized to the same 5.4-kb RNA as did the probe from the newly isolated sequence ( data not shown ) .
Sequence analysis of the newly isolated RNA ( approximately 3.6 kb ) showed two additional open reading frames designated ORF-2 ( 2125-2877 ) and ORF-3 ( 4260-4754 ) , which can code for polypeptides of 251 and 165 amino acids , respectively ( data not shown ) .
CD3 Cross-linking Induces Down-regulation of RXRa Expression in PBMCs-Treatment of PBMCs with anti-CD3 antibodies resulted in the activation of T cells as shown by [ H ] thymidine incorporation .
RNase protection assay ( Fig .
24 ) and RT-PCR ( using primers from the newly isolated sequence and from the published RXRa sequence ) were used to estimate the relative levels of RXRa mRNA .
There was an approximately 90 % decrease in the levels of RXRa mRNA when PBMCs were treated with OKT3 for 72 h. Fig .
2B shows the kinetics of this down-regulation .
The data show that there was a 70 % decrease in the RXRa mRNA levels in first 24 h and , after 72 h of OKT3 treatment , a 90-95 % reduction in the level of the RXRa mRNA .
For comparison , cDNA samples were also amplified with IL2-receptor specific primers that served as an activation marker .
To demonstrate that the down-regulation of RXRa mRNA was T cell-specific , purified CD4*/CD8* T cells were treated with OKT3 or the combination of PMA + ION , known to induce T cell activation ( 10 ) .
The levels of RXRa mRNA were reduced in the purified T cells after both treatments ( data not shown ) .
Western blot analysis revealed that the OKT3-induced down-regulation of RXRa was also observed at the protein level ( Fig .
3 ) .
Down-regulation of RXRa mRNA Expression in PBMCs by Other T Cell-activating Agents-To investigate whether the decrease in the RXRa mRNA expression , seen after CD3 cross-linking of PBMCs , could also be achieved by stimulating cells with other known T cell-proliferating agents , we treated PBMCs with immobilized monoclonal anti-TCR « f antibody , PMA Activation-induced RXRa Down-regulation in T Lymphocytes A Probe OKT3 Treated Untreated we _ < - 302 ( RXRo ) ' < - 113 ( L32 ) < - 96 ( GAPDH ) & < - L32 < - GAPDH B 1 2 3 4 506 7 8 RXRe @ * - @ IL-2R “ - © - e rRNA @ @ @ OC @ % eee Fic .

Results presented in Fig .
4C show the relative effectiveness of different activating agents in inducing the down-regulation of RXRa mRNA expression .
The Effect of OKT3-induced Activation on DNA Binding Activity of RXRa-Retinoid receptors bind to specific DNA sequences called retinoic acid response elements ( RAREs ) .
The core motif of these RAREs is AGGTCA .
Using natural and synthetic RAREs , it has been shown that RXRs preferentially bind and activate direct repeat elements in which core motifs are separated by 1 or 2 base pairs ( 28-80 ) .
To determine if the down-regulation of RXRa levels after activation were reflected in a comparable difference in DNA binding activity of this protein , the DNA binding activity was studied by EMSA using oligonucleotides corresponding to CRBPII RXRE .
As can be seen from Fig .
5 , there is almost complete loss of DNA binding activity after the treatment of PBMCs with OKT3 .
When the same nuclear extracts were analyzed for AP-1 binding by EMSA , there was 6-fold increase in the AP-1 binding activity of OKT3-treated PBMCs .
The levels of a constitutively expressed transcription factor Spl ( 31 ) showed only a moderate increase ( less than 2-fold ) after activation , indicating that the integrity and the amount of nuclear extracts derived from activated PBMCs were comparable with that from untreated cells .
These data indicate that T cell activation , which is associated with a marked increase in AP-1 binding activity , nevertheless results in the loss of RXR binding activity .
Thus , activation-induced loss of RXRa mRNA and protein expression in T cells correlates with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein .
Low Level Expression of RXRa mRNA Is a Feature of Actively Dividing T Cells-To study the fate of RXRa mRNA expression in actively proliferating human T cells , freshly isolated PBMCs were treated with PHA and IL2 for 3-4 days .
The cells were washed to remove the PHA and maintained in IL2 .
Flow cy-tometry revealed that the proliferating cells were > 98 % CD3* T lymphocytes .
The kinetics of alteration of RXRa mRNA expression ( Fig .

This low level expression of RXRa mRNA was maintained throughout T cell proliferation .
These results indicate that the expression of RXRa : in T lymphocytes may be cell cycle-regulated .
Inhibition of Activation-induced RXRa Down-regulation by Inhibitors of T Cell Activation and Cell Cycle Regulation of RXRa Expression-CsA inhibits T cell activation by inhibiting calcineurin ( a Ca**/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase ) , which , in turn , inhibits the transcription of IL2 .
Because the binding of IL2 to its receptor is important for the progression from the G , to the S phase of the cell cycle ( 82 ) , signaling through the IL2 receptor is inhibited in the absence of IL2 , and the cells are prevented from entering into the S phase of the cell cycle .
RAP does not affect the production of IL2 but does inhibit signals transmitted via the IL2 receptor at least in part by inhibiting the IL2-induced phosphorylation and activation of p70°°* ( 83 ) .
In the presence of RAP , IL2-stimulated T cells are blocked in G , ( 34 ) .
To study the cell cycle regulation of RXRa expression in T cells , PBMCs were treated with OKT3 in presence of CsA or RAP .
Measurement of [ °H ] thymidine incorporation ( Fig .
44 ) showed that both CsA and RAP inhibited cellular activation induced by TCR-CD3 cross-linking .
This was accompanied by inhibition of activation-induced down-regulation of RXRa mRNA expression ( Fig .
4B ) .
CsA was more effective than RAP in preventing the down-regulation of RXRa mRNA expression induced by OKT3 .
In addition , CsA inhibited the down-regulation of RXRa mRNA expression induced by anti-TCR af antibody ( Fig .
4C ) .
CsA inhibition of OKT3-induced RXRa down-regulation was completely prevented by the addition of IL2 ( Fig .
7A ) , suggesting that IL2 may be necessary for the activation-induced decrease in RXRa .
To study the possibility that the IL2 effect may be mediated by regulation of the cell cycle , we treated PBMCs with OKT3 in the presence of mimosine , a rare plant amino acid that blocks the cell cycle at the G ; phase by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 5-A ( eIF5-A ) ( 35 ) ( Table I ) , either alone or in combination with IL2 .
As shown in Fig .
7A , mimosine completely inhibited the OKT3-induced down-regulation of RXRa expression .
IL2 had no effect in preventing this inhibition .
Consistent with the inability of IL2 to release the G ; block induced by mimosine ( Table I ) , the inhibition of RXRa down-regulation could not be prevented by treatment with IL2 .

Cell cycle regulation of RXRa expression in PBMCs and proliferating T cells .
A , PBMCs ( 10®/ml ) were treated for 72 h as indicated .
RXRa mRNA was quantitated by RT-PCR .
B , 7-10-day-old proliferating peripheral T cells were treated with 100 ug/ml mimosine for 24 h. Cells were washed three times with medium to remove mimosine and cultured in fresh medium .
Cells were harvested after indicated time periods , and dead cells were removed by Ficoll gradient centrifugation .
Cell cycle analysis was performed , and RXRa mRNA level was estimated by RT-PCR as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''

Moreover , the effect of IL2 in preventing the CsA-induced inhibition of RXRa down-regulation was correlated to the release of the CsA-induced G , block ( Table I ) .
Further proof that the levels of RXRa are cell cycle-regulated came from the experiment in which actively dividing peripheral T lymphocytes , which express low levels of RXRa mRNA as compared with the resting cells , were treated with mimosine for 24 h.

Nuclear run-on analysis .
Transcriptional analysis was performed with untreated and OKT3-treated PBMCs ( A ) and mimosine-treated and 9-h released peripheral T cells ( B ) as described under `` Experimental Procedures '' using indicated linearized plasmids .
Vector without the insert was used as a negative control .
This experiment is a representative of three independent experiments .
blocked the cells in G , phase and resulted in a marked up-regulation of RXRa mRNA .
When the mimosine block was released to allow progression into the cell cycle , the levels of RXRa mRNA decreased progressively and , in 24 h after re-lease , reached the levels seen in actively cycling untreated cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
Regulation of RXRa mRNA Expression during Cell Cy-cle-To study the involvement of transcriptional or post-tran-scriptional factors in the regulation of RXRa mRNA expression during T cell activation and transition from G/G ; to the S phase , we measured the transcription of RXRa mRNA in OKT3-treated PBMCs and mimosine-blocked and -released proliferating peripheral blood T cells , using nuclear run-on transcription assay .
The results indicate ( Fig .
8 ) that the levels of RXRa mRNA synthesis show only moderate ( less than 2-fold ) increase during G/G , block .
Next , we analyzed the effect of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on the loss of RXRa mRNA levels during mimosine release .
As shown in Fig .
9 , Act D had no effect on the kinetics of RXRa mRNA down-regulation during mimosine release .
In contrast , when mimosine release was carried out in the presence of CHX , there was a marked inhibition of RXRa mRNA down-regulation .
Together , these data suggest that the loss of RXRa mRNA expression during G/G ; to S transition is partly due to the decrease in the gene transcription but is primarily a result of decreased mRNA stability .
In addition , CHX may block the synthesis of post-transcrip-tional regulatory factor ( s ) capable of modulating the RXRa mRNA levels during G/G ; to S transition .
DISCUSSION Although there is a growing list of genes that are known to be up-regulated after T cell activation ( 1 ) , there are only a few that are known to be inhibited after activation ( 36-38 ) .
We have utilized the DD-RT-PCR technique to identify and analyze the genes involved in T cell activation .
In this paper , we chose to characterize one such gene and have identified the newly isolated sequence as the unpublished 3 ' end of the 5.4-kb human RXRa mRNA .
We have shown that the activation of PBMCs resulted in the down-regulation of RXRa mRNA , protein , and DNA binding activity .

Effect of Act D and CHX on the RXRa mRNA down-regulation during G , to S switch .
Peripheral blood T cells were treated with mimosine as described .
Cells were washed to remove mimosine and maintained in IL2 in presence of Act D or CHX as described .
Cells were harvested after the indicated time intervals , and RXRa mRNA was quantitated by RT-PCR .
The values represent the mean of three independent experiments with standard error calculated for each value .
most effective were those that induced maximum activation .
These data demonstrate that down-regulation of RXRa mRNA expression is an event associated with the T cell activation induced by a variety of stimuli , and the level of down-regulation reflects the extent of cellular activation .
The finding that the low levels of RXRa are maintained throughout active T cell proliferation as compared with the resting cells is consistent with the possibility of cell cycle regulation of RXRa expression .
The activation-induced down-regulation of RXRa mRNA expression was inhibited by agents that blocked the cells in G , phase , suggesting that the cell cycle block in G , phase accounted for such inhibition .
Because IL2 prevented only the CsA but not the mimosine-induced inhibition of RXRa down-regulation by OKT3 , we suspect that the IL2 effect is most likely mediated by the regulation of cell cycle ( through the release of the CsA-induced G , block ) .
Our conclusion that the RXRa mRNA levels are cell cycle regulated is further supported by the studies on the effect of mimosine on actively dividing peripheral T lymphocytes , where large populations of cells were in S phase and RXRa levels were low .
Mimosine inhibited proliferation , blocked the cells in the G ; phase , and resulted in significant up-regulation of RXRa mRNA .
The release of mimosine-induced G ; block was accompanied by progression into cell cycle and a progressive loss of RXRa mRNA expression .
The molecular mechanism of activation-induced down-regulation of RXRa mRNA remains unknown .
The data obtained on the role of transcriptional and postranscriptional mechanisms in regulating the levels of RXRa mRNA during T cell activation and G ; to S switch show that the down-regulation of RXRa mRNA is primarily the result of a decrease in the mRNA stability and partly the result of a decrease in the gene tran-scription ; new protein synthesis is required to accomplish this .
The -untranslated sequence of RX Ra mRNA contains a single copy of AUUUA sequence .
This sequence has been identified as the mRNA instability signal involved in the mRNA decay ( 39 ) .
Whereas the role of this sequence in the stability of RXRa mRNA remains to be studied , this sequence alone may not account for the RXRa mRNA destabilization during Gy/G ; to S switch .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 21216 Together , our data indicate that the levels of RXRa expression in T lymphocytes are coupled to cell cycle progression , and there is tight regulatory control of RX Ra expression during the transition from G/G , to S phase of the cell cycle .
RXRs along with RARs have the ability to silence transcription in the absence of ligand ( 40 ) .
It is known that T cell activation induces expression of transcription factor AP-1 ( 41 , 42 ) .
Retinoid receptors regulate transcriptional activation either through receptor-DNA interactions or by inhibiting AP-1 ( 13 ) .
It can be speculated that the levels of RXRa in resting T lymphocytes are inhibitory to AP-1 activity and prevent AP-1-induced gene transcription and proliferation .
Thus , RXRa may play an important role by providing a switch that allows operation of a signaling system that controls fine tuning of regulation of T cell proliferation .
Recent data suggest that RXRs may have a role in the prevention of activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas and thymocytes ( 14-17 ) .
It has been shown that activation-induced apoptosis can be prevented by treatment with 9-cis retinoic acid , a ligand that has very high affinity for the RXR receptor ( 16 , 17 ) .
These findings , together with our results , point to a role of RXRs in general and RXRa in particular in the regulation of T lymphocyte activation , proliferation , and cell death .
