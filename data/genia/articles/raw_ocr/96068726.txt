RAPID COMMUNICATION The Myeloid Zinc Finger Gene , MZF-1 , Regulates the CD34 Promoter In Vitro By Jennifer F. Morris , Frank J. Rauscher III , Brian Davis , Michael Klemsz , Dawei Xu , Daniel Tenen , and Robert Hromas MZF-1 is a C2H2 zinc finger gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of myeloid differentiation .
The MZF-1 protein contains 13 C2H2 zinc fingers arranged in bipartite DNA binding domains containing zinc fingers 1 through 4 and , in the carboxy-terminus , 5 through 13 .
We previously identified the DNA consensus binding site recognized by the two DNA binding domains .
To assess the transcription regulatory function of MZF-1 , the full-length MZF-1 coding region was fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transacti-vator GAL4 .
The expression vector was cotransfected with the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene regulated by the thymidine kinase promoter containing GAL4 DNA binding sites into NIH 313 , 293 , K562 , and Jurkat cell lines .
MZF-1 represses CAT reporter gene expression via GAL4 binding sites in the nonhematopoietic cell lines NIH 3T3 and 293 .
In contrast , MZF-1 activates CAT reporter gene expression in the hematopoietic cell lines K562 and Jurkat .
The MZF-1 binding sites are present in the promoters of several genes expressed during myeloid differentiation , in EMATOPOIESIS is a complex process during which pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow proliferate , differentiate , and mature into individual peripheral blood cell types .
At the molecular level , the process of hematopoiesis is best described as a tightly regulated signal transduction cascade .
Environmental signals are received at the cell surface by growth factors binding to receptors .
This initial signal is transduced from the cell surface , via secondary mes-sengers , to the nucleus , where specific transcription factors From Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , Medical College of Wis-consin , Milwaukee , WI ; The Wistar Institute , Philadelphia , PA ; The Cancer Center , The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston , Galveston , TX ; Hematology/Oncology and Microbiclogy/Immu-nology , The Walther Oncology Center , The Indiana University Medical Center , Indianapolis , IN ; and Department of Hematology , Beth Israel Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA .

MZF-1 transcriptional regulation of this physiologically relevant promoter was assessed in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines .
Recombinant MZEF-1 protein specifically binds to the consensus binding sites in the CD34 promoter in mobility shift assays .
MZF-1 expression vectors were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids regulated by the CD34 promoter into both nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cell lines .
As with the heterologous DNA binding domain , MZF-1 represses reporter gene expression in nonhematopoietic cell lines and activates expression in hematopoietic cell lines .
Activation of CD34 expression in hematopoietic cell lines is dependent on the presence of intact MZF-1 binding sites .

Transcription factors have a pivotal role in translating the cell surface signal into a specific pathway of differentiation by specifying which genes will be actively used by a cell at a particular time in development . '' ''
Transcriptional regulators can be classified into families based on the expression of distinct structural/functional domains characterized by conserved amino acid sequences .
* '' Zinc finger genes ' represent one family of proteins that form such a domain when the conserved amino acids cysteine and histidine bind a central zinc ion .
Zinc finger genes can be further classified by their finger domain structures .
The C2H2 zinc finger family , exemplified by Krupple , a Drosophila gap gene , '' contains the highly conserved peptide motif CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H .
Zinc fingers usually occur in repeats , and individual fingers are separated by a conserved region called the H-C link .
The Krupple family members usually contain the H-C link motif of TGEKPYX .
Many members of the C2H2 zinc finger gene family regulate differentiation processes , and genetic mutations in some zinc finger genes have been associated with specific human dis-eases . ''
The myeloid zinc finger gene 1 , MZF-1 , is a putative transcription factor of the C2H2 zinc finger gene family .

MZF-1 REGULATES CD34 MZF1 Fig 1 .
Schematic of the MZF-1 protein and its peptide domains .
The MZF-1 protein has 13 zinc fin- - ; ZN 1-4 ger domains ( ZN 1-4 and ZN 5-13 ) separated into two sections by a glycine-proline rich region .
There is an ZN 5413 acidic region in the 5¢ portion of the protein .
lular , and biochemical characterization .
MZF-1 encodes a protein with 13 C2H2 zinc fingers arranged in two DNA binding domains ( Fig 1 ) .
We have previously identified the core DNA consensus binding site for each of the two DNA binding domains . ''
The first domain of fingers 1-4 ( ZN 1-4 ) binds to the core sequence and the second domain of fingers 5-13 ( ZN 5-13 ) binds the core sequence 5-CGGGnGAGGGGGAA-3 ' .
We have identified MZF-1 binding sites in the promoter regions of several genes that are differentially expressed during myeloid differentiation , including CD34 .
This present study found that MZPF-1 regulated the CD34 promoter in a tissue-specific manner .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines .
- All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) .
The cell lines NIH 3T3 ( murine embryonic fibroblast ) , 293 ( human adenovirus-transformed kidney cells ) , and Hela ( cervical carcinoma cells ) were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) plus 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics .
The cell lines K562 ( human erythroleuke-mia from chronic myelogenous leukemia ) , Jurkat ( human acute T-cell leukemia ) , and KG-1 ( human acute myelogenous leukemia ) were grown in RPMI 1640 plus 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics .
Hela , NIH 3T3 , 293 , and Jurkat cell lines do not express MZF-1 , and the K562 and KG-1 cells express MZEF-1 .
In addition , KG-1 cells are CD34* , whereas the other cell lines do not express CD34 .
Thus , these cell lines represent the possible variations in phenotype needed to test MZF-1 regulation of the CD34 promoter in this study , ie nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic , MZF-1 expressing and nonexpressing , and CD34* and CD34~ .
GALA assays .
Chimeric proteins were produced that fuse the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain to the full-length MZF-1 protein ( Fig 1 ) .
Full-length MZF-1 was used because the zinc finger domains may have transcriptional regulatory activity that would be masked if they were deleted .
The coding region of MZF-1 was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -amplified using a sense oligonucleotide that inserts an EcoRI restriction enzyme site ( 5'-TTATAGAATTCA-TGAATGGTCCCCTT-3 ' ) and an antisense oligonucleotide that inserts an Xba I restriction site ( 5'-TCACTGGTCTAGACTACTCGG-CGCTGTG-3 ' ) .
The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and Xba I and subcloned into the GALA expression plasmid pSG424 '' to produce a GAL4-MZF fusion protein containing the entire MZF-1 coding region 3 ' of the GALA zinc finger region ( Fig 2 ) .
The fusion construct was confirmed using dideoxy DNA sequencing .
The GAL4-MZF-1 fusion plasmid was cotransfected with a CAT reporter plasmid , pGAL4-5/tk-CAT , containing 5 GAL4 binding sites preceding the minimal thymidine kinase promoter regulating expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene . ''
The GAL4 binding sites are distinct from the MZF-1 binding sites .

This allowed a more direct comparison of the activation seen in hematopoietic lines compared with the repression seen in nonhematopoietic lines .
CAT activity was measured from whole cell lysates 36 hours after transfection .
CD34 promoter assays .
- A 1.2-kb BamHI-Sac I DNA fragment of the CD34 promoter ( -1.1 to +78 from the transcriptional start site according to He et al '' '' ) was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ .
The reporter fragment was then excised and subcloned onto the BamHI-Sac I sites of pGL2Basic ( Promega , Madison , WI ) to create the CD34 luciferase reporter construct '' ( here termed CD34-Luc ) used in this study .
This fragment contains three MZF-1 DNA binding sites .
These three sites , termed A , B , and C , are at -584 , -516 , and -148 , respectively ( see Fig 4 ) .
`` * As shown below , the core guanines in these three MZF-1 binding sites were mutated to thymines using the PCR-based overlap extension method . '' ''
The CD34 promoter construct with the three MZF-1 sites mutated ( termed CD34-ABC ) was used to evaluate the binding site-dependence of MZF-1 regulation of CD34 .

Site C : wild-type , 5-AGTGGGGA-3 ' ; mutant , 5'-AGTTTTTA-3 ' .
Sites A and B have DNA sequences that contain the full-length MZEF-1 binding sites composed of the sequences recognized by ZN 1-4 and ZN 5-13 ( Fig 4 ) .
Site C has only a single ZN1-4 binding site .
Based on our binding site selection studies , MZF-1 will not bind to the mutated sites . ''
The entire open reading frame of MZF-1 was cloned into the EcoRI site of the expression vector CB6 , ' '' where the cDNA is driven off the CMV IE promoter . ''
This vector , termed CB6-MZF , was used in the cotransfection studies with the CD34 promoter .

MZF-1 was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and cotransfected with a CAT reporter construct with five GAL4 binding sites in front of the thymine kinase promoter .
The relative CAT activity as compared with GAL4 expression vector alone , without MZF-1 , is proportional to the transcriptional activity conferred by MZF-1 .
All transfections were normalized to B-galactosidase .
In the nonhematopoietic cells 3T3 and 293 , the relative CAT activity conferred by GAL4-MZF as compared with GAL4 alone was markedly decreased ; thus , the data are expressed as fold repression .
Because GAL4-MZF activated reporter CAT activity in the hematopoietic lines K562 and Jurkat , the data were expressed as fold induction .
CAT activity from conferred by GAL4 alone was normalized to a value of 1.0 for both nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cell lines , Each data point represents the average + the standard error { SEM ) of at least three separate cotransfections .
In some cases , the standard error is approximately the size of the line representing the average and is therefore not given an error bar .

Gel mobility shift assays .
The ability of recombinant MZF-1 protein to bind to the three sites in the CD34 promoter was assessed by the gel mobility shift assay .
Recombinant MZF-1 protein was synthesized using the histidine-containing pDS56 expression vector and recombinant protein isolated by binding to a nickel-agarose MORRIS ET AL column , as previously described . ''
The 1.2-kb BamHI-Suc I CD34 promoter fragment was digested to completion with the restriction enzyme Mse I and end-labeled with the large fragment of DNA polymerase and a '' P-dATP .
Mse I digestion of the 1.2-kb DNA fragment produced DNA fragments of 75 to 600 nucleotides .
The 600-bp fragment contains both the A and B MZF-1 binding sites and the 97-bp fragment contains site C. Consensus DNA binding sites for MZF-1 were previously isolated , '' ' and duplex oligomers from these sites were used to compete binding of recombinant MZF1 to a 234-bp CD34 promoter fragment containing sites A and B ( ~653 to -419 , according to He et al '' '' ) .
This fragment was obtained by PCR using the primers 5-GTGGAGGATGGAGT-3 ' and 5'-TTCCCTGCAAGACC-3 ' , with the CD34-Luc as template .
Transfection analysis .
The nonhematopoietic cell lines were transfected using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( BRL , Bethesda , MD } .
Log phase cells were seeded at 10° per 100-mm culture dish and incubated overnight .
Six hours before transfection , the media was changed .
Forty-eight hours after transfection , cells were harvested by scraping and washed once in phos-phate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and whole cell lysates were prepared by 3 cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.25 mol/L Tris-HCi ( pH 8.0 ) with protease inhibitors ( 1 mmol/L phenyImethyIsufonyl fluoride , 1 ug/ mL of pepstatin A , and 1 g/mL of leupeptin ) .
Lysates were assessed for CAT activity , as previously described . ''
The KG-1 , K562 , and Jurkat cells were transfected using a Bio-Rad ( Hercules , CA ) electroporator at 0.24 kV and 960 uF .
Briefly , log phase cells were placed in fresh media overnight , and then 10 '' cells in 0.4 mL were placed in a cuvette with the appropriate plasmids .
Cuvettes were allowed to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before and after electroporation .
Cells were then placed in 5 mL of media for 12 hours before lysate preparation .
Lysate preparation were identical to that for nonhematopoietic cells described above .
Luciferase activity was assessed as described . '' '' '' '
The quantity of expression vector or reporter construct was varied as required in the different cell lines to maintain CAT or luciferase values within their respective linear ranges .
When needed , empty vector was added to maintain a constant amount of DNA in each transfection .
All transfections were normalized by transfecting RSV-BGAL , a -galactosidase expression vector .
Cell lysates were assayed for -galactosidase activity , as described , '' and individual transfections were normalized for transfection efficiency .
Each transfection was performed at least three separate times to obtain the mean and standard errors .

MZF-1 REGULATES CD34 zinc finger genes by amino acid homology .
The members of this family that have been biochemically characterized are transcriptional regulators . ''
The transcriptional regulatory properties of MZF-1 had not yet been proven .
The transcriptional regulatory activity of proteins can be assessed by fusing the putative regulatory protein domain to a heterologous DNA binding domain , such as GAL4 .
To assess whether MZF-1 was a transcriptional activator or repressor GAL4-MZF was cotransfected with pGAL4-5/tk-CAT into two nonhematopoietic cell lines ( 3T3 and 293 ) and two hematopoietic cell lines ( Jurkat and K562 ) .
In this assay , the transcriptional regulatory region is provided by MZF-1 and the DNA binding domain recognizing the reporter is provided by the GAL4 zinc fingers .
There is no homology between the GAL4 zinc finger DNA binding sites and the MZF-1 binding sites .
In the two nonhematopoietic cell lines , GALA-MZF-1 repressed CAT activity ( Fig 3 ) .
In 3T3 cells , GALA4-MZF repressed CAT activity an average of 17-fold from GAL4 alone .
In 293 cells , with the same transduction procedure , GAL4-MZF repressed CAT activity by an average of 3.3-fold ( Fig 3 ) .
Surprisingly , GAL4-MZF behaved differently in hematopoietic cells .
In contrast to the nonhematopoietic cells , it was found to activate CAT expression in both cell lines ( Fig 3 ) .
In K562 cells , GAL4-MZF increased CAT activity by an average of 12.3-fold .
In Jurkat cells , GAL4-MZF increased CAT activity an average of 31.0-fold .
Therefore , based on these assays , MZF-1 had bifunctional transcriptional regulatory activity .
In one intracellular environment it functions as a transcriptional repressor and in another as an activator .
MZF-1 regulation of the CD34 promoter .
Once the GAL4 studies established MZF-1 as a transcriptional regula-tor , myeloid promoters were searched for MZF-1 binding sites .
Whereas single MZF-1 DNA binding sites were found in the lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase promoter , three MZF1 binding sites ( called A , B , and C ; Fig 4 ) were found within the CD34 promoter .
The CD34 promoter was chosen for further analysis based on the presence of these multiple MZF-1 binding sites , making it a strong candidate for regulation by MZF-1 .
To evaluate recombinant MZF-1 protein binding to these sites , mobility shift assays were performed ( Fig 5 ) .
MZF-1 bound to fragments of the CD34 promoter produced by Mse I restriction digestion containing each of these sites .
The 600-bp Mse I fragment contained two MZF-1 binding sites , termed A and B , that contained DNA consensus binding sites for both zinc finger domains 1 through 4 and 5 through 13 ( Fig 1A ) .
Recombinant MZF-1 protein fragments containing either zinc fingers 1 through 4 or 5 through 13 could bind to this CD34 fragment .
A smaller Mse I fragment of 97 bp contained a binding site that was the exact consensus for MZF-1 zinc fingers 1 through 4 .
This DNA fragment also bound recombinant MZF-1 protein .
In addition , MZF-1 binding to a 234-bp PCR fragment of the CD34 promoter containing sites A and B could be specifically competed with the cold duplex oligomers containing the consensus MZF-1 DNA binding sites as identified 3643 A AB > C > B Protein : rZN1-4 rZN5-13 Competitor : A A Probe : AB Fig 5 .
( A ) Mobility shift assays of MZF-1 binding to the CD34 promoter .
MZF-1 can bind to three sites ( termed A , B , and C ) within the CD34 promoter .
The CD34-radiolabeled fragments containing these three sites are designated by arrows .
It can be seen that recombinant MZF-1 protein , either ZN1-4 or ZN 5-13 , can bind and slow the gel mobility of these fragments .
( B ) Recombinant MZF-1 protein binding to a 234-bp CD34 promoter fragment containing both sites A and B ( -653 to -419 in He et al '' '' ) can be specifically competed with the duplex oligomers containing the consensus MZF-1 ZN1-4 and ZN5-13 binding sites identified previously . ''
The bold triangles above the gel photograph represent increasing amounts of the specific duplex oligomer .
previously ( Fig 5 ) . ''
Thus , MZF-1 protein could bind specifically to the CD34 promoter at sequences homologous to MZF-1 consensus binding sites .
The previously described pGL-basic luciferase reporter under control of the 1.2-kb CD34 promoter fragment containing all three MZF-1 binding sites and the transcriptional start site was used to assess MZF-1 regulation of the CD34 promoter ( Fig 6 ) .
Cotransfection of the expression vector CB6-MZF with this CD34-luciferase reporter plasmid '' ( here termed CD34-Luc ) into Hela cells repressed luciferase activity by an average of 5.2-fold over vector alone , at the highest CB6-MZF level .

The regulation of the a CD34 promoter by MZF-1 .
The -l expression vector CBG-MZF was 8 0.4 - cotransfected with a CD34-Luciferase reporter construct .
The activity of luciferase as compared with that of vector alone is a 0.2 - measure of the transcriptional * regulation MZF-1 confers .
In nonhematopoietic cells ( [ A ] Hela and [ B ] 313 ) , MZF-1 represses the CD34 promoter , whereas in hematopoietic cells ( [ C ] KG-1 , F | [ D ] Jurkat , and [ E ] K562 ) , MZF-1 2 ugCD34 5 ugCD34 10 ugCD34 CD34-mediated luciferase activity by an average of 4.2-fold .
This was consistent with the GAL4 studies .
MZF-1 functioned as a repressor when transcription was initiated by the CD34 promoter in nonhematopoietic cells .
However , MZF-1 activated transcription from the CD34 promoter in hematopoietic cells ( Fig 6 ) .
In Jurkat cells at the highest transfected amounts of CB6-MZF , CD34 luciferase activity was increased by an average of 7.5-fold .
In K562 cells at similar cotransfection parameters , luciferase activity was increased by an average of 18.1 -fold .
In KG-1 cells , the average increase of luciferase activity produced by CB6- activates the CD34 promoter .
MZF was 6.1-fold .
These data were also consistent with the previously described GAL4 assays .
Mutation of the three MZF-1 binding sites in CD34-Luc abrogated potential MZF-1 interactions ; CB6-MZF no longer regulated expression of CD34-mediated transcription ( Fig 6 ) .
In Jurkat and K562 cells , the activation of CD34-ABC by CB6-MZF was reduced to that of CD34-Luc baseline .

tion of GAL4-MZF fusion proteins and GAL4 binding site reporter plasmids .
We found that the transcriptional regulation by MZF-1 was dependent on the intracellular environment .
If MZF-1 was expressed in nonhematopoietic cells , then it functioned as a transcriptional repressor .
If it was expressed in hematopoietic cells , then it functioned as an activator .
This surprising finding was confirmed in several different types of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines .
Thus , it is unlikely to be due to variation within a single -- -I I -- -- 10 ug CD34 5 ug CD34ABC 10 ug CD34ABC given cell line .
In addition , in preliminary experiments , MZF1 also activated a reporter construct via its own consensus DNA binding sites in the hematopoietic cell lines , indicating that this regulatory activity was not binding site-specific .
The finding that a zinc finger gene can function as a transcriptional repressor in one type of intracellular environment and as an activator in another is interesting , but not entirely unique .
There is preliminary evidence that at least three other Krupple class zinc finger genes may also have bifunctional From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

3646 transcriptional regulatory properties .
There is evidence that Krupple itself can activate or repress transcription depending on its intracellular concentration . ''
YY1 has been shown to repress transcription from the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter .
However , when YY1 can interact with adenovirus E1A , it mediates activation through this same promoter se-quence . ''
In addition , the Wilm 's tumor suppressor zinc finger gene WTI can also mediate repression or activa-tion . '' ''
This latter case is more similar to MZF-1 , as WTI transcriptional regulatory properties appear to be dependent on which cell type transcription is assessed .
Thus , this class of zinc finger genes has far more complex regulatory characteristics than previously thought .
The second portion of this investigation studied the binding to and transcriptional regulation of the CD34 promoter by MZF-1 .
Recombinant MZF-1 could bind to sites within the CD34 promoter by mobility shift assay .
Cotransfection assays showed that , in nonhematopoietic cells , MZF-1 repressed the CD34 promoter , whereas , in hematopoietic cells , MZEF-1 activated the CD34 promoter .
This was entirely consistent with the GAL4 and heterologous promoter studies , indicating that even with a physiologically relevant promoter such as CD34 MZF-1 still had bifunctional transcriptional regulatory properties .
The hematopoietic-specific activation of the CD34 promoter occurred in cells not expressing MZF1 or CD34 ( Jurkat ) , cells expressing MZF-1 but not CD34 ( K562 ) , and cells expressing both MZF-1 and CD34 ( KG-1 ) .
Thus , the activation of the CD34 promoter appeared dependent on whether the cell was of hematopoietic origin .
It is likely that the regulation of the CD34 promoter was dependent on the three MZF-1 binding sites , because mutation of these three sites returned CD34 expression to baseline levels in hematopoietic cells .
The relative contribution of each binding site , and whether the full or half-MZF binding sites have different regulatory roles , remains to be estab-lished .
Still , it appears that MZF-1 mediates transcription through binding to sequences homologous to previously defined consensus MZF-1 binding sites .
In earlier reports we described the cloning and characterization of the CD34 promoter . ''
The CD34 promoter had activity in many cell types , including cells not of hematopoietic origin .
Although there is a 3 ' region that may enhance hematopoietic specific expression of CD34 , '' there are probably other sequence elements not yet isolated that control the complete tissue specificity of the gene .
Other regions could produce silencing of the gene when levels of CD34 decline .
It should be noted that , although MZF-1 can regulate the CD34 promoter in vitro as shown here , proving it has a biologically relevant role in regulating CD34 expression in marrow progenitors requires more definitive analysis , such as a knock-out of the MZF-1 gene .
It is also quite possible that MZF-1 is just a part of the complex activation of the CD34 promoter ; there may easily be additional activating factors in the appropriate cells .
Lending evidence to this view is another study that found that c-myb and c-ets-2 also activated the CD34 promoter , although in nonhematopoietic cells . ''
C-ets-2 is expressed ubiqui-tously , whereas c-myb 's expression pattern resembles MZF-1 .
There are sequences within the CD34 promoter that are MORRIS ET AL homologous to ets and myb binding sites .
How c-ets-2 and c-myb might interact with MZF-1 is not known .
However , what is clear is that the regulation of CD34 gene expression is multifactorial .
It is possible that MZF-1 is a general myeloid transcription factor .
Searches of other myeloid promoters found several consensus MZF-1 DNA binding sites .
There was one MZF1 binding site in the human myeloperoxidase promoter at -278 , according to Morishita et al . '' ''
Recombinant MZF-1 protein will bind to this site in a mobility shift assay .
There was one binding site within the human lactoferrin promoter that perfectly matched the consensus for ZN1-4 at -82 , according to Johnston et al . '' ''
Recombinant MZF-1 protein will also bind to this sequence .
How MZF-1 would function in the complex regulation of these promoters is not known .
Both lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase are expressed at different stages of myeloid development as compared with CD34 .
However , MZF-1 is expressed during the stages that all three of these genes are expressed . '' '' ''
It is possible that MZF-1 may function as a necessary but not sufficient activator of many myeloid genes .
Stably transfecting an expression vector containing MZF-1 into nonmyeloid cell lines and assessing myeloid gene transcription may answer some of these questions .
Two additional features of MZF-1 add other dimensions to the data presented here .
First , we have found that overex-pression of MZF-1 aggressively transforms 3T3 cells . ''
These transformed 3T3 cells traverse the cell cycle more rapidly , form foci , form colonies in soft agar , and form tumors in nude mice when compared with control 3T3 cells .
Second , we have localized the 5 end of MZF-1 to within 12 kb of the telomere of human chromosome 19q ( data submitted and available upon request ) .
There is evidence that , in primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells , the telomeres shorten with age . ''
Thus , it is possible that the degeneration of aging telomeres may disrupt MZF-1 , playing a role in the increased incidence of hematopoietic dysfunction seen in the elderly .
This interesting possibility also remains to be investigated .
In summary , MZF-1 has bifunctional transcriptional regulatory properties depending on the cellular environment .
In addition , it appears to regulate the CD34 promoter through specific binding sites .
Based on this , it is possible that MZF1 may have a role in governing the primitive hematopoietic phenotype .
