This Taxl-induced activation of cellular genes is considered to be a critical event in T-cell transformation by HTLV-I .
To elucidate the role of each Tax1l-inducible transcriptional pathway in T-cell transformation , we introduced Tax1l mutants with different trans-activating phenotypes into peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) by retroviral vectors .
Analysis of these PBLs revealed that activation of the NF-xB pathway is sufficient to promote the growth response to IL-2 .
However , for the clonal expansion of CD4+ T-cells , which is a characteristic result of HTLV-I infection , activation of the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways is also required .
Keywords : HTLV-I ; Tax ; CD4 ; CD8 ; NF- « B ; CREB/ ATF Introduction Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiological agent of Adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) , which is characterized by malignant proliferation of CD4+ T-cells , and this virus has the ability to transform normal T-cells in vitro ( Feuer and Chen , 1992 ; Hollsberg and Hafler , 1993 ; Franchini , 1995 ; Hollsberg and Hafler , 1993 ) .
Taxl , a transcriptional trans-activator of this virus , is thought to be responsible for this process ( Franchini , 1995 ; Yoshida , 1993 ) .
Primary human T-cells can be immortalized by Tax1 , and these Tax1-immortalized T-cells exhibited many features similar to those of HTLV-I-transformed T-cells ( Akagi et al. , 1995b ; Akagi and Shimotohno , 1993 ; Grassmann et al. , 1992 ) .
Taxl transcriptionally activates not only its own long terminal repeat ( LTR ) but also many kinds of cellular genes , including the immediate early serum responsive genes ( c-fos , c-jun , egr-1 etc .
) , cytokines and cytokine receptor genes ( IL-2 , IL-6 , GM-CSF , TGF-f1 , IL-2R4 , IL-2Ry etc .
) , and cell adhesion molecule genes ( JCAM-I , OX40 , gp35 , L-selectin etc . )
( Higashimura et al. , 1996 ; Mori et al. , 1994a ; Ohbo et al. , 1995 ; Tatewaki et al. , 1995 ; Yoshida , 1993 ) .
Recently , it has also been suggested that Tax1 can modulate the expression and function of several cell-cycle regulatory genes ( Akagi et al. , 1996 ; Cereseto et al. , 1996 ; Suzuki et al. , 1996 ) .
Correspondence : K Shimotohno Received 22 November 1996 ; revised 15 January 1997 ; accepted 16 January 1997 Previous studies on the mechanisms of Tax1-induced transcriptional activation revealed that Taxl can interact with at least three distinct cellular transcription factors ; CREB/ATF , NF- « xB , and SRF ( Yoshida , 1993 ) .
Through these transcriptional pathways , Taxl activates the expression of a wide variety of cellular genes , and this is thought to mediate T-cell transformation by HTLV-I .
The role of each Taxl-inducible transcriptional pathway in cell transformation has been studied in rodent fibroblasts ( Smith and Greene , 1991 ; Yamaoka et al. , 1996 ) , however it remains completely unknown in T-cells , the natural target of HTLV-I .
To address this issue , we introduced several Taxl mutants with different trans-activating phenotypes into peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) using retroviral vectors , and analysed the phenotypes of these cells .
We demonstrate under these conditions that activation of the NF-xB pathway is sufficient for promoting a growth response to IL-2 , but activation of the CREB/ ATF and SRF pathways are also required for the clonal expansion of CD4+ T-cells which is characteristically observed in PBL following infection with HTLV-I .
Results Trans-activating phenotypes of Tax1 mutants To elucidate the role of each transcriptional pathway activated by Tax1 in T-cell transformation , three Taxl mutants with different trans-activating phenotypes were examined in comparison with wild-type Taxl ( Figure 1A ) .
Mutant 410 has an amino acid substitution at codons 310 and 311 from Glu-Glu to Ala-Ser , which is equivalent to mutant M44 designated by Smith and Greene ( 1990 ) .
Mutant 703 has an amino acid substitution at codons 319 and 320 from Leu-Leu to Arg-Ser , which is equivalent to mutant M47 ( Smith and Greene , 1990 ) .
Mutant M22 has an amino acid substitution at codons 130 and 131 from Thr-Leu to Ser-Ala ( Smith and Greene , 1995 ) .
The Tax1l mutants and wild-type Tax1 were subcloned into the bicistronic retroviral vector LXEN ( Figure 1B ) .
To assess the trans-activating phenotypes , MOLT-4 cells were co-transfected with the plasmid form of each Taxl expression vector and luciferase reporter plasmids ( Figure 1C ) .
The vectors p21x5-Luc , pCArG-Luc , pIL2R-Luc were used as the reporters for the CREB/ ATF pathway , SRF pathway , and NF-xB pathway , respectively .
As expected , wild-type Tax1 activated all the three pathways .
Mutant 410 could not activate any of these pathways , which is consistent with previous results with mutant M44 ( Smith and Greene , 1990 ) .
Mutant 703 activated the NF-xB pathway but failed to activate the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways , which is PBL transduced with HTLV-I Tax mutants T Akagi et al 2072 410 AS 703 mz sa ( B ) LXEN : Bicistronic retroviral vector Sac I Sac I Ecol ?

Two ug of each mutant Taxl cloned in the plasmid form of LXEN were co-transfected with 2 ug of p21x5-Luc ( upper ) , pCArG-Luc ( middle ) , or pNFxBx4-Luc ( lower ) , into MOLT-4 cells and luciferase activities were measured .

Conversely , mutant M22 could not activate the NF-xB pathway but retained the ability to activate the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways .
Introduction of Tax1l mutants into PBL Helper-free retroviral stocks of each mutant and wild-type Taxl were prepared using PG13 packaging cells .
Primary human T-cells derived from PBL were infected with these retroviral vectors and selected with G418 .
The selection efficiencies did not differ significantly between the Taxl-expressing retroviral vectors , and were about 10 % .
As a control , we also prepared cells infected with a backbone vector LXEN .
All the infected PBLs were maintained in medium containing IL-2 .
After one month culture in the selection medium , the expression of Tax1l protein in these PBLs was examined .
The 40 kDa Tax1 protein was detected in all the Taxl-transduced PBL by immunoblot analysis , although levels of expression were somewhat different ( Figure 2a ) .
To confirm that the characteristic trans-activating properties of each Tax1 mutants , which were demonstrated in MOLT-4 cells by transient expression experiments , could also be observed in each retroviral vector infected PBL , the activities of each Tax1-responsive promoter were assayed .
In this experiment , the pNFxBx4-Luc vector which has 4 copies of the NF-xB site was used as a reporter for the NF-xB pathway instead of pIL2R-Luc , to increase the sensitivity .
As shown in Figure 2b , all three pathways were activated in PBL expressing wild-type Tax1 , and none were significantly activated in PBL expressing Tax1 mutant 410 .
In PBL expressing Taxl mutant 703 , only the NF-xB pathway was activated .
And in PBL expressing mutant M22 , the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways , but not the NF-xB pathway , were activated .
Thus the expression of each mutant Taxl with the predicted phenotypes was confirmed in each retroviral vector infected PBL .
Characterization of each Tax1 mutant transduced PBL s The growth properties of the infected PBLs were examined at about 1 month post-infection ( Figure 3 ) .
Each retroviral vector infected PBLs were cultured with relatively low levels of IL-2 ( 10 u/ml ) in the medium , and cell proliferation was assayed by the MTS colorimetric method .
When compared to control vector LXEN infected PBL , PBLs infected with mutant 703 and wild-type Taxl showed markedly higher proliferative responses .
In contrast , PBLs expressing mutant 410 and mutant M22 proliferated at similar or even lower levels than control PBL .
These results clearly show that activation of the NF-xB pathway is critical in promoting the growth response to IL-2 .
At this time point , the cell-surface expression of CD4 , CD8 , and CD25 ( IL-2Ra ) antigens were analysed by flow cytometry ( Figure 4 ) .
In all cases , over 90 % of cells were CD8+ and less than 10 % of cells were CD4+ .
Since the initial surface phenotypes of PBL used for the infection experiment were 30 % CD4+ and 70 % CD8 + ( data not shown ) , CD8 + cells grew preferentially during 1 month culture .
This also happened in uninfected PBL maintained for the same period , and such phenomena have been well documented previously ( Gullberg and Smith , 1986 ) .

( b ) Assay of Taxl-responsive promoter activity .
PBLs infected with each retroviral vector were electroporated with 10 ug of p21x5-Luc ( upper ) , pCArG-Luc ( middle ) , pNFxBx4-Luc { lower ) , or pCMV-Luc , and luciferase activities were measured .
To normalize the difference in the electroporation efficiencies between each PBL , the values are expressed relative to the activity of pCMV-Lue which is not significantly affected by Taxl in PBL ( Akagi et al. , 1991 ) PBL transduced with HTLV-I Tax mutants T Akagi et al - @ - PBLMT -O- PBL/410 -B- PBL/703 - [ _ } - PBL/MM22 MTS ( A 480nm ) Days of culture in IL-2 ( 10 u/mi ) Figure 3 - Growth response to IL-2 of PBLs expressing each Taxl mutant .

Cell proliferations were assayed just prior to , and at 3 and 6 days after the addition of IL-2 by MTS colorimetric method , and were shown as absorbance ( at 490 nm ) values .

PBLs infected with each retroviral vector as well as uninfected PBL maintained in PBL-medium ( 200 u/ml IL-2 ) for about a month were subjected to FACS analysis .
Cytofluorometric profiles of cells stained with anti-CD4 antibody , anti-CD8 antibody , or anti-CD25 antibody are shown .
The vertical axis indicates relative cell numbers , and the horizontal axis indicates relative fluorescence intensities .
We confirmed that the fluorescence intensity of the staining with the negative control antibody , FITC-conjugated normal mouse IgG , was less than 64 in each case - & - PBL/LXEN 2073 PBL transduced with HTLV-I Tax mutants T Akagi et al 2074 PBLs were almost negative .
The existence of these CD25 positive cells probably explain the high responsiveness of these cells to IL-2 .
Taken together , these results indicate that Taxl promotes growth response to IL-2 by inducing CD25 ( IL-2R « ) through the activation of the NF-xB pathway .
Long-term expansion of wild-type and mutant 703 expressing PBLs Wild-type and mutant 703 expressing PBLs grew at a constant , continuous rate , and were easily expanded in medium containing IL-2 over a longer period .
In contrast , the proliferation rates of LXEN , mutant 410 , and mutant M22 expressing PBLs declined gradually , and it became very difficult to expand them even in the presence of IL-2 .
Then , wild-type and mutant 703 expressing PBLs were subjected to long-term observa-tion .
At 4 and 6 months post-infection , cell surface phenotypes were analysed by FACS ( Figure 5 ) .
In wild-type Tax1l expressing PBL , a fraction of CD4+ cells appeared at 4 months post-infection ( about 30 % ) , and became dominant ( over 90 % ) at 6 months post-infection .

Wild-type Taxl expressing PBL ( upper ) and mutant 703 expressing PBL ( lower ) , which were maintained in PBL-medium ( 200 u/ml IL-2 ) , were subjected to FACS analysis at 4 months and 6 months post-infection ( 4 m P.I .
and 6 m P.1 . ) .
Cytofluorometric profiles of cells stained with anti-CD4 antibody , or anti-CD25 antibody , are shown .
The vertical axis indicates relative cell numbers , and the horizontal axis indicates relative fluorescence intensities We confirmed that the fluorescence intensity of the staining with negative control antibody , FITC-conjugated normal mouse IgG , was less than 64 in each case over 90 % of these cells being CD8 + ( data not shown ) .
The number of cells strongly positive for CD25 ( IL2Ra ) expression increased in culture both in the wild-type and mutant 703 expressing PBLs .
Reflecting these augmented expressions of CD25 ( IL-2Ra ) , both PBLs showed vigorous proliferative responses to IL-2 ( data not shown ) .
Clonal expansion of CD4+ cells in wild-type Tax1 expressing PBL To know whether the marked difference in the emergence of CD4+ cells in wild-type and mutant 703 expressing PBLs was observed only in these particular cultures or not , other cultures of both PBLs were investigated ( Table 1 ) .
There were five more cultures of both cell types showing continuous cell growth , which have been divided into separate culture wells just after infection and maintained independently thereafter for more than 8 months .
In four out of five cultures of wild-type Tax1l expressing PBLs , an increase in the proportion of CD4 + cells was evident and the majority of cells ( 70-95 % ) were CD4 positive for at 8 months post-infection .
In contrast , expansion of CD4+ cells was not seen in any of the five cultures of the PBL transduced with mutant 703 even at 8 months post-infection , and over 95 % of all these cultures were confirmed to be CD8+ ( data not shown ) .
The percentage of CD4+ cells in wild-type Taxl expressing PBL once became very low ( at 1 month post-infection ) and then gradually increased , suggesting that clonal expansion of the initially very minor population of CD4+ cells took place during the long-term culture .
To test this possibility , the clonal compositions of these cells were examined by analysing the integration sites of the retroviral vectors by Southern blotting ( Figure 6 ) .
The wild-type Tax1 and mutant 703 expressing PBL at 1 , 4 ( 5 in the case of mutant 703 ) and 6 months post-infection , and other five separately maintained cultures of both cell types were examined .
In both cell types , at 1 month post-infection , the signals were smearing , indicating that Table 1 Percentages of CD4 positive cells in wild-type and mutant 703 expressing PBLs CD4 positive cell rate Well No .

these cultures contained multiple clones .
At 4 or 5 months post-infection , several discrete bands appeared , and only one or two of these bands could be detected at 6 months post-infection .
These results indicated that oligoclonal to nearly monoclonal expansion of particular clones occurred during this culture period .
Such clonal expansions could also be observed in other cultures independently maintained for 5 to 7 months after the infection .
The patterns of bands differed among the cultures , indicating that they consisted of different clones .
Such situations were similar in both cell types .
Thus , the most striking difference was that the expanded clones were CD4+ cells in wild-type expressing PBL , and were CD8 + cells in mutant 703 expressing PBL .
Discussion In the present study , we introduced several Taxl mutants as well as wild-type which differed in trans-activating phenotypes into peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) by retroviral vectors .
The mutants used were M22 which can activate the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways but not the NF-xB pathway , mutant 703 which can activate the NF-xB pathway but fails to activate the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways , and mutant 410 which is defective in all these pathways .
Among these mutants , only the mutant 703 enhanced the growth response to IL-2 as wild-type Taxl did ( Figure 3 ) .
This analysis was conducted at 1 month post-infection when the cells were still mixed populations ( Figure 6 ) with no significant differences in subset composition in each infected PBL .
Therefore , these results represented the general features of each mutant Taxl expressing PBL rather than those of some particular clones .
The responsiveness of mutant 703 expressing PBL was even higher than that of wild-type Taxl expressing PBL , which probably reflects the higher expression level of Taxl protein , the higher activation level of NF-xB pathway , and the higher incidence of CD25 ( IL-2R « ) positive cells in this culture ( Figures 2 and 4 ) .
These results clearly show the importance of the NF-xB pathway , and support the previous notion that Tax1 promotes T-cell growth by inducing CD25 ( IL-2Ra ) through the activation of the NF-xB pathway ( Franchini , 1995 ; Yoshida , 1993 ) .
It was recently reported that Taxl can interact with and inactivate p16 '' , an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 , using domains that overlap with the NF- « xB activation domain ( Suzuki et al. , 1996 ) .
Although we could not detect this complex in our cells , since the expression level of p16 '' is very low in T-cells ( data not shown ) ( Tam et al. , 1994 ) , a part of the positive effect on cell growth by Tax1 may be mediated via this mechanism .
The growth promoting effect of mutant PBL transduced with HTLV-I Tax mutants T Akagi et al 2076 703 was also demonstrated by the fact that only this mutant led to the emergence of continuously growing oligoclonal or monoclonal cell lines after long-term culture in IL-2 containing medium reproducibly , in the same manner as wild-type Taxl .
It is not yet clear whether these cells are fully immortalized or not , but it is clear that the ability in continuing cell growth has been greatly improved in these cells .
By using the same type of Tax1 mutant , the essential role of the activation of the NF-xB pathway in growth promotion was also demonstrated in rat fibroblasts recently ( Yamaoka et al. , 1996 ) .
Interestingly , all the long-term cultures obtained by the introduction of mutant 703 were CD8 + T-cells , while most of those obtained by the introduction of wild-type Tax1 were CD4+ T-cells .
This was not due to the difference in the subset composition of the initially infected cell populations , because there was no significant difference of it between these two cell types at 1 month post-infection .
CD8 + T-cells have a higher responsiveness to IL-2 than CD4+ T-cells intrinsically , and culturing PBL in IL-2 usually results in predominantly CD8 + T-cells ( Asano et al. , 1994 ; Gullberg and Smith , 1986 ) .
Thus , the clonal expansion of CD8 + T-cells in mutant 703 infected PBL probably reflects this higher growth ability of CD8 + T-cells .
The proliferation of CD4+ T-cells is much more strictly regulated than CD8 + T-cells , and the clonal expansion of CD4+ T-cells in PBL culture has only been reported with HTLV-I infection ( Gullberg and Smith , 1986 ) .
Clonal expansion of CD4+ T-cells characteristically occurs following HTLV-I infection of PBL , but the mechanism of this is not clear .
Our results in which expansion of CD4+ T-cells was observed only in wild-type Taxl expressing PBL but not in mutant 703 expression PBL clearly demonstrates that the activation of NF-xB is not sufficient and that activation of CREB/ATF and SRF is also required in this process .
We are currently unable to evaluate the respective roles of the CREB/ATF pathway and the SRF pathway due to a lack of suitable Tax1 mutants .
The mechanism underlying the expansion of CD4+ cells is not clear at present , but Wild-type Tax1l not mutant 703 may activate some positive factor on the growth of CD4+ cells whose effect is not so strong considering the slow time course of CD4+ cell expansion .
Cytokines are supposed to be a candidate for such factor .
Many cytokines have been reported to affect the ratio of CD4+ cells and CD8 + cells when added into PBL culture in combination with IL-2 ( Abe et al. , 1993 ; Lee and Rich , 1993 ; Soldaini et al. , 1992 ; van Bergen et al. , 1996 ; Yang et al. , 1990 ) .
HTLV-I infected T-cells produce a wide variety of cytokines and Tax1 plays a central role in this process ( Franchini , 1995 ; Hollsberg and Hafler , 1993 ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that the differential induction of cytokines between wild-type and mutant 703 may explain the observed expansion of different subsets of T-cells .
Differences in the level of several cytokines in the culture supernatant from wild-type Tax1 expressing PBL and mutant 703 expressing PBL was detected prior to the appearance of significant difference in the CD4+ cell population ( Akagi et al .
unpublished data ) .
In this context , it is worth mentioning that many Tax-inducible cytokine genes have motifs of CRE or AP-1 , which are activated indirectly by SRF , in combination with NF-xB in the promoter region ( Bailly et al. , 1996 ; Curtiss et al. , 1996 ; Himes et al. , 1993 ; Mori and Prager , 1996 ; Mori et al. , 1994b ; Yamashita et al. , 1994 ) .
Full activation of these cytokine gene promoters might only be achieved by wild-type Taxl .
It was recently demonstrated that Tax-responsive elements in the promoters of GM-CSF and IL-2 are activated only by wild-type Taxl but not by M22 nor M47 which corresponds to mutant 703 ( Curtiss et al. , 1996 ; Himes et al. , 1993 ; Good et al. , 1996 ) , and this is in sharp contrast to the promoter of IL-2R « which is efficiently activated by mutant 703 .
Although the expanded T-cell subsets were different , clonal selections of the infected cells occurred both in wild-type and mutant 703 expressing PBLs .
Clonal selections are well-documented in the course of in vitro transformation of T-cells by HTLV-I ( Hahn et a/. , 1984 ; De Rossi et al. , 1985 ) .
However , the basis of this selection process is unclear .
It means that one or few cells continued to grow with a slight growth advantage over other cells , and eventually became dominant after the long culturing period .
This may be caused by the differences in proviral integration site , the expression level of Tax1 protein , or responsiveness to cytokines or so on .
One wild-type transduced PBL culture C-1 , in which we confirmed the expression of Taxl with wild-type phenotype ( data not shown ) , showed no expansion of CD4+ cells In this particular case , the TaxI1-expressing vector might have failed to infect the CD4+ T-cells which were competent for clonal expension .
In rare instances , the establishment of CD8 + T-cell lines has been reported also in the case of HTLV-I infection ( Harper et a/. , 1986 ; Markham et al. , 1984 ) .
In this study , we clearly demonstrate a critical role of NF-xB activation in promoting cell growth and the indispensable role of CREB/ATF and SRF activation in preferential growth of CD4+ cells .
Clonal expansion of CD4+ T-cells by Taxl requires the combination of these pathways .
Identification of the cellular target genes differentially activated by wild-type Taxl and mutant 703 should clarify the precise mechanism of this process .
Materials and methods Plasmid construction Retroviral vector plasmid pLXEN was made from pLXSN ( Miller and Rosman , 1989 ) by replacement of the SV40 promoter with the encephalomyocarditis virus ( EMCV ) 5 nontranslated region containing the internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) obtained from pTM1 ( Moss et a/. , 1990 ) by PCR .
The complete sequence of pLXEN has been submitted to the DDBJ under the accession number D88622 .
Mutants 410 and 703 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type Taxl cDNA cloned in pUC/Taxl ( Akagi et al. , 1991 ) following the methods of Smith and Greene ( 1990 ) .
Mutant 410 was made to have an amino acid substitution at codons 310 and 311 from Glu-Glu to Ala-Ser , and mutant 703 had an amino acid substitution at codons 319 and 320 from Leu-Leu to Arg-Ser .
Mutations were confirmed by sequencing .
Mutant M22 ( Smith and Greene , 1995 ) was kindly provided by Dr WC Greene .
Each mutant Tax , as well as wild-type Tax , were subcloned into the Hpal-EcoRI site of pLXEN by attaching appropriate linkers at both ends .
p21x5-Luc was constructed by inserting the Nrul-HindIII fragment from pRAU3.21x5-CAT ( Shimotohno et al. , 1986 ) which contains 5 copies of Tax-responsive 21 bp repeat into the SmaI-HindIII site of the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid PGV-B2 ( Toyo Ink ) .
pCArG-Lue was constructed by inserting the Xbal-NdelI fragment from pCArG-CAT ( Fujii et al. , 1992 ) which contains a CArG box derived from c-fos into the BglII-Sacl site of PGV-B2 by attaching appropriate linkers at both ends .
pIL2R-Luc was constructed by inserting the HindIII-Sacl fragment from pRPXRCAT ( Maruyama et al. , 1987 ) which has an NF-xB site derived from human IL-2R & « chain gene into the HindIII-Sacl site of PGV-B2 .
pNFxBx4-Luc was constructed by inserting the Nrul-HindIII fragment from pNFxBx4-CAT , which has 4 copies of an NF-xB site from the murine Ig x gene in Smal site of pRAU3-CAT ( Shimotohno et al. , 1986 ) , into the SmaI-HindIII site of PGV-B2 .
pCMV-Luc was constructed by inserting the Xbal-HindIII fragment from pCMV-CAT ( Akagi et al. , 1991 ) containing the human cytomegalovirus immediate early region promoter into the Smal-HindIII site of PGV-B2 after end filling the Xbal site .
Cells and cell culture The MOLT-4 ( Cheng and Haas , 1990 ) , human T-cell line , was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
The retrovirus packaging cell line PG13 ( Miller et al. , 1991 ) , based on the gibbon ape leukemia virus , was maintained in Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle 's Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 5 % FCS .
Primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) were prepared from whole fresh blood .
Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque , and suspended in the PBL medium : AIM-V medium ( GIBCO ) supplemented with 2 % FCS , recombinant IL-2 at 200 u/ml , and 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol , and stimulated with 1 % phytohemagglu-tinin ( PHA ) for 3 days .
Then non-adherent cells were harvested , and maintained in the PBL medium for about a week .
The surface phenotypes of these cells were as follows : CD3 + , 97 % ; CD4 + , 30 % ; and CD8 + , 70 % .
Retroviral infection of PBL s Each retroviral vector plasmids was introduced into the PG13 packaging cell line as described previously ( Akagi et al. , 1991 ) .
PBL , stimulated with PHA and expanded in IL-2 , were infected with retroviral vectors by incubation with culture supernatants from the PG13 cells , that had been filtered through a 0.45 um filter , for 3 h in the presence of polybrene ( 8 ug/ml ) .
Two days after the infection , infected cells were split into multi well culture dishes and selected for resistance to 0.8 mg/ml of G418 in the PBL medium .
The titers of the retroviral stocks did not differ significantly between each Taxl mutant , and was in the range that approximately one tenth of PBLs could be infected .
All the infected PBLs were maintained in the PBL medium .
Luciferase assay Luciferase reporter plasmids were introduced into T-cells by electroporation as described previously ( Akagi and Shimotohno , 1993 ) .
One day after electroporation , cells were harvested and luciferase activities were measured with References Abe Y , Van Eden M , Gatanaga M , Wang FI , Brightbill HD , Granger GA and Gatanaga T. ( 1993 ) .

PBL transduced with HTLV-I Tax mutants T Akagi et al the PicaGene luciferase assay system ( Toyo Ink ) as directed by the manufacturer .
Southern blot analysis Genomic DNA ( 10 ug ) was digested with restriction endonucleases , separated by electrophoresis in 0.8 % agarose , and blotted onto a nylon membrane ( Hybond-N , Amersham ) .
The membrane was hybridized with P-labeled neo-specific probe ( a 1.3 kb HindIII-Smal fragment from pZIPneoSV ( X ) I ) as described previously ( Akagi et al. , 1991 ) .
Then , membranes were washed in 0.2 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 65°C for 1 h and exposed to X-ray films with intensifying screens at -70°C .
Immunoblotting Immunoblotting was performed essentially as described previously ( Akagi et al. , 1995a ) .
Briefly , 5 x 10° cells were pelleted and lysed in 100 ul of 2x SDS-PAGE sample buffer .
Ten microliters of each sample was fractionated by 10 % SDS-PAGE , and the proteins were electrophoreti-cally transferred to Immobilon ( Millipore ) .
After blocking with 5 % nonfat dried milk in TBST ( 10 mm Tris-HCI , pH 7.4 , 140 mm NaCl , 0.1 % Tween 20 ) overnight at room temperature , the membranes were incubated with anti-Taxl monoclonal antibody , TAXYT7 ( Tanaka et al. , 1991 ) , in TBST for 1 h. They were then washed extensively with TBST , incubated for 1h at room temperature with secondary antibodies , washed and developed with the Amersham ECL chemiluminescence reagent as directed by the manufacturer .
Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD3 ( Leud ) , CD4 ( Leu3a ) , CD8 ( Leu2a ) , and CD25 ( IL-2R1 ) were used to detect the cell-surface markers .
Cells were allowed to react with optimal concentrations of these antibodies , and were analysed by flow cytometer , Cytoron-Absolute ( Ortho ) .
Cell proliferation assay Cells maintained in PBL medium ( 200 u/ml IL-2 ) were suspended in AIM-V medium containing 2 % FCS , and cultured in flat bottom 96 well plates ( 2 x 10° cells per well ) for 24 h. Then IL-2 was added to each well at 10 u/ml .
Cell proliferation was assayed just prior to , and at 3 and 6 days after the addition of IL-2 by MTS colorimetric method using CellTiter96 '' '' AQueous assay kit ( Promega ) .
