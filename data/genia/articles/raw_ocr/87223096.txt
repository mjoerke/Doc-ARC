Koeffler Department of Medicine , Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of California Los Angeles Medical Center , Los Angeles , California 90024 ; and *Department of Biochemistry , University of California , Riverside , California 92521 Abstract We show that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 1,25 [ OH } ; D ; ) , the most hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D ; , modulates sensitively and specifically both the protein and messenger RNA accumulation of the multilineage growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) .
The regulation of GM-CSF expression is seen in both normal human mitogen-activated T lymphocytes and T lymphocytes from a line ( S-LB1 ) transformed with human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 ( HTLV-1 ) .
In contrast , cells from a HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocyte line ( Ab-VDR ) established from a patient with vitamin D-resistant rickets type II with undetectable 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; cellular receptors are resistant to the action of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Inhibition of GM-CSF expression by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can occur independently of interleukin 2 regulation and is probably mediated through cellular 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors .
We conclude that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; may be important in the physiology of hematopoiesis .
Introduction Evidence is accumulating that the hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D ; , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 1,25 [ OH ] ; D ; ) , ' might play an important role as an immunohematopoietic regulatory hormone ( reviewed in references 1 , 2 ) .
Specific 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors are present in normal human mitogen-activated and malignant T and B lymphocytes and myeloid cells ( 3 , 4 ) .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; enhances the in vitro differentiation of normal and leukemic myeloid stem cells towards macrophages ( 5-7 ) .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibits proliferation and suppresses interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) synthesis of mitogen-activated T lymphocytes ( 8-11 ) .
Hunian macrophages activated by y-interferon synthesize 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 12 , 13 ) .

The granulocyte-macrophage CSF ( GM-CSF ) , which is synthesized by activated T lymphocytes , has been cloned ( 14 , 15 ) .
Recombinant and natural GM-CSF possess multilineage colony-stimulating activity ( 16 , 17 ) and also enhances mature cell function of neutrophils and eosinophils ( 18 , 19 ) .
We report here that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; sensitively and specifically inhibits the expression of GM-CSF in T lymphocytes .
Methods Compounds .
The vitamin D , metabolites ( 1,25 [ OH ] ; D ; , 1,24,25- [ OH ] ; D ; , and 25 [ OH ] JD ; ) were a generous gift from Dr. M. Uskokovic , Hoffmann-La Roche , Inc. , Nutley , NJ .
The compounds were dissolved in 100 % ethanol to a stock concentration of 1 X 107 M and stored at -20°C .
The various concentrations ( 10~ '' -10~ ' M ) were obtained by diluting the stock solutions in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
The concentration of ethanol did not exceed 0.1 % .

Phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( Wellcome Diagnostics , Datford , England ) was used in a final concentration of 0.5 % .
Cells and liquid culture assay .
The human cell lines S-LB1 ( 20 ) , Ab-VDR ( H. P. Koeffier and A. W. Norman , unpublished observations ) , HL-60 ( 21 ) , and KG-1 ( 22 ) were maintained in suspension culture T flask ( Miles Laboratories Inc. , Naperville , IL ) , containing alpha medium ( Flow Laboratories , Inc. , Rockville , MD ) and 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( Irvine Scientific , Santa Ana , CA ) in a humidified atmosphere of 7 % CO ; .
The medium was changed two times a week .
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) and human bone marrow cells were obtained from normal volunteers and isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient ( 1.077 g/m ! )
( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) .
Monocytes were removed from PBL by their ability to adhere to plastic for 6 h. The PBL and the human HTLV-i immortalized T lymphocyte cell lines ( S-LB1 , Ab-VDR ) were cultured for 2 d at 1 X 10° cells/ml in alpha medium-supplemented with 10 % FCS in the presence of the various additives ( vitamin D ; , compounds , PHA , IL-2 ) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 7 % CO ; .
The conditioned media ( CM ) were stored at 4°C .
Cell viability was not affected in the various experimental protocols , as determined by trypan blue exclusion .

Complementary DNA ( cDNA ) probes , Northern blot technique .
The IL-2 cDNA was a generous gift from S. Clarke , Genetics Institute , Boston , MA ( 24 ) .
The IL-2 receptor cDNA was kindly provided by T. Nikaido ( 25 ) .
The IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor probes were [ **P ] -labeled by the A. Tobler , J. Gasson , H. Reichel , A. W. Norman , and H. P. Koeffler random priming method as described ( 26 ) .
The GM-CSF probes were [ *P ] -labeled by nick translation ( 27 ) .
For cytoplasmic RNA , freshly harvested cells were suspended in hy-potonic buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.4 ] , 1 mM KCI , 3 mM MgCl ; ) and were lysed with Nonidet P-40 ( 0.3 % ) .
Nuclei were removed by cen-trifugation .
Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted by the phenol/chlorofom method as essentially described ( 28 ) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm .
Samples were denatured at 65°C for 10 min , size-separated by an agarose formaldehyde gel ( 1 % agarose [ Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ] , 50 mM Na acetate , 10 mM Na ; EDTA , 200 mM MOPS , and 2.2 M formaldehyde ) , and transferred to a nylon membrane filter ( ICN Biomedicals Inc. , Irvine , CA ) .
Filters were dried , baked at 80°C in vacuo for 2 h , and then prehybridized for 16-24 h. Hybrid-izations with [ **P ] -labeled cDNA ( 1 X 10° cpm/ml ! )
were performed at 42°C for 16-24 h in a solution containing 50 % ( vol/vol ) formamide , 2 % SSC ( 1 % SSC is 150 mM NaCl , 15 mM sodium citrate ) , 5 % Denhardts ( 1 % Denhardts is 0.02 % Ficoll/0.02 % polyvinylpyrrolidone/0.02 % bovine serum albumin ) , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % { vol/vol ) dextran sulfate ( 500,000 mol wt ) ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) , and 100 ug/ml salmon sperm DNA ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) .
Filters were washed to a stringency of 0.1 % SSC , 1 % SDS at 65°C and exposed for 24-48 h at -70°C to XAR-5 film ( Eastman Kodak Co. , Rochester , NY ) .
Measurement of incorporation .
S-LBI cells ( 1 % 10°/ ml ) were exposed in 24-well plates ( Miles Laboratories Inc. ) in quadruplicates for various durations ( 0 , 6 , 48 h ) to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; M ) .
Cells were pulsed with 0.5 of [ `` *Cjuridine ( New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) for 2 h at 37°C , washed twice in PBS , precipitated in 5 % trichlo-roacetic acid ( TCA ) for 10 min , washed twice in 5 % TCA , and heated at 80°C for 60 min .
200 u ] of each sample was counted by liquid scintillation .

After 48 h , cells were pulsed with 1 LCi of [ H ] thymidine ( ICN Biomedicals Inc. ) for 5 h at 37°C and harvested into glass filter fiber with a Mash II cell harvester ( Skatron , Inc. , Sterling , VA ) and counted by liquid scintillation .
Results Modulation of GM-CSF protein levels by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and influence of IL-2 on GM-CSF expression in peripheral blood lym-phocytes : dose response .
The PBL ( 1 X 10°/ml ) were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 107 '' '-10~ '' M ) and PHA ( 0.5 % ) .
After 2 d , CSF activity of the CM was assayed for stimulation of clonal growth of both normal human granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells ( GM-CFC ) and the human myeloblastic leukemic cell line KG-1 ( Fig .
1 A ) .
Clonal growth of both GM-CFC and KG-1 cells is dependent on CSF ( 22 ) .
We found that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased levels of GM-CSF protein in a dose-dependent fashion with a 50 % reduction of CSF activity ( EDs , ) at ~ 5 X 10~'° M 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; when tested on clonal growth of GM-CFC and KG-1 cells .
Control dishes containing no 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; formed 127+8 ( +SD ) GM-CFC and 62+10 ( +SD ) KG-1 colonies .
No difference in colony formation could be observed when 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~* M ) was added directly to the culture dishes containing CM of PHA-activated PBL compared with the control dishes containing CM of PHA-stimulated PBL only .
Prior studies showed that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased proliferation and IL-2 synthesis by PBL ( 8-11 ) .
We examined , therefore , whether IL-2 might affect the modulation of GM-CSF production by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in lymphocytes ( Fig .
1 4 ) .

Dose-response studies ( 4-C ) : ( 4 ) Regulation of GM-CSF protein production .
PBL were cultured for 48 h in the presence of PHA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
GM-CSF activity of the CM was tested by measuring clonal growth of both a normal human GM-CFC ( 0 ) and a leukemic myeloblastic cell line KG-1 ( @ ) .
In a parellel series of experiments , recombinant IL-2 ( 200 ng/ml ) was added to the cultures and the CM was assayed on GM-CFC ( e ) .
The IL-2 alone had no effect on clonal growth , ( B and C ) Regulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels ( Northern blots ) .
PBL were incubated for 48 hours with PHA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
When probed with GM-CSF cDNA , a single band was detected at 0.9 kb consistent with the known length of GM-CSF mRNA ( B ) .
The same Northern blot was reprobed with IL-2 receptor cDNA , as a control ( C ) .
Two bands were observed at 1.4 and 3.5 kb consistent with IL-2 receptor mRNA .
Time-response studies ( D and £ ) : ( D ) Regulation of GM-CSF protein production .
PBL were exposed to PHA and for various durations ( 12-48 h ) to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 1078 M ) .
All time points were harvested after 48 h. GM-CSF activity was assayed on GM-CFC .
( E ) Regulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels ( Northern blot ) .
PHA-activated PBL were cultured for various durations ( 6-48 h ) with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ ' M ) .
PBL at all time points were harvested after 48 h. Each experiment in A and D represents the mean+SD from three independent experiments with PBL from three different donors .
RNA was extracted as described in Methods .
Each lane in B , C , and E contains 30 ug cytoplasmic RNA .
Results are expressed as a percent reduction of mRNA accumulation by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; as compared with the untreated control sample not exposed to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( determined by densitometry on different exposures of preflashed autoradiograms ) .
( 10- '' '-10~ '' M ) and PHA ( 0.5 % ) ; the CM was assayed for stimulation of GM-CFC .
We found that the addition of IL-2 to the cultures slightly blunted but did not reverse the inhibitory action of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on GM-CSF protein activity .
The IL-2 alone Colony-stimulating Factor Regulation by 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D ; 1701 had no effect on clonal growth of GM-CFC .
CM from control cultures ( PHA 0.5 % , no IL-2 , no 1,25 [ OH ] ; D ; ) stimulated a mean 243+8 ( +SD ) GM-CFC per 2 X 10° mononuclear bone marrow cells .
Modulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in PBL : dose response .
The modulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels of PBL cultured with various concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was determined by Northern blot analysis ( Fig .
1 B ) .
The PBL were pooled from seven different donors , exposed for 2 d to increasing concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ '' -10~® M ) and PHA ( 0.5 % ) and the mRNA was extracted .
A single band of hybridization was detected at 0.9 kb , which is consistent with GM-CSF mRNA ( 14 , 15 ) .
The 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; reduced mRNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with an EDs , of ~ 5 X 107 '' M as determined by densitometry reading .
The same Northern blot was washed and reprobed with a human cDNA for the IL-2 receptor gene to exclude a nonspecific degradation of mRNA ( Fig .
1 C ) .
Two classes of IL-2 receptor mRNA could be observed at 1.4 and 3.5 kb , which is in accordance with previously reported data ( 25 ) .
No significant change of IL-2 receptor mRNA ( 1.4-kb band ) could be detected .
Modulation of GM-CSF protein and mRNA levels by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in PBL : time response .
We examined whether 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; might be able to down-regulate protein and mRNA levels of GM-CSF in PBL already activated by PHA ( Fig .
1 , D and E ) .
For all time points , the PBL were exposed for 48 h to PHA ( 0.5 % ) .
The 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 107° M ) was added to the cultures at times 0 , 24 , 36 h for the protein studies , and 0 , 24 , 42 h for the mRNA studies .
Control samples were stimulated by PHA alone .
We found that a 12-h exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibited GM-CSF protein production by ~ 50 % in PBL previously activated with PHA for 36 h ( Fig .
1 D ) ; and a 6-h exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was sufficient to reduce mRNA levels of GM-CSF by ~ 50 % in PBL previously activated for 42 h ( Fig .
1 E ) .
___ Regulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in a HTLV-1 immortalized T lymphocyte line ( S-LB1 ) .
We performed a parallel series of experiments using a human T lymphocyte line ( S-LB1 ) established by infection of normal human T lymphocytes with HTLV-1 ( 20 ) .
These cells constitutively synthesize GM-CSF and express high levels of IL-2 receptors ( 29 , 30 ) .
S-LBI cells were exposed for 48 h to increasing concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ '' -10~ ' M ) ( Figs .
2 4 ) .
The 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , decreased GM-CSF mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion as shown on the Northern blot , and a 50 % reduction of mRNA occurred at ~ 2.5 X 10~ '' M. Time-response experiments showed that a 50 % decrease of GM-CSF mRNA accumulation occurred within 6 h of exposure of S-LB1 cells to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D , ; ( 107° M ) ( Fig .
2 B ) .
For control purpose , the same samples were reprobed with IL-2 receptor cDNA ( Fig .
2 C ) .
Only a slight change of the IL-2 receptor mRNA levels ( 1.4-kb band ) could be detected when S-LBI1 cells were exposed to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 107° M ) , as compared to the marked decrease of GM-CSF mRNA levels .
Receptor-mediated modulation of GM-CSF expression by vitamin D ; seco-steroids .
We first studied the ability of other metabolites of vitamin D ; to regulate the accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA by S-LB1 cells ( Fig .
3 4 ) .
The S-LBI1 cells were cultured for 48 h with différent vitamin D ; metabolites ( 10~ M ) .
The rank order of potency ( 1,25 [ ( OH ] ; D ; > 1,24,25 [ OH ] ; D ; > 25 [ OH ] JD ; ) of the metabolites to affect accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA paralleled the affinity of the metabolites to bind to the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; cellular receptors in other tissues ( 31 ) .

S-LB1 cells were exposed for 48 h to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Analysis was performed by Northern blot technique with 30 ug cytoplasmic RNA per lane .
( B and C ) Time-course experiments ( Northern blot ) .
S-LB1 cells were cultured for various durations ( 0.5-48 h ) with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~® M ) .
Each lane contains 20 ug RNA .
As a control , the same samples were reprobed with IL-2 receptor cDNA ( C ) .
Two bands were observed at 1.4 and 3.5 kb consistent with IL-2 receptor mRNA .
Analysis was performed as described in Fig .
1 .
A single band at 0.9 kb ( 4 and C ) was detected when probed with GM-CSF cDNA .
we established a HTLV-1 immortalized T lymphocyte cell line derived from a patient with vitamin D-resistant rickets type II ( Ab-VDR ) .
Vitamin D-resistant rickets II is a heterogenous group of syndromes characterized by a decreased or absent ability of 1,2 5 ( OH ) ; D ; to bind to its cellular receptor ( 1 , 32 ) .
Exposure of the Ab-VDR cells to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ ' M , 10~'° M ) for 48 h had little effect on GM-CSF mRNA accumulation ( reduction of mRNA of ~ 15 % compared with control samples , as determined by densitometry ) ( Fig .
3 B ) .
These results are consistent with Ab-VDR cells having undetectable 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; cellular receptors , as determined by sucrose density gradient and DNA chromatography analyses ( H. P. Koeffler and A. W. Norman , unpublished observations ) .
Influence of IL-2 on the expression of GM-CSF by S-LBI cells .
Previous studies suggested that most HTLV-1-transformed T lymphocytes do not synthesize IL-2 ( 33 ) .
We probed S-LBI mRNA with a human cDNA for IL-2 ( Fig .
3 C ) .
The PHA-stimulated PBL were used as a positive control and the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 as a negative control .
A single band could be detected at 0.9 kb in PHA-activated lymphocytes consistent with IL-2 mRNA ( 24 ) .
However , no IL-2 mRNA could be detected in S-LB1 cells and yet cells from the same passage were regulated very sensitively by 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; ( Fig .
2 4 ) .
Total RNA synthesis by S-LBI1 cells in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( [ `` *Curidine incorporation } .
To further examine whether 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; influences total RNA synthesis in lymphocytes , we exposed S-LBI cells ( 1 X for 0 , 6 and 24 h to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 107 M ) and measured [ '*Cjuridine incorporation into TCA precipitable counts ( Table I ) .

We measured the effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ ' M ) on PHA-activated PBL by measuring [ °HJthymidine incorporation .
After 48 h in culture , PHA-activated PBL incorporated 11,911+4,446 cpm/ 10® cells .
Treatment with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ ' M ) for 48 h resulted in a statistically insignificant ( P > 0.5 ) decrease of incorporation into PBL ( 8,728+2,097 cpm/10® cells ) , representing a 16.7 % inhibition as compared with the control samples not treated with 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; .
The results represent the mean+SD for nine incubations .
Discussion We report in the present in vitro study that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , the most active metabolite of vitamin D ; , is a potent inhibitor of the expression of the hematopoietic growth factor GM-CSF in PHA-activated normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) .
The 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; regulated both protein and mRNA accumulation of GM-CSF ; and this down-regulation occurred at concentrations close to those in vivo ( Fig .
1 ) .
The recent reports that activated macrophages synthesize 1,25 ( OH ) D ; , ( 12 , 13 ) further indicate that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; might interact with GM-CSF production at a local level .
Our time-response studies indicate that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can influence GM-CSF expression by PBL also in later stages of mitogenesis ( Fig .
1 E ) .
The concentrations of 1,2 5 ( OH ) ; D ; achieving half-maximal response ( EDs , ) were 5 xX 107 '' M and 5 X 10~ '' ° M for GM-CSF mRNA levels and GM-CSF protein activity , respectively .
These differences in the EDs , can be explained by the greater sensitivity and specificity of the RNA blot technique compared with the clonogenic assay in soft agar .
In the clonogenic assay , CM from PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was used which , besides GM-CSF , also contains an admixture of other growth factors , including interleukin 3 and other lymphokines .
These additional factors may have decreased both the sensitivity and specificity of the clonogenic assay .
Similar to PBL , the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; sensitively inhibited mRNA accumulation of GM-CSF by the HTLV-1 immortalized T lymphocytes ( S-LB1 ) derived from a normal individual ( 19 ) ( Fig .
2 4 ) .
The 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; did not markedly affect mRNA levels for the IL-2 receptor in either the PHA-activated PBL or S-LBI1 cells which constitutively produce high levels of IL-2 receptors ( Figs .
1 C , 2 C ) .
This suggests that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; does not non-specifically decrease levels of mRNA in lymphocytes .
The 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibited total cellular RNA synthesis in S-LBI1 cells as determined by incorporation of { ' '' CJuridine into TCA precipitable counts ( Table 1 ) .
This inhibition of total RNA , however , was much less pronounced and less rapid as compared with the decrease in GM-CSF mRNA in the same cells ( 4 and 52 % inhibition , respectively , after exposure for 6h to 1,25 [ OH ] ; D ; [ Fig .
2 B , Table I ] ) .
Several recent reports suggested that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , may be capable of immunoregulation similar to the glucocorticoids .
Tsoukas et al .
showed that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibited the lymphocyte growth-promoting factor IL-2 by PBL ( 10 ) .
Studies using different vitamin D ; metabolites suggested that the effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was probably mediated by a specific receptor .
Likewise , Rigby et al .
demonstrated that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was a potent inhibitor of PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation , achieving a 70 % inhibition of incorporation after 72 h in culture ( 9 ) .
Another study also showed that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; 1703 inhibited the proliferation and IL-2 protein production by helper T lymphocytes ( 8 ) .
Similarly , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased the antigen-induced proliferation and IL-2 protein synthesis by cloned Ta-restricted T cell hybridomas after 24 h in culture ( 11 ) .
Taken together , these studies revealed a possible immunoregulatory role for 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; that has not previously been appreciated .
The 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors are not present in resting T lymphocytes , but do appear 24 h after mitogenic stimulation ( 4 ) .
The HTLV-1-immortalized T-cell lines constitutively express 1,25 ( OH ) D ; receptors .
Our experiments using different vitamin D ; metabolites suggest that the inhibition of the GM-CSF expression by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is most likely mediated through specific cellular receptors ( Fig .
3 A ) .
The potency of these compounds to reduce mRNA levels of GM-CSF paralleled their known affinity to bind to the specific cellular receptor in other tissues ( 31 ) .
Furthermore , our results are in accordance with the reported dissociation constant of 3.8 X 10~'° M for 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; by PHA-activated PBL ( 3 ) .
A more direct evidence for this assumption of a receptor-mediated mechanism relies on our study using a HTLV-1-immortalized T lymphocyte line ( Ab-VDR ) that was derived from a patient with vitamin D-resistant rickets type II .
Exposure of Ab-VDR cells to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; resulted in only a small decrease of GM-CSF mRNA levels compared with the marked decrease in S-LB1 cells ( Fig .
3 B ) .
These results are consistent with our observation that Ab-VDR cells have undetectable 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors , whereas the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; -sen-sitive S-LBI1 cells display 13 fmol 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors/10® cells , as determined by sucrose density gradient and DNA chromatography analyses ( H. P. Koeffler and A. W. Norman , unpublished observations ) .
The fact that Ab-VDR cells responded at all to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; suggests that either these cells have a low number of receptors not detectable by the present techniques or very high concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can affect all cells independent of expression of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors .
Studies are currently under way to analyze the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors in these cells by using a specific cDNA probe for this hormone receptor .
Koren et al .
recently reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with vitamin D-resistant rickets type II do not express 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptors , even after mitogenic stimulation ( 32 ) .
Moreover , proliferation of these lymphocytes could not be inhibited after a 72-h exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , in contrast to the normal cells .
Because prior studies showed that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibited the production of IL-2 ( 9 , 10 , 34 ) , we questioned whether 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; might mediate its inhibitory effect on the expression of GM-CSF indirectly through a down-regulation of IL-2 production .
Addition of very high concentrations of IL-2 ( 200 ng/ ml ) slightly abrogated but did not reverse the inhibition of GM-CSF protein production by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in PBL ( Fig .
1 4 ) .
Furthermore , we observed that S-LB1 cells did not express IL-2 mRNA ( Fig .
3 C ) .
This T-cell line , therefore , provided an unusual tool to study our assumption of a possible IL-2-indepen-dent regulation of GM-CSF expression by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Our dose-response and time-course experiments clearly showed that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; sensitively inhibited GM-CSF mRNA levels by S-LBI cells in an IL-2-free system ( Fig .
2 , 4 and B ) .
Taken together , our experiments suggest that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can regulate independently of IL-2 the expression of a lymphokine in transformed T lymphocytes .
The effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on normal human PBL seems to be mostly but not totally independent from IL-2 .
Our study using [ °HJthymidine showed no significant inhibition of the proliferation of PHA-activated lymphocytes by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Other investigators , however , found a marked inhibition of the lymphocyte proliferation by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , as mentioned above ( 8 , 9 , 11 ) .
This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the PBL in the other experiments were cultured for 72 h in the presence of PHA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , whereas in our study , [ } H ] thymidine incorporation was determined at 48 h of culture .
Our results suggest that the inhibition of GM-CSF production by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is not necessarily linked to its reported antiproliferative properties .
How does 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; regulate the expression of GM-CSF ?
In the case of glucocorticoids , studies showed that mouse mammary tumor virus DNA contains regions to which the glucocorticoid-receptor complex can specifically bind .
Transcription is directly stimulated by interaction of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex with DNA sequences adjacent to the promoter ( reviewed in reference 35 ) .
In a parallel fashion to the glucocorticoids , the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor complex might specifically bind to certain regions of DNA and inhibit the transcription of the GM-CSF gene either directly or via a transacting mechanism .
Vanice et al. , however , recently reported that dexamethasone regulated the expression of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein at the posttranscriptional level ( 36 ) .
Preliminary experiments by us using in vitro nuclear run-on assays suggest that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; affects the stability of GM-CSF mRNA .
In summary , our study shows that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibits sensitively the expression of GM-CSF by PBL and a HTLV-1 immortalized T lymphocyte line at the mRNA level .
This down-regulation is mediated by a specific 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor and can further occur independently of IL-2 .
We conclude that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , might be important as a regulatory hormone in hematopoiesis .
