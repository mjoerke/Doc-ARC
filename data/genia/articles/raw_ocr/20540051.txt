E-mail address : srosenbe @ umbc.edu Copyright © 2000 by The American Association of Immunologists early studies with STAT6 knockout ( STAT6 `` ~ ) '' mice supported the hypothesis that STAT6 '~ mice were completely deficient in Th2 production ( 4-7 ) .
However , more recent studies indicate there is an alternative pathway for differentiation of Th2 cells that is independent of STAT6 ( 8-11 ) .
Despite this alternative pathway , CD4* T cell differentiation in STAT6 '~ mice defaults to a Th1-like response and a deficiency of functional Th2 cells ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) .
STAT4 was originally thought to be critical for development of Th1 cells ( 14 ) because it is a transcriptional regulatory molecule for IL-12 , which is a potent differentiation agent for Th1 cells ( 15 ) .
However , recent studies demonstrate there are both STAT4-dependent and STAT4-independent pathways for the development of Th1 cells .
The STAT4-dependent pathway involves induction of IL-12 , while the STAT4-independent pathway does not involve IL-12 and is a default pathway that occurs in the absence of STAT6 signaling ( 16 ) .
Even though STAT4 knockout ( STAT4 ~~ ) mice contain an alternative pathway for generating Th1 cells , the CD4* T cell response in these mice is strongly skewed toward a Th2 response , and STAT4 '~ mice are deficient for Th1 cells .
Th1 cells are generally considered to provide `` help '' to CD8 * T cells , whereas Th2 cells provide `` help '' to Ab-producing B cells ( 17 ) .
This paradigm has been extended to tumor immunity , and investigators have proposed that Th1 cells are the desired CD4 * population because they facilitate differentiation of tumor-specific CD8 * T cells ( 18 , 19 ) , which are potent anti-tumor effectors ( 20 ) .
Although the correlation between STATA4~'~ and STAT6 '~ mice and deficiencies in Th1 and Th2 cells , respectively , is not absolute , we speculated that these mice might provide useful information on the roles of Th1 and Th2 cells in anti-tumor immunity .
We challenged BALB/c STAT4 '~ and STAT6 '~ mice in the mammary gland with the highly malignant , nonimmunogenic , and metastatic BALB/c-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma ( 21-23 ) .
Our expectation was that STAT6 '~ mice would have enhanced anti-tumor immunity because differentiation of CD4*~ T cells would be skewed toward a Th1 response and that STAT4 '~ mice would have reduced anti-tumor immunity because they are deficient for Th1 cells .
We observed that the 4T 1 tumor grows and metastasizes less in STAT6 '~ mice , suggesting that deletion of the STAT6 gene enhances anti-tumor immunity .

Materials and Methods Mice and tumor challenges BALB/c STAT6 '~ ( 5 ) and STAT4~'~ ( 14 ) mice were bred in the University of Maryland Baltimore County ( UMBC ) Biology Department animal facility .
These mice were generated by targeted disruption of the STAT6 and STAT4 genes , respectively , in 129 strain mice .
Offspring were backcrossed for 10 generations to BALB/c mice .
STAT6 '~ and STAT4~'~ mice have no detectable STAT6 or STAT4 protein , respectively .
BALB/c mice were either purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) , and/or bred at UMBC and maintained in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory animals .
Mice were challenged in the abdominal mammary gland with 7 X 10° wild-type 4T1 tumor cells .
Primary tumors at the site of injection were measured using an electronic calipers and tumor diameters calculated as the square root of the length X width of the tumor as previously described ( 24 ) .
Number of clonogenic lung metastases was determined by plating dissociated lung cells in medium supplemented with 6-TG , as previously described ( 24 ) .
Data presented are representative of three independent primary tumor challenge experiments and two independent metastasis experiments .
Immunofluorescence Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described ( 24 ) .
To determine percent CD4* and CD8* T cells in naive and immunized STAT4-~'~ , STAT6 '~ , and BALB/c mice , splenocytes were double labeled for CD3 plus CD4 or CD3 plus CD8 .
Mice were immunized using the identical schedule and number of immunizations as the donors for effectors in the CTL assays ; however , the cells were not from the same animals used in the CTL assays .
Reported values for percent CD4* and CD8 * T cells are averages from at least five animals per group .
CD4* and CD8¢ T cell depletions Mice were in vivo depleted for CD4 * or CD8 * T cells using mAbs to CD4 ( GK 1.5 ; Ref .
25 ) or CD8 ( 2.43 ; Ref .
26 ) on days -6 , -3 , and -1 , and one to two times a week thereafter , where day 0 is the day of tumor challenge , as previously described ( 22 ) .
All mice were checked by indirect immunofluorescence at the end of the experiment ( day 42 ) for completeness of depletions .
In the experiments shown in Figs .
2 and 3 , CD4 and CD8 levels in depleted mice were < 1 % , except for one of the CD4-depleted mice which had 8 % CD4* T cells .
For CTL assays , immunized donors were depleted for CD4* or CD8* T cells using mAbs to CD4 ( GK1.5 ) or CD8 ( 2.43 ) before the last immunization using the same schedule as above , where day 0 is the day of the final immunization and spleens were removed on day 5 .
Data presented are representative of two independent experiments .
CTL assays CTL assays were performed as previously described ( 27 ) with the following modifications .
Target cells ( 4T1 and melF10 ) were labeled at up to 10 '' cells/500 ul FCS with 100 C *'Cr ( NEN , Boston , MA ) for 1.5 h at 37°C .
Labeled cells were washed with excess PBS , incubated an additional 30 min at 37°C , and used at 5 X 10° cells per well .
For the CTL experiment of Fig .
4 , splenic effector cells were obtained from mice that were immunized six times with 5000 rad irradiated 5 X 10° 4T1/AYCD80 ( 24 ) plus 5 X 10° 4TI/SEB ( 23 ) cells .
The first immunization was performed on day 1 , and subsequent immunizations on days 16 , 28 , 35 , 49 , and 62 ( approx-imately every 2 wk ) .
Spleens were removed 5 days after the last immunization and used directly in the assays .
Labeled targets were incubated with the indicated number of effector cells in 96-well round-bottom plates at 37°C for ~18 h. Percentage cytotoxicity = [ ( cpm experimental - cpm spontaneous ) / ( cpm total - cpm spontaneous ) ] X 100 % .
Net cytotoxicity is the percent cytotoxicity of the specific targets ( 4T1 ) minus the percent cytotoxicity of the irrelevant targets ( B16 melF1Q0 ) .
Data presented are representative of two independent experiments .
( For the second experi-ment , mice were immunized five , instead of six , times . )
An additional CTL experiment was performed using splenocytes from BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ mice immunized five times with wild-type 4T 1 cells ( same schedule and number of immunizing cells as above . )
Each CTL experiment was conducted with splenic effectors from BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ mice that were immunized concurrently using the identical immunization schedule and number of immunizing cells .
The effectors were CUTTING EDGE assayed concurrently on the same batch of target cells prepared for each experiment .
Statistical analyses A Student 's 1 test for unequal variances was performed using Microsoft Excel ( Redmond , WA ) to determine the statistical significance of indicated data .
Results Primary tumor growth is reduced and delayed in STAT6 `` - mice The BALB/c-derived 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma closely models human breast cancer in that it grows progressively in the anatomically correct site ( mammary gland ) and spontaneously metastasizes to a variety of target organs ( 21 , 24 , 28 , 29 ) .
4T1 is highly malignant in that as few as 7 X 10° cells implanted into the mammary gland lead to progressively growing primary and metastatic tumor in > 95 % of inoculated mice .
4T1 is also nonimmunogenic in that immunization with irradiated 4T 1 cells provides no protection against wild-type tumor ( 23 , 24 ) .
To assess the effects of the STAT4 and STAT6 genes on tumor growth , female BALB/c , STAT6 '~ , and STAT4 '~ mice were inoculated in the mammary gland with 4T1 tumor cells .
As shown in Fig .
1 , following inoculation of 7 X 10° 4T1 cells , onset of primary tumor growth and growth rate are slowed in STAT6 '~ mice relative to STAT4 '~ or wild-type BALB/c mice .
Therefore , deletion of the STAT6 gene reduces primary mammary tumor growth , suggesting that the presence of a functional STAT6 gene facilitates tumor cell proliferation .
Metastatic disease is reduced in STAT6 '~ mice Following inoculation into the mammary gland , 4T1 tumor cells spontaneously metastasize to the lungs , liver , brain , lymph nodes , blood , and bone marrow ( 21 , 24 , 29 ) .
The kinetics of metastasis varies with the target organs ; however , the earliest metastases are found in the lymph nodes draining the site of primary tumor growth and the lungs .
Within 2-3 wk of inoculation into the mammary gland , ~95 % of mice have metastatic cells in their lungs ( 23 , 24 ) .
Because 4T1 cells are 6-thioguanine resistant , metastatic tumor burden in target organs can be accurately quantified ( 24 ) .
To determine whether metastatic spread is affected by the STAT4 and/or STAT6 genes , BALB/c , STAT6 '~ , and STAT4 '~ mice were inoculated in the mammary gland with 7 X 10° 4T1 cells , mice were sacrificed 42 days later , and the number of 4T1 cells in their lungs were measured .
As shown in Fig .

STAT6 '~ mice challenged with 4T1 mammary tumor cells have reduced metastatic disease relative to wild-type BALB/c or STAT4~'~ mice .
Reduced disease is due to CD8 * T cells .
Mice were challenged with 4T1 tumor as in Fig .
1 .
Four weeks after tumor challenge , mice were sacrificed , lungs were removed , and the number of lung metastases was quantified .
In some experiments , STAT6 '~ mice were in vivo depleted with Abs to CD4* or CD8* , or irrelevant Abs ( IgG- group ) , before 4T1 challenge , and the lungs were assayed on day 42 .
The number of clonogenic cells in the lungs was quantified using the 6-thioguanine resistance assay ( 24 ) .
Each point represents the number of clonogenic metastatic cells from an individual animal .
The CD8-depleted STAT6 '~ group , but not the CD4-depleted STAT6 '~ group , is significantly different ( p < 0.01 ) from the undepleted STAT6 '~ and irrelevant control IgG-depleted STAT6 '~ groups .
These data are pooled from two experiments .
each , and none of the STAT6 '~ mice have > 10° metastatic cells .
Therefore , STAT6 '~ mice have fewer metastatic cells in their lungs than either STAT4~'~ or wild-type BALB/c mice , suggesting that expression of a functional STAT6 gene favors metastatic tumor growth .
Reduced primary and metastatic tumor growth is mediated by CD8* T cells and CD4* T cells are not involved To identify the effector cells responsible for the reduced tumor burdens of STAT6 '~ mice , mice were in vivo depleted for CD4 * or CD8 * T cells before tumor inoculation into the mammary gland .
Depletions were initiated on day -6 before tumor challenge and continued through day 42 of tumor growth .
Primary tumor growth was measured throughout the 42-day period .
As shown in Fig .

Depletions were started on day -6 , mice were inoculated with 4T1 tumor in the mammary gland on day 0 , and depletions were continued until day 42 when the mice were sacrificed and the number of clonogenic metastatic cells in the lungs were quantified by the 6-TG assay .
As shown in Fig .
2 , STAT6 '~ mice depleted of CD8 * T cells have higher levels of metastatic tumor cells than nondepleted STAT6 '~ mice .
In contrast , CD4-depleted and control IgG-depleted STAT6 '~ mice have very low levels of metastatic cells in the lungs , comparable to nondepleted STAT6 '~ mice .
Therefore , depletion of CD8 * T cells , but not CD4* T cells in STAT6 '~ mice , negates the anti-tumor effect , indicating that CD8 * T cells are critical for tumor rejection and that CD4 * T cells are not involved .
Tumor-specific CD8¢ CTL develop in STAT6 `` ~ mice , but not in wild-type BALB/c mice The results of Figs .
2 and 3 demonstrate that CD8 * T cells are responsible for the reduced primary tumor growth and metastases in STAT6 '~ mice .
To determine whether the difference in tumor susceptibility between STAT6 '~ , STAT4 '~ , and BALB/c mice is due to differential activation of CD8 * T cells , CTL assays were performed using splenocytes from immunized mice and `` 'Cr-labeled 4T1 cells as specific targets and B16 melF10 melanoma cells as irrelevant targets .
In initial experiments , BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ mice were immunized with irradiated wild-type 4T1 cells .
Only STAT6 '~ effectors had significant cytotoxic activity ( net cytotoxicity of 0 , 12 , and 56 % for BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ effectors , respectively , at a ratio of 120:1 ) .
For other studies , we have developed 4T 1 cell-based vaccines as therapy agents for the treatment of 4T1 tumors in wild-type BALB/c mice .
The vaccines consist of wild-type 4T1 cells trans-fected with syngeneic MHC class II and CD80 genes ( 4T1I/AY CD80 ) ( 24 ) or Streptococcus aureus enterotoxin B gene ( 4T1/ SEB ) ( 23 ) .
To determine whether STAT6 '~ mice respond selectively to the vaccines , BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ mice were immunized with 4T1/A*/CD80 plus 4TI/SEB cells , and CTL assays were performed .
As shown in Fig .
4 , STAT6 '~ mice have strong CTL activity , while effectors from STAT4 '~ mice have modest activity and BALB/c mice have minimal activity .

The increased CTL activity in 4T1-immunized STAT6 '~ mice may be due to differences in quantities of CD4 * and CD8 * T cells between BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '- mice .
To test this possibility , splenocytes from naive and immunized BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ mice were stained for CD3 ¢CD4* and CD3 ~CD8 * T cells and analyzed by flow cytometry .
Percentages of CD4* and CD8* T cells in naive BALB/c , STAT4 `` ~ , and STAT6 '~ mice do not differ between the strains ( CD4 * T cells in naive BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ mice : 24.5 , 29.3 , and 26.9 % , respectively ; CD8 * T cells : 9.4 , 9.3 , and 7.8 % , respectively ) .
Likewise , the percentages of CD4* and CD8 * T cells in immunized BALB/c , STAT4 '~ , and STAT6 '~ mice do not differ from those in naive mice ( CD4 * T cells in immunized BALB/c , STAT4 `` ~ , and STAT6 '~ mice : 25.0 , 28.2 , and 25.8 % , respectively ; CD8* T cells : 8.1 , 8.9 , and 9.4 % , respectively ) .
Therefore , the knockout mice do not have significantly more CD8 * T cells , and the increased tumor-specific CTL activity of STAT6 '~ mice can not be explained because of higher quantities of CD8 * cytotoxic cells .
Therefore , significant tumor-specific CD8 * CTL activity develops in STAT6 '~ mice , but does not develop in BALB/c or STATA '~ mice , even when the genetically modified tumor vaccines are the immunizing agent .
Discussion Although 4T1 tumor growth and metastasis are rapid and progressive in syngeneic BALB/c mice , 4T1i growth in STAT6 '~ BALB/c mice is significantly delayed and reduced .
The delayed onset and reduced growth rate of primary tumor and large reduction in metastatic tumor burden are particularly noteworthy because 4T1 mammary carcinoma is highly malignant , spontaneously metastatic , and nonimmunogenic ( 24 ) .
Because depletion of CD8 * T cells in STAT6 '~ mice restores primary tumor growth and metastasis to levels of wild-type BALB/c mice , the anti-tumor effect in STAT6 '~ mice is mediated by T lymphocytes .
Surprisingly , however , depletion of CD4 * T cells does not impact tumor growth in STAT6 '~ mice , indicating that CD4 * T cells are not involved in tumor reduction .
Therefore , the STAT6 effect is not due to an increase in tumor-specific Th1 cells , as originally hy-pothesized .
The lack of involvement of Th1 cells is also supported by the finding that STAT4 '~ mice have the same growth rate of primary tumor and metastasis formation as wild-type BALB/c mice .
If Th1 generation limited tumor growth , then mice deficient for Th1 cells would be expected to have more rapid tumor growth and metastasis formation than wild-type STAT4*'* mice .
If preferential development of tumor-specific Th1 cells is not responsible for enhanced tumor immunity in STAT6 '- mice , why does deletion of the STAT6 gene have such a profound effect on tumor growth ?
A trivial explanation is that the STAT6 '- mice are sufficiently genetically disparate from BALB/c mice that the 4T1 tumor is essentially an allograft and therefore immunogenic in STAT6 '~ mice .
This explanation is unlikely for at least two rea-sons .
First , STAT6 '~ mice have been backcrossed 10 generations to BALB/c mice , making them > 99.99 % BALB/c , and making it very unlikely that there are significant histocompatibility differences between 4T 1 tumor cells and STAT6 '~ mice .
Second , because the STAT4 '~ mice have been similarly backcrossed to BALB/c , if reduced tumor growth is due to genetic discrepancies , then STAT4 '~ mice should also exhibit reduced tumor growth ; however , their pattern of tumor progression is very similar to that of wild-type BALB/c mice .
CUTTING EDGE Because CD4 * T cells are not obviously involved , deletion of the STAT6 gene must enhance tumor immunity via a mechanism independent of CD4 * T cells .
There are several possible alternative mechanisms .
First , STAT6 '~ mice may preferentially produce Tel CD8 * T cells that are more efficacious than Tc2 cells in reducing tumor cell growth .
Second , the STAT6 gene may be involved in a signaling pathway that produces an inhibitor that blocks CD8 * T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity .
Elimination of this inhibitor results in enhanced development of tumor-specific CD8 * T effector cells .
Third , CD8 * T cells are one component of the enhanced anti-tumor effect , but other factors , such as anti-angiogenic factors , are also involved .
Inactivation of the STAT6 gene favors the development of anti-angiogenic mechanisms that limit primary tumor and metastatic tumor growth .
Therefore , STAT6 '~ mice may show reduced tumor growth due to immunologic and nonimmunologic mechanisms .
In earlier studies , the 4T1 vaccines ( 4T1/AY/CD80 plus 4T1/ SEB ) have shown significant therapeutic efficacy in wild-type BALB/c mice ( 23 , 24 ) , and in vivo CD8 * T cell depletion experiments have shown that the effect is at least partially due to CD8 * T cells .
Therefore , it is surprising that the vaccines only stimulate a significant CD8 * T cell response in STAT6 '~ mice , and not in BALB/c mice .
Regardless of the mechanism by which STAT6 '- mice have enhanced immunity , the reduction in primary tumor growth and metastatic disease is large and is unusual in that knocking out a gene results in a gain-of-function phenotype .
This observation raises the possibility that inactivation of the STAT6 '~ gene might enhance the development of tumor-specific immunity and facilitate tumor rejection and/or limit malignant cell proliferation .
