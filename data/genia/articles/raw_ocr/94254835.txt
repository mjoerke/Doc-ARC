TF is the primary cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascades .
Here we report the characterization of a nuclear complex from human monocytic cells that bound to a « B-like site , 5-CGGAGTTTCC-3 ' , in the 5'-flanking region of the human TF gene .
This nuclear complex was activated by LPS with kinetics that preceded induction of the TF gene .
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the TF site bound translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers but not p50/p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers .
Base-pair substitutions in the TF site indicated that the presence of a cytosine at position 1 precluded binding of NF- « B .
In fact , under low-ionic-strength conditions , the TF complex did not migrate with translated p50/p65 dimers but instead comigrated with c-Rel/p65 dimers .
Antibodies against the NF-KB and Rel proteins and UV cross-linking studies revealed the presence of c-Rel and p65 and the absence of p50 in the TF complex and further showed that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers selectively bound to the TF < B-like site .
Functional studies indicated that the TF site conferred LPS inducibility on a heterologous promoter and was transactivated by c-Rel or p65 .
Taken together , our results demonstrated that binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a novel site mediated LPS induction of TF gene expression in monocytic cells .
Tissue factor ( TF ) is the primary cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascades ( reviewed in reference 10 ) .
In septic shock , endotoxin-induced activation of coagulation plays a significant role in the development of multiple organ failure as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation ( 32 , 33 ) .
In rabbits , disseminated intravascular coagulation is triggered by administration of endotoxin or TF and is prevented by anti-TF antibodies ( 37 , 44 ) .
In a baboon model of septic shock , inhibition of induced TF activity with an anti-human TF monoclonal antibody attenuates the coagulopathy and protects against lethality , indicating that TF is a mediator of fatal bacteremic shock ( 40 ) .
Monocytes are the only circulating cell type that can be induced to express TF ( 22 ) .
Monocytes from septic animals consistently express higher levels of TF activity than monocytes from untreated animals ( 1 , 2 , 30 ) , indicating that these cells may be the primary source of TF expression within the vasculature of septic patients ( 32 , 33 ) .
In fact , monocytes from rabbits treated with endotoxin are thrombogenic and induce pulmonary emboli and death when infused intravenously ( 31 ) .
Stimulation of human monocytes and monocytic cells with bacterial endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] ) in vitro leads to rapid and transient induction of TF expression ( 9 , 35 ) .
Induction is primarily controlled at the level of transcriptional initiation ( 7 , 12 ) .
Recently , our functional studies demonstrated that a kB-like site ( 25 ) in the human TF promoter mediates LPS induction of the TF gene in monocytic THP-1 cells ( 23 ) .

3772 includes p50 ( NFKB1 ) , p52 ( NFKB2 ) , p65 ( RelA ) , RelB , and the proto-oncogene product c-Rel ( reviewed in references 14 and 15 ) .
This newly defined family shows a high degree of homology in an approximately 300-amino-acid region , termed the Rel homology domain , which is required for DNA binding and dimerization .
Different « B sites appear to selectively bind distinct homodimeric and heterodimeric NF-kB/Rel complexes , which may represent an important mechanism for selective control of gene expression ( 14 , 15 ) .
LPS activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins in monocytic cells may coordinate the induction of a variety of genes involved in inflammation , all of which contain « B or « B-like regulatory elements ( 28 ) .
The TF kB-like site , 5-CGGAGTTTCC-3 ' , does not match the kB binding site consensus , 5-GGGRNNYYCC-3 ' ( 14 ) , where R is A or G , Y is T or C , and N is any nucleotide , because of the presence of a cytosine at position 1 .
Recently , optimal DNA-binding motifs for selective binding of recombinant homodimers of p50 , p65 , and c-Rel were identified ( 21 ) .
Notably , the TF site was identical to one of the p65 homodimer-selected motifs .
In this study , we characterized the nuclear complex present in nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated monocytic cells that binds to the « B-like site in the 5'-flanking region of the human TF gene .
Unlike other well-characterized xB sites that have a guanine at position 1 , the presence of a cytosine at position 1 of the TF site prevented detectable binding of p50/p65 heterodimers and p50 homodimers .
Analysis of the TF nuclear complex by mobility , antibody supershift , and UV cross-linking studies indicated that it represented binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
Furthermore , functional studies revealed that the TF site could be transactivated by overexpression of c-Rel or p65 .
Taken together , our results demonstrated that exposure of monocytic cells to LPS activated c-Rel/p65 het- VoL .

14 , 1994 RESULTS LPS stimulation of human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells activates a nuclear complex that binds to the TF « B-like site .
LPS stimulation of monocytic cells induces TF gene expression that is mediated by a « B-like site in the TF promoter ( 23 ) .
To examine protein-DNA complex formation at the TF site , nuclear extracts prepared from freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells cultured in the presence or absence of LPS were analyzed by EMSA .
For all of these studies , the nuclear complex that bound to an oligonucleotide containing the TF « B-like site ( TF ) ( Fig .
1 ) was compared with NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) binding to an oligonucleotide containing the prototypic kB binding site from the murine kappa light-chain enhancer ( Igx ) ( 38 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
LPS stimulation of monocytes activated a nuclear complex that bound to the TF site and also activated NF- « B binding to the Igx site , although unstimulated monocytes from different donors contained variable levels of NF- « B ( Fig .
2 , lanes 1 to 10 ) .
The faster-migrating complexes observed with both DNA probes were abrogated by a mutated kB site ( TF , , , , , ) and represented binding of nonspecific proteins ( data not shown ) .
Because of variability between donors , the sensitivity of monocytes to activation , and contamination by other cell types , the human monocytic THP-1 cell line was chosen to characterize the nuclear complex that bound to the TF site .
Unstimulated THP-1 cells did not contain any specific nuclear proteins that bound to the TF site ( Fig .
2 , lane 13 ) .
In contrast , an inducible protein-DNA complex was observed when nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated cells were used ( Fig .
2 , lane 14 ) .
LPS activation of this TF complex was dose and time dependent and was first detected 20 min after LPS stimulation ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , LPS activated NF- « B in these monocytic THP-1 cells ( Fig .
2 , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
Again , the faster-migrating band observed with both DNA probes represented binding of a nonspecific complex which also bound to a mutated « B site ( TF. , , , , , ) ( Fig .
3 , lane 4 ) .
The abundance of this nonspecific complex was not increased by LPS stimulation .
These data indicated that LPS stimulation of monocytic THP-1 cells led to a dose- and time-dependent activation of a nuclear protein that bound to the TF site .
Effect of base-pair substitutions in the TF site .
The TF « B-like site , 55-CGGAGTTTCC-3 ' , differs from the prototypic Igx site , 5-GGGACTTTCC-3 ' , at positions 1 and 5 and does not match the « B binding site consensus because of the presence of a cytosine at position 1 .
To investigate the role of the nucleotides at positions 1 and 5 of the TF site in nuclear protein binding , oligonucleotides that contained base-pair substitutions at these positions to match the Igk site were synthesized ( Fig .
1 ) .
These oligonucleotides included TF ; , ; , which was substituted at positions 1 and 5 to make it identical to the prototypic Igx site ; TF , and TF , , which contained single-nucleotide replacements at position 1 and 5 , respec-tively ; and a mutated site , TF , , , , , , , containing a 3-bp substitution at positions 8 to 10 , which was shown to abolish the functional activity of this site ( 23 ) .
Each DNA probe was incubated with the same amount of nuclear extract from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells to demonstrate the relative intensities of the complexes .
Under these high-ionic-strength conditions , the TF complex comigrated with the Igk complex but was much less intense ( Fig .
3 ) .
The single-replacement site , TF , , formed a complex with an intensity similar to that observed with the TF site itself , whereas the TF , and TF ; , , ; replacements formed more prominent complexes , similar to the Igx complex ( Fig .
3 ) .
No specific complex was observed when TF. , . , , was used , although the faster-migrating nonspecific complex was still BINDING OF c-Rel/p65 HETERODIMERS TO A « kB-LIKE SITE 3775 Probe : _ Igx TF TF TF Igx rara I usm | U 1T 1 p3 8 u > I Le Ro 2 e eeg .

TF nuclear complex comigrates with c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
The mobility of the TF and Ig complexes was compared with that of various translated homo- and heterodimeric complexes in a low-ionic-strength 6 % acrylamide gel ( Novex , San Diego , Calif. ) .
The positions of the TF ( arrow ) and Igx ( NF-kB ) complexes are indicated , together with the mobilities of the p50/p50 , p50/p65 , c-Rel/c-Rel , c-Rel/p65 , and p65/p65 complexes .

observed .
These results indicated that the cytosine at position 1 of the TF site dramatically affected nuclear protein binding , whereas binding was independent of changes at position 5 .
TF B-like site binds p6S and c-Rel homodimers but not p50/p65 heterodimers or pSO homodimers .
A recent study identified decameric binding motifs preferred by recombinant p50 , p65 , and c-Rel homodimers ( 21 ) .
Notably , the TF site was identical to a p65 homodimer-selected binding site ( 21 ) .
Previous studies have shown that the p50 subunit of NF- « B binds to the more conserved pentameric A half-site , 5'-GGGAC-3 ' , of the Igx site and prefers three consecutive G 's in positions 1 to 3 , whereas p65 binds to the less-conserved B half-site , 5'-TTTCC-3 ' ( 43 , 45 ) .
To compare the binding of NF- « B/Re !
family proteins to the TF and Igx sites , in vitro binding studies were performed with recombinant and translated p65 , p50 , and c-Rel proteins .
The TF and Igx sites bound similar amounts of recombinant p65 homodimers , whereas only the Igx site bound p50 homodimers ( Fig .
4A ) .
In addition , the TF site bound translated p65 and c-Rel homodimers but did not bind p50 homodimers or p50/p65 heterodimers ( Fig .
4B , lanes 6 to 10 ) .
In contrast , the Igx site bound p50 and p65 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers but not c-Rel homodimers ( Fig .
4B , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
Monospecific anti-p50 , anti-p65 , and anti-c-Rel antibodies were used to confirm the identity of the p50 , p65 , and c-Rel homodimers ( Fig .
4C ) .
Supershift complexes were observed with the anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies , whereas the anti-c-Rel antibody , which was raised against the Rel homology domain ( see Materials and Methods ) , abolished protein binding without the formation of a supershift band .
These results demonstrated that the TF site bound p65 and c-Rel homodimers but did not bind detectable amounts of pS50/p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers .
Clearly , the nucleotide sequence of the TF site selectively bound NF-xB/Re !
proteins which were distinct from the p50-containing complexes that bound to the Igx site .
TF nuclear complex comigrates with c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .

Identification of NF- « B/Re !
proteins present in the TF complex .
The TF and Igx complexes formed under high-ionic-strength conditions were analyzed with monospecific antibodies that specifically recognize p50 , p65 , and c-Rel .
Antibody or prebleed serum ( PB ) was added 20 min before addition of the **P-labeled DNA probe .
( A ) The antibodies used were an anti-p65 antibody ( p65-CAb ) ( lanes 3 and 7 ) , an anti-p50 antibody ( p50-NAb ) ( lanes 4 and 8 ) , and an anti-c-Re ! l antibody ( c-Rel-CAb 324 ) ( lanes 2 and 6 ) .
Prebleed samples for each antibody are shown in lanes 2 ' to 4 ' and 6 ' to 8 ' .
( B ) The antibodies used were anti-c-Rel antibody c-Rel-CAb 324 ( lane 2 ) , anti-c-Rel antibody 1136 ( lane 4 ) , anti-p50 antibody p50-CAb ( lane 6 ) , anti-p65 antibody p6S5-NAb ( lanes 7 , 10 , and 11 ) , and anti-c-Rel antibody c-Rel-Ab ( lanes 8 , 10 , and 12 ) .
A 2-pl amount of each antibody was used except for the affinity-purified antibodies ( 5 pl ) ; 10 pl of antibody was used in lanes 11 and 12 .
The TF complex is shown by an arrow , and the slower-migrating supershift bands are indicated by the bracket .
The nonspecific band was not recognized by any of the antisera .

The positions of adducts formed by cross-linking of p50 ( 55 kDa ) , p65 ( 75 kDa ) , and c-Rel ( 85 kDa ) are indicated .
The positions of size markers are shown on the right .

proteins translated alone or in combination .
Under these conditions , the TF complex was observed as a single band that migrated more slowly than the Igx complex ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In fact , the TF complex comigrated with translated c-Rel/ p65 heterodimers and migrated independently of p65 and c-Rel homodimers ( Fig .
5 , lanes 3-8 ) .
As expected , the Igx complex comigrated with p50/p65 heterodimers .
These data suggested that the TF complex may represent binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
Identification of NF- « B/Rel proteins present in TF nuclear complex .
To directly identify the NF- « B/Rel proteins present in the TF complex from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells , supershift experiments were performed with monospecific anti-p50 , anti-p65 , and anti-c-Rel antibodies .
Initial studies revealed that the TF complex was strongly supershifted with an anti-p65 antibody and weakly supershifted with anti-c-Rel antibody 324 , but was not recognized by an anti-p50 antibody ( Fig .
6A , lanes 6 to 8 ) .
In contrast , the Igx complex was supershifted with the anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies but was not recognized by the anti-c-Rel antibody ( Fig .
6A , lanes 2 to 4 ) , consistent with the binding of p50/p65 heterodimers .
Notably , the modified TF sites TF , ; and TF ; , , ; bound p50/p65 heterodimers ( data not BINDING OF c-Rel/p65 HETERODIMERS TO A « B-LIKE SITE 3777 shown ) .
No reactivity was observed with the respective prebleed sera ( Fig .
6A ) .
More detailed studies were performed with additional antibodies to determine the exact protein composition of the TF complex .
Further analysis of anti-c-Rel antibody 324 and a second anti-c-Rel antibody , 1136 , indicated that both strongly supershifted the TF complex ( Fig .
6B , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The results with a second set of affinity-purified anti-p50 , anti-p65 , and anti-c-Rel antibodies again demonstrated that the TF complex contained c-Rel and p65 but not p50 ( Fig .
6B , lanes 6 to 8 ) .
More importantly , an excess of either anti-p65 or anti-c-Rel antibodies ( Fig .
6B , lanes 11 and 12 ) virtually abolished the TF complex , strongly suggesting that the traces of TF complex remaining in the presence of these antibodies were not due to binding of c-Rel or p65 homodimers .
Residual TF complexes were completely abolished when both antibodies ( 5 pl each ) were added simultaneously ( Fig .
6B , lane 10 ) .
We concluded that the TF complex represented binding of c-Rel/ p65 heterodimers .
To independently confirm that the TF complex comprised c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , protein-DNA complexes formed between a photoreactive TF site ( TFx ) ( Fig .
1 ) , containing bromodeoxyuridine , and nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were exposed to UV light and then immunoprecipitated with anti-p50 , anti-p65 , or anti-c-Rel antibodies .
The anti-c-Rel antibody immunoprecipitated an 85-kDa protein-DNA adduct , consistent with binding of c-Rel ( Fig .
7A , lane 4 ) .
The 75-kDa adduct observed with this antibody may represent coimmunoprecipitation of cross-linked p65 or a degradation product of c-Rel .
The anti-p65 antibody immunoprecipitated a 75-kDa adduct , indicating binding of p65 ( Fig .
7A , lane 7 ) .
The 42-kDa adduct may represent binding of a C-terminally truncated p65 protein .
Recently , a proteolytically truncated p65 protein that retains DNA-binding and dimerization properties was observed in nuclear extracts from myelomonocytic cells ( 38a ) .
No proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-p50 antibody , confirming that p50 did not bind to the TF site ( Fig .
7A , lane 2 ) .
In contrast , the anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies immunoprecipitated 75- and 55-kDa adducts that were cross-linked to the Igx site ( Igkx1 ) ( Fig .
1 ) , whereas no protein was observed with the anti-c-Rel antibody , indicating binding of p50/p65 heterodimers ( Fig .
7A ) .
Protein-DNA complexes were also cross-linked to the TF site ( TFx ) or Igx site ( Igkx2 ) ( Fig .
1 ) in native gels before analysis by SDS-PAGE .
Under these conditions , approximately equal amounts of 85- and 75-kDa adducts were cross-linked to the TF site , consistent with binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers ( Fig .
7B , lane 2 ) .
The Igx site bound 75- and 55-kDa adducts , indicating binding of p50/p65 heterodimers .
A 42-kDa adduct was observed with both DNA probes , possibly representing binding of truncated p65 .
Functional analysis of TF < B-like site .
To determine the role of the TF < B-like site in vivo , functional studies were performed with plasmids containing four tandem copies of the TF site cloned upstream of a minimal simian virus 40 promoter expressing the luciferase reporter gene ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Transient transfection of THP-1 cells showed that the TF site conferred LPS responsiveness on this heterologous promoter , as did the prototypic Igx site ( Fig .
8A ) .
The mutation of the TF site in p ( TF , , , , ) , LUC abolished LPS responsiveness .
To demonstrate a role for p65 in LPS induction mediated by the TF site , plasmids expressing antisense or sense p65 were cotransfected with the TF reporter plasmid .
Antisense p65 significantly reduced the magnitude of LPS induction , whereas a control plasmid expressing sense p65 had no effect ( Fig .
8B ) .
In addition , LPS induction was reduced by 3778 OETH ET AL .

Functional analysis of the TF « B-like site in vivo .
( A ) THP-1 cells were transfected with various plasmids ( 4 mg ) ( see Materials and Methods ) and cultured for 46 h before LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) was added to a portion of the cells for 5 h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates from transfected cells was determined with the Luciferase Assay System ( Promega Corp. ) and normalized to the amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activity expressed by pCAT-control ( Promega Corp. ) .
The fold induction by LPS is expressed as the mean * standard deviation for three experiments .
Plasmids p ( TF ) , LUC , p ( TF , , , , , , ) ; LUC , and p ( Igx ) , LUC and the vector ( pGL2-promoter ) are described in the text .
( B ) LPS induction of p ( TF ) , LUC ( 4 ug ) transfected into THP-1 cells was determined alone or in the presence of plasmids ( 2 ug ) expressing p65 antisense ( p65AS ) , p65 sense ( p65S ) , or IxB ( pCMVIKB ) .
Results are expressed as fold induction + standard deviation for three experiments .
( C ) Transactivation of the TF site .
Jurkat cells were transfected with p ( TF ) , CAT ( 3 ug ) or p ( TF , , , , ) , CAT alone or in the presence of plasmids ( 1 jg ) that express p50 , p65 , p50-p65 , and c-Rel ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Results from a typical experiment are shown .
overexpression of IxB ( Fig .
8B ) .
This inhibitor can bind to p65 or c-Rel ( 5 , 34 ) , suggesting that interaction with either p65 or c-Rel may result in inhibition of LPS induction .
Therefore , these data indicated that binding of p65 to the TF site was required for LPS induction of gene expression in monocytic THP-1 cells .
Attempts to transactivate the TF site or Igx site by overexpression of NF- « B and Rel proteins in monocytic THP-1 cells were unsuccessful .
Other studies have reported that success in such transactivation experiments can depend on the type of cells transfected ( 39 ) .
Therefore , transactivation experiments were performed with Jurkat T cells .
The TF site was transactivated by overexpression of either p65 or c-Rel alone , confirming that these proteins can bind to the site in vivo ( Fig .
8C ) .
Transactivation by p65 was greater than that by c-Rel , and the level of transactivation produced by simultaneous expression of p65 and c-Rel was similar to that observed with c-Rel alone rather than p65 alone .
This result may indicate that c-Rel/c-Rel homodimers and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers have a lower activation potential than p65 homodimers .
Overexpression of p50 or a chimeric p50 protein , p50-p65 , containing the DNA-binding region of p50 fused to the transactivation domain of p65 , failed VoL .

to transactivate the TF site .
In addition , mutation of the site abolished transactivation by p65 and c-Rel .
These results indicated that p65 and c-Rel can bind to the TF kB-like site in vivo to activate gene expression .
DISCUSSION This study demonstrated that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , present in nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated monocytic THP-1 cells , selectively bound to a « kB-like site , AGTITCC-3 ' , in the human TF promoter .
Several independent experimental approaches were used to characterize the TF nuclear complex .
First , this complex comigrated with translated c-Rel/p65 dimers and not with pS50/p65 dimers .
Second , the TF complex was recognized by anti-c-Rel and anti-p65 antibodies but not by anti-p50 antibodies .
Third , approximately equal amounts of c-Rel and p65 were cross-linked to the TF « B-like site when nuclear extracts were used .
Finally , functional studies indicated that this site conferred LPS inducibility on a heterologous promoter in THP-1 cells and was transactivated by c-Rel or p65 in Jurkat T cells .
The rapid activation of c-Rel/p65 dimers by LPS preceded the induction of TF gene expression in THP-1 cells ( 7 ) , indicating that this heterodimeric complex acts as a positive regulator of transcription .
Taken together , these data clearly indicated that the TF < B-like site was regulated by c-Rel/p65 dimers and not by the more extensively studied p50/p65 dimers .
The TF site was designated « B-like by us because it contains a cytosine at position 1 and therefore does not fit the proposed consensus for xB binding sites , 5-GGGRNNYYCC-3 ' ( 14 ) .
In fact , the TF site was identical to one of the p65 homodimer-selected motifs described by Kunsch et al .
( 21 ) , which contain C or T at position 1 in 44 % of the sequences .
Our binding studies showed that the TF site did indeed bind translated p65 homodimers as well as c-Rel homodimers and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , but it did not bind p50 homodimers or p50/p65 heterodimers .
Base-pair substitutions in the TF site revealed that the cytosine at position 1 permitted selective binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers while precluding binding of p50-containing complexes , which require three consecutive G 's ( 43 , 45 ) .
The importance of this first nucleotide is emphasized by the conservation of the same nonconsensus C in the murine TF promoter ( 24 ) and the presence of a T in the porcine TF promoter ( 18 ) ( Table 1 ) .
Similarly , the « B-like site in the interleukin-8 gene ( 26 ) contains a T at position 1 and bound translated p65 and c-Rel homodimers but not p50 homodimers or p50/p65 heterodimers ( 20 ) ( Table 1 ) .
Furthermore , our preliminary studies indicated that the interleukin-8 site bound c-Rel/p65 heterodimers present in nuclear extracts from monocytic THP-1 cells ( 31a ) .
UV cross-linking studies with the TF site suggested that c-Rel exhibited some preferential binding to the A half-site , whereas p65 bound to the B half-site ( data not shown ) .
We propose from these results that the TF site may be a prototypic member of a distinct class of « B-like binding sites with the consensus 5'-Y¥GGANTTTCC-3 ' that do not bind p50/p65 dimers but instead selectively bind c-Rel/p65 dimers ( Table 1 ) .
Future studies may reveal other < B-like sites that belong to this class .
Previous studies of xB sites that bind purified p65 failed to identify p65 homodimers in nuclear extracts ( 20 , 42 ) .
Recently , the presence of an endogenous pool of inducible p65 homodimers in human T cells was revealed under optimized binding conditions with an artificial palindromic , high-affinity kB site ( 11 ) .
Moreover , cellular activation of monocytic cells is required for nuclear expression of p65 ( 19 ) .
In our study , despite the ability of translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers to bind to the TF site , we found no evidence that nuclear extracts from monocytic THP-1 cells contained either of these homodimeric proteins .
It is possible that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers form in vivo in preference to their respective homodimers .
The xB-like site in the urokinase gene ( Table 1 ) is the only other site reported to bind c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , although this site also bound p50/p65 heterodimers , making it difficult to determine the functional significance of c-Rel/p65 binding ( 16 ) .
The identification of c-Rel/p65 dimers in nuclear extracts from monocytic cells strongly suggests that this complex plays a central role in controlling gene expression in this cell type .
The activation of NF- « B/Rel family proteins in monocytic cells exposed to LPS may coordinate the induction of a variety of genes , all of which contain « B or kB-like sites ( 28 ) .
Previous reports indicated that human monocytes constitutively express NF- « B binding activity ( 13 , 17 ) .
In contrast , our studies clearly show that freshly isolated monocytes from different donors contained undetectable to intermediate levels of NF-kB .
These differences may reflect various degrees of monocyte activation during isolation and subsequent culture .
Our demonstration that LPS stimulation of human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells dramatically activated NF-kB and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers indicates a role for NF- « kB and Rel proteins in inducible gene expression in these cells .
The binding of different homo- and heterodimers to distinct kB and « B-like sites 3780 OETH ET AL .
represents an important mechanism for selective control of gene expression .
Regulation by different NF- « kB/Re !
proteins may include distinct inhibitory mechanisms that control the transient nature of gene expression in monocytic cells .
Moreover , external stimuli may selectively activate c-Rel/p65 dimers in preference to p50/p65 dimers .
Only trace amounts of c-Rel have been found in THP-1 cells ( 19 ) , which may explain why we observed that c-Rel/p65 dimers were much less abundant than p50/p65 dimers .
The TF protein is a very potent initiator of blood coagulation that can induce disseminated intravascular coagulation .
Therefore , the low levels of c-Rel/p65 dimers may represent a mechanism for limiting TF gene expression in monocytic cells .
