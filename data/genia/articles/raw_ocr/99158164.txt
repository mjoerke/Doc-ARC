stockton-press.co.uk/onc Binding of c-Rel to STATS target sequences in HTLV-I-transformed T cells Shao-Cong Sun ' , Sanjay B Maggirwar ' , Edward W Harhaj ' and Mark Uhlik ' 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine , Hershey Medical Center , PO Box 850 , Hershey , Pennsylvania 17033 , USA The type I human T-cell leukemia virus induces abnormal growth and subsequent transformation of T cells , which is associated with the development of an acute T-cell malignancy termed adult T-cell leukemia .
A characteristic of HTLV-I-transformed T cells is the constitutive nuclear expression of NF-xB/Rel family of transcription factors , which appears to be essential for the growth of these transformed cells .
Although NF-xB/ Rel factors are known to induce the expression of T-cell growth factor interleukin ( IL ) -2 , it is unclear how they participate in the IL-2-independent growth of HTLV-I-transformed cells .
In this study , we show that certain NF-xB/Rel members , predominantly c-Rel , interact with enhancer sequences for STATS , a key transcription factor mediating IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation .
Reporter gene assays reveal that the binding of c-Rel to the STATS site present in the FcyR1 gene leads to potent transactivation of this enhancer .
Binding of c-Rel to the FcyR1 STAT site also occurs in human peripheral blood T cells immortalized with HTLV-I in vitro and is correlated with enhanced levels of proliferation of these cells .
These results raise the possibility that NF-xB/Rel may participate in the growth control of HTLV-I-transformed T cells by regulating genes driven by both xB and certain STAT enhancers .
Keywords : HTLV-I ; c-Rel ; STAT ; T-cell transforma-tion ; NF-xB Introduction The proliferation of normal T cells is tightly controlled by various cytokines , most importantly interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , which is produced as a result of antigen-mediated activation of resting T cells ( Schwartz , 1990 ) .
Binding of cytokines to their cell surface receptors triggers a cascade of signal transduc-tion events leading to the activation of various protein tyrosine kinases ( PTK ) , including members of the Janus kinase ( JAK ) family ( Johnston et al. , 1994 ; Witthuhn et al. , 1994 ) .
The JAKs then phosphorylate and induce the dimerization and nuclear translocation of a family of enhancer binding proteins termed signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) ( Darnell et al. , 1994 ; Ihle , 1996 ; Schindler and Correspondence : S-C Sun *Current address : Department of Microbiology and Immunology , University of Rochester Medical Center , 575 Elmwood Avenue , Box 672 , Rochester , NY14642 , USA Received 14 May 1998 ; revised 16 September 1998 ; accepted 16 September 1998 Darnell , 1995 ) .
The STAT factors function by binding to an enhancer element termed interferon gamma-activated site ( GAS ) that is present in the promoter regions of various cytokine-regulated genes ( Darnell et al. , 1994 ; Ihle , 1996 ; Schindler and Darnell , 1995 ) .
The distinct biological effects of different cytokines appear to be mediated , at least partially , by the activation of specific STAT factors ( Ihle , 1996 ) .
Different STAT factors in turn recognize distinct GAS sequences and regulate different target genes ( Ihle , 1996 ; Lin et al. , 1995 ; O'Shea , 1997 ) .
In lymphoid cells , IL-2 is known to induce STATS as well as STAT3 ( Fujii et al. , 1995 ; Johnston et al. , 1994 , 1995 ; Witthuhn et al. , 1994 ) .
While the proliferation of normal T cells largely relies on the action of IL-2 , under certain situations T cells may undergo proliferation even in the absence of IL-2 .
One example is seen with T cells infected with the type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) , the etiologic agent of an acute and often fatal T cell malignancy termed adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) ( Poiesz et al. , 1980 ; Yoshida et al. , 1982 ) .
HTLV-I preferentially infects CD4*T cells , enabling them to undergo spontaneous proliferation in vitro , even though these cells rarely produce IL-2 ( Héollsberg et al. , 1992 ) .
Precisely how HTLV-I induces the IL-2-independent proliferation of T cells remains elusive .
However , emerging evidence suggests that deregulation of various cellular transcription factors by the virus may play an important role ( Ressler et al. , 1996 ) .
In this regard , HTLV-I encodes a transactivator protein termed Tax , which activates or enhances the activity of a number of cellular transcription factors , including members from the NF-xB/Rel families ( Smith and Greene , 1991 ; Yoshida , 1995 ) .
The nuclear expression of NF-xB/Rel appears to be essential for the growth of both Tax-transformed murine fibroblasts and HTLV-I-transformed human T cells ( Akagi et al. , 1997 ; Kitajima et al. , 1992 ; Yamaoka et al. , 1996 ) .
The NF-xB/Rel family is composed of at least five members , including p50 , p52 , RelA , RelB and the proto-oncoprotein c-Rel ( reviewed in Gilmore , 1990 ; Siebenlist et al. , 1994 ) .
In normal T cells , as in many other cell types , the biological activity of NF-xB/Rel is tightly regulated through its cytoplasmic retention by specific inhibitory proteins termed IxB ( Beg and Baldwin , 1993 ) .
Activation of NF-xB/Rel by immuno-logical and mitogenic signals involves the induction of IxB phosphorylation and proteolysis , allowing the released NF-xB/Rel factors to enter the nucleus ( Beg and Baldwin , 1993 ; Stancovski and Baltimore , 1997 ) .
Interestingly , Tax can induce the persistent phosphorylation and degradation of the IxB molecules , resulting in the constitutive nuclear expression of NF-xB/Rel Functional binding of c-Rel to STATS target sequences SC Sun et al 1402 ( Brockman et al. , 1995 ; Good and Sun , 1996 ; Kanno et al. , 1994 ; Lacoste et al. , 1995 ; McKinsey et al. , 1996 ; Sun et al. , 1994 ) .
Among the NF-xB/Rel factors , c-Rel is a predominant form in HTLV-I-transformed T cells ( Li et al. , 1993 ) .
Although c-Rel is clearly required for transcriptional activation of the IL-2 genes ( Kontgen et al. , 1995 ) , it is unclear how the Rel protein participates in the growth control of HTLV-I-transformed cells .
In addition to NF-xB/Rel , recent studies have shown that certain STAT factors are constitutively activated in some HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines ( Migone et al. , 1995 ; Mulloy et al. , 1998 ; Takemoto et al. , 1997 ) .
Thus , the deregulated expression of STAT target genes may contribute to HTLV-I-induced IL-2-independent T-cell proliferation .
In the present study , we show that members of the NF- « xB/ Rel family , especially c-Rel , can also bind to the target DNA sequence of STATs and transactivate STAT-specific reporter genes .
These findings raise the intriguing possibility that NF-xB/Rel factors may participate in the regulation of certain STAT target genes .
Results Constitutive activation of GAS-binding nuclear factors in HTLV-I-transformed T cells To investigate whether constitutive activation of STAT factors is a common feature for HTLV-I-transformed T cells , EMSA was performed to examine the FoyR1 GAS-binding activity in a number of IL-2-independent HTLV-I-transformed human T-cell lines .
As shown in Figure 1 , no significant DNA binding activity was detected from the extracts of normal resting peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL , lane 1 ) or the HTLV-I-negative Jurkat leukemic T cells ( lane 2 ) .
In contrast , strong GAS-binding activity was detected ( C1 and C2 ) C14 C24 » NS 44 > { bl 41 } 1660ng Figure 1 Constitutive GAS-binding activity in HTLV-I-transformed T cells .
Nuclear extracts were isolated from IL-2-starved peripheral blood T cells ( PBL ) , Jurkat T cells , or the indicated HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines .
STAT-like DNA binding activity was detected by EMSA using a *°P-radiolabelled probe covering the FeyR1 GAS element .
Two specific complexes ( Cl and C2 ) were detected .
NS indicates a non-specific band from each of the HTLV-I-transformed cell lines , including MT2 ( lane 3 ) , C8166 ( lane 4 ) , HUTI1O2 ( lane 5 ) , and SLB-1 ( lane 6 ) .
We then analysed the composition of the GAS-binding protein complexes using antibody 'supershift ' assays .
As previously reported ( Migone et al. , 1995 ) , the GAS-binding factors from the MT-2 cells included both STATS and STAT3 , since one of the complexes ( Cl ) was supershifted by antisera specific for human STATS ( Figure 2 , lane 2 ) and STAT3 ( lane 3 ) but not by a preimmune serum ( lane 4 ) .
Using the same strategy , STAT5 , although not STAT3 , was also detected from HUTIO2 cells ( lanes 5-7 ) .
Unexpectedly , however , neither anti-STATS5 nor anti-STAT3 immunoreacted with the C2 complex detected from C8166 ( lanes 8-10 ) , SLB-1 ( 11-13 ) , as well as the MT-2 and HUT102 cells ( lanes 1-7 , C2 ) .

( a ) Antibody supershift analyses of the GAS-binding complex detected from C8166 cells EMSA was performed in the absence ( none ) or presence of the indicated preimmune or specific antisera .
The arrowhead indicates a complex migrating more slowly than C2 ( but faster than C1 ) .
Both this faint complex and C2 weakly immunoreacted with antisera for p50 ( lane 4 ) and p52 ( lane 5 ) Functional binding of c-Rel to STATS target sequences SC Sun et al The c-Rel proto-oncoprotein is a predominant GAS-binding factor in HTLV-I-transformed T cells To examine the molecular nature of the C2 complex , supershift assays were performed using antibodies specific for various transcription factors known to be activated in HTLV-I-transformed T cells ( Figure 3 ) .
Antisera for the p50 and p52 subunits of NF-xB/Rel partially supershifted the C2 complex detected in C8166 cells ( Figure 3a , lanes 4 and 5 ) , while no immunoreactivity was observed with a preimmune serum ( lane 8 ) or antisera for RelA ( lane 6 ) , STAT3 ( lane 3 ) and STATS ( lane 2 ) .
Remarkably , the entire GAS-binding complex was supershifted by a peptide-specific antibody for c-Rel ( lane 7 ) .
We noticed that a weak and more slowly migrating complex could be occasionally detected in our EMSA ( Figure 3a , arrowhead ) .
This complex , which migrated slightly faster than the STATS-containing C1 complex ( data not shown ) had no immunoreactivity with the antibodies for STATS5 ( Figure 3a , lane 2 ) or STAT3 ( lane 3 ) but was completely supershifted by the anti-c-Rel antibody ( lane 7 ) .
Similar supershift assays demonstrated that the C2 complex detected in the other three HTLV-I-transformed cell lines was also supershifted by the anti-c-Rel antibody ( Figure 3b , lanes 2 , 9 and 12 ) .
The supershift generated by the anti-c-Rel antibody was specific since this antibody failed to supershift the STATS complex detected from the IL-2-stimulated HT-2 cells ( Figure 3¢c , lane 4 ) .
Thus , c-Rel appears to be a major GAS-binding factor in all the four HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines analysed .
c-Rel preferentially binds to STAT5-specific GAS-related sequences We then performed oligonucleotide competition assays to compare the DNA binding specificity of c-Rel and STAT .
For these studies , we used a nuclear extract isolated from the MT-2 cells since it contained DNA binding activity of both STATS and c-Rel ( see Figures 2 and 3b ) .
As expected , the binding of STATS to the `` P-labeled FcyRI GAS probe was completely abrogated when excess amounts ( 50- or 100-fold molar excess ) of the same probe was added to the EMSA reaction ( Figure 4b , lanes 2 and 3 , upper band ) .
Similarly , formation of the c-Rel complex was also blocked under these conditions ( lanes 2 and 3 , lower band ) .
The efficiency of competition for the STATS- and c-Rel-DNA complexes was similar , suggesting that these two factors have similar binding affinity to the FcoyRI1 GAS sequence .
However , STATS and c-Rel appeared to have markedly different binding affinity to the IL-2R « xB site , as this probe selectively competed the formation of the c-Rel/GAS complex but had no obvious effect on formation of the STAT5S/GAS and were completely supershifted by the anti-c-Rel antiserum ( lane 7 ) .

( a ) Sequence of the oligonucleo-tides used in the competition assays .
Only the sense strand sequences are shown .
( b ) EMSA was performed using the radiolabeled wildtype FcyR1 GAS probe and MT-2 nuclear extract either in the absence ( - ) or presence of the indicated amounts ( fold molar excess ) of various unlabeled oligonucleotide probes .
The identity of the STATS5-and c-Rel-containing complexes was determined by antibody supershift assays ( data not shown , also see Figures 2 and 3b ) .
( c ) Competition assays were performed using radiolabeled IL-2R « xB probe and C8166 nuclear extract either in the absence ( - ) or presense of the indicated amounts ( fold molar excess ) of the indicated unlabeled oligonucleotide probes complex ( Figure 4b , lanes 16 and 17 ) .
To compare the binding affinity of c-Rel to the two different probes , a parallel competion assay was performed using the P-radiolabeled IL-2R « xB as probe and unlabeled FoyR1 GAS ( Figure 4¢ , lanes 2-4 ) or IL-2Ra « xB ( lanes 5-7 ) as competitors .
The xB sequence ( lane 5-7 ) exhibited significantly higher competition efficiency than the GAS sequence ( lanes 2-4 ) .
Thus , it appears that c-Rel and STATS bind to the GAS sequence with similar affinity , whereas c-Rel has much higher kB binding affinity than STATS .
The DNA binding specificity of STATS5 and c-Rel was examined by performing competition assays with a probe harboring base changes .
When three cytidines were mutated to guanines at the core region of the FcoyRl GAS site ( Figure 4a , FoyRl Mut , underlined bases ) , it abolished the ability of this oligonucleotide to compete for binding to STATS5 as well as to c-Rel ( lanes 18 and 19 ) .
These results suggested that the binding of both STATS and c-Rel to this probe was highly specific and that these two factors may bind to the same or overlapping sites in the FcoyR1 sequence .
To investigate whether c-Rel also binds to other STAT target sequences , the ability of various GAS-related sequences to compete with the FcyRI probe for binding to c-Rel was analysed .
In this regard , prior studies have shown that different STAT factors may bind to distinct GAS elements ( Ihle , 1996 ; O'Shea , 1997 ) .
For example , STATS specifically binds to the FcyR1 , IRF-1 and APRE GAS sites but not to other GAS-like sequences , such as Ly6E , Is , SIE and ISRE ( Mui et al. , 1995 ) , ( see Figure 4a for sequence information ) .
Consistent with the previous studies , formation of the STATS complex was markedly inhibited by the IRF-1 , APRE , as well as FcoyR1 , GAS sequences ( lanes 2-7 ) .
More importantly , the binding of c-Rel was also efficiently competed ( lanes 2-7 ) .
On the other hand , none of the Is group of GAS sequences ( Is , Ly6GE , SIE and ISRE ) competed the formation of the STATS or c-Rel complexes ( lanes 8-15 ) .
Thus , c-Rel appears to specifically recognize the GAS sequences for STATS .
Transfected c-Rel binds to and transactivates the FeyR1 GAS element To evaluate the functional importance of c-Rel binding to GAS sequence , the effect of c-Rel on transcriptional activity of the FoyR1 GAS element was analysed by reporter gene assays .
As shown in Figure Sa , transiently expressed c-Rel bound to the GAS sequence and formed a DNA-protein complex ( Figure Sa , lane 2 ) , which could be supershifted by the anti-c-Rel antibody ( data not shown ) .
This finding confirmed the ability of c-Rel to bind to the GAS sequence .
Furthermore , this specific DNA binding activity of c-Rel requires its N-terminal sequences , since deletion of 32 amino acids from the N-terminus of c-Rel generated a mutant ( 33-587 ) deficient in the GAS binding ( Figure Sa , lane 4 ) .
On the other hand , deletion of up to 280 amino acids from the C-terminus of the molecule had no effect on the DNA binding activity of c-Rel ( lane 3 ) .
Parallel luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that the transiently transfected wildtype c-Rel potently transactivated a luciferase reporter gene driven by the FcyRI GAS sequences ( Figure 5b , column 2 ) .
Consistent with its deficiency in DNA binding , the c-Rel N-terminal deletion mutant ( 33-587 ) failed to transactivate the GAS reporter ( column 4 ) .
Although the C-terminal deletion mutant of c-Rel was able to bind the GAS sequence ( Figure 5a ) , this mutant did not transactivate the reporter ( Figure 5b , column 3 ) .
This result was in agreement with the finding that the C-terminal portion of c-Rel contains its transactivation domain ( Doerre et al. , 1993 ) .
Thus , the protooncoprotein c-Rel serves as a potent transcriptional activator of the GAS enhancer element , and this function of c-Rel requires both its N-terminal DNA binding and C-terminal transactivation domains .
We also examined the effect of RelA on the transcriptional activity of the GAS enhancer ( Figure 5¢c ) and showed that RelA exhibited much lower GAS transactivation activity than c-Rel , although RelA is a stronger activator of the xB enhancer ( data not shown ) .
This result is consistent with the finding that c-Rel is the predominant GAS binding NF-xB component in both HTLV-I-infected cells and cells transiently expressing c-Rel and RelA ( Figure 3a and data not shown ) .
Induction of GAS-binding factors correlates with HTLYV-I-induced T-cell proliferation To examine the physiological relevance of our findings obtained with individual HTLV-I-transformed cell lines , we tested whether GAS-binding factors are also induced along with HTLV-I-induced T cell transforma-tion .
For these studies , bulk human peripheral blood T cells were immortalized with HTLV-I by in vitro cultivation with y-irradiated HTLV-I donor cells ( MT-2 ) .
As previously reported ( Persaud et al. , 1995 ) , proliferation of the newly immortalized T cells stringently requires exogenous IL-2 , but they become less IL-2 dependent and proliferate in the presence of suboptimal amounts of exogenous IL-2 after about 4 months in culture ( data not shown ) .
Although long term cultivation of these cells required exogenous IL-2 , these cells could proliferate in the absence of IL-2 or mitogenic stimuli for short periods ( up to 96 h , Figure 6a and data not shown ) .
In sharp contrast , the normal uninfected T cells did not proliferate unless stimulated with mitogens ( Figure 6a ) .
Similar IL-2-independent growth was previously also demonstrated with HTLV-TI-infected antigen-specific T-cell clones ( Hollsberg et al. , 1992 ) .
We then analysed the GAS-binding activity in both the normal and HTLV-I-immortalized T cells by EMSA using the FcyRl GAS element as probe .
In IL-2-starved normal T cells , no GAS-binding activity was detected ( Figure 6b , lane 1 ) .
Upon stimulation with the mitogens , GAS-binding factors were clearly induced ( lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Antibody supershift assays showed that the GAS-binding complexes formed in normal T cells treated for 8 h were supershifted by antibodies for both STATS ( Figure 6¢ , lane 2 ) and c-Rel ( lane 3 ) , but did not react with a preimmune serum ( lane 1 ) or an unrelated immune serum ( anti-NF-ATp , lane 4 ) .
Thus , the mitogen stimulated T-cell proliferation was correlated with the induction of GAS-binding factors including both STATS and c-Rel .
Interestingly , strong GAS-binding activity was detected in the untreated HTLV-I-immortalized T cells Functional binding of c-Rel to STATS target sequences SC Sun et al ( Figure 6b , lane 4 ) .
Stimulation of these cells with PHA did not significantly alter the pattern of the GAS-binding complex formation ( data not shown ) .

The expression of c-Rel and its mutants was confirmed by a parallel immunoblotting assay using a peptide-specific anti-c-Rel antibody ( data not shown ) .

Figure 6 Proliferation and GAS-binding detected with normal and HTLV-I-immortalized human peripheral blood T cells .
( a ) Cell proliferation assays .
Human peripheral blood T cells were immortalized with HTLV-I as described in Materials and methods .
The immortalized ( column 3 ) as well as normal uninfected T cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) were starved for 30 h in media lacking IL-2 and then either left untreated ( lanes 1 and 3 ) or incubated with PMA plus PHA for 36 h ( lane 2 ) .
The proliferation rate of these cells was determined using a non-radioactive assay reagent ( Promega , CellTiter 96 AQ One ) and is expressed as absorbance at 490 nm .
( b ) EMSA of GAS-binding factors .
The IL-2 starved normal and HTLV-I-immortalized T cells were either not treated ( NT ) or stimulated with PMA/PHA for the indicated times .
Nuclear extracts were isolated from these cells and analysed by EMSA using the FceyR1 GAS probe .
( c ) Supershift analyses of the GAS-binding factors .
EMSA was performed in the presence of the indicated preimmune or immune sera using nuclear extracts of either stimulated normal T cells ( PMA/PHA , 8 h ) or untreated HTLV-I immortalized T cells expression and function of STATS and STAT3 transcription factors ( Lin et al. , 1995 ) .
These factors activate target genes driven by the GAS enhancer element , thus contributing to IL-2-induced cell proliferation .
Infection of T cells with HTLV-I is associated with an initial phase of IL-2-dependent polyclonal cell growth , which is believed to facilitate occurrence of secondary events allowing the infected cells to progress to an IL-2-independent stage .
The mechanism mediating the IL-2-independent growth of HTLV-I-transformed cells is elusive .
However , it is generally believed that deregulation of cellular transcription factors and abnormal induction of their target genes may play a role ( Ressler et al. , 1996 ) .
In this regard , recent studies have shown that the JAK/STAT system is constitutively activated in certain HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines ( Migone et al. , 1995 ; Takemoto et al. , 1997 ; Xu et al. , 1995 ) , thus suggesting that constitutive STAT activation may play a role in HTLV-I-induced IL-2-independent T-cell growth .
However , it has recently been shown that STAT activation does not occur in T cells transformed by HTLV-II ( an HTLV-I related virus ) or the Tax protein of HTLV-I ( Mulloy et al. , 1998 ) .
Even some of the HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines lack detectable JAK/STAT activity ( Mulloy et al. , 1998 and this study ) .
These findings suggest the involvement of additional mechanisms in HTLV-I-induced cell growth .
The NF- « xB/Rel enhancer binding proteins have also been implicated in the growth control of HTLV-I-transformed cells .
These factors are constitutively activated almost exclusively in HTLV-I- and Tax-transformed cells ( Ressler et a/. , 1996 ) .
Inhibition of NF-xB/Rel expression using specific antisense oligonu-cleotides potently interferes with the growth of tumor cells induced by both HTLV-I and Tax ( Kitajima et al. , 1992 ) .
It has not been defined how NF-xB/Rel participates in the growth control of HTLV-I-transformed cells .
A known mechanism for c-Rel-induced normal T-cell proliferation is the induction of IL-2 and its high affinity receptor ( Kontgen et al. , 1995 ) , which in turn triggers the activation of various growth-regulatory factors , including STATS .
However , except during the early stage , the HTLV-I-transformed T cells usually do not produce IL-2 nor require IL-2 for growth ( Hollsberg et al. , 1992 ; Uchiyama , 1997 ) .
Our data may suggest a potential mechanism by which NF-xB/Rel participates in the control of IL-2-independent T-cell growth .
We have demonstrated that certain NF-xB/Rel members , especially c-Rel , are able to functionally interact with target enhancers ( GAS ) of STATS .
Remarkably , c-Rel serves as a predominant GAS-binding factor in a number of HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines analysed .
Because of the contribution of c-Rel , the GAS site is constitutively occupied in all these HTLV-I-transformed cell lines , even though STATS and STAT3 are only activated in some of them ( Figure 1 ) .
These results are in agreement with a recent protein structural study , which demonstrates that STAT and the Rel proteins share striking structural similarity even though they have no obvious sequence homology ( Becker et a/. , 1998 ) .
However , it is suggested that STAT and Rel proteins differ in their DNA binding constants , which are in the nanomolar and picomolar ranges for STAT 's and Rel proteins , respectively ( Becker et al. , 1998 ) .
Our Functional binding of c-Rel to STATS target sequences SC Sun et al competition assays also show that c-Rel appears to have higher affinity to the IL-2R « xB site compared to its binding affinity to the FeyR1 GAS sequence ( Figure 4c ) .
Nevertheless , the binding of c-Rel to the GAS enhancer is functional since c-Rel potently activates a luciferase reporter gene driven by the FoyR1l GAS in transiently transfected cells ( Figure 5b ) .
Given its abundant expression in HTLV-I-transformed T cells , c-Rel may participate in the activation of certain STATS target genes in these virus-infected cells .
A recent study suggests that STAT6 physically interacts with the p50 and RelA subunits of NF-xB and functionally cooperate with NF-xB in IL-4-induced transcription ( Shen and Stavnezer , 1998 ) .
However , we have not been able to detect interaction between c-Rel and STATS using either co-immunopre-cipitation or antibody supershift assays ( Figure 6¢ and data not shown ) .
Of course , our data can not exclude the possibility that these two growth-related transcription factors function cooperatively on certain gene promoters .
Materials and methods Cells and culture conditions Human Jurkat leukemic T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , and antibiotics ( complete RPMI ) .
Murine HT2 cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 25 units of human recombinant IL-2 ( Biological Resources Branch , NCI ) and 55 um fB-mercaptoethanol .
F9 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in Iscove 's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , and antibiotics ( complete Iscove 's medium ) .
C8166 ( Salahuddin et a/. , 1983 ) , HUTI02 ( Gazdar et al. , 1980 ) , MT-2 ( Miyoshi et a/. , 1981 ) and SLB-1 ( Koeffler et al. , 1984 ) are HTLV-I-transformed human T-cell lines , which proliferate independent of IL-2 .
The C8166 , HUTI102 and MT-2 cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium , and the SLB-1 cells were maintained in complete Iscove 's medium .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were prepared from T-cell enriched human blood ( Biological Specialty Corporation , Colmar ) with a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient ( Pharmacia Biotech ) .
The cells were stimulated for 36 h with phytohemaglutinin ( PHA , 2 ug/ml ! )
and then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , antibiotics and 25 units/ml of human recombinant IL-2 .
Under these conditions , PBMC usually continuously grew for 2-4 weeks in the presence of exogenous IL-2 .
Proliferating T cells were isolated from the PBMC by negative selection using the Enrichment Immunecolums ( Biotex Laboratories Inc. , Edmonton , Alberta ) .
For obtaining resting PBMC or T cells , the cells were washed twice with RPMI lacking IL-2 followed by incubating the cells in the same medium for 24-30 h. In vitro immortalization of T cells with HTLV-I In vitro immortalization of T cells with HTLV-I was performed as previously described ( Merl et al. , 1984 ; Persaud et al. , 1995 ) .
Briefly , PHA-stimulated PBMC was cocultured with y-irradiated HTLV-I donor cells ( MT-2 ) in the IL-2-containing RPMI medium .
The cells were diluted when the medium become acidic ( as indicated by its color change ) .
As controls , PBMC and y-irradiated MT-2 cells were cultured separately under the same conditions .
As 1407 Functional binding of c-Rel to STATS target sequences SC Sun et al 1408 expected ( Merl et al. , 1984 ; Persaud et al. , 1995 ) , immortalized T cells started dominating the PBMC/MT-2 coculture after 4-5 weeks .
These immortalized cells were continuously proliferating when exogenous IL-2 was provided , a characteristic of T cells at early stage of HTLV-I infection ( Feuer and Chen , 1992 ; Sodroski , 1992 ) .
Under the same culturing conditions , the uninfected control PBMC usually cease growth between 2-4 weeks , and the y-irradiated MT-2 cells never grew ( data not shown ) .
The HTLV-I-immortalized T cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with IL-2 and used as bulk population after about 4 months .
Normal T cells were collected after 1-2 weeks of cultivation and frozen in RPMI supplemented with 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide until use .
To re-start the culture , the frozen cells were washed once with RPMI medium and then cultured in the same medium supplemented with IL-2 .
Nuclear extract preparation and electrophoresis mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) Normal human peripheral blood T cells and HTLV-I-immortalized T cells were starved for 30 h in RPMI growth medium lacking exogenous IL-2 .
The cells were either not treated or incubated with PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )
plus PHA ( 1 ug/ ml ) for the indicated times and then subjected to nuclear extract preparation .
Jurkat , HT2 and IL-2-independent HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines were collected directly from their culturing media .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from these cells as previously described ( Schreiber et a/. , 1989 ) .
Human 293 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran ( Holbrook et al. , 1987 ) with cDNA expression vectors encoding the wildtype or mutant forms of c-Rel ( Doerre et al. , 1993 ) and collected for nuclear extract preparation 40 h after transfection .
EMSA was performed by incubating nuclear extracts isolated from the various cell types ( ~10 ug for untransfected T cells and ~5 ug for transfected 293 cells ) with P-radiolabeled wildtype FoyR1 STAT probe ( Figure 3a , FeyRIWT ) at room temperature for 10 min followed by resolving the DNA-protein References Akagi T , Ono H , Nyunoya H and Shimotohno K.

For antibody 'supershift ' assays , 0.5 ul of antisera for NF- « xB or STAT proteins ( Santa Cruz , Inc. ) were added to the EMSA reaction 5 min before electro-phoresis .
Competition assays were performed by including excess unlabeled double stranded oligonucleotide probes in the reaction .
Oligonucleotide probes used in EMSA and competition assays are indicated in Figure 4a .
Luciferase reporter gene assays F9 cells were seeded onto 0.1 % gelatin-treated , 24-well plates ( 5 x 10* cells/well ) 1 day before transfection .
The cells were transfected using LIPOFECTAMINE '' Y '' reagent ( Gibco BRL ) with one ug of a luciferase reporter driven by the FeyRI STAT enhancer ( GRR-STAT-Luc , ref .
Nakajima et al. , 1996 ) along with 0.125 ug of cDNA expression vectors encoding wildtype or truncated forms of c-Rel or RelA .
Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity ( Promega ) 40-48 h after transfection .
Cell proliferation assays Normal or HTLV-I-infected human T cells were starved for 30 h in RPMI media lacking IL-2 .
The cells were aliquoted into a 96-well plate and either not treated or stimulated with PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) plus PHA ( 1 ug/ml ) .
After 24-72 h , proliferation of the cells were determined by incubating the cells with a non-radioactive proliferation assay reagent ( Promega , CellTiter 96 AQ One ) for about 1 h followed by measuring the absorbance at 490nm using an ELISA plate reader .
