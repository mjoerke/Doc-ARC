) , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Mass Abstract Background-Adhesion molecule expression on the endothelial cell ( EC ) surface is critical for leukocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions .
Better understanding of transcriptional regulation of adhesion molecules in ECs may provide important insight into plaque formation .
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a ( PPARa ) , a member of the nuclear receptor family , regulates gene expression in response to certain fatty acids and fibric acid derivatives .
The present study investigated PPARa expression in human ECs and their regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) .
Methods and Results-Immunohistochemistry revealed that human carotid artery ECs express PPARa , .
Pretreatment of cultured human ECs with the PPARa activators fenofibrate or WY14643 inhibited TNF-a-induced VCAM-1 in a time-and concentration-dependent manner , an effect not seen with PPARy activators .
Both PPARa activators decreased cytokine-induced VCAM-1 mRNA expression without altering its mRNA half-life .
Transient transfection of deletional VCAM-1 promoter constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that fenofibrate inhibits VCAM-1 transcription in part by inhibiting NF-xB .
Finally , PPARa activators significantly reduced adhesion of U937 cells to cultured human ECs .
Conclusions-Human ECs express PPARa , a potentially important regulator of atherogenesis through its transcriptional control of VCAM-1 gene expression .
Such findings also have implications regarding the clinical use of lipid-lowering agents , like fibric acids , which can activate PPARa .

Methods Page 2 Adhesion of circulating leukocytes to the endothelium is a critical early step in atherogenesis .
'~ '' This process depends on the interaction between adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell ( EC ) surface and their cognate ligands on leukocytes .
These EC adhesion molecules include vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) , E-selectin , and P-selectin . '' ''
Increased adhesion molecule expression by ECs in human atherosclerotic lesions may contribute to further leukocyte recruitment to sites of atherosclerosis . ''
Although inducers of EC adhesion molecule expression , such as the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -a and interleukin ( IL ) -1 , '° have received much attention , less is known about the negative regulation of adhesion molecule transcription .
Such understanding may provide important insight into plaque formation .
Certain polyunsaturated fatty acids , for example , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , can inhibit cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression in ECs , although the underlying mechanism remains unclear . '' '
Interestingly , some polyunsaturated fatty acids can activate the peroxisome proliferator , activated receptor-a ( PPARa ) , a nuclear receptor involved with transcriptional responses to fatty acids .
Fibric acid derivatives , such as fenofibrate , are also thought to act as specific activators for PPARa .
'~ '' * In addition to PPARa , the PPAR family also includes PPARy and PPARS .
PPARs , activated by binding of specific agonists , form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor and associate with PPAR response elements in the promoter region of target genes whose expression they regulate. ! ''
We have demonstrated expression of PPAR in human ECs and identified plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 as a potential PPARy target gene in these cells. ! ''
Although PPARa mRNA expression in human ECs has been reported , `` '' its role in EC biology , including candidate target genes , remains essentially unexplored .
We hypothesized that PPARa might regulate VCAM-1 expression in human ECs , thus potentially modulating leukocyte adhesion .
To this end , we investigated the presence of PPARa in human ECs , studying the effect of well-established PPARa and PPARy activators on adhesion molecule expression in these cells .
Immunohistochemistry of Human Carotid Artery Specimens Staining for PPARa was performed on acetone-fixed serial cryostat sections of human carotid arteries ( protocols approved by Brigham and Women 's Institutional Review Board ) with a polyclonal goat anti-human PPARa antibody ( Santa Cruz ) .
ECs were identified by staining with anti-CD31 antibodies ( Dako ) .
Sections were blocked with PBS/5 % serum , and incubated with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody ( Vector Laboratories ) , then avidin-biotinperoxidase complex ( Vectastain ABC kit ) .
Antibody binding was visualized with True Blue peroxidase substrate ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories ) and counterstained with Gill 's hematoxylin or contrast red ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories ) .

Page 3 Cell Culture Human saphenous vein ECs were isolated from explants from unused portions of saphenous veins harvested at coronary artery bypass surgery .
Cells , cultured as described before , '' !
were > 99 % von Willebrand factor-positive by flow cytometry , exhibited typical EC cobblestone growth pattern , and were of low passage number ( p2-5 ) .
Bovine aortic ECs ( BAECs ) and human fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM ( Biowhittaker ) containing 1 % glutamine , 1 % penicillin-streptomycin , and 10 % FCS .
The hematopoietic cell line U937 was cultured in RPMI medium ( Biowhittaker ) containing 1 % glutamine , 1 % penicillin-streptomycin , and 10 % FCS .
Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Extracts and Western Blot Analysis For Western blotting , nuclear and cytosolic extracts of 10 '' cells were prepared as previously Processed samples were applied to 10 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Millipore ) by use of semidry blotting . ''
Membranes were treated overnight with TBS-Tween/5 % dry milk and incubated with goat anti-human PPARa antibodies ( Santa Cruz ) for 1 hour .
After washing , membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase- conjugated rabbit anti-goat monoclonal antibodies .
Antigen detection was performed via chemiluminescence ( NEN ) ; Nuclear extracts from human fibroblasts transfected with a PPARa expression construct ( provided by Dr Bruce Spiegelman , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , Mass ) served as a positive control .
Cell-Surface Enzyme Immunoassays For determination of cell-surface expression of adhesion molecules , ECs were pretreated with PPAR activators [ PPARa activators : fenofibrate ( Sigma ) and WY 14643 ( Biomol ) ; PPARy activators : 15-deoxy-~ ' > '*-prostaglandin J ; ( 15d-PGJ ; ) ( Calbiochem ) , troglitazone ( Parke-Davis ) , and BRL 49653 ( SmithKline Beecham ) ] at the times and concentrations indicated and then stimulated with the specified cytokines ( 8 hours ) .
Enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) was performed by incubating EC monolayers first with specific monoclonal antibodies against VCAM-1 ( E1/6 ) , ICAM-1 ( HU5/3 ) , or E-selectin ( H18/7 ) , then with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG ( Vector Laboratories ) , and finally with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase ( Zymed Laboratories ) .
( All monoclonal antibodies were a generous gift from Dr Michael Gimbrone , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , Mass ) .
Cells were washed in PBS/1 % BSA after each incubation step , and the integrity of the cellular monolayer was ensured by phase-contrast microscopy .
Surface expression of each adhesion molecule was measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm 15 to 30 minutes after addition of the chromogenic substrate ( para-nitrophenylphosphate , Sigma ) .
Experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition .
Adhesion Assay ECs were grown to confluence in 96-well plates , pretreated with PPARa activators for 24 hours , and stimulated with TNF-a for 8 hours , then adhesion assays were performed .
'* Briefly , U937 cells were labeled with 2',7 '' -bis ( 2-carboxy ) -fluorescein acetoxymethyl ester ( Molecular Probes ) and then added , under rolling conditions ( 63 rpm , 23°C , 15 minutes ) , to a rinsed EC monolayer ( 210° cells/mL ) in RPMI medium/10 % FCS/1 mmol/L CaCl » .

Page 4 Nonadherent cells were removed by inverting the plate under rotation ( 20 minutes ) .
After solubilization of well contents , fluorescence intensity was measured in a microtiter plate fluorimeter ( Pandex , FCA ) .
A standard curve using dilutions of labeled U937 cells was determined , and results were expressed as cells/cm .
RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis For Northern blot experiments , human ECs were pretreated with PPARa activators for 24 hours and then stimulated with the specified cytokines for 3 hours .
Total RNA ( 10 '' cells ) was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method ( RNAzol , Tel-Test ) and 5 ug of RNA used in standard Northern blot analysis with a VCAM-1 probe .
VCAM-1 mRNA half-life was determined by stimulating ECs with TNF-a for 3 hours before blocking transcription by treatment with actinomycin D 5 ug/L .
Cells then received fenofibrate for the times indicated ; mRNA levels were compared with those of untreated cells .
Transient Transfections To investigate the effect of PPARa activators on VCAM-1 promoter activity , we transiently transfected BAECs with a series of deletional VCAM-1 promoter constructs , all containing the chloramphenicol acetylItransferase ( CAT ) reporter . ''
[ -755 ] FO.CAT is the putative full-length human VCAM-1 promoter containing AP-1 , GATA , and binding sites .
[ -28JF3.CAT lacks the AP-1 and GATA sites but retains NF-xB binding sites .
[ -44 ] F4.CAT lacks NF-xB binding sites ( Figure 5A ) .
BAECs , which are more easily transfectable than human ECs , were cotransfected via calcium phosphate precipitation '' with each reporter construct ( 5 ug ) and a pCMV.B-GAL ( 4 ug ) as an internal control .
Cells were stimulated ( 48 hours after transfection ) with TNF-a 10 ug/L with or without fenofibrate 100 umol/L .
BAECs were then harvested after 36 hours , and lysates were subjected to CAT and B-galactosidase assay ( Tropix ) as described . ''
Normalized CAT activity was calculated as the ratio of CAT activity to B-galactosidase activity .
Results for each reporter construct were expressed as multiples of induction compared with transfected , unstimulated cells .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay For electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) , human ECs were preincubated for 24 hours with fenofibrate 100 umol/L and then stimulated for 2 hours with TNF-a 10 ug/L before nuclear extracts were prepared .
The NF- « B oligonucleotide ( CCTGGGTTTCCCCT-TGAAGGGATTTCCCTCC ) ( Genosys Biotechnologies ) spanning the 2 tandem NF-KB sites ( as underlined above ) in the human VCAM-1 promoter was end-labeled with [ y- '' P ] JATP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs ) and purified ( Sephadex G-25 columns , Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology ) .
Nuclear extracts ( 5 ug ) were incubated with the labeled NF- « B oligonucleotide under standard conditions . '' ''
In the indicated experiments , nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-p50 [ polyclonal rabbit anti-p50 ( NLS ) X , Santa Cruz ] or anti-p65 ( polyclonal rabbit anti-p65 AX , Santa Cruz ) or nonspecific IgG before the addition of radiolabeled NF-KB probes .
DNA-protein complexes were electrophoretically separated ( 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel ) .

Assessment of Total Protein Synthesis Total protein synthesis was assessed as incorporation as described previously . `` !
Statistical Analysis Results Results of the experimental studies are reported as mean+SEM .
Differences were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA followed by Fisher 's protected least significant difference test .
A value of P < 0.05 was regarded as significant .
Human ECs Express PPARa In Vivo and In Vitro Immunohistochemistry of human carotid artery specimens ( n=6 ) revealed PPARa staining in the EC nuclei ( Figure 1A ; blue staining , arrowheads ) .
Parallel sections stained with goat IgG showed no immunostaining ( Figure 1B ) .
ECs were identified by immunoreactive CD31 ( platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ) in parallel sections ( Figure 1C ; red staining ) .
To demonstrate PPARa expression in vitro in a homogeneous population of human ECs , Western blot analysis of cultured human saphenous vein ECs was performed .
Consistent with the in situ findings , PPARa protein was detected in nuclear but not cytosolic fractions .
The identity of the detected band was confirmed by comigration with a band from fibroblasts transfected with a PPARa expression construct ( Figure 1D ) ; untransfected fibroblasts reveal no such band ( data not shown ) .
PPARa but Not PPARy Activators Reduce EC Surface Expression of VCAM-1 As expected , cell surface EIAs of human ECs revealed a marked increase of VCAM-1 expression in response to stimulation with TNF-a 10 sg/L .
Pretreatment of ECs with the PPARa activator fenofibrate 100 smol/L or WY14643 250 smol/L reduced VCAM-1 expression levels significantly , to 33+9 % ( P < 0.01 ) or 52+2 % ( P < 0.01 ) of TNF-a-stimulated cells , respectively ( Figure 2A ) .
Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry ( data not shown ) .
None of 3 different PPARy activators ( troglitazone , 10 smol/L ; 15d-PGJ ; , 10 smol/L ; or BRLA9653 , 10 smol/L ) ; significantly affected TNF-a-induced VCAM-1 expression ( Figure 2A ) .
Treatment of unstimulated human ECs with PPARa or PPARy activators did not alter VCAM-1 expression ( data not shown ) .
Fenofibrate did not affect EC viability ( > 95 % excluded trypan blue ) or total protein synthesis ( 263+5x 10° epm/cm > well in TNF-a-treated cells versus 283+22x10° well in TNF-a- and fenofibrate-treated cells ; P=NS ) .
Neither PPARa nor PPARy activators significantly reduced the TNF-a-induced cell surface expression of ICAM-1 ( Figure 2B , solid bars ) or E-selectin ( Figure 2B , open bars ) in ECs .

Page 6 Fenofibrate Reduces Cytokine-Induced VCAM-1 Expression in a Time- and Concentration-Dependent Manner To investigate the time- and concentration-dependence of PPARa activator treatment on VCAM-1 expression , human ECs were pretreated with fenofibrate for different times or concentrations before stimulation with TNF-a and subsequent EIA determination of VCAM-1 expression .
Inhibition of TNF-a-induced VCAM-1 expression depended on the time of fenofibrate exposure , with a maximal reduction after 24 hours of fenofibrate pretreatment ( Figure 2C ) .
In addition , fenofibrate inhibited VCAM-1 expression in human ECs induced by TNF-a ( Figure 2D , solid bars ) or IL-1a ( Figure 2D , open bars ) in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal reduction at 100 umol/L fenofibrate .
PPARa Activators Inhibit the Adhesion of Monocyte-Like Cells on Human ECs To investigate the potential functional relevance of PPARa activator-reduced VCAM-1 expression in human ECs , we performed an in vitro adhesion assay using fluorescently labeled U937 cells and monolayers of human ECs .
Stimulation of the EC monolayer with TNF-a increased the number of adherent cells from 9.1+1.5x10° cells/cm '' to 73.2+2.4x10° cells/cm ( P < 0.01 ) ( Figure 3B ) .
Pretreatment of EC 's with fenofibrate or WY 14643 before TNF-a stimulation reduced U937 cell adhesion significantly , to 36.7+2.2x10° cells/cm ( P < 0.01 ) or 37.3+4.3x10° cells/cm '' ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively ( Figure3A and 3B ) .
Preincubation of TNF-a-stimulated ECs with blocking anti- VCAM monoclonal antibody inhibited U937 cell adhesion almost completely ( data not shown ) .
PPARa Activators Reduce Cytokine-Induced VCAM-1 mRNA Levels in Human ECs Northern blot analysis revealed increased VCAM-1 mRNA levels after 3 hours of stimulation of human ECs with TNF-a 10 ug/L , which could be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by pretreatment with the PPARa activators fenofibrate or WY14643 ( Figure 4A ) .
Similar results were seen when ECs were stimulated with IL-1a instead of TNF-a ( data not shown ) .
In the presence of actinomycin D , fenofibrate did not significantly reduce VCAM-1 mRNA half-life compared with control cells ( 6.4+0.6 hours in control cells versus 6.4+1.1 hours in fenofibrate-stimulated cells , P=NS ) , indicating that the inhibitory effect of PPARa activators on VCAM-1 does not result from altered mRNA stability ( Figure 4B ) .
Fenofibrate Inhibits TNF-a-Induced VCAM-1 Promoter Activity To determine potential sites of interaction of PPARa activators with the VCAM-1 promoter , we performed transient transfections of various deletional VCAM-1 promoter reporter CAT constructs in bovine ECs ( Figure 5A ) .
After stimulation for 36 hours , CAT activity , as well as the activity of a cotransfected B-galactosidase construct , was measured ( Figure 5B ) .
TNF-a stimulation of cells transfected with the full-length promoter construct ( FO ) led to a 5.9+1.6-fold increase in normalized promoter activity ( CAT/B-galactosidase activity ) .
Treatment with fenofibrate significantly reduced this response to 2.4+0.4-fold ( P < 0.05 compared with TNF-a-stimulated cells ) .
Transfection studies with a VCAM-1 promoter deletion construct ( F3 ) containing the 2 tandem NF- < B sites , but lacking the AP-1 and GATA sites , revealed similar PPARa agonist responsiveness .
Stimulation of transfected Circulation .

Page 7 cells with TNF-a enhanced relative CAT activity 3.4+0.6-fold ; treatment with fenofibrate significantly inhibited this increase to 1.4+0.2 ( P < 0.05 compared with TNF-a-stimulated cells ) .
Transfection studies with the VCAM-1 deletion construct ( F4 ) , lacking the 2 NF-xB sites , revealed no change in relative CAT activity after treatment with TNF-a or fenofibrate .
In the case of all constructs , treatment with fenofibrate alone had no effect on relative CAT activity compared with control , consistent with the absence of consensus PPAR response elements in the VCAM promoter .
Fenofibrate Inhibits a-Induced NF-xB Activation EMSAs that used radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the 2 tandem NF-B sites in the VCAM-1 promoter were performed to investigate whether PPARa activators inhibit NF- < B activation .
Fenofibrate decreased the amount of shifted complexes induced by TNF-a , which suggests that PPARa , activators directly inhibit NF-xB activation ( Figure 5C ) .
To further investigate these findings , supershift analysis was performed to define fenofibrate effects on the NF-KB transcriptional complex ( Figure 5C ) .
As described by others , TNF-a-induced NF-KB activation involves the p50 and p65 subunits .
Fenofibrate treatment of similarly stimulated ECs resulted in a parallel decrease in the amount of supershifted p50 and p65 complexes .
Discussion The present study reports expression of PPARa in ECs of human arteries and reduction of cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression by PPARa agonists through inhibition of NF-B .
This inhibition of VCAM-1 expression by PPARa activators decreased adhesion of monocyte-like cells to stimulated ECs .
PPARy activators exhibited no such effects .
Initially , PPARa was thought to be limited to tissues such as liver and fat , in which it participates in the regulation of lipid , and in particular fatty acid , metabolism . ''
A recent study demonstrated PPARa expression in human vascular smooth muscle cells with inhibition of IL-6 , cyclooxygenase- 2 , and prostaglandin gene expression by the same PPARa activators used here ( W Y14643 , fenofibrate ) . '' ''
Human ECs , like vascular smooth muscle cells , express both PPARa and '* with each PPAR probably having unique effects relevant to vascular biology in these cellular settings .
We have previously shown PPARy expression in ECs and suggested a role of PPAR in the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene expression . '' ''
We report here that PPARy activation does not appear to be involved in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression ( Figure 2 ) .
In contrast , 2 different established PPARa activators , fenofibrate and WY 14643 , inhibit cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression in ECs .
These agents probably act in ECs by activating PPARa , .
Both of these agonists have high binding affinities to PPARa while selectively interacting with PPARa , with little to no activity on other PPAR isoforms .
' > 25 The fibrates used here produced inhibitory effects at concentrations similar to those that induced established PPARa response genes , eg , apolipoprotein A-IL .
* '' In contrast , various PPARy activators , among them the highly specific PPARy agonist BRLA9653 , ' > ° added either before or after ( data not shown ) cytokine treatment , had no effect on VCAM-1 levels .

Page 8 Therefore , PPARy activation by PPARa agonists seems an unlikely explanation for our results .
The reduction of VCAM-1 expression by PPARa activators appears at a transcriptional level because fenofibrate did not alter VCAM-1 mRNA half-life but did inhibit TNF-a-induced VCAM-1 promoter activity .
This effect appears to stem from inhibition of NF- < B activation , as suggested by the reduction of CAT activity of the promoter construct lacking binding sites ( [ -44 ] F4 ) and gel shift assays .
The inhibition of NF-xB activation by PPARa could result from direct interference with NF-xB binding to the VCAM-1 promoter , as postulated for the interaction of NF-xB with the estrogen receptor . ''
Alternatively , the inhibitory effects might occur through competitive binding of transcriptional coactivators by PPARa or by PPARa-induced transcription factors .
Such `` negative crosstalk '' has been suggested between other nuclear receptors and the transcription factor AP-1. > ° In fact , one such coactivator , p300 , involved in VCAM-1 expression '' '' reportedly interacts with PPARa. > ' Our data also do not exclude a PPARa effect on IxB or an effect on the transcription of NF-xB subunits p30 and p65 .
The genes encoding ICAM-1 and E-selectin have NF-KB sites in their promoter ; nonetheless , PPARa activators did not alter ICAM-1 or E-selectin expression .
This result may be explained in several ways .
It could derive from the distinct nature of the VCAM-1 promoter , either its NF-xB sites or another undefined VCAM-1 transcriptional element , '' ie , the interferon regulatory factor-1 site .
We saw no effect of fenofibrate on the known TNF-a induction of interferon regulatory factor-1 expression in ECs ( data not shown ) . ''
Other mechanisms might include competition for transcriptional coactivators as described above .
Interestingly , retinoic acid , acting through the retinoic acid receptor , another nuclear receptor family member , also appears to inhibit activation of the NF-xB site of the VCAM-1 promoter , but not NF-xB activation of either the ICAM-1 or E-selectin promoters . ''
Inhibition of VCAM-1 expression in human ECs by PPARa activators , with a consequent decrease in monocyte adherence to ECs , has important implications regarding atherogenic mechanisms as well as the treatment of atherosclerosis , especially given the similarity of fenofibrate concentrations used here and those achieved in patients . '' ''
Human angiographic studies have reported that fenofibrate treatment reduces coronary artery stenoses . ''
Epidemiological '' ® as well as experimental work '' '' suggests that the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids , some of them also known PPARa agonists , ' > reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events .
Given the likely involvement of VCAM-1 in monocyte recruitment to early atherosclerotic lesions , our findings suggest PPARa as a potential mediator of critical inflammatory processes in the vessel wall .
