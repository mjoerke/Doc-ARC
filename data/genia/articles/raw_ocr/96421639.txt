However , the mechanisms involved in the activation of AP-1 by antioxidants are largely unknown .
In this study we show that the structurally unrelated antioxidant agents pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , butylated hydroxyanisole , and N-acetylcysteine activated JNK ( c-Jun NH , -terminal kinase ) in Jurkat T cells .
This activation differed substantially from that mediated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and Ca '' * ionophore or produced by costimulation with antibodies against the T cell receptor-CD3 complex and to CD28 .
The activation of JNK by classical T cell stimuli was transient , whereas that mediated by PDTC and butylated hydroxyanisole ( but not N-acetylcysteine ) was sustained .
The kinetics of JNK activation correlated with the expression of c-jun which was transient after stimulation with PMA plus ionophore and prolonged in response to PDTC , which also transiently induced c-fos .
In addition , JNK activation by PMA plus ionophore was sensitive to inhibitors of signaling pathways involving Ca* '' * , protein kinase C , and tyrosine phosphorylation , which failed to inhibit the activation mediated by PDTC .
Transfection of frans-dominant negative expression vectors of ras and raf , together with AP-l-dependent reporter constructs , as well as Western blot analysis using anti-ERK ( extracel-lular signal-regulated kinase ) antibodies , indicated that the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant .
However , the combined treatment with PDTC and PMA , two agents that synergize on AP-1 activation , resulted in the persistent phosphorylation of ERK-2 .
In conclusion , our results identify JNK as a target of antioxidant agents which can be regulated differentially under oxidant and antioxidant conditions .

Homodimers of members of the Jun family of transcription factors and heterodimers formed with these members and those of the Fos family comprise the AP-1 transcription factor , which binds to the TRE* site to regulate gene transcription ( 1 , 2 ) .
The capacity of AP-1 to respond to a wide array of extracellular signals is largely mediated by the transcription factors that regulate the c-fos and c-jun promoters whose binding and activity are in turn regulated through different signaling pathways ( 2-4 ) .
Thus , the major regulatory element within the c-fos promoter , the serum response element ( SRE ) , is recognized by a complex that contains the ternary complex factor ( TCF ) YElk-1 and the serum response factor ( 3 ) .
TCF/Elk-1 is phosphorylated rapidly in response to a variety of stimuli by the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 , which are activated by the Ras/Raf/ERK kinase cascade ( 4 , 5 ) .
The sequential activation and phosphorylation of ERK and TCF/EIk-1 facilitate the SRE ternary complex formation and the subsequent transcriptional induction of c-fos ( 6-8 ) .
Transcription of c-jun is activated by binding of preformed homodimers of c-Jun or heterodimers of c-Jun and ATF-2 to the TRE of the c-jun promoter .
Both transcription factors c-jun and ATF-2 are phosphorylated by another group of mitogen-activated protein kinases denominated JNKs/SAPKs ( c-Jun NH , -terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases ) ( 9-11 ) , which are activated early by upstream signal transduction pathways involving kinase cascades different from those regulating the ERKs ( 12 , 13 ) .
Although several growth factors stimulate the ERK pathway and induce c-fos involving the phosphorylation of TCF/Elk-1 , exposure of cells to stress induced by UV radiation ( 14 ) or by protein synthesis inhibitors ( 15 ) , which occurred with c-fos gene expression , did not involve activation of the ERK pathway .
Recently , studies on the mechanisms involved in TCF/ Elk-1 phosphorylation indicated that this factor is a point of convergence of mitogen-activated protein kinases/ERKs and JNK/SAPK signaling pathways , since JNKs/SAPKs can also phosphorylate TCF/EIk-1 in response to a variety of stimuli ( 13 , 16-19 ) .
Therefore , JNK activation itself could account for AP-1 activation , since TCF/EIk-1 , c-Jun , and ATF-2 , factors critically involved in the transcription of c-fos and c-jun , are targets that can be phosphorylated by this kinase .

The use of antioxidants with radical scavenger properties has evidenced a role for reactive oxygen intermediates , generated under prooxidant con-ditions , on the activation of NFB .
Thus , the activation of NFkB in response to oxidative stress is inhibited by several structurally unrelated antioxidants including dithiocarba-mates ( 21-24 ) , the antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin ( 23-25 ) , and the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine ( 21 , 26 , 27 ) .
AP-1 is also activated by a number of stimuli that generate oxidative stress ( 23 , 28-31 ) .
However , these antioxidants that block NFB activation efficiently paradoxically stimulate the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of AP-1 involving induction of the c-fos and c-jun mRNAs ( 23 , 24 , 32 ) and the transcriptional activation of the SRE ( 23 ) .
Therefore , signals triggered under both prooxidant and antioxidant conditions can lead to the activation of AP-1 .
To understand the mechanisms by which antioxidants activate AP-1 , we analyzed their effects on different signal transduction pathways involved in T cell activation .
We found that different antioxidant agents stimulate JNK activity .
Further-more , we studied the antioxidant-induced signaling in T lymphocytes using pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , a potent antioxidant agent that activates AP-1 .
Our results are discussed in the context of recent works that implicate JNK as a mediator in the activation of both c-fos and c-jun transcriptional expression .

The double-stranded oligonucleotide used as a probe in EMSAs , 5-GCCCCCTCTGACTCATGCTGACA-3 ' , included the -68 to -46 base pairs of the CD11Ic promoter ( 82 ) containing an AP-1 consensus site .
Transfection Experiments-Jurkat cells ( 10 '' ) were transfected with Lipofectin ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) as recommended by the manufac-turer .
Briefly , exponentially growing cells ( 8-7 X 10°/ml ) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline , resuspended in Opti-MEM ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with a mixture of 5 ug/ml plasmid DNA and 10 ug/ml Lipofectin in 1 ml of Opti-MEM .
Then , cells were diluted with 14 ml of complete medium ( RPMI and 10 % fetal bovine serum ) and incubated for 36 h. Cells were then treated with different stimuli for 12 additional h , collected by centrifugation , and luciferase activity was determined following instructions described in a luciferase assay kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
In cotransfection experiments with expression vectors , the same protocol was followed , but the reporter and expression plasmids were added at concentrations of 5 and 10 pg/ml , respectively , and the Lipofectin to 10 ug/ml .
Western Blot Analysis-Western blot was performed as described previously ( 89 ) with the following modifications .
Cells ( 10° ) were washed and lysed in 200 ul of buffer A ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.8 , 50 mM B-glycerophosphate , 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 0.5 % Triton X-100 , 2 mM MgCl , , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 2 ug/ml aprotinin , 2 ug/ml leupeptin , 3 nM okadaic acid ) .
After vortex , cells were kept on ice for 15 min and microcentrifuged for 15 min .
Supernatants were col-lected , mixed with loading buffer , and separated by 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and then incubated with blocking solution ( 5 % w/v skim milk TBS-T ( TBS , 0.05 % Tween 20 ) ) for 60 min at 45 °C , washed three times in TBS-T , and incubated with anti-ERK 1 , 2 ( Zymed , San Francisco ) 0.1 % v/v in TBS-T , 5 % w/v skim milk .
Then , membranes were washed six times for 5 min each in 0.5 % w/v skim milk in TBS-T , and peroxi-dase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG ( ICN ) ( 0.1 % v/v in TBS-T ) was incubated for 60 min at room temperature .

GST-c-Jun protein was isolated from 250 ml of bacterial cells expressing pGEX-c-Jun , ; , , plasmid ( provided by Dr. R. Davis ) using GSH-Shepharose 4B beads ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) .
After electrophoresis , the gel was washed twice for 15 min in 100 ml of 20 % v/v 2-propanol , 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.6 , and then equilibrated with two 15-min changes of 100 ml of buffer A ( 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.6 , 5 mM B-mercaptoethanol ) .
Proteins were denatured by incubating the gel twice for 15 min in 100 ml of 6 M urea in buffer A at room temperature .
This was followed by four sequential renaturation steps ( 15 min each ) by discarding half of the volume ( 50 ml ) and replacing it with ice-cold renaturation buffer ( 0.05 % v/v Tween 20 in buffer A ) at 4°C .
After washing three or four times with 150 ml of renaturation buffer at 4 °C , the gel was immersed in 25 ml of kinase buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.6 , 20 mM MgCl , , 5 mM B-glycerophosphate , 0.1 mM sodium vanadate , 2 mM dithiothreitol ) for 30 min at 4°C and incubated further in 15 ml of kinase buffer containing 20 uM ATP and 100 uCi of [ y- '' '' P ] ATP at 30 °C for 1-2 h. Finally , the gel was washed four times with 150-200 ml of 5 % viv trichloroacetic acid and 1 % v/v sodium pyrophosphate at room temperature , dried , and exposed for 1-2 days .
RESULTS Changes in c-fos and c-jun mRNA Levels in Jurkat Cells Induced by PDTC-Since different antioxidant agents , including PDTC , activate AP-1 , we analyzed further the effect of PDTC on c-fos and c-jun mRNA steady state .
Kinetic experiments using total RNA from Jurkat cells treated with PDTC and from cells treated with the combination of the phorbol ester PMA and the Ca** ionophore A23187 , either pretreated or not with PDTC , were carried out ( Fig .
1A ) .
Incubation with PMA plus A23187 resulted in transient induction of both c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels , having maximal values at 30-60 min , whereas exposure to PDTC caused a prolonged expression of c-jun mRNA reaching maximal levels between 1 and 4 h and remained high for at least 10 h. PDTC induced a weaker 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Antioxidants Activate JNK A - 0.25 0.5 10 40070 10 _ hours 0 o e » PMA +Io c-fos # & ® # # # PDTC © 0 @ o a # PMA+lo/PDTC - 0.25 0.5 1 4 7 10 hours @ @ @ @ # s a PrmMa+lo c-jun o 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 @ eo a ao ruamiororc - 0.25 0.5 1 4 7 10 hours o 0 0 0 0 0 a -- -B-actin 0 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 0 @ W B k a Ba o o ~ : 2 a a ~s Io Bo & & - wos on AP-1 PROBE Fic .

Strikingly , the incubation of Jurkat cells with PDTC prior to stimulation with PMA plus ionophore led to a prolonged induction not only of the c-jun mRNA levels , but also of the c-fos levels , which were , on the other hand , higher than those obtained with PDTC and PMA-ionophore separately .
As shown previously for other cell types ( 23 , 24 , 32 ) , EMSA using nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells and a consensus AP-1 probe confirmed that PDTC ( and PMA-ionophore ) induced AP-1 DNA binding activity ( Fig .
1B ) and TRE-dependent transcriptional activation ( Fig .
2 ) .

Roles of Ras and Raf on the AP-1 trans-activation mediated by PDTC .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected by lipofection with 5 ug/ml luciferase-based plasmids directed by the AP-l-responsive ( -78/+63 base pairs ) sequence of the collagenase promoter ( -78colliuc ) ( panels A and B ) or by the IL-2 promoter ( IL-2Luc ) ( panels C and D ) together with 10 ug/ml expression vectors of the frans-dominant negative forms of ras ( panels A and C ) and rof ( panels B and D ) or its parental empty vector , pEFBOS , for 12 h. 36 h post-transfection cells were treated with 50 um PDTC or 20 ng/ml PMA plus 1 um A28187 for an additional 12 h. The results are expressed as relative light units ( R.L.U ) measured for 30 s. Results are representative of three independent experiments .
transient expression of c-fos , a strong and prolonged expression of c-jun , and a durable activation of both c-fos and c-jun triggered by PMA plus ionophore .
Effect of PDTC on the Ras/ERK Pathway-The Ras/ERK pathway is a common route that serves multiple extracellular signals that activate the SRE of the c-fos promoter ( 4 , 5 ) .
Since the SRE has been shown to act as a primary antioxidant responsive element that can be activated by PDTC ( 23 ) , we analyzed whether the activation of AP-1 by this antioxidant was mediated through activation of this pathway in Jurkat T cells .
As shown in Fig .
24 , the activation of an AP-1 reporter construct ( -73colLue ) in response to PDTC was not affected by the expression of a dominant negative ras , c-Ha-ras N17 ( Fig .
2A ) .
The efficient expression of the ras construct was confirmed in parallel cotransfections , where expression of c-Ha-ras N17 caused a severe transcriptional inhibition of both a luciferase plasmid directed by the human IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
2C ) and the AP-1 reporter plasmid in response to PMA plus ionophore ( data not shown ) .
Similar experiments were performed to analyze whether Raf-1 kinase was required for the activation of AP-1 induced by PDTC .
AP-1 frans-activation by the antioxidant was not significantly affected by the expression of a trans-dominant negative mutant of Raf-l1 kinase ( Fig .
2B ) which efficiently inhibited the IL-2Luc frans-activation , as well as the AP-1Luc trans-activation by PMA plus ionophore ( Fig .
2D and data not shown ) .
To explore whether the signals elicited by PDTC affected ERK activity , we performed Western blot analysis using anti-Erk-1 , -2 antibodies to detect any possible decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of ERKs which would be indicative of its activation ( 41 ) .
PDTC failed to modify the mobility of ERK-2 , which appears to be the predominant ERK isoform 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 26338 A 2 min 5 min 15 min 30 min I A % p42 C -all mpm » PDTC £ 5 min £ an a £ E £ o r w= a =t w Led « I pC m9 ¥ zea a & osi PA £5 : s s z 1 € 5 a & = z ® o u » 0 a bu p42C , .

Effects of PDTC and PMA on ERK activity and PAC-1 gene expression .
Panel A , Western blot analysis of total lysates from Jurkat cells ( 10° ) incubated with 50 um PDTC , 20 ng/ml PMA , or preincubated with 50 um PDTC for 2 h and then treated with 20 ng/ml PMA for the times indicated .
A monoclonal antibody against ERK-1 and ERK-2 was used .
The electrophoretic mobility of the upper and lower bands corresponded to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated bands of ERK-2 , respectively .
Panel B , total cytoplasmic RNAs ( 10 ug ) from Jurkat cells treated as described in panel A were prepared at different times of treatment and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a probe specific for PAC-1 .
expressed by Jurkat cells ( Fig .
34 ) .
As expected , PMA caused a very rapid transient shift in the mobility of ERK-2 which was detected as early as 30 s and declined after 1 h of treatment ( Fig .
3A ) .
Interestingly , when Jurkat cells were pretreated with PDTC and stimulated further with PMA , ERK-2 persisted in its activated form after 24 h of treatment ( Fig .
3A ) .
The persistent phosphorylation of ERK-2 observed might be due to an inhibition of the PAC-1 T cell phosphatase , which has been shown to dephosphorylate ERK-2 in vivo ( 34 , 42 ) .
However , Northern blot analysis indicated that mRNA steady-state levels of PAC-1 , induced early by PMA , were not significantly affected by previous treatment with PDTC after 90 and 180 min ( Fig .
3B ) when a complete activation of ERK-2 was found in cotreated cells ( Fig .
3A ) .
Taken together , our results indicated that the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant PDTC .
In addition , the combined treatment of PDTC and PMA , which has been shown to synergize on AP-1-dependent trans-activation ( 23 , 24 ) caused a persistent phosphorylation of ERK-2 by mechanisms different from the inhibition of the gene expression of PAC-1 .
Activation of JNK by Antioxidants-Signals leading to T cell activation by costimulation with phorbol ester and Ca** ionophore or by agonistic antibodies to the T cell receptor-CD3 complex and to CD28 involve the activation of JNKs ( 48 ) .
Besides the ability to phosphorylate c-Jun ( 40 ) , JNKs have recently been shown to phosphorylate ATF-2 ( 11 , 44 , 45 ) and TCF-Elk-1 ( 16-19 ) .
Thus , JNKs phosphorylate factors involved in the activation of AP-1 not only by regulating c-jun but also by c-fos transcription .
Therefore , we decided to determine whether PDTC affected the activity of JNKs , a mechanism that could account for the observed c-fos and c-jun activation in the apparent absence of ERK activation .
In-gel kinase assays of GST-c-Jun , _ ; , , revealed activation of the 46- and 55-kDa forms of JNK in extracts of Jurkat cells treated with PDTC ( Fig .

Activation of JNK by antioxidants and T cell stimuli .
In-gel kinase assay performed with whole-cell extracts from Jurkat cells ( 10° ) treated with 20 ng/ml PMA plus 1 um A23187 ( P+J0 ) , or 100 uM PDTC ( panel A ) , 10 pg/ml anti-CD3 plus 2 ug/ml anti-CD28 ( panel B ) , 50 mM N-acetylcysteine ( NAC , panel C ) , and 50 uM BHA ( panel D ) for the times indicated .
Controls from untreated and PMA plus iono-phore-treated cells are included in each experiment to compare the relative induction obtained with the different antioxidants .
Whole-cell extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a gel polymerized in the presence of GST-c-Jun , _ ; , .
After a denaturation-renaturation process , the gel was incubated with [ y-° ] ATP , washed extensively , and exposed .
The bands corresponding to the 46- and 55-kDa JNK forms are indicated by arrowheads .
vation of JNK ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) , PDTC exerted a prolonged activation of JNK which was maintained for at least 8 h ( Fig .
4A ) .
To determine whether the activation by PDTC was due to its antioxidant effect , we then analyzed the effects on JNK activity of two structurally unrelated antioxidants , N-acetylcysteine and BHA , which have been shown to increase AP-1 activity ( 23 , 24 ) .
Exposure of Jurkat cells to BHA resulted in a weak although sustained activation of JNK which persisted for more than 4 h ( Fig .
4D ) .
Treatment with N-acetylcysteine led , on the other hand , to a transient activation of JNK , although in this case it was even stronger than that mediated by PMA plus ionophore ( Fig .
4C ) .
Thus , signals triggered by different antioxidant agents that increase or activate AP-1 involve the activation of JNK .
Inhibitors of T Cell Activation Discriminate the Signaling Pathways of PDTC versus PMA plus Ionophore-To search for mechanisms involved in the activation of JNK by antioxidant agents , a panel of inhibitors that interfere with upstream signals involved in T cell activation was used .
Thus , inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases with herbimycin A resulted in significant inhibition of the JNK activation mediated by PMA plus ionophore ( Fig .
5A ) and by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies ( data not shown ) , but it did not interfere with that mediated by PDTC .
In addition , blockade of the Ca**/calcineurin signaling pathway with cyclosporin A , which has been shown to attenuate JNK activation in response to either PMA plus ionophore or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ( 43 ) , had no effect on PDTC-mediated JNK activation at the doses analyzed ( Fig .
5 , A and B , and data not shown ) .
Moreover , inhibition of PKC with bisindolylmaleimide ( 46 ) , which completely abrogated the activation of JNK induced by PMA plus ionophore ( Fig .
5A ) , had the opposite effect on the PDTC-mediated activation , resulting in increased JNK activity when bisindolylmaleimide was added ( Fig .
5B ) .
This effect , which was not observed either with extracts from cells treated with PMA plus ionophore , with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 cells , or with control cells pretreated with the PKC inhibitor ( Fig .
5A and data not shown ) , requires further study .
Nevertheless , the effect of bisindolylmaleimide clearly discriminates the signaling pathways induced by PDTC versus PMA plus ionophore .
Thus , the signals that converge in JNK activation mediated by PDTC appear to be distinct from those elicited 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Antioxidants Activate JNK A P+Io = `` _ BSM CsA Herb Hie < - 55 kDa = sal +- 46 kDa wa B PDTC 20 aM PDTC 100 M - P+Io = = BSM CsA Herb - BSM CsA Herb Fic .

In-gel kinase assays were performed with whole-cell extracts from Jurkat cells preincubated or not with 10 uM bisindolylmaleimide ( BSM ) , 100 ng/ml cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , or 800 nM herbimycin A ( Herb ) for 4 , 1 , and 12 h , respectively .
After preincubation , cells were treated with 20 ng/ml PMA plus 1 uM A23187 ( P+I0 ) for 15 min ( panel A ) or with 20 and 100 um PDTC for 2 h ( panel B ) .
Whole-cell extracts were then obtained , and an in-gel kinase assay of GST-c-Jun , _ ; , was performed .
The bands corresponding to the 55- and 46-kDa forms of JNK are indicated by arrowheads .
through stimulation of T cells with PMA plus ionophore or anti-CD3 plus CD28 .
DISCUSSION The physiological and pharmacological modifications of the cellular redox state provoke drastic changes in the activities of the transcription factors AP-1 and NFkB which play a central role in the regulation of the immune response .
NFB and AP-1 are affected differentially by signals generated by prooxidant and antioxidant agents ( 20 ) ; whereas NFkB is induced by a large number of T cell stimuli that cause reactive oxygen intermediate generation ( 20 , 47 ) , its activation is inhibited by different antioxidant agents with radical scavenger properties .
However , AP-1 is not only induced by a wide array of stimuli that generate oxidative stress ( 23 , 28-31 ) , but also by a number of antioxidant agents ( 23-25 , 32 ) .
In this study , we compared the signaling pathways through which antioxidants and T cell stimuli lead to the activation of AP-1 and identify JNK as a target activated by different antioxidant agents .
Although treatment of Jurkat T cells with either PMA plus ionophore or anti TCR/CD3 plus CD28 on one hand and with antioxidants on the other increases the activity of JNK , our data clearly indicate that the signal transduction mechanisms involved in both activations are different .
( i ) JNK activation by PDTC was refractory to inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases , protein kinase C , or Ca** signaling , whereas the JNK activation mediated by either T cell receptor-CD3/CD28 antibodies or PMA plus ionophore was inhibited to a variable extent by such inhibitors .
( ii ) TRE and IL-2 promoter-mediated frans-activation by PMA and ionophore was sensitive to the expression of trans-dominant negative versions of ras and raf which failed to inhibit the AP-1 trans-activation induced by PDTC .
( iii ) Transient phosphorylation of ERK-2 , detected at early times of activation with PMA , was not observed after treatment with PDTC .
Although the expression of c-Ha-ras N17 dominant negative did not affect the trans-activation of AP-1 by PDTC ( Fig .
24 ) , this was augmented by the expression of a constitutively active v-Ha-ras ( data not shown ) .
Since activated Ha-ras has been shown to partially activate JNK ( 10 ) , it is likely that the additional effect displayed by activated ras on the activation of AP-1 26339 by PDTC is mediated through JNK .
Hence , the Ras/RafERK pathway can modulate the PDTC-induced signaling to AP-1 , although it did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant .
An interesting feature of ERK regulation arising during the analysis of its phosphorylation in extracts of Jurkat cells cotreated with PMA and PDTC was the persistent activated state of ERK-2 .
Whether this prolonged activation is related to the synergism observed on the activation of AP-1 by both agents ( 23 , 24 ) remains to be investigated further .
Since PAC-1 is a phosphatase rapidly expressed after T cell activation which has been shown to inhibit ERK-2 phosphorylation and activation ( 34 , 42 ) , we have analyzed its involvement in the activation induced by PMA plus PDTC .
However , our studies on PAC-1 gene expression indicated that PAC-1 mRNA levels induced by PMA were not significantly affected by PDTC ( Fig .
3B ) .
Other explanations that could account for the constitutive activation of ERK include the possibility that PAC-1 phosphatase activity was post-transcriptionally inhibited by PDTC , or more likely , that other phosphatases could be inhibited by the antioxidant .
In this regard , the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 in T lymphocytes has recently been shown to block PMA-induced ERK activity and to inhibit IL-2 promoter-dependent transcription in response to PMA plus ionophore ( 48 ) .
Since mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 has also been shown to dephosphorylate JNK ( 49 ) , it will be of interest to study the activity and expression of this phosphatase in response to antioxidants .
In HeLa cells PDTC has been shown to induce c-fos and c-jun transcription ( 23 ) .
Although we have found induction of both c-fos and c-jun by PDTC in Jurkat cells , important kinetic differences are observed when both cell types are compared .
Thus , in Hela cells PDTC triggers c-fos gene expression faster than c-jun , with a transient induction in both cases ( 23 ) .
However , in Jurkat cells PDTC-mediated c-jun expression was prolonged and preceded that of c-fos .
Therefore , PDTC can operate by different mechanisms depending on the cell type analyzed .
The SRE within the c-fos promoter has been shown to act as a primary antioxidant element that can be activated by PDTC in Hela cells ( 23 ) .
However , as discussed above , the mechanisms by which the antioxidant acted in Jurkat cells does not appear to be mediated by the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway .
Hence , PDTC seems to be one of the stimuli that can induce c-fos in the absence of ERK activation .
Since JNK has been shown to phosphorylate TCF/EIk-1 , the major transcription factor involved in SRE activation , it is possible that PDTC can activate c-fos transcription through the phosphorylation of TCF by JNK .
Additional experiments , including in-gel kinase analysis of GST-EIk-1 in extracts of cells treated with antioxidants , will be required to elucidate this issue .
We have found that structurally unrelated antioxidant agents activate JNK in Jurkat T cells .
However , the kinetics and strength of this activation as well as the abilities to stimulate AP-1 displayed by the different antioxidants are different .
Thus , PDTC per se exerts a potent and prolonged JNK activation and activates both AP-1 DNA binding activity and the TRE-dependent trans-activation .
BHA displays a weak but sustained activation of JNK ; and N-acetylcysteine , which has been shown to induce AP-1 binding but not significant TRE trans-activation ( 23 ) , exerts a transient activation of JNK .
Moreover , N-acetylcysteine was the strongest antioxidant stimulating JNK .
Therefore , sustained activation of JNK appears to be a mechanism through which some antioxidants can operate , but it is not a general mechanism that mediates the signaling of all of the antioxidants .
Likewise , these results suggest that additional signaling , different from JNK activation , must be 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 26340 required to activate TRE-dependent transcription , since N-acetylcysteine , which is not able to activate it per se ( 23 , and data not shown ) , activates JNK in a fashion similar to that of PMA plus ionophore .
It is important to note that both prooxidant and antioxidant conditions lead to the activation of AP-1 .
JNK appears to be tuned differentially under both conditions .
Thus , it would be possible that those antioxidants that trigger sustained activation of JNK might elicit specific antioxidative responses through AP-l-regulated genes , subtly regulated by the duration and the strength of JNK stimulation .
In this regard , in PC12 cells the cellular responses elicited by growth factors which lead cells to proliferate or to differentiate seem to be determined by the transient or sustained activation of ERK , respectively ( 5 ) .
On the other hand , we have shown recently that several dithiocarbamates , including PDTC , trigger mye-loid differentiation involving the activation of AP-1 ( 32 ) .
Hence , it will be of the utmost interest to determine whether the duration of JNK activation is involved in selectively triggering these cellular responses .
Future experiments will be designed to identify the mechanisms by which antioxidants target JNK activity including their effects on the upstream signaling pathway components that activate JNK/SAPKs and on the phosphatases that regulate its phosphorylation .
These studies , which could also contribute to trace the signal transduction mechanisms involved in T lymphocyte activation , are currently in progress .
