* INSERM U 395 , Toulouse , France , and Louis Jeantet Laboratory of Molecular Genetics , Department of Genetics and Microbiology , University of Geneva Medical School , Geneva , Switzerland '' Received 1 March 1999/Accepted 14 May 1999 Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) , a betaherpesvirus , is a pathogen which escapes immune recognition through various mechanisms .
In this paper , we show that HCMV down regulates gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) -induced HLA-DR expression in U373 MG astrocytoma cells due to a defect downstream of STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation .
Repression of class II transactivator ( CIITA ) mRNA expression is detected within the first hours of IFN-y-HCMV coincubation and results in the absence of HLA-DR synthesis .
This defect leads to the absence of presentation of the major immediate-early protein IE1 to specific CD4* T-cell clones when U373 MG cells , used as antigen-presenting cells , are treated with IFN-y plus HCMV .
However , presentation of endogenously synthesized IE1 can be restored when U373 MG cells are transfected with CIHITA prior to infection with HCMV .
Altogether , the data indicate that the defect induced by HCMV resides in the activation of the IFN-y-responsive promoter of This is the first demonstration of a viral inhibition of CIITA expression .
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) , a betaherpesvirus , is pathogenic almost exclusively in immunocompromised individ-uals .
Cellular immune response is thought to control HCMV in immunocompetent people , both in the acute phase and in the latent infection which ensues ( for a review , see reference 6 ) .
Cytotoxic CD8* T cells contribute greatly to immunological control , as revealed by the presence of cytotoxic CD8 * T cells in patients who recover from acute infections ( 37 ) and by the prevention of HCMV disease following the injection of viral matrix-specific CD8 clones to bone marrow transplant patients ( 44 ) .
CD4* T cells against HCMV proteins have also been described ( 4 , 12 , 28 ) , and a significant response towards IE1 , the major immediate-early DNA-binding protein , has been reported ( 3 , 9 ) .
The precursor frequencies of IE1 -specific CD4 * T cells are high in latently infected individuals ( 9 ) , and cytokines such as gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- « ) found in the supernatant of CD4* T-cell clones specific for IE1 significantly reduce HCMV replication ( 10 ) .
The role of CD4~* T cells in HCMV infections was inferred from these in vitro studies and from in vivo studies showing that CD4 * T cells are required for the clearance of mouse cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ) in salivary glands of mice ( 22 ) .
Major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II expression is a key element in the control of the immune response .
It is required for the activation of T lymphocytes in the process of antigen ( Ag ) presentation by professional or nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) ( 13 ) .
Three essential transacti-vators of MHC class II genes have been identified : RFXS and RFX-AP are part of the RFX complex that binds to the X box * Corresponding author .

6582 of all MHC class II promoters , while the class II transactivator ( CHTA ) is itself tightly regulated , and this transactivator functions as the master controller of MHC class II expression , probably in all physiological conditions ( 30 , 42 ) .
Both constitutive and inducible expressions of MHC class II genes are indeed dependent on CIITA , and the CIITA gene is itself controlled by distinct alternative promoters ( 33 ) .
While CIITA promoters I and III are specific for constitutive expression in dendritic cells and B lymphocytes , respectively , induction of CIITA , and hence of MHC class II , by IFN-y is mediated by promoter IV .
Activation by IFN-y takes place via a cascade of events which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 by JAK1 and JAK2 kinases , followed by nuclear translocation and binding of STAT1 to a GAS sequence within the promoter of the target gene ( reviewed in reference 8 ) .
In the case of the activation of CIITA promoter IV by IFN-y , cooperation between three distinct and essential transacting factors , STAT1 and USF-1 ( binding cooperatively to a GAS-E box motif ) and IRF-1 , has recently been described in detail ( 34 ) .
This also explains why JAK1 and STAT1 mutants lack induc-ibility of MHC class II by IFN-y ( 31 ) .
The detailed dissection of these multiple steps of the cascade , from IFN-y activation to expression of MHC class II molecules ( 33 , 34 ) , now allows the assignment of various types of inhibition to specific steps within this cascade .
APC capacity is triggered by IFN-y treatment in many cell types , due to the induction of expression of HLA class II , the invariant chain , and HLA-DM which catalyzes the release of invariant chain-derived Clip peptide from HLA class II molecules and allows the binding of processed peptides ( 36 ) .
MHC class II molecules are known to present peptides derived from extracellular , exogenous Ag to CD4 * T cells ( 36 ) .
However , it appears that presentation of intracellular endogenous , especially viral , Ags is common ( 14 , 23 ) .
This suggests cognate interaction between CD4 * T cell and the infected MHC class II-positive APC .
Immunological controls of cytomegaloviruses are counter voL .
73 , 1999 balanced by escape mechanisms from class I-mediated recognition by CD8 * T cells , as recently described ( 46 ) .
Several genes localized in the unique short ( US ) region of the HCMV genome are responsible for down regulating HLA class I expression at multiple levels through retrotranslocation of HLA class I heavy chain to the cytosol ( US2 [ 19 , 47 ] and US11 [ 21 , 45 ] ) , retention in the endoplasmic reticulum ( US3 [ 1 , 20 ] ) and inhibition of TAP translocation of peptides ( USG [ 2 , 17 , 26 ] ) .
The CD4* compartment of cellular immunity has been suspected to be down regulated since the observation by Sedmak et al .
( 38 ) that HCMV inhibits HLA class II expression induced by IFN-y .
A recent report by Miller et al .
( 32 ) has described a mechanism of JAK1 proteolysis by HCMV to explain the inhibition of IFN-y-mediated induction of HLA class II .
In mice , Heise et al .
( 15 ) have reported that MCMV down regulates IFN-y-induced expression of MHC class I-related molecules through the inhibition of their transcription .
The mechanism , which occurs downstream of STAT1 activation , has yet to be determined .
In this paper , we made use of an astrocytoma cell line , U373 MG , which is fully permissive to HCMV .
This cell line can also be induced to express HLA-DR by treatment with IFN-y and to subsequently present Ag to HCMV IEl-specific CD4* T cells ( 11 ) .
We show here that HCMV infection prevents induction of HLA-DR expression by IFN-y in U373 MG cells .
This inhibition occurs downstream of the activation of STAT1 , whose phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are not inhibited by HCMV .
CIITA transcription is strongly repressed by cotreatment of cells with IFN-y plus HCMV .
Logically , this strong reduction of MHC class II expression by HCMV results in the absence of IE1 presentation and recognition by CD4 * T-cell clones .
Transfection of the U373 MG cells by CIITA , however , can restore both HLA-DR expression and the ability to present endogenously produced IE1 to CD4 * T cells , even following HCMV infection .
These results indicate that , in IFN-y-treated cells , down regulation of MHC class II expression by HCMV results from a repression of CIITA induction .
The modulation of MHC class II-dependent IE1 recognition by viral infection , via an effect on CIITA expression , can thus allow HCMV cells to escape from the CD4* T-cell response .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Virus , cell lines , and the IEl-specific CD4* T-cell clone .
HCMV ( Towne strain ) stocks were obtained by infection of foreskin fibroblasts at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0.01 in 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) culture medium ( RPMI-Glutamax I supplemented with sodium pyruvate and antibiotics from GIBCO-BRL ) .
U373 MG cells were cultured in 10 % FCS culture medium .
HCMV , fibroblasts , and U373 MG cells were kind gifts from S. Michelson ( Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) .
Transfection of U373 MG cells with the pSRa-neo/CIITA-Tag plasmid was performed by using the calcium phosphate method .
Transfected cells were then cloned by limiting dilution and HLA-DR expression was controlled by flow cytometry .
The previously described CD4* T-cell clone FzD3 specific for IE1 was obtained by limiting dilution from a healthy HCMV-seropositive donor ( 10 ) .
FzD3 clone was maintained by weekly restimulations with phytohemagglutinin and allogeneic irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) ( 20 U/m ! )
in culture medium supplemented with 10 % human serum .
HCMV inoculum was inactivated by using alternating UV and gamma irradi-ation .
Both were used to ensure that the results did not depend on the inacti-vation method .
MAb .
E13 , an immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) mouse monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) specific for immediate-early proteins UL122 to -123 , was a kind gift from M.-C. Mazeron ( Hopital Lariboisigre , Paris , France ) .
MAb CCH2 ( anti-ULA4 early protein ) was purchased from DAKO .
Control IgG1 myeloma protein was from Sigma .
W6/32 , OKT3 , and L243 MAbs were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection .

ESCAPE OF HCMV FROM CD4* T-CELL RESPONSE - 6583 RNase protection assays .
Quantitative analysis of CIITA and GBP mRNAs was performed by RNase protection assays as described in detail elsewhere ( 30 ) .
Immunoprecipitation .
U373 MG ( 10° cells ) was plated in culture medium in 25-cm* flasks and was either left untreated or was treated with IFN-y ( 300 U/ml ) , with IFN-y ( 300 U/ml ! )
plus HCMV ( MOLI = 5 ) , or incubated with HCMV alone ( MOI = 5 ) .
For MHC class I immunoprecipitation , cells were washed in phosphate-buff-ered saline ( PBS ) 24 h later , incubated in methionine-and-cysteine-free medium ( Gibco ) for 1 h , and labelled with [ *°SJmethionine plus ( 100 Ci/ ml ) ( ICN ) for 2 h. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 5 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl , , 0.05 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] , 50 mM Tris [ pH 7.6 ] ) for 45 min on ice .
Preclearing of the lysate was performed overnight by using protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads ( Pharma-cia ) .
W6/32 antibody was then added to the lysate for 1.5 h at 4°C .
Protein A-coupled Sepharose beads were then added , and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 4°C .
For MHC class II immunoprecipitation , cells were washed in PBS 18 h after treatment , incubated for 1 h in methionine-and-cysteine-free medium and labelled with [ *°S } methionine plus [ **SJeysteine for the last 6 h. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 5 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl , , 0.05 mM PMSF , 50 mM Tris [ pH 7.6 ] ) for 45 min on ice .
Preclearings were performed as follows : the cell lysates were incubated with normal mouse serum and protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads for 2 h. A second preclearing was performed by using 50 pil of zysorbin ( Zymed ) for 4 h. DA6-231 antibody was then added to the cell lysates , and incubation was performed overnight at 4°C .
Protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads were then added , and incubation was maintained for another 2 h. For both MHC class I and class II immunoprecipitations , the beads were then washed and boiled in 5 % B-mercaptocthanol reducing Laemmli buffer and run on 10 % polyacrylamide gels .
Gels were fixed , incubated in Amplify ( Amersham ) , vacuum dried , and exposed to hyperfilm-MP ( Amersham } .
Flow cytometry .
U373 MG cells were infected by using supernatant from infected fibroblasts .
U373 MG cells were treated with IFN-y ( 300 U/ml ) or with IFN-y plus HCMV or IFN-y plus gamma-irradiated HCMV .
The contents of wells were aspirated and replaced with fresh medium and fresh IFN-y on day 3 .
The culture was allowed to proceed for an additional 3 days .
U373 MG cells were then double stained for cell surface HLA-DR and intracellular immediate-early ( UL122 to -123 ) or early ( ULA44 ) proteins and analyzed by flow cytometry .
Cell viability was assessed by using Trypan Blue exclusion and was found to be greater than 80 % .
For double staining , U373 MG cells were incubated for 20 min at 4°C with saturating amounts of OKT3 ( used as a control ) or L243 MAb in Ca**/Mg**-free PBS-3 % FCS plus 0.1 % NaN , ( staining buffer ) , washed twice in staining buffer , then incubated with goat F ( ab ' ) , fragment anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( Sigma ) .
Cells were washed twice in staining buffer , then incubated for 90 min at 4°C with OKT3 to saturate unbound anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate Fab sites , then fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4°C and washed with PSN buffer ( PBS + 1 % normal goat serum + 1 mM EDTA + 0.05 % saponin ) .
MAbs ( IgG1 ) specific for HCMV immediate-early ( E13 ) and early ( CCH2 ) proteins , or IgG1 myeloma protein ( Sigma ) used as a control , were diluted in PSN , and added to cell samples for a 90-min incubation at 37°C .
Cells were washed twice in PSN buffer and incubated for 20 min at 4°C with isotype-specific phycoerythrin-coupled anti-IgG1 goat anti-mouse F ( ab ' ) , antiserum ( Southern Biotechnology ) .
Samples were then analyzed by using an EPICS Elite cell sorter .
Immunocytochemistry .
U373 MG cells were seeded at 30,000 cells per well ( 24-well plate ; FALCON ) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with heat-inactivated 10 % FCS and were cultured for 24 h. They were then cultured in serum-free medium for another 24 h. Then they were treated with IFN-y ( 300 U/m ! )
and , except for controls , were infected with HCMV for 15 or 30 min or 1 , 6 , or 24 h. Cells were washed once with 1 % PBS and were fixed with 1 ml of 1 % PBS containing 3 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4°C .
Immunochemistry was then performed by using a rabbit PhosphoPlus STAT1 ( Tyr 701 ) antiserum ( Biolabs ) .
The biotinylated secondary antibody was a peroxidase-coupled horse anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG ( Vectastain ABC kit ; Vector Laboratories ) .
Staining was revealed by using diaminobenzidine ( Sigma ) and H ; O , .
IE1-specific CD4* T-cell clone response .
U373 MG cells were seeded at 1.5 X 10° cells/well in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FCS in a 6-well plate ( FALCON ) .
Cells were mock infected or treated with HCMV or UV-irradiated HCMV ( MOI = 5 ) and treated simultaneously with IFN-y ( 300 U/ml ! ) .
Cells were fed on day 3 with fresh medium supplemented with IFN-y ( 300 U/ml ! )
and were left in culture for an additional 2 days .
U373 MG-CIITA cells were mock infected or infected with either HCMV or UV-irradiated HCMV at an MOI of 5 for 5 days .
U373 MG and U373 MG-CIITA cells were incubated with specific IE1 peptide ( amino acids 91 to 110 ) ( Neosystem , Strasbourg , France ) at a concentration of 10 M overnight .
U373 MG and U373 MG-CIITA cells were then harvested , washed , and plated in triplicate ( 3 X 10° cells per well ) in a 96-well plate in the presence of 3 x 10+ FzD3 IE1-specific CD4* T-cell clones in a final volume of 200 ul for 24 h. Then supernatants were collected , triplicates were pooled , and IFN-y was measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( Medgenix Screening Line ) .

In another protocol derived from reference 32 , cells were left untreated , treated with IFN-y alone , or treated with IFN-y after 72 h of infection by HCMV .
The incubation was stopped by using ice-cold PBS .
Cells were washed , detached with a cell scraper in PBS , and pelleted at 300 x g for 10 min .
Cells were lysed in reducing Laemmli buffer .
Samples equivalent to 3 X 10° cells each were run on a 7.5 % acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Amersham ) .
Membranes were incubated with a rabbit PhosphoPlus STAT1 ( Tyr 701 ) -specific antiserum ( Biolabs ) , followed by incubation with a secondary peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antiserum ( Biolabs ) .
Bands were revealed by using an ECL detection kit ( Amersham ) .
RESULTS Inhibition of IFN-y-induced HLA-DR expression by HCMV infection .
We tested the induction of HLA-DR by IFN-y in infected U373 MG cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
As expected and as previously shown ( 11 ) , IFN-y in the absence of HCMV induced high levels of HLA-DR expression in U373 MG cells .
Simultaneous coincubation of HCMV with IFN-y almost totally prevented HLA-DR expression .
A small proportion ( 12 % ) of cells expressed low levels of HLA-DR molecules in spite of HCMV infection .
This incomplete down regulation of HLA-DR by HCMV was observed in all the experiments performed .
In these samples , immediate-early ( UL122 and UL123 ) and early ( ULA4 ) proteins were detectable by using E13 and CCH2 MAbs , respectively .
This indicated that , when U373 MG cells are incubated with IFN-y and HCMV simultaneously , IFN-y does not prevent HCMV infection , but HCMV inhibits IFN y-induced HLA-DR expression .
To test whether active infection accounted for the inhibition of HLA-DR , HCMV was gamma irradiated ( 800 Gy ) and tested in the same experiment .
Twenty percent of the cells expressed residual immediate-early proteins , and only 8 % expressed the protein encoded by ULA4 , recognized by CCH2 antibody .
This clearly showed that the virus was inactivated .
Irradiated HCMV inoculum did not prevent IFN-y-induced HLA-DR expression .
In addition , pelleted HCMV , but neither supernatant nor UV-irradiated HCMV , repressed HLA-DR induction ( results not shown ) .
This suggested that neither virion-associated proteins nor cytokines included in the inoculum were responsible for repression of HLA-DR induction .
Inhibition of IFN-y-induced HLA-DR synthesis by HCMV infection .
To test whether the inhibition of HLA-DR expression was observed at an earlier step than cell surface expression , we immunoprecipitated nascent HLA-DR molecules from [ °°S ] Met- [ ~°S ] Cys-labelled U373 MG cells by using the B-chain-specific MAb DA6-231 .
As shown in Fig .
2 , a 24-h treatment with IFN-y induced the appearance of bands which correspond to the HLA-DR « , the invariant , and the HLA-DR B chains , respectively .
The B chain , which contains fewer Met and Cys residues than the « and invariant chains , was less labelled , and the corresponding band was fainter .
In IFN-y plus HCMV-infected cells , these bands were no longer de-tected .
This result confirms HCMV inhibition of HLA-DR expression in U373 MG cells and shows that this inhibition is Vou .

Inhibition of IFN-y-induced HLA-DR B chain synthesis by HCMV .
U373 MG cells were treated with IFN-y and/or HCMV or left untreated for 18 h and were pulsed with *°S for 6 h. Cells were lysed , and HLA-DR B chain synthesis was analyzed by immunoprecipitation by using DAG-231 antibody coupled to Sepharose-protein G. Three experiments , which gave similar results , were performed .
detectable at the level of protein synthesis after a 24-h cotreatment with IFN-y plus HCMV .
MHC class I up regulation by IFN-y is not repressed by HCMV .
To test whether HCMV also inhibited IFN-y-induced MHC class I upregulation , we performed immunoprecipita-tions of HLA-A , -B , and -C molecules by using W6/32 MAb .
As shown in Fig .
3 , and as expected , MHC class I protein expression was upregulated by IFN-y .
This up regulation was not inhibited by HCMV concomitant infection .
As previously described ( 19 ) , HLA class I expression was decreased in U373 MG cells infected with HCMV .
The lack of effect of HCMV infection on the increase of MHC class I expression induced by IFN-y indicates a clear dissociation between the effects of HLA class I Heavy Chain HCMV on the MHC class II and MHC class I pathways of activation by IFN-y .
Inhibition of HLA-DR synthesis is not due to a defect in IFN-y-induced STAT activation .
Since IFN-y-induced HLA-DR expression is dependent upon STAT1 activation ( 24 ) , we tested whether STAT1 phosphorylation , which occurs rapidly in response to IFN-y , was inhibited by HCMV .
As shown in Fig .
4A , and in accordance with previous reports ( 39 , 41 ) , STAT1 was phosphorylated after as little as 15 min of IFN-y treatment .
Both p91 and splice variant p84 were de-tected .
This phosphorylation was present at late time points ( 24 and 72 h ) and was not inhibited by HCMV infection at a time point ( 24 h ) when HLA-DR proteins were not detectable FIG .

STAT1 activation in the presence of IFN-y and HCMV .
( A ) U373 MG cells were either untreated or incubated in the presence of IFN-y or IFN-y plus HCMV for 15 min and 6 , 24 , and 72 h. STAT1 phosphorylation was evaluated in a Western blot by using an anti-P-Tyr-STAT1 specific antiserum .
Levels of STAT1 protein were evaluated in the same samples by using an anti-STAT1 antiserum .
( B ) U373 MG cells were either incubated with IFN-y for 15 min or 6 h in the absence of HCMV or incubated with IFN-y after 72 h of infection with HCMV .
STAT1 phosphorylation was then evaluated in a Western blot by using an anti-P-Tyr-STAT1 specific antiserum .
Levels of STAT1 protein were evaluated in the same samples by using an anti-STAT1 antiserum .
Three experiments , which gave similar results , were performed .
J. Virou .
( see Fig .
2 ) .
These results suggested that inhibition of HLA-DR expression was not related to defects in STAT1 phosphorylation in our experimental conditions .
However , STAT1 phosphorylation was inhibited after a 72-h coincubation with IFN-y plus HCMV .
Similar results were observed when we used foreskin fibroblasts ( data not shown ) .
Recently , Miller et al .
( 32 ) have described an inhibition of IFN-y-induced HLA-DR expression by HCMV in endothelial cells and fibroblasts through JAK1 proteolysis , which logically leads to reduced STAT1 phosphorylation .
These observations were made by using a different protocol , consisting of a 72-h prein-cubation with HCMV before IFN-y treatment .
Using their protocol , we also observed that STAT1 phosphorylation was inhibited after 15 min and 6 h of IFN-y treatment in U373 MG-infected cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
This shows that U373 MG cells were not refractory to the mechanism described by Miller et al. , and our data suggest the existence of another mechanism , perhaps earlier in the infection , which does not involve the inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation .
STAT1 is quickly translocated to the nucleus after phosphorylation ( 8 ) .
In U373 MG cells , nuclear translocation of STAT1 occurred after 15 min of incubation with IFN-y ( not shown ) .
Figure 5 shows that IFN-y-induced P-STAT1 translocation to the nucleus was not inhibited by HCMV infection even after a 24-h coincubation .
Therefore , STAT1 activation and nuclear translocation occur with the same intensity and same kinetics in IFN-y- and IFN-y plus HCMV-treated U373 MG cells at experimental time points when HCMV inhibits IFN-y-induced HLA-DR expression .
Repression of CIITA mRNA expression by HCMV infection .
Since HLA-DR repression was not mediated by a defect in STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation , we looked for an inhibition further down the pathway of IFN-y signalling .
We therefore looked at CIITA transcription in IFN-y- and IFN-y plus HCMV-treated U373 MG cells .
RNase protection assays ( Fig .
6 ) showed that CIITA mRNA expression was induced after 6 h of treatment with IFN-y , as previously described ( 7 , 41 ) .
The levels of CIITA mRNA were 13.5 times lower in cells treated with IFN-y plus HCMV than in cells treated with IFN-y alone .
Interestingly , expression of the GBP gene , which is also up-regulated by IFN-y , was also inhibited by HCMV ( ninefold decrease ) , implying a mechanism common to the regulation of these two genes .
The kinetics of induction of CIITA by IFN-y and its inhibition in HCMV-infected cells suggest that the quick repression of CIHITA after infection accounts for the observed reduction in HLA-DR expression by HCMV .
In an additional experiment , CIITA transcription was found to be still repressed after 24 h of treatment with IFN-y plus HCMV ( data not shown ) .
Restoration of CD4* T-cell clone recognition of HCMV IE1 by constitutive CIITA expression in infected U373 MG cells .
We next tested the consequences of HLA-DR repression on the activation of a specific anti-IE1 T-cell clone which recognizes the HCMV IE1 peptide ( amino acids 91 to 110 ) presented by HLA-DR3-typed U373 MG ( 11 ) .
Figure 7 shows IFN-y production as an assay for activation of T-cell clone FzD11 .
This clone produced high amounts of IFN-y when incubated with IFN-y-treated U373 MG cells pulsed with the IE1 peptide ( amino acids 91 to 110 ) ( Fig .
7A ) .
However , the FzD11 CD4 * T-cell clone was not activated by U373 MG cells infected by HCMV and treated with IFN-y for 5 days .
This was not due to the inhibition of IE1 production since high levels of immediate-early proteins were detectable in this protocol ( Fig .
1 ) .
Figure 7B shows that the FzD11 clone was activated in the presence of CIHITA-transfected U373 MG cells ( U373 MG voL .

This clone was not activated when U373 MG-CIITA cells were treated with UV-irradiated virus ( Fig .
7B ) .
This suggested that endogenously produced IE1 was presented during HCMV infection .
Difference of IFN-y production by the clone when incubated with U373 MG-CIITA cells infected by HCMV or presenting IE1 peptide can be explained by the high concentration of peptide used ( 10 LM ) which could not be reached during infection .
Similar results were obtained with other anti-IE1 CD4 * T-cell clones ( results not shown ) .
Therefore , our results show the following : ( i ) the repression of HLA-DR expression in IFN-y-treated U373 MG cells affects the anti-IE1 CD4+* T-cell response by preventing the presentation of endogenous IE1 peptide ; and ( ii ) constitutive expression of CIITA restores IE1 presentation by infected U373 MG cells , indicating that the defect of HLA-DR expres- IFN-y + + = a HCMV _ + e + a CHTA = TBP =~ GBP =~ FIG .

sion due to HCMV occurs upstream of the expression of CHITA .
DISCUSSION We have shown in this paper that HCMV escapes from CD4 * T-lymphocyte recognition through inhibition of IFN-y-induced HLA-DR expression .
The inhibition is mediated by negative regulation of CIHITA transcription .
This is the first report of virus-mediated inhibition of CIITA transcription .
A defect linked with viral infection is clearly involved in the repression of HLA-DR expression .
This was concluded from A : 100000 10000 1000 100 10 IFN- y -treated U373 MG 100000 10000 1000 100 10 IFN-y ( pg/m1 ) FIG .

Restoration of recognition of endogenous IE1 by specific CD4* T-cell clone through constitutive expression of CIITA .
Untransfected U373 MG cells were treated with IFN-y and UV-inactivated or unmanipulated HCMV and were used as APC in T-cell specificity assays of IE1-specific CD4* T-cell clones .
Production of IFN-y was measured ( A ) .
CIITA-transfected U373 MG cells were treated either with UV-irradiated or unmanipulated HCMV and used as APC in T-cell specificity assays of IEl-specific CD4* T-cell clones ( B ) .

the need for infectious virus to inhibit HLA-DR induction and from the observation of viral protein expression in cells with repressed HLA-DR .
The inhibition of HLA-DR is not due to cytokines contained in the viral inoculum for the following reasons : first , irradiated virus had no negative effect on IFN-y-induced HLA-DR expression ; second , pelleted infectious virus prevented HLA-DR induction effectively ( data not shown ) ; third , the amounts of transforming growth factor B1 , which is known to be involved in HLA-DR down regulation through inhibition of CIITA transcription ( 25 , 35 ) , were found to be similar in the inoculum to that of regular 10 % FCS culture medium ( 300 pg/ml ) ( data not shown ) , and IFN-B has been reported to act downstream of CIITA ( 29 ) .
Treatment of cells with phosphonacetic acid did not prevent HLA-DR inhibition ( data not shown ) , which suggests that the viral protein involved is encoded in the immediate-early and early phases of infection .
Besides , the kinetics of CIITA inhibition ( 6 h postinfec-tion ) suggest that the repression occurs in the immediate-early phase of infection .
However , this point needs further investigation to help identify the viral protein ( s ) involved .
Our present data point to a transcriptional modulation of CIITA expression due to viral infection .
Therefore , inhibition of the IFN-y-inducible promoter IV is expected to account for the down regulation of CIITA .
This inhibition is not unique to CIITA , since repression of both CIITA and GBP was ob-served .
As both are under the control of IRF-1 ( 5 , 34 ) , which is itself activated by STAT1 ( 27 ) , a defect in IRF-1 transcription or in its binding to the IRF-1 box of promoter IV may be suspected .
However , the increase of HLA class I synthesis induced by IFN-y , also under the control of IRF-1 ( 18 ) , was not inhibited by HCMV , in accordance with a previous report ( 16 ) .
This indicates uncoupling of HLA class I and class II regulation in response to IFN-y and HCMV and argues against a major role of IRF-1 in the inhibition of HLA-DR induction .
Alternatively , functional activity of STAT1 through interaction with other transcriptional factors such as USFI1 ( 34 ) may be impaired and result in down regulation of CHITA transcription .
Multistep inhibitions of IFN-y-induced HLA class II expression and escape from CD4 * T-cell response in HCMV infection are likely to represent the counterpart of HLA class I inhibition of expression ( 46 ) .
A recent paper by Miller et al .
( 32 ) showed that degradation of the JAK1 protein was responsible for down regulation of HLA-DR in endothelial cells .
Although this process was found to occur in the immediate-early or early phase of infection , it required infection of the cells prior to IFN-y treatment to effectively inhibit HLA-DR induction .
In the present paper , it is clear that the impaired HLA-DR production was not due to a defect in STAT1 activation .
Therefore , our protocol of simultaneous coincubation of IFN-y and HCMV unravels a new mechanism of HLA-DR inhibition which is not related to STAT1 activation , since STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were present at a time point ( 24 h ) when HLA-DR protein synthesis was repressed .
Rather , this mechanism involves the inhibition of CIITA RNA expression .
However , U373 MG was not refractory to the mechanism described by Miller et al. , since we observed an inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation when their protocol was applied ( Fig .
4B ) , and when we used our protocol , STAT1 phosphorylation was strongly diminished after 72 h of cotreatment with IFN-y plus HCMV .
We conclude that several mechanisms can account for the diminished HLA-DR expression in response to IFN-y .
We suggest that CIITA repression occurs prior to inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation .
Another recent report showed inhibition of transcription of MHC class II by MCMV with normal STAT1 activation ( 15 ) J. Virou .
similar to what we observed in HCMV .
Whether the mechanism used by MCMV is similar to the one we describe in the present report remains to be investigated .
Our present data , which identify the defect in CIITA gene activation , also suggest that transcription of other genes which follow similar regulation , as shown for GBP , may be altered by HCMV infection .
However , not all IFN-y-inducible genes are expected to be the target of HCMV in view of normal up regulation of HLA class I synthesis in the presence of IFN-y and HCMV .
The mechanism involved in HLA-DR down regulation , which occurs upstream of CIITA and downstream of STAT1 activation , suggests transcription regulation by an immediate-early protein .
Current studies in our laboratory are aimed at identifying this viral protein ( s ) .
In addition to helping to understand HLA class II transcription and HCMV regulation of transcription , the identification of such a protein would be useful in situations where targeted immunosuppression is required to down modulate exacerbated ( autoimmunity ) or nonappropriate ( transplantation ) MHC class II expression .
Although U373 MG cells are not bona fide APC , they are capable of processing and presenting endogenous Ag produced by infected cells when transfected with CIITA in the absence of IFN-y treatment .
Infection of cells by UV-irradiated HCMV did not activate CD4 * T-cell clones , showing that IE1 peptide was processed from neosynthesized protein in infected U373 MG-CIITA cells .
Presentation of neosynthesized IE1 and cognate activation of infected cells by CD4* anti-IE1 T lymphocytes has not been documented before .
The role of IEl-specific CD4* T cells could be the control of cognate , infected APC through release of anti-viral cytokines such as IFN-y and TNF- « .
This effect may depend on the cell type and on the state of differentiation of cells , since IFN-y and TNF-a have been shown to favor the differentiation and infection of macrophages ( 40 ) .
However , CD4 * T-cell clones produce cytokines other than IFN-y and TNF-a which possess anti-HCMV activity and may reduce infection ( 10 ) .
Our data suggest that HCMV allows infected cells to escape from CD4 * recognition by blocking the required induction of HLA-DR .
In conclusion , we have shown , using U373 MG cells as a model , that HCMV escapes from anti-IE1 CD4* T-lymphocyte response in vitro by interfering with the IFN-y-mediated induction of HLA-DR at the level of CIITA induction .
HCMV has evolved a number of stealth mechanisms which may account for a very high prevalence of HCMV infection in the population and latency in immunocompetent hosts .
The modulation of the anti-IE1 CD4 * T-cell response is likely to play an important role in the host-HCMV balance .
Further experiments are needed to demonstrate that the defect we describe here alters the functional CD4* T-cell response in acute infections in vivo .
