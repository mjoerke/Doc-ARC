Here we report that Cot kinase , a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase involved in T cell activation , up-regulates COX-2 gene expression in Jurkat T cells .
Induction of COX-2 promoter activity by Cot kinase occurred mainly through activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .
Mutation of the distal ( -105/-97 ) and proximal ( -76/-61 ) NFAT response elements in the COX-2 promoter abolished the activation induced by Cot kinase .
Even more , coexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT inhibited Cot kinase-mediated COX-2 promoter activation , whereas cotransfection of a constitutively active version of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin synergizes with Cot kinase in the up-regulation of COX-2 promoter-driven transcription .
Strikingly , Cot kinase increased transactivation mediated by a GAL4-NFAT fusion protein containing the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFAT p. In contrast to phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore A23187 , Cot kinase increases both COX-2 promoter activity and NFAT-mediated transactivation in a cyclosporin A-inde-pendent manner .
These data indicate that Cot kinase up-regulates COX-2 promoter-driven - transcription through the NFAT response elements , being the Cot kinase-induced NFAT-dependent transactivation presumably implicated in this up-regulation .
Cot/Tpl-2 kinase has been implicated in cellular activation and transformation ( 1-6 ) .
This kinase was initially discovered in a truncated form ( 6 , 7 ) that provides higher oncogenic ca-pacity , although overexpression of the normal gene is also capable of conferring a transformed phenotype in established cell lines ( 7-10 ) .
The Cot/Tpl-2 protein , which is homologous to members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family ( 1-5 ) , regulates the activity of different transduction pathways that converge into the activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinases : c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extra-cellular signal-regulated kinases 1 ( p42/44 ) , 6 ( p387 ) , and 5 ( 1 , 10-12 ) .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org activation , promoting tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-2 production by activating the transcription of these genes ( 13-15 ) .
Cot/Tpl-2 regulation of gene transcription occurs mainly through activation of several transcription factors such as AP-1 ' ( 10 , 12 , 14 ) , NFAT ( 14-16 ) , and NF- « B ( 16-18 ) .
Two enzymes , cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , catalyze the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of prostaglandins ( for review , see Ref .
19 ) .
COX-1 is a consti-tutive enzyme thought to be involved in `` housekeeping '' func-tions .
In contrast , COX-2 is induced in a variety of cell types by diverse stimuli including growth factors , mitogens , cytokines , and tumor promoters ( 19 ) .
COX-2 is induced in T lymphocytes upon T cell receptor activation , suggesting functional implications of this enzyme in this process ( 20 , 21 ) .
This induction takes place at the transcriptional level and is mediated by two NFAT sites in the COX-2 promoter ( 21 ) .
Previous studies in different cells types ( including vascular endothelial cells , lung epithelial cells , synoviocytes , pancreatic cells , gingival fibro-blasts , and monocytes ) have shown the importance of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors in other cell types ( 22-34 ) .
In unstimulated T cells NFAT transcription factor is heavily phosphorylated and localized in the cytosol .
Upon T cell activation , it becomes dephosphorylated by calcium/calcineurin phosphatase and translocates into the nucleus ( for review , see Ref .
35 ) .
Stimulation of T cells by phorbol esters and calcium ionophore A23187 regulates not only the nuclear localization of NFAT , but also its transactivation activity ( 35 , 36 ) .
In the present study , we have analyzed the regulation of COX-2 by Cot kinase in human T cells , showing that Cot induces transcription of COX-2 in these cells .
Regulation of COX-2 expression by Cot kinase occurs mainly through activation of NFAT .
Both distal and proximal NFAT response elements in the COX-2 promoter are essential for Cot kinase-mediated induction .
We also provide evidence that neither NF- « B nor c-Jun is involved in this activation .
Finally , we have determined that Cot kinase increases transactivation mediated by the N-terminal domain of NFAT .
Involvement of Cot kinase-induced NFAT transactivation in the COX-2 promoter activation is discussed further .

Cot kinase activity induces COX-2 mRNA levels in Jurkat cells .
Total RNA from Jurkat cells electroporated with 10 ug/ml pEF-BOS trunc-Cot or 10 ug/ml pEF-BOS stimulated or not with 1 uM calcium ionophore ( Zon ) and 15 ng/ml TPA , was used for reverse transcription-PCR analysis to measure COX-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) mRNA levels .
Amplified cDNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis , and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
Data shown correspond to a number of cycles in which the amount of amplified product is proportional to the abundance of starting material .
The figure shows one of the three experiments performed .
Transcriptional Activation of Cyclooxygenase-2 by Cot Kinase GAL4-hNFAT1 ( 1-415 ) contains the first 415 amino acids of the human NFAT1l/p fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast GALA transcription factor ( amino acids 1-147 ) .
This plasmid was constructed by subcloning a PCR fragment of the hNFAT1 ( 40 ) into the pABGAL-linker plasmid ( 41 ) digested with Xhol .
The 5'-primer used was GGetc-gagATGAACGCCCCCGAGCGGCAGC ; the 3'-primer , CCCgtcegacT-TACTGCACCTCGATCCGCAGCTCG , contains a Sa/l site ( lowercase letters ) .
The sequence was confirmed by automatic sequencing .
The GAL4-DBD is the parental vector pABGAL-linker plasmid .
The GAL4-luciferase reporter plasmid includes five copies of GAL4 DNA binding sites fused to the luciferase gene ( 42 ) .
Reverse Transcription-PCR Assay-The human leukemia T cell line Jurkat was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , 50 ug/ml gentamycin , and 2 mM L-glutamine ( complete medium ) .
Jurkat cells were electroporated with 10 ug/ml pEF-BOS or pEF-BOS trunc-Cot as described by Ballester ef al .
( 14 ) .
In these conditions the electroporation efficiency , as tested by green fluorescence protein expression , was about 30-40 % .
80 min after electroporation , transfected cells were stimulated overnight with 1 pM calcium ionophore and 15 ng/ml TPA , and total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol protocol ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
1 ug of total RNA from control or stimulated cells was used to perform the reverse transcription reaction .
The specific primers for either human COX-2 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for PCR amplification has been described previously ( 20 ) .
The PCR was amplified 20-35 denaturation cycles at 94 °C for 1 min , annealing at 60 °C for 1 min , and extension at 72 °C for 1 min .
Amplified cDNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis , and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
Promoter-driven Transcription and Transactivation Assays-Jurkat cells were cotransfected unless otherwise indicated , with 0.75 ug/ml of different COX-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs together with 0.35 ug/ml pEF-BOS , pEF-BOS Cot , pEF-BOS trunc-Cot , or pEF-BOS inac-Cot constructs utilizing Lipofectin reagent ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
All transfections were normalized to the same amount of DNA .
20 h after transfection , cells were stimulated with 10 pg/ml soluble a-CD3 , isolated as described by Ballester et al .

Cyclosporin A ( CsA , 100 ng/ml , Sandoz ) was added to the cells 1 h before stimulation .
Cells were collected by centrifugation , and luciferase activity was determined by the luciferase assay kit ( Promega ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
For transactivation assays , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with 0.3 ug/ml GAL4-DBD or GAL4-hNFAT1 ( 1-415 ) expression vector and 0.5 ug/ml GALA luciferase reporter plasmid together with 0.35 ug/ml of the different pEF-BOS constructs .

In agreement with these data , COX-2 mRNA was increased in Jurkat cells transfected with the empty pEF-BOS vector upon treatment with calcium ionophore plus TPA ( Fig .

Interestingly , cotransfection of Jurkat cells with an active form of Cot kinase ( pEF-BOS trunc-Cot ) increased the levels of COX-2 transcript .
Thus , overexpression of truncated Cot kinase was sufficient to detect increased levels of COX-2 tran-scripts , although maximal induction was observed in cells over-expressing Cot kinase upon calcium ionophore plus TPA stimulation ( Fig .

The graph shows the mean of RLU values of two different experiments performed in duplicate + S.D .
To analyze if Cox-2 mRNA induction by Cot kinase correlated with an increase in the transcriptional activity mediated by the COX-2 promoter , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with different COX-2 promoter luciferase constructs and expression vectors for wild type or truncated Cot kinase .
In agreement with the regulation of COX-2 mRNA levels by Cot kinase activity , expression of truncated Cot kinase strongly increased transcription driven by a construct spanning from -998 to + 104 base pairs of the COX-2 promoter ( P2-1102 ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
Overexpression of wild type Cot kinase also up-regulated COX-2 promoter activity although to a slightly lower extent than constitutively active truncated Cot kinase ( Fig .
24 ) .
We next decided to investigate whether COX-2 promoter activation after T cell stimulation requires endogenous Cot kinase .
For this , Jurkat cells were transfected with the P2-1102 construct together with an inactive form of Cot kinase ( pEF-BOS inac- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 27006 A Transcriptional Activation of Cyclooxygenase-2 by Cot Kinase dNFat CRE EUC ] NFA4L6 _ pNFAT TATA P2- 274 Fic .

The NFAT sites of COX-2 promoter are essential for Cot kinase-mediated induction .

Cotransfection of 0.35 ug/ml or 0.11 ug/ml of the pEF-BOS inac-Cot construct blocked activation of the COX-2 promoter-driven transcription triggered by « -CD3 plus « -CD28 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Treatment with PDBu plus calcium ionophore induced a higher stimulation of the COX-2 promoter-driven transcription , and consequently a higher concentration ( 0.35 ug/ml ) of pEF-BOS inac-Cot was required to abolish this induction ( Fig .
2B ) .
To identify the minimal region in the COX-2 promoter responsible for Cot kinase-mediated activation , Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with different deletions of the COX-2 promoter ( P2-1102 , P2-626 , P2-431 , P2-274 , P2-192 , and P2-150 ) together with pEF-BOS trunc-Cot .
Deletion up to -170 in the P2-274 construct did not significantly affect activation of COX-2 promoter activity by Cot .
Thus , Cot kinase increased about 6-10-fold the transcription driven by P2-1103 , P2-626 , P2-431 , and P2-274 COX-2 promoter constructs ( Fig .
3 ) .
However , deletion of the -170 to -88 region of the COX-2 promoter ( P2-192 ) decreased the capacity of truncated Cot kinase to induce COX-2 transcription , and only a 3-fold activation was observed .
Further deletion up to -46 ( P2-150 ) abrogated COX-2 inducibility by Cot kinase .
The pXP2 vector showed no activation when cotransfected with truncated Cot kinase ( data not shown ) .
In agreement with the up-regulation of COX-2 transcript levels ( Fig .
1 ) , calcium ionophore and PDBu cooperated with truncated Cot kinase in the activation of COX-2 promoter ( Fig .
3 ) .
Cot kinase also cooperated with « -CD3 , « -CD28 , or calcium ionophore but not with PDBu in the induction of COX-2 promoter transcription ( data not shown ) .
Identification of the Cis-acting Elements Involved in COX-2 Promoter Up-regulation by Cot Kinase-It is known that Cot kinase up-regulates gene transcription through activation of NF-kB ( 16-18 ) .
On the other hand , the presence of a functional NF-KB site in the COX-2 promoter located at -223/-214 has been reported .
Therefore , we next decided to analyze the role of this site in the activation of COX-2 promoter by Cot kinase in T cells .
For this , we compared the behavior of constructs P2-431 ( containing this NF-KB site ) , P2-274 ( a deletion lacking this site ) , and a construct in which the NF- « B site was mutated ( P2-431 « kB-mut ) in response to Cot kinase overexpression .
The results shown in Fig .
44 indicated that these constructs were equally stimulated in response to Cot kinase or PDBu plus calcium ionophore treatment , discarding a role of this NF- « B site in the activation of COX-2 promoter by Cot kinase in T cells ( Fig .
4A ) .
As a control , Cot kinase effectively induced transcription of luciferase reporter gene p3x- « B , containing a trimer of a NF-kB response element ( not shown ) .
The role of NF-kB in COX-2 promoter activation was investigated further by co-transfecting p65 NF-kB together with P2-481 or P2-274 .
As a control of NF- « B-driven transcription stimulation , p65 NF- « B was cotransfected with the reporter p3x- « B luciferase .
Transfection of p65 did not increase the transcriptional activity of P2-431 COX-2 but increased by about 4.5-fold the driven transcription activity of p3x- « B ( Fig .
4B ) .
Taken together the above results discard a role of NF- « B in the activation of COX-2 promoter by Cot kinase in T cells .
The role of the distal ( dNFAT ) and proximal ( pNFAT ) NFAT sites of the COX-2 promoter in the activation by Cot kinase was investigated by performing cotransfection experiments with P2-274 COX-2 promoter mutated in any of these sites or in both , together with pEF-BOS trunc-Cot .
Mutation of either pNFAT or dNFAT sites in the P2-274 COX-2 promoter partially decreased the activation by Cot kinase .
Interestingly , mutation of both NFAT sites abolished the induction of P2-274 COX-2 promoter transcription triggered by Cot kinase ( Fig .
5A ) .
These data suggest that induction of COX-2 promoter occurs through activation of NFAT transcription fac-tor .
Moreover , overexpression of NFAT wt synergized with 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Transcriptional Activation of Cyclooxygenase-2 by Cot Kinase truncated Cot kinase in the induction of COX-2 promoter ( around 40-fold ) .
Stimulation by calcium ionophore plus PDBu of these transfected cells increased COX-2 promoter activity further ( 120-fold ) ( Fig .
5B ) .
Conversely , overexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT ( dnNFAT ) blocked the P2-274 COX-2 promoter-driven transcription induced by truncated Cot kinase as well as that triggered by calcium ionophore plus PDBu stimulation ( Fig .

B The graph shows the RLU values of two 27007 ( 10 , 12 , 14 ) so we next decided to study the role of this transcription factor in the up-regulation of the COX-2 promoter by Cot kinase .
For this , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with P2-274 and pEF-BOS trunc-Cot in the presence of a dominant negative version of c-Jun , named TAM67 .
Overexpression of TAM67 did not modify the induction of COX-2 promoter by Cot kinase ( Fig .
6 ) .
On the contrary , it decreased COX-2 promoter-driven transcription induced by PDBu plus calcium ionophore ( Ref .
21 and Fig .
6 ) as well as the activation triggered by truncated Cot kinase together with PDBu plus calcium ionophore stimulation ( Fig .
6 ) .
Involvement of the Calcineurin/ NFAT Pathway in the Activation of COX-2 Promoter by Cot Kinase-The immunosuppres-sive drug CsA inhibits calcineurin activity and consequently blocks the nuclear translocation of NFAT ( 43 ) .
Addition of CsA inhibited the stimulation of the COX-2 promoter induced by PDBu plus calcium ionophore as expected .
In contrast , the up-regulation of COX-2 promoter induced by Cot kinase was CsA-independent ( Fig .
7A ) .
Cotransfection of ACAM-AI ( an activated form of calcineurin ) increased COX-2 promoter activity about 3-fold ( Fig .
7B ) .
Mutation of any of the proximal or distal NFAT sites in P2-274 COX-2 promoter abolished this up-regulation .
Strikingly , ACAM-AI synergized with Cot kinase in COX-2 promoter activation ( 270-fold ) ( Fig .
7B ) .
Mutation of any of the proximal or distal NFAT sites in P2-274 COX-2 promoter significantly decreased ( by 60-80 % ) up-regulation of COX-2 transcription triggered by overexpression of ACAM-AI together with truncated Cot kinase .
Full abrogation occurs when both sites were mutated .

NFAT-The above results suggest that Cot kinase was acting on the NFAT pathway in parallel to calcineurin .
It has been described that phorbol ester and calcium ionophore stimulation of NFAT does not only involve its nuclear translocation , but also the optimal function of the transactivation domain located at the N terminus domain of NFAT ( 85 , 36 , 44 ) .
To study the implication of Cot kinase in the transactivation of NFAT , cotransfection experiments of Cot kinase together with GAL4-NFATp were performed .
The GAL4-NFATp fusion protein is constitutively expressed in the nucleus because of the strong nuclear localization signal at the N terminus of GAL4 ( 45 ) and contains the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFATp .
Overexpression of both truncated or wild type Cot strongly potentiated the function of the NFAT transactivation domain ( Fig .
8A ) .
As a control , Cot kinase did not induce activity when cotransfected with GAL4-DBD .
Similar to what we observed with the inducibility of the COX-2 promoter , truncated Cot kinase activated more effectively than wild type Cot kinase transactivation mediated by NFAT .
Even more , CsA inhibited NFAT transactivation induced by phorbol esters plus calcium ionophore , but not by Cot kinase activity , in the absence of any additional stimulus ( Fig .
8B ) .

Model of activation of COX-2 gene expression by Cot kinase in T cells .
Induction Cox-2 in T cells upon T cell receptor triggering occurs mainly through activation of NFAT .
Cot kinase participates in this induction by activating NFAT-dependent transactivation signaling pathway in a CsA-insensitive manner thus acting downstream or in a parallel pathway to that mediated by calcineurin .
DISCUSSION COX-2 has been implicated in inflammation processes and is the target of many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( 19 ) .
More recently , COX-2 has been also associated with oncogenic transformation and angiogenesis ( 46-57 ) .
We have previously described that COX-2 is induced upon antigenic triggering in resting T cells , where it plays a role in controlling the process of T cell activation ( 20 , 21 ) .
In this report we have found that Cot kinase is involved in the regulation of COX-2 transcription in T cells .
The fact that a kinase-deficient mutant of Cot kinase blocked the activation of COX-2 promoter induced by « -CD3 and « -CD28 , as well as by phorbol esters plus calcium ionophore , indicates that Cot kinase or a Cot-like kinase plays a pivotal role in the up-regulation of COX-2 gene expression upon T cell activation .
Cot kinase regulates the activity of several transcription factors induced in T cell activation such as NFAT , AP-1 , or NF-kB ( 10-18 ) .
Previous results indicate that Cot kinase increases interleukin-2 gene expression ( 14-16 ) mainly by up-regulating the transcription driven by NF-kB and the composite element NFAT-AP-1 of interleukin-2 promoter ( 16 ) ; Cot kinase also up-regulates the AP-1 response element of the collagenase promoter ( 12 , 14 , 16 ) .
It has been shown that COX-2 promoter contains binding sites for these transcription factors , acting as positive regulatory elements of COX-2 transcription in several cell types ( 22-34 ) .
However , we have shown here that activation of COX-2 promoter in T cells occurs in a NF-kB-independent manner , in agreement with previous results discarding a role of this transcription factor in this cell type .
On the other hand , a dominant negative mutant of c-Jun inhibits PDBu plus calcium ionophore activation of COX-2 promoter , pointing to an important role of those signaling pathways leading to AP-1 activation ( 21 ) .
However , this mutant did not affect Cot kinase-mediated induction of Cox-2 promoter , suggesting that Cot could act through a c-Jun-independent pathway to activate this promoter .
Data obtained with the COX-2 promoter deletion constructs or with those with distal and proximal NFAT sites mutated , as well as the overexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT , indicate that NFAT is required for Cot-mediated or PDBu plus calcium ionophore up-regulation of COX-2 promoter .
The striking synergism between wtNFAT or ACAM-AI and Cot kinase and the fact that CsA did not inhibit Cot kinase-mediated Cox-2 promoter induction supports the hypothesis that Cot kinase-induced NFAT-dependent transacti- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Transcriptional Activation of Cyclooxygenase-2 by Cot Kinase vation is either downstream of calcineurin , or it represents a parallel pathway ( Fig .
9 ) .
Here , we show that Cot kinase mediated up-regulation of genes transactivated by NFAT occurs through the increase in the transactivation function of NFAT .
The Cot kinase induced-transactivation by NFAT described here can explain why Cot kinase up-regulates COX-2 promoter activity through their NFAT sites in addition to NFAT binding to these sites .
Moreover , the up-regulation of transactivation by NFAT and the induction of COX-2 promoter-driven transcription by Cot kinase are both CsA-independent and could also explain the reported CsA-insensitive activation of interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-a gene by Cot kinase in T cells ( 15 , 14 ) .
NFAT transcription factors are regulated at two different levels , primarily at the level of subcellular localization and secondarily at the level of the intrinsic DNA binding activity .
Tsatsanis et al .
( 15 ) have reported the regulation of NFAT by Cot kinase at the level of subcellular localization .
Thus , they have shown that overexpression of Cot kinase induces the nuclear accumulation of HA-NFATc in the 3T3 fibroblasts .
An integration of signal promoted by phorbol esters and calcium ionophore is required to increase the transactivation by NFAT ( 35 , 36 , 44 ) .
However , PDBu plus calcium ionophore activation of the NFAT transactivation domain is CsA-sensitive ( 85 , 36 , and this report ) in contrast to what we observed with Cot kinase .
In this context , it remains to be established whether the reported accumulation of NFATce by Cot kinase in the nucleus ( 15 ) is a consequence of the increase of transactivation function of NFAT triggered by Cot kinase which thereby retained it in the nucleus .
Another possibility is that Cot kinase regulates both the NFAT in/out shuttling of the nucleus and transactivation by NFAT by different ways , but with a common finality , to induce promoter transcription through NFAT response elements .
In conclusion , the data shown here indicate that Cot kinase controls COX-2 promoter activity mainly , if not exclusively , through the NFAT response elements .
We also provide evidence of a new mechanism of NFAT transcription factor activity up-regulation by Cot kinase which helps to explain the important role of this kinase in the regulation of gene expression after T cell activation .
Further analysis remains to be done to define the interactions between Cot kinase and the N-termi- nal transactivation domain of NFAT .
