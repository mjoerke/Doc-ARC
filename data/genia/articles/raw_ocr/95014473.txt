Mackmant From the Department of Immunology , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , California 92037 Tissue factor ( TF ) is expressed rapidly by human monocytes exposed to bacterial endotoxin ( lipopolysac-charide , or LPS ) .
Transcriptional regulation is mediated by binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a « B-like site in the TF promoter .
Nuclear translocation of cytosolic c-Rel/p65 heterodimers and other members of the NF- « B/Rel family requires dissociation and proteolytic degradation of the inhibitor protein , IxBa .
The protease inhibitors N*tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) and N®-tosyl-v-lysine chloromethyl ketone ( TLCK ) block activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins by preventing degradation of IxBa .
To determine if TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of TF expression , freshly isolated human monocytes and monocytic THP -1 cells were pretreated with these inhibitors for 30 min before LPS stimulation .
Both TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of TF protein , TF mRNA and TF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner .
These inhibitors specifically prevented degradation of IxBa « and nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
In contrast , TPCK and TLCK did not block induction of an immediate-early gene encoding the transcription fac-tor , Egr-1 .
Taken together , these data indicated that inhibiting nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers prevented LPS induction of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells .
Exposure of monocytes to bacterial endotoxin ( lipopolysac-charide , or LPS ] induces cell-surface expression of tissue factor ( TF ) , a potent procoagulant molecule that triggers the coagulation protease cascades ( 1 ) .
Monocytes may be the primary source of TF expression in animal models of sepsis ( 2-4 ) and in patients with septicemia ( 5 ) .
Indeed , studies using chimpanzees indicate that administration of pentoxifylline , an agent that inhibits gene activation in monocytes , markedly inhibits endotoxin-induced activation of coagulation ( 4 ) , presumably by reducing monocyte TF expression .
TF is rapidly and transiently expressed in human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells exposed to LPS ( 6 , 7 ) .
This induction is inhibited by agents that elevate intracellular levels of cyclic * This research was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant HL-48872 .

Regulation of TF expression is controlled primarily at the level of transcription ( 6 , 7 ) .
Functional studies in our laboratory using THP-1 cells indicate that a decameric xB-like site in the human TF promoter mediates LPS induction of the TF gene ( 18 ) .
Recently , we demonstrated that this xB-like site exclusively binds c-Rel/p65 heterodimers present in nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells ( 19 ) .
Therefore , LPS-mediated nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers and binding to the « B-like site in the TF promoter is required for induction of TF gene expression in monocytic cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
The NF- « B/Rel transcription factor family is implicated in the induction of many genes expressed by activated monocytes { reviewed in Ref .
20 ) .
Activation of members of the Rel family requires dissociation of inhibitor proteins , such as IxBa , before nuclear translocation of the transcription factors ( 21 ) .
In monocytic THP-1 cells , LPS-mediated activation of NF-kB is achieved through phosphorylation of IxBa ( 22 ) .
Other studies indicate that proteolytic degradation of IxBa also is required for activation of NF- « B ( 23 ) .
These studies show that the protease inhibitor N*-tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) , an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases , and the structurally related inhibitor N*-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone ( TLCK ) , an inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases , prevent activation of NF- « B by LPS , interleukin 18 , and tumor necrosis factor « ( 28 ) .
In this study , I demonstrated that LPS induction of TF expression in human monocytic cells was abolished by pretreating cells with the protease inhibitors TPCK and TLCK .
Inhibition was dose-dependent , although TPCK was a more potent inhibitor than TLCK .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) indicated that both agents inhibited the LPS-induced loss of IxBa protein and thus prevented nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , consistent with this transcription factor acting as a positive regulator of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells .

RESULTS Inhibition of LPS-induced TF Expression in Human Monocytic Cells-Recently , we demonstrated that activation of c-Rel/ p65 heterodimers is required for LPS induction of TF gene expression in human monocytic cells ( 19 ) , suggesting that agents capable of preventing activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins , such as the protease inhibitor TPCK , could inhibit LPS induction of TF expression .

Inhibition of LPS-induced TF antigen expression by human monocytes .
PBMC were incubated at 37 °C with LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) for 5 h with or without a 30-min pretreatment with TPCK ( 10 pum ) or TLCK ( 10 uw ) .
The control sample is PBMC incubated for 5 h without LPS or protease inhibitors .
Cells were stained with a FITC-labeled human TF-specific monoclonal antibody , TFS8-5G9 .
Expression of TF antigen was determined by FACS using live gating to analyze the monocyte population .
Results from a representative experiment are expressed as log fluorescence intensity versus cell number .
Mean channel fluorescence ( MCF ) for each sample is shown .
blocked LPS-induced TF expression in monocytic cells , TF antigen expression was measured in PBMC exposed to LPS ( 1 ug/ml ! )
for 5 h with or without a 30-min pretreatment with either TPCK or the structurally related protease inhibitor , TLCK .
LPS induction of TF antigen expression by PBMC , measured by FACS analysis , was abolished by TPCK ( 10 um ) but was unaffected by the same concentration of the less potent inhibitor TLCK ( Fig .
1 ) .
Similarly , LPS induction of TF activity expressed by PBMC and monocytic THP-1 cells , measured using a one-stage clotting assay , was abolished by TPCK ( 10 um ) and only slightly reduced by TLCK ( 10 um ) ( Fig .
2a ) .
The basal level of TF activity expressed by untreated PBMC ( Fig .
2a , C ) was reduced by simultaneous exposure to TPCK and LPS ( Fig .
2a ) , but not by TPCK ( 10 um ) alone ( data not shown ) .
The effect of TPCK was not a result of inhibition of procoagulant activity in the one-stage clotting assay because this inhibitor had no effect on clotting times when added to cells immediately before harvest ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , TPCK did not reduce cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion .
Dose titrations were performed using these inhibitors because previous studies indicated that TPCK inhibits activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins more effectively than TLCK ( 23 ) .
Pretreatment of cells with TPCK ( 0.1-2.5 um ) or TLCK ( 10-100 um ) led to a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced TF activity in PBMC ( Fig .
2b ) .
Induced TF activity was abolished by TPCK ( 1 um ) or TLCK ( 100 um ) , indicating that TPCK was a more potent inhibitor than TLCK .
Inhibition of LPS-induced TF mRNA Expression-To determine if TPCK inhibited LPS induction of TF mRNA , monocytic THP-1 cells were exposed to LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for 2 h with or without a 30-min pretreatment with this protease inhibitor .
Induction of TF mRNA was inhibited 79 % by TPCK ( 10 um ) , whereas the same concentration of TLCK led to only a 22 % inhibition ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similar results were observed at 4 h and TF mRNA levels declined to base-line level at 6 h ( data not shown ) .
TLCK ( 100 um ) abolished induction of TF mRNA ( data not shown ) .

Panel a , PBMC and THP-1 cells were exposed to 1 and 10 ug/ml LPS , respectively , for 5 h with or without a 30-min pretreatment with TPCK ( 10 um ) or TLCK ( 10 um ) .
Control samples were incubated for 5 h without LPS or protease inhibitors .
TF activity was determined using a one-stage clotting assay .
Mean -fold induction + standard deviation from three independent experiments is shown .
The level of TF activity expressed by uninduced PBMC and THP-1 cells was 285 + 69 milliunits/10® cells and 184 + 14 milliunits/10® cells , respectively .
Panel b , PBMC were incubated with TPCK ( 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 2.5 um ) or TLCK ( 10 , 25 , 50 , and 100 um ) for 30 min before addition of LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) for 5 h. TF activity was determined as above .

Inhibition of LPS-induced TF Gene Transcription-To determine if TPCK blocked LPS induction of TF gene transcription , THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the human TF promoter cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene .
Transfected cells were exposed to LPS ( 10 ug/m ! 1 ) for 5 h with or without a 30-min pretreatment with TPCK or TLCK .
Induction of luciferase activity expressed by pTF ( -278 ) LUC , which contains 278 base pairs of the TF promoter including the « B-like site at -179 , was abolished by TPCK ( 10 um ) and slightly reduced by TLCK ( 10 um ) ( Fig .
4a ) .
Further experiments were performed using p ( TF ) , SVLUC , a plasmid that contains four copies of the wild-type TF « B-like site cloned upstream of a minimal SV40 promoter ( 19 ) .
Induction of luciferase activity expressed by p ( TF ) , SVLUC was abolished by TPCK ( 10 um ) and unaffected by TLCK ( 10 um ) ( Fig .
4a ) .
In addition , TPCK and TLCK reduced LPS induction of luciferase activity expressed by pTF ( -278 ) LUC in a dose-dependent manner , abolishing induction at doses of 5 and 100 um , respectively ( Fig .
46 ) .
LPS Activation of c-Rel /p65 Heterodimers Was Inhibited by TPCK and TLCK-To determine if TPCK acted by preventing activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in human monocytic cells , nuclear extracts were prepared from freshly isolated monocytes 26365 TPCK ( 10uM ) - - -+ TLCK ( 10uM ) - LPS - + TF mRNA » ’ G6PDH + 1 2 3 4 Fic .

Inhibition of LPS-induced TF mRNA expression by THP-1 cells .
Total RNA was extracted from THP-1 cells exposed to LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for 2 h with or without a 30-min pretreatment with TPCK ( 10 pum ) or TLCK ( 10 um ) .
The control sample was incubated without LPS and protease inhibitors .
TF mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis using a radiolabeled human TF cDNA probe .
The blot was reprobed to determine glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GSPDH ) mRNA levels as a measure of RNA loading .
The position of the TF mRNA is indicated .
Band intensities were quantified by densitometric analysis using a Personal Densitometer and ImageQuant software ( Mo-lecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
The following results were obtained for TF mRNA levels : control , 100 ; LPS , 2663 ; TLCK + LPS , 2693 ; TPCK + LPS , 574 ; and for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels : control , 847 ; LPS , 1165 ; TLCK + LPS , 1502 ; TPCK + LPS , 1198 .
The percentage inhibition by TPCK and TLCK discussed in the text was calculated using TF mRNA levels normalized against glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels .
or THP cells exposed to LPS .
DNA binding proteins present in nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the TF « B-like site ( 19 ) .
LPS activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in monocytes and THP-1 cells was abolished by TPCK ( 10 um ) and slightly reduced by TLCK ( 10 um ) ( Fig .
5a ) .
The faster migrating complex observed in all lanes represents binding of nonspecific protein ( 19 ) .
LPS activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in THP-1 cells was inhibited by TPCK and TLCK in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
54 ) .
TPCK ( 5 um ) completely abolished c-Rel/p65 activation , whereas a 20 times higher concentration of TLCK ( 100 um ) was required to achieve a similar level of inhibition ( Fig .
5b ) .
LPS activation of NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) in THP cells also was inhibited by TPCK ( 10 um ) and TLCK ( 100 um ) ( data not shown ) .
These studies strongly suggest that TPCK and TLCK inhibit LPS induction of TF gene expression in human monocytic cells by preventing activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
Previous studies have shown that LPS activation of THP-1 cells results in a transient reduction of IxBa protein ( 22 ) .
To determine if TPCK and TLCK acted by stabilizing IxBa protein in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells , IxBa protein was monitored by Western blotting .
A 30-min pretreatment of cells with TPCK ( 5 or 10 um ) or TLCK ( 100 um ) abolished this transient reduction in I « kBa protein , whereas lower concentrations of TPCK ( 1 um ) and TLCK ( 10 un ) failed to prevent loss of IxBa protein ( Fig .
5b ) .
Thus , these protease inhibitors stabilized IxBa protein in LPS-stimulated monocytic THP-1 cells .
Induction of EGR-1 in Monocytic Cells Was Not Inhibited by Protease Inhibitors-To determine the specificity of inhibition by TPCK and TLCK , induction of the immediate-early gene , egr-1 , was examined in the absence or presence of these protease inhibitors at concentrations that completely blocked activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins and induction of TF expression .
Previous studies indicated that egr-1 gene expression is induced in monocytic cells exposed to phorbol esters ( 29 ) .

Inhibition of LPS-induced TF gene transcription in THP-1 cells .
Panel a , pTF ( -278 ) LUC and p ( TF ) , SVLUC were transfected into THP-1 cells using DEAE-dextran .
After 46 h , cells were divided into four equal portions which were either untreated ( control , C ) or exposed to LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for 5 h with or without a pretreatment with TPCK ( 10 um ) or TLCK ( 10 um ) .
Luciferase activity ( light units ) was measured in four independent experiments to determine -fold inductions + standard experimental mean ( S.E . ) .
Luciferase activity expressed by pTF ( -278 ) LUC was induced 6.2 + 2.5-fold , and luciferase activity expressed by p ( TF ) , SVLUC was induced 54.5 + 16-fold .
Luciferase activity expressed by control samples was 7205 + 1289 for pTF ( -278 ) LUC and 12941 + 1849 for p ( TF ) , SVLUC .
Panel b , THP-1 cells transfected with pTF ( -278 ) LUC were incubated in the absence of LPS or with a 30-min pretreatment with TPCK ( 0.1 , 1.0 , 2.5 , and 5.0 um ) or TLCK ( 10 , 25 , 50 , and 100 um ) before the addition of LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for 5 h. The mean -fold induction + S.E .
of luciferase activity was determined as above .
LPS induced luciferase expression 5.9 + 2.8-fold .
gene encodes a transcription factor that can be measured using a gel shift assay .
PMA induction of EGR-1 expression in THP-1 cells was not affected by pretreating the cells with TPCK ( 10 um ) or TLCK ( 100 um ) ( Fig .
6 ) .
The EGR-1 complex was characterized by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either an EGR-1 site or an AP-1 site , as well as with specific antibodies ( Fig .
6 ) .
The radiolabeled oligonucleotide also bound Sp1 , which was constitutively expressed in THP-1 cells .
Similarly , PMA induction of EGR-1 mRNA was not prevented by TPCK or TLCK ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , TPCK and TLCK were not general inhibitors of transcription in monocytic cells exposed to LPS .
DISCUSSION This study demonstrated that the protease inhibitors TPCK and TLCK reduced LPS induction of TF expression in monocytic cells in a dose-dependent manner .
TPCK was a more potent inhibitor than the structurally related inhibitor , TLCK .

Inhibition of LPS activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in monocytic cells .
Panel a , nuclear extracts were prepared from freshly isolated human monocytes or THP-1 cells incubated for 2 h with 1 or 10 ug/ml of LPS , respectively , with or without a 30-min pretreatment with TPCK ( 10 um ) or TLCK ( 10 um ) .
The presence of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers was determined by EMSA using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the kB-like site from the TF promoter ( 19 ) .
LPS stimulation of monocytes and THP-1 cells activated c-Rel/p65 heterodimers ( arrow ) .
The faster migrating band observed in all lanes represents nonspecific protein binding ( 19 ) .
The c-Rel/p65 complex from monocytes is partially degraded by proteolysis during the isolation pro-cedure , despite the use of protease inhibitors .
Panel b , THP-1 cells were pretreated for 30 min with TPCK ( 1 , 5 , and 10 um ) or TLCK ( 10 and 100 um ) before addition of LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for 2 h. Activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers was determined by EMSA as above .
IxBa protein in parallel cytosolic extracts was detected by Western blotting .
Treatment of cells that resulted in decreased IxBa protein in cytosolic extracts was associated with the presence of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in nuclear extracts ( lanes 2 , 3 , and 6 ) .
LPS-induced TF expression was abolished by 10 um TPCK and only slightly reduced by the same concentration of TLCK .
However , 100 um TLCK abolished induced TF expression .
These data are similar to the relative potency of these inhibitors reported for blocking activation of NF-kB ( 23 ) .
Nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in monocytic cells was prevented by TPCK and TLCK at concentrations that blocked proteolytic degradation of IxBa « , suggesting that activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers was regulated by IxBa .
Previous studies have shown that IxBa can bind to either p65 or c-Rel ( 30 , 31 ) .
Taken together , these data indicated that nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers was required for LPS induction of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells .
LPS stimulation of cells leads to a transient loss of IxBa « protein , indicating that activation of NF-kB/Rel proteins re Inhibition of Tissue Factor Expression AB .

Induction of EGR-1 expression in monocytic cells .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from THP-1 cells incubated with PMA ( 100 ng/ml ) for 2 h with or without a 30-min pretreatment with TPCK ( 10 um ) or TLCK ( 100 um ) .
The presence of EGR-1 protein was determined by EMSA .
Sp1 also bound to this radiolabeled oligonucleotide .
Competition studies used a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either an EGR-1 site ( E ) or an AP-1 site ( A ) .
The EGR-1 complex also was analyzed using antisera ( 5 ul ) against EGR-1 ( a-E ) , AP-2 ( « -A2 ) , or Spl ( « -S ) .
quires release and subsequent proteolytic degradation of IxBa ( 22 , 32 ) .
Furthermore , protease inhibitors prevent loss of IxBa and block activation of NF- « B ( 23 ) .
However , these studies did not investigate if TPCK also blocked LPS-induced gene expression .
More recently , TPCK was shown to prevent LPS induction of IkxBa mRNA in 70 % /3 cells ( 33 ) .
These authors argued that TPCK was not a general inhibitor of transcription because the levels of the long-lived glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase mRNA were unchanged .
Similar data was noted with the short-lived c-fos mRNA , although this data was not shown ( 33 ) .
In this study , specificity of inhibition by TPCK and TLCK was shown by analyzing PMA induction of EGR-1 expression in monocytic THP-1 cells .
These protease inhibitors did not block induction of EGR-1 protein or mRNA expression at concentrations that abolished LPS induction of TF expression .
Therefore , TPCK and TLCK specifically inhibited activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins and were not general inhibitors of transcription in monocytic cells .
Exposure of monocytic cells to LPS stimulates the rapid nuclear translocation of NF- « B/Rel proteins .
These transcription factors regulate expression of many primary response genes , including those encoding the cytokines tumor necrosis factor a , IL-1 $ , and IL-6 , and those encoding NF- « B/Re ! l proteins them-selves , such as p50 , c-Rel , and IxBa ( 34 ) ( reviewed in Ref .
20 ) .
These genes contain « B sites that match the established consensus sequence .
In contrast , « B-like sites in the human TF and IL-8 promoters do not match this consensus sequence .
They fail to bind prototypic p50/p65 heterodimers and instead bind c-Rel/p65 heterodimers ( 19 ) , suggesting that there is a subset of inducible genes expressed by monocytes that are regulated by c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
Binding of different members of the NF- « B/Rel family to distinct classes of kB and « B-like sites represents an important mechanism for selective control of gene expression .
In septic shock , monocytes and endothelial cells are the only cell types within the vasculature that express TF ( 35-38 ) .
Recent studies in our laboratory showed that activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers also is required for LPS and cytokine induction of the TF gene in human endothelial cells ( 39 ) .
Furthermore , inducible TF expression in endothelial cells is 26367 blocked by TPCK and TLCK ( 39 ) .
Therefore , inducible expression of the TF gene in monocytes and endothelial cells appears to be controlled by a common regulatory mechanism .
Specific inhibitors that prevent activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in these two cell types in vivo may represent novel antithrom-botic drugs for use in the treatment of a variety of thrombotic disorders .
