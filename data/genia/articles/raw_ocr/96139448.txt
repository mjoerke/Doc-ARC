One of the putative targets of calcineurin is the pre-existing , cytosolic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFATp ; also referred to as NFAT1 ) , which is one of several transcription factors required for the expression of interleukin 2 .
Inhibition of calcineurin by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 prevents dephosphorylation of NFAT p and its translocation to the nucleus .
However , a physical interaction between calcineurin and NFATp has not been demonstrated .
Here we demonstrate the binding of NFAT p from lysates of T cells to immobilized calcineurin .
Stimulation of T cells with calcium ionophore induced a shift in the molecular weight of NFAT p that is due to its dephosphorylation .
This dephosphorylation was inhibited by treatment of T cells with cyclosporin A or FK506 prior to stimulation .
Of note , both the phosphorylated and the dephosphorylated form of NFATp bound to calcineurin .
Furthermore , the binding of both forms of NFATp to calcineurin was inhibited by pretreatment of calcineurin with a complex of FK506 and its ligand FKBP12 .
Taken together these data strongly suggest a direct interaction of calcineurin with NFATp and that this interaction does not depend upon the phos-phorylation sites of NFAT p affected by activation .
The calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin ( PP2B ) plays a crucial role in T cell activation .

Printed in U.S.A. erodimer , composed of a 59-kDa calmodulin-binding catalytic subunit and a 19-kDa Ca**-binding regulatory subunit that is required for enzymatic activity .
The central role of calcineurin in T cell signaling was appreciated by its identification as the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 ( 1 , 2 ) .
The phosphatase activity of CN is inhibited by either drug when complexed to intracellular binding proteins ( immunophilins ) , i.e .
CsA to cyclophilin and FK506 to the FK506-binding protein 12 ( FKBP12 ) , respectively .
Neither drug nor immunophilin alone bind to or affect the activity of CN ( 2 ) .
In T lymphocytes both CsA and FK506 inhibit a variety of T cell responses .
A well characterized example of the effect of CsA and FK506 is the inhibition of T cell receptor-mediated expression of cytokine genes ( 3-5 ) .
Among the putative targets of calcineurin is the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) ( 6 ) , which regulates , in part , the expression of a number of cytokine genes including IL-2 , IL-3 ( 7 ) , IL-4 ( 8 , 9 ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulat-ing factor ( 7 ) , and tumor necrosis factor a ( 10 ) .
Within the IL-2 promoter , NFAT consists of a pre-existing , cytoplasmic component and an ubiquitously expressed nuclear component , which contains members of the AP1 family of transcription factors ( 11 , 12 ) .
NFATp is one of several isoforms of the cytosolic component of NFAT ( 13-16 ) .
Increases in intracellular calcium induce the translocation of the cytosolic component of NFAT to the nucleus , where NFATp interacts with the AP1 elements Fos and Jun and binds to its cognate DNA-binding site .
The calcium-dependent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT cytoplasmic components are inhibited by CsA and FK506 whereas the generation of the nuclear components is unaffected ( 11 , 17-20 ) .
It has been further demonstrated that CN dephosphorylates NFATp in vitro and that the dephosphorylated form of NFATp binds with a higher affinity to an NFAT oligonucleotide ( 20 , 21 ) .
Moreover , it has been shown that CN phosphatase activity correlates with T cell receptor-induced IL-2 expression in vitro and in vivo ( 22-24 ) .
Thus it appears that CN plays a central role in transducing T cell receptor-mediated signals to the nucleus .
However , it has not been determined whether the influence of CN on the nuclear translocation of the cytosolic forms of NFAT is due to a direct or indirect interaction .
In this report we show that purified bovine CN immobilized to calmodulin Sepharose beads precipitates NFATp from lysates of a murine T cell line .
Of note , CN associated with both the phosphorylated as well as the dephosphorylated form of NFATp .
The interaction of CN with NFATp was inhibited by the complex of FK506-FKBP12 but not by either FK506 or FKBP12 alone .
The finding of a physical association of CN with NFATp supports a model whereby CN is directly involved in dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATp .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells-The CD4* CD8* murine T cell hybridoma BYDP ( 25 ) was grown in RPMI 1640 complete medium ( RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum , 5 % iron-supplemented calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin , and 2 X 10 `` M B-mer-captoethanol ) .

Subsequently 500-ul lysates of 10 '' cells were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C .
Beads were washed four times with precipitation wash buffer ( 0.2 % Triton X-100 , 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.4 , 10 % glycerol , 1 mm CaCl , , 5 mM NaF , 1 mM Na , VO , , 4 ug/ml aprotinin , 4 ug/ml leupeptin , 1 ug/ml pepstatin A , 30 ug/ml trypsin inhibitor ) .

Proteins bound to calmodulin-Sepharose beads were separated by 8-12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore Corp. , Bedford , MA ) , immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies , and developed by the enhanced chemi-luminescence ( ECL ) system ( Amersham Corp. ) .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Stimulation of T Cells with Calcium Ionophore Induces a Shift in Relative Mobility of NFATp-Murine hybridoma T cells ( BYDP ) were stimulated for 5 min with the calcium iono-phore , ionomycin , the protein kinase C-activating phorbol es-ter , PMA , or with both agents .
Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antiserum raised against NFATp ( 13 ) .
Two major forms of NFAT p were visualized by Western blotting .
In unstimulated T cells and T cells stimulated with PMA alone , NFAT p had an molecular mass of ~134 kDa .
Stimulation with ionomycin or ionomycin plus PMA induced a downward shift in the molecular mass of NFAT p to a band of ~113 kDa ( Fig .
14 ) .
The induction of this shift has been previously demonstrated to be due to the dephosphorylation of NFATp ( 19-21 ) .
PMA alone did not elicit a shift in mobility of NFATp , indicating that a rise in intracellular calcium concentration is sufficient to induce dephosphorylation of NFATp .
In order to evaluate the time course of the dephosphorylation of NFATp , T hybridoma cells were stimulated with ionomycin ; whole cell lysates were prepared at the indicated time points , resolved by SDS-PAGE , and immunoblotted with NFATp-antiserum ( Fig .
1B ) .
Thus , ionomycin induced a rapid shift in mobility of NFATp after 5 min , which was maintained for 8 h in the continuous presence of ionomycin and reverted to the slower migrating , phosphorylated form after 19 h. The rephosphorylation of NFATp is consistent with the observation that 5 h after T cell receptor activation NFATp translocates to o £ Cee w © 8 & A $ 6 # # # 0 0 .

* Calcineurin Associates with Both M , Forms of NFATp in Vitro-Calcineurin is thought to be involved in the dephosphorylation and subsequent translocation of NFAT p from the cytoplasm to the nucleus since inhibition of calcineurin activity by the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and CsA inhibits nuclear translocation of cytosolic NFAT ( 11 , 17 ) .
Therefore , we investigated whether NFATp , in T cell lysates ( BYDP cells ) , associates with exogenous calcineurin in vitro .
T cell lysates were incubated with purified calcineurin from bovine brain immobilized to calmodulin-Sepharose ( CaM beads ) .
In order to inhibit phosphatase activity of CN we included the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride and sodium pyrophosphate during incubation .
In lysates of unstimulated T cells , CN bound to the higher ( phosphorylated ) M , form of NFATp whereas in lysates of T cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin , CN associated with the lower ( dephosphorylated ) form ( Fig .
2 ) .
Thus , immobilized CN bound both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of NFATp .
CN activity in T cells was inhibited in vivo by preincubating T cells with FK506 , and this resulted in the inhibition of the activation-induced dephosphorylation of NFAT .
When rapamycin was added in a 100-fold excess to FK506 , the FK506-mediated inhibition of NFATp dephosphorylation was reversed ( Fig .
2 ) .
Since rapamycin and FK506 bind competitively to FKBP12 , but the complex of rapamycin~FKBP12 does not bind to CN ( 2 ) , the reversal by rapamycin of FK506-mediated inhibition of the stimulation-induced shift of NFAT p supports the involvement of CN in the dephosphorylation of NFATp in vivo .
Preincubation of CN/CaM Beads with Exogenous FK506 : FKBP12 in Vitro Inhibits NFATp Binding to CN-It has previously been demonstrated that the complex of FK506 with its intracellular ligand FKBP12 binds to and inhibits the phosphatase activity of CN in vitro ( 2 ) .
Since we could demonstrate a physical interaction of CN with NFATp , we investigated the effect of the FK506-FKBP12 complex on the association of CN and NFATp in vitro .
CaM beads were incubated with purified 2 C. Loh , J. Kim , P. G. Hogan , and A. Rao , submitted for publication .

Calcineurin associates with phosphorylated and dephosphorylated NFATp and FK506-FKBP12 inhibits this interaction .
T cells were incubated with the immunosuppressants FK506 ( F , 0.1 pM ) , 0.1 um FK506 plus 10 uM rapamycin ( R+F ) , or in medium with ethanol ( 0.2 % ) as diluent control for 30 min at 37 °C .
Subsequently cells were activated with ionomycin ( 2 uM ) and PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) or ethanol control ( 0.2 % ) for 5 min at 37 °C .
Activated ( + ) or nonactivated ( - ) cells were lysed .
500 pl of lysates were added to calmodulin-Sepharose beads ( CaM ) that had been preincubated for 30 min with or without purified CN ( 0.2 uM ) in the presence of FK506 ( F , 40 um ) and purified FKBP12 ( BP , 4 pM ) or ethanol control ( 4 % ) in a volume of 250 ul .
After an additional 60-min incubation , calmodulin-Sepharose beads and associated proteins were washed and incubated with FK506 plus FKBP12 ( F+BP ) or ethanol in the same concentrations and volume as during preincubation .
After additional washes precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with NFATp antiserum .
The arrows indicate the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of precipitated NFAT p. CN in the presence of FK506 and purified FKBP12 before adding lysates of stimulated or unstimulated T cells .
It was observed that once the complex of CN , FKBP12 , and FK506 was formed , NFAT p from either unactivated or activated T cell lysates could no longer bind to CN ( Fig .
2 ) .
Interestingly , once NFATp was associated with CN in vitro , the addition of the FK506-FKBP12 complex could not disrupt this interaction .
Specifically , NFATp bound to CN/CaM beads could not be `` eluted '' with FK506-FKBP12 ( Fig .
2 ) .
In order to assess the specificity of the FK506 : FKBP12-me-diated inhibition of NFATp to CN , rapamycin was added in 100-fold excess to FK506 during preincubation of CN/CaM beads and GST-FKBP12 with or without FK506 .
After prein-cubation , lysates of activated or nonactivated T cells were added , and proteins associated with CN/CaM beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-NFATp , anti-CN ( data not shown ) , or anti-FKBP12 antibodies ( Fig .
3 ) .
Preincubation of CN/CaM beads with FK506 and FKBP12 ( GST-FKBP12 ) led to the binding of FK506-FKBP12 to CN and the inhibition of the interaction of CN with NFATp .
Only the combination of both FKBP12 plus FK506 blocked the binding of NFATp to CN ; neither drug nor immunophilin alone had any effect on the association nor did rapamycin~FKBP12 .
Inhibition by FK506-FKBP12 was mediated by blocking the binding of CN to NFATp and not by disturbing the interaction of CN with CaM , since immunoblots for CN revealed no loss of CN ( pre-cipitated via CaM beads ) in the presence of FK506 : -FKBP12 ( data not shown ) .
Addition of rapamycin in 100-fold excess to FK506 restored the association of NFAT p to CN , thus reversing the effect of FK506-FKBP12 on the CN/NFATp interaction ( Fig .
3 ) .
Although the presence of FK506 is necessary for optimal binding of FKBP12 to CN some binding of FKBP12 alone to CN/CaM beads was noted .
It has been reported that FK506-FKBP12 inhibits the phosphatase activity of CN on protein/peptide substrates but not on small organic substrates such as para-nitrophenyl phosphate ( 2 ) .
This finding suggests that the complex of FK506-FKBP12 inhibits substrate binding to CN rather than affecting the phosphatase activity of CN .
It further implies that the catalytic domain of CN consists of at least two sites : a substrate-binding site and a catalytic site .

Rapamycin restores the FK506-FKBP12-inhibited association of CN with NFATp .
A , 500-4ul lysates of activated ( + ) or nonactivated ( - ) T cells ( stimulated as in Fig .
2 ) were added to calmodulin-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated for 60 min with or without purified CN ( 0.2 uM ) in the presence of FK506 ( 4 pM ) , rapamycin ( Rapa , 400 uM ) , ethanol ( 4 % ) as control , and/or purified GST-FKBP12 ( 4 pM ) in a volume of 250 ul .
After incubation for an additional 60 min , calmodulin-Sepharose beads were washed , and precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with NFATp antiserum or FKBP12 antiserum ( B ) .
( ii ) these interactions are inhibited by FK506-FKBP12 supports the notion that the major interaction of CN with NFAT p occurs via the substrate-binding site rather than the catalytic site .
The recently solved x-ray crystallographic structure of FK506-FKBP12 bound to CN revealed that the FK506-FKBP12 complex binds to the A-chain of CN at a site approximately 10 A removed from the catalytic site ( 27 ) .
This structural information is consistent with our data , suggesting that the interaction of NFATp with the catalytic site is not a requirement for binding .
Though we were able to demonstrate the binding of NFAT p to CN , we could not exclude the possibility of a third protein involved in this interaction .
While it has been shown that CsA and FK506 inhibit the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATp , it has not yet been demonstrated whether the influence of CN on the nuclear translocation of the cytosolic form of NFAT is due to a direct or indirect interaction .
In the direct model , CN dephosphorylates NFAT directly , thereby enabling it to cross the nuclear membrane .
Thus , the nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic component of NFAT would be regulated by dephosphorylation , as has been shown for the regulation of the yeast transcription factor SWI5 ( 28 , 29 ) .
Al-ternatively , the indirect model takes into account that all four isoforms of the cytosolic component of NFAT contain a region similar to the Rel homology domain of the NFB family ( 14-16 ) .
It has , therefore , been suggested that NFAT in nonactivated T cells might be retained by a cytosolic anchoring protein , in a similar manner as NFB is retained by I « B ( 30 ) .
Dephosphorylation of the putative anchoring protein by CN would then result in the release of NFAT and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus ( 31 ) .
The finding that CN associates with phosphorylated and dephosphorylated NFATp favors a model of a direct interaction of CN with NFATp for the following reasons .
( i ) It has been demonstrated that dephosphorylated NFATp is able to trans-locate to the nucleus ( 19 , 20 ) .
In case NFATp is released from a cytosolic anchoring protein after activation it is unlikely that CN associates with NFATp via a cytosolic anchoring protein , since NFATp would already be released .
( ii ) The known NFxB anchoring proteins , « B , , and I « B , degrade 10 min and 4 h after stimulation , respectively ( 32 ) .
Nuclear translocation of NFATp takes place 5-10 min after stimulation ( 19 , 20 ) , indicating that if NFATp is retained in the cytosol by an IxB-like anchoring protein it must be released from this protein and from CN 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Physical Interaction of Calcineurin with NFATp 118 - an ap an # # an ae # D we ae < - NFATp 97 Fig .

CN associates with NFATp up to 6 h after stimulation .
CN/CaM-Sepharose beads were incubated with 500-pl lysates of T cells stimulated with 2 pM ionomycin for the indicated amount of time .
After a 60-min incubation , calmodulin-Sepharose beads were washed , and precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with NFATp antiserum .
The arrow indicates the dephosphorylated form of NFATp .
within 5-10 min .
Since we could demonstrate that CN/CaM beads precipitate NFATp from lysates of T cells stimulated for up to 6 h ( Fig .
4 ) it is unlikely that NFATp would still associate with CN via an I « B-like protein .
Therefore , our observation of a physical interaction of CN and NFATp , together with the fact that phosphorylated NFAT p can serve as a substrate for CN in vitro ( 21 ) , supports a model in which CN is directly involved in the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NFATp .
