The function of LEF-1 is dependent , in part , on the HMG domain that induces a sharp bend in the DNA helix , and on an activation domain that stimulates transcription only in a specific context of other enhancer-binding proteins .
With the aim of gaining insight into the function of context-dependent activation domains , we cloned ALY , a novel LEF-1-interacting protein .
ALY is a ubiquitously expressed , nuclear protein that specifically associates with the activation domains of LEF-1 and AML-1 ( CBF « 2 , PEBP2 « B ) , which is another protein component of the TCRa « enhancer complex .
In addition , ALY can increase DNA binding by both LEF-1 and AML proteins .
Overexpression of ALY stimulates the activity of the TCRa enhancer complex reconstituted in transfected nonlymphoid HeLa cells , whereas down-regulation of ALY by anti-sense oligonucleotides virtually eliminates TCRa « enhancer activity in T cells .
Similar to LEF-1 , ALY can stimulate transcription in the context of the TCRa « enhancer but apparently not when tethered to DNA through an heterologous DNA-binding domain .
We propose that ALY mediates context-dependent transcriptional activation by facilitating the functional collaboration of multiple proteins in the TCRa enhancer complex .

Cell type-specific gene expression is governed by complex cis-acting control regions that are composed of multiple DNA-binding sites for transcription factors , allowing for diversity and accuracy in transcriptional regula-tion .
Both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions are thought to contribute to the specificity of assembly and function of higher order nucleoprotein complexes .
Typical transcriptional activators contain two , often separable , functional domains : one that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding and one that mediates the actual trans-activation event ( Ptashne 1988 ) .
Another class of transcriptional regulatory proteins , referred to as architectural factors , are DNA-binding proteins that induce directed bends in DNA and facilitate interactions between proteins bound at nonadjacent sites within complex regulatory DNA elements ( for review , see Tjian and Maniatis 1994 ; Grosschedl 1995 ) .
One of the founding members of this group is lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 { LEF-1 ) , a member of the family of high mobility group ( HMG ) domain proteins ( Travis et al .
1991 ; Waterman et al .
1991 ; Landsman and Bustin 1993 ; Grossched ] et al .
1994 ) .
The HMG domain *Corresponding author .

1992 ; Love et al .
1995 ) .
Functionally , LEF-1 is not capable of activating transcription directly from multimerized binding sites but operates when bound to DNA within the context of specific arrangements of other factor-binding sites ( Waterman and Jones 1990 ; Travis et al .
1991 ) .
The mechanistic role of LEF-1 in mediating cell type-specific transcription in a natural context has been explored in detail at the T-cell receptor « ( [ TCRa ) enhancer and at the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) enhancer ( Giese et al .
1995 ; Sheridan et al .
1995 ) .
The 112-bp minimal TCRe enhancer contains a centrally located LEF-l -binding site , an upstream binding site for a member of the activating transcription factor/cAMP response element-binding ( ATF/CREB ) family , and three downstream binding sites for two different lymphoid-specific factors ( Ho and Leiden 1990 ; Giese et al .
1995 ) .
Two of the downstream sites bind members of the acute myeloid leukemia factor { ( AML ) family , also termed core-binding factor ( CBFa ; Wang et al .
1993 ) or polyoma enhancer-binding protein 2 ( [ PEBP2a ; Ogawa et al .
1993a ) .

1993a ; Wang et al .
1993 ; Bae et al .
1994 , 1995 ; Levanon et al .
1994 ) .
The AML-binding sites in the TCRa enhancer are located adjacent to a binding site for Ets-1 at the 3 ' end of the enhancer .
Although AML proteins cooperate with Ets-1 to bind DNA , the ternary complex is unstable in vitro and shows little ability to activate transcription in vivo ( Giese et al .
1995 ) .
Studies of the TCRa enhancer have revealed two distinct context-dependent functions of LEF-1 , an architectural function and a transcription activation function .
The architectural role of LEF-1 is mediated by the HMG domain that , by inducing a directed DNA bend in the enhancer , is thought to facilitate interactions between factors bound at the ATF/CREB-binding sites and AML : Ets-binding sites , which are necessary for the formation of a stable enhancer complex ( Giese et al .
1995 ] .
The context-dependent transcription activation functions of LEF-1 are mediated by regions outside of the carboxy-terminally located HMG domain .
Analysis of chimeric proteins in which the HMG domain of LEF-1 was replaced by heterologous DNA-binding domains delineated a context-dependent activation domain [ CAD ) between residues 99 and 217 of LEF-1 ( Carlsson et al .
1993 ; Giese and Grosschedl 1993 ) .
This region differs from typical activation domains in that it is unable to stimulate transcription from multimerized binding sites but rather , activates transcription when tethered to DNA in the context of the natural arrangement of factor-binding sites in the TCRa enhancer or the HIV enhancer { Carlsson et al .
1993 ; Giese and Grosschedl 1993 ; Sheridan et al .
1995 ) .
A molecular explanation for the function of the context-dependent activation domain of LEF-1 remains un-clear .
One simple model is that these regions interact , directly or indirectly , with other enhancer-bound factors .
Previous attempts to identify direct LEF-1 interactions with other known TCRa « enhancer-binding factors have been unsuccessful ( Giese et al , 1995 ) .
Here we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate LEF-l-interacting proteins that may contribute to its transcription activation functions .
We have identified a novel , nuclear protein that interacts with two TCRa enhancer-bound factors , LEF-1 and AML-1 .
We show that this factor is required for TCRa enhancer function in T cells and plays a role in regulating the activity of this multiprotein enhancer complex .
Results Cloning of cDNAs encoding LEF-1-interacting proteins To identify proteins that interact and functionally collaborate with LEF-1 , we used the yeast two-hybrid assay ( Fields and Song 1989 ) .
For the screen , we used a LEF-1-LexA fusion protein in which the HMG domain of LEF-1 was replaced with the DNA-binding domain of LexA { Giese and Grosschedl 1993 ) .
We screened an embryonic day 10 mouse cDNA library in which the cDNA inserts ALY , a LEF-1- and AML-l-interacting protein are fused to sequences encoding a VP16 transcription activation domain ( Hollenberg et al .
1995 ) .
From ~2.7 x 10° yeast transformants , eight library plasmids were isolated that conferred reporter gene activation only in combination with the LEF-1-LexA fusion construct but not with three control LexA fusion proteins , lamin , Ste3 , and Fus1 .
Four of these contained identical inserts of 230 bp and one contained a longer 310-bp insert from the same gene .
The 310-bp insert was used as a probe to isolate full-length 1.1-kb cDNA clones that encode 255 amino acids followed by stop codons in all three reading frames ( Fig .
1 } .
On the basis of its ability to interact with LEF-1 and AML-1 ( see below } , we refer to the protein product of this cDNA as ALY ( Ally of AML-1 and LEF-1 ) .
The size of the open reading frame ( ORF ) of the ALY cDNA corresponds well with the 32-kD molecular mass of recombinant ALY polypeptide transcribed and translated in vitro ( see Fig .
3B , below ] , and with the size of the endogenous protein that can be detected on immunoblots by polyclonal antibodies directed against ALY ( data not shown ) .
Amino acid sequence comparison of ALY with proteins in the GenBank database revealed no identities but did reveal potential homology with RNA-binding proteins .
In particular , the protein contains a putative RNP { ribonucleoprotein } ) RNA recognition motif and Arg/ GATCCGAGGCCCGAATCCGCGCCCGCCATGGCCGACAAAATGGACATGTCTTTGGACGAC 60 M A D k M D M S L D D 11 120 I I K L N R S Q R G G ROG G G R G R G R 31 180 A G s q G G R G G A V Q A A A R V N R G 51 GSCGSqCCTATGACGAACCGGCCCGCCATCGCCCCECGSCGCCECAGCCGSCGCCAGGAAC 240 G G P M R N R P A I A R G A A G G G R N 71 CGSCCGSCGCCGTACAGCAGACCGAAACAACTTCCCGACAAATGGCAGCACCACCTCTTC 300 RO PA B X s R P K g L R D K Ww o H D L F 91 GACAGCGGCTTCGGGGGTGGAGCCGGCGTGGAGACCGGCGGSAAGCTGCTECTETCCAAC 360 D _s @ F § g @ A G V E T G @ k L L vy s N 111 CTGGACTTCGGAGTGTCAGATGCTGATATTCAGGAACTCTTTGCTGAATTTGGGACATTIG 420 L D F G Y s D A D I g E L R A ROP G T L 131 AAAAAAGCTGCTGTGCACTATGATCGCTCTGGACGAAGTTTAGGGACAGCAGATGTGCAC 480 K K A A V H Y D R S § R S L G T A D v H 151 TTTGAACGGAAAGCAGATGCCCTGAAGGCTATGAAACAGTACAATGGTGTCCCTTPGGAT 540 EO ER K A D A L_ K A MK Q Y N G Y P L D 171 GGCCGCCCTATGAACATCCAGCTTGTCACATCACAGATTCATACACAGCGAAGACCTGCA - 600 G R OB M N I Q L v T S Q I D T Q R R P A 191 CAGAGCATAAACAGAGGCGGCATGACAAGAAACCGTGECTCTGGAGGTTTTGGTGGTGGT 660 Q s I N R G G M T R N R G 8 @ G F G cos 211 GGCACCAGGAGAGGGACACGTGGAGGCAGCCGGGGAAGAGGTAGAGCGCACCGGCAGGAAC 720 G T R R G T R G G S8 R G R G R G T G R N 231 TCAAAGCAGCAGCTTTCTGCAGAGGAGTTGGACGCACACGCTGGATGCTTACAATGCAAGG 780 § K Q Q L s A E E L D A Q L D A ¥ N A R 251 ATGGACACCAGCTAAACAACTGAGCAAATCCACACAAGTAACAGGACCCAGAAGCCTCGC 840 MoD T Ss * 255 CTETGATGCCTAGAGGGAGGGTTGGCAACTGAACTGTGCAGACAATCGTGGATTTGTPEE 900 GTTTCTTTPPATTTCTITTCITPTTTTTTICTTCCTGTTTTAAAATAGGATCTAAAAAC - 960 TCATGTAAAGTTTTTNTTTITICTTTTITGGTTTTTETITTCTTTPPTCTTTPPPPPPT 1020 TAATTCTGAAACAGACCTGTTTTCTACTGAGTTATITTTGGGATAAATATTACTGGTTGC 1080 TGTTGTGGAGAAGGTGGCATTTTCACCTTIGCCATAATAAAATAGAAATGTG 1132 Figure 1 .

Gly-rich regions in the amino and carboxyl termini that are loosely homologous to RGG RNA-binding motifs [ for review , see Burd and Dreyfuss 1994 ) .
Biochemical and structural studies of RNP domains have shown that they are sufficient to mediate RNA binding and that three highly conserved aromatic amino acids found in the RNP ( RNP octamer ) and RNP2 ( RNP hexamer ) sequences are involved in critical stacking interactions with RNA bases ( for review , see Nagai et al .
1995 ) .
However , the putative RNP and RNP2 sequences of ALY ( Fig .
1 , bold underlined ) contain only a single aromatic amino acid .
Moreover , preliminary studies demonstrated that ALYANC , which includes the putative RNP domain , is not capable of binding RNA at any detectable level , although very weak nonspecific binding to RNA and DNA was observed with full-length ALY protein { data not shown ) .
Thus , ALY may represent a protein that is related to RNA-binding proteins and has some propensity to interact with nucleic acids , but in which the RNP domain may perform other functions .
ALY encodes a ubiquitously expressed , nuclear protein To examine the expression pattern of ALY , we analyzed poly { A ) * RNA from various mouse tissues and cell lines for the presence of transcripts that hybridize with an ALY cDNA probe .
A single 1.1 -kb ALY transcript was detected at varying levels in all tissues and cell lines examined suggesting that ALY may be expressed ubiquitously ( Fig .
2 ) .
The subcellular localization of ALY was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of COST cells that had been transfected transiently with a plasmid expressing a T7 epitope-tagged version of ALY .
This approach was necessary because our anti-ALY an-tiserum failed to recognize native protein [ data not shown ) .
By comparing the immunofluorescence staining of T7Z-ALY with DAPI staining of DNA , we detected ALY primarily in the nucleus of transfected cells ( Fig .
2C , D ) } .
We conclude from these results that ALY is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein .
ALY interacts with LEF-1 and AML proteins To establish that full-length ALY can interact directly with LEF-1 , we performed in vitro association assays with purified recombinant glutathionine S-trasferase ( GSTJ-ALY fusion protein .
LEF-1 protein was bound by immobilized GST-ALY but not GST alone ( Fig .
3A , lane 2 ) .
Because ALY contains regions with some homology to RNA-binding domains , it was possible that the ALY : LEF-1 interaction was mediated indirectly by nucleic acids .
However , inclusion of ethidium bromide in the GST association experiments , which has been shown to disrupt potential nonspecific interactions caused by contaminating nucleic acids ( Lai and Herr 1992 ) , and preincubation of GST-ALY and the °*S-la-beled proteins with RNase did not affect the association of GST-ALY with LEF-1 ( data not shown ) } .

We tested the ability of GST-ALY to interact with various *°S-labeled transcription factors including those that are known to bind the TCRa enhancer ( Fig .

Strikingly , in addition to LEF-1 { lane 2 ) , GST-ALY interacted specifically with AML-3 { lane 3 ) and AML-1 { see below ] ) .
In contrast , GST-ALY did not detectably associate with CBFB [ lane 4 ) , the heterodimeric binding partner of AML proteins ( Ogawa et al .

Members of the ATF/CREB family including ATF-2 , CREB-B , and c-/un , also failed to interact strongly with GST-ALY , although a very low level of binding of CREB-B and c-Jun was observed { lane 6 ; data not shown ) .

These results were confirmed by reciprocal associations that demonstrated that °°S-labeled ALY could bind to immobilized GST-LEF-1 and GST-AML-3 , but not significantly to GST-CBFB , GST-Ets-1 , or GST-ATF2 ( data not shown .

binding to GST-ALYANC but reduced binding to GST-ALY .
Thus , the amino- or carboxy-terminal regions of ALY may mediate interactions with the HMG domain and the central region of ALY may associate with the CAD of LEF-1 .
Previous studies delineated the DNA-binding domain of AML-1 and AML-3 , termed the Runt domain , to the amino-terminal half of the proteins .
The carboxy-terminal half of AML proteins is required for its ability to function as a transcription activator both at the TCRB enhancer ( Bae et al .
1994 ) and the TCRa enhancer ( L. Bruhn , unpubl . } .
Similar to LEF-1 , AML proteins activate transcription in the context of other factor-binding sites but not from multimerized sites ( Y. Ito , pers .
comm . ) .
As expected from the high degree of homology between the AML proteins , GST-ALY bound with similar efficiency to AML-3 ( Fig .
3A ) and AML-1 ( Fig .
5 ) .
Truncation of residues carboxy-terminal to 287 of AML-1 decreased the 644 GENES & DEVELOPMENT association with GST-ALYANC by a factor of 20 .
Deletion of all residues downstream of the Runt domain completely abrogated the interaction of full-length GST-ALY with AML-1 .
Analysis of the interaction of GST-ALY and GST-ALYANC with the corresponding deletion derivatives of AML-3 yielded similar results { data not shown ) .
Thus , ALY interacts with two regions within the carboxy-terminal half of AML-1 that contains a CAD , but not with the Runt domain that has been shown to interact with CBFB ( Ogawa et al .

Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Incubation of recombinant purified LEF-1 with high concentrations of purified GST-ALY yielded a complex that migrated with a slower mobility than that formed with LEF-1 alone , consistent with the formation of a ternary DNA complex [ Fig .

No slower migrating complex was detected when GST-ALY was coincubated with the HMG domain ( Fig .

In addition , GST-ALY had no detectable DNA-binding activity by itself in this assay ( Fig .

Nota-bly , ALY increased DNA binding approximately fivefold by full-length LEF-1 and the HMG domain , both of which interact with ALY .

To examine whether ALY has an effect on DNA binding by AML proteins , we incubated the 98-bp TCRa « enhancer probe with purified recombinant AML-3 , which could be obtained from bacteria in soluble form .
A complex that migrated with a slower mobility than the AML-3 : DNA complex was detected ( Fig .
6C ) .
In the ALY : AML-3 : DNA ternary complex , DNA binding was increased ~20-fold .
In contrast , coincubation of ALY with the Runt domain of AML-3 increased DNA binding less than twofold and did not result in formation of a detectable ternary complex ( Fig .
6C ) .
The Runt domain binds DNA more efficiently than full-length AML-3 protein but does not interact with ALY in the GST association assay .
Therefore , the association of AML proteins with ALY may antagonize the function of an inhibitory domain , consistent with the previous observations that carboxy-terminally truncated versions of AML-1 bind DNA with higher affinity than full-length protein ( Bae et al .
1994 ; Tanaka et al .
1995 ) .
ALY specifically stimulates the activity of the TCRa enhancer Previously we have found that expression of LEF-1 and the lymphoid-specific factors AML { CBFa , PEBP2 « ) and Ets-1 confers high levels of TCRa enhancer activity in nonlymphoid HeLa cells { Giese et al .
1995 ) .
Given the lower ALY mRNA levels in HeLa cells compared to most T-cell lines { see Fig .
2B ) , we used the reconstituted Hela cell system to determine the effect of ALY overexpression on TCRa enhancer activity .
For these and other transfection experiments , we used AML-1 , which is expressed in T cells much more abundantly than AML-3 { Satake et al .
1995 ) .
Overexpression of ALY resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of TCRa « -CAT ex Figure 7 .
- ALY stimulates specifically the A activity of the TCRe enhancer .
( A ) Full length ALY stimulates TCRe enhancer ac- 300 r -- tivity reconstituted in nonlymphoid cells .
HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids for AML-1 [ 200 ng ) , Ets-1 { 200 ng ) , and LEF-1 ( 100 ng ) alone or with different amounts of expression plasmids for ALY or ALYANC together with 250 ng of a TCRa reporter plasmid .
The reporter plasmid ( top ) contains the minimal 98-bp 250 fold activation m o ] TCRa enhancer linked to the minimal fos 5° } promoter ( -56 to +109 } , and the chloram- 1 phenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .
For ALY ( n ; 0 500 these and subsequent transfection assays , _ ALYANC ( ng ) luciferase or CAT activity was normalized LEF-1 to the activity of an RSV-B-gal expression A351 Co C plasmid as an internal transfection stan HeLa cells pression with a maximum of fivefold ( Fig .
7A ) .
ALY alone or the truncated ALYANC in combination with the lymphoid-specific factors had no effect on TCRe enhancer activity .
To determine whether the ALY-mediated increase in reporter gene expression was specific for the TCRa enhancer , we tested three other reporter gene constructs controlled by the cytomegalovirus [ ( CMV ) , Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) , or SV40 viral enhancer/promoter regions , which are activated by endogenous proteins in Hela cells .
In addition , we examined the effect of ALY overexpression on the activity of two reporter genes stimulated by exogenously expressed API or Gal-4-VP16 .
In these experiments , we transfected minimal amounts of reporter and effector plasmids to ensure that potential ALY-mediated effects on reporter gene activity could be observed .
Except for a minor , twofold effect on the SV40-controlled reporter gene , the expression levels of all other reporters were unaffected by overexpression of ALY ( Fig .
7B ) .
ALY is required for TCRa enhancer function in T cells Although overexpression of ALY resulted in a significant increase in TCRa enhancer activity in HeLa cells , overexpression in T cell lines conferred negligible increases in TCRa « expression ( L. Bruhn , unpubl . ] .
This could reflect the higher levels of endogenous ALY transcript present in most T cell lines ( see Fig .
2B ) .
To determine the contribution of ALY to TCRa enhancer activity in T cells in which the enhancer is naturally functional , we attempted to decrease the levels of endogenous ALY protein using C-5 propyne pyrimidine-substituted phospho-rothicoate anti-sense oligonucleotides ( Wagner et al .
1993 ) .

Down-regulation of ALY expression in T cells abrogates TCRa enhancer function .
Jurkat T cells were transfected transiently with 1 ug of TCRa-CAT ( A ) , RSV-B-gal ( B ) , or CMV-T7-ALY ( C ) , together with increasing concentrations of ALY anti-sense or shuffled oligonucleotides .
The activities of the reporters in the presence of different concentrations of oligonucleotides were calculated relative to that with no oligo-nucleotide , which was designated as 100 % .
Whole cell extracts of cells transfected transiently with T7-ALY were analyzed by immunoblot using TZ monoclonal antibody .
Data in A and B are the average of at least two transfections carried out in duplicate ; error bars represent standard error of the mean .
tide with the TCRo-chloramphenicol acetylItransferase ( CAT ) reporter construct into Jurkat T cells decreased CAT expression in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
8A ) .
In contrast , similar concentrations of a shuffled control oligonucleotide had no effect on TCRa « -CAT expression ( Fig .
8A ) .
Importantly , a control reporter , RSV-B-gal , was unaffected by the ALY anti-sense oligonucleotide demonstrating that its effect is specific for the TCR enhancer ( Fig .
8B ) .
To examine whether transient transfection of ALY anti-sense oligonucleotides actually decreases the concentration of intracellular ALY protein , we cotransfected a plasmid expressing T7-epitope-tagged ALY into Jurkat T cells and examined the levels of T7 ALY , a LEF-1- and AML-l-interacting protein ALY in whole cell extracts by immunoblot analysis .
Strikingly , the expression of T7-ALY was decreased in a dose-dependent manner with the ALY anti-sense oligonucleotide but was unaffected by similar concentrations of the shuffled control oligonucleotide ( Fig .
8C ) .
Thus , ALY plays an important role in the regulation of the TCRa « enhancer .
Transcriptional activation by ALY is dependent on multiple TCRa enhancer-binding proteins One simple model of ALY function is that this protein increases the activity of the TCRa enhancer by providing the enhancer complex with a transcription activation domain through binding to LEF-1 .
To explore this possibil-ity , we tested whether ALY is capable of activating transcription when tethered to DNA by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain .
ALY-Gal4 did not confer activation from multimerized Gald4 sites in transfected T cells and like-wise , a LexA-ALY fusion protein did not activate expression of a reporter containing multimerized LexA sites [ Fig .
9A ; data not shown ) } .
In addition , neither ALY-Gal4 nor LexA-ALY fusion proteins significantly activated expression of TCRa enhancer constructs in which the LEF-1 binding site was replaced with a Gal4 or LexA site ( Fig .
9B ; data not shown ) .
Efficient expression and DNA binding of the fusion proteins was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays with nuclear extracts from COS7 cells transfected with these expression plasmids ( Fig .
9C ) .
These data suggest that ALY lacks a typical activation domain and probably does not stimulate TCRa « enhancer function by recruitment of a transcription activation domain to the enhancer complex .
The findings that ALY can form multimers and can interact with both LEF-1 and AML proteins raised the possibility that it may serve to functionally bridge these factors within the TCRa « enhancer complex .
According to this view , the function of ALY in the reconstituted HeLa system would be dependent on both LEF-1 and AML-1 .
Coexpression of ALY with any two of the three lymphoid-specific factors stimulated the activity of TCRa four- to fivefold , although the levels of reporter expression were ~10-fold lower than those observed with all three factors ( cf , Figs .
7A and 9D ) .
In contrast , no significant ALY stimulation was observed with individual lymphoid-specific factors , with the exception of a twofold ALY stimulation with Ets-1 .
On basis of the presence of AML-2 ( CBFa3 , PEBP2 « C ) in all cell types , this modest increase of TCRa-CAT expression could be attributable to a stimulation by ALY in concert with this endogenous isoform .
Consistent with this interpreta-tion , the increase was not observed with a TCRa « enhancer in which both AML-binding sites were mutated ( Fig .
2D , TCRamA ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that the stimulation of TCRa enhancer activity by ALY is dependent on the presence of any two of the three lymphoid-specific factors LEF-1 , AML-1 , and Ets-1 , presumably in combination with a member of the ubiquitously expressed CREB/ATF family .

HeLa cells were transfected transiently with different combinations of expression plasmids for AML { 200 ng } , Ets-1 ( 200 ng ) , and LEF-1 ( 100 ng ) alone or together with 500 ng of ALY expression plasmid .
TCRa « -CAT or TCRamA-CAT ( 250 ng } , which contains mutations in both AML-binding sites , were used as reporters .
The numbers above the bars are the average fold difference between transfections with or without ALY expression plasmids .
stimulation appears to be independent of a simultaneous interaction of ALY with LEF-1 and AML-1 .
Discussion In this report , we present the identification and characterization of a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein , termed ALY , that interacts specifically with two TCRa enhancer-binding factors , LEF-1 and AML-1 .
We find that overexpression of ALY in a reconstituted HeLa cell system stimulates the activity of the TCRa enhancer and that down-regulation of ALY using anti-sense oligonucleotides virtually abrogates TCRa enhancer activity in T cells .
Thus , ALY seems to play a critical role in the function of the TCRa « enhancer .
Intriguingly , ALY interacts with domains of LEF-1 and AML-1 that mediate transcriptional activation within a specific context of other DNA-bound factors .
However , ALY does not seem to contain an activation domain capable of stimulating transcription when tethered to multimerized DNA sites through fusion to a Gald4 or LexA DNA-binding domain .
This finding distinguishes ALY from typical coactivators that contain transcriptional activation domains .
For example , CBP is a coactivator that interacts with both various transcription factors and TFIIB , a component of the basal transcription machinery ( for review , see Janknecht and Hunter 1996 ) .
Another characteristic of ALY is its ability to stimulate DNA binding of transcription factors including LEF-1 and AML .
We propose that ALY is a novel type of transcriptional regulator that may function 648 GENES & DEVELOPMENT to coordinate the activity of CADs within multiprotein enhancer complexes or to regulate the DNA-binding properties of proteins within the TCRa « enhancer complex .
ALY acts in the context of multiple TCRa enhancer-binding proteins The finding that ALY associates with both LEF-1 and AML proteins may account for the marked dependence of the TCRa enhancer on ALY .
Down-regulation of ALY in T cells by anti-sense oligonucleotides decreases the activity of the enhancer by at least 100-fold .
In contrast , mutations of individual factor-binding sites in the enhancer reduces its activity 5- to 10-fold [ Giese et al .
1995 ) .
Thus , ALY may be important for the function of both LEF-1 and AML-1 , and possibly other factors that participate in regulating the activity of the multiprotein TCRa « enhancer complex .
The context dependence of ALY function is reminiscent of the requirement of LEF-1 and AML-1 to act in a specific context of proteins .
Part of the context dependence of LEF-1 can be attributed to the bending of DNA by the HMG domain of LEF-1 ( Giese et al .
1992 , 1995 ] , but the activation domain of LEF-1 tethered to a heterologous DNA-binding domain also shows a context dependence ( Carlsson et al , 1993 ; Giese and Grosschedl 1993 ) .
Part of the context-dependent function of AML-1 protein may reflect its direct interaction with Ets-1 , which binds an adjacent site in the TCRa and TCRB enhancers ( Wotton et al .
1994 ; Giese et al .
1995 ; Sun et al .
1995 ) .
The ternary AML : Ets-1 : DNA complex Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press is , however , rather unstable and is , by itself , not competent to stimulate transcription from a minimal promoter ( Giese et al .
1995 ) .
Therefore , additional interactions may be involved in mediating the context dependence of LEF-1 and AML proteins .
Although the interactions of ALY with both LEF-1 and AML-1 could , in principle , contribute to the context dependence by bridging these DNA-binding proteins , ALY also stimulates the activity of the TCRa « enhancer in the absence of either LEF-1 or AML-1 .
Moreover , we failed to detect a further stabilization of the ALY : LEF-1 : DNA ternary complex in vitro in the presence of AML or vice versa { data not shown ) .
Thus , ALY may mediate transcriptional stimulation by facilitating the interaction of the CADs of LEF-1 and AML-1 with other components of the TCRa enhancer complex .
In addition to the association with LEF-1 and AML-1 , ALY shows some ability to interact weakly with members of the ATF/CREB family in vitro , raising the possibility that ALY may function to couple LEF-1 or AML-1 , or both , to factors bound at the ATF/CREB site .
Interestingly , the formation of the ternary complex of ALY with LEF-1 or AML proteins and DNA is dependent on the 98-bp TCRa « enhancer fragment and is not observed with a 50-bp fragment that lacks sequences upstream of the LEF-1 binding site .
These observations raise the possibility that ALY may also interact weakly with upstream sequences , although we did not detect a clear footprint in DNase I protection assays .
Thus , ALY may participate in the multiple protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involved in the TCRa enhancer complex , which , together , account for the context dependence of individual protein compo-nents .
LEF- { -interacting proteins contribute to distinct transcriptional regulatory functions Consistent with the context-dependent function of ALY , interaction of this protein with LEF-1 does not mediate activation of transcription from multimerized LEF-1 binding sites ( S.-C. Hsu and R. Grosschedl , unpubl . ) .
However , another LEF-l-interacting protein , B-catenin , which has been shown recently to associate with the amino-terminal 76 residues of LEF-1 ( Behrens et al .
1996 ; Huber et al .
1996 ) , confers on LEF-1 and the related HMCG-domain protein XTCPF-3 the ability to stimulate transcription from multimerized sites , although catenin does not augment LEF-1 function at the TCRa enhancer [ Behrens et al .
1996 ; Molenaar et al .
1996 ; S.-C. Hsu and R. Grosschedl , unpubl . ) .
Thus , interactions of LEF-1 with distinct proteins mediate either context-dependent or context-independent regulatory functions .
B-Catenin is involved in both cell adhesion and the wnt signal transduction pathway , suggesting that LEF-l may function as a nuclear target of this developmentally important signaling pathway .
Consistent with this putative function of LEF-1 , targeted inactivation of the Lefi gene in the mouse resulted in severe developmental defects in the formation of tissues that express this gene during embryogenesis , including teeth , mammary glands , and hair follicles ( van Genderen et al .
1994 ) .
Al ALY , a LEF-1- and AML-1-interacting protein though targeted mutation of the Lefi gene did not abrogate the expression of the TCRa « gene ( van Genderen et al .
1994 ) , recent analysis of mice carrying a mutation in both the Lef1 gene and the closely related Tof1 gene revealed a complete block in T-cell differentiation and a lack of TCRa gene expression ( R. Okamura , H. Clevers , and R. Grossched1 , unpubl . ) .
Thus , LEF-1 and TCF-1 may play redundant roles in regulating TCRa gene expression in vivo .
TCF-1 is significantly more abundant than LEF-1 in thymocytes ( Travis et al .
1991 ; van de Wetering et al .
1991 ) .
However , TCFE-1 is 10-fold less efficient than LEF-1 in stimulating TCRa enhancer activity in transfected tissue culture cells { van de Wetering et al .
1996 ; L. Bruhn , unpubl . ) .
Interestingly , TCF-1 , which contains an HMG domain virtually identical to that of LEF-1 , is divergent in the ALY-interacting region and ALY associates only weakly with TCF-1 { ( L. Bruhn , unpubl . ) .
Thus , the ability of DNA-bound LEF-1 to interact stably with ALY may , at least in part , explain the higher efficiency of LEF-1 in stimulating TCRa « enhancer function relative to TCF-1 .
The ALY-interaction domain of AML-1 is translocated in many leukemias Studies of AML function have demonstrated that this protein plays an important role in transcriptional regulation of many targets in addition to TCRa .
The block in fetal liver hematopoesis displayed by mice carrying a targeted mutation in the AML-1 gene demonstrates that AML-1 plays a role in regulating genes required for definitive hematopoiesis of all lineages ( Okuda et al .
1996 ; Wang et al .
1996 ) .
The abundant expression of ALY observed in the fetal liver ( L. Bruhn , unpubl . )
is consistent with a possible role for ALY in mediating AML function at these putative targets .
At least 25 % of all childhood leukemias involve translocations in the genes encoding AML-1 or its heterodimeric DNA-binding partner CBFGB { for review , see Ito 1996 ) .
Interestingly , these translocations often replace the carboxy-terminal transcription activation domain of AML-1 , which interacts with ALY , with segments of other proteins producing dominant-negative fusion proteins that can bind DNA strongly but do not activate transcription normally .
To date , ALY is the only reported protein that interacts with the carboxyl terminus of AML-1 , whereas all other known AML-interacting proteins , including CBFRB , Ets-1 , and C/EBP , associate with the Runt domain .
In addition to its role at the TCRa enhancer , ALY may facilitate the function of AML-1 in combination with other proteins such as Myb and C/EBP , which have been shown to stimulate transcription in a synergistic manner with AML proteins at the TCR8 enhancer and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter , respectively ( Hernandez-Munain and Krangel 1995 ; Zhang et al .
1996 ) .
Potential functions of ALY in regulating the TCRa enhancer The ability of ALY to bind weakly to RNA raises the GENES & DEVELOPMENT 649 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Bruhn et al .
possibility that , by analogy with HIV Tat protein [ for review , see Jones and Peterlin 1994 ) , ALY may stimulate gene expression by interacting with the nascent tran-script .
However , stimulation of the activity of the TCRa enhancer by ALY is observed with either the tk or fos promoters linked to the bacterial CAT reporter gene ( Fig .
7A ; data not shown ) .
Thus , ALY-mediated stimulation of the TCRa enhancer does not appear to require specific promoter or coding sequences .
The association of ALY with the CADs of LEF-1 and AML-1 can also occur with DNA-bound proteins , although the protein-protein interactions appear to be weak because high concentrations of ALY are required .
One notable feature of the interaction of ALY with LEF-1 and AML is the 5- to 20-fold increase in DNA binding by both proteins .
This effect of ALY on DNA binding involves the amino- and/or carboxy-terminal regions of ALY because ALYANC does not increase DNA binding by LEF-1 or AML proteins .
The stimulation of DNA binding by full-length ALY may be related to its potential to interact nonspecifically with nucleic acids .
Consistent with this view , DNA binding by other proteins , such as c-Jun and glucocorticoid receptor that do not significantly interact with ALY , can also be augmented by addition of high concentrations of ALY in vitro ( data not shown ) .
However , the stimulation of transcription by ALY appears to require specific interaction domains because ALY does not stimulate the function of c-Jun or glucocorticoid receptor in transfection assays ( Fig .
7B ; data not shown ) .
Several proteins have been found to increase DNA binding by other factors .
For example , HMGI ( Y } , a small basic DNA-binding protein , stably interacts with both ATFE-2 and nuclear factor- « xB ( NF- « B ) on the B-interferon enhancer and increases DNA binding of these proteins and their assembly into a stereospecific multiprotein complex ( Thanos and Maniatis 1992 , 1995 ) .
The unrelated proteins HMG-1 and HMG-2 have also been shown to augment DNA binding of various proteins without participating in formation of a stable ternary complex ( Onate et al .
1994 ; Zwilling et al .
1995 ) .
In addition , the protein hnRNP-K , which contains a KH motif RNA-binding domain and interacts with single-stranded nucleic acids , has been shown to interact with TATA-binding protein { TBP } in vitro and to function as a transcription factor in vivo ( Michelotti et al .
1996 ) .
Finally , dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 ( DCoH ) , a transcriptional coactivator containing a potential RNP RNA-binding motif augments the dimerization and DNA binding by hepatocyte nuclear factor-l1 ( Mendel et al .
1991 ; Endrizzi et al .
1995 ) .
Taken together , these proteins appear to increase DNA binding by facilitating structural changes in DNA or proteins that accompany binding of individual proteins or the assembly of multiprotein complexes .
By analogy with these proteins , a simple model for ALY function at the TCRa enhancer could involve the increase of DNA binding by both LEF-1 and AML proteins .
According to this view , the RNP motif of ALY , which mediates association with the CADs of LEF-1 and 650 GENES & DEVELOPMENT AML-1 , would recruit ALY into the enhancer complex to allow the basic RGG motifs of ALY to facilitate the structural distortion of DNA that accompanies binding by both LEF-1 and AML-1 ( Giese et al .
1992 ; Love et al .
1995 ; Golling et al .
1996 ) .
However , this model of ALY function can not account for all observations .
First , ALY stimulates the activity of the TCRa enhancer in vivo by fivefold in the presence of both LEF-1 and AML-1 and a similar increase is observed when only one of these factors is present ( Fig .
9D ) .
Second , compared to the ALY-mediated stimulation of DNA binding by either LEF-1 or AML proteins individually , ALY does not appear to further augment binding of both factors together in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays ( data not shown ) .
In addition , preliminary experiments suggest that addition of purified ALY protein to a mixture of LEF-1 , AML-3 , Ets-1 , and ATF-2 or CREB is not sufficient to promote stable complex formation in DNase I footprint assays { A. Munnerlyn , unpubl . ) .
Previously , we have shown that stable formation of the ternary AML : Ets-1 : DNA complex is dependent on LEF-1 and HeLa cell nuclear extract , which may have provided the correct ATF/CREB family member or other factors required for stable complex formation ( Giese et al .
1995 ) .
Another possible , not mutually exclusive , model is that the association of ALY with the CADs of LEF-1 and AML-1 facilitates the coordination of multiple activation domains in the multiprotein TCRa « enhancer complex .
This stimulation could be mediated by direct interactions of a composite activation surface with basal factors or by recruitment of as yet unidentifed coactiva-tors .
Thus , ALY interaction with multiple TCRa « enhancer-bound factors may be involved in the functional synergy observed between these factors .
For both models ALY may be incorporated stably into the TCRa enhancer complex , possibly by operating as a molecular glue .
Al-ternatively , ALY may act in a transient manner to facilitate interactions between multiple proteins or the DNA and may not be a structural part of the transcriptionally active multiprotein complex .
Whatever molecular mechanism accounts for the function of ALY in regulating the TCRa enhancer , the association of ALY with the CADs of LEF-1 and AML-1 , along with its observed functional properties , suggest that ALY may function to integrate and coordinate multiple protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions within specific higher order nucleoprotein complexes .

3 ) was expressed from pET-PEBP2aA1l ( 94-513 ) [ ( K. Giese and R .
Grossched ! , unpubl . ) .
To construct pLEF-1-6His , a PCR-generated LEP-1 fragment was inserted into pET23d ( Novagen ) in-frame with a hexa-histidine tag .
pGST-ALYANC was constructed by inserting a Small-EcoRI fragment that encodes 13 polylinker-derived residues followed by codons 76-177 of ALY into pGEX3x ( Pharmacia } .
pGST-ALY was generated by inserting a Ncol-Sacl fragment from p138-20z into pGEX-KG ( Guan and Dixon 1991 ) .
The AML-3 ( 94-411 } protein used in Figure 6 was expressed from pET-PEBP2 « aA1 ( 94-411 } ( K.Giese and R. Grosschedl , unpubl . } .
C-5 propyne pyrimidine-substituted phosphorothioate oligonucleotides used for the anti-sense experiments are as follows : The anti-sense ALY oligonucleotide { 5 -GACATGTCCATTTT-GTCGGC ) is complementary to codons 2-8 of the ALY tran-script .
The shuffled control oligonucleotide [ 5'-TCATGCGGT-TGCATACGTCT ) has the same base composition in a random order generated by the GCG sequence analysis program Shuffle .
Yeast two-hybrid screen , cDNA isolation , and RNA analysis The LEF-1-LexA fusion construct ( Giese and Grosschedl 1993 ) was subcloned into pBTM116 ( Hollenberg et al .
1995 ) and the resulting plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain L40 , which contains integrated JexA-lacZ and lexA-HIS3 reporter genes ( Hollenberg et al .
1995 ) .
The mouse E10 { embryonic day 9.5-10.5 ) cDNA-VP16 fusion library , which contains inserts averaging 300 bp in length , was screened using methods described in Hollenberg et al .
[ 1995 ] .
From 2.7 x 10° original transformants , 200 HIS*/LacZ* clones were isolated .
Of these , 75 maintained expression of the reporter genes only in the presence of LEF-l-LexA .
Library plasmids isolated from these clones were retransformed into strain L40 containing expression plasmids for LexA , LEF-l-LexA , LexA-lamin ( Hollenberg et al .
1995 ) , LexA-STE3 , or LexA-FUS1 ( kind gifts of S. Givens , B. Ferguson , and G. Sprague , University of Oregon , Eugene ) , to isolate eight cDNAs that encode peptides that interact specifically with LEF-1 .
The 310-bp two-hybrid cDNA clone encoding ALYANC was radiolabeled by random priming and used to screen a murine thymocyte cDNA library , a kind gift of M. Davis { Stanford Uni-versity , CA ) .
The sequence of a 1.1-kb cDNA clone 138-202 and the predicted amino acid sequence were compared with the GenBank DNA and protein databases using the blast algorithm { Altshul et al .
1990 ) .
Immunofluorescence and immunoblots COST cells were transfected transiently by electroporation with pCMV-T7-ALY and were allowed to settle onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides and incubated for 48 hr .
Slides were processed as described in Travis et al .
( 1991 ) .
For immunodetection , T7 monoclonal antibody ( Novagen ) was used at a 1:1000 dilution , ALY , a LEF-1- and AML-1-interacting protein followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody .
4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ; 0.1 pg/ml ) was used to stain nuclei .
Whole-cell extracts of Jurkat T cells transfected transiently with CMV-T7-ALY and antisense oligonucleotides were prepared by boiling and sonicating the cells in SDS-PAGE sample buffer .
Extract from 2 x 10° cells was separated on 12.5 % SDS polyacrylamide gels , transferred to nitrocellulose membrane , probed with T7 monoclonal antibody ( Novagen ) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody ( Cappel ) , and developed with Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent ( DuPont NEN } .
Cell culture , transient transfections , and reporter gene assays COS7 and Hela cells were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum { FCS } .
Lymphoid cells were grown in RPMI medium , supplemented with 10 % FCS and 50 um 2-mercaptoethanol .
Transient transfections for the experiments shown in Figures 7 and 9 were performed by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine procedure with the amounts of plasmids indicated in the figure legends and 250 ng of RSV-B-galactosidase control plasmid ( Grosschedl and Baltimore 1985 ) .
Transfections of COST cells for the experiment of Figure 9C were performed by electroporation with 20 ug of CMV expression plasmids .
Anti-sense oligonucleotides were transfected with Lipofectin according to manufacturer 's instructions ( GIBCO-BRL } .
CAT , luciferase , and B-galactosidase assays were performed as described in Starr et al .
( 1996 ) .
After background subtraction , CAT or luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of the B-galactosidase internal transfection control .
In vitro protein-protein association assays 35§-Labeled proteins were synthesized using a coupled tran-scription/translation ( TaT ) kit ( Promega ) .
GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with radiolabeled proteins in binding buffer [ 10 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 8 ) , 150 mm NaCl , 0.2 % NP-40 , 1 mm DTT , 0.2 % BSA ] for 2 hr at 4°C .
Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer followed by one wash with 1 ml of binding buffer lacking BSA .
Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer [ 62.5 mm Tris-HCI { pH 6.8 ) , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 5 % B-mercaptoethanoll , separated by SDS-PAGE , and visualized by autoradiography .
Where indicated , the GST and *°S-labeled proteins were preincubated with 50 ug/ml pancreatic RNase ( Boehringer Mannheim } for 15 min at 22°C before the association reactions .
This amount of RNase was sufficient to eliminate the ribosomal RNA present in the in vitro translated *°S-labeled proteins as detected by ethidium bromide staining .
Protein purification , nuclear extracts , and DNA-binding analysis GST fusion proteins and the LEF-1-HMG domain polypeptide were overexpressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-conjugated agarose beads essentially as described in Giese et al .
( 1995 ) .
The 6-His-tagged proteins LEF-1 , AML { 94-411 } , and Runt were expressed in bacteria and purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads ( Qiagen ) according to manufacturer 's instruc-tions .
Nuclear extracts of COST cells were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al .
( 1989 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and DNase I footprint-ing were performed as described by Travis et al .
( 1991 ) .
DNA-binding reactions contained 20 mm HEPES buffer ( pH 7.9 ) , 75 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 651 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Bruhn et al .
