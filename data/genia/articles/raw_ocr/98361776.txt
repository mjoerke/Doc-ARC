Transcription Factor B-Cell-Specific Activator Protein ( BSAP ) Is Differentially Expressed in B Cells and in Subsets of B-Cell Lymphomas By Laszlo Krenacs , Andreas W. Himmelmann , Leticia Quintanilla-Martinez , Thierry Fest , Agostino Riva , Axel Wellmann , Eniko Bagdi , John H. Kehrl , Elaine S. Jaffe , and Mark Raffeld The paired box containing gene PAX-5 encodes the transcription factor BSAP ( B-cell-specific activator protein ) , which plays a key role in B-lymphocyte development .
Despite its known involvement in a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , a detailed examination of BSAP expression in NHL has not been previously reported .
In this study , we analyzed normal and malignant lymphoid tissues and cell lines , including 102 cases of B-cell NHL , 23 cases of T- and null-cell NHL , and 18 cases of Hodgkin 's disease .
Normal lymphoid tissues showed strong nuclear BSAP expression in mantle zone B cells , less intense reactivity in follicular center B cells , and no expression in cells of the T-cell-rich zones .
Monocytoid B cells showed weak expression , whereas plasma cells and extrafollicular large transformed B cells were negative .
Of the 102 B-cell NHLs , 83 ( 81 % ) demonstrated BSAP expression .
All of the 13 ( 100 % ) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( B-CLLs ) , 21 of ( 100 % ) mantle cells ( MCLs ) , and 20 of 21 ( 95 % ) follicular lymphomas ( FLs ) were positive .
Moderate staining intensities were found in most B-CLL and FL cases , whereas most MCLs showed strong B-CELL—SPECIFIC activator protein ( BSAP ) is a 52-kD transcription factor originally identified as a mammalian homologue of the sea urchin tissue-specific activator protein ( TSAP ) . !
BSAP is encoded by the Pax-5 gene , a member of the highly conserved paired box ( Pax ) gene family of transcription factors , '' and is equivalent to the NF-HB , '' Sa-BP , A NFSp-B1 , '' LR1 , ° and EBB-1 '' B-cell specific nuclear factors identified by different investigators . ''
Among hematopoietic cells , Pax-5 gene expression is restricted to the B-cell lineage . ''
Pax-5 gene transcription is initiated in pro-B cells and is abundant at the pre-B- and mature B-cell differentiation stages , but absent in terminally differentiated plasma cells .
Pax-5 gene expression also occurs in the mesencephalon and spinal cord during embryogenesis and in the adult testis . ''
BSAP has been implicated in the regulation of several B-cell-specific genes , in controlling B-cell development , and in From the Hematopathology Section , Laboratory of Pathology , National Cancer Institute and the B cell Molecular Immunology Section , Laboratory of Immunoregulation , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ; and the Department of Pathology , Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Medical University , Szeged , Hungary .

Eight of 12 ( 67 % ) marginal zone lymphoma cases showed negative or low BSAP levels , and 17 of 24 ( 71 % ) large B-cell lymphomas displayed moderate to strong expression .
None of the 23 T- and null-cell lymphomas reacted with the BSAP antisera , whereas in Hodgkin 's dis-ease , 2 of 4 ( 50 % ) nodular lymphocytic predominance and 5 of 14 ( 36 % ) classical cases showed weak nuclear or nucleolar BSAP reactions in a fraction of the tumor cells .
Western blot analysis show ed a 52-kD BSAP band in B-cell lines , but not in non-B-cell or plasma cell lines .
We conclude that BSAP expression is largely restricted to lymphomas of B-cell lineage and that BSAP expression varies in B-cell subsets and subtypes of B-cell NHL .
The high levels of BSAP , especially those found in large-cell |ymphomas and in some follicular lymphomas , may be a consequence of deregulated gene expression and suggest a possible involvement of PAX-5 in certain B-cell malignancies .

BSAP EXPRESSION IN LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES to tumorigenesis in these cancers .
`` `` > '' Deregulated PAX-5 gene expression has been observed in human medulloblastomas® and in adult astrocytic neoplasms . ''
In the latter tumors , PAX-5 expression levels correlated with the degree of malignancy . ''
In addition , BSAP ( PAX-5 ) , PAX-2 , and PAX-8 proteins are capable of inhibiting the function of p53 in vitro , suggesting another mechanism by which these genes may contribute to the development of neoplasia . '' ''
Most recently , the PAX-5 gene has been implicated in a rare subset of lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation through translocation with the Ig heavy chain gene locus . ''
The above-mentioned data and the proposed key role of BSAP in B-cell differentiation and proliferation suggest that dysregulation of PAX-5 gene function may contribute to tumorigenesis in lymphoid malignancies .
We report here results from an immunohistochemical study of BSAP expression in reactive lymphoid tissues and neoplastic lymphoid tumors , using a specific polyclonal antisera to the human protein .
Immunoblot analysis of hematolymphoid cell lines , including those representing all stages of B-cell matura-tion , was also performed .
We found that BSAP expression is restricted to B cells in reactive tissues and non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas ( NHL s ) of B-cell lineage .
Furthermore , the data are consistent with a role for BSAP in the pathogenesis of some forms of human NHLs .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue samples .
Routinely fixed and processed malignant lymphoma and reactive lymphoid tissue samples were selected from the histopathology files of the Hematopathology Section , Laboratory of Pathology , National Cancer Institute , National Institutes of Health ( Bethesda , MD ) and the Department of Pathology , Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Medical University ( Szeged , Hungary ) .
All cases included in the study were classified according to the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms ( REAL ) . ''
All cases had been previously immunophenotyped in either paraffin or frozen section immunohistochemistry .
Polyclonal CD3 ( DAKO Corp , Carpinteria , CA ) , CD15/LeuM1 ( Becton Dickinson [ BD ] , Mountain View , CA ) , CD20/L26 ( DAKO ) , CD30/BerH2 ( DAKO ) , CD43/Leu22 ( BD ) , CD45RO/A6 ( Zymed , South San Francisco , CA ) , €CD56/123C3 ( Mono-san/Caltag Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) , CD68/KP1 ( DAKO ) , and CD792/JCB117 ( DAKO ) were used in paraffin sections , whereas CD2/LeuSb ( BD ) , CD3/Leud ( BD ) , CD4/Leu3a ( BD ) , CD5/Leu1 ( BD ) , CD7/Leu9 ( BD ) , CD8/Leu2a ( BD ) , CD11b/Leu15 ( BD ) , CD19/Leu12 ( BD ) , CD22/Leu14 ( BD ) , and CD56/Leu19 ( BD ) were used for frozen sections .
BSAP antibodies .
- Polyclonal antibodies reactive with human BSAP were generated by immunizing rabbits either with an N-terminal ( MDLEKNYPTPRTSRC ; antibody 7077 ) or a C-terminal peptide ( CPPAAATAYDRH ; antibody 7083 ) coupled to Keyhole limpet hemo-cyanin ( KLH ) .
These antibodies have previously been shown to be specific for BSAP protein by the following criteria .
( 1 ) In electromobil-ity shift assay , both antibodies supershifted a complex formed with a B-cell nuclear extract prepared from HS-Sultan cells and a DNA probe containing a high-affinity BSAP binding site .
( 2 ) Both antisera reacted with a major product of the appropriate molecular weight ( 52 kD ) by Western blot analysis .
( 3 ) Both antisera react with B cells and not T cells after immunohistochemical staining of lymphoid tissue ( A. Riva , manuscript in preparation ) .
Immunohistochemical detection of BSAP .
- For immunohistochemical detection of BSAP , antibody 7077 was used in all cases , whereas antibody 7083 was used for only a proportion of the samples .
All immunoreactions were performed after microwave antigen retrieval , 1309 according to a protocol modified from methods previously de-scribed . '' '' '' ''
Briefly , the antigen retrieval was performed for 40 minutes in a microwave pressure cooker ( Nordic Ware , Minneapolis , MN ) using either DAKO Target Retrieval Solution or 10 mmol/L citrate buffer ( pH 6.0 ) containing 0.1 % Tween-20 ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) .
The sections were incubated overnight with 7077 antiserum ( 1/1,000 ) at room temperature .
Immunoreactions were detected with biotinylated swine F ( ab ' ) ; antirabbit immunoglobulins ( DAKO ; 1/400 ) and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate ( DAKO ; 1/600 ) .
The peroxidase reaction was developed with 3,3 ' diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ( DAB ; Sigma ) .
All BSAP immunostains were compared with consecutively stained conventional hematoxylin and eosin sections as well as with sections stained with CD20 and CD3 to determine the tissue and immunolocal-ization of BSAP .
Double immunostaining was also performed on representative reactive lymph nodes and cases to more precisely evaluate coexpression of BSAP with B- ( CD20 ) and T- ( CD3 ) cell markers .
For these reactions , BSAP was detected as described above , except that the reaction was developed using a Peroxidase Vectastain Elite ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) and DAB ( Sigma ) to generate a brown precipitate .
In sequential reactions , either CD20 ( L26 ) or CD3 was detected after 1 hour of incubation with the primary antibody and 30 minutes of incubation with the secondary antibody .
These reactions were developed using the Elite ABC kit and DAB with nickle enhancement to generate a contrasting black precipitate or with VIP substrate ( Vector Laboratories ) to develop a contrasting dark purple precipitate .
Western analysis of BSAP .
- Human hematolymphoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal calf serum , 1 % ( wt/vol ) penicillin/streptomycin , and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine .
Exponentially growing cells ( about 10° cells/mL ) were subjected to protein extraction in modified RIPA lysis buffer ( 50 mmol/L Tris-HCI , pH 7.6 , 150 mmol/L NaCl , 0.5 % [ wt/vol ] Na-deoxycholate , 1 % [ vol/vol ] Nonidet P-40 , and 1 % [ wt/vol ] sodium dodecyl sulfate [ SDS ] ) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors ( 25 mg/mL leupeptin , 50 mg/mL aprotinin , and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ) .
The cells were lysed on ice , and the lysates were vortexed for 10 seconds in 10-minute intervals for a total time of 60 minutes .
The protein content of centrifuged lysates was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) , according to the manufacturer 's instruc-tions .
Identical amounts ( 75 mg of total extracted protein ) were boiled in Laemmili 's sample buffer and separated by electrophoresis on 10 % ( wt/vol ) SDS-polyacrylamide gels .
After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher & Schuell , Keene , NH ) , immunoblotting was performed as follows .
The membrane was blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in TTBS ( 50 mmol/L Tris-buffered saline , pH 7.6 , with 0.05 % Tween-20 ) containing 5 % nonfat dry milk , 10 % normal goat serum ( GIBCO Laboratories , Grand Island , NY ) , and 0.1 % NaN .
The nitrocellulose membranes were probed either with 7077 or 7083 immunosera ( both diluted in 1/1,000 ) and developed using biotinylated swine F ( ab ' ) ; antirabbit Igs ( 1/10,000 ; Dako ) , streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate ( 1/5,000 ; Dako ) , and ECL ( Amersham Life Science , Arlington Heights , IL ) detection reagents .
RESULTS Use of BSAP antisera for immunocytochemistry .
- To test the reactivity of the two BSAP antisera , 7083 and 7077 , in paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues , we examined the ability of the antisera to appropriately mark reactive lymphoid tissues .
Consistent with the known nuclear location of BSAP , a specific immunoreaction was observed only in nuclei within B-cell zones and in lymph node , tonsil , and spleen .
Furthermore , these initial studies established that mantle zone B cells From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

BSAP EXPRESSION IN LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES weaker but significant reaction intensity ; and weak expression , detectable nuclear staining above the background level .
Double-staining with antibodies directed against B- or T-cell-associated antigens clearly identified the BSAP-positive cells as B cells ( Fig 2A and B ) .
Identical results were obtained using either the amino-terminus-specific 7077 or the carboxy-terminus-spe-cific 7083 antiserum .
However , because of its clearer reaction pattern , antibody 7077 was systematically used in the study .
Two hundred twenty-eight cases were collected in the initial group .
Seventy-three of these cases showed poor or no BSAP immunoreaction , despite the presence of residual small normal B cells , and therefore were excluded from further evaluation .
These technically negative samples included either cases fixed in B5 or those for which only unstained paraffin slides stored at room temperature for years were available for study .
The loss of immunoreactivity over time in paraffin sections ( especially in B5-fixed tissues ) is well documented with some nuclear and nonnuclear antigens . '' ''
Among the 155 cases judged to be appropriate for evaluation of BSAP expression , there were 12 hyperplastic lymphatic tissues ( including nonspecific follicular hyperplasias of 3 tonsils and 7 lymph nodes , and 2 cases of Toxoplasma lymphadenitis ) , 102 B-cell lymphomas , 23 non-B-cell lymphomas including 12 peripheral T-cell lymphomas ( PTCLs ) , 3 precursor T-cell leuke-mia/lymphomas , 8 anaplastic large-cell lymphomas of T- and null-cell types ( ALCL ) , and 18 cases of Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) .
Reactive lymphoid tissues .
- In addition to the homogenous strong BSAP staining found in mantle zone cells , follicular center ( FC ) B cells displayed a variable but usually less intense , weak to moderate , BSAP reaction ( Fig 1A ) .
Weak to moderate nuclear staining was found in the dark zone centroblasts and in some light zone centrocytes , whereas weak reactions occurred in most light zone FC B cells , reflecting the characteristic polarization of reactive follicles .
The majority of normal monocytoid B cells characteristically seen in cases of toxoplasma lymphadenitis were negative , but rare cells demonstrated weak reactions .
No staining occurred in plasma cells , extrafollicular large B cells , histiocytes , and T cells .
B-cell NHL s. - Overall , 81 % ( 83/102 ) of the B-cell lymphomas demonstrated BSAP positivity ( Table 1 ) .
With rare excep-tions , all tumor cells in positive cases showed BSAP expression .
Weak expression of BSAP was found in tumor cells in 1 of the 2 precursor B-cell leukemia/lymphoma cases tested .
All 13 cases ( 100 % ) of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) expressed BSAP and most stained with moderate intensity .
Cells of proliferation centers usually displayed less intense , negative to weak , BSAP expression , although in 1 case , small cells were negative , whereas prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts showed moderate BSAP reac-tivity .
BSAP expression was demonstrated in 21 of 21 ( 100 % ) mantle cell lymphomas ( MCLs ) , with strong reactions occurring in the majority of cases ( Fig 1B ) .
Double-staining experiments demonstrated that BSAP was present exclusively in CD20+ tumor cells ( Fig 2C and D ) .
Only 1 of the 21 FLs ( 5 % ) was BSAP-negative .
Of the 20 positive cases , 2 ( both grade III cases [ 10 % ] ) showed weak BSAP expression , 11 ( 1 grade I , 8 grade II , and 2 grade III cases [ 55 % ] ) displayed moderate expression and 7 ( 1 grade I , 2 grade II , and 4 grade III cases [ 35 % ] ) were strongly BSAP-positive ( Fig 1C ) .
Loss of polariza- 1311 tion of neoplastic follicles was clearly seen with BSAP staining ( Fig 1C ) .
Double-staining studies showed that only the CD20+* B cells expressed BSAP , whereas the occasional intratumoral CD3 * cell and dendritic cell were negative for expression of the transcription factor ( Fig 2G ) .
Of the 12 marginal zone B-cell lymphomas tested , 5 ( 42 % ) were negative and 3 ( 25 % ) were weakly , 3 ( 25 % ) were moderately , and 1 ( 8 % ) was strongly BSAP-positive .
Four of the 5 monocytoid B-cell lymphomas of the parotid were either negative or weakly focally positive ( Fig 1E ) .
Nuclear staining was not demonstrated in 5 plasmacytomas tested , including 2 cases of myeloma and 3 extramedullary plasmacytomas .
Of the 2 lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma ( im-munocytoma ) cases , 1 showed a positive BSAP reaction .
Nineteen ( 79 % ) of 24 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas ( LBCL ) displayed BSAP expression of moderate to strong intensity , including 3 of 3 ( 100 % ) cases of mediastinal LBCL with strong positivity ( Fig 1D ) .
Again , double-staining studies indicated that only the CD20+* tumor cells contained detectable BSAP ( Fig 2E and F ) .
BSAP levels in T- and null-cell NHLs and HD .
BSAP immunoreactivity was not seen in 8 anaplastic large-cell lymphomas of T- and null-cell types , in 12 nonanaplastic peripheral T-cell lymphomas ( Figs 1E and 2H ) , or in the 3 cases of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma .
Of the 18 cases of HD , 7 ( 39 % ) showed weak nuclear or nucleolar positivity in a fraction of tumor cells , including 2 of 4 ( 50 % ) nodular lymphocytic predominance ( LP ) and 5 of 14 ( 36 % ) classical cases ( 4 nodular sclerosis and 1 lymphocyte-depleted subtype ) .
Western blot analysis for BSAP .
- Western blot analysis with the 7077 antibody demonstrated a specific protein band of the expected size ( 52 kD ) in cell lines corresponding to precursor and mature B cells , but not in terminally differentiated plasma cells , T cells , and other hematopoietic cell lines ( Table 2 and Fig 3 ) .
Identical results were obtained with the carboxy terminus-specific 7083 antibody in the cell lines tested .
In addition , the pre-B-cell line PB-697 also displayed an intense band of 46 kD ( Fig 3 ) that was only detected with the 7077 antisera .
The pre-B-cell line Nalm-6 had a similar 46-kD band , although at a much lower intensity .
However , gel shift analysis of PB-697 nuclear extracts did not show an additional BSAP gel shift ( data not shown ) , and immunoblotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the 46-kD protein resides in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus .
Furthermore , reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and sequencing of BSAP from PB697 cells failed to identify a novel mRNA transcript or evidence for a frame shift mutation ( A. Rivas , unpublished observation ) .
Thus , this band is unlikely to represent a c-terminally truncated form of BSAP , as recently described in the human pro-B-cell line REH .
DISCUSSION Using two polyclonal BSAP antisera , we evaluated the expression of BSAP in reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissues by immunocytochemistry and in representative B-cell and non-B-cell lines by immunoblotting .
We found that the majority of tissue B cells and greater than 80 % of the B-cell lymphomas reacted with the BSAP antisera .
Double-staining studies demonstrated that the vast majority of BSAP-positive cells coexpressed CD20 and that few , if any , expressed CD3 .
The levels of BSAP expression varied among different B-cell From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

subsets and among B-cell NHL subtypes .
In addition , 40 % of the HD cases tested had weak BSAP expression in occasional tumor cells .
In comparison , normal or neoplastic T cells and other hematolymphoid tissues consistently lacked BSAP .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study of in vivo BSAP expression in primary tumor samples of malignant lymphomas .
In reactive lymphoid tissues , BSAP expression was found only in the nucleus of B lymphocytes .
Interestingly , the different B-cell compartments displayed significant differences in the intensities of their BSAP immunoreactivity .
Cells of the follicular mantle contained the highest levels of BSAP , whereas germinal center B cells had considerably lower levels .
Extrafollicular transformed B cells ( immunoblasts ) , along with plasma cells , lacked detectable immunoreactivity .
The high BSAP levels found in mantle zone B cells relative to the germinal center B cells is curious because of the purported role of BSAP in B-cell proliferation and promoting Ig class switching .
** '' ' Because switch recombination apparently requires cell divi-sion '' '' and is believed to occur in the germinal center large cells ( centroblasts ) ,4 ' one might have expected high BSAP levels in these cells .
The importance of the decline of BSAP levels in the germinal center B cells remains to be determined .
Our observation that mantle zone B cells express high levels of BSAP suggests the presence of important BSAP target genes in these 1313 Table 2 .

Finally , the absence of BSAP in immunoblasts and plasma cells is consistent with its known downregulation in Ig-secreting cells . ''
The neoplastic B cells also displayed varying levels of BSAP that to some extent paralleled the levels found in the corresponding normal cells .
Strong BSAP expression was observed in mantle cell lymphomas .
This may reflect the derivation of this lymphoma from the strongly positive mantle zone B cells .
Whether the high level of BSAP in these tumors contributes to their unfavorable clinical course in comparison with other low grade lymphomas remains to be determined .
All cases of B-cell CLL/SLL expressed BSAP , but the staining was usually less intense than in the mantle cell lymphoma cases .
Weaker immunoreactivity of prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts than of small lymphoma cells was a characteristic finding .
In some cases , BSAP immunoreactivity even spared the proliferation centers .
Because prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts have a higher proliferative activity compared with the surrounding tumor cells , their lower BSAP levels contrasts with the positive correlation between BSAP levels and B-cell proliferation . ''
The lowered BSAP expression in these cells might be related to an abortive differentiation toward cells with increasing Ig heavy chain transcription . ''

In many cases , these levels approximated the high levels seen in normal mantle cells , in contrast to the low to moderate levels seen in their corresponding nonneoplastic counterpart , reactive follicle center B cells .
This observation suggests that BSAP may be expressed at inappropriately high levels in some FLs .
No correlation was found between the cytological grade of the FL , as proposed in the REAL Classification , and the intensity of BSAP positivity .
In contrast to follicular lymphoma , the majority of monocytoid B cells in toxoplasma lymphadenitis , as well as in tumor cells of marginal zone lymphomas ( composed of monocytoid cells ) , displayed no or low levels of BSAP expression .
Among lymphomas , this phenomenon was most apparent in primary monocytoid B-cell ( MALT-type ) lymphomas of the parotid gland .
Monocytoid and marginal zone B cells are considered to be memory B cells.4*~ '' ° This finding may indicate that modulation of BSAP expression may be involved in the generation of memory B cells .
BSAP/PAX-5 is thought to repress Ig heavy chain transcription in immature and mature B cells by inhibiting the activity of the Ig heavy chain 3 ' a chain enhancer in these cells. > '' * '' '' In plasma cells , downregulation of BSAP may remove this repressive activity on the Ig heavy chain 3 ' enhancer , facilitating high levels of Ig heavy chain transcription .
Because the BSAP antibodies failed to react in decalcified bone marrow core biopsies , we could study only a limited number of plasmacytoma/ myeloma cases .
We did not find nuclear BSAP expression in either normal or neoplastic plasma cells .
Consistent with our results , a recent study on PAX-5 mRNA expression in human multiple myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells also reported the failure to detect PAX-5 expression in these cells . ''
A substantial fraction ( 5/24 [ 21 % ] ) of the LBCL cases was negative for BSAP .
Most LBCLs are thought to arise from peripheral antigen stimulated B cells ; however , the clinical , pathological , and molecular heterogeneity of these lymphomas suggests their derivation from B cells of various stages of differentiation , and this heterogeneity was reflected in their BSAP expression .
The BSAP-negative LBCL cases might be derived from postfollicular transformed B cells representing the transition from mature B cells to plasma cells .
Almost half ( 10/24 [ 42 % ] ) of the LBCL cases , including all 3 mediastinal LBCL cases tested , displayed strong BSAP positivity .
The strong BSAP expression may be part of their malignant phenotype , representing overexpression of the protein .
Furthermore , the low surface Ig expression characteristic of mediastinal LBCLs*® may be related to their high-level expression of BSAP as a result of the Ig repressor function of BSAP .
Whether the variable expression level of BSAP in LBCLs defines clinically relevant subgroups remains to be tested .
52-kD band of expected size is demonstrated only in the B-cell lines ( D through J ) .
PB-697 and Nalm-6 also display a second band of 46 kD , which has a much lower intensity in Nalm-6 .
This band originates from a cytoplasmic cross-reactive protein that does not appear to be related to BSAP ( see text ) .
In addition to LPHD , which is generally accepted to be a B-cell process , '' '' weak BSAP expression was also found in 38 % ( 6/16 ) classical HD cases .
Our result is contrary to the findings in the HRS cell lines , L428 , HDLM-1 , and KM-H2 , in which BSAP was not detected by gel mobility shift assay . ''
The weak BSAP expression is consistent with the developing consensus of a B-cell derivation for classical HD in a high proportion of cases . '' ''
The nonrandom chromosomal translocation t ( 9 ; 14 ) ( p13 ; q32 ) has been reported in cases of the lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma subtype of NHL .
* '' This translocation was recently cloned and shown to result in the juxtaposition of the Ig heavy chain Sy region to the 9p13 locus , '' ** '' in which the PAX-5 gene has been mapped , '' % '' 5 leading to overexpression of the PAX-5 gene product . ''
This is further evidence that BSAP/PAX-5 may be involved in the pathogenesis of some B-cell lymphomas .
Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphomas are relatively rare ; in the current study , none was included .
B-cell-restricted expression of BSAP was also confirmed by Western blot analysis .
BSAP was detected in cell lines corresponding to precursor and mature B-cell stages , but not in terminally differentiated plasma cell , T-cell , or other hematopoietic cell lines ( Table 2 and Fig 3 ) .
In addition to the 52-kD band known to be specific for BSAP , a 46-kD band was also found in the lysate of the PB-697 cell line , a cell line derived from a patient with pre-B ALL .
A similar , although less prominent band was also found in lysates from the pre-B-cell line Nalm-6 .
Because we detected the 46-kD band only with the N-terminal BSAP-specific antiserum , it is likely to differ from the 52-kD form of BSAP at the carboxy-terminus .
Distinct Pax-5 isoforms generated by alternative splicing have been described in murine neural , B-lymphoid , and testicular tissues . ''
Although we initially though that the 46-kD band represented a distinct BSAP isoform , further analysis has suggested that it represents a cross-reactive band present in the two pre-B-cell lines .
In nonhematopoietic tumors , PAX gene products acquire their oncogenic activity through inappropriate expression and/or gain-of-function alterations .
The strong expression of PAX-5 found in B-cell lymphomas may possibly indicate a role for this paired box protein in some lymphomas .
On the other hand , because BSAP is strongly expressed normally during some stages of normal B-cell differentiation ( eg , mantle cells ) , we can only infer involvement of BSAP in those lymphomas for which the intensity of expression exceeded the expression level of the putative normal cellular counterpart ( deregulated expression ) .
In this respect , the strong BSAP expression in LBCL ( especially the mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas ) and some FLs can be considered to be particularly interesting for further analysis .
We conclude that BSAP expression is unique to the B-cell From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

BSAP EXPRESSION IN LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES lineage among hematopoietic cells and tumors .
Double-staining studies demonstrated that the vast majority of BSAP-positive cells coexpress CD20 and that few , if any , express CD3 .
BSAP levels vary among B-cell subsets and among subtypes of B-cell lymphoma , with the highest levels detected in normal and neoplastic mantle cells , in some FLs , and in a proportion of LBCL , including all mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas stud-ied .
In addition , weak BSAP expression was also detected in about one third of all classical HD cases .
We speculate that the high levels of BSAP , particularly those found in LBCL , and in some cases of FLs , may be a result of deregulated BSAP/PAX-5 expression , suggesting a possible role for PAX-5 in the pathogenesis of some B-cell malignancies .
