8 A Conserved Tissue-Specific Structure at a Human T-Cell Receptor B-Chain Core Promoter JORN-PETER HALLE , PHILIPP HAUS-SEUFFERT , CLAUDIA WOLTERING , GERTRAUD STELZER , AND MICHAEL MEISTERERNST* Laboratorium fiir Molekulare Biologie-Genzentrum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitiit Miinchen , D-81377 Munich , Germany Received 24 January 1997/Returned for modification 6 March 1997/Accepted 17 April 1997 The T-cell receptor ( TCR ) B-chain promoters have been characterized as nonstructured basal promoters that carry a single conserved ubiquitous cyclic AMP element .
Our investigation of the human TCR B gene uncovers a surprisingly complex and tissue-specific structure at the TCR VB 8.1 promoter .
The core of the promoter ( positions -42 to +11 ) is recognized by the lymphoid cell-specific transcription factors Ets-1 , LEF1 , and AML1 as well as by CREB/ATF-1 , as is demonstrated in gel shift and footprinting experiments .
With the exception of LEF1 , these factors activate transcription in T cells .
Binding sites at the core region show little conservation with consensus sites .
Nonetheless , CREB , Ets-1 , and AML1 bind and activate cooperatively and very efficiently through the nonconsensus binding sites at the core promoter region .
Moderate ubiquitous activation is further induced by CREB/ATF and Spl factors through proximal upstream elements .
The tissue-specific core promoter structure is apparently conserved in other T-cell-specifically expressed genes such as the CD4 gene .
Our observations suggest that both the enhancer and the promoter have a complex tissue-specific structure whose functional interplay potentiates T-cell-specific transcription .
T-cell-specific expression of the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -CD3 complex and the CD4-CD8 coreceptors depends on distal enhancer elements ( 8 , 18 , 22 , 29 , 31 , 38 , 46 , 64 , 78 , 80 ) , which is reminiscent of the B-cell-specific regulation of transcription of the immunoglobulin genes ( 4 ) .
The enhancers contain multiple binding sites for ubiquitous , lymphoid cell- and T-cell-specific factors ( reviewed in references 9 and 40 ) .
Many T-cell- and lymphoid cell-specific factors were initially identified because they bind to functional important elements of the TCR en-hancers .
Examples are members of the family of high-mobility-group ( HMG ) box-containing factors TCF1 and LEF1 ( T-cell factor 1 and lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 ) ( 74 , 75 , 77 ) , the zinc finger protein Ikaros ( 17 , 49 ) , and the runt domain factor PEBP2 « ( polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2a ) .
The latter , also called CBFa ( core binding factor a ) , is the murine homolog of human AML1 ( 52 ) , which is involved in the induction of acute myeloid leukemia ( reviewed in references 30 and 50 ) .
In addition , the lymphoid cell-specific factors Ets-1 , Elf-1 , and GATA3 as well as the ubiquitous CREB/ATF family bind to and activate the TCR enhancers ( 16 , 20 , 28 , 43 , 79 , 80 ) .
Expression of the TCR genes is dependent on distal enhancers ( 22 , 38 , 40 , 46 ) .
Like other tissue-specific and inducible enhancer elements ( for reviews , see references 72 and 73 ) , the TCR enhancers assemble the transcription factors in a complex multiprotein structure ( 19 , 20 ) .
The corresponding promoters are thought to contribute little to tissue-specific transcription of TCR genes ( 40 ) .
For example , sequence comparisons of the different B-chain promoters revealed only one conserved element ( 1 , 59 , 69 ) .
It resembles a cyclic AMP-responsive element ( CRE ) and is recognized by different members of the ubiquitous CREB/ATF family of transcription factors ( 2 , 16 , 39 ) .

4220 promoter suggested that the CRE is the only promoter element that is required for transcriptional activation ( 2 ) .
With the exception of the CRE , TCR promoters seemed to be un-related , based on previous reports ( 1 , 59 , 69 ) .
On certain individual promoters , functional binding of ubiquitous transcription factors such as Spl ( 37 ) and TFII-I ( 42 ) could be demonstrated .
In other cases , the involvement of additional lymphoid cell-specific factors has been predicted but not definitively demonstrated ( 7 , 11 , 48 , 58 , 60 ) .
The TCR enhancers can function through a variety of het-erologous and ubiquitous promoters ( 20 , 22 ) .
These findings appear to be consistent with a general role of promoters that assemble the basal machinery , being rather nonstructured and neither contributing substantially to tissue specificity nor displaying specificity in promoter-enhancer interactions .
In contrast to these descriptions , our investigations of the human TCR VB 8.1 promoter suggest that it is both tissue-specifically transcribed and highly structured .
We identified several nonconsensus elements at the core region and immediately upstream of it that are recognized and activated by both ubiquitous and lymphoid cell-specific factors .
Cooperativity on one hand between factors acting through the core promoter regions and on the other hand between the promoter and the enhancer establishes a mechanism for potentiation of tissue-specific transcription .

An antisense transcript of both promoters was generated with Sp6 polymerase .
Reporter gene assay .
Jurkat and HeLa cells were cultivated in RPMI medium containing 10 and 5 % fetal calf serum ( PAN Systems ) , respectively .
Cells were collected at densities of 5 X 10° to 8 X 10° ( Jurkat ) or 2 X 10° to 3 X 10° ( HeLa ) per ml and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline .
In standard reactions , approximately 1.6 X 10 '' Jurkat and 8 X 10° HeLa cells were mixed with 10 ug of luciferase reporter and 2 ug of CMV-B-galactosidase expression plasmids in 400 pl of RPMI medium lacking serum .
After 20 min , cells were electroporated in 0.4-cm cuvettes at 960 mF and 250 V ( Gene Pulser ; Bio-Rad ) .
After an additional 20 min , the cells were reseeded in 10 ml of RPMI medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum .
For maximum TCR B-gene activity ( 56 ) , 10 ng of phorbol-12-myristate ( Sigma ) per ml in dimethyl sulfoxide was added 4 h after electro-poration .
At 36 to 40 h after electroporation , cells were harvested , washed once in phosphate-buffered saline , and lysed in 150 pl of luciferase lysis buffer ( Promega ) for 20 min at room temperature .
Supernatants were clarified by centrif-ugation ( 2 min , 14,000 rpm ) ; 40 pl was mixed with 100 pl of luciferase assay solution ( Promega ) and analyzed in a Topcounter ( Canberra-Packard ) .
B-Galactosidase activity was determined by incubating 30 pl of the supernatant with 270 pl of B-galactosidase assay solution ( 63 ) and measurement of optical density at 420 nm .
Luciferase units were normalized to B-galactosidase values except when Sp1 expression vectors were cotransfected , which significantly stimulated the CMV promoter ; in the latter case , the luciferase values were normalized to total protein concentrations ( Fig .
3 ) .
All values were corrected by subtracting background activities of a vector lacking the promoter .
Data in the figures are the means of at least three experiments + standard errors of means .
When expression plasmids were present in cotransfection studies , total DNA was kept constant with the corresponding empty expression vectors .
RNase protection assays .
Poly ( A ) * RNA was isolated from cells 24 h after transfection of DNA plasmids by using Qiagen direct mRNA mini kits .
The RNA was hybridized to a `` P-labeled probe complementary to the TCR VB 8.1 promoter luciferase and CMV-B-galactosidase reporters .
RNase protection assays were performed as described previously ( 63 ) .
In vitro transcription reactions .
Preparation and purification of recombinant or native general transcription factors , TFIIA , TFIIB , TFIID , TFIE , TFHF , TFIIH , and RNA polymerase II , and the conditions used for the transcription reactions have been described previously ( 26 , 47 , 70 ) .
Transcriptions were conducted in the presence of 100 M all four nucleotides , and transcripts were analyzed by primer extension with an end-labeled primer complementary to the luciferase gene 28 bp downstream of the promoter cloning site with sequence CTTTATGTITTTGGCGTCTTCCA essentially as described previously ( 32 ) .

The human LEF1 cDNA ( 77 ) was amplified by PCR with a primer generating an amino-terminal Ndel site and cloned into the Nde !
site of pET11d .
LEF1 carrying an amino-terminal His tag was purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid columns .
Footprints and EMSA .
The footprints and the electromobility shift assays ( EMSA ) were performed on purified PCR fragments of the promoter produced with one labeled primer .
A labeled coding strand was used except in the CREB footprint , in which the noncoding strand was labeled .
Reaction mixtures included 40 fmol of the DNA fragment , 1 g of poly ( dI-dC ) , and the amounts of proteins indicated in the figures in 20 pl of 25 mM HEPES ( pH 8.2 ) -10 % glycerol-4 mM MgCl , -65 mM KCI-5 mM dithiothreitol-0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo-ride-500 ng of bovine serum albumin per pwl-0.002 % Nonidet P-40 and were incubated for 30 min at 25°C .
In EMSAs , the reactions were directly loaded onto a 4 % polyacrylamide gel ( 50:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide ) in 30 mM Tris-borate buffer ( pH 8.2 ) and run at 5 V/cm .
In footprinting experiments , DNase I ( Boehringer Mannheim ) was added in amounts and for periods indicated in the figure legends .
Reactions were stopped , purified , and analyzed on denaturing 8 % ( 19:1 ) acrylamide-bisacrylamide gels according to standard procedures .
RESULTS Structure and tissue specificity of the TCR VB 8.1 promoter .
In an attempt to understand tissue-specific regulation of the TCR B gene , we have reinvestigated the structure and function of the human VB 8.1 promoter , which is utilized in the recombined TCR B-chain gene locus in the human CD4* Jurkat T-cell line ( 11 ) .
The promoter region was initially defined with deletion constructs in transient transfection assays in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Promoter activity resided within an approximately 94-bp fragment spanning positions -83 to +11 relative to the major start site of transcription ( Fig .
1 ) ( 11 ) .
Constructs comprising positions -42 to +11 mediated approximately 50 % of the overall promoter activity ( Fig .
2A ) and were sufficient to initiate transcription from the major transcription start site in vivo , as shown in RNase protection assays ( Fig .
2B ; compare -42/+11 with -83/+11 ) .
This region ( positions -42 to +11 ) is subsequently termed the core promoter .
Utilizing the deletion constructs , we then investigated the tissue specificity of core and upstream promoter regions by comparing their activities in Jurkat and HeLa cells .
The VB promoter is active in Jurkat and HeLa cells , although lower luciferase units were measured in HeLa cells .
This finding points to the functions of both ubiquitous and lymphoid cell-specific factors .
Preferential transcription in T cells is suggested by normalization of luciferase units to either cotransfected CMV promoter/enhancer-driven B-galactosidase activities or activities of the ubiquitously transcribed SV40 promoter .
When the SV40 promoter is used as a standard , the promoter is about three times more active in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
Normalization to a CMV pro-moter-driven -galactosidase gene yielded levels sixfold above the corresponding activities in HeLa cells .
Lymphoid cell specificity resided entirely within positions -42 to +11 at the core promoter region ( Fig .
2A ) .
The core promoter could be further subdivided in at least two lymphoid cell-specific subregions .
Deletion of the region from -42 to -29 further reduced promoter activity in Jurkat but not HeLa cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
Low but reproducible activity was measured solely in Jurkat cells with a minimal promoter construct that included sequences surrounding the initiation start site ( positions -8 to +11 ) .
A third tissue-specific element , with weak activity , is located between positions -28 and -10 , as will be demonstrated below .
T-cell-specific activity has previously been reported for the CD4 core promoter ( 62 ) , which served here as a positive control ( Fig .
2A ) .

The TCR VB 8.1 promoter is more active in T cells .
( A ) Deletion constructs of the VB 8.1 promoter were analyzed in transient transfection assays in Jurkat ( filled bars ) and in HeLa cells ( open bars ) .
Positions included in constructs relative to the major transcription start site are indicated .
CMV-B-galactosidase served as an internal control within one cell type , and the SV40 promoter was used as a standard to normalize activities in HeLa and Jurkat cells .
The CD4 promoter ( 62 ) construct comprised core promoter sequences from -42 to +20 .
( B ) Analysis of TCR VB 8.1 mRNA in vivo by RNase protection .
RNA generated by transfected core ( -42/+11 ; lane 1 ) and full-length promoters ( -83/+11 ; lane 2 ) in Jurkat cells was analyzed .
Protected fragments originating from VB promoters ( TCR ) , cotransfected CMV-B-galactosidase ( CMV ) , read-through transcripts of full-length ( RT ) , core VB ( positions -42 to +11 ) ( RT '' ) , and CMV ( CMV-RT ) promoters and the positions of RNA size markers ( sizes in base pairs ) are indicated .
The protected transcripts of the TCR VB 8.1 promoter were approximately 200 bp , in agreement with the calculated 198 bp for a transcript starting from position +1 .
Proximal upstream regions contain binding sites for ubiquitous factors .
The CRE conserved in the TCR VB promoters is located between positions -53 and -60 at the VB 8.1 promoter ( Fig .
1 ) .
Despite the conservation of the CRE , it had very little effect on promoter activity , as concluded from comparisons of the -69/+11 and -42/+11 deletion constructs ( Fig .
3 ) and various point mutations ( data not shown ) .
The effect of the upstream region , which was seen in both HeLa and Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2A ) , was entirely mediated through an element further upstream ( positions -83 to -70 ) which resembled an Spl site ( Fig .
3 ) .

Sp1 but not CREB activates through upstream regulatory sequences .
Deletion constructs comprising positions indicated were analyzed in Jurkat cells in the absence ( black bars ) or presence ( open bars ) of 2 ug of cotransfected Sp1 expression vector ( CMV-hSp1 ) ( 25 ) if indicated .
The promoter was in cis and in trans dependent on Spl and the Spl element , respectively , but not on the CREB/ATF site ( CRE ) .
Positions relative to the initiation site ( INR ) are indicated .
n.d. , not determined .
been characterized as binding sites for Spl family members ( 67 ) in the TCR Va ( 37 ) and uteroglobin ( 24 ) promoters .
In support of a function of Spl through the VB promoter , overexpression of Spl in cotransfection experiments moderately but reproducibly stimulated the promoter , and this activation was dependent on the presence of the upstream Sp1 site ( Fig .
3 ) .
Hence , Sp1 may contribute to ubiquitous activity of the VB promoter .
CREB activates the promoter through a cryptic core promoter element .
Cotransfection of CREB or ATF-1 expression vectors also elevated promoter activity ( Fig .
4A ) .
Surprisingly , the approximately fivefold stimulation of the promoter by CREB did not require the upstream CRE but was solely dependent on the core promoter region , as demonstrated by comparisons of the different deletion constructs ( Fig .
4A ) .
Indeed , a partially conserved CREB/ATF binding site is found between positions -28 and -21 .
The core CRE contains three point mutations in the CREB consensus sequence , retaining one perfectly conserved half site ( Fig .
1 ) .
Lack of sequence conservation may have prevented the discovery in previous investigations of the core CRE , which is therefore termed a cryptic CRE .
Activation of the core promoter by CREB and ATF-1 was activator specific .
AP1 , which recognizes related sequences , analyzed through cotransfection of c-jun and c-fos expression vectors , did not stimulate the promoter ( Fig .
4B ) .
Activation by CREB required the protein kinase A-inducible domain , while a mutant that carries a serine-to-alanine mutation at residue 133 ( CREB-M1 ) ( 21 ) moderately but reproducibly repressed the promoter ( Fig .
4B ) .
This dominant negative effect is indicative of competition of the overexpressed mutant with endog- Vor .

The VB promoter strongly responds to Ets-1 and CREB/ATF-1 .
( A ) Core promoter-dependent activation is demonstrated in cotransfections with 1 g of expression vectors encoding CREB ( pRSV-CREB ) ( 21 ) or Ets-1 ( pEVRF-Ets-1 ) ( 20 ) in Jurkat cells .
Activation is dependent on the cryptic CREB ( CRE ) and Ets-1 ( ETS ) binding sites located at the core promoter .
INR , initiator region .
( B ) Activation is specific for CREB , ATF-1 ( ATF-1 eDNA [ 82 ] in pRe/CMV ) and Ets-1 and requires the CREB activation domain .
CREB-Ser133Ala carrying a mutation in the protein kinase A site is inactive ( pRSV-CREB-M1 ) ( 21 ) , as are AP1 ( c-jun and c-fos ; pRSV-cJ and pTK-FOS24 ) ( 36 ) and Elf-1 ( pCMV-Elf-1 ) ( 10 ) .
Expression plasmids ( 1 mg ) were cotransfected with standard concentrations of full-length VB -83/+11 promoter in Jurkat cells .
( C ) Analysis of pro-tein-DNA interactions in DNase I footprints ( 10 ng of DNase I for 1 min ) .
Recombinant CREB ( 1.5 ug ; lane 3 ) binds to the upstream CREB/ATF site ( US ; positions -61 to -54 ) and the cryptic core promoter CREB/ATF site ( positions -28 to -21 ) , the latter requiring 20-times-higher CREB concentrations .
Lane 1 , G+A reaction ; lane 2 , control ( Co. ) .
( D ) Recombinant GST-Ets-1 ( 5 pg ; lane 2 ) protected positions -9 to -32 in DNase footprinting experiments .

Lane 1 , control ; lane 3 , G+A reaction .
enous CREB/ATF-1 and provides indirect evidence that CREB/ATF proteins function through the core promoter at physiological concentrations at least in certain cell lines .
The function of CREB/ATF-1 transcription factors through the core may also explain the activity exhibited by the region spanning positions -28 to -9 in HeLa cells ( compare -28/+11 and -8/+11 in Fig .
2A ) .
Specific binding of CREB to the promoter was also demonstrated in in vitro footprinting experiments .
Recombinant non-phosphorylated CREB expressed in and purified from E. coli bound to both the upstream and the low-affinity core CRE ( Fig .
4C ) , although the conserved upstream CRE was protected at 20-fold-lower concentrations .
These data not only suggest a function of CREB through the VB core promoter but may also indicate that CREB proteins activate more efficiently TISSUE-SPECIFIC CORE PROMOTER - 4223 in close proximity to the initiator region ( Fig .
1 ) .
Beyond this promoter function of CREB , we have evidence that the upstream CRE mediates enhancer function , which may provide a reasonable explanation for its conservation in the different VB promoters ( 27 ) .
Overexpression of Ets-1 efficiently activates the core promoter .
Our initial characterization of the promoter ( Fig .
2A ) indicated the participation of additional factors at core promoter regions , which are restricted to Jurkat cells .
Tissue-specific core promoter activity has previously been described in the context of the CD4 promoter , which is activated by the lymphoid cell-specific Ets-1 protein ( 62 ) .
We could reproduce this finding by showing ( i ) that the CD4 promoter is inactive in HeLa cells but active in T cells ( Fig .
2A ) and ( ii ) that overexpression of Ets-1 switches the promoter on in HeLa cells ( 27 ) .
Here we tested the effects of Ets-1 on VB promoter activity , although homologies to Ets-1 consensus sites were weak .
However , Ets-1 could very efficiently ( up to 10-fold ) activate the VB promoter ( Fig .
4A ) .
Activation depended on the core promoter region which contains a cryptic Ets-1 site ( Fig .
1A ) .
Thus , both Ets-1 and CREB activate transcription very efficiently through VB core promoter regions .
Ets-1 but not the closely related factor Elf-1 stimulated the promoter ( Fig .
4B ) .
To characterize Ets-1 binding , footprinting experiments were conducted with recombinant protein ( Fig .
4D ) .
Ets-1 interacted specifically with the core region exhibiting the characteristic hypersensitive site within the protected region ( 23 ) .
Specific binding to the core promoter required high concentrations of expressed Ets-1 .
This may be partially explained by the known low affinity of Ets-1 for its own recognition site in the absence of other factors ( 20 , 35 ) .
In addition , the affinity for the nonconserved VB core promoter element between positions -17 and -9 may be particularly low .
In contrast to CREB , the concentrations of Ets-1 apparently do not suffice to significantly activate the promoter , as this region of the promoter displayed very little T-cell specificity in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
However , it has been reported that Ets-1 concentrations vary during differentiation ( 6 , 44 ) and activation ( 5 , 55 ) of T cells , leaving open the possibility that Ets-1 activates the VB promoter at some point during development .
In any event , we note a potent capacity of Ets-1 to induce the promoter through core promoter elements .
Conserved AML1 and LEF sites at the core promoter .
In Jurkat cells , factors other than Ets-1 must be responsible for tissue-specific core promoter effects .
Sequence analysis of the core promoter revealed partially conserved binding sites for AML1/PEBP2 « /CBF ( hereafter termed AML1 ) between positions -42 and -29 and for TCF/LEF immediately upstream of the initiation site of transcription ( Fig .
1 ) .
Footprinting experiments proved that recombinant LEF1 and AML1 proteins could indeed bind to the predicted sites ( Fig .
5A ) .
Both factors also protected sites in the upstream promoter region against DNase I digestion .
These recognition sites overlap the Sp1 and CREB/ATF sites , respectively .
Expression of AML1 in Jurkat cells activated the promoter up to threefold ( Fig .
5B ) .
This activation was dependent on the core but not on the upstream binding site , which overlaps the Sp1 site .
Hence , the lymphoid cell-specific AML protein functions through the core promoter .
Mutations in the upstream LEF1 binding site had no influence on promoter activity ( Fig .
6A ) .
In contrast , mutations in the two core promoter LEF1 sites reduced promoter activity ( Fig .
6A ) .
The importance of these sites is suggested by their conservation within several TCR VB promoters ( Fig .
6B ) .
Also , the lymphoid cell-specific CD4 core promoter is remarkably related to the TCR VRB 8.1 core promoter .

AML1 ( PEBP2 « ) and LEF bind to and AML1 activates the VB promoter .
( A ) Binding of recombinant DNA binding domain of AML1 ( lane 2 , 40 ng ; lane 3 , control [ Co. ] ) and full-length LEF1 ( lane 4 , 200 ng ) was analyzed in DNase I footprinting experiments ( 10 ng of DNase I for 1 min ) .
On the left , the positions relative to the transcription start site are indicated ( lane 1 , G+A reaction ) .
AML1 protected positions -39 to -29 and less efficiently positions -79 and -70 , and LEF1 protected positions -69 to -58 and positions -8 to +5 , as indicated on the right .
On the other DNA strand , LEF1 protected positions -8 to +11 ( data not shown ) .
( B ) Cotransfection of 2 pg of pCG-PEBP2 « ( 20 ) , comprising amino acids 35 to 501 of AML1 ( 52 ) , activated dependent on the AML1 site ( AML ) located between positions -42 and -29 .
Activation of AML1 through the upstream binding site , which was found in in vitro footprinting experiments and which overlaps with the Sp1 recognition site , was not detectable .
INR , initiator region .
the CD4 promoter include the initiation start site and the Ets-1 , AML1 , and both putative LEF1 binding sites but not the core CRE ( Fig .
6C ) .
Absence of the latter provides an explanation for the lack of activity of the CD4 promoter in HeLa cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
Transient LEF1 expression did not stimulate the promoter in T cells , and we did not yet succeed in reconstituting the activity of the minimal core promoter ( positions -8 to +11 ) in HeLa cells Hence , we can not exclude the involvement of other activators .
These , however , could also be other members of the TCF/LEF family .
The location of the conserved region in the immediate vicinity of the initiator raises the possibility that it might affect the activity of general transcription factors .
The VB core promoter contains two basal elements , a residual TATA box and an initiator region .
The latter closely resembles the initiator consensus sequence ( 33 ) with the notable exception of a G residue at position +3 ( Fig .
1A ) .

A conserved functional TCF/LEF-like element at the core promoter .
( A ) Mutations within both core promoter LEF1 binding sites ( LEF ) , designed to not change the partially overlapping upstream CRE and the initiator ( INR ) consensus sequences ( Fig .
1 ) , but not within the upstream site reduce promoter activity .
Mutations were TTCAGTGA to TTCgaTGA ( in the -69/+11 con-struct ) , TCTTTGCT to and CTCACAGA to CTCeataA in the three putative LEF boxes , and , to inactivate the initiator , CTCA , ,TGCT to gegA , i TGCT , all in the -83/+11 context .
( B ) The sequences surrounding the initiator are conserved in different TCR VB promoters , as shown by alignment ( 1 , 69 ) of the initiator regions and comparison to the consensus sequence of LEFI .
Homologies to the consensus sequences are in boldface .
( C ) Several regulatory elements are conserved between the TCR VB and the CD4 core promoter , as shown by alignment of promoters and comparison of consensus sequences of activator recognition sites .
Homologies to the consensus sequences are shown in boldface .
( D ) In vitro analysis of core promoters in a purified transcription system .
The wild-type promoter ( WT ; lane 1 ) , the downstream LEF ] mutation ( DS-MT ; lane 2 ) , a conversion of the initiator to the consensus sequence ( CTCA , ; THCT ) ( INR-CS ; lane 3 ) , and an initiator down-mutation as shown in panel A ( INR-MT ; lane 4 ) were analyzed by primer extension .
Positions refer to the major in vivo transcription start site .
Transcription start sites upstream and downstream of +1 are observed as minor transcription start sites that do not substantially contribute to the promoter activity in nuclear extracts in vitro ( 27 ) and in vivo ( Fig .
1 and reference 11 ) .
Note that due to the translation initiation codon at positions +1 to +3 , which is out of frame with the luciferase open reading frame and with the TCR B coding region in the native context transcripts starting from upstream sites will probably not contribute to protein expression .
Vor .
17 , 1997 consensus sequence strongly reduced promoter activity ( Fig .
6A ) .
The initiator but not the TATA box is important for basal promoter activity .
The basal elements alone are not sufficient to confer measurable promoter activity in T cells ( 27 ) .
However , sequences surrounding the initiator might also affect the function of other general factors such as TFIIE ( 32 ) .
We have investigated this issue by analyzing core promoter constructs in a purified HeLa-derived in vitro transcription system .
This system contains a complete set of general transcription factors but is devoid of regulatory factors .
Transcripts started from several sites in purified systems ( Fig .
6D ) .
These were generated by RNA polymerase II , as demonstrated by inhibition with « -amanitin ( data not shown ) .
Upstream start sites , i.e. , at position -12 , probably do not contribute to gene activity in vivo , as the promoter contains an ATG start codon at position +1 ( Fig .
1 ) .
Mutations in the downstream LEF1 site barely affected transcription from the major start site ( Fig .
6D ) , though they led to qualitative changes at the minor transcription start site at position +9 .
Similarly , mutations in the second LEF1 , the AML , the CREB , and the Ets elements did not affect basal promoter activity ( 27 ) .
In contrast , the mutation within the initiator consensus sequence ( positions -3 to +1 from CTCA to GGGA ) abolished starts of transcription from position +1 ( lane 4 ) .
Generation of an initiator consensus sequence , by changing position +3 from G to T , did not influence basal transcription ( lane 3 ) .
These data show that mutations in the LEF1 sites indeed impair the function of regulatory but not of general factors .
While not yet identifying unambiguously the specific activators acting through the LEF1 binding sites , our data provide indications for a T-cell-specific core promoter structure that is conserved in several promoters .
Cooperativity in binding and activation of core promoters .
The complex structure of the TCR VfB 8.1 promoter is remarkably reminiscent of the corresponding enhancer complexes ( 20 , 40 ) .
Many of the activators which are shown here to bind to the TCR promoter are also part of the TCR enhancer complexes .
The arrangement is not identical but in some situations is similar .
For example , ETS elements are usually located in the vicinity of AML1 recognition sites .
On the enhancers , these transcription factors bind cooperatively and activate synergis-tically ( 20 , 79 ) .
Similarly , we could show that Ets-1 binding to the cryptic core sites is enhanced , if CREB binds to the adjacent core CRE ( Fig .
7A ; compare lane 2 with lane 5 ) .
Surprisingly , the Ets-CREB complex comigrated with the Ets-1 complex seen at higher concentrations ( compare lane 3 with lane 5 ) .
Also , the CREB-Ets-1 complex displayed reduced mobility at high Ets-1 concentrations ( compare lanes 5 and lane 6 ) .
Ets-CREB complexes were supershifted with antibodies against both proteins ( data not shown ) .
Hence , the low mobility of Ets-1 alone may be explained by the binding of two Ets-1 molecules at higher concentrations ( lane 3 ) .
Cooperativity in binding to the T-cell enhancers has been described in the cases of AML1 and Ets-1 ( 20 , 79 ) .
In agreement with these observations , we could also observe cooperative binding of the AML1 DNA binding domain and Ets-1 at the TCR VRB 8.1 promoter both in EMSAs ( data not shown ) and in footprinting experiments ( Fig .
7B ) .
At limiting factor concentrations , allowing no individual footprints , the combination of Ets-1 and AML1 produced a footprint at the core promoter region ( compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 6 ) .
Similarly , binding of CREB to the core promoter assisted Ets-1 binding ( compare lanes 2 and 3 ) .
In combination , the three factors moderately but significantly protected the core promoter more efficiently ( lane 7 ) .
We could not detect cooperative binding of CREB and the AML1 DNA binding domain in footprinting experiments ( data not shown ) .

Cooperative binding of activators to the core promoter .
( A ) Gel mobility shift experiments using a core promoter oligonucleotide comprising positions -42 to +11 .
Increasing amounts of Ets-1 ( 0 ng [ lane 1 and 4 ] , 200 ng [ lanes 2 and 5 ] , and 1 g [ lanes 3 and 6 ] ) were analyzed in the absence ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or presence ( lanes 4 to 6 [ 100 ng ! )
of CREB .
CREB and Ets-1 bind cooperatively at lower Ets-1 concentrations ( compare lanes 2 and 5 ) , leading to a complex with reduced mobility ( lane 5 ) .
( B ) Footprinting analyses with CREB , Ets-1 , and AML1 at limiting activator concentrations .
CREB ( 0.5 pg ; lanes 2 , 3 , and 7 ) , Ets-1 ( 1 pg ; lanes 3 , 4 , and 6 ) , and the AML1 DNA binding domain ( 10 ng ; lanes 5 to 7 ) were analyzed on a full-length promoter fragment including positions -83 to +11 and additional restriction sites on both ends ; DNase I ( 40 ng ) was applied for 10 s. Binding sites as deduced from single activator footprints ( Fig .
4C , 4D , and 5A ) are indicated .
CREB ( lane 2 ) completely protected the upstream CRE ( US ) and to a lesser extent the core CRE .
Two hypersensitive sites within the core promoter are seen .
Addition of limiting amounts of Ets-1 ( lane 3 ) , which did not lead to a footprint alone ( lane 4 ) , enhanced the core promoter footprint and led to disappearance of the hypersensitive sites induced by CREB .
Similarly , the hypersensitive site at -19 observed in the Ets-1 footprint at saturating concentrations ( Fig .
4D ) disappeared in the CREB-Ets-1 footprint .
At limiting concentrations , combinations of AML1 and Ets-1 but not the individual factors protected the core promoter against DNase I digestion ( lanes 4 to 6 ) .
Addition of CREB to the AML1-Ets-1 complex further enhanced core promoter footprints and protected the upstream CRE ( lane 7 ) .
that the full-length AML1 protein cooperates with CREB .
It is also possible that cooperativity is further amplified at the level of transcriptional activation .
In Jurkat nuclear extracts , the promoter is completely protected at low overall protein concentrations , indicative for cooperativity between the natural factors ( data not shown ) .
Cooperativity between Ets-1 , CREB , and AML1 was also seen in cotransfection experiments in Jurkat cells .
Ets-1 and CREB stimulated the full-length promoter 8- and 6-fold , respectively , while cotransfection of both expression vectors yielded a 26-fold activation , thereby exceeding additive effects ( Fig .
8A ) .
Cooperativity was even more pronounced if limiting amounts of Ets-1 and CREB expression vectors were cotransfected ( 2.5- and 2-fold , respectively , versus 7.5-fold for the combination [ Fig .
8BJ ] ) .
Similarly , combinations of AML1 with Ets-1 and CREB exceeded additive effects ( Fig .
8A and B ) .
The combination of the three activators could stimulate the promoter up to 70-fold .

Cooperative activation by activators that function through the low-affinity binding sites on the core promoter .
( A ) Ets-1 cooperatively activates with both CREB and AML1 .
Combinations of 1 ug of CREB , 1 ug of Ets-1 , and 2 pg of AML1 expression vectors were cotransfected with the full-length promoter construct ( -83/+11 ) .
( B ) Cooperativity at limiting amounts of expression vectors .
Transfections were performed as for panel A , but amounts of the individual expression vectors were reduced fivefold .
( C ) Consensus core promoter binding sites abolish cooperativity in cotransfection experiments .
The core promoter CREB and Ets-1 site were mutated to consensus binding sites ( from AAATGTCA to TGACGTCA and from AAAATTCATT to ACACTTCCTG , respectively ) , and stimulation by CREB and Ets-1 was analyzed as for panel A .
It should be noted , however , that this cooperativity is not sufficient to generate saturating numbers of core promoter complexes .
In fact , the promoter responds to overexpression of the different factors under conditions under which the enhancer is not further activated ( 27 ) .
This finding argues for the importance of high-affinity binding sites on enhancers , despite a certain degree of cooperativity that stabilizes the Ets-CREB-AML-promoter complexes in the presence of low-affinity recognition sites .
When the low-affinity CREB and Ets-1 core promoter binding sites were changed to consensus , high-affinity sites , the promoter activity increased 10-fold in Jurkat cells ( 27 ) .
This most likely indicated enhanced binding of endoge-nous factors to the improved sites .
Indeed , cotransfection even of high amounts of the CREB expression vector did not further stimulate the promoter , arguing for complete occupancy of the up-mutated CRE .
Similarly , relative activation by Ets-1 cotransfection was reduced by the improved core promoter binding sites ( compare Fig .
8A and C ) .
Interestingly , the consensus sites abolished the cooperativity of CREB and Ets-1 observed on the wild-type promoter .
Hence , low-affinity core promoter sites allow for cooperative concentration-dependent regulation of the promoter activity , whereas high-affinity sites elicit a constitutive activity .
Tissue-specific promoter structure is important for enhancer and overall gene activity .
In agreement with the lack of expression of the TCR B gene in the absence of the enhancer , the promoter accounts for only about 1 % of the overall gene activity ( Fig .
9 ) .
A construct comprising positions -83 to +11 is 100-fold stimulated by the native enhancer cloned at a distal position .
This experiment demonstrated that the 94-bp promoter construct was necessary and sufficient to facilitate maximal enhancer function .
Deletion of the regulatory elements of the promoter not only reduced the promoter activity ( Fig .
2A ) but also strongly impaired relative enhancer and absolute gene activity ( Fig .
9 ) .
Furthermore , core promoter regions comprising positions -42 to -9 efficiently raised enhancer activity .
Hence , the regulatory regions at the promoter , including T-cell-specific elements ( Fig .
9 and reference 27 ) , cooperate with the enhancer , with overall gene activity exceeding synergistic levels .
This observation provides evidence for the relevance of the promoter structure in the presence of the enhancer and establishes a mechanism for potentiation of tissue-specific expression of the TCR B gene .
DISCUSSION Many tissue-specifically expressed genes are regulated by highly structured cell-specific distal enhancer elements .
Enhancers act through promoters that are frequently controlled by ubiquitous activators and general transcription factors .
Likewise , the family of TCR B genes appeared to employ nonstructured , ubiquitous , weak basal promoters that contain a single conserved regulatory CRE .
Our analysis of the human TCR VB 8.1 promoter suggests that this picture is superficial , at least in the case of the VB 8.1 promoter .
In contrast to previous investigations , we find a complex and tissue-specific structure that is important for promoter activity , structurally resembles the TCR enhancers , and potentiates both promoter 160 ~ 120 .

Efficient enhancer function requires regulatory promoter regions .
Promoter constructs were analyzed in combination with the TCR B enhancer in a distal position ( 2.5 kbp from the promoter ) .
The relative stimulation of transcription by the enhancer is given .

17 , 1997 and enhancer activity .
The core region of the promoter , here defined as positions -42 to +11 , harbors several cryptic regulatory elements .
Certain activators such as Ets-1 and CREB are shown to function surprisingly well through the low-affinity binding sites at core promoters in the vicinity of the start site of transcription .
Interestingly , the tissue-specific structure of the VB promoter appears to be conserved in the CD4 promoter and in part also in other TCR VRB and the Va promoters .
Thus , these observations might be relevant in the context of other genes .
CREB activates efficiently through cryptic binding sites at the core promoter .
The structure and tissue specificity of the VB 8.1 and other promoters may have been underestimated in earlier investigations for two reasons .
First , many of the functional elements may contain nonconsensus low-affinity binding sites for regulatory factors that are not detected by sequence comparisons but are cooperatively bound by regulatory proteins .
Second , promoter activity is mostly low , reaching approximately 1 % of the overall gene activity in the presence of distal enhancers , making it difficult to measure the influence of the individual sites at the promoters , whose characterization is now facilitated by more sensitive reporters .
Generally , low promoter activity is consistent with the in vivo observations ex-plaining , for example , lack of TCR expression in the absence of enhancers in animals .
In addition to identifying several tissue-specific elements , we could also confirm the contribution of ubiquitous proteins such as Spl and CREB to promoter activity .
The CRE is highly conserved , and also Sp1 recognition sites have been described in the context of others such as the TCR Va promoter ( 37 ) .
CREB/ATF factors bind to the upstream CRE that is conserved between most TCR VB promoters ( 1 , 2 , 16 , 39 , 59 ) .
Surprisingly , CREB and also ATF-1 activate transcription efficiently through the core region but barely affect promoter activity through the conserved upstream CRE .
The conserved high-affinity element could also not modulate promoter activity in cis .
This may be understandable in the light of recent investigations which showed that the upstream CRE is more important for enhancer than for promoter activity ( 27 ) .
Potentiation of enhancer activity provides a very efficient mechanism to raise overall gene activity , which exceeds by far the activity of the isolated intact promoter .
Similar functions were assigned to the Sp1 site and other regulatory elements in the core promoter ( 27 ) .
Nonetheless , the capacity of the low-affinity CRE at the core promoter is surprising , considering that the inactive high-affinity CRE is located only 30 bp further upstream ( Fig .
1A ) .
Similarly , Ets-1 functioned more efficiently in the proximity of the start site of transcription at both the VB and CD4 promoters ( 27 ) .
Although we can not fully exclude the involvement of other regulatory components in activation of Ets and CREB through sites between positions -30 and -10 relative to the major start site of transcription , at the present time there is no evidence for it .
No additional ubiquitous regulatory elements were detected in core promoters , and CREB and Ets-1 activated transcription equally well in HeLa and T cells .
On certain genes , activators such as E2F ( 68 ) have been shown to function through the core region , while the vast majority of regulatory sites are located upstream of core promoters .
The basal transcription machinery assembles at core promoters covering large regions extending from positions -40 to +20 , or even further downstream , in part on both sides of the DNA ( recently reviewed in reference 53 ) .
This implies that core activators might sterically interfer with preinitiation complex assembly and thereby inhibit transcription .
However , TISSUE-SPECIFIC CORE PROMOTER - 4227 for reasons that remain to be elucidated , CREB and Ets-1 induce transcription very efficiently at core promoters .
Tissue specificity of the VB 8.1 promoter .
The VB promoter is targeted by several tissue-specific factors , including Ets-1 , LEF1 , and AML1 .
The relevance of individual elements in vivo is difficult to predict .
Although we have not yet performed these studies in different lymphoid cell lines , several reasons argue for their relevance .
Ets-1 , LEF1 , and AML1 proteins are expressed early in the thymus and throughout T-cell development ( 9 ) .
All factors are integral parts of individual , and some are integral parts of all , members of the distal TCR enhancer complexes ( 9 , 20 , 40 ) .
Moreover , Ets-1 and AML1 activate the VB promoter when introduced in nonlymphoid cells .
The position of the Ets-1 site is precisely conserved in the CD4 promoter , and ETS-like elements have been found in the TCR VB 2 and the TCR V8 1 promoters ( 48 , 58 ) .
Specific binding , the conservation of the recognition site , and the T-cell specificity of the elements surrounding the start site of transcription suggest a role of the group of LEF/TCF HMG box proteins in regulation of the VB promoter .
Different members of the HMG box proteins have been isolated ; some are found in various tissues , which could complicate the analysis of defined proteins such as LEF1 ( 12 , 74 , 75 , 77 ) .
It is also possible that LEF1 requires other components present in the genomic environment or exhibits a more complex architectural role which might not be detectable in transient transfection assays ( 20 , 65 ) .
As described above , we also found ubiquitous proteins that raise promoter activity .
However , it is possible that the influence of lymphoid factors was underestimated by using the SV40 promoter as a standard .
The SV40 promoter is activated by Sp1 ( 13 ) , which has been reported to be present in high concentrations in T cells ( 61 ) .
Further in support of this as-sumption , normalization of luciferase activities to CMV promoter activities yielded even higher activities of the VB promoter in T cells .
Earlier investigations , indicating T-cell-specific elements at the VB promoter without defining factors acting through these upstream elements ( 11 , 60 ) , were not confirmed under our experimental conditions .
Cooperativity at the core promoter and between promoter and enhancer .
Ets-1 , CREB , and AML1 bind and activate transcription cooperatively at the VB core promoter .
This is reminiscent of the TCRa « and other TCR enhancers ( 20 , 79 ) on which Ets-1 and AML1 bind cooperatively to adjacent sites .
Here we also describe cooperativity between Ets-1 and CREB in both binding and transcriptional activation .
This was not evident in earlier direct protein-protein interaction studies , conducted in the absence of DNA , in which Ets-1 interacted specifically with ATF-2 ( 20 ) .
While we can not exclude a role of ATF-2 at the promoter , our data suggest that cooperativity between Ets-1 and CREB requires the presence of the two adjacent DNA recognition sites .
Somewhat surprising , Ets-1 but not by Elf-1 acted through the core promoters , which is not expected from the binding site at the promoter ( 76 ) .
This may indicate that regions other than the DNA binding domains are involved in cooperative interactions at core promoters .
Alter-natively , Elf-1 may not have the capacity to activate transcription at core promoters .
Cooperativity probably facilitates factor binding to the low-affinity sites and thereby potentiates tissue-specific transcription .
For example , CREB is ubiquitously expressed , Ets-1 is expressed in both T and B cells , and the hematopoietic expression of AML1 is restricted to thymocytes ( 9 ) .
Interactions between the proteins that promote complex assembly might also support looping of distal enhancers toward promoters ( 3 , 41 , 45 , 54 , 57 , 71 ) .
Given the increasing numbers of regulatory 4228 HALLE ET AL .
elements located in the core promoter regions of enhancer-regulated genes ( 14 , 15 , 34 , 62 , 81 ) , cooperation between activators on the core promoter and the enhancer may not be restricted to TCR genes .
Indeed , the promoter structure is important for enhancer activity , as the complete but not a minimal promoter is efficiently activated by the distal TCR VRB enhancer in Jurkat cells .
While we have not investigated physical enhancer-promoter interactions , potentiation of enhancer activity by the regulatory promoter regions clearly underlines the relevance of this promoter study and establishes an intriguing mechanism for amplification and regulation of T-cell-specific transcription .
