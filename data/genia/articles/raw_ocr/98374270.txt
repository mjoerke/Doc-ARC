*Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology and *Department of Biochemistry , Mount Sinai School of Medicine , New York , NY 10029 Edited by Gary Felsenfeld , National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , Bethesda , MD , and approved June 19 , 1998 ( received for review April 23 , 1998 ) ABSTRACT Erythroid Kriippel-like factor ( EKLF ) is a red cell-specific transcriptional activator that is crucial for consolidating the switch to high levels of adult 3-globin expression during erythroid ontogeny .
EKLF is required for integrity of the chromatin structure at the -like globin locus , and it interacts with a positive-acting factor in vivo .
We find that EKLF is an acetylated transcription factor , and that it interacts in vivo with CBP , p300 , and P/CAF .
However , its interactions with these histone acetyltransferases are not equivalent , as CBP and p300 , but not P/CAF , utilize EKLF as a substrate for in vitro acetylation within its trans-activation region .
The functional effects of these interactions are that CBP and p300 , but not P/CAF , enhance EKLF 's transcriptional activation of the -globin promoter in erythroid cells .
These results establish EKLF as a tissue-specific transcription factor that undergoes post-translational acetylation and suggest a mechanism by which EKLF is able to alter chromatin structure and induce { -globin expression within the -like globin cluster .
Expression of the B-like globin cluster relies on the controlled interplay of cellular components at a number of levels during erythroid ontogeny ( 1-7 ) .
First , the appropriate combination of general and cell-specific DNA-binding factors directs transcription in a tissue- and developmental-specific fashion .
Second , these transcriptional controls are placed within a chromatin context that itself exhibits tissue- and developmental-specific changes in structure .
Structural analyses of the locus , genetic analyses of relevant hemoglobinopathies , the isolation of red cell-specific transcriptional players , and the ability to reproduce correct tissue and developmental regulation of the fB-like globin cluster in transgenic mice have led to the identification of cis- and trans-acting components that act together to accomplish this feat .
However , the molecular details of how such exquisite long-range regulation is attained are far from resolved , although recent studies of protein-protein interactions and the use of compound homozygous mice have provided some additional insights ( 8 ) .
Erythroid Kriippel-like factor ( EKLF ) is a red cell-specific transcription factor that activates the B-globin promoter by means of its high-affinity binding to the CACCC element located at -90 ( 9 ) .
It contains three C2H2 zinc fingers that discriminate between CACCC elements present at erythroid promoters ( 10 , 11 ) .
Its preferential binding to the adult B CACCC element over the elements at the murine and human embryonic ( # ) or human fetal ( y ) globin genes raised the possibility that EKLF may be involved in the developmental switch from embryonic/fetal to adult globin expression ( 12 ) .
Molecular and genetic analyses verified that EKLF is absolutely critical for the onset in expression of the adult B-globin The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

9855 gene , as homozygous EKLF-null mice die at the time of the switch to adult expression because of a profound B-thalasse-mia , and EKLF-null embryonic stem cells do not contribute to the red cell population in chimeric mice ( 12-15 ) .
However , further analyses of EKLF-null mice , particularly after crossing with a mouse line that contained a single copy of the human B-like globin locus , revealed not only that human -globin transcripts were absent from the mouse fetal liver but also that y-globin transcripts were 5-fold higher and persisted beyond the level seen in the presence of EKLF ( 16 , 17 ) .
Additionally , the absence of EKLF led to a complete lack of DNase-hypersensitive site formation at both the transgenic and endogenous B-globin promoters , and diminution of HS3 at the globin locus control region ( LCR ) ( 17 ) .
These data indicate that EKLF is a major player in activating adult B-globin expression , not only by its transcriptional activation properties but also by its ability to generate the proper chromatin configuration within part of the B-like globin locus and thus facilitate the silencing of the y-globin promoter .
Part of these effects are likely because of the EKLF transactivation domain , which bears no homology to other proteins but is proline rich and is required for cell- and promoter-specific inducible expression ( 18 ) .
This domain is multipartite , containing a cis-acting inhibitory domain next to the zinc fingers , and a minimal activation domain that , by in vivo competition analyses , overlaps the EKLF trans-acting interaction domain ( 19 ) .
These studies revealed that EKLF interacts with a positive-acting cellular factor .
The molecular attributes of EKLF , in the context of its biological properties , led us to consider whether EKLF might be associating with molecules that alter chromatin structure ( 20 ) .
We focused on the particular class of coactivators that exhibit histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) activity for a number of reasons .
First , histone acetylation and transcriptional activation are intimately associated ( 21 , 22 ) .
Second , the B-like globin locus is enriched in acetylated histones in erythroid cells ( 23 ) .
Third , HAT 's utilize multiple mechanisms to exert a range of effects that could account for some of the in vivo properties exhibited by EKLF .
For example , they can serve as bridging molecules between activators and the basal transcription machinery ( 24 , 25 ) , their intrinsic HAT activity can disrupt the nucleosome structure and allow other DNA-binding proteins greater accessibility ( 26 ) , and they can alter the molecular properties of at least one nonhistone transcription factor , p53 ( 27 ) .
Our results demonstrate that EKLF associates with HAT 's and that this interaction leads to protein acetylation in This paper was submitted directly ( Track II ) to the Proceedings office .

EKLF thus becomes a tissue-specific example of the factor acetyltransferase ( FAT ) capability of p300 and CBP and their ability to modulate transcription factor function .

RESULTS EKLF Associates with CBP , p300 , and P/CAF in Vivo .
We began our studies by determining whether EKLF could interact in vivo with three proteins that contain HAT activity : CBP , p300 , and P/CAF .
Constructs that drive expression of each of these ( pRSV-CBP , pCMVB/HA-p300 , or pCX/FLAG-P/ CAF ) were cotransfected with the EKLF expression vector ( pSGS-EKLF ) into COS7 cells .
After 36 hr , cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP , anti-HA ( for p300 ) , or anti-P/CAF antibodies , and the material was monitored for the presence of EKLF after electrophoresis , transfer , and Western blot analysis with the anti-EKLF ( 4B9 ) antibody .
As shown in Fig .
14 , antibodies to each of the HAT proteins are able to coprecipitate EKLF from extracts ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 ) .
This result requires cotransfection of HAT protein and EKLF ( lanes 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ) .
This interaction was confirmed by the reverse experiment , i.e. , immunoprecipitation with anti-EKLF ( 6B3 ) antibody followed by blotting with anti-HA also reveals the p300/EKLF interaction ( Fig .
1B ) .
We conclude that CBP , p300 , and P/CAF can all interact with EKLF in vivo .
CBP and p300 , but Not P/CAF , Acetylate EKLF in Vitro .
Although CBP and p300 were originally isolated as coactivators that act as bridging proteins between upstream activators and the basal transcription apparatus ( 34 ) , the recent demonstration of their FAT activity on p53 ( 27 ) and Biochemistry : Zhang and Bicker TFIIER and TFIIF ( 35 ) prompted us to determine if EKLF is a substrate for acetylation by CBP , p300 , or P/CAF .
We performed these experiments in vitro by using purified recom-binant GST-EKLF fusion proteins as substrates for immunoprecipitated HAT molecules derived from transfected COS7 cells .
Fig .
24 demonstrates that CBP and p300 are both able to acetylate a GST-EKLF ( 76-376 ) construct in vitro ( lanes 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) ; however , P/CAF is not able to do so ( lanes 6 , 7 ) .
Autoacetylated CBP , p300 , and P/CAF bands indicate that the HAT molecule in each immunoprecipitated complex is enzy-matically active .
In addition , IP of nontransfected COS7 cells did not yield any acetylated EKLF ( lanes 3 , 8 ) , and EKLF did not autoacetylate ( lane 9 ) .
These data demonstrate that EKLF is specifically acetylated only by p300 and CBP , and not by P/CAF .
We used the robust signal generated by CBP acetylation in vitro to map potential target sites within EKLF .
A series of GST fusion proteins harboring different EKLF deletions were used as substrates ( Fig .
2B ) .
The EKLF trans-activation region contains five lysines that are conserved in the human and the murine orthologues ( 9 , 36 ) .
Analysis of the substrate suitability of the EKLF fragments ( Fig .
2B ) indicates that Lys-47 and Lys-71 are not used , but that Lys-279 and Lys-288 are likely target sites .
Both of these are located within the EKLF inhibitory domain immediately on the amino side of the zinc fingers .

These data directly demonstrate that EKLF is an acetylated transcription factor in vivo .
CBP and p300 , but Not P/CAF , Enhance EKLF Transactivation in Erythroid Cells .
To investigate the functional consequence of physical interaction and acetylation of EKLF by HAT molecules , we tested the effect of HAT proteins on the ability of EKLF to transactivate the B-globin promoter , which is its normal activation target ( 9 ) .

used K562 , which is a human erythroleukemic cell line that does not express EKLF ( 36 ) .
K562 cells express the fetal y-globin gene but not the endogenous or a transfected adult -globin gene .
However , cotransfection of EKLF with a B-globin gene reporter construct switches on its expression ( 12 ) .
We reasoned that use of the natural B-globin promoter in an erythroid cell would provide a stringent test for any effect of HAT proteins upon EKLF trans-activation .
Cotransfection of pSGS-EKLF and the pHS2/B/luc reporter were performed with pSGS5-CBP , pCMVB/HA-p300 , pCX/FLAG-P/CAF , or their corresponding empty vectors .
The results ( Fig .
4 ) indicate that EKLF activates the B-globin reporter as expected , and that CBP and p300 can further boost this high level of activity an additional 2- to 3-fold in a dose-dependent fashion ( Fig .
4 A-C ) .
However , P/CAF significantly inhibits EKLF transactivation by 6-fold ( Fig .
4D ) .
Trans-activation in the presence of TSA can further potentiate the effects of CBP and p300 , but not P/CAF , activation .
These data suggest that the functional consequence of interaction between EKLF and CBP or p300 is to positively affect its transactivational ability , maybe in part as a result of EKLF acetylation .
DISCUSSION EKLF is an erythroid transcription factor that plays direct or indirect roles in activation of B-globin transcription ( 12-14 ) , consolidation of the switch from y- to B-globin ( 16 , 17 ) , and generation of an intact chromatin structure at the B-like globin locus ( 17 ) .
As EKLF interacts with other proteins in vivo ( 19 ) , we investigated whether HAT 's might play a role in helping coordinate EKLEF 's diverse effects on expression .
Specificity of EKLF-HAT Interaction .
There are two levels of target specificity by HATs upon EKLF .
First , not all potential lysines are acetylated in EKLF .
Second , not all HAT 's utilize EKLF as substrate .
The inability of P/CAF to acetylate EKLF is not due to limitation of its substrate specificity to histones , as it can acetylate itself , TFIIE $ , and TFIIF ( 35 ) .
Although P/CAF was originally isolated by its interaction with CBP ( 28 ) , these two molecules do not always play the same role together , for example during muscle cell differentiation ( 37 ) and in RAR- , STAT1- , or CREB-dependent transcription ( 38 ) .
In the present case , the ability of P/CAF to interact with , yet not acetylate , EKLF is not a passive event , but instead leads to inhibition of EKLF trans-activation .
This may be functionally significant , as P/CAF levels are altered in terminally Proc .

Analyses of EKLF transactivation of the B-globin promoter .
K562 erythroleukemic cells were transfected with 1 ug of HS2/B/luc reporter and the indicated amounts ( ug ) of expression or vector plasmids , and extracts were processed for luciferase activity .
TSA was added where indicated to a final concentration of 2 wM at the time of transfection .
Multiple experiments were averaged after normalization of luciferase activity to cotransfected growth hormone levels .
The effects of CBP ( 4 ) , p300 ( C ) , and P/CAF ( 1D ) are shown along with a dose-response test of CBP ( B ) .
differentiating tissues ( 28 , 37 ) .
An alternative explanation is that a high level of P/CAF expression simply interferes with EKLEF 's interaction with CBP or p300 .
P/CAF interacts with CBP within the same region as E1A ( 28 ) , and such interference would imply that EKLF interacts there also .
Although we have not directly investigated which regions of EKLF associate with p300/CBP , the interaction must be complex , as GST constructs that contain only the transactivation region ( amino acids 20-291 ) or primarily the zinc finger region ( amino acids 287-376 ) are each suitable substrates for acetylation in vitro .
The putative acetylated lysines 279 and 288 map to the EKLF inhibitory domain , which acts in cis and is the highly basic portion of the trans-activation region ( 19 ) .
These lysines also overlap the nuclear localization signal that is common to EKLF , gut-enriched Kriippel-like factor ( GKLF ) , and lung Kriippel-like factor ( LKLF ) ( 39 ) .
As a consequence , not only is the distance between these two lysines constant in this related family , but the locations of flanking arginines ( amino acid residues 280 , 282 , 283 , 289 ) are also conserved .
Intrigu-ingly , the distance between acetylated lysines in p53 ( K373 and K382 ) is identical to that of EKLF , and this region also contains a conserved arginine residue ( 27 ) .
Although we have not observed any effect of acetylation on EKLF DNA binding in vitro by gel-shift analysis ( unpublished observations ) , such effects may be subtle and not readily apparent when using Biochemistry : Zhang and Bicker GST-EKLF fusions .
Whether acetylation affects nuclear trans-location awaits analysis , as these two processes have not been linked previously .
It is now clear that EKLF undergoes two types of post-translational modifications : phosphorylation and acetylation .
Phosphorylation of Thr-41 within the activation domain is critical for EKLF trans-activation in vivo ( 40 ) .
Unlike the inhibitory domain , the minimal activation domain acts in trans , is acidic , and is located at the amino terminus of the EKLF transactivation region ( 19 ) .
Our present studies show that EKLF activity may also be augmented by acetylation .
Altered levels of EKLF phosphorylation and acetylation may provide two distinct yet overlapping forms of cellular control over its activity during erythroid ontogeny .
If these types of control mechanisms are primarily operative in definitive cells , this may explain how EKLF is required for completion of the definitive erythroid program , even though it is also expressed in primitive erythroid cells ( 29 ) and in multipotent progenitors ( 41 , 42 ) .
Biological Implications of EKLF Acetylation .
HATs have been implicated in maintenance of the open chromatin configuration seen at the B-globin locus , as acetylated histones are preferentially distributed throughout the region in erythroid cells ( 23 ) .
In addition , treatment of erythroid cells with butyrate ( 43 ) or TSA ( 44 ) alters the expression profile of the globin genes within the locus .
The present experiments reveal that HAT 's may exert a second effect on expression within the locus by their ability to acetylate critical erythroid-specific transcription factors such as EKLF and affect their function .
Consistent with this idea , TSA acts as an inducer of globin synthesis in MEL cells ( 45 ) , and conversely , interference ( by E1A repression ) of CBP activity in MEL cells prevents induction of globin expression ( 46 ) .
Our present experiments utilized transient transfection to test for functional effects of HAT 's on EKLF activity .
Although the actual chromatin status of these templates is not known , it is likely to be a loose and disorganized structure ( 47 ) .
In this sense , one may speculate that acetylation of histones is not the dominant cause of EKLF superactivity in transient assays , and that the effect of p300 and CBP on EKLF activity arises from their function as bridging factors and/or as FAT 's .
However , CBP may also be affecting other parts of the transcriptional process , including bridging with and/or modification of other target proteins important for full activity of the B-globin promoter .
Although the functional effects of TFIIERB and TFIIH modification are not known , acetylation of p53 alters its conformation , increasing its DNA-binding affinity ( 27 ) .
Acetylation of histones decreases the affinity of their amino-terminal tails for DNA , altering chromatin structure ( reviewed in ref .
21 ) .
By analogy , EKLF acetylation would be predicted to affect its protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions as a result of neutralizing positively charged lysines .
Given that EKLF is acetylated and that its transcriptional activity is stimulated by CBP/p300 , it is more likely that intra- or intermolecular protein interactions , rather than those with DNA , are affected .
This may result in a cascade of interactions that would explain the requirement of EKLF for formation of DNase-sensitive sites at the adult B-globin promoter and at HS3 ( 17 ) .
For example , EKLF may recruit CBP to the -globin promoter , resulting in modification of the local core histones and of EKLF , which may then be further able to recruit a chromatin remodeling complex that decondenses the area and renders it transcriptionally competent .
In support of such an idea , the ability of EKLF to activate in vitro transcription of a chromatin-repressed B-globin promoter requires a SWI/SNF-like remodeling complex ( J. Armstrong , J.J.B. , and B. Emerson , unpublished results ) .
Indeed , the histone acety-lase ADA/GCNS5 and the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex are thought to act in concert to modify chromatin structure at specific target genes in yeast ( 48 ) .
In addition , Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 95 ( 1998 ) 9859 CBP /p300 interacts with BRG1 , a human homolog of SWI2 ( 49 ) .
Such a coordinate acetylation/remodeling mechanism has been postulated to be involved in the long-distance regulation of the B-like globin cluster ( 50 ) .
Clearly , future experiments will be directed at resolving whether and how EKLF acts as an integrator of these various signals at the adult -globin locus .
