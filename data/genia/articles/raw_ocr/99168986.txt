IMMUNOBIOLOGY Interferon-a « Activates Multiple STAT Proteins and Upregulates Proliferation-Associated IL-2Ra « , c-myc , and pim-1 Genes in Human T Cells By Sampsa Matikainen , Timo Sareneva , Tapani Ronni , Anne Lehtonen , Paivi J. Koskinen , and Ilkka Julkunen Interferon- « ( IFN- « ) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has antiviral , antiproliferative , and immunoregulatory functions .
There is increasing evidence that IFN- « has an important role in T-cell biology .
We have analyzed the expression of /L-2Re , c-myc , and pim-1 genes in anti-CD3-activated human T lymphocytes .
The induction of these genes is associated with interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -induced T-cell proliferation .
Treatment of T lymphocytes with IFN- « , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-15 upregulated /L-2R « , c-myc , and pim-1 gene expression .
IFN- « also sensitized T cells to IL-2-induced proliferation , further suggesting that IFN- « may be involved in the regulation of T-cell mitogenesis .
When we analyzed the nature of STAT proteins capable of binding to L-2RMx , pim-1 , and IRF-1 GAS NTERFERON-a « ( IFN- « ) has antiviral , antiproliferative , and immunomodulatory functions . '' ''
IFN- « is produced in the course of immune response , especially during viral infections .
Macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells are the main cellular sources of IFN- « .
Immunomodulatory functions of IFN-a « include the enhancement of natural killer ( NK ) cell and T-cell cytotoxicity , '' and knockout mice lacking a functional type I IFN receptor were unable to generate a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus .
IFN-a has been shown to promote Th1-type immune responses , eg , by inducing interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) receptor B2 chain and IFN-y gene expression in human T cells . ''
IL-2 is the major growth factor for T lymphocytes .
IL-2 stimulation of T cells is associated with the activation of several signaling pathways , including the Janus tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Jak-STAT ) path-way . ''
Binding of IL-2 to its receptor activates Jak1 and Jak3 tyrosine kinases , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation , dimeriza-tion , and nuclear translocation of STAT5 proteins .
The role of STATS in IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation is controversial , ' > '' but recent studies with STATSa-deficient mice suggest that STAT5a is involved in T-cell proliferation .

0006-4971/99/9306-0022 $ 3.00/0 1980 elements after cytokine stimulation , we observed IFN- « -induced binding of STAT1 , STAT3 , and STATA , but not STATS to all of these elements .
Yet , IFN- « was able to activate binding of STATS to the high-affinity IFP53 GAS site .
IFN- « enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , STAT3 , STAT4 , STATS5a , and STATS5b .
IL-12 induced STAT4 and IL-2 and IL-15 induced STATS binding to the GAS elements .
Taken to-gether , our results suggest that IFN- « , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL~15 have overlapping activities on human T cells .
These findings thus emphasize the importance of IFN- « as a T-cell regulatory cytokine .

to IL-2 , a result of impaired expression of IL-2 receptor a ( IL-2Ra ) chain . ''
IL-2 signals via a specific receptor , the high-affinity form of which is composed of three subunits , « ( CD25 ) , B ( CD122 ) , and `` ¥ ( Vcommon ) Chains .
Whereas the B and y chains are constitutively expressed in resting T lymphocytes , the « chain is expressed only in activated T lymphocytes . ''
Both T-cell receptor stimulation and IL-2 treatment are able to induce a chain gene expression .
IL-2Ra chain is required for the high-affinity binding of IL-2 and it is essential for optimal proliferative responses of the mature T cells .
'* '' '' A human immune disorder , characterized by decreased numbers of peripheral T cells , arises from a mutation in the gene coding for the IL-2Ra « chain . '' ''
IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation is associated with the induction of several IL-2-responsive genes , such as c-myc and pim-1..5 '' The c-myc gene is expressed in a wide variety of proliferating cells , and it is activated in many types of human and animal neoplasia , including leukemias and lymphomas . ''
The pim-1 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells . ' '' '' ''
Studies with transgenic mice have demonstrated that pim- ] can also act as an oncogene in synergy with c-myc , N-myc , or bei-2 to induce B- and T-cell lymphomas. ? ''
In addition , there is evidence that overexpression of pim-1 can accelerate lymphoid and myeloid cell proliferation by enhancing cell survival .
`` * '' '' Both c-Myc and Pim-1 proteins may thus have important roles in mediating cytokine-induced mitogenic signals .
Although IFN-a « is an important T-cell regulatory cytokine , most studies so far regarding IFN- « signaling and gene activation have been performed using nonlymphoid cells .
In this report , we have studied the cytokine-dependent gene expression in anti-CD3-activated human T lymphocytes focusing on genes that are involved in T-cell mitogenesis .
We show that , in addition to IFN- « , also IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-15 induce IL-2Ra , c-myc , and pim-1 gene expression .
We also show that IFN- « induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , STAT3 , STATA , STAT 5a , and STAT 5b and enhances their binding to the IFN-y activated sequence ( GAS ) elements of the IFN-o-responsive genes .

T-cell proliferation assay .
- Anti-CD3-activated T cells were removed from IL-2-containing media before the proliferation assay .
Cell cultures with greater than 90 % viability were used .
A total of 10 % 10° cells ( 10° cells/mL ) were left untreated or treated with IFN-a « for 24 hours .
The cells were then washed twice with PBS , counted , and resuspended into IFN-free RPMI .
Fifty microliters of cell suspension ( 50,000 cells ) was seeded in triplicates into a round-bottom 96-well plate ( Greiner , Niirtingen , Germany ) .
IL-2 was added at a final concentration of 0 , 10 , 30 , or 100 IU/mL .
After thorough mixing , cells were incubated in 5 % CO ; at 37°C for 18 hours .
The cells were incubated for another 6 hours in the presence of 1 uCi/well of `` H-labeled thymidine ( Amersham ) .

The proliferation index was calculated as follows : index = ( IL-2 induced incorporation background incorporation ) /background incorporation .
RESULTS IFN- , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-15 enhance IL-2Ra , c-myc , and pim-1 mRNA expression in human T lymphocytes .
- IFN-a is an important T-cell regulatory cytokine that , eg , enhances T-cell cytotoxicity '' and stimulates T-cell growth . ''
We therefore studied whether IL-2Ra , c-myc , and pim-1 , genes involved in T-cell proliferation previously shown to be induced by IL-2 are also upregulated by IFN- « , IL-12 , and IL-1 5 .
We used activated T cells to ensure that the cells were maximally responsive to cytokine treatment .
T cells were incubated with IFN- « , IL-2 , IL-12 , or IL-15 or with different combinations of these cytokines .
After 3 hours of stimulation , the cells were collected and From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

1982 total cellular RNA was prepared for Northern blot analysis .
IFN- « , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-15 all enhanced IL-2Ra « , c-myc , and pim-1 mRNA expression ( Fig 1A ) .
However , there were certain differences between the cytokines in inducing IL-2Re , c-myc , and pim-1 genes .
IL-2R « was induced by IFN- « , IL-2 , and IL-15 , whereas only a weak induction was seen by IL-12 ( Fig 1A ) .
IFEN- @ , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-1 5 all induced c-myc and pim-I gene expression , with IL-12 having the strongest and IL-2 the weakest effect .
IL-12 combined with IL-2 or IL-15 most strongly enhanced IL-2Ra , c-myc , and pim-1 gene expression .
In addition , IFN-e combined with IL-2 or IL-15 had a synergistic effect on the expression of all genes studied ( Fig 1A ) .
Because IFN- @ , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-15 upregulated IL-2Ra mRNA expression in activated T cells , we also studied IL-2Ra « protein expression by Western blotting .
T cells were stimulated for 24 hours with IFN-a « , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-15 , after which cells were collected and lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis .
As shown in Fig 1B , IL-2Ra was expressed at basal level in activated T cells .
In accordance with mRNA data , IL-15 A Stimulation ( 3 h ) MATIKAINEN ET AL was the strongest and IL-12 the weakest inducer of IL-2Ra « protein expression .
Also , IFN- « and IL-2 clearly upregulated IL-2Ra « protein expression ( Fig 1B ) .
Because IFN- « was able to turn on genes associated with T-cell proliferation , we wanted to study the dose-dependent effect of IFN-a « and IFN- on IL-2Ra , c-myc , and pim-1 gene expression .
Therefore , T cells were treated with different concentrations of IFN-a or IFN- .
Very low doses ( 1 IU/mL ) of IFN-a and IFN- were able to induce IL-2R « , c-myc , and pim- I mRNA expression ( Fig 2 ) , suggesting that the induction takes place with physiologically relevant IFN concentrations .
High expression levels of these genes were detected with 10 IU/mL of both IFN-a « and IFN-f. IFN-a priming enhances IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation .
Because IFN- « was able to enhance IL-2Ra gene expression , we studied whether IFN-a « pretreatment would sensitize T cells to IL-2-induced cell proliferation .
The cells were left untreated or pretreated with IFN- « for 24 hours and restimulated with IL-2 , and the T-cell proliferation was analyzed by *H-labeled thymidine incorporation assay .

This phenomenon was observed with all IL-2 concentrations tested ( Fig 3 ) .
Cytokine-induced STAT DNA-binding to the IL-2Ra GAS-c/ GAS-n element .
- Many cytokines use the Jak/STAT pathway in their signaling and activate genes via GAS elements . ' '' ''
Recently , an essential upstream IL-2 response element of the IL-2Ra gene was characterized .
This region contains a consensus and a nonconsensus GAS motif , both of which are required for IL-2-induced IL-2Ra gene expression .
`` * '' '' To characterize the proteins capable of binding to the GAS-c/GAS-n element ( -3778 to -3740 ) of the IL-2Ra gene , we stimulated T cells with different cytokines , prepared nuclear extracts , and performed EMSA .
EMSAs with the GAS-c/GAS-n oligonucleotide showed the induction of one major complex in response to IFN- « , IL-2 , IL-12 , and IL-15 stimulation ( Fig 4A ) .
However , the mobility of IL-2- and IL-15-induced complexes differed from the ones induced by IFN- « or IL-12 , suggesting that these 1983 cytokines activate a different range of STAT proteins .
The intensity of the IFN-o-induced complex was clearly the stron-gest .
This complex was formed already at 0.5 hours after IFN- « stimulation , and it was detectable at 1 hour after stimulation but disappeared thereafter .
Similarly , IL-2- , IL-12- , and IL-15-induced complexes were detectable only at 0.5 hours and 1 hour after stimulation .
Next , we identified the proteins within these complexes using specific anti-STAT antibodies in supershift experiments .
Antibodies against STAT1 almost completely abolished IFN- « -induced DNA binding to GAS-c/GAS-n .
Surprisingly , the addition of anti-STAT3 and anti-STAT4 antibodies resulted in a clearly detectable supershift ( Fig 4B ) .
The data suggest that IFN-o-induced complexes consist of at least STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 proteins .
IL-12-induced DNA binding complex reacted only with anti-STAT4 antibodies ( Fig 4C ) .
As expected , IL-2 and IL-15 both induced STATS DNA binding to GAS-c/GAS-n as detected by supershift experiments ( Fig 4B and C ) .

- Effect of IFN-a pretreatment on IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation .
T lymphocytes were activated with anti-CD3-antibodies and expanded in the presence of IL-2 , after w hich IL-2-containing medium was removed .
The cells were then left untreated or treated with 100 IU/mL of IFN- « for 24 hours .
The cells were collected , and an equal number of ( C ) ) untreated or ( MI ) IFN- « -primed T cells was applied in microtiter plates .
Different doses of IL-2 were added for 18 hours , followed by further incubation of 6 hours in the presence of 1 pCi/well of H-labeled thymidine .
After harvesting the cells , the proliferation index was determined as described in Materials and Methods .
The mean proliferation index ( +SD ) of six individual donors is show n. IFN-a induces STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 DNA binding to IRF-1 and pim-1 GAS elements .
Analysis of pim-1 gene promoter has shown a functional GAS element that binds STAT1 homodimer in response to IFN-y stimulation . ''
We studied STAT binding to pim-1 GAS in T lymphocytes in response to cytokine stimulation .
EMSA indicated that several STAT complexes were able to bind to pim-1 GAS element ( -934 to -905 ) in response to IFN- « stimulation ( Fig 5A ) .
These complexes were detectable at 0.5 hours after IFN- « treatment and disappeared within 3 hours .
IL-12 induced two different DNA binding complexes when pim-1 GAS was used as a probe ( Fig 5A ) .
Both IL-2 and IL-15 induced three different DNA binding complexes .
Supershift experiments with specific anti-STAT antibodies indicated that IFN- « -induced complexes consisted of STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 ( Fig 5B ) .
The lower-most complex induced by IFN- « supershifted with anti-STAT1 antibody only .
In addition , complexes that supershifted with anti-STAT1 and/or anti-STAT3 antibodies suggested that STAT1-STAT3 heterodimers and STAT3 homodimers were formed after IFN- « stimulation ( Fig 5B ) .
The mobility of IL-12-induced complex was comparable to the uppermost complex seen in IFN-a « -treated T cells .
These complexes supershifted with anti-STAT4 antibodies , suggesting that IFN-a « is also able to induce STAT4 DNA binding .
In addition , the uppermost complex was also supershifted with anti-STAT1 antibody ( Fig 5B ) , suggesting that heterodimers consisting of STAT1 and STAT4 are formed in response to IFN- « stimulation .
Because IRF-1 GAS element binds STATs 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , albeit with different strengths , '' '' we wanted to analyze the T-cell-specific STAT binding to this element .
Again , IFN- « MATIKAINEN ET AL induced the DNA binding of multiple complexes ( Fig 6A ) .
IFEN-a « induced the DNA binding of STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 to IRF-1 GAS ( Fig 6B ) .
IFN-o-induced STAT3 DNA binding to IRF-1 GAS was very weak compared with STAT1 or STAT4 DNA binding , probably due to the low affinity of STAT3 to IRF-1 GAS .
IL-12 induced two complexes , of which the upper complex supershifted with anti-STAT4 antibody only ( data not shown ) .
Both IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation resulted in the formation of only one major DNA binding complex that was detectable at least up to 6 hours ( Fig 6A ) .
This complex was supershifted with anti-STATS5 antibody ( data not shown ) .
IFN- enhances STAT1 , STAT3 , STAT4 , STAT5a , and STATS5b tyrosine phosphorylation in anti-CD3-activated human T lymphocytes .
- Because IFN-a induced STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 DNA binding to GAS elements , we also analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins .
T cells were stimulated with IFN- « or IL-12 , STATs were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies , and their tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting .
In unstimulated cells , STAT1 and STAT3 were weakly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues , but IFN- « strongly enhanced STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig 7A ) .
Both IFN- « and IL-12 strongly enhanced STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig 7A ) .
The blots were stripped of detecting antibody and reprobed for STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 to confirm equal loading of each lane ( lower panel ) .
Because it has previously been shown that IFN-a « activates STAT 5a in promonocytic U937 and STAT 5b in HeLa cells , '' '' we wanted to study whether IFN- « is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS5 also in human T lymphocytes .
T cells were stimulated with IFN- « or IL-2 , and STAT5a and STAT5b immunoprecipitates were analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting .
IFN- « enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT5a and STAT5b ( Fig 7B ) .
IL-2 was a much more potent in inducing STAT5a and STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation than IFN- « .
Again , the blots were reblotted with STAT5a and STATS5b antibodies to determine equal loading ( lower panel ) .
Although we observed IFN-o-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5a and STAT5b , we were not able to detect any clear STAT5 DNA binding to IL-2Ra , pim-1 , or IRF-1 GAS elements .
To further analyze whether IFN-a « is able to activate STAT5 DNA binding in T cells , we performed EMSA with IFP53 GAS element that is known to bind STATS with high affinity . ''
T cells were stimulated with IFN- « and IL-2 for 0.5 hours , and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed in EMSA .
IFN-a « induced both STAT1 and STAT 5 DNA binding to IFP53 GAS , whereas IL-2 was able to induce the DNA binding of STATS ( Fig 8 ) .
IFN- priming enhances IL-2-induced STAT1 and STATS3 DNA binding .
Because IFN- priming enhanced IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation ( Fig 3 ) , we studied whether IFN- « has any effect on IL-2-induced STAT DNA binding .
T cells were left untreated or treated with IFN- for 24 hours , followed by stimulation with different concentrations of IL-2 ( 0 , 3 , 10 , or 30 IU/mL ) for 30 minutes .
In unprimed T cells , IL-2 induced one major and one minor IRF-1 GAS binding complex .
In IFN-o-primed , IL-2-stimulated cells , IRF-1 GAS DNA binding was markedly enhanced .

STAT1 antibody ( Fig 9 ) .
The data suggest that in T cells IL-2 can activate STAT1 and that the IFN-o pretreatment strongly enhances IL-2-induced STAT 1 ( and STAT5 ) DNA binding ( Fig 9 ) .
Enhanced STAT1 and STATS complex formation in primed T cells in response to IL-2 stimulation was also detected when pim-1 GAS was used as a probe in EMSA ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , IFN- « did not enhance IL-2-induced STAT5 DNA binding to IL-2R « GAS-c/GAS-n ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The gene knock-out studies have shown that a functional IFN- « /B system is essential for the clearance of viral infec-tion .
* '' '' '' It is also well accepted that IFN-a « can directly inhibit proliferation of normal and tumor cells in vitro and in vivo . ''
However , there is some evidence that IFN- « would enhance T-cell growth .
Tough et al '' have shown that IFN-o-stimulated CD8 * cells proliferate and survive in vivo for longer periods of time than their unstimulated counterparts .
In the present study , we demonstrate that IFN- « priming can augment IL-2-induced human T-cell proliferation in vitro , and this phenomenon was associated with the induction of IL-2Ra , c-myc , and pim-1 gene expression .
Especially , IFN-o-induced upregulation of IL-2Ra expression could directly contribute to enhanced responsiveness of T cells to IL-2 .
Enhanced pim-1 gene expression may also contribute to increased T-cell survival .
There is evidence that overexpression of pim-1 can accelerate lymphoproliferation by inhibiting Recent results from studies on cytokine-mediated signaling suggest that pim-1 expression correlates with the viability , but not with the proliferation potential of the cells.4 > 3 Not only IFN- « and IL-2 , but also IL-12 and IL-15 as well induced the expression of the gene in anti-CD3-activated T lymphocytes .
Induction of IL-2Ra gene expression by IL-15 was expected , because IL-15 also activates STATS and uses B and y chains of the IL-2 receptor during downstream From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

However , the finding that IFN- « and IL-12 induced the upregulation of ZL-2Ra « gene expression was more surpris-ing .
An IL-2-responsive element in the IL-2Ra gene promoter has recently been characterized .
`` * '' '' This element binds at least STAT5 , Elf-1 , HMG-I ( Y ) , and GATA family transcription factors .
The STATS binding site consists of two adjacent GAS elements , a consensus GAS ( GAS-c ) and a nonconsensus one ( GAS-n ) , which are well-conserved in human and mouse promoters .
Single GAS elements of ZIL-2Ra promoter appear to function only as low-affinity STATS binding sites and therefore both of these elements are required for IL-2-induced STATS binding . ''
Previously , cooperative binding of STAT complexes to weak STAT binding sites has been observed , eg , in the first intron of IFN-y* gene and in the promoter of mig chemokine Hb - antibody MATIKAINEN ET AL IL-15 1 3 605 |i 3 6 05 1 3 6 05 i 3 6° time O-II Fig 5 .

In our experiments , by using nuclear extracts from cytokine-stimulated T cells , we were able to detect not only IL-2- and IL-15-induced STATS5 binding , but also IL-12-induced STAT4 binding to the IL-2Ra « GAS-c/GAS-n element .
More interestingly , the IFN-o-induced complexes consisted of STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 proteins , suggesting similar cooperative STAT binding mechanisms as described for the other genes mentioned above . '' ''
The expression of c-myc and pim-1 genes was induced in human T cells by IL-2 , which is the primary growth factor of mature T cells .

The experiment was repeated three times with similar results .
toss IFN- « - and IL-12-activated STAT proteins are involved in the upregulation of pim- I gene expression .
Indeed , we were able to demonstrate that IFN- « induced STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT4 DNA binding to pim-1 GAS .
Similarly , IL-12 induced STAT4 binding to GAS .
In addition , it has been shown that IL-12 upregulates c-myc gene expression in NK and T cells . '' ''
It is also known that Jak3 tyrosine kinase is essential for IL-2-induced expression of c-myc gene , '' '' but there is little information about downstream signal transducing molecules and no evidence of STAT protein involvement .
Further analyses of the molecular mechanisms of IFN-o- , IL-2- , and IL-12-induced c-myc gene expression are clearly needed .
Previously , IFN- « was observed to be able to specifically activate IFN-stimulated gene factor complex ( STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 heterotrimer ) . '' ''

IFN-o-induced STAT3 activation takes place in certain cell types , '' '' '' ' and this has been suggested to be due to a direct phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between IFNAR-1 and the SH2 domain of STAT3 . ''
Whether similar interactions between STAT4 or STATS with the type I IFN receptor exist remains to be studied .
Previously , it was demonstrated that both IL-12 and IFN- « were able to activate DNA binding of STAT4 to FeyRIZ GAS in T lymphocytes . ''
In the present study , we clearly demonstrate that in our T-cell system both IFN- « and IL-12 can induce STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent binding of STAT4 to IRF-1 and pim-1 GAS elements .
This is consistent with the Northern blot data that demonstrated that pim-I ( Fig 1 ) as well as IRF-1 ( data not shown ) genes were upregulated by IFN-and IL-12 .

IFN-o-induced STATS5a and STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation was much weaker compared with IL-2 induction , and no clear IFN- « -induced STAT5 DNA binding to IRF-1 , pim-1 , or IL-2Roe GAS elements was detected .
However , IFN- « induced STAT5 DNA binding to IFP53 GAS element , which is known to bind STATS with high affinity . '' ''
This may suggest that IFN- « -induced STATS activation has physiological significance in the activation of genes that contain high-affinity STATS binding sites .
Because IFN- « was able to enhance IL-2Ra « gene expression and T-cell proliferation , we studied the role of IFN- « in IL-2-induced STAT activation .
Pretreatment of T cells with IFN- « resulted in a twofold to threefold increase in IL-2-induced STAT5 DNA binding , which may contribute to the enhanced T-cell proliferation .
In IFN-o-pretreated T cells , IL-2-induced STAT1 DNA binding was strongly enhanced ( Fig 9 ) .
This could be due to the upregulation of intracellular STAT1 levels or , alternatively , to enhanced IL-2-induced signaling in IFN- « pretreated cells .
The former possibility may be the more likely one , because IFN- « strongly enhances STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 mRNA and protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in human macrophages '' as well as in T lymphocytes ( data not shown ) .
However , STAT 1 was expressed in relatively high levels in T cells and it is possible that other mechanisms , such as STAT1 tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation by IFN- « , may also explain enhanced IL-2-induced STAT1 DNA binding in IFN-o-primed T cells .
IFN- « was first described as a substance inhibiting virus growth in infected cells . ''
Thereafter , much of the research work focused on the antiviral and antiproliferative properties of IFN- « , and its role as an important T-cell regulatory molecule was neglected . ''
In the present study , we provide evidence that IFN- « /fB is able to activate the expression of ZL-2R « , c-myc , and pim-1 genes that are involved in T-cell proliferation or survival .
Pretreatment of activated T cells with also enhanced IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation , suggesting that , in T cells , IFN- « is rather growth stimulatory than inhibitory .
In addition , in T cells , IFN- « was able to activate STAT4 and STAT5 , the signaling molecules used by IL-12 and IL-2 , respectively , which further emphasizes the role of IFN- @ /B as important molecules in T-cell biology .

Over the next 3 weeks she had a waxing and waning course but finally required hospital admission due to worsening pancytopenia ( WBC , 300/ pL ; hematocrit , 16.2 % ; and platelet count , 44,000 , gL ) and hepatic dysfunction ( ALT , 636 U/ L ; AST , 608 U/L ; LDH , 2,788 U/L ; direct bilirubin , 32.2 mg/dL ; and prothrombin time , 16 seconds ) .
Her physical exam was notable for a fever ( 39.5°C ) , a diffuse fine scaly rash , severe icterus , no adenopathy , a liver span of 14 cm in the midclavicular line , and a spleen tip palpable 2 cm below the costal margin .
Biopsy of her bone marrow showed overall hypocellularity with multiple nests of RBCs ( arrow s in figure on left ; original magnification x100 ) .
These nests of RBCs , as seen in the bone marrow aspirate ( figure on right ; original magnification x2,500 ) , represent histiocytes with engulfed erythrocytes characteristic of hemophagocytosis .
Despite intense im munosuppressive therapy ( including steroids , cyclosporin A , IVIG , and ATG ) , she developed respiratory failure , gastrointestinal bleeding , renal failure ( requiring dialysis ) , cardiac dysfunction ( with global hypokinesis ) , and pancreatitis .
She finally succumbed to an intracranial hemorrhage .
Virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome is typically associated with acute EBV infection .
It is characterized by constitutional symptoms , including fever , rash , lymphadenopathy , and hepatospleno-megaly .
Therapy is directed at the immune dysregulation and is often ineffective , as in this unfortunate case .
