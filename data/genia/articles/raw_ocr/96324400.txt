London WC2A 3PX , UK 'Corresponding author The transcription factor , Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells ( NFAT ) is a major target for p21ras and calcium signalling pathways in the IL-2 gene and is induced by p2lras signals acting in synergy with calcium/ calcineurin signals .
One p2lras effector pathway involves the MAP kinase ERK-2 , and we have examined its role in NFAT regulation .
Expression of dominant negative MAPKK-1 prevents NFAT induction .
Constitutively active MAPKK-1 fully activates ERK-2 and the transcription factor Elk-1 , but does not substitute for activated p2lras and synergize with calcium/ calcineurin signals to induce NFAT .
Expression of dominant negative N17Rac also prevents TCR and p2lras activation of NFAT , but without interfering with the ERK-2 pathway .
The transcriptional activity of the NFAT binding site is mediated by a complex comprising a member of the NFAT group and AP-1 family proteins .
The induction of AP-1 by p21ras also requires Rac-1 function .
Activated Rac-1 could mimic activated p2lras to induce AP-1 but not to induce NFAT .
Moreover , the combination of activated MAPKK-1 and Rac-1 could not substitute for activated p2lras and synergize with calcium signals to induce NFAT .
Thus , p2lras regulation of NFAT in T cells requires the activity of multiple effector pathways including those regulated by MAPKK-1/ERK-2 and Rac-1 .
Keywords : NFAT/Rac-1/Ras/MAPKK-1/transduction/ TCR Introduction The T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) controls activation and the GO-G1 transition of T lymphocytes and regulates the production of a number of cytokines , including the growth factor interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .
The regulation of IL-2 production by the TCR requires the co-ordinate action of multiple transcription factors that include Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells ( NFAT ) , AP-1 , NF-xB and Oct- !
( Schreiber and Crabtree , 1992 ; Rao , 1994 ) .
The intracellular signals that regulate these different transcription factors involve tyrosine - kinase-induced - calcium/calcineurin , - protein kinase C ( PKC ) and p21ras-mediated signalling pathways ( Weiss and Littman , 1994 ; Izquierdo-Pastor et al. , 1995 ) .
Inhibition of p21ras function in T cells by expression of a dominant negative p2lras mutant prevents induction of © Oxford University Press the IL-2 gene ( Baldari et al. , 1992 ; Rayter et al. , 1992 ) .
The major target in the IL-2 gene for p2lras signalling pathways is NFAT ( Woodrow et al. , 1993b ) .
Thus , a constitutively active Ras mutant ( p21-v-Ha-ras ) , when expressed in T cells , can synergize with a calcium/ calcineurin - signalling pathway to activate NFAT ( Woodrow et al. , 1993a , b ) .
p21ras regulatory effects on NFAT can be mimicked by phorbol esters that activate PKC or by expression of constitutively activated mutants of PKC ( Genot et al. , 1995 ) .
The ability of phorbol esters to activate p21ras in T cells led to the proposal that PKC effects on NFAT were mediated by p21ras .
However , it is now recognized that phorbol ester and p21ras induction of NFAT occur by different , independent mechanisms .
In particular , p2lras but not PKC signals are essential for TCR induction of NFAT ( Williams et al. , 1995 ) .
NFAT proteins are cytosolic in quiescent T cells but they trans-locate to the nucleus in TCR-activated cells and combine with newly induced AP-1 complexes to form a functional transcriptional factor unit ( Flanagan et al. , 1991 ) .
There are multiple isoforms of the NFAT cytosolic subunit , NFATc , NFATp , NFAT3 and NFAT4 , that have different patterns of cellular expression but are thought to share one property in that their nuclear translocation is controlled by calcium/calcineurin-dependent signals ( Northrop et al. , 1994 ; Rao , 1994 ; Hoey et al. , 1995 ) .
The different NFAT proteins also share the ability to interact with AP-1 to bind co-operatively to the composite NFAT/AP-1 site in the IL-2 gene ( Rao , 1994 ) .
The interaction with AP-1 is essential for NFAT transcriptional activity , and the role of p2lras in NFAT induction has been explained by the ability of p2lras signals to stimulate AP-1 activity in T cells ( Rayter et al. , 1992 ; Woodrow et al. , 1993a ) .
However , the p2lras effector pathways involved in NFAT regulation have not been defined and are the focus of the present report .
T lymphocytes express at least two MAP kinases , ERK-1 and ERK-2 , that are stimulated by a p21lras pathway in response to TCR triggering ( Izquierdo et al. , 1993 ) .
The MAP kinases are activated by a kinase cascade involving a MAP kinase kinase ( MAPKK ) that phos-phorylates and stimulates the ERK-1 and -2 kinases directly ( Marshall , 1994 ; Cobb and Goldsmith , 1995 ) .
The activity of the MAPKK is itself controlled by phosphorylation and , hence , a MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAPKKK ) regulates ERK-1 and -2 .
Raf-1 is a p21lras effector that appears to be the MAPKKK that couples p2lras and hence receptors to the MAP kinases ( Howe et al. , 1992 ; Warne et al. , 1993 ; Izquierdo et al. , 1994a ; Leevers et al. , 1994 ) .
In neuronal cells , MAPKK-1 and ERK-1 , -2 are critical mediators of p2Iras functions ( Cowley et a/. , 1994 ) .
One regulatory substrate for the ERKs is the protein Elk-1 , which is one of a family of proteins that can form a ternary complex with the transcriptional activator serum 3923 E.Genot et al .
response factor ( SRF ) ( Marais et al. , 1993 ) .
Elk-1-SRF complexes are necessary and sufficient mediators of c-fos serum response element induction .
Thus , p21ras regulation of the MAPKK/ERK pathway plays a key role in regulating c-fos gene expression ( Hill and Treisman , 1995 ) .
The analysis of the role of the ERKs in the control of gene expression in fibroblasts has created a paradigm that the MAPKK/ERK pathway is a major route whereby p2lras regulates the transcriptional activity of immediate early genes such as c-fos .
By analogy , there is the possibility that the p21ras/MAPKK pathway is the p21ras effector pathway for NFAT induction .
There has been one previous study on the role of MAPKK and the ERKs as p21 ras effectors in T cells : this was a study in transgenic mice that showed that expression of a dominant negative MAPKK-1 mutant could mimic inhibitory p21ras mutants and suppress positive selection of thymocytes ( Alberola-lla et a/. , 1995 ) .
However , dominant negative Ras mutants can prevent the in vitro proliferation of thymocytes , whereas a dominant negative MAPKK-1 mutant does not , indicating that not all Ras functions in T cells are mediated by the MAP kinases cascade .
The Ras-related GTPase Rac-1 has been described recently as another downstream effector of p21ras ( Hall , 1994 ; Qiu et al. , 1995 ) Accordingly , the object of the present study was to explore the signalling connections between p21ras , the MAPKK/ERK cascade and Rac-1 in T cells in order to determine the role of these proteins in p2 1ras regulation of NFAT .
The data show that expression of a dominant negative MAPKK-1 mutant can inhibit NFAT induction , but expression of a constitutively active MAPKK-1 mutant , which could activate ERK-2 in T cells , could not substitute for constitutively active p21lras and synergize with calcium-dependent signals to induce NFAT .
These studies collectively suggest that the ERK pathway is a necessary but not sufficient p2lras effector pathway for NFAT induction in T cells .
Expression of a dominant negative Rac-1 mutant had a pronounced inhibitory effect on Ras induction of NFAT , which suggests that Rac-1 is an effector for p21ras in NFAT regulation .
In fibroblasts , Rac-1 -mediated intracellular signals participate in activation of Jun kinases and transactivation of c-jun in a mechanism analogous to p2lras regulation of ERK-2-Elk-1 ( Minden et al. , 1995 ) .
The present data show that expression of constitutively active Rac-1 can stimulate AP-1 transcriptional activity in T cells , demonstrating that Rac-1 can also stimulate transcription factor pathways in T cells .
However , constitutively active Rac-l mutants could not synergize with calcium signals to induce NFAT , indicating that Rac-1 is necessary but not sufficient for all p21 ras-mediated signalling pathways in T cells .
Accordingly , p2iras effects on NFAT are not mediated by a single linear signalling pathway but must involve multiple effectors that include Rac-i and MAPKK-1 .
Results The effects of inhibitory and active MAPKK-1 mutants on NFAT induction Activation of p2lras in T cells can be prevented by expression of an inhibitory mutant of p2lras , Nl7Ras ( Izquierdo et al. , 1993 ) .
Expression of N17Ras in T cells also suppresses TCR activation of the MAP kinases ERK-1 3924 and -2 , which correlates with the inhibitory effects of N17Ras on TCR activation of NFAT ( Izquierdo et al. , 1993 ; Woodrow et al. , 1993b ) .
The MAP kinases ERK-1 and -2 are activated by a kinase ( MAPKK ) that phosphoryl-ates and stimulates the ERK-1 and -2 kinases directly .
MAPKK is activated by protein phosphorylation , and mutation of phosphorylation sites at position 217 and/or 221 on MAPKK-1 from serine to alanine generates an inhibitory molecule that can suppress growth factor-mediated activation of the ERK kinase cascade ( Cowley et al. , 1994 ) .
Accordingly , in initial experiments to explore whether regulation of ERKs explains p2lras control of NFAT , the effects of the inhibitory mutant of MAPKK 221A ( DN MAPKK ) on TCR regulation of NFAT were analysed .
To assess the activity of the transcription factor NFAT , we employed transient transfection protocols and quantitation of the expression of a CAT reporter gene whose activity is regulated by an enhancer corresponding to the NFAT binding site .
The data in Figure 1A show that this NFAT reporter gene is not expressed in unstimulated Jurkat cells but is induced in cells stimulated with the antibody UCHT-1 that triggers the TCR-CD3 complex .
TCR induction of NFAT can be mimicked by the combination of stimuli that activate PKC and elevate intracellular calcium levels such as phorbol esters and calcium iono-phores .
PKC and p21ras independently induce NFAT and similarly independently activate ERK-2 ( Izquierdo et a/. , 1993 ; Williams et a/. , 1995 ) .
There is thus the possibility that PKC and Ras signals for NFAT induction converge at the level of the MAP kinases .
The data in Figure 1A show that the phorbol ester phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate ( Pdbu ) has no stimulatory effect on NFAT when used as a single stimulus , and the calcium ionophore ionomycin has only a weak inductive effect on NFAT .
However , the combination of calcium ionophore and Pdbu synergizes to give maximal NFAT activity .
Expression of the inhibitory MAPKK-1 mutant in T cells inhibits TCR induction of NFAT and also suppresses Pdbu and ionomycin induction of NFAT ( Figure 1A ) .
In four experiments , the inhibitory effect of the dominant negative MAPKK mutant on the TCR/NFAT response ranged from 77 to 50 % , whereas the inhibitory effects of this mutant on Pdbu plus ionomycin responses ranged from 30 to 40 % .
To monitor ERK activation in cells transfected with the dominant negative MAPKK-1 mutant , the inhibitory mutant was co-expressed in T cells with ERK-2tag , an epitope-tagged ERK-2 construct .
Activated ERK-2 is phosphorylated and , as we have shown previously , activated ERK-2tag isolated from Pdbu- or TCR-activated T cells has reduced electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE gels as compared with ERK-2tag isolated from quiescent cells ( Izquierdo et a/. , 1994a , b ) ( Figure 1B ) .
Accordingly , the activation of ERK-2tag can be monitored sensitively by analysis of its electrophoretic mobility .
The data in Figure 1B show that co-transfecting the dominant negative MAPKK-1 mutant with ERK-2tag prevents ERK-2tag phosphorylation as induced by either TCR or phorbol ester .
In further experiments , we examined the consequences of expressing a constitutively activated MAPKK-1 mutant on NFAT induction .
Mutation of residues 217 and 221 on MAPKK-1 from serine to glutamic acid generates a constitutively active enzyme , MAPKK-1 217E/221E ( MAPKK* ) .

Results from one experiment representative of five are presented .
MAPKK-1 will activate the MAP kinases ERK-1 and -2 and has been shown to substitute for activated p2lras in many cellular responses in fibroblasts and neuronal cells ( Cowley et al. , 1994 ) .
The data in Figure 1C are representative of five similar experiments and show that NFAT responses were only marginally induced by the activated MAPKK-1 mutant in combination with ionomycin .
No further induction of the NFAT-CAT reporter construct could be seen by increasing or decreasing the amount of activated MAPKK-1 DNA transfected ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , the constitutively active Ras mutant , v-Ha-ras , which has no effect on NFAT alone , synergizes strongly with ionomycin for NFAT induction .
The data in Figure 1C thus show that the activated MAPKK-1 mutant does not mimic activated p21ras for NFAT induction .
To ensure that the failure of the active MAPKK-1 217E/ 221E mutant to regulate NFAT in T cells did not reflect the inability of MAPKK-1 to stimulate the ERKs , experiments to monitor ERK-2 activity in cells expressing the activated MAPKK-1 mutant were performed .
In initial experiments , the activated MAPKK-1 mutant was co-expressed in T cells with ERK-2tag .
The data in Figure 2A show that ERK-2tag isolated from T cells co-transfected with activated MAPKK-1 mutant has a reduced mobility in SDS-PAGE similarly to the ERK-2 isolated from activated T cells .
To confirm that this mobility shift of ERK-2tag correlates with activation of the enzyme and to demonstrate that the activated MAPKK-1 could stimulate ERK-2 activity , kinase assays using myelin basic protein ( MBP ) as a substrate were carried out on ERK-2tag immunoprecipitates isolated from activated MAPKK-1 or control transfected cells .
We have used this system previously to demonstrate that expression of activated p21lras in T cells is sufficient to stimulate ERK-2 kinase activity ( Izquierdo et al. , 1993 ) .
TCR induction of ERK-2 is transient and peaks at 10-15 min post-stimulation .
In the experiment presented in Figure 2B , it is this peak TCR response that is shown , whereas in the transient transfection experiments the sustained effects of either activated p2Ilras or MAPKK-1 mutants on ERK-2 are monitored .
Expression of activated MAPKK-1 mutant induced an ~5-fold increase in ERK-2 kinase activity in T cells .
The activated p21ras induction of ERK-2 activity is 50 % of the maximal response induced by the TCR , which is consistent with our previous quantitation of ERK-2 activity in T cells expressing activated p21ras ( Izquierdo et al. , 1993 ) .
The increase in ERK-2 activity in cells expressing activated MAPKK-1 mutant was to a level which is equivalent to the effects of activated p21ras on ERK-2 activity ( Figure 2B ) .
The effector function of the transfected activated MAPKK-1 mutant on the endogenous ERK in Jurkat cells was also examined by assessing its ability to regulate phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 , which is a cellular substrate for ERK-2 ( Marais et al. , 1993 ) .
Elk-1 is one of a family of proteins that can form a ternary complex with the transcriptional activator SRF and thus can play a key role in regulation of c-fos gene expression 3925 E.Genot et al .

The activated MAPKK mutant is able to activate ERK .
( A ) Jurkat cells were co-transfected with the pEF-BOS ERK-2tag construct ( 12.5 ug ) together with the empty vector , or with the activated MAPKK-1 mutant ( 12.5 ug of pEXV ; , MAPKK 217E/221E ) or the wild-type MAPKK-1 ( 12.5 ug pEXV ; MAPKK wt ) .
At 16 h post-transfection , cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with Pdbu 50 ng/ml for 10 min .
Total cellular extracts were made and run on SDS-PAGE .
Data show Western blot analysis of ERK-2tag with the 9E10 antibody .
( B ) Jurkat cells were co-transfected with the pEF BOS ERK-2tag construct ( 15 ug ) together with 25 ug of the empty vector or with the activated Ras ( 25 ug of pEXV ; v-Ha-ras ) or MAPKK-1 ( 25 ug of pEXV ; MAPKK 217E/221E ) mutants .
At 16 h post-transfection , cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated with UCHT-1 ( 10 ug/ml ) for 10 min .
Cells were lysed , the ERK-2tag was immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 antibody and kinase activity was assessed in a kinase assay using MBP as substrate .
Radioactivity incorporated into MBP was quantified with the phosphoimager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Data show the MBP kinase activity in ERK-2tag precipitates presented as a percentage of the maximal response obtained by TCR stimulation .
( C ) Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 15 ug of the plasmid encoding the fusion protein , pEF N Lex-Elk-1C , together with 20 ug of the empty vector or with the activated Ras ( 20 ug of pEXV ; v-Ha-ras ) or MAPKK-1 ( 20 ug of pEXV ; , MAPKK 217E/221E ) mutants .
At 16 h post-transfection , cells were transfected with the empty vector and were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with UCHT-1 ( 10 ug/ml ) or Pdbu ( 50 ng/ml ) for 30 min .
Total cell extracts were made and run on SDS-PAGE .
Data show Western blot analysis of Lex A-Elk-1C with LexA antibodies .
( Hill and Treisman , 1995 ) .
It has been shown previously that activators of the ERK kinase cascade can induce phosphorylation of the Elk-1 C-terminus and potentiate Elk-1 transcriptional activity ( Price et al. , 1995b ) .
To monitor this phosphorylation , a fusion protein comprising the C-terminus of Elk-1 linked to the LexA repressor ( LexA-Elk-1C ) was co-transfected into T cells with activated p2lras or MAPKK-L mutants .
The phosphorylation of LexA-Elk-1C reduces its electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE gels .
Accordingly , the data in Figure 2C show the reduced electrophoretic mobility of LexA-Elk-1 in Pdbu- or TCR-activated cells compared with control unstimulated cells .
LexA-Elk-1C isolated from T cells expressing either activated p21ras or activated MAPKK-1 mutant has a similar reduced electrophoretic mobility ( Figure 2C ) .
The activated MAPKK and activated p21ras had equivalent stimulatory effects on the transcriptional activity of Elk-1 ( data not shown ) .
In summary , the data in Figures 1 and 2 show that expression of a dominant negative mutant of MAPKK-1 suppresses TCR induction of NFAT .
The data demonstrate also that expression of an activated MAPKK-1 mutant in T cells is sufficient for ERK-2 activation and sufficient for phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 .
However , expression of a constitutively active MAPKK-1 mutant is not sufficient to substitute for p2 Iras for NFAT induction .
Accordingly , to explain p2lras regulation of NFAT in T cells , it is necessary to invoke the existence of alternative Ras effector pathways .
The effects of inhibitory and activated mutants of Rac-1 on NFAT induction The Ras-related GTPase Rac-1 has been identified as a downstream effector of p2 1ras in fibroblast transformation 3926 ( Qiu et al. , 1995 ) .
The role of Rac-1 in NFAT regulation in T cells was explored by monitoring the effects of a dominant negative Rac-1 mutant , Nl7Rac , and a constitutively active Rac-1 mutant , V12Rac ( Rac* ) ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) .
The data in Figure 3A show that expression of the dominant negative N17Rac molecule inhibits NFAT induction by the TCR and also , although to a lesser extent , suppresses the NFAT response induced by phorbol ester and calcium ionophore .
In an experiment that investigated the N17Rac dose dependency of NFAT induction , it appeared that Pdbu and ionomycin induction of NFAT comprised an Nl7Rac-sensitive and -insensitive component ( Figure 3B ) .
To examine the selectivity of the effects of the dominant negative mutant of Rac-1 on TCR signalling , the effects of Nl7Rac-1 on TCR and Pdbu activation of ERK-2 were determined .
Accordingly , T cells were transfected with ERK-2tag either alone or together with N17Rac .
The data in Figure 3C show that TCR or Pdbu stimulation or transfection of activated p2lras induces ERK-2 activation while expression of activated Rac mutant has no effect on ERK-2 activity .
Co-expressing N17Rac in these cells did not affect p21ras , TCR or Pdbu activation of ERK-2 , showing that the inhibitory effects of N17Rac did not result from inhibition of ERK-2 ( Figure 3C ) .
To explore further the role of Rac-1 in NFAT regulation , the effects of an activated Rac-l mutant ( V12Rac ) on transcription factor activity were compared with the effects of the activated mutant .
p21lras can regulate the transcription factor AP-1 activity in a variety of cells including T cells ( Rayter et al. , 1992 ; Woodrow et al. , 1993b ) .
To compare p2lras and Rac-1 regulation of the activity of AP-1 , we quantified the expression of an AP-1-CAT reporter gene .

by Pdbu , TCR triggering with UCHT1l antibodies and constitutively active p2lras protein ( Figure 4A ) .
AP-1 activity is also induced by the activated Rac-1 mutant ( Figure 4A ) .
Further experiments demonstrate that TCR and Pdbu induction of AP-1 activity in T cells are prevented by expression of the dominant negative Rac-1 mutant N1l7Rac ( Figure 4B ) .
These data show that Rac-1 activity is essential for TCR and Ras regulation of AP-1 in T cells .
Moreover , expression of constitutively activated Rac-1 is sufficient to stimulate levels of AP-1 activity comparable with that seen in cells expressing activated p2lras mutants ( Figure 4A ) .
To compare p21lras and MAPKK-1 regulation of the activity of AP-1 , we quantified the expression of the AP-I-CAT reporter gene in cells expressing either constitutively active p2lras protein or activated MAPKK-1 .
The data in Figure 4C show that AP-1-CAT is not induced by expression of activated MAPKK-1 mutant in T cells .
Since AP-1 is a component of the active NFAT complex in T cells , we also assessed the effects of activated Rac-1 on NFAT responses in T cells .
The data in Figure 5A show that activated Rac-1 could not mimic activated p2lras and synergize with calcium signals for NFAT induction .
No NFAT induction could be seen when using the activated Rac mutant , in conditions for which activated Ras was effective ( Figure 5B ) and under conditions where activated Rac- ! 1 could induce AP-1 .
Given that neither expression of activated MAPKK-1 nor activated Rac-l substitute for p21ras for NFAT , we investigated the possibility of a synergy between MAPKK-1 and Rac-1 .
Data presented in Figure 5C show that the combination of activated Rac-1 and activated MAPKK could not synergize with calcium signals to induce NFAT .
No further induction of the NFAT-CAT reporter construct could be seen when transfecting different ratios of the two plasmids ( data not shown ) .
The data in Figures 1-5 collectively show that MAPKK-1 and Rac-1 function are each important but not sufficient , neither alone nor in combination , for TCR and p2lras regulation of NFAT .
p21ras regulation of NFAT and AP-1 in T cells requires Rac-1 function To position Rac-1 in p2lras signalling pathways , the effect of the dominant negative Rac-1 mutants on signals generated by the constitutively active p2lras mutant were monitored .
Expression of N1l7Rac-l did not prevent expression of the constitutively active p21lras mutant in T cells ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , activated Rac-1 did not induce activation of ERK-2 ( Figure 3C ) , nor did expression of N17Rac prevent p2lras- or Pdbu-mediated activation of ERK-2 ( Figure 3C ) .
Results presented in Figure 6A show that expression of Nl7Rac did not prevent p2lras-mediated phosphorylation of Elk-1 , which is consistent with the failure of the dominant negative Rac-1 to prevent p2ras-mediated activation of the ERK-2 pathway ( Figure 3C ) .
Activators of the ERK kinase cascade can induce transcriptional activation by the Elk-1 C-terminus ( Price et al. , 1995b ; Hill and Treisman , 1995 ) To monitor Elk-1 transcriptional activity , LexA-Elk-1C was co-transfected into T cells with a Lex A operator-controlled CAT reporter 3927 E.Genot et al .

In contrast , in the same experiment , Nl7Rac inhibits the AP-1 response induced by the constitutively active p2lras ( Figure 6C ) and also prevents NFAT induction induced by activated p2 1ras plus calcium ionophore ( Figure 6D ) .
These data thus indicate that Rac-1 function is required for p21lras induction of AP-1 and NFAT but Rac-1 function is not necessary for p21lras activation of ERK-2 and Elk-1 .
Expression of activated Rac-1 did not activate ERK-2 in T cells ( Figure 3C ) nor was Rac-1 function necessary for TCR- and p2lras-mediated stimulation of ERK-2 ( Figure 3C ) .
Nevertheless , it has been described that Rac-1 plays a role in AP-1 regulation via control of Jun kinases such as JNK/SAPK .
Elk-1 has also been described to be a substrate for the JNK/SAPK family ( Whitmarsh et al. , 1995 ; Zinck et al. , 1995 ) , and to explore if Rac-1 could regulate transcription factor phosphorylation in T cells , 3928 we examined the effects of activated Rac-1 on LexA-Elk-1C phosphorylation .
The data in Figure 6A show that expression of V 12Rac-1 in T cells induced phosphorylation of Lex A-Elk-1C comparable with that induced by activated p2lras .
Rac-1 function is not required for p2lras induction of Elk-1 ( Figure 6A and B ) which is mediated via ERK-2 .
Nevertheless , these results indicate that , in T cells , Rac-1 has the potential to regulate a kinase cascade that can converge with the ERK-2 pathway on the transcription factor Elk-1 .
Discussion The MAP kinase ERK-2 has been proposed to be a major effector of the p21ras signal transduction pathways in a variety of cell systems including the differentiation of PC12 cells and the transformation of fibroblasts .
The present study has used constitutively active and inhibitory mutants of a MAP kinase kinase ( MAPKK-1 ) to examine the role of this pathway in TCR signal transduction .

ation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 , demonstrating that MAPKK-1 is an effector molecule in the regulation of the transcription factor Elk-1 in T cells as in fibroblasts ( Hill and Treisman , 1995 ) .
The transcription factor NFAT is controlled by the TCR by a mechanism involving a synergistic interaction of p21lras and calcium signals .
Experiments using an inhibitory MAPKK-1 mutant indicate that the activation of the MAPKK-1/ERK-1 , -2 cascade plays a role in TCR activation of NFAT because TCR stimulation of NFAT was prevented by the inhibitory form of MAPKK-1 .
However , activated MAPKK-1 could not substitute for p2 l ras signals and synergize with calcium signals to stimulate NFAT .
A comparison of the effects of inhibitory p2lras or MAPKK-1 mutants on thymocyte development in transgenic mice concluded recently that p21lras functions in T cells can not be mediated solely by the ERK-2 signalling cascade ( Alberola-lla et al. , 1995 ; Swan et al. , 1995 ) .
The failure of the activated MAPKK-1 to substitute for activated p2lras in NFAT induction confirms this idea and thus clearly demonstrates that additional p21ras effector pathways must exist in T cells .
Recently , the p21ras-related GTPase Rac-1 has been found to be an important mediator of oncogenic transformation by Ras ( Qiu et al. , 1995 ) .
Here we describe a role for Rac-1 in transcription factor regulation in T cells .
A dominant negative mutant of Rac-1 did not suppress TCR or p2lras activation of the MAP kinase ERK-2 but could suppress TCR and p2lras induction of NFAT and AP-1 .
These data are consistent with the existence of a Rac-1-controlled signalling pathway operating in parallel with the ERK-2 pathway to mediate p2lras induction of AP-1 and NFAT .
Importantly , experiments with a constitutively active Rac-1 mutant showed that Rac-1 was a sufficient signal for activation of AP-1 , although the active Rac-1 mutant could not substitute for the activated p21lras mutant for NFAT induction .
Expression of activated MAPKK-1 in T cells could stimulate ERK-2 , and the activated Rac-1 mutant can stimulate parallel kinase signal 3929 E.Genot et al .

ling pathways that could phosphorylate and transcriptionally activate Elk-l1 in T cells .
Nevertheless , the combination of activated MAPKK-1 and Rac-1 could not substitute for activated p21ras and synergize with calcium signals to induce NFAT .
There must , therefore , be at least one more p21lras effector required for NFAT induction ( Figure 7 ) .
There are several additional candidate p2lras effectors including the GTPase Rho ( Prendergast et a/. , 1995 ) , and also the GTPase Ral ( Hofer et al. , 1994 ; Spaargaren and Bischoff , 1994 ) , whose function in NFAT regulation remain to be investigated .
p21 ras effects on the MAPKK-1/ERK-2 cascade in T cells are mediated by the serine kinase Raf-1 ( Izquierdo et al. , 1994a ) .
It is not clear whether or not there are multiple Raf-1 effector pathways in T cells but , in fibroblasts , Raf-1 and Rac-l signals synergize to mediate cellular transformation by p2lras ( Qiu et al. , 1995 ) .
We currently are exploring functional interactions between Raf-1 and Rac-1 in NFAT induction .
In this context , Jurkat cells expressing constitutively active Raf-1 show enhanced levels of IL-2 production but there has not been a direct analysis of the role of Raf-1 in NFAT regulation ( Owaki et al. , 1993 ) .
Questioning how p21ras would regulate Rac-1 , a couple of recent reports raise some possibilities .
Thus , a report has described phosphatidyl inositol 3 ' kinase ( PtdIns 3 kinase ) as an upstream regulator of Rac-1 in fibroblasts , 3930 particularly in regulating cell adhesion and morphology ( Rodriguez-Viciana et a/. , 1994 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) .
Also , PtdIns 3 kinase can bind directly to activated p21 ras , and function as an effector molecule for p2 1 ras in neuronal cells ( Rodriguez-Viciana et a/. , 1994 ) .
There is , therefore , the possibility that PtdIns 3 kinase could be the link between Ras and Rac-1 .
Preliminary experiments show that PtdIns 3 kinase inhibitors ( wortmannin and LY 294002 ) fail to show any inhibitory effect on TCR induction of NFAT ( E.Genot , K.Reif and D.A.Cantrell , unpublished data ) .
The failure of PtdIns 3 kinase inhibitors to regulate NFAT is not compatible with a role for PtdIns 3 kinase as a mediator of p2lras effects on NFAT .
Accordingly , the signalling links between p21ras , PtdIns 3 kinase and Rac-1 in T cells may be different from those described in other cell lineages .
However , this question has to be investigated further with different and complementary approaches .
Concerning the Rac-1 effector pathway for NFAT induction , Rac-l-regulated protein kinases have now been identified ( Manser et al. , 1994 ; Martin et al. , 1995 ) , but the role of these protein kinases in Rac-l effector pathways in T cells remains to be discovered .
The transcriptional activity of the NFAT binding site used in the present experiments is mediated by a complex comprising a member of the NFAT group of DNA binding proteins and AP-1 family proteins ( Rao , 1994 ) .

Schematic representation of signalling pathways predicted to induce NFAT .
Our model for NFAT induction shows calcium/ calcineurin signals regulating NFAT translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus .
p2Iras /Rac-1 regulation of NFAT involves regulation of AP-1 .
MAPKK-1 signalling pathways are also required for NFAT induction and , since MAPKK-1 does not regulate AP-1 , we would predict that MAPKK-1 pathways regulate NFAT itself or the NFAT AP-1 complex .
To explain why the combination of activated MAPKK-1 and activated Rac-1 do not substitute for activated p21ras for NFAT induction , we have to evoke the existence of at least one more p21ras signalling pathway .
The contribution of PKC to NFAT regulation is complicated because the TCR activates PKC but this is not required for NFAT induction .
Phorbol esters can regulate NFAT , but this occurs by an independent PKC-mediated pathway that converges on MAPKK-1 and Rac-1 .
complex is composed of dimers of members of the Fos and Jun family of proteins .
The exact nature of the AP-1 component of NFAT in T cells has not yet been established clearly .
Boise et al .
have described that a Fra-l-JunB heterodimer is the inducible nuclear component of the NFAT binding activity , while Northrop et al .
have reported a dimer composed of c-Fos ( or Fra-1 ) and either c-Jun or JunD , suggesting that the nuclear subcomponent may be represented by a heterogeneous population of AP-1-NFAT complexes ( Boise et al. , 1993 ; Northrop et al. , 1993 ) .
It is not clear whether the AP-1 reporter gene used in the present experiments measures the activity of the AP-1 components of NFAT or of distinct AP-1 family members .
Nevertheless , the present AP-1 reporter gene data are valuable because they show that , in T cells , Rac-1 function is both necessary and can be sufficient for AP-1 induction and that Rac-1 can mediate Ras effects on AP-1 .
Moreover , the activated Rac-1 mutants were equivalent to the activated Ras mutants in the context of AP-1 induction .
This role of Rac-l in AP-1 regulation could thus explain Rac-1 requirement for NFAT induction .
Accordingly , to consider the possible Rac-1 effector pathways in T cells , it is necessary to focus on the mechanisms for AP-1 induction .
In general , the activation of AP-1 results from increased expression of Fos and Jun family proteins and NFAT regulation in T cells the phosphorylation of Fos and Jun proteins which up-regulates their transcription activity .
Several parallel MAP kinase signalling pathways involving ERK-1 , -2 , JNK-1 , -2 and MPK2/p38 and a Ras-regulated Fos kinase can all potentially contribute to AP-1 activation ( Deng and Karin , 1994 ; Cobb and Goldsmith , 1995 ; Coso et al. , 1995 ; Hill and Treisman , 1995 ) .
The TCF Elk-1 which contributes to increased c-fos expression via complex formation with the ubiquitous transcription factor SRF is a substrate for the ERKs and JNK-1 , -2 ( Marais et al. , 1993 ; Whitmarsh et al. , 1995 ) .
c-jun is also transcriptionally regulated by MAP kinase pathways , is a direct substrate for JNK-1 and can be activated by JNK-1-mediated phosphorylation ( Dérijard et al. , 1994 ) .
Recent studies suggest that Rac-1 plays a central role in the activation of the MAP kinases JNK and p38 that is exactly analogous to the role of p2lras in the ERK pathways ( Coso et al. , 1995 ; Minden et al. , 1995 ) .
The present data show that Rac-1 signals are necessary and sufficient to induce Elk-1 phosphorylation in T cells , which indicates that Rac-1 signals regulate transcriptional factor kinase pathways in T cells .
Future studies will establish whether Rac-1 effects on Elk-1 phosphorylation in T cells are mediated by JNK-1/SAPK , p38 or a novel protein kinase pathway .
By analogy with other models for transcription factor regulation by p21ras-related GTPases , then Rac-l effects on NFAT could be mediated by one of the MAP kinase pathways .
Clearly Rac-1 does not regulate ERK-2 in T cells , but it is possible that the role of Rac-1 in TCR induction of NFAT involves JNK-1/SAPK or the p38 MAP kinase .
It is possible , moreover , that the role of Rac-1 in TCR induction of NFAT will be analogous to the role of Rac-1 in serum regulation of SRF transcriptional activity in fibroblasts , which occurs by an unknown Rho/Rac-1-controlled signalling pathway that does not involve ERK-2 , JNK-1 or p38 ( Hill et al. , 1995 ) .
Rac-1 may mediate p2lras regulation of AP-1 and NFAT in T cells but , if the signalling connections between p2lras and Rac-1 in T cells are as complicated as those in fibroblasts , then it is unlikely that p21lras and Rac-1 will function solely in a linear signalling cascade and it is more likely that Rac-1 and p21ras will function in both parallel and convergent pathways .
Rac-1 has diverse roles in many cellular systems .
For example , in neutrophils , Rac-1 is involved in the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex ( Xu et al. , 1994 ) .
In fibroblasts , Rac-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) but can also regulate transcriptional activity of SRF and controls c-jun transcriptional activity via activation of the c-Jun kinases JNK-1/SAPK ( Coso et al. , 1995 ; Hill et al. , 1995 ; Minden et al. , 1995 ) .
In this context , the activation of JNK-1 in T cells is an integration point for signals from the co-stimulatory receptor CD28- and TCR-mediated calcium/calcineurin signals ( Su et al. , 1994 ) .
It will thus be of interest to determine in future studies whether Rac-1 is an integration point for TCR and CD28 signals for JNK-1/SAPK activation .
In summary , the present study has examined p21ras effector pathways in a T cell line Jurkat in an attempt to characterize the signals contributed by p21ras for activation of NFAT .
One p2lras effector pathway involves MAPKK-1 , which is shown by the present data to be both necessary and sufficient for activation of ERK-2 and the 3931 E.Genot et al .
transcription factor Elk-1 in Jurkat cells .
Rac- !
is a sufficient and necessary signal for AP-1 activation and also appears to be involved in p2lras effector pathways in Jurkat , since p21lras-mediated induction of AP-1 and NFAT requires Rac-1 function .
MAPKK-1- and Rac- ! -mediated signals may be sufficient for either ERK-2 or AP-1 activation but , either alone or in combination , they can not substitute fully for p21ras signals for induction of NFAT .
There must , therefore , be at least one more p21 ras effector pathway that is required for NFAT induction .
The Jurkat T cell line used in the present study has proved to be a valuable model system for studies of NFAT regulation .
It would thus seem likely that there will be multiple Ras effectors in normal T cell populations that contribute to NFAT regulation and hence cytokine gene induction .
This is analogous to the transformation of fibroblasts where Ras effects are mediated by multiple effectors .
The Rac-1 effector pathway for NFAT induction is not yet character-ized .
Nevertheless , the NFAT family of transcription factors are important in the regulation of cytokine genes and hence important for a successful immune response .
The present data predict that Rac-1 and Rac-1 signalling pathways would be important targets for immune inter-vention .
