EBV nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) , one of the first genes expressed after EBV infection of B-cells , is a transcriptional activator of viral and cellular genes and is essential for the transforming potential of the virus .
We generated conditional EBV mutants by expressing EBNAZ as chimeric fusion protein with the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor on the genetic background of the virus .
Growth transformation of primary normal B-cells by mutant virus resulted in estrogen-dependent lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing the chimeric EBNA2 protein .
In the absence of estrogen about half of the cells enter a quiescent non-proliferative state whereas the others die by apoptosis .
EBNA2 is thus required not only for initiation but also for maintenance of transformation .
Growth arrest occurred at G , and G ; stages of the cell cycle , indicating that functional EBNA2 is required at different restriction points of the cell cycle .
Growth arrest is reversible for G/G , cells as indicated by the sequential accumulation and modification of cell cycle regulating proteins .
EBV induces the same cell cycle regulating proteins as polyclonal stimuli in primary B-cells .
These data suggest that EBV is using a common pathway for B-cell activation bypassing the requirement for antigen , T-cell signals and growth factors .
Key words : Epstein-Barr virus/conditional EBNA2 estrogen receptor/cell cycle/CD40 Introduction Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a ubiquitous human herpes virus with a linear viral genome of ~175 kb .
The virus has a dual tropism for B-lymphocytes and epithelial cells .
88 Infection of B-cells is usually non-productive whereas virus replication takes place in epithelial cells of the nasopharyngeal cavity and leads to synthesis of infectious progeny which are excreted in the saliva .
Primary infection with EBV is usually silent , but may give rise to infectious mononucleosis , a self-limiting lymphoprolifera-tive disease .
After primary infection the virus persists lifelong in the body in the lymphoid compartment in a latent , still poorly defined state .
Infection of B-lymphocytes with EBV in vitro leads to unlimited proliferation of infected cells , a process called transformation or immortalization .
In EBV-transformed cells the viral genome is maintained in multiple episomal copies .
EBV drives proliferation of infected B-cells by expression of a limited set of viral genes coding for six nuclear antigens ( EBNA1I , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , EBNA-LP ) , three membrane antigens ( LMP1 , LMP2A and LMP2B ) , and two small RNA polymerase III transcripts , the EBERs ( for review see Miller 1990 ; Kieff and Liebowitz , 1990 ; Rogers et al. , 1992 ; for details see Figure 1B ) .
Five of these genes ( EBNA1 , 2 , 3A , 3C and LMP 1 ) are required for initiation of transformation ( Hammerschmidt and Sugden , 1989 ; Cohen et al. , 1989 ; Kaye et al. , 1993 ; Tomkinson et al. , 1993 ) , but they may not be sufficient .
The minimal set of viral genes required for initiation of transformation is still unknown .
EBNA2 is one of the first genes expressed after EBV infection of B-cells ( Allday et al. , 1989 ; Rooney et al. , 1989 ) .
It is a transcriptional activator of viral and cellular genes and is essential for the transforming potential of the virus .
EBNA2 modulates host cell gene expression by induction of cellular antigens CD21 and CD23 ( Calender et al. , 1987 ; Wang et al. , 1987 ; Cordier et al. , 1990 ) and the proto-oncogene c-fgr ( Knutson et al. , 1990 ) .
EBNA2 activates transcription of the genes of the three virally encoded membrane antigens ( Abbot et al. , 1990 ; Fahraeus et al. , 1990 ; Zimber-Strobl et al. , 1991 ) .
In addition , one of the promoters ( Cp ) driving transcription of all nuclear antigens including EBNAZ is activated by EBNA2 ( Sung et al. , 1991 , Rooney et al. , 1992 ; see Figure 1B for details ) .
EBNA2 does not bind to DNA directly .
It transactivates the LMP2A and C promoter through binding to a cellular protein which binds to specific sequence elements ( EBNA2 responsive element , EBNA2RE ) and mediates the EBNA2 response ( Ling et al. , 1993 ; Zimber-Strobl et al. , 1993 ) .
This cellular protein has recently been identified as RBP-Jx ( Henkel et al. , 1994 ; Zimber-Strobl et al. , personal communication ) , a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved protein which was characterized and cloned by virtue of its ability to bind to the recombination signal of the murine immunoglobulin x joining region ( Matsunami et al. , 1989 ) .
Although detailed information is accumulating on the expression of viral and cellular genes in cells transformed © Oxford University Press by Epstein-Barr virus in vitro , our knowledge on the initial events and the pathway activated by the virus lags far behind for a number of reasons .
First , transformation of a B-cell from primary infection to outgrowth of a lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL ) is a non-synchronous process which takes place in only a minority of cells over several days ( Chan et al. , 1986 ) .
It is therefore difficult to assess biochemically the order of events and to draw conclusions about their causal relationship .
Secondly , growth transformation by EBV is a complex process .
It involves not only the interplay of at least five viral genes but also stimulation of the target cell through the virus receptor ( Hutt-Fletcher , 1987 ) .
All attempts to transform primary human B-cells by transfection of intact viral DNA or viral DNA fragments have thus been unsuccessful so far .
Thirdly , the lack of a permissive tissue culture system for propagation of the virus has precluded the development of , for example , temperature-sensitive mutants in viral gene functions required for transformation .
The only source of the virus so far are EBV-carrying lymphoid cell lines in which a small and variable proportion of cells can be induced for lytic viral replication .
The discovery of the lytic origin of replication and the viral packaging signal ( Hammerschmidt and Sugden , 1988 ) has opened new avenues for EBV genetics , since viral sequences modified or mutated in vitro can now be incorporated into infectious virions .
We describe here the development of an EBV mutant which can transform primary resting B-cells in a reversible fashion .
This mutant allows reconstitution of the sequential steps of B-cell activation following primary infection and provides an experimental system for the molecular analysis of the critical events .
Results Primary human B-cells can be transformed by EBV encoding EBNAZ-estrogen receptor fusion proteins Gene fusion of the hormone binding domain of a steroid receptor to an unrelated gene can render the chimeric gene product hormone inducible ( Kumar et al. , 1986 ; Picard et al. , 1988 ; Eilers et al. , 1989 ; Burk et al. , 1991 ) .
Fusion proteins of EBNA2Z with the estrogen receptor ( ER ) were constructed which carry the hormone binding domain either at the C- or N-terminus ( designated EBNA2/ER or ER/EBNA2 , respectively ) .
Conditional function of both constructs in the presence or absence of hormone was verified by testing the transactivation of the latent membrane protein ( LMP ) genes which are known target genes for transcriptional activation by EBNA2Z .
Transactivation of these genes by EBNA2/estrogen receptor chimeras was indeed estrogen dependent ( Kempkes et al. , manuscript in preparation ) .
The genes encoding the conditional EBNA2 mutants were cloned into a mini-EBV vector ( Figure 1A ; Hammerschmidt and Sugden , 1989 ) .
Mini-EBV plasmids carry the cis-acting elements which are essential for the propagation of these plasmids in all phases of the Epstein-Barr virus life cycle ( for review see Kieff and Liebowitz , 1990 ) .
They carry the plasmid origin of replication ( oriP ; Yates et al. , 1984 ) , which is required for the maintenance of the EBV plasmids in target cells , the lytic origin of replication ( oriLyt ) , which allows replication to EBV induction of early G ; -regulating proteins high copy number as large concatemers upon induction of the lytic cycle , and the terminal repeats ( TR ) , which permit packaging of the mini-EBV plasmids into virions ( Hammerschmidt and Sugden , 1988 ) .
The non-transforming P3HR 1 strain of EBV , in which the EBNA2 open reading frame has been deleted ( Mueller-Lantzsch et al. , 1985 ) served as a helper virus for amplification and packaging of these mini-EBV plasmids .
P3HR1 ( HHS14 subclone 16 ; Rabson et al. , 1982 ) cells were transfected with mini-EBV plasmids expressing chimeric or wild-type EBNA2 and simultaneously induced for lytic cycle replication .
Supernatants of transfected cells containing mini-EBVs together with the P3HR1 helper virus were harvested and used to co-infect primary B-cells , which were cultivated in the presence of estrogen .
The results of five independent experiments compiled in Table I indicate that clones expressing wild-type EBNA2 were more easily obtained than clones expressing ER/EBNA2 or EBNA2/ER .
Continuously growing clones were expanded for further analysis .
B-cells transformed by EBNA2/estrogen receptor mutants expressed EBNA2 fusion proteins of an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa in contrast to the 86 kDa protein of wild-type EBNA2 ( Figure 3 ) .
The absence of the wild-type EBNA2 gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis in EBNA2/estrogen receptor-transformed B-cells ( data not shown ) .
Of eight transformed cell clones analysed , all contained mini-EBV plasmids expressing the chimeric EBNAZ protein as autonomously replicating plasmids plus the P3HR1 viral genome , thus complementing the EBNA2 deletion of the P3HR1 virus in trans .
Lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing the EBNA2/estrogen receptor fusion proteins proliferated more slowly than cells expressing wild-type EBNA2 .
Functional EBNAZ is required for maintenance of B-cell transformation by EBV When estrogen was withdrawn from the culture medium of the EBNAZ2/estrogen receptor-transformed B-cells , phenotypic changes became readily apparent .
The cells no longer formed the typical tight clumps and a significant proportion of the cells entered apoptosis , as indicated by fragmented nuclei after acridine orange staining ( data not shown ) .
All B-cell clones expressing either of the two EBNA2 derivatives ( ER/EBNA2 and EBNA2/ER ) stopped growing but retained 50 % viability of the starting population for 5 days as measured by MTT conversion ( Mosmann , 1983 ; Figure 2A ) and propidium iodide and trypan blue exclusion assays ( data not shown ) after removal of estrogen from the culture medium .
Growth of recombinant LCL clones expressing wild-type EBNA2 was not affected by addition or removal of estrogen .
DNA synthesis gradually decreased upon withdrawal of estrogen and reached basal levels on days 4-5 ( Figure 2B ) .
Removal of estrogen also affected the electrophoretic mobility of the ER/EBNA2 fusion protein .
ER/EBNA2 migrated more rapidly and homogeneously in the absence of hormone , indicating that switching ER/EBNA2 function on and off is associated with post-translational modification or profound changes in the tertiary structure of ER/ EBNA2Z .
Furthermore , the amount of ER/EBNA2 fusion protein appeared to decrease in the absence of hormone , compatible with a functional role of EBNA2 in positive 89 B.Kempkes et al .

Strategy for expression of conditional EBNA2 mutants in growth transformed B-cells .
( A ) Mini-EBV plasmids are composed of cis-acting elements which are essential for the propagation of these plasmids in all phases of the Epstein-Barr virus life cycle .
They carry the plasmid origin of replication ( oriP ) necessary for the maintenance of the EBV plasmids in target cells , the lytic origin of replication ( oriLyt ) , which allows high copy number amplification upon induction of lytic replication of the virus , and the terminal repeats ( TR ) , which allow packaging of the mini-EBV plasmids into virions .
The hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor ( white boxes ) was fused to either the C- or the N-terminus of the wild-type EBNA2 open reading frame ( black boxes ) yielding the EBNA2/ER or ER/EBNA2 mutants , respectively .
The EBNA2 expression cassettes are flanked by EBV sequences , the BamHI restriction fragments C , W , Y and H of the EBV genome , which represent in part the genomic organization of the EBV DNA and encompass the deletion present in the non-transforming P3HR1 EBV strain ( AP3HR1 open bar in B ) .
EBNA2 and EBNA2 mutants can be transcribed from two alternative promoters situated in the C or W fragments .
( B ) The EBV map shows in addition the position of EBNAs and LMPs transcribed in growth transformed B-cells and the location of their promoters relative to the BamHI restriction map of EBV strain B95.8 .

regulation of its own promoter ( Sung et al. , 1991 ; Rooney et al. , 1992 ) .
LMP1 belongs to the group of viral genes known to be transcriptionally activated by EBNA2Z .
It is the only EBV expressing wild-type EBNA2 .
Upon removal of estrogen , LMP1 protein was significantly down-regulated , indicating that LMP1 is under the stringent control of EBNA2 in these cells .
EBNA1 protein , in contrast , was not affected latent gene defined as oncogenic by its potential to transform established rodent fibroblasts ( Wang et al. , 1985 ) .
In addition , it enhances the expression of B-cell activation markers and induces DNA synthesis in resting B-cells ( Peng and Lundgren , 1992 ) .
LMP ! 1 was expressed at a lower level in cells transformed by the conditional mutant virus than in cells transformed by wild-type EBV .
The lower level of LMP1 expression may be responsible for the slower proliferation of cells expressing EBNA2/ estrogen receptor fusion proteins compared with cells 90 by removal of estrogen ( Figure 3 ) .
This suggests that under the experimental conditions described either EBNA 1 is very stable or expression of EBNA1 does not require EBNA2 .

Removal of estrogen from EBNAZ/estrogen receptor-transformed B-cells results in growth arrest and gradual decrease of DNA synthesis .
( A ) Clones expressing either ER/EBNA2 ( clone ER/ EB2-5 ) , EBNAZ/ER ( clone EB2/ER34 ) or wild-type EBNA2 ( clone EB2-2 ) were cultivated in the presence ( shaded bars ) or absence of estrogen ( black bars ) for 5 days and cell proliferation determined by MTT conversion for 30 000 cells on day 0 and 5 after seeding of the cells .

Withdrawal of hormone from the culture medium severely decreased the proportion of S-phase cells in the population of viable cells whereas the relative proportion of cells in G ; versus G ; , was not significantly altered .
The relative proportions were 56 % G , to 30 % G , /M cells in proliferating cultures , and 68 % G , to 30 % G , /M cells in growth arrested cultures ( Figure 4 ) .
The presence of two subpopulations corresponding to G ; - and G , -phase cells was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a biotin-labelled immunoglobulin A gene and a digoxigenin probe specific for the centromere of chromosome 17 ( Lichter et al. , 1990 ; Selig et al. , 1992 ) .
Since centromeres segregate only at the onset of mitosis , the centromere-specific hybridization signals serve as control for the diploidy of the cell ( Figure 5 ) .
No metaphase chromosomes were detected in growth arrested cell populations indicating that progression into mitosis was inhibited .
Since the distribution of cells in G ; and G , was not altered significantly after estrogen depletion , the presence of G ; and G , cells indicates that at least two restriction points of the cell cycle , before and after the S phase , are directly or indirectly controlled by EBNA2 .

LMPI is down-regulated in ER/EBNA2-expressing clones cultured in the absence of estrogen .
Cells were harvested after cultivation for 3 days in the presence or absence of estrogen , lysed and the extracts analysed by Western blotting for EBNAZ , EBNA ! 1 and LMP1 expression .
Cells arrested in G ; phase re-enter the cell cycle upon addition of estrogen DNA synthesis could be re-induced in the non-apoptotic subpopulation ~18 h after the addition of estrogen ( Figure 6A ) .
Cytogenetic analyses of the cells released from growth arrest revealed that cells in metaphase of mitosis were only detected after the onset of DNA synthesis ( data not shown ) .
In addition , no metaphase plates were detected when DNA synthesis was inhibited by metothrexate .
These findings indicate that only cells arrested in G ; are capable of re-entering the cell cycle .
To address the mechanism of EBNA2-dependent growth control in our experimental system , we analysed the expression of several cellular and viral proteins which are likely to be involved in the induction of DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression .
LMP1 and MYC expression was induced as early as 3 h after estrogen addition ( Figure 6A ) .
Both genes have been reported to induce DNA synthesis in resting cells ( Eilers et al. , 1989 ; Peng and Lundgren , 1992 ) and could play a key role in initiating the re-entry of the cells into the cell cycle .
Cyclins are regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent kinases ( ecdks or edes ) , which regulate progression of cells through the cell cycle .
The cyclin partners of cdk4 are of D-type , edk2 associates preferentially with cyclin E and cyclin A , cdc2 forms complexes with cyclins A and B which are functional in G , ( reviewed in Sherr , 1993 ; Pines , 1993 ) .
Of the D cyclins , which are expressed early in G1 in mammalian cells , cyclin D2 became detectable after 5-7 h followed by Cdk4 ~2 h later ( Figure 6B ) .
Neither cyclin D1 nor cyclin D3 could be detected , consistent with the finding that cyclin D2 is preferentially expressed in EBV-transformed cells ( Palmero et al. , 1993 ) .
Cyclin D2 up-regulation preceded the modification of Rb observed 10 h after addition of hormone , when part of the Rb protein started to migrate more slowly presumably representing a phosphorylated form of Rb .

Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle status in proliferating and non-proliferating estrogen-deprived cultures .
ER/EBNAZ-expressing transformed B-cells were cultured in the presence or absence of estrogen for 4 days .
The DNA content was determined after staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide .
Apoptotic and dead cells were excluded from the analysis , since their degraded DNA overlapped the S-phase signals and obscured the results .
The dots represent the direct results of the measurements .
The lines indicate the relative calculated proportion of cells in G ; ( punctuated ) , S ( diagonally hatched ) and G ; ( vertically hatched area ) phases of the cell cycle .
which is maintained inactive by binding to the hypophos-phorylated form of Rb ( Helin et al. , 1992 ) , became detectable concomitantly with the modification of Rb .
Cyclin E was constitutively expressed at low level and increased significantly 12-16 h after estrogen addition .
Remarkably , despite a significant proportion of cells in G , ( 30 % ) , cyclin A and cyclin B1 ( data not shown ) were absent from estrogen-deprived cells .
After addition of hormone , cyclin A was first detected before cells entered the S phase .
Since cyclin A and cyclin B are required for G ; , /M transition ( Pagano et al. , 1992 ) , the absence of both cyclins may explain the failure of cells at the G ; stage to enter mitosis upon addition of estrogen .
The levels of p53 , cdc2 and cdk2 , which are expressed in growth arrested ER/EBNA2Z cells , stayed fairly constant or increased gradually throughout the experiment .
As demonstrated in Figure 6B ( right panel ) , expression of all proteins analysed during our studies was unaffected by estrogen in EBV-transformed cell clones expressing wild-type EBNA2 ( EB2-3 ) .
Importantly , the pattern of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase gene expression was identical in primary B-cells infected by EBV in vitro and the conditionally transformed lymphoblastoid cells restimulated with estrogen ( Figure 7 ) .
EBV and polyclonal B cell stimuli activate a common pathway for cell cycle entry The expression pattern of cell cycle regulating genes accumulating at specific stages before and during the onset of S phase indicated that the estrogen-deprived cells which re-entered into the cell cycle upon addition of estrogen had been arrested in early G , phase .
Induction of proliferation of normal resting B-cells can be achieved by CD40 92 ligand or anti-CD40 antibodies mimicking T-cell-dependent B-cell activation ( Banchereau , et al. , 1991 ) or by Staphylococcus aureus particles mimicking antigen binding .
To determine whether EBV is using the same or a different pathway for induction of proliferation , we compared the pattern of expression of cell cycle regulating genes observed after anti-CD40 and SAC treatment with that induced by EBV .
As shown in Figure 7 , cyclins D2 , E and cdk4 were absent from resting cells and were induced by anti-CD40 antibodies and S.auwreus treatment .
In contrast , cdk2 was already present in resting cells and expression did not change significantly following either treatment .
CD40 and S.aureus thus induce the same set of proteins as infection of cell with EBV or reactivation of EBNA2 in our model system .
We may conclude that stimulation of growth by EBV is induced through a pathway which is also physiologically used for polyclonal B-cell activation .
Discussion Studies aiming to elucidate the growth promoting potential of EBV genes by introducing them into B-cells face a general problem .
Expression of viral genes in continuously proliferating B-cell lymphoma lines is feasible and also potentially useful for biochemical characterization of the viral gene product .
However , since the cells are already continuously proliferating for reasons unrelated to EBV infection , this approach by definition precludes an answer to the question of what the viral gene product might contribute to growth regulation .
To study growth control , primary resting B-cells are the only relevant target .
However , no one has ever succeeded in transforming of primary G1 - phase cells + estrogen - estrogen EBV induction of early G ; -regulating proteins 62 - phase cells Fig .

Cell cycle analysis by in situ hybridization of interphase nuclei .
R/EBNA2-5 nuclei of cultures grown in the presence ( a and b ) or absence ( e and d ) of estrogen were hybridized simultaneously with a probe specific for the Igl locus ( Combriato and Klobeck , 1991 , green fluorescence ) and a second probe specific for the centromere of chromosome 17 ( Selig et al. , 1992 , red fluorescence ) .
Following in situ hybridization , unreplicated gene loci in interphase nuclei give rise to singlet and replicated DNA loci to doublet signals .
Centromere-specific probes appear as bright singlet signals in interphase nuclei and can serve as internal control for the ploidy of the cell .
The intactness of the nuclei was monitored by morphology after diamidinophenylindole ( DAPI ) staining .
Nuclei containing singlet and doublet signals were present in estrogen containing as well as estrogen-deprived ER/EBNA2-5 cells indicating that estrogen-deprived cells were arrested in G ; as well as G phase of the cell cycle .
resting B-cells into continuously proliferating cell lines by transfection of intact viral DNA or DNA fragments .
It remains an open question whether all failures to transform B-cells by transfection of EBV DNA have been due to the inefficiency of DNA transfer into primary B-cells or whether infection of resting cells by virus particles is a crucial event in the transformation process .
Our experimental system of primary B-cells , which are conditionally transformed by recombinant virus , provides a way out of this dilemma and allows , for the first time , analysis of the function of a viral gene product on the genetic background of a normal B-cell transformed by EBV in vitro .
Studying the role of a conditional EBNA2 protein in B-cell proliferation , we were able to demonstrate that EBNA2Z not only plays a key role in the cascade of events leading to B-cell transformation but is also essential for the maintenance of the transformed state .
Cells deprived of functional EBNA2 enter a quiescent non-proliferating state reminiscent of normal resting B-cells or die by apoptosis .
Growth arrest occurs at more than one point of the cell cycle .
Functional EBNA2Z is thus required in G , ; and G ; , and a role in terminating S phase can not be excluded .
Re-induction of growth is possible , but confined to a subpopulation of early G ; -phase cells .
Removal of functional EBNA2 is accompanied by a shut-off of cellular and viral genes involved in proliferation such as myc and LMP ] .
Whether the c-myc gene is a direct or indirect target of EBNA2 , remains to be shown .
Re-induction of growth was accompanied by sequential accumulation and modification of cell cycle regulating proteins .
Expression of LMP1 and MYC preceded accumulation of E2F-1 suggesting that E2F-1 is not involved in transcriptional activation of c-myc after reactivation of EBNA2 .
Since the e-myc gene contains an 93 B.Kempkes et al .

Reversion of growth arrest by estrogen and expression of cell cycle related genes after release from growth arrest .
( A ) ER/EBNA2 expressing cells ( clone ER/EB2-5 ) were deprived of estrogen for 4 days until DNA synthesis had virtually ceased .
Estrogen was readded to the cultures and parallel cultures were tested for [ °H ] thymidine incorporation and re-expression of LMP1 and MYC protein at the indicated time points .
( B ) Cultures as described in ( A ) were tested for expression of cyclin D2 , E , A , of cdk4 , cdk2 , cdc2 and of p53 , and Rb , and E2F1 protein at the indicated time points ( left panel ) .
In addition , the lymphoblastoid cell line BPL2 , a second ER/EBNA2 expressing clone ( ER/EB2-3 ) and a wild-type EBNA2 expressing clone ( EB2-3 ) , cultured in the presence or absence of estrogen , were analysed for expression of the same set of proteins ( right panel ) .
E2F site in front of the second promoter ( Thalmeier et al. , 1989 ; Hiebert et al. , 1989 ) , it will be interesting to see whether other members of the E2F family participate in the EBNA2-induced c-myc activation .
LMPI and MYC expression was followed by induction of early G , regulating proteins , like cyclin D2 and cdk4 , while cdc2 and cdk2 were constitutively expressed .
Cdk4 is induced after stimulation of serum-deprived macrophages with CSF-1 and addition of serum to serum-starved fibroblasts .
Cdk4 complexes contribute to cyclin Di-dependent phos-phorylation of Rb ( Matsushime et al. , 1994 ) .
Expression of cyclins D2 and cdk4 was not only observed after addition of estrogen , but also after primary infection of B-cells with EBV .
Reactivation of EBNA2 in conditionally transformed cells is thus indeed mimicking the early events in the process of B-cell transformation by EBV .
Adenovirus EIA was recently shown to perturb the cascade of cell cycle regulating genes .
After cotransforma-tion of rat embryo fibroblasts with an activated ras gene E1A induces cyclin A and E , and represses cyclin D1 expression , in contrast to growth factors which sequentially activate cyclins D1 , E and A in the same type of cells 94 ( Spitkovsky er al. , 1994 ) .
In addition , it is now apparent that different D cyclins are expressed in different types of human B-cell tumours .
Expression of cyclin D1 is a hallmark of lymphomas with a t ( 11 ; 14 ) ( q13 ; q32 ) trans-location affecting the BCL-1/PRAD-1 locus ( Palmero et al. , 1993 ; Rimokh et al. , 1993 ; Akiyama et al. , 1994 ) whereas EBV-negative and group I Burkitt lymphoma cells express cyclin D3 ( Palmero et al. , 1993 ) .
It was therefore interesting to compare the pattern of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases induced by EBV and polyclonal B-cell stimuli .
The fact that the same cell cycle regulating proteins are induced by EBV , CD40 , and S.aureus suggests that EBV mimics continuously ongoing B-cell activation , bypassing the requirement for stimulation by antigen , T-cell signals and/or growth factors .
The chronological order of expression of cell cycle regulating proteins observed after reactivation of EBNA2 is initiated by induction of early G ; regulating proteins .
It may reflect a regulatory cascade , in which the expression of a given gene depends on a critical threshold level of a gene product synthesized earlier in the cell cycle .

Induction of cyclin D2 , E and edk4 after polyclonal stimulation of primary B-cells .
Tonsillar B-cells were activated by cross-linking of CD40 cell surface molecules by anti-CD40 antibody in the presence of interleukin 4 for 2 days or by treatment with S.aureus for 2 days .
In parallel , cells were infected by EBV B95.8 virus and harvested after 2 or 5 days .
Expression of cyclin D2 and E and edk2 and cdk4 protein was compared with expression in untreated B-cells .
progression but rather induces B-cell activation and entry into the cell cycle by inducing and maintaining the expression of early G , regulating proteins .
Our findings are in line with the recent report of Sinclair et al .
( 1994 ) who demonstrated induction of cyclin D2 expression and entry from G , into G by EBNA2Z and EBNA-LP in primary resting B-cells .
Since EBNAZ is a pleiotropic activator of the other EBNAs and the LMPs , many of the cellular events observed upon EBNAZ activation may be due to activation of viral genes downstream of EBNA2 .
Considering the role of LMP1 in induction of DNA synthesis in lymphocytes and transformation of rodent fibroblasts , it will be particularly important to see whether constitutive expression of LMPI1 in our system will render cell proliferation independent from EBNAZ activation by estrogen .
Materials and methods Plasmids The hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor was fused to either the N- or C-terminal end of the open reading frame ( ORF ) of EBNA2 resulting in plasmid ER/EBNA2 and EBNA2/ER .
Both plasmids had the overall structure of the mini-EBV p554 expressing wild-type EBNA2 , EBNA-LP and the BHRF1 open reading frame ( Hammerschmidt and Sugden , 1989 ) .
The N-terminal fusion construct was generated by introducing an EcoRI site immediately 5 ' to the ORF of EBNA2 by in vitro mutagenesis .
The gene fragment encoding the hormone binding domain was generated by the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using HE14 ( Kumar et al. , 1986 ) as a template flanked by EcoRI recognition sites and ligated into the EcoRI site in front of the ORF of EBNAZ .
This PCR fragment included the Kozak 's sequence provided by HE14 and excluded the stop codon of the estrogen receptor .
The C-terminal fusion construct was generated inserting Bg/lI and EcoRI recognition sites immediately before the stop codon of EBNA2 by in vitro mutagenesis .
A BamHI-EcoRI fragment of HE14 encoding the hormone binding site of the estrogen receptor was ligated into the Bg/IW/EcoRI sites at the end of EBNA2 .
The subsequent cloning steps regenerated EBV strain B95.8 coordinates 13 944-54 364 ( according to Baer et al. , 1984 ) with two alterations : the Nof !
repeats were deleted and only two BamHI W repeats inserted .
EBV induction of early G ; -regulating proteins Cell lines and culture conditions All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin .
BPL2 is a lymphoblastoid cell line generated by infection of CD19 enriched human B-cells with B95.8 EBV strain .

After electroporation cells were kept on ice for 10 min and then resuspended in 10 ml RPMI1640 cell culture medium .
After 4 days the supernatant of the transfected cell was harvested and filtered through a 0.45 pum sterile filter .
Ficoll-purified primary cord blood lymphocytes or CD19-positive enriched peripheral B-cells were infected with the filtered supernatants by overnight incubation .
Infected cells , seeded in 96 well flat bottom plates ( 50 000 cells/well ) and cultivated on irradiated MRCS fibroblast feeder layers ( 5000 rad ) in the presence of estrogen ( 1 uM , B-estradiol ) , gave rise to cell lines after 4-6 weeks .
