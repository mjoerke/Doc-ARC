Differential Inhibition of Smad6 and Smad7 on Bone Morphogenetic Protein- and Activin-mediated Growth Arrest and Apoptosis in B Cells* ( Received for publication , December 4 , 1998 , and in revised form , January 28 , 1999 ) Akira Ishisaki # , Kenji Yamato§ , Shinichi Hashimoto # 1 , Atsuhito Nakao| , Kiyoshi Tamaki** , Koji Nonakat , Peter ten Dijke** , Hiromu Sugino # $ , and Tatsuji From the { Department of Oral Science , National Institute of Infectious Diseases , 1-23-1 Toyama , Shinjuku-ku , Tokyo 162-8640 , Japan , the §Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology / Microbiology and the First Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery , Faculty of Dentistry , Tokyo Medical and Dental University , 1-5-45 Yushima , Bunkyo-ku , Tokyo 113-8549 , Japan , the Department of Medicine , Chiba University , School of Medicine , 1-8-1 Inohana , Chuo-ku , Chiba City , Chiba 260-0856 , Japan , the t # Institute for Enzyme Research , University of Tokushima , 3-18-15 Kuramoto , Tokushima 770 , Japan , and the **Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , Box 595 , Biomedical Center , 8-751 24 Uppsala , Sweden Smad6 and Smad7 prevent ligand-induced activation of signal-transducing Smad proteins in the transforming growth factor- family .
Here we demonstrate that both Smad6 and Smad ? 7 are human bone morphogenetic protein-2 ( hBMP-2 ) -inducible antagonists of hBMP-2-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells .
Moreover , we confirmed that the ectopic expressions of Smad6 and Smad ? 7 inhibited the hBMP-2-induced Smadl/Smad5 phosphorylation .
We previously reported that Smad ?
is an activin A-induc-ible antagonist of activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in HS-72 cells .
Interestingly , although mRNA expression of Smad6 was induced by activin A in HS-72 cells , Smad6 showed no antagonistic effect on activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis .
Moreover , we found that the ectopic expression of Smad7 , but not Smad6 , inhibited the activin A-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in HS-72 cells .
Thus , Smad6 and Smad7 exhibit differential inhibitory effects in bone morphogenetic protein-2- and activin A-mediated signaling in B lineage cells .
Transforming growth factor-B ( TGF- ) family members elicit their multifunctional effects through heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors ( 1-3 ) .
The activated type I receptor then propagates the signal through transient interaction with , and phosphorylation of , receptor-restricted Smads ( 4 , 5 ) .
Whereas Smad2 and Smad3 act in the TGF - $ and activin pathways ( 6-9 ) , Smad1 , Smad5 , and Smad8 act downstream of bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) ( 10-16 ) .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org of the C-domain ( 16-18 ) , relieves the inhibitory activity of the N-domain and induces homo- and hetero-oligomerization with each other and with Smad4 ( a common mediator of TGF-B family signaling ) ( 19-21 ) .
This hetero-oligomeric Smad complex then translocates to the nucleus and modulates transcription of TGF-B family target genes ( 22-24 ) .
Although we previously reported that activin A induces the cell cycle arrest in the G ; phase and apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells ( 25 ) , we are not aware of any reports on the BMP-induced growth arrest in B lineage cells .
Furthermore , little is known of the precise mechanism by which BMP exerts its negative growth effect .
We report here that BMP-2 induces the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in B lineage cells .
Smad6 and Smad ?
function as inhibitors of TGF- family signaling ( 26-30 ) .
Smad ? 7 forms stable interactions with the activated TGF- type I receptor , thereby preventing the activation of receptor-restricted Smads by competition for receptor binding .
Smad7 has also been shown to bind to and inhibit signaling downstream of BMP receptors ( 29 ) .
In contrast , human Smad6 specifically blocks BMP but not activin signaling in mink lung epithelial cells ( 30 ) .
Smad6 has also been shown to bind to BMP receptors , inhibit signaling downstream of the receptors ( 26 ) , and prevent formation of an active Smad4/ Smad1 signaling complex by directly competing with Smad1 for binding to Smad4 ( 30 ) .
Thus , Smad7 may act as a general TGF-B family inhibitor , and Smad6 may have a tendency to preferentially inhibit the signal of BMP .
However , Imamura et al .
( 26 ) reported that Smad6 partially inhibits the TGF- signal for phosphorylation of Smad2 in COS-7 cells and suppresses the activation of p3TP-Lux by TGF- $ stimulation in mink cells .
In addition , Nakayama et al .
( 31 ) reported that Xenopus Smad6 , which is 52 % identical to mammalian Smad6 , partially blocks the activity of activin in a mesoderm induction assay .
We have reported that the ectopic expression of Smad ? 7 can block the activin A-induced cell cycle arrest in the G , phase and apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells ( 32 ) .
In the present study , we found that BMP-2 also induces growth arrest and apoptosis in these cells .
Furthermore , we compared the effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on activin- and BMP-2-induced responses .
In addition , we investigated the effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on the phosphorylation status of pathway-restricted Smads in HS-72 cells .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture-Establishment and characterization of mouse hybridoma HS-72 cells and Smad7-overexpressing clones ( HS-725M1 and 13637 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 13638 HS-725M2 ) were described previously ( 82 , 33 ) .
Cells were cultured in Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 100 pg/ml streptomycin , and 100 units/ml penicillin .
Plasmid and Transfection-Construction of the Smad6 expression plasmid peDNAS-FLAG-Smad6 was reported previously ( 26 ) .
HS-72 cells were transfected with plasmid by electroporation using an Elec-troporator II ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) at 200 V and 1000 microfarad and then selected by cultivation with G418 ( 1 mg/ml ) .
Single-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution .
MTT Assay-The cells ( 2 X 10 % cells/well in 96-well plates ) were incubated with Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium containing 5 % fetal calf serum and antibiotics in the presence of various concentrations of activin A or hBMP-2 for 48 h and then examined for cell viability by a calorimetric assay with MTT ( Sigma ) ( 83 ) .
Absorbance was determined at a wavelength of 570 nm with background subtraction at 620 nm .
Detection of Apoptotic Cells-To detect apoptotic nuclei , the cells ( 2 X 10° ) were suspended in a hypotonic solution ( 8.4 mM sodium citrate , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) ) , stained with 5 ug/ml propidium iodide , and analyzed by a FACSCalibur ( Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems , San Jose , CA ) ( 84 ) .
In the DNA fragmentation assay , the DNA was extracted from HS-72 cells ( 5 X 10° ) according to the method of Moore and Matiashewski ( 85 ) .
The DNA was electrophoresed in a 2 % agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide .
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis-Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody ( anti-FLAG M2 ) was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) monoclonal antibody ( G8-245 ) was purchased from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) .
Anti-p21° '' '' '' * '' '' monoclonal antibody ( Ab-4 ) was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem .
Anti-mouse Smad2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduc-tion Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) .
The antibody against phosphorylated Smad2 was raised after immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide ( KKKSSMS ) phosphorylated at the last two serine residues coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as previously reported ( 9 , 36 ) .
This antibody specifically recognizes Smad2 phosphorylated by activated type I receptor ( 86 ) .
The antibody against phosphorylated Smad1/ Smad5 was raised against KKKNPISSVS phosphorylated at the last two serine residues and specifically recognizes Smad1 and Smad5 phosphorylated by an activated type I receptor ( 36 ) .
For immunoprecipitation , the cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride , and a protease inhibitor mixture ) ( complete , EDTA-free ; Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) .
The extracted protein ( 600 ug ) was reacted with 1 ug of goat anti-Smadl/Smad5 serum ( N-18 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA ) at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with 20 ul of protein G-Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) on ice for 1 h with gentle agitation .
Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and analyzed as described below .
For immunoblotting , the cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 6.8 ) and 2 % SDS , boiled for 5 min , and then centrifuged at 12,000 % g. The extracted proteins ( 60 pug ) in supernatants were separated by polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1 % SDS and then electroblotted on polyvinylidine fluoride membranes ( Millipore Corp. , Bedford , MA ) .
Im-munodetection was performed using an ECL Western blotting detection system ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
Blots were stained with Coo-massie Brilliant Blue , and each lane was confirmed to contain a similar amount of protein .
Northern Blot Analysis-Total RNA was extracted from the cells using an Isogen RNA extraction kit ( Nippon Gene , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Total RNA ( 10 ug ) was electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted on a nylon membrane ( Hybond-N* , Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
Mouse Smad6 , mouse Smad7 , mouse p21°*'** '' * '' , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragments were isolated from - peDNAS-FLAG-Smad6 ( 26 ) , peDNAS-FLAG-Smad7 ( 28 ) , pCMW35T3 , and pKS821 ( 87 ) , respectively , and labeled with [ a-°P ] dCTP using a Multiprime '' '' DNA labeling system ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
Hybridization and washing were performed as described previously ( 88 ) .
RESULTS Activin A and BMP-2 Induce Inhibitory Smad mRNA Ex-pression-Northern blot analysis of Smad7 revealed that Smad7 mRNA was induced in HS-72 cells stimulated with either hBMP-2 or activin A ( Fig .
14 ) .
The expression of Smad ? 7 mRNA was most prominently induced after 1 h of hBMP-2 or activin A stimulation and decreased time dependently .

Activin A and hBMP-2 induce Smad6 and Smad7 mRNA in HS-72 cells .
HS-72 cells were exposed to activin A ( 50 ng/ml ) or hBMP-2 ( 50 ng/ml ) for various times .
The total RNA ( 10 ug ) was separated and analyzed for levels of Smad7 ( A ) and Smad6 ( B ) mRNA by Northern blotting .
The same blot was serially hybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) cDNA probe .
ern blot analysis of Smad6 revealed that Smad6 mRNA was induced in HS-72 cells stimulated with either hBMP-2 or activin A ( Fig .
1B ) .
Maximal levels of Smad6 mRNA expression were achieved after 3 h of stimulation with either activin A or hBMP-2 .
Effects of Inhibitory Smads on BMP-2- and Activin A-induced Growth Arrest-To investigate whether Smad6 controls the growth arrest induced by activin A or hBMP-2 , HS-72 cells were stably transfected with mouse Smad6 expression plasmid ( peDNA3-FLAG-Smad6 ) .
Two clones ( HS-72Sma6A and HS-728ma6B ) were found to express high levels ( 66 kDa ) of mouse FLAG-Smad6 ( Fig .
24 ) .
Immunoblot analysis showed that the expression levels of FLAG-Smad6 in HS-728ma6A and HS-728ma6B were similar to those of FLAG-Smad ? 7 in HS-728M1 and HS-728M2 .
To investigate whether Smad7 controls the growth arrest induced by hBMP-2 , Smad clones ( HS-728M1 and HS-728M2 ) and the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) were stimulated with hBMP-2 .
A control clone ( HS-72C4 ) showed growth arrest in response to hBMP-2 .
Smad7-overexpressing clones ( HS-728SM1 and HS-728SM2 ) showed no growth arrest in response to hBMP-2 in MTT assay ( Fig .
2B ) .
Next , we investigated whether Smad6 controls the growth arrest induced by hBMP-2 or activin A. Smad6-expressing clones ( HS-728Sma6A and HS-728Sma6B ) showed no growth arrest in response to hBMP in MTT assay ( Fig .
2C ) .
In contrast , Smad6-expressing clones ( HS-72Sma6A and HS-728ma6B ) showed remarkable growth arrest in response to activin A ( Fig .
2D ) .
Cultivation with hBMP-2 for 24 h increased the population of cells in the G , phase from 16.8 to 89.9 % with a reduction of those in the S phase from 76.1 to 3.3 % in HS-72C4 clone .
On the contrary , hBMP-2 showed no effect on the cell cycle distribution of Smad7-overexpressing clones ( HS-72SM1 and HS-728M2 ) ( Table I ) .
As shown in Table II , cultivation with activin A for 24 h increased the population of cells in the G , phase from 17.0 to 67.8 % with a reduction of those in the S phase from 74.5 to 23.2 % in the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) , indicating the cell cycle arrest in the G , phase .
Activin A treatment also induced the cell cycle arrest in the G , phase in Smad6-overexpressing clones ( HS-728ma6A and HS-72Sma6B ) .
However , hBMP-2 showed no effect on the cell cycle distribution of Smad6G-overexpressing clones ( HS-72Sma6A and HS-728ma6B ) .

As shown in Fig .
3A , hBMP-2 ( 50 ng/ml ) decreased the levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb in the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) at 12 and 24 h , resulting in a time-dependent increase in the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb ( pRb ) .
However , hBMP-2 showed no effect on the phosphorylation status of Rb in Smad7-expressing clones ( HS-72SM1 and HS-72SM2 ) during a 24-h culture .

Smad6-overexpressing clones ( HS-72Sma6A and HS-728ma6B ) contained undetectable levels of pZICIP 1/WAF1 when cultured with hBMP-2 ( 50 ng/ml ) ( Fig .
3B ) .
hBMP-2 did not change the phosphorylation status of Rb in SmadG-overexpressing clones ( HS-72Sma6A and HS-728ma6B ) during a 24-h culture ( Fig .
3B ) .
In contrast , an expression of WA* !
was detected in 12- and 24-h cultures of the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) and Smad6G-overexpressing clones ( HS-728Sma6A and HS-72Sma6B ) upon exposure to activin A ( 50 ng/ml ) ( Fig .
3C ) .
Furthermore , activin A ( 50 ng/ml ) decreased the levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb in the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) and SmadG-overexpressing clones ( HS-728ma6A and HS-728ma6B ) , resulting in a time-dependent increase of pRb ( Fig .
3C ) .
The phosphorylation status of pRb seems to be different from the control HS-72 cells and the Smad6- and Smad7-overexpressing cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
The control HS-72C4 clone was almost hyperphosphorylated .
In contrast , the Smad pressing cells were equally divided between hyperphosphorylated Rb and pRb , and the SmadG-overexpressing cells were biased toward pRb .
We have no ready explanation for this phenomenon but think it is caused by the differences in the basal growth rate of the control cells and overexpressing cells .
Effects of Inhibitory Smads on BMP-2- and Activin A-induced Apoptosis-Gel electrophoresis of cellular DNA showed that fragmented DNA was detected much less in -treated Smad ? 7-overexpressing clones ( HS-728M1 and HS-72SM2 ) and hBMP-2-treated Smad6-overexpressing clones ( HS-72Sma6A and HS-72Sma6B ) than in the control clone ( HS-720C4 ) ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
In contrast , nearly the same amount of fragmented DNA was detected in activin A-treated Smad6-overexpressing clones ( HS-728ma6A and HS-72Sma6B ) when compared with Distinct Functional Roles for Smad6 and Smad ?
the activin A-treated control clone ( HS-72C4 ) ( Fig .
4C ) .
These results indicate that an overexpression of Smad6 suppresses hBMP-2-induced apoptosis but not activin A-induced apoptosis .
Effects of Inhibitory Smads on Activin A-induced Smad2 Phosphorylation-To investigate the mechanisms by which inhibitory Smads block activin A signals for the cell cycle arrest in the G , phase and apoptosis , we examined the effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on the phosphorylation status of Smad2 by activin A stimulation with immunoblot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
5A , phosphorylated Smad2 ( approximately 56 kDa ) was detected as early as 30 min after activin A stimulation in the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) .
However , no phosphorylated Smad2 was detected after hBMP-2 stimulation in the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) .
Smad7-overexpressing clones ( HS-728M1 and HS-728M2 ) contained undetectable levels of phosphorylated Smad2 when cultured with activin A ( 50 ng/ml ) ( Fig .
5B ) .
In contrast , phosphorylated Smad2 was detected as early as 30 min after activin A stimulation in the control clone ( HS-72C4 ) and SmadG-overexpressing clones ( HS-728ma6A and HS-728ma6B ) ( Fig .
5C ) .
Effects of Inhibitory Smads on BMP-2-induced Smad1/ Smad5b Phosphorylation-Next , we examined the effects of Smad6 and Smad7 expression on hBMP-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 by immunoprecipitation-immunoblot analysis using antiserum specific to Smad 1/Smad5 phosphorylated at the C-terminal SSVS motif .
Untreated control clone ( HS-72C4 ) contained mostly unphosphorylated Smad Upon exposure to hBMP-2 , the bands representing phosphorylated forms of Smad1/Smad5 were detected as early as 0.5 h and persisted for 2 h in HS-72C4 clone .
In contrast , phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 did not occur in either Smad6G-overexpressing clone ( HS-728ma6A ) or in Smad clone ( HS-72SM1 ) for 2 h after hBMP-2 treatment ( Fig .
6 ) .
These results suggest that both Smad6 and Smad7 inhibit hBMP-2 signals by blocking the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 .
DISCUSSION We previously demonstrated that activin A induced growth arrest and apoptosis in HS-72 cells and that the growth arrest was mediated by induction of expression , resulting in the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation by blocking the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase-4 ( 25 ) .
In addition , we reported that activin A showed a suppressive effect on the proliferation of human B cell leukemias ( 39 ) .
In this study , we found that not only activin A but also BMP-2 induced profound growth arrest of HS-72 cells and the human myeloma cells line U266B1 ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest the possible roles of activin and BMP in the regulation of growth of B lineage cells .
Recently , we demonstrated that mRNA expression of Smad ? 7 was induced by activin A and that overexpression of mouse Smad7 was found to suppress activin A-induced cell cycle arrest in the G , phase by abolishing the activin A-induced expression of p21 '' `` '' '' and hypophosphorylation of Rb .
Furthermore , Smad ?
suppressed activin A-induced apoptosis in HS-72 cells ( 32 ) .
In this study , the mRNA expression of Smad ? 7 was induced by hBMP-2 , and an overexpression of mouse Smad ? 7 suppressed hBMP-2-induced cell cycle arrest in the G ; phase by abolishing the hBMP-2-induced expression of p21 '' and hypophosphorylation of Rb .
Furthermore , Smad ? 7 suppressed hBMP-2-induced apoptosis in HS-72 cells .

Effects of ectopic expression of Smad6 and Smad7 on activin A-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 in HS-72 cells .
A , the cells were cultured with activin A ( 50 ng/ml ) and hBMP-2 ( 50 ng/ml ) for the times indicated .
B and C , the cells were cultured with activin A ( 50 ng/m ! )
for the times indicated .
The phosphorylation status of Smad2 was analyzed by immunoblotting .
The antibody against phosphorylated Smad2 was raised after immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide ( KKKSSMS ) phosphorylated at the last two serine residues .
The amount of Smad2 in each lane was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-mouse Smad2 monoclonal antibody ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) and is shown in the box .
to control the growth arrest and apoptosis induced by both activin A and hBMP-2 .
It was previously reported that pathway-restricted Smads , Smad2 and Smad3 , act in the TGF-B and activin pathways ( 6-9 ) .
Smadl1 , Smad5 , and Smad8 act downstream of BMPs ( 10-16 ) .

Smad6 and Smad7 inhibit hBMP-2-mediated Smad1/ Smad5 phosphorylation in HS-72 cells .
The cells were cultured with hBMP-2 ( 50 ng/ml ) for the times indicated and then analyzed for the phosphorylated status of the C-terminal SSVS motif of Smad1/Smad5 by immunoprecipitation-immunoblot analysis .
The goat anti-Smad1l/ Smad5 serum ( N-18 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. ) was used for immunoprecipitation .
Anti-phosphorylated Smad1l/Smad5 antibody was raised against KKKNPISSVS phosphorylated at the last two serine residues and used for immunoblot analysis .
IgH indicates goat immu-noglobulin heavy chains .
pressed an activin A-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and a BMP-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 , which occurs on two serine residues in a Ser-Ser-X-Ser motif at the end of the C-domain of the Smads ( 16-18 ) .
These results suggest that Smad7 suppresses the activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis by attenuating the activin A-induced signals for phosphorylation of Smad2 , and the BMP-induced growth arrest and apoptosis by attenuating the BMP-2-induced signals for phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 .
In Xenopus embryos , ectopically expressed murine Smad7 can antagonize activin-like signaling ( 28 ) .
Smad ? 7 has also been shown to bind to and inhibit signaling downstream of BMP receptors ( 29 ) .
Xenopus Smad ?
is most closely related to Smad ? 7 ( 74 % amino acids identical ) and acts downstream of BMP to modulate its activity during vertebrate embryonic patterning ( 40 ) .
Xenopus Smad7 was also reported to inhibit activin and BMP signalings in animal explants ( 41 ) .
In addition , Xenopus Smad ? 7 was reported to block signaling mediated by the activin receptor ALK-4 and inhibit BMP-4 signaling ( 42 ) .
Taken to-gether , these findings indicate that Smad7 may act as a general inhibitor of the TGF- family and support our results showing that Smad ?
inhibited the growth arrest and apoptosis induced by both activin A and hBMP-2 .
Afrakhte et al .
( 43 ) reported that the mRNA expression of Smad6 is induced by multiple stimuli derived from the various 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 13642 TGF-B family members .
In this study , we also found that the mRNA expression of Smad6 was induced by both activin A and hBMP-2 in HS-72 cells .
Moreover , we demonstrated that Smad6 was an hBMP-2-inducible inhibitor of the hBMP-2-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in HS-72 cells , suggesting that Smad6 may participate in a negative feedback loop to control the growth arrest and apoptosis induced by hBMP-2 in B lineage cells .
On the contrary , an overexpression of Smad6 was not found to suppress the growth arrest and apoptosis induced by activin A .
In addition , we demonstrated that Smad6 blocked a BMP-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 , suggesting that Smad6 suppresses a BMP-2-induced growth arrest and apoptosis by attenuating the BMP-2-induced signals for phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 .
However , Smad6 did not suppress activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis because of its incapability for attenuating activin A-induced signals for phosphorylation of Smad2 .
These results suggest that Smad6 is a ligand-specific inhibitor of growth arrest and apoptosis in HS-72 cells .
Thus , Smad6 and Smad ? 7 exhibit differential inhibitory activities toward BMP- and activin-induced responses in mouse B cells .
We examined the endogenous protein levels of Smad6 and Smad7 in HS-72 cells by immunoblotting .
Both Smad6 and Smad ? 7 proteins were detected in Smad6- and Smad pressing cells , respectively .
However , the endogenous Smad6 and Smad ? 7 proteins were not detected , even when HS-72 cells were stimulated with activin A and BMP-2 for 12 and 24 h ( data not shown ) .
Whether Smad6 and Smad7 have a role in negative feedback control in myeloma cells will be the subject of future studies .
