2 Characterization of the CD48 Gene Demonstrates a Positive Element That Is Specific to Epstein-Barr Virus-Immortalized B-Cell Lines and Contains an Essential NF-KB Site LORI D. KLAMAN anp DAVID A. THORLEY-LAWSON®* Department of Pathology , Tufts University School of Medicine , Boston , Massachusetts 02111 Received 1 September 1994/Accepted 31 October 1994 Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of mature , resting B cells drives them to become lymphoblasts expressing high levels of cell surface molecules , such as CD48 , characteristically expressed on normal activated B cells .
Here , we report on the identification of an enhancer element in the CD48 gene which reproducibly confers strong transcriptional activity only in EBV-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell lines .
The element is not activated upon infection of established EBV-negative B-cell lines , indicating that EBV fails to drive these cells to a fully lymphoblastoid phenotype .
An NF-KB binding site is an essential component of the element but alone is not sufficient to account for the activity or the specificity of the element .
We have detected a specific nuclear protein complex that binds to the element and show that NF-B1 ( p50 ) is a part of this complex .
The EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 is capable of transactivating the isolated CD48 NF-KB site but not the intact element , suggesting that the latent membrane protein 1-driven activation of NF- « B/Rel must interact with other regulatory pathways to control expression of cellular genes as EBV drives resting B cells into the cell cycle .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a B-lymphotropic herpesvirus that is associated with several benign and neoplastic diseases in humans ( reviewed in references 11 and 29 ) .
EBV infects mature , resting B lymphocytes in vitro , causing them to proliferate indefinitely ( 33 ) , a process that has been termed immortalization or growth transformation .
During this process the virus expresses nine proteins , of which six ( EBNA-1 to -6 ) are located in the nucleus and three ( latent membrane protein 1 [ LMP -1 ] , LMP -2a , and LMP-2b ) are located in the membrane .
Of these , EBNA-1 , -2 , -3 , and -6 and LMP are essential for growth transformation ( 19 , 20 , 39 ) .
The immortalized cells do not retain the surface phenotype of resting B cells .
Rather , they express elevated levels of B-cell-associated activation antigens and adhesion molecules ( 7 , 21 , 36-38 , 41 , 42 ) .
Pheno-typically , therefore , they resemble normal B cells that have become activated in response to antigen or mitogens .
This observation led to the suggestion that EBV does not directly immortalize B cells but achieves this through two distinct processes ( 36 ) .
The first parallels the normal differentiation pathway for resting B cells whereby they become activated , proliferating lymphoblasts ( 6 , 23 , 24 ) .
The second involves arresting the cells at this stage , so that they can not terminally differentiate into plasma cells , resulting in continuous proliferation and the outgrowth of EBV-positive ( EBV * ) B-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( B-LCLs ) .
It follows that induction of the lymphoblastoid phenotype is an essential step in the mechanism by which EBV immortalizes resting B cells .
However , little is known about how EBV regulates cellular gene expression to achieve and maintain this phenotype .
Of the cellular molecules known to be induced by EBV , only CD23 has been characterized at the level of transcription ( 22 , 26 , 43 ) .
Regulatory regions that map to different parts of the gene were identified , * Corresponding author .

871 but the minimal elements demonstrated weak transactivation ( two- to fourfold ) .
We have chosen CD48 as a model gene to address these issues .
The CD48 gene encodes an adhesion molecule ( 35 ) that is induced to high levels on the surface of normal , mature , resting B lymphocytes upon infection with EBV .
Increased protein expression on the lymphoblast surface is paralleled by a marked increase in CD48 mRNA ( 45 ) and remains high on all EBV * B-LCLs .
The CD48 gene is also constitutively expressed in a wide range of EBV~ lymphoid tumor lines , including Burkitt 's lymphomas ( BLs ) .
EBV infection of these cells induces only a modest further increase of CD48 mRNA as measured by RNase protection analysis ( 14 ) .
Therefore , it was not possible to map EBV-responsive elements in the CD48 gene by using these cells .
In this study , we used deletion analysis of the upstream region of the CD48 gene to show that this gene is differentially regulated in EBV * B-LCLs and EBV ~ lymphoid tumor lines .
This has allowed us to map an element that confers strong transcriptional activity only in mature normal B cells infected with EBV .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid constructions .
( i ) Serial deletion reporter plasmids .
Cloning of the 5'-flanking region of the human CD48 gene and construction of the 1.58-kb HindIII-NspI CD48 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) construct ( -1.58 CAT ) has been described previously ( 13 ) .
The CAT construct was digested with HindIII to remove sequences between -1580 and -234 and religated to obtain deletion construct p-234 CAT .
All other deletion constructs were generated from the intact -1.58 CAT reporter gene plasmid by using a Bluescript exo/ Mung kit ( Stratagene , San Diego , Calif. ) .
Briefly , a KpnI-Clel double digest of -1.58 CAT provided a substrate for the exonuclease III enzyme , which digests in from 5 ' overhangs .
The shortened plasmids were blunt ended with mung bean nuclease and religated with T4 DNA ligase , resulting in deletion constructs with the following endpoints : -1,442 CAT , -1,245 CAT , -1,066 CAT , -999 CAT , -869 CAT , -599 CAT , -384 CAT , and -110 CAT .
All deletion constructs were confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA sequencing using the dideoxy-chain termination method ( U.S. Biochemical , Cleveland , Ohio ) .
( ii ) Transfection control plasmids .
The positive control pCMV/HTLV CAT was obtained from I. S. Y. Chen ( 5 ) .
The negative control pSL1 CAT was 872 KLAMAN AND THORLEY-LAWSON described previously ( 13 ) .
The cotransfected internal control construct pCMV B-galactosidase was obtained from G. MacGregor ( Baylor University , Tex . ) .
The LMP-1 expression vector pSV2 BNLF1 ( 2 ) was kindly provided by Bill Sugden .
The mutant construct mt NFkB TK ( thymidine kinase ) contains two copies of a mutated upstream regulatory element ( URE ) NF- « B site from the murine c-myc gene ( 10 ) .
The pCD48 NFB TK CAT construct was prepared by digesting the URE TK CAT construct with BemHI , which should drop out the URE sequences , and inserting two copies of the CD48 NF-xB site ( 5 % -GATCCTTTCA TAAGGAAGGGGCTTTCCCCATTGG-3 ' ) .
The site , with terminal BamHI sites for cloning , and its complementary sequence were synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosystems ) .
The mutant and wild-type URE TK CAT constructs ( 10 ) were generously supplied by Gail Sonenshein .
( ili ) Preparation of enhancer constructs .
Scrial deletion construct -1,066 CAT was digested with BamHI , which opens the plasmid in the polylinker region of the Bluescript KS+ plasmid , 3 ' of the bacterial CAT gene .
A PCR-amplified product , corresponding to human CD48 upstream sequences from -1245 to -1066 , was engineered with BamHI ends and subcloned into the BemHI-di-gested -1,066 CAT vector .
Enhancer plasmids were checked by dideoxy sequencing to eliminate PCR-derived errors and to determine the sense or antisense orientation of the insert .
All plasmid DNA used for transfections was purified with Qiagen maxicolumns ( Qiagen , Studio City , Calif. ) .
Oligonucleotides .
A 34-bp oligonucleotide containing the human immunoglobulin kappa ( Ig « ) light-chain NF- « B consensus sequence ( 5'-ATTCCCCCAG AGGGGGATITCCAAGAGGCCACCT-3 ' ) and a corresponding oligonucleotide with a mutated human Igx light-chain NF- « B consensus sequence ( 5'-ATTCCCCCAGAGGCGGATTTCGAAGAGGCCACCT-3 ' ) were synthesized with their complementary sequences on an automated DNA synthesizer ( Applied Biosystems ) and annealed .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the mouse Ig light-chain NF- « B consensus site was purchased from Promega ( Madison , Wis. ) .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the EBNA-1 and Oct-1 binding sites were purchased from Pharmacia ( Piscataway , N.J. ) .
Annealed oligonucleotides were end labeled with y-*°P-labeled deoxynucleoside triphos-phates and purified over a NucTrap column ( Stratagene ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis .
Mutant CAT reporter plasmids were made with the Amersham oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL .
) , with some modifications .
The Bluescript phagemid ( Stratagene ) with the -1.58 CAT sequences was used in place of recombinant M13 as the single-stranded DNA template .
-1.58 CAT single-stranded DNA was rescued with the R408 helper phage by using a protocol supplied by Strat-agene .
To introduce mutations into the NF- « B site ( -1149 to -1133 ) , the oligonucleotides mutant 1 ( mtl ; 5-GGTTTCATAAGGAAGCGGCTTTGCC CATTGCTGCTCAG-3 ' ) and mt2 ( 5 % -GGTTTCATAAGGAATGGTCTTGCG CCATTGCTGCTCAG-3 ' ) were designed with consideration to the reported frequency of base usage at each position of the consensus NF- « B site ( 17 ) .
Cell culture .
The EBV * B-LCL X50-7 and the EBV ~ BL cell line DG75 were kind gifts of Sam Speck ( Washington University , St. Louis , Mo . ) .
The EBV * B-LCL [ B4 was kindly provided by Elliot Kieff ( Harvard University Medical School , Boston , Mass . ) .
The EBV * B-LCL JY was previously established in our laboratory .
The EBV ~ BJAB line , the BL41 BL line , and their EBV-converted counterparts BJAB B95-8 and BL41 B95-8 were a generous gift of Gilbert Lenoir ( Lyon , France ) .
The helper T-cell line Jurkat , the erythroleukemic cell line K562 , and the fibroblast line HEL299 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , Md . ) .
All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U of penicillin per ml , and 50 pg of streptomycin per ml .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the Dignam method ( 1 ) .
Several preparations of extract were isolated and tested for binding activity with the ubiquitous Oct-1 binding site as a positive control .
The protein concentration of the nuclear extract was assayed by the Bradford method ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , Calif. ) .
Extracts were stored at -70°C .
Transfection of cell lines .
With the exception of HEL299 , all cell lines were transiently transfected by electroporation .
Transfections of HEL299 cells were performed by the CaCl , method ( 16 ) .
For each electroporation , 2 X 10 '' cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline , resuspended in 0.5 ml of Gibco Optimem , and transferred to a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser cuvette containing 20 ug of CAT reporter gene construct DNA and 5 pg of pCMV B-galactosidase DNA , an internal control plasmid included to monitor transfection efficiency .
For cotrans-fection experiments , 10 pg of reporter construct was mixed with 10 ug of the cotransfected expression vector .
Cells and DNA were mixed gently , and the cuvette was placed on ice for 10 min immediately preceding and following electroporation in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser .
Optimal transfection conditions for each cell line were determined by using the positive control pCMV/HTLV CAT .
Analysis of transfected cells .
Cell lysates were harvested 48 h posttransfection , resuspended in 250 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.5 ) , and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles with liquid N ; .
Cell lysates , normalized for protein concentration ( Brad-ford dye reagent kit ; Bio-Rad ) , were used to assay transfection efficiencies in a B-galactosidase assay ( 34 ) .
For individual CAT assays , equal B-galactosidase units were incubated in a total volume of 150 pl containing 250 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 68 uM acetyl coenzyme A , and 0.05 Ci of [ '*CJchloramphenicol for 2 h at 37°C .
CAT activity was assayed by the standard method of Gorman et al .
( 15 ) .
Acetylated and nonacetylated [ '*CJchloramphenicol activity was quanti-tated by analyzing the thin-layer chromatographic plates following exposure to PhosphorImager screens ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .

EMSA .
For protein-DNA binding reactions , 5 ug of nuclear extract was mixed with 1.5 jg poly ( dI-dC ) in a total volume of 20 pl consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 , 5 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride .
Following the addition of 1.0 ng of « -* '' P-end-labeled DNA probe ( ~20,000 cpm ) , the reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 25°C .
Where indicated , a 25- to 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA or unrelated DNA was added 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe .
The reaction products were resolved on 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels ( 40:1 cross-linking ratio ; in 0.5 % Tris-glycine at 4°C ) .
For supershifting electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) , binding reaction mixtures were incubated with 1 pl ( per 5 pg of nuclear extract ) of the appropriate antisera , or a preimmune control , for 20 min at 4°C prior to the addition of the end-labeled probe .
NF- « B1 ( p50 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , and c-ref supershifting antisera were generously supplied by Nancy Rice ( Frederick , Md . )
and Uli Sicbenlist ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Md . ) .
DNase I footprinting .
For DNase I protection assays , probes were incubated with nuclear extract in a reaction mixture that had been scaled up fivefold from the EMSA binding reaction .
The mixture was digested with 10 ug of DNase I per ml for 2 min at 25°C .
Equal counts per minute of bound and free samples were resolved on an 8 % polyacrylamide-8 M urea sequencing gel .
Footprint data were obtained on both strands and the positions of the protected regions were determined by reference to a G+ A Maxam-Gilbert ladder ( 28 ) resolved in parallel .
RESULTS CD48 5'-flanking sequences that regulate responsiveness in EBV * B-LCLs .
A CAT reporter gene construct ( -1.58 CAT ) containing 1.58 kb of sequences 5 ' of the transcriptional start sites of the CD48 gene has been described previously ( 13 ) .
A series of 5 '' deletions were derived from -1.58 CAT , and their structures are shown in Fig .
1 .
These constructs were transiently transfected into a panel of EBV * and EBV~ cell lines ( Table 1 ) to localize transcriptional elements that regulate expression of the CD48 gene .
Relative activities of the deletion constructs are displayed ( Fig .
1 ) for 1B4 and BJAB , representative of EBV * B-LCLs and EBV ~ lymphoid cell lines , respectively .
Data for the most important constructs ( -1.58 CAT and -869 CAT ) are presented , for all cell lines tested , in Fig .
2 .
The largest deletion with consistently high reporter gene activity was -234 CAT .
This construct had promoter activity that reflected the behavior of the endogenous CD48 gene .
It was active in B- and T-cell lines irrespective of EBV status ( e.g. , Fig .
1 ) but not in nonlymphoid lines ( not shown ) , suggesting the presence of a lymphoid cell-restricted proximal element .
Constructs with smaller deletions showed progressively weaker activity until -869 CAT , which displayed only basal levels of activity in all cell lines ( Fig .
2 ) .
In the case of the EBV~ cell lines , the trend continued such that the activity of the undeleted -1.58 CAT in these cells was indistinguishable from the activity of the negative control ( pSL1 CAT ) construct .
However , in the case of the EBV * B-LCLs , the trend was dramatically reversed such that the activity of -1.58 CAT was even higher than that obtained with -234 CAT ( Fig .
1B ) .
Within a given experiment , activations of 15- to 75-fold were seen when we compared -1.58 CAT and -869 CAT in the TABLE 1 .

Mapping of the EBV-responsive element .
Regulatory sequences within the HindIII-NspI CD48 genomic fragment were mapped by measuring the transcriptional activity of -1.58 CAT and deletion plasmids , using various lengths of the 5'-flanking region to drive transcription of CAT .
( A ) Transient transfection results for an EBV * and EBV~ cell lines , IB4 and BJAB , respectively .
A total of three independent transfection experiments were performed in duplicate for each cell line , with a representative assay shown .

A schematic view of the 5'-flanking sequence is shown for each CAT construct , including the positive control and negative control plasmids , pCMV/HTLV CAT and pSL1 CAT , respectively .

same EBV * B-LCL or compared -1.58 CAT between an positive elements , not present in this construct , to account for EBV * B-LCL and an EBV~ cell line .
These experiments demonstrate that the CD48 promoter is negatively regulated in lymphoid cell lines , by elements located between positions -234 and -869 .
These silencers can be overcome by an element that lies further upstream ( between -1580 and -999 ) .
Because this element specifically functions only in EBV * B-LCLs , we refer to it as EBV responsive .
Since the endogenous CD48 gene is also active in EBV~ lymphoid tumor lines but -1.58 CAT is not , there must be additional CD48 gene expression in the EBV~ lymphoid tumor lines .
The CD48 EBV-responsive element is an enhancer .
We constructed a finer set of deletion mutants between -1.58 CAT and -869 CAT to more precisely map the boundaries of the EBV-responsive element .
The CAT assay for this set of deletion mutants is shown for [ B4 ( Fig .
3A ) and is representative of all EBV * B-LCLs ( not shown ) .
Deletion constructs up to -1,245 CAT demonstrated activity similar to that of -1.58 CAT , but the next deletion , -1,066 CAT , and subsequent 874 KLAMAN AND THORLEY-LAWSON J. ViroL .

Reported values represent the means and standard deviations from three independent experiments each in duplicate .
deletions displayed a > 10-fold drop in CAT activity and were indistinguishable from -869 CAT .
None of the deletion mutants in this set displayed detectable CAT activity in the EBV~ cell lines ( not shown ) .
This experiment localized the EBV-responsive element between positions -1245 and -1066 .
Next , we tested this region for enhancer activity by inserting the missing EBV-responsive sequences at the 3 ' end of the CAT gene in the inactive deletion plasmid -1,066 CAT .
As shown for IB4 ( Fig .
3B ) , reintroducing these sequences , in either the sense or antisense orientation , fully restored transcriptional activity in EBV * B-LCLs to levels as high as those seen with deletion construct -1,245 CAT .
This result demonstrates that the EBV-responsive element ( s ) behaves in an ori-entation- and position-independent manner , two features which classically define an enhancer .
DNase I footprinting of the EBV-responsive element .
We performed DNase I footprinting analysis with EBV ' B-LCL and EBV~ nuclear protein extracts to identify nucleotide sequences that could mediate EBV responsiveness of the CD48 gene .
A specific footprint was obtained ( Fig .
4A , lanes 2 to 5 ) when a labeled DNA probe spanning positions -1181 to -1053 was incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from the IB4 B-LCL .
Neither BJAB nor K562 nuclear proteins protected this probe from DNase I digestion even at the highest concentration of extract tested ( Fig .
4A , lanes 6 to 11 ) .
The same footprint was obtained with nuclear extracts from JY but not with extracts prepared from DG75 ( not shown ) .
The protected nucleotide sequence , 5'-GGAAGGGGCITTCCCCA-3 ' , was localized between positions -1149 and -1133 .
EBV * nuclear extracts displayed a similar footprint on the comple- mentary strand ( Fig .
4B ) .
Comparison with known binding sites for nuclear proteins ( 12 , 17 ) revealed homology of the core protected region ( GGGGCTTTCC ) to a consensus binding site for the NF- « B/Rel family of transcription factors .
Mutational analysis of the putative NF-KB site .
We mutated nucleotides in the putative NF- « B motif to determine whether this site is an essential component of the EBV-responsive element .
Nucleotide substitutions that would ablate an NF- « B site as judged from previously published analyses ( 3 , 17 ) were chosen .
Wild-type and mutated DNA fragments spanning positions -1181 to -1053 were subjected to DNase I footprinting in the presence of nuclear extracts prepared from the EBV * B-LCL IB4 .
Lane 6 to 9 of Fig .
5A display the footprinting pattern for mtl , a probe which contains nucleotide substitutions at positions 2 and 9 of the NF-kB consensus site .
A protected footprint was no longer evident compared with the wild-type pattern ( lanes 2 to 5 ) , even in the presence of increasing amounts of nuclear extract .
The same result was obtained with mt2 , which contains four nucleotide substitutions in the NF-kB consensus sequence at positions 1 , 4 , 8 , and 10 ( not shown ) .
Mutated -1.58 CAT plasmids were generated with the same base substitutions described above for mtl and mt2 .
The relative CAT activities of the wild-type and mutated -1.58 CAT plasmids were then compared to determine whether the putative NF- « B site was required for the activity of the EBV-responsive element .
As shown for 1B4 ( Fig .
5B ) , the mutated -1.58 CAT plasmids were not able to stimulate CAT activity following transfection into the EBV * B-LCLs , while the positive control pCMV/HTLV CAT and wild-type -1.58 CAT VoL .

( A ) A finer series of 5'-deletion constructs were generated between -1.58 CAT and -869 CAT and tested for transcriptional activity in EBV * B-LCLs ( results shown for 1B4 ) .
The location of the EBV-responsive element , as defined by fine deletion mapping , is indicated by the thick bar above .
( B ) CD48 enhancer constructs were derived by subcloning the EBV-responsive element ( bold arrows ) into plasmid -1,066 CAT at the 3 ' end of the bacterial CAT reporter gene in either the sense ( - > ) or antisense ( « - ) orientation .
-1.58 CAT and the CD48 enhancer constructs were tested for transcriptional activity in EBV * B-LCLs as described in the legend to Fig .

plasmids demonstrated high levels of activity .
Similar results were obtained following transfection of the mutated plasmids into JY ( not shown ) .
Thus , mutagenesis of the putative NF-kB site resulted in concomitant loss of the specific DNase I footprint and detectable enhancer activity .
We conclude , therefore , that the putative NF- « B site is an essential component of the EBV -responsive element .
Identification of protein complexes binding to the EBV-responsive element .
EMSAs were performed to identify the nuclear protein complexes that bound to the EBV-responsive element .

head ) and two tightly resolved bands ( middle and lower arrow-heads ) were detected ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The middle band was not detected with EBV ~ nuclear extracts ( lanes 3 to 5 ) , even when 10-fold more nuclear extract was added to the EMSA .
The protein-DNA complexes ( middle and lower ar-rowheads ) were specific since they were efficiently competed for with a 25- to 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled target DNA ( lanes 7 to 10 ) but not with unrelated binding sites ( EBNA-1 ; lanes 11 to 14 ; Oct-1 , not shown ) .
If the putative NF- « B site was mutated , the specific protein-DNA complexes were no longer detected ( Fig .
7A ; compare lane 2 with lane 1 ) , nor could unlabeled , mutated DNA compete with the wild-type probe for binding of the complexes when added at a 100-fold molar excess ( not shown ) .
A second band ( lower ar-rowhead ) was also detected with EBV * B-LCLs nuclear extracts ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1 and 2 ; Fig .
7 , lane 1 ) .
This lower band could not be considered specific since ( i ) it was also detected with EBV~ nuclear extracts ( Fig .
6 , lanes 3 to 5 ; Fig .
7A , lane 3 ) and ( ii ) it was inefficiently competed for with a 25- to 200-fold molar excess of the corresponding unlabeled DNA fragment ( Fig .
6 , lanes 7 to 10 ) .
We conclude , therefore , that a specific nuclear protein complex , found in EBV B-LCLs , binds to the EBV-responsive element and that the putative NF-KB site is essential for binding of the complex .

Competitive EMSA analysis was performed with a known NF- « B DNA binding motif as an initial test of whether factors are components of the nuclear protein-DNA complexes detected with EBV '* B-LCLs .
As shown ( Fig .
7B , lanes 4 and 5 ) , competition with a 50- or 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled 34-bp oligonucle-otide , containing the human Igx light-chain NF- « B consensus sequence ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , prevented formation of both the Vou .

Upper and middle arrowheads denote EBV-specific complexes .
The lower arrowhead denotes a nonspecific complex shifted with all extracts .
For binding reactions which include competitors ( lanes 7 to 14 ) , the fold molar excess is shown above each lane .
In this experiment , unlabeled probe was the specific competitor and the EBNA-1 binding site was the nonspecific competitor .
( not shown ) also competed efficiently for binding to the putative NF- « B site , while an oligonucleotide with a mutated Igk NF-KB site failed to compete for binding ( lane 6 ) .
These findings suggest that NF- « B-related proteins bind to the EBV-responsive element .
NF-B1 ( p50 ) is a component of the middle nuclear protein complex .
Supershifting antisera , raised against several NF- « xB/ Rel family proteins , were included in the EMSA binding reaction to identify which protein subunits are present in the specific complexes .
We were able to directly demonstrate the presence of the NF-kB1 ( p50 ) protein subunit in these complexes with two independently raised antisera ( Fig .
7C , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Compared with preimmune sera ( lane 2 ) , the immune antisera clearly supershifted the entire middle complex and altered the mobility of the diffuse upper bands as well .
Therefore , one of the specific nuclear proteins that binds to the EBV-responsive element is ( p50 ) .
Antisera directed against epitopes of the RelA ( p65 ) or c-rel family members did not affect the apparent mobility of the middle complex ( not shown ) , suggesting that it may be a p50 homodimer .
However , we do have preliminary evidence to suggest that components of the upper diffuse bands are shifted with these antisera .
Function of the EBV-inducible element in EBV - B-cell tumor lines before and after conversion with EBV .
The CD48 gene is active in lymphoid lines , irrespective of their EBV status .
The deletion analysis demonstrated that this reflected the action of different positive regulatory elements , an EBV-inducible element for EBV * B-LCLs and an unmapped element for the EBV ~ lymphoid tumor lines .
It has been reported that infection of EBV ~ B-lymphoid tumor lines causes them to become more lymphoblastoid in phenotype ( 7 , 9 , 42 ) .
We wished to test if infection of these cells could drive them far 878 KLAMAN AND THORLEY-LAWSON J. ViroL .

Upper and middle arrowheads denote EBV-specific complexes which are competed for when unlabeled probe DNA ( specific ; lanes 2 and 3 ) or a 34-bp oligonucleotide containing a wild-type NF- « B binding site ( human Ig « light-chain intronic « B site [ big « kB ] ; lanes 4 and 5 ) is added to the reaction but not when an oligonucleotide containing a mutated higkB site is added ( lane 6 ) .

enough toward the lymphoblastoid phenotype to allow the EBV -responsive element to become active .
As shown in Fig .
8A , -1.58 CAT showed equivalent and low activities in BL41 and BJAB whether they were uninfected or infected with the laboratory strain B95-8 , used to make the EBV * B-LCLs in Table 1 .
Furthermore , no difference in activity was seen between -869 CAT and -1.58 CAT in the B95-8-converted lines , indicating that the EBV-responsive element was not functional in these cell lines .
This experiment demonstrates that infection of EBV ~ B-cell tumor lines does not drive them to become sufficiently lymphoblastoid in phenotype to allow the EBV-responsive element to function .
We conclude , therefore , that EBV inducibility of the element is restricted to normal B cells .
NF- < B alone is insufficient to activate the element .
The EBV -inducible element in the CD48 gene contains an essential NF-kB site , and EBV LMP-1 has been reported to activate NF-kB ( 18 ) .
We wished to confirm the latter observation in lymphoid cells and test if NF- « B alone was sufficient to activate the EBV-inducible element in the EBV ~ B-cell tumor lines .
A construct containing two copies of the CD48 NF- « B site cloned upstream of the TK CAT promoter ( pCD48 NF- « B TK CAT ) showed high activity in [ B4 cells and low activity in BJAB cells ( Fig .
8B ) .
A control plasmid ( mt NF- « B TK CAT ) , containing mutated NF- « B sites , was completely inactive in both cell lines .
As expected , -1.58 CAT had no detectable activity in BJAB cells but was highly active in 1B4 cells .
Co-transfection of an LMP-1 expression vector ( pSV2 BNLF1 ) into the BJAB cells had no effect on the -1.58 CAT construct but resulted in a marked transactivation , about 10-fold , of the pCD48 NF- « B TK CAT construct ( Fig .
8B ) and of other con structs containing NF-KB sites from the human or murine Igx loci , the c-myc gene , or the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat ( not shown ) .
The same results were obtained when NF-kB activity was induced directly , via expression vectors for the p50 and p65 components of NF-kB , or by phorbol myristate acetate induction ( not shown ) .
No transactivation by LMP-1 , NF-kB , or phorbol myristate acetate was seen when the NF- « B sites were inactivated by specific mutation ( for example , the mt NF-kB TK CAT construct ) ( not shown ) .
These experiments demonstrate that LMP-1 can induce NF-KB activity in human B-lymphoid cells and that NF-xB , expressed directly or indirectly through LMP can transactivate the CD48 NF- « B site .
NF-kB alone , however , is not sufficient to activate the EBV-responsive element .
DISCUSSION In this paper , we report on the identification and mapping of an EBV -responsive element within the upstream region of the CD48 gene .
Furthermore , we have shown that the element binds a nuclear protein complex , only found in extracts from EBV * B-LCL , and that a functional NF-KB site is an essential component of the element .
Since NF-KB is a classical mediator of gene regulation during B-cell activation , this observation confirms that EBV exploits physiologic pathways to alter the phenotype of resting mature B cells as it drives them to become proliferating lymphoblasts .
The CD48 promoter , localized between positions -234 and -110 upstream of exon 1 , was only active in lymphoid cell lines .
However , the promoter is negatively regulated in lym- Vou .

( A ) The EBV-responsive element does not function in in vitro-infected EBV~ BL lines .
The bar graph shows a quantitative comparison of relative CAT activities following transient transfection of -1.58 CAT or deletion construct -869 CAT into EBV~ BL cell lines BL41 and BJAB before and after infection with the B95-8 strain of EBV .

( B ) EBV-encoded LMP-1 induces NF- « B but fails to transactivate -1.58 CAT .
The bar graph shows a quantitative comparison of relative CAT activities following transient transfection of CAT reporter constructs consisting of either two CD48 NF- « B sites upstream of the TK promoter ( pCD48 NF- « B TK CAT ) or the same construct but with two mutated NF-B sites ( mt NF-xB TK CAT ) or the -1.58 CAT construct .
Each construct was transfected into the EBV ~ line BJAB in the presence or absence of an LMP-1 expression vector ( pSV2 BNLF1 } or into the EBV * B-LCL IB4 as a control .
The experiment was performed as described in the legend to Fig .
2. phoid lines by elements present further upstream , between -599 and -999 .
In order for the CD48 gene to be expressed , the transcriptional silencers need to be overridden , and the positive elements required for this activation are different in EBV * B-LCLs and EBV~ lymphoid lines .
The element required to restore activity in the EBV * B-LCLs was localized between positions -1245 and -1066 .
The sequences necessary to restore activity in the EBV ~ lymphoid lines have not been mapped since they are not present in the largest construct that we have tested , -1.58 CAT .
From these observations , we conclude that there are two distinct mechanisms for activating the CD48 gene , one for mature resting B cells , which is exploited by EBV , and another , exemplified by EBV ~- lymphoid tumor lines such as EBV ~ BL .
This presumably reflects the fact that EBV~ BL is a different cell type from the mature B cell that gives rise to the EBV * B-LCL .
BLs are believed to derive from the germinal center centrocyte/centroblast and do not express the activated phenotype in vivo ( 27 ) .
When EBV ~ BL cell lines are infected with EBV in vitro , a tiny fraction of the cells become stably infected , and these cells tend to move toward a more activated blastoid phenotype ( 7 , 41 , 42 ) .
There is a great deal of heter-ogeneity , between cell lines and between clones from the same BL line , in the degree to which individual markers are altered in their expression by EBV infection .
It is apparent that genes activated by infection of mature resting B cells may be regulated differently upon infection of BL cells .
This is most clearly demonstrated with CD48 .
CD48 is already expressed by EBV ~ B-cell lines through the action of an as yet unmapped ele-ment ( s ) .
EBV infection of these cells is not sufficient to activate the EBV-responsive element .
However , we know that the EBV -responsive element functions in EBV * cells that are truly lymphoblastoid in phenotype , i.e. , the EBV * B LCL .
There fore , we can conclude that EBV infection of EBV~ B-cell tumor lines fails to push them to become sufficiently lymphoblastoid in character as to allow the activation of the EBV-responsive element .
This means that the element is EBV responsive only upon infection of the natural target for EBV , the resting mature B cell .
NF-xB expressed directly or via LMP-1 can transactivate the CD48 NF- « B site when cotransfected into EBV ~ BLs .
This finding suggests a role for LMP-1 and NF- « B in the regulation of CD48 by EBV , yet it is apparent that LMP-1 and NF- « B are not sufficient to transactivate the CD48 NF- « B site in the context of its flanking sequences .
There is precedence for this in the literature , where several studies demonstrate that sequences surrounding the NF- « B site can influence the binding and/or function of NF-kB , for example , with the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain ( 8 ) , beta interferon ( 25 ) , and ELAM-1 genes ( 44 ) .
NF- « B belongs to a family of dimer-forming , ref oncogene-related proteins found in most cell types ( reviewed in references 4 and 17 ) .
The nuclear protein complex in EBV * B-LCLs that binds to the EBV-responsive element of CD48 contains NF-kB1 p ( 50 ) probably as a homodimer .
This was surprising , since the EBV-responsive element is positively transactivating and it is generally believed that p50 ho-modimers do not transactivate promoters ( 17 ) .
However , the other components of the complex are not yet clear .
For example , we have noticed that the DNase I footprint also includes a perfect binding site for the Ets family member Pea-3 ( AGG AAG ) and have , on occasion , seen evidence for a second footprint , about 70 to 80 bp 3 ' of the NF-kB site , that also includes a potential Ets binding site ( see , for example , the 20-pg-loaded lane for the wild-type probe in Fig .
5A ) .
How 880 KLAMAN AND THORLEY-LAWSON ever , to date we have been unable to demonstrate specific binding of Ets proteins to the EBV-responsive element .
NF- « B/Rel family members are expressed in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes in association with a member of the IxB family .
Paradigmatically , signals emanating from the cell membrane lead to phosphorylation and dissociation of IxB from the complex , resulting in the migration of active NF-kB to the nucleus .
It is not surprising therefore , that LMP-1 should be involved in activating NF- « B since LMP-1 is localized in the plasma membrane and , like NF- « B , is regulated in its activity by serine/threonine phosphorylation ( 32 ) .
LMP-1 is the only EBV latent protein clearly demonstrated to act as a dominant oncogene ( 2 , 40 ) and is essential for the immortalization of normal , mature , resting B cells ( 20 ) .
It is inactivated by phosphorylation at threonine 324 and also has an extremely short half-life ( 2 to 3 h ) ( 2 , 30 ) , being turned over by a specific proteolytic cleavage event that also inactivates the protein ( 31 ) .
It is possible that the same specific serine/threonine kinase phosphorylates NF-kB and LMP-1 , leading to activation of NF- « B and inactivation of LMP-1 , which would then be turned over through cleavage .
The nature of the kinase , how LMP activates it , and whether NF-B is the only pathway of LMP signaling remain to be ascertained .
In conclusion , the analysis presented here demonstrates that the CD48 gene is a good model for studying cellular genes that are differentially regulated by EBV in normal and EBV ~ B-cell tumor lines .
We are now attempting to better characterize the mechanism of signaling by LMP-1 and what other factors cooperate with LMP-1 to activate the CD48 gene in normal B cells .
The CD48 NF-kB site is LMP-1/NF- « B inducible in EBV ~ B-cell tumor lines , but the entire EBV-responsive element is not .
By systematically adding back sequences to the CD48 NF- « B site , it should be possible to identify the DNA sequences that confer this unresponsiveness .
Identification of these sequences should allow us to distinguish whether unresponsiveness in the EBV~ B-cell tumor lines is due to the presence of negatively regulating factors or the absence of positively regulating factors .
Similarly , the CD48 NF- « B site does not bind nucleoprotein complexes that are specific to EBV * B-LCLs , whereas the entire EBV-responsive element does .
By adding back sequences , it should also be possible to identify the elements required to impose EBV specificity on the CD48 NF-KB site .
These sites may be the same as those that cause unresponsiveness in the EBV~ B-cell tumor lines .
Once these sites and factors are identified , it should be possible to proceed to reconstruct the entire functional EBV-responsive element in the EBV ~ B-cell tumor lines .
