Steel Factor Affects SCL Expression During Normal Erythroid Differentiation By Barbara A. Miller , Joanna Floros , Joseph Y. Cheung , Don M. Wojchowski , Laurie Bell , C. Glenn Begley , Ngaire J. Elwood , John Kreider , and Carole Christian Steel factor is one of the growth factors that controls the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and SCL , also known as Tcl-5 or Tal-1 , is a transcription factor involved in erythropoiesis .
In this report , we studied the role of SCL in the proliferation of human peripheral blood burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) and the effects of Steel factor on SCL expression in proliferating erythroid cells .
BFU-E-derived colonies increase progressively in size , as determined by cell number , from day 7 to day 14 of culture , with the greatest increase in colony size ( 10-fold expansion ) occurring between day 7 and day 10 .
SCL protein levels in BFU-E-derived cells were highest in day 7 cells and decreased progressively from day 7 to day 14 of culture , suggesting an association of SCL with erythroid proliferation .
In contrast , SCL mRNA levels did not decrease significantly between day 7 and day 14 cells , suggesting that posttranscriptional UMEROUS CYTOKINES and growth factors that control the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells have recently been cloned .
The restriction or redundancy of their biologic action and the mechanisms through which their receptors transduce signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus has been a major focus of study . '' ''
Among these cytokines is the ligand for the c-kit receptor protein , variously named mast cell growth factor ( MGF ) , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , kit ligand ( KL ) , or Steel factor . '' ''
Steel factor is the protein product of the murine Steel locus .
Mutations in this locus lead to several developmental abnormalities including severe macrocytic anemia .
`` * '' When combined with other growth factors in culture , Steel factor significantly increases the number and size of colony-forming unit granulo-cyte-erythrocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte ( CFU-GEMM ) , burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) , and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage ( CFU-GM ) compared to stimulation with each factor alone . '' ''
Recent studies have shown that early erythropoiesis is dependent on the action of Steel factor on early stem cells , and that Steel factor is required for development of committed erythroid progenitors until the colony-forming unit-erythroid ( CFU-E ) stage of maturation . ' ''
In vivo , Steel factor stimulates cell proliferation of multiple hematopoietic lineages in the peripheral blood and marrow of baboons '' and in the bone marrow ( BM ) of humans . ''
The receptor for Steel factor , identified as the product of c-kit , encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor . ''
The signaling mechanism through which Steel factor exerts its effect on hematopoietic proliferation has only partially been identified .
When mouse BM-derived mast cells are stimulated with Steel factor an increase in mRNA levels for the `` early response genes ' c-fos , c-jun , and junB '' is observed , but the individual steps in this pathway linking receptor activation to transcription are largely unknown .
Two transcription factors ( SCL and GATA-1 ) with some specificity for or activity in erythroid cells have been de-scribed .
The product of the SCL gene is expressed in ery-throid , mast cell , and early myeloid cell lines and its protein contains a basic helix-loop-helix motif which binds Blood , Vol 84 , No 9 ( November 1 ) , 1994 : pp 2971-2976 mechanisms are largely responsible for the decrease in SCL protein observed .
The role of SCL in Steel factor-induced erythroid proliferation was then examined .
In BFU-E~derived colonies cultured with Steel factor , colony size was significantly increased compared to control .
In day 7 and day 10 erythroid precursors cultured with Steel factor , SCL protein was increased significantly compared to control .
The increase in SCL protein levels in early erythroid precursors stimulated with Steel factor suggests one mechanism through which Steel factor may enhance normal erythroid proliferation .
SCL mRNA levels assessed by Northern biot in day 7 cells did not increase significantly in response to Steel factor stimulation , suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may also be important in the increase in SCL protein observed in response to Steel .

DNA .
'* '' SCL expression is increased markedly during di-methyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) -induced differentiation of eryth-roleukemia .
'* In K562 cells self-renewal was suppressed by antisense SCL . ''
These findings suggest that SCL has a functional role in erythropoiesis .
GATA-1 is an erythroid DNA-binding protein previously known as Eryf 1/NF-E1/GF-1 .
'* '' ° It recognizes a consensus GATA motif found in the cis-elements of most of the globin and nonglobin , erythroid-expressed genes examined .
GATA-1 is expressed early in red blood cell ( RBC ) differentiation and it transactivates the erythropoietin receptor gene as well as hemoglobin synthesis-related and globin genes in more mature erythroid cells . ''
The SCL gene displays a GATA-motif in its proximal promoter and thus may be one target of GATA-1 action . '' ''
A parallel decrease in both SCL and GATA-1 expression has been observed by in situ hybridization during normal erythroid terminal maturation , '' whereas another study using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) demonstrated high levels of GATA-1 up to day 12 of culture but did not examine SCL .

2972 Because SCL expression is associated with proliferation of erythroid cells , '' '' we determined whether SCL expression is modulated by Steel factor in proliferating normal human BFU-E-derived cells .
SCL protein was highest in day 7 BFU-E-derived cells that are actively proliferating and dramatically decreased during erythroid differentiation .
Treatment of normal human BFU-E with Steel factor resulted in a significant increase in erythroid colony size and in SCL protein levels in day 7 and 10 cells .
However , the levels of SCL mRNA were not significantly changed in the presence of Steel factor , suggesting that Steel factor may largely regulate erythroid proliferation by exerting its effect posttran-scriptionally .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of BFU-derived erythrobasts .
- Peripheral blood was obtained from normal volunteer donors at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center under protocols approved by the Institution 's Clinical Investigation Committee .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( MNC ) were separated on Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Adult blood BFU-E from normal donors were partially purified by 2-aminoethylisothio-uronium bromide hydrobromide ( AET ) -treated sheep RBC rosetting and adherence to plastic .
MNC were cultured in 0.9 % methylcellulose media containing 30 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 9.0 mg/mL deionized bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Cohn fraction V ; Sigma , St Louis , MO ) , 1.4 x 107 '' mol/L # -mercaptocth-anol , 2 U/mL erythropoietin ( recombinant Epo > 10,000 U/mg ; Amgen , Thousand Oaks , CA ) , 0 or 100 ng/mL recombinant human Steel factor ( gift of D.E .

Lyman , Immunex Corp , Seattle , WA ) .
Doses were on plateau for maximal stimulation of colony growth . '' ''
Cells were plated at 1 to 1.5 x 10° cells/mL , and cultures were incubated in humidified 4 % CO ; at 37°C .
Erythroid colonies were counted and harvested at day 7 , 10 , or 14 of culture .
One hundred to 1,000 ( day 7 ) BFU-E-derived colonies were plucked and pooled on each day and the average number of erythroid cells per colony was determined .
Immunoblotting .
- BFU-E~derived erythroblasts at day 7 , 10 , or 14 cultured with or without 100 ng/mL human Steel factor ( Immunex Corp , Seattle , WA ) were harvested and washed twice with phos-phate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
Cells per sample , 1.5 x 10° , were pelleted and resuspended in 40 gL boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer ( 10 % glycerol , 0.7 mol/L B-mercaptoethanol , 3 % SDS , 62 mmol/L Tris pH 6.8 ) .
Samples were boiled for 5 minutes and then centifuged at 10,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove debris .
Supernatants containing the protein content of 1.5 x 10° erythroblasts were loaded into each lane and fractioned by gel electrophoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide gels .
Proteins were electroblot-ted onto Immobilon membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
Membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in TTBS ( 20 mmol/ L TRIS HCL , pH 7.5 , 500 mmol/L NaCl , 0.05 % Tween-20 ; Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) overnight at 4°C .
Membranes were then washed twice with TTBS and incubated with anti-SCL , diluted 1/100 , a rabbit antimurine polyclonal antibody for 3 hours at room tempera-ture . ''
Detection was with an amplified alkaline phosphatase Im-muno-Blot Assay ( BioRad , Richmond , CA ) .
After the primary antibody incubation , blots were washed twice with TTBS , followed by a 1-hour incubation with biotinylated goat-antirabbit IgG ( 1:3,000 ) .
Membranes were then washed 2 % in TTBS , followed by a l-hour incubation in streptavidin ( 1:3,000 ) /biotinylated alkaline phospha-tase .
After three washes in TTBS and one wash in TBS ( TTBS without Tween-20 ) , blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate ( BCIP ) /nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT ) as chromo-genic substrate .
RNA analysis .
- BFU-E-derived erythroblasts at day 7 , 10 , or 14 MILLER ET AL cultured with or without 100 ng/mL Steel factor were harvested and washed twice with 1 % PBS .
RNA was extracted from 5 X 10° to 1 xX 10 '' cells as previously described using an NP-40 lysis method for simultaneous DNA and RNA extraction . ''
RNA samples ( 10 ug/ lane ) were size fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.4 % agarose , 3 % formaldehyde gels in MOPS buffer ( 20 mmol/L MOPS , 1 mmol/L EDTA ) .
RNA was then transferred overnight in 20 % SSC ( 3 mol/ L NaCl , 0.3 mol/L sodium citrate ) to Zeta-Probe GT Blotting Membrane ( BioRad ) and vacuum dried at 80°C for 30 minutes .
Membranes were prehybridized for 5 minutes to several hours at 42°C in 50 % formamide , 0.12 mol/L Na ; HPO , , 0.25 mol/L NaCl , 7 % SDS .
DNA was labeled with 50 4Ci PdATP by random primer extension as described . ''
DNA polymerase I Klenow enzyme fragment and random hexamers were used according to directions of the manufacturer ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Hybridization was performed overnight at 42°C by adding 1 x 10° cpm/ml .
to hybridization buffer .
Filters were washed at room temperature in 2 % SSC + 0.1 % SDS for 15 minutes , then 0.5 % SSC + 0.1 % SDS for 15 minutes , then 0.1 % SSC + 0.1 % SDS for 15 minutes and exposed to film .
Membranes were stripped by heating twice in 0.1 % SSC + 0.1 % SDS for 90°C for 20 minutes .
Probes were prepared as follows : DNA fragments were excised from their vectors and purified after electrophoresis through low-melting point agarose ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) .

RESULTS Influence of recombinant steel factor on BFU-E proliferation .
To confirm previous observations that Steel factor enhanced the proliferation of erythroid progenitors , peripheral blood BFU-E were cultured in the presence or absence of Steel factor and the number and size of BFU-E-derived colonies determined at day 7 , 10 , and 14 of culture .
Results shown in Table 1 indicate that Steel factor has no significant effect on the number of BFU-E at any of the days studied .
However , Steel factor did have a significant effect on colony size when cells were harvested at day 7 , 10 , or 14 of culture .
Colony size increased approximately 10-fold from day 7 to day 10 of culture , whereas only a small increment in colony size was noted between day 10 and 14 of culture .
Influence of recombinant steel factor on SCL expression .
SCL expression was examined during normal erythroid differentiation .
Colonies from partially purified BFU-E were removed from culture on day 7 , 10 , or 14 .
Protein from an equivalent number ( 1.5 X 10° ) of cells from each day was then analyzed by Western blotting using antiserum to SCL .

*Significant change from control ( P < .05 ) .
Two bands of approximately 45 kD and 47 kD were consistently detected ( Fig 1 ) .
SCL protein levels were greatest during early erythroid proliferation ( day 7 ) and decreased progressively from day 7 to day 14 of culture as cells differentiated ( Fig 1 , left ) .
Results of five experiments are shown in Table 2 .
Because SCL levels were greatest during early erythroid proliferation , analyses were performed with and without Steel factor stimulation .
Cells were removed from culture on day 7 , 10 , or 14 .
SCL protein increased significantly in day 7 and 10 progenitor-derived erythroblasts proliferating in response to Steel protein compared with control cells ( Table 3 , P < .05 ; Fig 1 ) .
No significant increase in SCL in response to Steel factor was detected at day 14 of culture , a stage when erythroblasts are maturing and little additional increase in colony size occurs .
As observed in the absence of added Steel , SCL expression in the presence of Steel factor was greatest in the during early erythroid proliferation ( day 7 ) and decreased from day 7 to 14 of culture ( Fig 1 ; Table 3 , P < .05 ) .

A representative blot is shown in Fig 2 .
In the absence of Steel factor , SCL mRNA levels were comparable with total mRNA during the culture period .
Densitometry measurements of SCL mRNA normalized with the 288 ribosomal band from days 7 , 10 , and 14 cells were 1.3 , 1.8 , and 1.7 , respectively ( Fig 2 ) .
Results were similar when the experiment was repeated and when densitometry measurements were taken on less intense exposures .
GATA-1 mRNA levels also remained high during the culture ( Fig 3 ) .
GATA-1 mRNA densitometry measurements normalized with the 288 ribosomal band from days 7 , 10 , and 14 cells were 24.3 , 23.3 , and 25.3 , respectively .
In contrast , 3-globin measurements significantly increased during the culture with peak expression at day 10 , consistent with the observations of others . ''
In these experiments , mean densitometry measurements + SEM for 3-globin mRNA from days 7 , 10 , and 14 cells normalized with the 28S ribosomal band were 9.5 + 1.5 , 33.0 + 1.8 , and 14.0 + 3.6 , respectively .
Used as a control , actin mRNA demonstrated viability of the cultures .
Compared with the 288 ribosomal band , actin mRNA densitometry measurements at day 7 , 10 , and 14 of culture were 7.26 , 7.50 , and 11.5 ( Fig 2 ) , and 9.99 , 9.51 , and 24.5 ( Fig 3 ) .
This suggests actin mRNA levels may increase later in erythroid differentiation .
SCL , GATA-1 , 3-globin , and actin mRNA levels were measured in day 7 erythroid precursors cultured in the presence or absence of Steel factor .
A representative blot is shown in Fig 4 .
No significant increase in SCL or GATA mRNA was observed in day 7 cells cultured in the presence of Steel factor in three experiments .
In contrast , in the presence of Steel factor a significant decrease in 3-globin mRNA was observed ( P = .005 ) .

'* '' Experiments with antisense SCL electroporated into K562 cells provided evidence that SCL may promote self-renewal in erythroid cell lines and may function to regulate proliferation of normal erythroid cells . ''
The importance of SCL in early erythroid proliferation is strongly supported by the elevated protein level for SCL measured here in day 7 cells and the dramatic decrease as cells differentiated .
Significant SCL protein expression in day 7 cells even in the absence of exogenous Steel factor may partially be caused by the presence of small but sufficient quantities of Steel factor in The high levels of SCL pay 7 10 _ 14 SF = - SCL Actin Fig 2 .

$ Globin 28 S mRNA observed here in late erythroid differentiation are consistent with other reports of SCL mRNA expression in DMSO-induced Friend erythroleukemia cells '' '' and in hexa-methylene bisacetamide-induced murine erythroleukemia cells that simultaneously expressed high levels of SCL , GATA-1 , and /3-globin mRNA . ''
In contrast , Mouthon et al '' ' detected SCL expression in 70 % of day 8 BFU-E-derived cells by in situ hybridization , but in only 35 % of erythroblasts from day 12 , suggesting that the level of SCL transcription decreased during erythroid differentiation .
He also observed a parallel decrease in GATA-1 mRNA . ''
Differences in observations of SCL mRNA here compared with Mouthon may be caused by the different techniques of mea-surement .
The high levels of GATA-1 mRNA expression noted here during the 7- to 14-day culture period with Northern blot analysis are consistent with those of Leonard et al '' and Labbaye et al '' using PCR to study GATA-1 .
Our observation that SCL mRNA continued to be present in substantial quantities even in day 14 cells whereas SCL protein levels were barely detectable suggests that the decrease in SCL protein during erythroid differentiation is largely caused by posttranscriptional mechanisms .
Steel factor has been shown to increase the size of CFU-GEMM , BFU-E , CFU-GM , and The ability of Steel factor to interact via its receptor directly with BFU-E has been demonstrated previously .
' '' * '' The Steel factor receptor , c-kit , is a member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor subclass III family . ''
Multiple substrates are tyrosine phosphorylated on murine mast cells by c-kit activated by Steel factor including c-kit itself , the 85-kD subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'kinase ( PI3K ) , p95 vav , and the 44- and 42-kD members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family .
`` * '' '' Tyrosyl phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAP kinase is associated with increased MAP kinase activ-ity '' * and SCL has been shown to be a substrate for ERK/ MAP2 kinases . ''
How the early phosphorylation events of Steel factor interact with regulatory DNA elements to influence cell proliferation is not clear at this time .

STEEL FACTOR AFFECTS SCL EXPRESSION may in part be mediated through the enhancement of SCL protein levels .
This may reflect the ability of Steel factor to maintain high levels of SCL rather than an inductive effect .
The increase in SCL protein in response to Steel appears to largely involve posttranscriptional mechanisms .
However , a small increase in SCL mRNA ( 20 % ) could not be excluded by these studies .
Although a potential recognition site for GATA binding transcription factors in the SCL promoter for exon Ia has been identified , '' GATA-1 mRNA expression was constant throughout differentiation and did not change in response to Steel factor .
This suggests that Steel factor-induced increased erythroid proliferation , at least in day 7 to 14 cells , was not mediated through Steel factor enhancement of GATA-1 transcription .
A decrease in hemoglobin content of BFU-E-derived cells cultured in vitro with Steel has previously been observed by radioligand immunoassay of hemoglobin . ''
Sup-plementation of cultures with additional transferrin did not enhance hemoglobin production ( unpublished results , March 1993 ) .
A decrease in mean corpuscular volume has been observed in animals treated with Steel and this has been hypothesized to be caused by iron-deficient erythropoiesis . ''
Our observation of a significant decline in 3-globin mRNA in day 7 erythroblasts cultured with Steel suggests an additional mechanism may contribute .
An early decrease in 3-globin mRNA transcription in proliferating , Steel-stimulated cells may occur that is not fully compensated for during later development .
The data presented here suggest that ( 1 ) SCL is associated with erythroid proliferation , ( 2 ) Steel factor stimulation of erythroid proliferation may be partially mediated through enhanced SCL levels , and ( 3 ) the decrease in SCL protein during erythroid differentiation as well as the increase in SCL protein in response to Steel may largely be caused by posttranscriptional mechanisms .
