6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor Down-Regulation of IL-12 p40 Gene in Plasmodium berghei-Infected Mice ' Xin Xu , '' Kohsuke Sumita , Chiguang Feng , '' Xiaozhong Xiong , '' Hua Shen , Saho Maruyama , Makoto Kanoh , and Yoshihiro Asano* We analyzed the mechanism that causes suppression of IL-12 p40 gene induction during Plasmodium berghei infection .
Although IL-12 together with IFN-y plays an important role in protection against pathogenic infection , the IL-12 p70 protein production of infected macrophages is lower than that by the uninfected macrophages .
We showed in the present study that the induction of IL-12 p40 gene but not IL-12 p35 gene in macrophages of P. berghei-infected mice was profoundly inhibited .
The inhibition was induced by interaction with macrophages that had contacted with P. berghei-infected erythrocytes and was mediated by a soluble factor , IL-10 .
There was comparable activation of NF-KB in uninfected and infected cells .
The induction of IFN-regulatory factor-1 gene was comparable in transcription level in uninfected and infected cells , while the unidentified complex formation of IFN-regulatory factor-1 was observed in infected cells .
Therefore , the inhibition of the IL-12 p40 gene induction appeared to be regulated at transcriptional regulation level of the gene .
The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 167 : 235-241. mmune responses characterized by the production of distinct sets of lymphokines are optimally protective against different types of pathogens during bacterial , parasitic , and viral in-fections .
Responses dominated by the production of IFN-y provide a defense against microorganisms that establish intracellular infections ( 1-5 ) .
Viral and bacterial infections lead to the activation of innate immunity followed by the induction of a type 1 T cell subset thought to be induced in an Ag-specific fashion under the influence of IL-12 .
Bacterial stimuli activate macrophages and subsequently NK cells in the innate immune response to produce IL-12 and IFN-y , respectively ( 6-8 ) .
IL-12 subsequently induces NK cells to produce IFN-y ( 9-11 ) , which in turn activates macrophages to present Ags to Ag-specific T cells ( 12 ) .
This type of innate immune response and its accompanying Ag-specific T cell response are involved in the eradication of microbial pathogens ( 5 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 14 ) .
Thus , IL-12 plays an important role in protection against pathogenic infection and is a key molecule connecting the innate and acquired immune system .
However , IL-12 gene expression is suppressed during some in-fections , such as measles and Leishmania infection ( 15 , 16 ) .

In a previous report , we demonstrated the inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene expression in peritoneal exudate cells ( PEC ) ® of Plasmodium berghei-infected mice ( 18 ) .
These observations lead us to analyze the mechanism that induces suppression of IL-12 p40 gene expression in P. berghei infection .
Analysis of the regulation of the IL-12 p40 gene will lead to a better understanding of the role of the gene in pathogenic infection .
In the present study , we have demonstrated that the inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene expression was mediated by IL-10 produced by macrophages and occurred at the transcriptional level of the gene .

Recombinant mouse IL-12 p70 proteins were provided by Genetics Institute ( Cambridge , MA ) and were used as a standard .
RNA isolation and mRNA detection by RT-PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium-thiocyanate method .
Equal amounts of RNA ( 1 ug ) were reverse transcribed using 200 U of reverse transcriptase ( Moloney murine leukemia virus ; Promega , Madison , WI ) , 1 mM of dNTP , and 100 ng of random primers ( Takara Shuzo , Kyoto , Japan ) in a total volume of 20 pl .
Reverse transcription was conducted at 42°C for 60 min and 30 pul of RNase-free Tris-EDTA buffer was added to each sample .
PCR amplification was conducted in a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 ( Perkin-Elmer , Norwalk , CT ) using 1 ml of the reverse-tran-scribed product and 0.5 U of DNA polymerase ( Takara Shuzo ) in a final volume of 20 pl .
The reaction conditions were as follows : DNA denatured at 94°C for 5 min , predetermined cycles at 94°C for 30 s , at the predetermined annealing temperature for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min , and DNA extension at 72°C for 10 min .

Results IL-12 p70 production is inhibited in PECs of P. berghei-infected mice To determine whether P. berghei infection influences macrophage production of IL-12 protein , mice were infected with P. berghei blood-stage parasites , and TGC-induced PECs were collected on day 1 .
The PECs were stimulated in vitro with LPS plus IFN-y for 16 h , and the level of IL-12 p70 protein in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA ( Fig .
1 ) .
IL-12 p70 was not detected in the unstimulated culture supernatant of PECs .
The amount of IL-12 p70 gradually increased and reached a plateau at 8 h post-stimulation in uninfected PECs and control RBC-treated PECs , while the level was lower at all points in time in P. berghei-infected PECs .
This result indicates that the observed inhibition of IL-12 production is not due to the nonspecific effect of injecting RBC nor contaminant in TGC .
Rather the result indicates that the inhibition is specific for injecting P. berghei-infected RBC .
Therefore , only TGC-injected mice were used as a control in the further study described in this report .

Production of IL-12 p70 protein was low in P. berghei-infected PECs .
PECs were obtained from uninfected ( ] ) , normal RBC-injected ( & ) , and P. berghei-infected ( O ) mice .
The cells were stimulated with 10 pg/ml LPS plus 100 U/ml IFN-y .
The culture supernatant was collected at the indicated time after stimulation .
The amount of IL-12 p70 in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA .
The sensitivity of the assay is 1 pg/ml IL-12 p70 protein .
Similar patterns were observed in three independent experiments ( * , p < 0.01 ; ** , p < 0.001 ) .
Expression of IL-12 p40 gene and IL-12 p35 gene in PEC is differentially regulated Cytokine gene expressions in the PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice are compared in Fig .
2 .
IL-12 p40 gene induction was strongly suppressed in PECs of P. berghei-infected mice at all points in time that were tested , while IL-12 p35 gene induction in PECs of infected mice was rather enhanced .
TNF- « were induced in uninfected and infected mice at comparable levels ( Fig .
2A ) .
The result was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis ( Fig .
2B ) .
Therefore , the expression of IL-12 p40 and p35 gene in P. berghei-infected mice is differentially regulated , and P. berghei infection specifically inhibits the IL-12 p40 gene expression .
The PECs are CD11b positive Cell surface markers of PECs were analyzed with flow cytometry .
PECs were recovered from plastic dishes by treatment with EDTA and were stained with the indicated FITC-conjugated Ab .
The representative results were shown in Fig .

The PECs were highly positive for CD11b and slightly positive for CD11¢c .
This indicates that the majority of the PECs are macrophages .
They also expressed CD40 , CD80 , and CD86 .
The level of the expression was the same between uninfected and P. berghei-infected PECs except CD80 .
The expression level of CD80 on P. berghei-infected PECs was higher than that of uninfected PECs .

The shaded area indicates the pattern of uninfected PECs without Ab .
Only the pattern of uninfected PECs without Ab was shown , because that of uninfected and infected PECs gave a similar pattern .
Comparable expression of chemokine gene expression in uninfected and P. berghei-infected PECs The induction of the chemokine gene was analyzed in uninfected and P. berghei-infected PECs by RT-PCR .
There was no significant difference in expression of the genes between the groups ( data not shown ) .
P. berghei-infected erythrocytes were phagocytized by PECs To learn whether PECs phagocytize P. berghei-infected erythrocytes , PECs were prepared 1 day after the injection of P. berghei-infected erythrocytes , stained with Giemsa , and observed under photomicroscopy .
Binding of erythrocytes of P. berghei-infected mouse origin to the PECs and uptake of erythrocytes of P. berghei-infected mice by the PECs ( 11.2 and 5.1 % , respectively ) were frequently observed .
A small proportion ( < 1 % ) of PECs carried the parasitized erythrocytes in the cytoplasm ( data not shown ) .
Binding or uptake of erythrocytes of uninfected mice origin were barely observed .

The event occurred in vivo within a day after infection with Plasmodium parasites .
PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice were cocultured in vitro and were stimulated with LPS plus IFN-y to determine what kind of cells were responsible for the observed inhibition ( Fig .
44 ) .
RNA extracted from the 1:1 mixed-culture of uninfected and infected PECs exhibited a less than average value for the IL-12 p40 mRNA expression of the uninfected and infected groups .
TNF-a mRNA induction was comparable in these groups .
The result demonstrated the presence of active intercellular inhibition of the gene induction during P. berghei infection .
The inhibition is not mediated by T cells that might have contaminated the PECs , because PECs cytotoxically treated with anti-T cell Ab were inhibited ( Fig .
4B ) .
Further testing was conducted to determine whether direct cell-to-cell interaction is required for the inhibition observed above .
The culture supernatant of unstimulated PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice was tested for its effect on IL-12 p40 gene induction by PECs of uninfected mice ( Fig .
4C ) .
It was shown that the addition of the culture supernatant of P. berghei-infected PECs inhibited the induction of IL-12 p40 of uninfected PECs .
This result suggests that the inhibition of the IL-12 p40 gene observed in the present study is mediated by a soluble factor .

| Intercellular inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene induction in P. berghei-infected PECs .
A , PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice were mixed ( 2.5 X 10° to 2.5 X 10° mixture and 4.5 X 10° to 0.5 % 10° mixture ) and were cultured on tissue culture plates for 24 h. Adherent cells were further cultured in the presence of 10 pg/ml LPS plus 100 U/ml IFN-y .
To measure the mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-12 p40 , RNA was extracted at 2 h to measure the mRNA expression of TNF-a and at 8 h to measure the mRNA expression of IL-12 p40 .
Similar results were obtained in four independent experiments .
B , PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice were mixed ( 2.5 X 10° to 2.5 X 10° mixture ) and were cultured on tissue culture plates for 24 h. PECs of infected mice were treated with or without anti-T cell Ab and complement .
Similar results were obtained in four independent experiments .
C , A total of 5 X 10° PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice were cultured without stimulation for 16 h , and the culture supernatant was collected and filtrated through 0.22-mm filters .
The culture supernatant was added at a final concentration of 5 % to 5 X 10° of PECs from uninfected mice , and the PECs were stimulated with 10 pg/ml LPS plus 100 U/ml IFN-y .
RNA from the cells was prepared 8 h later and subjected to RT-PCR analysis .
Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments .
INHIBITION OF IL-12 p40 IN INFECTED MACROPHAGES Inhibition is due to the active inhibition by IL-10 produced by infected cells It has been reported that IL-12 p40 gene expression is suppressed by PGE , IL-10 , and TGFB ( 7 , 8 , 24-26 ) .
It is also been demonstrated that Plasmodium parasites produce PGE , ( 27 ) .
Therefore , the observed inhibition may be due to the production of PGE , IL-10 , or TGFB by the infected cells or parasites .
We first tested the possibility of involving PGE , by adding PGE , to PECs in vitro or by treating mice with indomethacin in vivo .
Pretreatment of PECs from uninfected mice with PGE , inhibited the induction of IL-12 p40 gene by LPS plus IFN-y to some extent .
However , pretreatment of PECs from P. berghei-infected mice with indomethacin did not revert the inhibition of the gene induction ( data not shown ) .
These treatments revealed a minimal to moderate effect on TNF-a @ gene induction .
Cox-2 gene induction was inhibited by pretreatment of PECs with indomethacin , indicating conditions were sufficient to block the PGE , system of the PECs ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that the inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene induction observed in P. berghei-infected PECs is not due to the effects of PGE , .
We next determined the expression of mRNA of IL-10 , TGFRB1 , and TGFB2 .
The expression of TGFBI and TGFB2 was inhibited in the ex vivo state .
Induction of TGFB2 but not TGFB1 mRNA was strongly suppressed in P. berghei-infected PECs ( Fig .
5 ) .
Involvement of in the inhibition of IL-12 production was unlikely in the present study , because TGFB1 was induced at comparable levels in uninfected and infected cells .
In addition , the expression of TGFB2 was one-tenth that of TGFB1 and was strongly inhibited in infected cells .
In contrast , P. berghei-infection augmented the induction of IL-10 by stimulation with LPS plus IFN-y ( Fig .
5 ) .
To learn whether IL-10 is responsible for the inhibition of IL-12 production observed in P. berghei-infected PECs , we set up the following experiments .
PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice origin were cultured with or without stimulation with LPS plus IFN-y , and the amount of IL-10 in the culture supernatant was determined ( Fig .
6A ) .
PECs of P. berghei-infected mice produced the IL-10 even in the absence of stimulation .
To determine whether this production of IL-10 by PECs of P. berghei-infected mice is responsible for the inhibition of IL-12 p70 production , PECs were stimulated in vitro with LPS plus IFN-y in the presence or absence of anti-IL-10 mAb , and the amount of the IL-12 p70 protein in the culture supernatant was measured .
As shown in Fig .

D , PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice were cultured without stimulation or were stimulated with 10 pg/ml LPS plus 100 U/ml IFN-y for 24 h in the presence of culture supernatant of PECs of uninfected or Pb-infected PEC cells Responder Responder Uninfected PEC cells +anti-IL-10 ( 1/7200 ) +anti-IL~10 ( 1/100 ) +anti-IL-10 ( 1/50 ) Pb-infected PEC cells +anti-lL-10 ( 1/7200 ) +anti-lL-10 ( 1/100 ) +anti-lL-10 ( 1/50 ) Responder Uninfected PEC cells + IL-10 ( 0.5 ng/ml } Pb-infected PEC cells 239 IL-10 ( pg/ml ) 4 1000 2000 +LPS +IFNy +LPS +1FNy IL-12 p70 ( pg/ml ) HL-+2 p40 / B-actin ( ig/pg ) o 100 200 | g 20 40 so IL-12 p70 ( g/ml ) IL-12 p40 / B-actin ( fg/pg ) o ﬁ igp IL-12 p70 ( pg/ml ) P. berghei-infected mice .

Similar patterns were observed in Uninfected PEC cells none none three independent experiments .
uninfected none uninfected anti-lL-10 Pb-infected none Pb-infected anti-L-10 Pb-infected PEC cells none none PECs in a dose-dependent manner .
It was also shown that the production of IL-12 p70 by uninfected PECs was augmented by the addition of anti-IL-10 mAb .
These results demonstrate that the inhibition of IL-12 p70 production observed in P. berghei-infected PECs is due to the effect of IL-10 .
This was further confirmed by the addition of rIL-10 to the stimulation culture of PECs ( Fig .
6C ) .
The addition of IL-10 showed the inhibition of IL-12 p70 production and IL-12 p40 mRNA transcription .
In Fig .
4C , it was shown that the culture supernatant of P. berghei-infected PECs inhibited the induction of IL-12 p40 of uninfected PECs .
Therefore , we asked whether the inhibitory activity of the P. berghei-infected PECs was mediated by IL-10 .
As shown in Fig .
6D , the inhibitory activity was neutralized by the addition of anti-IL-10 Ab .
IRF-1 and NF- « B are functioning at comparable level in uninfected and infected PECs We showed that the induction of IL-12 p40 gene by LPS plus IFN-y requires transcription factors IRF-1 and NF- « B ( 18 , 28 ) .
To evaluate whether those two nuclear factors are functioning in PECs of uninfected and infected mice , iNOS gene expression , which also required NF- « B and IRF-1 ( 29 , 30 ) , was first tested by RT-PCR ( Fig .
7A ) .
The gene induction of IL-12 p40 was suppressed in PECs of infected mice .
Using the same reverse transcription prod-uct , we tested the expression of iNOS and IRF-1 mRNA .
iNOS mRNA was expressed at comparable levels in uninfected and infected PECs .
IRF-1 mRNA expression was elevated at comparable levels in both groups of PECs by the induction with LPS plus IFN-y .
These results suggest that the observed inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene induction in infected PECs was not due to the low induction of NF- « B or IRF-1 .
The binding function of NF- « B and IRF-1 at the protein level was confirmed by EMSA ( Fig .
7B ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from uninfected and P. berghei-infected PECs that had been stimulated in vitro for the indicated period with LPS plus IFN-y .
Both extracts exhibited binding activity to the probe for NF-KB , indicating that the stimulation with LPS plus IFN-y induced the activation of NF- « B equally in uninfected and infected PECs .
However , the patterns of the IRF-1 binding were different between infected and uninfected groups .
Small and large molecules bound to the probe for IRF-1 , and both bands disappeared by treatment with anti-IRF-1 Ab ( data not shown ) .
The larger size band appeared in the uninfected group 4 h after stimulation .
In contrast , the larger size band was detected in the infected group even without stimulation .
The intensity of smaller size band was rather stronger in infected group than that in uninfected group .
These results suggest that the IRF-1 might form complex with other molecules and the complex formation was accelerated in P. berghei-infected mice .
Discussion In the present study , we showed that the induction of the IL-12 p40 gene but not the IL-12 p35 gene was strongly inhibited in P. berghei-infected PECs .

Comparable induction of IRF-1 and NF-B in uninfected and infected PECs .
A , PECs of uninfected ( O ) and P. berghei-infected ( @ ) mice were stimulated in vitro with 10 pg/ml LPS plus 100 U/ml IFN-y .
mRNA expression of IL-12 p40 , iNOS , and IRF-1 gene was measured by RT-PCR at the indicated points in time after stimulation .
In this particular experiment , the reverse transcription products of Fig .
3 were used .
Similar patterns were observed in three independent experiments .
B , Nuclear extracts were prepared at the indicated points in time from uninfected and P. berghei-infected PECs after stimulation with LPS plus IFN-y .
Two micro-liters of nuclear extract were incubated with a *°P-labeled DNA probe of NF- « B or IRF-1 binding site in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.6 ) , 50 mM NaCI ] , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , and 5 % glycerol at 25°C for 60 min .
IL-10 produced by PECs from P. berghei-infected mice .
The inhibition was not at the level of activation of NF-KB or IRF-1 transcription factors .
Rather , it is suggested that the inhibition might be at the transcriptional regulation level .
Microorganisms activate macrophages to produce IL-12 .
IL-12 subsequently stimulates NK cells to produce IFN-y , which in turn activates macrophages to stimulate Ag-specific T cells for eradication of microbial pathogens .
In this type of immune response , IL-12 together with IFN-y plays a central role for protection against pathogenic infection .
However , the present study demonstrates that the inducibility of IL-12 p40 gene was inhibited even in the early phase of P. berghei infection .
Although a similar suppression phenomenon in IL-12 gene expression has been reported during measles and Leishmania major infection ( 15 , 16 ) , the mechanism of suppression has yet to be elucidated .
In the present study , it was shown that the PECs of P. berghei-infected mice actively inhibit the gene induction of IL-12 p40 but not IL-12 p35 of uninfected PECs .
These results suggest that the gene expression of IL-12 p40 and IL-12 p35 is differentially regulated in PECs of P. berghei-infected mice .
P. berghei blood-stage parasites grow in erythrocytes and reenter using specific receptors on erythrocytes , and these parasites do not penetrate macrophages ( 31 ) .
However , the above results show that infection with blood-stage parasites influences the gene activation in macrophages .
Recently , it was reported that the Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes bind to dendritic cells and inhibit the function of the dendritic cells ( 32 , 33 ) .
In the present study , soluble factor-mediated interaction between uninfected and infected macrophages was shown to be responsible for the inhibition of IL-12 INHIBITION OF IL-12 p40 IN INFECTED MACROPHAGES p40 gene .
It was observed that the substantial proportion of macrophages were found to bind to and ingested the erythrocytes of the P. berghei-infected mice origin .
The culture supernatant of P. berghei-infected PECs induced the inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene induction in uninfected PECs .
It has been reported that the Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes inhibit the function of dendritic cells by attaching to the cells ( 17 ) .
This information all taken together suggests that macrophages engulf erythrocytes of the P. berghei-infected mice origin subsequently inhibit the other PECs via a soluble factor .
What is the molecule that mediates the inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene expression observed in P. berghei-infected mice ?
It was recently reported that IL-12 production in TGC-elicited PECs could be suppressed by TNF-a ( 34-36 ) .
In the present study , induction of TNF- « gene was comparable in PECs of uninfected and P. berghei-infected mice .
In addition , exogeneous TNF-a did not inhibit the induction of IL-12 p40 mRNA in the present experimental condition ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , TNF-a is not responsible for the inhibition of the IL-12 p40 gene expression in P. berghei-infected PECs .
Controversial reports have been published on the suppressive effect of TGFB on IL-12 gene expression ( 37-39 ) .
However , involvement of TGFB was unlikely in the present study , because TGFB1 was induced at comparable levels in uninfected and infected cells .
In addition , the expression of TGFB2 was one-tenth that of TGFB1 and was strongly inhibited in infected cells .
Therefore , TGFRB did not appeared to be responsible for the inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene expression in infected cells .
IL-10 and PGE , have also been known to suppress IL-12 gene induction ( 7 , 8 , 24 , 25 , 39 ) .
Although the addition of PGE , to the induction culture of PECs inhibited the IL-12 p40 gene expression of uninfected PECs , the in vivo administration of indomethacin , or in vitro treatment of P. berghei-infected PECs with indomethacin , was not capable of neutralizing the inhibition ( data not shown ) , indicating that PGE , is not responsible for the inhibition .
In contrast , the addition of anti-IL-10 mAb was capable of neutralizing the inhibition .
Therefore , IL-10 appears to be the effector molecule that mediates the inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene induction in P. berghei-infected PECs .
Although the addition of anti-IL-10 mAb does not fully neutralize the inhibition observed in P. berghei-infected PECs ( Fig .
6B ) , anti-IL-10 neutralized completely the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of P. berghei-infected PECs ( Fig .
6D ) .
This indicated the possibility that the reactivity of the infected PECs is distinct from that of uninfected PECs .
This suppression may result in the impairment of IFN-y production in the infected mice and may reduce the development of a protective cell-mediated immunity in vivo via a NO-dependent mechanism ( 40 , 41 ) .
We previously showed that the induction of IL-12 p40 gene requires IRF-1 and NF- « B ( 18 , 28 ) .
These two transcription factors are also required for the induction of iNOS gene ( 29 , 30 , 42 , 43 ) .
If the inhibition of the IL-12 p40 gene observed in the present study is due to the low induction of these transcription factors , IRF-1 and NF-KB , the induction of iNOS gene might be also affected by infection .
However , that was not the case .
The iNOS gene was induced at comparable levels in uninfected and infected PECs after stimulation .
NF- « B was equally activated between uninfected and infected PECs at the mRNA and protein level .
In addition , there was no significant difference in the level of IRF-1 gene induction between uninfected and infected PECs at the mRNA level .
However , IRF-1 obtained from infected PECs appeared to form a complex with other proteins in the nuclear extract ( upper band in Fig .
7B ) even at the 0-h time point .
The complex formation might be a regulatory mechanism of IL-12 p40 gene transcription , because similar complex formation was also found in 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology uninfected PECs at the 4-h time point .
It was reported that the IRF-1 interacts with IFN consensus sequence binding protein ( 44 ) .
However , the Ab against IFN consensus sequence binding protein did not interfere with the binding of the complex to the IRF-1 binding sequence in the present study ( data not shown ) .
Taking all theses results together , the low inducibility of the IL-12 p40 gene in infected PECs was not due to the low induction of NF- « B or IRF-1 .
These results instead suggest the possibility that the mechanism of the inhibition might be present at the transcriptional regulation level of the gene .
