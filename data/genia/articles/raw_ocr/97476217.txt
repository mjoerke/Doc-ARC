From the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Environmental Energy Technologies Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 Monochloramine derivatives are long lived physiological oxidants produced by neutrophils during the respiratory burst .
The effects of chemically prepared monochloramine ( NHZ , C ] ) on protein kinase C ( PKC ) and PKC-mediated cellular responses were studied in elicited rat peritoneal neutrophils and human Jurkat T cells .
Neutrophils pretreated with NH , Cl ( 30-50 pum ) showed a marked decrease in the respiratory burst activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which is a potent PKC activator .
These cells , however , were viable and showed a complete respiratory burst upon arachidonic acid stimulation , which induces the respiratory burst by a PKC-independent mechanism .
The NH , Cl-treated neutrophils showed a decrease in both PKC activity and PMA-induced phosphorylation of a 47-kDa protein , which corresponds to the cytosolic factor of NADPH oxidase , p47 '' '' * .
Jurkat T cells pretreated with ( 20-70 um ) showed a decrease in the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor « chain following PMA stimulation .
This was also accompanied by a decrease in both PKC activity and nuclear transcription factor-kB activation , also without loss of cell viability .
These results show that NH , Cl inhibits PKC-mediated cellular responses through inhibition of the inducible PKC activity .
Neutrophils play an important role in the defense against bacterial infections as well as other inflammatory responses .
Many different stimuli activate neutrophils , which show a series of responses such as the respiratory burst , cell shape change , aggregation , degranulation , and phospholipid turnover ( 1 ) .
The respiratory burst is a rapid increase in non-mitochon-drial oxygen consumption , in which large amounts of superoxide anion ( 03 ) are produced by the electron transport complex NADPH oxidase ( 2 , 3 ) .
Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the dismutation of O ; , and HOC ] is formed from H0 , and CI by myeloperoxidase ( 4 , 5 ) .
Chloramines are another type of oxi-dant produced in significant quantities by activated neutrophils ( 6 ) .
They are formed by the non-enzymatic reaction ( I ) of * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant GM27345 .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org HOC with many endogenous amines such as taurine , ammo-nia , lysine , and the amino termini of polypeptides ( 6 , 7 ) .
Taurine is present in neutrophils at 10-20 mx ( 8 ) .
R-NH , + HOCl - > R-NHCI + H , O RrEActioN I Chloramines are less reactive than HOC , and membrane-impermeable chloramines are relatively long lived oxidants ( 9 ) .
Chloramines react preferentially with sulfhydryls and thicethers ( 10 ) , and some chloramines such as monochloramine ( NH , CI1 ) are membrane-permeable ( 11 ) .
Neutrophils in concentrations found in blood ( 2-3 X 10°/ml ) may easily produce 100 M chloramine in a short term culture ( 12 ) .
Moreover , chloramines show distinct biological effects such as inhibition of DNA repair ( 12 ) , inhibition of the generation of macrophage inflammatory mediators ( 13 ) , and detachment of cultured myocytes ( 14 ) .
Recently we showed that membrane-permeable chloramines derived from the respiratory burst are the primary cause of accelerated turnover of glutathione in activated neutrophils ( 15 ) .
Considering these characteristics , chloramines may have signaling functions in inflammation ( 9 ) .
One of the key enzymes of the NADPH oxidase activation is protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( 16 ) .
PKC was originally reported as a ubiquitous , Ca**- and phospholipid-dependent serine/threo-nine kinase , which is activated transiently ( 17 ) .
To date , 12 isoforms of PKC have been reported , and they are classified into three groups , conventional , novel , and atypical , based on their primary structure and cofactor requirement ( 18 , 19 ) .
Neutrophil activation by physiological stimuli such as formyl peptide or complement fragment C5a begins with interaction with their specific surface receptors ( 20 ) .
This interaction leads to the activation of phospholipase C , which generates two second messengers , inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglye-erol .
These messengers together lead to the activation of PKC .
Among the PKC isoforms , PKC is suggested to be responsible for the neutrophil respiratory burst activation ( 21 , 22 ) .
Activated PKC phosphorylates one of the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase , p47_ '' '' * '' ( 23 , 24 ) .
The phosphorylated p47 '' '' * translocates and interacts with membrane component of NADPH oxidase ( 25 , 26 ) , which results in the assembly of the active enzyme .
The tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) induces a PKC-dependent respiratory burst ( 1 , 26 ) .
PMA has a structural similarity with the endogenous PKC agonist diacy1-glycerol and causes a direct and more prolonged activation of * The abbreviations used are : PKC , protein kinase C ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate ; IL-2 , interleukin-2 ; IL-2Ra , interleukin-2 receptor a chain ; NF-kB , nuclear factor « B ; PBS , phosphate-buffered saline ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

PMA effectively activates neutrophil NADPH oxi- dase , and the cells produce maximal amounts of superoxide ( 26 ) .
However , this PKC-mediated activation pathway is not the only way of NADPH oxidase activation .
Some stimuli such as arachidonic acid ( 27 ) or sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ; 28 ) also induce a respiratory burst without requiring PKC ( 29 ) .
Arachidonic acid directly interacts with p47 '' '' '' * , changes its conformation , and enables it to assemble active NADPH oxidase ( 30 ) .
Moreover , arachidonic acid-induced respiratory burst in a cell-free reconstituted system is independent of PKC-cofactors ( Ca®* and ATP ) and is not inhibited by PKC inhibitor ( 29 ) .
Therefore , arachidonic acid is a PKC-independent inducer of respiratory burst .
PKC also has a pivotal role in the activation of T cells .
T cells are stimulated by the interaction of a specific antigen with T cell receptor-CD3 complex .
This interaction activates the intra-cellular kinase cascade ( 31 ) , one of which is mediated by PKC .
Activated kinase cascade activates transcription factors ( 31 ) , which initiate transcription and expression of a variety of molecules including interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and the high affinity IL-2 receptor a chain ( IL-2Ra ) .
Because IL-2 is a major T cell growth factor , the coordinate production of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor is crucial for T cell proliferation and the immune response ( 82 ) .
T cell stimulation with PMA alone is enough for IL-2Ra expression ( 83 ) , and PKCa is responsible for this effect ( 34 ) .
Expression of IL-2Ra « is transcriptionally regulated ( 35 ) and involves nuclear transcription factor ( NF ) - « B activation ( 836 ) .
NF- « B activation comprises the phosphorylation of its inhibitory protein IkB ( 87 ) .
The activated NF-kB translocates from the cy-tosol to the nucleus ( 38 ) , where it binds to the « B consensus sequence of IL-2Ra gene promoter ( 86 ) .
This binding is essential for NF- « B-regulated gene expression ( 39 , 40 ) .
In this study we show that PMA-induced PKC activity is inhibited by NHZCl in neutrophils and Jurkat T cells .
This inhibition of PKC activity results in distinct biological effects , notably inhibition of the respiratory burst in neutrophils and inhibition of IL-2Ra expression in Jurkat T cells .
These results suggest that chloramines may have a physiological function in regions where the respiratory burst is activated .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials PMA , arachidonic acid , and PKCB were obtained from Sigma .
Dul-becco 's phosphate-buffered saline ( Ca**- and Mg**-free , pH 7.4 ; PBS ) and the PKC assay system were from Life Technologies , Inc. NF- « B consensus oligonucleotide was from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .
T4 polynu-cleotide kinase and protein molecular weight markers were from Boeh-ringer Mannheim .
Phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human CD25 ( IL-2Ra ) antibody was from Immunotech ( Westbrook , ME ) .
Calyculin A was from Calbiochem .
[ y-*°P ] JATP and acid were from NEN Life Science Products .
Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human p47 '' * '' ** ( raised against glutathione S-transferase-p47 '' '' ** fusion protein ) was a generous gift from Dr. Bernard M. Babior .
All other reagents were of analytic grade or better .
Cell Preparation Neutrophils-Rat elicited peritoneal neutrophils were prepared from Sprague-Dawley male rats ( 250-350 g , from Bantin and Kingman , Fremont , CA ) as described previously ( 15 , 41 ) .
The collected cells contained about 80 % neutrophils based on microscopic examination , and the cell viability was more than 95 % , which was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test .
Jurkat T Cells-Jurkat T cell is a cell line of human acute T cell leukemia and was obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( clone E6-1 , Bethesda , MD ) .
The cell culture medium was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) fetal bovine serum , 1 % ( w/v ) penicillin-streptomycin , 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate , and 2 mM L-glutamine ( from University of California , San Francisco , cell culture facility ) , and cells were grown in humidified air containing 5 % CO , at 87 °C .
Chloramine Inhibition of Protein Kinase C Chloramine Preparation and Measurement Taurine chloramine and monochloramine ( NHZC1 ) were prepared as described previously ( 15 , 42 ) .
The chloramine concentration was determined by 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate assay ( 42 ) .
Pretreatment of the Cells with Chloramine Neutrophils were suspended in PBS ( 5 X 10° cells/m1 ) , and NHC !
or taurine chloramine was added to get the final concentration of 10-70 uM .
After the incubation for 10 min at 37 °C , neutrophils were separated from the PBS by centrifugation and used as described below .
Jurkat T cells were suspended in the fresh cell culture medium ( 1 x 10° cells/m1 ) , and NHC !
was added to 20-70 uM .
In contrast to PBS , this medium alone consumed added NH , Cl .
After the incubation for 80 min at 87 °C , Jurkat T cells were used without washing because the medium contained no more detectable chloramine .
Measurement of the Respiratory Burst Neutrophils were resuspended in the assay mixture ( 1.25 X 10° cells/ml , 1.1 mM p-hydroxyphenylacetate , 50 ug/ml superoxide dis-mutase , 50 ug/ml horseradish peroxidase , in PBS ) , and they were stimulated with either PMA ( 800 nM , final concentration ) or arachidonic acid ( 100 uM ) , which was previously dissolved in ethanol at 300 uM and 100 mM , respectively .
Preliminary study showed that these concentrations were optimal .
The respiratory burst was monitored continuously at 37 °C by H , O , formation as described previously ( 15 , 43 ) .
Measurements of PKC Activity PKC activity was measured just after the chloramine exposure using a PKC assay system from Life Technologies , Inc .
Partial purification with an anion exchange column was omitted because a preliminary study using crude and partially purified samples showed similar re-sults .
Acetylated synthetic peptide from myelin basic protein 4-14 ( Ac-GIn-Lys-Arg-Pro-Ser-Gin-Arg-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu ) was used for the substrate , which is specific for conventional PKCs ( 44 ) .
Specificity for PKC was established by running the control sample using PKC-specific inhibitor peptide PKC ( 19-86 ) ( 45 ) for each sample .
PKC activity was expressed as pmol of `` °P incorporated/min/10® cells .
Phosphorylation of 47-kDa Protein Phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein in neutrophils was studied as described previously ( 46 ) , except for the following .
Before NH , Cl treatment , neutrophils ( 1 X 10*/ml ) were incubated with [ *Plorthophospho-ric acid ( 500 mCi/ml ) at 30 °C for 30 min in 188 mM NaCl , 2.7 mM KCl , and 7.5 mM D-glucose , adjusted to pH 7.5 .
After the incubation , neutrophils ( 5 X 10®/ml ) were added to 830-70 uM NH , Cl in PBS and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C .
Then the cells were stimulated with 300 nm PMA for 90 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid ( 10 % w/v ) , centrifuged , and the total precipitated protein was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer .
The pH was adjusted to about 7 by NaOH .
Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 7.5 % gel , stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 , and dried , and autoradiography was performed .
Phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein was also studied in the cell-free system using exogenous PKCB .
Cytosolic fractions were prepared from NHC !
( 50 pM ) -treated and control neutrophils as described previously ( 47 ) .
Then p47 '' '' ** was partially purified by passing through a DE52 ion exchange column as described previously ( 48 ) .
Immunoblot analysis showed that virtually all immunoreactive p47 '' '' * was recovered from the pass-through fraction .
The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mg/ml partially purified protein , 5 units/ml PKCB , 0.3 % ( w/v ) Triton X-100 mixed micelles containing 10 uM PMA , and 0.28 mg/ml phos-phatidylserine ( prepared as described in Ref .
49 ) , 20 mM MgCl , , 1 mM CaCl , , 20 uM ATP ( containing 100 pCi/ml [ y-* '' P ] JATP ) , and 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , incubated at 30°C for 7 min .
The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1 pM staurosporine and 1 mM ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography .
Immunoblot analysis of p47 '' '' ** was performed following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-p47 '' '' '' * antibody .
The optical density of the autoradiogram and immunoblot was measured by a Shimadzu CS-9301 PC densitometer and expressed as percent of positive control .
Measurements of IL-2Ra Expression After 30 min of NH , Cl incubation , Jurkat T cells were stimulated with PMA ( 100 nM ) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide .
Control cells were treated with the same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide ( 0.1 % v/v ) without PMA .

RESULTS Effects of Chloramine Pretreatment on the Neutrophil Respiratory Burst-Under resting conditions , rat peritoneal neutrophils showed no detectable respiratory burst , as measured by H,0 , production .
When cells were stimulated with PMA , which is a potent PKC activator , they showed a marked respiratory burst , whose rate was maximal for several minutes ( 15 ) .
The PMA-induced respiratory burst was inhibited significantly at 30 um NH , Cl pretreatment , and it was abolished at 50 uM NHC ] pretreatment ( Fig .
1 ) .
In contrast , the neutrophils pretreated with 30-50 um NHCl showed a complete respiratory burst when stimulated with arachidonic acid , which is a PKC-independent stimulant .
In the control cells , the maximal rate of H , O , production by arachidonic acid stimulation was lower than that which occurred by PMA stimulation ( Fig .
1 ) .
This is not surprising because different stimuli cause a different degree of respiratory burst even at optimal conditions ( 26 ) .
Membrane-impermeable taurine chloramine at 50 ux had no inhibitory effects on the PMA-induced respiratory burst .
At a higher NHC ] concentration ( 70 uM ) the arachidonic acid-induced respiratory burst was also inhibited ( data not shown ) .
To assess whether the respiratory burst suppression by NHC ] was caused by neutrophil death , cell viability was eval- 26249 TaBLE I Cell viability after NH , Cl treatment Neutrophils ( 5 X 10° cells/ml ) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of NHC !

Control cells showed 96 % viability .
Neutrophils treated with up to 50 um NHZ , Cl showed more than 95 % viability , not significantly different from the controls .
Therefore , the suppression of PMA-induced respiratory burst by NHZ , Cl was not caused by neutrophil death .
PKC Activity in Neutrophils-Because PMA induces a respiratory burst by a PKC-dependent mecha-nism , we measured the inducible PKC activity in the pretreated neutrophils .
The inducible PKC activity decreased in the NH , Cl-pretreated neutrophils ( Fig .
2 ) .
Neutrophils treated with 50 um NHC ] resulted in the PKC activity being decreased to 47 % of the control cells under maximal activation .
Taurine chloramine at 50 um showed no inhibition of the respiratory burst and no inhibitory effects on PKC .
Phosphorylation of the 47-kDa Protein in NH , Cl-pretreated Neutrophils-PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of p47_ '' '' * is essential for the PMA-induced respiratory burst ( 54 ) .
The phosphorylation was assessed by detecting the °°P incorporation into 47-kDa protein in the whole cell system .
Anti-human p47 '' '' '' * antibody reacted with a protein at this position .
Although resting neutrophils did not show an apparent °°P incorporation into 47-kDa protein , PMA stimulation of the control cells resulted in a distinct °°P incorporation ( Fig .
3 ) , and this is consistent with similar studies with guinea pig neutrophils ( 46 ) .
Monochloramine-pretreated neutrophils showed a decrease in the phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein upon PMA stimulation .
Pretreatment with 50 um resulted in marked decrease in °°P incorporation ( Fig .
3 ) .
Neutrophils pretreated with 30 um NHCl showed a lower phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein than control cells ( Fig .
3 ) , despite the statistically insignificant decrease in PKC activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
These results were consistent with the significant decrease in respiratory burst activity in these cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
The phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein was also studied in a cell-free system using exogenous PKC , to study if NH , Cl damaged p47 '' '' '' * so that it could not be phosphorylated by PKC .
The 47-kDa protein from ( 50 unt ) -treated and the control cells were equally well phosphorylated by exogenous PKC ( Fig .
4A ) .
Immunoblot analysis showed that these two samples contained comparable amounts of immunoreactive pATP '' * ( Fig .
4B ) .
Suppression of IL-2Ra Expression in NH , Cl-pretreated Jurkat T Cells-To study whether the effect of on PKC is limited to neutrophils or whether it is a more general phenomenon involving other cell types , we studied the effect of on the PMA-induced IL-2Ra « expression in Jurkat T cells .
Un-stimulated Jurkat T cells showed almost no IL-2Ra expression , but 24 h after PMA stimulation IL-2Ra expression was markedly enhanced .

PKC Activity in NH , Cl-treated Jurkat T Cells-To correlate the IL-2Ra expression with the inhibition of PKC activation , we measured the inducible PKC activity in Jurkat T cells .
Fig .
6 demonstrates that 20-70 um inhibited inducible PKC activity in Jurkat T cells .
Because the cell viability did not change ( Table I ) , this inhibition of PKC activation was not the result of cell death .
NF- « B Activation-The PMA-induced IL-2Ra expression is a multistep response involving kinase cascade activation , NF- « B activation , mRNA synthesis , and protein synthesis ( 35 , 38 ) .
We studied activation to see if the inhibited PKC activity fails to activate the step after PKC activation .
NF- « B activation precedes IL-2Ra expression in Jurkat T cells ( 36 ) .
Consistent with previous reports ( 40 , 55 ) , PMA induced marked activation of NF- « B in Jurkat T cells .
Pretreatment of Jurkat T cells with NHC ] inhibited PMA-induced NF- « B activation ( Fig .

The inhibition of IL-2Ra expression , NF- « B activation , and PKC activation by NHgCl all occurred at similar ( 20-70 um ) NH , CI concentrations ( Figs .

Calyculin A treatment efficiently induced NF-B activation in both the NHCl-pretreated and the control cells ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION When neutrophils were pretreated with 50 um NHZCl , the PKC-dependent stimulant PMA could not induce respiratory burst , yet the PKC-independent stimulant arachidonic acid induced a complete respiratory burst .

oxidase .
Indeed , treatment resulted in a decrease in the inducible PKC activity in neutrophils .
Membrane-impermeable taurine chloramine at 50 uM had no inhibitory effect on either the respiratory burst or the PKC activity .
This suggests that the target for chloramine was not located on the outer cell membrane .
PKC activity is one of the rate-limiting factors of the respiratory burst activity .
It has been reported that the neutrophil respiratory burst correlates directly with the intra-cellular level of PKC ( 56 ) .
Moreover , PKC inhibitors such as staurosporine and H-7 inhibit both phosphorylation of 47-kDa protein and superoxide production in a dose-dependent manner ( 57 ) .
Therefore , the inhibition of inducible PKC activity appears to be the cause of inhibition of PMA-induced respiratory burst in NHCl-pretreated cells .
Neutrophils pretreated with 50 um NH , Cl showed virtually no respiratory burst upon PMA stimulation but still possessed 47 % of their PKC activity .
Phosphorylation of p47 '' '' '' * is a 26251 requirement of PMA-stimulated respiratory burst activation ( 54 ) .
We measured the phosphorylation of protein of 47-kDa molecular mass .
Antibodies against human p47 '' '' '' * reacted with a protein at this position .
After a 50 um NHZCl pretreatment , neutrophils showed a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein , despite the remaining PKC activity .
This result suggests that the phosphorylation of p47P '' * was decreased in the NHCl-treated neutrophils , which results in the inhibition of the respiratory burst .
We further studied if NHC ] directly damaged p47 '' '' ** so that it could not be phosphorylated by PKC .
In a cell-free system , exogenously added PKC phosphorylated equally well the 47-kDa protein from the control and neutrophils .
Both samples contained comparable amounts of immunoreactive p47° '' °* .
This result suggests that even after NHgCl ( 50 un ) treatment , p47 '' '' * can be phosphorylated when catalyzed by intact PKC .
Therefore , the decrease in the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein appears to be caused by the decrease in the PKC activity in neutrophils .
One explanation for the discrepancy between the 47-kDa protein phosphorylation and the remaining PKC activity is that neutrophils contain phosphoprotein phosphatases that reverse the action of PKC ( 58 , 59 ) .
During the PMA-stimulated respiratory burst , p47 '' '' '' * undergoes a continual cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation ( 60 ) .
Under optimally stimulated conditions the phosphorylation reaction by PKC pre-dominates , which maintains the p47 '' '' * in a phosphorylated state ( 60 ) and keeps the NADPH oxidase in the active state .
Therefore , if PKC activity decreases , the dephosphorylation reaction by phosphatase may predominate , and p47 '' '' * can not be maintained in a sufficiently phosphorylated state .
Another possible explanation is that may alter the substrate specificity of PKC .
In this case , the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of p47° '' °* may be impaired more severely than that of myelin basic protein peptide .
This possibility should be studied further .
In any case , it is likely that the remaining PKC activity was insufficient to keep the p47 '' '' * phosphorylated enough to allow assembly of an active NADPH oxidase .
This would result in the observed substantial inhibition of the respiratory burst activity .
Monochloramine-induced suppression of inducible PKC activity was not restricted to neutrophils .
At 20 um , NHCIl inhibited the PMA-induced IL-2Ra expression , PKC activation , and the NF- « B activation in Jurkat T cells .
Although there are many steps that could result in the inhibition of IL-2Ra expression , we measured NF-kB activation because NF-KB is activated by the phosphorylation of its inhibitory protein IB ( 37 ) , and NF- « B activation precedes IL-2Ra gene expression in Jurkat T cells ( 38 ) .
The inhibition of PKC activation and NF- « B activation occurred at similar concentrations of which suggests that the inhibited PKC activity failed to activate NF-xB .
We studied further if the decrease in NF- « B activation was the result of direct damage of NF- « B protein caused by NHCl .
Calyculin A is a potent inhibitor of phosphoprotein phosphatase types 1 and 2A , and it activates NF- « B through IxB phosphorylation and degradation in Jurkat T cells ( 61 ) .
Monochloramine treatment ( 50 un ) did not affect the calyculin A-induced NF- « B activation .
This result showed that NF-kB in NH , Cl-treated Jurkat T cells was still inducible and suggests that NF- « B protein was not a direct target of NHCl .
Because the NF- « B activation is reported to regulate IL-2Ra gene expression in Jurkat T cells ( 38 ) , inhibition of PKC activation by NH , Cl seems to be the primary cause of the inhibition of IL-2Ra expression .
Among the PKC isoforms , at least conventional types of PKCs ( a , BL , II , and y ) are likely to be the target of NHCI .
In 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 26252 the neutrophils , PKC appears to be responsible for NADPH oxidase activation because PKC migrates to the membrane fraction upon stimulation ( 21 ) and is able to phosphorylate p47ph°x ( 22 ) .
Although T cells contain both PKCa and PKC as well as other PKCs ( 81 ) , PKCa has been suggested to be responsible for IL-2Ra expression ( 34 ) .
We used a synthetic myelin basic protein peptide as a substrate for the measurement of PKC activity .
This peptide is a good substrate for conventional PKCs but not for novel or atypical PKCs ( 44 ) .
However , it is yet to be resolved whether chloramines also affect novel and/or atypical PKCs .
During the respiratory burst , a variety of chloramine derivatives are detected in the extracellular medium ( 7 ) .
These chloramines are mostly hydrophilic , low molecular weight , mono-N-chloramine derivatives ( 7 ) and not likely to be mem-brane-permeable .
However , membrane-permeable chloramines are also likely to be produced because normal human plasma contains 20-40 um NH } ( 62 ) .
When 2-3 x 10°/ml of neutrophils , which is comparable to the concentration in blood , are activated with PMA , the chloramine concentration reaches as high as 100 uM in a short term culture ( 12 ) .
As the neutrophil concentration can be much higher in inflammatory sites , our chloramine concentration ( 20-70 uM ) may well be physiologi-cally attainable .
Membrane-impermeable chloramines are long lived with an apparent half-life of about 18 h in vitro ( 9 ) .
These chloramines can migrate from their origin to the adjacent or even distant tissues .
Moreover , these chloramines react with NH } to yield the membrane-permeable NH , Cl ( 7 ) .
The plasma NHJ concentration increases substantially in some human conditions such as liver failure ( 63 ) .
Such conditions may be favorable for NHZCl production .
We showed in this work that inhibited PKC-dependent activation both in neutrophils and Jurkat T cells .
PKC , functionally impaired by chloramine , was not sufficiently activated upon PMA stimulation , resulting in suppression of PKC-mediated cellular responses .
Considering the central importance of PKC in cellular signaling pathways , respiratory burst-derived chloramines may function as signal modulating molecules in regions where neutrophils exhibit respiratory burst .
