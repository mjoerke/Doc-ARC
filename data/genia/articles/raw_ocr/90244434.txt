6 Human Immunodeficiency Virus vpr Product Is a Virion-Associated Regulatory Protein ERIC A. COHEN , * GHASSAN DEHNI , JOSEPH G. SODROSKI , anp WILLIAM A. HASELTINE Division of Human Retrovirology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Department of Pathology , Harvard Medical School , 44 Binney Street , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Received 4 January 1990/Accepted 5 March 1990 The vpr product of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) acts in frans to accelerate virus replication and cytopathic effect in T cells .
Here it is shown that the HIV-1 viral particle contains multiple copies of the vypr protein .
The vpr product is the first regulatory protein of HIV-1 to be found in the virus particle .
This observation raises the possibility that vpr acts to facilitate the early steps of infection before de novo viral protein synthesis occurs .
The gag , pol , and env genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) encode the structural and replicative proteins that are incorporated into the virus particle .
HIV-1 specifies at least six additional proteins which regulate viral replication ( Fig .
1 ) .
Two of these genes , tat and rev , are essential for virus replication .
The remaining genes , nef , vif , vpu , and vpr , are not required for virus replication , although mutations in these genes alter the replication properties of the virus ( 3 ) .
vpr was recently demonstrated to accelerate the replication and the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 in CD4* T cells ( 2 , 5 ) .
vpr was also shown to specify a 15-kilodalton ( kDa ) protein that acts in frans to increase expression of viral proteins .
vpr also stimulates expression of heterologous genes driven by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) as well as other promoters ( 2 ) .
To determine whether the vpr protein is incorporated into the virus particle , CD4*® T cells were transfected with infectious proviruses isogenic except for the expression of vpr .
Cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran technique ( 8 ) .
The provirus that expresses the full-length vpr protein of 96 amino acids is designated HXBRU * .
A provirus isogenic except for a frameshift mutation in vpr that is predicted to terminate the product at amino acid 40 was used as a control ( HXBRU~ ) ( 2 ) .
Eight days posttransfection , both cultures were metabol-ically labeled with 100 wCi of [ **S ) Jcysteine per ml for 8 h as described elsewhere ( 9 ) .
Cells were collected by centrifuga-tion , washed once with phosphate-buffered saline , and lysed with 750 pl of a buffer which contained 0.05 M Tris hydro-chloride ( pH 7.0 ) , 0.15 M NaCl , 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , and 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate .
The medium containing the virus particle was centrifuged at 800 x g and passed through a 0.22-wm-pore-size filter to prevent cell contamination of the supernatant .
Cell-free supernatants were then centrifuged for 1 h at 16,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge .
Lysates were prepared from both the labeled transfected cells and from the virus peliets .
The cell and viral lysates were immunoprecipitated as described previously ( 9 ) with antiserum from a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) which recognized a broad spectrum of viral structural proteins .
The lysates were also precipitated with a monospecific anti-vpr serum .
The rabbit vpr antiserum used was raised against a synthetic peptide correspond * Corresponding author .
3097 ing to the amino-terminal 19 amino acids of the vpr protein .
As described previously ( 2 ) , this antiserum recognizes a 15-kDa protein in cells producing the vpr protein ( Fig .
2A , lane 1 ) .
The peptide used to raise the antiserum competed for recognition of the 15-kDa protein ( lane 2 ) .
The vpr product was not detected in cells producing the HXBRU~ virus ( lane 4 ) .
The vpr peptide antiserum also recognized the 15-kDa protein in the lysates of pelleted virus prepared from cells producing the HXBRU* virus ( Fig .
2B , lane 1 ) .
No vpr product was detected in viruses pelleted from cultures producing the HXBRU~ virus ( Fig .
2B , lane 3 ) .
In addition , a protein of approximately 9 kDa of molecular mass was detected only in viruses pelleted from cultures producing the HXBRU* and HXBRU~ viruses with both the vpr peptide antiserum and the AIDS patient serum ( Fig .
2B , lanes 1 to 4 ) .
The recognition of this 9-kDa protein was not competed for by the vpr peptide , suggesting a nonspecific reaction ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the vpr protein is associated with the virus particle .

Detection of the vpr product in the extracellular virions .
( A ) Lysates prepared from [ *SJcysteine-labeled Jurkat cells transfected with either HXBRU * ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or HXBRU~ ( lanes 4 to 6 ) provirus were immunoprecipitated with vpr peptide antiserum ( lanes 1 and 4 ) , vpr peptide antiserum preincubated with 500 wmol of peptide ( lanes 2 and 5 ) , or AIDS patient serum ( lanes 3 and 6 ) .
( B ) Lysates of pelleted virus prepared from Jurkat cells transfected with either HXBRU* ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or HXBRU~ ( lanes 3 and 4 ) provirus were immunoprecipitated with vpr peptide antiserum ( lanes 1 and 3 ) or AIDS patient serum ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
( C ) Pelieted virions prepared from [ *S ] cysteine-labeled HXBRU *-transfected Jurkat cells were suspended in 400 pl of TNE , layered on a 15 to 60 % ( wt/vol ) sucrose gradient , and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 3 h as described previously ( 1 ) .
Eleven fractions ( 400 pl each ) were collected .
Reverse transcriptase assays ( 7 ) were performed on 50-pl portions of each fraction ( & ) .
Ten microliters of each fraction was counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine the amount of [ **S ] cysteine-labeled proteins ( @ ) .

64 , 1990 be specific , since in similar experiments using this and other proviruses , monospecific antiserum to the fat , rev , vpu , and nef proteins did not detect these proteins in the pelleted fraction of the viruses ( data not shown ) .
To rule out cell contamination in the supernatant , the suspended HXBRU * virus pellet was layered onto a sucrose gradient as described previously ( 1 ) .
The virus was suspended in 400 pl of a buffer ( TNE ) which contained Tris ( 10 mM ; pH 7.4 ) , 100 mM NaCl , and 1 mM EDTA .
A 4-mi linear sucrose gradient ( 15 to 60 % , wt/vol ) spun at 45,000 rpm for 3 h was used .
Eleven fractions of 400 ul each were collected .
The amount of [ °°S ) Jcysteine-labeled protein in each fraction and the reverse transcriptase activity were determined ( Fig .
2C ) ( 7 ) .
Additionally , each fraction was precipitated with either an AIDS patient antiserum or the monospecific vpr antiserum ( Fig .
2D ) .
The vpr protein cosedimented with virus particles by all measures used ( Fig .
2C and D ) .
The peak of vpr protein corresponds to the peak of reverse transcriptase activity , the peak of [ **SJcysteine-labeled proteins in the gradient , and the peak of virion proteins as detected by AIDS patient antiserum .
The amount of radioactivity in the bands corresponding to p24 , p17 , and vpr p15 protein in the immunoprecipitates of cell lysates and virus particles was determined .
The results showed that the ratios of the proteins associated with the viral particles and the cells were roughly equivalent , between 5:1 and 10:1 ( data not shown ) .
Although it is difficult to calculate stoichiometry from such measurements because the efficiency of immunoprecipitation may vary for each protein , the results indicate that multiple vpr proteins were incorporated into each virion .
The results of these experiments demonstrate that the vpr protein is incorporated into cell-free virus particles .
The vpr protein is the first regulatory product of HIV-1 to be found associated with viral particles .
Experiments similar to these failed to detect the fat , rev , vpu , or nef protein associated with virus particles ( E. A. Cohen , J. G. Sodroski , and W. A. Haseltine , unpublished observations ) .
The vpx protein of HIV type 2 and of the simian immunodeficiency virus was also recently reported to be associated with the virus particles ( 12 ) .
There is no similarity in amino acid sequence between the vpr and vpx proteins .
The mechanism by which vpr becomes associated with the virus particle is unknown .
Other capsid proteins are made as gag or gag-pol precursors and assembled as units into the budding particle ( 4 , 11 ) .
The vpr protein is not known to be part of such a larger precursor and must have an independent means of association with the nascent particle .
The presence of a transactivating protein in the mature virus particles suggests that this protein plays a role in early steps of virus infection .
Possible roles for such a protein include facilitation of the reverse transcription reaction , stabilization of RNA , stabilization of RNA-DNA or DNA-DNA structures , facilitated migration of the proviral DNA to the nucleus , and facilitated integration .
The ability of the vpr protein to increase the rate of expression of the HIV-1 and other promoters raises the possibility that the virion-associated vpr may activate early transcription of the HIV-1 NOTES 3099 provirus .
The vpr product may also alter cellular expression before viral RNA transcription begins .
Alteration of the cell environment by vpr carried into the cell by the infecting virus may alter the initial rate of HIV-1 RNA accumulation before viral proteins are made de novo .
