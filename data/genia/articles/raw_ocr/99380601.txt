Witte , University of California , Los Angeles , CA , June 25 , 1999 ( received for review May 17 , 1999 ) ABSTRACT AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( AIDS NHL ) comprises a diverse and heterogeneous group of high-grade B cell tumors .
Certain classes of AIDS NHL are associated with alterations in oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes or infections by oncogenic herpesviruses .
However , the clinically significant class of AIDS NHL designated immunoblastic lymphoma plasmacytoid ( AIDS IBLP ) lacks any consistent genetic alterations .
We identified the TCLI oncogene from a set of AIDS IBLP-associated cDNA fragments generated by subtractive hybridization with non-AIDS IBLP .
Aberrant TCL1 expression has been implicated in T cell leukemia/lymphoma development , and its expression also has been seen in many established B cell tumor lines .
However , TCLI expression has not been reported in AIDS NHL .
We find that TCL1 is expressed in the majority of AIDS IBLP tumors examined .
TCL1 protein expression is restricted to tumor cells in AIDS IBLP tissue samples analyzed with immunohistochemical staining .
Hyperplastic lymph node and tonsil also exhibit strong TCL1 protein expression in mantle zone B cells and in rare interfollicular zone cells , whereas follicle-center B cells ( centroblasts and centrocytes ) show weaker expression .
These results establish TCLJ as the most prevalent of all of the surveyed oncogenes associated with AIDS IBLP .
They also indicate that abundant TCL1 expression in quiescent mantle zone B cells is down-regulated in activated germinal center follicular B cells in parallel to the known expression pattern of BCL-2 .
High-level expression in nonproliferating B cells suggests that TCL1 may function in protecting naive preac-tivated B cells from apoptosis .
AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( AIDS NHL ) occurs in up to 10 % of HIV-infected individuals who have moderate to severe immunodeficiency ( 1-3 ) .
These lymphomas are biologically and genetically heterogeneous , are derived from germinal center or postgerminal center B cells , and are classified according to body location and histologic criteria ( reviewed in refs .
4-7 ) .
Certain AIDS NHL classes are associated with specific oncogenic lesions or viral involvement .
For example , AIDS-related Burkitt 's lymphoma usually contain activating c-MYC translocations , whereas AIDS-related pri-mary-effusion lymphoma consistently contain human herpesvirus-8 ( 8-24 ) .
AIDS diffuse large B cell lymphoma accounts for 70 % of systemic lymphomas and is the second most common type of cancer after Kaposi 's sarcoma in AIDS patients ( 25 , 26 ) .
Systemic AIDS diffuse large B cell lymphoma are further classified into two subclasses ( 6 , 7 , 27-29 ) .

9809 expression of the BCL-6 protooncogene because of chromosomal translocations or promoter mutations .
AIDS immunoblastic lymphoma plasmacytoid ( AIDS IBLP ) is thought to derive from postgerminal center B cells and is not associated with any predominant genetic alteration ( 30 , 31 ) .
AIDS IBLP are monoclonal tumors that usually contain Epstein-Barr virus , indicating that they are not simply Epstein-Barr virus-driven polyclonal proliferations .
The lack of any consistently associated oncogene involvement in AIDS IBLP strongly suggests that these tumors arise through novel patterns of dysregulated gene expression ( 7 , 15 , 32 ) .
We sought to identify differentially expressed genes in AIDS IBLP patient samples versus non-AIDS lymphoma samples by using suppression subtractive hybridizations ( SSH ) ( 33 , 34 ) .
Large cell lymphomas with immunoblastic/plasmacytoid features consistent with postgerminal center derivations ( IBLP ) were selected for these subtractions from HIV-infected or uninfected patient samples .
The TCLI oncogene was identified among multiple differentially expressed genes isolated from AIDS IBLP in these studies .
TCL1 is developmentally regulated and is normally expressed in fetal thymocytes , in bone marrow pre-B and immature B cells , and weakly in CD19* peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 40 , 41 ) .
Abnormal TCLI expression caused by chromosomal translocations or inversions near T cell receptor-enhancer elements have been previously demonstrated in T cell leukemia/lymphoma ( 35-39 ) .
Continuous tissue-specific expression of TCL ] also caused transgenic mice to develop a polyclonal T cell expansion with subsequent progression to T cell leukemia ( 40 ) .
Widely variable levels of TCL1 expression have been reported in many established B lymphoblastoid and B cell tumor lines .
The combined results of several studies showed that most immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines ( 10/12 ) as well as B cell tumor lines established from acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 15/18 ) , Burkitt 's lymphoma ( 9/11 ) , and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( 8/9 ) expressed TCL1 ( 40-42 ) .
TCL1 expression was not detected in myeloma cell lines ( 0/9 ) .
In contrast to these findings on cell lines , TCLI expression has not been reported in primary B lymphoid tumors , including AIDS-related B cell malignancies .
Comparison of the levels of TCL1 protein expression in AIDS IBLP samples with the normal pattern of expression in hyperplastic lymph node ( HYP ) suggests that TCLI is aberrantly regulated and over-expressed in many AIDS IBLP tumors .
Up-regulation of TCL I in AIDS IBLP can not occur by the same chromosomal alterations involved in T cell leukemia/lymphoma because the T cell receptor loci are transcriptionally silent in normal and malignant B cells .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient Samples , cDNA Manufacture , and Subtractions .
Fresh-frozen patient samples were derived from HIV-infected and uninfected individuals ( Table 1 ) .
These tissues are part of a catalogued bank of 750 AIDS-associated malignancies and related non-AIDS tissue samples maintained at UCLA .
Eighty of the AIDS NHL samples in this bank have been extensively characterized for known oncogenes , tumor-suppressor genes , and viral involvement .
Subtraction sample AIDS IBLP 1 was chosen from these characterized tumor samples based on the demonstrated absence of Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus-8 and the lack of oncogenic mutations or alterations in p53 , RAS , c-MYC , BCL-2 , or BCL-6 ( 19 , 43-46 ) .
AIDS IBLP , non-AIDS IBLP , and HYP samples were examined histologically , and tissue blocks were trimmed to exclude areas of necrosis or surrounding non-lymphoid tissues .
Microtome sections ( 5-10 um ) were placed directly into 5 ml of RNA STAT-60 for total RNA extraction ( Tel-Test , Friendswood , TX ) .
cDNA was synthesized from 0.4 ug of total RNA ( Superscript II , GIBCO/BRL ) by using a Smart PCR cDNA Synthesis kit and then PCR-amplified 17-19 cycles by using conditions recommended by the manufacturer ( CLONTECH ) ( 34 ) .
SSH were performed between AIDS IBLP 1 versus HYP 1 or non-AIDS IBLP 1 by using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction kit ( CLONTECH ) ( 33 ) .
Subtracted gene fragments were cloned into the TA cloning vector ( Invitrogen ) and transformed into DHS « Escherichia coli .
White colonies containing gene inserts were selected by isopropyl-B-D-thiogalactoside/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-B-D-galactoside screening and seeded into 96-well microtiter plates for growth with antibiotic selection .
Miniarray Filter Preparation , Hybridization , and Analyses .
Samples of bacterial culture lysates in 96-well plates were stamped with a replicating tool ( V & P Scientific , San Diego , CA ) into fresh 96-well Thermowell plates ( Costar ) for PCR amplification of cDNA inserts .
PCR was performed for 30 cycles ( 94°C for 30 s , 68°C for 3 min ) , and the average size of insert fragments was ~1 kilobase .
These PCR products were identically stamped onto quadruplicate NitroPlus nitrocellulose filters ( Micron Separations ) .
The first position on each filter was stamped with an 850-bp Psfl fragment of the plant Lemna gibba RuBPCase gene .
The filters were denatured and neutralized for 5 min , followed by baking at 80°C for 1 h. Random-primed , radiolabeled probes were made by using a Table 1 .

Lymphomas with p53 mutations in exons 5 , 6 , and/or 7 terminate translation early or contain frameshift mutations .
These five tumors also contain loss-of-heterozygosity ( LOH ) alterations in the non-mutated alleles .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) Prime-it II kit ( Stratagene ) from 50 ng of unsubtracted or subtracted cDNA .
Probes were spiked with 0.3 ng of the 850-bp RuBPCase gene fragment before radiolabeling to allow semi-quantitative comparisons of hybridization intensities between filters .
Hybridizations were performed at 42°C for 18 h , and filters were washed with 0.1 % SSC/0.1 % SDS for 45 min at 52°C .
Hybridization signals were determined visually by auto-radiography and quantitatively with a PhosphorImager ( Mo-lecular Dynamics ) by using the program IMAGEQUANT .
`` Virtual '' Northern Analyses of Tissues .
PCR-amplified cDNA ( 0.5 ug ) , obtained from equivalent amounts of reverse-transcribed total RNA , was fractionated in a 1 % agarose gel and alkaline-transferred for 1 hr to a MagnaCharge nylon membrane by using a TurboBlotter ( Schleicher and Schuell ) .
The blots were hybridized with random-primed , radiolabeled TCL1 or BCA-1 cDNA fragment probes .
Equal lane loading was determined by ethidium bromide staining ( data not shown ) .
Immunohistochemical Staining of TCL1 and Fascin in Tissues .
Rabbit antisera were generated against a purified glutathione S-transferase-TCL1 fusion protein ( data not shown ) .
Formalin-fixed tissues on glass slides were incubated with blocking buffer and subsequently with TCL1 antisera .
Slides were rinsed , and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ig ( DAKO ) was added .
Slides were washed , and streptavidin was added , followed by diaminobenzidine HCl incubation and counterstaining in Mayer 's hematoxylin ( DAKO ) .
Formalin-fixed tissue sections were also stained with a fascin mAb to detect dendritic reticulum cells ( DRC ) as described ( 47 , 48 ) .
RESULTS Identification of TCL1 and BCA-1 in Fresh-Frozen Patient Samples .
Two independent bidirectional SSH were performed to identify AIDS lymphoma-expressed genes .
In the first subtraction , AIDS IBLP 1 cDNA was paired with HYP 1 cDNA and in the second , this AIDS IBLP sample was paired with non-AIDS IBLP 1 cDNA ( Table 1 ) .
The first subtraction reduced genes that were transiently up- or down-regulated because of immune system activation as often occurs in premalignant persistent generalized lymphadenopathy in early HIV infection ( 4 , 49 ) .
The second subtraction removed cDNAs expressed in common between two lymphomas of the same histologic type and enriched for up- or down-regulated sequences in severely immunosuppressed individuals .
Over 2,000 cloned cDNA fragments from these subtractions were arrayed on nitrocellulose filters and independently hybridized with tester , driver , and subtracted cDNA probes ( data not shown ) .
Approximately 120 of the clones that differentially hybridized were sequenced .
TCLI , an oncogene implicated in T cell leukemia/lymphoma development , and BCA-1 , a recently identified B cell CXC-family chemoattractant , were identified in these characterized isolates and were differentially expressed in opposite directions ( 40 , 50 , 51 ) .
TCL1I was identified in the AIDS IBLP 1 minus non-AIDS IBLP 1 subtraction , whereas BCA-1 was found in both HYP 1 and non-AIDS IBLP 1 minus AIDS IBLP 1 subtractions ( data not shown ) .
Differential Expression Profiles of TCL1 and BCA-1 .
Northern blots to confirm the differential expression of TCLLI and BCA-1 were not possible because of the exceptionally small sizes of the tissue samples used in this study .
Therefore , virtual Northern analyses were performed on PCR-amplified cDNA from tissue samples ( Fig .
1 ) .
TCL1I was abundantly expressed in AIDS IBLP samples 1 and 2 ( which both lack known genetic lesions or viral involvement ) but was absent in non-AIDS IBLP samples 1 and 2 .
Low levels of TCLI were detected in HYP samples from HIV-infected and uninfected individuals .
In contrast to TCL1 , BCA-1 was highly expressed in HYP samples 1 and 2 as well as in non-AIDS IBLP 1 but was absent in non-lymph node-derived tumors as well as lymph node-derived Medical Sciences : Teitell et al .

TCL1 Protein Is Expressed in Distinct Locations in AIDS IBLP , HYP , and Tonsil .
Tissue-localization studies were performed to definitively identify the cell types expressing TCLI and BCA-1 in AIDS IBLP and non-AIDS IBLP tumor samples .
TCL1 rabbit antisera staining of formalin-fixed lymphoma tissues demonstrated intense , widespread expression of TCL1 protein restricted to tumor cells in AIDS IBLP samples ( Fig .
2 4 and B , data not shown ) .
TCL1 protein staining was mainly cytoplasmic , although some nuclear staining was also seen .
TCL1 protein was not detected within heterogeneous nonlymphoma cell elements of these same tissue sections .
In contrast , no TCL1 protein expression was detected in non-AIDS IBLP samples ( Fig .
2 C and D , data not shown ) .
In agreement with SSH isolation results and virtual Northern analyses ( Fig .
1 ) , TCL1 protein was also detected in distinctive locations in HYP from HIV-infected and uninfected individuals .
Staining was intense and widespread within mantle zone B cells .
Intense TCL1 staining was also detected in rare interfollicular zone cells , none of which morphologically resembled transformed lymphoid cells or immunoblasts ( Fig .
2£ , data not shown ) .
Lower levels of TCL1 staining was seen in follicle center cells , including both centroblasts and centro-cytes .
Hyperplastic tonsil showed a pattern of intense TCL1 staining in germinal centers preferentially located in mantle-zone B cells similar to that seen in HYP ( Fig .
2F ) .
Although the cells are not distinguishable by routine histologic examination with light microscopy , non-AIDS IBLP 1 tissue contained residual fascin antibody-stained DRC that were not detected in AIDS IBLP 1 ( results not shown ) .

TCL1 antisera staining of formalin-fixed tissues .
An intense positive signal was confined to the large immunoblastic/plasmacytic tumor cells in AIDS IBLP 1 ( 4 , X400X % ; B , X 1,000 magnification ) , whereas non-AIDS IBLP 1 ( C , X400 ; D , X1,000 magnification ) was negative .
Non-tumor cell elements were negative for TCL1 protein expression in both samples .
TCL1 staining appeared mainly within the cytoplasm .
Germinal center B cells also stained with TCL1 antisera ( E , X100 ; F , X200 magnification ) .
Both uninfected and HIV-infected ( data not shown ) HYP contained activated germinal centers that reacted with TCL1 antisera .
In these samples , TCL1 staining was most intense in naive , nonproliferating mantle-zone B cells and in rare interfollicular zone cells of unknown phenotype .
A reduced staining intensity was seen in follicle-center cells ( centroblasts and centrocytes ) .
Overall , the level of staining in the different tissues analyzed correlated with the TCLI transcript levels detected by virtual Northern analysis .

Virtual Northern analysis of TCLI gene expression in AIDS IBLP and AIDS-related Burkitt 's lymphoma samples .
Blots were probed with a 350-bp random-primed TCL I cDNA fragment .
All of the IBLP samples tested were originally classified as B cell immunoblastic lymphomas by Working Formulation criteria , and as AIDS IBLP by the Revised European-American Lymphoma ( REAL ) AIDS-related classification , except lane 4 , which is an AIDS-related Burkitt 's lymphoma .
AIDS IBLP and an AIDS-related Burkitt 's lymphoma with and without known genetic or viral lesions express TCL1 .
Ethidium bromide gel staining demonstrated equal lane load-ing , and detection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in each lane showed that the original RNA templates of each tissue sample were of similar quality ( data not shown ) .
do not express fascin or BCA-1 , in agreement with the spectrum of genes isolated by SSH and with virtual Northern results ( 47 , 48 ) .
Detection of BCA-1 in non-AIDS IBLP 1 , coupled with residual fascin-positive antibody staining in this tumor , compared with a complete lack of both BCA-1 and fascin-stained cells in AIDS IBLP 1 , also suggest that DRC express BCA-1 .
The concordance of BCA-1 expression and fascin antibody staining in these two tumor samples , along with concordant expression in HYP 1 and 2 , also further confirms that both subtractions efficiently isolated differentially expressed genes .
TCL1 Expression in AIDS NHL with or Without Genetic/ Viral Alterations .
AIDS IBLP samples 1 and 2 expressed abundant TCL1 protein in lymphoma cells without additional genetic alterations or viral involvement .
This observation , coupled with detection of high levels of TCL1 protein in nonproliferating mantle-zone B cells and in scattered , rare interfollicular-zone cells of HYP and tonsil , suggests that TCL1 expression occurs early in AIDS lymphomagenesis .
We therefore considered whether AIDS NHL tumors with identified oncogenic alterations , ( perhaps representing later stage lymphomas ) also expressed TCL1I .
Virtual Northern analyses demonstrated that the large majority ( i.e. , six of eight ) AIDS IBLP patient samples tested expressed TCL1 , including three of five lymphoma samples of this class with additional identified genetic aberrations ( Fig .
3 ) .
These findings indicate that TCL1 is more consistently expressed in AIDS IBLP than any other known oncogene previously analyzed .
This prevalent expression strongly supports a possible role for TCL1I in the development of this class of AIDS NHL .
Interestingly , an AIDS-related Burkitt 's lymphoma derived from a salivary gland tumor also expressed moderate mRNA .
This latter observation suggests that additional classes of AIDS NHL should also be examined for TCLI expression .
DISCUSSION Two independent rounds of SSH were performed to isolate genes that are differentially expressed in AIDS IBLP versus non-AIDS IBLP tumors or activated lymph node ( 33 , 34 ) .

These combined steps define a powerful strategy for the isolation of differentially expressed genes from specific cells in heterogeneous surgical or biopsy tissue samples .
Among the differentially expressed genes identified with this approach , we focused on TCL1 because of its compelling biology in B cell development and its reported oncogenic activity in T cell leukemia/lymphoma .
TCLLI encodes a predominantly cytoplasmic protein of unresolved function that belongs to a novel family of recently identified oncogenes that now includes the MTCPI and TCLIb genes ( 42 , 52-55 ) .
Although its expression was originally reported to be limited to developing lymphocytes ( i.e. , fetal thymocytes , pre-B cells , and immature surface Ig M-expressing B cells in bone marrow ) and to endemic ( primarily Epstein-Barr virus* ) Burkitt 's lymphoma tumor cell lines , TCL expression recently has been documented in many immortalized B lymphoblastoid and B cell tumor lines ( 40-42 ) .
TCLI transcripts have also been reported in CD19* sorted peripheral-blood lymphocytes and in spleen and lymph nodes , although the cell ( s ) of origin was not defined in these latter tissues ( 41 ) .
Using immunohistochemical staining , we show that HYP and tonsil express TCL1 protein , with the highest levels of expression in mantle-zone B cells and in rare interfollicular-zone cells ( none of which resembled immunoblasts ) .
The mantle zone contains naive , unactivated B cells that may become activated within follicles and differentiate into either mature memory B cells or Ig-secreting plasma cells ( ref .
56 , reviewed in refs .
57-59 ) .
The finding of widespread TCL1 expression in quiescent mantle-zone B cells suggests that TCL1I expression may be involved in B cell survival rather than in proliferation or Ig/T cell receptor gene rearrangements as previously speculated ( 40 ) .
Mantle-zone B cells express abundant BCL-2 protein that serves to protect these resting B cells from apoptosis ( 58 , 60-62 ) .
Elevated TCLI expression within this same quiescent B cell population also may reflect a role in conferring resistance to apoptosis , although this possibility remains to be tested .
Fi-nally , the mantle zone is physically juxtaposed to the follicle center , which contains areas of extensive apoptotic activity ( along with reduced BCL-2 expression ) in which we also find decreased levels of TCL1 protein expression .
This concurrence lends further support for an antiapoptotic role for TCL1I .
Aberrant TCL1I expression has been previously reported in T cell leukemia/lymphoma with chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose the TCL I gene in proximity to the T cell-specific enhancers of either the T cell receptor « /8 or B loci ( 35-39 ) .
Transgenic mice expressing either or MTCPI from promoters that restrict expression to T cells developed early T cell proliferative expansions that progressed to T cell leukemia by 15 months of age ( 63 , 64 ) .
Interestingly , BCL-2 transgenic mice also developed B cell lymphomas slowly and in moderate numbers , in a manner paralleling the time course and occurrence of T cell tumors in TCLI transgenic mice ( reviewed in refs .
65 and 66 ) .
Humans may also sustain preleukemic TCL ] I translocations for many years before overt leukemia/ lymphoma formation ( 67 ) .
All of these observations provide strong support for the oncogenic potential of TCLLI and suggest that TCL 1 may function to promote cell survival rather than affecting cell proliferation .
AIDS IBLP are derived from postgerminal center cells and not from resting mantle-zone B cells ( reviewed in refs .
6 and 7 ) .
Elevated TCL1I expression in these cells may result from an abnormal up-regulation of the gene rather than the down-regulation that normally occurs in B cell maturation in germinal centers .
Lower protein expression in follicle-center B cells and weak mRNA expression in circulating peripheral-blood lymphocytes is consistent with a physiologic down-regulation of TCL1 from the high levels seen in quiescent mantle-zone B cells .
Alternatively , AIDS IBLP may originate Medical Sciences : Teitell et al .
from the rare intensely stained interfollicular-zone cells that express high levels of TCL1 protein .
AIDS lymphomas develop under unique and extreme pathological conditions .
These include moderate to severe immu-nodeficiency , chronic antigenic stimulation , profound alterations of cytokine expression profiles , and the loss of normal lymph-node architecture because of progressive immune system destruction ( reviewed in refs .
1-3 , 6 , 7 ) .
It is conceivable that abundant TCLI expression in AIDS lymphoma results from the radically altered cytokine profiles in AIDS or from the absence of critical cell-mediated regulatory influences ( e.g. , such as those provided by DRC or T cells ) that occur in normal lymph nodes .
The lack of these cell-mediated regulatory influences may also be responsible for the widely varying levels of TCL1 expression seen in multiple B cell tumor lines .
Resolution of the mechanism ( s ) controlling expression in AIDS lymphoma versus normal developing B cells will provide important insights into the contribution of TCLI expression in AIDS lymphomagenesis .
Unchecked , high-level expression is reported to cause early polyclonal , proliferative T cell expansions in transgenic mice .
The findings presented here strongly suggest that elevated TCL1 expression also may be involved in an abnormal cellular regulatory program that creates an equivalent , early , or premalignant lymphoproliferative state in B cells .
Subsequent transforming events , such as p53 mutations , c-MYC rearrangements , or other genetic alterations could then promote frank B cell tumor formation , in analogy to the effect of introducing c-MYC mutations into BCL-2 transgenic mice ( reviewed in refs .
