Mouse Interleukin-2 Receptor a Gene Expression INTERLEUKIN-1 AND INTERLEUKIN-2 CONTROL TRANSCRIPTION VIA DISTINCT cis-ACTING ELEMENTS* ( Received for publication , August 29 , 1994 , and in revised form , January 27 , 1995 ) Peter Sperisent§ , San Ming Wang+ # 1 , Elisabetta Soldaini , Maria Plal , Corinne Rusterholz , Philipp Bucher , Patricia Corthésy , Patrick Reichenbach , and Markus Nabholz** From the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research ( ISREC ) , 155 Chemin des Boveresses , CH-1066 Epalinges We have shown that interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and IL-2 control IL-2 receptor a ( IL-Z2Ra ) gene transcription in murine T lymphocyte precursors .
Here we map the cis-acting elements that mediate interleukin responsiveness of the mouse IL-2Ra « gene using a thymic lymphoma-derived hybridoma ( PC60 ) .
The transcriptional response of the IL-Z2Ra gene to stimulation by IL-1 + IL-2 is biphasic .
IL-1 induces a rapid , protein synthesis-independent appearance of IL-2Ra « mRNA that is blocked by inhibitors of NF- « B activation .
It also primes cells to become IL-2 responsive and thereby prepares the second phase , in which IL-2 induces a 100-fold further increase in IL-Z2Ra transcripts .
Transient transfection experiments show that several elements in the promoter-proximal region of the IL-2Ra « gene contribute to IL-1 responsiveness , most importantly an NF- « B site conserved in the human and mouse gene .
IL-2 responsiveness , on the other hand , depends on a 78-nucleotide segment 1.3 kilobases upstream of the major transcription start site .
This segment functions as an IL-2-inducible enhancer and lies within a region that becomes DNase I hypersensitive in normal T cells in which IL-2Ra « expression has been induced .
IL-2 responsiveness requires three distinct elements within the enhancer .
Two of these are potential binding sites for STAT proteins .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) is a growth factor for antigen-activated T lymphocytes .
IL-2 drives T cell proliferation by binding to a high affinity receptor that consists of three different trans-membrane proteins , IL-2 receptors ( IL-2R ) a , B , and y ( 1 ) .
IL-2Ra « expression is tightly regulated by extracellular *This work has been supported in part by grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Cancer League ( to M. N. ) and by a fellowship from ICSC-World Laboratory ( to S.-M. W. ) .

stimuli ( for review , see Ref .
2 ) .
It thereby controls , in part , IL-2 responsiveness .
In mature B and T lymphocytes , IL-2Ra synthesis is triggered by signals from the antigen receptor .
In antigen-activated T cells , IL-2 itself is required for prolonged IL-2Ra expression ( 3-9 ) .
In early CD4~CDS8~ thymic T cell precursors that have been activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and a calcium ionophore , IL-1 synergizes with IL-2 to increase IL-2Ra « mRNA levels and surface expression ( 10 ) .
Regulation of IL-2Ra « expression occurs mostly through changes in the rate of IL-2Ra gene transcription .
This has been shown by run-on transcription experiments for stimulation by phytohemagglutinin , IL-2 and IL-1 ( 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 ) , and confirmed by an analysis of mice carrying a mouse IL-2Ra 5'-flanking region/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transgene ( 65 ) .
In the human IL-2Ra gene , cis-acting regulatory elements have been identified by transient transfection of leukemia cell lines in which , however , the regulation of the resident gene had not been well characterized ( 13-20 ) .
Regulatory elements conferring responsiveness to a number of stimuli including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and IL-1 were found in the promoter proximal segment of the -flanking region ( 5'-FR ) of the gene ( 3 ' of position -390 , see below ) .
The elements required for IL-2 responsiveness have not yet been mapped .
Work in our laboratory has focused on the identification of regulatory elements in the mouse IL-2Ra gene .
We have shown ( 65 ) that in transgenic mice the segment between bp -2539 and +93 of the mouse IL-2Ra gene confers on a reporter gene correct cell type specificity and inducible expression in T cells and their early thymic precursors .
In the experiments described in this paper , we have used a rodent thymic lymphoma-derived cell line , PC6O ( 21 , 22 ) to define the regions in the 5'-FR that are required for IL-1- and IL-2-inducible expression .
PC60O cells express neither CD4 nor CD8 surface markers ( 22 ) , and , like normal CD4_-CD8~ thymocytes ( 10 ) , they respond to IL-1 and IL-2 by a strong increase in IL-2Ra gene transcription .
Previous work had shown that in this cell line the 2.5-kb 5'-FR of the mouse IL-2Ra gene conferred a response pattern on a reporter gene that was very similar to that of the genomic IL-2Ra « genes ( 11 ) .
Interleukin responsiveness clearly depended on sequences upstream of the promoter proximal region analyzed in the human gene .
Experiments using other cell lines , including an antigen specific IL-2-dependent T cell clone confirmed that the upstream segment was crucial for correct expression of mouse IL-2Ra gene recombinants . ''
Here we show that the response of the IL-2Ra gene to IL-1 + IL-2 is biphasic , and that this reflects a bipartite distribution of the interleukin response elements .
IL-1 responsiveness is mediated by several elements in the promoter proximal region , which includes an NF- « B site conserved in both human and * S. Barangé , P. Sperisen , and G. Plaetinck , unpublished results .
10743 10744 mouse genes , whereas IL-2 responsiveness depends on three separable 8-12-nucleotide elements within 48 nucleotides of an IL-2-responsive enhancer 1.3 kb upstream of the transcription start site .
This segment overlaps with a DNase I hypersensitive site detected only in normal T cells in which IL-2Ra expression has been induced ( 65 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines and Culture Conditions : Cytokines and Inhibitors-The PC60.21.14 cell line ( here referred to as PC6O ) has been described in previous publications ( 11 , 21-23 ) .
PC6O ( G3 ) are stable transfectants that constitutively express a cDNA clone encoding the human IL-2Ra chain ( 24 ) .
PC6O0 has inherited from its lymphoma parent the CD4~CD8~ phenotype ( 22 ) and the capacity to grow independently of IL-2 .
The culture conditions used , as well as the stimulation with IL-1 and IL-2 , have been described previously ( 11 , 23 , 25 ) .
Human recombinant interleukins were gifts of GLAXO IMB S.A. ( Plan-les-Ouates , Geneva , Switzerland ) .
IL-16 ( IL-1 ) was used at a final concentration of 1 ng/ml ; IL-2 was used at 100 units/ml .
Dithiocarbamate ( Sigma , Buchs , Switzerland ) compounds were used at final concentrations of 10 and 100 pm .
RNA and Nuclear Extract Preparations : RNase Protection and Band Shift Assays-RNA was extracted according to the method of Gough ( 26 ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the same method ( 27 ) .
Methods used for RNase protection and band shift assays are modifications of techniques developed by others and have been described in previous publications ( 23 , 28 ) .
The probes used have been described in detail elsewhere ( 10 ) .
The mouse IL-2Ra probe corresponds to a PstI cDNA segment ( bp 89-503 ) .
Experiments with rat T cell blast RNA showed that this probe also protects defined fragments of rat IL-2Ra mRNA ( data not shown ) .
RNase protection reactions were fractionated on sequencing gels .
Signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager , model SF ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale CA 94086 ) .
IL-2Ra signals were normalized to the B-actin signal , which was reduced to comparable levels by labeling the B-actin probe with [ « -* '' P ] JCTP of 10-fold lower specific activity .
Sequence Analysis-Parts of the sequence of the 5'-FR of the mouse IL-2Ra gene have been published previously ( 29 ) .
The sequence from bp -2589 to +93 has been determined on both strands by the dideoxy method and entered into the Genebank/EMBL data bases as modification of the original sequence ( EMBL accession M16398 , version 10 ) .
Human and mouse IL-2Ra « 5'-flanking sequences were aligned with the program BestFit from the GCG sequence analysis software package ( 30 ) using the default scoring system ( match = 1.0 , mismatch = -0.9 , gap weight = 5.0 + 0.3 x gap length ) .
TATA box ( 31 ) and GC box ( 81 ) motifs were identified using program EukProm from PC/Gene ( release 6.7 ( 1992 ) , IntelliGeneties Inc. , Mountain View , CA ) .
Consensus recognition sequences for transcription factors were located with the GCG program FindPattern ( 30 ) .
Searches for local sequence similarities were performed using the BLAST server at the National Institute for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda , MD ( 32 ) .
Optimal local alignments between selected sequence regions were generated with the aid of GCG program BestFit ( 30 ) using the default scoring system ( match = 1.0 , mismatch = -0.9 , gap weight = 5.0 + 0.3 x gap length ) .
Statistical significance of optimal alignment scores was assessed by calculating Z scores based on 100 shuffled sequence pairs .
Type and orientation of repetitive elements in the mouse IL-2Ra 5'-FR were identified by computing optimal alignment scores against a representative set of mammalian LINE and SINE sequences , including the sequences with the following EMBL accession numbers : X52235 ( version 10 ) , M30839 ( version 1 ) , M30839 ( version 4 ) , JO0628 ( version 1 , position 93-222 ) , MS87890 ( version 2 ) , K02592 ( version 2 , position 250-660 ) , JO1879 ( version 1 , position 441-522 ) , X02215 ( version 3 , position 587-849 ) .
The number and approximate location of elements sharing significant sequence similarities with one of the promoter regions was determined by matrix comparisons using GCG programs Compare and DotPlot ( 30 ) .
The exact delineation of the repetitive regions as shown ( see Fig .
4 ) is based on optimal local sequence alignments between the regions highlighted by the DotPlot method and the corresponding repetitive element sequence .
Internal direct repeats were searched for by the DotPlot method and by generating multiple locally optimal sequence alignments with the aid of program LAlign from the FastA package ( 83 ) .
The scoring system for multiple local sequence alignment was as follows : match = 4 , mismatch = -3 , gap weight = 8 + 4 X gap length .
Statistical significance of direct repeats was assessed by Z score calculations using program RSS from the same package .
Plasmids-Plasmids were prepared according to Ref .
23 .
Unless Bipartite Structure of Mouse IL-2Ra 5'-Flanking Region mentioned otherwise , plasmid constructions were made in pGEM3Zf ( + ) ( Promega ) .
The reference plasmid pGBAcBGID ( hereafter referred to as ref ) has been described previously ( 34 ) .
In plasmid pwt18GI ( hereafter referred to as pwt , see Fig .
44 ) the SphI-Pstl fragment from pUC18 mIL-2Rp ( 29 ) was joined to the 1664-bp PvuII rabbit B-globin gene fragment from Z-pCRUpRChrBG-1 ( 35 ) .
To facilitate the introduction of deletions in segment B and C , we constructed plasmid pBC in which B and C , separated by a Psfl site , are cloned between the Xbal and HindIII sites of pGEM3Zf ( + ) .
In plasmids pABC1BG1 ( pABC ) and pABC2GGI , ( pABC2 ) segments B and C are replaced by a double-stranded oligonucleotide ( 5'-gatcAAGCTTaagTCTA 3 ' , 3° TTCGAAt-tcAGATCTag 5 ) containing two unique restriction sites , HindIII ( bold-face ) and Xbal { underlined ) , in either one or the other orientation .
pR1GGI ( pR ) and pRiGGI ( pRi ) were obtained by introducing the Xbal-HindIII fragment of pBC into pABC or pABC2 .
All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing .
Mutations in Segment C-Deletions ACI-AC5 ( see Fig .
5A ) were introduced into pBC using existing restriction sites .
The modified Xbal-HindIII fragments were used to replace the Xbal-HindIII fragment in pR .
Deletions and substitution mutations within segment C3 ( see Fig .
5 , B and D ) were introduced into pBC with the in vitro mutagenesis system described in Ref .
36 .
The modified Nsil fragments were used to replace the corresponding fragment of pwt .
Deletions in Segment D-To construct deletions in region D of pwt , this segment was subcloned as a Bg/II ( -802 ) to Psfl ( +93 ) fragment .
Segments D1-D6 ( see Fig .
6B ) were removed using suitable restriction sites .
The modified D segments were used to replace the Xbal-Bsm1I fragment of plasmid pR , to give rise to plasmids pRAD1I-pRADS .
From each of these plasmids , segment C was removed by digestion with Psfl and Xbal to give rise to pRACAD1 , etc .
( see Fig .
6B ) .
pG1 Recombinants-pG1.BC was obtained by subcloning the Xbal-HindIII fragment of pBC into pG1 ( 37 ) , The resulting plasmid contains a single copy of segment B+C of the IL-2Ra 5'-flanking region in the reverse orientation .
To introduce fragments C3 or C2+C3 into pG1 , these segments were amplified from pwt with the proofreading Pfu polymerase ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The primers used contained an Xbal site at the 5 and a HindIII site at the 3 ' end .
The PCR products were digested with these enzymes and ligated with HindIII-Xbal-digested pG1l .
The resulting plasmids contain single copies of segment - 1635 to -1301 ( pG1.C2+C3 ) or segment -1403 to -1301 ( pG1.C3 ) of the IL-2Ra 5'-flanking region in their normal orientation .
Reporter Gene Assay-Cells were transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran according to Ref .
38 .
Reporter gene expression was measured as described previously ( 34 ) .
Briefly , cells were transfected with a defined ratio of an IL-2Ro/rabbit -globin gene construct and the reference plasmid .
This contains a rabbit B-globin gene with a 40-bp deletion in the second exon and is transcribed under the control of the constitutive chicken B-actin promoter ( 39 ) .
Cytoplasmic RNA of the transfected cells was treated with DNase I .
After cDNA synthesis from a poly ( dT ) primer with avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase , B-globin cDNA was amplified in the presence of [ a-* '' PIldATP with primers spanning the deletion in the reference plasmid and the first intron .
In some experiments we used , instead of the previously described 3 ' primer ( 34 ) , the oligonucleotide 5° ACGTTGCCCAG-GAG L GAAGT 3 ' , which spans the second intron of the B-globin gene ( L marks exon boundaries ) .
As expected , this reduces signals due to resid-val plasmid contaminating mRNA preparations .
PCR products were denatured and separated on a sequencing gel .
mRNA derived signals were quantified by PhosphorImager .
RESULTS Induction of IL-2Ra Expression in PC6GO Occurs in Two Phases-PC6O is a somatic cell hybrid between the mouse cytolytic T lymphocyte line B6.1 and the rat thymic lymphoma C58 ( 21 ) .
It has inherited from its lymphoma parent the CD4~CD8~ phenotype ( 22 ) and the capacity to grow independently of IL-2 .
In unstimulated PCBO cells , IL-2Ra « mRNA is barely detectable .
IL-1 and IL-2 induce appearance of IL-2R « mRNA and synergize to control its level ( 11 ) .
The interleukin response pattern of the rat IL-2Ra gene in the parental C58 lymphoma and in PC6O is identical to that of the mouse gene in PC6O ( data not shown ) .
This excludes the possibility that the interleukin response of the mouse IL-2Ra gene is an artifact due to a rearrangement of the mouse gene in the parental Bipartite Structure of Mouse IL-2Ra 5'-Flanking Region 10745 A Stimuli : f -- - IL-1 4 IL-2 .

Kinetics of IL-1 + IL-2-induced IL-2Ra « mRNA increase in PC6O0 .
A , PC6O cells were cultured for the indicated times in saturating concentrations of IL-1 and IL-2 .
Total cytoplasmic RNA was assayed by RNase protection with a mixture of antisense RNA probes for mouse IL-2Ra and B-actin ( empty arrowheads on left side of gel , see `` Material and Methods '' ) .
Note that the specific activity of the B-actin probe is 10 times lower than that of the IL-2Ra « probe .
B , mouse IL-2Ra « signals were quantified by PhosphorImager and normalized to the mouse B-actin signal in the same lane .
mouse T cell line or in PC6O itself .
A very similar response is observed in normal CD4~CD8~ thymocytes ( 10 ) .
Previously reported run-on experiments showed that IL-1 and IL-2 regulate IL-2Ra gene expression in PC6O cells by changing its rate of transcription , and we have shown ( 65 ) that the same is true for normal thymocytes .
Detailed analysis by RNase protection experiments ( Fig .
1 ) reveals that the interleukin-induced increase in IL-2Ra « mRNA levels in PC6O cells is biphasic .
Stimulation with IL-1 + IL-2 induces detectable transcripts within 1 h. The rate of increase in transcript levels slows down between 4 and 5 h after interleukin addition , but accelerates again between 10 and 18 h. This biphasic increase in IL-2Ra mRNA has been observed in three other experiments .
Maximal transcript levels , more than 1000-fold above background , are reached by about 48 h ( Ref .
11 and data not shown ) .
The Initial , IL-1-induced Phase of IL-2Ra « Induction Can Be Blocked by Inhibitors of NF-kB Activation-We previously showed that the early response of the IL-2R « gene can be induced by IL-1 alone and is protein synthesis-independent ( 11 ) .
IL-2 has no or very little effect during this stage .
The immediate responses of many genes to IL-1 are due to activation of NF-kB ( 40 ) .
In PC6O cells , IL-1 induces appearance of NF-kB in the nucleus and activates transcription from promoters with NF-kB binding sites ( 23 , 41 ) .
We therefore tested whether inhibitors of NF- « B activation ( 42 ) block the early response of the IL-2Ra « gene to IL-1 .
Fig .
2 shows that the addition of 100 unt pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) prior to and during a 3-h stimulation with IL-1 inhibits appearance of NF-kB in the nucleus and completely blocks the rise in IL-2Ra mRNA .
10 um PDTC has no inhibitory effect .
Longer incubation at inhibitory doses results in significant loss of viability .
Diethyl-DTC has the same effects ( results not shown ) .
The similar sensitivity of NF-kB activation and IL-2Ra « mRNA appearance to PDTC suggests that the two phenomena are linked and that the early phase of IL-2Ra « gene induction by IL-1 is mediated by NF-kB .
IL-1 Primes PC6O Cells to Become IL-2 Responsive-Stimu-lation of PC6O with IL-1 alone induces , beyond the first protein synthesis-independent phase of the response , a significant further increase in IL-2Ra « expression ( 11 ) .
This is due to the fact that IL-1 induces PC6O cells to secrete IL-2 , so that treatment with IL-1 alone amounts to stimulation with both interleukins .
IL-2 secretion peaks around 24 h , and after 72 h IL-2 is no longer detectable in culture supernatants .
This explains why IL-2Ra mRNA levels remain maximal in cells stimulated for 72 h with both IL-1 and exogenously supplied IL-2 ( 11 ) , while they have returned to very low levels in cells stimulated with IL-1 only .
However , the addition of IL-2 to such IL-1-prestimulated cells induces a rapid rise in IL-2Ra mRNA levels , whereas in cells that have not been exposed to IL-1 , IL-2 induces a barely detectable increase ( Fig .
3 ) .
The initial kinetics of the response of cells precultured in IL-1 do not depend on the continued presence of IL-1 ( data not shown ) .
Thus , preculture in IL-1 increases the capacity of PC6O cells to respond to IL-2 .
We refer to this effect as IL-1 priming .
Priming of PC6O cells presumably depends on a low level of IL-2Ra « expression that persists after 72 h in IL-1 , necessary for IL-2 responsiveness .
This is consistent with the finding that the IL-2 response of primed PC6O ( G3 ) cells , which constitutively express a human IL-2Ra « cDNA clone ( 24 ) , is much stronger than that of PC6O itself .
But the fact that priming can be observed also in PC6O ( G3 ) indicates that it requires other IL-1l-induced changes .
PC6O cells express the IL-2RB gene constitutively but prolonged exposure to IL-1 induces a 10-30-fold increase in IL-2RB mRNA and a 10-fold 10746 A Fic .

F , free probe .
B-Actin & 1 increase in high affinity IL-2 receptors ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that priming also depends on increased IL-2R $ chain expression .
There may yet be other factors that control responsiveness .
This might explain the considerable variation in the maximal inducible level of IL-2Ra mRNA in primed PC6O cells , which is 3-10 times weaker than that in unprimed cells stimulated with IL-1 + IL-2 in the same experiment ( data not shown ) .
Thus , IL-1 has two effects on PC6O cells .
First , it rapidly induces IL-2Ra gene transcription , at least in part via protein synthesis-independent pathways that lead to activation of NF-kB .
Second , it increases the capacity of PC6O cells to respond to IL-2 , partly by increasing IL-2Ra « and IL-2RB expression .
This priming effect permitted us to use PC6O cells for the mapping of the cis-acting elements that control IL-2 responsiveness of the IL-2Ra « gene .
Mapping of Interleukin Responsive cis- Acting Elements in the IL-2Ra Gene-Previously , we had shown that in PC6O cells a segment of the mouse IL-2Ra « gene comprising the promoter , the transcription start site , and a 2.5-kb 5'-FR ( position -2539 to +93 , segment A-D , see Fig .
4A ) conferred on a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene a response pattern to IL-1 and IL-2 that resembled closely that of the genomic IL-2Ra gene ( 11 ) .
In normal CD4~CD8~ thymocytes of transgenic mice carrying the same construct , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression responds to IL-1 and IL-2 with the same pattern as in PC6O ( 65 ) .
For the mapping of interleukin response elements in the IL-2Ra « 5'-FR , we switched from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to a rabbit B-globin reporter gene in order to be able to measure reporter gene mRNA levels with a previously described PCR-based assay ( 34 ) .
This method allows very accurate quantification of promoter responses to stimulation , e.g .
with interleukins ( 41 ) .
Fig .
4B shows that the interleukin responses of plasmid pR , which contains segments A-D of the IL-2Ra « 5-FR , are the same as those of the previously described equivalent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct ( pmIL-2RaPrCAT1 , see Ref .
11 ) .
When plasmid pR is transfected into unprimed PC6O0 cells , subsequent stimulation with IL-1 alone induces , on average , a 5-fold increase in reporter gene expression .
As pointed out above , under these conditions , stimulation with IL-1 results in transient IL-2 secretion .
IL-2 stimulates a small but reproducible response , whereas both cytokines together stimulate a 12-fold increase in reporter gene mRNA .
When the same plasmid is transfected into PC6O cells that 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 me -a B-Actin Pos acs ec tn ie have been primed by culture in IL-1 for 72 h , the pattern of interleukin responsiveness changes .
IL-2 alone induces a response that is almost as strong as that to IL-1 + IL-2 .
Comparison of these results with the interleukin response of the genomic IL-2Ra « gene in primed and unprimed PC6O cells shows a strikingly similar pattern , although the responses of the genomic IL-2Ra gene are stronger than that of the reporter gene constructs .
Such differences are observed in most transient transfection studies of promoters .
There is considerable variability in the magnitude of the IL-2 response of pwt in primed cells ( see e.g .
Fig .
7 ) , which may be related to similar variation in the inducibility of the genomic IL-2Ra « gene , but the response pattern is completely reproducible .
The interleukin inducibility of plasmid pwt ( see Fig .
44 ) does not differ significantly from that of pR , indicating that the insertion of restriction sites in the latter construct had no effect on interleukin responsiveness .
Comparing the time course of IL-2-induced accumulation of IL-2Ra transcripts ( Fig .
3 ) with that of plasmid pwt mRNA in unprimed and IL-1 primed cells ( Fig .
4C ) , we found that both responded without a measurable lag and with similar kinetics .
These results show that many if not all of the cis-acting elements that control the complex response of the IL-2Ra gene to IL-1 and IL-2 are contained in segments A-D. IL-2 Response Elements-In previous experiments , we had found that segment C conferred IL-2 responsiveness on a heterologous viral ( HSV-tk ) promoter ( 11 ) .
This is consistent with the results shown in Fig .
4 , demonstrating that a plasmid in which segment C has been deleted ( pRAC ) can still respond to IL-1 in unprimed PC60 cells but completely fails to respond to IL-2 in either primed or unprimed cells .
Note that deletion of segment C ( or B+C , Fig .
5 ) does not significantly alter constitutive promoter activity .
The orientation of segment C in the 5'-FR can be inverted ( in plasmid pRi ) without affecting the response to IL-2 ( Fig .
5A ) .
We have mapped the elements in segment C required for IL-2 responsiveness in three stages ( Fig .
5 ) .
In the first step , we introduced a series of contiguous deletions of 160-250 bp into segment C. Comparing the IL-2 responsiveness of these plasmids in IL-1-primed PC60 cells ( Fig .
5A ) we found that deletion of the segment between bp -1389 and -1228 ( C3 ) completely abolished IL-2 responsiveness .
The plasmid with this deletion ( pRAC3 ) failed to respond in cells stimulated with IL-2 for times between 1 and 48 h ( Fig .
4 , C and D ) .

Priming with IL-1 increases the responsiveness of the IL-2Ra « gene to stimulation with IL-2 .
PC6O cells were cultured for 3 days in normal medium or in the presence of IL-1 .
Both IL-1-primed and nonprimed cells were aliquoted into fresh cultures ( 0 h ) , and cells were harvested 48 h later .
During this time , IL-2 was added to individual cultures to be present for the indicated period prior to RNA extrac-tion .

Signals were quantified and normalized to B-actin mRNA signals ( A ) .

not abolish the IL-2 response .
Deletion of other parts of segment C did not significantly affect IL-2 responsiveness .
Note that the changes in IL-2 responsiveness do not correlate with variations in constitutive promoter activity ( see legend to Fig .
5A ) .
To delimit more precisely the sequences within segment C3 that were required for IL-2 responsiveness , we introduced six contiguous deletions within this segment into plasmid pwt that contains the entire IL-2Ra « 5'-FR .
Two of these deletions , AC3.1 and AC3.3 , abolished IL-2 responsiveness , and removal of the intervening segment , C3.2 , strongly reduced IL-2 responsiveness ( Fig .
5B ) , whereas deletions in the remaining part of segment C3 ( AC3.4 , AC3.5 and AC3.6 ) had no significant effect on the capacity of the corresponding plasmids to be stimulated by IL-2 .
Again , there was no correlation between constitutive promoter activity and IL-2 responsiveness among the plasmids of this series ( see the legend to Fig .
5B ) .
To test whether the segment defined by deletions AC3.1 , AC3.2 , and AC3.3 was sufficient to confer IL-2-inducible enhancer activity on a heterologous promoter , we inserted the fragment between nucleotides -1406 and -1301 upstream of the minimal B-globin promoter of pG1 ( 37 ) that does not respond to stimulation by IL-2 .
The resulting plasmid , pG1.C3 , 10747 responds to IL-2 as well as pG1.BC , which contains the entire segment B+C ( Fig .
5C ) .
Addition of segment C2 , in plasmid pG1.C2+C3 , does not significantly improve IL-2 inducibility .
Finally , we mapped the elements required for IL-2 responsiveness of the IL-2Ra « gene by scanning the segments C3.1 , C3.2 , and C.3.3 with a series of mutations involving 4-9 nucleotides each .
The results ( Fig .
5D ) show that IL-2 responsiveness of pwt depends on three separate stretches that are between 6 and 12 nucleotides long .
These sites are defined by mutations M4 , M5 , and M6 ( site I ) , mutation M9 ( site II ) and mutations M12 and M13 ( site III ) .
Each of them presumably corresponds to the binding site of a transcription factor required for IL-2 responsiveness ( see `` Discussion '' ) .
IL-1 Response Elements-The results shown in Fig .
4B demonstrate that removal of segment C does not abolish IL-1 responsiveness of the IL-2Ra « 5'-FR .
The data presented in Fig .
2 indicate that the early protein synthesis-independent response of the genomic IL-2Ra gene to IL-1 requires activation of NF- « B , and studies on the human promoter proximal region have shown that the IL-1 response mediated by this segment depended on a NF- « B site ( 18 ) , which is conserved in the mouse gene ( Fig .
6A , kBI1 in Fig .
6B ) .
This led us to investigate the effect of deletions in the conserved promoter proximal region on the IL-1 responsiveness of the mouse gene .
Since stimulation of PC6O with IL-1 induces secretion of IL-2 , we used for these experiments recombinants that had been made IL-2 unresponsive by the removal of region C. Fig .
6B compares the constitutive expression and IL-1 responsiveness of plasmids missing various segments of the region between position -585 and -54 .
Note that the ratio between reference plasmid and IL-2Ra « recombinant is not the same in all the transfections ( see legend to Fig .
6C ) .
It should also be pointed out that the normalization of signals derived from IL-2Ra « recombinant transcripts ( ¢ ) to the signals derived from reference plasmid mRNA ( r ) is very precise and allows reliable determination of 2-fold inductions .
The expression of the plasmid containing an intact D region ( pRAC ) is increased about 5-fold by stimulation with IL-1 .
Deletion AD3 completely abolishes this response , indicating that all IL-l-responsive elements in pRAC are contained in the segment between positions -585 and -54 .
Note that the constitutive expression of plasmid pRACAD3 is not significantly different from that of pRAC .
Deletion AD4 , which removes 23 bp , containing the NF- « B site ( xB1 ) conserved in the mouse and the human genes , reduces IL-1 responsiveness to 2-3-fold .
Removal of the segment 5 of this stretch ( AD1 ) reduces responsiveness to the same extent as AD4 , indicating that elements upstream of the conserved NF-kB site are required for a complete IL-1 response .
Deletion AD6 does not reduce IL-1 responsiveness , confirming that elements between position -585 and -246 contribute most of the response .
However , the plasmid with the complementary deletion , AD2 , still responds reproducibly , albeit weakly , to IL-1 , indicating that elements downstream of B1 may also contribute to the IL-1 response of the IL-2R « gene .
The increased base-line expression of pRACAD1 suggests a role for the conserved negative regulatory element-2 ( see Fig .
6A ) that reduces expression of human IL-2R « constructs in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated Jurkat cells ( 17 ) , but in this case , pRACAD2 would be expected to show a similarly increased constitutive activity .
Promoter Proximal Elements Are Not Essential for IL-2 Responsiveness-Testing the effect of deletions AD1I-AD6 on the IL-2 response of plasmids containing an intact C region in IL-1-primed cells we found that none of these deletions abolish the response ( Fig .
7 ) , although some markedly reduce it .

The IL-2Ra « 5'-FR controls transcriptional responses to IL-1 and IL-2 .
A , mouse IL-2Ra « 5'-FR and IL-2Ro/rabbit -globin reporter gene recombinants .
Note that nucleotide numbering is changed with respect to previous publications ( 11 , 29 ) to start at the major cap site ( +1 ) of IL-2Ra transcripts in T cell lines ( 61 ) as well as normal mature T cells and thymocytes .
In the top representation are also indicated the positions of repetitive elements .
Plasmid pwt contains the -2539/+93 ( SpAI ( S ) to PstI ( P ) ) segment of the IL-2R « gene .
The segment is subdivided into regions A , B , C and D , separated by Bg/II sites ( B ) .
Plasmid pR is identical to pwt except for restriction sites that have been inserted into the Bg/II sites ( H , HindIII ; X , Xbal ; see `` Materials and Methods '' ) .
In pRAC , the entire C segment is deleted .
B , interleukin response pattern of IL-2Ra/rabbit B-globin reporter gene recombinants .
PC6O cells were cultured in normal medium or in the presence of IL-1 for 3 days prior to transfection .
Nonstimulated or IL-1-primed cells were transfected with a mixture of the indicated IL-2Ra construct , and a reference plasmid carrying a modified version of the same reporter gene joined to the constitutive rabbit B-actin promoter ( pGBAcBGID or ref ) .
Transfected cells were split into aliquots that were cultured in the presence or the absence of the indicated interleukins for 48 h. Reporter gene transcripts were revealed by PCR amplification of -globin cDNA according to Ref .
34 .
The ratio of IL-2R « ( i ) to reference signal ( r ) , determined with a PhosphorImager , is a measure of the promoter activity of the corresponding IL-2Ra « construct .
By comparing this normalized promoter activity in unstimulated and interleukin-stimulated cells , one can quantify the interleukin response of the IL-2Ra « recombinant .
The values shown represent means of three independent experiments with ranges below each column .
C and D , kinetics of the IL-2 response of IL-2Ra « 5'-FR/B-globin reporter gene recombinants .
Primed or unstimulated PC6O cells were transfected with 0.4 pmol of the reference plasmid and 2 pmol of IL-2R « 5'-FR/B-globin recombinants pwt or pRAC3 ( see Fig .
5A ) .
Aliquots of the transfected cells were cultured either in normal medium or in the presence of IL-1 for 48 h. IL-2 was added to individual cultures to be present for the indicated period prior to harvest and RNA extraction and assay of reporter gene expression .
Note that the IL-2Ra mRNA levels were measured in the same samples ( see Fig .
3 ) .
The gel shown ( D ) represents the results obtained with primed cells .
C does not depend on sequences between position -585 and -54 .
This is in agreement with the finding that segment C3 can confer IL-2 responsiveness on a heterologous promoter ( Fig .
5C ) .
The observation that AD2 does not significantly alter IL-2 responsiveness argues against any role for NF-kB in this response since computer searches have not revealed any NF- « B consensus site in the mouse IL-2Ra « 5'-FR apart from « B1 and « B2 ( see legend to Fig .
6A for definition of NF- « B consensus site ) .
DISCUSSION PC6O Is a Model for Normal CD4~CD8~ Thymocytes-We have recently shown that IL-1 and IL-2 synergize to induce IL-2R « mRNA levels and surface expression in normal CD4~CD8~ thymocytes .
Analysis of transgenic mice lines ( 65 ) demonstrated that this regulation depends on the 5'-FR of the IL-2Ra « gene .
In this paper we have used a CD4~CD8~ cell line whose response to IL-1 and IL-2 is very similar to that of normal cells with the same phenotype to analyze more closely the mechanisms that mediate interleukin responsiveness of the IL-2Ra gene and to localize the cis-acting elements controlling it .
Since these cells do not depend on interleukins for growth or survival , the responses analyzed are not the indirect consequences of the growth factor activity of these interleukins .
Stimulation of PC6O cells with IL-1 + IL-2 induces a biphasic increase in IL-2Ra « mRNA levels .
The first phase is a protein synthesis-independent response to IL-1 that can be blocked by inhibitors of NF- « B activation .
The second phase is due mainly to IL-2 and starts at about 10 h. This delay is due to the fact that unstimulated cells respond very slowly to IL-2 alone , whereas stimulation with IL-1 induces a strong increase in IL-2 responsiveness .
This priming effect reflects , most likely , a rise in IL-2Ra « and IL-2RB expression that results in an increased number of high affinity IL-2R .

Mapping of IL-2 responsive elements in segment C. A , the sequences required for IL-2 responsiveness lie between bp -1389 and -1228 .
The indicated IL-2Ro/B-globin recombinants were transfected into IL-1 primed PC6O0 cells together with reference plasmid at a ratio of 5:1 .
The transfected cells were cultured for 48 h in IL-1 with or without IL-2 .
Promoter activity of the IL-2Ra « constructs is determined by normalizing the corresponding mRNA signal to that from the cotransfected reference plasmid .
The IL-2 response is the ratio between promoter activity after culture in IL-1 + IL-2 and the activity after culture in IL-1 alone .
Indicated is the mean of two independent experiments , with ranges given below each bar .
Base-line promoter activity ( in IL-1 only ) of the different IL-2Ra « constructs , normalized to that of pwt ( =1 ) , varied within the following ranges : pABC , 1.4-1.5 ; pR , 0.6-0.8 ; pRi , 0.3-0.5 ; pRAC1 , 0.2-0.3 ; pRAC2 , 0.3-0.5 ; pRAC3 , 1.6-1.7 ; pRACA4 , 0.4-0.5 ; pRACS5 , 1.0-1.5 .

IL-2 responses of the different plasmids were determined as in A. Base-line expressions , normalized to that of pwt , ranged as follows : pRAC3 , 1.5-2.0 ; pRAC3.1 , 1.1-1.8 ; pRAC3.2 , 0.6-1.0 ; pRAC3.3 , 0.9-1.6 ; pRAC3.4 , 0.9-1.3 ; pRAC3.5 , 1.0 ; pRAC3.6 , 1.9-3.0 .
C , segment C3 acts as an IL-2 responsive enhancer .
Single copies of different portions of the IL-2Ra « -flanking region were inserted upstream of the minimal -globin promoter of pG1 .
IL-2 responses of the different plasmids were determined as in A .
The results shown are means of two experiments .
The responses varied by less than 20 % .
Mean base-line expressions , normalized to that of pGBAcBGID ( reference plasmid ) , were 0.06 ( pG1 ) , 0.06 ( pG1.BC ) , 0.15 ( pG1.C2+C3 ) and 0.12 ( pG1.C3 ) .
D , three separate elements in the enhancer are required for IL-2 responsiveness .

IL-2 responsiveness does not require promoter-proximal elements .
IL-1 primed PC6O cells were transfected with reference plasmid and plasmids containing an intact region C but deletions in segment D ( pRAD1L to pRAD6G , see Fig .
6B ) .
Aliquots of the transfected cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of the indicated interleukins .
Reporter gene expression is compared with that in cells cultured in normal medium after transfection ( =1 ) .
Each construct was tested at least three times .
The figure shows the mean of two different experiments in which the entire series of plasmids was transfected into the same batch of primed cells , with the range of values obtained below each column .
Interleukin response ( fold stimulation ) t o IL-2Ra mRNA is due mainly to an increase in IL-2Ra gene transcription .
The experiments described in this paper have allowed us to map the cis-acting elements that control both phases of mRNA increase .
IL-1-responsive Elements Map to the Conserved Promoter Proximal Region-The elements that account for the direct response to IL-1 are contained within the promoter proximal segment ( position -585 to -54 ) of the IL-2Ra gene .
Between bp -335 and the transcription start site the mouse gene is 78 % homologous to the human gene ( Fig .
64 ) .
Within this segment , a conserved motif that was recognized as a NF-kB consensus binding site ( B1 ) appears to play a major role as an IL-1 response element .
This is consistent with the finding that inhibitors of NF- « B activation prevent the early response of the endogenous IL-2Ra gene in PC6O .
It is also in agreement with a previous study in which the human 5'-FR was analyzed in murine EL4 cells ( 18 ) .
However , sequences upstream of the conserved NF- « B site are required to obtain a full response .
The contribution of this segment ( D1 ) may be due to a second NF- « B site ( « B2 ) .
But this motif is not conserved in the human gene , and it seems more likely that an AP-1 site present in both species around position -335 contributes to the IL-1 response ( Fig .
6A ) .
We have previously shown that AP-1 elements can mediate IL-1 responsiveness in PCSO .
AP-1-dependent mRNA increases are slower than those mediated by NF- « B and are not yet detectable after 4 h of IL-1 treatment ( 23 ) .
Thus , NF- « B may mediate the very early response of the endogenous IL-Z2Ra « gene to IL-1 , which is completely blocked by PDTC , while AP-1 may act in a later response phase .
In spite of the strong homology between the promoter proximal regions of the mouse and the human IL-2Ra genes the binding sites for SRF and Spl ( GC-box ) that are immediately downstream of the NF- « B site in the human gene and that have been implicated in its phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate response ( 19 , 43 , 44 ) , are not conserved in the mouse gene .
The sequence called NF IL-2RA or UE-1 ( 19 , 44 ) is partially con-served , but the specificity of the protein ( s ) binding to this element has not been sufficiently well characterized to determine whether their binding site is present in the mouse gene .
IL-2 Responsiveness of the Mouse IL-2Ra Gene Depends on Three Closely Spaced Elements 1.3 kb Upstream of the Transcription Start Site-None of the deletions in segment D abolishes IL-2 responsiveness .
Removal of the NF- « B consensus sites « B1 and « B2 in deletion AD2 does not significantly affect IL-2 inducibility .
Since a computer search revealed no additional NF- « B sites in segments A-D ( see legend to Fig .
6A for search conditions ) , it is unlikely that NF- « B plays a direct role in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2Ra gene by IL-2 .
Even pRAD3 in which all IL-1 response elements have been removed is still significantly stimulated by IL-2 .
This result implies that IL-l-mediated transcriptional activation of the 10751 STIMULUS : { ict N i12 Q i1+1L2 .

£C = C c a p 8 *to do i Oi i ib g a a A. a. a. a. Plasmid IL-2Ra gene is not a prerequisite for the activity of the IL-2-responsive elements in segment C. It is consistent with the observation that segment C3 acts as an IL-2-responsive enhancer on a heterologous promoter ( Fig .
5C ) that can not be stimulated with IL-1 ( 45 ) .
Nevertheless , the reduced IL-2 responsiveness of plasmids with deletions in the promoter proximal region ( particularly pADS , pAD3 , and pAD6 ) suggests that maximal activity of the IL-2-responsive elements in segment C3 does depend on elements in the promoter region itself .
Using IL-1 primed cells , we have shown that the elements in segment C that are strictly required for IL-2 responsiveness of the IL-2Ra gene map to a 48-bp segment 1.3 kb upstream of the transcription start site .
Elsewhere ( 65 ) we show that in normal T lymphocytes , a DNase I-hypersensitive site appears at this position when cells are stimulated to express the IL-2Ra gene .
This provides completely independent evidence for an important regulatory role of this segment .
Our results show that three separate elements within the 48-bp segment are required for full IL-2 responsiveness .
Site I ( defined by mutations M4-M6 ) contains a nucleotide sequence that is identical to the core of the GAS-1 element in the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase gene .
This sequence binds several cytokine-inducible members of the STAT family of transcription factors ( 46-48 ) .
Since it has recently been shown that IL-2 can activate STAT proteins that recognize similar motifs ( 49 , 50 ) , it is likely that site I is the target of such a factor .
However , band shift and footprint-ing experiments with PC6O nuclear extracts have not yet revealed any IL-2-inducible DNA-binding proteins specific for sequences in C3 .
The sequence of site II ( defined by mutation M9 ) is very similar to that of site I and may also be a target of an IL-2-induced STAT protein .
But it includes a potential binding site for factors of the GATA family , a member of which has been implicated in the regulation of T cell-specific gene expression ( 51-53 ) .
Site III ( defined by mutations M12 and M13 ) forms part of a consensus binding site for transcription factor Ets-1 ( 54 ) .
The consensus site extends into the nucleotides altered in M14 , but this mutation is compatible with Ets-1 binding .
Site III overlaps with a DNase I footprint over position -1331 to -1314 that is obtained with extracts from induced as well as nonstimulated PC6O cells . ''
Further work is required to definitively identify the transcription factors that confer IL-2 responsiveness to the C3 segment , and to define their role in this response .
We also plan to explore whether the finding that significant IL-2 responsiveness requires three distinct but closely spaced elements is a reflection of some form of direct cooperation between the proteins binding to these sites .
Stimulation of IL-2Ra « transcription by IL-2 has been observed in human cells , and it seems likely that the proteins and ° M. Pla , P. Sperisen , and M. Nabholz , unpublished results .

Model for the transcriptional regulation of the mouse IL-2Ra gene by IL-1 ( or antigen ) and IL-2 .
The model postulates that the biphasic response of the IL-2Ra gene to stimulation by IL-1 and IL-2 in CD4~CD8~ thymocytes or to antigen and IL-2 in mature T cells is controlled by two independently functioning sets of regulatory elements .
IL-1 or antigen activate the first phase of transcription via promoter proximal elements , among them a critical NF-KB site .
Simul-taneously , these signals induce cells to become IL-2 responsive , and thus prime them for the second phase .
This is mediated by IL-2-responsive elements 1.3 kb upstream of the promoter .
sequence elements that mediate this regulation are the same in rodents and in man .
The sequence of the 5-FR of the human gene until position -1241 has been published .
The two genes share highly homologous promoter-proximal regions , but apart from homology between repetitive Alu and B1 elements ( see Fig .
4A for repetitive elements in the mouse gene ) there is no significant similarity upstream of position -335 in the mouse gene .
Recombinants between the -1241/+93 segment of the human IL-2Ra « and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene do not respond to stimulation with IL-2 in PC6O cells . ''
Thus , the human IL-2 response elements do not seem to be present in the part of the gene for which sequence data have been published .
IL-2 has the characteristics of a progression factor , in that it stimulates the proliferation of `` competent '' , IL-2-responsive lymphocytes ( 55-57 ) .
In PC6O cells , the effect on IL-Z2Ra expression is uncoupled from the growth factor activity of IL-2 .
This suggests that the signal transduction pathway leading from the IL-2 receptor to the IL-2Ra gene is different from the one that drives cells into S-phase .
It may overlap with the pathways that mediate IL-2 stimulation of granzyme and per-forin expression ( 28 , 58 ) in T cells .
In B cells , IL-2 stimulates IgJ-chain expression ( 59 ) .
IL-2 responsiveness of the J-chain gene depends on a 28-bp stretch between position -74 and -41 ( 60 ) .
This sequence has no significant similarity with segment C , suggesting that IL-2 stimulates IgJ expression via different transcription factors .
A General Model for the Regulation of IL-2Ra Gene Tran-scription-The results presented in this paper are summarized in the model shown in Fig .
8 .
They show that the complex transcriptional response of the IL-2R « gene in CD4~CDS8S~ thymocytes to IL-1 + IL-2 can be explained by the existence of two sets of cis-acting elements .
Promoter proximal elements , among which a conserved NF-KB site plays a dominant role , mediate an early response that is stimulated by IL-1 alone .
IL-1 also increases IL-2 responsiveness of the cells by augmenting the number of functional IL-2R .
IL-2 induces the second phase of the IL-2Ra gene , which is mediated by a complex Bipartite Structure of Mouse IL-2Ra 5'-Flanking Region enhancer 1.3 kb upstream of the transcription start site .
Thus , the biphasic response correlates with a bipartite structure of 5'-FR .
We believe that the model presented here also applies to the antigen-triggered induction of IL-2Ra « expression in mature lymphocytes and that antigen plays a similar role to IL-1 .
Stimulation of T cells with antigen or anti-CD3 induces activation of NF-kB , and we have found that the early phase of antigen-induced increase in IL-2Ra mRNA in a CD8* T cell clone shows the same sensitivity to inhibition by PDTC of NF- « B activation . ''
In the same clone , IL-2Ra mRNA levels return to base line 24 h after exposure to antigen unless IL-2 is added , and we have shown that maximal and prolonged expression of both the normal IL-2Ra gene and a IL-2Ra 5'-FR/ chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transgene in concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral T cells depends on IL-2 ( 65 ) .

Note Added in Proof-Recently it has been shown ( 66 ) that an Elf-1 binding site around bp 92 in the human IL-2R « gene is important for its response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
This site is conserved in the mouse gene ( see Fig .
