Pertini Hospital , and { Libera Universita Campus Biomedico , Rome , Italy ( Accepted for publication 25 July 2000 ) SUMMARY Persistent activation of the immune system is one of the hallmarks of HIV-1 infection .
In this study we analysed the induction of factors involved in cytokine signal transduction , such as STAT 1 proteins and IRF-1 mRNA , in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) exposed to HIV-infected cells , and the induction of apoptosis .
Western blot analyses and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results indicate that both cells infected with a X4 strain and cells infected with a R5 strain are able to increase intracellular levels of STAT la and B proteins as well as IRF-1 mRNA .
This effect was prevented by neutralizing antibodies against interferon-alpha ( IFN- ) .
HIV-l-infected cells dose-dependently induced apoptotic commitment in normal PBMC , as revealed by DNA fragmentation analysis , but this was not accompanied by an increase of caspase-3 activity , even if a slight up-regulation of IL-1 B-converting enzyme mRNA was detected .
Apoptosis induction could be abrogated mainly by antibodies against tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) and , to a lesser extent , by antibodies against IFN-y .
All these findings suggest that uninfected PBMC can undergo activation of signal transduction and apoptosis after exposure to bystander HIV-infected cells , subsequent to the induction of cytokines such as IFNs and TNF-a .
Keywords - signal transduction - cytokines INTRODUCTION A persistent and inappropriate activation of the immune system is commonly thought to represent one of the indirect mechanisms involved in progressive disappearance of T lymphocytes caused by HIV-1 [ 1-3 ] .
The chronic lymphomonocyte activation is characterized by : increased expression of cell activation markers ; altered lymphoproliferative response ; secretion of a peculiar pattern of cytokines ; B cell polyclonal activation ; increased commitment to apoptosis [ 2,4-7 ] .
In this respect , the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 is considered to play a major role .
In fact , gp120 , through its binding to CD4 , is able to impair TCR-CD3 signalling , both as a result of physical dissociation of p56-Ick from CD4 , and as consequence of direct activation of ZAP-70 PTK [ 8,9 ] .
Other effects can be attributed to the binding of gp120 to coreceptors such as gal-cer [ 10 ] or chemokine receptors ( manu-script in preparation and [ 11 ] ) .
Furthermore , gp120 stimulates the release of interferon-alpha ( IFN-a ) and IFN-y , IL-6 , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) , IL-1 , IL-10 , IL-8 and RANTES , giving rise to an altered cytokine profile that roughly corresponds Correspondence : Maria R.

This altered pattern of cytokine induction may be in turn related to increased commitment to apoptosis .
HIV-infected subjects commonly display altered levels and function of transcription factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 1 [ 17 ] , involved in the effector function of one of the main classes of HIV-induced cytokines , i.e .
the IFN family [ 18,19 ] .
Additionally , IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) -1 , induced by many HIV-1-driven cytokines , is able to up-regulate IL-1B-converting enzyme ( ICE ) , also known as caspase-1 , that can be involved in apoptosis [ 20 ] .
In this study we used an established experimental model , consisting of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from normal donors exposed to cells infected with either a X4 ( IIIB ) or a R5 ( Bal ) HIV-1 strain and fixed with formaldehyde [ 10,12,16 ] .
In this system we analysed the induction of transcription activation factors such as STAT 1 and IRF-1 together with the commitment to apoptosis , exploring the possible involvement of HIV-induced cytokines in these phenomena .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of HIV-1-infected fixed cells Lymphoblastoid T cells , uninfected ( H9 ) or chronically infected © 2000 Blackwell Science Induction of signal transduction and apoptosis by HIV-1-infected cells 375 with HIV-1 ( H9/IIIB ) , growing in logarithmic phase , were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde as described [ 10 ] .
CD4 lymphocytes infected with HIV-1 Bal were obtained by acute infection of CD8-depleted PBMC with the monocytotropic strain HIV-1 BaL , i.e .
CD8-depleted PBMC were activated with phytohaemagglu-tinin ( PHA ) for 3 days , infected with HIV-1 Bal strain and maintained in medium supplemented with IL-2 ( 100 U/ml ) for 10 days , then fixed as above .
A parallel culture of uninfected CD4 lymphocytes was fixed and used as control [ 16 ] .
Experimental design PBMC , separated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation from buffy coats of healthy donors , were exposed to HIV-1-infected cells fixed as above , at a ratio of 30:1 , unless otherwise specified , at a final concentration of 2 x 10° PBMC/ml in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
In all the experiments , untreated PBMC and PBMC exposed to the corresponding uninfected cells were used as negative controls .
After 18 h incubation the pellets were collected , washed and stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis .
Cytokine neutralization was achieved by using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against either IFN-a ( original titre : 5 x 10° neutralization units ( NU ) /m1I ) or IFN-y ( original titre : 50 000 NU/m !
) , obtained in our laboratory [ 13 ] .
In these experiments the concentration of antibodies to IFN-a and IFN-y used was 80 000 and 1000 NU , respectively , ie .
5-10-fold higher than that required to neutralize the IFNs present in the supernatants of PBMC exposed to HIV-infected cells ( 3000-30 000 U/ml for IFN-a « and 50-100 U/ml for IFN-y ) [ 10,12,13 ] .
TNF-a neutralization was achieved by using a MoAb ( clone 1825.121 ; R & D Systems , Abingdon , UK ) , with a neutralization dose ( ND ) sp of 0-1 mg/ml for 1 ng/ml of TNF-a .
This antibody was used at 10 mg/ml , i.e .
at least five-fold excess with respect to the amount necessary to neutralize the TNF- @ present in supernatants of PBMC treated with gp120 of IIIB strain ( 3-3 + 0-8 ng/ml ) [ 2 ] .
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of STAT 1 proteins PBMC from the various experimental conditions were collected after 18 h incubation , washed and lysed at 4°C for 15 min under agitation in RIPA modified buffer ( Tris-HCI 50 mm pH 7-4 , NP-40 1 % , Na-deoxycolate 0-25 % , NaCl 150 mm , EDTA 1 mm ) with the addition of : 1 mg/ml aprotinin , 1 mg/ml leupeptin and 1 mm PMSF .
The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 15 min at 4°C .
Protein concentration in clarified lysates was determined by Bradford assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .
About 30 ul of the clarified lysates , containing 30 mug of proteins , diluted 1:2 with SDS gel-loading buffer , were heated to 100°C for 5 min and loaded on 8 % acrylamide gel , for SDS-PAGE .
Then proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , utilizing a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus ( BioRad , Richmond , CA ) .
Nitrocellulose was then stained with Ponceau red solution to visualize the positions of standard proteins ( B-galactosidase , fructose 6-phosphate kinase and pyruvate kinase ; Sigma Aldrich , Milan , Italy ) .
Immunoblot was performed , after blocking nitrocellulose membrane in freshly prepared TBS containing 3 % dry milk , by using anti-STAT 1 MoAb ( anti-STAT 1a and B ( p91/84 ) , clone E-23 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) as primary antibody , followed by the sequential addition of anti-mouse biotin conjugate ( Sigma ) , streptavidin AP conjugate ( Boehringer Mann-heim , Milan , Italy ) and BCIP/NBT fast blue ( Sigma ) as chromogen .
RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction conditions for IRF-1 , ICE and B-actin mRNA detection Pellets of 5 x 10° PBMC from the various experimental conditions underwent total RNA extraction by Trizol ( Life Technologies , NY ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , in the indicated cases , by poly A+ mRNA purification by Oligotex mRNA kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) .
Reverse transcription of 3 Lg of total RNA extracted was performed by random hexamer method with M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase ( Perkin Elmer , Rome , Italy ) for 1 h at 42°C and then 15 min at 65°C .
For the detection of IRF-1 mRNA two different pairs of primers were utilized .
In limiting dilution analysis , cDNA was serially diluted and then amplified by using the following primers : AAGCATGCTGCCAAGCATGG-CTGG ( sense primer ) and ATCAGGCAGAGTGGAGCTGTC ( antisense primer ) .
The conditions of amplification were : 28 cycles ( 95°C for 35 s , 55°C for 2 min , 72°C for 2 min ) followed by a 15-min period at 72°C ; the size of the resulting amplicon was 363 bp [ 21 ] .
In the other experiments the sequences of the primers were the following : CCAGAGAAAAGAAAGAAAGTCG ( sense primer , 11GF ) and CACATGGCGACAGTGCTGG ( antisense primer , 12GF ) .
Amplification was carried out performing 30 cycles ( 94°C for 35 s , annealing at 62°C for 40 s and extension at 72°C for 1 min ) followed by 15 min at 72°C .
The size of the resulting amplicon was 206 bp [ 22 ] .
For the detection of ICE mRNA , the primers were : GCTATTAAGAAAGCCCA ( sense primer ) and TCAGTGGTGGGCATCTG ( antisense primer ) .
The amplification was carried out by 30 cycles ( 95°C for 35 s , annealing at 55°C for 2 min , and extension at 72°C for 2 min ) followed by a 15-min period at 72°C ; the size of the resulting amplicon was 221 bp [ 21 ] .
cDNA was also subjected to amplification for a housekeeping gene using primers specific for B-actin as described [ 23 ] , both to establish the suitability of the cDNA to be amplified , and to verify by serial dilution analysis the equal abundance of retrotranscribed material between the samples .
The amplified products were analysed by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV fluorescence after staining with ethidium bromide .
In some experiments , to evaluate the relative fluorescence intensity of the bands obtained in limiting dilution analysis of ICE mRNA , electrophoresis gel underwent analysis by Kodak Digital Science EDAS 120 System ( Life Technologies ) .
For calculation , the arbitrary value of 1000 was assigned to the undiluted sample of control PBMC .
To rule out possible contamination by DNA , we also amplified the resulting cDNA samples with primers specific for an intron-containing region of human HLA-DR as described [ 24 ] .
By this method , all RNA samples analysed resulted free of contaminating cellular DNA ( not shown ) .
Detection of apoptotic cell death by in situ TUNEL reaction Apoptotic cell death was visualized at single-cell level by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling ( TUNEL ) method , using a commercial kit from Boehringer Mannheim .
TUNEL reaction was performed on samples spotted onto slides for fluorescence analysis , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The samples were then analysed under a fluorescence microscope .
For each experiment , apoptotic cells were detected by examining for each sample at least four microscopy fields containing almost 100 cells .
The extent of apoptosis was expressed as percentage TUNEL * cells .
Caspase-3 activity determination Measurement of caspase-3 protease activity was performed in the © 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd , Clinical and Experimental Immunology , 122:374-380 376 lysed pellets of 3 x 10° PBMC from the various experimental conditions by a commercially available colourimetric assay ( Promega , Milan , Italy ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
As positive control , PBMC were exposed to apoptosis inducers such as M33 , a Fas agonistic MoAb ( Immunex , Seattle , WA ) at 10 mg/ml plus PHA at 1 mg/ml .
The experiments were also conducted in the presence of a specific pan-caspase inhibitor ( Z-VAD-FMK ) included in the kit .
Statistical analysis Statistical significance of the observed differences was evaluated using Student 's t-test on mean values from different experiments , as indicated .
RESULTS Stimulation of STAT 1 a and B proteins by HIV-1-infected cells , and effect of neutralizing antibodies to IFNs To study the effect of exposure to bystander HIV-infected cells on the levels of STAT 1 a and [ 3 proteins in normal PBMC , SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed in the lysates of PBMC co-cultivated for 18 h with HIV-infected or non-infected cells .
As positive control of STAT 1 induction , PBMC exposed to IFN-y ( 1000 U/ml ) were used .
As shown in Fig .
la , STAT 1 I. Abbate , F. Dianzani & M. R. Capobianchi a isoform is slightly more evident than the 3 isoform in unstimulated PBMC and in PBMC exposed to uninfected CD4 and H9 cells We could not discriminate whether differential expression , or differential affinity of the antibody , was responsible for a more pronounced visualization of the larger isoform in PBMC .
However , when analysing PBMC exposed to either CD4/ Bal .
or H9/IIIB cells , a proportional increase of both isoforms was observed .
As expected , a proportional increase of STAT 1 a and ( 3 protein levels was also observed in IFN-y-treated PBMC .
Induction experiments were also performed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IFN- and IFN-y , known to be able to up-regulate these proteins .
The results ( Fig .
1b ) indicate that up-regulation of STAT 1 proteins is abrogated by anti-IFN-a , but not by anti-IFN-y antibodies , suggesting that IFN- is the main cytokine responsible for the activation of STAT 1 when normal PBMC are exposed to HIV-1-infected cells .
Up-regulation of IRF-1 mRNA levels by HIV-1-infected cells and effect of neutralizing antibodies to IFNs and TNF-a To test the effect of exposure to bystander HIV-1-infected cells on the expression of IRF-1 and ICE , we measured IRF-1 and ICE mRNA levels in normal PBMC co-cultivated with HIV-1-infected cells , under the same experimental conditions used for STAT 1 experiments , by limiting dilution reverse transcriptase-polymerase ( a ) kD - \ 20 STAT la ~- me .

cDNA was then serially diluted and amplified as described in Materials and Methods .
Also in these experiments IFN-y at 1000 U/ml was used as positive control of IRF-1 and ICE mRNA induction .
As shown in Fig .

IFN regulatory factor ( IRF ) -1 and IL-1B-converting enzyme ( ICE ) mRNA levels in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) exposed to HIV-1-infected cells , and effect of antibodies to IFN- @ , IFN-y and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) .
( a ) Normal PBMC cultivated in the absence ( CTR ) or in the presence of cells infected with HIV ( H9/IIIB ) were collected after 18 h incubation .
As control IRF-1 inducer , IFN-y ( 1000 U/ml ) was used .
Extraction of total RNA and retrotranscription were performed as indicated in Materials and Methods .
For limiting dilution analysis , five serial five-fold dilutions of the retrotranscribed samples underwent polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers specific for IRF-1 ( first dilution corresponding to RNA extracted from 2 x 10° cells ) and for B-actin ( first dilution corresponding to RNA extracted from 2 x 10° cells ) .
( b ) Retrotranscribed samples from the same experimental conditions as in ( a ) underwent limiting dilution analysis for ICE mRNA .
The gel underwent digital analysis as described in Materials and Methods , and the results were expressed as relative intensity of fluorescence , assuming the arbitrary value of 1000 to the undiluted sample from control PBMC .
Under these conditions , B-actin values were superimposable for the three experimental conditions ( not shown ) .
( c ) Normal PBMC , stimulated with H9/IIIB infected cells , were cultivated either in the absence or in the presence of antibodies to IFN- , IFN-y , and TNF-a ( singularly or mixed ) .
Unstimulated PBMC ( CTR ) represented baseline expression level .
Cells were collected after 18 h incubation .
As control IRF-1 inducer , IFN-y ( 1000 U/ml ! )
was used .
Amounts of purified poly A+ mRNA corresponding to 2 x 10° cells for each sample were retrotranscribed , and amplified using the primers for IRF-1 ( 11GF and 12GF ) .The results shown are representative of three independent experiments .

Therefore , we measured the proteolytic activity of one of the effector caspases ( i.e .
caspase-3 ) in lysates of PBMC co-cultivated with H9/IIIB cells .
As a control of caspase-3 activity induction , we used a Fas agonistic MoAb ( M33 ) together with PHA stimulation .
The results indicate that H9/IMIB cells do not induce caspase-3 activity , whereas anti-Fas antibody plus PHA increase this activity in PBMC , and this enhancement is almost completely abrogated ( 88 + 10 % inhibition ) by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK ( not shown ) .
To establish whether induction of apoptosis by HIV-1-infected cells could be mediated by soluble factors , we used neutralizing antibodies against some of the cytokines induced by HIV-1 and possibly involved in apoptosis , namely IFN- , IFN-y and TNF-a .
In situ TUNEL reaction revealed that , among the antibodies tested , anti-TNF- @ was the most effective in reducing the extent of apoptosis induced by HIV-infected cells .
A significant , but less pronounced , inhibition of apoptosis was also observed when antibodies to IFN-y were used , whereas antibodies to IFN- were completely ineffective .
The mixture of the all three antibodies was the most effective , as expected ( Fig .
3b ) .
DISCUSSION In this study we show that exposure to HIV-1-infected cells may trigger , in normal PBMC , signal transduction pathways related mainly to IFN-a effector functions .
Particularly , we observed an enhanced level of STAT 1 proteins and an increased amount of IRF-1 mRNA .
It has been reported that in PBMC from HIV-1-infected subjects in all stages of the disease there is a decrease of STAT5A , STAT5B , and STAT 1 a protein expression , probably as a consequence of chronic activation of certain signal transduction patterns by dysregulated cytokine production , that can be , in turn , exhausted or down-modulated .
Furthermore , in vitro infection of normal PBMC determines a selective decrease in STATS5B protein levels , depending on the viral strain [ 17 ] .
We have previously shown that cells infected with either a T-tropic ( X4 ) or monocytotropic ( R5 ) HIV-1 strain co-induce a number of cytokines , including IFN-a and IFN-y , giving rise to an enhanced antiviral activity referred to as acid-labile IFN- [ 12,13 ] .
In this study we report that IFN-a induced by HIV-1 is mainly responsible for the enhanced in vitro levels of STAT 1 a and B proteins in normal PBMC .
This phenomenon may be related to increased amounts of IRF-1 mRNA transcripts , that , in turn , seem to be subsequent to IFN-a induction , as suggested by experiments performed with anti-cytokine antibodies .
Even if other mechanisms , such as TNF-mediated NF-KB activation , may induce activation of IRF-1 gene expression [ 22,25 ] , we did not observe abrogation of IRF-1 mRNA increase by anti-TNF- @ .
These data do not allow us to delineate whether increased IRF-1 mRNA levels are due to enhanced transcription or to decreased degradation .
Moreover , it can not be ruled out that HIV-1 , per se , can directly cause an additional IRF-1 mRNA induction , as has been demonstrated in human epithelial cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) [ 21 ] .
In this study , we also explored the possibility that exposure to HIV-infected cells can induce apoptosis in normal PBMC .
We first showed that in co-cultures of PBMC with cells infected with either X4 or R5 strains of HIV-1 there is a dose-dependent increase of apoptotic cell death .
The extent of apoptosis observed in our experimental system was similar to that showed by others using HIV-infected cells [ 26 ] .
It is likely that gp120 , exposed on the surface of HIV-infected cells , is the main protein responsible for the triggering of apoptosis in target cells , since it has been reported that cross-linking of CD4 molecules by gp120 leads to apoptotic death of lymphocytes [ 27 ] .
Furthermore , in previous experiments we have observed that , similarly to HIV-infected fixed cells , soluble recombinant gp120 is able to induce a small fraction of PBMC to undergo apoptosis [ 28 ] .
Recently it has also been demonstrated that chemokine receptors may be involved in apoptosis induction by HIV-1 through membrane mechanisms [ 11,29 ] .
In this view , it has been suggested that X4 strains and SDF-1 are more effective than R5 strains and B-chemokines in the induction of apoptosis [ 30 ] , but it does not seem to be the case in our conditions , since a similar extent and dose-dependence of apoptosis was observed when using a R5 compared with a X4 strain .
We explored the possibility that apoptosis induction by HIV-1 may be a consequence of an increased secretion of soluble pro-apoptotic mediators , such as TNF-a and IFNs that are secreted by PBMC in response to either HIV-1 Bal .
or IIIB ( [ 16 ] and our data not shown ) .
The results indicate that antibodies directed to TNF-a significantly inhibit apoptosis induction by HIV-infected cells , whereas the abrogation is less pronounced with antibodies to IFN-y , and is absent with antibodies to IFN-a .
This means that TNF-a and , to a lesser extent , IFN-y , are the main cytokines responsible for apoptosis after 18 h exposure to HIV-infected cells .
In fact , we have previously observed that TNF-a is induced in PBMC cultures with kinetics very similar to that of IFN-a , reaching a plateau after 1 day of stimulation with either gp120 or HIV-infected cells , whereas IFN-y , although detectable at day 1 of induction , is released with a much slower kinetics , reaching peak values 3 days later [ 13 ] .
TNF-mediated apoptosis in HIV-1 infection has been well documented in the past years , also in the CD8 compartment .
In fact , it has been shown that gp120 is able to up-regulate membrane TNF-a on macrophages and TNF-a receptors on CDS cells , leading to increased apoptosis of these cells [ 31 ] .
It should be pointed out that TNF-a may induce cell apoptosis by several mechanisms , which can be partially related or not to the caspase cascade ( i.e .
sphingomyelinase/ceramide pathway ) [ 32,33 ] .
However , although we have observed a small increase of ICE mRNA in PBMC exposed to HIV-infected cells , concomitant with IRF-1 mRNA induction , we were unable to detect enhanced proteolytic activity attributable to one of the later proteases in the caspase cascade ( i.e .
caspase-3 ) .
Therefore , it is likely that the DNA fragmentation in PBMC stimulated with HIV-infected cells could involve effector mechanisms , not necessarily involving the entire caspase cascade .
There is substantial evidence that anti-tumour effects of the IFNs are at least in part mediated by STAT 1 protein activation and IRF-1 expression , that can , in turn , induce tumour cell apoptosis [ 34,35 ] .
Nevertheless , the two IFN types are reported to play different roles in apoptosis induction .
Several data showed that IFN-y exerts a promoting activity in the apoptosis of leucocytes , mainly through the up-regulation of Fas/FasL molecules , whereas IFN- may protect activated T cells from apoptotic death [ 36-38 ] .
Accordingly , in our experimental system antibodies to IFN-y , and not to IFN- « a , inhibit apoptosis induction by HIV-1-infected cells .
Our findings may have possible physiological relevance , in view of the fact that altered levels and function of signal © 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd , Clinical and Experimental Immunology , 122:374-380 Induction of signal transduction and apoptosis by HIV-1-infected cells 379 ( a ) % % 4 |- hi % , ’ 5 ( b ) € * 10 8 5 3 8 o 8 F a 2 6 0 o .5 8 o a © o & a 2 a # 0 4 0 2 0 o_ 2 1 I I I o 100 200 300 Inducer ( cells/ml x 1000 ) Iliii H9/IB _ Anti-IFN- « @ Anti-IFN-y Anti-TNF- « Antibody mix Fig .

Induction of apoptosis in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) exposed to HIV-l-infected cells , and effect of antibodies to IFN-a , IFN-y and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) .
( a ) Normal PBMC were exposed to increasing amounts of HIV-1-infected cells ( either CD4/BaL ( ) or H9/IIIB ( @ ) ) for 18 h. Detection of apoptosis was performed by in site TUNEL reaction .
Data are expressed as fold increase over control values ( mean *s.e.m .
over three independent experiments ) of apoptosis detected by immunofluorescence .
The frequency of apoptotic cells in control PBMC cultures or in PBMC exposed to uninfected cells ranged from 1-65 % to 2:38 % in the various experiments .
*P < 0-05 ; **P < 0-001 versus control in Student 's t-test .
( b ) Apoptosis in PBMC stimulated with H9/IIIB , either in the absence or in the presence of antibodies to IFN-a , IFN-y , and TNF-a ( singly or mixed ) .
Unstimulated PBMC ( CTR ) represent baseline apoptosis levels .
After 18 h incubation , cells underwent in sity TUNEL reaction .
Data represent mean percentage values *s.e.m .
over three separate experiments .
Statistical significance : H9/IIB versus CTR , P = 0-001 ; anti-IFN-y versus H9/IIIB , P = 0-036 ; anti-TNF- « versus H9/IIIB , P = 0-003 ; and antibody mixture versus H9/IIIB , P = 0-006 , Student 's test .
transduction mediators ( such as STAT proteins ) are commonly observed in HIV-infected patients , concomitantly with chronic stimulation of cytokine production and increased commitment to apoptosis .
Our results suggest that these phenomena can be indirectly triggered in uninfected PBMC by bystander infected cells .
It is likely that the overall effect of HIV-infected cells on apoptosis induction in PBMC could be due to the balance of different cytokines which possess pro- or anti-apoptotic activities .
Additional studies may be needed to better elucidate the relative importance of these factors in determining lymphocyte activation and apoptosis .
