One site is similar to activated TNFRII in associating with TNFR-associated factors TRAF1 and TRAF2 , and the second site is similar to TNFRI in associating with the TNFRI death domain interacting protein TRADD .
TNFRI has been recently shown to activate NF-xB through association with TRADD , RIP , and TRAF2 ; activation of the NF-B-inducing kinase ( NIK ) ; activation of the IxBa kinases ( IKKa and IKK ) ; and phosphorylation of IxBa .
IxBa phosphorylation on Ser-32 and Ser-36 is followed by its degradation and NF-KB activation .
In this report , we show that activation by LMP1 or by each of its effector sites is mediated by a pathway that includes NIK , IKKa , and IKK 3 .
Dominant negative mutants of NIK , IKKa , or IKK 3 substantially inhibited activation by LMP1 or by each of its effector sites .
The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latent infection membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) is a key effector of EBV-mediated effects on cell growth .
Genetic analyses with EBV recombinants indicate that LMP1 is essential for the conversion of resting human B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) ( 1 ) .
In non-EBV-infected Burkitt 's tumor lymphoblasts , LMP1 can induce most of the phenotypic changes associated with EBV transformation of resting human B lymphocytes including induction of adhesion molecule expression , activation of NF- « B , up-regulation of Bel-2 , and activation of stress-activated protein kinase ( for review , see refs .
2-8 ) .
LMP1 can also transform immortalized rodent fibroblast cell lines to loss of contact inhibition , lower serum dependence , anchorage inde-pendence , and tumorigenicity in nude mice ( 9-11 ) .
LMP1 is likely to alter cell growth by mimicking a constitutively activated tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) similar to TNFRII and TNFRI , CD40 , or CD30 ( 12-14 ) .
LMP1 has a short 24-amino acid cytoplasmic N terminus , six transmembrane domains connected by short turns , and a 200-amino acid cytoplasmic C terminus ( CCT ) ( ref .
2 and Fig .
1 ) .
The cytoplasmic N terminus anchors the first transmembrane domain , and deletion of any specific codon does not ablate the ability of the mutated EBV recombinant to transform B lymphocytes into LCLs ( 15 ) .
The transmembrane domains enable LMP1 to aggregate in the plasma membrane .

10106 Aggregation in the plasma membrane is essential for activity because EBV recombinants that express a nonaggregating mutant LMP1 that diffusely distributes in the plasma membranes are unable to convert B lymphocytes into LCLs ( 1 ) .
Another nonaggregating mutant that diffusely distributes in all cytoplasmic membranes does not induce phenotypic changes in B lymphocytes or rodent fibroblasts or induce NF- « B ( 2 , 4-6 , 10 , 11 , 16 ) .
The LMP1 CCT is also essential for the transformation of resting B lymphocytes into LCLs ( 17 ) .
An EBV recombinant that expresses only the N terminus , the transmembrane domains , and the first 45 amino acids of the CCT can initiate B cell growth transformation and some of the infected cells can grow into long-term LCLs ( 17 ) .
These first 45 amino acids of the CCT include a site that can bind TNFR -associated factors ( TRAFs ) ( 12 , 13 , 18 ) .
These same 45 amino acids mediate a minor component of the LMP NF-KB activation and have been referred to as the C-terminal activation region 1 ( CTAR1 ) ( 4 , 5 ) .
A 27-codon deletion in LMP1 that includes this TRAF-binding site renders EBV recombinants incompetent for B lymphocyte growth transfor-mation , consistent with the hypothesis that the TRAF binding site is a key transformation effector site ( TES1 ; ref .
19 ) .
A second transformation effector site ( TES2 ) maps to the last few residues of the CCT ( 14 ) .
TES2 associates with the TNFR1 death domain interacting protein TRADD ( 14 ) and correlates with the major NF- « B-activating domain ( 4 , 5 , 14 , 20 ) .
TES1 and TES2 are within the C-terminal NF- « B activation regions 1 and 2 ( CTAR1 and CTAR2 ) that mediate 30 % and 70 % , respectively , of LMP1-induced NF-KB activation ( 5 , 12 , 16 ) .
Binding of TRAF1 and TRAF2 to TES1 mediates NF-KB activation from CTAR1 , whereas TRADD binding to TES2 mediates NF-KB activation from CTAR2 ( 13 , 14 ) .
The genetic linkage of LMP1 effector sites for cell growth transformation with effector sites for NF-kB activation and the key role of NF-KB in lymphocyte activation ( 21 ) are compatible with the working hypotheses that TRAFs and TRADD are key mediators of LMP1 effects in cell growth transformation and that NF-KB is an important component of those effects .
Pursuant to the linkage of NF- « B activation with LMP1 effects on B lymphocyte growth , we now further investigate the molecular mechanism through which LMP1 mediates NF-KB activation .

TRAF1 , TRAF2 , and TRAF3 constitutively associate with the LMP1-proximal NF- « B-activating region ( CTAR1 ) , which is also a key transformation effector site ( TES1 ) .
TRADD constitutively associates with the LMP1 distal and major NF- « B-activating domain ( CTAR2 ) , which is a second transformation effector site ( TES2 ) .
Aggregation of TRAF2 most likely activates NIK , which in turn phosphorylates and activates IKKa and IKK .

To evaluate the role of this pathway in LMP1-induced NF-KB activation , we have studied the effect of dominant-negative mutants of NIK , IKKa , or IKKB on LMP1-induced NF-kB activation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Constructs .
The expression constructs of wild-type human NIK and a dominant negative `` inactive '' mutant of NIK with Lys-429 and Lys-430 mutated to Ala ( NIK KK429-430AA ) have been described ( 22 ) .
Full-length LMP1 , LMP1 lacking the membrane distal NF- « B-activating domain ( FLMPA232-386 ; referred to as F-LMPCTAR1 ) , or LMP1 lacking the membrane-proximal NF- « B-activating domain ( FLMPA188-351 ; referred to as F-LMPCTAR2 ) subcloned in pCDNA3 were obtained from W. Miller ( 28 ) .
pSGS-F-LMP1 is described elsewhere ( 13 ) .
F designates the presence of a FLAG epitope in the N terminus .
Human IxBa and IxBa mutants were subcloned into pGEM4 .
The Myc-tagged wild-type IKKa and the dominant negative mutant IKKaKA44A ( M-IKKa and M-IKKaK44A ; ref .
23 ) subcloned in pRKS were obtained from M. Rothe and D. Goeddel .
Cloning of IKK .
The National Center for Biotechnology Information DNA database was screened for sequences similar to the IKKa sequence ( 23 , 25 ) .
An expressed sequence tag ( EST ; GenBank accession no .
W68756 ) was identified .
The EST sequence aligned with the C terminus ( amino acids 624-658 ) of IKKa .
From this EST sequence , gene-specific primers were designed and used to amplify by PCR the cDNA ( s ) containing upstream sequences from a human B lymphoma cDNA library ( Advantage cDNA polymerase mix-ture , CLONTECH ) .
Two cDNA products whose sequences were similar to IKKa were fused with the downstream sequence in the EST clone ( purchased from Genome Systems ) to obtain pIKK $ B-1 and pIKKB-2 .
The sequences of pIKKB-1 and pIKKB-2 were later found to be identical to the corre- Proc .

In addi-tion , pIKKB-2 contained the transition A - > G at the second base of the codon 242 as compared with the published IKKB sequence .
The resulting IKKB sequences from pIKKB-1 and pIKKB-2 were then fused in-frame downstream of the FLAG-epitope-encoding sequence in pCDNA3 to create pCDNA3-FLAG-IKKBA9 and pCDN3-FLAG-IKKBA34 , respectively .
Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays .
Plasmid DNA was introduced into human embryonic kidney 293 cells by elec-troporation ( 6 ) or using the `` superfect '' kit ( Qiagen , Chats-worth , CA ) .
In the latter case , 24 h before transfection , 5 X 10° cells per well were seeded in six-well plates with 2 ml of DMEM containing 10 % ( D10 ) fetal bovine serum .
Plasmid DNAs were mixed with 10 ul of superfect in 150 ul of DMEM without serum .
After 10 min at room temperature , the transfection mixture was dripped to the wells .
The medium was changed to D10 after 4 h. All transfections included an expression plasmid , 0.5 ug of a luciferase reporter gene containing three NF-KB sites ( 4 ) , and 0.5 ug of a control B-galactosidase expression construct ( pGK gal ) to normalize for transfection efficiency ( 6 , 13 ) .
Sixteen to 24 h after transfection , cells were harvested and washed with PBS .
Cell extracts were used to determine luciferase and B-gal activities , and protein expression level was determined by Western blotting .
Immune Precipitation and Western Blotting .
The 293 cells were harvested , washed once with D10 and once with PBS , transferred to a microcentrifuge tube , and incubated for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris-HC ] , pH 7.4/150 mM NaCl/2 mM EDTA/O.5 % Nonidet P-40/3 % glycerol/1 mM phenyImethylsulfonyl fluoride /leupeptin ( 5 ug/ml ) /aprotinin ( 2 ug/ml ) ] .
Lysates were precleared with CL-6B Sepharose for 1 h and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads ( Kodak ) for 1-2 h at 4°C .
The M2 beads were used for Western blotting and for kinase assays .
Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and were transferred to 0.45-um ( pore size ) nitrocellulose sheets and detected by Western blotting with enhanced chemiluminescence .
FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with the MS mouse mAB ( Eastman Kodak ) ; non-FLAG tagged LMP1 was detected with mouse $ 12 anti-LMP 6 ) .
( ) In Vitro Kinase Assays .
The kinase reactions were in 50 ul of kinase assay buffer ( 50 mM TrisHCl , pH 7.5/5 mM MgCl ; /5 mM NaF/2 mM ATP ) containing in vitro-translated 35S-labeled IxBa that was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( TNT , Promega ) .
Unlabeled ATP ( 20 mM ) and [ y- > 2P ] JATP ( 25 wCi ) were included in the kinase reaction with IKKBA9 .
After incubation for 20 min or 1 h at 30°C , the reactions were terminated by adding 2X SDS sample buffer and boiling , followed by SDS/PAGE , Western blotting , and autoradiography .
For immunoprecipitated proteins , the M2 beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase wash buffer ( 50 mM TrisHCl , pH 7.5/5 mM MgCl ; /5 mM NaF ) before incubation in the kinase reaction buffer .
RESULTS A Dominant-Negative NIK Mutant Inhibits LMP1-Induced NF-xB Activation .
To determine whether NIK is a mediator of LMP1-induced NF- « B activation , we examined the effect of a dominant negative kinase-site mutant NIK ( NIK KK429-430AA ) on LMP1-induced NF- « B activation in 293 cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
Activation was measured through effects on a cotransfected luciferase reporter with three upstream NF-KB sites ( 4 ) .
In each experiment , LMP1 with a deletion of CTAR2 ( LMPC-TAR1 ) induced ~25 % of the total LMP1 effect , whereas 10108 _ Medical Sciences : Sylla et al .

Dominant negative mutant of protein kinase NIK ( NI-KKK429-430AA ) inhibits NF-KB activation by LMP1 .
( 4 ) A luciferase reporter plasmid with three upstream NF- « B binding sites was electroporated into 293 cells with a control B-galactosidase expression construct ( GKfgal ) , and pCDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) -based expression plasmids for LMP1 ( 5 ug ) , F-LMPCTAR1 ( 10 ug ) , or F-LMPCTAR2 ( 10 ug ) in the presence or absence of pCDNA3NIK KK429-430AA ( referred as INIK ) ( 10 ug ) .
Luciferase activities were normalized for cotransfected B-galactosidase activity .
Values of NF-KB activation in the presence of NIKKK429-430AA were normalized to the corresponding activities ( set at 100 % ) obtained in the absence NIKKK429-430AA .
Mean values ( +SD ) of relative luciferase activities from four experiments are shown .
In these four experiments , NF- « B activation by full-length LMP1 was an average of 29-fold , whereas LMPCTAR1 induced I9-fold and LMPCTAR2 induced 19-fold NF- « B activation .
( B ) Western blot of LMP1 expression in the presence and absence of NIKKK429-430AA ( INIK ) .
LMP1 was detected with the S12 monoclonal antibody .
( C ) Western blot of F-LMPCTAR1 and F-LMPCTAR2 expression in the presence and absence of NIKKK429-430AA ( INIK ) .
FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with the MS monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody .
LMP1 with a deletion of CTAR1 ( LMPCTAR2 ) induced about 75 % of the LMP1 effect .
The dominant negative NIK inhibited 50 % or more of the NF- « B-activation that was induced by full-length LMP1 , by LMPCTAR1 , or by LMPCTAR2 ( Fig .
24 and data not shown ) .
The inhibition of NF-kB activation by dominant negative NIK was not due to an effect of the dominant negative NIK on expression of the various LMP1 proteins ( Fig .
2 B and C ) .
These results suggest that NIK can substantially affect or mediate NF- « B activation by LMP1 , LMPCTAR1 , and CTAR2 .
NIK Induces IxBa Phosphorylation on Ser-32 and Ser-36 in Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysates .
NIK activation by TNF treatment or overexpression leads to degradation of IxBa , NIK KK429-430AA blocks TNF- or interleukin 1-induced NF- « B activation ( 22 ) , and phosphorylation of IxBa on Ser-32 and Ser-36 can signal its ubiquitination and degradation after TNF treatment ( 29 ) .
We sought to further analyze the role of NIK in NF-KB activation by evaluating whether NIK is capable of inducing phosphorylation of IxBa on Ser-32 and Ser-36 , in vitro .
Wild-type and Ser - > Ala mutated forms of IxBa were incubated under standard kinase reaction conditions in reticulocyte lysate in the presence ( Fig .
3 , lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) or absence of NIK ( Fig .
3 , lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ) .

NIK induces IxBa phosphorylation on Ser-32 and Ser-36 .
In vitro-translated *°S-labeled NIK and *S-labeled wild-type IxBa , $ 32/36A , S32A , or S36A mutants were incubated in a standard kinase buffer and were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and autoradiography .

These data indicate that NIK-induced phosphorylation of IxBa ( as judged by gel retardation ) is dependent on Ser-32 and Ser-36 .
To determine whether NIK phosphorylates I « xBa directly or requires other cellular factor ( s ) from the reticulocyte lysate , FLAG-tagged NIK ( F-NIK ) and IxBa were purified by immunoprecipitation and incubated in a standard kinase reac-tion .
Incubation of in vifro-translated F-NIK with in vitro-translated IxBa in reticulocyte lysate resulted in IxBa phosphorylation ( Fig .
4 , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In vitro-translated F-NIK could also phosphorylate immune affinity-purified in vitro-translated IxBa ( Fig .
4 , lane 5 ) .
However , immune affinity-purified F-NIK was unable to phosphorylate immune affinity-purified IxBa , even when the affinity-purified F-NIK was preincubated with reticulocyte lysate to restore it to an active phosphorylated state ( Fig .
4 , lane 4 , and data not shown ) .
Only when the immune affinity-purified , preincu-bated , and phosphorylated F-NIK was added to in vitro-translated IxBa in reticulocyte lysate was IxBa phosphorylated ( Fig .
4 , lane 3 , and data not shown ) .
These data indicate that phosphorylated NIK requires additional factor ( s ) from the reticulocyte lysate for IxBa phosphorylation .

was identified as a NIK -interacting kinase and as part of an IxB kinase complex involved in NF- « B activation ( 23 , 25 ) .
IKKS was identified as a homologue of IKKa and as a component of the high molecular weight complex that phosphorylates IxBa in response to treatment of cells with TNF-a ( 24 , 26 , 27 ) .
To evaluate the role of IKKa and IKK in LMP1-induced NF-kB activation , we examined the effect of dominant negative IKKa or IKK on LMP1-induced NF- « B activation in 293 cells .
The dominant negative IKKa ( IKKaK44A ) that inhibited TNF-induced NF- « B activation ( 23 , 25 ) also inhibited LMP1- , LMPCTAR1- , and LMPCTAR2-mediated NF- « B activation ( Fig .
54 ) .
The inhibition was dose-dependent and was not attributable to a direct effect of IKKaKA44A on LMP1 expression because the levels of wild-type or mutant LMP1 proteins were not significantly affected by IKKaK44A expression ( Fig .
5B and data not shown for LMPCTAR1 and LMPCTAR2 ) .
Thus , IKKa affects or mediates LMP1- , LMPCTAR1- , or LMPCTAR2-induced NF-KB activation .
To investigate the role of IKK in LMP1-induced NF-kB activation , two IKKB cDNA clones were isolated from a human B cell cDNA library .
One cDNA , IKKBA9 , is missing nine N-terminal codons and activated the NF- « B-dependent reporter 15-fold ( data not shown ) , similar to full-length IKK ( 23 ) .
A second cDNA , IKKBA34 , is missing 34 N-terminal residues , including the ATP-binding site .

IKKBA34 also inhibited NF- « B activation by full-length LMP1 by 80 % , by LMPCTAR1 by approximately 50 % , and by LMPCTAR2 by 70 % ( Fig .
5C ) .
The inhibitions were dose-dependent and did not reach saturation at the highest level of transfected DNA tested ( Fig .
5D and data not shown ) .
The more modest effect of IKKBA34 on LMPCTAR1-induced NF- « B activation is unlikely to be due to a substantive difference in the role of IKK in LMPCTAR1 versus LMPCTAR2 downstream pathways and is more likely due to the higher level of LMPCTAR1 expression compared with LMPCTAR2 ( Fig .
2C and data for each experiment not shown ) .
Consistent with this hypothesis , NF- « B activation induced by smaller amounts of LMPCTAR1 expression vector was 80 % inhibited by IKKBA34 ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that IKKB also affects or mediates LMP1 , LMPCTAR1 , and LMPCTARZ induced NF-KB activation .
Overexpression of wild-type IKKa or IKKB potentiates TNF-induced NF- « B activation in 293 cells , and this is consistent with their role in mediating TNF-induced NF-kB activation ( 23-27 ) .
Although overexpression of IKKa or IKK B in 293 cells resulted in NF- « B activation ( data not shown ) , high-level IKKa or IKK coexpression with LMP1 resulted in less NF-KB activation than was induced by LMP1 alone ( Fig .

F-LMP1 ( 4 ug ) in pSGS5 , F-LMPCTAR1 ( 0.5 ug ) , or F-LMPCTARZ ( 1 ug ) in pCDNA3 were cotransfected with a 3XxB luciferase reporter gene plasmid , a B-galactosidase expression construct , and increasing amounts ( 0.1-2 ug ) of pRKS5-myc-IKKaK44A , pCDN3-F-IKKBA34 , or pCDNA3 , a vector control .
Because of the high expression of F-LMPCTAR1 relative to F-LMP1 and LMPCTAR2 , 0.5-2 ug of myc-IKKaK44A and IKKBA34 were cotransfected with LMPCTAR1 .
Luciferase activities were normalized for B-galactosidase activities .
NF- « B activation by LMP1 constructs cotransfected with IKKaK44A or IKKBA34 were normalized to the activities ( set at 100 % ) obtained in the absence of IKKaK44A or IKKBA34 .
In these experiments LMP1-induced NF-KB activation averaged 76-fold , whereas LMPCTAR1-induced activation averaged 17-fold and LMPCTAR2-induced activation averaged 53-fold .

Despite its negative effects on LMP1-induced NF-KB activation , Flag-tagged IKK immunoprecipitated from 293 cells was able to phosphorylate IxBa in kinase buffer , in vitro .
IKKB immunoprecipitated from LMP1 expressing cells was not more active in phosphorylating I « xBa in vitro than IKK B from LMP1-negative 293 cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , these results are consistent with IKKa and IKK being important mediators of LMP1-induced NF-KB activation but raise questions about the precise stoichiometry or regulation of this pathway ( see Discussion ) .
DISCUSSION TNF signaling through TNFRI has been well characterized in epithelial cells , such as the 293 cells that we used ( 22-27 , 29-37 ) .
In such cells TNF induces trimerization of TNFRI .
TNFRI associates with TRADD and RIP .
TRADD and RIP associate with TRAF1 and 2 .
TRAF2 associates and probably activates NIK .
NIK activates IKKa and IKK .
IK Ka and IKK B phosphorylate IkBa , which is then ubiquitinated and de-graded , releasing active NF-kB .
Although epithelial cells primarily express TNFRI , cells of bone marrow origin primarily express TNFRII .
TNF also induces trimerization of TNFRII and the downstream pathways appear to only differ in the ability of trimerized TNFRII to directly engage TRAF1 and TRAF2 , rather than indirectly engaging TRAF1 and TRAF2 through TRADD and RIP ( 22 , 38 , 39 ) .
For both TNFR I and TNFRII , NIK activation appears to be mediated by TRAF2 ( 22 ) .
Our in vitro observations that NIK indirectly induces phosphorylation of IxBa on Ser-32 and Ser-36 are consistent with and extend previous data showing that NIK induces IxBa phosphorylation and activates NF-KB in transfected 293 cells ( 22 ) .
The experiments described herein indicate that the EBV-transforming protein LMP1 induces NF-KB activation through a NIK- , IKKa- , and IKK 3-kinase-dependent pathway ( Fig .

Dominant negative forms of NIK , IKKa , or IKKB blocked LMP1-induced NF- « B activation without affecting LMP1 ex-pression .
Because NIK and the IxBa kinases are implicated in the pathways through which TNF induces NF- « B activation , these results are consistent with previous evidence that LMP1 signals through cellular pathways that are ordinarily activated by TNF and other TNF family ligands .
LMP1 activates NF-kB from CTAR1 by associating with TRAF1 and TRAF2 and from CTARZ by associating with TRADD ( 12-14 , 18 ) , in striking parallel to both TNFRII and TNFRI pathways .
Because of the previous evidence linking TRAF1 , TRAF2 , and TRADD to LMPCTAR1- and CTAR2 Proc .

USA 95 ( 1998 ) mediated NF-KB activation , we anticipated that LMPCTAR1-and CTAR2-induced NF- « B activation would be inhibited by coexpression of dominant negative forms of NIK , IKKa , or IKK3 .
Indeed , NIK KK429-430A¥ A inhibited LMP1- , LMPCTAR1- , or LMPCTAR2-induced NF- « B activation by at least 50 % and did not inhibit LMPCTAR1 or LMPCTAR2 expression , indicating that NIK is a mediator of LMPCTAR1- and LMPCTAR2-induced NF-KB activation in 293 cells .
Because activated NIK complexes with and activates IKKa and to a lesser extent IKKB ( 23-27 , 36 , 37 ) , which then phosphorylate IxBa , expression of dominant negative forms of IKKa or IKKB also blocked LMPCTAR1- and CTAR2-mediated NF-kB activation .
However , LMPCTAR1-induced NF-KB activation was somewhat more resistant to IKKBA34 blockage than was LMPCTAR2-induced NF-kB activation .
This effect was attributed to the higher level of LMPCTAR1 expression versus LMPCTAR2 .
Indeed , lower-level expression of LMPCTAR1 resulted in substantial blockage by IKKBA34 .
However , LMPCTAR1 was also less inhibited by IKKBA34 than it was by IKKa K44A .
This latter effect may be due to a differential low expression of IKKBA34 versus IKKa K44A or to a larger pool size of wild-type IKK .
Consistent with these possibilities , IKKBA34 was also less effective than IKKa K44A in inhibiting LMP1 and LMPCTAR2 as well as LMPCTAR1 .
Attempts to further investigate potential differences in expression levels between IKKBA34 and IKKa K44A have so far been unrevealing , in part due to the different epitope tags .
The similar effects of dominant negative NIK , IKKa , and IKK on NF-KB activation mediated by LMPCTAR1 and LMPCTAR2 are altogether most consistent with the hypothesis that the fundamental differences between the effects of CTAR1/TES1 and CTAR2/TES2 on cell growth and gene activation are due to differences in biochemical interactions upstream of NIK , IKKa , and IKK activation .
Given the similarity of LMP1 to TNFRI and TNFRII and the previous finding that IKKa or IKK overexpression stimulated TNF-mediated NF-KB activation , we were surprised that overexpression of wild-type IKKa or IKK inhibited LMP1-induced NF-KB activation and that LMP1 expression did not potentiate IKK-induced phosphorylation of IxBa « .
One explanation for these results could be the possibility that high-level expression of these kinases may alter the normal stoichiometry of the signal transduction cascade .
For example , overexpression of IKKa or IKK may sequester key regulatory factor ( s ) necessary for NF- « B activation .
Alternatively , IKKa and IKK B may already be in relative molar excess versus IxBa and overexpression simply increases interaction with other targets or regulators of these kinases without positively affecting the efficiency of IxBa phosphorylation .
LMP1 may differ in these effects from TNFRs because of their association with other putative signaling molecules ( 40 , 41 ) , which may indirectly affect NF-KB activation .
The summary drawing of LMP1 induced NF-KB activation ( Fig .
1 ) includes several areas of uncertainty .
For example , although TRAFs and TRADD are constitutively associated with LMP1 in EBV -transformed B lymphocytes or transfected 293 cells ( 12 , 13 , 18 ) , NIK , IKKa , and IKK are likely to be in a separate neighboring complex .
By immune microscopy , TR AFs significantly colocalize to LMP1 patches in the plasma membrane ( 12 , 18 ) , whereas IKKa or IKKB are much less LMP1-associated and are evident throughout the cytoplasm ( data not shown ) .
Further , although TRAFs or TRADD readily coimmunoprecipitate with LMP1 ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 18 ) , we have been unable to coimmunoprecipitate NIK , IKKa , or IKKG with LMP1 from cells cotransfected with expression vectors for LMP1 and epitope-tagged NIK , IKKa , or IKK .
In summary , these experiments indicate that NIK , IKKa , and IKKS are effectors of NF- « B activation from CTAR1/ TES1 and CTAR2/TES2 and confirm the functional similarity of these sites to the TRAF and TRADD binding domains of Medical Sciences : Sylla et al .
TNFR II and TNFRI , respectively .
However , although LMPC-TAR2/TES2 associates with TRADD and propagates robust NF- « B activation presumably through the recruitment of TRAF1 and TRAF to the TRADD N terminus , LMPC-TAR2/TES2 interacts with only a part of the TRADD death domain and does not propagate a discernable proapoptotic signal through TRADD ( 14 ) .
Thus , LMP1 differs partially from TNFRI in TRADD-mediated signaling .
