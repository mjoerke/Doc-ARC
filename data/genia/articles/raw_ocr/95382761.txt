Although the interrelationship between the two messengers Ca** and cyclic AMP in platelet function is well documented , its mechanism of action still remains to be established .
We investigated here the question of the regulation of platelet Ca**-ATPases by cyclic AMP through the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein using a pathological model .
We first found experimental conditions where Ca** transport by platelet membrane vesicles appeared to be dependent on the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein .
Then , we studied platelets of patients with congestive heart failure for their expression of the potential 97 kDa Ca**-ATPase target of regulation through the Rapl protein as well as the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein using the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase ( C .
Sub . ) .
In the first patients studied , we found no significant modification in the expression of the 97 kDa Ca**-ATPase by Western blotting using the PL/IM 430 monoclonal antibody which specifically recognized this isoform .
In contrast , the Rapl protein was differentially phosphorylated when using 15 ug/ml of the C. Sub .
These results allowed us to use these pathological platelets to study the relationship between the expression of Rapl protein and the regulation of Ca** transport by selecting a patient with severe heart failure .
We could show a decrease in the expression as well as in the phosphorylation of Rapl protein and demonstrate a lower effect of C. Sub .
on Ca®* transport .
Finally , by studying a further series of patients , we could confirm that the decrease in Rapl protein expression in heart failure , whatever its extent , was variable , and could strictly correlate the expression of Rapl protein with the stimulatory effect of C. Sub .
on Ca** transport .
Besides the evidence for regulation of the expression of the Rapl1 protein in platelets from patients with heart failure , these findings constitute a new approach in favour of the regulation of platelet Ca** transport through the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein .
INTRODUCTION The regulation of platelet cytosolic Ca** concentration involves specific and opposite mechanisms depending upon whether it concerns cell activation or inhibition .
Activation of platelets by different physiological stimuli induces transduction signalling processes resulting in an increase in cytosolic Ca** concentration .
This occurs by two phenomena : Ca* influx from extracellular medium through calcium channels and release of Ca** ions from intracellular Ca** storage pools including an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ( InsP , ) -sensitive Ca** pool and/or an InsP , -insensitive Ca** pool [ 1-4 ] .
Conversely , the restoration of platelet cytosolic Ca** concentration associated with the inhibition of platelet function , i.e .
the return to a basal state , is partly mediated by the activation of a multi-SERCA ( SarcoEndoplasmic Reticulum Ca**-ATPase ) system which decreases cytosolic Ca** concentration , by pumping Ca® ions into the intracellular Ca** pools .
One of these Ca**-ATPases was identified as the ubiquitous SERCA 2-b isoform [ 5 ] , a second one was recently shown to correspond to the SERCA 3 isoform [ 6,7 ] , whereas a third one was recently detected , specifically recognized by a platelet monoclonal antibody termed PL /IM 430 , but which still remains to be identified [ 8 ] .
In addition to their own activation in the regulation of platelet cytosolic Ca®* concentration , the Ca®*-ATPases were suggested to be up-regulated through cyclic AMP .
This hypothesis was initially based on the observation that cyclic AMP inhibits platelet function [ 1 ] in association with a decrease in Ca** concentration .
This might be a consequence of multiple sites [ 9,10 ] , as well as an action on the phospholipase C and/or the InsP , receptor , a stimulation of Ca** efflux , or an activation of Ca**-ATPases , the latter being the subject of the present study .
Indeed , an interesting early finding was that the addition of cyclic AMP to a cytosolic fraction containing cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase stimulated Ca** transport mediated by Ca**-ATPases and phosphorylated a 22 kDa protein [ 11 ] .
Various authors subsequently confirmed this finding , using different approaches .
First , Fox et al .
treated intact platelets with agents enhancing the cyclic AMP level and decreasing the cytosolic Ca** concentration .
They demonstrated that a 22 kDa membrane protein was phosphorylated concomitantly with an increase in Ca** uptake [ 12 ] .
Second , this effect of cyclic AMP on both the phosphorylation of a 22 kDa protein and Ca®** uptake was further confirmed by treating isolated membrane vesicles with the purified catalytic subunit ( C .
Sub . )
of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase [ 13,14 ] .
Many years later , the cyclic AMP-phosphoprotein was identified as a small GTP-binding protein of the Ras family , a Rapl protein , more precisely the Rap1B [ 15-17 ] .
Moreover , we were recently able to suggest that the Ca**-ATPase target of the regulation through the Rap1lB protein would strictly involve the 97 kDa isoform recognized by the PL/IM 430 antibody , among the above-defined platelet multi-SERCA system [ 18 ] .
However , during these studies , some controversy was raised about this effect of Rapl protein on platelet Ca** transport , based on the fact that the C. Sub .
effect could be Abbreviations used : C .
Sub. , catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase ; Rap , Ras-proximate ; SERCA , sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca®*-ATPase ; InsP , inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ; PL/IM 430 , monoclonal anti- ( Ca**-ATPase ) antibody raised using highly purified platelet intracellular membranes as immunogen .

470 C. Magnier and others artefactual and due rather to phosphate contamination of the commercial C. Sub .
solution than to the concomitant C. Sub.-induced phosphorylation of a 22 kDa protein by itself [ 19,20 ] .
Finally , this relationship between intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca** uptake was investigated by using a kinetic study in situ , ie .
again in intact platelets , which shows an increase in the rate and maximal extent of Ca** uptake [ 21 ] .
The aim of the present work was to revisit this relationship between the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein and the regulation of platelet Ca** transport by using an approach distinct from those previously used and taking advantage of the congestive heart failure model .
Indeed , because of the evidence for a down-regulation of myocardial # -adrenoreceptors in this pathology [ 22 ] , as well as altered platelet « 2-adrenoreceptors in patients with angina pectoris [ 23 ] , the regulation of cyclic AMP-phosphoproteins such as the major Rap1B protein in platelets could be modified in heart failure .
For this purpose , we looked for both Rapl protein expression and phosphorylation in mixed platelet membranes isolated from several patients with heart failure .
Because of the detection of variable abnormalities of the Rapl protein without significant modification of the PL/IM 430-recognizable 97 kDa Ca*-ATPase expression , we were able to further investigate the relationship between the Rapl protein and the regulation of platelet Ca®* uptake using this pathological model .
By studying patients with variable decreases in Rapl protein expression , a correlation between its phosphorylation and its effect on Ca** transport was found , thus again strongly arguing for an effect of Rapl protein phosphorylation on platelet Ca®* transport .
EXPERIMENTAL Materials BSA , Hepes , ATP ( sodium salt ) , the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart and the anti- ( mouse IgG ) -horseradish peroxidase conjugate were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO , U.S.A. ) .

Reactions were initiated by the addition of [ y-**P ] ATP and stopped by adding an equal volume of solubilization buffer containing 50 mM Tris , pH 6.8 , 1 % SDS , 0.01 % ( v/v ) Bromophenol Blue and 25 % glycerol .
Membrane proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE as described above .
They were electrotransferred on to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 250 mA and 4°C and autoradiographed at - 80 °C using Kodak X-Omat AR films and intensifying screens .
Western blot procedure ( a ) The anti-Rapl polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against a peptide encompassing residues 121-137 of the Rapl proteins .

Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in TBS ( 10 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl ) containing 5 % ( w/v ) non-fat dry milk , at 37°C for 1 h and then incubated with a 1 : 100 dilution of anti-Rapl serum in TBS containing 0.5 % nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature .
After this step , the nitrocellulose membranes were washed five times with distilled water and then with TBS and 0.1 % Tween 20 for 10 min .

'* '' I-labelled Protein A ( 30000 c.p.m./strip ) in TBS and 0.5 % non-fat dry milk .
The membranes were then washed twice in TBS and 0.1 % Tween 20 .
Autoradiography of the dried nitrocellulose membranes was performed at -80 °C using Kodak X-Omat AR films and intensifying screens .
( b ) The monoclonal PL/IM 430 antibody was raised using highly purified platelet intracellular membrane vesicles as immunogen , and purified from culture supernatant of the corresponding hybridoma cell line by Protein A affinity chromato-graphy at high ionic strength ( 3 M NaCl ) [ 8 ] .
Its preparation and characterization are described elsewhere [ 31 ] .
Briefly , this antibody inhibits Ca** uptake into platelet membrane vesicles and Rap1 protein and Ca # +* fluxes in platelets 471 Ca®* sequestration into intracellular stores in saponin-per-meabilized platelets , and specifically recognizes the 97 kDa Ca**-ATPase in platelets and different cell lines ( 32 ] .
Nitrocellulose membranes were treated overnight at room temperature with a quenching solution containing 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 0.1 % Tween 20 and 5 % non-fat dry milk .
The blots were then rinsed with the same solution and incubated with the purified PL/IM 430 antibody at a final concentration of 1 ug/ml for 2 h at room temperature .
There-after , the nitrocellulose sheets were extensively washed with the quenching solution and further incubated with the anti- ( mouse IgG ) -horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( 1 : 2000 dilution ) for 2 h. After washing steps , antibody binding was detected by using the ECL Western blotting reagents according to the instructions of the manufacturer .
Measurement of Ca*+ uptake into platelet membrane vesicles Calcium uptake by the membrane vesicles was measured by incubating 100 ug of platelet membranes in 1 ml of reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes buffer , pH 7.4 , 100 mM KCI , 5 or 10 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mM *CaCl , and 0.5 mM EGTA .
The final concentration of free Ca** was 1.6 M as calculated according to Fabiato and Fabiato [ 33 ] .
The reaction was started by adding 5 mM ATP to the incubation medium and stirring at 37 °C .
At various intervals , 0.1 ml aliquots were withdrawn and filtered through Millipore filters ( HAWP 0.45-um pore size ) previously soaked in a 2 mg/ml BSA solution .
The filters were washed three times with 5 ml of 0.1 M CaCl , and counted for radioactivity in 10 ml of scintillation liquid .
RESULTS Relationship between platelet Ca** transport and Rap1 protein phosphorylation Effect of C. Sub .

Because one argument for an effect of phosphate ions present in the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase ( C .
Sub . )
over that of concomitant C. Sub.-induced protein phosphorylation on Ca** uptake was based on the fact that dialysed C. Sub .
was inactive ( whereas it fully phosphorylated a 22 kDa protein [ 20 ] ) , we proceeded with dialysis of the C. Sub .
preparation .
Then , we tested its effect on isolated platelet membranes for specific Rapl protein phosphorylation as previously characterized [ 16,18 ] ( Figure 1a ) and Ca®* uptake under conditions again previously used and characterized as allowing total Ca®* uptake mediated by the multi-SERCA system { 24,25,34,35 ] ( Figure 1b ) .
Figure 1 ( a ) shows that we did not succeed in maintaining a full C. Sub .
activity to phosphorylate the Rapl protein .
Indeed , the comparison between lanes 2 and 3 obviously shows significant reduction in phosphorylation of the Rapl protein after dialysis .
In agreement with this finding was the result of Figure 1 ( b ) showing the absence of any significant effect of dialysed C. Sub .
on total Ca** uptake , whereas non-dialysed C. Sub .
induced the twofold stimulation previously observed .
So , these findings mean that , in our hands , the dissociation between the effect of C. Sub .
and that of phosphate on Ca** uptake can not be obtained using dialysed C. Sub .
Consequently , we were led to develop the following approaches .

The priming effect of C. Sub .
To begin with , we tried to dissociate the effect of C. Sub .
from that of phosphate ions and focused on the Ca** uptake mediated by the PL/IM 430-recognizable SERCA target of the Rapl protein .
For this purpose , we took advantage of the following previous observations about the platelet Ca®**-ATPase system : ( i ) the PL /IM 430-recognizable 97 kDa Ca**-ATPase accounts for a large part of Ca®** uptake among the multi-SERCA [ 36 ] and 4172 C.

requires higher ATP concentrations than the SERCA 2-b and SERCA 3 isoforms [ 8 ] ; ( ii ) Mg**-ATPase activities are present in mixed membrane fractions which can mask the SERCA activities [ 34 ] .
So , we postulated that this masking of Ca** uptake by increasing MgCl , should be particularly effective as regards the PL /IM 430-recognizable 97 kDa Ca**-ATPase .
In such a case , it should be possible to look for some priming role of the Rapl protein phosphorylation to induce Ca®* uptake , thus allowing the subsequent effect of phosphate ions on the Ca** transport , ie .
dissociating the two effects in a sequential manner .
Thus , we isolated mixed platelet membrane fractions and tested the effect of C. Sub .
on Ca** uptake under the experimental conditions of Figure 1 ( b ) , except for MgCl , concentration , which was increased by a factor of two .
Figure 2 shows the results of these experiments conducted on platelet membrane vesicles isolated from normal individuals .
Whereas the Ca** uptake was very low under these conditions , as expected , the time course of the effect of C. Sub .
was strikingly different .
( i ) It appeared to be delayed in comparison with our previous findings ( Figure 1b ) , i.e .
not observed in the first minutes .
In contrast , and very interestingly , the stimulation of Ca®* uptake began to be visualizable clearly after 10 min in-cubation , the corresponding time for a maximal effect of C. Sub .
on the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein [ 35-37 ] .
( ii ) It was much more pronounced , as it increased by a factor of about 8 , reaching a Ca®* uptake of 80 nmol/mg of protein at 30 min , in agreement with the specific unmasking of the effect of C. Sub .
on its target Ca® '' *-ATPase .
So , the most likely interpretation for these results is that the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein induced by C. Sub .
appears as a condition for platelet Ca** transport and occurs prior to the effect of phosphate ions , thus constituting new experimental conditions under which to study the relationship between Rapl protein phosphorylation and the regulation of Ca** transport .

Comparative expression of the platelet 97 kDa and Rap1 protein phosphorylation in heart failure In parallel , we looked for a pathological model in which to investigate the role of the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein on the PL /IM 430-recognizable 97 kDa Ca**-ATPase , and tested the usefulness of the congestive heart failure model .
Thus , we screened a series of three patients with severe heart failure ( patients 1 , 2 and 3 ) for their expression of the 97 kDa Ca*-ATPase and their exogenous phosphorylation of the Rapl protein .
For this purpose , we isolated mixed platelet membranes ( 100000 g fraction ) [ 8,16 ] and performed , in parallel , Western blotting experiments using the PL /IM 430 purified monoclonal antibody and Rapl protein phosphorylation using C .
Sub. , both technical approaches being well documented [ 8,16,18,28,38 ] .
Figure 3 shows the comparative results of such experiments performed on three patients ( lanes 1 to 3 ) and one normal individual ( lane C ) .
Figure 3 ( a ) shows the results of the Western blottings of the 97 kDa Ca®**-ATPase , whereas Figure 3 ( b ) shows the Rapl protein phosphorylation obtained in the presence ( lanes + ) or in the absence ( lanes - ) of 15 ug/ml C. Sub .
We can see that the expression of the 97 kDa Ca®**-ATPase protein ( Figure 3a ) was present in the platelet membranes isolated from a normal individual and the patients , in spite of some possible variations between individuals .
Figure 3 ( b ) shows that the specific Rapi protein phosphorylation in the platelet membranes isolated from the same patients differed because , when compared with the normal individual , it appeared similar in patient 3 , but higher in patient 2 and lower in patient 1 .
Moreover , while the Rapl protein phosphorylation in patients 2 and 3 could also refer to Rapt protein and Ca # +* fluxes in platelets 473 some variations between individuals , the striking decrease in Rapl phosphorylation found in patient 1 clearly by-passed this variation .
So , this first examination seemed encouraging to us , as it provided an opportunity of testing a cell system showing a modulation of the phosphorylation of the Rapl protein .
Correlation between Rap1 protein expression , phosphorylation and stimulation of Ca*+ transport in platelets from a patient with severe heart failure These data prompted us to immediately test the effect of C. Sub .
on the Ca®* transport system described in Figure 2 in platelet membrane vesicles isolated from one patient ( patient 4 ) with severe dilated cardiomyopathy , and we studied in parallel these platelets for Rapl protein phosphorylation and the effect of C. Sub .
on Ca** uptake .
In addition , because the apparent decrease in exogenous phosphorylation of the Rapl1 platelet protein could be due either to a variation in the endogenous phosphorylation or to a decrease in the Rapl protein expression , we also used platelets from this patient to study comparatively Rapl protein expression and phosphorylation in order to discriminate between the two alternatives .
( a ) Comparative Rap1 protein phosphorylation and expression Mixed 100000 g platelet membranes were isolated and treated either for Rapl protein phosphorylation as in Figure 3 ( b ) or for Rapl protein expression by Western blotting using a previously well-characterized anti-Rapl antibody , clearly shown to recognize specifically platelet Rapl protein by both Western blotting and immunoprecipitation [ 16,38 ] .
The results of these experiments are presented in Figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b ) respectively .
Clearly , a strong decrease in Rapl protein phosphorylation ( which appears here as a doublet band due to incomplete reduction ) was observed in the platelet membranes isolated from this patient ( lane 4+ ) as compared with that of the platelet membranes of the normal individual ( lane C+ ) .
However , the Rapl protein phosphorylation was not null , because some residual Rapl protein phosphorylation was visible on this Figure ( for which we deliberately used longer autoradiographic exposure times than those used in Figure 3 ) .
The further examination of the Rapl protein expression in the platelets from the same patient ( Figure 4b ) established that this decrease appeared well correlated with its phosphorylation , as it drastically decreased ( compare lane 4 to lane C ) .
So , the most plausible explanation for the decrease in Rapl protein phosphorylation is that it referred to a lower Rapl protein expression .
Finally , the analysis of the 97 kDa Ca®*-ATPase expression in the same patient again showed no marked difference compared with the platelets from the normal individual ( results not shown ) .
( b ) Comparative effect of C. Sub .
on Ca '' * uptake into membrane vesicles The results , presented in Figure 4 ( c ) , show the comparative time courses of Ca** uptake into the membrane vesicles isolated from platelets of the same normal individual and patient 4 , in the presence or absence of 15 ug/ml C. Sub .
It is clear that whereas similar low Ca®* uptake was visualizable in the absence of C .
Sub. , the effect of C. Sub .
was greatly decreased in membrane vesicles isolated from platelets of this patient .

This Figure is typical of two experiments .

Sub. , which only became detectable at 20 min and remained considerably decreased .
So again , phosphate ions , present in similar amounts in the different samples , obviously are not the sole factor responsible for stimulation of Ca** uptake .

Membrane proteins ( 50 ag ) were separated on SDS/15 % -PAGE , electroblotted , and treated for Western blotting and immunodetection as in Figure 4 ( b ) .
The intensities of immunoreactive bands were estimated by densitometric measurements using a laser densitometer .
For each experiment , the control values obtained for Rapi protein expression in normal platelets were arbitrarily taken as 100 % .
The results ( bars 5 to 7 ) are expressed as percentages of Rap1 protein expression versus the control ( bar C ) .

Correlation between the Rap1 protein levels and the stimulation of Ca®+ uptake in a further series of patients with heart failure Finally , we studied another series of three different patients with characterized heart failure , and tested in parallel their platelet membranes for Rapl protein expression and the effect of C. Sub .
on Ca** uptake , for which we used the experimental conditions of Figure 4 ( b ) and Figure 2 respectively .
Moreover , the expressions of Rapl proteins were estimated by densitometric measurements of the radioactive bands from the same immuno-blots and were expressed as percentages of Rapl protein expression compared with that of the normal individual .
The results of the effect of 15 ug/ml of C. Sub .
on the Ca®* uptake by platelet membrane vesicles from the same patients were expressed as percentages of the stimulation observed at 30 min .
Figure 5 shows the results of these studies conducted on the same day .
Clearly , the analysis of these data allows the conclusion that this last study : ( i ) confirmed the results presented in Figure 3 obtained using a first series of patients , because the platelet Rapl protein expressions can be decreased in patients with heart failure , and that this decrease varied greatly , in that it did not exceed 20 % in patient 5 ( lane 5 ) but reached about 60 % in patient 7 ( lane 7 ) ; ( ii ) demonstrated the direct relationship between these variable expressions of Rapl protein and the stimulatory effect of C. Sub .
on Ca®** uptake .
Thus , this so far undescribed opportunity of testing pathological platelets which express abnormal and variable Rapl protein levels constitutes a further argument for the close relationship between the phosphorylation of this protein and the regulatory effect on platelet Ca** transport .
DISCUSSION This paper first describes an abnormality in the Rapl protein expression and phosphorylation in platelets from patients with heart failure , and secondly establishes a correlation between this abnormality and the stimulatory effect of C. Sub .
on Ca** uptake by membrane vesicles .
Thus , the first essential feature of this work is that it suggested a new way to investigate the relationship between the phosphorylation of the platelet Rapl protein and stimulation of Ca* uptake by intracellular Ca**-ATPases .
Indeed , as explained in the Introduction , a controversy was raised , based on an artefactual effect of C .
Sub. , although these findings did not take into account similar results of the effect of cyclic AMP on stimulation of the Ca®* transport process , examined by approaches on intact platelets which did not involve the C. Sub .
[ 11,12,21 ] .
Also , it did not consider the fact that there is increasing evidence that all the different mechanisms involved in the regulation of cytosolic Ca** concentration , such as Ca** channels [ 39 ] , plasma membrane-type Ca**-ATPase [ 40 ] , the intracellular SERCA 1 isoform of Ca**-ATPase [ 41 ] , and the InsP , -induced Ca®** release [ 42 ] , are regulated by cyclic AMP in different cell types .
Here , we studied a cell system with variable expression of the Rapl protein and phosphorylation and showed a correlation between a down-regulation of Rap1 protein and a decrease in the effect of cyclic AMP to regulate Ca®** uptake .
Moreover , and interestingly , these findings are just complementary to our recent study of another platelet pathology , where we found an increase in Ca®* uptake associated with an increase in endogenous Rap !
protein phosphorylation , in studies conducted without using C .
Sub. , i.e .
where contaminating phosphate was absent [ 38 ] .
So , our present interpretation of the controversy is as follows : the question of whether studies using C. Sub .
in phosphate buffer measured phosphate- and/or C. Sub.-induced phosphorylation effectively could raise the problem of the difficulty of dissociating the two effects .
However , first , one approach used to solve this question was to proceed with the dialysis of C .
Sub. , but we failed to maintain full phosphorylation after this step ( Figure la ) .
Secondly , a consensus does exist between authors to show that platelet Rapl1 protein is phosphorylated by the C. Sub .
Thirdly , the unmasking of the effect of C. Sub .
depends upon the experimental conditions ( not detectable or transient in Ca** uptake studies without Ca®*-EGTA buffers ) and it appears here as a condition for Ca** uptake , such as the effect of the phosphorylation of the phospholamban in the cardiac SERCA 2 isoform , because in its dephosphorylated form phospholamban inhibits Ca®** uptake , but it allows Ca®* uptake in its phosphorylated form [ 43 ] .
As a consequence , we conclude that the present study largely confirms the relationship between the phosphorylation of Rapl platelet protein and the stimulation of Ca** transport .
However , this new evidence for a relationship between the phosphorylation of the platelet Rapl protein and the stimulation of Ca®* transport could raise the question of the location of the proteins involved .
Indeed , as regards the platelet Rapl protein , literature data , including our investigation after cell fraction-ation , establish its association with plasma membranes [ 15 17,44,45 ] .
In apparent contrast , the 97 kDa platelet Ca**-ATPase , which is recognized by PL/IM 430 , reacts with a monoclonal antibody raised against intracellular platelet membranes ; so , the question of a plasma membrane association is raised .
Never-theless , the technique used to obtain these membranes involved Rap1 protein and fluxes in platelets 475 neuraminidase treatment which can result in some platelet activation , i.e .
a redistribution of organelles , such as the migration of Ca** pools located next to the plasma membrane facing the intracellular space .
In agreement with this hypothesis , the results of preliminary experiments suggest a translocation of the PL /IM 430-recognizable 97 kDa Ca**-ATPase from plasma membranes towards intracellular membranes upon platelet activation ( G. Berger , T. Kovacs , E. Corvazier , J. Enouf and E. Martin-Cramer , unpublished work ) .
As a consequence , even if a co-location still remains to be established , the available data can not eliminate the relationship between the platelet Rapl protein and PL/IM 430-recognizable Ca®*-ATPase , based on different locations of the proteins .
Finally , the other essential feature of this work concerns the evidence for abnormal platelet Rapl protein expression in congestive heart failure .
Rapl proteins were recently described in different cell types [ 46 ] , and the study of their roles is still under investigation .
In particular , we know very little about the regulation of their expression in cell functions , especially in haematopoietic cells such as platelets which , intriguingly , over-express this type of protein .
The present finding of the down-regulation of Rapl expression , well established here by both Western blotting using a specific anti-peptide antibody and its phosphorylation , is particularly interesting because it constitutes , as far as we know , the first example of down-regulation of the expression of the platelet Rapl protein .
Indeed , our previous investigations in this context led us to observe up-regulation of Rapl1 protein in the two different pathological models studied , associated with an increase in cytosolic Ca** concentration , namely in platelets from hypertensive rats [ 18 ] and on proliferation of smooth-muscle cells induced by a growth factor , the platelet-derived growth factor [ 30 ] .
So , interestingly , Rapl proteins appear to be up-regulated in pathological situations associated with an increase in cytosolic Ca®* , but in heart failure this type of protein appears to be down-regulated , as are cardiac f-adrenergic receptors which lead to a decrease in cyclic AMP concentration .
Thus the present study still emphasizes the interrelation between the two messengers constituted by Ca** ions and cyclic AMP .
