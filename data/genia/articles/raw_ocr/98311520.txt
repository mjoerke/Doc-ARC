Clin Exp Immunol 1998 ; 112:242-247 Oxidative stress suppresses transcription factor activities in stimulated lymphocytes E. FLESCHER , H. TRIPOLI , K. SALNIKOW & F. J. BURNS Department of Environmental Medicine , New York University Medical Center , Tuxedo , NY , USA ( Accepted for publication 9 December 1997 ) SUMMARY Effects of oxidative stress on stimulation-dependent signal transduction , leading to IL-2 expression , were studied .
Purified quiescent human blood T lymphocytes were subjected to : ( 1 ) acute exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; ( ii ) chronic exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; and ( iii ) acute exposure to ionizing radiation .
The cells were then stimulated for 6h .
DNA-binding activities ( determined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) of three transcription factors : NFkB , AP-1 and NFAT , were abolished in the lymphocytes by all three modes of oxidative stress .
The lymphocytes exhibited lipid peroxidation only upon exposure to the lowest level of hydrogen peroxide used ( 20 um ) .
All three modes of oxidative stress induced catalase activity in the lymphocytes .
The only exception was hydrogen peroxide at 20 um , which did not induce catalase activity .
We conclude that : ( 1 ) suppression of specific transcription factor functions can potentially serve as a marker of exposure to oxidative stress and its effects on human lymphocytes ; ( ii ) lipid peroxidation is only detectable in human lymphocytes upon exposure to weak oxidative stress which does not induce catalase activity ; ( iii ) therefore , transcription factor DNA binding activities are more sensitive to oxidative stress than lipid peroxidation .
Keywords - oxidative stress INTRODUCTION T lymphocytes are activated following the binding of a ligand to the antigen receptor complex .
One of the early manifestations of this interaction is the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene [ 1 ] .
IL-2 is a pivotal lymphokine involved in B and T lymphocyte , as well as natural killer ( NK ) cell regulation [ 1 ] .
The modulation of IL-2 transcription by nuclear proteins can serve as a general readout that would be affected by any abnormality occurring earlier in the activation pathway .
A transcriptional enhancer in the promoter region of the IL-2 gene responds to signals generated after activation through the T cell antigen receptor [ 2 ] .
A number of positive regulatory elements have been identified in this region , including : NFAT , AP-1 , NF « B , EGR-1 , AP-3 , Oct-1 , and Spl [ 3-5 ] .
Transcription factors binding to the first three , which are expressed in primary human T cells only upon stimulation , are plausible targets for suppression of T cell activation .
A variety of distinct biochemical changes in lymphocytes and in various other target cells is induced by the oxidants hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical .
These changes include alterations in enzymatic activities , lipid peroxidation and damage to DNA .

The absorption of radiation involves splitting H , O molecules ( the most common constituent of cells ) into hydroxyl radicals and H® radicals which are initially distributed in proportion to the radiation dose distribution [ 6 ] .
In addition , irradiation of dissolved O ; , will produce the superoxide radical , HO ; , ® , also following the radiation dose distribution .
The superoxide radical has intermediate reactivity between that of strongly reactive hydroxyl radicals and relatively weakly reactive hydrogen peroxide .
We have previously described a new mechanism of IL-2 down-regulation [ 7 ] .
Endogenous hydrogen peroxide produced by monocytes and endogenously produced or exogenously added polyamines provide down-regulatory signals for IL-2 production by human peripheral blood T cells .
The interaction between polyamine oxidase ( PAO ; EC 1.4.3.4 , monoamine oxidase ) and the polyamine spermidine generates products ( including hydrogen peroxide ) over 2days that provide chronic low-level oxidative stress , suppressing IL-2 production .
Furthermore , we found that PAO activity suppressed protein tyrosine phosphorylation , calcium mobilization and nuclear DNA-binding activities [ 8 ] .
The objective of this study was to compare the effects of three modes of inducing oxidative stress in human lymphocytes on stimulation-induced transcription factors , in order to facilitate the development of functional markers for the exposure to , and effect of , oxidative stress in man .
Oxidative stress was exerted on unstimulated © 1998 Blackwell Science Oxidative stress and transcription factors 243 cells , since the vast majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) are in a quiescent state .
The modes studied were : ( i ) high levels of reagent hydrogen peroxide generating short but acute stress ; ( ii ) PAO activity generating extracellularly low levels of hydrogen peroxide for 2 days ; and ( iii ) electron irradiation generating both extra- and intracellularly mainly hydroxyl radicals .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors were studied .
Cells were incubated for all assays in a serum-free medium , because fetal calf serum ( FCS ) contains PAO activity [ 7 ] .
Therefore , RPMI1640 with Nutridoma-HU supplement ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals , Indianapolis , IN ) was used .
Lymphocyte preparation .
Cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypa-que ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Uppsala , Sweden ) density gradient centrifugation .
The resultant mononuclear cell preparation was allowed to adhere to plastic dishes to remove macrophages and other adherent cells .
Non-adherent mononuclear cells were mixed with a suspension of neuroaminidase-treated sheep erythrocytes and incubated at 37°C for 15 min , followed by centrifugation and further incubation at 4°C for 45 min .
Thereafter , the rosetted cells were obtained by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque .
The erythrocytes in the cell pellet were lysed by exposure to 0-83 % NH , Cl .
The rosetted cells contained > 98 % CD3 * T cells , and 0-4-1 % M3~ monocytes as determined by flow cytometry .
Oxidative stress These modes were used : ( i ) a short high-level extracellular stress-reagent hydrogen peroxide was added directly at 20 , 50,100 and 200 um for 2h .
We have found that these levels suppress IL-2 production in human blood lymphocytes without affecting cell viability [ 9 ] ; ( ii ) a longitudinal low level extracellular stress-lymphocytes were preincubated for 2 days with a commercial preparation of PAO ( a monoamine oxidase which oxidizes polyamines at a 2-5-fold higher rate than benzylamine [ 7 ] ; Sigma , St Louis , MO ) at 5x10 * U/ml and spermidine at 5 um .
This exposure generates gradually 5 um hydrogen peroxide over 2days and suppresses IL-2 production in response to mitogenic stimulation [ 7 ] ; ( iii ) electron radiation generating both extra- and intracellularly mainly hydroxyl radicals-lym-phocytes were exposed to a radiation dose of 6 Gy for 5 min .
This dose produces non-lethal cellular responses [ 10 ] and generates oxidants per time unit at about 20-fold higher levels than mode ( ii ) , but for a much shorter period of time .
We used a 2-5-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator that generated electrons to a maximum energy of 1-8 MeV .
The cells were exposed in suspension to high energy x-rays generated by stopping the electron beam in a tantalum plate .
Doses were continuously monitored by means of parallel plate ionization chambers coupled with a stable , vibrating reed electrometer .
Oxidative stress was exerted and the cells were washed and rested for 2h before stimulation in order to exclude any possible effects on the assay used .
Measurements of transcription factor activities For T cell stimulation we used phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ; 1 ug/ ml ) + tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( TPA ; 5 ng/ml ) , for 6h at 37°C , 5 % CO ; , before collecting the cells for nuclear extraction .
DNA-binding determination by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Cells were washed and nuclear extracts were prepared according to a modification of the method of Schreiber etal .
[ 11 ] .
This method is suitable for small numbers of cells and therefore appropriate ( based on our experi-ence ; [ 8,12 ] ) for studies of PBL .
Cells were washed and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline , transferred to an Eppendorf tube and repelleted .
The cell pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 10mm HEPES , 10mm KCl , 0-1 mm EDTA , 0-1 my EGTA , 1mm DTT , 1mm PMSF , 5 pg/ml aprotinin , 5 pg/ml antipain , 100 um benzamidine , 5 ug/ml leupeptin , 5 ug/ml pepstatin , 5 ug/ ml soybean trypsin chymotrypsin inhibitor , pH 7-9 .
The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min and NP-40 at 0-625 % was added .
The tube was vortexed for 10s and centrifuged for 30s in a microfuge .
The nuclear pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES , 0-41 NaCl , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm EGTA , 1 mm DTT , and the seven aforementioned protease inhibitors , pH 7-9 .
The tube was vigorously rocked on wet ice for 15 min on a shaking platform , and the nuclear extract was centrifuged for 5min to remove insoluble nuclear matrix .
The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined ( Bradford method ; BioRad Protein Assay Kit ( Hercules , CA ) ) .
Aliquots were stored at -70°C .
DNA-protein interactions .
DNA probes containing the binding sites from the IL-2 promoter region [ 3 ] were purchased from Genosys ( The Woodlands , TX ) .
The probe for NFAT-1 spans between nucleotides -255 and -285 : 5-GGAGGAAAAACTGTTT-CATACAGAAGGCGTT-3 ' .
The probe for AP-1 spans between nucleotides -140 and -156 : 5-TTCAAAGAGTCATCAG-3 ' .
The probe for NFkB spans between nucleotides -190 and -214 : 5'-TAACAAACAGGGATTTCACCTACAT-3 .
The probes were labelled with °°P-ATP using T4 polynucleo-tide kinase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
For the binding assay , 10 000 ct/min DNA probe ( ~0-2 ng ) were combined with 2 ug poly ( dI-dC ) ( a non-specific competitor DNA ) , 3 ug bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; a protein carrier ) and 10 ug nuclear extract in a final reaction volume of 20 pl .
The binding reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min in a 30°C water bath .
The protein-DNA complexes were detected on a 4 % low ionic strength native polyacrylamide gel .
The gel was dried under vacuum and autoradiographed .
Measurements of lipid peroxidation Quantitative peroxide assay .
A lipid-compatible formulation of the PeroXOquant Quantitative Peroxide Assay ( Pierce Chemical Co. , Rockford , IL ) was used .
This assay is adapted to measure cellular hydroperoxides .
To differentiate between hydrogen peroxide and peroxides of cellular molecules ( such as lipid peroxides ) we followed the recommendations of the manufacturer and regarded any catalase ( 7000 U/ml ) -inhibitable measurement as representing hydrogen peroxide .
In the assay , peroxides convert Fe** to Fe * in a sulphuric acid solution .
The Fe® * complexes with the xylenol orange dye to yield a purple product with absorbance at 540-600nm .
The molar extinction coefficient of the xylenol orange—Fe3+ complex is 1-5x10'*m 'em in 25 mm HSQ4 at room temperature .
Five million cells were lysed by sonication ( two 10-s pulses with a 10-s interval ) and incubated for 15-20 min at room temperature in the following working solution ( 10 times the volume of the sonicate ) : 0-25 mm ammonium ferrous ( II ) sulphate , 25mm H , SO , , 4mm butylated hydroxytoluene ( BHT ) , 125 um xylenol orange in methanol .
Results were read at 595 nm in a microtitre plate reader .

IL-2 is central to the cellular immune response , and inability to express this gene would result in cellular dysfunction of T lymphocytes .
Three DNA-binding activities present in activated lymphocytes were studied : NFxB , AP-1 and NFAT .
The cells were subjected to oxidative stress : an enzymatic activity ( PAQ ) generating hydrogen peroxide , irradiation and four concentrations of hydrogen peroxide administered directly to the cells .
None of these stresses affected lymphocyte viability , which remained at 95 % , as determined by trypan blue exclusion .
Figure 1 demonstrates the effect of oxidative stress on NFkB DNA-binding in T lymphocytes .
While unstimulated cells ( Unst . )
did not express NFkB DNA binding , stimulated cells ( Stim . )
did express this activity , and the interaction was specific , as shown by its prevention in the presence of a specific competitor ( an excess of unlabeled NFkB DNA , Stim .

All the types and levels of oxidative stress we employed completely abolished the induction of NFkB DNA-binding in stimulated T lymphocytes .
As can be seen in Figs 2 and 3 , protein binding activities to two other DNA sequences ( AP-1 and NFAT ) were only expressed in stimulated T cells and were abolished by exposing the cells to oxidative stress , similar to the results obtained with the NFkB sequence .

biochemical parameter of exposure to oxidants .
The basal level of lipid peroxides in T lymphocytes was 24 + 0-7 nmol lipid hydroperoxides/mg protein .
Only treatment with hydrogen peroxide at 20 um for 2h induced a rise in cellular peroxides to 119+ lipid hydroperoxide/mg protein ( P < 0-0005 ) , while the other treatments ( hydrogen peroxide at 50-200 pum , polyamine oxidase and irradiation ) did not induce any rise in the levels of lipid peroxides above basal levels .
A possible explanation of these findings is that the direct biochemical damage was repaired within 2h after the exposures .
The lowest concentration of hydrogen peroxide may not have been sufficient to induce appropriate levels of antioxidant defences , allowing the lipid peroxidation to be detected .
To investigate this possibility , levels of the major antioxidative enzyme , catalase , were measured in T lymphocytes exposed to oxidative stress .
Catalase determination in lymphocytes exposed to oxidative stress Every oxidative stress exposure , except for hydrogen peroxide at 20 um , induced a significant rise in cellular catalase activity above the basal level ( Fig .

DISCUSSION Three modes of oxidative stress-hydrogen peroxide , polyamine oxidase activity generating hydrogen peroxide gradually , and itra-diation-suppressed the activation-dependent DNA-binding activities of three transcription factors , NF « B , AP-1 and NFAT , in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes .
Only exposure to hydrogen peroxide at 20 um generated measurable lipid peroxidation products in T lymphocytes , while this was the only exposure that did not induce an increase in cellular catalase activity .
We have previously reported [ 8 ] that exposure to polyamine oxidase results in suppression of transmembrane signal transduction in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes .
This leads to © 1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Clinical and Experimental Immunology , 112:242-247 246 E. Flescher et al .
suppression of the activation-dependent expression of transcription factors in the nucleus , and finally to inhibition of the transcription of the IL-2 gene .
In the current study , we compared the effects of different types and levels of oxidative stress on nuclear signal transduction in exposed human lymphocytes .
Three transcription factor DNA-binding activities were suppressed in T lymphocytes by every condition of oxidative stress employed .
The fact that we did not detect a dose-response dependence in the suppression of transcription factor activity by hydrogen peroxide suggests that suppressing early signalling events by oxidative stress [ 8 ] results in an all-or-none effect on distal signalling steps in the nucleus .
The DNA-binding activities of NFB and AP-1 are induced upon exposure to oxidants [ 16-18 ] .
The apparent contradiction with our results may be resolved by recognizing that in our system ( but not in the other studies mentioned ) cells were incubated for 2 h in fresh medium after the exposures , followed by stimulation for 6 h , and only then were DNA-binding activities determined .
Therefore , we are assessing the effects of oxidative stress on T cell mitogenic activation rather than the direct effect on transcription factor activities .
We have previously found that oxidative stress suppresses early signal transduction steps , protein tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization [ 8 ] .
Therefore , the eventual suppression of transcription factor activities may actually reflect early effects of oxidative stress on lymphocyte transmembrane signal transduction .
In this context , the decline in IL-2 production by human T lymphocytes from aged persons in response to in vitro stimulation is associated with impaired activation of AP-1 and NFAT [ 19 ] .
In view of the oxygen radical-related theory of ageing , this is potentially an example of T cell suppression at the signal transduction level by oxidative stress in vivo .
We found that radiation suppressed the expression of DNA-binding activities in activated T lymphocytes .
Radiation of human lymphocytes in vitro was previously found to suppress constitutive surface marker expression [ 20 ] and enhance micronuclei occurrence following stimulation [ 21 ] .
Since NFkB and AP-1 were recently found to be the most important IL-2 cis-regulatory elements in normal T cells [ 22 ] , and we have shown that the acute and chronic modes of oxidative stress used in this study suppress IL-2 production by human lymphocytes [ 7,9 ] , our results strongly suggest that suppression of transcription factor function caused by inducing oxidative stress in human lymphocytes contributes to down-regulation of IL-2 production and cellular activation .
IL-2 is a major growth factor regulating T lymphocyte proliferation [ 23 ] .
Therefore , suppression of nuclear signalling events that control IL-2 expression reflects not only exposure but also the detrimental effect of exposure to oxidative stress inducers .
Direct measurements of lipid hydroperoxides did not detect increased levels following oxidative stress , except for exposure of T lymphocytes to the lowest concentration of hydrogen peroxide .
The same hydrogen peroxide concentration ( 20 um ) was the only one from among the oxidative stress exposures employed in the current study that did not induce a rise in catalase activity .
Therefore , we suggest that when the oxidative stress induces an antioxidative response , i.e .
catalase activity , lipid peroxidation is not detectable .
PAO did not induce lipid peroxidation , although the enzymatic activity generates only 5 um H ; O ; , because the intensity of the cellular stress is determined not only by the concentration of the oxidant but also by the duration of the exposure ( in the case of PAO , 2 days ) .
Accordingly , PAO exposure induced an increase in cellular catalase activity .
On the other hand , all three modes of oxidative stress resulted in suppression of cellular function that was clearly evident even 8-26h after the exposures , as judged by transcription factor activities .
Our results suggest that a functional parameter ( nuclear signal transduction ) is much more sensitive than a structural parameter ( lipid peroxidation ) as a marker of oxidative damage to human blood lymphocytes .
These results suggest that transcription factor functions can potentially be used as markers of blood lymphocyte exposure to oxidants ( including hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals ) which generate either acute or chronic stresses .
Our studies were conducted with human PBL , which are readily available , and should therefore be amenable to development into population-based markers of environmental exposure to oxidants .
Ex vivo peripheral blood cells can also be used for follow up of exposed individuals .
