6 The Promoter of the CD19 Gene Is a Target for the B-Cell-Specific Transcription Factor BSAP ZBYNEK KOZMIK , SHIRLEY WANG , PETRA DORFLER , BEN ADAMS , '' anp MEINRAD BUSSLINGER* Institute of Molecular Pathology , Dr. Bohr-Gasse 7 , A-1030 Vienna , Austria Received 5 December 1991/Accepted 4 March 1992 The CD19 protein is expressed on the surface of all B-lymphoid cells with the exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells and has been implicated as a signal-transducing receptor in the control of proliferation and differentiation .
Here we demonstrate complete correlation between the expression pattern of the CD19 gene and the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP in a large panel of B-lymphoid cell lines .
The human CD19 gene has been cloned , and several BSAP-binding sites have been mapped by in vitro protein-DNA binding studies .
In particular , a high-affinity BSAP-binding site instead of a TATA sequence is located in the -30 promoter region upstream of a cluster of heterogeneous transcription start sites .
Moreover , this site is occupied by BSAP in vivo in a CD19-expressing B-cell line but not in plasma or HeLa cells .
This high-affinity site has been conserved in the promoters of both human and mouse CD19 genes and was furthermore shown to confer B-cell specificity to a B-globin reporter gene in transient transfection experiments .
In addition , BSAP was found to be the only abundant DNA-binding activity of B-cell nuclear extracts that interacts with the CD19 promoter .
Together , this evidence strongly implicates BSAP in the regulation of the CD19 gene .
The differentiation of B lymphocytes from progenitor cells to immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells is a multistep process which is characterized by the sequential expression of specific cell surface markers involved in cell-cell interaction and signal transduction ( 29 ) .
Among them is the B-cell-specific antigen CD19 .
This protein is expressed throughout B-cell ontogeny from the early progenitor cell up to the mature B-cell stage and is lost from the cell surface only at the terminal stages of B-cell differentiation .
The CD19 molecule is present on both normal and malignant B-lymphoid cells and hence is the most reliable diagnostic surface marker of the human B-cell lineage ( 23 , 35 ) .
The CD19 gene codes for a 95-kDa protein with two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains , a short transmembrane region , and a large cytoplasmic tail ( 33 , 34 , 38 ) .
These features suggest that the CD19 protein is a membrane receptor involved in signal transduction of B lymphocytes .
No natural ligand for CD19 is as yet known ; instead , monoclonal anti-CD19 antibodies have been used to study the physiological function of the CD19 molecule .
In agreement with the receptor hypothesis , antibody binding leads to rapid internalization of CD19 ( 7 , 35 ) and to mobilization of free intracellular calcium ions ( 17 , 27 , 35 ) .
CD19 antibodies strongly inhibit proliferation of resting mature B cells in response to stimulation with anti-immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibodies ( 11 , 27 , 35 ) .
They provide , however , a positive proliferative signal for early precursor B cells ( 17 ) , indicating that CD19 is involved in positive or negative control of proliferation , depending on the stage of B-cell differentiation .
Transmembrane signaling via the CD19 receptor is also important for late events of B-cell differentiation , as CD19 antibodies block in vitro differentiation of mature B cells to plasma cells ( 7 , 11 ) .
CD19 specifically associates with at least four other cell surface proteins to form a multimolecular complex which includes the B-cell-specific complement receptor type 2 ( CD21 ) in * Corresponding author .

2662 mature B cells ( 20 ) .
Activation of the CD19-CD21 complex has recently been shown to potentiate the primary response of B cells to antigen in vivo ( 14 ) .
Regulation of B-cell-specific gene expression is brought about by several distinct transcription factors ( reference 3 and references therein ) .
One of them is the B-cell lincage-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) .
We have identified this transcription factor as a mammalian homolog of the sea urchin protein TSAP , which is responsible for the developmental and tissue-specific regulation of two nonallelic pairs of late histone H2A-2 and H2B-2 genes ( 2 ) .
The four TSAP-binding sites present in these histone gene promoters are recognized by TSAP with equal affinity , and yet they differ considerably in primary sequence , allowing the definition of only a degenerate consensus sequence ( 2 ) .
The mammalian factor BSAP interacts with all four TSAP-binding sites in a manner indistinguishable from that of the sea urchin protein .
Within the hematopoietic system , BSAP is exclusively expressed in the B-cell lineage with equal binding activity in pro-B , pre-B , and mature B cells , while it is undetectable in terminally differentiated plasma cells .
BSAP was shown to act as a positive transcription factor on an artificial promoter containing a sea urchin TSAP-binding site .
Known regulatory regions of immunoglobulin and class II major histocompatibility complex genes , however , lack high-affinity BSAP-binding sites , suggesting that BSAP regulates a different set of B-lymphoid-specific genes ( 3 ) .
Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the human CD19 gene and show by in vitro and in vivo protein-DNA binding studies that the CD19 promoter is a target for the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP .

12 , 1992 Screening of cosmid library , subcloning , and DNA sequencing .
A human cosmid library constructed in the vector pcos2-EMBL ( 8 ) was obtained from A.-M. Frischauf ( Lon-don , England ) and screened with randomly primed insert DNA of a CD19 cDNA clone ( 33 ) according to standard procedures ( 19 ) .

RESULTS Strict correlation between CD19 gene expression and BSAP activity in B-cell lines .
A literature search previously indicated that the expression pattern of the CD19 gene may be similar to that of the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP , suggesting an involvement of BSAP in the regulation of this gene ( 3 ) .
As a first step towards testing this hypothesis , we have investigated this correlation in more detail .
A large panel of murine and human B-lymphoid cell lines previously analyzed for BSAP-binding activity ( 3 ) was thus analyzed for CD19 gene expression by S1 nuclease mapping ( Fig .
1 ) .
S1 probes that map an internal portion of CD19 mRNA were generated by subcloning small fragments of murine and human CD19 cDNAs ( see Materials and Methods ) .
CD19 signals were normalized by reference to glycer-aldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) mRNA .
As shown in Fig .
1 , the CD19 gene is expressed in all pro-B- , pre-B- , and B-cell lines but not in plasma cells , with two exceptions .
The human plasma cell line HS-Sultan expresses CD19 mRNA , while this transcript is absent from the murine cell line LyD9 , which was originally described as a pro-B-cell line ( 25 ) and was subsequently identified as a multipotential bone marrow stem cell clone ( 18 ) .
There is , however , complete correlation between BSAP and CD19 gene expression in both the mouse and human systems , as all CD19-positive cell lines contain BSAP-binding activity , whereas all CD19-negative cell lines lack this activity ( 3 ) .
For all mouse B-lymphoid cells , this correlation extends even to the level of gene expression , since the CD19-expressing cell lines contain not only the same amount of CD19 mRNA ( Fig .
1A ) but also similar levels of BSAP-binding activity ( 3 ) .

CD19 gene expression in murine and human B-lymphoid cell lines .
( A ) Murine B-lymphoid cell lines .
Total RNA ( 15 ug ) of each cell line was simultaneously analyzed by S1 nuclease mapping with a 5'-end-labeled mouse CD19 and a rat gapdh S1 probe ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The specific radioactivity of the gapdh probe was 10-fold lower than that of the CD19 probe .
Sl-resistant DNA fragments were separated on an 8 % polyacrylamide sequencing gel together with an end-labeled DNA size marker ( lane M ; pUC18 digested with MspI ) .
Input denotes the position of the two intact S1 DNA probes .
Correct protection by the CD19 mRNA results in an 88-nucleotide-long Sl-resistant DNA fragment .
The triplet below it is generated by S1 digestion into an A+T-rich sequence of the RNA-DNA hybrid .
All cell lines were previously analyzed for the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of BSAP-binding activity , as indicated at the bottom ( 3 ) .
( B ) Human B-lymphoid cell lines .
Total RNA ( 20 pg ) of each cell line was separately analyzed with a human gapdh and a human CD19 S1 probe .
Bandshift analysis of nuclear extracts with a sea urchin TSAP probe revealed the same amount ( + ) of BSAP activity in the cell lines Ramos , MC/CAR , IM-9 , and HS-Sultan as in the other previously analyzed cell lines ( 3 ) , while RPMI 8226 cells lack BSAP activity ( - ) ( unpublished data ) .
The autoradiographic exposure time for both CD19 S1 gels was 7 days at -70Â°C .
Sizes are indicated in nucleotides .
strict correlation between CD19 and BSAP expression supports our hypothesis that the CD19 gene is a target for BSAP regulation and predicts that a BSAP-binding site ( s ) should be part of the regulatory region of the CD19 gene .
An alternative explanation is that another transcription factor with the same expression profile regulates both the CD19 and BSAP genes .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , we cloned and analyzed the human CD19 gene .
Cloning and characterization of the human CD19 gene .
The Bam HI L7 : Hind IZ CD19 gene was isolated from a human genomic cosmid library by screening with a homologous cDNA probe ( 33 ) .
One of several positive cosmid clones was further characterized by subcloning and DNA sequencing .
Comparison with published cDNA sequences ( 33 , 34 ) revealed that the human CD19 gene is 7.37 kb long and consists of 15 exons ( Fig .
2 ) .
The first four exons encode the N-terminal extracellular domain , exon 5 contains the transmembrane region , and exons 6 to 14 code for the intracellular portion of the [ ~- Xba I Â£Sac -s by to & I HA 1 1 kb Km_-_ -- -- -- A & M I2 CAL _ in 7 8 9 101112 13 14 15 kp -- -- -- -- - XS -__- I -- -- -- AK -- - FIG .

Mapping of the initiation sites of CD19 gene transcription .
( A ) S1 nuclease analysis .
Poly ( A ) * RNA ( ~5 pug ) of each cell line was analyzed by S1 mapping with a DNA probe that was end labeled at an Aval site in the first exon of the CD19 gene and that extends 300 bp up to the next Xbal sites in the promoter .
Sl-resistant DNA fragments were electrophoresed on a denaturing 8 % polyacrylamide gel together with the cleavage products of the G+A sequencing reaction of the same DNA probe .
One-tenth of each poly ( A ) * RNA ( ~0.5 ug ) was standardized in a separate S1 experiment with a human gapdh DNA probe .
The nucleotide positions relative to the labeled Aval end are indicated at the left .
( B ) RNase protection experiment .
Total RNA ( 20 g ) of BJA-B and RPMI 8226 cells was hybridized to a riboprobe containing the CD19 sequences from the Aval site ( exon 1 ) to the Xbel site ( promoter ) and then subjected to RNase digestion and analysis on an 8 % sequencing gel as described previously ( 36 ) .
An end-labeled MspI digest of pUC19 DNA was used as size marker ( lane M ) .
( C ) Summary of 5'-end mapping .
The RACE method was used to clone the 5'-terminal sequences of CD19 mRNA from BJA-B cells .
Twenty-one cDNA clones were sequenced , and their starting nucleotides are indicated by arrows .
The published cDNA sequence ( 33 ) starts 15 nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon , which is underlined .
The transcription initiation sites as mapped by S1 nuclease analysis are indicated below by filled and open arrowheads corresponding to intense and weak S1 signals , respectively .
The number of transcription start sites may have been overestimated by S1 nuclease mapping in comparison with the RNase protection experiment , possibly because of `` nibbling '' of the S1 nuclease at the 5 ' end of the protected DNA fragments .
CD19 protein .
The CD19 cosmid clone analyzed contains 1.3 kb and ~30 kb of 5 ' and 3 ' flanking sequences , respectively .
Heterogeneous initiation of CD19 gene transcription .
The 5 ' ends of the relatively rare CD19 mRNA were mapped by three different , highly sensitive methods ( Fig .
3 ) .
Poly ( A ) * RNA was used for S1 nuclease analysis with a DNA probe that was 5 ' end labeled at the Aveal site in the first exon ( Fig .
3A ) .
An identical pattern of heterogeneous start sites was observed for three CD19-positive cell lines ( MC/CAR , REH , BJA-B ) .
Alignment with the control sequence ladder ( G+A ) mapped these start sites within a 40-bp-long , highly G+C-rich DNA sequence immediately adjacent to the translation initiation codon ( Fig .
3C ) .
A similar pattern of heterogeneous start sites was obtained by RNase protection analysis of BJA-B RNA with an antisense RNA probe that spans the same sequences used for S1 mapping ( Fig .
3B ) .
Finally , we have identified the 5Â° ends of CD19 transcripts in BJA-B RNA by the RACE procedure ( 10 ; see Materials and Methods ) .
Twenty-one independent cDNA clones were isolated , and their starting nucleotides were determined by DNA sequencing ( Fig .
3C ) .
The shortest of these cDNA clones corresponded to the 5Â° end of the published CD19 cDNA sequence ( 33 ) .
In conclusion , all three methods revealed heterogeneous initiation of CD19 gene transcription within a 40-bp G+C-rich DNA sequence .
In agreement with this finding , there is no TATA-like sequence in the immediate upstream region .
Mapping of BSAP-binding sites in the CD19 gene .
An important prerequisite for the rapid identification of BSAP-binding sites on the CD19 cosmid clone was the availability of partially pure BSAP protein , which was isolated from BJA-B cells by a two-step procedure ( 1 ) .
Typically , BSAP represented ~10 % of the total protein in the final fraction , corresponding to a 5,000-fold enrichment .
Such a BSAP preparation was used for multiple bandshift assay ( 16 ) .
An end-labeled MspI digest of the CD19 cosmid DNA was incubated with increasing amounts of BSAP prior to separation on a native polyacrylamide gel ( Fig .
4A ) .

Identification of BSAP-binding sites in the 5 ' region of the CD19 gene ( A ) Multiple bandshift assay .
An end-labeled MspI digest of CD19 cosmid DNA was incubated with ( lanes 2 to 5 ) or without ( lanes 1 and 6 ) purified BSAP protein prior to electrophoretic separation on a native 4 % polyacrylamide gel .
An oligonucleotide containing the TSAP-binding site of the sea urchin H2A-2.2 gene was used as a specific competitor in lanes 4 and 5 .
Arrowheads indicate the position of MspI fragments with BSAP-binding sites .
( B ) DNase I footprint analysis .
MspI fragments A to C were cloned into the Accel site of plasmid pSP64 , and end-labeled DNA fragments containing these inserts were used for DNase I footprint analysis in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of purified BSAP protein .
A map of the 5 ' region of the human CD19 gene is shown below ; the positions of MspI fragments A to C and the six DNase I-protected BSAP-binding sites are indicated .
H , high-affinity BSAP-binding site ; M , BSAP site with an affinity 4-fold lower than that of the sea urchin TSAP-binding sites ; L , BSAP site with an affinity 16-fold lower than that of the TSAP-binding sites .
was that any DNA fragment containing one or more BSAP-binding sites should form a complex upon BSAP binding ( Fig .
4A , lanes 2 and 3 ) and thus be retarded in its migration relative to the unbound DNA fragment ( Fig .
4A , lanes 1 and 6 ) .
The MspI fragments labeled A to H ( except for C ) clearly showed this behavior , and furthermore , their retardation was prevented by the addition of increasing amounts of specific competitor DNA to the binding reaction mixture ( Fig .
4A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Comparison of the MspI digestion pattern of the entire cosmid clone with that of three different subclones ( Fig .
2 ) allowed us to map fragments A and C to the 5 ' region ( clone HA ) , fragment B to the central part ( clone AX ) , and fragment H to the 3 ' part ( clone XS ) of the CD19 gene ( 15a ) .
Fragments D to G must therefore originate from the 3 ' flanking sequences .
No BSAP-binding sites were mapped to MspI fragments of the cosmid vector .
The MspI fragments A and B were subcloned , and their precise positions on the CD19 map were determined by DNA sequencing .
BSAP recognition sequences within these DNA fragments were then identified by DNase I footprinting ( Fig .
4B ) .
DNase I footprints 1 to 6 could all be competed for with an excess of a wild-type but not a mutant BSAP-binding Vor .

Interaction of BSAP with the two promoter-proximal binding sites .
( A ) Bandshift assay .
An oligonucleotide containing the TSAP-binding site of the sea urchin H2A-2.2 gene ( 2 ) and the two CD19 oligonucieotides shown below were used as end-labeled probes for bandshift assay with a nuclear extract of BJA-B cells .
A 100-fold excess of the unlabeled TSAP-binding site and of the Pu motif of the simian virus 40 enhancer ( 26 ) was added as competitor DNA to the binding reaction , where indicated .
( B ) Methylation interference analysis .
The two oligonucleotides shown in panel C were cloned into the Sa/l site of pSP64 , and HindIII-EcoRI restriction fragments that were 5 ' end labeled at either the HindIII or EcoRI site were used for methylation interference analysis with purified BSAP protein .
F and B denote free and bound DNA , respectively .
Black arrowheads point to methylated G residues that interfere with BSAP binding , and open arrowheads indicate G residues that enhance protein binding upon methylation .
( C ) Summary of BSAP interaction with sites 1 and 2 .
The CD19 promoter sequences used for oligonucleotide synthesis are shown .
Brackets above and below the DNA sequences indicate the extent of the DNase I protection by BSAP ( Fig .

site , demonstrating that all six footprints are generated by BSAP ( 15a ) .
Fragment C did not score positive in the multiple bandshift assay , probably because of comigration with another DNA fragment ( Fig .
4A ) .
It was cloned only as a contamination of fragment B and subsequently proved to contain a -binding site upon DNase I footprint analysis ( Fig .
4B ) .
Oligonucleotides corresponding to the six DNase I-protected sequences were used for the bandshift competition assay to measure their relative affinities for BSAP .
These experiments revealed that only site 1 exhibits the same high affinity as do the sea urchin TSAP-binding sites , while sites 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 are of medium affinity and site 4 is of low affinity ( unpublished data ; see legend to Fig .
4 ) .
The high-affinity BSAP-binding site 1 is located immediately upstream of the heterogeneous transcription start sites of the CD19 gene ( see Fig .
9 ) in a position that is analogous to that of the TATA box in most RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes .
Interaction of BSAP with the two sites in the CD19 promoter .
The interaction of BSAP with its two binding sites in the CD19 promoter was analyzed in more detail by bandshift assay and methylation interference analysis .
End-labeled oligonucleotides containing these two binding sites ( Fig .
5C ) detect only BSAP in unfractionated nuclear extracts of BJA-B cells , as the complex formed can be specifically competed for with an excess of a sea urchin TSAP-binding site but not with the unrelated recognition sequence of the PU.1 factor ( Fig .
5A ) .
The close contact sites of BSAP within the two recognition sequences were mapped by methylation interference analysis ( 32 ) , the result of which is summarized in Fig .
5C .
Four interfering G residues are present in analogous positions within both recognition sequences , suggesting correct alignment of both BSAP sites with each other in the same orientation as they occur in the CD19 promoter ( see also Discussion ) .
BSAP is the only abundant factor interacting with the human CD19 promoter in unfractionated B-cell extracts .
So far , we have studied only the interaction of purified BSAP with the CD19 gene .
Using unfractionated extracts of B-lymphoid and HeLa cells , we next investigated whether other nuclear factors also bind to the CD19 promoter .
As shown in Fig .

In vitro footprint of the CD19 promoter in unfractionated nuclear extracts .
( A ) DNase I footprint of the human CD19 promoter .
The coding strand of the CD19 gene was 3 ' end labeled at a Sauw3A site in the promoter , and this DNA probe was incubated with either partially purified BSAP protein or unfractionated nuclear extracts of BJA-B and HeLa cells prior to DNase I digestion and electrophoresis on an 8 % sequencing gel .
An oligonucleotide containing the TSAP-binding site of the H2A-2.2 gene was used as a specific competitor .
The extent of DNase I protection is indicated by brackets .

The DNA probe was 3 ' end labeled at a HpaII site in the transcription initiation region of the human CD19 promoter , incubated in unfractionated nuclear extracts , briefly exposed to DMS , and then subjected to chemical cleavage at methylated G residues and separation on a denaturing 8 % polyacrylamide gel .
Black arrowheads point to protected G residues ; open arrowheads indicate hyperreactive guanosines .
( C ) DNase I footprint of the mouse CD19 promoter .
The DNA probe was 3 ' end labeled at a BamHI site which was introduced into the first exon by PCR cloning ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The putative positions of BSAP site 2 and the transcription initiation region in analogy to the human CD19 promoter are indicated by dashed lines .
same DNase I footprint pattern on the CD19 promoter as did purified BSAP protein .
This result suggests that BSAP is the only abundant DNA-binding protein capable of interacting with the proximal promoter of the CD19 gene in BJA-B cells .
This conclusion is supported by the methylation protection experiment shown in Fig .
6B .
An end-labeled CD19 promoter fragment was incubated in different nuclear extracts , briefly exposed to DMS , and then subjected to cleavage at methylated G residues and to electrophoretic analysis .
Specific G residues within BSAP sites 1 and 2 were protected from methylation only by three BSAP-positive extracts ( Raji , REH , and BJA-B ) and by the purified BSAP protein .
In fact , the same G residues prevented BSAP binding in the methylation interference experiment shown in Fig .
5 .
No G residues outside of the two BSAP sites were protected , while two guanines were hyperreactive in BSAP-positive nuclear extracts for unknown reasons .
The control HeLa cell nuclear extract contains an activity that also bound to the BSAP site 2 sequence but generated a DNase I footprint distinct from that of BSAP ( Fig .
6A ) .
This activity was not further characterized and could not even be detected in the DMS protection experiment ( Fig .
6B ) , possibly because of differences in the binding condition of the two assays .
A DNA fragment spanning the first 200 bp of the CD19 promoter was used as a probe for bandshift experiments with BJA-B nuclear extracts .
Again no specific DNA-binding activity other than BSAP was identified by this method ( 15a ) .
We therefore conclude that BSAP is the only abundant DNA-binding protein that interacts in vitro with the proximal promoter of the human CD19 gene .
Evolutionary conservation of BSAP site 1 .
The mouse CD19 promoter was cloned by a genomic walking technique ( 9 ) which is based on the ligation-mediated PCR method previously developed for in vivo footprinting ( 22 ) .
The only information required for this cloning procedure was the mouse CD19 full-length cDNA sequence ( 38 ) , allowing the Vor .

In vivo footprint of the CD19 promoter .
Intact BJA-B , HeLa , and RPMI 8226 cells or naked DNA isolated from BJA-B cells were incubated with DMS , and DNA was isolated and subjected to chemical cleavage at methylated G residues , linker liga-tion , and PCR amplification as described by Mueller and Wold ( 22 ) .

design of 5'-terminal , CD19-specific primers .
The mouse promoter was isolated as a 670-bp PCR fragment ( see Materials and Methods ) .
DNA sequence analysis revealed that the BSAP-binding site 1 has been relatively well conserved between the human and mouse CD19 promoters , as only 4 of 26 nucleotide positions differ by point mutation ( see Fig .
10 ) .
In contrast , an insertion of six nucleotides was found in the putative BSAP site 2 of the mouse promoter .
In agreement with this finding , purified BSAP bound only to site 1 of the mouse promoter , as shown by the DNase I footprint experiment of Fig .
6C .
Bandshift competition experiments furthermore demonstrated that BSAP binds to both the mouse and human BSAP site 1 with the same high affinity ( 152 ) .
BSAP binds in vivo to its high-affinity binding site in the CD19 promoter .
The interaction of BSAP with the CD19 promoter was next investigated by in vivo footprinting using the ligation-mediated PCR method described by Mueller and Wold ( 22 ) .
BJA-B , RPMI 8226 , and HeLa cells were briefly exposed to DMS , and genomic DNA was isolated and cleaved at methylated G residues .
After complementary strand synthesis , the DNA was subjected to linker ligation and exponential amplification of CD19 promoter sequences with specific oligonucleotides ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Figure 7 demonstrates that exactly the same methylation protection pattern is observed for BSAP site 1 in BJA-B cells in vivo as is seen with nuclear extracts in vitro ( Fig .
6 ) .
In addition , two G residues in the middle of the transcription initiation region are partially protected .
There is , however , no evidence for an in vivo interaction of BSAP with the distal site 2 in BJA-B cells ( compare Fig .
6B and 7 ) .
Moreover , no protection of site 1 is seen in the BSAP REGULATION OF THE CD19 GENE BY BSAP 2669 J558L - SP2/0 Co Co 10 6 o so so .

Evidence that the BSAP-binding site 1 is a functional promoter element in B cells .
The test plasmids OVEC-S and OVEC-CD19 were transiently transfected into BJA-B , J558L , and SP2/0 cells together with OVEC-Ref , and expression of the B-globin reporter gene was analyzed by SP6 mapping as described in Materials and Methods .
BJA-B is a human B-cell line ; J558L and $ P2/0 are two mouse plasma cell lines .
OVEC-S and OVEC-Ref were described by Westin et al .
( 37 ) .
OVEC-CD19 contains the BSAP site 1 oligonucleotide ( flanked by Sa/l ends ; Fig .

negative RPMI 8226 and HeLa cells .
In summary , we have demonstrated that the proximal high-affinity site of the CD19 promoter is fully occupied in vivo by BSAP in a CD19-expressing B-cell line .
BSAP site 1 is a functional promoter element in B cells .
The evolutionary conservation and the in vivo footprint experiment strongly suggest that the high-affinity BSAP site 1 is a functional promoter element .
We have tested this supposition by the transient transfection experiment shown in Fig .
8 .
An oligonucleotide containing the BSAP site 1 was cloned upstream of the TATA box of the rabbit B-globin gene in the vector OVEC-S ( 37 ) .
This test plasmid and the parental vector were transfected into the B-cell line BJA-B and the two plasma cell lines J558L and SP2/0 together with a reference gene containing a deletion in the B-globin leader sequence ( OVEC-Ref [ 37 ] ) .
Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated 48 h later , and transcripts of both the test and reference genes were mapped by RNase protection assay .
The BSAP site 1 of the human CD19 gene clearly functions as an efficient promoter element to stimulate B-globin gene transcription in B cells but not in plasma cells .
A similar experiment previously demonstrated that the TSAP-binding site of the sea urchin H2A-2.2 gene confers B-cell specificity to the same B-globin reporter gene ( 3 ) .
We therefore conclude that the BSAP site 1 of the CD19 gene is not only biochemically equivalent but also functionally similar to the sea urchin TSAP-binding site .
DISCUSSION The B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP was previously identified as a mammalian homolog of the sea urchin 2670 KOZMIK ET AL .

protein TSAP .
Competition experiments did not reveal any high-affinity BSAP-binding site in known regulatory regions of immunoglobulin and class II major histocompatibility complex genes , suggesting that BSAP may regulate a different set of B-lymphoid-specific genes ( 3 ) .
In this report , we describe the cloning and characterization of the human CD19 gene .
Five lines of evidence indicate that BSAP is involved in the regulation of this gene .
First , complete correlation was observed between CD19 gene expression and BSAP activity in a large panel of murine and human B-lymphoid cell lines .
Second , a high-affinity BSAP-binding site was found immediately upstream of the transcription start sites of the CD19 gene .
Third , this high-affinity binding site has been evolu-tionarily conserved between the human and mouse CD19 promoters .
Fourth , in vivo footprinting demonstrated that this site is fully occupied by BSAP in a CD19-expressing B-cell line but not in nonexpressing cells .
Fifth , this high-affinity BSAP site was shown to function as an efficient promoter element in transiently transfected B cells .
Figure 9 summarizes the results of our CD19 promoter analyses .
Transcription of the human CD19 gene starts at multiple sites within a 40-bp G+C-rich sequence , as shown by three different methods .
A very similar situation has been described for another B-cell-specific gene coding for the B29 protein ( 15 ) .
Such heterogeneity of mRNA 5 ' ends is normally observed with genes that lack a canonical TATA box in their -30 promoter regions ( 4 , 12 ) .
In agreement with this finding , there is no TATA-like sequence in the proximal promoter of the CD19 gene .
The high-affinity site 1 which is bound by BSAP in vivo is instead located in the -30 region ( Fig .
9 ) .
We have previously shown that a BSAP-binding site cooperates with a TATA element to bring about efficient transcription of a reporter gene in transiently transfected B cells ( 3 ) .
The specific location of BSAP site 1 in the CD19 promoter now suggests that BSAP , like Spl ( 28 ) and GCN4 ( 6 ) , is capable of interacting with the transcription machinery even in the absence of a TATA box .
BSAP is the only abundant DNA-binding activity present in B-cell nuclear extracts that could be shown to interact with the first 200 bp of the CD19 promoter by in vitro protein-DNA binding studies .
The human CD19 promoter contains a second BSAP-binding site of lower affinity which is located 35 bp upstream of site 1 .
However , no evidence for an interaction of BSAP with this site in vivo was obtained .
Moreover , this second binding site has been eliminated from the mouse CD19 promoter by insertion of six nucleotides into the corresponding sequence ( Fig .
6C and 9 ) .
It is therefore likely that the second BSAP-binding site of the human CD19 promoter plays only a minor role , if any , in CD19 gene transcription .
We have previously shown that the DNA sequence recognition of BSAP is identical to that of the sea urchin transcription factor TSAP ( 3 ) .
Only a degenerate consensus sequence for TSAP could be deduced from four high-affinity binding sites of sea urchin histone genes , and comparison of three different parameters ( primary sequence , DNase I foot-print , and methylation interference pattern ) was required for correct alignment of all four sequences ( 2 ) .
Analysis of the same three parameters for BSAP sites 1 and 2 of the human CD19 promoter resulted in the best alignment with the TSAP consensus sequence , as shown in Fig .
10 .
A gap of one nucleotide had to be introduced into site 2 , which may explain its lower affinity for BSAP .
Preliminary mutational analysis is in agreement with the alignment shown in Fig .
10 .
A C-to-A mutation at the position corresponding to the only strictly invariant C residue of the TSAP consensus sequence ( Fig .
10 ) reduces the affinity of BSAP site 1 by a factor of 5 , while insertion of an A residue eliminating the gap in site 2 creates a high-affinity binding site ( 15a ) .
The high-affinity site 1 of the CD19 gene functions as an TSAP consensus - - - GACaCca- -- BSAP site 1 ( m ) - A G A CWR c # Tica ta BSAP site 1 ( h ) - A G A eB tat aclictcca BSAP site 2 ( h ) _ A A T He c @ iiiec MRR cate ce FIG .

8 ) .
The BSAP site 1 is therefore functionally similar to the -binding site of the H2A-2.2 gene , which was previously analyzed in the same manner in B-lymphoid cells ( 3 ) .
These data suggest , but do not prove , that the high-affinity BSAP site 1 is important for B-cell-specific regulation of the CD19 gene .
A rigorous examination of this question critically depends on an efficient expression system for the CD19 gene , that allows a mutational analysis of BSAP site 1 in its normal promoter context .
We have fused 1,300 or 300 bp of CD19 5 ' flanking sequences in the first exon to a rabbit B-globin gene which either lacked or contained a downstream simian virus 40 , Igk , or IgH enhancer or additional multimerized -binding sites .
With all of these constructs we failed , however , to detect transcription from the human CD19 promoter in transiently transfected B cells ( 36a ) .
It is still possible that far upstream or downstream sequences of the CD19 gene which are absent from our constructs are absolutely required for expression .
We note , however , that the CD19 mRNA is not at all abundant in expressing B-lymphoid cells ( Fig .
1 ) , suggesting low transcriptional activity of the endogenous CD19 promoter .
This observation combined with the poor transfection efficiency of B-cell lines may explain our failure to detect CD19 promoter activity .
The human BSAP gene has recently been cloned ( 1 ) , and hence loss-of-function experiments eliminating BSAP activity from B lymphocytes can now be used as alternative approaches to determine the role of BSAP in CD19 gene regulation .
The CD19 gene is most likely just one of several BSAP target genes in B-lymphoid cells .
Analysis of two other candidate genes , mb-1 ( 30 ) and Lyb-2 ( 24 ) , demonstrated that only the expression pattern of the mb-1 gene strictly correlates with the presence of BSAP activity in the same panel of cell lines analyzed in Fig .
1 ( 7a ) .
However , the recent characterization of the mb-1 gene promoter did not reveal any -binding site but instead led to the identification of a novel transcription factor .
This DNA-binding activity , termed EBF , is required for efficient transcription of the mb-1 gene and shows an expression profile similar to that of BSAP ( 13 ) .
So far we have not detected any EBF-binding site in the 5 ' flanking sequences of the CD19 gene .
It will be of special interest to determine whether BSAP is involved in the regulation of the EBF gene or vice versa .
As the BSAP gene has been isolated , the tools should now be available to address this question and more generally to study the functional significance of BSAP for B-cell differentiation .
