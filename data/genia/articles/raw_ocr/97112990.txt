Within the region between -108 and -40 base pairs of the IFN-y promoter are two conserved and essential regulatory elements , which confer activation-specific expression in T cells .
This report describes studies indicating that the most proximal of these two regulatory elements is an important determinant of its restricted expression .
The proximal element is a composite site that binds members of the CREB/ATF , AP-1 , and octamer families of transcription factors .
Jun is essential for activation-induced transcription and binds preferably as a heterodimer with ATF-2 .
In contrast , CREB appears to dampen transcription from this element .
The CpG dinucleotide in this element is selectively methylated in Th2 T cells and other cells that do not express IFN-y , and methylation markedly reduces transcription factor binding .
As a target for DNA methylation and for binding of transcription factors that mediate or impede transcription , this element appears to play a central role in controlling IFN-y expression .
Differential expression of lymphokines by individual T cells is central to the proper regulation of the immune response and in resistance to infection .
For example , production of interferon-y ( IFN- ' y ) 1 facilitates host defense to intracellular patho-gens .
In contrast , IL-4 appears to antagonize host defense to such agents while contributing to protection from intestinal helminths and facilitating the development of allergic responses ( 1 , 2 ) .
Consequently , abnormal regulation of lymphokine production contributes to the pathogenesis of certain infectious , allergic , and autoimmune diseases .
Since the production of these and other cytokines by T cells in response to activation is predominantly regulated at the level of transcription ( 3-5 ) , it follows that differential transcription of lympho- * This work was supported in part by Grants AIO1117 and HD94022 ( to L.

31964 kine genes is essential to a properly regulated immune response .
Activation of T cells leads to an increase in intracellular Ca '' * , which activates calcineurin , and protein kinase C and c-Jun amino-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases are trig-gered .
Recent work has established the mechanism by which these events lead to the activation of IL-2 and IL-4 transcription .
Both promoters contain regulatory elements that engage one or more NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) proteins ( 6-11 ) .
Preformed NFAT resides in the cytosol in resting T cells and translocates to the nucleus on activation ; this translocation is regulated by calcineurin , the action of which is inhibited by cyclosporin ( 7 , 9 , 12 , 13 ) .
Calcineurin also acts in concert with protein kinase C to activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinases , which phosphorylate Jun and ATF-2 ( activating transcription factor ) ( 14 ) .
Jun and Fos ( AP-1 ( activator Brotein » proteins bind in concert with NFAT to multiple sites in the IL-2 ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) and IL-4 ( 9 , 17 ) promoters and thereby contribute to transcriptional activation .
However , the transcription factors binding to these elements are common to cell types other than T cells , and the distal NFAT site and the P1 NFAT site can be exchanged between the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters without affecting specificity of promoter function for Th1 ( T helper lympho-cytes ) and Th2 T cell clones , respectively ( 9 , 18 ) .
Thus , these elements are sufficient to account for activation-specific , cyclosporin-sensitive promoter function , but not for specificity of their promoters .
Like IL-2 , IFN-y expression is restricted to the Th1 subset of primed CD4* T cells , whereas IL-4 is expressed by Th2 cells .
IFN-y expression does not completely parallel that of IL-2 since IFN-y is expressed by primed but not naive T cells and , among primed T cells , also is highly expressed by the CD8* subset , whereas IL-2 is not ( 2 , 4 , 19 , 20 ) .
Despite its importance in regulation of the immune response , compared with IL-2 and IL-4 , little information exists regarding the regulation of IFN-y expression .
We recently reported that the proximal 108 bp of 5'-flanking sequence from the IFN-y gene are necessary and sufficient to confer T cell and activation-specific , cyclosporin-sensitive expression and that the activity of this region is associated with two essential and evolutionarily conserved elements ( 21 ) .
The proximal element ( -73 to -48 bp ) shares homology with the NFIL-2A element of the IL-2 promoter ( 21 ) and is a target for methylation at its central CpG dinucleotide ( 22 ) .
Methylation at this site correlates strongly and inversely with the capacity of primary T cell populations and Th1 and Th2 T cell clones to express IFN-y ( 22 , 23 ) .
This suggests that the IFN-y proximal element is likely to play an important role in the regulation and perhaps the specificity of this lympho-kine 's expression .
This work indicates that the IFN-y proximal element , like This paper is available on line at http : //www-jbc.stanford.edu/jbc/ 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Control of IFN-y Expression 0.035 @ uns 0.030 | |Giono G PMA 0.025 | | @ P g 0.020 | Lol 2 B .

Activation requirements of the proximal element of the IFN-y promoter .
Constructs containing no promoter ( pEQ3 ) , the basal ( pIFN-39 ) or full-length ( pIFN-538 ) IFN-y promoter , or the proximal element dimer were transfected into Jurkat T cells , which were unstimulated ( uns ) or stimulated with 1.5 uM ionomycin ( tono , I ) and/or 25 ng/ml PMA ( P ) in the absence or presence of 500 ng/ml cyclosporin A ( CSA ) .

elements defined in the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters , is a composite binding site for a complex array of transcription factors including ATF-2 , c-Jun and other Jun proteins , CREB ( cAMP response element-binding protein ) , ATF-1 , and Oct-1 ( octamer ) .
c-Jun engages this element , preferentially as a heterodimer with ATF-2 , and activates transcription in response to T cell activation .
In contrast , CREB and ATF-1 , which are cAMP- and calcium/calmodulin-responsive transcription factors ( 24 ) , also bind to this element with high affinity , and CREB impedes transcription .
In addition , methylation of the central CpG dinucleotide of this element diminishes transcription factor bind-ing , which is consistent with the inverse relationship between methylation of this element and expression of IFN-y by T cell subsets .
These observations suggest that the proximal element of the IFN-y promoter , through competitive engagement of transcription factors and differential methylation , is likely to play an important role in the selective expression of IFN-y in T cells .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Lines and Reagents-The line of Jurkat T cells ( which expresses IFN-y following activation ) , the human monocyte-macrophage cell line U937 ( American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) , and the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line 816 ( D. Pious , University of Washington , Seattle ) were maintained as described previously ( 21 ) , except that the 816 cells were grown in medium supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum ( Hyclone Laboratories , Logan , UT ) .
L929 murine fibroblasts were grown as described previously ( 25 ) .
The following antibodies to transcription factors were used .
For the CREB/ATF family , anti-CREB-1 ( C-21 ) , anti-ATF-1 ( C41-5.1 ) , anti-CREB-1/ATF-1/CREM ( 25C10G ) , and anti-ATF-4 ( 25 ) were mouse monoclonal antibodies , and anti-ATF-3 ( C-19 ) was a rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) ; monoclonal ( F2BR1 ) and rabbit polyclonal ( F2poly ) antibodies to human ATF-2 were provided by J. P. Hoeffler ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
For the AP-1 and octamer families , rabbit polyclonal anti-Jun [ D ] ) , anti-c-Jun-specific ( c-Jun/AP-1 [ N ] ) , anti-Fos ( K-25 ) , and anti-Oct-l were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Plasmid Constructs-The pIFN-588- , pIFN-108- , pIFN-89- , and plIL2-568-6-galactosidase reporter and B-actin-CAT constructs were described previously ( 21 ) .
Plasmids containing head-to-tail ( 5 ' to 3 '' ) dimers of the IFN-y proximal element ( -71 to -44 bp from the transcription start site ) were generated by subcloning ligated oligomers synthesized with terminal Bg/II ( 5 ' ) and BamHI ( 8 ' ) restriction sites into the pIFN-89 basal promoter construct .
Proximal dimers with mutations M1-M4 ( see Fig .
5A ) were produced in a similar manner .
The full-length promoter ( pIFN-588 ) containing the M5 ( C to T ) mutation 31965 was prepared by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis and splicing by overlap extension ( 26 ) to generate a 240-bp fragment that was subcloned into pIFN-588A-177/-109 ( 21 ) .
The sequence of each construct was confirmed with dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing .
Plasmids containing the cDNAs for CREB and CREB containing a mutation in the DNA-binding domain that allows dimerization but blocks binding to target DNA ( KCREB ) ( 27 , 28 ) were obtained from R. H. Goodman ( Vollum Institute , Oregon Health Sciences University , Portland , OR ) .
Plasmids containing cDNAs for murine ATF-2 ( CRE-BP2.1 ) and murine ATF-2 with a mutation abrogating DNA binding ( CRE-BP1mu ) were obtained from K. Georgopoulos ( Massachusetts General Hospital , Charlestown , MA ) ( 29 ) .
Plasmids containing wild-type human ATF-2 ( ATF-2FL ) and a truncated form lacking the transcriptional activation domain ( ATF-2BR ) ( 80 ) and wild-type c-Jun ( 81 , 32 ) have been described ; the plasmid containing c-Jun with a deletion of residues 260-266 in the DNA-binding domain ( c-JunABR ) was analogous to that described in Ref .
33 .
These cDNAs were received or cloned into the pReRSV vector ( Invitrogen ) .
Transient Transfection Assays-Jurkat , U9837 , and 816 cells were transiently transfected with both 30 ug of IFN-y B-galactosidase plasmid and 16 ug of control B-actin-CAT plasmid in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium by electroporation ( ECM600 , BTX Inc. , San Diego , CA ) at 250 V , 186 ohms , and 1900 , 1500 , or 1050 microfarads , respectively .
In cotransfection experiments , the indicated amounts of expression plasmids containing transcription factor cDNAs under the control of the RSV ( Rous sarcoma virus ) promoter were also included .
The total amount of RSV vector per cuvette was kept constant by the addition of control pRcRSV plasmid lacking a cDNA insert .
After electroporation , the cells were unstimulated or stimulated with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate ( PMA ) as described previously ( 21 ) .
Where indicated , cells were pretreated for 20 min with cyclosporin A ( 500 ng/ml ) .
Cell lysates were analyzed for B-galactosidase activity using chlorophenol red as substrate ( 34 ) and corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing to CAT content as described previously ( 21 ) .
L929 cells were transiently transfected with 5 ug of IFN-y B-galactosidase plasmid and 2.5 ug of control B-actin-CAT plasmid using 400 ug/ml DEAE-dextran for 3 h and then shocked with 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline for 1-2 min .
The cells were stimulated , and cell lysates were prepared as described above .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays-Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells that were untreated or stimulated for 2 h as described ( 21 , 35 , 36 ) .
CREB-1 ( the DNA-binding domain , amino acids 254-827 ) , from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , as well as recombinant c-Jun ( the DNA-binding domain , amino acids 199-834 ) and c-Fos ( the DNA-binding domain , amino acids 139-200 ) , provided by T. K. Kerppola ( 82 ) , were purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography of bacterial lysates ( 87 ) .
Recombinant ATF-1 ( full-length ) and ATF-2BR ( the DNA-binding domain , amino acids 350-505 ) were obtained from boiling lysis preparations of bacteria without further purification and are ~90 % pure ( 30 ) .
Sequences of oligonucleotides used ( with their consensus sequences underlined ) are as follows : the IFN-y proximal element ( -71 to -47 bp ) , 5'-AAAACTTGTGAAAATACGTAATCCT-3 ' ; the NFIL-2A element ( 36 ) , 5-GAAAATATGTGTAATATGTAAAACAT-3 ' ; the consensus so-matostatin CRE ( cAMP response element ) ( 88 ) , 5'-GATCCGGCTGAC-GTCATCAAGCTA-3 '' ; the consensus metallothionein Ia AP-1 element ( 89 ) , 5-GAGCCGCAAGTGACTCAGCGCGGG-3 ' ; and the consensus DRa octamer ( 40 ) , 5-CTGACCATTAAAATGCAAATCAATTACTCTT-TGG-3 ' .
The GATA element of the T cell receptor-a enhancer ( 41 ) , 5'-GTTAGAGATAGCATCGCCCCA-3 ' , was used as a nonspecific com-petitor .
Oligonucleotides were labeled , and the binding reactions were performed as described previously ( 21 ) , except that reactions containing recombinant proteins were incubated in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES , pH 7.5 , 125 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , 2 mM phenylmethylsul-fonyl fluoride , and 2 pg/ml pepstatin A .
In experiments using antiserum or monoclonal antibodies to specific transcription factors , these were routinely preincubated with nuclear extracts for 2 h on ice before the addition of probe .
Bound complexes were resolved on 6 % Duracryl gels ( Millipore Corp. , Bedford , MA ) at room temperature in 0.4 X Tris borate/EDTA buffer , and then the gels were dried and autoradiographed overnight .
DNA Binding Assays-The DNA template for the footprinting experiment was made by end labeling a human ( -850 to +50 bp ) IFN-y promoter fragment at the downstream end .
The binding reactions and DNase I digestions were carried out as described previously ( 9 ) .

Lanes 6-11 demonstrate the ability of excess ( 10 ng ) unlabeled oligonucleotides to compete for binding to the IFN-y proximal probe .
Competitors were as follows : lane 6 , IFN-y proximal element ( wild type , WT ) ; lane 7 , CRE ; lane 8 , NFIL-2A ; lane 9 , octamer ; lane 10 , AP-1 ; and lane 11 , a nonspecific ( NS ) control oligonucleotide .

Antiserum was as follows : lanes 1 , 4 , 7 , and 10 , none ; lanes 2 and 5 , polyclonal Jun family ( pan-Jun ) ; Control of IFN-y Expression binding reactions with the Jurkat nuclear extracts utilized 3 ug of protein .
RESULTS The IFN-y Proximal Element Directs Activation-specific , Cyclosporin-sensitive Expression in T Cells-Using transient transfection of reporter constructs containing 10-bp scanning internal deletions , our laboratory identified two highly con-served , regulatory elements in the immediate 5'-flanking sequence of the human IFN-y gene , which were necessary for activation-specific and cyclosporin-sensitive expression in Jurkat T cells ( 21 ) .
To determine if the most proximal of these transcriptional regulatory elements , like the intact IFN-y promoter , is sufficient to confer activation-specific and cyeclosporin-sensitive expression , two tandem copies of this element were placed upstream of the basal IFN-y promoter driving expression of a B-galactosidase reporter gene and transfected into Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Expression from the proximal dimer construct was stimulated to the same extent as that from the full-length promoter ( pIFN-538 ) by ionomycin and PMA and was blocked by cyclosporin ( > 85 % ) .
Likewise , expression of both these constructs was minimal in unstimulated cells and in cells stimulated with ionomycin or PMA alone .
Thus , a dimer of the proximal element was sufficient for properly regulated expression in Jurkat T cells .
In contrast to the robust expression observed in Jurkat T cells , expression from the proximal dimer and the full-length promoter constructs was similar to that from a promoterless construct ( pEQ3 ) and lower than that from the basal promoter construct ( pIFN-39 ) in unstimulated or stimulated U937 mono-cyte-macrophages or L929 fibroblasts ( data not shown ) .
Very low levels of expression were observed in the 816 B cell line , which is consistent with data indicating that transformed B cell lines express IFN-y in low amounts ( 42 , 43 ) .
Thus , like the full-length promoter , the proximal dimer appears sufficient to confer activation- and cell lineage-specific expression .
The IFN-y Proximal Element Binds Members of the CREB/ ATF , AP-1 , and Octamer Families-The proximal element of the IFN-y promoter has partial homology to the NFIL-2A element of the IL-2 gene , which binds octamer , AP-1 ( including c-Jun , JunD , and Fos proteins ) , and NFAT proteins ( 10 , 36 , 44-46 ) .
The binding sites of AP-1 and CREB/ATF transcription factors are closely related , and certain members of these families can form cross-family heterodimers ( 47 ) .
Accordingly , binding of nuclear proteins to the IFN-y proximal element probe was compared with that of probes containing NFIL-2A , octamer , AP-1 , and CRE elements by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
In previous studies , EMSA of the proximal IFN-y element showed two intense complexes , A and B ( 21 ) , which are now resolved into doublets , and a previously undetected intermediate-mobility complex .
Also noted in response to activation , the A1 complex is barely detectable , and A2 is the predominant complex ( Fig .
2A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
This difference was seen in five independently prepared Jurkat nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
When used as unlabeled competitors in EMSA ( Fig .
24 ) , the CRE oligonucleotide markedly reduced all the complexes generated by the IFN-y proximal element probe , with the exception of the intermediate-mobility complex .
The NFIL-2A competitor completely blocked formation of the intermediate lanes 3 and 6 , c-Jun-specific ; lanes 8 and 11 , polyclonal Fos family ( pan-Fos ) ; and lanes 9 and 12 , c-Fos-specific .

IFN-y proximal element is capable of binding recombinant ATF-1 , CREB , Jun , and Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers .
A , EMSA using CRE ( Zanes 1-4 ) , the proximal IFN-y element ( Zanes 5-8 ) , AP-1 ( lanes 9-12 ) , and NFIL-2A ( Zanes 13-16 ) as probes with recombinant proteins in the presence of 25 ng of poly ( dI-dC ) .
For each probe , a 10 nM concentration of the indicated recombinant protein was added : CREB ( amino acids 254-827 ) , ATF-1 ( full-length ) , CREB plus ATF-1 , or ATF-2 ( amino acids 350-505 ) .
B , EMSA using the same probes with recombinant c-Jun ( amino acids 199-334 ) , c-Jun plus ATF-2 , ATF-2 , or c-Jun plus c-Fos ( amino acids 189-200 ) .
For each probe , c-Jun and c-Fos were added at 100 nM and ATF-2 at 10 nM .
Note that since the recombinant proteins used were , with the exception of ATF-1 , the DNA-binding domains rather than the full-length proteins , the mobility of the complexes in these EMSAs can not be compared directly with that of the proteins present in Jurkat T cell extracts shown in the other figures .
Probes mobility complex and inhibited formation of the other complexes .
The AP-1 oligonucleotide partially competed for the A2 and B complexes , but much less than seen with CRE .
Together , these results suggest the presence of CREB/ATF and AP-1 proteins in complexes formed with the proximal element .
To confirm this and to identify the specific factors contained within each complex , antisera specific for the various factors were added to the binding reactions .
Antibodies to CREB/ ATF-1 proteins supershifted or attenuated the B1-B2 complexes , suggesting the presence of ATF-1 , CREB , and perhaps other members of the CREB/ATF-1 family ( Fig .
2B , lanes 6-8 ) .
The results were similar with extracts from unstimulated and stimulated cells ( data not shown ) .

DNase I footprint analysis of the IFN-y proximal element .
Recombinant NFAT , AP-1 ( c-Jun and Fra-1 ) , and ATF-2 proteins or nuclear extracts from unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells were tested for binding to the IFN-y promoter .
The region corresponding to the proximal element ( from -40 to -78 bp ) is shown .
The lane labeled GA is a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reaction showing the purine sequence of the labeled complementary strand .
A schematic depicting the regions protected by AP-1 and ATF-2 ( boxed ) is shown .
The central ACGT sequence in the region of CRE homology is underlined for reference .
( Fig .
2B , lanes 2 and 3 ) , but only partially blocked or supershifted the more prominent A2 complex in stimulated cells ( lanes 9 and 10 , complex indicated by arrow ) .
Antibodies to ATF-3 and ATF-4 had no consistent effects upon the IFN-y proximal element complexes ( data not shown ) .
An antiserum recognizing all Jun proteins completely blocked the A2 complex in both stimulated and unstimulated extracts ( Fig .
2B , lanes 4 and 11 ) , and a c-Jun-specific antiserum produced a supershifted complex in stimulated Jurkat extracts ( Fig .
2C , lane 6 ) .
In contrast , antibodies to the Fos family of proteins or to c-Fos had no effect on complexes formed with the proximal element probe , although each antibody blocked and/or supershifted complexes formed with an AP-1 probe ( Fig .
2C , lanes 7-12 ) .
Several observations suggest that the intermediate complex is generated by binding of Oct-1 to the IFN-y proximal element ( Fig .
24 ) .
1 ) The intermediate-mobility complex comigrated with the predominant complex generated by the NFIL-2A probe .
2 ) This complex was inhibited by the IFN-y proximal element , NFIL-2A , and consensus octamer oligonucleotides , but not by CRE- or AP-1l-containing oligonucleotides .
3 ) Oct-1-specific antiserum blocked formation of this complex and the corresponding NFIL-2A complex , but had little or no effect on the A or B complexes ( data not shown ) .
Results obtained with recombinant transcription factors supported the results obtained with Jurkat T cell extracts .
The IFN-y proximal element probe readily bound recombinant CREB , CREB/ATEF-1 , and ATF-2 , whereas ATF-1 bound poorly alone ( Fig .
34 , lanes 5-8 ) .
The AP-1 and NFIL-2A oligonucleotides bound these proteins less well ( Fig .
34 , lanes 9-16 ) .
c-Jun homodimers and c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers formed complexes with the IFN-y proximal element , although the complexes generated were less intense than those bound by either the consensus CRE or AP-1 probes ( Fig .
3B ) .
When c-Jun and ATF-2 were added together in the ratio yielding optimal binding ( 10 : 1 ) , essentially all complexes ran with a mobility intermediate between those seen with either protein alone , suggesting that c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers were preferred ( Fig .
3B , lane 6 ) .

Identification of the bases critical for binding of transcription factors to the IFN-y proximal element .

The central ACGT sequence is underlined , and the regions footprinted by AP-1 and ATF-2 are indi-cated .
B , EMSA using wild-type or mutated oligonucleotides as probes binding 3 pg of unstimulated ( U ) or stimulated ( S ) Jurkat nuclear extract with 200 ng of poly ( dI-dC ) .

The reactions contained 5 nM CREB ( amino acids 254-827 ) ( lane 1 ) Control of IFN-y Expression In contrast , the AP-1 and NFIL-2A probes bound ATF-2 and c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers poorly or not at all compared with c-Jun or c-Jun/c-Fos .
To better define the regions of interaction of these proteins with the proximal element , DNase I footprint analysis was performed .
Recombinant ATF-2 protected a large region of the proximal element spanning from -63 to -43 bp , whereas AP-1 ( recombinant c-Jun and Fra-1 ) protected an overlapping but smaller region ( -63 to -53 bp ) ( Fig .
4 and data not shown ) .
NFATp , either alone or in conjunction with AP-1 or ATF-2 , did not bind to this region .
The region protected by recombinant ATF-2 corresponded to that protected by the Jurkat nuclear extracts .
No differences were seen in the footprints generated with unstimulated or stimulated nuclear extracts or when AP-1 and ATF-2 were added together ( data not shown ) .
In summary , these results suggest that the IFN-y proximal element binds CREB , ATF-1 , ATF-2 , and c-Jun under conditions similar to those required by elements containing these consensus motifs .
CREB/ATF-1 and c-Jun/ATF-2 bind readily as heterodimers .
Upon stimulation , c-Jun is induced and binds as a homodimer or preferentially as a heterodimer with ATF-2 .
Although not observed , the presence of Jun/Fos heterodimers in low abundance can not be excluded .
In contrast to the NFIL-2A element , NFATp does not bind to this site .
Mutations within the Proximal Element Identify Bases Critical for Binding and Markedly Reduce Reporter Gene Expres-ston-The central ACGT sequence of the IFN-y proximal element is highly conserved ( 21 ) , lies within the sequence with the best homology to a consensus CRE motif , and is within the region protected by ATF-2 and AP-1 in the footprint analysis .
Consistent with this , these were identified as the most critical bases for binding in EMSA ( Fig .
5 ) .
A probe containing the M3 mutation , which disrupts this sequence , failed to bind any of the specific complexes usually seen with the wild-type probe , with the exception of a more rapidly migrating complex ( Fig .
5B , lanes 7-8 ) .
The M5 mutation , which consists of a single base change from C to T within the CRE motif , bound only the Oct-1 complex ( Fig .
5B , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
The retention of Oct-1 binding may be due to reconstitution of the sequence AATAT-GTAA found in the NFIL-2A element , which overlaps the putative octamer motif ( 36 ) , and was confirmed using Oct-1 antisera ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , oligonucleotides with the M1 , M2 , and M4 mutations had minimal effects .
The M1 and M4 mutations produced complexes that were identical to the wild-type probe .
Although the M1 mutation appears to bind complexes more intensely , this was not a consistent finding .
Similar results were seen with the M2 mutation , except it did not form the Oct-1 complex ( Fig .
5B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The bases in the center of the CRE homology were also critical for binding of recombinant proteins .
In Fig .
5C , the results with heterodimers of CREB/ATF-1 and Jun/ATF-2 are shown .
Results with the individual recombinant factors were similar ( data not shown ) .
When used as competitors , the M1 , M2 , and M4 oligonucleotides competed nearly as well as the wild type , but the M3 and M5 mutations failed to alter binding of complexes to the wild-type IFN-y element to any appreciable extent .
The effects of these mutations on expression were tested by transient transfection of reporter constructs containing head-to-tail dimers of the proximal element with the M1-M4 mutations or with the full-length IFN-y promoter ( pIFN-538 ) containing the C to T mutation ( M5 ) .

In contrast , the reporter constructs with the M1 and M2 muta-tions , which minimally affected binding by EMSA but which are within the region footprinted both by ATF-2 and by AP-1 , showed markedly decreased expression .
In contrast , the reporter construct with the M4 mutation , which is located at the 3'-end of the proximal element in a region footprinted only by ATF-2 , was expressed at levels comparable to those of the wild-type proximal element dimer and the full-length IFN-y promoter ( pIFN-538 ) .
Role of Jun , ATF-2 , and CREB in Regulation of Expression via the IFN-y Proximal Element-The data described above suggested that members of the CREB/ATF-1 , ATF-2 , and Jun families play an important role in the function of the proximal element .
To assess this , wild-type and dominant-negative mutated genes were tested in cotransfection assays .
Wild-type CREB , which as a homodimer or heterodimer with ATF-1 was the most abundant complex observed by EMSA , had an inhibitory effect on expression from the proximal dimer ( Fig .
7B ) ; a similar trend , although not statistically significant , was observed with the full-length promoter ( Fig .
7A ) .
These effects were not observed with the DNA-binding mutant KCREB .
The DNA-binding mutant of c-Jun ( c-JunABR ) consistently and markedly inhibited expression from both the full-length promoter and proximal dimer constructs even at low concentrations ( Fig .
7 , C and D ) .
Wild-type c-Jun had little effect on the proximal dimer , but at higher concentrations inhibited the full-length promoter .
In contrast to the results with cotransfection of CREB , c-Jun , and their mutants , cotransfection of wild-type human ATF-2 or of a dominant-negative ATF-2 mutant containing only the DNA-binding domain ( ATF-2BR ) did not consistently affect expression ( Fig .
7 , E and F ) .
Likewise , cotransfection of murine ATF-2 ( CRE-BP2.1 ) or of a mutant containing a mutation in the DNA-binding domain ( CRE-BP 1mu ) had little effect ( n = 3 ) ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that CREB and c-Jun have opposing effects on the IFN-y proximal element and promoter , whereas a role for ATF-2 was not demonstrated by these cotransfection experiments .
Methylation of the CpG Dinucleotide Impedes Binding of Factors to the IFN-y Proximal Element-Previous studies indicated that the degree of methylation of the CpG dinucleotide within the IFN-y proximal element correlates inversely with the capacity of T cell populations or T cell clones to produce this lymphokine ( 22 , 23 ) .
In CD4* Thl clones , this CpG is fully demethylated , whereas in Th2 clones , it is fully methylated ; this difference is selective in that there is not a general hypo-methylation of all CpG dinucleotides in the IFN-y gene in Th1 as compared with Th2 T cell clones ( 22 ) .
To determine the effect of methylation on binding of transcription factors to this element , EMSA was performed with oligonucleotide probes containing 5-methyleytosine in the CpG of each strand .
Compared with non-methylated IFN-y proximal element and CRE probes , the characteristic complexes formed with stimulated Jurkat nuclear extracts were markedly reduced when methylated probes were used ( Fig .
8A ) .
In addition , novel faster migrating complexes were observed with the methylated IFN-y proximal element probe .
The lower apparent binding affinity of the methylated oligonucleotides for CREB , ATF-2 , and Jun proteins present in nuclear extracts was confirmed using non-methylated probes and methylated oligonucleotides as unlabeled competitors ( data not shown ) .
Consistent with this , a methylated IFN-y proximal element oligonucleotide competed much less effectively than the non-methylated 31969 A 0.035 0.030 | 0.025 L. i- < .

The effect of methylation on competition for binding of CREB was generally more pronounced than on competition for binding of ATF-2 and c-Jun ; this is consistent with previous studies that showed that binding of CREB and ATF-1 to the T cell receptor V ; decamer element is more sensitive to methylation of the CpG dinucleotide than binding of ATF-2 ( 48 ) .
DISCUSSION The current results indicate that the proximal element of the IFN-y promoter plays an important role in gene regulation and may contribute to the differential expression of this lymphokine .
As shown , the proximal element contains sufficient information to mimic with a high degree of fidelity the properties of the endogenous gene and of the full-length promoter with respect to activation requirements and cell lineage-specific expression .
Furthermore , in transiently transfected primary human T cells , the IFN-y proximal element dimer directs activation-specific expression , which is 30-fold greater than that of the basal promoter ( pIFN-39 ) , '' and T cells from trans-genic mice in which a dimer of this element directs expression of a luciferase reporter gene produce luciferase in an activa- 2 L.

The IFN-y proximal element displayed a complex binding pattern , engaging Oct-1 , CREB/ATF-1 , ATF-2 , and Jun proteins , while lacking a consensus element for any of these transcription factors .
Previous studies have demonstrated that members of the CREB/ATF and AP-1 families display binding affinities that vary with dimer composition and that depend on the sequence of the binding site ( 47 , 49 , 50 ) .
As seen in Fig .
3 , the proximal element more closely resembles a CRE-like site and displayed a pattern of binding similar to , but distinct from , that of the CRE , AP-1 , and NFIL-2A elements .
The results obtained by EMSA also are supported by preliminary fluorescence anisotropy data ( 51 ) : ATF-2 bound to the IFN-y proximal element with higher affinity than did CREB or GST/c-Jun and bound this element with an affinity similar to that of a consensus CRE , while CREB and GST/c-Jun bound the consensus CRE with greater affinity than the proximal element ( data not shown ) .
These findings suggest that multiple factors bind to the IFN-y proximal element , but binding by ATF-2-containing complexes may be favored .
Jun or Jun/ATF-2 Facilitate IFN-y Promoter-mediated Transcription-The simplest interpretation of the EMSA , foot ° T. Aune , L. A. Penix , M. Rincon , and R. Flavell , submitted for publication .

9 ) .
T cell activation results in the calcineurin-dependent activation of c-Jun amino-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases , which phosphorylate c-Jun and ATF-2 ( 14 , 52 ) , and would allow these proteins to participate in transcription ini-tiation .
Supporting this interpretation is the inhibitory effect of the c-Jun DNA-binding domain mutant , which blocked transcription from the full-length IFN-y promoter and the proximal element dimer .
At high concentrations , Jun partially inhibited expression from the full-length promoter , suggesting that c-Jun , or transcription factors with which it interacts , may act on regions within the IFN-y promoter in addition to the proximal element .
The lack of an inhibitory effect of full-length c-Jun on the proximal element may reflect its ability to function in this context as a homodimer , whereas it may interact more efficiently as a heterodimer at other regions in the IFN-y promoter .
Preliminary results suggest that the distal element of this promoter is one such region ( data not shown ) .
Additional evidence supporting a role for Jun or Jun heterodimers comes from a recent report by Young and co-workers ( 53 ) , who found that cotransfection of c-Jun plasmids containing activation do 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Control of IFN-y Expression A Probes meth IFN meth CRE IFN CRE AM Az C ct w * bo IFN-y __ meth IFN-y _- ] .

Methylation of the central CpG dinucleotide within the IFN-y proximal element alters binding with Jurkat nuclear extracts and recombinant factors .

main mutations inhibited IFN-y promoter function , although the locus of the inhibitory effect was not defined .
The current studies indicate that c-Jun contributes to activation through the proximal element of the IFN-y promoter , but do not exclude a role for other Jun proteins in this process .
Functional overlap among different Jun family proteins has been suggested in the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters ( 9 , 15 , 16 , 54 ) .
In contrast to the results observed with c-Jun constructs , no consistent effect on transcription was observed when murine or human wild-type ATF-2 or two different types of dominant-negative ATF-2 were cotransfected along with the IFN-y promoter or proximal element constructs .
Similarly , no effect of ATF-2 was observed when it was cotransfected in combination with c-Jun ( data not shown ) .
This was not anticipated from the EMSA studies , which suggested that Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers would bind preferentially over other Jun-containing complexes in stimulated extracts .
However , this is consistent with the results of the footprinting and transfection experiments , which demonstrated that mutations within the region footprinted jointly by AP-1 and ATF-2 inhibited expression ; by contrast , 31971 Unstim Stim IFN-y Proximal Element 7 Fic .

Schematic representation of factors interacting with the IFN-y proximal element .
The proximal element exhibits an identical DNase footprint in unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells , but EMSA and transfection data suggest that the proteins contributing to the footprints and to transcription mediated by this element are altered by T cell activation .
In unstimulated ( Unstim ) T cells , CREB , ATF-1 , ATF-2 , and Jun family proteins other than c-Jun are present , whereas in stimulated ( Stim ) T cells , c-Jun or c-Jun/ATF-2 dimers are present .
c-Jun and c-Jun/ATF-2 are thought to be phosphorylated by c-Jun amino-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases when T cells are activated .
The center of this element contains a CpG dinucleotide , the methylation of which impedes transcription factor binding and is observed in types of T cells ( e.g .
Th2 T cells ) that do not transcribe IFN-y .
the M4 mutation , which is within the region footprinted by ATF-2 but not by AP-1 , had no effect .
These results support the notion that Jun-containing dimers are necessary for transcriptional activation , but the other constituent of Jun-containing dimers may not be critical .
It is also possible that ATF-2 is not limiting in Jurkat T cells or that the effects observed in cotransfection assays were in part indirect since ATF-2 and c-Jun ( and CREB ) also play a role in regulating the expression of AP-1 proteins ( 55 ) .
In support of our data showing the lack of an essential role of ATF-2 in IFN-y expression , mice in which the ATF-2 gene has been inactivated by homologous recombination do not differ from wild-type mice in the expression of IFN-y mRNA in response to anti-CD3 antibodies .
* Cotransfection of CREB reduced transcription mediated by the IFN-y proximal element and , to a limited extent , transcription from the full-length promoter , whereas the DNA-binding mutant KCREB had no effect .
These results suggest that CREB and/or other factors with which it forms heterodimers may have a net inhibitory effect on activation-induced IFN-y proximal element function ( Fig .
9 ) .
This inhibitory effect probably reflects competition between CREB/ATF-1 and Jun for binding to the IFN-y proximal element .
Since phosphorylation of CREB in T cells may enhance its binding to DNA ( 56 ) , elevation of cAMP could contribute to this dampening effect ; this is consistent with the observation that agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit IFN-y production ( 57 ) .
Interest-ingly , IL-4 transcription is not impeded by cAMP ( 58 , 59 ) , and differences in sensitivity to or content of cAMP have been proposed to contribute to differential lymphokine production or proliferation by Thl and Th2 CD4* T cells ( 60 ) .
Potential Role of the Proximal Element in Selective IFN-y Expression-In addition to the potential interactions of both positively and negatively acting transcription factors at this site , a CpG dinucleotide within the proximal element of the IFN-y promoter serves as a target for methylation .
Since methylation impeded binding of Jun or Jun/ATF-2 proteins to this element ( Fig .
8 ) , methylation may raise the effective threshold concentrations of phosphorylated Jun or Jun/ATF-2 needed to activate transcription above that generally present in activated T cells in situ .
Consistent with this , methylation of the IFN-y *L. H. Glimcher , personal communication .

In addition to impairing the binding of transcription factors , methylation of DNA at CpG dinucleotides may impair promoter function by other mechanisms .
Methylated CpG engages specific proteins ( 61 , 62 ) that may block access of other transcription factors and may alter overall chromatin structure ( 63 ) .
Thus , the presence of the CpG-con-taining proximal element may provide a locus at which cells can markedly limit , if not block , the capacity of the endogenous IFN-y gene to be transcribed .
In sum , the current results indicate that the IFN-y proximal element , like the IFN-y promoter , is selectively active in T cells .
This selectivity does not appear to reflect the binding of transcription factors that are unique to cells that express this lymphokine .
Rather , the IFN-y promoter contains within its proximal element the potential to engage proteins that mediate transcription ( c-Jun or c-Jun/ATF-2 dimers ) or that repress transcription either through the competitive binding of transcription factors having minimal agonistic activity ( CREB/ ATF-1 ) or through methylation of the central CpG dinucleotide of this element ( Fig .
9 ) .
This parsimonious use of a single transcriptional regulatory element may be important in allowing T cells to rigorously control the expression of this potent immunoregulatory lymphokine .
