Clonality of Isolated Eosinophils in the Hypereosinophilic Syndrome By Hsiao-Wen Chang , Kah-Hoo Leong , Dow -Rhoon Koh , and Szu-Hee Lee The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome ( IHES ) is a rare disorder characterized by unexplained , persistent eosinophilia associated with multiple organ dysfunction due to eosinophilic tissue infiltration .
In the absence of karyotypic abnormalities , there is no specific test to detect clonal eosinophilia in IHES .
Analysis of X-chromosome inactivation patterns can be used to determine whether proliferative disorders are clonal in origin .
Methylation of Hpall and Hha | sites near the polymorphic trinucleotide repeat of the human androgen receptor gene ( HUMARA ) has been shown to correlate with X-inactivation .
In this study , we have used the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with nested primers to analyze X-inactivation patterns of the HUMARA loci in purified eosinophils from female patients with eosinophilia .
Peripheral blood eosinophils were isolated by their autofluo-resence using flow cytometric sorting .
Eosinophils purified from a female patient presenting with IHES were found to HE IDIOPATHIC hypereosinophilic syndrome ( IHES ) is a rare disorder characterized by persistent eosinophilia of unknown origin often associated with multiple organ dysfunction as a result of infiltration by tissue eosinophils and the toxic effects of their released granule contents . ''
There is no specific test that is diagnostic for IHES ; rather the syndrome is defined as the combination of unexplained prolonged eosinophilia and evidence of organ involvement . ?
It must be distinguished from reactive , clinically benign eosinophilia associated with para-sitic , allergic , and other unexplained causes of eosinophilia , '' and also from eosinophilic leukemias associated with increased blast cells and cytogenetic abnormalities .
Moreover , some patients with IHES may show features usually associated with myeloproliferative syndromes such as splenomegaly and throm-bocytopenia .
'* '' Cases of clonal eosinophilia as evidenced by karyotypic abnormalities in bone marrow cells can usually be classified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia , myelodysplastic syndromes , or myeloproliferative disorders . ''
However , in the absence of karyotypic abnormalities , the distinction between these entities and IHES may be difficult .
A method that can detect clonal eosinophilia could allow more accurate diagnosis and treatment of cases presenting as IHES and help to clarify its relationship to the myeloproliferative disorders .
Analysis of maternal and paternal X-chromosome activation status has been used as a means of determining whether certain proliferative disorders are clonal in origin .
'~'* These methods are based on the assumption that random inactivation of one X-chromosome occurs in each somatic cell during early embryo-genic development , and that this is passed on to the progeny of the cell in a stable fashion .
'~'* Therefore , some cells from a normal female carry active maternal X-chromosome , while other cells carry active paternal X-chromosome .
Differential methylation patterns between the active and inactive X-chromosome have been documented at several loci such as the phosphoglyc-erate kinase ( PGK ) , hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( HPRT ) , and the hypervariable DXS255 ( M27B ) loci . ''
Recently , Allen et al° have shown that methylation of Hpall and Hha | sites near the polymorphic trinucleotide CAG repeat of the human androgen receptor gene ( HUMARA ) correlates with X-inactivation .
Digestion of DNA with a methylation-sensitive Blood , Vol 93 , No 5 ( March 1 ) , 1999 ; pp 1651-1657 show a clonal pattern of X-inactivation .
Eosinophil-depleted leukocytes from this patient were polyclonal by HUMARA analysis , thus excluding skewedness of random X-inactivation .
After corticosteroid suppression of her blood eosinophilia , a clonal population of eosinophils could no longer be detected in purified eosinophils .
In contrast , eosinophils purified from a patient with Churg-Strauss syndrome and from six patients with reactive eosinophilias attributed to allergy , parasitic infection , or drug reaction showed a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation by HUMARA analysis .
The finding of clonal eosinophilia in a patient presenting with IHES indicates that such patients may have , in reality , a low-grade clonal disorder that can be distinguished from reactive eosinophilias by HUMARA analysis .
Further , the method described can be used to monitor disease progression .

restriction endonuclease , such as Hpall , permits the distinction of the active ( unmethylated ) from the inactive ( methylated ) X-chromosome .
Therefore , one strategy to determine whether eosinophils from female patients with IHES are clonal would be to analyze the X-inactivation patterns of the HUMARA loci in purified eosinophils .
In a recent report , Luppi et al ' '' analyzed the methylation status of the PGK gene in granulocytes from a female IHES patient with 70 % eosinophilia and found this to show a clonal pattern by Southern hybridization .
However , PGK gene analysis is restricted by a low incidence of constitutional heterozygosity of approximately 40 % in the general female population . '' ''
By contrast , the HUMARA loci have been reported to show a much higher incidence of constitutional heterozygosity of approximately 90 % . ''
Further , it would be an advantage to extend such studies to patients with lesser proportions of eosinophils in the peripheral blood by isolating eosinophils for clonality analysis .
Human eosinophils emit marked fluorescence at 520 nm when excited at 450 nm due to their fluorescent granule contents , and this property may be used to purify eosinophils for study . '' ''
Here , we have purified peripheral blood eosinophils by their autofluorescence using flow cytometric sorting and investigated the clonality of purified eosinophils from female From the Department of Pathology , the National University Medical Institutes ; the Department of Physiology , National University of Singapore ; and the Division of Haematology , National University Hospital , Singapore .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation Peripheral blood samples in EDTA were collected from the patients studied .
Informed consent was obtained from all patients in this study , which was approved by the local Institutional Review Board ( Ethics ) .
Red blood cells were lysed with buffer containing 15.5 mmol/L NH , CI , 1 mmol/L KHCOs ; , and 10 umol/L Na ; EDTA .
White blood cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes .
After centrifugation , the samples were resuspended in 5 mL phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7.4 ) and washed twice .
Each sample was then separated by flow cytometry into a purified eosinophil fraction and an eosinophil-depleted leukocyte fraction .
Isolation of eosinophils from peripheral blood leukocytes by flow cytometry and cell sorting .
Eosinophils were separated by flow cytometry based on their autofluorescence and granularity '* ' to greater than 90 % purity ( Figs 1 and 2 ) .
Flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting was performed on a FACStar '' ~ '' '' flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) .
Cells were excited with a 488-nm argon ion laser and fluorescence was measured through a BP 525 nm ( FL1 detector ) and 575 nm ( FL2 ) filters .
Results were analyzed using the LYSYS II version 1.1 software ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Cells were sorted at a cell flow rate of 800 events/s .
A small sample of sorted cells were cytospun onto glass slides for Giemsa staining to confirm either eosinophil purity ( Fig 2 ) or eosinophil depletion by morphology .
The remainder of the sorted cells were processed for DNA extraction .

Five microliters of sequencing gel-loading buffer ( 95 % formamide , 10 mmol/L EDTA , 0.025 % bromophe-nol blue ) were added to the reaction mixture .
Four microliters of this mixture were loaded onto a denaturing 6 % ( 39:1 acrylamide/bis with 6 mol/L urea ) gel and electrophoresed at 80 W for 3 hours .
The gel was dried and exposed .
HUMARA clonality analyses of all the samples in this study were repeated at least twice to ensure that the results were reproducible .
To obtain the proportional expression of the maternal and paternal alleles in HUMARA analysis , band intensities from the autoradiographs were analyzed using Molecular Analyst software ( Bio-Rad Laborato-ries , Hercules , CA ) .
The proportional expression of the two alleles was obtained as described by Gale et al , '' '' except that the final ratio was expressed as percentages of the total signal from the two alleles .
Briefly , the intensity of each band after Hpall digestion was first corrected by dividing it by the signal obtained for that allele in the undigested sample .
The intensity of the signals from the two alleles was then expressed as a ratio .
The ratio was finally expressed as a percentage of the total signal for the two alleles .
Therefore , a ratio of 50:50 would represent equal ( balanced ) expression of the two alleles .
RESULTS Patients Studies were performed on eight female patients ( mean age , 48.5 years ; range , 41 to 65 years ) with eosinophilia ( Table 1 ) .
The diagnosis in one patient ( case 1 ) was consistent with IHES , and in another ( case 2 ) , with the Churg-Strauss syndrome .
Eosinophilia in the remaining patients ( cases 3 to 8 ) was judged clinically to be reactive in nature based on a likely cause for eosinophilia , such as drug reaction due to phenytoin ( case 3 ) , parasitic infection due to Strongyloidiaisis ( case 4 ) , atopic A - A1 Hpail Hpall - > - > | | ( CAG ) n t & B1 B Fig 3 .

Serum folate was low at 6.6 nmol/L ( normal range [ NR ] = 10.0 to 40.0 nmol/L ) .
Serum vitamin B ; ; and the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score were in the normal range .
Polyclonal IgE was increased to 1,107 U/mL ( NR = 10.0 to 180 U/mL ) .
Rheumatoid factor , antinuclear factor , and anti-DNA antibodies were negative .
Stool examinations for ova , cysts , and parasites were repeatedly negative .
The bone marrow aspirate showed moderately hypercellular fragments with a marked increase in eosinophils and eosinophilic precursors .
Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells showed a normal karyotype .
She was treated with diuretics and folic acid and started on prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d .
Her symptoms improved dramatically with a fall in the AEC to 0.4 X 10°/L after 3 days of treatment .
During the first 12 months after initial presentation , her AEC rose above 1.5 X 10°/L on several occasions , accompanied by symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure .
As she refused therapy , control was reestablished by an increase in prednisolone dosage .
Twelve months after initial presentation , due to increasing side effects of corticosteroid therapy , hydroxyurea was substituted for prednisolone , but had to be discontinued 20 months after initial presentation due to worsening macrocytic anemia .
From that time until the present , the patient has been maintained on a small dose of prednisolone to suppress her eosinophil count .
During treatment , her serum IgE level fell , but remained mildly elevated at 356 U/mL , 26 months after initial presentation .
HUMARA analysis of purified blood eosinophils was performed at initial presentation and at 26 months after initial presentation .
Case 2 .
A 43-year-old Caucasian woman presented with rashes on her hands and paraesthesia and swelling of her feet for 10 days .
She gave a history of asthma for about 15 years , controlled with intermittent courses of corticosteroids and salbutamol .
Fifteen years ago , in a hospital abroad , she had been diagnosed with `` pulmonary eosinophilia '' and 2 years previ-ously , she had suffered a severe angioneurotic orbital cellulitis .
On examination she had vasculitic lesions on her hands and sensory loss to pinprick in a `` glove and stocking '' distribution of her hands and feet and bilateral pitting edema up to the midcalves .
Chest radiography showed old scarring and small areas of `` ground glass '' appearance consistent with pulmonary allergic granulomatosis .
The total white cell count was 26.5 % 10°/L , with 43 % eosinophils .
Biopsy of the skin lesions showed vasculitis and tissue eosinophilia .
IgE levels were elevated ( 895 U/mL ) .
Nerve conduction studies showed a mild sensory neuropathy of the lower limbs .
A large pericardial effusion was confirmed by doppler echocardiography .
Antineutrophil cytoplas-mic antibodies , anti-DNA antibodies , rheumatoid factor , and antifilarial antibody were negative .
A diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome with peripheral neuropathy and myositis was made .
Her symptoms are presently well-controlled with prednisolone and salbutamol .
HUMARA Analysis Amplification of the HUMARA gene by nested primers gives a 240-bp fragment that spans two Hpall cutting sites and the variable CAG tandem repeats ( Fig 3 ) .
Analysis of the HUMARA CHANG ET AL gene is based on the rationale that amplification by PCR can not take place if the active ( unmethylated ) X-chromosome is predigested with a methylation sensitive enzyme ( Hpall ) .
Methylation at these sites has been shown to correlate with X-inactivation , '' so that a product will only be obtained if the X-chromosome is inactive .
In a polyclonal cell population in which random X-inactivation has taken place , both alleles persist after Hpall predigestion so that in a high resolution polyacrylamide gel , two bands are seen , as the maternal inactive X-allele is distinct from paternal inactive X-allele because of a different number of CAG repeats .
By contrast , in a monoclonal cell population in which nonrandom X-inactivation has taken place , the active allele disappears after Hpall predigestion , as all cells contain the same inactive X-chromosome , '' so that only one band from either parental inactive X-allele is shown by gel electrophoresis .
The band representing an allele is sometimes accompanied by a minor band one trinucleotide repeat smaller , which is due to slippage of Taq polymerase along the repeated sequences . '' ''
PCR amplification of the hypervariable HUMARA target gene was performed on both purified eosinophil fractions and eosinophil-depleted leukocyte fractions from each patient .
Eosinophil-depleted leukocyte fractions consisted of variable proportions of a mixed population of peripheral blood neutro-phils , lymphocytes , and monocytes , with fewer than 10 % eosinophils .
These fractions served as polyclonal controls to exclude skewedness of X-inactivation that is found in a small proportion of females in HUMARA analysis. > '' '' In the patient presenting with IHES ( case 1 ) , peripheral blood eosinophils were purified to 98.5 % purity by flow cytometry at initial presentation ( Fig 1A ) .
Gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions of Hpall-digested samples of eosinophil-depleted leukocytes showed a band originating from each parental X-chromosome ( Fig 4 , cases 1A and 1B , WBC- ) .
Eosinophil-depleted leukocyte fractions from case 1 , therefore , showed a random ( polyclonal ) pattern of X-inactivation , thus excluding extreme skewedness of X-inactivation in this individual .
By contrast , HUMARA analysis of the purified eosinophil fraction from this patient at initial presentation ( Fig 4 , case 1A , EO ) showed only a band from one parental allele after Hpall digestion , consistent with a nonrandom ( clonal ) pattern of X-inactivation in the purified eosinophils .
Twenty-six months after initial presentation when the patient 's symptoms and blood eosinophil count ( AEC = 0.5 x 10°/L ) were controlled with a small dose of prednisolone , eosinophils were once again purified by flow cytometry ( Fig 1B ) for HUMARA reanalysis ( Fig 4 , case 1B ) .
The eosinophil content of the purified eosinophil fraction was 92 % ( Fig 1B ) .
By HUMARA analysis , a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation was seen ( Fig 4 , case 1B , EO ) , indicating either that the clonal eosinophilic population was absent or that it was insufficient , as a proportion of the total eosinophil population , to give rise to a clonal pattern .
Samples from case 1 were also assayed for clonality using PGK gene analysis by PCR , * '' but the patient was not heterozygous at the PGK locus , which was therefore uninformative ( not shown ) .

depleted leukocyte fractions showed a similar polyclonal pattern ( Fig 4 , case 2 ) , indicating that the purified eosinophils were of polyclonal origin in this condition .

Representative analyses are shown ( Fig 4 , cases 3 to 5 ) .
HUMARA results in all samples in this study were found to be consistent on repeated analyses .
DISCUSSION The distinction between a malignant and nonmalignant process in IHES can be extremely difficult , as there are no specific markers that can be applied to ascertain the clonality of eosinophils . ''
We have attempted to solve this problem by analysis of the X-inactivation status of the HUMARA loci in purified eosinophils from female patients with eosinophilia .
One patient presented with IHES , as evidenced by recurrent elevated AEC and organ damage involving the heart .
A second patient presented with vasculitic lesions , asthma , pulmonary eosinophilia , peripheral neuropathy , pericarditis , and myositis and clinically fulfilled the criteria for the Churg-Strauss syn-drome .
`` > '' The remaining six patients with reactive eosinophilia showed either transient or persistent eosinophilia that was attributable to drug reactions , allergies , or parasitic infection .
These cases were clinically benign and did not show evidence of organ damage associated with eosinophilia .
By X-inactivation analysis , we found clonal eosinophilia in the patient with IHES , whereas eosinophils were polyclonal in the patient with Churg-Strauss syndrome , and also in the six other patients with reactive eosinophilia .
Further , in the patient with IHES , analysis of eosinophil-depleted leukocyte fractions showed a polyclonal pattern of X-inactivation .
This indicated that the clonal pattern observed in purified eosinophils at initial presentation was not due to skewedness of random X-inactivation that could , in principle , result in an imbalanced expression of one allele in a population of cells .
Our patient presenting with IHES showed similarities to the case described by Luppi et al . ' ''
Both patients showed evidence of organ damage associated with sustained eosinophilia , an absence of features associated with myeloproliferative disor-ders , a normal bone marrow karyotype , a clonal eosinophilia by X-inactivation analysis , and corticosteroid-responsiveness with From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

1656 a favorable outcome .
In our patient ( case 1 ) , a very high IgE level at presentation was also found , which is associated with a good prognosis in IHES . ''
After therapy , the IgE level fell , but remained mildly elevated , although clonal eosinophilia could no longer be demonstrated .
In a previous study , 38 % of IHES patients were found to have markedly elevated IgE levels , suggesting an association between an IgE-mediated mechanism and eosinophilia in this subgroup. ? ''
These patients required no therapy or responded with a complete remission when treated with corticosteroids . ''
This interesting association raises the possibility that the eosinophilia and perhaps the organ damage in this subgroup of patients with IHES is associated with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response to an as yet unidentified antigen or antigens . ''
One advantage of HUMARA analysis compared with other X-inactivation markers is its high degree of informativeness , as the HUMARA loci show a high incidence of constitutional heterozygosity of approximately 90 % in the female population . '' ''
By contrast , the incidence of constitutional heterozygosity reported for other polymorphic X-linked markers , such as the PGK and HPRT loci , are significantly lower . '' ''
In practice , X-inactivation data may be corroborated by further analyses of other polymorphic X-linked loci .
We attempted to verify clonal eosinophilia in the patient presenting with IHES by PGK analysis , but the patient was found to be not heterozygous at the PGK locus .
It should be noted that clonality analysis using X-linked polymorphisms is only useful in females and , therefore , only in a minority of patients with IHES , as the majority ( approximately 90 % ) of these patients are male .
Eosinophil purification allows HUMARA analysis to be extended to detect clonal eosinophilia when the proportion of peripheral blood eosinophils is low .
This should , in principle , permit detection of clonal relapse in IHES patients and facilitate the assessment of therapeutic responses .
However , it has to be noted that an absence of clonal eosinophilia by this method of analysis can not completely exclude the possibilty that a minor clonal population of eosinophils may persist .
Long-term fol-low-up of our patient presenting with IHES is necessary to determine whether continued suppression of clonal eosinophilia by a low dose of corticosteroids can be maintained .
Although vasculitis is not a prominent feature of IHES , individual patients with IHES may exhibit pathologic evidence of vasculitis . ''
The major vasculitis that is associated with eosinophilia is the Churg-Strauss syndrome . ''
A history of asthma , nonfixed pulmonary infiltrates , blood eosinophilia greater than 10 % , paranasal sinus abnormalities , mononeuropa-thy or polyneuropathy , and a biopsied blood vessel demonstrating extravascular eosinophils are features of this syndrome . ''
In some patients , clear distinction between IHES and Churg-Strauss syndrome may not be possible .
However , our patient ( case 2 ) showed the characteristic features of this syndrome .
The finding that eosinophils were polyclonal in this patient provides definitive evidence that eosinophilia is reactive in nature in the Churg-Strauss syndrome .
There are several possible explanations for the underlying pathogenesis of a clonal eosinophilia in IHES .
Eosinophilic proliferation and differentiation is promoted by several cyto-kines , including interleukin ( IL ) -3 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and IL-5 , which is the most important CHANG ET AL and , in humans , is restricted to stimulating eosinophil produc-tion . '' ''
Reactive eosinophilias such as infections , allergies , drug reactions , skin diseases , connective tissue diseases , and malignancies are associated with eosinophilia through stimulation by IL-5 secreted by T cells .
*© Recently , there have been reports of a clonal population of T cells with an unusual phenotype , CD3~ , CD4* or CD3t+ , CD4~ , CD8~ , in the peripheral blood of several cases of eosinophilia , including IHES . '' '' '' ''
In one report , '' '' a patient with IHES who had excessive production of IgE was found to have a CD3~ , CD4* Type 2 helper T-cell clone that secreted high levels of IL-5 and IL-4 , which stimulates IgE production .
In patients with IHES who have high levels of IgE , it has been proposed that hypereosinophilia may result from an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response to an as yet unidentified antigen or antigens. ? ''
This subgroup of patients is characterized by responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy and a good prognosis , '' as seen in the case that we have described .
It is possible that hypereosinophilia in these patients may be due to a dysregulated , autonomous replication of a clonal population of eosinophils after stimulation by increased levels of IL-5 .
Other hypotheses for the pathogenesis of IHES have been suggested , such as defects in cytokine receptors , or in their signal transduction or suppressor regulatory pathways , '' '' '' ' but these remain speculative .
Alternatively , the finding of clonal eosinophilia in a patient with IHES could imply that somatic mutation affecting the eosinophil lineage is present in the patient , in the absence of karyotypic abnormalities , and that the patient has , in reality , a low-grade clonal myeloproliferative disorder .
Cases of IHES that show a clonal cytogenetic abnormality should be classified as eosinophilic leukemia , '' and it has been argued that all cases of clonal eosinophilia should , by definition , be excluded from IHES.° The method of analysis that we have described would allow clonal eosinophilias to be distinguished from reactive eosinophilias in female patients presenting with IHES .
In summary , in the absence of karyotypic abnormalities , HUMARA analysis of isolated eosinophils can be used to detect clonal eosinophilias and can provide a marker to assess disease progression .
