To	O
continue	O
our	O
investigation	O
of	O
the	O
cellular	O
events	O
that	O
occur	O
following	O
human	O
CMV	O
(	O
HCMV	O
)	O
infection	O
,	O
we	O
focused	O
on	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
cellular	O
activation	O
following	O
viral	O
binding	O
to	O
human	B-cell_type
monocytes	I-cell_type
.	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
showed	O
that	O
viral	O
binding	O
induced	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
immunoregulatory	B-cell_type
genes	I-cell_type
(	O
IL-1beta	B-protein
,	O
A20	B-protein
,	O
NF-kappaB-p105/p50	B-protein
,	O
and	O
IkappaBalpha	B-protein
)	O
in	O
unactivated	O
monocytes	B-cell_type
and	O
that	O
neutralizing	B-protein
Abs	I-protein
to	O
the	O
major	O
HCMV	B-protein
glycoproteins	I-protein
,	O
gB	B-protein
(	O
UL55	B-protein
)	O
and	O
gH	B-protein
(	O
UL75	B-protein
)	O
,	O
inhibited	O
the	O
induction	O
of	O
these	O
genes	O
.	O

Next	O
,	O
we	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
these	O
viral	O
ligands	O
directly	O
up-regulated	O
monocyte	O
gene	O
expression	O
upon	O
their	O
binding	O
to	O
their	O
appropriate	O
cellular	O
receptors	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
investigated	O
if	O
HCMV	O
binding	O
also	O
resulted	O
in	O
the	O
translation	O
and	O
secretion	O
of	O
cytokines	B-protein
.	O

Our	O
results	O
showed	O
that	O
HCMV	O
binding	O
to	O
monocytes	B-cell_type
resulted	O
in	O
the	O
production	O
and	O
release	O
of	O
IL-1beta	B-protein
protein	I-protein
.	O

Because	O
these	O
induced	O
gene	O
products	O
have	O
NF-kappaB	B-DNA
sites	I-DNA
in	O
their	O
promoter	B-DNA
regions	I-DNA
,	O
we	O
next	O
examined	O
whether	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
up-regulation	O
of	O
nuclear	O
NF-kappaB	B-protein
levels	O
.	O

These	O
experiments	O
showed	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
NF-kappaB	B-protein
was	O
translocated	O
to	O
the	O
nucleus	O
following	O
viral	O
binding	O
or	O
purified	O
viral	O
ligand	O
binding	O
.	O

Changes	O
in	O
IkappaBalpha	B-protein
levels	O
correlated	O
with	O
the	O
changes	O
in	O
NF-kappaB	B-protein
translocation	O
.	O

Lastly	O
,	O
we	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
p38	B-protein
kinase	O
activity	O
played	O
a	O
central	O
role	O
in	O
IL-1beta	B-protein
production	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
rapidly	O
up-regulated	O
following	O
infection	O
.	O

These	O
results	O
support	O
our	O
hypothesis	O
that	O
HCMV	O
initiates	O
a	O
signal	O
transduction	O
pathway	O
that	O
leads	O
to	O
monocyte	O
activation	O
and	O
pinpoints	O
a	O
potential	O
mechanism	O
whereby	O
HCMV	O
infection	O
of	O
monocytes	B-cell_type
can	O
result	O
in	O
profound	O
pathogenesis	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
chronic	O
inflammatory-type	O
conditions	O
