The	O

an	O

the	O

In	O
this	O
report	O
,	O
we	O
show	O
that	O
the	O
minimal	O
CD4	B-DNA
promoter	I-DNA
has	O
four	O
factor	B-DNA
binding	I-DNA
sites	I-DNA
,	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
required	O
for	O

Using	O
biochemical	O
and	O
mutagenesis	O
analyses	O
,	O
we	O
determined	O
that	O
multiple	O
nuclear	B-protein
factors	I-protein
bind	O
to	O
these	O
independent	O
sites	O

We	O
determined	O
that	O
an	O
initiator-like	B-DNA
sequence	I-DNA
present	O
at	O
the	O
cap	B-DNA
site	I-DNA
and	O
an	O
Ets	B-DNA

sequence	I-DNA
are	O
required	O
for	O
full	O

We	O
also	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
the	O
Myc-associated	B-protein
zinc	I-protein

(	O

appears	O
to	O
be	O
the	O

these	O

This	O

We	O
therefore	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O

also	O
